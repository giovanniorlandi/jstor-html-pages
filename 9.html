In response to that demand I pursue three \naims in this article. First, I examine why it is important to infuse both indigenous knowledge and Western \nscience into the school science curriculum. Second, I discuss Jegede’s collateral learning theory and Piaget’s \ntheories relating to cognitive development in order to explain not only how African learners learn science but, \nmore specifically, the cognitive challenges they might face when the focus is only on Western knowledge. \nThird, I recommend some teaching approaches on how to domesticate and infuse Western science with \nindigenous knowledge in the science classroom. Accordingly, I present practical examples of the ways in which \nteachers can teach both bodies of knowledge to make science more meaningful and appropriate to most African \nlearners. I want to stimulate thinking about the importance of indigenous knowledge in school science today, as \nwell as consider the implications for a shift in teacher pedagogy that a decolonial curriculum requires.  \n \nKeywords: decolonisation, Western science, Indigenous knowledge; science; teaching strategies  \nIntroduction \nWhat started out as a war against statues in universities and across South Africa in 2015 \ncoalesced into a demand for free higher education and the decolonisation of the university in \n2016. Subsequently, the nationwide student protests towards the end of 2015 and in 2016 led \nto the president of South Africa, in 2016, publicly announcing free education for the poor, \nwhile the minster of higher education made the announcement that the university curriculum \nmust be decolonised. These developments in universities served as an urgent wake-up call for \nthe Department of Basic Education to decolonise school curricula, especially the school \nscience curriculum. African scholars had argued for decades that African children, in their illfated\nrelationship with school science, continued to be caught up in Western frameworks of \nthinking that caused serious cognitive conflicts (Aikenhead, 1996; Jegede, 1999; le Grange, \n', 'Koopman: Towards decolonising teaching strategies . . .    103 \n \n  \n  \n2007, 2008, 2017; Ogunniyi, 2007; Ogunniyi & Ogawa, 2008).The question that now arises \nis: What does the phrase decolonising the curriculum mean? \nTo le Grange (2016), decolonisation meant Africanising the curriculum. Simply put, this \nentails the inclusion of a body of knowledge that is underpinned by African philosophical \nthinking and social practices that have evolved over thousands of years. He emphasised the \npoint that Western science should not be discounted or completely removed from the \ncurriculum but infused with indigenous knowledge. Ethieyibo (2016) viewed decolonisation \nas the “adoption, appropriation and incorporation of salient features or characteristics, \nexperiences, practices, beliefs, values and modes of the African way of life that are \nrepresentative and distinctive of sub-Saharan black people” (p. 405). This means that the \ndecolonisation project should rupture and challenge the Western ideas and knowledge that \ndominate school science. Ethieyibo was in agreement with le Grange when he pointed out \nthat instead of following a radical approach to decolonisation—the total exclusion of Western \nknowledge from the curriculum—a more moderate approach should be adopted; Western and \nindigenous knowledge should be taught as complementary bodies of knowledge. According \nto Ogunniyi (2007), if we continue to ignore these African insights, ideas, and values in our \nschool science curricula, we become complicit in epistemic injustice.  \nGiven that the overwhelming majority of South African learners are African, it is essential \nthat school science be presented as a bicultural engagement in which both Western science \nand indigenous knowledge are fused in order to create equivalences and connections between \nthe two knowledge systems so that learners can negotiate new personal meanings. This raises \nthe question that is also my main focus in this paper: How can the suggestions for the \ninclusion of indigenous knowledge into the school science curriculum be realised at the \nclassroom interface? If the aim is to adopt a moderate approach to decolonisation, another \nequally important question arises: How can science teachers domesticate Western science in \ntheir classrooms? The term domesticate, as Wiredu (2005) noted, means to present \nknowledge that is foreign to a person in ways that take into account the lived realities of that \nperson. He has argued for the harmonisation of Western individualism with African \ntraditional communalism. According to Waghid (2014), domestication here refers to using \nAfrican thinking and ways of life as a basis from which to introduce Western knowledge. In \nthe context of this paper, domestication of Western science means that teachers should \ndeconstruct Western ideas and present them to their learners in ways that are directly linked \nto their everyday lived realities in order to make science more meaningful, appropriate, and \nrelevant in every way to school children. \nWhy are both Western science and indigenous knowledge \nimportant to school science? \nHere I point out, first, why it is important to incorporate both indigenous knowledge and \nWestern science into the school science curriculum. Second, drawing on Jegede’s (1999) \ncollateral learning theory and Piaget’s (1954) cognitive learning theory, I discuss how \nAfrican learners learn science, and consider the cognitive challenges they face when the focus \n', '104    Journal of Education, No. 74, 2018 \n \nis only on Western knowledge. Third, I suggest effective teaching approaches that will give \ndue recognition to both Western and indigenous knowledge and will fuse these knowledges. \nTo do this, I present practical examples of how teachers can teach both bodies of knowledge \nto make science more meaningful and appropriate to most African learners. Before I do this, \nthough, I must shift the discussion to a consideration of why both Western and indigenous \nknowledges are important in the science classroom. \nNiezen (2003) explained how indigeneity emerged as such a salient feature in the aftermath \nof colonialism and genocide when he wrote that “indigeneity is an identity, like that which \nunifies survivors of the Holocaust, grounded in evidence, testimony and collective evidence” \n(p.15). Simon (2010) noted that each indigenous community has its own history of \ncolonialism, resistance, and agency. In Africa the term indigenous people is seldom used and \nis more often replaced with terms such as tribes or ethnic groups (Eversole, 2005). Shizha \n(2008) described indigenous people in Africa as all African citizens who are African not \nthrough being the offspring of settlers or colonisers. His view is that these indigenous people \nhave a long history of African ancestry and identify with many rural communities. It is in \nthese cultural lifestyles embedded in authentic spiritual, ecological, and holistic economic \nand political experiences that indigenous knowledge has its roots. Gratton (2003) echoed the \nnotion that a unique philosophy drives indigenous communities and provides an indigenous \nintellectual matrix to the respective groups. According to Oruka (1990), in each indigenous \ncommunity sages (wise men and women) play a critical role in establishing these intellectual \nmatrices as they critically evaluate what might be considered acceptable ways of \nunderstanding the world. These acceptable ways are what give rise to indigenous knowledge \namong local communities. Battiste, thus, defined indigenous knowledge as the “vibrant \nrelationships between the people, their ecosystems, and the other living beings and spirits that \nshare their lands” (as cited in Battiste & Henderson, 2000, p. 42). Ogunniyi and Ogawa \n(2008) explained the term in much more detail. \nThe term indigenous knowledge stands for an idea or system of thought peculiar to \nthe so-called natives of a particular geographical location or socio-cultural \nenvironment. This implies that the knowledge has not been borrowed from another \nlocality or culture or, if borrowed, it has become so assimilated into the new culture \nthat it is difficult if not impossible to identify its original character or foreignness. (p. \n177) \nDei, Hall, and Rosenberg (2000), in agreement with the above view, stated that the focus of \nthis knowledge is on traditional norms and social values as well as on the mental constructs \nthat guide, organise, and regulate people’s lifeworld. Ellen, Parkes, and Bicker (2000) noted \nthree elements in indigenous knowledge: (i) the outcome of a dynamic system, which they \nrefer to as the innovative talents of each indigenous person; (ii) an indispensable part of the \nphysical and social environment of the community; and (iii) collective well-being. All these \nelements form a system of thought and ideas that are anthropomorphic, monistic, and \nmetaphysical in nature. Furthermore, they are local or specific to a particular place. This \n', 'Koopman: Towards decolonising teaching strategies . . .    105 \n \n  \n  \nknowledge is informed by a latent worldview that drives the everyday actions and behaviour \nof many African people.  \nWhat separates indigenous knowledge from knowledge in the Western tradition is that the \nformer excludes colonial and imperial impositions. As I have argued elsewhere (Koopman, \n2017), in order for knowledge to be classified as valid Western knowledge, it must be (i) \nempirically verifiable, (ii) conform to ontological principles, theories, and laws, and (iii) be \nexperientially consistent. Therefore, based on the fact that science is driven by the principles \nof empiricism, quantification, reductionism, and anthropocentricism (Ogunniyi & Ogawa, \n2008), it shares common features with indigenous knowledge such as logic, common sense, \ncreativity, place, and, in some cases, serendipity. Ogunniyi and Ogawa (2008) have explained \nthe connectedness of the two knowledge types by looking at how modern medicine and \nindigenous knowledge have complemented each other for decades. They explained how \nhundreds of medicinal plant species have been studied for their use as therapeutic agents \nand/or their dietary properties. Furthermore, there is consensus in the literature that both \nWestern science and indigenous knowledge are in search of arriving at an understanding of \nhuman experiences in relation to nature and of the knowledge necessary to live a normal life. \nAikenhead (1996) pointed out that both these knowledge types are governed by borders that \nare very porous given that people often find themselves in between the two systems, the \nborders of which can be crossed with relative ease, depending on how embedded a person is \nin a particular worldview. However, when it comes to formal spaces of learning, indigenous \nknowledge is often globally viewed as inadequate and inferior to Western traditions and, \ntherefore, it is argued in the literature that it should not form part of school science curricula. \nMany science education scholars, such as Aikenhead (1996), Jegede (1999), Kapoor and \nShizha (2010), as well as Ogunniyi and Ogawa (2008) have disagreed with this view and \nargued that a solution to the main challenges—such as poverty, economic marginalisation, \nhazardous health conditions, and poor education—facing the African continent lie in the \ndesign and development of programmes that recognise that indigenous knowledge is the \nbedrock of the African psyche and way of life. While these scholars have argued for an \nindigenised curriculum, le Grange (2008) and Waghid (2014) have advocated for a marriage \nbetween the two knowledge traditions as a way of domesticating knowledge. Le Grange \n(2008), on his part, has argued that the fusion of Western science and indigenous knowledge \ncould take us to new knowledge spaces that could have transformative effects for South \nAfrica’s science programmes. He supported this argument by explaining how the Aborigines \nin Northern Australia domesticated Western knowledge and ideas by mapping every tree and \nsignificant terrain using digital satellite technology and made this available through \ngeographical information systems to the West. Waghid (2014), in agreement with le Grange \n(2008), has cautioned us that education in South Africa should not be only about invoking the \nAfrican voice, values, and identity because this would create the idea that there is a single, \nhomogenous, and monolithic African culture and identity. Instead of polarising Western and \nindigenous ideas, he argued, Western knowledge should be considered as a complementary \nbody of knowledge. He explained this idea by pointing out that a medical cure for HIV and \nAIDS should not rely solely on traditional herbal remedies prescribed by local traditional \n', '106    Journal of Education, No. 74, 2018 \n \nhealers. So, instead of rejecting Western solutions to the HIV and AIDS pandemic, people \ncan use both antiretroviral and herbal remedies to treat sufferers. Marginalising Western \nknowledge and ideas means discounting rich contributions from knowledge developed \nelsewhere. Another reason why both bodies of knowledge are important in the science \nclassroom is that most teachers in South Africa—unlike those who lived in rural villages and \nwho have their roots and cultural experiences in indigenous communities—received their \ntraining at school and university level in the tradition of Western science and, therefore, most \nteachers need first to be trained in the traditions of indigenous knowledge. \nHow African learners learn science  \nAccording to Piaget (1954), the cognitive development of a child is centred on the child’s \nmental processes such as perceiving, remembering, believing, and reasoning. These mental \ncomputations are directly dependent on the child’s experiences in the real world through \ndoing and acting in it. In other words, the world is not just observed and imitated by the child, \nbut also interpreted. While Piaget’s theory looked at cognitive development among children \nin general, Jegede’s (1999) collateral theory is specific to science and explained how a child \ncopes cognitively when introduced to hostile learning environments—such as African \nlearners being introduced to Western science. Because of the resilience of African learners’ \ncultural frameworks, it is important to understand their cognitive development (from the \nperspective of both Piaget’s and Jegede’s frameworks of learning) in order to become aware \nof their different ways of coping when they are introduced to school science, and how a \nduality of thought in their memory and schemata arises. \nJegede (1999) identified four different types of collateral learning—parallel, simultaneous, \ndependent, and secure—that take place in the science classroom when an African learner is \nconfronted with Western science. According to Piaget (1954), each of these different types of \nlearning can lead to different ways of understanding and cognitive assimilation, depending on \nthe child’s continuous organisation and reorganisation of information through experience. In \nthe light of this, le Grange (2007) has stated that these four different types of collateral \nlearning should not be viewed as discrete or existing in isolation from one another but must \nbe viewed as occurring on a continuum over time because one type can lead to the next.  \nAccording to Jegede (1999), parallel collateral learning takes place when the learner holds \ntwo conflicting or opposing ideas side by side at the same time. This means the learner stores \nboth the scientific knowledge and the indigenous or cultural knowledge in his or her longterm\nmemory at the same time with minimal interference and interaction. This is evident in \nlearners who are introduced to school science for the first time. According to Piaget (1954), \nthe mental structures of children at an early age are still underdeveloped. These mental \nstructures, which are made up of the motor and sensory modalities, limit very young \nchildren’s mental functioning. As they become older, they learn how to (re)construct these \nsensory modalities to deal with their environments or, in this case, with the learning material. \nIn other words, the learning of new ideas grows out of a child’s processing and understanding \nof prior ideas (Piaget, 1954). According to Singer and Revenson (1996), the child in the \n', 'Koopman: Towards decolonising teaching strategies . . .    107 \n \n  \n  \nscience classroom, during parallel collateral learning, experiences what Piaget referred to as \nadaptation, which he described as the most basic principle of human functioning. These \nauthors aver that adaptation takes place when the child processes information by using his or \nher environment or experiences as a primer to adjust his or her cognitive processes. Further \ncognitive dissonance arises for a child when the learning material with which the child is \nconfronted is not domesticated in order to make science more meaningful and appropriate to \nthe lived realities of the child. Instead, the science presented to the child is beyond the child’s \nindigenous outlook on the world.  \nThe second type of collateral learning is simultaneous collateral learning. This process takes \nplace over a longer period of time than does parallel collateral learning. This is because by \nthe time learners are introduced to the new scientific information, they might still be \nprocessing a concept they learned at home or in their cultural setting. This means the learner \nhas to resolve the tension between the two concepts at the same time because both are new to \nhis or her cosmos (Jegede, 1999). This process within which a child is confronted with two \nopposing worldviews, Piaget (1954) called assimilation. He described assimilation as the \nprocess in which the child takes in new information and fits it into a preconceived notion or \nidea about the world (Singer & Revenson, 1996). During this process, the child incorporates \nthe new Western idea into his or her cognitive framework and remembers it for future use. \nThe way the learner resolves this tension between the two different worldviews (Western and \nindigenous) depends on the fruitfulness and plausibility of the knowledge for the child; this \nleads to the third type of collateral learning.  \nThe third type is dependent collateral learning. This takes place when the schema from the \nWestern scientific worldview challenges the child’s cultural or indigenous worldview, \nenabling the learner to restructure or modify his or her existing schemata. The shift to the \nnew schemata is triggered by what the learner already knows. This means the learner can \nmake a shift in favour of, or against, the cultural worldview—depending on what already \nexists in his or her mind. Piaget (1954) referred to this process as accommodation. During \nthis (accommodation) process, the child attempts to understand Western science by applying \nthe prevailing cultural framework or an old experience (assimilation). If this does not work, \nthe child is forced to change his or her existing conception in order to interpret the new \nknowledge or idea. This stage of cognitive development can also be described as a dual \nprocess, namely the assimilation–accommodation process. \nThe fourth and last type of collateral learning is secured collateral learning. Jegede (1999) \nargued that this type of collateral learning takes place over a long period of time in which the \nlearner must resolve the tension between the two opposing knowledge frameworks. This \nmeans that the learner must resolve what he, Jegede, terms cognitive dissonance in the \nknowledge base of the embedded long-term memory. This cognitive dissonance represents \nthe conflicting worldviews implicit in the Western science with which the learner is \nconfronted in the science classroom, and in the cultural knowledge he or she brings to the \nclassroom. To resolve the conflict, Jegede (1999) argued, the learner draws from a \n“convergence towards commonality” (p. 135) that secures the newly acculturated conception. \n', '108    Journal of Education, No. 74, 2018 \n \nThis acculturated conception is what Piaget (1954) referred to as the construction or \nformation of the schema through a process of adaptation. He explained that a schema is a \nsimple mental image or “pattern of action, a form of organizing information that a person \nuses to interpret the things she sees, hears, smells and touches” (cited in Singer & Revenson, \n1996, p. 17). A schema organises perceptions, ideas, and understanding of the world the way \na computer organises its files and documents. When necessary, the child can retrieve the \ninformation stored in his or her memory to solve a scientific problem. This process of \ncognitive accommodation can take place more smoothly if the teacher can domesticate the \nWestern ideas by linking them to the child’s lived experience.  \nWhile Jegede’s (1999) collateral learning theory explains how the learner copes with \ndifferent experiences in the science classroom, Piaget’s (1954) view of cognitive \ndevelopment explains the intellectual processes that takes place in the mind of the child when \nintroduced to Western science. These theories remind science teachers of the importance of \ndomesticating Western knowledge and ideas when introducing them to African learners. \nDuring transitional periods, the child might be in one of the four stages regarding his or her \nunderstanding of school science. These stages are not directly related to specific age groups \nand can vary widely. What is of greatest significance is that before teachers introduce their \nlearners to abstract scientific concepts, it is important that they first help learners understand \nthe concrete scientific terms and ideas.  \nPersonal–Cultural–Localised Learning (PCLL) \nGiven the overwhelming evidence in the literature that points to poor science teaching, and \nthe cry for decolonisation in South African classrooms and lecture theatres, there appears to \nbe a paucity of effective pedagogical strategies to facilitate curriculum change. According to \nOgunniyi (2007), despite concerted efforts by the new government in South Africa to \nencourage teachers to incorporate indigenous knowledge in their science classrooms, teachers \ncontinue to dismiss indigenous ways of knowing because (i) they were trained in the tradition \nof Western science and are not familiar with the precepts of indigenous science and (ii) \nteachers resist changes to their pedagogical strategies in terms of contextualisation and \nindigenisation. Therefore, instead of complementing Western modern science with \nindigenous, as prescribed in CAPS and all its predecessor curricula such as OBE, NCS, and \nso forth (see DBE, 2011), science teachers place more emphasis on Western science because \nof the pressure to achieve high test scores and good examination results.  \nOne approach that I want to introduce here has been adapted from Schmidt, Rosenberg, and \nBeymer’s (2018) person-oriented approach to learner engagement, in which Western and \nindigenous knowledge can be fused in what I refer to as personal, cultural and localised \nlearning (PCLL). Personal, in PCLL, refers to the teacher and his or her role in becoming \ncognisant of the context in which he or she teaches. More specifically, personal lived \nexperiences are part of the experiential knowledge of nature that the child brings into the \nclassroom. According to Fitts and Posner (1967), all knowledge and skills have their roots in \npeople’s interactions with the real world. They argued that our minds operate like computers \n', 'Koopman: Towards decolonising teaching strategies . . .    109 \n \n  \n  \nprocessing information from the environment through a series of learnt rules. As a child \nexperiences phenomena and, in the process, learns and develops a skill, he or she learns to \nrefine the rules in order to master the skill. For example, young children might not have a full \nunderstanding of gravity, but they are aware that objects in free fall are pulled downwards by \nsome inexplicable force. Another example is the observation that a brick sinks and a ball \nfloats when they are dropped into water. Although children might not have a holistic \nunderstanding of density and buoyancy, they do have real experiences of such events. \nCultural and localised knowledge refers to the cultural knowledge acquired in the localised \ncommunity within which the child resides. According to Aikenhead (1996), in most cases the \nknowledge the learner holds, from the traditional perspective, comes from the meaning and \nidentity acquired by him or her through the local community’s indigenous cultural identity. \nAccording to Wallace (2004), when a teacher becomes aware of the cultural understandings \nof the learners, he or she moves away from the privileged authoritative discourse and \ndominance of school science and provides indigenous learners with improved access to \nWesternised science. This allows the teacher to domesticate and fuse the knowledge systems \nby first embracing and validating local people’s own ways of understanding, while also \nallowing the teacher space to negotiate new meanings that can possibly resolve the \ndichotomy of dual thought. One of the drawbacks of this approach is that gathering such \nalternative views embedded in a cultural discourse is time consuming and limits the teacher’s \ncontact time with the learners. However, a plethora of alternative approaches may be found in \nthe literature. For example, by networking with the research community and experts in \nindigenous knowledge, teachers can gather (or survey) and become aware of many localised \nideas and knowledge. These ideas and worldviews can be shared in their respective clusters \nfrom district offices. This raises the question: How can teachers apply PCLL in their \nclassrooms? \nOnce the teacher has gathered or collected personalised experiences and cultural \nunderstandings from the learners, when introducing a topic or concept, for example, such as \nlightning as a form of static electricity, it is important that the teacher has a good \nunderstanding of the African concept of umbane. This concept of umbane illustrates the \ndestructive capacity of a sangoma who is believed to have supernatural powers. This means \nthat a sangoma has the power to generate and direct lightning to a particular house, which can \nhave serious destructive consequences. Hence, lightning in African traditions is not a natural \nphenomenon but a form of witchcraft that indicates that a person has angered the ancestors. \nIn the Western tradition, lightning has a completely different meaning; it is explained \nscientifically as occurring or taking place when lighter subatomic particles in a cloud move \ntowards the upper part of the cloud, which becomes positively charged in the process. \nHeavier subatomic particles in the clouds move towards the bottom and become negatively \ncharged. When the positive and negative charges become large enough, lightning is released \nbetween these regions. Most of the lightning takes place between the clouds, but some is \ndischarged and strikes the earth in bright flashes. These bright flashes are the discharge of \nelectrons, which have the potential to kill or injure animals or humans on the ground because \nthey contain thousands of volts that are released in a fraction of a second. \n', '110    Journal of Education, No. 74, 2018 \n \nIn other words, the role of the teacher in this instance is to adopt that of what le Grange \n(2008) called a cultural broker before invoking a Westernised explanation. If a teacher \nignores the cultural profile of the child, this creates what Jegede (1999) referred to as \ncollateral learning (as explained above) and, to bypass this dual conceptual notion, it is \nimportant to invite epistemological dialogue about such phenomena. This interepistemological\ndialogue allows the learner to negotiate meaning between the indigenous and \nWestern knowledges in order to create new knowledge spaces in which alternative views and \nideas are shared among learners coming from different cultures. Once teachers develop a \nrobust understanding of personalised or cultural data on various concepts, they can document \nthem in order to design teaching approaches and strategies that they can use to domesticate \ncomplex and abstract scientific concepts and fuse the two knowledge traditions. By doing so, \nlearning science becomes a two-way flow and no longer a unidirectional pathway of science \nteaching focusing only on Western ideas and explanations. Therefore, instead of just going \nthrough the motions of teaching science through hands-on activities and what we might call \ntalking science, learners see the wonder and beauty of both indigenous knowledge and \nWestern science as an integrated body of knowledge. Discounting indigenous knowledge is \none of the main challenges that can make learners unresponsive to the learning of Western \nscience (Aikenhead, 1996), with its abstract, complex language and terminology with which \nlearners struggle to connect. Acknowledging and merging the personal knowledge and \ncultural worldviews of learners with Western terminology and ideas could result in better \nunderstandings of science.  \nAnother outcome that could result from the inter-epistemological dialogue of fusing the two \nknowledge types is the development of a more learner-friendly language through which \nscience can be presented. This means that science teachers and local communities will have \nto collaborate in order to develop an indigenous vocabulary for science in the local \nlanguages; this is one way of resolving the tension between indigenous knowledge and \nWestern knowledge. Translating Western scientific precepts into local languages creates \nmultiple discourses and forms of dialogue that will promote greater interest in the scientific \ndescription of nature.  \nWhen teachers have documented personalised ideas and cultural data, they can shift the focus \nto group work, which can then be made more interesting not only by focusing on the \ntheoretical dimension, but also in providing learners with activities that involve data analysis \nand representation that they can discuss in their groups. \nI turn, now, to focus on process-oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) as an extension of \nPCLL to suggest a method for the delivery of scientific knowledge through group work. \nProcess-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) \nAccording to Treagust et al. (2018), process-oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) is one \nway to address the superficial engagement of learners with science in bridging the Western \nand indigenous cultural divide. This strategy has its roots in the Western tradition and has \nbeen used in schools in the Middle East to bridge the cultural–theory divide. While PCLL \n', 'Koopman: Towards decolonising teaching strategies . . .    111 \n \n  \n  \nfocuses on the subjective epistemological experiences of individual learners in their \nrespective communities, POGIL promotes group work as a learner-centred pedagogical \napproach in which both the practical and theoretical aspects of science are considered. \nTeaching within a POGIL paradigm, as Spencer and Moog (2008) have noted, requires the \nteacher to take on the role of a facilitator in which learning becomes a guided experience \nthrough group work. What is important in POGIL is that learners are introduced to both the \ntheoretical as well as the empirical aspects of science. This is done by allowing them to \nexplore concepts by examining data or information that is provided by the teacher, and which \nis set up in such a way that the learner experiences cognitive dissonance. Learners in the \ngroups have different roles to play—leader, recorder, presenter, reflector, or strategy \nanalyst—as well as other roles such as those of technician, encourager, and significant figure \nchecker. All these roles and their respective activities allow them to be introduced to the \ncultural context of their peers, while at the same time allowing them to get to know the world \nof the other and how it relates to science. The following scenario serves as an example of a \nclassroom activity aimed at fostering POGIL. \nTraditional medicine remains an important option in South Africa. The challenge \nremains that, as Africans become more educated, they seem to feel that herbal \nremedies are more primitive and have lost their place or function in society. This is \npartly because traditional practices are not documented in books and journals but are \npassed on to a family member through observation, engaging participation, and active \nlistening.  \nAphiwe was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with malaria. The following herbal \nremedies were prescribed or advised to treat the disease: Caesalpina volkensii, \nStrychnoshenningsii, Ajuga remota, and so forth. All these herbs can be described as \nantimalarial herbal remedies. However, the chief doctor at Hospital X, where Aphiwe \nhas been admitted, Dr Sibya, feels that Aphiwe should be treated with broad spectrum \nantibiotics. He also feels that it is irresponsible to entrust the life of a person to a \ntraditional healer who did not formally study medicine. Doing so, he feels, means we \nare moving back to ancient times. \n(i) Suppose Aphiwe is your son. Critically discuss in your groups what you think \nof Dr Sibya’s comment that it is irresponsible to trust a traditional healer. \n(ii) In your groups, prepare a 10-minute presentation on who you think should \ntreat Aphiwe.

(2018), deep engagement with science depends on context, which \ninfluences a learner’s momentary state while doing an activity. Therefore, it is important that \nteachers use proximal processes that motivate learners to engage with a particular topic. In \nother words, some learners might have a deep interest in discovering, by themselves, whether \nindigenous knowledge or Western science is credible, which will motivate them to a deeper \n', '112    Journal of Education, No. 74, 2018 \n \nengagement that involves not only the cognitive or empirical aspects, but also the \nbehavioural, cultural, and affective aspects. When indigenous knowledge is infused with \nWestern science in group work, it has the potential to spark a sense of belonging and to \ninfluence a learner’s willingness to participate in a particular lesson. Although he or she \nmight experience negative feelings such as boredom and anxiety (about some topics), peers \nmight introduce ideas that will encourage a response, which could then relate to a specific \ntopic. \nScaffolding the learners in their respective groups would, at times, require the teacher to take \non the role of what le Grange (2008) called a tour guide. This means that in cases where the \nlearners espouse strong traditional values, it is recommended that the teacher carefully guide \nthe learners away from creating further cognitive conflict and be mindful of the way he or she \nsets up the group work in relation to the scientific concept being investigated. In cases where \nthe learners are less deeply entrenched in traditional beliefs and values, the teacher is \nexpected to assume the role of a travel agent. While there will always be individual \ndifferences among learners within a particular group, learner contribution is important \nbecause it adds value to the learning process. The focus of the group should not be on right or \nwrong answers because some comments and responses might be interesting and enjoyable \nand could even serve as a form of entertainment to make the lesson more fun.  \nIn all these situations, it is imperative for the teacher to give learners the choice to select their \nown groups given that some might share common personal experiences while others might \nhave cultural values in common. Thus, choice can help them relate to the content they are \ntaught in a tangible and meaningful way by helping to shape knowledge construction and \nscientific reasoning. This will also create a more engaging classroom environment in which \nboth the teacher and the learners in their respective groups are actively involved in the sensemaking\nprocess. In such a paradigm, teaching and learning will make more sense to learners \nbecause the teacher draws from learners’ lived world and cultural experiences; this will make \nit more probable that they will be able to accommodate the new knowledge as a preamble to \nunderstanding Western traditions. Freudenthal (1991) pointed out that we should see science \nas a human activity and that, consequently, science teachers should guide students to \nscientificalise their world instead of trying to transfer scientific knowledge as a ready-made \nproduct. He alluded to the important role of teachers in guiding their learners in a pedagogy \nof engagement and nurturing them to participate in the knowledge-construction process. \nConclusion \nUnderstanding a learner’s personalised and cultural worldviews can help teachers to identify \nthe various barriers to learning with respect to understanding certain scientific concepts and \ndefinitions. Both personalised and cultural knowledge can be extremely valuable for teachers \nin the planning and sequencing of events when they deliver their lessons. Therefore, when \nteachers document personalised and cultural knowledge and ideas that are inconsistent with \nWestern notions of scientific understanding, they should develop and design learning \nactivities that, first, domesticate complex and abstract Western ideas and fuse both bodies of \n', 'Koopman: Towards decolonising teaching strategies . . .    113 \n \n  \n  \nknowledge. I argue that an attempt to fuse indigenous knowledge and Western science will, \nmost likely, encourage learner participation either through individualised instruction as \ndiscussed in PCCL, or in groups as discussed in POGIL. These two teaching strategies \nencourage rational engagement and meaning-making in which the learners are introduced to \ninstruction by being offered the chance to uphold traditional beliefs and cross the border to \nthe modern Westernised scientific worldview. These two strategies are consistent with the \nwork of various science education scholars such as Jegede (1999), le Grange (2008, 2017), \nOgunniyi (2007), and various others who have proposed that learning activities in the science \nclassroom should be framed in such a way that they develop deep scientific engagement in \nthe learners. Providing learners with the opportunity to solve problems by using their past \nexperiences and cultural knowledge is a step in the direction of decolonising the science \ncurriculum. (I do not address the issue of curriculum content because my main objective is to \nsuggest teaching strategies that can be used to implement both Western science and \nindigenous knowledge as complementary bodies of knowledge.) \nThe strategies presented in this paper can be used as a basis to generate personalised and local \ncultural knowledge that teachers can document. These personalised and culturally local ideas \nand notions generated in PCCL and POGIL could serve as the basis for developing an \nindigenised or localised cultural perspective on scientific phenomena. These phenomena can \nthen be exchanged in the respective clusters to develop a formal school science curriculum \nthat values the various alternative conceptions that can, in turn, be used as a basis to introduce \nnew concepts and topics in science. It is important to update such knowledge regularly given \nthat knowledge is not stationary but always shifting to incorporate new ways of \nunderstanding the world. \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback in \nstrengthening the academic quality of this article.
