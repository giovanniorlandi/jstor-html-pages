Aristotle (d. 322 BCE), for instance, was a\npoet, musician, philosopher, linguist, biologist, logician and physicist. Archimedes (d. 212\nBCE) was a scientist interested in mathematics, physics and astronomy and was also known\nas an inventor and engineer. Ptolemy (d. 170 CE) was also a polymath, known as a\nmathematician, astronomer, geographer and astrologer, and he contributed to the theory of\nmusic and optics. Al-Biruni (d. 1048 CE) was well versed in physics, astronomy, mathematics\nand was also a geographer, pharmacologist, historian and linguist. Ibn Al-Haytham (d. 965\nCE) was a mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, optician and theologian. Muhammad ibn\nZakariya Al-Razi (d. 925 CE), the Persian scientist, left his mark in medicine (especially in\npaediatrics and ophthalmology) and philosophy. Ibn Sina (d. 1037 CE) left an impressive\nlegacy in medicine, astronomy, philosophy, mathematics, physics, psychology, geography\nand theology. Ibn Al-Nafis (d. 1288 CE) was a well-known expert in jurisprudence and\nmedicine. Ibn Bajjah (d. 1138 CE) lived in Andalusia and left works on astronomy, physics,\nmusic, philosophy, botany and poetry. Musa ibn Maimun (d. 1204 CE), also known as\nMaimonides, was an eminent Jewish scholar who excelled in jurisprudence, philosophy,\nastronomy, medicine and theology. Galileo Galilei (d. 1642 CE) was an Italian astronomer,\nphysicist, engineer, philosopher andmathematician.\nThese scholars of the past who lived in various times and civilizations represent just a\nsmall portion of the polymaths who were interested in and worked in different fields of\nknowledge. It was a norm for scholars to master more than one discipline. Moreover, their\ncontributions were not only at the level of theoretical studies but had a huge impact on real\nlife. Hence, many applied sciences were developed by scholars who were also philosophers,\njurists or theologians.\nWhen it comes to Muslim scholars, their work represents a true ijtih\x01ad (hard work or\nperseverance) which led to beneficial knowledge. They were led by the worldview based on\nthe idea of taw \x01hīd (monotheism), the will to succeed with the help of Allah, and a\ncomprehensive methodology, which guided their scholarship. At present, we live in the age\nof narrow specializations, including the field of Islamic economics and finance. Often, the\neconomic and financial theories arrived at by experts in the field get translated into\ngovernment policies that affect the society as a whole. The mono-disciplinary approach\ntends to misinterpret the reality of this complex life and, thus, offers solutions that lead to\ncrises. Studying economic and financial behaviour from the purely positivist worldview and\nthen applying the corresponding economic policies has resulted in dozens of serious crises\nthroughout the world in the past century, including the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nOne level at which problems originate is methodology, whereby all subsequent research,\ndevelopment and policies are defined by the original approach.\nThis paper discusses methodology, its principles and its application to the field of Islamic\neconomics and finance. It also looks into the matter of integrated knowledge and proposes a\nmultidisciplinary methodology that combines the Sharīʿah (Islamic law) with human and\nnatural sciences and information and communication technology. Hence, this paper aims at\noffering solutions at the methodological level using the idea of collective ijtih\x01ad. Therefore,\nthe scope of this paper is only methodology from the viewpoint of integrated knowledge and\ndoes not cover such important issues as assumptions in economics and finance or technical\nissues such as usury/interest, financing, legal contracts, unemployment, inequality or\nscarcity.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Firstly, the matter of methodology, its definition,\nimportance and problems will be discussed. This will be followed by a short excursion into\nthe current methodology of Islamic economics and finance. Thirdly, the paper presents the\nidea of integrated knowledge as promoted by the International Institute of Islamic Thought\nIJIF\n12,1\n116\n', '(IIIT). This is followed by the exposition of the proposed multidisciplinary methodology that\nis based on the idea of collective ijtih\x01ad.\nMethodology: the essence, importance and problems\nLinguistically, methodology is defined as “a system of methods, principles, and rules for\nregulating a given discipline” (dictionary.com), “a system of ways of doing, teaching or\nstudying something” (dictionary.cambridge.org), “a system of methods used in a particular\narea of study or activity” (en.oxforddictionaries.com) or “a body of methods, rules, and\npostulates employed by a discipline” (www.merriam-webster.com). In a more technical or\nscientific sense, methodology refers to abstract thinking that precedes the actual output of\nthe discipline in the form of hypotheses, theories, models and policies. It has to do with the\nbackground (philosophical worldview) of the scholar/thinker, which influences their way of\nthinking about problems that need addressing. Machlup (1978, p. 54) maintains that\nmethodology is:\n[. . .] the study of the principles that guide students of any field of knowledge, and especially of\nany branch of higher learning (science) in deciding whether to accept or reject certain propositions\nas a part of the body of ordered knowledge in general or of their own discipline.\nand that it “provides arguments and rationalizations [. . .] for forming concepts, building\nmodels, formulating hypotheses, and testing theories” (Machlup, 1978, p. 55). In the same\nwork, Machlup (1978) summarizes various definitions of methodology and offers “AMap of\nTerritory”, which includes such subjects as formal logic; inductive logic; general\nmethodology; special methodology; epistemology; and ontology (pp. 58-59).\nBlaug (1992) states that methodology “denotes an investigation of the concepts, theories,\nand basic principles of reasoning of a subject [. . .] to be understood simply as philosophy of\nscience [. . .]” Al-Alwani (2006, p. 65) asserts that methodology is “the controls or criteria for\nhuman thought which are derived from an authoritative framework qualified to identify the\nmeans for producing, generating and selecting ideas”. He also states that methodology is\nsomething that “lends order to concepts and theories, adapting laws in such a way that they\nare cohesive and mutually consistent”. Malkawi (2014, p. xvi) concurs with Al-Alwani (2006)\nby stating that throughout history, human beings have always been aware of orderly and\nsystematic thinking to achieve goals. Hasan (2018) writes that methodology, on the one\nhand, is a branch of epistemology that is interested in philosophical underpinnings of\ntheory, and on the other, it helps economists design research projects and fixes their goals.\nSiddiqi (2001, p. 5) suggests that economic methodology discussions revolve around\nmethods of understanding and evaluating economic theories (confirmation, falsification,\nscientific revolutions, research programs, etc.), methods of investigation (deduction,\ninduction, experiments, etc.), basic assumptions (such as rationality, utility and profit\nmaximization) and scope of the discipline (positive v. normative). The important element\nthat unites the above definitions of the methodology is that it is a kind of human reasoning\nat a conceptual level guiding the initial process of research or investigation into any social or\nnatural phenomena. Moreover, the dominant view of methodology, especially in the fields of\neconomics and finance, is that it is not concerned with normative notions of morality and\nworldview. Hence, the approach to studying the discipline of the methodology is strictly\ntechnical and positive, and thus the methods, procedures, processes of research and\ndevelopment in formal economics, as well as their outcomes, are limited. In contrast, the\nterm traditionally used by Muslim scholars has a different connotation and thus, the\nmethodological discussion tends to be more inclusive and integrated.\nMethodology\nof integrated\nknowledge\n117\n', 'As definitions of methodology in the English language point to a “system” or “way”,\nlikewise, in Arabic, it is represented by the term minh\x01aj or manhajiyyah, which refers to a\nclear and easy path. In the Qur’\x01an, it is mentioned in the same verse as the word shirʿah,\nfromwhich Sharīʿah is derived andwhich also denotes a path (to a watering place).\nUnto every one of you have We appointed a law (shirʿah) and a way of life (minh\x01aj). And if God\nhad so willed, He could surely have made you all in one single community: but [He willed it\notherwise] in order to test you by means of what He has vouchsafed unto you. Vie, then, with one\nanother in doing good works! (Qur’\x01an, 5:48)\nCommentators have offered numerous explanations of these words, the first word (shirʿah)\nusually refers to divine law, from which jurists derive legal rulings, while the second word\n(minh\x01aj) refers to a clear path to follow, meaning a way of life or, for the Islamic scientific\ncommunity, a methodology that is based on the divine law. Malkawi (2014, pp. 40-49) offers\nan excellent review of the aforementioned terms, and, as a conclusion for ‘methodology’,\nstates that the term:\n[. . .] intersect[s] with human ways of thinking, as well as with logic as a branch of philosophy;\nwith the theory of knowledge and epistemology as a branch and science of philosophy; and with\nmethods of searching for knowledge in this or that field (Malkawi, 2014, p. 48).\nHence, with reference to science, methodology refers to the scientific process of research and\nthe tools, methods and procedures used to gather and analyse data.\nAccording to Auda (2010, p. 31, 107), much of the Islamic and Western methodology of\nscience is based on the Greek system of logic, which uses the concept of “decomposition”\nthat seeks to break the studied phenomena into smaller parts and then to define and classify.\nAuda (2010, p. 32) writes:\nPlato’s and Aristotle’s methods of decomposition had a great impact on human thought over the\npast two millennia, which was manifested in various ways. Examples are Ibn Rushd’s “divisions\nof categories,” Aquinas’s “resolution,” Descarte’s “reduction to simplest terms,” Locke’s resolution\nof ideas into simple “sense impressions,” Leibniz’s reduction of propositions into “self-evident\ntruths,” Kant’s subclasses of “synthetic a priori truths,” Fredge’s “logical analysis,” Russell’s\n“deductive chains,” and even Wittgenstein’s ‘grammatical investigation.’\nDespite the sophistication of analysis based on “decomposition”, it is actually quite\nsimplistic, whereby the holistic nature of phenomena tends to be overlooked. Hence, the\nmethodology used by the positivists, as demonstrated next, produces inaccurate conclusions\nbecause such methodology is static and overlooks the “dynamics of change” (Auda, 2010,\np. 33). Choudhury (2014, p. 110) concurs with Auda and writes that “[t]he methodology of\noccidental science, society organization and self, remains partitioned and pluralistic”\nwhereby the holistic nature of worldly existence is overlooked.\nModern social sciences have philosophical underpinnings, which have been influenced\nby Greek philosophy, which was studied and transmitted by Muslims and matured in\nWestern Europe from the times of the Enlightenment. Historically, the philosophy of science\nin the West grew from being dominated by Christian ethics to its present form of being\ndevoid of religious inclinations. Dow (2013, p. 3) writes that currently the methodology of\nmainstream economics (and by extension also of finance and other social sciences) is\ndominated by logical positivism, which “requires that scientific statements must be testable\nagainst facts [. . .], and the conventional judgement [. . .] is that only mathematical\nstatements are precise enough for robust testing.” In another place, Dow (1985, p. 10) asserts\nthat methodologymust be considered at two levels:\n(1) at the technical level with implications for model building; and\nIJIF\n12,1\n118\n', '(2) at the level of “[. . .] the underlying, and often implicit, world-view of the theorist”.\nHistorically, logical positivism (also known as logical empiricism), although influenced by\nthe ideas of Ernst Mach (1838-1916), formally starts with the Vienna Circle. It is known for a\nnumber of influential thinkers (Moritz Schlick, Otto Neurath, Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn,\nRudolf Carnap and Carl Hempel), most of whom were recognized scientists in various fields.\nFor example, Hans Hahn (d. 1934) was a mathematician, Philipp Frank (d. 1966) and Moritz\nSchlick (d. 1936) were physicists, and Rudolf Carnap (d. 1970) was a philosopher. The\nVienna Circle proposed that for knowledge to be scientific it must be based on verifiable\n(testable) sensory experience (Caldwell, 1994). There is thus no place for value statements,\nwhich simply express emotional attitude. It also denies a priori knowledge, the ability to\n“report truths about nature” (Blanshard, 2002). Metaphysics was regarded as being close to\ninsanity (Mayhall, 2003).\nAs the Second World War approached, many Vienna Circle activists fled to the USA and\nthe UK, where they greatly influenced the scientific communities. In the USA, the movement\ntransformed into “philosophy of science”, thanks to Carl Hempel (d. 1997). The academic\ncircles in Europe and North America have evidently adopted positivism as a creed and\napplied it to all spheres of social sciences, including economics.\nMilton Friedman (American economist, received the Nobel memorial prize in economics\nin 1976, died in 2006) wrote about positive economics:\nPositive economics is in principle independent of any particular ethical position or normative\njudgments. As Keynes says, it deals with “what is,” not with “what ought to be.” Its task is to\nprovide a system of generalizations that can be used to make correct predictions about the\nconsequences of any change in circumstances. Its performance is to be judged by the precision,\nscope, and conformity with experience of the predictions it yields. In short, positive economics is,\nor can be, an “objective” science, in precisely the same sense as any of the physical sciences\n(Friedman, 1966, p. 4).\nThe methodology of logical positivism, as described by Friedman, has one major flaw,\nwhich makes it rigid and unrealistic – the task of prediction. Lack of realism in the\nmainstream economic and finance methodology causes theories, which are translated into\nmodels and policies, to be unfeasible and unworkable. Often, the problem is compounded by\npure mathematical modelling, whereby the focus is on the process of theorizing itself, and on\nthe beauty and purity of mathematical expressions rather than practicality. By playing\naround with limited amounts of data and a limited number of variables used for prediction,\neconomists nevertheless consistently fail to pinpoint crises, which are occurring more and\nmore frequently. It seems that the members of the mainstream economics and finance\nprofession fail to understand that the future is simply unknowable and thus impossible to\naccurately predict (Lawson, 1997).\nFrankfurter (2007) critiques Friedman’s essay titled “The Methodology of Positive\nEconomics” (1966), which Frankfurter writes is not value-neutral but, rather, a “belief\nsystem that underlay the research program which colonized economic thinking for the last\nhalf century [. . .]. We call this ideology ‘neoclassical economics’” (Frankfurter, 2007). Hence,\nit is clear that despite seeming neutrality in the methodology of mainstream neoclassical\neconomics and finance, it is ideological to the core and not value-free (Hall and Elliot, 1999).\nMoreover, the positivist paradigm has dominated much of economic policymaking as well\nas economic education in the past 100 years. The same positivist paradigm has influenced\nMuslim economists and finance practitioners educated in the Western system, which led to\nthe imitation of the conventional system.\nMethodology\nof integrated\nknowledge\n119\n', 'Lastly, the implication of the flawed methodology is that modern economics and finance\ncreate beliefs that interest is a necessary cost of loanable funds, scarcity is inevitable,\nmarkets are efficient, commercial banks are financial intermediaries, individual interest\nequals societal interest and other “self-evident truths” (for a detailed review of these issues,\nplease see: www.binaryeconomics.net/wordpress/fundamentals/fifty-nine-false-assumptionsof-mainstream-neo-classical-economics/,\nn.d.; Ashford and Shakespeare, 1999; Shakespeare,\n2007). Also, the issue of money is at the heart of modern economics and finance, but its reality\nis not properly presented (Meera, 2004; Shakespeare, 2005). There are numerous other issues\nin economics and finance that are the result of the wrong methodology with misleading or\neven wrong assumptions. However, this paper’s scope does not allow us to go deeper into\nthose issues. It is important to note that the methodology of modern Islamic economics and\nfinance suffers from the same flaws as conventional economics and finance and that is the\nfocus of the next section.\nCurrent methodology of Islamic economics and finance\nMethodology, according to Hasan (2006, p. 9), is philosophical in nature and is outside the\nsubject. Addas (2008, p. 4) opines that methodology deals with:\n[. . .] purpose of [. . .] inquiry, the sources of knowledge relevant to it, the subject matter and the\nscope of its inquiry, the limits to the application of knowledge, and the decisions about\nappropriate structure for erecting [. . .] theories [. . .].\nHe also suggests that “methodology helps explain the nature of the theories behind [. . .]\nhuman action; it also aims at prescribing acceptable methods and techniques of [. . .] inquiry\nin order to enlarge the stock of knowledge”.\nThe methodology of Islamic economics grew as a response to methodological flaws of\nneoclassical economics as outlined above. The main thesis of Islamic economists about\nmethodology is that the discipline itself is not strictly positive as a pure science ought to be.\nAlso, they argue against the main assumptions of neoclassical economics such as\nrationality, utility, profit maximization and self-interest (Siddiqi, 2001). With regard to the\nmethods of investigation, there is debate about deduction, induction or experimentation/\ndemonstration. Historically, Muslim scientists used all these methods (Nasr, 1980). Hence,\nthese methods should be applicable to the study of Islamic economics. However, much\ncaution must be exercised with regard to the inductive method as over-reliance on it may\nproduce erroneous results because of limited data (Hume, 1910; Taleb, 2007). Hasan (2018)\nalso cautions against the methodology prevalent in conventional economics discourse\nbecause of “injudicious use of mathematics and econometric modelling for a variety of\nreasons [. . .] especially to shun temptation for predatory publishing”. His article (Hasan,\n2018) seems to suggest, however, that we should not be overly concerned with methodology\nbut recognize it as “a continuous interpretation of sources of knowledge in view of social\ndynamism [. . .]” and reality on the ground.\nWhen it comes to a methodology of deriving rulings that affect the Islamic economic\nsystem, Kahf (2020) is of the opinion that it should be done using an approach that is similar\nto qaw\x01aʿid fiqhiyyah (legal maxims) through the study of fiqh (jurisprudence, understanding)\nand Islamic history. This denotes an approach that is based on legal maxims and their\napplications. The history of economic thought and application of its principles is important\nto differentiate between what is general and what is specific to a particular time and place.\nSaleem (2010) writes that methodologies of fiqh and economics are different because the\nformer deals with individuals while the latter deals with collectives. Also, the former is\nnormative in nature, while the latter is descriptive. Thus, the approaches to studying fiqh\nIJIF\n12,1\n120\n', 'and economics are different. Fiqh is concerned with arriving at legal rulings by studying the\nsources of Islamic law and through other supportive methods of legal reasoning, such as\nanalogy, juristic preference and public benefit. Economics, on the other hand, is concerned\nwith describing the economic behaviour of groups of people and how to deal with scarcity\nand other economic problems while using the modern tools of analysis such as statistics and\neconometrics (Saleem, 2010). Hence, Saleem (2010) clearly differentiates fiqh and Islamic\neconomics as two distinct disciplines with different methods of research and analysis.\nHowever, in the forthcoming section of this paper, we argue for the integration of\nknowledge, which should lead to a better understanding of various phenomena of human\nlife, including that of economics.\nWhen it comes to Islamic finance, especially at the product development stage, one\nshould look into the methodology of applying Sharīʿah requirements. There are two\napproaches to product development in Islamic finance. The first is a Sharīʿah-based\napproach, which means that Sharīʿah rules and requirements are applied from the very start\nof the product development process and are always present throughout the process until the\nproduct roll-out stage. The second is the Sharīʿah compliance approach, which is what most\nIslamic financial institutions currently practice. Choudhury (2014, p. 12) argues that\nSharīʿah compliance as a type of “Muslim intellection in the emergent discipline of Islamic\nfinance [. . .] has resulted merely in imitating modelling of mainstream arguments.” This\napproach basically entails finding an existing conventional finance product, unbundling it\nto its elements, getting rid of forbidden elements and re-packaging it under a traditional\nIslamic contract. Among the problems identified by Sheikhah (2015) with regard to the\nsecond approach is that by mimicking conventional financial products sometimes “the\ndevelopers fail to recognize the risk exposure of the product”. Also, many product\ndevelopers are not familiar with the Sharīʿah requirements and rules. Choudhury (2018)\nstrongly argues that current Islamic economics (and by extension finance) does not have its\nown theory, relying instead on a borrowed mainstream worldview, whereby Islamic ethics\nandmorals are not woven into the methods andmodels of Islamic economics. He also argues\nthat “Islamic finance is not epistemologically different or revolutionary in nature”\n(Choudhury, 2018).\nThis problem is also recognized by Mirakhor and Smolo (2011, pp. 48-53) who assert that\nthe nature of Islamic finance products, which are mainly low-risk, short-term and liquid, is\nbecause of the misunderstanding of the Qur’\x01anic epistemology with regard to muʿ\x01amal\x01at\n(transactions). According to the authors, the Holy Qur’\x01an, with reference to business\ntransactions, as evident in verse 275 Surah Al-Baqara, ordains two things: the first is the use\nof exchange contracts, and the second is the prohibition of rib\x01a (usury). Mirakhor and Smolo\n(2011) assert that the current Islamic financial system is more focused on eliminating rib\x01a\nwithout really using the full spectrum of the Islamic exchange contracts, which encourage\nrisk-spreading and risk-sharing. Ahmed (2014, pp. 18-19) also concurs with the previous\nauthors, stating:\nThe main focus of Islamic financial industry has been to provide Sharīʿah-compliant structures of\nconventional financial products [. . .]. The technology and institutional arrangements allow the\nuse [of] financial/legal engineering to develop Islamic products that replicate conventional\nfinancial products at low costs [. . .]. From an economic perspective, the objective of Islamic banks\nis to structure products that have similar risk-return features of conventional products. From a\nlegal perspective, this is done by using several legitimate Islamic contracts to produce outcomes\nthat replicate conventional products. Doing so, however, can sometimes result in products that are\nSharīʿah compliant in form but not in substance.\nMethodology\nof integrated\nknowledge\n121\n', 'Ahmed (2014) is of the opinion that Islamic financial institutions, depending on the country\nthey operate, are restricted in terms of breadth and scope of financial products that they can\noffer. Such restrictions originate either from external or internal sources. The former\nincludes laws and regulations of a particular country, and the latter includes economic\nmotives that may outweigh the Sharīʿah considerations.\nWhat is more important, however, is to recognize the complexity of economics and\nfinance within the larger social fabric; to move away from conventional thinking and\nmethodology and use instead a systems approach to analyse social phenomena, including\nthose of economics and finance. This would require a deeper understanding of maq\x01a\x01sid alSharīʿah\n(intents and purposes of the Sharīʿah) and of a systems approach based on the\nintegration of knowledge.\nIntegration of knowledge: combining the revealed and the existential sciences\nAccording to Al-Alwani (2005, p. 30), Allah commands humanity to undertake “two\ndifferent kinds of readings and to understand its situation in the universe by understanding\nhow the two readings complement one another”. The two readings that Al-Alwani refers to\nare of the Book of Allah for religious guidance and the book of existence, which is the\ncreated universe. Only this kind of understanding, which takes into consideration the two\nsources of knowledge, can be considered as comprehensive, and it is what is needed to build\nandmaintain a balanced and civilized society (Al-Alwani, 2005).\nDespite the need for various sciences to complement each other, the process of division in\nmodern sciences has proceeded so far that each branch of knowledge has many subbranches.\nFor example, a quick glance at Wikipedia’s natural sciences and related pages\nreveal that they are subdivided into astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology and physics;\nbiology then is further subdivided into more than 50 narrow disciplines; chemistry is divided\ninto five main branches and each has its own divisions as well; astronomy is subdivided into\nmore than 30 small specializations. Obviously, these subdivisions are needed to understand\nthe subjects further and deeper. However, as Snow (1961, p. 4) remarked, “Literary\nintellectuals at one pole – at the other scientists, and as the most representative, the physical\nscientists. Between the two is a gulf of mutual incomprehension – sometimes [. . .] hostility\nand dislike [. . .]” In this lecture, Snow described the two scientific communities (humanities\nand natural science) as having “two cultures”, whereby the two are quite distinct and rarely\ncommunicate with each other. He accuses the Industrial Revolution and the education\nsystem, which developed to cater the needs of industry, to be responsible for such deep\ndivisions. In addition, Snow (1961, pp. 30-42) further states that there is even a deeper\ndivision between the scientific community (natural and human sciences) and the productive\nindustry. Although today capitalism has managed to bring much of the natural science\ncommunity into some aspect of the commercial process – to which the sheer variety of\nproducts in the market testifies – knowledge continues to be subdivided. The dangers of such\ndeep specializations are evident in the destructive powers of science that the twentieth\ncentury had witnessed. Malkawi (2014, p. 6) reminds his readers that despite its success in\nproviding for material needs, modernity has brought unprecedented problems and threatens\nthe future of humanity and the earth itself.\nGradually, however, educators and the scientists themselves are beginning to\nunderstand the need for integration of knowledge. Al-Alwani (2005, p. 32) calls the\nintegration of knowledge, especially the revealed and the existential, a necessity that will\nbring balance to the understanding of reality. Although he mostly refers to the Sharīʿah\nsciences and social sciences when writing about integration and Islamization of knowledge,\nthe natural sciences should also be included in this process for these sciences possess great\nIJIF\n12,1\n122\n', 'powers to either harm humanity or bring benefit. Hence, it is necessary for Muslim scientific\ncommunities, in both theory and applications, to strive for a broader understanding of\nvarious sciences and the revealed knowledge to propel humanity towards the future of\nopenness to new ideas guided by the light of the Qur’\x01an and Sunnah.\nAuda (2010) also advocates the need to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to\nmethodology. He writes (p. 249):\n[. . .] “disciplinisation” should not be an obstacle in the way of using relevant concepts from\n“different” fields in research endeavours. Nor should it be a way of monopolising sources of\nreference in any discipline in order to restrain creativity and control new ideas. In terms of\ndeveloping the discipline of the theory/fundamentals of Islamic law, it is necessary to be open to\nrelevant ideas from other disciplines.\nThe call for the integration of knowledge comes from the idea of the unity of knowledge. All\nknowledge comes from and is caused by the One God. Therefore, there is no distinction in\nIslam between religion and science, because all true knowledge points to the same source –\nthe All-Knowing God (Al-ʿAlīm). Consequently, acquisition of knowledge is considered an\nobligation on society. According to a \x01hadīth reported by Ibn M\x01ajah (2020), Prophet\nMu \x01hammad (SAW) is reported to have said “Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every\nMuslim” (vol. 1, p. 84, no. 224). The \x01hadīth does not differentiate between various kinds of\nknowledge. However, the scholars classified a certain minimal level of religious knowledge\nas a personal obligation while the pursuit of knowledge in science and technology was\nclassified as a societal obligation (Bakar, 2010). This means that Muslims, in general, must\npursue knowledge, which is beneficial on individual and social levels. However, such\nknowledge acquisition must be based on a sound methodological foundation, where tawhīd\nand unity of knowledge play the central role (Choudhury, 2014, 2018).\nTaking into consideration the above discussion, the paper presents a methodology that is\nbased on the idea of collective ijtih\x01ad. Al-Alwani is sceptical that individual ijtih\x01ad is\npossible today because no one can ever master all the sciences. Instead, he proposes policies\nand solutions to be offered by groups of scientists representing various fields.\nProposed methodology of integrated knowledge in Islamic economics and\nfinance\nMethodology establishes rules of subsequent research and development on academic and\npractical levels. It lays out the logic behind the processes and approaches to theory building\nand policy prescriptions. Subsequently, with further research, the methodology and theories\nmay be either confirmed or refuted.\nThere is a methodological dualism whereby theory and practice differ dramatically.\nHence, the mindset of Islamic economics and finance practitioners is the major challenge to\noperationalizing even the existing Sharīʿah-based approach. This mindset, which is the\nreason for “methodological dualism”, creates a disconnect from the real economy,\ninconsistency in issuing fatwas (legal opinions) and lack of understanding about how other\ndisciplines and the environment affect the Islamic economics and finance industry.\nTherefore, the current Islamic economics and finance methodology lacks flexibility.\nBased on the discussion above, it is safe to conclude that the modern methodology of\nIslamic economics and finance lacks rigour and depth and is prone to crises. This paper,\ntherefore, proposes a collaborative methodology that calls for wider collaboration between\nSharīʿah scholars, scholars in human sciences, the information and communication\ntechnologies and natural sciences, which would constitute the collective ijtih\x01ad. However,\nbefore any further discussion on the proposed methodology, it is important to demonstrate\nMethodology\nof integrated\nknowledge\n123\n', 'that the idea of collective ijtih\x01ad is not new. Hasan (2020) suggests that this form of ijtih\x01ad\nhas been in existence for a very long time, and many scholars have promoted this idea. For\nexample, he mentions consultation (shūr\x01a) of the Prophet’s companions (peace be upon\nthem) in deducing rulings while the Prophet (SAW) was among them (p. 29). After the\nProphet’s (SAW) death, such ijtih\x01ad continued during the leadership of the rightly guided\ncaliphs and slowly diminished in importance, giving rise to what is known as taqlīd\n(imitation), which “seriously disrupted the natural growth of fiqh and arrested the\nefflorescence of ijtih\x01ad” (Kamali, 2006, p. 33). Hasan (2020, pp. 30-31) argues that collective\nijtih\x01ad grew again during the Tanzimat period of the Ottoman Empire and resulted in the\nproduction of the highly praised “Islamic civil code” (The Majallah), written by a sevenmember\ncommittee chaired by Cevdet Pasha. The Muslim reformer Muhammad Rashid\nRida (d. 1935) also advanced the idea of collective ijtih\x01ad (Hasan, 2020, p. 32). Kamali (2006,\np. 163) writes that the theory of ijtih\x01ad needs revision and reformation; it should recognize\nthe validity of collective ijtih\x01ad and that “experts in other fields such as science, economics\nand medicine” should also be allowed to contribute “if they are equipped with adequate\nknowledge of the source evidence of Sharīʿah”. Auda (2010, pp. 193-195) concurs with the\nauthors above and opines, when writing about consensus, that it is “a mechanism of\nconsultation or, to use systems terminology, multiple-participant decision making” and that\nit could be used to make “collective fatwa”. Hence, collective ijtih\x01ad is a necessary tool for\nbetter decision-making, especially in areas ofmuʿ\x01amal\x01at (transactions). The following is the\nproposed methodology that could be used to better understand economic and financial\nissues of societies and come up with human and environmentally friendly solutions\n(Figure 1).\nThe above-proposed methodology consists of three sections. The first section represents\nthe ultimate objective of Sharīʿah in human transactions – well-being and happiness.\nAccording to Ibn Ashur (2006, p. 221):\n[. . .] the main objective of Sharīʿah is to establish a strong community with stable social system\nand promote the orderly functioning of its affairs by achieving its welfare and preventing evil.\nFigure 1.\nThe proposed\nmethodology\nAuxiliary\nGuiding Principles\n“Small is beautiful” – “Via Negativa” – “Trial & Error” –\n“Optionality” – “Cooperation”\nMain1 2\n3 4\nFiqh & Usul Al-Fiqh\nMaqasid Al-Shari’ah\nEconomic, behavioural,\nsocietal, medical & historical\nresearch (quantitative &\nqualitative)\nBiology – Chemistry –\nPhysics – Geology\nSoftware\nHardware\nArtificial intelligence\nShari’ah\nSciences\nHuman\nSciences\nNatural\nSciences ICT\nMain Objective:\nPromotion of wellbeing\nand happiness \n(falah & sa’adah)\nAcademic & Industry\nOutput:\nFinancial Solutions\nPolicy Prescriptions\nArticles\nBooks\nSeminars\nConferences\nCollaborative Studies\nSource: Rafikov (2019, p. 256)\nIJIF\n12,1\n124\n', 'We argue, therefore, that well-being and happiness constitute the main objective of Sharīʿah\nbecause they are the end result of a strong community that looks after the welfare of its\nmembers and prevents evil. Their inclusion in the creative process will ensure that the final\noutput is friendly to human beings, rather than organization-centric. Abdullah and Wan\nMansor (2016, p. 326) argue in favour of happiness/well-being being counted as one of the\nhigher objectives (maq\x01a\x01sid al-ʿ\x01aliyyah) of Sharīʿah because it is “deeply embedded in the\nprimary sources – the Qur’an and hadith”. Addas (2008, p. 123) also concludes that\n“the principal end of Islamic economics is to develop a society that has an economic order\ncapable of achieving fal\x01a \x01h”. Hence, fal\x01a \x01h (salvation, success) and saʿ\x01adah (happiness, wellbeing),\napart from the worldview of the researcher, should always have a bearing on\nmethodology.\nThe second section (the centre with four quadrants) is the actual research and\ndevelopment (R&D) involving collaboration of the various sciences, with Sharīʿah being the\nfoundational science. The collaborative methodology calls for either the cooperation of\nresearchers/practitioners from various fields or a single researcher studying one particular\nissue from different perspectives, particularly from the perspectives of the Sharīʿah and\nbehavioural sciences (psychology, sociology, political science and history). This approach,\nalthough difficult for the modern mono-disciplinary culture of scholarship, is not impossible,\nand there is plenty of evidence that the academic world moves towards multi-, inter- and\ntrans-disciplinary studies. In addition, collaboration and cooperation with the aim to find\nacceptable solutions is in line with the Qur’\x01anic order to “cooperate in righteousness and\npiety” (Qur’\x01an, 5:2). Therefore, we argue that the promotion of well-being and happiness at\nsocial and individual levels is the main objective of the Islamic way of life.\nIt should be noted, however, that these sciences all have their own methods of research,\nso it is necessary to recognize the complexity of this approach. Even so, by following the\nidea of “integrated knowledge”, their base would be the same – taw \x01hīd and the sciences of\nthe Sharīʿah (fiqh and u\x01sūl al-fiqh). In other words, researchers having similar worldviews\nand accepting the idea of taw \x01hīd, but using different methodologies in their respective\nsciences, can uncover new solutions to existing or arising economic/financial problems in a\ngiven society. Therefore, this paper does not introduce a new methodology but promotes\ncooperation among different sciences with their respective methodologies to research and\ndevelop solutions to current economic and financial problems on the basis of mutual respect\nand understanding.\nSocial sciences, among which are economics, psychology, sociology, history and even\nmedical sciences, are needed to provide a comprehensive outlook into the human dimension\nof a problem. Specifically, behavioural and social studies provide insights into behaviour at\npersonal and societal levels. History studies patterns and extracts lessons from the change,\ngrowth and fall of civilizations, empires, countries, cities, ideologies, companies and\nindividuals. History could also provide insights into the details of events, institutions,\npersons, innovations and so on. Its usefulness is in the fact that history tends to repeat itself.\nSometimes, medical sciences may be referred to assess the health effects of a particular\nsolution on a segment of the population.\nNatural sciences may be necessary to provide additional support during the R&D\nprocess. Environmental concerns, such as climate change, pollution and human migration,\nshould also be taken into consideration when designing policies that affect the natural\nhabitat. Information and communication technologies also play a supporting role, which is\nvery important nowadays: the provision of software and hardware to get things done.\nModern analysis of complex data necessitates special programs and personnel trained to\nwork with large amounts of information. Hence, natural sciences may play either the main\nMethodology\nof integrated\nknowledge\n125\n', 'or auxiliary role in the final output – the third layer. The final output is what the\nstakeholders will produce in the form of policies, financial products, academic writings,\nresearch papers or educational programs.\nThe end result of this proposed methodology is for the use of government agencies\ninvolved in economic policymaking or institutions providing financial services, enabling\nthem to assess their current or planned activities with regard to long-term environmental\neffects. To do this, they would have to have some input from independent scientists involved\nin environmental studies. Unfortunately, modern entities, especially those involved in\neconomic/financial activities, tend to focus on short-term goals, and so environmental or\nhealth concerns are often left out. Likewise, academicians, students and other researchers\ncan benefit from this methodology by studying important issues from multiple perspectives\nand using an interdisciplinary approach. This does not deny any of the existing\nmethodologies as long as they conform to the main objective of the Sharīʿah mentioned\nabove and the guiding principles explained next.\nFurthermore, the collaborative methodology that this paper calls for should have some\nguiding principles that help design solutions that are human-friendly rather than\norganization-centric. We, therefore, propose the adoption of what Taleb (2014) calls\n“antifragility”. Taleb (2014, pp. 3-4) writes:\nSome things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness,\ndisorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk and uncertainty [. . .]. Antifragility is beyond\nresilience and robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets\nbetter. This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas,\nrevolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate\nsurvival, good recipes [. . .], the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial\nresistance [. . .] even our own existence as a species on this planet.\nThis effectively means that solutions to human problems, including economic and financial,\nshould have anti-fragile qualities of complex systems that have survived. Hence, a certain\namount of stressors is not only welcome in our daily lives but is absolutely necessary; for\nexample, stressors that do not destroy but help develop, such as exercise or fasting. The\nanti-fragile guiding principles that we propose for the collaborative methodology include the\nideas of simplicity, subtraction, optionality and trial and error. By focusing on simplicity,\nwe recognize the limitations of human capacity to build complex systems. To minimize the\npossibility of “black swan” rare events, simpler solutions tend to be robust. For example,\nnuclear power stations have the capability to produce enough electricity for large areas.\nHowever, the history of meltdowns in Chernobyl and Fukushima, as well as nuclear waste,\nshows the danger of such complex power plants. Instead, sustainable electricity production by\na large number of households and buildings may be the future of electricity. Likewise, financial\nderivatives are very complex, and they are known to contribute to economic fragility.\nSubtraction or via negativa means that to find a solution, often it is not necessary to\ncreate more and more layers of additional solutions to simple problems. For example,\nmodern medicine is based on fighting symptoms through chemical substances. Usually,\nmedical drugs have side effects, often severe. However, humankind survived for millennia\nby using simple methods, such as herbs, dietary restrictions, ample exercise and rest.\nEconomic and financial problems can also be tackled through this mechanism whereby\nsimpler solutions may be more effective than complex ones.\nOptionality and trial and error mean that a great number of social problems and\nchallenges may have to be met with many options as well as constant tinkering to find the\nbest solution. This principle recognizes diversity and change, and that a solution that\nworked at one time and place may not be applicable in another situation. Hence, the variety\nIJIF\n12,1\n126\n', 'of options to the existing problems has a higher chance of producing “anti-fragile” solutions.\nFor example, financing of a small business or a small farm does not have to be based on the\ndebt alone. Equity and grants from many sources could produce better results and may\nactually help grow entrepreneurship and innovation.\nThe guiding principles introduced in this paper seek to counter the era of gigantism that\nwas the feature of the twentieth century. Megaprojects are often necessary for economies,\nspurring economic activities in and around the projects. However, they can be damaging to\nthe environment because of deforestation, pollution, displacement of local populations\n(humans, animals, birds and insects), etc.\nNevertheless, the proposed methodology calls for the collective ijtih\x01ad of scholars and\npractitioners from various fields/sciences. It is also possible to draw a parallel with Fritz\nMachlup’s “Map of Territory”mentioned earlier and see that methodology and its understanding\nmust encompass various philosophical and metaphysical approaches. Only this approach will\nensure a less uncertain future for the coming generations as solutions would have to be built\naround the ideas of tawhīd, well-being and multidisciplinary methodology. The policies and\nsolutionswould thus be human- and environment friendly and not organization-centric.\nConclusion\nThe paper addressed the issue of methodology from the Islamic perspective. Both theoretical\nand applied sciences stem from some fundamental approach that defines their development.\nOne may attribute the tremendous growth of science in the past two centuries to its\nincreasingly empirical nature and point to positive methodology as being responsible for such\ngrowth. However, we also see the negative results of scientific development in terms of the\nmassive loss of lives in the twentieth century, continuing environmental degradation and\npollution, growing economic inequality around the world and many social and economic issues\nglobally. As mentioned in the paper, there is a methodology problem, especially in economics\nand finance, whereby logical positivism – also known as empiricism and even social\nDarwinism – has effectively created themodern consumer society and all its social ills.\nIslamic methodology, on the other hand, is based on the Qur’\x01anic value system and the\ntaw \x01hīdī epistemology, which emphasize Divine Law as their main component. Integration of\nknowledge, also known as Islamization of knowledge, as promoted by the IIIT, is amethodology\nthat combines the revealed and the existential sciences. The main purpose of the integration of\nknowledge is to effect change in how humans interact in search of truth because truth can only\nbe attained with divine guidance and an interdisciplinary approach to theoretical and applied\nsciences. In economics and finance, the methodology of integrated knowledge aims to produce\npolicy prescriptions and financial solutions that are human-friendly and not organizationcentric.\nHence, the paper, following the ideas of Al-Alwani (2005), calls for collective ijtih\x01ad\nwhich should be performed by various centres of learning and research, as well as government\nand private agencies that have the ability to influence policy. Lastly, the paper calls for further\nresearch in the area of methodology from themulti- or inter-disciplinary perspective.\nReferences\nAbdullah, A.B. and Wan Mansor, W.N.
