Bohlmann and Gina Petrovici\nEuropean Space Agency, Paris, France\nNon-technical abstract\nSixty years of space activities have led to ongoing scientific and technological progress. Space\n4.0 reflects the rapid changes of the space community. Growing interest in space activities\nleads to increasing participation of numerous new actors in this field. Governments, private\nactors and international organizations are eager to fill existing gaps in securing global society’s\nneeds. The European Space Agency’s Space 4.0 concept is designed to host a new era of space\nactivities, aiming to resolve global challenges and to serve society. Space 4.0 developments are\nhighly important, but are taking place in an extremely complex net of legal, regulatory and\npolitical considerations. This paper focuses on the legal challenges raised by the new era of\nSpace 4.0 in a sustainability context.\nTechnical abstract\nThis paper spotlights the legal challenges related to the current age of space activities. After a\ncursory overview of the evolution of space activities in the different preceding eras, it provides\nsome insight into the manifold interactions between the current era of Industry 4.0 and space\nactivities in general. The following section gives an overview of the general legal norms applicable\nto space activities, mainly the five UN Treaties governing the activities of States in the\nexploration and use of outer space as adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. A\ncore section then deals with legal challenges in the era of Space 4.0 relating specifically to\nenvironmental considerations in that era, which merit particular attention, namely the\nspace debris issues. While taking the classical UN Outer Space Treaty system as a starting\npoint, the legal appreciation of the environmental impact of space activities will be discussed\nin the light of the developing international environmental law context, including the direct\nrelevance of general environmental law and policy. A concluding section provides some\nconsiderations concerning possible future developments.\nSocial media summary\nSpace 4.0 reflects the rapid changes in the space community. This paper spotlights the legal\nchallenges related to the current space era.\n1. Space 4.0\nSpace 4.0 is leaving its hallmark on what appears to be a new era of space activities. In 2016 at\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) Council meeting at Ministerial Level in Lucerne,i the landmark\nresolution ‘Towards Space 4.0 for a United Space in Europe’ was adopted. This reso-\nlution outlines the two guiding visions of the ESA: ‘United Space in Europe’ and ‘Space\n4.0’. The latter will be elaborated hereafter in more detail, with both objectives aiming for common\ngoals among ESA´s Member States and to ensure the ongoing success of European space\nactivities for the benefit of society and industry in the new space era.\n1.1. The space eras\n‘Space 4.0’ builds upon the achievements and developments of three previous chapters of\nexploration and use of space:\n• Space 1.0 started before the first satellites were launched into outer space, at a time when\nastronomers discovered the first shapes of celestial bodies, their movement and mechanics.ii\nThe first practical uses of space are reflected by navigation in this period, which was guided\nfrom the lights of celestial bodies shining from outer space in the sky.\n• Space 2.0 was driven by the political rivalry of the Cold War era, leading to high levels of\ninvestments aiming at technological superiority to ensure national security and prestige.iii\nThe space race influenced by those Cold War motives led finally to the Apollo era and\n', 'provided the basis of negotiations for a legal framework for\nouter space activities due to the increasing importance of\nspace activities.\n• Space 3.0 was characterised by international cooperation efforts.\nThe flagship project of this space era is the International Space\nStation (ISS) – the greatest common international research project\nof all time, in which the major space-faring nations and\nregions – the USA, Russia, Japan, Canada and Europe – are\njointly investing in one project.\nSpace 4.0 now marks the next chapter in the revolution of space\nactivities. The most important maxim in the current space era\nis participation, characterized by a growing number of space\nactors ranging from governments to private investors. The development\nof small satellites and the technical advancements result-\ning from Industry 4.0 have enabled more nations to become active\nin space activities. These technologies allow cheaper and faster\naccess to space, even for smaller nations and developing countries.\nFurther, the number of private investors, scientific institutions\nand universities focusing on this area is continuously growing.\nGovernments may also cooperate with private investors (e.g., in\npublic–private partnerships). In such cases, traditional government\ncontracts are supplemented by new business models.\nSpace 4.0 represents the evolution of the traditionally state-driven\nspace activities into an era of privatization and commercialization\nof space activities, mirrored by collaboration between governments,\nthe private sector, society and politics. Space 4.0 leads to\nincreasing international cooperation in various fields. ESA\nDirector General Jan-Dietrich Wörner stated, “Sustainable development\nis an issue that concerns us all, and towards which we can\nall contribute […] ESA has been fostering sustainable development\non Earth for years, and we strongly intend to further sup-\nport this via our programmes, data and services.”iv These\nongoing commitments are reflected, among others, in the\n‘Clean Space Initiative’ and the launch of its catalogue of\n‘Activities Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals’.v The\ninternational State community acknowledged in the context of\nUNISPACE + 50 and the preparation of the Space 2030 agenda\nthe need to join forces to ensure the long-term sustainable and\npeaceful use of outer space. During the recent UN/Germany\nHigh Level Forum ‘The way forward after UNISPACE + 50 and\non Space 2030’ at the UNSPIDER campus in Bonn, Germany,\nmore than 300 high-level participants gathered to exchange information\nand to build new partnerships in order to foster sustain-\nable development on Earth and in outer space. The event served\nas an important platform for providing recommendations addressing\nsustainable development challenges. Non-space actors\nreceived detailed information on how space applications and\ndata can tackle the challenges of climate change and how they\ncontribute to ensuring sustainable life on Earth. This reflects\nanother goal of Space 4.0: to bring space closer to society and\nto use space for Earth.\n1.2. Space 4.0 and Industry 4.0\nSpace 4.0 reflects the concept of Industry 4.0 and has been defined\nin an analogy to the fourth chapter of the evolution of industrial\nprogress, including services as well as manufacturing.vi Industry\n4.0 makes use of contemporary automation, manufacturing technologies,\nbig data and the exchanges thereof. A core element of\nthe current era of industrial revolution is innovation. New business\nconcepts and technological advancements such as smart\nintegrated services and digital technologies revolutionized\nproduction, and design and management mechanisms are taking\nthe place of traditional value chains. Innovation in the space sector\ndoes not exist in isolation from the innovative developments\nin other fields of society. The space sector, as one industrial sector,\nis rather closely linked to the pioneering dynamics of Industry\n4.0. The space sector has become increasingly relevant for industry\nand society as it makes use of interconnections with other\ntechnology fields and innovative mechanisms for improved spacecraft\nmanufacturing and advanced general-use technologies for\nspace missions. Artificial intelligence and 3D printing are two\nexamples that currently find their use on board the\nInternational Space Station (ISS). On 6 June 2018, the Crew\nInteractive Mobile Companion (CIMON)vii – the world’s first flying,\nautonomous astronaut assistant featuring artificial intelli-\ngence – was launched together with ESA astronaut Alexander\nGerst to the ISS. Not only is a 3D printer installed on the ISS,\nwhere it is used for scientific experiment, but ESA has also considered\nusing 3D printing technologyviii in the frame of the\nMoon Village.ix Space 4.0 as a new concept building on\nIndustry 4.0 is designed to host a new era of space activities, setting\nout to tackle global challenges using the advantages deriving\nfrom space and technological progress. In a reciprocal use,\nIndustry 4.0 benefits strongly from various features of space activities,\nranging from system approaches, connectivity, extreme reli-\nability and remote operations in harsh environments. The\nconceptual analogy and combination of Industry 4.0 and Space\n4.0 have clear advantages for numerous industrial sectors, citizens,\ngovernments and society. It mutually allows for a trend towards\nadvancements and growing integration of space technologies for\nthe benefit of society.\n1.3. ESA and Space 4.0i\nTo elucidate its own role in this new era, the ESA has implemented\nits own motto of Space 4.0i, identifying its main lines of action\nbased on the mandate given to it by its Member States in its\nfounding instrument, the Convention for the Establishment of a\nEuropean Space Agency.x This leitmotif of Space 4.0i embodies\nthe vision of ESA as the space agency for Europe that constantly\ninnovates, inspires, informs and interacts for the benefit of the\nEuropean citizen, society and economy.\n1.3.1. Information\nThe exchange of scientific and technical information in the fields\nof space research and technology is rooted in Article III of the\nESA Convention. The ESA disseminates the value and knowledge\ngenerated by space activities, ensuring the availability of data for\ntheir use by potential stakeholders and shareholders, such as\ndecision-makers in various sectorial areas and at all levels in\nStates. As a reaction to the development of data regarding ‘the\ngold from Space’,xi ESA has taken the decision to implement an\nopen access policy for its information and data. While it previously\nalready shared large amounts of space imagery and data\nwith multiple actors in the fields of science, industry, media\nand the public on digital platforms,xii as an outcome of its digital\nagenda, ESA’s free and open data policies are mirrored in its public\nweb pages, providing a wide range of information for the gen-\neral public,xiii specific thematic pages and reports on programmes,\ninformation pages for industry, the organization of or participation\nin conferences or workshopsxiv and blogs written by, for\nexample, the Director General, Johann-Dietrich Wörner, or\nESA astronauts, such as Alexander Gerst.xv\n2 Ulrike M. Bohlmann and Gina Petrovici\n', '1.3.2. Innovation\nThe Agency’s activities are driven by its innovation strategy and\nby the desire for a seamless grid of innovation. Innovation relates\nto technology and processes, to spin-off activities (e.g., the\nTechnology Transfer Programme and its network of brokers),\nspin-in to use on-the-ground innovations and spin-along\nco-development activities. In addition, new funding schemes are\ndeveloped in order to extend the implementation of public–private\npartnerships to foster innovative missions, technologies and\nservices in European industry. Moreover, the ESA uses its longstanding\ntechnical and business development expertise to support\nprivate activities by setting up an ever-expanding network of ESA\nBusiness Incubation Centres all over Europe, which have already\nsupported more than 500 start-ups to turn space-related business\nconcepts into commercial, sustainable and innovation-led\nstart-ups.\n1.3.3. Interaction\nArticle II of the ESAConvention already stipulates the provision for\nand promotion of cooperation among European Member States in\nspace research and technology and their space applications as the\ncentral purpose of the ESA’s activities.xvi The reliability of the\nESA as a partner is extensively recognized internationally: the\nESA interacts with international partners, third States and international\norganizations as a promoter or enabler of international\nprojects. A special advantage of the ESA as an international partner\nis its special nature as an intergovernmental organization and\nits global position, allowing it to build bridges between partners\nwith diverging political or economic systems. The ESA interacts\nand cooperates with industry, both the ‘traditional’ space industry\nas well as non-space industry. Based on close collaboration with\nits Member States, the ESA supports the interaction between\nindustry and European academia to further encourage innovation\nand sustainability in the European space industry – intending to\nobtain maximum benefits from space activities for the benefit of\nEuropean citizens. The interaction with academia also aims to foster\na skilled and trained workforce, contributing to the European\nknowledge base and its global competitiveness. The ESA’s\nCitizens’ Debate on Space for Europe is a prime example of its\ninteraction with the general public. The first Citizens’ Debate\nwas organized in the run-up to the last Ministerial Council in\norder to collect the ideas and opinions of European citizens\nfrom different backgrounds to help in the creation of the future\nEuropean space strategy. The day-long event in September 2016\nattracted 2000 persons from 22 States.xvii The results of this direct\ninteraction with European citizens were immediately fed into the\nESA’s strategic debate.\n1.3.4. Inspiration\nSpace has an extremely high potential for inspiration. The ESA’s\nfourth ‘i’ refers to this phenomenon. The sky has fascinated\nhumanity for generations. Artist, poets, navigators and explorers\nwere inspired by what they saw far above them. Starting with\nthe era of Space 1.0, astronomers started to use telescopes to\nexplore the movement of celestial bodies. As a result, space activities\nhave motivated generations of young people and adults to\ndeepen their knowledge of this field and to pursue careers in\nthe space or the STEM sector in general. However, beyond this\ndirect and obvious effect, the ESA aspires to inspire more challenging\nendeavours that are conceived for the long term, such as the\nRosetta mission, the development of which started in the early\n1990s and the trajectory of which had to be modified to\naccommodate a different target comet than originally foreseen.\nThe Rosetta performed an amazing number of manoeuvres during\nits ten-year journey to finally arrive in the orbit of comet\n67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko and put a lander on its surface.\nThis is one of the most beautiful representations of the audacity,\ntenacity and resilience required, as well as the satisfaction of\nfinally reaching a goal after intense effort. The inspiration these\nmissions spark is not limited to space endeavours alone, but\ncan spill over into any discipline.\n2. Space 4.0 and the law\nSpace activities allow significant improvement to the standard of\nliving of humankind. Earth observation satellites provide data that\nare relevant, for example, in the fields of environmental protection,\ndisaster management, forestation and agriculture. Earth\nobservation enables the international community to monitor the\nchallenges of climate change. Outer space activities are significantly\ncontributing to sustaining life on Earth, and the inter-\nnational community is eager to ensure a long-term sustainable\nuse of outer space. In the Horizons mission, the first German\ncommander of the ISS, Alexander Gerst, conducted numerous\nexperiments the results of which are contributing to the following\nUN Sustainable Development Goals: SDG 3: Good Health and\nWell-Being; SDG 4: Quality Education; SDG 7: Affordable and\nClean Energy; SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth;\nSDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; and SDG 13:\nClimate Action.\nThe atmosphere surrounding our home planet plays a decisive\nrole in human well-being, and outer space in that sense is not far\naway. Having said that, it is important, however, to highlight the\ndifference in the legal status of airspace and outer space: as Hobe\nemphasised, “[…] the regulation of the airspacexviii cannot be\ncompared to outer space legislation because airspace is subject\nto the sovereignty and jurisdiction of a subjacent State, the others,\ni.e. the Deep Seabed, High Seas and Antarctica, like outer space,\nare also common areas.”xix At this point, it is worth noting that\nneither airspace nor outer space is defined in the relevant treaties.xx\nThe delimitation of outer space from airspace has been\ndebated since the 1950s and still figures as a permanent Agenda\nItem on the agenda of the Legal Subcommittee of the United\nNations (UN) Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space\n(UNCOPUOS) in 2019.\nThe existing legal framework governing outer space activities\nhas nevertheless been successfully ensuring the peaceful use of\nspace for current and future generations for decades. The corpus\nof law is the result of years and decades of negotiations of the\ninternational community, in which the world has seen the emergence\nof new rules and the codification of fundamental legal prin-\nciples regulating the peaceful exploration and use of outer space\nfor all humankind. On an international level, a range of multilateral\ntreaties was concluded within the UN, UN General Assembly\nResolutions were negotiated and numerous bilateral arrangements\nand guidelines by international organizations elaborated. The\ncorpus iuris spatialis has developed as an increasingly relevant\nsegregated corpus of law within general public international law.\n2.1. General overview of the public international law governing\nthe exploration and use of outer space\nThe main five multilateral treaties – drafted and concluded in the\n‘Cold War’ eraxxi – within the UNCOPUOSxxii are:\nGlobal Sustainability 3\n', '○ 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in\nthe Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon\nand other Celestial Bodies [Outer Space Treaty, or OST]xxiii;\n○ 1968 Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of\nAstronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer\nSpace [Rescue and Return Agreement]xxiv;\n○ 1972 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused\nby Space Objects [Liability Convention]xxv;\n○ 1975 Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into\nOuter Space [Registration Convention]xxvi; and\n○ 1979 Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the\nMoon and other Celestial Bodies [Moon Agreement].xxvii\nThe OST is the magna carta of outer space activities and sets out\nthe general legal principle applicable to space activities, which are\nfurther deepened in the subsequent four multilateral treaties.\nThese activities include: the non-appropriation of outer space\nby any one State; the freedom of the use and exploration of\nouter space; a liability regime applicable in the case of damage\ncaused by space objects; the safety and rescue of space objects\nand astronauts; the notification and registration of space activities\nwith the UN; the scientific investigation and exploitation of the\nnatural resources of outer space; and the settlement of disputes\narising from outer space activities.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned treaties, the UN General\nAssembly adopted five sets of principles applicable to the exploration\nand use of outer space:\n○ 1963 Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities\nof States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Spacexxviii;\n○ 1982 Principles Governing the Use by States of Artificial Earth\nSatellites for International Direct Television Broadcastingxxix;\n○ 1986 Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from\nOuter Spacexxx;\n○ 1992 Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources\nin Outer Spacexxxi; and\n○ 1996 Declaration on International Cooperation in the\nExploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in\nthe Interest of All States, Taking into Particular Account the\nNeeds of Developing Countries.xxxii\nHowever, it is worth noting that Resolutions of the General\nAssembly are considered ‘soft law’ and as such have a non-legally\nbinding character in the sense of Article 38(1) of the Statute of the\nInternational Court of Justice.xxxiii Nevertheless, some of the provisions\nmay have reached customary law status.xxxiv This must be\nproven on a case-by-case basis.\n2.2. Legal challenges in the era of Space 4.0: considerations on\nsustainability\nThe developments of Space 4.0 as described above reflect the\nchanges in the space community. As the world continues to\nface a growing need for dedicated space applications, with challenges\nranging from climate change to shortages of resources,\nhealth, demographic development, the digital divide and more,\nrevolutionary space applications – such as small satellites and\nmega-constellations – bring space closer to society and inspire\nnew generations. However, these new tools also comprise legal\nuncertainties and challenges. One reason for this is that these\ndevelopments are taking place in a highly complex environment\nof legal, regulatory and political considerations, which are themselves\nraising challenges.\n2.2.1. Starting from treaty law\nSpace activities enable humankind to reach further and to use the\nbenefits of space applications and data for their lives on Earth.\nNevertheless, it is a reality that the exploration and use of outer\nspace by their nature involve elements that can be inherently\nthreatening to the environment on Earth and in outer space.\nDue to the increasing relevance of space activities for society\nand industry and the growing number of space actors and missions,\nthe sustainability of these activities and also their environ-\nmental impacts have begun to be addressed. Since the corpus iuris\nspatialis depicted above was developed as a result of negotiations\nbeginning in the Cold War era of Space 2.0, they do not provide a\ncomprehensive legal framework for the sustainable and environmentally\nprotective exploration and use of outer space and in par-\nticular not with a view to the currently exploding numbers of\nsatellites and actors. The traditional legal framework for outer\nspace activities does not contain specific environmental standards,\nas it was developed well ahead of the codification of environmental\nlaw. Rather, environmental protection was considered – if\nthought was given at all – as a hindrance to the emerging space\nactivities at that time.xxxv\nNevertheless, the traditional space law instruments have laid\ndown a starting point: sedes materiae in the OST concerning\nthe protection of the environment is Article IX,xxxvi and more specifically\nits second sentence, which stipulates primarily back and\nforward contamination as it includes the obligation to conduct\nexploration of outer space, including the moon and other celestial\nbodies “so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also\nadverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from\nthe introduction of extraterrestrial matter […].” It is interesting\nto note in this context that only in the case of a State Party having\nreason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by it or its\nnationals would cause potential harmful interference with activities\nof other States Parties should the State Party concerned\nshall undertake appropriate international consultation before proceeding\nwith any such activity or experiment. This is not foreseen\nfor the ‘mere’ harmful contamination of the outer space environment\nor the adverse changes in the environment of the Earth. The\nenvironmental integrity of outer space as such is not at the heart\nof this provision.\nThe same Earth-centric perspective can be found in the\nLiability Convention, which establishes a system of absolute liability\n(Article II) to be applied in case of damage caused by a space\nobject on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight, and of\nfault-based liability (Article III) if the damage is caused elsewhere\nthan on the surface of the Earth to a space object or to persons or\nproperty on board such a space object of another launching State.\nArticle I(a) defines damage as meaning “loss of life, personal\ninjury or other impairment of health; or loss of or damage to property\nof States or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of inter-\nnational intergovernmental organisations.” This can also comprise\nenvironmental damage. However, the Liability Convention does\nnot address any kind of environmental damage outside the surface\nof the Earth.\nOther norms of the UN space treaties – such as Article 7 of the\nMoon Agreement – refer to the environmental considerations\nrelated to the exploitation of natural resources in outer space,\nthe so-called in situ resource utilization, which is a promising subject\nin Space 4.0 in relation to additive manufacturing (i.e., 3D\n4 Ulrike M. Bohlmann and Gina Petrovici\n', 'printing). Since the Moon Agreement was negotiated at a time\nwhen environmental considerations had become a global concern,\nit elaborates more on the principles regarding the protection of\nthe outer space environment. There is another novelty with regard\nto the principles of international environmental law and space law\nto be found in the Moon Agreement: the concept of intergenerational\nequity makes its first outer space-specific appearance only\nin Article 7.1 of the Moon Agreement, even though reflections\non the concept can historically be found in a number of different\ncultural circles all around the globe.xxxvii It is, however, worth noting\nthat the Moon Agreement so far has only gathered 18 State\nParties – compared to 107 State Parties for the OST, among\nwhich all major space-faring nations can be found.xxxviii\n2.2.2. Taking on broader perspectives in international\nenvironmental law\nArticle III of the OST reaffirms that States Parties to the Treaty\nshall carry on activities in the exploration and use of outer\nspace in accordance with international law – which, of course,\nincludes international environmental law. The first significant\nlegal statement of fundamental international principles for the\nprotection of the environmentxxxix is embodied by the 1972\nStockholm Declaration.xl According to Principle 21 of the\nStockholm Declaration, States have, in accordance with the\nCharter of the UN and the principles of international law,\n“[…] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction\nor control do not cause damage to the environment of\nother States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.”\nSince outer space is one of the areas beyond the limits of national\njurisdiction, it is directly protected by this principle. The UN\nGeneral Assembly Resolution 2996 (XXVII) 1972 asserts that\nPrinciple 21 (and 22) of the Stockholm Declaration “lay down\nthe basic rules governing the matter.” The principle is further\nrepeated by Principle 2 of the Declaration of the UN\nConference on Environment and Development, adopted in Rio\nde Janeiro in 1992, and Article 3 of the 1992 Convention on\nBiological Diversity. This maxim was further affirmed by the\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Advisory Opinion on\nthe Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weaponsxli:\n[…] the existence of the general obligation of States to ensure that activities\nwithin their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other\nstates or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of\ninternational law relating to the environment.\nThe precautionary principle is further developed by Principle 15\nof the Rio Declaration:\nTo protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely\napplied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats\nof serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall\nnot be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent\nenvironmental degradation. Accordingly, if there is sufficient scientific\nevidence to establish the possibility of a risk of serious harm, States cannot\njustify their lack of action with the absence of a proof of harm.\nGiven the current lack of readiness of States to commit to\ninternationally binding hard law, internationally agreed standards\nare increasingly important instruments for the international community\nto provide legal guidance in the further development and\nimplementation of the applicable law, including the law applicable\nto space activities. Two examples are the COSPAR Planetary\nProtection Policyxlii and the UN Space Debris Mitigation\nGuidelines.xliii The latter will be elaborated upon in more detail\nin the following subsections.\n2.2.3. Soft law: guidelines, principles and policies\nIn addition to the Treaty provisions, the international State community\ndeveloped sets of principles that are particularly directed\ntowards specific environmental concerns – such as the use of\nnuclear power sources in outer spacexliv and space debris.xlv\nThese principles have soft law character and are as such not\nlegally binding upon the international community. However,\nthey might have politically binding character and provide guidance\nin the interpretation of the existing obligations of States:\nsince Article IX of the OST obliges State Parties to conduct\ntheir activities in outer space with due regard to the interests of\nother States and the protection of the global environment,\nStates are further obliged to take appropriate measures to prevent,\nminimize and control the potential environmental harm resulting\nfrom their activities in outer space. Due diligence as a central\nelement requires States to conduct close monitoring and the\ntransposition of new scientific and technological findings\npromptly into rules and policies to ensure the compliance with\nthe international legal standards.\n2.2.4. The example of space debris\nIn more than 60 years of space activities and more than 8593\nlaunches since 1957,xlvi the number of pieces of tracked space debris\nexceeding the size of 10 cm is estimated to be greater than\n22,000. Each year, the amount of space debris capable of endangering\nlife on Earth and beyond (e.g., the lives of astronauts on\nboard the ISSxlvii) and with the ability to threaten operating\nspace objects increases. New space actors, mainly private entities\nsuch as OneWeb and SpaceX, aim to launch hundreds and thousands\nof small satellites into outer space to install mega-\nconstellations that can connect large parts of the globe to the\ninternet. Consequently, these kinds of business models are further\ncontributing to the growing number of space objects in the\nalready crowded low Earth orbit (LEO), providing the issue of\nspace debris with a whole new dimension both from a technical\nand from a legal perspective. This situation severely endangers\nthe long-term sustainability of space activities. Around 42,000\nobjects are currently being tracked in orbit. Some 23,000 of\nthese objects remain in space and are regularly tracked by the\nUS Space Surveillance Network.xlviii Objects larger than about\n5–10 cm within the LEO and 30 cm–1 m in geostationary orbit\nare maintained in a catalogue. Only around 1200 of these objects\nare operational satellites. In general, 24% of the tracked objects are\nsatellites and 18% are upper stages. Since 1961, 290 in-orbit fragmentations\nhave led to an increase in the amount of space debris.\nThe majority was caused by explosions of spacecraft and upper\nstages.xlix The installation of large and mega-constellations of\nsmall satellites and the growing amount of space debris has led\nto the danger of cascade effects, known as Kessler syndromel –\nwhich further underlines the immense risk resulting from debris,\nultimately resulting in a debris belt in LEO. In February 2009, the\nKosmos–Iridium accident took place. It was the first collision of\ntwo intact satellites – the Russian communications satellite\nKosmos 2251 and the American commercial satellite Iridium 33\n–resulting in approximately 700 additional pieces of ultrahazardous\ndebris being created, with the potential to cause add-\nitional decades-long pollution in space.li With the proliferation\nin actors and the exponential rise in small satellites and megaGlobal\nSustainability 5\n', 'constellations, there is a fear that the quantity of space debris will\nexplode.\n2.2.4.1. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee\nSpace Debris Mitigation Guidelines. In 1993, as a consequence\nof environmental concerns, the international community decided\nto establish among interested space agencies the Inter-Agency\nSpace Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) – an international\ngovernmental forum for the worldwide coordination of activities\nrelated to the issues of human-made and natural space debris.\n“The primary purpose of the IADC is to exchange information\non space debris research activities between member space agencies,\nto facilitate opportunities for cooperation in space debris\nresearch, to review the progress of ongoing cooperative activities\nand to identify debris mitigation options.”lii The IADC formulated\nthe IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelinesliii and for-\nmally adopted them by consensus in October 2002 during the\nSecond World Space Congress in Houston, Texas. Section 2 of\nthe IADC Guidelinesliv describes existing practices that have\nbeen identified and evaluated for limiting the generation of\nspace debris in the environment. The Guidelines cover the overall\nenvironmental impact of the missions with a focus on the limitation\nof debris released during normal operations, the minimiza-\ntion of the potential for in-orbit breakups, post-mission\ndisposal and the prevention of in-orbit collisions. The IADC presented\nits guidelines to the UNCOPUOS Scientific and Technical\nSubcommittee (STSC).\n2.2.4.2. The evolution of the Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\nthrough the UN system. The IADC Guidelines served as basis\nfor the development of the UN Space Debris Mitigation\nGuidelines. In 2007, the UN General Assembly endorsed the\nSpace Debris Mitigation Guidelines as adopted by the\nUNCOPUOS STSC. The UN General Assembly agreed in its\nResolution 62/217 that the voluntary guidelines for space debris\nmitigation reflected existing practices developed by numerous\nnational and international organizations. Space debris and their\ncascading effects are some of the greatest challenges for the longterm\nsustainability of space activities. Nonetheless, the existing\ninternational texts serve as ‘soft law’ at best. Member States are\ninvited to implement those guidelines through their relevant\nnational mechanisms. By doing so, policy-makers might ultimately\ncontribute to the formation of a due diligence standard, if\ninternational practice is representative.\nThe Resolution recognizes two broad categories of space debris\nmitigation measures: short-term measures (the limitation of the\nproduction of mission-related space debris and the avoidance of\nbreakups) and long-term measures (end-of-life procedures that\nremove decommissioned spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital\nstages from regions populated by operational spacecraft).\nThe seven guidelineslv remain at a general level and encourage\nactions that would:\n1. Limit debris released during normal operations;\n2. Minimize the potential for breakups during operational\nphases;\n3. Limit the probability of accidental collision in orbit;\n4. Avoid intentional destruction and other harmful activities;\n5. Minimize potential for post-mission breakups resulting from\nstored energy;\n6. Limit the long-term presence of spacecraft and launch vehicle\norbital stages in the LEO region after the end of their mission;\n7. Limit the long-term interference of spacecraft and launch\nvehicle orbital stages with the geosynchronous region after\nthe end of their mission.\nThe IADC is an open association of technical entities of rather\nhomogenous space-faring nations contrary to the UN, which\nincorporates the representatives of both space-faring and\nnon-space-faring States and so involving various opinions and\npartially diverging interests.lvi The UN Guidelines make clear reference\nto the IADC Guidelineslvii and invite the Member States\nand international organizations in chapter 6 of its Guidelines to\nrefer to the latest IADC guideline version “[…] for more in-depth\ndescriptions and recommendations pertaining to space debris\nmitigation measures.”lviii\nThe Report of the UNCOPUOS Legal Subcommittee from its\n57th sessionlix presents its proposal for the agenda items for the\nupcoming 58th session in 2019, indicating the “General exchange\nof information and views on legal mechanisms relating to space\ndebris mitigation and remediation measures, taking into account\nthe work of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee” as a dedicated\nitem for discussion within the Subcommittee. This clearly\nreflects the relevance of the space debris subject and the need to\nurgently clarify some uncertainties – such as the framework conditions\nfor active debris removal (ADR). Even though these efforts\nhad only limited success and Member States remained cautious\nregarding adopting new and even binding legal norms, the latest\nsession report addressed very important questions as regards the\nmatter of space debris mitigation.lx Recently, the Legal\nSubcommittee delegates expressed inter alia the need to adapt\nthe existing guidelines to the latest scientific and technical findings,\nto create legal certainty by defining the terms – such as\n‘space object’ and ‘space debris’lxi – and the need to establish an\ninternational fund for the removal of space debris in order to support\ncoordinated efforts on space debris removal by providing\nmeans to address the technological and financial aspects of such\noperations. The financial participation of States in the fund\nshould depend on the role of those States in the creation of\nspace debris.lxii\n2.2.4.3. The implementation of the Space Debris Mitigation\nGuidelines. States and space agencies implement the guidelines\ninto their national laws and regulations, aware of the fact that such\nimplementation serves their own interests in keeping the relevant\norbits accessible and useable. Some States are using the space debris\nmitigation guidelines, the European Code of Conduct for Space\nDebris Mitigation, International Organization for Standardization\nstandard 24113:2011 (Space systems: space debrismitigation requirements)\nand International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recom-\nmendation ITU-R S.1003 (‘Environmental protection of the\ngeostationary-satellite orbit’) as references in their regulatory frameworks\nfor national space activities.lxiii\nThe USA as a traditional major space-faring nation has an\nextensive set of rules regulating space debris mitigation – the\nbasis of which are the US Government Orbital Debris\nMitigation Standard Practices – as adopted in 2001.lxiv Those\nGuidelines served as one of the primary sources for the development\nof the IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines and the\nlater Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines of the Committee. As a\nfoundingmemberof the IADC,NASAhas played a leading role in discussions\nof space debris mitigation in the IADC and in the\nUNCOPUOS STSC. The NASA STD 8719.14 ‘Process for Limiting\nOrbital Debris’ and NASA-NPR-8715.6A ‘Procedural Requirements\n6 Ulrike M. Bohlmann and Gina Petrovici\n', 'for Limiting Orbital Debris’ also represent informative references\nfor other States.\nTwo European examples are Germany and France.lxv In 2012,\nGermany issued the ‘Product Assurance and Safety Requirements\nfor DLR Space Projects’, which include mandatory space debris\nmitigation requirements for all phases of space missions of the\nDLR Space Administration. The DLR requirements are consistent\nwith numerous international standards, to which development\nGermany has also contributed. The French national mechanism\nfor space debris mitigation is the mandatory Decree on\nTechnical Regulation issued pursuant to Act no. 2008-518 of\n3 June 2008, adopted on 31 March 2011. It contains all of the\ntechnical requirements for any operator and is composed of dedicated\nsections for launch systems and orbital systems. France has\nalso contributed to the development of international space debris\nmitigation standards. The French Technical Regulation is consistent\nwith these guidelines, as well as with the ISO 24113 standard.\nIn the context of space debris, active removal technologies are\nbeing considered as one key technology for the future. ADR\naims to reduce the number of large and massive (mostly physically\nintact) objects. Reducing the overall number of intact objects\nin space is not at all feasible considering the growing dependence\nof society on space activities and new trends, such as the installation\nof large and mega-constellations, providing inter alia tele-\ncommunication services in remote areas. Therefore, it is more\nimportant than ever before to strongly comply with post-mission\nmitigation measureslxvi in order to maintain the number of intact\nobjects and at the same time to deal with more objects in addition\nto those already in space. Studies show that with a removal\nsequence planned according to a target selection based on mass,\narea or cumulative collision risk, the environment can be stabilized\nwhen approximately five to ten objects are removed from\nLEO per year.\n3. Conclusion\nThe developments and innovations related to the new space era –\nSpace 4.0 – have led to an ever-increasing number of space actors,\nshifting from a traditionally governmental to an increasingly commercialized\nindustry. The range of potential space applications is\nexpanding, and the international community has become more\nand more dependent on space activities. Space helps to improve\nthe lives of people around the globe and helps us to face the challenges\nof our time. Space imagery and data enable experts to\ndevelop strategies to fight climate change and to reduce the damage\nresulting from environmental catastrophes.\nThe space debris problematic clearly shows that space activities,\nif conducted without the relevant legal and environmental\nconsiderations, can lead to huge danger for humankind and the\nenvironment and shows us that the international community\nneeds to work on a more agile and extensive legal regime ensuring\nand contributing to sustainability on Earth and in space.\nThe existing body of international space law touches upon\nenvironmental protection, but does not provide a comprehensive\nlegal framework for the protection of outer space, nor does it contain\nany strict environmental guidelines and principles regarding\nthe way space activities are conducted. General obligations relating\nto the environmental aspects of the exploration and use of\nouter space that are found in the UN Treaties or Principles\nneed to adapt to recent scientific, technological and industrial\ndevelopments. Article III of the OST emphasizes that “international\nlaw” applies to “activities in the exploration and use of\nouter space.” Nonetheless, some issues remain unresolved. One\nof them is the increasing privatization of outer space activities.\nState Parties to the OST are bound by its obligations and have\nto continuously supervise and control their activities, irrespective\nof whether they are conducted by the government or private\nactors. However, private actors are not per se bound by the UN\nSpace Treaties.lxvii They are subject to case-by-case variable local\nlaws and the provisions negotiated in commercial launch service\ncontracts.\nIn addition, it is not clear whether international law can be\napplied to the unique characteristics of activities conducted in\nthe extraterrestrial environment. Principle 21 of the 1972\nStockholm Declaration and Principle 2 of the 1992 Rio\nDeclaration on Environment and Developmentlxviii refer to\n“areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,” which can be\nconsidered to include outer space.\nThe regulation of future outer space activities necessitates\ncooperation among international partners and common\napproaches and commitments. Non-legally binding soft law\ninstruments will play a central role in creating legal certainty\nand filling in the ‘gaps’ in the corpus iuris spatialis. The\nUNCOPOUS Legal Subcommittee recently underlined the effectiveness\nof soft law instruments regulating the issue of space debris\nand ADR activities.lxix Since the first mentioning of sustainable\ndevelopment in the 1987 Brundtland Report, environmental considerations\nhave become more and more important, and not only\nfor the space industry. The codification of new emerging principles\ndealing with environmental considerations is to be expected\nto expand upon the fundamental regulations already existing in\nthe UN Space Treaties. The recent consent within the\nUNCOPUOS Legal Subcommittee over 21 long-term sustainability\nguidelineslxx paved the way for their implementation into\nnational law. This represents a decisive step towards ensuring\nthe sustainability of current and future space missions and a\nmajor contribution to UNISPACE + 50 Thematic Priority 3,\n‘Enhanced information exchange on space objects and events’.\nMoreover, the success of the UN/Germany High Level Forum\nin Bonn, Germany, in November 2018 reflects the increasing\nawareness and interest of the international community in the\nmatter of sustainable development.\nThe exploration and use of outer space for all humankind have\nto reflect the notions of cooperation and benefit – which are\nalready laid down in the OST, theMagna Carta of space activities.\nNotes\ni https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Ministerial_Council_2016/What_is_space_4.\n0 (accessed 10 June 2018).\nii Isabelle Duvaux-Béchon and Ulrike M.
