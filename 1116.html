NO. 213.\nKeokuk Company May\nBe Sent to Mexico\nSECRET TOLD\nBY PRESIDENT\n•Taft Gives Out the Reasons For the\nMobolizing of the United States\nArmy Along the Mexl-\nv.\ncan Border.\nTO END THE REVOLUTION\nI Uncle Sam Has Come to the Conclu\nsion That the Mexican In\nsurrection Has Gone\nFar Enough.\n1\nWASHINGTON, March 10.—That!\nI the administration has decided to dis-\nI semble no longer its reasons for sud-\nden and unprecedented movement of |irn|t\nI troops Lo the Mexican border is indi-1\ncated by the following .dispatch re\nceived last night from the staff cor\nrespondent who is accompanying\npresident Taft on his journey to At\nlanta. The dispatch, dated Charlottes\nville, Va., through which place the\npresident\'s train passed last night at\n7:10 o\'clock, is a$ follows:\nAll doubt as to the purpose of the\ngovernment in sending 20,000 troops\nto the Mexican border has at last\nbeen swept away. The United States\nhas determined that the revolution\nthe republic to the south must end.\nThe American troops have been sent\nto form a solid military wall along\nthe Rio Grande to Stop filibustering\nand to see that there is no further\nsmuggling of arms and men across\nthe international boundary. It is bu\nIieved that with this source of contra\nband supplied cut off ttig ittBurrectloiV\naty movement which has disturbed\nconditions generally for nearly a year\nwithout accomplishing anything like\nthe formation oi a responsible inde\npendent government, will speedily\ncome to a close.\nFirst of all, the government feared\nthe formation of an insurrection gov\nernment in Lower California, With\nthe formation of such a government\nthe United States would be compelled\nto keep continual watch on the whole\nsouthern frontier.\nSecondly, it was feared that Ameri\ncan property in Mexico, valued at\nhundreds of millions, might be swept\naway, and it was desired to protect,\nas well, the interest of foreigners\nvho, keeping in mind the Monroe doc\ntrine, might look naturally to ttie\nUnited States for such protection.\nThird, It was determined to stop\nfriends of the Mexican insurrectos\nfrom carrying supplies that are con\ntraband of war across the Rio Grande\nfrom Texas.\nLast of all, it was believed that\n"maneuvers" in Texas at this time\nwould show "jingoes" in congress and\nelsewhere that the army can be mob\nolized in case of difficulty in remark\nably quick time.\nThe array is going to Texas, and it\nIs going to stay there until there is\nreason to believe that serious trouble\nin Mexico\n1B\na\nno longer probable. It\n*111 patrol the border line with a fine\ntooth comb, and, if necessary, It will\nstep in to prevent anarchy and revolu\ntion that would endanger the lives\nand property of Americans and for\nsigners.\nTaft Well Satisfied.\nPresident Taft on his way to Augus\nta^ last night appeared well satisefld\nw\'th\nthe situation.

At\nrate, the matter was put up to\'\nthe administration in such away as to\ncall for the quickest sort of action.\nThe necessity for this speedy moboliza-\nyon\nwas seized upon by the war de-\nA dispatch from Washington\nsays that preparations are being\nmade at the war department for\nordering out the Iowa National\nGuards.\nFrank LeBron, captain of Com\npany of the Fifty-Fourth regl\nment of this city, wired Adju\ntant General Logan of Des\nMoines, stating that Company\nwas being held in readiness for\na call at any time, and is prepar\ned to go to the Mexican border.\nHe stated today that the com\npany could prepare for the trip\non ten hours notice.\nAt rifle practice last evening\nall members of the company\npresent were greatly enthused\nover the prospects, and are anxi\nous to receive the call.\nThe officers of Company ex\npect to be Invited to go and\nwatch the maneuvers, and if the\ninvitation is received Captain\nLeBron, First Lieutenant Sher\nlock and Second Lieutenant\nSmales, will go with the Iowa\nofficers. .•\nCaptain LeBron received invita-\ntlon t0 go and a|so orders to re.\ncru|t Co and equjp samet0 the\npartment as an opportunity to show\ncritics, both in and out of the coun\ntry, that interpretation was put upon\nthe movement.\nMovement is Significant.\nThe extenslveness of the medical\naccompaniments to the army and the\nnavy in the movement southward\nadds to the significance of the opera\ntions.\nThe hospital ship Solace will leave I\nGuantanamo in a day or two for New I\nYork or Norfolk with eighty Bick from\nthe battleship fleet now in the Cuban\nIt was learned from official sources\nthat there has been discussion be\ntween the state department and repre\nsentatives from several European na-\ntions, as to internal conditions in\nMexico, but it was said that this dis\ncussion had at no time taken on pro\nportions of what the diplomats call\n"representations."\nV- American Investments.\nWASHINGTON, March 10—The\nreason for Wall street\'s interest in\nMexican affairs is to be found in\nthe gigantic investments there by\nAmericans which are more than a bil\nlion dollars. The Morgau-Guggenheim\ninterests for instance controls the en\ntire copper output in Mexico. The\nWaters-Pierce Oil Co., has a complete\nmonopoly of the oil business.
