Nothing could be further, from \'the truth. The FCDA Act, of 1950 defines the term “Civil, Defense” as “. . .All those activi, ties and measures assigned or, undertaken to minimize the ef, fects upon the civilian population, caused or which could be caused, Iby an attack upon the United, States. . ..”, All activities, therefore, which, tend to “minimize the effects upon, the civilian population caused or, which could be caused by an at, tack upon the United States” are, Civil Defense activities., Civil Defense—the only kind of, Civil Defense that will pay off, concerns the responsibility of each, level of government to deal with, emergencies as they arise. Sup, pose your town were hit by a flood,, and this has happened in Maricopa, County, the town fathers would not, stand idle while squads of volun, teers rushed helter-skelter into the, fray. Rather, the mayor, police, chief and other officials would, employ all of their resources to, cope with the situation. Os course,, they would use volunteers. But,, such volunteers would serve as aux, iliaries to the departments of local, government and under the direc, tion of local government. They, would be part of local govern, ment., And, if the disaster were big, enough, your home town could ex, pect help from the Sate and, if, necessary, from all pertinent, agencies of the Federal Govern, ment. That is government in emer, gency action—the only real form, of Civil Defense., It is our job, here- in the Civil, Defense Joiht Council, to provide, guidance and assistance, and to, coordinate the emergency planning, activities ampng the various de, partments of local government., This includes also the development, Os plans to utilize full and coordi, nate the non-government leader, ship and resources into communi, ty emergency preparedness. Con, tinual liaison with us and other, departments of local government, must be maintained ensure, proper coordination. Up-to-date, emergency planning information,, guidance, and assistance is avail, able to you by just calling our of, fice., TRAINING, What can I do? Who is right, and who is wrong? Why do some, people tell us one thing and some, another? These, and similar ques, tions are being frequently asked of, our coordinators who are in con, tact with the local citizenry. We, think that one possible approach, in supplying the answers to the, many questions that are asked, by persons who are sincerely seek, ing information, is that we at, tempt to reason these problems out, together. We find it quite difficult,, when given only a brief 30 minutes, to make a public presentation, to, explain our entire civil defense, program. We find that we usually, do not satisfactorily answer the, many questions that are asked., We find that our subject matter, is simply too broad to properly, cover in one brief presentation., To educate the public in our pro, gram, we are offering certain es, tablished courses of instruction, pertinent to the many phases of, Civil Defense preparation. We fully, realize that it is impossible to get, everyone in the valley to attend, these courses that are now being, offered at our headquarters. Limit, ed space, time for classes, and the, availability of instructors are but, a few of the minor problems. But, we feel that those who have at, tended our many courses of in, struction can further assist in the, program in their respective neigh, borhoods. We know too that we, have certain courses that can be, 1 presented by persons who have the, qualifications but have not attend, ed a course. So, to get back to the, question that we started with, you, can help by trying to get a series, of courses in your neighborhood, church, school, or public assembly, room. You can attend this train, ing locally or at our headquarters., You can encourage your friends, and neighbors to investigate and, try to find what is actually being, done to assist and inform people, in the county: Call our Civil De, fense Headquarters.

The Govern, ment’s widely publicized “Plans, for Progress” program, devised, to expand Negro industrial em, ployment, was attacked this week, as “ineffectual” and diversionary, by a leading civil rights spokes, man., Herbert Hill, labor secretary, of the National Association for the, Advancement of Colored People,, made the charge in an appraisal, of the first year of operations of, the President’s committee on Equal, Employment Opportunity which, was established last April 7., Mr. Hill’s statement, released, simultaneously here and in Wash, ington on April 5, attributed fail, ure of the program to the Kennedy, Administration’s reluctance to, press for full implementation of its, non-discrJmii>ation policies in the, face, qf .southern, hostility, ., Under guidance, of Robert B., Troutman, Jr., of Atlanta, a mem, ber of the President’s Committee,, the “Plans for Progess’ program, has not produced lai’ge-scale op, portunities for Negro workers” and, has been used mcUM? tb “\'divert, attention and energy from the, systematic,. across-lhe-board job, which it is Government’s responsi, bility to carry out,” Mr. Hi 11, charged., -The program; he said, is largely, regarded by the major U! S. Gov, ernment contractors who have, signed it “as away of securing, immunity from real compliance, with the anti-discrimination pro, visions of-their .government .con, practice on ABC-TV when “The Law and Mr., Jones” returns to the Network Thursday, April, 19, 8:30 p. m., tracts. \'. \'.Thus, the ‘Plans for Pro, gress’ is simply an euphemism for, what in previous administrations, was called ‘voluntary compliance.”, Mr. Troutman, the NAACP spoke, man asserted, has “served the, national purpose in his usual fash, ion”—by serving his friends, Sen, ators Richard Russell and Her, man Talmadge of Georgia, and, racial segregation. This is “his, role as a member of the Presi, dent’s Committee on Equal Em, ployment Opportunity.”, Os the 1,850 complaints filed with, the Committee during the first, year, Mr. Hill noted that 448 were, filed by the NAACP including 82, against Federal agencies., The policies laid down in Ex, ecutive Order 10925, establishing, the Committee, are sound and rep, resent. “a ‘vast\' improvement. . ., oyer the orders of # preceding Presi, dents in barring employment dis, crimination,” Mr. Hill said. But,, he added,, these policies ,have not, been carried out because of fear, lest reactionary conservative forces, in the Congress “strangle the anti, discrimination employment pro, gram in its infancy.”, PATRONIZE SUN ADVERTISERS, wammmmßßrn, 7WO FLAGSTAFF CATTLEMEN in, /887 played poke* at \'one, WSitWiWl IV Ya/U STEEP ANTE, 7WO STEEPS COME, JN, AND NO LIMIT?", pBAMC VANDEDUP, ONE OP THE |, rahcheps, ppew a pa/rop hacks W" ~W ,lS ilfciJMp\', J AND OPENED nr/TH A BREEDING euLL.

Thomas, Associate Editor W. A. Robinson, Photography Cloves Campbell, “My people are destroyed lor lack of knowledge.” (Hosea 4:6), A Host Unpleasant Responsibility..., For several years the NAACP has had the belief that our, greatest responsibility is to improve the employment opportunities, for Negroes in Phoenix: not forgetting the complex of other prob, lems which are involved. The Reverend George B. Brooks has seen, this need more clearly than many of us for a long time. His ex, perience as a young Presbyterian minister on the south side caused, him to assume a deep interest in the young people in his parish and, through them in many other Negro youth on the south side. This, has sharpened his awareness of the problems of these young people, in securing jobs. He has seen also what the frustrations of con, tinued failure to secure jobs can do to Negro youth., Through the past several years he has taken many Negroes to, the electronics plants and has sat in their offices. He has been told, over and over again that they have no policy of discrimination but, that they have na jobs. This after he has been told that they are, hiring. He has seen young people leave applications and never,, never, hear any thing from them. He has made efforts to find, out from the plants how many Negroes they have employed and has, been told by them that they cannot “for security reasons" < whose, security? 2 give out this information, or that they do not know who, among their employees are Negroes. The Urban League, which, has a definite responsibility ’to increase employment opportunities, for Negroes haS" been similarly rebuffed. The jobs sought have, most often been work on the assembly lines on which hundreds are, many as trainees, hut no Negroes., When Reverend Brooks was elected president of the NAACP., hearly tjvo years ago. he pledged the branch to increased efforts, •to track down any evasions of laws or executive orders by firms, \'with ‘ federal or state contracts or by state or other governmental, agencies through which these plants seek employees., By an act of Go there fell into the hands of the NAACP. a, *copy of a memo, sent out by a supervisor of case workers to other, supervisors in similar positions, stating that General Electric had, issued a work order, presumably through proper channels, asking, for wfruen workers from welfare rolls, between 18 and 36 years,, high school graduates, and white, and need not have taken the, General Aptitude Test Battery fG.A.T.B.t. The memo originated, with Mrs. M. Clark and stated that it was from a telephone call, fronv Patterson and that contacts should be made with two, people in the State Employment agency., Unquestionably this was a work order which by federal execu, tive Order and State legislation should never have been accpeted in, the first place*/ and in the second place, if accepted and processed,, was a criminal offense on the part of the federal, state, and county, agencies involved, and a serious violation of a federal order by the, firths involved., What was the duty of the NAACP upon receiving this factual, evidence of discrimination if not to get all the possible facts that, such atn organization is entitled to secure and to pass them on to, the legal agencies whose duty it is to see that this information is, carefully assessed by the proper governmental agencies? Certainly, we were-crass amateurs at this effort. The many denials and switch, es iq responsibility which were immediately evident would indicate, to us that those involved counted on this. But they probably did not, our persistence., Hu Reverend Brooks had been too timid to accept his duties, 5n this regard, he would have been less than the kind of man than, the NAACP THOUGHT THEV WERE ELECTING TO THE PRESI, DENCY. He would have been leaving the Negro women on the rolls, of the county welfare, who are not given this opportunity for re, habilitation by a job, open to the accusation so often made, that they, are chisellers, who prefer welfare to a job. He would be permitting, the firms to Which, over several years, he has personally taken, men and women, desperately seeking away of making an, honest -livelihood, to continue this policy, of discrimination for which, he already has prima facie evidence for believing it to exist., None of this is a pleasant task. It became more unpleasant, -When the person involved by name proved to be a nervous little, \'woman who stated that she was expecting us and, in answer to our, questions, stated that she does not know how she could have made, the mistake but she is sure that she misunderstood Mr. Patterson, of the State Rehabilitation office and she is taking full responsibility, for having passed on a statement yvhich he did not make. She, smiled wanly when she was told by me that it was our duty to fol, low this eviderttre through to all the agencies concerned. To this she, .answered that this was our responsibility and we could do this, If v6e wanted Ip., Was\'she\'speaking from the assurance, from somewhere along, the line, that she would be “taken eare of’’ if she assumed the full, .responsibility? Who knows? She was asked if everything else in, the memo was correct and replied that it was. Yet on the next day, she said that the firm involved was not General Electric but Motor, ola. What transpired to make this change necessary? Who knows?, Who would want to cause trouble to a mild little woman who, admits a mistake? On the other hand, can the NAACP be accused, of lacking compassion, and of rabble rousing, because it follows, through on the first incontrovertible evidence that perhaps hundreds, of Negroes have been robbed of work opportunities for honest em, ployment the level of their skills?, We can thank Heaven that we now have a newspaper that will, publish straight news of the evidence that we have and of the per, sistence of our efforts to correct, if it exists, the unfairness of all, involved. Who else could do this with less insecurity of reprisal than, a Presbyterian minister and a retired school principal? I can assure, •anyone that doubts it that neither of us enjoys this. We are com, plete amateurs; but we and the NAACP know that, if as Negroes,, we are enjoying any better opportunities today than were enjoyed, by our parents yesterday, somebody worked yesterday at difficult,, sometimes dangerous, and always unpleasant tasks. If our children, are to have a better life tomorrow, someone must tackle these, thankless tasks today. Rev,-Brooks is a dedicated young minister, and the NAACP is fortunate that he is in the chair at this crucial, time “ W. A.

She said, school districts often tend simply, to expand zone lines around the, increasing Negro residential sec, tion rather than form new zones, which include both the white and, Negro for true integration., The zone lines are man-made,, she cited, and therefore can be, altered by man to guarantee in, tegrated enrollment., MISS showed the, board several new zoning ap, proaches, including the Princeton,, N.

The National, Association for the Advancement, of Colored People has appealed, to the Soviet Union for clemency, in the cases of 15 Soviet citizens,, at least 12 of them Jews, convict, ed and “sentenced to death by, shooting for various alleged eco, nomic offenses.”, In a letter to Anatoli F.

Anatoli F. Dobrynin, Ambassador of the Union of, Soviet Socialist Republics, 1125 16th Street, Washington, D. C., Sir:, Representing, as it does, a, group which has long suffered, the troubles of discrimination, and segregation, the National, Association for the Advance, ment of Colored People con, siders with increased concern, the fate of Soviet Jewry. The, shocking events of recent weeks, within the Soviet Union have, brought the situation to a pass, which forces us to speak out in, protest. The actions of the, Soviet Union again bear wit, ness to the fact that totali, tarianism in any form, to the, left or to the right, utilizes, weapon of group persecution, and discrimination in its at- i, tempt to secure and to main, tain power., Since last July, fifteen Soviet, citizens have been sentenced 1, to death by shooting for vari, ous alleged economic offenses, ,, such as currency speculation ., and black marketeering. At ,, least twelve, and probably, more, of them are Jews. j, Many of them were sent, enced to death for offenses (, committed at a time when the, law did not call for capital, punishment. In at least three, cases, a lesser penalty, meted, out upon conviction, was in, creased to capital punishment, who expects to be challenging the top heavys in, the country in the near nuure.

Much, of the campaign against Portugal, “arises, curiously enough, from, our virtues and not our faults,”, Pedro Theotonie Pereiera, Portu, guese Ambassador to the United, States, told the Commonwealth, Club of California in a recent ad, dress., Speaking specifically on the Port, ugese province of Angola, West, Africa, the Ambassador stated that, the Portuguese in Africa stand in, the way of black racism and rabid, nationalism on the one hand and, the Communist objective of domi, nating the continent on the other., “We are, in fact,” noted the, Ambassador, “a barrier against, sinister forces. That explains the;, unrelenting, almost frenzied drive l, against us. We stand in the way;, of black racism and rabid national, ism, which seek to drive the whites, from Africa, or to subjugate them, because they are white and be, cause of the past. This is discrimi, nation based on skin color. It is, just as repugnant when directed, lat the white race as it is when, directed at a colored race., “The Portuguese African terri, tories stand in the way of the Com, munist aim of chaos, confusion, and turmoil in Africa. These create, the situation which breeds Commu, nism; they are the prerequisite, to Communist plans for a take, over. Because it plans to develop, Angola and Mozambique as rapid, ly as possible, Portugal is a threat, to both racism and Communism., These evil forces hate and fear, us., “The cooperation of both races, in the orderly development of Afri, ca, if there is to be an orderly, development, is imperative. Other, wise the costly and bitter struggle, already under way in the Congo, and other parts of Africa will con, tinue indefinitely.”, The Portuguese Ambassador said, that if the Portuguese provinces, established a pattern for racial, harmony, the influence on the Af, rican continent would be profound, *bj- • I*\' - ( -v® - jy, k > jtato r ; *JM, SITTING IT OUT—Sitting this one out at the, Omegas Western dance are Blanche Hooks,, Betty Spicer, Quida Brown and Ponteeka Wake., (SUN Photo by Cloves Campbell, [Negro Advisor Named, White House Aide, Deputy Chairman of the Nation, al Democratic National Commit, tee, Louis Marlin, wiio is regard, ed as the most powerful Kennedy, Negro advisor, is slated to become, a Whjite House Aide in the next, few weeks., White House race relations ad, ivisor, Harris Wofford, has been, named as Peace Corps representa, tive in Ethiopia.
