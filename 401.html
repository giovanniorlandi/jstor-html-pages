All the assets and supporting\nvehicles are linked to each other with a communication network, and it is called the network-centric warfare environment. Hence,\nit is critical when communication failure occurs during engagement in ground battlefield because this failure will directly affect\noverall combat effectiveness of one‚Äôs owned assets. However, research regarding communication failure issues is scarce. We herein\npropose a new agent-based modeling process to measure the overall combat effectiveness combined with communication success\nratio, based on the terrain condition of the ground engagement. Additionally, we provide the effectiveness analysis result when a\ncommunication repeater is applied during communication failure as an alternative measure.\n1. Introduction\nTo construct a war-game model, the Lanchester-type equation\nis a typical tool to generate the value of attrition rates\nfor both sides of the battle. It appears reasonable when the\ngame proceeds unit by unit and asset by asset, which is called\nthe platform-centric warfare. However, it has been rapidly\nchanged, in modern warfare, to the network-centric warfare,\nin which all platforms are linked to each other to create a large\nand complex warfare environment.\nTherefore, agent-based modeling (ABM) has been used\nwidely to build a war-game model recently, because it can\nproduce more realistic results based on its own decisions\nand actions for all platforms regarded as agents in a complex\nsystem of the battle.\nFurthermore, in the previous war-game model, the communication\nerror effect (CEE) was not considered and its\npossible effect on each weapon system was not reflected\neither. However, the CEE is an important factor in networkcentric\nwarfare because all platforms in a battle are connected\nto each other to share the target and damage information, as\nwell as exchanging the order and report among related units\naccording to the echelon chain.\nThe agent-based simulation framework we propose\nherein consists of three key themes: ABM, CEE, and line of\nsight (LOS), as shown in Figure 1.\nIn this study, we consider both ABM and CEEs in a\nnetwork-centric warfare environment and provide a new\nmodeling process to measure the combat effectiveness in a\nhigh resolution war-game model considering communication\nfailure.\nAs for the quantitative measurement of combat effectiveness\n(CE), Hayward [1] proposed three factors to quantify\nCE as capabilities, environment, and missions. However, it is\nstill difficult to measure the quantitative combat effectiveness\nowing to its intangible and subjective characteristics. It is also\nHindawi\nMathematical Problems in Engineering\nVolume 2018, Article ID 2730671, 9 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2018/2730671\n", '2 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\nA B M\n(Detect & Attack)\nA B M\n(Damage Report)\nA B M\n(Move)\nCEE\nNLOS\nNon CEE\nLOS\nFigure 1: Configuration of a typical battlefield in high resolution.\nimpractical to measure the CE experimentally. Recently, Kim\net al. [2] reported a literature review of the work by CE. Lee\nand Lee [3] and Lee et al. [4‚Äì6] proposed a network-based\nmetric for measuring CE.\nABM related studies in war-game simulation are Hill et\nal. [7], Cil et al. [8], Seo, et al. [9], Connors et al. [10], and\nThomson et al. [11]. Regarding the study of communication\nfactor and modeling in the NCW environment, several\nresearches have reported the partial impact to CE in a\nparticular situation such as Sen et al. [12], Karedal et al.\n[13, 14], Kang et al. [15], Shin et al. [16], Cheng et al. [17], Li et\nal. [18], Akhtar et al. [19], Shin et al. [20], and Lee et al. [21].\nOur study retains three factors that are different from\nthe papers above because we developed our own model to\ngenerate the communication error, provide an alternative\nmeasure for communication failure, and compare the CE\nresults with those from the army weapon analysis model\n(AWAM), which is an official analysis model used in the US\nand Korean army.\n2. Communication Process in NCW\n2.1. Overview of Communication Impact to Combat Effectiveness.\nIt is assumed, without loss of generality, that the overall\nmeasurement of CE is the probability of success in combat\noperations. Therefore, the primary measure of effectiveness\n(MOE) in our model would be the blue survival ratio (BSR),\nmeaning the ratio of remaining assets (when blue wins) over\nthe initial assets for the blue force side against the red force.\nThe study showed how the CEE changes the BSR depending\nupon the level of communication success probability.\nFor the representation of CEE, we used terrain map that\nshows the altitude of the terrain in each specified location.\nHence, different altitude levels are expressed by each small\ncell area depending upon the geographic surface pattern of\nthe battle ground. When the LOS between two platforms is\nvisible, no CEE would be applied. Meanwhile, if the LOS\nbetween two platforms is blocked, CEE will occur and the\ncommunication success probability (CSP) would be calculated\nby the model we developed. During the engagement, all\norders from command and control (C2) and the responding\nactions from all platforms such as tanks and unmanned\nground vehicles will be delivered via the communication\nprocess. The overall structure of the communication process\nfor delivering orders and reports during the engagement is\nshown in Figure 2.\nWe also used AnyLogic 7.0 to represent all these processes\nand conditions to validate the logic in the NCW war-game\nenvironment.\n2.2. Communication Failure Function. To consider the effect\nof communication error within a war-game model, we used\nthe path loss model that is a function describing the communication\nin the physical layer between the transmitter (TX)\nand receiver (RX) as a method of expressing communication.\nThis model is based on the free path loss function and is\nimplemented by the communication channel environment\nand the distance between TX and RX. Two types of path loss\nfunction used according to the LOS or non-LOS (NLOS) are\nshown in Table 1.\n3. Model Development\n3.1. Basic Scenario. To generate the overall measurement of\nMOE and to estimate the average value of the BSR, a typical\nscenario was established.The input data are shown in Table 2.\nA virtual area of size 10 km √ó 20 km was extracted from the\ndemilitarized zone region and is formulated as a digitized\nmap with each altitude illustrated in each terrain cell. The\ncombat assets were initially deployed to the engagement for\nboth the blue and red sides. The POD and POH for each\nside were assigned as a linear function depending upon the\ndistance from the firing platform to the target.\n3.2. Structure of the Agent-Based Model. The agent-based\nmodel proposed consists of three subprograms: primary,\nunit agent, and subagent. The primary program provides\nthe environment of the battle ground and the generating,\npositioning, and setting avenues of approach for the unit\nagent. The unit agent is also known as the platform agent\nthat defines all types of functions that the subagents would\nperform based on the prespecified rules defined by the unit\nagent. Subagents are function-oriented agents that perform a\nmission assigned by the corresponding unit agent.\nThe overall structure of the agent-based model is shown\nin Figure 3.\n3.3. Process of Communication Agent. Both the TX and RX\nare always required to perform communication success or\nfailure. Basically, three steps are required to send a message\nto the receiver such as (1) Comm.On, (2) Sending Msg., and\n(3) Comm.End. The detailed process is shown in Figure 4.\n', 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering 3\nTable 1: Path loss functions applied to evaluate the communication effect.\nScenario Path loss [dB] Shadow\nfading St[dB]\nApplicability range,\nAnt.

The overall process of the communication\nagent is as follows. Both the TX and RX can create a\ncommunication agent containing information. Further, the\nTX sends a message to the RX, known as the ‚Äúcommunication\nstart.‚Äù The Rx that received the message transmits\nan acknowledgment (ACK) message indicating that the\ncorresponding message has been received from the TX.\nSubsequently, both channels are open to communication and\nan information/order such as a specific coordinate or text\nmessage can be sent. The success of this process creates the\ncommunication agent in the TX, and the RX is deleted after\npassing the command.\nAdditionally, if the transmission fails within 2 s, transmission\nis attempted again. If this process is not successful after\nthree times, we assume that the transmission has failed.\n3.4. Process of C2 Agent. The C2 agent delivers all types of\nmessages to either send orders or receive the information\nrequired via the communication agent. It assigns orders to\nthe tanks and UGVs. It also collects the enemy target-related\nTable 2: A scenario for engagement of ground battle.\nVirtual area 20km x 10km\n5 reconnaissance routes between\nblue and red forces\nTerrain Cell\nCell Size 400 m √ó 400 m\nthe number\nof Cell 1,250\nCell‚Äôs\nAttribute Altitude\nCombat Assets\nBlue\nTank 30\nC2 10\nUGV 2\nRed Tank 15\nC2 5\nPOD (probability of detection) &\nPOH (probability of hit)\nPOD POH\nBlue ‚àí0.02d[m]+100 ‚àí0.04d[m]+100\nRed ‚àí0.013d[m]+100 ‚àí0.017d[m]+100\n', '4 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\nDetect\nAgent\nShoot\nAgent\nC2\nBattle\nField\nMain\n‚Ä¢ Battle field for combat\n‚Ä¢ Create and set location UGV, \nTank, C2\n‚Ä¢ Set moving path to enemy\nzone for UGV, Tank, C2 Main \nMossion\nDetecting\nCombat\nOrdering\nTank\nUGV\nSub-Agent\n‚Ä¢Agent used by unit agents.\n‚Ä¢Mission-centric agent\nUnit Agent\n‚Ä¢ Identify UGV, Tank, C2 by \nselecting Sub-agent among 6 Subagent\nbased main mission.\nCannon Agent\nCommand\nand Control\n(C2)\nBasic\nSub-agent\nManeuver\nAgent\nCommunication\nBDA\nFigure 3: Agent structure of the model.\nProcess of each sending\n& receiving\nLINK_ON\nDISCARD\nLISTENR\n‚Ä¢ Sending msg success \ncondition\n‚Äì Sending msg in 2 \nseconds\n‚Ä¢ DISCARD condition\n‚Äì Sending error over \n2 seconds\n‚Äì Re-sending over 3 \ntimes\nLINK_ON\nDISCARD\nLISTENR\nSending\nSending ACK\nTX Agent RX Agent\nSending ACK\n‚ë† Comm. on\n‚ë° Sending Msg\nSending ACK\nComm.\nsuccess\nFull Process Comm.\n‚Ä¢ If it success ‚ë† ~\n‚ë¢ process\n‚Äì Comm.

For example, when the UGV finds the enemy\ntarget, its information goes to the C2 agent with a message\n‚ÄúFind.‚Äù Subsequently, the C2 agent executes the inner process\nand assigns an order of either ‚ÄúMove‚Äù or ‚ÄúFire‚Äù to the\nsender. The role and process of the C2 agent is shown in\nFigure 5.\n3.5. Process of BDA Agent. When a battle occurs, we must\nperform a battle damage analysis (BDA) that produces casualties\nof both red and blue forces.The BDA agent performs an\nassessment to calculate the casualties during the battle.When\na platform is hit by an adversary weapon, one of three cases\noccurs: M-Kill, A-Kill, or T-Kill, as follows.\n', 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering 5\n: Move & Fire\n: Find\n‚àó\nUGV\nRadar\nFOR\n_UGV\nC2\nFind To \nTarget\nRadar\nFind\nFire\nFind\nFOR\n_TANK\nMove To \nTargetMove\nTank\nUGV\n‚ë† Find\n‚ë° Move & Fire\n‚ë¢ Find\nC2\n#N\nFigure 5: Role and process of C2 Agent.\n(1) M-Kill: mobility kill; it cannot move but fires the\nenemy targets.\n(2) F-Kill: fire kill; it cannot fire to aim the targets but\nmoves to other locations.\n(3) T-Kill: total kill; it is the case of total destruction in\nboth mobility and firing capability.\nHence, in M-Kill, it remains in position and performs firing\nwhenever required. The maneuvering agent is automatically\ndisconnected by the M-Kill agent.\nMeanwhile, in F-Kill, the shooting agent is disconnected\nand continues moving based on the mission.\nWhen T-Kill occurs, it disappears in the battlefield until\nthe end of the war-game replication. See Figure 6.\n3.6. Measure of Effectiveness. To analyze the CE in a simulation\nmodel, we used the BSR as a measure of effectiveness\nindicating the level of capability to win in a battle. The BSR\nand red survival ratio (RSR) are calculated as follows.\nInitially, the remaining assets (ùêµùëá/ùëÖùëá) are calculated at\nthe end of engagement for both sides.\nNext, they are compared with the initial assets (ùêµ0/ùëÖ0),\nand their ratios are counted for both sides.\nHence, the BSR and RSR were calculated by\nùêµùëÜùëÖ =\nùêµùëá\nùêµ0\n√ó 100,\nùëÖùëÜùëÖ =\nùëÖùëá\nùëÖ0\n√ó 100\n(1)\nThe BSR and RSR represent the ratio of survival assets\ncompared to its corresponding original assets. In otherwords,\nthey are merely the blue survival ratio and red survival\nratio after the battle has completed. The condition of the\nbattle termination is supposed to be predefined before the\nsimulation is run.\n4. Output Analysis\n4.1. Communication Failure and TerrainMaps Are Considered.\nThe path loss functions in Table 1 are used to consider the\nCEE within an engagement model. According to the distance\nbetween the agents, the CSP is determined as shown in\nFigure 7. The X-axis depicts the distance between agents,\nand the Y-axis depicts the communication power arriving at\nthe RX. The threshold (depending upon the value of K in\n', '6 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\nCannon(BDA) Agent\nTarget\nBDA System\nM-kill(Moving Kill)\n(No Moving)\nA-kill(Attack Kill)\n(No Shooting)\nT-kill : Total Kill\n(M-kill + A-kill)\nFigure 6: Role and process of BDA agent.\nthreshold\nPath-loss function\ndistance\nPower\n(dB)\nmean\nFigure 7: Path loss function and threshold to decide CSP.\n(2)) represents the minimum communication power that the\nRX can recognize. It also signifies the receiver‚Äôs performance\ncapability to obtain the signal power. Hence, a larger K value\nrenders a lower threshold, thus providing a higher probability\nof communication success.Meanwhile, the smaller value of K\nproduces a lower probability of communication success.\nùëá‚Ñéùëüùëíùë†‚Ñéùëúùëôùëë = ‚àí (ùêæ √ó ùúé) + ùëöùëíùëéùëõ (ùëëùêµ) ‚àí 3 ‚â§ ùêæ ‚â§ 3 (2)\nTo assess the relationship trend depending upon the level\nof LOS, terrain maps are also considered in two cases of both\nthe simplified and commercial cases, as shown in Table 3.\nCase 1 provides more room for a higher probability of LOS\nthan Case 2.\nFigure 8 shows the different values of the BSR for both\nCase 1 and Case 2 and its changing trend over the level of\nperformance capability of the RX.\nBased on this experiment, it is clear that more room for\nthe LOS and the high quality of the RX provide a better MOE\nTable 3: Two cases for terrain condition.\nCases Blue Force Red Force\nCase-1\nSimplified Digital Map K: 1, 0.5, 0, -0.5 K: 1\nCase-2\nCommercial Digital Map K: 1, 0.5, 0, -0.5 K: 1\nBSR(%)\nK\n40.0\n1 0.5 0\n50.2\n59.2\nBSR(Case 1) BSR(Case 2)\n71.8\n69.4\n61.3\n78.6\n84.086.3\n‚àí0.5\n50.0\n60.0\n70.0\n80.0\n90.0\nFigure 8: BSR comparison depending upon both CSP and terrain\ncondition.\nvalue (BSR) of the CE. In this particular scenario, Case 1\ndemonstrates a 7.7%‚Äì12.2% higher BSR value than Case 2.\n4.2. Alternative Measure Considered. To compensate and\novercome communication failure, a typical measure was\nperformed. In other words, a communication repeater is\naddedwhenever communication failure occurs. In themodel,\nwe assumed that all the blue unit‚Äôs platforms serve as a\ncommunication repeater. Three scenarios are established, as\nshown in Table 4.\nIn Scenario 1, the terrain condition is clear and the LOS\nwill function at all times. In Scenario 2, however, the LOS\n', 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering 7\nTable 4: Three scenarios for different LOS and Non-LOS(NLOS) conditions.\nScenario Scenario-#1 Scenario-#2 Scenario-#3\nSituation Communication in only LOS\nsituation\nCommunication in LOS / NLOS\nsituation\nCommunication using\nCommunication Repeater in\nLOS / NLOS situation\nScenario #1\n81.6%\n83%\n84.7%\nBSR (%)85\n84.5\n84\n83.5\n83\n82.5\n82\n81.5\n81\n80.5\n80\nScenario #2 Scenario #3\nFigure 9: BSR comparison depending upon communication\nrepeater.\nwould be blocked and would depend on the terrain condition\nwhere both the TX and RX are located. Scenario 3 is the same\nas Scenario 2 but with a communication repeater.\nFigure 9 shows the different values of BSR among the\nthree scenarios. The MOE value of Scenario 1 is the highest\nwhile that of Scenario 2 is the lowest and that of Scenario\n3 is somewhere in between that of scenarios 1 and 2. This\nexperiment shows the quantitative effectiveness of the new\nmeasure of using a communication repeater when the CSP\nvalue is poor.\nWe can also apply this result to decide whether to\npurchase a communication repeater by performing a cost\nbenefit analysis. Based on this assessment approach, more\nvaluable information will be obtained such as the optimal\nnumber of communication repeaters and the optimal level of\nCSP to add a communication repeater.\n4.3. Validation of the Model Performed. An issue in the\nsimulation approach is the validation problem to verify\nfor fitting to the real-world situation. To perform model\nvalidation, we use the AWAM and compare its result to those\nfrom our model called ‚ÄúABSim.‚Äù The AWAM is the most\npopular and powerful analytic tool for both the US and\nKorean Army.\nThe validation process is as follows:\n(1) Establish a scenario\n(2) Build the input data\n(3) Perform the experiment\n(4) Compare the results\nExchange ratio\nSecond\n1.5439\n1.3299\n0.9707\n0.8786\n0.7111\n0.3313\n0.8479\n1.1953\n2.0000\n1.6000\n1.2000\n0.8000\n0.4000\n0.0000\n0 3 6\nABSim AWAM\n9\nFigure 10: Comparison of both models depending upon time delay\nowing to communication failure.\nTo create the same environment for fair comparison for both\nmodels (AWAM and ABSim), input data such as the initial\nassets for the blue and red forces are the same, and the output\nperformance is measured as an exchange ratio. Additionally,\nwe change the time delay owing to communication failure at\nevery 3 seconds and compare the result values of exchange\nratio. The exchange ratio is the number of red forces for one\nunit of blue forces. For the blue side, the larger exchange ratio\nis better.\nFigure 10 shows the values of exchange ratio depending\nupon the time delay owing to the communication failure of\nboth models. A gap exists between the results of the two\nmodels, but it is fairly consistent over the time delay within\na certain range.\nAccording to many subject matter experts (SMEs), we\nfound three reasons to create a gap between two models.\n(1) The AWAMuses confidential data such as probability\nof detection, and probability of hit, which are not\nopened to the public; therefore, ABSim had to use\nassumed data referenced by the SME.\n(2) A gap exists in the level of fidelity on the terrain map\nfor both models.\n(3) Different tactics are used for moving and the tactical\nbehaviors for both models.\nMany SMEs reported that reasons above can compensate\nfor the gap shown in Figure 10 between two models.\n', '8 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\n5. Conclusion\nWe proposed a new simulation process considering communication\nfailure in a network-centric warfare environment. To\nmeasure the quantitative CE in a network-based battlefield,\nwe consider both the CEE and LOS depending upon the\naltitude of the terrain cell.\nThe MOE values obtained from the model we developed\nindicated that the LOS and CEE were highly correlated to\neach other. This implies that a clear LOS scenario obtains a\nhigher BSR (we used MOE) value compared to the NLOS\nsituation.\nWe also demonstrated the effectiveness when the communication\nrepeater was applied during communication\nfailure. This may provide insight into the method to obtain\nthe optimal policy for adapting the communication repeater,\nsuch as the optimal number or optimal time to add a\ncommunication repeater.\nFinally, we compared the simulation results from our\nmodel to the one from AWAM and found that both results\nwere fairly consistent.\nWe came to a conclusion that communication failure is\none of the key factors and has to be kept in good condition for\nwhole engagement process in a network-centric operational\nenvironment.\nData Availability\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are\navailable from the corresponding author upon request.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nAcknowledgments\nThis studywas supported by the FutureGround SystemAnalysis\nLaboratory (UC130068ID) of the Agency for Defense\nDevelopment.\nReferences\n[1] P.
