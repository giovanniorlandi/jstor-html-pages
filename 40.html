He appears in the memoir of British \nsoldier Stephen Bartlett Lakeman, titled What I Saw in Kaffir-land (1880). In \nthe text he is oblivious to pain even as he bemoans the irreparable damage to his \nWestley-Richards rifle. He is a leader of the ‘Fingo’ African levies. He can therefore be \ndistilled into a history of the general presence of African levies on the Eastern Cape \nfrontier. Although soldiers, Johnny Fingo and his levies are also defined by their sartorial\nchoices, as captured in the words of Lakeman and other British officers. This \narticle explores how the nineteenth-century South African figure of the ‘African levy’,1 \nan irregular and underpaid soldier, foreshadows the emergence of the more enduring \narchetype, namely that of the ‘Zulu Policeman’. Both of these characters/archetypes \nare bound by the fact that they were paid to fight; war was their work. This world \nof war work was, however, not sterile; both ‘Johnny Fingo’ and the ‘Zulu Policeman’ \nwore clothing (uniformed non-uniforms) which made these men swagger.\nIt is very curious to see the cast-off clothes of all the armies of Europe finding\ntheir way hither. The natives of South Africa prefer an old uniform coat, \nor tunic, to any other covering, and the effect of a short scarlet garment, \nwhen worn with bare legs, is irresistibly droll. The apparently inexhaustible \nsupply of old-fashioned English coatees, with their worsted epaulettes, is \nonly just coming to an end here, and is succeeded by an influx of ragged red \ntunics of franc-tireurs, green jackets, and much-worn Prussian grey coats. \nKafirland [sic] may be looked upon as the old clothes-shop of all the fighting\nworld, for, sooner or later, every cast-off scrap of soldier’s clothing drifts \ntowards it.2\nHow much has been concealed, how much has been defended in \nAprons! Nay, rightly considered, what is your whole Military and Police \nEstablishment, charged at uncalculated millions, but a huge scarletcoloured,\niron-fastened Apron, wherein Society works (uneasily enough); \nguarding itself from some soil and stithy-sparks, in this Devil’s smithy … of \na world?3\n1 In the Oxford Essential Dictionary of the US Military, four definitions of the word ‘levy’ are provided. ‘Levy’ v. -ies, -ied, archaic \nenlist (someone) for military service; begin to wage (war); n. pl. –ies, an act of enlisting troops; (usually levies) a body of troops \nthat have been enlisted: lightly armed local levies. ‘levy.’ In The Oxford Essential Dictionary of the US Military: Oxford University \nPress, 2001. http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199891580.001.0001/acref-9780199891580-e-4554, last \naccessed 9 November 2016.\n2 M.

There is no neutral way of writing about the soldier’s\nwork. The human costs of war are such as to focus our attention on the horror \nand the tragedy. Thus, the symbolic power and desirability of the soldier’s clothing \n– whether a uniform or not – seems like an odd object of study. The propagandist \nnature of narratives of war turns almost entirely on the fact that the only sources \nwe have for knowing what it is like to be in a war zone are the accounts of the combatants\nthemselves. As the recent historical experience of ‘embedded journalists’ \nbeing introduced into combat zones by the US Department of Defense during the \nIraq War (2003–2011) illustrates, even the accounts of eyewitnesses may not be all \nthat reliable. The contradiction inherent in this article is that in it I write about the \nclothing worn by African men who served in armies and police forces without actually\nwriting about war or violence. In my research so far, I have found no images of \nMfengu levies or Zulu policemen in action. This already signals the workings of a \npropagandist archive. The most ‘violent’ pictures I have found involve the arrest of \na suspect (these are common in the history of Africa and have been written about).4 \nWhat has not been theorised, is the aesthetic appeal of these photographs. When \nconfronted with the word ‘swagger’, it boggles the mind to think through what a word \nsuch as this is doing in a war zone or any zone of policing and law enforcement. It \nis words like these (and their visual accompaniments) that this article is chasing and \nattempting to historicise. I take it as a given that, as the ‘silent warriors’ in these accounts,\nAfrican levies and policemen didn’t really represent themselves; they were \nrepresented by others. However, I also take it as a given that there are limits to both \ncompulsion and invention. Although constrained by the very fact of being enlisted \nand conscripted, African men seem to have displayed an inventiveness in their dress \nthat cannot be dismissed as ‘war propaganda’ or mimicry of their white officers. As \nCarolyn Hamilton has cautioned us in relation to Zulu history in general, invention \nis only effective if it presents a horizon of plausibility.5 Thus, although the masculinity \nof Zulu men (and their Mfengu predecessors) was warped and tainted by its colonial \ndesirability, it doesn’t mean that Zulu men didn’t command a self-elected presence. \nFor colonialism’s capture of Zulu masculinity to be effective for the purposes of war, it \nhad to present these men’s masculinity as being continuous with some notion of precolonial\nself-image or selfhood. Colonialism simply didn’t have the creative power to \nwholly ‘invent’ the Zulu man or by extension the Zulu policeman without the participation\nof these men. This is because the very notion of ‘Zuluness’ was being created \nand contested, and could therefore not be easily enfolded into a colonising project.6 \nIt is not surprising that the colonial archive is replete with photographs of African \n4 C.

However, photographs of policemen constitute a category that deserves to be \nstudied separately from other kinds of photographs. One of the justifying positions of \nthis article is the observation that studies of colonialism and empire in South Africa \nhave mainly focused on the state either as a receiver of revenue (through taxation \nmainly) or a surveillance apparatus (through practices such as pass books). Rarely is \nthe colonial and imperial state written about as a consumer. In this article, the ‘Zulu \npoliceman’ is depicted as a surrogate embodiment of the state as consumer, since \nthe uniform that he wore was purchased by the state and its distribution regulated \nby the state’s policing departments. This does not mean a re-definition of the state as \n‘ornamentalist’,7 rather it requires a close analysis of the ways in which state institutions\nparticipated in the making of the Zulu policeman’s image. That is, it implies an \nexamination of the minutiae of colonial decision-making: the type of cloth that was \nused for the uniform, the choice of supplier or source, the design of the uniform itself \nand the dress codes to which policemen had to conform. \n The word ‘red’, given by Simon Gush and James Cairns as the title of their 2014 \ndocumentary,8 evokes many contemporary and historical metaphors and images: \nthe colour of blood, the promise of the sickle-and-hammer flag of the former Soviet \nUnion, danger, warning, and so on. When read through the history of mercenaries on \nthe Eastern Cape frontier, there is an obvious link to the fact that in Thomas Baines’s \npainting The Loyal Fingo, the main subject wears a red ‘do-rag’9 underneath his feathered\nhat. Ahead of him on the march is another mercenary who is also painted wear-\ning red headgear. In the 1990s, the internecine warfare that tore apart Gauteng’s East \nRand townships was accompanied in news reports by the shadowy figure of the ‘Zulu \nimpi’ wearing red bandanas. Thus, in that context, red became the colour of collaboration\nand third-force menace. Although the workers in the Mercedes-Benz manu-\nfacturing plant had other reasons for choosing red as the colour for Nelson Mandela’s \ncustom-made vehicle there is a sense in which this colour was already over-determined\nas a symbol of the end of the apartheid era and the start of democratic rule. \nWhen read historically, however, what emerges is an image of the mercenary and the \nfactory worker as ‘fabricators’ who were using colour as one of several components \nthat constituted the creation of an unauthorised ‘uniform’. In making a red Mercedes \nfor Mandela, the workers were deviating from the dark colours that are often used \nas the ‘status symbol’ of power and statesmanship. Similarly, when the Mfengu levies \nsewed their own clothes or purchased second-hand uniforms, they were deviating \nfrom the norms of military and police regulations in which colour is rank and synecdoche\n(where ‘Redcoats’ stands in for the whole British army). Thus, when positioned \nin relation to Simon Gush’s work – the documentary and the exhibition – Johnny \nFingo and the Zulu policeman represent an antecedent of uniforming, the enduring \n7 D. Cannadine, Ornamentalism: How the British Saw Their Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002).\n8 Simon Gush in collaboration with James Cairns, Red (film), 2014.\n9 The Oxford English Dictionary describes a ‘do-rag’ in the following terms: ‘Among African-Americans: a scarf or cloth worn on \nthe head to protect a processed hairstyle; (more generally) any close-fitting cloth worn on the head’ (‘do-rag, n.’. OED Online. \nSeptember 2016. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/249907?redirectedFrom=do+rag, last accessed \n10 November 2016). The concept of a ‘do-rag’ however precedes usage by African Americans since the Ethiopian Emperor \nMenelik II (1844-1913) was often photographed wearing a white cloth underneath a wide-brimmed hat. \n', '217 http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2309-9585/2016/v42a13 Kronos 42\npalette of which is later inadvertently referenced by the striking workers when they \nfabricate their own uniforms (and choose the colour of Mandela’s car).\n Granted, the ‘Zulu policeman’ is part of the colonial archive and thus similar to \nany other of the colonial subjects who were captured by the camera.10 The condensation\nof colonial subjects has served to make photographs of Zulu policemen collec-\ntors’ items and the stuff of military enthusiasts. The popular imagination11 was, and \ncontinues to be, fascinated by photographs of Zulu men in uniform. These images \nare frequently auctioned on websites or posted on blogs by self-identified amateur \nmilitary experts who routinely discuss the source, history and meaning of the photographs\nthey post. To excavate these photographs, therefore, also means accounting \nfor their continued monetary and nostalgic value.12 However, since a vast literature \nalready exists on African photography and its relationship to other aspects of African \nhistory, it is important to justify the relevance of Johnny Fingo by showing how he \nrelates to the extant body of literature.13\n To be clear, the basic link between the character of Johnny Fingo and the ‘Zulu \npoliceman’ is that the latter’s designation exists almost solely in the photographic \narchive so we can never be certain if Johnny Fingo was a real person.14 Therefore, the \nfirst thing to note about Johnny Fingo and his successor, the Zulu policeman, is that \nthey are both personae whose existence is mostly confirmed by artistic representation.\nThe second thing to know about the ‘Zulu Native Policeman’ is that he is pre-\nceded in history by a rabble of levies, regiments and mercenaries. This latter history \nis most emblematically represented in a painting by Thomas Baines – South Africa’s \nfather of landscape painting.15 Baines (1820–1875) was born in on 27 November \n1820, in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, England. In 1842, he travelled steerage to Cape \nTown where he began to practise his art commercially. In 1848, he joined an ox trek \nnorth to the Orange River and gained his first experience of travel into the interior, \nsketching and painting. In 1851, he enlisted as an artist with the British army in the \n‘Kaffir War’ (Cape Frontier War) of 1850–1853, before returning to England. The \n10 W. Hartmann, J. Silvester and P.

There are \nmany things to be noted about this depiction, but first it is important to briefly describe\nwho the ‘Fingoes’ (colonial name) or amaMfengu were. The identity of the \namaMfengu is linked to the controversy over the meaning of the ‘mfecane’ (the social\nand political upheaval caused by the rise of Shaka Zulu). Like many other eth-\nnic identities in southern Africa, the amaMfengu enter the scene of colonial conflict \nand encroachment as ‘refugees from Shaka’s wars’.16 In 1835, they supposedly signed \nan alliance treaty with Britain and, in exchange for land, Christian education and \nevangelisation, agreed to be the allies of the British against the Xhosa as the former\nextended the Cape Colony into the eastern Cape. Baines’s painting depicts an \nMfengu levy with a rifle slung over his shoulder with multiple objects of adornment \nand practical use on his person. For our purposes it is not the details that matter \nbut the very arbitrary and meddled quality of his attire. Without the rifle, there is \nnothing particularly militaristic about his apparel – the feathers in his hat, the genet \ntail and horn hanging from his waist all suggest sartorial choice rather than military \nregulation. This painting is pleasing to the eye because of its irregular combination of \nrugged practicality and spectacular dandyism. From the perspective of postcolonial \ntheory and the general criticism of colonial representation, this painting is fiction. It \nhas become the accepted position to read such paintings as fantastical, that is, to understand\nthem as being partly based on reality but mostly the products of the imagi-\nnation of the painter who is often depicted as eager to ‘exoticise’ his subjects while \npresenting the landscape as an idyll ready to be conquered and subjugated to Western \nindustry and cultivation. Baines fits into this stereotype of the colonial ‘amateur’ ethnographer.\nNot only did he paint and sketch scenes from his expeditions, but in 1854, \nvia his contacts in the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), he joined an expedition to \nNorthern Australia as artist and storekeeper. He returned once again to the Cape in \n1868, this time as ‘exploring superintendent and geographer’17 for the South African \nGoldfields Exploration Company, with prospecting sights on Matabeleland. The Loyal \nFingo cannot, therefore, be read as a visual reflection of the ‘liberty’ – to dress as they \npleased – that was enjoyed by African levies and mercenaries. Yet, for our purposes \nit is a starting point for a different kind of enquiry. If we accept the argument that \nthese kinds of paintings are not an accurate depiction of reality then the question \nthat logically follows is: what happens when the camera is introduced and colonial \narmies and police units are captured through the lens? In his essay, ‘Little History of \nPhotography’, Walter Benjamin warns against what he terms ‘the dubious project of \nauthenticating photography in terms of painting’.18 This article is not attempting such \ndubiousness. Rather, it is about the colonial transition from painting to photograph \nthat, as James Ryan argues in Picturing Empire, made photographs then and now the \n16 A.

He goes on to state that the assumed ‘exactitude of the camera’ could \nnot have emerged ‘without the pictorial conventions of perspectival realism that it \ninherited via landscape painting’.19 In the case of the Zulu policeman, the point is not \nonly to demonstrate this shift from painting to photography, but also to enumerate \nthe pictorial conventions which informed the creation of this archive of photographs \nand which now allow us to reconstruct elements of the ‘collective colonial memory’20 \nthat continues to animate these representations. \nThe Loyal Fingoes\nWhile Baines was painting Mfengu levies, a complementary war literature was taking\nshape as soldiers and officers wrote about their ‘frontier’ experiences. A different \npicture of the Mfengu emerges from this body of literature. To build on the supposition\nthat the Zulu policeman as a type is a direct descendant of the African levies that \nwere used by the Cape colonial government to fight ‘frontier wars’ in the nineteenth \ncentury, let us turn to Peires’s description of the events that precipitated the War of \nMlanjeni (1850–1853). In this description, Peires makes a passing observation about \nthe African ‘collaborators’ who defected and rebelled against the British and joined \nthe Xhosa in the fighting. He writes:\nMeanwhile the ‘Kaffir Police’, a paramilitary body of trained collaborators, \nrebelled against their white officers, and the Khoi settlers of the Kat River \nValley discarded their traditional alliance with the Colony to join the Xhosa \nin an all-out war against white domination in South Africa.21 \nThe existence of these ‘Kaffir Police’ hints at the use of collaborators of all kinds. \nSimilarly, the memoirs of white officers who fought in this war attest to the presence \nof African auxiliaries. Since what we are concerned with here is not the act of collaboration\nbut the clothing of the collaborators,22 it is apt to turn to a description of the \ndress style of the Mfengu levies found in the war journal of William Ross King. From \nhis description, we are given the impression that, on receiving their pay, Mfengu levies\nwould spend time and money purchasing clothing. He paid particular attention to \nthe varied and spectacular quality of their choices: \nIn town the young men get themselves up in the most extraordinary style, \nwith smart ear-rings in their ears, and school-boys’ caps stuck on the top of \ntheir heads, with red and blue velvet tassels; and you daily see them at the \nstores, laying out their pay in second-hand European clothes – blue coats \n19 Ryan, Picturing Empire, 16-17.\n20 Ibid, 12.\n21 J.

When they were doing battle, the levies also \nseemed to prefer European rifles, muskets and flintlocks rather than what would be \nexpected to be their preferred ‘traditional weapons’. The contrast is starkly drawn in \nthe following two excerpts: \nJust as the regiment was assembling for service in the centre of the camp, \non Sunday morning, we were startled by hideous yelling and cries from the \nFingoe camp, whereby the service was delayed for some time. For seeing the \nCommandant of the garrison galloping over, followed by other officers, one \nand all bolted after them to see what was going on, and found the Fingoes \nfighting about the division of rations. There were several hundreds of them \nstruggling like demons, in clouds of dust, yelling out their war-cry, and \nchallenging each other. All were perfectly naked, the blood running down \nthe black faces and breasts of many from the blows of ‘knobkerries,’ or clubs, \nwhich they applied to each other’s heads with such astounding force that the \nvery report was enough to give one a headache.25 \nJohnny26 Fingo, in his haste to shoot these poor devils, whom we had \nstealthily crept upon (having seen their camp-fire a long way off), forgot to \nput a cap on his rifle, and as the gun only snapped fire as he pulled the trigger,\nsome three or four feet from the head of one of the disputing maraud-\ners, he received in return a lounge [sic] from an assegai through his thigh. \nThe rest jumped suddenly up, and an indiscriminate mêlée took place. \nPoor Dix received a fearful crack on the skull from a knobkerrie (he was \nnever perfectly right afterwards); Johnny Fingo got another stab in the legs, \nand, what affected him still more, his beautiful ‘Westley-Richards’ doublebarrelled\nrifle, which he had obtained, Heaven knows how, was irretrievably \ndamaged.27 \nJohnny Fingo, as his hybrid name implies, was an Mfengu, who earlier in the text is \ndescribed as the ‘chief ’ of the levies. He functions in the second excerpt as the perfect \nembodiment of the African auxiliary. His singular concern for his ‘Westley-Richards’ \ndespite his injuries and despite his witnessing the use of the knobkerrie on his fellow\nsoldier, shows that, even as early in the nineteenth century as the 1850s, African \nlevies did not as a matter of practice only use knobkerries either for fighting or even \n25 Ibid., 42.\n26 The OED gives the following definition of Johnny: ‘…slang.

Johnny Fingo saw his power and authority as resting in his rifle \nand, as reported by Lakeman, ‘although badly wounded and unable to stand, was bemoaning\nhis broken rifle as it lay across his knees … he repeatedly asked me as to the \npossibility of getting the indented barrels of his rifle rebent to their original shape.’28 \n If Johnny Fingo and other African levies valued their rifles so much, why are \ntheir successors, the ‘Zulu policemen’, photographed holding knobkerries? One possible\nway to answer this question is by posing another. Writing about the end of the \n6th Frontier War of 1834–1835, Storey, in his book Guns, Race, and Power in Colonial \nSouth Africa, makes the following observation about Sir Harry Smith’s famous address\nto the Xhosa chiefs:\nThe establishment of civilization through commercialization and also \nthrough the undermining of the chiefs became established ‘native policy’ of \nthe Cape Colony. The overall policy remained in place for the remainder of \nthe nineteenth century. Yet where did guns fit in? Were they commodities \nthat, if exchanged and used, would tend to increase civilization? Or were \nthey objects that would be turned against the project of civilization?29 \nThere is also a direct answer to the question of whether guns were commodities and \nthat is that as the nineteenth century ended and African men acquired more guns, especially\nfrom working on the Kimberley diamond fields, successive colonial govern-\nments began to impose restrictions or even ban their ownership by Africans. To fuel \nthe present discussion concerning the amaMfengu and other ‘frontier Africans’ who \nallied with the British, it is important to begin by tracing the discourse of criminality \nwhich prompted the formation of policing and military units in the first place. To illustrate\nthe historical importance of African collaboration in colonial wars, Elizabeth \nElbourne’s description of the parlous condition of even those Africans who lived on \nmission stations and were not easily drawn into military service, is apt:\nIf the rewards of colonial collaboration seemed less secure by the 1840s, \ndespite the success of the Kat River settlement [a mission station], the \ncosts of military service were starkly apparent. The Kat River settlers, for \nexample, were conscripted into the colonial forces in 1835–36 and again in \n1846–47. This was despite the fact that the Khoekhoe-staffed Cape Corps \nalready made up the bulk of the troops stationed at the Cape Colony. First \nto be summoned and last to be released, the entire male population of Kat \nRiver between the ages of sixteen and sixty was called into service in the war \nof 1835–36.30 \n28 Ibid., 75.\n29 W.

Another answer to Storey’s question as to whether guns were commodities\nis found in the testimonies collected in the James Stuart Archive.

He returned to Natal \nin 1886, and after working in the post office in Pietermaritzburg, was appointed clerk to the resident magistrate of Eshowe in \nthe recently annexed British colony of Zululand in 1888. Stuart became a magistrate in Zululand in 1895, and subsequently \nat various centres in Natal. In 1909, he was appointed Assistant Secretary for Native Affairs, the second highest post in the \ncolony’s Native Affairs Department. In 1912, for reasons that are not clear, he retired at the age of 44, and returned to Natal. In \n1922, for reasons that again are not clear, he left Natal and settled in London where he lived until his death in 1942. J.

One of these informants, Mbovu ka Ndengezi, gave a pointed disquisition \non the meaning of money and its connection to government. It is worth quoting at \nlength:\nWas it not right to keep money from natives? Money was brought by \nEuropeans. We had none. Natives should not have been given money \nbecause they do not know its use. They should be paid in clothing and cattle.\nBut coolies, Arabs, and Chinese understand money. Let contracts exist \nbetween them. What is wanted from us is money. After we have worked, the \nmoney we earn is taken from us in every way. Our needs are increased and \nwe are pressed in every way. We then go out to work and wages are reduced. \nWe have our own necessities to meet. We would be content without money. \nWe will also work for hoes. Let pieces of paper be with Europeans…\nFigure 3: The above image is the original image based on which a vintage postcard found on \nthe Internet was created.

Our people cannot work; they have not been taught. \nThe great thing wanted of us is money. Although natives cannot [work], are \nnot used to work, they should work as far as they are able.\nThe Government built the country with money. Without money we would \nhave become cannibals…\nGovernment is expanding, every few years. The Government resembles \nTshaka, for he never got tired. Its army is money. \n… \n‘Natives will become criminals.’[italics in the original]32 \nThe anachronistic link between the colonial government and the reign of Shaka, suggests\na seamless transition from the military strategies and ambitions of the founder \nof the Zulu kingdom and the colonial government. However, other ‘ambitions’ are \nattributed to the state, namely, expansion and the spending of money. In Mbovu’s \nmind these are all connected to the fact that money, like an army, marches tirelessly \nin the name of its commanders. These statements could be dismissed as figurative \nbut they could also be taken seriously as pointing to the basic fact that colonial governments\ndid spend money on both the expansion of state power and the expan-\nsion of military capacity. Moreover, Mbovu insightfully connects policing with the \npresence of money; he observes that without money there would be no crime and \ntherefore no criminalisation of Africans. From his perspective, the ‘Zulu Policeman’ \nis exactly a functionary of the state because he is part of the army that is constituted \nwith money. \n This consumptive function of the state can also be discerned in the history of \npolicing in Natal, where most of the photographs of Zulu policemen were taken. One \nof the most thorough sources on the establishment of policing as a profession is H.P. \nHolt’s The Mounted Police of Natal.33 Not only does this book detail the history of \nNatal’s first police force, it is also dedicated and prefaced by Major-General Sir J.G. \nDartnell, K.C.B the founder of the policing corps. An excerpt from his preface gives \nus a sense of what considerations, compromises and exigencies influenced the creation\nof a colonial police unit. On the character and quality of colonists available for \nrecruitment Major Dartnell writes:\n32 C. de B. Webb and J. B.

And Major Dartnell writes:\nThe clothing was at first the same as that worn by the Frontier Armed and \nMounted Police, viz., brown corduroy jacket and breeches, black leather \nboots coming nearly to the knee and buckled down the side, and a leather \npeaked cap with a white cover. It was a stinking uniform, however, which \ncaused the men to be nicknamed ‘The Snuffs’,35 but anything in the shape \nof uniform was hard to get in the colony at the time. Afterwards, as more \nsuitable uniform was obtained, the men began to put on a little ‘side’ when \nwalking out, and the then Governor said to me one day: ‘Your men swagger \ntoo much. We don’t want swashbucklers.’ To that I replied: ‘If you knew the \ndifficulty I have had to make them forget the name of “Snuffs” and instil a \nlittle swagger into them, you wouldn’t wish to see it reduced.’\nA little later on another Governor said, with reference to his orderly at \nGovernment House: ‘I wish you wouldn’t send a prince in disguise as my \norderly, for he looks so spick and span that I am almost ashamed of my own \nget-up whenever I pass him.’ \nThese two quotes point to the obvious relationship that exists between a uniform \nand behaviour – the ‘flotsam and jetsam’ of the colony is transformed into princely \ncountenance by an appropriate and socially accepted uniform. Beyond this obvious \n‘functionalization’36 of the uniforms, as Roland Barthes would put it, the statement \nalso tells us something about the pedigree of the Corps – it borrowed its uniform \nfrom the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. In his preface, the Major-General \ndescribes how when appointed to his position he had requested permission to travel \nto the Cape Colony to ‘learn something of police work, for they had had a mounted \npolice force there for some few years’.37 This lineage of one colonial force copying or \nlearning from another elucidates how notions of proper dress travelled from place \n34 Ibid., viii.\n35 One of the meanings of the word snuff is: ‘To detect, perceive, or anticipate, by inhaling the odour of ’ (OED). The pun being \nmade here is that the uniform was so smelly that the police could be snuffed from a distance. \n36 In his influential and seminal book, The Language of Fashion, Roland Barthes makes the following observation about clothing: \n‘Outside of the leisured classes, dress is never linked to the work experienced by the wearer: the whole problem of how clothes \nare functionalized is ignored.’ Roland Barthes, The Language of Fashion, ed.

Or, expressed differently, Mbovu’s assertions that the government’s army is \nconstituted of money are embodied in the ‘swagger’ that officers would adopt once \nthey were dressed in their uniforms. Thus, the uniform can be understood as the \nembodiment of the government’s ability to create and spend money. \n The economic imperative of recruiting, clothing and paying policemen took \non a different meaning with the large-scale urbanisation of the African population. \nFrom this perspective, these photographs could be understood to complement another\nkind of archive – namely, the archive of military dispatches and letters that \ndefined why and how Zulu men were specifically recruited for military and policing \nservice. For example, a letter from the Superintendent of Native Affairs, J. Marwick, \nstamped 30 November 1900, bemoans the fact that only 20 Africans are employed in \npolicing the ‘locations’ of Pretoria. The letter is addressed to the Military Governor \nand states:\nHaving regard to the fact that there are – including Government labourers, \nabout 7 000 working Natives alone in Pretoria – not to speak of the families \nin the Locations – I think the number of Native Police employed is not in \nexcess of present requirements.\nNative Constables – provided they be without local interests – are much \nmore useful in policing people of their own colour than European police \ncould be. In addition to keeping the Native population under proper control\nthey have means of obtaining information which are not afforded to \nEuropean Police.\nThe proposal to fix the strength of Native Police for Pretoria at 20 only \nshould not be approved. Even in time of peace sixty, at the very least, would \nbe required.\nThis letter shifts the attention away from the uniforms and dress of African policemen\ntowards the ‘function’ they were meant to serve while in uniform. It clearly dis-\ntinguishes the ‘Native Police’ from the ‘European Police’ by suggesting that the Native \npoliceman has skills of investigation and interrogation that are not available to the \nEuropean. Moreover, Superintendent Marwick accidentally points to one of the characteristics\nthat was necessary for the making of the appropriate ‘Native Constable’: \nhe was to ‘be without local interests’, meaning that he could not be from the urban \nlocation itself. He had to be from elsewhere. As the photographic archive attests, this \nelsewhere was Natal or Zululand. \n The other function that is being defined here is that of ‘proper control’ – the Native \npoliceman is not patrolling Pretoria’s urban locations in order to ‘keep the peace’ or \nensure the safety of the denizens. He is there to keep the ‘population under proper \ncontrol’. This placed the policeman in direct confrontation with urbanised Africans, \nespecially the urban elite who chafed against the constant supervision and surveillance \n', '228 http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2309-9585/2016/v42a13 Kronos 42\nenacted by policemen. In 1911, Sol Plaatje38 published an article in the Pretoria News \ntitled ‘The Amalaita Bands: Some Criticism of the Native Police’ in which he painted a \ndifferent portrait of the character and behaviour of the Native Police:\nFor a picture of the average Zulu policeman at Johannesburg I would depict \nthis; A creature, giant-like and large as to proportions, ferocious and forbidding\nof aspect, most callously brutal of action, and irredeemably igno-\nrant. The knowledge that it is but necessary to call attention of the higher \npolice officials to this matter to obtain remedy, and that there is no more \nkindly, courteous and humane gentleman anywhere than is Major Douglass, \nDeputy Commissioner, induces me to devote a short chapter to this subject \nin the sincere belief and hope that it will not be in vain.39 \nThis caricature of the boorish and ignorant Zulu Policeman points to a literary history\nof these servicemen. The fact that Plaatje – a member of the nineteenth-century \nblack elite and a man of letters – dedicated an article to the problem of urban criminal\ngangs (the Amalaita) and ineffectual policing by African policemen, suggests \nthat there were many more such complaints. From Plaatje’s perspective, the ‘Native \nPolice’ were not actually keeping the black population under control (their key role, \nas defined by the 1900 letter) but were in fact negligent in their duty since they did \nnot prevent or arrest the growth and violence of the Amalaita gangs. Still, beyond \nthis grievance, another relationship is being defined here. Plaatje, and by implication \nother educated Africans, saw the Zulu policeman not as a compatriot or civil servant \nbut as a nemesis. This antagonistic relationship between educated Africans and the \nignoble Zulu policeman contradicts the swaggering image depicted by the founder \nof Natal’s police force, since for the African elite the Zulu policeman was clumsy \nand incompetent, and certainly not a ‘prince in disguise’. As a literary theme this \nantagonistic relationship offers us the opportunity to define the position of African \npolicemen in the emerging class structure of urban South Africa. Moreover, it seems \nthat the police force or forces also published their own journal or magazine from \n1907 onwards. This publication was originally called Nongqai – the Zulu word for \na ‘night watchman’ or security guard – and was then changed in 1979 to the Latin \nname Servamus (meaning ‘to serve’). The fact that police officers founded their own \njournal, which wasn’t principally concerned with policing and security issues but \nwas, rather, a literary and ‘human interest’ magazine, suggests that while educated \n38 Solomon Plaatje (1876–1932) was a journalist, linguist, author, and early member of the African National Congress. He \nbecame a government clerk and an interpreter; and spoke several vernacular languages as well as English, Dutch, Afrikaans, \nand German. During the South African War (1899–1902) he worked for the British, and his vivid diary of the Siege of \nMafeking, written in a school exercise book, was discovered many years after his death. He founded several newspapers that \ndefended African rights against white rule. His book, Native Life in South Africa (1916), appealed for British help against South \nAfrican government policies. In 1919, he was a member of a South African Native National Congress delegation to London \nthat failed to get African interests discussed at the Versailles Peace Conference. Plaatje wrote poetry and translated several \nShakespeare plays into Tswana. He also wrote Mhudi (1930), one of the first novels to be written by an African.\n39 S. T. Plaatje, ‘The Amalaita Bands: Some Criticism of the Native Police,’ English in Africa, 3, 2, 1976, 59.\n', '229 http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2309-9585/2016/v42a13 Kronos 42\nAfricans had their own views and complaints about the police; the police in turn \nevolved their own literary response to the public’s contempt.40\n Although the gap that exists between the official version of what a policeman \nshould have been and the African elite’s contempt for Zulu policemen cannot be \nbridged, there are nonetheless reasons to think the photographer’s camera offers us \na third and alternative perspective. To illustrate the point about the different ways in \nwhich value was attached to photographs of Zulu policemen, two photographs will \nsuffice as examples. The first photograph comes from a family album housed in the \nNational Library of South Africa archives in Cape Town. The catalogue entry and \ndescription attached reads: ‘“Sgt X, Zulu Police Man” – Barefoot Man In Uniform In \nStudio Setting / Middlebrook, JE, Durban’. The fact that this is a studio photograph and \nwas possibly taken with the consent and willingness of the subject does not diminish \nthe fact that he is still anonymous and part of another person or family’s photographic\narchive. By contrast, a second photograph exemplifies the commercialisation of \nthe ‘Zulu Policeman’ as an exotic imperial subject. This photograph, which was being \nauctioned on a website, is mostly described by its dimensions: ‘Age: Vintage original \nold postcard Approx. Size: 5.5 X 3.5 inches (14 X 9 cm)’. The most noticeable aspect \nof the photograph is the tint or archival hue which has turned what might otherwise \nhave been just another photograph of an African man in uniform into a product that \ncan be sold today as ‘vintage’. These portraits of ‘Zulu Native Policemen’ confirm the \nphysical stature of these men attesting to why members of the African elite were often \nso resentful of their presence and their seemingly arbitrary power. Even the literature \non the history of dress and clothing in South Africa is biased towards the African elite \nsince it often reinforces the idea that only the ‘educated’ wore Western clothing. Two \nconcepts – ‘status’ and ‘respectability’ – form the foundation of Robert Ross’s book \nStatus and Respectability in the Cape Colony, 1750–1870: A Tragedy of Manners.41 \nAlthough it is a wide-ranging book covering the Dutch and British periods of rule at \nthe Cape, Ross mostly tracks the ascendancy of mission-inspired notions of gentility \nand social and moral rectitude. He rarely touches upon the sartorial and moral codes \nof those who were not aspiring for incorporation into colonial society. The necessity \nto study the dress styles and choices of the ‘underclasses’ is, as already noted, eloquently\njustified in the work of Roland Barthes.42 However, Barthes offers his state-\nments as a critique of the histories of dress in Europe and America. The histories \nof dress in Africa and other parts of the non-Western world are not necessarily included\nin his argument. The accepted assumption is that southern Africa’s indigenous \npeople wore, purchased and made Western-style clothes as part of the process of \nWesternisation and embourgeoisment.43 Johnny Fingo and the Zulu Policeman do not \nnecessarily challenge this scholarly assumption; instead, they demonstrate that the \n40 For examples of some of the articles published in Nongqai see: http://www.esaach.org.za/index.php?title=Zulu_Literature, last \naccessed 3 December 2016.\n41 R.

As Mary Barker’s epigraph on the ‘cast-off clothes of all the armies of Europe’ \ncues us, there was a popular cultural uptake of military uniforms that cannot be explained\nsimply by reference to a specific war. More importantly, even in the realm \nof the sacred, the uniforms chosen by churches such as Isaiah Shembe’s Nazarites \nexhibit strong military and colonial metaphor and imaging. As Papini notes, it is \nnot just loss or victory that prompts an appropriation of military uniforms and insignia;\nit is the ‘theatre of war’ that supplies the images.44 In the case of the striking \nworkers at the Mercedes-Benz plant, the construction of strike uniforms may be said \nto belong to this long line of ‘uniformication’ that has animated collective identities \nand quotidian activities alike. So whether it is ‘Societies’ (collective banking associations)\nor women’s Umanyano (mothers’ church unions), there exists a wealth of such \nfabricated identities. The tendency is to read such uniforms as forms of resistance. \nHowever, in the case of Johnny Fingo and the Zulu Policeman a concept such as resistance\nmay not be sufficient to encapsulate the layered and contradictory valences of \ndress, attire, accessory and ammunition. The assumption tends to be that, because of \ntheir association with the colonial state’s repressive tools, these policemen and mercenaries\nwere either coerced or duped. The possibility that they were aware of their \nunsavoury function and therefore dressed accordingly, is not generally considered. \nIn the same way that the striking workers who created the uniforms could be said to \nhave been expressing the ‘excess’ they saw daily at the factory – that is, the availability \nof unused material – Johnny Fingo and the Zulu Policeman may symbolically represent\nthe excesses of the colonial state. For one, when Mfengu levies used their pay to \npurchase decommissioned uniforms, they were at once signalling their ‘equality’ with \ntheir white officers, while at the same time mimicking or mocking the hierarchical \ncommand structure of the military. They were therefore resisting their subalternity \n(since they were not commonly recognised as ‘soldiers’), while at the same time demonstrating\ntheir capacity to ‘play the part’ they were denied. \n Although this article is concerned with Johnny Fingo, he is not an exception. \nThere are multiple Johnny Fingoes whose visually documented presence could be \ndated as preceding the unification of South Africa as a country in 1910, and who could \nform part of a larger study of the material culture of South Africa. A focus on material \nculture opens up many possibilities notwithstanding an awareness that the history \nof photography, especially in the colonised world, is a well traversed area of study \n44 R. Papini, ‘The Nazareth Scotch: Dance Uniform as Admonitory Infrapolitics for an Eikonic Zion City in Early Union Natal.’ \nSouthern African Humanities, 14, December 2002, 90.\n', '231 http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2309-9585/2016/v42a13 Kronos 42\non its own. As James Ryan observes, in his book Picturing Empire: Photography and \nthe Visualization of the British Empire, ‘Britain’s Empire, like much in the Victorian \nage, had the atmosphere and aesthetic charge of a grand spectacle’.45 By drawing such \na link between the political, economic and expansionist ambitions of Empire with \nthe problems of aesthetics and ‘taste’, Ryan makes it clear that the visual material \nproduced during colonial times is as much a part of imperial history as it is African \nhistory. This article is an attempt to situate the ‘Fingo’ levies and photographs of Zulu \npolicemen within the larger archive of imperial photography. It offers a nuanced exposition\nof how the ‘grand spectacle’ of the painting and photographs discussed was \nachieved through the convergence of state expenditure and the recording presence of \nthe camera and/or the artist. However, unlike photographs of ‘respectable’ Africans \n– the Griqua Wedding Party on the cover of Robert Ross’s Status and Respectability \nin the Cape Colony, 1750–1870, for example – the Zulu policeman (and his predecessors)\nis a figure of ambivalence rather than one that embodies the triumph of the \ncivilising mission. \n45 Ryan, Picturing Empire, 15.\n']</pre>
