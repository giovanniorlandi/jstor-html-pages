T. Young at Ville i\'\nPlate, in this parish, on Oct. 4th. c\nThe case attracted considerable P\nattention owing to the prominence Il\nof the parties connected with the n\ntragedy and the Courtroom was e\ncrowded with interested specta- -\ntors throughout the proceedings. if\nThe evidence adduced at the a\nhearing was somewhat at variance a\nwith the reports circulated on the t\nstreets here immediately after the n\nkilling, as is usually the case in n\nsuch matters, it having been com- o\nmonly reported that only one of t\nthe accused did the shooting, ri\nwhile they admitted at the hearing r\nthat both emptied their pistols at F\nthe deceased. It was also claimed t\nthat Dr. Young had only been F\nfired on from the front, while the I\ntestimony of the coroner would v\nindicate that he was wounded in i\nboth the left and right sides and t\nin the back. There .was no eye- 1\nwitnesses to the killing, and other t\nthan the statements of the accus- t\ned themselves there was no testi\nmony given covering the actual\noccurrence. The Thompson boys\nare pleading self-defence, and\nfrom their version of the affair y\ntheir position is not regarded as @\nbeing so serious as at first sup- e\nposed, and the lack. of eye wit\nness to the -deed made it well 2\nnigh impossible for the State to f\ncontradict their statements, yet\nif there was no premeditated f\ncriminal intent, their conduct re- f\nvealed much indiscretion to say I\nthe least.\nAs we go to press Friday eve- f\nning the case had not yet closed. i\nFarmers should have their eyes I\nwide open just now. Without it\nbeing apparent there is a big\nfight on hand as to prices for the\npresent cotton crop. The gov\nernment report makes it very\nclear that the crop cannot exceed\nvery much 10,000,000 bales which\nshould cause the cotton to sell at\nsomewhere around twelve cents.\nThe spinners will refuse to buy\nat that price but this will last only\na few weeks. When it is clearly\nknown that the crop is a very\nshort one, and this will be the\ncase in less than a month, there\nwill be a rush to buy and prices\nwill jump to at least three or four\ncents above what is now obtained.\n3 - af - -\nSince our last report there has\nbeen a steady improvement in the\nyellow fever situation throughout\nthe State. Thursday\'s Picayune\nsurminarizes the conditions for the\nprevious 24 hours as follows:\nNew Orleans, new cases 5; deaths,\n0; new foci, 2. EThe only news\nin the fever situation yesterday\nwas the low record. Country re\nports were: Kenner, 2 and 1\ndeath; near Plattenville, 1 death;\nPatterson, 2; near Lafayette, 3;\nCheniere Caminada, 2 deaths;\nnew cases there and at Grand\nIsle; Lake Providence, 2; Baton\nRouge, 1 slispcious.

It will be ready for\nservice at all times. Whenever\na case of yellow fever, or other\ninfectious\' disease, reaches the\npity the patient will be. at once\niselated and systematically cared\nfor by e pert physicians, with the\nhope of etampingout the disease.\niOp 1... has had such an in\ntutione for years, and it has\nproven an important factor in\ning the town free from in\nfi a diseases.\n"There is now talk of a. rail\nwa rate bill that will not meet\noIppositi i n iongress," says a\no gtemorary.

The home\npaper is distinctly the farmer\'s\nown paper, supported directly or\nindirectly by the farmers who\ncompose the backbone of the\nprinter\'s subscription list, -and\nlargely for what the enterprising\nmerchant advertises. Now, broth\ners, let us not forget our friends.\nLet us see that our subscription\nis paid before the first of January,\nand a year in advance if we can\nafford it. The man or the paper\nthat fights my battles shall have\nmy support. Another thing, the\nmerchants who advertise are the\nones who makes it possible for us\nto get a good local paper; and the\nmen or firm who are too penu\nrious to advertise and help sup\nport the local press have no right\nto the farmers\' patronage. I\npropose hereafter to go to a good,\nlive local advertiser, and a man\nwho will do his share in support\ning the local press, thus contribu\nting to my support, rather than\nbuy of the man who proposes to\ntake all and give nothing in re\nturn."\n-4*4e-·H-----\nLetter to Louis Bihm.\nOPELOUSAS.\nDear Sir: have you found-out\nyou can paint a job with fewer\ngallons Devoe than of anything\nelse, lead-end-oil or anything else?\nMr. Floyd Almy, House and\nSign Painter, Greenwich, N.

To f\nwalk along the streets of a city and see ii\nthe poor deformed creatures who go i\nthrougl& liife.with a shriveled limb, or t\nperhl"s all arm as well as a leg,. l- t\nways causes an Involuntary feeling of 0\npity to come over even the most care\nless and thoughtless. When one real- I\nizes at the same time that much b1 the\ntrouble might have been overcome un- o\nc!er proper treatment while the suf- I\nferer was still young, the sympathy c\nfor the unfortunate is mingled wi\'h 4\nresentment against those who had the r\ncare of the case or even :,gi:nst lhI r\nparents for not making -more stren- I\nuons efforts to correct the weakness. I\nIgnorance, yes. plain language I ad\nInit, but a fact nevertheless. and I e\ntrust that it may be no longer the 1\'\nplea. Many cases of infantile paraly\nsis, yes, the nmajority of them. arise r\nfrom". over-feeding, indigestion and con- c\nst\'paltio. Of the three causes or colu\nbination of causes, that of constipa- I\ntion is the greatest factor. As I stated\nin previous ,art!cles. constipation as it I\nshould be considered Is not alone a f\ntorpid condition of tile bowels, but\nconsists of inactivity in all of the or- I\nguns of elimination, liver, kidneys and a\nsweat glands of the skin. All of the s\nwa::te or refuse matter of the system I\nmust be elimina;ed or a poisoning of iI\nthe blood follows--auto intoxication. a\nPerhaps I need not say. much more }\nabout that part of it. Health Culture I\nfor August has an excellent article a\nupon that subject.\nTo prevent\'Itnfantile paralysis be cer- i\ntain that your children have good, N\nwholesome food, and that they imasti- 3\ncate It well.

See I\nthat they drink plenty of pure water t\nbetween nteals and have fresh fruits as v\noften as possible and plenty of it. r\nThen constipation is not at all likely c\nto trouble them. t\nif the condition already exists, see c\nthat these matters are attended to at a\nonce and in. addition to the proper c\ndiet and other rules to observe, see t\nthat the child has proper treatment I\nfrom the most skilful osteopath or I\nSwedish movement manipulator that t\nyou can secure, yourself applying the r\nhot and cold water treatments that .\nhave been described in the lectures s\non Hydrotherapy. c\nI shall not soon forget Bessie, a little\ngirl that was brought to me several t\nyears ago.

Reeder, Laporte, Ind.:\nDear Doctor-I awn a rnader of thi\npublication, and I see the offer of yout\nfree advice to its r.ad\'r..\nI have a son ecight years old who is,\nI believe, troubled with catarrh and\nalso enlarged tonsils. He does not\nseem to have any trouble with his\nbreathing while awake, but at night\nhis nostrils seems to stop up, and while\nasleep throws his head far back. His\ngeneral health is good, and always has\nbeen, with the exception of three years\nago he had a stroke of infantile paraly\nsis, which left him partially paralyzed\nin his left foot.. Any advice would be\nvery much appreciated. Respectfully\nyours. A. A.\n1V\'hilia most neomm.e would consider\nthis case almost identical with that of\nH. K., of Dauphin, yet the fact that\nthe greatest difficulty Is experienced\nwhile lying dowin would indicate a\ngrowth in the nostrils or polypus, a sort\nof sack or bag of the mucous mem\nbrane caused by weakencd tissues,\noriginating perhaps in the catarrh. If,\nas you suggest. the cause is wholly one\nof catarrh, it could be cured by the\nuse of the method described in the\nHome Health Club Book of Lectures.\nBut I suspect that it is not wholly due\nto catarrh, but, as I stated before, to\npolypus. In order to cure this, it is\n..ecessary to supply an element to the\nsystem which is lacking, and which\ncauses the weakness of the mucous\nmembranes. This can be done by the\nuse of the tissue elements or cell salts,\nalthough the usual method of treat\nment is to cauterize or snare and pull\nthem out, a practice which I consider\nbrutal and unfwarranted. Supply the\nlacking tissue elements, either through\nthe food or direct, and a cure will fol\nlow.\nIn regard to the lameness of his left\nfoot you should carefully read to-day\'s\nlecture and follow the directions there\nin given, and I believe the lameness\nwill disappear.\nAll readers of this publication are\nat liberty to write for any informa\ntion pertaining to the subject of health.\nAddress all communications to the\nHome Health Club, or to Dr. David H.\nReeder, Laporte, Ind., with name and\naddress in full and with at least four\ncents in postage.\nBreton Folklore,.\nA collections of Breton popular su\nperstitions-those harmless after re\ntieetions of a remote pre-Christian an\ntiquity-has just been published, and\nvery amusing some of these beliefs are.\nThus, a matron curious -to "count her\nchickens before they were hatched."\nputs a hair through her wedding riig,\nwhich she plunges in a glass of water,\nand as often as it knocks against the\nidlo so many are the number of her\nfuture olive branches.

The Vienna fire\ndepartment is considered the best\nequipped of Continental Europe, and\nwithin ten years it has replaced all\nobsolete apparatus with the most mod\nern and useful devices. The first step\ntaken was the ordering of fifty-three\nmotor- chemical engines and wagons\nto replace those previously drawn by\nhorses, and which are most useful for\ndealing with small fires. When this\nhis been complished, the horse\nd.lawII steam fire engines and the ex\ntension ladders will be changed or\nreplaced in some way not as yet deter\nmined.

In the\nrapidity and the iardness of its\ng.;ow\':l this tree has no equal. Five\nyears from the time of planting\ngraves raised from: seedlings will\nyield 75 cords of stove wood an acre.\nThree to five years from the time of\ncutting sprouts that spring from the\nstumps mature into trees that produce\nmore cords to the acre than the or.\niginal growth. Rep.-atcd cuttings add\nto the thriftiness of the eucalyptus.\nA period of 25 years will develop\ntrees the size of oaks known to be\n300 years old. In some sectici\nnearly exhausted as fuel the eucalyp\ntus is taking its place.\nSome varieties thrive in tropical\nswamps. Others flourish in the moun\ntain snows far above the timber line.\nTo every degree of climate and con\ndition between these extremes some\nspecies from this prolific genus is\nadapted. Scientists have demonstrat\ned that eucalyptus has a wonderful\neffect upon climate. From some of\nthe swampy ar.:as of Italy malaria has\nbeen banished by the growth of the\neucalyptus groves. \'This is due both\nto the tonic and m.edical effects of its\naroma and tihe tree\'s phenomenal\ncapacity for absorbing water.\nNetwithstanding the latter trait,\nhowever, some varieties of the blue\ngum will thrive on arid plains. Soil\non which not even <actus will live will\nproduce great eucalyptus trees.\nThe genus is invaluable as a source\nof timber. The uses it is put to in\nthis regard are amazingly diverse. In\nAustralia it is used extensively in the\nconstruction of ships, buildings,\nbridges, vehicles, agricultural imple\nments, furniture, barrels and hun\ndreds of minor articles.\nFaultless hardwood logs over 200\nfeet long, 120 feet in diameter at the\ntop and, 30 feet in diameter at the\nbase are hewn from giant e::colyptus.\nIt is one of the most durable of hard\nwoods. This is a remarkable fact\nwhen the celerity of its growth is con,\nsidered. In repairing a decayed pier\nat Santa Barbara, Cal., it was found\nthat a few piles were perfectly sound.\nExamination discloced ti-at they had\n-been hewn from eucalyptus trees.\nMaxwell\'s Talisman.\nA Bat in Church.\nAt a recent and well-attended reli\ngious service in this city on a hot\nevening, a bat ariad the interest of\nthe occasion by flying about the room\nmuch of the time, occasionally in em\nbarrassing proximity to the bewilder\ning beauties of the millinery art. It\nappeared to enjoy good society, as it\nmade no effort to escape through the\nopen windows on either side of the\nroom. Two or three times it alighted\non the wall and listened attentively,\napparently resting as eas:ly upon its\nperpendicular seat as though it were\nupon the- floor. A fewof the sitters\nwere very nervous, and regarded the\nbat as an unwelcome intruder-a dark\nportent of evil. Others, more optimis\ntic, looked upon it as a reincarnation,\na glorified mouse, having won its\nwings by unfailing rectitude on the\nlower plane of its animal life.

One of them, says the Brooklyn\nEagle, told of a discovery by a Nippur\nexpedition of the University of Penn\nsylvania-a well-preserved and thor\noughly authenticated tailor\'s bill\nnearly five thousand years old.\nSince the man who was holding on\nto the next strap is himself engaged in\nthe clothing business the man with\nthe newspaper thought the item would\ninterest him, so he read it aloud to\nhim; but the story left the listener\nwith a blank look on his face.\n"Don\'t you understand?" said the\nother, impatiently.

He later became\nthe junior member of the well-known\nfirm of Pepin & Broussard, of thatcity.\n\'The sedentary life of the city under\nmimed his health, and when success in\nbusiness had secured for him a high\nplace there, he was forced to return to\nthe country, to the scenes of his early\nlife. Here his health improved, the ac\ntive pursuits engaged in being more\ncongenial. He served as Sheriff of St.\nMartin parish for four years and later\nbecame its tax collector, rendering effl\ncient services in both capacities. Hie\nwas a charter menmber of Alcibiades De\niBlan Camp, U. C. V., and held the rank\nof Major on the staff of the general\ncoemmanding, almost every living mem\nber of his old company being present at\nhis funeral to attest to the esteem in\nwhich they held him. He was likewise\na charter member of the Knights of\nHonor Lodge, the entire membership\nacting with his late comrades in arms\nas an escort during the ceremonies.\nThe great number who attended the\nfuneral was the most eloquent tribute\nthat could have been offered to his\nmemory. No man enjoyed the confi\ndence and esteem of his fellow-citizens\nto a greater degree than the subject of\nthis sketch. He was a gallant soldier,\na good man, a true friend, and a de\nvoted husband and father. He isesur\nvived by his wife and eight children,\nall of whom have reached, or nearly\nreached, their majority. His eldest\nson, J. G. Broussard, is in business at\nSt. Martinville, another son, James F.\nBroussard, is a professor at the Louisi\nana State University, and T. W. Brous\nsard, now located at Nachitoches, was\nin business here for some time. His\neldest daughter is the wife of William\nJ. Seados, of Opelousas, the other hav-\'\ning married Dr. Albert P. Voorhies,\nnow of El Paso, Tex.

T. Young\ndepsated from this life at the age of 56\nyears and six months. lHe was born\nMarch 28,1849, at Plaquemine Ridge, in\nSt. Landry Parish, and was the 4th\nchild of Madison Young and Mary Ann\nRichard, both deceased, the latter pre\nceeded her doctor son by fifteen months.\nDr. Young\'s early schooling was ob\ntained in St. Landry\'s renowned old in\nstitution, The Franklin College, located\nat Opelousas. lie then entered the\nmedical department of the University\nof Louisiana at New Olleans, now Tu\nlane University, graduating with dis\ntinction from that institution in the\nspring of 1872.\nHe first began his professional career\non Bayou Boeuf, soon afterwards re\nmoving to Ville Plate, then a little vil\nlage far out in the primitive encom\npassed by broad prairies and the gr adual\nprairie swells that gave it its character\nistic name.\nAs a medical practitioner he soon won\nthe faith and confidence of his people,\nand in time came to enjoy a most Ilcra\ntive and ideal country practice.\nAt the age of 30 he married Miss\nValentine P. Archinard of Alexandria,\nLa., who died some years afterwards,\nleaving the Doctor with a single off\nspIing, Z. T., Jr., who lives to-day and\nwho is on the eve of his majority and a\npromising career of success and useful\nness.\nl)r. Young mingled in politics at\nvarious periods in his life. lle was a\nlegislator in the house of representa\ntives once, caroner of St. Landry par\nish, later deputy coroner; candidate for\nsheriff; and again candidate for the\ncoroners office.\nHis private life was a strange admix- I\nture of sunshine and cloud, success and\ndisappointment, linut through it all lie I\nwas gonerous-a beau idol of generosi\nty. Of the Cardinal virtues charity is I\nfirst, and hl was charitable to a fault.\nHis home was tlie sheltering refuge of\nthe wanderer and belated. His hospi- I\ntality extendedl to tIlhe wealthy pros- I\nipetor and belated stranger as well as I\nthe night overtaken laymen, among the\nlatter of whom Ihe found his truest -\nfriends and staunchest supporters. 2\nHis houme was the happy meeting\nplace of grand-mnother, children and I\ngrand-children, and delightful memio\nries still cling around that sacred gath- t\nering place-memories akin to an af- I\nfectionate worship. I\nDr. Young was, in the stiact sense of I\nthe word, a self-made man. His strug. t\ngle for an education against the un- t\nfortunate circumstances that combined t\nto crush out every vestige of ambition, c\nwas wonderful, superhuman. Among I\nthe thottsauds of Southern planters\nwhose lands had been desolated and\nhomes dismantled by the ravagings of\nwar,was that of Madison Young, father ,\nof our subject. When Dr. Young re- ii\nceived his hard earned medical degree v\nfrom the old University of Louisiana, v\na mere stsippling, beardless boy, lie f\nturned to face tihe exigencies of real\nlife with a widowed mother, a widowed i\nsister and a helpless little brother and f,\nsister dependant upon him for a sup- d\nport. Notwithstanding these encum\nbrances and his humble beginning he it\nwas accounted at his death one of the u\nindependently rich men of St. Landry. a\nHe was not ovly a student of medi\ncine but a student of the civil and so\ncial conditions of men. His profession\noften brought him into the humble\nhomes of poverty and distress-the a\nhomes of those wiro truly live the sim- f\nple life. These experiences gave to his a\npublic as well as private life a philan- o\nthrophic tendency marking him for the b\nslings and arrows of unrighteous poli- -p\ncal enemies. 1\n"Did I know him in life? Yes, as k\nbrother knows brother. I knew him in\nand loved him, t\'was all I could give."\nI knew him best as a child knows a h\nfather, and happy was I when I could si\nbe with him in his quiet hours of re- c\ntrospection and learn of those things\nand conditions of which his wide ex- S\nperience and close observation had I\nmade him so accurately familiar.\nHe leaves behind him three brothers\nand two sisters, all heads of families,\nbeside many other relatives in St. Lan\ndry parish and elsewhere. His remains\nwere interred in the Catholic cemetery h\nat Church Point by those of his sister\nand mother who had only shortly ple\nceeden him, to use his own favorite 0\nquotations, "to that undiscovered coun- i\ntry, from whose bourn no traveler re\nturns.\') .\nWith generous heart he freely gave\nTo the poorly clad, unshod-\nAround his faults let charity cling, I\nWhile we cover him with the sod.\nONE WHO KNEW HIM.\nDon\'t Borrow Trouble.\nIt is a bad habit to borrow anything,\nbut the worst thing you can possibly\nborrow, is trouble.
