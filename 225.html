A database of lightning-related fatalities and injuries\nin Turkey was constructed by collecting data from the\nTurkish State Meteorological Service, newspaper archives,\nEuropean Severe Weather Database, and the internet. The\ndatabase covers January 1930 to June 2014. In total, 742\nlightning incidents causing human fatalities and injuries were\nfound. Within these 742 incidents, there were 895 fatalities,\n149 serious injuries, and 535 other injuries. Most of the incidents\n(89 %) occurred during April through September, with\na peak in May and June (26 and 28 %) followed by July\n(14 %). Lightning-related fatalities and injuries were most\nfrequent in the afternoon. Most of the incidents (86 %) occurred\nin rural areas, with only 14 % in the urban areas. Ap-\nproximately, two thirds of the victims with known gender\nwere male. Because of the unrepresentativeness of the historical\ndata, determining an average mortality rate over a long\nperiod is not possible. Nevertheless, there were 31 fatalities\n(0.42 per million) in 2012, 26 fatalities (0.35 per million) in\n2013, and 25 fatalities (0.34 per million) in 2014 (as of June).\nThere were 36 injuries (0.49 per million) in each of 2012 and\n2013, and 62 injuries (0.84 per million) in 2014 (as of June).\n1 Introduction\nLightning is responsible for an estimated 24 000 fatalities\nand 240 000 injuries every year globally (Holle and Lopez,\n2003). In the USA (1959–2006) 101.2 people per year on\naverage die due to lightning, a number that has decreased\nover time to about 45 per year by 2006 (Ashley and Gilson,\n2009). In Canada, 9–10 lightning-related deaths and 92–164\ninjuries occur every year (Mills et al., 2008). In the UK there\nwere 2 fatalities per year on average for the period of 1988–\n2012 (Elsom and Webb, 2014). Average fatality per year was\n230 in Mexico for the period of 1979–2011 (Raga et al.,\n2014). Table 1 shows an average number of fatalities during\na year per 1000 000 population for some countries. Africa\nhas the deadliest statistics. Although there are numerous difficulties\nthat affect the compilation of such report-based data\nsets (e.g. data collection, population density distributions,\nsocio-economic factors, telecommunication facilities), having\nthese databases and related statistics is a necessity for\neach country for risk assessment.\nAs in other parts of the world, Turkey experiences a large\nnumber of deaths and injuries due to convective storms, particularly\nwith lightning. Over a 23-year period (November\n1975 to October 1998) at the Ankara Numune Teaching and\nResearch Hospital, 22 patients were treated for lightning\nburns (Aslar et al., 2001). Also, case studies in Turkey have\nbeen published in medical journals on the effects of lightning\nstrikes on the human body (e.g. Alyan et al., 2006; Celiköz et\nal., 1996; Aslan et al., 2004). Despite these studies, nationwide\nstatistics on lightning deaths and injuries have not been\ncompiled.\nThe purpose of this paper is to compile a database on\nlightning-strike incidences that have killed or injured people\nin Turkey. The data are gathered from various sources\nfrom January 1930 to June 2014. Although finding all incidents\nthroughout history and creating a complete database is\nnot possible, existing records can be used to determine how\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n', '1882 Ş.

Furthermore, some specific information\n(e.g. percentage of victims under trees) can help to\ncreate public awareness. Section 2 of this paper describes the\ndata and the methods used. In particular, the sources of the\nrecords, how these sources were searched, and the characteristics\nof the records are described. Some observations on\nthunderstorms and lightning in Turkey are given in Sect. 3.\nIn Sect. 4, statistics of the lightning incidents are presented.\nSection 5 summarizes the findings of this study.\n2 Data and methods\nAny lightning-strike event resulting in human injuries or fatalities\nis defined as an incident in this paper. Five sources\nwere used to create a database of incidents: archives of the\nTurkish State Meteorological Service, electronic archives of\ntwo mainstream national newspapers (Cumhuriyet and Milliyet),\nEuropean Severe Weather Database, and the internet\n(Fig. 1). These five data sources are presently described.\nThe first source was the Turkish State Meteorological\nService climatological station data set, which routinely reports\nexceptional weather events, known as FEVK obser-\nvations. FEVK is an abbreviation for the word fevkalade,\nwhich means exceptional, extraordinary in Turkish. These\nobservations – which include the information on weatherrelated\nexceptional phenomena, human fatalities and injuries,\nand property damage – have been stored in the headquarters\nas hard copies since 1939. Scanned pdf and jpeg formatted\nrecords were obtained and manually searched, yielding 220\nlightning incidents. Approximately one third of all incidents\n(29.6 %) were from this official source.\nThe second source was Cumhuriyet, a national newspaper\nwith the biggest online archive in Turkey (Cumhuriyet\narchive, 2013). News from 1930 to the present week is accessible\nto registered users of the archive who purchase\na membership. This archive was searched for the Turkish\nword yıldırım (cloud-to-ground lightning), yielding 333 inFigure\n1. Relative contributions of lightning incident data sources\nto the total data set. TSMS is the Turkish State Meteorological Service,\nand ESWD is the European Severe Weather Database.\ncidences. The biggest portion (44.9 %) of the incidents was\nfrom this archive, as it covered the longest time range.\nThe third source was the online archive of Milliyet, another\nnational newspaper, which was also searched for lightning\nevents using the same method (Milliyet archive, 2013). This\narchive includes news from 1950 to 2004 and is freely available\nto registered users. Seventy-five incidences (10.1 %)\nwere from Milliyet. At the time of writing of this article, there\nare no other digital archives for old newspapers in Turkey.\nA fourth source was the European Severe Weather\nDatabase (ESWD; http://www.essl.org/cgi-bin/eswd/eswd.\ncgi). The ESWD contributed 33 incidences (4.4 %), although\ndamaging lightning phenomena was introduced as a separate\ncategory in ESWD only in 2011.\nA fifth source was the Google.com.tr searches with\nthe keyword yıldırım from 1 January 2012 to 30 June\n2014. Eighty-one incidents (10.9 %) were found by internet\nsearches. After including the internet searches and ESWD\nrecords, 42 incidents in each of 2012 and 2014 (as of June),\nand 34 incidents in 2013 were counted, which produced far\nmore incidents than all other years in the previous decades.\nComparing all of these five sources led to only 17 duplicate\nreports. In case of a duplicate report, all available in-\nformation from both sources was used. Then, the incident\nwas assigned to the source containing the most informative\nreport. After gathering all records and sifting out the duplicates,\na database was built consisting of 742 incidences from\n1930 to 2014 in Turkey. These known lightning incidents resulted\nin 895 fatalities, 149 serious injuries, and 536 other\ninjuries. Injuries mentioned as serious in the reports were\nclassified as serious injury in the database.\nOne weakness of the newspaper-based records was that\nthe exact date of some incidents may not be known as the\noccurrence may be listed as “last week” or “the previous\nday”. When there is no precise information about the exact\ndate of the event, but the month is known, the month\nis used in relevant figures and classifications, but unreliable\nsituations are not included in these statistics.

Data were provided by the Turkish State Meteorological Service.\nlages that changed their name were another important problem\nwith old records. Further investigations were done to find\nthe correct geographical locations of the old records that took\nplace in a renamed town or village (e.g. Issızviran Village is\nnow called Issızören Village, Şeytanbudaklar Village is now\ncalled Uluçam Village, Rizok Village is now called Oymak\nVillage).\n3 Thunderstorms and lightning in Turkey\nStation observations of the Turkish State Meteorological Service\nindicate that thunderstorms occur in Turkey throughout\nthe year. Monthly-average numbers of thunderstorm days at\n277 Turkish State Meteorological Service stations between\n1960–2013 were bilinearly interpolated with an inverse distance\nweighting method (variable radius, 2nd power) on a\ngrid of 263× 100 points to produce a gridded analysis of\nthunderstorm frequency (Fig. 2). Thunderstorms were most\nfrequent in May and June all around Turkey, especially over\nthe inland and northeastern parts. The maximum thunderstorm\nfrequency shifts to the Aegean and Mediterranean\ncoasts from late autumn to early spring, while the rest of\nTurkey has relatively infrequent thunderstorms.\nGeographical distribution map (Fig. 3) shows that average\nstroke density is lowest in southern parts of the central\nTurkey and is highest along the coasts with maxima around\nMugla, Hatay, and Adana (see Fig. 8 for locations). GLD360\n(Global Lightning Data set 360) lightning observation data\nprovided by Vaisala over a 2-year period (1 October 2011 to\n30 September 2013) are used to display annual (Fig. 4a) and\ndiurnal (Fig. 4b) distributions of lightning over Turkey (For\ntechnical information about the data see Said et al., 2010,\n2013). The annual distribution of lightning was consistent\nwith the annual distribution of thunderstorm observations as\nexpected (cf. Figs. 2 and 4a). Both lightning and thunderstorms\nwere most frequent in May and June. Figure 4b shows\nthat most of the lightning strikes occurred in the afternoon.\n4 Results\nBecause the data set is not homogeneous throughout the\nperiod, it is not possible to talk about the incident trends\nwww.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1881/2015/ Nat.

However, an increasing number of lightning\ncausalities and injuries in the 1950s and 1960s, and\na decrease in late 1980s and 1990s, are notable (Fig. 5).\nAccording to the Turkish Statistical Institute, the population\nof Turkey increased rapidly from 1939 to 2012, from\n20 million to over 75 million (see ahead to Fig. 12) (http:\n//www.turkstat.gov.tr/Start.do). Due to the unrepresentativeness\nof the historical data and missing records, determining\nthe average mortality rate for a long period was not possible.\nWith the inclusion of incidents from the ESWD and the internet,\nthe number of incidents are quite high for the last 3 years.\nThe total number of fatalities was 31 persons in 2012 (0.42\nper million), 26 persons (0.35 per million) in 2013, and 25\npersons (0.34 per million) in 2014 (January–June). The total\nnumber of injuries was 36 persons (0.49 per million) in each\nof 2012 and 2013, and 62 persons (0.84 per million) in 2014\n(January–June).\nMonthly and diurnal distributions of the incidents and\nsome other aspects of the incidents (e.g. the places of occurrence,\nthe genders of victims) are analysed. Most of the inci-\ndents (89 %) occurred from April through September with a\npeak in May and June (26 and 28 %), followed by July (14 %)\n(Fig. 6). Sixty-seven percent of all incidents occurred in these\n3 months. Incidents peaked in late spring, similar to the peaks\nin thunderstorm and lightning observations (Figs. 2 and 4a).\nThis peak was also consistent with the Turkish severe storm\nclimate, as the large hail and continental tornado frequencies\nincrease in Turkey around May (Kahraman and Markowski,\n2014; Kahraman et al., 2014). Another reason for this peak is\nthe increasing number of human activities that move outside\nin the spring, particularly during agriculture and shepherding.\nThere were local or UTC time information in 136 of the\nreports. Local times were converted into UTC; local time\nis UTC+2 in Turkey from October to March and UTC+3\nfrom April to September due to daylight savings. More than\nhalf of all incidents (54 %) occur between 09:00–15:00 UTC\n(Fig. 7), which is as expected considering the increasing\nFigure 4. (a) Annual and (b) diurnal distribution of lightning over\nTurkey between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2013. Local\ntime in Turkey is UTC+2 from October to March and UTC+3 from\nApril to September due to daylight saving time. Data were provided\nby Vaisala.\nnumber of lightning at this time of the day (Fig. 4a). Some\nother severe storm-related phenomena (i.e. severe hail and\ntornadoes) are also most frequent in the afternoon in Turkey\n(Kahraman and Markowski, 2014; Kahraman et al., 2014).\nIncidents are rare during the night.\nThere are more incidents near highly populated areas,\nnamely western Turkey and especially Istanbul (Fig. 8).\nThere is also a lower density of incidents over central Turkey.\nThe lowest density of lightning over central Turkey and relatively\nlow density over eastern Turkey were similar to the\ngeographical distribution of lightning-related incidents (cf.\nFigs. 3 and 8). The number of incidents in Istanbul is higher\ncompared to the other regions with the same stroke density,\nbecause of the massive population of the city (number of the\nincidents occurred in Istanbul is 40 which is 5.4 % of all incidents,\nwhereas stroke density over the city is about 0.5–\n2 km−2 year−1).\nThe geographical distribution of lightning incidents for\neach month (Fig. 9) suggests that the relatively rare occurrences\nin winter months almost always happened along the\nsouthern and western coasts, which follows the thunderstorm\nclimate (Fig. 2). The number of incidents increased in southeastern\nTurkey in April. By May and June, incidents occurred\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1881–1888, 2015 www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1881/2015/\n', 'Ş. Tilev-Tanriover et al.: Lightning fatalities and injuries in Turkey 1885\nFigure 5. Number of lightning incidents, fatalities and injuries (serious and other) per year (January 1930 to June 2014).\nFigure 6. Annual distribution of the total number of lightning incidents\nby month (January 1930 to June 2014).\nin all parts of Turkey. By July, the number of incidents in the\neast began to decline, and, after August and September, the\nnumber of incidents sharply decreased across most of Turkey.\nOf the 1580 people in our database who were killed or\ninjured, the gender of 849 (53.7 %) was known. For 578 fatalities,\n386 (67 %) were male and 192 (33 %) were female\n(Fig. 10). These values are more balanced than for other\ncountries. For example, comparing the gender of lightning\nfatalities in the US from two data sets 100 years apart shows\nthat the percentage of events resulting in only male fatalities\nwas over 70 % in the 1890s, but rose to 80 % in the 1990s\n(Holle et al., 2005). In Canada, 84 % of all lightning fatalities\n(1921–2003, excluding 1950–1964) were male (Mills et al.,\n2008). The percentage of male fatalities is also large in Mexico:\n79 % (Raga et al., 2014). In contrast, the Turkish data\nwere more comparable to that in the United Kingdom (1993–\n1999) where 72.7 % of deaths were male (Elsom, 2001).\nThe percentage of men and women with serious or other\ninjuries is not that different from that of the fatalities\nFigure 7. Diurnal distribution of the total number of lightning incidents\nby 3 h period (January 1930 to June 2014). Local time in\nTurkey is UTC+2 from October to March and UTC+3 from April\nto September due to daylight saving time.\n(Fig. 10). Combining all three categories in Fig. 10, 553 of\n849 people struck by lightning were men (65 %) in Turkey,\njust like the 65 % in the UK (Elsom, 2001). The reason\nwhy men are twice as likely to be struck than women is\nthat men are more likely to be doing outdoor jobs. However,\nthe female fraction is higher compared to the statis-\ntics from the other countries, which is presumably because\nmore women work in agriculture in Turkey than the others.\nThe percentage of female employment in agriculture\nis 37 % in Turkey (2012), whereas it is 1 % in US (2010),\n1 % in Canada (2008), 4 % in Mexico (2011) and 1 % in\nUK (2012) (Data retrieved from The World Bank website:\nhttp://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.FE.\nZS/countries/1W-CA-GB-US-MX-TR?display=map).\nAge information was available for a small number of\nevents. Out of a total number of 369 incidents where ages\nwere known, ages of 258 (29 %) deaths, 47 (32 %) seriously\ninjured and 64 (12 %) injured victims were known. Most of\nthe victims were young people; 59 % of deaths were younger\nwww.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1881/2015/ Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1881–1888, 2015\n', '1886 Ş.

Similarly, 66 % of seriously injured victims and\n63 % of injured victims were younger than 30 (Fig. 11).\nIf an incident occurred in a province or district centre,\nthen it was categorized as urban. If an incident occurred in\na town or village, then it was categorized as rural. Most of\nthe incidents (86 %) occurred in rural areas and only 14 %\nin urban areas, with 367 records having this information. In\nthe 1950s, only 25 % of the population were living in urban\nareas, whereas, by the 2000s, 70 % of the population were\nliving in urban areas (Fig. 12). In each year, the number of\nincidents was always higher in rural areas during the period\n(Fig. 13). The percentage of urban incidents was relatively\nhigher for the 1920s–1950s and the 1990s. Relative minima\nare also present in the total number of incidents for the 1940s\nand 1990s, suggesting that the higher urban incident rates can\nbe the result of socioeconomic issues that probably affected\nthe reporting from rural areas. For example, poverty due to\nWorld War II can be the reason for underreporting from rural\nareas for the 1940s.\nReports show that 71 of the incidents occurred on farms.\nVictims of 112 incidents were shepherds, which contributed\nto the rural occurrences. Hiding under a tree, a common behaviour\nduring heavy rain and hail, resulted in 94 fatalities,\nFigure 12.

Tilev-Tanriover et al.: Lightning fatalities and injuries in Turkey\n5 Summary\nThe Turkish State Meteorological Service archive, archives\nof Cumhuriyet and Milliyet newspapers, internet and the European\nSevere Weather Database were searched to collect\ndata on lightning-related fatalities and injuries in Turkey. The\nresulting data set covers January 1930 to June 2014. There\nwere 745 incidents, resulting in 898 deaths, 150 serious injuries\nand 536 injuries. The total number of fatalities was 31\nin 2012, 26 people in 2013 and 25 people in 2014. With a\nTurkish population of around 73.7 million, the number of fatalities\nwas 0.42 per million in 2012, 0.35 per million in 2013\nand 0.34 per million in 2014 (January–June). The total number\nof human injuries was 36 in each of 2012 and 2013, and\n62 in 2014. Considering the population, the rate of injuries\nwas 0.49 per million in each of 2012 and 2013, and 0.84 per\nmillion in 2014 (January–June).\nIncidents were most frequent in late spring all around\nTurkey and were rare during winter. The majority of lightning\nincidents occurred during the afternoon, with fewer oc-\ncurring at night. The number of incidents was higher over\nthe highly populated western parts, especially in Istanbul and\nrelatively lower in central and eastern Turkey. Geographical,\nannual and diurnal distributions of the incidents were\ncomparable to thunderstorm and lightning observations, as\nwell as with the report-based severe weather climatologies\nfor Turkey.\nThe risk of being struck by lightning was highest for the\npeople participating in outdoor activities such as farming and\nshepherding. The number of male victims was nearly twice\nthe number of female victims. Almost all of the incidents\noccurred in rural areas. The number of victims under trees is\na sign of the need for awareness campaigns.\nAcknowledgements.
