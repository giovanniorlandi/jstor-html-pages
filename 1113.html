His eyes wore on Cavendish,, who Instantly arose to his feet, startled, by the man\'s sudden appcaracce., "There is no use making a scene., Burke," the big man said sternly, "for, my partner there has you covered.", "My name Is not Burki\'; it Is Cav, endish.", "So I heard in Denver," dryly. "We, hardly expected to find you here, for, we were down on another matter. So, you are not Gentleman Tom Burke?", "No.", "I know he is not." Interposed West, cott. "I have been acquainted with, this mnn for nearly twenty years; he, is a Now York capitalist.", "And who the h—1 are you—a pal?", the fellow sneered. "Now. see here,, both of you. I\'ve met plenty of your, kind before, and It Is my business not, to forget a face. This man is under, arrest." and he laid a hand heavily on, Cavendish\'s shoulder. ,, "Under the name of Burke? On, what charge?", "Robbery, at Poughkeepsie. N. T.;, wanted also for burglary and assault, In Denver. My name is Roberts." he, added stiffly, "assistant superintendent, of the Pinkertoa agency: the man with, me N an operative from the New York, office.", Cavendish glanced past Roberts, toward Colgate, who stood with one, hand thrust in his side pocket., "You know this man Burke?" he, asked., "I saw hltn once; that\'s why I was, put on the case. You certainly gave, I me some hot chase. Tom.", | "Some chase? What do you moan?", [ "Well. I\'ve been on your trail ever, , since that Poughfeeepsie Job—let\'s see,, J that whs two months ago. You jumped, I first to New York city, and I didn\'t, really get track of you until the night, 1 "This Man Is Under Arrest!", :, | of April 1<>.

You say, j you had a photograph of me?", i! "A police picture; here it is if you, .\' want to look at it—taken in Joliet.", j U\'iMcoft grasped the sheet, and, \' spread it open. It was Cavendish\'s, . face clearly enough, even to th«> close, ly trimmed heard and tile peculiar, I twinkle in the eyes. Below was print, \'i ed a brief description, and this also, fitted Cavendish almost esartly., "Weli," said Roberts, none too pleas, ■ i autly, "what have you got to s^y now?", [ "Only this." and the miner squared, ! his shoulders, looking the other, i straight in the eyes. "Tills mnn a not, | Tom Burke, but I can tell you where, j Tom Burke is.", 1 "Yes. you can!", I "Yes. I can. I cannot only tell you., but I can prove it." he went on earnest, | ly. "This description says that Burke, I had a small piece clipped out of one, , ear, and that he had n gold-crowned, tooth In front, rather prominent. This, man\'s ears are unmarked, and his teeth, are of the ordinary kind.", \' | The two detectives exchanged, j glances and Roberts grinned sarcas, j tically., \' I "You\'ll have to do better than that,", * he said gruffly., ^ "Ail right. Is there r.ny mention, !n tlmt description of n peculiar and, vlviil scnr on the chest of this nuiu, Burke? It would he spoken abont, l£, he had. any. wouldn\'t it?", "Sure; they never overlook them, things.", "Good; unbutton the front of your, shirt. Fred.", The t«o stured nt the scar thus re, vealed, still iucredulous. yet unable, to refute the evidence of Its existence., Huberts touched It with his Ongers to, better assure himself of Its reullty., "Parti it all," he confessed. "This, bents h—I.", "It docs," coincided XVescott. "This, whole affair has been of that kind., Now I\'ll tell you where Tom liurke Is, —lie lies burled in the Cavendish fam, ily lot In Brooklyn." ., ITe turned to Col pate, who stood with, mouth half open., "You\'re from New Tork; ever henr, of the Cavendish murder?", "Only saw a paragraph in the Chi, cago papers. It wasn\'t my case, and, the only thing that Interested me was, that the name happened to be the, same as assumed by the man I was fol, lowing—why?", "Because this gentleman here Is, Frederick Cavendish, who was report, ed as killed—struck down !n his apart, ments on the night of April 1C. Instead, he took the midnight flyer West and, you followed him. The dead man was, Tom Burke: wait a minute and I\'ll tell, you the story—all I know of It, at, least.", He told It rapidly, yet omitting no, detail of any Interest. The two de, tectives. already half convinced of, their mistake, listened fasclnuted to, the strange narrative; It was a tale of, crime peculiarly attractive to their, minds; they culd picture each scene, in all Its colors of reality. As the, speaker ended, Itoberts drew In his, breath sharply., "lint wim siticcea MnrKej ne bskcu., "The fellow went la tliore after swag;, but who got him?", "That is one question I can\'t an, swer." replied Westcott gravely, "anil, neither can Fred. It doesn\'t seem to, accord with the rest of our theories., Knrlght told Lacy he didn\'t know who, the deud man was. or who killed him.", Miss I>onovan pushed ner way In, front of Cavendish, and faced the oth, ers Iter cheeks (lushed with excite, ment, a paper clasped In one hand., "Perhaps I can help clear that up,", she said clearly. "This Is the letter, found under Miss La Hue\'s bed. 1 have, read part of it. It was written by Jack, Cavt ndish just as he was taking a boat, for South America. It is not a confes, sion." she explained, her eyes search, ing their faces, "just a frightened boy\'s, letter. I wouldn\'t understand it at all, if I didn\'t know so much about the, case. What It seems to make clear is, this; The La Hue girl and Patrick En, right schemed to get possession of the, C\'avend: it property through her mar, riage to John; this part of the pro, gram worked out fairly well, but John, could not get hold of enough money to, satisfy them., "Ktiright and the girl decided to put, Frederick out of the way. but lacked, the nerve to commit murder—at least, in New York. Their scheme seems, to have been to iuveigle their victim, away from the city, and then help him, to got hilled through an accident. In, that case the law would award the tn, tire estate to John. They never told, John this plan, but their constant de, mands for money fairly drove the, young man to desperation., "The making of the will, and the, suddi n proposed departure of Fred, erick for the west, compelled Immedi, ate action, yet even then John was, kept largely In the dark as to what, they proposed doing. All he knew was, that Frederick had made a will dis, inheriting him; that he left the Col, lege club with this document in his, I and Intended later to take a, night train.", She paused, turning the letter over, in her hands, and the men seemed to, draw closer In the Intensity of their In, terest. *, "Some of what I say I learned from, this letter," she went on quietly, "and, some I merely deduce from the cir, cumstances. I believe the boy went, home half mad. his only thought be, Ing to destroy that will. In this state, of mind, and fortified by drink, he, stole later into Frederick\'s apartments., I don\'t believe the boy actually Intend, ed to murder his cousin, but he did In, tend to stun him with a blow from be, hind. s-ize the paper, and escape un, «een. It was a wild, hare-hrulned, project. but he was only a boy, half, drunk, worked into .frenzy by Celeste, La Rue. He got ir.tb the room—prob, ably through the hath room window—, unobserved, but after Frederick had, departed. Tills other man—Pttrke—, was then at the table, running through, I lie oauers he had taken {nun the, snrp, to see If nriy were or value. Jonn,, convinced the man was big cousin,, stole up behind him and struck him, down. He hnd no Idea of the force of, the blow delivered, and may even have, left the apartment without realizing, that the blow had been a fatal one., Afterward there was nothing to do,, but keep still, and let matters take, their own course,", "And what happened then?", "Naturally this: the La Rue wom, an wormed the truth out of him, and, told Enrlght. From that moment the, boy was "entirely In their hands. While, they remained In New York they, helped blm keep his nerve, but as soon, as ho was left alone, he went entirely, to pieces. He wa9 no criminal, merely, a victim of circumstances. At last, something happened to frighten him, Into flight.", The four men straightened up as her, voice ceased speaking. Then Roberts, laughed. as though, ashamed of the, breathless Interest he had exhibited., "I guess she\'s got that doped out, about right, Colgate," he said, almost, regretfully. "And It\'s clear enough that, we are ou the wrong trail. Anyhow, this man here Isn\'t Tom Burke, al, though he would deceive the very dev, il. \'What Is It, landlord? Am I ready, to eat? Just lead the way, and I\'ll, show you." He glanced about at the, others. "Any of you missed your sup, per? If so, we\'d be glad to have your, company.", "I\'ll accept the Invitation," returned, Cavendish. "I wns asleep upstairs,, and fniled to hear the bell. Perhaps, you gentlemen can tell me wbat.step\'s, I\'d better take In n case lite mine.", The tlireo passed out together, fol, lowing the guidance of Tlmmons, and, as the sound of their voices subsided, Into h confused murmur, W\'estcott, glanced into the face beside him., "You must be very tired, dear.", "I am tired, Jim," sho said, "but, I mustn\'t allow It. I have a big Job, on hand. Furris will want three thou, sand words of this and he\'ll want It, tonight, so that he can scoop the town.", "Scoop the town?" Westcott re, peated., "XtfS, II1UI I11C«U3 U.lJ yupwt Cjv- —, story that no otlicr paper gets. And, I this Cuvendish case is going to be my, scoop. Will you walk with mo down, to tho station?", Big Jim Westcott nodded silently, and took her arm In his and together, they went out Into the night., | Each stone, shrub, each dark frown, I lng cliff reminded them of their meet, ing, and silently, with their hearts, j full, they walked along until a dilapi, dated box car hove In view, with one, j oil-lamp still burning, twinkling evl, | deuce that Carson had not retired for, ! the night; and us they came abreast, 1 the door they found him dozing., "Wake up, Carson," cried Jim, tap, i ping him on the shoulder, "wake up, I and get ready to do a big Job on the, j keys. And keep your ears open, too,, I old tinier, for It\'s interesting, every, word of it—Miss Donovan is going to, tell a story.", Carson rubbed his eyes, sat up, gave, I ample greeting, got up, Ut another, lump, and tested his wire., "East wire free as air, Jim," he said,, j "You can begin that there story when, 1 ever you want.", j And so, weary as she was, and with, I nerves still high-pitched, Stella Dono, I van began, slowly nt first, until she, • got the swing of her "lead," and then, more rapidly; one after another the, | yellow sheets on which she wrote wero, | fed past Westcott\'s critical eyes and, \'.into the hands of Carson, who oper, j ated his "bug" like a madman., An hour went past, an hour and a, quarter—Stella Donovan was still writ, j lng. An hour and a half.
