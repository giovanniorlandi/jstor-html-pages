After visiting all the pro\nmising towns and much adver\ntised sections, he settled in Ed\nmonton as being the proper\nplace for a man who was seek\ning the land of milk and honey,\nwith untold treasures as a side\nissue.\n"He says that Edmonton is on\nthe boom, that city property is\nmultiplying in value every week\nand that money is very free. The\nwhole of northwest Canada is\nbooming in proportion. The gov\nernment, aided by the railroads\nand land speculators have worked\nup enthusiasm to the fever pitch.\nThey are rushing in American,\nEnglish and eastern Canadian\nsettlers by the train load, and\nthat a stampede is taking place\nto secure land.\nEvery conceivable commodity\nhas advanced in\'proportion to the\nland values and as soon as the\nready cash of the settlers is gone\nthere is bound to be a crash.\nThe country is simply over\nboomed.\nMr. Brennan reports that the\nthermometer registered as low\nas 65 degrees in Edmonton\nwinter and that 45 degrees\nlow was a popular register,\nsnow was three and four\ndeep and as a result thousands\nof head of stock starved.\n"He also says that that coun\ntry will never gain a reputation\nas a health resort. Rheumatism,\nwhich kept both Mr. Brennan\nand his wife in the throes of\nmisery during their residence\nthere, is as common as the stom\nach ache, while typhoid fever\nprevents the towns from becom\ning over populated.\n"Mr. Brennan says that one of\nthe popular industries that is\nflourishing throughout that sec\ntion is the fleecing of the scions\nof English nobility. These \'re-\nmittance men\' from bloody\nEngland are great plungers and\nwill take a flyer in anything from\na peanut stand to a cave of gold\nbricks, and that that section is\ninfested with wise ones who\nmake a specialty of catering to\ntheir demands. Mr. Brennan\nsees many good points in west\nern Canada, but as a whole it\'s\nback to good, old Minnesota for\nhim.

The sore itself is simply an outside evidence of\nsome internal poison, and the only way to cure it is to remove the deep\nunderlying cause. Sores and Ulcers originate usually from a retention in\nthe system of bodily waste matters and impurities. These should pass off\nthrough the natural avenues of waste, but because of a sluggish condition of\nthe different members they are retained in the system to be taken up by thfj\nblood. This vital fluid soon becomes unhealthy or diseased, and the\nslcin gives way in some weak place and a Sore or Ulcer is formed. The con-\nstant drainage of impurities through a sore causes it to fester, grow red and\ninflamed and eat deeper into the surrounding flesh, and often there is severe\npain and some discharge. S. S. S. is the remedy for Sores and Ulcers,\nIt is nature\'s blood purifier, made entirely\nof vegetable matter, known to be specific*\nfor all blood diseases and disorders^ S. S. S.\ngoes down to the very bottom of the\ntrouble, and removes the poison and im\npure matter, so that the sore is no longer\nfed with impurities, but is nourished and\ncleansed with a stream of healthy, rich\nblood. Then the place begins to heal, new flesh is formed, the inflamma-\ntion subsides, and when S. S. S. has thoroughly cleansed the circulation the\nplace heals permanently.

The bill as\nintroduced carried aggregate appro\npriations of $11,500,000.\nThe bill, Introduced at the morning\nsession, was made a special order for\n3 o\'clock and the house worked on the\nbill from then until midnight with a\nrecess for supper. "When the bill had\nbeen gone over item for item, with a\nfight made on almost every section,\nthe total amount added to the bill was\nonly $74,800, while $37,900 had been\nstricken out, leaving a net increase\nof $36,900.\nThe principal items inserted were\n$40,000 for a bridge over Minnehaha\nglen at the soldiers\' home and $10,000\nfor a silver service or other mmeorial\nfor the battleship Minnesota. The\n$25,000 provided for a light and power\nplant for the state fair grounds was\nthe only large item stricken out.\nAlthough some members, notably R.\nH. Jefferson of Bingham Lake and El\nmer A. Adams of Fergus Falls, made\nit a point to fight everything in the\nbill, the principal fight was on the ap\npropriation for the state fair. Every\nitem in that section was attacked, but\nthe power plant was the only one\nstricken out. A. J. Bockne of Zum\nbrota led in the fight on these ap\npropriations.\nBill for State Tax Levy.\nIn connection with the appropriation\nbill, the bill for the state tax levy was\nintroduced at the morning session and\nplaced on the calendar. It provides\nfor an annual tax levy of $1,500,000, or\na rate of 1.5 mills. It is believed,\nhowever, that this will have to be\namended so as to make it 1.7 mills in\norder to raise sufficient revenue for\nthe state. The tax levy last year was\nonly 1.2 mills.\n"I consider this a sort of graft, but\nI haven\'t the moral courage to vote\nagainst it," said G. B. Higgins of Min\nneapolis when the resolution appro\npriating $150 each for Rose Bartell\nand Rose O\'Regan, employes at the\nlegislative telephone room came up in\nthe house. Some of the members\nsaid it was not a graft, some said it\nwas a custom, some said the girls had\nearned the money.

This was\nrestricted to questions mostly and no\nserious objection was made to the bill,\nwhich received forty-four votes, with\nnone against it. The bill divides $200,-\n000 a year among the eighty-five coun\nties of the state for each of the next\ntwo years. The money will be ex\npended by the county commissioners\nof each county.\nThe senate allowed the claims of\nSenator J. M. Hackney and of Pierce\nButler of St. Paul for $1,000 for their\nexpenses in the contest for Senator\nHackney\'s seat.\nThe senate laid on the table the\nhouse resolution demanding the nomi\nnation and re-election of president\nRoosevelt for another term. The reso\nlution was called up by Senator M. L.\nFosseen of Minneapolis and its adop\ntion was proposed. Senator J. F. Cal\nhoun, also of Minneapolis, moved as\na substitute motion that the resolu\ntion be laid on the table, which pre\nvailed on a rising vote.\nWhen a farmer or one of his\n"boys" over twenty-one years of age\ngoes out in the morning to shoot a\nfew ducks he will have to have a\nlicense or be in danger of arrest by\nthe game warden.
