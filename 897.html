Chilton, In Failing Health,\nWill Return to this County\nTo Live.\nEddyville, Ky., Nov. 21 John B.\nChilton, warden of the penitentiary\nhere, and his small group of guards\n.and deputies who are calmly waiting\nfor Edwin P. Morrow\'s ax to fall.\nThey know that when\' it does their\nofficial heads will drop into the pro\nverbial basket, but they are prepar\ned. Mr. Chilton, perhaps will re\nturn to Christian county, from\nwhence he came, and many of those\nholding places under him will go\nback to the farm.\nFor more than seven years now\n)Mr. Chilton has been head of the\nEddyville prison, the lash that form\nerly made prisoners writhe in agony\nhas been locked, in the drawers of\nthe desk in his office. Other instru\nments of torture havo been banished\nalso, the retiring warden never hav\ning bel\'eved in the Dark Age meth\nods of dealing with pi-isoners.\nThere are 457 inmates of Eddy\nville penitentiary at present, 300\nless than were doing time behind the\ngray, grim walls of the institution\nthree ears ago. Three reasons for\nthe falling off in enrollment are as\nsigned by Mr. Chilton.\n"First," he said, "the war came\nalong, and as a result the army ab\nsorbed a big per cent, of the crimin\nal element.\nSecond, people, in general are\nmore prosperous than formerly,\nthere being work for all willing to\nwork, and in consequence there is\nnot the incentive for stealing.\n"Third, the temperance wave that\nhas swept the country doubtless has\nhad a lot to do with decreasing the\nnumber of inmates." . 1\nFour In Death Cell. . j\nFour of those now in Eddyville\nprison, are facing death in the elec\ntric chair, having been sentenced\nand their sentences confirmed. Dates\nfor their executions have not been\nfixed as yet, however. Those under\ndeath sentence are Charles Douthitt,\nScott county; Delbert Thomas, Har\nlan county; Charles Music, Boyd\ncounty, and Joseph Hughes, Oldham\ncounty. The latter is a negro. "\nSince this prison has been in ex\nistence there have been thirty-two\nexecuted within its wajls. Twenty-\nfour of these have taken place dur\ning Mr. Chilton\'s term of office. Un\ntil the last ten or twelve years capi\ntal punishment in this State was ad\nministered by hanging in the county\nin which the crime was committed.\nOnly two of the 457 inmates of\nEddyville prison are wearing stripes,\nthe badge of convict degradation, all\nthe rest are\' first or second class pris\noners, the first denoted by the gray\nuniform and blue cap and second by\ncap and uniform of the same color,\nof meting out physical\npunishment to the state\'s bad men in\nhis charge, Mr. Chilton has adopted\nwhat he considers a more effective\nmethod of disciplining them, that of\ncurtailing privileges.\nRecreation Fpr Prisoners.\nAfter considerable dickering with\ncontractors employing prison labor,\nMr. Chilton, early in his administra\ntion, leached an agreement with\nthem whereby a convict, after com\npleting his task, would have the re\nmainder of the day for recreation,\nsuch as baseball in summer and pool\nplaying in winter, instead of being\ncompelled to put in twelve full hours\nat his work.\nThe convicts soon came to" look\nforward with keen pleasure to the\nlate afternoons, when, with \' tasks\ncompleted, they were free to leave\nthe shops and go into the compara\ntive open.

In an ef\nfort to meet the situation resulting\nfrom the present acute shortage of\nsugar, President Wilson revived the\nwar-time power of the federal gov\nernment over the nation\'s food sup\nply. In a proclamation, the president\ntransferred to Attorney General Pal\nmer the broad authority exercised by\nFood Admisistrator Hoover during\nthe war;\nWhile it is Mr. Palmer\'s present in\ntention to exercise this authority on\nly as far as sugar is concerned, he is\nprepared to use it to meet any simi\nlar situation affecting other food\nsupplies which might arise.\nRevival of the wartime functions\nresulted directly from government\nefforts to avert a famine in sugar,\nbut the powers delegated tt. the head\nof the department 01 justice will be\nused also to help put down the ever\nmounting cost of living.\nMr. Palmer\'s staff will begin im\nmediately to build up a sugar dis\ntributing system which will allocate\nall sugar stocks in the country. It\nwill provide an equitable system of\ndistributing supplies and will defeat\nany consecration of hoarding, offi\ncials said.\n. Plans tentatively decided \'upon,\nprovide for increasing the price of\nall sugar, excepting the Louisiana\ncrop, for which a price of 17 cents\nalready has been rlxed, to It -ents a\npound, wholesale.\nThrough this, , new sources of sup\nply are expected to be opened. With\ntssurances of a fair margin of prof\nit, said to be about $1.54 a hundred\npounds, allowed, sugar refiners are\nready to enter the Cuban markets\nand purchase all available stocks,-it\nwas stated. Thus, officials believe,\nthe increased price will avert a short\nage which threatens to become a\nfamine during the next sixty days.\nRetail Price About 14 Cents.\nWhile the margin between the\nwholesale and retail price of sugar\nhas not yet been determined, officials\nare known to have tentatively con\nsidered 1.54 cents, making the retail\nprice approximately 14 cents a lb.\nThis, however is subject to change,\ndepending upon a variety of condi\ntions. : Sharp curtailments of sugar con\nsumption by c.itu\'y and soft dr\'nk.\nmanufacturers also will be ordered\nas" officials declare the present short\nge is due in a measure to the in\ncreased consumption of candy and\nsoft drinks which has followed the\nenforcement of prohibition. Detials\nas to this curtailment remain to be\nworked out.\nCuban Supply 4,000,000 Tons.\nClothed with their new authority,\ndepartment officials will sign an\nagreement with beet and cane sugar\nrefiners, whereby the latter are to go\nin the Cuban market and purchase\nall available stocks. The supply of\nCuban sugar, in its raw state, is es\ntimated at 4,000,000 tons.\nGas In Scotland.\nMore thnn 23 per cent of Scotland\'s\nilluminating gas is made In municipal\nplants to more than 51 per cent lu Ire\nland and about 30 per cent in England.\nLA\nFor Relief of\nRHEUMATISM\nor\nMuscular Soreness\nFor Sale only at\nCampLell-Coates Co.\nINCORPORATED\nNinth and Main Streets\n3C\nChristmas\n1\nAdd to the pleasure of your Christ\nmas shopping by coming here to\nview our displays.\nArticles unique yet useful and of a\nquality that will withstand the wear\nof years.\nA few Chiistmas suggestions:\nWATCHES the timely gift RINGS, DIAM\nONDS, SE AL, or BIRTHSTONE\nJewelry of a\' I kinds.\nJames H.

The American Le\ngion post was organized here last\nnight, and members by acclamation\nelected Jules Leblanc, former army\ncaptain and the only special officer\nwho was wounded, as commander.\nThe police were looking for the ne\ngro and defying the police, labor\nleadersBou\'chillon and O\'Rourke, pro\nlecting him, marched in a street pa\nrade.

Magee said he\nordered Williams to drop the - gun\nand notified him of the warrant for\nDakus\' arrest. The reply, according\nto Magee, was a shot from Williams\nwhich struck Leblanc in the arm.\nThe desperate and determined bat\ntle then began, with Williams drop\nping dead in his tracks from a quick\nvolley from the special officers. The\npolicemen said that Bouchillon was\nkilled at the window when his pump\ngun jammed as he was attempting\nto shoot Gaines, they said, fired\nthrough the garage door first with a\nDistol and later with a shotgun. His\nbody was found in the middle of the\ngarage. Dakus and an unknown num\nber of white men made a dash for\nthe woods and escaped. O\'Rourke\nand James Williams climbed out a\nwindow, police officials said, and\nmade a break for safety, but O\'\nRourke fell with buckshot wound3 in\nhis breast and Williams threw up\nhis hands.

W. W.\'s., Bolshevists and\njomb throwers, and while radicals of\nbat type are not numerous in this sec\nion of the country as yet, it is the\nlope of the Baptist 75 Million Cam\npaign to make the spread of such de\ntractive propaganda here imppsslble\niy so pervading with the gospel all\ntenters where radicalism might expect\no obtain a foothold as to make it im\nlossible for the professional agitators\no receive a sympathetic hearing. In\nither words, it is the hope of the cam\nlalgn to so extend the work of Amer\ncanizing and Christianizing the for\n:igners living witiin the territory of\nhe Southern Baptist Convention that\nhey will measure up to , the . highest\'\ntandards of patriotism and religion. .\nThere are 4,000,000 persons of for\nign birth and children of foreigners\nIving within the territory of the Soutu\nrn Baptist Convention, and while cons\niderable work has been done already\n.long the line of teaching Americanism\n,nd the Christian religion to these\neopl this work will be greatly en-ari,-ed\nas a result of this campaign.\nIn the Southwer.tern states there"\nre 1,CJO,000 Mexicans, COO.000 living\nl Texas, 200,000 in New Mexico, 75,000\nl Louisiana and a large \' number In\nrkanhdH, Oklahoma and Missouri. Be\n.ivse of-.thi) growing importance of\nthe Mexican work the campaign has\nappropriated J57R,O00 to it alone for\n:he next five years.\nBut the Americanization and evan\ngelization of the foreigners is not con\nlined to Mexicans. This work is car\nried on also among the newly-arrived\nmmlgrants at the various Southern\n?orts, .among those af foreign birth in\n.she mining districts of Alabama, Okla\njiomaT\'and Illinois and among other\nfcroups\'of people of foreign birth in\nFlorida, Louisiana, Texas, Maryland\nmd Virginia. Some of the -state or\nganizations carry en work of their own\nsmong these people, while in many\nplaces, the program Is carried out co\nsperatlvely between the state mission\nboards and the Home Mission -Board.\nIn many Instances a large work is\nJone by the latter agency alone.\nBelieving that both Americanization\nind evangelization can be accomplished\nmost effectively by first reaching the\nshildren, Baptist agencies have estab\nlished schools where the English lan\nguage is taught, along with American\nand Christian ideals. Such schools\nire already being conducted with great\nluccess among the Italian and Cuban\nchildren at Tampa, Fla., for French\nipeaking children at Church Point,\nLa., for Mexican children at El Paso\nnd other Texas points, while commun\nity center work is carried on exten\nsively at many of these points and at\'\nnumerous towns and mining centers\nwhere people of foreign birth make up\ni large percentage of the population,\nthe social work of this character being\nconducted by Baptist women.\nLarge results are expected to follow\n(he work of the Baptist Bible Institute\nst New Orleans, where Instruction Is\ngiven in English, French, Italian and\nSpanish. All forelgn-speakfag people\nare required \' to take some English\nwork and the Bible is taught In certain\npractical subjects to them in their own\nlanguages, thus facilitating their grasp\nof it. Practical Christian activities are\nalso required of all the students, some\nof whom are training for foreign mis\nsion work and others for service among\nthe peoples of forolgn birth in this\ncountry. Patrlptism and hif h ideal of\nChristian civilization are given erapha\nsis throughout the institution and it is\nthe belief of those familiar with Its\nwork that it will prove a potent factor\nfn the Americanization and Chrtol\'an\nfzition of the peoples of foreign birth\nfn this country.\nUse of Drinking Water.\nDrink whatever water you desire\nwith meals, but do not take Ice water,\nand, do not use water merely to wash\nfood down your throat Water aids di\ngestion by helplng-to liquefy the food\nand by bringing the gastric juices Into\ncloser contact with the food particles.\nWater does not affect the enzymes and\nweaken them by dilution as some peo\nple maintain, because the power of the\nenzymes depends not on the percent\nage which I present, hut iiuon their\ntotal amount and chenn nl composi\ntion. 61am at the Gntlt ex.\n"If da: was any h \'niifT teautlful\nmermaldn,\' said Unek ifibt\'n, "a lot o\nhuman ladies would git jenlous an\nCrown delrse\'fs tryin\' to Imitate \'em.\nmm mm\nxi.t.w,.s\nIke Kiad You Have Always Bought, and which has bcea\nla use for over thirty years; has borne the signature of\nAll Counterfeits, Imitations and \' Just-as-good " are but\nExperiments that trifle with and endanger the health of\nInfants and Children Experience against Experiment.\nlAhat is CASTORIA\n" Castoria is a harmless substitute for Castor Oil, pares,-"" -\nDrops and Soothing Syrups.

In 1858 proclamations of n\nday for Thanksgiving were issued by\nIhe governors of twenty-five states\nand two territories, and it only re\nmained for ihe president of the Uniteil\nMate to make such proclamation t\nInstitute the national Thdnksg\'v: :\nI\'ilV,\nGreece, In the months of August and\nSeptember of each year, after the har\nvest had been gathered, celebrated the\ngreat feast known as the Eleusinia, or\nthe feast, to Demeter of the beautiful\nrobe. Demeter, the great earth-moih-er,\nwas the goddess of cornfields and\nharvests. Iler -daughter, Persephone,\nwhile gathering flowers one day, was\nkidnaped by Pluto. Demeter searched\nfor her long by land and sea, and at\nlast learned that her lost daughter had\nbeen married to Pluto, the dark- spec\nter of the underworld, and that she\nwas now "his queen In the realm be\nlow. But Persephone had eaten a\npomegranate seed and could remain\nwith her mother only part of the year.\ni This made Demeter angry, and she left\njthe gods and made her dwelling upon\n: the earth. She taught Celeus, king of\n: Kleusis, agriculture, how to- plow, sow\n: and reap. - This feast was one of the I says\n.grandest of. the Grovk festivals.\nj. The Romans celebrated a. harvest\nfestival called the .CVrealla. It took\n: its name from \'Ceres, who v.is the\n; Demeter of the Romans, and the feast\n: was celebrated at soiu time iu the\nmonth\' of October. Sacrifices of th\nbest fruits and honey cakes were of-\nJfered up In the temple. \'Procession\n\' were madeto the Holds by . men and\n\'.women dressed in white and crowned\n, with oak leaves and popples.- Cores\nUvns represented iu a chariot drawn\nI by. dragons, her head crowned with a\ngarland of corn ears, and holding a\njrasket of popples In her hand. .

S. Demand For\nRelease.\nWashington, Nov. 21. State De\npartment officials still awaited to\nnight a reply to the note warning the\nMexican government that any fur\nther molestation of William 0. Jen\n\' kins, American Consular Agent at\nFeubla, who was arrested twice in\nconnection with his recent abduction\n. by bandits, would seriously affect\nthe relations between the United\nStates and Mexico.\nWhile the text of the American\ngovernment\'s communication has\nnot been made public, the summary\npublished by the State Department\nindicated that it was one of the\nsharpest even sent to the Carranza\nGovernment. It said the Untied\nStates was both "surprised and in\ncensed" to learn of the reimprison\nment of Jenkins and demanded his\nimmediate release.\nSo far as was made known, no re\nport regarding Jenkins reached the\ndepartment today from the embassy\nat Mexico City, but officials believed\nthat if he had not been released he\nsoon would be as a result of the State\nDepartment\'s demand.\nt Many Soldiers Needed.\nDiscussing the general Mexican\nsituation today, State Department\nofficers revealed that before the\nworld war the army staff estimated\nthat complete intervention in Mex\nico would require 450,000 men, op\nerating over a period of three years.\nPresent estimates were not available,\nbut it is known that army officials\nhold that the force necessary at this\ntime would be much less because of\nthe increased army equipment, such\nas motorized transport, artillery and\nairplanes. .\nDuring the day the department\nmade public a complete report from\nJenkins on his capture and his sub\nsequent treatment in a hospital at\nPeubla after his friends had agreed\nto pay $150,000 in gold for his ran\nsom, pledging their lives that the\ninstallments would be forthcoming.\n. It was under date of Nov.\'7 and am\nplified the account which Jenkins\nwrote to Representative Davis of\nTennessee and which Mr. Davis made\npublic yesterday.\nN,o Attempt To Catch Bandits\nJenkins said that "a very impor\ntant\' matter" was that, "although\nthe local government could hardly\nbe restrained from sending troops\nout immediately to punish my cap\ntors when they learned of my cap\nture, they have not made the slight\nest effort to do so since I returned\ntwelve days ago,, although they have\nbeen incited to do so, but excuse\nthemselves by saying that they will\ndo so." \'\n"The rebels are only a few miles\ndistant," he wrote, "they have been\nthere for months and years, they\nplant, cultivate and gather their\n. crops entirely unmolested, the whole\ncountryside is with them, and yet\nthe government apparently makes no\neffort to drive them away, and give\ndecent protection to this city. There\nare in the immediate vicinity of this\ncity not less than half a dozen im\nportant bands of rebels, all of them\nwell known to the Government and\nno determined effort has ever been\nmade to fight them. This is the sit\nuation as it is today in this city.\nPeubla is the second largest city\nin Mexico.\nAnother Outrage.\nJenkins also said it was "worthy\nof attention to take note of the at\ntitude of the state Government of\n. Peubla assumed toward this incident,\nfor almost immediately after my\ncapture the official paper of the Gov\nernment published the opinion that\nI had been instrumental in my own\nkidnaping and that I had formed a\nplot with the rebels and other friends\nof mine to cause international dif\nficulties; also that it was the in\ntention to collect this ransom from\nthe Mexican Government and divide\nit, etc. etc.\nExpenses Incurred.\nThe consular agent itemized the\nexpense he incurred in connection\n. with his abduction, placing the total\nsum at $357,341.91 Mexican gold, in\naddition to the $300,000 Mexican\ngold paid or to be paid to bandits\nthe loss included $50,626.05 Mexican\ngold stolen from the safe in the\nagent\'s office; $5,550 expenses and\nlawyers fees for Lie Mestre, a friend\nof the agent, who helped to arrange\nfor his release and who has been ar\n- rested by the Peubla Btate authori\nties in connection with the, abduc\ntion, and small sums for hospital\nw for himself and wife.\nJ;-.Lipf ha9 announced his inten\ntion to appeal t the Government for\naid in defra;- -g these expenses,\nState Department officials said today\nthat because of the Mexican\'s Gov\nernment\'s laxity in trying to clean\nthe rebel bands, it had failed to give\nproper protection to the consuar\nagents who might have grounds for\na claim against the Mexican Govern\nment for ransom money.\nMexico\'s Reply Expected.\nWashington, Nov. 24. The an\nswer of the Mexican Government to\nthe sharp note demanding the im\nmediate1 release of William O. Jen\nkins, American Consular Agent at\nPeubla, probably will be delivered to\n\' the State Department today. "\nA long dispatch bearing on the\nJenkins case it was learned, has\nbeen received by the Mexican em\nbassy and was being decoded today\nfor presentation to the Government.\nWhile authorative information as\nto the attitude of the Mexican gov\nernment was lacking, indications\nhere pointed to a technical refusal\nto order the release of Jenkins and\na new set of charges against him of\nconspiracy against the Mexican "gov\neminent."\nJ\n" . m n mm\nA, (\nVV\nA.
