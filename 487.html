The chairmen of the program\ncommittee announce that they have\nbeen very fortunate in arranging for\ntwo lectures by Prof. M. Ten-Eyck,\nprofessor of Agronomy in the Kansas\nAgricultural college. I\'rof. Ten-Eyck\nis a national figure among agricul\ntural scientists.

This alone Willi\nincrease the ordinary appropriations\nby $50.000,000, less such sum as\nmay be saved by the omission of a\npublic buildings bill.

When the\nsixty-first congress comes into life,\nii will face the problem of raising\nprobably $200,000,000 a year more\nthan the present revenue laws sup\npi» and the indications are that the\nbulk of this sum will have to come\nfrom domestic sources.\nIn ι his connection, it may be not\ned that there is a continual decline\nin the amount derived from liquor\ntaxes.

The sports of Angel- \\\ntown were completely confounded, j\nnot to say dodgasted. when Ketchel i\nput it over Big Bill, and they believe j\nthat Papke was off his feed and will ,\nbe able to come to the front again ;\nwhen in condition. If Papke succeeds ;\nin showing up Kelly, which is entite- !\nly probable, it will appear that there :\nis something valid and reasonable \'\nin the horoscope of the piebald pro\nphets of Angeltown. Anyhow there\nare a lot of fans who will refuse |\nto sing "Hail to the Chief" fo Ketch- \\\nel until he has given the Illinois j\nlad a chance to make good his boasts, j\nMeanwhile. Mr. Ketchel holds the\ntitle, which puts kibosh on the\ntheory entertained by many sports\nthat a defeated champion never\nconies back.\nWhen l\'apke meets Ketchel again,\nhe will have the prayers of a whole\ntown. Kewanee, Illinois, is the place\nKewanee—let that sink in. That\'s\nwhere Papke lias his home and hab\nitat. and every man of that seaport\ncity is a devoted admirer of the\nsuave and smiling fighter. When the\nnews came of Papke\'s defeat. the\nwhole town went into .mourning.\nFlags were hoisted at half mast.\nand strong men wept and women\ngroaned at the terrible thing that\nhad befallen their townsman. The\nfamous burg where Casey struck\nout, in that memorable time at bat, I\nhad nothing on Kewanee in the mat\nter of s:loom and its by-products. 1\nNow all is changed. Hope has taken\nt.he place of discouragement, and\ndirect from Kewanee comes a mes\nsage of gladness in which it is stat\ned that "every one of Billy\'s friends\nstill is enthusiastic over his ability ι\nand thinks that it is only a question j\nof time before he will prove he is\nKetchel\'s master again."\nWhich goes to show that while a\nprophet may be without honor in his\nown bailiwick, that rule doesn\'t ap\nply to pugs. None whatever.\nSan Francisco reports state that\nJack Gleason is still gloating over\nthe fact that Jim Croffoth lest 2,\n500 hard men in pulling off the\nKetchel-Papke bout. Gleason, It will\nbe remembered, first arranged the\nbout for Thanksgiving eve, but Crof\nfoth went him one better in the mat\nter. of financial inducement and the\nfighters decided to go to Colma.\nCroffoth\'s receipts were $18,231.\nHe gave the fighters a $20,000 purse\nof which Papke got $1 2,000 and\nKetchel $8,000. As Crofoth had to\nadd $1.679 to make up the purse and\nat least $800 more for advertising\npurposes and lawyer\'s fee, he cer\ntainly got stung a plenty.\nAAAAAAAAAAA.\nTry the Tungsten Lamps\nfur si- le li.htirg aid the Tantalum Lamps foi your\n* residence.
