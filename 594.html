They needed men, hundreds, of thousands of them, and we are, sending them.- They had to have food,, hundreds of thousands of tons, and we, have been sending it. But their need, is greater today than it has been at, any time since the war cloud first, broke. They still need men, but they, must have food. We can send millions, o\'i men, inexhaustible supplies of ain, jiii;!iii\'.on?but they will be of no avail, if we fail to support the troops over, there and the people behind them. If, the food fails them, they will fail., We know n?w that never have the, Allied nations faced a grimmer strug, gle for existence than confronts them, today. We know that only to Ameri, ca may they turn for assistance. So, great has been the toll of the U-boat, that every ship must be made to work, at full capacity. Every vessel must, take the greatest possible number of, trips, traveling to the nearest source, of supply?America. If the source of, supply fails them, it means that their, ships must go farther from the scene, of conflict. It\' means a dimunition of, foo>i. And that means an approach to, starvation?failure, defeat., The strength of those people over, there depends solely upon us. Starv, ing people cannot jphold their ai mies., And I he armies, even if the\\ aie fed,, cannot be kept in the field if the me.i, know that privation and want aie ad, ded to the suffering back home. The, knowledge that their women and chil, dren were starving would rob them, gf \'the spirit which has maintained, their determination to stand unyield, ing before the onslaughts of I\'rissia., We must face the fact that there is, not in this country enough food to, meet the actual necessities of Europe, if we maintain <>ur normal consump, tion. We must ?ee.) thew, out we, have Mt in_America only the amount t, which would normally be consumed be, fore another harvest. We can export, only what wc save. If our savings arc, small. Europe will be under!ed the, war will be lost., The greatest need in Europe today, is. for wheat. They must have mil, lion? of bushels. Seventy-five million ;i, bushels, on the first, day of this year,, was needed to tide them over till July, 1st. Lord Rhondda, Brfttish Food, Controller, cabled the United States?, Fool Administration that unless, America could supply it, he could not, take responsibility for assuring the, English that they would be fed., As long as the first of last Decem, ber, we had exported our entire wheat, ?surplus. Since then we have been, able to ship only what our people have, saved?and we are falling behind on, the program., So grave has become the situation,, that today it is no exaggeration to, declare that he who wastes a.slice of, wheat bread is actually hindering the, prosecution of war and,endangering,, our chances Tor victory. Our wheat, consumption mu-t he cut t" 1 1, pounds per week-a reduction of 50|, per cent. This is a military necessity, and should be viewed in no other light., There are ways most of us can help., Thore is one way every one of us can, hc]p?bv standing gaurd over our na, tion\'s larder. All "f us cannot save,, but all of us can do something to co, ordinate the nation\'s savings and to, nolice the distribution of our food, .supplies. Across the sea they nee:i, badlv the four principal staples, are being asked t? savP, meats, wheats, fats and. sugar. But most of, all they need /wheat. Waste it and, we are wasting lives., On the curb we place upon our ap, petites depends the success of our men, and the Allies in Europe., Negotiations With Norway, Christiana, April 10.?That a detail, ed proposal for an agreement between, Norway and America has just reach, ed here from Washington, and thac, a sneedy conclusion of negotiations, to the satisfaction of both nations is, looked for, is the declaration of lead, i?g newspapers here.

It, ? . .ivas constructed in 1810, before there, were railroads in that section, and it, v \'.vtfaSrfi part of the thoroughfare ficni, \' Tennessee to Alexandria, and oftm, 1 120 to GO wagons could be seen in ~, . ; line making the trip to and from the, boats at this city., ?f . The first toll was collected at Gate, . \' No. 1 by Simeon Hillmnn, and he con, tinued to collect toll until his death In, * I StIO. From 1800 to 1SK2 the gate was, kept by his widow, Charlotte Hillman,, when, on\'account of war conditions., ] the irate was abandoned until 1S(5">., The house was struck by a shell just, * brfoiv the Battle of Kernstown., It was at this gate that Charlotte, Hillmnn held up General Sheridan an !, his staff. ? The general paid the regu, lar toll for himself and his staff fol, lowed his example., "But." s.-\'.id the general as he passed, through, "I cannot vouch for my, army.", * ? When the soldiers came Tup Mr?., > Hillman raised the pole, but stood at, [ her post all day long and kept tally, and after the war she sent the toll to, ] Washington and it was promptly paid., General Sheridan passed through, this gate again on his famous ride, from Winchester.

She has spread that be, lief with great industry before now, and has found it to pay very well., Nothing would suit her purpose bet, ter now than to have America rest, comfortably in the conviction that, there will bj? nothing more to do after, the present drive is stopped. Ger, many herself" will rest in no such be, lief. If the present offensive fails, Hindenburg and Ludendorff will be, busy shaping public opinion at home, for the next one.. THe war will be, ended, not by the allies stopping a, German drive, but by the Germans\', failure to stop an allied drive?by the, allies beating the Germans and push, ing them out of France and Belgium, and back within their own boundaries, and keeping them there. The less we, talk about getting peace by stopping, the Germans sixty miles from Paris, the better prepared we will be for the", job that will still remain ahead after, they are stopped. There will be no, peace while a German soldier remains, on French or Belgian soil., HORSEY AGAIN AT LARGE., One of the Schultz Murderers Takes, French Leave From the State Farm., Eugene Dorscy, one of three Alex, andria negroes who are to pass the, remainder of their lives in the peni, tentiary for participation in the mur, der of Walter Schultz, March G, 1009,, is again at large. Dorsey, it will be, remembered, escaped from the stale, farm some time ago, and later came, to this city where he delivered him, self up to the authorities. He was, returned to the penitentiary., Walter Schultz was an artist of, Chicago. He camc to Washington to, witness the inauguration of President, Taft, and two days later visited Alex, andria. Early on the morning of Sun, day. March 7,1900, his body was founo\', in the snow a short distance from, Rosemont station, on the electric rail, way, his throat having been cut. His, gold watch was on his person and sev, * ral letters of credit. Henry Smith, was arrested the same day on suspi, eion of committing the murder, al, though the charge alleged was that, he had stolen a watch. During the, next day he told a remarkable story to, the cffict that Richard Pines, Calvin, Johnson and Eugene Dorsey were the, real murderers, and that he met the, trio carrying the body west on Cam*, eron street early the previous Satur, day night. Pines, he alleged, forced, him at the point of a pistol to aid !r., carrying the body. Pines, "Johnson ant}, Dorsey were unable to establish alibis,, and the four were tried and sentenced, to electrocution. Smith suffered the, extreme penalty of the law, but the, Governor commuted the sentences of, the other participants. The trio sent, to the penitentiary asserted their in, nocence from the first., WHAT IT WILL COST., Alexandria has been ""apportioned, an amount expected of the\'city by the, purchase of the third series of Libertv, Don;)s., I he timid practical soul who a-ks, the question, what will it cost? should, try to answer another.

General at Washington and, a German army of occupation, with all, the insane brutality that war has, taught the Germans, quartered upon, us, ami garrisons in every city." And, that is only the beginning of the, cost., i! would cost us an indemnity under, which the American people would, groan for decades., It would c-ost us our position as the, leader of civilization in America., It would cost us the domination of, Prussian influence in all our internal, affairs, and Prussian authority over, all cur international relations., It would cost us the last trace of, freedom of speech ami of thought; the, last vestige of civil government., :i wauid cost us the opportunity to, work out our "national program, and, develop onr national life., No wonder intelligent loyal Ameri, cans Jo not shrink t;*om paying the, price of victory!, WOl\'LD LEAVE NO TRACE., Rescued fr~\'m the oil tanker Atlan, tic Sun, which was sunk by a German, submarine, at the time his brother, was drowned. George E. Daniels, of, C amden. X.

"We had two quarts, of-brandy," said Daniels, "and we, managed to keep the men we rescued, al.ve until we reached-shore bv giving, them a little at a time." He\'declared, fhat he was not aware that "his broth, er was dead until six days after the, sinking., Readers of The Gazette who peruse, accounts of such cruelty upon the part, of people who are supposed to be civ, ilized will remember the action of the, Spanish navy at Santiago when Cap, tain Hobson and companions sank the, steamer Merrimac in the narrow, channel at Santiago for the purpose, of blockading the Spanish fleet. Af, ter the sinking of the Merrimac and, the crew had taken to the water the, Spaniards came out and.rescued Hob, son and his men. Admiral Cervera, it, will be remembered, was one of those, who aided in the rescue of the Ameri, cans.

As she, came closer, he said, he picked up a, stone, and, not knowng why, he threw, it at her., Then he saw her fall, and knew the, 1(?,tone must have struck her. lie said, he could not recall what happened be, tween this lime and when he ran to, the railroad station to report seeing, her lying beside the rails., He asserted that he never touched, Miss Ebert," not even after she hud, fallen, and was at a ioss to explain, how his shoes became spotted with, blood and how the long, heavy wrench,, which the police believe lie used, also, happened to have blood marks upon it., The detectives assert that Isaacs\' in, ability or refusal to explain what oc, curred between the time of hittina, Miss Ebert with the stone and hn, arrival at Odenton can easily be ac, counted for by the appearance of p., struggle on the sand where Miss, Ebert\'s body was found, the discovery, of the wrench and the blood-stained, shoes said to have belonged to the, negro., CONC,RESSMAN RALLIES., Veteran Virginia Representative Re, ported "Little Better.", Washington, April 10.?Represen, tative William A.
