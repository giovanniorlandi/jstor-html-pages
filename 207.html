However, this is not a geographical exercise. We cannot \ncount on South Africa as a place where Ubuntu is practiced or on South Korea living in \ncommunities according to Sangsaeng. The reason is that Western civilisation, with its own \nspirituality, has permeated all corners of the earth. My thesis is that this is the spirituality \nof money; biblically speaking, of Mammon. Before we can talk about a spirituality for \ndemocracy and social cohesion, we need to address the spirituality of the status quo in order \nto understand what the alternative could be. The issue gets complicated by the new insight \nthat Western civilisation has deep roots in history; in fact a history of almost 3000 years. \nOnly by looking at this history can we really understand how money did not only change \nsocio-economic and political structures but also hearts, minds and the spirituality of people.\nIntradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article challenges the normal \nWestern assumption that democracy is but a political issue of voting every 4 or 5 years. \nInstead it shows that real democracy is linked to economic and social justice, as well as \nto deep cultural and spiritual roots. Authors should carefully identify the contextual \nperspective they challenge, identifying the potential results of the proposed research and \nwhether it calls for a change in traditional discourse as well as whether such a change is \npossible. Key insights into the research results and its future function should be revealed.\nToday we are faced with life-killing civilization, manifested in economic injustice, ecological destruction, \nthe threat of Empire, and the escalation of religious conflicts. This compels us to urgently explore the \npossibility of life-giving civilization which affirms relationships, co-existence, harmony with creation, \nand solidarity with those who struggle for justice. This quest finds meaning in Ubuntu and Sangsaeng. \n(Transforming Theology 2007)\nIntroduction\nToday we are experiencing psychological and spiritual suffering and disease amongst a growing \nnumber of people. In India, about 54 farmers on average commit suicide daily out of despair \nbecause they have been driven into debt beyond their means (Martin & Kakde 2006). Workers \nsuffer increasing stress and anxiety whilst middle-class people fall into depression, which in 2020 \nwill presumably be the second largest illness according the World Health Organization (WHO). \nIn contrast, nearly all people are making their decisions according to the one yardstick: ‘What is in \nit for me?’ They are thus motivated by an egocentric spirituality. What are the roots of all of this?\nThe spirituality of money in the Axial Age and in the \ncapitalist civilisation of modernity\nMy thesis is that what we are now experiencing started nearly 3000 years ago within what is called \nthe Axial Age, beginning in the 8th century BCE in the whole of Eurasia, from Greece to China. At \nthat time, a new economy started to appear in daily life, built on money and private property. It \nhad tremendous social as well as psychological and spiritual effects. To analyse what happened \nthen helps to understand what is happening today. Looking at the responses to this development \nfrom the different faiths and philosophies in Israel or Judah, India, China and Greece may also \nhelp us to better understand the tasks and possibilities of a spirituality of democracy and social \ncohesion in our age.\nIt was the philosopher Karl Jaspers who coined the term Axial Age (Jaspers 2010). According \nto him, the experience of violent crises between 800 and 200 BCE might have prompted the \nparallel efforts of the prophets, the Buddha, Confucius, Daoism and Greek philosophy to find \nnew foundations for living together. He characterised the new approach as intellectual and \nPage 1 of 7\nScan this QR \ncode with your \nsmart phone or \nmobile device \nto read online.\nRead online:\n', 'Original Research\ndoi:10.4102/ve.v35i3.1332http://www.ve.org.za\nspiritual (geistig), looking only marginally at the economic \nand political context. Recently Karen Armstrong and, based \non her findings, Jeremy Rifkin took up this theory, looking \nparticularly at war and violence as causes for the responses \nwithin the different cultures (Armstrong 2006; Rifkin 2009). \nJosé María Vigil (2012) also recently published a chapter in \nhis book Theology of axiality and axial theology. As far as the \nsocio-historic context of the Axial Age is concerned, my \nthesis comes closest to what Graeber (2011) worked out in \nhis book Debt: The first 5,000 years, although he is not that \ninterested in the religious responses. Combining his insights \nwith my own research (cf. Duchrow & Hinkelammert 2004), \nlet me summarise how the new economy affects the ancient \nsocieties and spiritualities.\nMoney as unit of account was used in the palaces and \ntemples of Mesopotamia as early as around 3000 BCE, but \nthe ordinary economy of people in daily life functioned via \na system of mutual credit. This changed when soldiers and \nmercenaries became professionals and war-making was \nraised to previously unknown levels. They had to be paid. \nThe most important wage was the spoils. As precious metal \ncould easily be transported, it started circulating in little \npieces as a kind of money. Around 600 BCE, authorities in \nLydia, India and China started nearly simultaneously to coin \nthe metal in order to pay mercenaries and soldiers. With \nthese practical currencies, local markets also developed for \ndaily transactions by the normal people. This means that \ncash and unified markets are the children of war.\nAt the same time slaves, usually prisoners of war, but \nby now increasingly also debt slaves, were turned into a \nnegotiable commodity. This is why Graeber calls this new \nsystem the military-coinage-slavery-complex. A kind of \nvicious circle emerged. New professional armies looted \nprecious metals from temple or palace treasuries, jewellery \nof women and slaves from the populace. The slaves had to \nwork in the mines to produce more metal for the coinage. \nThe coins were paid to the soldiers and stimulated the local \nmarkets and so on. The whole system only functioned as \nlong as it expanded through further conquest. So it is no \nsurprise that this system was easily wedded to imperialism. \nIncreasingly, the empires also requested the payment of \ntribute in the form of money. This development found its \nfirst climax in the Hellenistic-Roman empires.\nOn this basis, the logic and spirituality of calculated exchange \nin markets emerged. Goods for daily needs were exchanged \nwith money as the unit of account. Money became the ‘one’ \nin the variety of commodities, but not as a ‘thing’, detached \nfrom the social process in which people recognise its value, \nas the Buddhist economist, Karl-Heinz Brodbeck, points \nout (Brodbeck [2009] 2012). This means that the daily use \nof money also changed the soul and the thinking of people. \nBesides communicating by speech, namely using words \n(logos), they communicated by calculating in money (ratio). \nIn so doing, the individual ego gained precedence over \nrelations in community.\nThe developments above were furthered by the fact that, \nin the process of exchange in the market, the money owner \nhad more power than the producer of goods. Money as \nsuch offered access to the market whilst the product first \nhad to be in demand. Coping with this risk is only possible \nby having as much money as possible. One of the ‘sages \nof antiquity’, Pittakos of Mytilene, underlined this by \nsaying: ‘Profit is insatiable’ (Binswanger 1995:34). He does \nnot say: ‘The one who makes profit is insatiably greedy’. \nWhat he says is that an economy in which money is made \na commodity is inherently greedy. This is why, in our new \nbook, Franz Hinkelammert and I speak of ‘greedy money’ \n(Duchrow & Hinkelammert 2012). There is an ‘objective’ \nbase for greed to accumulate money without limits.\nThe other implication of the new money economy is that \nmoney gives the right to private property beyond personal \nuse. Money gives access to the market, cushions the risks, \nmeasures the exchange value and gives access to property \nrights. Combined with the development of hierarchies and \nclasses in larger societies, money and private property \nstarted to determine the economic, social and political power \nof people within societies.\nIn any case, the new economy led to greed and the desire to \naccumulate limitless money. The institutionalisation of this \ngreed was inscribed in interest. Debtors had to pay back more \nthan they had borrowed, for example to purchase seed. They \nalso had to put up their own land as security. If they could \nnot pay back their debt plus interest, they lost their land and \ntheir family had to work as debt slaves for the creditor. Thus \nprivate property and money came into existence at the same \ntime and led to debt slavery and loss of land. At the same \ntime, creditors could collect more and more land, money and \ndebt slaves. This is what scholars have called the emergence \nof a class society in antiquity (Kippenberg 1977).\nPrivate property and money also reinforced the male \ndomination of patriarchy since only men could own \nproperty, which was a way of giving them political power, \ntoo. The house father (in Greek: despotes, in Latin: dominus) \nwas seen as the owner of the land, women, children, slaves \nand cattle. This meant that democracy in Ancient Greece \nwas also a democracy of male property owners. In Roman \nlaw, private property even received the status of an absolute. \nMen were legally allowed to use, misuse or destroy it. Both \nthe Hellenistic and Roman empires built on a calculating, \nconquering spirituality, from the household to the emperor.\nSo the result of introducing money as commodity and \nprivate property as an absolute, combined with imperial \nconquest, was an increased division in societies between \nmasters and slaves, men and women, a more and more \nprecarious situation of small farmers and, in general, a \ndire impoverishment and suffering for the majority of \npeople. This was not just a structural problem, because \nmoney also changed people’s souls. Besides communicating \nthrough speech and cooperation, they started calculating, \nPage 2 of 7\n', 'Original Research\ndoi:10.4102/ve.v35i3.1332http://www.ve.org.za\nPage 3 of 7\nwhich included calculating each other’s performance in \ncompetition. So the problem was not just structural, but it \ntook on a psychological and spiritual dimension.\nBefore looking at the religions and philosophies resisting \nthese developments in the Axial Age, let us briefly analyse \nhow the modern capitalist civilisation built on the early \nmoney and private-property economy, giving it a new \ndynamic. In early capitalism, from the 13th to the 14th \ncentury CE, the market set out to conquer one sphere of life \nafter the other. The basic step was the privatisation of land \nas commons through enclosures, subjecting agriculture \nto the mercantile coordination of labour. Another new \nelement was the introduction of compound interest. \nHowever, the most decisive new element was the invention \nof double-entry book keeping in the upper Italian trade and \nbanking cities. Here everything was calculated according \nto debit and credit, costs and return, input and output – \nwith one goal only: to gain maximum profit. Double-entry \nbookkeeping was not just a social technique but the decisive \ncharacteristic of a new worldview. People started looking at \nthe world as a functional mechanism to produce profit for \noneself. The calculation of utility followed the means-end \nrationality, which is the typical way of thinking in European \nmodernity that meanwhile dominates the whole world. As \nthe economy serves the one purpose of maximising profits, \nnormal people judge everything according to a single \nyardstick: ‘What’s in it for me?’\nIt was Thomas Hobbes and John Locke in the 17th century CE \nwho worked out the Western concepts of the human being \nand democracy (Duchrow & Hinkelammert 2004). Hobbes \ndefined the human being as a competitive atomised \nindividual striving for limitless accumulation of wealth, \npower and reputation, this in the context of the political \nbody, called Leviathan, whose blood is defined as money. \nLocke defined the human being as property owner and \ndemocracy as the political order which has the only purpose \nof protecting property.\nSo, structural, cultural and personal greed came to be seen \nas something positive. Finally, Jeremy Bentham and Adam \nSmith defined greed and egoism as a virtue and the decisive \nmotor of the economy. The mechanism of continuously \nre-investing the profit in new projects in order to gain higher \nprofits created an obsessive accumulation machine. Money \nthat is constantly re-invested for accumulation purposes is \ncalled capital. Capital is not simply money but money or \nassets in monetary terms invested for getting more money. It \ncan also be frozen to capital in the form of machines serving \naccumulation. So, greedy money is the exact description of \nthe nature of capital, of profit thirsty for more profit. This is \nwhy capitalism is the precise term for the economic system \nand the form of society of Western modernity. Market \neconomy is a euphemism in order to avoid touching the \ntaboo. If you want to use this term in a capitalist context, \nyou need to say ‘capitalist market economy’, because in the \npast there were, and in the future there will be, other kinds \nof market economies. There can, for example, be exchange \nmarkets without money, but there can also be markets with \nmoney although these may not have money in the form of a \ncommodity geared at accumulation.\nIndustrial capitalism deepened the division of labour and \nincreased the split between the classes. However, its key \nnew feature is the increased throughput of energy and \nresources for profit’s sake, aggravated by the fact that \nconsumerism has to be stimulated for the sake of maximum \ncapital accumulation. The result of this shift is only visible \nnow as we face the energy and ecological crises. Karl Marx \n(Marx & Engels 2012) was prophetic when he stated:\nCapitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the \ncombining together of various processes into a social whole, only \nby sapping the original sources of all wealth – the soil and the \nlaborer. (s.p.)\nHe also analysed the obsession with accumulation by the \ncommodity-money mechanisms as fetishism, driving people \nand societies even against reason. This means that capitalism \nis more than an economic system. It is a religion – an insight \nfurther developed by Walter Benjamin in his essay on \ncapitalism as religion. This is exactly what we experience \ntoday as growth fetishism is destroying the earth. It can only \nprevail because people have internalised the spirituality of a \ncalculating money subject.\nToday this fetishism has taken the form of financial capitalism \nafter it turned out that infinite growth is not possible in a \nfinite world. Within the financial sector, the growth obsession \nhas turned to speculation, with ballooning financial assets in \nall kinds of forms. However, it is not without a link to the real \neconomy because when the balloons burst, as we experienced \nin the years following 2007, the neoliberal governments take \nreal money from the working tax payers and throw it into \nthe voracious jaws of the money owners and their agents, \nthe banks. This shows that our formal democracy is unable \nto serve the interest of the people. It is a democracy of the \nbanks, by the banks, for the banks. As this policy increases \nthe debt of the public budgets, big capital is blackmailing \nthe governments to pay even higher interest rates and curb \nsocial benefits. It seems certain that the whole system will \none day collapse, thereby increasing the suffering of people \neven more. Financial capitalism is the ultimate climax of a \ndevelopment starting in the Axial Age.\nIts spiritual dimension may be demonstrated by a poem \nabout gold composed by the Swiss poet Mascha Madörin \nfrom advertisements of banks – especially because gold is \none of the most fateful natural gifts to South Africa and its \nhistory:\nGold is validation; its promise carries weight.\nGold is surprise; it exceeds the greatest expectations.\nGold is security; on its stability the world depends.\nGold has charisma; it never loses its shine.\nGold is faithfulness; it never betrays its owner.\nGold is eternity; its fascination outlives time.\n', 'Original Research\ndoi:10.4102/ve.v35i3.1332http://www.ve.org.za\nPage 4 of 7\nGold is secret; no one can completely fathom its allure.\nGold is gratitude; it knows how to express itself in immortal \nwords.\nGold is love; there can hardly be a more noble manifestation.\nGold is trust; its value endures.\nGold is affection; it can express feelings better than a thousand \nwords.\nGold is longing; its attraction never fades. (Madörin 1989)1\nFor me, the conclusion is that we are not dealing with this \nor that crisis but that this whole civilisation is death-bound, \nnot just the economy. It is only because the majority of \nthe people and, to some extent, all of us are imprisoned in \nthe same kind of logic, spirit and practice that the system \nis still able to operate. Are there possibilities of structural \nand personal transformation to find a new culture of life \nwhich could be nurtured? Before addressing our own \noptions, let us look at some responses by the Axial Age \nreligions. Of course, we have to realise from the beginning \nthat all religious communities today have to a large extent \nassimilated to the dominating civilisation. So we have to \nrealise with the classic South African Kairos Document that \nwe are in the midst of a struggle between state or capital \ntheology, church theology and prophetic (or liberation) \ntheology when we look at the traditions.\nCounter-cultural spiritualities in the \nAxial Age religions\nIn this section, I briefly discuss the responses of the Axial Age \nreligions and philosophies to the then emerging imperial \nmoney and private-property economy and its effects on \npeople’s spirituality (Duchrow & Hinkelammert 2012):2\n•\t The prophets and the Torah in Israel or Judah responded \nwith the call for justice and legal provisions.\n•\t The Buddha responded with overcoming the three \npoisons of greed, aggressive hatred and the illusion of the \nego by mindful insight in the mutual interdependency of \nall beings, the new ways of living together in the Sanghas \nand admonition to the rulers.\n•\t Laozi responded with giving priority to the gentle over \nthe hard in the way of the Dao and Confucius with the \nconstant rectification of fulfilling one’s role in an ordered \nsociety. Socrates responded with putting the search for \nthe arete of the soul over wealth and reputation, Plato \nwith justice in the politeia and Aristotle with his critique \nof the chremastic accumulation of money and the ethics \nand politics of the natural economy of the house and \nexchange without accumulation.\n•\t Jesus called for the decision between God’s justice and \nthe money idol Mammon, highlighting the religious \ncharacter of money.\n•\t Muhammad condemned the illusion of limitless wealth \naccumulation, prohibited charging interest on loans \n(on the basis of the biblical heritage) and asked for the \nsharing of wealth through taxes (Zakat) in order to get \npeople out of poverty.\n1.Put together (in German) by Mascha Madörin from Omega advertisement texts \n(Madörin 1989:49).\n2. All of this is elaborated in Duchrow and Hinkelammert (2012).\nLet me summarise the response of the Jesus movement and \nthe early church on the basis of the Hebrew Bible. Historically \nit seems that the prophet Amos in the second part of the 8th \ncentury BCE was the first to react to the upcoming money and \nprivate-property economy and its spirituality. His central \ntheme was the threat to the small farmers. They were losing \ntheir possessions through seizures, being sold into slavery \nfor excessive debts whilst the women were abused as debt \nslaves etc. (cf. Am 2:6–8). Against the destruction of human \nand social relations through the mechanisms of money and \nprivate property, Amos places justice in the centre, correcting \nall power asymmetries (Am 5:24):\nLet justice roll down like waters,\nand righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.\nOther prophets of Israel and Judah followed the same line: \nHosea, Micah, Isaiah, Jeremiah. The latter identifies the \nknowledge of God with doing justice to the poor (Jr 22:16). \nThe prophets and their followers were a minority in Israel \nand Judah. It was only King Josiah who made a difference in \nthe second part of the 7th century BCE. It was under his rule \nthat the message of the prophets started to be implemented \nin the form of legal reforms that eventually led to the Torah. \nCentral to this process is the book of Deuteronomy. Here \nyou find the Decalogue, presenting God as the liberator from \nslavery and therefore demanding and protecting just human \nrelations because this is the only way in which freedom can \nbe secured (Dt 5:6–21). It is not by accident that the last of the \nTen Commandments is about greed and accumulation:\nNeither shall you covet your neighbor`s wife.\nNeither shall you desire your neighbor’s house,\nor field; or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey,\nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.\nThe socio-economic laws are found in Deuteronomy 14–15, \nlater elaborated in Leviticus 25. They contain the prohibition \nof interest, regular release of debts and slaves, et cetera. When \nthe political economy and spirituality of greed and conquest \nbecame totalitarian in the Hellenistic empires, the Jewish \nfaithful (chassidim) reacted with apocalyptic underground \nliterature characterised by resistance and hope for God’s \nintervention. The classical text for this is the book of Daniel. \nIn chapter three, we find the narrative of three Jewish men \ndefying the emperor’s demand that everybody should fall \ndown and worship the golden statue. Chapter seven tells \nabout a vision of Daniel: the empires in the shape of greedy \npredatory beasts are overcome by God’s new order coming \ndown from heaven in the shape of a human being. The \nmessage is that the human, the image of God, will have the \nvictory over the beast-like, destructive imperial order. That is \nthe hope feeding persistent resistance.\nThis is the tradition on which Jesus, his movement and the \nearly church are building new messianic communities in the \nspirit of God within the context of the Roman Empire. This \nI understand as a second wave of the Axial Age faiths and \nphilosophies. (I regard Islam as the third wave, building on \nthe biblical traditions, in the context of the Arab merchant \n', 'Original Research\ndoi:10.4102/ve.v35i3.1332http://www.ve.org.za\nPage 5 of 7\nsociety). Jesus proclaims that God’s new domination-free \norder with a human face, announced by Daniel, is beginning \nin his presence. It is the suffering, the poor and the outcast \nwho become the first subjects of this new order which turns \nthe imperial hierarchy upside down. The first will be last \nand the last will be first. He creates a spirituality of trust \nin God’s care overcoming the external and internal rule of \nMammon, the idol of collecting treasures in the form of the \naccumulation of money and property. ‘Strive first for the \nkingdom of God and God’s justice, and all these things will \nbe given to you as well’ (Mt 6:33).\nIt is important to realise that Jesus does not only liberate the \npoor to change their own lives and spirituality and build \ncommunities of solidarity, but he also acts politically in \nrelation to the existing institutions. One of his key actions in \nthis regard is the confrontation with the Jewish collaborators \nwith the Romans, the priestly elites in the temple, the central \nbank of that time (Mk 11:15–19). The key text of God’s and \nJesus’ identification with the people impoverished by and \nsuffering from economic injustice is found in Matthew \n25:31ff. Here the victims, the hungry, the thirsty et cetera \nare portrayed as the yardstick for all people and peoples to \nbe accepted in the final judgement. The judge is the Human \nOne of Daniel 7. This text is crucial for interfaith relations and \ninterfaith solidarity for justice and a new spirituality because \nthose judged are not judged by the criteria of belonging to \nthis or that religion, but by providing for the basic needs of \nthe least ones with whom Jesus identifies.\nThe early Christian communities followed Jesus on this \npath. The classical text is Acts 4:32–35. The community \nvoluntarily shares property, especially those who have \nlanded property and houses. This balancing of the relations \nwithin the community is portrayed as the fulfilment of the \nDeuteronomy Torah by quoting: ‘There was not a needy \nperson among them’ (cf. Dt 15:4).\nA key witness for our issue is the Apostle Paul. He adds \ntwo important insights to the Jesus tradition. The first is that \nreason can be co-opted by greed. In his first letter to the \nCorinthians, he shows that reason is folly when it orientates \nitself to wisdom in the service of the strong, the rich and the \nmighty. (Today we know this very well when, for example, \nscientists work in the service of Transnational Corporations \n[TNCs] to smokescreen the ecological dangers of a product \nwhich destroys ecosystems). So wisdom is only true wisdom \nwhen it orients itself to the criteria of the weak, vulnerable \nor despised, in order to be truly inclusive. Secondly, Paul \nshows in the letter to the Romans that the law, meant to \nserve life in community, can also be co-opted by greed \n(Rm 6, 7). In that case, it kills. (Today we can see this in the \ncase of debt mechanisms: when the law that debt has to be \nrepaid is made an absolute, it can kill by producing hunger \nand even death through Structural Adjustment Programs). \nTherefore, the overarching criterion for law must be love \nand solidarity. In Roman 8, Paul elaborates that the only \nway to do justice is by living in this new spirit of the Messiah \nin new messianic communities. They will revolutionise the \nRoman Empire with this new spirituality. This is the whole \npurpose of Paul’s counter-cultural mission.\nI thus summarise the core of the Hebrew Bible and the \nmessianic Second Testament in relation to human beings \nsuffering from the reality and spirituality of economic \ninjustice: it is the identification of the God of Israel and Jesus \nwith the impoverished people. Therefore, justice in the hearts \nand minds of people and justice in community relations and \ninstitutions are the key contribution of the biblical traditions \ntowards interfaith solidarity for overcoming the structural \nand spiritual sins of the prevailing civilisation.\nWhat does all this mean in the context of our searching for a \nspirituality for democracy and social cohesion today?\nSearching a spirituality for \ndemocracy and social cohesion \ntoday\nLet us first draw some conclusions from the historical review. \nThe first is that democracy and social cohesion is in principle \nnot possible in a capitalist civilisation. Here the power of \nmoney rules, systemically corrupting the economic and \npolitical institutions as well as the spirituality of the people. \nThe second is that you cannot change the situation by merely \nchanging institutions. Even if they could be changed, the \ncalculating ego-spirituality of the money-subjects would \ncorrupt them again. Similarly, you cannot change the money \nspirituality of the people without changing the structures \nbecause the structures would continue to corrupt the hearts \nand minds of the people. The third complicating factor is a \npsychological one (cf. Duchrow & Hinkelammert 2012). How \ncan you explain that the majority of the world’s population \nis suffering from social and psychological destruction by \nthe dominating system, but only a minority is standing \nup to resist and work for alternatives? Here very complex \npsychological factors play a role: leading the losers to fatality \nand the middle-class to illusions in their consciousness. What \ncould be a way out?\nThe starting point must be that the capitalist civilisation is \ndeath-bound. If it were to continue, humanity and earth \nwill stumble from one catastrophe to the next until the \nearth could not bear human life any more. The reason is \nvery simple. Capital is defined by the dynamics that it must \ngrow without limits. This is the single most important factor \ncreating the necessity of economic growth. Under industrial \nconditions, this cannot happen without material throughput \nwhich needs natural resources and produces waste. How can \nanything grow without limits in a finite world? This means \nthat our 3000-year-old civilisation must be transformed into \na post-capitalist new culture or die.\nHowever, this argument by itself will neither create a \nconversion (metanoia) of people’s hearts and minds, nor will \nit create the political will to change institutions. It just creates \n', 'Original Research\ndoi:10.4102/ve.v35i3.1332http://www.ve.org.za\nPage 6 of 7\nfear and stimulates the drive for short-range immediate \nsurvival and gain. What is needed is the long-range horizon \nof any search for a new spirituality as well as for a new \npolitical economy, namely a post-capitalist culture. In order \nto complement this ambiguous long-range perspective by a \nmore motivating one, it is necessary to create opportunities \nfor people to experience that post-capitalist behaviour, \nmentality and socio-economic structures offer a better quality \nof life. This means that the local-regional level is a privileged \narea from which a new spirituality, economy and politics \nmust emerge – in spite of the fact that, simultaneously and \nfinally, the global system must be changed. The present \nsystem is constructed top-down. The alternative can only be \ndeveloped bottom-up.\nNow let us look into some of the details of developing a \nspirituality for democracy and social cohesion today. If it \nis true that the pillars of the dominating system are money \nand private property linked with egocentric individualism, \nimperial and patriarchal violence, it is at these points that \ntheology has its crucial tasks today.\nThe key for a new money order is that money must be turned \nfrom a commodity for accumulation into a public good \nservicing the real economy and managed democratically. It \nhas to be an instrument for exchange and credit, not a goal. \nThis is already practiced on local and regional levels with \nregional, interest-free parallel currencies. In the long run, it \nhas to be envisaged at the global level too. Keynes already \nproposed this in 1944 at the Bretton Woods conference when \nhe suggested a global central bank with the reserve currency \n‘bancor’. The USA at that point rejected this proposal because \nthey wanted the dollar to be world money. As the present \nfinancial system will move from one crisis to the next, a \nmoment may come when Keynes’ proposal will have a \nchance. The banks in a new order will have only the role \nof managers of public money, not as the winners through \ninterest, speculation, et cetera without labour. This is already \nhappening on a small scale with cooperative and democratic \nbanks. In Austria, a democratic bank is just in the stage of \nbeing implemented, called ‘Bank for the Common Good’ \n(cf. http://www.demokratische-bank.at/).\nA new property order will be built on the commons, the world \nas a gift to be used for life not as privatised commodity. This \nstarts with land, water, air and seed but includes common \ncultural goods produced by collectives such as the internet. \nConsequently all basic goods and services for the satisfaction \nof basic needs of people must be public, including transport, \neducation and health. It does not mean that all this should \nbe turned into state property. Public property must and can \nbe organised as near to the affected people as possible. There \nare many legal forms by which this can be done (Duchrow & \nHinkelammert 2004). Together with the struggle against the \nempire and serving capital, the struggle against privatisation \nis the main alliance partner besides initiatives building up \nsuch new order from below.\nWithout developing economic democracy, there will be no \nreal political democracy. The only way to overcome the \npresent situation is to rebuild the political institutions from \nbelow on the material basis of economic democracy. In this \nway, state institutions are being subjected to the criteria of \nthe social, economic, ecological and cultural human rights \nfrom the start and not only in a secondary manner. All of \nthese criteria have one reference point: the right to life. The \nsubjects, therefore, have to be real human beings, not just \nthe property owners. Whoever wants to implement human \nrights must join the struggle to overcome capitalism. Postcapitalist\npolitical institutions have to be built up, and this \nis possible. Representative democracy will, in this way, \nbe complemented by economic, direct and participatory \ndemocracy. This presupposes that all movements engaged \nin the struggles have to have a political dimension. They \nhave to reappropriate the very term ‘democracy’, which \ncapitalism has hijacked. Realising that capitalism and \ndemocracy are irreconcilable, the movements have to \nliberate democracy from its perversion.3\nIn this context, theology has a crucial role in transforming \nthe egocentric money spirituality of people by demonstrating \nhow mutual relationships in cooperation, empathy and \nsolidarity are the basis for a good human life (buen vivir). \nHere all original sources of the Axial Age religions radiate \nan abundant spiritual power. However, these will not be \ngrasped by people just by informing them. The insight of \nliberation theologies, that practice is the starting and end \npoint of doing theology, turns out to be crucial in this regard.\nHow do we go from the old to the new order of becoming \nhuman in solidarity and creating a humane society?4 The key \nbridge is the solidarity protest movements, resistance and the \nwork for alternatives. They are the emerging subject (change \nagent) that rejects and transforms the totalitarian functional \nmechanisms of cost-benefit calculation, which are the law \nthat kills. They represent the various aspects of the social \nand psychological destruction that cause suffering to people, \nsocieties and our planet. They form the countervailing power \nthat aims at responding to the holistic personal and social \nneeds that are neglected by the disembedded capitalist \neconomy. They care for society and Mother Earth as a whole. \nJoining them is the way to healing the fatality and illusion. In \nthis way, people become acting subjects, reappropriating the \nstolen resources for the common good, liberating themselves \nfrom the psychological and mental distortions caused by \nthe system. This means that people cannot be healed from \ntheir egocentric spirituality individually. The goal is the way. \nWithout walking and working together in concrete terms, \nthey cannot experience the better quality of life in postcapitalist\nbehaviour and structures.\nEmpirically this is initially possible at points where people \nare touched directly in their basic material conditions of \n3.The political theory for this approach has been developed by Enrique Dussel’s (2008) \npolitics of liberation.\n4.For the following, cf. chapter 12 in Duchrow and Hinkelammert (2012).\n', 'Original Research\ndoi:10.4102/ve.v35i3.1332http://www.ve.org.za\nPage 7 of 7\nlife. From here, they can expand their engagement into \nthe transformation of systemic economic and political \ninstitutions. Worldwide there are a host of local-regional \npost-capitalist socioeconomic alternatives. One key concept \nin this regard is (social) solidarity economy (Arruda 2008). In \nBrazil, solidarity economy has even achieved public support. \nThe Lula government established a State Secretariat for \nSolidarity Economy, supporting the civil-society networks. \nThe year 2006 saw a joint conference on the subject, bringing \ngovernment and movements together.\nThere are four areas in particular in which alternative localregional\nalternatives can flourish (cf. Douthwaite 1996):\n•\t post-capitalist ways to deal with exchange and money\n•\t cooperative banking\n•\t alternative energy\n•\t local production, marketing and consumption.\nOn the larger level of society, there are strategic points of \ndeparture for concrete popular struggles. These include:\n•\t work for all – against unemployment\n•\t gender justice – against sexism\n•\t life-giving agriculture – against agribusiness\n•\t the supply of public goods and services – against \nprivatisation\n•\t solidarity social insurance – against capital-based pension \nfunds\n•\t tax justice – against bottom-up redistribution\n•\t eco-justice – against destroying the earth.\nThese kinds of struggles are the breeding ground for \ndeveloping a spirituality for democracy and social cohesion. \nFor South Africa, the subversive memory of the United \nDemocratic Front (UDF) against apartheid could be of help. \nIt was in this context that new theological and spiritual \ndiscoveries like the South African Kairos Document of 1985 \nor the development of Muslim liberation theology were \nmade (cf. Esack 1997). What would happen if all existing \nefforts for local-regional post-capitalist alternatives and \nall the ongoing and popular struggles would form a new \nUnited Front for Post-capitalist Democracy and Social \nCohesion (UFD)? Would this praxis not be a testing ground \nfor all faith communities in the country to rediscover the \nanti-Mammon spirituality of their original sources of the \nAxial Age as a counter-cultural resource in the common \nstruggle against death-bound capitalism and for a new \nbase-democratic culture of life?\nConclusion\nRecent research has shown that the introduction of money \ninto daily life economies during the Axial Age has had \ndramatic consequences not only for the economy but also for \nsocial and political life as well as for the whole of civilisation. \nIt became the roots of modernity and has reached a climax \nin financial capitalism. As this civilisation turns out to be \nunsustainable, even to threaten life on earth, a whole new \nculture of life has to be developed. As this must be based \non a new spirituality transcending the calculating mentality \nof the money civilisation, the role of religion becomes \ncrucial. Whilst the majority of religions have assimilated the \nmoney civilisation, liberation theologies within all religions \ngo back to the responses of the original, reacting critically \nagainst the social, political and spiritual consequences of \nthe new economy. This includes a new theory of religion \nand also shows practical ways of participatory democracy, \ndemocratising the economy, regaining social cohesion and \ndeveloping a life-giving culture. New interdisciplinary \nresearch in religious, economic and political studies can \nbuild on these findings. Particularly, a new field of contextual \nstudies is opened on religions and the political economy.\nAcknowledgements\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that he has no financial or personal \nrelationship(s) that may have inappropriately influenced \nhim in writing this article.\nReferences\nArmstrong, K., 2006, The great transformation: The beginning of our religious \ntraditions, Anchor Books/Random House, New York.\nArruda, M.
