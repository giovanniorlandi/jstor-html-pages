To prepare and study the distribution of magnetic nanoliposomes of Sesquiterpene-Rich Fraction from Cichorium\nglandulosum (SRF-MLN) (under magnetic field) in the main organs of mice. Methods. The SRF-MLN was prepared by ethanol\ninjection-sonication precipitation method. The quality of its pharmaceutical properties was investigated by the active ingredient\nlactucin. The drug concentration and distribution of lactucin in different tissues and organs including whole blood, liver, heart,\nspleen, lung, and kidney were evaluated with Sesquiterpene-Rich Fraction from Cichorium glandulosum (SRF-LP) as a control.\nResults. The prepared SRF-MLN was spherical and monodispersed with an average particle diameter of 65 ± 1 nm, encapsulation\nefficiency of 91.3% ± 1.5% (RSD% = 1.5), and drug loading rate of 4.7% ± 0.3% (RSD% = 0.7). Dispersion coefficient PDI was 0.157\nand Zeta potential was−17.5mV.The lactucin concentration of SRF-MLN after 10min of intravenous injection in heart, liver, spleen,\nlung, and kidney was significantly higher than that of SRF-LP group.The AUC\n0-12h values of liver tissue were obviously higher than\nother tissues and MRT was significantly prolonged under the action of the magnetic field (p<0.01). Conclusion. The prepared SRFMLN\ncan change the distribution of drugs in different tissues and organs, prolonging the action time of the drugs in the body, and\nit has certain specificity under the action of applied magnetic field.\n1. Background\nThe liver is an important organ involved in the process of\ndigestion, excretion, detoxification, and immunity. It is prone\nto all kinds of metabolic and infectious diseases and primary\nand secondary tumors. There is a high incidence of liver\ndiseases in China. Liver diseases have become common and\nfrequent and could lead to severe liver failure and hepatic\nencephalopathy, which severely threaten the human health\nwith high morbidity and mortality. Though there have been\nmany drugs used for the treatment of liver diseases, some of\nthem have problems such as lack of specificity, intensive toxic\nside effects, or instability in the body, which have limited their\nclinical application. Therefore, exploring effective treatment\nfor liver disease has become a research hotspot.\nHepatic targeted drug delivery system (HTDDS), which\neffectively delivers the drug to the lesion of the liver, can\nreduce the dosage and the number of administration times,\nimprove the therapeutic index of the drug, and reduce the\nadverse reaction. The application of a special carrier is the\nprimarymeans of liver-targeted drug transport.Themagnetic\nnanocarrier carries the therapeutic agent to the target site\nwith the aid of a magnetic field, which allows the therapeutic\nagent to concentrate in the target area and reduces the distribution\nof the drug at other sites, and thereby could enhance\nthe curative effect and reduce the dosage and the side effects\nHindawi\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nVolume 2018, Article ID 8549519, 6 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8549519\n', '2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nof drugs [1–6]. Due to its good biocompatibility, nontoxicity,\nbiodegradability, and goodmagnetic field response, magnetic\nnanoliposomes are widely used in the field of biomedicine.\nCichorium glandulosum Boiss. et Huet is the Chicory\nplant in Asteraceae family, which is widely cultivated in\nXinjiang, China. There are two species of Cichorium genus,\nC. glandulosum Boiss. et Huet and C. intybus L., collected\nin the 2015 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Their\nseeds, aerial parts, and roots have been used in traditional\nUyghur medicine for the treatment of jaundice with dampheat\npathogen, stomach pain and low food intake and edema\noliguria. They proved to have the functions of clearing\naway liver-fire and gallbladder-heat, removing stagnated\nfood by using stamachics, and inducing diuresis to reduce\nedema. Flavonoids, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, coumarins,\nalkaloids, sterols, and other active ingredients have been\nreported in these two plants [7–12]. Our research group\nhas performed the investigations on Cichorium glandulosum\nfor more than ten years [13–15]. In the present study, the\naerial parts of C. glandulosum were extracted, purified by\nmacroporous resin to obtain the effective fraction of C.\nglandulosum total sesquiterpene (SRF) with the protective\nactivity of liver injury by efficacy tracking method. Due to the\nlow SRF yield (about 0.8%), it is difficult for common dosage\nforms to reach effective plasma concentrations at the target\nsite. In this experiment, SRF was used as a model drug to\nprepare the magnetic nanoliposomes of C. glandulosum total\nsesquiterpene (SRF-MLN) by ethanol injection-ultrasound\nprecipitation. Under the applied magnetic field, the distribution\nof SRF-MLN in liver, heart, spleen, lung, kidney, and\nother tissues and organs was studied after its injection inmice\ntail vein and also was compared with the liposomes of C.\nglandulosum total sesquiterpene (SRF-LP).\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Instruments. The instruments used are Agilent 1260High\nPerformance Liquid Chromatography (Agilent Technologies,\nUSA), Millipore Simplicity-185 Ultra Water Purifier (Millipore\nCorporation, USA), JIN92-IINUltrasonic Cell Shredder\n(Ningbo Xinzhi Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), and Nano S90\nLaser Particle Size Analyzer (British Malvern).\n2.2. Materials. Soy lecithin was purchased from German\nlipoid company; hydrogenated soy lecithin was purchased\nfrom Japan Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd.; cholesterol was purchased\nfrom China Huixing Biochemical Reagent Co., Ltd.;\nlactucin control is homemade; methanol and acetonitrile\nwere purchased fromFisher, USA; the remaining reagents are\nof analytical grade.\n2.3. Methods\n2.3.1. Preparation of SRF-MLN. Soybean lecithin, hydrogenated\nsoybean lecithin, and cholesterol were accurately\nweighed and put in conical flask, then the total sesquiterpene\nethanol solution 10mL was added, ultrasonic Cell Shredder\nwas used for 5 minutes to completely dissolve it, 2 mL\nof phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.4) was added, with\nmagnetic stirring (60∘C) for 45 min, shaking off ethanol,\nprobe ultrasound (400 W) was used 150 times, and the total\nsesquiterpene common liposomes (SRF-LP) were obtained.\nThe prepared SRF-LP was injected into a suspension of 2%\nTween-80 Fe\n3\nO\n4\nmagnetic nanoparticles at a flow rate of 2\nmL/min, being shaken at 55∘C for 30 min and allowed to\nstand for 1h to obtain SRF-MLN.\n2.4. Determination of Average Particle Size, Distribution,\nand Zeta Potential of SRF-MLN. After appropriate amount\nof SRF-MLN had been measured and making suspension\ndilution with water, a laser particle size analyzer was used to\ndetermine the size, distribution, and Zeta potential.\n2.5. Encapsulation Rate and Drug Loading Rate. Precision\ndrawing 3 mL of shaped drug was loaded on the treated\nSephadexG-50 column (inner diameter 1cm, length 27 cm),\neluted with pH 7.4 PBS, the volume flow rate was 1mL/min,\nand the drug-containing liposomes and free drug were\ncollected. In addition, the same batch of raw drug absolute\nethanol solution was diluted with PBS solution (pH 7.4) at a\nratio of 1:3. The peak area was measured by injecting 10 𝜇L of\nHPLC, respectively, and the amount of drug in the liposome\nand the amount of free drug were calculated.\nEncapsulation rate (%) = liposomal drug content/(liposomal\ndrug content + amount of free drug) x 100%\nDrug loading rate (%) = liposomal drug content/(liposomal\ndrug content+ accessories amount) x 100%\n2.6. Drug Determination of Blood and\nVarious Tissues and Organs\n2.6.1. Sampling and Administration. Kunming mice 120 (purchased\nfrom the Experimental Animal Center of Xinjiang,\nChina), weighing 22∼24g, were randomly divided into 18\ngroups, each group of 5, of which 6 were NS administration\ngroups, 6 were total sesquiterpene liposomes (SRF-LP)\nadministration groups, and the other 6 were total sesquiterpene\nmagnetic nanoliposomes (SRF-MLN) administration\ngroups and the loss area was put in magnetic field (a circular\nmagnet with a diameter of 5 mm and a surface magnetic field\nof 2500 Gauss was fixed on the bilateral skin surface of mice).\nSRF, SRF-LP, and SRF-MLN were administered 0.5mL at 20\nmg/kg of the same dose of mice tail vein, after administration\nof 0.083, 0.167, 0.333, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h, blood and\nsome organs were collected and animals were sacrificed. The\namount of lactucin was measured by HPLC.\n2.6.2. Determination of Lactucin by HPLC. Lactucin was\ndetermined byHPLCas follows: columnmolecular: Kromasil\n100-5 C\n18\ncolumn (4.6mm × 250mm, 5 𝜇m); guard column:\nFusion-RP 4 × 3.0mm; mobile phase: methanol (A) − 0.2%\nformic acid (B) gradient elution (0∼30min, 15%∼28%A; 30∼\n40min, 28%∼15% A); wavelength of detection: 256 nm; flow\nrate: 1mL/min; column temperature: 35∘C; injection volume:\n20 𝜇L; theoretical plate height: not less than 3000 degrees of\nlactucin.\n', 'Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\nThe chromatograms of blank whole blood and tissue\nextracts showed no other impurity peaks at the peak of the\ndrug, indicating no interference with the drug assay.\nThe linear regression equation was A = 30324C + 840.15\n(r = 0.9999) with the peak area A as the ordinate and\nthe concentration C as the abscissa. The linear range was\n1.0−240.5 𝜇g ∙ mL−1. The recoveries of three high, middle,\nand low concentrations of lactucin were (98.1 ± 2.3)%, (99.8±\n2.7)%, and (103.3 ± 2.2)%, respectively. The repeatability and\nstability were 1.8% and 2.4%, respectively.\n2.6.3. Sample Processing\nBlood Collection. By using an anesthetic vaporizer (RC-2\nRodent Circuit Controller, VetEquip, Pleasanton, CA), mice\nwere anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation in an induction\nbox (15cm∗10cm∗10cm Chamber, product no. V100, RWD\nLife Science Co., Ltd, China) at 2.5% to 3% and maintained\nat 1% to 2% isoflurane through a nosecone (Bubble Tubing\nNosecone, small to medium mouse [9 mm], product no.\n921609, VetEquip) on a Bain nonrebreathing circuit (PediBain\n45-in., product no. 921410, VetEquip). The mice were\nconfirmed to be at a surgical plane of anesthesia through the\nlack of a pedal reflex (no response to a firm toe pinch).\n(1) The left thumb and the index finger grasp the ears of\nthe mouse and the skin behind the neck, and the little\nfinger fixes the tail.\n(2) The middle finger gently presses the left forelimb of\nthe mouse on the sternal heart, and the ring finger\npresses on the abdomen. The thumb shakes and\ngently presses around the eyeball to make the eyeball\ncongestion.\n(3) Use the elbow to pick up the eyeball.\n(4) Tilt the direction of the thumb and forefinger as\nneeded to allow blood to flow vertically from the\neyelid at different speeds into the centrifuge tube.\n(5) Simultaneously press the heart part of the mouse with\nthe left middle finger to speed up the pumping speed\nof the heart.\n(6) When the blood is exhausted, the mice are sacrificed\nby dislocation.\nTissue Collection and Processing. Heart, liver, spleen, lung, and\nkidney were cut with accurate amount of 0.1 g, respectively.\nWe added saline (w/v = 1:3), ultrasonic cell mill homogenate,\neach sample for 3 min, centrifuged for 10 min, took supernatant\n200 𝜇L, added methanol 1.0 mL, dense plug, vortex\nmixed for 3 min, centrifuged in high-speed centrifuge (12000\nrpm) for 15 min, and the supernatant in the 40∘C water bath\nnitrogen flow, dried with 100 𝜇L of methanol, and took 20 𝜇L\nof sample.\nThe examination methods of all samples were mentioned\npreviously in Section 2.5.\n2.7. Statistical Analysis. All data were analyzed with SPSS\n(version 4.0.100.1124; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA)\nFigure 1: Transmission electron microscopy of SRF-MLN.\nsoftware and were shown as mean values ± SD. Statistical\ncomparisons were performed to determine group difference\nthrough ANOVA. Significant difference between two groups\nwas evaluated by the Student’s t-test. Statistical significance\nwas set as follows: P, 0.05 and P, 0.01.\n3. Results\n3.1. Physical andChemical Properties of SRF-MLN. SRF-MLN\nsolution was translucent and the average particle size was\n(65±1nm), dispersion coefficient PDIwas 0.157, Zeta potential\nwas −17.5 mV, encapsulation efficiency was 91.3% ± 1.5%\n(RSD%=0.7), and loadingwas 4.7% ± 0.3%.Themorphology\nof SRF-MLN observed by transmission electron microscope\n(TEM) showed that the center of SRF-MLN was obviously\nwrapped with magnetic nanoparticles and in spherical and\nmonodisperse distribution, as shown in Figure 1.\n3.2. Tissue Distribution of Drugs in the Body\n3.2.1. Standard Curve and Linear Range. 0.1 g of each tissue,\nhomogenized with physiological saline, was added to the\nworking fluid 20 𝜇L, equivalent to the plasma concentrations\nof 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 𝜇g/mL of the tissue standard\nsolution. According to the above sample processing methods,\nthey were measured by HPLC and linear regression analysis\nwas carried out with the peak area (Y) of the standard as the\nordinate and the concentration (C) as the abscissa.The results\nare shown in Table 1.\n3.2.2. Tissue Distribution of Drug in Mice. The amount of\ndrug (𝜇g) per gram tissue was calculated based on the\ndetermination of the concentration of the drug in the tissue,\nsee Figures 2 and 3. The area under the curve (AUC\n0-12)\nand mean residence time (MRT) were calculated by the\ntrapezoidal area method according to the time-concentration\nchanges in the organs and tissues. The results are shown in\nTable 2.\nIt can be seen from Figures 2 and 3 that the content of\nlactucin in the liver, heart, spleen, lung, and kidney of SRFMLN\ngroup was higher than that of SRF-LP group.\n', '4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nTable 1: The standard curve of lactucin in different groups.\ntissue standard curve R2\nblood Y = 38.533X + 0.765 0.9994\nliver Y = 39.248X + 0.705 0.9985\nheart Y = 39.212X + 0.298 0.9939\nspleen Y = 40.261X + 0.439 0.9991\nlung Y = 40.256X − 0.231 0.996\nkidney Y = 38.382X + 0.301 0.9968\nTable 2: AUC\n0-12h and MRT values in tissues.\ntissues SRF-LP SRF-MLN SRF-LP SRF-MLN\nblood 2.3769±0.4281 4.0819±3.2735 4.4439±0.6556 5.0875±0.6771\nliver 3.0093±0.2127 32.063±4.5521 3.7804±0.1488 10.049±1.3722\nheart 1.5428±0.1129 1.6408±0.2227 2.5809±0.0876 3.0996±0.4522\nspleen 0.7503±0.1516 1.7894±0.1995 2.9247±0.3448 7.5432±0.5365\nlung 0.824±0.1228 2.2061±0.2236 2.6645±0.2167 7.2248±0.6571\nkidney 0.7176±0.1205 1.9651±0.2788 2.8994±0.0891 5.7854±0.4559\n\ue3b8\n\ue3b7.\ue3b8\n\ue3b7\n\ue3b6.\ue3b8\n\ue3b6\n\ue3b5.\ue3b8\n\ue3b5\n\ue3b4.\ue3b8\n\ue3b4\n\ue3b3.\ue3b8\n\ue3b3\n0.083 h\n0.167 h\n0.333 h\n0.5 h\n2 h\n1 h\n4 h\n6 h\n12 h\nLiver Heart Spleen Lung Kidney\nOrgan\nC\non\nce\nnt\nra\ntio\nn \n(\ue328\ng/\ng)\nFigure 2: SRF-LP distribution in various organs of mice.\n0.083 h\n0.167 h\n0.333 h\n0.5 h\n2 h\n1 h\n4 h\n6 h\n12 h\nLiver Heart Spleen Lung\nOrgan\nKidney\n\ue3b7\ue3b3\n\ue3b6\ue3b8\n\ue3b6\ue3b3\n\ue3b5\ue3b8\n\ue3b5\ue3b3\n\ue3b4\ue3b8\n\ue3b4\ue3b3\n\ue3b8\n\ue3b3\n−\ue3b8\nC\non\nce\nnt\nra\ntio\nn \n(\ue328\ng/\ng)\nFigure 3: SRF-MLN distribution in various organs of mice.\n', 'Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5\nIt can be seen from Table 2 that both AUC\n0-12h and\nMRT were higher in SRT-MLN mice than those in SRF-LP\nmice.

Discussions\nIn this study, the magnetic nanoliposomes were prepared\nby ethanol injection combined with ultrasound precipitation\nusing the Sesquiterpene-Rich Fraction from C. glandulosum\n(SRF) which showed protective activity against liver injury.\nThe liposomes were uniform spherical particles and the\nparticle size was less than 100 nm. After the SRF was made\ninto magnetic nanoliposomes, it was conducive for the active\ningredient to be delivered targeted to the lesion site, which\nreduced the distribution of the drug in other sites and the side\neffects of the drug.\nThe results of in vivo distribution showed that with the\nchange of administration time, the content of lactucin in\ndifferent dosage forms showed the same trend in heart, liver,\nspleen, lung, and kidney. The content of lactucin gradually\nincreased in SRF-MLN group than that in SRF-LP group, and\nthe content increased in the liver was particularly notable. It\nshowed that the prepared SRF-MLN in the animal body had\ngood magnetic response under the action of the magnetic\nfield, which could significantly improve the distribution of\nthe effective component of C. glandulosum in the tissue of\nmice, especially in the liver. Prepared liver-targeted magnetic\nliposomes could delay the elimination of lactucin in\nbody to improve the bioavailability with a certain sustained\nrelease.\nHowever, a series of in-depth studies should be further\ncarried out for the magnetic nanoliposomes to be\napplied clinically. Although there are still many problems\nto be solved regarding magnetic targeted drug delivery,\nthe research contents of this project can provide some\nguidance and demonstrations for the preparation and study\nof novel liver-targeted drug delivery carriers in Uyghur\nmedicine.\nAbbreviations\nSRF: Sesquiterpene-Rich Fraction from\nCichorium glandulosum\nSRF-LP: Liposomes of Sesquiterpene-Rich Fraction\nfrom Cichorium glandulosum\nSRF-MLN: Magnetic nanoliposomes of\nSesquiterpene-Rich Fraction from\nCichorium glandulosum\nTE: Targeting efficiency\nRTE: Relative targeting efficiency\nTI: Targeting index\nMRT: Mean residence time\nRSD: Relative standard deviation\nHTDDS: Hepatic targeted drug delivery system\nAUC: Area under curve.\nData Availability\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are\navailable from the corresponding author upon request.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was supported by the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (Grant no. 81303307).\nReferences\n[1] A.
