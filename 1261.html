November 20.—An\norder signed on the Isthmus of Pan\nama by President Roosevelt making\nradical changes in the organization\nof affairs of government for the Canal\nZone, was made public today at the\noffices of the commission. The efft\'et\nof the order Is to place the canal\nwork and the government of the\nzone under the direction of Chairman\nKhontz, aided by chiefs of bureaus,\nwho will report directly to the com\nmission. thus eliminating the office of\nGovernor.\nThe executive committee of three\nmembers, each the head of a depart\nment, has been abolished, and In its\nstead seven departments are created\nand the chief of each will report and\nreceive Instructions from the chair\nman of the commission.\nThe President will take up the\nquestion of the appointment of a now\ncommission upon his return to Wash\nington.\nChief Engineer Stevens wilt be\nsecond in authority and will act in\nChairman Shinns\' absence . The gen\neral counsel will exercise the authori\nty heretofore invested In the governor\nof the zone.\nTHE VALUE OF\nBEING ALONE\nIt was an observation of Emerson,\nsomewhere, that it wns a good thing\nfor a inan to he alone, occasionally,\nso he could reflect ami think out the\nproblems about him. Hut this Is not\nthe usual habit of men they almost\nrefuse to lie alone. If they discover\nthemselves In that condition .they\nare not satisfied until they And some\none to lie with or to talk to. There\nis value in being alone occasionally,\nfor then is the time to think out\nsuch questions as: Who am I? What\nuni I? What am I doing? What value\nIs my life? How may I do better?\nThere are several Important questions\nof this nature that comes to a man,\nwhen he is alone, If he is anything of\na man, or can take on a reflective\nmood. They are not likely to come\nto him at any other time.\nIll answering these questions one\nmay require the assistance of many\nrules and facts, ami then Is the only\ntime they will come to him to tnke\npart in his life, it is one of these\nmoments when a man arranges his\nchart, finds out the direction of the\nbreezes, selects Ills star to steer by, j\nor discovers the varation of the nee\ndle before he starts on his voyage.\nThen Is when a true, an axiom, a mor\nal rule, lias time to get in its work. It\nhas a better chance then, than when\nout in the palaver, din and bicker\nof small minds. This gives solitude\nat times a sanctity which touches\nassociation with a grateful influence\nand diffuses its glow over all one’s\nacts. Then be alone sotm-llracs;\nlet Hill Jones keep away ;talk to\nyourself; ami if you do it honestly\nand sincerely you may find a better\nfriend than you thought you had.—\nOhio Stato Journal.\nAFTER THE ELECTION.\nNow*, good friends nnd neighbors\nnil, we have gottep through with\none of those costly and bothersome\n"campaigns” which, with some trifl\ning additions In the way of taxes, is\nthe price we pay for civil government.\nIt Is a hlg price because It comes ,\nover-often to disturb the regular\ncourse of industry among us, to break\nup our habits of thought and as\nsociation, to disturb our domestic\nroutine. But perhaps, after all. It\nIs worth It. With all Its Inronven- j\nlences It nevertheless gives us the\nbest government under the sun; with\nall its delinquencies It preserves for\nus at essential points what our fore\nbears fought for at Bunker Mill, nt\nBrandywine nnd nt the Oowpens.\nBothersome though It be at the\npoints of industrial nnd mental dis\nturbance, It gives us something to\nthink about, and Is therefore both\nmentally nnd morally stlmuflnt.lng.\nWhatever faults time and events may\nhavo loaded upon our politics, we\nhave still a system under which n\nRelf-respecting man may hold Up his\nhead, and under which he may store\nup his savings and rear his children\nIn confidence and hope.\nPolities Is not the business of this\ncountry It Is rather a side Interest;\nvery exacting In Its demands, to be\nsure, but nevertheless only a side\nInterest. There are some unfortu\nnates who make a trade of It, some\nwho get n precarious living through\nIt; hut the most of us of the self\nsupporting, self-respecting type get\nour bread and our pudding by In\ndustry. The country is safe now for\na while nt least, and In the comfort\nof this assurance let us turn to our\nnormal tasks- let ns, If we may bor\nrow phrase which already has done\nservice, concentrate on more Impor\ntant things.— Fix.\nIn an Interview at San Antonio,\nTex., W. H llearst said yesterday\nthat he will never again be a candi\ndate, though he will continue to\nadvocate the principles for which he\nhas made a fight. ,\nTROUF GOES TO\nSEE BRYAN.\nTALK I’ROUKKHSIVK LKAGt\'K\nlilT WON\'T SAY WHAT\nTHKY SAID.\nAlexander Troup of New Haven,\nwho wns prominent at the recent\nmeeting of the New Kngland demo\ncmtir progressive league at Boston,\nat which democratic presidential\npossibility** wore discussed, arrived\nIn Lincoln. Neb., yesterday to tell\nW. J. Bryan abotit that meeting.\nNotthei Mr. Troup nor Mr. Bryan\nwould say the Boston gathering had\nany particular candidate in view, and\nMr. Bryan said last night that ho had\nnot yet discussed the objects of the\nprogressive league, of which Mr.\nTroup Is president. He said I ho vis\nit was a social one. Mr. Troup is ac\ncompanied by Mrs Troup, and thoy\nwill be the guests of Mr. and Mrs.\nBryan at Falrwlev for several days.\nHOUSEHOLD ExT\nPPNSESINCREASE\nHarper\'s Bazar Itas been publishing\nduring the last summer and autumn\nan exceedingly Interesting and prac\ntical symposium in which Bazar rea\nders toll how they are meeting the\nIncreased expense of living In eases\nwhere there is no corresponding in\ncrease. The following Instance, from\ntlio December Bazar, is a typical one:\n“The expense of living Itas increased;\nour income lias not. This Increase has\nbeen met by iih in the following ways:\nWe give almost $25 less to the church\nand the various benevolences than we\nused to. Formerly we spent about\n$25 a year for magazines and books.\nTo-day We scarcely spend $5, depend\ning upon the library, for nearly all\nour reading. Wo save certainly $25\nby doing less entertaining than for\nmerly.\n\'I have saved about $60 by keeping\na maid only half the year, whore* for\nmerly as wo kept one nil the time. I\nhave her during the summer and fall.\nWhen I do not wish to he In the hot\nkliehen and do want to ho out of\ndoors. We save perhaps $13 a year\nby not going to so many entertain\nmonts and concerts lnd<*ed, we\nhave cut these out almost entirely.\nWe simply cannot afford them.\n“Wo spend some $10 loss for vaca\ntion and travel. | save perhaps $23\na year by making ove$- my own,\nelolhes and others which friends givo\nme for children where, formerly we\nwere accustomed to buy them ready\nmade. Ii means lots of work, hut\nH is much cheaper and the clothes\nwear better.\n“This accounts for about $213 of\nthe $213 that must bo saved on ac\ncount of the Increased cost of living\nThe other $30 is money that we do\nnot save. Where formerly wo tried\nto put away $80 to $100 for a rainy\nday and forTild age. now the best that\nwo can do Is to save $30.”\nTHE DEEPEST\nMINING SHAFTS.\n“It Is probably a fact not gene\nrally known.” says the Bulletin of\nthe American iron and flt<*el Asso\nciation. “that the Michigan copper\ncountry possesses the world’s three\ndeepest vertical mining shafts. The\ndeepest of these Is the No. 3 at the\nNorth Tamarack property, its meas\nurement being 3200 feet—80 less\nthan a mile. To the south, at a dis\ntance of 1000 feet, Ik the No. 3 shaft\nof the same company. This ranks ns\nibe second deepest vertical shaft on\n• he globe, its measurement being\n\'080 from the collar to tbe bottom\nof the level. Second only to these\ntreat openings Is the Bed Jacket\nrhnft of the Calumet and Hocla com\npany, which Is down 1000 feet, and\nIn which the copper lode was not\n•acoiintered until a depth of 3300\nfeet had been attained The deepest\nincline shaft in the world Is the No.\n1 of the Calumet nnd Heela. This\nshaft llself, from the collar to the\nlowest level. Is sunk on the plane of\nthe lode for a distance of 8100 feet,\nwhile from a drift at the bottom a\nwinze extends downward 100 feet to\nthe boundary (if the property, giving\na measurement of K290 feet from the\n- rface.

The sentence required only\na few moments.\nHardy Is apparently resigned to his\nfate and it is not thought that ho\n"111 make any effnri to take the case\nto a higher court and It Is not thought\nthat it would result differently should\nhe take It up.
