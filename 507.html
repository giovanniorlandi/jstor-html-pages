        <pre>['Aided by the United States after World War II , Japan soon rehabilitated \nher economy and in 1958 she began a program of economic aid to the nations \nof Asia. Unfortunately, her neighbors “still have lingering suspicions of what \nthe Japanese are up to, fearing a possible revival of Nipponese imperialism and \nmilitarism.”\nJapan’s Role in South Asia\nBy T heodore M gN elly\nAssociate Professor of Government and Politics, University of Maryland\nT\nI APAN, the enemy of the United States \nI in World War II, is now our principal \nJ  ally in Asia. She has received significant \nmilitary and economic aid from the United \nStates, has rebuilt her economy, and is herself \nnow launching a many-faceted program of \naid for the developing countries. How the \nUnited States contributed to the postwar \neconomic miracle in Japan and how Japan’s \neconomy may contribute to the future pros\xad\nperity and security of Southeast Asia are the \nsubjects of this article.\nAt the end of World War II, the Japanese \npeople were hungry; unemployment was \nwidespread; and millions of soldiers and \ncivilians were repatriated to Japan, aggra\xad\nvating these problems. The large cities, and \nmany of their homes and factories, were de\xad\nstroyed. Large investments in China, Man\xad\nchuria, Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere were \nlost. Japan’s once great merchant marine \nhad been destroyed or sunk. The economic \nfuture of Japan, an overpopulated have-not \nnation without the natural resources essen\xad\ntial for industrial development, looked bleak.\nThe United States’ first postwar policies \nfor Japan did not evision economic aid for \nthe loser of the war.\nThe policies of Japan brought down upon the \npeople great economic destruction and confronted \nthem with the prospect of economic difficulty and \nsuffering [it was conceded, but] the plight of\nJapan is the direct outcome of its own behavior, \nand the Allies will not undertake the burden of \nrepairing the damage.\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme \nCommander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), \nwas explicitly instructed not to assume any \nresponsibility for the rehabilitation of Japan \nor the strengthening of the Japanese economy, \nand he was to make it clear that the Allies \nassumed “no obligation to maintain a par\xad\nticular standard of living.” “Economic de\xad\nmilitarization” was to be enforced to destroy \nthe economic basis of Japanese military \nstrength.\nWhen MacArthur requested food imports \nto prevent civil unrest which might endanger \nthe occupying forces, he was bitterly criti\xad\ncized by several members of the Far Eastern \nCommission, the Allied policy-making body \nfor Japan. The Commission ruled that no \nfood imports should be sent to Japan which \nwould give the Japanese preferential treat\xad\nment over the peoples of Allied powers, such \nas the Chinese and Filipinos, who were hun\xad\ngry and suffering as the result of Japan’s \naggressions. Substantial quantities of food \nwere, however, sent to Japan from the United \nStates beginning in April, 1946, much to the \nsurprise of the Japanese people, who had \nnot expected such generosity from their erst\xad\nwhile enemy.\nThe Japanese still recall with gratitude this\n284\n', 'Japan’s Role in South Asia •  285\nhumanitarian assistance, but the food im\xad\nports, important as they may have been in \npreventing mass starvation, did not have \nas their purpose the rebuilding of the Japan\xad\nese economy. The economic disarmament \nof Japan and the payment of reparations \nwere to entail reduction or elimination of \nsuch branches of Japanese production as \niron, steel, chemicals, nonferrous metals, \naluminum, magnesium, synthetic rubber, syn\xad\nthetic oil, machine tools, radio and electrical \nequipment, automotive vehicles and merchant \nships. Furthermore, Japan’s economic insti\xad\ntutions were to be radically “democratized,”\ni.e., the unionization of labor would be fos\xad\ntered, the monopolistic family combines (zai- \nbatsu) would be broken up, ultranational- \nistic businessmen would be purged, and land \nwould be transferred from absentee land \nowners to the peasant tillers. Certain of the \nAllied Powers, especially Great Britain, were \nconcerned that Japan should not again be\xad\ncome a threat to their trade. These economic \nreforms were substantially accomplished in \n1946 and 1947. In addition, basic political \nand social reforms were brought about, par\xad\nticularly the adoption of an American-in\xad\nspired constitution together with sweeping \nchanges in the law codes to establish a demo\xad\ncratic political and social system.\nUnfortunately, the short-lived successive \ngovernments of Japan showed themselves \nincapable of coping adequately with the stag\xad\ngering problems of hunger, inflation and un\xad\nemployment. These problems may have \nbeen made more acute by the economic re\xad\nforms undertaken by the Occupation. Un\xad\ncertainty as to which plants would be seized \nfor reparations deterred industrial revival. \nThe new labor unions were making unrealis\xad\ntic demands in the light of the condition of \nindustry. Relief shipments and other aid to \nJapan were costing American taxpayers about \nhalf a million dollars a year. Furthermore, \nJapan’s recent political and social reforms \nwere imperiled by the state of the economy.\nBy 1948, the principal concern of the \nOccupation was Japan’s economic rehabilita\xad\ntion. As it became evident that the dis\xad\nmantling of Japanese industry for repara\xad\ntions would only prolong the need for Amer\xad\nican subsidies to Japan, the United States \nrapidly revised its attitude towards repara\xad\ntions. It had not wanted reparations for \nitself in the first place, and it appeared that \nreparations to other countries would have to \nbe paid indirectly by the American taxpayers. \nThe Far Eastern Commission was unable to \nagree on a formula for the distribution of \nreparations, but directed interim removals \nof Japanese industrial equipment to certain \nof the Allied countries. The report on the \nJapanese and Korean economies (“Draper \nreport” ), issued by a committee of business\xad\nmen which visited Japan in 1948, recom\xad\nmended the removal of equipment valued at \nless than one-ninth of the figure recommended \nin 1946 by the commission on reparations \nheaded by Edwin W. Pauley. The negative \nattitude of the United States towards repara\xad\ntions was reflected in the Japanese Peace \nTreaty in 1951. Although the treaty con\xad\nceded the obligation of Japan to pay repara\xad\ntions, it pointed out that her resources were \nnot sufficient to make complete reparation \nand at the same time maintain a viable econ\xad\nomy.\nREPARATION S POLICY\nThus the United States, which was the \nprincipal occupying power, contributed to the \nrecovery of Japan by opposing a harsh repa\xad\nrations policy which would have proved \nruinous to Japan and probably would have \nbeen detrimental to the long-term economic \nwell-being of the rest of Asia. In accord\xad\nance with the peace treaty terms, Japan nego\xad\ntiated agreements with those Allied Powers \ndesiring reparations. The reparations pro\xad\ngram, the beneficiaries of which are Burma, \nthe Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, was \ninaugurated in 1954, and served as a begin\xad\nning for Japan’s postwar foreign aid program.\nAt the same time that Japanese economic \nrehabilitation was being undertaken as an \nexpedient for lessening the burden to the \nAmerican taxpayer, there occurred a basic \nchange in American long-term policy for \nJapan and the Far East. The National Se\xad\ncurity Council in November, 1948, deter\xad\n', '286 CURRENT HISTORY, NOVEMBER, 1965\nmined that Japan was to be strengthened \neconomically and socially, so that after the \ntermination of the Occupation it would be \nstable and friendly to the United States. \nSCAP was to shift responsibilities as rapidly \nas possible to the Japanese, SCAP personnel \nwere to be reduced, a national police force \nwas to be organized, and the Japanese were \nto be allowed more latitude with respect to \nthe enforcement of the reform measures \ninitiated by the Occupation.1\nAmerican policy thus shifted from punish\xad\nment and reform to the rehabilitation and \nreconstruction of Japan. The cold war and \nthe deterioration of the anti-Communist posi\xad\ntion in China were the causes for this shift. \nDuring World War II, the United States had \nassumed that the defeat of Japan would re\xad\nsult in a strengthened China which would \ncooperate with the United States as an influ\xad\nence for peace and stability in Asia. China \nwas assigned a permanent seat in the United \nNations Security Council as a symbol of great \npower status. In 1948, however, the Civil \nWar in China and the failure of the Marshall \nmediation efforts there meant that China had \nfallen prey to anarchy and imminent Com\xad\nmunist takeover.\nThus, in 1949, the Japanese Occupation \nentered the period of the “reverse course” \n{gyaku kosu), in which many reforms were \neither halted or completely reversed. The \n“trust-busting” attack on the zaibatsu mo\xad\nnopolies was slowed down and checks were \nput on the Japanese labor movement, which \nhad partially fallen under Communist con\xad\ntrol. Purged businessmen were permitted \nto resume their activities. When General \nMatthew Ridgway replaced General Mac- \nArthur in 1951, Allied Headquarters went \nso far as to invite the Japanese government \nto propose changes in the reforms which had \nbeen sponsored by the Occupation.\nNevertheless, it seems possible that the con\xad\ntroversial reforms may have contributed to, \nas well as hampered, Japanese recovery.\n1 This decision was never published, but is sum\xad\nmarized in Frederick S. Dunn, Peace-Making and \nthe Settlement with Japan (Princeton: Princeton \nUniversity Press, 1963), p. 77.\nWhether the contributions outweighed the \nnegative aspects is difficult to say, especially \nsince the reforms were intended to accom\xad\nplish ideological and political objectives of \ngreat importance. For example, the land \nreform, which closed off capital accumula\xad\ntion by landlords, probably helped to stim\xad\nulate the increase in agricultural produc\xad\ntion—in recent years Japan has produced a \nsurplus of rice—and certainly helped to fore\xad\nstall the growth of discontent and radicalism \namong much of the peasantry. The land \nreform, which owed much to General Mac- \nArthur’s personal interest, has also served \nas a model to other Asian countries seeking \nto achieve political stability.\nAt the same time, the increase in real \nwages which the Japanese worker has en\xad\njoyed because of the existence of the postwar \nlabor unions has contributed to the creation \nof a mass domestic market for the products \nof Japanese industry, a market which had \nbeen relatively insignificant before the war.\nIn 1949, a mission to SCAP Headquarters \nheaded by Joseph M. Dodge, a New York \nbanker, proposed a sweeping deflationary \nprogram. Although ruinous to many small \nenterprises, this succeeded in halting com\xad\npletely the inflation, which had reduced the \nvalue of the yen from ¥15 to $1 (U.S.) in \n1945 to ¥360 to $1 (U.S.) in 1949. The \nKorean War (1950-1953) created a war \nboom as the Americans relied on the Japan\xad\nese for aircraft parts, repair facilities and \ntrucks. Since 1954, American aid to Japan \nunder the Mutual Security Act has amounted \nto about $600,000,000 annually, but is now \nbeing drastically reduced.\nThe military aid extended to Japan has \ncontributed substantially to Japan’s postwar \nprosperity, since the island nation’s economy \nhas not had to support a sizeable military \nestablishment. While the United States has \nspent more than ten per cent of its national \nincome (or more than 50 per cent of its na\xad\ntional budget) on its military establishment, \nin recent years Japan has spent less than 2 \nper cent of its national income (or less than \n10 per cent of its national budget) on arma\xad\nments.

Japan \nentered a state of high mass consumption in \nthe late 1950’s. In the past ten years, there \nhas been an average annual growth rate of \n9.6 per cent, and the gross national product \nhas expanded about 2.5 times. Labor produc\xad\ntivity per person has increased by 51 per cent \nin industry and by 30 per cent in agriculture. \nJapan’s gross national product is now the \nfifth largest in the world. She leads the world \nin shipbuilding and is third in the production \nof crude steel. The Japanese worker’s stan\xad\ndard of living has reached unprecedented \nheights, and is approaching that of France \nand West Germany. In February, 1964, 81.7 \nper cent of all farm families and 92.9 per cent \nof all city families owned television sets, a rate \nof ownership exceeded only by the United \nStates. Forty-seven per cent of farm families \nand 72.2 per cent of city families owned \nelectric washing machines.\nThe rise in the standard of living is the \nmore remarkable when one considers that the \npopulation of Japan grew from 73 million in \n1940 to over 98 million in 1964, and that all \nof Japan’s extensive foreign possessions and \ninvestments were lost as a result of World \nWar II. However, lest one overestimate the \nextent of the Japanese economic miracle, it \nshould also be remembered that the total \ngross national product of Japan ($69.5 bil\xad\nlion in 1964) is only about one-ninth of that \nof the United States ($628.7 billion in 1964). \nThe Japanese still have far fewer automo\xad\nbiles per person than do the French and Ger\xad\nmans.\nThe postwar recovery of Japanese enter\xad\nprise was, in its early stages, severely ham\xad\npered by a shortage of capital. The taxation\nand reform policies of the first few years c \nthe Occupation wiped out some sources c \ncapital. The capital levy, the cancellation c \nwar pensions, the cancellation of war in \ndemnities, the land reform, price controls, th \nbreakup of the zaibatsu, and the demand \nof the labor unions kept down profits whicl \nmight otherwise have been invested. Japa \nnese business therefore resorted to borrowin; \nmoney from banks to an unusual extent \nThis expedient was encouraged by the Occu \npation with the establishment of the Recon \nstruction Finance Bank, but this bank wa \nonly one of many which, with govemmen \nencouragement and support from the Ban! \nof Japan, channeled capital funds to Japa \nnese industry. Since the war, the annual rat< \nof savings and capital formation has averagec \nabout 25 per cent of the national product \nThe thrift of the Japanese people has playec \na prominent role in the economic miracle \nThe experience of Japan with rather unusua \ncredit devices in the postwar economic recon\xad\nstruction is, of course, being drawn upon a* \nJapan assumes a greater share in the eco\xad\nnomic development of South Asia.\nThe structure of the Japanese economy has \nchanged. Agriculture, so significant in the \nprewar period, in 1963 accounted for only \n9.2 per cent of the national income, and only \n28 per cent of the working population. There \nhas been, in industry, a very notable shift of \nemphasis from textiles and other light indus\xad\ntrial items to heavy industry, and this shift is \nreflected in Japan’s foreign trade. Japan, of \ncourse, continues to rely on foreign trade for \nessential raw materials, such as raw cotton \nand iron ore, and for food imports. Although \nthere has been a substantial revival of several \nof the principal prewar zaibatsu monopolies, \nthe share of the economy controlled by zai\xad\nbatsu is substantially smaller than it was in the \nprewar era, the zaibatsu own a smaller part \nof industry, the ownership and control of the \neconomy is more diffused, and there is more \ncompetition than before.\nG O V E R N M E N T "P L A N N IN G "\nThe importance of planning in Japanese \neconomic life should be emphasized. The\n', "Japanese economy, like the American and \nWest German, is primarily based on private \nenterprise. However, the Japanese govern\xad\nment has traditionally intervened to give spe\xad\ncial direction to economic development, as \nwhen it fostered industrialization in the late \nnineteenth century and the expansion of \nheavy industry and munitions manufacture \nin the 1930’s. In the postwar period, the gov\xad\nernment’s “plans” do not represent direct gov\xad\nernment regulation or compulsion, but are \nprimarily predictions of and goals for the na\xad\ntion’s future economic development. These \npredictions, however, are in some measure \nself-fulfilling, because they are used as a guide \nby governmental and private banks in mak\xad\ning industrial loans and are consulted by in\xad\ndustry in its planning.\nIn the past decade, the Japanese economic \nplans (unlike those in Communist countries) \nhave proved to be not sufficiently optimistic, \nand economic expansion has overtaken the \nplans at a notorious rate. For example, the \ngovernment’s Five Year Plan, drawn up in \n1957, was for the most part attained by 1959. \nThe Ikeda government in 1960 therefore \ndrafted its famous ten-year plan for “Dou\xad\nbling the National Income.” Put into effect \nthe following year, this plan was obsolete by \n1965, as the economy continued to expand \nmore rapidly than projected. The resultant \n“overheating” has been characterized by price \ninflation, a chronic labor shortage, overpro\xad\nduction of some items, excessive plant expan\xad\nsion and a depressed stockmarket. The \ncyclical factors which underly these phe\xad\nnomena are the subject of much debate \namong economists, businessmen and politi\xad\ncians; in the meantime the economy con\xad\ntinues to grow.\nIn 1955, Japan began payments of war \nreparations to Burma and in later years, to \nthe Philippines, Indonesia and South Viet\xad\nnam. The cost of reparations, to be paid in \nkind and services, was as follows:\nBurma\nPhilippines\nIndonesia\nVietnam\nTotal\n$ 200 million \n$ 550 million \n$ 223.8 million \n$ 39 million\n$1,012.8 million\nBy February, 1965, the $39 million owed \nVietnam had been paid. Most of this was \napplied to the construction of the Danim \nDam, northeast of Saigon. Other projects \nwere the construction of a paperboard manu\xad\nfacturing plant, a forging plant, and a ply\xad\nwood manufacturing plant, the salvage of \nsunken ships, and the surveying of irrigation \nprojects. In April, 1965, Japan completed \nthe payment of reparations to Burma. About \nhalf the reparations to Indonesia and two- \nthirds of the reparations to the Philippines \nremain to be paid.\nLaos and Cambodia renounced the right \nto reparations, and instead they have been re\xad\nceiving outright grants, totalling about $3 \nmillion and $4 million respectively.\nJA P A N 'S  A ID  PR O GR AM\nJapan began her aid program in earnest as \nan organized activity in 1958, by granting a \nyen loan equivalent to $50 million, to the \ngovernment of India. Subsequently she has \njoined the international consortiums which \nhave been making loans to India and Paki\xad\nstan. The Foreign Office, the Ministry of \nFinance, and the Ministry of International \nTrade and Industry (M ITI) organized divi\xad\nsions and sections to deal with “economic co\xad\noperation” activities. In 1960, a new agency, \nthe Overseas Economic Organization Fund, \nwas set up to coordinate and supplement the \nforeign cooperation activities of the Export- \nImport Bank of Japan.\nIn 1963, Japan joined the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development \n(O.E.C.D.), whose membership had hitherto \nbeen confined to Europe, the United States, \nand Canada. The member states of the De\xad\nvelopment and Aid Committee of the \nO.E.C.D. have been carrying out aid pro\xad\ngrams. In 1964, Japan rated fifth in the \nO.E.C.D. in the amount of foreign aid which \nshe had extended ($245.1 million) being ex\xad\nceeded by the United States, France, England \nand West Germany. The 1964 figure for \nJapan accounted for 0.45 per cent of the na\xad\ntional income and included $62.9 million in \nreparations, $5.8 million in technical assist\xad\nance, $127.1 million in long-term credits,\nJapan’s Role in South Asia •  289\n", '290 •  CURRENT HISTORY, NOVEMBER, 1965\nand $39.6 million in foreign investments.\nJapan’s habit of including reparations \nfigures in computing her foreign aid total \nhas understandably been subject to criticism, \non the ground that reparations are not aid \nin the positive sense, because they represent \nthe payment of an obligation. This issue is \nimportant, because over one-fourth of Ja\xad\npan’s foreign aid in 1964 represented repara\xad\ntions. In the years 1961-1964 Japanese aid \nto developing countries was distributed as \nfollows:\nAfrica\nAsia\nEurope\nLatin America \nNear and Middle East \nOceanea (Australia, \nNew Zealand)\nTotal\n$ 21.1 million\n$ 674.3 million \n$ 21.4 million \n$ 289.0 million \n$ 114.8 million\n$ 3.1 million\n$1123.7 million\nThe current extent of technical coopera\xad\ntion is roughly as follows. The Ministry of \nInternational Trade and Industry (M IT I) in \n1964 sent 8 survey missions to developing \ncountries (including 4 missions to Southeast \nAsia) to advise on economic development. \nTen missions have been projected for 1965. \nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent out 10 \nsimilar missions in 1964 (including 5 missions \nto Southeast Asia) and projects 10 in 1965. \nThese missions were concerned with investi\xad\ngating the proposed construction of a harbor \nat Pnom-Penh, Cambodia, a canal in Iraq, \nand an underseas cable for Pakistan. The \nmissions sent out by the two ministries went \non the request of the governments of the re\xad\nceiving countries. In addition, private par\xad\nties interested in foreign investment in under\xad\ndeveloped countries sent 17 missions abroad \n(9 of these to Southeast Asia) in 1964, and \n20 such missions are expected in 1965.\nIn 1964, also, 753 foreigners came to Japan \nfor technical training with government spon\xad\nsorship; 910 are expected in 1965. In 1964, \n428 additional foreign trainees were trained \nat centers in Tokyo, Yokohama, and Osaka. \nIn addition to the survey missions, technical \nexperts dispatched abroad by the Japanese \ngovernment numbered 91 in 1964 and will\nprobably number about 147 in 1965. As of \nJune, 1965, there were 17 technical training \ncenters operating abroad, and more are \nplanned. There are, in addition, the India \nSmall Industry Technological Center, the \nEast Pakistan Agricultural Technology Train\xad\ning Center, and a Virus Research Center in \nThailand. The data given here can little \nmore than suggest the number and variety of \nJapan’s projects in technical cooperation.\nThe Overseas Technical Cooperation \nAgency (O.T.C.A.) was established in 1962 \nunder the supervision of the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs and is primarily responsible \nfor coordinating technical cooperation pro\xad\ngrams of the Japanese government. Other \nministries, foreign governments, and the \nUnited Nations and other international or\xad\nganizations (including the Colombo Plan \nBureau and the Asian Productivity Associa\xad\ntion) communicate their views to the Minis\xad\ntry of Foreign Affairs. The training pro\xad\ngrams are carried out by O.T.C.A.’s Interna\xad\ntional Center at Tokyo, the O.T.C.A.’s Iba- \nraki International Agricultural Training \nCenter, the O.T.C.A.’s Nagoya International \nTraining Center and the O.T.C.A.’s Misaki \nFisheries Training Center. In addition, \npublic institutes, semi-governmental organiza\xad\ntions, and the factories, offices and institutes \nof private firms participate in technical train\xad\ning.\nThe peak year of Japan’s foreign aid was \n1961, when $365 million (0.97 per cent of \nJapan’s national income) was committed to \nthat purpose. Since then, aid has been de\xad\nclining so that in 1964 it amounted to $245 \nmillion (0.45 per cent of the national in\xad\ncome) .\nJ A P A N  A N D  K O R E A\nThe decline of foreign aid since 1961 evi\xad\ndently stems in part from the problem of \nJapan’s relations with her former possession, \nKorea. Korea is Japan’s closest neighbor \nand even before the Japanese annexation of \nKorea in 1910 economic relations between \nthe two countries had been particularly close, \nin part because of the complementarity of \ntheir economies, the one industrial, the other\n', 'Japan’s Role in South Asia •  291\ngricultural. Since achieving independence \nn 1945, Korea has claimed that very \nubstantial reparations are due her for the \nconomic and moral damage resulting from \napanese imperialism. Furthermore, the \nCoreans have been worried that the estab- \nishment of close economic and political links \n:ould result in a revival of Japanese domi- \nlance over the economic and political life \n>f their country. The South Korean govem- \nnent, in enforcing the “Rhee line,” has not \nillowed Japanese to fish in the high seas off \nhe Korean coast. The willingness of the \n[apanese government to permit the repatria- \nion of Koreans residing in Japan to Com- \nnunist North Korea has been taken as evi- \nlence of the indifference of the Japanese to \nhe welfare of the Korean people.\nThe Japanese-Korean antagonism has been \n>f particular concern to the United States, \n.vhich has assumed much of the responsibility \n:or the defense and economic reconstruction \n}f the two countries. The Japanese have \nregarded Korean demands for the “normali- \niation” of Japanese-Korean relations as ex- \n:essive. The Japanese have evidently felt \nthat if they greatly expanded foreign aid to \nDther countries before settling with Korea, \nthe demands of the Koreans would become \neven higher. The foreign aid program of \nJapan has, as a consequence, been held up \nuntil a satisfactory settlement with Korea \ncould be reached.\nIn the summer of 1965, after years of false \nstarts, emotional flare-ups and street demon\xad\nstrations, an overall agreement between Korea \nand Japan was finally achieved. As antici\xad\npated, the settlement was far from satisfactory \nto the political opposition in Korea, which \nboycotted the Assembly session that approved \nthe treaties involved. Strong measures had \nto be taken by the Korean government to \nquell the violent protest demonstrations by \nstudents. The political left in Japan also \nopposes the settlement, claiming it is pro\xad\nvocative towards North Korea and Com\xad\nmunist China, but the agreements will in all \nprobability be approved by the Japanese Diet.\nUnder the terms of the settlement, Japan \nwould provide some $800 million to Korea,\nincluding a $300 million grant, $200 million \nin government loans, and $300 million in \ncommercial and private loans. This capital \nand the technology accompanying it, it is \nhoped, will stimulate South Korea’s economic \ndevelopment by helping create new industries \nand expand and modernize existing indus\xad\ntries, such as fisheries. At the same time, \nKorea has the labor and market potential \nto justify Japanese investment in Korean and \njoint-venture projects.\nNow that the Korean question has been \nessentially resolved, Japan’s foreign aid pro\xad\ngram has taken on a new spurt. The Japan- \nnese have recently felt free to grant to \nTaiwan $150,000,000 in long-term credit and \ndeferred payment loans. Foreign Minister \nEtsusaburo Shiina told the Japanese Diet in \nJuly, 1965, that the Japanese government \nhoped to expand Japan’s financial and tech\xad\nnical cooperation with the developing na\xad\ntions, particularly in Southeast Asia, so that \none per cent of the national income would be \nearmarked for this purpose.\nA S IA N  D EVELOPM ENT B A N K\nThe proposed Asian Development Bank \nand the one billion dollar Southeast Asian \ndevelopment program suggested by United \nStates President Lyndon Johnson in April, \n1965, are of special importance in Japan’s \nplans for the future. These matters were \ndiscussed by the cabinet-level United States- \nJapan Joint Committee on Trade and Eco\xad\nnomic Affairs in Washington, D.C. in July. \nJapan has already pledged to subscribe $200 \nmillion of the $1,000 million total quota of \nthe Development Bank. The location of the \nheadquarters of the bank is becoming a sub\xad\nject of rivalry among Japan, the Philippines, \nThailand, Malaysia and Iran. Japan’s de\xad\nsire for the governorship of the bank is \nstrongly contested, especially by India, but it \nappears likely from some reports that Japan \nwould give up the governorship in order \nto gain support for establishing the head\xad\nquarters in Tokyo.\nThe Japanese government has been pre\xad\nparing to hold a cabinet-level conference of \nthe Southeast Asian countries, and has in\xad\n', '292 •  CURRENT HISTORY, NOVEMBER, 1965\nvited representatives from Burma, Cam\xad\nbodia, South Vietnam, Indonesia, Laos, the \nPhilippines, Malaysia and Thailand. It is \nespecially important that Burma and Cam\xad\nbodia agree to attend, since their presence \nwould ensure the “neutrality” of the con\xad\nference necessary to the participation of In\xad\ndonesia. In connection with President \nJohnson’s proposals for Southeast Asian de\xad\nvelopment, Japan has already begun nego\xad\ntiations with Laos to contribute $7 million \n(in a long-range “soft loan” or outright \ngrant) to the building of a dam on the Nam \nNgum River. The United States has already \nindicated its willingness to contribute 50 per \ncent of the cost of this project, which is being \npushed by the Commission for Coordination \nof Investigations of the Lower Mekong Basin, \nan organ of the Economic Commission for \nAsia and the Far East (ECAFE) of the \nUnited Nations. In addition, the Foreign \nMinistry is expected to seek an appropria\xad\ntion of about 500 million yen (approximately \n$1.4 million) as an initial outlay for the estab\xad\nlishment of a Mekong River Development \nCenter. Although Japan has set up a num\xad\nber of technical assistance centers in South\xad\neast Asia and elsewhere, this would be the \nfirst multination center. It would serve 80 \ntrainees, or 20 each from Laos, Cambodia, \nVietnam and Thailand. Courses would con\xad\ncern water resources utilization, geology, basic \nmechanics, road and dam building, and agri\xad\nculture. The center would be managed by \nthe ECAFE committee on the development \nof the Mekong River.\nThe Japanese prefer that insofar as possible \ntheir aid be in the form of capital goods, so \nthat long after the aid is granted the plants \nwill continue to produce. It is also Japa\xad\nnese policy to send technicians, whose ser\xad\nvices are included in the price of the plant, to \nsee to it that the plant is in effective operation.\nJapan’s foreign aid program is particularly \naimed at Southeast Asia. The most obvious \nreason for this is territorial propinquity. \nJapan is the only modem industrialized na\xad\ntion in Asia, and she is keenly aware of her \nhistorical and cultural connections with Asia \nand her past, present and potential commer\xad\ncial ties with Asia. All of Japan’s reparatior \npayments have been going to Southeast Asu \nand they have tended to soften somewha \nthe lingering resentment against the Japs \nnese invasion in World War II and to accus \ntom the people to economic cooperation wit \nJapan. The poverty of Southeast Asia is \nprincipal impediment to an enlargement c \nJapanese trade in the area, and some of th \naid projects are directly associated with th \nimprovement of the production of essentia \nraw materials which may be exchanged fo \nJapanese manufactures. Thus far, how \never, most of Japan’s raw materisils have beei \nimported from the developed countries, an< \nit will probably be difficult to open up nev \nraw materials sources on a large scale unles \nthey pay commercially. Some Japanese ai< \nhas been going to the Middle East, Asia ant \nLatin America, but Japanese resources ari \nlimited and it is desired not to fritter awa; \naid on a large number of inconsequential proj \nects.\nThe financial aid extended by Japan is tiec \nto purchases in Japan. This proviso is madi \nnecessary by Japan’s shortage of foreign ex\xad\nchange and her balance of payments dif\xad\nficulties. Aid is extended in terms of yen \nThe effect of yen payments has an inflationary \neffect on the Japanese economy without nec\xad\nessarily improving Japan’s exchange position \nThe provision that the funds loaned be spenl \nin Japan does not necessarily work a hardship \non the recipient, because, as a rule, Japa\xad\nnese goods are cheaper than the products \nof other advanced countries. Furthermore. \nJapanese firms bid against one another for \nthe orders stemming from aid programs.\nIt might seem to the foreign observer that \nforeign economic aid would provide an outlet \nfor Japanese-idealism. The Japanese men\xad\ntality tends towards pacifism and neutralism \nas a result of the disasters of World War II, \nincluding the atom-bombings of Hiroshima \nand Nagasaki. A policy by which Japan’s \nsecurity and other international aims may be \nachieved by peaceful methods rather than \nby military means would seem attractive not \nonly to Japan’s neighbors but also to the \nJapanese themselves. Unfortunately, how-\n', "Japan's Role in South Asia 293\n:ver, the neighbors still have lingering sus- \naicions of what the Japanese are up to, fear- \nng a possible revival of Nipponese imperial- \nsm and militarism. And in Japan, many \n>f Japan’s foreign economic policies, includ- \nng reparations, have been subject to intense \n:riticism because of their implications for \n:he cold war. By extending aid to South \nrather than North Vietnam, and South rather \n:han North Korea, the pro-American conser\xad\nvative governments in Tokyo have been \niccused of using the reparations and aid pro\xad\ngrams as means of carrying out United States \nmperialist schemes rather than aiding the \npeoples of Asia. It would seem, however, \nmpossible to give aid to anyone without \njncurring charges of favoritism from those \n.vho regard themselves more deserving or \nfrom those in the political opposition in Japan \n.vho advocate a different orientation in the \n;old war. To aid Communist countries \nwould, of course, run counter to Japan’s \npolicy of alliance with the United States, \njapan’s modest but rapidly growing trade \nwith Communist China is sufficiently risky \nas far as relations with the United States are \nconcerned without incurring further dis\xad\npleasure in Washington by more actively aid\xad\ning the Communist states with which the \nUnited States is, or has been, at war. The \nUnited States is far and away Japan’s best \ncustomer, and it would be folly to endanger \nsuch a profitable commercial relationship just \nto achieve a more “neutral” foreign economic \npolicy.\nThe administration of Japanese foreign aid \nis less centralized than that of American \nforeign aid. There appear to be several \nreasons for this. First, the philosophy and \npurposes of Japanese economic cooperation \nare less clearly defined. For example, the \nhighly charged emotional questions relating \nto economic cooperation with Korea mean \nthat the Koreans and Japanese tend to re\xad\ngard the cooperation differently: to Korea \nthe purpose is reparation for past injuries \nand injustices; to Japan, the aid is in the \nnature of a grant to the Koreans accompany\xad\ning the grant of independence. By decen\xad\ntralizing the administration of foreign aid\namong different ministries, it is possible, for \nexample, for the Foreign Ministry to disclaim \nresponsibility for a Finance Ministry policy \nwhich a foreign state finds objectionable. \nAn obvious advantage of aid arranged on \na multilateral basis, e.g., through a United \nNations agency or an international bank, is \nthat then Japan is less vulnerable to charges \nof favoring one recipient over another or of \nattempting to influence unduly the politics \nof the recipient.\nIt would seem that in the long run Japan, \nwhose economy is based upon the capitalistic \nprofit system, will make a greater contribu\xad\ntion to Asian development by the normal ex\xad\npansion of commerce in that area than by \npurely eleemosynary gestures, but it cannot \nbe denied that certain types of aid, especially \nin the development of capital resources, will \ncontribute to the growth of normal commerce.\nThe rapidly increasing Japanese trade with \nmainland China and the growing competition \nof mainland Chinese goods with Japanese \ngoods in Southeast Asia will no doubt have \nsignificant consequences. The socialist econ\xad\nomy of China and the large role of govern\xad\nments in the economic development of South\xad\neast Asia may necessitate the continuance of \nactive Japanese governmental participation \nin Japan’s economic relations with South\xad\neast Asia. Japan cannot ignore her tradi\xad\ntional Asian markets and sources of raw \nmaterials. The worrisome discrimination \nagainst Japanese goods in the industrialized \ncountries of the West and the rise of trading \nblocs such as the European Common Market \nnecessitate the further development of Ja\xad\npan’s economic relations with her neighbors \nin Asia.\nTheodore McNelly has taught at Washing\xad\nton University, in St. Louis, and in the over\xad\nseas programs of the University of Maryland \nin Europe and the Far East.
