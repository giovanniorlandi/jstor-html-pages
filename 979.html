The Indications are that the cru\nsade will have to be perpetual to keep\nthe liquor trafllc down and that It will\nnever be entirely broken up. So long\nas there is a demand for whiskey,\nthere will-always be some one who\nwill manage some way or other to sell\nIt, It has been sold to a more or less\nextent ever Blnce Salem sprung into\nexistence, but of course a crusade\nagainst it results In making it less\nflagrant.\nSoMRof the Democratic papers in\nWest Virginia think our Government\nought to be in the licat of the light in\nSouth America.

If the\nwar keeps up, it is a foregone conclu\nsion that we will be in it, and there is\nno sense in this premature worry of\nthe Democratic editors. It is not\namiss, however, for them to be taking\nan interest so as to have their courage\nworked up enough to Bght, should the\nopportunity be afforded them.\nThe people of Adamston have at\nlast aroused themselves to the fact\nthat there Is much lost in not having\na town government. This change of\nsentiment on the part of many has\ncome about within the short period of\ntwo years, bat there has been a won\nderful transformation In that place\nsince last the question was before the\npeople and voted down. It Is no longer\na sleepy village but Is an active, lively\ntown. The population has made roar\nvelous growth and property bas be\ncome much more valuable. Some\nsplendid homes have been built and\nan Industry or two bBR sprung up\ntbcre. The changed conditions ap\npear to demand municipal govern\nment. It looks as if the majority of\nthe citizens of the place favor incorpo\nration and the many advantages and\nsafe-guardd to be derived therefrom.\nDRY HALL\nMade by Deputy Sheriffs In a Raid\nat Salem.\nProprietors of Speakeasy Board\nTrain Officers Get Oft.\nA warrant for Gain & Allen\'s speak-1\neasy and gambling place at Salem was\nput in the bands of Deputy Sheriffs\nKred Fleming and J. M. Knox\nWednesday afternoon. They went\nout on S5 to execute It, but the pro\nprietors gut on the same train that\nthe officers got off and thus made their\nescape. The deputies proceeded to the\nplace and proposed to break in, but\nsomeone assured tbem that if they\nwould wait a little while they would\nbe given a key. They waited and the\nkey was forthcoming. They entered\nbut round the place deserted so far as\nhuman beings were concerned, but\nthere were spirits there. All signs\npointed to the information that sell\ning had been going on there. They\nsecured a lot of gambling parapherna\nlia and brought it here. Otherwise it\nwas a dry haul, and the officers re\nturned on No. 4 empty handed.\nAMPUTATION\nNecessary From the Effects of\nTyphoid Fever.\nNewton Emory, of Cascara, Dod\ndridge county, was put on No. 4 at\nSalem last night and taken to the\nMaryland Hospital In Baltimore for\ntreatment.

There are a great many\npowerful situations In the piece In\nact Krst, where a husband and wife\nseparate, tbe scene becomes one or\nheartfelt Interest and brings copious\ntears to the auditors. The situation\nin act two Is another strong scene In\nwhich little Myrtle, the blind child,\ndoes some very clever and earnest\nwork, and holds the audience with\nclosest attention. The play presents\na number of excellent climaxes wbicb\nenthrall all present. "The Village\nParson" will be given with complete\nstage settings, the scenery being\nbrought here by the management.\nThe company includes actors of rec\nognized ability.\n"Gypsy Jack," Jan. 23\nDespite the apparent sway or farce\ncomedy and "show girl" performances,\nthe old-fashioned ;melodrama still\nclaims its devoted adherents. That\nthis Is so, without 4 doubt, is practlr\noally proven by the unstinted success\nwhich has greeted Willis Granger dur\ning his present tour with "Gypsy\nJack." Not only Is Manager Edward\nC.

Haddock, an Independent Op\nI era tor, Said that He Favored Giv\nj Ing the Mine Workers Conces\nsions Under Certain Conditions.\nBe ran ton. Pa.. Dec 17.-cNotwith\nstanding the fact that the mine work\ners announced Monday- that they had\nclosed their case with the exception\nof calling one more witness, the en\ntire two sessions of the strike com\nmission yesterday were consumed !n\nhearing three witnesses for ths men.;\nThey were John C. Haddock, ka indi\nvidual operator;,Rev. Dr. Peter Rob\nerts. who is assisting the miners, and\nPresident Samuel Gompers, of the I\nAmerican Federation of Labor. The\nprincipal point In Mr. Haddock\'s testi\nmony was that ne favored giving the\nmine workers concessions under cer\ntain conditions. President Gompers\ntestified as an expert on the trade\nunion movement. He created a stir\nwhen he strongly Implied during hie\nexamination that the coal companies\nare responsible for bringing Immi\ngrants to the coal regions. When one\nof the lawyers for the coal companies\nasked him If he knew It from per\nsonal knowledge he said he could\nprove It If necessary.\nEvidence Must Be Limited.\nThe miners made another attemp\'.\nyesterday to have the commission ad\nmit as evidence a large mass of testi\nmony tending to show that the an\nthracite coal carrying roads charge\nextortionate and discriminating rates\non freight and that a monopoly exists\nin the anthracite mining industry\nwhich keeps the wages of the men at\nan unnaturally low level. The com\nmission again decided that the evl\ndence must be limited to the scope\nof the commission and that if it did\ntake up the claims made in the evi\ndence proposed to be submitted the\nJustlflableness of the mine workers\'\ndemands would still remain.\nChairman Gray said that the com\nmissioners were Impressed with the\nspectacle of the little girls who were\nbefore the commission Monday and\ntestified that they worked all night.\nHe said the people of the community\nand citizens of the commonwealth\nshould not let the Incident pass with\nout taking some steps to have the\nlegislature of Pennsylvania seriously\nconsider the enactment of a law that\nwill forbid the employment of chil\ndren at night. At the suggestion of\nthe commission the statement of the\nwages of the fathers of two of the\ngirls were presented. One earned\nmore than $1,000 last year and the\nother over $900.\nThe cross-examination continued\nuntil 4:30 o\'clock when the commis\nsion adjourned until this morning.\nSmuggling of Chinese.\nCleveland, Dec. 17.?Jerry Brown,\nlocal United States immigrant inspec\ntor, is Investigating the alleged smug\ngling of Chinese into the United\nStates, across Lake Erie and into this\ncity.

Foreign affairs particularly\nconsumed the entire time of the ses\nsion. The Venezuelan situation was\ndiscussed in ail its phases, but no\nconclusions were* reached different\nfrom that which has actuated the\npresident and his advisers through\nout the consideration of the troubles\nbetween Venezuela on the one side\nand Germany and England on the\nother.\nCuban Treaty.\nThe treaty with Cuba, which was\nnegotiated in Havana by Generalj\nBliss, and which* arrived In Washing- j\nton in General Bliss\' hands yester-1\nday, was presented to the cabinet and\nconsidered in detail. It is ready for\npresentation to congress and proba\nbly will be transmitted to the senate\nwithin 24 hours. It is regarded as\nhighly important that it should be\nratified promptly, as the present Vene\nzuelan situation emphasizes the neces\nsity for coaling stations in Cuba.\nWhile definite action upon the treaty\nby the senate, or by congress, if the\nnecessity arises to present it also to\nthe house of representatives, is\nscarcely to be expected before the\nholiday recess, the administration is\nhopeful of prompt consideration of it\nafter congress convenes.\nSenators Talk on Venezuela.\nThe Venezuelan question occupied\nthe attention of the senate In execu\ntive session yesterday for almost an\nhour. The question came up in\nformally almost immediately after the\nhouse was excluded. Senator Teller,\ndisclaiming all Intention of being crit\nical, and saying he merely desired in\nformation* asked Senator Cullom.\nchairman of the committee on foreigu\nrelations, for the information He pos\nsessed as to the Venezuelan affair.\nMr. Teller, in Inquiring, said that the\nsituation is such that senators felt\nthat the Monroe doctrine at any time\nmight become involved, if the compli\ncation should continue.\nSenator Cullom replied to the In\nquiry that he had no knowledge of\nrecent events not contained in ths\npublic prints. Senators Bacon, Hoar.\nLodge and Stewart all made remarks.\nIn none of the addresses was any\nthing harsh or critical said. The tone\nof all the speeches, whether by Re\npublicans or Democrats, was that the\nattitude of this nation should be one\nof watchfulness. Tnere was a gen\neral agreement that while the means\nadopted by Great Britain and Ger\nmany for the collection of their debts\nhad been quite strenuous, they thus\nfar had committed no infringement of\nthe Monroe doctrine, and, therefore,\nhad done nothing to which th^ United\nStates could take exception.\nSession of Senate.\nWashington.

It\nis also generally understood that a\nmeasure will be passed placing at the\ndisposal of Attorney General Knox\nan adequate sum of money to be used\nfor conducting prosecutions under the\nSherman anti-trust measure. Presi\ndent Roosevelt thinks that something\nshould be done before the adjourn\nment of this congress, and in the\nhouse there is a* disposition to pass\nsome trust-regulating legislation, but\nIn the senate the proposition is not\nreceived with favor. Many of the\nleading Republican members of that\nbranch do not think that any legisla\ntion is necessary and others believe\nthat it should not be taken up at e\nshort session. From the expresslont\nthat are beard from senators it !?\nevident that an anti-trust bill that\ngets through the house will have hard\nsledding In the senate, with the\nchances greatly against its passage\nBut it Is almost ccrtaln that some\nbill for the control of the big corpor\nations will be reported to the <house\nby the Judiciary committee. Repre\nsentative Charles E. Llttlefleld, chair\nI man of the sub committee to which\nhas been referred all of the antitrust\nbills Introduced in the Tiouse, said\nyesterday:\nDisposition to Hurry,\n"I do not know how soop we will\nfinish our work and be ready to re\nport to the judiciary committee, but\nthere is a disposition to hurry mat\nters as much as Is consistent We\nwill have several more hearings, but\nwill possibly be able to report before\nthe holiday recess. I cannot fore\ncast the nature of the bill that will\nbe presented, nor can I predict\nwhether it will pass the house. There\nis a great variety of opinion and wc\nwant to give pll who are interested r\nchance to advance their views."\nConsiderable significance was at\ntrlbuted to the dinner given by the\npresident Saturday evening, at whiclj\nhis guests were the secretary of the\nnavy, the postmaster general, Sena\ntors Mitchell, Dietrich, Clapp, C. D.\nClark, McComas, Penrose, Dillingham\nBurnham. Burton and A. Q. Poster\nand Representatives Jenkins, Over\nstreet. Parker. Llttlefleld. Curtis and\nDelegate Flynn. Among the repre\nsentatives were four members of the\ncommittee on judiciary, which has\ncharge of the anti-trust legislation\nand the Inference was that the presi\ndent would use the opportunity tc\nconfer with these gentlemen as tc\nthe bill that would be reported to the\nhouse and talk with the senators af\nto the chances of a bill getting through\nthe senate if it passed the house\nWhen asked about it yesterday. Mr\nLlttlefleld said:\nNo Exchange of Views.\n"There was nothing said about anti\ntrust legislation that could be termed\na conference. The matter was only\nreferred to casually during the even\ning, and there was no exchange of\nviews on the question."\nA number of senators were asked\nyesterday for tnelr opinions on the\nprobability of an anti-trust bill getting,\nthrough the senate at this session\nbut none of them would say that hr\nconsidered such action likely. Sena\ntor^Quay said that he had been busy\nwith other matters and had not talked\nwith members on the subject. Sena\ntor Cullom said that it was not usual\nto tajce up matters of great Import\nance at the frtiortv session, ss the ap\nproprlation bills consumed most oi\nthe time. In fact, those who are sup\nposed to know the lay of the land\nassert, positively that there is nc\nchance for action at this session be\nyond appropriating money for the at\ntorney "general "to carry/ out the law?\n"how on the statute books.\nAs a senator expressed Itl "The\nfirst thing-.that theRepublican mem*\nbers of congress have to agree-\'upon\nis that some action fs necessary.\nAlter that they must agree upon what\naction Is neocssary. As yet there are\nmany who are far from convinced\nthat anything at all should be done,\nand while they think thu? there la not\nmuch "probability of any bill of this\nnature being passed."\nLost Both His Legs.\nPtttsburg.

Twyman is the marf\nwho figtired In the shooting affray at\nFleming-ton on Sunday.\nTwyman was shot in a drunken\nbrawl by a colored man in self-defense.\nIt Is said that Twyman shot at the\nother party, but missed his mark, and\nwould have fired again had not the\nother colored man fired at him.\nTwyman was shot through the abdo\nmen and also received a bullet In his\neft arm. Be was takcu to the Miners\'\nHospital on Monday. Deceased has a\nwife living at Flemington.\nThe body was taken to B. 0.

D., delivered on Wednesday even\ning of last week at the Baptist cburch\nwas a very able and entertaining ef\nfort. Dr. Peters Is one of the strong\nand powerful churchmen of the state.\nHe never speaks In public without ut\ntering truths worthy of a large audi\nence. His opening statement favor\ning a lecture course for such a town as\nWeston to educate the people up from\nthe low class of opera bouse entertain\nments to which they are accustomed\nwas a little caustic,but not misapplied.\nHe handled the subject of Love,\nCourtship and Marriage most admira\nbly. The address was rich In good\nthoughts, with just enough spice to\ncause everybody to thoroughly relish\nit. He ought to have had a larger\ncrowd to hear him.?Weston Inde\npendent.\nHobo Sentenced\nAt the Mayor\'s office this morning,\nMichael Ryan, a professional hobo,\nwas up before Ills Honor on charge of\nloitering. Ryan complained of not be\ning able to secure work and Mayor\nOrile gave him a five days\' job working\nfor the city.\nOne of the city\'s regulars wss up for\ndrunkenness.

N. W. Irvine, the deposed rec\ntor of St John\'s church, of this place,\nagainst Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Elliot\nwas resumed yesterday afternoon,\nwith Bishop Talbot on the stand. The\nbishop acknowledged that he had\nwritten the letter to Mrs. Elliot. In\nwhich he characterized Dr. Irvine a*\nbeing a "slimy" fellow, and advising\nMrs. Elliot to have him convicted In\na* court of record so that he (the\nbishop) could unfrock him. The pre\nsentment to the court covering the\nevidence at the ecclesiastical court of\nInquiry was virtually as follows:\n"The language which he was shown\nto have used to women was much of\nIt unfit to be printed In a reputable\npaper," and that notwithstanding he\nwas a married man he freely used Im\nproper language and gestures, and !\nthat he scandalized religion, and waa i\nconvicted of holding moneya <5ue to\nthe church.\n?The bishop was the star trttnesg\nyesterday afteTnoon for the defense. |\nHis counsel was willing to have him |\ncross-examined ad libitum. . The al- j\nleged forged\'letter written in Mrs. El- I\nHot\'s name to th\'e bishop" was admit\nted as evidence. The letter purported\nto be a retraction of Mrs. -Elliot\'s de- j\nsire to have Dr. Irvine ousted from\nthe church. After strenuoijs sklrm\nIshlng the defense rested its case. Re\nbuttal for the plaintiff was lmmedi- i\nately taken up. but nothing of partlcu\nj lar importance was elicited.\nA motion by the defense will be\nmade today to nave the court Instruct\nthe Jury to- bring in a peremptory ver\ndiet for the defendant?.\nGranted Tunnel Franchise.\nNew York, Dec. 17.?After repeats\npostponements and a protracted de\nbate the board of aldermen yesterday,\nby a vote of 41 to 3fi, granted the\nPennsylvania railroad tunnel fran\nchise.\nDaily Puzzle\nTHE\nContracting Builder.
