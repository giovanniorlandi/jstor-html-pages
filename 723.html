Army of 500,000 Be\nRaised Immediately on\nUniversal Service Plan\nWASHINGTON, April 2 —President Wikon’n war men\naage to congress follows:\nGentlemen of the Congress:\nI have called the congress into extraordinary session be\ncause there are serious, very serious choices of policy to be\nmade and made immediately, which it was neither right nor\ncousvitutionally p*‘ n "m j,!| *W e that I should assume the responsi\nbility of making.\nOn the third of Fcbruarv last I officially laid before you the ex\ntraordinsrx announcement of the Imperial Herman government that on\nand after the Arm day of February It »a* Its purpose to put aakde all re\natralats of law nr of humanity and use its submarines-to sink every vee\ni«>l that sought to approach either the port** of Great Britain and Ireland\nor the western coasts of Europe or any of the ports controlled by the\nenemies of Germany slthin the Mediterranean.\nThat had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare\nearlier In the war, but since April of last year the Imperial German\ngovernment had somewhat restrained the commanders of Its undersea\ncraft In conformity with promise then given to ua that passenger boats\nshould not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other\nvessels which Its submarines might seek to destroy, when no resistance\nwas offered or escape attempted and care taken that their crews were\ngiven at least a fair ckance to save their lives in open boats.\nThe precautions taken were meager and haphasard enough, as was\nproved In distressing Instance after Instance In the progrese of the cruel\nand unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was observed The\nnew policy has swept every restriction aatde. Vessels of every kind,\nwhatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their destination, their\nerrand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and with\nout thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessel* of friendly\nneutrals along with those of belligerents. Even hospital ships and ships\ncarrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, tho\nthe latter provided with safe conduct thru the prescribed areas by the\nGerm a u government Itself and were distinguished by unmlatakeahle marks\nof Identity, have been aunk with the same reckless lack of compassion\nor of principle.\nI was for s little while unable to believe that such things would In\nfact be done, by any government that had hitherto subscribed to the\nhumane practices of civilized nations International law had Ita origin\nIn the attempt to *n up *ome law that would be respected and observed\nupon the seas, wh* r< >.• nation had right of dominion and where lay the\nfree highways of »I■ • >rld Bv painful stage after stage has that law\nbeen built up. with meagre enough results, indeed after ail was accom\nplished but always with a clear view, at least, of what the heart and con\nscience of mankind demanded This minimum of right the German gov\neminent has swept aside under the plea of necessity and because it had\ndo weapons which It could use at sea except those which It la Impossible to\nemploy aa It Is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples\nof humanity or of respert for the understandings that were supposed to\nunderlie the Intercourse of the war I am not thinking of the Joes of\nproperty Involved, immense and serious as that Is. but only of the\nwanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of non combatants, men.\nwomen and children, engaged In the pursuits which hare always, even In\nthe darkest periods of modern hlstorv been deemed Innocent and legiti\nmate Property can be paid for; the lives of Innocent people cannot be.\nTbs submarine war against commerce la a warfare against mankind. Amir\nloan ships have been sunk. American llvee taken; In waye that have stirred\nus very deeply to learn of. but the ships and people of ether neutral and\nfriendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed In the waters In the\nearns way. There hae been no discrimination. The challenge la to all\nmankind. Each nation must decide for itself hew It will meet it.\nThe choice we make for ourselves muat be made with a moderation\nof counsel and a tmiperateneva of Judgment befitting our character and\nour motives as a nation Wn muat put excited feeling away Our motive\nsrtli not be revenge or the victorious aaasrtlon of the physical might of\ntho Patton, hut only the \'lndication of right, of human right of which we\nars only a single champion\nWhen I addressed ike congress on the twentyetxUi of February last\nDETROIT TIMES\nI (bought that It would suffice to assert our neutral tights with arms; our\nright to uee the seas against unlawful interference, our tight to keep our\npeople safe against unlawful violence. But armed newtraltty, It new ap\npears ie trnpnpdSubmarines art in effect outlaws when used as\nthe German submarines have been used against merchant shipping, It is\nImpossible to defend ships against their attacks ee the law of nations haa\nassumed that m*rchantment would defend themselves against privateers\nor cruisers; visible craft giving chase upon the open sea. It is common\nprudence In such circumstances grim necessity Indeed—to endeavor to\ndestroy them before they have shewn their own Intention, They muat be\ndealt with upon sight. If dealt with at all. The German government dentes\nthe tight of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which\nIt haa prescribed, even In the defense of rights which no modem publicist\nhas ever before questioned their right to defend.\nTbe Intimation Is conveyed that the armed guards which we have\nplaced on our merchant shipa will be treated a*\' beyond tbe pale of law\nand subject to he dealt with as pirates would be. Armed neutrality Is\nIneffectual enough at best; In such circumstances and In the fare of such\npretentions It Is worse than Ineffectual; it Is only U> produce what It\nmeant to prevent; It Is practically certain to draw us Into tbe war without\neither the rights or the effectiveness of belligerent*. There is one choke\nwe cannot make; we are incapable of making We will not chooae the\npath of submission and suffer the moot sacred rights of our nation and our\npeople to be ignored or violated. The wrongs against which we new array\nsurselves are no common wrongs; thsy cut to the very roots of human\nIlfs.\nWith a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of\nthe step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which It involves,\nbut In unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I ad\nvisa that the congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German\ngovernment to be In fact nothing leas than war against the government and\npeople of the United States; that It formally accept the status of belligerent\nwhich haa thus been thrust upon It; and that It take immediate steps not\nonly to put the country in a mere thorough state of defense, but alee to\nexert all Its power and smpley all ita resources to bring the government\nof the German Impire to terms and end the war.\nW’hat this will involve is clear. * It will involve the utmost practicable\ncooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with\nGermany and. as Incident to that, the extension to those government* of\nthe moat liberal financial credits, in order that our resource* may eo far\naa possible be added to theirs. It will Involve the organisation and mobilisa\ntion of all the material resources of the country to aupply the materials of\nwar and serve the Incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and\nyet the meat economical and efficient way possible. It will involve the Im\nmediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly In sup\nplying it with the beat means of dealing with the enemy’s submarine*. It\nwill involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the United\nStates already provided for by law in caae of war at leaat 500.000 men, who\nshould, In my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability\nto aervloe and alao the authorisation of subsequent additional Increments\nof equal force ee soon aa they may be needed and can be handled In train\ning.\nIt would involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to the\ngovernment, sustained, I hop* as far as they can equitably be sustained,\nby the present generation, by wall conceived taxation.\nI hope they may bn sustained so far ax may be equitable by taxation\nberauae It seems to me that It would be most unwlae to base the credits\nwhich will how be necessary entirely on money borrowed It la our duty,\nI most respectfully urge, to protect our people so far as we may against\nthe very serious hardships and evil* which would be likely to arise out\nof the Inflation which would be produced by vast loans.\nIn carrying out tbe measure* by which these things are to be accom\nplished. we should keep constantly in mind the wisdom of interfering aa\nlittle aa possible in our preparation and in the equipment of our oarn mili\ntary forces with the duty--for It will be a very practical duty of aupply\nlng the nations already at war with Germany with the materials which\nthey can obtain only from us or by our assistance. They are In the field\nand we should help them in every way to be effective there\nf shall take the liberty of suggesting, through the asveral executive\ndepartments of the government, for the considers’ion of your committee*,\nmeasures for the accomplishment of the several objects I have mentioned.\nI hope that It win be your pleasure to deal with them as having been\nframed after very careful thought by the branch of the government upon\nwhich the responsibility of conducting the war and safeguarding the na\ntion will most directly fall.\nBOMB PLOTTERS\nFOOND GUILTY\nNEW YORK.

April I.\nBILL RRENNAN. who t» umpiring th* hilarious aerie* between th#\nTiger* and the Giant*. will work this season In tb# American aseoel*--\nI tlon. laud season he wai In the Three-Kye league Brennan wield* a\nwicked Indicator He should he in the big *how. But be lan\'t. Where\nby wifi one of the strangeat baeeball tale* on record. For several year*\nBrennan was a National league arbiter Hl* taut season waa 1913 On tha\nthirtieth day of August In that year the Giant* and Phlllle* clashed at Phila\ndel phis In the first three Innings the Giants scored six tallies Alexander\nwas pitching against Matheweon. and Alec for once waa wild. He actually\nwalked the first three man ba faced. After a while Alexander steadied down,\nand in the atxth Matty wobbled In that round the Quakers counted five runs.\nA home run by Byrna with one on In tha seventh put the Phillies one to the\ngood, and In the eighth they scored again. In the ninth Inning, with one out.\nUmpire Brennan raised his hand and stopped tha game. That one gesture\nmade a lot of baseball history\nManager Charley Doota had been chased from the contest In the\nblithesome sixth, and Mike Doolan was acting boa* Brennan ordered\nPool an to remove a lot of spectator*, who had passed over from the left\n•eld bleacher* to the center field roost He complained that the moving\nfmas disturbed hi* vision and that of tha batter*, making It difficult to\nwatch the pitched ball*. Neither club had complained, and Brennan was\nthe first to raiee the question Doolan objected that he bad no authority\n•standlng beyond the playing field Then Brennan appealed to the police.\nAfter a lengthy wrangle that Involved police, umpire* and managers.\nBrennan forfeited the game to New York. The Phlllle* were ahead, two\nwere out In the nlnith. and there were 20,000 fans In the stands. Philadel\nphia was right on the heels of New York, which waa leading the rare, and\nvery naturally the fan* were more than mildly Interested. It took a\nsmall army of police to get the players end Umpire Brennan to their quar\nters without e massacre.\nLynch Root* One\nTHIS waa only the start of the fun. Philadelphia appealed to Presi\ndent Lynch, of the National league. Prexy ruled that Brennan\nwas wrong and declared that the game should stand with Philadel\nphia winning, 9to 9 That stirred up McOraw. who reached for\nhis tomahawk and went on the war path. The directors of the league\nlistened to the moans and then went on record to the effect that while\nBrennan was a boob, their president likewise had bats roaming In his\nbelfry They decreed thet at the next opportunity, the game should be re\nsumed with the same players in th* lineup The ecore aas to be 3 and\nC, there waa to be one out in the ninth, and Murray should take his place\nat hat. where be was when the trouble started.\nThe game, which started at Philadelphia on August 30. was completed\nat New York on October 2. This is the longest game on record. Murray\ngrounded to Byrne. Chief Meyers singled, but Grant, who ran for the red\nakin. was forced at second by who hatted for Hnodgrass That\nended the game and the clubs went ahead with the double header sched\nuled for the afternoon.\nBrennan was not satisfied with the turn things had taken, and the\nhumiliating consequence* of Lynch\'s ruling did not tickle the vanity of the\npresident. There was bad blood all around. Ihirlng the winter Brennan\nleft the National league flat and burled to the Feds That Jump never ha*\nbeen forgiven. While the senior circuit sadly need* competent umpires, it\nrefuses to make room for Brennan, and the American, while It has em\nployed Fed Umpire MeCorrolrk. accedes to the Tenerlte ban on the other\noutlaw. Bo Hill atili is in the bushes, with no Immediate prospect of a\ndraft to the big show\nAnother Roost for Joe\nBRENNAN passed the Winter in New Orleans and left that city only a\nweek ago He spent quite a little time at the Cleveland camp and\nwas particularly Interested In the comeback of Joe Wood, who Is\nlikely to make a contender of the Indian* if he regain* his former\nwaul Baeeball men are divided upon the probability of Smoky Joe be\ncoming effective again. Brennan bats on the Wood team Said he on the\ntrain last night:\nWood will not only be an ace In the hole for Kohl. He will he four\nace* and the Joker If Kohl will use him a* Connie Mack did Chief\nBender In 1913 and *l4 and call on .him to finish games started by otb\n•ra and only occasionally at the beginning. Joe ought to be th# jrmrr\n’eat relief pitcher in the Amerl* an league this season I have watched\nhim this spring and he will have no trouble with his arm Joe’s\ntrouble was rheumatism. He has been cured of that and there is no\nreason why he should not prove one of the most valuable pitchers in\nthe American league. With his stuff and his wise head he will win\nmany games for tha Indians.\nWinning Pennants v\nRECENTLY Hughey Jennings and John McOraw fan tested on pen\nnant winning. Both expect to be in the race this year, both have\nfelt the thrill of running down and capturing the elusive mg. an 1\nboth have usually been very much present- both a* player* and\nmanager* In all available argument* regarding the poa-eeslon of the\ncherished streamer. After a few hours of chatter they agreed that pen\nnantwinning is getting to be more of a task each season. Here is Mc-\nC raw\'s contribution:\nin the old days a club had only one or two extra players, an out\nfielder might be on first base and a pitcher in the outfield when not\notherwise occupied But nowaday*, with the abundance of substi\ntute*. It is s wicked problem to win game* Pitcher* aren’t knocked\nout of the box any more. Let a man show sign* of distress and he is\npromptly yanked for another. It take* well nigh perfect pitching to\nget by in the major leagues these days. I a game when I\nw*« playing with the Baltimore Oriole* when the opposing club scored\nIt runs off our pitche.r in the first Inning We wsnted to take him\nout, but he balked, saying that he would settle down ail right. So we\nleft him in. and he did settle down. They didn’t score any more run*\nand we finally won the game, h to 13. But what chance would a\npitcher have now to settle down it 13 runs were scored off him in the\nfirst inning’\nIt Is simply on account of the keenees of competition and th#\nabundance of playing material, compared with the old days, that pen\nnant winning has become such s task as It is at present I doubt if\nthe players of the present day are any more skilled than they were\nwhen Hughey and I were Orioles, if there is any difference. 1 hon\nestly believe that I would prefer the oldtlmers. I don\'t think there is\nany pitcher at the present time who i* any better than Clarkaon.\nRuale or Cy Young, and you would have to argue s lot to convince\nme that there ar* any as good But. of course, in those dsys there\nwas but one big league and 16 cities did not try to have major league\nclube.\nOriole* tb, the World\nMeORAW waa only warming up when he got this far. It waa In\nevitable that he and Jennings and the gang around should com\npare the Orioles to modern clubs. Neither John nor Hughey con\nsiders profitable a day In which each has not convinced some\nhapleea dude that the Orioles were the greatest ball club that ever aunk\na filed spike Into the leg of a hostile athleta. For the moment. McOraw\nwas humble. He was willing to admit that Connie Mark’s Athletics in\ntheir prime might have whipped the Oriole* because of the superior pitch\nlag staff This was not running true to form and proves that John haa\nkeen memory of certain world series In which the Athletics and Giants\nfigured. Warbles McOraw:\nI have often speculated as to the outcome of an encounter between\nthe old Oriole* and A strong modern club No doubt lam prejudiced\nIn favor of the famous old team, but ray prejudice la founded upon\nfact I remember one year when our weakest batter led the league\nIn three base hits. (Hughey Jennings says "Amen”) What they\ncouldn\'t do In one way they made up In another In fact. If the old\nOrioles had possessed pitcher* as good as the Athletics, and had been\naMe to meet them. I don’t think there would have been any contest.\nThe Orioles would have drowned them In run*. As things were, I\nwouldn’t make any prediction. Our pitcher*, except Clarkaon for the\nyear that he was with u*. were always Ineffective. Tho we had a won\nderful club, nome way or another our pitcher* wouldn’t pan out. I\nremember we got Gleason after every other club thought he was\nthru, and he won something like 23 out of 26 games. But I know that\nthere were a lot of game* In which we had to get a doxen or 13 tallies\nto pull him thro.\nNo. with the pitcher* we had. I don’t believe that even the old\nOriole* could have beaten the Athletic* with Plank. Bender, Coomb*\nand Bush tn form We would have given them a royal battle and\nscored more runs again** them than any other club ever scored, but\nour weak pitching would have been a vulnerable point for Mark to\nattack\nOne baseball sage frowns on military training for hsaeftall player*\n"What* the use of military training Tor hail players’” queries he with\nwildeyed sarcasm.

Tex., April 2\nThere Is going to be a showdown to\nday between the Tigers and Giants,\nupon which will depend tha fata ot\nth* series that Is scheduled to last\nuntil Sunday.\nTy Cobb already has definitely\nwithdrawn from the series, despite\ntba fact that he haa been featured\nas the star attraction of the bam\nstorming tour. Manager Jennings\nhas not repeated his threat to cancel\nthe series, which was made Satur\nday night In Dallas, but be Is In\nnone too pleasant a humor over the\nway thing* havs gone The storm\ncenter of what promise* to be a\nrousing controversy is Umpire Bren\nnan, who haa exceptional ability, but\nwho has Indefensibly favored the\n(Hants In Important decisions That\nhe waa employed by McGraw for the\naerie* does not help his case.\nBrennan\'s first bad error was his\ndismissal of Cobb from the game\nSaturday, and th# retention of Her\ntog in the line-up. His second\ngrievous error was calling Fletcher\nsafe at the plate with the winning\nmen Sunday, when Spencer had the\nball waiting fully two steps ahead of\nthe runner This decision waa ab\nMolutely indefensible, and ba* fired\nthe wrath of the Tigers.\nThe clubs have been in a bad tem\nper ever since ihe series started\nThere was a lot of wicked abuse Frl\nday, and In the fourth Inning Ben\nnie Kauff spiked Hack Spencer In\nthe thigh\nCobb attempted to Induce the\nGiants to cut out the raw stuff Fri\nday night, making the appeal to\nHerzog, who appeared to be the\nringleader.

HITCHCOCK\nIt is not generally known that there ia\nan Emergency Peace Federation in the\nUnited States and that it haa since March\n19, had within ita organization an unof\nficial commission which has sought by all\nmeans in its power to avert war.\nAltho the notice was short David Starr\nJordan responded at once and came from\nCalifornia to act aa its chairman.\nIt believes that the great contribution\nthat this country can make to civilisation\nduring the present war ia the champion\nship of neutral rights, and an interna*\ntional organization to guarantee fu\nture peace—a policy in accordance with\nthe best American ideals and the prime\nachievements of American diplomacy, in\ncluding those of the administrations of\nWashington. Adams, Lincoln, Cleveland\nand W’ilson.\nIt believes that the true patriots of\nAmerica have on their hands the biggest\nfight that has ever been waged against\nmilitarism and high finance.\nThe Emergency Peace Federation ap\npeals to the west and middle west which\nproved last November that the country\ncould decade its policies without the vote\nand help of Wall street interests.\nThe follow ing letter has been drawn up\nby the commission and forwarded to the\nPresident:\n"To the President:\n"W’e earnestly press upon you that\nwhen congress convenes you lead and\nclarify public opinion, now not only con\nfused but intentionally misled and in con\nflicting directions.\n"We urge that you analyze the interna\ntional situation for the benefit both of\ncongress and of the public at large, ex\npressing the desire to keep alive interna\ntional law and to make effective protest\nagainst ruthlessness and lawlessness.\n"We l>eg you to set forth the signifi\ncance of the conflicting policies publicly\nurged upon congress, that in making de\ncision it may clear its purposes to itself\nand to the public.\n"For instance, if war should come,\nwhat of the follow ing questions—\n" Should the United States form an al\nliance, informal or formal, with the En\ntente Allies? Or enter the war without\nany understanding with them, or how\nshould it proceed?\n"Should this country enter the war to\nestablish the right of neutrals to defend\nby force of arms their commerce with\nbellige rents?\n"Should this country enter the war for\nthe purpose of underwriting foreign\nl>onds, as is now urged by officers of the\nFederal Reserve bank?\n"What, precisely and clearly, is the\npurpose of the war if it comes? And on\nwhat terms would we consent at any\ntime to a settlement?\n"We recall that last summer, when mil\nlions of your fellow citizens could see no\noutcome of the Mexican crisis except war\nwith Mexico—on the innocent and the\nguilty alike—you announced that that\nwas the long way and the wrong way\nto settle international issues, making\nmere might the basis of settlementa,\narousing hatreds and leading the citizens\nof the nation against which war ii de\nclared to feel it an imperative, patriotic\nduty to defend their fatherland.\nW’e believe that the same principles\nhold good in the present crisis, and we\nlook to you in earnest hope for their real\nization.\nDAVID STARR JORDAN,\nChairman.\nLaugh With Us\n“Hallo! Hallo! Is that laurel drove police\nstation” Well, you’d better send one of your\nmen round to the High rd at once. There\'s •\npoliceman strapped to a lamp\nhere." j * t “ _\nAway went a ‘“special" hot es, .^3\nfoot to the Hlfh-rd., but no W 4\nsign of any outrage on th# ftg 111\nforce was to be seen.\nHe returned and reported A pf Y 1 A\nminute later the telephone bell U *\nwent aagln.

I certainly saw him strap\nped to a lamp "\n“Wbefeabbuts?”\n“Oh. up and down the High rd.
