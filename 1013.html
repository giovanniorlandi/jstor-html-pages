D., June 13, 1906.\nN\nEditor Tribune: Referring to tlie\ninteresting letter of M. A. Hansen,\npublished in the Palladium of the\n12th inst. would say that a coroner be\xad\ning called to take notice of a sudden\ndeath, must hasten to the locality\n•with, as a rule, no previous knowledge\nof the case, often has to return with\nthe body for the purpose of a post\nmortem and cannot know what is\nnecessary to be done u^tll he arrives\nwhere the body lies.\nIn the case of C. F. Mork he had\nbeen dead at least thirty-six hours\nfrom hemorrhage, and being corpulent\nwas in such a condition of decomposi\xad\ntion that I deemed it best to have his\nbody buried as quickly as possible,\nand so ordered.\nIt is no part or a coroner\'s duties to\nbury the dead. I turned the remains\nover to the undertaker, Mr. Upright,\nand my duties were over. He looked\nabout for material for a coffin, being\n22 miles from Wilton, the nearest\nplace where. co&ns are kept, and\nselected the lumber. He employed\ntwo neighbors and set the!n to work\nand arranged, to have them finish the\nJob and attended to paying them. As\nfor a funeral, that was for the neigh\xad\nbors and friends to arrange, and I\nfeel certain that no place would suit\nthe old gentleman for a burial place\nbetter than his own \'farm which he\nloved so well and which is to go to\nhis own children. Furthermore, the\nestate must reimburse the county for\nall siuch. expense The. custom of the\ncomnllssioners has always been to\nfile a bill against the estate for all\nsuch expenses.\nAs for an inquest, that is left en\xad\ntirely to the Judgment of the coroner\nin charge, and the law makes it my\nduty to hold an inquest only where\nthere is seeming evidence of foul\nplay. I get $3 for viewing a body, and\nan inquest brings me from $8 upwards\naccording to the time it takes, so it\nis largely to my interest to holla all\nthe inquests possible. Oat of seven\ncases in which I was called in the\nmonth of May, I held no inquest^.\nAs for the $20 Mr. Hansen men\xad\ntions the bill went before the coiin ty\nboard and was allowed and paicj to\nMr. Upright, that being the regiilar\nprice paid by the county for many\nyears. Mr. Upright travelel 98 miles,\npaid his fare and the keep of the\nteam, driver and himself, put in a\nhard day\'s work and paid his assist\xad\nants $10.\nOur county commissioners in |their\ndealings with my accounts as justice\nor coroner have always been! very\nzealous for the county and allowed me\nJust what the law prescribes apd no\nmore, and examine every item and\nAy* Jlf A&V\n3 4\n5 J°*r\n:t\n1\n•&\nM\'\n,-M\n1 ,f\n\',r.\nhave the bills submitted to the state\'s\nattorney, who goes over the bills to\nascertain if they are correct, and if\nnot they are scaled down to suit his\nand the commissioners\' notion.\nSince I have been acting as coroner\nthe past three years I have allowed\nthe undertaker $20 for burial of each\ncounty charge, no more. Sometimes\nhe has had to travel from 20 to about\n100 miles and pay his own way and\ngot only $20. Where is the graft? I\ndon\'t see it.\nGEO. L.

G. Patterson and is used as a blind\npig—without the blindness. Through\nthe medium of the Palladium, Mr.\nPatterson\'s paper, he openly defies\nthe mayor to enforce the. ordinance\nand remove his building. After read\xad\ning the lovely stuff in the Palladium\nabout office holders obeying the letter\na.nd the spirit of the law, such a pro\xad\nceeding on the part of Mr. Patterson,\nalderman and president of the city\ncouncil, is another sample of the\ntitter disregard he has of law when it\nsuits his convenience, or pocket book,\nto break it. The fact that the build\xad\ning would probably not bring a rental\nof $80 a month in any other location\nis presumptive evidence of the rea\xad\nson why the fire ordinance is disre\xad\ngarded and the mayor defied. And\nyet Mr. Patterson approved and signed\n-the ordinance as mayor at the time\noit its passage.\nThe ordinance was passed in con\xad\nformity with the precautions of other\ncities for the protection of the busi\xad\nness portion of the city from fire and\nto keep down the insurance rates.\nWith the president of the city council\nconstantly violating the law what can\nbe expected from smaller fry? The\nPalladium says office holders should\nbe shining lights in the observance of\nthe law not only In the letter, but in\nthe spirit. That it is insincere, and\nthat its owner and director considers\noffice a private snap has been borne\nout a hundred times In the last few\nyears.\nHere is the ordinance, and the peo\xad\nple can-Judge, for. themselves whether\nIt has been violated in the past by\nthis man aid is bteing violated now.\nNo permit Jia9 ever been asked for\nor grant§fl Mr. Patterson to move any\nof the old frame buildings he has been\nmoving and removing ih the fire\nlimits, and had any other, ffian at\xad\ntempted any oit these proceedings\nnone would have be|n so quick as\nMr. Patterson to see that the screws\nwere promptly applied—unless he\nhappened to be one of his tools the\nPattersonian maxim ai^&renity being:\n"So long aS? you\'re \'right with me\' you\ncan break any d-^-d law you please!\nSection 1 of the ordinance pre\xad\nscribes the fire limits.\nSec. 2.

S\nBismarck, N. D., June 15, 1906.\nEditor Tribune:\nI jim sorry to intrude myself on the readers of your paper so fre\xad\nquently, but I can hardly refrain from answering the article in th«s\nPalladium of today signed Z. B. Lach.\nwill start in by saying that a husband and father of a lovely\nfamily that would sit idly by and let first his wife and later his two\ndaughters die with any disease, be it black measls or scarlet fever^\nwithout calling medical aidi\' although amply able to pay for same*\ncome into public print to condemn the coroner for falling to diagnose"\nthe case. When I called there on the 13th of May I found the wife\ndead and four children sick. I told the father to get a doctor at once\nHe said he would. Father Clemens had been there two days before\nher death and advised Parzychowsky to get a doctor. The*\n15th I was\ncalled again and found two children dead, I took Dr, Chambers along\nand he made a careful examination, taking fully an hour, and pro\xad\nnounced the case black measles in a very malignant form. I asked\nParzychowsky why he had not buried his wife\'s body, five days hav\nelapsed since she died, and her body was in an old shack by the house\nand the two children\'s bodies by her side. He answered that he\nwanted to wait and see if any more died so he could take all the bodies\nto Bismarck for burial. I forbade him doing so and ordered them\nburied immediately right there. Pr. Chambers fixed up the sick chil\xad\ndren as best he could and recommended great care in diet, the father\nremarking that they ate good of pork and potatoes. I took an under\xad\ntaker there to oversee the burial. He traveled sixty-five miles, paid\nhis own fare and got $10, Parzychowsky and his brother having made\nthe coffins for their deacl.\nNow about the second trip. On the 15th I only charged for fifty\nmiles, just what I traveled. Having gone to view another case on\nthe way, I divided the mileage.\nTHE PALLADIUM LIED\nITS STORY OF THE COURT HOUSE\nPAINTING CONTRACT A GROSS\nMISREPRESENTATION.\nThe following official statement is\npublished to show that the Palladium\'s\nstory of this painting contract is with\xad\nout truth. Thecommissioners let the\ncontract to the lowest and best bidder\n—as they have always done:\nDr. Ramstad went there, it is true, in company with Dr. Chamber^\n—after the third chil^ had died—-under the instructions of the Board of\nHealth, at the earnest solicitations of the neighbors, who were getting\nalarmed at such wholesale deaths, a third child having died on the\n20th. After another careful diagnosis the two physicians concluded\nthat scarlet fever had developed. In the. last two cases, it beinig eight\ndays after I had firsfr been there and five days after Dr. Chambers\'\nvisit, and it would not have been surprising If even smallpox had set\nin after such, flagrant neglect, first in not burying the dead fpr five\ndays, and not having regular medical aid and then the gall of the\ndeluded man to let some unprincipled ward leader entice him into\ngoing into print to aid him in a lost cause. Shame on such vile methods,\nto even invade the sanctity of the grave and dragging a sorrowing\nfather into such unholy methods. This man, Z. B. Lach, who signed\nthe Palladium letter, seems to be taking far more interest In getting\nsome white-winged villian elected to office that he ever did in assist\xad\ning his afflicted neighbor during his trouble. During my visits at the\nplace not a neighbor came near the place or to me to see if the poor\nfellow was in need of assistance.\nFurthermore, this man Lach says my conduct delayed the burial\nuntil the neighbors got alarmed, which I am compelled to brand as\nfalse, as I have proof that I ordered the wife burled at my first visit,\nand before the children had died, and at the second visit threatened\nhim with arrest if he did not bury all the bodies immediately, and\nstarted them at it before I left, six days before the neighbors claim\nto have employed Dr. Ramstad.\nWhat will not some men stoop to to get votes. If such men are\nthe choice of the people to take charge of public affairs, what assur\xad\nance have we of protection from a reign of piracy.\nIf I have wrongfully obtained a dollar from the county or an in\xad\ndividual I am willing to restore five fold..\nGEO.

The day was\nperfect for such an outing%nd had it\nnot been for the importation of beer\nby Candidate Patterson everything\nwould have passed off with the great\xad\nest pleasure. Attorney Mockler made\na pleasing, congratulatory speech, Pat\xad\nterson told everybody what a good\nfellow he was and how he would re\xad\nform all the abuses of the universe\nwhen he became commissioner and\ndirected the thirsty to the beer car.\nThere was an interesting horse race,\nbase ball game, foot races and other\ncontests which kept the crowd going.\nDancing began on the platform In the\ngrove early in the afternoon and kept\nup until early in the morning. The\nvast quantity of beer taken to the\nscene by the candidate for county\ncommissioner was the only unpleasant\nfeature of the occasion. Enough in\ndescreet persons partook of .Mr. Pat\xad\nterson\'s hospitality to drive many of\nthe old settlers from the picnic and\nas a vote getting proposition Mr. Pat\xad\nterson\'s beer proved a boomerang,, as\nit engendered the fights that took\nplace and caused the only unpleasant\nfeature of the occasion. A gentleman\nwho has been attending these old set\xad\ntlers\' gatherings since 1888 said that\nthis was the first time that he had\nseen any drunkenness at them and\nthat Patterson\'s little scheme to get\nall hands drunk and bring them down\nto his grade of ethics was unfavorably\ncommented on by a great many peo\xad\nple. It is a shame that a gathering of\nfarmers and their wives should be\nturned into a political jamboree by\nPatterson and the crowd of boosters\nhe took along from this city to back\nup his false statements as to the senti\xad\nment here for him.\nThe Old Settler\'s Picnic—The pic\xad\nnic of the old settler\'s of Burleigh\ncounty is being held at Brittin today.\nQuite a number of old timers and\ntheir wives of this city, had antici\xad\npated attending the picnic until they\nheard that a large quantity of beer\nand liquor was to be sent out by E.\nG. Patterson as a contribution to the\ngood time. iMr. Patterson stated last\nnight that he had gotten up the picnic\nand was running it as a campaign\nbooster, and the statement seems to\nbe borne out by the fact that two\nwagon loads of beer left town at an\nearly hour this morning in charge of\nyoung men who said they were taking\nit out for Mr. Patterson. There are a\ngreat many prohibitionists in~ the\nvicinity of "Brittin, who, according to\na farmer of that neighborhood who is\nin town today, upon hearing of the\narrangements have retried the land\nupon which the picnic is to be held\nand wil try and keep the liquor off\nit. It seems a plty that the old set\xad\ntlers and their families cannot enjoy\ntheir annual outing without having it\nruined by such debauching methods.\nBat of course, as in the case of the\n•Palladium, Patterson will claim he\nhas no interest in the deal, and is\ndeadly opposed, to such procedure.\nThese annual gatherings of the old\ntimers have been greatly enjoyed in\nthe past as they hare been jfree from\nmotive other than the reunion of old\nsettlers, the* recalling of early 4ay In\xad\ncidents and the enjoyment of harm\xad\nless amusements. They should not\nbe turned Into poUtical gatherings by\nany party or set crf men and it Is to\nbe regretted that in the present case\na somber of people have been kept\nway because it has been ^ienly an\xad\nnounced that an attempt be\nmade to make the picnic* medium\nfor the personal aggrandizement of a\nCandidate for office. It Is hoped la\nthe future\nno\nsuch element will be\nallowed to come in and" destroy the\nIntent of the gathering.—From\nflpeefal tale on crocjtery\n-S\nfor\nSatur\xad\nday, Juiie 16, \'Call *$4 see my im\xad\nported white goods, the prices will\nsurprise yon at itauwses,\n*n&\nFourth street\nI "1\nBALL GAME.\nGood Play Promised Between Mandan\nand Bismarck.\nr"\nA good game of ball is promised at\nthe ball park tomorrow afternoon be\xad\ntween Mandan and Bismarck.
