Adair, formerly of the, United States army, now Dawson repre, sentative of the White Pass & Yukon, railroad, arrived last evening from Dawson, en route to the east on a short business, trip. He was accompanied bv Capt Wm., Mathew, master of the river steamer Yu, koner, and T. G. Wilson, a Dawson trad, er. Thev left Dawson April 8 and made, ,the trip without great difficulty, though In, one place thev drove through a foot of, water for a half mile while on the river, north of the Dominion cutoff., They report the river open from White, Horse for six miles down, and boats are al, ready being use there. In other places,, notablv near Mlnto and Five Fingers, the, river Is open In spots., The warm weather Is fast changing the, condition of the Ice down* the river, and, two or three days suffice to mike big, changes. At Mackays, when the partv, passed, there was a great opening In the, river where only a few days before heavv, teams had been driven oyer the Ice., Men can yet get through light, but it Is, dangerous for horses. The party came out, with a horse and sled as far as White, Horse, and completed the journey to Ben, nett In Red Line teams., White & Adair\'s big merchandise expe, dition. which left Skagwav during the lat, ter part of the winter for Dawson, was, metis or 20 miles beyond Selkirk eight, days ago.

Thev are, bound for Forty-mile, where they have, claims, and will put in hydraulic machin, ery, which they have with them. They, will build a steamer, with which to go. It, is their intention to turn the course of the, Forty-mile river to work Its bed, The members of the partv are E. Peter, son, John Peterson, H. Backer, L. Price, ana M. Rasmussen. Some of them will, go to Bennett today and some will get, away for that pol.it later this week., The partv has eight tons of hydraulic, machinery hire fox use in operating t heir, claims jointly. They also have miterial, for a steamer which they will build right, away at Bennett for use in convevlng their, mxhinerv and supplies tu their claims., One of the partv yesterday said :, "We shall build a steamer forty feet, long, with ten foot beam and a draft of, fifteen inches. With this craft we expect, to descend the Yukon to the mouth of the, Fortv mile, and to ascend that stream, ninety miles, to our claims. It Is a ques, tion a* to our success In getting up the, Fortv-mlle. but we shall make every ef, fort to ascend bv steaming and with the, aid of \'lining\' and whatever other means, we may te able to employ., \'fOur claims are in the \'Kink\' of the, Forty.mlle river, and the farthermost uo, the stream of any for which an? prepara, tions of hvdraulic work have vet been, made. We have nine consecutive creek, claims, and in order to more easily work, them we are turning the river from Its old, canal bv digging a canal 80 feet long, 61, feet deep and 40 feet wide. We have been, at work on the canal eighteen months., "With the river turned, we shall have, 180 acres of the creek bed exposed and, available for hydraulic work., "If all works well, we should get In, and have everything In readiness for work, bv June 25.", ?, Bkagviy\'i Inak Waltoa., G.

The receipt was, given by the keeper of the Mlnto road, house to Olson for money he had paid, there for accommodations. It was for him, to turn in to the telegraph company In evi, dence of his expenses., A pair of bicycle tweezers and a pocket, knife sup(?ted to belong to Fred Clavson, have also been found at the time place., Thla news was heard near Mlnto bv, Lieut, A. S. Adair, Dawson agent of the, White Pass road, and former member of, the United States Army, who arrived from, the interior last night. The searching party, Is cutting the Ice near Mlnto so thev can, Jredge the river, and have borrowed pow, der from Lieut. Adair with which to blow, Ice from the river., \'\'The men working on the Clavson case, at Mlnto are cutting Ice on the river at the, point where the trail comes down from, O\'Brien\'s ter.t to the stream," says T. G., Wilson who arrived last evening with, Lieut. Adair., "Six men," he continues, "were there, cutting Ice when Lieut. Adair and myself, and Capt. Matthews passed several days, ago. The pi ice where they wtrt cutting, Is over an eddy, and thev hope to find the, bodies lodged In the bottom of the stream., They have already cut much of the Ice, out of the river, ind have secured powder, to blast out more of the Ice, They got the, powder from Lieut. Adair, who had some, aboard a scow which was blockaded last, fall near Hootchikoo and hts been there, ever since., "From what I understood, the men have, save the actual evidence that the men who, have so long been missing are reallv dead., "The snow having melted, I under*, stand, thev found a place In the woods, where the murder, according to evidence, of blood and articles found, that the men, had, was committed, and then traced from, there to the water\'s edge sled tracks that, went so far out on the Ice and then turned, back." f, Lieut.

Even if our, beet hopes are gratified, and we do ob, tain municipal light* and the appropri, ation aforesaid, how much of it will It, be possible to obtain for the while, schools ?, This is ? timely question that has, been raised by Dr. Searl, who has re, cently returned from n trip to the east, w tiers he found that the people gen, erally werv entirely ignorant of the, fact that if a man had sufficient courage, to start a business enterprise in Alaska, the government immediately put a tax, on that courage. They said they had, never heard of business enterprises, beiug taxed in anv other part of Uncle, Sam\'s domain and they denounced It as, an outrage., These well informed people lake the, proper view of it, and it wss singular, that there w?re not more Alaskans who, protested against the lax oo the ground, of its unconstitutionality. It seemed I, as though Alasks had been neglected, and ignored so long by congress that, she waa deltghed to recuive any recog, nition. even if it took the form of a kick, instead of a helping hand. The tax, was a recognition, at any rale, that we, were citizens of tho United States, ami, of course if taxes were put upon us we, should obtain a voice in the manage, ment of tile affairs of our territory, for, it has always been held that taxation, without representation is a gross in, justice. But we get no representation;, we get nothing but a continuance of, the same injustice., Dr. Sear] raises another question., Is congress returns som? of this unjust, tax to us, how is it to be expended, and, who is to recommend and have charge, of the details of such expenditure ?, Why Gove.mor Brady, of course. And, what does he represent in Alaska V, Why the Indians, and no other race. |, Therefore let no whita parent spec, ulate on obtaining much, it any, benefit, from the large appropriation proposed, for education in Alaska. The Indians, need more reindeer, and other things., Certain it ia that the Indian has done, nothing, even with the large sums, spent by the govornmeot in his educa, tion, to assist In developing the country,, to build It up to a point of progress, which showed business enterprises, upon which taxes could be levied; but, that the white mau should be taxed for, the education of the Indian is the nat, ural course of events under the Brady, influence, and will be but another mon, umental injustice ot which his misrep, resentations of Alaska are the direct, cause., I, BDTUIO PROTECTION., The hardware merchants did an un, usual!? I*r*v Hjsiness yesterday in, "locks, bolt* and bars" lo keep the, burglar* oat. firs\' while the commoo, e*: kind of door locks were thought to, be amply sufficient before the Kalem 1, aod Shoemake burglars came to town. 1, bat doce then tb? fashions hi door, trimmings hate entirely changed. Now, nothing short of Yale locks fills the de, sire f< r protection, and there Is also *, call for sash fasteners, and the demand, for small safes is also brisk. One party j, yesterday, whose accounts did oot run \', high enough for a Are proof *af\\ par, chased a good sized japanned cash box., and had two holes drilled through the I, bottom by which he could screw it se, curely to the floor., The demand for flreartns was also un, usually good yesterday, and there were, inquiries for spring gun* and burglar, traps of various designs. In short :, therv was a general demand for every I, kind of protection except that of the, government, which has been found bv \', experience u> be a protection that does, not protect unless you catch the marnn- 1, der red handed and are strong enough, to haul him off to jail. Marshal Tan, ner is looking wise enough to burst a, Rropp cannon and scar* all the rogucn, out of town, and Commissioner Schl, hredc fs hunting among his hiw booVs, for the mo?t direful punishment* that, are pern Itte^.

He is of the opinion, the crv coming from Haines Is merelv an, agitation ?o behalf of some of the peiple, there to have soldiers stationed at that, point, and that thev cannot prove sufficient, evidence to warrant the stationing of, troops there. The marshal says:, "I have had men at Haines, among the, natives and oth:rs, watching the Indians, and listening closely to them to hear what, thev have to sav, and not an authentlcat?, ed report has come of any Intentions or, declaration of intentions on the part of the, natives to make trouble over the Imprison, ment of the Indians Implicated in the mur, der of the Hortons. All the demonstra, tion at Haines Is a peaceable one among, the Indians, and th at made simply In their, Solvation Armv., "Even were the Indians Inclined to harm, whites who go out from Haines to the, mines or up the creeks, the stationing of, troops at Haines would do no good. The, fact soldiers are stationed at Skagway, would not keep an Indian, were he so in, clined. from shooting * man up the Skag, wav valley just back of this town., "So long as the marshal Is able tr cope, with the situation there is no necessltv to, call on the troops. There Is absolutely no, trouble at Haines and none threatened, and, should I call out the soldiers I would be, conveying U)e idea that the marshal could, not take care of the situation., "Ju?t as so?n as anyone will prove to, me that my Indian at Haines made a, threat to commit a depredation I shall, promptly arrest that Indian., "The Haines situation, although peact, able. Is being watched., "As to the letter written at Haines and, published in a Juneau paper that four pros, pectors known to Jerome, a Juneau squaw, man, as Cleve, Anderson, Jim and Sam,, had gone up the Chllkoot river list tall,, in the face of a warning from the Indians, to stav awav. and have not since been, seen, I do not believe It.
