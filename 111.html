LATAH COUNTY. IDAHO. FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 29 . 1916\nNUMBER 39\nConditions in The Potlatch\nRev. George Finke, former mem\nber of the Idaho legislature and a\nresident of the Potlatch country for\nmany years, is a visitor in the city\nfrom his home at Cameron. Mr.\nFinke stated the grain threshing is\npractically completed in the Pot\nlatch country and the farmers se\ncured good crops. He said about\n..one-third of the beans have been\nthreshed, about one-third of the\ncrop is in piles on the ground and\nthe remaining one-third is uncut.\nThe threshing of the beans has\nbeen stopped by the heavy rain\nMonday but threshing can be re\nsumed in a few days unless more\nrain is experienced. He said the\ncrop could stand considerable rain\nwithout damage but because of tne\nlateness of the season, the farmers\nare considerably worried over the\nthreatening weather. The crop is\nnow being contracted at five cents\nper pound, which means the grow\ners will receive handsome profits\nfrom their bean crops.\n"The growing of Alsike clover\nfor seed has been introduced with\nwonderful success," said Mr. Finke,\n"and it is quite probable a large\nacreage of this clover will be seeded\nnext season. Clover is regarded as\none of the best crops for restoring\nthe fertility to the soil and the\nclaim is made that grain will not\nsmut on land upon which clover has\nbeen grown.\n"Edward Pompe, a resident of\nthe Cameron section, seeded 40\nacres to Alsike clover last year and\nthis year he sold his crop of clover\nseed for $2,400 or an average of\n$60 per acre, Edward Gertje real\nized the same price per acre from\na 20-acre crop so it is evident the\nresults attained by Mr. Pompe are\npossible in other sections of the\nPotlatch country.\n"The growing of clover for seed\nrepresents much less labor and ex\nJohn Imthurn of Juliaetta grew\n12,000 pounds of string beans\nwhich he sold to the cannery this\nsummer. He intends to plant a\nmuch larger acreage next year as\nhe made good money on the crop\nthis» season. He brought in eight\ndifferent varieties of beans to the\nKendrick Fair.\nMrs. J. Lace of Arrow spent sev\neral days of this week in Kendrick.\npense in the matter of growing and ;\nharvesting and it is quite probable\nthis will become a very important \'\nindustry in the Potlatch country in ;\nfuture years.—Tribune. |\n. left for his old home\nm Hamilton, Missouri, Tuesday,\nMrs. Boyd s mother died there last\nThursday.

Ill health and\ntemporary insanity induced by hem\norrahges of the brain, it is thought\nwere responsible for the young\nman\'s act.\nThe body was still warm when\nfound at 9 o\'clock by A. J.

The\npatronage given the course last\nyear has made it possible to- offer a\nbigger and better course than ever !\nbefore. In fact it is believed that\nthe people of Kendrick and vicinity\nare offered this year a far better\ncourse for the money than can be\nhad in any town of the same size\nin this part of the country. The\ncourse will be furnished by the\nEllison-White Lyceum Bureau of\nBoise and is as follows:\n1. Kekuku\'s Hawaiian Quintet,\nOct. 24th.\n2. The Criterion Glee Club, Dec.\n5th.\n3. Lyndon-Gordon Co., Feb. 9th.\n4. School Entertainment, (Date\nundecided.)\n5. Dr. Robert Sutcliffe, Mar. 9th.\nThe opening number will be\ngiven bv Kekuku\'s Hawaiin Quin\ntet, an organization of singers and\nplayers which has scored a huge\nsuccess in all of the large cities.\nThe most beautiful and soothing\nmusic is brought to us from the\nIsland of the Pacific and to many\nthe instrumental and vocal music\nof the Hawaiins is by far the sweet\nest. Hawaiian music by these\nnative singers and players has been\na great success in America because\nit is different. The melodious\nstrains of the songs and the accom\npaniment on native instruments,\nwith the peculiar sliding of the fin\ngers on the strings, is plaintive and\nfascinating. The guitar solos by\nMr. Kekuku are most wonderful\nand Mr. July is said to possess the\nmost beautiful tenor voice in\nHawaii. Mr. Kekuku has appeared\nin the one hundred and twenty-five\nlargest cities of America. Over\none million people have heard him\nplay. It is not uncommon for Mr.\nKekuku to play five encore numbers\nfor each regular selection presented\nlow\nlast\nthe\nity\nther\nor\nme,\nin\nthe\none\nto\nthis\nthe\nHis audiences seem never to tire of\nthe beautiful music.\nThe Criterion Glee Club has made\nan enviable reputation upon the\nconcert platform. It is composed\nof four men, with beautiful solo\nvoices which blend perfectly. With\nthe aid of Mr. Grover\'s crayon\nsketches and cartoons, and Mr.\nWood\'s çharacter songs, they pre\nsent a program full of variety and\nunusually attractive. Mr. Wood\nis known as "The funny man."\nHis voice is one of a rare type,\nbasso profundo, permitting him to\nfinish one of his solos on a B flat be\nlar\nof\nin\nof\nhe\nall\nfelt an\ntened.\n! anywhere,\nlow low C. The following testi\nmonial is taken from The Leader,\nGreat Falls, Mont: "The Criterion\nMale Quartette made a most de\ncided impression on the large\ncrowds at the New Alcazor Theatre\nlast evening. Such a Quartette as\nthe Criterions has rarely been heard\nEach member has a\nvoice of wonderful depth and clar\nity and they blend with most beau\ntiful effect."\nThe Lyndon-Gordon Co. gives a\nprogram of music, readings and in\npersonations. The following testi\nmonial of their work needs no fur\nther comment: "Here were two\ngirls who looked like a thousand\nothers but they were alive. The\nvery air pulsed magnetism and I\n" enervating tingle as I lis\nThey sang of the sunny\nsouth-and the tingle of banjos\nround the darkies huts hummed to\nme, the melody of the cotton fields\nwasm my ear-unconsciously my\nPresbyterian feet beat time, my\nfingers ached for the bones and\ntambourine of my amateur minstrel\ndays. Miss Gordon ran the gamut\nin dialect impersonations-She was\'\nthe Melting Pot of the Nations in\none personality—and I apologized\nto myself for not having heard of\nthis astonishing artist before.\nEvery time I think of that perfor\nmance my ribs ache. With a prc\ngram at once novel, delightful, in\nteresting. diversified, I will stake\nthe reputation of the Lyceum Bu\nreau in sajing that these talented\nyoung women are destined to thrill\nothers just as they thrilled me."\nDr. Sutcliffe will deliver a popu\nlar lecture which never fails to\nplease. Before entering the Ly\nceum, Dr. Sutcliffe was in charge\nof one of the largest mission halls\nin London where he lectured to the\nlargest audiences assembling in the\ncity at that time. The following\ncomment is clipped from the Idaho\nFalls Register: "Dr. Sutcliffe has\nmade a deep impression on Idaho\nFalls with his lectures and every\nbody will look forward to a return\nvisit. We have been indeed for\ntunate in securing Dr. Sutcliffe to\nlecture for us and it is the opinion\nof everyone who has heard him that\nhe stands head and shoulders over\nall others in his line of work."\nThe fifth number in the course\nwill be an entertainment given by\nthe Kendrick schools. Season\ntickets are now on sale for the en\ntire series at $2.00 for adults and\n$1.00 for all pupils in the high\nschool and grades. This makes the\naverage price for the five numbers\nunusually low.

The farcical primary\nhas been held and now for the\nelection. The voters can console\nthemselves with the fact that the\nstate tickets are not what they\nought to be but they might be\nworse.\nIn the county we have a fine lot\nof men to chose from. Both tickets\nhave serious defects but he who\nvotes blindly in local affairs, he\nwho selects raen to transact the\nbusiness of the county because he is\na Republican or a Democrat, is not\nqualified to exercise the right of\nfranchise.\nThe goverment of the county is\npurely a business proposition and\nparty affiliation does not qualify or\ndisqualify a man for the perform\nance of any official duties that may\ndevolve upon him. Select wisely so\nthat Latah county can point with\npride to her official family. The\nmaterial is before you and upon\nyou rests a sacred duty when you\napproach the ballot box.\nThere is much depending upon\nour legislature in the coming\nsession. Some of the most serious\nquestions will demand answers and\nnone more insistent than "the short\nballot." Conditions cannot contin\nue as they are. The state needs a\nmore efficient service and the legis\nlature must see to it that it is\nforth coming. Send broadminded\nmen to the legislature and be sure\nto keep the pretty grafter at home.\nIt often happens that a legislator\'s\nvote has no market value but don\'t\ntake chances. It has too often\nturned the scale of important legis\nlation.\n* * *\nTHE STATE CENTRAL COMMIT\n* TEES\nLast week the above named com\nmittees met in Boise. The gather\nings were in no sense notable.\nThere were several parts of the pol\nitical machinery that were badly\ncreaking but aside from applying\noil here and there and wrecking\none machine little was done.\nThe Republicans found their cam\npaign lagging. There was no gin\nger issuing from the Secretary\'s\noffice. In fact Secretary Elmer,\none of the very best posted men in\nthe state, was politically discourag\ned. He felt that he was rolling a\nstone up hill. To relieve the fric\ntion here Elmer was appointed\npublicity manager for which he is\neminently qualified and another\nequally good man, W. C. Gregory,\nwas put into the Secretary\'s office.\nThe Committeemen went home feel\ning sad but confident.\nThe Democrats found that their\npolitical machine was beyond re\npair. New parts were needed.\nThe old machine had been running\nfor fourteen years and it was evi\ndent that the master wheel needed\nreplacing and this was done. Judge\nPence, the dictator of his party for\nyears, was at last repudiated and\nDr. W. R. Hamilton installed in his\nplace. The Pence-Elder machine\ncame out of the fray a total wreck.\nDr. Hamilton is a Weiser man a\nreputable gentleman. He will in\nspire confidence from the beginning\n—something the old machine failed\nto do. Whether this lack of con\nfidence in Pence and Elder was\njustified is debatable, but the fact\nexisted and a new deal made neces\nsary.\nOne of our "leading" (?) daily\npapers says editorially:\nWe are at peace, but it is a pre\ncarious peace, for all the basic prin\nciples of international law have\nbeen destroyed during the last few\nyears. We are like a man living in\na gorgeous palace the foundations\nof which have been partly washed\naway and undermined. The edifice\nmay collapse at any moment.\nWe urge our readers to hurry to\ntheir storm cellars for security.\nWe advise them to cease eating,\ndrinking and merrymaking—for\n"the edifice may collapse at any\nmoment." How sad it would be if\nthey should not heed this warning\nand thus be caught in the debris.\n* * *\nWAR IS—INEVITABLE\nThe Hughes Campaign shows no\nsigns of improvement. The vilifi\ncation of President Wilson is the\nchief factor. The Daily already re\nferred to has however, the follow\ning to offer:\nIf Hughes is elected violation of\nour rights will cease, for the world\nwill know that the American people\nhave spoken, that our rights must\nbe respected.\nThe election of Hughes will be a\nsterner warning to the nations of\nthe world than any of Wilson\'s\n"firm" notes have—it will be a\nwarning from the people of the\nUnited States that we stand ready\nto uphold at any cost the honor of\nour country.\nHere is the other picture:\nIf Wilson is re-elected the nations\nof Europe will continue to violate\nour rights with Impunity, and we\nshall go from crisis to crisis until\nwe are inevitably plunged, unpre\npared, into war.\nIt seems to be war in either case.\nBut it is a notable fact that if Wil\nson had not been at the helm guid\ning the ship of state, this nation\nwould long ago have been plunged\ninto war as defined by Sherman and\nthis, too, wholly "unprepared."\n"He kept us out of war."

That Is the rea\nson the Iowa experiment station recent\nly published a bulletin on cornstalks\nand corn root disease. The station dis\ncovered a new disease which Is char\nacterized by falling of corn where the\nstalks were broken close to the joints.\nSuch plants contained only small ears j\nor they were barren. When a farmer\'s\nattention was called to this condition I\nthe statement was usuully made that\nthe stalks were blown over by the\nwind or that the trouble wns caused by\nthe corn root louse or corn root worm.\nThe disease uttacks roots, stalks and\nthe ears. It has not been determined\nwhether all of these diseases are\ncaused by the same organism or not.\nIn many fields the corn was broken off\njust below or above the Joint. The\npith or soft material In the cornstalks\nwas destroyed and was brownish or in\nsome enses reddish in color. The fibers\nwere soft and easily broken off. The\nstation discovered three kinds of \\\nmolds attacking the kernels, husks and\ncobs.\nThe only rational treatment Is rota\ntion of corn. Corn should never follow\ncorn where this disease exists, since\nthe fungus remains where the com is\nplanted In the same field the next year.\nYoung plants will become Infected. It\nIs a wise plan to treat com with forma\nlin at the rate of one pint to forty-five\ngallons of water for fifteen minutes.\nThe Iowa station received numerous\ncomplaints last year In regard to a\ndisease In cattle which goes under the\nname of cornstalk disease, or forage\npoisoning. It was so severe that some\nveterinarians advised not to feed corn\nstalks.

Heavy clays which are\nrich in Insoluble forms of potash and\nsoils containing large quantities of\nhumus are benefited by the use of\nlime, the key that unlocks the fertility\nof the soil. Sour soils are neutralized\nby the action of lime. Where moss and\nsour grass grow the soil Is almost cer\ntain to be sour, requiring a liberal ap\nplication of lime.\nIt Is generally supposed that lime Is\nlime—that Is, that one lime is as good\nas another—which is not the case for\nfertilizing purposes. Lime from one\nsection might be cheaper at $4 a ton\nthan lime from another section at Ç3\na ton, considering the results that\nwould be produced.\nBefore purchasing lime In large\nquantities it is a good plan to obtain\nsamples, label each sample carefully\nand send them to the state agricultural\nexperiment station for analysis.\nNitrate of soda Is the most impor\ntant purely nitrogenous fertilizer: also\nsulphate of ammonia and dried blood\nfrom cattle, which is saved and dried\nat the abattoirs. Calcium cyanamlde\nhas recently been introduced and is the\nfirst successful attempt at gathering\nnitrogen directly from the atmosphere\nfor commercial use. Experiments in\ndicate it to be about equal In value to\nnitrate of soda, but slower In Its ac\ntion.\nMuriate of potash and sulphate of\npotash are the two most Important\npotash fertilizers. The potash In both\nforms Is soluble and immediately avail\nable as plant food. Wood ashes con\ntain soluble potash, and it Is in a good\nform of combination.\nThe most Important phosphate fer\ntilizers are the ground rock phosphates\nand the superphosphates made from\nthem.\nSAVE THE SQUASH VINES.\nBugs Should Be Trapped and Their\nEggs Destroyed.\nSave squash vines by trapping the\nadult squnsh bugs and by destroying\nthe eggs, advises George A. Dean, pro\nfessor of entomology In the Kansas\nState Agricultural college.\nThe eggs which are easily seen\nshould be picked off and destroyed,\npoints out Professor Dean. The adults\ncannot be killed by insecticides, but\nthe nymphs may be destroyed by\nspraying with kerosene emulsion. The\nadult bugs may readily be trapped by\nplacing small pieces of boards or sim\nilar shelter near the vines, under which\nthey may be gathered in the early\nmorning.\n"Clean up the squash vines in the\nfall and reduce the squash bug for the\ncoming year," Is the recommendation\nof Professor Dean. In the early sum\nmer the females deposit their eggs\nmostly on the underside of the leaves.\nThey are oval, about one-sixteenth of\nan inch long and laid in clusters.\nWhen newly laid they are pale yellow\nbrown, but later change to a darker\nshade, so the stage of their develop\nment may be told by their color. The\neggs hatch in from six to fifteen days,\ndepending upon the temperature.\nThe young nymphs are brilliantly\ncolored, the nntennae and legs being\nbright crimson, the head and anterior\nthorax a lighter crimson and the pos\nterior thorax and abdonjeu a bright\ngreen. Soon, however, the crimson\nchanges to a Jet black. The young\nbugs suck the Juice from the foliage\nand soon cause the leaves to wither.\nCheap Shelter For Stock.\nA cheap shelter for stock is made by\nsetting posts eight feet apart, eight\nfeet high on one side and six feet on\nthe other, making the shed twelve feet\nwide and forty feet long. The roof\nruns one way, and the north side and\nends are boxed, with a gat« at each\nend and a rack running the full length\nof the shed on the south side. A shed\nof this size will shelter twenty-five ii\nthirty two-year-old steers.\nCover the Watering Trough.\nIf a watering trough is worth any\nthing it Is worth a cover. If you were\na horse or cow would you like to\ndrink out of a trough where every kind\nof a creature could wash its feet aud\nbefoul the-.waterï— Farm Journal.\ntt also tielps It to mature\'earlier in the\nfall. Whatever will add to the vigor\nof the plant while It is young will tend\nto increase the earliness of the ma\nturity. and a difference of a week or\nten days added to the date of the first\nkilling frost will amount to a great\ndeal In regard to the perfection of the\ncorn crop."\nTomato Worm Control.\nThe proper method of tomato worm\ncontrol In small patches is hand pick\ning and In larger gardens or fields use\nof a lead arsenate spray or paris green,\naccording to George A. Dean, professor\nof entomology In the Kansas State Ag\nricultural college.\n"When spraying with arsenate of\nlead use two and one-half pounds of\ndry material to fifty gallons of water,"\nadvises Professor Dean. One pound of\nfresh stone lime should be used with\nevery pound of purls green to prevent\nburning of the foliage. The paris green\nspray should be used with care.\ns£_:\n•SE\nS.\nrnTTu\ny/i\nThe above pictured buffet\nin golden or fumed finish, is\none of the biggest values ever\noffered The colonial lines\nof this piece sure makes it a\nwinner Price $16.00\nAT\nThis table is also a big sel\nler, and certainly is a fine\nlooking piece, furnished either\nin round or square column,\nfumed or golden finish, Price\n9 foot extention $16.00\nKendrick Furniture\nCompany.\nColic, Chofcr\nRemedy\nand Diarrhoea\nThis is a medicine that every\nfamily should be provided with.\nColic and diarrhoea often come on\nsuddenly and it is of the greatest\nimportance that they be treated\npromptly.

This sums up the ex\nperience of J. J. Budlong, a Chicago\nman who has grown wealthy in agri\nculture. Mr. Budlong for many years\nhas farmed several hundred acres of\nland and produces vegetables almost\nexclusively. The Budlong truck farm\nIs the greatest of Its kind In the mid\ndle west and In some respects the\ngreatest In the world. A pickle factory\nowned by this successful farmer han\ndles a large iiart of the edibles ruised\non the premises. Table commodities\nare shipped by Mr. Budlong to every\npart of America and to several of the\nbig markets in other continents.\nPractically all the onions and cu\ncumbers raised on this place are put\nup as pickles, and by this means they\ndo not have to be marketed in any hur\nry or at nny particular time. There\nare many other commodities which\nwork Into the scheme of canning and\npickling. For Instance, the cabbage\ncrop pays well when turned into sau\nerkraut, and benns and peas pay best\nwhen canned. It is always best to\nproduce a variety of staple products,\nso that if one or two of them are low\nIn price the others nre quite likely to\npull up the average to a profitable\nbasis. Tills Is a common experience hi\nall kinds of farming. Sometimes wheat\n' 4 - - -\nm\n§m\n' . ü ■\n£ «\nijiM\nTHE CABBAGE CROP PAYS WEMj WHEN\nTURNED INTO SAUERKRAUT.\nor corn will pay enormously, but If\nraised as exclusive money crops there\nwill be years of total failure. Thou\nsands of industrious farmers have been\nruined by sticking to the single crop\nidea on farms too large for their equip\nment and capital.\nCanning, preserving and pickling en\nable any farm family to double the\nprice which it would otherwise obtain\nfor such things as sweet corn, peas,\ncucumbers, onions, peppers, berries,\ncurrants, plums, cherries and a dozen\nsimilar commodities. This plan en\nables one to charge full retail prices\nand so make the farm return high\nprofits.\nNearly all farmers know how to pro\nduce crops, hut few of them are skill\nful ut selling. Tills is the main dif\nference between the Budlong success\nand the many failures which have been\nrecorded. Mr. Budlong himself says\nthat, ns a general thing, he does not\nget better crops than other people. The\nland he uses is not ns good as the av\nerage Cook county soil, but he buys\nmany carloads of manure from the\ncity and keeps the ground In n fine\nstate of fertility. The fertilizer is\nplowed In every fall. Sometimes he\nhas green crops, like peas, soy beans\nor clover, to work Into the soil in the\nfall. There Is n scientific reason for\nhandling land In this way, especially\nthe plowing in of an abundance of sta\nble and green manures, hut without\npretense of scientific attainments near\nly all farmers know how to keep up\nland, although they frequently neglect\nfall plowing.\nWhile it is true that Mr. Budlong Ir\nrigates his farm by pumping water\nfrom the drainage canal, he does not\nattribute his success to this control of\nthe water supply, for he was success\nful long before the drainage canal was\nbuilt. In brief terms, his first step\ntoward success was the upbuilding\nof soil fertility, and then when the big\ncrops came he made his own market\nfor the bulk of the products, getting\nall cash that was possible to obtain\nfrom the commodities raised. He keeps\nclose records of all crops and knows\nexactly what any given line of produce\ncosts him. He can tell what propor\ntion of the expense each acre should\nbear, what the labor is worth and what\ndividends are paid by each particular\nunit of land every season. From long\nexperience he knows that diversity of\nproduction is better than to risk every\nthing on a single crop. It is probably\ntrue that if the whole enterprise hung\non one product his success would be\nmuch less pronounced than it is.\nThe Ear Row Test.\nIt is well to mark off the ground of\nthe ear row test with stakes and to\nomit a row of corn around the ear row\ntests between it and the general field.\nThe'ear row test plot can thus he cul\ntivated just like the general field and\nat the same time without extra atten\ntion in that regard. The chief amount\nof extra work will be caused by the\nnecessity of harvesting the separate\nrows of :he ear row test separately»", '( DOCTORS HAVE THE KNACK OF PETTING WISE/}\nDO YOU MEAN TO SAY\nDOCTOR THAT A CHEW OF\nTHAT Size IS TOO MUCH?\nYCS.

B0WSFIELD\nI\nOne of the many farming dilemmas\nIs the need of improvemenU In silage.\nCorn was poor last season ahd was an\nunsatisfactory ration, whether fed as\ngrain or silage. Farmers were compel\nled to buy unusual quantities of con\ncentrates.\nEvery year corn will be bad In\nsome localities, and the problem of\nproper feeding Is pressed borne on\nmilk producers who ueed to maintain\na steady output and on farmers who\nare finishing beef. In both of these\nlines correct feeding Is of vital Impor\ntance.\nCowpeas and soy beans will splye\nthis difficult problem In most cases\nwhere they are used. The ordinary\nfarm should be supplied with these\nproducts so that the silage may be\nmixed. This Is an Improvement even\nwhen the grain Is first class. No field\nproducts are more valuable than cow\nities\nthe\nstill\nthe\nthis\nThe\nto\nthe\nIn\nof\nof\nN.\nBOY BEANS FOR SILAGE.\npeas and soy beans to be used In the\nmanner Indicated. They have the right\nDutrltlve qualities to give a satisfac\ntory ration when mixed with corn.\nThey are great as soil builders and fine\nforage and hay crops.\nA small farm having these crops,\ntogether with alfalfa or clover, can\nwork wonders In beef raising or milk\nand butter production. A crop of cow\npeas will put In the soil as much ni\ntrogen and humus In ninety days as\nclover will In fifteen to eighteen\nmonths and at the same time give a\ngood yield of the very best hay. They\nare most In favor In sections where\nclover catches nre uncertain, being\nhardier than the latter legume.\nThere are quite a number of ways of\nseeding, and every grower has his own\nparticular mode of sowing. Generally\na fairly good success Is obtained.\nAmong tbe different plans are broad\ncasting, sowing with a wheat drill,\nsowing with all the flues open, drilling\nby stopping up every other flue, drill\ning with a check rower and leaving the\nrows about forty-four Inches apart and\ncultivating them two or three times.\nTo make cowpeas do their best on In\nferior soli It Is well to use 200 pounds\nof commercial fertilizer per acre.\nFarmers complain about not being\nuble to cure cowpeas without losing the\nleaves, which are a valuable part of\nthe feed. If they will rake and shock\nimmediately after tbe machine and let\nthem cure In the shock they will reme\ndy that difficulty. Use a common mow\ner, and have a man with a pitchfork\nfollow the machine, turn the cut row\nupside down and out of the way of the\nteam for the next round. A small\nI brasher Is made specially for cow\npens nt a cost of about $75.\nSoy beans ought to be grown exten\nsively, whether they are needed lu the\nsilage or not. They yield from fifteen\nto twenty-five bushels of seed per acre.\nThree pounds of soy been meal can be\nsubstituted for an equal amount of\nlinseed meal with satisfactory results\nlu feeding daily cows. The economy\nand Importance of tills will be seen at\na glance. Aa a fertilizer alone they\nare fully equal to cowpeas, being\nstrong nitrogen gatherers. A long tap\nroot thRt penetrates the soil to a depth\nof from twelve to eighteen Inches as\nsists the work of fertilization.\nAny of the common varieties of soy\nbeans may be planted ns early as corn,\nas they seem to he perfectly hardy.\nThey do best planted after cowpeas,\naa tbe latter inoculate the soil. For\nforage they should be cut just as they\nbegin to show yellow on the leaves.\nLet them He for about two days, then\nshock and allow them to cure In the\nshock. This makes a fine grade of\nhay. that Is greedily eaten by all farm\nstock. Whfh cut at this age there are\nbut few beans that have matured. If\ngrown for beans they should be allow\ned to get ripe, by which time most of\nthe leaves will have fallen off, and\nthey can be ent and shocked without\nmuch curing. They should be planted\non the thinnest land of the farm, es\npecially If desired for beans, as on this\nland they do not make such large\nshocks, but more pods. The thrashed\nbeans are rich feed for hogs. They\naro aa rich as ollmcal pound for pound.\nA moderate proportion of this product\nwill give the liest results as silage\nwhen required for cattle feeding. Both\nof these crops are highly lieneficlal to\npoor land.\nGROWING ALFALFA SEED.\nHoms Production Feasible Whan Mar\nket Price» Art Prohibitive.\nAttention has been called to possibil\nin home production of alfalfa seed\nmarket prices are prohibitive for\nplanting of large areas, says the\nOrange Judd Farmer. Western seed\nholds the reputation for seed of\ncommon or taproot varieties, and\nhas been augmented by failure for\neastern sections to get seed from\nthese varieties. It takes a drought to\nmake the plants set, and ordinary\nyears do not usually provide a long\nenough period which Is hot and dry.\nspreading root varieties, such as\nGrimm, however, can usually be made\nproduce seed under eastern condi\ntions, and the possibilities in home pro\nduction, both for the farm and com\nmercially, hold much In promise.\nIn preparing the land for alfalfa seed\nproduction the soil Is handled In Just\nsame way as when hay Is to be pro\nduced. However, the seed Is planted\nrows about eight Inches apart and\ndropped by band or with a hand drill,\nseveral seeds only to the inch. At this\nrate It takes one and one-half to two\npounds for an acre, and with good luck\nacre may return five bushels of\nseed. The success of the seed crop Is,\ncourse, largely dependent upon the\nweather, and common varieties may\nbe expected to do well unless a\ngood drought stunts the plant growth\nenough to throw the plant energy into\nseed production.\nAn example of successful production\nalfalfa seed is found on the farm of\nLewis A. Morgan In Seneca county,\nY. In accordance with a campaign\nconducted by the Lehigh Valley rail\nroad In 1913 to encourage alfalfa pro\nduction Mr. Morgan planted one pound\nGrimm seed on an acre. The cut\nting gave him five bushels, which was\nenough for the land he wished to put\ninto alfalfa for hay, and also gave him\nan opportunity to sell a little of the\nseed at $30 a bushel.\nSOIL FOR ANALYSIS.\nSamples Sent to Experiment Station\nOften Do Not 8how Real Conditions.\nA very common mistake In sending\nsamples to the experiment station for\nanalysis is to select samples that do\nnot represent the true conditions, says\nBetter Farming. For example, a sam\nple might bo taken from soil near trees\nwhere cattle rest, and this material\nwould show far more nitrogen than\nthe rest of the field. The sample\nshould represent the average soil. Dig\nup the soil with a spade to a depth of\neight Inches and take a handful from\nthe top, middle and bottom of the\nspadeful and be careful to clean the\nspade thoroughly each time It Is used.\nTake at least a half dozen samples.\nPut these Into a pail or basket, thor\noughly mix them and send about a\npound of this mixture to the experi\nment station, where it will be ana\nlyzed. Samples should not be sent,\nhowever, without first having an en\ngagement to have the work done, as\nthe stations are able to do only a lim\nited amount of work of this kind.\nWhen one remembers that only about\nhalf an ounce of soil is finally analyzed\nit will be seen that thorough mixing is\nvery necessary. Do not mix different\nsoils. For example, if there Is an allu\nvial and nn upland soil do not send a\ncomplete sample of both, but gather\nthe composite samples separately.\nOld Boiler Standpipe.\nOld boilers can be found In most ev\nery Junk yard and can be obtained at\na very reasonable price. One farmer\nbought an old boiler of a nearby city\ncouncil, transported it to his farm and\nset It up on a concrete base. He uses\nit for a water supply tank, which gives\nUlm water under pressure In all de\npartments of the farm.\nHe took all tbe old tubes out of tbe\nold boiler and sold them for Junk,\nwhich paid him for hauling the ouflit\nto his farm. The old boiler was given a\ncoat of asphalt paint Inside and out.\nDuring the cold winter months this\nfarmer prevents the water from freez\ning by packing straw around It.—Farm\nProgress.\nLime Increases Wheat Yiald.\n"Neither manure nor any combina\ntion of fertilizers has been able to pro\nduce a full yield of wheat without the\nhelp of lime," said Director C. E.\nThome regarding tbe value of lime on\nsoil similar to that of the Ohio Experi\nment station at Wooster. This year\nmanured laud yielded 21 to 26 per cent\nmore wheat where Ume was applied.\nAnother plot fertilised with nitrate of\nsoda, acid phosphate and muriate of\npotash gave 2i per cent more wheat\nwhere limed than on unlimed soil sim\nilarly fertilized. The yield on a plot\nreceiving complete fertilizer with nitro\ngen in sulphate of ammonia gave 115\nper cent Increase In crop by applica\ntion of Ume.\nWinter Vetch end Rye.\nAn expert says that winter vetch\ndoes best as a cover crop If a little rye\nIs seeded with it One bnshel of vetch\nto one-half bushel of rye per acre Is\nabout right In mild climates crimson\nclover can be used Instead of vetch.\nDURING\nTHE FAIR\nSept 27, 28 ahd 29\nWe extend to you, a special\ninvitation to visit our store.\nWe will have new goods\nto show that will interest\nyou.\n$ Farmers Hardware\nX Company\nFor The School Children\nWe carry a full line of\nTablets, Pencils, Crayons, Draw\ning Paper, School Books _\nMore than pleased to order and obtain for you\nanything in the school book line.
