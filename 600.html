        <pre>['215\n“[T]he government opted for piecemeal solutions that would temporarily meet \ndomestic needs for labor while maintaining official closed-door policies.”\nJapan’s Model of Immigration \nWithout Immigrants\nERIN AERAN CHUNG\nOn November 27, 2018, the Diet, Japan’s \nparliament, passed an unprecedented bill \nto open the country’s borders to as many \nas 345,000 workers in the agriculture, construction,\nshipbuilding, hospitality, and nursing sec-\ntors over a five-year period. The measure, which \nwas introduced by the ruling Liberal Democratic \nParty (LDP) and took effect in April 2019, has \ngenerated considerable controversy. This is the \nfirst time in postwar Japan’s history that the \ncountry’s borders are officially open to unskilled \nforeign labor.\nAlthough Japan has used de facto guest-worker \npolicies to fill labor shortages since the 1980s, the \nstate has neither recognized migrants formally as \nworkers nor acknowledged the existence of any \nguest-worker program. In keeping with this history,\nthe administration of Prime Minister Shinzo \nAbe has made clear that it does not consider migrant\nworkers to be immigrants, and insists that \nthe new plan is not equivalent to a full-fledged immigration\npolicy.\nSome observers nonetheless have suggested \nthat the 2018 law represents a radical shift away \nfrom Japan’s restrictive immigration policies. \nHowever, the parameters of the guest-worker system\nare consistent with the incremental steps that \nJapan has taken over the years to satisfy demand \nfor labor with low-skilled migrant labor schemes. \nAlthough it has endured chronic labor shortages \nsince the 1980s and now faces an impending demographic\ncrisis, Japan was, until now, the only \nadvanced industrial democracy that had kept its \nborders officially closed to unskilled foreign labor \nsince the end of World War II.\nSince 2005, Japan has competed with a handful\nof other Asian countries—including Singapore, \nSouth Korea, and Taiwan—for the less than desirable\ndistinction of having the world’s fastest-aging \npopulation, lowest birthrate, and most rapidly \nshrinking workforce. In a 2001 report on replacement\nmigration, the United Nations Population \nDivision estimated that Japan would have to admit\napproximately 647,000 immigrants annually \nin order to alleviate labor shortages and the fiscal \nburdens imposed by its booming number of elderly\ncitizens.\nThe number of foreign nationals in Japan has \ngrown in recent years—from 850,000 in 1985 to \nover 2.7 million last year—but they still make up \nonly about 2 percent of the total population, despite\nthe record pace at which the population is \nshrinking. Japan’s ratio of foreigners to natives is \nsignificantly lower than the average range of 8 to \n25 percent in Western European countries.\nJapan experienced labor shortages at earlier \nstages of its industrial development, but it was \nable to meet demand by tapping domestic sources \nof underutilized labor, such as rural workers and \nwomen. By the 1980s, however, domestic sources \nof unskilled labor were largely depleted. Rather \nthan import foreign workers who might destabilize\nwhat politicians and pundits across the po-\nlitical spectrum described as Japan’s “uniquely \nhomogeneous society,” the government opted for \npiecemeal solutions that would temporarily meet \ndomestic needs for labor while maintaining official\nclosed-door policies.\nOPENING LOOPHOLES\nA revision of the Immigration Control and Refugee\nRecognition Act in 1990 opened up two legal \nloopholes for de facto guest-worker policies. One \nprovision created a skills-training program for \nERIN AERAN CHUNG is an associate professor of East Asian \npolitics and co-director of the Racism, Immigration, and Citizenship\nProgram at Johns Hopkins University.\n', '216 • CURRENT HISTORY • September 2019\n“trainees” and “interns” from other Asian countries.\nAnother established visa policies that offered \nunrestricted entry and employment rights in Japan \nfor ethnic Japanese immigrants seeking to return \nto their ancestral homeland from overseas, mostly \nin Brazil and Peru.\nThe industrial trainee program allows employers\nto recruit migrant laborers—usually from oth-\ner Asian countries such as China, South Korea, \nand Vietnam—who are not officially recognized \nas workers. The Immigration Control Act defines \n“trainees” as those who undertake activities to \nlearn and acquire technology, skills, or knowledge \nat public and private organizations in Japan. Under\nthis broad definition, people who entered Ja-\npan in the early 1990s with the one-year trainee \nvisa were eligible only for a “trainee allowance,” \nwhich was unregulated and usually well below the \nminimum wage—as low as 100 yen (less than one \ndollar) per hour, according to an April 2005 report \nin the Mainichi Shimbun. They were not protected \nby labor laws, making them vulnerable to industrial\naccidents, unpaid wages, \nand abusive employers.\nSeveral subsequent revisions\nsought to improve these \nconditions. They included \nextensions of trainee visas \nand government guidelines \nprohibiting employers from \nengaging in abusive practices. Landmark court \ndecisions in 1993 affirmed trainees’ rights to \nindustrial-accident compensation, back wages, \nand severance pay. But trainees continued to suffer\npoor working conditions. The program also \ncontributed to the growth of the undocumented \nmigrant population, as increasing numbers of \ntrainees overstayed their visas and some sought \nunauthorized employment in higher-paying jobs.\nIn response to reports of endemic abuse, the Japan\nInternational Training Cooperation Organiza-\ntion, the government body tasked with supervising\nthe trainee scheme, established the Technical \nIntern Training Program in 1993. It made trainees \neligible for a “designated activities” visa that allowed\nthem to extend their stay in Japan for up \nto three years, as long as they had an employment \ncontract.\nAmong the expanded visa categories created \nby the 1990 legislation is the long-term residency \n(teiju) visa specifically for ethnic Japanese immigrants\n(popularly called Nikkei) whose parents or \ngrandparents came from Japan. Its stated purpose \nis to encourage them to learn Japanese, explore \ntheir cultural heritage, and visit their relatives. \nThis became one of a handful of visa categories \nthat provided unrestricted entry and employment \nrights in Japan. The Nikkei visas were much more \ngenerous than those issued to industrial trainees, \nwhich did not allow workers to change employers,\nrestricted residence in Japan to a maximum \nof three years, and were contingent on continued \nemployment by the sponsoring company.  \nThe vast majority of teiju visa holders were recruited\nfrom Brazil and Peru to work for small- \nand medium-sized firms in the construction and \nmanufacturing sectors. Already in 1991, Brazilians \nwere the third-largest foreign national group in \nJapan, following Koreans and Chinese. By 2008, \nthe combined Brazilian and Peruvian population \nin Japan had grown more than fivefold since the \n1990 reform, to over 365,000.\nUNANTICIPATED COMPLICATIONS\nThese two legal loopholes were established to \naddress concerns that foreign \nworkers from Asian countries \nwould seek to settle permanently\nin Japan, just as Turk-\nish and Yugoslav guest workers\nhad done in Germany. To \nprevent that from happening, \nforeign workers would be \nsubject to close monitoring, short-term visas, and \nemployment restrictions. Proponents of the longterm\nresidency visa, meanwhile, maintained that \nNikkei migrant workers, who were at least partly \nJapanese by blood, would cause minimal disruption\nto social stability. And they would contribute \nto labor-starved industries, making it unnecessary \nto officially open Japan’s borders to foreign labor.\nBy the late 1990s, it became clear that most Nikkei\nimmigrants would not automatically assimilate \ninto Japanese society simply because they were \nco-ethnics. Studies conducted by the Ministry of \nJustice found that Nikkei exhibited low rates of \nJapanese language literacy and faced many of the \nsame problems as other non-Japanese foreigners. \nThe studies also concluded that the long-term \nsettlement of Nikkei immigrants could contribute \nto social instability, citing their reliance on social \nwelfare during periods of cyclical unemployment \nand their children’s low rate of school enrollment.\nDuring the global downturn following the 2008 \nfinancial crisis, companies in Japan’s automobile, \nmachinery, and information-technology indusJapan\nhas earned a reputation \nfor being a society that is \nhostile to immigrants.\n', 'tries, which employed many Nikkei, laid off large \nnumbers of contract workers. By the beginning \nof 2009, the unemployment rate among Brazilian \nand Peruvian workers in Japan (most of whom are \nethnic Japanese) had risen as high as 40 percent. \nUnlike industrial trainees and technical interns, \nco-ethnic migrant workers were not obligated to \nleave Japan upon the termination of their employment.\nThey were entitled to long-term residency \nand access to social welfare benefits.\nRather than roll back their blood-based rights, \nJustice Ministry officials sought to persuade \nNikkei migrants to leave Japan with a “pay-togo”\nprogram announced in April 2009. Modeled \non return-migration policies in Europe, the program\noffered ethnic Japanese workers from Bra-\nzil and Peru a one-time payment of 300,000 yen \n(the equivalent of about $3,000 at the time), plus \n200,000 yen for each dependent, in exchange for \ntheir voluntary repatriation and on the condition \nthat they would be ineligible for the same longterm\nvisa for at least three years. The program has \nhad its intended effect. Since 2009, the population \nof Brazilians and Peruvians in Japan has declined \nby more than 30 percent.\nMeanwhile, despite perennial complaints about \nlabor abuses, the trainee program proved effective \nin directing workers toward struggling small- and \nmedium-sized businesses, making an especially \nnotable impact in rural areas. Rather than abolish\nwhat conservative and liberal policy makers \nalike deemed an exploitative system, the Diet \npassed revisions to the Technical Intern Training\nProgram in 2009. These streamlined the two-\nstep trainee-to-intern sequence so that employers \ncould recruit technical interns directly, bypassing \nthe previous requirement that they hire industrial \ntrainees first.\nIn 2016, the Diet approved further revisions that \nstrengthened labor protections for trainees and \ntechnical interns while increasing the maximum \nstay from three to five years. Starting in 2015, the \nMinistry of Justice expanded quotas for particular\ncategories of trainees, especially construction \nworkers needed to help prepare for the 2020 Summer\nOlympics in Tokyo. The 2018 law establish-\ning an official guest-worker program has not been \naccompanied by legislative moves to abolish the \ntrainee program, suggesting that the former is \nmeant to complement rather than replace the latter\n(unlike a South Korean guest-worker program \nestablished in 2006, which replaced an industrial \ntrainee program).\nSIGNS OF CHANGE\nIs Japan a latecomer to immigration that will, in \ndue course, converge with other industrial democracies\nby liberalizing its immigration policies? Or \ndo the trajectories of other countries that are reluctant\nto accept immigration provide a roadmap \nfor Japan?\nAs in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, migrant \nworkers in Japan are not recognized as potential \ncitizens or permanent settlers by either the government\nor the public. Japan’s lingering reluctance to \nopen its borders to the extent necessary to alleviate\nlabor shortages and demographic deficits sug-\ngests that policy makers are still willing to forego \nthe significant economic gains that increased migration\ncould bring, if that is the price to be paid \nto avoid the social instability they fear will result \nfrom the permanent settlement of migrants largely \nfrom the global South.\nBut there are signs that Japan is changing. A \nNikkei/TV Tokyo poll conducted in October 2018 \nfound that 54 percent of Japanese voters supported\nAbe’s plan to admit more foreign workers \nto alleviate the country’s labor shortages. Another \npoll taken at the same time by the Yomiuri Shimbun \nnewspaper found that 51 percent were in favor of \nadmitting more unskilled foreign workers, while \n43 percent supported official recognition of “immigration”\nto Japan. The popularity of recently \nemerging multiracial public figures, such as the \ntennis star Naomi Osaka and the 2015 Miss Universe\nJapan, Ariana Miyamoto, also suggests that \nthe public has grown increasingly tolerant of diversity.\nIn explaining what many characterized as con-\nvergence toward increasingly liberal immigration \npolicies and expanded rights for immigrants from \nthe early 1970s until the populist backlash against \nimmigration in the United States and Europe of \nthe past decade, comparative studies of international\nmigration and citizenship have focused on \nthe influence of domestic political elites and international\nnorms or pressures. Scholars who em-\nphasize the latter contend that greater acceptance \nof global human rights norms and the growth of \ninstitutions promoting them were pushing industrial\ndemocracies on the whole toward liberal \ncitizenship and immigration policies characterized\nby relatively open borders, access to citizen-\nship status, and generous rights for resident foreigners—until\nthe early twenty-first century. But \nsome studies of immigration reform in Europe and \nNorth America focused on domestic drivers such \nJapan’s Model of Immigration Without Immigrants • 217\n', '218 • CURRENT HISTORY • September 2019\nas left-leaning parties, activist courts, and bureaucrats\nwho have expanded rights for noncitizens in \nresponse to domestic legal rulings.\nIf international norms and pressure pushed \nWestern democracies to liberalize their immigration\nand citizenship policies in the past, those \nforces have had an uneven and indeterminate impact\non East Asian democracies (and in the cur-\nrent political climate, their influence may often \nseem doubtful around the globe). Japan’s ratification\nof international conventions has led directly \nor indirectly to some reforms of policies pertaining \nto rights and citizenship. For example, in 1985, \nin accordance with international human rights \nnorms, the Nationality Act was amended to allow\nindividuals to acquire Japanese citizenship \nthrough either parent, not just the father.\nIn some areas, including social welfare benefits \nand access to public sector jobs, foreign residents \nhave gained rights that surpass those prescribed in \ninternational human rights treaties. But in other \nareas, Japan has remained immune to international\npressure. It continues to hold one of the \nworst records in the industrialized world for accepting\nrefugees. Reforms reflecting international \nnorms have thus been applied unevenly to different\ngroups within Japan and inconsistently across \npolicy domains, and they have not resulted in liberalization\nof immigration policies.\nMost reforms to Japan’s policies have reflected \nthe government’s aim of better controlling immigration,\nparticularly the irregular kind, rather \nthan incorporating immigrants into Japanese society.\nPolitical elites have prioritized social stability \nover liberal democratic principles in immigration \npolicy. Reforms have been implemented only after\nconsiderable pressure from internal grassroots \nmovements and international NGOs. In most cases,\ncourts, legislatures, and political parties have \nresponded grudgingly to grassroots demands.\nBecause Japan officially maintained closed-door \npolicies throughout the 1980s and 1990s, immigrants\nwithin its borders for the most part had \nto return to their home countries or face expulsion.\nImmigration policy reform and patterns of \nimmigrant incorporation were not the products of \ndeliberate decision making by the state to liberalize\npolicies according to international norms or to \nmanage the permanent settlement of immigrants.\nPOSTWAR HOMOGENIZATION\nThe notion that recent developments reflect Japan’s\nconvergence with Western liberal democra-\ncies on a path toward a liberal migration regime is \nbased on the erroneous assumption that immigration\nis a new phenomenon in Japan. In fact, as a \nformer imperial power that received its largest inflow\nof migrants before 1945, Japan was grappling \nwith the challenge of incorporating newcomers \nwell before its European counterparts encountered \nlarge-scale immigration. But neither the Japanese \ngovernment nor most members of the public ever \nacknowledged the presence of immigrants. Rather, \nthey have been referred to as colonial subjects, \nZainichi Koreans, Chinese, foreign residents—and \nnow, migrant workers.\nJapan’s immigration history as a former imperial\npower, coupled with its policies toward the \npopulation resulting from that legacy, have produced\na number of anomalies. To begin with, for-\nmer colonial subjects and their native-born descendants\nliving in Japan still constitute one of the \nlargest groups of foreign residents, even after the \nconsiderable growth of the immigrant community \nsince the late 1980s. For that reason, Japan has \nthe distinction of being the only advanced industrial\ndemocracy with a sixth-generation immigrant \nproblem. Japan also has one of the lowest naturalization\nrates among industrial democracies, with \nless than one percent of the foreign population \ngaining citizenship each year.\nBy the end of World War II, more than two \nmillion colonial subjects, primarily from the Korean\nPeninsula and Formosa (as Taiwan was then \nknown), were residing in Japan. Unlike European \nimperial powers that had far-flung colonies, Japan \ncolonized nearby territories. That allowed for large \nnumbers of migrants from those lands to enter the \nmetropole in the early stages of colonization. In \nthe later stages, it facilitated the forced recruitment\nof colonial subjects as laborers and soldiers. \nApproximately two-thirds of this population was \nrepatriated during the process of decolonization.\nWith the help of the American occupation authorities,\nJapan implemented strict immigration \nand border controls modeled on the US JohnsonReed\nImmigration Act of 1924, which set quotas \nbased on country of origin. Irregular immigration \nto Japan nevertheless became a major problem in \nthe years after the war, fueled largely by former \nrepatriates to the Korean Peninsula who fled instability\nfollowing Korea’s liberation from Japan in \n1945 and chaos during the Korean War from 1950 \nto 1953. By the end of the US occupation in 1952, \napproximately 700,000 foreigners, mostly former \ncolonial subjects, resided in Japan.\n', 'Japan’s Model of Immigration Without Immigrants • 219\nWhereas prewar Japanese state ideology had \nincluded ethnically diverse colonial subjects as \npart of the imperial “family nation,” the postwar \ndiscourse on Japanese national identity excluded \nthem by basing citizenship on the principle of \nconsanguinity. They were reclassified as aliens, \nwhile only those who were ethnically Japanese \nwere declared citizens. These postwar citizenship \npolicies—modeled on Germany’s—effectively removed\nformer colonial subjects from the body \npolitic. This marked Japan’s transition from a \nmulti ethnic empire to a procedurally democratic \nbut ethnically homogeneous nation.\nPostwar Japan’s policies regarding foreign residents\nwere thus based on an American-style im-\nmigration model and a German-style citizenship \nmodel—a combination that resulted in strict border\ncontrols, immigration quotas, and descent-\nbased citizenship policies. But Japan went a few \nsteps farther by closing the country’s borders to \nunskilled foreign labor, not introducing any exceptions\nto citizenship based on descent (such \nas granting citizenship automatically\nto third-generation \nresidents), and requiring both \nnative-born descendants of immigrants\nand co-ethnic new-\ncomers to undergo a formal \nnaturalization process to gain \ncitizenship.\nNONCITIZEN RIGHTS\nOne of the distinguishing characteristics of Japan’s\nmigration regime is the sequence by which \nits policies and programs took effect: efforts to \nincorporate immigrants into Japanese society, \ncarried out largely by civil society actors and local\ngovernments, preceded immigration policy re-\nform. That is, immigrant incorporation programs \nwere implemented at the local level even before \nnational-level policy makers and bureaucrats formally\nacknowledged the existence of immigrants \nwithin Japan’s borders.\nPostwar Japan’s citizenship and immigration \npolicies alone did not determine the anomalous status\nof long-term resident aliens. On the contrary, \nJapan’s sixth-generation immigrant problem reflects \nthe strategic interaction between government policies\nand the objectives of generations of activists \namong Koreans in Japan—or “Zainichi Koreans,” as \nmany in the community of former colonial subjects \nand their descendants call themselves. These activists\nhave aimed to leverage their status as “foreign-\nresident citizens” (gaikokujin shimin) of Japan to \ngain political visibility and power.\nUnlike most historically disenfranchised communities\nelsewhere, instead of seeking naturaliza-\ntion and becoming a small section of the voting \npopulation, social movements led by Zainichi Koreans\nsince the late 1960s have focused on their \npositions as permanent, contributing members of \ntheir local communities, deserving of rights equal \nto those enjoyed by Japanese nationals. This strategy\ngave birth to a noncitizen civil rights move-\nment. At its heart was the struggle to remove the \nfundamental barriers that Korean residents faced \nin their daily lives, but without changing their legal\nstatus as foreign nationals.\nForeign residents in Japan routinely faced discrimination\nin employment, housing, education, \nand health care until the late 1970s. By the early\n1980s, however, their formal legal status and \nrights were on par with those of immigrants in \nother advanced industrial democracies. In a series \nof struggles starting in the late 1960s, they gained \nsocial welfare benefits, access to \npublic-sector employment, and \nin some localities, the inclusion \nof ethnic or “multicultural” \neducation in public school curricula,\nas well as the repeal of \na requirement that they register \ntheir fingerprints with the government.\nZainichi Koreans and \ntheir advocates then turned their efforts to securing\nlocal voting rights, as growing numbers of new \nimmigrants from all over the globe began to settle \nin communities throughout Japan.\nIn the absence of national programs and policies\nfor new immigrants, institutions previously \nused to incorporate Zainichi Koreans in Japanese \nsociety took on the mission of incorporating new \nimmigrants in their local communities. Instead of \nconfronting an insular society wholly unprepared \nfor large-scale immigration, new immigrants were \nassisted by hundreds of civil society organizations \nthat offered services, support, and advocacy specifically\nfor foreign residents.\nImmigrants with secure legal status benefited \nfrom earlier gains by Zainichi Koreans that made \nforeign residents eligible for a range of social welfare\nbenefits and legal protections. But the existing \nservices and programs had been created for permanently\nsettled, highly assimilated, and in many \ncases native-born but noncitizen residents, not for \nrecently arrived migrant workers. As a result, the \nThe guest-worker system \nis consistent with the \nincremental steps that Japan \nhas taken over the years.\n', '220 • CURRENT HISTORY • September 2019\npriorities of pro-immigrant advocacy groups were \noften determined by long-settled migrants whose \ninterests did not necessarily align with those of \nthe newer arrivals. For example, some civil society \ngroups and local communities have focused their \nenergies on campaigning for local voting rights for \nforeign residents. That may be a low priority for \nrecent immigrants who lack Japanese-language \nfluency and are struggling just to get basic information\nabout schools, hospitals, and health insur-\nance. \nThe ideas that emerged from earlier Zainichi Korean\nsocial movements continue to shape how ac-\ntivists, and even some local governments, approach \npolitical empowerment for foreign residents in the \nKorean and non-Korean foreign-resident communities.\nInstead of guiding new immigrants on \nthe path to naturalization, local institutions and \ncivil society organizations have emphasized their \nrights as foreign residents and encouraged them \nto participate in the public sphere as noncitizen \nmembers of their local communities by joining \nactivities such as neighborhood \nrevitalization campaigns and \ncultural exchange programs.\nLEADING THE WAY?\nAs recent developments in \nthe United States and Europe \nshow, immigration has lost \nnone of its power to provoke a range of nationalistic\nresponses. They may take the form of xeno-\nphobic demands to expel all foreigners, alarmist \nperceptions that immigrants from diverse ethnocultural\nbackgrounds pose a threat to social sta-\nbility and national security, or simply an effort to \ndistinguish “us” from “them.” Recent immigration \nin Japan has been met with the full gamut of these \nresponses. As a result of the more virulent strains, \nJapan has earned a reputation for being a society \nthat is hostile to immigrants.\nAdvocates of Japan’s “closed-door” (sakoku) \npolicy argue that opening its doors to foreigners\nwould result in unmanageable psychological \nand biological chaos. In recent years, politicians \nand the popular press have sensationalized stories\nabout foreigners and the growing crime rate, \nconflating visa overstayers, violent criminals, \nand post-9/11 terrorists. These stories have been \npicked up and amplified in Internet chat rooms \nand forums, spurring the development of what \nthe media calls the netto uyoku (Internet far right). \nThe largest Internet forum in Japan, 2channel, has \nbecome a platform for anonymous posts expressing\nanti-Korean, anti-Chinese, and generally anti-\nforeign sentiment.\nThere has also been an increase in vocal antiimmigrant\nsentiment in the public sphere—target-\ning Koreans in particular—through such organizations\nas the Zaitoku-kai, a “citizens group” that \nopposes what it calls “special rights for Koreans in \nJapan.” During marches through neighborhoods \nwith high concentrations of Korean residents, \nmembers of the Zaitoku-kai have waved the Rising \nSun war flag of Imperial Japan, shouting slogans \nsuch as “Kill Korean residents” and calling them \n“cockroaches.”\nBut there are key differences between what is \noccurring in Japan and in European countries \nwith respect to anti-immigrant movements and \nright-wing politics. First, the return of the conservative\nLDP to power in 2012—the party has ruled \nJapan since 1955 with only two brief interruptions \nin 1993–94 and 2009–12—did not resemble the \nrise of far-right parties in Europe. What might be \ncalled “fringe” parties, such as \nthe neoconservative Nippon \nIshin No Kai (Japan Restoration\nParty), have emerged in \nJapan, but their popularity has \nproved short-lived. Second, the \npolitical establishment in Japan \nhas not served as an instrument \nthrough which rightist groups can articulate antiimmigrant\nideologies.\nBy contrast, in European countries that have \nwitnessed the rise of the far right, such as Italy, \nAustria, and Hungary, elected leaders and political\nparties in power have articulated explicit anti- \nimmigrant ideologies. This difference may be \nlargely attributable to the fact that far-right parties \nin Europe were elected on anti-immigration platforms,\nwhereas the LDP returned to power with a \nmandate to oversee an economic recovery. And it \nwas the LDP, not the more centrist opposition parties,\nthat introduced the recent legislation to allow \nunskilled labor immigration for the first time since \nWorld War II.\nThat is perhaps the most significant difference: \nunlike European countries, Japan kept its borders\nclosed to unskilled immigrants even as the \nworking-age population steadily declined (the \ngovernment forecasts it will be just over 50 percent\nof the total population by 2050). In Japan, \nanti-immigrant (and especially anti-Korean) sentiment\nis not a backlash against open immigra-\nJapan has one of the lowest \nnaturalization rates among \nindustrial democracies.\n', 'Japan’s Model of Immigration Without Immigrants • 221\ntion policies; it is a reflection of the unresolved \ncontradictions that stem from prewar policies. \nJapan stands out among advanced industrial democracies\nnot for a shift to the right on immigra-\ntion, but for the remarkable stability of its restrictive\nimmigration and citizenship policies.\nFar from lagging decades behind Western democracies\non the path toward becoming a liber-\nal migration state, Japan has been on a different \ntrajectory altogether.
