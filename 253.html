        <pre>['From divergent evolution to witting cross-fertilisation: the\nneed for more awareness of potential inter-discursive\ncommunication regarding students’ extended historical\nwriting\nJames Edward Carroll a,b\naHistory Department, Esher College, Thames Ditton, UK; bFaculty of Education, University of Cambridge,\nCambridge, UK\nARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 1 October 2016\nAccepted 6 March 2017\nABSTRACT\nHistory education stakeholders in England have consistently judged\nthat some students find formal historical writing prohibitively\ndifficult due to the demands of constructing an extended\nargument. While policy makers have agreed students need support\nin their historical writing, recurring themes in centralised resourcing\nhave been wastage, incoordination and replication. Furthermore,\ntwo concurrent but largely disconnected discourses have\ndeveloped and promulgated initiatives relevant to students’\nextended historical writing: ‘genre theorists’ and the ‘history\nteachers’ extended writing movement’. Despite certain goals held in\ncommon participants in the two discourses have tended to talk past\none another with concomitant issues in resourcing. Unsystematic,\ncross-fertilisation between the discourses has led to cycles of genre\ntheory being collectively discovered, forgotten, and rediscovered by\nhistory teachers with knowledge not being built cumulatively.\nFurthermore both discourses have independently developed similar\ninitiatives in a form of convergent evolution resulting in duplication\nof labour. Finally, divergent evolution has occurred where genre\ntheorists have advocated approaches that are increasingly\nredundant for history teachers’ requirements. A more activist stance\nis therefore required to ensure meaningful inter-discursive\ncommunication between genre theorists and the history teachers’\n‘extended writing movement’ to ensure efficacy in developing\napproaches to improving students’ extended historical writing.\nKEYWORDS\nHistorical argument; literacy;\ngenre theory; extended\nwriting movement\nIntroduction\nWhy history writing is hard\nAs I agonise over this sentence, I am reminded once again that formal academic writing is\nhard. Furthermore, historical writing presents its own particular challenges. History teachers\nand education researchers in England have consistently judged that some students\nfind formal historical writing prohibitively difficult because the subject demands the\nCONTACT James Edward Carroll jcarroll@esher.ac.uk\n© 2017 British Educational Research Association\nTHE CURRICULUM JOURNAL, 2017\nVOL. 28, NO. 4, 504–523\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/09585176.2017.1308261\n', 'simultaneous mastery of a multitude of variables in order to produce a coherent piece of\nextended written historical argument (Counsell, 1997). Many of these demands are rooted\nin the fact that school history in England requires students to construct their own\nextended written historical arguments in order to achieve the highest levels of attainment\n(Coffin, 2006). These arguments that students are expected to construct are in response\nto historical questions that are open-ended and permit a number of plausible responses\nthat may be credited.\nFurthermore, different types of argument are required depending on the – or combination\nof – ‘second order concept(s)’ the students are being asked to analyse. These ‘second\norder concepts’, which were originally specified by the English National Curriculum\n(Department for Education & Science, 1991), encapsulate the type of questions which\nmembers of the historical discipline commonly investigate regarding the past (Fordham,\n2016). These ‘second order concepts’ – for example ‘causation’, ‘change and continuity’\nand ‘similarity and difference’– all demand their own particular compositional and linguistic\nconventions when argued in extended historical writing (e.g. causation Carroll, 2016a;\n2016b; change and continuity Foster, 2013; similarity and difference Black, 2012). Accordingly,\nstudents must divine what they have learnt in terms of its applicability in relation to\na question pertaining to a particular second-order concept. This distinguishing of information\nrelated to an overarching topic from evidence especially pertinent to a conceptually\nspecific enquiry according to a workable concept of ‘question-relevance’ often proves\nproblematical for students (Counsell, 1997, p. 13; Laffin, 2000).\nAs a consequence of the exacting emphasis on conceptually specific argument, many\nhistory teachers have attested to substantial demands on students’ short-term memory\nwhen planning, organising and writing history essays (Byrom, 1998; Counsell, 1997).\nAccordingly, some history teacher-researchers advocate alleviating the strain on shortterm\nmemory in terms of recall of substantive knowledge to allow the memory to focus\non the construction of argument. For example, some teachers advocate ‘card sort’ activities\nutilising knowledge cards to support recall and allow students to concentrate on the\nthematic organisation of their response to the specific type of second-order problem that\nneeds to be argued in writing (e.g. Carroll, 2016a; Evans & Pate, 2007). A differing\napproach to the issue of memory demands developed by some history teacher-researchers\nis to emphasise the necessity of certain knowledge being consolidated in students’\nlong-term memory to ensure that short-term memory can be free to make vocabulary recognition\nand formulation of specific argument possible (e.g. Hammond, 2014; King, 2015).\nThe recall, selection and organisation of knowledge relevant to particular types of question\ntherefore represent a significant challenge for secondary students when arguing in\ntheir extended historical writing.\nAdditionally, students must also be alert to the lexical conventions of historical prose,\nwhich often includes especially conceptualised, subject-specific vocabulary (Counsell,\n1997; Harris, 2001; Woodcock, 2005). Again, this lexis is often specific to the particular second-order\nconcept under investigation. Historical lexicogrammar (structures of words)\noften requires students to appreciate that historical information is packaged into highly\nabstracted concepts to give it meaning (Bakalis, 2003; Counsell, 1997). Attempting to command\nand formulate such lexicogrammar presents challenges for students. For example,\nwhile some second-order concepts in history resonate with commonly-held human\nunderstandings typically expressed in everyday spoken language, formal historical writing\nTHE CURRICULUM JOURNAL 505\n', 'instead demands such concepts be articulated in increasingly technical, abstract and\n‘uncommonsense’ expression (Schleppegrell, 2011). For example, students encounter causation\nin ‘everyday’ contexts from a personalised perspective over short time scales –\nsuch as appreciating they got into trouble with their teacher because they forgot their\nhomework. Historical discourse, however, demands the re-appropriation of this ostensibly\nstraightforward concept to depersonalised abstractions across timescales beyond the\nrealm of their lived experience – for example, in arguing that German anti-Semitism originating\nin the Middle Ages contributed to the Holocaust (Howson & Shemilt, 2011).\nThis level of formal abstraction often proves taxing for students. Because success in history\nis dependent on proficiency in arguing in extended analytic writing, exacting requirements\nsuch as these at the levels of overall structure and lexicogrammar are sometimes\ncited as the reason why lower-attaining students are denied access to a historical education\nbeyond the compulsory phase (Andrews, 1995; Banham, 1998; Coffin, 2006; Donaghy,\n2013; Harris, 2001; Ward, 2006).\nPolicy makers’ concern\nPolicy makers in England have been alert to this critical factor affecting the exclusion of\nthe majority of students from post-compulsory study of history (Counsell, 2011a). Until\nthe 1990s, the norm for most of England’s secondary school students was not to write\nextended analytical prose, for while the traditional essay was a fixture of the History OLevel\nexamination, fewer than 20 per cent of students sat these exams (Phillips, 1998). A\nconsequence of this exclusivity of access to formal, historical academic argument was the\nangst caused by the School Examinations and Assessment Council’s (1993) findings in the\nearly 1990s which highlighted the alarming standards of students’ extended historical\nwriting. Since then, successive governments have made concerted – yet uncoordinated –\nattempts to raise standards. Initially, the School Curriculum Assessment Authority (SCAA)\ncreated widely disseminated materials partly based on consultation with history education\nexperts (SCAA, 1997). While the anxiety at the standard of students’ extended histori-\ncal writing remained, the approach to remedying the issue altered with the Labour\ngovernment in the 2000s with their National Literacy Strategies. Although much centralised\nguidance was still produced, it tended to de-emphasise the subject-specific advances\nof history teachers (Counsell, 2004). Instead, a more generic, genre theory-inspired\napproach to literacy in history was privileged, in which students were instructed to recognise\nand reproduce strictly delineated genres (Department for Education and Skills\n(DfEaS), 2002). This guidance (a) tended to ignore the way in which those genres were\nblended in history education practice; and (b) failed to note the key drivers of advances in\nhistory education – particularly the development of using the subject’s constituent second-order\nconcepts as a framework to construct argument.\nFor example, the National Literacy Strategy recommended that students be taught specific\ntext types; especially the ‘main categories of non-fiction writing’ such as ‘instruction,\nrecount, explanation, information, persuasion, discursive writing, analysis, and evaluation’\n(DfEaS, 2002 pp. 19–20). This strict delineation of ‘genres’ based on generic application of\n‘non-fiction writing’ conventions conflicted with some teachers’ history-specific recommendations\nthat were emerging at the time. For example, Lang (2003) argued that the\nartificial demarcation of school history genres had led to school history becoming\n506 J. E. CARROLL\n', 'divorced from its academic antecedent. Academic history, Lang argued, was characterised\nby being generally narrative (recount); while also being highly explanatory, informative,\npersuasive, discursive, analytical, and evaluative. Furthermore, there was little latitude\nwith these generic text types applicable to all ‘non-fiction’ for history teachers to fine-tune\nthem specifically to the second-order concepts that the government’s own history curriculum\ndemanded. Generic ‘analysis’ or ‘discursive writing’, for example, offered only general\nguidelines relevant to the particular types of analyses required with different historical\nsecond-order concepts: such as causation as opposed to change and continuity. In sum, it\nwould appear that while policy makers have agreed that students need support in their\nhistorical writing, recurring themes in resourcing have been wastage, incoordination and\nreplication.\nDevelopment of differing discourses to students’ historical writing\nLack of practical coordination in policy is only one symptom of the way in which history\nteacher-generated solutions, even where the resulting discourse is internally coherent,\ncumulative, theorised and published, fail to travel into parallel spaces beyond the subject\ncommunity, resulting in replication, misrepresentation or waste. Two concurrent but\nlargely disconnected discourses have emerged that have sought to develop and promulgate\nideas and initiatives relevant to students’ extended historical writing: ‘genre theorists’\nand the ‘history teachers’ extended writing movement’. As these discourses have crystallised\nand become more specialised, the likelihood of their interaction appears to have\nlessened (Becher, 1993; Clark, 1963). This may be partly the result of what Campbell (1969;\ncf. Becher, 1993) identified as ‘tribalism or nationalism or ingroup partisanship’ (p. 40)\nwhich, in some senses, has promoted an ‘artificial alienation and distance between even\nclosely-related specialities on either side of a boundary’ (Becher, 1993, p. 40).\nAustralian genre theory\nFirst, genre-based approaches to school literacy inspired by Hallidayan systemic functional\nlinguistics (SFL) have been influential for some time. As early as the 1960s the originator of\nSFL, Michael Halliday, was invited to develop an English Curriculum proposal for the Nuffield\nFoundation; leading to the Nuffield/Schools Council Programme in Linguistics and\nEnglish Teaching (1964–71). This programme produced extensive materials for schools\nwhich were ‘influential in their day, and some of which remain in use’ (Christie, 2007, p. 5;\nChristie & Unsworth, 2005; Hasan & Martin, 1989). By the 1990s, SFL had a ‘reasonably\nwell-established history of involvement in education, having been drawn upon in a number\nof educational projects and reports in the UK’ – for example in the development of\nthe Language in the National Curriculum Project (Christie, 1998, pp. 52–53).\nIn fact, Hallidayan ideas were so influential that they were institutionally enshrined with\nthe Labour government’s National Literacy Strategies (DfEaS, 2002, p. 20) which were\nheavily inspired by repurposed SFL genre-based pedagogies as advocated by the ‘Sydney\nSchool’ of ‘genre theorists’ (e.g. Christie, 1985; Martin, 1985). Genre theorists have been\nheavily influenced by Michael Halliday’s notion of ‘functional grammar’ which suggests\nthat the context in which language is produced strongly determines the grammatical\nchoices that one makes. A great deal of work of the ‘Sydney School’ and its supporters,\nparticularly initially by Martin (e.g. 1992), has attempted to apply Halliday’s ideas\nTHE CURRICULUM JOURNAL 507\n', 'pedagogically by identifying the text types and genres common in school history in a variety\nof international contexts (e.g. Christie & Derewianka, 2008; Coffin, 1997, 2000, 2004,\n2006; Coffin & Derewianka, 2008a, 2008b; Eggins, Martin, & Wignell, 1993; Martin, 2002,\n2003; Martin & Rose, 2003, 2008; McNamara, 1989; Ote\x01ıza, 2003; Schleppegrell, 2011;\nSchleppegrell, Achugar, & Ote\x01ıza, 2004; Unsworth, 1999; Veel & Coffin, 1996). In this view,\nwriters typically make particular choices according to particular social contexts, leading to\n‘predictable text structures or genres’ (Coffin, 2006, p. 27). ‘Genre’, in this view, has a specifically\nnarrow meaning referring to why language was produced, and has been\ndescribed as a ‘staged, purposeful, goal-directed activity represented in language’\n(Christie, 1998, p. 53). Once genres have been deconstructed, they can be explicitly taught\nto pupils who can be ‘apprenticed’ into reproducing them (Donaghy, 2013). Genre theorists\nargue that due to their importance in building and communicating written informa-\ntion such genres need to be ‘the subject of overt teaching and learning’ so that students\ncan become more competent in their uses (Christie & Misson, 1998, p. 11). For example,\none of the most ardent history practitioners advocating this genre-based approach, Donaghy\n(2013), guides students to produce genres such as ‘factorial explanation’ or ‘argument\n– exposition’. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of these initiatives in English schools\nwere the recommendations, building on Australian genre theory, of Maureen Lewis and\nDavid Wray (e.g. Wray and Lewis, 1997) at Exeter University of ‘writing frames’ to support\nand develop students’ extended writing.\nEnglish history teachers’ ‘extended writing movement’\nA second discourse to emerge in the last fifteen years related to students’ historical\nwriting has been dubbed the English history teachers’ ‘extended writing movement’\n(Counsell, 2011a, p. 16). While this label is necessarily imperfect and members of the\n‘movement’ may not recognise themselves by such a term, for the purposes of this article\nit will be applied to a group of approximately forty researchers which has been largely,\nthough not exclusively, teacher-led and have independently developed approaches to\nimproving students’ extended written arguments. Similarly to the English policy makers,\nthis movement had its origins in the concern of the 1990s regarding the standard of students’\nextended historical writing and sought to give the teaching of written historical\nargument a specific focus. What united the ‘movement’ was a concern to solve a problem\nof practice based on awareness that extended historical writing was still avoided by many\nhistory teachers, given that there was little enforced requirement to do so despite it being\nthe mode of expression though which academic historical knowledge is constructed.\nFrom this starting point, many of these teachers began to consider what characterises academic\nhistorical writing and to identify which of these historically specific characteristics\nstudents find challenging. In beginning this theorisation, these teachers and education\nresearchers took the initiative themselves by placing primacy on the disciplinary underpinnings\nof historical writing (Banham, 1998; Counsell, 1997; Dove, 2000; Harris, 2001; Laf-\nfin, 2000; Mulholland, 1998; Waters, 2003; Wiltshire, 2000). Consequently, many teacherresearchers\nover the last fifteen years have attempted to ensure literacy is not ‘bolted on’\n(Counsell, 2004, pp. 4 and 111) to the history, but instead serves and emerges organically\nfrom the discipline, distinct from other subjects (Counsell, 2011a; Ward, 2006; Woodcock,\n2005). Perhaps as a reaction against the centralised national push for historical approaches\nto literacy in the National Literacy Strategies that failed to adequately integrate subject508\nJ. E. CARROLL\n', 'specificity even while trying to provide guidance on it, participants in the ‘extended writing\nmovement’ have increasingly used the subject’s second-order concepts as a frame-\nwork to explore how to enable students to construct conceptually specific written\narguments (e.g. causation Carroll, 2016a, 2016b; Woodcock, 2005; change and continuity\nFoster, 2013, Jarman, 2009; similarity and difference Black, 2012; Bradshaw, 2009; evidential\nthinking Foster & Gadd, 2013).\nIn recognising commonly experienced difficulties students face with historical writing,\nthe ‘extended writing movement’ shares a number of aims with genre theorists. For example,\nlike genre theorists (e.g. Christie, 2007), this ‘movement’ intended to ensure that\nextended historical writing was made accessible to the whole ability range, rather than an\nexclusive elite: an ambitious task that required a ‘discrete and systematic teaching focus\nof its own’ (Byrom, 1998, p. 32). An additional point of agreement between genre theorists\n(e.g. Donaghy, 2013) and the ‘extended writing movement’ (e.g. Foster, 2015) therefore is\nthat history teachers should take more responsibility for this subject-specific literacy\ninstruction. Furthermore, both discourses emphasise the need for students to be made\nexplicitly aware of the formal registers valued in academic historical writing (Andrews,\n1995; Coffin, 2006; Donaghy, 2013; Evans & Pate, 2007; Waters, 2003).\nYet despite certain goals held in common by genre theorists and the history teachers’\n‘extended writing movement’ the two discourses have tended to talk past one another.\nHere, I have used Fordham’s (2015) definition of a published ‘discourse’ where themes\nhave emerged which have been addressed by a number of teachers and/or researchers in\ntheir writing, with subsequent teachers and/or researchers advancing the conversation\nfurther by explicit reference to those who wrote before (p. 139). In surveying these two\nterritories, I have discerned a systemic lack of communication between the two discourses.\nFirst, I shall outline the trends of limited cross-traffic between the two discourses\nwith salient examples (see Figure 1); and sketch concomitant issues with resourcing that\nhave developed as a consequence. In doing so I will argue that a more activist stance is\nrequired to ensure meaningful inter-discursive communication between genre theorists\nand the history teachers’ ‘extended writing movement’ to ensure more efficacy in developing\napproaches to improving students’ extended historical writing (Campbell, 1969).\nA taxonomy of the interrelationship between the discourses\nWitting yet unsystematic cross-fertilisation\nFirst, a chronological perspective of the literature reveals the collective amnesia and rediscovery\nof genre theory by history education stakeholders. For example, centralised initia-\ntives rooted in SFL like the National Literacy Strategies have garnered history education\nadvocates in English primary and secondary schools with some history teachers extolling\ntheir ‘mind-blowing ideas of functional literacy and its genre theory that underpinned\ntheir pioneering and radical creation of writing frames’ (Nichol, 2011, pp. 8–9). Despite\nsome history educators suggesting ‘genre theory was a blinding revelation, an epiphanic\nmoment’ (Nuffield Primary History Project, 2012, p. 20), these epiphanies have often not\nbeen built upon; partly because the lineage of the initiatives has not been made explicit.\nFor example, these insufficient explanations of the genealogy of even such established\napproaches as the National Literacy Strategies has resulted in isolated practitioners\nTHE CURRICULUM JOURNAL 509\n', 'W\ni\x02\nng\n c\nro\nss\n –\nfe\nr\x03\nlis\na\x03\non\n \ne.\ng.\n•\nM\nar\n\x02n\n, C\noffi\nn \n&\n N\nor\nth\n 2\n00\n7;\n  \n•\nN\nic\nho\nl, \n20\n11\n \n•\nDo\nna\ngh\ny \n20\n13\nU\nnw\ni\x02\nng\n c\nro\nss\n –\nfe\nr\x03\nlis\na\x03\non\n \ne.\ng.\n \n•\nEx\npl\nic\nit \non\n te\nxt\n ty\npe\ns \n•\nPa\nra\ngr\nap\nh \nhe\nur\nis\x02\ncs\n \n•\nW\nri\x02\nng\n fr\nam\nes\nEx\nte\nnd\ned\n w\nri\x02\nng\n m\nov\nem\nen\nt\nCo\nnv\ner\nge\nnt\n e\nvo\nlu\n\x03o\nn\ne.\ng.\n•\n‘N\nom\nin\nal\nisa\n\x02o\nn’\n / \n‘B\nig\n p\noi\nnt\ns’\n, \n•\n‘S\nho\nw\nin\ng \npr\noc\nes\nse\ns’\n/’\nTe\nlli\nng\n a\nnd\n su\ngg\nes\n\x02n\ng’\n \n•\n‘C\nau\nse\n w\nith\nin\n th\ne \ncl\nau\nse\n’/\n W\noo\ndc\noc\nki\nan\n c\nau\nsa\nl l\nan\ngu\nag\ne \n•\n‘C\nol\nou\nrin\ng’\n/I\nnt\ner\npr\net\na\x02\non\ns \nDi\nve\nrg\nen\nt e\nvo\nlu\n\x03o\nn\ne.\ng.\n•\nEx\npl\nic\nit \nfo\ncu\ns o\nn \nle\nxi\nco\ngr\nam\nm\nar\n \n•\nAc\nce\npt\nan\nce\n o\nf ‘\nbi\nas\n’, \n‘re\nlia\nbi\nlit\ny’\n a\nnd\n ‘t\nru\nth\nfu\nln\nes\ns’\n \nDi\nve\nrg\nen\nt e\nvo\nlu\n\x03o\nn\ne.\ng.\n•\nLa\nck\n o\nf e\nxp\nlic\nit \nfo\ncu\ns o\nn \nle\nxi\nco\ngr\nam\nm\nar\n \n•\nRe\nje\nc\x02\non\n o\nf ‘\nbi\nas\n’, \n‘re\nlia\nbi\nlit\ny’\n a\nnd\n ‘t\nru\nth\nfu\nln\nes\ns’\n \nGe\nnr\ne \nth\neo\nris\nts\nFi\ngu\nre\n1.\nPa\ntt\ner\nns\nof\nde\nve\nlo\npm\nen\ntb\net\nw\nee\nn\nth\ne\ndi\nsc\nou\nrs\nes\nof\nge\nnr\ne\nth\neo\nry\nan\nd\nth\ne\nex\nte\nnd\ned\nw\nrit\nin\ng\nm\nov\nem\nen\nt.\n510 J. E. CARROLL\n', 'continuing to make similar ‘breakthroughs’ afresh that in reality mirror pre-existing, widely\ndisseminated materials. For example, the history teacher and blogger Donaghy (2013)\nargued that after an ‘enormous amount of thought into my approach to teaching over\nthe past 2 years’ it was ‘vital’ to share his ‘new-style’ ‘genre-based pedagogy’ heavily influenced\nby Halliday and the Sydney School. As well as his reading of Coffin (2006) in particu-\nlar, his reflection was inspired, in part, by a reaction to the increasing orthodoxy in English\nschools of ‘painfully limited and limiting’ paragraph structure heuristics such as ‘P-E-E’\n(Point, Evidence, Explanation). ‘P-E-E’ and other models designed to enable students to\norganise paragraphs coherently (e.g. ‘PEEL’ (Point, Evidence, Explanation, Link) Fordham,\n2007, p. 37; ‘PEGEX’ (Point, Evidence, Explanation) Evans & Pate, 2007, p. 26); ‘hamburger\nparagraphs’ Banham, 1998, p. 10; and ‘evidence sandwiches’ Mulholland, 1998, p. 17)\nhave become increasingly ubiquitous in English secondary schools (Foster & Gadd, 2013).\nIronically, however, it is highly likely that these scaffolds were, like Donaghy’s genre-based\npedagogy, in fact directly influenced by genre theory – particularly Martin’s (1992, pp.\n454–456) suggestion that students’ paragraphs be clearly organised by hypertheme, evidence\nand hypernew. In this structure, ‘topics are introduced in the Hypertheme, and\ngrounds (evidence) are in the middle of paragraphs’ and ‘it is important to notice the end\nof paragraphs as this is where the hypernew or claims tends to be most explicit’ (Nesi &\nGardner, 2012, p. 110). As Counsell, Burn, Fordham, and Foster (2015) noted, ‘intellectual\ncross-currents such as Australian genre theory are all too easily hidden. But they matter.\nWe need to know who has followed (or reacted against) what and why. Otherwise we reinvent\nwheels both round and square’ (p. 17).\nUnwitting cross-fertilisation\nSecond, a further consequence of centralised initiatives like the National Literacy Strategies\nnot being clearly demarcated as Hallidayan in their origin has been unwitting cross-\nfertilisation between the two discourses – where history teachers seeking to improve students’\nextended writing have been influenced by genre theory without apparently being\ncognisant of the stimulus for their approach. This unwitting cross-fertilisation has been\nmost evident in the form of heavy emphases on ‘text types’ and ‘writing frames’ which\nbecame commonplace in history departments in the early 21st century. For example, following\ngovernmental guidance, students have increasingly been instructed to write ‘nar-\nratives, descriptions, explanations and interpretations’, so ‘that any question chosen fits\nneatly into of these writing types.’ (Scott, 2006, p. 28); yet teachers advocating such focus\non text types have been doing so without any apparent awareness of the fact that these\ncentralised initiatives had Hallidayan origins. Similarly, around the turn of the century,\nearly developments in the ‘extended writing movement’ clearly displayed vestiges of the\nSFL-influenced National Literacy Strategies. This influence, however, was apparently often\nunwitting and usually failed to cite its genre theory antecedents. For example, genre theorists\nsuggest the explicit teaching of essay structure and paragraph cohesion, suggesting\nthat it is essential in developing the ‘textual metafunction’ – the intention to engender or\ncreate cohesion in texts (Coffin, 2006, p. 39). Similarly, history teachers recommended\nwhole-text (Banham, 1998; Harris, 2001); paragraph (Bakalis, 2003; Banham, 1998; Mulholland,\n1998) and sentence starter (Banham, 1998; Carlisle, 2000; Wiltshere, 2000; Smith,\n2001) writing frames. Very quickly, however, some history teachers in the ‘extended writing\nmovement’ sought to distinguish their scaffolding of writing structures from genre\nTHE CURRICULUM JOURNAL 511\n', 'theory-inspired guidance. In particular, teachers in the ‘extended writing movement’\nattempted to shun cross-subject genericism in order to render such frames disciplinarily\nhistorical. As Counsell (2011a) suggested teachers grew frustrated because Lewis and\nWray’s writing frames ‘treated writing (and reading) as managing free-floating, non-subject\nspecific “information” rather than examining its role fostering the relational structures,\nsubstantive concepts and evidential modes particular to individual disciplines’ (p. 68) Consequently,\nsome history teacher-researchers began to react against the perceived limiting\nof students’ historical analysis as a result of using such frames (Counsell, 1997; Evans &\nPate, 2007). Furthermore, starting with Woodcock (2005), debates regarding students’ historical\nliteracy began to shift from structure to incorporate debates about style specifically\ntailored to enable argument in relation to history’s specific second-order concepts (e.g.\nBradshaw, 2009; Fielding, 2015; Foster, 2013; Jarman, 2009; Woodcock, 2005). In sum, history\nteachers have been, on occasion, unwittingly influenced by and critical of SFL-\ninspired approaches without necessarily being cognisant of the inter-discursive quality of\ntheir contributing to, critiquing and developing of public knowledge.\nIt would appear then that even on the rare occasions that there has been cross-fertilisation\nbetween the discourses of genre theory and the ‘extended writing movement’ –\neither wittingly in collaborative projects between genre theorists and teachers (e.g. Coffin,\nNorth & Martin, 2007) or teachers clearly citing genre theory (e.g. Donaghy, 2013; Nichol,\n2011); or unwittingly through development of techniques actually Hallidayan in origin –\nthis inter-discursive cross-traffic has not resulted in this potentially cumulative knowledge\nbeing sufficiently identified and/or suitably disseminated as examples of fruitful cross-fertilisation.\nThis inadequately cumulated cross- fertilisation has led to repetition and there-\nfore wastage for history teachers and policy makers who appeared to have cyclically and\ncollectively discovered, forgotten, critiqued and rediscovered genre theory and the potential\nit has for developing students’ historical writing (e.g. Donaghy, 2013).\nFurthermore, with rare exceptions (e.g. Coffin et al., 2007), this cross-fertilisation has\nbeen almost uniformly one-way. While history teacher-researchers in England have occasionally\ndrawn on genre theory, SFLs have been seemingly incognisant of the possibility\nof drawing on the cumulative, disciplinary knowledge of English history teachers. The\nboundaries between the discourses may be more closely defended from the genre theorists’\nside because its disciplinary community is more tightly knit and clearly self-defining\nwith shared fundamental ideologies and common values. With a stronger awareness of\nbelonging to a unique tradition genre theorists therefore may be more likely to defend\nwell-defined external disciplinary frontiers (Bacher, 1993). Conversely, the ‘extended writing\nmovement’ is more divergent and loosely knit lacking such a clear sense of mutual\ncohesion and identity; resulting in their border zones functioning more as a semi-permeable\nmembrane. Furthermore, the ‘extended writing movement’ has largely been teacher-\nled. Consequently, many academics might not recognise the movement as an academic\ndiscourse which is cumulative, theoretically powerful and generative (Counsell, 2011a,\n2011b; Fordham, 2015). In short, even when potentially fruitful cross-fertilisation might\nhave taken place systematic measures have not yet been taken to maximise the yield,\nresulting in unnecessary duplication and wastage in labour and resourcing. Further interdiscursive\nwork is needed to ensure that such a time loop is broken. This communication\nonly seems plausible through the allowance of greater latitude between the discourses’\nadjoining and overlapping boundaries.\n512 J. E. CARROLL\n', 'Convergent evolution\nIn fact, the wider trend has been for the two discourses to largely ignore one another\nentirely. In some instances this lack of communication has led to examples of potentially\nunnecessary reinvention because, despite representing different lineages, the two discourses\nhave been faced with similar ecological niches in the history classroom. Conse-\nquently, both discourses have independently developed similar responses in a form of\nconvergent evolution resulting in further duplication of labour.\nOne example of convergent evolution has been both discourses’ attempts to make the\nneed for abstracted generalisation in formal historical writing explicit to students. Genre\ntheorists have increasingly argued for the need for history students to be made aware of\nthe importance of ‘nominalisation’ in formal academic writing. Especially in ‘everyday’\nconversation there is stratal harmony with experience construed congruently (Christie &\nDerewianka, 2008). In other words, in conversational interaction grammar tends to match\nsemantics with a ‘natural pairing off’ (Martin, 2007, p. 52) of processes with verbs, participants\nwith nouns, qualities with adjectives and logical relations with conjunctions. For\nexample, an informal sentence might read ‘the peasants [noun/participants] were angry\n[adjective/quality] about their wages going down [verb/process] after enclosure so [conjunction/logical\nrelation] they rebelled [verb/process] in 1549’.\nIn formal discourse, however, Halliday (e.g. Halliday, 1998; Halliday & Matthiessen, 1999)\nidentified what genre theorists believe to be a vital phenomenon distinguishing informal\ndiscourse from formal academic writing – ‘grammatical metaphor’ (see Figure 2). Grammatical\nmetaphor acts in a similar way to lexical metaphor, except with lexicogrammar\n(structures of words) instead of words (Martin, 2007). In formal discourse, processes, qualities\nand logical relations are often instead realised as nouns, and logical relations realised\nas prepositional phrases, verbs and nouns – resulting in stratal tensions where there is a\nnon-matching between grammar and semantics (Martin, 2007). For example, in formal historical\ndiscourse a sentence might read ‘The ‘Commotion Time’ of 1549 [noun/processes]\nwas underpinned [verb/logical relation] by growing resentment to wage decreases [noun/\nqualities and processes]’. As a result of this tension, there is an ensuing mismatch between\nwhat the reader might typically expect (the ‘literal’) and the unexpected realisation of\nthese meanings (‘the metaphorical’) (Christie & Derewianka, 2008, pp. 24–25). The key derivation\nof this ‘grammatical metaphor’ is ‘nominalisation’ during which activities are recon-\nstructed as abstract things. This type of ‘thingification’ (Martin, 2007, pp. 44–45) involves\nreconstruing and distilling activities presented in a whole clause as an abstracted nominal\ngroup and, according to genre theorists, is a recurrent feature of technicalised historical\ndiscourse (Christie & Derewianka, 2008; Schleppegrell, 2011).\nAllied to this focus, in this view these nominalisations act upon one another in a similarly\nabstracted manner (Schleppegrell et al., 2004). For example, genre theorists have\nidentified older students’ tendency to bury ‘the cause within the clause’ (Martin, 2007, pp.\n45–46). Martin has suggested that historical discourse compared to, for example, science,\ngenerally avoids explicit conjunctions. Instead, causal relations in particular tend to be\nportrayed as prepositional phrases, nouns or verbs. Martin (2007) argues that this tendency\nenables ‘historians to fine tune causality’ and ‘enact finely differentiated types of\ncause and effect relations’. So, for example, a historian would rarely write that ‘Hitler\nbecame Chancellor because of the complacency of elite conservatives’ but might instead\nargue ‘The conservative elites’ complacency facilitated Hitler’s rise to the Chancellorship’.\nTHE CURRICULUM JOURNAL 513\n', ' \nqu\nal\nity\nlo\ngi\nca\nl r\nel\na\x02\non\npa\nr\x02\nci\npa\nnt\npr\noc\nes\ns\nqu\nal\nity\nlo\ngi\nca\nl r\nel\na\x02\non\npa\nr\x02\nci\npa\nnt\npr\noc\nes\ns\nLe\nxi\nco\ngr\nam\nm\nar\nse\nm\nan\n\x02c\ns\nad\nje\nc\x02\nve\nco\nnj\nun\nc\x02\non\nno\nun\nve\nrb\nad\nje\nc\x02\nve\nco\nnj\nun\nc\x02\non\nno\nun\nve\nrb\nW\nith\nou\nt ‘\ngr\nam\nm\na\x02\nca\nl m\net\nap\nho\nr’\nW\nith\n ‘g\nra\nm\nm\na\x02\nca\nl m\net\nap\nho\nr’\nFi\ngu\nre\n2.\nAb\nrid\nge\nd\nve\nrs\nio\nn\nof\nM\nar\ntin\n’s\n(2\n00\n7)\nsc\nhe\nm\na\nof\n‘g\nra\nm\nm\nat\nic\nal\nm\net\nap\nho\nr’.\n514 J. E. CARROLL\n', '‘Whereas conjunctions such as ‘because’ or ‘so’ are essentially neutral, the use of prepositional\nphrases, nouns, and verbs allows for simple inter-causal relationships to be ‘trans-\nformed into a finely nuanced clause-internal repertoire for interpretation as these\nresources are brought to bear’ (pp. 45–46).\nAlthough English history teachers and researchers have approached the issue from a\npredominantly disciplinary rather than lexicogrammatical perspective, the focus on this\ntype of abstraction is a pertinent example of convergent evolution between genre theory\nand the ‘extended writing movement’. First, the cognitive research of the educational\nresearchers Howson and Shemilt (2011), which has been influential in the ‘extended writing\nmovement’s’ discourse, has similarly noted that sophisticated historical argument\ntends to be driven by ‘colligatory generalisations’ (p. 73) such as the ‘Industrial Revolution,\n‘The First World War’ or the ‘Great Depression’. In this view, colligatory generalisations are\nencapsulating abstractions that package events under one umbrella term and thus allow\nthe thematic organisation of historical knowledge. Furthermore, these generalisations do\nnot have direct experiential referents and therefore cannot be explained by referring\nsolely to a concrete object, person or event. Similarly, in the English history teacher\nresearch tradition, Counsell (1997) likewise identified students’ difficulty in distinguishing\nbetween ‘big points’ (the abstracted generalisation that forms the point of argument in\neach paragraph) and ‘little points’ (supporting evidence that substantiates the overarching\npoint). Similar ideas have been proffered by Palek (2015) who has focused on the relationship\nbetween literacy and the construction of substantive abstractions and Fordham\n(2016) who has explored the necessarily interpretative nature of such abstractions.\nAlthough they present it largely as a disciplinary rather than linguistic issue, these two traditions\nwithin the discourse of the ‘extended writing movement’ bear striking similarity to\nthe genre theorists’ suggestion for more explicit focus on nominalisation. These separate\nidentifications of students’ difficulty in creating generalised abstractions indicate certain\ncommonalities that suggest at least some duplication of labour.\nSimilarly, echoing the genre theorists’ suggestion that historical discourse often ‘buries’\novert causal language, Lee and Shemilt (2009) have identified the tendency in historical\ndiscourse to bury the analytical ‘ductwork’ (pp. 42–49) of causal analysis. Equally, in the\nhistory teacher researcher tradition, there has been a trend starting with Woodcock (2005)\nin attempting to endow students with this type of causation-specific vocabulary to allow\nthe characterisation and prioritisation of causal factors. As with the case of nominalisation,\ndespite the clear scope for meaningful collaboration, there has been little attempt hitherto\nto combine the ‘extended writing movement’s’ focus on the disciplinary and the genre\ntheorists’ lexicogrammatical technology to support students’ arguments when constructing\ncomplex, nominalised abstractions and the causal relationships between them in his-\ntorical prose (Carroll, 2016a).\nA further salient example of this duplication of labour has been the two discourses’ similar\napproaches to making students alert to the ‘constructedness’ of historical texts, with\nthe intention that this type of analysis will make the argumentative nature of written historical\ndiscourse more explicit. The genre theorist Coffin (1996) recommended approaches\nto allow students to discern the grammatical means by which school history authors\n(especially textbook writers) ‘colour’ texts to position the reader to see an argument from\nthe writer’s viewpoint. By showing students these ‘colouring’ techniques, Coffin argues\nthat students will come to recognise school history textbooks as works of interpretation,\nTHE CURRICULUM JOURNAL 515\n', 'and will be less likely to accept such texts at face value. Coffin identified a number of ‘colouring\nstrategies’ that textbook writers adopt including tacitly expressing ideological per-\nspective by adopting language affect, judgement and evaluation; and using language\nthat effaces the writer as interpreter and submerges process of deduction (Unsworth,\n1999). Furthermore, Coffin recommended that students be made aware of how interpretation\nis obscured through nominalisation (when multiple events are repackaged as an\nabstracted noun). In this view, such nominalised generalisation (such as ‘period of lawlessness’\nas opposed to ‘period of resistance’) often means interpretations become naturalised\nas deceptively objective.\nIn some senses, history teachers in the ‘extended writing movement’ have developed\nstrikingly similar methods to attempt to alert students to the fact that all works of history\nare results of interpretation – representing a marked example of convergent evolution. For\nexample, a number of practising and former history teachers (e.g. Burnham & Brown,\n2009; Counsell, 2011b; Fordham, 2016) have advocated making children aware of how colligatory\ngeneralisations tread the penumbra between the substantive and the disciplinary\nand must therefore be deconstructed as historical interpretations. Similarly, history teachers\nhave also recommended students be taught to analyse history textbooks as historical\nconstructs (Edwards, 2008). Genre theorists and the ‘extended writing movement’ have\noccasionally – and independently – arrived at similar solutions (e.g. encouraging students\nto identify the interpretative quality of historical texts (e.g. Counsell, 2003)). This type of\nconvergent evolution has meant that opportunities have been missed to co-construct\nknowledge regarding extended historical writing and has resulted in a duplication of\nexceedingly similar ‘innovations’.\nSimilarly, genre theorists are concerned with empowering students with subject-specific\nlexis (Christie & Derewianka, 2008). Similarly, history teachers in the ‘extended writing\nmovement’ have focused on atomised vocabulary (e.g. causal connectives (Bakalis, 2003,\np. 22); superlatives and adjectives (Ward, 2006, p. 11); causal and temporal connectives\n(Counsell, 1997, p. 16); and verbs focused on causation (Woodcock, 2005, p. 9)). Within\nthis lexical focus, there has been further evidence of convergent evolution. For example,\nhistory teachers have advocated highlighting the inferential nature of discussing evidence\nthrough using distancing verbs such as ‘suggest’ (Carlisle, 2000; Counsell, 2004; Murray,\n2015; Smith, 2001; Wiltshire, 2000). This lexical focus is strikingly analogous to some genre\ntheorists’ suggestion that students be encouraged to adopt ‘showing processes’ such as\n‘suggest’ and ‘indicate’ (Christie & Derewianka, 2008, 120–122). Similarly, both history\nteacher-researchers (e.g. Counsell, 2004, p. 22) and genre theorists (e.g. Coffin, 2006) have\nadvocated using modal verbs to indicate to students the tentative nature of historical\nclaims. In terms of supporting students’ vocabulary then, there also appears to be evidence\nof wastage due to lack of communication between the two discourses.\nParallel/divergent evolution\nFinally, in some instances the two discourses have evolved in parallel or indeed veered\nfrom the other. This parallel and/or divergent evolution has manifested itself in a number\nof ways resulting in hitherto undetected – and therefore unresolved – tensions between\nthe two discourses. If left unsettled these discrepancies have the potential to ultimately\nresult in unresolvable disagreements and missed opportunities to marry the two\n516 J. E. CARROLL\n', "discourses as there will be little in terms of commonly shared constructions of knowledge\non which to hang the debates.\nWhat has largely distinguished genre theorists has been their advocacy of explicitly\nfocusing on teaching students how to construct meaning at a level that has hitherto been\ngenerally underexplored by the ‘extended writing movement’ (for an exception and possible\nnascent example convergent evolution see Foster, 2015) - by combining words\ntogether at the lexicogrammatical level of the sentence or clause (Christie & Derewianka,\n2008; Coffin, 2006; Donaghy, 2013; Martin, 2007; Schleppegrell, 2011). There is scope for\nthe ‘extended writing movement’ to build on the pre-existing knowledge of genre theory\nand consider how students may be made more alert to how historical meaning is constructed\nat the lexicogrammatical level (Carroll, 2016b).\nNot only have opportunities for fruitful collaboration been missed, the two discourses\nhave also in certain instances developed in directly antithetical ways. Due to the genre\ntheorists’ debt to Halliday, many are ‘utterly convinced’ (e.g. Donaghy, 2013, p. 35) that\nthe metalanguage of functional grammar should be used in classrooms. This is opposed\nto the discourse for discussing language used in formal, traditional grammar which currently\npredominates. The metalanguage of functional grammar seeks to emphasise how\nmeaning is made beyond the atomised level of the word. Genre theorists then, for example,\nadvocate substituting ‘verb’ with ‘process’; ‘subjects and objects’ with ‘participants’;\n‘topic sentence’ with ‘hypertheme; and ‘introduction’ with ‘macrotheme’ (Coffin, 2006,\np. 121; Donaghy, 2013, pp. 25, 30–32, 35–40). This elaborate metalanguage is so crucial to\nSFL pedagogy that ‘'Sydney School’ literacy programmes in fact involve doubling the\ninstructional discourse, since disciplines are factored as systems of genres (and thus of\nfield, tenor, mode constellations and of their realisation in language and attendant nonverbal\nmodalities of communication)’ (Martin, 2007, p. 56). Martin (2007) suggests that\nteachers, who are often not linguists by training, find the array of technicalisation associated\nwith SFL 'a shock’, and it is for this reason that they choose to forego adopting\ngenre-based pedagogies. Instead, in Martin’s view, teachers are content to prevaricate in\nadopting genre theory because ‘the new knowledge about language required costs time\nand therefore money, teachers are busy, and stratified learning outcomes are blamed on\nthe ability levels of individual students’ (p. 58). The development of this elaborate metalanguage,\nas conceded by genre theorists, has helped shape their cultural identity but has\nalso, unintentionally, served an exclusionary function (Becher, 1993). This technicalisation,\nhowever, is possibly not the only reason that practising history teachers have been slow\nto adopt genre theory. Not only has the language become highly technicalised, but it is\nalso increasingly redundant to the history teachers in England who have developed their\nown metalanguage which is more specifically designed to their requirements. Only once\ngenre theorists examine history teachers’ discourse and make a connection with it might\nsuch ultimately redundant avenues be avoided.\nA particularly instructive example of this divergent evolution is the recommendation\nfrom genre theory (e.g. Christie & Derewianka, 2008) of students ‘testing and evaluating’\nthe ‘reliability’, ‘truthfulness’ and ‘bias’ of historical sources (p. 89, 140–141). In order to\nexemplify a ‘benchmark’ (pp. 5–6) ‘well-developed text’ representative ‘of the most\ndemanding of the history genres’ (p. 139) Christie and Derewianka cited a student they\ncommended for identifying Paul Kennedy as ‘a ‘revisionist’ and the trustworthiness of his\nviews is evaluated positively through judgement of his capacity: ‘He is also a trained\nTHE CURRICULUM JOURNAL 517\n", "historian with a PhD from Oxford and a Professorship at Yale University’ which would render\nhis work ‘more accurate’ (p. 142). Similarly, Christie and Derewianka suggested the\nsame student commendably judged the historian Martin Gilbert as;\nhaving great expertise: ‘he is a distinguished historian who was a Fellow at Merton College\nOxford’. Because of his training in historical investigation, his views can be considered ‘reliable’.\nHowever, as a ‘Jew’ and an ‘expert on the Holocaust’ his account could be regarded as\n‘biased. (p. 144)\nBy contrast, in the ‘extended writing movement’, responses similar to this have not only\nbeen considered achievable for students of lower age groups – they have actually been\nconsidered reductive, imitative and fundamentally anti-historical. As Fordham (2014) suggested,\namong the published history teacher research community in England, pedagogies\nthat valorise this type of source analysis have been ‘criticised consistently, coherently and\nrelentlessly since Lang’s 1993 article ‘What is bias?’ First, Lang (1993) criticised the ‘fearless\nunmasking of bias’ (p. 9) a contrivance of examination mark schemes and history textbook\nauthors rather than academic historical discourse. As Lang (1993) noted such approaches\n‘misrepresent the nature of historical sources: all sources are biased, so it makes little\nsense to ask children to identify ones that are. They are, in other words, unhistorical questions,\nand it is unfair to throw them at children. Much the same holds good for questions\nabout the usefulness of sources’ (p. 13). Far from conceptualising examples such as the\none above as a curricular goal for her 11-year-old students Le Cocq (2000), expounding\non Lang, rejected her pupils’ similar responses as unsuitably reductive for the age group\nsuggesting ‘once pupils grasp the word ‘bias’ it so often becomes a hackneyed catch-all,\nblunting and limiting their evaluative work’ (p. 50). Similarly, Le Cocq wanted to ‘avoid the\nformulaic, low-level responses that are often parroted in response to any source deemed\n‘untrustworthy'’ (p. 51). In this view, the ascription of such value to responses which offer\nwhat is deemed to be seemingly trite, mechanical and non-evaluative responses to historiography\nby pedagogies such as genre theory is inappropriate. From this perspective, ped-\nagogies that adopt examination syllabuses and history textbooks as the arbiter and\nmodel of successful historical reasoning results in the proliferation of mark-schemederived\nsub-genres which substitute clich\x01ed imitation for historical reasoning as an aca-\ndemic historian would understand it. It would appear that if genre theorists wish to make\na more meaningful contribution to history teachers’ practice, then they need to be more\nreceptive to the trends currently driving the 'extended writing movement’. Without doing\nso, the recommendations of genre theorists may be deemed irrelevant to history teachers’\nneeds.\nRecommendations for future research\nDespite a widespread recognition by history education stakeholders of the need for disciplinary-specific\napproaches to students’ extended writing, small-scale successes have not\nbeen scaled up into widespread solutions. As a result, guidance and recommendations\nhave often been pluralistic to the point of contradiction. Rather than merely adding yet\nanother approach, a new direction in empirical research could uncover and exploit hitherto\nunexplored connections and continuities within this corpus. Adjoining discourses lay-\ning claim to the same pieces of ‘intellectual territory’ ‘does not necessarily entail a conflict\n518 J. E. CARROLL\n", 'between them’ but instead can ‘mark a growing unification of ideas and approaches’\n(Becher, 1993, p. 38). I recommend a more interventionist approach, seeking to move\nbeyond simply identifying opportunities for unification to actively breaking down increasingly\nformalised boundaries.\nFor example, I have attempted to identify some commonalities and incongruities\nbetween the two discourses of ‘genre theory’ and the ‘extended writing movement’. While\nthere have been some limited attempts by English history teachers to draw on genre theory,\nthis has largely been a one-way relationship. From both sides, inter-discursive com-\nmunication is necessary. This would potentially have a number of benefits in developing\nstudents’ historical writing. First, wastefully repetitive ‘discoveries’ of genre theory by\nEnglish history teachers and policy makers might be avoided. Second, history teachers’\nunwitting critiques and developments of genre theory may be clearly identified as such,\nallowing for both discourses to develop solutions in light of each other’s evaluations.\nThird, duplication of similar ‘innovations’ by both discourses in response to similar identifications\nof students’ difficulties might be avoided. Finally, genre theorists’ might avoid\nmaking further recommendations that are increasingly redundant for history teachers’\nneeds. Without attempts to redress this pluralism by resolving issues and developing a\ncontext where there is a closer alignment in terms of theories and methods of inquiry, systematic\nadvances in the knowledge regarding students’ extended historical writing, as has\nbeen evidenced, might be disallowed (Kuhn, 1970; cf. Becher, 1993).\nAcknowledgments\nMany thanks to my PhD supervisor Christine Counsell for her time, support, and guidance.
