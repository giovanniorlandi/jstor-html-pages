Its protection commonly \nentails practices of bordering through infrastructural control and service delivery, as \nwell as the policing of data circulation and user mobility. In a context characterized \nby profound territorial fragmentation, such as the Occupied Palestinian Territory \n(OPT),1 equating national cyberspace with national territory proves to be reductive. \nThis article explores how different cyber security strategies – implemented by the \nIsraeli government, the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas – intersect and produce \na cyberspace characterized by territorial annexation, occupation, and blockade. \nDrawing on this analysis, it then employs the conceptual prism of (de-)–(re-)\nterritorialization to reflect on how these strategies, as well as those of Palestinian \nhackers, articulate territoriality beyond the normativity of national cyberspace.\nKeywords:  \nnational cyberspace, cyber security, cyber warfare, securitization, Palestine\nIntroduction\nOverlooking the Israeli checkpoint in Qalandyia, a Palestinian village \nbetween Jerusalem and Ramallah in the West Bank, a graffiti dominates \nthe grey surface of the adjacent separation wall with the computer \ncommand ctrl+alt+del, written in giant capital letters.2 Typically used to \nterminate an unresponsive task, the light-blue painted keyboard shortcut \nfiguratively portraits the wall itself as a failed process that needs to be \nforcibly terminated. At the same time, the graffitied command also traces \na continuity between spatial and cyber closures for Palestinians.\n,  p p .  2 8 – 4 2\n', '29\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\nNational cyber security policies, as well as offensive and defensive cyber \nwarfare, are commonly inspired by a similar perceived continuity: the spatial \ncorrespondence between national territory and sovereignty in cyberspace. \nAssigning traditional territorial qualities to cyberspace, national authorities \nenvision its protection through physical bordering and different approaches \nto the ordering of mobilities for both data and users.3 Regulating extent \nand modes of data circulation and user mobility, cyber security purports to \norder and secure the national cyberspace on the basis of its congruence with \na country’s territory.4\nFor its territorial fragmentation and diverse regimes regulating mobility, \nthe case of the Occupied Palestinian Territory offers a unique perspective \nto reflect on the territorial qualities of cyberspace and its securitization. \nOn one hand, territorial sovereignty represents, in fact, the ultimate \nraison d’être of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict; on the other, multiple \nand shifting regimes of mobility compile the complex grammar of the \ndistributed system of control over the biopolitical life of the Palestinians. \nThese regimes constitute the result of different degrees of Israeli territorial \ncontrol: annexation of East Jerusalem, occupation of the West Bank, and \nblockade of the Gaza Strip.\nThis article explores how Israeli and Palestinian strategies intersect, enact, \nand disrupt territorial control over cyberspace, and whether these are \nconsistent with the current fragmentation of the Palestinian territory. \nWhereas Israel’s absolute control over infrastructural networks configures \nforemost as a direct practice of territorial bordering, recent legislations \nof the Palestinian Authority (PA) operate on territoriality in less direct \nforms. Imposing severe limitations on user mobility and data circulation, \nthese measures ultimately replicate PA’s security cooperation with Israel \nalso in cyberspace. \nFurthermore, this article advances a critique of a “static” territorial \nunderstanding of sovereignty in cyberspace through the analysis of \noffensive operations conducted by Palestinian hackers. Inspired by \ntheoretical works on (de-)–(re-)territorialization (Deleuze and Guattari \n', '30\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\n1988; Deleuze and Guattari 2000; Foucault 2007), the analysis of these \nhacking operations further indicates how the territorial articulation of \ncyberspace does not linearly stem from national sovereignty. Rather, \nit encompasses different relational moments of becoming sovereign: \nwhereas de-territorialization pertains to the moment in which established \nnorms are disarticulated, re-territorialization refers to redo the undone \n(Petersen 2014; Waldenfels 2004).\nIn this light, Palestinian hacking operations can be understood as moments \nof “becoming sovereign” through (de-)–(re-)territorialization to the same \nextent of national policies and strategies. Furthermore, the lack of univocal \nspatial boundaries in cyberspace – and a necessarily distributed approach \nto security – empowers Palestinian hackers to overcome the technological \nobsolescence imposed on them through creative forms of social engineering \nand manipulation (Bullée et al. 2018) As these define the territoriality of \ncyberspace as a function of how users and data move, this article ultimately \ninterrogates the normative assumption that a national cyberspace reproduces \ntout court its corresponding national territory.\nNational cyberspace and national territory \nIn contrast with cyber-utopianist visions of a borderless Internet, national \nsecurity and defense policies contributed to the current disintegration \nand fragmentation of cyberspace into national subdivisions (Mueller \n2017; Mueller 2010; Morozov 2011). These “compartments” are thought \nto possess spatial and territorial characteristics that are equivalent to \nthose of a sovereign country (Wu 1997; Mueller 2002). In classical realist \nterms, a delimited, continuous, and internationally recognized territory \nconstitutes, in fact, an essential element to define national sovereignty. It is \nthus primarily through physical bordering that a space becomes a territory. \nBesides legislative implications, the bordering of a specific space creates \ntwo different spatial realities: an inside and an outside.5 In addition to \nfulfilling a spatial function, the delimitation of a territory operates then \nthrough a normative logic of inclusion–exclusion, peculiar to the ordering \nfunction that a territory plays in relation to identity. \n', '31\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\nAt a basic level, national authorities enact the territorial delimitation of \ntheir national cyberspace through control over infrastructural elements \nof the network: the backbone, fiber cables, servers, switches, et cetera \n(DeNardis and Musiani 2016). National control over the backbone – also \nreferred to as “core network” – constitutes the primary feature that sets \nforth national sovereignty in cyberspace. This public core (Broeders 2015) \ncomprises a series of principal data routes and computer networks that, \ngathered and administered by a central authority, determine control of the \nphysical components of the Internet network, and thus its fundamental \nterritoriality. At the same time, with responsibilities for the security of \ncyberspace distributed to a variety of actors other than the state,6 local \nnodes and ramifications constitute the ultimate terrains where territoriality, \nand thus sovereignty, unfold (Broeders 2017).\nIn contravention of Art.36/3 of Oslo II (1995) – that unambiguously declares \nthe PA’s right to infrastructural autonomy – Israeli authorities currently \ncontrol the Internet backbone and the infrastructural network for the entire \n1948 territory (AbuShanab 2019). From an infrastructural perspective, Israel’s \nabsolute control of the “bare metal” elements of cyberspace in fact exceeds its \nlegitimate territorial boundaries, and thus reproduces the illegal territorialities \nof annexation, occupation, and blockade over the Palestinian territory.\nIn 1967, in the aftermath of the Six-Day War, Israel annexed Palestinian \nareas east of the armistice line (the Green Line). Advancing this annexation \nthrough concrete bordering, in the early 2000s, the Israeli government put \n“facts on the ground” by erecting the contested separation wall. Deviating \nits path from the internationally-recognized border (the Green Line), the \nwall concretely annexes East Jerusalem, thus detaching the designated \nPalestinian capital from the West Bank. The territorial annexation of East \nJerusalem also pertains to cyberspace. Besides controlling the Internet \nbackbone, the Israeli annexation unfolds through the denial of service \nprovision, with a ban outlawing Palestinian Internet service providers \n(ISPs) and mobile carriers from delivering and commercializing Internet \nservice in the city (AbuShanab 2018). Operating through an archetypal \nlogic of exceptionalism7 – that is the sovereign suspension of agreed norms \n', '32\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\nand political freedoms – Israeli policies ultimately purport to detach the \nPalestinian city also from its national cyberspace. \nWhereas cyberspace in East Jerusalem undergoes complete annexation – \nin line with the Zionist imaginary of a unified Jewish city 8 – the Israeli \noccupation of the West Bank translates into cyberspace through less direct \nforms of territorial control. The PA holds, in fact, the responsibility for \nInternet governance and service provision across the Palestinian areas of \nthe West Bank. However, the Israeli absolute control of the infrastructure \nmeans that Palestinian ISPs depend on their Israeli homologs to supply \na second-hand, and expensive, Internet connection across the territory. \nA 2016 World Bank report indicates that, besides detaining full control \non the core network, Israeli authorities regularly block the import of ICT \nequipment and technologies towards the Palestinian controlled areas of the \nWest Bank (AbuShanab 2019). At the very least, one should ask whether \nnational sovereignty in cyberspace can ever be attained in the absence of \ninfrastructural autonomy.\nWith Oslo I (1993) granting Israel jurisdiction over Area C (presently ca 61 \npercent of the West Bank), Palestinian Internet operators require multiple \nauthorizations for transporting or installing technologies in the area. Citing \nsecurity concerns, the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA) regularly turns \nthem down, while Israeli providers supply Internet connection and mobile \nservices to illegal Jewish settlements in Area C. As settler presence in the \nWest Bank has quadrupled since 1993 (EEAS 2019) – despite several peace \nagreements establishing an official freeze on their expansion – Israeli ISPs \nimproved and expanded the infrastructural network needed to serve the \ngrowing settler community (across the West Bank and East Jerusalem). \nDue to this, Palestinians in Area C need to roam on Israeli frequencies to \naccess mobile Internet, commonly opting to subscribe to one of the Israeli \noperators (Niksic et al. 2014). \nIn absence of absolute control over service provision, the Israeli occupation \ntranslates in cyberspace through measures of less concrete and direct \nbordering. Whereas the annexation of East Jerusalem in cyberspace marks \n', '33\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\na continuity with the erection of the separation wall, the occupation of \ncyberspace in the West Bank hinders service delivery in ways that are \nreminiscent of Israeli roadblocks, (flying) checkpoints, and its Kafkaesque \npermit system (Berda 2017). \nInternet governance in the Gaza Strip functions through a setup similar to \nthe one in the West Bank. Relying on the Israeli core network, Palestinian \nISPs deliver a secondhand service across the Hamas-governed territory \n(Tawil-Souri 2012). Since 2006, however, following Hamas’ success in the \nPalestinian elections, Israel has imposed a territorial blockade on the Gaza \nStrip.  The Israeli illegal blockade severely limits the mobility of goods \nand people, thus further isolating the area from the rest of the Palestinian \nterritory (Erakat 2012). As a result, Gaza currently relies on Israel even \nfor the provision of basic services such as electricity, water, and sewage \ntreatment (World Bank 2019). Likewise, Israeli authorities control the \nentire telecommunication system, including wired and wireless Internet. \nFor this reason, Palestinian ISPs need permits to access the Gaza Strip \nin order to perform infrastructural maintenance, but these are regularly \nturned down (Abou Jalal 2017). Furthermore, Israeli bombardments on \nICTs, as well as regular power cuts, further compromise the infrastructure \nand service delivery (Weinthal and Sowers 2019). As territorial blockade \nextends to bandwidth, spectrum, and frequency allocation, Israeli measures \nforce Gaza into a state of technological obsolescence and dependency. \nThrough infrastructural control and cyber security, Israel upholds territorial \nsovereignty over Gaza’s seized cyberspace.9\nCyber security as territorial bordering\nIsrael currently organizes its national cyber security in the light of \na centralized governance model. Since 2017, a single unit – the National Cyber \nDirectorate (NCD) – holds responsibility for the protection of both civilian \nand military nodes of the national cyberspace, thus conflating security and \ndefense strategies. Besides infrastructural control and cyber defense, the Israeli \nterritorial control over Palestinian cyberspace heavily relies on cyber security \nmeasures that are conventionally enforced in domestic contexts.\n', '34\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\nIn addition to traditional cyber espionage, Israeli security forces recur to \nthe algorithmic parsing of Palestinian online content as part of predictive \npolicing and pre-crimes. This flagging primarily focuses on social media, \nwherein the automatic scanning examines contents to detect data of alleged \nsecurity relevance (Cristiano 2018). Evidence indicates that – besides a pool \nof blacklisted Arabic words such as freedom, martyr, Al Aqsa, et cetera – \nthe algorithms intercept status updates and content flagged solely for their \npolitical connotation and indicating no warning of violence of any kind \n(AbuShanab 2018). These measures target Palestinians across the 1948 \nterritory as well the international diaspora, thus superseding any rationale \nof national and territorial sovereignty.  \nThe PA and Hamas enforce cyber security strategies that further hinder \nmobility in cyberspace for the Palestinians. In 2018, the PA approved a \ncontroversial cybercrime law: operating through two focal aspects – content \nmanagement and access regulation – this legislation purports to protect \n“national unity” and “social harmony” (Article 51) across its national \ncyberspace. In practice, it urges Palestinian ISPs and hosting services to \ntake down those websites, blogs, and online content that PA and its security \nagencies flag as a threat to national security or values (Abdeen 2018). Citing \nconcerns to national security, the legislation also outlaws connection via \nalternative routes (Article 31) such as VPNs, mesh networking, I2P, and \nthe like. Banning these methods reenacts Israeli territorial control as it \npurports to constrain traffic along the occupied national network. In other \nwords, outlawing alternative routes ultimately reterritorializes potential \nPalestinian “escapes” into a preserved spatial status quo (Arafeh et al. 2015). \nConversely, Hamas government retains marginal power over its national \ncyberspace. The absence of locally-controlled infrastructures and service \nprovision severely hinders Gaza’s ability to develop its own strategy of \ncyber security. In 2012, Hamas tried in vain to regain sovereignty over its \ncyberspace by introducing a ban on the use of Israeli connection services. \nWith little or no authority over infrastructure and service delivery, Hamas’ \ncyber security unfolds by tightening control over endusers and local nodes \nof the network. Its security forces employ in fact extensive surveillance to \n', '35\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\nmotivate the arrest and prosecution of political opponents or dissidents \n(AbuShanab 2019). These same techniques are used for policing compliance \nto Islamic precepts: having enforced a ban on “immoral websites”, security \nforces regularly raid Internet cafes to monitor how users roam online \n(AbuShanab 2019).\nHacking as (de-)–(re-)territorialization\nThe previous sections illustrate how different cyber security strategies \nfunction as devices of territorialization for (fragments of) Palestinian \ncyberspace and corroborate evidence of a strong correspondence between \nnational cyberspace and national territory. While operating in a context \ndefined by territorial sovereignty, these national strategies construct and \nreinforce territorial ordering in cyberspace on their own. In this sense, \ncyber security articulates and orders the boundaries of sovereignty through \nthe creation of an outside “other”.\nPalestinian hackers – autonomous or operating as a cyber wing for a political \nfaction (Hamas, PFLP, Jihadists, etc.) – participate in this articulation of \nsovereignty through offensive techniques, targeting Israeli cyberspace on \nboth its military and civilian nodes. These include both intrusive strategies \nfor gathering intelligence (spear-phishing, spyware, ransomware, etc.) as \nwell as disruptive ones (distributed denial-of-service attacks, takedowns, \nredirects, defacements, etc.) (Rudner 2013). Whereas these attacks \nintensify in concomitance with violent escalations, they constitute an \nimmanent feature of regional cyber warfare; despite vastly asymmetric \ncyber potentials in Israel–Palestine, these campaigns have proved a great \nasset for Palestinian groups. \nThese operations commonly feature somewhat unsophisticated coding, \nbut advanced social hacking techniques, thus crediting their success \nto well-designed baits tricking Israeli users into allowing passage for \nmalicious contents. Context-tailored emails, deceitful apps (gaming, \ndating, news, etc.) and fake social media links specifically target military \nand governmental personnel (IDF 2017). In 2018, Palestinian hackers \n', '36\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\nimplanted a spyware into an app mimicking the Red Alert, a service \nthat warns Israeli users in the event of imminent rocket attacks from \nGaza. This technique exploited the logic of ubiquitous securitization: \nattacking through a software that warns about attacks (ClearSky 2018).\nBesides low-tech hacking, Palestinian cyber operations have at times \nshown unanticipated levels of sophistication and effectiveness, in spite of \nthe obsolete infrastructures across the territory. In 2013, for example, the \ncyber wing of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (IADAQ ) took control \nof a series of Israeli websites and servers through a technique of direct deterritorialization.\nWhereas not unique in terms of outcomes – as thousands \nof Israeli websites have been taken down or defaced by Palestinians in \nthe last fifteen years – this operation appeared at the time unique for \nthe sophisticated design of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS).10 \nPalestinian hackers coded a programming language that, operating on the \ncontrolled zombie-network, allowed them to access a larger bandwidth \nneeded for carrying out the attack. Through the manipulation of codes, \nhackers successfully expanded the bandwidth available to them. \nOn other occasions, Palestinian hackers combine complex operations \nwith the aforementioned social hacking techniques. One of Israel’s basic \ncyber security provisions consists of blocking the mobility of all data \ncoming from the Gaza Strip in order to prevent them from reaching its \nnetwork endpoints (AbuShanab 2019). In these conditions, the success \nof cyberattacks launched from Gaza primarily depends on the ability to \ncircumvent this territorial block. In 2015, Gaza-based hackers launched \na massive spear-phishing attack on Israeli cyberspace: bypassing the \nblockade, the operation compromised and accessed databases belonging \nto public offices, military departments, private companies, and individual \nusers (Trend Micro Threat Research Team 2015). Palestinian hackers \nleveraged these attacks – referred to as Operation Arid Viper – on servers \nbased in Germany. Through this expedient, the Israeli cyber dome failed \nto detect them as originating from Gaza and thus approved their passage. \nOn the other hand, the attack employed diverse bait contents for different \ntargets, in line with one of the social hacking precepts: vulnerability resides \n', '37\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\nin users’ behavior and choices, to a degree uncontrollable for national cyber \nsecurity and its normative understanding of sovereignty.\nConclusions\nIn August 2017, a 64-year-old Palestinian man, resident of Isawiya in East \nJerusalem, recounted to me his frustration over a recent economic loss. \nA few days earlier, a cyberattack had irremediably compromised his \ncompany website and databases. Together with the message “Freedom to \nPalestine”, the defacing image of an armed cyborg holding a Palestinian \nflag was now peeping out the homepage of his family business website. \nA historical advocate of the Palestinian cause, and member of the \nPalestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), had himself fallen victim of \nhackers targeting Israeli cyberspace in solidarity with Palestine.  \nThese hackers apparently acted on the common creed that domain names \nare a sufficient indication of territorial identification: attacking websites \nhosted on the domain .il would equate to attacking Israel. In general terms, \ncountry code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are indeed reserved for sovereign \npolities and formally extend the boundaries of national jurisdictions to \ncyberspace (Mueller and Badiei 2017). Together with national control on \ncore networks, this conventional arrangement marks a linear continuity \nbetween national cyberspace and national territory. As argued throughout \nthis article, the complex spatial realities across the Palestinian territory \ndemonstrate the issues associated with this assumption. \nAbove all, the architecture of cyberspace assigns extensive control functions \nto its network nodes (van den Berg and Keymolen 2017). Unique to this \narchitectural structure, the resilience of the system allows for the rerouting \nof data traffic through alternative routes in case of closure (Ruiz and Barnett \n2015). Network nodes are thus part of how territories are articulated in \ncyberspace in ways that are independent of a static correspondence with the \nnational territory. Besides infrastructural control, this article has argued \nthat (de)–(re)territorialization in cyberspace occurs primarily through the \nordering, and disordering, of data circulation and user mobility. \n', '38\nFa\nbi\no C\nris\ntia\nno\nyber C y b e r O r i e n t ,  Vo l .  1 3 ,  I s s .  1 ,  2 0 1 9\nIsraeli and Palestinian national cyber security strategies, as well as hacking \noperations, operate in fact in light of a spatial imaginary that, while being \nconsistent to respective national imaginaries, moves away from (legitimate) \nterritorial sovereignty. By articulating an exception, this very estrangement \ncreates a sovereign space. In these terms, cyber security strategies (or the \nhacking thereof) can do more than enacting a preimagined territory: they \ncan create a new one.\nReferences\nAbdeen, Isam. 2018.

On this topic, see Cohen (2007). Of course, countries regularly recur to \noffensive cyber operations targeting foreign infrastructures or users. When attributed, these \nare however commonly framed in terms of national security and preventive strategies.\n4 User mobility refers, in this article, to different forms of users’ movement in cyberspace: \naccess, handover, roaming, et cetera.\n5 On the concept of “territoriality rule” in cyberspace, please see Kostopoulos (2012).\n6 These include security contractors, commercial cyber security, service providers, as well \nthe individual choices of users who, in this particular context, hold unique shares of \nresponsibility.\n7 As theorized by Agamben in the State of Exception (2005).\n8 This territorial imaginary is also reinforced within interactive digital spaces, such as \naugmented-reality gaming (see Cristiano and Distretti 2017).\n9 This argument also provides the rationale for Israeli monitoring of parts of the Palestinian \ncyberspace that fall outside perceived territorial boundaries: Internet cafes in Jordan or \nLebanon, but also pro-Palestinian international blogs and websites. In other words, the \nIsraeli security apparatus operates on those spaces that are envisioned to be Palestinian \nregardless of their territorial configuration.\n10 These consist in taking control over a large number of unsuspecting computers (known in \njargon as “zombies”). Joining these together into a robot network (the botnet), hackers use \nzombies to flood targeted websites with access requests until they collapse.\n']</pre>
