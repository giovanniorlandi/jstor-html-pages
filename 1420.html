The\npractical economic value of trees\nalong the roadside is beyond dispute.\nThev actually protect the\nroad and lessen the cost of keep.\nWhat they add to the money value\nof abutting farms it wculd be\ndifficult to estimate, but if, of\ntwo farms, otherswise exactly\nequal in value and offered at the\ngame price, one is fringed by\nshade trees and the other is bare.\nthere is little doubt which nine\nbuyers out of ten would prefer.\nIn no other way can the attractions\nof a bit of country road be\nso much enhanced. Who that\ndrives in the conutry does\'nt\nfeel grateful to the farmer whose\ntrees beautify the scene? Planting\nshade trees where none exist\nis not really expensive, and\nin the long run it pays quite as\nwell, at least, as planting wheat.\nThere are, of coarse, certain\npractical Tproblems, such as\navoiding too dense a shade upon\ngrain land and selecting the\nstock; but a treeless road anywhere\noutside the desert is a reproach\nto those who live upon it.\nFor Sale.\nA feed work horse at a bargain\nif taken at once.\nS, M.

VAX SMITH.)\nFow people realize tho Importune\nof handling apples with car whl!\npicking, packing and markeUng. Apples\narc bruised very easily, and especially\nthoso varieties having a tender\nflesh or skin. Bruises mean not\nonly an unattractive appearance, but\na real waste of fruit by having to\ncut out th bruised tissue. Probably\nthe greatest damage from bruises,\nhowever, results from tho fact that\ntho bruises furnish an entrance for\nfungus or rot spores. Theso Bpores,\nor "fungus seeds," are as flno as\ndust and float in the air. If they\nhappon to lodge on a bruised or\nbroken spot on the apple, they take\nroot and grow and spread through\ntho apple, causing It to rot. Wrapping\nor covering the apple may not\nalways protect It, as tho spores may\nhave lodged on the apple before It\nwas picked. However, If tho skin\nand flcBh of the apple can be kept\nIntact and not bruised or broken,\nthero Is not much danger of tho fungus\nor rot finding ltfl way Into the\napple.\nTo prevent bruising, apples Bhould\nnot be dropped or thrown Into a\nbucket, box, or barrel, and In pouring\nfrom ono vessel to another care\nshould bo taken that tho apples are\nas close as possible to the bottom\nof tho vessel In which you are placing\ntbem before the Dourlng begins.\nA Cfliiqti, A Colli\nAnd then no telling what unless you\nuse Dr. Hell\'s Fine Tar-Honey, it is\nthe best, a-k vour neighbor.
