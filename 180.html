Steese Returns, From Orient Cruise, With Govt. Officials, A passenger on the Evans from Ju, neau last night was Major Gotwals, of the Alaska Road Commission., Major Gotwall has just come from, a meeting with Colonel Steese, who ar, rived in Juneau on the 25th, after his, trip to the Orient on the Mojave with, Assistant Secretary Huston, of the De, partment of Commerce, and his party., Major Gotwall reports that Colonel, Steese and the government party had, an intensely interesting voyage, cruis, ing around Bering Sea, visiting at, Nome and the Pribilof Islands before, proceeding to the Siberian coast. At, St. Paul’s Island, in the Pribilof group,, the government officials found the, seal industry thriving, in marked con, trast to that on the Russian and Jap, anese islands, where the herds are, being rapidly exterminated. With the, government party was Prof. Steneger,, the famous authority on seals, who is, acting as a consulting specialist for, the government, and upon whose re, port the Department of Commerce will, rely for advice in the future conduct, of the Industry. One of the little ap, preciated developments on the Pribilof, Islands, Colonel Steese reports, is the, growth of the fox industry. The foxes, are fed on the carcases of the seals, killed each year for their skins, and, the little animals have increased at, a surprising rate. Fox furs to the, value of half a million dollars have, been prodduced on the islands., From the Alaska coast the Mojave, cruised across to Siberia. Here pe, culiar political situations exist, ac, cording to Colonel Steese, three “Re, publics” being installed at successive, intervals from the coast toward the, interior. Along the seaboard is the, “White” Republic; immediately be, yond the outposts of the “White” re, public is the “Pink” republic, whose, far-flung line extends to Lake Baikal., There the color intensifying, it be, comes gradually more and more “Red”, until the heart of the Bolshevik! do, main at Moscow is reached. Colonel, Steese reports that there are quite a, number of Americans in Kamchatka,, engaged in placer mining, while along, the coast American traders are nu, merous., Colonel Steese left the Mojave at, Petropavlosk, on the Kamchatka, Peninsula, from where he embarked, on a small boat for Hakodate, Japan., At Hakodate Colonel Steese took a, train through Japan to Yokohama,, whence he returned to the United, States by way of an ocean liner, arriv, ing in Seattle on the 21st of Septem, ber. The remainder of the party, con, tinuing on the Mojave, proceeded to, Manila, thence to Shanghai, from, where the last leg of the cruise around, the world will be made by crossing to, Panama, through the Canal and north, to Newport News. In her voyage, across the Pacific and along the Ori, ental coast the Mojave has met with, some severe storms and a few excit, ing adventures, said Colonel Steese,, none of them, however, proving, serious., Colonel Steese will remain in Ju, neau, in the interests of the Road Com, mission, for some time.

Britain’s recession from, the neutral zone has caused consid, erable surprise and disapopintment, here, though it is admitted that it, was only a step to stay the Kemalist’s, hand. The move is pointed to as an, other conclusive evidence of Great, Britain’s desire if possible to avoid, war.

S. PAYS MUCH, MONEY FOR, NEWS PRINT, The annual cut in the United States, is more than three times the annual, growth since conservation and scien, tific forestry are practiced only in a, limited way. The United States is the, largest consumer of news print in the, world and since 1910 it has been a net, importer of news print. News print, consumption in 1913 was somewhat, less than 1,500,000 tons, and in 1921, it approximated 2,000,000 tons. In, 1522, production of paws print in the, United States wilt bn about 1,400,000, tons., Canada is by far the principal source, of supply of news print not manufac, tured in the United States. American, capital has gone extensively Into the, development of news print plants neai*, the sources of supplies of pulp wood in, Canada. The rapid expansion of the, Industry in Canada has facilitated the, installation there of improved hydro, electric machinery, capable of turning, out 1,000 feet of news print per min, ute. Such improved equipment ren, ders obsolete many of the older and, less efficient plants in the United, States, which can he operated profit, ably only when there is a strong de, mand for news print. Prior to the, war imports of news print from Can, ada averaged about 133.000 tons. By, 1520 they increased to 679,000 tons, and in 1921 totaled 657,000 tons., The development of the wood pulp, and news print industry in North, America, which now produces mor», news print than all the rest of the, world, has bebn on an immense sea’, and perhaps with more regard for ini, tnedite demands than for healthy fu, ture growth. In consequence of the, partial exhaustion of raw material, the industry in the United States has, for some years, been practically sta, tionary, while in Canada abundant, timber resources have facilitated, rapid development. In both count, tries, the industry in the past has de, veloped on the exploitation of virgin, resources. For its establishment on a, more permanent basis in the future,, a policy of conservation would seem, to be necessary., WELFARE BUREAU, IS BENEFIT TO, POSTAL SERVICE, WASHINGTON, Sept. 30.—A nation, wide organization was launched a lit, tle over a year ago, the membership, of which could be counted on the, fingers of an armless man., Today this organization, the Wel, fare Bureau of the Post Office Depart, ment, boasts of a membership ex, ceeding 125,000 persons and it is s?, growing., The idea for such a bureau was con, ceived by officials of the Post Office, Department when they were seeking, methods for improving conditions hi, the post office throughout the country, and bettering the working relations, of postal employes. It was decided, to have representative councils in th ’, various, post offices., Since the inception of the idea there, have sprung up in post offices 89G, councils. There are three kinds of, councils—local councils in first and, second-class post offices, central coun, cils and county councils. County, councils take in members of the staffs, of third and fourth class post offices, and rural free delivery carriers., Of the first-class offices 431 have, welfare councils and there are 2.15, second-class offices organized. There, are twenty central councils. Further, reports of organization of employes, are being received by officials daily., Post Office Department, officials, are unanimous in declaring that the, new councils have been an imporant, feature of the postal service. They, tiave co-operated with the postmasters, in suggesting improvements in the, service and they have suggested im, provements in working conditions of, the employes in the many offices., IMPORTANT BRITISH PICTURES, BOUGHT FOR NEW YORK, LONDON, Oct. 2.—Two more im, jortant British pictures shortly are, to be sent to America. One is the, famous Raeburn portrait of Sir Wal, ter Scott, and the, other is Gainsbor, ough\'s portrait of Mrs. Fitzherbert,, wife of the Prince Regent. Both have, been bought by a New York collector., Send the Dally Times to your, friends outside., SHIP PLANT, SCRAPPED BY, GOVEMENT, PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 2.—Hog Is, land, where rose the shipbuilding, industry during the war that gave, the United States renewed prestige, in the maritime world, soon will be, the flat field it was before Uncle, Sam invested $270,000,000 there,, i Hut the 946 acres will be habitable,, j as sanitary engineers have made it, so., Where once an army of 36,000 men, were building high-class vessels at, record-breaking speed, there now is, a detail of 50 men armed with oxy, acetylene torches and other instru, ments with which the demolition of, dismantling the mammoth machinery, pf war is progressing at a rapid, pace., The government\'s attempt to dis, pose of the plant by auction having, brought only low bids, it was de, cided to sell it piece-meal. Ponder, ous as is much of the equipment, the, government’s investment at Hog Is, land represents nearly everything, that man requires. In words of J. T., Eason, the government\'s agent in, charge of the sale, "everything ex, cept the airplanes, pianos and oil, paintings." Nearly every day auc, tion sales are held to dispose of, things ranging from household fur, niture to steel in 100,000 ton lots. It, is estimated that by the time the, sale closes December 1, $25,000,000, will have been realized on steel and, equipment alone. One of the recent, large purchases made at the yard, w’as by a New York steel brokerage, house which brought 105,000 tons of, steel., Twenty-five of the 50 huge ways,, representing high engineering skill,, are already down, and the general, appearance of the yard today is that, of a tornado-swept place. It is ex, pected that some large manufactur, ing or storage plant will be erected, on Hog Island after the government, has cleared it off., WORKERS CONCENTRATE, INLARG FACTORIES, Increasing concentration of wage, earners in large manufacturing, J plants is shown by the latest census, I figures which have recently become, | available, according to the September, issue of Commerce Monthly, the maga, zine of the National Bank of Com, merce in New York. Over a fourth, of the wage earners in 1919 were em, ployed in 1.021 factories employing, over 1,000 each. In 1914 less than a, fifth were working in such factories,, which then numbered only 64S. There, was a gain during the five years of 5S, per cent in the number of large plants, and of 91 per cent in the wage earn, ers employed by them., MANY VOTERS HAVE, OUTSIDE ADDRESSES, TACOMA, Oct. 2.—Preparation for, the general election in November, has disclosed the fact- that nanv, voters in Washington have their, post-office address in other states., Residents of Grouse precinct.

She, declares that the Korean scholars are, profound students of the American dic, tionary and. in an effort to express, themselves, use words of many syl, lables., The letter, containing many word", found in Webster’s volume and some, of the writer’s own coinage, is as fol, lows:, “It is with faltering penmanship, that I comunicate with you about a, prospective proposal to your household, girl, Sarah. From remote time past, secret passion has been firing my, bosom internally with your loving girl., Sarah., “1 have traveled all channels in the, magnitude of my extensive jurisdiction, cruelly to smother the growing love, knot that is being constructed within, my inside. But the timid lamp of my, affection, trimmed by Cupid\'s produc, tive hands, still nourishes my lovesick, breast. Needless would it be for me, to numerically extemporize the great, conflagration that has generated in, my heart and head., “During the reign of nightness my, intellectual cranium has been entan, gled in thoughtful attitude of my be, loved consort. Nocturnal slumberless, ness has been the infirmity which has, besieged my now loving begenerated, condition., “My educational abilities have, abandoned, and now I cling to these, lonely stresses of your much-coveted, girl like a mariner ship-wrecked on, the rocks of love., “I am of lofty and original lineage, and independent income, and hoping, that, having debated the proposition, in your girl’s mind, you will concur, daintily corroborated in espousing, Sarah praying to my tender bosom and, thereby acquiring me into your friend, ship circle.”, Mrs. Flynn stated she gave her, consent and that Sarah and John, Ah Sing are living in a Korean “love, cottage.”, GOLD STAR TABLET, WILL ADORN TREE, AS WAR MEMORIAL, SALEM, Ore., Oct. 2.—A gold star, on which will be engraved the names, of all Marion county men and women, who lost their lives in the service of, their country during the World War, will be placed on a redwood tree here,, according to a decision reached by, the Salem chapter of the American, war mothers., The number of men and women, whose names will be engraved on the, memorial is not accurately known as, yet, according to Mrs. J. A. Carson,, president of the war mothers. How, ever, a complete check of all veterans, entitled to the recognition, will be, made so that the memorial will serve, as a complete record of all those who, made the supreme sacrifice., The redwood tree will be surround, ed by an iron fence and the gold star, tablet will be illuminated at night,, Mrs. Carson added. All branches of, the service will be included in the me, morial, Mrs. Carson said., The tree on which the memorial, will be placecd has been the center, of much interest here for the past, few weeks. About a month ago the, city council voted that the tree, which, is in Sumner street, should be cut, down so as to not endanger traffic., Many local residents were opposed, to seeing the tree go, as it has a num, ber of historical association to Salem., A petition has been circulated asking, the council to rescind its action, and, A. N. Bush, of this city, has offered, to furnish all materials necessary for, having the tree lighted and to arrange, for suitable protection for traffic., • Try Dally Times for Job Printing., AGED PIONEER, ON NEW TRIP, WITH AUTO, WALLA WALLA, Sept. .30.—An old, man. hoary of head yet clear of eye,, and clean and healthful of complexion, despite his ninety-one years, is headed, eastward on his twenty-second trip, across the United States.

Oct. 2.—A new trans, lation of the Bible, including only the, books which, in the opinion of Sweden, borg, have an inner or symbolic mean, ing, will be undertaken at once by the, New Church (Swedenborgian) under, authority of a resolution adopted by, the Church convention here., The work, which has been in con, templation for more than forty years,, is made possible by the donation of, sufficient funds by George Marchant., a wealthy member of the sect, who re, sides in Brisbane, Australia., The task will require from five to, six years to complete, and its total, cost is estimated at $50,000 or more., “We intend to produce a slightly, more accurate and scientific transla, tion of the Bible, with all the aid, which modern research can give," said, Rev. William L. Worcester, president, of the convention, in explaining the, plan., “The present Bible, while a very, sincere and accurate translation, con, tains a number of words which were, used because of literary style and, which are not accurate synonyms of, the original words.", PRINCESS WINS HEARTS, YORKSHIRE HOUSEWIVES, WITH DOMESTIC S L, LONDON, Sept. 30.---Princess Mary, is making an excellent housewife., That is what they are saying up in, Yorkshire, where the Princess and her, Viscount husband have been spend, ing the late summer weeks. York, shire standards are very high. too., The Princess has won the hearts of all, of the Yorkshire country people and, is most popular in the villages sur, rounding her country home. She fre, quently goes into the village to shop, personally, and her tours are always, the subject of much discussion., An old Yorkshire shopkeeper has, given away one of the royal secrets., He is authority for the statement that, tin3 Princess has a weakness for royal, pictures. Whenever she visits this old, gentleman’s shop she always spends, a. considerable amount of time looking, over the photographs of the members, of her own family. The Princess is a, great seeker for antiques and never, misses a chance to pick up an old, treasure from an old shop., PREACHERS’ FAMILIES, NO LONGER LARGE, LONDON, Oct. 2. — Clergymen no, longer have large families, the mem, bers of the Neo-Malthusian Birth Con, trol Society were told by Professor, MacBride at a recent conference., Thirty years ago the clergy were, reckoned among the most prolific, members of the community, and right, ly regarded as breeders of talent; but, today road sweepers, dock laborers, and people of that, class Indulge In, large families, while clerical families, consist of only one or two children., The professor declared also that, any species of animal and plant, If al, lowed to exercise unchecked its na, tural powers of reproduction, would in, a few years completely overrun the, earth and crush out other forms of, life., THE POSSESSION OF MONEY, signifies power—it paves the, way by which the ordinary, man can help others and him, self., Therefore, it is perfectly, proper that you should strive,, within reasonable bounds, to, accumulate it., Deposit your surplus funds, in the Bank of Alaska, where, same will draw 4 per cent in, terest, and the temptation, will not be so great to squan, der that which you will need, in future years., Bank of Alaska, UNITED STATES DEPOSITORY FOR, POSTAL SAVINGS FUNDS, 11 11 fl, OREGON WOOLENS, On sale at Hubbert’s Tailor Shop by the yard., All double width goods, including Blue Serges,, Bishop’s Cassimere and Tweeds.

There are, unfortunately, also citizens who have drunl, the poison of revolt. There is more than one, Foster under the American flag. Why are, these men left free, most of the time, to plo1, awl conspire against the nation? There wuis, softness also once in Rome when Cataline am, his fratexmity of bankrupts all bxxt overturn, ed the state, finding apologists in high places, even in the Senate., A gentleman who has made an exhaustive, study of the activity of communists and an, archists xx the United States tells us that ii, nine cases out of ten the financing of these, marplots and traitors can be traced to x, lady’s parlor. Giants of industry have diee, anel left vast riches to waves or daughters, and these wives or daughters knowing noth, ixig of the problems with wdiicli the nation if, confronted, are easily duped by long-hairec, sentimentalists wdio lisp of exact justice anc, plaint cc^nmunism in (roseate luxes. These, women are not told the truth. They think tlice, ai*o financing \'lie millenum and in fact tlxej, are financing hell. They nourish the beasl, that would turn and devour them., We do not know just, how society and Gov, eminent can he protected against women of this, sort, but we do know that the instruments ol, law and order can he ceaselessly employed ix, running down and snaring the actual conspira, tors. To preach reform within the state b\\, legal means is one thing; to plot for the ov, erthrow” of the Government and the destruc, tion of oixr form of civilization is another. One, cannot reason with a snake., WHAT EUROPE DESIRES OF US, “The money which American tourists spent, in Eurone.” complains Miss Edna Ferher, “does not go into the proper channels to aic, Europe.’’, If Miss Ferher’s first-hand noting of this, situation is to he accepted as worthy of con, sideration, It might as well be recalled in con, ncction that little other money which goes, from the United States to Europe seems tc, reach actual need, either. Funds for purclias, es, funds for loans, funds for contributions—, how little they seem to affect economic condi, tions in the old world! Yet these various ex, penditures of America in Europe total billion?, of dollars—enough to make over the countries, receiving the vast sums if only business fore, sight, true wisdom, marked the use of the, wealth by the recipients., “People there do not want us for our, selves,” declares Miss Ferher, “but only foi, what they can get out of us.”, Here is the secret of America’s inability tc, work good in the old world. Europe does noi, want that kind of good to result which the, statesmanship and the philanthropy of the, United States might make possible. “All yout, charity and none of your advice”—thus the, nations which continually exhibit their beg, gars’ sores to us make demand upon our sym, . .... v,, pathy. There must be no end to our willing, ness to pour gold into their hands—and no, questioning from us as to where the money, goes afterward., Pleasure!, political cunning, war plans —, these are the things America is financing, ! across the sea. No wonder the people will not, 5 submit to this nation’s gaze, the results of pro, ■ fiteering from us! Europe dares not make the, truth known, so seeks to silence questions by, \' increasedly stentorian cries for larger gifts,, s “If,” Miss Ferber concludes, “the grumb, ling American could be forced to spend six, months in Europe, lie would return a happy, and loyal citizen.” It is a pity the investment, in patriotism and contentment cannot be gen, erally made. This country has much need of, such thorough reformation of its complainers,, its knockers and its un-American political, schemers., -- -.tr.;, Voice of Alaska Press, ARE THEY SATISFIED?, After all the big talk about how it is the policy of, the present administration to do ail in its power to, devtlop Alaska, it would seem that, had the word been, spoken by some one of the promise-makers, the radio, station could have been saved to the capital of the Ter, ritory. Its discontinuance is a step backward and when, consideration is given to the vast amount of money, spent in junketing trips by “investigators,” the amount, required to continue the radio station at this place, seems infinitesimal. If Alaskans are satisfied with what, they are getting from Washington, all well and good., But are they?—Stroller’s Weekly., •4 n a*, *-—---------- "**a, jj, GYPPING THE TOURIST, It is just about time for the people of Our Town to, rise upon their hind legs and pass a resolution or some, thing which will tell the ignorant piebald world that, Interior Alaska\'s divorce front the White PasS & Yu, kon Route, is a year old and perfectly legal; that Interior, Alaska has the right to marry today any American, proposition which looks good to it; and point- out the fact, that at the trial of the divorce case and thereafter, the, W. P. & Y. never named a co-respondent and that, so, far as that Union-which-was is concerned, Interior Al, aska can still go to the Alter with its golden hair a, hangin’ down its back, pure and clean in the sight of all, men and women., At that, we do not feel as “sore” as maybe we should,, i under the circumstances. “Comers” and “goers" spell, nothing to us but advertising. And we are of the same, opinion still—that advertising which pays must- have, its store dressed right. You can reach a million and a, 1 half people in a day and for $2,000 through a beautiful, ad in the Saturday Evening Post or Ladies’ Home Journ, \' al, and ads will bring results. But if they come to your, store to buy through that ad and find the interior ot, the store a “dump” with four feet of water on the floor,, they are going to believe, that they have been “gypped.", Such advertising never pays. This has not been a season, when we cared to see tourists come—the impression, they would take away with them would be more of a, knock than a boost. Besides, next year you know, 1 what we will have—through trains to Our Town and a, better line of auto-roads than has been, with every, ’ thing here jazzed up to the requirements of the situa, 1 tion. The result will be really worth while. But, this, ; Canadian knocking has been going on for so long and, has cost us so much and has been such a severe knock, to our opportunities that it is now time to take steps, so far as possible to discredit the White Pass & Yu, kon Representatives of Interior Alaska and warn peo, ple not to go to them for directions as to how to reach, us, if they really wish to reach us, for those who go, that way seldom or never get here., What to do, and how to do it, Is the question.

S. Bureau of Mines. The, tnethod. has been used to considerable, extent In both Alaska and the Yukon, Territory., The Bureau of Mines in announcing, the publication of Mr. Janin’s studies, said:, “Experiments in cold-water thawing, demonstrate that under favorable con, ditions the process is an assured suc, cess. It is proving of great value to, the gold-mining industry of Alaska, and the, Yukon Territory and is en, couraging investigation and exploita, tion of areas of frozen gravel that has, been considered of too low grade for, profitable mining., GRAVEL THAWING METHODS, “In placer mining in the Far North, one of the greatest difficulties en, countered is the permanently frozen, condition of the ground. In the early, days of mining the ground was thawed, by the primitive method of building, wood fires on the surface, at the, bottom of a shaft, or at the face of, a drift. Although this method was, slow and costly, a more effective one, ! was not discovered until about 1898,, when it was noticed that the steam es, caping from the exhaust of a hoisting, engine had thawed a hole in the solid, ‘muck.’ Further experiments followed,, and the direct application of steam, through points proved so effective that, it became the chief method adopted in, thawing many millions of cubic yards, of gravel for drift, surface mining and, dredging operations., “Tests with hot-water thawing were, made at different times. Experiments, indicated that ground could be thawed, by this method, but in comparison with, steam thawing the latter was general, ly found more effective. At all events,, no extensive thawing with hot water, was ever done,, HEAVY YARDAGE MOVED, "In all, many millions of cubic yards, of frozen ground have been mined in, the northern fields of Alaska and the, Yukon Territory, as well as Siberia,, by using various methods to soften or, thaw the gravel. The most satisfac, tory method developed was thawing, with steam points. This method, how, ever, proved slow and costly under the, most efficient management, its cost, amounting in general to about 40 per, cent of the total cost of mining and, at some mines to perhaps 70 to 80, per cent. The high cost of thawing, required that the gravel mined con, tain a much higher gold content than, grade ground in the frozen areas,, where thawing was unnecessary, and, prevented the working of the lower, grod© ground in the frozen areas., “The working of most of the deeper, frozen or partly frozen ground seemed, economically impossible except where, drift mining would be profitable. A, number of gravel areas in the Far, North have attracted mining men be, | cause of the high gold content as com, pared to dredgable areas of unfrozen, ground in other districts. Little at, tempt to work much of this gravel, has been made until recently, however,, as no cheap method of thawing was, known. Experiments have been made, from time to time since the beginning, of placer mining in the Far North with, the purpose of developing a more ef, ficient method of thawing the frozen, ground, and the files of the Patent, Office show drawings of some peculiar, machines designed for that purpose., NEW METHOD STARTED, “About 1915 and 1917, different per, sons started experiments on an entire, ly new plan for thawing the frozen, gravel. Water at the natural summer, temperature was applied by drilling, holes through the frozen muck and, gravel to bedrock and the water was, allowed to find its way through the, gravel back to the surface. This water, was taken from surface ditches, or, I, through pipes under pressure, or pres, sure was obtained by pumping. The, results of these tests were very satis, tactory., "Although there is still much to be, learned regarding practical applica, tion of the method, thawing with cold, water has passed the experimental, stage and is being proved of great, value to the gold-mining industry., “The successful application of this, method where water is obtained under, pressure without pumping will mak}, large areas of so-called low-grade, ground available for dredging, and, ground that has previously been con, sidered to be of little or no value will, now be of economic importance. Hud, the knowledge of this method of thaw, ing been available to the Yukon Gold, Company and other companies oper, ating dredges in the Far North dur, ing the past 10 years, there might, have been a considerable saving in, costs and a correspondingly additional, profit to those companies.”, Jack—How shall I sign this letter?, Jim—Sign it “B.

IS FOUND IN, TENNIS RANKS, GIRD—PAGE FIVE .SA- ...., SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 3. — Helen, Jacobs, of San Francisco, 14 years old,, i is being hailed by tennis experts of, the Bay region as a potential tennis, champion. Their views were expressed, after they saw her this mopth reach, the semi-finals in the junior girls’, national hard court championship., It was the first tournament in, which the diminutive racquet wielder, had participated and she took three, games in each set from a young wo, man who because of age was playing, for the last time as a junior., Miss Jacobs’ untrained play dem, onstrated that she has the makings of, a star. Her first service is man-like, and she now will be coached for ac, curacy so that she will not soften h°r, second service. Her fore hand drive, has the speed of a veteran but her, back hand stroke and her stance on, the court can be perfected., Her mental attitude on the court, even when the score is in favor of her, opponent, is what the experts say will, carry her through to high honors. The, girl does not know what a “pat” game, is and even when she has but one, point more to obtain to win a game, she does not play safe but tries for a, kill which will be a winning shot., Dr. C. A. Wills, father and first, coach of Helen Wills, nationally known, as the best girl player, witnessed, two matches in which Miss Jacobs, played and predicted great things for, ner. Heads cf two tennis clubs in the, Bay section have offered to see that, Miss Jacobs gets the right kind of, practice in order that she can de, velop her latent ability., Miss Jacobs was “discovered” bv, Mrs. Blanche K. Ashbaugh, ban l\' ran, cisco tennis player and wife of a San, Francisco newspaperman. Mrs. Ash, l.augh saw possibilities in the girl and, endeavored to interest Miss Jacobs, parents. They thought her ton inex, -orionci=d to accomplish anything n, ♦ ho "Tt\'nnni tournament, but Mrs. Asv>, haun-u thought otherwise and arranged, for Mi\'S Jacob’s entrance in the com, petition., This couple, it seems, delighted, in entertaining, but for some reason, the lady of the house was not very, efficient as a cook or overseer., One evening when Ellis and the, parents of the youngster were at, dinner with the aformentioned couple, the meat course had just been, brought in., After the first bite, the youngester, was heard in a loud voice aside to, his mother: "Oh. look mamma, daddy, -was right.

O’Connor, former resident of, Douglas who visited there lately from, his home in Bellingham, was inter, viewed by the Daily Herald of that, city on his return and, while he has, proper estimate of conditions here,, says the Stroller’s Weekly, he seems, to lay too much blame on the For, - \'estry Department which, in the opin, ion of the majority of Alaskans, is one, ). of the few departments that is really, operated with the view of aiding the, Territory in the matter of substantial, development. The interview in the, Bellingham paper follows:, Answering the question, “What is, the matter with Alaska?” M. J. O’Con, nor, Elk street grocer and for twenty, years a resident of that territory, who, has just returned from one of his an, nual trips to Juneau, Douglas and, neighboring towns, declares that it is, \'f too much governmental regulation and, red tape. After declaring that most, of Alaska is a forest reserve, he says, that if he had his way he would place, the forestry officials on a scow, push, them into the stream and send them, to Washington, D. C., ‘This question, saia Mr. u oonnor,, “has been answered in various ways, by various people. By some who, should know something of Alaska’s, troubles and by some who have onl^, viewed Alaska from the deck of a, steamer. The latter—not all of them,, of course, but a big percentage of, them—go back to their respective, \'homes and presume to speak for the, remnant of trailblazers who still cling, to what is left of that ’great land,, after the numerous departments of, the government have satisfied them, selves that they have securely hemmed, in by governmental regulations, re, strictions and red tape all that was, worth having., RED MEN MAY BE HEIR, “Today everything is conserved in, Alaska but one product—namely fish, —the only product that could be de, stroyed and that is being destroyed., TTlie water power, the forests, the coal, lands, the oil lands—all conserved for, future generations. All conserved for, the remnant of a great race—the noble, redman. It looks very much now as, though he would fall heir to that, great territory. The timber has grown, old and is dying, but tbe prospector, and pioneer, who have blazed the, trails, are not permitted to use a stick, of it without consulting the forestry, department. The water "wr that, has rushed down the mountain sides, since the creation of the world and, was intended by the Creator for man\'s, use and benefit must still run on its, course on account of governmental re, strictions. Any rational human being, knows that the only way you can waste, water is not to use it., “The coal of Alaska has been great, ly overrated. The outcroppings and, vein matter cover an immense terri, tory, but the veins are broken and ir, regular, and it is a much mooted ques, tion as to whether they will ever, amount to much commercially. The, oil lands are yet an unknown quan, tity. Three of the biggest oil compan, ies in the world have gone to Alaska, this summer thoroughly equipped to, determine whether or not Alaska will, prove as rich in oil as it has in pre, cious metals., TOO MANY RESTRICTIONS, “A few days ago I read an article, in the P.-I. by Mr. Ballaine answering, the question, ‘What is the matter with, Alaska?’ He laid all of Alaska’s trou, bles to high freight rates. I do not, agree with him. I do not deny that, the freight rates are too high, but, they have kept neither men nor money, out of Alaska. These are what Alas, ka needs today—men and money—, but neither will be attarcted there, under existing government restric, tions., “My remedy for Alaska’s Ills? Most, all of Alaska today is a forest reserve., I would take all the forest officers in, Alaska and do with them as we did, with the Chinese in the early days—, put them on a scow, tow them out in, the stream, tag them for Washington., D. C., and wish them Godspeed. I, would throw all of Alaska open to, settlement and location, oil lands, coal, lands, water power. Give any man, that wants to settle in Alaska a hunk, if it. After giving a piece of it to all, who agree to live there, there would, still be two or three hundred million, acres left for future generations., UP TO ALASKANS, “The high freight rates can be ad, justed by Alaskans, but. all other mat, ters must be settled at Washington,, the fountainhead of the government., When I lived in Douglas we had no, trouble with freight rates. The mer, chants of my town supported an inde, pendent steamer, keeping rates alway^, where they belonged, and I have little, sympathy for Alaskans today if they, are standing unjust rates., “Alaska will ‘come back’ again, but, not until the government lets loose., There will be other good discoveries,, though I don’t think there will be, anything as big as the Treadwell in, quartz or as big as the Klondike and, Nome fields in placer. The history, of precious minerals bears me out, in this statement. The world to date, has produced only two great mines of, the Treadwell type, the other being the, Homestake at Lead, S. p. In placers, there has never been anything quite, as rich as the Klondike and Nome, areas.”, CHRISTMAS AT ST.

The steamer Starr, which, recently took a winter cargo to the, far-off haunt of the seal-skin coat farm,, numbered among its consignments a, small but stately spruce tree, ad, dressed to Operator Edge of the radio, station. The spruce is, as you might, say, a bit of presufficious in its arrival,, Christmas being still some distance, away. But no chances were going to, be taken this year in the matter of, a Christmas tree, and boats to the, Pribilofs being few and far between,, the authorities took time and tide by, the forelock and had the tree shipped, so that it would be certain to be there, when old Saint Nick comes jingling, along through the ether with his rein, deer about December 25., PACK BURRO PLUNGES, INTO DEEP CANYON, LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2.—Balaam’s, Ass, whatever he (lid to make himself, famous, has nothing on the pack hurro, who plunged 200 feet into the Big, Anita canyon the other day., The Steve Brodie of Donkeydom, ac, cording to Guy Rutherford, in charge, of the Monrovia pack train, took fright, at a rattlesnake and jumped over the, steep side of the canyon, falling 200, feet, and lodged in the thick under, ’brush on his hack.
