A noonday report\ngiving details of final pursuit and sur\nrender of tlie main body of the Russian\ngarrison on the Sakahalln island has\nbeen received as follows:\n"An independent cavalry column on\nthe afternoon of July 23 attacked the\nenemy south of I\'alo and routed him,\nsouthward and capturing two Held\nguns, besides a number of rifles and a\nquantity of amtinition."\nOn July 2f, the cavalry being re-in-forced\nvigorously pursued the enemy\nsouth of Taylan, which lies twenty-five\nmiles south of Rykoff.\nThe enemy halted twenty-five miles\nsouth of Taylan, and at five o\'clock on\nthe inoruing of July 3D sent a letter,\nunder flag of truce, to the Japanese\ncommanding officer from General\nLiapnofT, Russian governor, saying\nthat the lack of Laudato material and\nmedicines and consequent inability to\nsuccor the wounded, compelled him,\nfrom a sense of humanity, to termi\nnate hostilities.\nThe commander of the Japanese\nforce replied, demanding the delivery\nof all war suppbes and property of the\nRussian government, uninjured, and\nthe delivery of all maps and records\nand papers relating to the Russian\ncivil and military administration, and\nrequesting their delivery in reply at\nten o\'clock on tlie morning of July 31;\notherwise an attacking movement\nwould immediately be executed.\nm colonel lonvitcn, on bcnair oi uov-\nertior LiapnofT, met Colonel Koizumi,\nJapanese chWf of staff, \'J accepted\nthe propwt ion.\nIn accordance with these terms Gov.\nLi.ipnoiT, seventy officers and thirty\nwounded of the Russian Harrison then\nsurrendered.\nTokio, Aug. i It is reported that\nadvance guards of the hostile forces\nsouth of Tuman river are within rifle\nrange and an early conflict !s regarded\nas Inevitable.\nYELLOWFEVER\nPANIC SPREADING\nExtreme Measures Taken to\nGuard Against the Plague\nMay Stop Traffic.\nAssociated I\'re.vf.\nNew Orleans, La., Ails\'. 4. The ex\ntreme measures which s\'une districts\narc taking to guard again-t yellow\nfever threatens to put a stop to traffic\nm l bring the federal government into\nthe situation.\nShotgun quarantine and other harsh\nmeasures are general throughout the\nSout h and much suffering Is entailed.\nThousands of people are attempting\nt 1\'ee but are restrained.\nIn many sections of the South great\npan! exists, country laymen refi sing\nto put their faith in the mosquito\ntheory.\nFifty-four new cases have been dis\ncovered here within the pa.st twenty\nfour hours.\nThe exodus from Louisiana towns\ncontinues and large numbers hae\ngone north.\nAt Alexandria a hundred persons\nchartered a special train arid hurriedly\nfled.\nGreat suffering Is endured by those\nattempting to pet away. Two thous\nand refugees were compelled to remain\nin their trains at Joneslxjro, Arkansas,\nsurrounded by state troops. So hur\nriediy had the train been made up\nthat no provisions or water were taken\naboard and the refugees suffered from\nhunger and thirst. Their piteous ap-\npeals for food and water.

The Park\nCommissioners,\' together with line\nmen and surveyors have gone over the\nground and marked the locations\nwhere the artificial lakes are to be\nmade, and laid oir the different ave\nnues and walks preparatory to begin-\nIntr the landscape decoration. It Is\ntheir purpose to turn the overflow\nfrom the city water works into these\nlakes, and it needs no poets pen to\npicture the beautiful garden that can\nbe made to grow where now there is\nnaught but burdock, thistle and\nsand burs.\nHow soon this work of reformation\nis to begin we cannot say, but cer\ntainly there Is no more inviting field\nIn which to labor for "Peautiful Vi-\nnita" than the v.-eed patch known as\nNorth Park.\nOf course this great change cannot\ntake place immediately. It musi be\ngradual. One year will not witness\nit, but five, yos three, will see It ac\ncomplished.\nNow if the present administration\ndesin s to do some one tiling which\nwill commemorate it to posterity. If\nthey desire to even start something\nthat will stand as a monument to\ntheir public career, as other adminis\ntrations have done before them, they\ncan take hold ami assist with this\nwork, for it is said that where two or\nthree are gathered together they can\nstart a kink.\nStart it, and your energy will accu\nmulate. Every citizen will be im\npressed with tlie belief that you have\na special mission to perform and they\nthey too may catch the contagion and\nsleep no xore.\nNow that the work has commenced\nits success not only depends upon the\ndew point and t hermal range, not upon\nthe temperature and rainfall, but up\non the man Umlnd tlie dough, And\nright here some backslider In public\nimprovements has an oppoit unity for\nimmediate \'lis! inct ion.\nMISSOURI\nQUARANTINES\nBoard of Health of State Es\nxablishes Quarantine\nStations.\nAssociated Press.\nSt. Louis.

They have sown grass and\ngrain, are raising cattle and da iry stock,\nand are making money. They live eco\nnomically and work, losing little or no\ntime in going to stores and shops to talk\nand idle, and when it is too bad for out\ndoor work they manage to have some\nthing to attend to in the barns and\nstables, making repairs, fixing harness\nand wagons and plows and implements.\nThey plant small crops, stick to their\nwork, raise fruit trees and vineyards,\nhave many bees and are great milk and\nbutier makers. Poultry, too, is in their\nline, and nearly all the time they have\nsomething to sell to the markets.

TER\n1\nIn the waters around the Caroline\nislands, in the Pacific ocean, there is\na great fish which is armed with tre\nmendous teeth, ret in immensely long\njaws, like those of a crocodile. The\ncreature is extrcm !y savage, and has\na habit of leaping cir-ar from the water\nwhen hooked. As t\'.: natives of the\nCarolines go out in s:.:all, lightly bi:i!t\ncanoes, the fish often cipsi.e the frail\ncraft, and as a result t.!ie fishermen\nhave invented a funny wi.7 of catching\nthem, without running this danger.\nThey make a little roup. .1 kite. The\nframework is formed by the dried ribs\nof leaves from the cocoar. t palm.\nThese leaves are like paper. Ti; ?n they\ndraw a leaf of the breadfruit tr.-e over\nthe framework and attach the k.\'te t:i\na long line. Thus they steer out to sea.\nWhen they reach the fishing\ngrounds they fasten another line to the\nkites. This line has a baited hook at\nthe end, and when the fisherman\nraises his kite the hook trails along\nthe top of the wator. Thus the natives\nare able to hook the fish far enough\naway from the canoe to be safe. When\na fish bites he is al\'owed to tire him\nself out by towing the kite, and when\nhe is too weak to fight any more they\npaddle up to him, hit him with a club and\nhaul him aboard.\nA (Jood Night\'s Rest J\nThe greatest tonic on earth is a good 1\nnight\'s rest.
