Treaty\nopponents won in the first test of\nstrength in the senate today in voting\non the peace treaty. By a vote of 42 to\n40 the senate passed over for one week\nthe third amendment to" the treaty,\nwh ich el imri nates " the ; l7nTteftate&\nfrom memlx-rship in the Belgian bound\nary commission.\nYesterday .was the greatest day in\nReno\'s history and it will be many a\nmonth, perhaps years, before such an-\nother crowd of people collects within its\nconfines. I he occasion was the coming\nof the president of the United States\nand people from all parts of Nevada\nhad come not only to get a glimpse of\nthe president, but to hear him, as many\nj as could, explain the various articles of\nthe much misconstrued treaty of peace\nand the covenant of the League of Na\ntions. Reno was gayly decorated for the oc\ncasion, flags, banners and bunting flying\nand being strung from every conceiv\nable point. The best of order was\nmaintained throughout and everything\npassed of with the utmost precision.\nThere was perhaps a little lack of \'he\nenthusiasm that has attended \'he pres\nident\'s visits to other places on bis tour,\nbut it was not due to an \'absence of\nfaith or lack of sincerity in the presi\ndent\'s words or his purposes. Nevada\nlis and always has been hard t work\nup to the point of acute demonsust\'ort,\nbut once aroused it goes the liint, as\nwitness the pinnacle it has reached in\nib.e various war drives going over the\ntop every time. But at the conclusi-.m\nof the president\'s visit last nignt tnere\nwas every evidence that Nevada\'s great\nbig heart had gone out to the chi-f ex\necutive and that its every bea: was :n\natune with the great purpose :o which\nthe president is "giving his time, his en\nergy and his vitality.\nThe presidential train arrived on\ntime and immediately the parj?d was\nformed and the march taken up to the\nRialto theater, where he was to speak\nand where a crowd of no less than 2.500\nhad gathered to hear him. Admission\nwas by ticket and when the dooi s open\ned at 6:30, though the meeting was re\ncalled to order unt;l nearly 8:30. it took\nonly about ten minutes\' time t fill the\nhouse to its capacity, with thousands\nstill remaining outside.\nThe stage presented a pretty scene,\nfilled to the wings with people, from all\nparts of the state who had received\nspecial invitation and in the front row\nof chairs, facing the vjdk-ncva\'id sur\nrounding the chairs reserved for the\npresidential party were the canteen\nworkers of the Reno Rev\' Cross.\nIt was just 8:20 when ihe presidential\nparty arrived. President Wilson and\nMrs. Wilson in the lead. Governor and\nMrs. Boyle following and the rest close\nin. The whole house arose as ihe pres\nident reached the center of the stage\nand cheers went up that could be heard\nblocks away.\nAs President Wilson\'sat in his chair\nand looked out upon his audience it was\nplainly apparent that he was a tired\nman, and that the strain upon his ener\ngy and vitality was eTiormous. It was\nalso stated by those who have been with\nthe president that he has considerably\ntaged since leaving Washington three\nweeks ago, but when he is talking and\nwarms up to his subject the heavy fines\nin his face disappear, on his lips comes\na smile that is bewitching and from his\neyes a .brilliancy scintillates that can\nI only be inspired by the humane spirit\nthat dwells within.\nThe president\'s talk only took tip an\nhour\'s time, but it was meat, every bit\nof it, and thoroughly shelved the talk,\nnot arciimcnt thnt liio nnnnJt.\no . -j ma air\nj making against both the treaty and\n! league covenant.

Plumb\nappeared to oppose the Cummins hill,\nwhich "would return the railroads to pri\nvate Owners and make strikes a misde\nmeanor. ii\ncould be held against it.\nGovernor Boyle presided at the meet\ning and in a very brief talk introduced\nHon. Charles S. Chandler, who later in\ntroduced the president. Chandler\'s re\nmarks were to the point and only occu\npied a few minutes\' time. He stated\nwhy as a Republican be favored the\nleague and said he denied the right of\ncertain members of his party making a\npartisan issue of it.\nFollowing President Wilson\'s address\na very pretty incident occurred which\nmight prove of interest to Carson peo\nple. Justice Sanders of the Supreme\ncourt occupied one of the chairs on the\nstage, and as the presidential party\ncame on Mrs. Wilson recognized him as\nan old family friend. When the presi\ndent concluded his talk she immediately\nmade for the judge and the judge for\nher and for a minute or two there was\na hearty exchange of greetings in which\nthe president joined. Judge Sanders\'\nfamily and Mrs. Wilson\'s family live in\nthe same town in "Old Virginy" and a\nfriendship exists between them which\ndates back to the days immediately fol\nlowing the Civil war. To hear Judge\nSanders tell it the Boiling girls, one of\nthem now the first lady of the land,\nwere among the fairest that Virginia\never produced.\nA large crowd w itnessed the presiden\ntial train depart from Reno and as i:\nleft the depot the president appeared or\nthe rear platform and bade his adieu U\nthe representatives of a people who\nhave the highest faith in him and who\nwill aiways hold his visit to Nevada a\none of the pleasant memories of life.\nThe Appeal has been furnished with a\ncopy of the president\'s speech, but as it\nis too long for one issue of the paper ii\nwill be published in two sections. - Fol\nlowing is the first part of his speech t\n"My Fellow Countrymen: A charm\ned circle has been drawn around mo\nhere and I think it has something to do\nwith the apparatus in front.\n"The governor and your chairman\nhave both alluded to the fact that it\ndoes not often happen that the president\ncomes to Nevada.

Pershing. The generalissimo of the Allied armies, parting perhaps\nfor the last time with the American leader who shared his task and ;\nwill share his fame, declared :\n"There is bound to be eternal friendship between France and the\nUnited States."\nThese words strike into American hearts, for they express the\nfriendship which should exist, and should persist. Yet there are 1\nmany who are trying to trouble us with cynical sneers at just such \'\nsentiments. They are trying to tell us that the friendship of France\nand of Britain cannot be maintained. When pressed for reasons they j\nfall back on the cynic\'s only arguments, a sneering voice and a curl\ning lip. ;\nBut now that these comrades in arms have parted on the quay j\nat Brest, let us all, Frenchmen, Americans, British, Belgians, Italians, i\nall the late comrades of the war of righteousness, understand the :\nsignificance of such partings. If the nations close their conferences \'\nwith a hidden reserve of distrust, that distrust will come to the.sur-\'\nface to injure and possibly to destroy. Tf the nations are trying to\nutter the eloquence of friendship, while at the same time they are\nlistening to the sneers of cynicism, some day they will utter what\nthey now hear. i\nOn the other hand, if we are whole-hearted and whole-souled in 1\nour devotion to the gallant lands of the Alliance, we can maintain, in \'\nprosperous peace, the bonds which ruinous war could never break. !\nIf we put cynicism out of our hearts, and its ghastly calculations out !\nof our policies, the words of Foch to Pershing will be the words of\nnation to nation throughout the world. j\nThus far the friends of Democracy have triumphed.

What some members of the joint com\nmittee on ways and means and claims of both bouses assert is a surpris\ning condition relative to the comparative cost of food products in Reno\nand Carson was presented by the committee\'s investigation of the cause\nof the deficiencies existing in various state departments, to take care of\nwhich a bill carrying an appropriation of over $50,000 is pending in the\nassembly.\nWhen Warden Henrich appeared before the joint committee to ex\nplain the deficiency existing in the prison fund he produced data show\ning that cost of material used in conducting the affairs of the prison\nhad advanced 40 per cent during the two-year period for which the ap\npropriations made by the legislature of 1917 were made. The warden\npurchased his supplies from Carson City merchants. ,\nf Dr. J. J. Sullivan, superintendent of the State Hospital for Mental\nDiseases, was before the committee Monday and proved to the satis\nfaction of the members of the committee that prices ,on supplies for his\ninstitution had increased 100 per cent during the last two years. Dr.\nSullivan explained to the committee that he purchased his supplies in\nReno. \'\n"I cannot see any reason for the difference in prices in Reno and\nCarson on the same commodities," said one member of the committee\nyesterday. " "If anything prices in Reno should be a shade lower than in\nCarson. In all probability the prices charged the individual consumers\nin Reno would be somewhat higher than those charged Dr. Sullivan be\ncause he buys in bulk, while the individual consumer buys at retail\nprices."\nGUESS MT PRICES MAKE A HIT EVEN IN RENO\ni\ni\nt\nMy G.

The most serious opposition\nthat he has encountered anywhere, on\nhis Atlantic to Pacific tour, presented\nItself to President Wilson in San Fran\ncisco, the metropolis of the state rep\nresented in the Senate by Hiram W.\nJohnson. But ouce again, as has al\nways been the case, the logic of the\nchief executive and his forceful elo\nquence won the plain people.\nRegardless of how their political\nchieftain stands the ordinary citizenry\nof that part of California, is for the\nLeague of Nations and for the quick\nratification of the peace treaty with\nthe league inclusion. Many think that\nWoodrow Wilson and Hiram Johnson\nwill be the contestants in 1920 for the\npresidency of the United States, but\na majority of those who are forward\ning the candidacy of California\'s fa\nvorite son wish that he had not made\nthe league his issue, or now that he\nhas done so, they w ish he would drop\nit.\nHere on the Pacific coast, just the\nsame as in the Middlewest and the\nEast, the people want a peace right\nnow. A peace that will be permanent\nand they want to get things settled\nand start in doing business, because\nthe Pacific coast is more Interested\nin Japan than is any other section\nwhich the President has visited. He\ndevoted the greater pari of his early\naddresses in California to the Question\nof Shantung. He admitted that the\nsettlement in regard to that peninsula\nwas not to his liking but asserted it\nwas the best settlement that could be\neffected when he was dealing with\nthe other great ttowers in Paris.\n"I said to my Japanese colleague on\nthe other side of the sea and there\nfore I am at liberty to say to you,\nthat I am not satisfied with this set\ntlement," the President told two au\ndiences on his l"-t day in San Fran\ncisco. "I think it ought to be differ\nent, but when gentlemen propose to\ncure it by striking that clause out of\nthe treaty, or by ourselves wilhuold-\ntig adherence to the treaty, they pro\npose an irrational thing."\'\nThe President told some of the his\ntory of the Shantung incident in 1898.\nHe explained China ceded the terri\ntory to Jemiany upon the demand of\nthat empire because some German mis\nsionaries had been killed.\nThere "they made an excuse of re\nligion," he declared. Thtm Russia took\na part and then England and then\nFrance. When the Russo-Japanese war\ndeveloped Japan conquered Port Arthur.\nAmerica might have had one of the\nChinese ports also, Mr. Wilson ex\nplained, but President McKinley be\nlieved that inasmuch as their doors\nwere open to our commerce we did not\nwant one and at the same time we\nneed not object to the other powers\nhaving theirs.\nWhen the great war of 1914 came\nthe President said it was imperative\nthat the Pacific ocean be kept clear\nof German shipping and that the Ger\nman possessions in the Far East be\nconquered. It was up to Japan, he\nsaid, to do these things, and Japan\ndid. She took Shantung and kept It,\nthat being her reward by reason of a\ntreaty she had with England and\nFrance for her share in the war.\n"Observe this," the President said in\nexplaining the incident. "We are not\ntaking this territory away from China,\nas some gentlemen have asserted, "but\nwe are taking it away from Germany.\nGermany, not China, held Shantung\nbefore this war. It was German\nrights, not Chinese rights, that were\nceded to Japan by the treaty with\nEngland and France.\n"Shantung will be returned, in due\ntime, to China. Japan has given us\nher solemn promise that this will be\ndone. - Japan-will retain only what pri\nvate corporations have elsewhere in\nchain the right of concessionaires\nwith regard to the operation of the\nrailroads and mines."\nThe President repeated that he did\nnot approve of this secret treaty, but\nhe. was unable to overcome it. Then\nhe pointed out that with the League\nof Nations in effect, the representa\ntive of tlje United States might rise\nand say: "This is against the coven\nant of peace. It cannot be done."\nThen he went on: "And if occasion\narises, we can say, it shall not be\ndone."\nThe rest of Mr. Wilson\'s address\nwas devoted to the benefits of the\nleague to the weak nations of the\nworld, and the unlikelihood that there\nwould ever be war if the powers dia\ncussed and arbitrated their differ\nences. San Francisco gave the President a\ncordial, though scarcely a stirring re\nception. The greeting did not have\nthe warmth of Seattle,. St. Paul or\nSt. Louis, although there was gener\nous applause for the distinguished\nguest wherever he moved. More than\n100,000 persons lined the street lead\ning from the Sausallto feiry as be arrived.\nRiead\nIt - Pays to\n5\nYou ve often heard the saying,\n"It pays to advertise.". That is\ntrue.

He didn\'t say, as\nsome brothers do, "Oh, you\'re only a\ngirl you couldn\'t understand."\nSo he and Dolly carried out the funny\nlittle paper boxes. Billy had some rows\nof ground already prepared for the pots.\nHe had dug the ground up and loosened\nit until it was soft enough for young\nplants. He hoed the ground up into\nrows. Then he made holes large enough\nfor the pots. Then he planted the pots.\nbein;rcarelfi!l to knock off the bottoms.\n"Now," he said, "I think that ought\nto do."\n"Do what?" sked Dolly.\n"You just watch and see," said her\nbrother. "And if you see a Dewdrop\nfairy on one of these seedlings maybe\nhe will tell you all you want to know."\nBilly went into the house to get ready\nfor school and Dolly stood, in the gar\nden, hoping a fairy would soon come\nand tell her about the plants in the pa\nper pots.\nWell, here 1 am. said a voice so\nnear that it made her jump.\nAnd there he was, to be sure. A lit\ntie fellow all dressed in green. His\ncoat was dark green and his vest was\nvery light green almost white. It had\nrather large buttons of the same color.\n"I didn\'t see you at all," said Dolly\n"Of course, you didn\'t. I\'ve only just\nbeen born," said the fairy. Then Dolly\nnoticed that he had a funny little paper\ncap on his head just like the pots she\nhad helped Billy to plant. Only, of\ncourse, the cap was very tiny not much\nbigger than the head of a pin.\n"Yes, I came out of one of those pa\nper Dots." he said, as if he knew what\nshe was thinking. "That\'s the best way\nto plant cucumbers. Ye do not grow so\nvery fast so it is better to give us a\nnice start in the house. Then, pretty\nsoon we begin to grow out here and\nthen, yen just watch us."\n"That\'s what I am going to do," said\nthe little girl.\n"Shall I tell you a secret?" whisper\ned the fairy with the paper cap.\n"Oh, yes; do!" cried Dolly, who lov\ned to have a "secret" with somebody.\n"Well, when my plants get too lively\nthe gardnerpincehs our heads off."\n"Oh!" cried Dolly, much shocked. "I\nthink that is wicked. I will tell Billy\nhe won\'t let anybody do such a thing\nto you."\n"Oh ! we don\'t mind it so much. It\nkeeps the foolish young sprouts from\nrunning away."\n"Where would they run to." asked\nDolly.\n"All over the garden," said the fairy,\ncoolly. "They would scare out every\nother plant on the place. But if we are\npinched good and hard at the right\ntime we are all right."\n"One of the other fairies said some\nthing about running oh. I know!
