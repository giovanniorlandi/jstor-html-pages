SETH LOW NEW MAYOR OF GOTHAM.\nReturn of Fornkcr to the Semite Miulo\nSure by Republican majority In\nDoth Brunches of Ohio Legis\nlature -r- Democrats Curry\nKentucky Legislature\n. Which Will Retire\n\', \' Dcboe Outcome la\nOther Stutes.\nColumbus, O., Nov. 6. So decisive\nIs the Republican victory in Ohio that\ndiscussion naturally reverts to the\ncauser leading up to such a result. Re\nports from all sections show heavy Re\npublican gains In the rural counties,\nindicating dissatisfaction with the\nDemocratic platform by Democrats\nwho still adhere to the Kansas City\nplatform. Not only is Governor Nash\nre-elected with an Increased plurality\nover two years ago, carrying with him\nthe entire Republican ticket, but the\nlegislature will be decisively Repub\nlican In both branches, thus assuring\nthe return of Senator Joseph B. For\naker to the United States senate.\nUnofficial returns from 81 of the 88\ncounties in Ohio show a plurality for\nNash for governor of 55,248. The sev\nen counties not heard from gave Nash\ntwo years ago a plurality of 5,878. As\nsuming that this plurality will be the\nsame this year, Nash\'s total plurality\nIn the state would be 61,126.\nColonel James Kilbourne, the Dem\nocratic candidate for governor, carried\nGOVERNOR GEORGE K. NASH.\nFranklin county, the home county cf\nboth Nash and Kilbourne, which Nash\ncan led two years ago by over 1,000.\nThis and the heavy galnB in Cuyahoga,\nLucas and a few of tho smaller coun\nties was more than offset by the Re\npublican gains in Hamilton, Montgom\nery and a large number of tho rural\ncounties.\nla viewing the outcome Republicans\nmaintain that their victory signifies\nan indorsement of the attitude of Pres\nident Roosevelt in his avowed purpose\nto pursue the policies of President Mc\nKlnley, and an obedient response to\nthe advice of Senator Hanna to "let\nwell enough alone."\nIn the legislative contest It appears\nthat tho "local option" candidates In\nboth parties have been defeated, most\nconspicuous among them being Thom\nas H. Clark In Franklin county, author\nof the Clark local option bill which\npassed the house In tht session of two\nyears ago, and was defeated in the\nsenate by only one vote. This por\ntends that there wil be no temperanco\nlegislation by the ensuing general as\nsembly in Ohio.\nChairman Dick\'s Claims,\nChairman Dick at noon gave out\ntho following statement: We have\nheard from 53 counties, 35 still being\nout. These 53 counties show net Re\npublican gains, over tho election for\ngovernor t-wo yars ago, of, 27,715,\nwhich added to Nash\'a plurality in\n1899 makes a Republican plurality of\n76,738. Cuyahoga county 1b among\nthose not yet reporting, and that\ncounty Is still claimed by the Repub\nlicans, although the Democrats claim\nIt by 73. But with Cuyahoga as a\n"stand off" the net result would be a\nloss to Nash. Jones carried Cuyahoga\ncounty two years ago, and Nash had\n13,911 over McLean; \'deducting this\nfrom 76,738, Nash\'s plurality In 53\ncounties would be 62,827. Then If the\nother 34 counties maintain the ratio\nof tho 53, that are in, the plurality\nfor Nash will be oyer 75,000, and prob\nably over 85,000 for the rest of the\nRopubllcan state ticket. With Cuya\nhoga county conceded to the Demo\ncrats the Republicans have 21 of the\n33 stats senators, and 70 of the 110\nlll\n1KllIli\nrepresentatives, with a probable in\ncrease when the other-34 counties havo\nreported.\nAt Democratic state headquarters no\nofficial statements have been given out\nexcept that they conceded tho state to\nUie Republicans.\nIn .Hamilton county, which includes\nCincinnati, there was a mixed delega\ntion In the lost legislature when John\nR. McLean, Democrat, carried that?\ncounty for governor. The delegation\nthen had only two Republicans. This\nyear the delegation consists of 13 Re\npublicans. Lucas county had two Re\npublican members in the last legisla\nture, but under the new census It has\nfour members, all Republican. Tho\nDomocrats gain four members in\nFranklin and one in Adams and Pike\ncounties. The Republicans gain one\nmember each in Summit, Muskingum,\nRoss and Williams counties.\nTho Republican plurality exceeds\nthe average of 53,000 for the last ten\nyears or since the first election of Mc\nKlnlsV as governor, which has been\ntermed the greatest. Republican era in\nOhio. The plurality for McKlnley for\nPresident last year was 69,030 on a to\ntal vote of 1,049,121, and for Nash two\nyears ago 49,023, with a total vote of\n920,872. The total vote this year will\nnot reach 900,000, and the shortage Is\nconsidered one of the features of the\ncampaign from which tho Democrats\nwere the greater losers.\nChairman Dick sent the following:\nmessage to President Roosevelt:\n"Ohio upholds tho president in his\ndeclaration to continue unbroken the\npolicies of McKnley, by the re-election\nof Govornor Nash by upward of\n60,000 plurality, and the election of a\nlegislature strongly Republican in\nbotfi branches, Insuring the return of\nForaker to the senate." Chairman\nDick sent Senator Foraker a telegram\nsaying "the result in Ohio must be\nvery satisfactory to you, as it is to us,\ninsuring, as it does, your return to\nthe senate. The Republican state com\nmittee extend congratulations."\nChairman Dick also sent a telegram\nto Senator Hanna congratulating him\non the result in Ohio, in which he took\nso prominent and forceful a part.\nHamilton Complete.\nCincinnati, Nov. 6. Complete unof\nficial returns from Hamilton county\nshow tho following vote for governor:\nNash (Rep.) 42,687, Kilbourne (Dem.)\n36,866, Plnney (Pro.) 242, Juergens\n(Soc. Labor) 829, Richardson (U. R.)\n102, Thompson (Socialist) 3,170; plu\nrality for Nash 6,818. The entire Re\npublican county ticket, including 13\nmembers of the legislature, is elected\nby pluralities ranging from 7,069 to\n15,070. The average plurality Is about\n12,500. Nash\'s vote Is about 3,000 be\nlow the average of his ticket, while\nKilbourne ran about 3,000 above the\naverage of the Democratic ticket.

Latest returns\ndo not alter materially the early elec\ntion figures. The most conservative\nestimates place the Democratic major\nity on the state ticket at about 25,000.\nThe Indications are that the Republic\nans have elected one senator and 14\nmembers of the house. This is a gain\nof 11 on the present general assembly,\nbut that body will still be overwhelm\ningly Democratic In both branches.\nIn LTttuTRhody.\nProvidence, R. I., Nov. 6.

This general assembly will\nelect a successor to United States\n\' &y\nSenator William J. Deboo (Rep.), for\nthe term beg\'nnlng March 4. 1903. The\nreturns indicated that the senate will\nstand 26 Democrats to 12 Republicans,\nthe same as tho old senate, and the\nhouse 77 DemocratB to 23 Republic\nans, a Democratic gain of 17. For the\nfirst time in years the returns do not\nshow the election "of a single Populist\nto the assembly.

Returns\ncome in slowly, with half of the 2,100\nprecincts heard from. The same per\ncentage of gain In majority continues\nwith subsequent reports and Cum\nmins, Republican candidate for gov\nernor, will have 92,000 over Phillips,\nDem. The Prohibition vote has ben\nlargely Increased advancing from 9,\n000 last year to 25,000 this year. Prac\ntically every precinct heard from\nshows a falling off In the Democratic\nvote.

Tho\nRepublicans also elected their entire\ncity ticket, with the exception of Da\nvis for sheriff, who appears to be beat\nen by about 600 majority, and the Indi\ncations are that they havo carried all\nthree of the legislative districts, which\nwill give them 18 delegates and a state\nsenator. Returns from the state were\nvery slow coming In. The Baltimore\nAmerican concedes the general assem\nbly to the Democrats on joint ballot by\na majority of 12.\nTho Baltimore Sun claims the legis\nlature will be Democratic in both\nbranches. \'ihe senate probably 17\nDemocrats to 9 Republicans, the house\n49 Democrats, 39 Republicans, doubt\nful 7.\n\'ihe total vote of the general as\nsembly on Joint ballot is 121, requiring\n61 votes fox a majority. Tho member\nship of the house Is 95, of which 46 is\na quorum. The Democrats thus ap\npear to have a majority of both houses.\nSan Franclcco\'s New Mayor.\nSan Franclsqo, Nov. 6. Eugene E.\nSchmltz, the Union Labor candidate\nfor mayor, has been elected by a plu\nrality of about 2,500, A. R. Wells\n(Rep.) running second, and J. S. Tobln\nthird in the race.

The\nDemocrats lost two members in the\nsenate and gained 16 in the House of\nRepresentatives. The actual political\ndivision, however, is to be determined\non the final .settlements of several\nclose fights. On the face of returns\nthe \'house stands 166 Republicans, 72\nDemocrats and two social Democrats,\nwhi-e uie senate Is 32 Republicans and\nseven Democrats.\nDenver Democrats Won.\nDenver, Nov. 6. In the election of\ncounty officers in Colorado the Re\npublicans won In most of the large\ncounties except Arapahoe, In which\nthis city is situated. Complete re\nturns from all the precincts In this\ncity and all county precincts except\none show that all the Democratic can\ndidates were elected by majorities\nranging from 2,000 to 4,000. The Dem\nocrats also carried Teller county, in\nwhich is Cripple Creek. The Repub\nlicans won In Pueblo, El Paso, Lake,\nJefferson, Boulder, Larimer, Gilpin\nand La Plata counties.

Coray, Jr., the Fusion candi\ndate, by between 50,000 and 55,000 plu\nrality. In 1899. Barnett (Rep.), for\nstate treasurer, had a plurality of 110,\n588 over Creasy (Dem.). William P.\nPotter (Rep.) defeated Harman Yerkes\n(Fusion) for Judge of the supreme\ncourt by about 5,000. The vote polled\nin the state was unusually light, but in\nthis city the vote for state treasurer\nexceeded Barnett\'s vote for the same\noffice In 1899 by more than 25,000.\nFusion Failed In Nebraska.\nLincoln, Neb., Nov. 6. On further\npreoinct returns from over the state\nthe Republican state central commu\nte made an estimate placing the plu\nrality of Judge Sedgwick at 7.000. The\nfusion committee will not concede de\nfeat, but say3 the result will bo ve:y\nclose. Returns on regents of the uni\nversity show they do not differ great\nly from the heads of the tickets. All\ncalculations were upset by the vote in\nsome counties heretofore fusion, not\nably Nomaha, Buffalo, Nuckolls, Clay\nand Kearney, which this year gave\nRepublican pluralities.\nBIG EOLL OF BILLS.\nWoman Arrested on Suspicion cf\nllulig ! to \'.en liank Notes.\nSt. Louis, Nov. 6.
