V., lor\nfrcu tncdic.il uJvice.\nA STOLEN SMILE \'ER TWO\nAmerican corn is apparently gaining favor with our neighbors\nin other parts of the world. The exports of corn, says the Trade\nRecord of The National City Bank of New York, are now running\nat a rate which suggests that the fiscal year 1922 may "break\nthe record" in the exportation of this most important of our cereal\ncrops, and certainly in the sums of money which it brings into the\ncountry. The March exports of corn were 22,000,000 bushels\nagainst 13,000,000 in the same months of last year, and in the 9\nmonths ending with March 135,000,000 against only 36,000,000 in\nthe same months of the preceding year, suggesting that the total\nfor the fiscal year 1922 may perhaps surpass the banner year 1900,\nwhen the corn exports were 213,000,000 bushels, while the value\nof the 1921 exports is $93,000,000 against $85,000,000 in the former\nhigh record year, 1900.\nEven this big total of $93,000,000 worth of corn exported in\n1921 does not include that sent abroad in other forms, for the corn\nmeal and flour exported in 1921 was about 3 1-2 million dollars\nin value, and the glucose and corn sugar produced from corn ag\ngregated 6 1-2 million dollars in value, carrying the total export\nvalue of corn \'and its products in 1921 above the 100 million line,\nagainst less\' than 90 nfillion dollars in the former high record year,\n1900, and an average of 45 million dollars a year in the period from\n1900 to the end of 1920. This estimate of over one hundred million\ndollars worth of corn and its products exported in 1921 does not\nattempt to include the meats, for it is our big corn crop that makes\nthe United States the world\'s biggest producer and exporter of\nmeats.\nWhether prohibition has had anything to do with any efforts\nwhich the corn producers of the United States may have made to\npush their sales abroad cannot be determined, though it is a fact\nthat the pre-prohibition use of corn in distilling and brewing\nranged as high as 50,000,000 bushels a year. At least the rate at\nwhich the exports jire now running, 22,000,000 bushels per month,\nis at a rate far in excess of the average exportation of the two\nhigh record years, 1898 and 1900, which were the only years in\nthe history of our export trade in which the total exports crossed\nthe 200 million bushel line, while the value of the corn exports in\nthe 9 months ending with March, 1922, $87,000,000, is greater than\nthat of any full year preceding except 1921, when it stood at $93,\n000,000 for corn alone. At least it is apparent that the fiscal year\n1922, which ends with June, will far exceed any preceding year in\nthe value of corn exported, and approximate $130,000,000, to say\nnothing of the corn products which may bring the total up to\n$150,000,000 for this most important of our cereal crops.\no 7\nThe soldier bonus will be a life-saver to the government be\ncause it will make a hole in the mint.
