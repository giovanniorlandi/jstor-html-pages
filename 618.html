The Republi\ncan Btate convention, which assembled\nIn Carnegie hall Saturday, elected the\nfollowing delegates at large and their\nalternates to the national convention,\nwhich Is to meet In Chicago June 16:\nDelegates at Large Stewart L.\nWoodford of New York city, Seth Low\nof New York city, Frederick R. Hazard\nof Onondaga county, Edward H. But\nler of Erie county.\nAlternates at Large John Raines of\nOntario county, Thomas P. Peters of\nKings county, Norman J. Gould of\nSonera county, Charles W. Anderson\nof New York.\nMr. Anderson Is President Roose\nvelt\'s colored Internal revenue collec\ntor for the Second district. He Is the\nfirst colored man in the history of the\nRepublican party of the state to be\nelected an alternate at large to a na\ntional convention. There has never\nbeen a colored delegate at large.\nThese delegates at large and their\nalternates were directed by the con\nvention to use all hono\'able means to\nbring about Governor Hughes\' nomina\ntion fur president.\ndilutes II. Duell of New York and\nJohn (,. Wlckser of Buffjlo were chos\nen as presidential electors at large\nand the others by congiess distilcts.\nEdgar T. Hrackett tried vainly to\nhave adopted a substitute resolution,\nfavored by a minority of seven me -hers\nof the 37 members of the com\nmittee on resolutions, couched In these\nwords:\n"The Republicans of the state very\nearnestly favor the nomination of\nGovernor Hughes for the presidency at\nthe coming convention; they will not\nbe satisfied with a support by the dele\ngates that Is perfunctory or spiritless.\nJn view of this sentiment and of re\ncent events, the delegates at large\nselected by this convention are In\nstructed and delegates from the sev\neral districts are requested to persist\nently labor for his nomination, until a\nnomination Is made."\nBracket\'s Amendment Beaten.\nMr. Braekett\'s proposed amendment\nprecipitated a Bharp debate on the\nconvention floor, and the 1,009 dele\ngates and the hundreds of spectators\nIn the galleries were aroused to a\nhigh point of excitement. When the\ndebate reached a point of high ten\nsion, Speaker Wadsworth moved that\nthe question of adopting te minority\nreport of the committee on resolutions,\ncontaining the Hughes indorsement,\nalong the lines of the convention In\ndorsement of Levi P. Morton In 189B\nand of President Roosevelt in 1900, be\nput to the convention, and, with ap\nplause nnd much cheering, the major\nity report was adopted by a viva voce\nvote, with only a few scattering noes\nheard above the shouts of the ma\njority. Believing that the platform fore\nshadowed the platform that will be\nadopted by the Chicago national Re\npublican convention, more than usual\nInterest attached Itself to the reading\nof Its recommendations, which were\nconfined practically to national issues.\nThe platform Indorsed in strong\nterms the administration of President\nRoosevelt and Governor Hughes and\ncommended the policies of the federal\nadministration. A revision of the tar\niff was favored and the action of con\ngress In declining to revise the tar\niff by piecemeal was warmly commend\ned. Changes were advocated In the\ncurrency law to provide a more elastic\nand satisfactory monetary system.\nChairman Woodruff announced for\nmer governor Odell and Herbert Par\nsons, chairman of the Republican\ncounty committee, as a committee to\nescort M. Linn Bruce to the platform\nas temporary chairman.\nSenator Raines announced that his\ncommittee on permanent organisation\nhad officially selected Representative\nSherman to bo the permanent chair\nman of the convention and Repre\nsentative S. E. Payne and former Rep\nresentative Lucius N. LIttauer escort\ned Mr. Sherman to the platform.\nTom Piatt Absent.\nFor the first time In a score or\nmore of years Thomas C. Piatt, one\nof the Big Four and onetime leader of\nthe party In state councils, was not in\nhis accustomed seat with the Tioga\ncounty delegation. It was said that\nSenator Piatt was ill. Senator De\npew was on the platform.\nMassachusetts Delegates Uninstructed\nThe four men who will lead the\nMassachusetts delegation to the Re\npublican national convention will\ngo to Chicago unhampered by any\npledges. The four delegates who were\nselected at the state convention are\nUnited Slates Senators Henry Cabot\nLodge and W. Murray Crane, former\nSecretary of tho Navy John 1). Long\nand Sidney O. Blgney, business man.\nThe convention adopted resolutions\nIndorsing Governor Curtis Guild, Jr.,\nas a candidate for the vice presiden\ntial nomination and advocating a\n"wise revision" of the tariff. On the\nquestion of the presidential candidacy\nof Secretary of War William H. Taft,\nthe platform stated that the conven\ntion "recognized that a majority of\nthe delegates to the convention de\nsired nts nomination," Dut that it was\n"uncertain whether a resolution ol\npreference would be carried and Its\npresentation would certainly lead to\na contest which would be Injurious ta\nthe welfare of the party."\nAgainst Political Activity.\nThe army orders contain a prohibi\ntion against political activity on pari\nof the classified civil service employee\nand also against the contribution or\ntbe solicitation of campaign funds.\nThe order is based on a decision by\nthe president to Secretary Taft In\nclosing a communication from the\ncivil service commission setting forth\nthe regulations on the subject The\npenalty for political activity as set\nforth In the regulations is:\n"Any man violating the provisions\nof t\'ne rule In question renders him\nself liable to punishment by removal."\nThe rule to which this attaches Is:\n"No person In the executive civil ser\nvice shall use his official authority or\nInfluence for the purpose of interfer\ning with any election or affecting the\nresult thereof. Persons who by the\nprovisions of these rules are in the\ncompetitive classified service, whll\nretaining the right to vote as they\nplease and to express privately their\npinions on all political subjects, shall\ntake no active part In political man\nagement or In political campaigns."\nAs to campaign contributions, at\ntention is called to the recent decision\nof the supreme court of the United\nStates which embraces in the term\n"solicitation" the mailing of letters or\ncirculars to federal employes at their\nplaces of employment, as well as so\nlicitations made In person.\n$10,000,000 Fire In Boston.\nAn apparently Insignificant fire\nwhich started among rags on a dump\nIn the city of Chelsea, a suburb of Bos\nton, was fanned by a northwest gale\nInto a conflagration which obliterated\nnearly one-third of the city. Five\nhundred dwelling houses and public\nbuildings were destroyed, 1,500 fami\nlies were driven from their habita\ntions, and 10,000 people made home\nless. Two lives are known to have\nbeen lost and It was reported that two\nother persons had perished, one a\nwoman, having shot herself in a fren\nzy over her inability to save her prop\nerty. From uO to 75 persons were In\njured. In the confusion attending the situa\ntion, accurate eHtimrtes of the loss\nwere impossible. The city police es\ntimated it at nearly $10,000,000.\nThe fire was the worst Greater Bos\nton has known In many years, raged\nbefore a 45-mile anhour gale for more\nthan six hours, defying the combined\nfire departments of Chelsea and sev\neral nearby cities and a large detach\nment of Boston firemen and apparatus.\nWithin an area of half a mile square\nwere several churches and school\nhouses. One by one they fell before\nthe flames. Flaming embers failing on\nsteeple and roof would almost In\nstantly envelop the whole structure\nIn flames and in the intense hent the\nbuildings survived but a few minutes.\nWhen the tip of the steeple of the\nPolish Catholic church caught fire\nsome pieces of apparatus were rushed\nthere in an effoit to save the building.\nServices had just ended and many\npeople were In and about the edifice.\nIn fifteeu minutes the entire top of\nthe church was In flames. All the\nmovable effects and furniture were re\nmoved. A hundred yarrrs away the First\nUnlversalist church caught fire In ex\nactly the same manner as the Polish\nchurch and It soon was enveloped In\nflames. The pastor declared that the\nloss will be fully $80,000.\nAgnew-Hart Bills Beaten by Tie Vote.\nThe vote of Senator Cassidy of\nSchuyler, creating a tie vote of 25 to\n25, defeated, for the time at least, the\ntwo Agnew-Hart bills embodying the\nrecommendation of Governor Hughes\nthat the legal protection be abolished\nwhich since 1895 has protected public\ngambling at race tracks while it is a\nfelony elsewhere In the state.\nLieutenant Governor Chanler, In the\nchair, by his casting vote to break the\ntie upon a parliamentary motion which\nbut for him would have resulted in Ir\nrevocably killing the bills for the bal\nance of the session, saved them for\nanother vote at the discretion of their\nIntroducer, Senator Agnew, at any\ntime when the order of business per\nmits him to call up the matter.\nSenator Wilcox\'s Action Denounced.\nSeveral hundred persons attended\na mass meeting on Sunday In the First\nMethodist Episcopal church at Au\nburn, N. Y., and applauded enthusias\ntically while six speakers vigorously\ndenounced Senator Wilcox\'s action\nin voting against the anti-race track\ngambling bills. The senator is a\nmember of the First church. Resolu\ntions were unanimously adopted de\nclaring that the senator had not rep\nresented the community by his vote\ntnd that those ut the meeting protest\ned against his action and demanded\nthat he reconsider his vote If given\nthe opportunity in the future. The\nresolution ex\'enried an offer of\nhearty co-operation to Governor\nHughes and the supporters of the bill.\nFaddist Died From Starvation.\nKnute Ohnstead died at St. Paul,\nMinn., from starvation, after an at\ntempt to last for forty days In or\nder to demonstrate his theory that\nthe mind is mightier than matter.\nOhnstPad\'s fast lasted thirty-one days,\naccording to those In the house.\nAmerican Civic association is arous\ning public interest in the convention\nto be held at the White House May\n13-15 to consider the preservation of\nthe nation\'s natural resources..\nTODENVERUNPLEDGED\nProgram of New York State\nDemocratic Convention.\nReport of Majority of Committee on\nResolutions Will Criticise Republi\ncan Administration and Invite a\nDemocratic Victory In November,\nbut No Mention of Candidates.\nNew York, April 14. The Demo\ncratic state convention summoned for\nthe purpose of selecting four delegates\nat large to the national convention at\nDenver on the 7th of July met In Car\nnegie hall, where last week the Re\npublicans of the state chose their del\negates to the Chicago convention,\nwhich will nominate the official foe of\nthe Denver candidate. The assem\nblage was called to order by State\nChairman William J. Conners of Buf\ntalo, whose amiable but rugged coun\ntenance indicated his satisfaction in\nthe complete flattening out of last\nwinter\'s attempted move to depose\nhim from the Democratic leadership.\nNearly all the old wheelhorses of the\nDemocracy were on hand when Chair\nman Conners\' gavel announced that\nhe was ready for business, but con\nspicuously absent were David Bennett\nHill, who considers that he has earn\ned the right to retire from politics,\nand Congressman Bourke Cockran,\nwhose retirement was accelerated by\nCharles F. Murphy. Mr. Murphy\nwas there, spliinxlike, as usual, and so\nwere the indomitable and Inevitable\nBrady and "Long Pat" McCarren, cool\ner than the proverbial cucumber and\napparently little alarmed by the antl\nMcCarren uprising in Brooklyn.\nContest of McCarren and Coler.\nMany state committeemen at the\nmeeting held yesterday said that they\nconsidered the most important busi\nness to be settled by the convention\novershadowing even the selection of\nthe delegates at large was the con\ntest of the sixteen of the twenty-three\nassembly district delegations form\nKings county. Seven of the twenty\nthree districts are not contested be\ncause the leaders of these districts re\npudiated Senator McCarren Just prior\nto the primaries held on March 31. If\nthese contestants are seated it will\nmean at least the temporary eclipse of\nMcCarren.\nAmong the contesting delegates are\nmany of the leading lights of Brook\nlyn Democracy, including former gu\nbernatorial candidate and Borough\nPresident Bird S. Coler, ex-Congressmen\nRobert Baker and Mitchell May,\nex-judges and many county officials.\nBorough President Coler Is the head\nand front of the fight to politically\nexterminate McCarren, and if the sen\nator Is defeated It will no doubt force\nthe leadership of Kings county upon\nColer, though he declares he does not\ndesire to be leader, that his only am\nbition is to dethrone McCarren and to\nleave the question of leadership open.\nThe basis of this fight is the alleged\nfrauds committed In almost every elec\ntion district In which there was a con\ntest at the primaries to elect delegates\nto the convention. Coler and his\nBrooklyn delegation have prepared\nhundreds of affidavits charging all\nkinds of violations of the law. Tee\ncontestants laid the mass of evidence\nbefore the state committee yeste\'-dry\nand the whole matter will be thre.!ie1\nout before the committee on creden\ntials. State Chairman Conners and\nTammany leader Murphy are said to\nbe in favor of seating the Coler dele\ngates. If so. they will be able to have\nIt done, as they are credited with hav\ning control of the state committee\nand therefore the naming of the com\nmittee on credentials.\nAmong the men mentioned as possi\nble delegates at large are Alton B.\nParker, the Democratic candidate for\npresident in the last national cam\npaign; Lieutenant Governor Lewis\nStuyvesant Chanler, who has a presi\ndential boom of his own this year; D.\nCady Herrlck, who came very close to\nbeing elected governor of New York\nfour years ago; State Chairman Con\nners and Charles F. Murphy of Tam\nmany Hall. Bird S. Coler may be one\nof the big four if he succeeds In his\nlight against McCarren.\nDelegates at Large Unknown.\nChairman Conners said that the con\nvention will be in session two days In\norder to give all contesting delegations\na chance to be heard.\nThe names of only two of the dele\ngates at large, he said, have been\nsettled upon Charles F. Murphy and\nhimself. The declination of Mayor\nMcClellan to attend the national con\nvention, ho added, had upset the plans\nof the leaders and it was possible\nthat the names of the other two dele\ngates would not be determined until\nthis afternoon.\nThe Bryan Progressive League open\ned headquarters in the Victoria ho\ntel yesterday and sent a delegation\nheaded by William It. Black, to Bee\nCharles F. Murphy. Mr. Murphy told\nthem that one of the delegates at largo\nto be chosen In the state convention\nwould be friendly to William J. Bryan.\nIn this connection the name of Lew\nIs Nlxon Is said to be under consider\nation. Mr. Murphy Informed the dele\ngation that no Tammany delegate\nwould be permitted to give his proxy\nto the state convention to Augustus\nThomns, the president of the Bryan\nProgressive League, who Is scheduled\nto address the convention in advocacy\nof Ml. Bryan\'s candidacy.\nMr. Thomas has a proxy from a del\negate from up-state but efforts have\nbeen made to secure a Manhattan\nproxy for him.\nASKED TO RETRACT.\nDelegation Had No More Influence on\nSenator Ackroyd Than His Wife\nand Daughter.\nAlbany, April 14. Senator Joseph\nAckroyd of Oneida was visited last\nnight In the senate lobby by a group\nof men from Utlca urging him to re\nverse his vote cast last week against\nthe Agnew-Hart anti-gambling bills.\nThese men were sub-committee of a\ncommittee appointed at the mass\nmeeting held In Utlca Sunday, which\nwas addressed by Governor Hughes,\nand included ex-Mayor Henry Martin,\na Democrat; John L. Maher, former\npresident of the Utica Chamber of\nCommerce, who said he was a Republi\ncan, who had voted for Senator Ack\nroyd; George Greenan. T. S. Griffith,\nG. W. Adams, F. S. Kellogg, Hugh R.\nJones, William V. Jones and H. D.\nFarley.\nThe embassy caused a sensation In\nthe senate and the Interchange was at\ntimes rather spicy.\n"We are here as representative busi\nness men, both Republican and Demo\ncratic, and urge you to support the\ngovernor in his effort to have the man\ndate of the Constitution carried out,"\nlaid one of the members of the dele\ngation to Senator Ackroyd.\n"This is a state proposition," replied\nSenator Ackroyd, "and when I voted\nagainst these bills I considered myself\nas representing the constituency of the\nentire Btate, not alone the local con\nstituency of Oneida county."\n"But we. as residents of Oneida\ncounty, Bent you here to represent us,"\nreplied one of the visitors, "and we\nbelieve we are entitled to some\nrights."\nSenator Ackroyd informed the com\nmittee that he had received letters\nfrom Oneida county both for and\nagainst the racetrack bills and when\nhe voted against them he did what he\nthought was right. He informed the\ndelegation, however, that he would\ntake their request under consideration.\nSenator Ackroyd said last evening\nthat he was not a candidate for re\nelection. He added: "My wife and\ndaughter have been urging me to re\nverse my vote and I declined to do so.\nTf I would not do It for them do you\nsuppose I would for any one else?"\nAgainst Individual Contracts.\nCleveland, April 14. At a meeting\nof the Marine Engineers\' association\nheld here a resolution was adopted de\nclaring that the executive committee\nof the association regards such Indi\nvidual contracts as have been signed\nby members of our association as a\nmenace to our membership and other\nmembers are warned against signing\ncontracts of any kind until further no\ntice. It is declared that this means\nthe union marine engineers will not\ntamely submit to th eopen ship de\nclared last week by the Lake Carriers\'\nassociation, which controls 91 per cent\nof the tonnage on the Great Lakes.\nEconomical.\n"I believe I have found the prize\nwoman economist," said an cast side\nbaker the other day. "She has just\nmoved Into my neighbor! 1, and I\nunderstand the family Is by no means\npoor. Tho wife came into my place\nMonday nnd bought a dozen small\ncakes. I supposed they were for tea\nthat evening. Imagine my astonish\nment when she came back 1\'rlday\nevening carrying a small paper sack,\nfrom tho depths of which she carefully\ndrew forth three of the Identical cakes\nI had sold her four days before. Nod\nding her head toward them, as she set\nthem down on the counter before ine,\nshe said sweetly, "Won\'t you please ex\nchange these for some fresh ones\';\' at\nthe same time indicating a batch that\nI had brought from the oven not half\nan hour before."\n"Well, what did you do?" asked the\nbaker\'s sympathetic friend.\n\'"Do? I gave her -three of the fresh\nones. I think I must have been mes\nmerized. Next tiling I know she will\nbe bringing back the bread crusts to\nhave new loaves put Inside them."\nColumbus Dispatch.\nOdd Baby Customs.\nAmong the Parsecs when a child Is\nborn a priest takes the place of the\nmedicine mail, carefully noting down\nUll details of blrtli and "calculating its\nnativity" to a nicety.

The attor\nney general sent to Speaker Cannon a\nletter in reply to the house resolution\nasking what steps have been taken by\nthe government to Investigate the al\nleged combination of wood pulp or\nprint paper manufacturers. The at\ntorney general says an Investigation is\nIn progress but no evidence has yet\nbeen obtained to Justify legal pro\nceedings. He say that when the Investiga\ntion and the report thereon Is com\npleted he will submit them without de\nlay If he can do so without affecting\nthe Interests of justice, but that If the\nInvestigation should lead to civil or\ncriminal proceedings It may continue\nexpedient to temporarily withhold\nfrom the public the evidence and In\nformation. "It Is proper for me to say in thli\nconnection," says the attorney gen\neral In his letter, "that certain al\nleged facts were submitted to this de\npartment when the above-mentioned\ninvestigation was commenced which\napparently authorized the belief that\nserious and readily-proven offenses\nagainst the laws of the United Statei\nhad been committed in the premises,\nand Immediate action by the appro\npriate officer was thereupon promptly\nordered; but these orders dlsolosed\nthat no lesal proof could be secured of\nthe alleged offenses, the evidence re\nlied upon to establish them turning\nout to le merely hearsay, and the\ncomplainant himself, who had furnish\ned this Information, refusing to give\nthe name of a witness Btipposel to\nhave personal knowledge of the said\nfacts.\n"Before taking action under the so\ncalled "anti-trust law\' It has been the\nunvarying practice of this department\nto very thoroughly sift the allegations\nof such complaints, nnd the consider\nable proportion of successful prosecu\ntions under the said statute seems to\njustify this practice.\n"In this Instance, Information so\nas aforesaid furnished, when sifted,\nshowed an undoubted, general and\nconsiderable increase In the prices of\ncertain kinds of paper, but that such\nIncrease was due to any contract,\ncombination or conspiracy In restraint\nof trade was a matter of conjecture\nand suspicion only, although it seem\ned probable that proof to establish\nthis might be found through a search\ning and judicious Inquiry.\n"I regret that the public Interest\nprevents me from fully and promptly\ncomplying with the request contained\nIn the above mentioned resolution.\nWhen this investigation has been\ncompleted and the report of the Unit\ned States attorney entrusted there\nwith Is received I may be In a posi\ntion to furnish the house of repre\nsentatives with the papers and In\nformation called for, without Injur\niously affecting the Interests of Jus\ntice, and I shall, In such case, submit\nthem without delay. If, however, the\nsaid Investigation should lead to civil\nor criminal proceedings. It may con\ntinue expedient to temporarily with\nhold from the public evidence and In\nformation now or hereafter secured,\nbearing on the situation, until such\nproceedings shall have been finally de\ntermined."

Lanson,\nTbe contest for tbe Republican nomina\ntions, while quite spirited, especially on\ntbe Assembly and County Commissioner\nquestions, as yet very orderly and with\nout any brass band accompaniments. On\nthe latter office tbe vote was exceedingly\nclose between Wm. Harrison and Fred\nReib, and not until the last precinct was\nheard from could any one say which of\ntbe two had been successful. The Pro\nthonotary contest also developed a close\nbitch between J. C. Gelst and Harry\nHarp, the former winning by eighteen\nvotes, according to tbe face of the returns.\nThe Republican turnout was very good\nand showed that Interest in political af\nfairs is by no means on tbe wane Iu tbe\nparty. Under tbe new primary law tbe\nqualifications of voters are the same as at\nthe general election and voters are no\nlonger permitted to cast . their ballots\nwherever they happen to be on election\nday, making it easy to swell the vote at\nprimary contests because of the loose\nmethods heretofore prevailing.\nWe publish a table this week embracing\neach office on which there was a contest.\nThis table is not official, but it is not\nlikely that tbe official figures, which will\nnot be canvassed until today, will change\nthe result any. The totals for all oandi\ndates are not obtainable at present, but\nwill be given later.\nTbe ticket nominated is a good one and\nwill commend itself to the voters at the\nNovember election.. Every one of the\nsuccessful candidates is a stanch Republi\ncan, and having received a clear plurality\nof tbe Republican voters of tbe county, is\nentitled to tbe united and loyal support\nof the party. Let us drop whatever feel\ning of disappointment that may have\ncome out ol tbe little family contest aud\ngo about to elect all our candidates by\nold fashioned majorities.\nSenator Allison says In an interview\nthat the Senate has not deteriorated In bis\ntime. He believes that "Tbe develop\nment of the country is continuous. We\nare advancing in education, in methods,\nand In processes. We are an active\npeople and in my opinion will continue\nso.

Burdick, gen\nerally working for his father on saw mills,\nbnt in April, 1907, went to Illinois and\nprocured a pumping job at Robinson,\nwith the Red Bank Oil Co. In Jauuary of\nthe present year be made bis parents\nvisit for a few days, but was compelled to\nmake his visit Bbott on account of only\nhaving a short vacation. On March 30th\nhe steamed some oil to be run out by the\npipe line gauger, and on the 31st was get\nting up stuam to pump the oil out with a\nfield pump, when the boiler exploded\nbadly mutilating his body and killing\nhim almost instantly. His brotber-in-law,\nG. W. Barney, wired his parents of\ntbe sad accident, and after a funeral serv\nice at the Frst M. E. Church at Robinson,\nthe remains were started for this place,\nand were met at Sheffield by his relatives\nand friends where the remains were in\nterred. Homer was a general favorite\nwherever known, and was always ready\nto join in any social function. About\nthree years ago he began the work of the\nSavior and was "faithful unto death."\nThis fact was proven by the most beauti\nful tribute of sympathy and love sent to\ntbe parents by tbe Robinson Sunday\nSchool class of which he was a member.\nWe shall miss him but he la safe, and we\nhave the consolation of knowing that if\nwe prove faithful we shall again be united\nin Paradise.\nine norai oneriogs at the funeral were\nmany and very pretty. The funeral ser\nmon was preached by Rev. R. J. Mont\ngomery of Kellettville, in the Miuister\nchurch, where young Mr. Burdick was\nmember. Thus a young man is cut down\nin tbe prime of life, when we look for old\ner ones to go first. Life is so uncertain that\nit pays to be ready, like Homer was, to\nmeet our God. May we all meet him in\nheaven "on that Great Day."
