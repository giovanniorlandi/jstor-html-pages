The, dictatorship must be established to, suppress counter - revolutionary, movements of the capitalists and to, firmly establish the new order. The, working class, having captured the, political power, must use that pow, er to entrench themselves as the do, minat ruling CLASS, unless such, time as the expropraition of capital, ist property and the abolition of in, terest, rent, and profit has eliminat, ed economic classes, class interests, and class interests and class antag, onisms.”, Another motion states that “The, Socialist party regards the general, strike as a powerful weapon of the, working classs.” This motion adds, EMPRESS, TONIGHT AND TOMORROW, Cecil B.

Any, faction or group within the party,, ■ however small and unrepresentative,, may submit such a tentative motion, for inclusion in the aganda, with the, distinct understanding, however,, that this procedure carries ^ith it, absolutely no endorsement or sanc, tion for the proposal\' by the commit, tee who makes up the agenda., Thus among a mass of other mo, tions to be submitted at the meeting, will be the following, taken from the, printed copy of the agenda issued:, “A motion that the “Socialist par, ity of the United States renew its, j application for membership in the, ; Communist International upon the, ’basis of complete acceptance of the, twenty-one points of affiliation.”, Another motion on the same sub, ject says: “That the Socialist party, of the United States renew its ap, . plication for membership in the, Communist International with the, reservation that we accept no bind, i ing formula for the attainment or, |organization of the Socialist society:, and retain complete autonomy in, j matters of membership, organiza, tion and tactics and in regard to our, program and declarations regarding, ^questions which are primarily of do, ;mestic concern., A rocnl u ♦ inn rlnol Jner milk Ikn nn, however: "However, considering, that it requires a high degree of or, ganization, discipline and solidarity,, it is evident that the advocacy of a, general strike in the United States, under present conditions is folly., Years of education and organization, lie before the American working, class before the general strike can, pass from theory to reality.”, Political strikers are advocated in, one motion but warns that it is eP,, fected where there is sufficient sen, timent to insure a general and will, ing compliance with the strike ord, ers and that political strikes called, for light or trivial reasons are fore, doomed to failure and will result in, discrediting this powerful weapon., Another motion dealing with the, Socialist attitude toward organized, labor says in part: “As part of the, militant forces of the working class, of this country, we reaffirm that ad, herence to a policy of political beg, ging, of political trading with the, capitalists’ parties, on the part of, the labor movement is degrading, and detrimental to the interest of, the workers.”, .Still another motion says: “The, working class government must not, hesitate to use the most vigorous, methods, if necessary, to suppress, forcible opposition by the minority, and maintain its supremacy. The, workers must not allow anything to, stand in the way of their being the, ruling class as long as classes or, remnants of classes remain.”, Competitive motions, advoca, ting exactly the opposite view to, many of these here expressed are, similarly guarantted a hearing un, der the “agenda” system., STAKE PROSPECTORS, TO LOOK FOR GOLD, Alaclro Steamship, /ilaolva Company, F.

Senat, or McCormick succeeds Senator Miles Poindex, ter, of Washington, who steered the committee, through the last national campaign and Novem, ber elections, and Whose work was largely re, sponsible for the heavy Republican gains made, in the senate., Senator McCormick is the best choice the Re, publican senators could have made for a leader, of the committee. He belongs to a prominent, and very wealthy Chicago family and was elec, ted senator from Illinois, and prior to his house, service having been a prominent member for, two terms of the Illinois general assembly. Sen, ater McCormick is well qualified by training,, experience, and ability to head the Republican, senatorial campaign committee., In the 1922 campaign the Republican sena, torial campaign committee will work in close, co-operation and complete harmony with the, national Republican congressional committee,, which is made up of house members, and which, is headed by the astute and remarkable polit, ical manager, Representative Simeon,D. Fess,, of Ohio. Representative Fess was the chief- of, this committee when the Republicans made, great gains in the 1918 congressional campaign,, and again last November when Ihe house went, overwhelmingly Republican. Representative, Fess, who is also one of the noted scholars and, authors of the country and a former college, president in Ohio, is a splended example of the, “scholar in politics.” It is indeed rare to find, a man who is an expert, successful and extrod, inarily able political manager who is at the, same time a real scholar. It would be a good, thing for American politics if there were more, men like Representative Fess among the lead, ers of both parties., Senator McCormick is a man like Represent, tative Fess, for the Illinois senator is a gradu, ate of Yale and is something of a scholar him, self as well as one of the most astute observers, avc have in public life. McCormick recently, made a tour of war-stricken Europe Avliere he, gained much first-hand information that will, be of great value to the senate and the adminis, tration. !«, In the 1922 congressional elections thirty-two, seats, \'or one-third of the senate membership,, Avill be at stake. These seats are equally divid, ed among Democrats and Republicans. Both, parties Avill make tremendous efforts to hold, the seats they already have and make gains., Republican senators Avliose terms expire are:, C alder, New York; France, Maryland; Freling, liuysen, New Jersy; Hale, Maine; Johnson, Col, ifornia; Kellogg, Minnesota; Knox, Penna, Lafollette, Wisconsin; Lodge, Massachusetts;, McCumber, North Hhkota; McLean, Connecti, cut; New, Indiana; Page, Vermont; Poindexter,, Washington; Sutherland, W7est Virginia;, Townsend, Michigan., Democratic senators whose terms expire are:, Ashurst, Arizona; Culberson, Texas; Gerry,, Rhode Island; Hitchcock, Nebraska; Jones,, New Mexico; Kendrick, Wyoming; King, Utah;, McKellar, Tennessee, Myers, Montana; Pitt, man, Nevada; Pomerene, Ohio; Reed, Missouri;, Swanson, Virginia; Trammell, Florida; Will, iams, Mississippi; Wolcott, Delaware., A survey of the situation at this time leads to, the conclusion that the New York, Maine, Min, nesota, California, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,, Massachusetts, North Dakota, Connecticut, In, diana, , Vermont, Washington, West Virginia,, and Michigan seats will be retained by the Be, publicans because these states are normally Re, publican., Among the Democratic seats it may be safely, predicted that the Democrats will hold Texas,, Tennessee, Virginia, Flordia, and Mississippi., These are strongly Democratic states. But Ten, nessee may go Republican. It went that way, last November. In the other states, Arizona,, Rhode Island, Nebraska., New Mexico, Wyom, ing, Utah, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Missouri,, and Delaware the Republicans have a good, fighting chance, and in some of these states,, like Rhode Island, Ohio, and Delaware, the Re, publicans have more than a fighting chance, in, fact in these states it seems a certainity that the, Republicans will win the seats now held by the, Democrats., Because practically all of the Republican, seats are in strong Republican states, and at, least three and perhaps more of the Democratic, seats are in states that are likely to go Repub, licans in 1922, while some other Democratic, seats are in the states that may go Republic, an, it seems to be on the cards that the Republic, ans will make considerable senatorial gains in, the next elections. If the 1922 elections show, only a part of the Republican form of last No, vember the Democrats are due to lose a consid, erable number of seats and they may lose a, large number., ---, One of the curses of our nation today is the, attempt of too many of our citizens to run their, neighbors’ business. Too many persons have, assumed the attitude that everyone is a prof, iteer but himself. This has been strikingly, illustrated in the public utility industry., Voice of the Alaska Press, With 19 alleged bootleggers under indictment at Ketch, ikan, it would appear as if Alaska is not bone dry after, all.—Juneau Empire., * * >* *, After reading the names of the Alaskan guests at the, banquet tendered to the Hon.

It begins at the baseball grrounds, backstop and ends at the Canadian boundary near the, Premier mine It will never be fully efficient until it con, nects with a Hyder wharf.

The parties are, well equipped for the entire season’s, operations., The largest party is headed by J., W. McCord, general manager of the, Westward Development Company,, representing many claim holders in, the Cold bay district. In his party, are L. C. Decius, of the Southern, Pacific oil division; J. W. McClos, key, geologist of the Associated Oil, Company; Dan Noland, -chief geolo, gist of the General Petroleum Com, pany, and James F. Wood, Jr., geolo, gist for the same company. Ernest, Marquardt, of the New York Oil, Company, who will work with J. J., Finnegan and associates in the Cold, bay district this season, is also, aboard the Watson., The government geologists, mem, bers of the geological survey, are, divided into two parties. One of, these, under Fred H. Moffit, will, debark at Snug harbor and investi, gate the llliamna field. Mr. Moffit, is accompanied by Volney L. Gray, and S. C. Towley. This party has, 11 pack horses and necessary field, equipment for the season. S. R., Capps, who has made extensive sur, veys of interior Alaska mineral dis, tricts, is in charge of the second geo, logical survey party. He has 1G, pack horses and supplies for the, season. This party will go into the, Cold bay fields, landing its outfit at, Portage bay. Supplies and equip, ment and 13 pack horses for Otis, Ross, U. S. surveyor, now in the, field in Cold bay, are also on the, Admiral Watson., Mr. McCord, who recently returned, to the Pacific coast from an extend, ed stay in Washington, stated that, President Harding and all of his, cabinet members are deeply interest, ed in the territory and anxious to, evolve a policy which will result in, its development. He was cordially, received in Washington and was, given a full hearing on the Alaska, oil situation. The decision of the, government to issue permits to all, applicants without regard to appar, ent conflicting claims, on the under, standing that such conflicts, if they, exist, be settled within six months,, was obtained after much work by in, terested parties, said Mr. McCord, who believes that this action has ad, vanced the development of Alas, kan fields materially. Mr. McCord, is convinced that all questions of con, flict will be amicably settled by, claimants after the survey made this, summer has been filed., There will be no drilling done in, the Cold bay field this season, ac, cording to McMcCord. His company, and probably all others will await, the result of the investigation of the, geologists now en route there. If, - . 414 IU1Q UlCp UCVCiUp, nient work will be pushed as rapidly, as possible. It is planned, however,, to make shipments of material and, machinery late this fall and freight it, in during the winter, he said., After the McCord party has con, cluded its examination of the Cold, bay field, it will visit the Iniskin, bay district, Yakataga and Katalla,, according to Mr. McCord. It does, not expect to return to the states, before this fall., Mr. McCord with William N. Paine, of 29 Broadway, New York, formerly, assistant director of operations of, the U. S. shipping board, purchased, the Ripple, a 240-ton steam-trawler,, which will be placed on the run be, tween Seward and Alaska peninsula, points, which will give service not, only to the oil fields, but to all other, communities in the district, said Mr., McCord. The vessel’s name will be, changed to the Westward., The boat, he said, is the best of, its kind that could be purchased, and was bought only after consulta, tion with Captain Paul Foley, di, rector of operations for the U. S., shipping board, and prominent east, ern shipping men. The boat has a, speed of 10^4 knots, is well equipped, and has plenty of space to meet, every demand at present. Mr. Mc, Cord stated that the Pacific Steam, ship Company will operate the ves, sel at least temporarily after it Is, placed on the ran. The boat is one, of three built for ice-breaking at Vlad, ivostok and was recommended by, Captain Foley as most suitable for, the work it will be called on to do., “I found administration officials, ready to give Alaskans a fair hear, ing and I believe that anything with, in reason that they, ask for the ad, ministration will give to them,” said, Mr. McCord. He said that he was, given much assistance by Delegate, Sutherland, who accompanied him to, meetings with several cabinet of, ficers and other officials in Wash, ington., IffiNANANEWS, TOLD IN SHORT, PARAGRAPHS, (Special Correspondence), NENANA, June 25.—Deputy Mar, shal Anders arrived at Hot Springs, on the steamer Tanana and will, remain here until the return of Dep, uty Hagan from the Iditarod., Ralph Dutcher returned to Nenana, on the steamer Tanana to resume, his duties in the local office of the, American Yukon Nevigation Company, after a winter spent in the states., Gordon Betties, who came north, when red foxes could be bought from, the natives for less than $2 a pelt,, is among the recent arrivals in Ne, nana. He is getting an outfit to, gether tor a trip into the hills., The committee in charge of the, Billy Williams fund announces that, arrangements have been made for, the departure of the oldtimer on, the first through boat leaving Ne, nana.

The state had attacked the, validity of the divorce, claiming, there was collusion between Miss, Pickford and Moore. Attorney Gen, eral Leonard B. Fowler announced, that the decision would be appealed, to the state supreme court., Mary Pickford, who^e divorce from, Owen Moore, was attacked by At, torney General Leonard B. Fowler, of Nevada, was granted her decree, here March 20, 1920 by District Judge, Frank P. Langan and, in a short, time, married Douglas Fairbanks in, Los Angeles, Cal. Moore, Fairbanks, and Miss Pickford, who gave her, name ui uie acuun waa uiauja, Moore, are motion picture stars., Testifying at the divorce trial,, Miss Pickford said she came to Ne, vada Feb. 15, 1920 for the benefit of, her health. She charged Moore with, desertion and cruelty. Moore was, not present at the hearing and did, not contest, although on the day be, fore he was served with the sum, mons in Douglas county, in which, Minden is located. Miss Pickford, testified she did not know Moore, was in Nevada at the time. Follow, ing the divorce both left the state., Nearly one month later, on April, 16, 1920, after Miss Pickford and, Fairbanks were married, Fowler filed, an action here asking that the de, cree be set aside “in the interests, of the state of Nevada.” He charged, Moore and Miss Pickford with "fraud, and collusion,” declared Judge Lan, gan had no jurisdiction in the case,, as both principals resided in Los, Angeles, said the decree was “color, able,” said the principals held the, Nevade court in “utter contempt”, and charged that the marriage of Miss, Pickford and Fairbanks was part of, a “fraudulent plan concocted by the, defendants.” Moore, he alleged,, came to Douglas county solely to sub, mit to service of the summons. The, attorney general’s action was predi, cated, he declared, on the principle, that the state reserves interest in, all divorce cases., Attorneys for Miss Pickford an, swered the attorney general’s charges, and asked that the suit be set aside., They asserted the attorney general, had no authority under Nevada laws, to bring this action and declared that, if the principle on which the state’s, suit was predicated was sustained,, the attorney general could review all, divorce cases tried in Nevada. The, defense counsel said no one case, could be found as precedent .for Fow, ler’s action. The righ tof review,, which the attorney general said he, held, was attacked. The state, it was, claimed, was represented at the trial, by the court and the court’s action, in granting the divorce was final., They also held that the divorce was, legal in every way, that the resi, dence requirements had been lived, up to and claimed there was no col, lusion between Miss Pickford and, Moore. •, PRESERVE BULLETIN, BOARD AS WAR RELIC, (By Associated Press), HELENA, Mont., June 27.—A gigan, tic bulletin board erected on a down, town street here during the war) and, bearing the name‘>of every Lewis and, Clark county man and woman who, served with the military forces of the, United States in the conflict, is to be, preserved as a historical relic of the, time., The matter has been taken in, charge by committees of the commer, cial club and the local post of the, American Legion.

In tempera, ment and intelligence, there has been, none like him among aspirants for, heavyweight honors. He will be out, weighed by Dempsey when they, clash. Other physical measurements, may also appear to be to the disad, vantage of the Frenchman but the, essential item of courage will not, be included in these shortcomings., Carpentier, born in the coal mining, district of Lens, France, fought as a, youngster of 12 years and progressed, steadily through the various weight, classes, meeting the best boxers of, France, England and America until, he now stands near the pinnacle in, pugilistic sport., A survey of the opponents Carpen, tier has met in the ring and sketches, of several battles in which he re, vived from a count of nine to out, point or knock out his rival? in sub, sequent rounds convinces one of his, ring courage. He has fought among, Bijly Papke when he was only 18, Bombadier Wells, Joe Beckett and, Gunboat Smith. Some of them he, met when a youth in his late ’teens., His fight with Frank Klaus and, Billy Papke when he was only IS, are declared to have been the most, grilling in his career. In victory or, defeat throughout his ring campaign,, Carpentier has been guided by Fran, cis Descamps toward the heavy, weight championship goal which he, will endeavor to reach at Boyle’s, Thirty Acres in Jersey City on July, 2. The list of opponents Carpentier, has met is more impressive than that, of Jack Dempsey’s rivals. In ring, experience, Carpentier is by far the, older., The first battle with Bombadier, Wells at -Ghent is declared to have, been one of the most impressive ex, hibitions of courage by the young, Frenchman, who was outweighed, many pounds. He took, the count, of nine in the first round, to come, back and knock out his opponent in, the fourth. Befpre they met the sec, ond time, he predicted Wells might, last one round but the Englishman, was kp/6cked out in less than one, minute., Harry Lewis, in the ftmrth round, of a bout, broke two bones in his, right hand, hitting Carpentier on the, cheek bone with a smash that cut, a deep gash under the eye. Carpen, tier came back to outpoint Lewis in, 20 rounds. When he lost a 15-round, decision to Joe Jeannette, Carpen, tier was sent to the mat two or, three times but refused to stay and, dropped the negro twice for a count, of nine., But this anomaly of the boxing, game has done his most important, fighting outside the ropes. The cock, pit of an army combat plane has, seen his most thrilling engagements, age. Cited for heroism several times, in the World war, Carpentier wears, the Croix de Guerre and the Military, 'Medal, of all decorations, the most, prized by the French soldier., Comrades of Carpentier relate how, they had watched him thousands of, feet in the air attacking an enemy, or swooping low over a Boche camp, or airdrome while German anti,, aircraft guns tried to make a sieve, of his plane. Often, they say, they, mournfully uttered good-byes to the, youth, only to see him a few min, utes later climbing out of the ship, wearing the smile that spectators, at Jersey City undoubtedly will see, when he enters the rings to meet, Dempsey., Hard Training, Over for Dempsey, (By Associated Press), ATLANTIC CITY, June 27.—Hard, work is over for Dempsey until he, enters the ring.
