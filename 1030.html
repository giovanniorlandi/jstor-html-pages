When developing the model, we have in mind some industries where the marketing competition to secure a large\ninstalled base is intense. The social commerce industry is a representative example of this type of industries, but the scope of this\nstudy is not limited to the industry. We first introduce a previous study focusing on the static Nash equilibrium, and then present\nan extended version of the basic model in a dynamic perspective. According to our analyses on the dynamic equilibria together\nwith their stability, there may be a unique interior equilibrium, but it is highly likely unstable. In addition, possible (near) boundary\nequilibria are also unstable for a wide range of parameter values. We also conduct some numerical experiments and discover cycles\nas solutions to some particular instances. Since those cycles contain the ToC traps, a policy measure or regulation may need to be\nemployed. Our approach and results will help to figure out a clue to escape from the ToC trap, thereby shedding new light on the\nsustainable growth of the business ecosystem, which is prone to excessive marketing competition.\n1. Introduction\nAs the mobile services and SNS (social network service) are\nbecoming the most common and popular media to access\nand use the Internet, they are rapidly replacing PCs and other\ntypes of information devices dedicated to serve a specific purpose.\nInformation flows through socialmedia keep increasing\nand will change the way of organizing and leading businesses\nand industries. For example, marketing practice has entered\na new horizon, where mobile social media plays a central\nrole in firms’ marketing campaign and reduces the entry\nbarrier by expanding the spheres of activities and lowering\nthe access costs. One can find representative cases in the\nsocial commerce industry which utilizes social media as a\ncommercial platform. It is not surprising to discover a strong\nincentive to construct a business model with Facebook and\nTwitter, each of which retains more than 1 billion and 5,000\nmillion users over the globe, respectively.\nDespite their tremendous success in creating new service\nmarkets and expanding the business areas, SNS platforms and\nother e-commerce providers based on socialmedia facemany\nchallenges in practice. In particular, the social commerce\nproviders have experienced rise and fall over a short period of\ntime right after their beginning (MacMillan [1–3], Reibstein\n[4], Webster [5], and Wheeler [6]). Indeed, the number of\nproviders is decreasing in many countries. Groupon, the first\nglobal social commerce company, went through hardship in\nits IPO (initial public offering) and suffered sharp drops of its\nstock price right after the IPO.\nThese problems and challenges are not found only in\nthe social commerce area. In effect, when innovators and\npioneers plan to monetize eyeballs, they are likely to be\nexposed to the risk that arises from those problems. In\nthat sense, the issue may be generally embedded or innate\nproperty of many business areas, which directly or indirectly\ndepend on the installed base (Kumar and Rajan [7] and Patel\n[8]). Even for Facebook and Twitter, for example, the dream\nof advertising revenue has yet to be substantially realized, and\nmany potential investors are still stuck at the thinking that\nif these providers could secure a large number of users, they\nwould be able to sell new products and services to their users\nin the future (Cusumano [9], Kruschwitz [10], and Leber\n[11]).\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nJournal of Applied Mathematics\nVolume 2014, Article ID 952046, 11 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/952046\n', '2 Journal of Applied Mathematics\nIf this is the case, the entire industry is highly likely\nto plunge into a marketing competition, where each player\ncompetes to expand its prospective installed base by reinforcing\nmarketing activities in a broad sense. SNS, social\ncommerce, online/mobile games, telecom services, andmany\nICT business areas experience and suffer from marketing\nwars fighting for customers and users.\nOne of the major backgrounds of the marketing competition\ncomes from the cost structure of the corresponding\nindustry. For example, a low entry barrier as in the case of\nsocial commerce (Anderson et al. [12], Reibstein [4],Wheeler\n[6], and Urstadt [13]) makes it possible for a great number\nof potential players to enter the industry once they observe\na positive gain above the normal profits. Seeking the first\nmover’s advantage may be another driver of the marketing\nwar. In such a case, relatively few competing providers spend\nlots of cash on advertising activities. Telecom operators and\npharmaceutical companies are the best example of this case.\nWe will call this type of industries the “marketing-intensive\nindustry.”\nHowever, it is not easy to find analytical studies about\nthe marketing competition of this kind. One major reason\nfor the meager literature on this inherent weakness of the\nmarketing-intensive industries can be found in a tradition\nof economic studies. That is, firms and providers are typically\nassumed to seek for the profit, not for the market\nshare. But, recent changes occurring across the broad range\nof industries defy this tradition. One of them is fusion\nor convergence across multiple industries, which conceals\nthe exact financial gain of a company participating in a\nbusiness ecosystem built upon multiple industries. Another\nbig change is referred to as “servicification,” which emphasizes\nthe trend that services are increasingly essential as\nboth inputs and outputs in many industries including even\ntraditional manufacturing areas such as automobile and\nconsumer electronics (Lodefalk [14], Schmitt and Hatfield\n[15], and Stephen and Toubia [16]). The ICT industries,\nparticularly social media services, experience both trends,\nthereby exposing themselves to fierce competition for market\nshare.\nThis study suggests a modeling framework for and conducts\nanalysis of the marketing-intensive industries vulner-\nable to the risk of collapse due to excessive competition to\nexpand the installed base. Such industries are prone to getting\nmired in marketing wars due to inherent properties in the\nbusiness model itself (Though we started this section with\nmentioning the socialmedia industry as one of representative\ninstances that fit our model assumptions, the application\nscope of our approach will not be confined to social media\nand other ICT industries).We first develop a stylized business\nmodel that captures the essential features of the competition\nprocess. Our approach focuses on the relationship between\nkey decision issues such as marketing inputs and market\nvalue. As more providers join the industry thanks to the low\nentry barrier, they are inevitably faced with fierce competition.\nThis may lead to sharp increase in the expenditure\nrelated to marketing and advertising activities in a broad\nsense. This type of competition may lead the industry away\nfrom its optimal development path and, at worst, toward a\ncollapse of the entire business ecosystem as described in some\nICT business cases above.\nHaving such a case, the situation that we will deal with in\nthis study resembles ToC (the tragedy of the commons; Alroy\n[17], Hardin [18], Greco and Floridi [19], and Knowledge at\nWharton [20]), where the user market (the commons in our\nmetaphor) is vulnerable to exploitation by providers’ aggressive\nmarketing to enhance their installed base. Thus, another\ngoal of this study should be to examine the possibilities and\nconditions that ToCmay occur in such a business ecosystem.\nIn fact, oscillations and/or emergence of ToC are not a\nspecial case but rather common in dynamic formulations.\nThey have been observed in many different circumstances, in\nparticular, with a structured population (Perc and Szolnoki\n[21], Perc et al. [22], Santos et al. [23], Szolnoki and Perc\n[24], Szolnoki and Perc [25], and Szolnoki and Perc [26]).\nHowever, such a dynamic nature not unusual in natural\nphenomenonmay also prevail over stable equilibria, particularly\nin the business areas characterized by severe marketing\ncompetition on the basis of a perfectly mixed population. If\nit is true, we should examine the possibility of unintended\nconsequences of an excessive competition as it is likely to\nimpinge upon market maturity. For that purpose, we will\nanalyze the process that plunges the business ecosystem into\nToC and conduct some experiments in order to investigate\nthe effects of the parameters in our model. Our approach and\nexpected results will help to discover some clues to escape\nfrom this kind of traps, thereby shedding new light on the\nsustainable growth of themarketing-intensive industries such\nas the social media businesses. We will also present some\npolicy implications that could be attained in the course of\nimplementation of our suggestions to alleviate the risk of\nToC.\nIn one of the previous researches on this subject, Kim\n[27] presents static gamemodels that deal with homogeneous\nas well as heterogeneous providers in the social commerce\nindustry. In this study, we will also build game models with\nheterogeneous providers and derive explicit equilibria in a\ndynamic setting. This study primarily takes the social media\nindustries into account but is not confined within a specific\nindustry as in Kim’s study [27]. In particular, the dynamics\nadopted in our model will show sharp contrasts between\nstatic and dynamic approaches in terms of the equilibria,\nstability, and their resulting insights.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The next section\nintroduces the basic model and static analysis. Section 3\nprovides our dynamic model and analysis and compares the\nresults with ones from the static case. In the next section,\nwe present some experiment outcomes together with their\nlessons and policy implications. Our final section concludes\nthis study and suggests some future works.\n2. Basic Model and Analysis\n2.1. Basic Model. Let us suppose a player set composed of\n𝑁 potential SC providers, where 𝑗 is employed as the index\nfor an individual (sometimes representative) SC provider. N\ndenotes the set of SC providers; that is, N = {1, . . . , 𝑁}.\n', 'Journal of Applied Mathematics 3\nAmong 𝑁 providers, some providers may not join the\nmarket. The strategic decision variable of SC provider 𝑗 is\nits marketing efforts 𝑒𝑗. Those who do not join the market\nexercise 0 marketing efforts.\nIn our model, SC providers are assumed to be horizontally\ndifferentiated according to their marketing capabilities,\nwhich is the major factor characterizing the providers. We\nemploy 𝑞𝑗 to represent the overall marketing costs of provider\n𝑗 and assume that 𝑞𝑗’s are inversely proportional to the characteristic\nof marketing efficiency. Furthermore, the potential\nproviders in N are given their index in an ascending order\nbased on this attribute. Accordingly, the lower the index is, the\nmore efficient it is inmarketing; for example, the first provider\ninN (i.e., 𝑗 = 1) bears the lowest marketing cost 𝑞1.\nIn each time period, the entire value of the SC market, 𝐺,\nis determined by two factors. First, when all the providers in\na subset 𝑃 of N (i.e., 𝑃 ⊆ N) are active in the market, the\ntotal marketing efforts 𝐸 (= ∑𝑗∈𝑃 𝑒𝑗) contribute to the market\nvalue 𝐺 by stimulating consumers and boosting the market.\nHowever, 𝐸 also exhibits a negative effect on 𝐺 since too\nmuch or too little marketing efforts over- or underexploit the\nmarket.Thus, a deviation from the optimal level of marketing\nefforts in a certain situation may harm the market conditions\nin the following period (refer to (1) below).\nSecond, the entire value of the SC market is also\naffected by environmental factors such as consumer preference\nchange and technological development. We abbreviate\nthese environmental factors into 𝑀 as in (1), which will\nbe called “the market maturity factor.” However, 𝑀 will\nnot be assumed to be given exogenously as in Kim’s study\n[27]. Instead, we will develop a dynamic model where 𝑀 is\nendogenously determined based on the providers’ decisions\n(refer to Section 3).\nAs 𝑀 and 𝐸 change from one period to another, 𝐺 also\nexperiences a series of changes. We incorporate the following\nrelationship between the market value and two major factors\nexplained above:\n𝐺 = 𝐺 (𝐸 | 𝑀) = 𝑀 ⋅ 𝐸 ⋅ (2𝐾 − 𝐸) , (1)\nwhere 𝐾 in (1) represents the optimal level of the total\nmarketing efforts 𝐸∗ embedded (but probably hidden) in the\nSC industry. Accordingly, (1) implies that a total marketing\neffort lower than𝐾 leaves a room for further expansion of the\nmarket, while a total marketing efforts higher than 𝐾 incurs\nan overheating and entails a contraction of the market in the\nfollowing periods.\nThe market value 𝐺 realized in the current period is\ndistributed over the active SC providers in the corresponding\nperiod. We assume that the allocation of 𝐺 is proportional to\nthe marketing efforts 𝑒𝑗’s. Therefore, the share of the active\nprovider 𝑗, 𝑔𝑗, is determined by 𝐺(𝑒𝑗/𝐸) = 𝑀 ⋅ (2𝐾 − 𝐸) ⋅ 𝑒𝑗.\nThen, the net benefit of the provider 𝑗, 𝑟𝑗, is as follows:\n𝑟𝑗 = 𝑔𝑗 − 𝑞𝑗 ⋅ 𝑒𝑗 = {𝑀 (2𝐾 − 𝐸) − 𝑞𝑗} ⋅ 𝑒𝑗. (2)\nThose who decide not to join the market (i.e., 𝑒𝑗 = 0) get 0\npayoff. Others who participate in the market try to predict\nthe total marketing efforts 𝐸 and determine their marketing\nefforts 𝑒𝑗’s, each of which maximizes the corresponding 𝑟𝑗.\nUnfortunately, however, possible miss predictions result in\nlosses for some providers, that is, resulting 𝑟𝑗 < 0 for some\nproviders. In the next period, the providers who experienced\nlosses in the former period will leave the market or try to\nminimize its loss. In our model, once a provider decides to\njoin the market at 𝑡, it cannot retreat at 𝑡. Therefore, when a\nprovider experiences a negative payoff, the provider chooses\nthe marketing level which actually minimizes its loss. Once\nthe number of active providers 𝑃(𝑡) = 𝑝 is determined,\none can show that providers’ optimal marketing efforts are\nexplicitly determined as in the following section.\n2.2. Static Analysis. This section introduces Nash equilibria\nof the static model based on the previous study of Kim [27].\nBefore presenting some key results in Kim’s study [27], let us\ndefine some notions and terms for ease of explanation and\nenhanced readability:\nΘ𝑛 =\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n1\n1\n2\n1\n2\n⋅ ⋅ ⋅\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n⋅ ⋅ ⋅\n1\n2\n... d\n...\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 1\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n, 𝜇𝑛 =\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n𝐾 −\n𝑞1\n2𝑀\n𝐾 −\n𝑞2\n2𝑀\n...\n𝐾 −\n𝑞𝑛\n2𝑀\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n,\n𝑄 (𝑛) =\n𝑛\n∑\n𝑗=1\n𝑞𝑗, 𝐸 (𝑛) =\n𝑛\n∑\n𝑗=1\n𝑒𝑗,\n(3)\nwhere Θ𝑛 is (𝑛 × 𝑛) square matrix and 𝜇𝑛 is 𝑛-dimensional\ncolumn vector whose elements start with 𝑗 = 1 in the\nincreasing order. By the property of the symmetric matrix,\nthe inverse matrix of Θ𝑛, Θ\n−1\n𝑛 , is also symmetric and derived\nas follows:\nΘ\n−1\n𝑛 =\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n2𝑛\n𝑛 + 1\n−2\n𝑛 + 1\n−2\n𝑛 + 1\n⋅ ⋅ ⋅\n−2\n𝑛 + 1\n−2\n𝑛 + 1\n2𝑛\n𝑛 + 1\n−2\n𝑛 + 1\n⋅ ⋅ ⋅\n−2\n𝑛 + 1\n... d\n...\n−2\n𝑛 + 1\n−2\n𝑛 + 1\n−2\n𝑛 + 1\n⋅ ⋅ ⋅\n2𝑛\n𝑛 + 1\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n. (4)\nProposition 1 (see Kim’s study [27]). For readability, one\nomits 𝑡 in 𝑀(𝑡) and 𝑃(𝑡). Suppose that there are 𝑃(𝑡) = 𝑝\nproviders as in the increasing order of 𝑞𝑗’s. That is, 𝑝 providers\nwhose indices spread from 1 to 𝑝 in N now enter the market\nat 𝑡. Let 𝑦(≤ 𝑝) denote the index of the provider with 𝑞𝑦 ≤\n(2𝐾𝑀 + 𝑄(𝑝))/(𝑝 + 1) and 𝑞𝑦+1 > (2𝐾𝑀 + 𝑄(𝑝))/(𝑝 + 1).\nThen, the marketing effort profile (𝑒1, . . . , 𝑒𝑦, 0, . . . , 0), where\n𝑒𝑗’s are determined as follows, constitute a Nash equilibrium:\n𝑒𝑗 = {Θ\n−1\n𝑦 ⋅ 𝜇𝑦}𝑗\n= 2 (𝐾 −\n𝑞𝑗\n2𝑀\n) −\n2𝑝𝐾\n𝑝 + 1\n+\n𝑄 (𝑝)\n𝑀 (𝑝 + 1)\n, (5)\nwhere {x}𝑗 represents the 𝑗th element of the vector x.\nProof. Omitted (for proof,see Kim’s study [27]).\n', '4 Journal of Applied Mathematics\nProposition 1 presents a Nash equilibrium of the basic\nstaticmodel. Note that there ismarginal provider represented\nby 𝑦. Then, those who have lower index than 𝑦 earn positive\nprofits (i.e., 𝑟𝑗 > 0, for all 𝑗 ≤ 𝑦), while providers whose\nindices are larger than 𝑦 do not join the industry, thereby\nearning nothing (i.e., 𝑟𝑗 = 0, for all 𝑗 > 𝑦). The size of active\nproviders is a function of 𝑀(𝑡) and 𝑄(𝑝). Let us call 𝑦 in\nProposition 1 “the efficiency threshold” since 𝑦 sets the upper\nbound on the number of active providers, each of which\nmaintains a positive payoff. FromProposition 1 above,we also\nknow that 𝐸 = ∑𝑝𝑗=1 𝑒𝑗 is described by the following equation:\n𝐸 (𝑡) =\n2𝑦𝐾\n𝑦 + 1\n−\n𝑄 (𝑦)\n(𝑦 + 1)𝑀 (𝑡)\n=\n2𝑦𝐾𝑀(𝑡) − 𝑄 (𝑦)\n(𝑦 + 1)𝑀 (𝑡)\n. (6)\nWhen all the potential providers are homogeneous (i.e., 𝑞𝑗 =\n𝑞, for all 𝑗), their strategies will be symmetric and result in a\nsymmetric Nash equilibrium as follows.\nCorollary 2 (symmetric equilibrium with homogeneous\nplayers). Let one considers the situationwhere all the providers\nare homogeneous in the sense of 𝑞𝑗 = 𝑞, for all j ∈ N. Suppose\nthat the following inequality holds; that is, 2𝑀(𝑡)𝐾(𝑡) > 𝑞.\nThen, at a symmetric equilibrium, all the potential providers\njoin the market and exercise the same marketing effort 𝑒\ndetermined as follows:\n𝑒𝑗 = 𝑒 =\n2\n𝑁 + 1\n(𝐾 −\n𝑞\n2𝑀 (𝑡)\n) ∀𝑗 ∈ N. (7)\nProof. Omitted (for proof, see Kim’s study [27]).\nIn the case of homogeneous players, we have much\nsimpler expressions for the equilibrium strategies as above.\nFirst note that all the homogeneous players join themarket or\nleave the market at the same time.Thus, 𝑦(𝑡) in Proposition 1\nwill be either 0 or𝑁, which establishes a key difference from\nthe case of heterogeneous players.With the same𝐾 and𝑀(𝑡),\nthe marketing effort of a heterogeneous active player (𝑒𝑗) will\nbe higher than that of a homogeneous player (𝑒) in general\n(Of course, the marketing effort of a heterogeneous player\nclose to the marginal provider may be lower than 𝑒). The\ntotal marketing efforts in the homogeneous case amount to\n𝑁𝑒. Subsequently, if 𝑁𝑞 < 𝑄(𝑦), then the total marketing\nefforts in the homogeneous case are larger than those in\nthe heterogeneous case. If they are not, however, one cannot\nuniformly determine the size comparison; it depends on the\ndistribution of 𝑞𝑗’s.\n3. Dynamic Model and Analysis\n3.1. Dynamic Model. Now, we will extend the basic model\ntogether with its context from a new dynamic perspective.\nThe analytical results above have been derived under the\nassumption that a certain number of providers (𝑝 providers)\nalready exist in the industry and the market maturity factor\n𝑀 is given and fixed. However, these two parameters (𝑝\nand 𝑀) should also change in their turn after the agent\nbehaviors (here, e.g., the best efforts 𝑒𝑗’s in the Nash equilibrium)\nare determined. Our dynamic model will reflect these\ninteractions betweenparameters and endogenous variables in\nthe basic model. In particular, we incorporate the dynamics\ndescribed below.\nFirst note that it is natural as well as practical to set up\nthe circumstances where the (potential) providers know only\nthe parameter values in the last period. If this is the case, then\nthe active providers try to predict the totalmarketing efforts𝐸\nand adjust their marketing efforts 𝑒𝑗’s, which optimizes their\nnet benefits and results in nonnegative payoffs. However,\ntheir expectations and decisions do not always succeed, and\nsome providers may receive negative payoffs at the end of\nthe corresponding period. Those who experience a negative\npayoff in the current period will leave the industry in the\nnext period. On the other hand, all the active providers enjoy\npositive payoffs at 𝑡 and some potential providers inactive at\n𝑡 will try to join the market at 𝑡 + 1.\nAccording to Proposition 1 with given 𝐾 and 𝑀(𝑡) at\n𝑡, 𝑦 sets the maximum number of the active providers, each\nof which earns nonnegative payoff from positive marketing\nefforts. Though the relationship between 𝑦 and other parameters\nis implicitly determined, for a particular 𝑞𝑗 distribution\nsuch as 𝑞𝑗 = ℎ⋅𝑗 (i.e.,marketing effort costs linearly increasing\nwith a positive constant ℎ), we can explicitly determine 𝑦 as a\nfunction of𝑀(𝑡) and 𝑃(𝑡); for example, with the 𝑞𝑗 specified\nabove, 𝑄(𝑝) = (𝑝(𝑝 + 1)/2)ℎ and 𝑦 = ⌊(2𝐾𝑀/ℎ(𝑝 + 1)) +\n(𝑝/2)⌋ = ⌊(4𝐾𝑀+ℎ𝑝(𝑝+1))/2ℎ(𝑝+1)⌋, where ⌊𝑥⌋ rounds 𝑥\ndown to the nearest integer. Furthermore, by pretending that\n𝑦 is continuous rather thandiscrete, one can approximate𝑦(𝑡)\nand, by plugging 𝑄(𝑝) into (6), one can approximate 𝐸(𝑡) as\nfollows:\n𝑦 (𝑡) ≅\n2𝐾𝑀(𝑡)\nℎ𝑃 (𝑡)\n+\n𝑃 (𝑡)\n2\n, (8a)\n𝐸 (𝑡) ≅ 2𝐾 −\nℎ\n2\n4𝐾\n{\n𝑃 (𝑡)\n𝑀 (𝑡)\n}\n2\n. (8b)\nWe establish a set of dynamics driven by both the market\nmaturity factor𝑀(𝑡) and the number of active providers𝑃(𝑡).\nThat is, as a result of individual decisions of whether to join\nthe market or not, both 𝑀(𝑡) and 𝑃(𝑡) are endogenously\ndetermined by the following systems of difference equations.\nWe employ a set of adaptive dynamics where 𝛼 and 𝛽\nrepresent the weights associated with the current states of the\nactive players and themarketmaturity, respectively. Consider\n𝑃 (𝑡 + 1) = {𝛼𝑃 (𝑡) + (1 − 𝛼) (𝑦 (𝑡) − 𝑃 (𝑡)) ∧ 𝑁} ∨ 0, (9a)\n𝑀(𝑡 + 1) = {𝛽𝑀 (𝑡) + (1 − 𝛽) (𝐾 − 𝐸 (𝑡)) ∧ 𝑀max} ∨ 0,\n(9b)\nwhere 𝑥 ∧ 𝑦 = min{𝑥, 𝑦}, 𝑥 ∨ 𝑦 = max{𝑥, 𝑦}, and 𝑀max\nrepresents the maximum level of𝑀(𝑡).\nPlugging ((8a) and (8b)) into ((9a) and (9b)) and rearranging\nthe terms, we establish the systems of the following\ndynamic equations:\n𝑃 (𝑡 + 1) = {𝛼𝑃 (𝑡) + (1 − 𝛼) [\n2𝐾𝑀(𝑡)\nℎ𝑃 (𝑡)\n−\n𝑃 (𝑡)\n2\n]\n∧𝑁} ∨ 0,\n(10a)\n', 'Journal of Applied Mathematics 5\n𝑀(𝑡 + 1) = {𝛽𝑀(𝑡) + (1 − 𝛽)𝐾[(\nℎ𝑃 (𝑡)\n2𝐾𝑀(𝑡)\n)\n2\n− 1]\n∧ 𝑀max} ∨ 0.\n(10b)\nEquation (10a) explains the changes in the number of active\nproviders. The size of active providers in the next period\n𝑃(𝑡+1)will increase if the current𝑃(𝑡) is smaller than𝑦(𝑡), the\nefficiency threshold (i.e., the maximum number of efficient\nproviders). On the other hand, 𝑃(𝑡 + 1) will decrease if the\ncurrent number of providers exceeds this threshold since\nsome providers (most likely the ones with low marketing\ncapabilities or high marketing costs) will experience a loss,\nthereby leaving the industry next time. Lastly, the adaptive\ndynamics are completed with 𝛼 as the associated weight.\nEquation (10b) also follows the similar reasoning as in (10a).\nIt represents the adaptive adjustment process of 𝑀(𝑡) (with\n𝛽 as its associated weight) when the current total marketing\nlevel 𝐸(𝑡) fails to hit the optimal level of marketing efforts 𝐾.\nIf the totalmarketing efforts from the current active providers\nexceed (in the case of excessive marketing), the market is\noverexploited and𝑀(𝑡 + 1) decreases.\nAccording to the systemdynamics described in ((10a) and\n(10b)), a change in 𝑀(𝑡) affects the market value 𝐺(𝑡) (refer\nto (1)), which in turn influences the gains of the providers.\nAs a result, some incumbent players exit or some new players\nenter the industry in the next period, and eventually the total\nmarketing efforts are highly likely to vary. Thus, the possible\ndifference in the speeds of the adjustments may result in a\nfluctuation in the number of providers, whichmay hinder the\nsystem from settling down to a steady state in the long-run.\nWe will investigate this possibility together with the system\nperformance such as the deviation of the total marketing\nefforts from the socially optimal level of the marketing.\n3.2. Dynamic Analysis. Let us first define a positive constant\nΦ ≡ √𝐾2 + (4/3)ℎ − 𝐾 to simplify the expressions hereafter.\nProposition 3 shows an interior fixed point from the system\ndynamics. Proposition 4 provides the conditions that the\ninterior fixed point (if exists) is stable or unstable.\nProposition 3. Suppose that both 𝛼 and 𝛽 belong to (0, 1).The\nfollowing state (𝑃,𝑀) gives an interior fixed point of the system\ndynamics in ((10a) and (10b)):\n𝑀 =\nΦ\n2\n, 𝑃 = √\n2𝐾Φ\n3ℎ\n. (11)\nProof. The interior equilibrium comes from the solution of\nthe following simultaneous equation system:\n𝑃 = 𝛼𝑃 + (1 − 𝛼) [\n2𝐾𝑀\nℎ𝑃\n−\n𝑃\n2\n] ,\n𝑀 = 𝛽𝑀 + (1 − 𝛽)𝐾[(\nℎ𝑃\n2𝐾𝑀\n)\n2\n− 1] .\n(12)\nBy rearranging the two equations in terms of 𝑃 and𝑀, we get\n3\n2\n𝑃\n2\n−\n2𝐾\nℎ\n𝑀 = 0, 𝑀\n3\n+ 𝐾𝑀\n2\n−\nℎ\n2\n4𝐾\n𝑃\n2\n= 0. (13)\nPlugging the first equation into the second and rearranging\nthe terms, we get\n𝑀(𝑀\n2\n+ 𝐾𝑀 −\nℎ\n3\n) = 0. (14)\nThus, either 𝑀 = 0 or 𝑀 = Φ/2 provides the solution\nto the equation above. However, the first solution does not\nconstitute an interior point (refer to Proposition 5). On the\nother hand, the second solution is indeed positive (∵ Φ > 0)\nand constitutes the interior equilibriumabove.𝑃 in (11) comes\nfrom the relationship (3/2)𝑃2 = (2𝐾/ℎ)𝑀 above.\nProposition 4. Suppose that 9Φ4 − 6Φ2 − 64ℎ2 > 0 and\n(16/15)ℎ < 𝐾\n2. If 𝛼 < (5/3) − ((1 + 𝛽)Φ2/4ℎ(1 − 𝛽))\nand 𝛽 < (20ℎ − 3Φ2)/(20ℎ + 3Φ2), then the fixed point in\nProposition 3 is unstable.\nProof. In this proof, we suppress the time index 𝑡 for\nenhanced readability. We first consider linear approximation\nof the dynamics around the interior equilibrium. Applying\nthe Taylor approximation to ((10a) and (10b)), we get the\nfollowing matrix that governs the dynamics around an\narbitrary point in the state space:\n[\n[\n[\n3𝛼 − 1\n2\n−\n2𝐾 (1 − 𝛼)\nℎ\n⋅\n𝑀\n𝑃2\n2𝐾 (1 − 𝛼)\nℎ\n⋅\n1\n𝑃\nℎ\n2\n(1 − 𝛽)\n2𝐾\n⋅\n𝑃\n𝑀2\n𝛽 −\nℎ\n2\n(1 − 𝛽)\n2𝐾\n⋅\n𝑃\n2\n𝑀3\n]\n]\n]\n. (15)\nIn particular, the matrix reduces to the following one around\nthe interior fixed point (𝑃,𝑀):\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n1 (1 − 𝛼)√\n6𝐾\nℎΦ\n(1 − 𝛽)√\n1\n3𝐾\n⋅ (\n2ℎ\nΦ\n)\n3\n𝛽 +\n4ℎ (1 − 𝛽)\n3𝐾Φ − 2ℎ\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n. (16)\nNote that (3/2)Φ2 = 2ℎ − 3𝐾Φ. Then, the characteristic\nequation of the matrix above comes as follows:\n𝜆\n2\n+ (\n8ℎ (1 − 𝛽)\n3Φ2\n− 1 − 𝛽)𝜆 + 𝛽\n+\n4ℎ (1 − 𝛽) (3𝛼 − 5)\n3Φ2\n= 𝜆\n2\n+ Θ𝜆 + Ω = 0,\n(17)\n', '6 Journal of Applied Mathematics\nwhere Θ ≡ (8ℎ(1 − 𝛽)/3Φ2) − 1 − 𝛽 and Ω ≡ 𝛽 + (4ℎ(1 −\n𝛽)(3𝛼 − 5)/3Φ\n2\n) denote two constants for simplification of\nthe following expressions. The condition that the equation\nhas two distinctive real roots 𝜆1 and 𝜆2 is Θ\n2\n> 4Ω, which\nis summarized as below by a chain of arithmetic operations:\n64ℎ\n2\n(1 − 𝛽)\n2\n+ 9Φ\n4\n(1 + 𝛽)\n2\n> 12Φ\n2\n{4ℎ (1 − 𝛽) (1 + 𝛽) + 𝛽}\n+ 16ℎ (1 − 𝛽) (3𝛼 − 5) .\n(18)\nSince the second term (the last term) in the right-hand side\nis negative, it suffices that 64ℎ2(1 − 𝛽)2 + 9Φ4(1 + 𝛽)2 >\n12Φ\n2\n{4ℎ(1−𝛽)(1+𝛽)+𝛽} holds. Applying another arithmetic\noperation and collecting terms reorganize this relation as\nfollows:\n(3Φ\n2\n+ 8ℎ)\n2\n𝛽\n2\n− 2 (64ℎ\n2\n− 9Φ\n4\n+ 6Φ\n2\n) 𝛽 + (3Φ\n2\n− 8ℎ)\n2\n> 0.\n(19)\nTherefore, if 9Φ4 − 6Φ2 − 64ℎ2 > 0, then the inequality above\nholds and the characteristic equation has two distinctive real\nsolutions.\nNow, using the facts that 𝜆1 + 𝜆2 = −Θ and 𝜆1𝜆2 = Ω,\nwe can find sufficient conditions which establish stability or\ninstability of the interior equilibrium. Indeed, if 𝜆1𝜆2 < −1,\nthen at least one eigenvalue is larger than 1 or less than −1,\nthereby making the system around the interior fixed point\nunstable. Since 𝜆1𝜆2 = Ω = 𝛽 + 4ℎ(1 − 𝛽)(3𝛼 − 5)/3Φ\n2, the\ncondition 𝜆1𝜆2 < −1 reduces into the following inequalities:\n3𝛽Φ\n2\n+ 4ℎ (1 − 𝛽) (3𝛼 − 5) < −3Φ\n2\nor 𝛼 < 5\n3\n−\n(1 + 𝛽)Φ\n2\n4ℎ (1 − 𝛽)\n.\n(20)\nThe right-hand side of the inequality for 𝛼 is positive if\n𝛽 < (20ℎ − 3Φ\n2\n)/(20ℎ + 3Φ\n2\n). The right-hand side of\nthe inequality for 𝛽 is also positive under the condition of\n(16/15)ℎ < 𝐾\n2. Thus, two conditions pertaining to 𝛼 and 𝛽\nare well established as a sufficient condition for the interior\nequilibrium to be unstable, which completes the proof.\nThe proof needs to be complemented since Proposition 4\nprovides only a sufficient condition. We know that if |𝜆1 +\n𝜆2| < 1 and 𝜆1𝜆2 > 0 then all the eigenvalues are less than\n1, thereby making the system around the interior fixed point\nstable. However, one can show in a similar way that there is\nno 𝜆𝑖 that satisfies those conditions. Indeed, since 𝜆1 + 𝜆2 =\n−Θ = 1 + 𝛽 − (8ℎ(1 − 𝛽)/3Φ\n2\n), the condition |𝜆1 + 𝜆2| < 1\nreduces to (6𝐾Φ/(6ℎ − 3𝐾Φ)) < 𝛽 < (4ℎ/(6ℎ − 3𝐾Φ)).\nOn the other hand, the condition 𝜆1𝜆2 = Ω > 0 reduces\nto 𝛼 > (5/3) − (𝛽Φ2/4ℎ(1 − 𝛽)) and 𝛽 > (4ℎ/(6ℎ − 3𝐾Φ)),\nwhich cannot be compatible with the previous condition. A\nsimilar type of incompatibility occurs in the case of 𝜆1𝜆2 >\n1. This possibility of instability is also frustrated since the\nX\nX\n1\n1\nX\nX\n−1\n−1 𝜆1\n𝜆2\nFigure 1: Regions of the 𝜆1-𝜆2 space: explored and unexplored.\ncondition 𝜆1𝜆2 > 1 requires either 𝛼 > 1 or 𝛽 > 1, which\nis not acceptable. As a result, we have explored the following\nregions of the 𝜆1-𝜆2 space in Figure 1. The shaded regions\nwith “𝑋” mark are the subsets whose (𝜆1, 𝜆2)-tuples cannot\nbe realized in our model. The two hatched regions depict the\nsufficient conditions in this proposition. Thus, Proposition 4\nleaves some regions unexplored.\nProposition 3 reveals that there is a unique interior\nequilibrium if any one exists. Proposition 4, however, implies\nthat the interior equilibrium is highly likely unstable.Though\nthere remain some regions that should be explored in the\n𝜆1-𝜆2 space (see Figure 1), it may not be a good strategy to\ninvestigate the stability regions first, with a vague hope to\ndiscover such a case. In fact, it seems hard to find an instance\nin which the interior equilibrium is stable (refer to some\nexperimental results in Section 5). And if this is true, one\nneeds to analyze another possibility and different aspects of\nthe dynamics.\nSince the 𝑃(𝑡)-𝑀(𝑡) state space is bounded, the system\ndynamics may have a boundary equilibrium that needs to\nbe investigated. Obviously, for example, (0, 0) cannot be a\nboundary fixed point which represents a complete collapse\nof both market and industry (Also note that the dynamic\nequations ((10a) and (10b)) are not defined at (0, 0)).However,\nthe system state may approach the origin very closely (refer\nto the proposition below and the discussions in the next\nsection). Furthermore, neither (𝑧, 0) with any positive 𝑧 ∈\n(0,𝑁] nor (0, 𝑧)with 𝑧 ∈ (0,𝑀max] can be aNash equilibrium\nsince, at least for a (potential) player, a deviation from the\ncorresponding state improves its gain. For example, an active\nplayer at (𝑁, 0) will be better off if it leaves the market and\navoids a negative payoff.The following proposition deals with\nthe other types of possible boundary equilibria.\nProposition 5. The following two states are (near) boundary\nfixed point equilibria (compatible with the static model as in\n', 'Journal of Applied Mathematics 7\nProposition 1). However, both are unstable under the certain\nconditions (if any) specified below.\n(i) For an arbitrary small 𝜀, (𝜀, 𝜀) is a near boundary Nash\nequilibrium. However, (𝜀, 𝜀) is unstable if ℎ > 2𝐾.\n(ii) (𝑁,𝑀max) is a boundary Nash equilibrium if 𝑞𝑁 ≤\n(2𝐾𝑀max/(𝑁 + 1)) + (𝑁/2). However, (𝑁,𝑀max)\nis unstable if 4𝐾𝑀max < 3ℎ𝑁2 and ℎ2𝑁2 <\n4𝐾𝑀\n2\nmax(𝐾 +𝑀max).\nProof. It is easy to show that the two states asserted\nabove become Nash equilibria in the sense compatible with\nProposition 1. For 𝜀 is very close to 0, for example, (𝜀, 𝜀) ≈\n(0, 0) implies that any potential provider (even the most\nefficient provider) outside of the industry cannot expect\nany positive gain from joining the industry. Thus, the best\nresponse of all the providers is to stay out of the industry.\nSimilarly, in the other extreme cases of (𝑁,𝑀max), where\nall the providers join the industry, even the least efficient\nprovider enjoys a positive gain from performing as much\nmarketing effort as determined by Proposition 1 if 𝑞𝑁 ≤\n(2𝐾𝑀max/(𝑁+ 1)) + (𝑁/2). Therefore, no provider will leave\nthe industry and𝑀max is sustained.\nIn order to show the instability of (𝜀, 𝜀), we first apply the\nTaylor expansion to 𝑃(𝑡 + 1) − 𝑃(𝑡) and 𝑀(𝑡 + 1) − 𝑀(𝑡) at\n(𝜀, 𝜀) and get\n𝑃 (𝑡 + 1) − 𝑃 (𝑡)\n= (1 − 𝛼) {(\n2𝐾\nℎ𝜀\n−\n3\n2\n)𝑃 (𝑡) +\n2𝐾\nℎ𝜀\n𝑀 (𝑡) +\n2𝐾\nℎ\n} −\n𝛼𝜀\n2\n(21a)\n𝑀(𝑡 + 1) −𝑀 (𝑡)\n= (1 − 𝛽)\n× {\nℎ\n2\n2𝐾𝜀\n𝑃 (𝑡) − (1 +\nℎ\n2\n2𝐾𝜀\n)𝑀(𝑡) +\nℎ\n2\n4𝐾\n− 𝐾} + 𝜀.\n(21b)\nNow, we incorporate a small perturbation around (𝜀, 𝜀) into\n((21a) and (21b)). We will show that, for at least one type of\nperturbation, both𝑃(𝑡+1)−𝑃(𝑡) and𝑀(𝑡+1)−𝑀(𝑡) become\npositive, which means that the system state grows apart from\nthe near boundary equilibrium (𝜀, 𝜀). For example, we take\ninto account a small perturbation in a north-east direction\nsuch as (𝜀 + 𝜀1, 𝜀 + 𝜀2) where both 𝜀1 and 𝜀2 are positive\nand sufficiently small. Then, after a series of arranging and\ncollecting terms, ((21a) and (21b)) reduce as follows:\n𝑃 (𝑡 + 1) − 𝑃 (𝑡)\n=\n2𝐾 (1 − 𝛼)\nℎ\n(3 +\n𝜀1 + 𝜀2\n𝜀\n) + (𝛼 −\n3\n2\n) 𝜀 +\n3\n2\n(𝛼 − 1) 𝜀1\n(22a)\n𝑀(𝑡 + 1) −𝑀 (𝑡)\n= (1 − 𝛽){\nℎ\n2\n2𝐾\n(\n𝜀1 − 𝜀2\n𝜀\n+\n1\n2\n) − 𝐾} + 𝛽 (𝜀 + 𝜀2) − 𝜀2.\n(22b)\nThefirst term in the right-hand side of (22a) is always positive\nand the other two terms are arbitrary small enough for the\noverall magnitude of 𝑃(𝑡 + 1) − 𝑃(𝑡) to be positive. If 𝜀1 > 𝜀2\nand the condition in (i) holds, then the first two terms in the\nright-hand side of (22b) are positive. Thus, there are many\ndirections in the north-east area of (𝜀, 𝜀) along which both\n𝑃(𝑡+1)−𝑃(𝑡) and𝑀(𝑡+1)−𝑀(𝑡) become positive (One can\nalso prove that both (21a) and (21b) lead to a divergence from\n(𝜀, 𝜀) in the other areas, e.g., a south-east direction of (𝜀, 𝜀)).\nOne can apply a similar procedure to the case of the\nboundary equilibrium (𝑁,𝑀max). First, the dynamics around\n(𝑁,𝑀max) can be written as follows:\n𝑃 (𝑡 + 1) − 𝑃 (𝑡)\n= (𝛼 − 1) {(\n3\n2\n+\n2𝐾𝑀max\nℎ𝑁2\n)𝑃 (𝑡)\n−\n2𝐾\nℎ𝑁\n𝑀(𝑡) −\n2𝐾𝑀max\nℎ𝑁\n}\n(23a)\n𝑀(𝑡 + 1) −𝑀 (𝑡)\n= (1 − 𝛽){\nℎ\n2\n𝑁\n2𝐾𝑀2max\n𝑃 (𝑡) − (1 +\nℎ\n2\n𝑁\n2\n2𝐾𝑀3max\n)𝑀(𝑡)\n+\nℎ\n2\n𝑁\n2\n4𝐾𝑀2max\n− 𝐾} .\n(23b)\nTo determine its stability, we again evaluate a small perturbation\naround (𝑁,𝑀max). In this case, however, one needs\nto examine only one direction of perturbation, that is, (𝑁 −\n𝜀,𝑀max − 𝜀), where 𝜀 is positive and sufficiently small. After a\nseries of operations, ((23a) and (23b)) reduce as follows:\n𝑃 (𝑡 + 1) − 𝑃 (𝑡)\n= (1 − 𝛼) {\n4𝐾𝑀max − 3ℎ𝑁\n2\n2ℎ𝑁\n+(\n2𝐾 (𝑀max − 𝑁)\nℎ𝑁2\n+\n3\n2\n) 𝜀}\n(24a)\n𝑀(𝑡 + 1) −𝑀 (𝑡)\n= (1 − 𝛽){\nℎ\n2\n𝑁\n2\n4𝐾𝑀2max\n−𝑀max − 𝐾\n+(\nℎ\n2\n𝑁(𝑁 −𝑀max)\n2𝐾𝑀3max\n+ 1) 𝜀} .\n(24b)\nNote that the last terms in the respective right-hand side of\n((24a) and (24b)) are to be arbitrary small. Thus, the signs of\n', '8 Journal of Applied Mathematics\n𝑃(𝑡+1)−𝑃(𝑡) and𝑀(𝑡+1)−𝑀(𝑡) are determined by their first\nterms, each of which is negative if the conditions in (ii) hold.\nAs a result, both 𝑃(𝑡 + 1) − 𝑃(𝑡) and𝑀(𝑡 + 1) −𝑀(𝑡) become\nnegative, which establishes the instability of (𝑁,𝑀max).\nFirst note that the near boundary equilibrium (𝜀, 𝜀) represents\na virtual collapse of the market as well as the industry.\nOn the other hand, the boundary equilibrium (𝑁,𝑀max)\nrepresents a perfect prosperity of the business ecosystem.\nThus, the stability analysis about those two boundary states\nsuggests not only good news but also bad news. The good\nnews is that as both the market force and the number of\nproviders approach nil, at least a tiny fraction of providers still\nseize the opportunity to earn positive gains, which would in\nturn boost the market demand. This mechanism of escaping\nfrom almost complete destruction comes from the structural\nproperty of the dynamics that would not allow nil to be as a\nfixed point.\nOn the other hand, the instability of the complete\nprosperity presents a bad news. As shown in the proof, a\nsmall perturbation occurring around the boundary state may\nlead the system away from the ideal situation. This system\nbehavior probably comes from the mechanism around the\nsaturation state (𝑁,𝑀max). That is, with a shock making the\nsystem deviate from the saturation, some marginal providers\non the limit of positive gain at the saturation now would\nexperience a loss and leave the industry.This reduction of the\nnumber of providers is highly likely to cut back the market\nvalue, which would in turn disturb more providers on the\nverge of leaving the industry.\nThese results suggest that 𝑃(𝑡) and 𝑀(𝑡) which are\nsufficiently small [or close to their respect upper bounds]\nmay approach the origin [or the saturation] over time but\nsuddenly explodes near the origin [or shrink back near\nthe saturation]. Thus, the stability analysis so far hints a\npossible cyclic solution to our dynamics. We will check out\nthis possibility through numerical experiments in the next\nsection.\nEven though it is true that our system behavior has the\nproperty of natural resilience from deterioration, it may stay\nat the states near a collapse over a long period of time. Thus,\nwe need to develop a policy measure that protects the system\nfrom moving toward the collapse and establishes a locally\nstable positive equilibrium that attracts system trajectories\ngenerated around it. If it is successful, the market and the\nindustry will not only be sustained but also stabilized over\ntime at some desirable states. We will also deal with this issue\nin the next section.\n4. Experiments and Discussions\nWe conduct some numerical simulations in order to examine\nmore thoroughly the system behaviors in various scenarios.\nIn our simulations, both 𝑃(𝑡) and 𝑀(𝑡) are endogenously\ndetermined according to the system dynamics presented in\nthe previous section. Subsequently, the totalmarketing efforts\nare also changing as the system states vary, which provides a\nsharp contrast with the theoretical results in the static model\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\nP(t)\nM\n(t\n)\nFigure 2: Experimental example. Here, 𝛼 = 0.7, 𝛽 = 0.9, 𝐾 = 10,\nand ℎ = 1. The initial point is 𝑃0 = 70 and𝑀0 = 50 with 𝑁 = 100\nand 𝑀 = 100. Arrows show the directions of the migration of the\nsystem state. The system state moves toward the origin after leaving\nthe initial point. Interestingly, however, there is a loop starting from\nnear the origin. The presence of the loops implies a cycle in the\nsystem behavior.\nsuch asKim’s study [27] (This finding (and the followings) can\nbe captured only in a dynamic setting).\nAs Propositions 3 to 5 reveal, the outcomes of the dynamic\nmodel are quite different from the ones of the static model\ndescribed in Proposition 1. First of all, note that (𝜀, 𝜀), close\nto a complete collapse of the market and the industry, is not a\nstable equilibrium, but the system is highly likely to approach\nthe origin.Thus, ToC (the tragedy of the commons) seems to\nbe inevitable in some situations, particularly when themarket\nis not mature (i.e., small𝑀0) with many providers (i.e., large\n𝑃0). Figure 2 depicts this possibility.\nAs raised in the previous section, a cycle or a sequence of\nperiodic points seems to constitute a solution to our dynamic\nequations. In fact, the emergence of the ToC trap and the\noscillation dynamics are neither a new phenomenon nor an\nunusual feature in dynamic models, particularly on the basis\nof structured interactions among agents (e.g., Perc and Szolnoki\n[21], Perc et al. [22], and Santos et al. [23]) (In particular,\nthe emergence of cycles (or oscillations) has been observed in\nthe context of adaptive networks (Szolnoki and Perc [24, 25])\nand with three competing strategies (Szolnoki et al. [28]), as\nwell as under a presence of punishment (Szolnoki et al. [29])\nor a reward (Szolnoki and Perc [26]). However, our model\ndoes not assume a structured population; it is one of our\nfuture research topics to incorporate organized interactions\namongproviders (see also our comment in the futureworks)).\nIt is also well known that finding such a cycle is usually a very\ndifficult task, and our model is no exception. However, our\nnumerical experiments including the one above confirm (or\nat least indicate) that the cyclic solution commonly occurs\nfor many initial states. For example, the experiment outcome\n', 'Journal of Applied Mathematics 9\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\nP(t)\nM\n(t\n)\nFigure 3: A cycle example.

Here, all the parameters and the initial states remain the same as the ones in Figure 2 for (a)\nand Figure 3 for (b). The time series graphs of 𝑃(𝑡) and𝑀(𝑡) also clearly point out the cyclic pattern of the system behavior even though they\nlook a little different in the first period due to different starting points. In both instances, the total marketing efforts 𝐸(𝑡) are higher than their\noptimal level 𝐾most of the time.\ndepicted in Figure 3 shows a clear cycle of the particular\ndynamics specified in Figure 2 (except the initial point). In\nthis instance, the initial state is deliberately set to (𝑃0,𝑀0) =\n(40, 70), which closely lies on the cycle observed in Figure 2.\nMoreover, Figure 4 represents the system behavior along\nthe timeline. They show clear cycles repeating over time. In\nmost of time, the total marketing efforts remain higher than\nthe optimal level 𝐾. Thus, the market maturity eventually\ndrops down to almost zero, which in turn results in deterioration\nof providers’ gain, that is, the ToC trap. Whenever the\nmarket maturity approaches nil, most efficient few providers\nsurvive and are able to sweep all the gains from the market.\nThanks to the monopolized benefits, they can boost the\nmarket and the maturity rapidly increases. This explosion of\nthe market opportunity attracts more providers, and the new\ncycle starts thereafter.\nIf this is the most common case then the remaining issue\nshould be related to the ToC trap which seems inevitable\nin the cycle. In particular, we need to develop a remedy\n(a policy measure) to cope with ToC. One possible way to\npursue is to introduce a regulation that makes providers\nkeep themarketing efforts at their reasonable levels (probably\ncoupled with their cost efficiencies). We may also implement\na policy that puts some barriers to preserve a minimum level\nof the market maturity. Figure 5 shows the effect of the latter\napproach. One may consider a similar barrier set up for 𝑃(𝑡)\n', '10 Journal of Applied Mathematics\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0 2010 4030 6050 8070\nP(t)\nM\n(t\n)\nWhen a policy enforced:\nset a barrier to preserve\na minimum level of M\nFigure 5: Experimental example, with a barrier to sustain the\nmarket. Here, all the parameters and the initial states remain\nthe same as the ones in Figure 2 (but the axes have been scaled\ndifferently). In addition, however, there is a barrier set up for the\nmarket maturity.This barrier keeps the market maturity factor𝑀(𝑡)\nabove 10. Arrows show the directions of the migration of the system\nstate, which settles down to a fixed state, of which𝑀(𝑡) corresponds\nto the barrier. In this instance, there is no cycle.\nand compare the outcomes of two approaches in terms of\nsocial welfare (As a matter of fact, we also tried this approach\nbut omitted the results here since the outcomes of this policy\ndo not seem to follow a rule; they produce nonstructured\nmany small cycles. Thus, apparently (not rigorously), the\npolicy to sustain at least a certain number of providers fails\nin providing better outcomes).\n5. Conclusion and Future Works\nThis study examined the possibilities of a disruption of a\nbusiness ecosystem, so-called the ToC trap, which describes\nthe situation where the total marketing efforts 𝐸 exceed\ntheir socially optimal level 𝐾. Not only the interior but also\nthe boundary equilibria were found and analyzed for their\nstability.We also conducted somenumerical experiments and\ndiscovered cycles as solutions to some particular instances.\nSince those cycles contain the ToC traps, we simulated a\npolicy measure to maintain a minimum level of market\nmaturity and checked out the effectiveness of the policy. Even\nthough we had in mind some ICT industries (e.g., the social\ncommerce industry) with fierce marketing competition, our\napproach and results will not be confined to the ICT industries.\nAnd we hope this study helps to find a clue to avoid\nthe ToC trap, thereby shedding new light on the sustainable\ngrowth of business ecosystems.\nHowever, the analytical results and implications have\nbeen established on the basis of our modeling assumptions,\nand they may not be generalized into all the situations. In\nparticular, our assumption of perfectly mixed (or randomized)\ninteractions among the players is not a fully realistic\none. This remains as one of the limitations of our model and\napproach. Thus, it will be an obviously interesting direction\nof our next research step to extend the proposed game model\nwith a structured population of providers (for benchmarking\nstudies, refer to Szolnoki et al. [28], Szolnoki et al. [29], and\nWang et al. [30]).\nIn our future works, we will also refine policy measures\nthat were derived in the course of implementing our\nsuggestions to alleviate the risk of the ToC trap. We will\nincorporate various regulatory schemes and other policy\nideas (e.g., Greely [31]) and evaluate their effects on the longrun\nequilibrium. Lastly, we will compare the policy outcomes\nwith one generated from a hypothetical social planner who\ndetermines the total marketing level that optimizes the entire\nmarket value. Case studies together with statistical analysis\nwill be conducted in order to test these possibilities in practice\nand to investigate the effects of the parameters on expected\nresults.\nConflict of Interests\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] D.
