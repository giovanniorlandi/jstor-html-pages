        <pre>['AN ANTI-CHRISTIAN WAR 129\nthe three soldiers who were serving it, \nand then was seen “ fighting and laying \no u t” the Germans with the butt end of \nhis empty gun, “ laughing ” as he did so, \nuntil he fell mortally wounded in the \nbody and was carried away by his ser\xad\nvant.\nHis patient and heroic end is told by \nPrivate Derry, and I imagine that the \nexhortation to “  Stick it, Welsh! ” which \nfrom time to time he uttered in his \nagony, will not soon be forgotten in his \nregiment. Of that end we who mourn \nhim can only say in the simple words of \nDerry’s letter, that he “  died as he had \nlived— an officer and a gentleman.”\nPerhaps it would not be inappropriate \nto add as a thought of consolation to \nthose throughout the land who day by\nday see their loved ones thus devoured \nby the waste of war, that of a truth these \ndo not vainly die. Not only are they \ncrowned with fame, but by the noble \nmanner of their end they give the lie to \nBernhardi and his school, who tell us that \nwe English are an effete and worn-out \npeople, befogged with mean ideals; lost \nin selfishness and the lust of wealth and \ncomfort. Moreover, the history of these \ndeeds of theirs will surely,be as a beacon \nto those destined to carry on the tradi\xad\ntions of our race in that new England \nwhich shall arise when the cause of free\xad\ndom for which we must fight and die \nhas prevailed— to fall no more.\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\nH. EIDER HAGGARD.\nDitchingham, Norfolk, Oct. 9.\nAn Anti-Christian War\nB y  R obert B rid g es.\nTo the E ditor.of The  [ London] Times:\nSir: Since the beginning of this war the \nmeaning of it has in one respect consid\xad\nerably changed, and I hope that our peo\xad\nple will see that it is primarily a holy \nwar. It is manifestly a war declared be\xad\ntween Christ and the devil.\nThe conduct of the German conscripts \nhas demonstrated that they have been \ninstructed to adopt in full practice the \ntheories of their political philosophers, \nand that they have heartily consented to \ndo this and freely commit every cruelty \nthat they think will terrorize the peo\xad\nple whom they intend to crush. The de\xad\ntails of their actions are too beastly to \nmention.\nTheir philosophers, as I read them, \nteach openly that the law of love is silly \nand useless, but that brutal force and \ncruelty are the useful and proper means \nof attaining success in all things. \nShortly, you are not to do to others as \nyou wish they should do to you, but \nyou should do exactly what you wish \nthey should not do to you; that is, you\nshould cut their throats and seize their \nproperty, and then you will get on.\nAs for these enlightened philosophers, \ntheir doctrines are plainly an apostasy \nfrom the Gospel— and this they do not \nscruple to avow; and their tenets are \nonly a recrudescence or reassertion of \nthe barbarism which we hoped we had \ngrown out of; it is all merely damnable. \nBut it seems to me that, judged only as \nutilitarian policy, it is stupid; and that \nthey blundered in neglecting the moral \nforce (for that is also a force) of the \nantagonism that they were bound to \narouse in all gentle minds, whether \nsimple or cultured. It was stupid of \nthem not to perceive that, t.heir hellish \nprinciples would shock everything that \nis most beloved and living in modern \nthought, both the “  humanitarian ” ten\xad\ndency of the time and the respect which \nhas grown up for the rights of minorities \nand nationalities. Now, not to reckon \nwith such things was stupid, unless they \ncan win temporary justification by im\xad\nmediate success,\n', '130 THE NEW YORK TIMES CURRENT HISTORY OF THE WAR\nWhat success is possible for those who \nthus openly outrage humanity remains \nto be seen; but they cannot be allowed \nthe advantage of any doubt as to what \nthey are about. Those who fight for \nthem will fight for “ the devil and all his \nworks” ; and those who fight against \nthem will be fighting in the holy cause \nof humanity and the law of love. If the \nadvocacy of their bad principles and their \ndiabolical conduct do not set the whole \nworld against them, then the world is \nworse than I think. My belief is that \nthere are yet millions of their own coun\xad\ntrymen who have not bowed the knee to \nSatan, and who will be as much shocked \nas we are; and that this internal moral \ndisruption will much hamper them. This \nmorning I have a legal notice sent me \nfrom a German resident in England an\xad\nnouncing that he has changed his name, \nfor shame (I suppose) of his Fatherland.\nAll their apology throughout has been\na clumsy tissue of self-contradictory lies, \nand their occasional hypocrisy has been \nhastily pretended and ill-conceived. The \nparticular contention against us—that \nwe were betraying the cause of civiliza\xad\ntion by supporting the barbarous Slav— \ndoes not come very convincingly from \nthem if their apostle is Nietzsche, while \nthe Russian prophet is Tolstoy.\nThe infernal machine which has been \nscientifically preparing for the last twen\xad\nty-five years is now on its wild career \nlike one of Mr. Wells’s inventions, and \nwherever it goes it will leave desolation \nbehind it and put all material progress \nback for at least half a century. There \nwas never anything in the world worthier \nof extermination, and it is the plain duty \nof all civilized nations to unite to drive \nit back into its home and exterminate it \nthere. I am, &c.,\nROBERT BRIDGES.\nSept. 1.\nEnglish Artists’ Protest\nArt lovers in Great Britain have drawn up \na protest against the vandalism of German \nsoldiers. Copies of this protest have been \nsent to the Comte de Lalaing, Belgian Min\xad\nister in London; the American Ambassador, \nwith a humble request that it may be for- \nwarded to the President of the United States; \nand Baron Kervyn de Lettenhove, Art Ad\xad\nviser to the Belgian Government. Those who \nhave signed include well-known collectors, \nTrustees of the British Museum, the Na\xad\ntional Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, \nand the National Galleries of Scotland; the \nDirector and Principal Librarian of the Brit\xad\nish Museum; the Directors of the National \nGallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, \nand the National Galleries of Scotland and \nIreland; the Keepers of the Wallace Collec\xad\ntion and the National Gallery of British \nA rt; Keepers in the British Museum; the \nJoint Honorary Secretaries of the National \nArt Collections Fund, and many critics and \nothers prominent in the art world.\nThe whole civilized world has wit\xad\nnessed with horror the terrible effects \nof modern warfare on helpless inhabi\xad\ntants of Belgium and France, and on \nancient buildings and other works of art \nwhich are the abiding monuments of the \npiety and culture of their ancestors.\nSome of the acts of the invading Ger\xad\nman army against buildings may be de\xad\nfensible from the military standpoint; \nbut it seems certain from present infor\xad\nmation that in some signal instances, \nnotably at Louvain and Rheims, this de\xad\nfense cannot hold good against the mass \nof evidence to the contrary.\nThe signatories of this protest claim \nthat they are in no sense a partisan \nbody. Their contention in this matter \nis that the splendid monuments of the \narts of the Middle Ages which have been \ndestroyed or damaged are the inheritance \nof the whole world, and that it is the duty \nof all civilized communities to endeavor \nto preserve them for the benefit and in\xad\nstruction of posterity. While France and \nBelgium are individually the poorer from \nsuch wanton destruction, the world at \nlargo is no less impoverished.\nOn these grounds, therefore, we desire \nto express our strong indignation and \nabhorrence at the gratuitous destruction\n']</pre>
