Great Rus, sian losses, it is claimed, are due to this method of warfare., The Russian method of attack in the Bukowina and Volhy, nia, the Austrians says, consists of artillery preparation lasting, from 24 to 48 hours. Then come the first Russian infantry, troops, from six to fourteen rows, driven forward by Russian, nachine guns and by Cossacks armed with the dreaded “Naga, kas,’’ or lead-tipped whip., As they advance the Russian artillery fire abates some, what, but between it and the Austrian fire from 40 to 50 per, cent of the first troops sometimes reach the trenches. Their, arrival naturally forces the Austrians to abandon their shelters,, and as soon as they do so the Russian drumfire begins again, j, In both the Bukowina and the Volhynia offensive it is es, timated that the Russians use up about two million shells every, 24 hours — shells of Russian, Jaoanese and American make, and, thrown from every calibre of gun, including naval pieces appar, ently dismounted from warships., BIG RAILROAD STRIKE IS CALLED OFF, WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.—The brotherhoods late this af, ternoon decided to accept the eight hour bill as a basis for call, ing off the railroad strike.

The*, Include every t\\pe of craft from suf, marines to battleships, and front steai, trawlers to Atlantic liners. Most go\\, ernments lay down their battleship, and cruisers singly, and the lesse, eraft perhaps in pairs, but here bai, tleships loom up as twins, light cruh, ^ ers by the half dozen, destroyers i, rows of ten, with many braces of Ion, submarines, and an occasional tnon, tor., The war fleet under the hamme, and the paint brush here would ran, In the naval list above the estahllsl, ments of several modest maritlm, powers.

And the merchant ship, In the stocks are as many as the Un, ted States mercantile marine has ac, dod to its register in several years., "We have trained crews ready t, step on hoard all these ships as soo, as they are fitted," a naval officer r<, marked., The general stage setting for thi, swift review of the fighting and trac, ing vessels under construction cot, sisted of several miles of waterfron, lines as thickly as could he crowds, with skeletons and hulls. The stock, carried everything of the final type, untit next year, or next week, fo, every naval campaign meana ne*, ■ V ■ - I - \' ", a | ideas, new devices, new lines of con, struction. Two years of active ser, - j vice under war conditions have, i- brought a great advance to the Brit, i | ish navy, already acknowledged to lie, a leader in most naval matters. Every, | ship, and every detail of a ship, is the, i ; Iasi word in its class, according to the, - | war-bought judgment of engineers and, i fighting officers. In one noticeable, r details at least British naval arelii, j tects appear to have been converted, -I to ihe principle of one feature of Am, i j erlcan warships., ; The monitors make an appeal to an, American because there is a suspicion, that other navies were disposed to, r scoff at them for years. Yet here, < they are, with all their superficial, - changes and embellishments a tribute, a to what the brain of .lohn Ericsson, ) conceived in the sixties. The monitors, f have been very useful to the British, 1 navy In this war. They have been, i employed in the shallow waters off, a the coast of Belgium, and even more, s effectively at Gallipoli. The corres, pondents there described them fullv., ,Two or three strata of the outlying, hull may be penetrated by torpedoes., a and the monitor can still keep at work, a with her guns., i- Two battleships, almost prepared for, Ihe water, according to information, s rendered, are expected to demonstrate, • themselves the most efficient ma, - chines of their family ever commls, t sioned, and they look it. The battle, 1 ship standing in the Umbers on land, 3 with all its lines revealed, showing its, adaptability for speed, presents a dif, r ferent picture from the fighting ship, i seen above water and bas a eugges, lion of a rac ing yacht. These had been, constructed in something like half the, time consumed in making a big war, ship in pre-war days. There evert sev, ^ oral so-called destroyers c ertainly us, J long ns many light c ruisers of earlier, j times, ten of them extended side by, : side in one row. and others elsewhere., Just where the super-destroyer, | leaves off and the light cruiser begins, | is not it matter of length today. Be, | yond the destroyers was a line of long, thin skeletons of submarines, whose, size could not he judged at all ac, curately in a passing view, even if it, could he reported. Compared with, the now old fashioned submarines, they are as the Aquitania to the Phila, delphia., Floating alongside a dock was a, brand new submarine, painted and pol, ished like a touring cur fresh from, the shop. Her young commander, stood alongside and proudly pointed, out some of her attractions. From his, transparent enthusiasm she might, have been a pleasure yac ht Instead of, the vehicle for the most dangerous, form of adventure that fighting men, undertake. "Of course we are not, in the same class w ith Horton and Hol, brook," he explained, “hut I hope you, will hear something from X Seven, teen," pointing to the number painted, on the turret. He observed also that, this thing could submerge in twenty, seconds., From this largest ship building sta, tion in the world, with Its miles of, smoking factories, and with Us rever, berating clangor of thoqpands of ham, mers ringing upon steel, the party, travelled over night to the most ex, SEATTLE, Aug. 31. - A. ]•\' Haims, lias been appointed general manage, of the Pacific Alaska Navigation Con, panv, with headquarters in this city, I!. .1.

Newltert, a member of the, California fish and game commission,, ^ regarding the propagation of fish and, ^ their distribution among the streams, and lakes of the state., “Contrary to public opinion," says, Mr Newhert, “when the first white, man came to the state he found fish j, only in the ocean, the hays and the i, streajns up to the first waterfalls, and j, of comparatively few species. Since, thou the federal and state authorities, have introduced many valuable and In, tcrestitig varieties and have planted, and transplanted almost every spe, cies so that today California is one‘of, the greatest fishing regions of the, ! world, the result of Intense propuga, tion and conscientious protection., "The first planting of fish was, made in 1S71.

Austin, in, his playing days, was one of the fast, est hacks over developed on the roast, and the opinion is general that the, roach will insist on speed as the key, note of both his offensive and de, fense., It bus been rumored for some time j, that Maurice Klrksey. the fastert, sprinter in northern California, and, now at Stanford, intended to leave, that place and enroll at Santa Clara,, hut it is said he has denied this.

KMC., OUR ELECTION LAW., Among the several official acts of our territorial legislature, that have not exactly met with the approval of their constitu, cuts, is the present election law. Considering tin* large terri, tory and the comparatively sparse population, many of the pro, visions ot the act are admirably suited to the country, but there, 8re others not only perfectly useless and unnecessary, but, which entail a large amount of labor that is uncalled for., For example, the provision which requires a petition to be, filed with the clerk of the court, signed by 100 to 250 names, de, pending upon the office, before a candidate or candidates, who, have been nominated at a regularly held convention may have, their names placed upon the official ballot, is absurd ami\'should, be abolished. Such a provision is all right when it applies to, candidates who desire to run independently, as it provides a, means of getting their names upon the tickets if they have a, sufficient number of followers. But where a number of people,, through their delegates to a convention have already signified, their choice ot a candidate, further procedure than filing a cer, tificate of nomination with the clerk of the court should not be, required. There have been three candidates named for delegate, to congress at regularly constituted party conventions; vet be, tore any ot their names can be placed upon tin* official ballot, the clerk of the court in each division must have received peti, lions signed bv at least 250 names for each candidate. Thus, /.»() persons must sign these petitions in each division, and foi, the four divisions 3,000 names are require si. It is the height ol, absurdity that such should be* necessary., While the provision which permits a bona fide resident ot, the territory to vote wherever lie may be on election day by ob, serving certain formalities appears theoretically to be good,, but it may not work out as anticipated. It is certainly an inno, vation in election laws, and only a test will prove whether it is, beneficial or not. ( ertainly no such law has ever been passes!, in the states, and the voter there who is called away from home, by business or by other affairs loses his vote., This may he a hardship, but after years of experience noth, ing better has been evolved, and in tla* light of past experience, there is nothing to indicate that this innovation in Alaska will, prove any more successful than it would in the states., EXTRACTING THE FANGS., Tile senate extracted the most dangerous fangs of the Phil, ippine hill before passing it, and certainly saved President Wil, son from being badly bitten by one of his new pets. The meas, are does not promise independence within any stated period; il, holds out a promise of freedom when the Filipinos shall have, shown a capacity for self government. The measure provide., for a considerable broadening of native control — a question, able political device for home appeal, not for the benefit of tin, Filipino. Undoubtedly the Philippine islands have been goinj., backward and not forward these last three years owing to weal, white guardianship and an extension of native control. Slid, is our American wav of doing things, superficially and in haste, that we think savagery and tribal government may be convert, ed into civilization and an intelligent democracy in 20 years, And tin* party that seems enthusiastic in this view is the sunn, that would deprive tin- negro of a right to vote after nearly 2(H, years’ contact with the whites., The Philippine hill as passed bv tin* house bristled witl, dangerous possibilities, the worst of which was the four yeai, provision, which the senate has amputated, and by doing so Inn, checked a plague of troubles for us in the Far East., I -:o;, In the general process of world house cleaning the Turk, too, i* purifying his blood and getting rid of these element*, which have troubled him for many years. It is said that tin, Turks have killed about 750,000 Armenians and have driven, out 250,000. They still have about 750,000 to deal with, but, probably will make short work of them. The Armenian is tin, beam and the mote in the Turkish eye. He is a disturber, as tin, Turk sees him. He stands in about tin* same relation to the, Turk as the American Indian stood to tin* pioneers whose rule, was that “the only good Indian is a dead Indian.”, By a man’s complexion shall yet know him at this time of, year. If it looks like the tritoiuia on Monday lie’s not a good, churchman. If it’s a steadfast brown lie’s either an honest, workingman or he belongs to the predatory rich with nothing, to do hut batter the pills and scatter the bills., ---to:- --, Fourteen years ago Denmark offered to us for $5,000,000, the islands which we now propose to buy for $25,000,000.

The Californians, are determined to get back into the, American game as quickly as possible, and in order to achieve this no ex, pense has been spared in employing, ihe best available instructors., Head Coach Andy Smith, of the Uni, versity of Pennsylvania, will be in, supreme command of the coaching, staff. His assistant will be Eddie, Mahan, the famous Harvard star, and, Robert Vaughan, an all American se, lection who played with Princeton., The average college would consider, any one of these men as sufficient,, but California is under the ircessity, of unlearning Rugby as well as learn, ing the American game, and when, these two things are accomplished,, the coaching staff would be reduced, to normal., Tomorrow is the date set for the, first day of practice, and present in, dications are that more than 250 men, will report. Class games, designed to, develop material, will he a feature of, the season. According to the present, plan, the \'varsity squad will be re, duced to fifty men as soon as practi, cable. The remaining men will then, he made up Into class teams. A sche, dule of games will he made up and, there will be regular competition. Men, who are selected for the Varsity, squad will not he eligible for the class, teams., California will start the season with, only three of its last season veterans, missing. These men are Captain Can, field, Saunders (tackle), and Hazel, tine (end)., With the advent of Mahan, who will, have charge of the back field, it is, expected that California will start in, at once and practice its plays from, kick formation, which tend for an open, game., According to the California state, fish and game commission, the pres, ent hunting laws will permit "Of a, steady increase of deer throughout the, slate, providing these laws pre ol), \' served, and the animals are not, slaughtered out of season. This In, crease will keep pace with the in, | crease in population and the conse, j quent growth in the number of hunt, J ers., j To insure this condition which will, | result in “good deer hunting," the, commission asks the co-operation ol, i the people. Some idea of the range, over which these wild creatures roam, is given In the following facts:, , California has a thousand peaks over, I 10,000 feet high, and 130 over 13,non, feet in height. There will remain 50,, J)00 acres of government land, 20,000,, 000 ucres in the national forest re, serves into which sportsmen and, campers arc welcomed by the govern, | merit employees us long as they oh, j serve the fish and game regulations., ! This immense urea of free hunting,, t fishing and camping grounds is large, ly augmented by the liberality of the, 1 farmers and range owners, who will, j rarely object to the use of their raw, j land if the proprieties are observed,, j The great increase in deer is entire, ly due to the laws that, first, prohibit, the sale of deer hides and meat; sec, ond. the kiilimr of does: third the, right and short season; fourth, the, limit; fifth, the protection of \'‘spike", bucks. The protection of spike bucks, does not only help to increase the, deer, but it compels the hunter to, wait until he is sure that the moving, object is a deer with horns, thereby, saving human life. When the law per, mitted the killing of does, many hunt, ets were killed by careless shooters., Now he must wait until he sees the, horns., The Olympic Club of San Francisco,, in the past has turned out some of the, greatest fistic stars of the country, in, cluding such champions as James J., I Corbett and James Ilritt, and believes, ----, it lms the makings of another star, destined to shine in the roped arena., The new pugilistic hope is Lawrence, Higby. it is only two months ago that, Professor George Green, boxing in, structor at the club, first noted the, manner in which Higby handled him, self, and watched his work. So im, pressed was the professor that he took, the young athlete in town and proceed, ed to show him something of the ari, of the game. Higby has proved an, apt pupils and now Green says that In, the not distant future his charge is, quite likely to be a contender for, heavyweight honors., Higby stands six feet two inches in, his stocking feet, and weighs 200 >, pounds.

This supposi, tion was based on the statements of, those in authority at the time of the, recent visit of the court to McCarthy., After a month and a half there is, still a lack of noise from Valdez, which would make the Sphinx sound, like a brass band., The records of the precinct are, in the most sparsely settled portion, of the district, with the exception\'of, half a dozen prospectors all those in, terested in mining in the district are, near McCarthy.
