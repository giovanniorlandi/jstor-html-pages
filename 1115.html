number of teach\ners conceived the idea of beautifying\nseveral vacant lots in the most thick\nly settled portion of the city The\nmatter was taken up with the boys\nand girls and before the people of the\ncity wefe aware of their intention\nthe weeds trash and other debris had\nbeen completely cle ared away and the\nwork of transforming the erstwhile\neyesores of the city into pretty parks\nwas well under way\nWhere weeds grew before smooth\nlawns and fower beds now flourish\nWhere ugliness eMstexFToTiTc uil Uie\neye is now neatness to attract it\nSo great has been the comment upon\nthe work of these little folks that the\nCourierJournal has long since taken\nup the work and added its heartv\ncommendation with promises of a\nhard fight until the splendid example\nis followed in every portion of the\ncity possible\nNothing impaiis the appearance of\na city more than the general unattract\nive appearance of its vacant lots and\nalleys and nothing those of us who\nhave never experienced the pleasure\nof witnessing such a sight may imag\nine serves to attract the eye quicker\nthanto see the unsightly and neglect\ned waste places transformed into pret\nty parks\nWhile the work is yet in its infancy\nthe wave of favor has grown so strong\nthat if is practically certain that a\nsimilar work to that inaugurated by\nthe little folks will be extended from\ntime to time as conditions permit un\ntil Louisville is known as the one\nreally beautiful city of the country\nCertainly nothing will assist to a\ngreater extent in the winning of such\na delightful reputation as the work\ninaugurated by these little school chil\ndren Beaumont Journal\nThe weather was periously near a\nfreeze this morning\nDucks are said to be plentiful on\nthe lakes and streams now\nDont Forget\nThat while you are buying your\nschool books you are dealing with peo\nple who carry most anything found at\na firstclass drug store\nWe are exerting our best efforts to\noffer to the trade a fair honest legiti\nmate place of business and try to\ncause every one who extends the kind\nness to visit our place to go away sat\nisfied feeling they have value re\nceived for their money\nWe are proud to state our business\nfallows a handomse increase in the\npast two years and can only attribute\nthis to the fact thai we try to please\nevery customer and a satisfied cus\ntomer makes new
