For more than a century, ozone has been known to be an\nexcellent disinfectant that nevertheless had to be used with caution for its oxidizing properties. Only during the last decade it\nhas been learned how to tame its great reactivity by precisely dosing its concentration and permanently incorporating the gas\ninto triglycerides where gaseous ozone chemically reacts with unsaturated substrates leading to therapeutically active ozonated\nderivatives. Today the stability and efficacy of the ozonated oils have been already demonstrated, but owing to a plethora of\ncommercial products, the present paper aims to analyze these derivatives suggesting the strategy to obtain products with the\nbest characteristics.\n1. Introduction\nThe increase of ageing, obesity, and diabetes in conjunction\nwith inappropriate healthcare programs have emphasized\nthe problem of having to treat almost 1.5 billion people\naffected by skin and mucosal infections due to bacteria,\nviruses, protozoa, and dysmetabolism. Pathologies range\nfrom the diabetic foot (ulcer with necrosis), bed sores,\nulcers after a trauma or burns, chronic viral infections\ndue to either herpes virus I and II, or human papylloma\nviruses, vaginal infections now frequent also in young\ngirls due to Candida, Trichomonas, and Chlamidia, rectal\nmucosa infections such as anal ragadis, abscesses with\nfistula to end with mouth aphthous ulcers. These infections\nare rarely deadly but are considerably distressing because\nmany patients often suffer of diabetes or vascular diseases\nwith tissue hypoxia, other patients are immunosuppressed\ndrugaddicts, or with concomitant HIV infection. Official\nmedicine provides a variety of drugs that are expensive\nand often poorly efficacious because infections in hypoxic\ntissue contain methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and\nPseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients are suffering not only\nbecause they become uncompliant to frequent medications\nbut they are discouraged by observing a lack of healing\n[1]. Wound healing is a multiphase process involving blood\nclotting, inflammation, tissue proliferation, and remodelling\n[2], but both innate and adoptive immune systems are too\noften hindered by the chronic infection naturally difficult to\novercome. This is also the reason explaining the failure of\ngrowth factors in heavily contaminated ulcers [3, 4].\nThe judicious use of ozone (O3) appears providential\nbecause first of all eliminates the pathogens and then,\nby releasing oxygen (O2), activates the proliferation of\nfibroblasts, hence the building of intercellular matrix with\nconsequent proliferation of keratinoblasts and successive\nhealing.\nIn Section 2, we propose to briefly review the physical\nchemistry of oil ozonation and all the basic analyses necessary\nfor demonstrating the quality of the obtained products.\nIn Section 3, it appears useful to inform readers that both\nskin and mucosae are sensitive to excessive amounts of\ngaseous O3 as there are clear demonstrations of a variety\nof alterations linked to a prolonged exposure. In Section 4,\nwe will then clarify the various procedures devised to\nenhance the disinfectant and healing-promoting properties\nof O3. Finally, after an extensive analysis of a cornucopia of\n', '2 Mediators of Inflammation\nproposals, we will try to suggest guidelines for the future\nmedical application of topical ozone and its derivatives\n(Section 5).\n2. Physical Chemistry of Oil Ozonation with\na Description of the Analytical Methods for\nCharacterizing the Process\nUnsaturated lipid substrates react with insufflated gaseous\nO2/O3 mixture leading to therapeutically active ozonated\nderivatives (Figure 1).\nBriefly, the postulated mechanism known as Criegee\nreaction provides that ozone combines with an unsaturated\nbond to form an initial, unstable primary ozonide which\nreadily decomposes to form a zwitterions and a carbonyl\nfragment. In anhydrous environment these substrates combine\nto give the typical cyclic trioxolane derivative.\nHowever, the word “ozonated” is itself without scientific\nmeaning if it is not associated with “how much” peroxides\nare present in the oil. In fact, from a therapeutic point of\nview, the ozonide compositions have the capacity to deliver\nactive O2 and/or other useful species deep within the lesion\nwithout causing primary skin irritation. The few studies\nconcerned with the therapeutic effects of ozonated oils on\nacute cutaneous wound healing in animal models do not\ninvestigate the dose/behaviour response, expressed as the\namount of peroxides existing in the ozonated derivative used\n[5]. Recently, a quantitative evaluation of the therapeutic\neffect of topically applied ozonated sesame oil on acute\ncutaneous wound healing in mice as animal model has been\ndeveloped [6]. The results indicate that both low (<1000)\nand high doses (>3000), as expressed in terms of peroxide\nvalue (see the corresponding section in this paper), delay\ncutaneous wound healing. Such an evidence is reinforced\nby a number of results between groups where the “middle”\nconcentration (about 1500) has the most beneficial effect in\naccelerating the wound closure ratio.\nFrom an industrial applicative viewpoint, the overall\nquality of ozonated derivatives depends upon several parameters,\nsuch as: (i) the type and the quality of ozone generators;\n(ii) the ozonation conditions, in terms of reactors and\ntime, material type and amount, presence of water and/or\ncatalyzers; (iii) the efficacy of the ozonizer, in terms of\nO3 concentration output, gas flow, gas carrier. As for the\nlatter, the use of medical grade O2 instead of air is an\nimportant point to be considered; in fact, air feedstock\n(containing about 78% of nitrogen) used for the ozonation\nof unsaturated substrates could lead to the production\nof potentially toxic nitrated by-products [7], and to a\nsignificant decrease of the ozonation efficiency [8]. Another\nimportant feature is that ozonated oil has to be unequivocally\ncharacterized in terms of the species contents as well as the\nreaction kinetics. For these purposes, the knowledge of the\nphysicochemical properties of ozonated vegetable oils during\nproduction has a great importance for their characterization\nand identification. For determining the quality of ozonated\nproducts, spectroscopic techniques, as Fourier-Transformed\nInfrared (FT-IR) and 1H and 13C-NMR [9], together with\nanalytical methods as peroxide, acidity, and iodine values\nas well as viscometric determination are usually carried out\n[10].\n2.1. FT-IR Spectroscopy. FT-IR spectroscopy is used to\nhighlight differences in the functional groups during the\noil ozonation, in particular the decrease of the bands\ncorresponding to both C=C and =C–H stretching (e.g.,\nsesame oil at 1654 cm−1 and 3009 cm−1, respe), and the\nincrease of the band corresponding to ozonide CO stretching\n(e.g., sesame oil at 1105 cm−1).\nOzonated samples can be analyzed using two different\nmethods.\n(1) An adequate aliquot (usually about 2 μL) of sample\nis deposited between two disks of KBr, avoiding air\nbubble formation, then the percentage transmittance\nor other suitable parameters are measured in the\nrange 4000–800cm−1. Spectra are obtained setting\nthe appropriate scan summations and minimal resolution\n(generally, 16 at 4 cm−1, resp.).\n(2) An adequate aliquot (usually about 2 μL) of sample\nis dissolved in a suitable solvent (preferably chloroform)\nand then the solution is settled in the sample\nholder avoiding air bubble formation, then the transmittance\n(expressed as a percentage) or other suitable\nparameters are measured in the range 4000–800\ncm−1. Spectra are obtained setting the appropriate\nscan summations and minimal resolution (generally,\n16 at 4 cm−1, resp.).\n2.2. NMR Spectroscopy. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies are\nperformed to obtain more information about the variation of\nthe functional groups involved in the reaction of ozonation.\nBoth the disappearance of the signals relative to protons and\ncarbons on the double bond (e.g., in sesame oil 5.29 ppm,\nand various signals in the range 127.8–130.0 ppm, resp.)\nand the parallel appearance of a signal on the proton\nand carbon of 1,2,4-trioxolane (e.g., in sesame oil in the\n5.11–5.08 ppm range, and 103.4–104.3 ppm range, resp.) are\nevidenced. Quantitative analysis can be performed by spectra\nnormalized with respect to the integral areas of the OCH2\nprotons (glycerol) that remain constant during the whole\nprocess.\nSpectra will be obtained using suitable instruments by\nsolubilizing the ozonated sample in a proper solvent (preferably\nCDCl3). Particularly, an adequate aliquot (usually about\n100 μL) of sample is solubilised with 750 μL of CDCl3 in\na 5 mm NMR tube, then the analysis will be performed.\nTo obtain quantitative data, it is sufficient to perform a\n1H-NMR, while 13C-NMR essentially provides qualitative\ninformations [9].\n2.3. Iodine Value. The iodine value (IV) represents the\nquantity of iodine (in grams) that will react with the double\nbonds in 100 grams of sample. IV is determined according\n', 'Mediators of Inflammation 3\nPalmitate\nLinoleate\nOleate Primary ozonides\nSecondary ozonides\nCriegee ozonides\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO3\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO O\nO\nO\nO\nO O\nO\nO\nOO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nOO\nO\nO\nO\nOO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nOO\nO\nOO\nFigure 1: Representative chemical structures of ozonated derivatives which are formed by chemical reaction of ozone with unsaturated\ntriglycerides. The primary ozonides are transient, unstable species which rearrange in the normal, secondary ozonides also known as Criegee\nozonides.\nto the Pharmacopoeia monographs. The IV is calculated by\nmeans of the following equation:\nIV = 1.269 · (n1 − n2)\nm\n, (1)\nwhere n1 is the volume in mL of thiosulphate solution\n(0.1 M) used for carry out a blank test, n2 is the volume in\nmL of thiosulphate solution (0.1 M) used for the titration\nand m the quantity, in grams, of substance. It is, therefore,\na measure of the total number of double bonds present in\nthe sample and for such a reason it is a chemical analysis\nuseful for evaluating the decrease of double bonds during the\noil ozonation process, giving information about the 1,2,4trioxolane\nformation.\n2.4. Acid Value. The acid value (AV) is an index that\nexpresses, in mg, the quantity of potassium hydroxide\nrequired to neutralise the free acids presents in 1 g of the\nsubstance. The AV is calculated by means of the following\nequation:\nAV = 5.610 · n\nm\n, (2)\nwhere n is the volume in mL of titrant and m the quantity, in\ngrams, of substance.\nIt is representative of the acidity level of the product and\nit represents an index of the degradation by-products that\ncould be formed during the ozonation process.\n2.5. Peroxide Value. Peroxide value, (PV), is usually used as\nan indicator of the advancement and/or the control of the\nozonation process because of its simplicity, rapidity, and low\ncost. Moreover, the PV may be adequate for the stability\nevaluation of vegetable oil ozonides and it appears to be\nvery important for commercial distribution as well as for\nthe determination of the better storage modalities. However,\nit had been necessary to standardize the methodology for a\nvalidated PV.\nIn the present paper, a detailed analysis of PV assessments\nof ozonated lipid derivatives based on both literature data\nand our laboratory experiments will be presented together\nwith their possible correlations with other techniques. Such\na report allows an in-depth acquaintance of the ozonation\nprocess of vegetable oils as well as of the related products\nobtained, allowing to define the quality parameters useful\nfor industrial purposes. Specifically, the peroxide value (PV)\nrepresents the quantity of peroxide expressing in milliequivalents\nof active O2 contained in 1000 g of the sample.\nFor the PV evaluation, three different methods were\nadopted.\n(a) First official monograph described in Pharmacopoeia\n(e.g., European Pharmacopoeia, British Pharmacopoeia,\nUnited States Pharmacopoeia), which pro-\nvides the solubilization of sample in 30 mL of\nchloroform/glacial acetic acid (2 : 3), the addition of\nsaturated potassium iodide solution (0.5 mL) and\nthe titration after 1 minute with a solution of sodium\nthiosulphate.\n', '4 Mediators of Inflammation\n(b) Second method described by Martinez Tellez et al.\n[11], which always provides the solubilization of\nsample in 30 mL of chloroform/glacial acetic acid\n(2 : 3) and the addition of saturated potassium iodide\nsolution (0.5 mL), but the titration is done after\n24 hours.\n(c) Third method recently proposed [10]. Briefly, 2 g of\nSO were weighed in a 250 mL conical flask and 30 mL\nof chloroform/glacial acetic acid (2 : 3) were added.\nThen, 3.0 mL of saturated potassium iodide solution\nwere added. The flask was stirred at reflux temperature\n(60◦C) for various times (5–180 minutes). After\nthis time, the solution was cooled and 25 mL of water\nwere added. Solutions of sodium thiosulphate at the\nappropriate concentration (0.0001–0.1 M) were used\nfor the titration.\nIn all determinations the PV was calculated by means of\nthe following equation:\nPV = 1000 · (V1 −V0) · c\nm\n, (3)\nwhere V1 is the volume in mL of thiosulphate solution used\nfor the titration, V0 is the volume in mL of thiosulphate\nsolution used for carry out a blank, c the thiosulphate\nconcentration and m the sample quantity (grams).\nThe ozonation efficiency (expressed as a percentage)\nrepresents ratio of the amount of peroxidation due to\nozonation process, as estimated by PV value, to the O3 total\namount applied to the system. It was calculated by means of\nthe following equation:\nOE = (PVs − PV0)\n1000\n× 24\nOAD\n× 100, (4)\nwhere PVs is the ozonated sample PV, PV0 is the PV of\nuntreated sample, and OAD stands for the O3 applied dose\n(mg/g).\n2.6. Viscosity Measurement. Viscosity evaluation is a useful\ntechnique because it is fast and it could be online, giving\nan estimation of the double bonds present in the sample. In\nfact, the greater the ozonation time the higher the product\nviscosity because of the disappearance of the double bonds.\nMoreover, its typical trend can be a useful tool in providing a\nrapid quality control assessment during the entire ozonation\nprocess, as well as to decide on the process time for obtaining\nthe desired ozonation level of the sample [9].\n3. Cutaneous Responses to Environmental\nOzone Exposure\nThe skin, along with the respiratory tract, is directly exposed\nto environmental pollutants including O3, an important\nconstituent of photochemical smog. Although numerous\nstudies have documented effects of O3 on the respiratory\ntract in animals and humans [12–15], only recently some\nstudies characterizing its effect on cutaneous tissue have\nbeen published [16–20]. The skin consists of two main\nlayers, the inner dermis, mainly composed of fibroblasts and\nconnective tissue matrix, and the outer epidermis, which\ncontains keratinocytes that, by progressively differentiating\nto form enucleate corneocytes, become imbedded in a lipid\nmatrix and together comprise the outermost part of the\nepidermis, the stratum corneum (SC) [21, 22].\nPrevious studies have shown that exposure to O3 results\nin the depletion of both water soluble and lipophilic\nantioxidants such as uric acid, ascorbic acid, and tocopherol,\nand this was accompanied by increase in parameters of both\nlipid peroxidation and protein modification, primarily in the\noutermost skin layers [16, 17, 23].\nIn further studies, we were also able to show that the\nexposure of hairless mice to O3 will not only deplete the\nantioxidant levels and increase oxidative markers but these\nmolecules are able to induce active cell responses.\nThese effects can be briefly summarized as follows.\n(1) Induction of Redox Sensitive Transcription Factors. Ozone,\nlike many others environmental challenges, is able to activate\ntranscriptional factors redox sensitive such as Nuclear Factor\nk B (NFkB). This transcriptional factor acts as an activator\nfor a multitude of proinflammatory genes (IL-8, TNFα,\nTGFβ) and adhesion molecules (ICAM and VCAM). It\nhas been assessed that O3 is able to activate NFkB using\nboth in vitro and in vivo systems. Thiele et al. [16], using\nan immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells), were\nable to show that O3 induced the activation of NFkB by\nelectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Ozone induced\na dose dependent activation of the transcription factor. This\neffect was likely to be mediated by ROS, particularly H2O2,\nbecause it was inhibited by the incubation of the cells with\nlipid soluble antioxidants (tocopherol).\n(2) Induction of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) and Inflammatory\nMarkers. As a consequence of the induction of transcription\nfactors, O3 exposure (6 days to 0.8 μg/mL for 6 hours/day)\ninduced the expression of proinflammatory markers in\nskin homogenates such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This\ninduction was accompanied by an increase level of heat\nshock protein (HSP) 32, also known as heme oxygenase-1\n(HO-1). In this paper, we were the first to demonstrate the\nupregulation of HSPs 27, 32 and 70 in homogenized murine\nskin upon O3 exposure. HSP27 showed the earliest (2 hours)\nand highest (20-fold) response to O3 compared with the\ndelayed induction (12 hours) of HSP70 and HO-1. HSP27\nis expressed predominantly in the suprabasal epidermis in\nhuman skin, whereas HSP70 predominates in the dermis\ncompared with the epidermis. These differences in location\nbetween HSP27 and HSP70 might explain the different\ntime course of induction of these stress proteins upon O3\nexposure. It is therefore possible that the generated bioactive\ncompounds may be responsible for the induction of HSPs as\nwas also shown after UV irradiation.\n(3) Induction of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs). Among\nthe multiple systems altered in the skin by environmental\npollutants, MMPs are among the major targets. Indeed, O3\n', 'Mediators of Inflammation 5\nexposure is able to affect their synthesis and/or activity with\nlogical consequences on tissue remodeling and wound healing\n[23, 24]. Within the MMP family, MMP-2 and MMP-9\nare the only members able to degrade type-IV collagen of the\nbasal membranes [25]. MMP-2 is involved in pathological\nprocesses such as photoageing and precancerous/cancerous\nskin lesions after UV exposure; moreover, MMP-2 is capable\nof cleaving other substrates, in addition to type-IV collagen,\nincluding other MMPs and therefore can (indirectly) control\nextracellular matrix degradation and remodelling.\nMMP-9, like MMP-2, plays a role in human skin ageing\n[26] tumor development [27], as well as in other cutaneous\nlesions such as psoriasis and dermatitis [28, 29]. In a recent\nstudy, we were able to demonstrate that O3, was able to\naffect MMP activity. Most likely the generation of bioactive\nmolecules can be the cause of such activation. It has been\nalso demonstrated that O3 is able to induce NO production\nvia the activation of iNOS in cutaneous tissues [18]. When\nproduced in excess, NO, may combine with superoxide\nto form peroxinitrite (derived from other sources) that\ncan activated MMPs especially MMP-9. Thus, the increase\nof oxidative stress after O3 exposure, plus the interaction\nbetween O2 and nitrogen active molecules might be the main\nmechanism that leads to the enhanced MMPs activities in\nskin tissues. This can be also a result from an imbalance\nbetween MMPs and their endogenous inhibitors, the tissue\ninhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [30].\nIn fact, the activities of MMPs are regulated by TIMPs,\nwhich can be produced by a multitude of cell types present\nin the cutaneous tissue. While MMP activity is altered by the\nO3, neither TIMP-1 nor TIMP-2 level expression is affected.\nThe lack of changes in TIMP-1 and 2 levels, combined with\nthe increased activity of MMPs suggest that O3 can cause a\nnet increase in matrix degradation. On the other hand, in a\ncomparative study where normal skin has been exposed for\ntwo hours to environmentally realistic levels of ozone, only\na moderate state of oxidative stress at level of the stratum\ncorneum has been induced, without producing a visible\nclinical response [31].\n4. Skin Age-Related Responses to\nOzone Exposure: Wound Healing\nWound healing is a critical process in the skin and it has\nknown to be affected by oxidative stress and also to decline\nwith increasing age [32]. Although the exact sequence of\nwound healing is complex, cutaneous wound healing begins\nwith wounding induced signaling factor-based transformation\nof stationary keratinocytes into cells capable of both\nreplication and migration. Upon transformation, these cells\nexpress a host of molecules that promote the invasion of the\ninjured epithelial matrix and reepithelialisation of the wound\nsurface [33]. Delayed wound healing in the elderly has been\nwell described [34].\nAs mentioned above, O3 exposure is also associated with\nactivation of transcription factor NFkB, which is important\nto regulate inflammatory responses and eventually entire\nwound healing. O3 exposure increased levels of Transforming\nGrowth Factor (TGF-β) that is a critical factor in tissue\nremodeling [35, 36]. We can summarize that while O3 as\nan oxidant, might stimulate wound healing, it would be\ndetrimental in an “aging environment” due to the increased\nconcentration-dependent oxidative stress. Therefore, these\naspects have biological as well as practical implications and\nneeded further investigations.\nIn a recent study, we demonstrated the detrimental\neffects of O3 on cutaneous wound healing in the aged\nanimals. In fact, when hairless young (8-week-old) and aged\nmice (18-months-old) with after full thickness excisional\nwounds were exposed to 0.5μg/mL O3 for 6 hours per\nday the rate of wound closure was significantly delayed in\nthe old group. We also showed induction of protein and\nlipid oxidation assessed as changes in protein oxidation\n(carbonyls) and lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxynonenal, HNE\nadducts) in the old mice compared to the young mice during\nthe later stage of cutaneous wound healing. O3 exposure\nhas different effects depending on the age of the mice. In\nfact, it significantly delayed wound closure in old mice,\nwhile in young mice, it led to accelerated trend during the\nfirst few days of the exposure. This might be attributed\nto the antibacterial properties of O3, as it has been shown\nthat application of “hydropressive” ozonation provides fast\ncleansing of wound surface from pyonecrotic masses, promotes\nelimination of infection and thus substantially reduces\nthe period of treatment of the patients [37]. Recently, clinical\ntreatments using hyperbaric oxygen therapy demonstrated\nthat increased O2 tension at the wound site increases the\nformation of granulation tissue, enhances accelerated wound\nclosure and ameliorates impaired dermal wound healing\n[38]; therefore, accelerated trend of wound closure shown\nin young population may be due to decreased bacterial\ninfection and/or increased O2 tension by O3 exposure in\nwound area.\nOne of the possible driving processes of the effect of O3\non wound healing can be also in this case the modulation\nof the transcription factor NFkB. Interestingly, the dose–\neffect relationship between level of oxidative stress and NFkB\nexhibits a biphasic profile: while moderate levels of oxidative\nstress activate NFkB through an IkB kinase independent\nmechanism, extremely high levels of oxidative stress have\nbeen shown to inhibit NFkB activation by blocking IkBα\nphosphorylation [39]. One potential explanation for the\ndifferential effect in the older animals is that the level of\noxidative stress generated by O3 exposure combined with\naging causes levels of oxidative stress that inhibits IkBα\nphosphorylation, thereby resulting in a decline in NFkB\nactivation. This finding is consistent with what mentioned\npreviously that O3 exposure induced skin antioxidants\ndepletion.\nThis interpretation is also bolstered by data on TGF-β\na crucial modulator of tissue remodeling and is linked to\nboth NFkB status as well as to levels of oxidative stress\nduring entire wound healing process [40]. The reduced TGFβ\nlevels in both air and O3 exposed old mice as well as the\nlower induction of TGFβ by O3 exposure in the old animals\nsuggests that the noted delays in wound closure might be\nrelated to defects in oxidative stress-dependent NFkB status\n', '6 Mediators of Inflammation\nas well as levels of oxidative stress and TGFβ signaling in aged\nmice during later stage of wound healing.\n5. Topical Application of Ozone in Medicine\nTo the best of our knowledge, the first application of gaseous\nO3 was performed during World War I for treating German\nsoldiers affected by gaseous gangrene due to Clostridium\nanaerobic infections very sensitive to O3 [41, 42]. In 1936,\nDr P. Aubourg, by using a metal cannula, was the first to\npropose the insufflations of gaseous O2/O3 in the rectum to\ntreat chronic colitis, anal ragadis and fistulae. This approach\nis very empirical and unprecise and today it is mostly used by\nCuban physicians. In 1937, a Swiss dentist, E. A. Fisch (1899–\n1966) had the idea to use it in his practice and, by a twist\nof fate, he treated Dr. E. Payr (1871–1946) a surgeon who\nhad a painful gangrenous pulpit. Payr was so enthusiastic\nof the O3 effect to use it in his surgical practice with great\nadvantage [43]. Later on, Werkmeister [44] mastered the use\nof gaseous O3 in several skin ulcers due to atherosclerosis,\ndiabetes and radiotherapy by either enclosing a leg in a\npolythene-bag (the so-called bagging system) or using an\nozone-resistant plastic cup applied in other areas. In the\nformer application the gas was introduced to just inflate\nthe bag containing some distilled water. The system was\nstatic but after 20–25 minutes the gas was aspirated and\ndestroyed. The O3 concentrations varied between a high\n80μg/mL in very purulent ulcers and progressively lower\nconcentrations down to 10μg/mL as the ulcers improved\nbecause excessive O3 would be deleterious for healing. As the\ncup system had an inlet and an outlet, Werkmeister could\nrealize a continuous gas flow with a modest depression that\nenhanced the vasodilation of the ulcer’s area. With both\nsystems he treated many extensive and otherwise incurable\nlesions within 50–200 days. It is noteworthy that gaseous O3\nworks well only in a water vapour-saturated bag because it\nmust dissolve into superficial water or in the exudate to react\nproficiently. The normal skin does not undergo any damage\nduring the treatment. Today these procedures are still in use\nbut they are somewhat cumbersome and great care must be\nexercised to prevent air contamination.\nHow ozonated oils act remains an open question.\nProbably, when the stable triozonide comes into contact with\nthe warm exudate of the wound, it slowly decomposes into\ndifferent peroxides, which readily dissolves in water, probably\ngenerating hydrogen peroxide that can explain the prolonged\ndisinfectant and stimulatory activity. If it is correct, this\nreasoning implies that we should have titrated preparations\nwith high, medium, or low ozonide concentrations to be used\nduring the inflammatory septic phase I, regenerating phase\nII or remodelling phase III, respectively [2]. These phases\nhave been related to the rapidly changing cell types and to\nthe release of cytokines and growth factors that modulate the\ncomplex healing process.\nAn alternative method for treating diabetic foot ulcers is\nthe use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HOT) but in such a\ncase one disadvantage is the use of only hyperbaric O2 and\nanother is the need to close the patient in the chamber for\ntwo hours. Therapeutic results are far more modest than\ntopical O3 application, particularly when it is contained in\na close cabinet with thermostatically-controlled temperature.\nHowever this procedure requires considerable idle times and,\nif an aspirating pump is unavailable, it may contaminate the\noperating room. For these reason today for cleaning and\ndisinfecting cutaneous and mucosal infections and lesions\ndue to many causes (like, e.g., trauma, ischemia, burns), it\nappears preferable to use at once freshly ozonated water and\nthen ozonated oil, particularly during the night or at rest\nconditions.\nThe process of water ozonation needs of double distilled\nwater and O3 concentrations ranging from 20 up to\n100μg/mL of gas to have a final yield of 5 up to 25μg/mL,\nrespectively. O3 is directly bubbled into the water and the\ngas in excess is passed through a dehydrating device and\nfinally through a destructor. Depending upon the water\nvolume and the gas flow, a period of ozonation between 5–\n20 minutes is sufficient to saturate the water with gaseous\nO3. In fact, if the water is ultrapure, O3 physically dissolves\nin the absence of chemical reactions and if kept in a glass\nbottle closed with a Teflon cap, the concentration halves only\nafter 300 hours at 0◦C. However, at 20◦C the half-life is\nabout 10 hours [45]. It must be noted that monodistilled\nwater allows a much faster O3 decomposition and it is not\npractical. It is adviced to maintain the bottle at 4◦C and\nto quickly close the bottle at any time, or better to have\na valve system to prevent gas losses. It would be useful to\ndevice a procedure for maintaining the O3 concentration for\nlonger times and we are investigating a possible procedure.\nOn the other hand, ozonation of either olive or sunflower\noils requires a much longer time and the procedure needs to\nbe well-standardized in terms of gas-flow, O3 concentration,\noil volume, and temperature. As recently reviewed, at least\ntwenty different vegetable oils have been patented but so\nfar it remains impossible to define their relative cost/benefit\n[46]. At this stage, after evaluating several physicochemical\ncriteria, stability, efficacy, and cost, it seems that sesame oil\nhas several advantages in comparison to other oils.\nHow and when ozonated water and oils are used?\nChronic wounds range from diabetic foot to putrid and deep\nulcers due to limb atherosclerosis, or trauma and burns.\nMoreover, both immunosuppressive chemotherapy and/or\nmalnutrition cause abscesses, anal fissures and fistulae, bed\nsores, furunculosis, and osteomyelitis which are difficult to\ntreat and often fail after prolonged treatments. About 7\nmillion patients in the United States are affected with a cost\nover US$ 25 billion annually. Various types of disinfectants,\nantibiotics, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and growth factors\nare scarcely effective because the deranged metabolism and\nlocal hypoxia are not modified. Several other approaches\nsuch as vacuum therapy [47, 48], maggot therapy [49]\nand devices for providing topical oxygen therapy in a\nclinical setting have been proposed and variably used. This\nlast approach has a rationale in the sense that enhanced\noxygenation is useful for activating the metabolism and cell\nproliferation of ischemic tissues [50–52]. However, it has also\nconsiderable limitations because it is a cumbersome therapy,\nwith minimal disinfectant activity and modifications of the\nfundamental pathogenetic mechanisms.\n', 'Mediators of Inflammation 7\nAnother topic of critical interest is the pathologies of the\nvaginal mucosa. Although rarely deadly (as the toxic shock\nsyndrome due to a forgotten absorbent tampon), a majority\nof women physically and psychologically frequently suffer\nfrom a number of infections due to several pathogens such\nas Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida\nalbicans, Chlamidia trachomatis, Herpes virus type-II (HVII),\nhuman papilloma viruses (HPV), human immunod-\neficiency virus (HIV), often due to unprotected sexual\nintercourses, stress, change in sexual partners and also\nphysiological hormonal changes during menopausa. About\n20 million Americans are affected by the distressing HV-II\nand as many 40 million have the genital HPV with warts\nand the impending risk of cervix cancer. Moreover, the\nfurther implantation of opportunistic infections complicates\nthe treatment. It is unfortunate that orthodox medications\nare expensive and not so useful because of drug-resistant\npathogens and side effects limiting the compliance. So far\nofficial medicine has not yet entertained the topical use\nof O3 and derivatives in therapy because they are not\nprofitable and no extensive clinical trials have been published\nin peer-reviewed journals: the therapy has remained\nin practitioners’ hands and the results remain anecdotal.\nMoreover, the parenteral use of ozone, also known as\nozone therapy, is very useful as adjuvant: it is reasonably\nease to perform in terms of classical ozonated major and\nminor autohemotherapy [53]. The latter modality has been\nsuccessfully used for eliminating recurrences of HV-I and\nII infections. However, topical therapy is essential and it\nis carried out by using vaginal irrigation of fresh ozonated\nwater and application of vaginal ozonated oil pessaries\nfor the night. During prolonged treatment the ozonated\ncompounds allows the elimination of any pathogens. So\nfar no resistance to O3 has been demonstrated. Creams\ncontaining ozonated oils can be used 3-4 times daily\nfor external genital areas and also for several anorectal\naffections.\nAs for the oral infections (aphthae, HV-I, opportunistic\nsuperinfections, or acne) the earliest as possible application\nof ozonated ointments, by minimizing pathogen diffusion\nand enhancing microcirculation, reduces the swelling,\ndestroys the pathogen, and allows a rapid healing.\nLast but not least, clinical trials in tinea pedis as well as\nonychomycosis [54, 55] have been recently published and\nhave shown the usefulness of ozonated sunflower oil.\n6. Conclusions\nAt the present, especially in young people, venereal infections\nare increasingly frequent and therefore a suitable,\neffective medication with ozonated compounds will be a\nhuge economical and social value. Also, elderly people are\nburdened with a variety of wounds and ulcers, some of\nwhich never heal, making life miserable. It is hoped that\nthe present paper will inform official medicine for this\nadvance and will incite to programme suitable clinical trials\nto show the full efficacy of ozone therapy by evidence-based\nmedicine.\nReferences\n[1] F.
