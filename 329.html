WOODROW WILSON,\nwho will leave for Europe early next month where the president\nwill attend the world’s greatest peacp conference.\nI\nPresident Woodrow Wilson’s\nThanksgiving Proclamation\n'TfT HAS long been our custom to turn in the autumn of\nthe year in praise and thanksgiving to Almighty God\nfor His many blessings and mercies to us as a nation.\nThis year we have special and moving cause to be grate\nful and to rejoice. God in His good pleasure has given us\npeace. It has not homcrri'a *n.',cT? -cessnl iorr or amis,* a\nmere relief from the strait: and tragedy of war. It\nhas come as a great triumph of right. Complete victory\nhas not brought us peace alone, but the confident promise\nof anew day as well, in which justice shall replace force\nand jealous intrigue among the nations. Our gallant\narmies have participated in a triumph which is not marred\nor stained by any purpose of selfish aggression. In a\nrighteous cause they have won im in or tin glory and have\nnobly served their nation in serving mankind. God has\nindeed been gracious We have cause for such rejoicing\nas revives and strengthens in us all the best traditions of\nour national history. A new day shines about us, in\nwhich our hearts take new courage and look forward with\nnew hope to new and greater duties.\nWhile we render thanks for these things, let us not\nforget to seek the divine guidance in the performance of\nthose duties, and divine mercy and forgiveness for all\nerrors of act or purpose and pray that in all that we do\nwe shall strengthen the ties of friendship and mutual\nrespect upon which we must assist to build the new\nstiucture of peace and good will among the nations.\nWherefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, president of the\nUnited States of America, do hereby designate Thursday,\nthe 28th day of November next, as a day of thanksgiving\nand prayer, and invite the people throughout the land to\nsease upon that day from their occupations and in\ntheir several homes and places of worship to render\nthanks to God, the ruler of nations\nTn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be affixed.\nDone in the District of Columbia, this 17th day of\nNovember, in the year of our Lord, one thousand nine\nhundred and eighteen and of the independence of the\nUnited States of America, the one hundred and forty\nthird. By the President. Woodrow Wilson.\nRobert Lansing, Secretary of State.\nN\n______—'\nCongress Adjourns.\n-*.\nAfter being in continuous ses\nsion for nearly a year, the\nNational Congress adjourned\nThursday, which will give the\nmembers of the two bodies a\nmuch needed rest and a chance\nto go home and shake hands with\ntheir constituents.\nBritish Lose 600,000.\nThe British War Department\nhas given out the information\nthat the total number of British\nkilled during the present war is\n658,829, and that the number\nkilled, wounded and missing\namounts to 2,900,000.\n■0.\n' r v‘ ' ^\nStrike At Pascagoula.\nA stride affecting several hun\ndred men at the shipbuilding\nplants, prants at Pascagoula was\nordered and put into effect last\nSaturday, the men giving as\nthe cause, the failure of the com\npanies to fulfill their promises\nof an increase wage scale. (\nA good number of men from\nStone County, who were em\nployed at the plants, joined the\nothers and are here awaiting\nfurther developments. In all\nprobability conditions will be\nsatisfactorily arranged and the\nmen put back to work in a few\ndays.\nA.. ?r •' . ; #\nA . ...\nRed Cross Help Many\nInfluenza Victims\nThe Red Cross workers with\ntheir local funds supplemented\n$200 b.v the town of Wiggins and\n$200 by the county, are doing a\ngreat work in the influenza epi\ndemic that is now upon us.\nA canteen was opened Monday\nnext door to the postoffice where\nfood is repared and sent out to\nthe sick. It should be under\nstood that these funds are avail\nable for all sections of the county\nand anyone knowing of a needy\nfamily or community where the\n“flu” is epidemic like should not\nhesitate to call on the Stone\nCounty Red Cross Chapter for\nrelief.\nSoldiers In England\nWill Return First\nThe first of the American sol\ndiers now on foreign soil to\nreturn home will be about twenty\nthousand men now stationed in\nEngland. The first ship load of\nsoldiers will leave for the States\nwithin the next few days.\ni tie soldiers in France, it is\nreported, will remain there for\nseveral weeks before any steps\nwill be taken to bring them\nhome.\nMaking Syrup At ‘King B.”\nManager J. B, Dorsett, of the\n| King B. Ranch, has had a crew\nbusily engaged for the past ten\ndays making syrup on . his- big i\nf farm east of Wiggins.;\nMr. Dorsett placed an order\nthis week for four thousand\nsyrup can lables to be used on\nthe cans of syrup put up by him.\nThe grade of syrup being put\nup is very line, according to\nthose who have had an oppor\ntunity to see and taste the\nproduct.\nGermans Loss Heavy.\nGermany reports that one.\nmillion, five hundred and eighty -\nthousand of her soldiers were\nkilled during the war just closed.\nFour million of her soldiers were\nwounded and five hundred thous\nand prisoners are now in the\nhands of the allies.\n‘FLU’ CONDITION\nIS SOME BETTER\nSituation Said To Be Im\nproving All Over the\nCounty\nBecause of Wiggins and the\nsurrounding country being in\nthe grip of an influenzaepidemic\nfor the past ten days, businos\nhas reached a low ebb, schools\nhave been closed down indefi\nnitely, church services have been\nsuspended and business in gen\neral has been at a standstill.\nThe town of Wiggins lias had\nnearly two hundred cases with\nno deaths, except three negroes\nin the Pinkbine quarters, east of\ntowrn. About one hundred cases\nhave been reported, at Bond and\nin the ruaal districts east and\nwest of Wiggiijs.\nAt Stillmore several cases\nhave been reported, but no\ndeaths. It is estimated by those\nin touch with the situation in\nStone County, that there has'\nbeen four hundred cases during\nthe past two weeks.\nThe local Red Cross Chapter\ni_i _ n n. __ ... l _ . .\nuan uccil tilt: vvttn o>\ncuring nurses and furnishing\nnourishment to the patients in\nthis section of the county. The\npeople responded nobly in help\ning to furnish the proper kind of\nfood, which was prepared at the\nlocal Red Cross canteen, and\nautomobile owners have respond\ned to the call for help in deliver\ning the fond and carrying nurses\nto and from their work and visit\ning the patients throughout the\ndistrict.\nThe local physicians are of the\nopinion that the epidemic will be\nover within another week and\nwith the situation well in hand\nat this time, and with a well\norganized Red Cross force, who\nstand ready at any moment to go\nto any part of the county where\nhelp is needed, it is thought that\nepidemic will soon be checked\nand all schools-' will resume\noperation and that business in\ngeneral will get back to normal\nconditions,\nP. E, Bond, of McHenry, was\nhere Tuesday looking after his\nauto business. _ '\nThey Used Good\nJudgement\nThe parties who broke into our store\nTuesday night undoubtedly knew\nquality, as well as style; they knew\nwhere to go to get the best in dry\ngoods and clothing, however, if they\nhad known what bargains we offer,\nthey would ‘have found it much\ncheaper to have come in and made a\npurchase of what they needed:\n- y-j\nWiggins Dry\nGoods Company\nA.

STONE COUNTY, MISS., NOV. 23, 1918\nWar Will\nSavings Save\nStamps [ I Soldiers\nAN INVITATION\nWe are sending the Enterprise to\na number of people in Stone County\nthis week wh} are not subscribers, but\nwe are anxious for you to become a\nregular reader of your county paper\nand this copy of the Enterprise is sent\nyou with a special invitation to join\nour big family of weekly readers and\nthereby get all the county news each\nweek as well as state and national\nnews. The price of a year’s subscrip\ntion is only one dollar, but the price\nwill probably go to $1.50 after January\n1st, So let us have your subscription\nnow.\nEnterprise Management.\nVOTE JVEX T SAJ UR DA Y\nOn next Satu rday, Nov. 30th, the voters of\nStone County will be given the opportunity to go\nto the polls and cast their vote on live questions,\nwhich the Board of Supervisors thought best to\nsubmit to the voters of the county for their de\ncision.\nIt was not mandatory on the Board of Super\nvisors to submit these five questions to the vote of\nthe people, but inasmuch as all five propositions\nare of special interest to the fieople of the county.\n,. it was the feeling of the members of the Board\nthat it would be best to let the people vote their\nconviction concerning each one of the subjects.\nWe believe a majority of the people of Stone\nCounty would vote for the dog law and the game\nlaw if they were assured both laws would be en\nforced to the letter, but we can only judge the\nfuture by the past, and this being the case, the\npeople will feel that neither of the laws will be en\nforc«d only in part, and would no doubt be to the\ndetriment of some, while to the advantage of\nothers.\nThe question of employing a County Farm\nDemonstrator is one, in our opinion that should be\ndecided by the farmers of the county. We do not\nmean that farmers only should vote on this ques\ntion, but that those who are not farmers should\ntry and inform themselves as to the wishes of the\nfarmers of the county and vote accordingly.\n. The question of continuing the Home Eco\nnomic Agent is also one that the wishes of the\nfarmers, their wives and the girls canning club\nof the county should be consulted about before\ncasting our vote. This department works directly\nwith the home life and at this time is doing a great\nwork among the canning club girls of the eounty.\nThe proposition of publishing the proceedings\noi the Board of Supervisors each month is one,\nperhaps, that every tax payer in the county is in\nterested in. The Board of Supervisors of this\ncounty, as servants of the people and directors of\nthe affairs of the county, have the spending of\nmore than sixty thousand dollars each year, and if\nthe full proceedings of the Board js published, the\ntax payers of the county will know who gets the\nmoney and foi what it is spent. The law does not\nmake it compulsory on the Board of Supervisors,\nbut says they may have it done; so the matter is\nnow up to the voters and tax payers of the county.\nIf you do not care anything about the proceedings\nbeing published each month, then you should vote\nagainst it, but on the other hand if you want the\nfull proceedings published, including all allow\nances, who made to, and for what services ren\ndered, then you should vote for the publishing of\nthe proceedings.\nThe voters should not lose sight of the fact\nthat it will coat something to enforce the dog law\nand the game law, and that the County Farm\nDemonstrator must be paid a salary and it will\ntake money to continue the work of the Horae\nEconomic Agent, and it will cost something to have\nthe f ull priCeedings of the Board of Supervisors\npublished; also, any advantages that might come\nfrom these thing should be considered and weighed\ncarefully by every voter in the county.\nWe are not informed as to the dog law and the\ngame law throughout the state, but more than two;\n*\n, m\nthirds of the counties of the st ate now have County\nFarm Demonstrators, Home Economic Agents\nand the proceedings of the Boaitd of Supervisors\npublished.\nGo to the polls next Saturday and vote your\nhonest convictions on these five questions that the\nBoard of Supervisors has been liberal enough to\nsubmit for your consideration, and we feel sure\nthat the wilt of the majority of those voting will be\ncarried out by the Board of Supervisors of the\ncounty.\nANOTHER BIG JOB\nIt was a great undertaking for the United\nStates to mobolize an army of four million men\nwithin eighteen months, but the plan was carried\nout and the work completed in a manner that not\nonly su rprised the nations of the earth, hut we\nwere also made to feel that almost a miracle had\nbeen performed when it was announced a few\nmonths ago by the War Department that more\nthan two million soldiers were in France, some in\nthe trenches and the balance ready to march to\nthe firing line and that more than two million sol- •\ndiers were being trained in this country. It was\na great task wre!l performed, but we have on our\nhands today a task as great, if not greater—that of\ndemobilization.\nT-V • _ 1 - _•__ _ _ r r_—_! 11 i ~ m 1 a n\niyi3Liuii fillip chi aiixi,y iwui uji j*uu uiv»i **-» «•*\nbig job. Every man, before being discharged,\nmust undergo a physical examination; detention\ncamps must be maintained; pay for the soldiers\nmust be arranged up to a certain time, and trans\nportation back to their homes must be perfected.\nThis is a big job even for the government to under\ntake: but that is not all. The government is going\nto see to it that the sending home of these millions\nof men will not, to any great extent, confuse the\ncommercial business of the country; they will be\n.sent back in such numbers that they can find their\n| way back into the regular channels of work so as\nI not to cause any section of the country to be over\ni run with labor. Another big job will be for the\ndry-goods houses of the country to be able to fur\nnish the returning soidiers with civilian clothes,\nand in order to help out along this line, the War\nDepartment has issued orders to the effect that,\na soldier may continue to wear his uniform for\nthree months after being discharged.\nGOOD BANK SHO WING\nOur editorial column had been closed last week\nbefore the stetementof the Bank of Wiggins was\nsent in for publication, and even though we are a\nweek late, we wish to call the attention of our\nreaders to this statement, which is by far the\nbiggest and best of any bank statement ey.gr\npublished in the county.\nWith a capital stock of only ten thousand dol\nlars, this bank is doing a tremendous big business.\nIndividual deposits are more than one hundred\nand twenty two thousand dollars, with time de\nposits of more than fifteen thousand dollars.\nThe statement shows loans and discounts of\nover sixty-five thousand dollars, which proves to\nus beyond a doubt that other people, besides the\nwriter, are being accomodated to money loans by\nthis bank. “Overdrafts none” speaks well for the\nmanagement of the bank.\nTaken as a whole, the Bank of Wiggins has a\nstatement and a record of which the people of\nthis county should feel justly proud and which re\nflects credit on those who have in charge the\ncarrying on of its business affairs.\nBETTER ST A Y AT HOME\nPresident Wilson is being urged to attend the\npeace conference which will meet in Europe at an\nearly date. While some are anxious for the Presi\ndent to go, yet others are slow to agree that it\nwould not be wise for our President to take the\nchances that would be necessary for him to take,\nif chrmlrl a ttontl fnn fprpnr\'P\nCol. House, who has been the President’s\nmouth-piece in the meetings thus far held across\nthe ocean, would perhaps convey the feeling an^\ninfluence of the President in the peace conference\nand thereby eleminate the chances of this nation,\nas well as the whole world, of losing one of the\ngreatest—if not the greatest—men of this age.\noooooo ooo\nSince writing theabove, it has been announced\nfrom Washington that President Wilson has de\ndecided to go to Europe and attend the peace\nconference. So it is settled that he will go,\nunless, after reading the above editorial, he should\nchange his mind.\nThere is a good man living near Wiggins who\nhas come to town every week for the past two\nmonths without a dollar in his pockets. If you\nask us why we know this to be true, it is simply\nbecause this good man came into the Enterprise\noffice two months ago and told us lie had read a\ncopy of our paper and lilted it fine; asked us to ;\nsend him the paper and said that he would hand\nus a dollar the very first time he came to town\nwith that much in his pocket. He’s a good honest |\nfellow but is just dead broke—that’s all.\n(\nThe names of only two presidents of these\nUnited States begin with the letter “W,” and\nthose two are the greatest. So our hat is off to\nthe letter “W” for without it we would have had 1\nno Washington or Wilson.\n\\ J V\n‘ - - r ; — « ■■■\nHEALTfl «r HYGIENE\ntjiythe STATE BOARD^HEALTH ^8^^\nI I_ftliiV»» ■< Jackson, Miss *- ... -n 13\n0\nVacations Without Typhoid\nThe late summer and early autumn\nalways bring the greatest amount of\ntyphoid fever. You can\'t attribute thl-i\nto the weather unless you are a hope\nless pessimist. It is clearly due to\nthe opportunity for Infection with ty\nphoid germs in the vacation season. It\nrequires from ten days to three weeks\nfor the Illness to come on after the\ntime of infection. That would ju;*t\nabout bring the victim home from va\ncation in time to come down with ty\nphoid fever.\nPeople off on vacation, or while trav\n•ling, often drink water without know\ning positively that it is not polluted by\nseepage from a privy in the vicinity.\nOn vacation in the country people\nare compelled to patronize such dining\nplaces as are available, and very often\nthese are filthy places where flies\nfairly compete with patrons for the\nfood. Flies do not live where cleanly\nconditions prevail. They must have\nfilth, and filth right handy by, to grow\nin—the eggs are deposited in uncov\nered manure heaps, unscreened garb\nage receptacles or other filth, espe\ncially In the open back privy. In a\nweek maggots develop from the eggs.\nWithin ten days adult flies are pro\nduced—ten days froln e^gs to flies.\nphoid germs. A “carrier” is a person\nwho has had typhoid fever, perhaps\nseveral years ago, and still dissemi\nnates the germs and is capable of in\nfecting other persons, though not at\npresent ill. Many of the most serious\nlocalized epidemics of typhoid fever in\nrecent years have been positively I\ntraced to “carriers” who prepared or\nserved the food.\nPolluted water, flies, carriers—thesa\nthree risks attend the individual off on\nvacation. The water ri.-k may gener\nally be avoided by refraining: fron\ndrinking by the wayside until you\nlearn definitely that the water is safe.\nTyphoid polluted water may be os\nclear and cold and pure otherwise an\ncould he desired, so mere taste is no\ncriterion.\nFlies, signifying filthy conditions,\nshould not be countenanced anywhere.\nFlies do not travel far from the filth\nin which they breed. If open back\nJ privies, unscreened garbage cans and\nl uncovered manure heaps are not per>\ni mitted to exist in the immediate vicin\n; ity of the house, flies will not appear,\ni Do not patronize a dining place where\n| flies are found—that is one factor ol\nI safety.\nCarriers you cannot guard against\n—. ■■ --t \' -\'A\nUnscreened dining rooms and kitch\nens are dangerous places, besides be\ning too filthy to patronize in any case.\nPeople so uncleanly as to harbor\nflies would naturally not bother their\nbeads much over sanitary matters in\ngeneral, so far as their patrons health\nis concerned. Hence they have no\nscruples about employing help they\ncare not whether a cook or a waitress\nor other person handling or serving\nfood happens to ho a “carrier" of ty\nWell, what are you going to do to bt\nsafe?\nThat is very simple.

I\nWiggins Electric Light Company', 'STEADIER HOC MARKETS RMWNED\nHog Producers and Packers Confer With Repre\nsentatives of the Food Administration and\nAgricultural Department and Adopt\nNew Plan of Regulation.\n, In accordance with the policy of the Food Administration since lta founda\ntion to consult representative men In the agricultural industry on occasion*\nof Importance to special branches of the Industry, en October 2-1 there wa*\nconvened In Washington a meeting of the Live Stock Subcommittee of th*\nAgricultural Advisory Board and the special members representing the *wl»*\nIndustry to consider the situation In the hog market.\n1 The conference lasted for three days, and during this time met with the\nexecutive committee of the fifty packing firms participating In foreign order*\nfor pork products and with the members of the Food Administration directing\nforeign pork purchases.\n■ The conclusions of the conference were as follows:\n; The entire marketing situation has\n^o changed since the September Joint\nconference as to necessitate an entire\n(alteration In the plans of price stabi\nlization. The current pence talk haa\nalarmed the holders of corn, and there\nhas been a price decline of from 25\ncents to 40 cents per bushel. The fact\n\'that the accumulations of low priced\ncorn In the Argentine and South Afrl\njca would, upon the advent of peace\nand liberated shipping, become avail\nable to the European market has cre\nated a great deal of apprehension on\nthe part of corn holders. This decline\nhas spread fear among swine growers\n► that a similar reduction in the prices\nof hogs would naturally follow. More\nover, the lower range of corn prices\n.would. If incorporated In a K?-to-l ra\ntio, obviously result In a continuously\n:fnlllng price for live hogs. In view\n,of these changed conditions many\nswine producers anticipated lower\nprices and as a result rushed their\nhogs to market In targe numbers, and\nithis overshipment has added to and\naggravated the decline.\nThe information of the Department\nof Agriculture indicates that the sup\nfply of hogs has increased about 8 per\ncent., while the highest unofficial esti\nmate does not exceed 15 per cent In\ncreased production over last year. On\n4he other hand, the arrival of hogs\nduring the last three weeks In the\nseven great markets has been 27 per\ncent more than last year, during the\ncorresponding period, demonstrating\nthe unusually heavy marketing of the\navailable supply. In the face of the\nexcessive receipts some packers have\nnot maintained the price agreed last\nmonth. On the other hand, many\n\'of the packers have paid over tho\n" price offered to them In an endeavor\nto maintain the agreed price. The re\nsult In any event has been a failure\nto maintain the October price basis\ndetermined upon at the September con\nference and undertaken by the pack\ners. Another factor contributing to\nthe break in prices during the month\nhas been the influenza epidemic; It\nhas sharply curtailed consumption of\npork products and temporarily de\ncreased tho labor staff of the packers\nabout 25 per cent.\nThe exports of 130,000,000 pounds\nof pork products for October com\npared with about 52,000,000 pounds\nIn October a year ago, and the\nexport orders placeable by the Food\nAdministration for November, amount\nto 170,000,000 pounds as contrast\ned with the lesser exports of\n08,000,000 for November, 1917. The\nIncreased demands of the allies are\ncontinuing, and are In themselves\nproof of the necessity for the large\nproduction for which the Food Admin\nistration asked. The increase in ex\nport demands appears to be amply\nsufficient to take up the increase in\nhog production, but unfavorable mar\nket conditions existing in October af\nford no fair index of the aggregate\n(supply and demand.\nIt must be evident that the enor\nmous shortage in fats in the Central\nEmpires and neutral countries would\nImmediately upon peace result In ad\nditional demands for pork products\nwhich, on top of the heavy shipments\nto the Allies, would tend materially\nto increase the American exports, In\nasmuch as no considerable reservoir of\nsupplies exists outside of the United\nStates. It seems proname uiat me\npresent prospective supplies would be\nInadequate to meet this world demand\nwith the return to peace. So far as it\nis possible to interpret this fact, it ap\npears that there should be even a\nstronger demand for pork products\nafter the war, and therefore any alarm\nof hog producers as to the effect of\n.peace is unwarranted by the outlook.\n| In the light of these circumstances\nft is the conclusion of the conference\nthat attempts to l*pld the price of hogs\nto the price of corn may work out to\nthe disadvantage of pork producers.\nIt is the conclusion that any Interpre\ntation of the formula should be a\nI)road gauged policy applied over a\nlong period. It is the opinion of the\nconference that in substitution of the\nprevious plans of stabilization the\nLive Stock Subcommittee of the Agri\ncultural Advisory Board, together with\n*he specially invited swine representa\ntives, should accept the invitation of\nthe Food Administration to Join with\nthe Administration and the packers in\ndetermining the prices at which con\ntrolled export orders are to be placed.\nThis will be regularly done. The In\nfluence of these orders will be directed\nto the maintenance of the common ob\nject—namely, the stabilization of the\nprice of live hogs so as to secure as far\nIt to possible fair returns to the\nproducer and the Insurance of an ade\nquate future supply.\nThese foreign orders are placed\nupon the basis of cost of hogs to the\npackers.\nAs the result of long negotiations\nbe1 ween this body and the Packers\'\nCommittee, representing the 45 to 60\npackers participating In foreign or\nders, together with the Allied buyers,\nal! under the Chairmanship of the\n1< ood Administration, the following un\ndertaking has been given by the pack\ners :\nIn vtew of the undertakings on the\npart of the Food Administration with\nlegard to the co-ordinated purchases\nof pork products, covered In the at\ntached, It Is agreed that the packers\nparticipating In these orders will un\ndertake not to purchase hogs for less\nthan the following agreed minimum!\nfor the month of November, that Is a\ndally minimum of $17.50 per hundred\npounds on average of packers\' droves,\nexcluding throw-outs. “Throw-outa"\nto be defined as pigs under 130\npounds, stags, boars, thin sows and\nskips. Further, that no hogs of any\nkind shall be bought, except throw\nouts. at less than $16.50 per hundred\npounds. The average of packers\'\ndroves to be construed as the average\nof the total sales In the market of al)\nhogs for a given day. All the above\nto be based on Chicago.\nWe agree that a committee shall be\nappointed by the Food Administration\nto check the dally operations In the\nvarious markets with a view to super\nvision and demonstration of the carry\ning out of the above.\nThe ability of the packers to carry\nout this arrangement will depend on\nthere being a normal marketing ot\nhogs based upon the proportionate in\ncrease over the receipts of last year.\nThe Increase in production appears to\nbe a maximum of about 15 per cent\nand we can handle such an Increase.\nIf the producers of hogs should, a«\nthey have In the past few weeks, pre\nmaturely market hogs In such increas\ning numbers over the above It la en\ntirely beyond the ability of the pack\ners to maintain these mlnlmums, and\ntherefore we must have the co-opera\ntion of the producer himself to main\ntain these results. It Is a physical\nImpossibility for the capacity of the\npacking houses to handle a similar\nover-flood of hogs and to find a market\nfor the output. The packers are anx\nious to co-operate with the producer*\nin maintaining a stabilization of price\nand to see that producers receive a fair\nprice for their products.\n(Signed) THOS. E. WILSON,\nChairman Packers\' Committee.\nThe plan embodied above was adopt\ned by the conference.\nThe Food Administrator has appoint\ned a committee, comprising Mr. Thomas\nE. Wilson, elinlrman of the Pack\ners’ Committee; Mr. Everett Brown,\npresident of the Chicago Livestock Ex\nchange; Major Itoy of the Food Ad\nministration, Mr. Louis D. Hall of the\nBureau of Markets, to undertake the\nsupervision of the execution of the\nplan in the various markets. Commis\nsion men are asked to co-operate In\ncarrying out the plan embodied In the\npackers\' agreement. It must be evi\ndent that offers by commission men to\nsell hogs below the minimum estab\nlished above is not fair, either to the\nproducer or the participating packers.\nMr. Brown has undertaken on behalf\nof the commission men In the United\nStates that they will loyally support\nthe plan.\nIt Is believed by the conference that\nling new yutu, uaseu nn ii is upuu a\npositive minimum basis, will bring bet\nter results to the producer than aver\nage prices for th^. month. It does not\nlimit top prices and should narrow\nthe margins necessary to country buy\ners In more variable markets. It la\nbelieved that the plan should work out\nclose to $18 average.\nSwine producers of the country will\ncontribute to their own Interest by\nnot flooding the market, for It must be\nevident that If an excessive over per\ncentage of hogs is marketed In any\none month price stabilization and con\ntrol cannot succeed, and It Is certain\nthat producers themselves can contri\nbute materially to the efforts of the\nconferences if they will do their mark\neting in as normal a way as possible.\nThe whole situation as existing at\npresent demands a frank and explicit \'\nassurance from the conferees repre\nsented—namely, that every possible\neffort will be made to maintain a live\nhog price commensurate with swine\nproduction costs and reasonable sell\ning values In execution of the declared\npolicy of the Food Administration\nto use every agency in Its control to\nsecure justice to the farmer.\nThe stabilization methods adopted\nfor November represent the best ef\nforts of tlje conference, concurred Iti\nby the Food Administration and the\n‘PLANT TREES’ IS\nNEW SLOGAN\n‘Plant YourvOrchard Week’\nDecember 2-7 To Be\nObserved\nMiss Pauline Quarles, Home\nEconomic Agent for Stone Coun\nty, gives the following in regards\nto the Mississippi’s “Plant Your\nOrchad Week’’ irom Dec. 2nd to\nDec. 7th.\nThe state agricultural exten\nsion force, both men and women,\nwhite and black, have decided to\ndevote the first week in Decern\nber to get planted out over the\nstate the largest possible num\nber of model home orchards.\nThe campaign is under the per\nsonal supervision of E.

In addition,\nthe Agricltural High Schools and\nother forces are expected to\nplant at least three hundred,\nmaking Mississippi’s goal one\nthousand trees.
