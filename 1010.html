        <pre>['[The Elk Mountain Pilot., VOL. XX., ELK MOUNTAIN PILOT., ISSUED EVERY TUESDAY., Entered nt the postoffice at Crested, Butte, Colorado, for transmission, through the mails as second-class, matter., Notk\'K: The 1*ii.ot carries no deml ndver, tisemcnta. Every advertisement will bocliurRed, for up to tin* date it i* ordered discontinue!., sTmiHin^Fissr^TEi: —, ONE YEAR, IN ADVANCE, - §2.00., •MX MONTHS, - * - - - §1.00., EDITORIAL COMMENT., Men who live on the line of fire, of a Kentucky feud are poor life, insurance risks., An important question has just, been settled in Le Mars, lowa., The board of supervisors has de, cided that an exchange is a bona, fide subscriber., The British campaign in the, Transvaal can be likened unto a, revival of the north-pole business,, because Great Britain is largely, engaged in sending expeditions to, the seene of the war to discover, missing generals ami expeditions, which have preceded them there., A revival of the old Irish organ, nations, which were exceedingly, effective in raising money, will, probably result from the uprising, of Irishmen the world over in sym, pathy with the Boers: but nothing, so ridiculous as an clFort to cap, ture Canada with a few hundred, inMtra loud noise and a brass hand, will ever occur again. m, The result in the Roberts cast* is, wholly in accordance witli morality, And common sense. His election, was a flagrant cletian the mor, al sense of the nation by the Mor, mon church and was deliberate in, its intent, a wilful insult flung fair, in the face of the American people, and designed to test whether fur, ther and more outrageous violations, of the agreement under which, Utah was admitted as a state would, Ik l advisable. The vote on Rob, erts’ exclusion was non-partisan, and very emphatic. Every Repub, lican in the house and two-thirds, of the Democrats voted against, him., Secretary Gage deserves the, praise of the miners and all people,, who believe in th& beneficent effect, of the increased use of silver, for, his proposition before the house, committee on coinage, weights and, measures. The Secretary pointed, out that the present demand for, fractional coin was so urgent that, the issue ran considerably beyond, the titty millions authorized by, law, and he recommended that this, legal restriction l>e repealed, .leav, ing the treasury to determine the, proportion of fractional coin neces, sary! It is at least fair to presume, that Mr. Gage believes in en, larging the issue to the full require, ments of business., Two most deplorable crimes in, Colorado have recently proclaimed, to the people of the United States, that the law of the state is not re, garded by our citizens as adequate, for all circumstances which may, arise, and that Colorado is one of, the states where law is not su, preme. The whole train of events, indicated a light estimation of the, seriousness of the taking of human, life, and a contempt for the ex, treme penalty provided by the, state law. No condition or defect, of the law can justify lynching;, nothing can excuse murder. But, involved in the responsibility for, both murder and lynching are the, legislators and voters who are com, mitting Colorado to an experiment, that the experience of mankind, has demonstrated to be a failure,, CRESTED BUTTE, GUNNISON COUNTY, COLORADO, JANUARY 30, 1900., Pernicious Journalism., The People’s Champion, lender, of the obstructionist element of this, county, which has become noted, for its opposition to the develop, ment and progression of the com, munity. some time ago contained, an article in relation to the insur, ance at the Crested Butte mine, in, which that paper claimed that the, insurance scheme was to be forced, upon the men regardless. The, Pilot promptly denied that any, force was to be applied, because we, did not believe the Colorado Fuel, & Iron company would use such, methods toward its employes, and, in addition we noted that the in, surance plan had been dropped at, the local mine. The Champion,, in its all-knowing wisdom, at once, reiterated that the insurance would, be forced upon the men in a ‘‘con, venient season when the company, can stand a strike.” The Pilot, then secured a statement from one, of the prominent general officers of, the company, the sum and sub, stance of which was, that the com, pany does not require their men to, insure anywhere, although it pre, fers that they should, as it is a, good thing for them, and at many, of the C. F. & I. Co., mines as well, as at nearly all metalliferous mines, and smelters in the state, such in, surance is carried. At a few places, some of the men object, and in, such cases it is not in force. Such, was the case at Crested Butte and, the insurance was discontinued,, and will not be put in unless the, men want it. If they never want, it, it will never be put in. At two, of the mines where men were kill, ed under circumstances which gave, them uo claim against the com, pany, their widows received in a, few days from the insurance, pan}\' SoOO and $(>00 each, very, much to the relief of their families, At these places the benefits have, been so apparent that the men, could not now be persuaded to go, without insurance. This is a state, ment of facts from authority, and, we opine that the Champion’s usual, baseless agitations will not cut any, figure with sensible people., Colorado Republicans can well, hope for success this year. From, all parts of the state come reports, of a revolt of thousands of voters, who have been enticed by fusion, during the past few years. They, havp become disgusted with tin, men and the parties they have been, looking to for relief and are ready, to turn once more to the party of, progress and American ideas. Ex-, Governor Eaton stated the matter, in the right light when he declared, that while the people of Colorado, had not departed from their ideas, on the silver question, they stood, with the administration on the, question of expansion, and on this, issue the Republican party will, win. The problems resultant from, (lie war will be the leading ones in, the coming campaign, and on these, the Republican party of Colorado, can score a victory., In private session, the Episcopal, clergy of Boston was recently ad, dressed by President Eliot, and, now the Rev. Mr. Frisby, a high, church Episcopal clergyman, re, bukes the clergy in question for, inviting a Unitarian to express, himself before them. “They have, offered,” he says, “a gratuitous in, sult to their divine Master in thus, calling in the unbeliever to in, struct them.” All this censure, was given vent simply because tlie, Unitarian told them he didn’t care, for their liturgy and said that he, thought their prayer-book needed, amending. No; it is a fact there, is never any peace, in the church, or out of it, even during the es, pecial period of good will toward, men, 1, Culture., Culture is a habit of mind, a, mental process that wide reading, and the memorizing of many facts, and dates does not necessarily be, get. In a general way, culture, may be defined ns an acquired, illumination enabling its possessor, to distinguish between the eternal, and the ephemeral, between the, significant and the irrelevant. True, culture carries one into the realms, of art, literature, science and social, life with a calm, judicial, sympa, thetic mind that is not clouded by, a feverish striving to know a little, about a great many things or a, great deal about little things., Culture is to mental activity what, real literature is to the printiug, press. As a nation wo have great, mental activity, but too little cul, ture. We print an enormous nupi, ber of newspapers, but not a great, many permanent good books. We, are inclined to forget that one, thought that clarifies our mental, vision is worth a thousand unre, lated facts, that one step toward, real culture is more to be desired, than a whole cycle of afternoon, teas. We should learn to give to, the book and to the newspaper, their appropriate places in our, daily lives. To him who reads, books worth the reading the daily, chronicle of contemi>orary events, gains a new interest. Today’s, newspaper, if 3*oll have read his, tory* aright, becomes not a mere, jnmble of more or less interesting, gossip, but a page in the diary’ of, the human race, voyaging it knows, not whither through wondrous seas., We should gain from great books, that enlightenment which shall, enablers to give to the crude de, tails in today’s news-columns their, comparative significance; to make,, as it were, the annals of the mo, ment submit themselves to tin 1, whole recorded course of human, history. When one lias gained, this power, acquired a culture that, unerringly separates the eternal 1, from the ephemeral, the significant, from the irrelevant, then does the, library seem more wonderfid be, cause of the newspaper, and tin*, newspaper a thing to be read be, cause of the library*., Senator McEnery. of La., differs, from his party colleagues in Iris, opinion of the war in the Philip-j, pines. He said, in a speech, this j, week: “I do not stop to inquire 1, now whether my country in the, Philippines is right or not; I do, not inquire who fired the first shot, which precipitated hostilities. It, is enough for me to know that my, government Ims been assailed, and, I will uphold its hands until its, enemies have been brought into, subjection.”, The Gunnison News, Industrial Edition, Will shortly* be issued., Parties desirous of having, write-ups of their mining, property, ranches, places, of business, etc., with, pictures of same or them, selves, please communi, cate with the News office, at once. The edition will, be the most elaborate ever, undertaken by a paper on, the western slope. You, will regret it if you are, not in it in some way., Several thousand copies, are to be printed.

OJ, course the service has grown, but its, rate of extension has been slow. Dur- j, lng the year covered by the report, lust submitted by the superintendent, ,cly one station was added, there be, ing at the date of the report 265 sta, tions. of which 193 were on the At, lantic and gulf coasts, 56 on the greal, lakes, 15 on the Pacific and one at ths, falls of the Ohio, Louisville, Ky. Ol, the 3,903 persons involved in disaster;, to documented vessels within the field, of the operations of the service during, the year only 56 were lost, and out ol, a total estimated value of vessels and, cargoes imperiled In the disasters, amounting to $8,104,640, there was, saved property valued at $6,261,900. j, The November statement of exports, of breadstuffs just issued by the treas, ury department shows a larger quan, tity of corn exported in the eleven, months ending with November, 1899,, than in the corresponding months of, any preceding year, and at a higher, rate per bushel than in any year since, 1895. The total exports of corn in the, oleven months ending with November,, 1899, were 185.532.659 bushels, valued, at $74,742,127, while in the corre, sponding months of last year the 185,-, 284,340 bushels exported only brought, $68,513,147, the average export price, in the eleven months of 1899 being 40, cents per bushel, against 37 cents in i, 1898. and 31 cent 3 In the correspond, ing months of 1897. That the growth, has been steady and rapid is shown, by a comparison of the figures of 1898, and 1899 with those of 1893 and 1894. !, In 1893, the exports of corn in the ], eleven months ending with November ., were 48,602,183 bushels, and in 1894,, 37,910,232 bushels, the total for 1898, and 1899 being more than four times, as much as that of 1893 and 1894. In, cornmeal the growth is equally rapid,, the exports during the eleven months, of 1894 being 237,095 oarrels, while in, the eleven months of 1899, they have, been 798,111 barrels., Charles Kingsbury Miller has sent a, petition to every member of congress, asking the passage of a law to forbid, the use of the national flag in the prize, ring and in commercial advertising, Among the signers of the petition are, said to be Admirals Dewey and Schley., Benjamin Harrison, Levi P.

It is high time, however, tUat, the serious view should be considered,, and that the opponents of the adminis, tration should be called upon to formu, late their policy In a positive state, ment. That the speeches of Senator, Hour and others, telegraphed to Hong, Kong and thence to Manila, encour, aged Agulualdo and his followers, and, that the continuance of the insurrec, tion, and the blood of General Lawton, and many others is directly chargeable, to these treasonable encouragements of, the armed enemies of our country, has, been put beyond a doubt. It is time, now to stop the foolishness., The so-called anti-imperialists differ, among themselves as to the policy to, be pursued; but one thing all of them, apparently are united on: that the, United States, when It abandons the, Philippines to Aguinuldo and the, llong Kong junta, shall guarantee that, no other nation shall put a stop to the, anarchy which would naturally result, from the withdrawal of the United, States forces, or take possession of the, islands or any part thereof, for tin*, time of ten years at least. This is the, most definite proimsition upon which, all the anti-imperialists appear to be, united. This Is a policy which can, only be characterized as a dog-lu-the, manager policy. Does any one imagine,, who lias any sense, that the other na, tions who would be glad to get pos, session of the islands would acknowl, edge for a moment the right of the, United States to withdraw from them,, and at the same time announce to the, world that no other nation should take, them? So long as we hold the Islands,, other nations acknowledge our right to, do so: but the moment we withdraw,, and allow the natives to make war oil, each other undisturbed, to violate the, rights of traders, to pillage and mas, sacre at their will, other nations are, bound to see that the rights of their, subjects arc protected, and they will, do so; and If we should uiulertnke to, prevent them we should have on our, hands a world-wide war., The guaranty which the anti-imperi, alists propose, therefore, is a guaranty, of war with England and Germany and, Russia and probably France, ull 111 the, interests of peace. A more absurd, proposition was never formulated by, u man insane., There is not a single nntl-imperlalist,, so far as their utterances disclose, who, would have tills country simply with, draw from the Philippines and leave, them to their fate. Every one wants, the United States to guarantee them, from interference by any other power., Such a guaranty Involves all the re, sponsibilities and none of the benefits, which would come from on occupa, tion by this country. That the Fili, pinos would have under our govern, ment a larger measure of individual, freedom, a better administration of, justice, and a better chance to "life,, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”, than under the dictatorship of an, Agulnaldo, is not worth arguing. The, question is whether this country, hav, ing undertaken a responsibility, shall, fittink it. There is but one answer to, such a question that can be given, by the American people, and If Mr., Bryan jnA the majority of the Demo, crats in their next national convention, shall declare that this country ought, to adopt any such course as Is now, proposed by the Democratic leaders, who seem to have most influence in the, party, the popular verdict in the next, election will be so overwhelming that, the party will need a quarter of a, century more to recruit its shattered, forces enough to make a respectable, contest., WOLCOTT THE PHILIPPINES, Senator Wolcott\'s reply to Senator, Pettigrew on the Philippine question, was a scathing and timely rebuke to, the gentleman from South Dakota and, his fellow American Tagalos, who are, banging away with their blunder, busses at the administration, notwith, standing. as Senator Wolcott says,, there is "not an honest Democrat who, did not admit that if his party were in, power tlie first thing to be done would, be to crush the insurrection.”, The Colorado senator said: ‘‘Scat, tered through every community there, were tlie discontented and uuhappj’, people who had not been successful, and who viewed with suspicion and, hatred all those whose lives had been, crowned with success, who behind ev, ery good action looked for a lurking,, sinister purpose.” The people are fit, tingly represented in the United States, Senate by sueli a man as Pettigrew,, for "during all the years I have known, him,” stated Senator Wolcott, ‘‘l never, knew him to say a kind or friendly, word about a single person or a single, cause.”, Senator Woleott warmly defended, the position of tlie President, who lias, taken no step “that did not reflect, honor upon tlie people of tlie United, States.” lie read from the President\'s, message tlie extract about tlie duty of, the government after the insurrection, was over, to spare "no effort to build, up the waste place,” "to open schools, and churches.” "to foster trade ana, industry,” and concluding with the, words that it was "their liberty, not, our power, which we are seeking to, enhance.”, In speaking of attitude of the, United States toward the Philippines,, Senator Wolcott maintained that we, took the islands "not as a conquest, but, as one of the highest duties we owed, the human race.” He upheld the re, tention of tlie Philippines upon the, high grounds of humanity and not be, cause of their value to us in dollars, and cents., His address, while not a studied, speech, was a notable one. as all of, Senator Wolcott\'s utterances are. He, showed that the United States govern, ment owes It to itself and to the na, tives that it establish pence and good, government in the islands, and that, our first duty, in carrying out such a, policy, is to quell the insurrection.—, Denver Times., Pettllent Pettigrew., In tlie Senate yesterday Pettigrew, pettigrewed with even more than bis, habitual pettlgrcwness. He said that, Mr. McKinley liad laid himself open to, impeachment and had acted by order, of tlie British government. He swat, ted tlie British government, "the ig, norance and sycophancy of the British, people,” the "miserable, contemptible, rot” of Rudyard Kipling. British rule, In Egypt, and other things to numerous, to mention. He said that white men, couldn’t live iu the tropics, a saying, characteristically pettigrew. By the, side of Pettigrew even Billy Mason, seems to have almost a rudimentary, intelligence and a faint glimmering of, reason.- N. Y. Sun., No Cover Necessary., The administration seems determined, to allow tlie "aunties” to fire all their, ammunition before answering, but, there will be a broadside when it does, come. After witnessing the operations, since the beginning of the Spanish, war no rational citizen really believes, that there is any necessity for the ad, ministration to cover up auythiug.—, Minneapolis Tribune., Bryan and Kentucky., Bryan denies the report that he urged, tlie Democrats of Kentucky to respect, the will of the people of the state as, expressed iu tlie election. The story, was Improbable oil its face. Bryan is, not the man who would raise his hand, to prevent his party from committing, a fraud if lie thought that the fraud, would give it control of any Important, office. Still, if Goebel steals the gov, ernorship, Bryan and his party may, bid a long good-by to power In Ken, tucky.—St. Louis Globe-Democrat., The Danish West Indies., The Cincinnati Commercial Tribune,, the leading Republican paper of Ohio,, says, audit tin* proposition to purchase, the Danish West India islands: "The, islands are on the market, the price is, reasonable, they will add completeness, to our system of coaling and harbor, stations in western waters. The evi, dent conclusion would seem to be that,, regardless of any other consideration,, they are a desirable purchase.”, A Disciple., In a sermon on ‘‘Creeds and Trusts” a, 1 Chicago clergyman, the Rev. Alexan, der Kent of the People’s Church, put, forth tlie novel theory that religion and, 1 theology are the sources of trusts. If, the taiill was tlie mother of trusts, as, lias been asserted, lie declared, then he, was ‘‘justified in saying that populur, theology is the grandmother of trusts.”, .vs the tariff is not tlie mother of trusts,, Mr. Kent’s very interesting theory, falls.—New York Sun., 1, 1, !, !, -1, \', I, t, \', i, 1, i, Froth, The earnest efforts made by the Pres, ident and his Cabinet to get action out, of Congress for the establishment of a, government in ruerto Rico is a suffi, cient answer to the outcry made by, Oliver Belmont in a December maga, zine in which he accused tlie admin, istration of a plot to prevent any dis, position of Puerto Rico at the present, session of Congress., According to the I’opoerntic theory,, McKinley desires to be a dictator in, our new possessions and Belmont even, suggested that Congress would be in, vlted to append a new title to the, President. lie would be hereafter, styled “President of the United States, and Emperor of the Philippines and, Puerto Rico.” The amount of cheap, froth that has been emitted from the, jaws of the traducers of the adininis, trztion since the adjournment of the, last Congress iu connection with its al, leged “Imperialism” is incalculable, Nebraska State Journal., Copperheads of To-day., The copperheads will be a little slo\\t, about putting themselves in tlie way of, getting another drubbing like tlie one, they got on the Pettigrew proposition., In fact, the copperheads are about ns, feeble to-day as they were in 18(51-05., They are feebler, indeed, than they, were at one time during that period., They carried several northern states, in 1802 and 1803, and ran the Demo, eratlc national convention in 1804., They failed to run tlie country then,, however, and they will fail now.—St., Louis Globe-Democra*, TELEGRAPH ITEMS., The Paris exposition will open April, 15th., A college for Finns has been dedi, cated at Haughton, Michigan.
