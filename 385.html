Hut wider discontent or mis\ntrust is caused by the fact that the\nwar office devotes its energies to\n! work that, in view of the crisis.\nshould properly go to civilian organi\nzat ions.\nThe task of looking after the forces\nfa France. transferring colonial\ntroops and getting up supplies means\na heavy tax on the war office organi\n, zatloii. The training of territorials,\ni or militia, who are now in encamp\n\' nienis, is an additional burden.

It simply\ncoordinates and uses the civilian\nmachinery and capacities which exist.\n"Local administrative officers," the\nwriter adds, "could Wi ll take charge\nof raising the quota of troops for\n\'each district and arrange for their\ncamps and provisioning Local medl-\ncal men might also physically exam\n! ine applicants who are now sent from\nthe country on long train journeys to\nmilitary stations Local doctors.
