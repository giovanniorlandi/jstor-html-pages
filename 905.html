Senator Park\nTrammell, who was one of the sena\ntors who led the fight in the Senate in\nopposition to Senator Newberry be\ning seated, made some of the ablest\nand most forceful speeches that were\nheard during the consideration of the\ncase. In the closing hours of the de\nbate Senator Trammell in concluding\nhis address said:\n"Since my early entrance into polit\nical life I have always had an aver\nsion to the corrupt use of money in\nconnection with campaigns. I have\nfelt that the lavish use of money was\ndestructive to and calculated to under\nmine the very foundations of our gov\nernment; that it would in course of\ntime, if permitted and encouraged; re\nsult in the overthrow of those bul\nwarks upon which rests the destiny of\nthe nation. So far as maintaining a\nrepresentative government is concern\ned, the American people have their\nsecurity and their safety only in the\nballot box. If we are going to permit\nmoney to be used to purchase influ\nence, to purchase votes, and in that\nway to defeat the unfettered, the free,\nhonest and patriotic will of the people\nof any state, then we destroy the very\nrock upon which rests the destiny of\nthe republic.\n"Now, senators, the question of Mr,\nNewberry personally is not the para\nmount and primary one. The big\nAmerican question is whether or not\nthe United States Sjenate is going to\nI place itself upon record as approving,\ncondoning and commending the pur\nchase of a seat in the United States\nSenate by Mr. Newberry himself, by\nhis family, or by anyone else at an\nacknowledged cost of at least $200,\n000. Some of you may give your ap\nproval, but as for me, I condemn with\nout reservation \'the boodle,\' \'the bar\nrel,\' and corrupting campaign, result\ning in the nomination and election of\nTruman H. Newberry to a seat in this\nbody. His commission is tainted all\nover with corruption. He should not\nbe seated. The Senate should not ap\nprove of this campaign which recorded\nthe greatest election scandal known to\nAmerican politics."\nIMPORTING NEWSPAPER FROM\nNORWAY INTO AMERICA\n(Associated Press)\nAstoria, Oregon, Jan. 18.

Mr.\nMcKenzie pointed out that the turbine\nunit of the plant was the only unit\ncapable of carrying the peak load of\nthe city at present and that in case\nof a breakdown or shut down of this\nunit for adjustment or repair, the\nother equipment was not adequate to\nsupply the needs of the town. Mr. Mc\nKenzie also called the attention of the\ncouncil to the urgent need of repairs\non the boilers at the plant and stated\nthat it was impossible to do this work\nunder present existing conditions be\ncause the boilers were so close to\ngether that although a boiler was not\nunder steam and not in use it was too\nhot to work in or on. Mr. McKenzie\nalso called attention to the need of a\nlarger spray pond and a water soften\ning plant for the entire water supply\nof the city. In closing his report he\nrecommended that the city purchase a\nnew boiler and a new turbine unit at\nonce and that it consider the new\nspray pond and water softening plant.\nThe council called upon Mr. R. A.\nBurford Jr., who was present at the\nmeeting, to give a rough estimate of\nthe cost of a new boiler with settings\nfor two boilers and an addition to the\nbuilding in order to house them.

Some advised a\nbond issue, while others advocated\nraising the present water rate to a\nminimum of $5 per quarter.\nDr. Henry moved that the chairman\nof the public service department in\nvestigate these much needed improve\nments and repairs and what the in\ncrease in revenue would be from a\nhigher water rate and report at the!\nnext meeting of the council.\nMr. Sistrunk then read the report\nof City Manager McKenzie on the\nstreet and sanitary departments.\nMr. S.

First, he asked that\nthe small chemical truck be equipped\nwith new wheels as the present rear\nwheels were giving way under the\nweight of the truck. Second, he point\ned out that the city needed a new\ntruck in its fire fighting equipment.\nHe said that the city is not prepared\nto fight a bad fire and that we badly\nneed a combined hose, chemical and\npumper. Third, he asked that the men\nin his department be given higher\nsalaries. He pointed out that altho\'\nthe police force worked only 12 hours\na day, each man drew $100 a month.\nHe said his fire fighters worked 24\nhours a day for $75 a month and ask\ned that he pay of the fire boys be\nraised.

The roof was leaking\nso badly that Mr. Pedrick described it\nas "leaking outside the jail and rain\ning inside."

The covin\ncil gave Mr. Pedrick the job of seeing\nthat both matters were attended to.\nThen the matter of the Silver\nSprings panhandle election was\nbrought up.

Hooper, Prop.\nThe spring of 1919 found meat pro\nduets still high, but everything else\ngoing up by leaps and bounds.\nThe wholesale grocers heard the\nhue of the meat gamblers in the west\nand the cry of the tenderloin steak\neaters of the east, whom their retail\ners were robbing. Hence the rumblings\nj began Jn Washington.\nI In the normal development of the\npacking business, and to get the\ncheapest service for themselves in\ncollecting from every state all the\nsurplus meats of our farmers, and in\nredistributing in the best and cheap\nest manner the finished products, the\npackers had spent many millions in\nequipment. Such equipment, in off\n" il i i a a\nmasons in tne meat trade could in\npart be employed in handling canned\nfruits and thus by using in another\nline idle equipment, designated for\nthe meat trade, the packers might cut\nthe cost of meats to the public, or cut\nthe cost of canned fruits to the pub\nlie.\nEven though the idle equipment, so\ngiven additional use, might seem to\nplay a small part in the handling of\ncanned fruits, yet when you know of\nthe millions thus invested the small\npercentage of economic saving to the j\npublic might be very large; and when!\nthe power to withhold from the public\nall proper benefit of such saving is\nfortified in the hands of the packers\nby a lack of adequate competition, it\nis time for the public to sit up and take\nnotice; to the end that the people do\nget a fair share of such savings,\nv.i\'ch big brains and big money are\nable to make by joining one line of\nbusiness with another.\nWhen it comes to a question of\nwhich bunch of millionaires is to be\nallowed to extract from the public the\nprofits in any line of goods the state\nis not called upon to act.\nWhether fifty millions in money are\nowned by one man, or that same mon\ney be owned by two hundred men,\nthus possessing $250,000 each, is after\nall of secondary concern to the. com\nmon citizen; but how that money is\nemployed is of first importance to all.\nIt is to the interest of the common\npeople to use, not to destroy, all the\nmeans of economic savings as they\nmust be developed by capital with the\naid of intelligence; thus the public\nmay serve its own good for the day,\nwithout cutting off from the future\nPhil Armours the hope for some fair\nrewards from any great economic sav\ning which their brains may hereafter\ndevise.\nThese views were not held by the\nbig wholesale grocers in the spring of\n1019; so taking courage from the hue\nin the west and the cry in the east,\nbut with no thought to benefit anyone\nbut themselves, they took their trou\nbles to Washington; hence the rumbl\nings began there.\nThe heavy governmental artillery,\nwas thus unlimbered and brought to\nplay on the packers, and the huers\nand the cryers and the public got\nbuncoed, as is abundantly proved by\nactual results now obvious to all men.\nThose who may try to defend the\npolicies pursued by the government\ntoward the packers in 1919, if any\nsuch can now be found, cannot say\nthat the decline in the prices of cat\ntle, hogs and sheep may fairly be at\ntributed to reatcion from war prices,\ntributed to reaction from war. prices,\ncurred until the summer of 1920, and\nthe end of 1921 still found the farm\ners giving ten calf skins, or five cow\nhides, for a decent hat or pair of\nshoes. -\nDuring all this time, too, the farm\ners and consumers paid prices far\nabove even war levels for almost ev\nerything they used.\nThis was not a party matter and\nwas not to be treated in a partizan\nway. ihe farmers and the producers\nneed little help from the government,\nbut they need to be left in a position\nwhere they may help themselves.\nThey are not beggars to ask for their\nsupport at -the expense of other\nclasses; but when the government\nfinds out that drastic means must be\nused to cripple those who offer the\nonly adequate outlet for their surplus\nsupplies, public interest demands that\nbefore the government acts to correct\nsuch abuses it first should make sure\nthat other adequate outlets are in\nworking order, for the shock of tiding\nover the time until some pet theory\nmay wor kout may be too hard for the\nproducers; and they are the life blood\nof the state.\nIn the summer of 1919, when I\nheard these governmental rumblings,\nI wrote from my sick room in Denver\na letter, which was published in the\nStar, and called to the attention of\nmy people the importance to them of\nthis subject, which was then pending.\nIn that letter I asked any one who\ndoubted me to consult Mr. John L. Ed\nwards. Mr. Waldo Martin or Mr. Z. C.\nChambliss, who was then living.\nThus I hoped to arouse some inter\nest in a question of first importance\nto our county and our state. The\nboard of trade took no action.\nI am now told that both senators\nand all our congressmen supported\nwith no benefit to the public, and\nwhich appear to have contributed in\na large way to the ruin of the farm\ning interests throughout our nation.\nI will close this subject in my next.\nSincerely yours,\nWilliam Hocker.\nOcala, January 12, 1922.\nChiropractic for stomach, kidney\nand liver troubles, rheumatism and\nother physical ailments.

But, ah, on the seventh!\nThis history has to do with the\nseventh.\nAt four o\'clock on Sunday after\nnoon, Minnie took her tan suit off its\nwire banger, dragged her hatbox from\nunder the bed and unearthed a smal\nand scarcely worn pair of tan pumps.\nWhile she discards the sateen shirt\nwaist for the tan outfit, we will dis\ncuss her.\nMinnie lived in a hall bedroom, with\na small iron bed, oak bureau, wash\nstand, bowl and pitcher, a straight\nback chair and two feet of floor space.\nShe cooked her breakfast, which in\nvariably consisted of a boiled egg and\ntwo toasted soda crackers, over the\ngas Jet, and there were a pewter spoon\nand a china egg cup on the window\nledge. She shared the fire escape with\nthe occupant of the adjoining room,\nand on the small iron landing outside \'\nthe window she kept a jar of jam and\na stewpan. There were three pink\npaper roses in a glass vase on Min\nnie\'s bureau and a paper-back copy\nof "Lady Audley\'s Secret" Inserted\nbeneath the mirror to give it the de\nsired tilt. It was to this that Minnie\nreturned six out of her seven evenings.\nBut thare Is a saving circumstance.\nOn the seventh day Minnie emerged\nfrom her chrysalis and black sateen\nshirt waist like a Moth Emporatus,\nand the six days of Biggest Store were\nleft to the empty c-?oon of the week.\nFrom Four Until Eight O\'clock Sun\nday Minnie Stradolis Ceased to Be.\nFrom four until eight o\'clock each Sun\nday Minnie Stradolis ceased to be;\nsimultaneously she discarded the sa\nteen shirtwaist for the tan suit, and\nthe weary yesterdays for the glowing\nhour which was the beacon of all the\nweary ones that preceded it.\nAt each week end there was one dol\nlar and thirty cents In Minnie\'s tan\npurse; that meant a club steak, shoe\nstring potatoes, and tip, in a gold hotel\ndining room, with shaded candles and\nhidden music. To be sure, the one\ndollar and thirty cents represemed\nslightly over one-fifth of her week\'s\nearn hies, seven hungry noon hours and\ntortuous walks from the Biggest Store\nto the hall room, but those homely se\ncrets were her own.\nWhen she strolled Into the marble\n16bby of the highest-storied and highest-priced\nhotel on Broadway she was\nflushed with a beauty that is corn\ninonly born of morning sleep and ims\nsage; when she established herself,\nas was her wont, in a quiet corner of\none of the numerous and perfumed\nparlors, she was a daughter of For\ntune, fresh from her bath of milk and\nrose leaves. Who could know that she\nwas awaiting the grand climax of her\nweek, and that when the crowds cam\'\nfastest and the lights were bright et\nshe would venture into the gold dining\nroom for one hour one dollar and\nthirty cents\' worth of dreamland that\nhad cost her six days of aching feet\nbehind tht nntlnn ennntor\' Tt 5c rma\nthat at ten o\'clock Cinderella was once\nmore in the small iron bed. but the\nbeacon\' light of an unborn seventh day\nwas shining truly across the week\'s\nchasm.\nToday Minnie put the finishing\ntouches to her toilet with lingering\ncare; she drew the neat-fitting .:iat\namis\' around her tiijure and resranled\nOur repair work is guaranteed sat-\niafactory.

She even\nrehearsed the racy moment when the\nsteel of her knife sank deep into the\nred of the steak, the quiet dignity of\nher "Keep the change," and the ob\nsequious bow of the waiter. The new\nboarder In the adjoining room lurched\nnoisily about, and with the weariness\nborn of experience she closed the win\ndow which opened out on the joint\nfire-escape landing and turned the key\nin the bureau drawer which contained\nher Bible and mother-of-pearl card\ncase; incidentally she turned her back\non Minnie.\nThere is a parlor in the highest\npriced and highest-storied hotel . on\nBroadway, which Is done in pale gold\nand pink ; it Is like a small, rare jewel\nbox softly tufted in satin and lighted\nwith opal globes; through Its graceful\nly hung doors you can see Into the\nglistening iooby beyond, but the only\nsounds that penetrate are strains of\nfar-away music and the soft swish of\nwomen\'s gowns.\nWithin this golden retreat Minnie\ndropped into the soft embrace of a\nbrocade divan and gave herself np to\nits luxury; closing her eyes ever so\nslightly she could imagine herself\njourneying through Lady Audrey\'s gar\ndens, In a gold and crystal sedan chair,\nwith a graceful ennui in her pose and\ncalla lilies in her hair. The hush of\nvelvet rugs and faint music lulled Min\nnie\'s dreaming senses, her tense hold\non the tan nurse one Hniiai- ja tfalr-\n.v relaxed, and she nestled\ndeeper in the pink brocade.\nnan in a irock coat and sniny\n\'patent shoes dropped wearily on the\nfarthest end of the divan. His hair\nw.is gray at the temples and his eyes\nwere surfeited with too much living ;\nhe was the typical clubman and dilet\ntante of the seventh-day world.\nMinnie regarded him with the little\nintake of breath which proximity to\nthose of his sphere invariably caused\nher. From the supercorrect cut of\ncoat to the shining fingernails he be\nspoke Inverness coats and cabs. Min\nnie did not exactly know what consti\ntuted an Inverness coat, but no drawing-room\nnovel was complete without\none. She could also picture this tired\neyed man in the dark mahogany quiet\nof his den, or strolling the white and\nbrass deck of a yacht. Her half-closed\neyes to all Intent and purpose were\nregarding an oil painting which hung\nbeyond his head, but none of his de\ntails was lost upon her; she knew that\nhis cane had a gun-metal knob and\nthat his shirt studs were gold.\nShe had rehearsed her hour for so\nlong that she was not even surprised\nwhen he leaned toward her and spoke.\n"That is a very warm and rich tit\nof work. You admire his school?" He\nreferred to the oil painting, and his\ntones were deep and serious.\n"It\'s Just beautiful," replied Minnie,\nwho had not even observed the por\ntrait. Her temples were throbbing violent\nly. She felt that she was contaminat\ning this seventh-day creature in even\nreplying, and that he would resent her\nif he knew, just as she resented Mr.\nSnuggs In the white goods.\n"I see you riding in the park quite\noften. Only a few mornings ago I was\nbold enough to canter after you, ad\nmiring your mount."\n"Thank you," she replied, taking the\nplunge and tilting her small head a bit.\n"The women in my. family have al\nways ridden well."\n"If you bespeak the race, I doubt it\nBOt."\nHe spoke the words with a patrician\ngrace that thrilled her; she groped for\na suitable reply, but none came. There\nwas a pause; she observed that he\nwore a crested ring on his right hand.\nShe felt it Incumbent upon her to jus\ntify her unattended presence, and\nglanced with well-restrained impa\ntience Into the lobby beyond.\nHe was on his feet immediately.\n"You are waiting for some; one. Can\nI be of any assistance?"\n"Thank you; no. My maid will be\nhere presently; she Is unnecessarily\nlong."\nShe sank back and let her eyes rest\non a misty landscape framed In silver.\nHe followed her gaze.\n"I have the twin Corot to that rare\nbit in my private collection.

Shealy,\nto assemble in Ocala Saturday, Jan.\n14, 1922, for the purpose of organizing\nan educational association for the\ncounty.\nThe various schools of the county\nbeing represented, at 11 o\'clock the\nsuperintendent called the meeting to\norder in the club room of the Profes\nsional and Business Women\'s Club.\nSupt. H. G. Shealy was elected tem\nporary chairman and Mr. G. Fred Tur\nner was elected acting secretary.\nNominations for president having\nbeen called for, the names of Messrs.\nH. G. Shealy and J. E Willet were\ngiven. Mr. Shealy was elected. Miss\nMamie Sheppard was unanimously\nelected secretary-treasurer.\nThe purpose of the meeting having\nbeen entered into by the. president, it\nwas suggested by him and decided\nthat the organization be termed the\nMarion Educational Association, and\nthat a fee of 50 cents be charged for\nmembership.\nThe association was honored by the\npresence of some of Marion\'s strong\neducational characters, such as Mr. J.\nE. Willet, the live principal of the\nDunnellon school; Miss Mary Shep\npard, the successful superintendent of\nthe Ocala schools; Miss Nellie Stev\nens, the veteran primary instructor of\nthe state, and many others. These able\nspeakers needed no further prepara\ntion when it came to discussing the\neducational welfare of the county and\nstate.\nMiss Margaret Taylor suggested\nthat the association adopt the slogan,\n"Marion County Schools the Best\nSchools,\' \'and ably discussed the im\nportance of adopting the slogan.\nMr. Willet set forth the requisites\nof school text books, mentioning the\ndefects of the present course and\nspoke very forcibly for a proper re\nadjustment of the system.\nMrs. Rex Todd led a lively discus\nsion for the betterment of schools\nand their separation from politics, be\ning strongly endorsed by Miss Shep\npard and others. Also Mrs. Todd and\nMiss Sheppard stated that different\ncounty teachers\' organizations were\ntoo independent of each other and\nthat some means of co-operation\nshould be employed. Mr. Willet sug-:\ngested that a legislative committee be\nappointed to get in touch and form\nsome plan whereby the various county\norganiaztions could co-operate with\neach other. It was recommended that\nMr. Willett be made chairman of this\ncommittee.\nMr. C. H. Shriner, principal of the\nAnthony school, mentioned the bene\nfits to be derived from the association\nand expressed the necessity of full at\ntendance at the meetings to make the\nassociation a success.\nThe association decided to meet\nmonthly and that an opportune time\nwould be the Saturday after the regu\nlar board meeting,-which will be Sat\nurday after the first Monday in each\ninonth.\nThe president appointed Miss Mar\ngaret Taylor, Miss Etta Burleson and\nMr. J. E. Willett a committee on pro\ngram, and Miss Nellie Stevens, Miss\nMamie Sheppard and Mr. C. H. Shri\nner a committee to draw up constitu\ntion and by-laws.\nVarious invitations having been re\nceived for the place of the next meet\ning, the one from Mr. Willet in behalf\nof Dunnellon was accepted.\nThe business session over, the asso\nciation adjourned for a social recess\nduring which time those who wished\nto join the association, which included\npractically all present, paid their dues\nand received their receipts.\nAbout the close of the registration\nwe heard the old familiar cry, "Dinner\nis ready." Turning around we saw\ntables arranged and a place for every\none. Every one was comfortably seat\ned; then came bowls of delicious oy\nster stew, of which there was plenty,\nfollowed by cake and coffee. As those\npresent lingered around the tables,\nsipping the coffee, it seemed like a big\nreunion and in fact, so it was, for the\nteachers of the county are one family\nand it does them good to meet with\nother teachers and enjoy the social\nfeatures of the association4 as well as\nthe good derived from the discussions\nThe association then adjourned to\nmeet in regular session in Dunnellon,\nSaturday, Feb. 11, 1922. The presi\ndent urges every teacher in the county\nto be present and to become a member\nof the association. Every one express\ned themselves as having had an ex\nceedingly good time and with many\nthanks to those who did so much to\nmake the day a success. Meet us in\nDunnellon. G.
