This\nquestion, ascribed with entire\ncredibility to "a well-known of\nficial of the empire" by Mr.\nSwope of the World\'s staff, rec\nently returned from Berlin, is so\neasily answered by everybody\nexcept Gcnnans that their fail-1\nure seemingly due, in spite of\ntheir intelligence, to real inabil\nityto find the right reply,\nranks high among the great\nmysteries of this time.\nThe widespread antagonism\nwhich grieves as well as enrages\nthe Germans for they are in\nsome ways curiously sensitive\nto outside opinion, though they\nso often defy and outrage it\nfinds no explanation for them in\nanything done to advance im\nmediate German interests, be\ncause they regard such acts as\nnecessarily proper, and even as\nadvantageous, at least indirect\nly, to " the rest of the world."\nThat is their defense, of course,\nfor the culminating crime now\nin process of commission in\nBelgium, and it is not in logic\nthat they err, for the propriety\nof the expatriations is a con\nclusion that rests securely on\nthe premise that the strength of\nthe German armies may be,\nshould be, and must be increased\nby all possible means.\nSo obvious is this to them that\nto the admirably worded and\nreasoned refusal of the Municip\nal Council at Tournai to assist\nthe removal to Germany -of the\ntown\'s men by turning in a list\nof their names the German\nGeneral in charge of the district\nanswered only that "the military\nauthority commands and the\nmunicipality has to obey." As\nthe municipality, in spite of this\nclear and simple statement of\nthe situation, did not obey, a\nheavy fine was promptly im\nposed and exacted. The only\neffect, therefore, of the refusal\nto assist in the enslavement of\nthe Belgian people was the pro\nviding of their conquerors with\nanother excuse for plunging into\nGIFTS THAT\nOMR\nWhat can be better than a dainty Handkerchief.\nWe have them at 2ia, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50 and $1.00\na piece or kid gloves at 1.00 and $1.25 a pair.

McCAUSLAND\nstill deeper poverty those al\nready reduced to dependence on\nthe charity of that "rest of the\nworld" whose failure to side\nwith Germany so puzzles the\nGermans.\nFrom the unalterable German\npoint of view, setting Belgians\nto work in Germany, like the\nsinking of the Lusitania, is justi\nfied by "military necessity,"\nand there is something the mat\nfpr with everybody for whom\ni justification is not complete\nt\nNew York limes.\nWormy Hogs are Neither Profit\nable Nor Healthy.\nHogs become infested with\nworms by picking up the eggs\nwith the food or in drinking\nwater. Therefore to lessen the\nopportunities for the hogs to be\ncome infested they should be\nkept in clean, well-drained lots\nand should be supplied with\nfresh, clean drinking water and\nnot allowed to drink from ponds\nand mud-wallows. Fresh slack\nN\ned lime sprinkled freely over the\nlots occasionally will help to de\nstrop the worm eggs.\nHogs badly infested with\nworms should be given 4 grains\ncalomel, G grains santonin for\neach 100 pound hog; or 2 12\ngrains santonin, 1 drachma ar\neca nut, 2 grains calomel, 2\ndrachmas sodium bicarbonate\nfor each 100 pound shoat.\nThese remedies should be fed\nin a thin slop. The slop should\nbe made out of ship-stuff or\nbran.\nThe hogs should be dieted for\nat least 21 hours, then given the\nslop containing the proper\namount of medicine. Make sure\nthat there is plenty of trough\nroom so all hogs can get to the\ntrough without crowding, so\neach hog will get his share of the\nslop. If necessary repeat in ten\ndays or two weeks.\nA good remedy used at the\nMissouri Agricultural Experi\nment Station for preventing\nworms is: 3 pounds glaubers\nsalts, 3 pounds common salt, 4\npounds charcoal, 1 pound sul\nphur, 3 pounds copperas and 3\npounds sodium bicarbonate.\nMix and keep in a self-feeder or\ntrough in a dry place where the\nhogs can have access to it at all\ntimes.\nHogs that are practically free\nfrom worms are much hardier\nthan hogs that are badly infest\ned with worms. Being hardier\nthey are more resistant to other\ndiseases common to the hog. So\nhogs should be kept free from\nworms if they are to be the\nmost profitable.\nChildren Cry\nFOR FLETCHER\'S\nCASTOR I A.\nL. S.

It is con\nfirmed testimony that no Lex\nington resident can doubt.\nMrs. Butler Talbott, 2107\nFranklin Ave., Lexington, says:\n"Congestion of my kidneys and\ninflammation of the bladder had\ngiven me intense suffering.\nThere was a retention of the\nkidney secretions and I had a\ndragging backache and pains\nacross my kidneys. I had rheu\nmatic pains too and was unable\nto work. I finally got Doan\'s\nKidney Pills at Crenshaw &\nYoung\'s Drug Store and they\ngave me relief."

Miller, Secretary\nof the Missouri Association for\nthe Relief and Control of Tuber\nculosis at the State Teachers\'\nAssociation meeting at St. Louis\nlast week, made the statement\nthat the schools and the editors\nof Missouri were showing the\nworld the way to eradicate\ntuberculosis. They are making\nMissouri the "show you" state,\nhe said.\nIn 1915 there were 465 fewer\ndeaths from tuberculosis in the\nState than in 1911. This is a\ndiminution in the death rate\nfrom tuberculosis in Missouri\nof two and a half per cent a\nyear. The saving to the state\nin 1915 in dollars and cents was\nnearly four million dollars and\nin the four years, over nine mil-\nions. Dr. Miller attributes this\nsaving of lives and wealth to\nthe spreading of the State in\nconnection with the annual sale\nof Red Cross Christmas seals.\nThe growth of interest in the\nfight in the state, he said, isTTre\nmendous. In the per capita pop\nulation sale of seals in 1914 Mis\nsouri ranked twentieth in the\nroll of states, in 1915 she took\nthe rank of ten, in 1916, he said,\nshe will give Rhode Island, Con\nnecticut and New York State,\nthe leaders in 1915, a hard run\nfor first honor.\nThe Red Cross seals and print\ned matter have been sent to\nSupt. B. M. Little, County Supt.\nII. T. Phillips has been advised\nthat plenty of seals and printed\nmatter can be had for the run.\nschools in Lafayette County.\nThe seal this year comes in\ngreen and red and is very orna\nmental and full of Christmas\ncheer.- The printed matter to\nbe supplied to school children\nand for their distribution, is\nmore attractive than ever. Seals\nwill be sold by mail as well as\nby children, but the schools will\nbe given full credit for the sale\nby mail. People buying seals by\nmail will notify the teachers or\nsuperintendent by a coupon, to\nbe sent by a school child or bv\nmail.\n.

At\ntempts have been made to prepare u\nvaccine for the mice from a product\ncontaining the dea l bacilli, but failure\nhas been the result.

Investigation\nhas shown that wage-earners\nhave a death rate which is twice\nthat of professional men; that\nthere is a high rate of sickness,\nand a great need among wage\nearners for better medical ware.\nThe fear of expense keeps many\nwage-earners from consulting a\nphysician, while many more\nconsult physicians too late and\nleave his care before they are\nentirely cured. In Rochester, N.\nY., a health survey showed that\n39! of those sick in the city\nwere not under the cjre of a\nphysician. In Boston, Mass., it\nis estimated that one-fourth of\nthe people are unable to pay the\nfees of private physicians. Com\npulsory health insurance would\nimprove these conditions.\nIt has been shown that the\naverage loss of time for each\nwage-earner is nine days a year,\nwhich means an aggregate wage\nloss of approximately $500,000,\n000. Health insurance would\nprovide a systematic method of\nmeeting the loss incident to\nsickness. Workers would con\nsult physicians promptly, and\nstay .under their care as long as\nwas necessary, since the loss of\nwages would be provided against\nand the needs of the dependent\nfamily taken care of.\nThe cost of health insurance\nis to be divided between the em\nployees, the employer and the\nstate. The systems carried out\nin uie outer countries or Europe\nhave been thoroughly studied by\na commission in this country,\nand a well defined plan has been\ndrafted.

In some qunrtcrs\nthe Idea prevails that a gas well lasts\nforever and that It Is not necessary to\ncurry much uncpernted territory; but\nIt Is far from the truth. The average\nlife of an Ohio gas well Is four years\nand six months, which has been prov\ned by taking the records of almost 2,-\n000 wells and ascertaining how many\nhave been abandoned. Somo wells\nonly last a year ; others 11 or 12 years ;\ntut the average of tho entire number\nis as noted above.\n- -H\n(pfl liif\nIfM Hp\ni? mm\nmm\nThree years later Lester found him\nself many times a millionaire.

Ills\nparents, overcome by tho blow, re\nceived his wlfo only grudgingly into\ntheir home, and when Rae was there\nshe saw unmistakably how they and\ntheir other guests regarded her.

Ewes in\ngood condition need not be fed\ngrain until about a month be\nfore lambing, when they should\ngradually be accustomed to\ngrain. Ewes in thin or poor\ncondition should receive from\none-fourtk. to one-half a pound\nof grain a day. Straight corn is\nnot the best grain ration. The\ngrain feed should contain some\nof the blood and muscle building\nmaterial. A ration of 6 parts\ncorn ; 3 parts wheat bran ; 1 part\nlinseed oil cake; by weight, has\nbeen proved very satisfactory\nat the Missouri Agricultural Ex\nperiment Station. A ration of\nequal parts by weight of corn,\noats and bran is good.\nThe sheep should receive as\nmuch clover or alfalfa hay as\nthey will eat. The amount of\nhay eaten can be cut down by\nuse of corn silage or corn stover.\nTwo pounds of clean, sweet\ncorn silage can be used to re\nplace about one pound of hay.\nWell-cured corn stover is also\nrelished by the ewes. Ordinarily\nthere is little danger of the\nsheep eating too much of it if\nhay is fed once a day. The\ngreatest danger of corn stover\ncomes from making it the ex\nclusive feed. Under this condi\ntion, compaction with other at\ntendant troubles will often re\nsult.\nA complete report of the in\nvestigations with breeding ewes\nmade by the Missouri Agricul\ntural Experiment Station is in\nBulletin 120 which is free for the\nasking.\nClean salt and water should\nbe kept before the flock always,\nand the sheep should always\nhaw a dry, well-bedded floor to\nlie on.\nThe sheep should all be able\nto eat at the same time without\ncrowding.\nUniversity Women Favor Equal\nSuffrage Cause.\nOf the 800 women registered\nin the University of Missouri.\n522 have signed for a suffrage\ncatalog of the school.

WILL LEAD\nIN THE AIR BY 1919\nAero Club\'s Head Commends\nAction of Congress in Sup\nplying Funds.\nFrom the New York Times.\nAmerica first in aeronautics\nwithin thenext two years! This\nis the prediction contained in a\nstatement issued Saturday by\nAlan R. Ilawiey, president of the\nAero Club of America, and a\nsupplementary statement by\nHenry Woodhouse of the board\nof governors.\nConsidering the great interest\nthat is being taken by the gen\neral public and the many possi\nbilities for the employment of\naeroplanes for general pur\nposes," says Mr. Ilawiey, "I\ndare say that it is possible we\nwill make 5,000 aviators within\nthe coming two years." There\nare 19,000,000 men of military\nage in this country, and there is\nevidence that a large percentage\nof these will learn to fly as soon\nas they get the opportunity.\n"The post office is ready to es\ntablish aeroplane mail carrying\nservice in two hundred localities.\nThe great interest taken in aero\nnautics by men of means during\nthe last year leads us to believe\nthat there will socn be thous\nands of men using aeroplanes,\nnot only for convenience and\nfaster transportation, but also\nto create a reserve of aeroplanes\nwhich will be available for na\ntional defence.\' \'\nMr. Hawley combats a popular\nimpression that this country is\nlacking in motors of as large\nhorse-power and aeroplanes as\nrapid as those in use- in Europe.\n"Congress has already shown\nits interest in aeronautics," he\ncontinues. "Substantial devel\nopments have taken place since\nVilla S raid on Columbus brought\nout the fact that we had only\neight aeroplanes available to\nmeet an emergency. The pub\nlic demanded action and Con\ngress allowed close to $18,000,\n000 for aeronautics for our land\nand water defences. \' This sum\npermits the training of between\n500 and 1,000 aviators for the\narmy, new militia and ariel re\nserve corps. \'\n"There is evidence of substan\ntial progress in building up the\naeronautic branch of the armv\nand the navy. The orders placed\nand being placed for aeroplanes,\nmotors and \' aeronautic equip\nment will do much toward up\nbuilding the aeronautic industry,\nnot only creating a. substantial\nsource of supply of equipment\nfor national defence, but also\naffording encouragement to the\nindustry which will lead to im\nportant developments in aero\nplanes and aeronantic motors."\nMr. Ilawiey commends the\nwork of Aerial Coast Tatrol Unit\nNo. 1, organized by F. Trubee\nDavison, Robert A. LoVett. II P\nDavison, Jr., and nine other men\nat Yale, and the fine showing of\ntwenty-six Harvard men rhirintr\nlast season. He continues:\n"There are approximately\n1,000 universities and colleges\nin this country, with a total of\nabout 1,200,000 students. The\nAreo Club of America has of\nfered medals of merit to be\nawarded,.io the three students\nin each of the hundred largest\nuniversities and military schools\nwho write the best essays on\naeronautics."\nReferring to the problem of\ngetting dirigibles for the army\nand navy, Mr. Hawley said:\n"Among the concerns disposed\nto be pioneers in building (jr\nigiblea are large shipbuilders,\nwho are used to speedy produc\ntion and have most of the fac\ntors needed to make a success nf\nairship building. This country\nneeds tangibles for national de\nfense and for ultarian numo.\nand I believe the American pub\nlic win approve the action of the\narmy and navy in niacin? ordr\nfor four large dirigibles with dif\nferent concerns, to force ibis\nvclopment without io:-..? of time.\nT\nIts F ivi\nI V!\nH w\n1\nha\nn r: in\nr. i . ii i v x l T"\na ii , r.\nThe Riviera of America\nPass Cnristian, Biloxl, Ocean Springs, buliport,\nMississippi Cihj, Baij St. Louis, Pascaoula, Pen\nsacola, New Orleans, Mobile.\nPGolf, Boating, Fishing, Shooting,\naivl all Outdoor Sports\nMAGNIFICENT SHELL ROADS\nThe mild cjuaLle clii\'iafo and pichirescrue surroundings\nera especial! ij attractive to northern people seeking\nV complete clianrte and diversion.
