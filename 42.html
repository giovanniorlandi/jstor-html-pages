The Matanuskas and J, the Kenai Indians are all in attendance, j, and, with the Susitnas and the Kniks,, make a goodly sized crowd. The win, ter\'s catch of fur is all in, and the fun j, is fa9t and furious. The big feast is on !, and moose, fish, bear and porcupine are, being consumed in great quantities^So, far there has been no whisky in the, potlatch, and as long as the marshal\'s, force can keep this out there will prob-., ably be no trouble.

Alaskau., The bill establishing reciprocal rela, tions between the United States and, Canada passed the U. S. seuate Mon, day by a vote of fifty-three to tweuty- \', seven, and will receive the approval of, President Taft today. Wilfred Laurier,, premier of Canada, has assured Presi, dent Taft that the Dominion parlia, ment, will ratify the bill., At Washington, grave charges against, the admiuistratiou have been made. It, is charged that the order issued in Oc- ,, tober of 1910, eliminating a large area, of the Chugach national forest reserve, j, a part of which was given to Dick, Ryan, was irregular. It is charged, that the preliminaries of the transac, tion were kept under cover., Rich pay dirt has beeu found on, Squirrel river, a tributary of the Ko, buk. One thaw at the bottom of a, shaft yielded $650. The gold is coarse, and the ground promises rich returns., A stampede is on from Nome and other, points on Seward peninsula to the new, diggings. Old prospectors have been :, predicting a good find on Squirrel for, several years., Daniel, head of all the Guggenheims, j, recently gave forth the statement that, Alaska is capable of producing from j, $230,000,000 to ?250,000,000 yearly. He j, did not say what special products of, the territory might produce this extra- ?, ordinary amount, but when his lines, of interest are considered, it is reason, able to suppose he meant gold, copper,, coal and flsh., This talk of annexing Alaska to Can, ada is all bally rot, says the Iditarod j, Nuggett, the offspring of some pea eyed,, hare-brained pithecanthropos, or a, sensationmonger. Alaska Is quite able, to work out her own destiny, if given, the opportunity. And if the opportun, ity be denied her until the patience of, her long-sulfering citizeuship is com, pletely exhausted, we can set up a re, public of our own, if you please. But, not Canadian annexation. We don\'t, want to be tacked on to any country, that has a vice-regal court and the ever, visible appendage of archaic royalty., We don\'t want to be exploited by, others. We want to be the arohiteots of, our own destiny. We will be our own, protagonists. And if, by the continued, and flagrant refusal of the government, of the United States to aooord us simple, jnstioe, we are given to understand that, we are undesirable as a territory, and, unthinkable as a future state of the, union, then, an\' it please you, the "Re, public of Alaska" ? the North Star Re, public," if you will, has a melliflous, and resonant sound., Samuel Benn, Wappenstein\'s million, aire father in-law, of Aberdeeu, is be, lieved to be in Alaska safe from pro, cess nerveis of the pr?nd jury for the?, present. A man by the name of Ben is, known to have sailed for Sitka, Alaska^, on July 5. On the 8th, just three days, later, it i9 announced that Mrs. E. B., Benn, daughter-in-law of Samuel Benn,, also sailed for Alaska. ? P.-I., The windswept aud sboal waters of, Controller bay, Alaska, were given up, some tima ago as a possible harbor by, the Guggenheim interests, says George*, W. Evans, a geologist and engineer who, has made five inspections of the coal, fields north of Controller bay, and ia, thoroughly familiar with the operationa, of the vrrious interests in theirendeav, ors to get in that country., The proposed railroad from Hainea, Alaska, up the Porcupine, through the, Kluaue and ou to the Tanana by way, of the head of the White river will open, up what is unquestionably the greatest,, richest aud longest mineral belt on the, American continent and probably the, grestest wealth along the line i> that, which will be found in Yukon territory,., We refer to the rich placer ground iu, the Kluane, where for years good wages, have been made by the most primitive, system of miuiug known. But ouca, the country is peuetrated by a railroad,, eliminating\'the gigautic cost of trans, portation, dredgesaud hydraulic plants, will be installed and tons of gold will, be taken from that district, where but, ounces are taken at present. ? White*, horse Star., Declaring that their business and tha, interests of the city have been injured, by alleged mi-etatements made in aa, editorial in the June issue of Hamp*., ton\'s Magazine, under the title, "An, Opportunity for Congressional luvesti*, gation," the business men and the com*, mercial organizations of Cordova hara, combined efforts and obtained legal ad*, vice on what course of action to pur*, sue. The statement to which the Cor*, dovans object says that the Copper, River & Northwestern railroad has, abandoned Cordova harbor and moved, to Controller bay upon land recently, opened by President Taft. The citi*, zens assert that this statement is in*, correct, and thaL it has resulted in, turning investors and home-builder*, from Cordova aud is injuring the bus*, iness of the city., A careful investigation of the eatU, mates made by the managers of tha, banking institutions of Fairbauks indi, cates that the placer outputs of the dis*, tricts tributary to Fairbanks will reach, a total of 65,000,000 for the year 1911,, This is a conservative estimate. Unex*, pectedly rich pay and acceleration of, the quartz output may bring tha, amount up to $6,000,000, thereby equal, ing last year\'s output. Up to June 1,, the time by which moat of the winter, dumps have usually been cleaned up,, the receipts by the banks approximated, $1,000,000. There has been no lack o (, water and the labor supply for the pur?, pose was satisfactory. Indications are, that the water supply will continue to, suffice, but the supply of labor, amy b$, affected by the reports of new strikes,, I which may cause stampede*.]', '[The Douglas Island News., ilo tared at Douarlaa Post- office as Second, Cl\'.tss Mall Matter., THRMS:-la Advann., ?jie Tear - - $9;00, ?Kx Months ------- 1.50, Three Mont h? ------ 75, Si usrle Copies ------ 10, PUBLISHED EVERY WEDNESDAY, CHARLES A.

Those who wish ta defy, the law, and have uo regard for the, safety of ft heir own property or that of, their neighbors will fail to do so* Of, the latter class we hope there will be, none. If there are, the people will draw, their own conclusions. There will be, trouble, for the city council is deter, mined that the town shall have this, safeguard and that there shall be no, 9xceptions., Another Milestone, Yesterday was John Feusi\'s birthday., John usually celebrates his birthday in, royal aud ancient style, but for a time, it looked as though thisone would pass, without special demonstration.

Goebel,. national lecturer, of the socialist party of America, spoke, to a large audience at Xatatorium hall, last Friday night. He is a rapid and, earnest speaker, and held the attention, of his audience for nearly three hours., There was nothing rabid about his ut, terances, aud while he drew a rather, magnified picture of present evils,, he, made everybody feel happy by promis, ing such great things "under social, iam." He told the people of Douglas, that municipal ownership of docks and, control of the- coal business was the, proper caper and should have the ap, proval and support of all*socialists.

With Ed Jorgenson,, Hearn has been miuing on, and 14, below discovery of Tenderfoot, creek, on the upper Tanana. Finishing, the cleanup he started to town with, the dust, but yesterday while drifting, down the Tanana river, the swift waters, of the stream, at a point about fourteen, milea above town, capsized his boat,, the boat going to the bottom. Hearn, came on iuto Fairbanks, where be had, a drag manufactured at a local black, smith shop and last night, in company, with some friend?, went up river to, grapple for the lost gold. Fortunately, the water was relatively shallow where, the poke went down and the party re, turned this morning tired but triumph, ant., Probably the first coal to be mined, in the much disputed Alaskan areas, will be taken out by the government., The latest project is to establish a, naval eoal reserve. From this, fuel, will be produced for naval operations, in the Pacific ocean. Although this, will bo a step forward, it will not re, lieve the situation with regard to tbe, people of Alaska who need coal, as well, ae those of tbe Pacific states. As su, indication of what may be expected if, the northern fields are opened, tbe, Copper River & Northwestern railway, ha9 already declaied that it will build, one hundred miles additional trackage, as soon as the government says "go, ahead."
