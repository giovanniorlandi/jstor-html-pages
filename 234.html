MEC servers provide personalization services to mobile users for better QoE qualities, but the ongoing migrated data from\nthe source edge server to the destination edge server cause users to have privacy concerns and unwillingness of self-disclosure,\nwhich further leads to a sparsity problem. As a result, personalization services ignore valuable user profiles across edges where users\nhave accounts in and tend to predict users’ potential purchases with insufficient sources, thereby limiting further improvement of\nQoE through personalization of the contents. This paper proposes a novel model, called CEPTM, which (1) collects mobile user\ndata across multiple MEC edge servers, (2) improves the users’ experience in personalization services by loading collected diverse\ndata, and (3) lowers their privacy concern with the improved personalization. This model also reveals that famous topics in one\nedge server can migrate into several other edge servers with users’ favorite content tags and that the diverse types of items could\nincrease the possibility of users accepting the personalization service. In the experiment section, we use exploratory factor analysis\nto mathematically evaluate the correlations among those factors that influence users’ information disclosure in the MEC network,\nand the results indicate that CEPTM (1) achieves a high rate of personalization acceptance due to the availability of more data\nas input and highly diverse personalization as output and (2) gains the users’ trust because it collects user data while respecting\nindividual privacy concerns and providing better personalization. It outperforms a traditional personalization service that runs\non a single-edge server. This paper provides new insights into MEC diverse personalization services and privacy problems, and\nresearchers and personalization providers can apply this model to merge popular users’ like trends throughout the MEC edge\nservers and generate better data management strategies.\n1. Introduction\nWith the proliferation of the Internet of things and the\nburgeoning of the cloud computing paradigm network,\nmobile edge computing (MEC) has been widely adopted at a\ntremendous speed. A large collection of computing resources,\nsuch as mobile devices, application servers, and storage units,\nare utilized to serve users in all types of tenant models. The\npresentation and wide application of MEC have changed\npeople’s daily work and are utilized in the data centers of\ncomputing companies. A recent report has demonstrated that\nextensible infrastructure and processing engine technology\nhave greatly impacted the methods of running applications\nand websites across multiple edge servers [1]. A large number\nof data centers are built by venders to serve a very large number\nof users, and these large-scale, commodity-computer data\ncenters have sufficient resources to provide personalization to\na large number of users. As the de facto centralized big data\nplatform, the cloud computing paradigm supports QoE with\na fruitful number of benefits—convenience, pay for each use,\nand ubiquity—which has given birth to a worldwide range of\nindustry companies [2]. The widely applied denominator in\nMEC is the deployment of cloud computing-like capabilities\nat the edge of the IoT network. Figure 1 demonstrates the\nHindawi\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nVolume 2018, Article ID 8056195, 12 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8056195\n', '2 Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nEdge Data Center\nCloud\nServers\nUser Data\nPersonalization\nTablet\nDesktopsWearable Devices\nVehicle Monitors\nPrivacy Collection\nSmart Phones\nMEC Edges\nFigure 1: The structure of mobile edge computing in the cloud\nenvironment.\nstructure of the personalization service provided by MEC.\nEdge data centers, which are owned and deployed by infrastructure\nproviders, implement a multitenant virtualization\ninfrastructure. Edge devices automatically cooperate with\none another for service collaboration in the cloud environment,\nand personalization activity in edge servers collects\nusers’ data and enhances end users’ experiences by matching\nthe items and their potential buys. These services have\nforged into various support mechanisms and management\nplatforms, creating an open ecosystem where a multitude of\ncustomers can be served.\nDespite the achievements,MEC is still far from a panacea.\nThe massive growth of MEC edge servers [3], including\nwebsites and applications, has led to an explosive volume of\ndata and has caused the problem of “information overload”\n[4]. An unprecedented number of information resources\nare available, but users are often unsure of what to do [4,\n5]. Personalization services can apply information-filtering\nmethods to eliminate the items that users would not click on\naccording to their browsing histories and preferences [6, 7].\nHowever, a prerequisite for a personalization service is that it\nmust collect significant amounts of personal data for precise\nrecommendations [8]. This approach introduces three main\nissues into the research field. First, although a tremendous\nvolume of data is available on the Internet, the valuable data\nthat are useful for analysis constitutes only a small percentage,\nwhich is called “data sparsity” [9]. Second, the collection of\nlarge amounts of data is in conflict with today’s users’ high\nlevel of privacy concern [10]. In addition, users often have\ndifficulty in deciding on information disclosure and do not\npossess sufficient knowledge to evaluate the risks and benefits\n[11]. As a result, users usually denymost information requests.\nThis action leads to a “worse-to-worse” loop, as users do\nnot trust the personalization service and do not share much\nprivate information as input for the information-filtering\nalgorithm.The personalization service cannot generate good\npersonalization using such a small amount of data, and the\nusers will, in turn, trust the personalization service even\nless. Third, users’ standards for accepting personalization are\nnot low, and the users may no longer accept personalization\nin one type of item on an MEC edge server. Instead, users\nfall prey to various types of “innovative” personalization\n[12]. This user-tailored personalization approach is difficult\nto measure, and the trigger that leads a user to accept\npersonalization is unknown. These problems have limited\nthe further development of personalization services in MEC\nnetworks, but the available data fromusers’ multiple accounts\non variousMEC edge servers have provided a solution from a\nnew perspective.The related papers had made some progress\non personalization but lack consideration on privacy issues,\nwhich indicate the motivation of our work.\nThis paper establishes a cross-edgemodel, calledCEPTM,\nwhich integrates valuable resources for analyzing users’\n“like” behaviors from multiple MEC edge servers for diverse\npersonalization and for merging real-time popular buys\nfrom a source edge server into all destination edge servers.\nThis model is equipped with a personalization engine for\nproducing user-tailored suggestions of what items to view.\nCEPTM is applied in the experiment section and achieves\nhigher prediction accuracy than a baseline personalization\nservice that is running on a single-edge server. This finding\nis attributed to it determining the factors that influence\nusers’ decisions on accepting personalization. Our study also\nfocuses on reconciling the tension between user acceptance\nof a personalization and various other factors, e.g., personalization\ndiversity and personalization quality, by using\nexploratory factor analysis (EFA), which is a common modeling\nmethod for explaining the correlations among the\nvariables in terms of fundamental factors. From both the\nuser and managerial perspectives, the results of the model on\nreal-life datasets from the MEC edge servers enabled us to\nanswer the following question: what should personalization\nproviders do to cause mobile users to be more likely to\naccept the personalization and more willing to disclose their\nprivacy? Our suggestions are as follows:\n(1) Collect as many user profiles as possible. Taking this\naction gives the personalization provider access to more\navailable information for generating high-accuracy personalization,\nwhich could further optimize user QoE and increase\nuser satisfaction with the personalization service.\n(2) The scope of personalization should be diverse and,\nespecially, not restricted to the types of products with which\nusers are very familiar, as this could generate repeated items.\nRepeated items are those that users have already liked,\nand showing them will cause users to lose interest in the\npersonalization service and MEC edge server. Compared\nwith a traditional personalization service method, our model\nuses common tags from various types of items by similarity\ncomputing.\n', 'Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 3\n(3) Respect users’ privacy concerns. An effective usertailored\npersonalization approach should not only produce\na personalization that the user will like according to his\nor her preferences but also collect the user’s privacy in a\nvolume that will not raise his or her privacy concerns. It is\nnoted that a user’s tolerance of information disclosure differs\nfrom person to person. Once users feel that their privacy\nhas been compromised by data collection, their trust in the\npersonalization service will decrease.Thus, they will decrease\ntheir amount of disclosure. However, we observed that most\nMECmanagers still seek an agreement with a data collection\npolicy from whoever signs into their edge servers.\n2. Related Work\nThis study builds on existing research on personalization\nservices and privacy in MEC networks and addresses several\ntheoretical and practical gaps in prior studies.Here, we briefly\nintroduce some related work and describe the manner in\nwhich the problems of personalization service and privacy\nwere solved. Gaps were identified in these studies, which we\nsubsequently discuss in this work.\n2.1. Personalization Service versus Privacy Concern. MEC\naims to offer computing resources and information technology\nservices at the network edge, where mobile users face a\nbewildering array of options in an MEC edge server, such\nas which movie to watch [13], which news to read [14], and\nwhich people to add as friends [15]. Personalization services\nhave been applied to help users find the items that best fit\ntheir interests by learning the past item-user relationships\nand performing information-filtering methods. Common\nmethods of personalization services are collaborative filtering\nmethods [16], content-based methods [17], and hybrid\nmethods [18]. Collaborative filtering methods plot the useritem\nrelationship as a metric and use similarity computing,\nsuch as Pearson correlations, to filter the items that have\nlarge gaps with users’ preferences in the distance function.\nContent-based methods integrate the information that best\ndescribes the items, such as manually tagged annotations\nfrom experts and other users, and rank the items according to\nhow well they match the users’ preferences. A hybrid method\nis a mixture of the previous two categories.\nHowever, there remain unsolved problems in this body\nof work. All of the methods necessitate the availability of\nusers’ rudimentary data in such away that the personalization\ncan know the users’ needs at a basic level. One general rule\nis that the quality of the personalization improves with the\navailable volume of personal data [19], but users usually do\nnot agree to this method of data collection [20], which could\nlead to unwanted exposure of information. Conversely, users\ncould disclose their long-termprivacy for temporary benefits,\nsuch as filling in questionnaires in exchange for coupons\nand discounts [21]. This issue is called the “personalizationprivacy\nparadox” [22], and it has attracted the interest of\nseveral researchers. Some researchers have made progress by\nextending this paradox, and they believe that the amount of\nprivacy that is disclosed to personalization services depends\non how much users trust the system. Meyffret argued that\nuser anonymity allows users to feel less concerned about their\nprivacy [23]. Letting users decide what privacy information\nto share with the personalization service is an option [24],\nbut users often rely on default settings when considering their\nprivacy controls [25]. Most users lack sufficient knowledge\nwith regard to personalization services and privacy and are\nnot certain about privacy control [26]. As a result, recent\nstudies have proposed the idea of “usable privacy” [27], which\nstates that users shall be assisted with decision support for\ninformation disclosure. This topic aims at kindly informing\nusers that a propermethod of data collection would not harm\ntheir personal information. Personalization providers should\nmake use of personal data and convince users that good data\ncollection generates more benefits than potential risks.\n2.2. Single-Edge versus Cross-Edge. Personalization service\ntechniques aim at predicting missing ratings for an item\nbased on previous ratings, which are collected from useritem\nconnections. However, the sparsity problem in single-\nedge personalization services has become a major bottleneck\nfor prediction algorithms. There are various reasons for this\nproblem. For example, users’ privacy concerns may cause\nanxiety, thereby limiting the amount of shared information;\neach user may only view a small number of items, which\nyields limited useful data for similarity computing in personalization\nservices; and data for new users are very limited,\nwhich leaves the personalization service with a “cold start”\nproblem [28]. To alleviate data sparsity, one solution is to\nintegrate the data and knowledge using cross-edge rather\nthan single-edge solutions. The joint method has several\nadvantages. First, there is no need to learn new users’ behaviors\nand rules from the very beginning. Although globaliza-\ntion could lead to communication and coordination delays,\nempirical studies have suggested that the representation of\nuser-item relationships can be efficiently accomplished [29].\nSecond, cloud computing make it feasible to provide crossedge\npersonalization services, thereby increasing the number\nof sites that allow users to sign into multiple accounts. A\njoint approach that combines user data from various sites\nwill become a major trend in personalization services and\nMEC. Providing heterogeneous cross-edge personalization\ncould shed light on brand new and promising models, which\ncould tremendously increase the interaction between users\nand items using both single-edge and cross-edge methods.\nUsers’ interests in items could also be discovered in a wider\nscope, thereby leading to diverse personalization from which\nusers can choose [30]. As a result, the likelihood that users\nwould accept the personalization would increase. Finally,\nusers’ privacy concerns could be alleviated. Data collection\nconflicts with users’ high level of privacy protection, so they\nmay share very little information with each edge server.\nCross-edge methods could integrate users’ privacy to better\npredict their potential buys [31]. By establishing relatedness\nacross multiple rating matrices, Li constructed a user-item\njoint mixture model and the corresponding ratings and\nshowed that their proposed algorithm for effective crossdomain\ncollaborative filtering personalization service can\noutperform individual models that are trained on a single\ndomain [32]. Pan observed that, in different domains, the\n', '4 Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nuser feedback could be heterogeneous, such as ratings versus\nclicks. To determine a solution using this feedback, both\nuser and item knowledge from auxiliary data sources are\nintegrated through a principled matrix-based transfer learning\nframework, and the discovered principle can be used\nto coordinate both users and items in the auxiliary data\nmatrices and transfer them to the target domain to reduce\nthe effect of data sparsity [33]. The sparsity problem can\nbe addressed by jointly considering multiple heterogeneous\nlink prediction tasks, such as the links between users and\ndifferent types of items, including books, movies, and songs,\nand the learned intertask similarity was applied to correct\nthe biases and skewness of the distribution from the single\ndomain.\nIn summary, the current shortcomings of single-edge\nmethods and single-domain algorithms have limited the further\ndevelopment of personalization services in MEC due to\nlimited data integration, and new problems are encountered\nwhen incorporating a cross-edge personalization service.The\nfollowing question was posed: Is it possible to migrate useful\nknowledge by establishing bridges between the resource\nedge server and the destination edge servers, to optimize\nthe performance? This question still remains unsolved in\nrecent personalization service studies. Before setting up a\npersonalization service from multiple MEC edge servers, we\nmust determine what mobile users truly want from personalization,\nwhat factors influence the likelihood that they\nwill accept personalization from a cross-edge personalization\nservice, and what we should do to make them more willing\nto disclose their privacy in the MEC network. This paper\nis aimed at these three targets and designs a cross-edge\nmodel prototype, which is focused on personalization service\nand data management for users from a cross-edge MEC\nenvironment. This model, CEPTM, provides an informing\nfunction of what users’ friends are doing on various MEC\nedge servers and is equipped with a personalization engine\nto produce user-tailored suggestions of what items to view.\nBy integrating the resources of user-item relationships from\nmultiple MEC edge servers, we also discover the factors\nthat affect users’ willingness to accept personalization with\nexploratory factor analysis.\n3. Methods and Materials\n3.1. Model for Cross-Edge MEC. In this paper, we propose a\nprototype of the model, called CEPTM, which consists of the\ninteractions between users and diverse items from multiple\nMEC edge servers, personalization for new items, and privacy\ncollection strategies. CEPTM has two basic functions: (a)\ninforming users about what their friends are doing in all\nMEC servers and (b) generating personalization for items\nby calculating the possibility that one user may like the\npersonalization, while focusing on examining the factors that\naffect users’ decisions on accepting the personalization. The\nprototype of themodel is depicted in Figure 2, where Johnson\nhas friends across different MEC devices; e.g., Mike is his\nfriend on photo and music sites, and Nancy is his friend\non a music and movie sites. Friends share favorite items of\ndiverse types but usually have common tags, such as fiction\nand entertainment, which make personalization of various\ntypes of items feasible.\n3.1.1. Basic Data Structure. The data structures of users and\nitems that are loaded to the model are as follows.\nUser (Id, Profile, Friends [𝑖𝑑1, 𝑖𝑑2, . . ., 𝑖𝑑𝑥], ViewHistory,\nServers [𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . ., 𝑠𝑦]): a user may have multiple names on\ndifferentMEC servers towhich (s)he has registered.However,\nthe model should use only one Id to identify a user. This\ndata structure also includes private user information, e.g., age,\ngender, phone number, postage code, and affiliation, which\ncan be collected from all of the servers under the users’\npermissions and should be stored in the user Profile. A user\ncan add other users as his/her friends in the list of Friends,\nwhile ViewHistory records users’ browsing histories for all\ntypes of items in the following format:\nItem (Id, Category, Tags [𝑡1, 𝑡2, . . . , 𝑡𝑖], Weight, Servers\n[𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . . , 𝑠𝑦]): an item must be named with an Id that is\nnot equal to any existing items, while Category records the\ngroups to which this item belongs, e.g., books, flowers, and\nstories. When an item is uploaded by a user to a Server for\nthe first time, the user can add descriptions about this item\nwith several Tags, e.g., romantic, comedy, and tragedy. Users\ncan rate an item with a five-scale range, and the average rate\ncan be calculated as Weight.\n3.1.2. Personalization Engine. CEPTM is equipped with a\npersonalization algorithm that calculates the recommended\nitems in three steps. First, the algorithm determines the\nfriends and computes their similarities. Specifically, the similarities\namong friends are given by the common “ratings”,\nas defined by Pearson’s correlation coefficient [34–36], which\ncould indicate the linear correlation between two variables:\n𝑆𝑓𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑠 =\n𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑥,𝑦\n√𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡2𝑥 ×𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡2𝑦\n(1)\nwhere 𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑥,𝑦 is the total Weight of the rated items that\nusers x and y have in common, while 𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑥 is the total\nweight of the items that are rated by user x. The Weight\nof each item is initialized to 1. Second, personalization is\ngenerated by assigning Weights to items that are rated by\nfriends:\nWeight = ∑\n𝑓𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑠 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑠\n𝑆𝑓𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑠 (2)\nwhere the Weight of a recommended item is the sum of the\nrates given by friends. All of the recommended items are\npresented to users in decreasing order of Weight. Finally,\nitems that are rated by the users are removed, and an item\nis recommended in the first priority that has common Tag(s)\nwith the removed items.\n', 'Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 5\nfriend list\nfriend list\nJohnson\nwatched\nJohnson’s Movies Similar Movies\nmay watch\nmay listen to\nlistened to\nJohnson’s Music\nand Albums\nSimilar Music\nand Albums\nNancy\nMike\nposted\nJohnson’s Photos\nWar of the Planet of the Apes\nStar Wars: Episode VIII\nGuardians of the Galaxy\nSpider-Man: Homecoming\nBlade Runner 2048\nAlien Covenant\nMasque\nAlien Dress\nCommon Tag: fiction\nposted\nMike’s Photos\nHouse Party\nSwimming Pool\nFight Star\nSome Nights\nWe Are Young\n18 Years\nEverything’s Okay\nCounting Stars\nCommon Tag: entertainment\nFigure 2: Prototype of the cross-edge model CEPTM.\n3.1.3. Informing Function. The informing function can\ninform users about their friends’ activities on all MEC edge\nservers, such as new posts and relevant personalization. The\nfollowing is an example of a message that could be provided\nby CEPTM:\n“Dear Mike (User IdMike), your friend Nancy (User\nIdNancy) has posted ‘Surf all the way to the North with my\npaddle boat!’ on Sina Weibo at 7:21 p.m. on January. 21, 2018.”\nThe message contains the user’s name and Id, his friend’s\nname and Id, the post status and relevant item paddle\nboat, and the name of the Sina Weibo. The hyperlinks are\nalso provided, as users may click them for message details,\ne.g., Mike (User IdMike) will direct the user “Mike” to his\nhomepage, “Surf all the way to the North with my paddle\nboat!” will direct the user to the real poster on his friend\nNancy’s homepage, and Weibo will direct the user to Weibo.\nAs a result, all of themessages that are presented by themodel\nwill contain the following information: the users’ Ids, friends’\nIds, friends’ posts, the item Id, and the Server.\nA nearby stranger could be suggested as an addable friend\nto the users. A usermust disclose relevant private information\nto CEPTM to receive messages from this stranger and may\nadd him/her as a friend later. For example, a user could\nprovide his current location to see a message from a nearby\nstranger, or the model could display an upcoming motor\nshow that will be held at the university at which a user studies\nif the user discloses the campus on which he is studying. A\nconcert tour event could be displayed by CEPTM if the user\nis willing to reveal which style of music he likes the most.\nFurthermore, some information will be grayed out in the\nmessage if the person is not a friend of the user.This approach\nis a privacy protection strategy, but it also encourages users to\nadd more friends. The differences between the formats of the\nmessages from a friend and a stranger can be identified from\nthe following:\nFriend (User name & Id, Friend name & Id, poster &\npersonalization)\nStranger (User name & Id, Stranger Id, poster &\npersonalization)\nwhere the stranger’s hyperlink will direct the clicker to a page\nthat asks whether the user would like to add the stranger\n', '6 Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nas a friend with the poster’s information as the reference.\nThe stranger and the user may have no overlapping MEC\nserver, so the model may suggest that the user register first\nby clicking Server. Before the stranger accepts the user as\na friend, the details of the stranger’s homepage and the\ncomments and likes will not be available to the user. All of the\ndescriptions of recommended items, persons (users, friends,\nand strangers), and posters are available when clicking a\ncorresponding link to the homepage. The user can adjust his\nthreshold for eliminating strangers who have low similarity\nwith him and avoiding recommended items with low scores.\n3.2. Exploratory Factor Analysis. CEPTM can not only provide\npersonalization and informing services but also analyze\nthe latent variables that could affect a user’s willingness to\naccept personalization. Here, we introduce the exploratory\nfactor analysis (EFA) that will be applied in the experiment\nsection. When the latent variables that lead to an observed\nitem (e.g., users could accept personalization) are unknown,\none solution for determining the variables is to apply an\nEFA to primitively identify the number of factors and their\nassociated correlations. An EFA is used to determine the\nminimum volume of factors that explain the correlations\namong the latent variables.The dimensions are reducedwhen\npossible.The factors include common factors, unique factors,\nand errors. There is no correlation among the latent variables\nwhen the common factors are extracted. Factor analysis\nmainly focuses on the common factors. As a result, the error\nis usually combined with a unique factor.\n𝐵𝑚𝑛 = 𝑓𝑛1 × 𝑤𝑛1 + 𝑓𝑛2 × 𝑤𝑛2 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑓𝑛𝑥 × 𝑤𝑛𝑥 + 𝑑𝑛\n× 𝑢𝑚𝑛\n(3)\nwhere 𝐵𝑚𝑛 is the standard deviation of sample𝑚 on observed\nitem 𝑛, 𝑓𝑛𝑥 is a common factor with corresponding Weight\n𝑤𝑛𝑥, and 𝑑𝑛 is the unique factor with corresponding 𝑢𝑚𝑛.\nAn EFA has to cover as many aspects as possible to find\nthe factors that affect the observed item. Our method was to\ninvite EMC mobile users to participate in an online survey,\nwhich required each person to consider “on what condition I\nwill accept the personalization” for as much personalization\nas possible. The natural language processing technique was\napplied to the dataset of their answers to determine which\ncontent was mentioned. The code was written in Python and\nselected nouns as keywords in such a way that we could\nidentify the primary concerns when a personalization was\naccepted. Keywords were ranked based on the number of\ntimes they were mentioned.\n|𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟| = \U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑1\U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128 + \U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑2\U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅\n+ \U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑥\U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128\U000f5128\n(4)\nFor example, the respondents mentioned “satisfaction”\n47 times and “interesting” 83 times, and the technique\ncategorized both of these keywords under “user experience”.\nThen, the score for “user experience” was calculated as 47 +\n83 = 130.The participants alsomentioned “security” 52 times,\n“fraud” 73 times, and “illegal usage” 20 times. Therefore,\nthese three keywords were categorized under “data collection\naspect”, and its score was calculated as 52 + 73 + 20 = 145.\nIf “data collection aspect” was not identified as a factor in\nEFA, then “satisfaction” would not be a factor either.The load\nfactor, namely, Cronbach’s Alpha, should be more than .70\nfor a good fit. The top-ranking (e.g., i1-i6 and j1-j4) keywords\nwould be regarded as the indicators of the factor; see step\n1 in Figure 2. Kaiser’s Rule is applied in EFA to determine\nthe number of factors, where the eigenvalues of each factor\nwere visualized according to its Weight contribution to the\nobserved item. Kaiser’s rule is to drop all of the necessary\ncomponents with eigenvalues that are less than 1.0 or, in\nother words, to consider information that is accounted for\nby an average single item while recommending the use of a\nsole cut-off criterion for estimating the number of factors as\noverextracted factors. The calculation is stopped when the\nconfidence interval for each eigenvalue is greater than 1.0.\nOnce the number of factors has been confirmed, GEOMIN,\nwhich is an oblique rotation method in EFA, is used to\ndetermine the factor structure, which should look similar to\nthe model formation in step 2 and step 3 of Figure 3. For\nexample, in step 2, i3 is not defined as a key indicator of factor\nf 1, j2 is not defined as a key indicator of factor f 2, and i6 is not\ndefined as a key indicator of factor f 3. Once all factors have\nfound their determining indicators, we should know that the\neffects from f 3 on f 2 and f 2 on f 1 are all positive, shown in\nstep 3.\nThe final structure consists of the latent variables, including\nthe top-ranking factors and indicators, combined with\nthe analysis methods, e.g., maximum likelihood parameter\nestimation and GEOMIN rotation.The output should consist\nof Cronbach’s Alpha of each factor with the indicators and the\nmodel fitting information, e.g., values of log likelihood, ChiSquared\nTest with the p value, RMSEA (Root Mean Square\nError of Approximation), andGEOMIN rotated loadings and\ncorrelations.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Prestudies before Setting Up CEPTM. This survey\naddresses the users’ behaviors when managing their\naccounts. We regard users who have accounts in more than\nthree MEC edge servers equal to users who are involved\nin more than three servers with a joint account. The total\nnumber of users who completed our survey was 860, and\n89.77% of them (N = 772) indicated that they have multiple\naccounts in at least three MEC servers. We further asked\nthese users for the reasons that they have so many accounts,\nand their answers cover five aspects: to keep in touch with\nfriends (N = 353, 41.05%), e.g., “My best friend Nancy had\nregistered a new account in another app, and she posts\nmore updates than in the site to which we both registered”;\nto meet new people (N = 246, 28.60%), e.g., “Tim Cook\nmostly releases his posts on Weibo” and “I want to know my\nclassmates better from Weibo”; to be well known (N = 394,\n45.81%), e.g., “I want to find a good internship opportunities”;\nto try something new (N = 95, 11.05%), e.g., “The interface\nof the old website is so hard to use” and “So many ads\nin my old account”; to gain access to available resources\n', 'Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 7\nf1\nf3\nf2\ni2 i3 i4 i5 i6 j1 j2 j3i1 j4\nf1\nf3\nf2\ni2 i3 i4i1 j1 j2 j3 j4\ni2 i3 i5 i6 j3 j4\nf1\nf3\nf2\nj2\nj3\ni1\ni2\ni4\ni2 i3 i5 j3 j4\n+\n++\nFigure 3: Structure formation and factor determination using EFA.\n(N = 503, 58.49%), e.g., “Weibo provides a tremendous\namount of knowledge and news for reference, and I can\nsimply sign in with my Tencent account”; and for other\nreasons (N = 85, 9.88%), e.g., “For fun.” From these aspects,\nthe general reason for having multiple MEC server accounts\nwas summarized as “being connected as much as possible”.\nIn the circumstances of cloud computing, users require\nseveral types of information for supporting daily decisions in\nwork, study, etc. For example, to fix a car, users can browse an\nautocare site for suggestions. Visiting a new campus requires\nusers to visit its college website beforehand. However, the\nusers also gave some feedback on the flaws of having so many\naccounts (N = 612, 71.16%). They mainly stated that they did\nnot have enough time to browse so many sites, e.g., “The site\nthat I often visit is different from the one where my friends\nvisit and post mostly”, “I will not post my updates repeatedly\nin all of my accounts”, and “I post my updates on one site\nonly, and I sometimes miss the updates that my friend post\non the other site.” We conclude that users have difficulty in\nmanaging multiple accounts. Designing the CEPTM that\ncould distribute and post users’ information from all of\ntheir MEC server accounts in a cross-edge manner is truly\nnecessary.\nFrom the managerial perspective, a personalization\nservice would increase its prediction accuracy if it could\ncollect enough user information, especially when the\ncollected information has a common Tag. This rule is\nalso applicable for multiple edge servers. Compared with\ncollecting user data from a single-edge server, collecting\nuser data from cross-edge would increase the likelihood of\nlocating popular topics through MEC networks, thereby\nguaranteeing higher personalization accuracy. For example,\nsuppose that a user had viewed cake on a picture site,\nlistened to romantic and peaceful songs on a music site,\nviewed roses and lilies on a flower app, watched romance and\nfiction films on a movie website, added her family members\nand bridesmaids as friends on Weibo, and read love and\nfriendship tales on a book app. All of the viewed items share\nthe common Tag “romantic”. The personalization engine\ncould generate an ad for wedding services accordingly, and\nthis user would be more likely to accept this suggestion.\nIn contrast, if the personalization engine only collected\nthis user’s actions on the flower and book sites, where\nthe common Tags are “friendship” and “romantic”, the\nprediction could miss the appropriate ad personalization.\nAnother advantage of integrating the users’ data from\ncross-edge is collecting more information while keeping the\nusers’ privacy concerns low. Users are likely to disclose their\ninformation only on a specific MEC site, e.g., a patient may\nonly post his hypertension status on amedical website, rather\nthan sharing this information with his friends on Weibo,\nor a person may only share her monthly income with Wells\nFargo bank for a loan, while choosing not to disclose this\ninformation elsewhere. Table 1 shows that users’ volumes of\ninformation disclosure in response to daily requests depend\non how much they trust the information recipient. Users\nmostly disclose the sensitive privacy to their trusted people\nas expected, e.g., family members. However, the interesting\nthing is that users mostly disclose low sensitivity information\nto the people they work alongside or see only occasionally,\ne.g., friends and companies, regardless of whether the\ninformation was collected from a phone, a computer, or\na car. A good model collects the users’ data across MEC\nedge servers to maximize the available information for\ngenerating precise personalization. All of the items were\ncollected under the users’ permission. Another 137 MEC\nmobile users were invited online to register for accounts,\nincluding WeChat (Photos, http://www.wechat.com/), Kuwo\nMusic (Music and Albums, http://www.kuwo.cn/), Youku\n(Movies, http://www.youku.com/), and Weibo (People,\nhttp://www.weibo.com/). Each user must view the items on\neach site for at least 15 minutes.The goal was to predict which\n', '8 Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nTable 1: Disclosure rates of users privacy with different recipient.\nITEMS\\OPTIONS Family Friend Stranger None\nSensitive Information on portable device 153(52.76%) 115(39.66%) 13(4.48%) 106(36.55%)\nLow-Sensitive Information on portable device 121(41.72%) 133(45.86%) 35(12.07%) 102(35.17%)\nLow-Sensitive Information on computer 77(26.55%) 88(30.34%) 15(5.17%) 156(53.79%)\nSensitive Information on computer 88(30.34%) 62(21.38%) 18(6.21%) 162(55.86%)\nSensitive Information on connected vehicles 165(56.9%) 85(29.31%) 14(4.83%) 88(30.34%)\nLow Sensitive Information on portable device 149(51.38%) 160(55.17%) 51(17.59%) 66(22.76%)\nad generated by the personalization engine users would\nlike to view.

Thus, it could guarantee higher prediction accuracy\nby learning users’ preferences through their browsing\nhistories. Establishing a cross-edge model could provide\nmutual benefits from both the users’ perspective and the\nmanagerial perspective.\n4.2. Participants and Procedure in Main Experiment. We\nrecruited 860 people from Sojump, which is a website that\nprovides online survey services that connect more than 2\nmillion members throughout China and enables individuals\nand businesses to coordinate the use of human intelligence\nto perform tasks that computers are currently unable to\ncomplete. For quality purposes, only adult online users who\nhad signed into at least three of the four sites, e.g., WeChat,\nKuwo, Youku, and Weibo, and spent more than 2 hours per\nday on these websites were allowed to participate in the main\nexperiment. Since there is little difference among which tools\nusers applied in browsing sites in Table 1, users can utilize\nany MEC device through the procedure. At least 1/3 of their\nfriends must have multiple accounts on these websites. Of\nthe MEC mobile users, 561 were male, 329 were between\nthe ages of 18 and 26, 413 were between the ages of 26\nand 45, and 118 were older than 45. Additionally, 278 users\nwere working in or studying computer science or used their\nmobile device and computer very often, e.g., programmers\nand network engineers; 539 participants had received a B.S.\ndegree or less education, 253 had received an M.A. degree,\nand 68 had received a Ph.D. degree or above. Each participant\nwas required to have at least 10 common ratings with his\nfriends, and otherwise it was suggested that he performmore\nratings and attempt to join the study again to avoid the cold\nstart problem.\nThe experiment was conducted for 4 days, and the\nperformance of CEPTM demonstrated that hot topics that\nwere raised on one site could spread to the other 3 sites\nover time in the MEC network. The keywords that had been\nclicked the most were considered to be hot top-10 topics. As\nshown in Figure 4, topics were segmented into 4 styles, e.g.,\nromance, comedy, adventure, and thriller. Each style came\nfrom only one site, e.g., romance in WeChat in Figure 4(a),\ncomedy in KuwoMusic in Figure 4(b), adventure in Youku in\nFigure 4(c), and thriller in Weibo in Figure 4(d). Hot topics\nin the other 3 sections in each site were removed in the first\n24 hours. Users can update their status and forward friends’\nstatuses within the site or across the sites. During the second\n24 hours, the number of clicks on the hot topics in all 4 sites\nstarted rising. On the third day, hot topics started to migrate\nto the other 3 sites. During the last 24 hours, the number of\nclicks remained high in each section of each site and stayed\nequally high as the clicks on the same topics in the other\n3 sites. A baseline personalization service (BLPS) was also\napplied in each site, which only allows forwarding friends’\nstatuses within the site.\nDuring the 4 days, we also compared the number of clicks\nbetween CEPTM running on the four sites (red squares and\nlines) and BLPS running on each site (black squares and\nlines). The BLPS utilizes users’ profiles from a single site and\nrecommends items by similarity computing, and items from\nfriends who share the most common interests in hot topics\nare provided. The results indicate that the clicks increased\nmuch faster in CEPTM than the clicks in each BLPS, and\nthe average number of clicks on personalization provided by\nCEPTM was 87.17% higher than 58.09% provided by BLPS.\nTherefore, CEPTM outperforms BLPS.\n4.3. Results and Discussion. We examine the possible reasons\nbehind the experimental results. First, all qualified users were\nasked about their personal traits, including item expertise:\nhow much they are familiar with the item category, trust\npropensity: how much they trust the BLPS or CEPTM, and\nfamiliarity with online privacy and personalization: how well\nthey understand the privacy collection. Second, they were\nbriefly introduced to the functions of CEPTM and informed\nof how the personalization service works. Afterward, we\nadministered a quiz to ensure that they understood our\nresearch target and had a basic understanding of what we\nwere trying to accomplish. Finally, we requested 30 privacy\nitems that belonged to one type in Table 1 from the users,\nand they could choose to agree to or deny the disclosures.\nThe personalization service produced an item by similarity\ncomputing, and when a user finished the 30th request, we\nasked them 8 questions regarding their experience. These\nquestions involved the users’ understanding of CEPTM, their\nsatisfaction with CEPTM, the quality of the recommended\nitems, privacy concerns, etc. The responses to the 30 requests\nand eight questions on personal traits, privacy collection\n', 'Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 9\nCEPTM\nBLRS\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf C\nlic\nks\n (%\n)\n16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 888\nPassing Hours\n(a)\nCEPTM\nBLRS\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf C\nlic\nks\n (%\n)\n16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 888\nPassing Hours\n(b)\nCEPTM\nBLRS\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf C\nlic\nks\n (%\n)\n16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 888\nPassing Hours\n(c)\nCEPTM\nBLRS\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf C\nlic\nks\n (%\n)\n16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 888\nPassing Hours\n(d)\nFigure 4: Four comparisons between CEPTM and BLRS running on each MEC.\naspects, user experience, and personalization quality were\ninputted into an exploratory factor analysis. Table 2 provides\ndetails on the results.\nTable 2 lists the eight factors in the experiment that\nwere loaded to fit the factor measurement model and the\nstructural relations between the factors and variables in\nthe exploratory factor analysis. The model achieved a good\nfit: p < 0.01, CFI = 0.985, TLI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.035,\nSRMR = 0.631, and it revealed interesting findings among\nthe factors, e.g., item expertise andpersonalization diversity\nhad a positive effect on the users’ understandability (+0.471,\n+0.273), which in turn raised the personalization quality\n(+0.371) and lowered the users’ privacy concerns (-0.239).\nFurthermore, users’ trust propensity had a negative effect\non satisfaction (-0.351), while satisfaction increased the\nacceptance rate of a recommended item or stranger (+0.291).\nUsers’ item expertise and familiarity with privacy and PS\nboth positively affected users’ understanding of the crossedge\nmodel (+0.418, +0.227). According to the above results,\nwe describe why those factors influenced one another and\nbriefly discuss how to manage users’ information disclosure\nand the quality of the personalization engine. We strongly\nargue that users’ knowledge that supported their decisions on\ninformation disclosure played an important role in this study.\nItem expertise and familiarity with privacy and PS determined\nusers’ understandability, which in turn increased the\nprobability of accepting recommended items. This aspect\nfurther lowered users’ privacy concerns in such a way that\nthe users decided to disclose more information, and they\nincreased their satisfaction with the personalization of the\nmodel. Users could benefit from the personalization service\nand the informing function, so they disclosemore privacy for\nincreased personalization quality. In this study, if users should\nknow the underlying strategy of the privacy collection and\n', '10 Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nTable 2: Eight factors in the users’ feedback on personalization services (PS) and the related parameters.\nFactors Questions User Feedback Sample Alpha AVE\nitem expertise 4 I know the artists very well, and my friends always\naccept my music suggestions. 0.83 0.832\ntrusting propensity 4 I seldom accept a personalization from a stranger. 0.73 0.681\nfamiliarity with privacy & PS 3 I understand that the personalized needs people’s\nprivate information to generate better personalization. 0.89 0.893\nunderstandability 3 The model provides better management of friends’\nposts across multiple sites. 0.75 0.709\nsatisfaction 5 The informing function of the model saved me time in\nviewing my friends’ status updates on all sites. 0.90 0.738\nPS quality 4 I like the recommended item. 0.78 0.712\nprivacy concern 5 I don’t like requests that are too sensitive. 0.75 0.709\nPS diversity 3 I like the personalization of a new type of item. 0.81 0.731\npersonalization, they might decrease their privacy concerns\nand increase their propensity for information disclosure.\nUsers chased after the benefits of using our model, such as\nreceiving high-quality personalization for unknown items, as\nwell as being informed of their friends’ real-time activities\non other edge servers in MEC network. This trend was\nreflected in their satisfaction being directly determined by the\npersonalization quality.\nThis study reveals that personalization should collect\nusers’ data while respecting their privacy concerns. This\napproach would allow users to share their information without\nexperiencing worry or unnecessary anxiety. However,\ncurrent privacy policy has not been designed well enough\nto manage and collect the users’ information based on their\npersonal traits or background knowledge. For example, a site\nin the MEC network will post the same set of terms and\ndata policy to whoever signs in, even though most users do\nnot read it. From a managerial perspective, why not design\na personalized data collection policy in such a way that\nthe users’ satisfaction could be maximized? That should be\nan important consideration when adjusting the interactions\nbetween MEC edge servers and their users.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel cross-edge model, called\nCEPTM, for better personalization service, andwe reveal how\nfamous topics in one resource edge server can emerge on\nseveral other destination edge servers inMEC.The prototype\nof themodel consists of the interaction between the users and\ndiverse items, the personalization of new items, and privacy\ncollection and distribution strategies. Our study indicates\nthat CEPTM (1) achieves a high rate of personalization\nacceptance due to the availability of a large amount of data as\ninputs and highly diverse personalization as outputs and (2)\ngains users’ trust because it collects user data while respecting\nan individual’s privacy concerns. It outperforms a baseline\npersonalization service that is running on a single MEC\nedge server. The experiment results, which were performed\non several real-life datasets, indicated that the trends of hot\ntopics on a resource edge server could migrate to other\nedge servers in an MEC environment. An exploratory factor\nanalysis revealed that personalization of diverse types is more\nlikely to be accepted than single-type personalization and\nthat helping users gain more knowledge and understanding\ncan increase their disclosure of personal information, which\nenables the personalization service to predict items better,\nwith higher accuracy. Additionally, CEPTM has provided\nnew insight into handling the cold start problem in cloud\ncomputing, to which scholars and personalized providers\ncan refer. In future work, we will continue to focus on usertailored\npersonalization, which covers both providing items\nthat fit users’ preferences and requesting users’ disclosures\naccording to their individual privacy concerns in MEC\nnetworks. Hopefully, additional interesting results will be\ndiscovered.\nData Availability\nUsers’ data for the study are collected from our previous work\n[37, 38], and users who have at least 3 server accounts in EMC\ncan join the study in Section 5.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (No. 61702312), the Natural\nScience Foundation of Shandong Province of China (No.\nZR2017BF019), and the project of Shandong Province\nHigher Educational Science and Technology Program (No.\nJ17KB178); and Hongchen Wu acknowledges the financial\nsupport from the China Scholarship Council (CSC, File No.\n201306220132).\nReferences\n[1] R.
