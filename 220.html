These hotspot regions are \nareas which have a huge number of highly specialised \nand obligated cave-dwelling species. Discovering \nnew troglobitic species with extreme adaptations to \nunderground environment, engages great activity \namong biospeleologists (for example, Taglianti, \n1996; Edgecombe et al., 2020). Simultaneously, cave \nareas outside the hotspot regions are definitely less \ninteresting to study, for example, some parts of the \nnorth temperate zone. One of the reasons is the lack \nof or very few obligated cave-dwelling species, which is \ndue to the glacial history in the past geological periods \n(Demel, 1918; Kowalski, 1955; Culver & Pipan, 2010). \nNevertheless, the caves in these areas have made \nunique ecosystems with a lot of inhabitants, which are \nworth knowing. Thus, further studies and analyses \nhelp to create the distribution patterns of species in \nthis climate zone. \nPoland is a country in Central Europe, and in spite \nof several cave regions (Fig. 1) hosting a total of 5,200 \ncaves (Gradziński & Kicińska, 2017), there are still \nmany gaps in our knowledge about underground \nfauna, especially invertebrates. Research on \nterrestrial invertebrates in caves of Poland dates \nback to the early 20th century (Kocot-Zalewska & \nDomagała, 2020). Most of the studies have been \nconcerned with whole communities of invertebrates \nin the caves (e.g., Arndt, 1921, 1923; Pax & Maschke, \n1935; Kowalski, 1955; Skalski, 1973, 1981). Few \nresearch has been dedicated to groups like springtails \n(Stach, 1918; Pomorski, 1992), spiders (SanockaWołoszyn,\n1963, 1973, 1981), or mites (Maślak & \nBarczyk, 2011; Barczyk & Madej, 2014). Hitherto, \nno research has been devoted to flies, which are one \nof the common groups that inhabit the caves and, \nundoubtedly, the easiest to observe. However, Schmitz \n(1935) published an article about a new species \nfrom the Phoridae family that was collected from the \nRadochowska Cave, and Klecienko Adit in Sudety \nMts. Flies belong to a community that is known as \nparietal fauna (Košel, 2004; Moseley, 2007) and in \nPolish literature named “wall fauna” (Kowalski, 1955; \nSkalski, 1981), which means it lives on the sides of \npassages and chambers in caves. This community is \nobserved throughout the year, and many species live \nin caves constantly where they create subterranean \npopulations. Although there have been no reports \nin literature on the research dedicated only to flies \nin Polish caves, some information can be found in \nvarious articles such as Arndt (1921), Pax & Maschke \n(1935), Kowalski (1955), Skalski (1967), Hajduk & \n', '204 Kocot-Zalewska and Woźnica\nInternational Journal of Speleology, 50 (2), 203-211. Tampa, FL (USA) May 2021 \nOgorzałek (1970), Sobiepanek (1985), Woźnica (2004), \nDumnicka & Płotek (2013). Summarising those pieces \nof information, over 60 species of flies have been \nidentified so far (Kocot-Zalewska & Domagała, 2020), \nincluding 17 from the Heleomyzidae family (KocotZalewska\n& Woźnica, 2020). Most of these studies \nhad concentrated on a list of species inhabiting caves. \nAreas in which studies about invertebrate \ncavernicolous fauna were performed, are Sudety Mts \n(Arndt, 1921, 1923; Pax & Maschke, 1935; Pax, 1937; \nHajduk & Ogorzałek, 1970), Tatra Mts (Kowalski, \n1955; Skalski, 1967; Sobiepanek 1985), and KrakówCzęstochowa\nUpland (Skalski & Wójcik, 1968; Skalski, \n1973, 1981; Papp & Woźnica, 1993; Woźnica, 2004, \n2006; Woźnica & Klasa, 2009). Unfortunately, in a few \ncave regions in Poland, i.e., Nida Basin, Carpathian, \nand Świętokrzyskie Mountains, no studies have \nbeen carried out (Fig. 1). Heleomyzid flies have \nalso been reported in a variety of caves in other \nEuropean countries. Summary of information about \nheleomyzid flies from European caves is included \nin Appendix 1. \nFig. 1. Map with main cave areas in Poland.\nThe purpose of this article is to characterize heleomyzid \nflies occurring in the caves of Poland with emphasis \non their ecological classification status, number of \nspecies, preference of cave zone, and distribution in \ndifferent cave areas in Poland.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nHistorical data\nAll accessible research papers regarding the \nheleomyzid flies in the caves of Poland were analyzed. \nThese include works published as monographs, \noriginal research papers, notes, and also conference \nmaterials. All bibliography can be found in KocotZalewska\n& Domagała (2020) and Zatwarnicki (2021).\nCurrent study\nStudy area\nThe study has been conducted in six caves in the \nnorthern part of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland \nin Poland (Fig. 2A). The following caves have been \nexplored: W Zielonej Górze, Towarna, Pod Sokolą \nGórą, Kroczycka, Psia, and Zegar (Fig. 2A, Table 1). \nAll studied caves are rather small. In these caves, \nthe entrance zone can be distinguished, which is \na twilight zone with an influence of sunlight (with \nexception of Kroczycka Cave). The climatic conditions \nin this zone are evidently synchronised with climatic \nconditions on the surface. In the middle of the studied \ncaves is dark and climatic conditions are more stable. \nThis part can be classified as a transition zone. Only \nthe last few meters of corridors in these caves can be \nconsidered as a deep zone with rather stable climatic \nconditions, and total darkness (Table 1). More detailed \ninformation about climatic conditions can be found in \nKocot-Zalewska (2017).\nSamples \nThe samples were collected from December 2014 \nthrough February 2017. The heleomyzid flies were \ncaught in barber traps without any bait but filled \nwith 30% propylene glycol as a preservative liquid. A \ndirect searching method was also used, but only for \ncorroboration of the flies’ composition from cave walls \nand barber traps. The traps were always placed in the \nsame areas, i.e., in the entrance zone, in the middle \nof the passages and at the end of the cave (example \nFig. 2B). The specimens were collected from the traps \n', '205Cave-dwelling heleomyzid flies from the Polish caves\nInternational Journal of Speleology, 50 (2), 203-211. Tampa, FL (USA) May 2021\nFig. 2.

The collection method \nwas changed in 2016 when the traps were used for a \nfortnight but were collected every other month. \nThe material was kept in plastic vials using 70% \nethanol. All specimens were identified using various \nkeys, especially those made by Czerny (1924) – mainly \nfor species of the genus Suillia, and those made by \nGorodkov (1970), especially for Heleomyza species. \nThe material is stored in the collection of the Upper \nSilesian Museum in Bytom (pl. Jana III Sobieskiego 2, \n41-902 Bytom, Poland).\nThe picture of the female specimen of Scoliocentra \nconfusa was taken with a Canon 600d digital camera \nattached to Nikon SMZ stereomicroscope, using \ncomputer graphic techniques (Corel Draw X6) and a \nphoto stacking method (Helicon Focus ver. 7). \nThe temperature was measured by using Assmann \npsychrometer in four constant points; the first one was \nlocalised outside the caves close to the cave entrance, \nand three inside the caves, according to the place of \ntraps (Fig. 2B). The average annual RH value inside \nthe cave was ascertained based on psychrometric \ntables. \nMethods of the ecological analyses \nFor ecological analyses, the number of species \nwith sample sizes were used for each of the studied \ncaves. Dominance and faunistic similarity index were \ncalculated. The analysis of the dominant species \nwas based on the number of specimens in the total \nsample. The ecological classification was based on \nSket’s (2008) concept. To evaluate the similarity of \nheleomyzid flies’ community, the Jaccard index and \nWard’s method with Euclidean distance were used. \nThese analyses were made by using Past3 software. \nRESULTS\nHistorical overview\nSo far, 17 species from Polish caves are known. \nThe species list is presented in Table 2. The highest \nnumber of species were found in the Tatra Mts and in \nthe Kraków-Częstochowa Upland. The least number of \nspecies was collected in the Sudety Mts. Additionally, \nthe occurrence of Oecothea praecox Loew (1862) in the \nPolish part of the Sudety area is currently doubtful \nsince no specimens have been found in the museum \n', '206 Kocot-Zalewska and Woźnica\nInternational Journal of Speleology, 50 (2), 203-211.

Nonetheless, there is no data about \nheleomyzid flies in the caves of Świętokrzyskie Mts, \nNida Basin, Carpathian Mts (Fig. 1). \nCurrent data\nIn total, 179 specimens of heleomyzid flies have \nbeen collected, which belong to 16 species.

The checklist of species is listed in Table \n2. Seven species were common for both years. These \nwere: Eccoptomera obscura, E. pallescens, Heleomyza \ncaptiosa, H. serrata, Oecothea fenestralis, Scoliocentra \nbrachypterna, S. villosa. The following species were \ndominant: Scoliocentra brachypterna, Heleomyza \ncaptiosa, and Eccoptomera pallescens (Fig. 3). Among \n23 heleomyzid species known from Polish caves, 1 has \nbeen regarded as eutroglobiont, 11 as eutroglophiles, \n9 as subtroglophiles, and 2 as trogloxenes (Table 2).\n', '207Cave-dwelling heleomyzid flies from the Polish caves\nInternational Journal of Speleology, 50 (2), 203-211. Tampa, FL (USA) May 2021\nAn analysis of species richness has been made. In \nthe Kroczycka and Towarna caves, there were only \n3-4 species observed. In these caves, an abundance \nof the heleomyzid flies was also the least numerous. \nWhereas in the Psia and Zegar caves, seven species per \ncave were collected and a high number of specimens \n(Fig. 4). \nThe species richness and abundance analyses have \nalso been made according to the cave zones, and \naltogether for all studied caves. In the entrance zones, \nthe highest number of species was noticed, however, \nthe highest number of specimens was observed in the \nmiddle of the caves and at the end of the caves. In the \nimmediate surroundings of the caves, the lowest number \nof species, as well as specimens, was found (Fig. 5).\nAn average annual air temperature inside the caves \nwas 6-7oC, while outside the caves, the average annual \ntemperature was higher; 9oC (Fig. 5). The coldest cave \nis Pod Sokolą with an average annual temperature ca \n4.4oC (Table 1). More significant differences concerned \naverage annual amplitude of temperature. In the \nentrance zone it was 26oC; 14oC in the middle of the \npassages, and 5oC at the end of the caves. Whereas \noutside the caves it was 37oC.\nFig. 4. Species richness and abundance of the Heleomyzidae family in studied caves.\nFig. 5. Species richness and abundance of the Heleomyzidae family according to the cave’ zone,  \nand average annual air temperature and annual amplitude of temperature.\nThe faunistic similarity analyses have been \nperformed using the Jaccard index (Fig. 6A) and \nWard’s method with Euclidean distance (Fig. 6B). The \nanalysis of faunistic similarity indicates that the Psia, \nPod Sokolą, and W Zielonej Górze caves are rather \nalike, whereas the Towarna Cave is dissimilar to other \ncaves. The analysis of the faunistic distance clearly \nshows two groups of caves. One of them assemblages \nfour caves (Fig. 6B), among which the three most \nsimilar caves are (Fig. 6A).\nDISCUSSION\nBased on historical data and this study, an update \nof a checklist of heleomyzid flies inhabiting caves \nin different regions of Poland has been presented. \nCurrently, the list concerns 23 species belonging to \nseven genera (Table 2).\nThe highest diversity of species has been identified \nin the entrance zone of caves, and the fewest at the \nend of these; this is typical for non-troglobiont fauna \n(e.g., Skalski, 1973; Tobin et al., 2013). Despite \nlower species’ richness in deep parts of the caves, \nthere occurred communities of the largest number of \nspecimens. It might be due to the relative stability of \nclimatic conditions, like temperature. The temperature \namplitude was lower by half in the middle of the caves \nin relation to the entrance zone, and much lower at \nthe end of the caves with a result of 5oC. The lowest \nspecies richness as well as species abundance was \n', '208 Kocot-Zalewska and Woźnica\nInternational Journal of Speleology, 50 (2), 203-211. Tampa, FL (USA) May 2021 \nFig. 6. A) The faunistic similarity of heleomyzid species composition (Jaccard index); B) The faunistic distance of heleomyzid \nspecies composition (Ward’s method with Euclidean distance) in the studied caves.\nobserved outside the caves near the entrances. It is \nhard to explain because most of the entrances were \nsurrounded by forest, and only one (Towarna) lies at \nthe top of the hill in an unforested area. Therefore, \nthis environment should promote occurrence of \nheleomyzid species, which prefer cool and shaded \nplaces to live, and their larval stages are related to \nfungi and decaying matter (Dely-Draskovits, 1972; \nLo Giudice & Woźnica, 2013). Perhaps very high \ndiurnal and annual amplitude of air temperature or \nair humidity fluctuations are the reasons for sparce \noccurrence in this particular area. More research is \nneeded to get a detailed explanation.\nLooking at the number of specimens in these \nparticular caves, we could address the fauna in the \nZegar, Psia, and Pod Sokolą caves. All these caves \nhave large entrance zones (Table 1), which promote \nthe penetration of fauna. These caves also have the \nhighest degree of similarity among studied caves, as \nwell as forming a common group in Ward’s method. \nAccording to the Jaccard’s index, the most similar \nfauna occurred in the Pod Sokolą and the Psia caves. \nIt should be noted that in both caves, a very rare \nspecies, Scoliocentra confusa was present (Fig. 2D). \nThis is a boreal-montane species with an unknown \nbiology, hitherto recorded in South Poland only \n(Woźnica, 2007). The faunistic distance corresponds \nto the geographic distance (Fig. 2A, 6B) except for the \nTowarna and Kroczycka caves. The first one lies in \nthe northern part of the study area and the second \nin the centre. Both characterise a small number of \nspecies.\nThe three dominant species: Scoliocentra \nbrachypterna, Heleomyza captiosa, and Eccoptomera \npallescens also have a strong affinity for the winter \nseason and could be classified as a snow species \n(Soszyńska-Maj & Woźnica, 2016). The low temperature \ninside the cave combined with the occurrence of bat \nguano promotes the settlement of these insects. \nBat guano is common in the Częstochowa Upland \ncaves as a consequence of winter occurrence of \nmany bat species (Postawa & Ignaczak, 2017). It was \nalso observed in studied caves (unpublished data). \nThis in turn, favours the philopatry in subsequent \ngenerations, effects in making stable populations \ninside the caves. Populations created by the same \nabove-mentioned species are also found in other cave \nregions, for example, in Slovak caves (Košel, 2004). All \ndominant species are typical European taxa; Central \nEurope is the centre of their occurrence. The larval \nstages of Scoliocentra brachypterna and Heleomyza \ncaptiosa develop in bat or bird guano (Beron et al., \n2011), which explains their abundance in the caves in \nmountainous regions, like Tatra Mts (Kowalski, 1955). \nWhat is remarkable is the absence of cold-preferring \nspecies from the genus Heteromyza in the studied \ncaves. The lack of Heteromyza species could be \nexplained by the relatively high temperature inside the \ncaves, which is between 6-8oC (Skalski, 1994/1995; \nDumnicka & Płotek, 2013; Kocot-Zalewska, 2017). \nAdditionally, the studied caves are small and \nlimestone-built. During the day, limestone heats well, \nbut then it loses its temperature very quickly, so the \ndaily temperature amplitude is high. It could have a \nsignificant impact on larval stages of this genus. The \ncold-preferring genus Heteromyza was collected from \nTatra Mts, where the annual mean temperature in the \ncaves was lower, between 2.5-5.5oC (Kowalski, 1955). \nThe difference to air temperature and its amplitude in \ncaves in above-mentioned regions, results from caves \nlocation in these regions as well as local climate. The \nentrances of the caves in Tatra Mts lie high, above \n1,000 m.a.s.l. (Kowalski, 1955), while the entrances \nof the Częstochowa Upland lie definitely lower, 300400\nm.a.s.l. (Szelerewicz & Górny, 1986). Moreover, \nthe Częstochowa Upland is significantly warmer than \nTatra Mts (Kondracki, 2002).\n Determining heleomyzid’ ecological classification, \nits occurrence in both seasons and inhabiting \ndifferent parts of caves were taken. Concerning \nspecies from historical data, firstly, the collection sites \nfrom the literature were analysed and, secondly, the \nclassification of heleomyzid flies by Zaenker et al. (2020) \nwas used. The species, considered as eutroglophiles, \nhave been collected during both seasons in all zones \nof the caves, for example, Scoliocentra brachypterna \n', '209Cave-dwelling heleomyzid flies from the Polish caves\nInternational Journal of Speleology, 50 (2), 203-211. Tampa, FL (USA) May 2021\nand Eccoptomera pallescens. These species are also \nknown as eutroglophiles from subterranean areas \nin other countries (Zaenker et al., 2020). Although \nEccoptomera obscura was not included in this group, \ndespite its occurrence in both seasons, it was detected \nonly in the entrance zone of the studied caves. This \nspecies was considered as subtroglophile, the same \nclassification can be found in Zaenker et al. (2020). \nThe species that were reported during only one season, \nbut in deeper zones of the caves, were recognised as \nsubtroglophiles, for instance, Scoliocentra confusa. \nThe species that only occurred in the entrance zone of \nthe caves, for example, Suillia bicolor were considered \nto be trogloxenes. Our ecological classification of \nheleomyzid flies is mostly similar to this by Zaenker \net al. (2020). However, there are some differences, for \nexample we considered Eccoptomera pallescens and \nGymnomus caesius as eutroglophile, while Zaenker et \nal. (2020) as a subtroglophile. In turn, we recognized \nHeleomyza modesta and Scoliocentra dupliseta as \nsubtroglophile, whereas Zaenker et al. (2020) as a \neutroglophile.\nThe specimens of the Suillia genus could occur in \ncaves accidentally. They are a mycotrophic species \nand may develop in the entrance zones, where \nfungi often occur. In the case of the other species of \nheleomyzid flies, that have been found in the studied \ncaves (e.g., Eccoptomera sp., Gymnomus sp., or \nHeleomyza sp.), their larval development is associated \nwith rodents’ burrows, and other mammals living in \nforest ecosystems (Soszyńska-Maj & Woźnica, 2016). \nSo, these could provide reasons for why they also live \nin the caves, even in the dark parts (e.g., Gymnomus \ncaesius and G. amplicornis in the Slovakian caves; \nKošel, 2004).\nWe can assume that the Diptera, including the \nHeleomyzidae family occurring in the caves of the \nKraków-Częstochowa Upland, consists of relatively \nyoung fauna. During the glaciation periods, the \nCzęstochowa Upland was not completely covered \nby a continental glacier, but the whole region had \nbeen influenced by a periglacial climate, thereafter \nfluvioglacial sediments filled hollows which composed \nof sand and gravel layers (Lewandowski, 2009). \nHowever, over Pliocene and Pleistocene, changes in \nthe climate ensued several times in the aftermath \nof consecutive phases — stadials and interstadials \nof glaciations. As a result, the faunal composition \nwas modified a few times, and the effects can now \nbe observed in vertebrate bones found in layers. \nParticularly insectivore fauna bones are interesting \nbecause they prove the occurrence of insects. But \nwhat is remarkable is that there is a gap in fauna \nresidues that reveals a period of approximately 0.5 \nmillion years (Stefaniak et al., 2009). This indicates \nthe most intensive impact of San II glaciation during \nwhich no fauna occupied this region. To sum up, \nmodern fauna, including heleomyzid flies, had to \ninhabit this region not earlier than after the San II \nglaciation.\nThe highest number of species has currently been \nfound in the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland. However, \nthis is not a conclusive result because research has \nnot been conducted in this subject for a long time in \nother cave regions; in several regions, research has \nnot yet been undertaken at all. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe material was collected with permission of \nRegional Directorate for Environmental Protection \n(RDOŚ) in Katowice: WPN.6205.49.2014.MM, \nWPN.6401.484.2014.MS, and Kraków: OP-I.6401. \n2.2015.MMr. We are grateful to Leonora Ippolito for the \nrevision of the English. We also thank the reviewers \nfor their careful reading of our manuscript and their \nmany insightful comments and precious suggestions.\nAuthorship statement: JK-Z: the idea of the article, \ncollected the data, performed the ecological analysis, \nwrote the text, AJW: determined the species, performed \na historical overview, wrote the text.\nREFERENCES\nArndt, W., 1921.
