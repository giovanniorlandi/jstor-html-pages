With Habits of the\nPesky Boli Weevil, Has Been Discov\nered Efforts For its Extermi-nation.\nF. C. Pratt and A. McLachlan,\nof the Agricultural Department, are\nanions the recent arrivals at the\nMenger Hotel. Mr. Pratt is here\nmaking an investigation into the\nlife and customs of the authonomus\naeneotinctus, or pepper weevil as\nit is commonly called, while Mr.\nMcLachlan is one " of the Guate\nmalan ant experts.\nIn speaking of the pepper wee\nvil, Mr. Pratt said many people are\nof opinion the insect is the same as\nthe boll weevil, and that it has ex\ntended its crusade-to other plants\nbesides cotton. This is an error;,\nhowever, for the pepper weevil is\nan entirely different insect, though\nthe habits are almost identical.\nMr- Pratt says the Department is\nseeking information and Dr. Hun\nter, of Dallas, is making extensive\nexaminations throughout the State\nand endeavoring to get all Jthe\nfarmers throughout Texas to co\noperate with htm in exterminating\nthe pepper weevil."\nThe insect is claimed to have its\norigin in Mexico. More pepper is\nraised in that country than any\nwhere else and during the past few\nyears the damage to the crops has\nbeen great and the loss is laid to\nthe pepper weevil. It has been no\nticed during the past year that the\npepper crop of Texas has been af\nfected by the insect and a scientific\nstudy is now being carried on by\nagricultural experts in order to find\nsome means of exterminating the\nweevil. v\nThe life of the anthonomus\naeneotinctus is sedentary. It is\nreally born in the pepper berry and\nlives within the berry until it has\ndone all the damage possible. It\nthen seeks other plants. " ;\nMr. Pratt has just returned from\nCorpus Christi where he made many\ninvestigations. He said Tuesday\nnight he will remain in this part of\n1 the State several days and will be\npleased to. talk over the insect with\nany planter who has had an exper\nien;e with the pepper destroyer.\nS. A. Express.\nFertilizer Experiment Profitable.\nS B. Yates last spring tried\nacid phosphate fertilizer on an acre\nof sand land on his farm a few\nmiles below town and, at our re\nquest, keRt a record of the yield\nof this acre and the adjoining acre,\nplanted at the same time, on the\nsame quality ofjspil and with the\nsame work ancT attention. Here\nare the results:\nYield seed cotton, fertilized\n1033. lbs.\nYield seed cotton, unfertilized\n679 lbs.\nCash received from fertilized\nacre $32 49\nCash received from unfertilized\n- acre 20 37\nCash difference favor fertilized\nacre $12 12\nCost of fertilized 2 00\nNet difference favor fertilizer,\nper acre $10 12\nThese figures speak for them\nselves and need no argument to\nshow the profit and advantage to\nbe derived from fertilizers on light\nlands. On heavy black land the\ndifference will probably not be so\n-marked, though probably even on\nthis class of soil the use of fertilizers\nwould be prcfitable. Cut this out\nand file it away for future reference\nand don\'t forget it when plant\ning time conies.

T\nPrassic aciu i-i the most rapid\np\'oison a numan being call take.\nFrom\nSan Francisco, Cal., Oct. 24.\nUnited States Senator Newlands\nof Nevada, who has just returned\nfrom a visit to the Orient, has\nmade the following statement re\ngarding conditions in the Philip\npines: "The Philippines" are ver3r at\ntractive, and the people are in\nteresting and capable of much\ndevelopment. The commission is\nconscientiously working, out the\nproblems of good government with\nan eye single to the advancement\nand prosperity of the Filipino peo\nple. It retains the impression\nTaft made upon them when Gov\nernor General, and which was\nemphasized in a series of speeches\nexceptional in their strength and\nelevation of character. But the\ndifficulties are great. The Phil\nippines are passing through a\ndepression perhaps unequaled in\ntheir experience, caused by a suc\ncession of calamities the war, the\nrinderpest, which destroyed the\ncarabao, a malady which destroyed\ntheir horses and mules; .the chol\nera, the locusts and the typhoons.\nThe islands are not prosperous,\nand the revenue is not sufficient to\naccomplish what the Government\nhas set out to do.\n"The sugar and tobacco interests\nare languishing. The suggestion\nof the administration is to restore\nthese by giving free access to the\nUnited States markets for their\nproducts- I am not convinced\nthat this is the best method. The\nsugar industry is suffering because\nof the calamities I have mentioned\nand because of the primitive\nmethods of production. Our tariff\nduty on raw sugar, which is nearly\n100 per cent, has doubled the price\nof sugar to the consumers. The\nPhilippines people can only get\n$60 per ton for their sugar in the\nworld\'s market, but in our markets,\nwith the duty off, they get $75 per\nton. Is it best for us to subsidize\nthe Filipino sugar planters by\ngiving them this extra price at the\nAmerican taxpayers\' expense, or\nwould it be better to aid them in\nsecuring, through agriculture,\'\nbanks or otherwise, the means of\nreforming their methods so as to\nenable them to accept the world\'s\nprice?\n"The commission is fully cap\nable of carrying out this latter\npolicy, and I believe that it would\nbe our duty to give the Philippines\ndirect aid in the shape of a loan on\nour credit for this purpose rather\nthan to attempt the method of\ngiving them artificial and subsidiz\ned prices for their products. I\nthink all are agreed in sustaining\nthe policy of the Philippines for\nthe Filipinos by training them in\nself-government and industrial\npursuits. But I think much\nthought should be given a to the\nmethod of our aid."\nTEN YEARS FOR CANAL.\nRandolph Expects to See It Utilized in\n. 1915.\nWashington, Oct. 24. Isham\nRandolph, identified with the Chi\ncago drainage canal,- and now a\nmember of the board of consulting\nengineer on thePanama Canal, gave\nout today the iQtig letter addressed\nto Zina R. Carter, president of the\nsanitary district of Chicago, in\nwhich he says:\n"We may reasonably look lor\nthe passage of the great freighters\nfrom the Caribbean Sea to the Pa\ncific before our calendars are head- j\ned 1915.\no,ini, offK,,tM ,,.\n, the discomfort suffered, on the Isth -\nmust by employes from the North\nto tW ntrrn icmnnnro TT nrlmJfc\nto their own ignorance.

An\nticipating t big revival in Russia\nas a result of the close of the war,\nthere is a regular influx of foreign\ners1 seeking commercial opportu\nnities and concessions, including a\nliberal sprinkling of Americans\nwho believe the time is especially\npropitious for them. The disturb\ned political conditions and the\nstrikes, however, are temporarily\nengrossing the attention of the\nGovernment. Besides this the Min\nister of Finance is devoting all his\nattention to the new loan negotia\ntions, and up to the present time\nthe concession hunters have made\nno progress. A representative of\nan American syndicate has submit\nted elaborate plans for the prospec\ntive reconstructing of trans-Caucasia,\nCentral Asia and Tashkend\nwith the trans-Siberian and Tomsk\nline, which is not only important\nstragetically in facilitating mobili\nzation on the Indo frontier, but be\ncause it traverses the well watered\nlake region. The road involves the\nexpenditure of $15,000,000. The\nsyndicate asks the \'Government to\nguarantee the interest onthe bonds\nand to grant mining and other con\ncessions. Robert Gross, representing Amer\nican locomotive manufacturers, is\nafter franchises for new equipment.\nof which the railways of the Em\npire is in urgent need.\nLewis Nixon, who is closing up-\ndeals for ten torpedo boats to be set\nup in the Black Sea, and which are\nnow in the Baltic, is also awaiting\ndevelopments. The Government\nnaval contracts and big contracts\nfor the electrization of the street\ncar systems of St. Petersburg and\nWarsaw are also about to be let.\nThe Westinghouse people are\nbidding for both of these electrical\ncontracts, and repteseutative of\nOuray, Verner & Sellers McKee of\nPittsburg are bidding for the form\ner. Charles R. Flint also, has sever\nal projects in hand.\n"Didn\'t that hurt- you, sir?"\nThe clerical looking gentleman in\nthe rear seat of the trolley car turn\ned inquiringly to the nicely dressed\nand clean cut young man who sat\nbeside him, as that individual winc\ned slightby, for his foot had just\nbeen stepped on by a portly man\nwho was leaving the car.\n"Yes, sir it hurt very much,"\n"he said, simply.\n"I thought so," said theclericat\nman. "Allow me to congratulate\nyou on your control. Observed\nwith pleasure, sir, that no oath\nsprang to your lips; :r Great pleas\nuse to meet a young man like you.\nHave a cigar?"\n"Thank you. I don\'t smoke."\nsaid the young niau.\n"Splendid!" exclaimed the cler\nical interrogator. "I smoke my\nself," he said, "because I lead a\nsedentary life. But I glory in a\nyoung man who doesn\'t. May I\ninquire, sir, if you know the taste\nof Iiqror?\'.\'\nNo, sir, never touched a drop."\nHis new friend clasped him by the\nhand. There were tears in his\neyes.\n"Remarkable!" he exclaimed.\n"In these uuregenerate days it is\nindeed soul-satisfying to gaze\nupon such a model. May I ask,\nuiy dear friend, what high motive\ni.npels you to abstain from these\ninfluences, .that are sapping the\nhfeblood from the nation?"\nThe young man smiled.\n"Certainly." he replied "The\njfact is, sir, I find that I can\'t disi-\nP3le ad deal a\ntaro nank at the\n\' ... . . ... 1 . .\n\'\nj li a man laughs always, set him-\ndow aS foolish; if "ever, as false..\n-Balthasor Gracian.\nTobacco seals are so minute that\ni a thimble will contain enough to\n! sow over an acre of ground.', 'THE DAILY HERALD.\nJesse O.

It will also be well tojsend the\nexhibit to the Houston Carnival\nwhich closes about the time of open\ning of the San Antonio fair.\nGovernment Returns Necklace.\nNew York. Rather than take\nchances on the result of litigation\nover a $22i000 pearl necklace\nwhich is now in the custody of\nCollector Stranahan, the govern\nment will accept a check for the\namount of duty and return the\njewels to the woman who owns\nthem. This is the conclusion\nwhich Leslie M. Shaw, secretary\nof the treasury, reached after con\nferring with Mr. Stranahan yesterday.\nThe necklace was brought into\nthe country without the payment\nof duty by a woman whose name\nthe-customs officials have conceal\ned. She succeeded in getting the\nnecklace by the inspectors on the\npier, bat the treasury department\nearned of the purchase abroad.\nWhen they failed to find any\nrecord of it among the declarations\nof passengers on incoming steam\nships secret service agents were\nsent to watch the woman who was\nsuspected of having evaded the\npayment, of duty. She was fol-j\nowed from this city to Philadel\nphia, Boston and Chicago, and\nwas finally informed that customs\nofficials were watching her. A\nlawyer then called upon the Col-\nector and offered a check, for\n$13,000" in payment of duty.\nMr. Sttanhan insisted upon the\nsurrender of the necklace. He\nplaced it in a safe deposit vault\nand sent a report on the matter to\nWashington. Influential friends\nof the woman appealed in her be\nhalf to the Treasury Department\nofficials, and with the result of the\nDulles trial and other prolonged\nand unsuccesslul litigation over\njewelry iu mind, the Government\nofficials have practically decided to\ntake the woman\'s check and call\nincident closed.\nWe might have some difficulty\nin proving that the necklace which\nis now in our custody is identical\nin all respects with the necklace\nwhich was brought in without the\npayment of duty," said Secretary\nShaw, at the Fifth Avenue Hotel\nlast night, "it is better, I think,\nto accept payment for the duty\nand return the necklace to the\nowner."\n"Who is the owner?"\n\'"I do not think it necessary to\ngive her name.

CRKELL & BRO.\nSupreme Court Says Failure to Pay Di$\nqualifies Jurors.\nAustin, Tex., Oct. 24. The su\npreme court rendered a most im\nportant opinion yesterday morning\nholding that the failure to pay poll\ntax disqualifies a person for jury\nservice. It was in the case of San\nAntonio and Aransas Pass Railway\nCompany vs. Joseph L. Lester, in\nwhich the road had been held for\n$10,000 damages for personal in\njuries to Lester, who was an en\ngineer and jumped from his engine\nwhen a collision was inevitable. A\ncaboose standing on the main line\nfailed to have its cupola lights\nburning and no flagman was sent\nback.\nThe railroad company objected\nto four of the jurors because they\nhad not paid their poll tax and the\nobjection was overruled, the court\npermitting them to sit on the\nground that the mixed population\nof Bexar county, where 7402 per\nsons had paid poll tax, and the\nthree district courts in session,\nnecessitated the using of said per\nsons for jury service as they could\nread and write the English lan\nThe court, through Justice Brown,\nthen states that the court below\ncontended that it could dispense\nwith the qualifications under the\ncircumstances, and sets out article\n3139, revised statutes, which says\nthe tax must be paid, except where\nit is made to appear that sufficient\njurors who Khave paid the tax can\nnot be foundin the county.\nJudge Biown writes that the\ncourt below appears to think it dis\ncretionary as to dispensing with\nthe statutory requirement and add:\n"if the.statute did authorize such\naction by a judge it would amount\nto a suspension of the law in Bexar\ncounty and would be void under\narticle 1. section 28, of the consti\ntution, which provides: \'No power\nof suspending the laws in this state\nshall be exercised except by the\nlegislature.\' "\nJudge Brown said if it had been\n"made to appear" that the re\nquisite number of jurors could not\nhave been secured then the require\nment could have dispensed with,\nbut that alone.\nReferring to the district judge\'s\nstatement of mixed population in\nBexar county and the fact that\nbut few thereof understand the Eng\nligh language, Judge Bro.vn wrote:\n"The reasons assigned by the dis\ntrict judge would have appealed\nstrongly to the legislature to exempt\nBexar county from the operation\nof the law, but they do not make\nit appear that a sufficient number\nof jurors could not be found to try\nthat case "\nThe point is made that the rail\nroad suffered an injury from the\nfinds the statute mandatory and\nthe positive right thereunder de\nnied, adding: "If it was not im\nportant for jurors to possess the\nqualifications prescribed the legis\nlations prescribed, the legislators\nwasted their time in so enacting.\nThe question of the importance of\nthe right to the defendant is not a\nmatter for judicial determination;\nthat has already been decided by\nthe legislature, and, the defendant\nhaving been denied a positive legal\nright, suffered an injury which en\ntitles it to a reversal of this judg\nment." Another feature is embraced in\nthe opinion and it is Judge\nBrown\'s language referring ,to\nassignment of error that the court\'s\ncharge was negative, tnat is, m\nstating that if the engineer failed\nto keep a sharp lookout and failed\nto nave his tram under control as\nhe approached the meeting point,\nthen it was negligence. Judge\nBrown says the charge was correct\nand adds: This question has\nbeen presented to this court so\nfrequently of late that it suggests\nthe propriety of calling attention\nof the bar to the following cases\nupon which the objection is based:\nRailway Company vs. McCoy. 90\nTex., 264; Railway Company vs.\nRowland, ib. 365; and Culpepper\nvs. I. &.
