You, are full of health and new found, strength. Maybe you are growing up, harder than most boys ? your bills, for breaks have been numerous and, large ? out I only love you the more, for your high spirit. There is only, one thing you might do that 1 could, not forgive ? to hurt a woman.", ? ? ?, It Is the prayer of every mother,, though too few mothers take their, sons into their confidence as did Auu, Mary. Too many mothers tell theii, sons too late, or not at all. To the, sou who is honest such a prayer from, his mother\'s lips would never be for, gotten. would live in his concienee, and guide him and save womankind, from much of its deepest sorrow and, sharpest pain., Such suggestion properly comes to, a son from his mother., I* is false modesty which prevents, a mother from dealing frankly with, her children in the great life ques, tions. Unfortunate is the boy or, girl who has not heard from a, mother\'s lo\\ing lips the truth con, cerning proper life conduct., Men do not like to have it said,, but few will deny that in them the, animal would be paramount if not re, straim-d by woman\'s finer sense and, the conventionality that men have, themselves built up to curb thcmselvtd, and protect women from man\'s ruth, less self-gratification., To our mothers we look for the, more refilling influences. The best, influences upon men are inherited, from their mother a:ul grandmothers., Strength, intelligence and courage, may conie from father and grandfath, er ? these, too. are coming more now, than ever before from our advanced, mothers? but the gentle touch of a, loving hand, the sweet sentiment of, life, the deep-seated moral balance, and the love of family ? these come, come from our mothers., ? ? ?, The one great irrepairable, irret, rievable, unforgivable crime is the, common crime of hurting a trusting, woman. ? Seattle Star., Some people think it the province, of a newspaper to take up every fac, tional row and to fight the battles, of the warring factions. They are, mistaken. A newspaper is just what, its name implies. Its chief reason, for being is to print \'he news. It, gives editorial comment upon the hap, peuings of the day. It Is likewise a, puveyor of legitimate advertising. It, should also guard the interests of the, people who patronize it. Farther, than this no newspaper is supposed, to go., It is to be hoped, but scarcely ex, pected. that the House of Represent, atives will oust Uncle Joe Cannon and, get a new speaker who Is in touch, with the more progressive spirit of, the country. Cannon h~s too long, acted as "The Old .Man of the Sea.", upon our national politics., The Latin-American temperament, demands trouble every so often. If, the rulers of the Central American, republics cannot supply their subjects, with a war every now and then *\'iere, is apt to be a revolution. Of course, the powers that be prefer a foreign, war to a domestic rebellion., If that Pullen house robbery had, taken place before instead of aftor, "That Box of Cigarettes," wo would, have Inclined to the belief that it was, a clever press agent stunt. We have, heard before of theatrical people los, ing Jewels., Congress convenes today and for, the next three months our national, law making body can l>c relied upon, to do its full share towards contribut, ing to the gaiety of nations., "When I was a child, 1 spake as a, child, 1 understood as a child.

But right, . here in the beginning I must break, [ away from my subject to tell a story., ? Margaret May charmed nie lo what, I 1 consider the higher trails.

I am not a man to be pleased, . with a gay, frolk >tue I. however, | kind hearted, however winning. It, ? was, therefore, natural that 1 Mould, f yield to the characteristics of Marga, ? ret.

One, evening when I went to see her she, bounded into the room like a holden., 5 throw her arms about my neck, kissed, 1 me several times in rapid succession, J and. Iicgluuing with "You bad l<oy,", f upbraided me for not having come, ; earlier. When I asked her for what, : she had wished ine, she said that a cir, \' i\'us had come to town, and she was, 1 "dying" to attend that evening\'s per, formance. Astonished. I asked her If, the next night would not do as well., She said It would not. and when I, 1 pressed her for a reason the only one, she could give was that she couldn\'t, watt., it was altogether too late lo go to the, I circus that oveni >g, so I spent the rest, , of it with her In the > :y library where, we had pasned so many happv hour.-;,, often taking book after book from the, : shelves, rambling In them together and, 1 calling each other\'s attention to favor, . Ite passages. Hut, alas, there was no, ) such enjoyment for us tonight. Mar, garet spoke of the Isiok ? as "musty,, dusty things." In which she had no in, to rest, and Insisted In talk Iiik ouly, upon tlw most frivolous topics., It Is needless to say that 1 was not, only dlsap; : nt>\'il. hut shocked. Could, this 1?< my steady, well balanced, In, I tellectua! dargnrct? I v. is inclined, ! ;o doubt It. Could it be her twin sister?, I knew that she had n>> twin sister. I, endured her prattle as long as I was, able; theu, telling her that 1 had some, s work to do before going to bed. I, t rose to go., "And you will take uie to the circus, 1 tomorrow night?" she asked, with a, pout., s "Certainly if you wish it." 1 replied, ^ and wheu I could escape from an ex, j. u be ranee of caresses left her., t That night and the nest day my, I brain was in a turmoil. I was like a, man who had 1 . his love. 1 brooded, , Instead < f working tiil after office, hours and In the evening called to, take Margaret to the circus. The, maid who received me at the door, went upstairs to announce me and. re, turning. told me that Miss May was, not feeling well and had gone to l?\'d., There was no message of disap|H>lut, t went at missing the performance nor, nt not seeing me. Indeed, the timid, told me that she thought her mistress, : had not expected me that evening., 1 This would have been natural had It, " not been for the engagement, since, It was an evening I seldom called,, l\' The next of my usual weekly visits, I was Sunday, and I called, dreading to, again tind the holdcu. I was ngree, s ably disappointed. Margaret was her, il usual self except that she showed, i ; signs of overstrained nerves.

Finally I re, y ferred to her desire to \\ Islt the circus,, t She seemed surprised, mystified, and, when I told her the whole story said,, with a nervous tremor, "Oh. she\'ll, (> rulu me!", s\' "Was some "tie else than you with, " me that evening?" 1 asked., "Yes? ui\'. 1 was with you, but she, n dominated me."
