        <pre>['Published September, 1943\nGRASSES FERTILIZED WITH NITROGEN COMPARED WITH \nLEGUMES FOR HAY AND PASTURE1 \nB. A. BRowN AND R. I. MuNSELL2 \nW HEN the war ends, some of the products of the synthetic nitrogen factories may be available for purposes other than \nmunitions. For some time this question has been under study by a \njoint committee of the American Society of Agronomy, the American \nSociety for Horticultural Science, the Association of Land-Grant \nColleges and Universities, the National Fertilizer Association, the \nTennessee Valley Authority, and the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. The \ngeneral idea appears to be that if nitrogen in fertilizers should be \nrelatively cheaper than before the war, it might be a good policy for \nfarmers to increase their use of this important plant nutrient. \nFor many years, the Agronomy Department of the Storrs, Conn., \nAgricultural Experiment Station has had hundreds of plots on which \nthe response of grasses to various rates and times of application of \nnitrogenous fertilizers has been determined. On the same field and \nduring the same seasons, legumes and legume-grass mixtures have \nbeen under test. It is the purpose of this paper to present the many \ndata now available on these comparisons. All of the experiments were \nlocated at or near Storrs, on Charlton fine sandy loam soil, which, \nbecause of its compact subsoil, retains water relatively well and is \ntherefore one of the best soil types in Connecticut for the growth of \ngrasses. \nTIMOTHY FOR HAY \nTimothy is the chief grass grown for hay in the hay-dairy belt of \nNorth America. Usually it is seeded with red clover, but after the \nsecond season, the clover is largely gone and the growth of the \ntimothy is retarded for lack of nitrogen, unless topdressed with manure\nor nitrogenous fertilizers. To learn what changes in quantity and \nquality of hay could be obtained with nitrogen and different dates of \ncutting, a 1931 seeding of red clover and timothy was divided in 1933 \ninto duplicated, 1oo X 10 foot plots which were fertilized and mowed \nas outlined in Table 1. By 1938, the stand of timothy had become \nconsiderably mixed with other grasses, so the field was plowed and \nreseeded to timothy and a similar experiment continued through \n1941. The pertinent results for the period of 1939-41 are presented \nin Table 2. For comparison, the yields of alfalfa from nearby plots \nand during the same years are included in Table I and yields of \nLadino mixtures in Table 2. \nIt is apparent that the added nitrogen was responsible for marked \nincreases in yields of both dry matter and protein from the timothy \nin the s-year period 1933-37. If not cut before june 15, each of the \ntwo 28-pound increments of nitrogen enhanced the dry matter by \n9oo to 1 ,2oo pounds. It will be noted, however, that the protein \n1Contribution from the Department of Agronomy, Connecticut Agricultural \nExperiment Station, Storrs, Conn.

This was due to the \ndeclining percentage of protein with the increasing percentage of \ncarbohydrates, as the timothy became more mature. Fiber increased \nfrom about 2 2 to 3 2% during the month of June. Even where nitrogen \nat s6 pounds was applied, the grass in the first cutting had absorbed \nthe maximum amount by June 1. Fertilizer nitrogen at either 28 or \ns6 pounds caused greater growth but did not raise the percentage \nof protein. In this respect, the date of cutting was very important, \nas may be judged by. the fact that on June I the protein content was \nI2%; on June IS .• 9%; and on June 30, 7%. Protein is emphasized, \nnot because animal rations cannot be balanced economically with \noil meals, etc., but because usually there is a close correlation between\nprotein and several other animal nutrients which indicate im-\nproved quality, like fat (ether extract) and the essential minerals. \nTABLE I.-The effects of nitrogen and dates of cutting on the yields of timothy, \nNitrogen applied, \npounds per acret \nNone ................ . \n28 in April ........... . \n28 in April; 28 in June .. \n56 in April. .......... . \nNone; alfalfa, 2 cuttings \nin medium bloom stage \nNone ................. \n28inApril ............ \n28 in April, 28 in June .. \n56 in April ............ \nNone; alfalfa, 2 cuttings \nin medium bloom stage \ni9JJ-37·* \nFirst cutting Second cutting \non following first cutting.on \nJune June June June June \nI IS 30 I IS \nDry Matter, Cwts. per Acre \nIO I6 23 8 4 \n20 29 35 7 4 \n20 3I 35 16 9 \n25 39 46 6 5 \nProtein, Pounds per Acre \n128 I6I I8I 88 so \n248 240 237 ss 48 \n242 27I 228 I27 III \n34I 348 335 74 62 \n- - - - June\n30 \n4 \n3 \n5 \n4 \nso \n46 \n74 \n59 \nTotals\nif first \ncutting on \nJune \nI \nIS \n27 \n36 \n3I \n2I6 \n333 \n388 \n4I4 \nJune\nIS \n20 \n33 \n40 \n44 \n56 \n2II \n288 \n383 \n4IO \n. 840:1: \nJune \n30 \n23I \n283 \n302 \n394 \n*At\nStorrs timothy is in bloom the last part of June: The dates of second cuttmgs vaned m \nsome years; not in others. \ntJune N was applied after the first cutting. \ntThe alfalfa was not analyzed in those years. so used one of the lowest percentages (IS%) .ever \nfound in alfalfa at Storrs for calculating the yield of protein. \nWhen June rs was the date of first cutting and a second application \nof nitrogen was added soon afterwards, a total yield of fair weight \nand quality was obtained. This system produced 4,ooo pounds of dry \nmatter and nearly 400 pounds of protein. An additional 1 ,ooo pounds \nof dry matter but no more protein resulted from applying s6 pounds \nof nitrogen in April and postponing the first cutting to June 30. In \nthe same seasons, however, alfalfa cut two times per season and not \nfertilized at all after seeding, produced 40 and 12% more dry matter \nthan the timothy cut first on June 15 and June 30, respectively, and \n', 'BROWN AND MUNSELL: NITROGEN FERTILIZATION OF GRASSES 813 \nover twice as much protein as the timothy in any of the various \nfertilizer-cutting systems. It should be pointed out that the alfalfa \nin question was not analyzed and so one of the lowest percentages of \nprotein every found in alfalfa at Storrs was used for the calculation \nof yield of protein. The lowest yield of protein from similarly cut \nalfalfa in another experiment during 1934 and 1935 was over 1,ooo \npounds per acre. \nThe 1939-41 results with the reseeded timothy are compared with \nthe averages of five Ladino-grass mixtures, also seeded in 1938. This \ncomparison is made because many farmers do not treat their soils and \nmanage their crops so as to succeed with alfalfa. Ladino clover is a \nperennial legume that will thrive under soil conditions satisfactory for \ngood results with timothy. For best results, however, Ladino-grass \nmixtures should be cut three times per.season, at least. The data presented\nin Table 2 are from plots cut four times each year. The fourth, \nor October cutting, yields much less than the others and could be \nomitted or grazed without detracting greatly from the total production\nof hay. \nTABLE 2.-Comparison of timothy with Ladino-grass mixtures for hay, \n1939-41. \nTotal pounds \nper acre \nNitrogen applied, Crops and cuttings \npounds per acre \nDry Protein \nmatter \nNone ................

Averages of five Ladino-grass mixtures\ncut four times per year 4.986 895 \nAs may be seen in Table 2, nitrogen at 28 pounds in April and again \nin June increased the total dry matter yields of timothy about 1,400 \npounds if the first cutting was June 12 and about 1,8oo pounds if cut \nfirst on June 29. Because there was some volunteer white clover in \nthe no-nitrogen plots, the use of fertilizer nitrogen resulted in only \nmeager increases in the yield of protein. During the same seasons, the \nLadino-grass mixtures averaged over one-third more dry matter \nthan the timothy cut first on June 12 and one-sixth more than the \ntimothy cut first on June 29. Moreover, the Ladino mixtures, with \nno fertilizer nitrogen, produced 141% more protein than the timothy \nto which was applied a total of 56 pounds of nitrogen each season. \nKENTUCKY BLUEGRASS AND RHODE ISLAND \nBENT GRASS FOR PASTURES \nThese two species are the chief grasses in improved permanent \npastures of northeastern United States. In August, 1935, pure seed-\n', '814 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nings of each grass were made on adjacent 100 X so foot bl0cks. In the \nearly spring of 1936, duplicate soX8 foot plots on each block of grass \nwere seeded to Ladino clover without tillage. During that and subsequent\nseasons, other plots of these grasses received nitrogen, \nchiefly in calnitro, at 28 pounds in each of the months of April, \nJune, and August. All plots were lawnmowed 4 inches to 1 inch, an \naverage of eight times per season for 7 years. The seasonal and total \nyields of dry matter and the average percentages of protein are \nshown in Table 3· It may be stated briefly that with either grass alone, \nthe effects of nitrogen at 84 pounds per season were not equal in \nquantity or quality of "pasturage to seeding Ladino clover with the \ngrasses. The only advantage of the pure grasses plus nitrogen was \nthat this system produced larger yields than the combination of \ngrass and clover during the first two weeks in May. · \nTABLE 3.--Grasses plus Ladino clover versus grasses plus fertilizer nitrogen \nfor pasture.* \nDry matter, pounds per acre \nPercent-\nTreatment Be- May June July Aug.

Nitrogen was applied to \ngrasses alone at 28 pounds in April, June, and August, or a total of 84 pounds per year. \ntValues given are average protein contents in 1937, 1938, and 1939. The crops were not analyzed\nin other years. \nNITROGEN ON PERMANENT PASTURES \nThe preceding discussion dealt with data obtained on tillable, \nseeded land, where it was possible to control to a considerable extent \nthe species on the plots. For 10 years, 1932 to 1941, nitrogen was \nadded at various dates and amounts to 7 of r 7 2-acre, quantitatively \ngrazed, permanent pastures. These pastures were grazed by yearling \ndairy heifers that received no supplemental feed. In Table 4 may be \nfound a summary of the results. \nAll of the nitrogen plots produced larger total yields than the \nminerals plots. Most of the additional feed, due to nitrogen, grew in \nMay and early June. This was especially true of the spring nitrogen \nplots. The least summer decline occurred on the pastures where \nnitrogen was withheld until June or August. The summer nitrogen, \nhowever, was much less effective in increasing growth than the spring \ntreatments. \n', 'BROWN AND MUNSELL: NITROGEN FERTILIZATION OF GRASSES 815 \nTABLE 4.-,Nitrogen and minerals versus minerals on permanent pastures.* \nNitrogen applied, pounds per acre Total digestible nutrients, pounds \nper a<;re \nTotal \nRates and dates per Before Junel6- After Total \nyear June 16 Aug. 15 Aug. 15 \n28inApril ................... 28 832 426 296 1,554 \n28 in April and June ........... 56 957 5II 328 1,796 \n28 in April, June, and August ... 84 975 510 360 1,845 \n56 in April. .................. 56 1,002 414 268 1,684 \n28inJune .................... 28 567 487 301 1,355 \n28 in August .................. 28 597 445 327 1,369 \n28 in June and August ......... 56 782 524 348 1,654 \nMinerals only ................ 0 614 422 211 1,247 \n*Results from grazed plots 1932 to 1941. Clover occupied about 6% of the area in theN plots; \nIS% in those treated with minerals only. \nIn May and June grasses decrease so rapidly in palatability and \nfeeding value that it is imperative to graze them to capacity during \nthose months in order to keep the herbage in a leafy condition. In this \nexperiment the spring nitrogen plots produced only 29% of the feed \nnecessary for their May-early June load of stock during the remainder \nof the season. The corresponding values for the other groups were as \nfollows: For the spring plus summer nitrogen group, 33%; for the \nminerals only pastures, 39%; and for the summer nitrogen plots, \n47%. In other words, the use of spring-applied nitrogen on pastures \nincreased the acreage of supplementary pastures or other feeds necessary\nto carry the same number of animals throughout the season. \nOn smooth land, surplus May-June pasturage can be mowed for \nhay or silage, but many of the permanent pastures in northeastern \nUnited States are too rough or steep for machine mowing. Moreover, \non most farms in this region there is a far greater acreage of land \nsuitable only for permanent pasture than there is for seeded pasture \nand other crops. Permanent pastures are probably the cheapest \nsource of feed for cattle. These data would seem to demonstrate that \nthe improvement of larger areas of permanent pastures by adding \nthe necessary minerals is a far better practice than intensive fertilization\nwith both minerals and nitrogen of a smaller area. Even on \nfanns with pastures smooth enough to permit machine mowing of \nsurplus May-June feed stimulated by spring nitrogen, it would seem \nto be a better practice to till and seed leguminous mixtures, which, as \nshown by the values in Tables 1, 2 and 3, will produce larger total and \nbetter distributed yields of forage than grasses receiving heavy applications\nof nitrogen. Moreover, if legumes are neither grazed nor \nmowed at a definite time, they do not depreciate in feeding value \nnearly so rapidly as the grasses. \nFERTILIZER NITROGEN ON LEGUMES \nIt has been stated by some that the nitrogen problem with forage \ncrops is not a question of fertilizer nitrogen or legumes, but fertilizer \n', '8r6 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nnitrogen and legumes. They suggest applying nitrogenous fertilizers \nto legumes as well as to grasses. The only data the Storrs Experiment \nStation has on this question are for nearly pure stands of alfalfa. \nWith that crop, nitrate of soda applied at I25 pounds in April andrepeated\nafter the June cutting to I2 of 36 plots in I934 and I935 \ncaused no significant differences in either protein content or yields of \ndry matter. Numerous tests with alfalfa have also shown that on \nwell-limed and phosphated soils,_the chief effect of stable manure is \ntraceable to its content of potash. It has been observed many times \nthat the heavy manuring of alfalfa resulted in severe lodging and the \nloss of most of the lower leaves. \nIn another experiment, the yields of some lawnmowed plots of \nturf grasses were not increased by applying nitrogen at 28 pounds in \neach of the months of April, June, and August when 40% or more of \ntheir areas were occupied by volunteer white clover.3 In this case, \nas well as in other experiments at the Storrs Experiment Station, the \nnitrogen, chiefly from sulfate of ammonia, reduced markedly the \nprevalence of the clover and, of course, made it impossible to determine\nthe yields of plots with both clover and fertilizer nitrogen. \nSUMMARY \nThe yields and quality of several grasses fertilized with nitrogen for \nhay and pasture are compared with those from legumes and legumegrass\nmixtures. \nDuring a s-year period, the yields of timothy were increased markedly\nby 28 .or 56 pounds of nitrogen per acre annually, but in the \nsame seasons alfalfa on nearby plots, unfertilized since seeding, produced\nmore dry matter and over twice as much protein. \nLadino clover-or.chard grass seedings also yielded more dry matter \nand much more protein than another stand of timothy fertilized \nwith 28 pounds of nitrogen in each of the months of April and June. \nThe seeding of Ladino clover .with either Kentucky bluegrass or \nRhode Island bent grass, l~wnmowed eight times per season for 7 \nyears, resulted in slightly larger total and better distributed yields \nthan the application of nitrogen at 28 pounds in each of the months \nof April, June, and August on the grasses alone. \nOn grazed permanent pastures, spring-applied nitrogen stimulated \na 30% increase in total yields over mineral fertilization. Most of the \nadditional growth occurred before June r6. Spring and summer \nnitrogen resulted in less May but more summer feed than from applying\nall of the nitrogen in April. The most uniform seasonal distribu-\ntion of pasturage was obtained by adding nitrogen only in the summer,\nbut the returns per unit of nitrogen were about half those from \nthe spring treatments. \n3Storrs (Conn.)
