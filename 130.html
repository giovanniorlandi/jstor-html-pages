TWICK~ A WEEK, SI .50) A YE AR\nJAPANESE YICTORIOUS\nIN TERRIBLE BATTLE\nBLOODIEST BATTLE OF PRES\nENT WAR.\nFighting Lasted More Than Ten\nDays-Casualties Will Far\nExceed ioo,ooo.\nTokio. March 8.-Advices received\nhere indicate that Gen. Kuropatkin is\nbadly beaten in the bloodiest battle of\nthe present war.\nMukden. March 8. 4.30 a. m.-The\nRussian army is evacuating its posi\ntions south of Mukden.\nMukden, March 8. io a. m.-A\nheavy cannonading is in progress\nnorthwest of this city, causing the\nwalls of houses here to tremble.\nAn engagement is in progress at\nthe imperial tombs.\nWashington, March 8.-The state\ndepartment is officially informed\nfrom Tokio that the Japanese have\nachieved a great victory before Muk\nden and that the Russian army is in\nfull retreat. The casualties are num\nerous on both sides.\nSt. Petersburg, March 9, 3 a. m.\nThe battle of Mukden, which has\nbeen in progress for more than ten\ndays, ha; resulted in a Russian de\nfeat.\nField Marshal Oyama has once\nmore proved himself one of the great\nest masters of offensive strategy\nsince Napoleon, while Gen. Kuropat\nkin is now engaged in endeavoring to\ndefend his title as a master of suc\ncessful re:reats and bring off his army\nwith its immense train safely to Tie\npass, where a position was long ago\nprepared with this contingency in\nview. The problem-before the Rus\nsian commander-in-chief is more dif\nficult than the one he met success\nfully at Liao Yang, since now he is\nthreatened on both flanks, his left\nwing being entangled in a mountain\nous region far from the railroad.\nNevertheless Russian military men\nhere express a fair degree of confi\ndence in Gen. Kuropatkin\'s ability\nonce more to extricate his army and\navoid a Russian Sendan. Besides his\nskill in rearguard action they base\ntheir hopes on the physical condition\nof the Japanese soldiers who, though\nthey are conceded to be the greatest\nmarchers in the world, are wvell nigh\nexhausted by their strenuous endeav\nors of the last fortnight.\nOnly to the initiated is the news of\nthe reverse positively known at this\ntime. Emperor Nicholas and high\nmilitary officers of course were -in\nformed by Gen. Kuropatkin\'s tele\ngram of Tuesday stating tersely that\nMukden mnust be adandoned and they\nreceived details of the withdrawal as\nthey appeared in excised positions of\nthe official dispatches given out yes\nterday. Last evening a newspaper\ncontained a vague report of doubtful\norigin credited to Chinese sources\nbut the first positive statement was\nderived from the Associated Press\ndispatch from Gen. Kuroki\'s head\nquarters, the contents of wvhich was\nquickly telegraphed to many liberals\nfrom friends abroad. The report\nprobably will not be printed in this\nmorning\'; papers, the government,\ntrue to its policy of breaking bad\nnews gently, only preparing the way\nby authorizing the publication of a\nnumber of premonitory telegrams.\nThe news, however, is only what was\nexpected, ultimate retirement having\nbeen discounted from the moment\nOyama inaugurated his brilliant\nmove westward.\nAnticipated Retirement.\nFrom information in the possession\nof the Associated Press it is known\nretirei ient before the beginning of\nthe b),ttle, and that he had hoped to\naccomplish it without a serious com\nl.t. The Japanese. however. forced\nhim to accept battle. The (ouble\nturning movement compelled him to\nsend the maior part of his reserves to\nthe fighting line and rendering an cf\ntective counterstroke )it of the qties\ntin. and the decision to retire was\nimmediately taken on March 6. as\nwas stated by the Associated Press\non that day. Withdrawal was actual\nly begun during the night. The great\nquestion now, and over which the\ngeneral staff burned its lights late in\nto the night, is whether Field Mar\nsh] Oyama has entangled the Rus\nsians in his strategic net sufficiently\nto prevent a successful retreat to Tie\npass.\nGen. Rennenkamff\'s force to the\neastward admittedly is in great dan\nger of being cut off and a considera\nble force of Japanese appears to be\noperating on the Russian right well\ntoward Tie pass. If the Japanese\nsucceed in reaching the railroad and\ninterrupting traffic if only for a few\nhours it may have the greatest con\nsequences for Gen. Kuropatkin, who\nis now engaged in a race with the\nJapanese to reach the naturally de\nfensible position of 40 miles north\nward. Thus far he has stood off all\nattacks directly against the flanks of\nhis army and holds the way of retreat\nopen. He undoubtedly was forced to\nabandon a number of -siege guns on\nhis Shakhe position, but if he suc\nceeds in turning over the army intact,\nwvith the principal portion of its artil\nlerv train, to his successor the Rus\nsian case will be by no ficans des\nperate. for Oyama will again have\nmissed his quarry and a comparative\nly barren victory will have been pur\nchased at enormous cost of life.\nAll reports indicate that the Japa\nnese were utterly reckless of sacri\nfices, making attack after attack, and\nespecially on the centre and west\nward against machine guns and in\nfantry fire which literally mowed\ndown the advancing column, making\nhuman flesh so cheap that the survi\nvors could bastion themselves behind\npiles of corpses.\nAfter this action Gen. Kuropatkin\'s\ndeposition may be regarded as cer\ntain. War Minister Sakharoff is pick\ned as his probable successor, though\nDrand Duke Nicholas Nicholaevitch\nor a board of strategists may be en\ntrusted with the direction of affairs.\nA strong faction of the army, those\nhigh in influence about the emperor.\nopposed Gen. Kuropatkin from the\nfirst, and though his early defeats\nwere condoned because it was realiz\ned that Gen. Kuropatkin was doing\nall that man could do wvith the tools\nat his command, it is now felt that\nafter twice having had the opportuni\nty to showv what he could do with a\npowerful army, and having failed to\naccomplish victory either time, his\nremoval is advisable.\nA high military official said last\nnight that the emperor had had\nenough of a general whose interpre\ntation of a victory was a successful\nretreat.\nCasualties Exceed roo,ooo.\nTokio. March g, 6 a. m.--The.great\nbattle in Manchuria raged all day yes\nterday along the entire enormous\nfront. The Japanese were generally\nvictorious, and they drove the Rus\nsians from a series of important po\nsitions. By nightfall it seemed im\nperative that Gen. Kuropatkin would\nhave to withdrawv his shattered le\ngions and avoid a complete disaster.\nIndeed, it appeared impossible for\nhim to effect a retreat without heavy\nloss of prisoners, guns and stores.\nThe continuous battle is already the\nbloodiest of the war. Upon the ground\nthat Gen. Oku alone gained lie 8,ooo\nRussian dead. The reports from the\nother armies are expected to triple\nthis figure. It is estimated that the\nJapesoe have lost 50,000, making the\nIlaughter far exceed Ioo,ooo\nm . Details of the combat are lack\nhi. it is believcd that the Japa\nnese cu,it the railway north of Mukden\nicaving only the roadways and a light\nraiway frni Fushun to Tic pass as\navenues for the retreat of the Rus\nsans. but, army headquarters refrain\nfroin aftirming or denying a report to\nthat effect. It is thught that Mukden\nis still in the hands of the Russians.\nWAREHOUSES FOR COTTON.\nMeeting of Warehouse Con ittee\nCotton Growers\' Associr\ntion.\nColumbia. March 9.-The ware\nhouse committee met in Columbia on\nTuesday and permanently organized\nby electing E. W. Robertson chair\nman and Mr. F. H. Weston secretary.\nAn insurance expert in the person\nof Mr. E. G. Seibels and a represen\ntative of Architect C. C. Wilson\'s of\nfice were called in to give estimates\nas to the insurance rates and the cost\nof erecting warehouses throughout\nthe state.\nMr. Seibels said that by special ar\nrangements a rate of one-fourth of\none per cent. might be obtained on\ncotton stored in well protected ware\nhouses. Of course the warehouses\nwould have to be protected with\nsprinklers and be of the most approv\ned style.\nThe architect said that these ware\nhouses could be built 40 by ioo feet,\nwith gravel roof and best pattern for\n$i.200. the sprinkler system to cost\nabout 25 per cent. more. Such a house\nwould have a capacity of i,ooo bales.\nA oo-bale capacity warehouse could\nbe built for $Soo. If storage for any\nmore than i,ooo bales is required sep\narate warehouses should be built.\nThe resolution by Mr. Burnett was\nadopted:\n"That it is the sense of this com\nmittee that we recommend to every\ncommunity in South Carolina, where\nthe necessity for ware houses exists,\nto build these ware houses through\ntheir own efforts or by outside assis\ntance if proffered, or if possible to\nattain then at a cost of from $80o to\n$1,200, with a storage capacity, re\nspectively of from 500 to i,ooo bales\nof cotton."\nMr. LeRoy Springs, of Lancaster,\nintroduced the following, which was\nadopted:\n"That we urge upon the farmers\nthe importance of storing their cot\nton promptly on being ginned in the\nstandard ware houses where they can\nget negotiable ware house receipts,\nthus saving it from loss in weight\nand damage and putting it in negoti\nable shape so that they will not be\nforced to market it except at their\nown pleasure, as it has been demon\nstrated by the action of the New Or\nleans convention that irrespective of\nthe size of the crop, by the judicious\nmarketing of the cotton, reasonable\nprices can be maintained, which can\nonly be accomplished by the effective\nware house system."\nOn motion of Mr. E. D. Smith this\nwas added to the resolution:\n"Any information as to construc\ntion or outside assistance can be ob\ntained by communicating with the\nColumbia office of the Southern Cot\nton association.\nResolved.

This\nleaves to juries the right to fix dam\nag .. For comiplaints on account of\nthe co-(1uct of dispensary constables.\nThe Wieters case from Charleston\nis generally known of and the su\npreme court decided that all of the\nbonds of the dispensary constables\nare liable in the pending suits. The\nsuits were brought by Mr. J. P. K.\nBryan, of Charleston, and he has thus\nfar won in his contention that the\nbondsmen were liable.\nThe opinion in the case was ren\ndered by Associate Justice Ira B.\nJones. There were t1hree separate\ncases, all of which were decided in\nthe one opinion. The action in each\ncase was against one of the state dis\npensary constables. The circuit court\nrefused the motion \'a each case to\nstrike out certain portions of the\ncomplaint, and an appeal was taken\nby the constables interested, through\ntheir attorneys.\nThe paragraph in the complaint to\nwhich exception was taken by the\ncounsel for the defendents recited\ntha: May was under bond for $500 for\nthe faithful performance of his duty\nas a constable and that on the night\nof August 22, 1903, he committed a\nbreach of the said bond by violently\nassaulting Wieters. The constables\nmoved to trike out all reference to\nthe bond as irrelevant, on the ground\nthat the bond was not liable for the\ndamages resulting from the assault.\nThe circuit judge refused on the\nground that the bond was liable for\ndamages. occasioned by the acts of\nthe constable, where he exceeded his\nlawful authority. This is affirmed by\nthe supreme court. The court says:\n"If an officer, a state constable, while\nattempting to exercise some duty of\nhis office, abuses or exceeds his au\nthority or executes it in an unlawful\nmanner to the injury of another, his\nbond is liable. To illustrate: If a\nstate constable, in an attempt to dis\ncharge a duty of his office in the seiz\nire of contraband liquor or the ar\nrest of one openly violating the dis\npensary law, should, without just ex\ncuse, commit an assault and battery,\nor. if in overcoming resistance he\nshould so exceed .his duty as to be\ncome the aggressor in an assault and\nbattery to the injury of another then\nthere is liability on his bond. But an\nassault and battery, committed by a\nconstable under a bold assumption\nand usurpation of authority, without\nprocess and authority of any kind,\nwould not be covered by the terms of\nhis bond."\nElliott Dexter, the leading man\nwith Miss Florence Davis in "The\nPlayer Maid," is one of the handsom\nest young leading men on the stage,\nand has the face and figure generally\nconsidered characteristic of a matinee\nidol.

"Yet the\nRoosevelt partisians will claim.\'\' says\nthe Post. "that the president has, by\nthe new appointment. answvered all\ncriticisms that have been made of his\ncourse in the Crum case." The peo\nple of Charleston. w~ho ob.iect to noth\ning so much as Crum in the ofhce of\ncollector, have the sympathy of the\nsouth in the burden which has been\nforced upon them by the president.

This is true. Certainly\nwhatever helps the south should have\nthe support of the south.

On Sunday afternoon Melloy\nmet the youths in a resort in the\nheart of the city. Talk turned to his\nwoderful performances in eating.\nand Melloy boasted he could eat 85\npounds of beef in twenty -hours. One\nof the voting men in the party then\noffered to bet Melloy $roo that he\ncould not eat the amourit. Melloy\nhesitated in accepting the bet, and\nwas laughed at for a "quitter." He\nwas called "fakir" and "four-flusher,"\nand was told that any one in the par\nt could equal him at eating when at\nhis best.\nUnable to bear the derision. Mel\nvy finally said he would make the\nbet. The money was staked and\nfresh beef was obtained from a pack\ning h\' use.

Teetor is the su\nperintendent of a car building com\n)ay at Hlagerstown, Ind. He has a\nitte son named Lothair, eight years\nold. The father had agreed to bring\nthe son to the inauguration and the\n)o felt that he would like to bring\nsomething along to Quentin, the sev\nen-year-old son of the president. The\nfather suggested a fine top and pro\nceeded to plan one. He ttunred the\nplans over to the little son, who began\nwvork upon the bronze and steel his\nfather had given him. With the help\nf the workmen he soon turned out\nthe finest top even given to the son\nof a president or to any other boy.\nOne night the little fellow worked\nuntil nearly midnight at the iathes,\nani the other hours were put in be\nfore and after school and on Satur\ndays. WVhen completed the mechan\nsm was so delicately adjusted and\nthe friction so little that the top, with\na li:tle pulling from a string, would\nrun 20 minutes.

Be\n;ore the War Between the Sec:ions\n1e was elected district judge in Tex\na1. He went to the United States\nsenate in 1887. After retiring from\nthe senate Judge Reagan was ap\npoin:ed chairman of the state rail\nroad commission. but from this he\nresigned a few years ago. At the\ntime of his death he was engaged in\nwriting his autobiography.\nHe was a native of Tennessee, -hav\ning been born in Sevier county in\nisis, 87 years ago. He earned the\nmoney to educate himself,\nworkin at all sorts of man\nual labor and running boat\non the Tennessee river. In 1839\nhe went to Texas and early took part\nin the fights to drive the Cherokees\nout of that country. Gen. Albert\nSidney Johnson made him a scout\nand he cculd have had a commission\nas lieutenant but declined, preferring\nto take up his work as surveyor. His\nwork kept him in constant danger\nfrom the Indians. who were given to\nmassacring surveying parties.\nHe studied law and was admitted\nto practice in 1848. He had already\nbeen elected a colonel of militia and\nwas made probate judge of Hender\nson county in 1846. The next year\nhe was sent to the legislature, and\nbecame chairman of the committee\non public lands. In 1849 he was de\nfeated for t\'he state senate but later\nwas elected district judge. It was\nin this office that he made the record\nthat brought him prominence and es\ntablished his reputation for the fear\nless discharge of official duty. At\nthat time the country over which his\njurisdiction extended was full of\ngamblers and desperadoes, men of\nreckless spirits and daring characters.\nHe enforced the law with a heavy\nhand and his life was constantly in\ndanger, but the moral and physical\ncourage of John H. -Reagan were not\nfor a moment to be doubted and his\ncourt became respected and feared.\nIn 1836 Judge Reagan-he has\never since been called "\'judge"s in\nTexas--was elected to congress as a\ndemocrat and he was a member of\nthat body until 1861, when he wvent\nhome to take a seat in the conven\ntion called for the purpose of consid\n-rinlg secession. ,He voted for the\nsecession of Texas.

This action brought him in\nto considerable unpopularity wvith t-he\nTexans. who had not recovered from\nthe passions of the wartime, but it is\nsignificant that nearly all the Con\nfederate states now have constiaitions\nsimilar in effect to the regulations\nwhich Judge Reagan theni recom\nmended. it was for nine years that\nJudge Reagan was laid on the politi\ncaiel on account of this an3.nosity.\nbut in 1874 he was again elected to\nthe United States congress by a ma\nJirity of 4.000. and two years later\nthis majori:y was increased to 8,.ooo\nwhile :n 1878 his reelection was prac\ntically without opposition.

Chadwick brought the\nfirst day of her trial in Cleveland.\nOhio. to an abrupt cb,se on Monday\nafternoon.\nThe trial made ral)id progres on\nManday. The jury was accepted\nwithin t\\wo hours. and in the after\nnoo\'n the opposing counsel outlined\ntheir cases. and the taking of testi\nnony was commenced.\nShorn of its legal phraseology, t-he\ncharge on which Mrs. Chadwick is\narraigned is conspiracy against the\nlaws of the United States-the con\nspiracy as defined by the government,\nresting on the agreement between\nher and t-he officials of the Citizens\'\nNational bank of Obelin, Ohio, to is\nsue and negotiate certified checks\nwhen she had no money in the bank.\n"The evidence to be submitted in\nthe case," said Attorney Sullivan in\nhis _pening statement. "will show\nthat Mrs. Chadwick was associated\nwith Spear and Beckwith, the officials\nof the Citizens\' National bank of\nOberlin, Ohio. in business. They had\nmany transactions together, in the\ncourse of which eight different\nchecks amounting in all to $67,000,\nwere certified by Spear and Beckwith.\nThe evidence will show that when\nthese checks were certified no money\nwas in the bank in the name of Mrs.\nChadwick and no entries to her credit\nwere on the books of the bank."\nMr. Dawley for Mrs. Chadwick\nsaid:\n"We expect thlat the evidence wvill\nfail to show that there was any con\nspiracy between Spear. Beckwith and\nthe defendant. What Beckwith did,\nle did as the president of the bank,\nand without fradulent connivance\nwithl Mrs. Chadwick. What Spear did\nwas under the direction of Beckwith.\nand was done by him in good faith.\nHe believed that Mrs. Chadwick was\nwealthy, was worthy of credit to the\nanount of certified checks, and be\nlieving this, and acting in good faith\nas he did, he could not have been\nguilty of conspiracy, which by its\nvery nature implies criminal intent.\nBeckwith and Spear did not conspire\nbecause they acted in good faith and\nas they did not conspire, it was not\npossible for Mrs. Chadwick to con\nspire with them."\nTuesday\'s Proceedings.\nNine witnesses were examined in\nthe Chadwick trial on Tuesday and\nthe defense established the fact that\nthe claim of the government that\nMrs. Chadwick had no money in the\nOerlin bank at the time of draw\ning chlecks wvhich were certified by\nSpear and Beckwvith, was inlc )rrect in\ntwo instances at least.\nIt was shown by the general jour\nnal ni tihe hank that on Nov. 3. 1903.\nwhen Mrs. Chadwick received a cer\ntiiedl check for S1o.ooo, an entry\ncrediting 1her with that amount was\nmadec on the journal of the bank and\na deposit slip for $10.ooo was madec\nout in her name.

Another entry of sinmilar\nnature amnountinlg to $3,0oo was also\nf ound.\nMrs. Chadwick came into court ap\nparently none the worse for hecr ill\nness, which caused the adjournment\nMonday.\nIt is doubtful if Andre.v Carnlegie\n~il1 take the stand.

"Mere Mant\nhoody for the Lawyer." was presented\nin a style that held the attention of\nall present throughout the entire lec\nture.

And\nbesides this, the lawyer should \'e\nhonest in all his dealings with his\ncliert. Nor should the lawyer at\ntemt to mislead a judge on a point\nf l.w, nor a jury on a point of fact.\n"In a sense the lawyer is supposed\no be, and he is, the guardian of the\nrights of the people. He ought to be\nsomething more than a learned advo\ncate. He is first of all a citizen, and\nhe should contribute to the best in\nterests of the state. And above all\nother. he should stand firm by one\nthing. namely. that just principle of\nonduct shall control in everything\nthat he does."\nIn strong terms, the lecturer up\neld the maintenar ce of principle, of\ncharacter and of manhood. The high\nest type of the learned lawyer and\ncultured gentleman was presented,\nD)r. Cromer desiring that everyone\nfresnt might reach that height.\nIn conclusion, the lecturer desired\nto impress two things: First, the\nreeting of all obligations and en\ngageets promptly; second, that\neveryone before him might effectuate\na blameless. clean and honorable\nmanhood for the lawyers of ouir coun\n1:ry, and as far as it goes, for our\nPARR SHOALS POWER.\nNumber of Contracts Placed-Work\nof Development to Begin in\nthe Near Future.\nMr. \\\\.
