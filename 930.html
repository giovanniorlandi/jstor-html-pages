The\ncrowd did the splendid bsrbeeuc be\nfore awaiting for the speakers to\nturn up. Only one was there, Capt.\nJohn A.

Webb was introduced to the\nmembers and audience. Capt. Webb\nstressed the first requisite to\nwas co-operation. That\nSID\'\nwe are near\ner to markets than Florida. Texas\nand Louisiana, and that was due to\nthe railroad haul. In cabbages after\nthe Florida, Texi;* and Louisiana\ncrops are gone we have it to oursel\nves. Tho\' on account of the bulk,\nshould be grown near transportation\nlines or brought in by trucks to the\ndars, Mississippi has the greatAit\ntomato growing section in the world\nat Crystal Springs, and inspection of\nthe packs had much to do in achiev\ning this reputation. This is the spec\niality crop of Mississippi. Sweet po\ntato harvesting lis more important\nthan any other item m promoting the\nsuccess of the grower—his handling\nhas much to do with prices.

Eight\ncases have come to light in the\nlast ten days, the latest taking\nplace this afternoon at Lufkin,\nwhere Sherwood Vinson was seiz\ned ct the ilepyt by four masked\nwhilked away in a motor\ncar. Forty minutez later he wai\nreturned and dumped out into the\nstreet of the business section with\na coat of tar and feathers cover\ning his body.lt was the second at\ntack there within the last eigh\nteen hours, Ben Wiley, thirty\nyears old, having been taken from\ntowfi hist night and later dumped\ninto a street as theater patrons\nwere passing, homeward bound.\nNo prosecutions of alleged\nmembers of the masked parties\nhave taken place except at Waco,\nwhere a tar party episode reetdt\n1 cd in the arrest of four men.\nThree have been bound over by\nthe grand Jury on charges of\nwhitecapping and the fourth re\nleased.\nto appear\nEvery state should have a law for\nbidding disguise of any kind. Such •\nlaw would do much toward preventing\nmob law.\nLaws must be enfosced by legally\nconstituted bodies. Just at soon as\nmobs undertake such enforcement (ha\nlaws of the country are brought into\ncontempt and the innocent suffer.\nThere is no excuse at this time fot\nthe Ku Klux or any other self-con\nstituted law-enforcing mob. If the\nsame effort was exerted by so-called\nregulators to assist the courts in fer\nreting out crime as ta used to carry\nout their own mandates, crime of all\nkinds would soon decrease. Unfortun\nately, the very men who form such\nmobs are the ones who do all in their\npower to prevent legal enforcement.\nThere are men in every community\nwho profess to ba good citizens whose\ninfluence is invariably with the crimi\nnal, but thes* same men are quick to\njoin a mob to tar and feather or hang\n•ome fellow who Is suppoesd to be\nguilty of an offense without giving\nhim the benefit of a trial.\nEXAGGERATED REPORTS.\nWashington, July 26.—Alarm\ned at reports of a threatened\n"semi-famine" coupled with an\nepidemic of\n£ section of the\nPresident Harding today request\ned both the public health service\nand the American Red Croat to\nmake immediate investigation\nand report what could be done\nby the federal government to re\nlieve the situation.\nThe fullest co-operation of all\nfederal agencies In the relief\nmeasure was promised by the\npresident who declared that if\nfound necessary, congress would\nbe asked to pass special legisla\ntion. He urged that no time be\nlost in ascertaining the actual\nconditions and applying to them\nan effective remedy.\nThe threat of "famine and\nplug je" the president wrote to\nthe health service and the Red\n1\'io-r, seemed to ariae from the\nfac t that depressed markets had\nmade it impossible for the people\nof a large section of the south\nto -ell their stocks of cotton. The\nr -tilting shortage of money, ho\ni»id, apparently had deprived\nmany thousand* of the variety of\nfood necessary to ward off pella\ngra.—Press Dispatch.\nWe believe these reports are gross\nly exaggerated. This is the first in\ntimation appearing in the dispatches\nregarding -this 4>-called "calamity"\nwhich is about to befall the south.\nWe arc inclined to the belief that\nthis call for help is fostered by a\nétriM\npellagra in a large\nsouth, rn cotton belt,\nI\nthe part of those who have\nheld cotton to gat the government to\ntake over much of the damaged crop\nof two years ago.\nIf pellagra is on the increase in\nthe south, tha increase is in other\nstates than Mississippi. This state\nhas shown a steady decrease In this\ndisease for the past several years, if\nreports from the State Board of\nHealth are to be relied upon. Besides,\nif there be an increase in this dis\nease, the trouble lies In ignorance\nrather than in poverty. Few people\nhave yet learned how and what to\neat. If we need anything K ii a\ncampaign of education. We under\nstand thet dentists declare that pel\nlagra is responsible for the spread\nof Rigg\'s disease.\na\nj\nMALE CANDIDATES GET\nCOLD FEET\nJackson, Miss., July 21.—Miss\nBelie Kearney, of Madison county,\nformally opened her campaign for\nthe United States Renate in suc\n\'cKsitMi to Senator John Sharp\nWilliams, who has refused to\n•anti for re-election, in a speech\ndelivered at Utica, this county to\n■\'■\'l\n■ ormcr Senator James K.

Bilbo\nmt pwd to w*ttw *tt«n!\nMins Kearney contented her*\nself with the mere arniounccranet\nof her c andidacy and the predic\ntion that Mteiissippl would be the\nfirst state in the union to aend a\n\' woman to the senate and discuss\ned other matters during the re\nmainder of her speech at the\nshe received an\novation, many gathering about\nher to assure her of their support.\nIt\'s pretty early in the rnce for the\nmale part of the senatorial race to\nget cold feet Vardaman may have\nlingering recollections\' of n Joint de\nbate which took place near Merldinn\nonce upon a time; while Bilbo has not\nforgotten, no doubt, that women have\nbeen his undoing.\nThere are those, the Hcveille editor\namong the number, who are itching\nto hear a three-cornered joint debate\nbetween these aspirants. They are all\npertty good at stump speaking, and\nwhere the listener has but little inter\nMiss. |\n;\nPort\nmail\nclose of which\n•at in either of the trio, we imagine\nthere would be real fun—far superior\nto the prize fight recently pulled off—\nshould such • debat« be staged.\nLIKE THE KING OF FRANCE\nThe Ixisrd of mayor and aldermen\nof Port Gibson has taken the course\nof the King of France who marched up\nthe King of France who marched up\nthe hill with a thousand men. A com\nmittee «vas sent from the board of\naldermen to the board of supervisors\nasking that a compulsory vaccinatifin\norder for Port Gibson be passed. The\nsupervisors passed the order, and\nCounty Health Officer Chapman im\nmediately set a date upon which the\nnegroes of the town should be vaccin\nated. They obeyed the order, and\nmore than seven hundred colored peo\nple were vaccinated. Dr. Chapman\nthen fixed a date for the whites. Com\nparatively few obeyed, and another\ndate was fixed with the published\nwarning that legal steps would be tak\nen to enforce the order if it was not\nobeyed. Opposition immediately de\nveloped, and the hoard of aldermen\nmet in special session and asked the\nboard of supervisors to rescind the\norder, President Guthrie called the\nboard to meet Wednesday, two days\nafter the last date act by the county\nhealth officer for vaccinating.\nMost of the whites vaccinated went\nto the offlcea of the local physicians\nor had them go to their homes rather\nthan go to the court house. In doing\nthis, they incurred expense, but they\nobeyed the law.\nThe Reveille was really not in fav\nof of a compulsory vaccination order,\nbut it did not feel inclined to oppose\nit, realizing such a course would make\nIt more difficult for the officers to\nenforce the law should such an order\nbe passed; and after it had been pass\ned, the paper has done its best to get\nall to obey it.\nWe feel that the board has not\ndealt fairly with the law-abiding cit\nizens of the town by asking thet the\norder be rescinded after they had paid\nthe expense and suffered the incon\nvenience incident to vaccination.\nThere is no justice in any law that\ngoverns only the law-abiding, and\nthis element resents this attitude of\nthe board.\n•\nas\n(ha\nfot\nthe\nall\nto\nbe\nPREACHER VS. SHERIFF\nCasey Jones, sentenced to hang for\nthe murder of a woman and incarcer\nated in the Hattiesburg jail to await\nthe result of an appeal to the s»\npreme court, was taken out by a band\nof about 75 other\nSaturday morning and lynched.\nAn ordinary lynching bee is of only\npassing notice now; but thi swas an\nextraordinary case, in that a mob had\nattempted to lynch Jones a few weeks\nago, but was put to rout by a preach\nurderers early\ner.\nThe preacher, at the head of a hos\npital where Jonee was recuperating\nfrom a gunshot wound inflicted by the\nwoman\'s husband, was not expecting\nmob violence, and was not under oath\nto protect hie patient, yet he hurriedly\narmed himself and atppd off the\ncrowd. The Phetiff was expecting the\nmob, had two deputies with him, but 1\napparently made no effort to save the\nlife of the man he was sworn to pro\ntect. The difference is altogether in\nthe men. One had a console««# and\nrespect for law; the other seems to\nhave neither regard for law nor the\noath he had taken when he became\nan officer. If he was not in sympathy\nwith the Work of the mob he is a cow\nard.\nThe falling off in the assessed val\nues of property in the county, as wit!\nI* seen by reference to the figures\npublished elsewhere, is indeed dis\nheartening; yet, a large decrease was\n., . -, h\n, W " known\nthat the item of cattle alone must\nshow a total decrease of about »100,\n000, since there had been such a slump\n; "■ - ****** - «•\nWhen tha assessment was taken in\n1920 the price of this live stock was\nhigh and the assessment was made on\na basis of an average of »25 per head;\nj this year, on a basis of about lib.\nThe Reveille announced two week*\nago that there vquld he a decree\nterm ,200.000 to »300.000, but we Were\nunprepared for such a big decrease,\n\'V th «is old assessed values and\nhigh tax levy the county is unable to\nmeet its obligations; with thi. up- j\npreaching decrease in income there 1\nmust by necessity be far greater dif\nWe are in sympathy wifi) pie pro\nposed law to make a sheriff respon\nsible for damages to the family of a\nlynchai man for failure to protect\nhim after the prisoner ha* been plac\ned in his care.\nDECREASED ASSESSMENTS\nticfclty experienced by the board of\nthe\nto\nde\nnot\nall\n■■■■\nchance of much of an increase in the ;\nlevy: first, because we have about !\nreached our limit; second, because the\naverage man is taxed about all he can\nstand.\nsupervisors in taking care of the coun- 1\nty*s affairs.\nWe understand that there is no j\nREVIVAL OF BUSINESS\nThere appears to be a revival of\nbusiness all over the country. Even\nhere in Claiborne county some lines\nof.business have felt the improvement,\ndespite the fact that there has been no\nharvest, save the small trucking.\nThere has not been a proper adjust\nment, to be sure, and cannot be in so\nshort a time; but this adjustment is\nslowly taking place, and economical\nhabits are being formed by those who\nhad developed profitably during the\ninflated prices and profiteering days\nof a year ago.\nWe may reasonably expect within\nthe next few months, the whole coun\ntry to be on a better financial basis\nthan at any time since the United\nStates entered the war. The profi\nteer and the »10-u-day common labor\nwill not be, of course. They had their\nday while the masses Buffered; but\nthe rank and file of the people; those\nwho supply the money to keep the\nwheels of progress turning; will prob\nably enjoy a greater degree of nor\nmalacy than for the past four years.\nThese are the people who really con\nstitute the country; they are the ele\nment which constitutes the balance\nwheel, and when they begin to feel a\nfinancial stimulous the country is get\nting back to normal.\nup\nof\nCREDIT DANGEROUS\nMuch is being written by the south\nern press regarding the statement\nfrom Washington that ample credit\nwill be given the southern farmer to\nmarket his cotton. We wonder if\ncredit has not, in large measure, been\nthe south\'s undoing. Some credit, to\nbe sure, is vitally important; too\nmuch credit is dangerous.\nThe man who seeks credit solely for\nthe purpose of giving him time to\nmake his own way is wise, but he who\nseeks credit for the purpose of hold\ning crops for hoped-for better prices\nis treading upon dangerous ground.\nWhere one man profits by borrowing\nmoney for the latter purpose, dozens\nsuffer. It is unwise to hold a product\neven when one has sufficient money\nto stand any loss that might be sus\ntained; but hazardous indeed to do so\non borrowed capital.\nAny observer knows this is true.\n!To has witnessed the downfall of\nmany otherwise gn.v! business men be\ncause of this uindiie. Let us not\nbe too ready to borrow; borrowing\nonly for the purpose of growing and\nharvesting; not for gambling;\nis\nnt\nm\nin\nto\nis\nLONG SHOT AT PROSPERITY\nRepresentative Fordney, whose pro\ntective tariff bill which is designed to\nraise »6000,000,000 has just been pass\ned by Congress, claims that the adop\ntion of the measure wi|l bring pros\nperity.\nJust how this wise law-maker can\nreach such a conclusion is past finding\nout. To be sure, the few who bene\nfit by tha protection offered will pros\nper, but how about the great masses\nof consumers who have to pay more\nfor the necessties of life 7 And these\nmasses constitute by far the greater\npart of Hie country\'s population.

It\nis now being operated 22 hours per\nday, and the monthly receipts are\nfrom »200 to 300 above the operating\nexpenses. It is true that nothing is\nbeing charged off for interest on the\nbonded indebted less, but at the same\ntime the plant is not being given, cred\nit for the street lights and fire plugs\nwhich would about balance the inter\nest account.\nThe money which the plant has\nbeen making up to this time has been\nspent in replacements and some ex\ntensions, but Supt. McClure tells us\nthat this work has about been com\npleted, and from this time on there \'\nwill be a fund for the retirement of i\ndebts.\nThe plant is in magnificent condition, j\neverything being kept clean and at- |\ntractive as well as in fine working or\nder; and the service is excellent. At j\npresent about eighty tons of coal is |\nbeing consumed, while with the make i\nshift of a plant which was used while j\nthe present machinery was being in- :\nstalled took twice that amount run\nning spasmonieally about eight hours\nper day.\nWe think that both the board and\nSupt.

We havg been unfortunate\nin the men w» have had, from Alford\nto Kirby. They have not taken with\nthe farmers, especially the little far\nmers, who need assistance In the\nmarketing of their diversified crops.\nThe unpopularity of the county agent\nis due to the fact that our rural pop\nulation fight shy of strangers or new\ncomers that show them how to culti\nvate, harvest and sell agricultural\nproducts.

In the summer of 1895 Epiphany\n! church near Carlisle on the Port Gib\nson and Gallatin Road was taken\ndown rafter by rafter, weather board\nby weather board, and sill by sill and\nj removed to Hermanville to be\n! erected on a site purchased by the 1\nI vestrymen. A. McC. Byrnes and;\ni lhomas M. Hughes, great grandson\n! and grandson of the original donors\nj of the church superintended the re\nI movai. Epiphany was the second\nj oldest rural Episcopal parish in Mis\nsissippi. It contributed to the relig\n; 10US uplift of the planters and their\nslaves before the civil war and after\nto their descendants unto the fourth\ngeneration. The parsonage by its\nside harbored saintly men that pray\ned with them and preached to them\nthe word of God and His son, Jesus\nChrist.. Back of the church was the\ncountry graveyard with their white\ncrosses telling the birth, life and\ndeath of those gone before to Para\ndise. Its grounds was the sicial,\nschool and religious center for the\nmembers of the congregation and\ntheir neighbors.\nThe Fourth of July was regularly\ncelebrated on the grounds. I with a\nspeech recalling the patriotism of\nContinental days, and asking\nnewal of the pledges given by those\nheroic men then from their offsprings\nas well as newcomers to our shores\nto preserve the ideals of the reuublic\nfor all time. The most notable\nFourth of July speech was delivered\n1869 by Rev. John Gieplow, g Dan.\nish Episcopal clergyman, related to\nme by Capt. A. K. Jones, and there\nwas a great crowd present. Capt.\nJones said that only one person knew\nit word for word as it was delivered\nthat day, and that person was my\nfather. In 1912 I came in possession\nof a printed oogy of thgt oraHqn, und\nDr. Gierlowlg poem read at another\nFourth of July celebration "Land of\nFree and Land of the Braved!
