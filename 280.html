It was brought to Italy\nby the Romans In the time of the\nEmperor Claudius, was cultivated In\nEurope as early as 155(/ and brought\nto America about 1680. Its name Is\nderived from Persico, Its native coun\ntry. The ancients regarded it with\ndistrust, as according to Pliny they\nsupposed the king of Persia ond sent It\nInto Egypt to poison the Inhabitants\nwith whom he was at war. The Chi\nnese have traditions of a peach tree\nof knowledge and another of Immor\ntality. S\nWhere Happiness Is Found.\nSomebody says that happiness Is al\nways where we find It, but seldom\nwhere we look for It. This may bes\ngood epigram, but not good philoso\nphy for the farm. There we find hap\nplness where we look for It. —Ex-\nchange.\nHome Companionship.\nIf the boy Is not a companion to hU\nfather It Is generally because the fa\nther was not a companion to the boy\nwhen the boy was a little fellow. Com\npanionship is something which must\ngrow through the years, especially for\ntwo people who live under the same\nroof and share the same fortunes.\nMistakes Men Make\nIn Buying Tires\nPerhaps the greatest mistake\nis trusting to luck. For who\ncan tell when he looks at a tire\nwhether it will run 10,000 miles\nor fail at 1,000?\nTake the safe course as\nproved by thousands of others\ncome here for the Miller that\nis built by uniform workmen to\na championship standard. They\nare the only tires Geared- ta\nthe-Road. If you will try Mil\nlers once they will win you\nforever.\nby KING CO.\nStucco for Renovating House.\nMany men will “spruce up the old\nplace” when they will not tear down\nend rebuild. Sometimes It Is senti\nment, sometimes economy. Renova\ntion can do a lot more than Improve\nthe looks of the house. Remodeling\nand overcoating with stucco make the\nwalls fire-resistant —lowering Insur\nance premiums and Increasing safety.\nIt mal es the home easier to heat In\nwinter, cooler In summer, and often\nlowers the cost of repairing or repaint\ning- i\n| £\nTelltale Eyes and Toes.\nThe eyes tell the story of guilt when\nall the other muscles are controlled,\nthis you will learn In the eleventh\nchapter of Darwin\'s bo k.\nwhen the face Is coni led, as in th<\ncase of natives of India, other muscle!\nare uncontrollable. Sir Henry Maim\ndeclares that In India the judge car\ntell when a native Is lying by watch\ning his toes. He keeps his face pep\nfeetly straight and his eyes expre*\nslonless, but his toes begin to wlggU\nas soon as he begins to lie. \'\n■in ■! \'* ■ ■ 1 1 ■■ 1 **\nLooking Ahead.\nJunior, with his playmate, had been\ngiven some candy by an old gentle\nman, and on being asked bow they\nliked It replied: “Just fine!

C. it was Introduced\nInto Italy from Persia. Russia is the\nthief source of Circassian walnut. The\nlogs are so heavy that they will not\nfloat, and are sold from the forest\nwith their bark on. Only the heart of\nthe wood is used, and it is the crooked,\nIrregular logs that possess the best\nfigured wood. Even very old trees\nrarely have a clear length of more than\nten feet.\nA College Education.\n• A story not new, but worth repeat\nlug, Is once again going the rounds in\nEngland. Two bootmakers, whose es\nestablishments faced each other in the\nvillage high street, were very distinct\nly rivals. One of them had a son at\ncollege and, In the first week of his va>\ncation, there appeared in the shr.p win\ndow the motto: “Mens Conscln Recto."\nHis rival over the way wfls for sorai\ntime a little nonplussed, but within a\nfew days he arose to the occasion and\nthere appeared In his window a card\nbearing the legend, “Men’s and Worn*\nen\'s Conscla Recti.” —Christian Monk\ntor.\nCedar Chests\nHand carved, brass trimmed, moth\nproof, a beautiful piece of furniture.\nSee them.\n~ Stoves and Heaters\nBig stock, quality and very\nreasonable in price.

The woman who lets\nsmall tilings worry her will be com\npletely undone the first time she meets\nwith a really big problem. It" is dis\nintegrating to your mental and nervous\ncondition, not to mention your phys\nical condition, to worry. You need not\nbe resigned to fate nor slip your\ntroubles off as the old friend duck’s\nback throws water. But you can meet\ntroubles with a wiy to conquer them\nor adjust them —and, after that, “they\nshould worry,” but not you.\nCross Children.\nDon’t be cross with children when\nthey are cross. If they are Irritable\nand pouty leave them alone to theli\nblues or try to divert their attention\nto some interesing book or game ol\ntoy. Get them outdoors to play or to\nwalk. Take them for a side. The cone\ntoon retort to crosu children Is in being\ncross yourself, but this only hurts tlfe\nChildren and makes them moody and\nlater despondents.—Exchange.\nPaths to Happiness.\nIt Is the roost beautiful truth li\nmorals that we have no such thlnj\nas a distinct or divided Interest fron\nour race. In their welfare Is ours, uni\nby choosing the broadest paths to ef\nfeet their happiness we choose tin\nsurest and the shortest to our own.-\nBulwer Lytton.\nNew Vegetable Wax From Ecuador.\nFrom prehistoric times the Indians\nof Ecuador have utilized a wax found\non certain species of tall palms for\nmaking candles, says the Scientific\nAmerican. This wax occurs on the\ntree trunks In granular form, each tree\nfurnishing about fifty pounds. The\ntrees grow In great numbers on the\nmountains along the coast. Samples\nof this wax were sent to France and\nGermany, from which countries favor\nable reports and an offer of 19.6 cents\na pound were received.\nDemanded Attention.\nIrene’s mother was 111, and symra\nthiziag visitors sat at her bedside! <l*\nreciting all their attention to the hi*\nvalid.
