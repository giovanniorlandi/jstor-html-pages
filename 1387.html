CXXXIV-iNo. 182., ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA, MONDAY, JUN E 3.1918., PRICE ONE CENT., APPEAL TO VIRGINIANS, Every One Urged to Purchase War, Savings and Thrift Stamps?Presi, dent Issues an Appeal to the Nation., Virginians are expected to respond, to the greyt June thrift drive in such, a way that^on June 28 there will be, none unenlisted in the vast volunteer, army of production and saving. To, this end President Wilson has issued, an appeal to the nat:on to invest \'at, once in Thrift Stamps and War Sav, ings Stamps., The President\'s appeal follows:, ? "This war is one of nations?not 0I", armies?and all of our one hundred, million people must be economically, ami industrially adjusted to war con, ditions if this nation is to play its, full part in the conflict. The problem, before us is not primarily a financial, problem but rather a problem of in, creased production of war essentials, and the saving of the materials and, the labor necessary for the support, and equipment of our Army and Navy., Thoughtless expenditure of money for, non-essentials usas up the labor of, men, the products of the farm, mines, and factories, and overburdens trans, portation, all of which must be used, to the utmost and at their best for, war purposes., "The great results which we seek, can be obtained only by the participa, tion of every member of the nation;,, young and old, in a national concert, ed thrift movement. I therefore urge \', that our people everywhere pledge, themselves, as suggested by the Sec, retary of the Treasury, to the practice, of thrift; to serve the Government to, their utmost in increasing production, in all fields necessary to the winning, of the war; to conserve food and, fuel and useful materials of every, kind; to devote their labor only to, the most necessary tasks; and to buy, only those things which are essential, to individual health and efficiency, and, that the people, as evidence of their, loyalty, invest all that they can save, La Liberty Bonds and* War Savings\', Stamps. The securities issued by the, Treasury Department are so many of, them within the reach of every one, that the door of opportunity in this, matter is wide open to all of us. To, practice thrift in peace times is a vir, tue and brings a great benefit to the, individual at a!! times; with the des, perate need of the civilized world to, day for materials and labor with, which to end the war, the practice of, individual thrift is a patriotic duty, and a necessity., "I appeal to all who now own either, Liberty Bonds or War Savings Stamps, to continue to practice economy \'and, thrift and to appeal to all who do not, own Government securities to do like, wise and purchase them to the ex, tent of their means. The man who, buys government securities transfers, the purchasing power oT his money to, the United-States government until, after this war, and to that same de, gree docs not ouy in competition with, ;he government., \'\'I earnestly appeal to every man,, woman and child to pledge themselves, on or before th"? ?Sth of June to save, constantly and to b\';v as regularly as, possible the securities of the govern, ment. and to do tiu? as far or possi, ble through membership in War Sav, ings Societies. The 28th of June ends, this special period of enlistment in, the great volunteer army of produc, tion and saving here at home. May, there be none unenlisted on that day., "(Signed) Woodrow Wilson.", Mr. Gardner L. Boothc, the director, for the city of Alexandria of War Sav, ings Stamps, stated in connection, with the above appeal of President, Wihrr that he had just learned that, ?-vcv one of the representatives of, t\'ti Metropolitan Life Insurance Com, pany in the South will devote one, third of their working time during the, i- onth of June to the service of the, Government in the sale of War Sav, ings and Thi*ift Stamps, and as this, company has a splendid lot of rep, v. renratives in Jhe city of Alexaridria, ho hopes that \'through their rfforts a, large number of sales may be made, hex?., Mr. Boothe further stated that it, was to be hoped that many other, fcusiniss institutions would promptly, follow the patriotic example of the, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, to .?.?d this city in reaching its quota, of 5400.000 between June 1 and T)o, cenrv\'er 31st., Premium offered for Ford car with, motor No. 1742990. 1 will pay a high, premium for the above car on account, of sentimental reasons.

Otherwise they will be made, to face the court and pay the penalty, for their unconcern., During the past rew weeks mcm, s of the police force have made an, ;ir isc-to-housc inspection of the city, A- is ever the case at the beginning, summer, they found much which, ? uld have been done left undone., Tr ; negligent were told that unsight, ?ubbish and anything savoring of a, sance must be eliminated at once,, ome difficulty has been experl, ? ed, however, by well-meaning peo, in obeying the orders of the police, d-.\'i artinent from-the congestion of, <"-\'ors which have poured into the, - over of night soil, but where it, been shown that occupiers of, scs have placed their orders, this, vidence they have done all they, in that direction., hose who, according to law, are, compelled to connect their premises, with sewers arc also experiencing dif, "ficulty, as the plumbers have many, orders on hand, but on account of the, scarcity of labor or help of any kind, they can move but slowly., GE1?IAN V\'S STRUGGLE, Why is it that the French nation, is calm and confident, although the, enemy is at the Maine? asks the, Washington Post, who also answers, the question., France. Great Britain, Italy and, America have taken Germany\'s meas, ure and know that the present strug, gles are evidence of weakness and not, of strength. The war is going, against Germany in matters of vast, and irresistible influence, far trans, cending in importance and effect anv, single battle that has ever been, fought. The trampling of the Ger, man hordes at the Ma mo strikes the, superficial mind as terribly menacing, to the allies. The unseen influences, that arc bearing Germany down to, death are not those that impress the, ear and eye., The end of the war is not near, in a, count of days or weeks, but it \'s, brought nearer by Germany\'s exer, tions, which work for her earlier de, feat., Germany is in the sere and yellow, leaf as a military power. This is the, carefully formed conviction of thor, oughly informed and impartially de, tached neutral military experts, co, inciding with the absolute knowledge, of .the allied governments., The military clique that is hurry, ing the Germqn empire to destruction, is now making the last throw of the, dice of war. The German armies must, either defeat France. Great Britain., Italy and the United States within ?., few weeks or the plunder gained in, four years of murderous operations, against small nations will be lost and, the German empire lost with it., Hohcnzollcm a?d Hapsburg go, down. They are already in the rapids., They struggle vigorously, but in that, enormous current, among those fring, ed and .tagged rocks, under the tem, pest of the world\'s wrath, thev cannot, survive., * BL0OD UPON" IIIS HANDS, ?Macbeth hath murdered sleep!, Macbeth shall sleep no more, ? if be .-account of a fata) shootmg af, ? :i-\'r? sbii\'tiBat ?, fray between two negroes at Gum, Springs, Fairfax-county, yesterday is, given elsewhere in The Gazette. Two, negroes became involved in a diffi, culty. According to usage among this, species of the genus homo, each car, ried a pistol. One shot at the other,, but the ball went wild. The man who, was being used as a target drew hin, pistol and shot and killed his ad, versary., Believing he had acted in self-de, fense, the slayer made his way to the, station house and delivered himself to, the police. As the day was closing, he begged earnestly that another man, be placed in the ceil with him, as he, could not endure the thought of be, ing left alone in the night time. His, request was granted and another ne, gro, charged with a misdemeanor, was, locked up with him., Shedding human blood is a crime for, which the slayer suffers as long as h?, lives. Whether the killing is an act, of self-defense or one of wilful mur, der, the consequences are the same., The blood will not out. It- becomes, luminous at night, when the con, science is more assertive than ever, and the sufferer is alone., The descendants of Cain, who slew, his brother in a religious dispute, are, always in the world. The blood of, Abel cried.from the ground, and he, became a fugitive upon the face of, the earth. It has ever been so., REFLECTION ON CONGRESSMEN., Some one has said that the hand, that is thrust into every hole will, somewhere find a snake to bite it., A Washington paper yesterday, printed with much display an allega, tion that many empty whisky bottles, had been found in and near rooms, occupied by Congressmen in the, House Office Building opposite the, Capitol. It was farther alleged that, the Congressmen who occupied the, rooms voted dry in recents contests, in the House., Another paper of the Capital City, prints today an article which implies, that the bottles were placed where, found either by a practical joker or, some malicious person. One cotem, porary asks: Who was the "wet" in, dividual that laboriously collected \'29, ancient and empty whisky bottles and, placed one each at the doors of 29, offices of Representatives in the House, Office Building where the janitor, couldn\'t heipt but stumble, over them ?, And who among the members of the, House, if they see fit to indulge in, alcoholic spirits, are fools enough to, advertise their failing at a time wher., prohibition is on us. everyone?, The 29 "dead soldiers" alleged to, have been collected by the janitor of, the House Office Building on his Sun, day rounds were placed purposely, it, seems, at the doors of Representatives, wh.? voted to keep the prohibition, rider in the 911,000,000 agricultural, appropriation bill., Rev. E. C. Dimviddie, leading pro, hibitionist, not only attributes this, pitiful joke to an abortive attempt to, discredit the work of the "dry" ele, ment in Congress for the nation as a, whole, but characterizes it as an at, tempt to forestall the attempts to, make Washington "bone dry.", Several Representatives announced, that they will demand an investiga, tion., The joke is too crude to be taken, seriously., Certain Representatives will today, bold an indication meeting. Mean, while a squad of Secret Service men, will scour Washington looking for, the person or persons who found time, hanging heavy on their hands and, took to collecting souvenirs., THE FLY PROBLEM, Screens should nave been placed in, windows several weeks ago. not only, for the comfort they impart to dwel, lers indoors, but to*- the sanitary ef, fect., The dawning of real summer weafh, or brings the fly problem more clear, ly to the front. Those who have thu-<, far failed to heed the repeated warn, ings of the state department of heaPh, should no longer nsk the health and, lives of their own families and +he, families of their neighbors by failing, to adopt adequate measures for the, sanitary disposition anc adequate pro, tection from flies and animals of al!, waste and filth., A few hours\' work and a few dol, lars dr. money will construct a sani, tary toilet which is fly-proof and cuts, out the large part of the danger of, infection. Such a structure should, of, course, be so located that it cannot!, possibly contaminate the water sup, ply of any family., The next step should be the effec, tive screening of the home so thaf, neither flies nor mosquitoes can enter., In homes properly screened there is, a marked less incidence of malaria,, tyhoid fever, "summer complaint,",, and other insect-borne diseases., Screes are far less expensive than, doctor\'s bills, and a general screen, ing campaign is urged by the state de, partment of hea\'th., STRIKES A.ND THE WAR, The railroad strike at Alexandria a, few days ago was a most unfortunate, circumstances, says the Richmond Vir, ginian. As every one knows, the tair, -roads are now in the hands o: the, government, ami a board on railroad, wages and working conditions has, been appointed. The duties of tin\'s, board are to hear all cases wherein, any group of employes may set forth, their complaint. Distinguished labor, leaders are members of this board,, ar.d the entire personnel has been re, garded as satisfactory to labor, throughout the country., The strikers were reminded by Di, rector General McAdoo that the gov., ernment cannot be coerced ^or intimi, dated by any of its employes, and, this seems to have been all that was, necessary to put an end to this ktrike., Our cotemporary says further: The, government of the United States, through the opinions of its highest, courts recognizes the right of men t~., form themselves into associations foi, their mutual protection against the sel, fish employer, and to carry out by mu, tual agreement, other than by vio, lence,, all such regulations as may, promote\'the ends of justice., But in time of war, when the gov, ernment has the power to conscript, the services of any man for any line, of work, it is inconceivable tuat any, body of employes should dare to or, ganize a \'walk out" while under the, employment of the military establish, ment of the country. If the condi, tions or the wages were unfair in the, minds of the employes, their recourse, was to the board appointed to adjust, thintrs., WARNS AGAINST FAKERS, Say Half Gospel Mission Workers Are, Frauds., Philadelphia, June 3. ihe Cnam, J ot Commerce yesterday , rssued a, ...mine to the public aeainst fake, G^pel Mission workers who are eo, i?g around the city colloctm# from, charitnhle and ra\'ig.ous people., warning says: t, .

GERMAN LIFE TIDE -EBBS - j, War Drain On Central Powers Worse |, Than One Allies., London. June J.?The drain of rr.an, power, t-he fall in the numbers of, birjLhs and the loss of th? populatior, through sickness and under-feeling is, felt more severely by the Central, rowers than by the peoples cf th;, Entente. Whereas, the annual gnbi, of population in Germany, in Aus, tria and in Hungary, has given place, to a serious loss. the peoples of th, Entente have suffered a very small di, minution in comparison., As the war goes on this grown;-.\', disparity in the losses of population, between the Central Powers and thr., peoples sighting them is likely to in, crease. If the war goer, on into r.c-u, year, the population of the German, empire, cn which reliance was place !, for the cniargment of Germany\'s pros- j, pcrity and industry and for repairing 1, the injury to fra.ic and commerce aft, er the war, will have lost 1(1 per cent, of the numbers and a still greater, proportion of its industrial strength., The German empire \\yhich in Juno., 1919, should have had 72,000.000 peo, ple, will have na more than hi,.700,COP, Germany as a whole will have .7 pc, cent less population than when the, war began. Of those that have been, killed, the greater number were men, in the prime of life and energy, whom, Germany could least spare. By death ;, in the battle zone the German empire, has lost at least J,000,000 men. The, birth rate has sunk to such a figure, that by next year the number of births, will have fallen short of what t.ho\\, would have boon had thor? been iw, war, by three and a third million u, children., In the same period the annual num, ber of deaths among the German civil, ian population has, owing to the, stress and anxiety of the war and, owing to sickness and disease, which, have been aggravated by hardships, and food troubles increased by one, million over the normal. Much of tht, mortality among children and amor g, the civilian population as a whole has, been caused by the way in which th -, food supply of Germany has been mis, managed i.n the interests uf the land, holders and of the farming class and, to the detriment of the poor. The, landholders and farmers have pros, pered while the poor in the towns, have gone short of bread and pota, toes., Ti e vitality of the peoples of Aus, tria and of Hungary has suffered ever, mere. This, perhaps, was to be ex, pected. The peoples of Austria wit";, be 11 per cent poorer in numbers nexf, yea" than if the war had never taken, place. They will be X nor cent l.nve, in numbers than they were in 191 b, \'Hungary will be a till worse off. It, will have a population 9 per cent lov, er than before the war and Id pc, cent lower than H there had been no, war.

Such is the, lesult of experiments made by Dr. E., C. L. Miller, professor of physiology, chemistry at the Medichl College of, Virginia, and Dr. Charles C. Haskell,, professor of pharmaeology at the, Medical College of Virginia., The glass was given to a number, of dogs, in varying doses and at, varying intervals. Dr. Haskel and Dr., Miller then took a number of cap, sules filled with glass crushed and, pounded in a mortar to the size of an, ordinary granulated sugar. No harm, ful results were noticed., The report of Drs. Miller and Has, kell says:, "If the glass is to harm any one it, must be eaten, so the first point was, to determine how much glass could, be placed in food and not detected, when eaten. If detected the food would, not be eaten, as pounded glass gives a, very unpleasant gritty feeling when, crushed between the teeth. To deter, mine this point we baked cakes con-\', taining definite amounts of glass and, then ate portions of them.?, Our pounded glass was made from, ordinary broken beakers and \'test, tubes by pounding them in a mortar, and passing the material through, sieves. It was about as coarse as, granulated sugar., From tests it appears that food con, taining pounded glass about as fine as, granulated sugar would be so unpleas, ant that no one would eat it unless, the glass were in very small amounts,, at least less than one-eighth of one, per cent. Hence we conclude that, there is no danger of people eating, any considerable amount of pounded, glass without knowing it.", WRECKS TWO U-BO \\TS, Both Were Near the French Coast, When Sighted by the Crew,., An Atlantic Port, June -T?The crew, of aft American ship arriving here, Saturday from the war zone reports, the destruction of two enemv pi.hme, r.<-es by an American destr.yor al, nv st within sight of France.
