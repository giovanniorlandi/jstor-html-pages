FRIDAY FEBRUARY 6. 1903-\nNUMBER 28\nli UlilC\nAn agent of the\' Cuban govern\nment is in New Orleans and will\nvisit Kansas City and other West\nern point, in search of mules for\nservice in the island republic.\nHon. J. C Kyle of Panola\ncounty, announces ,the reconsider\nation of his purpose to become a\ncandiate for Governor, and says\nthat he will not be in the race.\nThe Memphis Scimitar a few\nmonths ago rightly diagnosed Mr.\nRoosevelt, for which it was in some\nquarters roundly criticised, but a\nlittle time has proved the correct\nness of its joaitiou.\nThem is a stronir rumor that the\nSouthern ind \'Frisco roads have\nbeen merged. In that event Ab\nerdeen, West Point and Starkville\nwill have two competing lines,\nwhile Tupelo and Columbus are\nreduced to a single system.\nGeneral Nelson Miles is in Lon\ndon and was guest of the King and\nQueen of Kngland at dinner Sun\nday. Now Roosevelt and General\nCoibin and Secretary Root will\n"have it in" for the pestiferous\n(ieneral of the Army for good this\ntime. They hated him bad enough\nalready, but this late distinction\nwill uncork new bottles of concen\ntrated wrath.\nGeneral .lohn li. Gordon will be\npresented with a splendid blooded\nsaddle horse at the Veterans Re\nunion at New Orleans next May.\nThe gift is from F. M. Hill of Mc\nKinney Texas, who served under\nOjiantrell during the civil war, and\nH. S. Ellis of Caddo, Indian Ter\nritory, who was in General Bedford\nForrest\'s command. The horse\nwas selected ami purchased by\n,nem but in the same sense that\n\'there is glory enough for al\nwill be presented iu the name of\nthe Confederate veterans.\nCharges have been preferred\nagniiiNt ditttrict Jerome, of New\nYork, for not suppressing the sale\nof liquors aud pool selling by the\nbookmakers at Morris Park race\ntrack. Information and affidavits\nwere furnished the district attor\nney but he declined to act, and the\nmatter has been submitted to Gov\nernor Odell. Jerome is one of the\nbeneficiaries who sailed into office\nh year or two ago on the "reform"\nxombinatioii that defeated the\nTammany Hall organization and\nhas since proved the most corrupt\nof the two.\nThe resident drummers of West\nPoint and their traveling friends\nof the State, were tr dated to a royal\nbanquet Saturday night, by Hou.\nF. A. Critz, which is said to have\nbeen a magnificent affair. That is\na new canvassing dodge in Missis\nsippi but has proved effective in\nother quarters, and was much in\nvogue a few years ago by the lob\nbyists at the natioual capital. The\nbanquet has not betn pronounced\nan electioneering scheme and we\nmay he transcending the proprie\nties in alluding to it iu that sense,\nbut its effect in the campaign will\ndoubtless liecome apparent.\ni e i\nThe "peaceful blockade estab\nlished by Mr. Quay relative to the\nomnibus Statehood bill, is worry\ning the United States Senate very\nmuch. It has thus far blocked all\nother legislation, though unable to\nsecure its own passage, and will\nprobably be the cause of forcing an\nextra session of Congress. The\n"omnibus bill\' provides for the\nadmission of the territories of Ok\nlahoma, Arizona and New Mexico\ninto the Union as States, whereas\nthe opposition to the measure de\nmands the admission only of Ok\nlahoma aud the Indian Territory\ncombined into one State, to which\nthe people of both territories are\nstrenuously opposed. The Detao\nocratio Senators have thus far sup\nported Senator Quay\'s proposition.\nOn 11 in ate Coosh Car give rUf Id\nob minate, beeaase it kill Dm m\nwhtah tieklM tb bimou membra,\nin tb eoasb, and at th same time d\ntb phlegm, draw oat tb tafiammatioa\nand heel and soothe tb aCseted part.\nOn Ulaat Coagh Car streeOaea tb\nlea, ward off pneumonia aad is a haras\nlaa aad failing ear ia all eurttle\neaeee of eoajb, oolda aad) eroap.

It renders your\ncrop as easy again for\ncultivation\nThe director of coinage at Wash\nington has ordered that tweuty\neight employed of the New Orleans\nmint be indefinitely fu Houghed,\nwhich meant a permanent redac\ntion of the force. Thin is done in\norder to restore the working force\nto the Htfttua that prevailed prior\nto the enactment of the law requir\ning the coinage of 1,500,000 silver\ndollars monthly. Just before the\nassembling of the current session\nof Congress the New Orleans mint\nwas in imminent danger of perma\nnent suspension, but a compromise\nwas effected whereby a similar re\nduction is made at the Philadel\nphia mint, and both will continue\noperations.\nThe Merchants aud Farmers\nBank of Pontotoc earned a net\nprofit of fourteen per cent, in 1902.\nFrom that source 10 per cent, was\npaid to stockholders, two per cent,\nadded to surplus fund and per\ncent, to reduce the book value of\nfurniture and fixtures and banking\nhouse. The resources and liabili\nties of the bank are reported at\n$94,500.\nMr. J. W. Hudson, a merchant\nof Fulton, is a candidate for sheriff\nof Itawamba county. He will be\nremembered as a salesman in one\nof the Aberdeen wholesale grocery -houses\na few years ago.\' Since hiaj\nresidence in Aberdeen he has serv-\ned one term as sheriff of Itawamba.\nTh scratch of a pia aaa y eaaa tb lua\nof a limb or va death wbea blood poi\neonteg f Malta from th injury All dan\nger of thi may b avoided, however, by\npromptly applying Chamberlain\' Paio\nCalm.

It is quite probable,\nhowever, that he will enter the\ncontest in earnest four years hence,\nand will be a formidable com\npetitor if the record is maintained\nthat he has already earned as At-torney-Geuural.\nIt is very boubt\nful thai ho will have opposition for\nthe position now so ably filled by\nhim for re-election.\nA Jackson special to the Merid\nian Press says:\n"The State treasury receipts for\nthe month of January foot up $781.-\n000. This is the largest amount of\nreceipts ever turned in for any\none month. The January receipts\nlast year were $721,000, and for the\nyear previous they were $690,000."\nThe large increase for January\nwas due to the call made by the\nAuditor upon the several sheriffs\nand tax collectors for "hurry" set\ntlements of taxes early in the sea\nson, which call was readily and\nliberally resonded to, and prob\nably should have made a greater\ndifference in comparison with for\nmer years than is apparent in the\nparagraph quoted, other things\nbeing equal. The receipts later\non will probably show a compara\ntive decrease.\nDcVltt\'a Witch Hsssl Salve\nThe only positive enre for blind, itching,\nbleeding and protruding pile, eat, barns\nbrats, eeaema and all abrasion of th\nskin.

Richmond P. Hobson has\ntendered his resignation from the\nUnited States navy and it is said\nthat it will be promptly accepted.\nHis assignment to take charge of\nconstruction work at the navy yard\nat Bremerton, Washington, was\nthe straw that broke the camel\'s\nback, and he resigned in prefer\nence to submitting to it. Since\nthe sinking of the Merrimac at\nSantiago harbor he has imagined\nhimself a hero and that the United\nStates navy in a sense belonged to\nhim, and there has been more or\nless friction with the department\nin consequence. Hobson divides\nbis bangs in the center of the fore\nhead, which is consistent with his\neccentric genius.\n-\nThe Meridian Star has a flatter\ning editorial suggesting Mr. P. W.\nMaer of the Columbus Dispatch,\nfor one of the seats in the legisla\nture from Lowndes county, since\nit is learned that Major J.T. Senter\nwill not enter the list for re-election.\n,We cordially indorse the\nsuggestion, not only on account of\nMr. Maer\'s capability in all re\nspects, but for the reason that the\nState press deserves to be more\ngenerally represented in the legis\nlature than it has ever been in the\npast. If it is capable of "mould\ning public opinion" at home it is\nequally able to exert a good influ\nence in the enactment of statutes,\nand of all interests in the State the\nnewspaper fraternity has suffered\nmore by inimical legislation and\nbeen more universally ignored by\nDemocratic general assemblies\nsince the session of 1876, than any\nother."\nA fat mackerel isveryacaroe bat\nwe have tnem.

His friends all\nover the State will regret to learn\nof his resignation and determina\ntion not to accept re-election, for\nhe has served faithfully, honora\nbly and with distinguished ability\nduring the past three years, and\npeople and bar alike regret the\nK-verance.\nAssistant Attorney-General Wm\nWilliama, of Himpsou county, was\nimmediately appointed to succeed\nto the oflice.\nlit-auvoir, tbe historic home of\nJefferson Davis, was formally trans\nferred to the Mississippi Division\nof Sons of Veterans last Tuesday.\nThe conveyance was for a cousid\ne rat ion of $10,000, which was rais\ned under the auspices of the Sons\nof Confederate Veteraus, and pro\nvides a home for indigent Confed\nerate soldiers und sailors and their\nwidows and orphans. This is a\nnoble work that has been accom\nplished by the offspring of our\ndead and living heroes and will stand\nas a monument to them as long as\npatriotism lives or time lasts. It\nneeds the beuediction of the legis\nlature in the way of an appropria\ntion to keep the estate in repair\nand to contribute to the mainte\nnance of the battle-scarred that will\nfind refuge within its walls. Tho\nheart of the next legislature will\nbe frozen or hard as Adamant if it\nfails to provide liberally for th\ncomfort and supjxjrt of this Home.\nThose who favor statutory pro\nhibition for Mississippi are anx\niously concerned as to what the at\ntitude of Bishop C. H. Gallown\nwill be. The splendid re\nsults of local option are so evident\nin the State as to justify the an\nticiation that when Mr. Gal Iowa)\nis heard from he will favor the ed\nucative plan of righting the whisky\nevil instead of the coerci\'e method\nand advocate local option as here\ntofore. Within the past two decades the\ntemperance sentiment has been\neducated to that point that has\ncaused the people in their moral\nstrength to drive the saloou from\nsixty-three out of the seventy-five\ncounties of the State of their own\nvolition and it would be an exper\niment, to say the least of it, to sub\nntitute another plan to complete\nthe work. -What more effective\nway can be found to remove an\nevil than to teach the people to do\nit themselves ? This, local option\nhas done in a large area of the\nState and if left alone will accom\nplish State Temperance, which is\nincomparably better than Statf\nProhibition, because it is ground\ned in the moral nature of the peo\nple, while State Prohibition if\nforonl through fear of punishment\nThere is a lively demand for\nmules in this county.

The Pell Coos.\n; The careful and painstaking work\nof the gentlemen engaged by tbe\nboard of supervisors to purge the\nregistration book and prepare a\nlist of qualified electors of Hinds\ncounty, has been completed and\nshows that about 2,24G of the fifty\nor more thousand citizens of the\ncounty were properly registered\non or before the 7th day of Sep\ntember, 1902, and entitled to sigu\nthe local option election petition,\nthe presentation of which called\nfor the preparation of the list.\n, But it is not of the merits of the\npetition the Clarion-Ledger takes\noccasion to say a word, nor of the\naction of tbe board in not calling\nthe election. Both have been pass\ned on in a regular way, and are mat\nters of history about which there\nis nothing unpleasant or unsavory,\nexcept as one was allied.\nTo begin with, the registration\nand poll books of a county are\nmore loosely kept, and conveys a\nmore uncertain idea of the real\nsituation as it applies to voters,\nthan any other set of tooks kept\nby county or State. While in the\ncare of the circuit clerk, who is\nsupposed to be the only person\nauthorized so touch them with pen\nor pencil, they appear to be public\nproperty, being called into use\nwhenever there is a contest of any\ncharacter before the board of su\nlervisors requiring their presence,\nor whenever a primary of any kind\nis held during which time they\nare defaced, mutilated and render\ned unintelligible, and returned to\nthe clerk iu that condition.\nAgain, as the registration books\nind assessment r lis, as npplied to\nthe suffrage question, Are so close\nly allied, the assessor should have\na mind for the welfare of the\nState, beyond the mere desire to\ndo his duty, and assess every man\nliable.\nFor instance, Andrew Jackson\nSmith registers at Liberty Grove.\nA few mouths later a poorly equip\nped sub-assessor iu the ame pre\ncinct meets, and assesses him as\nAndrew Smith. The next year\nstill another zealous deputy assess\nes him in Pearl as Jackson Smith,\n"and the next year he gets on the\nbooks of Taylor\'s store, may-be, as\nAndy Smith. About this time he\nchanges his residence to Jackson\nand becomes a voter but the diffi\nculty of traciug his tax-paying re\nceipt is apparent; as the person\nhunting it must find out the tran\nsitory character of the man, be fa\nmiliar with th numerous nick\nnames by which he is called and\nthen, after searching through half\na dozen precincts, try and reconcile\nthe difference between his name as\nsubscribed on the registration book\nand as it or they appear on the\nother books.\nIt is thus practically impossible\nto prepare a correct list of the\nqualified electors of any county,\nand this condition will remain un\nchanged until the tax receipt be\ncomes in fact the "open sesame"\nto the ballot box. Such a thing is\nperhaps repugnant to many in\ntelligent American citizens, and\nwill continue so, but just the same\nthe law as it now stands makes tbe\ntax receipt an importaut factor,\nand we might as well go the full\nstep and make it the registration\npaper that is, unless something\nbetter is to be had.
