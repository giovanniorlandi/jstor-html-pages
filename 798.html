Ross\nBackground\nExpert-consensus guidelines have been developed for how\nmembers of the public should assist a person with a mental\nhealth problem or in a mental health crisis.\nAims\nThis review aimed to examine the range of guidelines that have\nbeen developed and how these have been implemented in\npractice.\nMethod\nA narrative review was carried out based on a systematic search\nfor literature on the development or implementation of the\nguidelines.\nResults\nThe Delphi method has been used to develop a wide range of\nguidelines for English-speaking countries, Asian countries and a\nnumber of other cultural groups. The primary implementation\nhas been through informing the content of training courses.\nConclusion\nFurther work is needed on guidelines for low- and middleincome\ncountries.\nDeclaration of interest\nA.F.J. is an unpaidmember of the Board ofMental Health First Aid\nInternational (trading as Mental Health First Aid Australia), which\nis a not-for-profit organisation.\nKeywords\nAlcohol disorders; anxiety disorders; self-harm; depressive disorders;\ndrugs of dependence disorders.\nCopyright and usage\n©The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2018.

The first aid is given until appropriate professional help is\nreceived or until the crisis resolves’.1 More recently, the definition\nhas been broadened to also include the help offered to a person\n‘experiencing the worsening of a mental health problem’.2 This\nconcept distinguishes the initial assistance given by a layperson\nfrom ongoing carer roles and from professional help.\nThere is evidence to support the importanceof this typeof initial assistance.\nWhen a person develops a mental health problem, they will fre-\nquently turn to others in their social network for help.3 Indeed, seeking\nhelp from family and friends is often one of the first actions taken to\ndeal with mental health problems, and this frequently occurs before\nseeking help from a health professional.4 However, although many\npeople with mental health problems receive positive support from\ntheir social network,5 avoidance and discrimination are also\ncommon,particularly forpeoplewithmore severemental disorders.6–8\nThe reactions from a person’s social network can affect the\noutcome of their mental health problem. A person is more likely\nto seek professional help for a mental health problem if someone\nelse suggests that they do this,9,10 and faster treatment is associated\nwith a better outcome.11,12 It is also known that good social support\nfrom family can aid recovery,13 whereas negative interactions can\nimpede it.14 Positive social support also helps to reduce the\nimpact of traumatic life events.15\nMental health first aid training\nGiven the potential importance of the public providing mental\nhealth first aid, there is a need to improve public knowledge and\nskills in this area. For this reason, a Mental Health First Aid\n(MHFA) training course for the public was developed in Australia\nin 2000 and has been disseminated to many other countries.16\nThis course is an adaptation of the first aid training model used\nfor physical health emergencies and it covers developing mental\nhealth problems (e.g. depression, psychosis, substance use problems)\nand mental health crises (e.g. suicidal, self-injuring, exposed to a\ntraumatic event). MHFA training was initially developed to train\nadults to assist other adults,17 but has since been extended to\nadults to assist youth,18 to adolescents to assist their peers19 and\nto adults to assist older persons.20 There have also been a number\nof adaptations of the training to cover cultural subgroups.21,22\nEarly in the development of MHFA training in Australia, it\nbecame apparent that there was limited evidence available on how\namember of the public should give mental health first aid. The techniques\ntaught in conventional, physical first aid courses are based on\ninternational guidelines that have been developed using systematic\nreviews of the literature and expert consensus.23 There is thus a need\nto develop similar international guidelines for the provision of\nmental health first aid. The purpose of this review was to examine\nthe range of guidelines that have been developed, their implementation\nin practice and to identify any gaps that remain to be filled.\nMethod\nTo find relevant research, we carried out a systematic search of databases\nand guidelines listed on the MHFA Australia website (www.\nmhfa.com.au), which includes grey literature. The inclusion criteria\nwere: (a) reports on mental health first aid guidelines, with ‘mental\nhealth first aid’ defined as by Kitchener et al;2 (b) the primary\npurpose of guidelines is provision of mental health first aid; and\nBJPsych Open (2018)\n4, 427–440. doi: 10.1192/bjo.2018.58\n427\n', '(c) articles that detail the development of guidelines, uses/implementations\nof guidelines and evaluations of guidelines. Exclusion\ncriteria were: (a) guidelines developed for health professionals (psychiatrists,\npsychologists, counsellors, physicians, etc.), including\nclinical practice guidelines; (b) guidelines aimed at carers (involving\nlonger-term caring roles); and (c) guidelines for the provision of\nmedical first aid. Items published in a language other than\nEnglish were to be translated into English. Records were excluded\nif reasonable efforts to obtain full-text copies were unsuccessful.\nSearches were carried out in PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus and\nWeb of Science on 4 April 2018. The search terms were ‘mental\nhealth first aid’ across all four databases, limiting the results from\nyear 2000 to the present day.\nFigure 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram. A total of 55 records\nmet eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Both authors\nread through records, extracting main points of information into a\nsummary table of MHFA guidelines. Included records were classified\nas involving guideline development, guideline evaluation and\nguideline implementation.\nResults\nThe 56 studies covered guidelines for assisting people with specific\nmental health problems in English-speaking countries (13 studies),\nguidelines for assisting people with mental health problems from\nhigh-risk groups and settings in English-speaking countries (six\nstudies), guidelines for assisting Australian Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islander people (six studies), guidelines for assisting people\nfrom Asian countries (five studies), cross-cultural generalisability\nof guidelines (one study) and implementation of the guidelines in\npractice (25 studies).\nMethods used for developing guidelines\nMental health first aid guidelines have been developed based on\nexpert consensus using the Delphi method.24–26 The Delphi\nmethod is supported by research on ‘wisdom of crowds’ which\nshows that aggregated judgements of groups of people with imperfect\nexpertise can lead to better decisions than individual experts.26\nThis method involves recruiting a group of individuals with expertise\non a topic, compiling a questionnaire with a list of statements\nthat the experts rate for agreement, providing anonymous feedback\nto individuals on how their responses compare with the rest of the\ngroup, giving members the opportunity to revise their responses\nbased on the feedback over a number of survey rounds and using\na statistical criterion to define consensus.24–26 There are many\nways in which Delphi methodology can be implemented. The application\nof this method for the development of mental health first aid\nguidelines has involved the steps described below.\nFraming of research questions\nThe Delphi studies have been guided by a question that defines the\nscope of the project. The questions covered the type of person who is\nproviding the help (e.g. adult,1 adolescent,27 workplace colleague28),\nthe type of person who is being helped (e.g. Aboriginal or Torres\nStrait Islander person,29 adolescent,30 LGBTIQ+ person31) and the\ntype of mental health issue the person has (e.g. suicidal thoughts\nand behaviours,32 psychosis,1 panic attack33).\nSelection of expert panels\nThe chosen panelmembers have relevant expertise; this expertisemay\nhave been gained through professional experience or from lived\nexperience as a consumer or carer. In all the projects on guidelines,\na panel of mental health professionals has been used. Wherever possible,\nthere have also been panels of consumers and carers who have\ntaken on advocacy roles, either through membership of advocacy\norganisations or by creating peer support resources. The requirement\nfor consumers and carers to also have an advocacy role was to ensure\nthat their expertise was broader than their own individual experience.\nHowever, in some areas it was difficult to find lived-experience experts\nbecause relevant mental health advocacy organisations are rare or do\nnot exist, for example in Asian countries and for cultural minorities\nsuch as Aboriginal Australians and refugees.\nDetermining expert panel size\nPanels consisting of 20 or more members tend to produce stable\nresults.26 Because there are generally dropouts across rounds of a\nDelphi study, the aim was to have a minimum of 30 experts on a\npanel at the start of the study. However, experts on some topics\nare so scarce that this number has not been possible (e.g. mental\nhealth professionals with experience working with Iraqi refugees\nin Australia34), so smaller panels have been used.\nConstruction of Delphi questionnaires\nThe Delphi questionnaires have listed potential actions that a first\naider can take to assist a person with a mental health problem as\nwell as potential knowledge they may need to guide their actions.\nThe questionnaires were constructed in such a way as to give a comprehensive\nlist of possibilities to the panel members to consider. For\nmost studies on guidelines, this has been achieved by a systematic\nsearch for possible actions in websites, books and journal articles.\nThe text from these sources was qualitatively analysed to arrive at a\nset of items that clearly express a single action, while trying to\nremain as faithful as possible to the original wording in the source.\nOne member of the research team carried out a draft content analysis\nwhich was presented to the other researchers in the team, who then\nagree on the final wording of questionnaire items. Additional items\nhave been created from gaps identified by the research team and by\npanel members when they were responding to the initial questionnaire.\nItems that have been included in the questionnaire have some-\ntimes been contradictory because of differingopinions in the literature\nabout appropriate first aid actions (for example, ‘the first aider should\nsay whatever they feel they need to help the suicidal person decide\nagainst suicide, including the use of guilt and threats, e.g. telling\nthem they will go to hell or they will ruin the lives of others if they\ndie by suicide’ versus ‘the first aider should not use guilt or threats\nto prevent suicide, e.g. do not tell the person they will go to hell or\nruin other people’s lives if they die by suicide’).32\nFor some guidelines, a systematic search has been a poor source\nof questionnaire items because of the limited literature on the topic.\nThis was the case for guidelines on how an adult should communicate\nwith an adolescent about a mental health problem or other sen-\nsitive topic.27 In this case, focus groups of consumers and clinicians\nwere used to generate additional items for the questionnaire.\nAdministration of Delphi questionnaires\nQuestionnaires were administered by web survey which made it\npossible to have panel members from around the world. Panellists\nwere asked to rate items according to whether they should be\nincluded in the guidelines using the following scale: ‘essential’,\n‘important’, ‘don’t know/depends’, ‘unimportant’ or ‘should not\nbe included’. Panellists were provided with comment boxes to\nprovide reasons for their responses, suggest additional items or\nsuggest modifications to wording of items.\nAnalysis of Delphi rounds and providing feedback to the panel\nIn most of the Delphi studies, items that were endorsed as essential\nor important by 80% or more of each panel were accepted, whereas\nJorm & Ross\n428\n', 'items that were endorsed by 70–79% were put back to the panels to\nbe rerated in the subsequent survey round. Items endorsed by less\nthan 70% of the panel were rejected. For a small number of\nDelphi studies, the required endorsement rate was increased to\n90% or decreased to 70% to reflect differences in overall endorsement\nrates. For example, Australian Indigenous panels tended to\nhave high endorsement rates across items, so the cut-off for inclusion\nwas raised to 90%.29 By contrast, Japanese experts were less\nlikely to rate items highly and more often used the don’t know/\ndepends option, so the cut-off was lowered to 70%.35\nWhen items were rerated, feedback was given to panel members\nabout the ratings of all the panels on each item, as well as their own\nratings. They were then given an opportunity to rerate the items in\nthe subsequent survey round. Items that received low ratings (typically\nunder 70%) were not rerated as experience has shown that\nrerating does not result in such major changes that the endorsement\nthreshold (typically 80%) is reached.\nReliability of Delphi results\nData on the reliability of expert panel judgements could be\nobtained from Delphi studies that were performed on the same\ntopic at two time points. This was done for suicide first aid by comparing\ncommon items from two Delphi studies on how to support a\nsuicidal person.32,36 The correlation across item frequencies was\n0.84 between 22 professionals in the earlier study and 41 professionals\nin the later one. Similarly, there was a correlation of 0.77\nbetween endorsement frequencies for a panel of 16 consumers\nand carers in the earlier study and 35 consumers from the later\nstudy. Given the passage of 6 years between the studies and the\nsmall size of some of the panels, this shows a high degree of\nreliability.\nFive of the Delphi studies also looked at agreement between\nprofessional, consumer and carer panels within the same Delphi\nstudy (summarised in Table 1). Despite considerable variation in\nsource of expertise, the level of agreement across expert panels is\nvery high.\nConstruction of guidelines from endorsed items\nGuideline documents were constructed from the endorsed items by\nconnecting them together under headings to make a coherent text.\nThe guidelines were sent back to the expert panellists for comment\nand final approval before publication.\nPsycINFO (n = 113)\nLiterature search databases: \nPubMed (n = 128)\nScopus (n = 154)\nWeb of Science (n = 118)\nLimits: year 2000–current \n(n = 510)\nSc\nre\nen\nin\ng\nIn\ncl\nud\ned\nEl\nig\nib\nili\nty\nId\nen\ntifi\nca\ntio\nn\nAdditional records identified through other \nsources: publications cited on the Mental\nHealth First Aid Australia website including\nrecords that detail development, evaluation\nor use of MHFA guidelines; publications in\nsubmission known to the authors \n                           (n = 7)   \nRecords after duplicates removed\n(n = 195)\nRecords excluded\n(n = 178)\nFull-text articles assessed\nfor eligibility\n(n = 73)\n \nRecords screened \n(n = 195)\nStudies included in\nquantitative synthesis\n(meta-analysis)\n(n = N/A)\nStudies included in\nqualitative synthesis\n(n = 56)\nNot report on MHFA\nguidelines (n = 5) \nNot implementation of\nMHFA guidelines (n = 12) \nFull-text articles excluded,\ndue to exclusion/inclusion\ncriteria\n(n =17) \nFig. 1 PRISMA flow diagram.\nGuidelines for the public on how to provide mental health first aid\n429\n', 'Guidelines for English-speaking countries\nGuidelines have been developed for assisting with a range of mental\nhealth problems, as summarised in Table 2. All have involved the\nuse of both professional and lived-experience expert panels, with\n80% or greater endorsement required from all panels for inclusion\nin the guidelines. Given the need to keep guidelines up to date,\ntwo of the guidelines – on suicidal thoughts and behaviours and\nnon-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) – have been revised in new\nstudies. Other guidelines have been developed to assist people in\nhigh-risk groups or settings (see Table 3).\nAlthough there is broad agreement across various types\nof experts on appropriate first aid actions, the various Delphi\nstudies have noted differences as well, which are summarised\nin Table 4. The areas of difference are diverse and influenced\nby the type of first aid situation (e.g. the urgency of action)\nand the type of person in the role of first aider (e.g. adolescent\nversus adult). Nevertheless, there are some common themes\nacross a number of these studies. Professionals place a greater\nemphasis on privacy, confidentiality and on first aiders not\nstraying into professional roles. Consumers place greater emphasis\non autonomy in decision making and talking about feelings,\nwhereas carers place greater emphasis on taking action to protect\nthe person.\nGuidelines for Asian countries\nAs summarised in Table 5, guidelines have been developed for\nassisting a suicidal person in various Asian countries, where professionals\nfrom individual countries were used as expert panellists.\nHowever, other guidelines for assisting a person with psychosis\nhave been developed using professional experts from a range of\nAsian countries. All of these Delphi studies required 80% or more\nendorsement for inclusion in the guidelines, except for the study\non first aid for a suicidal person in Japan,35 which used a criterion\nof 70% or more, due to the greater tendency of Japanese experts\nto give responses of don’t know/depends.\nNone of these guidelines have had expert panels of consumers\nor carers because of the rarity of consumer and carer advocacy\norganisations in these countries. Another limiting factor was\nthat the Delphi studies were carried out in English due to\nresource limitations. This has also limited the participation of\nconsumer and carer experts as they were less likely to have the\nhigh level of English comprehension required. This may have\nresulted in bias towards the expertise of clinicians who have had\nWestern training.\nGuidelines for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander people\nA range of guidelines were developed for Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islander people, as summarised in Table 6. All but one of\nthese guidelines used Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander clinicians\nas experts; in the case of problem gambling, it was not possible to\nrecruit an all-Aboriginal panel. As with Asian countries, it proved\nimpossible to find sufficient Aboriginal consumer and carer advocates\nto tap into lived-experience expertise. Nevertheless, it was\nfound in the studies of suicidal thoughts and behaviours and NSSI\nthat most of the Aboriginal professionals had personal experience\nas well as professional experience, so they could draw on these different\nsources of expertise.37,38 All of these Delphi studies required\n90% or greater endorsement for inclusion, with the high criterion set\nbecause of the high rates of item endorsement by these experts.\nCross-cultural generalisability\nBecause Delphi studies to develop suicide first aid guidelines have\nbeen carried out for a range of Asian countries and high-income\nEnglish-speaking countries, it has been possible to compare the\nresults to see whether they are similar across countries and cultures.39\nComparing results for English-speaking countries, Sri\nLanka, Japan, India, the Philippines and for refugees and immigrants,\ncorrelations across items in endorsement rates were all\n0.60 or above, but were higher for countries that are socioeconomically\nsimilar. These results indicate that suicide first aid actions are\ngeneralisable across countries and cultures to some degree. These\nactions include assessing the risk of suicide, listening to the\nperson, showing care and respect and ensuring the person’s\nsafety. However, there is also some cultural specificity, indicating\na need for local tailoring of the guidelines. For example, differences\nwere found regarding how appropriate it was thought to be for a first\naider to dissuade a person from suicide and to try to solve their problems,\nand there was variation related to availability of services.\nSimilarly, it was possible to compare the ratings of Aboriginal\nand Torres Strait Islander professionals with those of experts from\nEnglish-speaking countries. For ratings of NSSI items, the\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander panel had a correlation of\n0.73 with the English-speaking consumer panel and 0.71 with the\nEnglish-speaking professional panel.37 Similarly, the correlations\nfor items on suicidal thoughts and behaviours were 0.79 and 0.77,\nrespectively.38 Again, these results indicate a high degree of crosscultural\ngeneralisability. However, there were also differences, e.g.\nin communication issues and evaluation of urgency in taking action.\nImplementation of the guidelines\nThe aim of mental health first aid guidelines is to improve the supportive\nbehaviours of the public towards people with mental health\nproblems. However, it has been noted both in the literature on clinical\npractice guidelines and on Delphi studies that these are not suf-\nficient to produce changes in behaviour and that specific\nimplementation strategies are necessary.26,40 Below is a review of\nstrategies that have aimed to implement the guidelines in practice.\nGuiding the content of training courses\nThe guidelines were primarily developed to inform the content of\nMHFA training courses. In developing the first edition of the\nAustralian MHFA course,41 it was recognised that there was little\nevidence on which to base mental health first aid strategies for the\npublic. As the guidelines in Tables 2 and 3 have been developed\nover time, they have been used to inform the content of subsequent\neditions of the Australian Standard MHFA course (for adults\nhelping adults),42–44 the Youth MHFA training course (for adults\nTable 1 Correlations across items in endorsement frequencies for\ndifferent types of expert panels\nDelphi topic Expert groups compared\nCorrelations\nacross items\nSuicidal ideation and\nbehaviour32\nProfessionals and consumers 0.92 (round 1)\n0.80 (round 2)\nNon-suicidal\nself-injury79\nProfessionals and consumers 0.91 (round 1)\n0.75 (round 2)\nGambling problems80 Professionals and livedexperience\nexperts\n0.82\nCognitive impairment\nor dementia81\nProfessionals and carers 0.81\nWorkplace mental\nhealth28\nConsumers and managers 0.88\nConsumers and workplace\nmental health professionals\n0.86\nManagers and workplace mental\nhealth professionals\n0.92\nJorm & Ross\n430\n', 'Table 2 Guidelines for assisting people with specific mental health problems in English-speaking countries\nAuthors, year Topic Types of experts (N)a\nNumber of\nitems endorsed/\nnumber rated Main themes in guidelines\nKelly et al, 200836 Suicidal thoughts\nand behaviour\nProfessionals (N = 15–22), people who had\nbeen suicidal in the past (N = 7–10) and\ncarers of people who had been suicidal in\nthe past (N = 0–6)\n30/114 Identification of suicide risk;

The mental\nhealth first aid guidelines for Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander people (see Table 5) have been used to inform the\ncontent of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander MHFA course\nwhich is taught by instructors from those communities.50 The key\nelements of the various guidelines have been summarised in the\nform of an action plan, which is taught in the course. The most\nrecent version of the MHFA Action Plan is:\n(a) approach the person, assess and assist with any crisis\n(b) listen and communicate non-judgementally\n(c) give support and information\n(d) encourage the person to get appropriate professional help\n(e) encourage other supports.43\nThere have been 18 controlled trials of the Standard and Youth\nMHFA courses, of which 10 trials of the second and subsequent editions\nof the courses were informed by the mental health first aid\nguidelines listed in Tables 2 and 3. A recent systematic review and\nmeta-analysis of MHFA trials showed improvements up to\n6 months following training in mental health first aid knowledge,\nrecognition of mental health problems, beliefs about effective treatments,\nstigma, confidence and intentions to help, and in the amount\nof mental health first aid provided.51\nThe Standard and Youth MHFA courses have been widely\nimplemented in Australia, with over 0.5 million people trained by\n2017, which is over 2% of the population. MHFA training has\nspread from Australia to more than 20 other countries, with over\ntwo million people trained globally.52\nA teen MHFA course has also been developed for adolescents\naged 15–18 years to learn how to assist their peers,53 with the\nTable 2 (Continued )\nAuthors, year Topic Types of experts (N)a\nNumber of\nitems endorsed/\nnumber rated Main themes in guidelines\nHart et al, 200960 Eating disorders Clinicians (N = 27–36), caregivers (N = 24–27)\nand consumers (N = 14–22)\n200/456 What eating disorders are; approaching\nsomeone who may have an eating disorder;\ngetting professional help; how to continue to\nbe supportive; eating disorders in children\nand young people\nKelly et al, 201085 Adult affected by a\ntraumatic event\nProfessionals working in trauma (N = 23–39)\nand consumers and carers who had been\naffected by a traumatic event (N = 12–17)\n65/180 What the first priorities for helping someone\nafter a traumatic event are; what the\npriorities are if I am helping after a mass\ntraumatic event; how to talk to someone\nwho has just experienced a traumatic event;\nwhether we should we talk about what\nhappened and how to support someone in\ndoing so; how to help the person to cope\nover the next few weeks or months; when\nthe person should seek professional help\nKelly et al, 201085 Child affected by a\ntraumatic event\nProfessionals working in trauma (N = 17–22)\nand consumers and carers who had been\naffected by a traumatic event (N = 10–12)\n71/155 What the first priorities are for helping a child\nafter a traumatic event; what the priorities\nare if I am helping after a mass traumatic\nevent; how to talk to a child who has\nexperienced a traumatic event; what should\nbe done if a child has told me they are being\nabused; how should I behave at home if I am\na parent/guardian and the child I am helping\nlives with me; dealing with temper tantrums\nand avoidance behaviours; whether the\nchild should receive professional help\nKingston et al,\n201186\nProblem drug use Clinicians (N = 20–27), consumers (people\nwith a past history of drug use) (N = 25–29)\nand carers (people with a past history of\ncaring for someone with problem drug\nuse) (N = 25–31)\n140/228 Approaching the person about drug use\nproblems; what to do if the person is\nunwilling to change their drug use;\nprofessional and other help; drug-affected\nstates\nBond et al,\n201681\nCognitive\nimpairment or\ndementia in an\nolder person\nHealth professionals specialising in research\nor treatment of dementia (N = 43–56) and\ncarers of people with dementia who are in\nan advocacy role (N = 22–24)\n389/656 What to do if you are concerned that a person\nmay be developing dementia; supporting the\nperson with dementia; communicating with\nthe confused person; discussing sensitive\nissues; behaviours that you may find\nchallenging; assisting the confused person\nwho is wandering; delirium\nBond et al,\n201680\nGambling problems Professionals experienced in research or\ntreatment of problem gambling\n(N = 32–41) and people with lived\nexperience of a gambling problem or of\nassisting a family member or friend with a\ngambling problem and have experience\nin an advocacy or peer-support role\n(N = 34–40)\n234/412 Motivations for gambling; how to tell if someone\nhas gambling problems; approaching\nsomeone about their gambling; encouraging\nprofessional help; encouraging the person to\nchange; if the person does not want to\nchange; supporting the person to change;\nwhat to do if you are concerned for the\nsafety of the person or others\nNSSI, non-suicidal self-injury.\na.

An uncontrolled evaluation (with measures at pre-,\npost- and 6-months follow-up) found a number of improvements,\nincluding in mental health first aid knowledge, confidence to help\nand stigma.63 However, no change in helping behaviours was\nfound over the follow-up period.\nProviding mental health first aid information on the internet and in print\nDocuments onmental health first aid guidelines have been provided\nas free downloads on the internet.64 An evaluation has been carried\nout on the usefulness and impact of these guidelines on people who\ndownload them. People using these resources were asked to complete\na pop-up questionnaire at the time of the download and\nwere then followed up a month later to ask what use they had\nmade of the guidelines. Most people reported that they downloaded\nthe guidelines because their job involved contact with people with\nmental illness. Although the response rate at follow-up was only\n22%, there were people who reported that they had used the guidelines\nto assist someone and that the person had sought professional\nhelp as a result. The same methodology was used in a study of a\nFrench-language version of the eating disorders guidelines that\nwas made available on a website aimed at French college students.65\nResults were similar, with a small minority of people reporting that\nthey used the information to assist someone, including encouraging\nprofessional help.\nGuidelines have also been used to provide print information.\nPsychosis first aid guidelines have been included in a book for\npatients and their families, but no evaluation has been carried out\non the impact of this book.66\nEvaluating the quality of mental health first aid information\nSuicide first aid guidelines have been used as a standard to evaluate\nthe quality of information presented on suicide-prevention websites.67\nA checklist was developed from the guidelines to score\nwhether 26 suicide-prevention actions were recommended on\neach website. The quality of information was found to be highly\nvariable, with scores ranging from 1 to 19. In an effort to improve\nthe quality of the information provided, a randomised controlled\ntrial was carried out on a feedback intervention. A report on a website’s\nquality was sent to a random half of the website administra-\ntors, while the other half served as controls. However, the\nfeedback reports were not found to have any effect when the\nquality of the websites was reassessed 6 months later.\nAssessing the quality of mental health first aid responses\nMental health first aid guidelines have been used to assess quality of\nmental health first aid intentions and actions in surveys of the\ngeneral public, most of whom have had no mental health training.\nThe assessment on intentions involved presenting a respondent\nwith a vignette describing a person with a mental health problem\nand then asking the respondent what they would do if this person\nwas someone they knew and cared about. The assessment on\nactions involved asking what the respondent had done to help an\nactual person with a problem similar to the one portrayed in a\nvignette. Schemes for scoring the quality of responses was developed\nbased on the MHFA Action Plan taught in MHFA courses.

The\nfirst relates to the breadth of the evidence base. In contrast to physical\nfirst aid guidelines which uses evidence from trials, case series or\nanimal evidence,78 all of the mental health first aid guidelines are\nbased on expert opinion. There is also a lack of evidence on\nwhether actions based on the guidelines lead to better health and\nwell-being outcomes. A second limitation is that some of the guidelines\nwere based only on professional expertise, as it was not possible\nto recruit experts with lived experience. Thirdly, all of the Delphi\nstudies for Asian countries were carried out in English rather than\nthe local languages, which may have biased the recruitment of\nexperts towards those with Western training and limited the opportunity\nfor participation by experts with lived experience. Finally, the\nauthors of this review were involved in the studies on the guidelines,\nso this is not an independent review. Most of the guideline implementation\nhas been carried out by those that developed the guide-\nlines, but there is considerable scope for others to use them to\ninform training and other educational programs.\nFuture directions\nA major gap is the lack of guidelines that are appropriate for lowand\nmiddle-income countries. People in these countries may\ndiffer from those in high-income countries in their vocabulary to\ndescribemental health problems and crises, in the emphasis on individualistic\nversus collectivistic values, in social role constraints on\ntaking action and in the availability of formal mental health services.\nWherever possible, such guidelines should be developed in local languages\nand have diverse panels, including experts with lived\nexperience.\nThere is a need for further exploration of the cross-cultural generalisability\nof guidelines. Although the ideal might be to develop a\nfull suite of guidelines for each country and cultural group, this\nwould be a mammoth task that is likely to be beyond the available\nresources.
