The\ntruth Ih the News In such a i -jul !\nand Jaundiced partisan of the I\'tiher\nttlty It cannot nee the A. k M. College\nnor any of the other State education\nal Institutions. The persistency with\nwhich the News has fought the A. A\nM. College and the MtterneHH and\nvenom It has Injected Into the edi\ntorial utterance In the fight, are un\nworthy a journal of the News\' repu\ntation and atnndiiiK In Texan. The\nstand It has taken against the Colleue\nIn every question that lias come up -the\nconsolidation of the College with\nthe fnlvcrsity, rcmowtl of the Col\nlege, Itesolutlon m, the one hoard\nmovement, etc. has heen no blindly\npartisan a to create the Impression\nthat the New would 1 i k to se tlie\nCollece torn down, not leaving one\nstone upon another, the pruind plowed\nup and sown down !:h sa!t.\nThe Newg featured, fa.ore.l anil e\nJilolted t!ie re t-nt Mezes fii!liiin:itlcn.\nwhich was no more nor lcs than ti e\nopening gun in the renewed tight\nagainst the A. & M. College. The\nnew fight carries all the hl\'ternes of\nthe old ones, with added bitterness,\nvenom, spleen, gall, poison, hate,\njealousy and wormwood, fanned Into\na ronsuming fire, because of the fa t\nthe large sum of money to come into\nTexas through the Smith Lever art\nIs to be expended through the A. it M.\nCollege and not through the State fnl\nverslty. The News would have the people\nnelieve the resolution declaring for\nseparation, offered by the friends of\nthe College. Is so partial that it would\nRive everything to the A. & M. Col\nlege and leave the Cnlverslty shorn\nof Its rights and powers and be a uni\nversity in name only.\nThat argument Is pure rot and the\nNews Knows It. and gives It publica\ntion solely for political effect and to\nIdas and prejudice and po\'son the\nminds of the people. The friends of\nthe A. & M. College have no such pur\npose in mind. They want separation\nto do away with the strife now exist\ning between the two Instlutlons, and\nthey want both provided for in such\na way as will take them out of poll\ntics. There Is no feeling of Jealousy\non their part, but on the other hand\nthey are actuated by patriotic motives\nand want the two Institutions to be\nfo clothed and vested with power tint\nill enable them to fullilt the great\ndestinies Intended for them by the\nfathers who founded them.\nTHE PRAIRIE VIEW INSTITUTION.\nGovernor Ferguson Is said to have\nremarked to Senator Astln, in explain\ning his attitude toward a proposed\nemergency appropriation for the I\'ral\nrie View Normal and Industrial Col\nlege: "I want to serve notice on you\nright now that K. F. Illackshear. the\nhead of that Institution, has got to go."\nIf It be true that the Covernor is\naccurately reported, tin Tost, express\ning the hope of those who are deeply\ninterested In that excellent institution,\nis trusting that the Covernor will take\nno precipitate action in the premises\nwithout a full personal Investigation\nthat shnll prove conclusively to his\nmind the good of the Institution would\nbe promoted by the dismissal of the\nprincipal.\nIf there Is no more serious objection\nto Blackshear than the letter he wrote\nduring the last campaign expressing\nthe hope that Mr. Ball would be suc\ncessful, we believe Governor Ferguson\nwill not wreak political vengeance\nupon the Institution because of that\nerror.\nVi\'e agree with the Covernor that\nBlackshear was entirely wrong in par\nticipating In the campaign to that ex\ntent. The heads of our educational in\nstitutions ought to keep out of politics,\nand, above all, the negro educators\nhave no business meddling In Demo\ncratic contests.
