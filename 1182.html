Above all else safety is the most\nimportant element to be considered. The Hatties\nburg Trust and Banking Company represents a com\nbination of elements which make a financial institu\ntion thoroughly reliable. It has Capital of $150,000.00\nstanding as protection for all deposits as well as Un\ndivided Profits amounting to $21,000.00, this latter fund\nbeing increased from time to time from the earnings\nof the institution. The banking laws of the State of\nMississippi place rigid restrictions upon the manner\nin which it may loan its funds and also provide for\nregular examinations into its affairs under the direc\ntion of the State Bank Examiner. The final element\nwhich enters so largely into the stability of a bank is\nits management. If you contemplate opening an\naccount and are not already acquainted with the\ncharacter and ability of men who shape the policies\nof this institution, we trust that you will make thorough\ninquiry. In handling the funds entrusted to their\ncare onlv the most conservative methods are applied—\nmethods which assure unquestioned safety and not\nextensive profits. :::::::\nHattiesburg Trust & Banking\nCompan y $ 1.00 opens a\n4°/c Interest on\nSavings\nHattiesburg, miss.
