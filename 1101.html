        <pre>['Secrets of British Pre-War \nDiplomacy\nBy SIDNEY B. FAY\nP rofessor of E uropean H istory, Sm ith  College; A uthor of \nThe Origins of the World War\nSTUDENTS interested in the question \nof war responsibility owe a debt of \ngratitude to Dr. Gooch and Profes\xad\nsor Temperley for the speed, complete\xad\nness and admirable form (including \nscant notes but full indexes and analyti\xad\ncal table of contents) with which they \nare revealing the long-hidden secrets of \nthe British Foreign Office in the years \nbefore the World War. Though the fourth \nvolume, dealing with Anglo-Russian \nrelations 1906-1909, has been delayed, \nthe fifth volume, just published, tells a \ndetailed story of the way in which the \nfutile efforts for Macedonian reform and \nthe Austrian annexation of Bosnia inten\xad\nsified the opposition and distrust among \nthe grpat powers, and thus contributed \nto the general conflagration of Europe \nin 1914.*\nBy way o f introduction to this volume \nof 800 large quarto pages the editors \nwisely describe in detail, on the basis of \nthe annual reports of the British diplo\xad\nmatic representatives at Constantinople, \nthe system of Oriental absolutism under \nAbdul Hamid II, Sultan of Turkey from \n1876 until his deposition in 1909. The \nwhole machinery of Hamidian govern\xad\nment—or rather misgovernment—cen\xad\ntral and provincial, is set forth as suc\xad\ncinctly and accurately as anywhere in \nEnglish. There are pictured the army, \nnavy, finance, public opinion and educa\xad\ntion of the despotic Ottoman Empire, ap\xad\nparently strong, but actually on the eve \nof its collapse in the Young Turk revo\xad\nlution of 1908.\nThere are shrewd characterizations of\n*British Documents on the Origins of \nthe War, 1898-1914. Edited by G. P. \nGooch and Harold Temperley, with the \nassistance of Lillian M. Penson. Vol. V, \nThe Near East: The Macedonian Prob\xad\nlem and the Annexation of Bosnia, 1903- \n1909. London, 1928. Vols. I-III were \nsummarized in C urrent H istory, Jan., \n1929, pp. 644-649.\nleading Turks in office—or seeking of\xad\nfice—like the Sultan’s chief secretary, \nTahsin Pasha:\nAn excellent clerk and reporter, he is \nmore especially remarkable for his inde\xad\nfatigable assiduity, an extremely reten\xad\ntive memory and a unique faculty for \nself-repression, amounting almost to im\xad\npersonality, which renders him an ideal \n“ insulator”  between his Imperial Master \nand all that portion of the outside world \nof which it may suit His Majesty’s con\xad\nvenience to remain unconscious.\nFor twelve years on end, Summer and \nWinter, Sundays, weekdays and holidays, \nfrom 9:30 A. M. to whatever hour of the \nnight or morning His Majesty may be \npleased to require his services, Tahsin \nPasha has been unremittingly at his post, \nreceiving, classifying and submitting to \nthe Sultan all the voluminous correspond\xad\nence * * * recording and oommunicating \nthe orders or replies of the Sultan to one \nand all, or getting rid of them as best he \nmay when no reply or order is forthcom\xad\ning (V, 7).\nIn contrast to this faithful servant \nwas Izzct Pasha, the second secretary:\nHe very soon succeeded in acquiring a \npowerful influence over the Sultan by \nworking upon his vanity and his personal \nfears. He has made many gross mis\xad\ntakes and has frequently been on the \nverge of disgrace, but his extraordinary \nastuteness and intimate comprehension of \nhis master’s character have invariably \nsufficed to save him from a fall. His \nbest stroke of business was probably his \ninvention of the Hedjaz Railway scheme.\n* * * The bulk of the enormous fortune \nwhich he must undoubtedly have amassed \nis safely invested in Europe, and every \npossible preparation made for a rapid \nflight in case of necessity (V, 8).\nWhen the Minister of Finance pre\xad\nsented his report showing the inevitable \ndeficit of several million pounds, the \nSultan was displeased. But he had only \nto order Izzet to prepare another re\xad\nport; the secretary disappeared, juggled \nthe figures, and speedily returned with \na satisfactory balance sheet in which the \ndeficit was greatly reduced! (V, 200.)\nFrom these British reports one obtains \nthe impression that Abdul Hamid and \nhis government came to be looked upon\n113\n', '116 CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1929\nwith less and less favor by the British \nfrom the time they had come to his res\xad\ncue after the Russo-Turkish War of \n1877-78 until his close friendship with \nEmperor William II a quarter of a cen\xad\ntury later. There were many reasons \nfor this change of feeling: The Arme\xad\nnian massacres and Macedonian out\xad\nrages which offended humanitarian sym\xad\npathies more deeply in Great Britain \nthan on the Continent; the persistent \nevasion of promises of reform which \nwere urged more seriously by Great \nBritain than by any other great power, \nand the consequent difficulties experi\xad\nenced at Constantinople by British con\xad\ncession hunters in comparison with their \nGerman rivals.\nIn his relations with the great powers \nthe Sultan was friendliest toward Ger\xad\nmany, due in part to the Kaiser’s visit \nto Constantinople in 1898, to German \nloans and to German military instruc\xad\ntors. With Great Britain the relations \nwere “ little more than tolerable.”  Though \nformerly distrustful of Russia, since the \nRusso-Japanese War the Sultan “has ex\xad\nhibited feelings of magnanimity toward \nhis former foe, whom he no longer \nthinks dangerous.”  Toward France he \nwas animated by friendly feelings, partly \nbecause of her services in the Crimean \nWar and partly because of the immense \nloans made by Paris bankers. Toward \nAmericans he “ has little more than a \nfeeling of indifference, possibly accom\xad\npanied by dislike of their republican in\xad\nstitutions and their desire, through their \nmissionaries, to spread the light of Chris\xad\ntianity and civilization throughout his \nbenighted land.” Rumania he feared and \nrespected; Bulgaria he cordially disliked \nand mistrusted; Greece he neither dis\xad\nliked nor feared; of Serbia he took little \naccount, save as a possible enemy of \nBulgaria. (V, 43 f .; Annual Report for \n1907.)\nThe Macedonian Question\nThe cry which St. Paul heard in a vi\xad\nsion nineteen centuries ago became shrill \nand real in the Hamidian regime—and \nhas continued to be so. There was a \ntime— in 1878 when the Macedonian \nQuestion might have been settled. By\nthe Treaty of San Stefano, Russia wisely \n(and from self-interest) planned to let \nMacedonia form part of a greater Bul\xad\ngaria, partly because Bulgarians hap\xad\npened incidentally to be the predominant \nelement in Macedonia. But Disraeli, \nwho had thrilled his supporters with a \nnew imperialism, by his acquisition of \nthe Suez Canal and his elevation of \nQueen Victoria to Empress of India, \nfeared that the rival influence o f the \nCzar might penetrate to the Eastern \nMediterranean by way of this greater \nBulgarian puppet-State created by the \ngrace of Russia. So Disraeli stepped for\xad\nward and tore up the Treaty of San \nStefano, thus leaving Macedonia under \nTurkish misrule.\nBordering on Macedonia were the re\xad\ncently formed States of Bulgaria, Greece \nand Serbia. Each of these claimed \nMacedonia on various racial, religious \nand historic grounds. To what ridiculous \nextremes the racial claims went may be \nseen from the rival population figures \nwhich were solemnly presented by each \nof the three nationalities to the Carnegie \nCommission which examined the situa\xad\ntion just before the World War: \nPopulation of Macedonia at the opening \nof the twentieth century, as claimed by \nBulgarian, Greek and Serbian statistics \n( Report of the International Commission \nto Inquire Into the Causes and Conduct \nof the Balkan Wars, Washington, 1914,\np. 29 f.).\nPopulation Bulgarian Greek Serbian \nof Sta- Sta- StaMacedonia.\ntistics. tistics.* tistics.\nTurks ............ 499,204 634,017 231,400\nBulgarians ..1,181,336 332,162 57,600\nGreeks ..........  228,702 652,795 201,140\nSerbians . . . .  700 0 2,048.320\nOthers ..........  348,282 105,844 332,160\nTotals ....... 2,258,224 1,724,818 2,870,620\n*Greek figures omit Kosovo Vilayet, \nand are therefore smaller.\nThe best solution, theoretically speak\xad\ning, would have been to divide Mace\xad\ndonia, separating the nationalities and \nassigning an appropriate part to each \nof the three contiguous national States. \nBut as Bulgars, Greeks and Serbs (not \nto speak of Jews, Gypsies, Turks and \nothers) often lived intermingled in the \nsame town, this solution seemed impos\xad\nsible as a practical measure. Since the \nMacedonian racial omelette could not be \nunscrambled, Bulgarians began to form\n', "SECRETS OF BRITISH PRE-WAR DIPLOMACY 117\nABDUL HAMID II \nSultan of Turkey from 1876 to 1909\narmed bands to assassinate Turks and \nmembers of the two rival Christian pop\xad\nulations, partly to take vengeance on \ntheir Moslem oppressors, partly to in\xad\nduce the great powers to intervene and \nforce a settlement and partly to reduce \nthe number of rival claimants when any \nfinal arrangement should be made. The \nGreeks and the Serbs did likewise, and \nformed their own armed bands with simi\xad\nlar purposes. The Turks were unwilling \nor unable to suppress the Christian \nbands of assassins, and merely sent wild, \nirregular Moslem troops to do a fair \nshare in the work of assassination. This \nrivalry of the three Christian nationali\xad\nties was one of the main features of the \nMacedonian problem.\nA second feature was the rivalry be\xad\ntween Russia and Austria for predomi\xad\nnant influence in the Balkan Peninsula. \nBut in 1897, and again in 1903, these \ntwo States seemed to put aside their ri\xad\nvalry in the interests of humanity. They \npersuaded the other great powers to give \nthem a kind of mandatory authority to\nimpose upon the Sultan the so-called \nMiirzsteg Program of reforms for Mace\xad\ndonia. It included measures for improv\xad\ning the police, finance and administra\xad\ntion. But it would be tedious and un\xad\nprofitable to try to describe them and \nto explain the proposed modifications of \nthem during the succeeding years. Prob\xad\nably they reduced somewhat the annual \ntoll of assassinations. The figures re\xad\nported for 1908, the year o f the Young \nTurk Revolution, showed a decrease of \n30 per cent over the preceding year: \nTable of political assassinations in Mace\xad\ndonia reported during the year 1908 (V,\nwc\n(fq\nO\n(Dft)\nU1o•s\nO'\n< £  Q> O O M\nJew\ns.\nU2O\nK\no\n<“*-pP ** 3 o\nKilled by in to 3(12 •tto\nBulgars ....... 58 72 8 3 34 23 198\nPatriarchists .212 22 . 20 8 1 13 276\nSerbs ........... . 28 1 1 3 33\nVlachs ......... . 2 4 4 10\nMoslems ... . . 80 11 10 2 18 1 122\nUnknown ... .182 63 9 7 64 325\nSoldiers ....... 87 13 11 5 116\nTotals ....... .649 185 39 36 130 1 40 1,080\nOn the whole, however, the dismal con\xad\nclusion gathered from reading the hun\xad\ndred-odd pages on this subject is that the \nefforts at Macedonian reform were a \nghastly failure. Austria-Hungary and \nRussia did not execute their mandate \neither efficiently or sincerely, and the \nwily Sultan was able to interpose in\xad\nnumerable obstacles and delays. Ger\xad\nmany, convinced that reform was hope\xad\nless and unwilling to antagonize the Sul\xad\ntan by pressing him too vigorously to \ncarry out reforms, probably proved in \neffect to be an encouragement to him to \ndisregard the representations made to \nhim in the name of the great powers. \nThe French, mindful of their immense \ninvestments in Turkey (V, 174 ff.) , were \ninclined to be indifferent to reforms or \nat least to give them only lip-service; in \nfact the French Ambassador at Constan\xad\ntinople, M. Constans, was reported to be \nfond of making a remark to the effect \nthat he did not “ give a damn for Mace\xad\ndonia”  ( “Je me fiche de la Macedoine” ; \nV, 169). The British, on the other hand, \nwere sincere and urgent in pressing real \nreform. Again and again they pointed \nout the intolerable situation in Mace\xad\n", "118 CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1929\ndonia, with the constant refrain, “ Condi\xad\ntions will be worse next year unless \nsomething is done.” They thereby in\xad\ncurred odium at the Poi'te which was \ndetrimental to British commercial inter\xad\nests, which indeed were hesitant to in\xad\nvest funds in such a corrupt and rotten \nState. In all that relates to Macedonia \nSir Edward Grey shines out in the very \nbest light, sincerely anxious for im\xad\nprovement, ready to let other powers \nmake suggestions and go ahead if they \ncould accomplish anything, working to \npreserve harmony in the concert of Eu\xad\nrope, and wisely refusing to pass on \nrumors which might cause friction be\xad\ntween the great powers.\nMurder of Serb K ing\nOn June 11, 1903, King Alexander of \nSerbia, Queen Draga, and a number of \nSerbian officials were brutally murdered \nby a group of conspirators who placed \nPeter I. Karageorgevitch upon the blood\xad\nstained throne. Great Britain marked \nher abhorrence by withdrawing her Min\xad\nister three years from Belgrade, and by \nrefusing to recognize King Peter, until \nhe had reluctantly consented to dismiss \nsix of the regicide officers supposed to \nbe the leaders in the crime (V, 142). It \nis commonly said that two of the ring\xad\nleaders in this conspiracy were Tanko- \nsitch and Dmitri jevitch, the two officers \nwho became notorious for the aid they \ngave the three youths in Belgrade in \n1914 in the preparation of their plot to \nassassinate the Archduke Franz Ferdi\xad\nnand at Sarajevo. But it is worth not\xad\ning that the British Documents do not \nmention these two men in the list of six \nwhose dismissal was demanded on ac\xad\ncount of the 1903 crime.\nIn contrast to Great Britain’s right\xad\neous attitude, Russia and Austria-Hun\xad\ngary hastened to recognize Peter I, in \norder to establish a friendly influence at \nBelgrade. But the Dual Monarchy soon \ndestroyed whatever merit it thereby ac\xad\nquired by trying to bully Serbia into \ncontinuing to purchase war material \nfrom the famous Skoda works instead \nof from the Krupps or Schneider-Creu- \nsots, and by refusing to negotiate a com\xad\nmercial treaty unless Serbia yielded:\n“ No contract for guns, no commercial \ntreaty” (V, 148). This led to the tariff \nwar, or “ pig war,” which excluded Ser\xad\nbian pigs and prunes from Austria-Hun\xad\ngary, and caused great bitterness be\xad\ntween the two countries. It added fuel \nto the nationalist hatred with which Ser\xad\nbians regarded the Dual Monarchy’s op\xad\npression of Serbs in the coveted prov\xad\ninces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It \naiso brought to the front Serbia’s need \nof greater economic independence from \nAustria-Hungary, through the building \nof a railway from the Danube to the \nAdriatic, thus giving Serbia a free out\xad\nlet of her own to the sea.\nAdriatic Railw ay Question\nM. Pashitch, one of the leading Serbian \nstatesmen after 1903, was always great\xad\nly interested in this Adriatic railway \nproject. He saw not only its economic \nadvantage, but also its strategic and po\xad\nlitical value. It would thrust a barrier \nforward to block the Dual Monarchy’s \nadvance toward Salon ica, and it would \nhelp eventually to unite Montenegro, \nDalmatia and other South Slav lands \nwith the kingdom of Peter I into a glo\xad\nrious greater Serbia. On Nov. 17, 1904, \nafter declaring to the British Charge \nd’Affaires that “ he quite understood and \nsympathized with the horror excited in \nEngland by the murder of the King and \nQueen,”  Pashitch suggested the desira\xad\nbility of a railway to the Adriatic which \nhe would like to see built with British \ncapital. “ Such a line,”  he said, “ con\xad\ntinued as it undoubtedly would be \nthrough Serbia into Rumania, would be \nthe direct route for all the commerce of \nthe Balkans, and England with her sea\xad\ncarrying power could not fail to benefit, \neven if the railway through Turkey were \nnot, as might be the case, built with \nBritish capital” (V, 138). The British \nCharge was non-committal. But Pash\xad\nitch returned to the subject frequently, \nespecially after Aehrenthal put forward \nhis counter-project in January, 1908, for \nan intersecting Austrian railway from \nBosnia through the Sanjak of Novibazar \nto Mitrovitza; this would connect the \nAustrian railway system with the line \nrunning down the Vardar Valley to Sa-\n", 'SECRETS OF BRITISH PRE-WAR DIPLOMACY 119\nPublishers Photo Service\nMain street and business section of Pera, the Europeanized section of Constantinople. \nThe Turkish capital was an important centre of pre-war diplomacy and intrigue\nlonica, and would tend to cut Serbia off \nfrom political contact with Montenegro \nand Dalmatia (V, 321 ff.).\nSir Edward Grey assumed an attitude \nof impartiality between these two rival \nSerbian and Austrian railway schemes. \nHe “ was generally favorable to improved \nmeans of communication which encour\xad\naged trade,”  but he subordinated both \nprojects to the question of Macedonian \nreform (V, 322-356). He became very \nindignant at Aehrenthal, whom he sus\xad\npected of- having purchased the Sultan’s \npermission for the Sanjak Railway by \nbeing very lukewarm in urging reform in \nMacedonia. Aehrenthal protested that the \nsuspicion was without foundation. But \nas the concession for the railway coin\xad\ncided with the dropping of the Judicial \nReform Proposal, appearances seemed to \nbe against the Austrian Minister (V, \n225 ff., 334 ff.).\nGrey, to be sure, did ask the British \nBoard of Trade for their opinion about a \nSerbian railway to the Adriatic, but was \ninformed that the board did not antici\xad\npate that the proposed line would be\nlikely to be remunerative in the near fu\xad\nture, nor did they expect much benefit \nfrom it, at least at the outset, for British \ntrade. “ On the political side of the \nscheme (which seems more important \nthan the commercial aspect) the board \ndid not desire to offer observations”  (V, \n328).\nBy the Winter of 1907-08; especially \nafter Aehrenthal’s proposal of the San\xad\njak Railway and the coincident dropping \nof Judicial Reform, Grey was becoming \ndisgusted with the hypocrisy of the Con\xad\ntinental powers in pretending to urge \nMacedonian reform but In reality appar\xad\nently sacrificing it to their own special \nselfish interests. He was ready to wash \nhis hands of responsibility for the failure \nand let the public know the truth. As he \nwrote to the British Ambassador at Con\xad\nstantinople on Dec. 30, 1907 (V, 222) :\nI am not prepared to break up the Con\xad\ncert, but neither am I willing to pretend \nin Parliament that the powers are going \nto do something, when they are not.\nAnd again on Feb. 10, 1908 (V, 228):\nAustria has played the mean game of \ndriving a bargain with the Porte in favor \nof her railway scheme at the expense of\n', '1 2 0 CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1929\nMacedonian reform. It seems, now, that \nwe are to be in the position of having \nall the odium at Constantinople of press\xad\ning reforms, while other members of the \nConcert curry favor with the Porte by ob\xad\nstructing them.\nX regard this as making me free to say \nwhatever I please on the subject. If there \nwas any prospect of improving matters \nin Macedonia by holding my peace, there \nwould be a reason for my doing so; but \nthere is none. * * *\nI intend to publish a Blue Book [which \nhe presented to Parliament a month later, \nafter a speech on the subject, to the no \nlittle annoyance of Aehrenthalj.\nR u s s ia ’ s F ear of A u stria n  P l a n s\nAehrenthal’s Sanjak railway proposal \nstruck Izvolski “ like a bomb between the \nlegs.” It roused a loud Pan-Slav outcry \nin Russia. The press feared it would \ngreatly increase Austrian influence in \nthe Balkans to Russia’s disadvantage, \nand therefore denounced it as a treason\xad\nable abandonment of the Austro-Russian \n•agreements from 1907 onwards in favor \nof cooperation between the two countries \non equal terms for the preservation of \nthe status quo in the Balkans. The Slav \npress demanded vehemently that Russia \non her part should now abandon coopera\xad\ntion with the Dual Monarchy, and should \njoin more closely with Great Britain in \nthe Macedonian question. As the British \nAmbassador at St. Petersburg, Sir Ar\xad\nthur Nicolson, wrote to Sir Edward Grey \non Feb. 18, 1908 (V, 232):\nThere is a deep-rooted conviction that a \ncontinued cooperation with Austria-Hun\xad\ngary and Germany, for these two powers \nare considered as identical, in Balkan \nquestions must inevitably lead to a sacri\xad\nfice of Slav interests, and that Russia \nwould then have played the unworthy \npart of a dupe. Confidence in the sin\xad\ncerity of Austria-Hungary has been de\xad\nstroyed, and even in authoritative quar\xad\nters it is considered that the two above- \nnamed powers are carrying into execution \na prearranged plan by which Austria, \nthough still simulating a desire to pro\xad\nmote reforms, seizes the opportunity to \nsecure for herself special advantages, \nwhile Germany undertakes the duty of \nblocking reforms and of keeping the \nPorte in a good humor, in order that both \nher projects and those of Austria may be \nfavorably considered by the Sultan.\nIzvolski was at this time Russian Min\xad\nister for Foreign Affairs. He possessed \na brilliant intellect and diplomatic fi\xad\nnesse, but was excessively vain, ambi\xad\ntious, intriguing, snobbish, and not al\xad\nways truthful. He was a direct contrast \nto his predecessor, Count Lamsdorf, a \nnobleman of the fine old type, more so\xad\nlicitous for his country than for himself, \nprudent to the point of imprudence, hon\xad\nest but not brilliant; Lamsdorf had care\xad\nfully refrained from plunging his coun\xad\ntry into any adventurous Balkan policy, \nespecially in view of the complications \nand exhaustion caused by the war with \nJapan. A  shrewd Russian jurist, com\xad\nparing the two men, recently observed \nthat Lamsdorf resembled a precious, \nantique goblet of chased gold filled with \npoor lemonade; while Izvolski was like a \nquart of the finest champagne presented \nin a coarse imitation of a Benvenuto Cel\xad\nlini cup.\nIn view of the clamor of the Russian \npress, and in accord with his own ambi\xad\ntious designs for winning back in the \nNear East the prestige which Russia had \nlost in the Far East, Izvolski now saw \nthe opportunity of drawing still closer to \nGreat Britain and thereby obtaining her \nsupport in the Balkans. He at once re\xad\nvived and championed Pashitch’s scheme \nfor an Adriatic railway which should \nblock at right angles, or at least counter\xad\nbalance, Aehrenthal’s Sanjak railway \ntoward Salonica. And he welcomed the \nvisit which Edward VII proposed to pay \nto the Czar at Reval in June, 1908. He \npretended to Nicolson and the British \nthat he was all zeal for Macedonian re\xad\nform. But when Grey proposed to win \nthe Sultan to reform by offering to \nguarantee the territorial integrity of \nMacedonia, Izvolski showed the cloven \nhoof by refusing. “ He shook his head \nover guaranteeing the integrity and ex\xad\nternal security of those parts of the Sul\xad\ntan’s dominions. He seemed to think that \nthis would be assuming a responsibility \nwhich, in certain circumstances, it might \nbe inconvenient and indeed difficult to \ndischarge,”  as Nicolson reported to Grey \n(V, 233).\nEdward VII at Reval\nHowever, Edward VII visited the Czar \nat Reval on June 9 and 10, 1908, as \nplanned. It was given out that the main \nobject of the visit was the discussion of \nMacedonian reform—and incidentally the\n', 'SECRETS OF BRITISH PRE-WAR DIPLOMACY 121\nstrengthening of the rapprochement \nwhich had been established by the Anglo- \nRussian Entente of 1907 concerning Per\xad\nsia and the Middle East. He was ac\xad\ncompanied by Sir Charles Hardinge rep\xad\nresenting the Foreign Office, as well as \nby Sir John French and Sir John Fisher \nrepresenting the army and navy. There \nwere long conversations between them \nand the corresponding Russian officers, \nincluding M. Stolypin, the president of \nthe Russian Council, and Izvolski, which \nwere summed up in a report by Har\xad\ndinge (V, 237-245).\nGermany became gravely suspicious \nand nervous as to the import of these \nReval conversations. Although she was \nrepeatedly assured that no secret agree\xad\nments had been made, the Kaiser imag\xad\nined more than ever that he was being \n“encircled,”  and that “ Uncle Bertie” was \nintriguing against him. Thus the Reval \nmeeting did much to poison further An\xad\nglo-German relations, which were al\xad\nready seriously strained by Germany’s \nrapid naval construction.\nT h e  Y o u n g  T u r k  Question\nPossibly another effect of the Reval \nmeeting was the hastening of the out\xad\nbreak of the Young Turk Revolution, of \nwhich the British documents give a very \ngood account, taken from the private \npapers of Sir Edward Grey and the Brit\xad\nish representatives in Constantinople (V, \n247-320). Grey was very sympathetic \nwith a movement which he hoped would \nput an end to Abdul Hamid’s corrupt and \ncruel despotism, and open the way for \nreal reforms and also for British com\xad\nmercial interests. He welcomed the \nYoung Turk Revolution, but he saw dan\xad\ngers ahead:\nIf the Turks are really going to make \na good job of their own affairs, our en\xad\ncouragement and support will be very \nfirm, and we shall deprecate any inter\xad\nference from outside on the part of \nothers. * * *\nBut if Turkey now establishes a Parlia\xad\nment and improves her government, the \ndemand for a constitution in Egypt will \ngain great force, and our power of resist\xad\ning the demand will be very much di\xad\nminished. * * * The position will be very \nawkward. * * * and will require careful \nhandling. ♦ ♦ *\nThe Young Turks should not try to go\ntoo fast; if they do they may either create \nconfusion or provoke reaction. The first \nimportant thing is to get the government \ninto the hands of honest and capable \nmen: if they do that the rest will fol\xad\nlow. * * *\nWe shall hope and expect British capi\xad\ntal to be given good opportunities; but \nwe shall not support it in demanding \nonerous or unsound terms (V, 263-267).\nI zvolski a n d  t h e  States\nImmediately after the Reval meeting \nIzvolski seems to have concluded that the \nmoment had come to achieve a brilliant \nstroke of diplomacy which would in\xad\ncrease Russia’s influence in the Balkans \nand enhance his own reputation. He \nwanted to secure a free passage for Rus\xad\nsian warships through the Straits of the \nBosphorus and the Dardanelles and do \naway with old treaties which forbade \nthis. Did he receive encouragement at \nReval that the British, who had been \nchiefly instrumental in originating and \ncontinuing the closure o f the Straits, \nwould now no longer oppose his fond \nplan? There is not a word in Hardinge’s \nlong account of the Reval conversations \n(V, 237-245) to indicate that he did. On \nthe other hand, there exists an explicit \nstatement that precisely this encourage\xad\nment was given at Reval, and Izvolski \nduring the next six months acted as if \nhe had received it.\nIn the private diary of A. A. Polovtsev, \na member of the Council of the Empire, \nwhose notes are usually distinguished by \nprecise and sound information, there oc\xad\ncurs this significant entry on May 30- \nJune 13, that is, three days after the \nReval meeting: “ At the Council [of the \nEmpire] it was stated that at the inter\xad\nview of the two monarchs Edward prom\xad\nised to our Emperor to obtain for our \nfleet the opening of a free passage \nthrough the Dardanelles.”  Krasnyi Ark- \nhiv, IV, 128).\nIzvolski knew that Aehrenthal would \nnot consent to the opening of the Straits \nunless Austria-Hungary received some \nequivalent advantage. Therefore three \nweeks later, on July 2, in connection \nwith the discussion of the Adriatic and \nSanjak railways, Izvolski sent Aehren\xad\nthal a secret memoir in which he hinted \nat a mutually advantageous arrangement\n', '122 CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1929\nat Turkey’s expense before the Young \nTurks had had time to consolidate their \nnewly won power: Austria might annex \nBosnia and Herzegovina, and Russia \nshould have free passage for her war\xad\nships through the Straits. This was the \nsubstance of the bargain later made by \nIzvolski and Aehrenthal in their famous \nmeeting at Buchlau in mid-September. \nFrom Buchlau, Izvolski started on a lei\xad\nsurely tour to inform Italy, France and \nGreat Britain of the Buchlau bargain, \nand to secure their definite assent to it. \nHe apparently did not expect to have \nany serious difficulty. Meanwhile Aeh\xad\nrenthal stole a march on him. He quick\xad\nly proclaimed the annexation of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, and so pocketed safely \nhis half of the Buchlau deal just as Iz\xad\nvolski arrived at Paris. Izvolski was \nfurious at this Austrian action, which he \nhad not expected to take place so soon. \nHe still hoped to secure his half of the \nbargain just the same. But when he \nreached London he was utterly dismayed \nto find that Grey would not consent to it.\nGrey personally perhaps would have \nbeen willing to approve Izvolski’s pro\xad\nposal for opening the Straits, provided \nthe annulment of the treaties concerned \nwas sanctioned by a European Confer\xad\nence; but he could not persuade the \nwhole Cabinet, and he feared that Brit\xad\nish public opinion would not approve it. \nFurthermore, he was indignant that \nAehrenthal should tear up a clause in \nthe Treaty of Berlin by annexing Bosnia \nwithout consulting the other signatory \npowers. And in spite of Izvolski’s none \ntoo veracious account of the Buchlau \nbargain (V, 361 f., 367 f., 375, 382 ff.) \nGrey felt that Izvolski had probably been \nto some extent an accomplice of Aehren\xad\nthal. Therefore Grey refused to assent \nto Izvolski’s proposal for opening the \nStraits, though he suggested other pos\xad\nsibilities which Izvolski did not care to \naccept. As Hardinge wrote to Nicolson: \n“ Izvolski came down this afternoon and \nreceived this verdict with great dejec\xad\ntion. He went away thoroughly miser\xad\nable” (V, 435).\nWhat Did Edward VII Do?\nWe are brought back to the question, \nDid Edward VII at Reval encourage \nRussia to expect British support for the \nopening of the Straits? Apparently he \ndid, judging by Polovtsev’s diary, Izvol\xad\nski’s memoir and bargain with Aehren\xad\nthal, and by his surprise and utter dejec\xad\ntion upon receiving Grey’s unfavorable \nverdict in London. It is also to be noted \nthat Edward VII wrote to Asquith while \nIzvolski was in London, saying that \nGreat Britain was bound to give way on \nthe Straits if she wished to retain Rus\xad\nsian friendship, and hoping the Cabi\xad\nnet would look at the question from a \nEuropean and international view and not \nfrom merely a domestic one (Sidney Lee, \nEdward VII, II, 640). Such an attitude \nwould be natural if he had encouraged \nthe Russians a few months before at \nReval. On the other hand, it is quite \npossible that the entry in Polovtsev’s \ndiary rests on false information given by \nIzvolski, who was thereby to win ap\xad\nproval for his scheme by indicating that \nit would not meet with British opposi\xad\ntion. And if he had really received some \npromise at Reval, it is surprising that he \ndid not bring up this fact on his visit to \nLondon when pleading with Grey. On \nthe whole, therefore, it is perhaps more \nlikely that Izvolski was guilty of sug- \ngestio falsi at the meeting of the Russian \nCouncil than that Hardinge wSs guilty \nof stip2rressio veri in saying nothing of \nthis matter in his long and detailed ac\xad\ncount of the Reval meeting.\nThe last part o f the volume contains a \ndetailed account of the long negotiations \nin connection with the Bosnian annexa\xad\ntion crisis; they give many evidences of \nGrey’s growing suspicions of Austria \nand Germany and of his increasing sym\xad\npathy with Russia, feelings which were \nheld even more strongly by Nicolson, \nHardinge and King Edward himself.\n']</pre>
