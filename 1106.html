        <pre>['Current History\nM A Y , 1985 V O L . 84, N O . 502\nIn this issue, eight specialists examine the problemsfaced by the various governments o f  the \nNorth African nations as well as United States policies in that area. A s  our introductory article \npoints out, “Strategic and political interests are most important to Washington in its relations \nwith the Arab states o f  North Africa because the Reagan administration gives a very high \npriority to the global-strategic competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. ”\nUnited States Relations with North Africa\nB y  Jo h n  D amis\nProfessor of Political Science, Portland State University\nW\nith the occasional exception of Libya, the \narea of North Africa does not command \nfront-page attention in the United States. \nThere is even some confusion about the true identity of \nthe region: Is it part of Africa? Or, by dint of its cultural \norientation— predominantly Arab and Muslim— does it \nbelong to the Middle East?\nFor many years after World W ar II, American rela\xad\ntions with North Africa were handled within the Depart\xad\nment of State’s Bureau of African Affairs. When Secretary \nof State Henry Kissinger made a trip to the Arab world \nand Israel shortly after the October, 1973, Arab—Israeli \nwar, he visited Morocco and Tunisia as well as the \nconfrontation states of the Middle East. Kissinger ex\xad\npressed consternation that this trip required the presence \nof not one but two assistant secretaries of state. This \nconsternation reportedly led to an administrative reorga\xad\nnization in which responsibility for relations with the \nNorth African countries was transfered to the State De\xad\npartment’s Bureau for Near Eastern and South Asian \nAffairs. In  the eyes of a senior American diplomat, North \nAfrica ceased to be the crown jewel of the African Bureau \nand became instead the backwater of the Near E ast- \nSouth Asian Bureau.\nTo be sure, the countries of the western Arab world \n(known collectively as the Maghreb) have important \nlinks to both Africa and the Middle East. The regional \nconflicts of this area— the Western Sahara and Chad—  \nare on the agenda, first and foremost, of an African \ngrouping, the Organization of African Unity (OAU). At \nthe same time, the region’s strong religious, linguistic and \npolitical ties are with the Arab East.\nFor the United States, the Maghreb has greater \nstrategic importance than west, central, east or even\nsouthern Africa. For obvious reasons, North Africa has \nconsiderably less importance for American interests than \nthe Middle East— thus the “backwater” image. In  North \nAfrica, the United States has important and close rela\xad\ntions with Morocco, important but not so close relations \nwith Algeria, close but not so important relations with \nTunisia, and severely strained relations with Libya. \nFinally, the United States has an interest in Chad that \nderives primarily from American relations with neighbor\xad\ning Libya, Egypt, and Sudan.\nMOROCCO\nThe United States, beginning in the late 1960’s when \nMoroccan relations with France were badly strained, has \nbuilt up a close political relationship with Morocco. Be\xad\ncause of Morocco’s strategic position commanding the \nsouthern access to the Mediterranean, Washington has a \nvested interest in a friendly government in Rabat. \nWashington and the moderate government of King Has- \nsan I I  share much the same assessment of the destabiliz\xad\ning potential of the Soviet Union and Cuba in Africa. \nKing Hassan helped arrange and initially supported \nEgyptian President Anwar Sadat’s peace efforts with \nIsrael before falling in line with the general Arab condem\xad\nnation of the 1979 Egyptian—Israeli peace treaty. In  \nJanuary, 1984, at a summit meeting of the Islamic Con\xad\nference Organization held in Casablanca, the King \nplayed a key role in the decision to allow Egypt to return \nto the conference. Hassan dispatched troops in 1977 and \n1978 to help repel invasions of Zaire’s mineral-rich Shaba \nprovince by Angola-based rebels. Until 1978, the United \nStates maintained a naval training facility at Kenitra and \ntwo navy communications installations northeast of \nRabat that served as important relay stations for facilities\n', '194 CURRENT HISTORY, MAY, 1985\nin the eastern Mediterranean. In  addition, Moroccan \nports are generally open to visits by ships of the American \nSixth Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean, and in De\xad\ncember, 1984, a large Marine Corps tank carrier, the \nU.S.S. Newport, made a six-day visit to the port of Casa\xad\nblanca.\nIn contrast, American—Moroccan commercial rela\xad\ntions are modest. The United States accounts for only 4 to \n6 percent of Morocco’s foreign trade. Because of the \nimportance of the French language in Morocco’s com\xad\nmercial life, the country’s imports have long centered on \nFrench products. In  addition, there is very little com\xad\nplementarity between the American and Moroccan econ\xad\nomies. Morocco’s major export is agricultural produce \nand the kingdom is the world’s largest exporter of phos\xad\nphates, whereas the United States is the world’s largest \nagricultural exporter and the largest producer of phos\xad\nphates.\nThe United States also has an important military \nsupply relationship with Morocco, although France re\xad\nmains the kingdom’s primary source of arms. During the \npast decade, Morocco has signed agreements to purchase \nmore than $800-million worth of arms from the United \nStates under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, \nplus nearly $ 100-million worth of commercial arms. The \nFMS deliveries have included M-48 and M-60 tanks and \nF-5 jet fighters. In  addition, Rabat signed a three-year, \n$220-million contract with Westinghouse in 1977 to pro\xad\nvide a system of air defense radar installations, a support\xad\ning communications system, and a control tower.\nDuring the administration of President Jimmy Garter, \nthe arms supply relationship became strained when \nWashington and Rabat had serious policy disagreements \nover the proper use of American-supplied weapons. The \nproblem centered on the Western Sahara, which Rabat \nconsiders to be part of Morocco. Since the United States \ndid not recognize Moroccan sovereignty in the Western \nSahara, the Carter administration took the position that \nMorocco could not use American-supplied arms in\xad\ntended for internal security and legitimate self-defense in \nthe disputed territory. In  1978, the Garter administration \nimposed arms sales restrictions on Morocco. King Has- \nsan made it clear to Washington at that time that con\xad\ntinued American military aid was the price of Moroccan \nfriendship.1\nThe strain in relations ended in 1979 when the \nPolisario— the Popular Front for the Liberation of Sakiet \nal-Hamra and Rio de Oro, the two sections of the West\xad\nern Sahara— began to launch attacks inside Morocco. \nThe Garter administration concluded that Morocco, a \ntrusted and supportive ally, faced a  threat to its internal \nsecurity, and it approved a $235-million arms package \neagerly sought by Rabat. In  defending this arms package \nin Congress in January, 1980, the Carter administration\n1 Richard B. Parker, North Africa: Regional Tensions and Strategic \nConcerns (New York: Praeger, 1984), p. 177. Parker was the \nAmerican ambassador to Morocco in 1978-1979.\nidentified the avoidance of a Moroccan military defeat in \nthe Sahara as a major United States interest. Congres\xad\nsional critics of the sale made the completion of the arms \ntransfers conditional on Morocco’s good-faith efforts to \nreach a negotiated political solution in the Western \nSahara.\nWhen it came to power in 1981, the administration of \nPresident Ronald Reagan removed the limitation on \narms sales to Morocco and greatly expanded bilateral \nmilitary and security cooperation. Only one day after \ncoming into office, the Reagan administration approved \nMorocco’s pending request for 180 M-60A3 main battle \ntanks— a request the Garter administration had shelved \nin November, 1980, to avoid offending Algeria, which \nhad begun to play its crucial intermediary role in the \nhostage crisis with Iran. In  late 1981, when Morocco \nrequested additional military assistance from the United \nStates to counter Soviet-made SA-6 missile systems intro\xad\nduced into battle by the Polisario, the United States \nagreed to provide Morocco with various measures to \ncounter the SA-6 missiles, including training in evasive \nflying tactics and electronic countermeasures equipment.\nAmerican—Moroccan military and security coopera\xad\ntion reached a new level in 1982 with the establishment of \na joint military commission in February and the signing \nof a facilities access agreement in May, following King \nHassan’s official state visit to Washington. The renew\xad\nable six-year agreement allows United States military \nplanes to use two Moroccan air bases during emergencies \nin the Middle East and Africa. These transit rights, which \nwould allow American planes to land and refuel, were \nsought for use by the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) \nthen being planned for the Middle East. Morocco re\xad\nportedly retained a veto over the transit of United States \nforces if they were to be used against an Arab country \nfriendly to Morocco. Because of Moroccan sensitivity on \nthe subject, the agreement was not made public.\nHeightened military cooperation has been accompa\xad\nnied by higher levels of American financial assistance. \nThe joint military commission and the facilities access \nagreement brought in their wake an increase in military \nsales credits for Morocco from $30 million in fiscal year \n1982 to $100 million in fiscal year 1983. American mili\xad\ntary assistance to Morocco in all categories totaled over \n$150 million for fiscal year 1984. When $244 million of \nagricultural credits, a $ 150-million investment for ex\xad\npanding Voice of America facilities in Tangier, and $40 \nmillion to upgrade the two airports involved in the facili\xad\nties access agreement are included, total American finan\xad\ncial assistance for Morocco in fiscal year 1984 approached \n$600 million.\nUnited States relations with Morocco were jolted last \nsummer when Hassan and Libyan leader Muammar \nQaddafi suddenly signed an agreement establishing an \n“Arab-African Union” in which each state retains its \nsovereignty. The treaty calls for close economic, social \nand political cooperation. In  the United States, vocal\n', 'U n ited  S tates R elations w ith  N orth  A frica  • 195\nmembers of Congress and the media, and especially \nstrong supporters of Israel, sharply criticized Rabat’s \nsurprise move as a betrayal and a failure of American \ndiplomacy. To allay United States concern, King Hassan \ndispatched Ahmed Reda Guedira, his top adviser, to \nWashington, where he met in early September with Vice \nPresident George Bush. Later that month, State Depart\xad\nment troubleshooter General Vernon Walters (who was \nappointed in February to replace Jeane Kirkpatrick as \npermanent representative to the United Nations) met \nwith King Hassan in Fez. In Washington and in Fez, \nMorocco tried to convince the United States that it could \nexercise a restraining influence on Qaddafi.\nWithin a couple of months, the furor in Washington \nover Morocco’s unity agreement with Libya had all but \ndisappeared. The Reagan administration chose to take a \nwait-and-see position; • instead of lashing out against \nMorocco, it merely warned Rabat not to trust Qaddafi. \nWith the exception of Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan of New York, no voices were raised in Con\xad\ngress against the unity agreement at any point in the \ndeliberations over foreign military and economic assis\xad\ntance, and Morocco received full funding of its FMS and \neconomic requests for fiscal year 1985.\nUnited States relations with Morocco have apparently \nnot changed in any significant way as a result of the \nunexpected unity pact. Judging from Libya’s previous \nfailures at unity attempts with other Arab states, the \nMoroccan—Libyan union will probably not be im\xad\nplemented fully. In particular, it is highly unlikely that \nLibya will ever control American military equipment \nsupplied to Morocco. Libya already has more Soviet and \nFrench weaponry than it needs, and Libyans lack the \ntraining necessary to use American arms. In addition, \nRabat will be very wary of jeopardizing its arms supply \nrelationship with Washington by transferring American \nweapons to Libya. And to the extent that Rabat is able to \nmoderate Qaddafi’s extremist tendencies, Morocco’s uni\xad\nty agreement with Libya could support United States \nnational security interests.\nIt is the Western Sahara dispute that will weigh heavily \non United States relations with Morocco. Washington \nhas tried to avoid any direct involvement in the Sahara \nconflict, which it views as a regional issue requiring a \nregional solution. The Reagan administration has been \nresponsive to Rabat’s legitimate needs for national de\xad\nfense; it has given Morocco enough support to defend \nitself and to encourage negotiations but not enough to \noverrun the Polisario. The United States has no interests \nin the Western Sahara and it has no preferred solution for \nthe conflict; at the same time, the United States is anxious \nto avoid a Moroccan defeat that could threaten the stabil\xad\nity of the monarchy.\nALGERIA\nUnited States relations with Algeria are the reverse of \nthose with Morocco. Because of its successful anti\xad\ncolonial revolution, Algeria is highly respected in the \nthird world and is, among North African countries, by far \nthe most influential in the international arena. It is a \nstrong supporter of national liberation movements in \ngeneral and the Polisario in particular. Its economic \norientation is socialist, and it was an architect in 1974 of \nthe New International Economic Order. From Algiers, \nthe United States is seen as the most powerful capitalist \ncountry in the world and the leader of the “haves” on \nNorth—South issues. More often than not, the United \nStates and Algeria are diametrically opposed on interna\xad\ntional political and economic issues. Political relations \nbetween the two countries, therefore, are correct but not \nclose.\nBut because Algerians do not mix politics and econom\xad\nics, large-scale commercial relations have developed be\xad\ntween the United States and Algeria dining the past \ndecade. In  1977, the United States replaced France as \nAlgeria’s principal trading partner and absorbed nearly \nhalf of Algeria’s exports, including 56 percent of Algeria’s \ncrude oil and 28 percent of its liquefied natural gas. The \nvalue of Algerian imports to the United States reached a \nhigh of $6.6 billion in 1980 and oil imports peaked at \n500,000 barrels a day in January, 1981. There have been \nno imports of Algerian crude oil since February, 1982, but \nlarge amounts of condensate, or natural gasoline, have \nbeen imported.\nAlgerian natural gas also has made important inroads \nin the American market, although deliveries under a \nmajor contract were halted in 1980 because of a price \ndisagreement. Algeria insists that the price of its gas be \ntied to that of crude oil; this makes Algerian gas consider\xad\nably more expensive than gas imported from Canada. \n(The United States Department of Energy refuses to \napprove contracts at the higher price, and shipments \nunder a second major contract were suspended in De\xad\ncember, 1983.) Completing this commercial relationship, \nsince the mid-1970’s American firms have signed con\xad\ntracts worth between $6 billion and $8 billion with Alge\xad\nrian state-owned companies to provide technology and \nconstruction for Algeria’s extensive development efforts.\nUnited States relations with Algeria have improved \nsince the more moderate regime of Chedli Benjedid took \noffice in early 1979. These relations have benefited from \nAlgeria’s displeasure with the massive Soviet intervention \nin Afghanistan. The Soviet invasion and brutalization of \na Muslim country encouraged Algiers to distance itself \nsomewhat from Moscow and to seek better relations and \nalternate sources of military supplies from both the \nUnited States and France. This factor partly explains \nAlgeria’s willingness in 1980—1981 to play an effective \nmediating role in ending the hostage crisis between the \nUnited States and Iran. The first American naval visit to \nan Algerian port in 17 years took place in 1980, a year that \nbrought the first invitation to Algerian military officers to \nvisit the United States.\nNonetheless, the improvement in American—Algerian\n', '196 CURRENT HISTORY, MAY, 1985\nrelations has been slow and uneven. At the time of the \nhostage crisis, Algerian leaders expressed their desire for \nbetter and closer relations with the United States. They \nwere resentful, however, when the Reagan administra\xad\ntion approved a major tank sale to Morocco as one of its \nfirst foreign policy moves. Since that time, the Reagan \nadministration has tried to be more responsive and sensi\xad\ntive to Algeria’s continuing evolution from revolutionary \npolicies to relative international maturity. Between 1981 \nand 1984, Washington allowed the sale to Algeria of a \ntotal of 17 Lockheed C-130 Hercules military transport \nplanes worth about $300 million. In  addition, between \n1981 and 1983, the Algerian military purchased 4,000 \nheavy-duty trucks from American Motors. Nevertheless, \nthe United States maintains a policy of not selling lethal \nmilitary equipment to Algeria, a policy that dates from \nthe late 19605s when the more radical regime of Houari \nBoumedienne granted safe haven for airplane hijackers \nand terrorists.\nOne impediment to improved relations is the lingering \nperception— more prevalent in Congress than in the ex\xad\necutive branch—-that Algeria is a Soviet client This \nperception derives from the former strident tone of Alge\xad\nria’s anti-imperialist rhetoric, the frequent identity of \nAlgerian and Soviet positions on international issues, and \nthe fact that Moscow has supplied about 90 percent of \nAlgeria’s military equipment. The notion that Algiers is \nin the Soviet camp has been a factor in the disagreement \nover gas prices, since there is some American concern \nabout the reliability of Algeria as a long-term supplier of a \nvital energy source.\nBut the image of Algeria as a Soviet client state is a \ngross misperception. Algeria is a fiercely independent \ncountry that categorically refuses to be beholden to any \noutside power; it has not permitted Soviet bases on its \nterritory, although Soviet vessels are allowed to make \nport calls. The Benjedid regime complained bitterly in \nprivate when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, \nThough Algiers has abstained on the annual United \nNations General Assembly resolutions calling for the \nwithdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, it voted in \nDecember, 1984, in favor of a resolution by the Organiza\xad\ntion of Islamic Conference condemning the Soviet Union \nand calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from \nAfghanistan.\nThe improvement in American—Algerian relations has \nbeen most noticeable in the past two years. Algeria was \nmade eligible in April, 1983, to purchase defense ser\xad\nvices— that is, training— from the United States. \nThough nothing concrete has yet materialized, the Alge\xad\nrians are interested in purchasing defense services and \nagreements between the two governments will probably \nbe reached in 1985. Algeria would like to be eligible for \nFMS, which requires a presidential determination. The \nAlgerians do not need the credits involved in the FMS \nprogram, but their inclusion on the FMS fist would con\xad\nstitute an American mark of approval.\nIn  September, 1983, Vice President Bush became the \nhighest ranking American official ever to visit Algiers. \nDespite the disagreement over natural gas prices, Algiers \nwould like to expand economic contacts with the United \nStates in other areas. Secretary of Agriculture John Block \nvisited Algeria in February, 1984, to sign the first agri\xad\ncultural aid agreement between the two countries. In \nNovember, Secretary of Energy Donald Hodel (who has \nsince become secretary of the interior) attended the thir\xad\ntieth anniversary celebrations of the launching of the \nAlgerian Revolution. Hodel extended an invitation for a \nstate visit to President Benjedid, and in February the \nWhite House announced that the Algerian President \nwould make a one-week visit to the United States in \nApril. Except for a quick side trip from the United Na\xad\ntions by President Boumedienne in 1974, the Benjedid \nvisit marks the first time an Algerian leader has come to \nWashington since Algerian independence in 1962.\nThese developments reflect a perception by the Reagan \nadministration that the Benjedid regime has adopted \nmore reserved and responsible positions on Middle East \nissues; that it is no longer an active member of the radical \nArab “Steadfastness Front”; and that it has made active \nefforts to end the Iran—Iraq war. Communications be\xad\ntween the governments have improved and American \nofficials have friendly access to Algerian officials.\nTUNISIA\nUnited States relations with Tunisia have always been \nfriendly. A small country with modest resources sur\xad\nrounded by larger and more powerful neighbors, Tunisia \nnecessarily seeks to avoid disputes. The pragmatic gov\xad\nernment of President Habib Bourguiba, who has been \nfirmly in power since independence in 1956, has looked to \nthe United States (and France) for development assis\xad\ntance and occasional shows of force against neighboring \nLibya, Though Washington has no economic stake in \nTunisia, it wants to assist the most moderate and stable \ncountry in the Arab world. At the geostrategic level, a \nstrong Tunisia helps to maintain stability along the coast \nof North Africa to protect the southern flank of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nBefore 1980, the United States mainly provided Tuni\xad\nsia with economic assistance since Bourguiba kept his \ncountry’s military down to a very modest size. Total \nUnited States economic aid to Tunisia since 1956 is over \n$1 billion; American officials have often cited Tunisia as a \nmodel of successful aid-assisted economic development.\nBourguiba’s sensible approach to internal develop\xad\nment was overtaken by national security concerns in 1980 \n(Continued on page 232)\nJohn Damis is the author of many articles on North \nAfrica and Conflict in Northwest Africa: The Western Sahara \nDispute (Stanford, Calif.: Hoover Institution Press, 1983). \nHe formerly served as the Department of State’s foreign \naffairs analyst for North Africa.\n', "232 CURRENT HISTORY, MAY, 1985\n$500 million a year by 1989, oil revenues are regarded as \nthe country’s major chance to stave off economic collapse.\nRETRENCHMENT\nAlthough these crises are rooted in separate circum\xad\nstances, each of them has been worsened by and has \nbecome part of the Islamic program. Institutional opposi\xad\ntion to the Islamic program first sprang, surprisingly, \nfrom the elected People’s Assembly, which delayed inde\xad\nfinitely its vote on Nimeiry’s constitutional amendments \nin July, 1984, fearing a full-scale civil war. Not surprising\xad\nly, most Sudanese remained unconvinced that their \nrather pedantic leader should derive his authority from \nthe Koran.\nThe constitutional delay proved crucial, because it \nbroke the momentum of the program. I t  was also reassur\xad\ning, because it revealed a Sudanese pragmatism that \nworked to restrain Nimeiry’s powers. In  an abrupt \nchange of tactics recalling his former skill, Nimeiry \npledged to exempt the south from Islamic law and allow it \nto reunify. A week later, he dismantled the Islamic courts \nand promised further “radical changes.”\nThe action was, however, too litde and too late. The \npowerful forces behind the Sudan’s religious and cultural \ndiversity had found definition in the traumatic events of \n1984. Despite his experience, it is doubtful that Nimeiry \nwill be able to mend those cleavages. The year left \nNimeiry weakened, his credibility damaged and his sup\xad\nport seriously eroded both in the south and the north, \namong Muslims and non-Muslims. His execution of \nTaha in January, 1985, suggested that he would react \nwith increasing violence to perceived threats.\nThus the Sudan’s future is bleak. As long as Nimeiry \nretains the army’s loyalty, he will stay in power. In  any \ncase, there is no obvious leader to take his place. The era \nof reconciliation has become the era of perpetual crisis, \nand the long-suffering Sudanese will have to endure until \na new leader can begin the long, slow trek toward nation\xad\nal unity. ■\nC H A D\n(Continued from page 212)\nGUNT. Goukhouni’s Forces Armees Populaires (FAP), \nconsisting of Toubou followers from the days of the \nCCFAN, remain a key element. Goukhouni has been \nchallenged frequently by Acheikh Ibn Oumar, the leader \nof the CDR. Considered closest to Libya, the CDR is also \nthe strongest fighting unit. Finally, there is Mahamat \nAbba Said, whose First Army has become the Forces \nPopulaires de la Liberation. There is little evidence that \nthese groups will ever align with Habre. Mistrust runs too \ndeep and Habre suspects that as long as they remain \nmilitarily beholden to Libyan backing these groups will \nbe entirely subject to Qaddafi’s shifting whims.\nHabre must maneuver within the framework of south\xad\nern politics. The south’s cotton crop is Chad’s financial \nlifeline. As long as Habre is denied direct access to the\ncotton revenue of the south, he is deprived of revenue. \nGiven the continuing disorder in the south, farmers do \nnot deal directly with the cotton trading monopoly, \nCotonchad; they prefer to sell produce to individual trad\xad\ners traveling from Cameroon or the Central African Re\xad\npublic. Southern administrators are essential to the run\xad\nning of the country. With almost 60 percent of the budget \ndevoted to defense, the government is desperate to resolve \nits southern problem.\nThere is a double pressure because famine has struck \nmuch of the country. Not only is Chad wracked by famine \nbut many who are affected cannot be reached with relief. \nSufferers do not move toward the capital to seek assis\xad\ntance; they migrate to the east to Sudan and to the \nsouthern prefectures, reflecting Chad’s historic economic \npatterns.\nDuring Chad’s civil war, there has been almost no \naction on economic recovery. The premise that economic \nassistance— without which Chad can barely rebuild \nitself—must be predicated on a political settlement has \nproved singularly inappropriate. A major program of \neconomic assistance, equitably distributed and designed \nto restore public services and to centralize commercial \nactivity, would be a major incentive for cooperation. The \nUnited Nations appealed for $250 million in 1982 for the \nrehabilitation of Chad. The response was negligible, and \nthere has been little effort since to promote such a pro\xad\ngram. Thus the government lives, in effect, from hand to \nmouth, dependent partly on excise taxes raised on local \ntrade near the capital and on insufficient foreign assis\xad\ntance from donors like the United States and France. \nMeanwhile, the solution to Chad’s crisis is as distant as \never. ■\nU N I T E D  S T A T E S  R E L A T IO N S  W IT H  \nN O R T H  A F R IC A\n(Continued from page 196)\nwhen Libya organized an armed attack against the'Tuni- \nsian mining town of Gafsa to spark an uprising against \nthe government. Tunisian leaders had been trying for \nseveral years to improve the defensive capabilities of their \ncountry’s 28,000-man military force, and in 1980—1981 \nthey turned to the United States for help. The Reagan \nadministration responded with about $100 million in \nmilitary aid annually from 1982 to 1984; these funds went \ntoward the purchase of American-made M-60 tanks, a \nsquadron of F-5 jet fighters, ground-to-air missiles, a \nradar system, coastal patrol boats, helicopters and ar\xad\nmored personnel carriers. The American response was \nintended to boost the Tunisian military in the face of the \nLibyan threat. There were grounds for criticizing the \nnature of the arms acquired, which were poorly suited to \ndeal with internal subversion, but the choice of weapon \nsystems came from Tunis, not Washington.\nWashington responded once again to Tunisia’s appeal \nfor help after nine days of violent bread riots swept the \ncountry at the end of 1983 and during the first week of\n", 'Articles Concluded •  233\n1984. The Reagan administration dispatched General \nWalters to Tunis; Walters took with him a pledge of an \nadditional $5 million in Public Law 480 food assistance. \nCongress increased Economic Support Funds for the \ncountry from $1.5 million in fiscal year 1984 to $20 \nmillion in fiscal year 1985. At the same time, the United \nStates Agency for International Development (AID) \nmade a decision in mid-1984 to continue economic assis\xad\ntance to Tunisia. This reversed a decision in 1981 to \nphase out the AID program in Tunisia over five years on \nthe grounds that the country had reached a level of \neconomic development— $1,400 annual per capita in\xad\ncome— that no longer justified American aid.\nMilitary aid, meanwhile, was reduced to about $67 \nmilfion for fiscal year 1985 and probably will be reduced \nfurther in the coming years. Although the current mili\xad\ntary aid figure was reduced considerably from the $111- \nmillion level of the previous year, more of this year’s \nassistance is either grant aid or aid at concessional rates. \nThe total economic and military aid for Tunisia declined \nfrom $125 million in fiscal year 1984 to $91.7 million in \nfiscal year 1985.\nSeveral key members of Congress believe that Tunisia, \na moderate Arab nation threatened by Libya, deserves \nfirm American support. President Bourguiba’s health \nproblems in the fall of 1984 underlined the possibility—  \nsome would say probability— of a succession crisis in the \n1980’s. A prolonged crisis would tempt Libya to inter\xad\nvene. United States policymakers would like to contrib\xad\nute to an orderly succession that will preserve Tunisia’s \nindependence and its moderate orientation.\nLIBYA\nUnited States relations with Libya have been un\xad\nfriendly for at least five years and, short of a change of \ngovernment in Tripoli, are unlikely to improve dramati\xad\ncally. The source of friction has little to do with what \nhappens inside Libya, where American business person\xad\nnel and their families are treated very well. The problems \nstem, in Washington’s eyes, from the destructive and \ndestabilizing nature of Qaddafi’s actions on the interna\xad\ntional scene.\nThroughout the 1970’s, successive American adminis\xad\ntrations declined to improve relations with Libya for two \nreasons: the Qaddafi regime’s support of international \nterrorist activities and its opposition to a negotiated solu\xad\ntion of the Arab-Israeli conflict President Richard Nix\xad\non’s administration reduced American diplomatic repre\xad\nsentation in Tripoli to the level of charge following the \ndeparture of the United States ambassador in late 1972. \nFor the next several years, Washington refused to ap\xad\nprove delivery of eight C-130 military transport planes \nthat Tripoli had purchased from Lockheed for $48 mil\xad\nlion. In December, 1979, the Libyan government stood \nby when the American embassy in Tripoli was attacked \nand badly damaged. Following this attack, the Garter \nadministration withdrew all American diplomatic per\xad\nsonnel, closed the embassy, and reduced diplomatic rela\xad\ntions to the lowest level. In  May, 1981, the Reagan \nadministration ordered the Libyan diplomatic mission in \nWashington to leave the country because of its involve\xad\nment in acts of violence. For the last several years, Bel\xad\ngium has represented American interests in Tripoli, while \nthe United Arab Emirates (UAE) has represented Lib\xad\nyan interests in Washington.\nThe Reagan administration has raised American \nopposition to Libya to the level of active confrontation. \nSecretary of State Alexander Haig singled out Libya for \nits interventionist activities, and Vice President Bush \ncalled Qaddafi “the world’s principal terrorist and train\xad\ner of terrorists.” In August, 1981, the United States \ndirectly challenged Libya’s claim that the entire Gulf of \nSidra is Libyan territorial waters by holding well- \npublicized naval maneuvers within the gulf. A clash en\xad\nsued when two American F-14’s from the U.S.S. Nimitz \nshot down two Soviet-made SU-22’s piloted by Libyans \nafter the Libyans opened fire. Tensions between the two \ncountries increased further in the fall of 1981, when the \nWhite House revealed reports that a Libyan hit squad \nplanned to enter the country to assassinate President \nReagan. In  December, the President asked all Americans \nto leave Libya as soon as possible, and the government \nsoon announced that American passports would no long\xad\ner be valid for travel to Libya. Not all Americans living \nand working in Libya heeded this call: but in the two \nyears that followed their number fell from about 2,000 to \nan estimated 600.\nBefore 1982, poor American—Libyan relations had not \ninterfered with the flourishing trade between the two \ncountries. In March, 1982, however, the Reagan admin\xad\nistration imposed a boycott on the importation of petrole\xad\num products from Libya and established a license re\xad\nquirement for most American exports to that country. \nThe boycott reduced the total value of Libyan products \nexported to the United States dramatically, from a high of \n$8.6 billion in 1980 to only $824,000 in 1983. Licensing \ncaused American exports to Libya to fall from a high of \n$813 million in 1981 to $200 milfion in 1984. Still, there is \ncontinuing American business involvement in two major \nconstruction projects in Libya, the “Great Manmade \nRiver”— a 1,300-mile pipeline to bring subterranean wa\xad\nter from the Sahara to the coastal area of Libya for \nirrigation and urban use— and an oil refinery at Ras \nLanuf. In  March, 1984, however, President Reagan \nannounced that there would be no more American ex\xad\nports for the Ras Lanuf project.\nThe ongoing opposition of the Reagan administration \nto the Libyan government derives from four main factors. \nOne is Qaddafi’s support of international terrorism, in\xad\ncluding the Irish Republican Army, Corsican and \nBasque separatists, and the infamous Venezuelan terror\xad\nist “Carlos.” Tripoli has established a series of camps \nwhere training in terrorist tactics is given to foreign revo\xad\nlutionaries, and Libyan hit squads have assassinated a\n', '234 • CURRENT HISTORY, MAY, 1985\nnumber of exiled opponents of the regime in several \nforeign countries. In  late 1981, the Qaddafi regime \nattempted to plant explosives in the American Embassy \nClub in Khartoum. And in November, 1984, the Egyp\xad\ntian security service foiled and pubbcly unmasked an \nassassination attempt by Qaddafi’s agents against former \nLibyan Prime Minister Abdel Hamid Bakoush.\nA second factor is Libya’s implacable hostihty to Israel \nand to a negotiated settlement of the Arab—Israeb con\xad\nflict. In 1978, Qaddafi pushed for the creation of the \nradical Arab Steadfastness Front, which rejected Egypt’s \nseparate peace with Israel. In  1983, Libya actively joined \nSyria to promote a rebel faction within the Palestine \nLiberation Organization (PLO) that challenged the \nmoderate leadership of PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat.\nThird, Libya has attempted repeatedly to undermine \nthe stability of moderate African states. In  February, \n1983, Qaddafi tried to organize a coup to overthrow the \ngovernment of the Sudan. The prompt deployment of \nAmerican AWACS (airborne warning and control sys\xad\ntem) aircraft and Egyptian F-5’s blocked the coup. Libya \nhas also blatantly intervened in Chad, Niger, Tunisia and \nSomalia, either with direct military force or by supplying \narms and money to insurgent groups. On the other hand, \nLibya has provided generous assistance to Ethiopia, Be\xad\nnin and Ghana because they are close to countries Libya \nwants to destabilize: Ivory Coast, Togo, Burkina Faso \n(formerly Upper Volta), Niger and Nigeria.\nFinally, the Sandinista victory in Nicaragua and the \nguerrilla war in El Salvador have encouraged an activist \nLibyan involvement in America’s own backyard. Qadda\xad\nfi made clear his objective of undermining the American \nposition in Central America in a speech in September, \n1983, on the fourteenth anniversary of the Libyan Rev\xad\nolution:\nWhen we ally ourselves with revolution in Latin America, \nand particularly Central America, we are defending our\xad\nselves. This satan [the United States] must be clipped and \nwe must take war to the American borders just as America is \ntaking threats to the Gulf of Sidra.2\nSince 1981, Libya has provided large amounts of arms, \nmoney, and training to Nicaragua and the Farabundo \nM arti movement in El Salvador, and important econom\xad\nic aid to Cuba. The Reagan administration has been \nespecially annoyed with Libya’s growing supply of arms \nto Nicaragua. Smaller amounts of Libyan assistance have \ngone to a variety of leftists groups elsewhere in Latin \nAmerica.3\nStill, Libya remains interested in improving relations \nwith the United States. Because of improved bilateral\n2Quoted in Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), \nD a ily  R eport: M id d le  E a s t  a n d  A fr ica ,  September 2, 1983.\n3See United States, Department of State, Bureau of Public \nAffairs, The L ib ya n  Problem , Special Report No. I l l  (Washing\xad\nton, D.C., October, 1983).\n4In fiscal year 1985, Washington has approved, under PL \n480, Tide II, 290,000 metric tons offbod for Ethiopia, valued at \n$153 million (including shipping).\neconomic ties with the nations of Italy and Greece and the \nunion with Morocco, Libya feels less isolated and more \nconfident than it did a year or two ago. Since the Reagan \nadministration’s conditions for better relations are unlike\xad\nly to be met, poor American—Libyan relations will con\xad\ntinue, along with American efforts to rally European and \nAfrican states to oppose and isolate the Qaddafi regime. \nA more effective way of dealing with Qaddafi, however, \nmay be simply to ignore him while protecting his \nthreatened victims.\nCHAD\nThe Reagan administration has taken more notice of \npoor, landlocked Chad because direct Libyan interven\xad\ntion in Chad’s long civil war has threatened neighboring \nareas of strategic interest to the United States, namely, \nEgypt and the Sudan. In  1983, President Reagan referred \nto Chad as an area in which the French, for historical \nreasons, have the primary responsibility. Some friction in \nAmerican—French relations developed in the fall of 1984 \nwhen Washington’s information on Libyan troops re\xad\nmaining in Chad in violation of a French—Libyan mutual \ntroop withdrawal agreement turned out to be correct. \nThis incident embarrassed the government of French \nPresident Frangois Mitterrand and led to the replace\xad\nment of his foreign minister, Claude Cheysson. The \nReagan administration has strongly backed the govern\xad\nment of President Hissen Habre in its ongoing conflict \nwith the Libyan-supported forces of Goukouni Oueddei.\nIn  response to Chad’s severe drought, in fiscal year \n1985, the United States is providing Chad with more than \n50,000 metric tons of food, valued at about $30 million, \nthrough Public Law (PL) 480, Title II; this is nearly four \ntimes the 14,000 metric tons provided the previous year \nand is comparable, proportionately, to the massive food \nassistance the United States is providing to drought- \nstricken Ethiopia.4 In  addition, Washington is providing \nChad with modest amounts of military and development \nassistance and Economic Support Funds, totaling about \n$19 million for fiscal 1985.\nCONCLUSION\nStrategic and political interests are most important to \nWashington in its relations with the Arab states of North \nAfrica because the Reagan administration gives a very \nhigh priority to the global-strategic competition between \nthe United States and the Soviet Union. Thus Washing\xad\nton will continue a policy of close cooperation with \nMorocco and Tunisia because their governments support \nWestern interests. The administration is likely to improve \nrelations with Algeria to the degree that the Algerians \ndistance themselves from the Soviet Union and play a \npositive and constructive role in the international arena. \nAt the same time, Washington will continue to oppose \nLibya, because of the Qaddafi regime’s strident anti- \nWestern orientation and its penchant for foreign and \ndestabilizing interventions. ■\n']</pre>
