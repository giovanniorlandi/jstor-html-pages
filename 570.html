However, emerging\nscientific research has revealed a surprisingly positive and overlooked environmental factor on health: direct physical contact\nwith the vast supply of electrons on the surface of the Earth. Modern lifestyle separates humans from such contact. The research\nsuggests that this disconnect may be a major contributor to physiological dysfunction and unwellness. Reconnection with the\nEarth’s electrons has been found to promote intriguing physiological changes and subjective reports of well-being. Earthing (or\ngrounding) refers to the discovery of benefits—including better sleep and reduced pain—from walking barefoot outside or sitting,\nworking, or sleeping indoors connected to conductive systems that transfer the Earth’s electrons from the ground into the body.\nThis paper reviews the earthing research and the potential of earthing as a simple and easily accessed global modality of significant\nclinical importance.\n1. Introduction\nEnvironmental medicine focuses on interactions between\nhuman health and the environment, including factors such\nas compromised air and water and toxic chemicals, and\nhow they cause or mediate disease. Omnipresent throughout\nthe environment is a surprisingly beneficial, yet overlooked\nglobal resource for health maintenance, disease prevention,\nand clinical therapy: the surface of the Earth itself. It is\nan established, though not widely appreciated fact, that\nthe Earth’s surface possesses a limitless and continuously\nrenewed supply of free or mobile electrons. The surface\nof the planet is electrically conductive (except in limited\nultradry areas such as deserts), and its negative potential\nis maintained (i.e., its electron supply replenished) by the\nglobal atmospheric electrical circuit [1, 2].\nMounting evidence suggests that the Earth’s negative\npotential can create a stable internal bioelectrical environment\nfor the normal functioning of all body systems.\nMoreover, oscillations of the intensity of the Earth’s potential\nmay be important for setting the biological clocks regulating\ndiurnal body rhythms, such as cortisol secretion [3].\nIt is also well established that electrons from antioxidant\nmolecules neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS, or in popular\nterms, free radicals) involved in the body’s immune and\ninflammatory responses. The National Library of Medicine’s\nonline resource PubMed lists 7021 studies and 522 review\narticles from a search of “antioxidant + electron + free radical”\n[3]. It is assumed that the influx of free electrons\nabsorbed into the body through direct contact with the\nEarth likely neutralize ROS and thereby reduce acute and\n', '2 Journal of Environmental and Public Health\nchronic inflammation [4]. Throughout history, humans\nmostly walked barefoot or with footwear made of animal\nskins. They slept on the ground or on skins. Through direct\ncontact or through perspiration-moistened animal skins\nused as footwear or sleeping mats, the ground’s abundant\nfree electrons were able to enter the body, which is electrically\nconductive [5]. Through this mechanism, every part of the\nbody could equilibrate with the electrical potential of the\nEarth, thereby stabilizing the electrical environment of all\norgans, tissues, and cells.\nModern lifestyle has increasingly separated humans from\nthe primordial flow of Earth’s electrons. For example, since\nthe 1960s, we have increasingly worn insulating rubber\nor plastic soled shoes, instead of the traditional leather\nfashioned from hides. Rossi has lamented that the use of\ninsulating materials in post-World War II shoes has separated\nus from the Earth’s energy field [6]. Obviously, we no longer\nsleep on the ground as we did in times past.\nDuring recent decades, chronic illness, immune disorders,\nand inflammatory diseases have increased dramatically,\nand some researchers have cited environmental factors as the\ncause [7]. However, the possibility of modern disconnection\nwith the Earth’s surface as a cause has not been considered.\nMuch of the research reviewed in this paper points in that\ndirection.\nIn the late 19th century, a back-to-nature movement\nin Germany claimed many health benefits from being\nbarefoot outdoors, even in cold weather [8]. In the 1920s,\nWhite, a medical doctor, investigated the practice of sleeping\ngrounded after being informed by some individuals that they\ncould not sleep properly “unless they were on the ground or\nconnected to the ground in some way,” such as with copper\nwires attached to grounded-to-Earth water, gas, or radiator\npipes. He reported improved sleeping using these techniques\n[9]. However, these ideas never caught on in mainstream\nsociety.\nAt the end of the last century, experiments initiated\nindependently by Ober in the USA [10] and K. Sokal\nand P. Sokal [11] in Poland revealed distinct physiological\nand health benefits with the use of conductive bed pads,\nmats, EKG- and TENS-type electrode patches, and plates\nconnected indoors to the Earth outside. Ober, a retired\ncable television executive, found a similarity between the\nhuman body (a bioelectrical, signal-transmitting organism)\nand the cable used to transmit cable television signals. When\ncables are “grounded” to the Earth, interference is virtually\neliminated from the signal. Furthermore, all electrical\nsystems are stabilized by grounding them to the Earth. K.\nSokal and P. Sokal, meanwhile, discovered that grounding\nthe human body represents a “universal regulating factor in\nNature” that strongly influences bioelectrical, bioenergetic,\nand biochemical processes and appears to offer a significant\nmodulating effect on chronic illnesses encountered daily in\ntheir clinical practices.\nEarthing (also known as grounding) refers to contact\nwith the Earth’s surface electrons by walking barefoot\noutside or sitting, working, or sleeping indoors connected to\nconductive systems, some of them patented, that transfer the\nenergy from the ground into the body. Emerging scientific\nresearch supports the concept that the Earth’s electrons\ninduce multiple physiological changes of clinical significance,\nincluding reduced pain, better sleep, a shift from sympathetic\nto parasympathetic tone in the autonomic nervous system\n(ANS), and a blood-thinning effect. The research, along with\nmany anecdotal reports, is presented in a new book entitled\nEarthing [12].\n2. Review of Earthing Papers\nThe studies summarized below involve indoor-testing methods\nunder controlled conditions that simulate being barefoot\noutdoors.\n2.1. Sleep and Chronic Pain. In a blinded pilot study, Ober\nrecruited 60 subjects (22 males and 28 females) who suffered\nfrom self-described sleep disturbances and chronic muscle\nand joint pain for at least six months [10]. Subjects were\nrandomly divided for the month-long study in which both\ngroups slept on conductive carbon fiber mattress pads\nprovided by Ober. Half the pads were connected to a\ndedicated Earth ground outside each subject’s bedroom\nwindow, while the other half were “sham” grounded—not\nconnected to the Earth. Results are presented in Table 1.\nMost grounded subjects described symptomatic improvement\nwhile most in the control group did not. Some\nsubjects reported significant relief from asthmatic and respiratory\nconditions, rheumatoid arthritis, PMS, sleep apnea,\nand hypertension while sleeping grounded. These results\nindicated that the effects of earthing go beyond reduction of\npain and improvements in sleep.\n2.2. Sleep, Stress, Pain, and Cortisol. A pilot study evaluated\ndiurnal rhythms in cortisol correlated with changes in sleep,\npain, and stress (anxiety, depression, and irritability), as\nmonitored by subjective reporting [13]. Twelve subjects\nwith complaints of sleep dysfunction, pain, and stress were\ngrounded to Earth during sleep in their own beds using a\nconductive mattress pad for 8 weeks.\nIn order to obtain a baseline measurement of cortisol,\nsubjects chewed Dacron salvettes for 2 minutes and then\nplaced them in time-labeled sampling tubes that were\nstored in a refrigerator. Self-administered sample collections\nbegan at 8 AM and were repeated every 4 hours. After 6\nweeks of being grounded, subjects repeated this 24-hour\nsaliva test. The samples were processed using a standard\nradioimmunoassay. A composite of the results is shown in\nFigure 1.\nSubjective symptoms of sleep dysfunction, pain, and\nstress were reported daily throughout the 8-week test period.\nThe majority of subjects with high- to out-of-range nighttime\nsecretion levels experienced improvements by sleeping\ngrounded. This is demonstrated by the restoration of normal\nday-night cortisol secretion profiles.\nEleven of 12 participants reported falling asleep more\nquickly, and all 12 reported waking up fewer times at night.\nGrounding the body at night during sleep also appears to\n', 'Journal of Environmental and Public Health 3\nTable 1: Subjective sleep, pain, and well-being feedback.\nCategories\nTest subjects∗ Control subjects∗∗\nSame Improved Same Improved\nTime to fall asleep 4= 15% 23= 85% 20= 87% 3= 13%\nQuality of sleep 2= 7% 25= 93% 20= 87% 3= 13%\nWake feeling rested 0= 0% 27= 100% 20= 87% 3= 13%\nMuscles stiffness and pain 5= 18% 22= 82% 23= 100% 0= 0%\nChronic back and/or joint pain 7= 26% 20= 74% 23= 100% 0= 0%\nGeneral well-being 6= 22% 21= 78% 20= 87% 3= 13%\n∗\nReports not received from three participants.\n∗∗Reports not received from seven participants.\n24-hour cortisol secretion profile before grounding\n0\n(a) (b)\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nMid Noon\n24-hour cortisol secretion profile after grounding\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nMid 8 Noon8 pm8 pm 4 pm am 4 pm8 am4 am 4 am\nFigure 1: Cortisol levels before and after grounding. In unstressed individuals, the normal 24-hour cortisol secretion profile follows a\npredictable pattern: lowest around midnight and highest around 8 a.m. Graph (a) illustrates the wide variation of patterns among study\nparticipants prior to grounding, while (b) shows a realignment and normalization trend of patterns after six weeks of sleeping grounded.\npositively affect morning fatigue levels, daytime energy, and\nnighttime pain levels.\nAbout 30 percent of the general American adult population\ncomplain of sleep disruption, while approximately\n10 percent have associated symptoms of daytime functional\nimpairment consistent with the diagnosis of insomnia.\nInsomnia often correlates with major depression, generalized\nanxiety, substance abuse, dementia, and a variety of pain and\nphysical problems. The direct and indirect costs of chronic\ninsomnia have been estimated at tens of billions of dollars\nannually in the USA alone [14]. In view of the burdens of\npersonal discomfort and health care costs, grounding the\nbody during sleep seems to have much to offer.\n2.3. Earthing Reduces Electric Fields Induced on the Body.\nVoltage induced on a human body from the electrical\nenvironment was measured using a high-impedance measurement\nhead. Applewhite, an electrical engineer and expert\nin the design of electrostatic discharge systems in the\nelectronic industry, was both subject and author of the study\n[15]. Measurements were taken while ungrounded and then\ngrounded using a conductive patch and conductive bed pad.\nThe author measured the induced fields at three positions:\nleft breast, abdomen, and left thigh.\nEach method (patch and sheet) immediately reduced the\ncommon alternating current (AC) 60 Hz ambient voltage\n0\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\nV\nol\nts\n, R\nM\nS\nBaseline 1.24 1.3 1.32\nBed pad 0.01 0.012 0.009\nLeft breast Abdomen Left thigh\nFigure 2: Effect of bed pad grounding on 60 Hz mode.\ninduced on the body by a highly significant factor of about\n70 on average. Figure 2 shows this effect.\nThe study showed that when the body is grounded,\nits electrical potential becomes equalized with the Earth’s\nelectrical potential through a transfer of electrons from the\nEarth to the body. This, in turn, prevents the 60 Hz mode\nfrom producing an AC electric potential at the surface of\nthe body and from producing perturbations of the electric\ncharges of the molecules inside the body. The study confirms\nthe “umbrella” effect of earthing the body explained by\nNobel Prize winner Richard Feynman in his lectures on\nelectromagnetism [16]. Feynman said that when the body\npotential is the same as the Earth’s electric potential (and\n', '4 Journal of Environmental and Public Health\nthus grounded), it becomes an extension of the Earth’s\ngigantic electric system. The Earth’s potential thus becomes\nthe “working agent that cancels, reduces, or pushes away\nelectric fields from the body.”\nApplewhite was able to document changes in the ambient\nvoltage induced on the body by monitoring the voltage drop\nacross a resistor. This effect clearly showed the “umbrella\neffect” described above. The body of the grounded person\nis not subject to the perturbation of electrons and electrical\nsystems.\nJamieson asks whether the failure to appropriately\nground humans is a factor contributing to the potential\nconsequences of electropollution in office settings [17].\nConsiderable debate exists on whether electromagnetic fields\nin our environment cause a risk to health [18], but there\nis no question that the body reacts to the presence of\nenvironmental electric fields. This study demonstrates that\ngrounding essentially eliminates the ambient voltage induced\non the body from common electricity power sources.\n2.4. Physiological and Electrophysiological Effects\n2.4.1. Reductions in Overall Stress Levels and Tension and Shift\nin ANS Balance. Fifty-eight healthy adult subjects (including\n30 controls) participated in a randomized double-blind pilot\nstudy investigating earthing effects on human physiology\n[19]. Earthing was accomplished with a conductive adhesive\npatch placed on the sole of each foot. A biofeedback system\nrecorded electrophysiological and physiological parameters.\nExperimental subjects were exposed to 28 minutes in the\nunearthed condition followed by 28 minutes with the\nearthing wire connected. Controls were unearthed for 56\nminutes.\nUpon earthing, about half the subjects showed an\nabrupt, almost instantaneous change in root mean square\n(rms) values of electroencephalograms (EEGs) from the left\nhemisphere (but not the right hemisphere) at all frequencies\nanalyzed by the biofeedback system (beta, alpha, theta, and\ndelta).\nAll grounded subjects presented an abrupt change in\nrms values of surface electromyograms (SEMGs) from right\nand left upper trapezius muscles. Earthing decreased blood\nvolume pulse (BVP) in 19 of 22 experimental subjects\n(statistically significant) and in 8 of 30 controls (not\nsignificant). Earthing the human body showed significant\neffects on electrophysiological properties of the brain and\nmusculature, on the BVP, and on the noise and stability of\nelectrophysiological recordings. Taken together, the changes\nin EEG, EMG, and BVP suggest reductions in overall\nstress levels and tensions and a shift in ANS balance upon\nearthing. The results extend the conclusions of previous\nstudies.\n2.4.2. Confirming Shift from Sympathetic to Parasympathetic\nActivation. A multiparameter double-blind study was\ndesigned to reproduce and expand on previous electrophysiological\nand physiological parameters measured immediately\nafter grounding with an improved methodology and stateof-the-art\nequipment [20]. Fourteen men and 14 women,\nin good health, ages 18–80, were tested while seated in\na comfortable recliner during 2-hour grounding sessions,\nleaving time for signals to stabilize before, during, and\nafter grounding (40 minutes for each period). Sham 2hour\ngrounding sessions were also recorded with the same\nsubjects as controls. For each session, statistical analyses were\nperformed on four 10-minute segments: before and after\ngrounding (sham grounding for control sessions) and before\nand after ungrounding (sham ungrounding for control\nsessions). The following results were documented:\n(i) an immediate decrease (within a few seconds) in skin\nconductance (SC) at grounding and an immediate\nincrease at ungrounding. No change was seen for the\ncontrol (sham grounding) sessions;\n(ii) respiratory rate (RR) increased during grounding,\nan effect that lasted after ungrounding. RR variance\nincreased immediately after grounding and then\ndecreased;\n(iii) blood oxygenation (BO) variance decreased during\ngrounding, followed by a dramatic increase after\nungrounding;\n(iv) pulse rate (PR) and perfusion index (PI) variances\nincreased toward the end of the grounding period,\nand this change persisted after ungrounding.\nThe immediate decrease in SC indicates a rapid activation\nof the parasympathetic nervous system and corresponding\ndeactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. The immediate\nincrease in SC at cessation of grounding indicates an\nopposite effect. Increased RR, stabilization of BO, and slight\nrise in heart rate suggest the start of a metabolic healing\nresponse necessitating an increase in oxygen consumption.\n2.4.3. Immune Cell and Pain Responses with Delayed-Onset\nMuscle Soreness Induction. Pain reduction from sleeping\ngrounded has been documented in previous studies [10,\n13]. This pilot study looked for blood markers that might\ndifferentiate between grounded and ungrounded subjects\nwho completed a single session of intense, eccentric exercise\nresulting in delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) of the\ngastrocnemius [21]. If markers were able to differentiate\nthese groups, future studies could be done in greater detail\nwith a larger subject base. DOMS is a common complaint\nin the fitness and athletic world following excessive physical\nactivity and involves acute inflammation in overtaxed muscles.\nIt develops in 14 to 48 hours and persists for more than\n96 hours [22]. No known treatment reduces the recovery\nperiod, but apparently massage and hydrotherapy [23–25]\nand acupuncture [26] can reduce pain.\nEight healthy men ages 20–23 were put through a similar\nroutine of toe raises while carrying on their shoulders\na barbell equal to one-third of their body weight. Each\nparticipant was exercised individually on a Monday morning\nand then monitored for the rest of the week while following\na similar eating, sleeping, and living schedule in a hotel. The\n', 'Journal of Environmental and Public Health 5\ngroup was randomly divided in half and either grounded\nor sham grounded with the use of a conductive patch\nplaced at the sole of each foot during active hours and a\nconductive sheet at night. Complete blood counts, blood\nchemistry, enzyme chemistry, serum and saliva cortisol,\nmagnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, and pain\nlevels (a total of 48 parameters) were taken at the same\ntime of day before the eccentric exercise and at 24, 48, and\n72 hours afterwards. Parameters consistently differing by 10\npercent or more, normalized to baseline, were considered\nworthy of further study.\nParameters that differed by these criteria included white\nblood cell counts, bilirubin, creatine kinase, phosphocreatine/inorganic\nphosphate ratios, glycerolphosphorylcholine,\nphosphorylcholine, the visual analogue pain scale, and\npressure measurements on the right gastrocnemius.\nThe results showed that grounding the body to the Earth\nalters measures of immune system activity and pain. Among\nthe ungrounded men, for instance, there was an expected,\nsharp increase in white blood cells at the stage when DOMS\nis known to reach its peak and greater perception of pain (see\nFigure 3). This effect demonstrates a typical inflammatory\nresponse. In comparison, the grounded men had only a slight\ndecrease in white blood cells, indicating scant inflammation,\nand, for the first time ever observed, a shorter recovery\ntime. Brown later commented that there were “significant\ndifferences” in the pain these men reported [12].\n2.4.4. Heart Rate Variability. The rapid change in skin conductance\nreported in an earlier study led to the hypothesis\nthat grounding may also improve heart rate variability\n(HRV), a measurement of the heart’s response to ANS\nregulation. A double-blind study was designed with 27 participants\n[27]. Subjects sat in a comfortable reclining chair.\nFour transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)\ntype adhesive electrode patches were placed on the sole of\neach foot and on each palm.\nParticipants served as their own controls. Each participant’s\ndata from a 2-hour session (40 minutes of which\nwas grounded) were compared with another 2-hour shamgrounded\nsession. The sequence of grounding versus sham-\ngrounding sessions was assigned randomly.\nDuring the grounded sessions, participants had statistically\nsignificant improvements in HRV that went way\nbeyond basic relaxation results (which were shown by the\nnongrounded sessions). Since improved HRV is a significant\npositive indicator on cardiovascular status, it is suggested\nthat simple grounding techniques be utilized as a basic\nintegrative strategy in supporting the cardiovascular system,\nespecially under situations of heightened autonomic tone\nwhen the sympathetic nervous system is more activated than\nthe parasympathetic nervous system.\n2.4.5. Reduction of Primary Indicators of Osteoporosis,\nImprovement of Glucose Regulation, and Immune Response.\nK. Sokal and P. Sokal, cardiologist and neurosurgeon father\nand son on the medical staff of a military clinic in\nPoland, conducted a series of experiments to determine\nwhether contact with the Earth via a copper conductor can\naffect physiological processes [11]. Their investigations were\nprompted by the question as to whether the natural electric\ncharge on the surface of the Earth influences the regulation\nof human physiological processes.\nDouble-blind experiments were conducted on groups\nranging from 12 to 84 subjects who followed similar\nphysical activity, diet, and fluid intake during the trial\nperiods. Grounding was achieved with a copper plate\n(30 mm× 80 mm) placed on the lower part of the leg,\nattached with a strip so that it would not come off during\nthe night. The plate was connected by a conductive wire to\na larger plate (60 mm× 250 mm) placed in contact with the\nEarth outside.\nIn one experiment with nonmedicated subjects, grounding\nduring a single night of sleep resulted in statistically\nsignificant changes in concentrations of minerals and electrolytes\nin the blood serum: iron, ionized calcium, inorganic\nphosphorus, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Renal\nexcretion of both calcium and phosphorus was reduced\nsignificantly. The observed reductions in blood and urinary\ncalcium and phosphorus directly relate to osteoporosis. The\nresults suggest that Earthing for a single night reduces\nprimary indicators of osteoporosis.\nEarthing continually during rest and physical activity\nover a 72-hour period decreased fasting glucose among\npatients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\nPatients had been well controlled with glibenclamide, an\nantidiabetic drug, for about 6 months, but at the time of\nstudy had unsatisfactory glycemic control despite dietary and\nexercise advice and glibenclamide doses of 10 mg/day.\nK. Sokal and P. Sokal drew blood samples from 6 male\nand 6 female adults with no history of thyroid disease. A\nsingle night of grounding produced a significant decrease\nof free tri-iodothyronine and an increase of free thyroxin\nand thyroid-stimulating hormone. The meaning of these\nresults is unclear but suggests an earthing influence on\nhepatic, hypothalamus, and pituitary relationships with\nthyroid function. Ober et al. [12] have observed that\nmany individuals on thyroid medication reported symptoms\nof hyperthyroid, such as heart palpitations, after starting\ngrounding. Such symptoms typically vanish after medication\nis adjusted downward under medical supervision. Through\na series of feedback regulations, thyroid hormones affect\nalmost every physiological process in the body, including\ngrowth and development, metabolism, body temperature,\nand heart rate. Clearly, further study of earthing effects on\nthyroid function is needed.\nIn another experiment, the effect of grounding on\nthe classic immune response following vaccination was\nexamined. Earthing accelerated the immune response, as\ndemonstrated by increases in gamma globulin concentration.\nThis result confirms an association between earthing\nand the immune response, as was suggested in the DOMS\nstudy [21].\nK. Sokal and P. Sokal conclude that earthing the human\nbody influences human physiological processes, including\nincreasing the activity of catabolic processes and may be “the\nprimary factor regulating endocrine and nervous systems.”\n', '6 Journal of Environmental and Public Health\nWhite blood cells\n−10\n−5\n0\n10\n20\n15\n5\n(days) (days)\nC\nh\nan\nge\n (\n%\n)\nC\nh\nan\nge\n (\n%\n)\nPlacebo\nGrounded\nPlacebo\n0\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4\n0\nGrounded\nPlacebo\nGrounded\n−0.45 −1.35 −4.05\nPain scale\n0\n40\n80\n120\n160\n200\nPlacebo\nGrounded\n0\n0\n13.8715.979.66 127.59172.41113.79\n41.389.1328.26\nFigure 3: Delayed onset muscle soreness and grounding. Consistent with all measurements, ungrounded subjects expressed the perception\nof greater pain. Related to the pain finding was evidence of a muted white blood cell response indicating that a grounded body experiences\nless inflammation.\n2.4.6. Altered Blood Electrodynamics. Since grounding produces\nchanges in many electrical properties of the body\n[1, 15, 19, 28], a next logical step was to evaluate the\nelectrical property of the blood. A suitable measure is the zeta\npotential of red blood cells (RBCs) and RBC aggregation.\nZeta potential is a parameter closely related to the number\nof negative charges on the surface of an RBC. The higher\nthe number, the greater the ability of the RBC to repel other\nRBCs. Thus, the greater the zeta potential the less coagulable\nis the blood.\nTen relatively healthy subjects participated in the study\n[29]. They were seated comfortably in a reclining chair and\nwere grounded for two hours with electrode patches placed\non their feet and hands, as in previous studies. Blood samples\nwere taken before and after.\nGrounding the body to the earth substantially increases\nthe zeta potential and decreases RBC aggregation, thereby\nreducing blood viscosity. Subjects in pain reported reduction\nto the point that it was almost unnoticeable. The results\nstrongly suggest that earthing is a natural solution for\npatients with excessive blood viscosity, an option of great\ninterest not just for cardiologists, but also for any physician\nconcerned about the relationship of blood viscosity, clotting,\nand inflammation. In 2008, Adak and colleagues reported the\npresence of both hypercoagulable blood and poor RBC zeta\npotential among diabetics. Zeta potential was particularly\npoor among diabetics with cardiovascular disease [30].\n3. Discussion\nUntil now, the physiological significance and possible health\neffects of stabilizing the internal bioelectrical environment of\nan organism have not been a significant topic of research.\nSome aspects of this, however, are relatively obvious. In the\nabsence of Earth contact, internal charge distribution will\nnot be uniform, but instead will be subject to a variety of\nelectrical perturbations in the environment. It is well known\nthat many important regulations and physiological processes\ninvolve events taking place on cell and tissue surfaces. In the\nabsence of a common reference point, or “ground,” electrical\ngradients, due to uneven charge distribution, can build up\nalong tissue surfaces and cell membranes.\nWe can predict that such charge differentials will influence\nbiochemical and physiological processes. First, the\nstructure and functioning of many enzymes are sensitive to\nlocal environmental conditions. Each enzyme has an optimal\npH that favors maximal activity. A change in the electrical\nenvironment can alter the pH of biological fluids and the\ncharge distribution on molecules and thereby affect reaction\nrates. The pH effect results because of critical charged amino\nacids at the active site of the enzyme that participate in\nsubstrate binding and catalysis. In addition, the ability of a\nsubstrate or enzyme to donate or accept hydrogen ions is\ninfluenced by pH.\nAnother example is provided by voltage-gated ion channels,\nwhich play critical biophysical roles in excitable cells\nsuch as neurons. Local alterations in the charge profiles\naround these channels can lead to electrical instability of the\ncell membrane and to the inappropriate spontaneous activity\nobserved during certain pathological states [31].\nEarthing research offers insights into the clinical potential\nof barefoot contact with the Earth, or simulated barefoot\ncontact indoors via simple conductive systems, on the stability\nof internal bioelectrical function and human physiology.\nInitial experiments resulted in subjective reports of improved\nsleep and reduced pain [10]. Subsequent research showed\nthat improved sleep was correlated with a normalization of\nthe cortisol day-night profile [13]. The results are significant\nin light of the extensive research showing that lack of sleep\nstresses the body and contributes to many detrimental health\nconsequences. Lack of sleep is often the result of pain. Hence,\nreduction of pain might be one reason for the benefits just\ndescribed.\nPain reduction from sleeping grounded has been confirmed\nin a controlled study on DOMS. Earthing is the\nfirst intervention known to speed recovery from DOMS\n[21]. Painful conditions are often the result of various\nkinds of acute or chronic inflammation conditions caused\n', 'Journal of Environmental and Public Health 7\nin part by ROS generated by normal metabolism and also\nby the immune system as part of the response to injury or\ntrauma. Inflammation can cause pain and loss of range of\nmotion in joints. Inflammatory swelling can put pressure\non pain receptors (nocireceptors) and can compromise the\nmicrocirculation, leading to ischemic pain. Inflammation\ncan cause the release of toxic molecules that also activate pain\nreceptors. Modern biomedical research has also documented\na close relationship between chronic inflammation and\nvirtually all chronic diseases, including the diseases of aging,\nand the aging process itself. The steep rise in inflammatory\ndiseases, in fact, has been recently called “inflamm-aging”\nto describe a progressive inflammatory status and a loss\nof stress-coping ability as major components of the aging\nprocess [32].\nReduction in inflammation as a result of earthing has\nbeen documented with infrared medical imaging [28] and\nwith measurements of blood chemistry and white blood\ncell counts [21]. The logical explanation for the antiinflammatory\neffects is that grounding the body allows\nnegatively charged antioxidant electrons from the Earth to\nenter the body and neutralize positively charged free radicals\nat sites of inflammation [28]. Flow of electrons from the\nEarth to the body has been documented [15].\nA pilot study on the electrodynamics of red blood\ncells (zeta potential) has revealed that earthing significantly\nreduces blood viscosity, an important but neglected\nparameter in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes [29], and\ncirculation in general. Thus, thinning the blood may allow\nfor more oxygen delivery to tissues and further support the\nreduction of inflammation.\nStress reduction has been confirmed with various measures\nshowing rapid shifts in the ANS from sympathetic\nto parasympathetic dominance, improvement in heart rate\nvariability, and normalization of muscle tension [19, 20, 27].\nNot reported here are many observations over more\nthan two decades by Ober et al. [12] and K. Sokal\nand P. Sokal [11] indicating that regular earthing may\nimprove blood pressure, cardiovascular arrhythmias, and\nautoimmune conditions such as lupus, multiple sclerosis,\nand rheumatoid arthritis. Some effects of earthing on\nmedication are described by Ober et al. [12] and at the\nwebsite: http://www.earthinginstitute.net/. As an example,\nthe combination of earthing and coumadin has the potential\nto exert a compounded blood thinning effect and must be\nsupervised by a physician. Multiple anecdotes of elevated\nINR have been reported. INR (international normalized\nratio) is a widely used measurement of coagulation. The\ninfluence of earthing on thyroid function and medication has\nbeen described earlier.\nFrom a practical standpoint, clinicians could recommend\noutdoor “barefoot sessions” to patients, weather, and conditions\npermitting. Ober et al. [12] have observed that going\nbarefoot as little as 30 or 40 minutes daily can significantly\nreduce pain and stress, and the studies summarized here\nexplain why this is the case. Obviously, there is no cost for\nbarefoot grounding. However, the use of conductive systems\nwhile sleeping, working, or relaxing indoors offer a more\nconvenient and routine-friendly approach.\n4. Conclusion\nDe Flora et al. wrote the following: “Since the late 20th century,\nchronic degenerative diseases have overcome infectious\ndisease as the major causes of death in the 21st century, so\nan increase in human longevity will depend on finding an\nintervention that inhibits the development of these diseases\nand slows their progress” [33].\nCould such an intervention be located right beneath our\nfeet? Earthing research, observations, and related theories\nraise an intriguing possibility about the Earth’s surface\nelectrons as an untapped health resource—the Earth as\na “global treatment table.” Emerging evidence shows that\ncontact with the Earth—whether being outside barefoot\nor indoors connected to grounded conductive systems—\nmay be a simple, natural, and yet profoundly effective\nenvironmental strategy against chronic stress, ANS dysfunction,\ninflammation, pain, poor sleep, disturbed HRV,\nhypercoagulable blood, and many common health disorders,\nincluding cardiovascular disease. The research done to date\nsupports the concept that grounding or earthing the human\nbody may be an essential element in the health equation\nalong with sunshine, clean air and water, nutritious food, and\nphysical activity.\nDisclosure\nG.
