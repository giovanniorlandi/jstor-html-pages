Bonds are being voted all\nover the state for bridges and roads\nend on every hand the work of the\nhighway department is being advocated.\nMiles and miles or roads have been\nbuilt under the direction of the department\nand every point in the state\ncan be reached by automobile in a\nshort time over the present road system.\nThe progress has been fine, but\nthe work is just getting well under\nway as the department has contracts\namounting to several million dollars\n~ ah?i\nuv/n uciu^ uueu.\nIt may be safely said that one of\nthe major activities Of the state at\nthe present time is road and bridge\nbuilding. This activity, of course, is\na direct result of an insistent public\ndemand for improved automobile\nroads.\nThere are now some 84,000 registered\nmotor vehicles being operated\nover the roads of the state, and it is a\nsurprising fact, according to the rectpr\nords of the highway department, that\nin spite of" the present depressed\nfinancial situation, the number of registrations\nfor 1922 llns shown nn in.\ncrease over the number for the same\nperiod of 1921. This means that the\ndemand for improved roads will certainly\nnot be decreased, and the\namounts of money to be expended for\nsatisfying this demand will probably\nbe greater hereafter than heretofore.\nThere is apparently no question but\nthat people want and are willing to\npay for good roads. The real questions\nthat the taxpayers want enlightenment\nor relate to the progress being\nmade and the value received for the\nmoney expended. In other words, are\nthe people getting good roads and are\nthey getting them economically?\nWith the idea in.mind of answering\nthese questions The State has\nsought interviews with officials of the\nstate highway department and has\nsecured access to. considerable infor.\nmation, from which the following\nprogress review and cost data have\nbeen drawn:\nBeginning of Work.\nThe state highway department was\norganized in 1917 and began to function\nabout the same time that war\nwith Germany Was declared. During\nthe first two years of the department\'s\nexistence, the principal work\naccomplished was of an Investigational\nnature, though surveys and\nplans were made for a number of\nroads and a few construction projects\nwere started. With the close of the\nwar counties all over the state became\nactive in road building and by the end\nof 1919 the road situation revealed a\ndefinite plan for the completion of the\nsystem of state highways that had\nbeen projected by the state highway\ncommission.\nAt the close of 1919 nearly\'100\nmiles of road had been completed under\nthe supervision of the state highway\ndepartment, while surveys had\nbeen completed for more than 600\nmiles and contracts had been let for\nnearly 200 miles. In addition to this\nwork, several counties were going\nahead constructing roads on the state\nhighway system so that on December\nSI 1Q1Q nrrnniri>mprt? Vinri Iwon nor.\nfected for constructing nearly 650\nmiles cf the state highway system,\nincluding the work already completed.\nIn 1920 the legislature reorganised\nt&e highway department and made\nprovision for the department to main\ntain all toads constructed on the state\nsystem out of the proceeds from the\nmotor vehicle license fees. A total\nof 411 miles were found to be constructed\nin accordance with the department\nstandards, and that mileage\nwas placed under state maintenance\nabout the middle of 1920. At that\ntime the only two county seats in the\nstate that were connected by an improved\nstate highway were Greenville\nami Pfolrftnir\nIn leas than two years\' time, since\nstate maintenance was first inaugurated,\nthe roads under maintenance\nhave increased from 411 mites to approximately\n1,500 miles and 22 of\nthe 46 county seats have completed\nconnections with other county seats\nFive additional county seats will be\nafforded such connections with the\n!- completion of construction work nov\nwell under way. Furthermore, travelers\nbetween points as remote from\neach other as Bishopville and Wat\nhalla can make the entire journey b.,\nr auto without leaving an improvee\nstate road, except in some om tin\ni towns, and from Charleston Spartan\nVilirc A HiatanrA nf J>!ln milau nnli\nI about 80 miles of unimproved road ii\nencountered and all except about fou\n_ and one-half miles of this 80 are no\\\n* under construction. Prom Lancaste\nto Augusta, over 140 miles, there ii\nonly one unimproved gap of a Lou\nfour and onct-half miles.\nOf the 1,500 miles of state road:\nDADE\nHIGHWAY BUILDING\ni completed and undei state maintenance,\nthe highway department has\ni participated with federal aid in the\nconstruction of approximately one\nhalf, the mileage of federal aid road\ncompleted being 85 miles of hard\nsurface and 1,415 miles of other types.\nIn addition to the federal aid work,\nthe department, in conjunction with\ncounty officials, has completed a number\nof important connections through\nthe use of residue of the automobile\nlicense fund not required for maintenance.\nWith the advent of the present yeai\nthe cost of building roads and bridges\ndecreased noticeably. The average\ncost per mile for hard surfaced roads\ncompleted in 1921 was $38,078.01 as\ncompared with $29,930.58 for the\nr.rocon f uoor TV>n otf?*?nnr?\n|/?vmvi?V J V.MJL, M.

The six bridges\ncompleted and listed as "major" projects\nare: Broad river bridge at Locki\nhart, 700 feet of concrete and steel at\na cost of $76,407.28; the Edisto river\n\'bridge at Jacksonboro, 628 feet of\nconcrete and steel at a cost of $78,929.43;\nWhale Branch bridge in Beaufort\ncounty, 550 feet of concrete (substructure\nonly) at a cost of $35,291.17;\nHard Labor creek bridge in\nMcCormick county, 206 feet of concrete\nat a cost of $31,794.33.; Fishing\nCreek bridge in Chester county, 291\nfeet of concrete at a cost of $13,934.86;\nand Four Hole Swamp bridge\n| in Dorchester county, 374 feet of con\ncrete at a cost of $21,031.70.\nMajor bridge projects under construction\nby the department are listed\nas follows: Santee Itiver bridge,\nconcrete and steel, estimated to cost\n$847,409.37; Wateree River bridge,\nconcrete and steel, estimated to cost\n$149,618.86; Big Thickety Creek\nbridge, Cherokee county, 625 feet of\nsteel, estimated to cost $32,480.70; Edisto\nRiver bridge between Orangeburg\n-**nd Bamberg -counties, 6!S feet -ad\nconcrete and steel, estimated to cost\n$43,651.06; Sand Bar. Ferry bridge,\n1,483 feet of concrete and steel, estimated\nto cost $222,168.83.\nSeme of the larger projects that are\nbeing considered and on which work\nwill likely begin at an early date are:\nBridge over the Little Pee Dee river\nin Marion county to cost around $30,nnn\n- i??

Lewis, president of the United\nMine Workers of America, announced\nthat the union policy was still unaltered\nand unyielding in its insistence\nthat a new wage scale must be set up\nfor the strike-ridden mining districts\nby national or semi-national conferences\nwith operators.\nThe meeting between Mr. Harding,\nSecretary Davis and Mr. Lewis,\nwhich took place at the White House,\nwas the last of a sedies of conferences\ninto which Secretary Davis took\nMr. Lewis today.\nOfficially no statement was forthcoming,\nthough Secretary Hoover\nalso was called to the White House\nimmediately after Mr. Lewis left.\nMr. Lewis was first invited to\nWashington last Tuesday and upon\n4-~ Gnn\nilia aiiivui ouiiiitiy wua taivcu iu oct- i\nretary Davis\' apartment for a discus- t\nsion running several hours past mid- I\nnight to be renewed later today at the ?\nlabor department. I\n"We talked over the general prob- f\nlems of the bituminous industry and\nthe strike," Mr. Lewis declared on i\nleaving the White House. t\n"With relation to the present strike ?\nwe considered the matter" of a joint (\nconference of operators and miners, t\nespeciully proposals to hold district\njoint conferences between operators f\nand miners for wage settlements as <\ncompared with a joint conference in f\nthe central competitive field, or a na- (\ntional conference of all fields through\nrepresentatives. No definite plans affecting\nthe strike were decided upon.\nThe strike stiuation is unchanged,\nt country," he added, "will be .\nfacing a serious shortage of coal ,\nwithin "a few weeks and if the strike\ncontinues the railroads will be unable i\nto transport enough to take care of j\nindustries and consumers." 1\n. _ There were no indications of what\nfurther steps might be taken by the i\ngovernment after the meetings had\nbeen concluded.\nGreer-Bishop\nMiss Lillian Bishop and Mr. C.

The\nbiggest "favorable trade oalance" that\nwe ever had prior to the war, says the\nTrade Record of The National City\nBank of New York, was $660,000,000\nin the fiscal year 1908, $665,000,000\nin 1901, and $653,000,000 in 1913. In\nthe fiscal year 1914, all of which\nelapsed before the beginning of the\nwar, the excess of exports over imports\nwas $470,653,000, and in the fiscal\nyear which ends with this month\nwill be approximately $1,140,000,000,\nor 140 per cent over that of the year\npreceding the war, and nearly 100 per\ncent above that of any pre-war year.\nThe billion dollar line in the "favorable\ntrade balance" was first crossed\nin the fiscal year 1915, and the exce: s\nof exports over imports rapidly\nmounted during the war to a little\nover $2,000,000,000 in 1916, 3^ billions\nin 1918, and a little over four\nbillion dollars in 1919, dropping to $2,870,000,000\nin 1920 and $2,862,000,000\nin 1921, while for the current yeai\nwill, as above indicated, approximate\n$1,140,000,000, all of these figures\nrelating to the fiscal years.\n"Favorable trade balances," adds\nthe Trad? Record, have been the rule\nin our foreign trade since the development\nof our great Mississippi Valley\nas a producer of the foodstuffs and\nmanufacturing materials which the\nworld requires, and of our factories\nwhich supply tbe big increase in our\nexports of manufactures. In the long\nperiod from 1790 to the beginning of\n1874 imports almost continuously exceeded\nimports. In 70 of the 84 years\nfrom 1790 to 1874, imports exceeded\nexports; in 44 of the 48 years since\n1874, exports exceeded imports. The\nexcess of imports over exports from\n1790 to the beginning of 1874 was, in\nround terms, $2,300,000,000, while the\nexcess of exports over imports from\nthe beginning of 1871 to date exceeds\nf3i,ooo,o(xr,ooo.\nThis change from a practically coniuous\nexcess of imports to a practically\ncontinuous excess of exports,\nwhich dates from 1874, is at least\nsimultaneous with the development o.\nour railroad system which brought the\ngreat producing interior in close touch\nwith the water\'s edge, the railways\nof the country having aggregated in\n1872 but 66,000 miles, as against 226,000\nat the present time.\nThe imports into the United States\nfrom the beginning ?>f 1790 to the en<i\nof the fiscal year 1922 nggregat^ $74,\n066,000,000 and the exports $103,\n734,000,000; the excess of exports foi\nthe entire period aggregates $29,668,\n000,000.\nNotice\nAH persons indebted to the Blm\nCToss Electric Co. will please rnaki\nsettlement with the undersigned.
