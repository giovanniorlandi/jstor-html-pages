BRANDON, RANKIN COUNTY, MISS., MAY 1, 1919\n—1^———■ l lll■■llll■■ll■l■l II II ■■fTflMWI ... - ~ - \' ■ ■ —I—\nHimEaclT\nThe war is won, but the bills must be paid. The success of the Victory Liberty\nLoan is your job. You are lending, riot giving your money, and your Government\nguarantees its return with 4% per cent interest.\nRANKIN WILL NOT FAIL\nRankin county has always been loyal to its government.\nEvery obligation imposed by the government has been\npromptly and cheerfully met.\nAll former loans have been put over without trouble, our\npeople realizing the! great necessity of the government having\nthe ready cash to defray the expenses incidnt to the war.\nVictory now crowns our efforts; but the job is not finish\ned.\nThe Victory Loan is starting off splendidly all over the\nnation.\nThe reason is perfectly plain. When there is something\n\'for sale that eventually everybody will want, the jwise men,\nthe trained in buying, are the first in the market, buying to\ntheir capacity.\nThat explains what great blocks of the bonds are being\nbought by big banks, by millionaires, by men who make a\nstudy of investing money.\n’iou know how when a popular play begins a run in a\ngreat city theatre the brokers buy tickets months in advance.\nThey-know that tomorrow or next week you will Want to see\nj that play and will be willing to pay a bonus, a profit, to them\nfor the privilege.\nj The bankers know the same thing about these Victory\nbonds.\nThey know that in a few weeks or a few months you will\ndecide to invest your savings and that then they will be able\nto sell you at a profit the rock solid promises of Uncle Sam\nwhich you can buy today as cheaply as they can.\nThis last loan should be just as much a popular loan, a\npeople’s loan, as any that preceded it. It should be even more\na popular loan because it bears a higher rate of interest and\nso gives you a better return.\nIf you have got any money in your pocket put it all into\n; Victory bonds.\ni\nIf you haven’t any ready money, but have a salary, make\narrangements at some bank to buy your bonds a little at a\ntime, so much a weejc or so much a month. It will teach you\nto save money, one of the most valuable lessons you can learn.\nUnder any conditions buy as many bonds as you havo\nready money to pay for, and then bind yourself to buy as\nmany more as you think you can possibly spare the money to«\npay for in the coming year.\nIt isn’t a charity you are subscribing to. It’s business\nproposition of buying for yourself the best security ever of\nfered at the lowest price it will ever be sold to you.\nI !|:\n® s\n•:*$ ■■_ _ JB\n_n\nI\nTHEY DID NOT WHIMPER\nI- ■ • . • • . J \'\nIn one of the advertisements urging pople to subscribe\nto the Victory Loan, is the line. “Never Once Did They Whim\nper.” We believe it is the most inspiring phrase that has been\ncoined since the war began, or since we got, into the war.\nCertainly it pays the grandest tribute that has so far been\npaid to these boys of ours who put on the uniform—and it is\nan actual truth. No one has heard these soldiers whimper;\nthe surgeons who attended them at the hospitals in the field,\nthe nurses who ministered to the torn and battered men who\nlimped or were carried to the operating tables, will tell you\nthat there was no whimpering among them.\nThese boys did not complain that becapse the govern\nment was wasting a lot of money, they proposed laying down\ntheir guns. They did not whimper that because somebody\nelse had gotten rich out of the war, they would cease to fight. •\nThey did not protest at going forward in the face of the enemy\n, because there was somebody else who ought also to go for\nward. They did not whimper.\nBut there is whimpering here at this time—not among\nthose who made the fight. They are whimpering that some\nbody else has not bought as many of the Victory notes as he\n* should. They are whimpering that the last issue of Liberty\nbonds is not selling on the open market at their face value.\nThey are whimpering that they had to pay an income tax.\nThey are whimpering that the government is taking away\nfrom them part of the money they made while these soldiers\nwere dying for them on the field of battle. They are whim\npering about politics, and about a league of nations— as if\nthey understood anything about a league of nations—and a\ndozen things that do not amount to anything to them person\nally. But these soldiers of ours—those who fought and died„\nthose who fought and lived—never once did they whimper!\ni____ I\nThis space donated by the following progressive and pa- I\ntriotic business.men of Brandon, who are interested in seeing\nRankin go over the top.\nW.

Next he\nwas transferred to Chickamauga\nPark, Ga., and became a part of\nthe 5th Division, having been\nplaced in Company G of the 11th.,\nInfantry. The initial training in\nthe camp was the same as in the\nother army camps though the In\nfantry had much harder drill\nthan some arms of the service,\nlong hours being devoted to bayo\nnet practice, trench warfare, and\nconstant drill.\nThe remainder of the narrative\nis written just as if he were\nspeaking, for the message is his.\nSeven months after I entered\nthe- service, or about April 1,\n1918, orders were received that\nwe were ~to go over sea, and we\nleft for Camp Merritt, N. J.\nWhile there we were fully\nequipped for our oversea service,\nand every one was just as anxi\nous to go as a child is to leave on\na picnic. Two weeks was taken\nup at Camp Merritt, and from\nthere we took train to New York,\nand boarded the Leviathan, ohce\nthe German ship, the. Vaterland\n(the Fatherland) the largest\nship afloat. This ship is more\nthan mine hundred feet long,\neamrinc m • normal number ten\nto twelve thousand men, but it\nis said that\'20,000 have been on\nit at one time.. When there is\nsuch a large number, the soldiers\ncannot all be accommodated with\nsleeping “bunks”, so they are di\nvided into three shifts, each one\nsleeping eight hours a day and\nas soon as he leaves his cot, an\nother one takes it. In this way,\na soldier had to sleep whenever\nhis time came.\nThe ship was alone—without\neven a convoy—until three days\nout of Brest, then we were met\nand convoyed in. Because of a\nzigzag course, and great speed,\nthe ship was enabled to safely\nelude the watching undersea\ncraft.\nWe stayed at Brest for about a\nweek, being quartered at Pontan\nezen Barracks. The weather was\nfair, and the camp, which in the\nwet season is so terrible, was\nj reasonably dry.\nAfter the brief stay at Brest,\nwe were loaded on box cars, and\ncarried northeast of Paris to a\nlittle town Eclonce, about forty\nfive miles from the front. Here\nwe had constant drill. New\nequipment was issued to us—the\nequipment we would need in the\nvery near future. We were given\nFrench automatic rifles, with the\ntripod—making the gun easy to\nshoot, but hard to carry. We\nspent two or three weeks here,\nand all our time was used at in\nfantry drill getting us ready for;\nthe fray.\nWe could hear thte firing of the\nlong range 14 inch naval or coast\ndefense guns, that had been\nbrought up, and moved backward\non railroad cars. These big guns,\nshowing up at unexpected places\nand times, and making jbuch\nhavoc when fired made the Ger\nmans feel mighty blue, and did\nvery much to undermine the\nmorale of the German army*\n^Ihthis sector^\nxwere seen. Of course, there were\ni \\ few enemy observation balloons\na nd scout plane\'s.\nWe dwelt in the French barns,\nan d slept on the ground, except\nwhv hi we were fortunate enough\nto s teal some hay from some\nFren ch farmhouse and used it\nfor a bed. The ground here was\nwet, ai caused great\' inconveni\nences ti7 the\' men. The nights\nwere coc^ anu we needed plenty\nj For !\nI I\ni Graduati ng j\nMUBiMlWWWi\nGifts...\n1 LaV ARLIERES\nWHIST WATCHE!\nof cover. Each man had four <\nblankets, and usually we slept\ndoubter—each two men having 1\neight blankets—two on the :\nground for a bed, and six used ;\nfor cover.\nWe depended on the French for\nrations. They gave us coffee,\nhard bread or hard “tack” as we\ncalled it, and French corned\nbeef, a product very inferior to\nthe American corned beef. We\ngot enough to eat, though the\nquantity and quality and variety\ndid not please ns. From this\nplace, we went to St. Marice,a\nsmall village in the mountains\nnear the Swiss border, just two\ndays hike from the front.\nBesides our pack which con\ntained all our clothing and blank\nets, we carried reserve rations,\ntwo Bandoleers 30-30 lifle am\nmunition, one belt full of cart\nridges, a trench knife, bayonet,\ncanteen of water, first aid packet,\n45 revolver and ammunition for\nsame, and a pick or shovel or\nsome trench tool. Each man\ncarried a rifle.\nEight men makes a squad.\nNumbers one, two and three in\nthe front rank carried a shovel,\nsame numbers in^ the rear rank\ncarried a pick, while number four\nin the rear rank carried an axe,\nand in the front rank, number\nfour, the corporal, carried a pair\nof pliers. Thus you can easily see\nthat the burden of a soldier was\nnot very light.\nAbout June 10, we moved up. to\nCamp LeMoin, one and one\nfourth miles from the front, and\nunder fire of the enemy\'s artil:\nlery. We felt a little shaky and\ni nervous, as this was our first ex\nperience undpr fire, but we were\nI determined and stood our ground.\nI The barracks were all shot to\ni pieces, the ground torn up, and\nthe men living in dugouts.\nMost of the men kept under\ncover. White there, One of our\nlinner for our men.\nWe were the first Americans on\ns\n;his sector, having been sent up\n;o relieve the French. The am\nbulances and hospital trains\nkept ‘/moving back, bearing the\nFrench wounded the first aid sta\n;ions, from whence they were\nsent to hospitals farther back.\nSome of the wounded were in\nte|rible conditions, /though you\ncannot realize what butchery\nwar is unless you have experienc\ned it.. The French moved about\nsteadily and firmly, having grown\naccustomed to it all.\nWe stayed in the dugouts at\nLeMoin for two nights and a day.\nAs we were making our way from\nLemoin to the front line trenches\nour forces were heavily shelled,\nbut ineffectively. We were mov\ning slowly, at night and the\nwhite star shells were sent up,\nin an effort to locate any bodies\nof moving troops.%\nAll the Germans were surpris\ned when they found that the A\nmericans opposed them on the\nfront.\nWe kept Uji> a steady advance\nthrough the artillery swept field\nand made the last quarter of a\nmile in the zigzag communicating\ntrenches, Where we were safe\nfrom machine gun and rifle fire.\nAs we advanced through the wet\nand muddy trenches, our prog\nress was often hampered by the\ntelephone wires along the sides\nof the trenches.\nThe trenches were dhg from\nthree to ten feet deep, depending\nupon the way the ground lay.\nWe stayed up hfere for fourteen\ndays. The sector being very\nquiet, we had little fighting to do.\nMdst of the work was patrol or\nguard duty. V*\nHalf a platoon, or about thirty\nmen, guarded about one hundred\nyards of trench.\nWe had no air here,\never they wished. The artillery\nkept up an intermittent firing to\nlet us know tjiat the Germans\nwere still on the job.\nOne day I was firing at a sen\ntry near the enemy lines, and our\nplatoon commander was by me,\nand by means of field glasses, ob\nserving the effects of my shots\nand directing my firing. While he\nwas looking, an enemy snipi\ntook a shot at him, struck tl\nlens of the glasses and broke\nand the > bullet grazed his hea\nbut did not injure him serious!\nWe soon got accustomed to tl\nfighting, hnd took the firing ai\ndestruction as a matter of eour\nin warfare.\n(Continued on page four)\nTHE LADIES\nAte cordially invited\nto see our new line of\nBON TON\nCORSETS\nII ‘\n| Something new and elegant.\n| have them in white and\n| flesh, front and hack lace, all\nS new models and lengths, all\n| sizes.

Buy Vic\ntory Bonds.\nRankin county has always dis\ncharged in a creditable manner\nevery patriotic obligation, and we\nknow that our citizens will not\nfail in the Victory Loan, the last\npublic bond issue to be floated.\nThe bonds pay 4% per cent,\nwhich makes the investment very\nattractive. Let’s finish the job,\ngentlemen, by all means.\nThe success of the victory Loan\nshould be the uppermost thought\nin every mind, till the drive goes\nover the top. This is the last loan\nthat the government will ask for,\nand it behooves every one to do\nthe best he can. The investment\nis a good one, both from a finan\ncial and patriotic standpoint. The\nbonds pay four andthree-quar\nters per cent internet. Money\ncan be borrowed for the purchase\nof bonds at six percent. So it\nwill be seen that the purchaser\ninvests four and three-fourths\ni\nper cent in money and only one\nand a quarter per cent in patrio\ntism. Any man ought to be able\nto do that.

Hol\nland will be requested to surrend\ner the royal refugee for arraign\nment before a court composed of\nfive judges named by the United\n, States, Great Britain, France, It\nly and Japan.\nThe State Department made\npublic proposed articles for in\nsertion in the peace treaty, to be\nconsidered by the peace confer\nence in plenary session, provid\ning for trial of William II of\nHohenzollern, and also requiring\nGermany to deliver all persons\nwithin its borders charged with\n“having exercised acts in viola\ntion of the laws and customs of\nwar,” for arraignment before\nmilitary tribunals of the Allied\nand associated powers whose na\ntionals suffered through such of\nfenses.\nThus the peace conference\ncommission on responsibility for\nthe war has solved its most\nweighty problem. The State De\npartment’s announcement of the\nsolution was received here gen\nerally with surprise, because it\nwas known /that Secretary Lan\nsing, chairman of the committee,\nhas steadfastly opposed any at\ntempt to bring the former kaiser\nbefore an international tribunal.\nMr. Lansing contended there was\nno law by which such an offender\ncould be reached by the confer\nence and that it would be con\ntrary to the constitution of the\nUnited States for the American\ndelegation to participate in the\nexecution of that sort of interna\ntional ex-post-facto law at that\ntime, however, it was proposed to\ncharge criminal and military of\nfenses, and it was suggested to\nday that the descision to base the\nindemnity upon » international\nmorality and the sancity of trea\nties was taken to meet the Ameri\ncan viewpoint.\nList of Offenses\nOffenses listed against the\nmilitary forces of the Central\nPowers, it is saic^ may be group\ned under three general heads,\ncrimes against opposing armies;\ncrimes against opponents in mar\nine industry; crimes against non\ncombatants and civilians.\nUnder the first group would\ncome the employing of “projec\ntiles which have for their only\nobject the diffusion of asphyxiat\ning or deleterious gases.”\nProhibited rn the Hague con\nvention of 1899, use of mushroom\nbullets and other weapons tend\ning to cause unnecessary suffer\ning; prohibited in the Hague con\nference of 1907, destruction, of\nRed Cross and battleship person\nnel and material, pollution of\nwater supply sources, and misuse\nof flags of truce.\nCrimes committed by the en\nemy’s naval forces which would\nrender individuals cupable, who\ncaused the sinking without warn\ning of merchant craft, destruc\ntion under any conditions of life\nboats and rafts laden with sur\nvivors.\nOffenses against civilian popu-\'\nlations of occupied districts ifi\nclude imprisoning enemy sub\njects enmasse; expulsion of civ\nilians from occupied territory;\nuse of prisoner labor on opera\ntions directly connected with the\nwar; internment under condi\ntons of hardship; compulsory en\nlistments; debasement of cur\nrency; wanton destruction of\nproperty; abrogation of civil\ngovernment.\nNew articles proposed for in\nsertion in the peace treaty, to be\nconsidered at the plenary ses\nsion of the peace conference the\nState Department announced, in\nclude the followin\'\nArticle 1. The Allied and as\nsociated powers publicity ar\nraign William II of Hohenzollern\nformerly German emperor, not\nfor an offense against criminal\nlaw, but for a supreme offense a\ngainst international morality and\nthe sanctity of treaties. .\nIt is proposed that a special\ntribunal be constituted to try the\naccused, consisting of five judges\none appointed by each of the five\ngreat powers—the United States,\nGreat Britain, France, Italy and\nJapan.\nThe Allied and associated\npowers will request Holland to\nsurrender the former emperor\nfor trial.\nPersons accused of the viola\ntion of the laws and customs of\nwar, according to a second pro\nposed article, will be brought be\nfore military tribunals, and if\nfound guilty, “sentenced to the\npunishments laid down by mili\ntary law.” / * "\nAll persons accused of having\ncommitted an act in violation of\nthe laws and customs of war who\nare specified “either by name or\nment for trial by the military\ntribunal of the powers against\nwhose nationals the criminal acts\nwere perpetrated.\n-——\nSt. Aignan, France.March 16,\n1919.—My dear Dad and all:\nWell it is Sunday again and I can\nsee you all as you are gathered\ntogether at the church at home\nand I know your prayers and\nthoughts are of me over here and\nlet me assure you that on such\noccasions my heart and thoughts\nare there with you. And when 1\nreturn I will jiot come back the\nsame thoughtless boy that you\nsent away, but a man. Not in\nyears and physique perhaps, but\nin experience. Yes, and with a\nfull determination to persue some\nworthy cause in life and to try to\nbe a leader of men instead of a\nfollower.\nI do not know when I will leave\nhere, but when I leave I will be\non my way to the good old U. S.\nA., and to my home and loved\nones where I know I will receive\nsuch a welcome as few returning\nsons will get. You cannot imag\nine our longing for home. As\nlong as our country needs\'us we\nare ready and willing to stay and\nserve, but now that our task is\ndone and as every body says it is\ndone well; then we are anxious\nto come home and as we wait the\ntime hangs heavy on our hands,\nand we get home sick, lonely and\nblue. Killing time is a much\nharder job than killing Germans.\nI think if some of our political\nwarmers over there, who cry\n“Look what the boys did”, would\nget up and do something else be\nsides knock on President Wilson\na ndthe League of Nations, and\ndebate about what the soldiers\nshall wear on their uniform when\nthey come back; then we would\nall be better off and probably get\nhome mubh faster. It will be\nbest for them to never appear in\npublic life again, for if they do,\nthere is going to be a great num\nber of them who will be sadly\ndisappointed. There are two and\none-half million men over here\nand they are coming home to rule\nand not to be ruled by just any\nlittle old sap.\nGuess it is getting warm there\nnow. It is rather cold over here\nyet, but with good indications\nthat spring will soon open.\nHow are all the people at\nhome? Give my best love to\nMother, Sis, and the boys. I am\nreal anxious for a letter from\nhome. Two months without a let\nter sure makes a fellow lonely. I\nI have written to the battery for\nmy mail so guess it will be sent\nhere to me in a few days. Then\nwant I be glad!\n! Will stop now. Write^ to me\nsoon, although I may be on my\nway home when you get this.\nWith lots of love,\nYour affectionate son,\nWilkes.\n■\nBID EATERS GET\nKIDNEY TROUBLE\nTake Salts at first sign of Bladder\nirritation or Back ache.\n*\nThe American men and women\nmust guard constantly against\nKidney trouble, because we eat\ntoo much and all our food is rich.\nOur blood is filled with uric acid\nwhich the kidneys strive to filter\nout, they weaken from over-work,\nbecome sluggish; the eliminative\ntissues clog and the result is kid\nney trouble, bladder weakness\nand a general decline in health.\nWhen your kidneys feel like\nlumps of lead; your back hurts\nor the urine is cloudy, full of\nsediment or you are obliged to\nseek relief two or three times\nduring the night; if you suffer\nwith sick headache, or you have\nrheumatism when the weather is\nbad, get from your pharmacist a\nbout four ounces of Jad Salts;\ntake a tablespoonful in a glass\nof water before breakfast for a\nfew days and your kidneys will\nthen act fine. This famous sdlts\nis made from the acid of grapes\nand lemon juice, combined with\ngenerations to flush and stimu\nlate clogged kidneys; to neutra\nlize the acids in the urine so if\nno longer is a source of irritation\nthus ending bladder disorders.\nJad Salts is inexpensive; can\nnot injure, makes a delightful\neffervescent lithia-water bever\nage, and belongs in every home\nbecause nobody can make a mis\ntake by having a good kidney\nflushing any time.\n-L-*\n— - -- -- w — — v v-w- « v v v ■ wmm w w w m w m m wm w w w \\\n■ SPRING TIME\nI \'\nSpring Time Goods At Our Store.
