The debate was\nvery general, and brought out the fact\nthat the senate was strongly opposed to\ncloture In any form The house, by o\nmajority of 2 to 1, rejected the confer\nence report on the army appropriation\nbill because of its provisions (or the re\ntirement of civil war officers at an ad\nvanced grade and permitting officers to\ndeposit money with the government at\nthree per cent.

Feb, 12. Booker T.\nWashington addressed a large and ap\npreciative audience tonight at the\nAcademy ot Music, Brooklyn. The au\ndieice was composed principally of\nwhites, though there were a good\nmany of his own race. He said:\n"The negro problem, which Is now\ngitating a great many people in the\nUnited States, can only be solved If it\nla approached coolly and deliberately,\nas are all other great questions of th\nday. All anger must be put aside,\nprejudices must be forgotten, and af\nter calm deliberation, what will result\nIn the greatest good to both whites\nand blacks must be agreed upon."\nHe waracd his race that they shovld\nnot foel discouraged because their\ncause had not advanced aa rapidly\nduring the last twenty-five years as\nthey hadjioped it would, but that they\nmust wait patiently and Justice would\nbe done to all concerned. Continuing,\nhe Bald:\n"If any of the leading thinkers had\nbeen told, when the negro was first\nbrought to this couitry, that he would\never be granted the franchise, they\nwould have laughed. And if it had\nbeen suggested that a negro would\never be class speaker at Yale and Har\nvard, they would have thought it the\nvagary of a disordered mind ; yet such\nthings have come to pass."\nIn closing he urged that a conven\ntion be called to meet at an early\ndate, which would be composed of the\nleading men of both races, North and\nSouth, and decide what was best to be\ndone ii the premises.\nALABAMIAN\'S ELOPEMENT.\nCoL Beldon, of Montgomery, Marries a\nChicago (llrl and Her Mother\nIs Wrathy.\nChicago, Feb. 22.

Selden of Montgom\nery, Ala. "My daughter will not be\n18 years old for five months, and per\njured herself to get the license. I\nwill have them followed. Why\' the\nman is 58 years old, that is old enough\nto be her grandfather."\nThe fact that the bridegroom is\nwealthy, a oousin, as he says, of Mayor\nHarrison, and himself a politician of\nprominence, does not reconcile the\nmother to the marriage performed\nwithout her knowledge. The pair met\nin Buffalo during the exposition. Mrs.\nPowell learned Selden was a widower\nand a grandfather. Selden arrived in\nthe city yesterday and met the girl la\ntne home of a woman friend, procured\na license and was married In two\nhours,, and left for the South. A dis\npatch from Montgomery tonight says:\n"Capt. William L. Selden is connected\nwith the State commission of agrlcul-\nture.

The\nbasis for the proposed legislative com\nplaint is that these three lines are par\nallel and competitive, although they\nare situated some, distance apart and\nthat their acquirement by another\ncompany even in part cannot be done\nexcept by conseit of the legislature.\nOfficial announcement has already\nbeen made that the Texas & New Or\nleans Railroad Company ; would make\napplication to the legislature to sell\nthat portion of its road between Sa\nbine Pass and Dallas to the Rock is\nland but similar information has not\ncome from the two other roads that\nare reported to be parties to me aeai.\nCALCIUM SALTS CURE.\nDr. Jacques Loeb Thinks It a Dead Shot\nfor St. Vltnl)ance and otner\nKervons Diseases.\nChicago, Feb. 22.

Announcement of this\ndiscovery in scientific research by th\nformer head of the departmeit ot\nDhvsiology at the University of Chi\ncago has been made. In a recent pub\nlication Issued by the University of\nrhlcaeo Press, Dr. Loeb concludes\nthat the presence of calcium salts in\nthe muscles is what prevents men\ntwitehlne: that practically ail ner\nvous diseases are cauaed by the ab\nsence of the calcium, and, therefore,\nconditions ana erreci\na cure, the remedy is to dose with cal\ncium salts. ,\nWHEAT CROP IN DANGER.\nThousand, of Acre.

It\nwin be recalled that there has been\ndispute between the two officials\nover a settlement of poll taxes. The\nmenu nas t lie receipt of the treas\nurer for the money and the treasur\ner contends that the receipt is an\nerror and that the money was never\npaid over in fact. The case has\nbeen in the Supreme Court and was\nrecently ?nt back for a new trial.\nIn order to have the new trial it\nseems necessary to issue new writs,\nand the question now arises who is\nto serve the writs. The sheriff, be\ning a party to the suit, is disquali\nfied to serve them. Under the law\nthe coroner ami ranger would lie the\npropr man to serve the writs in such\ncase, but there is no coroner and\nranger in the county. The coroner\nresigned his otlice many months ago\nbecause it did not pay enough to\nbuy postage for the necessary corre\nspondence, and the board of super\nvisors has never thought it of\nenough consequents to worry about\n.Now, however, it will be necessary\nfor the hoard to order a special elec\ntion and elect a coroner and ranger\nto servo the writs in the present\ncase.\nOpening- of Veterans\' Heine.\nIt seems likely that the I?eauvoir\nhome Will not be opened for the vet\nerans as soon ns at first expected.\nAfter the purchase was made it was\ngenerally understood that the home\nwould be opened at once with the\nmoney that the Daughters of the\nConfederacy have on hand for that\npurpose, but it is now learned that\nCommander McKay is not in favor\nof opening the home until the bal\nance of the purchase money is paid.\nThe Daughters arc very anxious to\nhave the home opened at once, but\nthe money they have on hand is ex\npressly appropriated by resolution\nto the opening of the home and can\nnot be ftsed for the purchase fjnid.\nA Costly Campalfn.\nIt is estimated that it will cost\nthe man who is elected governor of\nMississippi this year not less than\n$10,000 in campaign expenses. The\ngubernatorial candidates arc spend\ning very little money with the State\npress, and there is much complaint\namong the editors, who think that\nthe candidates should publish offi\ncial announcements in each county.\nThe editors are doomed to disap\npointment, not only as concerns the\ncandidates for governor, but aspir\nants for other State offices, for few\nof the men in the field are finan\nciallyl able to incur this expense.\nSo far as the gubernatorial candi\ndates are concerned, most of them\nare fairly well supplied with this\nworld\'s goods, and the expenses of\nthe campaign will not be a heavy\nburden.\nTo Retire Bond..\nAt its next meeting the ci(y coun\ncil of Jackson will have to nnike ar\nrangements to retire or refund a\nbond issue in the sum of $8,100\nheld by Judge J. A. T. Campbell,\nrepresenting the purchase price of\nthe property on which the central\nschool building is located. The to\ntal issue of bonds for the central\nschool was $23,400, and the sum of\n$15,000 is outstanding in addition\nto the bonds held by Judge Camp\nbell. The $15,000 issue, however,\nis not due for five years. It is like\nly that the council will arrange for\na refund of the $8,400 at 5 per cent.\nThe issue is now drawing 6 per\ncent.\nRailroad Commission.\nThe railroad commission held its\nregular semi-monthly session in\nJackson last week, and disposed of a\nsmall amount of routine business.\nThe first matter brought up was the\npetition of the citizens of Meridian\nfor a flat rate of three and one-half\ncents per hundred from Vicksburg\nto that place on grain and grain pro\nducts. The commission deferred ac\ntion until the next meeting. The\npetition for a depot at New Augusta\nwas postponed until the next meet\ning. The matter of a joint confer\nence with the traffic officials of the\nvarious railroads operating in the\nState for the purpose of arranging\na new local rate classification will\nnot be taken up for some time.\ni Go-A head Elllsrtlla.\nEllisville, in Jones county, is one\nof the most entreprising towns in\nMississippi. According to the 1M\nlisville News, the wide-awake news\npaper of the town, there is a move\nment on to get a cotton factory, and\nthe enterprising citizens have gone\nabout the business in the spirit\nwhich means success inevitably.\nOne enterprising citizen rrakes a\ntender of free fuel and free water\nto run the mill and will take $20,\nO00 of the etocL\nStat Tlsaoer Scare.\nStave manufacturers in Mississip\npi are worried over the rapidly di\nminishing supply of white oak tim\nber, and they are now being forced\nto haul the lgs long distances to\nrailroad points or navigable streams,\nwhere they can be shipped to the\npoints of manufacture. The white\noak timber along the water courses\nin the State has been thinned out in\nmany places for distances of more\nthan twenty-five i.iiles from the\npaths of transportation, and the\nprice of stave timlier has boon more\nthan doubled during the past few\nI years. Staves which sold at $150\nper mill 1,200 staves ten years\nago, are now hard to get at prices\nranging form $250 to $3 2 5, and the\nindications arc that there will be an\nother sharp advance in prices dur\ning the present winter. The supply\nof white oak is becoming especially\nscarce in the 1\'earl river valley, and\nthe demand was never greater than\nnow.\nSmug-glad Tools luto Jail.\nLee Armstrong, a mulatto girl,\nwas arrested last week and placed in\nthe county jailnt llazlehurst on tho\ncharge of" smuggling tools and as\nsisting prisoner in their attempt to\nbreak out of joil on the night of\nFebruary 7.

Eiutor.\nAs remarked in your issue of ten\nday ago tha letter of the law for\nbids any neighborhood to do any\nthing more or better for its own\nchildren, in the way of affording\nschool privileges, than it does for\nthe negro children thereof. In oth\ner words we are forbidden to tax\nourselves to maintain a nine months\nschool uuless we be willing to do\nthe same for the negroes. Even\nthis privilege is accorded only those\nwho live iu a municipal or "sepa\nrate school district," unless indeed\nthe Board of Supervisors determine\nthis for the whole county. Right\nhere is where I think it both wise\nand just to make a change. I would\nsuggest kgal enactments conferring\non each school district, either while\nor black, withiu our state the priv\nilege of taxing itself for any desired\nlength of session over and above\nthe four months term which our\nconstitution declares the state mvst\nprovide for. At present, this priv\nilege of school taxation is granted\nonly to couuties aud to separate\nschool districts. If we can make\nof each school district a basic unit\nof the public school system by de\nfining a school district to include\nwithin boundaries laid off by the;\nBoard of School commissioners, all\nthe property, real and personal, of\nthe population, who by virtue of\ntheir color may, by existing laws,\nhave their children attend such\nschool, and then confer on such\npopulation cettain means of taxing\nthemselves for their school. If this\nbe done it would afford a solution,\nto a certain extent, of our present\ntroubles. I doubt not there are\nmany white districts who would\nNOT make use CI this privilege;\nand I also btlicve there are many\ncolored districts that WociD cheer\nfully tax themselves for their\nschools.\nll is human uature for people to !\nappreciate that w hich costs some- i\nthing, and every neighborhood thus \'\ntaxing itself would be far more in- j obnfrfe! timt tlii re medy eotmteraots\ntenstediuits school work than is! r ,om,et,CT of Um" t\n.1. ... - .t ru rennrmnia.
