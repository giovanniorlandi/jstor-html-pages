Subscribers to\nthe Chicago Telephone Co. may think\nthey are not interested in the matter\nof the \'phone trust taking over the\nautomatic, but they ARE.\nIt is proposed that the Bell \'phone\ntrust shall take over the \'phone plant\nof the tunnel company and pay for it\n$6,300,000, that money will come out\nof the pockets of the subscribers of\nthe Chicago Telephone Co. For un\nder the terms of its franchise the Chi\ncago Co. has the right to add this\namount to its capitalization; and\nthat means \'phone rates would be\ncharged that would pay the interest\non the additional capitalization.\nI can\'t see why council should se\nriously consider granting the request\nof the two \'phone companies and give\nthe city\'s consent to the merger. The\ncity will get nothing in return for the\ngrant ad will put its own neck in\nthe noose of the \'phone trust.\nBesides, council would throw away\nthe best chance any large city in the\ncountry has to establish a municipal\n\'phone system, with a \'phone in every\nhome and the best possible service at\na penny a call.\nThere is no doubt in my mind\nabout the tunnel company having\nforfeited not only its telephone rights,\nbut its telephone system as well.\nThere are two forfeiture clauses in\nthe original grant; one .forfeits the\nplant to the city if the automatic\nhasn\'t 20,000 bona-fide subscribers;\nthe other provides for forfeiture if\nthe tunnel company sells out to any\nother \'phone company or enters into\nan agreement to sell out.\nThe automatic is actually serving\n20,000 bona-fide subscribers and it\nhas entered into an agreement to sell\nits plant to another \'phone company;\nfor both companies are asking coun\ncil to give the city\'s consent to a sale\nalready agreed upon as to terms.\nIt means millions to the \'phone\ntrust to get the city\'s consent; JautJt\nalso means millions to \'phone users\nfor council to refuse to give that con\nsent, and tp go ahead and establish\na municipal \'phone system, using the\ninfinitely superior automatic service.\nIt Pays to Be Rich.

While I do not question that your\nmotive in publishing the article is the\nbest, the tenor of the same does the\nworkers -who are involved a great in\njustice. There is no gainsaying the fact\nthat the employers, not only in Butte\nbut elsewhere, will always take ad\nvantage of any discord within the\nranks of the workers. The tone of\nyour article, however, leaves the im\npression that the blame for this ad\nvantage accruing to the employers\nmust of necessity fall upon the work\ners who rebel against corruption\nwithin their organization.\nThe truth of the matter is quite\ncontrary to any such conclusion.\nWhen the officials of an organization,\nin their zeal to prove their worth to\nthe employers, conduct the affairs of\nan organization so that the members\nare injured to the extent that the re\nsentment against their own organiza\ntion or rather, their efforts to\nstraighten out the affairs of their or\nganization for injuries suffered\nleads them to revolt en masse, the\nblame must fall altogether on the of\nficialdom and not on the members.\nIt is the officials and not the members\nwho are making it possible for the\nemployers to profit from division in\nthe ranks of the workers.\nThe miners of Butte have suffered\na long train of abuse and betrayal\nfrom the officials of the Butte Miners\'\nUnion, officials who have been elect\ned and kept in office through the\nmanipulation of elections, fraud and\ncorruption engineered by the mining\ncompanies\' agents within the union,\nthe use of thugs and violence.\nA few examples are not out of\nplace.\nSome timcngo .the. mining com\npanies introduced the rustling card in\nButte. This is the initial step toward\nblacklisting all undesirable workers\nthose who strive for better condi\ntions. The members of Butte miners\'\nunion voted 11 to 1 against working\nunder that system of employment.\nBut through the officials of the local\nthe card system was put in opera\ntion in spite of the membership.\nOnce in operation the officials of\nthe local worked hand in hand with,\nthe company in eliminating the unde\nsirables. Any member who opposed\nthe corruption of the local officials\nwas obligingly kept out of work, or\nat best but allowed to work short\ntime by the pompany official who\ndealt out the rustling-cards.\nThe accounts of the union- were\nshort a large sum of cash. The\nmembers were told that the rats had\ngot into the safe and destroyed the\nmoney.\nWhen the regular election for of\nficers took place the membership\nfound that the judges of such elec\ntion were picked by a meeting packed\nwith company supporters and ruled\nby thug methods. Necessity forced\nthem to meet the company element\nat their own game force. It is to\nthe credit of the members that they\nhad the necessary backbone to give\nthem success.\nIn the past the officials of the W\nF. M. have paid no heed to the ap\npeals from the members, notwith\nstanding the fact that the constitu\ntion of the organization gave them\nample power to interfere and pre\nserve the integrity of the organiza\ntion. But when the workers,\nthrough desperation, are forced to\nact in self-preservation and are suc\ncessful Moyer appears upon the scene\nwith a weak-kneed compromise\nproposition that would only mean a\nnew lease of life to the company ele\nment.

The words came low but\ndistinct to his ears:\n"Anticipated, but discounted."\n"H\'m !" muttered the fireman, in a\ndissatisfied way, and wearily contin\nued his forced attitude of "hands up!"\nFrom the first the fireman had not\nbeen in love with his task. This was\na branch of the great Mexican trunk\nline. For a month it had not turned a\nwheel. The district was in a tearful\nturmoil. In the insurrectionists held\nfull sway. Fire and sword ravaged the\ncountry and business had come to a\ncomplete stop.\nThe terminus of the branch line\nwas Ixtacl, and here there was a\nlittle bank. It was owned by Henry\nMorse, who operated a larger insti\ntution in a good-sized city just over\nthe Texas state line. The engineer of\nthe present "special" was not an engi\nneer. However, for two years, back\nin his life, he has "worked on the\nroad." .He had gained some practical\nexperience thereby.\nThe result was that when the anx\nious banker tried to get the railroad\ncompany to send a special to Ixtacl\nand bring thence the little bank safe\ncontaining important documents and\ncash, and found no one willing to un\ndertake the dangerous mission, Al\nbion Marvin stepped to the front.\nThe railroad company lured by an\nindemnity bond and a goodly amount\nof money, agreed to furnish an engine\nand steel express car.

They laughed in\ntheir sleeves, however.\n"That loot will never leave Mexican\nterritory," they predicted.\nTen miles, fifteen miles, twenty\nmiles the train progressed. Then the\nsignal, the armed Mexican and engi\nneer and fireman challenged and\nhelpless, as seen.\nThe Mexican did not speak further.\nHe kept his weapons leveled as if pos\ning for a picture. Suddenly, however,\nhe opened his lips. It was to give ut\nterance to a shrill, piercing whistle.\nIts echoes had scarce died away\nwhen in the near distance the lynx\neyed engineer observed half a dozen\narmed men descending the cut side\nfrom a covert.\nThen his glance studied the waiting\nsentinel with, increasing sharpness.\nHe took in his position, his face, he\nreckoned as to the time it would take\nfor his accomplices to reach the rail\nroad cut.\nThe fireman, closely scrutinizing\nhis comrade, fancied he tracked a\nquick glitter in his clear, scrutinizing\neyes. The engineer seemed calculat\ning. Their challenger was just in\nrange of the exhaust cock. In fact,\nnot five feet \'away from it his face\nwas directly upon a leVel with it.\nThe little valve that operated this\nwas just at the side of the engineer.\nPressure would set it going.

His\nelbow met the extending valve.\nHiss ss splutter a blood-curdling\nscream. Straight Into the face\nof the unsuspecting Mexican went a\nscalding deluge. Blinded, blistered, in\nagony, he dropped both revolvers. His\nhands went up to his tortured eyes.\n"Now, then!" shouted Marvin, and\nhe sprang to the lever. s\nA dozen shots from the bandits de\nscending the side of the cut rattled\nagainst the cab. A curve was turned.\n"Saved " uttered the fireman, with\ngrin and chuckle.\n"Hardly," qualified Marvin. "They\nwill try one more ambush, but if\nwe can make Sonoma "\n"Why, that is still fifty miles from\nthe junctilon.\n"If we can only make Sonoma!" re\npeated Marvin in a businesslike tone\nthat sounded hopeful to his puzzled\nassistant. "I thought so!" he added\nhalf an hour later, and slowed up\njust in time to avoid dashing into a\nbarricade of railroad ties piled across\nthe rails. This time six rough char\nacters surrounded the engine.\n"Cut off that car," ordered their\nleader,and Marvin obeyed.\n"Now, then, go on about your busi\nness," was the added command, and\nat a wave of the speaker\'s hand his\nsubordinates removed the obstacle on\nthe tracks.\nOpen-mouthed, dejected, the fire\nman stared at Marvin as he resumed\nhis duties. ,\n"See here," he- finaUy observed,\n"they\'ve got what they were after."\n"Yes, the express car?\' nodded\nMarvin gaily. "It will take them an\nhour to bur,st in that s\'teel door to get\ninto the big, safe. w\n"Well, then"\n"By that time we "shall be at So\nnoma."

On\nthe ability he exhibited in the Amer\nican League, both with the Mackmen\nand Yanks, Derrick would not have\nbeen a strong addition to the South\nSide troop.\nHe never shone as a hitter, and had\ndifficulty holding a thrown ball at sec\nond base, an unusual failing for a big\nleague infielder. In the International\nhe has been hitting around the .300\nmark, but the pitching in that circuit\nand the brand of twirling on exhibi\ntion in the American League this year\nare not comparative.\nIf Derrick couldn\'t make good two\nyears ago, he certainly would fail\nnow, for the twirlers in the Johnson\ncircuit have increased their efficiency\nat least 50 per cent, and the batters\nwho have made great records for\nyears are having trouble keeping\nwithin speaking distance of their\nformer marks.\nLarry Chappell would be a great\nhelp to the Sox now, but it is extreme\nly doubtful if the former Brewer will\nbe available for duty during the sea\nson.

The report from Cincinnati\nhas it that Snodgrass, Murray and\nprobably Merkle are to be traded to\nthe Reds for Hoblitzel, Bates, a claim\nto the services of Marsans, who jump\ned to the Feds, and possibly Niehoff.\nThe players involved cannot be\ndefinitely named, but a big shift is\nimminent.\nMcGraw is gambling that the new\nplayers, lifted to a team that has a\nchance for the world\'s series coin,\nwill play inspired baseball. It is a Jong\nchance, as Hobby now is batting\ndown near .200, and Bates was never\nnoted for his brightness.

FULLERTON.\nNov. 25, 1899. A bitter wind swept\nthe field at New Haven, wliere, mass\ned opposite sides of the great field,\nthirty thousand men and women\nstood, shrieking, screaming, singing\nand snouting.\nOn the soggy field below two teams,\nbattling to the point of exhaustion,\nbattered, broken, with substitutes\ntaking the place of the regulars,\nstruggled to the end of one of the\ngreatest games of football ever play\ned. Regulars, limping, crippled, ex\nhausted, with blood and mud-stained\nfaces, wept aloud as they were sup\nported from the field.\nYale was leading, 10 to 6, and the\nmasses of the Blue watched anxious\nly. Princeton had the ball, on a fum\nble, and more than twenty yards away\nthe Yale goal posts marked the limit\nof ambition for theTigers. It was the\nlast minute of play.\nOn the Princeton side great ban\nners flaunted, "Poe Did It." Four gen\nerations of Poes, heroes of Old Nas\nsau, had broken down Yale\'s defense,\nand on that scarred field another Poe\nArthur, the youngest of the great\nfamily, was limping, fighting, strug\ngling. Less than a minute remained for\nplay and Princeton was beaten. The\nball, acquired through a fumble, was\nin possession of the Tigers if Reiter\ncould get away for another spectacu\nlar run; if Big Wheeler could crush\nhis way through the battered Yale\nline.\nThe sons of Old Nassau stood and\nscreamed screamed for Poe to break\naway again for a run as he had done\nthe preceding fall when, dodging and\ntwisting, he had blasted Yale\'s hopes.\nBut it was not to be. Wheeler was\ncalled back. His head was cut, and\ngore was streaming over his battered\nand mud-stained face. He limped, but\nat the call he hurled his magnificent\nbody at the Yale line. The bull dog\nsprang to meet the assault. The line\nwavered, broke, rallied, and Wheeler\ncrashed down with a scant yard of\nthe\'precious ground gained. McCord\nwas called. Like a madman he tore\ninto the Yale tackle and was hurled\nback.\nTwenty-four yards away the goal\nposts loomed. Itwas third down and\nfive yards to gain. A scant half-minute\ntwenty-eight seconds, according\nto one timekeeper, remained. Already\nThe Yale songs of victory were aris\ning. A substitute, stripping his sweater\nas he raced, came tearing across the\nfield. Some one tapped Arthur Poe\non the shoulder and pointed. Poe\nwas to be taken out of the game and\na sub sent to kick in his place.\nLike a man demented, Poe turned\nupon them. His voice broke in sobs.\nHe fought. He refused to leave the\ngame. He demanded the right to kick.\nThe coaches were in despair. The\nsubstitute, mournfully replacing his\nsweater, walked back to the side lines\nand Poe dropped back twenty-eight\nyards from the goal.\nThen Yale remembered the Poes.\nThe Princeton clans arose and took\nup the cry, "Poe did it," "Poe did it."\nThe battered, frail-looking youth\ndropped back. The crowd held its\nbreath. In the center Bannard crouch\ned, bracing himself for the shock. The\nPrinceton line stiffened to hold\nagainst that last charge. Bannard\npassed the ball perfectly. Straight in\nto Poe\'s hands it went.\nAt the ends the Yale men charged.\nThe battered Princeton line held and\ninstantly broke under the fierceness\nof the attack but they had held long\nenough. Poe dropped the ball. It\nstruck the earth, bounded, and he\nswung his foot\nThe ball struck on his instep, too\nhigh rose, just out of reach of the\nblocking hands of the ends as they\n..tUtLjd.\n.yt j?r- - r.?\nWk', 'leaped.

His name is Patrick H. Dignan and,\naccording to the coroner\'s jury ver\ndict on June 24, he fired three bullets\nfrom a revolver and the first of these\nbullets struck George H. Hammond\nin the back of the head and killed\nGeorge Hammond. The two other\nbullets, extras to make sure of the\njob on an unarmed man, entered the\nbody. The jury verdict also said:\n"From the evidence presented, we,\nthe jury, recommend that Patrick H.\nDignan be held to the grand jury on\na charge of murder until discharged\nby due course of law."\nNo witnesses, no documents or oth\ner evidence was offered by Dignan\'s\nattorney before Judge McDonald in\nthe so-called gunman-\'s court on Mon\nday when Judge McDonald admitted\nDignan to bail.\nThe coroner\'s record of sixteen\nwitnesses who swore they saw Dig\nnan get out of a buggy and walk over\nto Hammond\'s automobile and shoot\nthree bullets into Hammond, and the\ntestimony of three witnesses that\nthere was no gun in the pockets of\nthe dead man just after the shooting,\nwas introduced by Assistant State\'s\nAtt\'y Barnhart.\n"The life of the defendant, Bignaivl\n1 was not in danger at any moment\naccording, to this evidence, which\nshows overwhelmingly that Dignan\'s\nact was deliberate," argued Barn\nhart. "No word was spoken between\nthe two men at the time of the shoot\ning. The man who was shot was not\nlooking toward his assailant at the\ntime the bullets struck him. At the\ntime Hammond was shot he had both\nhands on the steering wheel of his\nautomobile and his head turned away\nfrom Dignan. The hands of the dead\nman clung in death to the steering\nwheel, according to witnesses.\n"I can state positively to the court\nthat there is no evidence in all the\ncoroner\'s minutes of this case which\nwill show that the act of Dignan was\none of self-defense. We are opposed\nto the granting of bail in this case."\nThomas J. Dawson, attorney for\nDignan, argued that there had been\nseveral strikes against Dignan last\nyear and that Hammond was Blotting I\nanother strike, was making threats\nagainst Dignan, and a brother of Dig\nnan was told that Hammond was go\ning to get him.\nJudge McDonald granted the mo\ntion for bail and said:\n"In view of the general labor trou\nbles and considering the standing of\nthe accused man in the community, I\nwill take the responsibility of fixing\nthis man\'s bond at $25,000."\nA Day Book reporter asked Assist\nant State\'s Att\'y Barnhart yesterday\nwhether the granting of bond to Dig\nnan was in any way exceptional or\nquite in the ordinary course of events\nin bonding procedure. Barnhart cited\nthe Criminal Code, Div. Ill, 294:\n"Bailable Offenses. 1. All per\nsons shall be bailable before convic\ntion, except for canital offenses where\nthe proof is evident or the presump\ntion great."\nThe reporter said: "This means\nthen that Judge McDonald believes\nthe proof is not evident and the pre\nsumption is not great that Dignan\nmay have committed murder?"\nBarnhart replied: "The court, -has\nhjjWmt,K" !!\'.!\'\' yj?frT - t..,fc-fa.\niiJMMMJMftiiiaiiMiMB', 'r\nthe power to grant admission to bail\nin any case.

I am\nmerely trying to find out for readers\nof The Day Book whether there is a\nfixed rule of the courts in cases of\nthis kind. You argued before Judge\nMcDonald that it looked to you like\ndeliberate murder and there was no\nevidence showing self-defense. Is it\na fact that a court can grant bail to\na gunman who doesn\'t bring in any\nevidence of self-defense, proof that\nhe was in danger?"\n"It is in the discretion of the court\nto grant bail in any case, no matter\nwhat the evidence," replied the state\'s\nattorney\'s bonding specialist.\no o\nPOLICEWOMAN ARRESTS PAIR\nSUSPECTS WHITE SLAVERY\nPolicewoman Mary Crot of the S.\nClark street station will get into touch\nwith the federal authorities following\nthe arrest of a man and a girl, who\nclaim to be husband and wife, in the\nDearborn street station.\nThe policewoman saw the girl, with\nher hair in braids, wandering around\nthe railroad station July 6. After a\ntime a man joined the girl and they\nstarted off together.\nMiss Crot followed and stopped the\ncouple. She took the girl aside and\nquestioned her.

"Lieutenant\nJohn Porte is going to cross that At\nlantic ocean and he\'s going to cross\nit thfa summer and in the flying boat\nAmerica. And there is no doubt\nabout it, either."\nHenry Woodhouse, the greatest\nauthority in the world on marine fly\ning, pounded his fist on the desk in\nthe office of "Flying," the famous\naeronautic publication of which he is\neditor, and spoke these words. And\nthey are the most important words\nwhich have yet been uttered by any\none in connection with the proposed\nRodman Wanamaker trans-Atlantic I\nflight project, too, and for the simple\nreason that Henry Woodhouse is no\nrandom prophet He is considered\nabsolutely the most conservative\nthinker in America on the subject of\nflying.\n"I haver Just returned with Lieut.\nPorte from Hammondsport," said\nWoodhouse, "and I have made the\nmost .careful study of him and of his\nmachine.

The necessity for\nthese further developments should\nnot cause any embarrassment among\nthe promoters of the project; indeed\nthe fact that only such" light changes\nare necessary is absolute proof that\nthe trans-Atlantic flight undertaking\nhas developed remarkably fast and\nthe construction of an aeroplane\ncapable of crossing the Atlantic has\ntaken much less time than was\nimagined necessary by those who\nhave given thorough consideration to\nthe problem.\n"As it stands, the \'America\' repre\nsents an achievement much greater\nthan was thought possible within so\nshort a time," The most successful\nwater aeroplane ever built up to four\nmonths ago could carry only five pas\nsengers and fuel for four hours. The\nlarge European aeroplanes are all\nland aeroplanes and there are.no fly\ning boats capable of carrying more\nthan four passengers.\n"Making a flying boat capable of\ncarrying fuel and provisions for a\nflight of 24 hours and so constructed\nas to protect the pilot was a big un\ndertaking indeed; likewise to de\ndelop reliable motors. That being\nunderstood there was httle expecta\ntion at first that such a machine\ncould be built on time to make the\ncross-Atlantic flight in the good sea\nson this year.\n"Recognizing that fact Rodman\nWanamaker was willing to have\nthree machines constructed in suc\ncession, each to have the improve\nments suggested by the experiments\nwith the preceding. And so it was an\nimmense surprise to everybody to\nfind that the first machine was so ef\nficient that it seemed, and still seems,\npossible to use it for the flight, with\nout necessitating withdrawing the\nchanges in the construction of the\nmachine.\n"For the result so far was success\nful and there is no reason for believ\ning that the \'America\' will not suc\nceed to actually make the trans-At\nlantic flight, and immediately as pro\nposed." o o\nGIRL STEALS TO AID INVALID\nMOTHER ARRESTED\nNew York, July 8.
