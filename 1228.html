        <pre>['According to the most recent World Economic\nOutlook, the International Monetary Fund’s\ntwice-annual checkup on the state of the\nworld economy, the patient’s condition is good.\nBetween mid-2003 and mid-2004, global growth\naveraged 5 percent, well in excess of the 4 percent\nhistorical norm. The phenomenon is worldwide:\ngrowth has been respectable\nin the industrial\ncountries and exceptionally\nfast in emerging mar-\nkets. Asia, Latin America, central and eastern\nEurope, and even Africa have all shared in the\ntrend. The IMF’s forecast for 2005 is positive as well:\nglobal growth will again run in excess of 4 percent. \nNotwithstanding these impressive results, worries\npersist about the longer-term prognosis. Amer-\nica’s current account deficit (the excess of what the\ncountry is buying globally in goods and services\nover what it is selling) is approaching an unprecedented\n6 percent of gross domestic product. If for-\neigners suddenly grow unwilling to finance the\ncurrent account deficit by buying dollar reserves, the\nUS economy could end up in the soup. China, where\nthe government is using blunt administrative directives\nto rein in excessive bank lending, seems poised\nbetween an overheating economy and one that may\nsuffer a hard landing. If the world’s two principal\ngrowth engines begin to sputter, the outlook for\nglobal growth could suddenly look dire indeed. \nMost discussion of what should be done to\naddress these dangers focuses on exchange rates.\nSome say that the value of the dollar should come\ndown in order to narrow America’s unsustainable\ncurrent account deficit. Others disagree, arguing\nthat the deficit can be financed indefinitely, courtesy\nof Asian central banks’ insatiable appetite for\ndollar reserves.\nSome say Asia should abandon its strategy of\nundervaluation—sustained by foreign-exchange\nmarket interventions and massive accumulation of\ndollar reserves—and let its currencies float upward\nin order to share the pain of eliminating global\nimbalances. Again, others argue that it should not,\nsince doing so would mean losses on its reserves,\nhigher interest rates, and weaker demand in its\nprincipal export market, the United States.\nSome argue that Europe should restore fiscal discipline,\nand the European Central Bank cut inter-\nest rates, to prevent the appreciation of the euro\nfrom getting out of hand. Or maybe not: perhaps\nthe continent is better off having weaned itself from\nits fixation with fiscal balance and now that it has a\nEuropean Central Bank that is serious about price\nstability. If a strong euro is the price of this success,\nthen so be it. \nThis exchange-rate-centered debate has been\ninconclusive, even counterproductive, because it\nhas not focused on the fundamental problems, concentrating\ninstead on symptoms. The fundamental\nproblems are the policy mixes in the three regions.\nIn Asia (with the exception of Japan), monetary\npolicy is too loose while fiscal policy is too tight.\nThe region remains wedded to a strategy of exportand\ninvestment-led growth predicated on low\nexchange rates and low interest rates, and it is\nreluctant to contemplate larger budget deficits. \nIn the United States, the problem is that fiscal\npolicy is so loose—and projected to remain loose for\nso long—that the Federal Reserve will have to raise\ninterest rates too fast and too far if the dollar continues\nto fall. The result, an overly loose fiscal pol-\nicy and excessively tight monetary policy, is precisely\n“Constructive adjustments in the monetary and fiscal policy mix in Asia, the\nUnited States, and Europe would be an important step toward a healthier\nworld economy.”\n417\nOut-of-Step Policies\nThreaten Global Growth\nBARRY EICHENGREEN AND YUNG CHUL PARK\nBARRY EICHENGREEN, a Current History contributing editor, is\na professor of economics and political science at the University\nof California, Berkeley. YUNG CHUL PARK is an economics professor\nat Korea University.\nECONOMICS\nThe World, 2005\n', 'the opposite of what the economy needs if America’s\nproductivity miracle is to prove real and sustainable. \nIn Europe, the problem is that fiscal policy is too\nloose while monetary policy is already too tight.\nThe villains in this case are structural reform, which\nmakes for an interim period of slow growth and\nlimits the expansion of government revenues; political\npressure for social spending, which limits the\nscope for cutting expenditures; and a newly minted\ncentral bank playing a noncooperative game with\nnational fiscal authorities. \nASIA’S GROWTH STRATEGY\nEmerging Asia has been maintaining a mix of\nloose monetary policy and tight fiscal policy. Central\nbanks have been intervening in the foreign\nexchange market to prevent their currencies from\nrising against the dollar. Since Asian exchange rates\nare effectively pegged to the dollar, this means that\nAsian economies see their money and credit conditions\ndictated by the United States. So, for now, his-\ntorically low US interest rates send capital flows to\nAsia. As the dollars flow in, Asian central banks\nconvert them into\nlocal currency, holding\nthe dollars that\nthey thereby acquire\nas reserves.\nThe explanation\nfor Asian policy makers’\nattachment to their\ncurrency pegs is well known. They are part and parcel\nof the policies of export-led growth that have long\nbeen at the center of the region’s development strategy.\nKeeping real exchange rates low limited the\ngrowth of consumption, freeing up resources for capital\nformation. Capital controls ensured that the\nresulting savings were invested at home, while\ndomestic financial regulation ensured that the resulting\nresources were deployed in the traded-good sec-\ntor. Those traded-goods industries—first textiles and\nshipbuilding, later steel and autos, and most recently\nconsumer electronics—were the locus of learning by\ndoing. Concentrating on them allowed domestic\nfirms to boost productivity and move up the technology\nladder into the production of more sophisti-\ncated goods.\nIn pursuing this strategy China is following in\nthe footsteps of Hong Kong, Singapore, South\nKorea, and Taiwan, which themselves followed in\nthe footsteps of Japan. But the reality is that many\nof the preconditions allowing this strategy to work\nare no longer in place. The traded-goods sectors are\nno longer the sole source of learning effects and\npositive spillovers. Increasingly, the sources of\nspillovers are other activities, such as software\ndevelopment, back-office services, and finance. This\nmeans that investment needs to be broadened\nbeyond merchandise-exporting industries. Asian\ncountries will have to invest more in higher education\n(itself a service sector). They will have to invest\nmore in urban amenities in order to attract and\nretain knowledge workers.\nMoreover, as financial markets and institutions\nare deregulated, there is no longer a guarantee that\nthe high savings that are a corollary of undervalued\nreal exchange rates and slow real wage growth will\nbe channeled into productivity-enhancing investments.\nAs economies in the region approach tech-\nnological best practice, it will be harder for them to\nadvance through government policies that encourage\nfunds to flow to the same sectors developed by\nthe technological leaders when the latter were themselves\nstill engaged in catch-up and convergence.\nAnd, as the world continues to grow more complex,\nit will become harder still for governments to pick\nwinners. This is what financial markets are for,\nwhich is why financial\nliberalization is\nimportant. \nBut financial liberalization\nalso height-\nens the sensitivity of\neconomies to other\ndistortions, as became\napparent in Asia in the second half of the 1990s. If\nthe level of interest rates or the real exchange rate is\nwrong, a serious misallocation of resources can\nresult. For example, lax credit conditions can encourage\nthe flow of resources into construction and real\nestate speculation, heightening financial risks. There\nhas been ample recent evidence of this in Beijing,\nShanghai, and Seoul. In fact, this is a replay of the\nproblems that arose in Bangkok and elsewhere in the\nmid-1990s, the first time Asian countries sought to\npursue policies of export-led growth based on undervalued\nexchange rates in a significantly liberalized\nfinancial environment.\nDIMINISHING RETURNS\nAll these are reasons for thinking that Asia’s traditional\nmodel of export-led growth based on an\nundervalued exchange rate is encountering diminishing\nreturns. Asian policy makers remain reluc-\ntant to allow their exchange rates to rise and to\nthereby decouple monetary conditions from those\nin the rest of the world. But doing so would enable\nthem to better address the risk of financial bubbles\n418 • CURRENT HISTORY • December 2004\nIf foreigners suddenly grow unwilling to finance the\ncurrent account deficit by buying dollar reserves,\nthe US economy could end up in the soup.\n', 'in the real estate market and elsewhere. If this\nresulted in a better-balanced pattern of investment\nbetween merchandise-exporting industries and\nother sectors, it would not jeopardize learning\neffects, spillovers, and productivity growth. To the\ncontrary, there is reason to think it would make for\nhealthier and more sustainable growth.\nAsian policy makers worry that rising exchange\nrates would slow exports first and other forms of\ndemand would pick up only later, leading to recession\nor at least an undesirably sharp slowdown. This\nis where fiscal policy comes in. Deficit spending is\nthe obvious way to support demand in the period\nwhen a stronger exchange rate makes for slower\nexport growth but other sources of private demand\nhave not yet picked up. This is why Asian countries\nshould adopt a policy mix that would couple a\nlooser fiscal policy with tighter monetary policy.\nTo be sure, painting the region with such a broad\nbrush runs the risk of overlooking important nuance.\nThe argument for fiscal expansion to offset some\nmonetary tightening is strongest in the cases of South\nKorea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan. Indonesia\nand the Philippines, in contrast, suffer from major\ninefficiencies on both the tax and spending sides of\nthe budget and have serious debt problems; there is\nreason to worry that fiscal expansion there would\nneither enhance confidence nor stabilize demand.\nJapan is a special case, where what is needed is much\nlooser monetary policy to finally banish deflation—\nand where recommendations for looser fiscal policy\nare problematic because of inherited debts and the\nrapid aging of the country’s population.\nChina’s rapid growth, in combination with the\nvery high imported-input content of exports, suggests\nthat no fiscal adjustment is needed to offset a\ntighter monetary policy. This is fortunate insofar as\nany fiscal stimulus in China would likely take the\nform of increased spending by provincial governments\nand state-owned enterprises, which are not\nparticularly efficient in their use of resources.\nDoes adjusting the policy mix toward tighter\nmonetary and looser fiscal policy mean that Asian\ncountries should allow their currencies to float\nfreely? No. Only in relatively large, relatively closed\neconomies like the United States and euro-zone\nstates can the exchange rate be treated with benign\nneglect even for limited periods. If currency appreciation\nbegins getting out of hand, central banks\nshould use all of the monetary instruments at their\ndisposal to prevent it from continuing.\nWould adjusting the Asian policy mix also solve\nthe problem of global imbalances? Not by itself. A\ntighter monetary policy that induces exchange rate\nappreciation would slow export growth, while a tax\ncut would stimulate the demand for imported\ngoods. But the effects on the US current account\ndeficit are unlikely to be large. The current accounts\nof Asian countries are not going to shift from surplus\nto deficit overnight. \nFinally, it is important to emphasize that this\nshift in the policy mix offers no panacea. It would\nnot solve all of Asia’s problems. It is not a substitute\nfor progress in strengthening domestic financial\nmarkets, downsizing state sectors, and limiting government\ninterference in the allocation of resources. \nPROFLIGATE AMERICA\nIn the United States, what is needed is not a\nchange in the policy mix but an adjustment in fiscal\npolicy to prevent an undesirable policy mix in the\nfuture. The dominant fact about the US macroeconomic\nmix is that fiscal and monetary policies both\nremain very loose. In 2001, as economic activity\nslowed, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate\n11 times, from 6.5 percent to 1.75 percent. It then\nbrought the funds rate down still further, to 1.25 percent\nin November 2002. There is no precedent for\npolicy rates this low, at least since the 1930s.\nCumulatively, these reductions in the funds rate\nsubjected the economy to a tremendous amount of\nmonetary stimulus. Meanwhile, Congress and the\nadministration adopted significant tax cuts starting\nin early 2001. Marginal tax rates were reduced, and\nconsumers were provided rebate checks anticipating\ntheir savings. There was to be a phased reduction in\nestate taxes. Further tax policy initiatives in March\n2002 allowed many corporate investments to be\nexpensed through the third quarter of 2004, frontloading\ninvestment. Although the economy was\nalready recovering, in early 2003 President George\nW. Bush proposed further tax reductions. Some\ninvolved accelerating cuts agreed to in 2001 but\nwhich had then been planned to go into effect only\ngradually, while others were designed to make permanent\nreductions initially foreseen as temporary\nresponses to the 2001 recession. The 2003 package\nalso included a significant reduction in tax rates on\ndividends and capital gains.\nThe magnitude of the resulting fiscal stimulus is\napparent in the shift of the federal budget balance\n(including the social security surplus) from a surplus\nof 2.5 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2000 to a\ndeficit of more than 4 percent of GDP in fiscal year\n2004. The IMF ascribes about half of the change\nthrough fiscal year 2003 to the 2001 recession and\nthe relatively weak recovery that followed. A quarter\nis attributable to increased discretionary spend-\nOut-of-Step Policies Threaten Global Growth • 419\n', 'ing on defense, homeland security, and social programs.\nThe remaining quarter is attributed to the\neffects of the tax cuts. And the share attributable to\nthe tax cuts rises going forward.\nClearly, some temporary loosening of fiscal policy\nwas desirable when the economy was weak. But,\nwhile the effects of the recession will now go away\n(hopefully), the increased costs of defense and\nhomeland security will not. The tax relief acts are\nprojected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)\nto add more than $1 trillion to the federal government\ndebt, accounting for perhaps half of the $2\ntrillion cumulative increase until the budget supposedly\nreturns to balance early in the next decade. \nUnder current law, many of these tax cuts phase\nout by 2011, allowing the budget to return to balance\nat that time assuming healthy growth of the economy\nin the interim. However, the administration’s current\nintention is make the tax cuts permanent, which\nwould increase the annual budget deficit by a further\n$1.7 trillion (averaging 2.5 percent of GDP) through\n2013. The largest effects\nwould be felt after 2010,\nsince that is when the\nphase-out would have\notherwise been complete.\nBased on the fis-\ncal year 2004 budget,\nthe CBO projects deficits\nof 2 percent of GDP (including the social security surplus),\nand deficits of 3.5 percent to 4 percent of GDP\nwhen that surplus is excluded, through 2008 (and\nonly slightly smaller deficit ratios in 2009 and 2010).\nThis implies that the US government’s net general\ndebt may rise from its current level of 50 percent of\nGDP to 65 percent or more early in the coming\ndecade. If discretionary spending proves difficult to\ncontrol, federal budget deficits will be larger still.\nAnd if the tax cuts are made permanent, the deficit\ncould rise to 5 percent of GDP by the middle of the\nnext decade. At that point the debt will begin to\nexpand explosively. \nThis additional debt will put upward pressure on\nUS and global interest rates. As the US debt burden\nrises, investors will require a growing premium in\norder to hold additional Treasury securities. One way\nthis risk premium can emerge is if foreigners grow\nreluctant to absorb additional US Treasury securities\nas their supply continues to expand. This will place\ndownward pressure on the dollar, and foreign\ninvestors (and at some point, presumably, US\ninvestors as well) will require compensation for the\nfall in the purchasing power of US Treasury securities. \nSome have forecast that the federal government\nwill be able to continue placing some 40 percent of\nits additional debt issuance with foreigners. They\nassume that the countries of Asia and Latin America\nhave insatiable appetites for international\nreserves—reserves that can be most conveniently\naccumulated and held in the form of dollars. Committed\nas they are to export-led growth, these coun-\ntries will continue to intervene in the foreign\nexchange market to keep their currencies from rising\nagainst the dollar. In turn, this will work to keep\nUS Treasury yields down.\nA TIGHTENING TO COME?\nThe question is whether this forecast is accurate.\nIt assumes that Asian countries, which account for\nthe bulk of the reserve accumulation, will not move\naway from policies of export-led growth and undervalued\nexchange rates. And yet, as we have argued,\nthere are good reasons for thinking they will do so\nsooner rather than later. If they do, the dollar will\nweaken and US interest\nrates will have to rise.\nForeign central banks\nnow hold $1.5 trillion\nof US Treasury securities\n(roughly 40 per-\ncent of outstanding\nissues). Official foreign\nholders, mostly central banks, account for 60 percent\nof that $1.5 trillion. If they curtail their demands and\nsell off some of their existing holdings, the downward\npressure on the dollar could be intense.\nThe dollar’s decline will give the Fed more reason\nto raise interest rates. That there has been no\nnoticeable acceleration of inflation to date, despite\nthe dollar’s almost 15 percent decline on a tradeweighted\nbasis from its early-decade peak, does not\nmean that future inflationary trends will be equally\naccommodating. The dollar’s past decline occurred\nagainst a backdrop of falling consumer prices. US\nlabor markets have been unusually slack, given the\nslow pace of job creation, something that (hopefully)\nwill not continue indefinitely. If the dollar\ndeclines further, the Fed will raise rates.\nThis combination of loose fiscal policy and tight\nmonetary policy is not what the US economy needs\nin a period when productivity is surging as a result\nof the private sector’s success at applying advances\nrelated to the information technology (IT) revolution.\nThere is a growing body of evidence that pro-\nductivity growth in advanced industrial countries\nis associated with IT use rather than IT production.\n420 • CURRENT HISTORY • December 2004\nAsia’s traditional model of export-led\ngrowth based on an undervalued exchange\nrate is encountering diminishing returns.\n', 'Installation of IT and the reorganization of production\nto capitalize on its availability require invest-\nment, and a mix of loose fiscal and tight monetary\npolicy is the inverse of the standard prescription for\nan investment-friendly environment. \nThe longer-term structural challenges facing the\nUS economy also militate in favor of a tighter fiscal\npolicy complemented by a looser than otherwise\nmonetary stance. The CBO projects that the annual\ngrowth of Social Security spending will rise from\n4.6 percent in 2004 to 6.3 percent by 2014, while\nMedicare and Medicaid spending will rise at a rate\nof 8 percent to 9 percent per year. The net present\nvalue of the unfunded actuarial liabilities of the\nSocial Security and Medicare systems is more than\n150 percent of GDP when measured over a 75-year\nhorizon. Filling this gap will require transfers from\nthe federal government’s general revenues and lead\nto an explosive rise in government debt centered on\nthe second quarter of the century, assuming no corrective\naction. This is an argument for not delaying\nfurther in addressing these problems. \nThus, for at least three reasons—the impact on\nUS interest rates and therefore productivity growth,\nthe longer-run challenges facing US public health\nand retirement systems, and the implications for the\nrest of a world dependent on a strong US economy—it\nwould be beneficial for America to start\nadjusting its policy mix now. \nEUROPE’S LOOMING CRISIS\nIn Europe, the problem is also that fiscal policy is\ntoo loose, but here this is already showing up in a\nmonetary policy that is too tight. Europe’s Stability\nPact, the procedure added to the Maastricht Treaty\nin 1997 to prevent members of the monetary union\nfrom running excessive deficits, has essentially broken\ndown. The budget deficits of large countries\ncontinue to exceed prescribed limits, and efforts by\nthe European Commission and the small countries\nto impose collective discipline have been rebuffed.\nThe European Central Bank’s reluctance to cut interest\nrates at anything approaching the speed of the US\nFederal Reserve—even in the face of continued slow\ngrowth—reflects worries about the future inflationary\nconsequences of these fiscal policies.\nClearly, Europe would be better off with a tighter\nfiscal policy and looser monetary policy. The continent\nhas a looming demographic crisis: birth rates\nare lower than in the United States, and the female\nreproduction rate is well below that required to\nmaintain a population without immigration. And\nEurope is much less able than the United States to\nassimilate working-age immigrants. Whereas the\npopulation of the United States is expected to rise\nfrom 285 million in 2000 to 400 million by 2050,\nthe European Union’s population is expected to fall\nfrom 377 million to 339 million. A rise in US immigration\nfrom 1.2 million to 2.4 million annually, a\nsignificant but not inconceivable increase, would be\nenough to keep ratios of elderly dependents to\nworkers from rising. In Europe, by contrast, there\nis no way that a sharp increase in old-age dependency\nratios will be avoided absent a sea change in\nattitudes toward immigration. \nThe implications for pension and health care\nobligations are staggering. This is a prospect for\nwhich governments ought to be saving now. To be\nsure, reductions in deficit spending (increases in\ngovernment saving) may be contractionary on\nimpact. But this effect can be offset by some relaxation\nof monetary policy.\nThis shift in the policy mix would also be good\nfor the growth of the European economy. For some\nyears Europe has lagged behind the United States\nand Asia in terms of aggregate growth. In particular,\nit has been less successful than the United States\nat exploiting growth opportunities afforded by the\nnew generation of information technologies. In part\nthis reflects the absence of an investment surge\ncomparable to what has occurred in America, and\nhence a slower rate of adoption of new information\nand communications technologies. A tighter fiscal\nand looser monetary policy, by lowering interest\nrates, would encourage additional investment. It\nwould also bring down the foreign exchange value\nof the euro, relieving pressure on the continent’s\nmanufacturing sector.\nREVISING THE STABILITY PACT\nHow can this change in the policy mix be\nachieved? The answer is a reform of the Stability\nPact that enhances the credibility of its surveillance\nand sanctions. Specifically, that reform should shift\nthe focus from arbitrary numerical thresholds for\nbudget deficits to the structural characteristics of\neconomies that determine the appropriate stance\nfor fiscal policy. Recent reforms proposed by the\nEuropean Commission are a step in the right direction.\nThese would allow member states that stick to\na medium-term objective of balancing their structural\nbudgets—meaning their budgets adjusted for\nthe effect of the business cycle—to run larger\ndeficits in recessions. Countries with low state pension\nliabilities and low public debts would also be\ncut additional slack at the commission’s discretion. \nOut-of-Step Policies Threaten Global Growth • 421\n', 'But these modest reforms do not go far enough.\nThe rationale for the Stability Pact is that deficits\ntoday may imply deficits tomorrow, and that\nchronic deficits are problematic because they may\nlead to problems of debt sustainability that force the\ncentral bank to provide an inflationary debt bailout.\nBut not all deficits are equally chronic. Transitory\ndeficits in recessions are part of the solution, not\npart of the problem; they simply reflect the operation\nof automatic fiscal stabilizers. On the other\nhand, deficits are likely to prove chronic where\ncountries have fiscal institutions that are conducive\nto free riding and common pool problems, when\nthey allow special interest groups to lobby for\nspending on their preferred programs without taking\ninto account the consequences for the overall\nbudget, and where political distortions are allowed\nto dominate the budget-making process. \nThe implication is that the Stability Pact should\nfocus not merely on fiscal numbers, which are arbitrary\nand easily cooked, but on fiscal institutions.\nThe EU should agree to base exemptions from the\nStability Pact’s ceilings on an explicit index of institutional\nreform and create an independent com-\nmittee to design and implement that index. The\nindex might give countries a point each for, say,\nreform of their budgetary processes, reform of their\npension schemes, and reform of their labor markets\nand unemployment insurance systems. Countries\nreceiving three points would then be exempt from\nthe Stability Pact’s guidelines, since there is no reason\nto expect that they will be prone to chronic\ndeficits. The others would still be subject to the\npact’s warnings, sanctions, and fines. \nBecause the Stability Pact will then have a clear\nand coherent rationale, its penalties will be more\ncredible and enforceable. There will be more fiscal\nconsolidation where it is needed most. And this will\nopen up room for the European Central Bank to\nrelax monetary conditions, bringing its war of attrition\nwith the continent’s fiscal authorities to an end.\nIn turn this will help to create a more investmentfriendly\npolicy mix and relieve the upward pressure\non the euro that is hurting the continent’s manufacturing\nindustry.\nAs with Asia, it is important to emphasize that\nsimply changing the policy mix will not solve all of\nEurope’s problems. The continent still needs more\nflexible labor markets, easier firm entry and exit,\nmore competitive product markets, and more efficient\ndelivery of higher education. A tighter fiscal\npolicy and looser monetary policy will not solve\nthese problems by themselves. Nor will a more\ncompetitive exchange rate. But, by making for a\nmore investment-friendly macroeconomic environment,\nthey can only help.\nFINDING THE RIGHT MIX\nWhile exchange rate fluctuations sometimes take\non a life of their own, more commonly they are\nsymptoms rather than causes of underlying problems.\nIn the United States, Europe, and Asia alike,\nthe relevant fundamentals can be described in terms\nof the policy mix. In Asia the long-standing strategy\nof export-led growth continues to dictate a loose\nmonetary policy intended to keep exchange rates\nlow, accompanied by a tight fiscal policy needed to\nprevent economies and financial sectors from overheating.\nGiven that this strategy of export-led growth\nhas reached a point of diminishing returns, Asian\ncountries would be better served by adjusting the\nmix in the direction of a tighter monetary policy and\nlooser fiscal policy. This would facilitate efforts to\ninvest in the higher education and urban amenities\nneeded to cultivate and retain knowledge workers. \nIn the United States, fiscal policy is loose and\npromises to remain that way indefinitely. If foreign\ninvestors’ appetite for US Treasury securities begins\nto wane, the dollar’s depreciation could accelerate,\nforcing the Fed to tighten significantly. This\nprospective mix of loose fiscal policy and tight\nmonetary policy is the opposite of what is needed\nat a time when the public sector is absorbing\nfinance better devoted to productivity-enhancing\nprivate investments. \nThese shifts in the policy mix in the United\nStates and Asia in turn would relieve some of the\nupward pressure on the euro. Europe could then\nshift its own policy mix toward a tighter fiscal policy\nand looser monetary policy. Many of the same\narguments about why the United States would benefit\nfrom a tighter fiscal policy apply in Europe as\nwell, as do the demographic arguments, but even\nmore forcefully. A tighter fiscal policy would\nencourage a relaxation of monetary policy, which\nwould give a further boost to investment and manufacturing\ncompetitiveness.\nMonetary and fiscal policies are not the only\nvariables that drive exchange rates, much less the\nperformance of economies. But neither are these\npolicies irrelevant. Constructive adjustments in the\nmonetary and fiscal policy mix in Asia, the United\nStates, and Europe would be an important step\ntoward a healthier world economy. ■\n422 • CURRENT HISTORY • December 2004\n']</pre>
