The teach\ners came early to the call of Mr. Jen\nsen for the purpose of holding a three\ndays\' session before the opening of\nschool next Monday. With the very\nrapid growth of the Elko school and\nwith the coming of the new buildings *\nthere are many questions of first itn- |\nportance to be settled and adopted\nby the school. It seemed deslrablt*\nfrom every standpoint that the pro !\ngram of the school should be the pro- j\ngram of the entire faculty and not!\nmerely the ideas of one person. The\nteachers are highly enthusiastic over\ntheir work; it lends to the growth of\nthat enthusiasm if they can feel that\n(their Ideas will have effect. A group\nof specialists working together can\naccomplish almost the impossible if\nthey pull in the same direction. That\ncan only be done by exchanging ideas,\ndeveloping a collective program, and\ngetting into sympathy with other de\npartments besides their own. The\nteachers fully feel that they serve the\nentire school And the entire com\nmunity and not merely their partic\nular departments.\nThese are probably the first meet\nings of their kind that have ever been\nheld in Nevada; it is doubtful if any\nIt II V ft klti ?% 4\n? ??** ??\' ?? ??*??* *?u 1*1*- rnimc\nFollowing are some of the questions\nthat are being carefully considered \'\nand regarding which a definite pro\ngram is being adopted:\nSupervised Study: The faculty is \'\ndetermining that the assumption that \'\nyoungsters know how to study is \'\nwrong; and that it is the duty of the\nteachers to teach the students how to ?\nstudy. As a resuP \'he classes will \'\nprobably run for seventy-five minutes \'\neach day instead of the usual forty- \'\nfive.

Probably\nj an hour or more will be set aside dur\nj ing the school day (not at the end of;\nthe day) for the complete organization\nand development of this activity. The\nI school will offer some two or three\nj dozen different student activities so\nthat the students may select some\nactivity which they like.\nnoslde those there are many other\n\'questions which have not yet been\nopened hut which will be definitely\nsettled before the faculty adjourns\nSaturday evening.\nFollowing is a complete list of the\nmembers of the faculty of Hie high\nschool for this year:\nH.

H. Avey)\nThe American people have to a cer\ntain extent thought very lightly of\nwhet this war really means I > us. I\nMost of the people as a rule have look\ned 10 their wealthier neighbors to uj\nthe necessary. It has been a case of\n"let l ome one else do It," or I liuVt n\'t .\ntime to worry over something that ;\ndoesn\'t concern me.\nThe eastern tf-fople have thought\nfar more seriously of what must be\ndone to make this war a success, than\nthose living in the west. It has not\nbeen a case of just think with them\nit has been a case of "do something.\'\nThey have all accepted certain work\nto do. They have alloted a portion o.\ntheir earnings to give to the Red Cross\nor some equally important phase that ,\nmust be supported.\nThe larger eastern cities all went i\ninto the work of securing recruits for\nthe army or navy with a great amount\nof thenthuBiasm. Prizes were offered\nholidays were proclaimed for this\nwork by the mayors, so that this\nwork could be carried on more effec\ntively.\nI had the opportunity of visiting all\nof the large eastern cities and talked j\nwith many of the officials in each city, j\nEach one of these were extremely ;\npleased with co-operation that the!\npeople were giving them. If you will\nlook over the records you will find\nthat most all the eastern cities over\nsubscribed their liberty bond issue.\nThe real reason for this was on ac\ncount of the large manufacturing con\ncerns buying very large blocks of\nthose bonds, paying cash for same,\nand selling them to their employes\non such a basis that hardly any could\nrefuse buying t? certain number. Be\nsides this, they told each and every\none of their men that at any time that\nthey needed any money that they\ncould turn in their bonds for cash.\nThis protected the employe so that\nhe could buy Ills bonds and get his\nmoney back at any time. This did\naway with the idea that most people j\nhad that after buying their bonds\nthat they would have to wait until j\nthese became due before they eould j\nget their money. In Cleveland alone\nthe manufacturing concerns purchosed !\neight million dollars worth of bonds. !\nI would guess that the eastern factor- ?\nies alone bought five hundred million\ndollars worth of bonds and sold them |\nto their employes on this plan. The\nwestern cities of course have not the j\nlarge manufacturing concerns like tin. |\neast to look to for this help.\nThe reports front the different court\nhouses east of Chicago, show that\nfewer men are claiming exemption\nthan the coast cities. I do not knov [\nwhether this is due to our western |\nmen really having more dependents j\non them for support or not. I do\nknow, however, that the young men |\nin the east are far more enthusiastic\nabout going to the front than those 1 j\nhave talked to since coming west. I j\nbelieve all the people in the United\nStates are looking at the seriousness \'\nof what this war really means to them j\nin a different point of view than they !\ndid a month or two ago.\n?? . ??\n? ?\n? SHOOTING AFFAIR ?\n? AT JARBIDGE ?\n? ?\n? Sheriff Harris received a ?\ntelephone meusnge from Jar- ?\n? bidge this morning /notifying ?\n? him that a shooting scrape had ?\noccured at that place. ?\n? According to the account giv- ?\nen over the phone, a man by ? ;\n? the name of William Cullen ?!\nwaylaid and shot with a shot- ?\n? gun a man by the name of ?1\n? Charles Ross.
