This dream of the muddle-headed middle-class mind is only a manifesta\ntion of middle-class decay and hastening death through self-inflicted gangrene. Let us have none of\nthese dreams.

The\ntwo-pound fish swallowed the one; the four\n! pound fish swallowed the two; the eight-pound\nfish swallowed the four; the sixteen-pound fish\nswallowed the eight, and lay alone at peace and\nwaxed fat.\nBut alas for the lone lord of the watery king\ndom ! An angler appeared, spied a future feast,\ncaught him, carried him home and divided him\nup for the whole family.\nHOW TO KILL THE SOCIALIST PARTY.\nDevise a scheme by which little fish have equal opporturitv to eat big ones.\nDevise a scheme by which little capitalists have an equal chance with big ones.\nBUT SUCH SCHEMES CANNOT BE AND THE ONLY MORAL TO BE DRAWN FROM FABLES\nFOR FISH AND FINANCIERS IS THAT OF THE COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP AND DEMOCRATIC\nMANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL INDUSTRY AND THAT MEANS SOCIALISM\nFOR SOCIALIST NKWS AND PROPAGANDA\nKVKKKTT.

SHEPARDSON,\nS Secretary, Local Bellingham North\nMotion for state referendum:\n\'• Local Everett 6th Ward moves to\n! amend the state constitution by strik\nj ing out that portion of section 71 per\ntaining to the compulsory assessment\nj of special expense stamps for the pur\npose of creating a fund to pay state\nI committeemen $2 per day while at\ntending the state convention,\ni Comment —Two dollars per day for\nconvention attendance would aggre\ngate from $1,500 to $1,800, a sum that\ncould not be raised even if practical\n! ly every member paid the assessment\n■A compulsory assessment would dis\nastrously reduce the membership in\ngood standing. A subsidized attend\nance means an increased attendance\nand therefore increased expenses for\nrailroad fares. .\nIf the convention fund proves in\nsufficient to pay the fares, a drain\nwould have to be made on funds that\nshould be used for organization and\neducation. While believing in the\nprinciples of this section it is hardly\nj practical under the present ratio of\n! convention representation.\nFor Local Everett sth Ward,\n: B. S. CROSBY,\nCHRIS .T.

The executive committee suspended them,\nand now the state committee by a vote of over three to one has ex\npelled them. ,T/»n c\nMay we address ■ few words to those who voted NO on reier\nendura six? The building of the socialist party may be compared to\nthe building of a house with poorly selected material. When at cer\ntain points in the construction, timbers are found to be unequal to\nthe strain they are forced to bear, they must be cast aside.\nTo cast bad material aside requires three things—courage, hon\nesty of purpose and knowledge of construction. The Commonwealth\nprefers to believe that those who voted "NO," on referendum six,\nare lacking in knowledge of construction only.\nThe socialist party must strenghten its foundation and its dim\nension timbers by more education and better organization. It never\nhas and never will lack materially in courage and honesty of purpose.\nFor its slow growth through the negative force of inertia and the posi\ntive force of persecution, leaves few within its ranks who are not con\nsecrated heart and soul to the emancipation of the workers and pro\nducers of the world.\nSUPPORT SOCIALIST DAILIES.\nTwo of the five "English" socialist dalies have suspended publi\ncation since election*. .\nThe "Chicago World" was forced under by a too rapid growth\nwith it sdemand for a quick increase of equipment and capital.\nThe "Black Hills Register" was forced to temporarily surrender\nafter a two-years\' gallant fight, i nan isolated region, against corrupt\nand strongly organized capital.\nBut something else is to blame as well.\nThere are a million socialists in the nation.\nThey could support a daily in every state.\nThey have not yet learned to do so.\nThey are still wasting their money on the "Kept Press" of their\nmasters.\n1 Support the New York Call.\nSupport the Milwaukee Leader.\nSupport the Belleville, 111., Alarm.\nThey are your own. They need you. AND YOU NEED THEM.\nDECEMBER SCHOOL ELECTION.\nThe December school elections are over.\nThey have once more proved the necessity of education.\nThe* workers are still indifferent to the mental poisons fed their\nchildren by the masters of bread.\nEverett received 20 per cent of the vote.\nAberdeen received 20 per cent as well.\nSeattle was handicapped again by party treason. Richard Win\nsor, defeated candidate for governor, in our party referendum, put\na signed article in the Seattle Times advising socialists to vote for a\ncapitalist in preference to Comrade Nicholas Schmitt, the regular so\ncialist nominee.\nTacoma carried on a strong campaign and will be stronger next\nDecember. . . ■\nNo scientific socialist is ever discouraged and his strength is in\ncreased with each violent contact with mother earth.\nThe March school elections in the smaller places are going to\ngive a good object lesson in real results to the larger industrial cen\nters.\nBegin preparation for 1913 school campaigns NOW!\nNOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN.\nSeveral socialist papers have recently started discussion of what\nis called "Cliptomania." The National Socialist is real excited about\nit. The New York Call treats it as a joke.\nAnd now the Commonwealth approves it among socialist papers.\n"There is nothing new under the sun" applies to many things.\nHere is an illustration:\nLast summer the editor of the Commonwealth was wasting his\ntime in reading a book called "My Soldier Lady." He read a revival\nstory on a southern revivalist. He rewrote it, borrowing a simple\nidea, into the following:\n"He was a successful revivalist and he approached a poorly clad\nworker near the \'mourners\' bench.\'\n"\'Are you working for Christ, my brother?\' asked the Lord\'s\nservant.\n"\'I am working for John Ilobbs at $2 per day.

In this state\nment Derger predicted the dissolution\nof tin- republican party, a split in the\ndemocratic party la the near future,\nthe rise of the progressives, and a\ncomplete realignment of the capital\nist political Jarties. The following i.\nthe statement:\nMr. Berger said: "As everybod>\nknows, I was defeated by a combina\nion of the republicans and democrats\nin Milwaukee county. Mr. Stafford\nthe gentleman who beat me, was el\nected on a so-called nonpartisan demo\ncratic fusion, although while he wai\nin the house, he was known as ;\n\'stand-patter,\' Politics makes strang<\nbedfellows, and I readily understam\nthat socialists cannot claim any dls\ntrict until they have an absolute ma\n: jority of all the votes there. A Bimpli\nplurality will not do for us, becausi\nthe two old parties are sure to forge\ntheir little differences and join hand;\n\' as soon as they find that the workini\n; class wants to give expression to it:\nInterobts on the political field.\n"I am it) for the cake of tin\nt working class and the country. Th<\n| socialist party has gained over a huu\nilli\'<l per (rut In votes \'11111 hi; th\nliihl four years, lint II will not bo rep\nperented in the next congress. I\nthould undoubtedly i" for the benefl\nof the country and nil Classes If tin\nIdea that has taken such i Rtroni\nhold upon the diuni of every civl\n11/.od people would hare •ohm repre\nttlvei In congress.\n"The presence of Gfi soelulists li\ncoiißrrss would even have a wonder\nfill in. 11 upon the only parties. I\'\nwould compel! thorn to accomplish\nlegislation of which tin do not ever\ndream today.\n"As for the general effect of the\nlast eleootlon, tho American people\nundoubtedly have repudiated the re\npublican party; they have lack of con\nfldenco In the democratic party.\n"Mr Wilson, the democratic candl\ndate, had the support of the republican\nstalwarts and of the stand-patters It\nalmost every state In the union, be\ncause that element realized that Mr,\nTaft could not bo re-elected. Mr. Wil\n•on had the solid south, where in the\nmain, they only register the votes of\nadherents of the democratic party.\nAnd with all those advantages, Mr.\nWilson polled nearly a million votes\nless on November 5, when he was\nelected president of the United states,\nthan did Mr. Bryan on the democratic\nticket when ho was defeated.\n"In other words, the republican par\nty was smashed, but the democratic\nparty was practically repudiated.\n"The democratic party, of course,\nwill have all the federal offices for\nfour years and, therefore, is jubilant.\nBut the democratic party will also\nhave all the responsibilities and\ntroubles during the next four years\nthat the republican party had in the\nlast four and they have less Insight\nin economic conditions even than have\nthe republican leaders.\n"The republicans were defeated be\ncause they were conservative: the\ndemocrats will get theirs because\nthey are reactionary. And the poor\ndemocratic party cannot help being\nreactionary. It is controlled by a\ncoalition of the south and Tammany.\n"The south is almost 30 years be\nhind the north —Is behind England,\nGermany and France —in its develop\nment. The south is just entering upon\nthat riot of capitalist domination\nthrough which the north has passed\nduring the last 30 years.\n"The south is just waking up. Its\ncapitalist investors will naturally\nclaim protection for their \'infant in\ndustries.\' Now how Is the demo\ncratic party to make good on its plat\nform pledges" in regard to the tariff?\nI shall say nothing about Tammany as\na factor in national politics. Tam\nmany\'s deeds will speak loud enough.\n"The democratic party will also\nhave a hard position on account of\nthe high cost of living. A dollar to\n[lay buys about as much of the neces\nsities of life as 60 did about 13 years\nago. The democratic party cannot\nchange that. But for that very rea\nson there will be a political revolu\ntion four years hence.\n"Last, but not least, the demo\ncrats promised to solve the trust\nquestion by smashing the trusts. This\ncannot be done of course. But how\nire the democrats going to explain\ntheir failure. Moreover, an Industri\nal crisis — with \'democratic hard\ntimes\' and soup kitchens — due in a\nyear or two. This time the panic\nwill also strike the south which is\nbeginning to manufacture. The sons\nand daughters of the men who fought\nat Gettysburg will clamor for bread\nand justice, and the solid south will\nbreak up.\n"As for the "Bull Moose" party, I\ndiffer from opinion that it will die be\ncause Roosevelt was not elected.\nRoosevelt Is not the progressive\nmovement, which has a well-defined\neconomic basis in our country. A\nrealignment of the old political par\nties is absolutely needed and has to\ncome.\n, "There is really no difference be\ntween the democratic and republican\nparties as the parties stand now in\ncongress and in the various state\nlegislatures. The support of Taft\njtand-patters helped elect Wilson.\nBut there is deep cleavage vlithiu the\ndemocratic party as well. Last fall\nthe pie counter formed the bridge\nconnecting the factions of the demo\ntrots. But the days of pie-count.i\nloltlci are passing. A political part)\ni at.! be the expression of economic\ninterests if it is to survive. The*\nintjrebts now center about classes oi\ngrqips within the classes.\n♦There are now the great class\nquctions that must be solved —th<\nquit ion of capital and labor foremos\nof tH —then the questions of .urit;\nin cM age and sickness and so on. Tin\ndenocratlc party hardly knows tin\nsoul of the»e terms, let alone beini\nabU to solve such questions. Th<\nproiressives, taking up some of thes\nthir ;s, will gain strength—but the;\nare lound to fall because no other pc\nlitlcfl organization than the social!*\nparty the party of the working clasi\nrc-allf can solve social problems.\n"However. I will say that if It ha\nnot leen for Mr. Roosevelt and bi\nsernifoeialist platform, the socialist\nwoulj have undoubtedly polled tw\nmillifi votes \'.his time. Our grea\nparty? will poll at least two millio\nvoterfnext time .\'. the factional an\nnunrchlHtlo spirit ill li" kept Oil)\n"As for my own person, I will pa;\nHint 1 bar* Hind my work in t>>•\nMoom of Ucprpßpntntivos and shal\n• rijoy it to the last moment for m;\nciliißß ..nil for tha new world.
