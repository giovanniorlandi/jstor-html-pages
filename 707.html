Caldwell.\nThe School Bonds.\nThe Banner is requested by some of\nthe school officials of this district to\nsay in-regard to the school tax election\nto occur on the 17th tliut the proposed\ntax is merely voting the same tax that\nwas previously voted, only for a longer\nand more definite term of yours. The\nformer authority voted by the i »copie\nfor a tax of IP mills, to lie need iu the\nerection of a new school house at Plain\nDealing, was found to l>e unsatisfac\ntory to tile bond buyers liecause it\nfailed to name a definite nnmlier of\nyears during which the tax should lie\nlevied : and also liecause the advance\nIn the prices of la I sir and material\nhad made the proposed building more\ncostly. The election on the 17tli Is to\ncorrect the matters and not to vote a\nnew tax. The time of the levy is ex\ntended from an indefinite iieriod to\ntwenty years and the tax will lie dis\ncontinued as soon as the building is\npaid for.\nThe tax, Mr. N. W. Sen tell says,\nwill yield alwiut $10.250 each year,\nwhich should clear off the indebtedness\nand cause the tax to lie discontinued in\nless time than twenty years.\nIt is further urged uirui tjie voters\nthat the present school building is too\nsmall to accommodate the nÿjplter of\nimpils comfortably, and the humlier of\nchildren iu attendance is Increasing\neach year. The building is also un\nsanitary and not caimhle of lieing prop\nerly heated. It is furthermore said to\nlie dangerous.\nMr. J, E. Walker, secretary of the\nlocal school lMiitrd. agrees with Parish\nSuiierintendent Fortson that work on\nthe new hnihling can lie begun as soon\nas tlie people vote the tax. That is.\ntoward the end of February. Some\n$10.IMNi .already on hand is available\nfor tlie lieginning of the work rfml more\nmoney can lie realize«! later from tlie\nsale of the iMiuds to tiuish the build\ning.
