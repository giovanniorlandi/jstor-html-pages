But since the war started he and\nhis director rave never accepted a\n. story for production which has not\nyet been relieved by almost as ninth\ncomedy as drama. That Is a policy\nwhich is a double effect. It height\nens the effect of each. "A Woman\'s\nFool" Is a frankly dramatic subject,\nbut the comedy relief Is so cleverly\nInterjected that you can call It a dra\nma or a comedy, whichever you pre\nfer.

GALBREATH\nSHERIFF OF MASON COUNTY\nFARMERS IN THIS\nSECTION BEGIN\nTOBACCO HOUSING\nCrop In Mason and Adjoluing Counties\nIs Xow Being Cut and Will Soon\nGo Into, the Burns Farmers\nPleased With Production.\nThe farmers of Mason and adjoin\ning counties are now in the midst of\nhousing the tobacoo crop. Work of\ncutting In some sections began last\nweek and the farmers will be at the\nbig job of the year all over the dis\ntrict during this week.\nThe weed had ripened well and the\ncool weather of the past few days has\nbepn fine on those who have been cut\nting and housing. Although it may\nbe a little uncomfortable for the peo\nple. It is the best sort of weather for\ncutting if it does not get too cool\nand the frost docs not nip the weed\ncut in the patch.\nThe job of hmuing the tobacco crop\nIs to be the biggest job of the year\nf(ir the farmer. It Is during this per\niod that the need of labor is going to\nbe Telt. They have been able to get\ntheir crops worked very well during\nthe summer months but the big job\nwill be to get it in the barn for this\ntakes much work and requires many\nman.\nThe city men would be only too\nglad to lend a hand for a few days but\nvery few city men\' are able to cjit to\nbacco having had little experience in\nthis task which requires some knowl\nedge of farming. However, the city\nmen may be able to lend a hand in\ngetting the crop into the barm and In\nhanging it.\nAll of the farmers in this sedtlon\nwho have been asked about the tobac\nco crop seem very well pleased with\nthe way the crop has turned out.\nThere will be more tobacco In this\nand adjoining counties than had been\nexpected and It will be of a very good\nquality. All figures of supply and de\nmand seem tofndicate that the price\nthis season will be higher than ever\nbefore and the farmers are feeling\nwell over the prospects and will be\nvery liberal In their support of the\nnew government loan to be opened\nthis month.\nDespite the fact that the Btate crop\nreport just issued by Commissioner of\nAgriculture Cohen is not bo encour\naging for the entire state, the farmers\nof this section seem well pleased with\nthe crops for this season.\nThere has been nothing of import\nance doing during the past week eith\ner in land or in stock.\nBICYCLE\nPA BADE SIN DAT AC\nGIST 13\n2 p. m. so be on hand, tl will not be\na bicycle.\nI am just In receipt of a letter from\nThe New Departure Mfg.

P.\nPurnell and Mr. Stanton CHft are\nmaking preparations to carry the In\njunction case in regard to the County\nOil Inspector to the state Court of\nAppeals for a decision on their con\ntentions.\nThe case Is fresh in the minds of\nthe public Judge Purnell made an or\ndorappolntlng Mr. Stanton Cllft as Oil\nInspector, for Mason county and Mr.\nT. J. Rice, now serving as Inspector,\nfiled suit for an Injunction to enjoin\nhim from appointing anyone as inspec\ntor and enjoining Mr. Clift from quali\nfying as Inspector.\nThe contention of the defendants In\nthe Injunction suit were that the term\nof office to which Mr. Rice was ap\npointed had expired. They set out\nthat the act creating the office was\npaused and approved by the governor\non May 15, 1886, and that the four\nyear terms began from that date If\nthis was not the case they contended\nthat the terms at least began when\nthe next County Judge took hW\nseats which was on August 17, 1886.\nIf the terms began on these dates then\nthe term of office to which Mr. Rice\nhad beea appointed expired either on\nMay 15, 1918 or at least on AuguBt 17,\n1918, and therefore there was a va\ncancy and Judge Purnell had a right\nto appoint some one to fill the va\ncancy. The plaintiffs In the case contended\nthat the terms should be reckoned\nfrom 1889 when the first oil Inspector\nwas appointed in Mason county and\nreckonilig from this date the term had\nnot yet expired, and would not ex\npire -until 1921.\nJudge Newell In his judgment sus\ntained the Injunction sought by Mr.\nRice but he also held that the date of\nterms should be figured from Novem\nber 15, 1887, which he decided was\nthe proper date from which to reckon\nand in this case the term of the pres\nent incumbent will expire on Novem\nber 15, 1919, cutting the term Bhort\ntwo years of that contended for by\nthe plaintiff.\nThe defendants In the case still con\ntend that the term has already ex\npired, however, and will take thecaBe\nto the Btate Court of Appeals.\nPROMISED IMMUNITY, WIT-\nNESS FAILED TO SHOW UP\nClete Sharp, Chief Witness for the\nDefense in the Dresi\'I Uastady\n(\'use, Katies to Show l\'p\nFor the Trial.\nAt the trail of Walter Dresel on a\ncharge of bastardy in county court\nseveral months ago, Cleve Sharp, a\nformer Maysville man but now a resi\ndent of Cincinnati, was the chief wit\nness for the defense.\nShortly after his testimony in the\nCounty Court, the Grand Jury of Ma\nson county, then in session, returned\nan indictment against Sharp charging\nhim with false swearing. The police\nand sheriffs scattered all over the city\nbut evidently Sharp bad gotten wind\nof the indictment and had left the\ncity unseen.\nWhen the case was about to come\nup in Circuit Court on appeal ,the\nCommonwealth granted Sharp im\nmunity from arrest on this bench war\nrant but when the case was called this\nmorning Sharp did not put in his ap\npearance, evidently fearing arrest\neven though the officers had granted\nhim Immunity.\nBRADY CO\nNow Showing\nFall Clothing,\nFall Hats,\nFall Shoes,\nFall Shirts,\nFall Neckwear,\nMen\'s and Boys\' Sweaters.\nPertaining to Men\'s and Boys\' Wear.\nlino of Men\'s and Boys\' Shoes.\nPay Us i Visit\nMARKET STREETS.\nMADGE KENNEDY B The Service\nU Liko All Goldwyno, It\'o Good,\nREDS WILL\nREGISTER FOR\n\'\' SERVICE HERE\nArmy Registration to He Held All\nOver the Country Next Thursday\'\nMill List Hundreds In Mason\nCounty Many Prominent\nBusiness and Profes\nsional Men to Re\nListed.\nThe new army registration which\nhas been set for next Thursday, Sep\ntember 12, by Presidential proclama\ntion will call to the colorers hundreds\nof,our most prominent citizens in Ma-\naon county.
