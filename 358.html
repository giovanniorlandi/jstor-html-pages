This, is especially noticeable with those, who have ample means, and place, it with people who know where to, use it with the best advantage., Money is the golden wand which, touches the heart strings of broth, erly love and sympathy. With, plenty of money in his pocket the, criminal can defy public sentiment,, the law and the courts, and walk, forth a free man to receive the hom, age and cheers of those who \'bend, the knee that thrift may follow, fawning." The average criminal, has little respect for public senti, ment, and never will have, so long, as he can corrupt the channels of, justice by the clink of his golden, eagles. He is intensely practical., He hasn\'t the time to cultivate, public sentiment. When he needs, friends he buys them as be does a, cigar or a drink, and he is careful, to select only those who will be of, service to him. Under such cir, cumstances is it any wonder that, mob law is resorted to by an in, dignant and outraged public?, "There are times when it seems, to be the only remedy for existing, evils. The country passed through, such a eriod many years ago,, when it was over-run with rustlers, and \'bad men\' who defied the courts, and left a trail of blood throughout, the southwest. But the people, finally revolted, and the murderers, and thieves were swept from the, face of the earth without process, of law., "When the laws of the land are, trampled in the dust and the tem, ple of justice made a by-word and, a jest, when honest men hang their, heads in very shame, then that, hydra-headed monster called public, sentiment is aroused and a cyclone, set in motion which sweeps all be, fore it, sometimes crushing the in, nocent with the guilty. So it has, ever been, and it will continue to be.", EDITORIAL DOTS., Yavapai county redeemed 17,000, worth of 7 per cent bonds during, the month of April., Potter Palmer, for nearly half a, century one of Chicago\'s most prom, inent business men. died last Sat, urday night., The Phoenix Democrat has dis, covered that Phoenix is built over, a graveyard.

Owing to the fact, that Geo. W. Martin did not desire, the position of mayor (though en, titled to the position because of re, ceiving the majority of votes), F., R. Nellis was prevailed upon to ac, cept the office. The News extends, greeting to the new council, and, will assist, to its utmost, toward the, welfare of Williams., Archbishop Corrigan died at 1 1 :30, o\'clock Monday night. He was at, tacked by pneumonia about two, weeks ago and shortly after became, so ill grave fears were felt as to the, termination of his malady. As the, disease advanced, however, there, were encouraging signs, and no, longer ago than Sunday ha was, reported as still improving.
