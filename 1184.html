Ernest Cheatham, of Abbeville,\nwas shot and killed by Erasmus 0.Simpson,\nat Watts station, on Seaboard\nAir Line Railway, this morning\nabout ten o\'clock. Three shots were\nfired and all took effect. It appears\nfrom statements given us by those\nwho interviewed eye-witnesses that\nCheatham and Simpson were disputing\nabout the division of crops raised\non the Cheatham place, and which\nwas worked this year by Simpson.\nJust what was said before the shots\nwere fiered is not certain. Cheaitham\nis said to have attacked Simpson with\na hammer which he had in his hand.\nWhether he hit Simpson with the\nhammer before the first shot was fired\nis not certain, but it appears that\nhe did hit him on the head one time\nwith the hammer, the lick leaving an\nugly bruise, Simpson\'s arm was also\ninjured in warding off the blow, without\nwhich his skull would likely have\nbeen crushed, as Cheatham was a\npowerful mail.\nThere has been trouble between the\nparticipants since early in the year.\nIn the spring there was a fight in Abbeville\nin which Cheatham \\cut~ Simpson\nwith a pocketknife. A warrant\nwas sworn out by Simpson and Cheatham\nwas arrested but the case\' was\nlater settled in some way. At least\nthe prosecution was not pressed.\nIt is understood that Simpson\nworkted on shares with Cheatham and\nDEATH OF MRS. FRITH.\n^Friends in Abbeville of Mr. and\nMrs. W. H.

Mr. Perry was\nunanimously elected.\n"I am going to name a man from\n\'Dixie," said Mr. Burr in making the\nnomination. "Henry Grady called it\nthe "New South.\' I am proud of our\n\'New South.\' I am glad that I have\nlived during the building\' of the\n\'New South to which Mr. Grady referred;\nbut I was born long enough\nto have a deep seated love and reverence\nof the traditoins of the \'Old\nSouth.\' I am glad that I have lived to\nsee the sons of the \'Old South\' volunteer\nwith the sons of the North\nunder the Stars and Stripes in the\nSpanish-American war, under the\nleadership of General Wheeler and\nPrtinnoi Roosevelt to fight for the\nfreedom of the Cuban republic.\n"I am glad that I have lived," he\ncontniued, "to see our boys of i the\n\'New South\' join with the boys of\nthe North, of the East and of the\nWest and in France under Old\nGlory bring victory to a losing fight.\nMany of them have fought their last\nfight, and today lie buried where\nthey fell on battlefields of France,\nor rest in a watery grave.

The discussion\npovere^ effects of increased\nfares on street car traffic, the service\nat cost plan and the possibility\nof retaining the short haul passengers\nthough five cent fares. Henry\nR. Trunrbower of Wisconsin said\nways should be found to deal with\nmotorists who use their machines 10\nmonths and street cars the rest of\nthe year. The occasional street car\npassenger, he said, should pay a fixed\nsum greater than the regular\npatron. He thought this mighty be\nreached by selling monthly tickets\nat a reduction from cash fare.\nW. D. B.

This disease is fre-j \\\nquently found in damp, poorly ven- *\ntilated houses and is most often \'\ncontracted by birds that are poorly J\ndeveloped and of low vitality. Fowls j\nof this type frequently get roup and I ;\nare the means of spreading it !\nthrough the flock. Obviously, pre- j\nvention should consist of eliminating [\nthe weaklings\' from the flock and j\nproviding a house that will be dry I\nand free from drafts, but well ven- H\ntilated. I\nAn additional ,prevention against\nthis disease is the following: Add\nas much potassium permanganate H\nas will remain on the surface of a I\ndime to each gallon of drinking wa- H\nter and keep before the fowls. This H\nacts as an antiseptic and will help H\nto keep the birds in good condition. H\nAn attempt to cure the individual of E\nroup is not advisable, for, although H\nin the majority of cases, there may H\nbe an amjarent cure, the danger of iB\nreinfection is great, and frequently\nsuch birds cause the disease to\nspread throughout the flock. The\nsafest policy is immediately to remove\nsuch birds from the flock and\nkill them as soon as they show the\nfirst symptoms, recognized by a\nwatery discharge from the nostrils\nor eyes.\nGASOLINE IN ENGLAND IS\nREDUCED 6 CENTS GALLON I\nWashington, Nov. 11?"Over pro- H\nduction" in the United States is the|9\nreason assigned by British oil com-iH\npanies for an unexpected reduction H\nof six cents a gallon in the price H\nof gasoline in Great Britain after a B\nsudden increase of 14 cents a gallon H\nin Auerust, according to advices from ggj\nthe American Chamber of Commerce |H\nin London today to the Department H\nof Commerce. j?\nbecause of their desire and willing- B\nness to encourage him to enter Hj\nbroader fields of christian and fel- jffij\nlowship.

If the Medium had come out\ninto the open, it would have said that\nit was undertaking to answer the editorials\nin this paper in previous issues.\nBut let that pass.\nThe Medium speaks of the suggestions\nof this paper looking to a better\nunderstanding between the peoples i\nof all sections of the country as the ]\n"usual line of sop." That is about !\nthe language which we expected from \'.\nthe Medium, but the Medium must.]\nremember that the idea is no new ;\nidea. The best and one of the strong- ]\nest advocates of this better under- i 1\nstanding with other sections of the j\ncountry, and especially with the (]\nNorth and New England, was the la- j\nmented Henry W. Grady. In his! j\nspeech in Boston responding to the 1\ntoast, The New South, Mr. Grady \' \\\nbesought the people of this country1 <\n. to forget bias and prejudice, to lay j\nar-iJe littleness and meanness, and to 1\nlook at the problems of the country : 1\nas statesmen rather than as parti- j 1\nsans. If Mr. Grady dealt in the\'"usu-j ]\nal line of sop," we are content to ]\nfollow him?and not the Medium. j i\nPatronage and Pie. 1\'\nI.\nThe Medium next intimates thai.1\ni\nthe men here and elsewhere in the ; \'<\nSouth boost Mr. Harding on account J\n. of expected patronage, or "sleek;*\npromises." We cannot forget that the j\neditor of the Medium himself left his j\nnewspaper with its "policy" to be | j\nshaped by others and sought a small 1\npolitical appointment in Washington J J\nunder Senator Tillman. Senator Till-\' <\nman just then became a great man. i i\nWe cannot forget either that the edi- <\ntor of the Medium continued to leave 1\ni\nvacant his editorial chair and came <\nnear running the wheels off his Ford (i\nand the shoes off his feet as a kind! \'\ni\noi private sp;eiv;r xui wic uuu. <\ntie Benet, ani\' all of it for a small po-11\nlaical appointment. We do not forgeti <\neither that if he did not secure the |\nsame kind of an appointment from ^ <\nHon. W. P. Pollock it was not because \'\nhe did not seek it. Only last year, forsaking\nthe high calling of an editor |\nhe iwUght to be the money changer\nfor Abbeville County, ran all over It\n;he county begging people to vote i\n;or him and actually persuaded 77 of I\n;b?\'jnisguided to do so. We say, \\\n;heWOre, that the Medium should be i\n\'/Vjtf-?. *\nj>aroorted for accusing other people i\n>f having opinions only for patronage ]\n>r on account of promises. Its editor i\niieasures them only by his own yard- i\nstick and his hypnotic influence over I\n;he rest\' of the "force" causes them i\n,0 ao me same.\nThe men in Abbeville who believe 1\nthat Mr. Harding should have been \'\nsleeted are business men, as we have !\nsaid. They seek no office and would i\naccept none. For our own part, and 1\nthe Medium refers to us, we are glad 1\nto say that we have always been able\n:o-run. our own business and to get 1\nmorte \'remuneration and satisfaction\nrut of doing so than by seeking ofice.\nBesides, we do not believe that a\nnan who runs a newspaper, even a\ncounty newspaper such as the Medi- ,\njm and Press and Banner, should be J j\nallowed to hold office. A statute in (\nthis state making it a misdemeanor ,\nfor the editor, or owner, or part own- (\n?r of a newspaper (which undertakes\n3t advise the people on matters political)\nto accept public office of anyj\n<ind would meet with the earnest i\nrupport of this paper. We think one j\njf the troubles with the people now is j\n;hat in this state and elsewhere they!\n?re being advised by newspapers and I (\nnewspaper men with axes to grind, |\n?.nd with offices to hold, and with j (\nothers to seek. The Medium will find i (\nio more wjlling co-worker than the \',\nPress and Banner if it will advocate I (\ni measure along this line. We feel J\nthat we should be content to operate ,\nthe leading paper in Abbeville Coun-! (\nty, to advise the people unselfishly, j\nto continue to receive a just com-j]\npensaticn for what we give the peo- j\npie and to help the community as we ;,\nhave always tried to do, in all mat-;\nters, and just now in the building of\na Baptist High School. We think that I\nif the Medium will be fair it may find j\nout that most of the other men in this:\ncommunity who believed Mr. Hard-j\ning should be president are men:\nwhose activities do not carry them \'\ninto office-seeking.\nA D.fference in Principle,\nWe must take issue with the Medi-i\num on the statement that both par-!\ni\nties are at one one on the democratic\nprinciple of the Monroe Doctrine.\nThe democratic party, led blind-!\nly by Woodrow Wilson, sought to,\nabandon the good "democratic prin-j\nciple" of the Monroe Doctrine, and\n\'* *- - * AL- J Umw ? \'\nune people 01 tne uuneu owttca uy a\nmajSrity of some seven millions of,\nvotes kicked him and his party from j\n"the throne of government," and;\nturned the protection of this "demo-!\ncratic principle" over to the republi- J\ncans. The Medium, too, is far afield i\nwhen it says that the views of the two J\nParties are practically the same on\nttfe tariff question. Neither Mr. Wil- j\nson, as the leader of the democratic\nparty nor the democratic party itself,\nhas never stood for the protection of\nAmerican industry and of American\nlabor against ^he cheap products and t\nlabor of Europe and Asia. The re- i\npublican party, and that was one of!\nthe planks stressed by Mr. Harding\nin his race, promises that we shall (\nhave under it such a protective tariff ,\nis shall protect the American manu- i\nfacturer and American labor from i\nthe ill effects of competition with the i\npoorest paid labor on earth. We shall |\niiscuss the tariff later in this paper, (\nbecause an impersonal discussion of <\nthis and other questions would we t\n;hink be profitable to the people of j\n:his County. The people of this state \\\nlave been fed by the partisan newswnpvs\nnf the state on cries o! "pat- <\nonage" and "nigger" long enough.\nThey are entitled to hear the prob- ,\nems of this country discussed freely (\nand fairly and as far as we are able |\n:o do so, we expect to mform them of ,\n>ur views on these questions.\nAlways the Negro.\nThe Medium rather thinks two ^\nparties would be of "inestimable\naenefit" to this section if it were not\nfor the "the negro question." We\n:leny that there is a negro question\nn this country except as the demo+\nnvflcc arirl tVio rlpmnpvatic noli\nlicians make it a question for their\nown\' purposes. There are few negroes\nn the South who really desire to vote.\nThe constitution of South Carolina\nind the laws of other Southern States\nnake it impossible for the negro to\n:ast more than a handful of votes in\nthese states. They give no trouble in\nGeorgia with looser restrictions than\nive have. We favor making the restrictions\nboth as to education and\nproperty requirements stronger, and\nwe favor a strict enforcement of\n;he9e laws against whites and negroes\nilike. We claim that the ignorant\nlave no right to rule the country, of\nwhatever race they may be. Neither\nire we prejudiced against the wellmeaning\ncountry-loving negro, who\nprepares himself for tihe duties of cit\nzenship, owns property, and in every\nway behaves himself. The constitution\nof the United States demands\nnothing for him except what it gives\nto the white man, and surely the\nwhite man with equal opportunity\nshould be able to take care of himself.\nThere will be no "understanding"\nwith the negro as long as he is\nlawlessly treated, and nobody need\nexpect it. We say this in full realization\nthat our views are not the views\nof others, but we would be worse\nthan cowardly as a newspaper if we\ndid not speak the truth.\nGood Men and True.\nWe hope the time has arrived, and\nwith the advent of the women at the\npolls, we believe the time has arrivsd,\nwhen no unworthy politician need\nseek office in any party. If the vote\ncast in the recent election means anything\nit means that the women have\nnot voted as partisans, as do the men\nbut that they have voted for real men\nand principles. They could not stand\nMr. Cox. Whether you call him the\nbarroom politician or the government\nbonded-liquor-warehouse politician,\nevery man who reads impartially\nknows that the forces which compasssd\nhis nomination at the San Francis-~\nfVifl TirVnpVi\nwU UUIIV Clltiun aig WIIV AVA.VVW **? ?\nwould like to foster the legalized sale\nof Uqtior in this country. Taggart,\nMurphy and the rest of the bosses\nwho named him are all "wet." The\ndemocratic convention consumed forty\nbarrels of liquor taken from a\nbonded government warehouse before\nhe was nominated. It was therefore\nwet.\nWe take it that the country believes\nMr. Bryan to be an honest man and\na well informed, if not entirely well\nbalanced, statesman. had twice\nassisted Mr. Cox in his campaigns in\nOhio, and must have been his friend,\'\ni\nbut this year he refused to tske the ;\nstump for him because declared\nMr. Cox to be a "wret," and that he\'\nwas and is. It is true that the smart\ncandidate said tlia\' the legalized,\nsale of liquor wa? as dead as slavery,\nbut industrial slavery still lives, and;\nthe .liquor forces of this country only !\nyesterday won a decision from the j\nUnited .rJ\'aLc-s Supreme Court, and\nthey r.Ve fighting everywhere openly,\ncovertly, by means of the law and in\nspite of the law, to again debauch the\nland with their product. And we have\'\nreached the point that ^re shall not]\nsupport them or any candidate of\ntheir choosing for any office from\nCoroner to President. If that be\ntreason we are guni-y.\nFinally.\nThe Press and Banner has no objection\nto a \\frhite man\'s party in\nSouth Carolina for the selection of\nstate officers and for the selection of\nlocal officers. But we refuse to be\nbound by national platforms made by\nand in the interest of designing politicians\nwhich do not express our\nviews. Unless the democratic party\nin South#Carolina is willing to abandon\nthe iron-clad pledge now required\nof voters binding them to support\nthe nominees of the democratic party,\nnominated, aa was Mr. Cox, by\nche liquor and other questionable interests\nof the land, and whose candidacy\nwas undertaken to be furthered\nby misrepresentation and slander\nand not by argument, there are manymen\nwho Have cast their last ballot\nin the democratic primaries in this\nstate. They will prefer to await the\nereneral election and seek an opportunity\nto vote for men of principle\n:here, if they are offered, and if not\nto await a better day. The editor of\nthe Press and Banner is of their\nlumber. And when we get ready to\nWANTED!^\nI\nI\nWIl\'.lC i cuiiicis\ni\nTO SETTLE IN BURKE COUNTY,\nGEORGIA. SPECIAL INDUCEMENTS\nOFFERED.

The patron is allowed to look\nat n long, serpentine bill of fare which\nseems to present untold possibilities\nfor 50 cents, but after reading it all\nthe way through and deciding to order\neverything in sight he stumbles\nonto a few lines of brusque fine print\nwhich eliminates everything but the\nroast beef and iced tea.

It is esftimated that!\nthe American hotel makes more money\noff ?he table d\'hote victim than It .\ndoes ofT the six by nine sample room\nwith a North pole temperature.\nThe main idea back of the table 1\nd\'hote dinner, however, is to drive the ;\npatrons into the open jaws of the a la 11\ncarte service.

Until\ncan open up channels whereby we\na nexport or ship cotton into foreign\nnarkets, I see no chance for better\n\'rices. The European conutries are\nur greatest consumers of American\notton. Their spinners are now ready\no begin operation, but they have no\noton. We propose to ship them coton\nand let them start up right away.\nThe American Products Exports\nnd Import corporation is being oranized\nentirely by Southern farmrs\nand business men f/>r your bene- ,\nit. We hav? been going to the other\nellow and begging^for help for the\niast 50 years to no avail, and it is\niow time for us to help ourselves,\nnd we will have to help ourselves if\ntre ever get help. Already a million\nnd a quarter of dollars worth of\ntock have been raised by more than\ni,000 subscribers. A charter will be\naken out this week and it is believd\nthat business will commence right\nway. Anderson County has already\naised nearly $100,000 and will raise\nlore.
