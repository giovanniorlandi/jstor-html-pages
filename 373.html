        <pre>['215\n“From local to national politics, the state, the party, and the personal interests of \nelites have merged into one machine.”\nA Cambodian Fusion of Personality,\nParty, and the State\nKOSAL PATH\nAfter Cambodia’s latest general election on \nJuly 29, 2018, Prime Minister Hun Sen and \nhis Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) declared\na crushing victory, claiming that they had \ntaken 77.5 percent of the vote and all 125 seats in \nthe National Assembly. The result was unsurprising,\ngiven that the main opposition party had been \nbanned since last year. But the question remains: \nWhy has Cambodia, after pursuing a democratic \ntransition since United Nations–sponsored elections\nin 1993, slid back into undiluted authoritari-\nanism?\nIn the summer of 2017, Hun Sen’s government \nand the CPP launched attacks on the political opposition,\nthe independent press, and civil society that \nwere unprecedented in their ferocity. The regime \nalleged that there was a grand conspiracy afoot \nbetween the Cambodian National Rescue Party \n(CNRP) and nongovernmental organizations, assisted\nby the Central Intelligence Agency, to stage a \n“color revolution” and overthrow the government. \nA powerful CPP lawmaker, Chheang Vun, began \ndenouncing US-based civil society groups such as \nthe National Democratic Institute (NDI), the National\nEndowment for Democracy (NED), Free-\ndom House, and the Open Society Foundations. \nVun also accused foreign-owned media including \nthe Cambodia Daily, Voice of America, and Radio \nFree Asia of serving as “tools” of the West, especially\nthe United States, to weaken the ruling party \nand help the opposition. Leaks revealing details of \nthe purported plot featured prominently in proCPP\nmedia outlets like the website Fresh News.\nIn August 2017, Fresh News republished several\nposts from a Facebook page called Kon Khmer \n(Khmer Child), which advanced the narrative that \na slew of conspirators including the CNRP, the CIA, \nthe US embassy, NGOs, and journalists were in on \nthe plot. Several foreigners, notably freelance reporter\nGeoffrey Cain and US embassy political of-\nficer Sam Downing, were accused of being spies \nwith close links with CNRP leader Kem Sokha’s \ntwo daughters. Downing allegedly was not only an \nundercover CIA agent but also in a romantic relationship\nwith Sokha’s eldest daughter. \nKem Sokha was arrested September 3 on charges\nof conspiring with the United States to topple \nthe government, which Sokha and Washington \nboth denied. Former opposition leader Sam Rainsy\nwas already in exile, facing jail time if he set \nfoot on Cambodian soil. On November 16, Cambodia’s\nSupreme Court ordered the dissolution of \nthe CNRP on charges of treason. (Article 38, one of \nseveral amendments to the 1997 Political Parties \nLaw swiftly enacted in February 2017 by the CPP \nmajority in the National Assembly, gives broad \ndiscretion to the interior ministry to file a complaint\nwith the Supreme Court to dissolve a politi-\ncal party on vague grounds.) \nAfter a five-hour trial and two hours of deliberation,\nthe presiding judge (and senior CPP \nofficial) Dith Munty shut down the CNRP and \nbanned 118 of its senior officials from any political\nactivity for five years, effective immediately. \nThe hearing was one-sided since the CNRP declined\nto send legal representation—a move cited \nby Munty as an admission of guilt. The court’s \nruling was final, with no possibility of appeal.\nThese drastic measures, just months ahead of \nthe general election in July, were sure to undermine\nCambodia’s democratic process, delegitimize \nthe ruling party’s inevitable victory, and compel \nthe United States and the European Union to impose\ntargeted economic sanctions. What motivat-\ned Hun Sen to take such risks? \nKOSAL PATH is an assistant professor of political science at \nBrooklyn College, City University of New York.\n', '216 • CURRENT HISTORY • September 2018\nThe proximate cause of the ruling party’s radical \nactions was undoubtedly fear of losing power to \nthe CNRP in a free and fair election. Without institutionalized\nmechanisms of succession in place \nto guarantee CPP elites safety from political vengeance,\nHun Sen and his colleagues are clearly de-\ntermined to cling to power—at least until they can \nsecure a dynastic succession for their offspring. In \nthe run-up to the July 2018 elections, the prime \nminister insisted, according to the Khmer Times, \nthat any successor “must come from the Cambodian\nPeople’s Party, because only children of an angel \nwould succeed an angel.” \nRecent elections had revealed growing support\nfor the opposition. In the 2013 elections, the \nCNRP won 55 out of 123 seats in the National Assembly.\nThe opposition received approximately \n2.9 million votes (44 percent), while the CPP took \n3.2 million. Then in the June 2017 local elections, \nthe CNRP won 489 communes to the CPP’s 1,156, \na dramatic improvement on the 40 communes the \nopposition won in 2012, when it competed separately\nas the Sam Rainsy Party \nand the Human Rights Party. \nThese shocking results—the \nCPP had dominated in every \nelection from 2002 to 2012—\nraised the prospect of a CPP defeat\nin July 2018 or a political \ndeadlock if it could not win a \nsolid majority. Under those circumstances, eliminating\nthe CNRP was a logical step to ensure the \nruling party’s success in the July elections and beyond.\nThere are multiple other background causes for \nthis recent authoritarian turn, including Hun Sen’s \npersonality cult, the increased costs of maintaining \npolitical domination, and the convergence of strategic\ninterests between the ruling parties in Cam-\nbodia and China in rolling back Western influence \nand quashing domestic proponents of liberal democracy.\nThe correlation of these forces provided \nthe CPP with additional impetus to take the radical \nstep of dissolving the main opposition party.\nFATHER FIGURE\nFrom his early career as a guerrilla fighting the \nUS-backed Lon Nol regime in the early 1970s, to \nhis stint as foreign minister in the early 1980s, to \nhis record as the longest-serving prime minister \nof Cambodia, in office since 1985, Hun Sen has \nearned his reputation as a strong, stubborn, and \nresilient leader with shrewd political instincts. \nAs a deputy regimental commander, Hun Sen \nnarrowly escaped a Khmer Rouge purge and fled \nto Vietnam in June 1977. He outmaneuvered his \ncomrade Pen Sovann and won overwhelming support\nfrom his Vietnamese patrons and Cambodian \ncolleagues in 1985 to become prime minister of \nthe People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK)—a \nMarxist-Leninist regime (1979–89) propped up by \nthe Vietnamese—at the age of 33, making him the \nyoungest prime minister in the world at that time. \nTo eliminate the military threat that the Chinabacked\nKhmer Rouge posed to its southwestern \nborder since 1975, Vietnam, with support from \nthe Soviet Union, had invaded Cambodia in December\n1978. Then the Vietnamese built a social-\nist regime in Cambodia in an attempt to root out \nChinese influence and strengthen their influence \nin the Soviet bloc.\nWhen he was serving as deputy prime minister \nin the coalition government that was formed after \nthe UN-sponsored free and fair election in 1993, \nHun Sen and his allies successfully staged a coup \nin July 1997 against the prime \nminister, Prince Norodom \nRanariddh of the royalist party \nFUNCINPEC, and then neutralized\nits founder, King Norodom \nSihanouk. A year later, Hun \nSen’s “Win-Win Policy” brought \nthe Cambodian civil war to an \nend, and he has presided over sustained economic \ngrowth for the past two decades. His policy was \nbased on an amnesty-for-peace strategy consisting \nof three guarantees for Khmer Rouge soldiers and \ntheir commanders, namely immunity from prosecution,\npositions in the government and armed \nforces, and individual ownership rights, especially \nto housing and farmland.\nA tight-knit alliance of loyalists and family \nmembers is a central aspect of Hun Sen’s long hold \non power and his ability to neutralize political \nopponents within both his own party and the opposition.\nHe plays the role of father figure in an \nextended family, sharing the spoils of his rule. He \nis willing to defend members of his family even \nwhen this may displease other senior party members.\nFor instance, in the 2013 general elections \nand the 2017 commune elections, Hun Sen’s elder\nbrother Hun Neng failed to deliver Kampong \nCham—their home province, where he served as \ngovernor. Yet he and Deputy Prime Minister Yim \nChhay Ly, whose daughter is married to Hun Sen’s \nson, were still placed at the top of the CPP list of \nThe patronage system  \nhas widened the gap  \nbetween rich and poor.\n', 'Fusion of Personality, Party, and the State • 217\ncandidates for Kampong Cham in the July 2018 \nelection. This time they ran unopposed since the \nopposition had been dissolved a year before.\nThis is just one example of Hun Sen’s giving priority\nto loyalty over competence, a tendency that \ncontinues to plague the CPP. His consolidation of \npower has elevated family members and ardent \nloyalists to top positions in the government, the \nparty, the armed forces, the national intelligence \nagency, economic management, mass media, and \nyouth organizations. The patronage system is organized\nwith a clear intent to facilitate a dynastic \nsuccession and hobble the opposition. \nIn 1998, Hun Sen told his unofficial biographers \nHarish and Julie Mehta that he read with pleasure \nthe works of Luong Preah (His Royal Highness)\nSdech Kan, a commoner who usurped the throne \nand briefly reigned over the Khmer kingdom in the \nsixteenth century. In December 2017, a New York \nTimes report noted that Sdech Kan “seems to be \neverywhere, thanks to Prime Minister Hun Sen—\nanother common man turned near-absolute ruler, \nwho has been so intent on identifying himself with \nthe semi-mythical figure that some suspect he \nconsiders himself the king’s reincarnation.” Hun \nSen sponsored research by a pro-government historian,\nRos Chantrabot, to discover the location of \nthe commoner king’s capital, and wrote a forward \nfor Ros’s book on Sdech Kan. In 2017, Ly Yong \nPhat, a tycoon with close ties to Hun Sen, reportedly\nfinanced a movie about Sdech Kan, directed \nby Mao Ayuth, a secretary of state at the Ministry \nof Information. The scholar Astrid Norén-Nilsson, \nwho has extensively studied Hun Sen’s fascination \nwith Sdech Kan, concurs that the prime minister \nbelieves himself to be a reincarnation of the legendary\npeasant king.\nThere is, however, a notable difference. Hun Sen \nis in a position to define his own legacy. Sdech Kan \nwas overthrown and killed after just four years on \nthe throne by a full-blooded prince reasserting his \nfamily’s right to rule. \nAs Hun Sen ages, ensuring his legacy seems \nto have become an obsession. Recently his loyalists\nhave stepped up their efforts to enshrine the \nofficial narrative of his sacrifices, heroism, and \nwise leadership in the nation’s collective memory.\nEvidence of this is everywhere—from school \nbuildings around the country that bear the prime \nminister’s name to a grand monument and museum\ndedicated to his “Win-Win Policy,” under \nconstruction on the outskirts of the capital city, \nPhnom Penh. The government-sponsored documentary\nfilm Marching Toward National Salvation \nportrays Hun Sen as the national hero who risked \nhis life to liberate the Cambodian people from Pol \nPot’s genocidal Khmer Rouge regime (1975–79).\nHun Sen has used the UN-backed Khmer Rouge \ntribunal to prosecute four leading figures in the \nregime: Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan, \nand Kaing Guek Eav. When he addresses survivors \nof the genocide, he can claim to have brought the \nKhmer Rouge leadership to justice. But he has also \nkept his promises to spare former Khmer Rouge \ncommanders and soldiers from prosecution. By \nagreeing to allow the UN to play a limited role in \nthe tribunal, Hun Sen was able to attract significant\naid, mostly from Western governments. \nThe rivalry between Hun Sen and the opposition\nleaders Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha has been \ndeeply personal. Such personal conflicts reinforce \nthe pervasive fear within the CPP’s elite circles that \nthey and their families would be subject to persecution\nor execution if the opposition took power, \nmuch as the Khmer Rouge regime did to its perceived\nand real enemies.\nHun Sen’s political cunning has enabled him to \nhold on to power for more than three decades. He \nhas succeeded in getting rid of the CNRP, the only \nviable challenger to his power, without facing mass \nprotests or other domestic political consequences. \nAs China’s backing for Hun Sen increases, the \nWest’s collective pressure on the ruling party to \nrestore a legitimate democratic process is waning.\nCONVERGENCE OF INTERESTS\nLong-term changes in the regional and international\npolitical environments have favored Cambo-\ndia’s ruling party. In the West, the 2016 election of \nDonald Trump coincided with the rise of populist \nnationalism in Europe. Under Trump, the United \nStates has turned inward: his administration has \npursued an agenda of populist and economic nationalism\nat home and shown little interest in pro-\nmoting democracy and human rights abroad. \nMeanwhile, the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) has turned into an authoritarians’\nclub with members including the communist \nparty in Vietnam, a military junta in Thailand, the \nmilitary-dominated democratic system in Myanmar,\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte’s populist authori-\ntarianism in the Philippines, and Singapore’s dynastic\nruling party. These trends emboldened Hun \nSen and the radical faction within the ruling party, \nbut it was China’s strong support that gave them \ncover to terminate the main opposition party.\n', '218 • CURRENT HISTORY • September 2018\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) recognizes \nCambodia as China’s closest ally in Southeast Asia. \nSince the 2012 ASEAN summit, when Cambodia \nmade a strategic decision to back China’s territorial \nclaims in the South China Sea, Beijing has rewarded\nHun Sen generously with economic and military \nassistance and all-out political support. China overtook\nthe United States as Cambodia’s main trading \npartner in 2014; by the end of 2017, according to \nthe Nikkei Asian Review, China’s total investment \ncapital in Cambodia reached $17.5 billion—in a \ncountry where nominal gross domestic product is \njust over $20 billion. In 2017, 1.2 million Chinese \ntourists visited Cambodia, a 50-percent increase \nfrom the year before and the most from any country.\nChina’s strong backing has convinced Hun Sen \nand his colleagues that their regime can stave off \nthe West’s political and economic pressure.\nThe CCP and the CPP share a common goal of \nrolling back Western influence in Cambodia, but \nfor different reasons. In this highly asymmetric alliance,\nBeijing wants to rid its small ally of Viet-\nnamese and Western influence and deepen Cambodia’s\nreliance on China to the point where it \nis left without any recourse. The ruling party in \nCambodia aims to end the West’s one-sided support\nfor the opposition.\nChinese influence has penetrated all levels of \nCambodian society, from the military, economy, \nand politics to the social and cultural spheres. \nThe close linkage between business and political \nelites in both countries has left its mark on major \ndevelopment projects, youth organizations, the \nmedia, and even academic research centers. In addition\nto bringing Chinese factories to provincial \ntowns, China’s public diplomacy in Cambodia also \nfacilitates the ruling party’s distribution of goods \nto villagers. For instance, China sends doctors on \na regular basis to augment the CPP’s provision of \nfree health services through mobile clinics. These \ndeepening exchanges further cement the SinoCambodian\nalliance.\nCOSTLY PATRONAGE\nSince 1998, the costs of political domination have \nincreased. Hun Sen’s populist agenda deepened his \ndependency on foreign aid and business elites with \nclose ties to the ruling party, known as Oknha. (In \nthe early Khmer kingdom, this term referred to a \ntitle or status the Khmer kings awarded to court officials\nin return for their loyalty.) The elite pact co-\nordinated Oknha business interests within a clientpatron\nrelationship with the ruling party. \nThe CPP’s rule largely depends on the continued \ndistribution of selective goods, which has become \nincreasingly expensive. (Selective goods is a term \nfor public goods and services that a government \nprovides to selected recipients rather than equally \ndistributing them to the entire population.) To provide\nthese roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, and \nassorted handouts, the CPP depends on the flow of \ncash from Oknha. In return, they gain private access\nto government resources, development plans, \nmajor construction contracts, and other privileges, \nwhich have brought them large profits.\nPopular perceptions of the ruling party have \nalready drastically changed as a consequence of \nthese client-patron networks. The CPP is becoming\nan elite-serving party, gradually drifting away \nfrom the majority of poor peasants and the working\nclass. In material terms, the CPP’s patronage \nsystem has widened the gap between rich and \npoor, causing socioeconomic cleavages to widen \nand popular discontent to brew within Cambodian\nsociety during the past three decades.\nThe CNRP took advantage of rising resentment\nover the ruling party’s endemic corrup-\ntion, widespread nepotism, disdain for the rule \nof law, and failed reforms. The opposition party \nbuilt a formidable coalition of urban intellectuals,\ncivil servants, poor peasants, and workers. \nAs Chheang Vannarith, a Cambodian political \nanalyst, observed in the Khmer Times in February\n2017, “The CNRP’s populist policies focus on \nanti-establishment and political change. Its social \nand economic policies emphasize the livelihoods \nof factory workers, farmers, elderly people, and \nother vulnerable groups.”\nIncreased popular support for the CNRP forced \nthe CPP to respond with even more lavish distributions\nof free selective goods to dissuade its voters \nfrom defecting to the opposition. The ruling party \noffered gifts in cash and in kind, cheap electricity,\npay raises for garment factory workers and \ngovernment employees, free health care, and new \nroads and bridges. For instance, to win over garment\nand footwear workers, an important voting \nbloc for the CNRP in the 2013 and 2017 elections, \nHun Sen promised to raise their monthly minimum\nwage from $170 in 2018 to $250 by the next \nelection cycle in 2023. This runs the risk of chipping\naway at Cambodia’s competitiveness and dis-\ncouraging future investment.\nAs the CPP’s campaign in the run-up to the July \nelection revealed, districts that demonstrate the \nstrongest support for the ruling party are now giv-\n', 'Fusion of Personality, Party, and the State • 219\nen priority for selective goods, financed by a mixture\nof funding from the party representative in \neach district, the central government, and Chinese \naid. This populist campaign has widened the ruling\nparty’s client-patron network, deepening cor-\nruptive practices and perpetuating a cycle of buying\nshort-term political victories at a high price.\nUNEASY ELITES\nSeveral CPP insiders told me privately that the \nruling party has fully realized that widespread corruption\nis a cancer that continues to undermine \nreform agendas and erode people’s trust in the party.\nAn extraordinary congress of the CPP in January \n2018 called for reforms to focus on public administration,\nfinancial management, and decentraliza-\ntion as a means of escaping dependency on foreign \naid, spreading economic development from urban \nto rural areas, and reducing poverty.\nHowever, to prevent any internal fracture, nepotism\nand incompetent officials are still tolerated \nwithin the top echelons of the government and \nparty. Officials at the local level \ndo further damage to the CPP’s \nimage with their corrupt practices\nsuch as demanding bribes \nfrom local businesses or parties \nin land disputes. Nonetheless, \nthanks to the state resources at \nits disposal and the strengths \nof its political organization from the center to the \nlocal districts, the ruling party remains the most \ncoherent and robust political organization in Cambodia.\nOf course, sustained repression has also \nbeen part of the CPP’s strategy to keep the opposition\nweak and divided.\nThe elites within the CPP disagree on how to \nmaintain their party’s dominant position. They fall \ninto two broad though not always clear-cut categories,\nwith moderates having a clear preference \nfor performance-based legitimacy and conservatives\nfor inducing compliance through repression. \nThe moderates are system reformers who believe \nthat the CPP’s continued rule depends on stemming\ncorruption, strengthening the rule of law, \nenforcing meritocracy, and distributing development\nprojects away from urban districts to rural \nareas. The conservatives are system maintainers \nwho believe in keeping power through populist \nnationalism and continued repression. Both, however,\nprefer a political system with one dominant \nparty (so-called “Cambodian-style democracy”). \nThe moderate political elites tend to be secondgeneration\nCPP leaders and well-educated tech-\nnocrats, while the conservatives are mostly Hun \nSen loyalists within the high command of the state \nsecurity forces who rose to power in the aftermath \nof the 1997 coup or old hands from the PRK era.\nAt the local level, the moderates focus on issuespecific\nproblem-solving and building a strong \npolitical organization capable of door-to-door \ncampaigns. Typical village-level issues include \nproviding new jobs for farmers, safe drinking water,\nirrigation systems, health clinics, scholarships \nfor new high-school graduates, and so on. \nThe moderates also exhibit concern over certain\naspects of Chinese activities and behavior in \nCambodia in spite of the huge amounts of investment\nand tourism pouring into the country from \nChina. For instance, emerging Chinese enclaves \nin the nation’s major tourism destinations, such \nas Sihanoukville, have often spurred local Cambodians’\nresentment. This is becoming a political \nliability for the ruling party.\nSince 1998, when the CPP and the royalists \nreached a coalition deal, the \nCPP expected to see the United \nStates and its Western allies \nchange their attitude toward \nCambodia, shifting away from \none-sided support for the opposition.\nIn the moderates’ view, \nthe West’s constant criticism of \nHun Sen has empowered the radical faction within \nthe CPP. Conservatives are convinced that the West \nhas actively supported the opposition with the \naim of removing Hun Sen and the CPP from power \nthrough either elections or a violent popular uprising.\nIn the summer of 2017, the moderate fac-\ntion engaged in self-censorship and refrained from \nengaging with the West for fear of being framed \nas disloyal to the party or having their patriotism \nquestioned, while the conservatives escalated their \nclaims of collusion between the CNRP and the CIA \nto overthrow Hun Sen’s government.\nPOST-DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION\nHow might the CPP, which emerged as a communist\nparty in the 1980s under Vietnamese oc-\ncupation, appease a younger, more educated, and \ntech-savvy population eager for change? The CPP \npresents these citizens with a false binary choice \nbetween peace and development under its continued\nrule or a bleak alternative of war and poverty \nwith the opposition in power. It is true that the CPP \nhas brought about impressive economic developHun\nSen believes himself  \nto be a reincarnation of a  \nlegendary peasant king.\n', '220 • CURRENT HISTORY • September 2018\nment and a significant reduction in poverty since \nit took power in 1998, but inequality has also increased.\nThe majority of Cambodians, especially \nthe nearly three million people who voted for the \nCNRP in 2013, want a free and fair election—and \nare infuriated by the party’s dissolution.\nIn the July 2018 election, about 600,000 voters, \nor 8.6 percent of the electorate, cast inadmissible \nballots—a gesture widely seen as a protest. This \nsuggests political opposition to the ruling party remains\na potent force, awaiting an opportunity for \na resurgence.\nNonetheless, the CPP’s elites appear to believe \nthat as long as they can maintain the trajectory \nof economic development and speed up reforms, \nthey can calm restless citizens and give them hope \nfor a brighter future. Also, when there is no serious \ncompetition or contestation, distributing selective \ngoods to poor people who have no alternative or \nregular access to state resources and economic activities\nbecomes much less costly. The result is a \nfusion of political personality, the party, and the \nstate in a system designed to \neliminate opposition and ensure\npopular acquiescence.\nThis reasoning was made \nexplicit in the strategies that \nCPP party cells employed in \ntheir campaign for the July \n2018 elections. Their propaganda\nmessage to voters went something like \nthis: “If the CPP wins more than 50 percent of the \nvote in your district, our party cell wins. However,\nif the CPP wins more than 90 percent in our \ndistrict, then we will be the best party cell in the \nwhole country. When that happens, our requests \nfor resources will be given priority by our prime \nminister.” \nIn rural areas, CPP party cells have already taken\nsteps to enable peasants to earn extra income. \nGetting factories built in their districts is a favored \napproach. Factories create jobs for unemployed \nyoung people, which serves to increase the number\nof party supporters, but can also be a political \nliability for the ruling party. When foreign companies\nthat built factories in Cambodia abused \nworkers’ rights, the opposition was able to capitalize\non the conflict. In a report released in March \n2015, Human Rights Watch cited alleged abuses \nat Cambodian subcontractor garment factories \nthat supply major brands like Marks & Spencer, \nAdidas, and Armani. Workers’ rights continue to \nbe violated due to “the envelope system”—factory \nmanagers hand bribes to visiting inspectors in exchange\nfor favorable reports.\nCPP party cells have made a concerted attempt \nto minimize such political liabilities at the local \nlevel. Each party cell has local inspectors to hear \nworkers’ complaints and quickly raise their concerns\nwith the factory management. Party cells \nhave also created prochea-kapea units (citizen \nguards at the village level) to beef up local security \nin the absence of a competent police force and to \nmonitor the political opposition’s activities without\ngiving the appearance of direct intimidation.\nIn addition, core teams of political operatives, \nwho are both government employees and party \nmembers, are always on site to address villagers’ \nconcerns and distribute selective goods. A party \nleader can monitor his or her core team’s activities\nin real time via mobile phones and social net-\nworking platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, \nand direct them to address specific problems in \nthe district such as bringing mobile clinics to remote\nvillages, fixing wooden bridges, or provid-\ning emergency assistance after \nfloods. This network of grassroots\npolitical organizations is \na new tool for maintaining political\ndomination. From local \nto national politics, the state, \nthe party, and the personal interests\nof elites have merged \ninto one machine.\nRegular news updates about the government’s \nplans for construction of new satellite cities, skyscrapers,\nairports, roads, bridges, overpasses, \nmonorails, and shopping malls have drowned \nout calls for a true democracy. In stark contrast to \nthe international community’s condemnation of \nthe ruling party and Hun Sen himself for attacks \non the opposition, civil society, and independent \nmedia, regular topics of conversation at cafés in \nPhnom Penh include real estate transactions and \nonline shopping. Modern supermalls, IMAX movie\ntheaters, five-star hotels, high-end restaurants, \nand casinos have offered urban dwellers a taste of \nluxury under Hun Sen’s regime. Although these attractions\nhave become playgrounds for the upper \nclass, the alluring image of economic development \nand consumerist aspiration has given the rest of the \npopulation hopes and dreams of their own, and the \nperception that the nation is moving in the right \ndirection under the CPP.\nThe ruling party’s motivation to eliminate its \nonly viable political opposition in the summer of \nBeijing has rewarded Hun Sen  \ngenerously with economic  \nand military assistance.\n', 'Fusion of Personality, Party, and the State • 221\n2017 is to be found in the confluence of these individual,\ndomestic, and external factors. Hun Sen’s \npersonal quest for power and glory, and the bitter \nanimosity between him and the opposition leaders,\nhave made compromise, reconciliation, and \ntrust-building nearly impossible. Without any \ninstitutionalized mechanisms for succession that \nwould ensure their safety and privileges in the \nevent of defeat, losing power to the opposition is \nunthinkable for the ruling party’s leadership. \nChanges in the external political environment \nalso favored Hun Sen’s inclination to rid himself of \nthe opposition party. He was encouraged by China’s\nstrong support and further emboldened by di-\nvisions in the Western alliance and the resurgence \nof authoritarianism in Southeast Asia, Europe, and \neven the United States. \nAfter the July 2018 election, the fusion of personality\ncult, party, and state is likely to become \nentrenched as a new political order designed by \nthe ruling party to perpetuate its hegemony. Until \na new correlation of domestic and international \nforces compels the regime to return to free and \nfair elections as the primary means of conflict \nresolution, Cambodia is on a fast track to unrestrained\nauthoritarian rule. !\n']</pre>
