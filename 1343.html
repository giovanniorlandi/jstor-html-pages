GREEN\nThis study examines events associated with identity status change between late\nadolescence and mid-adulthood. One hundred adults, aged 40–63 years, participated\nin a retrospective study of identity development. An adaptation of Marcia’s\n(1966) Identity Status Interview was used to examine identity status movements\nwithin five identity domains. For each identity transition, the event judged to be\nprimarily responsible for precipitating change was coded as follows: “age-graded,”\n“history-graded,” “critical,” “family life cycle stage,” “different milieu,” “internal\nchange,” “influence of significant other,” and “lack of opportunity”. “Internal\nchange” was associated with the greatest frequency of changes into achievement,\nmoratorium, and diffusion statuses across most domains; “influence of a significant\nother” was most commonly associated with the transition to foreclosure in most\ndomains. Few significant associations were found among identity status, event\ntype, and demographic variables within each identity domain. Implications of\nthese findings for our understanding of identity formation are briefly discussed.\n\uf6d9 1996 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents\nIntroduction\nThe relationship between contextual or situational variables and the process of identity\ndevelopment has been the subject of much theoretical discussion but little empirical\ninvestigation following the writings of Erik Erikson on the identity formation process of late\nadolescence (Erikson, 1959, 1968). Erikson conceptualized identity in psychosocial terms,\nnoting the importance of historical ethos and cultural and social milieu in conjunction with\nbiological capacities and idiosyncratic individual needs and defenses to the development of\na sense of ego identity:\nWe must find the nexus of social images and of organismic forces—and this is not merely in the\nsense that here images and forces are, as the saying goes, ‘interrelated.’ More than this: the\nmutual complementation of ethos and ego, of group identity and ego identity, puts a greater\ncommon potential at the disposal of both ego synthesis and social organization (Erikson, 1959,\npp. 22–23).\nIt is in that process of ego synthesis that individuals draw upon their individually unique\ncapacities in differential response to their social milieus: “Thus, different capacities use\ndifferent opportunities to become full-grown components of the ever-new configuration that\nis the growing personality” (Erikson, 1959, p. 57).\nEmpirical investigation in the social psychology literature of the relationship between\nsituational or contextual variables and personality development has generally pointed\ntoward ways in which situational variables set broad limits on probable behaviours, but\npersonality variables, considered alone or in combination, are most likely to predict the\nReprint requests and correspondence should be addressed to Dr J. Kroger, Psychology Department, University of\nTromsø, N-9037 Tromsø, Norway.\n0140-1971/96/050477+14/$18.00/0 \uf6d9 1996 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents\n', '478 J. Kroger and K. E. Green\nparticular choice of behaviour patterns within these broader limits (e.g. Stewart, 1980;\nJames, 1990; Flanagan, 1990). For example, Stewart’s research on women’s choice of lifestyle\nhas indicated that while family situation variables such as being married and having\nchildren may set broad limits on some behaviours, personality variables predict the\nparticular response an individual makes to these circumstances. James’ analysis of women’s\nemployment histories (in terms of labour force entrance and exit patterns) in relation to\nindicators of well-being suggests that well-being at mid-life is not determined as much by\nlife-style choice as by “the extent to which one’s endeavours are reflections of identity\nresolutions” (James, 1990, p. 118). Flanagan’s (1990) overview of research on economic\nrecession and parent–child relationships points to the impact of changes in parental work\nstatus on adolescent behaviour.\nWithin the identity development literature, empirical studies have generally suggested a\nsimilar relationship between situational and personality variables, although this literature\nremains in its infancy. Kroger and Haslett (1987, 1991) found that when situational\nvariables such as age, level of education, socio-economic status, marital status, and parental\nstatus were controlled in a retrospective study of identity development by mid-life adults,\nparticipants still demonstrated different pathways of identity formation and made different\nlife-style choices. Similarly, Adams and Fitch (1983) found that certain university\ndepartmental environments appeared to attract certain types of students, but once students\nwere in departments, there were different factors that emerged to facilitate the identity\nformation process. The researchers found, for example, that societal awareness, encouraged\nby faculty or peers, was one condition that helped students to broaden their perspectives on\nidentity-related issues. Environmental or situational factors that may set broad limits on\nprobable behaviours and be associated with identity exploration or arrest are in need of\nfurther investigation in the identity development literature and will be the focus of the\npresent investigation.\nIn researching the identity formation process, Marcia’s (1966; Marcia et al. , 1993)\nidentity status model has been a popular means of elaborating and refining Erikson’s\noriginal theoretical notions on identity. Drawing upon Erikson’s psychosocial definition of\nego identity, Marcia proposed four approaches one might take in attempting to resolve (or\nnot) meaningful identity-defining commitments to vocational, ideological, and relationship\nroles offered within one’s larger social and cultural milieu. Marcia depicted the identity\nachieved as one who had entered into identity-defining commitments on his or her own\nterms, following an active period of reflection, exploration, and decision-making. The\nmoratorium individual was in the process of exploration, attempting to find meaningful lifedirections\nexpressive of personal interests and talents. The foreclosed individual, like the\nidentity achieved, had formed commitments; however, these were made without\nexploration or thoughtful self-reflection and were generally based on the commitments of\nsignificant others. The diffused, similar to the moratorium, was not yet committed to\nmeaningful life-directions; however, unlike the moratorium, the diffused evidenced little\ninterest in seeking commitments to psychosocial roles or values expressive of personal\ninterests or beliefs. Marcia’s identity status model will serve as the framework for an\nexploration of contexts and events associated with identity status transitions—transitions\ninvolving identity exploration, commitment, and/or arrest for a sample of mid-life adults in\nthe present research.\nThe present study focuses on events associated with identity status change for a sample of\n100 mid-life adults who were asked to reflect upon their own identity formation process\n', '479Events and identity status change\nfrom adolescence through middle-adulthood. Participants were aged 40–63 years and\nprovided extensive retrospective interview accounts for identity-defining decisions that had\nor had not been made within the psychosocial domains of vocational, religious, political,\nsex role, and intimate relationship values. Individuals came from upper-middle and upper\nincome occupational groups, whose decisions in the above identity-defining domains were\nless likely to have been constrained by financial circumstances.\nPathways of identity status movements for these individuals have been described in two\nprevious studies (Kroger and Haslett, 1987, 1991), where Waterman’s (1982) descriptive\nmodel of possible identity status changes served as the basis for examining the duration and\ntiming of identity status movements within the five identity domains of vocation, religion,\npolitics, sex role values, and relationships. From the Kroger and Haslett investigations, the\nmost common pathway of identity status movement for all sample subgroups in most\nidentity domains was from foreclosure to moratorium to achievement; however, the\nduration and timing of this transition varied markedly across domains. Factors associated\nwith such transitions have not previously been empirically examined.\nWhile a longitudinal design represents the ideal in examining both the direction and\ntiming of identity status change as well as factors that may be associated with such\ntransitions, a retrospective method was used in the present exploratory study in order to\ngain some preliminary understandings of the types of events or situational contexts that\nmay be differentially associated with identity status movements across identity domains.\nWhile every effort was made through preliminary questionnaires and intensive interviews to\nensure the accuracy and timing of key events reportedly associated with changing\ncommitments to identity-defining issues, this study must, nevertheless, remain exploratory,\nsuggestive of relationships that might fruitfully be examined in future longitudinal\ninvestigations of identity development over the course of the adolescent and adult life-span.\nThe present investigation questions whether or not there may be certain “types” of\nevents and/or situational contexts that are associated with identity status change.\nSpecifically, the following issues guided the direction of this study:\n1. Across identity domains (vocation, religion, politics, sex role values, relationships),\nare there differences in types of events associated with identity status change?\n2. Within each of the five identity domains, are there significant associations among\ndemographic variables (age span, sex, age group, education level, percentage of time in paid\nemployment, life-style pattern, marital, and parental status), identity status, and event type?\n3. Within each of the five identity domains, what types of events are most commonly\nassociated with transition to each identity status (achievement, moratorium, foreclosure,\ndiffusion)?\nMethod\nSubjects\nSubjects for this study were 100 mid-life New Zealanders (40 men and 60 women). All were\naged between 40–63 years (mean ages for men and women were 48·3 years and 46·3 years,\nrespectively), and all participants or their spouses had an occupation classed as Level 1\n(Professional) or Level 2 (Managerial) on the Elley–Irving Socio-economic Index for New\nZealand (Elley and Irving, 1981). Socio-economic status has been associated with\ndifferences in developmental change (Neugarten, 1968); thus, the present sample was\n', '480 J. Kroger and K. E. Green\nrestricted to upper- and upper-middle class income groups who were less likely to have\nexperienced financial constraints impinging upon identity-defining decisions in vocational,\nreligious, political, sex-role, and relationship pursuits.\nSubjects were contacted through a networking sampling technique. Initially, 12 adult\nstudents in continuing education courses and meeting the age and socio-economic criteria\nfor the study (40–65 years of age and from a household having an adult holding a\nprofessional or managerial work role) volunteered to participate and later, where possible,\nto recommend and make initial contact with two further acquaintances (rather than close\nfriends) who met the project’s sampling criteria and who might be interested in being\ninterviewed. Those who agreed were then contacted by phone, were sent a background\nquestionnaire, and later were interviewed at a time and location of their choice. This\nprocedure was repeated until 40 men and 60 women were interviewed. Some 91% of those\nwho expressed initial interest in being interviewed and were contacted by the interviewer\nultimately took part in the study.\nCharacteristic of this sample was the naturally high level of education due to the\nselection criteria. Among men, 39 (98%) held a Bachelor’s degree or professional\nvocational qualification (e.g. primary or secondary school teaching certificate).\nFurthermore, 19 (48%) held a post-graduate degree. Twenty-five women (42%) held a\nBachelor’s degree or professional vocational qualification (e.g. primary or secondary school\nteaching certificate); ten of these women (17%) also held a post-graduate degree. At the\ntime of the interview, 38 men (95%) were employed full-time, with the remaining two men\n(5%) employed on a part-time basis (8–34 hours per week). For women at the time of\ninterview, 21 (35%) were employed full-time and 18 (30%) on a part-time basis. The\nremaining 21 women (35%) were full-time homemakers. Eighty-two participants (82%)\nwere in their first marriages; all but one (a Catholic priest) had been married. Ninety-three\nparticipants (93%) had at least one child.\nEvery effort was made to interview participants representing a variety of occupational\nchoices and life-style patterns (balances between paid employment and home demands).\nAmong men, however, only two participants were engaged in part-time work which had\nbeen undertaken following the children’s departure from home. Approximately equal\nnumbers of women employed outside the home had chosen the following balances between\npaid employment and homemaking: maintained full-time employment throughout\nadulthood, maintained part-time employment throughout adulthood, returned to full-time\nemployment following child-rearing, and returned to part-time employment following\nchild-rearing.\nMeasure\nMarcia’s Ego Identity Status Interview . The identity defining components of\noccupation, religion, politics, sex role values, and attitudes toward intimate relationships\nwere assessed from Marcia’s (1966) Ego Identity Status Interview and Waterman et al.’s\n(1979) and Whitbourne’s (1979) modification of the Identity Status Interview for use with\nadult subjects. For each of the five domains, participants were asked to describe attitudes\nheld at age 15 and then to trace developments in the relevant values during the intervening\nyears to the present. Individuals were classed as identity achieved, moratorium, foreclosure,\nor diffusion on each interview component for each chronological year of age from 15 years\nto the time of the interview.\n', '481Events and identity status change\nIn addition, participants were asked to describe what they regarded to be the primary\nsources of influence when identity status change seems to have occurred; these events were\nnoted at the time of the interview. The most important event associated with the identity\nstatus change was later coded into one of the following categories: (1) age-graded event\n(event generally experienced as a result of age-regulated societal requirements, e.g. leaving\nhigh school, first vote, becoming self-supporting and paying taxes, retirement); (2) history\ngraded event (an experience associated with an historical event or general historical ethos,\ne.g. the Great Depression, World War II, the Women’s Movement); (3) critical life event\n(a single event generally involving a major loss or setback and occuring at any point during\nthe life cycle, e.g. illness of self or important other, death, job loss, school failure, broken\nromance, major financial setback); (4) stage of the family life cycle (an event related to\nnormative family life cycle phases, e.g. marriage, becoming a parent, last child leaving\nhome, becoming a grandparent); (5) exposure to different cultural/social milieus/sources of\nknowledge (e.g. leaving the home-town for work or study in a different city, going overseas\nfor travel or study, exposure to different people, literature presenting alternative values); (6)\ndirect influence of significant other (not involving a critical life event or normative family\nlife cycle stage or issue, e.g. influence of parent, spouse, partner, analyst, close friend, child,\nmentor, teacher); (7) internal change (discontent or coming to terms with the self where\nthere was no strong external source of influence reported, e.g. altered perspective or new\nawareness through introspection); (8) no opportunity for desired goal (lack of opportunity\nwithin the present context to pursue vocational, ideological, sex role, or relationship\nvalues). These categories were derived from the subjects original descriptions of factors\nassociated with significant periods of transition or re-evaluation in their lives. While\nidentity status change may have resulted from a combination of these circumstances, only\nthe single most influential factor was coded according to the above scheme in conjunction\nwith identity status change. Only three instances of “no opportunity” were rated in\nconjunction with movement to identity diffusion (two in the vocational domain, one in the\ndomain of sex role values), so this event category was dropped from subsequent analyses.\nInterviews ranged from one and one-quarter to three and one-quarter hours in length.\nThey were facilitated by a preparatory questionnaire on “life transitions and marker events,”\nwhich participants had completed prior to their interview. This questionnaire requested\nparticipants to complete information on key circumstances which had played a major role\nin bringing them to the pursuits and values they held at present; these responses served as\nthe initial focus for the interview. All interviews were tape-recorded for later assessment.\nProcedure\nParticipants were interviewed over a 6-month interval by the first author. All interviews\nwere tape-recorded for later rating by one of four trained judges who were graduate students\nin education and psychology, also trained in listening and communication skills. Judges\nassigned each subject an identity status for each year of chronological age from age 15 years\nto the present within each of the five interview domains. Where identity status change\noccurred, the judge noted the most important factor which seemed to be primarily\nassociated with that change. The first 12 interview tapes were used for training purposes\nand discussed jointly. Each judge coded approximately one-quarter of the remaining tapes\nfor both ego identity status and type of event primarily associated with identity status\nchange.\n', '482 J. Kroger and K. E. Green\nInter-rater reliability was established through random selection for 22 participants (25%)\nof the remaining sample. These participants had their tapes rated independently by three\njudges for both identity status and event category associated with each identity status\nchange. Comparisons were first made of the identity status rating given to each participant\nfor each chronological year of age on each component. Based on the criterion for 2/3\nagreement among raters, the percentages of agreement for the five identity domains were as\nfollows: vocation=94%; religion=98%; politics=97%; sex role values=93%; relationships=\n93%. Where discrepancy occurred, the first author adjudicated. The probability of at least\n93% agreement between two raters is p<10−15 for test of random assignment.\nMajor demographic variables were coded as follows: age group (those experiencing the\nconclusion of World War II prior to age 15 years/at or after age 15 years); sex; education\nlevel (no post-secondary qualification/post-secondary qualification/post-graduate\nqualification); percentage of time in paid employment (full-time/part-time/no-time); age\nspan (15–24 years/25–34 years/35–44 years); life-style (employed full-time/part-time,\nthroughout adulthood/returned to full-time/part-time employment, following childrearing/no\nreturn to paid employment following child-rearing); marital status (first\nmarriage/other), parental status (at least one child/no children). Data were examined from\nage 15 to age 44 years for all participants, since sample size became considerably reduced\nfollowing age 44. Age spans were divided into the 10-year blocks on the basis of preliminary\nanalyses which found stability in the pace of identity status change within each of the\nabove 10-year time periods (Kroger and Haslett, 1987).\nResults\nType of life event associated with identity status change across identity\ndomains\nThe first question addressed in this study is whether or not there are differences in the types\nof events associated with identity status change across the different identity domains. Loglinear\nanalyses were used to examine the dependency of cell frequencies on identity status\nchange, identity domain, and event type. Cell frequencies for this analysis are based on the\nnumber of persons reporting at least one event of a particular type rather than the number\nof events per type. Results indicated that the best fitting model required all three two-way\nassociations, that is identity status change × domain, domain × event type, and event\ntype × identity status change. Results for each two-way association were as follows: identity\nstatus change × domain (LR2=106·09, df=12, p<0·00); domain × event type (LR2=206·07,\ndf=24, p<0·00); and event type × identity status change (LR2=349·35, df=18, p<0·00). The\nresult for the three-way association was not significant (LR2=59·06, df=72, p<0·86).\nSignificant associations among identity status change, identity domain, and event type must\nbe interpreted cautiously. Many cells had low or zero counts, making the results unstable.\nSuch analyses were undertaken, however, to clarify which event types were potentially\nsalient for particular identity domains and identity status changes.\nResults indicate that types of events associated with identity status change do not appear\nin equal frequencies across identity domains or identity status transitions. The presence of\nsignificant two-way associations means that in the identity status change × domain\nassociation, there is a difference in the frequency of particular identity status changes when\npaired with a particular identity domain; in the domain × event type association, there is a\n', '483Events and identity status change\n80\n0\nDomains\nN\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr \no\nf \np\ne\no\np\nle\n e\nx\np\ne\nri\ne\nn\nci\nn\ng\n a\nt \nle\na\nst\n \no\nn\ne\n s\nu\nch\n e\nv\ne\nn\nt\n60\n40\n20\nVocation Religion Politics Sex\nroles\nRelationships\nAge-graded\nHistory-graded\nCritical\nFamily cycle\nNew contexts\nInternal\nSignificant other\nFigure 1. Events associated with identity status change.\ndifference in the frequency of movement within particular domains when paired with a\nparticular event type; and in the event type × identity status change association, there is a\ndifference in the frequency of particular event types when paired with a particular identity\nstatus transition. For instance, in the identity status change × domain association, there is\nmore frequent movement into the diffusion status within the domain of religion, compared\nwith other identity domains. In the domain × event type association, “history-graded”\nevents appeared far more frequently in the sex role domain than other domains, and “agegraded”\nevents appeared far more frequently in the political domain compared with other\ndomains. In the event type × identity status change association, “influence of a significant\nother” was under-represented in movement into the diffusion status compared with other\nevent types.\nMore generally, “internal changes” contributed disproportionately to the total number of\nevents associated with identity status change across all identity domains. Some 47% of all\nevents associated with identity status change were rated “internal change” in the area of\npolitical values, 48% in the area of sex role values, 58% in the religious domain, 63% in the\narea of vocation, and 67% in the relationships domain. Since internal events were most\ncommonly linked with change into the moratorium and achievement identity statuses and\nthese two transitions occurred most frequently across domains, these findings will be\ndescribed more fully in the Results section. Figure 1 illustrates the frequency of life event\ntypes associated with identity status change across identity domains.\nAssociations among demographic variables, identity status change, and event\ntype within identity domains\nThe second question under consideration is whether or not there are significant\nassociations among identity status change, event type, and demographic variables within\neach of the five identity domains. Dependency of cell frequencies on event type, identity\nstatus change, and each of the demographic variables were examined within each identity\n', '484 J. Kroger and K. E. Green\ndomain again using log-linear analyses. Demographic variables were examined in their most\ndisaggregated form, since earlier work had indicated different identity status movement\npatterns to be associated with each subgrouping of all variables (Kroger and Haslett, 1987,\n1991). Cell frequencies for analyses were again based on the number of persons reporting at\nleast one event of a particular type rather than the number of events per event type.\nThe following partial Chi-square associations were significant at p<0·01: within\nvocation, identity status change × age span (LR2=22·21, df=6, p<0·002) and event\ntype × life-style (LR2=30·17, df=12, p<0·003); within religion, event type × age span (LR2=\n28·48, df=12, p<0·005); within politics, event type × age span (LR2=36·47, df=12, p<\n0·0004). Within relationships, the event type × age span association approached\nsignificance (LR2=25·47, df=12, p<0·02). Significant associations among demographic\nvariables, identity status change, and event type within each of the five identity domains\nmust again be interpreted cautiously. Many cells had low or zero counts, making the results\nunstable analyses and were undertaken for exploratory purposes only.\nNoteworthy among results was the finding that within all identity domains, there was a\nsignificant event type × identity status change partial Chi-square which was considerably\nlarger than the Chi-square value associated with the demographic variable under analysis;\nin other words, event type and identity status change were more strongly associated than\ndemographic variables and identity status change or demographic variables and event type.\nFor example, within the domain of vocation, the event type “influence of a significant\nother” was more strongly linked with movement into the foreclosure position than was the\ndemographic variable “age span”. Among demographic variables, the identity status\nchange × age span and event type × life-style associations were significant within the\ndomain of vocation; the event type × age span association was significant within religion,\npolitics, and approached significance within the relationships domain. Only the significant\nage span × event type associations will be described here, since this association occurred\nmost consistently within domains.\nThe majority of events linked with identity status change in both religious and political\ndomains came during the first (15–24 year) and third (35–44 year) age spans and involved\nexposure to new contexts and internal change processes. However, one further event type\nwas frequently associated with identity status change in the first age span within the\npolitical domain, where some 45% of all identity status changes were associated with “agegraded”\nevents in the 15–24 year age group. By contrast, no age-graded events appeared in\nother age spans of the political domain. Being able to exercise one’s first vote and having to\npay taxes on first earnings were common experiences linked to identity transitions within\nthe 15–24 year age span in the political domain.\nIn the second age span (25–34 years), internal events and family life cycle events were\nfrequently associated with identity status changes in the religious and relationship domains.\nIt was often when children were of an age to start Sunday school that many parents began\nto (re)examine their own religious beliefs. In the relationships domain, questions regarding\nthe meaning of intimacy often occurred in the 25–34 year age span, as children arrived and\nthe marital relationship required renegotiation.\nPreliminary analyses examining associations among identity domain, event type, and all\ndemographic variables across all identity domains produced only an event type × domain\neffect for all variables except sex, where there was an event type × sex effect. Women were\nfar more likely than men to experience an identity transition associated with stage of the\nfamily life cycle in all domains except religion. In the domain of vocation, one-third of all\n', '485Events and identity status change\nwomen had at least one identity status transition associated with stage of the family life\ncycle; by contrast, no men had family life cycle events associated with an identity status\ntransition within the vocational domain.\nEvents associated with specific identity status changes within identity domains\nA third and final question addressed in this study is what types of events are most\ncommonly associated with specific identity status changes (i.e. to achievement, to\nmoratorium, to foreclosure, to diffusion) within each of the five identity domains (vocation,\nreligion, politics, sex role values, relationships)? Findings are presented on a descriptive\nbasis. Table 1 indicates frequency of events associated with movement into each identity\nstatus.\nFor transition to the identity achievement status, events falling within the “internal\nchange” event category contributed disproportionately to the total number of events\nassociated with identity status change within each of the five identity domains. Within\noccupation, some 94% of all events associated with transition to the achievement status\nTable 1 Mean number of events associated with transition to each identity status within each\nidentity domain\nDomain Life event category\nAge History Family New Internal Significant\ngraded graded Critical cycle contexts change other\nn M n M n M n M n M n M n M\nTransition to identity achievement\nVocation 0 — 0 — 0 — 2 1·0 3 1·0 61 1·8 2 1·0\nReligion 0 — 0 — 2 1·0 3 1·0 1 1·0 34 1·3 3 1·0\nPolitics 5 1·0 0 — 0 — 3 1·0 2 1·0 38 1·0 1 1·0\nSex roles 0 — 3 1·0 0 — 3 1·0 1 1·0 53 1·1 7 1·1\nRelationships 0 — 0 — 0 — 3 1·0 0 — 51 1·2 7 1·0\nTransition to moratorium\nVocation 0 — 0 — 9 1·1 12 1·3 33 1·2 50 1·4 6 1·0\nReligion 0 — 0 — 1 1·0 8 1·0 19 1·0 28 1·1 5 1·0\nPolitics 1 1·0 12 1·0 0 — 1 1·0 22 1·0 22 1·0 2 1·0\nSex roles 0 — 23 1·0 2 1·5 9 1·1 14 1·0 18 1·1 8 1·1\nRelationships 0 — 2 1·0 10 1·0 7 1·0 7 1·0 37 1·1 10 1·0\nTransition to foreclosure\nVocation 1 1·0 4 1·0 2 1·0 7 1·1 1 1·0 12 1·1 14 1·0\nReligion 0 — 0 — 0 — 5 1·0 1 1·0 2 2·0 4 1·0\nPolitics 24 1·0 1 1·0 0 — 0 — 0 — 1 1·0 2 1·0\nSex roles 1 1·0 0 — 0 — 0 — 0 — 0 — 4 1·0\nRelationships 0 — 0 — 0 — 3 1·0 0 — 1 1·0 3 1·0\nTransition to diffusion\nVocation 1 1·0 0 — 2 1·0 2 1·0 4 1·0 5 1·0 0 —\nReligion 0 — 0 — 0 — 1 1·0 12 1·0 22 1·1 0 —\nPolitics 0 — 0 — 0 — 0 — 1 1·0 2 1·0 0 —\nSex roles 0 — 0 — 1 1·0 0 — 1 1·0 0 — 0 —\nRelationships 0 — 0 — 1 1·0 0 — 0 — 2 1·0 0 —\n', '486 J.

For other identity domains, percentages accounted for by the\n“internal change” event type were as follows: religion, 83%; politics, 78%; sex roles, 79%;\nand relationships, 85%. The predominant transition pathway to achievement was from\nmoratorium (Kroger and Haslett, 1991), and subjects most commonly reported a sense of\nfinding “contentment,” “peace of mind,” “congruence,” and/or “personal satisfaction” with\nnewly formed commitments in conjunction with transition to the achievement identity\nstatus.\nIt’s been an internal process, a gradual awareness of change in myself.

But now I’ve got my health, my own business, and my\nchildren—and we are all happy and enjoying life most of the time now (44-year-old female\nnaturopath, divorced with three children).\nWhat I’ve come to feel most over the past year is peace of mind. I’m more aware of myself and\nof everything in my life . . .. I now feel acceptance of and by the people around me, especially\nmy wife (55-year-old male writer, married with one child).\nTransition to the moratorium status appears to be associated primarily with either “exposure\nto new social or cultural environments” or “internal change” within each of the five\nidentity domains. “Internal change” accounted for about half of all transitions to the\nmoratorium status within domains of vocational, religious, and relationship values (50%,\n48%, 53%, respectively); “exposure to new social or cultural environments” was associated\nwith 28% of all transitions to moratorium in the area of vocation, 30% in the area of\nreligion, and 10% in the area of relationships. Within the political domain, “internal\nchange” tied with “exposure to new social/cultural contexts”, each accounting for 37% of\nall transitions to the moratorium status. Within the sex role domain, history graded events\n(most predominantly the rise of the Women’s Movement) accounted for 33% of all\nmoratorium transitions, followed by 29% of such transitions associated with “internal\nchange”. “Non-normative critical life” events (14%) and “influence of a significant other”\n(14%) were the two categories contributing the second highest frequencies of events\nassociated with identity status change within the relationships domain.\nThe predominant transition pathway to moratorium was from foreclosure (Kroger and\nHaslett, 1991), and within vocational, religious, and political domains, participants most\ncommonly reported discontent with previously held values and exposure to new contexts\non leaving home as responsible for (re)examining identity-defining decisions.\nI didn’t feel happy working in the family business, but wasn’t sufficiently unhappy to push\nmyself into anything else. [What brought that time to a close?] Dissatisfaction really. When I\nget dissatisfied, I tend to make a leap, and in that case the leap I made was to Europe, when I\nhad just turned eighteen. The move separated me from my family; I didn’t struggle with my\nfamily, so I had to get away in some other way. Inside of me the most important thing about\nthat change was that I stood on my own, found my own jobs, traveled on my own, thought\nabout what I wanted for the future . . . (43-year-old male accountant, married with two\nchildren).\nWithin the sex role domain, transition to moratorium was primarily associated with the\ninfluence of the Women’s Movement, although exposure to additional contexts and\ninternal experiences of dissatisfaction with previously held sex role values also occurred.\nWithin the relationships domain, internal changes, such as growing dissatisfaction with a\npartner or a changed level of awareness of one’s own needs or one’s own part in an intimate\nrelationship, were most commonly associated with transition to the moratorium status.\n', '487Events and identity status change\nI remember just sitting in a chair beside the fire that evening. My wife was reading in the chair\nopposite, the dog was by my feet—the whole scene. I’ll never forget that . . .. It was the first\ntime I really remember being aware that my wife and I were completely separate people . . . and\nhow different we were. I was really changed by that . . . (55-year-old male teacher, married with\nthree children).\nThe impact of critical life events such as loss of a partner through death or divorce, as well\nas the influence of a significant other (particularly a therapist or close friend) also were\nassociated with the transition to moratorium in the relationships domain.\nEvents associated with transition to the foreclosure identity status showed marked\ndifferences across identity domains. However, it must be noted that transition to the\nforeclosure status did not occur frequently within any identity domain. Most commonly,\nparticipants were rated as foreclosed at the outset of the study and identity status transitions\nbegan from this point. Where transition to foreclosure occurred, it was most commonly\nfrom the diffusion status, though there were also occasional movements from moratorium\nand achievement positions to the foreclosure status as well (Kroger and Haslett, 1991).\nWithin the vocational domain, the “influence of a significant other” ranked first in\naccounting for the largest frequency of events associated with the transition to foreclosure\n(39%), followed by the “internal change” (36%). Participants in transition to foreclosure\noften referred to a general discontent in drifting or a dissatisfaction with “not really going\nanywhere” in describing events associated with ultimately making a commitment. Within\nthe domain of religion, “stage of the family life cycle” events were most commonly\nassociated with transition to foreclosure (42%), followed by the influence of a significant\nother (33%).\nWhen my children started growing up, I really felt it was my duty to take them to church. I\nhadn’t given religion a thought for years, so I just picked up my mother’s religion and took the\nkids to church. I guess the children growing up brought me back to religion after all those years\n(47-year-old housewife, married, three children).\nWithin the political domain, “age-graded” events (86%) contributed most strongly to the\ntotal transitions to foreclosure. It was most commonly the need to make a first voting\ndecision or the impact of paying taxes that subjects reported to be associated with adopting\na stance on political and/or social issues—a stance based primarily on values they had\nadopted from significant others.\nWell, I think I started taking an interest in politics when I saw how much of my pay from my\nfirst teaching job was going into government coffers. I wanted at least to say how it should be\nspent, so I started voting and taking an interest in what Labour said . . . . My father supported\nLabour and said it was the best way for the ordinary person to get some results . . . (40 year-old\nmale teacher, one child).\nThere were few incidences of movement to the foreclosure status in the sex role and\nrelationships domains (n=5 and n=7, respectively); however, the “influence of a significant\nother” event category featured prominently in these transitions when they occurred (80%\nand 43% of all events, respectively).\nTransition to the diffusion status occurred infrequently within the domains of vocation\n(n=14), politics (n=3), sex role values (n=2), and relationship (n=3) domains; such\ntransition most often resulted from a significant loss or other critical life event.\nIt was when my husband and I came back to New Zealand after being in Europe that I went\nthrough a severe depression. I couldn’t continue with work and had to be hospitalized. There\nwas such a sense of freedom that I had in Europe, but now back here, I felt completely stifled\nand at sea (46-year-old female teacher, married with three children).\n', '488 J. Kroger and K. E. Green\nWithin the domain of religion, transition to diffusion from foreclosure and achievement,\nhowever, was not uncommon and increased its likelihood of occurrence with age (Kroger\nand Haslett, 1991). “Internal change” (most notably disillusionment with perceived\nhypocrisy in the church or a gradual waning of interest in religious or spiritual matters) as\nwell as “exposure to new social or cultural contexts” were events most commonly associated\nwith transition to the diffusion status, accounting, respectively, for 65% and 32% of all such\ntransitions.\nI had a fairly orthodox upbringing; I was brought up an Anglican and was a server. When I\nwent to university, though, I had less time, though I still sometimes went to church. But with\nmarriage, work, and then the family, I just left religion behind. Religion doesn’t have any\nmeaning for me now, though when we visit my parents, I sometimes take them to church (42year-old\nmale radiologist, married with two children).\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe present research was undertaken for the purpose of exploring the types of situational or\ncontextual variables associated with transition in the identity formation process from\nadolescence through middle adulthood. An understanding of the relationship of contextual\nvariables to the process of identity development remains largely unexamined in the research\non identity formation. While there has been some evidence from research in the social\npsychology literature that situational variables may set broad limits on probable behaviours,\npersonality variables largely explain individual responses within these broader limits (e.g.\nStewart, 1980; Flanagan, 1990). The question remains, however, whether or not certain\n“types” of events and/or situational contexts may nevertheless retain some commonalities in\ntheir ability to facilitate or deter identity development.\nGeneral findings from the present study indicate that the seven event types under\ninvestigation are differentially associated with various domains of identity development and\nidentity status transitions. Commitment to a political and sex role ideology, for example,\nappear strongly linked to age-graded and history-graded demands of the larger social\ncontext, respectively, while the adoption of values important in an intimate relationship is\nstrongly linked with the influence of a significant other. Societal expectations and/or\nsupports for certain types of identity-defining commitments may be primarily responsible for\nsome identity status transitions, particularly in earlier age spans where movement is into or\nfrom the foreclosure identity status.\nHowever, one of the most important findings to emerge from this study is the strong role\nthat internal change processes play in transitions to all identity statuses within all identity\ndomains. Changes in perspective or important new awareness, without clear links to\nexternal presses, are associated with one-half to two-thirds of all identity status changes\nacross domains. In her 20-year follow-up of women first interviewed during their senior year\nin college, Josselson (personal communication, 13 July 1995) similarly reports that major\nrevisions of identity are primarily associated with internal change processes, including new\nways of thinking about the self and others and new realizations and recognitions. Such\ninternal changes may later propel individuals into new external contexts and/or forms of\nrelatedness with others, but the impetus for change, at least for participants of the present\ninvestigation and that of Josselson, has rested initially with internal processes. Such\nprocesses have included a greater sense of openness to experience, dissatisfaction or\n', '489Events and identity status change\ndisillusionment with present circumstances, and the desire to reintegrate into mid-adult life\nearlier identity elements that had been left behind.\nThe present research has also demonstrated that within all identity domains, event type\nand identity status change are more strongly associated than are demographic variables and\nidentity status change or demographic variables and event type. While the actual\nfrequencies and durations of various identity status transitions have shown great variation\naccording to choice of life-style (i.e. the balance chosen between family and the percentage\nof time in paid employment throughout adulthood, Kroger and Haslett, 1987, 1991), the\ntypes of events actually associated with such identity status transitions do not appear to\ndiffer. Thus, within all identity domains, major demographic variables such as sex, age\ngroup, education level, marital and parental status, time in paid employment, and work\npattern appear to be associated only weakly, if at all, to various identity status transitions\nwhen compared with the impact of such major life events as internal change processes or\nexposure to new contexts.\nTaken together, these findings provide support for the notion that while social\ncircumstance may set broad limits on probable behaviours, individual personality variables\nplay a key role in predicting one’s course of identity development during the young and\nmiddle adulthood years (Stewart, 1980; Grotevant, 1987). Factors such as one’s degree of\nopenness to experience, ego resilience, self-esteem, and cognitive complexity may serve to\nmediate external presses in the identity formation process (Grotevant, 1987; Tesch and\nCameron, 1987; Marcia et al., 1993; Berzonsky and Kinney, 1994). Even Erikson (1959) has\nnoted how different individuals use different contextual opportunities in the process of\npersonal identity development. Major identity revisions beyond adolescence may occur less\nfrequently as a direct response to contextual events or demands and more in association\nwith internal change processes.\nThe relationship between contextual or situational variables and the identity formation\nprocess remains complex. The present study provides a beginning toward identifying some\nof the events primarily associated with identity status change within each identity domain\nfor a sample of mid-life New Zealand adults. Future research might fruitfully detail the ways\nin which contextual variables may interact both with one another as well as with individual\npersonality variables to determine the course of the identity formation process. Greater\nattention to the “mutual complementation of ethos and ego, of group identity and ego\nidentity” can only enrich our understandings of both ego synthesis and social organization.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research assistance of Rita Chung, Gillian Fleming, Nerys Parry, and Beverly Rhodes is\ngratefully acknowledged.
