MONROE 353\nybl. 1, No. 267 Chicago, Saturday, Aug. 3, 1912 One Cent\nNEW YORK HAS BECOME WORLD\'S GAMBLING CAPITAL\nNew York, Aug. 3. New York\nis the new gambling center of the\nworld. "\nThis is the humiliating and in\ndisputable -\'fact, which America\nhas now got to face that New\nYork, the pride of our great na\ntion, has come to be in a class\nwith Monte Carlo, with Paris,\nand with other ill-reputed Euro\npean gaming resorts has, in\nfact, outstripped foreign cities in\nthe number and size of the houses\nof chance within her gates.\nThe day has passed when the\nmetropolis of the United States\ncould lay claim to being morally\nclean. This fact seems to have\nbeen only too evident, by the re\nsults of Dist. Atty. Whitman\'s in\nvestigation into the murder of\ngambler Herman Rosenthal. For\nthese results show, if the triple\nconfession of Jack Rose, Harry\nVallon and Bridgey Webber is to\nbe believed, that the proprietors\nof Manhattan\'s gambling houses\npay out each year in graft almost\n$5,000,000 in order to be "pro\ntected" by the "system."\nAnd the question instantly\narises, \'if dealers in chance can\nafford to pay out such a tremend\nous sum of money in. graft, how\nmuch must they, take in from\ntheir victims?.\nThere are various answers to\nthis being made in New York to\nday. But whatever this sum to\ntal is, be it one or two hundred\nmillions a year and it may be as\nmuch as that it is certainly so\ngreat that the jackpots of Monte\nCarlo and its allies dwindle to\nfoolish little piles beside it, and\nplace New York in the very cen\nter of the world\'s gambling map.\nThe gambling palaces and dives\nof New York are scattered. They\nstretch from the very doors of\nproud, aristocratic Fifth avenue\ndown to the East and West sjdes\nof the island where the wharf\nrats run. But most of them are\ngrouped about Longacre Square,\nthe famous center of the white\nlight district at Broadway and\n42d street.\nA majority of them are but a\nstone\'s throw from the Metro\npole hotej, where Herman Rosen\nthal was shot to the death by the\noccupants of the drab gray mur\nder car.\nMost of these garnbling dens\nhave a middle class look of respec\ntability about them, not too or\nnate nor too plain. They are\nhoused in the unobtrusive browu\nstone fronts which, "society" li\nUJto-4tfMtoikfe- rfa.Ufr, ?\n?', ': titywMKgH \'-\' ih.iww.ui1 MmitpimLwmfmmmM\nJP\'n&fliB\ned in 30 years ago, but which "so\nciety" has now given up fon mar\nble palaces overhanging the park.\nThere are places, however, which\nmight be easily taken for the\nabodes of steel trust magnates, so\nimpressive are their carved and\nuted entrances; and there are,\n3\n&EZS5.\n1-varjh.B\nHerman Rosenthal\'s Brownstone\nFront "Palace of Chance"\non Forty-fifth St.\nagain, little shacks that would be\npassed by as "sweat shops."\nBefore ex-Dist. Atty. Jerome\ncrusaded 1 against gambling in\nNew York a few years ago, there\nwere 10 gaming houses that were\nconsidered the leading ones of\nthe city. They were most elab-\n1 orate, and the amount of money\nthat passed hands in them -every\nevening in the year was almost\nbeyond belief. Some of them\nhave gone now, arid others have\nchanged their locations, but prob\nably most of them or their suc\ncessors are still plying trade\nsomewhere about the city.\nThe old houses, famous the\nworld over, wefe: Richard A.\nCanfield\'s in East 44th street;\nWilliam T. Burbridge\'s in W.\n33d street; John T. Kelly\'s in W.\n41st street; Charles Reed\'s in W.\n24th street; John Daly\'s in W.\n29th street; Sol Lichenstein\'s in\nW? 31st street; Tim Kenny\'s in.-\nW. 38th street; LoU Ludlum\'s in\nW. 40th street; Shang Draper\'s\nin W. 28th street, "The" Allen\'s\nin W. 34th street.\nCanfield\'s was the most famous\nof all New York\'s gaming palaces.\nIts appointments were most elab\norate, though no more so than\nthose of "The" Allen\'s place,\nwhich is said to have contained a\nroom done in carved marble and\ncosting $50,000.\nAnd who, you ask, came to\nthese houses, that they must be\nkept up in such exquisite style?\nWell, one man, for instance,\nwho used to frequent them was\nJohn W. Gates, A fiancier who\nhad Pierpont Morgan, August\nBelmont and all of Wall street\nworried to death at one time.\nGates at a single sitting in Can\nfield\'s lost $110,000, and this, it\nis said, was not unparalleled.\nIt was at Canfield\'s, too, that\nReginald Vanderbilt and a party\nof friends made their fa"mous play;\nVjitttffri\'BfWWiijfafrfr iiyg-iiift iiimii ,mm\n1', 'mljih wyuw wu" \'Jtfn pppwiMifwp\nwajBPfJVJ-J11\nm\nip\nlate one night. Lawrence Water\nbury and Payne Whitney are said\nto have been among the number\nthere. One of the men lost that\nevening nearly $80,000. That loss\nhas been credited to young Van\nderbilt.\nDo the men who frequent thesr\nplaces get a square deal? -Those\noh the inside say they do not, that\nthere is -not a single gambling\nden in New York where things\nare played straight. Where faro\nis played, and most of the big\nhouses play faro and roulette\nonly, there are generally a couple\nof brace faro dealers, men so\nadept in their line that they can\nfool the shrewdest of professional\ngamblers and men who do no\nwKrk. for $\'10 or $20 a night, but\ndemand and receiv.e 55 per cent\nof their victims\' losses, the house\nbeing content with but 45 per\ncent.\nThis percentage irf itself shows\nwhat chance the player "has of\n.winning. .Practically every gam-\'\nbling house has these "steere.rs,"\nand if games were, run honestly\nno gambling house could exjst\nand pay its steerers 55 per cent of\nthe winnings. In "honestly dealt"\nfaro the percentage is only abouS\n3 per cent in favor of the house,\nand on roulette but between 6 and\n7 per cent.\no o\n"WANTED" MAN CAUGHT\nA man known as Harry Brown,\nlleged by "the police to have sev\neral aliases, was arrested, today\ntfter a desperate chase through\nJowntoyn streets. He is being\nheld on a charge of forgery, his\nspoils said to be $11,000.\nIt is\' alleged that ail of .the\nchecks were drawn against the\naccount of Mrs. Ella Wilson,\nwidow of E. Crane Wilson, who\nowned furnishing stores in sev-t\neral cities of this country and Eu\nrope. Mrs. Wilson is traveling in\nJapan.\nBrown was arrested by \'private\ndetectives in the Chamber of\nCommerce building. He broke\naway and was pursued and\ncaught by mounted patrolmen.\no o\'\n"I call \'em the cutlery family."\n"Why so?"\n"Well, the daughter spoons,\nthe father forks out the money,\nand the mother knives the other\nguests."\nWHAT HAPPENED IN CHICAGO\nState Progressive convention\nto nominate state- ticket and. na\ntional delegates was called to or\nder by tMedijl McCormick at\nlkl8.\n\' Immediately after prayer, flags\nin the fear of the hall were drawn\nback and an electrically lighted\nportrait of Roosevelt disclosed.\nDelegates"shouted their enthus\niasm wildly for 10 minutes.\nCharles E. Merriam was intro\nduced as temporary chairman,\nand made keynote speech.\nMerriam said that the object of\nthe third party was to give back\nto the people the government that\nhad been stolen from thenfby the\nbosses.\nrot-', 'in J"Ti\nWhen Merriam mentianed\nTift\'s name it was greeted by\ngroans and hoots. Here"ar e a few\nof the significant things In l.Ier\nriam\'s speech:\n"I believe we must stand for a\nminimum wage for women;, a lim\nitation of the hours of labor in\ncontinuous industries."\n"I believe we must appoint an\nindustrial commission to investi\ngate the hours, conditions and\nwdges of labor in Illinois, must\nstrengthen our labor laws and get\nnew legislation dealing with this\nhuman problem."\nMerrlam also came out flatly\nfor votes for women.\nThere was no doubt from the\nbeginning that the true progres\nsives were in control of the con\nvention. Robert Eaton, who wanted\nnomination for governor, and his\nfriends, tried to block the pro\ngram, but they were not success\nful, It Is certain that Frank H,\nFunk of BJoomington Will be\nnominated as Progressive candi\ndate for governor of Illinois.\nMeeting of Progressive editors,\nscheduled for today, was postpone\ned until tomorrow because Editor\nE. A. Van Valkenburg, of Phil\nadelphia, could not be here.\nVote of the 14,000 street car\nmen of Chicago was almost unan\nimously in favor of a strike.\nIt is up to the Chicago Railway\nCo. and- the Chicago City Rail\nways Co. now.\nIf these two companies, which\npay immense dividends, refuseto\ngrant thein.employes a decent liv-\nj ing wage, there will be a strike\n"And It will be one of the great\nest city railway strikes.that ever\nhas occurred.\nBy the joint agreement, the\nElevated trainmen will walk out\nwith the surface car men.\nThis will be the first time that\nElevated and surface car men\nhave acted together in any Amer\nican city.\n, It will mean that every trans\nportation line ih Chicago Will be\ncompletely tied up.\nThe companies still have plenty ,\nof time to grant the reasonable\ndemands of the men.\nThe men do not want a strike\n\'A strike means too much suffer\ning for themselves and too much\nsuffering for their wives and chil\ndren. But they are desperate. How\ncan they be otherwise when their\nweekly wage is only $127. HdW\ncan men support families on that?\nThe men will give the torn-\npanies until Aug. 10 to think it\nover. If then they still refuse a\nwage increase there Will undoubt\nedly be a strike.\nfiid you come through for a\ntag, or did you dodge?\nWm.

Other cities that looked after\nthe interests of the people who\nride on the cars, didn\'t take a per\ncentage of the profits- they got\n3-cent fares for the people, and\nfairly decent wages for the em\nployes. And the city of Chicago is as\nmuch to blame now as are the\nowners of watered bonds and"\nstocks in the company, because\nthe street railway employes don\'t\nget wages enough to raise fami\nlies. One trouble is that the poli\nticians in office represent big busi\nness more than they represent the\npeople. s\nIf they had really represented\nthe people, Chicago might have\nbeen the first city in the country\nto own its own street railway\nsystem.\nAustralian orphans become\nwaids of the state, receive allow\nances for support, are placed in\nprivate families, and are fed and\nclothed till their fourteenth birthday.\n-V\nv, jiiStuatitfti. w-. ..tam-i\nv4& 4; j ?uw ttat\'', '1 " -V UV"VP\nr BA5EBALLD0PE\nStanding of the Clubs\nAmerican League.

Through\nthe killing of Herman Rosenthal,\ngambler and reprobate, by .hired\nassassins, the attention of the\ncountry has been drawn to the\nease and deftness with which a\nman may be put out of the way\nby his enemies in the nation\'s me\ntropolis. In the Rosenthal case the es\ncape of the murderers has been\nlaid to indifference, due to an al\nleged alliance between members\nof the police department and -the\ngambling interests.\nIt may be thought, .outside of\nNew York, that such a bold crime\nas the killing of Herman Rosen\nthal must be exceptional in New\nYork,and that only through some\nunusual reason-could the perpe\ntrators of such an assassination\nget away so easily. \'\n, Not at all. The Rosenthal slay\ning\' had is peculiar features, but\nit was only one of a constant suc\ncession of midnight assassina\ntions which mark" the contempt\nfor human life"1 prevalent in this\ncity\'s,dark underworld;\nOn\' the night Rosenthal Was\nmurdered two men sat playing\ncheckers in a barber shop at 261\nE. 10th st. Two men entered and\none of them said to one of the\nchecker players: "Are you Roc\nco?" "Yes," he replied.\nEight shots were fired into\nRocco\'s body, and the two walked\nout, leaving their victim dead on\nthe floor.\nThat they were hired to .kill ;\nthat they did not even know per\nsonally the man they murdered,\nwas shown by their having to ask\nhim his name before they killed\nhim. They have not been caught.\nOn the next evening, less than\n24 hours after Rosenthal was\nkilled, a man was walking along\nthe sidewalk near .Second av. and\n108th st. when several others\ncame up to him and put ten bul\nlets into his body.\nHe was dead when the police\npicked him up, and. none of his\nslayers was caught.\nThe Rosenthal case is getting\nmuch publicity,\' but the papers\nscarcely mentioned the. other two\nkillings.

Crowell.\nProfessor Draper, intent upon\nthe bubbling mixture within the\nretort before him, nodded slight\nly as the maid entered and depos\nited a packet of mail upon his\ndesk. For weeks he had been\npondering the mystery contained\nwithin the mass, and he congrat\nulated himself that at last there\nwere telltale signs visible to his\npracticed eye which promised an\nearly and satisfying solution.\nPresently he slipped the spirit\nlamp from his position and lean\ned back to watch the cooling of\nthe compound.\nBy accident his eye fell upon\nthe letters at his elbow, and after\nan idle glance of curiosity at the\ntopmost he suddenly started for\nward and seized it excitedly.\n"Tom!" he ejaculated in sur\nprise. "Who dares to address me\nin that manner?"\nWith a hasty motion he tore\nopen the envelope and withdrew a\nsecond, unsealed.\n"Ah!" was his puzzled excla\nmation. "Some one married,\neh?"\nThe professor glanced quickly\nat the retort and then settled back\nwith a sigh to peruse the missive.\n"Well, well! Nell\'s married at\nlast! And to old George, too!\nWell, my congratulations, old\nman Nell was the prettiest girl\nin the clas, anyway!"\nHe leaned forward and studied\na vacant spot on the table. Then\nhe reached over and drew out a\ndrawer in a desk near by, ab\nstracting therefrom a bundle of\nletters tied together by. a pink\nribbon. He fumbled them over\nthoughtfully.\n"Yes," said he at length. "It is\nas I thought! The whole class\nhas married that is, excepting\nTom.\'; t\nHe arose and stepped before a\nmirror, stroking his dark beard\nmusingly.\n"Tom, you lonely old canine\ndissector, will you ever marry?"\nhe asked the face in the glass.\nThe professor started.\n"I forgot Mollie Kenton entire-\n.ly! But of course she is married.\nWhy, it s been ten years, ana\nMollie well, I was just a shacjev\nsweet on her myself at one time!"\nWith a gesture of impatience\nat his momentary weakness the\nprofessor pushed the letters asiae\nand bent over the slowly cooling\nmass in the retort. It was too\nlate now, he told himself, to har\nbor such distracting thoughts as\nthis letter called up.\nTen minutes later, however,\nhe caught himself whispering to\na row of test tubes in a rack\nalongside the wall:\n"I wonder who Mollie mar\nried!" Recollecting himself, lie attack\ned test anew, and an hour there\nafter was diligently engaged with\nhis calculations.\nA week later the professor was\ntrying to believe that he Had en\ntirely forgotten the incident. He\nwas working long hours at his\nmultiplying duties m an effort to\nfully occupy his mind.

The preceding number had\nceased and the thunders of ap\nplause that greet young grad\nuates on such occasions as this\nwere dying slowly away.\nIn the lull that followed a form\nstepped quickly outr from the\nmystifying background and glid\ned down to the center of the\nstage. Professor faper sat up\nstraight and surveyed the figure\nwith unconcealed intensity. \'Af\nter a moment he sank back with\nA weary; air that was cerjtairily\nhot his Mollie kenton I His Mem\nory of her was of A far slimmer,\nmore auburn-haired creature\nthis perfectly proportioned wo\nman no, it could not be Mollie\nKenton.\nIdly he listened to the stirring\nwordB of the speaker, his eyes oc\ncasionally pausing in their Wan\ndering to rest on her fair throat,\nher queenly head or a rounded\nshoulder. Ik felt a strange lack\nof interest now, and his disap\npointment was bringing him to a\nrealization of the folly of making\nthe unwarranted journey.\nIn thejnidst of his thoughts\nthe speaker ended and drifted\nlightly away to the plaudits of\nthe. assemblage.\n"Mollie grows younger every)\nday 1" remarked some oHe near by\nThe professor opened his eyes\nquickly and glanced about He\ntapped his neighbor lightly on the\narm.\n"Who was that last speaker?"\nhe inquired. "\n"That\'s Mollie Kenton! D6h\'t\nyou know her?"\nHis informant Spoke in a tone\nof surprise and Professor Draper\nleaned limply back in hid seat\nWas that really Mollie? there\nWas something of the miraculous\nin this thing, and In an endeivor\nto account for it on scientific\ngrounds he became calmer. He\nfolded his arms andfixed hhveyes\nStraight ahead. He was aroused\npresently hy his neighbor\'s ris\ning and edging out into the aisle\nUnthinkingly he, too, rose and\nforced a Way down to the rear of\nthe hall. He glanced at hte\n\' i-ti i $ t nil- iafriiitiT8flr\'iirtfi1if -\nmiTr nn miti una iirr \'"Utt r', 'mmmmsm\nwatch it was eleven o\'clock.\nThe program must be well nigh\nended.\nWith a feeling of loneliness he\nleft the hall and stood bareheaded\nin the calm June night. From the\nstage entrance a light shone, and\nas the professor caught sight of\nit his bosom swelled with recol\nlections of ither times when he\nhad watched that same stage door\nwith palpitating heart and heav\ning breast.\nAnd then, as he looked, a\nshadow thrust forward, followed\nalmost instantly by a form. He\nknew her now that telltale\nsweep of the hands as they gath\nered the straying locks and patted\nthem deftly to place. Before he\nrealized it he was stepping up to\nward the light. In a moment he\nstood at a point so near that an-\nother step would reveal his pres\nence. Breathlessly he stood and\nstudied the girl it was the same\nMollie Kenton!\nHe stepped forward into the\npath of light. The girl turned a\nstartled face toward! him as he\ncame up the walk.\n"Why, it\'s Tom ! Tommy Dra\nper!" The girl reached out quick\nly and grasped his hand.\n"Oh, it IS Tom!" she repeated,\nwhile the professor flushed to his\nhair and struggled to peak.\n"Yes, it\'s Tom," he said. "And\nyou xlon\'t mean to say that you\nare the same old Mollie Kenton?"\n"The same only a trifle\nolder."\nShe pushed him out at arm\'s\nlength and surveyed him critic\nlly-\naMy ! Bat are you really such?\na tremendous professor as those\nlooks would indicate? You are\nso so studious looking, Tom!"\n"I ah I am a trifle studious,\nI presume," he admitted.\n"I can. remember when you\nIsn\'t it a lovely night? Is that\nan owl hooting, Tom?"\n"Some one blowing a horn, I\njudge," said the professor.\nShe glanced at him with a faint\nsmile.\n"And it IS a fine evening!" he\nadded, apologetically.\n"I\'ll get my things, Tom, and\nyou can take me home. I was go\ning with Stella Tilton, but she has"\nNed Edgely to fall back on and\nwon\'t b,e disappointed."\nShe whisked out of sight, leav\ning the professor dazed at the\nsuddenness of it all. It was just\nlike the old times. The same\nmoon, the same restful quiet, the \'\nsame springtly care-free Mollie\nall was as it should be except\nhimself. He seemed so much\nmore advanced older and more\norderly.\nIn a moment the girl came out\nand seized his arm with an air of\nproprietorship that made him\nwince, but switched him wholly\nback to those othef days.\nThe walk home was, strangely\nlong. At times the moon oppor\ntunely lurked in the protecting\nlee\'of intervening clouds.

And when the Astor\nheir or heiress arrives, the num\nber of nurses will be increased to\nseven.\nJust what seven trained nurses\nare" going to do with one baby, we\ncan\'t even guess. Mebbe some of\n\'era are for the baby, some for the\nmother, and a few for the doctor\nhimself.\nAndvthey say, too, that the au-\ntomobile traffic on Fifth avenue is\nbeing turned aside so the noise\nwon\'t be heard by the doctbrs,\nnurses and the rest of the bunch.\nThe autos are to get off Fifth\navenue north of the Astor Jibme\nand pass down Madison avenue.\nThey say Mrs. Astor hopes for\na son, but latest reports from New\nYork indicate that al the Astor\nmillions, the highest-priced baby\ndoctor in New York and the\nseven trained nurses, has as yet\nfound no way to arrange this lit\ntle matter in\' advance to please\nMrs. Astor.\nWhen plain, ordinary people\nread all\'the slush about the com\ning millionaire baby, who is very\napt to turn out to be a society\nslob- after all, their minds are\nvery apt to run back to the time\nwhen a child was born in a\nmanger and became the savior\nof mankind.\nBut wjth the Astor baby, it is\nmoney that makes all the differ\nence.

That the\npolice department is completely\nbaffled in its search for two miss\ning murderers of Herman Rosen\nthal was plainly indicated by a\nstatement from the district attor\nney\'s office this afternoon.\nIt was admitted that Louis\nSpiegel, counsel for two of the\nmen under arrest, has been nego\ntiating with the district attorney\nfor the surrender of the fugitives,\nwho have agreed to give them\nselves up in return for immunity.\nWhile the police are searching\nthe Catskill mountains, it is be\nlieved the men are secreted in\nsome resort in this city. Unless\nthey are found by Monday, Dis\ntrict Attorney Whitman will\nprobably agree to their terms.\nFrank Moss, assistant district\nattorney, and who has acted for\nreform organizations, may be put\nin charge of the graft probe.

Shattering the,\nsuperstitious belief, in which he\nhimself shared, that he would not\nlive\' to celebrate the ninth anni\nversary of his elevation to the\nVatican throne, Pius X. today\ncompleted the ninth year of his\npontificate.\nThe odd superstition that he\n.would die before today was based\non the manner in which his holi\nness\' entire life has been divided\ninto nine-year, periods. As plain\nGiuseppe Sarto he was ordained a\npriest in 1858, and served as a\ncurate for nine years. Then fol\nlowed his \'promotion to the post\nof parish priest at Salzano, where\nhe remained nine years more."\nNext came nine years as chancel\nlor of his diocese, nine as bishop\nof Tantua apd nine as cardinal\nand patriarch of Venice.\n.

L Who was murdered\nlast night, as a hero.\nThey praise him now that he is\ndead, and tell hoW he died heroic\nally, protecting his employer\'s\nmoney.\nBut it would be interesting to\nknow what wages the dead hero\ngot from his employer while he\nwas alive.\nJudging by what the compan\nies pay other employes, the\nchances are that the poor old hero\nbarely got enough to keep body\nand soul of himself and wife to\ngether. And verv likelv .the accd\nwidow of the aged hero Will gel\nnothing mor.e substantial fpr the\nloss of her husband than these\nnice notices about him in \'the\npapers.\nSome of these poor but precious\nlives might be saved if so rrfany\npolicemen were on duty protect\ning human life instead of work\ning for millionaire- newspaper\nowners.\n- "You say you\'ve kissed every\nwoman you\'ve known Vi\n"Yee."\n"How do you mah&ge it?"\n"I telf them I am wntinga book\non \'Then Thousand Varieties of\nKisses.\' I give each a number.and\ntell her to look for the description\nof her kiss when the book is pub\nlished.
