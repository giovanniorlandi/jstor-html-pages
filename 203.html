By that date construction on, the spur to the mines will be started., An earlier start would be impossible, because of the presence of frost in the, ground., "While East I closed a contract for, the supplying of 600 tons of 45-pound, steel rails for the extension. These, rails will reach the coast this mootb, for shipment north. Another rail order, will follow later. The cmpany his, bought two 110-ton locouotkes to be, used in pushing the ore train over the, summit, and we will require some fifty I, cars, which will either be built in the, north or on the outside. We bare just, placed an order for ties and lumber, with local sawmills, and shipment of, this material will soon be undertaken.", Mr. Berdoe will remaia in Vancouver, otT and on for a month or so, and it is, nnlikely that he will come north to, spend the summer befor; May 15th., AUTOS HAVE CROSSED NEW YORK, (United PreM Telegraph-Cable Service.), Buffalo, N.

Hoggatt has gone into it with all the, strength at his command. Cale is working as though some, thing more than his life depended upon it. Cale says it is, a question whether the representative of the people is to be, allowed to represent them or whether the right of repre, sentation was accorded to Alaska merely as a matter of, form. Ilcggatt still insists that the appointments of Cale, are not fit men for the places, So presistent are both men, and so many conflicting telegrams arrive daily from the, friends of both men that the president confesses himself, unable to decide the question at such loug range and so, intimates an intention of sending a special representative, to the respective places to get the sentiment of the people, most concerned, as was done in the case of Governor, Brady, Judge WickershaiL and cases at Nome., THE FLOOD AT PITTSBURG, (By United Press.), 1\'ittsburg, Feb. 17. ?

All th3 streets inter, sec) ing two blocks back from Duquesne, Way, the front along the Allegheny, river, are flooded two miles out from, the Point, at the meeting of the two, rivers.

I took, ^her to a doctor, who said it was, eczema. He gave me medicine to, give her, but she kept getting worse, all the time. Her little face and body, were so covered with sores and large, scales you could not tell what she, looked like. No child ever had a, worse case. Her face was being eaten, away, and even licr finger hails fell, off. Then it itched so she could not, sleep, and for many weary nights we, could get no rest. At last we got, Cuticura Soap and Ointment, first, bathing her in warm water with the, Soap, and then spreading on the Oint, ment with soft cloths. I saw a change, in a week. The sores began to heal,, and she could sleep at night, and in, one month she had not one sore on, her face or body.

J.,, Aug. 14, 1904.", The foregoing statement justifies, the oft-repeated assertion that Cuti, cura Soap and Ointment afford instant, relief, and permit sleep for baby and, rest for tired mothers, and points to, a speedy, permanent, and economical, cure, when all else fails, in the mosft, torturing, disfiguring, itching, burn, ing, bleeding, scaly, crusted, and, pimply skin, and scalp humors., Cuticura 8oap, Ointment, and Pill* arc told fhrouffhout, the world, Potter lirug&Cheni.

Wlldpr she, was arrested by a Boston department, store detective on the. charge o / Inr, ceny. With her was her cbuin,, Blanche Dunn, who also was arrested, It was a most dramatic moment for, the two pretty vest end girls, who, were defying with (lashing eyes tho, charges of the store detective. It was, nbout the\' momehfwhon the girls seem, ed to bo winning their point that the, niai\'ii. clock went on its wild telltale, ra*vfie, and tho girls were arrested., A Poor Prophet., Conan Doyle told of an experience, which he had when leaving school., His teacher must have been one of, thoso noble old Romans such as Thack, eray describes as roaring nt young, Pendennls when the major, his uncle,, called to take the boy away. When, Conan Doyle had finished his course in, school the bead muster called him aside, and, after eying him with ominous dis, favor, spoke to him in measured tones, as follows: "Doylo, I have known you, now for seven years, and i know you, thoroughly. 1 am going to say some, thing which you will remember In aft, er life.

A vegeta, ble resembling cabbage Is sometimes, Iried in the sun without salt and put, iway in shallow baskets until ready, for use. They have a way also of mak, ing a kind of .sauerkraut very much as, Americans do. The treatment of cer, alu vegetables In this way is a, com, uou practice. The best native hams, :ome from a reglou known as the Kin, ma district. In Cheklang province. The, lams when pressed and ready for cur, ? fng :>:v . \' -m( in vats. A, kjiul of pickle-Is th<rn prepared of salt,, water and :i aft tic? from the Hoy bean,, ? which is poured over the fresh hams., After tlio hams have been in the plekle, n sufficient length of tlmo tJioy are tnk, : en oul and huug up to dry and occa, sionally, -but not often, smoked, when, they are ready for the market. Some, times a little nitrate of potash Is also, added to help preserve them, but thL\'i, addition Is the exception and not the, rule. It Js.ropotcd that In the south, hams are cured by means of an alkaline, earth and common salt, but so far as, cau be learned no earth of any kind Is, employed* In the middle nnd northern, provinces. The famous picked eggs, of China are preserved with\' a pickle, made of common mud, salt, saltpeter, and soy bean sntice, all mixed together., The |Cggn r re coated with a plaster of, this mixture and laid away until ripe,, when they are ready for the table., rr<amred lu (his way they will keep, several months." J, \'joking in korea., Hermit Kingdom Supplies Best to, ? ? CMna and Japan., it b not 7<\'nei:.illy known that the, best h;nd< ?.f paper met with in China, anu Japan ::re the product of Korea., It is claimed by* many that the Korean, paper excels the very best that Is made, lu China and Japan. It Is produced, entirely by-manuni labor and without, the use of any machinery. The raw, material "used for (he better kinds la, obtained from the barly of the Prous, sonetiu papyrifera, which is collected, lu the spring and beateu In water con, taining a large admixture of wood, ashes until reduced to a thick pulp., This Is taken In large ladles and, spread upou frames of bamboo so as, to form thin sheets. Another kind of, paper Is made from old scraps trodden, Into pulp, much in the same way that, grape Juice Is extracted In some coun, tries, and, though this mode of pulp, ing is slow, it lias the advantage of not, breaking the fiber so much as when, machinery Is used., After the pulp has been made Into, paper the sheets are plied up to a, height of six feet and then cut Into, pieces, to be again subjected to the, stamplhg w\'ith the feet. At the same, time the roots and seeds of a plant, called tackpoul are added, the soluble, parts of which are supposed to give, tenacity nnd fws\'jnfsn to the paper.?, PvMwn-r., w, Headquarters for Mining a/ul Commercial Men, SIKICTLY FIRST-CLASS, Pack train Saloon, SHEA St PATTEN, PROPS., Broadway and titn Avenue, SJcaffway, Alaska,, x, ^GORE\'S WHHRF CO., Terminus W.
