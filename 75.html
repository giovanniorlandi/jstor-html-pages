C, Mar. 2. The\nexpected clash between Gifford Pin\nchot and Secretary of Agriculture\nWilson over the disputed questions as\nto whether or not the secretary had\ngiven the former forester permission\nto write to Senator Dolliver the letter\nwhich resulted In Mr. Pinchot\'s dis\nmissal, came Tuesday before the Bal-Hnger-Pinchot\nInvestigating commit\ntee. Mr. Pinchot declared he had discus\nsed the matter at length with Secre\ntary Wilson, and that he understood\nhis superior officer had given him ex\npress permission to write to Senator\nDolliver.\nSecretary Wilson immediately took\nthe stand and asserted that while he\nhad given Mr. Pinchot permission to\nwrite to Senator Dolliver concerning\n"departmental affairs," he never did,\nand never would have given him per\nmission to write a letter criticising\nthe president of the United States.\nUnder cross examination almost\nwholly by the democratic members of\nthe committee, Secretary Wilson was\nuncertain as to just what had passed\nbetween himself and the forester and\nbecame somewhat mixed at times as\nto just what members of the commit\ntee were reffering. To their rapid\nfire of questions the secretary repeat\nedly said he never saw or heard of\nthe letter Mr. Pinchot wrote until it\nwas read in the senate.\nMr. Pinchot had been reluctant to\ntestify to anything that would bring\nhim into controversy with the chief\nunder whom he had served twelve\nyears, but Chairman Nelson insisted\nhe should go into the matter.\nMr. Pinchot declared that he and\nSecretary Wilson went so far as to\ndiscuss the executive order issued by\ni President Taft for bidding subordin\nate officers of the various departments\ngiving information to congress, and\nhe added that the secretary said:\n"You and I will have no trouble\nabout that order."\nAdmitting that his memory failed\nhim, at certain points, Secretary Wil\nson always came back to the state\nment that he never under any circum\nstances would have given Mr. Pinchot\npermission to write the letter which\ncaused his separation from the service\nThe secretary said he urged Mr. Pin\nchot not to carry out his purpose to\n"blanket" the message from the presi\ndent, exonerating Ballinger, by send\ning in a letter to Senator Dolliver.\n"But," persisted counsel for Mr.\nPinchot, "if Mr. Pinchot was only to\nbe permitted to write about depart\nmental affairs, \' how could you have\nthought this letter would blanket the\npresident\'s message?"\n"I don\'t know that was Pinchot\'s\nidea."\nThe day was replete with incidents.\nThe cross examination of Mr. Pinchot\nwas begun, later in the afternoon, and\nwill be continued when the commit\ntee meets again Friday.\nMr. Pinchot denied that he had\nbeen embittered by a dismissal which\nhe considered was not justified. He\ndenied also that there was a specific\nmovement to discredit Mr. Ballinger.\nHe added, however, that he and for\nmer Secretary Garfield, Glasis and\nothers, are concerned in a movement\nfor the conservation of natural re\nsources, and that they regard Mr.\nBallinger as one of the greatest ene\nmies of the movement.\nGeorge Beatty, aged 86. died at the\nhome of his brother.

The election\nreturns from Adair county, relative to\nthe county seat contest between the\nrival cities of Stillwell and Westville\nwere received at the governor\'s office\nthis morning. Westville was declared\nthe temporary county seat of Adair\nby the constitutional convention and\nthere has been a prolonged contest\nand lack of final result since state\nhood. Under the returns as stipulat\ned by the election commissioners to\nte state executive Stillwell has a\nmajority of 32.

Wash., Mar. 2. It is feared\nfifty lives were lost in an avalanche\nthat carried two Great Northern trains\ninto a canyon, near Wellington, yes\nterday. The cars fell a hurdrcd ar.d\nfifty feet and were hurried by the\ndebris. The town of Wellington and\nthe Great Northern power house were\nnot destroyed.\nSeldom in the history of the trans\ncontinental railroads, has the Pacific\nslope been cut off from the rest of\nthe continent as it is today. Of the\nseveral transcontinental lines having\nterminals on this coast only the most\nsouthern roads are open.\n..Superintendent O\'Neill, of the Great\nNorthern, who is directing the relief\nwork in the mountains, telegraphs\nthat sixty lives were lost in yester\nday\'s avalanche.\nAs the further details of the dis\naster that overwhelmed the two great\nNorthern passenger trains, when the\navalanche 6wept the trains and a :ir\ntion of the town of Wellington down\ndown the mountain side, are received,\nthe horrors grow. Twenty-three lives\nare known to have been lost, when a\nmass of snow, loose stones and up\nrooted trees hurled the cars over ths\nnarrow ledge down to the bottom of\nthe cancn, two hundred feet below.\nWhen the last report was received\nfrom the scene twenty-five more were\nmissing. The avalanche rolled down\nthe mountain side this morning and\ntwo trains, three locomotives, four\npowerful electric motors, depot and\nwater tank were swept away and \'de\nposited in a twisted mass of wreck\nage at the foot of the mountain.\nGroans and cries for help, coming\nfrom the heap of debris, indicated\nthat many are imprisoned in the\nwreckage, still alive. Rescuers work\ned with feverish heat to rescue them.\ni The first news of the disaster was\nbrought by John Wentzel, of Welling\nton: "All wiped out," he cried. "There\nis nothing but smooth snow, where\nthe tracks stood."\nRelief trains, carrying physicians,\nnurses and workers, were dispatched\nfrom Everett, bearing provisions to\nlast five hundred persons ten days.\nWalla Walla, Wash., Mar. 2. The\ndanger of the floods in the Walla\nWalla velley and t southern Washing\nton believed to be over as the streams\nhave ben receding since midnight.\nTRAINS\nBURIED\nAVALANCHE\nLL\nML\nIE BONDS\nCity Council Faces a Most Deplorable Condition\nin Eliminating Depression in City Finances\nDeficit of About $12,000 in Funds for\nContingent Expenses Will Ask $20 r\n000 for Extension of City Water\nWorks-Electric Light Franchise.\nWhat is believed to be the nost\nserious proposition that has ever con\nfronted the city council was brought\nto a head at the regular meeting of\nthe board of aldermen last, night,\nwhen two resolutions, providing for\nthe calling of an election, on March\n29, for voting upon the question of\nissuing bonds to pay the deficit ex\nisting in the revenues to pay the con\ntingent expenses of the city for the\nfiscal year ending July 1, and for the\nextension of the water works sys\ntem. The matter of the deficit is a tedi\nous proposition. The state constitu\ntion provides a limit of ten mills tax\nfor the contingent expenses of the\ncity. A ten mill levy on the assessed\nvaluation of . Vinita . yields, in round\nnumbers, $25,000. The city gets addi\ntional revenue from the water works\nand other sources of about $3,000,\nmaking the total revenue for the\nyear about $28,000. It is found that\na conservative estimate of the ex\npenses for the fiscal year will be about\n?40,000, leaving a deficit of $12,000,\nwhich the city has no funds to pay.\nThe constitution in section 26, article\n10, provides a means for the city to\npay such a deficit by issuing bonds.\nIn order to make such an issue legal,\nit will require the consent of three-\nfifths of the voters voting at a special\nelection.\nThe bond course Is thought to be\nthe only way to eleminate a most de\nplorable condition in the finances of\nthe city.\nThe present administration inherit\ned an indebtedness accruing from con\ntracts made by the former administra\ntion for street crossings and other\npublic improvements, which they were\nunable to provide for under the con\nstitutional limit of a ten mill levy. Be\nfore the bond election it will be nec\nessary for the city officials to pre\npare a statement of the receipts and\nexpenditures of the city to show that\nthe funds were expended in a legiti\nmate way. This will require a care\nful review of all of the appropriation\nordinances of the last year.\nThe other bond issue will be for\nthe expenses of enlarging the city\nwater reservoir, drilling additional\nwells and extending the mains to meet\nthe requirements of the rapidly grow\ning city. The memory of the long\ndrought of last summer, when the\nwater supply was insufficient to meet\nthe demands will cause this bond is\nsue to meet with ready favor. This\nissue will require only a majority\nvote to legalize it, whereas the other\nissue will require three-fifths of the\nentire vote.\nIn addition to the discussion of the\nbond issues the council disposed of\nthe usual routine business of making\nthe monthly appropriations, etc.\nThe monthly reports of the various\ncity officers were received and referr\ned to the finance committee.\nThe street and alley committee sub\nmitted a proposed contract with J. C.\nGray for sweeping and sprinkling the\nstreets for a period of one year. The\nconsideration was $225 per month, the\ncity to furnish the sweeper and Mr.\nGray the necessary sprinklers. As the\ncontract was not specific enough in\nregard to the streets to be swept, It\nwas referred to the committee for re\nconsideration.

He jumped out the window\nof the lavatory and is still at large.\nE\n0\n, H 29\nwas referred to the water committee.\nA petition of the property owners on\nSouth Wilson street for an arc light, at\nthe alley 150 feet south of Canadian\navenue, was referred to the light com\nmittee, with the power to act in case\nan agreement as to the location of\nthe light could be reached.\nThe proposed extension of the fran\nchise of the Vinita Electric Light, Ice\n& Power company was to have been\ntaken up, but there was so much oth\ner business that it was decided to ad\njourn the session until this evening,\nat which time the proposed extension\nwill be taken up.\n-\n0 , PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF 0\n0 I FRANCHISE DESIRED. 0\n0 At the adjourned session of 0\n0 the city council tonight, the 0\n0 proposed new franchise for 0\n0 the Vinita Electric Light, Ice 0\n0 & Power . company will be 0\n0 taken. It is the desire of the 0\n0 company that the fullest pub- 0\n0 lie discussion possible may 0\n0 be had of the merits or de- 0\n0 merits of the proposed fran- 0\n0 chise.

The meeting being informal,\nno definite arrangements could be\nmade. It Is now believed the new\nelectric line from Coffeyville south\nthrough the Verdigris valley will be\nextended as far south as Nowata, or\neven further, this summer and the\nproposed steam roads will intersect\nit, each feeding the other in a rapid\nly growing country, both as to pro\nducts of the soil and In manufacturing\nThe roads are backed by Coffeyville,\nCaney and Fort Scott, Kans., capital,\nand Pawhuska, Bartlesville, \'Vinita,\nNowata and Chelsea, Okla., with St.\nLouis builders of note ready to take\nhalf of the expense under their own\nprotection.\nTAYLOR BILL 15\nAmendment to Constitution Will Be\nSuggested as Soon as Governor\nSigns Bill.\nGuthrie, Okla., Mar. 2. By a strict\nparty vote, after a debate limited by\nagreement to an hour ou each side,\nthe house yesterday finally passed the\nsenate bill by Taylor providing a spe\ncial modification of the initiative and\nferendunl by which the democrats ex\npect to place an educational qualifi\ncation, coupled with a grandfather\nclause, in the state constitution.\nThe bill will go to tho governor for\nhis signature as soon as it is "enrolled.\nAs it deals with the initiative and\nreferendum, it Is not subject to a ref-1\nerendum. As soon as the governor\nsigns the bill a joint resolution sug-1\ngesting the amendment of the consti\ntution for the educational test and\ngrandfather clause will be passed.\nThe republicans in their speeches\ncharged that the Taylor bill was a\npart of the plan to disfranchise the\nnegroes of the state. This was ad\nmitted by the democratic orators.\n"If it is the purpose to keep the ne-;\ngroes from voting, I am for it," said\nAnderson, of McCurtaln.\n"I am opposed to the negro voting,"\nsaid Gilmer of Ardmore.\n"Democracy in Okalhoma is going\nto preserve what it has gained in Ok\nlahoma,\' said Wortman, of Claremore. i\n"I believe in government by the\nwhite people. We will pass the elec-!\ntion laws, and no matter how much ;\nboodle your campaign committee has 1\nto use, it will find that your forty\nthousand purchasable voters cannot ,\nbe brought to the polls. The republi- j\ncan party has a wonderful record of j\nnational victories, but a revolution is\nat hand. Your party organizations is ,\ntrying to kill that honest band of in\nsurgents. Two elements in the . re-.\npublican party will destroy each other ;\nand the revolution now in progress, ,\nclearly shown by the insurgency in\nyour party, due to broken compaign ;\npledges, will result In a democratic ,\nvictory."\nCook, of Muskogee, formerly a mem\nber of tho supreme court of North\nCarolina, made the principal speech\nfor the republicans. Cook, who was\na confederate soldier, said he was a\nrepublican, not because of the negro\nbut in spite of him, and that it rook\nas much courage for him to be a re\npublican as it had to face the cannon\'s\nmouth. He expressed the belief that\nthe Taylor bill and the grandfather\nclause would create bitter strife in\nthe state, such as existed in the south\nduring the reconstruction days, and\nthat the negro in forty years of free\ndom had, by education and training,\nbeen fitted for the election franchise.\nHe declared that in the forty years\nsince its emancipation from slavery,\nthe negro race had made more pro\ngress than any other race in the same\nlength of time, excepting the Jap\nanese. The first fire alarm in Vinita dur\ning the last three months, was sound\ned today, when the department was\ncalled to West Illinois avenue to ex\ntinguish a blaze in a small shed.

An option for a few days\nas secured by this company on what\nis known as the Beard tract in Excel\nsior addition, though not a part of\nthe addition. Under this option 11\nfifty foot lots were offered for sale\nat $335 each and 8 fifty foot lots at\n$300 each, and in spite of the snow ly\ning on the ground and the general in\nclemency of the weather, a good por\ntion of the time while the property\nwas being offered every lot was sold\nwithin ten dayB time. Mr. Chas.

The pro\ngram was under the direction of Mrs.\nII. W. C. Shelton and she spared no\npains to make it a success and should\nbe given much credit for her untiring\nefforts. The scenes were from Amer-,\nlean history and extended from the\nlanding of Columbus to the days of\nWashington.\nThe program was too varied to ad\nmit of mention of ail, but Arthur Per\nshing and Miss Rose Gill as George\nand Martha Washington were espe\ncially clever and in their colonial cos\ntumes made a very pleasing picture.\nSome very realistic scenes from In\ndian life were given and were very\nmuch enjoyed. Another feature which\'\nadded much to the program was the\npiano selections by Miss Pearl Hayes,\nof Muskogee.\nGRAND JURY MAY NOT\nCALL "YAfiB" DOCTOR\nBy Associated Press,\nKansas City, Mo., Mar. 2.

N. BUNCH,\nChairman Craig County Election\nBoard.\nVinita, Okla., March 2. 1910.\nWashington, March 2. Washington\npolitical circles are no better in\ni formed now as to the attitude Theo\ndore Roosevelt is going to take In the\napproaching congressional elections\nthan they were a month ago. Stand\nj patters, progressives and democrats\n.are straining their ears for sounds that\nwill indicate which side of the fence\nthe strenuous ex-president and rhino\nhunter is going to be on, as regards\nthe Taft and- LaFollette factions cf\nthe republican party. But so far not\nan inkling of Information appears to\nhave been received from Africa.\nPending information from the cor\nrespondents awaiting Roosevelt in\nCairo, both standpatters and progres\nsives are claiming Roosevelt\'s sym\npathy. lThe progressives are unable\nto see how Roosevelt can indorse Taft\nwithout indorsing Aldrlch and Can\nnon. The three are Inseparably linked.\nThe president, Senator Aldrich and\nSpeaker Cannon form a triumvirate.\nThey co-operate even on the smallest\nthings, and each of the triumvirs pub\nItPTy pays tribute t6 the wisdom and\nstatesmanship of the other two.\nIf Colonel Roosevelt should go so\nfar as to endorse the Taft-Aldrich-Can-non\nadministration, as John A. Ste\nwart, president of the New York state\nleague of republican clubs asserts he\nwill do, it is difficult to see how he\ncan retain his present hold on those\nwestern editors who have recently\nbeen voicing their dissatisfaction with\nthe Taft administration. An endorse\nment of Taft by Roosevelt will in all\nliklihood mean that Senator Robert\nM, LaFollette will Btep into T. R.\'s\nplace as the logical one to rescue the\nrepublican leadership from the con\ntrol of the trusts and special interests.\nBut will Roosevelt endorse the work\nof ;Taft? In their eagerness to arrive\nat some conclusion, both standpatters\nand progressives have gone over his\nrecord with a fine tooth comb. Here\nare some of the things they found:\nThat as an assemblyman in New\nYork state, as civil service commis\nsioner, and as police commissioner,\nRoosevelt was regarded less as a re\npublican than as an independent. He\nwas theoretically, at least, in those\ndays, a believer in free trade. He co\noperated freely with Mr. Cleveland\nwhen the latter was governor of New\nYork, and he opposed the nomination\nof James G. Blaine in 1884. Carica\ntures of that period represented him\nas a \' mugwump, grouping him with\nGeorge William Curtis and Carl\nSchurz. Yet, none the less, he was es\nsentially a party man. His own ex?\nplanation of his attitude at that time\nwas Interesting and may be now care\nfully weighed by anyone who may de\nsire to try to prophecy what Roose\nvelt is going to do when he returns to\nAmerican soil. He said:\n\'I intend to vote the republican\npresidential ticket. A man cannot act\nboth without and within the party. He\ncan do either, but he cannot possibly\ndo both. It is impossible to combine\nthe-\'.\'unctions of a guerrilla chief with\nthose of a colonel in the regular army.\nThe one has greater independence of\naction, the other is able to make what\naction he does take vastly more effec\ntive! I am by inheritance and educa\ntion a republican. Whatever good I\nhave been able to accomplish in pub\nlic has been accomplished through the\nrepublican party. I have acted with\nit in the pust, and wish to act with it\nin the future."\nAgain the query: What will Roose\nvelt do? Will he be a regular like\nTaft, Aldrich and "Uncle Joe" or a\n"guerrilla," like LaFollette, Clapp,\nBristow, Dolliver, Cummins, and mil\nlions of western republicans?\nBUCKET HONEY\nPeople\'s 6rocery\nCompany\nWHITES POOL HALL\nUp Stairs\nIn Ratcliff Building\nVinita Camp No. 7051\nThird floor, over First National Bank\nMeets 1st and 3rd Tuesday nights.\nVoting members always welcome.\nE. c, DALQUEST.
