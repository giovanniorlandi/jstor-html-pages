This study aims to determine the role of ITAP caused by East Asian\nanthropogenic emissions (EAAEs) under current and future emission and climate sce-5\nnarios. ITAP from East Asia is enhanced in the future due to faster wind speeds aloft\nand a stronger low pressure center over Eastern Russia that facilitate enhanced westerly\nexport in the free troposphere and stronger southerly transport near the surface,\nincreased gaseous precursor emissions, and increased temperatures. As a result, the\ncontribution of ozone (O3) generated by EAAEs to the global average O3 mixing ra-10\ntio increases by ∼0.8 ppb from 1.2 ppb in 2001 to 2.0 ppb in 2050. The contribution of\nPM2.5 generated by EAAEs to the global PM2.5 level increases by ∼0.07 µgm\n−3 from\n0.32 µgm−3 in 2001 to 0.39 µgm−3 in 2050, despite a non-homogenous response in\nPM2.5 resulting from cloud and radiative feedbacks. EAAEs can increase East Asian\nbiogenic secondary organic aerosol by 10–81 %, indicating that it is largely control-15\nlable. EAAEs also increase the deposition of nitrogen, black carbon, and mercury both\nlocally and downwind, implying that they may play a role in climate feedbacks and\necosystem health of these regions. These results show that EAAEs have a large impact\non global air quality and climate, especially on downwind regions. Such impacts\nmay be enhanced under future climate and emission scenarios, demonstrating a need20\nto synergize global pollution control and climate mitigation efforts.\n1 Introduction\nIntercontinental transport of atmospheric pollution (ITAP) is of major concern as it can\noffset the impact of local emission control efforts in certain regions (Jacob et al., 1999;\nLin et. al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009, 2012). ITAP of fine aerosols has also been shown to25\nbe a health hazard resulting in an estimated 90 000 premature deaths globally in 2000\n26490\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

ITAP plays a large role in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), as this is\nthe most populated part of the globe, with three major industrial centers including East\nAsia, North America, and Europe. East Asia is the most important source region as its\nlower latitudes and thus higher surface radiation and vertical transport make it more\nsuitable for local ozone (O3) photochemical production and transport (Bey et al., 2001;5\nWild and Akimoto, 2001; Stohl et al., 2002). As a result, the Asian free troposphere\nhas been shown to have a large global impact on the seasonal variations and vertical\nstructure of O3 throughout the troposphere (Sudo and Akimoto, 2007). North America\nis also an important source to global pollution but it is the most affected receptor\nto Asian emissions and to a lesser extent by European emissions (Wild and Akimoto,10\n2001; Fiore et al., 2009). Europe is typically the weakest source region, as weaker\nconvection and the dominance of high pressure systems in summer make horizontal\nboundary layer advection the primary transport mechanism and this type of transport is\ntypically blocked by the Eurasian terrain and the pollutants are subject to greater local\ndeposition, but transport to the Arctic makes Europe the most important contributor to15\nArctic haze especially in winter (Wild and Akimoto, 2001; Stohl et al., 2002). Additionally,\nEurope is a receptor since East Asia has a large global impact (Wild and Akimoto,\n2001).\nTransport from East Asia to North America occurs primarily through uplifting associated\nwith the warm conveyor belt of mid-latitude cyclones, which lofts the pollutants20\ninto the lower free troposphere (FT) where they are transported by westerly winds (Bey\net al., 2001; Husar et al., 2001; Hess et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2003;\nCooper et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2009, 2012). Additional transport pathways include\nplanetary boundary layer (PBL) outflow behind cold fronts (Liu et al., 2003; Wang et al.,\n2009, 2012), orographic uplifting in China (Liu et al., 2003), and strong convection (Liu25\net al., 2003; Takigawa et al., 2005). This uplift is usually associated with fast transport\nthat can occur in as quickly as six days (Jaffe et al., 1999, 2003) Intercontinental\ntransport from North America to Europe has not only been linked to uplift from warm\nconveyor belts, but also to pyro-convection from wild fires (Ravetta et al., 2008).

(2009) showed that certain pollutants such as CO, O3, PM2.5, and SO\n2−\n4 favor\ntransport in both the PBL and lower FT, while other pollutants such as PAN, SO2, and\nNO−3 primarily transport in the lower FT. Wang et al. (2012) showed that dust particles\ntransport at altitudes above 5 km.\nAlthough it may be counter-intuitive, ITAP plays a much larger role in the boreal5\nspring and autumn months as compared to the summer when production of pollutants\nsuch as O3 are higher (Wild and Akimoto, 2001; Shindell et al., 2008; Fiore et al., 2009;\nJonson et al., 2010). This is because although convective uplift is greater in the summer,\nthere is more stagnation and thus less significant horizontal transport. Additionally,\nthe lifetime of O3 is relatively shorter in the summer months due to the additional wa-10\nter vapor resulting from greater evaporation. This occurs because (1) there is a greater\nchance for O(1D) to react with H2O to form OH rather than O which reduces O3 production,\nand (2) the increased OH or HO2 from this process can react remove O3 directly.\nThus, transport is most effective in spring as the frequency of uplift from mid-latitude\ncyclones is high and the westerly transport is more direct (Wild and Akimoto, 2001).15\nHowever, it can still play a minor role in the summer, e.g., it accounts for 3 % of the\nNorth American O3 budget (Pfister et al., 2008).\nThe Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) was formed in\n2004 to improve the understanding of ITAP in the NH. The HTAP program included\na multi-model ensemble of experiments that compared the impact of 20 % reductions in20\nanthropogenic emissions from their baseline levels in the four largest industrial centers\nincluding Europe, North America, East Asia, and South Asia. The aim of these multimodel\nensemble experiments was to estimate the sensitivity of each region’s ambient\npollution to these emission reductions. These studies, along with others were compiled\ninto the 2010 Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution report (TF-HTAP)25\n(http://www.htap.org/). These experiments found that during spring months the 20 %\nemissions reductions largely from Asia can reduce the ozone level over 1 ppb or greater\nat Trinidad Head, CA at the surface and throughout the troposphere (Jonson et al.,\n2010). These reductions in East Asia emissions typically result in a decrease in the\n26492\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

The emission reductions of O3 precursors from\nEast Asia were estimated to decrease the annual mortality rate in North America by 2005\ndeaths but could decrease the number of premature deaths by as much as 5900 over\nthe entire NH (Anenberg et al., 2009). The experiments also revealed that long-term\nresponses to surface ozone from emissions reductions of CH4 is as large as the impact\nfrom reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), total non-methane volatile organic\ncompounds (VOC), and CO combined (Fiore et al., 2009). A subset of the HTAP models10\nreveals that projected climate change increases the impact of reducing anthropogenic\nemissions in source regions but reduces the impact on receptor regions (Doherty et al.,\n2013). In addition to the impacts on O3, these emissions reductions have been shown\nto decrease the reactive nitrogen deposition in North America by 1.3 % (Sanderson\net al., 2008). The HTAP modeling also showed that East Asia contributes 19 %, 31 %,15\n29 %, and 28 % to the Arctic sulfate, black carbon (BC), CO, and O3, respectively during\nthe spring months. During the summer months when the BC snow albedo feedback is\nthe strongest, BC deposition from East Asia is important and comparable to that from\nNorth America (Shindell et al., 2008).\nOther studies have also investigated the impact of long range transport of East Asian20\naerosols (Park et al., 2004; Hadley et al., 2007; Koch et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2008; Yu\net al., 2008; Leibensperger et al., 2011). It is estimated that 4.4 Tga−1 of fine aerosol\npollution is imported to North America from Asia, which is equivalent to approximately\n15 % of local emissions (Yu et al., 2008). This transport contributes 10–30 % and 30–\n50 % to the background sulfate over the Eastern and Western US, respectively, and25\n75 % to the BC over North America (Park et al., 2004; Hadley et al., 2007; Liu et al.,\n2008). Emissions of other compounds such as NOx and CO in East Asia have also\nbeen shown to increase the concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) by 1.0 µgm\n−3 in the\nEastern US (Leibensperger et al., 2011). Additionally, aerosols emitted from East Asia\n26493\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

Compared to ultrafine\nmarine aerosols, long range transport of anthropogenic particles in stratified layers\nfrom 1000–7000 m above the surface of the Eastern Pacific have been shown to play\na more important role in the aerosol direct and indirect effects as their larger size in-5\ncreases their likelihood of activation and thus effectiveness of scatter radiation (Roberts\net al., 2006). Light absorbing aerosols have been linked to the enhancement of winter\ntime convection over the North Pacific (Zhang et al., 2007) and to dynamic and thermodynamic\nfeedbacks that can alter the Asian monsoon (Lau et al., 2006a, b). The light\nabsorbing BC aerosols emitted in East Asia have also been shown to result in dim-10\nming of 1.45–1.47 Wm−2 in the Western US (Hadley et al., 2007). In China, increasing\naerosol emissions provides a plausible explanation for the decreasing solar radiation\nreaching the surface despite decreasing cloud cover (Qian et al., 2003, 2006, 2007).\nIt has also been shown that areas with high anthropogenic emissions, such as East\nAsia, can contribute substantially to the formation of local biogenic secondary organic15\naerosol (BSOA) (Carlton et al., 2010 and references therein).\nThis study aims to determine the role of the ITAP from East Asian anthropogenic\nemissions (EAAEs) in global air quality and climate under current and future emissions\nand climate scenarios. Specifically, several science and policy-related questions will\nbe addressed. For example, how will the role of ITAP change under future scenarios?20\nWhat processes and factors will dominate such changes? How much BSOA can be\nreduced through reducing EAAEs? Such information would be very useful to guide the\ndevelopment of future emission control and climate mitigation strategies in a changing\nclimate.\n2 Experimental design25\nThe model used in this work is the newly developed Global-through-Urban Weather\nResearch and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (GU-WRF/Chem) of Zhang et al.\n26494\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

This model is an online-coupled meteorology and chemistry model, which\nenables the simulation of the climate feedbacks associated with aerosols and radiative\ngases from global to urban scales. It was developed by first replacing the WRF model in\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA)’s mesoscale WRF/Chem\nwith the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)’s global WRF (GWRF) and5\nthen improving several model treatments for their applications on hemispheric to global\nscales including online dust and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emissions,\ngas-phase chemistry, a photolytic rate scheme, aerosol chemistry and micro-\nphysics, and aerosol-cloud interactions. GWRF and GU-WRF/Chem have been evaluated\nusing meteorological, radiative, and chemical observations from surface networks10\nand satellites. They demonstrate satisfactory performance as compared to other existing\nglobal and mesoscale atmospheric models (Zhang et al., 2012a, b).\nGU-WRF/Chem simulations are first completed for the full years of 2001, 2010, 2020,\n2030, 2040, and 2050 to characterize the trends of climate changes based on an average\nof current years (AOC), consisting of the years 2001 and 2010 and an aver-15\nage future time period (AOF) consisting of the years 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050.\nThese results will be presented in a separate paper. In this work, the boreal spring\nmonths (March, April, and May (MAM)) during 2001 and 2050 during which ITAP is\nthe strongest for the Trans-Pacific region are selected to study the role of intercontinental\ntransport of East Asian air pollutants and their impacts on the US and global air20\nquality and climate. Additional simulations under different emission and climate scenarios\nfor MAM 2001 and 2050 are conducted and compared to those of the MAM\n2001 and 2050 simulations as part of the aforementioned multi-year simulations. The\nsuite of model simulations conducted includes three baseline simulations with EAAEs\nduring MAM: 2001 with current climate conditions and emissions, 2050 with projected25\nclimate change and emissions, and 2050 with projected climate change only (referred\nto as 2001, 2050, and 2050_CCO, respectively), and three sensitivity simulations in\nwhich EAAEs are removed in the East Asia region including China, North and South\nKorea, Japan, and portions of India, Mongolia, Southeast Asia, and Russia.

The anthropogenic\nemission inventory used for the 2001 simulations is described in Zhang et al. (2012b)\nand the 2050 emissions are generated using regionwide growth factors based on the5\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions version 4\nA1B scenario. The growth factors are developed following the approach of Nakicenovic\net al. (2000) and RIVM (2001) and are provided in the Supplement. Natural emissions\nof BVOCs, dust, and sea-salt are calculated online using the Model of Emissions of\nGases and Aerosols from Nature version 2 (MEGAN2) (Guenther et al., 2006), the10\ndust scheme of Shaw (2008) with the modifications of Zhang et al. (2012b), and the\nsea salt scheme of Gong et al. (1997) with an updated treatment for smaller sea-salt\nparticles from O’Dowd et al. (1997), respectively. The initial conditions for meteorological\nvariables and some chemical species such as CH4, N2O, and O3 in all simula-\ntions are generated from the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3)15\nSRESA1B data set. Initial conditions for additional species not available from CCSM\noutputs (e.g., PAN, H2O2, and SO2) are generated from the Goddard Earth Observing\nSystem Model with Chemistry v7-04-12-Run0 (GEOS-Chem). The initial conditions\nobtained from CCSM3 are decadal mean values to reduce interannual variability in the\nsimulations, thus the 2050 simulation is initiated by the average of CCSM3 output for20\nthe period of 2045–2054. 2001 was initialized by the average of CCSM3 output from\nonly the five year period 2000–2004 due to lack of data during 1995–1999. The initialization\nof species from GEOS-Chem data was based on monthly mean values. Since\nfuture GEOS-Chem simulations were not available, all years are initialized using the\nsame dataset as that for 2001. A one month spin-up period is used to bring all chemical25\nspecies into equilibrium with the new emissions and provide initial conditions for missing\nspecies. The meteorological fields are reinitialized every month from CCSM3 and\nthe chemical species are initialized based on the previous month’s simulation. A more\ndetailed description of model configurations can be found in Zhang et al.

The predictions of GU-WRF/Chem are\nalso compared with those from an established climate model, i.e., the NCAR’s CCSM5\nto demonstrate its skills in simulating current and future climate. Figure 1 compares the\naverage MAM 2 m temperature (T2), 2 m water vapor mixing ratio (Q2), precipitation\nrate (PR), and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) for the GU-WRF/Chem 2001\nand AOC simulations and CCSM3 initial conditions (2000–2014). Similar plots for 2050\nare shown in Fig. 2 in contrast to the AOF from GU-WRF/Chem and CCSM3 initial10\nconditions (2015–2055).\nIn general, the 2001 and 2050 simulations have the same general spatial pattern as\nthe AOC and AOF from GU-WRF/Chem, respectively. The global average T2 in 2001\nand 2050 is 0.09 ◦C and 0.5 ◦C larger than the AOC and AOF values, respectively,\nwhile the values are ∼4.0 ◦C warmer than the CCSM3 current and future periods. The15\ndiscrepancy between GU-WRF/Chem and CCSM3 most likely results from a warm bias\nof ∼4.0 ◦C against National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) global observations. The\ndifferences between the individual years of 2001 and 2050 and longer term average\nAOF and AOC are smaller than the differences between the average current and future\nperiods (1.37 ◦C warming between 2050 and 2001, 0.79 ◦C warming between AOF and20\nAOC, and 1.46 ◦C warming between CCSM3 AOF and CCSM3 AOC), indicating that\nthe differences in T2 between the subset period, i.e., 2050 and 2001 are representative\nof the average climate change between future and current years. The global average\nQ2 is 0.09 gkg−1 less in 2001 than AOC and 0.02 gkg−1 more in 2050 than AOF. The\ndifferences against CCSM3 are much higher (0.72 gkg−1 between 2001 and CCSM25\nAOC and 0.84 gkg−1 between 2050 and CCSM AOF), which may be due to an overprediction\nof ∼0.5 gkg−1 in the GU-WRF/Chem baseline simulation. Similarly to T2,\nthe climate change signal between the current and future simulations (i.e., 0.67 gkg−1\n26497\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

For comparison, the increase in PR between CCSM3 AOF and CCSM3\nAOC is 0.08 mmday−1. The differences in climate change singal in PR between the\ntwo models are mainly due to differences in the cumulus and resolved cloud schemes.\nThese differences are similar in magnitude to the discrepancies between 2001 and10\nAOC (0.01 mmday−1) and 2050 and AOF (0.02 mmday−1), indicating that differences in\nthis parameter cannot clearly be differentiated from internal model variability. Changes\nin the PBLH between the CCSM3 output and GU-WRF/Chem are quite large. There is\na trend of decreasing PBLH in GU-WRF/Chem with global average decreases of 29 m\nbetween 2001 and 2050 and 15 m between AOF and AOC, whereas the changes in15\nPBLH are insignificant between CCSM3 AOF and AOC (with an increase of 1 m). This\ndiscrepancy in climate change signal in PBLH between models is due to differences in\nthe PBL parameterizations used different models (Murazaki and Hessm, 2006). However,\nthe climate change signal is much larger than the variability between years (4 m\nbetween 2001 and AOC and 8 m between 2050 and AOF).20\nAlthough some differences between climate change signals obtained using single\nyear differences (i.e., 2050–2001) vs. multi-year average differences (i.e., averages\nof 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 minus averages of 2001 and 2010) due to interannual\nvariability, the above comparison suggests that the differences in meteorology\nand subsequently chemistry between the 2001 and 2050 simulations are generally25\nrepresentative of a climate change signal obtained using multi-year averages of GUWRF/Chem\nsimulations.

The anthropogenic emissions of O3 precursors, NOx\nand VOCs, increase over most of the globe, with the exception of the US, Canada,\nWestern Europe, Australia, and portions of Northern Asia, leading to global average\nincreases by 38 % and 23 %, respectively, according to the A1B scenario.

Black carbon\n(BC) emissions are reduced largely in the US, Canada, Japan, Western Africa, and\nWestern Europe (20–60 %) with smaller decreases in China (< 20 %) and increases\nover the remainder of the globe. Emissions of primary organic aerosol (POM) largely5\ndecrease by 20–75 % over much of globe, with the exception of Northern Asia, North\nAfrica, Australia, and portions of South America, leading to a global average decrease\nby ∼19 %. These emission changes give no clear insight into the possible changes in\nEast Asian PM2.5 as changes over Southeast Asia are typically opposite to those over\nChina and Japan. Overall, North America, with the exception of Mexico, will experience10\na decline in local anthropogenic emissions by 2050 based on the A1B scenario. Thus,\nincreases in ambient concentrations of pollutants in NA could be attributed to enhanced\ntransport from other regions, enhanced natural emissions, or enhancements from climate\nchange.\nThe SRES A1B emissions used in this study are not directly comparable to any of15\nthe current IPCC regional concentration pathway (RCP) emission scenarios. The moderate\nRCP pathway with a stabilization of anthropogenic radiative forcing at 6 Wm−2\nby 2100 (RCP6.0) is an updated version of the SRES B2 scenario which is more optimistic\nscenario than A1B (Masui et al., 2011). The most pessimistic RCP scenario\nwith a stabilization of anthropogenic radiative forcing at 8.5 Wm−2 by 2100 (RCP8.5)20\nis an updated version of the SRES A2 scenario, which is considered a relatively more\npessimistic scenario as compared to A1B (Riahi et al., 2011). The RCP6 scenario includes\nemission reductions over much of the globe but increases in emissions of all\nthe aforementioned species in China and some portions of Africa, which does support\na more optimistic scenario than A1B. The RCP8.5 scenario more closely matches25\nwith the A1B scenario, especially in East Asia and North America, where emissions of\nNOx and VOCs largely increase and emissions of BC and POM largely decrease over\nmost of East Asia, and emissions of most speciesexcept for NH3 decrease in North\nAmerica.

Among all emitted species, the trends in NH3 emissions differ the most as A1B\nindicates decreases in both North America and East Asia, whereas RCP8.5 increases5\nemissions in both regions.\n5 Impact of EAAEs on current and future air quality\nThe predicted flow patterns at 10 m and 5500 m and the sea level pressure for 2001,\n2050, AOC, and AOF are shown in Fig. 4, which illustrates two major pathways of ITAP\nfor East Asia. At the surface, there is both a northerly track that exports pollutants to10\nthe Arctic and a stronger westerly track that transports the pollution over the Pacific\nOcean to Western North America. The key feature generating this transport is an average\nanticyclone centered over the East China Sea that exports pollution from East\nAsia to the north and east. This is similar to the findings reported in Zhang et al. (2008),\nwhich indicated a northern transport pathway that is associated with circulation around15\nthe Aleutian low and a southern branch responsible for transport to North America associated\nwith circulation around the Pacific high. These two transport pathways were\nconsidered to be representative of Trans-Pacific transport climatology (Zhang et al.,\n2008). In general, the surface pressure patterns are similar among all scenarios with\na few key exceptions. In 2050, 2050_CCO (figure not shown), and AOF a stronger20\nlow pressure center exists over Eastern Russia than in 2001 or AOC, which results in\nenhanced transport to the Arctic. Additionally, the average low pressure system over\nthe North Atlantic lifts to the north and east (to a lesser extent in AOF than 2050)\nwhich removes the stagnant (i.e., low wind speed) conditions over Northern Europe\nand Scandinavia in 2001 and AOC. In the free troposphere, transport is primarily west-25\nerly. Simulated wind speeds aloft increase over East Asia and decrease over Southern\nNorth America in both 2050, 2050_CCO, and AOF. This increases the westerly export\n26501\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

In 2001, O3 generated by EAAEs\ncontributes 1.2 ppb to the max 8 h O3 on a global average, with higher values in several\nregions (e.g., 3–33.5 ppb in East Asia, 1–2 ppb in Western North America, and 1–3 ppb\nin the Arctic). In 2050, this contribution increases to ∼2 ppb of max 8 h O3 on a global\naverage, and in several regions (e.g., 4–44.6 ppb in East Asia and 2–5 ppb in Western10\nNorth America and the Arctic). This is primarily a result of projected increases in East\nAsian emissions of O3 precursors in the future, with some regional enhancement from\nclimate change. The 2050_CCO simulations have the same contribution of 1.2 ppb on\nglobal average as 2001, but a somewhat different pattern in regional contributions (e.g.,\n3–37.7 ppb in East Asia, 1–3 ppb in Western North America and the Arctic). The differ-15\nences in O3 between the 2001 and 2050_CCO simulations are the result of the 1–3\n◦C\nincrease in temperature over most of East Asia (except Southeast China with cooling\nby ∼1 ◦C) and changes in the atmospheric flow pattern. 2050 has enhanced Arctic\ntransport from the stronger low pressure area over Eastern Russia, which leads to an\nincrease of O3 in the Arctic, especially Alaska and Western Canada. The 2050_CCO20\nsimulations show eastward and northward transport of the plume that is stronger than\n2001 due to higher temperatures but weaker than 2050 due to lower O3 precursor\nemissions. There is also an enhancement in Western Mexico, due to a combination of\nless water vapor which increases the lifetime of O3 and greater subsidence of O3 from\nthe reduction in wind speeds aloft.25\nThe vertical cross sections of O3 show large differences between 850 mb and 400 mb\nfor all simulations and the gradients are tilted toward the east, indicating that the O3\nis uplifted and carried eastward.

In 2050, greater generation of O3 from increased precursor\nemissions and temperatures leads to greater lofting of O3 into the FT and subsequently\ngreater subsidence of O3 downwind compared to 2001. In 2050_CCO, there is less\nlofting and thus less of a downwind impact on O3 as compared to 2001. This results\nfrom increases in atmospheric stability, particularly from the surface to ∼850 mb, that5\ninhibits vertical transport. This indicates that future emission changes may overwhelm\nnatural transport restrictions from climate change.\nEAAEs also enhance the levels of other trace gases such as carbon monoxide (CO),\nsulfur dioxide (SO2), and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). EAAEs contribute ∼13 ppb and\n∼16 ppb to the global average CO level under the current and future scenarios, re-10\nspectively; the increase in 2050 mainly results from emission increases in Southeast\nAsia as the 2050_CCO simulations with and without EAAEs show only a slightly increased\ncontribution (∼14 ppb on global average) as compared to 2001. The impact of\nEAAEs is fairly uniform across the entire NH where they typically account for 5–10 and\n10–30 ppb of the CO level in 2001 and 2050, respectively, but the impact is greater in15\nimmediate downwind regions such as North America, where the impact is 10–25 ppb\nin 2001 and 15–35 ppb in 2050. EAAEs-induced SO2 has a weak transport signal as\nit accounts only for ∼1–5 ppb in local areas of East China and Northeast India under\ncurrent and future scenarios, but has a negligible contribution elsewhere. EAAEs contribute\n∼2 ppb SO2 to the 24\n◦ N to 60◦ N meridional averaged surface concentrations20\nwith a decreased contribution of ∼0.05 ppb up to ∼450 mb between 75◦ E and 150◦ E\nand negligible contributions elsewhere. PAN exhibits a similar spatial distribution of\ncontributions as O3 since they share the same precursors. In 2001, EAAEs contribute\n∼0.04 ppb (0.2–1.0 ppb East Asia) to the global average PAN level and this nearly doubles\nto ∼0.07 ppb (0.2–1.8 ppb in East Asia) in 2050 as a result of increased precursor25\nemissions. The 2050 emission increase also generates contributions of 0.1–0.2 ppb to\nthe PAN level over the majority of the NH compared to a more negligible contribution in\n2001. The 24◦ N to 60◦ N meridional averaged vertical PAN contribution exhibits a similar\ntrend.

The contribution is ∼0.1–0.2 ppb over much of the North Pacific\nand portions of Western North America above 900 mb, indicating that there is transport\naloft but the subsidence to the surface is negligible. In 2050, the contribution over East\nAsia increases to ∼0.9–0.3 ppb from the surface to roughly 450 mb due to the increase\nin precursor emissions. The enhancement of PAN aloft leads to additional eastward5\ntransport with contributions of ∼0.1–0.2 ppb at the surface in Western North America,\nEurope, and North Africa due to subsidence.\nFigure 6 shows the differences in the 24 h averaged surface concentrations and the\n24◦ N to 60◦ N meridional averaged vertical profiles of PM2.5 with and without EAAEs\nfor 2001, 2050, and 2050_CCO. The impact of EAAEs on PM2.5 is not as homoge-10\nneous as the impact on some trace gases because its concentration and formation are\nmore sensitive to changes in climate. On a global average, EAAEs account for 0.3–\n0.4 µgm−3 in all scenarios with a slight increase from 0.32 in 2001 to 0.39 µgm−3 in\n2050 on a global average but larger increases in some regions (e.g., up to 3 µgm−3 in\nthe Pacific Ocean) (despite projected reductions in primary aerosol emissions in 2050),15\nwith most of the positive contributions over East Asia and the North Pacific. Over the\ninterior of North America in all scenarios, EAAEs reduce the surface PM2.5 level by\n0.5–1.5 µgm−3. This can be attributed to the increased PBLH generated by EAAEs in\nthis region. The mechanism by which EAAEs can impact PBLH is discussed in greater\ndetail in Sect. 6. A similar situation occurs over Scandinavia in the 2001 simulations,20\nwhere EAAEs reduce the local PM2.5 level (by ∼0.5–3 µgm\n−3). This impact is larger\nthan that over North America due to the stagnant conditions over Scandinavia, during\nwhich vertical mixing becomes the strongest meteorological process impacting PM2.5\n(with wind speeds < 1 ms−1), but does not occur in 2050 or 2050_CCO due to the\nlow pressure center that moves into this area in the future scenarios. Feedbacks from25\nEAAEs to the 10 m wind speed (see Fig. 9) are distinctly different among all scenarios,\nwhich lead to differences in the concentrations of sea salt emitted in marine environments\nand concentrations of dust emitted over North Africa. This implies that such\nfeedbacks are heavily dependent on both anthropogenic emissions and climate.

This occurs because only stratiform cloud feedbacks are treated in this\nversion of the model and these clouds are typically not present above ∼500 mb. At this5\naltitude, EAAEs increase the PM2.5 level by 0.1–1.0 µgm\n−3. This is why the impact on\naerosol optical depth (AOD) (see Sect. 6) is almost entirely an increase over most of\nthe NH despite the surface PM2.5 impact being either positive or negative.\nFigure 7 shows the contributions of EAAEs to surface BSOA and the total deposition\nfluxes of total nitrogen, black carbon, and mercury (TNTD, BCTD, and HgTD,10\nrespectively) (i.e., the differences in the surface BSOA, TNTD, BCTD, and HgTD between\nthe simulations with and without EAAEs for 2001 and 2050). EAAEs demonstrate\na strong impact on the BSOA in East Asia. EAAEs increase BSOA in East Asia by 0.1–\n1.2 µgm−3 (10–81 %) with large areas experiencing an increase of 0.5–1.2 µgm−3 (50–\n81 %) under all scenarios, indicating that a large fraction of BSOA in East Asia is con-15\ntrollable through controlling EAAEs that affect the oxidant levels for the oxidation of\nBSOA precursors. These results are consistent with the work of Carlton et al. (2010),\nwho reported that over 50 % of the BSOA is controllable over the Southeastern US.\nHowever, further downwind EAAEs can decrease the amount of BSOA as they reduce\nincoming shortwave radiation fluxes at the Earth’s surface (ISR), in turn decreasing the20\nphotolytic rate of NO2 (JNO2) and the amount of hydroxyl radical available to oxidize\nBSOA precursors.\nEAAEs account for ∼0.01–0.9 gm−2 month−1 (40–98 %) of TNTD in East Asia and\nthe North Pacific in 2001 and ∼0.01–0.6 gm−2 month−1 (20–97 %) in 2050. The decrease\nin 2050 is the result of a projected decrease in emissions of NH3. This indicates25\nthat EAAEs are a contributor to the nitrogen fertilization of the Pacific Ocean and can\nenhance ocean productivity in areas that are nitrogen limited (Duce et al., 2008). Another\nkey difference in 2050 is an increase of 0.001–0.002 gm−2 month−1 (10–40 %) in\nTNTD over Alaska and other portions of the Arctic due to enhanced southerly trans-\n26505\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

This enhanced Arctic deposition may help fertilize Arctic\nvegetation increasing their growth (Schindler and Bayley, 1993), thus potentially\namplifying the climate feedbacks from enhanced shrub growth in that region (Chapin\net al., 2005). EAAEs increase the global average BCTD by ∼ 3.0×10−3 gm−2 month−1\nunder all scenarios. In all scenarios EAAEs increase Arctic BCTD by ∼ 1×10−4–5\n8×10−4 gm−2 month−1 (∼10–80 %). This implies that EAAEs may be a leading contributor\nto enhanced melting of Arctic snowpack as BC lowers the snowpack albedo (War-\nren and Wiscombe, 1980; Clarke and Noone, 1985). Additionally, EAAEs contribute to\nBCTD in both the Tibetan Plateau (1×10−3–3×10−2 gm−2 month−1 or 20–80 %) and\nmountainous regions of Western North America (1×10−3–1×10−2 gm−2 month−1 or10\n10–40 %), which could impact the melting of snow that is an important reservoir of water\nfor local populations (Hadley et al., 2010; Qian et al., 2011). EAAEs increase the\nglobal average HgTD by ∼ 2.0×10−8 gm−2 month−1 (∼48 %), with varying contributions\nin different regions (e.g., 40–98 % in East Asia and the North Pacific and 20–70 % in\nthe Arctic). In particular, EAAEs increase HgTD in North America by 10–40 %. These15\nresults are consistent with the work of Seigneur et al. (2004) and Strode et al. (2008),\nwho reported that Asian anthropogenic emissions contribute 5–36 % and 14 % to the\nHg deposition in North America, respectively. The large contributions over all these\nregions imply that EAAEs-induced HgTD could be a large source of methylmercury,\nwhich is bioavailable and can accumulate in rice crops and aquatic life leading to hu-20\nman exposure (Zhang et al., 2010; Meng et al., 2011).\n6 The impact of EAAEs on the climate system\nEAAEs affect regional and global climate under all scenarios.

The\nimpacts across all scenarios are the largest in East Asia (5×107–1.3×109 cm−2),\nthe North Pacific (5×107–1.2×109 cm−2), and portions of North America (5×107–5\n1.5×108 cm−2). The column CCN can also be reduced by EAAEs, as much as\n∼ −3.0×108 cm−2, in regions including Western Asia, Europe, and Africa, as a result\nof decreased aerosol number. Such decreases may result from decreasing nucle-\nation of new particles or slight increases in precipitation over portions of those regions.\nThe general increase in CCN translates to domainwide increases of 8.3×104 cm−210\n(11.5 %), 5.3×104 cm−2 (8.5 %), and 7.9×104 cm−2 (19.5 %) in CDNC in 2001, 2050,\nand 2050_CCO, respectively. CDNC also increases the most in East Asia (2.0×105–\n2.7×106 cm−2), the North Pacific (2.0×105–1.0×106 cm−2) and portions of North America\n(1×105–4×105 cm−2) but there are certain regions, such as Mexico in 2050,\nwhere EAAEs can result in a sizeable decrease (1.0×105–3.0×105 cm−2). These15\ndecreases are associated with decreases (2–6 gm−2) in the cloud liquid water path\n(LWP). The greatest impact of EAAEs on CDNC occurs in areas with the greatest LWP.\nIn East Asia, these areas include Southeast Asia and Northeast China. In 2050 and\n2050_CCO, these areas of larger LWP migrate to the northeast and the impact on\nCDNC becomes stronger due to the stronger low pressure area over Eastern Russia.20\nEAAEs increase the global average COT by ∼0.2 with larger increases of 0.5–4.5 in\nEast Asia and its downwind areas in both 2001 and 2050, as shown in Fig. 8. In 2050,\nthe impact on COT is spread more evenly over the North Pacific, while in 2001 the\nimpact is concentrated in the vicinity of the Philippine Sea. This results from changes in\nthe global distribution of cloud LWP between 2050 and 2001, where the LWP increases25\n(by 2–18 gm−2) in the northernmost portion of the Pacific and Alaska and also in the\nsubtropical North Pacific, there is also a decrease (by 2 to 6 gm−2) over the Philippine\nSea which weakens the impact in that region.

In both 2050 and 2050_CCO, the\nimpact on AOD is reduced in the Arctic as a result of the stronger zonal transport over5\nEast Asia, which reduces the meridional transport of particles.\nThe increase in COT and AOD reduce the ISR by ∼2.8 Wm−2 in 2001, ∼2.5 Wm−2 in\n2050, and ∼3.0 Wm−2 in 2050_CCO on global average. The reductions can be as large\nas 38.2 Wm−2 (18.3 %), 32.6 Wm−2 (17.8 %), and 41.8 Wm−2 (21.7 %), respectively, in\nEast Asia and the North Pacific. Over East Asia, the changes in ISR follow the pattern of10\nCDNC, because increases in CDNC increase COT and result in decreasing ISR. The\nreduced ISR also leads to a reduction in JNO2 by ∼ 2.4×10\n−3–2.8×10−3 min−1 on\nglobal average across all scenarios. The reductions can be larger than 5×10−3 min−1\nover East Asia, the North Pacific, and North America, indicating that EAAEs reduce\nphotochemistry over the majority of the NH. This primarily reduces the production rate15\nof atomic oxygen gas (O), which then leads to a reduction in the rate of formation of\nO3 and OH. The amount of O3 is not significantly impacted as changes in precursor\namounts and transport are more dominant; however, the OH level is reduced slightly\nby ∼ 1×10−3 ppt on global average. This slight reduction in oxidants can reduce the\nproduction of condensable organic gases and lead to slight reductions in aerosols,20\nsuch as BSOA, as mentioned previously.\nThese changes in cloud properties and radiation from EAAEs propagate through the\natmosphere and alter the meteorology of the globe. Figure 9 shows the differences\nin 2 m temperature, PBLH, and 10 m wind speed between the simulations with and\nwithout EAAEs for 2001, 2050, and 2050_CCO. The aforementioned EAAEs-induced25\nchanges result in global cooling of ∼0.05 ◦C in 2001, ∼0.02 ◦C in 2050, and ∼0.04 ◦C in\n2050_CCO. In 2001, the temperatures decrease by 0.25–1 ◦C in East Asia over regions\nwhere COT increases, indicating that changes in ISR are the controlling force. In North\nAmerica, the temperature decreases by −0.25–2 ◦C over Northwestern US and West-\n26508\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

Both of these regions\nexperience decreased ISR from EAAEs, but the extra cloudiness over Eastern Canada\nenhances the downwelling of longwave radiation, leading to an average temperature\nincrease. In 2050, the cooling over East Asia from EAAEs is about 0.25–0.75 ◦C and\nthere is warming over Northeastern China of 0.25–1.25 ◦C again from greater down-5\nwelling of longwave radiation. Over North America the cooling is also about 0.25–1 ◦C,\nexcept over Alaska where stronger reductions in ISR decrease the temperature by\n0.5–1.5 ◦C. It is important to note that changes in global 2 m temperature are not represented\nin marine environments as the configuration of GU-WRF/Chem simulations\nused in this work does not contain an ocean model component to simulate the response10\nof sea surface temperatures to changes in radiation. In addition to the surface temperature\nover the ocean, humidity in the marine boundary layer and large scale pressure\npatterns which are controlled by sea surface temperatures will not be impacted by\nchanges in chemistry since sea surface temperatures are static.\nDespite their spatial and magnitude discrepancies, all the above impacts have simi-15\nlar trends under both the current and future scenarios with a few exceptions. PBLH is\na good example of this exception, since there is no clear trend in the global average\nwith and without EAAEs. In 2001 and 2050, the global average difference with and\nwithout EAAEs is a negligible increase of 0.03 m and decrease of 0.8 m, respectively,\nwhile the 2050_CCO simulation shows a more pronounced decrease of 2.5 m. The lack20\nof a clear trend is most likely because PBLH is not only sensitive to changes in the atmosphere\nbut also to the interactions with the underlying land and ocean surface. This\nsensitivity may also explain why there is no robust model trend in PBLH from climate\nchange (Murazaki and Hess, 2006). However, despite the lack of a clear global trend,\nthere are some stronger regional signals in East Asia, North America, and Scandinavia.25\nThe contributions of EAAEs to PBLH over East Asia and North America are complex\nbut there is a general trend for decreases of 20–100 m that are spatially co-located\nwith changes in CDNC and COT. The increases in CDNC increase COT, reducing the\namount of ISR reaching the surface; this decreases the amount of energy that is ex-\n26509\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

The contribution\nof EAAEs to PBLH in Scandinavia is not consistent, with an increase of ∼10–\n70 m in 2001 and a decrease of ∼10–30 m in 2050. The pattern for 2050_CCO is even\nmore complex with an increase over Norway and Sweden and decrease over Finland.5\nThe inconsistency in this region comes from changes in the flow pattern. Scandinavia\nlies on the boundary between the average cyclone over the North Atlantic and the average\nanticyclone over the Mediterranean Sea. These two surface features have different\npositions in the different scenarios and thus the meteorology of Scandinavia and the\nimpact from EAAEs vary with their movement. In 2001, when Scandinavia experiences10\nstagnant conditions from the average cyclone being further upwind, the increase in\nPBLH from EAAEs in this scenario has a strong impact and reduces the PM2.5 level at\nthe surface by ∼1–3 µgm−3 (see Figs. 2 and 6). This implies that chemistry feedbacks\nto meteorology from emission reductions may have the opposite effect on air pollution\n(i.e., enhance pollution) in some locations under certain conditions. The impact of15\nEAAEs on PR and 10 m wind speed varies with both emissions and climate scenario\nand since the differences between the current and future scenario are relatively small,\nno robust information can be gleaned.\n7 Concluding remarks\nEAAEs have a strong impact on climate, air quality, and potentially the ecosystems of20\nnot only East Asia but other regions downwind under both current and future climate\nand emission scenarios. This is especially true for the Arctic which, in addition to the\naforementioned impacts, is expected to undergo many changes (e.g., amplified warming,\nsea ice retreat, and strong ocean acidification) by the latter half of the 21st century\n(Steinacher et al., 2009; Vavrus et al., 2012). The dominant impacts of EAAEs are to25\nincrease chemical concentrations (e.g., O3, CO, PAN, PM2.5), total deposition fluxes of\nchemical species (e.g., total nitrogen, BC, Hg), most cloud/optical variables (e.g., CCN,\n26510\n', 'ACPD\n13, 26489–26527, 2013\nWill the role of\nintercontinental\ntransport change in\na changing climate?\nT.

Controlling EAAEs can re-\nduce not only the concentrations and depositions of anthropogenic-induced pollutants\n(by up to 100 %) but also BSOA (by 10–81 %). However, some aerosol-cloud feedbacks\n(e.g., changes in PBLH) may potentially compensate the improvements expected from5\nemission reductions in some regions (e.g., Scandinavia in 2001).\nThe intercontinental transport of Asian pollution will likely play a more important role\nin the future due to enhanced eastward and northward transport, increased gaseous\nprecursor emissions, and increased temperatures under the climate and emissions\nscenarios considered in this work. In particular, the O3 and PM2.5 concentrations10\ncaused by EAAEs in 2050 will increase by 0.8 ppb and 0.07 µgm−3, respectively, on\nglobal average and by up to 3–12 ppb and 1–3 µgm−3 over some regions. This demonstrates\na need for the governments of involved countries to consider the complex inter-\nplays between air pollutants and climate to develop integrated emission control strategies\nfor optimal air quality management and climate mitigation.15\nSupplementary material related to this article is available online at\nhttp://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/13/26489/2013/\nacpd-13-26489-2013-supplement.pdf.\nAcknowledgements.
