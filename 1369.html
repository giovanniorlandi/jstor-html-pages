There Is room\nfor difference of opinion and argu\nment on the suggestion, hut the\nweight, of reasons seems to be with\nthe proposition. Figures and calcu\nlations made by the non-partisan\nand noii-factional tax commission\nclearly show that railroads and oth\ner corporations pay less than their\nproportion of luxes by over $(100,000\nper year. If a special session is held\'\nand the proposed law passed, it will\nmean SOOO,OOO for tlie state treasury\nthis year, which otherwise will lie\nlost. True, the legislature might re\nfuse to pass the law, hut if it should,\nthere will remain no peg on which\nto longer hang the misrepresentation\nthat the governor is in-mcere in his\ndemands for tax reform.\nBETTER NO MONUMENT.\nMr. Mi-fl\'i-rsiim Dnvi*\' monument, by nil\nprinciples rf in-li , slnmiil In* ill ft park, re\nnioti* from tin* new life which now animates\nKielnnoml i spot for meditation, ami not for\nIntrusion.

So the game went, with a\ndecided superiority of skill on the\nside of Mineral Point. Prof. Bray\nplayed second base for Linden, and\nour boys soon discovered that it was\nnot the best thing -to do to place a\ngrounder anywhere near him. Ovitz\nfanned sixteen men, Hart, the Linden\n“twirler” fanning only seven. On ac\ncount of the high wind very little\nheavy batting was done, the in field\nhaving most of the work. We were\nall disappointed in the crowd, how\never, for but few came up to witness\nthe game.

In this way the creamery\ngets a greater patronage than the other\ncreameries by fraudulent means.
