Both, France and Great Britain have urged, that our army be not withdrawn en, tirely, first because of the moral effect, of such action, and next because of, the necessity of alKcd troops taking, the place of the Americans. The bur, den of occupying the Coblenz-region, will fall the heavier upon France, it, is assumed, inasmuch as the British, have declined to send additional men, to Germany or to enlarge the sphere, of operation of those already there., There has been no official announce, ment in Washington that the with, drawal of the American troops has, anything to do with the reparations, question. So far as the formal com, munications today go one would sus, pect no relationship between the two, propositions, but those who kept in, touch with the, successive moves in, the reparations situation, quite un, derstand that the Administration, be, fore dispatching its note on the ques, tion of America sharing in the Ger, man money now available, undertook, to make its arguments more impres, sive bv first ordering the men home., Only four days ago the secretary of, war. then on a vacation with Presi, dent Harding in Florida, announced, without qualification that the army of, occupation would be reduced to 2.000, men by April 1. and would remain at, that strength indefinitely., The day following the return of the, President and the secretary of war to, Washington it is anonunced that all, of the American troops will be, brought home by July 1. That this, swift decision was reached after the, President had gone over all phases of, the matter with his secretary of state,, is weli understood here. Yesterday, morning Secretary Weeks made pub, lic the following brief statement:, Some months ago the President di, rected that the troops in Europe, at, least in excess of 2,000 officers and, men. should be returned to the Unit, ed States by the regular transport, service which was then and is now in, operation., TOWN TO VOTE, CHARTER REPEAL, Question of Potomac Re, maining Incorporated to, be Decided April 18, 1Y: mission to Vote on Question (liven, By Legislature?\\bout ">00, Voters in Town, Freeholdtrs of the town of Poto, mac. embracing Del Ray and St., Elmo, will vote in a special election, to be belt! April IS on the question, of whether or not they will remain, an incorporated town. It is reported, that the ^ freeholders are about ?, evenly divided on the subject and a, close vote it is said is anticipated., There are about 500 qualified voters, on the list and the indications are i, that most of those entitled to vote!, will cast a ballot in the coming elec, tion., The legislature recently passed a, bill authorizing the town to repeal, its charter if it so desired. For, about ten years past the town 01, Potomac has been incorporated., As the time approaches- for the, election the interest becomes more, pronounced., WASHINGTON, DAY BY DAY, I (From Our Special Correspondent.), : Washington, March *21.?President, Harding has issued orders for the, 1 return of all the American troops, , on the Rhine, leaving only a small, force for the graves registration, service in France. Secretary of War, \' Weeks in making the announcement, said that the troops would be, ! brought home by the regular trans, i port service and that the last mar?, would he out of Germany by July 1., ; Approximately -1,000 troops are in, volved in the order, the American, i Expeditionarv Force having been re, j duced gradually since the advent of, ? the Republican administration,, j Secretary Weeks denied that the, ! return of the troops was influenced, ! either by the action of the House in, | cutting off appropriations for the A., 1 E F., after July 1 or by the inter, i national tangle that has been pre, i cipitated by the American demand, J for payment of the $241,000,000 al, J ready due this government on ac, count of the American Expedition, ary force Nevertheless there is a, distinct feeling in diplomatic circles, that the return of the troops is an, other evidence of American dissat, isfaction with the French program, in regard to Germany and the whole, question of international finances., The government\'s deficits in the j, next few years will be heavier than j, are now indicated by the Treasury |, Department because of large pay- j, ments on war claims. Billions of i, dollars are involved in suits of, claimants filed with the Court of, Claims, and billions more will be at, stake in new litigation which the, Department of Justice now finds it i, will have to defend. Officials of the, Department declare that war claims, litigation provided in itself the dan, ger of a heavy drain upon the na, tional finances for several years to, come. Attorney General Daugherty\'s, latest estimate is that new suits for I, the payment by the government of j, alleged losses sustained by the liti- j, gants will involve between $2,000., 000,000 and $3,000,000,000, Suits al, ready filed in the Court of Claims, j, growing out of war contracts under i, many of the war emergency stat- j, utes already involve several billion, dollars, officials said., The rising market in foreign ex, change is putting millions into the, pockets of American business men, in the race to gain world trade it is, shown in reports to the Department, of Commerce and to the Federal, Reserve Board., A rising market in foreign ex- j, change puts cash into American\', pockets through two direct channels.!, Thousands of persons who bought i, foreign money at low rates last year, are now in a position to sell and take, their profits. The gain of these!, speculators has been estimated at!, more than $100,000,000. Rising ex, change rates in the second place, make it easier for American manu, facturers, farmers and exporters to, sell their goods abroad. A rush of;, foreign orders ordinarily follows a;, rising market. The United States j, now is selling goods abroad in great- !, er volume and for higher prices, than any other exporting nation in, the world. The American export, business will total more than five, billion dollars during 1922, it is pre, dicted. if the exchange markets con*, tinue their upward trend., A nation-wide strike of bitumi, nous coal miners, regarded as certain, to commence April 1. will find the, nation\'s fuel bin well stocked, against the crisis, according to re, ports to the Federal Reserve Board., More than 5-1,000,000 tons of bi, tuminous coal are in storage through, out the country, the reports show,, insuring a supply of fuel for indus, try and transportation that can be, expected to last for nearly two, months. Coal on hand will be very, greatly increased in volume by Ap, ril 1. it is believed. Buying is heavy, in nearly all districts. Dealers arc, well stocked wth anthracite to sun, ply domestic needs. Railroads and, public utility companies are partic, ularly well supplied with fuel, against the emergency They have, or. hand supplies sufficient for more, than 50 days operation, according to, the Federal Reserve Board report., Gas plants are equipped to weather, a walk-out. l isting three months., Isaac Gregg., WAIVE HEARING, Three Colored Men and Complainant j, Held For Grand Jury, Three young colored men register, ed on the police blotter as Jack Skel, ton, Graham White and John W., Thompson, charged by Ephriam, Brown, colored, of Springfield, Fairfax, county, of robbing him of $8.50 in, broad daylight last Saturday, waived, a hearing in the police court today, and were held for the action of the, grand jury.

Mayer. The, reapportionment was made effective, March 3., The order was granted on applica- \'<, tion of counsel for nearly 100 rail, roads, who submitted a petition as, serting that the rate ruling was arbi, trary and outside the powers of the, commission. j, The proceedings were said to con, stitute the first case in which the, powers of the Interstate Commerce, Commission, as exercised under the, Transportation act of 1920, have been, questioned., Nearly all Eastern roads, with the, exception of the New York Central,, the Pennsylvania and Baltimore and, Ohio, joined in the petition., They stated that a joint rate agree-,, ment among themselves and other\', roads operating between New England, and points north of the Ohio and east, of the Mississippi river would be up, set by the commission\'s ruling, which, reduced by 15 per cent, the propor, tion of joint rates on interregional, shipments given to Eastern lines and \', added the percentage to the amount, allocated New England carriers., The New England roads whose com, plaints led to tbe making of the order, by the commission are the Central, New England, Bangor and Aroostook,, Boston and Maine, Central Vermont., Maine Central, New York, New Haven, and Hartford, Rutland and their sub, sidiaries and operated lines., Chicago, March 21.?Demanding an, official ruling on whether the rail, roads had heid proper conferences, with their employes before bringing, their wage reductions controversies to, the Railroad Labor Board, B. M. Jew, ell, head of the shop crafts unions,, finished his testimony on the confer, ences yesterday and asked for an ad, journment until a ruling is made by, the board., Mr. Jewell charged that conferences, on various roads showed that there, had been no real effort to negotiate a, new wage scale, as provided by the, Transportation act, prior to taking, such matters to the Labor Board., The shop union leaders denounced, the roads for failure to put in effect, lower rates following the $400,000,000, wage reduction of last July, adding, that revision of working rules had, ac, cording to estimates from all parties,, further reduced the carriers\' labor, bill by $2o0.000,000. None of these, savings, said Mr. Jewell, had been, translated into lower rates., Representatives of the carriers will, be permitted to make their rebuttal, to the Jewell charges before the, board takes any action., BOY BURGLAR, CASE MARCHES, Continuance Granted Today, By Justice Duvall, In meantime Police Will Check up, Statements of Young Martsch, In the police court todr.y the in, vestigation of the case of Donald W., Martsch, fifteen years old, who toid, ? the police that he recently burglariz, ed the residence of former Congress, man Charles C.

The, clubhouse together with its contents, was completely destroyed. All that, today remains of both places is the, charred framework of both structures., That both blazes were set on fire, by the same party or parties is the, opinion of the nolice also the opinion, of members of the club., It is estimated that the loss to, building and equipment will be in the, neighborhood of $ 1 (3,000 and is par, tially covered hy insurance. The in, surance is about $0,000 it is reported., The firemen had returned to their en, gine houses shortly before 1 o\'clock, when the blaze was discovered at the, clubhouse of the Old Dominion Boat, Club.

He did, not say he would ei\'htr veto or ap, prove the new Bonu* bill, and it is, understood he was not asked that, question., Jt is generally believed that the, President will veto the measure, should it reach him in its present, form.

However, under such, ?i rule at least one motion to re, commit must \'?? allowed, and this*, motion is feared because it will give, opportunity for proposals on a cash, bonus, a sales tax. a revival of the, excess profits taxes -the latter being, the pet hobby of a number of Demo, crats?and other embarrassing sug, gestions not now in the bill, and, upon which the House leaders do not, want to In- forced to vote., JUDGE MONCURE, IS SUSTAINED, State Court of Appeals Af, firms Decision of Cor, poration Court, Refuses Writ of .Mandamus in The, Case of Arthur Bryant, The stale court of appeals has, handed down a decision denying a, petition for a writ of mandamus in, the case of Arthur Bryant trading,, etc., against Robinson Moncure,, judge, affirming the action of Judge, .Moneiire in refusing to sign a cer, tain hill of exceotion.

The, object of the meeting is to, determine upon a plan by, which the nomination of the, best five men for the new, City Council may be assured., This is not only important,, but it is vital to the success, of the City Manager plan., With the election of five such, men as Alexandria can fur, nish, if she so elects, the, choice of a city manager will, be in good and safe hands. |, With \'a city manager big, enough, broad enough, prac, tical enough, and experienc-1, ed enough, to seize upon the, unsurpassed opportunities;, afforded by this city, Alex-j, andria will stride forward, at a pace that will astonish., her neighbors and strike, with wonder even her own;, citizens. That this is well, within the range of possibii-;, ity no one doubts who has, witnessed the regeneration j, and upbuilding of other:, cities with a mere moiety of j, our natural advantages, i, What has been done can be:, done again. And it has been!, done right here in our own\', state in a half-dozen in-:, stances., On the other hand if we:, fail in the selection of the!, right material for council-1, men, the odds loom large, against the choice of the\', right man for city manager. I, ; That spells defeat for the, . plan and disaster for the, city. So we cannot take too, much pains or exercise too, much care and caution in, taking the initial step?, which is the wise choice of,, our city council., The invitation to the mass, meeting is clear and explicit, in its terms. The sole object, of the meeting is Alexan-I, dria\'s welfare. It is to be, non-partisan and non-politi, cal. Neither creed nor call, ing nor party affiliation en, ters into its organism. It is a, business proposition, pure, and simple, because the ad-j, ministration of a city itself, is a business proposition and, none other! Every citizen is, invited to be present and, take part. It is a service to ?, Alexandria that you are in, vited to perform. It is a, duty imposed upon you by, every tie that binds you to, your neighbors in the city of, your home. It is an obliga, tion that you cannot shirk, : and still hold up your head, | among your fellow-men., 1 Alexandria needs you!, I Alexandria calls you!, See to it that you admin, ister to her need. Fail not, in your obedience to her, : solemn mandate!, Make no other engage, ment for next Monday, 8, o\'clock, P. M., twenty, seventh instant. Be on hand, : at the Elks Hall, on that day,j, | at that hour, that you may:, j exercise the proudest pre-\', j rogative known among peo-1, ipies today ? that of the,, franchise of an American j, ; citizen in choosing his public |, ! servants! I, REVENUE REGULATIONS, . I, Compensation for personal services j, in the form of salaries, wages, com-j, missions, fees. tips, bonuses and, pensions form the principal item in, ?\' the returns of millions of taxpayers., As a general rule, all such income is, i subject to tax. However, there are, , exceptions with which the taxpayer, j in the interests of self as well as the j, ! Government, should familiarize him-1, ! self. _, Salaries paid to its officers and.,, employees by a state or "political,, ; subdivision thereof" (city, town,, \' county or hamlet) are exempt from, i taxation. The reason for this is that, i the Federal Government does not tax ,, such activities of a state. Fees re, ceived by a notary public commis, sioned by a state are not taxable,!, neither are fees paid jurors by a ^, 1 state or political subdivision thereof.., Witnesses in law suits, however,, even j, though subpoened by state\'s attorney i, are not considered employees of the ], state, and fees receivesl\' by them are, subject to taxation., The commissions of a\' receiver ap-!, pointed by state, county or municipal?, court are not-taxable. The commis-[, ; sions of an administrator or executor i, are taxable because they are not\'\', paid by a state or political \'subdivis-1, ion, but out of the estate of the de-;, ceased. V \' 3 :?, Salaries of federal officers and, employees, including! those df the, territories and the District of Co, lumbia are subject to tax. ? Salaries, and fees paid by the United States to, its ambassadors, minister\'s or con, suls accredited to ^foreign\'countries, or by a foreign Government to, United States citizens art taxable,, -and the amount spent, by > them for, entertaining is nondeductible. . Fees, paid a juror by the Federal Govern, ment are taxable income, likewise, the fees received by a refere, trus-;, tee or receiver, under the National I, Bankruptcy Act. The fees received, by a notary public commissioned by, the District of Columbia are taxable., Annuities paid by the government, to retired employees are ? subject to, tax to the extent that the aggregate, amount of the payments exceeds the |, amounts withheld from the compen-t, sation of the employees. Amounts;, deducted and withheld from the ba- j, sis salary pay or comncpsation paid,, to employees in the civil service of, the United States, in accordance with, the provisions of the act providing, for pensions to Government em, ployees should be reported for income, tax purposes. The total compensa, tion of the employees should be re, ported in gross income. No corres, ponding deductions can be taken for I, the amounts withheld, in asmuch as, such amounts are payments towards j, the purchase of annuities provided-\', for in the act., Inquiries received indicate the i, impression in the minds of many, persons that all school teachers are j, exempt from payment of the income, tax. Teachers are not exempt be- j, cause engaged in educational work. |, As a rule the salaries paid public, school teachers are exempt, but only;, for the reason that they are em- j, ployees of a state or political subN, division thereof., The special exemption of $3,500 al- j, lowed under the revenue act of 1018, persons in active service in military;, and naval forces is repealed by the^, revenue act of 1921. Soldiers and, sailors are allowed only the exemp, tions granted other individuals, SI,000, if single, or married and not living, with wife of husband, $2,500 if mar, ried and living with wife or husband 1, and the net income for 1921 was, $5,000 or less, and $2,000 if married, and living with wife or husband and ,, the net income was more than, So,000. .1, TEMPERATURE, In health the body tempalurc var- ], ies only a few degrees, r.o matter, how much the temperature of its sur, roundings varies; consequently a tem, perature of a healthy person The, tcmpertaiure is taken by means of a, clinical thermometer placed cither in |, the mouth, the rectum or the armpit., To take the mouth temperature, which, is the way most frequently used, first, wash the thermometer, using cold, water and absorbent cotton or clean, soft cloth. Never wash the thermom, eter in hot water or the figures will i, com? ofT. Next shake it until the, mercury thread registers OS degrees, or under. It is well before purchas, ing a thermometer to see whether it, can be shaken down easily. Next1, place the thermometer in the patient\'s, mouth with its bulb under his tongue, and leave it for two minutes while ,, the patients lips are closed.

The majority of the, 3\'Judents w^re Italians and there- !, fore were eager to go to work and, raise money to help the foreign boys, and girls and especially the children, in Italy., Immediately a Red Cross box was, placed in each room, into which the, Juniors dropped their spare pennies, Soon the number of boxes was doubled, as cach room must needs have a girl\'s, box. Every week the money was col, lected and a record kept of each class\'s, contribution. Competition ran high, and pennies and small silver poured, into the fund to the extent that the, nearby storekeepers complained that, they had no small change during the, v/eek. ? They also declared that the, sale of gum and cheap candy had fal, len off materially and "lollypon, cheeks\'\' were no longer to be seen., Another way in which these Juniors, raised money Was by running special, moving picture shows in the school, hall.., In addition to the amount contri, buted to the National Children\'s Fund, the Junior\'s raised over $900 for, community projects, The Red Cross was helped in many, gfther ways.

There was no advantage from, an efficiency standpoint in piece-work, over day-work in locomotive repair, shops., "2. That locomotive maintenance, costs per 1,000 pounds of tractive, power mile were greater in the region, working piece-work than they were, in the region working day work., "3. That it was not possible under, the piece-work system to avoid large, pnymonts to workmen for v ork which, was not performed. In fact, on the, Pennsylvania Railroad it was found, that the officials had voluntarily over, paid piece-workers to the extent of, more than $2,500,000., "4. No substantial difference in the, general condition of equipment was, found in the piece-work region as, compared with the day-work region on, 1 roads where work was properly super, vised and a high standard of main, tenance required.", Mr. McAdoo testified that less than, 10 per cent of all employees in the, ^maintenance of equipment depart, ment were at any time, during Fed, eral control, working on the piece, work system; therefore, authorizing, it to be discontinued, he declared,, could not have seriously affected, maintenance costs either during or, since Federal control., For the information of Congress,, Mr. McAdoo submitted the official re, ports of the investigations and rec, ommendations upon which he author, ized abolition of piece-work., Under date of December 16, 1918,, Frank McManamy, assistant director, of the bureau of operations of the, FOll INDIGESTION, GAS,, SOUK, ACID STOMACH,, TAKE "DIAPEl\'SIN", "Papc\'s Diapepsin" is the quickest,, surest relief from Indigestion, Gas,, es, Flatulence, Heartburn, Sourness,, Fermentation or Stomach Distress, caused by acidity.

I, understand the Baltimore and Ohio, has overpaid their piece-workers. The, Philadelphia and Reading, during the, first two weeks of August, overpaid, their piece-workers to the amount of, $50,000.", In a report dated December 1, 1918,, Mr. McManamy reported the result, of an investigation undertaken at the, request of the board of wages and, working conditions into the practices, and results of piece-work., In the Northwestern region, where, mechanics were paid 10 cents more, per hour, and where day-work pre, vailed, the cost of maintenance was, materially lower than in the Alle, gheny region, where piece-work was, in effect., "From this," the report adds, "it, would appear that so far as cost of, maintenance is concerned, the advan, Women!

Mc, Manamy said:, "It is a fact that at every shop, where we have conducted an in\\\'csti, gation or made a check we have found, that payment is regularly made for, large quantities of work which has, not been performed, also that much of, the work is not well performed., "On the Boston and Albany we, found that some work was paid for, as high as four times. Particular ref, erence is made to one case where the, workers put in time slips and received, pay for removing and applying 900, flues in a boiler which only contained, 202.
