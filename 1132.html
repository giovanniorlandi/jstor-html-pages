Hess, an em?\nployee on the section force of the\nrailroad.\nIt seems, from the best informa?\ntion we can obtain, that Hess\nloaded up with whiskey on Christ?\nmas morning and started out to\ncelebrate. At McGuire\'s store be\nmet with ltatliffe, who, be say?, he\nnever saw before. Several alterca\ntions took place, and in tbe end\nHess shot Katlille: the ball enter?\ning the left side? about the waist\nbaud of his pants, and ranging\ndownward, lodged in the hip. Kat\nliife was not thought to be seri?\nously hurt. II? was taken home,\nand on Tuesday Dr. St. Clair, o?\nthis place, and Dr. Williams, ol\nKichlands, performed an opera\ntion. Katlitre died on Thursday\nHe was a young man, about twenty\nyears old, aud unmarried.\nA reporter of the Nsws risited\nHess in the jail here on Mouday.\nHeas told the reporter that he knew\nnothing whateverof the shooting?\nthat he was too drunk to know\nanything. Bo said that he did\nnot know that he had shot Batliffe\nuntil ha was told so when he\nsobered up at Mr. Gillespie\'s, where\nbe was tried. His brother, who\nwas arrest-d also and lodged in\njail as au accomplice, tells the\nsame story. Neither of them know\nanything. They were both very\ndrunk on the day of the shooting.\nHess is about 30 years old, and\nhas a wife and two children. He\ncame from Russell county to Cedar\nBluff about a year ago.\nENGINEER KILLED.\nOn Saturday morning before\nChristmas a double headed east\nbound freight train left the track\neast of ?St. Paul, and tbe engineer\nof the foremost engin?, M. J.\nBeecher. was instantly killed. He\njumped when the accident occurred,\naud it is supposed, struck his head\nagiuist a rock. No one else waa\nbur*.\nBeecher, with n wife and one\nchild, lived iu Bluefleld. He was\none of the most popular men on\nthe road.\nChristmas Week in Town\nThe past Christmas was a typical\non?. The weather which plays au\nimportant part in tbe enjoyment of\nthe holiday was just right, remind\ning one of the "old time Christmas."\nSuow began to fall on Sunday\nnigbt, and during the eutire week\nthe ground was covered, though the\nweather was not eold with the\nexception of about two days.\nFestivities began early. There\nwere numerous parties, ?.linings, so?\nciables, dances, etc-, etc. 1\'romiueut\namong these may be mentioned the\nfollowing :\nTazewell College led off with a\ncreditable entertainment 0.11 Friday\nevening before Christmas, in the\nCollege chapel, given by the pupils\nof the school. There were tableaux,\npantomines, songs, recitations, etc.\nA large audience was ?present The\nentire proceedings were highly cred\nitable to all parties concerned. Ou\nChristmas day Mr. A. J. Hteel?? bad\nquite a number of his friends to din?\nner, in honor of bit? daughters visit\nMre. E. L. Andtewa, of Bristol and\nbia son Fred, who was home from\nRichmond College.

Gillespie. also gave a\nvery enjoyable sociable to a number\nof tbe young people of the town, aa\ndid also Misa Ethel Wratkins, at her\nhospitable borne on Tazewell avenue.\nAll of these soci--bles were highly\ncreditable and greatly enjoyed by\nthe young people.\n<^reat interest centered in the\nHfcice ftiven by Dr. C. T. St.Clnir on\nWeduesday evening. A number of\nthe older set who seem to have rele?\ngated to the rear this Christmas,\nasserted their rights on this occasion.\nDr. and Mrs. St. Clair know bow to\ngive their guests a good lime. Their\nnew and splendid house reoeiv?*.! ?\nroyal christening and one of tbe very\nbest occasions of the season was had.\nRev. and Mrs. French gave a very\nunique party. It may be appro\npropiiately termed, we suppose,\n"A Tacky Party." A tariff was laid\nupon all guests who dared to dl*M\nexcept iu tbe most droll and common\nmanner?and upon those who did\ntoo. The proceeds which were lib.\neral, were given to charitable pur\npeses.\nTHK CAKE WALK.\nThe cake walk and banquet, at the\nTown Hall by the colored people, on\nChristmas night, was quite a swell\naffair. Bro. Davis, the pastor and\nhis people, gave an entertainment\nwhich delighted the attendants ?ery\nmuch?a nu moer of whom were\nwhite people. The cake was won\nby Miss Lyde Cousins, a daughter\nof Jas. Cousins aud (he presentation\nspeech made by promising youngat\ntorney of our town. Afc this festival\nof our colored friends every body\nboth colored and wnite left their\nrazors at the door, and a quiet time\nwas had. About $35 was realized,\nwhich was for church purposes Bro\nDavis had a royal christmas, of\ncourse.\nThus passed the holidays. The\nyoung set seemed to be in the sad?\ndle. The older people seemed to\ntake not much interest iu Christmas\nthis year. Of coins**- the small boy\ngot in his work, but only to a limit?\ned extent Mayor Doak had charge\nof the fire works of Christmas and\ndid uot indulge in anything loudei\nthan a pop cracker?2 packs for 5\ncents?in the back yard with little\nJim,and forbade all others to indulge\nAt the time of this writing, the\ntown baa quieted down and taken\non a 1900 air of dignity and the\nlittle folks are beginning to ask,\n"how long is it before next Christ\nm as?"\nTOTHBDEAF?A rich lady,\ncored of her deafness and noises\nin the head by Dr. Nicholson\'s\nArtificial Ear Drums, gave $10,000\nto hia institute, so that deaf peo?\nple nnable to procure the Ear\nDrums may have then, free.
