They bum\nbetter when the fount is full of oil.\nWhen the Inside of the fount is found\nto have a sediment, the residue of\noil should be rured out and thrown\naway, or strained and used .for other\nhousehold purposes, such a cleaning\nmoldy or damp woodwork In the cel\nlar or in combination with - boiling\nwater and soap for cleaning the iron\nsink in the kitchen. Ue only the\nbeet and clearewt oil for lamps.\nCheap keroeene often give forth un\npleasant odors and doe not burn\nbrightly.\nNever leave a lamp turned low. It\ncreates gas and uses up as much oil\nas when it burns brightly. If It Is\nnecessary to have\nnight in a sick room use a tiny night\nlamp and burn it at full force.\nIn a eonntry house where a large\nnumber of lamps are used It 1 bet\nter to keep them In a little closet by\nthemselves than to expose them on\na shelf in the kitchen, where they are\nsure to collect dust.\nof white give It neatness and flntsa,\nwhile the blue gives it the required\nnote of color.\nHere is an important thing to re\nmember, also: Let there be some em\nbroidery or a lace application upon th?\nafternoon shirt waists, says the Brook\nlyn Eagle.\nThe girl who wants to be very styl\nish will put in her spare time making\nwheels of lace and wheels of silk. Let\nthe wheels be about the size of a sil\nver dollar, and. in the middle of each,\nset a small button. The lace wheels\nhave in the center another little\nwheel of lace, and for evening it Is the\nthing to place the tiniest button rose\nin the middle of the lr-ce wheel.\nThere is a new style of neck finish\nwhich is very much liked. It looks\nvery much like a collar and, indeed,\nit is such. But, instead of being\nsquare in sailor fashion, It is cut in\ntwo long deep points in front tha\ncome down almost to the belt line\nThese points are edged with valen\nclennes lace which goes ail the way\naround the collar. There are long\ndeep points upon the shoulders that\ncome down over the sleeve quite to\nthe elbow. The back is finished in\npoint. This is charming carried out in\npiece lace.\nA little touch ot black appears upon\nall fall gowns. It is absolutely neces\nsary for the style of the gown. Tiny\nblack velvet buttons are very becom\ning to any dress.\nIn the stock line the stock can be\nwhite with a band of black, or a touch\nof black embroidery, to set It off.\nDeep black silk cuffs with wide\nwhite lingerie frills are about the\nsmartest things in the cuff line and\nthey give the touch of black and white\nso necessary to any gown no matter\nwhat Its color.\nHEAVY RUGS\nSmall Sizes\nLbs.

His\ncry is a long-drawn-out moan, which\nreverberates in pathetic cadence up\namong the chimney pots and sounds\nnot unlike "stlckyflyops." The strang\nest feature ot this strange man Is his\nouter garb, which la composed entirely\nof the merchandise he offers for sale,\nand is thickly plastered with those In\njects which have the least to gain and\nthe most to lose by alighting In Its Im\nmediate proximity. BUI. Jack, Jere\nmiah, or Jerry for short, makes a good\nliving out of his calling. As soon as\nthe buxora housewives hear his famil\niar wall, they flock to the windows and\nsignify their Intention of becoming\ncustomers by\'a friendly nod or a wave\nof the hand. The flypaper man walti\npatiently at the door until it Is opened,\nand pastes In one, two or three "slices"\nas requested, receiving the correct\nchange, In return for which he makes a\npeculiar sound, like the rumbling of\ndistant thunder, which Anally breaks\nInto a. discordant croak, growing louder\nand louder as he passes on to the next\nhouee.

INVENTIONS.\nVfrm Electrical Device Are Regarded\nwith Distrust by Old-Fa-h-lon.d\nDivert.\nIt is amusing to note the scorn of\npractical divers for the nice electric-\nlighting and telephone contrivance of\ndivers who never dive, but sell their in\nventlons to the government for its New\nport diving school, which same inven\ntions remain, for the most part, in their\nspick-span boxes. It seems simple\nenough to have submarine lights; yet\ndivers who dive prefer to grope In the al\nmost darkness of our ordinary, waters,\n(t seems a distinct advantage that diver\nand tender be able to talk over a wire;\nyet divers who dive keep Jealously to the\nclumsy system of jerks on the lines, and\nwill not even be bothered with the Morse\nalphabet. The fact is, writes Cleveland\nMoffet, In "Careers of Danger and Dar\ning," a diver has quite as much as he can\nattend to with the burden of his suit\n(about 175 pounds), and his two line\nto watch and keep from kinks and en\ntanglements. Touch one of these lines,\nand you touch his life. Fasten a new\nline to him. or two new lines, and you\nenormously Increase his peril. Imaglrt\nyourself stumbling about In a dark for\nest, with a man strapped on your back,\nand several ropes dragging behind you\namong tr6es and rooks, each separate\nrope being to you as breath and Wood! .\nThat is precisely the diver\'s case. So\nhe goer, so he works. And when they\noffer him pret\'y apparatus to Increase\nhis load, he will have none of It. Nor\nwill he tug any extra ropes. "I have wayp\nenough of dying as It is," says he.\nWorking thus In gloom or darkness\nthe diver develops his senses of feeling\nand locality. He gains certain quali\nties of blind men. and finds guidance In\nunlooled-for ways. The ascending bub\nbies from his helmet, for instance, shin!\nsilver white and may be seen for a couple\nof fathoms. , These bubbles have a trick\nof lodging In a vessel\'s seamc, and so\ngive the diver a rough pattern of her\nAgain, in searching for leaks, the sense\nof hearing helps him. for he can distin\ngulsh .after long habit) the sucking\nmind of water rushing through the\nBoles.\nOne Is sorry to learn that divers so\nto pieces early; tew of them last be\nyond 50. As they grow old their keen\nness wanes; they lose their bearings\neasily down below, and show bad Judg\nment. And fear of the business grows\nnpon hm. Often\' they-seek false cour\nage In strong drink, which hurries on the\nend. Too may of them, after search\ning all their lives for Wrecks, wind up\nas wrecks themselves. But it Is good to\nknow that there are exceptions divers\nlike Bill Atkinson, sturdy and truo at 50,\nand good In the suit for years to eome,\nUnless their W ives persuade them to re\ntire. The diver\'s wife, I am told poor\nwoman slarts with terror every time\nt-he hear a a door bell ring.\nTRACKLESS TROLLEY LINE.\nNovel Road in Prussia to Take the\nPlace of Horses in Hauling\nFarm Products.\nA trackless trolley line is being built\nby the community of Monnheim, to be\nthe first of its kind In Prussia, says the\nElectrical World. It will run from\nMonnheim to Langenfeld, and will be\nabout 2 miles long, with two short\nbranches intended for freighting pur\nposes. 1 he roadway irom Monnneim\nto Langenfeld is about 23 feet wide,\nwith a good basaltic cover about 15 feet\nIn width, running almost in an air line,\nwith the Exception of a few curves. A\npedal contrivance for coupling will be\nrjrovided in order io keep an exact rut\nof ell the cars. The power will be con\nducted to and from the cars by means of\ntwo rotary poles, placed on top of the\nrars. and sliding blocks enabling the\ntrain to give way from 10 to 12 feet. For\nentering farmyards lying tloe to the\nroad there will be tired. Instead of the\nrfgular wire, a fOflmctor and flexible\ncable 0 feet to 70 feet in length, by\nmeans of whi h the current will be trans\nmitted lo the motor car. The trains wlil\nronsist of an electric locomotive for\ndrawing two or thrcerars. driven by two\nelectric motors of from 25-horse power\nto 4n-horse power. The conducting crew\nwill hae its place on the locomotive.\nIhe tars for vwirrylng freight have a\ncapacity of about five tons. Some of the\ncars wii be opn and some closed, and\nall will be fitted with brakes. Coupling\nwill be provided for attaching farm\nwagons.\nroiYSirc:Eii7r.\nCere Cel4 FTereirfii Pneeiree\'e,\nFor m at IVerne\'e Pruj 5; ore.\nS j . uVuliiiuOlj WL-AU & . j\nr ! i i XT, 1 I\nW\nV\nJACKSOil BROS.\nare selling\nSugar, 18 lbs. 1.00\nFresh Vegetables, Fresh\nFrtiits, all kinds of Coun\ntry Prpdnde.
