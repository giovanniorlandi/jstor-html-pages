One does not have to be the\nseventh son of n seventh son to\nprophesy that with entire confidence.\nBut the prophet who ventures further\n-m- ~~~ 1*- likely soon to be without honor\nabroad as well hY in Ids own country.\nSuppose Untie Sam had a Department of Proph\necy at Washington or a United States Commission\nf l’rpphtts or something of the kind. And sup\npose It was the function of said department or\ncommission on .January 1 of each year accurately\n\'.o foretell i lie events of the coming twelve months,\nit home and abroad. Well, the cabinet member\nAt the head of that department or the chairman\nof the commission or whoever was the boss proph\net responsible for the forecast would be walking\nthe floor Just about now with drops of agony on\nIds brow, wouldn’t he? He would.\nAnd If he were u wise prophet, wouldn\'t be drop\neverything, look at the office door and put up a\nsign:\nGone to the tall timber. Closed for repairs.\nHe would. For a wise prophet would know that\nwhat was needed in that office was not prophets,\nbut puzzle experts. For ail the world, at home\nand abroad, would appear to be one vast puzzle\nmade up of smaller ones and still smulter ones\nad Infinitum. Yea; what is wanted are puzzle\nexperts with the ability to unscramble scrambled\neggs If a world of scrambled eggs can be Jtn\nagined, It Is this well-known and Justly-fameus\nEarth at the beginning of 11)24.\nThere is, of course, plenty anil to spare of peo\nple who think they know nil about this scrambled\nworld and believe they are able to unscramble It.\nNo less than 22/ttA people applied for the SIOO,OOO\noffered by Edward \\V. Bok for the best "practicable\nplan by Which the United .States may co-operate\nwith other nations to achieve and preserve the\npeace of the world.” Since this Is a free-for all\ncontest, these *elf-constlluted exjierts represent nil\nkinds of men and women; the statesman with ex\nperience m international affairs; the financier In\ntouch with the world’s money markets; the journal\nist, with tmfnod power of world-wide observation\nthe peaceloving woman to whom war is a crime;\nthe patriotic mother who gives her sons to the\nnation in its time of need; the idealist: the dream\ner—the variety among the applicants fur the\nmoney Is os great as that among their plans.\nTo many—at least in theory as patriotic, as able\nns exporiem-ed—enduring work!! peace seems an\nIridescent dream, as Senator Ingalls of the vitri\nolic tongue said of,honesty ip politics.\nIt would be wrong, nevertheless, to ridicule\neither the plan or Hit contestants. Ro|h/*hould\nho commended. The plan affords the atmosphere\nIn which truth and right ;m* to be found; skepti\ncism and cynicism do mu. Health and honesty are\nthe normal state of man ami his desire is toward\npeace. If Is not impossible that nations may he\ninduced to think and feel as *!••:•$ the individual\ncitizen. The international discussion that is sure\nto follow the announcement of the winning plan\nshould prove a valuable education to those who\nfeineerel.v and intelligently follow It.

Is not mixed up In the ambitions,\nhates and plots of alien peoples. Some of those\nwho would have the United States enter the for\neign chaos with a free hand, a long purse.and a\nbig stick may learn the constitutional limitations\ntinder which the United States must act.\nAnd, bulking large on the horizon, are always\nthe two great questions: TO what extent should\nthe United States be held responsible for the pence\nof the world? Is It for the best interests of the\nAmerican people that the United States should\nenter actively into international politics?\nPatriotic, able and influential Americans hold\n\' diametrically opposite views on these subjects, as\non every one of the subjects of the many puzzles\nwithin the vast world-wide puzzle. One American\nstatesman says:\n. . . We turned our backs upon our associates,\nrefused to bear any responsible-part In the admin\nistration of peace or the firm and permanent estab\n, iishment of the results of the war won ut so terrible\na cost of life and treasure, and withdrew Into a\nsullen and selfish isolation which In deeply igrnobte,\nbecause manifestly -owardly and dishonorable.\nAnother American statesman —of the same polltl\n; cal party—says in answer:\n, i deny that America played an ignoble part be\nfore. during or since the war. I assert the noblest\npage of history ever written Is the story of\nI America’s part, before, during and since the war.\n1 Much is add and written in favor of “hands .\nacross the sea”—a union of America and Great\n\' Britain that shall tell all the rest of the world to\n1 Iw good jjiui see that It does behave. It Is Inter\nesting to note in this connection that Russia has\na dictator Benin, who says that when the Reds\nget the SJJper hand the bourgeoisie of America\nwill pm a heavy price. Turkey has a dictntor,\nI’asbu. who is charged wltn hav\ning promise of good behavior and\nevery gnaftJfffeiv&o American missionaries and to\n• c t,tjjiilstians.

The World court and\nthe child labor amendment have right of way, ac\ncording to the Joint committee.\nIn the meantime, Mrs. O. IT. P. Belmont, presi\ndent of the National Woman’s party, Is predict\ning a third party In 1924 —with a woman candidate\nfor president—in case neither of the major parties\nreceives the etpi.nl. rights amendment with favor.\nHoy, page Mr. Prophet again!\nMrs. Belmont and her cohorts will have to hurry\nthings or they will find themselves the fourth par\nty, instead of the third. For the call for a nom\ninating convention in May has gone forth and\nIts keynote is the "abolishment of speclul priv\nilege." By "special privilege" Is meant "the un\njust economic advantage by possession of which\na small group controls our national resources,\ntransportation, Industry and credit, stifles compe\ntition, prevents opportunity for development of\nall, and thus delates conditions under which we\nlive.”\nHere’s a real job for the puzzle expert. Who\nwill head this party? How Is this "special priv\nilege" to be abolished? How is this "small group"\nty be Identified? And what will be done to them\nfor "dictating the conditions under which we live?"\nAnyway, they should not be boiled In oil or any\nthing like that, for on the whole the conditions j\nunder which we live might be worse. If 83,000 of .\nus want to see a prize tight and are willing to pay\nsomething like a million and a quarter dollars for j\nthe privilege, they let us. They let us own about\n14,000,000 motor vehicles and bum all the gasoline\nwe want to pay for. They let us crowd the movies\nand make the high-fare railroad trains run in sec* \'\ntions. They offer no objection when we Increase\ndeposits in savings banks by $300,000,000. running\nthe total up to seventeen billion. They have al\nlowed the establishment of fifteen new working- *\nmen’s banks in the last three years with resources\nof $43,000,000. They are letting workingmen in\nvest millions in the business of their employers.\nThey allowed workingmen last year to send back\n$400,000,000 to friends and relatives In Europe. f\nWhy, they even allow the women of the country ,\nto spend a million and a half on hair nets. So\ndown with this special privilege that so controls\nour industry and credit and dictates these rigor\nous conditions of existence!\nHere is one thing which might be a puzzle, but is \'\nnot: Approximately 50,000 of California’s Jap\nanese ore planning to migrate eastward or return\nto Japnn. as a result of the United States Su- |\npreme court’s decision upholding the state\'s alien\nland laws. Nearly a million and a half of the\nrichest agricultural lands of the state, now lense.l ;\nto Japanese, retitrned to white owners, i\nIt Is a heavy Japanese. Of California\'s\nenormous vegetable Jfnd fruit Industry, more than\n80 per cent has been for ten years controlled by J\nJapanese. Naturally the Japanese government 1\ndoe* not like this; the Japanese press reflects its\nfeelings and those of the Japanese people. But\nwhatever Japan may this wholesale ban- f\nisbraent of her nationals there will be no "Yellow\nPeril" In 1924 or for many years to come.\nTheoretically, of course, on New Year’s Day all\nthe world is going to swear\' off, turn over a new i\nleaf, and make good resolutions and live up to\nthem. Everybody is going to pay his debts, quit j\nquarreling with his neighbors und act like a gen-\ntleman. In theory 1924 will begin business with i\nhuman nature reformed and the Gohlen Rule in\nfull operation. And ns with men. so with nations.\nIt should be so. Else the Grim Reai*r may And\nus unprepared. "In the midst of life we are In\ndeath." A few months ago the kindly* jjjutleimtn\nand sincere patriot at the head of tiihr§^>ut.na\ntion was alive and well.

December 3s, 1938,\nTHE NEW YEAR.\nBefore another issue of the Inde\npendent reaches the hands of our\nreaders a new year will have\ndawned. While looking forward to\na greater and better future, we\npause to cast a retrospect over the\npast and ask, What will 1924 bring?\nThis, no man knows, and it is one\nof the blessings of life that he does\nnot. If we could see through, the\nveil, we would face much unhappi\nness, much anxiety. The year we\nhave just entered is a closed book,\nto be opened page by page, and\nthere are many possibilities in the\nfuture.\nNot in many respects will the\nnew year differ from those of the\npast.\nThe future must look brighter for\nall mankind. Problems are to be\nsolved still, and dangers are now in\nevidence. But men are sincerely\nhopeful of solution of the problems\nand avoidance of the dangers.\nToo often ye approach the open-\nanolher period \'Of "time in a\npersonal spirit, with hopes for in\ndividual advantage, or apprehen\nsions of direct and localized mis\nfortune. It is necessary to view the\nprospect broadly. Is society ad\nvancing towards higher ideals and\nbetter conditions of life? Only the\nchronic pessimist, with no substan\ntial basis for his bilious outlook, will\ndeny the affirmative answer.\nCast back the vision into the past\nand see how far ahead we are than\neven a few decades ago! We have\nbetter chances for life, better ad\nvantages for advancement, better\nconditions of home comfort, better\nopportunities for our children, bet\nter government, better morals. We\nare living in a cleaner time, with a\ngreater number of people on a ris\ning plane of social relationship.\nThere is more charity, there is more\njustice, there is more human sym\npathy.\nNineteen-twenty-four! A year\nof promise and wonderful possi\nbilities! Let us greet it gladly and\ncheerfully and confidently! And let\nus not forget that in the main we\nmake our own year what it proves\nto be, a year of blessings or a year\nof sorrows, according as we ap\nproach our tasks and responsibilities\nand opportunities.\nWe extend our readers and the\npeople of Charles County our best\nwishes for a Happy and Prosperous\nNew Year and hope that every\nblessing and success may flow\nabundantly upon one and all.\nENTER JIM REED.\n- Senator Jim Reed, of Missouri,\nfor whose picturesque methods most\nof us, if we are honest, will confess\na fondness, has introduced a reso\nlution into the Senate calling for an\ninvestigation into the “organized ef\nfort being made to control public\nopinion and the action of Congress\'’\nupon the soldier bonus.\nSenator Reed\'s resolution, by a\ncurious chance, comes at the same\nmoment as the first faint rumblings\nof his Presidential boom. The wise\nobserver of public affairs will not\nbe blind to the possible connection\nbetween the two. Say what you will\nagainst Jim Reed, you can’t accuse\nhim of being ignorant of the value\nof first-page publicity.\nBut if we ignore, for the moment,\nthe deep-laid plans of the eminent\nMissourian to keep before the pub\nlic and consider his anti-bonus\npropaganda resolution on its merits,\nwe shall find that there is much to\nbe said in its favor.\nRoughly speaking, the people in\nthis country divide themselves into\ntwo classes. There are, in the first\nplace, those who believe that the\nFederal Government is an inex\nhaustible miife of wealth, to be\ntapped at will for the benefit of the\nclass or group which happens to get\nthe ear of Congress. These same\npeople, it happens, are the people\nwho believe in more laws, more\ntaxes, and of course in more job\nholders.\nThen there is another group.\nThis group knows that the money\nin the public treasury is not grown\nthere, nor does it spring, freshly\nminted, out of the ground. But\nrather it is taken, every cent of it,\nout of the pockets of the taxpayers.\nAnd, acting on this knowledge, the\nsecond group is inclined to oppose\nthe passage of laws which add to the\nnumber of jobholders, increase the\ntotal burden of taxation, decrease\nthe liberties of the individual and\nadd to the numbers and powers of\nthe jobholders.\nThe second group unfortunately\ndoes not often get a chance to be\nheard. The time of Congress is\nusually taken up with considering\nthe arguments of those who demand\nnew laws, more taxes and more job\nholders.\nAlthough Senator Reed may not\nthink so, his resolution appears to\nprovide the opportunity needed by\nthe opponents of high taxes and\nmore laws and more jobholders to\nget their case before the public. On -\nthat score we hope he will fight it\nthiough, and that the investigation\nis held with all the beating of drums\nand sounding of trumpets that he\ncan encompass,—Baltimore News. I\nWoJwe always advocated .-\nLaxion of farmers, as we believe (\nthere is no other way for them to <.\nexert the influence needed for the t\nprotection of their business. Here- r\nto fore all efforts among our county\nfarmers have been confined to an\norganization of tobacco growers,\nwhich, we believe, has already pro\nduced good results, with prospect\nfor fuller accomplishment, notwith\nstanding the many unfavorable and\nstubborn obstacles it had to meet.\nThis, however, is but one of the\nmany local organizations that is lim\nited to one branch of agriculture\nonly and therefore limited in its in* ’\nfluence on the general agricultural\nsituation. The Farm Bureau, how\never, is an organization that is\nsought to be made nation-wide in\nits scope and general in its influence.\nDuring the week agents of the\nFarm Bureau have been canvassing\nthe couftty securing memberships,\nand they are rather pleased with the\nresponse on the part of our farm\ners. Unfortunately, farmers are\nslew to inform themselves as to the\nobject and purpose of such organi\nzations, and not understanding the\npurpose, are slow to affiliate with\nthem. The object of the Farm Bu\nreau is to plant or form local or\nganizations or units in every com\nmunity, which units form county j\nunits, they in turn compose State\nwide organizations that in turn are)\nformed into the Nation-wide Bu\nreau. Its purpose will be to advance\nthe interest of the farmer in all\nbranches through a consolidated and\ninfluential organization. Calvert\nJournal.\nChristmas!

SIMMS,\nBel Alton, Maryland.\nWHY THE TELEPHONE\nCOMPANY ADVERTISES\nSometimes the question is\nasked, “Since telephones are to\nbe found everywhere and every\nbody uses telephone service,\nwhy does the Telephone Com\npany advertise?”\nHere is our answer: Tele\nphone service is personal ser\nvice ; it is the most personal of\nall public services. Through its\narmy of employees the Tele\nphone Company is in constant\ndirect contact with those it\nserves. Such a contact could\nnot possibly yield the best re\nsults without the heartiest co\noperation of our patrons and\nthis cooperation can only be ob\ntained when there is a mutual\nunderstanding.\nWe seek to bring about this\nunderstanding through our ad\nvertising in which we inform\nour patrons about our business;\nexplain how our regulations,\nmethods and practices are de\nsigned to help the .service; tell\nor the closing dates of direc\ntories; announce proposed ex\ntensions of the system, new\nclasses of service, and changes\nin existing classes; —in short,\nkeep our patrons thoroughly\nposted in all of the matters that\naffect the Company’s relations\nwith them.\nIn this way we seek to create\nin the minds of those we serve\nan understanding of our prob\nlems, confidence in our honesty\nof purpose, and faith in our aim\nto give the best service possible.\n-All of these things are necessary\nto secure for us that measure of\ncooperation which we consider\nvital to the successful operation\nof our service.\nThe Chesapeake and Potomac\nTelephone Company\n"Bell Syetem "\nC..c Policy - Ono System .

Welles Corporation\nof New York, for an 11,000-acre tract\nof land between White Plains and Wal\ndorf, Charles county, colonization of\nsouthern Maryland by farmers\' families\ncoming chiefly from Germany, Norway\nand Sweden has been undertaken. The\nsame corporation :s said to be trying to\nget a tract of equal sibe in Prince\nGeorges, Calvert or St Marys county.\nThe Charles County tract is one the Popes\nCieek branch ot me Pennsylvania Rail\nroad. Any tract which might be bought\nin Prince George or Calvert county,\nwould be served ny the proposed route oi\nthe Drum Point Railroad, irom Millers\nviilc to Solomons Island.\nA commission, of which Keith Compton\nof the Baltimore paving commission is\nchairman, now is considering a plan by\nwhich the counties would aid in the con\nstruction of the road and will report to\nGov.

Welles corpora\ntion of New York by which it will take\nover any pay and for not less thafl* 1,300\nacres of the tract in question every six\nmonths.\n“The Farms Company has a paid-up\nstock of $250,000. I cannot say just what\nthe price at which we have agreed to\nsell the 1 1,000-acde tract is but it is J\nsufficient to give us interest at 6 per\ncent for the period during which the land\nhas been held. I understand the Welles\nCorporation expects to have 100 families\non the land by April 1 next.

It is said that the commission\non the Drum Point road will meet short\nly after the first of the year. Mr. Par\nran and other southern Marylanders have\nbeen invited to appeal be/orc it. At a\nmeeting of the executive committee of\nthe commission to be held before the con\nference of the general committee it is\nexpected that representatives of the\nWashington, Baltimore and Annapolis\nElectric railway, of the Baltimore and\nOhio and of the Pennsylvania railroad\nwill appear.\nThe present plan, it is said, is to build\na road from Millersville on the W. B. &\nA. line to Drum Point, Calvert county.\n“It has been found,” said Mr. Comp\nton. “that the Maryland constitution for\nbids the state to make appropriations to\naid in constructing such a road, but there\nis no bar to prevent counties from float\ning bonds for that purpose. Two of the\ncounties already have the authority to\nissue such bonds.”\nFord Tudor Sedan.\nThe Ford Tudor Sedan brings to the\npublic an entirely new style of Ford\nenclosed body.\nIt is a distinctive type designed to\ncarry five passengers in complete com\nfort.

This device\ncontrols not only the announcer’s\nmicrophone but the broadcasting op\nerations for three stations.\nThe announcer for WBAF l seated\nbefore a mahogany desk upon which\nstands a complex switchboard. Code\nletters indicate the function of each\nof the numerous cam switches. It is\nthe. nerve center of the station, pro\nviding for the gathering of programs\nfrom many points and their distribu\ntion through stations in New York,\nWashington, D. C„ and Providence,\n‘R. 1., and also additional point# on\n■pedal occasions.\nThe programs for WEAF are ren\ndered not only at many different\npoints, such\' as theatres, hotels and\nauditoriums, but are also distributed\nto several broadcasting stations. Oc\ncasionally special programs are ren\ndered from one particular station\nwhile another program Is rendered for\nthe other two.\nSwitches on the announcer\'s switch\nboard panel provide for the many\ncomplex operations necessary to cover\nand exchange these programs os de\nsired. For instance, w&hn WEAF’S\nannouncer states "the next voice you\nwill hear is our announcer at Kansas\nCity, who will introduce the speaker\nof the evening," he himself operates\na cam switch which transfers the pro\ngram to the distant city.\nAdded to the task of controlling the\n•ource and distribution of programs,\nhe has the complex task of announc\ning for several stations simultaneous\nly. He switches his own announcing\nmicrophone so that hie words are\nradiated only through the Chesapeake\nand Potomac Telephone Company,\nWJAR. Providence, R. 1., or WCAP.\nWashington, D. C., or WEAF singly\nor any combination of two or all three\nsimultaneously as required by the\ncharacter of the announcement.\nThe switching arrangements sug\ngest something of the character which\nradio broadcasting may assume In the\nfuture. It may he that several pro\ngrams will be rendered at different\npoints and supplied to a switchboard\nwhere they will be routed and re\nrouted and interchanged to local and\ndistant stations as ordered by pro\ngram managers. In this way, each\nstation, no matter what its location,\nmay balance Its program according to\nthe local requirements and be certain\nof the highest grade of talent.\n“Selling” Telephone ToWash\nington Wasn’t Easy.\nWhen George C. Maynard Introduced\nthe telephone into the city of Wash\nington in 1877 and 1878, Pennsylvania\navenue was not lined oh both sides\nwith crowds waiting to see him and to\nhail the coming of a new day for the\nmethods of work and government and\nsocial life in the capital of the coun\ntry. The telephone had to talk its\nway into the residences and the offices\nof this community as of every other.\nMr. Maynard circularised the city, and\nthen had a solicitor, Warden Choate,\nhelp him call on possible subscribers\nindividually. This was during the ad\nministration of President Rutherford\nB. Hayes. One of Mr. Choate\'s daily\nreports to his chief gives a very vivid\nidea of what the Introduction of the\ntelephone Into Washington really was\n: like.\n“Executive Mansion; not in.

Here- tw\ntoforc all efforts among our county\nfarmers have been confined to an\norganization of tobacco growers,\nwhich, we believe, has already pro- i\nduced good results, with prospect\nfor fuller accomplishment, notwith\nstanding the many unfavorable and (\nstubborn obstacles it had to meet.\nThis, however, is but one of the\nmany local organizations that is lim- •\nited to one branch of agriculture\nonly and therefore limited in its in* ~\nfluence on the general agricultural •\nsituation. The Farm Bureau, how\never, is an organization that is\nsought to be made nation-wide in\nits scope and general in its influence.\nDuring the week agents of the\nFarm Bureau have been canvassing\nthe courtty securing memberships,\nand they are rather pleased with the\nresponse on the part of our farm\ners. Unfortunately, farmers are\nslow to inform themselves as to the\nobject and purpose of such organi\nzations, and not understanding the\npurpose, are slow to affiliate with t\nthem. The object of the Farm Bu\nreau is to plant or form local or\nganizations or units in every com\nmunity, which units form county\nunits, they in turn compose State\nwide organizations that in turn are\nformed into the Nation-wide Bu\nreau. Its purpose will be to advance\nthe interest of the farmer in all\nbranches through a consolidated and\ninfluential organization.

The greatest\n: depreciation, however. Is the result of\n; rot and rust, which takes place when\nImplements are left standing lir~fence\ncorners or In fields exposed to the ele\n, raents, such ns moisture, freezing.\n’ \'hawing and the hot sun.

Vast agricultural tructs that\nsprawl out from Winnipeg to the\nRockies are becoming a network of\nroads that stretch like thin white rib\nbons to the horizon.\nCanada believes that good roads are\na first essential of rapid agricultural\nand industrial expansion, writes Ed\nward Jerome Dies in the Illustrated\nWorld. The Canadian government,\naccordingly, has appropriated $20,000,*\n000 to be used in construction of main\n| highways and market roads. U is to\nj cover operations for five years. Under\ni the terms provinces Initiate and carry\n; out the road building, and the Domin\nion government, on npprovnl of the\nJ plans, contributes 40 per cent of lhe\ncost. This guarantees standardization\nJ of roadways and places only 60 per\nI cent of the expense on the provinces.\n| Results nre most gratifying,\nj The general campaign includes In\n\' fernutlanal automobile roads which\nwill cement even more closely the\ntrade relations between the United\nStates nnd Canada. A highway from\nOttawa to Sarnia, across the river to\nPort Huron, where the Victory high\nway cuts through Michlgnn, is being\nlaid out by the Ontario Highway asso\nciation. This links up with the Lin\ncoln highway, which crosses the Jef\nferson highway near Ames, la. The\nJefferson highway runs from New Or\nleans to Winnipeg, “the trail from the\npines to the palms."\nFrom Winnipeg a boulevard high\nway Is to stretch to points in North\nDakota and Minnesota nnd across the\nMississippi valley. Another Interna\ntional road will connect Alberta and\nMontana.\nScours in Young Calves\nCaused by Indigestion\nOrdinary scours In young calves are\ncaused by indigestion. Either your\ncalf has been getting too much milk\nor the milk is too rich in fat. The best\ntreatment for scours In young calves\nIs to reduce the feed. Do not let tha\ncalf have all the milk It will drink, and\nlet It drink several times a day. Give\ni the calf about two ounces of castor oil\n| to clean the bowels.\nAccumulation of Leaves\nShelters Many Insects\nThe accumulation of leaves nnd\ni rubbish under hedges and in brash\nj land offers Ideal shelter for many ln\nj jurious Insects during the winter.\n! Plans should, be made to clean these\n| areas tip early this winter. Late \\tfn\ni ter and early spring burning of grass\n| land is not as effective in chinch bug\nj control as fall and early winter.\nFruits and Vegetables\nAre Fine for Chickens\nIt Is very little trouble to save the\n: parings from fruits and vegetables\n; until a sufficient quantity is saved to\n| cook for the chickens. Cooked until\n! soft and thickened w ith bran or mash,\ni and a small quantity of red pepper\nadded, they form a fine appetizer and\n‘are the means of putting more eggs\n; into the basket.\nProfitable Dairying Is\nBased on Alfalfa Crop\nProfitable dairying is based upon\nalfalfa In aiany cases because con\nsiderable protein and lime are needed\nin milk production For high pro\nducing cows grain is needed even\nwhen alfalfa is fed, but the feeding\nof alfalfa will reduce the grain re\nquired.\nMake Spring Work Easy.\nIf a part of the land for spring crops\nIs winter plowed or listed, the spring j\nwork can be done better.

And the\nuse of this won!\nimplies an effort to rednee to the last\nfraction or else to entirely eliminate\ndoubt as to the worth of the thing or\nthe person considered. Allowing that\nthey were commendable, now we rec\nommend them. And now, God’s love\nIs upon us and he has commended It.\nWhen the mother appeared before\nthe Judge to request that her son\'s\npenalty of a life-term imprisonment\nmight insteud he hers so that the boy\nmight go free at the price of her suf\nfering. that request commended her\nmother-love. There wns the love, and\nthere was added the act that said:\n“Here is an exhibition of my love."\nSimilarly, hut with Infinite range of\nmeaning, God commendeth His love\ntoward us In that while we were yet\nsinners Christ died for us. There had\nbeen the holy out-going of God’s heart\nbut the death of our Lord Jesus ex\nhibited and urged it upon the attention\nof sinful man. Not before the Cross\ncould the words have been received\nso absolutely,\nO Love, that will not let me go.\nIt Is as If, up to Calvary\'s Cross\nGod called, God sought, God pleaded,\nhut when the cry went forth from the\nCross, “It Is finished," God claimed.\nHave you considered those words\n“made manifest" and “the appearing"\nIn the first chapter of the second epistle\nto Timothy? There we are told that\nbefore the ages began God s purpose\nand grace were in Christ Jesus; but\nwith His blessed mission on earth they\nwere "made manifest" and so made\nbecause of His "appearing." This fact\ndates for us a new world in which to\nUve. For, there was love talking, love\nwalking, love sighing, love weeping,\nlove thirsting, love groaning, love tast\ning death for ns—suffering love, be\nseeching redeeming love, exhibited be\nfore the gaze of sinners. Obscurity\nthen gave way to manifestation. As\nhe said: “I am come a light Into the\nworld." Never thereafter may sinful\nman make the plea that love (the love\nof God) is not manifestly apparent.\nIn part, It may be due, too, to the\ncrowding forces of affliction and trial\nthat God Ims planned to so enlarge\nthe manifestation of his love toward\nus. Blinded by the fury of the blight\nand ihe pest aud the palu men cried\nfor the flesh-pots of Egypt. But now.\nbeholding what Love has offered from\nCalvary how sinful the sin that would\ncharge God with harshness or forget\nfulness because of the rage of the con\nflict that engages men. In short, look\nat the Cross, really look there, and\nyou do not see the blight; live beneath\nthe (.\'rose and you do not feel the\nstorm; accept the Cross and nowhere\nU there left on all the surrounding\nheld the sign of defeat. For, there is\nlove —love over the blight, love In the\nstorm, love mightier than the foe; love\nso manifest and apparent that they\ncannot appear as before, in its light.\nIt is no extreme Imagining that an\nnounces :\nO Cross, that lifted up my head.\nNo, for the crouching and the dis\nheartened droop cannot be when the\nheart sees the Cross as it is. It ao\ncommends God\'s love that we reason\nably exclaim: “He that spared not\nHis own Son but freely gave Him up\nfor us all, how shall He not with Him\nalso freely give us all things.”\nAh, yes, and this love of God is\ncommended, not because Jesus died\non the Cross for the good or the worthy\nbut, “In that while we were yet sin\nners Christ died for us.” God’s love\napparent to unfallen angels would be\neasily accepted as a fact compared\nwith this. This is so astonishing thut\nHe commends it. Christ Jesus \'‘came\nto seek and to save that which was\nlost." "Christ Jesus came into the\nworld to save sinners.” The saved\nnmn sees it, yet it la never his to claim\nthat the slightest goodness or* merit\nof his own part could have brought\nit about Ask him, "Why were you\nsaved?" He must reply: “God loved\nme so.” And he became aware of It\nby believing the message cohcernlng\nwhat Jesus did on the Cross. Search\nthrough the Bible for the plainest com\nment upon the little word “so" in\n‘‘God so loved the world” and see If\nyou do not find it In this very expres\nsion: “God commendeth his love."\nYou will never find the meaning of\nthat little word "so” In John 3:16\noutside the Bible, aud can you Im\nagine any other way to explain God’s\ncommending of His love than to use\nthat little word with infinite mean\nlug? If possible it would appear to\nbe love exhibited as more lovely.
