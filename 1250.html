Three mines are, operated and mining has been in prog, ress for the last thirty years. Most, of the coal is mined from the surface,, as the veins outcrop all along the, inlet. As the upper stratas are re, moved the coal becomes of higher, grade and with scientific methods em, ployed there is n,o doubt that this field ;, will become one of the largest produc-1, ers on Seward peninsula., This year 3,000 sacks were mined,!, 1,000 of which were used by the bu, reau for its local school, 200 tons were, shipped to Point Barrow on the, schooner Holmes. As the Boxer has, been acquired by the bureau it is, planned to take supplies north and re, turn with coal cargoes for other points, along the coast. Nome can well take, advantage of this field of high grade, coal and overcome the present high, ‘(%sN of *Phe* - ’ ♦, The Wainwright inlet is barred by, sand bar which prevents boats of more, than three or four feet draft entering., Down the inlet where the coal is fourifl, within fifty feet from the shore, skin, boats load the fuel and paddle to the, village., According to Mr. Ward, as the de, mand for the coal increases the pres, ent cost of 75 cents per sack can easily, reduced to 50 cents per sack, making, the commercial possibilities much, more feasible.—Nome Nugget., EMPRESS, TONIGHT AND TOMORROW, “BEAU, REVEL”, Featuring, FLORENCE VIDOR, —With—, LLOYD HUGHES AND LEWIS STONE, A THOMAS H.

The ball actually sailed, 90 yards through the air, but count, ing the distance from the club line, scrimmage, it made 80 yards net., It wasn’t a bouncing punt but a, spiritual that soared so high that the, Multnomah ends actually were down, with it as soon as the Gonzaga safe, ty man and he didn’t make a yard., During the same game Steers, again sent the ball flying 80 yards, on another kick but it went out of, bounds and netted him only fifty, yards. Some college kickers are, glad to make 50 yard3 in straighta, way booting., Other historic kicks made by, Steers in the Gonzaga game were, for 60 yards each. In every exchange, of punts he gained from fifteen to, thirty yards., MOVIE, The new Thomas H. Ince-Paramount, picture “Beau Revel,” which will be, shown at the Empress Theater tonight, and tomorrow, is a striking photoplay, of New York’s “four hundred” ably di, rected and acted. It concerns Law, rence Revel, known to the "smart, world as “Beau,” wealthy and fascin, ating., Wishing to break his son’s infatu, ation for Nellie Steele, the proprietor, of an exclusive dancing club, he makes, a compact with him not to see her for, two weeks. He says he will have her, alone in his apartment on midnight of, the last day. When the last day ar, rives Nellie’s brother makes a frantic, appeal to her for money and she has, tens to “Beau’s” apartment for aid., Dick follows her there. Then follows, a highly interesting scene. Florence, Vidor is charming as Nellie, while, Lewis Stone and Lloyd Hughes are, artistic in their roles. In addition to, this picture Johnny Hines in his lat, est Torchy comedy called “Torchy’s, Promotion.” As the lovable office boy,, just promoted to be the big boss’s pri, vate secretary, Torchy gets the big, contract when his tormentor, the new, general manager, thinks he is sending, him on a heart-breaking wild goose, chase after a fictitious “John Brown.”, As an actor, the popular Johnny Hines, is more a winner than ever before., “SLICK” DRY AGENT, FOXES BARTENDERS, WITH CLEVER RUSE, /, CLARKSBURG, W. Va., Nov. 20.—, The interesting information was, brought out at a hearing before, George Harry Gordon, Federal Court, Commissioner, in wjtich Samuel, Slovensky, Baltimore Street mer, chant, was charged with selling, moonshine whiskey, that prohibition, agents, like magicians, are working, hereabouts with a whole bag of, tricks. A prohibition agent, Aremen, ian by birth and having a name, that looks like a scrambled alpha, bet, wjm ,*Uid hean._sf>et hace rfsotji, Washington, told how he had trapped, more than a dozen victims in, Clarksburg by the use of a little, brown ball. He explained that he, would go into a place suspected of, being a “blind tiger,” purchase a, couple of drinks, put them into his, mouth as though gulping them, down, place a handkerchief over his, mouth as though wiping it and suck, the “evidence” from his mouth into, the little brown ball .which is made, of rubber. The agent gave a, demonstration of his dexterity and, amazed the Commissioner, lawyers, and witnesses. None could detect, this filching of the evidence until, he disclosed the little ball in the, handkerchief. After supposedly, drinking the “evidence,” he could, smoke a cigarette with such ease, as to baffle all beholders., NOTICE, On and after November 10, 1922, I, will not be responsible for any debts, | contracted by Mrs. C. 8.

This has been, the history of all progress in America., Applying the situation to Anchorage, unless, some steps is taken to create avenues through, which small industries may grow up, indus, tries of a character calculated to retain within\', the community the two millions of dollars, now trickling outside, there will eventually, arrive the day when the city will lapse into, a rut., There is a golden opportunity m the colon, ization of the railroad belt, and the expendi, ture of a goodly portion of the millions of dol, lars paid out for foodstuffs among producers, in the railroad belt,, Many excuses have been offered for in, activity among the most pronounced being, the charge that farmers would not produce, the materials. Taking the farmer’s side of, the question we find him bound and handi, capped by lack of the agencies through which, to market his products. He raises grain, but, there is no market, save for feeding chickens, and an occasional pig; he raises sheaf oats, and hay only to be told by those handling, outside products that his products are infer, ior—are hard to handle because not baled for, shipment; he raises potatoes, to be told that, they are inferior to the outside product; he, raises cabbages, turnips and kindred products,, to be told that they will not store or keep;, he raises hogs and sheep, to be told that the, ment. is not finished off and cannot compete, with outside products., It is strange no one had thought of estab, lishing marketing agencies and through these, offer avenues through which the agriculturist, might get his products into the hands of con, sumers. Tt is also strange that some steps, have not been taken to stop the drainage of, money to the outside by a combination among, the business men to refuse to handle any but, products grown in this vicinity., The time has not been long sfnce the Alas, kan was willing to accept any kind of farm, product and pay exhorbitant prices for it,, never questioning the quality. It would seem, reasonable that, they should foster infant in, dustry wherein the quality is equal if not su, perior, and at the same time start the cycle, necessary to keep the money in the country., Tt does not require large sums of money to, initiate these things—only co-operation be, tween the agencies of business, the producer, and the consumer, with the consideration »iik, the meantime of creating agencies for the, manufacture of surpluses, such as flour, mill, feed, hay and grain. From this will come, dairying, chicken and bog raising, with ac, cumulations of surplus livestock that will, eventually allow the railroad belt to live off, home produced materials. The time when, these things will happen is gauged by the, alacrity with which the business brains of, the community grapple with the problems, and solve it.—Anchorage Times., A governor on the job in these troublous, times is likely to win more votes than a spell, binder on the stump.—Boston Transcript., There was a heavy fall of snow yesterday, and today, accompanied ■by considerable wind., THE LIVING WAGE, There are some things to be thankful for,, and among others is the fact that a majority, of the Railroad Labor Board understands and, is not afraid to say that the fallacy of the, living wage “if carried to its legitimate con, clusion would wreck every railroad in the, United Stales, and if extended to other in, dustries would carry them into economic, ruin.” That is courage and sense in a senti, mental world, and the pennywise idealism of, Edsel Ford shall not prevail against it. What, is a living wage? Who shall determine it!, Money fluctuations, values change with the, individual need, life is never uniform, the, luxuries of today are the necessities of to, morrow, the very term “necessity” has lost, all meaning, different men need different, things and different ways of life, progress of, the race depends on such variety, and a “liv, ing wage” would never mean the same thing, two months in succession nor to any two, men. Especially it would never mean the, same thing to any two women. In the view, of our amiable sentimentalists, the guaranty, of a living wage would release the human, soul for higher flights. In actuality, it would, do no such thing, for with a living guaran, teed, the majority of men would become un, conscionable slackers, industry would be, wrecked, production would fall to the mini, mum, the nation, through scarcity, would, have to go on short rations, and no soul can, fly high on an empty stomach. Production, is the result of work, on everybody’s part,, capitalist and manager and laborer included., Work is the result of some personal ambi:, tion, a little pride, a microscopic modicum of, altruism which is too small to count and al, ways will be, and about 98 per cent anxiety, and fear. It is sad, but it is so. Tenure of\', employment* old age guaranties, minimum, wage, sure pay enough for “reasonable com, fort,” or a “a home with a garden,” are all, visionary. The Labor Board is right., SOME MORE LESSONS, Sir Reginald McKenna, ex-cliancellor of the, British Exchequer, who was recently in this, country lecturing Americans on international, finance, referred to the protection furnished, by the new tariff law as “splendid isolation.”, “I believe,” said he, “that your experience, in America will he the same as ours—that, the policy of splendid isolation doesn’t work.”, The policy of protection has worked most ef, fectively in the United States, and it is being, adopted by Great Britain wherever British, industries are threatened by foreign compe, tition. British manufacturers are as anxious, for the protection from the cheap products\' of, Germany and other countries where the stand, ard of living is low as are American pro, ducers. Because of the size of her territory, and the density of her population, Great Brit, ain is far more dependent on imports than is, the United States, but “splendid isolation” is, practiced there as here toward those indus, tries that are able to supply the home market:, Things We Think, Hard times beckon seekers of soft snaps., « • *, With nine chances to one against his ever amounting, to anything, as figures prove, occasionally the one child, in the family astonishes folks by making up in achieve, ments fcr the otoher nine failures—and every mother, of them thinks her spoiled chick is the one that will, do it., • * •, Every season is an open one for men-slaying women., • • *, When a dreamer turns does, somebody gets “done.”, • • *, You’ll never catch the goose that lays the golden eggs, if you are afraid to get your feet wet., * * •, If you believe what everybody tells you, you will not, know what anybody tells you., • •, *Th« pomp of ptfvver” requires mental pump of, power., • a m, “Say” gets you to the platform; “do’> gets you up, the stairs., • • •, If it were not for husbands and wives, there would, be no unhappy marriages., * * •, The man who mourns that he is “not understood,” is, understood too well., • • *, Divorces are only common where people are common., • • •, Age is a matter of drug stores., * * *, The difference between a car and a motor car is the, price., • • •, Most troubles are imaginary, but not automobile, troubles., • • *, What any honest workman knows is that if he should, get out of a job he could always make a living by, OFFICE CAT, TNAOC MANN, BY JUNIUS, COPYftlOHT 1921, »Y COU«\'l ALLAN MOM., THOUGHT SO, TOO, Captain Hugging of the Army Air, Service tells about his first trip up, in an airplane.

They feel that, he invaded their field when he re, cently made a speech on the sub, ject, "Have Women Souls?”, The Ambassador took the deca, louge to pieces and laid the pieces, out on the table one by one, played, with the theories of the Ten Com, mandments, and altogether had a, most delightful theological evening., Ambassador Harvey was having, a delightful time. It was his char, acteristic New England satire at its, best. England didn’t know whether, to take mm seriously or not, and, England doesn’t know yet, but Eng, lish clerics are of the opinion that, Ambassadors should confine their, efforts to the fields of diplomacy, and to leave theology strictly alone., “We in England are already grow, ing accustomed to the American, Ambassador\'s habit of hilarious sa, tire,” said Dr. F. W. Norwood, em, inent preacher of the City Temple,, when asked to comment on the Am, bassador’s speech. “We have not, forgotten his startling declaration, that America came, into the war, merely to save her own skin, and,, although not of his race, most of, us felt that he did his countrymen, less than justice., “In the same way we make al, lowances and rather enjoy his buoy, ant question, ‘Have Women Souls?’, We would like to know what Mrs., Harvey haB to say about it., “The Jewish law, like the British, law, does betray rather a preponder, ance of masculine sentiment.

I have not yet met a, woman who had been keen enough, to observe it. No doubt they will, be grateful to Mr. Harvey for point, ing it out., “Most of us believe, nowadays, in, a progressive revelation, and are, not surprised that the Old Testa, emt should fall behind in the ideals, of Christ.

SHOWS GROWTH, OTTAWA, Ont., Nov. 20.—People in, Canada received over half a billion, letters and post cards last year, ac, cording to figures compiled by the, Post Office Department, or an average, of about 66 letters per capita- In ad, dition, the department carried 250,000,, 000 newspapers, 50,000,000 parcels and, 250,000,000 circulars. From the inter, national border to the Arctic circle the, post office handles the correspondence, of the public. The letter mailed at, the frontier post of some newly settled, area in the west receives the same, care as one mailed in the large cities., Inclement weather never retards the, delivery. Twelve thousand post of, fices, or approximately one to every, 700 of Canada’s population are oper, ated. The annual cost of maintain, ing the department is slightly over, $30,000,000.

In the appended section, he explains why this is the case., By Georges Popoff, MOSCOW, Nov. 20,-—Now, what, are the reasons why present-day, Russia knows no Jewish pogroms,, while these atrocious excesses were, the order of the day under the, Czarist regime? They are chiefly, two:, Firstly, a well-defined policy of the, Soviet Government, which combats, all pogroms and agitation with ener, gy and determination., Secondly, the fact, little realized, outside of Russia before the war or, even now, that there has never been, in Russia an antt-Semitism in the, western sense of that term., The farsight and consistency with, which the Soviet Government fights, anti-Jewish propaganda is often ad, mirable. Its first principle is abso, lutely public discussion of all “rit, ual” questions. A case which hap, pened in Moscow shortly before" last, Easter illustrates the methods with, which the Soviet Government always, succeeds in taking the wind out of, the sails of the Jew-baiters., In one of the Moscow asylums for, fugitives from the famine area, one, of those institutions where grown, ups and children die daily by the, dozen, the son of a poor Jewish fu, gitive succumbed to consumption., The boy’s father, not willing that, his son’s body should be thrown, into a mass-grave along with the, other Russian and Tartar children, that had died of starvation, had the, body taken to the cellar of the asy, lum and requested the Jewish com, munity to take charge of the boy’s, funeral. The mayor sent an eighty, year-old grave-digger by the name, •frye\'s, / Delicious, JL Hams and Bacon, THERE IS NO, WASTE, Experts in the art of cooking agree on one thing, namely,, that it pays.to buy the very best. FRYE’S DELICIOUS, HAM and FRYE’S DELICIOUS BACON do not cost any, ‘more in the end than ordinary ham and bacon as there is, no waste—every bit is eaten, every bit relished by the family, That’s because FRYE’S DELICIOUS HAM and FRYE’S, DELICIOUS BACON, just as the name implies, are de-licious., Made from choicest young, corn-fed porkers, produced, under the- (lovernment’s method for preparing hams and, .bacon of the richest and most delicate flavor—FRYE’S, DELICIOUS BRAND HAMS and BACON are the last word, in choice foods., Most good Alaska dealers handle them. If yours does, not we would appreciate being advised of the fact., We urge Alaska housewives to try FRYE’S WILD ROSE, LARD if they want something better than ordinary lard for, cooking and baking. It contains the rich leaf and back fats,, -NOT FOUND IN ORDINARY LARDS., Ask your dealers for, a copy of FRYE’S, DELICIOUS HAM, RECIPES., FRYE & CO., SEATTLE,, WASH., EDITORIAL NOTE, In the next Installment of bis, series of articles on Russia Mr., Popoff contrasts the present at, titude of Russia toward the Jews, with the officially inspired pro, gromistic attitude which existed, under the Czarlst regime. "There, is no Anti-Semitic sentiment now, in Russia,” the correspondent de, clares, and points out that the, people of Russia are no longer, conscious of the artificial line, hitherto drawn between differing, races and creeds., of Moses Hindln to fetch the corpse., As the aged Hlndin, accompanied, by the Russian care-taker of the, fugitive asylum, entered the cellar, he saw numerous rats swarming, over the boy’s body. This prompt, ed the old man to hurry and pack, the body in a sack. Carrying it on, his back, he started by foot on the, way to the Jewish cemetery. No, one could £e found to finance a, more decent funeral for this poor, est of the poor., As the aged grave-digger had, trotted along for some miles his, feet began to hurt, and he decided, to invest his last money in a street, car ride. As he stepped on the car, the sack slipped from his hands,, and the little, naked, rat-bitten body, —, ASK TREATY, TO PRESERVE, SEA MAMMALS, SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20—Fifty, years ago a “lime-juice,” as the big, rigged, sailing vessel of that time, was called, would have to shorten, sail and steer a careful course alone, the South Pacific Coast at certain, seasons if it wanted to avoid de, structive collisions with the Cali, fornia grayback whale. And if the, skipper trained his glass along the, coast line, he probably would see, every exposed rock or seaward shoal, black with elephant and fur seals., Closer in he would note great tor, toises and sea turtles, while above, would wheel the Heermann gull., Such an orgy of destruction has, been loosed, on these soa creatures,, some of them termed by scientists, to be "the biggest animals in the, world,’’ in the last half century,, that there is a campaign on today, to have the State Department negoti, ate treaties with all countries bor, dering on the Pacific to prevent, their absolute extermination., One of the great mammals, Stell, er’s sea cow, already has joined the, Great Auk, the Dodo and other stor, ied creatures of a dead age. In, 1741,- when the exploring ship of, Captain Vitus Bering was wrecked, on the island that bears his name,, the great, sluggish sea cows were, floundering about by Dr. George, William Steller, doctor of the expe, dition. Large herds later were, seen, feeding on the kelp and seaweed, around the nearby Commander Is, lands, and it soon was found that, their meat made an excellent human, food., When the news of the discovery, of Baring Island was made known, to the world several expeditions, were fitted out to hunt the sea, cow. How well they succeeded is, attested in the fact that by 1754,, only 13 years after its discovery,, this great animal, 24 to 30 feet, long and weighing three or four, tons when fully grown, disappeared, from the ocean. Moved by the near, ness of a similar fate for the wal, rus, the elephant seal, the sea otter, and the southern whales, the com, mittee on Conservation of Marine, Life of the Pacific, a part of the, American Association for the ad, vancement of science, has started, the campaign to have the State De, partment act., One hundred years ago, the com, mittee points out, a species o{ fur, seal had extensive breeding rooker, ies on the Farallon Islands and other, islands on the coast line of Cali, fornia and Mexico. More than 200,, 000 of these seal were killed in the, short period between 1808 and 1811, on the Farallons alone, while thou, sands of others were added to the, slaughter on the channel Islands to, the southward. This campaign rlr, “Ritual Murder” Bubble, Quickly Broken by, Government, fell on the tracks., Promptly an excited mob surged, around the old man. Threatening, cries grew general. “The Jews, have slaughtered a Gentile boy!”, | “Kill the old devil!” "Lynch the, damned murdered!” etc. Hundreds, of Jew-baiters hastened to the, scene, and soon the mob grew to, thousands. The whole atmosphere, recalled the long-forgotten Batliss, days, with all the dubious elements, of that memorable ritual murder, trial., Here was all the background of, the old Russia of the Czars, of the, Stolypins, of the pogroms. . . ex, actly as in those days, there were, immediately many to be found who, "had sedn with their own eyes how, the Jews had slaughtered a fchrist, ian child.’’ Wild rumors flew thru, Moscow. In one word, a sentiment, was created which in former days,, with the benevolent assistance of, the police, would have inevitably led, to a monster pogrom of old, ap, proved style., But this incident took a different, course: The militia, which has an, excellent organization, summoned all, those present to come along to the, commissariat to assist in the taking, of the protocol. Then, in the pres, ence of several hundred persons, the, body was examined and identified as, that of a Je,wish boy. Moreover, the, Russian orthodox priest was as, signed to conduct the examination., Thus the whole bubble of a sensa, tional “ritual murder" burst within, half an hour. The immediate pub, lic investigation was the pin that, pricked it., The manner of the, Soviet Gov, ernment’s procedure in this case, may be quite natural in the civil, ized countries. In Russia it is wor, thy of special mention since the, chief weapon of the Czarist Gov, ernment’s pogrom policy always was, exploitation of dubious and the, exploitation of dubious elements,, “with the exclusion of the public.”, The court session which dealt with, the case described above was at, tended by more than a hundred, thousand spectators, ouu mcu was, not the slightest difficulty in es, tablishing the harmlessness of the, incident., tualJy exterminated this species of, seal., Further objections to the whole, sale extermination of whales have, been raised by the sardine fisher, men of Monterrey Bay, California,, who claim that the whales herd the, sardines inshore. Recently the ex, amination of the stomach of a hump, back whale brought into the Moss, Landing whaling station in Monterey, Bay yielded from 1500 to 3000 lbs., of sardines. In the stomach of a, sporm whale was found a ten foot, shark., Due to the failure of the united, States and Great Britain to include, Japan in the treaty of 1892 forbid, ding the killing of seals in the open, sea, the Alaska fur seal was de, creased by nearly 300,000 from 1897, to 1911, according to scientific data., A new fur seal treaty was negoti, ated in 1911, the participating coun, tries being the United States, Great, Britain, Russia and Japan. Since, the time that treaty was made the, herd has increased by nearly 400,, 000. So great has the increase been, that there is a suspicion thatpelagio, or ocean sealing is again going on, against the strict ruling of the, guardian\' nations. It is pointed out, that any nation not signatory to the, treaty may engage in this sort of, sealing atfiong the Alaska herd, and, exterminate it in time if new treat, ies are not drawn up., Under the treaty of 1911 the In, dians of California, Oregon, Wash, ington, British Columbia, and ab, origines of Japan and Russia are, permitted to fish both along the, coast lines and in the ocean, and, it is proposed to regulate this also., FARMER WEARS WEDDING, SUIT FORTY YEARS OLD, YORK, S.

Hamilton, corres, pondent at Atlanta, Georgia, writes I, about the influence of the Ku Klux, Klan on the recent primary elections, in that State, By S. D. WEYER, BERLIN, Nov. 20.—’“God save Rus, sia now that the Germans cannot save, her!” is, in substance, the keynote, of a voluminous plaint in the reaction, ary Deutsche Tageszeitung. “The, story of the former Imperial Russia,”, says the article, “is told in two words:, ‘St. Petersburg’ and ‘Petrograd.’ The, first Emperor Peter built Petersburg,:, called in the Germans, and founded, the great world power that was Rus, sia. Emperor Nicholas II concentrated, upon restricting the activity of Ger, mans within his Empire and, indeed,, declared war upon Germanism in Rus, sia. The result was that Petersburg, became Petrograd and Nicholas—the, last Emperor.”, The rest of the article is devoted to, detailed claims that to the Germans, alone the former Muscovite owed its, might and prosperity and that the, downfall came with the enforced de, cline of “Deutschtum” in Russia., “The Deutschtum^is gone from Rus, sia; Russia is Russian and thus is fin, ished as an indejendent economic, power.”, The writer proceeds to predict that, "Americans and Englishmen, who will, \' have predominance in the reconstruc, tion of Russia, will not work for Russia, as did the Germans. They will work, for themselves and make Russia an, economic colony.”, The only chance that is left to Rus, sia to regain a semblance of inde-!, pendence, the writer believes, is a, revolution of the European proletaria. j, He concludes:, “If there is a revolution in western j, or central Europe the Soviet govern, ment has speculated correctly, but if, it does not come Russia will automati, cally become a capitalistic coloniel, state.”, Breitenstraeter, German heavy, weight champion, has a double who, by his likeness to the boxer often gets, into trouble. He is Friedrich Papen,, who, according to the police, has a, fondness for “beating” his bar bills,, counting upon the sympathy of the, crowds that mistake him for Breiten, straeter, to save him from the police., The other day Papen started a row\', with a bartender when the latter pre, sented him with the bill- He slammed, the door, but the manager came after, him and called a policeman. A mob, quickly collected. Someone called:, “Why, it’s Breitenstraeter!” Promptly, a huge crowd rushed to his aid against, the policeman, who soon received re, inforcements. Many of the "cops”, themselves thought their prisoner was, the champion boxer. After a near, riot he was marched off to th the po, lice station by a strong squad of of, ficers with drawn swords., At the station it was discovered that, the “champ” had only one hand., The reactionary Deutsche Zeitung, rants at what it calls the “sheepish, patienee of the Germans in tolerating, the numerous Allied Commissions,, “living like lords at the expense of the, German taxpayer--” The nationalist, organ skids perilously on the edge of, provocation of a new sabre- rattling, speech by Poincare by quoting an Eng, lishman as saying:, “ ‘If ye had such enemy commissions, in our country they would not dar to, take a thing to eat or drink—for fear, of being poisoned!’”, So frequent and insistent are the al, luring offers of English and American, film concerns to the famous Oberam, tnergau Passion players that, in the, opinion of the community of the, “sacred city,” something had to be j, WRI, has its place in childhood\'s Joys,, and it is good ior grown-nps too., A life-long friend., It’s the sweet that’s good for, teeth and stomachs., It’s the ideal refreshment that, The New P.
