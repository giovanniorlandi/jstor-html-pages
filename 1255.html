They didn\'t knew, however,\nthat Governer Mount\'s position was\nnet a new and untried \'one, nor, did\nthey knew that many years age, when\nBeriaii Magoffin was Governer of\nKentucky, a free Negro was indicted\nfor kidnapping a slave. lie was in\ndicted by a Circuit Court of Kentucky.\nThe Governer of Kentucky made a\nrequisition upon the Governer of\nOhie for the return of the fugitive.\nGoverner Denisen, who was then\nthe Governer, refused te honor the\nrequisition. The state of Keutucky\ninstituted proceedings in the Supreme\nCourt at Washington te compel Gov Gov\nereor Denisen te return the fugitive.\nIssue was joined between the state of\nKentucky and Governer Denisen of\nOhie. The decision of the Court is\nreported in 24 Heward (U. S.) 66,\nand reads as follews:\n"The demand beinp: thus made, the\nact of Congress declares \'that it shall\nbe the duty of the executive authority\nof the state\' te cause the fugitive te be\narrested, and secured and delivered te\nthe agent of the demanding state.\nThe words \'it shall be the duty,\' in\nordinary legislation, implied the as\nsertion of the power te command and\nte coerce obedience. But, looking te\nthe subject matter of this law and the\nrelations which the United States and\nthe several states bear te each ether,\nthe Court is of the opinion the words\n\'it shall be the duty\' were net used as\nmandatory and compulsory, but as\ndeclaratory of the moral duty which\nthis compact created, when Congress\nhad provided the mode of carrying it\ninto execution. The act does net pro\nvide any means te compel the execu\ntion of this duty, nor inflict any pun\nishment for neglect or refusal en the\npart of the executive of the state; nor\nis there any clause or prevision in the\nConstitution which arms the Govern\nment of the United States with this\npower. Indeed, such a power would\nplace every state under the control\nand dominion of the general Govern\nment, even in the administration of\nits internal concerns and reserved\nrights; and we think it clear that the\nFederal Government, under the Con\nstitution, has no power te impose en a\nstate officer, as such, any duty what\never, and compel him te perform it;\nfor if it possessed this power, it might\noverload the officer with duties which\nwould fill up all his time, and disable\nhim from performing his obligations\nte the state, etc. But if the Governer\nrefused te discharge this duty, there\nis no power delegated te the general\nGovernment, either through the judi\ncial department, or any ether depart\nment, te use any coercive means te\ncompel him."\nThus it will be seen that Governer\nMount of Indiana has ample au\ntherity te sustain him in refusing te\nhonor the requisition from the Pre\ntended Governer of Kentucky.\nAnd the little whangdoedles mourn I\nCompare It with ether local papers,\nand then say, if you can, that The Led\nger isn\'t the best, and that It doesn\'t\ngive the most for the money.
