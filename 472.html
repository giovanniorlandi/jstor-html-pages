        <pre>['Haiti\nWhat is Best for Maui\nis Best for the News\nIf you wish Prosperity\nAdvertise in the News\nVOLUME XXI\nWAILUKU, MAUI, T. II., SATURDAY, MAY 2, 1914.\nNUMBER H\nH\nAttempted\nMurder and\nSuicide\nWendesday evening the people\nof Kahului were startled with the\n.report that a murder and a suicide\nhad taken place within the town\nlimits of that peaceful little burg.\nLater the matter simmered down\nto an attempted murder closely fol\nlowed by the suicide of the black\nhearted brute in the case. As the\n-Frenchman had it the mattec oc\ncurred because of the woman at the\nbottom of it.\nIt seems that Sato, formerly a\ntrusted employee of Onishi, the\nwell known Japanese merchant of\nKahului, were on intimate terms\nwith Ochika, a comely Japanese\nwoman and withal a widow, and\nhad had some differences with her,\nof the kind the worldly wise would\ndescribe as a lover\'s quarrel and\nthis had preyed on the mind of\nSato to such an extent, that he\nneglected the interests of his em\nployer so much so, that about two\nmonths ago he was let out because\nof hard times. At which time it\nappears Ochika became weary of\nhis attentions, and curtly advised\nhim to keep away from her, an in\njunction he refused to observe. To\nescape the annoyance of his unde\nsired attentions Ochika proposed to\nremove to Honolulu, a bit of in\nformation she indiscreetly imparted\nto some of her confidential friends.\nWhen Sato became aware of her\nintention he came to upbraid and\nto plea\' with her not to forsake\nhim, but she gave him no comfort\nand it became plain to him that\nshe was going to leave him.\nApparently he brooded over the\nsituation, no job and the woman\nhe loved about ;to abandon him\nand with the help of a plentiful\nsupply of saki, he worked himself\ninto a fit of desperation and re\nsolved to go forth and end all.\nArming himself with a big cane\nknife he hastened to Ochika\'s\nquarters at the hour he knew the\nwoman would be alone. Ochika\nwas sitting down partaking of her\nevening meal at 4:30 p. m. when\nSato walked into her presence, and\nwithout a word aimed a murderous\nstroke with the heavy knife at her\nhead. The hour was well chosen\nfor his devilish deed, the neighbor\nhood, near the Spreckels\' Park,\nwas deserted, and there was no one\nnearby to interfere with his pur\npose. The woman screamed for\nhelp while Sato struck at her with\n\' his big heavy knife again and again\nbut there was no one nearby stout\nhearted enough to come to her help.\nShe threw her bare arms about her\nhead to ward off the stinging\nblows, and the silent evidence of\nintensity of her struggles for life\nare the twenty cuts she received on\nher person, principally about her\nhead, neck, shoulder and arms\n"At last she managed to break\ntftvay from the desperate thug, and\nstill screaming covered with bleed\ning wounds she escaped and found\nshelter in a nearby house, and the\nmurderer probably thinking he had\naccomplished his purpose, cooly\nwalked out into the public road\nand hastened towards the town.\nStill holding the big cane knife,\nnow spotted with blood, with blood\non his clothes and a look of des\nperation in his eyes, some of his\ncountryman on noting his appear\nances told officer Kauwenaole that\nSato must have committed an evil\ndeed. That officer promptly ar\nrested Sato and disarmed him, and\nalso asked what he had done. Sato\nCounty\nBond\nIssue\nThe Democratic County Com\nmittee held a meeting April 18th\nlast and appointed a sub-committee\nconsisting of Messrs. 11. C. Moss\nman, T. B. Lyons, M. K. Keoho\nkalole, P. Cockctt and Dr. Ray\nmond to start a campaign favoring\nthe issuing of County bonds for\npublic improvements as set forth\nin the proclamation made by the\nCounty board of supervisors.\nThe Democratic Committee also\nsent an invitation to the Republi\ncan County Committee to join\nhands with them on the issue.\nThis proposition was submitted to\na special meeting of the Republi\ncan executive committee held Mon\nday last, but the Republican com\nmittee declined to be invited, and\npasged a resolution quoting the\nprecedent established at a former\nplebiscite, when iiolitical organi\nzations refrained from making\ncapital of the issue, and took the\nposition that the Republican com\nmittee "will leave the question en\ntirely and unconditionally to the\ngood judgment of the voters free\nfrom all party consideration or\nparty obligation as republicans or\notherwise."\nWednesday afternoon the demo\ncratic sub-committee met and out\nlined a\' plan of action calling for\nthe sending out of campaign speak\ners who will bring the merits of\nthe matter at issue before the\nvoters. The names of several well\nknown orators arc mentioned as\nlikely to take the stump for\nthe cause.\ncooly stated that he had just kill\ned a woman with the knife.\nOfficer Kauwenaole hurried him\nover to the little lock-up and tele\nphoned to Sheriff Crowell at Wai\nluku of what had taken place, and\nthe prisoner was safe in custody.\nThe sheriff promptly told the officer\nto go and find the woman and\nhastened to the scene with Dr.\nOsmers. They found Ochika was\nbeing attended to by friends and\nthe doctor proceeded to give her the\nneeded medical attention prepara\ntory to removing her to the hospi.\ntal. Officer Kauwenaole then re\nturned to the lock-up to look after\nhis prisoner.- Arriving there the\nofficer found that Sato had twisted\na strip torn from a blanket around\nhis neck had fastened the other\nend to the door and by throwing\nhis body backward had nicely\nStrangled himself to death. The\nofficer undid the noose, let the body\ndown and sent a hurry up call for\nDr. Young, who promptly respond\ned, but found the prisoner was be\nyond help as life was extinct.\nThe woman Ochika was remov\ned to the Malulani hospital, and\nthe physician stated that while the\nwounds were frightful they are not\ndangerous and if there are no com\nplications she will recover.\nAfter her wounds were dressed\nand she had been made as comfort\nable as the conditions would allow,\nshe enquired what had become of\nher lover and would-be assasin,\nSato. When told that Sato was\ndead, she stifled a cry of anguish\nthat rose to her lips.\nIt is reported that tho merchants\nand residents of lower Paia aro to\nbe supplied with electric lights at\nan early date, the plantation fur\nnishing tho juice. This will surely\nbo quite an improvement to tho old\ntown. ,\nNEWS OF WEEK AS TOLD\nBY SPECIAL WIRELESS\nHONOLULU, May 1.

Special ceremony will\nmost of thorn arc fit only for the\nWailuku\nIn Old\nTimes\nThe following article clipped\nfrom the Advertiser of fifty years\nago, is of much interest to Mauians:\nIn ancient times, Wailuku and\nthe neighboring valleys, which arc\nwatered by streams from these\nmountains, were undoubtedly\ndensely peopled, the evidences of\nwhich fact still remain. Of late\nears, however, the population has\nbeen gradually decreasing, although\nno portion of the island is better\nndapted to support a large popula\ntion, and afford it ample means of\nindustry, in cultivating taro, bana\nnas, and sweet potatoes, required\nfor other parts of Maui, where taro\nis raised, as well as for the Hono\nlulu market. Not only these pro\nducts do well here, but sugar-cane\nalso grows with very little carc.and\nields remarkably heavy crops.\nWithout infringing on the land de\nvoted to other staples no less than\nfour hundred acres can be irrigated\nand planted with cane at Wailuku.\nTo take advantage of this open\ning for a sugar mill, about eigh\nteen months ago, several gentle\nmen residing in Honolulu, pur\nchased the landing belonging to the\nlate king, commenced planting,\nand ordered a first class mill from\nBoston, which has arrived, and is\nnow in progress of erection. The\nbuildings, which are also being\nerected, are of stone, and located\non the south bank of the Wailuku\nRiver where a steep descent gives\nsuperior advantages for a mill site,\nThe mill will be driven by water,\nof which the river supplies an abun\ndance. During our visit the wheel,\nwhich is a large and powerful and\novershot wheel with an iron frame\nwas being erected by Mr. Robert\nAndrews. Mr. E. Bailey is the\ngeneral manager of the plantation,\nfand Mr. N. W. Tallant has charge\nof the field operations. About one\nhundred and forty acres belonging\nto the plantation are planted and\ngrowing; besides about one hun\ndred acres belonging to the foreign\ners residing in the village. The\nmill, it is now thought, will be\nready to commence grinding in\nJuly, or about twenty months after\nthe first steps were taken to start\nthe plantation. At present every\nthing looks favorable, not only for\nthe growing crops but for the en\ntire success of the enterprise.\nThe day that we spent in Wai\nluku chanced to be that ot the\nexamination of the English there.\nThe scholars, who were all natives,\nor half-castes assembled at the\nstone church and went through\nwith their exercises with all the\ncredit that could be expected in a\nvillage school of the kind. A some\nwhat novel exhibition closed the\nperformances, which took some if\nnot all of the spectators by surprise\nine examination exercises were\nconcluded, when suddenly an\neffigy was hoisted into the air with\nblock and tackle, amid the shouts\nand hurrahs of the audience. From\nits appearance one was at a loss at\nfirst to guess whom it was intended\nfor, though it bore a striking re\nsemblance to Brother Jonathan\nAll doubt was soon removed, when\nthe whole school rose and com-\n. . .\nmeuccu singing jonn urown s\nBody Lies Mouldering In the\nGrave," with an enthusiasm which\nshowed that they appreciated fun.\nWhen they came to the verse,\n"We\'ll hang Jeff Davis on a\npalmetto tree,"\na gun was fired at the effigy, the\nGood\nClose\nGames\nResults.\nCubs beat Paia, score 2 to 1\nWaikapu beat Kahului, score 9 to B\nSTANDING OF TEAMS.\nP W L Pet.\nA.

He called on\nDr. Osmers for treatment, and\neven though his medical adviser\nand friends insisted that he should\nremain at home in comfort for a\nfew days, at least to get over the\npainful effects Dr. Osmers main\ntains that he must remain on duty,\nso that therefore the physician and\nhis patient are at outs with each\nother and Osmers is still at his post"\nof duty.

The\nhurrahing and deafening applause\nthat followed this tragic execution\nof the arch-rebel, showed that at\nleast the juveniles of Wailuku were\nUnion boys of the right stamp,\nsound on the goose." The inci\ndent served to remove the taint of\nsecession, which the hoisting of\nCaptain Gibson\'s flag in the valley\nthree years ago, cast on the Wai\nlukuans. THEN AND NOW.\nWhen we visited this destrict\nthree years ago, there was not a\nsign of plantation, when now we\nsee four in various stages of com-\npleteness, the Waikapu, Wailuku,\nWaihee and Waiehu. The people\n(mostly natives) occupying the\nvalleys, were then engaged in rais\ning taro in the flats, which perhaps\nyielded a crop worth ten thousand\ndollars. Now nearly a thousand\nacres are waving with cane, which\nwill produce at least one thousand\ntons of sugar annually, worth to\nthe Kingdom one hundred thou\nsand dollars, and this yield may be \'\ndoubled in a few years. All this\nincome will be expended from year\nto year in paying laborers and\nmechanics, erecting mills, stores,\nand villas which will act so much $\nto the wealth and beauty of the \'\ncountry. Blacksmiths, carpenters\nand other artisans are locating in\nthe neighborhood, and find con\nstant employment, and already\nover one hundred foreigners are on\nthe assessment tax rolls of these\ndistricts.\n. . . . -', 'THE MAUI NEWS SATURDAY, MAY 2, 1914.\nTHE MAUI NEVAS\nKahului.

Protectionists believe that "the\ngreatest friend of truth is time." They expect Protection\nprinciples to vindicate themselves. They expect that the\npresent period of Free Trade, like the Free-Trade period of 1 S93-\'97\nwill he sufficient to inform the people of the undesirable consequences\nof departing from safe, sound, practical lines and embarking upon\neconomic experiment based wholly upon theory. Protectionists believe\nthat those who have been persuaded that a Protective Tariff is a fraud\nand a robbery of the consumer will naturally demand speedy relief\nfrom the alleged "burdens" of Protective Tariff laws, and they will\nnot be satisfied with pretexts or excuses for the failure of the party in\npower to bring about a lower cost of living without at the same time\ndiminishing the receipts and the profits of all gainful enterprises and\noccupations, whether of the forge, the factory, the forest, the fishery\nor the farm.\nTo maintain at their present level the spendable incomes of the mass\nes, acquired under Protection, and also to increase the purchasing\npower of such incomes by reducing the cost of living, while\' assuring to\nall labor and production an undiminished increment and reward- to\nthe fanner maximum prices at the farm, and to the wage earner mini\nmum prices for what he has to buy of the fanner\'s products; to the\nfactory worker no less wages than before, but to the consumer a lower\ncost of the factory product; iris to such a contradictory scheme, to so\nincongruous and impossible a result, that the party of Free-Tiade has\ncommitted itself. Of course, it will fail. It will not lower thenrieeof\nthe necessaries of life except as it shall reduce the ability to pay. . Hut\nreduced ability to pay is not what they want.

Stevenson, editor and manager of the Maui Nkws, fo\nn .arly two years, has severed his connection with the paper and will\nhereafter reside in Honolulu. In the past, Mr. Stevenson has proved\nhimself to be an able, fearless and clean minded writer who has, by\nturning the spot light now and again into dark corners, frightened\nthose who were inclined to indulge in little affairs of doubtful propiiety\ninto the more sedate if narrower paths of life. He has made friends\nand foes alike, but none question his integrity. Unfortunately for this\nissue of the Ni.ws, Mr. Stevenson was called away suddenly and left for\nHonolulu last Wednesday intending to return with his successor, Win.\n.f. Cooper today. Unfortunately however, unforseen contingencies have\narisui and he is compelled to renu.in in Honolulu instead of returning\nto introduce his successor as was his original intention. But all is well\nthat ends well. The office force left to their own devices to scrape\ntogether copy for the compositors for the usual weekly issue has man\naged to get something together for the "interregnum," and today\'s\npaper is a sample of what the office force can do in a pinch\nto fill up the gap between the retiring of the old and arrival\nof new all round man of all work known as the editor of a County\nweekly paper.
