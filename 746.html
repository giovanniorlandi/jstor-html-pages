Tonight "The Dvna- 1\nmiters" will be the offering. This\nplay possesses every element to\nmake it a thoroughly pleasing at\ntraction. Its story is strong, its\nsituations thrilling and the com- !\nedy scenes are excruciatingly fun\nny.

This state\nment has called forth a storm of pro\ntest, not only from the press, but\namong well-informed labor leaders and\npolitical economists.\nNearly every independent journal\nhas taken Mr. Roosevelt to task. One\nof these, the Philadelphia Public\nLedger, published in the metropolis of\nthe strongest protectionist Stato in the\nUnion, devotes a column and a half of\nits space in refuting the President\'s\nstatement. Mr. Roosevelt, to Quote\nhim precisely, says:\n"As conclusively shown by the bul\nletin of the Bureau of Labor, the pur\nchasing power of the average wage re\nceived by the wage-worker has grown\nfaster than the cost of living."\nThe Philadelphia Ledger regrets that\nit cannot confirm this statement. It\nsays:\n"More reliable, because more disin\nterested, and more unprejudiced wit\nnesses than Mr. Roosevelt\'s Commis\nsioner of Labor, have time and again\ndeclared it conspicuously inexact.\nAmong the disinterested witnesses are\nboth Bradstreet\'s and Dun\'s carefully\ncompiled reports, and among the un\nprejudiced ones are several prominent\nlabor leaders, who have testified to the\ntruth respecting the wage scale of the\none part and the regular quotation of\nthe prices of the necessities of life of\nthe other part. And the precise testi\nmony given by these trustworthy wit\nnesses, is directly contrary to the Presi\ndent\'s* statement.\n"The prices of domestic commodities\nhave had an average increase from the\nlowest standard reached in 1896 of 37\nper cent. No sensible and well-in\nformed man will seriously assert that\nsince 1896 the average wage rate has in\ncreased to that extent? more than one\nthird. There is no workman in the\nland who can testify to the accuracy\nof this. The President\'s contention is\nthat the alleged greater proportionate\nincrease of the average wage to the\nincreased cost of living has been due\nto the beneficent protection afforded to\nlabor by the tariff. Here again the\nPresident\'s position is contested by\nlabor itself. It is true that the wages\nof artisans and their unskilled helpers\nhave been materially increased since\n1896, but while there have been slight\nincreases at various times of the wages\nof the so-called protected workmen,\nthe aggregate differences have not kept\nstep with the increase of the cost of\nliving.\n"At present the tendency all over\nthe country is to reduce the wages of\nthose employed in protected industries.\nAt Fall River, Mass., 25,000 textile\noperators are out of work and de\nprived of wages because they would\nnot consent to a flat wage reduction\nof 12 per cent. In Chicago the Meat\nTrust has crushed to death one of the\nmost powerful labor organizations be\ncause it demanded a reasonable in\ncrease of wages for the under paid\nlaborers. The Steel, Iron and Tin\nTrusts, Interests protected by the tariff,\nhave been largely reducing their wage\nschedules, as has also the Glass Trust.\nThe artisans, mechanics and all sorts\nof their unskilled helpers, to whom the\ntariff does not even pretend to give\nprotection, receive high wages, and\nwill continue to receive them so long\nas their unions remain intact. But\nwhat single tariff-protected industry\npays Its workmen the same generous\nreward for their labor that the un?\nprotected activities pay their em<\nployees for their labor."\nIt might be added that Commissioner\nWright\'s remarkable statement and\ntabulation upon which President\nRoosevelt bases his remarks already\nquoted, was discredited long be\'fore the\ncandidate\'s letter of acceptance was\nmade public, for Secretary Shaw In a\nstump speech delivered several weeks\nago stated that the Commissioner of\nLabor has prepared a bomb which\nwould blow the Democratic party sky.\nhigh, or words to that efTect. He said,\nIn so many words, that this "bomb"\nwas In the nature of a carefully pre\npared article showing that the Dem\nocratic contention that the cost of\nliving had been Increased out of pro\nportion to the Increase in wages was\nuntrue.\nCommissioner Wright\'s "bomb" has\ndeceived no person of average intelli\ngence. It bears on its face the im\nprint of untruthfulness born of th?\ndesperate necessities of a losing cam\npaign.\n?\nNo loafer respects a man who works,\nbut a bnrd wnrkinc man rather looks\nnp to n man who Is smart enough to\nlive In idlen^s.?

One day in passing her\non the stairs a lady accidentally\ntrod on her toe. "I beg your par\ndon, Helen/\' said the lady, where\nupon the wee sufferer replied, with\nft smile:\n"None of your business, Mrs.\nJones."\n"What do you mean?" exclaimed\nthe astonished lady.\n" I mean that you did not hurt\nma ? much," answered the uncon\nscious child, nodding complacently.\nIt was so funny and sweet that Mrs.\nJones did no correcting.\nA Iwlnton-Dana Story.\nThe crux of the newspaper question\nwas touched by a brilliant journalist\nthe late John Swlnton, for many years\nmanaging editor of the New York Sun,\nIn a retort on Mr. Dana. "Swinton."\nsaid Mr. Dana one day. "I need a first\nclass editorial writer. Have you one\nto recommend?" "How much are you\nwilling to pay, Mr. Dana?" asked Mr.\nSwinton. "For a first class man $125\na week," was the reply. "But you can\nnot get a first class man for that," pro\ntested Mr. Swinton. "Why not?" asked\nMr. Dana. "That Is what I pay you,\nand don\'t you consider yourself a first\nclass man?" "No, Mr. Dana," rejoined\nMr. Swinton. "If I were a \'first class\nman\' I should be paying you $125 a\nweek." That $125 a week practically\nmarked the limit of Mr. Swlnton\'s op\nportunity, as It may be said to mark\nthe limit of the same quality of brains\nIn journalism today? and also the limit\nof Something far more vital, for the\ndifference between a Dana and a Swin\nton defines status?

One firm of slaugh\nj terers kills 25.000 horses annually\nand they receive tne carcasses of an\nother 10.000 which are killed in al\n| parts of England. Curiously enough,\nj London is the only to?vn in Grea\'\nBritain where the cats\' meat man flour\nj lshes, and there appears to be a sur\nplus of sixty tons of sound horseflesh\nweekly, of which the cats of the me\ntropolis do not account for. There ar*\nsixteen licensed horse butchers in tli?\nmetropolis, who are mostly patron ized\nby Germans and Scandinavians, and\nalthough the trade is carried on sul\nrosa. it Is hinted that a very large pro\nportion of the tinned delicacies which\nfigure on our breakfast tables owe\nI their origin to the horse.? London\nI Daily New?.\ni .\nhow Islands Acquire VeKetttlon,\nNature In her slow, \'.eisurely way Is\nmak\'.ng a highly instructive experi\nment for us to show how Islands may\nacquire their vegetation. Just twenty\nyears ago the most stupendous volcan\nic eruption of modern times destroyed\nall life, animal and vegetable, in the\nIsland of Krakatoa. Three years later\nDr. Treub visited the place and found\nsome lowly microscopic algae settling\non the pumice and lava. These, it\nteemed, acted as decomposing agencies\nand prepared the way for ferns, which\nsoon began to appear. Then followed\na few flowering plants, probably from\ndrift seeds. Five years ago there had\nsettled sixty-two species of vascular\nplants, fifty of these being flowering\nspecies and representing twenty-one\nnatural orders. All these Mr. Bottling\nHemsley of the Kew gardens thinks\nreached the Islands Independently of\nman. He computes that about 8 per\ncent were carried by birds. 32 per cent\nborne by the wind and over 60 per cent\ncast up by the sea waves. In time\nwithout man\'s aid the Island, twenty\nmiles from its nearest neighbor, will be\nsgain covered with vegetation.? Lon\ndon Telegraph.\nGrpalea and Death.\n: The custom of placing the property\n! of the dead in their graves has always\n; been followed by the true Romany\ngypsies. It is due to some old tradition\nof ill luck attendUng the possession of\nan article whose former owner is gone,\nand much valuable property is buried\nin this belief. There is also a senti\nment among gypsies against the pos\nsession of anything that has belonged\nto a dead person, because it serves to\nremind the livin the departed and\nInspire in them a dread of death. The\n| custom of burying their property with\ngypuy dead dates from the earliest his\ntory of the Romany tribes.\nPresident For a Day.\nDavid R.

The opportunity of a\nlife-time is afforded in which to\nacquire, by a few days\' sojourn\nat the fair, an education which\ncould not otherwise be received.\nThe World\'s fair grounds cover\nover 12000 acres, being more than\ntwice as large as that of the\nWorld\'s Columbian exposition at\nChicago.\nOnly a few weeks remain in\nwhich to take advantage of this\ngreat opportunity. Every day\nfrom now until the close of the\nfair is a "special" day. The WA\nBASH is selling daily excursion\ntickets to the fair at greatly re\nduced rates; $12 St. Louis and re\nturn, on sale daily, except Fridays\nand Saturdays. Tickets good in\nPalace reclining cars; $15, St.\nLouis and return. Tickets on\nsale daily, and good in either Pal\nace reclining chair cars or Pull\nman sleepers.

It seems\ncurious that the first real step toward\nlightening the labor of children a>\nthey climb the ladder of learning was\nthe product of the imagination not of\nsome fond mother or gentlewoman\nteacher, but of a l>ewlgged and l?cM\ntied university doctor.\nIt was .Tohann Comenius. however\n?cho first conceived the daring idea\niliat children could bo taught by t ;?\naid of the memory and tjj:? imagina\ntion working together, "by means." a;\n\'je quaintly expressed it. "of sensuou*\nimpressions conveyed to the eye, s,\nuhat visual objwts may be made tlx\nmedium of expressing moral lessons t<\nthe young n *:id and of impressing\nthose lessor.s upon the memory." Ir\nother words. the good Ilorr Doctor had\ndie bright idea that picture books could\nt>e useful to children. Comenius made\nhi-? first picture booic and called it the\n?Orbis rictus." It contains rude wood\nuts representing objects in the nat\nural world, ns trees and animals, with\n?ittle lessons about the pictures. It Is\na quaint volume and one that would\ncause the average modern child not a\nlittle astonishment were it placed be\nr\'ore him\nAs truly, however, ns that term may\nOe applied to a?ny other book that lias\'\nsince been written, the "Orbis Pictus"\nwas an epoch making book. It is the\nprecursor of all children\'s picture I\nhooks, and modern childhood has great\ncause to bless the name of Com-nius.? I\nHousehold.\nAccording to Law.\nThis story is being told of a cer\ntain New York politician: lie had\nsucceeded in securing for a friend of\nhis a position as tax assessor at the\ncost of considerable exertion. Xot\nlong after the friend had benir\nwork in his new position the jk:....\ncian was surprised and grieved to\n6ee that he was taxed, under "per\nsonal property," $24 as the pos\nsessor of one goat. He called on\nhis friend the assessor for an ex\nplanation, accusing him of ingrati\ntude and forgetfulness of favors re\nceived.\n"But I couldn\'t do less than obev\nthe specific details of the law," pro\ntested his friend. "Look! Here\'s\nwhat it and he read from hi?\npapers, "l or all property bounding\nor abutting on the highways, $12\nper front foot." ?

The stone\nis not prohibitive in price and goe^\nbeautifully with almost anything\ncxcept sapphires.

Let one bear a weight all day long,\ndoes he not attribute his consequent\nheadache to the heavy burden he has\nborne Y It seems without elaborate j\nthinking we could conceive of the re- !\nsuits following upon prolonged use of\nthe eye. Nature has done all she could\nto protect and prolong the usefulness i\nof the eye. No earthly architect ever !\nyet planned a structure that would not\nyield, crumble and fall, and the house\nhuman, so exquisitely uplifted in curi\nous and mysterious ways, falls and re\nturns to dust more rapidly and surely\nthan need be, for the reason that we do\nnot realize how much one part Is sus\ntained or overthrown by another.

Thereupon he step\nped out to the liberal window sill, his\ncassock fluttering in the friendly wind,\nwhich, moreover, shut the window. The\nhasp was then turned, and. the dinner\nbell ringing, the refractory novice wept\ndown to the refectory.

The officers of the guns had to\nclear the locks of the Maxims of oil\nand carry thorn in their breast\npocket9 to keep them warm and dry,\nand the men took their rifles to bed\nwith them. Otherwise the oil would\nfreeze into a clogging mess, which\nwould cause misfires.

Bryan are as close ai\nbrothers. With emphasis the Gover\nnor to your correspondent to-day denied\nthat any portion of the followers of\nWilliam J. Bryan are at all lukewarm\ntoward Judge Parker\'s candidacy.\nCommenting on the situation as it\nstands to-day, Governor Hogg said: "I\nam heartily gratified at the general\noutlook. The outcome of the New\nYork State Democratic Convention\nwill do much toward stirring up our\nfriends in every debatable State. I\nhave no sort of doubt of Judge\nParker\'s election. Indications point\nto his carrying the three States of\nNew York, New Jersey and Connecti\ncut. I am convinced that he will have\nsufficient votes in the Middle West to\ndo t j rest of the work."\nIn or.?ir that there may be no doubt\nthat 40,000 Independent German-Amer\nicans of New York City intend to vote\nfor Roosevelt for the reasons above\nstated, Mr. Winter wishes it known\nthat his information is based on a\npersonal canvass made by a corps of\nexperts, every one of whom "was com\npelled to go before a notary public and\nmake affidavit that his return was\ncorrect." *\nComment is hardly necessary, but\nif any is to be made it should come\nfrom some of these 60,000 Independent\nGerman-Americans whom the Roose\nvelt League has belittled and insulted.\nFAITH VS. APPETITE.\nHon. Bourke Cockran, of New York,\nIn a speech, made recently before\nTammany Hall, characterized the dif\nference between Democracy and Re- \'\npublicanism in the following terse\nlanguage:\n"Democrats are a party of principle.\nThey follow principle and value it\nmore than profit. Republicans have\ndifTered more widely than Democrats\nupon every question which has been\nactive in our politics. They have dif\nfered about the Philippines, about the\ntariff, the gold question, about Cuba,\nabout every single question which has\ncome before the public, but their dif- j\nferences never prevented l..^m from\ncoming back as one m:... the moment\nthere was a chance of getting posses\nsion of the Government, and putting\ntheir fists into the Treasury. Demo\ncrats, on the other side, have thrown\naway prospects of success rather than\nsurrender their principles to which\nthey were committed. Democracy, in\nfact, is a faith, and Republicanism is\nan appetite."\nA CONTRAST.\n"The President\'s Dream of War," as\ncontrasted with "Judge Parker\'s plea\nfor peace," is the dominating idea of\na campaign card being distributed by\nthe National Democratic Committee.\nOn the obverse appears the follow\ning:\nPRESIDENT\'S DREAM OP WAR.\n"If we ever grow to REGARD\nPEACE AS A PERMANENT CONDI\nTION, and feel that we can afford to\nlet the keen, fearless, virile qualities\nof heart and mind and body sink into\ndisuse, we will prepare the way for\ninevitable and shameful disaster in\nthe future." ? From speech by Mr. j\nRoosevelt, when Governor, before New\nYork Republican Club, February 13,\n1899.\nThe military establishment of the\nUnited States, exclusive of pensions,\nwill, under four years of Roosevelt, in\na time of profound peace, have cost\n$515,000,000 more than under four\nyears of Cleveland.\nThis is the reverse of the document:\nPARKER\'S PLEA FOR PEACE.\n"The display of great military arma\nments may please the eye, and, for\nthe moment, excite the pride of the\ncitizen, but it cannot bring to the coun- j\ntry the brains, brawn and muscle of\na single immigrant, nor reduce the In- j\nvestment here of a dollar of capital, j\nOf course, such armament as may be\nnecessary for the security of the coun- 1\ntry and the protection of the rights j\nof its citizens, at home or abroad,\nmust be maintained. I protest, how- !\never, against the feeling that, by rea\nson of the commanding position we i\nhave assumed In the world, we must |\ntake part in the disputes and broil? of |\nforeign countries, and that because wc \'\nhave grown great we should intervene\nin every important question that arise.?\nin other parts of the world." ?

The employees are paying\ntheir share in a way, in being com\npelled to go back to work at the old\nwage. But the real payment, the oue\nthat takes shape in dollars and cents,\nis being paid, as it usually is, by the\n* .

Thr |\nclient ventured to suggest that thi>\nwas rather a high price for half v\nday\'s work. "It\'s not half a day\':,\nwork," said his lordship. "It i*\npart of my whole education ? all m*\nyears at the Temple, all the year*\nI have practiced, all the years of\nmy experience. It is half a day ou*\nof the heart of my life."\nTtar Longinf For Peace.\nPeace must entertain the heart and\nmind of every man, because that is\nwhat he Is longing for. It is either a\npeace with God or among men. The\nmeaning of this peac? is best under\nstood by contrast with the anxiety,\nstrife and suffering of tlx? world. In\nthis light one is forced to believe in the\nwords of St Augustine tnat "peace l?\nthe tranquillity of order which ha*=\nbeen established between man and hi\'\nCreator."

We fear that\nthe potato rot will be serious. The wet\nsoil and "muggy" weather give Just\nthe right conditions for the rot tc\nspread. If in the face of these trou\nbles buyers try to get the apples for\nless than they are worth by spreading\nreports of "big crop" there will be live\nly times. Our rej?orts show that the\n?pple crop Is short In secUons where\nlarge supplies are usually provided. Dc\nnot give away your apples or be\nfrightened Into selling them at a low\nfigure. The demand Is greater than\never before, while the total supply Is\nless than last year? Rural N>w Yorker\nThe Red Lobster.\nThe question Is often asked, says the\nLancet, without a satisfactory answer\nbeing supplied. Why do lobsters and\ncertain shrimps and prawns turn red\non boiling? One reason may be that\nthe black pigment of the lobster Is an\nIron compound in the lower state of\noxidation, which boiling oxidizes to\nthe higher state. Red human hair ia\nsaid to owe Its brilliance to Iron exist\ning In the higher oxidised state, and\nby means of reducing agents, such as\npyrogallic acid or nutgall, the color\nmay be modified. In short, oxygen Is\na great painter and probably account!\nfor the beautiful autumnal tints of\nplant life.\nFrame & Henderson\nDependable Furniture\n* GUARANTEED TO HOLD UP.\nThe only combination on cotton top mattresses with gen\nuine felt tops is sold by us.
