Going there in defiance \nof South Korea\'s official policy, she was enthusiastically welcomed \nby the North Korean authorities, who strove to present her as an \nembodiment of the alleged revolutionary spirit of South Korean \nyoungsters. However, in the long run Yim\'s trip produced totally dif\xad\nferent results. The North Korean audience, fascinated with Yim Su- \ngyong and quite attentive to her behavior, was able to read hints \nthat indicated the official picture of South Korean life as presented \nby the North Korean media was wrong. Contrary to the authorities\' \ninitial expectations, the trip made North Koreans more skeptical of \nthe officially approved worldview. Keywords: North Korea, Yim Su- \ngyong, political tourism.\nA RECURRENT PHENOMENON OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS "POLIT- \nical tourism,” pilgrimages by politically motivated individuals to \nthe countries they perceived as being the embodiment of their ideo\xad\nlogical dreams, or at least as being worthy of solidarity and support. \nThe best known examples of such trips are by Western leftists to the \nSoviet Union in the 1930s and Mao Zedong’s China in the 1960s, \nbut political tourism is a far more widespread phenomenon.1 While \nit is often associated with the political left (and leftist political \ntourism seems to be better studied), political tourism takes place \nacross the political spectrum.2\nWhile the literature on political tourism is extensive, it has \nlargely concentrated on the impact such trips produce on the visitors \nthemselves, as well as on their motivations and values. Little work \nhas been done on the impact that visitors produce on their hosts. It is\n245\n', '246 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\nusually implicitly assumed that governments use the political tours \nto increase their domestic legitimacy with perceived wide interna\xad\ntional support, and also to create a network of overseas sympathiz\xad\ners. Governments may succeed in these ways, but the actual results \nof such tours can often be quite different from the underlying inten\xad\ntions of the regimes that welcome these pilgrimages.\nPolitical tourism began on the Korean peninsula in the late \n1980s. South Korean left-wing activists started to travel to the \nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea). \nIn the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea), the notorious \nNational Security Law makes such trips illegal. But since the \ndemocratization of the late 1980s, the law has been applied with \nsome leniency, so many activists have braved the risks of (rela\xad\ntively short) incarceration and gone to the north.\nIn this article we discuss one prominent early case of a politi\xad\ncal pilgrimage—that of Yim Su-gyong, then a twenty-one-year- \nold Seoul student—to Pyongyang in the summer of 1989. She had \npredecessors: for example, shortly before her trip a well-known \nleftist-nationalist activist, Mun Ik-hwan, visited Pyongyang as \nwell.3 However, neither Mun Ik-hwan nor other South Korean vis\xad\nitors of the period approached the level of prominence that was \nreserved for Yim in the North.4\nThe goal of our article is to analyze the impact of Yim’s 1989 \ntrip on the North Korean audience. The North Korean people were \nexposed to the highly unusual and novel sight of a young, enthusi\xad\nastic, and (by the standards of the North) remarkably spontaneous \nSouth Korean girl traveling across their country. While some of \nwhat she did and said confirmed and reinforced the messages of the \nofficial propaganda, a lot of what she did actually made many \nNorth Koreans more skeptical of the officially endorsed picture of \nthe world in general and South Korea in particular. Yim Su-gyong’s \nvisit in fact did much to further the erosion of the increasingly \nanachronistic official DPRK worldview.\nThe Trip\nIn July 1989, the North Korean government held the Thirteenth \nWorld Festival of Youth and Students. Such festivals were spon\xad\n', 'Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 247\nsored by the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY), a \nleftist international organization with heavy connections to the \ncommunist bloc. Tellingly, its first general secretary and then vice \npresident, Alexander Shelepin, left the WFDY to become chair\xad\nman of Russia’s KGB (Scott-Smith 2012). The World Festivals \nwere arranged—at irregular intervals—as a large-scale and loosely \nstructured gathering of the left-leaning, anti-imperialist, and, gen\xad\nerally, pro-Soviet youth organizations from across the world. From \n1973 to 1997 the official slogan of the festivals was “For Anti- \nImperialist Solidarity, Peace and Friendship!”\nThe Thirteenth World Festival of Youth and Students was des\xad\ntined to become the last gathering of this sort before the disinte\xad\ngration of the socialist bloc. The festival was also arguably the \nlargest international event ever to be held inside North Korea. \nAccording to the WFDY official website, the festival was attended \nby 22,000 participants from 177 countries.5 In order to house these \nvisitors in relative comfort, a massive apartment complex was built \non Kwangbok Street in downtown Pyongyang, together with a \nlarge number of sports centers, stadiums, and public buildings to \nhost the festival’s activities.6\nFor the North Korean state, the significance of this event was \nmade even greater by its perfect timing: the festival followed the \nhighly successful Seoul Olympics of 1988 and was seen as an \nopportunity to showcase North Korea’s ability to equal, if not \noutdo, its archrival. Comparisons with the Seoul Olympics were \ncommon in the North Korean media of the time, and on July 10, \n1989, the day after the closing ceremony of the World Festival, \nthe entire fifth page of Rodong Sinmun, the primary official news\xad\npaper, appeared under the headline, “A Perfect Festival Which \nCannot Even Be Compared to the ‘Seoul Olympics’”—typed in \nlarge, bold letters, with ironic quotation marks meant to empha\xad\nsize the Seoul Olympics’ fake and fraudulent nature.\nIn South Korea, the mid-1980s were marked by a dramatic \ntransformation of the student movement. After the regime’s brutal \nsuppression of the Kwangju uprising in May 1980, the movement \nideology began to shift leftward. While in earlier times South \nKorean student activists tended to emphasize the noncommunist \nnature of their activities, from the mid-1980s North Korean trea\xad\ntises on juche thought as well as the works of Lenin and Marx\n', '248 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\nbegan to be perused on South Korean campuses with growing \ninterest. North Korea soon came to be perceived by a significant \nminority of student activists as a country to be emulated.7 Pro- \nPyongyang tendencies were noticeable in the National Union of \nStudents’ Representatives, better known under its Korean abbre\xad\nviated name of Chontaehyop.\nWhen Chontaehyop leaders learned about the Thirteenth \nWorld Festival, they decided to dispatch a delegation to \nPyongyang. Such plans ran counter to the prevailing mood in \nofficial circles in Seoul and were soon vetoed by the South \nKorean authorities. The final decision to ban the Pyongyang trip \nwas made on June 21 (MOU 1989). Nonetheless, Chontaehyop \ndecided to dispatch a small delegation that consisted of two peo\xad\nple. Only one of the two—Yim Su-gyong—managed to leave \nsafely for Pyongyang.\nBom in Seoul in 1968, the youngest daughter of a white-collar \nworker, at the time Yim was in her fourth and final year as a stu\xad\ndent in the French department at the Yongin campus of the \nHanguk University of Foreign Studies, a well-known stronghold \nof the South Korean radical nationalist left (Joseon chugan 2012). \nDeeply involved with Chontaehyop, charismatic, and good-look\xad\ning, Yim appeared to be the natural choice for the symbolically \nimportant goodwill mission the activists planned.\nIt also helped that Yim was not particularly prominent as a \nstudent activist and hence she was not on the list of “suspicious \nelements” whose overseas trips were banned at the time (Yim \n1999). She left Seoul on June 21, and on June 29, 1989, she \narrived in Pyongyang via Tokyo, Berlin, and Beijing, to receive a \nhero’s welcome.\nYim’s sojourn in North Korea lasted until August 15. For the \nmost part, her itinerary was similar to that of other visiting foreign \nVIPs. She was shown Kim Il-sung’s birthplace at Mangyongdae \n{Rodong Sinmun 1989a), Pyongyang subway, Kim Il-sung Uni\xad\nversity and Kim Ch’aek Polytechnic College {Rodong Sinmun \n1989d), Pyongyang film studio {Rodong Sinmun 1989e), Nampo \ndam {Rodong Sinmun 1989c), the Kumgang mountains, and the \ncity of Wonsan. On July 2, she had a short personal encounter\n', 'Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 249\nwith Kim Il-sung at a reception, during which she managed to \nleave behind a present given to her by Kim (Yim 1999). During \nher stay, she gave twelve speeches and participated in seven press \nconferences.8\nInitially it was declared that Yim would cross the Demilita\xad\nrized Zone (DMZ) at the truce village of Panmunjom on July 27, \nthe day the armistice was signed ending the Korean War in 1953. \nOn July 20, the International Peace March for the Unification \nand Peace in Korea began at Paektu mountain, at the northern\xad\nmost part of the country. The march crossed the entire country \nand arrived at Panmunjom on July 27. Predictably, the United \nNations side was not willing to let the 400-odd participants cross \nthe DMZ into South Korea. In response, some participants of the \nUnification March, including Yim, went on a hunger strike that \nlasted for six days. Finally, on another symbolically important \ndate, August 15 (Korea’s Liberation Day), Yim crossed the DMZ \nin Panmunjom accompanied by Mun Kyu-hyon, a Catholic activist \nwho had also visited the North in defiance of the official ban \n{Tonga Ilbo 1989). In South Korea, the incident made front-page \nnews, with left-leaning newspapers giving it somewhat more \nprominence.\nShe was immediately arrested (pictures of a handcuffed Yim \nwere prominently displayed in all North Korean newspapers), and \nsubjected to investigation, being accused of violating the National \nSecurity Law. On June 11, 1990, she was sentenced to five years’ \nimprisonment {Hangerye 1990) but was released in December \n1992, having served three and a half years.\nSince her release, Yim has lived a rather eventful life, \nremaining a noticeable, if somewhat controversial and scandal- \nprone, public figure. She became a journalist, moved overseas, \nand then returned to South Korea where in 2012 she was elected \nto the National Assembly as a candidate from the party list of \nthe left-leaning Democratic Party. She has a reputation as a \npolitician and activist with a great deal of sympathy for \nPyongyang. However, these events and activities—as well as \nYim’s political views, past and present—are beyond the scope of \nour article.9\n', "250 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\nYim's Trip in the Official Narrative\nExtensive Press Coverage in the North\nYim’s stay in the North produced an unprecedented amount of \npublicity. The report of Yim’s arrival appeared in Rodong Sinmun \non July 1. Being placed at the bottom of page 3, it had a relatively \nlow profile, but it was large and included a number of photos, one \nof which depicted Yim’s car being surrounded by cheering, per\xad\nhaps sincerely enthusiastic crowds.\nFrom then on, the mouthpiece of the North Korean govern\xad\nment published at least one article daily, sometimes more, related \nto Yim’s stay in the North. Newspapers across the country \nreported her travels, in particular her encounters with the North \nKorean students and foreign participants of the World Festival. \nThe press also occasionally ran pieces dealing with Yim’s signifi\xad\ncance as the living embodiment of the patriotic and pro-unification \ndrive of South Korean youth. Poems and essays dealing with Yim \nalso appeared occasionally.\nFrom July 1 to 20 Rodong Sinmun published twenty-eight \narticles largely dedicated to her, and from July 20 to 31 the num\xad\nber of such articles reached thirty-nine. From July 29 for about a \nweek, Rodong Sinmun dedicated the entire or almost the entire \npage 5 to the description of Yim’s exploits, as well as to the \nassorted documents related to her trip—with special emphasis on \nher struggle to be allowed to return home by land, via the DMZ. \nFrom around August 5, while the number of reports about Yim \ndecreased, she was still featured prominently.\nAfter Yim’s return to South Korea via Panmunjom, her incar\xad\nceration and trial remained a major topic for months. Rodong Sin\xad\nmun and other North Korean media outlets reported the solidarity \ncampaign that was being conducted by South Korean activists, as \nwell as actions in support of Yim that were being staged by the \nNorth Korean authorities. Such reports appeared in Rodong Sin\xad\nmun more or less daily until early 1990, including seventy-one \nreports in November 1989 alone.\nFor a few years Yim maintained celebrity status in the North \nKorean media. For example, the 1990 DPRK Yearbook (published\n", "Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 251\nin 1991) dedicated two full pages to her stay in North Korea and \nadditionally published two full pages of photos depicting her \nactivities. This is the same amount of space the 1990 DPRK Year\xad\nbook dedicated to discussion of the state of affairs in North \nKorean science {Joseon jungang nyeongam 1990). When Bradley \nMartin was on an official trip in Pyongyang in 1995 and visited an \nart studio, he noticed that “the main non-Kim subject of the artists \nturned out to be Lim [sic]” (Martin 2004, 365).\nImagery\nThe image of Yim then presented in North Korean official media \ngenerally agreed with the united front theory’s description of a \n“progressive South Korean intellectual.”10 She was presented not as \na hard-core Leninist (or juche') revolutionary but rather as an enthu\xad\nsiastic fellow traveler, a representative of the “broad masses” that \nare increasingly conscious of their historic destiny but still have to \nbe led, guided, and inspired by the revolutionary vanguard.\nThe North Korean media never ascribed to Yim straightfor\xad\nward expressions of loyalty to Kim Il-sung and did not represent \nher as a supporter of North Korea’s political and ideological sys\xad\ntem. For example, when reporting her first Pyongyang press con\xad\nference held on July 3, Rodong Sinmun quoted Yim as saying that \n“the way toward South-North unification should be based on the \nprinciple of great national unity that transcends ideologies, ideals, \nand systems” {Rodong Sinmun 1989b).\nYim did, however, make some critical remarks about the \nSouth’s National Security Law, as well as about the persecution of \nantigovemment activists in the South. She also explicitly blamed \nthe United States for both the division of Korea and the “eco\xad\nnomic exploitation” of Korea’s southern part {Rodong Sinmun \n1989b). Additionally, she reportedly expressed her admiration for \nPak Chong-ch’ol and Han Yong-hyon, two South Korean student \nactivists who had died in police custody as a result of torture and \nmistreatment {Rodong Sinmun 1989d).\nYim’s position fit well with the approach of the North Korean \ngovernment regarding the unification of the two Koreas. The \nNorth’s position was mapped out by Kim Il-sung in his Demo\xad\n", '252 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\ncratic Confederal Republic of Koryo plan. Addressing the Sixth \nCongress of the Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) in 1980 and talk\xad\ning about the early stages of unification, Kim Il-sung said, “The \nunited government of the Confederal state will respect the opinions \nof all social classes, groups, parties, and administrative organiza\xad\ntions, as well as the social systems that exist in the North and \nSouth” (Kim Il-sung 1987, 347).\nFurthermore, it is telling that the official party hierarchy (with \nthe significant exception of the KWP’s youth branch, Sarochong) \nkept some distance from Yim. In a report about her farewell rally, \nheld in Pyongyang on August 14, the presence of party dignitaries \nwas not mentioned. Instead, one can see a long list of party front \norganizations and their luminaries—including leaders of both \nnoncommunist puppet “parties” as well as top dignitaries from a \nnumber of officially tolerated religious and cultural groups such \nas the Korean Committee for Peaceful Unification and a Korean \nantinuclear peace committee {Rodong Sinmun 1989f).\nThus, in the official North Korean narrative, Yim’s political \nposition was clearly not radical: Her goal was not a juche revolution \n(although she was not hostile to this goal) but rather the restoration \nof national unity and the ending of the worst abuses of government \nin the ROK.11 At the same time, she was portrayed as “the official \nrepresentative of one million South Korean students” {Tongil-ui \nggoc 1989, 5), implying that her left-leaning, nationalist-tinted \nactivist views were shared by all South Korean youngsters.\nIn other words, she was the “flower of unification.” This \nremarkable sobriquet first appeared in North Korean media in \nearly August, but by the end of that month it had become Yim’s \nquasi-official title. Even the North Korean encyclopedic diction\xad\nary in 1999, shortly before references to her name disappeared \nfrom North Korean publications, described her in the following \nway: “Yim Su-gyong—South Korean patriotic youth, the flower \nof unification” {Joseon dae baeggwasajeon 1999, 326). Empha\xad\nsis was put on the difficult and dangerous struggle Yim had under\xad\ntaken. For example, in a poem dedicated to the heroic flower of \nunification, Ri Ho-gun, having described the coziness of Yim’s \nSeoul home (the description of which does not exactly agree with \nthe then officially approved image of South Korea as a “living\n', 'Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 253\nhell” and a “land of destitution”), goes on to note the great sacri\xad\nfice made by her and her family: “You have sacrificed your home \nin Seoul and all things thereof, . . . But the pain of national divi\xad\nsion was greater than the pain of seeing with your own eyes how \nyour parents are subjected to the cruelty and violence of the bru\xad\ntal and base policemen” (Ri Geun-ho 1990, 18).\nSome texts went further and explicitly suggested that Yim \nmight even face the death sentence when she returned home: “On \nAugust 15, together with . . . Mun Kyu-hyon she crossed the \nDMZ, disregarding the mortal danger” (Joseon dae baegg- \nwasajeon 1999, 326). On the day of her return to South Korea, \nRodong Sinmun said, “Yim Su-gyong knows perfectly well: Since \nshe went to Pyongyang without ‘permission’ of the South Korean \nauthorities, she might end up in fetters, she might die on the exe\xad\ncution grounds.” The North Korean media also occasionally \nclaimed that she was being tortured or at least faced a very real \nthreat of torture. Rodong Sinmun journalists wrote that she was \nsent to “the underground dungeons of the infamous Agency for \nNational Security Planning,” the den of monstrous torturers \nwhere, as South Korean people say, they can do everything to a \nhuman, apart from making a man into a woman or a woman into a \nman” (Rodong Sinmun 1989g). So, she was a beautiful flower \nwho was going back to hell.\nHell on Earth: South Korea in the North Korean Media \nof the 1970s and 1980s\nOfficial Control of Information\nAll communist countries tended to consider unfettered informa\xad\ntion exchanges with the outside world potentially dangerous and \ntherefore took measures to limit the interaction between their cit\xad\nizens and outsiders. Nonetheless, even against such background, \nNorth Korea went to extremes. Beginning in the early 1960s, the \nNorth Korean government dramatically curtailed all exchanges \nwith the supposedly friendly governments of the communist bloc. \nNorth Korean students were recalled from “fraternal countries,”\n', '254 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\nletter exchanges were all but stopped entirely, and permission for \nindividual overseas trips became impossible to get. The small \nnumber of foreigners who resided in North Korea (usually citi\xad\nzens of other communist countries, on official business there) \nfound themselves completely isolated from North Koreans, who \nbegan to avoid even the most trivial informal encounters with for\xad\neigners.12 From the late 1960s all nontechnical foreign literature \nwas ordered kept in special sections of libraries, being accessible \nonly to people with the proper security clearance. Additionally, \naround the same time, the private ownership of tuneable radio sets \nwas criminalized, and the authorities went to great lengths to \nensure the efficient enforcement of this ban.\nThese restrictions essentially put all alternative sources of \ninformation beyond the reach of average North Koreans and cre\xad\nated a virtual information monopoly for the state media and state \neducational system. North Korean propaganda was therefore able \nto create an image of the world deemed politically necessary by \nthe leadership of the country.\nThe picture of South Korea, as presented in the North Korean \nmedia, was remarkably bleak. In spite of the then ongoing eco\xad\nnomic boom, South Korea was depicted as an impoverished and \nstarving country whose population lived under the brutally \noppressive regime of the US occupiers (shown more or less like \nGestapo officers in the wartime allies’ propaganda) and their cor\xad\nrupt collaborators.13 The ROK was also described as a highly \nimmoral society where all kinds of vice were common.\nAs a short but perceptive summary of the depiction of the \nSouth in North Korea’s media of the late 1980s, we quote Michael \nHarrold, who worked there as an editor of English-language prop\xad\naganda materials in 1987-1994—exactly the time of Yim’s trip. \nSince his day job for years consisted largely of editing official \ntexts about South Korea, his somewhat ironic overview of this \npropaganda is basically accurate:\nSouth Korean people, dreaming of the day when they would be re\xad\nunited with their brothers and sisters in the North in the great leader’s \nembrace, stood permanently on the brink of the revolt.... As young \npeople themselves, [South Korean students] were conscious of the\n', 'Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 255\nplight of the many who were denied any education and who were \ninstead forced in droves into begging and petty crime. The streets \nof Seoul were littered with the homeless, living among the filth and \nrats. The country was plagued with pollution, poverty was rife, and \ndisease was rampant. Millions were unemployed. Inevitably, hun\xad\ndreds of thousands of young women were forced into prostitution. \n(Harrold 2004, 94-95)\nAs interviews conducted by the authors tend to confirm, a \nmajority of the North Koreans believed the official story. As inter\xad\nviewee A4 described the situation,\nWe believed that [South Korea] was an immoral society. For ex\xad\nample, if a man has money, he would live with many women, and \nwomen without money would become prostitutes. We believed that \nthe entire society was like that. [We thought] that this was a soci\xad\nety where everybody lived with the understanding that he or she \ncould be killed at any moment.\nThis credulousness was not very surprising: In North Korea the \npropaganda message was made even more efficient by the nearly \ncomplete absence of alternative information about the outside world.\nCracks in the Mirror\nThe first cracks in the officially endorsed image of the “destitute \nSouth” appeared in the early 1980s. It happened largely due to mis\xad\ntakes made by North Korean propagandists themselves. Actually, in \nYim Su-gyong’s case they repeated the same mistake, which in \nessence was an inability to understand the audience that was scru\xad\ntinizing visual images. The North Korean audience was able and \nwilling to extract undesirable information from a complex picture. \nIn the early 1980s, North Korean official television began to show \nfootage of students’ rallies in South Korea and, especially, the \nfootage of the Kwangju uprising of 1980. The intended goal was to \ndemonstrate the revolutionary spirit of South Korea’s youth and \nstudents, but these efforts brought unintended results.\nNorth Koreans were shocked to see how well-dressed rebel\xad\nlious students were, and they were also much impressed by the\n', "256 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\noccasional glimpses of Seoul and Kwangju cityscapes. As Al said, \n“During the Kwangju uprising, we in North Korea were greatly \nsurprised by what we saw. They used to tell us that people dressed \nin rags there, but these kids were so well dressed!” A2 says the \nsame: “In the 1980s they began to show the streets where rallies \ntook place in South Korea. Clean [streets], well-dressed people. \nWe got the impression it was a highly developed [country], many \ncars and the like.” A3 agrees: “When I watched the South Korean \nrallies on TV, [I noticed] that those South Korean youngsters were \ndressed in good jumpers, they were so well dressed.”\nIndeed, around 1990 North Korean propagandists began to \nunderstand the scale of the ideological contamination they had \ninadvertently created by broadcasting visual images of South \nKorean urban life. From the early 1990s, such dangerous footage \nlargely disappeared from North Korean TV. Nonetheless, these \nbelated measures could not reverse the situation: the damage had \nbeen done.\nAt the same time, in the late 1980s, South Korean popular \nmusic began to spread in the North, helped by the arrival of mod\xad\nem tape recorders—a luxurious item at the time, but still available \nto perhaps the top 10 percent of North Korean households around \n1990 (A2, A12). The catchy tunes as well as “nonideological” \nlyrics, not excessively loaded with propaganda, proved to be irre\xad\nsistibly attractive to the North Korean audience.14 A3 says that she \nbegan to listen to South Korean music around 1988, specifically \nmentioning “Wind, Wind, Wind,” the 1985 hit by Kim Pom-ryong. \nThis was the first sign of things to come in the early 2000s, when \nthe smuggled South Korean shows and movies came to comprise a \nsignificant part of North Korean home entertainment.15\nYim Su-gyong and the End of the Myth\nSources of Yim's Popularity\nWhile North Korean propagandists obviously hoped that Yim Su- \ngyong’s visit would reinforce the officially endorsed bleak picture \nof South Korea, things turned out quite differently. Yim’s much\n", 'Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 257\npublicized presence resulted in a remarkable change in how North \nKoreans thought of the realities of South Korean life.\nYim enjoyed instant and massive popularity in the North. \nVirtually all our interviewees knew her name and some basic \nfacts about her—including even those who were not born at the \ntime of her 1989 visit. In the North it appears that, with the pos\xad\nsible exceptions of South Korean presidents, she still remains by \nfar the best-known South Korean, even though, as we shall see \nlater, references to Yim have all but disappeared from the media \nin the last decade.\nA significant part of the official message about Yim was \nswallowed by the North Korean public. For example, many \npeople viewed her visit as a sign that Korean unification was \napproaching—unification being widely seen as a triumphant act \nthat would end all of the hardships and suffering faced by North \nKoreans at the time (A2, A9, Al 1). A2, who went on to become a \nrather cynical policeman, said, “Back then I really thought that \nunification would happen soon!”\nA2 is the only one among our interviewees who was able to \nsee Yim directly. At the time, he was a student of Kim Chaek Col\xad\nlege of Technology where Yim appeared a number of times. (For \nsome reason Kim Chaek College of Technology featured in her \nactivities more prominently than Kim Il-sung University, North \nKorea’s major center of higher learning.) A2 and his fellow stu\xad\ndents were ordered to attend one of these functions, where they \nwere given questions they were to “spontaneously” ask Yim. The \nstaged and prearranged nature of the event did not prevent A2 \nfrom feeling a great boost of enthusiasm. He believed that Yim \nwas a great person and also noticed her ability to deliver moving \nimpromptu speeches. At the same time he was taken aback by the \nair of affluence that surrounded her: “She did not look like a girl \nwho grew up in a destitute country. She felt rich.”\nIndeed, Yim’s looks and behavior delivered a serious blow to \na number of officially approved stereotypes about South Korea. \nFirst of all, virtually everybody noticed that Yim was exception\xad\nally well-dressed by the then North Korean standards, though her \ndress was nothing special by South Korean middle-class stan\xad\ndards. As a matter of fact, most of our interviewees mentioned her\n', '258 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\ndress style, seemingly extravagant and luxurious, as one of the \nstriking features that North Koreans noticed first (A5, A8, A10, \nA12). Apart from the general feeling of luxury, Yim’s dress also \ncontradicted some North Korean conventions of proper female \nattire, such as the officially enforced ban on wearing trousers out\xad\nside the workplace. “It felt . . . How should I put it? . . . It was \nwell felt that her dress was very free. It was felt that she was free \nto dress, to act [as she liked]” (A 14).\nAt any rate, in the early 1990s young North Korean women \ntried hard to emulate Yim’s style of dress, even though it was not \nthat easy, given the poor choices available in North Korean shops. \nSome North Koreans sewed their own imitations of her trousers and \nblouses. Her hairstyle was widely emulated, too (A4, A10, All, \nA12). Some of our interviewees even claimed that the idea of fash\xad\nion in North Korea began to spread only as a result of Yim’s visit. \nThese claims are not factually correct, obviously, since some fash\xad\nion had always existed in the country.16 Nonetheless, it is notewor\xad\nthy that these statements were made by a number of interviewees \nindependently of one another (A5, A8, A12). Thus, the somewhat \ndubious claim that Yim Su-gyong was the “founder of fashion in \nNorth Korea” to some extent must have reflected how important \nher visit was to North Koreans both culturally and socially.\nThe way Yim Su-gyong dressed even produced some doubts \nabout her family background. A5 mentions that at the time of \nYim’s visit there were rumors that she was the daughter of a very \nrich family, perhaps of some chaebol (family-owned conglomer\xad\nate) owners, since only such families could afford to dress their \nchildren like that. Interestingly, these rumors contradicted the \nofficial reports, which, ironically, correctly described Yim’s fam\xad\nily background as relatively modest. Most people, however, \nbelieved the official message about Yim’s origin and wondered \nwhether South Korea was indeed such a poor place if girls from \ncommon families could afford to dress like Yim.\nA5 also noticed that, apart from her dress, Yim looked like a \nperson who had lived a very comfortable life: “Her skin was so \ngood, no North Korean girl looked like her. Maybe only some \ndaughters of high-level officials [had similar looks].”\nAnother widely noticed and discussed feature was how freely \nshe behaved in public. North Koreans were surprised to see that\n', 'Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 259\nYim did not read her speeches from a prepared text but impro\xad\nvised (A2, A4, A5, A6, A7). “Wherever she went, she expressed \nher feelings eloquently in her speeches, and did so without a \n[prewritten] text. ... An outstanding woman!” (A6).\nTo understand why this seemingly ordinary feature of public \nbehavior attracted that much attention, one has to keep in mind the \nattitude toward the normative texts in the North Korean political \nculture. In Kim Il-sung’s North Korea, all public pronouncements \ndealing with political topics were seen as performative. Hence, \nsuch statements were supposed to be read aloud from a written \ntext, which had been carefully edited and censored by the ideolog\xad\nical authorities. The situation in North Korea was very similar to \nthat in the Soviet Union as described by Alexei Yurchak. If any\xad\nthing, the trends described by Yurchak were even more pro\xad\nnounced in North Korea: “Party speeches and documents . . . were \nincreasingly subject to endless editing, behind closed doors, to \nproduce texts that minimized the subjective stamp of the author \nand were preferably identical in style to texts previously written by \nothers. This led to a progressive tightening, anonymity and pre\xad\ndictability of authoritative language” (Yurchak 2006, 47).\nA4 essentially echoes Yurchak’s observations when she says, \n“In North Korea, when people are ordered to deliver a speech, \nthey are very formalistic. They always talk of Kim Il-sung, Kim \nJong-il and the like, always following the same standard. But she \n[Yim Su-gyong] appeared to speak with genuine passion and \nspontaneity.” Such enthusiasm and individualism appeared both \nhighly unusual and very attractive, and often was construed as a \nsign that South Korean “progressive students” were used to a \nmuch more permissive environment.\nSome of the better-educated interviewees drew more sophis\xad\nticated conclusions from their exposure to Yim Su-gyong. A4, for \nexample, recalls her impressions in the following way: “We used \nto believe that [South Korean] society was immoral, ... a society \nwhere such things as morals, as social ethics do not exist. But \n[Yim] used sophisticated language, she appeared to be a well- \neducated person. And we suddenly realized that people in the \nSouth also were educated.”\nThere were rumors that Yim had made highly critical remarks \nabout what was seen by the North Koreans as politically danger\xad\n', "260 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\nous issues. In one case she allegedly complained about excessive \nsecurity that surrounded her during her stay, and in another case \nshe reputedly suggested that she should be allowed to interact \nmore freely with North Korean youngsters (A2, A8). Whether or \nnot such remarks were actually made is unclear, but rumors circu\xad\nlated widely. In the tightly controlled North Korean environment, \nsuch remarks were seen as outrageously bold.\nThe Shock of Yim's Treatment on Returning Home\nArguably, the greatest blow to the official picture was how Yim \nwas treated upon her return to the South. Interviewees say they \nexpected Yim would be executed or at the very least imprisoned \nfor decades. For people whose ideas about state power and polic\xad\ning came from North Korea alone, such expectations were only \ntoo logical, especially when they were actively supported and \nencouraged by the official media. “We thought she was great. She \ncame to Pyongyang just to make a splash, and then to disappear \ninto prison forever. We believed she would go [South] and \npromptly disappear into prison” (A2). As we have seen, the North \nKorean media also encouraged such gloomy expectations.\nSo perhaps the largest of the ideological security blunders com\xad\nmitted by North Korean authorities was the detailed discussion of \nwhat happened to Yim after her arrest. As mentioned above, North \nKoreans, thinking in terms of their own experiences when it came \nto her case, presumed that an arrested political criminal would have \nno chance of emerging from prison alive. Therefore, they were \nquite surprised to see that Yim was released after only three years \nand five months of imprisonment (A2, A3, A4, A10).\nAs a number of informants told us, of special importance was \nthe short interview with Yim’s parents conducted by North \nKorean journalists who were officially in Seoul to cover ongoing \ngovernment-level talks. In mid-December 1990 the journalists \nvisited Yim’s family home in Seoul. Interestingly, in the resulting \nRodong Sinmun article, they did not fail to mention that on their \nway to her neighborhood they allegedly encountered “numerous \nbeggars” and “desperate-looking unemployed people” {Rodong \nSinmun 1990). They had a polite chat with Yim’s mother and\n", 'Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 261\nother family members that largely consisted of exchanging \nniceties, often related to Korean unification. Footage of the talk \nwas shown on North Korean TV. Later, North Korean journalists \nalso called Yim’s house; these phone interviews occurred at least \ntwice, on May 10, 1991, and November 29, 1991, and were \nreported by Rodong Sinmun the following day.\nOur North Korean interviewees vividly remembered the \nreports about the interview. They were taken aback by the discov\xad\nery that the “fascist puppet clique in South Korea” allowed the \nparents of known political criminals not only to remain free but \nalso to live in the nation’s capital and talk to the North Korean \njournalists with little problem. The audience was especially \nimpressed on realizing that Yim’s parents even treated their unex\xad\npected guests with beer—a rare and strictly rationed semi-luxury \nin North Korea of the early 1990s. At the time, in North Korea all \nimmediate family members of a political criminal were expected \nto be shipped to a prison camp. Therefore, the unbelievably \nlenient treatment of Yim’s family made many people suspect that \nthe South could not be the hellish and repressive place they had \nbeen led to believe (A2, A3, A4). A3 describes the situation in the \nfollowing way: “Most people believed that Yim Su-gyong would \ndie; this is why so many people cried when she left. We thought \nthat not only she, but three generations of her family, would per\xad\nish, as would happen in North Korea. And then we saw that she \nwas alive, and her parents were alive, and lived at home, and we \nsaw the footage of her house, so people began to consider South \nKorea in a different light.”\nThe North Korean Reassessment\nThe North Korean authorities seem to have belatedly realized that \ntheir propaganda campaign had backfired and began to play it \ndown. The number of references to Yim Su-gyong in the North \nKorean media dropped dramatically soon after her release from \nprison in December 1992. For a brief while newspapers ran articles \nabout the international reaction caused by her release, but from \nspring 1993 on, her name began to disappear. In 1994, Rodong Sin\xad\nmun carried only three articles dealing with Yim, in 1995 only one,\n', '262 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\nfollowed by two in 1996, and three in 1997. All these articles dealt \nwith her earlier exploits. Throughout 1994-1997, once a year, \nRodong Sinmun published a lengthy essay that waxed lyrical about \nYim’s 1989 trip to Pyongyang and the glories of unification.17 Then \nher name disappeared completely from its pages.\nIn 1998 and 1999 Rodong Sinmun did not publish a single piece \non Yim, although she was sometimes mentioned in passing. After \ntwo years, in December 2000, a lecture given by Yim in Tokyo \nbecame the topic of a short piece {Rodong Sinmun 2000). To the \nbest of our knowledge, it was the last time Rodong Sinmun pub\xad\nlished any text dedicated to Yim and her activities, even though she \ncontinued to be politically engaged and her activism in South Korea \ngenerally followed the trends that North Korea approved.\nYim Su-gyong’s name disappeared from other news outlets as \nwell. In May 1999, Ch’ollima, a high-circulation North Korean \nmonthly, published a lengthy piece authored by Yim Su-gyong. \nThe piece was a reprint: initially it appeared in South Korea’s far- \nleft Mai monthly and dealt with the death of Yim’s brother during \nhis military service in the 1980s (Yim 1999). This seems to be the \nlast time the North Korean ideological authorities allowed Yim \nSu-gyong to address North Korean readers.\nA search of the website of the Korean Central News Agency, \nNorth Korea’s official wire agency, also yielded only three post- \n2000 entries containing references to Yim Su-gyong, and then \nonly in passing. Remarkably, given her celebrity status in the \nNorth even now, her 2001 Pyongyang trip was not reported by \nthe official media. She went there as a member of the South \nKorean delegation, which in August 2001 attended a joint North- \nSouth festival, but her presence was not mentioned in Rodong \nSinmun. We therefore have ample grounds to suspect that Yim’s \nvirtual disappearance from the North Korean media since the late \n1990s might be related to the belated realization of the damage \nthat her unprecedented promotion inflicted on the officially \nendorsed worldview.\nActually, some signs of unease appeared much earlier. A3, a \ncollege student in 1989, recalls that soon after Yim Su-gyong’s \ndeparture the authorities staged a low-profile campaign aimed at \nrestricting Yim’s influence among younger North Koreans. While\n', 'Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 263\nadmitting Yim’s noble spiritual and political qualities, indoctrina- \ntors were at pains to point out that the ideologically healthy North \nKorean youth should not emulate her dress and behavior uncriti\xad\ncally, and “should learn from her only the things worth learning.” \nIt was explained that her dress style and behavior were infected \nwith the dangerous spirit of “liberalism,” a term of abuse in the \nNorth Korean political vocabulary.\nConclusion\nIn 1986, Regis Debray (1986), once an enthusiastic supporter of \nChe Guevara, remarked, “There is more power in rock music, \nvideos, blue jeans, fast food, news networks and TV satellites \nthan in the entire Red Army.” This is a prescient remark, espe\xad\ncially given that it was made at a time when the Soviet Union \nlooked invincible.\nIn the long run, few people would doubt that the collapse of \nthe Soviet Union was brought about by economic inefficiency and \npersistent shortage of consumer goods—two features that were so \ntypical of the Stalinist economic model. However, shortage could \nlead to popular dissatisfaction, and then to political action, only if \nits existence was widely recognized and understood in context. In \nother words, only the spread of information about the outside \nworld could (and did) make Soviet and Eastern European people \ndissatisfied with their lot.\nThis fact seems to be well understood by most communist gov\xad\nernments, which controlled and restricted information exchanges \nbetween their domains and the outside world. Strict border controls, \ncombined with internal surveillance and censorship, greatly reduced \nthe chances of “ideological contamination.”18 At the same time, \nadministrators and ideologues often hoped that they could control \neven the limited exchanges that were useful (and sometimes even \nvital) for the normal functioning of the communist state. However, \nthese controls were not always completely reliable.\nThis idea has been eloquently expressed by Yale Richmond, \nwho wrote, “What caused communism to collapse and the Cold \nWar to come to a close? . . . There is a grain of truth in some . . .\n', '264 Unexpected Results of a Political Pilgrimage\nexplanations, and more than a grain in others, but I will provide \nmany grains of another explanation—that the end of the Cold War \nand the collapse of communism were consequences of Soviet con\xad\ntacts and cultural exchanges with the West” (Richmond 2010, 61). \nSimilar observations have been made by Allen Kassof, who \nspecifically emphasized the role Western scholars’ trips to the \nSoviet Union and Eastern Europe played in changing minds and \nattitudes there (Kassof 1995).\nA few writings discuss the impact on those few Soviet and East\xad\nern European citizens who were allowed to go overseas (Gorsuch \n2011). However, little is said about the impact the sight of the for\xad\neign visitors produced on residents of the socialist bloc countries. \nThis shortage of literature is explainable: While such encounters had \na major impact on people directly affected, the general impact on \nsociety was relatively small, since in those countries only a tiny \nfraction of the population usually had the opportunity to interact \nwith foreigners. These people—interpreters, guides, drivers, and the \nlike—usually remained silent about their experiences, largely out of \nfear of losing their prestigious and well-paid jobs.\nYim’s case is unique because the North Korean media turned \nher visit into a media event and thus unintentionally provided the \nmajority of the population with glimpses of authentic South \nKorean behavior. These glimpses were powerful enough to plant \nthe seeds of doubt among many people who hitherto more or less \naccepted the official propaganda about South Korea and its soci\xad\nety. The story of Yim Su-gyong is thus a good example of the \nunintended consequences that propaganda can sometimes yield. \nNorth Korea’s propaganda specialists underestimated their audi\xad\nence’s ability (and willingness) to discover and interpret hidden \nclues that contradicted the message they wanted to deliver. Yim \nwas meant to symbolize South Korean youths’ alleged willingness \nto become activists in a broad popular front, fighting in support of \nNorth Korea’s ideological goals and looking upon North Korean \nsociety with a measure of respect and admiration. While Yim’s \nverbal statements generally conformed to this message, her “non\xad\ntextual” behavior spoke volumes about the society she came from, \nclearly contradicting what the North Koreans had been led to \nbelieve about the South.\n', 'Seok-hyang Kim and Andrei Lankov 265\nWhile the North Korean authorities, somewhat belatedly, real\xad\nized the political and ideological problems caused by Yim’s trip, \nand began to play down its significance, they were too late. Irre\xad\nspective of her own intentions, and contrary to the intentions of \nher North Korean minders, Yim’s trip created a major breach in \nthe wall of self-isolation that the North Korean authorities had \nmaintained for decades. This breach, in turn, also contributed to \nthe growing popularity of South Korean culture, which culmi\xad\nnated in the “South Korean boom” that North Korea began to \nexperience in the early 2000s. Yim Su-gyong’s blue jeans indeed \nhad a great deal of power—much more than her handlers realized.\nNotes\nSeok-hyang Kim is professor at Ewha Womans University.
