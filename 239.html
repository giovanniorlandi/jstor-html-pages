        <pre>['Chapter 1:\nFrom Lebedian’ to St\xa0Petersburg (1884–1906)\nAnd so  — I am free. I have left far behind me the dreary, unspeaking\nwalls, the iron clang of the bolt on the door, the scrap of blue \nsky pitilessly bisected by the stern bars, the grim and tormented \nfaces of my comrades, and those silent days, grey and cold as \nstone. All that has vanished, into that gulf we call the past. I am \nfree. And instead of the prison vaults the azure sky of springtime\nstretches away above me; and instead of the stone silence \nof walls the wind whispers warmly and tenderly. I can no longer \nsee our Struggle, with its harsh and proud face twisted by suffering.\nThey don’t know how to struggle here. […] Around me \nhere there is cheap, trite contentment; people doze peacefully in \ntheir soft and cosy swamp… […] I’ve already begun gradually \nto get down to work. For some reason music doesn’t draw me as \nit usually does, nor singing. I sit alone with my books, and with \nmy… fantasies. My fantasies? Do you think that they will pass? \nBut how will they pass if I don’t wish them to pass or rather, \nI cannot, do not have the strength to wish such a thing? How is \na man who is ill to be cured, if he doesn’t wish to be treated, to \ntake any medicine? Is it necessary to be treated?\u200a1\nThe writer of these words was a young man of 22, just released \nin March 1906 after a three-month spell in solitary confinement in \na St Petersburg prison on suspicion of revolutionary activity. Above all \nhe was anxious here to impress the girl he had met only weeks before \nhis arrest with the nobility of his feelings. Now confined by the authorities\nto his family home over 1,000 kilometres away in Lebedian’, as far \naway again to the south-east of Moscow as the capital is distant from \nSt Petersburg, he was chafing with frustration.\nLebedian’ is a small provincial town in the very heart of \nEuropean Russia. At the time of Evgeny Ivanovich Zamiatin’s birth \non 20 January 1884,2 the place numbered around 800 houses with \n', 'Chapter 1 7\nsomething like 6,000 inhabitants, a number which even in the present\ncentury has grown to not many more than 20,000. The little town \nspreads over the hilly slopes leading down to the upper reaches of \nthe river Don which, still fairly narrow, has not yet acquired a formal\nembankment, and is still bushy, full of reed banks, little islets and \nducks. Typically the homes of the local merchants and other townsfolk \nwere extended with small verandas facing the road, where families \nwould sit to drink their tea in hot weather. Zamiatin’s father Ivan was \ngood with his hands and did much to improve their modest one-story \nwooden house on dusty Pokrovskaia Street, creating an orchard out \nof the garden which tumbled down the steep slope right to the edge \nof the Don: the district, bordering on the black-earth region, is known \nfor its abundant varieties of crunchy, juicy apples. There was a tennis\ncourt down by the river too, and bathing nearby. Later Ivan would \nbuild a second house next to their own for Evgeny’s only sibling, his \nyounger sister Aleksandra (1885–1957), when she married.3\nLebedian’s situation on the Don, at the point of intersection \nbetween five different provinces (Tambov, Voronezh, Riazan’, Orel \nand Tula), had established its significance as a thriving market town, \nand since the late seventeenth century a major horse fair would be \nheld there three times a year, with exotic stalls, traders, card-sharps, \nand gypsies. Ivan Turgenev described the lively event in Lebedian’, \none of the brief sketches in his 1852 Hunter’s Notebook: “When they \nhad concluded their deals, they hurried off to the inns or the taverns, \ndepending on their rank… And all of them bustled about, swarming \nand shouting, quarrelling and making it up, cursing and laughing, \nup to their knees in mud.” In a letter to “Katia” (possibly a cousin) \nwritten when he was eight, Evgeny says his mother has bought him \na new ball for 75 kopeks at the January fair, held to mark the Feast of \nthe Epiphany, and that they also purchased a new pony. The family \nmust have been quite comfortably off by the standards of the day: in \nthe same letter he tells her that his father has been made Chairman of \nthe Famine Committee, and has bought some scales so as to be able to \ndistribute the oats and rye provided by the authorities to the village \npriests, who would deliver it to the hungry. The railway reached the \ntown that same year, in 1892.4\nIn his several short autobiographical accounts of his early life, \nZamiatin portrayed himself as a bookish, solitary child who could \nproudly read the newspaper headlines to his parents by the age of \nfour: reading and writing, like spelling, came to him “astonishingly \n', 'Chapter 18\neasily, instinctively.”5 A couple of lengthy and very affectionate letters \nto his “Dear mama,” written even before he had learned to separate his \nwords properly, have been preserved. In one, written in the late 1880s \nor early 1890s, he reports that his sister Sanya or Sasha (Aleksandra) has \nbeen poorly with her glands, that the goat is pregnant, that the asters \nin the jar have begun to come up, and that he is eating eggs and drinking\nmilk because he is fasting.6 His mother, Maria Aleksandrovna, \nnée Platonova, (1864–1925) was the daughter of the local priest; she \nhad received a good education, had a gift for music, and liked to play \nChopin, Brahms, Beethoven and Schumann. Zamiatin recalled lying \non his stomach, reading under the piano, while hens and a piglet \nscratched around in the dust on the street outside the window framed \nwith geraniums. His father, Ivan Dmitrievich Zamiatin, (1853–1916), \nwas also from a clerical family, in nearby Lipetsk. In 1883, the year of \nhis marriage, he was appointed priest for the church of the Pokrovskaia \nparish in Lebedian’, taking the post over directly from his father-inlaw,\nwho died that same year. The young couple therefore established \ntheir married life in Maria’s family home, where the household continued\nto include her widowed mother Anastasia (1836–1914), and her \nyounger sister Varvara (Varia; 1872–1931). Ivan Dmitrievich is said to \nhave been a kind man with a slight stammer, well-liked by his parishioners\nand steadily rewarded by the Church throughout his career for \nhis exemplary service. The life of the household was dominated by \nreligious observances, the reading of scriptures, a stream of visits from \nmembers of the congregation and local clerical figures, and family \ntrips to nearby monasteries; or religious processions in the summer, \n“with the scent of wormwood, clouds of dust, and sweaty pilgrims, \nwho scrambled on all fours beneath the icon of Our Lady of Kazan’, \nitinerant monks and nuns, and the holy fool Vasia the Antichrist, alternately\nproclaiming the pious and the unprintable…”7\nZamiatin remembered a few traumatic moments from his early \nchildhood: at the age of eighteen months being held up to the window \nand watching the red sun on a day when he was ill, and apparently \nclose to death; the feeling of desolation he experienced after getting \nseparated from his parents in the crowd at church in nearby Zadonsk \na year or so later; and his mother and aunt Varia hurriedly closing \nup the house when cholera patients were being transported along the \nstreet. He could also remember his pride at setting off in long trousers\nfor his first day at the local gimnaziia, or grammar school. His \nfather, Ivan Dmitrievich, had taught Latin and calligraphy in a num-\n', 'Chapter 1 9\nber of local schools, and was now in charge of religious instruction \nthere. At the age of eleven Evgeny compiled a magazine, Kaleidoscope, \nwhile recovering from measles. After five years at school in sleepy \nLebedian’, and with a certificate signed by his teachers (including his \nfather) for a book prize “for excellent behaviour, effort and achievement,”\nthe young Zamiatin transferred at the age of twelve to start \nboarding at the gimnaziia at Voronezh, the provincial capital a hundred\nkilometres or so to the south.8 Like Lebedian’, Voronezh stands \non the bustling river Don, one of Russia’s major waterways.\nDescribing his Voronezh school years from 1896 to 1902, Zamiatin \nmentioned one occasion at school when, aged about fourteen, he \ndecided not to tell anyone he had been bitten on the leg by a rabid dog \nuntil the two weeks in which the infection might make itself apparent\nhad passed. This was a boyish test of his own character, during \nwhich time he kept the only diary he ever wrote. He was then rushed \nto Moscow for a course of injections, but all was well. At the age of \nseventeen he wrote to his sister Aleksandra, herself away at school in \na different town, a solemn if affectionate letter: he described playing \nthe piano and visiting the theatre, enumerated the top marks he had \nreceived for all his exams, told her how much he had enjoyed Grigory \nDanilevsky’s 1863 novel Freedom (which highlighted the inadequacies \nof the 1861 Emancipation of the Serfs), promised to send her some suggestions\nfor the essay she was due to write (he had one to do himself \non the lyrical digressions in Gogol’s Dead Souls), and then embarked, \nas she had requested, on a lengthy (and somewhat pompous) disquisition\non the true nature of love.9 Despite the starred top marks \nhe regularly received for Russian composition, “I didn’t always find \nmathematics easy to get on with. Perhaps for that very reason (out of \nstubbornness) I chose the most mathematical course: the Shipbuilding \nFaculty of the Petersburg Polytechnic Institute.” In actual fact, his \nreference from Voronezh noted his “excellent achievements […], especially\nin Russian and the classics, and in mathematics.”10\nZamiatin acknowledged that the opportunities the shipbuilding \ncourse offered for students to travel the world had also provided a considerable\nincentive in his choice of higher education. And despite the \nfact that the nearest open sea was about 1,000 kilometres away both to \nthe north and to the south, the river Don near Lebedian’ and Voronezh \nhad been a major centre for shipbuilding since the seventeenth century,\nso the subject was not an entirely remote one.11 He completed his \nschool studies in Voronezh in 1902 with a “gold medal,” awarded for \n', 'Chapter 110\nstraight As in the final examinations  — a medal he would soon have to \npawn for 25 roubles in St Petersburg. He also received a certificate noting\nthat there were no entries concerning him in the conduct record, \nand that “as for his moral conduct, Zamiatin (Evgeny) has been completely\nabove reproach.”12 However, he was given a warning on his \nfinal day by one of the school officials about the behaviour of a former \npupil, P.\u200aE. Shchegolev, who would later become an eminent literary \nscholar: “He also left here with a medal […]. And now he has landed \nin prison. My advice to you is: ‘don’t write, don’t follow that path.’ \nThis edifying advice didn’t help me.” Shchegolev was some seven \nyears Zamiatin’s senior, and would in fact become one of his close \nfriends in St Petersburg.13\nIn applying to the Polytechnic Institute as part of its first ever \nintake in October 1902, Zamiatin was aiming for the very best: there \nwere 500 applicants for the 25 places in the Shipbuilding Faculty, and \nthose admitted had to come for interview with an outstanding academic\nrecord, a knowledge of foreign languages (he had studied \nGreek and Latin as well as French and German), and a reference confirming\ntheir “reliability.” The Institute, created under the auspices \nof the Finance Minister, Count Witte, to promote industrial and economic\ndevelopment, was housed in magnificent new buildings. All \nthe students lived in single rooms in comfortable hostels at Sosnovka, \non the outskirts of the city, and the place was equipped with the facilities\nand teachers to train the élite of their generation. Like Pushkin \njoining the first intake of the Lycée at Tsarskoe Selo a century earlier, \nthe future writer would be receiving the best education the country \ncould offer. The Shipbuilding Faculty aimed to produce specialists \n“to whose native wits and talent higher education would open up \nnew paths for discoveries and inventions.”14 He moved to the city in \nAugust 1902, to start life as a student there on 1 October. Within weeks \nof his arrival, however, he wrote to his sister Aleksandra to say he was \nanxious that he might have made the wrong choice in opting for shipbuilding\nrather than economics. It was not the difficulty that put him \noff, although he described his heavy routine of lectures from 9 until \nabout 5, with a break for 90 minutes, on top of homework, but he \ndid like the sound of the topics the economists were studying, which \nappealed to him more than mathematics. Anyway, he was going to sit \nin on a lecture for economists on medieval history before asking to \nchange course.15 But evidently he soon reconciled himself to his original\nchoice.\n', 'Chapter 1 11\nA strength of purpose and an inclination to seek out the apparently\nparadoxical, less straightforward path are apparent in these \nglimpses of his early life, as they are in Zamiatin’s reflections in that \nfirst letter to his girlfriend after emerging from prison in 1906 on the \nwisdom  — or otherwise — of attempting to “cure” himself of his fantasies\nand creative impulses. The perverse pursuit of turbulent freedom \nrather than sedate happiness had been a key Dostoevskian theme, \nand would become an essential preoccupation in Zamiatin’s writings\nas well. It perhaps comes as no surprise, therefore, that this child \nof a lower middle-class, pious provincial family, a modestly-ranked \n“hereditary honourable citizen” as the official designation put it, soon \nfound himself caught up in the widespread revolutionary ferment \nof life in St Petersburg.16 Tsar Nicholas II’s reign had seen increased \nrestrictions placed on such modestly democratic institutions as the \nzemstvo (local council) system, which had been introduced during \nthe reform era of the 1860s; an aggressive policy of Russification had \nfostered regional discontent, and provided the fuel for anti-Semitic \nsentiments and the widespread pogroms of the turn of the century; \nand the emergence of a radicalised youth led to bonds being formed \nbetween oppressed workers and the well-educated but alienated leftwing\npolitical groups. This discontent was exacerbated when foreign \nadventure  — an attempt to check Japanese ambitions with regard to \nChina and Manchuria  — ended in the Russian fleet’s humiliations at \nPort Arthur in 1904 and Mukden and Tsushima in 1905.\nZamiatin was present on a white winter Sunday on Nevsky \nProspect, the main street of St Petersburg, watching the clock with \na large crowd: “And when the signal was given  — one stroke, one \no’clock  — black shards of humanity flew in all directions along the \nProspect, there were snatches of the Marseillaise, red banners, Cossack \nsoldiers, yardsweepers, policemen… The first demonstration (for me) \n—was 1903. And the closer it came to 1905—the more feverish the turmoil,\nthe noisier the gatherings.” On 28 November 1904 he witnessed \nanother demonstration on Nevsky Prospect calling for the creation \nof a Constituent Assembly (the first necessary step towards the \nintroduction of democratic political structures); this was vigorously \ndispersed by the Tsar’s loyal Cossacks, assisted by the police.17 Shortly \nafterwards, the year of the first Russian Revolution opened with the \nnotorious events of 9 January 1905, known as “Bloody Sunday.” An \nunarmed procession of strikers from the Putilov Works was marching \ntowards the Winter Palace to present a petition to the Tsar. The crowd, \n', 'Chapter 112\nled by a priest, Father Gapon, included many women and children, \nand carried icons and portraits of the Tsar. Nonetheless, the troops \npanicked and began to cut them down, killing over a hundred demonstrators\nand wounding many more as they trudged through the snow. \nThe outrage prompted by these events sparked a wave of unrest and \nsympathy strikes throughout the country. Some Polytechnic students \nhad taken part in the march; one had been killed, and his funeral was \nfollowed by resignations and disturbances at the Institute. Zamiatin, \nwho had as usual been granted leave to return home to Lebedian’ for \nthe Christmas holidays, sent a telegram to the Institute to ask what \nwould happen about the start of classes; he was told that there would \nbe no question of classes beginning before 15 February that year. In \nfact, classes at the Institute were suspended for over eighteen months \nbecause of the unrest, resuming only in the autumn of 1906.18\nAs a student Zamiatin had to live on the meagre income provided\nby his family; in December 1903 he was obliged to apply to the \nInstitute authorities for a grant of a few roubles to travel to Moscow \nto receive medical treatment for some unspecified ailment; this he \nwas accorded, along with relief from payment of some of his fees. \nIn November 1905 he was granted permission to leave for Lebedian’, \neven though he had not yet paid all the rent due for his hostel accommodation.19\nBut he lived well enough, and his desire to travel was \namply fulfilled by the course he had settled on: each summer was \nspent doing practical classes in shipyards, or afloat. Now he discovered\n“Russia, third-class railway carriages full of jokes and laughter, \nSebastopol, Nizhny [Nizhny Novgorod, on the Volga], the factories on \nthe Kama River, Odessa, the port, down-and-outs.” In 1903 he was in \nSebastopol (in the Crimea) from May until September; in 1904 he travelled\nto the river Kama, in the Urals north of Perm; and in the summer \nof 1905 he undertook as a 21-year-old the most exciting sea journey of \nhis life, when he sailed on the steamship Rossiia from Odessa across \nthe Black Sea, out into the Eastern Mediterranean, and round the coast \nas far as Alexandria. Everything he saw was exotic: “Constantinople, \nthe mosques, the dervishes, the bazaars, the white marble quayside \nat Smyrna, the bedouins in Beirut, the white breaking surf at Jaffa, \nthe green and black colours of Mount Athos, plague-ridden Port Said, \nthe yellow and white colours of Africa, and Alexandria, with English \npolicemen and traders selling stuffed crocodiles […]. And Jerusalem, \nwhich was special, different from all the rest, astonishing  — where \nI lived for a week or so with the family of an Arab I knew.”20\n', 'Chapter 1 13\nHis return from this summer trip in mid-June 1905 brought \nhim directly into the epicentre of revolutionary turmoil, for his ship \nsailed back into Odessa just as mutiny broke out there on the battleship\nPotemkin. The crew of the battleship, one of the newest in the fleet, \nwere already demoralised by the defeats during the Russo-Japanese \nWar. After being threatened with harsh treatment for protesting at \nbeing served rotting meat, they rebelled against their officers. There \nwas a stand-off outside the port of Odessa; and when a naval squadron\nwas sent to quell the rebellion, their crews mutinied as well, and \nthe Potemkin was allowed to escape to Romania. This episode gave \nthe Tsar a stark warning that his armed forces could no longer be \nrelied upon. Zamiatin wandered around Odessa for an entire day and \na night with the engineer of the Rossiia, amidst gunshots, fires and \npogroms. In his semi-documentary story Three Days (1913) he graphically\ndescribed the events from the perspective of a ship passenger \nrecently back from a trip to the Middle East, still overwhelmed with \nvisual impressions of blinding heat and sand, and the silky sound of \nthe waves. The story depicts the fascinated glimpses the passenger \nreceives of the common people’s spontaneous sympathy for the rebelling\nsailors, and the behaviour of the town’s respectable citizens as \nthey scurry nervously through the town, gather to gawp, or scatter \nin panic after a bomb is thrown. The narrator’s principal concern is to \nrejoin his ship, which, after an alarming time spent in close proximity \nto the Potemkin and the new squadron sent from Sebastopol to quash \nthe uprising, slips away from Odessa and along the coast to Ochakov.\nWhen Zamiatin returned north to St Petersburg, it was to find \nthe city in disarray with strikes and meetings, but vivid, exciting \nand fun. “The summer of 1905 was gaudy, a particularly bright blue, \ntaut, packed to the brim with people and events. […] In those years \nto be a Bolshevik was to take the line of maximum resistance; and \nso I was then a Bolshevik.”21 He actually joined the Bolshevik section \nof the Russian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party [RSDWP (b)] that \nSeptember. While studying at the Polytechnic Zamiatin had become \ninvolved in student affairs, and was a member (and by the end of \n1907 the Chairman) of the students’ Senior Council. As he commented \ntwenty years later, “All that seems like a whirlwind now: demonstrations\non Nevsky [Prospect], Cossacks, student and worker groups, \nlove, enormous meetings at the University and in the Institutes. \nThen I was a Bolshevik (I’m not a Bolshevik now), and I worked in \nthe Vyborg District: at one point I kept a printing-press in my room. \n', 'Chapter 114\nI battled against the Kadets [moderate Constitutional Democrats] in \nthe Senior Council.”22 By the second week of October 1905 Soviets \n[Workers’ Committees] had been set up, and the country was almost \nbrought to a standstill by a nationwide general strike. The Tsar was \nforced to issue a Manifesto on 17 October representing a significant \nstep towards constitutional reform: it provided for a parliamentary \nDuma, which was to be elected on a very limited suffrage, but would \nhave the right of veto over legislation; and it also promised civil rights, \nincluding freedom of speech and assembly. On the Left, however, people\nwere still not satisfied with these concessions.\nBy this time Zamiatin had become a Party activist: in midNovember\n1905 he had hastily to change his address, so as to be able \nto carry out more discreetly tasks such as distributing leaflets and hiding\nweapons or explosives. There were still no classes at the Institute. \nHe worked at the Vyborg District headquarters of the RSDWP (b) and \nattended numerous meetings, including one on 22 November to discuss\na referendum about Party factions. It was on this occasion that he \nfirst met an attractive young medical student, Liudmila Nikolaevna \nUsova (1884–1965), who was working with the Bolsheviks alongside \nZamiatin’s fellow-students from the Polytechnic, Boris Krylov and the \nbibliophile Iakov Grebenshchikov.23 He recalled later that he had spotted\na pretty girl as they sat in the crowded library before the meeting \nbegan, and was then both dismayed and pleased to discover that he \nwas to carry out his revolutionary tasks under her command. He bridled\nat her authority over him, while being charmed by her liveliness \nand directness, and soon found himself infuriated and resentful of her \ncloseness to Boris Krylov. “Oh, how pleased I am! How cross I made \nher today! I want to hurt her, be unpleasant. She is threatening not to \ntalk to me. So does that mean she really is indifferent?”24\nHowever, within days he went to the Iavorskaia Theatre together \nwith Liudmila, to see the première of Evgeny Chirikov’s The Jews. With \nits appeals from the stage for an end to the exploitation of the workers,\nand its graphic depiction of a pogrom, the play caused a sensation. \nWritten in 1903 in response to a notorious pogrom in Kishinev that \nspring, the play had initially been banned in Russia, but was staged \nin 1904–05 in Berlin, London, New York, Chicago and Boston. What \nZamiatin remembered of the evening, though, were the childlike simplicity\nwith which Liudmila kissed her mother goodbye as they left for \nthe theatre, and his delight when she watched the play from the row \nbehind him with her head resting on his shoulder.25\n', 'Chapter 1 15\nAt the end of November 1905 he applied as usual for formal permission\nto return to Lebedian’ for the holidays, but on this occasion \nhe did not in fact leave the capital. On 3 December, the entire executive\nof the St Petersburg Soviet, which was dominated by the young \nTrotsky, was arrested. On 11 December, Zamiatin himself was arrested, \nalong with 30 fellow-members of an armed unit at the RSDWP (b) \nHeadquarters of the Vyborg District, in the flat of a certain Konstantin \nvon Shul’man.26 The police burst in and discovered the group with \nplans and firearms. Zamiatin was obliged to do some quick thinking:\non the previous evening a “wing-eared” worker he knew called \nNikolai V. had visited him and asked to leave a bag of explosive guncotton\nwith him, because he was being followed. The discovery of the \ngun-cotton in his room, sitting in a paper bag on the windowsill next \nto some sugar and some salami, as well as the Socialist Revolutionary \nleaflets under his bed, could have meant the death-penalty. After he \nhad been searched and roughed up during the arrest, he managed to \nscribble a quick note and drop it out of the window to acquaintances \nin the street, asking them to remove “anything unsuitable” from his \naccommodation. When he and the others were taken off for questioning,\nand during all the time he endured in solitary confinement, he \nhad no idea whether his request had been carried out or not.27 This \ngnawing anxiety as to whether compromising material has been discovered\nis something D-503, the engineer hero of his futuristic novel \nWe, would suffer; and it is perhaps not insignificant that in the novel \nZamiatin uses the same unusual term, “wing-eared,” to characterise \nthe figure of S-4711, whose role in the revolutionary conspiracy led by \nthe “Mephis” remains deliberately ambiguous.\nAfter the brief preliminary enquiry into his case, he was placed \nin solitary confinement in the prison on Shpalernaia Street. He wrote \nfrom there to his father. In a restrained attempt to console him  — all \nletters from the prison were of course scrutinised by the censor  — he \nmade a remark which scarcely carried much conviction, to the effect \nthat: “Your faith, my dear father, will help you to bear your grief. \nPerhaps your grief will teach me to have better faith.” One observer \nreports that the grief did indeed take its toll on Ivan Dmitrievich, \nwhose health deteriorated through subsequent years. In the same letter\nZamiatin advised his father that when his mother  — who at his \nrequest became the main person who campaigned for his release  — \ncame to St Petersburg, she would be able to find out where he was \nby going to visit the Usova family, whom he described as “very nice, \n', 'Chapter 116\n straightforward people.”28 The rest of Liudmila’s family consisted \nof her mother Elizaveta Ivanovna, and her sister Maria Nikolaevna. \nA medical student like her sister, Maria Nikolaevna also belonged to \nthe RSDWP (b), and she was arrested along with Boris Krylov and \nsome 70 others the day after Zamiatin; Krylov had a printing press \nand 500 proclamations confiscated. Liudmila herself only narrowly \nescaped being arrested early in April 1906, and Zamiatin begged her \nnot to take unnecessary risks, since her imprisonment would cause \nhim such pain. On 17 April 1906 she submitted an appeal to the police \nfor her sister Maria to be released, which was eventually successful.\nZamiatin was officially charged on the last day of December \n1905. As it turned out, his friends had succeeded in emptying his room \nof the compromising materials, and on 19 January 1906 the police \nreported that: “During the search of Zamiatin nothing criminal was \nfound, but in view of his presence in the flat, where according to his \nwords he had come as a correspondent of the New Life newspaper in \norder to obtain material for a newspaper feature from the ‘Office of \nFibre Products,’ there is no basis for drawing a definitive conclusion \nabout his non-participation in planning an offence against the state \nbefore the enquiry has established all the circumstances of the case.” \nMeanwhile, his mother had arrived in the city. Having appealed to the \nDirector of the Polytechnic Institute, Prince A.\u200aG. Gagarin, for support, \nshe submitted a request to the Police Department in late February \nfor her son to be released to live under supervision at home, describing\nhis “chance” association with the political radicals as “a youthful \nindiscretion.”29\nDuring his three months of solitary confinement he made notes \non his reading of philosophical tracts and of studies such as the popular\nGerman psychologist Max Nordau’s book In Search of the Truth \n(Paradoxes);30 he read fiction (Zola, Sienkiewicz), worked to improve \nhis English (which he had started to learn at the Institute), and apparently\nwrote a few poems. The experience of prison, despite the \nphysical discomforts, was not altogether disagreeable. He felt that it \nhad hardened him, and there was also a sense of being caught up in \nan elemental experience:\nHave you ever bathed in the surf? I can recall now the last \ntime I bathed in Jaffa. A huge breaker of a turbid green colour, \ntopped with shaggy white foam, slowly rolls closer and closer  — \nand suddenly with a roar it seizes you in its embrace, hurls you \n', 'Chapter 1 17\nand crushes you and bears you along… You feel like a tiny piece \nof wood in its great power, you are without strength or will, \nand you discover some sort of strange pleasure in your insignificance\nand your powerlessness, a pleasure in giving yourself \nup entirely to the power of this warm, strong monster… A few \nmore surges, and you are thrown out on to the hot sand, under \nthe hot sun… So it was in the heat of Jaffa. And it was something\nlike that in the cold of St Petersburg. It was irksome, and \nyet I was glad, terribly glad about that wave.31\nLiudmila wrote to him and brought parcels, but none of his \nreplies to her from prison survive. He did, however, preserve some \nnotes he made for himself there, which he quoted in one of his letters\nto her after his release. On 12 February 1906 he was reflecting on \nthe importance of living life to the full, in the present, regardless of \nthe consequences: “Should I take care not to waste my life? Look after \nit? So as to extend it for longer? But that would be the same as giving \nsomeone a wonderful piece of music, full of Chopin’s tenderness, the \nfire of Mozart, the bacchanalia of Wagner, the grandeur of Beethoven \nor the melancholy of Tchaikovsky  — and then advising them not to \nplay it all at once, but… just a line each day. […] And the only people \nwho can respond to that wonderful music, full of joy and suffering, \nare those who throw back their heads and drink life down, swallowing\ngreedily, without glancing down to see whether there is much left \nat the bottom, who don’t concern themselves to find out whether they \nare drinking poison or a healing draught…”32\nThanks to his mother’s efforts, Zamiatin was released from \nprison by 13 March, conditional upon his living outside the capital\ncities, and under police supervision. Liudmila and he were able \nto spend 15 hours together during the three days before he had to \nleave St Petersburg for Lebedian’, and his letters that spring are full \nof an anxiety that that time had somehow not been spent well. It was \nscarcely surprising that they should have been awkward together in \nthe circumstances: “we were both somehow strange, somehow different,\nas though somehow we didn’t recognise one another.”33 He had \nbeen reluctant to talk about things, since he was overwhelmed by his \nemotions — not least of frustration and pain at the immediate prospect \nof parting. But he was overjoyed when, having said goodbye near the \nPost Office in the city, she then reappeared at the station to see him off \nproperly.\n', 'Chapter 118\nThe ten surviving letters Zamiatin wrote to Liudmila from \nLebedian’ in the spring of 1906 are particularly revealing.34 Written by \na 22-year-old to the object of his first serious love, they had to perform \na number of functions simultaneously. After all, their brief relationship\nto date was based almost exclusively on three weeks of getting \nto know each other as they pursued their covert revolutionary activities,\nduring which time issues of authority and submission tangled \nwith bursts of jealousy on Zamiatin’s part. The relationship developed\nover the following three months on the basis only of their prison \ncorrespondence, sustained by occasional visits. The few hours they \nhad spent together after his release had been cut short by his internal \nexile to a town 1,000 kilometres away. This was therefore a love affair \nwhich had barely had the time or opportunity to establish itself, and \nhe was determined to keep the small flame alive, even from a great \ngeographical distance. These first letters therefore contain reflections \non their shared past and prospects for the future, and declarations of \nhis feelings, in order to anchor their love in reality; and his loneliness \nin Lebedian’ prompted him to important affirmations about himself, \nan account of his feelings and even his personality, so that she should \nunderstand who it was she had become involved with. They also \ninclude a conscientious  — perhaps even slightly overemphatic — reiteration\nof the revolutionary convictions which had provided the basis \nfor their meeting in the first place.\nIn that first letter of 26 March, in which he had commented on \nbeing free at last, Zamiatin described his longing for work, danger \nand struggle after nearly four months of forced inactivity. He clearly \nexpected that some of his letters might go astray, and for this reason \nhe used a fairly simple code based on the transposition of letters of the \nalphabet when referring to certain political events, such as the forthcoming\nFourth RSDWP (b) Congress, which was held in Stockholm \nthat April.35 In his next letter he was defensive about suggestions \napparently made by the enigmatic Nikolai V. that his commitment \nto the revolutionary cause was superficial or insincere. He countered \nthat although those who are most fanatical about their ideas are likely \nto prove the most active in a revolutionary movement, it is often the \ncase, “as that subtle psychologist Nietzsche correctly observes,” that \nthose with a more active nature may lack creative powers (6 April). \nHe assured Liudmila that prison had only strengthened his resolve to \nserve the Party, and told her that he was proposing to use his period of \nexile to extend his understanding of issues such as the agrarian ques-\n', 'Chapter 1 19\ntion and the role of the Kadets [Constitutional Democrats], as well as \nthe limitations placed on the powers of the proposed Duma by new \ndecrees published that spring. He’d been reading Trotsky’s recently \npublished book One or Two Chambers?, and commented with dismay \non the ill-treatment, reported in the press, of Party comrades. He’d \ndrawn up a list of some fifteen publications he wanted her to send \nhim on top of the socialist newspapers he was already receiving. These \nincluded Bebel, Kautsky and others, variously writing on anarchism \nand socialism, Marx and Nietzsche, marriage and free love, the intelligentsia\nand the proletariat, social democracy and scientific socialism, \nand the agrarian question. He acknowledged that these were not all \nfor his own use, since he hoped to contribute to the cause by lending \nsuch publications to those who wanted to borrow them locally.36\nBy April he had some reason to hope for an amnesty; this was \na proposal which had been mooted in connection with the opening \nsessions of the First Duma (which was dominated by the liberal democratic\nparties, the Socialist Revolutionaries having decided to boycott \nthe elections). He was scornful about the “treachery” of those on the \nLeft who were pressing for collaboration with the Duma. This spirit \nof compromise, he observed, could mark the final defeat of the 1905 \nRevolution. On 9 May, he was still hoping that his own so-called \n“waywardness” would be “generously forgiven.” However, he admitted\nthat he was mostly finding it hard to concentrate on his political \nstudies, since he was too easily distracted by thoughts of her. He \naddressed her fondly as his “dear” or “sweet” “Lyusi,” using a nonstandard\ndiminutive presumably formed as a calque from the English \n“Lucy”; yet at the same time he continued to use the Russian polite \nform Vy rather than the more intimate Ty. At this period in the history \nof Russian manners, this could just have been a conventional courtesy,\nand it is notable that he continued to use it to Liudmila even after \ntheir marriage, and throughout their entire correspondence. Looking \nback again on the difficult hours they’d spent together when he was \nreleased from prison, he apologised for his awkwardness and for his \n“correctness,” which presumably inhibited him from displaying his \ntrue feelings. In his first letter to her certain passages have been cut out, \nand in what has survived he confined himself to requesting a photo of \nher as a schoolgirl and to “pressing her little hand” in parting. He \nwas rarely frank at this stage, preferring to offer her glimpses of transferred\neroticism in his evocation, for example, of supple young spring \nleaves on the trees in the garden, quivering under the tender kisses of \n', 'Chapter 120\nthe rain. But then he immediately became self-conscious, self-mocking:\n“And now, when I’ve written this and read it through, I laugh, I’m \nalmost ashamed! So tell me, it is comical isn’t it, it’s stupid? Or not? I’m \nalways like this. I’m a divided person, I’m split in two. One ‘I’ longs \nto believe, and the other will not allow him to; one longs to feel, and \ndesires beauty, while the other mocks him and points a finger at him. \nOne is soft and warm, the other is cold, sharp, and merciless as steel. \nAnd the cold triumphs, it always has triumphed  — ever since I began \nto be a sentient being. And life has been equally cold. And that’s why \nI’ve always sought novelty, variety, dangers  — otherwise it would all \nhave seemed too cold, too empty” (9 April).\nHe urged her to become a true friend, such as he had never had \npreviously, asked her to trust him like a brother, and to tell him more \nabout how she felt towards him. He was rather appalled to learn that \nMaria, now presumably released from prison and living with her sister \nagain, had been reading his private letters to Liudmila. He evidently \nsensed that she had not been entirely encouraging about their relationship,\nand acknowledged that she was perhaps right to describe him \nas an egoist, a predator constrained only by his code of behaviour as \na member of the intelligentsia. He also asked Liudmila to be indulgent \ntowards his fantasies, pleading that anyone who found themselves \nstuck in Lebedian’ would go mad and start behaving and speaking \nfoolishly. He even developed his own “theory of foolishness,” arguing\nthat deliberate, conscious foolishnesses are productive, just as in \nhigher mathematics, where no hypotheses can be made which do not \na priori contain elements of inaccuracy, approximation and error. In \nother words, reason itself always necessarily contains elements of foolishness.\nBy now he was becoming desperate to get out of Lebedian’, com-\nplaining to Liudmila of “the musty streets of this musty little town, \nwhere you can meet members of the [anti-Semitic] Black Hundreds \norganisation, along with empty-headed maidens who think of nothing\nbut clothes and flirting” (6 April). He was shocked at the sight \nof the local police officers going through intensive training, “all in \nblack, on black horses… They gallop back and forth, hurl themselves \nwith drawn sabres on invisible (because internal) enemies, and learn \nhow to cut people down according to all the rules of the art… They \nhave rifles dangling on their backs, and whips hanging from their \nsaddles…” (22 April). He was finding life at home difficult too, with \na stream of visitors who disturbed him when he tried to settle down \n', 'Chapter 1 21\nto some reading. His sister Aleksandra was about to get married to \na literature teacher from the Lebedian’ gimnaziia, a stern man some 12 \nyears her senior, named Vladimir Volkov. As far as Zamiatin was concerned,\nthis was one of the pressures which was bringing about the \ndisintegration of his family’s life:\nThere is a drama unfolding in my family, a wordless, quiet \ndrama. A drama like Chekhov’s Cherry Orchard, like Uncle Vania. \nThe family is collapsing, the beautiful décor is falling apart, and \nall that are left are old, bare, empty walls.\nMy mother has lived her whole life through her children — \nthrough my sister and me. Now the children have gone  — my \nsister to get married, and I have moved away, towards a different\nand alien life. And she is left standing there, and can see \nnothing in front of her but empty space: she has no purpose in \nlife, and she has no air to breathe. To experience such a thing is \nunbearably hard. But it’s also hard to watch.\nMy sister is someone with high-principled, spiritual needs. \nI had thought to draw her into the circle of the interests which \nI myself live by. She was planning to go to University in the \nautumn… but has got married instead. And it seems to me that \nher husband is made of entirely different stuff, and that she will \nsoon become disillusioned with him. I fear that she feels that \ntoo. And it’s hard to watch that as well.\nAnd I myself am weary. I’m weary because there is no life \nhere to provoke or arouse me, thrill me and prevent me from \nbecoming too absorbed in my thoughts. And sometimes, like \ntoday, it gets to the point where it seems you can’t believe in \nanything, not even in yourself, and there is nothing left in \nyour heart, no energy and no ideas  — it’s as empty there as in \na deserted house… (9 May)\nHis silence about his father in this description is striking, and \nwould seem to betoken a distance between them which did nothing \nto bridge the gulf opening up within the family between mother and \nchildren, brother and sister.\nHe was also not feeling well: he developed flu, and complained \nof headaches, insomnia, and jumpy nerves. But above all, he was \ndetermined to get back to St Petersburg: “After all, the spring months \nof the 23rd year of your life don’t come around twice…” (5 May). He \nwas trapped in Lebedian’ partly by his financial circumstances: “All \n', 'Chapter 122\nI have is just 25 roubles of my own, but to ask my father for money to \nlive in St Petersburg for a cause which he considers to be harmful in \ngeneral, and harmful for me in particular  — I don’t want to do that. […] \nThat’s the reason why I would like to get myself fixed up with practicals\nin Piter [St Petersburg] if possible, or if not, then with a job on the \nSt Petersburg-London route.” He was therefore trying to establish contact\nwith the Dean of the Shipbuilding Faculty, Konstantin Boklevsky, \nknown for his generous interest in his students’ affairs. “The one \nthing I do know is that I won’t last here much longer. I will get away \nand go somewhere. And indeed my inclination to travel draws me as \nwell” (22 April). On 30 May his documents were at last stamped by \na police inspector in Lebedian’, to record his departure, while a further\npolice stamp relating to his temporary registration at an address \nin St Petersburg is dated 4 June. However, he was apparently still not \nentitled to be fully registered in St Petersburg.37 While his exact legal \nstatus at the time is not entirely clear, it seems that the terms of his \ninternal exile were no longer being enforced very rigidly in the atmosphere\nof political relaxation associated with the First Duma.\nIt is notable that the authorities at the Polytechnic were by no \nmeans unsympathetic to the plight of one of their more brilliant, if \npolitically troublesome students, and were to prove very supportive\nof him over a number of years, and even decades. Presumably in \nresponse to his request to Dean Boklevsky for work, Zamiatin was \nsent off within a couple of weeks of his return to St Petersburg to do \npracticals (with a paid stipend) in Finland, at the Sandvik Docks in \nHelsingfors [Helsinki].38 In this way he would avoid the unwelcome \nattentions of the St Petersburg police. He arrived there shortly after \n20 June, as he told Liudmila in his letters, for once again the couple \nfound themselves parted, again after a mere 2–3 weeks, following the \npattern of their frustratingly intermittent relationship. He described \nto her entertainingly how he and his fellow-student, who looked and \nfelt like savages amongst the neat and elegant Scandinavians, visited \nthe sauna there and admired the unselfconscious locals as they swam, \njumped, dived and drank coffee more or less in the nude. He was \nalso impressed by the freedom of the pairs of lovers who embraced \nin the parks in the evenings: he longed to share all this with her, even \nthough she had apparently resolved to spend her holiday with friends \non the Volga for the sake of her health (she was to develop tuberculosis).\n“When I saw those couples I thought of you. I wanted to wander \naround, go out in a boat, sit on the rocks and listen to music  — with \n', 'Chapter 1 23\nyou.” Evidently this particular letter had its intended effect, because \nLiudmila soon changed her plans and joined him. Zamiatin would \nremember that Helsinki summer fondly: “A room with the sea and the \nrocks beneath the window. In the evenings, when you could scarcely \nmake out people’s faces  — they held meetings on the grey granite. At \nnight the faces became invisible, and the warm black stone seemed \nsoft  — because SHE was next to me, and the rays from the floodlights \nat Sveaborg seemed light and tender.”39\nHis comment here about meetings is a reminder that Finland at \nthis time was still very much a part of the Russian Empire, and had \nindeed been subject to increasingly repressive policies of Russification \nsince the turn of the century. The freedoms then won for Russia in \nthe 1905 Revolution were awarded to the Finns as well; but the radicalised\nworkers in the Red Guard led by Johan Kock were pressing \nat this point for more fundamental democratic concessions. Zamiatin \nwas once introduced to Kock  — in the nude  — at the bathing pool. Then \nnews arrived of ominous developments back in Russia: Tsar Nicholas \nII, infuriated by the Duma’s confrontational attitude, had sent in \ntroops to occupy the Taurid Palace, and decreed on 9 July that the First \nDuma should be dissolved. For nearly three weeks there was political\nturmoil in Russia as the revolutionaries strove to incite a mass \nuprising in protest. Nearly half the members of the dissolved First \nDuma crossed into Finland.40 Zamiatin described one of the meetings \nhe attended in Helsinki, which was addressed by the modernist writer \nLeonid Andreev: “It was in 1906. The Revolution had not yet become \na lawful wife, jealously guarding its lawful monopoly on love. The \nRevolution was a youthful, fiery-eyed mistress,  — and I was in love \nwith the Revolution…”41 Andreev’s readers knew him as a short story \nwriter, and turned out in large numbers to hear what he would have \nto say about the political issues of the day. A solemn and articulate \nspeech by the author, in which he foretold the imminent execution of \nthe crowned head of the Russian nation, was greeted with an excited \novation. Soon there was a serious mutiny at the naval base of Sveaborg \nin the Gulf of Finland, and the Tsar sent a naval squadron from \nKronstadt to quell the subversion of the Finnish Red Guard. At some \npoint during these upheavals Zamiatin decided to make his way back \nto St Petersburg in disguise, “wearing different clothes, cleanshaven, \nand in a sort of pince-nez.”42\nThe Tsarist authorities were all too aware of the extent to which \nthe students of the Polytechnic  — and indeed many of the staff  — were \n', 'Chapter 124\nimplicated in revolutionary activities, and they sent spies to monitor\nmeetings held there. The universities had been granted their \nautonomy by the Tsar in August 1905, and the revolutionary parties \nhad become very active on their premises as a consequence.43 On 29 \nSeptember 1906 the Institute received a complaint that a meeting of 42 \nworkers, 56 female students and 15 male students had taken place in \nthe buildings of the Institute the previous week. On 28 October there \nwas a report that a crucial meeting of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party \nhad been scheduled to take place in the Institute the following day: \nDean Boklevsky was instructed to prevent the meeting from taking \nplace, if he wished to avoid the police becoming involved. During \nNovember and December there were further complaints about meetings\ninvolving up to 1,500 people, many of them workers, at which \nprofessors called upon students to support the transfer of land to the \npeople, inflammatory leaflets were distributed, and calls were made \nfor a Constituent Assembly, or for the violent overthrow of the existing \norder; subversive poetry was declaimed and revolutionary songs were \nsung. On one occasion the police authorities protested that, despite \nan explicit request, the Institute’s senior officials, Director Prince \nA.\u200aG. Gagarin and Professor A.\u200aS. Posnikov, had moved far too slowly \nto break up a meeting at one of the Institute hostels, thus allowing five \nworkers and ten female students to escape.44\nWhile all this was happening in the autumn of 1906 Zamiatin \nwas finally back at his classes at the Polytechnic, having established \nhis left-wing credentials and come relatively unscathed through the \nordeals of imprisonment and internal exile. At last he and Liudmila \ncould be together, with only such interruptions as were dictated by \ntheir normal working routines and commitments. He had broken \naway from his home and upbringing, and established himself as an \nindependent adult. And it was at this point, even as he was completing\nhis qualifications as a shipping engineer, that he embarked on an \nentirely new path, and wrote his first piece of fiction, the story Alone, \ninspired by his experiences in prison in December 1905-March 1906.\n']</pre>
