The lack of pressure has always been one of the\ndrawbacks to successfully coping wilh conflagrations in the camp as the\nseveral blocks of ruins on Brougher avenue will testify. Now that this de\nficiency has been supplied it is time for the town trustees to give some at\ntention to the discipline and organization of the fire department, The in\nsurance rales in Tonopah have not been reduced nor will they be reduced\nuntil such time as the citizens of the town demonstrate their capacity for\nself government In taking care of their own households. Up to date this\nhas not been done. Especially in the case of the fire department there has\nbeen a lamentable lack of improvement which can be ascribed only to the\nabsence of discipline due to nepotism which has mortgaged the positions in\nthat service as heirlooms for the officeholders, It would pay the county to\ngive Tonopah the very best talent that can be had to look after the neces\nsary fire protection and there should not be any hesitation about doing so.\nOther cities of greater importance than Tonopah have found it expedient to\ngo outside to secure men specially equipped for this peculiar duty. One case\nof this kind has been Goldfleld where the fire department has maintained a\nhigh record of efficiency that won the confidence of the people and justified\n1 1 county commissioners in dealing generously with requirements of the\nservice. Coldfield contains more flimsy structures than Tonopah. That\ntown lacks the substantial rock buildings that are found on the principal\nBusiness streets of this camp but it is an Incontrovertible fact that Gold\nM has never suffered from a disastrous fire. In nearly every Instance the\nfire department succeeded in restricting the fire to the building where it\noriginated. The secret of this success is that the fire department has been\ntaken out of politics and the head chosen for his recognized ability as\nproven by experience. W hen it was necessary to go outside to produce the\nright talent the county did not pause or hesitate but went about the job\nof naming a responsible head in the most deliberate manner. Beginning first\nby consulting the underwriters, the citizens advisory committee sifted out\nthe candidates until they found one who was capable of organizing and main\ntaining an organization on the highest standard.\nThe Tonopah Bonanza hears no ill will to any one but it is here to\nstay ana stay without regard to persecution or moHecntinn Thm iu\ndenying that the county and town are sadly in need of reorganization in the\ninterest of economy and this paper is going to stay with the job until its\nObjects are accomplished.\nCAMPAIGN AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS\nLEADS TO THE EDUCATION OF WORKERS\nIlly Associated Press.)\nWASHINGTON, D. C, May 13.\nPlans for the extension of the anti\ntuberculosis campaign among the\nworking men and women of the coun\ntry were outlined by Dr. Charles J.\nHatfield, the executive secretary of\nthe national association for the study\nand prevention of tuberculosis, in an\naddress before the sociological sec\ntion of the association here last even\ning. Dr. Hatfield said:\n"Local tuberculosis relief associa\ntions among the working men\' and wo\nmen of this country have for the most\npart taken four forms: those in which\nthe-employes and the employer have\nbolh contributed on a more or less\nfixed basis; those in which the em\nployers only have contributed; those\nIn which the working men have ap\npealed to the general community for\nthe establishment of a sanatorium;\nand those in which the labor unions\nhave controlled the work for the re\nlief of fellow members. There are\nbesides there four forms of organiza\ntion the large number of general bene\nfit associations in shops and stores,\nand the splendid work of the large\ninternational unions such as the typo\ngraphical, printing pressmen, photo\nengravers, cigarmakers and others.\n"In Hartford and other Connecticut\ncities a form of organization has\ngrown hp in which the workers con\ntribute whatever they are able to a\nfree tuberculosis bed fund, and the\nemployers generally equal the joint\ncontribution of their employees. This\nmoney is then used in treatment of tu\nberculous men and women in state\nIcanatoria, so that by offering treat\nment at reduced rates, the state aiso\nin effect contributes a share.\n"The National association urges that\nin every industrial city and town some\nspecial effort be made to organize the\nworking men and women In the anti\ntuberculosis campaign. This organlza\ntion should preferauy be under con\ntrol and leadership of the local central\nanti-tuberculosis association and it\nshould have the following features:\n"A plan at collection of funds which\nwould bring contributions both from\nemployes and from employers.\n"A system of periodic medical ex\namination so arranged that, it would\ndiscover and control early cases of\ntuberculosis and other diseases, and j\nthat it would also provide for the suit\nable employment of the convalescent\nworker. ,\n"A division of responsibility which\nwould throw much of the care of re\nlief of the tuberculosis working men\nupon the shoulders of the special or\nganizations of the men themselves.\n"The opportunity to collect statisti\ncal material should be recognized and\nthe working men themselves should\nbe impressed through every possible\nmeans the necessity and desirability\nof this type of co-operation."\n.

The best\ncriterion of the class "of business men in that community was afforded by\nthe experience of Ooldfleld eight years ago during the session of the Mining\nCongress in. that town. San Erancisco was interested in making the affair a\n. ii ns u,e nrsi ume ;nat the Mining Congress had found\na mining camp sufficiently stable to entertain the thousand delegates who\nusually attend the deliberations. Therefore San Francisco came rf,,w lto\nthe desert with a special train and a brass band of thirty pieces and pro\nceeded to boost for the gold camp. Goldfleld about that time had been con\nnected with Los Angeles by a direct line of railroad and the citizens of Gold\nfield thought it would be a good stroke of business to Invite the southern\nbrokers to come as their guests. The reply was received thai the alleged\nmining exchange could not entertain the invitaion, but would cheerfully\ncome providing all bills and expenses were guaranteed. Goldfleld could not\nback out. A special train was ordered, the services of the local brass band\nwere placed at the disposal of the pikers who came to the tune of two Bcore\nor more. These visitors did not spent a cent during their stay but could al\nways be found in the front row whenever the feed troughs were filled They\nstaid with the game until the funds ran out and Goldfleld was on the point\n,of kicking out their southern guests when a clever railroad man suggested\na scheme by which the last resort could be avoided. The Los Angeles dele\ngates were quietly told that the time limit of their passes had run out and\nthat they would have to leave on the next train. That was the only way\nGoldfleld got rid of the Los Angeles \'mining men" who knew more about\na free lunch than they knew about a hole in the ground. Ever since that\nGoldfleld and Tonopah smile when tjie Mine of Los Angeles is mentioned.\nThe more the merrier.
