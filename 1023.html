Kecidence. 91.\nThe most important part of the human system is the blood. Every mus\ncle, nerve, tissue, bone and sinew is dependent on this vital fluid for nour\nishment and strength necessary to maintain them in health and enable each\nto perform the diilerent duties nature requires. Even the heart, the very\nengine \' of life, receives its vigor and motive power from the blood. Since\nso much is dependent on this vital fluid it can very readily be seen how\nnecessary it is to have it pure and uncontaminated if we would enjoy the\nblessing of good health. Bad blood is responsible for most of the ailments\nof mankind ; when from any cause it becomes infected with impurities,\nhumors or poisons, disease in some form is sure to follow. Muddy, sallow\ncomplexions, eruptions, pimples, etc.. show that the blood is infected with\nunhealthy humors which have changed it from a pure, fresh stream to a\nsour, acrid fluid, which forces out its impurities through the pores and\nglands of the skin. A very common evidence of bad blood is sores or ulcers,\nwhich break out on tue flesh, often\nfrom a very insignificant bruise or\neven scatch or abrasion. If the blood\nwas pure and healthy the place would\nheal at once, but being loaded with\nimpurities, which are discharged into\nthe wound, irritation and inflamma\ntion are set up and the sore continues.\nBad blood is also responsible for\nAnaemia, Boils. Malaria, etc.; the\nweak, polluted circulation eantrot fur\nnish the nourishment and strength\nrequired to sustain the bod and a\ngeneral run-down condition of health\nresults. S. S. S. is nature\'s blo-d\npurifier and tonic; made entirely of\nhealintr, cleansing roots and herbs.\nIt goes down into the circulation and removes every particle of impurity,\nhumor or poison that may be there, restores lost vitality, and steadily tones\nup the e-Hve system. It adds to the blood the healthful properties it is in\nneed of, and in every way assists in the cure of disease. S. S.

DEAVENPORT, Editor.\nSubscription - - - $1.00 Per Yea\nFRIDAY JANUARY 20\nInspection of Weights.\nOne of the crying needs of Mis\nsissippi today is a system of in\nspection for weights and measures.\nThere are statutes on the lnks\nprescribing a standard for weights\nami measures of all kinds, but they\nare not enforced lecause of the\nlack of a system of inspection.\nAs a consequence, Mississippi\'\nstandards are anything your butch\ner, your grocer, your produce\ndeader, or other persons from whom\nyou purchase the necessaries; of life\nmay e.- tit to set.\nMake inuuiry in anv town in this\nState and you will hear multitude\nof complaints ahout shortage in\nweights and measure.\nI \'ideas you have scales and meas\nures in your own home, it is next\nto impossible to tell when you are\ngetting a square deal. Buy a\ntwenty five-cent steak from your\nbutcher, and as likely as not you\nwill get a hare twenty cents.\' worth.\nInvest in ten pounds of sugar and\nyou will frequently i\'md that you\nhave ha rely nine pounds.\nThese, shortages are not always\ndue to intentional dishonesty on\nthe part of the dealer. The Daily\nNews Irt lievesj that a large majority\nof the business men of Mississippi\nare thoroughly honest, and would\nnot knowingly take, advantage of a\ncustomer. At the same time we\nbelieve that a majority of our busi\nness men are notoriously careless\naliout weights and measures, es\npecially the farmer, and their scales\nare rarely, if ever, submitted to a\ntest for the purpose of determining\nt heir accuracy.\nFor in-tance, go into the average\nmeat market and you will find in\nuse the ordinary coil spring scale\npurchased by the dealer through th\nlarge packing houses. Did it ever\noccur to you that this spring will\nlieconie weakened by constant usage.\nHave you ever stopped to think that\nsteel contracts in winter and ex\npands in summer, and as a result\nyou often buy a literal quanity of\nweather with your morning steak\nor dinner roast?\nWe have a railroad commission\nin this State to see to it that we are\nnot imposed uion by the common\ncarriers, ft is ten times more im\npoitant to the average citizen that\nfie get a square deal from the man\nwho furnishes him with the neces\nsaries of life, and he cannot reason\nably expect n square deal unless the\nbusiness methods of the man from\nwhom he makes purchases are\ngiven reasonable supervision.\nThe saving to individuals that\nwould quickly follow a first-class\nsystem of inspection for weights and\nmeasures would amount to more in\none day than the system would cost\nthe taxpayers for an entire year.\nIt is useless to have statutes on our\nl)nka unless we also provide means\nfor their enforcement. The next\nlegislature should give this subject\nits very careful consideration.\nJackson News.\nIt requires a proper combination of\ncertain acids with natural digestive\njuices to perfect a dyspepsia cure.\nAnd this is what Kodol is a perfect\ndigester that digests all the food you\neat.
