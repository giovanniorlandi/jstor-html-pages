C, May 31, 1907.\nAll railroads of any import\nance in the state that are af\nfected by the new rate are kick\ning, but the Southern will get all\nthe blame because it was first to\nstart the ball to rolling.\nFrom reports being published\nin many of the papers of the\nState it appears that some of the\nState officers are not going to\nstand for re-election, which will\nstrengthen the precedent that\nthey should only serve two terms\nFor a long time efforts have\nbeen made to get Speaker Can\nnon to come to North Carolina,\nand as he does appear to be\nproud of the fact that he is\nnative of the state we suppose\nhe came so that he woulb be let\nalone.\nWe regret that Messrs. Ship\nman and Sherrill are candidates\nfor the same position, lor we\nwould like to vote for them both\nEither would fill the position of\nLalor Commissioner w ith credit.\nbeing well qualified for the po\nsition.\nWhile the merchants of Dur\nham are fighting for cheaper\nfreight rates-, which they should\nhave, we see no reasons why\nthey should not do something\nabout the price of telephones,\nwhich will now cost business\nhouses $4 per month and resi\ndences $2.50.\nThe Inter-State Telephone\nCompany of this city are going\nup another notch in the rates.\nThe Bell telephone people may\nbe robbers and all that, but one\nthing is certain, when they were\nhere doing business the Inter\nState Company charged only a\nlittle more than half what they\nare now charging. The directors\nclaim that they are not making\nany money, but do not explain\nhow it was when they were char\nging such low prices while the\nBell Company were doing busi\nness here.\nIn some of our exchanges,\nnotably the Lexington Dispatch\nand Statesville Landmark, they ,\nora Ao\'vmXnrr iUa irrantn t.(Tr.t:\nshould be made to induce people\nto patronize home merchants,\nPeople should patronize people\nof the home town whenever they\nget what they want, but our ex-1\nperienceis that the home mtr-1 his orthtrn neighbor as a dam\nchant lays where he can get it J yankee.

B. Varner would not\nbe a candidate for re-election to\nthe office of Commissioner of\nLabor and Printing, two candi\ndates have announced that they\nare in the race for the position,\nnamely, Meters. John U. Sher\nrill, of the Concord Times, and\nEtii n. U tm !;\nMr. Varner\'s assistant for . some\ntime. Following is from the\nConcord Tribune of May 27th:\nIt is announced that Henry B.\nVarner will not be a candidate\nfor the nomination for Commis\nsioner of Labor and Printing,\nand we take this time and oppor\ntunity to suggest that the proper\nthing to do is to nominate and\nelect John B. Sherrill to that of-\nLfice. It has been a long time, if\never, that Carrabus has had a\nrepresentation onlthe State ticket\nand this is our opportunity, for\nwe can nominate and elect the\nConcord editor. The State could\nbe searched from border to bor\nder and a better equipped man\nfor this place could not be found.\nHe has the business qualities de\nmanded by the office and would\nbe a pleasing representative of\nthe publishers and newspaper\ncraft. While more might be\nsaid, this is sufficient to ask the\npublishers of the State to take\nup the suggestion and nominate\nSherrill.\nFollowing is from Mr. Ship\nman s announcement that he is\nin the race for the position:\nMr. Varner announces that he\nwill not stand for re-election as\nCommissioner of Labor and\nPrinting, and I have decided to\nbecome a candidate for the place,\nsubject of the action of the\nDemocratic State Convention.\nAs you are doubtless aware, I\nhave already spent nearly three\nyears\' time in familiarizing my\nself with the work of the depart\nment, and there are no duties\nconnected with any feature of\nthe same that I do not feel per\nfectly competent of performing\nto the best interest of the people\nof the State. I have gone to the\nexpense of moving my family to\nRaleigh and am devoting my en\ntire time to the work.\nWith regard to the suggestion\nof the Concord Tribune that Mr.\nJohn B. Sherrill, proprietor "and\neditor of The Concord Times,\nbe nominated and elected Com\nmissioner of Labor and Printing,\nfor which Mr. Varner will not be\na candidate again, it is to be said\nthat Mr. Sherrill is thoroughly\nqualified to discharge the duties\nof the office and if he wants\nshould have it.

A wag\non came creaklug ajt bis heels, slowly\noverhauling him and unexpectedly\nstopping when It did so. It was green\nmountains high with country vege\ntables smelling notably !n the clean\nnight air, and with this sweet whiff\nof home and the past there came a\nhearty, elderly voice evidently hailing\nTom. . \'\n"Now, then, young man, If you want\na lift. Joomp oop!"\nTom was not sure what he wanted,\nbut his feet were sore, the voice liked\nhim, and up he Jumped. And between\nSarkness and dawn the quiet foot of\nthe sleeping hill and the half awaken\ned but already noisy purlieus of Tot\ntenham Court road the lucky, attrac\ntive fellow made another friend. ,\nThe wagoner was a red faced, red\nwhiskered, freckle handed fellow, with\na genial, broad, communicative tongue.\nJonathan Kutterfleld was his name,\nand he was a Vorfcshireman only re\ncently come south, as he said, with a\neigh which left him silent Whereup\non Tom became communicative In his\nturn and remarked that he, too. medi\ntated a move to India.\n"There\'s the good ship Jean advertis\ned to sail on Monday, and I\'m on my\nway to the office to see If they\'ve a\nbunk left If there Isn\'t I shall go on\nto the docks and try my luck on the\nship herself.

He writes u canny\nletters, but dear knows what we\'d\ngive to see him back!"\nBut there was no end to the good\nwill of the Yorkshireman. who not on\nly Insisted on paying for hot coffee at\nan early stall, but flatly refused to go\nabout his business until Tom promised\nto accompany him to breakfast at Us\nconclusion.\nTom\'s heart rose steadily with the\nsun and was singing with brave re\nsolve when at length the wagoner re\nturned. "I doubt I\'ve lieen a long time," said\nButterfietd. "It I very near 6\no\'clock."\n"Ten past" said Tom, whipping out\nthe golden nucleus of his future for\ntunes, which be had even then been\nbugging in his pocket.\nTom tried to back out of the break\nfast, tmt it failed. He tried again as\nthey drove past Fetter lane he could\npay his way in noils buildings now\nbut this time the wagoner whipped up\nhis horse and refused to listen.\n\'Xo, no, said be; "a promise Is a\npromise, and I warrant they\'ll be\npron 1 to see you."\n"You mean your wife aiid faml\'yl"\nsaid Tom.\n"Nay." said ButternVId, "I doubt\nyou\'ll not we them there."\n"Not at your bouse?" cried Tom.\n"It Isn\'t mine," confessed the other.\n"It\'s my wife\'s brother\'s.

His shoes were\nstill where he had kicked them off.\nHe slipped luto them ami, exerting all\nhis strength, pulled the large Iron bed\'\nmean rrom Its place and wedged It\nbetween wall aud door. Then he\ncrouched aud listened. The man was\nfor taking him single handed, the wo\nman evidently restraining him by main\nforce.\n"Let tne go! Let me go!"

The last Tom heard wn\nthe belaboring of the locked, blocked\ndoor by hmit Jim. Nor did his prei-\nnce of mind ilesrt him yet. He walk\ned out of the narrow side street, only\nrunning when he came to tlit main\nthoroughfare and after a perilous hesi\ntation as to whether lie should strike\nInto the city or over Itlackfrlars bridge.\nHe chose the city and, having chosen.\nlost his head ami ran for bis life.\nHe darted across the street and\nplunged Into the busy alleys filling\nthe delta between the bridge and St\nPaul\'s.

The newcomer iat panting in\na comer, the perspiration trickling\nfrom his nose.\nBut Ills head was cottier. He saw\nthe Heedlessness as well as the indis\ncretion of conspicuous flight. He had\nSlipiied through the only hands that\nwere as yet against him. He had\neluded the only eyes lie need avoid that\nnight, for the hackney coachman might\ntake his new tale straight to Scotland\nYard, but it could hardly be given to\nthe world before morning.\nTom\'s heart leaped as he discovered\nthe temjMirary strength of his position.\nNext moment It sank, for the cad was\ncollecting the fares, and his single as\nset was the watch. His bankrupt state\nhad occurred to Tom as he ran for the\nomnibus, but not egain. It was so\nsmall a thing compared with the charge\nnow lying a; his door. Vet he had just\nthought of it-hi,s little fraud was so\nfar deliberate but he had neither the\nface nor the fooHmr-liness to sit there\naud confess bis fai\'t. And, situated\nlike the wanted felon he now felt him\nself to 1h, it was wonderful aud hor\nrible lmw a felon\'s resources came nn-\nbidden to his fingers\' ends. He began\nfeeling in pocket after ixx-ket, with a\nface that lengthened under the frown\nof the cad, the raised eyebrows of the\nrubicund gentleman and the fixed at\ntention of all.\n"I\'m afraid I-I don\'t seem to have\na coin in my ywket!"\n"Oh, you \'aven\'t.

And the cad winked nt the\nother passengers, stopped the omni\nbus and called a policeman from the\ncurb.\nloin could hare burst into tears. To\n1 wrondy wanted for a crime so ter\nrible and justly taken for a thins ao\nsmall! He" looked forlornly nt his fel\nlow passengers, with a wild Idea that\none might come to bis rescue. The\nsole resjionsc was a withering frown\nfrom the ruddy old gentleman, who\nalso commended the cad and loudly\ntrusted an example would le made of\nthe case. The desperate Tom began\nransacking his pocket In earnest for\nsome overlooked coin, but he had done\nthis so often of late that he felt the\nfutility now.
