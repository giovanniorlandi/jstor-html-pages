Arrangements were made for a joint session at 1\no\'clock this afternoon. The proclamation follows :\n"My Fellow Countrymen: The armistice was signed this morn\ning.

This stops the movement\nduring the next five days of 252.000 men and sets aside all the calls\nfor November.\nFRONTIERS GUARDED TO PREVENT ESCAPE OF HUN\nMILLIONAIRES\nCOPENHAGEN, November 10 Another attempt on the life of\nPrince Henry of Prussia has been made at Flensburg, where he was\nin seclusion in a villa. The result of the attempt is not known, but\nit is believed that he escaped.\nAccording to a frontier message, Princess Heinrich, wife of the\ngrandson of Ludwig III, of Bavaria, was wounded in the arm when\nfired upon as she was fleeing from Munich.. She and her husband\nare now hiding in southern Bavaria with the Princess Adelphi, wifo\nof Prince Adelbert, Emperor William\'s third son.\nThe Danish frontier is being strongly guarded by the German\nsoldiers\' council. This is being done, it is stated, in order to prevent\nthe escape of rich people, generals and other high officers.\nAll national cockades and the eagle on the helmets of soldiers\nhave been removed, being replaced by a red band.\nThe wearing of the iron cross has been strictly prohibited.\nBerlin was occupied by forces of the soldiers\' and workmen\'s\ncouncils on Saturday afternoon, according to a Wolf bureau report\nreceived here.\nThe railway stations in the entire industrial districts of Germany\nfrom Dortmund to Duisburg have been occupied by soldiers\' coun\ncils, according to a dispatch from Essen. There were no disorders.\nGerman guard vessels in the mine fields off the great belt and\nlittle belt have left their stations. The crews forced the officers to\nleave the vessels and then hoisted the red flag.\nSix more cruisers flying the red flag arrived at Hamburg last\nnight, says a Wolf News Agency dispatch received here. The city of\nHamburg is generally quiet.\nIt is stated that Huga Haase, Socialist leader in the Reichstag,\nhas the situation in Hamburg in hand.\nEmperor William\'s abdication was received on Saturday after\nnoon at Berlin with general rejoicing which was tempered by the\nfear that it had come too late.\nFriederich Ebert, the Socialist leader, has been appointed im\nperial chancellor. He has issued a proclamation saying that he plans\nto form a people\'s government which will endeavor to bring about a\nspeedy peace.\nKAISER, STRIPPED OF ALL POWER FLEES TO SAFETY IN\nHOLLAND\nThe German people, for a generation the obedient and submis\nsive servants of their war loard, for more than four years his pliant\ninstruments in ravaging the world, have spoken a new word, and the\nold Germany is gone. From the confused, sometimes conflicting and\noften delayed advices from Germany in the last two days, it has now\nbecome apparent that William, emperor and king, has been stripped\nof his power. He is now plain William Hohenzollern, a fugitive in\nHolland. With his fall topples into ruin William\'s mad design to\nrule the world.\nLITTLE KNOWN OF SITUATION\nLittle is known of the situation today in Germany for that coun\ntry is in the first days of its new adventure. It is not clear whether\nthis old regime has been permanently dislodged or whether the new\nauthorities, with the unscrupulous adroitness which has long marked\nGerman politics, are merely sacrificing the chief figurehead or kais\ncrism in the hope of obtaining and easier peace. It appears probable,\nthat no one in Germany knows, and that it is still to be determined\nwhich of the contending elements will gain the upper hand. -\nRevolution is spreading rapidly, and from the fact that a So\ncialist is now chancellor it may be gathered that the object of the\nrevolution is not merely the quick ending of the war but the com\nplete severance of the political ties which still bind the nation with\nits past.\nPROBLEM HAS CHANGED\nFor the Allies the problem has changed. The countries which\nfought Germany and her vassals for more than four years have\nemerged from it completely triumphant, but within the borders of\nthe countries which menaced the peace of the whole world stalks re\nvolt, famine and anarchy. The world\'s next task may be to restore\nrder in the desolated Central Empires. It may be the lot of the forces\nwho have successfully contested Germany\'s greed for power to save\nher from the fate she imposed on Russia. Likewise help will have to\nbe given Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, whos ruin Germany\nwrought.\nTh German empire was the last of the great autocracies whose\nall marks the real significance of the war. In Russia, Austria-Hungary,\nand finally in Germany, irresponsible power gave way before\nthe irresistible forces of democracy. Germany, holding on to the last,\nkept up the hopeless struggle until Field Marshal Von Hindenburg\'s\nprophetic words early in the war came true.\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\nMARSHAL FOOH\'S OKI.EK\nENDING HOSTILITIES\nLondon, November 11 Mar\nshal Foch the Allied general\nissmo, hua Issued the follow\ning order:\n"To the Coiniiiander-iii-Clilcf :\nHostilities ill cease on the\nwhole, front no front Xo.rew\nher II at 11 o\'clock a. m.\n(French time.)

In other words German toys would\nhave to come into this country on precisely the same terms as similar\nimportations from France or England, and other products would\nreceive the same generous treatment.\nThe American people see a difference between toys made by a\nnation whose soldiers find pleasure in cutting off the hands of chil\ndren and impalling babies on their bayonets, and those manufac.\ntured by the peasants of a country that has endured the trials and\nsacrifices of France.

Difficulties\niroRe between Mr. Ferris and the officials of the Board with (lie re\nsult that he was forced to severe his connection with the Government\nBut some of his shins were built and placed in service. The Coyote,\none olthe first of the Ferris type ships has recently completed n\nvoyage to a North Atlantic island with a cargo of coal weighing\n3,032 tons. During the trip she passed unscathed through the worst\nhurricane that has visited those waters since 189!). The Coyote bears\nseveral distinctions. She is the first wooden ship to be turned out\nat an Atlantic yard, the first to make a voyage with cargo, and the\ndeepest draft vessel ever taken into the harbor of the port she visit\ned. Naturally Mr. Ferris, her designer, must feel a certain amount\nof satisfaction that his ideas have been so thoroughly proven. Those\nresponsible for his separation from the service would have done wel\nhad they ignored the comparatively inconsequential causes that\nbrought about that action, and retained in the personnel of the Ship\nping Board an expert of such demonstrated ability.\nFEARFULLY COMPOUNDED\n"Hoover Permits Serving of Hash." news headline.

Edgerly\nstepped Into a neat, homelike western\nfarmhouse, one morning in midsum\nmer. She caused something of a sen\nsation and aroused more or less sus\npicion by bringing with her many\ntrunks filled with canvases, paints,\nand souvenirs of foreign travel, as\nwell as queer garments that later\nwere to cause a sensation in West\nvllle. The odd garments were Eng\nlish riding breeches, which were to\nhe worn In the most extraordinary\npastime ever Indulged In by their own-\'\ner.\nA duy\'s stay on the farm revealed\nshortage. The oats were ready for\nharvesting and it was impossible, to\nhire any extra "help". Five or six\nfamilies owned a thresher and other\nmachinery In common and they had\nrevived the old system of cooperation\nthat results In what used to be called\n"bees," all concentrating on a field\nuntil the grain had been safely garn\nered.\nFor years Mrs. Edgerly had been in\nterested in studying labor problems.\nShe had theories about one\'s relation\nto the land and the situation which\nconfronted her seemed to make a dis\ntinct appeal.\nSh\'e decided to volunteer as a\n"hand." The farmer to whom she\nninde the offer of assistance accepted\nher on probation, for he was becoming\naccustomed to the necessity that made\nills wife and daughters valuable aids\nIn the lighter forms of field labor, and\nthe artist who is tall, straight, and\nathletic, appeared to be promised as\nn helper.\nIt was when the new "hand" report\ned for work In the field that her attire\ncaused a sensation. Mrs. Edgerly wore\nher riding breeches, her riding boots\nand a sleeveloss Jacket. The members\nof tho five families who had assembled\nfor the "bee" looked askance at the\ncostume, for the regular farmerette\nbloomers had not been introduced in\nto that part of the State. The artist\nwas assigned to work with a girl\nhnol teacher, a daughter of ono of\nthe farmers. She describes her exper\nience with enthusiasm,\n"I was told to take up two bundles\nof oats, carrying one under each arm\nwith with the heads pointed in front\nof mo and to stack them carefully, six\nin a row, then one on each end, and\nnn extra one on top to cover thein Hml\nshed the rain," she said, when she re\nturned to Washington for a few days.\n"Ily the time I had finished two shocks\nI was warm and tired.

The mine Is the property of the Gold\nfield Consolidated Mines of Nevada.\nThurs far operations have been con\nfined to a thorough prospect. This\nprospect was found satisfactory, and\nthe mine was purchased. Until gold\nmining conditions grow better, how\never, the property was ordered closed.\nA short time ago a portion of the\nwall gave way. After the cave had\nbeen cleaned up the area was sampled\nnnd the report of the assuyists showed\nthat a second ledge even richer than\nthe first had been found. It is now\nconsidered possible that, despite the\nunfavorable conditions for gold min\ning, the property may be worked.\nTEBRlBLlSWOLLEN\nSuffering Described As Tortnre\nRelieved by Black-Drangbt.\nRossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, ol\nthis place, writes: "My husband is an\nengineer, and once while lifting, he in\nlurcd himself with a piece of heavy ma\nchinery, across the abdomen. He was\nso sore he could not bear . to press on\nhimself at all, on chest or abdomen. He\nweighed 1G5 lbs., and fell off until he\nweighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.\nHe became constipated and it looked\ntike he would die. We had three different\ndoctors, yet with all their medicine, his\nbowels failed to act. He would turn up\na ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink\nit two or three days in succession. He\ndid tliis yet without result. We became\ndesperate, he suffered so. He was swol\nlen terribly. He told me his suffering\ncould only be described as torture.\nI sent and bought Thedford\'s Black\nDraught. 1 made him take a big dose,\nand when it began to act he fainted, he\nwas in such misery, but he got relief and\nbegan to mend at once. He got well,\nand we both feel he owes his life to\nThedford\'s Black-Draught."\nThedford\'s Black-Draught will help you\nto keep fit, ready for the day\'s work.\nTryitl NC-131\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooco\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\nFor This Week Only\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\nBest grades of Children\'s Hose 25c to 35c.\nChildren\'s Union Suits, all sizes, 95c.\nExtra large Blankets $3.75.\nHeavy Dark and light outing 30c.\nApron Gingshams 18c to 25c,\nBleached Muslin, 20c, 23c, 27c.\nBest grade of Pepperel Sheeting 10x4 65o.\nSpecial low prices on Ladies\' Suits, and\nCoats,\nLadies\' Hose 15c to $1.75.\nLadies\' Union Suits $1.25 to $1.95.\nHeavy large Blankets $3.75.\nBest grade of Cheviots 29c.\nCalicos 20c.\nUnbleached Muslin 20c, 22c, 25c.\nBest grade of Dress Ginghams 18c to 35o.\nIf in need of any rubber goods, we are sole\nagents for Ball Band Rubbers.\niilaysville Suit & Dry\nGoods Co.\n(Incorporated)\n24 West Second Street\n2 Store Closes af6 P.

This\nresults almost entirely from the work\nof the Federal authorities In combat\ning the nest.\nEquine influenza Is a common dis\nease In the large cities of the country,\naffecting horses which pass through\ninfected stables of dealers. Only,\nhowever, under certain influences not\nunderstood and when larse numbers\nof horses in commercial channels arc\nexposed to contagion, does it assume\nan enzootic or epizootic form. I\'nlike\ncertain other inTectioiis diseases, one\nattack of influenza does not grant a\nlasting immunity. However, previous\nattack or attacks or other unassign\nable reasons apparently make old\nhorses less susceptible than young\nones.\nHistory Indicates that this disease\nhas been recognized in various out\nbreaks for several hundred years past.\nEven before the Christian Era, a se\nvere epizootic believed to be influenza,\nis recorded .as having occurred in Sic\nily, and again fn A. D. 1301 it spread\nover a considerable period of Italy,\ncausing great loss among the war\nhorses of Rome. In 1048 the disease\naffected Germany and spread to other\nparts of Europe, and in 1711 it follow\ned the tracks of the great armies all\nover Europe, causing immense losses\namong the horses. Other extensive\noutbreaks obtained at Intervals from\nISIS to 1883, one of which was that of\n1870,73, in connection with the Franco-Prussian\nWar. The first recorded\nappearance of equino influenza in\nNorth America was In 1766. Probably\ntho most severe outbreak, however,\nwas that of 1870-7:!, when it spread\nover the entire country from Canada,\nsouth to Ohio, and then eastward to\nthe Atlantic coast and westward to\nCalifornia, although the severity of\ntho outbreak of l!t()0-01 should not\nbe overlooked. In these epizootics,\nthere was a heavy loss of horses, and\noeing prior to introduction of the mo\ntor truck in city commerce, business\nin the great commercial centers of the\ncountry was seriously Inconvenienced,\nand in some cases practically sus\npended for lack of available horses\nLike the Influenza epidemics in the\nhuman family, epizootics of equine in\nfluenza are difficult to control. The\ntrue primary cause of the disease has\nnot been established, though it is gen\nerally believed to be due to a specific\ngerm, too small to be detected under\nthe highest power miseroscope. It\ncertainly has the characteristic of ex\ntreme diffusibllity, leading to \'spread\nof disease over a large area of the\ncountry In a few duys, the outbreak\nrunning its course despite all efforts\nto prevent It, and the infection grad\nually subsiding without assignable\ncause.\nThe symptoms are those of fever, in\nsome cases, preceded by a chill. There\nis great prostration and depression of\nmuscular force; the visible mucous\nmembrances, especially those of the\neye, become a deep saffron, ocher, or\nviolent red color, from which fact\nthe term "pinkeye" has been given\ntho disease. There is a grat diminu\ntion or total loss of appetite and a\nrapid loss of flesh, which frequently\nreaches 30 to 75 pounds for each 21\nhours. In uncomplicated cases, the\nfever abates after 6 to 10 days, and\nthere is a general restoration to\nhealth. The death rate is relatively\nlow (during the epidemic of 1872 vary\ning from 2 to 7 per cent), tho higher\nrate occurring among city horses. The\ncomplications are many and some\ntimes serious. Among such are those\nof the Intestines and lungs. Pneu-\nIn The "Huts"\njliere and over there the American soldier and sailor\nfind recreation, home and church cheer, school and\ncollege, and the best of club life and the stage.\nNot least of the Camp helps is the "eats" provided for the boys, especially\ngood things from the homeland. Often a happy group may be seen enjoying\na dish of Grape-Nuts, a delicious and nutritious food that makes thousands\nhappy every day "at home."\nThis is War Charities ; WeeR\nFunds for war aid work are- being pooled and mobilized to help win the\nwar for tha United States and the Allies.\nHelp the folks who are helping the fighters at the front.\nSubscribe to the Joint Fund\nmonia, one of the frequent complica\ntions, is always serious, as it affects\nthe animal when reduced in strength\nand resisting power.\nTHE QUALITY OF THE\nPRESENTCORN CROP\nIs .Much Superior To That of Last\nYour, Report Says October\nWeather Conditions ltcspon\nsilile For lliir Increase In\nFederal Estimutc.\nL V U fc. -.jl V\' W LJ 1 4 y ni Ur L-l\nWashington, November 9 October\nweather conditions resulted In an in\ncrease of 30,000,000 bushels in the\ncountry\'s crop of corn.

Mr. Morgan recommended that\nthe Fiscal Court appoint a represcnta\ntl?e in each precinct together with\nt ree representatives of the Chamber\nof Commerce, to constitute a county\nb ard that would meet once each\nmonth and advise with the County\nAgent, relative to the work being\ndone. This the Fiscal Court did and\nMr. Morgan sent Mr. Kirk during Oc\ntober, at the expense of the Experi\nmental Station so the Board could In\nterview him and ascertain whether he\nwas the proper man for Mason coun\nty. From the start Mr. Kirk made a\nmost favorable impression with the\nBoard and they recommended his re\ntention by the Fiscal Court, which was\ndone.\nWe have, on numerous occasions,\nheard people Inquire as to the duties\nof a County Agricultural Agent, and\nwa doubt if all the farmers of Mason\ncounty really know what the United\nStates, State of Kentucky and Fiscal\nCourt of Mason county are trying to\ndo for them through the employment\nof the County Agricultural Agent.\nFirst of all, let me state Mr. Kirk\nIs no "Paper Farmer," which term Is\napplied to men who can tell you how\nto do a thing (from the literature they\nthey have read) but have never had\npractical experience on the farm. Mr.\nKirk\'s father was formerly a native of\nMason county and Mr. Kirk was\nraised on the farm, experiencing all\nthe enjoyments and hardships of farm\nlife.

T. Crowe, of\nCovington, was in the act of shoveling some coal into the stoker and\nthe firebox door was blown off, striking him, fracturing his shoulder\nand head and knocking him off the engine, he dying this morning; and\nBrakeman William Dyer also of Covington, who was riding in the\nengine, and who was badly scalded about the face and body.
