These\ngrounds are situated midway be\ntween Gulfport and Biloxi. The\nmembers of the Club have spent\nlarge sums in beautifying this\nplace. The citizens of Gulf\nport not only give the use of the\ngrounds free, but also provide\nwater, electric lights, sewerage\nand shower baths and in addition\nmade up a purse of $1500 to be\nused towards paying the ex\npenses of the encampment. The\ngrounds are right on the Gulf of\nMexico affording ample bathing\nfacilities. Mayor Donnell, of\nHattiesburg, and a commit\ntee of gentlemen went to\nGulfport and offered General\nYates and Mr. Simrall an ex\npense fund of .$2000 if the en\ncampment was located at Hat\ntiesburg, but the offer was not\naccepted as the facilities for\nholding the encampment at Gulf\nport were better.\nCllis-Meeks.\nThe home of Mr. and Mrs. Joe\nJ.

He was called at my\nrequest by Miss Minnie Sanders-,\nand after,\' remaining in my room\nonly a few minutes, he went to\nsee my husband over at. the Clop\nton Hotel, telling me at the time\nthat he had been called to see\nhim. Afterward he returned to\nmy room and was in the act of\nexamining my circulation, as in\ndicated by my heart\'d action,\nwhen John entered the room.\nWhen John entered he said: "1\nhave caught you this time, Dr.\nWendel," and Dr. Wendel said.\n"That\'s so."

The main features are\nnothing more nor less than gambling games, and\nanything but elevating. A large per cent, of\nt\'leir audience are negroes who spend their last\ncent, to patronize them if they have to beg or\nsteal their next meal. A community is always\nimpoverished by their visits. The company that\nwas here the past week, so far as we know was\nfar above the average street fair.\nSHOULD MAINTAIN A MOBILE ARMY.\nExtracts from remarks made by Captain E. G.\nPeyton, Adjutant, 17th Infantry to the National Guard\nof Wyoming during his recent tour of inspection.\n"There are numerous arguments to be made in\nsupport of the proposition of our military men that\nthe United States should maintain at all times a\nmobile army of proper proportions, capable of re\nsponding immediately to any military emergency that\nmight arise. To my mind the strongest argument in\nfavor of this proposition is the benefit such a force\nwould be to the National Guard, in that a mobile\narmy would be able to take the field promptly in\ncase of war, meet the enemy\'s first advance, and\nhold him in check, thereby giving the National Guard\ntime to complete its organization and mobilization,\nand to prepare for itself more thoroughly for work\non the field of battle. It will take time to fill your\ncompanies up to war strength and to instruct your\nnew recruits. You should be given time to accustom\nyourselves to wearing government snoes, carrying\nthe Infantryman\'s pack, handling and preparing the\ngovernment ration, and under no circumstances\nshould infantry take the field until it has acquired\nthat discipline which will result in a steadfast for\nward movement against the enemy even after fifty\nper cent, or more of its numbers have fallen.\nIn the interest of economy that mobile army in\ntime of peace should consist largely of that arm of\nservice which is least expensive to maintain and at\nthe same time most important in war: Infantry.\nIn this connection the remarks of Field Marshal\nEarl Roberts of the British Army are apropos, viz:\n"A terrrible lesson awaits the nation opposed to\nequally brave but better trained opponents on the\nfield of battle. No amount of money, no National\nsacrifice can then avail for modern war moves fast\nand time lost in peace can never be made\' up during\nthe stress of the campaign."\nThey believe it means tha doubling of our popula\ntion within five years- It means a new impetus in\nthe business world. It means that we will be con\nfionted with many new and interesting problems.\nChief among them is the question of proper enter\ntainment of the masses. If we cannot\ndevise some novel method of entertainme.it\nit behooves us to imitate other successful\ncities. How about city parks centrally located\nwhich are not on the outskirts of the city? True\nwe have a nice park tovisit, but wha about the cost\nof reaching it? The walk is too long to take in the\nbroiling sun and all the pleasure and recreation\nwould be overcome by the fatigue of the trip. It\nis for the class who cannot afford to pay car fares\nfor their families that we are pleading! They are\nthe ones to be benefitted by public parks. The\ncity is expanding and unless someimmediate action\nis taken by our City Fathers to secure the few\nfew still available plots, they may find it rather\nexpensive to do later on when they will be forced\nto it by public demand. Put in the swings and\n1 1 t A J ? 1- J\nscups ana otner lorms or entertainment, anu\namusement for the little ones! They like it and\nappreciate it and it is\nErect a band stand and\ngive daily promenade concerts. It makes people\nhappy and lifts their burdens. They need diver\nsion.

Knapp never gave better ad\nvice to Southern farmers than in the aphorism:\n"Use less fire and more sense in dealing with your\nfields in springtime."\nIn view of the fact that the very greatest need\nof our Southern soils is humus, and the most cost\nly of all fertilizing elements elements is nitrogen,\nit is positively sickening to see farmer after farm\ner burning the trash, corn stalkr, etc.. which\nwould supply this humus and nitrogen. Nature is\nseeking to restore soil fertility by putting back\nthis rotting vegetable matter; foolish man defeats\nher efforts.\nIt is gratifying to see the general awakening\non the part of the press to the seriousness of this\nmatter, and the Oklahoma Farm Journal puts the\nmatter none too strongly when it says in its last\nissue :\n"Any man anywhere in Oklahoma who burns\ncornstalks and weeds and grass instead of plowing\nthem under deserves to fail and to get short re\nturns for his labor. No sympathy is coming to\nhim. He is robbing the soil, which is the state\'s\nchief resource. He is not a good citizen." South\nern Farm Gazette.\nPRAYER RATHER THAN ABUSE.\nOut in California in some way it has turned\nout that a minister undertook to run a daily news-\nnaner for one dav only. He was Rev. Malcom\n1 -\nJames MacLeod, evidently a bold Scotchman and\ndevoted Presbyterian. It appears that he expect\ned it to be an easy thing for a man of trained intelli\ntrence and svstematic industry. But at the end of\nhis strenuous day he wrote this conclusion:\n"My time is now almost up as I pen this last\nline: mv hand is almost paralyzed: my brain is be\nfuddled, and I am free to confess that I am right\nglad to vacate the holy spot. Such rush and rio\nand disarrav. Such a jumble and potpourri. It\nstrikes me as the daily elfort to bring order out o\nchaos, and to do it lightingly quick. I am remind\ned of the memorable words. The earth was with\nout form and void, and darkness was upon the\nface of the deep.- And the spirit moved upon the\nface of the waters. Never shall I criticise news\npaper men more. I shall pray for them. They\nwill have mv heart\'s forebearance henceforth and\nforever, the hardest worked, shortest lived, poor\nest paid brain workers on this weary old world of\nours.\nThere is much force in the honest minister\'s\nremarks. The public is all too ignorant of the un\navoidable difficulties surrounding the making of a\ndaily newspaper. The best trained, most con\nscientious and industrious newspaper men must\nmake mistakes frequently. The wonder is that\nthey do so well on an average. The public should\nnot sneer at them, or call them liars. The minis\ntsr\'s attitude of prayer is more sympathetic and\nwould prove more effective.
