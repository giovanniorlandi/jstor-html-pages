It\nseems to me its, time for some one to\nsay that it wasn\'t this association or\nthat which won the war it was the\nloyalty of all the straightforward\nAmerican citizens which brought\nsuccess to the allied cause.\n"It is to be presumed that those\nwho read, the extract from. General\nPershing\'s speech at the Lafayette\nMarne day banquet concluded that\nin my address, which preceded, I had\nmade the claim that labor won the\nwar.\nMade No Such Claim\n"Of course I made no such claim\nand, much as I regret the necessity\nfor saying so, there was no ground\nfor the rather testy remarks of the\nleader whom we all admire and to\nwhom we all owe a great debt.\n"With everything else contained\nin General Pershing\'s speech found\nmyself in full accord. I regret ex\nceedingly that he should have made\nit necessary for me to make this\nstatement. I have been proud of the\nrecord of labor during the vai It\nwas a magnificent record, unsur\npassed hy labor anywhere, unequalled\nby labor in any other country. I am\nproud that this record should have\nbeen made by American labor. That\nI repeat and shall repeat whenever\nit seems opportune or necessary.\n"I did not say that labor won th?\nwar. I offered no reason and no ex\ncuse in my remarks for what General\nPershing had to say. I regret, as\nperhaps he himself does, his lack of\ntact, his impropriety. General Per\nshing is a brave and splendid soldier\nand I pay him the tribute of saying\nthat his generalship on the battle\nfield is much better than his general\nship as an after dinner speaker.\nBomb Under Engine\nKills Engineer On\nA.

Everybody\nnow agrees that concessions are ne\ncessary( but not everybody fully ap\npreciates the significance of con cessions.\n"The Soviet erovernmpnt sfnures\nnavt or students, starting in the advantage in the form of the Hp.\nvelopment of productive forces and\nan increase in the quantity of pro\nducts available immediately or with\nin a short period.

It increases the quanti\nthe advanced against the backward\nmachine production against hand\nproduction.

Then, while guitar or banjo\nor accordeon wailed and plunked a\ndancing strain in a weird minor key,\nthe husky platform workers, hands\non hips, have shuffled soufflingly ov\ner the circular piles of shrimps.

During\nthe season of 1920, 20,716 persons\nwere supported by the industry, more\nthan one million dollars were invest\ned in shrimp fleets, and the catch\nwas listed by government officials at\n28,950,000 pounds.\nStone Crab is Too\nMuch for Concrete\nIf it\'s from the News\' Job Rooms\nit\'s good printing.\nVELVET\n"The World\'s Best Flour"\n(By AnmHlatrd I\'re.)\nSt. Petersburg, Fla., Sept. 7\nConcrete heretofore has been regar\nded as a match for everything but\nsteel tools and high explosives but it\nhas been discovered that the stone\ncrab, common to Florida waters,\ndigs into and crushes it as so much\nchalk.
