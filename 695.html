Harrow and reharrow until\na perfect seed bed is secured. An\nounce of preparation is worth a pound\nof cultivation. Apply lime to the corn\nland as tho seed bed is prepared,\nj Where grass lands have not had a\nsufficient amount of stable manure ap\nplied previously there should now be\nan application of commercial fertil\nizers. As the grass becomes green is\nthe proper time to make the applica\ntion.\nGo over your drainage systems and\nsee that they are working properly.\nOften earth from the sides is thrown\ninto the bottom of open ditches by the\nfreezing and thawing of winter. This\nmay so choke up the ditch as to inter- - f\nfere with the outflow of water or the\nearth slide may cause the flow to cut\ninto and undermine the opposite bank.\nWhere there is under drainage, see\nthat the outlets are open. Examine\nthe fields of winter wheat, rye and\nother winter grains and see if the\ncrop has been killed, injured in spots\nby "heaving” or "spewing" or has\nbeen drowned out by water standing\non the surface during the winter. If\nany such spots are found plan to give\nthem better drainage.\nMend Your Fences.\nThe time will soon come for turning\nstock on pasture. Trouble may bo\nsaved if the fences are gone over at\nthis tit.e and loose wires tightened\nup and defective posts or rails re\nplaced.\nI Continue hauling manure on the\n• fields Intended for corn. Fresh manure\nspread on the top of plowed land and\nworked In with the harrow will give\nbetter results than if spread before\nplowing at this season unless the\nmanure be very coarse.\nThe too common practice of burn\ning over old fields at this season pre\nparatory to plowing is strongiy to be\nreprobated. It is much better prac\ntice to go over such fields with the\ndisk harrow once or twice to chop up\nthe dry vegetable matter and mix it\nwith the soil and then plow, rather\nthan to burn the vegetable matter,\nwhich is the life of the soil.—From\nMaryland Agricultural College Bulle\ntin, “Elementary Vocational Agricul\nture for Maryland Schools.”\nDISCING LAND BEFORE PLOWING\nDESIRABLE.\nNICHOLAS SCHMITZ,\nMaryland Agricultural College\nExtension Service.\nDiscing a sod before plowing makes\nthe plowing easier and greatly facili\ntates the preparation of a good seed\nbed. It is as important to have the\nbottom of the seedbed finely pulver\nized as it is to have the surface well\nworked.\nThe easiest way to do this is to disc\nbefore plowing. It may seem that this\nis an extra operation, but land that is\nwell disced before plowing will not\nneed as much working after plowing\nIn order to get it in first class condi\ntion, and there is no question of the\nbottom of the seedbed being as well\nworked as the surface.\nIt is also a good plan to disc rve\nor rye and clover before plowing un\nder. This aids the complete turning\nunder and at the same time helps to\nmix it with the soil, which is necessary\nin order to get the most rapid decom\nposition. It also insures against the\ndifficulty of preventing the clover from\nbeing turned under in a mat, In which\ncase it simply acts as a blanket in\npreventing the upward movement of\nmoisture.\nCANADA FIELD PEAS SHOULD BE\nSOWN EARLY.\nCanada field peas are especially\nwell adapted to the climate of Canada\nand the northern tier of states where\nthere is sufficient moisture. In Mary\nland they will succeed much better in\nj the northern and mountainous sections\nI of the State than elsewhere.\n! Like the garden pea, they will not\nj make much growth after hot, muggy\nweather sets in, along about harvest\n! time or a little before, and for that\nreason should not be considered in\nj the light of a grain crop with a mix\nture of oats as they are in the north\nern states and Canada.\nWhere oats is sown in the spring for\nsoiling or for hay the feeding value\nmay be greatly increased by mixing\nCanada field peas with the oats. The\nquantity of seed per acre varies from\n1 % bushels of oats and 1V& bushels\nof peas to 2 bushels of each. It Is very\ni Important that the crop should be\nj sown in early spring, for the earlier\nj the crop is planted the greater will\n! be the likelihood of the maximum re\nI turns, as both oats and peas suffer in\n1 the hot days of late spring and early\n| summer. Although some growers\n. recommend that the peas be planted\nj much deeper than the oats and a few\n; days before planting the oats, there is,\nhowever, no good reason for this prac\n| tice, as experiments have shown that\neven distribution and as large yields\ncan be secured when the oats and peas\nare mixed together with the grain drill\nand seeded together.\nWhere land has never grown garden\nor field peas it is usually advisable to\notherwise the growth will\nnot be Sufficient to pay for the seed\nand the extra labor\nCASTOR IA\nFor Infants ana Children.\nThe Kind You Have Always Bought\nOcutora of\nINCREASED liAY YULI\nFROM TO?

The proper amount\nto apply depends of course upon the\nfertility of the soil, but ordinarily\nnitrate of soda should be applied at\nthe rate of from 150 to 250 pounds\nper acre, and if a combination of acid\nrock and nitrate of soda is used, equal\nparts, the mixture should be applied [\nat the rate of 200 to 450 pounds per\nacre. Such an application under \'\nordinary conditions may be expected\nto give an increase in yield of from\n1 to 1% tons per acre.\nThe time of applying the fertilizer Is\nvery important It should be applied I\nas soon as the gra begins to green,\nwhich Is usually the latter p: of j\nMarch or the first of April. Tim early !\napplication of tho fertilizer is abso- ;\nlutely necessary for maximum returns,\nfor the fertilizer can not be mad use\nof by the plant until it bus been dis- j\nsolved and carried down into the soil.\nThe early application makes use of i\nthe early rains.\nMany farmers have bee\'\' disap\npointed when using nitrate of soda ,\nbecause they havo applied it too late •\nor at a time when there was not sufii j\ncient moisture to dissolve It, ho that I\nthe timothy would get full use of j\nwhat w r as applied before maturing.\nWHY NOT TRUE PREPAREDNESS j\nIN RURAL EDUCATION?\n"Preparedness” is the present cry. j\nWell, genuine education is true prep \\\naration. Teach our souths how to be- j\ncome efficient and iwbnomical in their j\nlife work and the problem is readily\nsolved.\nMake the Corn Clubs, the Home\nmaking Clubs, the Poultry\' competi\ntions, the Cooking and Sawing con\ntests and all such activities a part oi\nthe school system. Let the work on\nthe farm and in the home become a\npart of the school study. Let (he rural\nschool not only teach farm accounting,\nbut have the pupils keep the accounts\nof their farms and homes.\nSeed testing, soil examination,\nstock judging and selecting, garden\nplanting, and working, household man\nagement and routine, canning fruit and\nvegetables, milk management, egg\ntesting, incubating, brooding, bal\nancing rations and feeding the rations,\nrecording progress, anti studying re\nsults, learnmg to reason on homely\nsubjects and to solve personal prob\nlems, learning to think and to work\nefficiently—these are some of the\nitems of real rural education—is this\nnarrow educating? No! It is as\nbroad as the life and the work of the\nworld. Are we leaving out. culture?\nNo! The highest and 1,; .-; culture\ncomes through studying intelligently\nthe country, the life about us, nature,\nhuman nature, and tne work of the\nworld—this we cannot do without\nknowing something of the thoughts of\ndur poets, our philosophers, our his\ntorians, and our writers as well as our\nscientists and our teachers of practical\nthings.

P%r instance,\ncarloads of selected animals have been\nr hipped from Wisconsin to many mid\ndle states, the Pacific Coast and even\nto Japan and Mexico as a result of\nsuch organization in that state.\nThe method of organization is for a\nleader in the community to call a\nmeeting and get as many interested\nbreeders as can be secured, this meet\ning to be addressed by a capable\nspeaker on the value of such organ\nization.

BECKENSTRATER,\nMaryland Agricultural College.\nMost of the grains make very ob\njectionable companion crops in the\norchard; in fact, many an orchard has\nbeen ruined by their use. While such\ncrops, wheat, oats and the like, occupy\nthe land, it can not be cultivated.\nThey grow at a time when the tree*\nneed cultivation most and these crops\nat the same time consume large\nquantities of plant food and moisture,\nand have a strong tendency to make\nthe land poor. There is no good rea\nson why the above grains should ever\nbe grown as a companion crop In the\norchard.\nBecause of its great economic value\nand the many uses to which it can be\nput the orchardist is frequently\ntempted to plant corn in the orchard.\nCorn has not all the objectionable fea\nt ires that the other grains, have. It re\nquires cultivation, is planted later in\nthe season and by the time it gets under\nway, the trees have completed a good\nshare of their growth. If corn is used\nit should be kept a good distance away\nfrom the trees,, the rows should be run\nnorth and south and it should be\nplanted as late in the season as pos\nsible.\nHay should never be grown in a\nyoung orchard. It competes with the\ntrees at every step. It robs them of\nmoisture and plant food when the\n\' Tecs need them most. It provides\nexcellent means for harboring insects\nand other pests. If hay must be\ngrown, on the land occupied by the\norchard, as some persist in doing, by\nall means cut down the trees and get\nthem out of the way.\nSPRING VETCH NOT SUCCESSFUL\nIN MARYLAND.\nOwing to the high price of hairy\nvetch, many farmers are wondering if\nthey can substitute spring vetch,\nthinking that this can be sown in the\nspring, as its name would imply:\nSpring vetch is not suited to this\nSiate. It is an absolute failure.\nNone of the vetches grow well after\nour hot. muggy weather sets in in late\npring and early summer. Spring\nvetch will not make enough growth to\namount to much before the hot, mug\ngy weather sets In. hence there is sel\ndom enough growth made to pay for\nseeding it.\nSpring vetch Is also sometime?\ncalled common vetch and sown in the\nfall, but it is not as successful as hairy\nvetch when sown In the fall, and, in\nfact, is practically as much of a failure\nw hen sown at that time as when sown\nin the spring.

L Mitchell.\nThe pla* will only take ten years\nto rid.the County of the debt incur\nred af er build ng the west county\nroad ami the road from Hugt esville\nto Bene Hot as proposed at the first\nmeeting.\nWe believe that the people of the\nComity agree with us that we should\ntak * advantage of he Stale Aid law\na* far as prssibie and build gra htaliy\nami at ti e same time have roads that\nwill be of la-ling go d am benefit\nt > our people.\nWe understand that there is every\nlikelihood that the bill introduced in\nthe House of Delegates ny Hon\nOliver Metzerott will pass both\nhouses providing that hereafter the\nState shad maintain all roads built\nunder the state aid law. If th\'s\nproves true there is every reason\nwhy we shoul l go slow in building\nour roads, to get the advantage of\nthe State aid law thus obtaining the\nbenefit of permanent and lasting\nroads and at the satre time relieving\nthe County of the large cost of main\ntaining them. Aside from this, as\nwe have said before, we believe that\nwhe < thf. present links are complet\ned, the state will not cease, hut con\ntinue the road building scheme until\npractically every important road in\nthe Counties is connected up with\nthe main state roads. We believe,\nthe Sta*e has gone too far in the\nbtti’ding >t roads to slop after the\ncompletion of the present contem\nplated roads. The first tne ding and\nthe last tnote thoroughly demonstrat\ned the sentiment of the people along\nthe due of road building than the\nsecond when practically pandemonium\nreigned at the lime the resolution\npasse I at that meeting was adopted.\nNo man can honestly sa/ that the\ntrue sentiment of those present at\nthat meeting was expressed in the\nresolutions, especially in view of ihe\nfan that it was later evidenced that\nmany present at the time of the pas\nrage of Haii resolution did not know\nwhat had been done. We, therefore*\nurge our representatives at Annapo\nlis to go slow and fo\'low what is\nreally the sentiment of the tax-pay\ners of t\'*D County and pass a meas\nure such as suggested by Delegate\nMitchell at the first meeting to meet\nthe requirements cf the Stale Aid\nlaw. \\V e should meet the provisions\nof that law and go no further at this\ntime. The tax-payers are willing to\nbear a smaller increased tax to build\nthe roads gradually under the State\nAid law where lasting and perma\nnent results will be had, out are op\nposed to a large increase in \'axation\nto meet the obligation of the piopos\ned bold -d indebtedness of |>140,000\nto build roads that will leave a debt\nof nearly #200,000 on our County for\ngenera\'ions to come, without any\nlasting benefi- either to the present\nor next genet ation.\nBrown;—Thomas Hr -wn, father of\nAnnie A , Willie.

The two latest additions are\nDabtda, a language of British East\nAfrica, and I.lmba. the language of a\ntribe lu the hiuterland of Siena Leone\nParts of the New Testament have\nactually been translated into pidgin\nEnglish, that strange lingo, hulf baby\ntalk and half slang, which Is the chief\nmeans of communication through all\nthe east.\nThe difficulties presented In translat\ning the New Testament Into this bar\nbnrous hotch-potch must have bees\ntremendous, but they have been sur\nmounted.\nAnetiMr language of tlie same sort\nIs Chinook. This consists of about\ntwo-flftbs Chinook, two-flfths red In\ndian tongues aud the rest English and\nCauadinn French. It Is the tongue of\nbarter on the Pacific coast of Alaska\nand the Dominion. At least 50,000 In\ndlana speak it, and lately St. John’s\ngospel has been issued In this jargon\nfor their sieclal benefit\nThere is also a version of the Scrip\ntures translated into the primitive lan\nguage of the head hunters of Borneo.\nIt was made by German raissiona\nrles, printed In South Africa, paid for\nwith British money and circulated In\nPapua.—London Answers.\nDifference In Woods.\nTimber Is classed as hard or soft\nand the main point of difference be\ntween the trees that produce these\nclasses is that the soft wooded tree\nhas “needle leaves," slim, narrow and\nalmost uniform in breadth, while the\nhard wood trees have broad leaves\nof various shapes. Again, some soft\nwood trees carry cones, such trees be\ning termed conifers. Uesin, too. Is\nmore characteristic of soft than of\nhard wood. To the class of soft woods\nbelong the pines, spruces and firs, and\nthe most common examples of these\nare yellow pine, while fir. pitch pine\nand spruce or red fir. In the common\ner hard woods are oak, beech, mahog\nany, ash, walnut, plane, elm. birch and\nebony.\nHe Proved It.\n"My dear child," said the fond moth\ner, “If you marry Henry, do you think\nhe will have the force to lift himself\nabove his fellow men to a level with\nyou?”\n"Why. of course 1 do, mamma.
