It\nwas a striking parade and some\nthing rather marvelous to me that\nall these men. largely over half of\nwhom had voted against him, still\ndesired to hear him above all other\nmen. The fact is he is trusted by\nthe working men the country over.\nThey may have differed with him.\nbut they lelieve in him.

The issue of\nTanama Unds and of three per\ncent one year currency certificates\nlias not proved a aire for the panic\nevil that is upon us. The only\nhope for its jopu!arity rested upon\nthe jKissihility of that measure ter\nminating the panic. Had the\nbanks all resumed iiavmcnt of de\nbitors and their usual course of\nbusiness, had the clouds of doubt\nand business depression been lifted.\nI believe Mr. Roosevelt\'s popular\nity would have incrcascd.and he\nand his secretary of the treasury\nbeen acclaimed saviors of the coun\ntry\'s prostK-rity, but seemingly to\nme their effort was and is a failure\nand the status of affairs now is that\nthe Federal treasury has heretofore\ngone to the assistance of the banks\nby the dejxsit within the bank cof\nfers of over $40,000,000 of cool\ncash, which lickings to the cople\nand which the banks are crinittcd\nto hold and use without interest,\nand in addition to that they have\nissued millions of Umds and cur\nrency certficates in a time of pro\nfound K-ace and unUumded physi\ncal prosperity of the country,\nthereby increasing the national\ndebt, these Umds being knight\nchiefly by the government without\ninterest. Their issue was not\nneeded to preserve our currency, it\nwas not needed to pay our debt,\nit was not needed to retain gold in\nthe country, and even the adminis\ntration evidently Ucame so satis\nfied of its inefficiency to restore\nconfidence that thev withdrew the\nUmds and \'certificates from the\nmarket before the, greater part of\nthem were sold.
