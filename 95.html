College.\nWinter Planted Fruit Trees\nGive Best Results\nAccording to reports\nin to the Mississippi A.\nSuccessful storage of sweet\npotatoes requires conditions some\nwhat different from those neces\nsary for the storage of other\nroot crops. The potato needs to\nbe mature and free from dirt,\nbruises and breaks in the skin. .\nDie the crop when the soil is\ndry and allow the potatoes to re\nmain on the ground in the sun\nfor a few hours, but never leave\nthem but during the night. Pick\nup in baskets\',, and haul to fhe\nnlaceof storage without remov\ning from these baskets. Do riot\nuse sacks for containers as they\nallow many of the potatoes to be\nbroken and bruised. At . the\nplace of storage sort the potatoes\nand grade by removing the very\nsmall ones\' and all that are bro\nken or cut.\nwhen larire Quantities are to\nbe stored a specially constructed\nstore house is well worth the ex\npense. Almost any outbuilding,\nhowever, can be used successful\nlv Nail Rtrios over the cracks\nso as to make the building fairly\ntight. Near the center of the\nroom put in a small stove that\nwill hold fire well, to heat tne\nroom.\nFor a room of ordinary size,\ntwo or three doors, iu Dy io\ninches, near the top and the\nsame number at the bottom oi\nthe room will provide the proper\nventilation. These should De\nfiv oa thot thev will oDen and\nllAVVi Wcw f-iv \' \'\nclose easily and tightly.\nSome use bushel crates made\nof slats to hold the potatoes and\nstack them one on top of the\nother. Others prefer to make\nsmall slatted bins. The object\nis to secure a thorough circula\ntion nf air through the potatoes.\nThe bins should be made so that\nthey will be three or four inches\nfrom the floor and the same dis\ntance from the walls of the\nbuilding. Two by fours nailed\nto the floor and walls will give\ngood ventilating space. The\ncoming siats are easily nailed to them,\nand M. leaving about an inch space be:\nis now twppn each.
