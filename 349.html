        <pre>['“The prospect of local elections in 1990 threatens the [Communist] party’s control over rep\xad\nresentative institutions and, possibly, augurs the emergence of nationalist local governments \nthroughout the non-Russian territories. . . . The political appeal of nationalism has helped \ncreateforces that challenge the party’s monopoly over the authoritative decision-making process \nin the Soviet Union. ”\nThe Soviet Union’s Nationalities Question\nB y  St e v e n  L . B u rg\nAssociate Professor of Political Science, Brandeis University\nI\nn a nationally televised message to the country \nbroadcast as part of the regular evening news \non July 1, 1989, Mikhail Gorbachev, President \nof the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the \nCommunist party, warned the Soviet people that \nrising levels of ethnic conflict had put his program of \nreforms and “the destiny and integrity of our state” \nin jeopardy. He cautioned that “if we do not recog\xad\nnize the enormous danger of such phenomena, if \nthey spread, we can expect worse times.” Gor\xad\nbachev promised increased government sensitivity \nand responsiveness “to all legitimate ethnic \ndemands and aspirations,” but he warned that he \nwould take “the most decisive measures” against \ncontinued unrest. Yet Gorbachev offered neither a \ndefinition of what constituted “legitimate” demands, \nnor a specific program for dealing with the political, \neconomic, cultural, ecological and other demands \nalready raised by organized groups, elected \nrepresentatives, activists and demonstrators among \nthe nationalities.1\nThe speech reflected Gorbachev’s political quan\xad\ndary. The economic reforms he has introduced \nhave significantly increased social and economic \nhardships without thus far producing many mater\xad\nial benefits, and this fact has increased the level of \ndissatisfaction among the Soviet people. At the \nsame time, Gorbachev’s political reforms have \ncreated ideal conditions for the mobilization of eth\xad\nnic identity by activists intent on redressing long- \nheld grievances against Moscow, or against their \nethnic neighbors.\nThe campaign for perestroika, or restructuring, \nhas placed all aspects of the Soviet economic and \npolitical system on the table for debate. The cam\xad\npaign for glasnost, or openness, has permitted the \nemergence of free-wheeling discussion, dialogue \nand polemics in the open media. Almost no topic is \nconsidered “taboo.” In addition, changes in the elec\xad\n1Pravda, July 2, 1989.\n2Lubomyr Hajda, “The Nationalities Problem in the Soviet \nUnion,” Current History (October, 1988), pp. 325-328, 347, 352.\n3Pravda, July 5, 1988.\ntoral system and the composition and competencies \nof central representative institutions have increased \naccess to participation in the authoritative policy\xad\nmaking process. Under these conditions, activists \namong the nationalities have publicly addressed \nemotional ethnic grievances, linking them to \nbroader political and economic demands and gen\xad\nerating widespread popular support. As a result, \neach milestone in the process of reform has been \nmarked by the escalation of activity that under\xad\nmines the coherence of the Soviet system and \nMoscow’s control over it.\nThe nineteenth party conference, convened by \nGorbachev in June, 1988, to push further reforms, \nfollowed 18 months of sometimes violent ethnic un\xad\nrest. It took place against the background of on\xad\ngoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan \nover the status of Nagorno-Karabakh (the ethnical\xad\nly Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan), growing \nnational assertiveness in the Baltic republics (where \nindependent and strongly nationalist popular polit\xad\nical movements were already forming) and mount\xad\ning evidence of unrest elsewhere.2 Yet despite this \nbrewing crisis, the conference adopted a resolution \non relations among the nationalities that consisted \nonly of vague calls for devolution of greater \nautonomy to the republics, improved policy coordi\xad\nnation between regional and central institutions, \nclarification of the economic relations between each \nrepublic and the overall economy, the creation of an \nunspecified central government organ to deal with \nnationality issues and the adoption of whatever con\xad\nstitutional changes might be required.3\nThe resolution reflected the continuing belief of \nGorbachev and the party leadership that nationality \nproblems could be “solved” through “objective” re\xad\nsearch and analysis. It called for renewed efforts to \ninstill patriotism and “internationalism” through \nschooling, propaganda, military service and other \ninstruments of socialization. It contained no recog\xad\nnition, however, of the concrete political and eco\xad\nnomic conflicts around which ethnic identities were \nbecoming mobilized, or of the need to regulate such\n341\n', '342 •  CURRENT HISTORY, OCTOBER, 1989\nconflicts through interethnic negotiations and \nsubstantive concessions, or of the likely effect these \nwould have on the “rules of the game” in Soviet \npolitics.\nThe conference resolution reiterated Gorbachev’s \nFebruary, 1988, call for the convening of a Central \nCommittee plenum devoted to the nationalities \nquestion. But in July, at a plenum devoted to im\xad\nplementation of the decisions of the conference, \nGorbachev announced that the nationalities \nplenum would be delayed until mid-1989. In short, \nthe party leadership was still unprepared to con\xad\nfront the true dimensions of the nationalities prob\xad\nlem.\nGorbachev and his allies in the leadership ap\xad\nparently believed that they could co-opt the emerg\xad\ning nationalist movements in the Baltic republics, \nand perhaps elsewhere, as well. In june, 1988, they \npermitted the establishment in Estonia of the first \nofficially sanctioned independent mass political or\xad\nganization in the country, the “People’s Front”; they \nappointed Vaino Valas, a new, more flexible \nrepublic party leader with personal connections to \nGorbachev, and they tolerated the renewed public \nuse of symbols of independent statehood, like the \npre-Communist Estonian national flag.\nIn Lithuania, the rise of independent popular \npolitical organizations was at first opposed by the \nlocal party leadership. But the appointment of Al- \ngirdas Brazauskas as party leader in October, 1988, \nushered in a period of official tolerance for the \n“Movement for Restructuring,” known as Sajudis \n(Movement), including an attempt by the party \nleadership to undercut popular support for the \nmovement by adopting more moderate versions of \nthe positions advanced by Sajudis. In Latvia, too, a \nnew republic party leader, Janis Vargis, was ap\xad\npointed to grant symbolic concessions to local na\xad\ntional pride and real concessions to local concerns \nabout the survival of the Latvian language. In addi\xad\ntion, Vargis was to conduct relations with a newly \nestablished mass organization, the Latvian “Pop\xad\nular Front.”\nThese conciliatory responses failed to blunt the \npolitical demands of the independent national \nmovements. Each of the three popular front organ\xad\nizations advanced increasingly radical demands for \nregional cultural, economic and political autono\xad\nmy. Nationalist sentiments grew so strong and so \nquickly that in November, 1988, the Estonian \nlegislature declared Estonia a sovereign state and \nasserted its right to veto central legislation adopted \nin Moscow. In February, 1989, Sajudis publicly \ndeclared as its goal the establishment of “an in\xad\ni Chislennost i sostav naseleniya S.S.S.R. po dannym Vsesoyuznoi\nperepisi naseleniya 1979 goda (Number and structure of the\nU .S .S .R . population in the 1979 All-Union population\ncensus), (Moscow: Finansy i statistika, 1984), pp. 7, 71, 102.\ndependent and neutral Lithuanian state in a demili\xad\ntarized zone.” The growth of popular support for \nthe Baltic independence movements during the \nsummer and fall of 1988, made clear by the pro\xad\nliferation of their local branches, the growth of their \nmembership and their ability to organize large- \nscale public demonstrations, inspired activists \n— and frightened the party leadership — in other \nrepublics.\nDISSIDENCE IN THE UKRAINE\nIn the Ukraine, informal groups attempted to \nestablish a Ukrainian popular front organization in \nthe summer of 1988, but they were suppressed by \nthe authorities. Given the relative size and econom\xad\nic importance of the Ukraine and the potential \ndepth of popular grievances against the Soviet \nsystem, allowing any nationalist group to organize \nin the Ukraine may have been seen as too danger\xad\nous. According to the 1979 Soviet census, the \nUkrainian republic contains 49.8 million people \n(about 19 percent of the Soviet population). About \n36.5 million people (or 73.6 percent of the Ukraine’s \npopulation) declared Ukrainian nationality. \nAnother 5.9 million Ukrainians live outside the \nrepublic. Together, ethnic Ukrainians are the \nsecond largest national group in the Soviet Union, \naccounting for about 16 percent of the Soviet \npopulation.\nThe Baltic republics are far smaller by com\xad\nparison. Estonia is populated by 1.5 million people \n(somewhat more than 0.5 percent of the Soviet pop\xad\nulation), Latvia by 2.5 million (almost 1 percent) \nand Lithuania by 3.4 million (1.3 percent).i *4 The \nUkrainian share of the Soviet economy is cor\xad\nrespondingly greater than that of the Baltic repub\xad\nlics, as well. The risks associated with any na\xad\ntionalist unrest in the Ukraine are therefore greater \nthan those associated with unrest in the Baltic \nregion.\nUkrainians may also be able to claim more pain\xad\nful grievances against the Soviet system than any \nother nationality. The Ukraine suffered enormous \nhuman and material destruction as the result of the \nStalinist collectivization of agriculture, the Nazi \nGerman invasion during World War II and the \nreimposition of Soviet rule. Soviet policies have also \nrestricted the development of the Ukrainian \nlanguage and culture. Appeals to these past in\xad\njustices represent a potentially powerful basis for \nthe mobilization of mass support and a powerful \nthreat to Moscow’s continued control over the re\xad\npublic. Not surprisingly, therefore, a nationalist \ndissident movement in the Ukraine in the 1960’s \nwas brutally suppressed by Moscow, and Pyotr \nShelest, a republic party leader suspected of sym\xad\npathy for the nationalist cause, was removed from \npower. His successor, Vladimir Shcherbitsky, re-\n', 'The Soviet Union’s Nationalities Question •  343\nReprinted by permission from Soviet Society Today, by Michael Rywkin (Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 1989).\nTHE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS\nmains the party’s leader and a vigorous opponent of \nnationalism in the Ukraine today.\nBy the end of 1988, however, the effort to estab\xad\nlish a national movement in the Ukraine had been \ntaken up by members of the official Writers’ Union. \nDespite opposition from the republic party leader\xad\nship, the Writers’ Union formally called for the es\xad\ntablishment of a “Ukrainian Popular Movement in \nSupport of Restructuring” and began to gather sup\xad\nport from other official groups, informal groups, \nprominent cultural figures and even dissidents. In \nJanuary, 1989, the draft program for a “People’s \nMovement for Restructuring in the Ukraine” was \ncompleted. It called for political democratization, \ngreater economic autonomy for the republic and of\xad\nficial support for the survival of the Ukrainian \nlanguage and culture, including the establishment \nof Ukrainian as the official state language of the \nrepublic. Despite efforts to accommodate the party, \nthe program and those who prepared it were at\xad\ntacked in the party-controlled media.5\nAlthough they have been unable to establish a \nmass political movement, Ukrainian cultural\n5Bohdan Nahaylo, “Confrontation over Creation of Ukrai\xad\nnian Popular F ront,” Report on the U.S.S.R., vol. l,n o .9 (M arch  \n3, 1989), pp. 13-20.\n6Bohdan Nahaylo, “Inaugural Conference on Ukrainian \nLanguage Society Turns into Major Political Demonstration,” \nibid., pp. 20-22.\nfigures have established an organization to advance \nthe Ukrainian language and culture. The Taras \nShevchenko Ukrainian Language Society, founded \nin February, 1989, immediately became a vehicle \nfor the expression of nationalist sentiments and has \ncreated additional pressure on the Ukrainian party \nleadership to drop its resistance.6\nIn late 1988 and early 1989 independent popular \npolitical organizations were also established in the \nCentral Asian republics of Turkmenistan and Uz\xad\nbekistan. The Uzbek group organized a series of \nlarge demonstrations in Tashkent in March, April \nand May, 1989. In early June, ethnic tensions in \nUzbekistan produced rioting and violence in which \nat least 100 people were killed, hundreds more were \ninjured and widespread destruction of property \ntook place. The Uzbek rioters were finally quelled \nby calling in at least 12,000 soldiers. Rioting on a \nsmaller scale broke out in Kazakhstan later the \nsame month.\nPopular political organizations also emerged in \nBelorussia and Moldavia during this period. In the \nCaucasus, the Armenian national movement that \nled the demonstrations over the Nagorno-Kara\xad\nbakh issue continued its activity, and by June, \n1989, a Georgian national movement had coal\xad\nesced, spurred on by the tragic outcome of earlier \ndemonstrations.\nIn early April, 1989, a wave of strikes and dem\xad\n', '344 •  CURRENT HISTORY, OCTOBER, 1989\nonstrations swept over Georgia, initiated by ac\xad\ntivists seeking greater autonomy for the republic \nand spurred on by fears that the Abkhazian Auton\xad\nomous Republic, a part of the Georgian republic, \nwould be granted separate status in response to \ndemands from the ethnic Abkhazians living there, \nwho constitute only 17.1 percent of the population \n(Georgians constitute 43.9 percent, the remainder \nconsist mostly of Russians and Armenians).7 On \nApril 7, troops were called into Tbilisi to control the \ndemonstrations. In the predawn hours of April 9, \nhowever, troops using poison gas, sharpened \nshovels and sheer brute force attacked peaceful \ndemonstrators in central Tbilisi, killing at least 19 \npeople and escalating a potentially controllable \nlocal conflict into a national crisis. Central \nauthorities in Moscow immediately disavowed the \nviolence and the republic party chief was replaced. \nHe was succeeded, however, by the republic’s KGB \nchief, a clear signal that Moscow henceforth intend\xad\ned to control events in the republic more closely.\nEvents proceeded more peacefully in the Baltic \nrepublics in this period, but with no less important \nimplications for the development of Soviet politics. \nThe partial democratization of elections to the new \nquasi-legislative body, the Congress of People’s \nDeputies, established by Gorbachev as part of his \noverhaul of central government institutions, \ncreated an opportunity for organized political forces \nlike the popular movements in the Baltic republics \nto win representation in the central policy-making \nprocess. In the March, 1989, elections, Sajudis won \n32 of the 40 seats for which it ran candidates and \nforced runoff elections in the remaining 8.8 Wary of \ngoing too far lest it prompt a conservative reaction, \nSajudis had withdrawn its opposition to Lithuanian \nparty leader Algirdas Brazauskas before the elec\xad\ntion, allowing him to be elected. The Estonian Peo\xad\nple’s Front and the Latvian Popular Front won \nequally impressive electoral victories. Although in\xad\ndividual opposition candidates won victories all \nacross the Soviet Union in the March, 1989, elec\xad\ntions, in some cases defeating prominent party \nfigures, de facto opposition political parties \nemerged only in the Baltic states.\nElectoral victory emboldened not only the polit\xad\nical movements themselves, but the incumbents of \nBaltic republic political institutions as well. In May, \n1989, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, or legis\xad\nlature, asserted the right to veto central legislation \nand called for the independence of the republic, \nechoing the action taken by its Estonian counter\xad\npart in November. The Estonian Supreme Soviet,\n7Chislennost i sostav naseleniya S.S.S.R., p. 124.\n8The New York Times, March 28, 1989.\n9Chislennost i sostav naseleniya S.S.S.R., pp. 126, 128, 136.\n10The New York Times, May 28, 1989.\nmeanwhile, was declaring extensive control over \nthe republic’s economy. The Latvian Popular Front \ntends to be somewhat more cautious than the \nothers, because Latvians are only a bare majority in \ntheir own republic. They constitute only 53.7 per\xad\ncent of the population, while Estonians constitute \n64.7 percent of their republic and Lithuanians 80 \npercent of theirs.9 Nonetheless, in May the Popular \nFront joined the other Baltic popular movements, \nissuing a joint call for United Nations support for \ntheir quest for independence.\nThe Georgian events, the violence in Central \nAsia and the strong representation of the Baltic in\xad\ndependent political movements ensured that na\xad\ntionality issues would be a central concern of the \nnew Congress of People’s Deputies when it con\xad\nvened in Moscow in May, 1989. The Baltic delega\xad\ntions actively pushed their republics’ claims to \nsovereignty, although they failed to win support for \nthe formal adoption of a republic veto over central \nlegislation. Strong opposition from the Lithuanian \ndelegation, shown by a symbolic “walkout” from the \ndeliberations, won a delay in the formation of a \ncommittee empowered to oversee constitutional \nissues. Armenian and Azerbaijani delegates con\xad\ntinued their dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, and \nGeorgian delegates won widespread support for \ntheir condemnation of the use of deadly force in \nTbilisi. Even the politically more conservative \ndelegations from Ukraine, Belorussia and the Cen\xad\ntral Asian republics, whose elections had been \ncarefully “rigged” by local party officials, presented \na litany of regional economic, social and ecological \ncomplaints that took on an ethnic dimension.\nIn response, Gorbachev could only reiterate his \nlong-standing insistence on subordinating regional \ninterests to the national interest. He offered no new \nproposals to meet the growing demands for greater \nregional autonomy, and made no new proposals to \nensure the representation of regional interests in the \nnational policy-making process. Instead, he used \nhis control over what one delegate criticized as an \n“aggressively obedient majority” of the delegates to \nensure that the Congress rejected radical proposals, \nadopted only officially sponsored positions and \nelected a less independent group of its members to \nsit in the new national legislature, the Supreme \nSoviet.10\nAfter securing his own election as President of the \nSoviet Union, Gorbachev asked the Congress to de\xad\nlay local and republic elections, originally sched- \n(Continued on page 359)\nSteven L.

To the degree that the Chinese develop a \nstrong and independent stake in a bilateral detente \nwith Moscow, United States leverage with Beijing \nis diminished. A similar dilemma confronts Amer\xad\nican authorities as they scramble to meet the Soviet \nchallenge in West Europe.\nThere is, finally, the evolution of United States \npolicy toward East Europe, in particular Washing\xad\nton’s response to the political dramas now being \nplayed out in Poland and Hungary. With the con\xad\nclusion of the so-called “roundtable accords” in \nWarsaw on April 6, 1989, inviting the participation \nof a legalized Solidarity in the first contested parlia\xad\nmentary elections in Poland in 40 years, the Bush \nadministration moved quickly to lend its support to \nthe cause of democratization in that embattled \ncountry. It also offered encouragement to Hungar\xad\nian leaders as they struggled uneasily with their own \nprocess of political reform, including the painful \nand sensitive task of reassessing the legacy of the \n1956 revolution. President Bush’s July, 1989, visits \nto Poland and Hungary mixed symbols and sub\xad\nstance, with the American President assuring each \ncountry of the administration’s strong political sup\xad\nport, to be bolstered by the provision of modest \nfinancial assistance.18\nBeyond the commitment of the administration to \ngreater democracy and self-determination for East \nEurope, United States policy toward the region has \na second, less altruistic dimension, to help realize \nmore immediate American objectives. United \nStates interest in and support for the reforms in \nPoland and Hungary constitute a subtle brake on \nSoviet diplomacy in West Europe, reminding \nSoviet leaders that improvements in relations be\xad\ntween one superpower and the allies of the other can \noperate in both directions. It underscores the fact\n17See the account of the President’s news conference concern\xad\ning developments in China, as reported in David Hoffman and \nHelen Dewar, “Bush Suspends Military Sales to China,” The \nWashington Post, June 6, 1989, p. 1.\nThe New York Times, July 11, 1989, and July 13, 1989.\n19The seven Soviet republics in which violent expressions of \nnationalist sentiment have been reported are Armenia, Azer\xad\nbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirgizia, Uzbekistan and \nMoldavia. Ostensibly peaceful protests have occurred in the \nthree Baltic republics and the Ukraine.\n20See The New York Times, June 2, 1989, and June 13, 1989.\n^Moscow’s recent decision to provide military assistance to \nIran is perhaps the best demonstration of the Soviet Union’s \nstrong interest in cultivating better bilateral ties with countries \nidentified by Washington as important regional troublemakers.\nthat while each superpower has something to gain \nin Europe through a reduction in regional tensions, \neach also has something to lose.\nThe Soviet leadership understands only too well \nthe need for an adroit and carefully crafted response \nto United States initiatives in arms control and \nEast-West relations in Europe. Given its preoc\xad\ncupation with domestic issues —from the ongoing \neconomic crisis to the violent expressions of resur\xad\ngent nationalism in at least 7 of the Soviet Union’s \n15 republics19 — the Soviet government must choose \nits battles carefully.\nThe Bush administration is pursuing a more ac\xad\ntive East-West policy in order to maintain the in\xad\nitiative and to offset possible Soviet gains. For this \nreason, Europe will be the scene of intense diplo\xad\nmatic activity over the next 6 to 12 months. Both su\xad\nperpowers are heavily committed, for example, to \nthe success of the CFE negotiations. In this area, \neach superpower has declared that early and \nsubstantial progress is possible and desirable.\nOther issues on the United States-Soviet agenda \nlook less promising, at least in the short run. The \nSTART talks, which resumed in June, 1989, are a \nlong way from completion; Washington is appar\xad\nently in no special hurry to speed up the pace of the \nnegotiations. While much of the agreement has \nbeen drafted, a number of difficult questions have \nyet to be resolved, ranging from what do with the \nStrategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and sea-launched \ncruise missiles to how to develop reliable and \nmutually acceptable procedures to monitor com\xad\npliance.20 The discussions on regional trouble \nspots, to which the administration attaches con\xad\nsiderable importance, have generated only luke\xad\nwarm enthusiasm in Moscow; the Soviet leadership \nprefers to build its own bridges to key regimes in \nAsia, Africa and Latin America.21\nThus it seems reasonable to anticipate a year of \nconsiderable drama but modest achievement in su\xad\nperpower relations. Each government will aim at \nthe political high ground. The real difficulty in \nUnited States-Soviet relations is not talk but action. \nIt is a lesson, one might think, that leaders in Wash\xad\nington and Moscow should have learned long since.\nSOVIET NATIONALITIES \n(Continued from page 344)\nuled for fall, 1989, until spring, 1990.* Given the \nresults of the March elections, the evidence of ex\xad\npanding organizing activity among the national\xad\nities, the continuing economic hardships confront\xad\n* Ed. note: On July 24, Gorbachev announced that local and \nrepublic governments could decide for themselves when they \nwished to hold elections.\n', '3 6 0  •  CURRENT HISTORY, OCTOBER, 1 9 8 9\ning the population and the growing level of ethnic \ntensions, the prospect of local elections in 1990 \nthreatens the party’s control over representative in\xad\nstitutions and, possibly, augurs the emergence of \nnationalist local governments throughout the non- \nRussian territories. But one year of “breathing \nroom” will not reduce the challenge confronting \nMoscow. The politicization of ethnic identity in the \nSoviet Union is the product of broad social pro\xad\ncesses, not temporal events.\nMODERNIZATION AND NATIONALISM\nSince World War II, the Soviet population has \nbeen undergoing a process of rapid social moder\xad\nnization. By the 1980’s, the population had become \nmore urbanized and better educated, and a larger \nproportion of the workforce was employed in white- \ncollar professional positions and as skilled labor. In \nshort, an urban middle class had emerged. This \nprocess was most advanced in the more highly de\xad\nveloped Baltic republics, but it proceeded most \nrapidly in the formerly underdeveloped republics of \nCentral Asia. Social modernization had important \nconsequences for interethnic relations.\nSoviet researchers have reported a positive \nassociation between socioeconomic status and fa\xad\nvorable attitudes toward internationality relations; \nthat is, the higher an individual’s educational level \nand the higher the professional level of his employ\xad\nment, the more likely he is to report favorable at\xad\ntitudes toward interactions with other nationalities. \nThus, social modernization, which improves both \nthe educational level and the socioeconomic status \nof large numbers of people, can have a strong \npositive effect on interethnic relations.11\nThese Soviet researchers point out, however, \nthat their findings were obtained at a time of sub\xad\nstantial upward social mobility, which “could not \nbut prompt in people a sense of satisfaction of na\xad\ntional interests [and] facilitated the formation of \nfriendly interethnic orientations.” Among those \n“overeducated” for their current employment sta\xad\ntus, and those not satisfied with either opportunities \nfor expressing initiative on the job or the job itself, \nattitudes toward internationality relations were not \nso positive. And, when the demand for employment \nexceeded the supply of positions, “this situation \ncreated in people a sense of a certain competition in \nthe labor sphere, which in a multinational context \nwas to a certain degree projected onto national rela\xad\ntions.” In short, it was the experience of upward\nn Y.V. Arutiunian and Y.V. Bromlei, eds., Solsial, no- \nkultumyi oblik Sovetskikh natsii (The social and cultural face of the \nSoviet nation), (Moscow: Nauka, 1986), p. 380.\n12Y.V. Arutiunian and L.M . Drobizheva, Mnogoobrazie \nkultumoi zhizni narodov S. S.S.R. (The multivaried cultural lives of \nthe peoples of the U .S .S .R .), (Moscow: Mysl, 1987).\nmobility rather than the social status of the \nrespondents that was the source of favorable at\xad\ntitudes.\nHowever, these researchers also found that the \nprocess of socioeconomic and cultural development \nthat made accelerated rates of upward social mobili\xad\nty possible also “stimulated the development of \nnational self-awareness.” Moreover, they acknowl\xad\nedged, upward mobility “. . . is not always ac\xad\ncompanied by adequate improvement in the in\xad\nternationality orientation of people, since it is \naccompanied by [increased] expectations.” Indeed, \nthey found that the achievement by nationality \ngroups of “significant representation” in desirable \npositions “. . . created, on the one hand, a sense of \nsatisfaction, but on the other —consistent with the \nlaw of rising expectations — it gave birth to really \nhigh demands, especially among the intelligentsia.”\nIn another recent study, Soviet researchers re\xad\nported that increased educational achievement and \nhigher socioeconomic status were associated with \nan increased orientation toward “the development \nof democracy, economic initiative and the involve\xad\nment of the masses in administration.”12 Their data \nsuggests that in the non-Russian republics this \norientation tends to be stronger among the in\xad\ndigenous nationalities than among Russians. Thus, \nparadoxically, the very success of Soviet develop\xad\nmental efforts has fueled the rise of national self- \nawareness among the peripheral nationalities, and \nthe main beneficiaries of Soviet-sponsored social \nand economic development — the rising native \nelites —are likely to be experiencing the strongest \nincrease in self-awareness.\nThus the politicization of ethnic identity in the \nSoviet Union is a process with three distinct \nsources. First, social modernization increases na\xad\ntional consciousness, produces expectations of con\xad\ntinuing improvements in material well-being and \nsocial status, and leads to aspirations for the expan\xad\nsion of personal freedom and the development of \ndemocracy. Second, the program of political \nreforms launched by Gorbachev has allowed \npopular political forces to organize and gain access \nto the policy process. Third, and most important, \nfrustration of the expectations produced by social \nmodernization has heightened the relevance of na\xad\ntionality, making it an effective basis for the mobil\xad\nization of popular support by political activists and \nconverting national consciousness into nationalism.\nThe frustration of expectations among the na\xad\ntionalities is likely to increase in the short term \nbecause Gorbachev’s program of economic change \nhas been accompanied by a slowdown in Soviet \ngrowth. This has not only worsened material condi\xad\ntions, but may reduce the regime’s ability to con\xad\ntinue to meet the demand for high-status jobi. The\n', 'Articles Concluded •  361\nlatter situation is exacerbated still further by Gor\xad\nbachev’s apparent abandonment of President Leo\xad\nnid Brezhnev’s policy of favoring indigenous per\xad\nsonnel for appointment to elite positions, with the \nimportant exceptions of control over party person\xad\nnel, the secret police (KGB) and the military, in the \nnon-Russian republics.13\nThe inclusion of non-Russian republics in the \nSoviet Union thwarts their aspirations for personal \nfreedom and democracy. As long as the Soviet sys\xad\ntem remains, at best, an authoritarian one-party re\xad\ngime, such aspirations cannot be fulfilled. But, for \nthe Baltic nations, 20 percent of whose populations \nwere 55 years old or older in 1987 —that is, old \nenough to remember their existence as independent \nstates before 1940, even the transition of the Soviet \nUnion to democracy may not relieve the frustration \nof loss of independence.14 Managing the na\xad\ntionalities problem may require even more far- \nreaching political reforms than now seem likely.\nPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENT\nThe rise of nationalism has already had a signifi\xad\ncant impact on the Soviet political system. National \nelections and central representative institutions \nhave become channels for popular political pressure \non the leadership. And, when local elections for re\xad\npublic and local-level representative institutions are \nheld in 1990, these are almost certain to become the \nfocus of demands for expanded republic and local \nautonomy. The political appeal of nationalism has \nhelped create forces that challenge the party’s \nmonopoly over the authoritative decision-making \nprocess in the Soviet Union.\nIn order to sustain the reform process, Gor\xad\nbachev must devise formulas for accommodating \nthese forces while preserving Communist rule. The \nsearch for such formulas has produced a wide-rang\xad\ning debate, reflected in the pages of Soviet journals \nand newspapers.\nMeetings of the leading Soviet researchers on na\xad\ntionality, for example, have included discussion of \nsuch issues as how to define “national interest,” both \nin the sense of all-Soviet (countrywide) interest and \nin the sense of ethnic interest; the nature of econom\xad\nic relations between the republics, the scope of local\n13Steven L.

And it has led \nnaturally to assertions of the need to establish the \nfull panoply of individual civil rights for all citizens, \nregardless of their ethnic status.\nThe juxtaposition of individual and communal \nrights is characteristic of what one participant \ndescribed as “the wide polarization of views” now \ntaking place among Soviet scholars who are at\xad\ntempting to come to grips with the policy implica\xad\ntions of the nationality question. One of the most \nexplosive divisions is between those who focus on \nthe accommodation of demands from the non- \nRussians and those who seek to defend the role, \nstatus and privileges of the Russians. Just as ac\xad\ntivists in the non-Russian republics have called for \nthe establishment of their native languages as their \nofficial state languages, some scholars have argued \nthat Russian should be the official state language of \nthe union as a whole. Similarly, scholars are raising \nimportant questions about the relative status of the \nRussian republic in any future arrangements.\nThe Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic \n(RSFSR) contains 52.4 percent of the Soviet pop\xad\nulation and an even larger proportion of the coun\xad\ntry’s economy and resources.16 Any effort to \nredefine the status of a non-Russian republic there\xad\nfore raises questions about the economic, adminis\xad\ntrative and ethnic regions of the RSFSR, many of \nwhich are at least as important to the union as many \nof the present republics.\nConcern for the status of the Russian language \nand republic is accompanied by concern for the \nstatus of ethnic Russians, especially the 23.9 million \nresident in the non-Russian republics — many of \nthem indigenous residents. This concern unfolds \nagainst a background of rising political activism \namong the Russian people, including growing na\xad\ntionalist sentiments. Russian nationalism not only \nimposes a constraint on efforts to accommodate the \naspirations of the non-Russians, its predominantly\n', '3 6 2  •  CURRENT HISTORY, OCTOBER, 1 9 8 9\nconservative cast represents a powerful basis for the \nmobilization of opposition to concessions to the \nnon-Russians and to the entire reform process. The \nfailure of such an attempt in March, 1988, does not \nguarantee its failure under different circumstances \nin the future.\nClose contact and cooperation among the \npopular political movements in the non-Russian re\xad\npublics will make it difficult for Gorbachev to pur\xad\nsue differentiated policies toward them. Any con\xad\ncession to one republic is likely to engender de\xad\nmands for the same from others. Indeed, the \nurgency of his remarks in July, 1989, indicates that \nGorbachev can ill afford to make any further con\xad\ncessions. Nor can he turn to simple repression.! \nRepression would destroy both the limited free\xad\ndoms of thought and action essential to the success \nof his program of economic reform and the base of \npopular support that has been so important in his \nstruggle against more conservative forces in the \nSoviet leadership.\nThus activist nationalism has pushed Gorbachev \nonto a tightrope shared by till would-be reformers in \nauthoritarian regimes. O n the one hand, he must \navoid going too far too fast, lest he prompt a reac\xad\ntionary intervention by still-powerful conservative \nforces fearing that events are out of control. On the \nother hand, he must move rapidly enough to satisfy \nthose who seek change, to create new constituencies \nof supporters and to combine an alliance of suffi\xad\ncient strength to ensure his victory. H\nfAs of this writing, it is not dear how far Gorbachev will al\xad\nlow the nationalists to go. In August, 1989, the Communist \nparty Central Committee condemned the nationalist move\xad\nments in the Baltic republics, saying that “things have gone [too] \nfar.”\nBOOK REVIEWS \n(Continued from page 346)\nTH E SUBTLEST BATTLE: ISLAM IN\nSOVIET TAJIKISTAN.

(Cambridge: Cam\xad\nbridge University Press, 1988. 298 pages, notes, \nselect bibliography and index, $39.50.)\nThe Soviet Union and the Strategy of Nonalignment in \nthe Third World summarizes the Soviet courtship \nof neutral third world countries and the impact of \n“new thinking” on Soviet third world policy. The \npublishers claim that this is the first study of “the \noverall Soviet conception of nonalignment in the \nthird world.”\nAllison details the successes and failures of \nseveral policy measures, including the pursuit of \n“neutralization” in regions like Southeast Asia, \nthe Persian Gulf and Afghanistan. The Soviet \nUnion and the Strategy of Nonalignment in the Third \nWorld also provides a solid analysis of the primary \ngoal of Soviet policy toward the nonaligned coun\xad\ntries: the military denial of third world areas to \nthe Western powers.
