The\nJohnson bill as finally amended, which\nproposed to temporarily halt all immi\ngration, was adopted today in the house\nby a vote of 293 for, to 41 against the\nmeasure. The bill provides that all\nimmigrants shall be barred for a period\nof one year, but waives blood relatives\nand naturalized immigrants may be\nadmitted.\nWomen and the Ballot\nBusy In Washington Lobbying for\nMaternity Bill\nliniliw ,\nSin Over toll\nBusiness Section Licked by Flames\nFollowing Irish Demonstration\n: Iris\non liifif ft w\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 13. Several\nmonths ago the League of Women Vo\nters announced they would have a sur\nprise awaiting senators and congress\nmen on their return to Washington for\nthe short session of congress. They\ndid. The men not ouly found letters\nand telegrams awa\'ting them alxnit the\nSheppard-T owner maternity and infan\ncy bill, but also a "lobby" of women on\nJ!ftd to ask il.cm to pass this bill it\nthis session.\nA subcommittee of the women\'s joint\ncongressional committee is handling\nthe Sheppard-Towner 11. This com\njnittee is made up t "eprefentatives of\na dozen national women\'s organiza;\ntions, including the National Federa\nJion of Women\'s Clubs.\nSenators and representatives inter\nviewed regarding the "surprise" declar\ned that they had never had so many\nletters and telegrams from their women\nconstituents for any bill, excepting the\nsuffrage amendment.\nIt is thought the bill will receive fav\narable action when brought up, but both\n.houses of congress are averse to taking\nup any new measures at the short ses\nsion.\nMrs. Maud Wood Fark, rational\nchairman of the National League of\nWomen Voters, has the following to\npay regarding the passage of the bill :\n"We agree that the government is\nhard up and should not appropriate\nmore money, but we are only asking for\n$2,500,000 this year, mith a maximum\n(i $4,000,000 in three years, and this\nwill save the lives of countless moth\ners and babies. You don\'t care how\nmany billions are appropriated for the\narmy and the navy, while we are only\nasking for $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.\n"The SheppardJ-Towner bill appro\npriates from $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.\n.which will he divided among the states\nfor promoting the care of maternity\nind infancy through their own agen\ncies. But in order to obtain this money\nfrom the national government each\nstate must appropriate an amount of\nits own equal to that available from the\nnational government. This the state\nlegislatures have to do.\n"It so happens that forty state legis\nlatures will be in session in January.\nSeven of these will adjourn in thirty\ndays, still more of them in sixty days.\nTherefore, if we can\'t get this bill pass\ned through congress in the next few\nweeks many states will be unable to\ntake action on it in 1921 or even in\nJ922, and many state legislatures meet\nonly every two years. They have no\nright to use the money from the Shep-\npard-Towner bill until they appropri\nate money themselves."\nCORK, Dec. 13. Fires wich were\nstarted Saturday night by incendiary\norganizations proved the most disas\ntrous in the history of this Irish city.\nWhole business blocks have been eaten\nup by the flames and the city hall, Car\nnegie library and" other important\nstructures were burned. Many pri-\nresidences were destroyed previous to\nthe fire in the business center.\nUniformed men immediately took the\nsituation in hand and it is believed,\nthat further great destruction will be\nstalled. Buildings on both sides of\nWinthrop street have been wiped out\nand manv ruined on Cork and St. Pat\nrick streets. The damage has not et\nbeen estimated.\nBy United Press\nCork Fires Under Control\nBy United Press\nCORK, Dec. 13. Cork continues to\nburn. Spread over a quarter of a mile\nof the main business section of this\ncity incendiary fires were started Sat\nurday night and swallowed up much\nproperty. The losses are estimated at\nnear $15,000,000. Two thousand per\nsons are out of work, with banking\nhouses, drapers and other shops with\nthe city hall destroyed. Altogether fif\nty buildings were burned. The Sinn\nFein\' leaders charge the destruction to\nthe "black and tan" officials. The\nIrish office admits that some of the\nfires outside of Cork were started by\nthe police in reprisal for an attack on\ntheir lorries, which resulted in the\ndeath of one soldier and the wounding\nof several others. It is declared that\nthe fires in the city were too well plan\nned to have been carried out by the\nangered police with no time to arrange\ndetails.\nWill Recommend Such a Course to\nthe House Committee\nBy United Press\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 13. An agree\nment between England, Japan and the\n.United States to limit their naval arm\naments doesn\'t meet with favor with\nSecretary of the Navy Danielsi,the sec\nretary told newspaper men today. Dan\niels said he would endorse an- under\nStanding to reduce this country\'s sea\npower in the event the reduction was\nworld-wide in character. An agree-\nmen among any certain powers would\nappear too much like an alliance and\nwould arouse the suspicions of the oth\ner nations, said the secretary. He indi\ncated that when he goes tefore the\n,house naval affairs committee to report\njtomorrow on his1 naval construction\nprogram, he will urge an increase in\nihe American navy as imperative until\nthe United States enters a world-wide\ndisarmament movement.\nNewspapers Are Censured\nBy United TressJ\nDUBLIN, Dec. 13. Ninety Ameri\ncan, English and Irish newspaper cor\nrespondents here today declared they\nhave been intimidated by the military\nand police in their efforts to report the\nevents happening in Ireland. They de\ncided, therefore, to put their charges\nin a circular letter to be addressed to\nall the governments and press associa\ntions in America and Europe. The\nwriters charge they were prevented\nfrom witnessing many of the disturb\nances and were hampered by the mili\ntary in their efforts to report events as\nthey actually occurred.\nto Ms Up to the Mute\nWEDDED DURING THE WAR\nBy United Press\nBERLIN, Dec. 13, by mail..... ieit\nBERLIN, Nov. 25, by mail. Sixty\nper cent of German divorces at this\nitime are of couples wedded during the\n,war. Twenty per cent of all divorce\nare attributable to war incidents, main\nly unfaithfulness during the war.\nStatistics also show that many\nfouples during the war and since then\nare marrying far younger than before\n(lie war.

The fiercest\nfighting since the Easter rebellion, in\n1916 is raging today in many parts of\nIreland.

A pitched battle\nbetween Sinn Feiners and Scottish\nHighlanders occurred near Cloyne to\nday, after the Irish had ambushed the\nScottish troops. The Irish office an\nnounced that one Sinn Feiner was kill\ned and several wounded. A number of\nprisoners were taken by the highland-\ners and one soldier wounded.\nGermany Protests Award\nBy United Press\nGENEVA, Dec. 13. The German\nurovernment has presented a new note\nto the assembly of the League of Na\ntions refusing to recognize the decision\nof the council of the league regarding\nthe award of Eupen and Malmedy, for\nmerly German territory, to Belgium.\nMany Injured la Crash\nBy Mmiloi Presa \'\nDENVER. Dec. 13. Twelve person\nwere injured, but none fatally, when\ntwo street cars crashed together here\nthis morning. The collision occurred\nat a crossing. Both cars were partially\ndemolished.\nWomen Disappoint\nLady Astor, M. P.\nday by Sinn Feiners. One policeman\nwas killed and three severely wounded\nin five-hour fight, during which one\nwall of the building was blown in. Po\nlice baracks at Camlough were also at\ntacked and it is reported that several\nwere killed. All wires were cut there,\nso there is no confirmation of the re\nport. A detachment of soldiers enroute\nto their rescue was fired upon. They\nreturned the shots, killing one Sinn\nFeiner. ,\nBy United Tress\nLONDON, Dec 1. by mail Lady\nAstor is disappointed in women.\nAnd she told them s in a speech\nwhich she made to masses of them at\nthe opening of the Englishwoman\'s Exhibition.\n"I am glad that the days of the cling\ning, dependent woman are over," she\nsaid. "When I was a child I used to\nread about heroines who fainted at the\nsight of a rat and wondered if I would\ngrow up like that."\nHowever, while admitting that wom\nen have outgrown these puerilities, she\ndeplored their lack of logic in the mat\nter of dress.\n"This is a testing time for women,"\nshe continued, "hut when I walk down\nBond street and see the way they dress,\nI think they have been tested, and have\nfailed. What should we think if men\nchanged the length of their trousers\nevery year." she asked.\nLady Astor appealed to the women\nto derss more sensibly, as men do. Her\nidea seemed to be that if their skirts\nreached a logical conclusion, their\nbrains might get there some day, too.\nAnother grudge which Lady Astor\nhas against women is their absolute\nJack of loyalty. Slie declared that wom\nen would not vote for women, just be\ncause they were women whereas men\nfiever refrained from voting for a\n.member of their own sex merely be\ncause he was of that sex.\nJudging from opinions expressed by\nmemlers of the audience, most of the\nwomen there were entirely in accord\nwith Lady Astor. They agreed that in\nthe main women were foolish creatures.\nThat is why they vote for men.\nMary\nMacLaren In\n6 The Road to Divorce\'\nREWARD\nLone child seeks parents. When last\nseen they were on "The Road to Di\nvorce." For further information in\nquire at the C. and C. theater box office\ntonight. f\nNo married couple, or young people\nabout to embark on the uncertain sea\nof matrimony, should fail to see "The\nRoad to Divorce," the Universal photo\ndrama starring Mary MacLaren, which\nis to be shown at the C. and C. theater\ntonight.\nAside from its gripping story, its\nwonderful photographic effects and the\nsplendid acting by the star and her\nsupporting company the photoplay\ncontains a lesson by which every young\nman and woman may profit.\nMost of the unhappiness that comes\nXo young married people is through\ndisillusionment. The husband forgets\nthose little gallantries that character\ntzed his courting days, while the wife\nneglects to make the most of her per\nsonal charms. Their romance shatter\ned the two drift apart, although deep\nin their hearts their love remains the\nsame.\nIn "The Road to Divorce," Mary\nMacLaren plays the part of a New-\nEngland girl who is married to a rising\nphysician. When babies come the\nyoung wife is so occupied with her\nchildren and domestic duties that she\nbecomes careless of her appearance and\nneglectful of her husband. A carefully\ngroomed, well informed girl comes to\nvisit and the wife suffers by contrast.\nA family tragedy is imminent, when a\nthreatened calamity causes the husband\nto realize his true feelings for the girl\nhe married.\nAdditional attractions will be Para-\nFEDERAL GRAND JURY\nDOES MUCH BUSINESS\nThe greatest volume of business ever\nturned over by a federal grand jury\nwas handled last week when a total of\neighty-five indictments were reported to\nJudge Farrington.\nDuring the week\'s session 108 cases\nwere reviewed and evidence of some\nnature considered. Practically 90 per\ncent of the cases were for the violation\nof the federal prohibition act.\nAs a number of the bills returned are\nagainst persons not yet placed under\narrest the list of indictments was not\nmade public. " This undoubtedly will\nkeep some of the people who have been\non the shady side of the law guessing.\n, During the time of the Indian whisky\ntraffic, when it was customary to han\ndle a lot of cases there was never such\na lisi presented to a grand jury for\nconsideration. As the reports come\nfrom over the state it seems that an\nother batch of prohibition violators are\naccumulating, which portends a perpet\nual grinding of the mill of justice.\nIt is not believed that trial juries will\nbe called before the middle of January,\nfor at least until after the holidays.\nmount Magazine and Comic Cartoons.\nTwo shows; regular price of admission.\nFrom all appearances the list of jury\nmen will be something that will occupy\nthe attention of the business public\nRIGHT OF WAY CASE\nThe hearing of the right of way dam\nage through the Ira Winters ground\nand the Sala strip in Washoe county is\nto be heard in Reno today.\nThis when settled will bring the pro\nposed highway to the foot of the Lake-\nview lane, making practically a\nstraight-away road\' from Lakeview to\nWashoe.\nThe right of way between Carson and\nReno has been a complex proposition,\nas the old road skirted the tarms on\nthe west side and in many instances the\nstraightening of the course necessitated\ncondemnation suits. \' So far the high\nway commission and Washoe county\nhave managed to get what they deemed\nto be the right consideration in the\nscore or more of suits.\nANTI-CIGARETTE LAW\nAn attempt to enact an anti-cigarette\nlaw in Nevada will be made by the\nNevada W.

The essence of the Argentine program is\nthat we should proceed from the present moment as if the war had\nheen neither won nor lost ly anybody. Argentine, which did not\nfight the war at all, practically objects that the league is yet a league\nof the victorious nations and not yet a league of all the peoples of the\nworld. Granted. (Jranted also that it must eventually he a league of\nall the nations if it is to perform the supremely important tasks and\ntill the paramount role assigned it.\nHut the pertinent question is: Has the time arrived for this in\nevitable and extremely desirable stage in its development? The\nopinion of the nations which filled the military cemeteries in North\nern France in a desperate tight to prevent the domination of the\nworld bv one nation, and bv one class in that nation, is that the\nwholesome davs of repentance are not yet unite fulfilled, and that)\nit is a little too soon to invite the violators of Helgium, the ravishers\nof Lille, the brutal scorners of every Hague restriction intended to\nmitigate the horrors of civilized warfare, the perpetrators of the sub\nmarine assassinations, into the friendly councils of the family of\nnations.\nWe all agree that there can be no permanent League of Nations\nwith Germany and Kussia outside, to say nothing of the I\'nited\nStates. It is. merely a question of date. It would be a mistake, for\nexample, to open t lit doors today to Soviet Russia. That would be\nworse than "shakinn hands with murder"; it would be the incred-\nibl folly of inviting a man into your home who made it an open\nboast that he carried a bomb in his pocket with which to blow it up.\nYet, as Colonel House has so well said, we cannot go along forever\nwithout the llussian people. "They hold, perhaps as no other people\ndo, the final destiny of the human race."\nSurely it is plain to all who do not blind themselves to the un\nstable welter in which the unparalleled upheaval of the war has left\nlar!"1 sections f the world that there must still be the strong arm\nstn !(! ed firth to keep the peace en more than one front. Were the\nvie\': rKun Allies to forget their victory and the grim need for it and\nretiii\' blandly into the "pacifist" paradise which preceded the war\nin most democratic, countries, we should soon find that the war was\nbv no means over, but was still being fought fiercely in manv a cock\npit. The world todav is like a great edifice which has been swept by\na mighty conflagration that has at last been brought under control,"\nbut which still smolders and names up in many a corner when the\nattention of the fire brigade has been called elsewhere. It is too soon\nyet to call otT the brigade and take down all the fire lines and act as\nif a condition of "normalcy" had been reached. That will come,\nlint for any nation to leave the league now because the majority\nare not quite ready for it including the still bleeding and crippled\nFrench is inevitably to awake the suspicion that is being voiced\n5n more than one quarter in Allied Hurope that there were Argen\ntineans who might not have wept too bitterly if Germany had won.\nThe hope will be that the A regent ine nation will insist on stay\ning in the league and "playing the game." None of the nations who\ndo stay are entirely satisfied with the covenant as the compromise of\nParis left it. We are not satisfied in the I\'nited States. Canada has\nreminded us t hat she was not satisfied, having always opposed the\nmuch-debated Article X.\nWe are all ready on this side of the Atlantic to send great\nsquadrons and vast armies to Europe or Asia or the ends of the earth\nwhin a titanic crisis arises, like the German raid on civilization; but\nwe are none of us ready to send a single matt to die in some squalid\nlocal quarrel in which we are not even remotely concerned, whose in\nterlaced issues we do not understand and whose possible peril as a\ndisturber of the general peace cuild be easily dealt with by neighbor\ning military states. We would not ask Europe to keep Mexico or\nf\'osta Rica quiet, and we do not expect Europe to ask us to keep\nLetvia and Lithuania from each other\'s throats.\nAll these early attacks upon the constitution of the league open\nthe door to what has been understood to be the Harding policy.\nPresident-elect Harding proposes to call the nations together to draft\na new league covenant, using as much of the old timber as will serve.\nObviously many of the nations now in the league are more than ready\nfor this adventure, provided nothing is done to weaken the grip of\nthe Treaty of Versailles in the meantime. This can be safeguarded\nby making sure that the new building is finished, habitable and capa\nble of sheltering the principles and eternal purposes of the Treaty of\nVersailles before those who fear that the war will have been fought\njn vain, if the moral framework of that treaty falls to the ground,\nare asked to move out of the first largely experimental structure\nwhich was hammered together amidst so many distractions in Paris.\nAlready the papers over the west, and even in Nevada, are be\nmoaning the lynching that took place in California. A lot of the\npapers are decrying the blot that has been placed on the fair shield\nof that commonwealth. The old story of besmearing the escutcheon\nof the state is being flouted. It was ever thus; there has to be some\nthing said and most of the papers refrain from approving lyneJiing\nmethods.\nThe turth of the matter is that the citizens of the Santa Rosa\nsection did one of the best pieces of business that has been done in\nmany years. When it comes to the blot of shame the place to look\nfor it is in the conditions existing which allowed the dastardly crimes\not the men hanged. Jt there was ever a spattering of shame on the fair\nname of a state is was by this organized set of assaults and murders. !\nNo lynching could daub an escutcheon to the extent that this outfit i\nhad already soiled it with its unmentionable crimes. \'\n. The best test of -the temper of the peope on these matters is the!\nindividual opinion. The public of this state as a body not only ap-\nproves of the Santa Rosa incident, but goes so far as to state that the I\nwhole set of gangsters should be man-handled in a like manner. Ask\nyour neighbor and he will Okeh such a statement. j\nThe three men were lynched at Santa Rosa for murder, but the\nreal incentive back of the hanging was the enormity of the crime !\nagainst women, most of them young girls in their teens.\nThis lynching will have a effect that will clear the situation\nfor a long time to come. It was a necessity and if there is a regret\nit is that the San Francisco outfit was not rounded up and stretched\nwith the three in Santa Rosa.\nLord Bryce\'s announcement that the world is at the brink of an\nabyss is reassuring.
