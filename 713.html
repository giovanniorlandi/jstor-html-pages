        <pre>['AGRONOMIC AFFAIRS I 7 5  \nIn the Tennessee Valley there are thousands of farms where the operating \nprogram for several years past is a matter of record. Here the soils and their \ncharacteristics have been mapped and, to a large degree, their adaptability deter- \nmined. If these farms are representative of those in the rest of the United States, \nsuitable nitrogen fertilizers (properly supplemented with other elements) can be \nused in very large quantities-perhaps as much as may be available after the \nwar. Heretofore, when nitrogen was scarce, it was important to get the maximum \ncrop production per unit of nitrogen; when nitrogen gets plentiful, it becomes \nimportant to get the maximum production per acre of land suitable for intensive \nproduction. The value, effect, and best methods of use of nitrogen in this situation \nmust be determined, through testing on the whole farm as a unit and on many \nfarms. \nSTUDENT SECTION ESSAY CONTEST \nHE Committee on Student Sections of the American Society of T Agronomy has agreed that it is undesirable to continue the essay \ncontest during the present emergency. It is the hope of the Com- \nmittee that it may be possible to resume this worthwhile activity \nimmediately after the end of the war. Announcement will be made \nas soon as the contest can be arranged for in the future. \nNEWS ITEMS \nSIR JOHN RUSSELL retired September 30 last under the age limit \nas Director of the Rothamsted Experiment Station. The Station \nwill attain its one hundredth anniversary this year. \n-A- \nDOCTOR THEODORE DYKSTRA of the Bureau of Plant Industry and \nDoctor WALTER C.
