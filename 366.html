        <pre>["Reviews 295 \nMathematical Statistics. By S. S. WILKS. \n[Pp. 284+xi. Princeton University Press. Lithoprinted. 1943. $3.75] \nTHE subject of ‘mathematical statistics’ did not attain to the dignity of text-book \ntreatment until 1906, when a work by Blaschke, the Viennese actuary, was \npublished. Two years later Laurent, a member of the Institut des Actuaires \nFrancais, produced the second text-book. At about the same time; in England, \nElderton was writing his well-known treatise, although he did not choose to \nentitle it ‘mathematical statistics’. It was ten years before a further book \nappeared, though to-day there are a dozen in existence-Blaschke (1906), \nLaurent (1908), West (1918), Charlier (192O), Rietz et al. (1924), Rietz (1927), \nJordan (1927), Darmois (1928), Risser and Traynard (1933), Anderson (1935), \nAitken (1939), Wolfenden (1942). Of the later authors, only the last is an \nactuary; the rest are University teachers. \nIn all these books the frequency distribution, whether uni- or multi-variate, \nassumes a central role, and consideration is given to the derivation of measures \ncharacterizing it (e.g. mean, mode, coefficient of correlation) : sampling and the \nLexis theory appear (though often not too clearly) as applications of the ideas \nthus developed. The mathematics employed is usually of a standard roughly \nequivalent to that of the Institute’s Preliminary Examination. \nPrior to Wilks’s book under review, no text-book on mathematical statistics \nhad given prominence to the theories of estimation and tests of statistical hypo- \ntheses which are so fundamental to the important present-day applications of \nmathematical probability. These theories date from Fisher’s classical papers in \nthe early 1920's and the Neyman-Pearson work published about 1930, and \nrequire for their understanding many of the previously developed concepts \nrelating to distribution functions. However, the basic mathematics is now of \ndegree standard and it has yet to be seen whether these theories can be satis- \nfactorily understood by a student without considerable mathematical knowledge. \nWilks’s book, in fact, is based on a series of lectures delivered at Princeton to \ngraduate and advanced undergraduate students of mathematics. These lectures \nseem to have been the lineal descendants of those on which his previous mono- \ngraph, Statistical Inference (1937), was founded, though there are some inte- \nresting differences of outlook noticeable in the two treatments where they over- \nlap. There are no numerical illustrations : the work is a mathematical treatment \nof statistical problems. \nIn the Introduction there is as good a résumé of the fundamental ideas under- \nlying probability theory and their links with experience as the reviewer has ever \nseen : ‘The test of the applicability of the mathematics in this field as in any \nother branch of applied mathematics, consists in comparing the predictions as \ncalculated from the mathematical model with what actually happens experi- \nmentally.’ There follow two chapters on cumulative distribution (ogive) func- \ntions defined with due mathematical rigour: the Riemann-Stieltjes integral is \nused after definition and proof of some of its properties, but more complex types \nof integrals and the related measure theory are considered beyond the level of \nthe student. Characteristic functions are not used, presumably because they \nrequire a knowledge of a specialized mathematical technique: instead the con- \nceptually similar, but mathematically less powerful, generating function is \nemployed. Although contour integration is assumed familiar, beta- and gamma- \nfunctions are given explanatory space. A noteworthy change in the author’s \nviews is his desertion of the von Mises definition of probability, which was a \nfeature of his earlier book. \n", '296 Reviews \nChapters IV and v develop the mathematics of sampling from the definition: \na random sample of size n of values of x from a population with cumula- \ntive distribution function F (x) is a set of n random variables x1, x2, . . ., xn \nwith cumulative distribution function These first five chapters and \nChapter x on combinatorial statistical theory (the theory of runs, etc.) apply \nthe mathematics of probability theory to the discovery of various types of \ndistribution laws. \nIn the remaining five chapters there is a valuable exposition of the theories of \nestimation and testing statistical hypotheses-modem statistical method. \nAlthough Fisher’s arguments against fiducial limits calculated in respect of \ndiscrete distributions are not mentioned-perhaps because Wilks cannot agree \nwith them--there is a clear and thorough explanation of the Fisherian theory of \nestimation. The Neyman-Pearson likelihood method of testing hypotheses is also \ntreated very fully and applications of it to regression, analysis of variance, and \nmulti-variate hypotheses are detailed. The more fundamental approach through \nthe properties of the power function is, however, only touched on, and Pitman’s \nhighly significant contributions are not mentioned. \nTo anyone who wishes to know what problems the statistician of to-day is \nsuccessfully tackling, Wilks’s excellent book will be indispensable. It provides \nthe only comprehensive, step-by-step, mathematical treatment of modem \nstatistical technique. H.L.S. \nThe Future Population of Europe and the Soviet Union. By FRANK W. NOTE- \nSTEIN and others of Princeton University. \n[Pp. 315, Series of League of Nations Publications, 1944. British agents- \nGeorge Allen & Unwin, Ltd. 12s. 6d.] \nHow will fertility and old-age mortality change in this country during the next \nthirty years? The plain answer is-nobody knows. Can we obtain any guidance \nfrom the changes during the past twenty-five years? The plain answer is-very \nlittle. Yet these are two of the most critical factors in the population problem. \nIt is true that the number of persons who in thirty years’ time will be aged \nbetwéen 30 and 65 can, apart from the effects of war, migration and the \npossibility of catastrophic epidemic, be closely estimated, since they are already \nborn and since widely different mortality assumptions over the relevant age- \nrange produce only small proportionate differences in the survival factors. \nBut the population aged under 30 in thirty years’ time depends on future \nfertility and the population aged over 65 depends on future old-age mortality. \nWill fertility fall substantially from the 1938-39 level, or be stabilized at about \nthat level, or reach, and remain at, a higher level? What causes underlie the \nsubstantial rise in fertility in the years 1942-44 and the recession in the second \nquarter of 1945 ? Can the war-time rise properly and wholly be explained by \nthe higher number of marriages in the early years of the war? Is it right to \nassume that the ‘marginal’ fertility of the ‘extra’ marriages is similar to the \n‘average’ fertility? Will old-age mortality fall slightly or, as implied in the \ngeneration theory, fall substantially, or remain stationary or even increase over \nthe next thirty years? These are some of the largely unanswerable questions \nwhich spring to the actuarial mind on reading the book. \n']</pre>
