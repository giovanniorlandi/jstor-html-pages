        <pre>['12\nEuthanasia and morally\njustifiable killing in a veterinary\nclinical context\nEuthanasiaandmorallyjustifiablekilling\nAnne Fawcett\nBrisbane vet Michael O’Donoghue has seen many people have to\ngive up, or put down, their pets because they could not find a rental\nproperty that welcomed animals. ‘It’s very heartbreaking, people euthanasing\ntheir beloved pet because they can’t find accommodation’,\nhe said. (Nancarrow 2012)\nIn Australia, urban companion animal-ownership per capita is\ndeclining in tandem with falls in living space. Despite this reduced\ndemand, the pet industry uses positive imagery and targeted research\nto promote pet acquisition, helping to maintain a situation in\nwhich supply generally exceeds demand. This results in the annual\neuthanasia of thousands of excess animals from shelters and pounds.\n(McGreevy & Bennett 2010)\nThe quotations above highlight challenges for pet-owners in urban\nAustralia, namely reduced living space and increased difficulty in finding\nappropriate rental or permanent accommodation that allow pets.\nBut what I would like to highlight in the above is the use of the term\n‘euthanasia’ in both pieces to describe the killing of animals due to lack\nof space and/or excess supply. In this essay I will analyse what I see\nA Fawcett (2013). Euthanasia and morally justifiable killing in a veterinary clinical\ncontext. In J Johnston & F Probyn-Rapsey (Eds). Animal death. Sydney: Sydney\nUniversity Press.\n205\n', 'as an unjustifiable double standard operating in current thinking surrounding\nkilling animals and killing humans, and the word ‘euthanasia’\nas applied to animals and humans as it enshrines that double standard.\nThe term is traditionally applied to killing aimed at preventing suffering\nin animals for which reasonable interventions are either exhausted\nor not available and where quality of life is poor. This might be construed\nas killing an animal in its interests. But the term is often applied\nto animal killing in which the above criteria do not apply, or in which\nkilling is not truly in the animal’s interests. Veterinarians are trained to\nkill animals humanely (with minimal suffering) and are often called to\ndo so in practice. Misappropriation of the term ‘euthanasia’ may be a\nsource of moral stress for veterinarians, as it may not only obscure the\nmotivation for killing, but the interests of the one who is killed. Animals\nclearly have interests independent of their owners, and these are in\na different logical category from imagined projections about how they\nmay or may not fare if their owner surrenders them.\nIn reality, the killing of an animal is often not a case of ‘euthanasia’,\nno matter how painless, dignified and legally sanctioned that happens\nto be, because the interests of the animal are not served. Like us, animals\nmay be willing to persevere with less than perfect fulfilment of\ntheir interests in some conditions. It is only in cases that are analogous\nto cases of human euthanasia where the animal’s interests are served\nby killing; for example, cases of debilitating or incurable illness. Yet\nit seems that the term ‘euthanasia’, where animals are concerned, is\nsynonymous with any death effected by a veterinarian. If the life of\nyour companion animal is ended by a veterinarian, it is likely that service\nwill be invoiced under the category ‘euthanasia’ regardless of the\nreason. That is unproblematic if we accept the American Veterinary\nMedical Association’s (AVMA) definition of euthanasia, as defined in\nits Guidelines on euthanasia, as a death ‘that occurs with minimal pain\nand distress. In the context of these guidelines, euthanasia is the act\nof inducing humane death in an animal’ (AVMA 2007). But what this\ndefinition fails to explain is that not all humane deaths are equal. It may\nbe possible to induce a painless, rapid death in a healthy person by administering\na toxin without that person’s knowledge – but we call that\nmurder, not euthanasia. The above use of the term fails to capture the\nmorally significant difference between the killing of an animal to prevent\npresent suffering, killing of an animal to prevent inevitable or at\nAnimal death\n206\n', 'least likely future suffering, and the killing of a perfectly healthy animal\nbecause it is unwanted (by a particular owner or society at large).\nThe AVMA guidelines make no claim to pronouncing on ethical\ndilemmas such as the euthanasia of healthy, unwanted animals – although\nit states that such concerns are ‘complex and warrant thorough\nconsideration by the profession and all those concerned with the welfare\nof animals’ (AVMA 2007). Rather, the authors take the view that\n‘if an animal’s life is to be taken, it is done with the highest degree of\nrespect, and with an emphasis on making the death as painless and disease\nfree as possible’ (AVMA 2007).\nI support the existence of such guidelines as they ensure that prevention\nof suffering in bringing about death is a central and critical\nanimal welfare consideration. What is at issue here is whether all forms\nof humane killing constitute ‘euthanasia’, and whether it is important to\nmake the distinction. The danger is that the term ‘euthanasia’ becomes\na euphemism, a means of easing moral discomfort we might otherwise\nhave about killing animals in certain contexts. As one colleague who\ndid not wish to be identified commented:\nUsing the term in this way does make ‘euthanasia’ almost pleasant\nwhen in practice in many situations it is extremely uncomfortable,\nweakly justifiable and just feels wrong. It’s not very honest but it\ncushions the blow and helps me cope in the long run. (personal communication\n2012)\nLumping all veterinary-effected animal deaths in the same moral basket\nposes a danger to animals as well as veterinarians, hospital staff and pet\nowners.\nEuthanasia and morally justifiable killing\nThe term euthanasia is derived from the Greek ‘eu’, for good, and\n‘thanatos’, or death. Given how much energy living creatures devote\nto avoiding death, the pairing of the words is intuitively oxymoronic.\nThe term ‘good’ is philosophically loaded and may be interpreted differently\nin different contexts. A ‘good’ death may be used to describe a\ndeath ranging from pleasant to the dying individual, to a death that is\n12 Euthanasia and morally justifiable killing\n207\n', 'neutral or free of suffering, to a death that is ethically sound. For some\nthis means accepting one’s demise and going peacefully. According to\none popular Christian funeral homily, ‘the Christian who has suffered\nlong, and who has died in peace and with dignity, has lived the Gospel’\n(Mulvihill 1990).\nFor those whose loved one dies in the agonising throes of terminal\nagitation, such demise is neither good in any physical sense nor good\nwithin this belief system. The question of whether one’s behaviour in\none’s terminal moments determines the quality of one’s afterlife has\nbeen the subject of much religious and philosophical speculation. Not\nsurprisingly, there is no simple answer to what constitutes a ‘good’\ndeath for humans.\nIt may, however, come as a surprise to learn that on day one of\ngraduation, veterinarians are expected to be competent in matters pertaining\nto euthanasia. According to the United Kingdom’s Royal Col-\nlege of Veterinary Surgeons, a new graduate must be able to:\n1. Recognise when euthanasia is necessary\n2. Perform it humanely\n3. Be familiar with methods of euthanasia and select the appropriate\nmethod\n4. Display sensitivity to the feelings of owners and others\n5. Perform euthanasia with due regard for the safety of those present\n6. Advise on carcase disposal. (RCVS 2006, adapted from section\nC1.15)\nThis assumes that euthanasia is performed by veterinarians only when\nit is ‘necessary’, but provides no criteria by which a veterinarian may\njudge euthanasia to be necessary or not. That depends on one’s working\ndefinition of the term euthanasia.\nPavlovic and colleagues argue that the word ‘euthanasia’ has been\nflagrantly misused and abused, most notably by the German Nazi party,\nand by those killing animals in scientific experiments (Pavlovic et al.\n2011). For some, they argue, the word has been irreversibly tainted\nthrough its association with crimes against humanity.\nThe authors point out that it is not satisfactory to define euthanasia\nas ‘the act or practice of killing or permitting the death of hopelessly\nsick or injured individuals (as persons or domestic animals) in a relatively\npainless way for reasons of mercy’ (Merriam-Webster Online\nAnimal death\n208\n', 'Dictionary 2011) as this does not take into account the interests of\nthe individual, who, despite being ‘hopelessly sick’, may wish to live,\nor at least wish not to die. Furthermore, such a definition may excuse\nsomeone – be it a war criminal, or a scientist experimenting on animals,\nfrom causing a state of hopeless, irreversible, terminal illness, such that\nending the life of that being – when viewed in isolation – appears to be\nconsistent with euthanasia.\nTo avoid such misappropriation of the term, Pavlovic et al. argue\nthat the entire procedure – including causing that individual to be in\nthat state – must be taken into account (which is why they reject the use\nof the term ‘Nazi euthanasia program’). Instead, they propose a twopronged\ndefinition, suggesting that ‘euthanasia’ be defined as:\na) an act which fulfils the interests of the one who will die\nb) an act motivated by a moral imperative – for example, ‘to save\nfrom suffering somebody who explicitly expressed such a desire’.\n(Pavlovic et al. 2011)\nThus the termination of laboratory animals for the purposes of experimentation\ndoes not meet the conditions for ‘euthanasia’. The authors do\nnot overtly call for the end of terminal laboratory animal experiments,\nnor do they equate Nazi war crimes with experiments on laboratory\nanimals. Their objective is to preserve the notion of ‘a good death’ to\npermit patients to express their desires and ensure others respect their\ndignity – while protecting the concept from misuse.\nPavlovic argues that it is challenging to apply his work on reorienting\nthe concept of euthanasia to a veterinary clinical context. He feels\nthat the circumstances in which animals are killed – whether in their\ninterests or not – are so different from those of humans that the term\n‘euthanasia’ should be applied exclusively where the patient is human\n(Pavlovic, personal communication 2012).1 Unlike a human patient,\nwho may make their wishes known prior to death, either directly or via\na will, directions to a family member or legal representative, the nonhuman\npatient is unable to convey their interests nor consent to or dictate\nthe timing of euthanasia – or even the place. Where a patient cannot\nconvey his or her interests, there is huge scope for error.2 End-of-life\n1 He suggests the term ‘mercy killing’ to apply to situations where the suffering\nof an animal is deemed to outweigh the benefit of survival. (Pavlovic, personal\ncommunication 2012)\n12 Euthanasia and morally justifiable killing\n209\n', 'care typically requires pet owners and veterinarians to make decisions\nof monumental consequences (life and death), while feeling that they\nlack critical information (Shanan 2011). In particular, decision-making\naround whether to pursue treatment (Is it realistic? Is it fair? Is it likely\nto result in further or at least prolong suffering?) versus concerns about\nending the life of an animal prematurely can be very difficult to address.\nMuch has been written about, and many schemata formulated for,\nassessing quality of life, a discussion of which is beyond the scope of\nthis essay. Suffice to say, there remains no consensus on measurement\nof quality of life, and no clear cut-offs on the quality of life continuum.\nMost significantly, ‘there is no objective point below which quality of\nlife is unacceptable’ (Shanan 2011). Furthermore, veterinarians may be\ncalled upon to end the life of an animal for a range of reasons including\nbut not limited to:\n• terminal illness or injury\n• overpopulation (particularly in the context of animal shelters but\nalso in the case of animal hoarding (Joffe et al. in preparation)\n• legal issues (a council declaration or court order of a nuisance or\ndangerous animal)\n• change of circumstances (for example, lack of house-training or a\nrequirement for an onerous medication regime; the family member\nwho was caring for that particular animal has passed away or been\nadmitted to hospital/hospice care; the owner is moving to a dwelling\nthat does not accommodate pets etc.)\n• financial inability on the part of the owners to fund treatment (often\nreferred to as ‘economic euthanasia’)\n• treatment not available (for example, dialysis for treatment of acute\nkidney failure is not widely available in Australian veterinary hospitals)\n2 Of course human patients cannot always communicate their wishes – their\nphysical and/or mental state may prevent them from doing so. In such cases,\nproxies (close family members, carers and representatives) may be asked to\ndetermine that person’s interests or wishes. But studies which compare\ndecision-making by proxies to decisions made by patients who can communicate\nhave shown that even close relatives and experienced health professionals have a\nlimited ability to correctly predict what the patient perceives as best for themselves\nor in their own interests. (Shanan 2011)\nAnimal death\n210\n', '• concerns that treatment may reduce quality of life\n• failure of an animal to meet the expectations of the owner\n• public health concerns (for example, in the event of an outbreak of a\nzoonotic disease such as Hendra virus, affected animals may be sacrificed\nto contain spread of the disease)\n• biosecurity (for example, where outbreak of a non-endemic disease\nof economic importance such as Newcastle disease or foot and\nmouth disease, affected animals may be sacrificed to contain spread\nof the disease).\nMany of the above reasons do not satisfy the aforementioned criteria to\nbe labelled ‘euthanasia’ – many satisfy (b) but do not necessarily satisfy\n(a).\nIn 1984, philosopher Tom Regan posed more stringent conditions\nfor the use of the term euthanasia in application to animals, specifically\nthat:\n1. killing must be by the most painless means possible\n2. that it must be believed to be in the animal’s best interests and this\nmust be a true belief\n3. one who kills must be motivated by concern for the interest, good\nor welfare of the animal involved. (Regan 1984)\nFew of the above situations would satisfy these criteria. For example, if\na shelter veterinarian euthanases a healthy dog because they believe it\nis in the dog’s best interests, this in Regan’s view is not a true belief and\ntherefore does not satisfy (b). It may be well intentioned killing – but it\nis not euthanasia.\nThere are situations where killing may be deemed morally justifiable\neven if it does not meet the criteria for euthanasia. Consider the\nexample of an aggressive dog, declared by the local council to be dangerous\nafter biting a passer-by without provocation. Despite attempts to\nconfine this particular dog, it escapes and attacks a child. In such a case,\nit is likely that the owners will be fined and the dog will be ordered to\nbe destroyed.\nLegal issues aside, when all stakeholders are taken into account (the\nowner, the dog, the community, legal institutions and so forth), it may\nbe possible to make an argument that terminating the life of that dog\nis morally justifiable on the grounds that the outcome would lead to\n12 Euthanasia and morally justifiable killing\n211\n', 'the greatest good for the greatest number of stakeholders. The death\nis not in the animal’s interests, but it is motivated by the imperative of\npreventing the suffering of multiple stakeholders and therefore morally\njustifiable.3\nYeates provides less stringent criteria, suggesting that the term\n‘euthanasia’ may be used when killing is ‘contextually justified’. This\nargument is based on the observation that quality of life is heavily\ndependent not just on the animal’s physical and mental state but the\ncontext in which the animal lives. Assessment of quality of life is based\non predicting what might happen if the animal continues to live.\n[The term] contextually justified euthanasia [applies] where an animal\ncould have a life worth living in an ideal world, but the circum-\nstances mean that the opportunity is not worthwhile. This may be\ndue to an owner’s unreasonableness or the fault of society, but the\nveterinarian should not feel guilty for ‘making the best of a bad job’.\n(Yeates 2010a)\nIn this model, the killing of an aggressive dog could be justified by arguing\nthat such a dog could not be kept in a comfortable environment\nwhich is likely to meet the animal’s needs. For example. the dog may\nneed to be locked up and may not be able to exercise, and may suffer\n3 For many, this is uncontroversial. But if we reason strictly as utilitarians, the\nabove scenario could apply to a human subject if we replace the dog with an\nunruly teenager. But of course few of us are strictly utilitarian. According to\nphilosopher Bernard Rollin, the predominant social ethic represents a\ncombination of utilitarian and deontological theories. ‘On the one hand, social\ndecisions are made and conflicts are resolved by appealing to the greatest good for\nthe greatest number. But in cases wherein maximising the general welfare could\noppress the basic interests constituting the humanness of individuals, general\nwelfare is checked by a deontological theoretical component – namely, respect for\nthe individual human’s nature and the interests flowing therefrom, which, in turn,\nare guaranteed by rights’ (Rollin 2011b). Rollin gives the example of a terrorist\nwho plants a time bomb in a school. The only way to defuse the bomb without\nsetting it off is to obtain information from the offender. But according to our social\nethic, torturing the terrorist to extract that information is wrong – despite the\nenormous costs on a purely utilitarian analysis of the situation. The problem is\nthat while the unruly teenager is afforded rights, the predominant social ethic does\nnot afford animals rights.\nAnimal death\n212\n', 'secondary effects such as anxiety, boredom and distress, compromising\nthe dog’s quality of life to such an extent that euthanasia would be a better\noption.\nYeates distinguishes (a) contextually justified euthanasia from (b)\n‘absolutely justified euthanasia’ (where the only alternative to induced\ndeath is suffering and where further treatment would be considered unethical)\nand (c) ‘killing that is not truly in an animal’s interests’ (such as\nmaking space available for another animal or killing which may be of\ngreat benefit to science).\nThis model acknowledges the reality of killing an animal for reasons\nother than prevention of that animal’s suffering, but it can be\ndifficult to distinguish (a) from (c). For example, one could argue that\nkilling a shelter animal to make room for another is contextually justified\nbecause the animal being killed is one which is unlikely to be\nre-homed, and therefore doomed to a life of confinement, whereas the\nanimal for which room is being made is more likely to be rehomed, and\nattempting to accommodate both animals would lead to overcrowding\nand suffering for all.\nBut could this be simply a guilt-displacement strategy packaged as\nan ethical argument? After all, one may counter that killing one animal\nto make room for another fails to address the greater issue of overpopulation,\nand man-made dependence of domestic animals on humans,\nand simply perpetuates the problem (Palmer 2006).\nAnother deficiency of Yeates’ contextually justified euthanasia\nmodel is that ending a life is not framed as a morally significant behaviour.\nThe danger here is that this obviates the veterinarian of moral\nresponsibility and therefore potentially ethical reasoning. What is there,\nthen, to stop a veterinarian ending the life of any animal on relatively\ntrivial grounds?\nMoral stress and the veterinarian\nVeterinarians are around four times more likely to commit suicide than\nmembers of the general population.4 Attitudes of veterinarians towards\ndeath and euthanasia are considered by numerous authors to be among\nkey factors behind this increased risk of suicide.\n12 Euthanasia and morally justifiable killing\n213\n', 'Bartram and Baldwin cite evidence which suggests an association\nbetween familiarity with death and dying and attitudes to expendability\nof life (Bartram & Baldwin 2010). Similarly, an array of studies cited\nby these authors have demonstrated an association between permissive\nattitudes towards euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide and unassisted\nsuicide, and suicidal thoughts.\nRollin identifies ‘moral stress’ as stress arising from the fact that\npersons such as veterinarians whose life work is aimed at promoting the\nwellbeing of animals are called upon to kill animals, or ‘being complicit\nin creating pain, distress, disease, and other noxious states’ required in\nresearch (Rollin 2011a).\nThis kind of stress grows out of the radical conflict between one’s\nreasons for entering the field of animal work, and what one in fact\nends up doing . . . Imagine the psychological impact of constant demands\nto kill healthy animals for appalling reasons: ‘the dog is too\nold to run with me anymore; we have redecorated, and the dog no\nlonger matches the colour scheme; it is cheaper to get another dog\nwhen I return from vacation than to pay the fees for a boarding kennel,’\nand, most perniciously, ‘I do not wish to spend the money on the\nprocedure you recommend to treat the animal,’ or ‘it is cheaper to get\nanother dog’. (Rollin 2011a)\nRollin rightly points out that the ability of veterinarians to kill animals\nis not only a burden but a blessing:\nWhereas human physicians are not empowered to help horribly suffering\npatients end their pain by providing access to euthanasia,\nveterinarians are fortunately blessed to be able to end suffering by\nproviding a peaceful, painless death. (Rollin, 2011a)\n4 A recent study found that veterinarians have a proportional mortality ratio for\nsuicide approximately four times that of the general population and approximately\ntwice that of persons in other healthcare professions (Bartram & Baldwin 2010).\nThat is consistent with Australian data, with the reported suicide rate for\nveterinarians of 45.2 deaths per 100,000 population in data from Western\nAustralia and Victoria combined – this is 3.9 times the rate in the general\npopulations of these states (Jones-Fairnie et al. 2008).\nAnimal death\n214\n', 'As a veterinarian who performs euthanasia, I am often thanked by\nclients who comment that they wish a close family member with a terminal\nillness or similar condition had died as peacefully as their animal\nhad. Euthanasia, declares Rollin, is a ‘double-edged sword’.\nOne of the major dangers of moral stress generated by euthanasia\nis that it may alter the attitudes of veterinarians to suicide. According to\nthe theory of cognitive dissonance, conflicting thoughts or beliefs may\nlead to psychological discomfort, prompting the modification of existing\nthoughts or the development of new thoughts and beliefs designed\nto reduce inconsistency (and reduce or eliminate tension) (HarmonJones\n& Harmon-Jones 2007).\nConsider, for example, the so-called meat paradox: meat is central\nto the diet of the majority of Australians, yet most of us like animals\nand are disturbed by the prospect of harm being done to them (Bastian\net al. 2012). Meat eating is a morally significant behaviour, but conceiving\nit as such creates dissonance for meat-eaters. The authors showed\nthrough a series of experiments, that dissonance is resolved by many\nmeat-eaters by denying animals minds – as most people are reluctant\nto harm things with minds, but less reluctant to harm things without\nminds.5\nAs the authors state, ‘by denying minds to animals, people bring\ntheir cognitions in line with behaviour commitments, facilitating effective\nand unconflicted action’ (Bastian et al. 2012). The experiments\nsuggest that a range of cognitive and emotional processes obscure\nmoral responsibility for action by reducing the extent to which an action\n(in this case meat eating) is viewed as morally relevant.\nWhen it comes to ending the life of an animal, Bartram and Baldwin\nsuggest that veterinarians may experience ‘uncomfortable tension’\nbetween the desire to preserve life and the inability to treat an animal\neffectively. Depending on the situation, the tension may be between the\n5 The authors base their argument on a series of experiments which show that:\n(a) animals considered for consumption are ascribed diminished mental capacities\nby prospective consumers; (b) meat eaters are motivated to deny minds to animals\nwhen they are asked to consider the link between meat products and animal\nsuffering; and (c) mind-denial is more likely to occur immediately prior to\nconsumption of meat, rather than immediately prior to consumption of a\nnon-animal food product (Bastian et al. 2012).\n12 Euthanasia and morally justifiable killing\n215\n', 'desire to treat the animal and the desire to fulfil the owner’s wishes. For\nsome veterinarians, they argue, this dissonance is overcome by considering\neuthanasia and/or client satisfaction a positive outcome.\nIf we accept this argument, the cost to the veterinarian is high. The\nimpact of moral stress is absorbed by the veterinarian, who experiences\nthe cognitive dissonance and resolves this by modifying his or her\nthinking about an animal’s death: ‘I didn’t have another choice’; ‘if I’d\ntreated it, it might not have recovered anyway’; ‘if I’d not put that litter\nof kittens down she would have dumped them in the creek’ and so on.\nIn the longer term the veterinarian is desensitised toward death\n– specifically, medically or mechanically induced death. Bartram and\nBaldwin argue that from here it is a smaller leap to considering suicide\nas a solution to one’s own problems.\nThis argument is challenged by a recent survey of UK veterinarians\nwhich found that attitudes to animal euthanasia did not correlate with\nacceptance of human euthanasia or suicide (Ogden et al. 2012). The\nfindings cast doubt on whether changes in attitudes to animal life affect\nveterinarian’s attitudes to human life. However, the authors suggest that\nthe dissonance between personal values or ideals and the reality of\n‘convenience euthanasia’ may be a stressor which could lead to suicide.\nThus, where requests for euthanasia of healthy animals are made,\nveterinarians who disagree with the procedure may experience psychological\ndistress (Stark & Dougall 2012).\nAnother major concern is that in lumping all veterinary-effected\ndeaths in the same category, there is less motivation to analyse one’s\nactions, their consequences and potential alternatives. That may negatively\nimpact animals treated in the future. At worst, cognitive disson-\nance around such matters may lead a veterinarian to consider death as\na zero or neutral state. As Yeates argues, this position simplifies endof-life\ndecision-making and may in some circumstances (for example,\nwhere an owner presents a healthy animal for ‘euthanasia’ with poor\ncontextual justification) avoid conflict with the owner: almost any animal\ncan be killed on welfare grounds if an argument could be made\nthat a small amount of suffering would occur otherwise. According to\nthis argument, death – entailing zero suffering – is better than a life\nentailing any level of suffering. This position is consistent with current\nlegislation in the UK, the US and Australia – that is, if consent is given\nAnimal death\n216\n', 'and a humane method of killing employed, ending the life of any animal\n(healthy or sick, young or old) is not illegal.\nIt is an attractive post-hoc position for a veterinarian who feels\ncompelled to kill an animal for reasons they don’t believe are satisfactory.\nBut followed to its logical extreme, this line of thought leads\nto the disturbing conclusion that any killing can be justified as ‘euthanasia’,\nas all life involves some degree of suffering, be it minor dis-\ncomfort or inconvenience, extreme pain or anything on a continuum in\nbetween.6 The use of ‘death-as-a-zero-state’ to resolve cognitive dissonance\nby veterinarians is highly dangerous as it may infiltrate subsequent\ndecision-making processes and lead to situations where ending a life is\nconsidered the simplest and most humane option – and is therefore not\nquestioned.\nAn alternative position holds that death is a welfare state. That is,\nif living leads to overall bad welfare, death is a positive state as it alleviates\nsuffering. Thus, inducing a humane death in such circumstances\nmeets the criteria for euthanasia. If living leads to overall positive welfare,\ndeath is a negative state and inducing the death does not meet\ncriteria to be classed as euthanasia (Yeates 2010a, 2010b).\nWhere to from here?\nVeterinarians are trained to bring about the deaths of animals humanely.\nThey may be called upon to perform this service for a variety of\nreasons, which may or may not be morally justifiable. Veterinarians sit,\noften uncomfortably, between professional obligations as espoused in\nguidelines and broader moral questions. Failure to reflect on this position\nposes risks to animals, veterinarians and their clients (pet owners).\nThe term euthanasia, defined as an act which fulfils the interest of\nthe one who will die and motivated by a moral imperative, applies to\none form of morally justifiable killing of animals, but we need termin6\nOf course an important presupposition of this position is a sharp human/\nanimal distinction, such that while it may be considered logical for any suffering\nanimal to be killed, it is not understood to follow in the case of humans who are\nviewed as morally exceptional.\n12 Euthanasia and morally justifiable killing\n217\n', 'ology that recognises the distinction between these and poorly justified\nor ethically unjustifiable killing of animals.\nThe terminological elision, a symptom of discourses on euthanasia\nwhich are tied to the broader topic of human–animal power relations,\nhas a real impact on animal lives. Part of the problem is no doubt the\nabsence of a palatable alternative term to apply to deaths which do\nnot meet criteria for ‘euthanasia’. The terms ‘termination’, ‘destruction’\nand ‘killing’ fail to encompass the obligation of veterinarians to bring\nabout the death of animals in a humane manner. Terminology which\nfacilitates clear ethical reasoning about end-of-life decision-making is\nimportant not only to ensure that such decisions are made carefully and\ntransparently, but to ensure that the privilege of euthanasia is not abused.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Professor Bernard Rollin, Dr John\nBaguley, Dr May Chin-Oh and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive\nfeedback and valuable suggestions.\nWorks cited\nMerriam-Webster online dictionary [Online].
