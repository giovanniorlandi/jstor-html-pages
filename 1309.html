Now that the war\ni over we have hiked up on spending.\nI he Hoover Commission has issued a\nr* poii that shows Federal, State and local\ni \\.iinn * doubled and trebled in the in\ncome brackets.\nA Cabinet officer, Acheson of the\nState Department apparently, didn’t like\nt>- be exposed and has hastened to accuse\n4i\'ovcr with exceeding the powers of the\nEx-President Hoover is serv-\nQKXhe Government without pay. Congress\n.*VM *he former President to do the job\n•eyt |old him to go the limit.\nThe {daggering increase in the cost of\nI ,iv*rnment—And in taxation—together\nwith the tremendous infiltration of the\nb ederal Government into State and local\nuluir\'i, is spotlighted by the report, which\nbluntly p#MA the question how the Ameri\ncit 11 type of democracy can he maintained\nv,hilcthe Federal bureaucracy provides\n*!t . < rvice which people increasingly de\ni,,.,nd and which are necessary for the gen\neral welfare.\'*\nThese paragraphs may not he easy\nfending, Hut they are easier to read than to\nVftti*.\nTHE AMERICAN WAY-—COMPETITION\nWhile housewives and the public gen\nerally take the state of the nation’s econ\nomy, from day to day, in its stride, yet gov\nernment and private economists are for\never trying to determine the outcome of\ntrends.\nHad economists visited Key West\ngroceries, after their advertisements ap\npeared in The Citizen last week, they\nwould have reached the conclusion that\nprices for commodities generally in this\narea were lower than they had been in\nmany a moon.\nOne reason for lower prices for gro\nceries in Key West is because competition\nin that business is now more acute than\nduring any other time in the history of the\ncity. While the competition is not as\ndecided as it is in Miami, for instance, yet\nit shows a lusty growth in Key West.\nSay what one may, yet there is no\ntruer statement than that oldtime adage,\n“Competition is the life of trade.” It is the\nAmerican way of doing business, the way\nthat has made the United States the out\nstanding business and industrial wonder of\nthe world. As it is inherent in our economy,\nThe Citizen always has opposed the gov\nernment’s meddling in private business,\nother than to see it is conducted fairly and\nhonestly. Keep government out of busi\nness, and the country will continue its\nphenominal progress.\nBut to return to the groceries in Key\nWest. Though freight or express rates are\nhigher on shipments to this community, yet\nthe prices for foodstuffs here compare\nfavorably with those elsewhere in Florida.\nWithout mentioning the name of any\neconomist, the latest view of ‘‘govern\nment and private economists,” outlined in\na newspaper story yesterday, said that the\nrecession in the United States is now\n“checked.” Maybe so, maybe not so, for\ntrends of today not always forecast cor\nrectly what will occur in trade a few days\nor weeks or months from now.\nNature in its wisdom must have had a\nreason for creating the mosquito, hut we\ndon’t know what it could Vie. Perhaps to\ntest the patience of man.\nTORNADO SEASON ARRIVES\nA\nEvery year, about this time, sporadic,\ntornadoes sweep through various sec\ntions of the United States, killing hun\ndreds of people and devastating property.\nThe bouncing tornado, with its rotary\nmotion, is the most destructive force known\nto mankind. Fortunately, in many in\nstances, its approach is announced by the\npeculiar funnel-shaped cloud, which, when\ndetected, gives those in its path an op\nportunity to escape. *\nApparently, tornadoes develop their\npower in somewhat open country, but\nthey often develop terrific force and\nwreak their havoc in comparatively thick\nly-settled areas.\nThe first we have seen reported this\nseason hit communities in five states and\nleft a trail of nearly thirty dead. Those\nwho suffer at the hands of this accidental\nvisitation of nature .receive the sympa\nthetic assistance of their fellow-citizens\nbut this, even on a large scale of generosity,\ncannot make good the full loss or restore\nlife to the dead.\nIn time, perhaps, men will become\nsmart enough to understand and predict\nthe appearance and course of a tornado\nbut, unfortunately, that time is not yet.\nSo far the intelligence of man has de\nvised no way to prevent hurricanes.\nREPORT ONLY THE BEST BRAWLS\nWhat constitutes news?\nWe ask the question after reading\nabout the brawl between a “beauty\nqueen” and her husband, which occurred\nrecently in a New Orleans hotel and got\ncoverage from the news associations.\nThe lady, it seems, was incensed with\nher husband. She waited for him at the\nhotel, in the company of reporters and\nprotographers, who, we presume, are ex\nperts in the business of passing the news\nto the public. When the husband arrived\nthe lady “bit, slapped, scratched and\nkicked” him, much to the satisfaction, no\ndoubt, of the assembled news-hawks.\nIf the press associations are going in\nfor reporting, over the telegraph wires,\nsuch items as worth printing all over the\ncountry, they should pick up the better\nand fiercer brawls which occur in the\nnation by the hundreds every day. Why\nselect the publicity-hunting wife in New\nOrleans who, despite all her anger, didn t\nuse a knife, gun, or hatchet?.\n.

Reports issued by j\nthe Skate of Florida show that\nfor the last fourteen years an av\nerage of more than $1,000,000 has\nbeen realized from the sponge\nindustry. The maximum in value,\nbut not in production was reach- \'\ned in 1948.\n"(ponging Mare Difficult\nWhile there has been no de\ncrease in the demand for sponge\nduring this period, sponge fish- j\ning has become increasingly dif- \'\nficult. The report shows that Flo- j\nrida produced 408,1000 pounds of,\nsheeps wool sponges, yet Sen\nyears later with a sponge fleet ’\n38 per cent larger, it produced!\n162,000 pounds, la 1048 the amt. j\nof sponge brought in far sale]\nby sponge fishermen was\' little,\nmore than half what it been 1\nin 1946. Based on current prices\nthis represents a loss of .$2,000,-\n000 in.a two-year period. * •\nSeveral Factors Responsible\nSeveral factors are responsible\nfor the condition that exists in\nthe industry today. Principal I\namong these is shown to be oyer-1\nfishing. Due consideration was]\ngiven to the fact that heavy j\ndrops occuring 1940-41 were due |\nto a fungus disease that swept\nthe entire area.\nState Board of Conservation\nTakes Action R. j\nIn 1947 the State Board of Con\nservation took action and began\nan investigation of sponge condi\ntions and sponge grounds. The re\nsults of the survey showed that\nsponge beds in, the area investi\ngated had been so damaged by\ndisease and overfishing that they\nwere virtually useless as a source\nof supply. The department then\nsupplied additional funds for a\nsurvey of waters north of Dry\nTortugas and west of Cara belle\nin an attempt to find new sponge\nbeds suitable for commerical pur\nposes.\nHook Spongers Have Views\nOn Matter\nHook spongers in the Key West\narea have their own ideas on\nwhat has killed out sponge pro\nduction on the west coast. Pri\nmary among them is the faci that\ndivers from Tarpon Springs\nsponging in divers’ suits with\nheavy shoes have killed the small\nsponge. They argue, and the ar\ngument seems to have some foun\ndation that the small sponge are\nkilled much as a young plant in\nGo the FASTEST Way\nNEW YORK\nWASHINGTON\n31 Cities in 12 States .\nAlways Buy Round Trig *’•\nSsvs 10% on Rsturn Tickst\nrir wits csartscsct sa *\na garden would be if someone\nstepped on them.

Parked\nbeneath a towering oak tree whose\nleaves were beginning to feel the\ntouch of Autumn, the trailer\nlooked cheery and hospitable. .\nFelicity lifted the slices of ham\nfrom the frying pan to a platter\nand spoke over her shoulder to\na fifteen-year-old boy who sat\'\nhunched over a book at the end\nof the trailer.\n"Round up the gang, Jay dear.\nSupper’s ready," she said cheer\nfully. / *>\n. “Oke,” said Jason, and swung\nhimself down the trailer steps.\nFelicity poured up the red\nigravy in a bowl, added half a cup\nof .hot cofFee to the frying pan to\n"raise” the gravy, and poured it\ninto the bowl. She scooped great\nspoonfuh of hominy-grits into an\nother bowl, brought a pan of hot\nbiscuits from the stove and filled\nfive niugs of milk on the table.\nShe heard the sound of excited\nvoices and the trailer door opened\nto admit Jason, herding before\nhim four children: the eldest,\nCornelia, aged thirteen; the\nyoungest, Ellen, aged seven, with\nthe clamorous ten-year-old twins\nbetween them. There was some\'\nsort of argument going on, and\nFelicity turned to arbitrate it, as\nusual. *\n“I betcha he’s got a million\nbooks, Fliss,” reported Ellen,\nwide-eyed and breathless. “And\nmore magazines— gosh, how I’d\nhkc to cut paper-dolls out ot \'em.\nHe’s good-looking, too."\n“He is nice, Fliss," reported the\nserious, round-faced Cornelia,\nwith an eagerness entirely alien\nto her grave thirteen-year-old\nself.\n, Felicity ushered them all to the\ntable, before she said lightly:\n“It would help if I had some\nidea who—and what—you’re all\ntalking about?”\n•’"I found ’em in a trailer down\nthe line,” Jason reported. “Some\nguy that’s got a bright new trailer\nand a swell car—and he’s got\nenough books to start a second\nhand store, and magazines, too.\nHis name’s Garrett Forbes.”\nFelicity stared at the children\nseverely.\n“Haven’t 1 warned you folks\nthat you mustn’t go around pok\ning your noses into other people’s\ntrailers?” she demanded.\n“He said he was lonesome,"\nCornelia reported gravely. “And\nhe’s nice.
