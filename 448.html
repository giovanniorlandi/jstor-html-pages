China makes great use of globalization and is\ntherefore interested in its continuation. At the same time, it wants to give globalization new features,\nspecific Chinese characteristics. This is met with the reluctance of the current global hegemon, the United\nStates, even more so as fears arise that China may promote abroad its original political and economic\nsystem—Chinism. However, the world is still big enough to accommodate all of our systems. Potentially,\nnot necessarily. What we need to make it happen is a proper policy, which, in the future, must also involve\nits better coordination at a supranational level.\nKEYWORDS transformation, globalization, economic system, Chinism, new pragmatism\nFor some time, opinions have been expressed that a new era is inevitably coming, in\nwhich Asia, especially China, will dominate the world. Not necessarily. However, certainly\nthe relative importance of China—due to the enormity of its still-growing econ-\nomy and population size—will increase. This has obvious not only economic but also\npolitical implications. In an era of irreversible globalization, none of the world’s great\nproblems can be solved without China. It is therefore necessary for other nations not\nonly to compete with China, but also to cooperate creatively. The sooner the culture of\nsuch cooperation develops, and the sooner its supportive institutions are developed, the\nbetter for development of the global economy.\nIn the future, human capital and technology will determine the competitiveness of\nknowledge-based economies. By themselves, however, these economies may not be strong\nenough to promote sustainable development. A political and economic system that favors\nthe formation of capital and its efficient allocation is also indispensable. The Chinese\nsystem is still evolving, so the question arises as to how well it will be able to face the\ngrowing challenges.\nP O P U L A T I O N A N D H U M A N C A P I T A L\nThe time of quantity will never end, but now the time has come for next-generation\nquality—quality of systems, of civilization. Today, and even more so in the future,\nCommunist and Post-Communist Studies, Vol. 53 , Number 4 , pp. 260–279 , ISSN: 0967-067X, e-ISSN: 1873-6920\n© 2020 by the Regents of the University of California.

Since the dawn of time,\neconomy has relied on knowledge, but never has so much depended on knowledge\nresources as it does now. It is knowledge, and the skills in leveraging it in production\nand exchange processes, that will determine which economy is at the leading edge. The\ncompetitiveness of economies increasingly depends on knowledge, and China is fully\naware of it. Accordingly, the country invests an increasing amount of time and funds in\nknowledge and technological progress.\nChinese universities are working their way up global ranking lists, though they are far\nfrom the top positions. Those are occupied nearly entirely by US and British schools\n(only one continental European university is among the top ten: Swiss Federal Institute\nof Technology in Zurich) with MIT, Stanford, and Harvard on the podium—but\nTsinghua University already ranks 16th, and Peking University, 22nd (QS, 2020). In\ntop engineering school rankings, Tsinghua is already right after MIT, and experts say it is\njust a matter of a few years before it becomes a world leader.\nThe results of this rise to the top cannot yet be seen, for example, in the Forbes list\nshowcasing the most valuable brands, where the remote 97th place went to the only\nChinese company on the list—indeed, the most known and significant on the global, not\nonly economic, scene: Huawei (Forbes, 2020). Huawei ranks between Danish Lego\nblocks and US John Deere tractors. Meanwhile, in a much more important ranking,\nhaving specific implications for decisions on investments and purchase orders—namely,\nin the Global Competitiveness Index compiled by the World Economic Forum—China\nranks 28th, after Malaysia and Iceland and before Qatar and Italy (WEF, 2019). At the\ntop of the list are Singapore, the USA, and Hong Kong. Interestingly, in terms of\ncompetitiveness, China is ahead of all other BRICS countries—Brazil, Russia, India, and\nSouth Africa—and most European Union countries.1\nHowever, economy serves people, even if policy sometimes forgets it, and economy\ntreats them selectively. One might be awed by such impressive achievements as the\nmagnificent Pudong skyline in Shanghai or by the 38 ,000 kilometers of high-speed\nrailway, but one also needs to know that public healthcare expenditure represents only\nabout 2% of China’s GDP and that the guaranteed monthly income, dibao, amounts to\na modest RMB 600 , which can buy not much more than a bowl of noodles a day. One\ncan marvel at the architectural perfection of the Zhuhai opera house, whose beauty may\nrival the one in Sydney, but one cannot be indifferent to the fact that on many occasions,\npeasants are removed from their fields through corrupt lawsuits whereby land is taken\nover to build mega housing projects of doubtful allure. One cannot help but admire the\nreach and dynamic growth of the Weibo social media platform and the WeChat megaapp,\neach used by hundreds of millions, but one cannot help but complain that the BBC\n1 . Specifically, in WEF competitiveness ranking, China ranks higher than Italy, Estonia, Czech Republic,\nPortugal, Slovenia, Poland, Malta, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Cyprus, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and\nCroatia, whose 63rd place puts it between the Philippines and Costa Rica (WEF, 2019).\nKolodko | Chinism and the Future of the World 261\n', 'News online service is blocked by the Great Firewall, which is very technologically\nadvanced. Hence, the big picture is very complex.\nWhat will be pivotal for China’s future is to what extent and how quickly changes will\ntake place to satisfy the changing needs of the population. The same is ever increasing in\ncountries working their way up to prosperity and ever smaller in rich countries, which,\nwith exceptions, welcome immigrants. In China, the population will soon cease to grow\nthough it will continue to age (Table 1).\nAccording to UN projections, China’s population will start to decline after 2030 .\nMeanwhile, such a turning point will happen for India a generation later, after 2060 . It is\nsignificant in this context that India—unlike China and other countries with a rapidly\naging population—can leverage its demographic dividend in the form of a relatively\nyoung population, which is a contributing factor for a dynamic economy. While median\nage in the former country is around 28 years, in the latter, it is more than 37 (the global\naverage is 30 years).2 Hence, in this respect, China’s situation is already unfavorable and\nwill continue to deteriorate.\nThe society’s condition and the well-being of the people, especially the financial\ncircumstances of their households and the assessment of individual economic situations,\nare not determined by the size of the economy nor by the nation’s population. That “we\nare the largest country” or “we are more numerous than you” counts for something—\nmore in political than in psychological terms—but welfare and the subjective sense\nthereof is not improving much in China simply due to the fact that the Chinese are\nstill the most numerous in the world3 and that they produce the highest GDP in terms of\nTABLE 1.

The population of China is rapidly aging, which is one more aspect of its economic success. Life expectancy at\nbirth is 77 years for China. For comparison’s sake, in Japan it is eight years longer, 85 years, and in India, eight years\nshorter, 69 years (Macrotrends, 2020).\n3 . The UN estimates that India will become the most populous country in the beginning of the fourth decade of\nthis century. In 2035 , it will have a population of 1 .504 billion, while 1 .464 billion people (UN, 2019) will inhabit\nChina.\n262 CO M M U N I S T A N D P O S T- CO M M U N I S T S T U D I E S D E C E M B E R 2 0 2 0\n', 'purchasing power parity (PPP). Likewise, the fact that, say, Indonesians are seven times as\nnumerous as Poles and that in total they produce almost three times as much is little\ncause for rejoicing for the former if their country’s GDP per capita represents only 42%\nof the same category in the latter, where, for this reason, among others, the average\nlifespan is nearly five years longer. In China, the average lifespan is only two years shorter\nthan in the USA (77 compared to 79 years), and the Chinese enjoy an average income\nthat is rising very fast but still represents only 30% of the American income, which stood\nat USD 64 .700 per capita in 2019 . These are the reasons why one needs to draw on\nmore adequate information than the simple measure of income per capita. Categories\ndescribing the human capital level are highly useful from this perspective (Table 2).\nIn terms of the Human Development Index (HDI), the United States ranks 15th,\nbetween New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and Belgium and Japan,4 and China,\n85th, between North Macedonia and Peru, and Ecuador and Azerbaijan.5 Norway tops\nthe list (HDI of 0 .954), and Niger is at the bottom (HDI 0 .377). Taking account of\nincome distribution inequalities—very high in both the United States and China, with\nthe Gini index of 41 .5 and 38 .6 , respectively—the US goes down 13 spots, to 28th place,\nand China moves up by four, to 81st place,6 so the distance between them is slightly less\nthan in income differences.\nAnother thing that matters is the dynamic of change and the shifts on the world map\nreflecting differences in the level and quality of human capital. In just three decades, since\n1990 , the average HDI for the world as a whole has risen from 0 .598 to 0 .731 , whereas\nin the United States it has gone up from 0 .860 to 0 .920 and in China from 0 .501 to\nTABLE 2.

Hence, 30 years ago, China was below the global average, and now it is already\nabove. While the quality of human capital measured this way has been rising globally by\n0 .72% a year, the pace of its growth in the United States was three times as slow\n(0 .24%) and, in China, twice as fast (1 .48%). Of course, it is easier for a country to\nwork its way up to higher thresholds when it starts from a low level. Now it is getting ever\nmore difficult.\nN O T C A P I T A L I S M A L O N E , C H I N I S M T O O\nBranko Milanović, in his interesting book titled Capitalism, Alone: The Future of the\nSystem That Rules the World, argues that, though following the fall of the Soviet-style\nstate socialism (most often referred to in the literature as communism7) the history by no\nmeans came to an end—capitalism triumphantly and universally took hold over the\nworld (Milanović, 2019). He believes that the future must follow its path, as there is\nno alternative to the victorious capitalism. One could reduce the matter to definitions,\nbut it is much more complicated. In particular, Milanović often puts different categories\nof political and economic systems under the umbrella term “capitalism,” distinguishing\nbetween its two fundamental types: meritocratic liberal capitalism headed by the United\nStates and political capitalism headed by China. Therefore, even though the book title\nspeaks of capitalism alone, in the capitalist reality suggested by the author we would deal\nwith more than just one identity.\nMaybe this is the case, but the problem is that rather than two varieties as part of one\nsystem, we can see a systemic multiplicity. It is not the same case as that of, say, gorilla and\norangutan, two apes belonging to the same family of creatures, but one more similar to\nthat of a monkey and a lemur: very similar on the exterior but different deep down. One\ncan hardly squeeze in such vastly diversified present and future time into one systemic\ncategory, as there are many of them. We still have several worlds, and the point is to\ndecide which of them deserves to be dubbed the first one, where the second one is and\nwhat is going on with the third one, and perhaps with yet a couple others.\nTo solve the dilemma of socialism/communism (yet) or capitalism (already), often\na simple criterion of the share of state and private ownership in the economy is used.\nJanos Kornai (2008), using such a principle, claims that we have had capitalism in China\nsince the turn of the century, because as early as 1998 the private sector was delivering\na larger proportion of national income than the public sector. The capital market has\nbeen gradually developing since the beginning of market reforms. Inter alia, in 1981 ,\ntreasury bonds were offered for the first time; in 1984 , stocks and company bonds were\n7 . In the West, before the turning point of 1989 , the political and economic system dominating the Soviet\nUnion and Central and Eastern Europe was referred to as “communism,” whereas in the part of the world where the\nsystem was spreading, the term “socialism” was used to mean the same. Later, in the period of systemic transition,\nalso in those regions, one would most often hear the term “communism” with reference to the period between 1945\nand 1989 . Therefore, one could sum up saying that it is a matter of terminology, but it is not true as significant\nsubstantive differences and ideological disputes lie behind the ambiguity of the definition (Walicki, 1995; Kolodko,\n2000; Nuti, 2018).\n264 CO M M U N I ST A N D P O S T- CO M M U N I ST S T U D I E S D E C E M B E R 2 0 2 0\n', 'issued and circulated; in 1990 , the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges—now very\nimportant on the global capital market—were initiated.\nState-owned enterprises are particularly visible among the largest companies. These\ninclude companies in which the state has full or majority ownership as well as those in\nwhich, although there is no majority participation, it has a sufficiently large block of\nshares to control the company. In 2018 , the state-owned companies, while owning 88 .2%\nof assets, obtained 84 .2% of revenues of the group of the 100 largest enterprises. Among\nthe ten largest Chinese firms, nine are state-owned—four in the oil and gas sector, four in\nconstruction, and two in manufacturing. The situation is radically different in other\nmajor economies, including Germany and Japan (Table 3).\nWhile the dominance of large state-owned enterprises in China is enormous, in\nGermany and Japan only a few of them appear in the infrastructure sectors (roads,\nrailways, post office). It is also worth noting that, although small, the number of stateowned\ncompanies in the group of 100 giants in China is decreasing—from 87 in 2009\nto 81 in 2018 .\nThere is certainly a need to distinguish between liberal capitalism that evolved in the\nWest over a long historical process, and state capitalism that originated from a shorter\nhistorical process in many post-colonial countries—the erstwhile Third World—and\nsome countries of the post-socialist transition. In the first group of state capitalist\ncountries, a classical example would be an economy such as that of Saudi Arabia or\nEgypt; in the second, an economy such as that of Russia or Belarus.8\nTABLE 3.

Let us leave out of this taxonomy the particular cases that need to be assigned their own unique category.\nCuba should be classified as state socialism, although following recent gradual market-oriented reforms it has\nacquired the characteristics of Chinism. A type of its own is North Korea with its unique Juche system and ideology\n(Lankov, 2013). None of those models will have any followers in the future. On the contrary, these countries’\ngreatest opportunity for growth lies in following the hybrid system of China. As a side note, when I crossed the\nborder between North Korea and “communist” China on the bridge over the Yalu River, I could not resist the\nimpression that I was entering a liberal country where freedom reigns . . . Everything is relative.\nKolodko | Chinism and the Future of the World 265\n', 'China differs in terms of quality and it would be too far-fetched to classify it according\nto that model. This is neither a case of communism, as some scholars would still have it,\nnor of capitalism, even one adorned with this adjective or another (Pei, 2016) but that of\na different quality. It is a political/social/economic system in its own right, which I refer\nto as Chinism (Kolodko, 2018 , 2020a). It is no Beijing consensus laden with statism and\ncentralized bureaucracy, which some attempted to hail for a time as the antithesis for the\nneoliberal Washington consensus (Halper, 2010). Though one can see some analogies\nbetween those concepts, there are definitely more significant differences (Lin, 2013).\nNeither is it a simple period of transition from a centrally planned economy to a market\neconomy, though in the form of state capitalism (Lardy, 2014).\nWhat determines the true nature of the state, society, and economy are the facts.\nHowever, language is also important. In the case of China, in particular, the phrases\napplied in official government documents and in party propaganda are meaningful.\nWhen in 1989 the United University World Institute for Development Economics\nResearch (UNU-WIDER) team of scholars was implementing a research project on\neconomic reforms in socialist countries (Kolodko, 1989), the Chinese researcher’s\napproach caused a lot of controversy. His analysis was based more on the description\nof the evolution of vocabulary used in China to explain systemic changes than on the\ninterpretation of institutional changes and real events and processes (Zhang, 1989).\nIndeed, one can follow the process of systemic transformation through the prism of\nnarrative and the phenomenon of slogans exploited in documents, specialist literature,\nand the media (Alvaro, 2013). Three decades later the narrative about the system and\npolicy, especially economic, is quite different and is still evolving (Karmazin, 2020).\nA serious matter seems to be the wording used in the Party Constitution. It had been\nchanging often, as were the idioms describing the core of the system.9 The versions\nadopted in years 1969 , 1973 , and 1977 (Mao Zedong’s leadership time) stated: “The\nbasic guiding principle of the CCP is to thoroughly overthrow the capitalist class and\nall other exploiting classes, to replace capitalist dictatorship, to defeat capitalism with\nsocialism.” However, in the 1982 document this expression was gone and replaced by\nthe phrase “According to Marx and Engels theory . . . capitalist dictatorship will be\nreplaced by proletariat dictatorship.” Twenty years later, in 2020 , the phrase was\nomitted. The current interpretation, adopted in 2017 , still claims that “MarxismLeninism\nreveals the laws governing the development of the history of human\nsociety,” yet also adds that the CCP uses “Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping\nTheory, the Theory of Three Representations,10 the Scientific Outlook on\n9 . I am grateful to Dr. James Tong for drawing my attention to this issue.\n10 . The theory—Principle—of the Three Representations refers to the main goals of the CCP: increasing\nproduction, including through private entrepreneurship; developing culture, including its promotion around the\nworld; and maintaining political consensus during gradual and prudent democratization of the party, including\nadmission of private businesspersons into its membership. These principles were proposed by Jiang Zemin, a Chinese\nleader in the decade 1993–2003 , and adopted at the CCP Congress in 2002 . At that time they, if not rev-\nolutionary and far-reaching, constituted an interesting attempt to develop and reconcile the thoughts of both Mao\nZedong and Deng Xiaoping.\n266 CO M M U N I S T A N D P O S T- CO M M U N I S T ST U D I E S D E C E M B E R 2 0 2 0\n', 'Development, and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\nfor a New Era as its guides to action” (CCP, 2020).\nFrancis Fukuyama believes that China, since the takeover of power by Xi Jinping’s\nteam in 2012 , has been moving from an authoritarian to a totalitarian system. While this\nis highly debatable, if not wrong, Fukuyama is right that in reality the centralization of\npower and constraining already very limited democracy can be stopped and reversed only\nby internal forces. The more so because “Unfortunately, over the past three and a half\nyears, the United States has been doing everything it can to weaken itself. It has elected\na leader who revels in demonizing his domestic opponents far more than his foreign\nrivals, who has blithely thrown away the moral high ground that used to be the foundation\nof American global power, and who has governed the country with such incom-\npetence during the largest crisis of the past three generations that it is no longer taken\nseriously by either friends or enemies” (Fukuyama, 2020). It is therefore necessary to\nagree with his conclusion, and more precisely with its first part: “Before we can think\nabout changing China, we need to change the United States and try to restore its position\nas a global beacon of liberal democratic values around the world” (Fukuyama, 2020).\nHowever, there is no way to agree with the second part of the conclusions, because as\na result of the failure of neoliberalism and now the fiasco of liberal democracy during the\npresidency of Donald Trump, imagining the future of the United States as a world leader\nin democracy is wishful thinking. This opportunity has been missed. It probably was\nalready gone even several years earlier. At that time, I argued with Zbigniew Brzezinski,\nwho in 2007 wrote about the “second chance” of taking global leadership (the first\nfollowed the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union). That chance\nwas to beat the Republican candidate for the White House. Although this happened\nbecause Barack Obama won, the United States was no longer able to restore its hegemonic\nand leadership position. As I wrote at the time, I think so today: to aspire to global\nleadership, one must take care of the world, not one’s own interests, often at the expense\nof the rest of this world (Kolodko, 2011). Undoubtedly, then and now, the possibility of\nsuch global re-expansion of the United States has been blocked by the rising China. Thus,\nit must not only to be acknowledged, but we have to go further: accept the reality, look\nfor pragmatic compromises, and create a positive synergy, not naı̈vely dream of becoming\na lone superpower.\nChinism, sui generis, is a syncretic economic system based on multiple forms of\nownership of means of production, with a strong macroeconomic policy and limited\ngovernment control with respect to microeconomic management. Deregulation is\nsubordinated to maintaining enterprises’ activities on the course that is in line with\nthe social and political goals set by the ruling party.11 Widely used, flexible but generally\n11 . The Communist Party of China. It would be only right to add “the so called” as for a long time now it has\nbeen communist in name only, not in essence. This designation is a historic legacy of the bygone days. Now the\nruling party advocates implementing and using mechanisms representing the reverse of the communist ideals—for\nexample, private ownership of means of production and capitalist gain, and situations that contradict them such as\nunemployment and major income inequalities.\nKolodko | Chinism and the Future of the World 267\n', 'far-reaching economic interventionism implies both indicative planning addressing the\nbusiness sphere and command planning with respect to some state-owned enterprises and\ninfrastructure. China’s policy for the government, local authorities, and the central bank also\nmakes use of classical instruments of market interventionism. The pricing system is essentially\ndecentralized, which, despite not fully hardened budget constraints with respect to public\nenterprises, guarantees maintaining a dynamic money market equilibrium.\nAt the same time, Chinism has helped eliminate the shortage syndrome and effectively\nkeep price inflation in check (Kolodko, 2020c). This is a feat none of the former state\nsocialism economies—neither the Soviet Union nor any of the CEE economies—was\nable to accomplish, which was the main reason behind their economic and, consequently,\npolitical demise (Kolodko & Rutkowski, 1991; Csaba, 1996).\nSuch a hybrid economic system comes hand in hand with an authoritarian, oneparty\nstate with centralized power essentially based on meritocracy. The policy imple-\nmented by the state is competent and responsible. At the same time, it is oriented to\nfulfilling long-term strategic goals, to which medium-term and immediate goals are\nsubordinated.12 The Chinese authorities use traditional and modern social impact\nmethods; for example, they resort to controlling the society’s compliance with behaviors\npromoted by the general direction of development set by the party and by\nlegislative and executive power. In exerting social influence, such diverse measures are\nused as references to Confucian philosophy and quasi-religion, on the one hand, and\nmodern electronic surveillance invigilation, on the other. Digitization of social communication\nis increasingly used for controlling the public dialogue, inclusive of influ-\nencing the content shared on social media.\nChinism does not stand for turning back from the path of market reforms and\nreturning to the omnipotence of the state sector in the economy (Lardy, 2019); this is\nan overly simplified image of a highly complex reality. The state plays a major role—most\nof all as a regulator and also as the owner of some means of production—but it does not\ncrowd out nor replace the market but rather corrects and supports it and creates a synergy\nwith its forces (Huang, 2017). One should not overestimate isolated events nor hastily\ngeneralize individual observations, but the fact that in 2008 the prestigious post of vice\npresident and chief economist of the World Bank was assigned to an eminent Chinese\neconomist, Justin Yifu Lin, was meaningful. This was not an empty gesture directed at\nChina in recognition of the country’s achievements from those who in fact decided it—\nthe US authorities in consultation with Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and\nFrance. Rather, it was a sign, especially to economically backward countries, that valuable\nconclusions can be drawn from China’s experience in the development policy and that it\n12 . The lifting of the two-term presidential limit in China, so unsettling to the West, is generally seen to herald\nXi Jinping’s continued holding of that office and probably that of the chairman of the party, too, once his second\nterm comes to an end in 2022 . This act can be read as a clear message that the policy line associated with him will be\nfirmly pursued in the long term. The West equates this with a yet greater dose of authoritarianism and further\nrestrictions of what already is a surrogate democracy. When UK Prime Minister Tony Blair or German Chancellor\nAngela Merkel have their term extended beyond two terms, it is democracy, but when the term of China’s leader Xi\nJinping is extended, it is the assault on democracy (even if there is none there).\n268 CO M M U N I S T A N D P O S T- CO M M U N I S T ST U D I E S D E C E M B E R 2 0 2 0\n', 'is worth adopting such good practices elsewhere. Lin’s term of office, 2008–2012 , did\nnot revolutionize Washington’s technocratic way of thinking or the World Bank’s\nactivities, but it undoubtedly contributed to this organization’s further departure from\nneoliberal orthodoxy.\nR E L A T I V E A T T R A C T I V E N E S S O F C H I N I S M\nOutside the Middle Country, the attractiveness of Chinism is limited. Certainly, it will\nnot be transposed to countries of liberal capitalism, but, in turn, it can be—and already\nis—an inspiring offer, or at least an option worth contemplating for many countries of\nthe former Third World. Of course, this is not an option for countries whose naı̈ve\nleaders believe that their strong political power and a large state sector in the economy are\nenough to repeat China’s economic boom. Chinism, deeply rooted in historically embedded\nculture, is much more than that.\nCountries that show certain similarities with the characteristics of Chinism—with all\nindividual caveats—include Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, and Vietnam\nin Southeast Asia; Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in\nCentral Asia; Iran, Oman, and United Arab Emirates in the Middle East; Algeria, Eritrea,\nNamibia, Sudan, and Tanzania in Africa; and Nicaragua in Latin America. In addition,\na number of other countries have some similarities: in particular, on the economic side\na large, centrally controlled state sector, and on the political side, a strong authoritarian\ngovernment. However, these attributes are not sufficient to qualify these countries in the\nsame group as the abovementioned countries.\nSystemic similarities with Chinism do not necessary mean that the adoption of\nparticular features occurred after it happened in China. In certain instances, for example,\nLaos, Myanmar, and Nicaragua, indeed such was the case. In others not so, yet the fact\nthat certain institutions or policies work in China does strengthen the arguments of the\nrulers in favor of using them in their own countries. It does not mean that the leading\npoliticians must explicitly declare that China was the inspiration for their thinking and\nacting. Far from it, because admitting to imitating China in many places would not be\nwelcome. It would not be politically correct; hence the political leaders officially—and\nhypocritically—declare their commitment to democracy, when in fact they are resorting\nto autocratic governance. Following the Chinese specific undemocratic regime is fine, but\nconfessing “We do the same what China is doing” is bad. It is much better to follow the\npattern while maintaining, contrary to the facts, that the nation enjoys a democracy, as\ndo, for example, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.\nOf course, between China’s system and policies, and the relevant features of those\ncountries, there are a number of differences, as they do exist within the same family of\n“free market and liberal democracy” countries. It is sufficient to compare the United\nStates with Latin American states as Mexico or Brazil, Argentina or Chile; or Great\nBritain with East Central European countries as Czech Republic or Croatia, Latvia or\nSlovenia; or Japan with Far East countries as Indonesia or East Timor, the Philippines or\nMalaysia. With the criteria of taxonomy outlined emphatically, they can all be included\nKolodko | Chinism and the Future of the World 269\n', 'in the category of market economies and democratic states, but when we look closer at\ntheir characteristics, there are many differences between them.\nHowever, none of the countries with systems similar to Chinism or inspired by it in\neconomic reforms and development policy corresponds fully with it. While in each of\nthem the market mechanism and government regulation overlap and intertwine, and\nprivate and state ownership coexist in various proportions, in many of them it is difficult\nto see the meritocracy, so symptomatic for Chinism. Everywhere there are authoritarian\ngovernments—mono-party or quasi-multiparty, with elections from time to time, but\nevery time the same party wins—reigning with a large degree of centralization, from\nlimited in Singapore to extreme in Eritrea.\nWhat is particularly interesting is that while some of these countries, like Cambodia,\nare pro-Chinese, certain others, like Singapore, are pro-Western, especially pro-American.\nWhile some, such as Algeria and Nicaragua, are distancing themselves from the West and\napproaching China, others, like Myanmar and Vietnam, are politically distancing themselves\nfrom China and approaching the United States. Indeed, one can have certain\ncharacteristics of Chinism and at the same time be in political opposition to China.\nTherefore, this is a seemingly highly diverse group of countries, but when one looks\ndeeper into their systemic features, one can see many similarities vis-à-vis important\naspects of China’s economy; several indicators of Chinism appear in the economic\nsystems of these countries. Particular attention should be paid to the large share of state\nownership, including monopoly in strategic industries (in this case, “strategic” implies\nmuch more than in Western market economies), central planning, control of the\nexchange rate regime, and the central bank reporting to the government. There are also\ncertain similarities with regard to economic policy methods, especially state intervention\nas a means of industrial and trade policies, protectionism of vital sectors, state subsidies\nfor export-oriented firms, and government influence on major inbound and outbound\nforeign direct investments. In the case of sectors at a higher level of technological\nadvancement, there is often protection and state financial support to increase the international\ncompetitiveness of the companies in these sectors.\nCountries regarded as liberal democracies, in the face of the crisis thereof, must look\nfor ways to protect themselves against the wave of new nationalism (The Economist,\n2016) and the crisis-generating potential of neoliberalism (Galbraith, 2018), but they will\nsurely not follow the Chinese model. This may be done, though to a very diverse extent,\nby emancipating economies and societies, that is, those thrown by neoliberalism into the\ncategory of so-called emerging markets. The important aspect is that two significant\nprocesses overlap at the same time: a huge economic success of Chinism on the one\nhand, and a structural crisis of liberal capitalism on the other.\nCountries that look for a lighthouse, on this chaotic ocean of global economy, can be\nmore quickly reached by the light from Beijing than from Washington, D.C., more\nclearly from the Pearl River Delta and Guangzhou than from the Great Lakes region\nand Chicago. This is also supported by the strong activity of Chinese foreign policy.\nBeijing has more diplomatic posts scattered around the world than the United States\ndoes. Its political impact cannot be underestimated, but at the same time one should not\n270 CO M M U N I S T A N D P O ST- CO M M U N I S T S T U D I E S D E C E M B E R 2 0 2 0\n', 'fear it will be more successful than the West, including the Anglo-American influence,\nwhen it comes to so-called soft power. It is a good thing that in many countries more\nthan a hundred Confucius institutes have been launched, which promote China and\nChinese values. This is not threatening; on the contrary, a bit more of us will understand\nMandarin, which will also contribute to expanding international exchange in the sphere\nof education, science, culture, and sports. The next culminating event in the soft power\nclash will be the 24th Winter Olympic Games in Beijing in 2022 , especially since the\n2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were postponed.\nThis external expansion—irrespective of its strictly economic goals, mainly to export\nmajor surpluses in the infrastructure construction sector, develop outlets for increasingly\ncompetitive industries, and gain access to deposits of raw materials and other resources—is\npursued on a spectacular scale by means of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) (Maçães, 2018),\noften referred to as the new Silk Road. Its principal purpose is not to conquer other countries\nby making them economically dependent—though this, too, can happen in cases of reckless\npolicy in the recipient country, so caution should be exercised—but rather to maintain an\ninternal economic dynamic. For China, despite its enormous size, this cannot be achieved\nwithout having recourse to external factors or without further tapping into globalization for\nquick growth in domestic production and consumption. Over the last couple of decades, no\nnation has leveraged globalization so well for its own growth as China has. And of course it\nwishes to continue to do so. The Chinese are better positioned to leverage globalization as it\nseems that, unlike Westerners who, on their visits to China tell the locals how the world\nshould be organized, the Chinese, while traveling, look for solutions that may prove useful to\nthem as well. China has probably learned more from the West over the last decades than the\nWest has from China—Westerners could learn a lot from the Chinese.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative—and the attendant policy instrumentation and system\ninstitutionalization, as exemplified by the relatively easily accessible loans from stateowned\nEximbank or the establishing of a multinational investment bank, Asian Infra-\nstructure Investment Bank (AIIB)—warrants a broader perspective. BRI is not a threat to\nthe West, nor to Western Europe, considering the part of BRI known as 16þ1 , and\n17þ1\n13 since Greece followed in the footsteps of post-socialist CEE economies in 2019 .14\nThough much hope was pinned on 16þ1 , its first seven years have proved rather lean.\nElsewhere, the swift inflow of Chinese infrastructure and manufacturing investments, and\ntrade cooperation as well as educating medical services and assisting in the expansion of its\nmaterial support, may result in additional development. Let us look at a broader picture: the\nfaster this growth bears fruit, the greater will be the benefits reaped directly in the countries to\n13 . China has put 17 countries in one group for obvious geographic—and, more precisely, geoeconomic and\ngeopolitical reasons—but also taking account of the difference of scale. The sum total of GDPs of those 17 CEE\neconomies represents merely ca. 14% of China’s GDP (ca. 16% at PPP).\n14 . The 16 CEE countries invited by Beijing in 2012 to join BRI are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nBulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland,\nRomania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia. This group does not include Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine. It does not\nfeature Kosovo, either, whose independence China has not recognized to date and neither have Chinese maps as\nthey still show Kosovo as part of Serbia.\nKolodko | Chinism and the Future of the World 271\n', 'which investments and economic aid are addressed. There will also be less pressure to migrate\nfrom poor countries of Asia and Africa to Europe, and a smaller influx of refugees and\neconomic migrants, the waves of which the Europeans find difficult to handle.\nB A T T L E F O R T O M O R R O W , O R T H E I M P E R A T I V E O F I N C L U S I V E G L O B A L I Z A T I O N\nIronically, it is the coronavirus-induced restriction on face-to-face contacts that brings to\nthe fore the strong and unbridled human desire to travel and absorb other cultures, work\ntogether in the field of education and scientific research, and in cultural exchange and sports\ncompetition. We want to be together, not apart. These factors, no less than the classical\nlinks as part of production, supply and sales chains, and global trade, make globalization—\nthe integration of capital and goods markets following liberalization—irreversible. It is even\nmore surprising that calling globalization into question came from the least expected\ndirection. The opinion-leading liberal weekly The Economist came out with the cover title\n“Goodbye globalisation,” advising its readers: “Wave goodbye to the greatest era of globalisation—and\nworry about what is going to take its place” (The Economist, 2020b). While\nelaborating on the pandemic’s devastating consequences for liberalization and the integration\nof the world economy, the weekly at last has understood that the existing form of\nextractive globalization no longer stands a chance. However, The Economist’s doubts that\nthe inclusive globalization can be successful are not justified.\nIt is true that the COVID-19 pandemic—with its psychological and political side effects\nsuch as growing xenophobia and mutual hostility—is highlighting the symptoms of protectionism\nand naı̈ve mercantilism that were felt before. The neoliberalism-induced finan-\ncial and economic crisis of 2008 led to a wave of new nationalism. For neoliberalism,\nintended to help a very few people get rich at the expense of the majority, the public enemy\nwas the government as the regulator and income redistribution policy maker, whereas for\npopulism and new nationalism, this role is reserved for globalization. This clash both\nweakens the capacity—already an impaired one—to focus policymaking on a multinational\nscale, and it is conducive to throwing political, social, and economic relations into anarchy.\nAdding to the crisis of mishandled economy liberalization—it being improperly deregulated\nfrom the point of view of social cohesion and economic equilibrium—is the\ncrisis of liberal democracy.15 There are those who believe that liberalism has already\ncollapsed (Deneen, 2018). This crisis is taking different, sometimes surprising forms—\none in the United States following the election of President Donald Trump in 2016 ;\nanother one in Poland ruled by the Law and Justice party; yet another one in Australia\nwith its nationalist government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison; and a different one in\nBrazil with the populist right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro. In every case, the crisis of\n15 . Some authors, wrongly not distinguishing between neoliberalism and liberal democracy, advocate the view\nabout the fall of the latter in Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, illiberalism, or illiberal democracy, is emerging in\nsome countries of the region—especially in Hungary and Poland—as a result of the failure of neoliberalism (Krastev\n& Holmes, 2019). The action causes a reaction; it is not the aversion to liberal democracy that stimulates populism\nand nationalism, and ultimately illiberalism, but rather the defeat of neoliberalism.\n272 CO M M U N I S T A N D P O S T- CO M M U N I S T S T U D I E S D E C E M B E R 2 0 2 0\n', 'liberal democracy harms the supranational social cohesion and makes it difficult for\nglobalization to stay on a reasonable course.\nThis course must be based on non-orthodox economic thought, particularly new\nstructural economics (Lin, 2012), economics for the common good (Tirole, 2017), and\nnew pragmatism—a sort of interface between descriptive and prescriptive economics\nindicating the ways to integrate economic, social, and environmental development into\nan economy of moderation (Kolodko, 2014). Economists of various contemporary\ntheoretical schools (Galbraith, 2014; Phelps, 2013; Rodrik, 2015; Stiglitz, 2019) voice\nthe conviction that it is possible to create a good economy.\nChina—the greatest beneficiary of globalization—fully grasps that, which is why\n(though, above all, because it has its own interests at heart), it is globalization’s great\nadvocate. Chinese leaders repeat the phrase win-win ad nauseam, emphasizing that\nglobalization must be advantageous for all parties involved. It is right, though some astute\nobservers are sneering that behind this win-win lies a desire for a 2:0 win . . . To save\nglobalization, to make it truly irreversible, it must become inclusive. Letting it continue in\nits neoliberal way—preferred by special interest groups and selfish economic and political\nlobbies, coinciding with adverse megatrends in the natural environment, global warming,\nuncontrollable large migrations, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to what\nI call a Yet Greater Crisis, YGC (Kolodko, 2011 , 2020b)—is not an option.\nNeither an inclusive globalization, nor any kind of globalization whatsoever, can be\ncontinued without the necessary degree of harmony between the world’s two largest\neconomies—those of China and the United States (Kissinger, 2011). When it already\nseemed that we were on the right track in this respect—especially thanks to the efforts of\nPresident Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping, yielding a number of bilateral and\nmultilateral agreements of global implications, as exemplified by the fundamental 2015\nParis Agreement on climate change mitigation—there came President Donald Trump,\na fierce opponent of globalization who fails to understand its essence. The hope for\ndevelopment of pro publico mundiale bono cooperation and friendly rivalry as part of the\nso-called G-2—or Chimerica—was replaced with Cold War 2 .0 . In the heat of the\npandemic psychosis, in both Washington, D.C., and Beijing there is talk of a possible\n“hot war” that may be provoked by a Taiwan crisis. When US hawks made allegations\nthat China is preparing to join the island to the motherland by force—which needs to be\nprevented through military measures, even if it means unleashing a war—Chinese analysts\nfrom a military think tank speculated that it is Americans who are instigating\nradicals in Taipei to declare independence (The Economist, 2020a). The reason it is\ndangerous is that, in addition to Donald Trump’s extreme Sinophobia, Republicans’\nDemocratic Party opponents are somewhat Sinophobic themselves. It will take some\ntime before better, pragmatism-driven relations can be reestablished . . .\nAn interesting perspective that systematizes the analyses and provides a methodology\nto facilitate the discussion of China’s foreign relations is suggested by Kerry Brown. In his\ninspiring book China’s World: What Does China Want?, he divides China’s global\nsurrounding into four zones. The first one is the United States; the second, the rest of\nAsia (including Russia); the third, the European Union; and the fourth, other countries\nKolodko | Chinism and the Future of the World 273\n', 'of the world (Brown, 2017). China-US relations are paramount for the functioning of\nthe global economy and politics—with or without globalization. Another thing of strategic\nimportance is the behavior of the European Union, which President Trump would\nlike to win over to his side in the US-China face-off. Trump is failing at that, and one\nshould hope that nobody will succeed in turning the EU and China against each other as\nthat would harm them both and the whole global economy as well.\nHard times call for prudence and calm rather than thoughtlessness and overexcitement.\nSome Western politicians, failing to comprehend the objective imperative of pragmatic\ncoexistence with China, have radically turned their backs to it. This can be felt much\nstronger in the United States than in the EU. Now, in the face of their own powerlessness,\nthey are losing common sense. While in politics one cannot entirely avoid lunatics and fools\nwho need to be restrained and eliminated from public life, some statements by top-echelon\npoliticians and influential government advisers are very alarming. These are people from\nwhom we expect expertise and responsibility, and if they are guided by cynicism, so common\nin politics, this should be exposed and opposed in a debate.\nWhen Peter Navarro, an economic adviser to whom President Trump lends an ear,\nsays that China “inflicted tremendous damage. . . .We’re up to close to $10 trillion we’ve\nhad to appropriate to fight this battle. . . . A bill has to come due for China . . . it’s\na question of holding China accountable, the Chinese Communist Party accountable,”\nit is already dangerous for the maintenance of correct mutual economic and political\nrelations. Maybe it would be more legitimate for China to claim from the West, especially\nfrom the British, a compensation for giant losses caused knowingly by the intentionally\nwaged Opium Wars in the mid-19th century where the half-colonized Chinese population\nwas subjected to planned debilitation by being forced to buy poison cultivated by\npoor peasants in fully colonized India. Let us just wait for somebody to come up with\nsuch a demand . . . Maybe Central and Eastern Europe will demand to be paid back for\nthe losses brought on by the Washington-championed “Consensus” at the time of postsocialist\ntransition? In addition, the countries of Western Africa may demand retribution\nfor the irreparable damage sustained in the past as a result of devastating slavery, which\nwas, in turn, one of the forms of original accumulation of wealth in North America.\nAmericans’ present-day wealth is also built on the blood and sweat of millions of African\nslaves, which some wish to easily forget but others should never forgive.\nWhen a technocrat of Margrethe Vestager’s class—seemingly one of the most competent\nEuropean Commissioners—warns against the threat of takeover of European\ncompanies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, this is cause for concern. If a Chinese\ninvestor knocks on the door of entrepreneurs who are not coping well with the crisis,\neven with generous public aid from governments and the European Commission, one\nneeds to negotiate with him and strike a deal rather than refuse to consider his offer. Even\nif the Chinese take full control of some companies and penetrate, to a wider extent,\nindustries of interest to them, this will be an inflow of fresh capital that is in short supply\namid the crisis. This will often involve a transfer of high technologies, which are increasingly\nabundant in China, and access on an ever-larger scale to the Chinese market and to\nthird markets. Actually, many of such investments will be oriented to production for\n274 CO M M U N I S T A N D P O ST- CO M M U N I S T S T U D I E S D E C E M B E R 2 0 2 0\n', 'exports. When Danish or German capital flows into Slovakia or Poland, these are\ndesirable direct foreign investments, and when Chinese capital flows into Spain or\nSweden, this is a “takeover of European firms”?\nA harmonized global order requires a strong and united European integration\n(Shambaugh, 2016), but, unfortunately, it is being weakened due to the financial and\nmigration crisis and the growing wave of new nationalism and devolutionary tendencies.\nBrexit is further undermining the EU, reducing its economy by approximately\n15%. Unfortunately, the European Union is becoming weaker at the time when it\nshould gain strength to counterbalance China’s growing influence. At the same time,\nthe EU is China’s leading cooperation partner and strategic rival; this is no contradiction\nbut a sort of dialectic.\nAgainst such a backdrop, one should add another complication to this already\ncomplex equation: the triangle formed by China–Russia–the EU, notably Germany.\nThe latter wants a strong, more deeply integrated European Union. It also wants good,\npragmatic relations with both Russia and China. Today, such Russian-German relations\nare not being sought by a Kaiser and a tsar, but rather by a chancellor and\na president who speak its language. To both, China is a vast market outlet; to Germany,\nfor high-tech industrial products, to Russia, for raw materials, of which its land\nsprawling over eleven time zones has greater underground deposits than any other\ncountry. Geopolitical games played between those three have a major impact on the\ngeoeconomic situation.\nChina cares about developing cooperation with other countries and regions, at the\nsame time engaging them further in the globalization process. While the United States\nhas more than 200 military installations abroad in 120 countries, China has one—\na small naval base in the Horn of Africa, in Djibouti—but, in contrast, it is the largest\ntrade partner for 130 countries. The sheer size of its economy makes it necessary to\ninstitutionalize foreign policy in the form of multilateral contacts. China must reach\nagreements at the bilateral level with countries like India and Russia but not with\nTanzania and Argentina. This is why numerous forums have been created for communication\nand discussion, and sometimes for engaging in joint projects. Contacts with\nAfrica are dealt with as part of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), of\nwhich all of the continent’s countries are members except Eswatini, the only country in\nAfrica to still officially recognize Taiwan. To foster cooperation with South America,\nthe Forum of China and Economic Community of Latin American and Caribbean\nStates (Foro China-CELAC)16 was established. Two other organizations intended to\nstrengthen contacts with immediate neighbors are the China-South Asia Cooperation\nForum (CSACF) and the China-Central Asia Cooperation Forum (CCACF). There\nare other such institutions as well, because China does not lose sight of any world\nregion—including Oceania, the Arctic, and the Antarctic. The functioning of those\n16 . The Forum does not include the region’s countries, which maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan:\nBelize, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia.\nKolodko | Chinism and the Future of the World 275\n', 'structures certainly brings multilateral benefits, and adds the “Chinese characteristics”\nto globalization.\nCarrying out numerous projects requires finance. If their own funds are not enough,\nemancipating economies resort to foreign loans. China once used them, too, but at\nsome point it became a lender, especially for developing economies, and it is now the\nlargest creditor in the world. Loans granted by China, nearly none in 2000 , in 2020\nexceed the sum total of loans extended by the World Bank and the International\nMonetary Fund. At nearly 400 billion US dollars, the loans are twice as high as the\nofficial public debt of developing economies to the Paris Club countries. These\namounts and relations between them are changing due to the pandemic-induced crisis\nbecause, on the one hand, both rich countries and China write off some of the\nirrecoverable debts of the so called highly-indebted poor countries (HIPC),17 and,\non the other, they extend new loans to those in need. The ongoing shifts in that area\nwill strengthen China’s position, especially because the White House’s irresponsible\npolicy discourages it from financing the US public debt. Part of the surplus that could\nhave been placed in US bonds will be invested in securities of emancipating economies.\nIn the long run, it is a favorable structural change as it will boost the development of\ncountries that lag behind, while—perhaps—partly motivating the US to crack down on\nliving beyond its means, which is financed with continuous borrowing.\nSome authors believe that in the coming decades the main—not only economic—\nclash will be in the field of artificial intelligence (AI; Lee, 2018). In recent years, China\nhas made enormous headway in this area, using scientific and technological breakthroughs\nin electronic engineering and digitization, as well as its unique position of\nhaving abundant Big Data. The bigger an active population is, the larger the amount of\ndata that helps build AI applications. In this specific respect, only India can rival China.\nMeanwhile, the latter still has a lot to learn, and needs to create a more open system of\ninnovation (Medvedev, Piatkowski & Yusuf, 2020).\nConsidering the whole context—including the hardware and software quality, and\nespecially highly qualified professionals—the main competitive clash will, again, pit the\nUnited States against China. The ensuing economic tensions will become politicized,\nwhich can already be felt. It is beyond question that one of the reasons for the trade war\nand the new cold war initiated by Americans is this very fear of losing AI supremacy.\nWe are faced with a choice between (1) a rivalry that upsets the equilibrium and\ndynamic and (2) cooperation and looking for synergies. So far, none of the parties\nseems willing to choose the latter.\nSince globalization can no longer be stopped—what is linked with the development and\nexpansion of China—there will be a continuing debate on what is good and bad for the\n17 . The World Bank classifies 39 economies as HIPC, as many as 33 of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa: Benin,\nBurkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,\nGuinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Comoros, the Congo, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania,\nMozambique, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Central African Republic, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo,\nUganda, São Tomé and Prı́ncipe and Zambia; one in Asia, Afghanistan; and five in South and Central America and\nin the Caribbean—Bolivia, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua (World Bank, 2020).\n276 CO M M U N I ST A N D P O S T- CO M M U N I S T S T U D I E S D E C E M B E R 2 0 2 0\n', 'world. Yes, there are good and bad economies (Sedlacek, 2011), there are systems that are\nmore and less effective in terms of meeting their objectives, there are progressive and\nbackward ideologies and political systems that follow them. It is all the more important\nto learn as much as possible from one another and draw on the experience of other\ncountries’ systems and policies in a creative way. Bad examples are also useful—if only to\nknow what not to do. China has learned a lot from other countries, from their experience,\nfailures, and successes, while showing a unique capacity for approaching its problems from\na pragmatic standpoint rather than an ideological one—the way it used to do. Nevertheless,\nit still has a lot to learn. One should hope that it will be willing and able to do so.\nThe British historian Ian Morris suggested one of the most interesting comparative\nanalyses of history. He developed an original Social Development Index, which takes\nparticular account of the energy capture, a given social culture’s capacity for organization,\nmeasured with the size of its largest urban areas, war-making capacity, and the\nadvancement of information technology, determined by the speed and extent of the\nspread of the written word and telecommunications (Morris, 2010). Using those\nmetrics, he reaches the conclusion that the West will keep dominating the world only\nfor a couple more generations after which, in the first decade of the 22nd century, the\nworld will be dominated by the East, the most important part being, of course, the\nMiddle Country—China.
