MISSISSIPPI. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 28. 1916\nNo. 1.\nWARNING and FINAL NOTICE\nOn and after the 1st of January 1917 all accounts made with us will be payable on the 1st of each month. After Jannary 15th 1917\nwe will positively decline to extend further credit or make any charges to any one not having paid up their 1916 or previous accounts\nwith us.

Beal, plant patholo-\n. gist of the Mississippi A. and M.\nCollege Experiment Station, re-\ncently made this statement and\nis suggesting that all oats ta . be\nused for seed, unless known to\nbe free from smut, be treated\nwith a solution of formalin to\nkill the smut spores before they\nare put into the ground.\n1 The importance of this treat\nl ment is shown by the fact that\n\' practically the only way that oat\nsmut may live over from year to\n( year is on the grain. arid when\nthe seed is planted in the spring\nthe spore is planted with it,\nboth germinate at the same\ni time, and by the time the green\nI; sprout comes out of the ground\n! the smut has a strangle hold on\n; rtt.

Are you getting\nany of the money from this high\npriced butterfat or have you let\nall your cows gd dry by iot feed\ning them properly?. If you have\nkept them giving a reasonably\ngood flow of milk yon should\ngive them all the good bright\nyour herd.

William X\nBryan, who startled the country ten\nyears ago by advocating government\nownership of railroads, appeared be\nfore the Newlands Joint Committee on\nInterstate Commerce last week In sup\nport of the claim that the states should\nbe allowed to retain authority over the\nregulation of all tjransportation lines\nwithin their powers. Air. uryan\nplained that he bad long regarded gov\nernment ownership as Inevitable, but\nonly because of railroad opposition to\neffective regulation.\nAgainst Government Ownership.\n"Personally I cannot say that I de\nsire government ownerahlp," he ex\nplained, "because I lean to the indi\nvidual Idea rather than to the couec\ntlve Idea: that Is, I believe that gov\nernment ownership is desirable only\nwhere competition Is Impossible."\nAlfred P. Thorn, counsel to the Hall\nway Executives Advisory Committee,\npreviously had presented before the\nmembers of the Newlanas uommiuee\nas one of his reasons for urging a bet\nter balanced and more systematic reg\nulatlon of railroads the argument that\nthis is the only alternative to govern\nment ownership. Calling attention to\nthe restrictions imposed upon the\ntransportation lines by conflicting state\nlaws and regulations, to the practical\ncessation of new construction and to the\nimpossibility under existing conditions\nof securing the new capital needed for\nextensions and betterments of railway\nfacilities, he warned the Congressmen\nthat unless they provided a fair and\nreasonable system of regulation that\nwould enable the railroads to meet the\ngrowing needs of the country\'s busi\nness the national government would\nbe compelled to take over the owner\nship of the lines with all the evils at\ntendant upon such a system. ,\nPreservation of Competition,\nMr. Bryan, on the other hand, holds\nthat the further extension of federal\nauthority over the railroads would be\na step in the direction of government\nownership. He advanced the view that\nthe centralization of control in the\nhands of the national government\nwould impose too great a burden upon\nthe regulating body, would offer strong\ntemptation to railroads to interfere iu\npolitics and would encourage the gen\neral movement toward centralization\nof power in the federal government at\nthe expense of the states. He said that\nhe did not object to consolidations of\nrailroad lines so long as they did not\ndestrov competition, that he knew of\nno complaint against great railway\nsvstems because of their size and that\nhe believed that the preservation of\ncompetition was the test to be applied\nto all consolidations.\nRegulation of Securities. .\nMr. Bryan declared himself in favor\nof national regulation of railway stock\nand bond issues, but added that he saw\nno reason why that should exclude the\nstates from acting on the same sud\nject as to state corporations. "I would\nlike to see the stock of a railroad, as\nlong as it is in private hands, made as\nsubstantial and as unvarying as the\nvalue of a government bond," he as\nserted. He suggested that railroad capitali\nzation be readjusted to equalize it with\nactual valuation of the property rep\nresented, making due allowance for\nequities, and that when this was done\nthe roads should be allowed to earn\nsufficient Income to keep their stock\nat par and to create a surplus. The\nlatter, he tentatively proposed, might\nbe allowed to amount to 2S per cent\nof the capital.\nRailway Earnings Low.\nThis subject of railroad capitalization\nand the amount of railroad earnings\nkpoIvmI further attention from the\ncommittee during its recent sessions,\nIn answer to questions by Senator\nCummins, Mr. Thom submitted figures\nshowing the net earnings of the roads\nin recent years. These figures, show\nthat during the five years from 1905\nto 1910 the average net earnings were\n5.25 Der cent of the net capitalization.\nwhile for the five years from 1910 to\n1915 the average was only 4.56 per\ncent The total earnings on the stock,\ncom mi ted by adding to the net oper\nating Income the Income from the se\ncurities owned and deducting bona in\nterest were for. 1910.

The Congres\nsional Joint Committee on Interstate\nCommerce, which has been conducting\nthe inquiry into government regulation\nand control of transportation, last\nweek decided to suspend its hearings\non the subject and adjourned, subject\nto the call of the chairman, because of\nthe pressure of other .work before Con\ngress. According to the resolution ere\na ting the committee, it is required to\nsubmit a report by January 8th next\nIt is understood that before that time\nthe committee will ask for en exten\nslon of time and that the hearings will\nbe resumed at s later date, when some\nof those who already have appeared\nbefore the committee will be question\ned further and a great many others\nwill be beard. It Is probable, howev\ner. that the hearings will not be resum\ned until after adjournment of Congress\non March 4th. In addition to regular\nroutine business the commerce com\nmittees of the two houses are charged\nwith the Important duty of preparing\nand presenting the legislation asked\nfor bv President Wilson to maxe lm\nnossible a railroad strike without pre\nvious Investigation. This will leave\nlittle or no time for the consideration\nof the general questions of railway\nregulation.\nCountry Wants Something Done.\nMembers of Congress and others\nwho are interested in the inquiry un\ndertaken by the Newlands Committee\ninsist that there is no intention or\nabandoning it.\nIt seems doubtful, inaeea, n tne\ncountry would permit the matter to\nbe dropped if there were evidence of a\ndesire on the part of Congress to do\nso. The nation-wide evidences of in\nterest evoked by the initiation of tne\nNewlands inquiry show that the peo\nple" of the country shippers, consum\ners and Investors, as well as railway\nmen themselves are alive to tne raci\nthat, the railway situation is highly un\nsatisfactory and that steps must be\ntaken without unnecessary dqlay to\nmake it possible for the railroads to\nmeet the growing needs ot tne nation\nFrom reports received here it seems\nas though almost every commercial or\nganization and business interest in the\ncountry were engaged in studying the\naUrnnd miestion. The Chamber of\nCommerce of the United States has\nbeen conducting an elaborate inquiry\ninto various phases of the subject for\nmany months past Many local and\nstate commercial bodies in every part\nof the country have committees en\ncased in study of the problem and\nhave indicated a des?re to come here\nand oresent their views. National or\nganizations of manufacturers, lumber\nmen, coal operators, wholesale and re\ntail dealers, have expressed through\nresolutions their desire for the unifica\ntion of the system of railway regnla\ntion. The National Industrial Traffic\nLeague, speaking from the viewpoint\nof shippers using . the railways, has\nindorsed exclusive federal regulation\nproviding it is accomplished in such a\nway as to give full protection and\nprompt adjustment in matters relating\nto transportation within the states.\nMany Interests Studying Problem.\nAll these organizations represent pri\nmarily the shippers of the country, but\nthey are not the only ones who are\ntaking a hand in the discussion. The\nInvestors of the nation, through their\nown associations and through commit\ntees representing the savings banks and\nother financial organizations, are pre\nparing to show the necessity of improv\ning railroad credit and protecting the\nrights of those whose money is invest\ned In railway securities. Finally the\nrailroads themselves, being vitally con\ncerned In the Improvement of existing\nconditions, are planning to submit their\nviews through their executives, oper\nating officials and traffic experts and\nto assert their willingness to accept far-\nreaching federal regulation along lines\nthat will enable them to attract capital\nand to provide the facilities needed for\nthe prompt and , efficient handling of\nthe country\'s transportation businesa\n\' Main Trouble la Tee Many Masters.\nNot all of these interests are in ac\ncord as to the remedies that should be\nadopted. There seems to be a general\nagreement, however, that many of the\ndifficulties which confront the railroads\nand which make It Impossible for them\nto meet the requirements of the na\ntloa\'s commerce promptly and satisfac\ntorily arise from the haphazard and\noften conflicting measures of regulation\nthat have been adopted from time to\n, time by the federal government and the\nforty-eight states ana mat wnai\nneeded is a well ordered, systematic\ncheme of federal regulation that shall\ncover the whole country and make It\npossible for the railroads to provide the\nextensions and improved facilities so\nbadly needed, while at the same time\ntrotecttnr fully tne public interests.\nPEACE CONDITIONS OUTLINED.\nThe proposals of Germany for\nlasting peace follow:\nFor the complete restoration of\nBelgium.\nFor the evacuation by Germany\nof all territory captured In North\nern France during the progress of\nthe wsr.\nFor the establishment of Poland\nand Lithuania as independent\nkingdoms.\nFor the retention of 8ervla by\nAustria-Hungary and the restora\ntion to Bulgaria of all territory\nlost by that country In the second\nBalkan war.\nFor the restoration to Austria\nof territory captured by Italy In\nthe neighborhood of the Adriatic\nSea.\nFor the restoration to Germany\nof all her colonial possessons In\nAfrica, the far east and other parts\nof the globe.\nFor the retention of Constanti\nnople by Turkey.\nCOMMISSIONER\'S SALE\nMilton A.

For the ac\ncommodation of those interested\nProf. T. J. Brooks, Rural\nEconomist of the Mississippi A.\nand M. College has just issued\nthe following statement explana\ntory of this system.\n"The Torrens system of guar\nanteeing land titles which has\nbeen adopted by twelve states,\nincluding Mississippi, and by\nmany foreign countries, is now\nreceiving particular attention, as\nthe Federal Farm Loan Board\nwill accept farms registered\nunder this act without question\nas to title. Otherwise the title\nto each tract of land that is\npledged for a. loan under the\nrural credit law has to be in\nvestigated by a special attorney\nappointed by the Land Loan\nBank, and the expense charged\nup to the borrower. When land\nis once registered each subse\nquent transfer costs only fifty\ncents and there is no question\nraised as to the validity of the\ntitle.\nRequirements of the Owner\n"Any farmer who desires land\nunder this act must present to\nthe chancery court a petition\nsigned and sworn to setting out\na full description of the land,\nwith a plot of the same by meets\nand bounds; corners to be mark\ned by iron, stone or cement\nmarkers. He must show when",\nhow, and from whom it was ob\ntained, by whom occupied, and\ngive account of all liens, inter\nests, equities and claims vested\nin or contingent upon this land,\nas well as the full name and ad\ndress of all parties who may be\ninterested by marriage or other\nwise, including adjoining owners\nand occupants. If the meets and\nbounds are not known the chan\ncery clerk may order a survey.\nThe date of proposed registration\nmust be published in a county\npaper, citing all claimants to\ncourt.\nCost of Registering Land\n"It costs almost as much to\nregister a small farm as it does a\nlarge one as some of the items of\nexpense are the same regardless\nof the value of the farm. In all\nthere are seven "possible items of\nexpense, as follows:\n1. Chancery clerk fee for\ncopying plot\nFor issuing certificate\n2. State assurance fee (col\nlected by the chancery\nclerk), one tenth of one\npercent of the assessed\nvalue of the land. On\na farm worth $5,000,\nthis would be\n3.

Attorney\'s fee in chan\ncery at time of hearing\nbefore the court estima\nted on the basis of no \'\nclaimants 10.00\n6. Possible fees for sheriff\nand clerks in case of\nsuit . \'\n7.
