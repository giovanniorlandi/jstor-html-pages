        <pre>['Establishing state liability for \npersonal liberty violations arising \nfrom arrest, detention and malicious \nprosecution in Lesotho \nChuks Okpaluba*\nAdjunct Professor, Nelson Mandela School of Law, University of Fort Hare, \nSouth Africa\nSummary \nThis article seeks to analyse the case law relating to infringements of the\npersonal liberty rights of the individual through the traditional common\nlaw actions for damages for wrongful arrest, unlawful detention and\nmalicious prosecution. These rights are often violated by the police – the\nprincipal law enforcement agents of government. Sometimes, too, nonlaw\nenforcement personnel of the Lesotho army unwittingly get embroiled\nin law enforcement duties, thereby involving the government in incurring\nliability in damages for the numerous human rights violations that trail\ntheir encounter with members of the public. Although there are provisions\nin the Constitution of Lesotho of 1993 through which the individual may\nventilate his or her entrenched fundamental rights, victims of these\nbreaches tend to enforce their security of the person and human dignity\nrights in the courts in Lesotho by way of the common law damages in\ndelict. In an attempt to establish the liability of the state in this instance,\none witnesses the interplay of the constitutional guarantee of rights, the\nprotections afforded the individual through the Criminal Procedure and\nEvidence Act of 1981 and the common law cause of action. The present\ninvestigation concentrates on the primary problem of establishing the\nliability of the state first and foremost, as an assessment of the quantum\nof the damages recoverable is an exercise a court can undertake only after\nthe liability issue has been resolved or ascertained. This contribution,\ntherefore, examines the many instances whereby, in the purported\nperformance of law enforcement duties of the state, the police and army\npersonnel have infringed the rights of the citizens and, in the process,\nAFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\n* LLB LLM (London) PhD (West Indies); okpaluba@mweb.co.za\n To cite: C Okpaluba ‘Establishing state liability for personal liberty violations arising from arrest, \ndetention and malicious prosecution in Lesotho’ (2017) 17 \nAfrican Human Rights Law Journal 134-162\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17159/1996-2096/2017/v17n1a7\n', 'STATE LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS IN LESOTHO                                                135\nexpose the brutal nature of the injuries the victims have suffered and the\nrole the courts have played in their endeavour to uphold the rights to\nsecurity of the person and human dignity as well as to maintain the rule of\nlaw in Lesotho.\nKey words: personal liberty rights; human dignity; wrongful arrest;\nmalicious prosecution; unlawful detention; state liability for police\nbrutality; military involvement in law enforcement duties; disregard for the\nrule of law\n1 Introduction \nA perusal of the fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution of\nLesotho of 19931 reveals that there are at least three constitutional\nroutes through which a person unlawfully arrested or detained can\nventilate such an infringement. To begin, any person who is\nunlawfully arrested or detained can claim compensation in terms of\nsection 6(6) which guarantees the individual the right to personal\nliberty.2 Besides section 6(6), there is the general right of access to the\ncourts to enforce a breach or threatened infringement of any of the\nrights entrenched in Chapter II of the Constitution embedded in\nsection 22. The complainant is entitled, by virtue of this guarantee, to\napply to the High Court for redress.3 In turn, the High Court is vested\nwith the jurisdiction to enforce the right allegedly infringed or\nthreatened with infringement and, in the process, it is empowered to\nmake such order, issue such process and give such directions as it\nconsiders appropriate in the circumstances.4 In this regard the court is\nempowered to make a declaratory judgment which states the rights of\nthe applicant, or issues other forms of interdicts (mandatory or\nprohibitive) when approached to do so.5 The courts in\nCommonwealth jurisdictions where similar constitutional provisions\nexist have interpreted this clause to entitle the applicant to the award\nof damages for breaches of the guaranteed fundamental rights in\nappropriate cases.6 \nApart from the ‘compensation’ and ‘constitutional damages’ routes,\nthere is yet a third source derived from the reading together of\n1 Constitution of Lesotho or Constitution. \n2 Compare sec 3(6) 1966 of the Constitution of Lesotho.\n3 Sec 22(1) 1993 Constitution of Lesotho.\n4 Sec 22(2) Constitution of Lesotho.\n5 C Okpaluba ‘Redress for breach of fundamental rights in Nigeria’ (1981) 23\nJournal of the Indian Law Institute 205-226. \n6 Maharaj v Attorney-General of Trinidad and Tobago (2) [1979] AC 385 (PC);\nAttorney-General of Trinidad and Tobago v Ramanoop [2005] 2 WLR 1324 (PC)\n(Trinidad and Tobago); Simpson v Attorney-General [1994] 3 NZLR 667 (NZCA);\nTaunoa v Attorney-General [2008] 1 NZLR 429 (NZSC) (New Zealand); Fose v\nMinister of Safety and Security 1997 3 SA 786 (CC); Zealand v Minister of Justice and\nConstitutional Development 2008 4 SA 458 (CC) (South Africa). \n', '136                                                             (2017) 17 AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\nsections 22(1) and (2)(b) which complement each other. Section\n22(1) provides that in the case of a detained person, any other person\ncan approach the court on his or her behalf alleging an infringement\nof the rights of the detained person. In terms of section 22(2)(b), the\ncourt can ‘issue such process’ as it may consider appropriate. This\nrecourse contemplates, among others, a process akin to the common\nlaw writ of habeas corpus,7 whereby a court can order that a detained\nperson be brought before it without further delay for the purposes of\ndetermining the lawfulness or otherwise of the detention. This process\nusually is not an action for damages but an application for the\nimmediate release of the person unlawfully detained.8 It often is a\nprompt remedial action rather than the action for damages which\nhappens ex post facto.9 This research has shown that, unlike in habeas\ncorpus applications, there appears to be no decided case(s) to suggest\nthat litigants in Lesotho have explored the options of compensation or\nconstitutional damages causes of action to ventilate breaches of their\npersonal liberty rights.\nHowever, neither constitutional damages as a cause of action nor\nthe problems inherent in their quantification are dwelt upon in the\narticle. Rather, this presentation critically analyses the wealth of case\nlaw where plaintiffs have claimed damages through the traditional\ncommon law cause of action with regard to wrongful arrest, detention\nand malicious prosecution in Lesotho.10 The inquiry closely follows\nthe process adopted by the courts in the adjudication of these issues.\nThe investigation, in essence, commences with establishing the\nliability of the defendant which, in turn, involves identifying the rights\nalleged to have been infringed.11 In this context, one encounters the\ninterplay of the constitutional rights to personal liberty and security of\nthe person, the dignity and reputation of the individual, on the one\nhand, and the circumstances in which that infringement occurred, on\nthe other. The origin of the right infringed or the process may be\nfound in the Constitution or the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act\n9 of 1981 (CPEA).12 Then follows the problematic quantification\nexercise which is usually the last in the sequence. The inquiry into the\nquantification aspect is omitted from the present discussion due to\n7 See eg Maseko v Attorney-General LAC (1990-1994) 13. \n8 See eg R v Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex Parte Armah [1968] AC 192 (HL); R v Home\nSecretary, Ex Parte Khawaja [1984] AC 74 (HL).\n9 See AW Bradley & KD Ewing Constitutional and administrative law (2007) 781;\nHWR\xa0Wade & C\xa0Forsyth Administrative Law (2009) 505.\n10 See eg Nkofi v Ramoreboli [2014] LSHC 65 (12 August 2014) paras 4-7. \n11 Kopo and Kopo v Commander of Lesotho Defence Force [2011] LSHC 122 (9 March\n2011) paras 29-34; Kalaile v Commissioner of Police [2011] LSHC 130 (20 September\n2011) para 15.\n12 As amended by the Criminal Procedure and Evidence (Amendment) Act 10 of\n2002. \n', 'STATE LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS IN LESOTHO                                                137\nspace constraints but, owing to its relevance to the subject matter, it\nis undertaken elsewhere.13 \nIt is clear from this study that there is a looming over-intrusiveness\nof the Lesotho military in the law enforcement sphere in the Kingdom\nwhere, in the normal course of things, it does not ordinarily have a\nrole to play.14 A distinction should be drawn between the military\ndabbling with mundane law enforcement of its own volition, a\nterritory unfamiliar to soldiers as against their functioning in the more\nfamiliar military terrain under the relevant national legislation.15 This\nissue recently arose as a challenge to the jurisdiction of the High Court\nin an application for habeas corpus by a detained senior military\nofficer.16 It was argued that the High Court, not sitting as a review\ncourt, lacked the jurisdiction to order the placing of Brigadier Mareka\nunder open arrest when such discretionary power was vested in the\ndefence force.17 It was further contended before the Court of Appeal\nthat the High Court had no jurisdiction to substitute the decision of\nthe defence force with its own, as only the defence force is by law\ngiven the discretion to make such a decision which would place a\nperson under closed or open arrest. In any event, the High Court did\nnot sit as a reviewing court, nor did it sit as a constitutional court in\nterms of section 22 of the Constitution. The Court of Appeal rejected\nthese arguments for the following reasons: First, not only because the\napplicant, the wife of the detainee, had locus standi to launch the\nhabeas corpus application in terms of section 22(1) of the\nConstitution, but also because the High Court, in terms of sections\n22(2)(a) and (b) of the Constitution, has inherent jurisdiction to hear\nand determine any application made pursuant to section 22(1), or to\ndeal with any question arising in relation to any proceedings under\nsubsection 22(3). The Court was unequivocal in holding that the High\nCourt had jurisdiction to hear and determine issues arising from the\npresent application related to the right to life under section 5; the\nright to personal liberty in terms of section 6; and freedom from\ninhuman treatment in section 8.18 The Court further held, given the\nnature of the process with which the High Court was concerned,\nnamely, an application for habeas corpus, that the question of the\nlegality of the continued detention of Brigadier Mareka was squarely\nin issue before the court a quo, so that the Crown had to legally justify\nthe arrest and continued detention of the Brigadier. Accordingly, it\n13 C Okpaluba ‘Damages for wrongful arrest, detention and malicious prosecution in\nLesotho: The problem of quantum’ (forthcoming).\n14 See the judgment of Mahase J in the habeas corpus case of Lerotholi v Commander\nof Lesotho Defence Force [2007] LSHC 8 (2 July 2007).

The cases of torture and\nbrutality encountered in the article abundantly illustrate a total\ndisrespect for due process, which is precisely the opposite of what the\nConstitution mandates and promotes and the CPEA protects. \n2 Relevant constitutional guarantees and statutory \nprotections\nAlthough the current Constitution of Lesotho cannot strictly be\ntermed a Westminster model constitution since the Kingdom\nabandoned her original Westminster Constitution of 1966 and after\nsome two decades of dictatorship and military rule made a new\nConstitution in 1993. However, both Constitutions are, for the\npurposes of the protection of fundamental human rights and\nfreedoms, one and same thing except for minor alterations. For\ninstance, section 4, which lists all the guaranteed rights, and section 6\nof the 1993 Constitution dealing with the right to personal liberty\nliterally are similar in terms to the provisions of sections 1 and 3 of the\nindependence Constitution of 1966. One peculiarity of both\nConstitutions is that in their guarantee of the right to personal liberty,\nin some instances, they incorporate established common law personal\nliberty rights20 and, in other instances, constitutionalise the criminal\nprocedural safeguards embedded in the criminal procedure legislation\nwhich pre-dated the independence Constitution. Accordingly, the\nlawfulness or otherwise of an arrest and detention often tends to\ndepend on what provision of the personal liberty right in the\nConstitution was violated or the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act\nthat was contravened. \n19 Mareka (n 16 above) para 12.\n20 The often-cited speech of Lord Atkin at the Privy Council in Eshugbayi Eleko v\nGovernment of Nigeria [1931] AC 662 670 is a classic illustration of the attitude of\nthe common law under discussion here. Extolling the English common law\nreference to the liberty of the individual even in the thriving days of colonialism,\nLord Atkin emphasised: ‘In accordance with British jurisprudence no member of\nthe executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a British subject except\non the condition that he can support the legality of his action before a court of\njustice. And it is the tradition of British justice that judges should not shrink from\ndeciding such issues in the face of the executive.’ \n', 'STATE LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS IN LESOTHO                                                139\n2.1 Right to personal liberty\nArrest or detention is an exception to the constitutional prohibition\nthat a person shall not be arrested or detained without the authority\nof the law in terms of section 6(1) of the 1993 Constitution if it was\nupon reasonable suspicion that the person had committed or was\nabout to commit a criminal offence under the law of Lesotho.21 In\nsection 6(2) it is provided that any person who is arrested or detained\nshall be informed as soon as is reasonably practicable, in a language\nhe understands, of the reasons for his arrest and detention. In terms of\nsection 6(3)(b) any person who is arrested or detained upon\nreasonable suspicion that he or she has committed or is about to\ncommit a criminal offence and who is not released \nshall be brought before a court as soon as is reasonably practicable, and\nwhere he is not brought before a court within forty-eight hours of his arrest\nor from the commencement of his detention, the burden of proving that\nhe has been brought before a court as soon as is reasonably practicable\nshall rest upon any person alleging that the provisions of this subsection\nhave been complied with. \nIt is further provided in section 6(5) that if any person arrested or\ndetained upon reasonable suspicion that the person has committed or\nis about to commit a criminal offence is not tried within ‘a reasonable\ntime’, then \nwithout prejudice to any further proceedings that may be brought against\nhim, he shall be released either unconditionally or upon reasonable\nconditions, including in particular such conditions as are reasonably\nnecessary to ensure that he appears at a later date for trial or for\nproceedings preliminary to trial. \nAs one would expect in any fledgling democracy where the military\nconstantly plays the role of neutralising the rule of law and the\nenforcement of fundamental human rights and freedoms, some of\nthese provisions have come up for interpretation and enforcement in\nthe courts. A few examples will suffice. In Bolofo v DPP,22 the Court of\nAppeal was considering an appeal on an application for bail which the\ncourt rightly observed required it to balance two competing interests,\nnamely, the interests of the criminal detainees in their basic right to\nliberty, on the one hand, and the interests of the community in\ncriminal suspects being prosecuted, on the other. After deliberating\nupon the provisions of sections 6(3)(b) and 6(5) (on personal liberty)\nand 12(1), (2) and (8) (on the right to a fair trial) of the Constitution,\nSteyn P, who delivered the judgment of a unanimous court, held that\nthe Constitution was not enacted merely for purposes of promoting\nthe Kingdom as a country that expresses a commitment to acceptable\ninternational norms and standards of behaviour. Rather, it is a solemn\nand effective covenant regulating the relationship between the Crown\n21 Sec 6(1)(e) Constitution of Lesotho.\n22 LAC (1995-1999) 231.\n', '140                                                             (2017) 17 AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\nand its citizens.23 Further, although the Constitution provides for the\nbasic right to personal liberty, as well as the presumption of\ninnocence in criminal matters and speedy trials, in Lesotho delayed\ncriminal trials are unfortunately the rule and not the exception,24 a\nstate of affairs that is unacceptable in a civilised state. The lengthy\ndetention of suspects without trial is an arbitrary form of punishment\nwhich negates the right to liberty and the right to be presumed\ninnocent. An accused person, who is deemed innocent until proven\nguilty by the Constitution, is entitled, once indicted, to be tried\nexpeditiously.25 The President of the Court of Appeal observed:26\nThese provisions can only be meaningful if all those involved in the\nadministration of justice perform their duties in a manner consistent with\nthe ethos and the values that underpin them. This obligation rests on those\nwho are part of the cohesive unit that administers criminal justice. Those\ninvolved include the following: the police officer that exercises the power\nof arrest and first detention; the judicial officer who is seized with\nresponsibility to decree the continued detention of the accused or his\nrelease on bail in terms and conditions upon which this is to occur and\nregulates the conduct of the trial; the Director of Public Prosecutions who\ndetermines whether and when a prosecution should be instituted and\nupon which charges and who exercises a discretion as to whether to\noppose bail or not; the High Court and this court as final arbiters of the fate\nof the accused; and ultimately the prison authorities who are obliged to see\nto the protection of the public by ensuring the secure incarceration of the\ncommitted prisoner and to see to his possible rehabilitation. Even the social\nservices that facilitate the reintegration of the released prisoner into society\nis part of such a unit. \nAnother illustration which leads us more directly to the issue at hand –\nestablishing liability for the purposes of wrongful arrest and unlawful\ndetention – is Maseko v Attorney-General,27 which reached the Court\nof Appeal as an application for habeas corpus and concerned the\nvalidity of the arrest and detention of the appellant in purported\ncompliance with the provisions of section 13(1) of the Internal\nSecurity (General) Act 24 of 1984. In order to decide whether the\narrest and detention were illegal, the Court of Appeal, per Ackermann\nJA, posed the following three questions: (a) Was the appellant at any\ntime material to his arrest informed by or on behalf of the person\narresting him of the reasons for his arrest and, if not, did such failure\nrender the arrest unlawful? (b) Must the arresting officer be the\nmember of the police force to have the reasonable suspicion required\nby section 13(1) of the Act or would it be sufficient if a second\nrespondent entertained it? (c) Did second respondent, on the facts,\ndischarge the onus of proving reasonable his suspicion that the\nappellant was a person involved in subversive activity?

All along this has been a\nrequirement of the common law,28 the application of which was not\nexcluded by section 13(1) of the Act.29 The facts of Maseko, however,\nreveal that the appellant was never adequately informed of the reason\nfor his arrest, thus rendering the arrest and detention illegal.\nAckermann JA held, once it is accepted that such reasons have to be\nfurnished to the person being arrested, then it is irrelevant for\npurposes of determining the extent to which the arrestee must be\ninformed whether the arrest is with or without warrant. In effect, the\nrules established for determining how fully the reasons have to be\nexplained in the case of an arrest with a warrant are equally applicable\nto the case of an arrest in terms of section 13(1).30 It would not have\nbeen sufficient merely to have told the appellant that he was being\narrested in terms of the Act or on account of the Act, as he could not\nfrom such information have determined whether he was being\narrested in terms of section 13(1) on a charge of sabotage, or because\nhe was a member of an unlawful organisation, or of unlawfully\npossessing a dangerous weapon, or for public indecency, or for a\nbreach of the peace, or for intimidation or annoyance. The bare\ninformation that he had been arrested in terms of section 13(1) would\nnot have served the purpose mentioned above:31 \nIn fact, the position is not far removed from that of a policeman who, in a\ncountry where the criminal law is codified, arrests a person and only tells\nsuch a person that he is being arrested for breaching the criminal code. It\nwould not even have been sufficient … to have told appellant that he was\nbeing arrested because of a suspicion that he was reasonably suspected of\nbeing involved in subversive activity. \nThe definitions of subversive activities in section 3(1) of the Act cover\na wide field. This is greater reason why the arrested person must know\nin substance the particular acts he is suspected of having committed\nor conspired to commit.32\nGranted that at the time Maseko was decided the 1966\nConstitution of Lesotho had long been suspended, such that the\ndetermination of the issues involved in that case could only have been\nbased on the CPEA or the common law or both. As has been\nobserved, it was the common law principle that came to the rescue of\n28 See Christie v Leachinsky [1947] 1 All ER 567 (HL) 573A & C-E; Walker v Lovell\n[1975] 3 All ER 107 (HL) 115; Brand v Minister of Justice 1959 (4) SA 712 (A)\n718B-C.\n29 See now sec 6(2) Constitution of Lesotho.\n30 Maseko (n 27 above) 29F-G.\n31 Maseko 31B-E/F.\n32 Maseko 32E-F.\n', '142                                                             (2017) 17 AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\nthe appellant. In the more recent case of Kalaile v Commissioner of\nPolice,33 the plaintiff could have relied on the constitutional or\nstatutory protection or both, but he preferred to challenge the\nunlawfulness of his arrest in terms of section 32(4) of the CPEA\nbecause he had not been informed of the reason for his arrest.34 It\nwas for the arrestor to prove that it was lawful.35 The judge was not\nconvinced by the defendant’s version of events, and found that there\nwas ‘a malicious ring’ to the conduct of the officers who, as it were,\napprobated and reprobated: They arrested the plaintiff and, at the\nsame time, wanted to let him go. Finally, they rearrested and detained\nhim and, for that matter, beyond the 48 hour limit before taking him\nto court. There was no doubt that the officers as peace officers\narrested the plaintiff for an alleged offence committed in their\npresence. As Harms DP observed, this power of arrest without a\nwarrant could be used ‘to arrest for petty crimes such as parking\noffences, drinking in public and the like’.36 Again, even if police\nofficers have the power and discretion to arrest, this power must be\nexercised within the bounds of rationality.37 Chaka-Makhooane J\naccordingly held that the police officers clearly had the discretion and\npower to arrest which they could have used rationally: They could\nhave warned the plaintiff. Rather, by adopting an attitude whereby\nthe plaintiff either showed remorse or faced arrest and detention, their\naction smacked of mala fides. The police officers thereby acted\nunreasonably in arresting the plaintiff. They did not use their power\nand discretion rationally. \nAdopting further the South African Supreme Court of Appeal\njudgment in Sekhoto,38 the learned judge held that the suspected\noffence was relatively trivial and, consequently, the arrest was\nunnecessary and any form of detention was certainly irrational and\nunjustified. Indeed, there was no reasonable explanation for keeping\nthe plaintiff in police cells for that length of time, even if it was still\nwithin the 48-hour period, for an alleged offence that was so trivial\nthat the officers themselves were willing to release the plaintiff on\nwarning.39 \n33 Kalaile (n 11 above).\n34 Nqumba v State President 1987 (1) SA 456 (E); Thamae v COP [2001] LSCA 129\n(4 December 2001).\n35 Maseko (n 27 above) 17-18.\n36 Minister of Safety and Security v Sekhoto 2011 (5) SA 367 (SCA) para 6. \n37 Sekhoto (n 36 above) para 14.\n38 As above.\n39 For a recent South African case on warning, see the Constitutional Court\njudgment in MR v Minister of Safety and Security 2016 (2) SACR 540 (CC).\nAlthough this case concerned whether in exercising their discretion to arrest a\nchild, the police officers took into consideration the best interests of the child in\nterms of sec 28(2) of the 1996 Constitution, the Court took the opportunity to\nemphasise the duty on the part of the police in terms of sec 40(1) of the CPA to\nconsider and weigh all the facts carefully and exercise a value judgment whether\nan arrest could be justified. In the instant case, they could have issued the child a\n', 'STATE LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS IN LESOTHO                                                143\n2.1.2 Who should entertain the suspicion?\nAs far as this question is concerned, the Court held that it was the\npolice officer effecting the arrest who was required by section 13(1) of\nthe Act to entertain the requisite suspicion. The police officer who\narrested the appellant did so because he had the statutory power to\neffect such an arrest. He was neither an agent, servant nor instrument\nof anyone in this regard. In exercising his section 13(1) powers he had\nto satisfy himself that he was entitled to do so. The power of arrest in\nthis instance was not different from an arrest under the CPEA. For,\nalthough the Minister of Police may be held liable in delict for the\nwrongful arrest of a person, the decision to arrest that person remains\nwithin the discretion of the police officer.40 He or she is not\ncompelled to arrest,41 neither can the arrest be effected in obedience\nto superior orders42 nor carried out merely to make a point to\ncolleagues that he or she was not racist.43\nThus, in delivering judgment for a full court of the Lesotho Court of\nAppeal in Jobo & Others v Commander, Lesotho Defence Force &\nOthers,44 Chinhengo AJA held that the legislature in enacting the\nLesotho Defence Force Act of 1966 had reposed the power on the\nmanner of custody or form of arrest of an accused member of the\nforce remanded for further investigation, summary trial or trial by\ncourt martial, on the unit commander. Consequently, a court cannot\nbe called upon to scrutinise the merits of the unit commander’s\ndecision, but it may be called upon to scrutinise the manner in which\nthat decision was arrived at. In doing so the court will have regard to\nthe Wednesbury principles embedded in the modern concepts of\nillegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.45 Therefore, when\nin his judgment a quo Peete J stated that his court was not sitting to\nreview the decision of the Lesotho defence force (LDF),46 the Acting\nJustice of Appeal wondered47 \n39 warning and made the father who was present undertake to bring the child to\ncourt when requested to do so.

In order to avoid falling into such a\npitfall, the decision maker, according to the Wednesbury\nunreasonableness principle, must take into account (relevant) factors\nthat ought to be considered and not take into account (irrelevant)\nfactors that ought to be avoided.50 \n2.1.3 Proving the reasonableness of the suspicion\nHaving found the arrest in Maseko to be unlawful on other grounds,\nthe court was not compelled to but did find it advisable to deliver an\nopinion on the issue of reasonable suspicion as it pertained to the\ncase. It was held that the jurisdictional facts justifying arrest under\nsection 13(1) were not dependent on the subjective state of mind of\nthe arresting member of the force, but on an objective criterion,\ndepending on proof by the second respondent that he, as a matter of\nfact, entertained the requisite suspicion and that such belief was\nreasonable in all the circumstances. In effect, the existence of the\n‘reasonable suspicion’ is objectively justiciable.51 In any event the\ncourt must decide whether the suspicion was entertained and\nwhether it was reasonable. In order so to decide, Ackermann JA\nreferred to the following judgments: \n• Lord Devlin said in Shaban Bin Hussein v Chong Fook Kam52 that\nsuspicion in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjecture or surmise\nwhere proof is lacking: ‘I suspect but I cannot prove.’ Suspicion arises\nat or near the starting point of an investigation of which the\n48 Fedsure Life Assurance Ltd v Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council\n1999 (1) SA 374 (CC) para 56.\n49 Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of SA: In re Ex Parte President of South\nAfrica 2000 (2) SA 674 (CC) para 20. \n50 Jobo (n 46 above) para 36.

Thus reasonable suspicion\ncannot be equated with prima facie proof. \n• Scott LJ had held in Dumbell v Roberts53 that the requirement that\nbefore arresting the police officer must satisfy himself that there in\nfact existed reasonable grounds for suspicion of the arrestee’s guilt, is\nlimited to the police having nothing near a prima facie case for\nconviction. \n• Wentzel JA of the Lesotho Court of Appeal held in Solicitor-General v\nMapetla54 that, although a suspicion may not be equated with prima\nfacie proof it must be reasonable: It must be such that a reasonable\nperson in possession of the facts would agree that there was\nreasonable ground to suspect that the person involved was\nconcerned in subversive activity.55\nAs there was no iota of evidence leading to the ground upon which\nthe arrestors in Mapetla based their suspicion that the senior and\nrespectable chief in that case was involved in any subversive activity\nagainst the state, so, also, the officer concerned in Maseko did not\npossess the necessary suspicion, thus rendering the arrest and\ndetention in both cases illegal. Accordingly, the allegations by the\nsecond respondent against the appellant did not objectively amount\nto suspicion of involvement in subversive activity, far less a reasonable\none, so that the requirements of section 13(1) had not been satisfied.\nThe border line between capricious or arbitrary arrest and the\nsafeguard afforded the citizen is the requirement of reasonableness on\nthe part of the arresting authority. Thus, Ackermann JA held that a\nbald statement that the appellant had indulged in subversive\nactivities, as defined in the Internal Security Act, was insufficient\nwithout supplying the information on which that suspicion was held.\nIt was not sufficient merely to state a conclusion without supplying\nsome information on which such a conclusion or suspicion was based.\nTo begin with, the evidential burden of proof could only be\ndischarged by proof of facts. Again, by not proving facts in support of\nthe conclusion, the court would be precluded from assessing the\nreasonableness of the conclusion or suspicion and, thereby, precluded\nfrom the finding that the onus has been discharged. The\nreasonableness of the suspicion could only be assessed from the facts\nshown, not the conclusion drawn.56 \n53 [1944] 1 All ER 326 (CA) 329.\n54 [1985] LSCA 126 (26 July 1985).\n55 For more recent South African cases on reasonable suspicion to arrest and the\nlegal justifiability of the detention, see C Okpaluba ‘Reasonable suspicion and\nconduct of the police officer in arrest without warrant: Are the demands of the Bill\nof Rights a fifth jurisdictional fact’ (2014) 27 South African Journal of Criminal Justice\n325.\n56 Maseko (n 27 above) 35C/D-F. In Phiri v Commander, RLDF LAC (1990-1994) 233\n238 B/C-E, Steyn JA held that having regard to the draconian nature of the\nLesotho Paramilitary Force Act 13 of 1980 as amended by Order 3 of 1990,\ndeparting as it were from the principle that a subject should not be deprived of\nhis or her liberty without due process, and having regard to the nature of the\ndiscretion conferred on the commander of the army in the instant case, it was\nonly the commander who could properly depose of his own mental processes as\n', '146                                                             (2017) 17 AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\n2.2 Right to legal advice \nFollowing the unrest which had occurred in Lesotho on 15 October\n1998, the respondents in Commander of Lesotho Defence Force &\nOthers v Rantuba & Others,57 all members of the LDF, were arrested\nand detained by the military authorities for allegedly having\nparticipated in a mutiny. They were denied access to their legal\nadvisers. Their wives, therefore, made an urgent application for an\norder directing the appellants to allow the detained persons’ access to\ntheir legal advisers and an order that they be charged or released\nforthwith. Two issues arose for determination before the Court of\nAppeal: (a) the entitlement of a person detained, under the military\nlaw of Lesotho, to access to a legal adviser; and (b) whether the order\nof the High Court directing that the detainee be charged within eight\ndays or released had been correctly granted.\nThe full court of the Lesotho Court of Appeal held that at common\nlaw, there was a fundamental or basic right of access to legal advice,58\nwhich is a corollary of the right of access to court and is a right that\nsurvives incarceration. Such right may exist even where the right to\nlegal representation has been lawfully excluded. Although this right\nmay be taken away or attenuated by legislation,59 the Constitution\nhas not removed it. In any case, the onus of proving such taking away\nor attenuation is on the person who so asserts.60 Section 24(3) of the\nConstitution did not exempt the military from its provisions since that\nsection is not included in those specifically mentioned as affected by\nmilitary law. In Jobo61 the full court of the Court of Appeal held that\nan understanding of the provisions of section 24(3) of the\nConstitution started by appreciating the essence of section 2 of the\nsame Constitution, which makes the Constitution the supreme law of\nLesotho such that any other law that is inconsistent with it, to the\nextent of the inconsistency, shall be void. With this in mind, it follows\nthat section 24(3) could not have authorised parliament to enact a\nlaw that would go against the fundamental premise of the\nConstitution, that is, a law that does not accord with the principle of\nconstitutionalism. For instance, a court martial cannot lawfully be\n56 to whether he actually formed the necessary opinion which led to the arrest and\ndetention of the persons concerned and deposed to the facts he relied upon to do\nso. In other words, the available evidence and circumstances of the case were not\nsufficient to support the view that the commander relied on evidence and\ncircumstances to form the necessary opinion. \n57 LAC (1995-1999) 687 (Rantuba).\n58 Rantuba (n 57 above) 691A-B.

In\nother words, a member of the force, whatever his or her rank, does\nnot cease to be a citizen so as to lose his or her constitutionallyguaranteed\nrights. The truth of the matter is that while a member of\nthe armed forces remained subject to the ordinary laws of the state he\nor she is also subordinate to an ‘entirely distinct code of military law’.\nThe LDF Act and Regulations contain a number of provisions designed\nto procure, secure and ensure the legality of arrests and detention of\nsoldiers suspected of having committed offences and these provisions\nare consistent with the Constitution. However, because these\nprovisions restrict the ordinary rights of persons affected by them,\nthey must be interpreted strictly.64 Commenting on the judgment of\nHlajoane J in the second of the consolidated Jobo appeals, Chinhengo\nAJA held: \nThe judge a quo was of the view that the appellants contended that the\nrespondents’ rights under Chapter II have been taken away by section\n24(3) of the Constitution. She could not have been correct. Neither did the\nappellants hold that the respondents have no rights at all nor could they\nhave validly taken that position, assuming they so contended.\nThe Acting Justice of Appeal referred to Mandela v Minister of Prisons65\nand Rantuba for the proposition that a detainee under military law\nretains his common law rights unless such rights, expressly or by\nnecessary implication, have been attenuated by statute. The same\nmust be the position with respect to rights under Chapter II. As stated\nin Rantuba, the retention of rights guaranteed under Chapter II is not\na matter which depends upon the conferral by statute, but rather on\nwhether the statute attenuates (those rights). This means that the\nrights under Chapter II may be attenuated by military law but not\nextinguished. ‘Attenuate’ ordinarily means to weaken or reduce in\nforce or effect; to weaken; to dilute. The rights under Chapter II,\ntherefore, may only be ‘weakened’ or ‘diluted’ under a military law in\norder to align them with the exigencies of the military. \nFurther, referring to Sekoati & Others v President of the Court Martial\n& Others,66 the court addressed the issue of judicial independence in\n62 Approving per Maqutu J Rantuba & Others v Commander, Lesotho Defence Force &\nOthers CIV/APN/418/98; [1998] LSCA 110 13.\n63 Rantuba (n 62 above) 12-13.\n64 Mbali v Minister of Police 1954 (2) SA 596 598C.\n65 1983 (1) SA 938 (A).\n66 LAC (1995-1999) 812 827F-828C & 831H.\n', '148                                                             (2017) 17 AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\nthe context of section 12(1) as read with section 118(2) of the\nConstitution, which provides a clear basis for understanding the\nscope, import and effect of section 24(3).67 It was held in that case\nthat the framers of the Constitution deliberately enacted the unique\nsection 24(3) in order to define a different legal regime to govern\nmilitary affairs through military tribunals which are different from\ncivilian courts. In effect,68 \n[t]he Lesotho Constitution creates a particular legal regime for the military\nin general and courts-martial in particular. The full panoply of fundamental\nrights is expressly not available to the military. Courts-martial must\nnevertheless be independent – but in the sense and to a degree\nappropriate to their inherent nature as military, not civilian, courts. \nThe Court of Appeal then held that the appellants in Jobo could never\ntake the position that members of the military have been stripped of\ntheir fundamental rights and freedoms under Chapter II. The rights of\nmilitary personnel, in terms of section 24(3), are attenuated to the\nextent provided in the LDF Act and the regulations made thereunder.\nSection 24(3) provides for the limitation of fundamental rights and\nfreedoms of military personnel by a military law, but only to the\nextent that the limitation is fair, reasonable and justifiable in a\ndemocratic society based on principles and objectives of the\nConstitution. However, no issue has been raised of the current military\nlaw not measuring up to this standard.69\nIn short, the common law right of access to legal advice had not\nbeen removed by the Constitution.70 Nor is there anything in the\nLesotho Defence Force Act 4 of 1996 which could be read as having\nremoved the right of access to legal advice in respect of military\npersonnel. The Court further held that the commander of the army\ndid not possess the power to choose to permit or deny access to legal\nadvisers by detainees, as this right has been conferred by the common\nlaw and not by statute.71 Finally, there is no evidence to show that\nthe detainees’ access to legal advisers would impact negatively on\n67 Sec 24(3) of the Constitution of Lesotho 1993 provides: ‘In relation to any person\nwho is a member of a disciplined force raised under a law of Lesotho, nothing\ncontained in or done under the authority of the disciplinary law of that force shall\nbe held to be inconsistent with or in contravention of any of the provisions of this\nChapter other than sections 5, 8 and 9.’ \n68 LAC (1995-1999) 812 831H.\n69 Jobo (n 44 above) para 71.\n70 Rantuba (n 57 above) 695D.\n71 Rantuba 695C. Compare Thornhill v Attorney-General of Trinidad and Tobago\n[1980] 2 WLR 510 (PC) where, approving the judgment of Georges J, the Privy\nCouncil held that the right of a person arrested and detained as the appellant\nfound himself on 17-20 October 1973, to consult a lawyer of his choice was spelt\nout in sec 2(c)(ii) of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago 1962 and\nproclaimed by sec 1 to be a right that had existed on the coming into force of the\nConstitution and had continued to exist. Therefore, if there was a law in force in\nTrinidad and Tobago, whether written or as part of the unwritten common law\nwhich empowered the police to prevent a person in the situation of the appellant\nfrom exercising that right, it was for the respondents to prove that it did not\ninfringe that right.\n', 'STATE LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS IN LESOTHO                                                149\ninternal stability, more especially because the commander had\narbitrarily permitted the detainees’ access to their family members\nwhile denying them access to their legal advisers.\n2.3 The charge or release issue\nThe second issue in Rantuba related to the interpretation and\napplication of the provisions of section 6(3) of the 1993 Constitution,\nwhich requires arrested and detained persons to be brought to court\nexpeditiously (normally within 48 hours) or to be released. It was held\nthat this principle applied to military personnel save to the extent that\nthey were governed by special legislation, as provided for in section\n24(3) of the Constitution.72 Further, in the prevailing circumstances of\ninstability in the country arising from mutiny by soldiers, there had\nnot been an undue delay in investigating allegations against the\ndetainees and bringing them to trial in terms of the applicable\nlegislation, namely, section 89 of Lesotho Defence Force Act 4 of 1996\nand the relevant rules and regulations. In the circumstances, the trial\ncourt was wrong to have fixed a period of eight days within which the\ndetainees were to be charged or released.73 \n2.4 Torture, inhuman and degrading treatment\nSection 8(1) of the Constitution of Lesotho clearly protects everyone\nfrom torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or other\ntreatment.74 These provisions notwithstanding, acts of cruelty are\nfrom time to time perpetrated by the Lesotho military, as can be seen\nin the following cases. For instance, the dastardly and barbaric acts\nwitnessed in Mohlaba & Others v Commander, Royal Lesotho Defence\nForce & Another75 prompted Leon JA to liken the treatment meted out\nto the appellants as reminiscent of the exercise of the KGB and the\nGestapo, and the treatment meted out to the late Steve Biko of South\nAfrica, which conduct called for the strictest censure in Lesotho.76 The\nappellants were held in detention in deplorable conditions for a\nconsiderable period. They were tortured and assaulted. The plaintiffs\nwere suspected of misappropriating certain moneys at the Labour\nConstruction Unit; they were detained and taken to the ‘torture\n72 Rantuba (n 57 above) 695G.\n73 Rantuba 697D-E.

Indeed, they did not even plead. Chaka-Makhooane J,\ntherefore, had to assume the facts pleaded by the plaintiff who had been arrested\nand detained without being charged or brought to court. The plaintiff alleged\nthat he had been unlawfully and maliciously arrested and detained for 58½ hours,\nwhich was longer than the 48 hours within which the arresting officer should have\nbrought him before court. According to the judge (para 30), ‘[i]t is trite that the\nlawful period of detention is forty-eight hours’.\n74 Compare sec 5(1) of the 1966 Constitution.\n75 LAC (1995-1999) 184.\n76 Mohlaba (n 75 above) 191F/G-H.\n', '150                                                             (2017) 17 AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\nchamber’. Although the manner of their torture differed, the general\nconditions of their detention, food and absence of facilities were\nsimilar. \nThe facts of Mohlaba were in many ways more or less replicated in\nLetsie v Commander, Royal Lesotho Defence Force & Another77 with\nregard to the treatment by the Lesotho military of one of its highranking\nofficers. First, the claim was for pain and suffering arising out\nof torture and assault by members of military intelligence and military\npolice. Second, the defendants admitted liability, and the High Court\nof Lesotho was called upon to determine the issue of quantum.\nAlthough the insanitary conditions of detention of the plaintiff in Letsie\nwas equally deplorable, it was the torture that appeared more\npronounced than in the Mohlaba case. In Letsie, the plaintiff alleged\nthat he had been insulted, belittled and humiliated before his junior\nofficers. The trial judge had to accept the evidence of the plaintiff,\nwhich was not contested by the defendants. The Court of Appeal had\nto take into account the facts of these two cases, including the version\nof the torture involved, in quantifying the damages awarded in each\ncase.\n2.4.1 Justice Peete on the ‘sub-culture of brutality’\nIn Kopo and Kopo v Commander LDF,78 Peete J addressed what he\ncalled ‘the sub-culture of atrocity, brutality and inhuman treatment’\nthat appeared to pervade the interaction between the members of the\nLesotho military and the community at large. The judge was\ncommenting on the amounts claimed by the plaintiffs as being rather\nhigh and that they ought to be reduced, but that ‘what remains\nunmoved or unshakable are the sad and somber facts of the arrest\nand detention, their unlawfulness, their unfoundedness and absence\nof just cause’. Recounting the sordid facts of this case, better\nexpressed in the judge’s own words, Peete J said:79 \nThe first plaintiff, a retired soldier of high standing, was arrested in public –\nprobably in full view of his work mates; was handcuffed and bundled into\nan army van at gun point and driven post haste to Ratjomose barracks –\nsubjected to rigorous interrogation that was based on misinformation\nabout ABC links. The first plaintiff was continuously kept handcuffed for\nabout 26 hours and not temporarily allowed even a free hand to enable\nhim pass water on his own. An ordinary Mosotho man values his manhood\nand his ‘penis’ as one of his most private and precious assets of his body. A\nyoungish soldier, Mofomobe had an unpleasant duty to unzip the pants of\nthe first plaintiff and take out his penis so that he could pass water. This\ndisgraceful humiliation was done twice. One wonders: Having arrested,\nsearched and handcuffed first plaintiff, why was first plaintiff’s other hand\n[not] let free and he be escorted under armed guard to the toilet so that he\nmight be able to relieve himself? The only other motive – beside alleged\nsecurity reasons – could only be to humiliate first plaintiff where it hurt\n77 Civ/T/538/05 (28 July 2009); LAC (2009-2010) 549.\n78 [2011] LSHC 122 (9 March 2011). \n79 Kopo and Kopo (n 78 above) paras 38-39.\n', 'STATE LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS IN LESOTHO                                                151\nmost – his private manhood! Humiliation suffered by him was most\nextreme and hurtful to any reasonable, decent, respectable and right\nthinking Mosotho man. At any rate, none of the senior army officers\nthereat could have tolerated the said treatment meted unto themselves.\nThe Biblical advice ‘… do unto others as you would like them do unto yee\n…’ still has a moral force even in our courts! The treatment meted to first\nplaintiff was atrocious, humiliating and shameful as well as unbefitting the\nserving members of the LDF. Brutality, atrocity and cruelty, besides being\nwholly uncivilized, dehumanizes other beings. Not only delictual but\ncriminal liability may be attracted. Brutality and inhuman or sadistic\ntreatment have been outlawed by many international instruments,\nespecially the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To allow, or to\ntolerate or to condone acts of cruelty and inhumanity tarnishes both our\nnational image and our very civilization. \nThe acts of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment have remained\nunabated in Lesotho for it appears that at the slightest sign of political\nupheaval, one or other section of the Kingdom’s military would take\nthe law into its own hands, and this recourse finds expression in the\narrest, detention and kidnapping of members of the other section or\ngroup in the army. Quite recently, while hearing the applications for\nhabeas corpus in the case of Jobo & Others v Commander, Lesotho\nDefence Force & Others,80 Peete J once more reverted to the issue.\nSeveral serving soldiers were arrested under section 86 of the Lesotho\nDefence Force Act 4 of 1996 on charges under sections 48 and 49 of\nthe Act, and the question before court was whether such arrests were\nunlawful, amounting to kidnapping or abduction. Delivering his\njudgment, Peete J made the following remarks:81\nToday, we live in a democratic Lesotho and it is imperative that all\ninstitutions and organs of state – without exception – must discharge their\nfunctions according to the Constitution, to the law and in a civilised\nmanner; brutality, cruelty or sadism cannot be countenanced by this court\nbecause all such are evil acts against our human nature as Basotho and are\nacts that violate even the will of God. Foot shackles – this court observed –\nindeed remind one of the days of slavery when men and women in West\nAfrica were tightly shackled and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to\nNorth America.

This is not\nnegotiable because its repetition will tarnish the reputation of Lesotho in\nthe international landscape and perhaps irreversibly so. \nCommenting further on the said sub-culture, the judge observed as\nfollows:83 \nA sub-culture of atrocity, brutality and inhuman treatment should not be\nallowed to flourish in the armed forces; besides dehumanizing the victims,\nit promotes a self-perpetuating desire of revenge and retribution and can\nmanifest itself in terrible and long lasting post-traumatic effects to all\npersons concerned. It also has a rippling labeling effect throughout the\nmilitary institution. Very high standards of behaviour and discipline are\nrequired from the army personnel and at times these high standards call for\nhigh personal sacrifice of life and limb and at the expense of their own\nhuman rights.84 A soldier obeys commands at all times and much has been\nsaid and written about the topic ‘Obedience to Superior Orders’.85 \nThese comments were prompted by a number of incidents. First, the\ndetained soldiers were brought to court in leg shackles and handcuffs\nand were being escorted by masked and heavily-armed security\npersonnel. Second, each soldier testified in court of having been\nsubjected to cruel treatment and showed the court fresh and deep\ncuts and bruises on their wrists, probably caused by tightened\nhandcuffs.86 \n3 Where liability is conceded\nA common feature discernible from these cases can be put as follows:\n(a) that there is the tale of brutality by the police and army officers on\nindividual citizens on the pretext of enforcing the law; and (b) that\nthe concessions that are made in most of the cases can be baffling.\nMost often the defendant does not dispute liability and quantum\nremains the only issue for the court to determine.87 Where this\nhappens one can only ascertain the grounds that led to liability being\nconceded from the facts upon which the quantification analysis was\n83 Kopo and Kopo (n 78 above) paras 40-41.\n84 Sec 24(3) Constitution of Lesotho.\n85 See eg R v Mokhantso CRI/95/02; MJ Osiel ‘Obeying orders: Atrocity, military\ndiscipline, and law of war’ (1998) 86 California Law Review 938.\n86 Jobo (n 46 above) para 5.\n87 Eg, in Molise v Officer Commanding Thaba Tseka Police Post [2013] LSHC 74\n(11 March 2013) paras 10 & 13-18, the plaintiff abandoned his claim for unlawful\narrest and detention for alleged stock theft because the police had reasonable\nsuspicion to that effect while the defendants did not contest his claim for assault\nin police custody. Mahase J emphasised that an assault in whatever form is a delict\naffecting a person’s bodily integrity and a breach of the fundamental right to the\nprotection against torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or other such\ntreatment by anybody upon a human being under sec 9(1) of the Constitution of\nLesotho. The judge held that as a human being his right to be treated ‘humanely\nand with dignity are protected under the Constitution’. The plaintiff’s evidence\nthat he had been subjected to torture, inhuman and degrading punishment for\none hour by police officers whose duty it was to uphold the rule of law and to\n', 'STATE LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS IN LESOTHO                                                153\nundertaken by the court. In such a situation the discussion centres on\nthose instances (a) where assaults were committed for no apparent\nreason; (b) where the plaintiff was detained on no legal basis; and\n(c) where the parties agree on the terms of settlement, whether one\nof them can renege on those terms or opt out of the agreement.\nWhile the first two issues are discussed below, the latter point is\ndiscussed in the context of quantification, the classification where it\nbelongs. \n3.1 Assault for no just cause\nThe alleged ‘offence’ of the plaintiff in Morobi v Commissioner of\nPolice88 was that he was being disrespectful to government officials\nsimply because, when the police officers asked him to stop, he did not\nget out of the car but merely lowered his window. In the process of\nbarraging the plaintiff with questions the officers spotted an incorrect\nentry of the expiry date of the plaintiff’s learner’s licence of which the\nplaintiff was not even aware. Instead of arresting him, if they had\nreasonable grounds to suspect that he had committed an offence,\nthey embarked on inflicting a physical assault on him, using pepper\nspray in his eyes and ears and assaulting him with police sticks. They\ndemanded money, which the plaintiff did not have. They left him\nwaiting at the scene of the incident for several hours as instructed, but\nthey did not return. A medical report confirmed an assault on the\nplaintiff’s ribs with a blunt instrument; a severe degree of force was\nused causing injury to life, with a ‘moderate, degree of immediate\ndisability – moderate degree of long term disability – partial’. The\nplaintiff used to work at a place where he carried bags of seeds which\nhe could no longer do after the assaults. The assaults took place in\npublic and, as a pastor, his congregation started to look at him\ndifferently after the attacks. All these factors caused humiliation and a\nlowering of his dignity.89\nThe recent case of Mokaka v Commissioner of Police90 is another case\nof assault involving no arrest or detention.91 The police officers had\nordered the plaintiff, a construction worker, returning from a\ncircumcision school, to drop his stick and raise his hands, which he\n87 protect him was not contradicted. However, it was more disturbing to find that\nthe cattle allegedly stolen by him were not found in his possession, and it was for\nthat reason that the police released him from custody. Meanwhile, the ‘unjustified\nbrutal torture and assault’ which the judge found ‘shocking and deplorable’ and\n‘clearly criminal offences’ had taken place. In other words, the cattle in question\nhad been found but not in the plaintiff’s possession, even though the police had\nalready subjected the plaintiff to ‘intensive, prolonged brutal assault and torture\non a suspicion that it was the plaintiff who had stolen same’. \n88 [2012] LSHC 1 (9 February 2012). \n89 Morobi (n 88 above) paras 20-21 & 27.

One of the police officers assaulted him with the stick and left\nwith it. Medical evidence showed that the plaintiff had sustained a\n‘deformed left forearm, reduced range of movement at the elbow\njoint as well as pain and tenderness over the deformed part of the\narm’. As a result of the injuries sustained, the plaintiff will ‘not be able\nto do normal work at his place of employment because of the reduced\nrange of movement’. The assault was inflicted in full public view\nwhere some villagers had gathered nearby, apparently to watch the\nincident. The court had no difficulty in accepting the plaintiff’s\nevidence, as collaborated by eye witness testimony, as more probable\nthan the entire afterthought story of the defendant, which Monapathi\nACJ described as ‘not only riddled of improbabilities and absurdities\nbut also preposterous and laughable. Suffice to say that no reasonable\ncourt may accept it.’92\n3.2 Where there was no basis for detention\nAlthough the defendants in Kopo and Kopo v Commander LDF93\nadmitted that the plaintiff had been taken in for questioning, they\nconceded that there was no lawful basis whatsoever for detaining\nhim. Even after his release the following day, no further investigation\nor steps were taken regarding any involvement of the plaintiff in the\nprevailing insurgency, which was the reason for his arrest in the first\ninstance. Peete J considered ‘aggravation and humiliation’ and the\n‘sub-culture of brutality and inhuman treatment’94 involved in this\ncase before the issue of quantum. The trial judge referred to\nMohlaba,95 where Leon J described the treatment meted out to the\nplaintiff as ‘barbaric’ and ‘disgraceful’, and observed that the\naggravation was very extreme, and detentions very lengthy. The\njudge also referred to Letsie, where Scott JA found the type of\ntreatment received by the plaintiff as ‘almost too ghastly to\ncontemplate’.96 The only difference between these cases and Kopo\nand Kopo was that the officer had neither been tortured nor physically\nassaulted, but otherwise he was ‘grossly humiliated both during the\nrelentless interrogation and when he was caused to urinate with the\nhelp of a junior officer unzipping his pants and taking out his penis to\nurinate’.97\n4 Unlawful arrest and detention\nExcept in those instances where, as has been observed, police officers\nhave displayed wanton abuse of their powers by inflicting physical\n92 Mokaka (n 90 above) para 18.\n93 Kopo and Kopo (n 78 above). \n94 Kopo and Kopo paras 38-41.\n95 Mohlaba (n 75 above) 191G & J.\n96 Letsie (n 73 above) para 14.\n97 Kopo and Kopo (n 78 above) para 44.\n', 'STATE LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS IN LESOTHO                                                155\ninjuries by way of assault on hapless individuals without any\nprovocation whatsoever and without any intention of arresting or\ndetaining their victims and, therefore, the claims did not include\nwrongful arrests or detentions, most of the cases discussed and those\nto be discussed later in the article involve claims for wrongful arrest\nand detention. For instance, there are the cases of Mapetla v SolicitorGeneral98\nand Kopo and Kopo v Commander LDF,99 where there were\narrests and detentions for no apparent reason. Similar are the cases on\ntorture: Mohlaba v Commander, Royal Lesotho Defence Force &\nAnother,100 and Letsie v Commander, Royal Lesotho Defence Force.101\nSince these cases have already been discussed in the article, it will\nsuffice to limit the present discussion to the case cited below.\nHaving held in Lethole v Commissioner of Police102 that in terms of\nsection 6 of the Constitution it is every citizen’s right to enjoy his or\nher right to personal liberty and not to be arrested or detained save as\nmay be authorised by law, Majara J proceeded to hold that this right\n‘is one of the most fiercely-guarded fundamental rights in a\nconstitutional democracy’ and any interference with it must be done\nunder very compelling and lawful circumstances, to the extent that\neven where the subject is detained by law enforcement agents, ‘it\nshould only be for the purpose of bringing him to court and for no\nother reason least of all an unlawful one’.103 This argument is in line\nwith the reasoning of the South African Supreme Court of Appeal in\nMinister of Safety and Security v Sekhoto,104 where Harms DP reiterated\nthe purpose of an arrest given the controversy that trailed that case to\nthe Appeal Court. He held, first, that it was clear that the power to\narrest was to be exercised only for the purpose of bringing the suspect\nto justice; however, the arrest was but one step in that process.105\nSecond, the arrestee was to be brought before court as soon as was\nreasonably practicable,106 and the authority to detain the suspect\nfrom that moment on was at the discretion of the court.107 \n98 [1984] LSHC 123 (29 November 1984).\n99 Kopo and Kopo (n 78 above). \n100 Mohlaba (n 75 above).\n101 Letsie (n 73 above).\n102 [2014] LSHC 74 (12 August 2014).\n103 Lethole (n 102 above) para 15.

In that case the\nChief Justice extensively reviewed the law of malicious prosecution\nfrom its early beginnings; the misgivings expressed by Professor Lee\nearlier in the twentieth century; and the absence of reasonable and\nprobable cause in the Roman-Dutch origins of the action.122 The\nChief Justice also made reference to the South African courts\nembracing the proof of both an indirect or improper motive on the\n117 For a review of recent Commonwealth case law, see C Okpaluba ‘Does\n“prosecution” in the law of malicious prosecution include malicious civil\nproceedings?

So, where there is no\nevidence to show that the criminal proceedings had terminated in the plaintiff’s\nfavour or that the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) had\ndecided to withdraw the criminal charge, the cause of action for malicious\nprosecution does not arise: Kolane v Attorney-General LAC (1990-1994) 73\n74G/H-J.

It has been held that entering a nolle prosequi is termination of\nprosecution in favour of the plaintiff – Beckett v NSW 2013 HCA 17 (8 May 2013).\nSuppose the DPP intimates to the court that he no longer wants to proceed with\nthe prosecution of the case in court, could the trial judge ignore or overrule this\ninformation and nonetheless proceed with the trial to judgment? The Court of\nAppeal answered that question in the negative in Mōsōla v R LAC (1970-1979)\n406 413. It held that the trial judge had no choice but to terminate the\nproceedings in the circumstances since the DPP was the supreme authority on the\nquestion whether a prosecution be discontinued or not as laid down in sec 8(5) of\nthe Criminal Procedure and Evidence Proclamation 59 of 1938. As the dominant\nlitigant, the DPP had the power to withdraw a charge at any stage of the\nproceedings and no court can prevent him or her from doing so, just as no court\ncan force him or her to prosecute. \n121 [1990] LSHC 44 (27 June 1990). This same judgment of Cullinan CJ is also\npresented in LESLII as [1990] LSCA 105 (27 June 1990) (Moloi).\n122 Moloi (n 121 above) 12; RW Lee ‘Malicious prosecution in Roman-Dutch law’\n(1912) 29 South African Law Journal 22.\n', '158                                                             (2017) 17 AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\npart of the defendant and of the absence of reasonable and probable\ncause.123 In particular, mention was made of the elements of\nmalicious prosecution, as was stated by Wessels JA in Moaki v Reckitt &\nColman (Africa) Ltd,124 and the fact that it had been established in\nHart v Cohen125 and Lemue v Zwartbooi126 that the plaintiff’s remedy\nwas provided by the actio iniuriarum and, therefore, he or she must\nallege and prove that the defendant intended to injure him or her –\nconstituting either dolus directus or dolus indirectus.127 Finally, the\ncourt adopted the above-mentioned four elements which a plaintiff\nmust prove, as was stated by Jansen JA in Lederman v Moharal\nInvestments Ltd.128 \nCullinan CJ held that the ‘first requisite’ clearly showed that the\nproceedings had been instituted by the Public Prosecutor, singled out\nby the plaintiff in the pleadings, who was acting under the powers\ndelegated to him by the DPP under section 6 of the CPEA.129 \nIt is the third requisite which apparently needs to be stated ‘in a mould\nmore consistent with the terminology’ of the actio iniuriarum. I think it\nsufficient to then simply say that the plaintiff must prove that the\ndefendant acted animo iniuriandi. \nTo that extent, where a defendant has acted without reasonable and\nprobable cause, it does not necessarily imply that he acted animo\niniuriandi as well, notwithstanding the fact that the want of reasonable\nand probable cause might at the trial afford evidence of the fact that\nhe acted animo iniuriandi. Similarly, proof of want of reasonable and\nprobable cause does not cast upon a defendant the onus of proving\nthat he did not act animo iniuriandi.130 Although there was no express\naverment that the prosecutor acted animo iniuriandi, as was stated in\nMoaki,131 where the implication of dolus necessarily flows from the\nother averments in the pleadings, that would be sufficient.

These principles apply to the institution of legal\nproceedings generally in Lesotho, for it was held in Gupta v Holy Names High\nSchool LAC (1970-1979) 129 138C-G that where legal rights have been infringed,\nthe injured party is entitled to set the law in motion against the party who caused\nthe infringement without incurring liability; but when this is done without\njustification in fact and with intent to injure, he commits an injury for which he is\nliable in damages. The institution of legal proceedings is justified when there is a\nreasonable and probable cause for its institution, which means an honest belief\nfounded on reasonable grounds that the institution of civil proceedings was\njustified. The actio iniuriarum is the remedy of a person who claims that he has\nbeen injured in this way. Where relief is claimed by this action, the plaintiff must\nprove that the defendant had the requisite direct or indirect intention to injure. \n128 1969 (1) SA 190 (AD) 196.\n129 Moloi (n 121 above) 20.\n130 Moloi 21 adopting per Wessels JA in Moaki (n 124 above) 105 & 106.\n131 Moaki (n 124 above) 104.

From this, the implication that the public\nprosecutor acted animo iniuriandi flows.\nIn respect of the absence of reasonable and probable cause, the\nChief Justice held that, while the public prosecutor’s interpretation of\nthe particular passage in Gardiner and Lansdown132 was incorrect,\nthis nonetheless did not affect the plaintiff’s liability in the matter, and\nthe prosecutor’s view of such liability was correct. It may be said that\na difficult question of law was involved here, and it was not evidence\nof absence of reasonable and probable cause that a mistake has been\nmade as to such question.133 It was held that there was no evidence\nbefore the court that the prosecutor himself did not believe in the\nplaintiff’s guilt. Indeed, he testified that he had intended to make\nsubmissions on the law to the learned trial magistrate, but was given\nno opportunity to do so. As the record indicated the magistrate ‘quite\nirregularly’ entered a verdict without reasons and without calling for\nsubmissions. Had the proceedings been handled otherwise, it would\nhave been clear that the information before the prosecutor, in all the\ncircumstances, was of such a nature as to lead a reasonable person to\nconclude that the plaintiff was probably guilty. The plaintiff, therefore,\nfailed to prove want of reasonable and probable cause.134 Cullinan CJ\nconcluded his judgment in Moloi by saying the following:135\nIn any event, as to whether or not the prosecutor acted animo iniuriandi,\nthere are two items of evidence which in any way give rise to that aspect.\nThe plaintiff is a well-to-do and well-known businessman. The public\nprosecutor testified that he knew of the plaintiff, but did not know him\npersonally, that is, before the prosecution. There is the aspect that he knew\nof the relationship of the police woman to the plaintiff, but that might well\nbe consistent with the remainder of his evidence … Even if the prosecutor\ndid not tell the truth in the matter … that [did] not necessarily indicate an\nintent to injure the plaintiff. The only evidence which could be remotely\nindicative of any such intention is the aspect that the prosecutor has\ncharge of a further possible prosecution against the plaintiff, that is, in\nrespect of an allegation of occupying land without proper authority,\ncontrary to section 87(1) of the Land Act. No charge had been preferred,\nhowever, and it was the prosecutor’s position that he had taken\ninstructions from the Director of Public Prosecutions in the matter. In all the\ncircumstances, I cannot say that such evidence establishes that the\nprosecutor probably intended to injure the plaintiff. \nThe question in Director of Public Prosecutions v Mofubetsoane136 was\nwhether the respondent had succeeded in proving ownership of the\nvehicle, the robbery of which he had been justifiably prosecuted for,\neven though the prosecution was abortive. The fact that the vehicle at\none time had been registered in the respondent’s name did not\nmaterially advance his case. There were many ways in which\n132 South African criminal law and procedure (1957) 1125.\n133 Moloi (n 121 above) 30; Phillips v Naylor (1859) 4 H & N 565.\n134 Moloi 31.\n135 Moloi 31-32.\n136 LAC (2009-2010) 79.\n', '160                                                             (2017) 17 AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\nregistration could be achieved without proper proof of ownership.\nThere were no probabilities that favoured his evidence as against that\nof the other witnesses, who gave more compelling evidence including\nconvincing documentation and corroborating evidence.137 The Court\nof Appeal held that his claim for the return of the vehicle or damages\nin lieu thereof should have been dismissed by the trial court and that,\nin order to establish a claim for malicious arrest, detention and\nprosecution, it would have been necessary for the claimant to prove,\ninter alia, that the police in arresting, detaining and causing him to be\nprosecuted, acted without reasonable and probable cause and with\nmalice (or animo iniuriandi).138 However, on the information available\nat the time to the police and the prosecuting authorities, the decision\nto prosecute the claimant could not have been unreasonable or\ntainted by impropriety. There was no proof of malicious conduct on\nthe part of the arrestors nor on the part of those concerned.139\nThe plaintiff in Kalaile v Commissioner of Police140 was arrested by\nthe police for having committed an offence in contravention of\nsection 70(6)(j)(10) of the Road Traffic Act 1981. Apparently without\nintroducing themselves, the police officers, who were not in uniform,\ntook the plaintiff’s cellular phone and his car keys, leaving his taxi\nwhere it was, unattended. Riding in their car, the officers, at some\npoint, wanted to release the plaintiff but the latter refused, whereafter\nthey rearrested him, took him to their station and locked him up from\n29 to 31 March 2009 when he was eventually brought to court and\nwas acquitted. Since the lawfulness or otherwise of the arrest and\ndetention in this case has been discussed earlier, all that is necessary\nto ascertain here is the trial court’s judgment on the malicious\nprosecution aspect of this case. \nChaka-Makhooane J held that the plaintiff had shown that the\ndefendants had set the law in motion and that the criminal\nprosecution had ended in his acquittal. Therefore, the court had to\nconsider the elements of absence of reasonable and probable cause\nand malice. With regard to reasonable and probable cause, the judge\naccepted the popular South African judicial opinion that it means, in\nthe context of malicious prosecution, an honest belief founded on\nreasonable grounds that the institution of prosecution was justified,\nand that the concept had both subjective and objective elements.141\nIf the police had such an honest belief in the guilt of the plaintiff,\nwould they have been willing to let him go? This evidence cast doubt\non the reasonableness of their conduct. They claimed that the plaintiff\nhad parked his taxi in the road, yet they snatched his keys from the\n137 Mofubetsoane (n 136 above) para 12.\n138 Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs v Moleko 2009 (2) SACR 585 (SCA) para\n8.\n139 Mofubetsoane (n 136 above) para 13.\n140 [2011] LSHC 130 (20 September 2011).\n141 Kalaile (n 11 above) para 21.

The judge held that this was not the conduct of an objectivelyreasonable\nperson who ought to use ordinary care and prudence.142\nBy leaving the vehicle in an obstructive state, the defendants failed to\nobjectively exercise reasonable measures as would be expected of\npolice officers in their situation and, thus, the plaintiff succeeded in\ndischarging the onus of proving absence of reasonable and probable\ncause. It was further held that the police officers had been intent on\nprosecuting the plaintiff knowing that it would in all probability injure\nhis good name. They foresaw that the course of prosecuting the\nplaintiff was wrong, but they persisted in order to ‘nail’ him for daring\nto refuse to accept his keys and cellular phone. Thus, the detention\nand prosecution followed in spite of the possibility that they were\nacting wrongly. The officers as servants of the defendants acted with\nmalice which, in the context of the animo iniuriandi, means not only\nthe intention to injure, but also the consciousness of wrongfulness.143\nThe plaintiff was also successful in proving that the defendants had\nacted maliciously.144 \n6 Conclusion\nAs is the case with courts in other parts of the Commonwealth, there\nis no doubt that the courts in Lesotho regard the right to personal\nliberty as one of the most fundamental of all constitutionallyentrenched\nrights. They have said this in so many words, and have\nstriven to demonstrate in the many cases reviewed in the article their\ndisapproval of numerous deprivations of this right every time they\nhave had the opportunity to do so. They have pronounced on cases\nwhere persons have been arrested unlawfully, detained without\nreasonable suspicion and prosecuted without reasonable or probable\ncause, as well as maliciously. The courts have described the excesses\nof the police and military personnel as the ‘sub-culture of brutality and\ninhuman treatment’, as in Kopo and Kopo v Commander LDF145 and\nJobo & Others v Commander, Lesotho Defence Force & Others,146 and as\n‘barbaric’ and ‘disgraceful’ with reference to the treatment meted out\nto the plaintiff in Mohlaba.147 The courts, from time to time, have\nbeen called upon to adjudicate over acts of indignity perpetrated\nagainst alleged criminal offenders who, more often than not, turned\n142 Kalaile para 24. See also Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs v Moleko 2009\n(2) SACR 585 (SCA) para 20.\n143 Prinsloo v Newman (n 141 above).\n144 Kalaile (n 11 above) paras 25-26.\n145 Kopo and Kopo (n 78 above). \n146 Jobo (n 46 above).\n147 Mohlaba (n 75 above) 191G & J.\n', '162                                                             (2017) 17 AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW JOURNAL\nout not to have been linked to any offence, or in any way broken the\nlaw.148\nGiven the frequent occurrence of acts of torture perpetrated on\narrested and detained persons in Lesotho, it appears that the time has\ncome for the government of the Kingdom to honour her international\nobligations by considering translating into her domestic law the\nprovisions of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,149 by enacting a\ncomprehensive law to curb torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading\ntreatment and all its ramifications. It is one thing to ratify a\nconvention and another to reduce its contents into municipal\nlegislation150 in order to make its contents enforceable in the\nmunicipal courts. Even though section 8 of the Constitution of\nLesotho guarantees everyone the right not to be tortured, inhumanly\nor degradingly treated, it would appear that this is not enough to\nrestrain the Lesotho military and the police from perpetrating such\nacts of inherent indignity on human beings at their whims and\ncaprices. Apart from enacting a law to define the various acts of\ntorture, to prohibit, prevent and combat torture and other offences\nassociated with the torture of persons, and to impose adequate\npunishment against offenders, there is one very important aspect of\nthe Convention which Lesotho must start implementing forthwith.\nThis is the requirement embedded in article 10, which enjoins state\nparties to151 \nensure that education and information regarding the prohibition against\ntorture are fully included in the training of law enforcement personnel, civil\nor military, medical personnel, public officials and other persons who may\nbe involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment of any individual\nsubject to any form of arrest, detention and imprisonment. \nIt is clear from the case law that the military personnel and law\nenforcement agents in Lesotho, by their conduct, have displayed\nabysmal knowledge of the constitutional prohibition of torture. Even if\nthey have been trained in terms of article 10, it is evident that they\nhave not been properly schooled and should be taught again and\nagain to respect the right to human dignity of the individual. \n148 Eg Morobi (n 88 above).\n149 Adopted by the UN on 10 December 1984 and entered into force on 26 June\n1987.\n150 Compare the Prevention and Combating of Torture of Persons Act 13 of 2013\n(RSA). \n151 A Commission of Inquiry into Public Disturbances 1998 131 also recommended ‘a\ncomprehensive retraining programme for police and army personnel’ in order to\nachieve ‘a gradual phasing out of persons who are unsuitable, particularly having\nregard to the need for a professional and a political army and police force’. \n']</pre>
