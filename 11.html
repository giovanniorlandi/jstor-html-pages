In\nfact, the latter part of the game saw\nOcala\'s smallest subs in the fight and\nthose small; subs had the pep and\nfight of regular giants.\nf Sanford played under somewhat of\nA disadvantage in the . second half.\nDaring the! first few minutes of play\nin this half, McLucas, the Sanford\ncaptain and. quarterback, was put out\nof the game with a badly sprained\nankle. This not only weakened the\nvisiting team physically, but dimin\nished their brain power to a great ex\ntent. - m\nSpecial mention should be made of\nthe playing of many of the Ocala\nboys. The line was impregnable. L.\nTroxler and Stevens played a game\nthat , was outstanding in noteworthi\nness. The other members of the line\nheld like a stone wall. Borland and\nFielding on the two ends played a\ngreat game. , Fielding and Williams\nespecially were noticed in almost ev\nery play and were there with the\ngoods when it came to breaking up\nthe Sanford plays behind the line of\nscrimmage and in breaking up for\nward passes.\nOcala\'s back field hit the line like\nmissiles from a 12-inch gun. Rawls,\nHaft, Knight, and Blowers were always\ngood for from three to ten yards thru\nthe lihe Smith never f ailed to make\nfrom\' 10 to 60 yards when called upon\nf or his fast runs and open field\nwork. , Smith was the Jbearer of the\nball in each of the four touchdowns\nand, snowed the fastest work in yes\nterday\'s game. Ocala\'s plan of at\ntack was through the line and end\nruns, resorting only one time to the\naerial attack. Sanford used the for\nward pass chiefly and was successful\nin a fake end run down the side line\nof he field.\nThe play went as follows:\nT First Quarter\nt: Ocala kicked off. Sanford brought\nthe ball back to the 25-yard line, and\nattempted a forward pass and a line\nbuck without gain. Sanford made five\nyards through the line and failed to\nmake the other five yards, the ball\nging over t Ocala. Smith and Knight\neach went through the line for six and\nten yards. Smith took the ball\naround the end for a 25-yard run and\ntouchdown. No goal. Ocala, 6; San\nford, 0. Ocala again kicked off and\nSanford received the ball on her 30\nyard line. On her first down Sanford\nfumbled and Ocala recovered the ball.\nOcala was held for downs, failing to\ngain through three line bucks and an\nattempted forward pass. Sanford\nlook the ball and for the only time\nduring the whole game seemed to\nthreaten Ocala\'s defense. On the\nfirst down she made 15 yards down\nthe side line. On the next down she\nmade three yards on a line buck.\nNext she completed a forward pass\nfor 25 yards. Made the fake side line\nrun again for 20 yards but this time\nOcala wa& getting wise to their for\nward passes and stopped two at\ntempts. Then Sanford tried two plays\nthrbugh this line but they might just\nas well have bucked a brick wall and\nthe ball went over to Ocala. In break\ning up these forward passes Knight\nand Fielding and Williams seemed to\nhave an intuition that showed them\njust where to be at the crucial mo\nment. Ocala ran Smith for 25 yards\naround right end, Williams went thru\nthe line for six yards and Knight thru\nthe line for six yards when the first\nquarter ended.\n? Second Quarter\n; Ocala fumbled the ball on her first\ndown and Sanford recovered it. Will\niams intercepted a forward pass and\n, brought the ball back a few yards. On\nthe first down Smith made five yards.\nWilliams made seven yards over, the\ntackle. Smith made 10 yards through\nthe line, then Ocala was penalized five\nyards for being off side. Hall made\nnine yards over center and Smith\nmade another four yards through the\nline. Ocalta was again held for\n. downs and had to kick because she\nwas off side on the first down and had\n15 yards ito go on the second. They\nfailed to grain on the second and had\n15 to go cm the third. They lost one\nConvict Gangs Coming this Week\nfrom Putnam and Volusia Coun\nties to Stanton, to Occupy\nTheir New Camp\nThe Star is reliably informed that\nthe two convict gangs expected from\nPutnam and Volusia counties, to be\ngin work on state road No. 2, begin\nning at the Lake county line, will ar\nrive at their new camp near Stanton\nsome time this week.\nyard on the third and kicked on the\nfourth. Sanford recovered the ball\nbehind her goal line and it was\nbrought out to their 20-yard line. San\nford gained one yard on her first\ndown, six yards on the second, but;\nStevens intercepted a short forward\npass on her third and brought the ball\nback several yards. Smith made one\nyard through the line. Williams\nmade three yards. Smith failed to\ngain so it was necessary to kick. San\nford came brck 10 yards with the ball\nwnen nail tnrew nis . man witn a\nbeautiful tackle. Sanford made two\nattempts with no gain. The second\ndown gave Knight an opening for a\nwonderful tackle. Williams broke up\na forward pass on the third down so\nthey kicked on the fourth. Hall re\nceived the ball and brought it back\nfive yards. Smith made a nine-yard\ngain on the first down and the whis\ntie blew for the. first half.\nThird Quarter\nSanford kicked off and Williams\nreceived the ball, carrying it back 15\nyards. On the first down Ocala sent\nSmith around the end for . 20 yards.\nWilliams made six yards through the\nline. Knight made two yards, but\nthen Sanford held for the next two\ndowns and the ball went over. San\nford made two yards in the first and\ntwo yards in . the second down and\nthen McLucas was Kurt and put out\nof the game. They made six yards on\na fake in the next down. They then\nfailed to make their distance and the\nball went over to Ocala. From then\non Ocala had things going her own\nway. On the first down Smith made\na 50-yard end run for a touchdown.\nNo goal. Ocala kicked off and San\nford brought the ball back 10 yards.\nOn the first down Sanford gained two\nyards but lost seven yards on the secr\nond when Fielding broke through the\ninterference and threw the man with\nthe ball. The third down was an in\ncompleted forward pass and the\nfourth was a punt. Ocala received\nthe ball and made a small gain before\nbeing downed. Williams gained four\nyards on first down. The second down\ngained one yard. Smith went thru\nthe line for six yards on the third.\nKnight gained seven through the line\nand Williams carried the ball the\nother three. Smith made another end\nrun for the third touchdown, and\nkicked the goal. Ocala, 19; Sanford, 0.\nFourth Quarter\nOcala began using her subs in the\nfourth quarter. Rawls replaced\nKnight and Blowers replaced Hall.\nStroup, Harold" and Ferguson went in\nthe line. Simmons and Drake took\nthe ends during this quarter. Ocala\nkicked off and Sanford was downed\non her 30-yard line. Ocala held her\nfor downs and after they had failed\ncn three line plunges and had made\nan attempt at a forward pass.

If the strike is called, the in\ndications today are that the strikers\nmay find themselves without any\ndirecting leaders. As the board has\nsummoned general chairmen of the\nunions to Chicago, a prolonged hear\ning would leave the locals without\nleaders.

The best markets for Florida\nbeef are right in Florida, if the peo\nple would get that notion in their\nheads. We are always trying to buy\nsomething outside of the state and\nthe same holds true of our best beef\nand pork and other meats. If a hotel\nwants chickens or turkeys or ducks,\nthey usually get cold storage stuff\nwhen they could just as well use the\nheme grown. The cattle men of\nFlorida are not worrying about the\ncattle business half as much as some\nother people. The cattle men are not\nasking for any aid from any outside\nparties and they seem to be doing\nvery well and if the specimens of\nFlorida beef brought into the markets\nhere in Sanford are an example, the\ncattle seem to be doing very welL\nAnd if there is no market for Florida\nbeef at present, neither is there any\nmarket for the beef of the great west\nand southwest, and the cattle men of\nthose great beef countries are having\njust as hard a time as the cattle men\nof Florida and much worse. They\nare calling for money and asking for\nhelp and wailing and gnashing their\nteeth over the cattle question and\nthe ticks do not seem to enter into\nthe argument at all. We do not see\nwhere this knocking of the Florida\nbeef will get us anywhere, and this\nnewspaper, that has always been an\nadvocate of fence laws and tick laws,\nthinks that a more systematic cam\npaign could be made for the sale of\nFlorida meats than such a campaign\nof knocks to be made againts the\nFlorida Leef.\nEarl McKey, a young white man,\nwar arrested Saturday by Deputy\nSheriff SheHeld, on the charge of\ntaking unpermitted possession of &\npistol and cap which a traveling man\nleft the night before on the seat of\nan auto.

October 14. 1921,\nof the presidents of nearly all the lead\ning railroads In the country. Mr. Thom\nas DeWitt Cuyler. chairman of the As\nsociation of Railway Executives, made\nthe following statement:\nAt a meetir; of the Association of\nRailway Executives today. It was de\ntermined by the railroads of the Unit\ned States, to seek to bring about a re\nduction In rates, and as a means to\nthat end to seek a reduction in pre\nent railroad wages, which have com\npelled maintenance of the present\nrate.\nAn application will be made Immedi\nately to the United States railroad la\nbor board for a reduction in wages of\ntrain service employee sufficient to\nremove the remainder of the lurretee\nmade by the labor board\'s decision of\nJuly 30. 1920 (which would involve a\nfurther redaction of approximately ten\nper cent), and for a reduction in the\nwages of all other classes of railroad\nlabor to the going rate for such labor\nIn several territories where the car\nrlere operate.\nTo Reduce Rates As Wages Go Down\nThe foregoing action Is upon the un\nderstanding that concurrently with\nsuch reduction In wages, the benefit\nof the reduction thus obtained shall,\nwith the concurrence of the interstate\ncommerce commission, be passed on to\nthe public in the reduction of exist\ning railroad rates, except in so far\nas this reduction shall have been made\nIn the meantime. The management\nhave decided upon this course in view\nof their realization of the fact that the\nwheels of industrial activity have been\n: closed down to a point which brings\ndepression and distress to the en; Ire\npublic and that something must be\ndone to start them again in opera\ntion. The situation which confronts the\nrailroads is extremely critical. The\nrailroads In 1920 realized a net rail\nway operating income of about $62,-\n00,000 upon a property investment of\nover 119,000.000,000 and even this\namount of $62,000,000 Included back\nmall pay for prior years received from\nthe government of approximately $64,\n000,000, thus showing, when the op\nerations of that year alone are con\nsidered, an actual deficit before mak\ning any allowance for either interest\nor dividends.\nThe year ended in serious depres\nsion in all branches of Industry, and\nIn marked reduction of the market de\nmand for and the prices of basic com\nmodities, resulting in a very serious\nfalling off in the volume of traffic.\nRoads Forced To Defer Maintenance\nIn this situation, a policy of the most\nrigid economy and of postponing and\ncutting to the bone the upkeep of the\nproperties was adopted by the rail\nroads. This was at the price of neg\nlecting and. for the time, deferring\nwork\' which must hereafter and, in\nthe near future, be done and paid for.\nThis is illustrated by the fact that.\nas of September 15, 1921, over 16 per\ncent, or 374,431 in number, of the\nfreight cars "of the carriers were in\nbad order and needing repairs, as\nagainst a normal of bad order cars of\nnot more than 160,000, as is further\nillustrated by the deferred and inade\nquate maintenance of other equipment\nand of roadway and structures.\nEven under those conditions, and\nwith this large bill charged up against\nthe future which must soon be pro\nTided for and paid if the carrier are\nto perform successfully, the transpor\ntation duties the result of operations\nfor the first eight months of this year.\nthe latest available figures, has been\nat a rate of net railway operating In\ncome, before providing for interest or\ndividends amounting to only 2.6 per\ncent per annum on the valuation of\nthe carrier properties made by the In\nterstate commerce commission In the\nrecent rate case, an amount not suffi\ncient to pay the Interest on their out\nstanding bonds.\nRoads\' Earnings Far Below Reasonable\nReturns.\nIt is manifest, from this showing, that\nthe rate of return of 5 12 or 6 per\ncent, for the first two years after\nMarch 1, 1920, fixed in the transporta\ntion act as a minimum reasonable re\nturn upon railroad Investment has not\nbeen even approximated much less\nreached; and that the present high\nrates accordingly are not due to any\nstatutory guarantee of earnings, for\n.there is no such guarantee.\nIn analyzing the expenses which have\nlargely brought about this situation. It\nbecomes evident that by far the largest\ncontributing cause is the labor cost.\nToday the railroads pay out to labor\napproximately 60c on the dollar they\nreceive for transportation services,\nwhereas in 1916, 40 cents on th dol\nlar, went to labor.\nOn the first day of January, 1917,\nwhen the government took charge of\nwages through the Adamson act, the\nlabor cost of the railroads had not ex\nceeded the sum of about $1,468,000,000\nannually. In 1920, when governmental\nauthority made the last wage increase,\nthe labor cost of the railroads was\nabout $3,698,000,000 annually, or, if\ncontinued thruout the year, instead of\nfor the eight months during which the\nwage increases were in effect, the la\nbor cost, on an annual basis, would\nhave been largely $3,900,000 an in\ncrease, since the government took\nSugar cookies, oatmeal cookies, ap\nple and peach pies, cocoanut layer\ncakes, the best you ever ate, at the\nFederal Bakery. 21-6t\nW.

Court Pharmacy. 14-6t\nbarge of railroad wages in the Adam\nson act. of approximately $2,450,000\n000 annually.\nIn the light of these figures. It is\nmanifest that the recent reduction of\nwages authorized by the labor board,\nestimated at from 10 to 12 per cent. In\nno sense meets or solves the problem\nof labor costs, and In no way makes it\npossible for the railroads to afford\na reduction of their revenue.\nThousands Of Rates Already Reduced\nIndeed, during the past year there\nhave been between four and five thou\nsand individual reductions In freight\nrates. \' On some railroads .the reduc\ntions in rates have amounted to mora\nthan the reductions In wages so far\nmade, and on many other railroads the\nreductions In wages allowed no net\nreturn on operations, but merely pro\nvided against the further accumula\ntion of a deficit.\nThe point is often made that agricul\nture and other industries are alao suf\nfering the same immediate difficulties\nas the railroads. Why, therefore, do\nnot the railroads take their medicine\nlike anybody else? The answer lies\nIn several facts:\n1. The railroads were not permitted,\nas were other Industries, to make\ncharges during the years of prosper\nity, making possible the accumulation\nent extreme adversity. According to\nthe reports of the Interstate commerce\ncommission, the rate of return in prop\nerty investment of the railroads of the\nUnited States for the past several years\nhas been as follows:\n"RATE OF RETURN EARNED\nBY RAILROADS OF THE\nUNITED STATES ON\nTHEIR PROPERTY\nINVESTMENT."\n1912\n1913\n1914\n1915\n4.84\n5.15\n4.17\n4.20\n5.90\n6.16\n5.26\n3.61\n2.46\n0.32\n1916 (fiscal year)\n1916 (calendar year).\n1917\n1918 .\n1919\n1920\nIt will thus be noted that during the\nyears when other Industries were mak\ning very large profits, when the prices\nof farm products and the wages of la\nbor were soaring to unheard-of heights,\nthe earnings upon railroad investment\nin the United States were held within\nvery narrow limits and that they have\nduring the past four years progressive\nly declined.\nRoads Handicapped More Than Other\nBusiness.\n2. The railroads are responsible to\nthe public for providing adequate trans\nportation. Their charges are limited\nby public authority, and they are, in\nvery large respects (notably for labor)\ncompelled to spend money on a basis\nfixed by public authority. The margin\nwithin which they are permitted to\nearn a return upon their investment\nor to offer Inducements to attract new\ncapital for extensions and betterments\nIs extremely limited. However much\nthe railroads might desire, therefore,\nto reduce their charges in times of de\npression, it will be perceived that the\nlimitations surrounding their action do\nnot permit them to give effect to broad\nand elastic policies which might very\nproperly govern other lines of business\nnot thus restricted.\nIt has been urged upon the railroads\nthat a reduction in rates will stimu\nlate traffic and that Increased traffic\nwill protect the carriers from the loss\nincident to a reduction In rates. The\nrailroad managements cannot disguise\nfrom themselves that this suggestion is\nmerely conjectural and that an ad\nverse result of the experiment would\nbe disastrous not only to the railroads,\nbut to the public, whose supreme need\nis adequate transportation.\nConsequently the railroad manage\nments cannot feel justified in placing\nthese instrumentalities, so essential to\nthe public welfare, at the hazard of\nsuch an experiment based solely upon\nsuch a conjecture.\nFarmers Especially Need Lower Rates\nIt Is evident, however, that existing\ntransportation charges bear In many\ncases a disproportionate relationship to\nthe prices at which commodities can\nbe sold in the market and that exist\ning labor and other costs of transpor\ntation thus imposed upon industry\nand agriculture generally a burden\ngreater than they should bear. This\nis especially true of agriculture. The\nrailroad managements are feeling sen\nsitive to and sympathetic with the dis\ntressing situation and desire to do\neverything to assist In relieving it that\nis compatible with their duty to fur\nnish the transportation which the pub\nlic must have.\nAt the moment railroads, in many\ncases .are paying 40 cents an hour for\nunskilled labor, when similar labor is\nworking alongside the railroads and\ncan easily be obtained by them at 20\ncents an hour. The railroads of the\ncountry paid, in 1920v a total of con\nsiderably over $1,300,000,000 to unskill\ned labor alone. However desirable it\nmay be to pay this or that schedule of\nwages, it is obvious that it cannot be\npaid out of railroad earnings, unless\nthe Industries which use the railroads\nare capable of meeting such charges.\nThe railroads and through them,\nthe people generally are also ham\npered in their efforts to economize by\na schedule of wording rules and con\nditions now in force as a heritage from\ntha ncrinH nt federal control and up\nheld by the railroad labor board. These\nconditions are expensive, uneconomic\nand unnecessary from the point of view\nof railroad operation ana eiiremeij\nhiiT-rionanme unon the tmblic which\nnavs the bill. This schedule of wages\nminf wnrkine conditions prevents the\nrailroads from dealing equitably with\nthr labor costs in accordance with\nrapidly changing conditions and the\ntreat variety oi locai ronstuemuons\nwhich ought to control wages in ait\nfprnt narts of the country. The rail\nroads are seeking to have these rules\nand working conditions abrogated.\nThe railroads will seek a reduction\nin wares now nroDosed by first reauest-\ntag the sanction of the railroad labor\nboard, rne rauroaas win proceeo witn\nall possible dispatch.\' and as soon as\nthe railroad labor board shall have giv\n- ! general reduction la rates will be\'\nen Its assent to tne reduction or wages.\npat Into effect.\nIT THREATENS TO\nSHOW THEM UP\n(Palatka News)\nWe hope before the 2Sth of this\nmonth to further establish the causes\nfor the interference with the opera\ntion of the O.

He was get\nting so popular that she had to be\nready for callers every day. Would he\nlike her to keep George Sewall for\ndinner, when they could play dominoes\nagain?. Would he like the table with\nthe picture puzzle? He would like\nJust to talk? Very well; they would\ntalk.\nMartin\'s day was so filled and\ndivided with small pleasures that it\nwas apt to amaze him by passing too\nquickly. He had special breakfasts,\nhe had his paper, bis hair was brushed\nend his bed remade a dozen times a\nday. Cherry shared her mall, which\nwas always heavy now, with him ; she\nflitted into the sick-room every few\nminutes with small messages or gifts.\nWith her bare, bright head, her busy\nwhite hands, her voice all motherly\namusement and sympathy and sweet\nness, she had never seemed so much\na wife. She had the pleasantest laugh\nIn the world, and she often laughed.\nThe sick-room was kept with exquisite\nsimplicity, with such freshness, bare\nness, and order as made it a place of\ndelight. One day Cherry brought home\na great Vlkory bowl of silvery glass,\nand a dozen drifting goldfish, and Mar\ntin never tired of watching them Idly\nwhile he listened to her reading.\n"Cherry, Peter said, on a wet Janu\nary day, when he came upon her In the\ndining room, contentedly arranging a\nfragrant mass of wet violets, "I think\nMartin\'s out of the woods now. I be\nlieve I\'ll be moving along I"\n"Oh. but we \'want you always, Pe\nter!" she said. Innocently regretful.\nThe ghost of a pained smile flitted\nacross his face.\n"Thank you," he said, gently. "But\nI think I will go," he added, mildly.\nShe made no further protest.\n"But where?" she asked, sympa\nthetically. "1 don\'t know. I shall take Buck\nstart off toward the big mountains,\nril write you now and then, of course !\nI\'m going home, first!"\n"Just now," Cherry mused, sadly,\n"perhaps It Is best for you to get\naway ! Now that Martin is so much\nbetter," she added, in a little burst. "I\ndo feel so sorry for you, Peter! 1\nknow how you feel. I shall miss her\nalways, of course," said Cherry, "but\nI have him."\nI try not to think of her," Peter\nsaid, flinging up bis head.\n"When you do, Cherry said, earn\nestly, giving him more of her attention\nthan had been usual, of late, "Here Is\nsomething to think, Peter. It\'s this :\nwe have so much to be thankful for,\nbecause she never knew I It . was\nmadness," Cherry went on, eagerly,\n"sheer madness that is clear now. I\ndon\'t try to explain it, because it\'s all\nbeen washed away by the frightful\nthing that happened. I\'m different\nnow ; you\'re different I don\'t know\nhow we ever thought we could "\nThere was a silence during which\nshe looked at him anxiously, but the\nexpression on his face did not alter,\nand he did not speak.\n"And what I think we ought to be\nthankful for," she resumed, "is that\nAlix would rather she would rather\nhave it this way. She told me that\nshe would be heart-broken if there had\nbeen any actual separation between\nme and Martin, and how much worse\nthat would have been what we\nplanned, I mean. She was spared\nthat, and we were spared I see It\nnow what would have ruined both our\nlives. We were brought to our senses,\nand the awakening only came a little\nsooner than It would have come, any\nway 1"\nPeter had walked to the window,\nand was looking out at the shabby\nwinter trees that were dripping rain,\nand at the beaten garden, where the\ndrenched chrysanthemums had been\nbowed to the soaked earth.\n"Here, In Dad\'s home," Cherry said,\ncoming to stand beside him, "I see\nhow wicked and how mad I was. In\nanother, twenty-four hours it would\nhave been too late you don\'t know\nhow often I wake up In the night and\nshiver, thinking that I And as It la,\nI am here in the dear old house ; and\nMartin well, you can see that even\nMartin\'s life is going to be far happier\nthan it ever wasl It\'s such a joy t\nme," she added, with the radiant look\nshe often wore when her husband\'s\ncomfort was under consideration, "to\nfeel that we need never worry about\nthe money end of things there\'s\nenough for what we need forever!"\n"You must never worry about mon\ney," he told. her. "And If ever you\nneed It If it Is a question of a long\ntrip, or of more operations if there Is\nany chance "\n"I shall remember that I have a big\nbrother!" she said.\nThe room was scented by the sweet,\ndamy flowers, and br the sood odor\nor laziry ourmng logs; yet to reter\nthere was chill and desolateness in the\nair. Cherry took np the glass bowl in\nboth careful Lands, and went away In\nthe direction of the study, but he stood\nat the window for a long time staring\ndully out at the battered chrysanthe\nmums and the swishing branches, and\nthe steadily f alling rain.\nA few days later, on a day of un\ncertain sunshine and showers, Peter\nleft them. To Cherry Peter\'s going\nwas a relief; it burned one more\nbridge behind her. It confirmed her\nin the path she had chosen ; It was to\nher spirit like the cap that marks the\naccepted student nurse, or like the\nblack coif that replaces the postulant\'s\nwhite veil of probation.\nHe had been In the downstairs bed\nroom, talking with Martin, for per\nhaps an hour; he had drawn them a\nrough sketch of the little addition to\nthe house that Cherry meant some day\nto build next to the study, and he and\nMartin had been discussing the de\ntails. Cherry was sweeping the wet,\ndun-colored leaves from the old porch\nwhen a sudden step in the doorway be\nhind her made Ler look up.\nPeter had come out of the house,\nwith Buck beside him. He wore his\nold corduroy clothes and his shabby\ncap, but there was something In his\naspect that made her ask:\nNot going r\n"Yes.

After belts had\nbeen loosened a couple of times, and\nthe boys stopped eating of their own\naccord, and while the empty dishes\nwere being removed to make room for\nthe ice cream, cake and candy, Capt.\nTed Drake held the interest of the\nboys with stories of scouts, here and\nin England, during the war and in\npeace. His talk was interesting, in\nstructive and showed a broad knowl\nedge of scouts and scouting. Capt.\nDrake is at all times a most original\nand engaging conversationalist, and\nif the boys\' actions, attention and\ngeneral behavior are to count for\nanything, he was at his best on this\noccasion. Amid wild applause for\nCapt. Drake the desert was served,\nand after it was disposed of Rev. J.\nJ. Neighbour captured the boys\'\nhearts and souls with one of those\nelegant orations, combining useful\ninformation and humor for which he\nis becoming famous. His remarks\nwere creative and showed that to\n"achieve" you must "try," and while\nyou are trying and achieving, you can\nand should "enjoy."\nMr. Neighbour\'s talk was followed\nby a short scout meeting to award the\nbadges to the boys.\n, The boys\' part of the entertain\nment took the form of a shadow show\ncontest, of which Benny Culverhouse\nwas the winner, with Wilbur Gary a\nclose second. The contest furnished\nmany laughs and brought out a won\nderful store of ingenuity on the part\nof the contestants.\nDuring the evening the scout mas\nter took occasion to impress on the\nboys that Rev. J. J. Neighbour, Capt.\nTed Drake and Mr. R. N. Dosh were\nnot "visitors," but "scouts," and\nmembers of the troop. - The boys\nsaid they hoped they would come\nagain, soon and often, and that is the\nhighest praise that can be given any\none.\nIt\'s hard to say just where the fun\ndid stop, but all things come to an\nend, so only too soon the bedtime\nhour forced the gathering to break\nup, and one more happy and profi\ntable occasion passed into the list of\nmemories.\nSpecial thanks are due Mrs. Ed\nward Drake, Mrs. E. W. Clements,\nMrs. L. J. Knight, Mrs. W. T. Gary,\nMrs. Allen Becklehimer, Mrs. Thomas\nSexton and Mrs. Jennie Cassil. With\nout the co-operation of these good la\ndies, the banquet would have been\nimpossible.\nBEYOND COMPREHENSION.\n"A curious case came up in the court\nof domestic relations this, morning."\n"What was it all about?" asked the\nmeek little man.\n"A wife charged that her husband\ncut out the department store advertise\nments from the family newspaper be\nfore he\'d let her read It. He was a\nbrute, wasn\'t he?"\n"Certainly," replied the meek little\nman. "But what I don\'t understand is\nhow he managed to get hold of the\npaper first"\nHis Was That Kind.\n"Are you interested in a loose-leaf\nencyclopedia?"\n"Nope, got one.\n"Indeed I Whose?"\n"The Britannlca."\n"Didn\'t know they published a loose-\nleaf edition I"\n"You ought to see mine after the\nchildren had used the volumes as\nbuilding blocks a few years."\nA Strategist\n"Hiram," said Mrs. CorntosseL "why\ndid you Insist on our boy Josh takln\'\nmusic lessons? You know he hasn\'t\nany talent"\n"I wasn\'t thinkln\' about the talent\nAs long as I hear him practlcin on\nthe violin, I know he isn\'t skylarkin\'\nwith- the hired man nor teasln the\nstock."\nTalk about pre-war prices; $2 less\nth-n we have ever put them on. The\nOcala Wagon Works is patting Ford\ntops on for $10.50; roadsters, $9.00.\nOther cars in proportion. Prices sub\nject to chancre. 10-l-30t\nChiropractic is no longer a theory,\nbut a practical demonstrated fact.\nYou can be speedily restored to per\nfect health by having the cause of\nyour ailment removed.
