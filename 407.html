Eastern and Middle Western peo- 1, pie are expected to take kindly to the, innovation. They may spend the en, tire summer in tho open at little ex, pense., The deal for the sale of the Beatsou, mine on Latouche island fell through, because the proposed purchasers want, ed to pay only 10 per cent down aud, the remainder on easy installments, :, practically making it a long time op, tion which would have enabled the new, I owners to take all but the first pay, ment out of the mine and to drop the, property at any time they might be so j, disposed.

Tho executive, offices of the fair will probably be 1, moved to the grounds about September, I, An emergency hospital will be one of, the first buildings erected at the Alas- ,, ka-Yukon-Paciflc Exposition. While, tho construction work is going on work, men who are injured or taken sick will, be cared for, and during the Exposition, it will be used to take care of visitors 1, who become ill or are hurt., i, Tho official flag of the Alaska-Yukon- j, Pacific Exposition has been selected., The color scheme is red, white and blue., Five stars on a blue field stand for the, United States, Russia, France, England I, and Spain, the five countries which, first explored tho territory included in, the scope of tho Exposition.

Mrs. ,, Reed also arranged the official flag for, the Lewis and Clark Exposition., According to the reports of some of, the Koowuk natives, says the Point, Hope correspondent of the. Nome Nug, get, lyux are very fond of hawks, and, have their own methods of capturing, those birds. They dig a hole in the, snow and then crouch down in it, leav, ing only a small portion of their tail, exposed. The small stump of a tail is, then vigorously shaken. The hawk\'s, atteution is attracted, and, thinking it, has discovered a ptarmigan, it swoops, down and captures the tail. The lynx, then springs up and captures the hawk, before it has time to escape., The report that all work had stopped, on the Alaska Central R. R., seems to, be disputed by the following from a re, cent issue of the Seward Gateway:, Watson &, Snow will soon complete the, 120-foot truss across Placer river on the, railroad loop. This will be the second, Howe truss to be completed this spring, though it is the third on the line, being, on the backward turn of the loop. The, second on the line lies farther down j, the river. It will be a 90-foot span., Tracklaying has been delayed a few, days by a gravel slide in the deep cut, on mile 50, but will begin about next, Monday., -v Late reports from the Innoka are j, that nothing has been found so far, other than bar diggings. Some good, pans have been taken out, and the gen, eral appearauce of the country is good, from a prospector\'s standpoint. The, actual diggings are well into the moun, tains where rimrock shows and where, it is from 7 to 12 feet to bedrock. Nug- j, gets have been taken out weighing as !, high us 81G0, but the average pannings, do not show anything better than a :, little better than wages. The whole !, country is staked. Crowds of people I, have rushed there from surroundicg, camps and from Nome., Extensive coal mines will be operat, ed on Kachemak bay next year if pres, ent developments are continued and, the plans for handling a heavy output, are carried out. An output of 3,000 to, ^,000 tons a day next year is promised, by George W. Ross, head of the syndi, cate which has acquired a largo area of, coal lands along the bay. Hunkers will, be erected at Homer sutticient to load, a daily output of several thousand tons, besides storing enormous stocks. Mr., Koss expects to find hie chief market, in San Francisco. Ho says coal can be, hauled on barges to San Francisco for, ?1.50 a ton. The syndicate which is, working at Homer is composed of, Michigan coal men. This syndicate, has purchased all the property of the, old Cook Inlet Coal Company, which, opened mines in 1S99 and built a nar, row guage railroad about eight miles, long from Homer up the sands pit. The, company went into bankruptcy and its, property was sold under an order of, the United States district court of, West Virginia, in which state the com, pany was incorporated. From the pur, chaser at the bankrupt sale the proper, ty passed to James H. Caldwell, of, Pennsylvania, and from him to the, Koss syndicate. The property owned, by the old company included coal, lands, the railroad, rolling stock, ma, chinery and the towusite of Homer., The coal at Homer is of a good quality., It id taid to be of better grade than the, average coal mined in the state of, Washington. It is flrst-class heating, coal and in burning leaver few clinkers., Jack Hines, a former member of the, Nome Nugget\'s staff, has written that, paper some letters from New York, about people aud events iu the easteru, metropolis interesting to far northern -, ers ou account of their relation to mat, ters in Alaska. Here is an incident, re, lated in one of the letters that will, make good wi*h any hard-luck story of, the year:, "A few days ago Denny Blakely,, Harry Walters, George Borchsenins aud, myself were summoned to appear be, lore the stockholders of the old Alaska, Goid Mining Company. You remember, it ? Ed Waggaman\'8 proposition. We, sat on one side and the capitali.-ta on, the oihei ? the old colonel iu the mid, dle. He started off this way:, "Gentlemen, I\'ve asked you to come, hero aud speak before these gentlemen, the men who put up the money for my, exploiting in Alaska, and who say I, robbed them and did not at any time, act in good faith. Now, I\'ve not very, many years to live, and I waut this one, thing squared up before 1 die.\', "They had au attorney who quizzed, us each, separately, auent our knowl, edge of the old Alaska Gold Mining, Company\'s ground, which comprised, all of the beach lines back of Nome., We all told conservatively of the value, of that property, and when asked to, ballot an estimate of the possible cash, value the average of four guesses was -, seventy-three million dollars. Well,, sir, the old sports just wept to think, that a few thousands more would have, given them the bulk of this fortune., "The capitalists showed in many ways, their humiliation and only wanted some \', things to prove to the colonel that they, were ready to make good and back him, tor any amount."]', '[The Douglas Island News., Entered at Douglas Post-office as Second, Class Mall Matter., TERMS: -In Advance., One Year - - $3.00, Six Months ------- 1.50, Three Months ------ 75 1, Single Copies ------ 10 I, \'PHONE NO. 12., j, . I, Wednesday, July 10, 1007., CHARLES A. HOPP, Editor and Proprietor., PUBLISHED EVERY WEDNESDAY, I, ? ? 1, There appeared in the Juneau Daily, Record-Miner some time ago an article, which has brought out much favorable, comment. The writer urged that, as, the interests of the three towns on Gas, tineau Chanuel are the same, they, should be bound together by some, kind of an organization, the object of, which would be to further any scheme, to build up this section of the country., The project is a good one, and so many, of the business men aud others are in, terested that it only waits for the voice, of a leader and the thing is doue., One of the first things that should be, doue by such an organization is to so, thoroughly advertise this part of Alas, ka that the whole world will know its, possibilities. Make a noise. Shout it, from the hill tops in every land that, here we have a rich blessiug of nature, waiting for man to come and eujoy its, fullness. Let the men with money to, invest know that here is the chance j, they are looking for, and let the labor- ;, ing meu, the home-builders, know thai, here are opportunities for them as well. ?, Workers are already scarce in this sec- I, tion, but if the great projects that are, taking shape on both sides of the chan, nel are to be carried out, if the roar of, the 800 stamps at tho Treadwell is to, be echoed by a thousand or fifteen hun, dred across on the Sheep Creek side,, where are the workers? There are ma, ny, many ways in which such an organ- j, ization could help push things along,, and those of us who can not achieve, great things would be able to each do, his little part., Alaska T radition, The A!ieut9 have a tradition that at, one time the islands of Oonalasbka and, Oumnak were nearly covered with, "Are mountains" of various sizes. An, argument arose and they quarreled, among themselves as to which had the, largest body of fire within it., After a prolonged dispute in which, not one would yield to the others, it, was decided that the best way to settle, the question was by a trial of strength., A most fearful conflict ensued, which, lasted for many days. The mountains, thro.v fire and rocks at each other in, stead of spears. This contiuued until, the smaller peaks, recognizing that they i, could not withstand the conflict, bowed I, down in sorrow and went out forever., Finally only two of the craters re, mained, one at Oonalashka ? Makushin ;, (Ayak) ? and the other at Oumnak, the I, Rechesnia (Ismak). These having van, quished the others, engaged in a terri, ble single handed conflict, with the, most disastrous consequences to their, surroundings. Fire, rock and ashes, were thrown over the adjoining coun, try, the animals in the neighborhood, were all killed, and the air became, heavy with the gases., Oumnak crater finally realized that, it could continue the conflict no longer,, so gathering all its energy, it jumped, up with a great bound and collapsed., The Makushin volcano, being victor !, and but little injured, and seeing no, more competitors, quieted down and, now only smokes occasionally., "Has went."?

Seward has progressed furthest., The plans for the statute to John Jacob j, Astor, the founder of Astoria, Oregon, i, the first trading post on the Pacific, slope, aud to Ranald McDonald, the, first Americau trader to cross the Pa, cific, are still being worked upon, but, the preliminaries as regards the statue, to the father of Alaska, have all been, settled.

The qualifications of, Brooks acd Gilbert for the work are, admitted on all sides. Iu the case of, Brooks some of his work entitles him,, iu the estimation of members of the, committee, to a place in the front rank, of Americau sculptors; it has been fa, vorably received in the salons of Paris, j \', Among the statues turned^ from his j, hand is that of Thomas Gass, in the ], public gardens of Boston, recognized 1, as one of the masterpieces of American <, art. For this he was awarded a gold ;, medal at the Paris salon in 1800, first, class gold medal at the Paris exposition, in 1900, and similar recognition at the, Pari-American at Buffalo, in 1001.

A. Bauer of Seattle and Sitka on a, recent trip to Seattle brought with him !, a story of a newly discovered cave filled, with mummies. The cave is on a small, island of the Aleutian group ? evidently, a sacred isle ? where the ancients of the, northern races buried the great of their, nation. Chiefs, medicine men and j, witch charmers, as well as great warri, ors were embalmed and laid in the sea ?, cave where the dry air kept them for, ages undisturbed. It was the universal, belief among the Bering Sea Indians, that so long as the bodies of these war, riors were preserved from natural de, cay, their spirits hovered about the, tribe and fought off the evil spirits of, their hereditary enemies. There are, about fifty mummies in the cave from, which Bauer obtained the one now in, the city, and the best of these will be, selected by the commissioners of the, Exposition and will be brought to Se- !, attle and laid side by side with the, mummies of the kings who lived in, lower Egypt before the Parthenon had I, been built on its great hill, and before, the wolf that mothered the Roman Em, pire had wandered in the forest of the, Seven Hills., Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Ser, vices every Sunday at 8 p. m. at the, Lutheran New Church at the corner of, 3d and ? streets.
