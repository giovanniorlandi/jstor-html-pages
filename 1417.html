The Mary, Murphy, located just over the, county line to the east of us, has, produced ore up into the millions, and as yet the surface is little, more than ‘scratched.” Recent, reports state that the Golf tunnel i, which was driven from near the, bottom of the gu\'sh to get under, the old workings, at a point 4,5000, feet from portal cut the Mary, Murphy vein at a depth of 2,200 j, feet. The vein at this point is 16, feet wide and it is stated that the, values are much better than at ■, near the surface. At this depth j, also, the vein dips to the east or!, into the mountain, instead of to, the west as it does further up., MINER., CKKSTHL\' BUTTE. GUNNISON COUN TY. COLORADO.

The building 1, of this immense power plant on, Talyor river will mean great, things for Gunnison countv and, the eventual constructing of a rail, road from the\'Arkansas val\'ey in, ti Talyor park and over to the, big ccalfields of (Verted Butt?, and through to Somerset and, finally making it the main thro, ugh line to Salt Lake City and, the coast, shortening the distance, at least one hunhrrd miles from, Denver to G r and Junction and, avoiding the haul over Mars < al, | pass and Cero hill., BROADGAGING ?, ; The question of hroadgagirg the, Rio Grand railway line over, Marshall pass to Montrose, is, i again beingagitated by the public, press hut we fail to hear much a, : bout it from railway officials., There is no doubt hut what the, thing will have to be done some, time and that before long from, the fact that constantly increasing, business over this line will neces, sitate wianeriing the tracks tc ac, comodate the hauling of standard, \' gauge cars which have double the, capacity of those now in use. It, is expected that the large crops, raised the present year on the, | western slope country, will con, \'gest traffic over the little narrow, gauge lines this fall and winter, j which will occasion the loss to the, hav and cattle shippers of hun, dred of thousands of dollars, to, say nothing of the hundreds of, miners that will he thrown out of, emnloyment for the want of cars, needed to fill the coal orders, whichalway com? thick and fast, during the winter months for our, coal products. It is hoped that, this constant agitation will event, ually result in bringing into every, coal mining district in the west, ern slope, the standard gauge, tracks which is the main thing, now required to make this portion, of the state the most prosperous, of any., —————————, i ‘ PRO SPEO I’ING IN COLO.”, This booklet with maps, b y, ; Arthur Lukes, geolsgist. telln prn«-, pecturs wlmt they must know of, j geological conditions.

Something, to lioost and consant boostirg, tV“ things that make a town. In, asmuch as Crested Butte is sit, uated in a locality rich in the pcs, session of pracically inexhaustible, mineral depo-ite and land adapted, to varied agricultural pursuits, it, certainly has something to boost, Now it is up to the citizens of, Crested Butte to do boosting. 0"e, | of the first steps in that direction, is the adoption of a civie slogan, The slogans of some of our Ameri, can towns are almost as familiar j, as the names of the towns for in, stance one dty tells us to" Watch, us grow,” another by means of, its civic slogan tolis us that r is, the “City where Lifes worth liv, ing,” still another says to us, "Watch our smoke” implying, that there is something doing in, that town and making us wonder, what the reason i 3., The beauty of the adoption of a, civic motto isthat it costs nothing, but a little thought. And an ex, pressive motto if constantly used, does more to boost, than columns, lof lavish praise. It would appear, on the stationery and in the ad, vertising of the business men; it, would" ficeome identified with the, name of the town and would do, for Crested liuttc what the civic, slogans have done for hundreds, of other Ami rican tow\'no-it would, help to boost.

Dover, landing at Le Chatelet. a, little village two miles east of Cape, Cri* Nex. accomplishing the passage, in twenty-seven hours and thirty-five, ■Mautes. A motorboat accompanied, the swimmer. It is estimated that, Burgess, owing to the zigzag course, he was compelled to take because of, the baffling tides, covered sixty miles, la crossing the twenty-mile channel., Boon after the start a dense fog set, tled down over the channel and no, further tidings of his progress were, received ashore until the announce, ment was made that he had accomp, lished the task and landed in France., Throughout the trip Burgess was, faro red by a calm sea, but a strong, tide was running and a severe strain, was put on the swimmer to get past, the Goodwin sands. Twice he vs as at, tacked by sickness and several times, was only held to his task by the, Strongest will power and the encour, aging words of the men in the boat., Me remaiued on French soil just long, enough to telegraph word of his suc, cess to his wile and partake of re, freshments In a bathing bqx.

He wore a, •air of goggles and a rubber bathing, cap. A party of eleven accompanied, hiss in a motor-boat. Soon after the, atart the wind freshened, and the, •slumer had a nasty experience in a, lumpy sea. The water penetrated his, •aggies and first affected the right, wye. though finally both eyes became, Inflamed., By nightfall the wind had subsided, altogether and there was an oily calm, on the water. Burgesa had recovered, and was swimming powerfully. He, was bright and cheery, and from time, to time chatted with the men who, were in the boat., The next flood tide sent him right, t>ack toward England over the dread, ful ridge shoal, where he noticed, the chill of shallow water. He asked, that soundings be taken, and it was, found that the depth was twenty-one, fathoms. He concluded that it was, nearer England than France.

This company, has purchased some fifty mining prop, erties, all In one group, located on, South Boulder creek between Rollins, vllle and Tolland., One of the most important strikes, made in the Cripple Creek district this, year Is reported by A T Rankin* a, pioneer mining man of the state, who, has opened a vein at grass roots on, the Fair Chance claim, on the west, slope of Gold hill, ore from which as, says of 117 to 200 ounces silver and, $8 to S2O gold per ton., The new ore body recently opened, by Matha and associates in the Phar, macist property on Bull hill. Cripple, Creek, is steadily developing, the vein, being followed showing increased di, mensions with values gradually im, proving. This shoot, encountered at a, depth of 200 feet in the main shaft is, now exposed to a width of four feet,, and assays returned high values., A steady production Is being main, tained from the Hubert mine in No, vadavllle. Ten stamps are dropping, steadily at the U. I*. R. mill on mill, ore being mined from a new vein, that has been opened up on the 600-, foot level, between the north and, south vein, which has an average, width of three feet of smelting and, milling ore. A clean-up is made at, the mill twice during each week and, is averaging forty ounces to the clean, up. A shipment of eight toils of rmelt, ing ore was also made from this- vein,, which yielded 1.50 ounces gold and, 6.70 ounces silver to the ton., William Couch, who is operating, the Golden Gate tunnel on Quartz, hill. In Gilpin County, expects any, round now will break into the Bax, ter lode. This is a cross-cut tunnel, and In a distance of ninety-four feet,, and will be driven ahead to connect, with a shaft that has been sunk fur, ther up the hill, from which good ore, has been extracted, from an eighteen, inch streak, with values of an ounce, to the ton. Surface quartz was also, extracted from the lode, worth S2OO a, ton. A depth of about 200 feet will, be gained by this tunnel. The prop, erty Is located east of the 4th of July, and Columbia Tunnel mines., The strike made recently in the, Cumberland property, Ouray, is hold, ing up well. The vein is eight feet, wide, carrying lead, gray copper and, gold., Without a question, the TopekA, vein, in Gilpin County, will now be, enriched the deeper the mine Is sunk., The bottom of the shaft at its pres, ent depth of 1,500 feet has entered in, to the richest section of Leavenworth, gulch, and entering into Quartz hill,, and with in a few hundred feet of the, bottom of the mine, are the Wood,, Kirk and German mines, celebrated, for their production of uranium ore., one of the most precious metals ex, tracted from the ground, and practi, cally the only mines producing the, metal in quantity in the United, States. There\' is every likelihood of, the Topeka coming into this ore at, its present depth and enhancing the, value of the property materially. The, ore chute from which this rich ore is, being extracted has been opened for, 300 feet in length, with ten Inches of, smelting, carrying high values as it, has been opened up. The mill ore, measures three feet in width with an, average value of $13.25 to the ton., Manager F. L. Patrick has opened, the ore body of the Dorit mine *n the, deep tunnel level, Idaho Springs, and, has one of the best streaks of ore, ever shown in the mine. Assays have, not yet been taken, but it is assured, that the material is the same as that, already tested which carrlee values, of sixteen ounces gold and 120 ounces, silver per ton, a total of nearly S4OO., The ore was found on the wall at, about the point where surveys Indi, cated that It should be and therefore, it may be assumed that the streak Is, oontinuous to the workings above., WHY BE WEAK?, Why suffer backache, b«at«c>a, llwlnaaa. weariness, urinary Irragn, larltlaa and other tronblaa that artaa, from dlaordarad kidney,?
