Several speakers said this year’s\ncrop is smaller than last year, but that\ndiversified farming hud made up for the\nsmaller cotton acreage by giving the\nfarmer a larger supply of food products\nto market. D. J. Neill, State president\nof the Texas branch of the union, said\nthere is danger that the cotton crop of\nthe coast region of Texas will be totally\ndestroyed by the boll weevil. G. E. Lee.\nGeorgia State president, said thut this\nyear’s Georgia cotton crop is the smallest\never known. C. H. Casson of winning\nham reported that farmers in Alabama\nare rapidly diversifying their crops. H.\nS. Mobley of Arkansas said that torren\ntial ruins had done serious damage to\ncotton in his State. Among the sub\njects which will be discussed are: Meth\nods of amalgamating warehouses, estab\nlishment of cotton grading schools, the\nregulation of produce exchanges, what\nspecial legislation farmers need, packing\nhouses, fertilizing and other topics of\nparticular interest not only to cotton\nfarmers, but to all agriculturists.\nSIGEL GIRLS LETTERS READ\nTold Both Ling and Gain That She\nLoved Them.\nNew York.—The first actual evidence\nof the strange, triangular romance which\nresulted in the tragic death of Elsie Sigel\nbecause of her friendship for two young\nChinamen was given ou^ at police head\nquarters.

This letter also re\nveals the coquetry brought into play by\nthe pretty high school graduate to hold\ntilt affections of both of her Chinese\nsweethearts. From the reading of the\nletters the willingness of an American\nmother for her daughter to make an alli\nance with a Chinaman is shown witii such\nclearness as to leave no doubt about the\nsocial basis upon which Orientals were\nreceived and entertained in this strange\nhousehold.\nMOON WAS CAPTURED.\nAstronomer See Refutes Old Theory of\nEarth’s Origin.\nBerkeley, Cal.—That he hail mathe\nmatically proved a discovery that the\nmoon was a planet captured by the\nearth from space, and not a detached\nportion of our globe, was the announce\nment made by Prof. T.

Continuous rains\nstopped cultivation and the grass made\nsuch headway that a greater percentage\nof the fields must be abandoned. Some\ncrops have received no cultivation at all.\nThe best of weather in the future can\nnot repair the loss already sustained.\nThe plant in these States, even where\npartially cultivated, is small and grow\ning slowly. It is far behind last season.\nElsewhere the crop lias improved. The\nimprovement in North Carolina, South\nCarolina, Tennessee and Arkansas was\nnot great, being rather less than normal,\nbecause rains delayed work and pre\nvented the farmers putting fields in a\ngood state of cultivation. It is still\npossible, however, in these districts, to\nregain much of the loss.\nin Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana\ncotton made normal progress, and is\nnow in the best condition of the season.\nTennessee—The cotton crop in Tennes\nsee is grassy and not well cultivated.\nSome improvement resulted during the\nweek, as rains were not so heavy as\nelsewhere east of the river.\nMississippi—Many rains fell during\nthe week and little cultivation was done.\nThe plant is small and badly in grass.\nThe abandonment of acreage because of\nthe impossibility of cultivation will be\nluiiNiifi aim*. 1 ue utsi wpjuiut ucnce\nforth will not repair all the loss.\nAlubania—Little progress was made\nin cultivation, as rainfall was general\nand in many sections daily. The crop\nis very grassy and some lands in the\nbottoms will be abandoned. The plant\nis very small and the outlook is regarded\neverywhere as gloomy. Good weathei\ncan not repair the Joss that has beer\nsuffered.\nLouisiana—With a few local excep\ntions the rainfall of the week was bene\nfieial. The crop improved greatly in\ncondition and growth. It is regarded\nnow as promising in the south and west.\nBoll weevils, however, are numerous.\nArkansas—Cultivation is behind a nor\nmal, and some of the crops are very\ngrassy. Rainfall during the week not\ngeneral, and in the drier districts eon\nsiderable progress was made in cultiva\ntion. Sonic reports are good. The boll\nweevil is becoming increasingly numer\nous.\nTexas—Rains were local and, except\non the coast, where they were excessive,\nbenefitted cotton. A few sections had\nno rain, but have not suffered. Temper\natures were high and cheeked the boll\nweevil, which are growing more numer\nous.

But they are\n("useful articles of diet, nevertheless,\nbecause of their anti scorbutic value.\nFruit also promotes intestinal action,\ni but care must be taken that it is\nneither too ripe nor unripe. If any\nthing. the over-ripe fruit is the most\ndangerous, because it is liable to bac\nteria, and deteriorates rapidly. Dates\nare highly nutritious; the melon con\ntains the most water, the grape Is\nrich in the best kind of sugar, and\nthe currant and raspberry contain a\ngreat amount of free acid. Peaches\nare the most fattening of fruits, be\ncause of their cellulose. Fruits are\nexcellent correctives of the liquor\nhabit, and one who eats much fruit\nIs seldom a drinker.\nMany kinds of fruit are better put\nup at 186 degrees than at the boiling\npoint.
