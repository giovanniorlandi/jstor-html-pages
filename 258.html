        <pre>['126\nBOOKS\nAccording to the narrative of the cold war \nthat has become conventional wisdom, the \nend went like this: We (the United States \nand its allies) won; they (the Soviet Union and its \nEastern European minions) lost. But history, of \ncourse, is messier than that.\nWe all know that 1989 marked the end of the \ncold war and the beginning of the end of the Soviet \nUnion. What is less certain is precisely why the \ncold war ended then. In the United States, a triumphalist,\nzero-sum interpre-\ntation has taken hold among \nthose who embrace the victors’ \nprivilege to write, and simplify, \nthe history.\nBut what if someone wrote a \nhistory that told the story from all sides, one that \ndrew not only on memoirs and press accounts \nand the earlier work of scholars but also on the \narchives of nearly all the principal parties to the \nconflict, a history that included interviews with \nthe diplomats, politicians, and activists who took \npart in the events? And what if someone wrote \nthis history analytically, parsing out the major \ndecisions and events, remaining sensitive to the \ngrays that shade human behavior, and avoiding \ndefinitive, black-and-white judgments designed to \nscore political points?\nMary Elise Sarotte of the University of Southern \nCalifornia has written such a history. It is called \n1989: The Struggle To Create Post–Cold War Europe. \nA masterful work, fluently written, it weaves into \nits narrative diverse perspectives that help tell \nthe story of the demise of Soviet rule in Eastern \nEurope and the unification of Germany after \nnearly half a century of division.\nvision-fRee\nActually, 1989 tells two stories. One of them \nfocuses on East Germany, the end of Soviet rule \nthere, and the lack of widespread violence surrounding\nthat transition (in contrast to Romania \nand Yugoslavia in the years to come). The other \nstory, which Sarotte believes is more important \nto understand, describes how the end of the cold \nwar marked a new beginning, a new order—yet \nan order that was, and remains, without new \ninstitutions or a new political-military architecture,\nin part because, as President George H. W. \nBush said, he didn’t do “the vision thing.” Nor \nhas anyone since.\nThe first of Sarotte’s narratives features \nWashington, Bonn, and Paris \nstriving together—via the \npersonalities of Bush, German \nChancellor Helmut Kohl, and \nFrench President François \nMitterrand—to grasp the new \nreality and openings created by Soviet President \nMikhail Gorbachev’s reforms and by his desire to \nreinvigorate a sclerotic Soviet Union. Sarotte vividly\ncaptures the events that rapidly followed the \nfall of the Berlin Wall and how Kohl especially \nwas able to use them to his, and Germany’s, \nadvantage.\nThe second story delineates a new international \npolitics that has continued to this day, but one \nstill based on cold war institutions and, to a great \ndegree, cold war thinking. Arguing against Francis \nFukuyama’s view that a new post-history beyond \nthe old geopolitics began with the end of the cold \nwar, Sarotte sees lost opportunities with regard \nto Russia and the continuation of a post–World \nWar II mentality, according to which NATO was \nseen as essential even as the Soviet Union and the \nWarsaw Pact became history.\nTwenty years after Germany’s reunification, \nthe postwar structure of NATO and the European \nUnion still secures Europe’s political and economic\nfoundations. Whether this is necessarily a \nnegative outcome is unclear, and Sarotte does not \nargue that it is. But it does entail loss, in the sense \nof squandered chances to develop a new strategic \narchitecture. Sarotte’s book in this respect conveys \na much-needed appreciation that history, even at \nits hinges, is anything but simple. ■\nThe Making of a (Partly) New Order\nwilliAM w. FinAn Jr.\nwilliAM w.
