The object ot the opera\ntions is not clearly understood here,\nbut it.is suggested that the Russians\neither intended to turn the Japanese\nleft and move a heavy torce down west\nof the Liao river or were seeking to\ndivert attention from some projected\noperation against the Japanese right.\nIt is reported that the weather is\nwarmer since Jan. 25, but it is still\nextremely cold, so that it is impossible\nto expose the troops at night.\nThe Tokio press expresses the opin\nion that General Kuropatkin either or\ndered the movement to divert atten\ntion from the domestic conditions in\nRussia or that he had planned to make\na fight before Field Marshal Oyama\nhad been heavily reinforced.\nManchnrian army headquarters, tel\negraphing Jan. 29, says:\n"Tnere has been no great change in\nthe direction of the right and center\narmies since the night of Jan. 28, ex\ncept constant collisions between re\nconnoitering parties.

The stranger then\ndisappeared.\nCounsel for Russia protested that\nthis testimony was not directly con\nnected with the North sea incident,\nbut Admiral Fournier, president of the\ncommission, ruled that the testimony\nwas admissible. Hugh O\'Beirne, the\nBritish agent, said that the strange\nvessel was the Russian transport\nKamtchatka, which mistook the Swed\nish craft for a torpedo boat. Mr.\nO\'Beirne further declared- that the\nKamtchatka thereafter sent a wireless\nmessage to Vice Admiral Rojestvensky\nnotifying him that she had been at\ntacked by a torpedo boat and Rojest\nvensky thereupon ordered his squad\nron to be on the lookout for torpedo\nboats, which.

Beyond the\nfact of the attack at Warsaw result\ning in the wounding of the Britiph vice\nconsul, who is now in a hospital, the\nBritish embassy here has no details\nof the affair, but Sir Charles Hardinge,\nthe British ambassador, has already\ndelivered a note to Foreign Minister\nLamsdorff asking for an immediate in\nvestigation and explanation,, reserving\nany claims which may be hereafter\nmade and at the same time asking for\nthe protection of British consuls\nthroughout the empire. By the first\ntrain he also dispatched Major Napier,\nthe British military attache, to War\nsaw to secure a full report on the cir\ncumstances.\nPlacards Ordered Removed.\nCount Lamsdorff replied to Ambas\nsador Hardinge\'s second note on the\nsubject of the Moscow placards by\nsaying that instructions had been sent\nto remove all traces of the placards\nfrom the streets. It is now learned,\nhowever, that similar notices had been\nposted at Libau and Reval, which led\nto a renewal of representation on this\nscore. .In this connection the appear\nance of the proclamation of the holy\nsyTtou instructing the orthodox priests\nto inform their parishioners that the\nstrike and revolutionary movements\nwere promoted by the external as well\nas-internal enemies of Russia with the\nobject of embarrassing the military\nand naval plans has created some\nthing of a flurry among foreigners\nhere, especially the British, who be\nlieve that the object is to incite hos\ntility. No further action, however, has\nbeen taken by either Ambassador Har\ndinge or the other foreign representa\ntives.\nPrivate advices from Warsaw say\nthe authorities there have already\ntaken over charge of the waterworks,\nelectric light and gas plants and that\nserious trouble is anticipated.\nSERIOUS RIOTS AT WARSAW\nNUMBER OF KILLED OR WOUNDED\nESTIMATED A ON E HUN\nDRED AN SIXTY.\nWarsaw, Russian Poland, Jan. 31.\nThe number of killed or wounded dur\ning the rioting here Sunday is esti\nmated at 16".\nOut of door life in the city is at a\ncomplete standstill.

All\nplaces of business are closed.\nA proclamation has been issued de\nclaring that the condition of the city\nrequires additional protective meas\nures. The strikers, it is added, must\nreturn to work unconditionally.\nRUSSIA REPLIES TO CHINA.\nReasserts Latter Country Has Vio\nlated Neutrality.\nBerliny Jan. 31.The Russian gov\nernment\'s reply to China\'s declarations\nthat she has not infringed neutrality\nnor permitted Japan to do so is a reas\nserfion that she has done so. The Rus\nsian note, which was communicated to\nthe powers Saturday, gives specifica\ntions of what is affirmed to be viola\ntions of neutrality, but the tone of the\nreply is such that it is inferred that\nRussia is not likely to carry the discus\nsion much further. It is learned here\nthat Russia found that all the powers,\n"particularly Germany, held views iden\ntical with those of the United States\non limiting the zone of war and keep\ning China out of it.\nCHARGED BY TROOPS.\nON\nat\nBritish Consul and Vice Consul\nWarsaw Attacked.\nLondon, Jan. 31.The foreign office\nhas received a telegram from Consul\nGeneral Murray at Warsaw reporting\nthat himself and Vice Consul Mucu\nkain were charged by Jtussian cavalry\nmen engaged in clearing the streets\nof Warsaw.

There is a widespread con\nviction that the divorce laws are dan\ngerously lax and indifferently adminis\ntered in some of the states, resulting in\na diminishing regard for the sanctity\nof the marriage relation.\n"The hope is Phtertained that co-",\noperation amongst the several states\ncan be secured to the end that there\nmay be enacted, upon the subject of\nmarriage an* divorce, uniform laws,\ncontaining all possible safeguards for\nthe security of the family. Intelligent\nand prudent action in that direction\nwill be greatly promoted by securing\nreliable and trustworthy statistics\nupon marriage and divorce. I deem\nthe matter of sufficient general impor\ntance to recommend that the director\nof the census be authorized by appro\npriate legislation to collect and pub\nlish statistics pertaining to that sub\nject covering the period from 1886 to\nthe present time."\'\nRAILRUAD\n\\M\nL\nRATE MAKING\nWashington, Jan. 31.The Repub\nlican members of the house commit\ntee on interstate and foreign com\nmerce at a meeting during the day de\ncided to report the Townsend and\nEsch bills on the subject of railroad\nrate making.

Beyond the\nfact of the attack at Warsaw result\ning in the wounding of the British vice\nconsul, who is now in a hospital, the\nBritish embassy here has no details\nof the affair, but Sir Charles Hardinge,\nthe British ambassador, has already\ndelivered a note to Foreign Minister\nLamsdorff asking for an immediate in\nvestigation and explanation,, reserving\nany claims which may be hereafter\nmade and at the same time asking for\nthe protection of British consuls\nthroughout the empire.

In this connection the appear\nance of the proclamation of the holy\nsyflod instructing the orthodox priests\nto inform their parishioners that the\nstrike and revolutionary movements\nwere promoted by the external as well\nas- internal enemies of Russia with the\nobject of embarrassing the military\nand naval plans has created some\nthing of a flurry among foreigners\nhere, especially the British, who be\nlieve that, the object is to incite hos\ntility. No further action, however, has\nbeen taken by either Ambassador Har\ndinge or the other foreign representa\ntives.\nPrivate advices from Warsaw say\nthe authorities there have already\ntaken over charge of the waterworks,\nelectric light and gas plants and that\nserious trouble is anticipated.\nSERIOUS RIOTS AT WARSAW\nNUMBER OF KILLED OR WOUNDED\nESTIMATED AT ONE HUN-\nDRED AND SIXTY.\nWarsaw, Russian Poland, Jan. 31.\nThe number of killed or wounded dur\ning the rioting here Sunday is esti\nmated at 160.\nOut of door life in the city is at a\ncomplete standstill.

The Rus\nsian note, which was communicated to\nthe powers Saturday, gives specifica\ntions of what is affirmed to be viola\ntions of neutrality, but the tone of the\nreply is such that it is inferred that\nRussia is not likely to carry the discus\nsion much further. It is learned here\nthat Russia found that all the powers,\n"particularly Germany, held views iden\ntical with those of the United States\non limiting the zone of war and keep\ning China out of it.\nCHARGED BY TROOPS.\nat\nto makti urgent representations at St.\nPetersburg on the subject.\nDEFECTIVE PAGE\nPresident Asks Congress to Provido\nfor Gathering Statistics.\nWashington, Jan. 31.The president\nsent a message to congress during the\nday calling attention to the fact that\nno statistics on marriage and divorce\nhave been collected since 1S86 and\nrecommended legislation. The follow\ning is the text of the message:\n"I call the attention of the congress\nto the tact that no statistics have been\ncollected by the federal government\nupon the subject of marriage and di\nvorce since the year 1886 and that but\nfew of the states have provision for\nthe collection of such statistics.\n"The institution of marriage is of\ncourse at the very foundation of our\nsocial organization and all influences\nthat affect that institution are of vital\nconcern to the people of the whole\ncountry. There is a widespread con\nviction that the divorce laws are dan\ngerously lax and indifferently adminis\ntered in some of the states, resulting in\na diminishing regard for the sanctity\nof the marriage relation.\n"The hope is ffitertained that co\noperation amongst the several states\ncan be secured to the end that there\nmay be enacted, upon the subject of\nmarriage an* divorce, uniform laws,\ncontaining all possible safeguards for\nthe security of the family. Intelligent\nand prudent action in that direction\nwill be greatly promoted by securing\nreliable and trustworthy statistics\nupon marriage and divorce. I deem\nthe matter of sufficient general impor\ntance to recommend that the director\nof the census be authorized by appro\npriate legislation to collect and pub\nlish statistics pertaining to that sub\nject covering the period from 1886 to\nthe present time."\nON RAILROAD RATE MAKING\nBritish Consul and Vice Consul\nWarsaw Attacked.\nLondon, Jan. 31.The foreign office\nhas received a telegram from Consul\nGeneral Murray at Warsaw reporting\nthat himself and Vice Consul Mucu\nkain were charged by Russian cavalry\nmen engaged in clearing the streets\nof Warsaw.

Kieley first came into\nnational prominence through his nomi\nnation by President Cleveland in 1885\nas minister to Italy. His appointment\nwas cancelled on account of the objec\ntions of the Italian government. He\nwas then accredited by President\nCleveland as minister to Vienna, but\nthe Austrian government also declared\nMr. Keiley to be persona non grata,\nthe first objection being that he held\nultramontane views that were offen\nsive to a friendly government. This\nground was not satisfactory to an in\nfluential circle in Austria and it was\nthen alleged that his Catholicism was\nlax from which charge he was warmly\ndefended by the administration. Sec\nretary Bayard addressed a note to the\nAustrian government in which he com\nmented on the unreasonableness of\nrace and religious distinctions. The\nsecretary even went so far as to say\nthat the appointment would be al\nlowed to stand even though it resulted\nin a cessation of diplomatic relations\nbetween the United States and Aus\ntria. To relieve the administration of\nPresident Cleveland of further embar\nrassment Mr. Keiley resigned and\nlater was appointed to the interna\ntional court at Cairo. He resigned in\nApril, 1902, owing, it was understood,\nto the death of his wife.- His record\nin Cairo was distinguished by ability.\nPRINCE GURIELLY KILLED.\nRussian Officer Shot by an Unknown\nMan at Batoum.\nBatoum, Jan. 31.Prince Gurielly,\nan officer of the police guard, while\ndriving past the iron works Sunday\nmorning was\'shot and killed by an un\nknown man.
