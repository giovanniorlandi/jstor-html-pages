        <pre>['C n A V T E a  V I  \nProcedures and Effects of Mass Communication \nW I L B U R  S C H R A M M  \nThe Process \nIt will be easier to see how mass communication works if we \nfirst look at the communication process in general. \nCommunication comes from the Latin communis, common. \nWhen  we communicate, we are t rying to establish a "commonness" \nwith someone. Tha t  is, we are t rying to share information, an \nidea, or an attitude. At  this moment I am trying to communicate \nto you the idea that the essence of communication is getting the \nreceiver and the sender " tuned" together for a particular message. \nAt  this moment, someone somewhere is excitedly telephoning the \nfire department that the house is on fire. Somewhere else a young \nman in a parked automobile is t rying to convey the understanding \nthat he is moon-eyed because he loves the young lady beside him. \nSomewhere else a newspaper is t rying to persuade its readers to \nbelieve as it does about the Republican Party. All these are forms \nof communication, and the process in each case is essentially the \ns a m e .  \nTHE ELEMENTS OF CO MMU N I CA TI O N  AND THEIR FUNCTIONS \nCommunication always requires at least three elements--the \nsender, the message, and the receiver. A sender may be an indi- \nvidual (speaking, writing, drawing, gesturing) or a communication \norganization (like a newspaper, publishing house, television station, \no r  motion-picture studio). T h e  message may be in the form of \nink on paper, Sound waves in the air, impulses in an clectric current, \na wave of the hand, a flag in the air, or any other.signal capable of \nbehag interpreted meaningfully. The receiver may be an individual \nl;~e.rting, watching, or reading; or a member of a group, such as \n', '114 E F F E C T S  O F  M A S S  C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \na discussion group, a lecture audience, a football crowd, or a mob; \nor a member of the mass audience, such as the reader of a news- \npaper or a viewer of television. \nNow what happens when the sender tries to build up this \n"commonness" with his intended receiver? First, the sender encodes \nhis message. That is, he takes the information or feeling he wants \nto share and puts it into a form that can be transmitted.  The \n"pictures in our heads" can\'t be transmitted until they are coded. \nWhen they are coded into spoken words, they can be transmitted \neasily and effectively, but they can\'t travel very far unless radio \ncarries them. If they are coded into written words, they go more \nslowly than spoken words, but they go farther and last longer. \nIndeed, some messages long outlive their senders--the Iliad, for \ninstance; the "Gettysburg Address"; Chartres cathedral. \nOnce coded and sent, a message is quite free of its sender, and \nwhat it does is beyond the power of the sender to change. Every \nwriter feels a sense of helplessness when he finally commits his story \nor his poem to print; you doubtless feel the same way when you \nmail an important letter. Will it reach the right person? Will he \nunderstand it as you intend him to? Will he respond as you want \nhim to? For, in order to complete the act of communication, the \nmessage must be decoded. And there is good reason, as we shall \nsee, for the sender to wonder whether his receiver will really be \nin tune with him, whether the message will be interpreted without \ndistortion, whether the "picture in the head" of the receiver will \nbear any resemblance to that in the head of the sender. \nWe are talking about something very like a radio or telephone \ncircuit. In fact, it is perfectly possible to draw a picture of the \nhuman communication system that way: \nSubstitute "microphone" for encoder, and "earphone" for "de- \ncoder," and you are talking about electronic commtinication. Con- \nsider that the "sender" and "encoder" are one person, "decoder" and \n"receiver" are another, and the signal is language, and you are \n', 'S C H R A M M  I I  5 \ntalking about human communication. \nIt is possible by looking at those diagrams to predict how such \na system will work, For one thing, the system can be no stronger \nthan its weakest link. In engineering terms, there may be filtering \nor distortion at any stage. In human terms, if the sender does not \nhave adequate or clear information; if the message is not encoded \nfully, accurately, and effectively in transmittable signs; if these \nare not transmitted fast enough and accurately enough, despite \ninterference and competition, to the desired receiver; if the mes- \nsage is not decoded in a pattern that corresponds to the encoding; \nand, finally, if the receiver is unable to handle the decoded message \nso as to produce the desired response--then, obviously, the system \nis working at less than top efficiency. When we realize that all \nthese steps must be accomplished with relatively high efficiency if \nany communication is to be successful, the everyday act of explain- \ning something to a stranger or writing a letter seems a minor miracle. \nA system like this will have a maximum capacity for handling \ninformation, which depends on the separate capacities of each unit \nin the chain--for example, the capacity of the channel (how fast \ncan one talk?) or the capacity of the encoder (can your student \nunderstand something explained quickly?). If the coding is good \n(for example, no unnecessary words), the capacity of the channel \ncan be approached, but it can \'never be exceeded. You can readily \nsee that one of the great skills of communication will lie in know- \ning how near capacity to operate a channel. \nThis is partly determined for us by the nature of the language. \nEnglish, like every other language, has its sequences of words and \nsounds governed by certain probabilities. If it were organized so. \nthat no set of probabilities governed the likelihood that certain \nwords would follow certain other words (for example, that a noun \nwould follow an adjective, or that "States" or "Nations" would \nfollow "United"), then we would have nonsense. As a matter of \nfact, we can calculate the relative amount of freedom open to us \nin writing any language. For English, the freedom is about 5 ° per \ncent. (Incidentally, this is about the required amount of freedom \nto enable us to construct interesting crossword puzzles. Shannon \nhas estimated that if we had about 7 ° per cent of freedom, we \ncould construct three-dimensional crossword puzzles. If w e  had \n', '116 E F F E C T S  OF M A S S  C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \nonly  zo per cent, crossword puzzle-making would not  be wor th  \nwhile).  \nSo much for  language redundancy, as communication theorists \ncall it, meaning the percentage of the message which is not  open \nto free choice. But there is also the communicator \'s  redundancy.  \nThis is an important  aspect of constructing a message for, if we \nthink our  audience may have a hard time understanding the mes- \nsage, we can deliberately i n t r o d u c e  more redundancy;  we can \nrepeat (just as the radio operator  on a ship may send "SOS" over \nand over  again to make sure it is heard and decoded) ,  or  we can \ngive examples and analogies. In other  words, we may choose be- \ntween transmitting more information in a given time, or trans- \nmitting less and repeating more in the hope of  being better  under-  \nstood. It  is often a delicate choice, because too slow a rate will \nbore an audience, whereas too fast a rate may confuse them. \nTHE ROLE OF EXPERIENCE IN COMMUNICATION \nPerhaps the most important  thing about such a system is one \nwe have been talking about all too gl ib ly-- the  fact that receiver \nand sender must be in tune. This is clear enough in the case oJf a \nradio transmitter and receiver, but  somewhat more complicated \nwhen it means that a human receiver must be able to understand a \nhuman sender. \nLet  us redraw our  diagram in a ve ry  simple form, like this: \nField of e x p e r i e n ~  \nThink  of  those circles as the accumulated experience of the two \nindividuals t ry ing to communicate.  Th e  sender can encode or  the \nthe receiver can decode only in terms of the experience he has had. \nI f  we have never learned any Russian, we can neither code nor  \ndecode in that language. If  an African tribesman has never seen \nor  heard of an airplane, he can only decode the sight of  a plane \n', 'S C H R A M M  tx 7 \nin terms of whatever experience he has had. The plane may seem \nto him to be a bird, and the aviator a god l~orne on wings. If the \ncircles in our diagram have a large area in common, then com- \nmunication is easy. I f  the circles do not meet--if there has been \nno common experience--then communication is impossible. If the \ncircles have only a small area in common--that is, if the experiences \nof sender and receiver have been strikingly unlike--then it is going \nto be very difficult to get an intended meaning across from one to \nthe other. This is the difficulty we face when a person who is not \ntrained in science tries to read Einstein or when we try to commu- \nnicate with another culture much different from our own. \nThe sender, then, tries to encode in such a way as to make it \neasy for the receiver to tune in the message--to relate it to parts of \nhis experience which are much like those of the sender. What  does \nhe have to work with? \nMessages are made up of signs. A sign is a signal that stands for \nsomething in experience. The word "dog" is a sign that stands for \nour generalized experience with dogs. The word would be mean- \ningless to a person who came from a dogless island and had never \nread of or heard of a dog. But most of us have learned that word \nby association, just as we learn most signs. Someone called our \nattention to an animal, and said "dog." When we learned the word, \nit produced in us much the same response as the object it stood for. \nThat is, when we heard "dog" we could recall the appearance of \ndogs, their sound, their feel, perhaps their smell. But there is an im- \nportant difference between the sign and the object: The sign always \nrepresents the object at a reduced level Of cues. By this we mean \nsimply that the sign will no t  call forth all the responses that the \nobject itself will call forth. The sign "dog," for example, will \nprobably not call forth in us the same wariness or attention a strange \ndog might attract if it wandered into our presence. \nThis is the price we pay for portability in language. We have \na sign system that we can use in place of the less portable originals \n(for example, Margaret Mitchell could recreate the burning of \nAtlanta in a novel, and a photograph could transport world-wide \nthe appearance of a bursting atomic bomb), but our sign system \nis merely a kind of shorthand. The coder has to be able to write \nthe shorthand, the decoder to read it. And no two persons have \n', 'I f 8  E F F E C T S  O F  M A S S  C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \nlearned exactly the samc system. For example, a person who has \nknown only Arctic Huskies will not have learned exactly the same \nmeaning for the shorthand sign "dog" as will a person who comes \nfrom a city where he has known only Pekinese and Pomeranians. \nWe have come now to a point where we need to tinker a little \nmore with our diagram of the communication process. It is obvious \nthat each person in the communication process is both an encoder \nand a decoder. He receives and transmits. He must be able to write \nreadable shorthand and to read other peoples\' shorthand. There- \nfore, it is possible to describe either sender or receiver in a human \ncommunication system thus: \n( 8 \nU \nV \n1 \nWhat happens when a signal comes to you? Remember that \nit comes in the form of a sign. If you have learned the sign, you \nhave learned certain responses with it. We can call these mediatory \nresponses, because they mediate what happens to the message in \nyour nervous system. These responses are the meaning the sign has \nfor you. They are learned from experience, as we said, but they \nare affected by the state of your organism at the moment. For \nexample, if you are hungry, a picture of a steak may not arouse \nexactly the same response in you as when ~ you are overfed. \nBut subject to these effects, the mediatory responses will then \ndetermine what you do about the sign, for you have learned other. \nsets of reactions connected to the mediatory responses. A sign \nthat means a certain thing to you will start certain other processes \nin your nerves and muscles. A sign that means "fire," for example, \nwill certainly trigger off some activity in you. A sign that means \nyou are in danger may start the process in your nerves and muscles \nthat makes you say, "Help!" In other words, the meaning that \n', 'S C H R A M M  i t  9 \' \nresults from b\'our decoding of a sign will  start you encoding. \nExactly ,what you encode .will depend on your choice of the re- \nsponses available in the situation and connected with the meaning. \nWhether this encoding actually results in some overt communi- \ncation or action depends partly on the barriers in the way. You \nmay think it better to keep silent. If an action does occur, the \nnature of the action will depend on the avenues for action available \nto you and the barriers in your way. The code of your group may \nnot sanction the action you want to take. The meaning of a sign \nmay make you want to hit the person who has said it, but he may \nbe too big, or you may be in the wrong social situation. You may \nmerely ignore him, or "look-murder at him," or say something \nnasty about him to someone else. \nWhatever the result of your decoding of a given sign, the \nprocess in which you are engaged is one of continuing activity. \nYou are constantly decoding signs from your efivironment, inter- \npreting these signs, and encoding something as a result. In fact, it \nis misleading to think of the communication process as starting \nsomewhere and ending somewhere. It is really endless. W e  are \nlittle switchboard centers handling and rerouting the great endless \ncurrent of communication. W e  can accurately think of communi- \ncation as passing through us--changed, to be sure, by our inter- \npretations, our habits, our abilities and capabilities, b u t  the input \nstill being reflected in the output. \nW e  need now to add one  more elerhent to our description o f  \nthe communication process. Ctnsider what happens in a conversa- \ntion between two people. Each is constantly communicating back \nto the other, thus: \n', '1 2 0  E F F E C T S  O F  M A S S  C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \nThe return process is called feedback and plays an important \npart in communication because it tells us how our messages are \nbeing interpreted. Does the hearer say, "Yes, yes, that\'s right," as \nwe t ry  to persuade him? Does he nod his head in agreement? Does \na puzzled f rown appear on his forehead? Does he look away as \nthough he were losing interest? All these are feedback. So is a \nletter to the editor of a newspaper, protesting an editorial. So is \nan answer to a letter. So is the applause of a lecturer\'s audience. An \nexperienced communicator is attentive to feedback and constantly \nmodifies his messages in light of what  he observes in or hears from \nhis audience. \nThis is how communication works, whether it is mass corn= \nmunication, communication in a group, or communication between \ntwo individuals. \nDetermining the Effects of Communication \nThe chief reason we study this process is to learn something \nabout how it achieves the desired effects. W e  want  to know what  \na given kind of communication does to people. Given a certain \nmessage content, we should like to be able to predict what  effect \nthat content will have on its receivers. \\ \nEvery time we insert an advertisement in a newspaper, put up \na sign, explain something to a class, scold a child, write a letter, or \nput our political candidate on radio or television, we are making a \nprediction about the effect this communication will have. I am \npredict ing now that what  I am writing will help you understand \nthe common, everyday miracle of communication. Perhaps I am \nwrong. Certainly many political parties have been proved wrong in \ntheir predictions about the effects of their candidates\' radio speeches. \nSome advertisements sell goods; others don\'t. Some class teaching \n"goes over"; some does not. It is apparent to you, from what you \nhave read so far, that there is no such thing as a simple and easily \npredictable relationship between message content and effect. \nPROVIDING P R O P E R  CONDITIONS FOR C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \nNevertheless, it is possible to describe what might be Called the \nconditions of success in communicat ion--by which we mean the \nconditions that must be fulfilled if the message is to arouse its in- \n', 'S C H R A M r v l  121 \ntended response. Let  us set them down here briefly, and then talk \nabout  them: \ni )  The  message must  be so designed and delivered as to gain the atten- \ntion of the intended receiver. \nz) The  message must  employ signs .which refer to experience common \nto both sender and receiver, so as to "get the meaning across." \n3) The  message must arouse personality needs in the receiver and sug- \ngest some ways to m e e t  those needs. \n4) The  message must  suggest a way to meet  those needs w h i c h  is appro- \npriate to the group situatio~ in which the receiver finds himself at the \ntime when he is nzoved to make the desired response. \nYou can see, by  looking at these requirements, w h y  the expert \ncommunica tor  usually begins b y  finding out as much  as he can about \nhis intended receiver and w h y  "know your  audience" is the first \nrule of  practical mass communication.  For  it is important  to know \nthe r ight  t iming f o r  a message, the kind of language one must use \nto be understood, the attitudes and values one must appeal to in \norder  to be effective, and the group standards in which the desired \naction will have to take place. This  is relatively easy in face-to-face \ncommunication,  more difficult in mass communication.  In either \ncase, it is necessary. \nLet  us talk about  these four  requirements. \ni )  T h e  message mus t  be so designed and del ivered as to gain \nthe  a t tent ion  o f  the  in tended  rece iver .  This is not so easy as it \nsounds. For  one thing, the message must be made available. There  \nwill\' be no communicat ion if we d o n \' t  talk loudly enough to be \nheard, or  if our  letter is not delivered, or if we smile at the r ight  \nperson when she isn\'t looking. And even if the message is available, \nit m a y  not be selected. Each of us has available far more communi-  \ncation than we can possibly accept or  decode. We,  therefore, scan \nour  environment  in much  the same way  as we scan newspaper head- \nlines or  read a table of  contents. W e  choose messages according to \nour  impression of their general characteris t ics--whett ier  they fit our  \nneeds and interests. W e  choose usually on the basis of  an impression \nwe get f rom one cue in the message, which may  be a headline, a \nname in a radio news story, a picture, a patch of color, or  a sound. \nI f  that cue does not appeal to us, we may  never open our senses to \nthe message. \n', ',~z ~ F ~ c x s  o~ MASS COMMUN,C^T~ON \nIn different situations, of course, we choose differently among \nthese cues. For example, if you arc speaking to me at a time when \nI am relaxed and idle, or when I am waiting for the kind of message \nyou  have (for instance, that my  friends have come to take me \nfishing), then you are more likely to get good attention than if you  \naddress me when noise blots out what  you  say, o r  when all my  \nattention is given to some competing message, or when I am too \nsleepy to pay attention, or when I am thinking about something else \nand have simply "tuned out." ( H o w  many times have you finished \nspeaking and realized that your  intended receiver had simply not \nheard a word you said?) The  designing of a message for attention, \nthen, involves timing, placing, and equipping it with cues which will \nappeal to the receiver\'s interests. \nz) Tloe message must employ signs vJoicb refer to experience \ncommon to both sender and receiver, in order to "get the meaning \nacross." W e  have already talked about this problem of getting the \nreceiver in tune with the sender. Let us add now that as our experi- \nence with environment grows, we tend to classify and catalog ex- \nperience in terms of how it relates to other experience and to our \nneeds and interests. As  we grow older that catalog system grows \nharder and firmer. It tends to reject messages that do not fit its \nstructure, or to distort them so that they  do fit. It  will reject Einstein, \nperhaps, because it feels it can\'t understand him. If  an airplane is a \ncompletely new experience, but a bird is not, it may, as we  have \nsaid, interpret the plane as a large, noisy bird. If  it is Republican, \nit will tend  to reject Democratic radio speeches or to recall only the \nparts that can be made into pro-Republican arguments; this is one \nof the things we  have found out about voting behavior. Therefore, \nin designing a message; we have to be sure not only that we speak \nthe "same language" as the receiver, and that we don\'t  "write over \nhis head," but also that we don\'t  conflict too directly with the way \nhe sees and catalogs the world. There are some circumstances, true, \nin which it works well to conflict directly, but for the most part \nthese are the circumstances in which our understandings and atti- \ntudes are not yet  firm or fixed, and they  are relatively few and  far \nbetween. In communicating, as in flying an airplane, the rule is \nthat when a stiff wind is blowing, one doesn\'t land cross-wind unless \nhe has to. \n', '8 C H R A M M  12 3 \n3) The message must arouse personality needs in tbe receiver \nand suggest some ~ways to meet those needs. We take action because \nof need and toward goals. In certain simple situations, the action \nresponse is quite automatic. When our nerves signal "pain-heat- \nfinger" we jerk our fingers back from the hot pan. When our optic \nnerve signals "red traffic light," we stop the car. In more com- \nplicated situations we usually have more freedom of choice, and we \nchoose the action which, in the given situation, will come closest to \nmeeting our needs or goals. The first requisite of an effective mes- \nsage, therefore (as every advertising man knows), is that it relate \nitself to one of our personality needs--the needs for security, status, \nbelongingness, understanding, freedom from constraint, love, free- \ndom from anxiety, and so forth. It must arouse a drive. It must \nmake the individual feel a need or a tension which he can satisfy \nby action. Then  the message can try to control the resulting action \nby suggesting what action to take. Thus an advertisement usually \ntells you to buy, what, and where. \nPropaganda to enemy troops usually suggests a specific action, \nsuch as surrender, subversion, or malingering. The suggested \naction, of course, is not always the one taken. If an easier, cheaper, \nor otherwise more acceptable action leading to the same goal is \nseen, that will probably be selected instead. For instance, it may be \nthat the receiver is not the kind of person to take vigorous action, \neven though that seems called for. The person\'s values may inhibit \nhim from doing What is suggested. Or his group role and member- \nship may control what action he takes, and it is this control we must \ntalk about now. \n4) The message must suggest a ~way to meet those needs wbicb \nis appropriate to doe group situation in v:loicb the receiver finds him- \nself at tloe time ~wben be is moved to ¢nake the desired response. We \nlive in groups. We get our first education in the primary group of \nour family. We learn most of our standards and values from groups. \nWe learn roles in groups, because those roles give us the most \norderly and satisfying routine of life. We make most of our com- \nmunication responses in groups. And if communication is going \nto bring about change in our behavior, the first place we look for \napproval of this new behavior is to the group. \n', 'I 2  4 E F F E C T S  O F  M A S S  C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \nW e  are scarcely aware of the great importance our  group in- \nvolvements have for  us, or of the loyalties we develop toward our  \nseveral groups and institutions, until our place in the group or the \ngroup itself is threatened. But ye t  if our  groups do not  sanction \nthe response we are inclined to make to  communication, then we \nare very  unlikely to make it. On the other hand, if our  group \nstrongly approves of a certain kind of action, that is the one we are \nlikely to select out of several otherwise even choices. \nYou can see how this works in practical situations. Th e  Jewish \nculture does not approve the eating of pork; the Indian culture \ndoes not  approve the slaughter of cows and the eating of beef. \nTherefore ,  it is highly unlikely that even the  most eloquent adver- \ntisement will persuade an or thodox Jewish family to go cont rary  to \ntheir group sanctions and buy  pork; or an or thodox Hindu family, \nto buy  beef. Or, take the very  simple communicat ionsi tuat ion of \na young  man and a young woman in a parked automobile. T h e  \nyoung  man communicates the idea that he wants a kiss. The re  isn\'t \nmuch likelihood of his not gaining attention for that communica- \ntion, but  how the young woman responds will depend on a number \nof  factors, part ly individual, part ly group. Does she want  to be \nkissed at that moment? Does she want  to be kissed by  that young  \nman? H o w  about the group customs under  which the girl lives? \nW h a t  has she learned from her parents and her friends about these \nthings? Of  course, she wouldn \' t  deliberately have a little debate \nwith herself such as we have suggested here, but  all these elements, \nand more, would enter into the decision she makes. \nPREDICTING T H E  E F F E C T S  OF C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \nThere  are two things we can say with confidence about pre- \ndicting communication effects. One is that a message is much more \nlikely to succeed if it fits the patterns of understandings, attitudes, \nvalues, and goals that a receiver has; or, at least, if it starts with \nthis pattern and tries to reshape it slightly. Communication-research \nmen call this latter process "canalizing," meaning that the sender \nprovides a channel to direct the already existing motives in the \nreceiver. Advertising men and propagandists say it more bluntly; \nthey  say that a communicator  must "start where the audience is." \nTeachers know they  should start "where the pupils are." You can \n', 'S C H  R A N I  NI 12 5 \nsee w h y  this is. O u r  peisonalities----our patterns Of habits, attitudes, \ndrives, values, and so f o r t h - - g r o w v e r y  slowly but firmly. \nI have elsewhere compared this channeling process to the slow, \nsure, ponderous growth of a stalagmite on a cave floor. The  stafag- \nmite builds up from the calcareous residue of the water dripping \non it from the cave roof. Each drop leaves only a t iny residue, \nand it is very seldom that we can detect the residue of any single \ndrop, or that any single drop will make a fundamental Change in \nthe shape or appearance of the stalagmite. Yet, together, all these \ndrops do build the stalagmite, and over the years it changes con- \nsiderably in size and somewhat in shape. This is the way our \nenvironment drips into us, drop by drop, each drop leaving a little \nresidue, each tending to follow the existing pattern. \nThis personality pattern we are talking about is, of course, an \nactive thing--not  passive, like the stalagmite--but still the similarity \nis there. When  we introduce one drop of communication into a \nperson where millions of drops have already fallen and left their \nresidue, we can hardly expect to reshape the personality funda- \nmentally by that one drop. If we are communicating to a child, \nit is easier, because the situation is not so firmly fixed. If  we are \ncommunicating in an area where ideas and values are not yet  deter- \nmined if our drop of communication falls where not many have \nfallen before--then we may be able to see a change as a result of \nour communication. But, in general, we musk admit that the best \nthing we can do is to build on what  already exists. \nIf  we take advantage of the existing pattern of understanding, \ndrives, and attitudes to gain acceptance for our message, then we \nmay hope to divert the pattern slightly in the direction we want  to \nmove it. Let\'s go back to elections again for an example. It is very \n" hard to change the minds of convinced Republicans or Democrats \nthrough communication, or even to get them to listen to the argu- \nments of the opposing party. On the other hand, it is possible to \nstart with a" Republican or Democratic viewpoint and slightly \nmodify  the existing party viewpoints in one way  or another. If  \nthis process goes on for long enough, it may even be possible to get \nconfirmed party-men to reverse their voting pattern. This is what \nthe Republicans were trying to do in the 1952 election by stressing \n"the mess in Washington," "time for a change," "the mistakes in \n', 'I 2 6  E F F E C T S  O F  M A S S  C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \nKorea;"\' and "the threat of communism," and apparently they we.re \nsuccessful in getting some ordinarily Democratic votes. But in \n1952, as in every campaign, the real objectives of the campaigning \nwere the new voters and the undecided voters. \nThe second thing we can say with confidence about communi- \ncation effects is that they are resultants of a number of forces, of \nwhich the communicator can really control only one. The sender, \nthat is, can shape his message and can decide when and where to \nintroduce it. But the message is only one of at least four important \nelements that determine what response occurs. The other three are \n(a) the situation in which the communication is received and in \nwhich the response, if any, must occur; (b) the personality state \nof the receiver; and (c) his group relationships and standards. This \nis why it is so dangerous to try to predict exactly what will be the \neffect of any message except the simplest one in the simplest \nsituation. \nLet us take an example. In Korea, in the first year of the war \nthere, I was interviewing a North Korean prisoner Of war who \nhad recently surrendered with one of our surrender leaflets on his \nperson. It looked like an open and shut case: the man had picked \nup the leaflet, thought it over, and decided to surrender. But I was \ninterviewing him anyway, trying to see just how the leaflet had its \neffect. This is what he told me. \nHe said that when he picked up the leaflet, it actually made him \nfight harder. It rather irritated him, and he didn\'t like the idea of \nhaving to surrender. He wasn\'t exactly a warlike man; he had \nbeen a clerk and was quiet and rather slow, but the message actually \naroused a lot of aggression in him. Then the situation deteriorated. \nHis division was hit hard and thrown back, and he lost contact with \nthe command post. He had no food, except what he could find in \nthe fields, and little ammunition. What  was left of his company was \nisolated by itself in a rocky valley. Even then, he said, the morale \nwas good, and there was no talk of surrendering. As a matter of \nfact, he said, the others would have shot him if he had tried to \nsurrender. But then a couple of our planes spotted them, shot up \ntheir hideout, and dropped some napalm. When it was over, he \nfound himself alone, a half mile from where he had been, with half \nhis jacket burned off, and no sign of any of his company. A couple \n', 'S C H R A M M  I2 7 \nof hours later some of our tanks came along. And only then did \nthe leaflet have an effect. He remembered it had to ld  him to sur- \nrender with his hands up, and he did so. \nIn other words, the communication had no effect (even had an \nOpposite effect from the one intended) so long as the situation, the \npersonality, and the group norms were not favorable. When  the \nsituation deteriorated, the group influence was removed and the per- " \nsonality aggression was burned up; then finally the message had \nan effect. I tell you this story hoping it will teach you what it \ntaught me. that it is dangerous to assume any simple and direct \nrelationship between a message and its effect without  knowing all \nthe other elements in the process. \nThe Nature of Mass Communication \nTHE ELEMENTS OF MASS COMMUNICATION \nNow let us look at mass communication in the light of what  we \nhave already said about communication in general. The  process is \nexactly what we have described, but the elements in the process are \nnot the same. \nThe  chief sender, in mass communication, is a communication \norganization or an institutionalized person. By a communication \norganization we mean a newspaper, a broadcasting network or sta- \ntion, a film studio, a book- or magazine-publishing house. By an \ninstitutionalized person we mean such a person as the editor of a \nnewspaper, who speaks in his editorial columns through the facili- \nties of the institution and with more voice and prestige than he \nwould have if he were speaking without the institution. \nThe organization works exactly as the individual communicator \ndoes. It operates as decoder, interpreter, and encoder. On a news- \npaper, for example, the input to be decoded flows in through the \nnews~ wires and the reporters. It is evaluated, checked, amplified \nwhere necessary, written into a story, assigned headline and position, \nprinted, distributed. This is the same process as goes on within an \nindividual communicator, but it is carried out by a group of \npersons rather than by one individual. The quality of organization \nrequired to get a group of reporters, editors, and printers working \ntogether as a smooth communication unit, decoding, interpreting, \n', "128 E F F E C T S  O F  M A S S  C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \nand encoding so that the whole operation and product has an indi- \nvidual quality, is a quite remarkable thing. W e  have become so \naccustomed to this performance that we have forgotten how re- \nmarkable it is. \nAnother difference between the communication institution and \nthe individual communicator is that the institution has a very high \n• ratio of output to input. Individuals vary, of course, in their output- \ninput ratios. Persons who are in the business of communicating \n(preachers or teachers, for example) ordinarily have higher ratios \nthan others, and so do naturally talkative persons who are not pro- \nfessional communicators. Very quiet persons have relatively higher \ninput. But the communication organization is so designed as to be \nable to encode thousands--sometimes millions---of identical messages \nat the same time. To  carry these, intricate and efficient channels \nmust be provided. There have to be provisions for printing and \ndelivering thousands of newspapers, magazines, or books, for making \nprints of a film and showing them in hundreds or thousands of \ntheaters, for translating sound waves into electricity and distributing \nit through wires and through the air to millions of receiving sets. \nThe receivers Of mass communication are individuals at the ends \nof these channels---individuals reading the evening paper, looking \nthrough the new magazine, reading the new book, sitting in the \nmotion-picture theater, turning the dial on the radio set. This \nreceiving situation is much different from that which pertains in \nface-to-face communication, for one thing, because there is very \nlittle direct feedback from the receivers to the sender. The receiver \nwho, in a face-to-face situation, will nod his head and smile or \nfrown while the sender is speaking, and then encode a reply himself, \nwill very seldom talk back to the radio network or write a' letter \nto the editor. \nThe kind of feedback that comes to a mass communication or- \nganization is a kind of  inferential expression--receivers stop buying \nthe publication, or no longer listen to the program, or cease to buy \nthe product advertised. Only in rare instances do these organizations \nhave an opportunity to see, more directly than that, how their mes- \nsages.are going over. That.is one reason why mass communication \nconducts so much audience research, to find out what programs are \nbeing listened to, what stories are being read, what advertisements \n", 'S C H R A M N I  12 9 \nare attended to. It is one of their few substitutes for  the feedback \nwhich makes interpersonal communication so \'relatively easy to plan \nand control. \nThe  following chapters will have something to say about the \naudiences of the different media; therefore, we need not discuss \nthem in  any detail here. These audiences cluster no t only around \nthe newspaper, the magazine, or the television station but also \narofind certain stories in the paper, certain parts of the magazine, \ncertain television or radio programs. For  example, Station A will \nnot have the same audience at eight o \'clock as it had at seven o\'clock, \nbecause some of these listeners will have moved to Stations B and C, \nand some of the listeners f rom B and C will have moved to A. \nNewspaper  D will not have the same audience on its sports pages \nas on its society pages, although there will be some overlap. W h a t  \ndetermines which offering of mass communication will be selected \nby  any given individual? Perhaps the easiest way to put  it is to say \nthat choice is determined by  the "fraction of selection": \nExpectation of Reward \nEffort Required \nYou can increase the value of that fraction either by increasing \nthe numerator  or decreasing the denominator, which is to say that \nan individual is more likely to select a certain communication if it \npromises him more  reward or requires less effort  than comparable \ncommunications. You can see how this works in your  own experi- \nence. You are much more likely to read the newspaper or maga- \nzine at hand than to walk six blocks to the newsstand to buy  a \npreferred newspaper or magazine. You are more likely to listen to \na station which has a loud, clear signal than to one which is faint \nand fading and requires constant effort from yo u to hear the pro- \ngram. But if the. big game of the week is on that faint station, or \nif your  favorite author is in the magazine at the newsstand, then \nthere is more likelihood that you  will make the additional effort. \nIf  you  were a member of the underground in occupied France \nduring W or ld  W a r  II, you  probably risked your  life to hear news \nfrom the forbidden Allied radio. You aren\'t  likely to stay up until \n2:oo a.M. simply to hear a radio program, but if by  staying up that \n', "130 E F F E C T S  OF M A S S  C O M M U N I C A T I O N  \nlong you can find out how the Normandy  invasion is progressing \nor who has won the presidential election--then you will probably \nmake the extra effort just as most of the rest of us did. It is hardly \nnecessary to point out that no two listeners may have exactly the \nsame fraction of selection. One of them may expect more reward \nfrom Milton Berle than will the. otherl One of them may consider \nit less effort to walk six blocks to the newsstand than does the other. \nThe  significant fact is that the audience of mass communication in \nany given situation is determined by the way  this fraction of selec- \ntion looks to the interested individuals. \nUnlike lecture audiences and small groups, mass communication \naudiences (with the exception of the people in a motion-picture \ntheater at the same time) have very little contact with each other. \nPeople in one house listening to Jack Benny don't  know whether \nanybody in the next house is listening to him or not. A person \nreading an editorial in the New York Times has little group feeling \nfor the other people in this country who read editorials in the Ne.,v \nYork Times. These audiences are individuals, rather than groups. \nBut each individual is connected with a group or groups---his family, \nhis close friends, his occupational or school group---and this is a very \nimportant thing to remember about mass communication. \nThe more we study it, the more we are coming to think that \nthe great effects of mass communication are gained by feeding ideas \nand information into small groups through individual receivers. In \nsome groups, as you well know, it is a sign of status to be familiar \nwith some part of mass communication (for example, in the teen- \nage group to hear the currently screamable crooner, or in some \nbusiness groups to read the Wall Street Journal). In many a group, \nit is a news story from the radio, or an editorial from the Times, \nor an article from the Tribune, or an article from one of the big \nmagazines, that furnishes the subject of conversation on a given day. \nThe story, or article, or editorial is then reinterpreted by the group, \nand the result is encoded in group, opinion and perhaps in group \naction. Thus, it may well be that the chief influence of mass com- \nmunication on individuals is really a kind of secondary influence, \nreflected to the group and back again. \nW e  are ready now to draw a diagram of mass communication \nand to talk about the kind of messages this sort of system requires \n", "S C H  R A M / ~ I  , , 1 3 1  \nand what we know about predicting their effects. T h e  way  mass \ncommunication seems to work is illustrated below. \nInput from \nnews $ourcC.~ \nar t  sources, etc. \nlnfcrvndal feedback \nT h c  Umass a ~ c n c c ' :  \nmany receivers, each \ndecoding, interpret- \ning, encoding-- each \nc o n n e c t e d  w i t h  a \ngroup, where message \nis re in terpre ted and \nof ten  acted upon.  \nIt is easy to see that there will be certain restrictions on the kinds \nof program which can be carried over these identical circuits to \nthese little-known and changing audiences. The  communication or- \nganization knows it is dealing with indiv!duals, yet  it does not know \nthem as individuals. Its audience-research classifies rather than indi- \nvidual'izes the audience. Tha t  is, audience-research says that so \nmany people are listening at a given time, that so many men and \nso many women are likely to read a given kind of article, or that \nthe readers of a given magazine are in the upper  economic bracket \nand have had, on the average, twelve years of schooling. Whereas \nthe individual communicator  is dealing with individuals and is able \nto watch the way  his message is received and may modify  it, if \nnecessary, the organization is dealing only with averages and classes. \nIt  must pitch its reading level somewhere below the estimated aver- \nage of its audience, in o rde r  not  to cut off too many of the lower \nhalf of the audience. It must choose its content  according to the \nbest estimate it can make of  what  the broadest classes of receivers \nwant and need. Whereas the individual communicator  is free to \nexperiment because he can instantly correct  any mistake, the or- \nganization is loathe to experiment. W h e n  it finds an apparently suc- \ncessful formula, it keeps on that way;  or it changes the details but  \nnot  the essentials. If  one institution makes a great success with a \n", '132 E F F E C T S  O F  M A S S  C O M I V I U N I C A T I O N  \ngiven kind of message, others tend to copy  i t - -no t  because o f  any \nlack of originality but because this is one of the few kinds of  feed- \nback available f rom the mass audience. Tha t  is w h y  we have so \nmuch sameness on the radio, w h y  one successful comic strip tends \nto be followed by  others of the same kind, one successful news or \ndigest magazine by  others, one kind of comedy program by  others \nof the same kind, and so forth. \nW h a t  can we say about the effects of these mass-communication \nmessages? For  one thing, mass communication has pervasive effect \nbecause in many respects it has taken over the function of society \ncommunicating. Our society, like any other communication unit, \nfunctions as decoder, interpreter,  and encoder. It  decodes our en- \nvironment for  us, watches the horizon for  danger and promise and \nentertainment. It  then operates to interpret  what  it has decoded, \nhelps us arrive at a consensus so that we can put  policy into effect, \nhelps us keep the ordinary interactions of communal life going, as \nillustrated by the accompanying diagram. \nSociety as \ncommunicator \n~ " - -  S u r v e y s  e n v i r o n m e n t  \n~ - -  Transmits culture and policy \nOur  society helps us enjoy life. It also encodes--messages to \nmaintain our  relations with other  societies in the world, a n d  m•s- \nsages to transmit our  culture to its new members. Mass communica- \ntion, which has the power  to extend our  eyes and ears almost in- \ndefinite distances and to multiply our voices and wri t ten words as \nfar as we can find listeners or readers, has taken over a large share of \nthe responsibility for  this social communication. Newspapers , \' radio,  \nand television watch the horizon for  us. By telling us what  our  \nleadersand experts think, by  conducting a discussion of public issues, \nthese media, and magazines and films as well, help us interpret what  \n', 'S C H R A N I M  \'33 \nis seen on the horizon and help us decide what to do about it. The \ntextbook and educational film have led all the other media in \nencoding our culture so that the young persons coming into Our \nsociety may learn as quickly and easily as possible the history, \nstandards, roles, and skills they must know in order to b e g o o d  \nmembers of society. \nThis is not to say that all the media do not contribute in some \ndegree to all these functions. For example, a book like Orwell\'s \nz984 may be as much a report of the horizon as the most current \nnews story. On the other hand, it is certainly true that a great deal \nof our culture is transmitted currently through television, radio, \nnewspapers, and magazines. But the faster:media are better equipped \nto be watchmenand are more often so used. The slower, longer- \nlasting media are better equipped to be teaching aids and are so used. \nThe important thing for the teacher to realize is that all the mass \nmedia have important uses in provid!ng the network of understand- \nings without which the modern large community could not exist. \nSo much for the basic effect, which we see every day in the \ncustoms around us, the peOple and problems talked about, and the \nlanguage we speak. This is the slow, imperceptible effect. This is \nlike building the stalagmite. But how about the specific effect of \na given message transmitted by mass communication? How can \nwe predict what the effect will be on the  mass audience? \nWe can\'t predict the effect on the mass audience. W e  can "only \npredict the effect on individuals. Communication organizations have \ndeveloped group encoding, but there is only individual decoding. \nTherefore, we can predict the effect of mass communication only \nin the way We try to predict the effect of other communication-- \nthat is, in terms of the iiateraction of message, situation, personality, \nand group. Inasmuch as there are mfiny different combinations of \npersonality, situation, and group in any mass audience, there are \nlikely to be many different kinds of effects. It is equally obvious \nthat, since mass communication doesn\'t know much about the indi- \nviduals in its audience, predicting effects is going to be extremely \ndi~cult .  \nNevertheless, there are certaiw things to be said. T h e  problem \nof attention constantly faces mass communication. The average \n', '\' 3 4  E F F E C T S  O F  M A S S  C O M M U N I C A T I O I ~ I  \nAmerican probably gives four or five hours a day to mass com- \nmunication. If he lives in a big city, he gets a paper that would \nitself take half that time to read. He is offered the equivalent of \ntwo weeks of radio and television every day, from which he can \nchoose. He is offered a bewildering array of magazines and boolcs \nand films. From these, also, he must choose. Other attractive ways \nto spend leisure competewith communication. He sometimes com- \nbines them---Ustening to music while he reads, playing cards or \neating while he hears a r~ewscast, playing with the baby while he \nwatches television. \nWc can, therefore, predict at least that any individual will have \na fairly small chance of selecting any given item in mass communi- \ncation and that, if he does select it, his level of attention may be \nrather low. This is responsible for many cases of "mishearing" radio. \nWe know also that readership of the average newspaper story falls \noff sharply after the first few paragraphs, so that a member of the \nmass audience is likely not to see at all the latter part of a long \nnewspaper story. \nThere are, of course, many cases in which markedly high atten- \ntion is aroused by mass communication and plentiful instances of \nlisteners identifying themselves closely with radio characters and \nadopting the mannerisms and language of movie heroes. It has been \nsaid that the mass media have brought Hollywood, Broadway, and \nWashington nearer than the next town, and there is a great deal of \ntruth in this. There are, also, some cases in which very spectacular \novert results have been accomplished by mass communication. \nLet us recall one of them. Can you remember when CBS broad- \ncast Orson Welles\' performance of H. G. Wells\' ~War of the \nWorlds? The script featured the invasion of the United States by \narmies from outer space. Perhaps you were one Of the people who \nran screaming for the hills, or armed yourself to wait for the in- \nvaders, or tried to call your loved ones long distance for a farewell \ntalk. Or perhaps you were not. Perhaps you were one of those \nwho heard the CBS announcers explain carefully that it was a play \nmade from a book of fiction. Those who didn\'t hear those announce- \nments were engaged in proving what we have just said about the \nlow level of attention to  some parts of mass communication. \n', "S C H R A M M  I35 \nBut that doesn't entirely expla!n why people became hysterical \nand did things they were rather ashamed of the next day. And, in \ntruth, this is one of the really spectacular examples of mass-com- \nmunication effect. This happened without any specific reference to \ngroups; it happened spontaneously in thousands of homes near the \nsupposed scene of invasion. W h y  did it happen? Research men \nhave studied the incident and think they have put together the \npuzzle. For one thing, it was a tense time. People were full of \nanxiety, which could have been triggered off in many ways. In \nthe second place, people trusted--still trust--radio news; the play \nwas in the form of newscasts and commentaries. Therefore, the \ncommunication, as it was interpreted, really represented a spec- \ntacular change in the situation: The Martians were invading! \nApparently the group element played no large part in this event, \nbut the other three did. The message was accepted (minus the im- \nportant identification as fiction). The receivers had a good deal of \nanxiety ready to be used. The message convinced them that the. \nsituation had indeed changed for the worse. Each, according to his \nown personality and situation, then took action. \nAs we have said, this was, fortunately, one of the few really \nspectacular examples of mass behavior. Another was the gold rush \nthat resulted when the newspapers, in the I890'S brought word of \ngold in Alaska. Some people might say that what the Communists \nhave been able to accomplish is a spectacular advertisement for the \npower of mass communication, and this interpretation is w o r t h  \nconsidering because it shows us n o t  only some of the differences \nbetween the way we use the mass media and the way dictators \nuse them but also some of the principles of communication effect. \nOne of the first acts of the Communists , when they take over a \ncountry, is to seize the mass-communication system. (That was also \none of Hitler's first acts.) They also seize the police power and the \ncontrol of productive resources, and the)r organize an intricate \nsystem of party groups and meetings. I don't know of any case in \nwhich the Communists have put the whole burden of convincing \npeople and gaining members on mass communications alone. They \nalways provide a group structure, where a convert can get r e i n -  \nforcement, and meetings, to which a potential convert can be drawn. \n", "~36 E F F E C T S  O F  M A S S  C O M I ~ , ~ U N I C A T .  I O N  \nThey use mass media of communication almost as an adjunct to \nthese groups. In Korea and China, the mass media actually become \ntexts for the groups. And the Communists do one thing more. If \nat all possible, they secure a monopoly on the mass-communication \nfacilities which reach the people whom they are taking ore/'. When \nthey took Seoul, Korea, in 1 9 5 o  , they confiscated radio receivers \nwherever they found receivers, despite the fact that they had cap- \ntured intact Radio Seoul, the most powerful transmitter in that part \nof Asia. They were willing to give up the use of Radio Seoul, i f  \nby so doing they could keep their subjects from listening to foreign \nradio programs. \nA state monopoly on communication, as well as control of \nresources and organization of a police state, is obviously a long way \nfrom our American system. As long as our mass media are per- \nmitted free criticism and reporting, and as long as they represent \nmore than one political point of view, We have little to worry \nabout in a political way from them. But even though we may look \nwith revulsion at the Communist way of using mass communication, \nstill we can study it. Let us refer back to the four elements which \nwe said were instrumental in bringing about communication effects \n--message, situation, personality, and group. The Communists con- \ntrol the messages• By their police power, control of resources (and, \nhence, of food and pay), they can structure the situation as they \nsee fit. Their group organization is most careful and offers a place-- \nin fact compels a place--for every person. Thus, they control three \nof the four elements and can use those three to work on the fourth \n-- the personalities of their receivers. \nThe Commuhists, who have now had thirty-five years' practice \nin the intensive use of mass communication for accomplishing speci- \nfied effects, are apparently unwilling to predict the results of their \ncommunication unless they can control three of the four chief ele- \nments which enter into the effect. \nLet us take one final example. There is a great deal of violence \nin mass-communication content today. Violence is interesting to \nchildren. Yet only a few children actually engage in acts of crim- \ninal violence. Most children do no such things. They sample the \nviolent material and decide they would rather play football. Or \nthey attend faithfully to the violent material, use it to clear out \n", 'S C H R A i ~  ]X\'I i37 \nvicariously some of the aggressions they have been building up, and \nemerge none the worse for the experience. Or they adopt some of \nthe patterns in a mild and inoffensive way when they play cops and \nrobbers. Only a few children learn, from the mass media, tech- \nniques of crime and violence which they and their pals actually try \nout. Now what is it that determines which of those children will \nbe affected harmfully by those messages of violence and which \nwill not? \nWe can answer this question fairly well from cases we have \nstudied. And the answer is simply that the other three elements-- \npersonality, situation, and group influence--will probably determine \nthe use made of the message. If the child is busy with athletics, \nScouts, church, or other wholesome activities, he is not likely to \nfeel the need of violent and antisocial actions. On the other hand, \nif he is bored and frustrated, he may experiment with dangerous \nexcitement. If he has a healthy personality, if he has learned a \ndesirable set of values from his family group, he is less likely to \ngive in tO motivation toward violence. On the other hand, if his \nvalue standards are less certain, if he has lost some of his sense of \nbelonging and being loved (possibly because of a broken home), \nhe may entertain more hospitably the invitation to violence. If the \ngroup he admires has a wholesome set of standards, he is not likely \nto try an undesirable response, because the group will not reinforce \nit. On the other hand, if he belongs to a "gang," there is every \nreason t o  expect that he will try some of the violence, because in \nso doing he will win admiration and status in the group. There- \nfore, what he does will depend on the delicate balancing of these \ninfluences at a given time. Certainly no one could predict from \nmerely seeing such a message exactly what the response to it would \nbe. Moreover, it is entirely probable in the case we have mentioned \nthat the community, the home, and the school--because they influ- \nence so greatly the other three elements--would have much more \nto do with the young person\'s response than would the message \nitself. \nThe all-pervasive effect of mass communication, the groundswell \nof learning that derives from mass communication acting as society \ncommunicating--this we can be sure of, and over a long period \nwe can identify its results in our lives and beliefs. The more specific \n', 'I38 EFFECTS OF MASS COMMUNICATION \neffects, however, we must predict only with caution and never \nfrom the message alone without knowing a great deal about the \nsituation, the personality, and the group relationship where the \nmessage is to be acted upon. \n']</pre>
