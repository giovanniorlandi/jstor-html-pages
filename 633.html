        <pre>['SctnorniL\nii, pV : n■ *;;Hi * tey \'\nVOL 38.\nSTOP SUCH\n■ PUBLICATIONS\nIf the Department of Justice is\nin possession of information that\nRussian Soviet interests are be\nhind the agitat\'an for race trou\nbles in this country, then the du\nty of the department is marked\nout f< r it by the discovery. News\nreports from Washington tell us\nthat money received from Russia\nis being used to establish news\npapers in this country, whose\nside purpose is to arouse racial\nImtred. It should not be a dilli\ncult matter to convict these pro\npagandists of violence of a con\nspiracy to disturb the peace and\norder of the country.\nIt has been openly charged\nthat the Russian soviets, acting\nthrough the I. W. W. in this\ncountry, were responsible for the\nrecent racial outbreaks in Wash\nington and Chicago. There is\nhardly a doubt also that violence\nhas been encouraged by certain\nnewspapers who have been prea\nching racial hatred. All of these\npublications are just as disloyal\nto this government as were cer\ntain ot the German language\nnewspapers whose plants were\nseized and closed during the war\nSuch papers are encouraging\nwhat in effect would be internal\nwar. For the peace and well be\ning of the country and the ue\ngroes themselves, preaching of\nviolence sboifld be stbplEPd {, t\nonce and forever.\nThere is no reason why the rac\nes in this country can not live in\nharmony and good will—none ex\ncept the professional agitators.\nThe recent events in Washington\nand Chicago are living proofs of\nthis fact. Instead of mistru-t\nand hatred, all races in this coun\ntry Anon id be taught that they\ncan exist together peacefully and\nprofitably. A respect for law\nand order and the rights of each\nother should be sullicient for the\ncontinuance of peace and pros\nperity. Anyone who preachers\nan opposite doctrine is a menace\nto the country The sooner the\npower for evil of such persons is\neffectively curbed the better it\nwill be lor all concerned. —Com-\nmercial Appeal.\nThe Department of Justice\ncould make a good start in this\nstate on such publications.\nA CARD\nTo My Many Friends and\nVoters of Neshoba County\nDear Brethen :—I take this met\nhod through the dear old Demo\ncrat in tendering my heart felt\nthanks to one and all for the\nmany votes and help you gave\nme on August 26th. I have no\nfeeling in the world toward any\none who did not support me. I\nknow they are my friends even\nthough they desired to vote fo r\nmy opponent who is a peifect\nChristian gentleman and I will\ntry and use the trust committed\nto rny care in a way-that all will\nbe glad of my service at the end\nof the term. Again thanking all\nlor your support, lam your\nfriend and servant.\nJ. O. Long.\nFurnished Room Wanted —Ave\nry desirable family from ‘the\nNorth-west is coming to Phila\ndelphia for the winter.

C T Rand.\nSERGEAHt LEO TAKLOR\nLaredo, Tex. i Promotions\nhave come rapidly to Supply Ser\ngeant Leo Taylor, sou of Mr. B.\nTaylor of Plattsburg since he en\nlisted for service in the army and\nin addition to the increased rank\nand pay he has received, Serg\neant Taylor has been deriving\nmental and physical benefits from\nthe army continually. His opin\nion of the army is shown more\nclearly by his recent re-enlist\nment than it could be by any\nother thing.\nSergeant Taylor enlisted after\na state of war was declared to\nexist between Germany and the\nUnited States. He was then a\nprivate. Within a few months\nhe was promoted to private first\nclass, and in 1918 he was made a\ncorporal\nEarly this year he was promot\ned to the grade of sergeant, and\nwas assistant to the Supply ser\ngeant of Company B. 67th Inf an\ntry. When the supply sergeant\nwas discharged, Sergeant Taylor\nsucceeded to his place and now\nhas charge of all the arms and\nequipment of the nearly 150 men\nof the company.\nSergeant Taylor obtained his\npromotions by sheer merit. He is\nregarded as one of the most de\n\'pendable non-commissioned offi\ncer of his regiment.\nIn addition to the increased\nrank and pay that his promotions\ngive him, he has been constantly\nlearning things that will be of\nbenefit to him, not only inside\nthe army but out of it. The man\nwho can keep accurate “Tab’’ on\nthe numberless pieces of equip\nment that belong to a company of\nInfantry should be just as valu\nable in business as he is in the\narmy.\nBesides that, if Sergeant Tay\nlor feels a desire to learn any vo.\ncation that he has never had be\nfore, he has the privilege of noti\nfying his officers and receiving\ntraining in almost anything that\nhe may desire. A number of vo\ncational schools are being condu\ncted in the Thirty-seventh Infan\ntry and these are all in charge of\nof competent men.\nSergeant Taylor does not in\ntend at present to remain in the\narmy permanently. He has seen\nenough of it, however, to realize\nits value as a training for other\nwork, and when asked to outline\nhis reasons for re-enlisting, that\nwas one of the principal reasons\nhe gave—that his service in the\narmy would prove valuable train\ning for outside work.\nSergeant Taylor recently retur\nned to Plattsburg for a brief vis\nit to his friends and relatives and\nthat visit exemplifies another of\nthe advantages of the army—for\nduring his visit he was on lull\npav, aijd received a sum suffici\nent to cover his living expenses\nduring the thirty days of his ab\nsence from the regiment in addi\ntion to his pay.\nFOR SALE—O.

MISS. THURSDAY, SEPT. 4, 1959\nIN MEMORY\nOn tlie morning of April sth\n1910 the death angel came to the\nhome of Bro. and Sister Davis\nand carried back with him to\nmake Heaven brighter the sweet\nspirit of little 11a Francis. Her\nstay with them was short She\nwas tive years old but what plea\nsure and sweet companionship\nthose five short years afforded\nthe parents and loved one sweet\nand obedient with an ever ready 7\nsmile, so cheerful, making life in\nthe home brighter by her sweet\nsunny disposition. Little 11a\nFrances will be missed in the\nhome but how much brighter\nHeaven is now since her sweet\nlittle presence is added to the\ngreat collection of choice little\njewels already there. She was\nsick just a week. How tenderly\nthe loved ones together with Urs.\nLand and Seale attended her try\ning to keep her with us but Hod\nsaid, “Suffer her to come unto\nme.” He needed her to shine up\nthere. How bright Heaven must\nbe for God\'s Kingdom is made up\nof sweet little gems like 11a Fran\nces. We will miss her in the\nhome, the loved ones and friends\nwill miss her but we must not\ngrieve for God loaned her to us\nto let us know how bright His\nkingdom was and how pure and\nlet us all strive to reach that dear\nplace. Father and mother you\nhave a greater interest there now\nsince you know your darling is\n\'reaching opt her dear little hands\nfor you, waiting to welcome you\nHow sweet it is when we stand\naround the cold form of these lit\ntie ones to know that they are\nnot dead but sweetly sleeping in\nthe arms of Jesus. We can h ive\nno doubts about them knowing\nthey were free from all vice, nev\ner having been contaminated with\nsin, we know they are safe. May\nGod help the parents bear their\nloss and to sav “Thy will Lord\nnot ours be done.”\nJ. C- Long.\nA CARD\nTo the People of Neshoba Cos:\nI take this method of thanking\nyou for the uniformly good treat\nment and splendid hospitality ac\ncorded me in the recent political\ncampaign and during my fifteen\nmonths of service as your Supt.\nof schools.\nNow that the campaign is over\nand I have lost, by a small maj\nority, 1 wish to thank my friends\nfor their support and manifesta\ntion of confidence. Ido not feel\nhumiliated by defeat, but rather\ndo I feel honored to have receiv\ned such a good vote in opposition\nto a man so popular as my oppo\nnent.\nThe personal benefits that 1\nreceived from meeting the people\nof the county in this campaign\nfar outweigh any sacrifice that I\nmade; therefore Ido not regret\nhaving entered the race. Neither\ndo I regret having made the race\nupon a progressive platform with\nspecial emphasis upon the need\nof rural education. The only way\nby which we can ever be liberat\ned from the shackles of our op\npresßors,-the autocrats and the\nprofiteers,-is thru the training of\nour youths so that they may be\nable to hold their own in the\nstruggle for existence.\nAsa proof of my conviction on\nthis point 1 here mention the\nfact that I expect to spend the\ndoming year as a student in the\nState University. In order to be\npres?nt at the opening of the ses\nsion it is necessary that 1 resign\nthe office of Supt. of Education\nPatience, Tolerance and Triumph.\n■ **% I\n- -f L - \' V \',- —•’\nA- - made to -;\nmeet yoijr taste! ji\n\\ x >\' \\ Camels are qflei uas a cigarette entirely\n| , \\ out of 1 ,—a flavor and smoothness\nL®& \' never bl gra iced.
