        <pre>['Published December, 1958\nAGRONOMY JOimNAL \nVolume 50 December 1958 Number 12 \nUnfinished Business1 \nW. M. Myers2 \nMAN has ever been concerned about food. Freedom \nfrom want is one of his most cherished hopes. And \nfood is one of his most basic needs. Therefore, adequacy \nof food supply is essential to man\'s freedom from want, \nand the field crops are the key to adequate food supplies. \nThe major part of man\'s food comes directly from the \nfield crops or indirectly from them through the livestock \nthat consume them. Increased food supplies mean, therefore,\nincreased requirements for field crop production either \nthrough the use of more acres of land or through greater \nproduction per acre. \nThe agronomist has long been at the forefront of the \nforces working for greater productivity of the field crops. \nObjectives of agronomic research, education, and developmental\nprograms have always been increased productivity, \nreduction or control of production hazards, increased efficiency\nand economy of production, and improved quality. \nThese the agronomist seeks to accomplish while maintaining\nor improving our vital soil and water resources. The \nrecord of the agronomist in this regard is indeed one of \nwhich he can be proud. Time does not permit a detailed \nrecounting of this record. Perhaps it is sufficient to point \nout two things. First, the per acre production of field crops \nin the United States has increased nearly 40% during the \ncurrent century and almost all of that increase has occurred \nin the past two decades. This has been a major factor in \nenabling American agriculture to feed 60% more people \nin 1957 than in 1920 from approximately the same area \nof crop land. Furthermore, it is estimated that per capita \nfood supply in 1957 was about 10% greater than in 1920. \nIn other words, we not only fed 60% more people but we \nfed them 10% better. The second point is that today each \nfarm worker produces enough for more than 20 people. \nOnly 8 or 9% of our total labor force is occupied with \nproducing the major part of our food and fiber. Discounting\nthat part of our labor force occupied in subsistence \nfarming, we still have released for· other productive occupations\nand services 80 to 85% of our total labor force. \nThis gives the United States a vast and often overlooked \nadvantage over countries back of the Iron Curtain where \nalmost SO% of the labor force is required for agricultural \nproduction and where, even so, food and fiber supplies \nare insufficient. \n1 Contribution from the Department of Agronomy and Plant \nGenetics, University of Minnesota, St. Paul.

But neither can it be denied that \na large part of the increased productivity per acre and per \nworker can be attributed to use on the farms of the materials\nand methods developed by agronomic research and \nmade available to the farmers through our effective educational\nand developmental programs. Numbered among these \nmaterials and methods are commercial fertilizers, better concepts\nof formulations, rates and methods of fertilizer appli-\ncation, vastly improved varieties of most of the major field \ncrops, better methods of soil management, improved crop \nproduction and cultural practices, more draina&e and imgation,\nchemical and cultural control of weeds, rnsects, and \ndiseases, and many others. \nThe agronomist has indeed done his job well; in fact, \nsome say too well. We are troubled today with vast surpluses.\nThe carry-over of wheat in 195 7 was about equal \nto all domestic consumption and exports of this commodity \nfor one year. And reports indicate that the 1958 crop is the \nthird largest on record, only slightly below 1947 and 1952. \nThe corn carry-over from 1957 to 1958 was estimated at \n1.4 billion bushels compared with a total crop of 3.3 billion\nbushels in 195 7. Cotton surpluses of vast proportions \nhave also accumulated. The agricultural surpluses, particularly\nin these three crops, have overshadowed in the minds \nof the general public and of many agricultural leaders all \nother farm problems. At least one economist, pointing out \nthe effects of the surpluses on farm prices, has laid major \nresponsibility for our most pressing agricultural problems \nat the doorstep of the agronomist. He has proposed, apparently\nsincerely, that a moratorium be declared on all agro-\nnomic research. \nAdding fuel to the fire, the American public has been \nfaced with the unpleasant knowledge that the Russians have \nsurpassed us at least in some phases of engineering development\nand, according to some authorities, in the basic physi-\ncal sciences as well. This has brought about an almost hysterical\ncry for increased emphasis in the United States on \nengineering and research in the physical sciences. \nAn AAAS committee reported in 1957 as follows: "Support\nis heavily slanted toward the physical sciences. In 1954, \nfederal research support was divided as foHows: physical \nsciences, 87%; biological sciences, 11%; social sciences \n2%. Industrial research is at least as heavily weighted in \nthis direction.\'\' \nThere is grave danger that the weight of support will \ntip even further toward the physical sciences. This may \nresult from a larger proportion of new research support \nbeing channeled in that direction. It may even result from \nactual shifting of c,:urrent research support from biolo~ical \n', 'r2o AGRONOMY JOUIL~AL \nand agricultural projects to the physical sciences and engineering.\nWith the agricultural surpluses of today, the poorly \nor inadequately informed might well agree that this would \nbe a desirable move. Although not directly related to actual \nresearch support, the highly discriminatory action of the \nUnited States Civil Service Commission in advancing only \ncertain da.ssesoof scientists to the tops of their grades is \nonly a symptom of this kind of thinking. Most categories \nin which our members are employed were among those discriminated\nagainst. \nFrom where we stand today, it is indeed difficult to obtain \na proper perspective of the continuing need for agronomic \nresearch, education, and development--of the unfinished \nbusiness that remai_ns. Our vision is too likely to be obscured \nby the piles of cotton, wheat, and corn. But let us rise above \nour present place in time and space to get an unobstructed \nview of the events of today. From this position let us also \ntry to see the road into the future and the far places of the \nworld berond the boundaries of North America. \nFrom our new position, we see three important things. \nFirst, vast as our surpluses seem to be, our total agricultural\nproduction exceeds our domestic consumption and \nexports by only 3 to 4%. Important as this margin is in \nthe accumulation of surpluses and in depressing the market, \nit is indeed a narrow one, \\Y/e dare not produce less than \nwe need. Adequacy of our food and fiber resources is a \nmajor advantage we hold in the cold war. A sputnic in \nagriculture would be far more damaging to morale in this \ncountry a.nd among our allies than was the Rmsian "first" \nin the sa:ellite program. The hazards, and consequent iluctuations,\nin ·agricultural production prevent us from pro-\ndudng exactly the right amount each year. Since we dare \nnot produce too little, we must always, if we can, retain \na small margin of production over needs. \nThe second thing we see is an accelerating increase in \npopulation in the United States. In 1950, forecasts of \npopulation growth indicated that by 1975" we might have \nas many as 190 million people in this country. Already, \nonly 8 years later, we have reached 173 million and a \nrecent forecast suggests the possibility of 220 millions by \n1975, 30 million more than were foreseen 8 years ago. \nIf this forecast is correct, we will have 27% more people \n17 years hence than we have today. And this estimate may \nprove to be as much too conservative as was the estimate \nmade in 1950, for our current rate of increase is about 2% \nper annum. \nMore people to feed means increased food requirements. \nHerrell DeGraff (1957) stated, "We know we will never \nhave significantly more cropland than the number of acres \nnow under the plow. New acres .will be added by dearing, \nirrigation, and dratnage, but as many or more probably \nwill be lost to urbanization, industrial expansion, roads, \nstreets, airports, and economic abandonment." Therefore, \nany increases in food /roduction must come from higher \nyields per acre. Viewe in this light and against the background\nof population grow~h, the 3 to 4% of surplus pro· \nductive capacity we have today looks small indeed. Should \nwe have no increase in per-acre production for two years, \nthis margin of safety would be erased by the 2% increase \nin population. To keep abreast of our food needs, with \npresent rate of population increase requires that we increase \nour per-acre production at the rate of per year from \nnow on. Although this is considered by some to be a read· \nily attainable goal, we must not forget that we h;lve never \nsustained an increase in productivity of this magnitude over \na long period of time. In fact, we have equaled or exceeded \nthis rate of increase only during the war years, when farmers\nwere able to put to use accumulated information and \nmaterials developed, but relatively unused, during a half \ncentury of research. \nThe third thing we see, if we lo:Jk beyond the boundaries\nof North America, is a world full of hungry people. \nOf the present world population of 2, 700 million people, \nF AO estimates that twq-thirds--nearly 2,000 million-are \nseriously undernourished, Not more than one in a hundred \nof these people ever has a good meaL Their diets are limited\nnot only in quantity but in quality. They get little or \nno meat, fish, or milk to supplement their predominantly \nstarchy diet. Of the remaining one-third of the earth\'s population,\nabout half-one-sixth of tr.e total-are adequately \nbut not well fed and most of their daily energies are \nexpended on obtaining enough food. Only one-sixth of \nall the World\'s people are really fed well by North American\nstandards. Not only is there current need for vast \nincreases in world food production but these needs are \nintensified each year by a population growth of about \n1.6%-a total of 40 million new mouths to feed each year. \nNow, lest I seem pessimistic, let me hasten to state that \nI am confident we have the capaci:y to meet the challenge \nof more mouths to feed in the United States. We have \npotentialities for increased production with materials and \nmethods already known. There is, unfortunately, considerable\ntruth in the statement that "many of our farmer> don\'t \nfarm half as well as they know how." Average farm yields \nof most crops are still substantially below those estimated \nas possible from experimental results. The possibilities for \nincreased yield by combining the best varieties with the \nbest known fertility and cultural practices have been amply \nillmtrated in corn production in recent years in many states. \nIn few, if any, of our other major fields crops are our \nfarmers applying as much of the available scientific knowledge\nas they are in corn. Our agronomic education and \ndevelopmental programs have much unfinished business in \ncausing the research information and materials now available\nto be more widely used on farms. Such applications \nare our best insurance of adequate productivity increases \nin the years immediately ahead, for, as we well know, \nmost of the current research work can not "pay off\'" in \nimproved farm practices for several to many yeats. \nWe must not, therefore, wait until the results of research \nare needed. \\Ve must be working today on research for \nneeds which will arise one, two, or more decades hence. \nAnd there is much unfinished business in agronomic research.\nIn his brilliant address of a year ago, President \nNorman analyzed some of the deficiencies of our current \ncrops and soils research programs and pointed out some \nof the challenges and opportunities in the way ahead. He \nemphasized the need for more "mechanism" studies and \nfor the greater use of knowledge gained from such studies \nin day-to-day research on improvements in varieties and \ncultural practices of farm crops. He pointed up the enormous\nadvances in our knowied.ge of photosynthesis and \n11lluded to the potentialities of ming this knowledge in \nplant breeding and crop management research. He stressec \nthe need for greater knowledge of the growth-controllin; \nsystems in plants with the ultimate hope that ma.n mig.r \nno longer be bound by the genetic limitations of his mat \nrials in his efforts to mold and modify the morpholo, \n', 'MYERS: UNFINISHED BUSINESS 721 \nand physiological responses of crop plants. Finally he dealt \nwith the soil environment and the transcending importance \nof soil-plant relationships, an area that has had, to date, \nall too little research attention. \nSurely each of us, in his own area of specialization, \ncould cite further examples of unfinished business. For illustration,\nI will mention only a few. \nRecent advances in microbial genetics are leading us \never closer to an understanding of the biochemical nature \nand organization of the genetic materials. There awaits, \nhowever, the need for intensive research in higher plants \non methods for the manipulating and the directed changing\nof these biochemical units. With present knowledge, \ndirected mutation may seem very remote but who can say \nhow soon it will be made a reality through some new discovery.\nAnd the potentialities of using techniques analagous \nto transformation and transduction seems especially only \nto await the work of someone with vision and originality. \nSuch techniques would have a profound effect on methods \nof plant breeding. \nUtilization of heterosis through development of commercial\nhybrids-specifically hybrid corn-is often cited as one \nof the major triumphs of plant breeding in the first half \nof this century. Breeders of other crops have been seeking\nways of utilizing heterosis and some have succeeded. \nThe advantages of its utilization in a great many crops \nare obvious. Cytoplasmic male sterility has been found in \nso many species that its occurrence in many others can be \npredicted. Genomic substitution into a foreign cytoplasm \nhas been indicated as a means of creating cytoplasmic male \nsterility. And the development of a gametocide that works \non cotton forecasts the possibility of gametocides for every \ncrop. Thus one of the major difficulties in commercial production\nof hybrid seeds-emasculation of the female parent \n-would seem to be on the verge of elimination. \nIn many areas, water is or will become the ultimate limiting\nfactor in increasing production per acre. Differences \nbetween species and limited indications of genetic differences\nwithin species in efficiency of dry matter production \nper unit of water used point to this as one of the most \nfruitful areas of research. Development of varieties with \nimproved efficiency of utilization of water would raise the \nceiling on maximum yields imposed by available water. \nFor more than a quarter of a century we have known \nfrom cytogenetic researches how to create new species and \nthis has not infrequently been suggested as a plant-breeding \ntool having great potentialities. Yet there is little evidence \nfrom practical results of the successfulness of this method.· \nNo plant breeder or group of plant breeders has ever had \nthe necessary support for a research program of the required \nmagnitude to make success a reality. \nFrom these and many other examples that could be listed, \nit is evident that agronomists have not yet used all of their \nweapons nor, in fact, even their most powerful ones. With \nsuch an array of fields yet to conquer, there can hardly \nbe any doubt of the capacities of the agronomist to produce \nthe materials and methods that will make possible the \nneeded increases in production of field crops for many years \nto come. But these cannot be realized without a strong and \nadequately supported program of agronomic research. We \nmust not permit the hysterical emphasis on the physical \nsciences to result in any slackening of effort in agronomic \nresearch. We must, in fact, have more, not less, research \nsupport if we are to bring our most powerful weapons to \nbear upon the problem of increased productivity of the field \ncrops. \nAgronomists are by nature modest. We have given too \nlittle attention to informing the public of our accomplishments\nand of the unfinished business of agronomic research, \neducation, and development. But we must cease to be modest.\nNo one it better able to inform the public about these \nthings than the agronomist himself. We must speak with \n· 3000 voices if we are to have an informed public that will \nprotect its own future by insisting on more adequate support\nfor agronomy. \nAnd now, from our vantage point, let us look once \nmore beyond the boundaries of North America at the 2 \nbillion people who never have enough to eat. Why, we \nmay ask, should we in America be_ concerned about them? \nThe answer is that we cannot escape this concern. If we \nwere to paraphrase lincoln\'s famous words, we might say \nthat "A world cannot endure in peace that lives half in \nprivation and half in luxury." \nBut surely, you may say, the United States cannot feed \nall of the world\'s hungry people-we may soon have \nenough to do to take care of our own. We can, however, \nhelp them to feed themselves. The knowledge, methods, \nand materials developed from our agronomic research, \neducation, and developmental programs can continue to be \nexported to them, to their great benefit and without any \nloss to us. \nWe have, indeed, much unfinished business. \n']</pre>
