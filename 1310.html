        <pre>['RESEARCH\n1018       December 2015, Vol. 105, No. 12\nThis month, the 21st Conference of Parties of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange meets in Paris to attempt once again to reach \nan agreement on mitigation targets to reduce the now \nuniversally accepted impacts on climate change on \nthe earth system, including the social-ecological-economic system \n(SEES). While the debate to date in this forum has been focused \nmainly on providing a sound basis for mitigation action by nation \nstates, the focus will now need to turn to actionable information in a \nvariety of sectors of the SEES. One of these sectors is the health sector, \nand specifically those diseases of which the aetiology comprises an \nelement of climate as a driver of their incidence and epidemiology. \nOf particular concern are infectious diseases, vector mediated or \nother, which are likely to be affected by trending climate variability \nor climate change directly. For several decades now, as long-term \nclimate change (as distinct from shorter-term climate variability) has \nbecome a better understood and appreciated phenomenon, climate’s \npotential impact on health has received increasing attention (all time \nand space scales). While there is a broad range of potential impacts \nof climate and climate change on health (including heat tolerance \nand morbidity, for example), in this article we consider the specific \nmechanisms of the relationship between climate variability/change \nand the incidence of infectious diseases in South Africa (SA).\nExplaining climate terms\nIt is important that three inter-related but distinct notional time \nand space scales of climate dynamics be differentiated in order to \nunderstand the relationship between climate and health and how it \nmanifests. Annual seasonal periodicity manifests in typical seasonal \nweather patterns locally, and these can vary in duration and intensity \nintra- and inter-annually. For example, the frequency and intensity of \nheat waves, floods, storms, droughts, winds or even calm days, dryerthan-average\nWestern Cape winters’ impact on water availability in \nthe following summer (e.g. dam levels), or last summer’s properties \nv. this summer’s properties all vary on a range of time scales.

However, scales of climate variability and change, in space and time, are often confused and so attribution of \nimpacts on various sectors, including the health sector, can be misunderstood and misrepresented. In this review, we assess the mechanistic \nlinks between climate and infectious diseases in particular, and consider how this relationship varies, and may vary according to different \ntime scales, especially for aetiologically climate-linked diseases. While climate varies in the medium (inter-annual) time frame, this \nvariability itself may be oscillating and/or trending on cyclical and long-term (climate change) scales because of regional and global scale \nclimate phenomena such as the El-Niño southern oscillation coupled with global-warming drivers of climate change. As several studies have \nshown, quantifying and modelling these linkages and associations at appropriate time and space scales is both necessary and increasingly \nfeasible with improved climate science products and better epidemiological data. The application of this approach is considered for South \nAfrica, and the need for a more concerted effort in this regard is supported.\nS Afr Med J 2015;105(12):1018-1023.

These two notional time scales \nare commonly considered to comprise ‘climate variability’, whereas \n‘climate change’ as a phenomenon considers the changes and trends \nin the longer-term decadal to multi-decadal climate properties (on \nglobal to local space scales) and how these are likely to trend into the \nfuture. Here, the term ‘climate’ is used generically to refer to all these \ntime scales unless specified.\nUnderstanding climate in relation to \nhealth in general\nThe predictability of climate variability is important if the relationship\nbetween it and infectious disease incidence is to be determined \nretrospectively, in order to confidently predict its impact in a \nchanging or trending climate regime (i.e. medium-term climate \nvariability over climate change time scales). Several reviews have \nbeen published that have identified the importance of climate \nvariability and climate change as a factor in health and epidemiology \nin general. [1-3] Epstein[4] reviewed several examples of how climate \nchange and variability (and extreme weather events) have been \nassociated with the emergence and re-emergence of infectious \ndiseases, either directly (as a result of the biology of vector-borne \ndiseases) or indirectly by, for example, altering the hydrological \ncycle. Kolstad and Johansson[5] took a generic approach in examining \nthe potential impact of long-term climate projections on diarrhoea \nin low latitudes and showed that with the most conservative \nestimates the incidence would increase by 8 - 11% in their study \nareas, concluding that in the face of statistical climate change \nuncertainty, an urgent need for more empirical research exists. In \nmore detailed examples, the role of varying climate modes (e.g. \nENSO) and their impact on seasonal and annual climate variability \nhave been linked to variability in disease incidence.[6,7] Zell[8] pointed \nout that the relationship between climate and health is complex \nin that a range of mediated drivers influence it. While seasonal \nand inter-annual variability can explain much of the variation in \ndisease incidence in these reviewed studies, periodic outbreaks of \ndisease are more likely to be due to longer-term (inter-annual to \nmulti-decadal scale) variability via the impact of ENSO and the \nquasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) as examples. This is particularly \ndemonstrable with cases involving vector-borne infectious diseases \nwhere the agent of infection is subject to environmental life cycle \ndrivers (e.g. malaria). Zell[8] cautioned that these climatic influences \nact in concert with a range of other natural (or ecologically impacted \nclimate-mediated effects) and human-mediated drivers of disease, \nand unless concerted efforts are made to examine the contribution \nof these various drivers, they will be impossible to discern. The \nimpacts of El Niño are most obviously detectable on the west coast \nof the Pacific, and the work done by Checkley et al.[9] is an excellent \nexample of how these inter-annual phenomena can impact on \nhealth. In this case (for a particular ENSO event) they not only \nshowed a departure from ‘normal’ (or long-term average) seasonality \nof disease incidence patterns (associated with a departure from \nnormal seasonal temperature variability), but were able to calculate \nthe risk of increased disease incidence with each degree of El Niñoattributed\nwinter warming, and a monetary cost associated with \nthese effects.\nClimate variability and change in \nsouthern Africa\nThe fact that more concerted and recent climate science outputs \nin SA have revealed that trends and features of climate variability \nare indeed measurable has created an important opportunity to \ninterrogate the relationship between climate and disease in southern \nAfrica, regionally and in respective subregions. If the contribution of \nclimate variability to the variability in infectious disease incidence \ncan be determined on a range of time and space scales, the impact \nof these climate trends (both observed and projected) on health \ncan then be more accurately estimated. This would provide a basis \nfor a range of health system interventions and planning (possibly \nin synergy with those for other non-climate drivers of disease \nincidence) at appropriate time and space scales.\nAt the climate variability time scale, while the effects of ENSO are \nless consistent in southern Africa, Pohl et al.,[10] Reason et\xa0al. [11] and \nLandman and Beraki[12] show that seasonal scale climate variability \nover southern Africa is variably predictable and in some cases \n(particularly in the north-east) strongly associated with the ENSO \nstate. Lazenby et al.[13] have considered the prediction skill of \ntemperature variability at the seasonal time scale for various time \nframes (in months) and various lead times and show the utility (and \ncurrent limitations) of these predictabilities in respect of health \napplications. This is the approach adopted in a study currently \nunderway in the Mopani district of Limpopo Province which aims \nto link climate and disease models for malaria, diarrhoea and \npneumonia (Fig. 1). Given that some correlation between temperature \nand malaria incidence is apparent in the region as a whole,[14] the \nimportance of high-resolution and long-term interrogation of these \nrelationships is essential. The Infectious Diseases Early Warning \nSystem project (iDEWS) is collaboration among several SA and \nJapanese partners, which depends on this seasonal predictability skill \nto improve infectious disease management (Fig. 2).\nIn the Western Cape, this is a more complex challenge. Phillipon \net al.[15] showed that there are statistically demonstrable effects of \nENSO impacts on Western Cape rainfall (with a focus on the winter \nmonths when rainfall is highest). They contend that both trends and \ninter-annual shifts (variability) in the position and intensity of frontal \nsystems that bring rainfall to the Western Cape are mediated by ENSO \nevents. Some of these effects are also discernible at high resolution, \nsuggesting that relatively local climate impacts are long range (in \nspace and time) drivers of climate variability.[16] These studies suggest \nthat rainfall and temperature variability (and conversely the Western \nCape summer drought) do possess an element of predictability, and \nat a range of lead times.\nWhen the data set presented in Figs 3 and 4 is considered, both \nintra- and annual variability in the incidence of diarrhoea is apparent \nin the Western Cape. Table 1 shows an as yet unexplained shift in \npeak month from January to March over a four-decade period. This \nleads to the compelling question as to whether the manifestation of \nvariability in this dataset is attributable to climate variability at several \ntime (and space) scales, and if so, whether the relationship can be \nmathematically determined for application to disease management at \nshort-, medium- and long-term (climate change) time scales.\nOn the climate change time scale, analysis on observed 50-year \nclimate data trends in southern Africa has shown important \ndirectional changes with increased annual average temperatures, as \nwell as increased temperature maxima and minima both seasonally \nand on average.[17] Extreme high temperature events have increased \nsignificantly in frequency. While the trends in rainfall are less \nsignificant and weaker, they do show a tendency towards a drier \nclimate with more intense rainfall events[17] in the south and west of \nthe region, with likely impacts on daily to seasonal rainfall patterns.[18] \nModel projections of various climate scenarios are variable, possess \na high degree of uncertainty and are in some cases contradictory. \nProjections for temperature changes are more robust than those for \n', 'RESEARCH\n1020       December 2015, Vol. 105, No. 12\nprecipitation, but the accepted conclusion is that, under a high CO2 \nemissions scenario, significant temperature increases (somewhat \nameliorated in coastal areas) and a drier climate in the west of the \ncountry are predicted.[17] While the impact on the human health \nsector is considered in the long-term adaptation scenarios (LTAS),[17] \nthe need for further concerted investigation is a common cause.[19]\nWhat do we know about climate \nchange and health in SA?\nThere are very few empirical studies on the relationship between \nclimate and health conducted in SA in general; however, the topic has \nreceived attention with a range of publications in the grey literature \nand course resolution review information. One of the reasons for \nthis is a lack of comparable and consistent long-term data (a global \nconstraint on both climate and disease incidence). As stated above, \nthere is certainly adequate awareness of the potential of climate \nchange impacts on health in particular, as iterated in several articles \nand review papers.[19-22] These publications generally recognise the \ntheoretical direct and indirect impacts of climate change on health \ngenerally and infectious diseases specifically (but not exclusively), \nand suggest various adaptation measures and research challenges \nthat need to be met. The literature is therefore quite clear (both \ninternationally and locally) that the interdisciplinary approach to this \ntopic is a vital next step. One international study, the ISOTHURM \nstudy, which considered the relationship between heat and cold \nthresholds associated with mortality, included Cape Town as one of \nthe several international cities.[23] This study was mostly descriptive \nand attempted to draw global conclusions about climate drivers \n12 000\n10 000\n8 000\n6 000\n4 000\n2 000\n0\n19\n71\n19\n73\n19\n75\n19\n77\n19\n79\n19\n81\n19\n83\n19\n85\n19\n87\n19\n89\n19\n91\n19\n93\n19\n95\n19\n97\n19\n99\n20\n01\n20\n03\n20\n05\n20\n07\n20\n09\n20\n11\n20\n13\nM\nal\nar\nia\n c\nas\nes\n in\n L\nim\npo\npo\n, n\nFig. 1.

As it happened, Cape Town \nfell out as more of an exception in many \nrespects, as could have been expected given \nthe moderate Mediterranean climate, with a \npeak in mortality in the winter months due \nto respiratory illness (associated with cold \nand wet winters).\nMendelsohn and Dawson[24] analysed a \nrange of oceanographic parameters in association\nwith a cholera outbreak in KwaZulu-\nNatal in 2001 - 2002 and found a strong \nassociation of sea surface temperature, sea \nsurface height and precipitation with disease \nincidence. While the coastal trans mission \nhypothesis is specific to cholera, this study \ndoes nevertheless provide an example of how \nlocal scale environmental variability can be \nused toward developing an early-warning \nsystem for disease. Thompson et al.[25] \nstudied the relationship between disease \nand mortality and climate/weather data in \nLimpopo. They used two decades’ data for \ntheir analysis, which is insufficient to draw \nconclusions in respect of climate change \n(their claim), but is more pertinent at the \nclimate variability scale. Their conclusion \nwas that around 40% of incidence of disease \nwas attributable to climatic factors. Komen et \nal.[14] showed that, statistically, temperature \nwas a greater influence on malaria variability \nthan rainfall for the period 1998 - 2007, and \nthat long-term relationships between climate \nvariables and malaria are indicated.\nDespite the lack of precise information, \nthe National and Western Cape governments \nhave developed some policy frameworks to \naddress climate change scale impacts and \nadaptation planning specific for climatehealth\nimpacts (e.g. LTAS[17]).

Some of these studies are useful \nindicators of the increasing likely success of these approaches using \nmore sophisticated and/or tailored climate indices and more modern \nanalytical techniques and mathematical models. Cholera has had the \nmost attention in this respect, with Pascual et al.[27] considering the \ngeographical distribution of seasonality and inter-annual variability \nin the association of cholera and climate in India. Constantin de \nMagny et al.[28] conducted a study examining the association of \nspeci fic global and regional climate variability indices in relation \nto variability in cholera incidence in Ghana. Their results again \nconfirmed a strong statistical relationship between the time series \nof climate and disease periodicity and incidence and show how a \nrange of time scales (from seasons to years) can be accounted for \nby respectively associated global and local climate indices. In a \nvery useful contribution, Bandyopadhyaya et al.[29] used climatically \ndefined areas to match with the prevalence of diarrhoea in these \n(sometimes transboundary) climate zones in sub-Saharan Africa \n(not including SA). They then tested a range of variables including \nclimatic and non-climatic variables using a series of statistical tests \nbased on a linear model that accounted for the chosen variables. Their \nresults show that low rainfall in the dry season (i.e. anomalously dry) \nincreases the prevalence of diarrhoea and that an increase in monthly \naverage maximum temperature also drives up incidence, while an \nincrease in monthly minimum temperature reduces incidence. This \nis a very good demonstration of the statistical predictability of the \nimpact of climate on diarrhoeal illness. A recent study from Kenya[30] \nhas shown how important intra-annual and inter-annual seasonal \nclimate signals are in understanding malaria incidence dynamics on a \nfine temporal and spatial scale. Interestingly, results are also emerging \nthat show how contagious diseases may also have an association with \nclimate variability. Oluwole[31] deals with an example of meningitis \nepidemics in central and east Africa and their positive association \nwith medium-term climate in the form of ENSO and other climate \nmodes. He concludes that ENSO forecasts should be incorporated \ninto disease management practices.\nSeveral fairly detailed studies in other parts of the world have \nattempted to examine the association with climate variability (and \nclimate change) and diarrhoeal disease incidence, with varied \nsuccess. Bhandari et al.[32] failed to show conclusive associations \nbetween their selected medium-term climatic variables and disease \nincidence, despite trending data in both sets of parameters. This is \nlikely to be the result of methodological issues which in this case \nrelied on simple regressions (as opposed to more complex nonlinear\nmodel approaches). Other common downfalls of the analyses \nperformed include inappropriate climatic indices, poorly associated \ntime frames for the data sets (in terms of periodicity of the climate \nsignals and short time frames of the data sets), and also respective \nresolution of the data sets. Chou et al.[33] took a more comprehensive \nview in examining this approach in Taiwan and applied a climate \nvariation-guided Poisson regression model to predict the dynamics \nof diarrhoea-associated morbidity. They were able to show that \nincreased maximum temperature was the primary driver of morbidity \nin children, with days of high relative humidity and extreme rainfall \nalso contributing in other age groups. This information was useful \nin developing an early-warning system for the region. Many studies \nuse climate variability associations to make assumptions about \nlong-term climate change scale impacts. [32,34] While this is risky \nbecause of the uncertainty around climate change predictions, the \nbasic assumption is that disease incidence will trend in relation \nto trending climate variables, based on their current relationship, \ndespite a range of potentially unanticipated changes and dynamics \nin the disease aetiology and climate properties and their relationship. \nIn this respect, the contribution of Moors et al.[35] is important as the \nauthors have combined a conceptual model (which addresses the \nmechanisms of the relationship between climate and health), using an \nassessment of a range of other studies’ empirical (short-term) results, \nand long-term climate projections to make predictions on the impact \nof climate change on diarrhoeal diseases in the Ganges basin in India. \nThis approach combines different time scales and different causal \npathways and is a novel and innovative approach.\nAnother factor to consider is which agent (i.e. specific cause of infection)\nis under consideration. Most studies do not differentiate the agent \nof disease, mostly because incidence data reflect only the symptoms \nat presentation and do not include any laboratory follow-up. The \nimportance of this is illustrated by D’Souza et al.,[36] who consi dered \nthe climatic impact on rotavirus infections in children in Australia. \nThey surmise that agent-specific characteristics of transmission \nexplain why an increase in incidence of rotaviral diarrhoeal disease \ncoincides with a drop in temperature (seasonally) when children are \nconfined indoors and person-to-person transmission is facilitated.\nFinally, the statistical and modelling approach to the time series \nanalysis and the association/relationship between climate and disease \nvaries significantly among studies in the literature. This is obviously \nan important and specialised element of the research which must be \ncarefully considered with the assistance of several methodological \npublications that address this aspect.[37,38]\n7 000\n8 000\n6 000\n5 000\n4 000\nM\nal\nar\nia\n c\nas\nes\n in\n L\nim\npo\npo\n3 000\n2 000\n1 000\n0\nCa\nse\ns,\n n\n19\n76\n19\n77\n19\n78\n19\n80\n19\n81\n19\n88\n19\n89\n19\n90\n19\n91\n19\n92\n19\n82\n19\n83\n19\n84\n19\n85\n19\n86\n19\n87\n19\n93\n19\n94\n19\n95\n19\n96\n19\n97\n19\n79\n19\n98\n19\n99\n20\n00\n20\n01\n20\n02\n20\n03\n20\n04\n20\n05\n20\n06\n20\n07\n20\n08\n20\n09\n20\n10\n20\n11\n20\n12\n20\n13\n20\n14\nFig. 4.

Climate signals occur at several \nscales in space and time and the appropriately scaled information \nshould be used to investigate the covariance of climate signals and \ndisease incidence. This means that cognisance of the responses of \ndisease to short-, medium- and long-term climate signals must be \nconsidered. The study of the relationship between climate and disease \n(infectious and other) is also dependent on good epidemiological \ndata that can be aggregated and disaggregated at the right time and \nspace scales to match with the occurrence of those of the climate \nsignals. It is clear, however, that if effective management of climatedriven\ndiseases is to be effected, especially in the light of trending and \nchanging climate signals, and where this component of the aetiology \nof these diseases is set to become more intense with time, urgent and \nconcerted research should be directed at quantifying this relationship \nfor the past and present, in order to increase confidence of predicting \nthe impact of these trends and changes in the future.\nReferences\n1.
