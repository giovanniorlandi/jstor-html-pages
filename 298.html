Of this number\n*120, 80 men and 40 women, are;\nconfined in the penitentiary; 153\n, at tha State farms and four on\nthe county chaingang.\nThe McDuffie county contest\nwill be brought before the State\nboard of canvassers today.

Moore/ ot South\nCarolina, who was in Washihgton\nfor several days straightening\nout the trouble with the South\nCarolina militi^, caused by exGov.\nBlease disbanding the\ntroops, returned home Friday\nnight. Gen. Moore was in\nference> several times with the\nofficials of the war department\nand stated before leaving for\nhome that so far as the departmonf\nAffininln * ? ?? - J\niwiiv uiuv.iain aic L\'uiicenieu\nthere is no trouble in sight. He\nfound the secretary of war and\nthe army officers very glad to\ntalk with him about the matter\nand they assured him that the\nfullest cooperation of the federal\nauthorities would be extended\nthe South Carolina troops.\nThe only real question about\nthe matter, according to what\nGen. Moore said, is whether or\nnot the order, issued by ex-Gov.\nBlease is legal. This ques^n is\nnow being examined by^^ood\nlegal talent. If the Blease order\nis illegal, that settles it and\nGov. Manning can rescind it,\nthus restoring the troops to their\nformer ritatus\nIf, on the other hand, the order\nis declared to be legal, then the\ndifferent companies must be reorganized.\nWhile this will cause\nmuch additional work to fall on\nthe office of the adjutant general\nfor a few months, every thing\nwill go on as usual after the reorganization\nwork has been\ncompleted.\nGen. Moore does not "take the\nsituation at all seriously and said\nr.hat in either case the most\ninjury that would come to the\nNational Guard of South Carolina\nby the Blease order would\nhe a temporary inconvenience.\nThere will be no delay in holding\nthe inspections throughout the\nState and within a few months,\nat most, everything should be in\ngood working order again, even\nshould the Blease order be de\nviui^u ir^cii.\nThousands Die in Earthquake.\nFrom 25,000 to 50,000 remains\nthe unofficial estimate of casualties\nin the earthquake that rocked\nSouthern and Central Italy early\nlast Wednesday morning. The\namount of damages to property\nprobably will never be known.\nSuch details as have been made\nknown, however, leave no doubt\nthat fully 100 towns and villages\nwere utterly demolished or partly\nwrecked and that the loss of\nlife was great..\nScores of people Monday remained\nbeneath the crumbled\nbuildings throughout the earthquake\nzone, some of whom were\nthought to have still been alive.\nLee Breaks Two Records.\nThe following from the Birmingham\n(Ala.) Ledger of the\n4th will be read with interest by\nthe t>eople of Fort Mill and vicinitv:\n"Having become a slave to the\nhabit, T. K. Lee, of the Birmingham\nAthletic club rifle team, has\nmade two new world\'s records\nwith his trusty rifle. Lee has\njust shot two more possibles,\nmaking nine consecutive possibles.\n"Last week Lee shot his seventh\nconsecutive possible (200\nshots) this season, breaking the\nworld\'s record established by\nhim the previous season. In the\ntwo matches for this week, Lee\nn^-st made an eighth possible in\nthe Arms and the Man match,\nand then followed that up with\nhis ninth possible in the National\nRifle association match. Thus\nLee has broken two world\'s records\nthis week and each time\nestablished a jiew world\'s record."\nj\nMUST ANSWER CHARGE\nOF FORT MILL ROBBERY\nThomas Nolan,. alias ^Pennsylvania\nTom," who was paroled\nby Gov. Blease and immediately\nrearrested at the penitentiary on\nJanuary was given a preliminary\nhearing here Thursday \'\nbefore Magistrate Robert P.\nHarris.

Inspector Gregory examined\nthe witnesses for the\nState, and they were crossexamined\nby Nolan. Both the\ninspector and the defendant\nmade brief arguments op the\nconclusion of the testimony.\nFour witnesses were sworn |\nlor the JState. W. B. Meacham,\npresident of the Savings Bank\nof Fort Mill, testified that the\nfront door of the bank was\nforced open during the night of\nSeptember 29, 1902, vault and\nsafe doors blown open. The\nmoney lost "by the burglary was\n3,690.36, including a considerable\nquantity of new coins consisting\nof Columbian half dollars, dimes\nand nickles. Some jewelry was\nalso secured.\nA. A.

BLE4SE RESUMED [\nSUCCEEDED BY SMITIT I\nPerhaps the greatest surprise\nof the administration of Cole L. 1\nBlease was the announcement of 1\nhis resignation as Governor of\nSouth Carolina, which was <\nflashed over the wires Thursday c\nafternoon. His reaiomnfinn ?pnt >\nto Secretary of State McCown,\nwas supplemented by a brief 1\nmessage to the General Assembly *\ninforming the members that it ^\nalso was tendered to them.\nLieutenant Governor Charles c\nA. Smith was immediately sworn k\nin as the State\'s Chief Executive\nto serve out the unexpired term, [\nChief Justice Gary of the State \'\nSupreme Court administering\nthe oath of office. Mr. Blease s\nand several State officials then\naccompanied Mr. Smith to the *\nGovernor\'s office. Legrand G. *\nWalker, president of the Senate, f\nautomatically succeeded to the\nLieutenant Governorship. 1\nNo previous intimation of the c\nGovernor\'s action had been 1\ngiven and no reason for it was\nassigned. The present Logis\n* - -? \' "\nmLuie is cnieny composea 01 men 1\nwho are his political opponents *\nand it was said that proposals *\nto institute impeaehment proceedings\nagainst him were made 1\nat a meeting of legislators Tues- \'\nday night but that no action was c\ntaken.\n"I hereby resign my office as\nGovernor of South Carolina" Was\nthe full communication of Gov- ^\nernor Biease to the Secretary 1\nof State. It was written by ^\nhand and in red ink. Both the a\nGovernor and his friends re- e\nfused to add anything to the f\nbrief statement.. The message 1\nto the General Assembly was v\nequally terse. c\n"I hereby tender my resigna- 0\ntion to you as Governor of the 2\nState of South Carolina." *\n"I love the pardoning power," v\nBlease once said. "I want to 0\ngive the poor devils another 11\nchance. I hope to make the ^\nnumber an even 1,000 before I ^\ngo out of office." n\nRecords show that the Gov- *\nernor surpassed even his own c\nexpectations. Just before re- 0\ntiring Thursday he issued 27 c\nclemency grants. Four men ^\nsentenced to life imprisonment v\nfor murder were paroled .and\nfour others received commuta- *tions.\nThursday\'s action made n\na total of 1,708 prisoners granted ^\nclemency during the Governor\'s ?\nfour years\' administration.\nFull pardon* recently were h\ngranted approximately 1,000 F\nprisoners who previously had a\nbeen paroled, this action re- \'r\nstoring their citizenship. Super- (j\nintendent D. J. Griffith of the State\npenitentiary, said that less J\nthan 125 prisoners are now held 11\nthere.\nIn* his last message to the\nSouth Carolina Legislature last\nMonday Governor Blease said:\n"I have attained the highest\nambition of my life. My life\'s\nwork so far as my personal\ninterest is concerned, has been\ncompleted. If my people want\nmy services in future I will give\nthem, but I shall ask for nothing\nmore."\nThree Governors in Six Days.\nWith the inauguration Tuesday\nof Richard I.

And yet what a\ndifference the law makes in the\ntwo! A fellow goes into a store\nand pompously calls up the clerk\nor proprietor and orders what he\nwants, telling them that he is\nable and willing to pay his bills\nand will do so at stated periods,\nor when the bill is presented.\nHe knows that he is a liar and a\nsneak; that he has beat everybody\nwho has had to do with\nhim; that he never pays a debt\nunless he thinks it policy to do\nso in ordes to get in deeper*and\nt-Hnt whatever money he has he\nsquanders it in extravagance or\ndissipation; anyhow, he lives beyond\nhis means, or for some\nreason does not get enough to\nsupport himself or family in the\nstyle desired and instead of getting\naid from the proper sources,\nif needed, or sending his family j\nto the poor house, he picks upon j\ncertain, individuals to support j\nthem without any recompense:\nwhatever. And if this grocery\nmentioned, after going to all the\nexpense of help to Avait on this\nfellow, kook-keeping, delivering\nthe goods, etc., to say nothing of I\nthe goods themselves, wants its i\npay as promised, what does the j\nlaw say about about it? Simply\nthat if the man has a large:\namount of surplus property to be;\navailable he can be made to pay, 1\nbut if he is sharp enough to keep\nhis income collected up reason\namy close ne is responsible to!\nnobody or nothing on earth. He\nmay assess any man whom he\ncan .deceive for the support of\nhis wife or children or himself. I\nfeed them with food and dress\nthem in clothes belonging to\nif- someone else. Such is the province\nof the only American potentate.\nwho need account to no\none* the "dead beat."\nOne step won\'t take you very\nI far -you\'ve got to keep on walking;\n"one word won\'t tell folks\nwhat you are-you\'ve got to\nkeep on talking; one inch won\'t\nmako you very tall?you\'ve got\nto Keep on growing; one little\n"ad" won\'t make you rich?\nyou\'ve got to keep \'em going.\n\'\nThere was a considerable\nquantity of corn made in this\nvicinity last year al>ove the requirements\nof the farmers and\ninquiries have recently been received\nas to the quantity offering\n4 for sale by dealers in various\ncities.

In\ncounties in which a majority\nvote in favor of compulsory attendance\nis cast, the law shall\ngo into effect. ? The bill authorizes\ncounties that reject the law\nat y?e special election to vote\nupon it at subsequent general\nelections.\nThe Harper Mil says that\nChildren of the ages specified\nshall be kept in the public school\nnearest their home for the entire\nterm unless excused for physical\ni^isahilifu nr nnlouo fVtn lnl\\n? nf i\nV* U 4 VOO bkiv 1CIUVI V/1.\nthe child is necessary to the support\nof its parents.

JjL Pulpit and 8chool a Trinity of\nInfluence That Muat Be\nUtilized fe? Building\nAgriculture.\nBy Peter Radford\nLecturer National Farmer*\'.Union\nA broad campaign of publicity on\nthe subject of rural life is needeft in this\nstate today to bring the problems\nof the farmers to the forefront. The\ncity problems are blazoned upon the\nfront puges of the metropolitan dailies\nand echoed in the country press,\nbut the troubles of the farmers are\nseldom told, except by those who\nseek to profit by the story, and the\nglitter of the package\' ofttimes obscures\nthe substance. A searching investigation\ninto the needs of the\nfarmers will reveal many Inherent defects\nIn our economic system that can\nbo easily remedied when properly understood\nand Illuminated by the pow\nor of the press.\nThe rural press, the pulpit and the\nschool are a trinity of powerful in- (\nfiueuces that the farmer must utilise\nto their fullest capacity before he can\noccupy a commanding position in public\naffairs. These gigantic agencies are\norganized in every rural community\nand only await the patronage and co\noperation of the farmers to fully develop\ntheir energy and usefulness.\nThey are local forces working for\nthe best interests of their respective\ncommunities. Their work Is to build\nand their .object is to serve. They\nprosper only through the development\nand prosperity of the community.\nEvery farmer in this state should\nsubscribe for the local paper, as well\nas farm periodicals and such other\npublications as he may find profitable,\nbut he should by all means subscribe\nfor his local paper, and. no home ,\nshould be without it. The local paper\nis Dart, of the community life and the\neditor understands the farmer\'s problems.\nIt (s the local press that will\nstudy the local problems and through\nIts columnH deal with subjects of most\nvital importance to local life of the\ncommunity.\nA Noble Task.\nIn too many instances the country\npapers mimic the city press by giving\nprominence to scandals, accidents\nand political agitation. Th? new\nrural civilization has placed upon the\nw.rural press renewed - fesponsibtlitleB,\nand enlarged possibilities for usefulness.\nIt cannot perform its mission\nto agriculture by recordiug the frailties,\nthe mishaps and inordinate ambitions\nof humanity, or by fllliug its\ncolumns with the echoes of the strug\ngles of busy streets, or by enchanting\nstories of city life which lure our\nchlldreu from the farm.\nIt has a higher and nobler task.\nToo often the pages of the city dailies\nbristle with the struggle of ambitious\nmen in their wild lust for power, nnd\nmany times the (James of personal\nconflict scar the tender buds of new\ncivilization and illuminate the pathway\nto destruction. The rurul press\nIs the governing power of public sentiment\nand must hold steadfast to\nprinciple and keep the ship of state\nin the roadstead of progress The\nrural press can best serve the interests\nof the fatmters by applying sts\nenergies to the solution of problems\naffecting tiie local community. It\nmust stem the mighty life current\nthat is moving from the farm to the\ncities, sweeping before it a thousand\nboys and eirls ner dav. It bus to rtonl\nwith the fundamental prpbloiriH of\ncivilization at their fountain head. Its\nmission is to?direct growth, teach efficiency\nand moid the intellectual life\nof the country, placing before the public\nthe daily problems of the farmers\nand giving first attention to the legislative.\nco-operative, educational and\nsocial needs of jhe agricultural classes\nwithin its respective community.\nThe Power of Advertising.\nThe influence of advertising is clearly\nvisible in the homes and habits of\ntlje farmers, and the advertising col- j\nfiams of the press are making their i\n. Imprint upon the lives of our people. |\nThe farmer iKJssesses the things that 1\nare beat advertised.\nThe farmer Is entitled to all the j\nart vftlitupf* nnrt ilnupvua ?!1\nt>r!ee of life. We need more art, rcl- ,\n| once and useful facilities on the\nfarms, and many homes and farms\nare a ell balanced in this respect, but <\nthe advertiser can\'render a service J\nby touching the advantage* of modem\nequipment throughout the columns of.\nthe rural press.\nj\nThe farmers are in need of pcraunal\nfeeds?*!;!p.

The fair to a\ncity man is an entertainment; to a\nfarmer It is education. Let us take a\nstroll through the fair grounds and\nlinger a moment at a few of the points\nof greatest Interest. We will first\nvisit the mechanical department and\nhold communion with, the world\'s\ngreatest thinkers.\nYou are now attending a congress of\nthe mental giants in mechanical science\nol all ages. They are addressing\nyoir- in tongues of iron and steel and\nin language mute and powerful tell ah\neloquent stofy of the world\'s progress.\nThe inventive geniuses are the most\nvaluable fdfm hands -We have and\nthey perform an enduring service to\nmankind. We can all help others for\na brief period while we live, but It\ntakes a master mind to tower into the\nrealm of science and light a torch of\nprogress that will illuminate the path\nv*?? ui iiviuzaiion ior iuiure generations.\nThe men who gave us the\nsickle, the binder, the cotton gin an?l\nhundreds of other valuable inventions\nwork in every field on earth and will\ncontinue their labors as long as time\n-Their bright intellects ^avtf conquered\ndeath and they will live and serve\nmankind on and on forever, without\nmoney and without price. They have\nshown ub how grand and noble it is\nto work for others; they have also\ntaught us lessons in economy and efficiency,\nhow to make one hour do the\nwork of two or more; have lengthened\nour \' lives, multiplied our\nopportunities and talffen toil off tlip\nback of humanity.\nThey are the most practical men\nthe world ever produce^ Their Inventions\nhave stood the acid test of\nutility and efficiency. Like all useful\nmen, they do not seek publicity, yet\nmillions of machines sing their praises\nfrom every harvest field on earth and\nas many plows turn the soil in mute\n\' applause of their marvelous achievements.\nFARMER RADFORD ON\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE\nThe home is the greatest contribution\nof women to the world, and the\nhearthstone is her throne. Our social\nstructure is built around her, and\nsocial righteousness is in her charge.\nHer beautiful life lights the skies of\nhope and her refinement is the charm\nof twentieth century civilization*. Her\ngraces and her power are the cumulative\nproducts of generations of\nqueenly conquest, and her crown of\nexalted womanhood is jeweled with\nthe wisdom of saintly mothers. She\nhas been a great factor in the glory\nof our country, and her noble achievementasahould\nnot be marred or her\nhallowed Influence blighted by the\ncoarser duties of citizenship American\nchivalry should never permit her\nto bear the burdens of defending and\nmaintaining government, but Should\npreserve hor unsullied fiom the allied\nInfluences of politics, and protect her\nfrom the weighty responsibilities of\nthe sordid affairs of life that will\ncrush her ideals and lower her standards.\nThe motherhood of the farm\nin our inspiration, she is the gunrdian\nof our domestic welfare nnH o nlJ.,\nto a higher life, but directing the affairs\nof government la not within woman\'s\nsphere, and political gosRip\nwould cause her to neglect the home,\nforget to mend our clothes and burn\nthe biscuits.\nRURAL SOCIAL CENTERS\nWe need social centers where our\nyoung people can be entertained,\namused and instructed under the direction\nof cultured, clean and competent\nleadership, where aesthetic\nsurroundings stir* the love for the\nbeautiful, where art charges the atmosphere\nwith inspiration and power,\nand innocent amusements instruct\nand brighten their lives.\nTo hold our young people on the\nfarm we must make farm life more\nattractive as well as the business of\nfarming more remunerative. The\nschool house should be the social unit,\nproperly equipped for nourishing and\nbuilding character, bo that the lives of\nour people can properly function\naround It and become supplied with\nthe necessary elements of human\nthought and activity.\nPATERNAL SOLICITUDE.\n"I\'m sorry I missed the football\ngame, son.

In expressing its\nsocial Interest, the modern rural\nchurch does not hesitate to claim that\nit is expressing a^true religious in*\nstlnct and^Lhe oldTln.e idea that the\nsocial in^YTncts should be starved\nwhile the spiritual nature was overfed\nwith solid theological food, is fast\ngiving way to a broader Interpretation\nof the functions of true religion.\n\\Pb take our place ]n the succession\nof those who have sought to make the\nwortt a fit habitation for the children \'\nof man when we seek to study and\nunderstand the social duty of the \'\nrural church. The true christian\nliRlon is essentially social?its, tenets .\nof faith being love and brotherhood ;\nand fellowship While following after ]\nrighteousness, the church must chal- |\nlenge and seek to reform that social\norder In which moral life is expressed.\nWhile cherishing IdcalH of\nservice, the rural church whfch attains\nthe fullest measure of success\nis that which enrichoB as many lives i\nas it can touch, and in no v;ay can 1\nthe church come in as close contact\nwith its members as through tho\navenue of social functions.\nThe country town and the rural\ncommunity need a social center. The\nchurch need cffer no apology for Its \'\nambition to f}U this need in the community,\nif an understanding of its :\nmission brings this purpose into clear\nconsciousness. The structure of a\nrurul community Is exceedingly com\nplex; it contains many social groups,\neach of which lias its own center, but |\nthere are many localities which have\nbut one church and although such\na uuurcu cannot coiumanu me interest\nof all the people. It la relieved\nfrom the embarrassment of religloasly\ndivided communities\nSocial Needs Imperative.\nThe average country boy and girl\nhave very little opportunity for real I\nenjoyment, and have, as a rule, a\nvague conception of the meaning of I\npleasure and recreation.
