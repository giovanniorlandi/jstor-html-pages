It is on these representative features that the Oakland\nSensible Six has become so popular with all classes of purchasers, whether\nthey be wealthy or of limited means.\n9\nE I\nf;i\n1 he enormous production of the Oakland factory is concentrated on one\nchasis only which enables them to market this wonderful car at the small\ncost ot $1075.00 F. O. B. factory. In considering- the purchase of a car, re\nmember that the Oakland is a six cylinder car which gives it flexibility\nand ease of operation that is lacking in cars of a less number of cylinders.\nThe Oakland Six five passenger touring car weighs 2130 pounds which\nmeans economy ip operation. A gallon of gasoline is good for from 18 to\n25 miles and a set of Standard make tires will run from 8000 to 12000 miles\nunder normal use, because the Oakland car has 32x4 tires whereas, most\ncars of similar weight are equipped with much smaller tires.\nThe cost of repairs is trifling as the construction is simple, yet substan\ntial. The Oakland has more horse power per weight than any other auto\nmobile built, except one that costs over $4,000.00\nThe touring car is roomy, there is nothing small about it. It has very easy\nriding qualities.\nIhe finish and general appearance of this car is far above other cars of a\nsimilar price.\nW. Î\nt\\\ni\nI\n3\n(\n;\nr\nk\nI\n!
