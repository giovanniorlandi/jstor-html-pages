He had dreamed\n| a long time of studying in America.\nI Why not write Burton and ask to\nbe sponsored by the Association so\nthat the immigration authorities\ncould admit him as a student? At\nthe end of his college years he\nwould return to Tanganyika to\nteach what he had learned. Burton\nand his fellow agents enthusiasti\ncally decided to enroll Kinyaou at\nAlcorn A. & M. College for four\nyears of study. It took quite a\nwhile to fill out forms and unravel\nthe red tape. Two Greenvillians,\nJudge Emmet Harty and Hodding\nCarter, met the Immigration Re\nquirements that some American\ncitizen guarantee that he would’nt\nbecome a charge of the govern\nment.\nAbout ten days ago, Kinyaou left\nTanganykia for the first time in\nhis life. He flew all the way to\nNew York, and from New York to\nGreenville, where he was met Sat\nurday by Burton. And he’s one\ndazed but happy traveler.\nAs for Tanganyika, he says that\nthe population is growing rapidly\nbecause of improved public health,\nand that consequently the people\nare eating less meat and more\ngrains and fruit. The necessity to\nget the highest possible production\nis what made him want to study\nAmerican methods. Unlike condi\ntions in the Union of South Africa,\ninterracial relations in East Africa\nare good and getting better, he\nsays, because of the British policy\nof helpfulness in attaining self\ngovernment.\nBut he’s not as interested in talk\ning about his own ocuntry as is\ngetting on with his studies here.\nThat’s what he came to America\nand Alcorn for. And if his ac\ncomplishments are as good as his\nintentions, the people of a faraway\nAfrican country may be thanking\nCharlie Burton and his fellow\ncountrymen of good intentions and\nfaith, one of these days not far ,\naway.\nAs for school, Kinyaou likes Al- \'\ncorn very well.

Howard A Leader\nOf His People\nThe need for honest, sincere, and unselfish Negro\nLeaders for the Negro people of Mississippi, long appar\nent to intelligent observers of Negro life in the state,\nhas become more evident than ever before in the history\nof the state, since the decision of the United States Su\npreme Court which declared segregation unconstitution\nal in the public schools.\nAmong those who have recently come forward for\nrecognition as a Negro leader in the state, and whose\nactivities and utterances have been given wide publicity\nsince he organized the Regional Council of Negro \'leader\nship, of which he is the permanent Chairman, is Dr. T.\nR. M. Howard, of Mound Bayou.\nIn recent weeks, especially since the widely publi\ncized meeting of Negro and White leaders with the Gov\nernor, where Dr. Howard was one of the principal spokes\nmen for immediate integration of the public schools\nin the state there has been mounting tension and a\nsharp detrioration in race relations in the state calling\nfor the deepest thinking and wisdom of leaders of both\nraces in order to preserve continious harmony and good- 1\nwill between the races while searching for a just and\nreasonable solution of the great problem posed by the\ndecision of the United States Supreme Court.\nUp at Mound Bayou last Sunday, the Regional\nCouncil of Negro Leadership met at the call of the\npermanent Chairman, for the advowed purpose and\nadopted, with his unrelenting endorsement and support,\na Statement that the organization advises Negro parents\nnot to present petitions to public school authorities ask\ning for integration until the final conclusive decision of\nr the Sport Coat with a^^\none-two punch\nstyle and value\nb,BERKRAY A\nLook at the sport coat—and then look twice\nat the price tag.

Under\nthe program, which is closely akin\nto last year’s program, the federal\ngovernment will subsidize the\ndrought-stricken livestockmen to\nthis extent:\n(1) the government will pay\none-half of the freight of hay\nshipped into Mississippi by farm\ners qualifying for drought assist\nance, with the government’s share\nnot to exceed $10/ton.\n(2) the government will pay one\ndollar per hundredweight on pur\nchases of the following grains—\ncorn, oats, barley, grain sorghums,\nor mixed foods that contain high\npercentages of those grains.\nTo be eligible for drought aid\nall applicants must be bona fide\nI farmers or stockmen whose prin\nj cipal occupation is farming or\nranching and whose financial con\ndition is such that he requires as\nsistance under this program in or\nder to maintain his foundation\nherd of livestock and continue his\nlivestock operation. “Livestock”\nin this program means cattle,\nsheep and goats only.\nThe 1955 program specifically\nrestrains speculators, food lot op\nerators or farmer-hobbyists from\nparticipation. It is aimed at those\nbona fide farmers whose livelihood\ndepends on the maintenance of his\ncustomary herd. Steers, consid\nered feed-lot animals, are not in\ncluded in the program. In Missis\nsippi the program provides for\n60-day assistance taking into ac\n! count food already cn hand on each\nfarm and that which will be har\nvested during the critical 60-day\nfeeding period. Dairymen who\nnormally buy much of their feed\nare excluded from the program.\nThe program will be adminis\ntered by the county FHA commit\ntee in cooperation with the A SC\n(formerly the PM A) offices and\ncounty agents.\nDetails of the hay program are\nnow being worked out in the gov\nernor\'s office. Details of the grain\nprogram will be explained to deal\ners and feed manufacturers at a\nspecial meeting in Jackson Sep\ntember 29.\nUnder the program all feed\nstuffs will be purchased by farm\ners at prevailing market prices.\nFarmers who have surpluses on\ntheir farms are eligible as dealers\nto other farmers providing certain\nregulations are adhered to.\nPayment for grains and hay un\nUP\nAND\nDOWN\nFARISH\nSTREET\nBy PERCY GREENE\nFARISH STREET SATURDAY\nNIGHT: Ah’m just as much as you\n:s . . . is one of the sayings heard\n’mongst Aine Haggar’s Chullin\nhat gives away one of their deep\nest yearnings and at the same\ntime tells a lot about whats-to-mat\nter with the members of the tribe\n. . . and more’n anything else folks\nfeels lack checking-up on a fellow\nsoon’s they hear him saying to\nsomebody.

Smart\ni ing after two consecutive defeats,\ni 1952 and 1953, the Braves served\nI notice when they trounced the\nhapless Grambling Tigers last\ni week, that this is their year.\nGrinding out a total of 426 yards\nto 227 for Grambling, the Braves\ndisplayed the power that has been\nmissing since 1951 when they lost\nonly two intersectional tilts. With\n269 yards rushing and 157 yards\npassing, they proved conclusively\n! that they can move the ball down\nI field and score.\nAgainst Southern the Braves\nwill doubtless find their path a\nrough one, since the Jaguar Cats\n1 possess a potent offense with Emil\nPope, quarterback. It is generally\nconceded that Pope is rated as one\n! of the best quarterbacks in Negro\nfootball. With him passing and\nrunning, the Braves chase will be:\ncut out for them in the afternoon.\nBraves fans can rest assured\nthat Dwight Fisher, head coach,\nand his staff will spend many\nhours on the practice field\nperfecting a pass defense. In the\nmeantime Southern will have to\ncontend with Alcorn’s tricky signal\ncaller, Leslie Nettles, and there is\nthe possibility that Buford Magee\nwill return to action by the week\nend. Magee has been out all sea\nson with a fractured left hand, but\nis rapidly raring to see action.\nIt all adds up to be one “whale\nof a game” for nothing would give\nthe Braves a greater pleasure than\ndefeating Southern for their first\nhome victory in their recently built\nstadium. Last year they played\ntwo home games, losing to Texas\nCollege 6-0, and tying Arkansas\nState G-6.\nBUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES\nYou can own and operate a brokerage\nbusiness of your own.\nFree working capital and a free course in\noperation for individuals interested in the\nbrokerage business who can qualify.\nFor information or appointment, call\n5-4621 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. or write,\nTHRIFT\n1426 Lynch Street Jackson, Mississippi\nt\nMAPLE STREET GRILL\nJACKSON S MOST MODERN AND BEAUTIFUL\n• Fried Chicken\n• Home Cooked\nMeals\n• Steaks - Chops\n• Sandwiches\n• Short Orders\n• Ice Cold Drinks\n“NOTHING BUT THE BEST"\nMAPLE STREET GRILL\nIN FRONT OF NEW LANIER HIGH SCHOOL\n/ ..\nr\nCharlotte...\n(Continued from Page One)\nits origin 51 years ago.\nAt the meeting of the society\nlast May, the word “white” was\nremoved from the by-laws and con\nstitution of the society by a more\nthan two-third majority vote which\n[Opened the way for Negro member\nship was in direct contradiction of\naction taken by the state medical\nsociety when meeting at Pinehurst\ndelegates beat down a proposal\nw\'hieh would open the doors to\nNegro doctors.
