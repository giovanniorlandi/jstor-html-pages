ON TIME?\nSeme Interesting Observation" Snu-\ngeated by This Frequently lie\npented Query.\n"One of the things I have learned la\nthe course of my experience," said the\nmiddle-aged man, according te the\nNew Yerk Sun, "Is that people don\'t\nlike te have you ask: \'Is your cJecit\nright?\' This is a question that we put\nte a great many people, and it is mere\nor less anuejlng te most of them. I\nhave seen men resent it with a start,\nthough tliut would be something un\nusual; but, as a rule, most mec think\nwell of their clocks, and they resent the\nquestion mere or less in their hearts if\nthey don\'t in word or manner.\n"Doesn\'t eery man think his own\nwatch is a geed timekeeper? He does.\nIt may be a cheap watch that cost ten\ndollars or -five dollars or one dollar, but\nhe thinks it\'s a geed one. All cheap\nwatches are better nowadays than they\nused te be, but each man thinks he\'s\nget the still remarkable exceptional\nwatch that really is a wonder. And\nthe clock owner thinks the same of hi\nclock. Whether it\'s in the jewelry\nstore, the bakery or the butcher\'s, they\nall resent the questien: \'Is your clock\nright?\'\n"The question implies in some ngue,\nindefinite way the idea of an assump\ntion of superiority en the part of the\nquestioner, for does it net suggest in\nferiority, at least en the ether man\'s\nclock? and no man likes it. My conclu\nsion is that nobody should ask the ques\ntion idly net nt all, in fact, unless\nsomething really depends upon it. But\nif it should be really a matter of im\nportance for you te knew, then you\nmay ask, and this time you\'ll find the\nquestion will net be resented."\nMYSTERY OF NUMERAL NINE.\nSoothsayers of Olden Times Attached\na SacrcdncM te It Seme Cart\nons Coincidence.\nAmong the magicians and sooth\nsayers of ancient times both the fig\nures nine and three had a certain\namount of mystery and sacredncss at\ntached te them, and volumes have\nbeen written in explanation of their\nmeaning in connection with the his\ntory of men and the world.

This\nbus uet always been the case, but in\nsects are becoming mere abundant and\nconsequently mere destructive. Much\nof this destruction, however, could be\neither In part or wholly prevented If\nthe proper methods of treatment were\nmade use of, and that tills is net mure\nfrequently done is ery unfortunate.\nIt U probable that the rwisei. ler the ap\nparent negligence in this regard is due\nte Ignorance as te what the Insect is In\neach particular cnte and what te de te\nprevent its ravages. It is this very un\ncertainty which results in nothing be\ning done in most cases.\nIn order te provide tills information\nfor residents of the state the entomo\nlogical division of the Iintch experi\nment station at Amherst offers its serv\nices without charge te all who may de\nsire them. In order te obtain thU as\nsistance write te the entomologist,\nIlatch experiment station, at Amherst,\nMass., describing the trouble, and. also,\nif possible, send samples of the injury\nand insect causing It, and attention will\nat once be gives te the matter.\nAs the Hatch experiment station of\nMassachusetts is supported in part by\nstate appropriation, such a use of its\nfacilities by the people of the state is\nnet only Justifiable but desirable, for\nit was established for just that purpose,\nand no eue who Incurs less by Insect\nravages can excuse himself for that less\nexcept en the ground of ignorance that\nsuch assistance could be obtained.\nSOME OVERCOAT SIGNS.\nIn\nWhich Will He Seen the Part\nThey Play Iu Oclcrmliilnir\na Miui\'n Akl\',\n"Thank you," said Senater Dever\nidge, of Indiana, te an attache at the\nwhite house who offered te assist him\nin putting en his overcoat "A young\nman never refuses te accept help In\ngetting his overcoat en, but the elder\na man gets the mero certain he Is te\nrefuse help and say: \'Ne, thank you,\nI can get it en all right.\' It is a cer\ntain indication of old age when a man\nwill net permit another te aid In get\nting en his overcoat."\nSenater Elklns overheard the remark\nof the young senator from Indiana,\nsays the Washington Star, and said:\n"Weil, if what you say is true, Senater\nIlawley is ene of the youngest men\nIn the senate. He always accepts as\nsistance in putting en his overcoat.\nBut ene day he said te me: \'Elkms,\nwhen you hear me say that I can get\nmy overcoat en without anyone help\ning me you may be sure that I am\ngetting old.\' "\nNext Jerry Smith soliloquized te\nhimself. Jerry has been at every din\nner nnd public and private reception\nnt the white house for years, and his\nprincipal business during that time\nwas te artistically aid in putting en\novercoats and Incidentally te receive\nin a Cbesterfleldi.an manner whatever\ntips were given Mm.
