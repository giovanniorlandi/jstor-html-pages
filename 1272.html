of\ntike Sixth Infantry Band bare jaM re\neet eti a letter from him from wkfoh\nate snake the following extract which\nwiNM be of muck interest to our readers\nIt wa written shortly after the bat\ntle at Meant Dajo\nZamboanga Mindanao P I\nMarch 25 ItM\nAlthough we were consider unfit\nowing to the fact that we do not get\nthe same training that the soldiers do\nfor the great work before the forces\neveryone without an exception vol\nunteered to accompany the expedition\nto Job Rote Our colonel would not\nallow us to go but agreed that we re\nmain to guard the fort PO the band\nwas detailed to do guard duty It was\nMarch 6 when the troops marched to\nthe transport with the band at the\nII\nhead of the column The scene re\nsembled a picture of a real war for\nI coukl notice the same anxious expressions\nex\nprevisions on the faces of the officers\nwives as way the case when tlie troops\nwere boarding the transports for Cuba\nIn the days of the SfMinishAmerlcan\nwar They knew full well the nature\nof the Moro and felt sure that all\nwould not return to Zamboanga alive 1\nSure enough on the morning of I\nI\nMarch 8 we received news of the bat\ntle and a partial list of the casualties\nThere was excitement in every quar\nter messengers running excitedly In\nevery direction and a score or more of\nfrantic women pacing up and down the\nverandas wringing their hands while\nthe hospital nurses were hurrying to\nthe scene of the battle I did not think\nthat it was so seriow until the morn\ning of the 12th when the gunboat\nFamiMinga arrived with fiftytwo\nwounded soldiers all of whom were\nseriously hurt The distance from i\nhere to Mount Dajo Dnho is but a\nfew hours run but from the moment\nthe fighting begun until the fort was\ntaken all communication was forbid\nden and H Htilct censorship of all co\nIriegrxms established I never saw so\nmany wounded at one time and It re\nminoed me of a few war scenes that\nI had read of But that was not half\nas bad as the next arrival of the boat\nfor then the troops came marching\nhome and when the rolls were called\nthere were eighteen brave boys lefT\nbehind to be temporarily buried on\nJob island and to be snipped home\nto America when the the regular death\ntransport made the next trip\nWe were all anxiously awaiting for\nan opportunity to talk to the wound\ned about the tight when a detail was\nordered to the hospital to assist in\ncaring for those who had been hurt in\nthe tight I volunteered to go but in\nstead of being sent to our post hospi\ntal I was hurried away with twenty\ntwo other bR nd men to Job There\nwe were divided into two squads and\nassigned to the wards where thirty\nthree of the most seriously wounded\nsoldiers had been left It not being ad\nvisable to send them to ZomboHnga\nfor treatment Among the fiftytwo\nwho had been removed the day after\nthe battle there were sixteen Filipino\nnftstllbular men The work was not\nin my line exactly but I soon began\nto make myself useful waiting on the\nsick and the day after I arrived there\nI never worked harder in all my life\nThe amputations and other operations\ntook place and my robe was saturated\nwith blood from head to foot Of\ncourse we were not expected to under\nstand the business like a trained corps\nof men but we made good with the\nmajor doctor just the same\nThe third day after we arrived there\nI obtained permission to visit the scene\nof the battle The scene was sicken\ning the corpses having been only half\nInterred in the trenches while the foul\nsmell nearly knocked me down I saw\nall I wanted to in a very few minutes\nat the foot of the mountain so decided\nto wait until the cargadores natives\nwho accompanied the squad up there\ngathered the remaining ordnance\nwhich consisted of landtackers can\nnon bolos and in fact everything in\nthe shape of arms There were near\nly M Remington rifles alone found\nIn the demolished fort According to\nGeneral Woods official report there\nwere Nt Mores slain men women and\nchildren It is due entirely to the\nbravery of the American forces that\nthe casualty li t was not greater for\nit was certain had there been a halt In\nthe gallant charge the Mores would\nhave slaughtered mercilessly\nThe band of outlaws had entrenched\nthemselves on Bud Dajo Mount Daho\non lava cone 2199 feet high about six\nI\nmile from Jolo the distance from the\nslope to the top being two miles and\nfrom whence it was their practice to\nsally forth and raid the peacefullyin\ndined Moros of the foothills Major\nScott while governor of the district of\nSulu made many efforts to bring about\na peaceful solution of the matter and\nat one time secured the promise of\nthe dattos chiefs to bring the peo\nple down from the hilltops and lead\npeaceful live These promises were\nnot kept by the chiefs however and\nthe outrages of the band grew rapidly\nlarger until finally the authorities\nwere compelled to resort to force of\narms to
