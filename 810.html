O\nIf growing Orangeville desires to\nadd to its reputation as the pro- G\ngressive commercial center of Idaho 4,\ncounty it is high time that its citi- <,\nzens were moving in the matter of\nsecuring wagon road connection\nwith the great and growing camp *\nof Thunder Mountain, in the re- •\nmote southern end of this county.\nOf course, the Frisk Prkss is not\nso unreasonable as to expect the\nbusiness men of this town to stand\nthe sole expense of this great un\ndertaking, but we believe th„t\nvery material and effective aid can\nl>e secured by representing the\nmatter to the president of the\nNorthern Pacific railroad, and\nhaving him detail oue or more of •\nhis own engineers to examine into\nthe feasibility of a northern route\nand the immense traffic which it\nwould add to the business of that\ncorporation, and more than inci\ndentally to Orangeville. The\nstate wagon road already extends\nfrom Orangeville to Warrens, or\nwithin approximately 45 miles of\nthe Thunder Mountain mines. As\nmatters stand now, the distance\nbetween Thunder Mountain and\nStiles on the north, aud Thunder\nMountain and Council on the\nsouth, is about equal, with the\ngreat advantage iu favor of the\nnorthern route that it can be\ntraveled three mouths earlier in\nthe spring and three months later\nin the fall than the route over the\nSecesh summit, by which alone\nCouncil can be reached.\nFrom Warrens into the Thunder\nMountain camp there are no great •\nengineering difficulties involved. ((\nThere is a steady ascent up to the\nhead of Warrens creek, and thence\nit descends down to the south fork G\nof Hal mon river, and then ascends O\nthat stream to the old three-fingered 4,\nSmith ranch at the mouth of Elk\ncreek.

Henry 7 Heitfeld has sent\nthe following letter which explains\nitself :\nWashington, D. C., Nov. 22 ,\n1901. Hon. H. D\'. Andrews,\nChairman Peoples\' Party State\nCommittee, Boise, Idaho:—Dear\n8 ir :\nmost thorough consideration, that\nit is both wise and patriotic to an\nnounce a change in my political\naffiliations I deem it my duty to\napprise you of this intention and\nto give yon my reasons for so\ndoing.\nWhen the People\'s Party move\nment was started in the early \'90\'s\nI realized that the chief difference\nbetween the aims and purposes of\nthe two old parties was in unrne\nmore than in principle, and that\nthere was an actual necessity, ap\npealing powerfully to patriotism\nand good citizenship, for a third\nparty as a means of checking the\ngrowth of plutocracy and preserv\ning the spirit of free government\nwith which the founders of the Re\npublic imbued our institutions.\nIt is useless for me to describe the\ngrowth and enumerate the successes\nof the People\'s Party. It iB suffi\ncient to recall the fact that in 1896\nwe elected some twenty-five mem\nbers of the lower house of Congress, j\nand that at the extra session of\n1897 the People\'s Party caucus had\na membership of eight. That this\nsuccess, eucouragiug as it was upon\nits face, was brought about only by\nalliances with other parties is\nmade manifest and significant by a\ntiare analysis of the vote. It is\npertinent in this connection to\npoint out that this result was at\ntained by au alliance in the North\nand West between Populists and\nDemocrats and in the South be\ntween the Populists and Republi\ncans. Beginning with that alli\nance the factors, sincerely devoted\nto the country\'s highest interests\nin the elements which then co\noperated, have twice fought a battle\nunder common leadership and have\nbeen welded in fact, if nbt in name,\ninto one grand organization.\nNow, Mr.chairman, I will state my\nreasons for this, to me, very im\nportant step. Wheu, in 1896, the\nDemocratic party\' met in national\nconvention a great battle was\nfought. The question was: Shall\nthe party adhere to its late policy\nof compromise and makeshift dec\nlarations or shall it once more be\ncome the party of Jefferson and\nJackson, bold in its declarations\nand fearless in its advocacy of\n\'\'Equal rights to all and special\nprivileges to none," whether it was\nto be the party for the classes or\nfor the masses?\nWe all know the outcome. y Un\nder the leadership of W. J. Bryan\nthe masses won a decided moral\nvictory. The platform adopted was\none satisfactory to both the Peo\nple\'s and Silver Republican parties.\nHowever, in November of that year\nthe battle was lost at the polls by\na very narrow margin and the gen\neral opinion was that, as a result,\nthe Democratic party would repu\ndiate its leader and its declaration.\nThis fear, and it alone, kept the\norganization of the People\'s Party\nalive.\nNext came the campaign of 1900.\nContrary to the general belief\nBryan was again named as the\nstandard bearer of his party and\nthe principles so dear to him and\nhis followers were once more made\nthe battle cry. The result was\nanother defeat at the polls, but not\nbecause the American people lacked\nfaith in Bryan or did not believe\nthe Democratic platform was the\nbetter, but because, times being\ncomparatively good, they concluded\nthat for the present it was liest to\n"let well enough alone.\nEvery observant man who fol\nlowed the last two campaigns\nclosely will concede that (heenthu\nsiasm for the democratic nominee\nwas something marvelous and that\nhis defeat cannot lie attributed to\neither lack of faith in him or his\nviews.\nConsequently, since Inith the\nDemocratic and People\'s parties\nare now striving to accomplish I he\nsame purpose, I am unable to\nwhy we should keep up separate\norganizations, since by combining\nforces in name as well as in fact we\ncan better subserve the interrets of\nthe great principles we advocate.\nOne other motive has actuated\nme to make this move, namely the\ndesire to be better able to serve my\nstate and constituency.\nThe coming session of Congress\nis universally expected to lie of tin\nusual importance. \' Questions not\nonly affecting our own state but the\nentire west will confront us. The\nIsthmian canal, the opening of\nColombia and Snake Rivers, the\nirrigation queetiou, the efforts of\ngiant syndicates to control the pub\nlic landB by leasing, and last hut\nnot least the fixed purpose of the\ntrusts and comhiues, acting through\nthe Republican organization, not\nto reenact the Chinese exclusion\nlaw, which expires in 1902, are but\na Jew of the great questions of par\nticular importance to the people of\nIdaho and the west that are to be\nconsidered and that coustraio me\nto take this step. I know that I\ncan be more useful to my [leople as\na member of a great party, admitted\nto its councils and placed by its\nagency upon important committees\nI on be if alone and with no\naffiliations.\nHaving concluded, after\nI \'\nis\nsee\nwill give this your earnest consid\neration and I believe yon will see\nthe wisdom of my resolve,\nthermore I request that you call a\nmeeting of the state committee and\nI sincerely hope when ttyey are as\nsembled these representatives will\napprove my action and with me\njoin hands with the aggressive and\ndominant element of the Demo\ncratic party, preserving it from all\nmenace of reaction within and aid\ning it to win a glorious victory for\nliberty and free government.\nŸours Very Respectfully,\n(Signed) ,Henry Heitfkld.\nOfficial Notice.\nNotice is hereby given that the\nHon.

The properties\non which work is being done are\nall showing up fine and the own\ners are developing fine bodies of\nore.\nMr. Smith says the fact that\nthe district hasabeeq given a black\neye has had the effect of weeding\nout all the wild-cat operators, and\nleaving only the conservative and\nlegitimate milling men who have\nthoroughly tested and proved the\nvalues of the mines in that section;\nthe boom fever is over, hut there is\nnow more work being done than at\nany time in the history of thecamp.\nBy next spring there will be five\nstamp mills pounding on ore from\nthe mines in that camp. None of\nthese are of very large capacity,\nbut sufficient to prove up the mines\nupon ,/hieh they are installed and\nto haudle the ore in sight. As\nthe mines are further developed\nadditional stamps will be added.\nThe properties installing stamps are\nthe Fortune. Jumbo, Wiseboy,\nCracker Jack, Big Buffalo and\nVesuvivns. The Jumbo and Ve\n-uvivus stamps have been drop\nping for some time and have\nturned out a good quantity of bul\nlion, and concentrates. Most of\nthe ore ie free milling, with some\nconcentrates. The latter will be\nhauled out to the railroad at\n■Stites for shipment to the smelter\nat Everett, Wash.\nThe Buffalo Hump syndicate\nhas removed five of the Vesuvius\nstamps to the Big Buffalo and they\nwill lie running 011 Big Buffalo ore\nby the first of the new year."
