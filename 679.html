The Journal rightly con\ncludes that the real reason is the in^\nsistence of our government on Rus\nsia\'s recognition of American pass\nports when presented by American\nJews. But while it tries hard to re\nmain neutral in its discussion of the\nmatter, here and there a statement\nis made by The Journal that cannot\nbut give encouragement and joy to\nthe many, alas too many, paid or in\nterested American defenders of the\ninfamous attitude of the Russian\ngovernment toward American Jews,\nand to the American advocates of\na renewal of our treaty relations\nwith Russia because of the prospect\nof big profits therefrom for our big\nbanking and business interests.\n"Despite the new freedoms that\nhave been granted to Jewish sub\njects of Russia since the war began,"\nsays The Journal editorial, "the\npolicy of the Czar\'s government re\nmains anti-Semitic." Thanks for the\nadmission contained in the second\nhalf of the above sentence, although\nwe are not particularly stuck on\nthat high-sounding word "anti-Sem\nitic." Russia is not anti-Sem\nitic but anti-Jewish. It is not op\npressing and crushing to death the\nold Babylonians, Assyrians, Phoeni\ncians, etc., but only the Jews. But\ngranting that anti-Semitic is the\nbetter-sounding term, and diplomat\nically more acceptable, where did our\nfriend get the information about "the\nnew freedoms that have been grant\ned to Jewish subjects of Russia?"\nThe Jews of Russia would be\'glad\nto get only one freedom, the freedom\nto live. What are the many free\ndoms they have obtained? Let us\nsee if we cannot enumerate some of\nthem: the freedom to have about\n400,000 men serve in the Russian\narmies, and to be among the first in\nthe firing line and the trenches,\namong the first to be killed or\nmaimed the freedom to have the\nRUSSIAN LOGIC VS. AMERICAN FAIR PLAY I\nI\nBy Dr. S. N. Deinard\nTHE AMERICAN JEWISH WORLD\nA Weekly Journal of Modern Jewish Life and Labors\nVOL. IV. St. Paul and Minneapolis—January 5, 191 7. No. 15\nfamilies of these Jewish soldiers\ndriven from their homes like herds\nof cattle and made to wander from\nplace to place in the severe winter\ncold, poorly clad, hungry and faint,\nold men, frail women, and 1 ittle\nchildren, the sick, the blind, the\nhalt, and to have their humble be\nlongings looted or destroyed the\nfreedom of those who remain in the\ncities of the pale to starve, to die of\nhunger or disease, because they are\nnot allowed to settle in other parts\nof the huge empire the freedoms\nsummed up in a report of the speech\ndelivered by Deputy Freedman on\nthe recent re-opening of the Duma,\nonly part of which report being al\nlowed to be published by the censor:\n"As hitherto, the Jewish press is\nsuspended and the Jews are deprived\nof the opportunity even of printing\nprayer books, text books and reference\nbooks in their own tongue. As before,\nhundreds of Jewish youth fail to ob\ntain admission to the educational in\nstitutions. I do not know whether the\ngovernment regrets that the percent\nage norm in the schools in the invaded\nprovinces was abolished not by our\ngovernment. I do know, however, that\nwhen rights were bestowed on the\nprivately maintained Psycho-Neurolo\ngical Institute the Cabinet insisted on\nthe introduction of a percentage norm.\nThe Warsaw University, when estab\nlished in that city, knew of no percent\nage norm, but the same university\nwhen transferred to Rostov maintains\na percentage norm. Jews cannot study\nat the Warsaw Veterinary Institute be\ncause it has been transferred to Novot\ncherkask, where Jews have no right\nof domicile. I do not know whether\nthe government regrets the fact that\nthere are no restrictions for Jews in\nttie present Warsaw Municipality, but\nI do know that, according to the new\nMunicipal bill of the Ministry of the\nInterior, all restrictions for Jews re\nmain intact. This is how the principle\nof right and justice is being- realized\nhere."\nW e could cite many more such\nfreedoms from recent reports. But\nwhy lengthen the tragic list? We\nwould beg the editor of The Journal\nto mention the other kind of free\ndoms that he knows of.\n"And however much we may deplore\nthe Russian treatment of the Jews, the\nlogic of the matter is all on the Rus\nsian side. No government could per\nmit itself to be dictated to in the mat\nter of whom it should allow to enter\nits realm. We ourselves are opinion\nated in racial matters. We refuse to\nI\nadmit Asiatics, and Congress in the\nimmigration bill now in conference has\nsought to make the restrictions more\nrigid.\nIt thus happens that we have put up\nthe bars against all the Mongolian sub\njects of Russia, who number doubtless\nseveral millions. It is true that few\nof these Mongolian Russians have any\ndesire to come here, but the fact re\nmains that we bar them out, and\nwould negotiate no treaty with Russia\nthat would let them in. How, then,\ncan we criticise Russia for insisting on\nher own prejudices?"\nThus our friend, The Journal,\n"The logic of the matter is all on\nthe Russian side." Russia is very\nlogical. Therefore, why refuse to\nenter into a new treaty with such\na logical country? But suppose we\nextend the argument, and apply,\nRussia\'s logic, wonderful as it is, tg\nanother situation. The Jews are not\nthe only ones who wish to travel\nin Russia. Other American newly-:\nrich indulge in that pastime. Now\'\nit is well-known that there are many\nvulgar people among these rich\nAmerican travelers who provoke a\ngreat deal of ridicule and odium\namong the more refined people of\nEuropean countries by their loud,\nshowy behavior, by their foolish ex\ntravagances, their bad manners, and\nother bad examples they set the na\ntives, in spite of the fact that the\nlatter are very glad to pocket the\nAmerican travelers\' dollars. Now\nsuppose logical Russia, convinced\nthat the example of rich American\ntravelers has a seductive, demoraliz\ning, and corrupting influence upon\nher own subjects, were to say to our\ngovernment: "We refuse to honor\nthe passports presented by your vul\ngar newly-rich, even though they be\nmulti-millionaires. We have a right\nto decide as to who should enter our\nrealm. You are doing1 the same\nthing. You exclude Africans, Mon\ngolians and others that you consider\nundesirable."\nWould not that be strictly logical?\nIt certainly would. Not a flaw in\nthe logic anywhere. Would our\ncountry then conclude a treaty with\nRussia on such terms? Logic dic\ntates that it should. But our gov\nernment, though not as logical as\nRussia, is based on the principle of\njustice and political equality to all\nour citizens, even the vulgar newly\nrich. Our government durst not\ndiscriminate against them any more\nthan against Jewish citizens, no mat\nter what Russia may think abofit it.\n(Continued on Page 307.)', "»iiniiMin^\nThe twentieth annual convention of\nthe Knights of Zion, which will be re\nmembered as one of the most successful\nmeetings of the organization, both in\nnumbers and enthusiasm, was officially\ncalled to order last Sunday morning, De\ncember 31st, at the Talmud Torah Build\ning, Minneapolis, by the president, Mr.\nMax Schulman of Chicago.\nThe convention which was arranged\nunder the auspices of the Ohavei Zion\nGate of Minneapolis, the Tikvath Zion\nGate, and the Lady Zionist Chapter of\nHadassah of St. Paul,i formally com\nmenced on Friday morning, December\n29th, when the delegates from ten states\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Knights of\nZion, and visitors from all parts of the\ncountry, began to arrive,—although many\nof the delegates did not wait for the\nformal opening, but had come earlier 4n\nthe week.\nOn Friday, the chief scene of activity\nwas the headquarters at the Gymal Dol6d\nClub, where the officers were kept busy\ntaking care of the registration of dele\ngates, and the information bureau in ad\nvising the visitors in various matters\nabout the convention doings, and of places\nof interest in the two cities.\nAt the vestry rooms of the Kenneseth\nIsrael Synagogue, on Friday evening, was\nserved a homelike Sabbath supper to\nabout fifty of the delegates by the Miz\nrachi Zionist Society, after which the del\negates adjourned to the Synagogue\nproper where they were greeted by a\nlarge gathering. The evening was de\nvoted to a series of spirited short talks\non Zionism by visiting Rabbis and other\nleaders in the Zionistic movement, the\nmeeting being presided over by Mr. H.\nSteinberg, Chairman of the National Fund\nCommittee, of Chicago, who was intro\nduced by Mr. H. Ziskin. Short talks\nwere delivered by Rabbi A. I. Cohen of\nPeoria, 111., Max Shulman and N. D. Kap\nlan of Chicago. The evening concluded\nwith a general reception to the visitors.\nThe only other meetings held Friday\nevening were held at the Adath Yeshurun\nSynagogue, Minneapolis, where Professor\nMordecai Kaplan, of the Jewish Theo\nlogical Seminary, of New York, addressed\nthe regular Friday evening gathering, and\nat the Temple Aaron in St. Paul, where\nRabbi H. Sandheim, of Winnipeg, and of\nthe University of Manitoba, spoke to a\nlarge audience.\nSaturday, business activity ceased for\nthe convention workers, and the day was\nspent by a series of lectures and address\nes, both at the morning services, and in\nthe afternoon, at practically all the Syn\nnagogues in both St. Paul and Minneap\nolis, the result of which was particularly\nto arouse the enthusiasm of the older\npeople to such an extent that new Zion\nist organizations are already being\nplanned. Dinner, served to the delegates\nSaturday noon, was arranged by Dr. N.\nN. Cohen and Mr. H. Ziskin of the Con\nvention Committee and I. J. Cohen, Rev.\nChazin, Chas. Goldberg and J. Ebin of\nthe Mizrachi. The Misses Silber and Mrs..\nN. Lowenthal helped to serve.\nThe social function of the Convention\nwas the Ball given in. honor of the dele\ngates by the Lady Zionist Chapter of Had\xad\nBY JESSE B.

This was\nthe Fraternal Delegates' Session attended\nby representatives of various organiza\ntions in the Twin Cities, at which the\ngreetings of the people of the two cities,\nand of their respective organizations,\nwere delivered to the Convention and its\ndelegates by Mr. Jonas Weil, H. Mar\ngolin, and Rev. Chazin of Minneapolis\nA. Golden and H. Segal of St. Paul. Rab\nbi C. David Matt of Minneapolis, Chair\nman of the Convention Committee, then\ndelivered to the Convention assembled\nthe greetings of the Jewish people of the\ntwo cities, bidding the visitors a hearty\nwelcome.\nThe Committee on Credentials was\nthen appointed with Dr. N. N. Cohen of\nTo the regular members of the\nZionist Convention Committee to\nthe volunteers from the various\nother organizations whose services\nwere at our disposal to the\nJewish community of the Twin\nCities whose response was so en\ncouraging, we desire to express\nour sincere appreciation.\nTHE CONVENTION COMMITTEE,\nRabbi C. David Matt, Chairman.\nMinneapolis, as chairman, with instruc\ntions to make an early report. Leon\nZolotkoff, upon behalf of the Committee\non Procedure, presented the report of\nthe committee, embodying the rules for\nthe government of the Convention. Com\nmittees on Organization, Nominations,\nResolutions, Budget and Hebrew Educa\ntion were then appointed. A committee\nof young women to conduct a raffle of a\nSilver Crown, made at the Bezalel School\nin Palestine, and valued at a hundred\ndollars, was also appointed.\nProfessor Horace Kallen of the Uni\nversity of Wisconsin and honorary vice\npresident of the organization was then\ncalled upon, and he spoke briefly, bring\ning to the Convention a message from\nJustice Louis D. Brandeis, delivered\npersonally to him only a few days before\nwhen in consultation with Justice Bran\ndeis, at Washington, asking and urging\nevery Jew to enroll in the cause of Zion\nism. Here, as at other times during the\nvarious sessions, Justice Brandeis was\naccorded an ovation, upon the mention\nof his name, which lasted for several\nminutes.\nThe President's annual report, pre\nsented at this time, by Mr. Max Schul\nman, indicated a most successful year in\nthe enlistment of new members in the\nZionist fold, the organization of many\nnew societies, and the raising of money\nfor the National Fund, and particularly\nfor the Emergency Fund. The unexpect\ned arrival during the talk of Rabbi Ste\nphen S. Wise, Chairman of the Provision\xad\nal Committee, who owing to a misunder\nstanding as to when he would arrive, ap\npeared in the Convention Hall unescorted,\nwas occasion for much applause, by all\nthose in the hall, which was filled to its\ncapacity by this time.\nThe sincerity of the reception given to\nDr. Schmarya Levin, every time he ap\npeared before the people, during the en\ntire Convention, undoubtedly marked him\nout as a true leader in Jewish life, and\nas one of the most popular Jews of this\ngeneration. Dr. Levin, not on the pro\ngram for this session, through the in\nsistence of all present, was obliged to\nspeak at this juncture. His informal talk\nrelative to the Jewish situation in Amer\nica, was considered a veritable gem and\nshowed the similarity of conditions in\nAmerica to those in Germany, and point\ning out that in this work of regeneration\nof the Jewish nation, it was the youth\nof the country who were doing the work,\nand calling upon the older people to join\nin the movement.\nAfter the renaming of the various com\nmittees, the morning session adjourned\nat one-thirty, with the singing of Hatik\nvah hy the audience.\nLuttch was then served to the delegates\nby the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Talmud\nTorah in the dining room, during the re\ncess, and again during the noon recess\non Monday. During the lunch hour\nshekel books were distributed by the\nShkolim Committee to the delegates\npresent, for sale to the Jewish communi\nties of their respective cities.\nWhen the afternoon session was called\nto order at two-thirty o'clock, it was re\nported that practically all the committees\nwere still at work in the committee\nrooms, preparing their reports.\nThe secretary thereupon proceeded to\nexpedite matters by reading a considera\nble number of messages and greetings\nfrom various individuals and organiza\ntions, among which were a letter from\nJacob de Haas, and messages from Nath\nan Straus, the Federation of American\nZionists, the Poale Zion, and the Had\ndasah organization by Miss Henrietta\nSzold.\nThe report of the Credentials Commit\ntee was presented at this point, showing\nthat one hundred fourteen delegates\nproperly registered and qualified, were\npresent at the convention, and entitled to\nparticipate in the activities on the floor\nof the convention, which attendance\nmarked the twentieth annual meeting as\none of the best attended of the organiza\ntion. The secretary then read the roll\ncall.\nThe Chairman of the Executive Com\nmittee, Leon Zolotkoff, being called upon\nby the chair, read his annual report, show\ning the detailed activity of the organiza\ntion for the past year, which emphasized\nmore strongly the president's report of\nthe success which has been meted out\nto the Zionists during the past year.\nA. B. Antanow, Chairman of the Com\nmittee on Achoozas, was then called\nupon, and presented a very interesting re\nport on the work of his committee, which\nreport was accepted.\nUnique Hebrew Session.\nThis concluded the regular business\nsessions for the day, the chair being then\nturned over to Mayer Abrams, of Chicago,\nwho presided over a session conducted\nentirely in the Hebrew language. This\nsession was arranged largely by the He\nbrew Sessions Committee, and consisted\nof speeches, recitations, and other enter\ntainment in the Hebrew language. The\nsinging of Hatikvah by a chorus of young", 'children and the address delivered by\nElijah Avin, principal of the Minneapolis\nTalmud Torah, were among the numbers.\nOther parts of the session consisted\nlargely of work done by the pupils of the\nTalmud Torah, which indicated in a pos\nitive way, that the Hebrew can again\nbe made a living language.\nSunday Evening Mass Meeting.\nSunday evening was taken up with en\nthusiastic mass meetings held in both\ncities, in St. Paul at the Masonic Temple,\nand in Minneapolis, at the Auditorium.\nBoth of these sessions were addressed by\nProfessor Horace Kallen, Rabbi Stephen\nS. Wise, Dr. Schmaryah Levin and Judge\nHugo Pam, were very well attended, and\nresulted not only in propagating the\ncause of Zionism, but in the raising of a\nsubstantial sum for the Emergency Fund,\nalthough not so large a sum as had been\nanticipated. Rabbi C. David Matt opened\nthe Minneapolis meeting and introduced\nMax Shulman as the presiding officer. Dr.\nMoses Barron introduced Leon Zolotkoff\nwho presided at the St. Paul meeting.\nThird Session Monday.\nThe third business session of the meet\ning was opened Monday morning at the\nConvention Hall with the reading of addi\ntional greetings and telegrams which had\nbeen received.\nThe report of the Illinois State League,\ngiving in detail the work of the league,\nand urging the organization of State\nleagues wherever there were sufficient\nsocieties to warrant it, for the reason that\nmore efficient work in the dating of speak\ners, and in doing other propaganda work,\ncould be accomplished by co-operation of\nsocieties within smaller contiguous terri\ntories. The report was favorably re\nceived.\nOn the program for the morning was\nthe reading of two papers, one by Dr.\nAlbert B. Yudelson, of Chicago, and the\nother by Professor Kallen, but owing to\nthe amount of business necessary to be\ntaken care of during the day, Professor\nKallen\'s talk on The Jewish Congress was\nnot reached. Dr. Yudelson, rabbi, doctor\nand instructor, closed the morning ses\nsion by the presentation of a paper on\nthe Status of Hebrew Education in Amer\nica, in which a forcible plea was made\nfor the establishment of Hebrew schools,\nwhich would give to the child a real reas\noning knowledge of the Hebrew language.\nAfter a brief noon recess, during which\ncommittee meetings were again held, the\ncommittees presented their final reports.\nREPORT RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE.\nMr. Michaels, upon behalf of the Reso\nlutions Committee, presented a report,\nrecommending the co-operation of the\nZionists with the Jewish Congress organ\nization, which has just completed its or\nganization by assimilating within its\nranks, practically all so-called classes or\ngroups of American Jews.\nThe Organization Committee then pre\nsented its report through Mr. Kaplan,\nchairman of the committee. After con\nsiderable discussion, the matter of change\nof name, which was recommended both\nby the committee and all those speaking\nin its favor, principally the young men\nof the organization, because of the name\n"Knights" conveying the idea of secrecy,\naristocracy and royalty, as opposed to\ndemocracy, and opposed principally by\nsome of the long time members of the\norganization, on the ground of the senti\nment connected with the name of twenty\nyears\' duration, was voted upon, and by\nan overwhelming name, it was determined\nthat the name of the organization shall\nJanuary 5, 1917 THE AMERICAN JEWISH WORLD 297\nhereafter be "The Federated Zionist So\ncieties of the Middle Western States."\nThe committee also recommended the\nAbolishment of all offices but president,\nvice-president, secretary, treasurer and\nchairman of the executive committee, and\nto substitute for all other offices a board\nof directors of twenty-one members, from\nwhich the chairmen of the various com\nmittees should be chosen.\nAnother recommendation was made to\nraise the per capita tax of organizations\nfrom seventy-five cents to one dollar, and\nin addition to charge the organizations\nfor shkolim for each member, this tax to\nbe payable semi-annually.\nBoth these recommendations were\nadopted.\nAnother recommendation by this com\nmittee to publish a monthly periodical of\nZionist activities within the district, was\npromptly defeated by a few forcible re\nmarks of Dr. S. N. Deinard of Minneap\nolis, who called attention to the numer\nous organs now being published, and\npleaded for their support, and opposing\nthe additional expense of another Jew\nish publication.\nDr. George Gordon reporting for the\nHebrew Education committee, recom\nmended the organization of an informa\ntion bureau, to further the establishment\nof Hebrew schools throughout the coun\ntry, and from which information could\nbe sent out to assist in the conduct of\nsuch schools, which it was urgently rec\nommended should be taught by the Ibrith\nB\'Ibrith method.\nS. Ginsburg, Chairman of the Com\nmittee on Nominations, then presented\nthe last committee report, resulting in\nthe election of the following officers\nfor the year of 1917: Max Schulman,\nChicago, president Judge Julian W.\nMack, Chicago, honorary president\nSam Greenberg, Chicago, vice-presi\ndent Horace M. Kallen, Madison, and\nRabbi C. David Matt, honorary vice-presi\ndents S. A. Hoffman, Chicago, secretary\nBernard Horwich, treasurer and Leon\nZolotkoff, Chicago, chairman of the execu\ntive committee.\nWith the election of officers, the bus\niness of the convention was formally\nconcluded, but there yet remained one\nof the most important functions of the\nseveral days\' activities, and this was the\nbanquet arranged by the Convention\nCommittee, which took place at the\nRadisson Hotel, at half past six Mon\nday evening. Over five hundred fifty\nJewish people from all over the North\nwest were seated at the banquet board\n—a fitting close for a most successful\nconvention.\nPROVISIONAL ZIONIST EMERGENCY\nFUND.\nThe total amounts pledged at the two\nmass meetings and at the banquet was\nnearly $9,000.00 of which sum about\n$4225.00 was pledged by the Out-of-town\ndelegates and visitors $3125.00 by Min\nneapolis residents and $1610.00 by St.\nPaulites. The names of the donors and\namounts pledged will be published in the\nnext issue.\nCertainly much gratification must\nhave been felt by the delegates to\nward the committee of the Ladies\' Aux\niliary of the Talmud Torah on "Eats,"\nfor in addition to the hard work of the\nconvention, the time of adjournment of\nthe morning sessions was late, and the\ndelegates surely must have eaten heart\nily, particularly in view of the tasty\nquality of the lunches served.\nCONVENTION NOTES\nThe time set for the opening of busi\nness sessions in the morning at nine\no\'clock, showed the keen insight of the\narrangements committee, for by calling\nthe sessions for such an early hour, it\nwas a simple matter to call the meetings\npromptly to order at eleven.\nWhen one of the delegates reading\ngreetings, was unable to read a num\nber of Hebrew words, and was called\nupon by others not to pass them up, his\nself possession was shown clearly in\nthe sincerity of his words, "I hope that\nsoon the time will be when a son of\nIsrael will not be so embarrassed."\nThat the seemingly impossible can be\naccomplished by perseverance and hard\nwork, is evidenced by the popularity Of\nthe "Kosher banquet" at the Radisson.\nThe idea when advanced by Rabbi Matt\nat first met with serious objection as to\ncost, and even ridicule from some of the\nmembers of the committee. It was really\ndue to the persistence and activity of the\nRabbi that the most unique and success\nful affair in the history of Jewish con\nventions was finally agreed and arranged\nfor. Orthodoxy has indeed a worthy\nchampion in this earnest leader of Mod\nern Conservative Judaism in this com\nmunity.\nWhen Rabbi Stephen S. Wise of New\nYork, chairman of the Provisional Com\nmittee for Zionist affairs, arrived during\nthe morning of the opening session at\nthe Talmud Torah Hall, the entire audi\nence arose and cheered until he took his\nseat on the platform.\nAmong the officers of the "Federated\nZionists of the Middle Western States"\nthe following Twin City men were elect\ned: Rabbi C. D. Matt, honorary vice\npresident and Drs. S. N. Deinard, Moses\nBarron, and Myron Sherper, members of\nthe executive committee.\nWe are informed that the contribu\ntion fund for the Provisional Commit\ntee is still open to those who either\nwere willing to give as much as the\nother fellow, or wanted to be seen pri\nvately.\nConvention Visitors.\nAmong the prominent business men of\nChicago who came here to attend the\nKnights of Zion convention were Mr.\nSamuel Levin, president of the Kosher\nStar Sausage Manufacturing Company,\nthe only Chicago Sausage firm manufac\nturing strictly Kosher products also Mr.\nW. Farber, president of the nationally\nknown Matzoh baking firm of Farber &\nWittenberg of Chicago.\nAmong the visitors to the Twin Cities\nfor the various conventions were Miss\nSelma Oreckowsky, guest of Mr. and Mrs.\nMax Oreckowsky, 1009 Fremont north\nthe Misses Belle and Lillian Karon,\nguests of Mr. and Mrs. D. Simon, 1623\nSummit avenue, St. Paul Miss Mamie\nWeinberg, guest of Mr. and Mrs. Leon\nSolomon of St. Paul Mr. M. Mark, Mr.\nMartin Rose and Miss Rebecca Rose, Mr.\nAbraham Mogelson Mr. S. Mendelson\nand daughter, Miss Bertha Mendelson,\nguests of Mr. and Mrs. Orenstein of St.\nPaul. All these came from Duluth. Mrs.', 'Sam Wegofsky (Lillie Segel) of Kiester,\nMinn., guest of her mother, Mrs. A. Segel\nof St. Paul Mr. Herman Arohsohn of Su\nperior, Rabbi Goldenson of Chicago,\nguest of Mr. and Mrs. I. J.

Fishman of Grand Forks.\nSIDELIGHTS ON THE CONVENTION.\nThe Jewish districts in both cities\nwere appropriately decorated with Zion\nflags and shields in blue and white, the\nnational colors, in welcome of the visit\ning delegates, indicating that the gen\neral community were aware and inter\nested in the convention and its objects.\nThe ball which the Lady Zionists ten\ndered the visiting delegates was a great\nsuccess from an artistic and social point\nof view. A great deal of credit is due\nto Miss Ethel Calmenson, the chairman\nof the ball committee, and her assist\nants whose excellent artistic tastes\nshowed themselves in the choice of the\ninvitations, the souvenir programs, and\nthe appointments of the ball room.\nThe Reception Committee, headed by\nDr. Myron Sherper of St. Paul, did\nvaliant service at the depots meeting the\ndelegates as they arrived and transport\ning them to the headquarters at the Gy\nmal Doled club rooms. Even when 35\ndelegates from Chicago arrived in a body\ntaking the St. Paulite by surprise, he did\nnot lose control of the situation but, as\nsisted by his automobile brigade, consist\ning of Mr. Ben Weissberg, Israel Kreiner\nand himself, he successfully piloted them\nto their hotels.\nWill someone volunteer to give the\nauthor of the following?

Both make\ntheir home in Chicago.\nMiss Fannie Raskas, a delegate from\nSt. Louis, did not have to be shown how\nto dispose of tickets for the benefit of the\nBezalel school of Palestine.\nAn impromptu lunch was served to\nabout fifteen delegates when they ar\nrived at the ball in St. Paul Saturday\nevening, not having eaten supper, un\nder the supposition that lunch would\nbe served there. The committee from\nChicago, however had advised the local\ncommittee, early in the course of ar\nrangements, that it was not customary\nto -serve lunch at the ball. However,\nafter having been served, we trust the\nhungry delegates were satisfied.\n298 THE AMERICAN JEWISH WORLD January 5, 1917\nTwo Noteworthy\nI Convention Eventsi\nBALL IN HONOR OF DELEGATES\nGIVEN BY LADY ZIONISTS.\nOne of the prettiest affairs ever given\nin Jewish social life in the Twin Cities,\nwas the Ball given in honor of the dele\ngates and other visitors, last Saturday\nevening, at the Masonic Temple in St.\nPaul by the Lady Zionist Chapter of\nHadassah. The guests started coming\nearly in the evening, but owing to the\ndistance that had to be traveled by some\nof the officers and delegates from their\nhotels in Minneapolis, the Promenade\nwas delayed until ten o\'clock.\nThe Ballroom was beautifully decorated\nfor the occasion with smilax, ferns and\npalms, and very appropriately with\nZionist and American flags and emblems.\nOne feature was the electrically lighted\n"Shield of David" in the center of which\nwere the letters sparkling in white and\nblue "K of Z." The same colors pre\ndominated in the lighting effects through\nout the building..\nThe promenade led by Mr. Jesse Cal\nmenson and Miss Ethel Calmenson very\nbeautifully spelled itself out into the let\nters of "K O Z 1916," receiving much ap\nplause upon its ending by those who\nlooked on.\nMusic was played during the evening\nby a string orchestra of ten pieces, un\nder the direction of Mr. Abe Pepinsky,\nthe orchestra playing from the stage\nwhich was screened with palms. A vic\ntrola concert was played in the "Lounge"\non the second floor for those not desir\ning to dance. During the entire evening,\na delicious fruit punch served in the\ncorridor, quenched the thirst of the\ndancers.\nTo the ball committee, consisting of\nthe Misses Ethel Calmenson, chairman,\nRose Peilen, Ida Goldberg, Flora Horne,\nRose Calmenson, Viola Hyman, Fannie\nKahn and Esther Zimmerman, must be\ngiven due credit for the beauty and grace\nof the affair which was attended by over\ntwo hundred couples. The Reception\nCommittee consisted of the following:\nDr. and Mrs. S. N. Mogilner, Mr. and\nMrs. Lewis Hart, Dr. Myron Sherper, Mr.\nAlex Kanter, Dr. and Mrs. Geo. Gordon,\nMr. and Mrs. Abe M. Calmenson, Rabbi\nA. H. Kahn, Dr. Moses Barron, Dr. and\nMrs. S. N. Deinard, Rabbi and Mrs. C.\nD. Matt, Dr. and Mrs. N. N. Cohen, Dr.\nThomas Ziskin, Mr and Mrs. S. D. Sloan\nand the Ball Committee.\nTHE KOSHER BANQUET.\nAnyone entering the average Jewish\nhome in the Twin Cities, at about five\no\'clock in the afternoon of New Year\'s\nday, would have found great excitement\nprevailing, for the "Children of Israel"\nattired in their holiday raiment were pre\nparing to leave their homes for some un\nexplainable reason. What was the cause\nof this great commotion among our breth\nren? Was it that a company of world\nrenowned Yiddish actors had come to\ndisplay their histrionic talents? Or was\nit the prospect of witnessing one of our\nRabbis perform a marriage ceremony?\nNeither of these possibilities was respon\nsible for the feverish excitement that\nprevailed. The \'raison d\'etre\' was a most\nunique and memorable affair in the his\xad\ntory of Twin City Jewry. For the mo\nmentous events of Convention Week were\nto be brought to a fitting climax, a grand\nfinale, with a "Kosher" banquet at that\ncitadel of "Tar fes," the Radisson Hotel\nRoof Garden—a banquet Kosher enough\nto satisfy even the ultra-orthodox, the\n"Mehadrim min Hamehadrim."\nBecause arrangements were made for\nonly 300 guests, some delay and confu\nsion was caused by the appearance of\nnearly 600 people eager to participate in\nthe feast, so that it was nearly seven\no\'clock before everybody was seated and\nthis unique and unprecedented affair be\ngan in earnest. Unique and unprece\ndented it surely was, not only in that the\nbanquet was "Kosher" and at the Hotel\nRadisson, but also in the democracy and\ntruly representative character of the\nguests. Truly, a composite picture of\nTwin City Jewry. All shades of Ortho\ndox and Reform Judaism, all degrees of\nAmericanization, all the walks of life, all\ntypes of Jews imaginable were repre\nsented in this throng. Here and there\ncould be seen venerable Jews with long\nand flowing beards wearing their skull\ncaps in accordance with the ultra-ortho\ndox custom, in striking contrast to their\nmore modern brethren attired in all the\nparaphernalia of formal evening dress\nJewesses in daring decollete, bedecked in\nthe height of fashion, also Jewesses in\nsheitels and in the more conservative\nShabbos clothes. And yet all of these\nhad gathered there for the purpose of\nsponsoring the noble cause of Zionism.\nThe banquet proper began with a ben\nediction by Rabbi Silber of Minneapolis,\nand an assurance to all that the food was\nstrictly "Kosher." After the prayer had\nended, the guests turned to the food and\nfrom the manner in which it was attacked\nit could be seen that the popularity of\n"Kosher" dishes had not yet waned. Dr.\nS. N. Deinard acted as toastmaster and\nperformed his duties in his usual happy\nvein. After the guests had had their fill\nof physical nourishment, delectable mor\nsels of spiritual food were dished out by\nthe toastmaster. The first number on\nthe program furnished a great shock to\nthe audience. Dr. Thomas Ziskin actu\nally told a story. Dr. Myron Sherper then\ntold how St. Paul had co-operated with\nMinneapolis to make this event a possi\nbility. Mr. Leon Zolotkof\'s speech was\nshort but to the point. The picturesque\nRabbi Saul Silver of Chicago then deliv\nered an inspiring appeal for the cause of\nZionism. Dr. A. Yudelson of Chicago, as\nthe next speaker, paid a glowing tribute\nto Rabbi Silber of Minneapolis for his\nefforts in making the banquet truly\n"Kosher." He also showered much praise\nupon the Minneapolis Talmud Torah. The\ntoastmaster then made a dramatic appeal\nfor funds which brought about three\nthousand dollars in pledges for the\n"Emergency Fund." After the collection\nwas over Dr. Schmaryah Levin delivered\nan eloquent address in German. He was\nfollowed by Dr. Horace N, Kallen who\ngave a scholarly presentation of the\npurposes of Zionism. The banquet closed\nat a quarter past ten with the singing\nof the "Hatikwoh" and the "Star Span\ngled Banner."\nNathan Kaplan of Chicago, formerly\npresident of Knights of Zion, in passing\none of the local kosher restaurants in\ncompany with Dr. Kallen, refused to en\nter until Dr. Kallen had first passed on\nthe degree of Kashruth of the place.', 'It is a long time since the Jew\nish communities of the Twin\nQities have had such enthusiasm\nin so continuous and concentrated\na form as in the last week or so.\nWith the Menorah as the preface\nand Zionism as a conclusion, the\nweek was indeed a round of in\ntellectual pleasure.\nThose who attended the various\nfunctions of the Menorah conven\ntions (from the dance to the sym\nposium) could not heip feeling\nthat the best element, the most prom\nising element in Jewish life was un\nfolded before their very eyes, and that\nthe assurance of leadership would be\nfulfilled.\nLeadership among the Jews as\namong other groups requires en\nthusiasm, earnestness and depth.\nEnthusiasm, the Menorah showed\naplenty earnestness was perhaps\nmore evident than anything else\ndepth, evidenced by Jewish life\nand Jewish ideals, was more evi\ndent as the sessions progressed.\nThe interest shown by the com\nmunity as well as by the students\n,in the symposium, indicated the\nwillingness of our young people\nto become acquainted with the\ncontent of Judaism.\nWith the proper leaders to\nguide this phase of student activ\nity with strong enough desire to\ngain knowledge at first hand\nwith sympathy for and interest in\nthe masses whom the students\nare ultimately to lead, the Meno\nrah movement is a most promising\nphenomenon in Jewish life in\nAmerica.\nNo sooner was the Menorah\nconvention over than the Zionistic\nconvention was in full swing. If\nthe Menorah represents the stu\ndent activity in Jewish life, then\nZionism may be said to be the grad\nuate activity, for the latter repre\nsents those who have already at\ntained in some measure to leader\nship. That there is no real conflict\nbetween Menorah and Zionism is\nproved by the synthesis of the two as\nout-lined by Professor Kaplan on Fri\nday evening at the Adath Yeshurun\nwhich was as splendid an address as\nany made during the entire week.\nThis being the first time a con\nvention of such magnitude was\never held in the Northwest, there\ni naturally was an unusual aggrega\ntion of speakers of great dynamic\nforce. Not the least interesting\nthing was the fact that there were\nalmost as many presentations of\nJanuary 5, 1917 THE AMERICAN JEWISH WORLD\nIMPRESSIONS OF THE ZIONIST\nCONVENTION\nBy Rabbi C. David Matt.\nZionism as there were speakers.\nThere was the highly intellectual\n"brand" as represented by Professor\nKallen the forceful and dramatic\ntreatment of Wise the deeply stim\nulating and suggestive originality of\nLevin, not to mention the striking\npresentation by Pam and the logical\naddress of ZolotkofF. To have heard\nany of these would have been a\ntreat to have heard them all was a\nfeast.\nAs to the convention itself, one\'s\nsatisfaction with it depended on\nwhat one expected of it. If you ex\npected a group of delegates, each of\nwhom would have an inspired per-\nw\n•7\nRABBI C. DAVID MATT\nsonality, you were aiming too high.\nIf you expected a collection of\n"Lodge Politicians" you were aiming\ntoo low. If you expected a group\nof men, some eminent in various\nlines in their communities but most\nof them sincere and enthusiastic in\nrealizing their ideals, then the con\nvention could have come up to your\nexpectations.\nThe sessions were orderly without\nbeing dead or routine. The discus\nsions were spirited enough to make\nthem interesting. There were sev\neral striking incidents, as for in\nstance when Doctor Levin (on Sun\nday morning) in his informal talk,\ndelivered probably the best speech of\nthe entire convention. Another in\ncident was the attempt on the part\nof the old guard to retain the name\n"Knights of Zion," in the face of the\nargument by the "Youngsters" that\nthe name was as misleading as it was\nout-worn. There was also the ele\nment of humor when a delegate who\npleaded that in so earnest a movement\n299\nlike Zionism, the delegates should re\nfrain from applause, was himself ap\nplauded at the conclusion of his re\nmarks.\nThe various functions of the con\nvention were satisfying. The dance\nat the Masonic Temple in St. Paul\nwas as tastefully arranged as it was\nenjoyable, though like all convention\ndances that precede the actual ses\nsions, it probably was responsible\nfor the late opening of the first ses\nsion. Such a dance it seems to me\nshould either be eliminated from a\nconvention program or should come\nat a different stage of the proceed\nings.\nThe mass meetings were some\nwhat disappointing in several re\ngards. It is unfortunate that the\nspeakers had so little time to do\nthemselves or the audience justice.\nThe speeches were "Railroaded" in\nmore senses than one. As to the\nappeal for funds, while necessary, it\nwas undoubtedly an evil. Many of\nthe Zionists, certainly the members\nof the committee were anxious that\nfor once a Zionist mass meeting\ncould be arranged where not only\nadmission should be free but where\nthe audience would not have to "pay\nto get out." The excitement of the\nappeal and the time it took for the\naudience to regain its composure\nmade it especially trying for the\nlast speakers who spoke late in the\nevening as it was.\nThe banquet was very enjoyable\nand successful, too much so in fact.\nHad the initial arrangements for a\nbanquet of three hundred and fifty\nbeen strictly adhered to, the banquet\ncould have been more like a social\ngathering have given more time to\nthe speakers and made at least a\nthousand dollars more for the emer\ngency fund. As it was, the banquet\nwas probably the most successful\nfunction of the convention and this\nshould be a symbol to the Zionists\nthat almost anything can be accom\nplished if there is the desire, for\neven at the Radisson a strictly kosh\ner banquet could be served.\nIn short the convention as a\nwhole was highly successful, only in\ndetails did it fall down. It was felt\nthat had the committee been better\norganized, had there been more\nworkers available, and had the com\nmittee been more experienced, the\narrangements for the conventions of\nthe Knights of Zion would have been\nflawless. (But then, should we hope\nfor perfection even in Zionism at\nthis stage?)\nAs for the community at large,\nthere is no doubt that many Jews\nrealize perhaps for the first time\nthat they are much more Zionistical\nly inclined than they themselves had\nsuspected.

The Jewish com\nmunities of the Twin Cities feel grat\nified to have had the privilege of act\ning as its hosts. It was a genuine\npleasure to meet our comrades in\narms. The amount of sentiment fav\norable to Zionism which the presence\nof the convention has stirred up in\nthe Twin Cities was a revelation. We\nnever realized that there were so\nmany potential Zionists among us.\nThe amounts raised for the Emer\ngency Fund are a credit to our friends\nand sympathizers.\nWe have all along felt that there\nis a great deal of latent Zionist senti\nment in our midst, as well as in every\nJewish community. How can it be\notherwise? Most Jews are still loyal\nand devoted to Jews and Judaism.\nThey wish to see our people and our\nfaith preserved. The indifferent or\nnegative Jews, Jews who are such\nonly by name, or because they can\nnot help themselves, and who would,\nif they could, escape from their Jew\nishness and make the world forget it,\nare comparatively speaking few in\nnumber. The loyal Jews who are in\ndifferent or opposed to Zionism are\nso because of certain preconceived no\ntions, certain illusions and delusions,\nor simply because they do not know\nor understand the movement and its\nideal. Once the matter is properly\npresented and explained, and its in\nevitable necessity made clear and its\nreasonableness made manifest to them\nthey are easily won for the cause.\nThe reason why it has not more\nadherents, especially among the Amer\nicanized Jews, is that we have not\n300 THE AMERICAN JEWISH WORLL January 5r 1917\nenough workers, propagandists and\nfield. When weorganizers in the\nconsider how every cause that is dear\nto our Christian neighbors is pro\nmoted by large numbers of paid work\ners who devote all their time and en\nergy to its interests, paid propagan\ndists, organizers and field secretaries,\nwe can readily see how Zionism must\nsuffer because of our neglect of this\nmethod. If the Knights of Zion,\nwhich comprises twelve Middle-West\nern states would have half a dozen\npaid field secretaries in its territory\nand the Federation of American\nZionists about twenty-five or thirty\nmore to" cover the remaining sections\nof the United States, the movement\nwould grow by leaps (and bounds.\nThere are plenty of men in the Zion\nist ranks well qualified for such work.\nIn the meantime let us record one\nexcellent move made by the conven\ntion in the Twin Cities, namely, the\nchange of the organization\'s name,\nfrom "Knights" of Zion, a name that\nhas always been objectionable to us\nfor several reasons, to the "Federated\nZionists of the Middle Western\nStates." With this change of name\nlet us hope there will now come re\nnewed and increased prosperity and\nprogress for the organization.\nAs far as our local Zionists are\nconcerned, let us once more remind\nthem that the progress of Zionism in\nthe Twin Cities, like the prog^ss of\nevery society and institution, de\npends upon the undivided attention\nand unflagging interest and zeal of\nthe officers in charge of the work.\nWhen the Zionists will succeed in\nelecting as officers of their societies\nmen and women who will devote all\nthe energy and time they can spare\nfrom their regular bread-winning\npursuits to the cause of Zionism, leav\ning other communal interests to other\nworkers, the societies will become in\nfused with new life, and will advance\nfrom strength to strength. It would\nbe a pity if the enthusiasm for Zion\nism aroused in our midst by the con\nvention should be allowed to evapo\nrate without having accomplished per\nmanent good results.\nNATIONALISM AND PLAIN\nJEWISHNESS.\nIf Nahum Sokolow really denounc\ned, as he is quoted in The American\nIsraelite, "as national meshummodim\nthose who do not believe that Zionism\nis a panacea for all the ills that af\nflict Jewry" he simply showed hi.riself\nthe same kind of a fool that many\nanother widely heralded nationalist\npropagandist is, who can see no-merit\nin any other kind of Jewishness, and\nsneers at every kind, except national\nism.

We Jews are still\nidol worshippers. We make idols of\nmen, and modern Jewish nationalism\nhas produced more idols than any\nother movement. Anybody of any\ndistinction and with a glib tongue and\nsome cute affectation, is immediately\nheralded as a sage and prophet, a ver\nitable oracle. It would almost seem\nto be an indication of our intellectual\npoverty, and since our sages and ora\ncles must always be paraded before\nthe public, and must always be talk-\'\ning to knowledge-thirsty gatherings,\nfloods of nonsense are poured forth\nthat rival a Alississippi inundation.\nHence some of the queer, freakish\nstatements of some of our nationalist\norators hence their exaggerations,\ndistortions, and contortions, their mis\nstatements and perversions.\nNo other kind of Jews exists any\nmore except the nationalist. No other\nsentiment, loyalty, ideal, are worth\nwhile except nationalism. The relig\nious sentiment is pooh-poohed. Or\nthodoxy is sneered at reform is\nsneered at. Hearing them talk one\nwould infer that Zionism was utterly\nincompatible with Judaism, orthodox\nor reform. Among the pioneers in\nZionism we have had such men as\nRabbis Reines and Samuel Mohiliwer,\npillars of Russian orthodoxy, and\nRabbis Felsenthal and Gottheil, lead\ners in the Reform synagog, all scholar\nly men, and clear thinkers. They did\nnot find their respective types of Juda\nism irreconcilable with nationalism,\nnor did they negate the Jewishness\nof those members of their communi\nties who were not Zionists. This\nsneering at the synagog be it orthodox\nor reform, will not help the national\nist cause. Rabbis, even though they\nrepresent the Reform synagog, may be\njust as consistent Zionists, and may\nknow more about Zionism, Jews and\nJudaism, than some of our nationalist\npropagandists who see no reason for\nthe existence of any kind of synagog.\nWere it not for the synagog and its\nallied institutions, our brilliant nation-', 'Oscar S.

O. B. B. last Thurs\nday evening, evidently attracted by the\npromised discussion of Zionism. Neither\nwere they disappointed. Dr. Myron\nSherper of St. Paul started things by de\nlivering a talk for Zionism at the close\nof which he called for questions. An open\nforum discussion followed in which the\nnegative was supported by Gustavus\nLoevinger of St. Paul, Hiram D. Frankel\nalso of St. Paul, and Mr. Bloom, formerly\nof Des Moines, now a resident of Minne\napolis. The affirmative was upheld by\nDr. S. N. Deinard, Dr. Geo. J. Gordon and\nRabbi C. David Matt. A very lively and\nilluminating discussion took place at\ntimes becoming very heated in tone.\nThose present were so interested that\nwhen the meeting adjourned at twelve\no\'clock, it was decided to continue the\ndiscussion at the next monthly meeting,\nand perhaps at further meeting.\nThe official business of the meeting con\nsisted in the installation of the newly\nelected officers by Mr. Hiram D.
