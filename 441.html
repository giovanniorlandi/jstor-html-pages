The data\ngenerated through the questionnaire was analyzed using descriptive statistics and t-tests. Results show that face-to-face interactive\nmodel was not only the most frequently used, but also the most widely adopted in doctoral thesis supervision while ICT-based\nmodels were rarely used. Students supervised under face-to-face interactive model reported being more satisfied with dissertation\nsupervision than those operating under face-to-face noninteractive model. However, students supervised under these two models\ndid not differ significantly in their perceived development in research-related skills.\n1. Introduction\nThere has been an increase in the demand for doctoral\neducation in Nigeria. This demand is exacerbated by the\nNational Universities Commission and universities’ stipulation\nthat Ph.D. is the minimum qualification for teaching in\nUniversities and the ultimatum to those already in the system\nto acquire the Ph.D. Further, the high rate of unemployment\nhas contributed largely to this rise. Nevertheless, this increase\nshould be a good development for rapidly increasing the\nquality of education outcome for effective manpower for the\nnation’s development. However, reports of low completion\nrate as well as poor quality of doctoral dissertation indicate\nthat these ideals might be far from being attained.\nAccording to Scott et al. [1, page 149], doctoral programme\nis “gold standard” for research study, representing\nexcellence and attracting both resources and prestige”. As\nsuch, it is expected that its recipients exhibit high levels\nof proficiency both in research and in disciplinary studies.\nThese highlight the place of doctoral research/dissertation\nas high point of the doctoral programme. Indeed, Bako [2]\nestablished a link between the poor quality of research in\nthe Nigerian universities and the poor doctoral dissertation.\nAligning with this position, Henson et al. [3, page 229] argue\nthat “the nature and quality of research is inseparable from\nthe nature and quality of the graduate education and of future\neducation researchers.” While they made specific reference\nto educational research, their argument is obviously validly\nextended to other disciplines.\nIssues surrounding the quality of doctoral research and\nadvisement/supervision have therefore attracted the attention\nof many scholars [3–9]. Specifically, students’ levels of\nsatisfaction with their supervisory experiences vary and the\nquality of supervision offered has also been questioned ([10,\n11] cited in [12, 13]). The discourse on doctoral supervision\nhas also highlighted that doctoral supervisors play a critical\nrole in doctoral education, and doctoral supervision is crucial\nto successful research education programmes ([14] cited\nin [15–17]). Further specifying the roles which dissertation\nsupervisors must play to achieve this success in doctoral\nprogramme, Mainhard et al. [18, page 360] noted that they\n“must provide the time, expertise, and support to foster the\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nEducation Research International\nVolume 2014, Article ID 790750, 9 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/790750\n', '2 Education Research International\ncandidate’s research skills and attitudes and to ensure the\nproduction of a thesis of acceptable standard.”\nIn Nigeria, concerns have been expressed at various\nquarters on the poor quality of doctoral dissertation. Poor\nquality of dissertation points to the deficiency in students’\nresearch skills. This deficiency has often been traced to the\nquality of research training the students receive. Indeed, poor\ndissertation supervision as a form of research training shares\nthe major blame for poor quality of dissertation produced by\ndoctoral students. Hence, a call was made by the National\nUniversities Commission (NUC) to Vice Chancellors to turn\nmore attention to dissertation supervision [2].\nBeyond being a local concern, doctoral supervision has\nbeen a global issue. For instance, in the USA, the “Carnegie\nInitiative on the Doctorate” (2001–5), led by the Carnegie\nFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching, identified\nsupervisors as pivotal to any effort to improve doctoral\neducation [19]. Furthermore, as part of Europe’s Bologna\nProcess, the “crucial role of supervision” was recognized in\na ministerial agreement on the “Ten Salzburg Principles on\nthe Doctorate,” and, at the inaugural meeting of the European\nUniversity Association Council for Doctoral Education, one\nof the five themes for doctoral training in Europe was\nidentified as “improving the supervision of PhD candidates,\nparticularly through better training andmonitoring of supervisors”\n[15, page 80]. However, while developed countries\nhave gone far in initiating policies and programmes in this\narea, evidence convinces one of the contrary at the local\narena. In Nigeria, the quality of postgraduate programme as\na policy issue only gained the attention of the NUC recently\nwith the launching of the first Standards for Postgraduate\nProgramme for Nigerian Universities, on December 5, 2011\n[20].\nIt is obvious that the grave concerns on the quality of\npostgraduate research [2, 21, 22] have received neither requisite\npolicy nor scholarly attention considering its relevance\nfor ensuring quality in university research in particular and\nuniversity education in general. This work intends to expose\nthe various dissertation supervision models prevalent in a\nfederal university in Nigeria and to evaluate these models in\nterms of doctoral students’ satisfaction and development in\nresearch-related skills.\n2. Dissertation Supervision Models\nThe completion of doctoral dissertation is the high point of\nthe entire doctoral programme. In fact, it is the capstone of\ndoctoral programme. It is not surprising then that research\nsupervision, the vital component of the process through\nwhich students reach this capstone event, has attracted\nvolumes of research interest. Although a number of scholars\n(See e.g.; [23]), have proposed and reported the practice\nof team and collaborative research supervision models, our\nunderstanding of doctoral dissertation supervision presented\nin this work is drawn from the definition of postgraduate\nsupervision proffered by Lategan [24, page 4] who sees it\n“as the active engagement of a supervisor in assisting the\npostgraduate student in identifying a line of inquiry, delineating\nthe scope of a project within that line of inquiry, and\nproviding guidance for successful completion of the project\nand the dissemination of results.” This active engagement\ninvolves continuous interaction and dialogue between the\nstudent (the supervisee) and the supervisor based on the text\nof the dissertation.\nRecognizing this, Wang and Li [25] posit that, in doctoral\nresearch, feedback from supervisor plays an important role\nin assisting student’s development throughout the academic\nresearch journey. The student benefits from engaging in\nintellectual exchanges with the supervisor in order to receive\nguidance on their research progress and thesis writing. It is\nthrough the feedback process that the supervisor helps the\nstudent go through the research journey towards becoming\nan independent researcher and a competent scholarly writer.\nThese conceptions presuppose a one-on-one relationship\nbetween two persons—the supervisor and the supervisee.\nThus we operate with the framework of the traditional dyadic\nrelationship between a supervisor and his/her supervisee.\nTherefore other supervision models based on groups of three\nor more are beyond the scope of this paper.\nHow the entire process of supervision is enacted is\nrelevant also to students’ satisfaction with the programme,\ncompletion of the programme, and the quality of work that\nemerges. In line with this, many scholars proffer a number of\nsupervision models/styles as means of enhancing the quality\nof research supervision and success of doctoral programme\n[26].\nSupervision models have had long tradition in psychology,\nguidance and counseling, and education, yet there is no\nclear definition of what a supervision model is. A number of\nscholars who have been concernedwith research supervision,\nfor instance, Gurr [27] and Manathunga [23], discussed\nresearch supervision models but did not also proffer a\nconceptual clarification. Gurr, on his part, used both model\nand style interchangeably. Drawing from literature in this\nfield, we see research supervision models as forms in which\nresearch supervision takes emerging from attitudes, roles,\nand nature of interaction pattern exhibited by supervisorsupervisee\nduring the supervision process.\nA number of these models have been examined over the\nyears. Building on the work of Blumberg [28] and Anderson\n[29] who highlighted “active” and “passive supervisory”\nstyles, Gurr [27, page 86] developed a model of research\nsupervision which he called supervisor/student alignment\nmodel. He theorized that graduate supervision is a means of\ndeveloping the students to become competently autonomous\nscholars through the alignment of the students’ needs at each\nstage of the thesis development to the supervisors’ supervisory\nstyles through communication anddialogue between the\ntwo. This entails a movement between two proposed styles—\n“hand-on” or “hands-off”—as may be determined by the\nneeds of the student at the different stages of his or her work.\nThe relevance of this model lies in promoting discussions and\ndialogue between the supervisor and the supervisee.\nDysthe [30], from her analysis of the responses of students\nand professors (supervisors), interviewed on research\nsupervision experiences and developed three models of\nresearch supervision—teaching, partnership, and apprenticeship\nmodels. The teaching model is based on the traditional\n', 'Education Research International 3\nteacher-student relationship. It builds on asymmetrical power\nrelationswhere the supervisor gives corrections to the student\nand controls and directs the student’s work. The apprenticeship\nmodel involves the supervisee observing and copying\nthe supervisor’s actions. Here, the student learns research\nby engaging in the actual practice of research under the\nsupervisor. In the apprenticeship model of supervision, the\nstudent may adopt a position of passivity and the supervisor\ndirects the relationship. In this model, feedback is accepted\nin an uncritical way, with the students importing suggestions\ninto the text and placing more confidence in the words of\nthe “master” than in their own ability to formulate acceptable\ntexts ([31], cited in [32]).\nThe partnership model is based on more symmetrical\nrelationship built on dialogue as the central strategy. As\nobserved by Dysthe [30, page 522] “most students equate\ndialogue with good supervision” and seem to be more\ncomfortable with this model of supervision. The partnership\nmodel proposed by Dysthe is akin to the peer-to-peer model\ndescribed by Wang and Li [25] where the supervisor regards\nthe student as a practicing academic and as a colleague. The\nfeedback is thus provided in the mentoring model depicted\nby the supervisor and student engaging in open dialogic\nexchange of insights and ideas.\nThemodels developed byDysthe and other scholars seem\nto be built around face-to-face forms of interaction around\ntexts. Although the face-to-face mode of relationship seems\nto give both the supervisor and the supervisee the affordances\nof clarifying understandings and expectations and negotiating\nmeanings [31, 33], research evidence shows that the\ntraditional face-to-face models can be supplemented with\nnew technologies. The affordances of these new information\nand communication technologies (ICT) and realities of heavy\nworkload of supervisors have opened yet another window to\nwhat is viewed as the ICT-related dissertation supervision\nmodel. One of such mixed models reported by de Beer\nand Mason [34] is the blended learning model. In blended\nlearning (BL) research supervision, the role of the supervisor\nis that of indicating the main sources of information to be\naccessed by the student in face-to-face consultations and\nvia the Internet and libraries and then evaluating what the\nstudent has gained from it. This model is believed to have\nimproved the supervision process, reduced administrative\nworkload of the supervisor, and created a dynamic record\nof the supervision process. Students’ evaluation of the innovation\nshows that it has some limitations which included\ninability to read body language cues and facial expressions as\nin face-to-face and being also seen to present communication\nin an abrupt manner. Consequently, emphasis on face-toface\ncontact early in the supervision process is necessary in\norder to build rapport, trust, and understanding between\nthe supervisor and student. However, one of the limitations\nof this approach which may not be an issue in the context\nof the above research but could be in the Nigerian context\nis accessibility to ICT facilities. Statistics provided by the\nNational Bureau of Statistics shows that very few have access\nto various ICT facilities in Nigeria [35]. However, from 2004\nto 2008, this case university had a mandatory programme\nfor the provision of ICT facilities, such as ICT Centres (the\nAfriHUB), which provides ICT training and internet services\nto both students and lecturers. This was followed by the\nprovision of laptops and free internet access to all lecturers.\nIt is expected that both lecturers and students have grown in\nthe culture of using these ICT facilities for various forms of\neducational activities.\nA number of things stand out in the analysis of the\nvarious dissertation supervision models reviewed. These are\nthe degree of interaction and dialogue between the supervisor\nand the supervisee on the one hand and the mode of this\ninteraction (face-to-face or technology mediated) on the\nother. Furthermore, none of these models have been quantitatively\nevaluated by the students who are major players in\nthe whole process of dissertation supervision. In line with\nthis, we propose four models of dissertation supervision as\nfollows: the face-to-face interactive model, the face-to-face\nnoninteractive model, the ICT-based interactive model and\nthe ICT-based noninteractive model. In this work, student\nand supervisee are used interchangeably.\n3. Doctoral Students Satisfaction with and\nEvaluation of Dissertation Supervision\nIt is an age-old practice to elicit information from consumers\non their satisfaction with services received. Increasingly,\ninstitutions of higher education in the developed countries\nhave recognized their students as primary consumers. Hence\nthe institutions consider the satisfaction of the students’\nneeds vital to their existence. Student satisfaction refers to\nthe favourableness of a student’s subjective evaluation of the\nvarious outcomes and experiences associated with education\n[36, 37]. Student satisfaction with dissertation supervision is\ntherefore seen as a student’s subjective favourable evaluation\nof the interaction and encounter with the supervisor during\nthe dissertation writing process.\nIt is believed that the assessment of students’ satisfaction\nwith educational services has positive outcome for both students\nand the institution. It increases the chances of students’\ncompletion of their programme, their self-motivation, and\ntheir success in the programme. On the other hand, the\ninstitution would be more prepared to deliver services that\nwould meet students’ needs and improve the services and\nthe chances of the students coming back for further studies\nas well as the students’ positive recommendation of the\ninstitution to others [37].\nFollowing this line of reasoning, such practice as student\nevaluation of teaching (SET) was introduced in most developed\ncountries. The volume of research drawing attention to\nits relevance [38, 39] and those questioning the reliability and\nrelevance of the practice [40–43] show how controversial it\nhas become. However, evaluation of dissertation supervision\nwhich is a major aspect of research training has not received\nmuch empirical investigation.This lack observed byMarsh et\nal. [44] was reechoed by Mainhard et al. [18, page 360] who\nnoted that “in many institutions it is not common to evaluate\nsupervisory experience. . ..”\nHowever, a very significant contribution to the evaluation\nof research supervision model is the work of Gurr [27, page\n', '4 Education Research International\n88] in Sidney. He did a trial testing of the “student/supervisor\nalignment model” as a supervisory tool with four of his doctoral\nstudents. He noted that the model enhanced student’s\nresearch ability which he described as “competent autonomy”\nsuch that one of the participant’s papers won that year’s best\nstudent paper and subsequently the participant produced\n“three refereed papers.” Apart from these observable indicators\nof the effectiveness of this model, he further sought\nfeedback from the students on the relevance of the model, to\nwhich most of the students commented that they found the\nmodel useful. Although Gurr’s study was a trial of a model’s\neffectiveness using case study approach, the use of very few\nstudents from a single department and emphasis on a single\nmodel are some of its limitations.\nThis work therefore extends this field of research by\nexamining dissertation supervision models in use, doctoral\nstudents’ satisfaction with supervision experience, and contribution\nof these models to development of research-related\nskills using a larger sample of doctoral students from diverse\ndisciplines. The following research questions guided this\nstudy.\nResearch Questions\n(1) What are the dominant research supervision models\nused in doctoral dissertation supervision?\n(2) How do doctoral students involved in the different\nsupervision models compare in terms of satisfaction\nwith dissertation supervision?\n(3) How do doctoral students involved in the different\nsupervisionmodels compare in their evaluation of the\ncontribution of dissertation supervision to development\nof research-related skills?\nHypotheses\n(1) Doctoral students under different models of dissertation\nsupervision will differ significantly in their self-\nreport of satisfaction with dissertation supervision.\n(2) Doctoral students under different models of dissertationmodels\nwill differ significantly in their self-report\nof acquisition of research-related skills.\nContext of the Study.The empirical site is a federal university\nin South-Eastern part of Nigeria. It enrolls quite a high\nnumber of doctoral students. The student population is\npredominantly Igbo.However, the official language inNigeria\nis English Language. Between 2004/2005 and 2010/2011, the\nuniversity enrolled about 1339 doctoral students. Doctoral\ncandidates must have 3.5 (at 5 point scale) in the degree of\nmaster to qualify for admission. On admission, students are\nassigned dissertation supervisors.Theminimumduration for\nthe programme is 24 months for full-time and 36 months\nfor part-time students while the maximum duration is 60\nmonths and 72 months for full-time and part-time students\nrespectively. Students are expected to take a minimum of\n9 and maximum of 12 unit courses. The dissertation writing\nis a very significant part of the programme. Students\nchoose dissertation topics after the course work. They are\nexpected to go through three stages of dissertation oral\npresentation (department, faculty, and external) before the\ndegree is awarded.The first stage, called the proposal defence\nwhich comes up when the student completes three chapters\n(introduction, literature review, and methods), the faculty\ndefence when the five chapters are completed, and then the\nexternal which marks the end of the programme and the\naward of the degree.The university lecturers have a very high\nworkload as some lecturers supervise as much as 20 doctoral\nstudents as against the minimum of five stipulated in the\npostgraduate regulations. This is coupled with the demands\nof master’s and undergraduate programmes. There is also a\nhigh level of low completion rate: less than 10%of the doctoral\nstudents graduate within due date.\n4. Methods\nThe study is a descriptive survey.The sample was 310 doctoral\nstudents drawn through simple random sampling from the\nlist of 1,260 doctoral students registered between 2005/2006\nand 2009/2010 academic sessions. Of the 310, 228 returned\ntheir questionnaire which represents 74% return rate. This\nnumber consisted of 104 males (45.6%) and 124 females\n(54.4%) who have been in the programme for a minimum\nof 1 year and a maximum of 5 years. While 84 (36.8%)\nwere on full-time programme, 144 (63.2%) were on parttime.\nMost of the participants 158 (68%) were at the proposal\npreparation stage of their dissertation, 64 (28%) were still at\ntopic selection stage while quite a few, 8 (3.5%) respondents\nwere waiting for their external/final defence.The distribution\nof sample according to faculties were as follows; education\n71 (31%); social sciences 46 (20%); management sciences 52\n(23%), arts 21 (9%), and environmental sciences 39 (17%).\nThe instrument used for data collection was a 32-item\nquestionnaire. Six items from the instrument elicited demographic\nand programme information from the students. Of\nthe 26 questions that addressed the research aims, 15 were\ndescriptors of different models of dissertation supervision\nto which students responded on a five-point Likert-type\nscale which consisted of almost always (5), frequently (4),\nsometimes (3), rarely, (2) and almost never (1). The items\nwere distributed as follows; face-to-face interactive model—\nsix items; face-to-face noninteractivemodel—five items; ICTbased\ninteractivemodel—two items and ICT-based noninter-\nactive model—two items. Students’ satisfaction with dissertation\nsupervision and development of research-related skill\nwere measured by two subscales (supervision and skill development)\nof Postgraduate Research Experience Questionnaire\n(PREQ) adapted from previous study by Australian Council\nfor Educational Research as reported by Ainley [10]. The\nsatisfaction with supervision had six (6) questions based on\na five-point Likert-type scale: very satisfied (5); satisfied (4),\nneither satisfied or dissatisfied (3); dissatisfied (2); and very\ndissatisfied (1). The contribution of dissertation supervision\nto doctoral students’ development of research-related skills\nwas measured using five (5) items that made up the skill\ndevelopment subscale of PREQ. The response format was\n', 'Education Research International 5\nTable 1: Questionnaire items’ mean and standard deviation scores.\n𝑁 Minimum Maximum Mean Std.\nDeviation\nFace-to-Face interactive model\n(1) My submissions are made directly to my supervisor or to his/her office 20 1.00 5.00 4.14 1.13\n(2) I have direct and interpersonal interaction with my supervisor on my submissions 20 1.00 5.00 4.30 .88\n(3) My supervisor and I have interpersonal discussions on feedback on my work 20 1.00 5.00 4.04 .84\n(4) My supervisor gives me direct feedback on my work/write up 20 1.00 5.00 4.11 .85\n(5) My supervisor gives me the opportunity to make my own contributions and\njustifications for my positions 20 1.00 5.00 3.91 .96\n(6) Feedback from my supervisor includes oral/verbal face to face discussion 20 1.00 5.00 3.35 1.22\nFace-to-Face noninteractive model\n(7) I submit my written work directly to my supervisor or to his/her office 228 1.00 5.00 2.14 1.24\n(8) Feedbacks are mainly written comments 228 1.00 5.00 3.91 1.09915\n(9) I am not given the opportunity to discuss or justify my position 228 1.00 5.00 2.31 1.25\n(10) Feedback from my supervisor are mainly directives and instructions 228 1.00 5.00 3.11 1.20\n(11) There is not much interpersonal interaction with my supervisor 228 1.00 5.00 2.53 1.38\nICT-based interactive model\n(12) I forward my work to my supervisor through his/her email 228 1.00 5.00 1.70 .84\n(13) I discuss my work with my supervisor(s) through phone/skype/chat forum 228 1.00 2.00 1.47 .50\nICT-based noninteractive model\n(14) I send my written work to my supervisor his/her through email 20 1.00 2.00 1.56 .49\n(15) Feedbacks are received through the email without further discussions 20 1.00 2.00 1.51 .50\nSatisfaction with dissertation supervision 20 1.00 2.00 1.56 .49\n(16) Availability of supervisor when needed 20 1.00 5.00 2.58 1.29\n(17) Supervisor’s effort to understand difficulties you are faced with 20 1.00 5.00 2.32 1.17\n(18) Supervisor’s provision of additional information relevant to your topic 20 1.00 5.00 2.28 1.32\n(19) Supervisor’s guidance on topic selection and refinement 20 1.00 5.00 2.25 1.08\n(20) Supervisor’s provision of feedback on your work 20 1.00 5.00 2.18 .94\n(21) Supervisor’s guidance on methods/technical issues of your research 20 1.00 5.00 2.35 1.00\nDevelopment of research-related skills\n(22) I have learnt to develop my ideas and present them in a written form 20 1.00 5.00 2.09 .87\n(23) My analytic skills have been sharpened 20 1.00 4.00 1.98 .81\n(24) I have developed the ability to plan my own work 20 1.00 5.00 1.97 .90\n(25) My skill in writing research articles have been enhanced 20 1.00 4.00 1.95 .91\n(26) I have more confidence in tackling possible research problems in my field 20 1.00 4.00 2.03 .78\nbased on a five-point Likert-type scale of strongly agree (5),\nagree (4), undecided (3), disagree (2), and strongly disagree\n(1).

Dominant Research Supervision Models/Styles Used in\nthe Process of Doctoral Students’ Dissertation Supervision.\nThe categorization of students into each of the models for\nwhich they had the highest mean rating showed that greater\nproportion of doctoral students (87.3%) in the dissertation\nsupervision process engage often in the “face-to-face interactive\nmodel” while very few doctoral students (12.7%) engage\noften in the “face-to-face noninteractive model” (Table 3).\n5.2. Relative Satisfaction with Dissertation Supervision among\nStudents within the Different Dissertation Supervision Models.\nThe overall mean satisfaction for dissertation supervision\nfor the face-to-face interactive model was 3.64 while that of\nstudents under face-to-face noninteractive model was 2.11.\nThe mean value for the former was above the scale average\nof 3.00 while that of students within the noninteractive was\nbelow the scale average. Therefore, while students who were\nsupervisedwith the face-to-face interactionmodel rated their\nsatisfaction with the whole dissertation supervision experience\nabove average, those supervised using noninteractive\nmodel reported being less satisfied.Their standard deviations\nwere also wide apart (1.08 and .59), respectively. The high\nstandard deviation of the face-to-face interactive models\nshows that there is large variability in satisfaction among\nstudents in that group when compared to those in Noninteractive\nmodels.\nThe use of 𝑡-test to examine the significance of the\nmeandifference showed that differencewas significant, 𝑡(226)\n= 11.52, 𝑃 < 0.05. It was concluded that students who\nmost frequently engaged in face-to-face interactive model\nof dissertation supervision were likely to be more satisfied\nthan thosewhomostly engaged in face-to-face noninteractive\nmodel of dissertation supervision (Table 4).\n5.3. Perceived Contribution of Dissertation Supervision to\nDoctoral Students’ Development of Research-Related Skills in\nRelation to the Different Dissertation Supervision Models.\nThe overall mean rating of students on the contribution\nof dissertation to the development of their research-related\nskills was 3.50 for students who mostly use the face-to-face\ninteractivemodel and 3.35 for students under the face-to-face\nnoninteractive model. Although there is a mean difference\nof .15 in favour of the face-to-face interactive model, the\ntwo mean values were slightly above the scale average of\n3.00. Their standard deviation seems comparable relative to\ntheir mean. By thesemean ratings, doctoral students believed\nthat their dissertation supervision experience has moderate\ncontribution to the development of their research-related\nskills.\nThe 𝑡-test results confirmed that the mean difference\nbetween the two groups was not significant as shown by\nthe 𝑡(226) = .65, 𝑃 > 0.05. It was concluded that students\nunder face-to-face interactive model of dissertation supervision\nand those under face-to-face noninteractive model of\ndissertation do not differ in their views on contribution of\ndissertation supervision to development of research-related\nskills (Table 5).\n6. Discussion of Findings\nThis study was aimed at determining the dominant doctoral\ndissertation supervision models in use in a university setting,\nstudents’ rating of their satisfaction with supervision\nexperience, and the contribution of this experience to the\ndevelopment of their research-related skills. One of themajor\nfindings was that face-to-face interactive model was not only\nthemost frequently usedmodel but also themost widely used\nwhile the ICT-based models (interactive and noninteractive)\nwere almost never used. This seems to support the position\nheld by Gurr [27] that “passive” model of supervision is\nnot acceptable in a university system. Literature showed\nthat there is a wide consensus among scholars that doctoral\n', 'Education Research International 7\nTable 4: 𝑡-test for difference in doctoral students’ satisfaction with dissertation supervision by two models of dissertation supervision.\nSupervision models 𝑁 Mean Std.

However, these two models did not\ndiffer significantly in their contribution to development of\nresearch skills in the student. This could be as a result of the\ndynamism in dissertation supervisory interaction reported\nby Gurr [27] which suggests that each model (hands-on or\nhands-off) is relevant at different stages of the students’ work.\nThree possible conclusions could be that the supervisor’s\nhands-off (noninteraction) at certain stages of the work is\nan opportunity for the student to work independently and\nacquiremore skills independently or that supervisors “handson”\nor interaction practice at some point of the dissertation\nmay be an inhibition to the students’ development. Further\npossibility could be viewed in the nature and quality of the\nfeedback given by the supervisors, the nature of the interaction\nbetween the supervisor and the supervisee and the\nsupervisee’s ability to undertake the dissertation component\nof the doctoral programme.\n7. Conclusion\nThe dissertations produced by doctoral students in some\nNigerian universities have been judged to be below standard.\nThere is also low completion rate in the programme in which\nsome scholars attribute to dissertation supervision problem.\nThe lack of commensurate policy and research attention on\ndoctoral programme, especially in doctoral supervision, both\nat the national and institutional levels might be a factor\ncontributing to these.This work therefore examined the doctoral\nthesis supervision models in one university, students’\nsatisfaction with these models and possible contribution\nto the development of research-related skills. It found that\nalthough the face-to-face interactive model was the most\nwidely used and that students supervised using this model\nwere more satisfied with dissertation supervision, they did\nnot report greater development in research-related skills than\nthose supervised with face-to-face non-interactive model.\nThis questions the quality of feedback given to students\nby their supervisors, the quality of interaction between\nthe supervisors and supervisees and perhaps the quality of\nstudents enrolled into the programme.\nICT-based models are yet to be adopted in the doctoral\ndissertation process despite their potential for reducing the\nhigh workload lecturers experience in this university. There\nis therefore the need to create awareness by the institution.\nThe findings open up new vistas for further research and\nopportunity for changing institutional practices as regards\ndoctoral dissertation supervision and skill development.\nThe authors acknowledge some of the limitations of this\nstudy. Although this study provided a detailed description of\nthe context of this study to facilitate evaluation of applicability\nof the findings to different contexts, it is still a single\ninstitutional study. Only students’ perspective was covered in\nthis study, future research study may undertake a comparative\nanalysis of supervisors’ and supervisees’ perspectives.\nFurthermore, the study did not take into cognizance the\ndisciplinary differences and practices in research which may\naffect research supervision practices. These and other factors\nwhich may account for students’ development of researchrelated\nskills need to be explored further in research.\nConflict of Interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] D.
