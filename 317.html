NEVADA, SATURDAY. JUXE 19, 1909.\nFIVE FEET OF HIGH GRADE\nMN BELMONT IS FEATURE\njf Week\'s Developments In the Various Prop\nerties Show a Condition Most\n, Satisf acrory.\nThe main feature of this week\'s report of the developments In the\nmines of the Tonopah district is the continued Improvement in the\nshowing in the lower levels of the Balmont. At the bottom of the winze\ndriven from the 1056 level of that property there are exposed five feet of\nhigh grade ore. The winze will be dispatched another 100 feet from\nwhich points crosscuts will be run for the purpose of prospecting the ter\nritory contiguous to the vein.\nThe reports of the other properties show an excellent condition. Ship\nments have been made from the West End, the new ten-drill compressor\nhas arrived for the MacNamara and is being installed. Excellent progress\nhas made during the week in grading for the Extension\'s new mill, while\nthe recent discoveries in the Montana-Tonopah are proving satisfactory. A\ndetailed account of the week\'s operations follows:\nnectton with the 1000-foot level, In\norder to get better air in the lower\nworkings.\nBELMONT.\nSuperintendent Brady Is pushing\nthe development work ahead in the\nBelmont at a rapid rate and the ore\nbodies on the lower levels are look\ning better at the expiration of each\nshift. The interest in the workings\nis centered at present chiefly in the\neast drift on the Belmont vein sent\nout from the bottom of the 1056\nwinze, where the vein has widened\nout until the face now shows about\nfive feet of high grade ore. The\nwinze will be sent down another 100\nfeet on the dip of the vein and when\n\'the desired point is reached crosscuts\nwill be sent out to prospect the terri\ntory.\n900-foot level A crosscut is being\ndriven noriheast from a point 900\nfeet east and north of the main shaft\nto connect with a raise from stope\nNo. 9 west on the Belmont vein from\nthe 1000-foot level, which has been\nput up to a point corresponding with\nthe 900-foot level. This raise exposed\nconsiderable low grade ore and the\ncrosscut is being sent out In order to\nprospect the vein on this level, and\nalso to give better ventilation in this\nsection of the mine. Stoping con\ntinues on the South vein, with no\nparticular change to note, the back of\nthe stope exposing an average of one\nand one-half feet of good milling ore.\n1000-foot level Stoping is going\non steadily on the South vein, east\nof the shaft, and an average of from\nthree to four feet of good milling ore\nis being extracted. The vein In the\nJfct end of the stope is showing\niwre strength than at any time yet.\nWork in the face of the west drift on\nthe Occidental vein has been suspend\ned temporarily, in order to allow\nthem to clear out the waste and put\nin timbers preparatory to starting\nnew stopes. The crosscut from No.\n2 east drift on the Belmont vein,\nwhich was sent out from the 125-foot\npoint of 1056 winze, shows broken\nnp quartz in the face, carrying some\nvalues. The stope on this vein above\nthe\' east drift is being sent up at one\nend for the purpose of making con-\n1100-foot level The east drift on\nthe Belmont vein from the bottom of\n1056 winze was advanced twenty-six\nfeet and is now out 235 feet from the\nwinze. . This drift has shown the\nvein to be very irregular in width,\nvarying from one to four feet. Dur\ning the past two weeks the vein has\nbeen extremely narrow and produced\nbut little ore, but this weeks shows a\ngreat Improvement, the face exposing\nfour feet of high grade ore, which Is\nthe best showing yet made in this\nledge on this level. The west drift\nfrom the winze on this vein is out\neighty-six feet, having been on the\nvein for the past thirty feet, which\nshows an average width of one and\none-half feet of ore carrying good\nmilling values. The raise from the\nwest drift on the stringer cut by the\nnorth crosscut from the 1054 winze\nwhich was sent up at a point fifty\nfive feet from the crosscut, is now\ntwenty-one feet above the level, the\ntop exposing from two to three feet\nof good milling ore. The raise from\nthe east drift on this stringer, thirty\nfeet east of the crosscut, is up twenty\none feet and exposes a foot of very\ngood ore. No work has been done in\nthe face of either the east or west\ndrift. In the stopes on the Mizpah\nvein, east and west of 1054 winze\nthe ore body shows greater strength\nthan ever and now varies from twen\nty to thrity feet in width, every pound\nof which carries milling values. The\nsouth crosscut from the 1100-foot\nstation of the shaft Is now out 839\nfeet, the face being in a fault thought\nto be the Stone Cabin, and exposing\nbroken up quartz carrying some val\nues. It is expected this crosscut will\nencounter the ore body to the east of\nthe fault..\nMOXTAXA TOXOPAH.\nThe workings of the Montana were\nextended 201 feet during the past\nweek. Several new veins or stringers\nthat have been recently encountered\nare being developed and are proving\nup satisfactory. The mill crushed\n902 tons of ore during the week, ob\ntaining a recovery of 89 per cent. The\nmill was stopped for about nine hours\nowing to the cleaning of the reser\nvoir. The regular bi-monthly melt of the\ncyanide precipitates is now on, and\nshould be finished by tomorrow night,\nthe result of which will be the pro\nduction of from twenty-two to twenty-five\nbars of bullion, weighing\nabout eighty pounds each.\n390-foot level The west drift-under\nthe stope on the Triangle vein\nwas advanced thirteen feet along\nthree feet of good ore, with the vein\nshowing up strong in the face. A\ncrosscut, sent south Into the hanging\nwall of the stope at a point about\nthirty-five feet above the level, has\njust encountered a vein at the 25\nfoot point which shows good values,\nbut Its width is not known at this\nwriting, owing to not enough work\nhaving been done. A crosscut will be\nstarted from the level, directly un\nderneath the crosscut from the stope,\nto intersect the ore body, so that the\nvein may be drifted on and develop\ned. Stoping continues on the main\nTriangle vein. This stope, now 300\nfeet long, is being carried upward and\nwestward, and shows an ore body two\nto eight feet in width which carries\ngood milling values.\n465-foot level The west drift on\nthe Triangle vein was advanced fif\nteen feet on the\' hanging wall side of\nthe vein. The drift is being followed\nup by stopes which show from seven\nto eight feet, all of which is milling\nore, with the best values lying on the\nfootwall. The stope on the Martha\nvein has been extended to the east.\nand exposes an average of two feet of\nmilling ore. The stope on the Mac\ndonaid vein, 1000 feet west of the\nshaft, continues to produce from two\nto three feet of good sulphide ore.\n515-foot level The east drift on\nthe Triangte vein was advanced\ntwenty-six feet, passing through the\nrhyolite and Into the andesite. The\nvein has been badly broken up, but\nshows high grade values in spots. The\nnew west drift started last week on a\nbranch of the South vein was ex\ntended twenty-one feet, showing\nabout a foot of milling ore in the\nface. The interdrift on the Macdon\nald vein, 1000 feet west of the shaft,\nwas advanced eight feet on about\nfour feet of ore, two of which is high\ngrade sulphide ore. The stope on\nthe Triangle vein, was carried easter\nly fifteen feet during the past weeK\nexposing three feet of good milling\nore, which is about the average width\nof the ledge. About sixty, feet back\nof the east end of this stope a raise\nis beine ssnt through to the 465-\nfoot level and shows an average of\nthree feet of ore thus far.\n565-foot, intermediate level The\nwest drift on the South vein was ex\ntended twenty feet, the face at pres\nent being in.a fault. The drift will be\ncontinued, however, in the hopes of\npicking up the ore body west of the\nfault. No. 7 drift, which has been\nfollowing a vein about 300 feet east\nof the shaft, has been sent ahead\ntwenty-two feet along an average of\nthree feet of ore, carrying milling\nvalues. The stopes on the Martha\nvein eastf the shaft continue to pro\nduce about three feet of good milling\n615-foot level The raise from the\nw.est crosscut under the winze on the\nTriangle vein is now up forty-five\nfeet, the top showing three feet of\nox-id ized milling ore. A short raise\nhas been put up at a point 200 feet\neast of the shaft for the purpose of\nhandling ore from the stope above.\n765-foot level The main north\ncrosscut from the shaft was advanced\nfourteen feet and is out about 1720\nfeet, the face still showing rhyolite.\nTOXOPAH MIXING.\nIn the entire workings of the Ton\nopah Mining company there is prac\ntically no change to note. The\namount of development work has de\ncreased during the week owing to\nthe compressors failing to supply the\namount of air needed and the man\nagement is at present waiting tho\narrival of a new compressor ordered\nsome time ago. The\' development\nwork for the week totaled 237 feet,\nwhich was divided as follows: Miz\npah 163, Silver Top 29 and, the Red\nPlume 45 feet. The Mizpah shaft\nwas lowered twelve feet and has now\nattained a depth of , 1426 feet with\nno change in the formation.\nIn the Silver Top workings, noth\ning but stoping is being done above\nthe 540-foot level. The stopes are\nbeins carried along east and west of\nthe shaft oti the 240, 340 and 440-\nfoot levels, the Silver Top vein pro\nducing the bulk of the ore east of the\nshaft and the Valley View vein west\nof the shaft. Both veins show an\naverage width of from fonr to five\nfeet on the various levels and carry\ngood milling values.\n540-foot level Work has been re\nsumed In the west drift from the\nsouth crosscut from the main west\ndrift, which is following about two\nfeet of quartz carrying milling values.\nDuring the past few days the vein\nhas shown some improvement in\nstrength and looks very promising.\nMizpah, 200-foot level The east\nInterdrift from the raise sent up on\nthe ledge cut by the south crosscut\nfrom the main east drift lost the ore\non a fault during the week, but it\nwas again picked up by a short cross\ncut to the south, and now shows\nthree feet of low-grade milling ore in\nthe face. .\n300-foot level The raise sent up\non the ledge cut by the south cross\ncut from the main east drift was ad\nvanced during the week and contln\nues to show from two to three feet of\nmilling ore in the top. The raise\nfrom the intermediate drift under\nthe Mizpah fault is being sent up on\nthree to four feet of milling ore, the\nvein showing up considerably strong\ner in the raise than at any time in\nthe drift.\n500-foot level A new raise is be\ning put up on the Mizpah vein under\nthe east stope, for the purpose of\nmore easily handling the ore opened\nup in the footwall of the stope. The\neast intermediate drift from the\nBrougher shaft, \' which is following\nthe Mizpah vein midway between the\n500 and 600-foot levels, continues to\nshow a good face of ore, the vein\naveraging about five feet in width\nand carrying good milling values.\nRed Plume, 500-foot level The\nwest drift from the north eroscut\nfrom the 500-foot station of the\' Red\nPlume shaft, which corresponds with\nthe 600-foot level of Mizpah work\nings, continued to show considerable\nquartz during the week, but no val\nues have been encountered. Qufte an\nimprovement has taken place in the\nnorth crosscut being sent out just\nwest of the shaft on this level. While\nquartz has been in evidence all along\nin these workings, the values have\nbeen very low, but the face now ex\nposes mill values, which Is very en\ncouraging, as this work is being car\nried on in entirely new ground.\nThe mill report for the week shows\nthat an average of ninety-two out of\nthe 100 stamps were dropping con\nstantly, crushing 3090 tons of ore, of\nan averave value of $21.50 a ton\nThe bullion shipment consisted of\nfifty-four bars, valued at $580 each\nand twenty-three tons of concen\ntra\'tes worth $600 a ton, making the\ntotal bullion shipments amount to\n$59,700. An average extraction of\n90 per cent was recorded.\nhigh grade milling ore exposed in the\nwinze from the west drift Is showing\nup as strong as ever, there being fully\nsix feet of ore carrying good values\nexposed. At present this is the best\nshowing In the mine, and when it is\nopeaed up and stoping started should\nfurnish a very large tonnage of ore.\nThere is no change to note in No. 5B\nstope, which is producing the regular\nthree to four feet of milling ore.\n275-foot level The upraise from\nthe south crosscut from the north\nwest drift was continued a few feet\nand still exposes a body of from two\nto three feet of good ore. Stoping\ncontinues in No. 2 and No. 3 stopes,\nwhich shows the vein to have a width\nof about three feet, carrying good\nmilling values.\n300-foot level A few feet were\nadded to the raise being sent up from\n(Continued on Page Four.1\nMACNAMARA.\nThe MacNamara\'s new ten-drill\ncompressor and motor arrived here\nduring the week ..and workmen are\nnow busily engaged in Installing it.\nOn account of lack of air the opera\ntions under ground were somewhat\nretarded during the last week and\nsix shifts were lost, which greatly re\nduced the extraction. The company\nhas been securing a portion of the air\nfor the drills from the Extension, but\nowing to that plant having closed,\nthey were forced to do most of the\nwork with hand drills.

Think about this.\nELLENDALE LOOKS\nLIKE A WINNER\nArrivals yesterday from the new\ncamp of Ellendale speak glowing\'y\nof the various showings in the camp\nthat in the brief space of a few days\nhas set the mining world agog. Let\nit be said here that, unlike the many\ndiscoveries that brought the south\nern Nevada desert the attention of\nthe world and added and are add\'ng\ntheir millions to the wealth of the\nworld, Ellendale has the unique dis\ntinction of being the very first en?up\nthat has met with the approval of all\nwho have seen it.\nReturning visitors bring with tV.m\nspecimens of marvelously rich ore\nand stories of showings that muf.i\nat least arouse the curiosity of the\nmost conservative. Mine Inspector\nStuart is one who reposes a great\ndeal of confidence in Ellendale. Up-\non his return to Tonopah after a\nvisit to ths camp, he stated that the\nshowing was all that was claimed for\nit. In his opinion, the formation and\ngeneral characteristics of the camp\nare indicative of future greatness. Of\ncourse, he can see no further in the\nground than any one else, but, like\nmany others, bases his opinion upon\nan experience in the mining fields of\nthe country covering a period of\nmany years.\nEverywhere one is confronted with\nhigh grade specimens.

The south crosscut which\nis being sent out to get under the ore\nbody exposed in the winze from the\n200-foot level was advanced a short\ndistance.

The usual -amount of ors is\ncoming from the stope forty feet cist\nof the old east stope, the vein show\ning a width of three feet of good\nmilling ore in the back.\nr\nL\n1 1 i\nfin Ynn Want tn I\nPeel Light\nHatted?\nGeorge Foley of Round Mountain\nhas raturned from Ellendale almost\nloaded down with specimens that\nmake the eye water; Judge Sawle\npossesses many that are extremely\nrich; Curley Graham and a score of\nothers display Ellendale specimers\nuntil one feels that he is not In the\nswim unless he carries several dol\nlars\' worth of Ellendale ore In his\npockets.\nAmong the latest arrivals to speak\nencouragingly of the camp is County\nRecorder Puddy Grimes, who return ed\nto Tonopah last evening after a\nvisit of several days to the scene of\nthe excitement. He voices tha be\nlief that "The Wash," as it is famil\niarly called, will within a short time\ntake its place with the leaders of\nthis already great section of the\nstate. "I see no logical reason why\nit should not make good," is the way\nhe expresses himself. "I have spent\nseveral days in and about the new\ncamp covering a great deal of the\nterritory In a personal examination\nof the different properties. The\nshowings at present are undoubtedly\nthe most wonderful that have ever\nbeen seen on the surface in southern\nNevada. On top of that, it is the\nuniversal opinion of some of the\nbest known mining men in this lo\ncality that the ore should hold its\nvalue with depth and that the ledges\nshould prove of the permanent or\nder. The camp bears all the ear\nmarks of one destined to make its\nmark in the mining world."\nWEST END.\nThe shipments from the West End\nfor the week aggregated 100 tons\nwhich was sent to the Western Ore\nPurchasing company at Millers.

No. 1\nraise from the west lateral drift, 200\nfeet west of the shaft, is up thirty\nfour feet above the level, with the top\nIn low grade ore. Work has been\nsuspended In this raise for the pres\nent. No. 2 raise, fifty feet west of\nNo. 1 raise, is up thirty-nine feet, the\ntop exposing a fair, grade of milling\nore. The stope at the top of No. 8\nraise, 100 feet west of the shaft,\' con\ntinues to produce from four to six\nfeet of excellent .ore.
