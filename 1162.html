From\nindependent films to oral history projects, digital shorts to photo documentaries, gentrification\nis fast becoming one of the most prevalent and relevant topics in urban nonfiction.\n(For a partial listing of projects by city, see the end of this article.)\nThe current focus on gentrification extends themes of neighborhood change and territorial\nconflict long present, if not dominant in urban documentaries and community and\nurban sociology generally. Earlier processes of urban restructuring—from suburbanization\nand urban renewal to fiscal crisis and planned shrinkage—were powerfully portrayed\nin films like “Crisis in Levittown” (1957), “Metropolitan Avenue” (1966), and “Style Wars”\n(1979), to choose just three prominent U.S. examples of documentaries made over successive\ndecades.\nToday, across much of the Global North and South, gentrification is an increasingly\npowerful force of neighborhood change and source of territorial conflict. Not surprisingly,\ndocumentarians are again picking up their cameras. As in earlier generations, these\nvisual accounts do more than text alone to capture the emotional and experiential nuances\nof reactions to large-scale urban change and to make sense of the complex and\noften opaque social and political forces behind it.\nBut of course gentrification documentaries, like gentrification itself, are not simply a\nmodern iteration of an earlier form. They require that we get to know a different cast of\ncharacters and a new plot line, as distinct from common narratives—whether those involving\ntop–down urban renewal driven by overzealous urban planners, or bottom up, quasi-\necological neighborhood change driven by cyclical in-migration and out-migration. While\nits pioneers may have had other ideas, gentrification has always been the quintessential\nstory of urban exchange value trumping urban use value. Especially in its current\nCity & Community 13:4 December 2014\ndoi: 10.1111/cico.12083\nC© 2014 American Sociological Association, 1430 K Street NW, Washington, DC 20005\n403\n', 'CITY & COMMUNITY\nglobalized form, it is a process of capitalist urban development driven by powerful\nand often unseen private actors—including real estate investors, developers, and\ncorporations—and coordinated by economic development agencies and public private\npartnerships, which create the zoning, tax, and regulatory environment that incentivizes\nspeculative urban development and facilitates eviction and displacement.1\nThese are shadowy and contentious urban processes that are far from easy for urban\nscholars and students to research. Many of the major players are not as accessible as\ngovernment officials, and the minutes of their closed-door meetings are typically not\narchived. Meanwhile, the surface dynamics of gentrification are highly cultural and affectual,\nand tricky to convey in writing alone. They involve changes in the products in\ncorner stores, the aesthetics of building codes, the vibe on the street at night, the spread\nof surveillance cameras, or the image of the community found in ads for new luxury\nbuildings. Race and class are ever present in these representations and experiences, but\nnever named. Then we have the antigentrification movement, with its many forms—from\ngraffiti to legal contest to protest marches—and wide range of “right to the city” groups—\nfrom tenant advocates and community based organizations to urban gardeners. The diversity\nand passion of their voices can be a challenge to capture on the page. By aiming\ntheir cameras at all of these dynamics—on the surface, in the streets, and behind the\nscenes—documentarians play a vital role in exposing and interpreting gentrification for\na broader public. They also provide an invaluable resource for teachers and scholars in\nurban sociology.\nURBAN GENTRIFICATION DOCUMENTARIES AS A GENRE\nAfter viewing some twenty documentaries on the theme, I would argue that these films\nand media projects constitute an emerging “genre”—complete with codes, conventions,\nand dominant motifs. One convention is that of first person narration, with many filmmakers\ndocumenting gentrification processes in their own communities and reflecting\non their own role in it. This reflexive approach can be illuminating as well as jarring at\ntimes. We see these two sides in films like “7th Street,” in which prominent director and\nactor Josh Pais documents and walks us through the 1990s era gentrification of New York\nCity’s East Village, the neighborhood where he grew up as a teenager. We see and feel\nwith him the successive blows to memory and community when, one by one, mom-andpop\nstores, gardens, and key neighborhood institutions are lost, and his friends on the\nstreet are pushed out. Yet toward the end, when Pais takes his shirt off and talks into the\ncamera about a sidewalk conflict he had with a “gang member,” we are left to wonder\nabout the goals of the film—psychological catharsis or social critique?—and about the\ndifferent version of events that might emerge were we to change this rather self-absorbed\nnarrator’s race, class, age, gender, sexuality, or years living in the community.\nAnother common motif might be that of the “good old-timers” versus “bad newcomers.”\nWhile most of the films work to uncover political and economic forces behind gentri-\nfication, they tend to elevate certain individual protagonists and emphasize their conflict\nwith others. Doing this without demonizing “gentrifiers” is a challenge—for documentarians\nas for scholars and activists—and some films succeed at this more than others. We\nwitness this uncomfortable balance in a film like the award-winning “Flag Wars,” directed\nby Linda Goode Bryant and Laura Poitras (2003). Shot cinéma vérité style in the Olde\n404\n', 'DOCUMENTARY FILM REVIEW ESSAY\nTowne neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio, the film does a remarkable job of tracing the\nslowly rising tension between two historically marginalized groups: working class African\nAmericans, who are longtime residents in the neighborhood, and new LGBT\nhomebuyers and real estate agents. The latter seek to renovate old, often derelict housing\nand prop up real estate values—such as by creating a new historical district designation.\nYet the former group, many of whom live on fixed incomes, can’t afford to upgrade their\nhomes to meet the new housing codes and so are threatened with displacement. While\nthe filmmakers strive to portray both sides, the focus on “war” between the groups may\nreproduce stereotypes about LGBT outsiders and interlopers, an issue that is never explicitly\naddressed in the film, while distracting from broader social forces.\nYet, despite the risk of cliché and stereotype (found in all genre films), many common\nqualities of urban gentrification documentaries helpfully reveal dynamics of gentrification\nacross regions and historic periods, allowing us to analyze similarities and differ-\nences. Most are low-budget films shot over many years in neighborhoods in the midst of\ngentrification, and as such provide invaluable visual records of slow transformations often\nassociated with collective amnesia and depoliticization. They also shine the spotlight\non class inequality and market pressures in the contemporary city. Many make creative\nuse of graphics and animation to illustrate obscure dynamics—like maps and timelines\nof evictions and displacement, flowcharts of complex policies and financial instruments,\nand diagrams of the intricate networks of the private and public actors behind redevelopment.\nMost are good at finding a diverse range of informed, impassioned “talking heads”\nand consultants—including many of our CUSS colleagues—and bringing their work to\na wider audience. And, through the art of editing and montage, many are adept at what\nwe might call demystification, bringing into clear focus and juxtaposition competing visions\nof the future of the city and who belongs there, while unpacking elaborate efforts\nat marketing high-end redevelopment.\nIn what follows, I highlight two films that do all of this particularly well, and conclude\nwith a list of films and media projects to consider for urban sociological research and\nteaching. While the two films I focus on are U.S.-based, the list at the end includes a\nmore international selection.\n“BOOM! THE SOUND OF EVICTION”\nProduced by the grassroots video collective Whispered Media in 2001, BOOM! documents\nthe impact of tech-driven gentrification in San Francisco’s Mission District, a his-\ntorically working class, immigrant neighborhood that, since the 1960s, has been the heart\nof the city’s Latino community as well as home to a sizable community of artists and nonprofit\ngroups. This is actually the first film I came across (back in the early 2000s) to\nrepresent the gentrification phenomenon for my urban sociology students, and may be\nconsidered a pioneer for the genre. Screening it in classrooms today provides interesting\nprehistory for what is arguably an even larger wave of gentrification sweeping San\nFrancisco—sparked by the move of Silicon Valley firms, employees, and transit networks\ninto the city, and accompanied by a new crop of documentary projects undoubtedly inspired,\nin part, by this film.\nBOOM! opens with archival footage of a public housing block being demolished\nby wrecking ball in 1999, and with it, the deafening sound referenced in the film’s\n405\n', 'CITY & COMMUNITY\nin-your-face title. Immediately clear is the filmmakers’ view that gentrification is no abstract\nor superficial phenomenon, but a force both real and violent, particularly for\nmid-century visions of the inclusive city that public housing represented. With the aid\nof campy clips from old Technicolor travelogues intercut with contemporary scenes of\nnew transplants living the high life, we learn of the title’s other referent: the “dot.com\nboom” of the late 1990s, celebrated for bringing about San Francisco’s rightful return to\nglobal city status. We see the dramatic physical and demographic manifestation of this\nboom: working class mixed-use neighborhoods giving way to luxury lofts, hip offices for\ntech start-ups, gourmet eateries, and the influx of hip, young, upwardly mobile, tech-savvy\nresidents.\nThus we are led to understand: One should not believe everything one hears about\nbooms. Rather than the miraculous result of tech and finance wizardry, we see public\npolicy, including lax rent laws and strong tax incentives, propping up a speculative\nbubble. As capital floods the area, Internet start-ups move in, buildings are razed and\nrenovated, rents soar, and eviction papers are served. Rather than producing a widely dispersed\nbounty of jobs and profits, the film shows how a boom can benefit a small group\nof entrepreneurs, investors, and developers while disadvantaging many more. One interviewee\nestimates the eviction of 15,000 people in 3 years. While hard numbers are not\nprovided, we are shown evidence of the displacement of hundreds of longtime residents,\nbusinesses, social service organizations, and community-based arts groups.2\nBOOM! then takes us on a bumpy, depressing drive along the back roads of the New\nEconomy. A large Latino family is given three days to get out when a new neighbor complains\nabout noise. A vibrant dance studio holds its final class. Across the bay in lower cost\nOakland, a no-cause eviction notice leaves a mother of five camping out with her family\nin a friend’s cramped apartment. The contrast between virtuous Mission residents and\nthe invading yuppie army, lounging in tony bistros, sipping strange, neon-hued cocktails,\ncan feel a bit heavy handed. Yet as Mayor Willie Brown, developers, and dotcom CEOs\ncelebrate the newcomers as evidence of urban revitalization, while ignoring or denying\nthe fate of evictees, their boosterism comes off as both heartless and starkly at odds with\nthe reality faced by many if not most low and middle income people in the city.\nNowhere is this clash more extreme than in an arresting segment in which an octogenarian\nMission resident is served with eviction papers. Having lived in her apartment her\nentire adult life, with nowhere to go, disoriented and distressed, she appeals to landlords,\nthe media, and the city, but to no avail. Shortly before she was to be forced out, she passed\naway. Enraged housing advocates argue that the stress of eviction led to her premature\ndeath, and she becomes a charged symbol in the antigentrification struggle.\nThe movie hangs on until the tech bubble bursts in 2000, exposing the abandonment\nand waste left in its wake. We are left wondering about the true nature of “booms,” the\nultimate fate of San Francisco, and broader questions about the right to the city in our\ntime.\nMY BROOKLYN\nIf “BOOM!” covered San Francisco’s Mission District during the bubble and crash of\nthe late 1990s/early 2000s, “My Brooklyn” picks up soon thereafter, covering the preand\npostcrash bubbles of 2006–2012 that turned Brooklyn into “the hippest city in the\n406\n', 'DOCUMENTARY FILM REVIEW ESSAY\nUnited States.” In this forceful combination of investigative journalism and personal\nmemoir, filmmakers Kelly Anderson, the director, and Allison Lirish Dean, chief researcher\n(with background in city planning), open with a tour of the gentrification of\nvarious Brooklyn neighborhoods Anderson has lived in. The latter’s concern is that, as a\nwhite, middle class, nonnative Brooklynite, she is the cause of the problem. Yet suspicion\nthat this doesn’t tell the whole story drives her to create a film that uncovers gentrification’s\npolitical and economic roots and moves beyond the oft-told tale of yuppies and\nbrownstones. Instead, it focuses on the massive, developer-driven plan for the redevelopment\nand commercial gentrification of Downtown Brooklyn.\nThe emotional and political heart of the film is Downtown’s Fulton Mall. Over Jamel\nShabazz’s black and white photos of life on the street in the 1970s, we learn of the\nMall’s historic role as the leading shopping street for New York’s African American and\nCaribbean communities. It was a destination for young people and families and a key\nsource for the fashion, hairstyles, and music video backdrops of early hip hop. Emblematic\nof downtown decline and resurgence in the United States, it offers a classic tale of\nthe entrepreneurial spirit albeit made possible by affordable real estate. Store-owners interviewed\nrecall how they turned around a street that had been abandoned and left for\ndead in the 1960s and 1970s, with remarkable results: As of 2004, the Mall was the third\nmost successful shopping area in New York (after Fifth and Madison avenues), attracting\n100,000 consumers a day. This was aided by the concentration of government buildings\nand large utilities in the area.\nBut then came the Downtown Brooklyn Plan. Along with its vision to rezone the area\nfor high end office and residential development the plan called for “revitalizing” the\nFulton Mall. Apparently the street’s bustling sneaker stores, bagel bakers, book vendors,\nbarbershops, snazzy suit emporia, and soul food restaurants weren’t vital enough for the\nnew targeted demographic. The film reveals how this very partial vision became a reality.\nWith generous subsidies from the city, tens of luxury towers would indeed rise on the\nBrooklyn skyline. Meanwhile, the majority of the mall’s small-business owners, after years\nof organizing, would be evicted. In contrast with the big-box stores moving in, they got\nno subsidies to relocate, nor even the courtesy of posting “We’ve Moved” fliers with their\nphone numbers for their decades-old clientele.\nLike the genre of which it’s a part, My Brooklyn makes certain arguments. First it attacks\nthe notion that gentrification is simply a natural process, in which “some people move in\nand others move out,” as historian and interviewee Craig Wilder puts it, and as the developers\nand planners featured would have us believe. Rather, as planning scholar Tom\nAngotti underscores, it is a choice, and a highly political one at that. The film shows us\nthe creative destruction unleashed as a result of this choice, with tragic consequences for\nlocal culture, community, and livelihood. The filmmakers link the plan to the 100-plus rezonings\nand multibillion dollar tax abatements for market-rate developers the Bloomberg\nadministration championed. They then follow the money, explicating the role of growth\nmachines like the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership and quasi-public city entities like the\nEconomic Development Corporation. We witness how, together, these entities draft and\npush through the plan outside the community review process.\nA second argument is about the powerful, unspoken role of race and class bias in\nthis mode of redevelopment. In one scene, the documentarians conduct interviews with\nwhite and black shoppers at a Brooklyn farmers market to gauge people’s opinions on\n407\n', 'CITY & COMMUNITY\nthe fate of the mall. Blacks may or may not frequent the mall, but speak of it with respect.\nWhites are either perplexed, never having visited or heard of it, or disparaging, wrinkling\ntheir noses at the very thought of it. In other scenes, as outraged activists howl over the\ndisplacement of their community, planning officials nod condescendingly, repeating the\nmantra “change is always difficult.” It is clear that those in power see little of value in this\nmajority Black, working class space and identify more with the apirations their affluent,\nmajority white constituents.\nUnable to afford an apartment near downtown Brooklyn, Anderson moves further out\nin the borough to Sunset Park—knowing full well that she is likely part of the first wave\nof gentrification for this relatively affordable, Asian-American and Latino neighborhood.\nThis leads to her final argument: There should be another way. Cities should be able to\ndevelop and grow without destroying the diversity and inclusivity that make them great.\nTo illustrate this—and in an effort to detract from the extensive focus on her identity as\nfilmmaker and gentrifier, to which many who see this film will not relate—the film concludes\nwith a diverse array of residents speaking to the camera about what “my Brooklyn”\nmeans to them. As in BOOM!, the final scenes leave us wondering (perhaps another motif\nof the genre): How can ordinary residents define the city in their own terms, and how\ncan they achieve the power to make their visions a reality?\nWe know that the history of the modern city has always been one of displacement and\nstruggle, and that class, culture, and political organizing have always played a decisive\nrole in determining the winners and losers of urban development. Films like BOOM!, My\nBrooklyn, and those in the list below help us understand the role of both gentrification\nand anti-gentrification resistance in this history. Thus, they provide a valuable tool for the\nclassroom and our own research on these subjects.\nNotes\n1Classic literature on gentrification includes: Neil Smith, “Toward a Theory of Gentrification: A Back to\nthe City Movement by Capital, not People.” Journal of the American Planning Association 45 (4): 538–48, 1979,\nand “New Globalism, New Urbanism: Gentrification as Global Urban Strategy,” Antipode 34 (3): 434–57, 2002;\nSharon Zukin, Loft Living: Culture and Capital in Urban Change, New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press,\n1989 (soon to come out in its 25th anniversary edition).
