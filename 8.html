His progress is slow\nas he seems to be stopped by every person he\n: meets, and he has a warm handshake and a cheer\nful "Good Morning" for all. You follow him to his\nplace of business and see him radiating the same\nsunshine and cheerful greeting, and you find he is\nknown to every employe on the place as "Uncle."\nWatch him, if he is a merchant, as the store\nbegins to fill with customers. Each receives the\nsame cordial welcome. To the ladies he is es\npecially courteous, and you are surprised to see\nthat courtesy unshaken even when confronted\nby one whom you by no stretch of the imagina\ntion could term a lady. He sees your surprise\n;and—"for the sake of the sex," he smiles.\nNow watch him as he starts for home toward\ncard them all.\nnotable ones.

On account of his\navordupoise he has to draw the line at the hoop\n\' which another offers him. But he starts it off\n;\nfor the youngsters to pursue.\nI A little further on he is accosted by a bevy of\nsmall girls, who are in their element as they swarm\n: around him, clamoring for a story, teasing him to\njump rope, or even rifling his pockets for sus\njpected sweets.\nI You see him as he reaches his home, when\nithe good wife meets him at the gate. She has a\nsad tale for his ear. Sorrow has entered a neigh\nbor\'s home. At once he is all sympathy, and with\nout waiting to enter his own door he passes on to\nthe house of sorrow. Perhaps he can offer nought\nbut sympathy, but this comes so plainly from the\nheart and is accompanied by such a warm clasp\n° the hand, hat it carries its blessed message\nof comfort and sympathy.\n1 Now you are beginning to appreciate the true\nj reagon £ or jjj 8 popularity.

Boxing in Pittsburg and Phila\ndelphia has been controlled success\nfully by the police for many years. |\nIn Pittsburgh the other day the Police\nCommissioner refused to permit a\nwell known boxer to appear at a local\nclub because the latter had admitted\na charge of faking in Australia. In\nPhiladelphia the police have frequent\nly barred pugilists who hve indulged\nin shady bouts or have failed to live\nup to articles of agreement. There\nis no reason, therefore, why the police\ndepartments in New York State can\nnot regulate boxing with satisfactory\nresults. They should be empowered\nto keep out unscrupulous promoters\nand crooked boxers, also to prevent\nbrutal fights and the appearance of\npoorly conditioned boxers in the ring.\nThe right of the police to revoke a li\ncense for a violation of the building\nand fire laws, for overselling and for\narranging swindles would clean up\nthe game.\nFerdinand Schupp, the Giants\'\nyoung left hander, who startled the\nfans last season by suddenly pitching\nphenomenal ball, has asked for a sub\nstantial increase in salary. Schupp\nled the National League pitchers in\neffectiveness and helped the Giants\nto hang up their world\'s record of\ntwenty-six consecutive victories. He\nis entitled to a raise, under the cir\ncumstances, but in naming the figures\nthat have blocked negotiations for\nthe present Schupp probably forgets (\nhow McGraw kept him on the New I\nYork club\'s pay roll for three years\nwhen he was of little or no value.\nbe\nMcGraw\'s patience made Schupp a\nsuccess. The Giants leader expects j\nto have no trouble with the young |\nsouthpaw when they get together at\nMarlin. •\nBelleair, Fla., recently has come\nforward as a centre of winter golf,\nand has two testing eighteen-hole\ncourses on which events, both for pro\nfessionals and amateurs, are constant\nly being held. The new Palma Cei\nGolf Club, of which Jim Barnes has\ncharge, is at Tampa. The Atlantic\nBeach Country Club of Atlantic Beach\nFla., has a new eighteen-hole course, ,\nand also an auxiliary short-hole\ncourse for mashie and putting prac\nor\ntice.
