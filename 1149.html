Dispatches Irom\nLouisville estimate the \'loss at\n$ J ,000,OCO in that city alone while\non below iji the western part of the\nstate the loss will be as great pro\nportionntely.\nIn Cincinnati the water rose to\nsuch a height that the Union Depot\nhnd to be ubandoned and trains\nbrought into the city from other\nroutes coming into this city.\nNot only along the Ohio was the\ndestruction wrought but all over\nKentucky in the smaller streams the\nflood loss was felt. At Pineville the\nlighting plunt was put out of com\nmission as was also the water\nworks. At Middlesboro Yellow\nCrtek as usual went on a rampage\nand for several hours last week the\npeople living in the lower portion\nof the city were compelled to seek\nttluge on higher grounds until the\nwater recceded. Here the property\nI iss was great.\nIn this city the flood did no great\ndumngc although thi river reached\na high stage. Trains have arrived\n!ntr here lor several days on ac\ncount of the delays caused by high\nwater, especially those from the\nnorth.\nThe Kentucky Rivrr overflowed\nthe early part of the week and for\nseTrral hours Franklort was under\nwater Not isil at Franklort but\nall along the course of the river was\n\' the loss kit.\nOn account oi a landslide at Rock\nIlnven lost Saturday night the L\nII & SI. L. Railroad could not send\nout a train Irom Louisville last\nSunday. Here the track was cov\nered by several feet ol rock, mud\nand debris.\nThe rise in the Cumberland which\nwas here the last of the week is just\nnow being felt in the western part\nof Tennessee where it empties in to\nthe Mississippi. The following As\nsociated Press Dispatch from Nash\nville gives report of the conditions\nin that City:\n"A rninlnll of two inches today\nhas started the Cumberlahd River\nto rising again, again and a maxi\nmum gauge here of 48 feet is pre\ndicted tonight by the weather bu\nreau the highest in the many years\n"The heavy rains of some days\nago caused the river to register a\nguagc of 4G feet and a slight tall\nhad begun when n further down\npour started the stream to rising\n"It is estimated that 300 families\nhave been driven from their homes\nhere by the high water. Cellars ol\nbusiness houses near the river front\nare flooded and the baseball park is\ncovered by backwater \'\nIn some sections of Lexington the\nflood cnufed an abandonment of\nhomes hist Saturday night and ear\nly Sunday morning. Sunday\'s edi\ntinn of the Leader contained the\nfollowing:\n"The recent heavy rain have\ncaused a great gutherittg of the\nwaters in the low section of the\ncity around Eddie Street, and raasy\nof the families were lorccd to leave\ntheir homes at a late hour Snturdav\nnight to escape being drowned in\ntheir beds. Lieutenant nines Bgnn\nand Patrolman Frank Sloan went\nto the assistance of some of the\nfamilies about 1;30 o\'clock Sunday\nmorning, and were able to take\npeople from their homes tu places\nof safety in the pnerol wagon the\nthe water being waist high in ome\nplaces.\n"The heavy rains which hnyv\'bccn\nfalling thr ughout Ken,iJ\'ck nnd\nsurrounding tcrritorjr\'tor the lust\ntwo dnys ho\'not only caused\ngreat damage to people living\nalopu\' streams, but have given\ngreat inconvenience locally.

The streets, especially those\nconstructed of wood block, arc so\nslippery that they arc traversed\nwith difficulty. Main Street, from\nthe C. & 0. crossing to the Viatlust\nstood under about nine inches ol\nwater the greater part of Saturday\nEverywhere the sewers have been\ntaxed to their utmost capacity, nnd\nin some places they have been\'\' un\nable to carry off the water as fast\nas it falls, giving the streets the ap\npearance of rivers.

Swectland who had a\ndisagreement last November and\nhave been at outs since that time, j\nA brief summary of the facts anil\ndeveloncments since the fire nre\nabout as follows: On the night bf\nOctober 30th about midnight fire\nwns discovered in Prof. Anderson\'s,\noffice which destroyed the interior\nof the office. Later several articles\nbelonging to the office were found\non the athletic field and other\nplaces on nnd about the campus.\nThe student body were almost as a\nwhole With Sweetlond in sympathy\nand n few hours previous to the fire\nhad made demonstrations showing\ntheir indignation against Prof.\nAnderson nnd it was believed by\nsome that probably one or more of\nthe students had set fire to the office\non account of their hatred of him.\nAn investigation by State Fire\nMarshall Uosworth who was as\nsisted by a finger print expert\nbrought out the fact that a small\nbrass clock found after the fire be\nlonging to the office of Prof. Ander\nson bore the finger print of Webb,\nnnd that with other evidence caus\ned a warrant to be issued against\nhim on this charge. He stoutly de\nnied this charge at the examination\ntrill that has been going on at\'\nLexington for more than a week\nbut was held on a bond of $500\nawaiting the action of the next Cir\ncuit Court.\nAt this trial Webb attempted to\nfix the charge upon Swectland bas\ning his claim upon the argument\nthat he (Swectland) was at times\nmentally unbalenccd, but this\ncharge was not sustained.\nA sen-ation was sprugg near the\nend of the trial when O. P. Ger\nliardt, a student swore thnt he met\nWebb and another student named\nHiiiL-r on the cntnniis the night of\nthe fire. This was\' denied bv Webb\nwho caused a warrant to be issued\nfor Gerlmrdt, charging him with\nperjury.\nLfutlerhaa been wanted ever since\nthe fiite and could not Iw located\nuntil last Saturday when he whs\ncaught in Ohio and brought back\nto Lexington where he made a con\nfession. The following in Monday\'s\nLexington Leader gives further par\nticulars: \'Thomas F. Hutler, former student\nat State University,, was arrested\nby Assistant Fire \'Marshall J. J.\nPeel in Youngstown, Ohio, Satur\nday alternoou at (J o.clock on a\nurnrrant sworn out by btnte rire\nMarshall C. C. Uosworth, charg\ning him with burning the office ol\nProcessor F. Paul Anderson of\nState University on the night of\nOctober 30, and brought to Lex\nington at 10 o\'clock Sunday night\nand taken to the Police Station,\nwhere he admitted to Mr. Ho\nworth that he was a participant in\nthe burning of Auderson\'s oflice. .\nButler implicated former Assis\ntant Couch Richard S. Webb in the\n(.oireiicc and said that Pal\n0r.\nhanlt, who is charged with perjury,\nwas probably correct when he\nstated that he hnd seen him (But\nlerj nnd Webb together on the\ncampus on the night of the fire, as I\nthey had walked together over!\nmist of the campus on thnt night.\nDirector of Athletics b R. Sweet\nland of Stnte Uuivcrsity, whose\nsanity vns attacked in the examin\ning trial of Webb in an attempt to\nprove Webb\'s innocence, host been\nemployed ns attorney for llutlcr to\ndefend him on the charge. Mr.\nSwectland has also been retnincd as\nattorney to defend Gerlmrdt in the\nperjury chnrge\nThe story of Butler\'s travels to\nevade the polite, which started on\nDecember 9 when he left Lexington,\nand ended with his arrest in Youngs\ntown S iturday. was told by. him\nas follows:\n"I Ielt on the Monday morning\nalter the Fire Marshal\'s investiga\ntion, for Cincinnati, and from there\nI took n boat to Louisville, but\nleft there immediately for Memphis\nwhere I obtained employment as a\nstructural iron worker. I staved\nthere long enough to mnke a little\nmoney, and then went to Hirraing\nhnin, Ala. I soon left there, how\never, coming back by Memphis, and\nwent on to Moberly, Mo., then to\nSt. Louis. I went from St. Louis\nto Hannibal and started work\nthere on a bridge across the Miss\nissippi river, but soon returned to\nSt. Louis. Learning that an officer\nwhom I afterwards found was Mr.\nPeel, was on my trail, I checked my\ngrip to Youngstown and beat ray\nway there on the trains. Checking\nmy grip through and receiving mail\nfinally led to my arrest,\n"Arriving in Youngstown I pro\ncured n position in the steel mills\nlast Wednesday, nnd although I\ncould hardly resist the temptation,\nI did not go to the post office to\nget the mail I was certain that was\nwaiting for me on Wednesday,\nThursday, or Friday. Saturday\nmorning I could stand it no longer.\nand thinking that the assumed\nname of Thomas Fisher would\nshield me, I went to the postoflice\nand asked for my mail. The clerk\nhesitated and looked at me when I\ngave my name, and I knew it was\nnil up. He told me to wait n min\nute, and came back a little later,\nsaying there was nothing for me.\n"When I went out I otieed\nplnin clothes men shadowing me,\nnnd knew that I wns about to be\narrested. So I went to n drug\nstore and asked for a glass of soda\nwater. As soon as I sat down I\nnoticed two policemen appear at\nthe front door, and then two more\nappealed at the side door. As soon\nns I finished tlie soda one of the\npolicemen came in and quitely tol I\nme I wns under arrest."\nDeafness Cannot Be Cured\nby local applications, as they can\nnot reach the diseased portion ot\ntho ear Thero is only ono way to\neuro deafness, and that is by con\nstitutional remedies.

Do you picture\na crowded court room packed\nwith backwoodsmen being held\nlo answer to charges of man\nslaughter and murder? Does it\nimpress you as being a tinu\nwhen the peace and quietude ol\nour little town will be disturbed\nby bootleggers and moonshiner?\nwho will peddle their wares at\nnight while justice is being\ndealt in the daytime? These\nand many other impressions no\ndoubt dominated you in yean\npast when the sessions of court\nivere announced and they were\nlooked forward to as being un\npleasent duties that had to be\nperformed perforce. That it\nancient history, so to speak, in\nthe County of Knox. No longer\ni murder, robbery and attend\nant evils present in our count\nin the numbers formerly record\ned. Seldom is there a case of\nbootlegging o r moonshining\nhoard of in the county, and tt\nthis was a large number of the\ncrimes formerly porpertrated\naccredited. This was one of the\nroots of evil which ha3 been de\nstroyed and this in a measure\naccounts for a part of the good\nbehavior of our citizens. Our\ncourts are no longer prolonged\nsessions of murder trials in\nwhich "bad men" are the princi\npal characters. Our county is\nalmost a model in this respect,\nand we doubt if there is another\ncounty in tho State that can\nboast the good record of her cit\nizens as does the good county ot\nKnox. Our courts have done\ntheir duty and those who were\nevilly inclined have learned to\nhave a good wholesome fear ct\ntho law. while those who under\nordinary circumstances wanted\nto do the right thing by their\nneighbors but who when they\ntook on a little too much "Swin\nkey" stirred things up and made\nit unpleasant, for those around\nthem have had the temptation\nremoved from them and conse\nquently have perceived the wU\ndoni in devoting their time to\nwaidsthe betterment of their\ncommunity and are better citi\nzens, living peaceably with\ntheir families. We are proud\nof our courts and our county of\nficers and proud of our good citi\nzens, for it was by the co-opera-tion\nof tho better men that the\nviolaters were brought to justice\nand dealt with in a manner that\nshowed that it was moro profit\nable from every standpoint to\nobey the law. There was one\nmurder charge to bo tried this\ncourt and that resulted in an ac\nquittal for the young man indict\ned. Very few crimiuial cases\nwere on the dorket and they\nwore not of a bad uature, and no\nother murder case.\nEver and anon we sen com\nment in our daily papers upoujjohn\nthe record of this or that court!\n--wfhich has sunt up a number of\nmen at its recont term ami tney\nro commended for their good\nwork. We are glad to see other1\ncounties ondaavoring to clean up\ntheir communitirs and no doubt\nit, is a source of gratification to I\nhear of a county that has beenjencein the workimr force of this\ntin tl:\n(Vast\n"Iter\nin the dangerous column for time\ntaking hold in earnest.\nere is more joy in Heaven\nver one sinner ini nuum\nJi nvor the ninety and nine\nLai )VeQ W rVpVnklatu,"\'\n\'SSSJU, iMHH\nr x . .-.\nProbably that, is the rea\'sen we\nrarely ever hear of our court re\ncords outsid o tlio county.\nAgain we ay wo aro proud\nthat wo live in such a good and\npcaceablo community. So let\nus all continuo to uphold our of\nficers and have tho "host county\nin the state."\nTHE GAME\nThe opening of the political\ngame will soon be upon us. Al\nready wo haviyhenrd the low\nrumbling of tho\' announcement\nthat "1 might bo a candidate\nnext fall." and from the post\notliccof Scalf whero our corres\npondent states that Mr. Thomas\nQ. Ilanimnns has assured uis\nfriends that he would he a can\ndidate for County Judge in the\ncoming primary election. The\nseason has been a bit backward\nthis spring owing to tho unset\ntled condition of politics all over\nthe country and candidates have\nnot been as forward in announ\ncing as previously, but once the\ngame is opened look for others\nto folh.w and there seems to be\nno danger but that there will be\nenough candidates offer them\nselves that our county ofliets\nwill not have to go begging dur\ning the next four years.\nGONSISTEINGY\nIt is amusing to note by the\nheadlines of the Mountain Echo,\nof London, that they are "UN\nSWERVING IN THEIR LOY\nALTY TO THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY." Probably it would\ncause a pang to remove this time\nhonored motto after it has stood\nfor the past forty years. No\ndoubt the present editor has\nthought to remove it many times\nsince he thought he saw the\ndawning of a new political party\non the horizen, but even then\nthe phrase would look awkward\nto read "A paper devoted to the\ninterest of the Kentucky Moun\ntains" were it not followed by\n"unswerving in its loyalty to the\nRepublican Party-" Let it\nstand BrotherStevenson \'though\nit is inconsistent with the edi\ntorials contained within, \'though\nit is merely a jargoing of mean\ningless words, \'though the pres\nent ownership repudiate the\ngrpat party that has helped d\nvolopand make these mountains\nof ours all that they are today.\nWo love the Echo for it was on\nthis that we learned our A,\' 13,\nO\'s years aeo and we want to\nthink of it for what it was uud\nits purpose years ago when tho\nRepublican party was yet iu its\ninfancy and was struggling for\nrecognition of the mountains and\nher people, when the odds were\nso overwhelming against us.\nThis is the Echo we love ; the\none that has taught us from our\ninfancy that all our great coun\ntry now is and all the recogni\ntion the mountain people now\nreceive, wo owe to the unceas\ning and untiring efforts of tho\ngood Republican statesmen who\nnreceeded us. Let us continue\nto think oj the Echo as being\nan instrument that helped us to\ngrow and develop into the great\nest section of the Commonwealth\nof Kentucky and helped build\nup this great party. Let us not\nthink of it as a disrupter and de\nstroyer of the great party o\'f OUR\npeople. Let us remember itonj\nly as "unswerving in its h.yalty\nto the Republican partj" and\nas u buileer, not destroyer.\nA Black Dank\nOfficers\nElects\nluesoay niicrnoon me mui-khuhi\nersol the Nniionul Hank ol John A,\nUlnck elected the same officers lor\nthe coming year ns those who have\nbeen serving in the past.

Lookout Mountain to the louth\nwest, Orchard Knob, within the city\nlimits, and Chlckamauga Park, twelve\nmiles BOiith, In Georgia, on the trolley\nline, were all scenes of conflict during\nthe great war between the itatee; and,\nno matter where the visitor Is from, he\nran And spots of Interest to visit\nplaces that will Interest him, on ac\ncount of associations participated In\nby soldiers from his part of the coun\ntry, whether north or south.

To visit this historic peak the\nvisitor takes the St. Elmo street car\nwhich carries him to the foot of the\nincline leading up the mountain. As\nto this Incline, It Is one of the most\nmodernly marvelous pieces of engi\nneering to be found anywhere la the\nUnited States and a trip up is well\nworth a visit to Chattanooga, At the\nbaso of the mountain Is the historic\ntown of St. Elmo, which wns the resi\ndence of Augusta Evans Wilson, while\nwriting the novel.

Ar\nriving at "the post," as It is familiarly\ncalled by Chattanooga, the visitor\nfinds good roads, kept up by the gov\nernment, running through the military\npari:, with Its broad acres and stately\nliiruuments, marking places where he\nmes of both the blue and the gray\npoured out their life\'s blood during\ntlmt dreadful conflict, when tho forces\nclinched In a deathly struggle that\nlasted several days.

Thu disciples knew of vnrlous\norders of beings on the aiiRcllc plane\ncherubim, seraphim nnd ordinary an\ngels. Jesus made no suggestion of\ncbnnglnK Ills disciples Into any of thco\nangelic orders. Kather, He gavo them\nto understand that they would consti\ntute a new order of creatures. The\nquestions then nnturnlv arose. Is there\na possibility of having a still different\norder of lielnKH on the Heavenly piano?\nDid not the creation of man a little\nlower thnu angels Imply a sufllclent va\nriety of creations on the angelic plane\nand higher?\nThese ipiestlous would seem, proper\nenough; nnd to tbeoe our Lord\'s words\nmake answer: "lli-ly Father\'s House\nare many manslonV\'-Timny apart\nments, many divisions. 1 all are.\nholj, all are In full accord wTttiJTIm\nand with each other "I ko to prefwre\na place for you," My followers\nHeavenly mntislon. ,\nSt. Peter, discussing tho subject, tells\nus that in God\'s providence the Chnrch\nIs not only a New Ci\'eatlon. hut a cre.i\ntlon on a higher plane than any other\nof God\'s creation. St. 1\'iuil .iys, that\nour Lord Jesus, having Mulshed the\nwork which the Father gave nitn to do,\n"ascended on High," to the right hand\nof the Divine Majesty, to the placo of\nchief favor. He declares Mint this po\nsltlon Is "far above angels, principali\nties und iowers and every mine that is\nrained."- r.pbeslans I, i!l.\nSt. John, shaking of the Church, de\nclares that we may not yet fully appre\nciate what we shall he, but we niay\n"know that, when lie shall appear\nour Itedeemerl, we shnll be like nim;\nfor wo shall see lllm ns He lj." (I John\nill, 2.) Ht. Peter, however, tells us the\nreal height to which the Church, the\nllildu of Clirlst, Is to he exalted. He\nsays, God hath given "unto us exceed\ning Kteat ami precious promises, that\nby these working In us His wlllj we\nmight become partakers of the HMnf\nnalurr"- II Peter t. s.\nThe Heavenly Three.\nFollowing the testimony tf the Word\nof God, we recognize Jehovah God\nHimself, from everlasting to everlast\ning God, the Head, the King, the Fa\nther, of whom ire all things. Next to\nthe Tuther we recognize our Heavoulj\nLord, whose name at first was the Lo\ngos, the Word of God. HI Messenger,\nwho subsequently was made lleh.\ndwelt among us and redeemed us; and\nho, as n reward, has been exulted to\nthe Divine nature and is set at the\nright hand of Jehovah God, to Ix\'gln\nHis work of blessing mankind, lie\nwaits also until the Church, His Itrlde,\nshall have been completed and shall\nhne passed beyond the veil, to be for\never with Him on the Divine plane,\nIII Jolut-hclr.\nThese are the Heavenly Three all\nof the Dhlue Nature, far above all\nother natures, all other planes of ex\nistence. Yet always we are to re\nmember that the Head of the Church\nIs Christ, und the Head of Christ is\nGod, us St. Paul declares: for although\nall of God\'s blessings are by the Sou.\nyet those blessings are all from the\nFather. I Corinthians Till, 0.\nIn passing, we should note how\nthese Scripture and all the Scripture\ncontinually show that the Heavenly\nFather was not Ills own Sou and that\nthe Heavenly Son was uot His own\nFather. In our text the Master de\nclares, "In My Father\'s House are\nmany mansions." Jesus, the chief Son,\nhas special privileges and special pow\ner; and it Is by the Father\'s arrange\nment that the Itrlde, the Lamb\'s Wife,\nIs to Ik- brought Into the highest of\nHeavenly mansions, the Divine na\nture, to be Joint-heir with her Lord In\nHis Mcsshinlc reign and In His ever\nlasting glory thereafter.\n"I Go to Prepare a Place."\nHut why did Jesus need to go to pre\npare a place? Ills disciples did not\nwish lllm to go and leave them. When\never He spoke along tills line they\nwere grieved und perplexed; and on\none occasion St. Peter brought upon\nhimself a special rebuke by saying.\n"He It fur from Thee, Lord: these\nthings shall not happen unto Thee."\nThe disciples weie like children. They\nhad absolute confidence that they were\nto shale with Messiah the gloiles of\nIlls Messianic Kingdom. They won\nilensl why Jesus did not stay with\nthem and attend to the establishment\nf the Kingdom at that time; or If It\nwore necessary to wait for it season,\nwhy He might imt lurry with them\nInstead of going to the Futher, as He\nhad often told them that He vvould do.\nOur l.otd did not wish to give them\nany Intimation respecting the length of\nthe Cuspo! Age, lest tho knowledge\nshould dlirouritgo them. Therefore He\niaerely said. "It Is exiedlcut for you\nthat I go a way" -necessary for you\nI\'nlcss He should gt away, the Holy\np!i It would not c-oiuu upon them. They\ntvoiild not receive that ower from on\nHigh, of which He had told them,\nwhich they saw exemplified lu II I in,\nand which they experienced when He\nput Ills power tiioii them aud Hunt\nthem forth us Ills representatives to\nwork miracles and to proclaim the Gos\npel of the Kingdom.\nAfter 1\'entecont. wbuu enlightened by\n(lie Holy Spirit, they could understand\nU fWftMlty f9t JwuV ItHvtof o4 fer\ntfSSeSr\nHt tiMiKMr\' DptrH Vettlnff\nto Um MMm \' Mfcire.

He Imputed to us before the\nFather the merit of Ills own sncrince.\nand proposed to adopt us,ns His mem\nbers. Then Dlvlno Justice-accepted the\nAdvocatea proposal, nnd that mennt\nthe acceptance of our proffered sncrl\nllces, as the members of Jesus.\nTen dnjs after our Lord left Ills\nApostles, tho Pcntecostnl blessing\ncame upon them. St Peter explnlns\'-,\nthat It was tho Heavenly Father\'s rec, -ognltlou\nof HLs ncccptnnco of tho fol-\nlowers of Jesus who were entering Into\ncovenant, relationship through Hlra by\nthe covenant of sclf-sncrlflcc. The\ntransaction Involved all subsequent\nmembers of the Household of Faith to\ntho end of this Age- As n result, the\nHoly Spirit enmo upon tho consecrated,\nThey were to bn made children of God; ,\nnnd "If children, then heirs, heirs of\nGod and Joint-heirs with Christ, our\nLont.df so be that wc suffer with Him.\nthat we- may be also glorlllcd together."\nItonjMisMill, 17.\nGrowth In Grace.\nMistakenly. In the past, many of us.\nhavo supposed Justification to lie the 4 ,\ngoal of the Christian merely me ior\nglWne8R of sins. Now we see that\nMilsNyu a great mistake. Now we\nsee ths.\'e.Jiist Ideation by faith is only\na stcpplns.tonc to snnctiflcatlon-tho\nbegetting of"tbi Ilply Spirit ns New\nTren fores In Christ. Nsilorcover, WC\nsee that eveu-our sanctlflcntion byfkc\ni begetting of the Holy Spirit is not\nsufllclent, nor our goal.\nThe Splrlt-bcgottcn ones must grow\nIn grace, in knowledge. In all the fruits\nand graces of the Holy Spirit. They\nmust lie tested and proved as to their\nloyalty and fntthfulness. Fiery trials,\ntestings, tribulations, must be allowed\nto come against them to prove tlio\ndepth and sincerity of their love for\nGod. Crnelily. their testings nre\nnot nloug the lines of the llesh. which\nIs acknovhslgeil to lie Imperfect, weak,\nnnd which Is acceptable us a sacrifice\nonly through the merit of Jesus. Their\ntestings and acceptance are according\nto their niiiid. their will, as New Crea\ntures hi Christ\ni Will Come Again."\nThe .Master would be absent during\nthe period of the selection of tho Ilrldo\nclass In Heaven itself. Yet by His\nSpirit or Power, the Holy Spirit, which\nis also the Spirit or Power of the\nFather, lie would have full knowl\nedge of ull tho nffalrs of His people\na i hi would providentially make "all\nthings wor\'c together for good to them\nthat love Him." Suffer they must; en\ndure. trials and testings they must, in\norder to prove their loyalty even unto\ndeath; but nis grace vvould be suf\nllclent for them, and His strength\nwould lie made perfect hi their weak\nnesse: and He would never leave\nthem, lu the sense of abandoning\nthem. So long as they would abide\nlu lllm by faith and by loyalty of\nheart-Intention, He would overrule all\nthings for their good.\nAfter the selection of the full num\nber of the ltrldu clnss, He would como\nngnbi to receive them unto Himself.\nne would come relatively In the same\nsense in which He went away. In the\nsense In which Ho has not been pres\nent throughout the Age. Ho would\ncome In the sense of taking charge of\nthe affairs of tho world. He will tnko\nto Himself His greut Power nnd begin\nIlls reign. His tlrst kingly ofllco will\nle hi respect to Ills Church. Ho will\ncull Ills own servants nnd reckon with\nthem tlrst. Ho will reward the folth\nf til by allowing the unfaithful to pass\nInto tribulation with the world.\nAs Satan has for a long time been\n"the prluco of the iwwor of the air,"\n"the prince of this world," so Messiah,\nafter binding Sntau for n thousand\nyenrs, will assume His rightful title\nns the King of this world, the King of\nGlor;. His Power will also be the\n"Power or the Air." or a spirit power;\nbut, unlike that of Satan, It will be it\nHoly Spirit power. Ills saints will bo\ncalled awuy with lllm, to share IPs\nThrone and Umpire, "the Power of\nthe Air," Ills Spiritual Kingdom.\nThus the Ilrldo of Christ will bo\ncompleted, vvjien tho foreordained\nnumber of the Klect shall have been\nfound and proved worthy by trials\nand testings, and shall have gone be\nyond the veil. Then tho glorious King\ndom of Messiah will begin its work\nfor mankind, restoring und blessing,\nvery much as Israel had understood\nnnd as all tho Holy Prophets had ex\nplained. Describing the coming bless\nings, which will begin with Natural\nIsrael und extend to nil people. St.\nPeter says, "Times of refreshing shall\ncome from tho presence of the Lord:\nand lie shall send Jesus Christ, which\nbefore was preached unto you, whom\ntho Heavens must retain until the\nTimes of Restitution of all things,\nwhich God bath spoken by the mouth\nof all tho Holy Prophets since the\nworld began."-AcU Hi, 10-21.\nI exhort you, brethren, lu the words\nof tho Apoutle Paul, "Let us fenr, lest\ni promise belug left us of entering\nInto His rest, any of us should seem\nto come short" (Hebrews I v. II. If wo\nliuvo been begotten by tho Holy Spirit,\nlet us walk lu harmony therewith. Let\nus endure faithfully tho necessary\ntrials aud discipline, that wo may lie\nperfect aud entire, lacking nothing.\n"For If ye do these things, yo shall\noever fall; for no au eiitrnnco shall be\nministered unto yon abundantly.
