The spirit of his address\nwas friendship for the Mexican peo\nple, but extreme pessimism as to tho\noutlook for Immediate restoration of\npence, because ot President Huerta\'s\nrejection of the mediation plan.\nThe Message In Part.\nIn part, the president said;\n"It is clearly my duty to lay he\nforo you fully, very fully, anil without\nreservation, the facts concerning our\npresent relations with tho republic of\nMexico, Tho deplorublo posture of af\nfairs In Mexico I need not describe,\nbut I deem it my duty to apeak very\nfrankly what this government hus\ndone and should seek to do In fulfill\nment of its obligations to Mexico her\nself, ae a friend and neighbor, and to\ntho American citizens whose lives aud\nvital Interests are dally affected by\nthe distressing conditions which now\nobtain beyond our southern border.\n"Meanwhile, what Is it our duty to\ndo? Clearly, everything that we must\ndo must bo rooted in patience and\ndono with calm and disinterested de\nliberation. Impatience on our parr\nwould be childish and would be\nfraught with every risk ot wrong and\nfolly.\n"Wo can afford to exercise the self\nrestraint of, a really great nation\nwhich realizes its own strength and\nscorns to uso It It was our duty to\noffer our actlvo assistance.\nI "It Is now our duty to show what\n\' 1- , - 1 1 Ill .1,, , ....nl.lr.\nli im jiuuuiuuj ni iiu iu u.HiiiM- Dis\npeople of Mexico to sot their aflulrs in\norder again and wait for i further op\npdrtuntty to offer our friendly coun\nsels.

"We should let everyone who as\nsumes to exorcibe authority In any\npart of Mexico know in tho most un\nequivocal way that wo shall vigilantly\nwatch the fortunes of those Ameri\ncans who cannot get away and shall\nhold thoso responsible for their suffer\nings and losses to a definite reckon\ning. That enn bo and will be made\nplain beyond a possibility of a misun\nderstanding.

Only so can It be peaceful or\nfruitful of the benefits of peace, Mex\nico has a great and enviable future\nbefore her If only sbo choose and at\ntain the paths of honest constitution\nal government."\nHero the president gave a word pic\nture of condition!) in Mexico today:\n"Tho present circumstances of tho\nrepublic," he said, "1 deeply regret to\nsay, do not seem to promise oven the\nfoundations of such peace. Wo havo\nwaited many months, months full of\nperil and anxiety, for tho conditions\nthere to improve, and they havo not\nImproved. Tlioy havo grown worao,\nrather. Tho territory In some sort\ncontrolled by tho provisional authori\nties at Mexico City has grown smaller,\nnot larger.

Wnr and\ndisorder, devastation and confusion\nseem to threaten to become thu set\ntled fortune of the distracted country.\nAs friends we could wait no longer for\na solution which every week seemed\nfurther away. It was our duty to at\nleast volunteer our good offices- to\noffer to assist if we might In effecting\nsome arrangement which would bring\nthe rcliof and peace and set up a uni\nversally acknowledged politlcnl au\nthority there."\nTho president then said ho "took\nthu liberty" of sending John Llnd to\nMexico as his personal spokesman\nand representative.

We cannot thrust\nour good offers upon them. The situa\ntion must bo given a little time to\nwork Itself out In tho now circum\nstances; and I believe that\'only a lit\ntle while will bo necessary. For tho\ncircumstances are now. The rejection\nof our friendship makes them now\nand will Inevitably bring its own al\nterations in the whole aspect of af\nfairs. The actual situation of tho au\nthorities at Mexico City will presently\nbo revealed."\nThe president concluded:\n"I- am happy to say that soveral of\ntho great governments of the world\nhave given this government their gen\nerous moral support In urging upon\ntho" provisional authorities tho accept\nance of our proffered good offices in\nthe spirit in which they were mado.\nAt the world expects us to\nact as Mexico\'s nearest friend and\nintimate adviser.

Negotiations for tho friendly media\ntion of tho United States are open to\nresumption nt any tlmo upon cither\nthe Initiative of this govcrnuoiit or\nof Mexico.\nMexico Submitted Counter Proposal.\nAccompanying tho president\'s nd;\ndress Was tho reply of tho Huerta gov\nernment rejecting tho Amorlcun pro\nposals. It was written by Foreign\nMinister CI tun boa. It suggested the\nfollowing nltemutivn\' "policy Car the\nUnited States:\nReception of a Mexlean ainVosfetulor\nIn Washington. .\nThat tho United States send a new\nambassador to Mexico wlthent re\nstraints. Strict observation of tho neutrality\nlaws and "seo to It that no material\nor monotnry assistance Is given to the\nrebels."\nUnconditional recognition of tho\nllucrtu government.\nTho occasion had not been parall\neled in moro than it century. No\nothor president slnco Georgo Wash\nington has appeared before congress\non a foreign affair. Tho Bcnnto an J\nhouse assembled in tho honso cham\nber, the senators filing in two by two.\nAs tho president mounted tho plat\nform, whero Speaker Clark nnd Vice\nPresident Marshall wore waiting, tho\nbig chamber was hushed. Attlrod In\na conventional frock coat suit, tho\npresident stood nt the clerk\'s desk\nand read his address in the eaay con\nversational tono for which ho In noted.\nScarcely a sound interrupted.\' ,\nU. 4. Could Walt No Longer.\nDescribing Mexican conditions and\ntho events that led up to tho negotia\ntions just concluded, Presidceut Wil\nson outlined how "war and disorder,\ndevastation nnd confusion, Nccin to\nthreaten to becomo tho nottled fot\ntuno of tho distracted country." Ab\nfriends, ho said, this country could\nwait no longer for a solution of tklngs\niu the sister republic.\nPresident Wilson read his instruc\ntions to John Llnd.\n"All America cries out for a Bettle\nment," read tjio noto Llnd bore to\'\nMexico.\nTho president emphatically praised\ntho execution of IiIb mission by Mr. \'\nLlnd, and said he Was led to believe\ntho Huerta government rejected the\nAmerican proposals "because the au\nthorities at Moxlco City had been\ngrossly misinformed and misled," up\non the spirit of tho American people\nIn the mntter, "and upon a mistaken\nbelief thnt tho present administration\ndid not speak for tho people of the\nUnited States." So long as such ,i\nmisunderstanding continued, tho presi\ndent nsserted thnt this nation "could\nonly await tho time of their aweken\ning to a realization of tho realisation\nof the real facts."\n"Tho situation," ho declaroi), "must\nbe given a little more time to work\nItself out In the now clrcnmBtances,"\nHo then outlined the position tills\ngovernment should take. Concluding\nhis address, the president predicted\nthat tho "steady pressuro of moral\nforce will beforo many days break tho\nbarriers of pride and prejudico down\nand we shall triumph ns Moxlco\'s\nfriends sooner thau we eonld triumph\nas her enemies."\nThe Situation In Mexico.\nWashington, D. C. Strong hop\nprevnlled In official circles that the\nHucrtu government nnd the United\nStntes soon would arrive nt an un\nderstanding leading to a peaceful Bet\ntlcmcnt of tho revolutionary disturb\nances iu Mexico.\nThis is the Mexican sltuntlou in\nbrief:\nHuertn has withdrawn his request\nfor an exchange of nmbasBadors and\nasked that tho present diplomatic\nstatus continue until after Mexican\nelections in October. Dy somo that\nwas Interpreted nB n concession.\nA request for recognition ns "tho\nconstitutional government ad Interim,"\nwhich was coupled with tho proposal\nfor nn exchange of ambassadors was,\nhowever, Interpreted by many official\nas a practical reiteration of tho orig\ninal stnnd of tho Huerta government.\nLlnd Ordered to Return.\nSenoar Gamboa, Mexican minister\nof foreign affairs, pointed out that tho\ndomnnd of tho United States for the\nelimination of Huertn Is met by a pro\nvis on of tho Mexican constitution,\nwhich mnkea a provisional president\nIneligible to re-election. Tho "Tfaah\nIngton government, however, diwirea\nassurances moro defiulte.\nJohn Llnd, President Wilson\'s en\nvoy, was authorized to return to Mox\nlco City from Vera Cruz, "if, In his\ndiscretion, it seemed advisable." It\nIb belloved that negotiations over\nsomo ot tho disputed points, princi\npally tho retirement of Huertn, ny\nbo reopened.\nPresident Wilson und Secretary\nllryau regnrdod the sltuntlou nti "en\ncouraging" and Indicated they expect\ned soma change In tho nttltudu nt\nMexico City after tho president\'s ad\ndress beforo congress was digested.\nAmerican consular officers through\nout Mexico wore rounding up Amerl\ncnns, advising them to leave Mt,\'ilcc-j ,\nund proparlns means to aidtnem fa\ndoing bo. \'', 'f.\nTHE FAIR PLAY.\n\'rtATOtuuv, Ht?rTHMnEH,ni3.\nB.V MAIL lit ADVANCtM\'OHTAOn PUKl\'AID\nONK YPMUtiialdn County) . . .

Wheat that had been\nseeded in May wna already ripening,\nand had a stand fully as good as any\ncountry had over produced; tho heads\nwuro largo and tho prospects wero of\nWheatfletd Ih Stook,\ntho brightest. It was not only In\nwheat but in flax, oats and barley, tho\nFnmo splendid conditions obtained.\nIlains In all parts of tho country came\nat tlio right tlmo and tho best of\nweather throughout tho season pre\nvailed In all parts.\nTho hay crop was excellent. Al\nfalfa, clovor and timothy Brasses wero\ngood, nnd many farmers aro now cul\ntivating these splendid fodders.\nTho homestead shack Is giving plnco\nto comfortable residences.

Fields are fenced, roads con\nstructed and great Holds of grain and\npasture land aro always In evidence.\nFor a Mlnuve He Was Conciliatory.\nThis storj Is told b an old miner\njust returnul from Alaska: "Mlko\nand I were prospecting far away from\ncamp when night oertook us. We\ndecided on a short cut. Wo camo to\na canyon deep nnd narrow, anil nfter\nsome delay wo found a fallen tree\nacruss the canyon. Mlko stepped\nboldly on nnd started to cross. The\nhark sealed, almost causing him to\nfall. He mado another attempt; ho\ngingerly picked his way. muttering as\nho went: \'Sure and Clod\'s good, sure\nand Cod\'s good, nnd tho devil ain\'t\na bail fellow at all, at all." He re\npeated this until safely on tho other\nside, where ho turned and shaking\nhis list nt somo Imaginary foe ex\nclaimed: \'Aw! g\'wiin wld thu\nboth of yez.\' " Kansas City Star.\nBouncing Arrival Was a Baby.\nThere wns a stork parly in Atchison\nrecently, nnd tho husband was in thu\nroom when hla first baby was bom\nlie suddenly rushed front It and down-stal-"\nto whero several persons wero\nwaiting tr bear tho nows.

In\nthe decade. Tho wheat nren of 10 1 1\nui greater than that of 1010 by;i3t,IGl\nacres. Thoro aro Increases In the area\nof production of nil cereals for 1010\nover 1000, excepting peas\' and mixed\ngrains.\nOf cereals grown In 1010 the largest\ngross monetary roturn per aero was\ngiven by peas with $20.51, followed by\nbeans with JIG,!", fall wheat with\n$15.07. corn for husking with f 12.113,\nllax $11.15, buckwheat $11.06, spring\nwheat $10.31. The smullest roturns\nworo obtained from oats, rye and bar-\nkloy In the order named.\nTho average value per farm Homing\nof Held crops\nvegetables and fruit ,\nCanada Are of the Best.\nwas $1,024.71 In 1910, as against\n$518.03 In 1900, being an increase of\n79.18 per cent. In tho decade.\nComing back to tho crops of 1913, It\nmay safely be said that tho yield of\nwheat In Saskatchewan will be about\n115,000,000 bushels, with an average\nyield of over 22 bushels per acre.\nOats, which ure but a fair crop, will\nyield an average- equal to that of last\nyear. Darloy Is excellent, while llax,\nof which tho average is considerably\nless than last year, will produco .t\ngreater averago than for years. What\nIs said of these crops will apply to all\ndistricts.\nUnder dato of August 12th, a report\ncomes from Itegina which says:\n"Unless some dtro calamity occurs\nin tho next fow days farmers of the\nItegina district will reap the greatest\nwheat crop ever recorded In tho West.\n"A correspondent, made an automo\nbllo trip to tho north and west of tho\ncity, over twe\'nty-sevon miles being\ncovered. Several fields were seen\nWestern Canada.\nwhich were almost rlpo enough for the\nbinder. Others require about a weok\nmoro warm wenthor, but everywhere\nwas tho indication of a phenomenal\nyield. Oats do not nverago up with\ntho wheat, but several good fields wero\nseen. This time next weok the hum\nof tho binder should be tho prevalent\nmusic around Itegina.\n"One farm was passed on which\nthero was ono squaro mllo of tho finest\nwheat Imaginable. It Is Just turning\nyellow and will run forty bushels to\ntho acre."\nIn Alberta thero will bo a high\nyield ot all grains. Wheat will bo a\nheavier average than last year.

Unobtrusive as they are,\nthey lay the farmer under a heavy\ndebt of gratitude by their food habits,\nstneo their chosen fare consists large\nly of the seeds of the weeds. Selecting i\nu typical member of the group, the\ntree sparrow for Instance, one-fourth\nounco of weed seed per day Is a eon- J\nsorvatlve estimate of tho food of an i\nadult. On this basis, In u large ngrlcul-1\nturnl stato like Iowa tree sparrows an-1\nnunlly eat annroxlmatelv 875 tons of \'\nweed reed. ,\nSomo Idea of tho money value of .\ni this group of birds to the country may ,\nt be gained from the statement that the j\nI total value of the farm products In the \'\n\' United States In 1910 reached tho\n\' amazing sum of $8,020,000,000. If we 1\nestimate that the total consumption of\n, weed seed by the combined members\nof tho sparrow family resulted in ti\nsaving of only ouo per cent, of tho\ncrops not n violent assumption tho\nsum saved to fnrmers by these birds\nIn 1910was $89,260,000.\nDREW THE LINE AT SPURS\nOne Thing Frederic Remington Insist\ned on While Undergoing Medi\ncal Treatment,\nAugustus Thomas, In his recollec\ntions of Frederic Romlngtou, relates\nthe following: "Ono Sunday morning\nIn thoso later dayB I went with him\nto tho olllcc of an osteopathic physi\ncian who was treating him. The os\nteopath was a slight man and not tall.\nRemington, lying face downward on\ntlio operating table, presented a sky\nlino so much higher thnn that of the\naverage patient that tho- doctor stand\ning on tho floor lacked the angle of\npressure necessary to his treatment.\nThe doctor, therefore, mounted n\nchair, from which ho. stepped to the\ntable, and finally sat astride of Rem\nington, applying his full weight to the\nmanipulation which he wns giving to\ntho spinal column. \'I hope I\'m not hurt\ning you, Mr. Remington?\' said tho doc\ntor. Remington answered, \'It\'s all\nright, doctor, as long as you don\'t UBe\nyour Bpurs.\' "\nAppeal Sustained.\nA mouse being chnsed by a cat In\nMr. Joo\'s brewery, fell Into a vat of\nbeer. The cat sprang to the edgo of\nthe vat and called: "Aha, Mrs.\nMouse, you hail better havo let mo eat\nyou thnn to drown."\n"Yes," ropllcd tho mouse, "If you\nwill save mo from this, you may eat\nme." ,\nTlio cat went to tlio edgo of the\ntank and extended his paw, and tho\nmouse landed and ran hastily into its\nhole.\n"Como out," demanded tho augry\ncat, "redeem your promise, and lot me\ndevour you."\n"Oh, no," eald the mouse, "when 1\nmade It I was in liquor."\nHis Fatal Error.\n"Well, Wlldboys has himself to\nthank for his troubles.
