It was a reunion of Christian people, and\nmany old soldiers of the Cress lived life ever\nagain In recounting te each ether reminiscences\nof ether pastoral days. It was a happy re\nunion of old friends and pleasant introduction\nte each ether of persons who had never met\nbefore. There were many delightful surprises\nin the sudden and unexpected meeting of for\nmer acquaintances and of persons one knew all\nabout but had never seen. N\nThe weather smiled lovely upon the Conven\ntion, and everything that had been planned and\nhoped for came off without hindrance or disap\npointment. The hearty welcome in the homes\nwhere delegates vsere entertained as guests\nwas felt and appreciated by them, and they re\nturned te their homes feeling that it was geed\nte be in Maysville.\nThe Convention showed its high appreciation\nof a geed man and indirectly complimented his\nhome town, in which they had been royally re\nceived and cared for, when it by acclamation\nelecteJ Mr. James T. Kackley President of the\nSunday-schools of the state for the ensuing\nyear te succeed the retiring President, Attorney\nEd S. Jouett of Winchester.\nThis was a well deserved recognition of Mr.\nKacklea faithful services as a Sunday-school\nworker and advocate, and we predict that the\nSunday-schools of Kentucky will greatly flourish\nunder bis administration.\nRichmond was selected as the place where\nthe Convention will meet next year.\nThe delegates threw many bouquets te and\nsaid many approving things of the local man\nagement by the local congregation of this Con\nvention. The Richmond delegates will likely tell their\nChurch hew Maysville managed this Convention.\nOne feature of this Convention was the\ndining-room basement in which dinner was\nserved gratuitueusly te nearly one thousand\npeople daily during the Convention. The tables\nand the room with the decorations of cedar,\nfern and flower presented a beautiful scene\nthat will always be remembered. The "Mays\nlick Day," the "County Day" and the "Mays\nville Day" in which each in turn vied with the\nether in hospitable entertainment of delegates\nand visitors, was a happy solution of the dinner\nquestion.\nThe Convention closed with program in the\nOpera-house last night. J. W. Graham of\nLouisville presented in forceful manner the\nclaims of the Christian Church Orphan Heme\nupon the charity of the Church. He mentioned\nwith pride the fact that the Foreign Christian\nMissionary Society, the Christian Orphans Heme\nand the Masonic Heme were net only pioneer\ninstitutions but best of all were born en Ken\ntucky soil and were models for ether states and\ncountries te go by In establishing similar insti\ntutions. Dr. Herbert L. Willett of the Chicago Uni\nversity arrived in Maysville in time te deliver\nhis admirable address at the Opera-heuse en\n"The Church as a Teacher." The audience\ngreeted his appearance warmly and gave hla\nspeech the closest attention. Dr. Willett is a\nman of culture, learning and eloquence and his\nsplendid talk was much appreciated and com\npllmented.\nThe State Sunday-school Convention elected\nthe following officers for ensuing year\nPresident James T.

This desire took public \'\nexpression ns fellows\nFrem The Dever Public Messenger.\nAt today\'s Republican County Convention at Maysville\nEditor Themas A, Davis is tipped for the nomination\nfor Representative in the Lewer Heuse of the General As\nsembly. While Editor Davis is an active and courageous\npartisan, he is first a brainy, brend, liberal and patriotic\nAmerican citizen, who sees\' the magnificent future possi\nbilities of his native Kentucky, and is ever ready with\nvoice and peu te hurry up the work of development. Dis\nparaging net the claims of ether candidates, we are honest\nin saying and believing that should Mr, Davis be elected\nhe is certain te win the highest praise in the State Legis\nlature and te advance the interests of Masen county\nalong the lines of natural and prompt development\nthrough practical statesmanship.\nTHE LIVER QUARANTINE\nT\'ether day I heard a discussion in a- large\nEastern city as te whether we\'d knew each\nOther in Heaven; and I couldn\'t help thinking\nwhat useless speculation it was, inasmuch as the\npeople of that city didn\'t new knew their next next next\ndeer neighbors.\nFrem The Louisville Herald.\nRepublican nominations for the Legislature se far give\nhope of better conditions in the Legislature than have for\na long time prevailed. The Republicans of Masen county\nspeak, we are happy te note, of placing the Hen. Themas\nA. Davis, Editor of The May.svim.e Public Ledekr, in\nnomination for Representative from their opulent and in\ntelligent county. Ne better choice could made. A united\neffort en the part of the Republicans of Ma6en ought te\nland Mr. Davis in the General Assembly, where he wuld\ncertainly prove a power for party geed and sound legisla\ntion. Well, the Convention met and my name was\npresented by Colonel C. C. Dkgman. Very\npromptly another was proposed, when Coleuel\nDegman did me the favor of withdrawing my\nname.\nI would much rather have the regard of my\nbrethren of the Press than te have the doubtful\nhonor of an empty nomination ; for 1 am told\nthat the Chairman of the Convention, in urging\ncandidates te accept places en the ticket, fissured\nthem that they would "net be burdened with\nthe office!"\'\nSe it leeks quite like the nominees were\nsimply put up te be knocked down a sort of\nAnnex te Democratic Success.\nIf I\'m wrong, I\'m misled by the Chairman\'s\ninconsiderate declaration.\nifpKtfjwX ksK if\n"TAKING HIS MEALS OUT."\nQHurricd eating lias ruined many a man\'s\nstomach.

One day it\nwould scab ever and then crack open\nand a watery matter ooze from it and\nthe scabs would all fall off. It would\nbe raw for a time, then scab ever\nagain. Seme one recommended Cuti\ncura, and we immediately procured\na box of Cuticura Ointment, and a cake\nof Cuticura Seap. She was much bet\nter after the first bath with warm water\nand soap, and an application of the\nOintment. Before it was half gene we\nsaw a marked change for the better,\nand she was entirely cured, without a\nscar being left, by the one box of Oint\nment and one cake of Seap.

A single appli\ncation of Cuticura Ointment, preceded\nby a warm bath with Cuticura Seap,\ngives instant relief, and refreshing\nleep for skin-tortured babies, and\nrest for tired, fretted mothers.\nCuticura fletp, Olntmmt, ind mil art told throughout\nth world.
