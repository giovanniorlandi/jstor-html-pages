This sum represented his Income for about the time he was being\nnerved, the merest trifle out of his day.\nIn this unoccupied interval he glanced at the table and equipment and\nennrossed himself with speculation as to the cost of providing him with\nhis Blmple repast, were all the preparations for himself alone,\nThere was the table. The texture of the wood evidenced that It was of\n" "MuuiiKiure, iiib luinoermen in a winter camp could be seen\nthrough the eye of imagination, sturdy fellows felling the trees, floating them\nin a turbulent stream to the mill, risking their lives in breaking jams, boldly\nriding the logs through the rapids, with the picaroon on the alert to sheer\naway from the banks of midstream obstacles.\nThen he saw the liiill where the ruthleBs saws cut their way. through\nthe heart of the sectioned trees; afterwards the factory with Its hosts of em\nployes, lathing, sawing, polishing, joining, staining, packing. Afterwards\nthe great storeroom, where for a time the table reposed with thousands of\nhis kind, each to depart to a different destination, each to be surrounded by\neither the men who eat to live or those who live to eat.\nThe business man felt of the texture of the tablecloth. He found it to\nbe imported linen, for his business made him a Judge of such material. Then\nhe saw in his mind\'s eye the fields of flax, the spinning Jenny, the weaving\nworks, each with their armies of workers. Then the flax, which had crossed\nthe sea, returned in finished form. It was trucked about in bolts and sold In\nretail by weary sales girls. It traveled many thousands of miles and passed\nthrough hundreds of hands, each entitled to daily recompense, before It found\nIts way to the grill.\nas to me roiK wnicn he idly drummed against the knife. Outwardly\nthey were Bilver and perhaps some of it came from the depths beneath Tono\npah, where men toil in the earth heat, their lungs fed with air pumps from\nthe far distant surface. Hut under the Bilver surface there is a base metal\nfilling and it was prepared through the exercise of the most ponderous piece\nof machinery in the history of the world, the billion dollar trust, unless, per\nchance, it was supplied by one of the small rival concerns. At all events it\nrepresents tne sweat of the face, the weariness of the limbs, the investment\nof colloasal treasure.\nThe business man glanced casually at the sugar from the Indies, "the salt\nthat was crystallized from th" hrlne drawn from the depths of the earth, the\npepper from some topic isle, the this and the that, the these and the those, all\ngarnered in labor and sometimes peril, but always at cost, from the earth\'s\nremotest bounds.\nin reverie enuea wnen "rrencny" arrived with the coffee and rolls, for\nwhich he rather grudgingly paid a coin so small that he would scorn to place\nit In the contribution box at church\nBATTLE-SHIPS AND RPE PA REDNESS\nANOTHER British battle-ship has gone to the bottom, a submerged mine\nbeing the cause of her undoing another weapon of offense destroyed\nby an instrument of defense, says the Chronicle.\nThere is a lesson In the loss of this enormous floating battery, as in the\nloss bjc similar means of every other warship. It points to the folly and possi\nbility of something worse in the preparedness agitation when that agitation\nis coupled with a demand for the building of more battle-ships.\n. If preparedness is honestly for derense and not for defiance, It will de\nmand more forts and fortifications, more mines and all other essentially de\nfensive weapons, and be silent on the subject of constructing the means for\naggression.\nThe oceans yawn between us and any possible foes. We do not want to\ncross their waters to make an attack; it will be sufficient if we are prepared\nagainst an attack by others. If we plan to meet battle-ships with battle-ships\nwe will need an Atlantic and a Pacific navy each equal to any possible emer\ngency. The moment Europe or Asia adds a mile to the range of her guns, or\na knot to the speed of her vessels we miiHt do likewise. On the other hand,\nIf we rely upon the superiority of land over water batteries, and the superior\nity of mines over dreadnaughts we can be sure of a defense which Is not\nonly more economical, but which proclaims to all the world that we are a\npeace-loving people with no intention of foreign aggression.\nWhen preparedness goes beyond defense, it is preparedness for war and\nnot against it. The test of sincerity in the present campaign is whether the\nadvocates want purely defensive weapons of those which can also be used\noffensively. The former need be no heavy tax upon the people, the latter may\neasily become a burden reducing America to the grinding poverty of European\nnations.\nMoreover, a string of mines around our coasts will not excite the rest of\nthe world to increase its armaments. Such a policy would be rather Incite\nment to the preservation of peace. On the other hand, a string of battle-ships\nwould be a challenge and a step away from that arbitration and conciliation\nideal which it is our privilege to hold up to the nations,\nA bunch of the boys were whoop\ning it up, woman fashion, around the\nwhist table in the Mlzpah Hill club\na night or two ago until a partner\'s\nace was trumped, when general con\nversation was made taboo and each\nwas permitted his say uninterrupted.\nCrossing his legs, so that the three\nbuckles the expert\'s coat of arms\nwere In plain view, one high booted\ndoctor of ores essayed as follows:\n"The reminiscences you fellows\nhave been dishing up while you were\nreniging and asking what was trump\nhave not dealt with the Tonopah Ex\ntension, so far as I have been able\nto hear in this babel of conversation.\nDo you know, boys, that this is the\nlast shift in the No. 1?

A remedy which\nconsisted only of criminal law forbidding unfair competition would invite the\nforeigner to Invade our markets, because the dealer would be free from pen\nalty unless it could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he had know\ningly and deliberately vloWled the law. The presumption of innocence, as\nin the case of all criminal statutes, would be on the side of the defendant,\nInstead of establishing a presumption in favor of the American producer. A\nlaw attempting lo control unfair competition through criminal statutes would\ngive the foreign producer a decided advantage.\nAmerican Industries were built up under a protective tariff system. In\ntwo Instances within the memory of this generation American industries have\nbeen practically ruined by the enactment of tariff-for-revenue-only laws. These\nare condltlous.

Get out of that\nrathole.\' But it was home for the old\nprospector and in it were his Lares\nand Penates, meager as they were.\n. "The colonel gave some directions\nto the \'super\' and the next day the\ndump rails were deflected and Mr.\nLockhart heard the waste rattling\ndown In front of his very door.

The following Htory of the Twenty\nFirst FlyiiiR Column of the First Si\nberian corps wan related by Andrew\nKalpaschnlkoff, former Hecretary of\nthe RuHHian embassy at Washington,\nKalpaschnikoff offered his service to\nhis country at the outbreak of the\nwar and was assigned to service with\nthe Red Cross. He became identified\nwith the 21st Flying Column and soon\nwas placed in command of that body.\n"The reckless daring of the First Si\nberian corps," said Kalpaschnikoff, "is\nwell known throughout Russia. The\nflying column attached to such a\nfighting organization has no easy\ntusk. In the firm days of the war\nseveral columns, attracted by the bril\nliant achievements of that corps in the\ndefence of Warsaw, strove for the hon\nor of working with It, and especially\nwith the famous first division; but\nthey found the work too hard, or the\nconditions too dnngerous, and after\nbrief periods abandoned the task.\nThe Twenty-First Flying Column\nwhich had been with the corps since\nthe end of November, 1914, has prov\nen Its worth. It was organized at the\nexpense of a rich patroness, Countess\nTolstoy, already famed for the work\nshe has done in the founding of the\nhospitals and feeding points for the\nsick and wounded. Early in October\nit did Its first work with one or the\nEuropean corps sent to the relief of\nLovitch. At a critical moment, when\nthe enemy had broken through the\nRussinn lines in two places, the col\numn took up Its task on Us own Ini\ntiative. The commander at that time,\nnashklroff, dispatched two sertlons to\na neighboring village in charge of\nTerotlnln, son of the Emperor\'s phy\nsician, and myself.\n"A diplomat and a student, neither\nof whom had even been in war before,\ncould not Judge of the danger and we\nrode boldly Into the village, hulf of\nwhich had already been occupied by 1\ntne uermans, The latter opened fire\'0t\non our sanitary carriages with rapid\nfire guns. Part of the carriages were\ndestroyed. We recalled our men and\nstarted back as fast as we could. The\nGermans shelled the road over which\nwe rode to our headquarters, but found\nthat the road from Ixivltch had been\ncut. With the wounded we had pick\ned up we had to make a retreat of\nthirty-five miles in one night, most of\nthe way under the shell fire of the\nGermans, to Skiernivltze. There we\nfound that the town had been ordered\nevacuated by the Russian troops and\nwe were practically the only ones\nleft there. A hot flgftt was In pro\ngress outside the city.

In two\ndays, 3,017 wounded.\n"We were ordered than to move on\nwith the corps of the famous Oeneral\nMishenko, known as the Cossack Raid\ner of the Japanese war. We took up\nour work In his advance lines just at\nthe time the Germans made their\nsecond dash on Warsaw. Our corps\nstood firm for nine days, repulsing\nattack after attack. This nine days\namong the Caucasian, heroes was the\nmost trying and dangerous, but at the\nsame time the most instructive, of our\nexperiences. In one night seven hund\nred wounded were found and cared\nfor, the greater part in the trenches\nundi\'r heavy artillery fire. Several\nsanllars were wounded.\n"When new corps came to the res\ncue the Caucasians were ordered to\nmake a rapid move back to Join fresh\ntroops and begin an advance together.\nThe move was executed so suddenly\nand rapidly that the military aide had\nno time to tnke out the wounded ly\ning In several villages near by. The\nlast section of the column volunteered\nto, creep Into the village and rescue\nthe wounded who otherwise were\nthreatened with being burned, fire hav\ning broken out in several places.\nThrough the blackness of the night,\nlit only by the bin sting shells, we\nnuide our way into the village and re\nmoved eighty men from the danger\nzone. The staff considered them lost\nand upon learning of their rescue\nGeneral Mltthenko called out the her\noes of that night thanked them for\ntheir work and made them- the sub\nject of a flattering order to his regi\nment. Immediately after that the com\nmander of the column fell ill and I\nwas left in command.\n"Among the troops whose gallantry\nstopped the Germans a second time\nfrom coming to Warsaw were those\nthe First Siberian corps.\nFor the first time having seen the\nmagnetic Siberian officers," said Kal\npaschnikoff, "I decided to offer the\nservices of the column of that bril\nliant corps, I went to the commander\nof the corps. General I\'leshkoff, who\narcepted my services. 1 was fascinated\nby him, and my impression of \'him\ngained that day, as a man beloved by\nhis soldiers, big hearted and fatherly\nhas never changed."\nDuring the long tenure of the line\nof the Bsura river before Warsaw\nwhen the shelling at times was so In\ntense that it seemed to him that no\nhuman being eould live in the trenches\nKalpaschnikoff and his column took\nout and cared for several thousands\nPHONE 112\nof wounded, victims not only of shell\ning but of German gases.\nContinuing his narration, Comman\nder Kalpaschnikoff said:\n"About this time the\' Prassnlt\noperation came to a crisis. A blow was\nnecessary to stop the development of\nthe German plan directed on Vllna.\nThe Siberian corps was summoned to\nstart on a few hours\' notice and pro\nceed by forced marches 137 kilome\nters to Prassnltz over fearful roads\nand In wretched weather. Two days\nwas allowed to\' cover the distance.\nThe world knows of that brilliant\ndash and what was its result. The\nmilitary hospital, In this rapid march,\nnaa been le ftbehind. The Twenty-\nFirst Flying column followed and was\nthe first to enter after the city had\nbeen taken by the First and Third\nSiberian regiments. The sights we\nsaw cannot be adequately described.\nMore than 2700 wounded Gennans\nwithout having had any care whatever,\nwere lying or crawling about the\nstreets, hiding in basements and out\nbuildings, evidently hoping that the\nGermans would make a counter-attack\nand re-enter the city. The ditches\nwere full of dead and wounded as\nwere the open spaces about the city\nand the outlying villages. Many of\nour own men were scattered among\nthe German wounded. We found the\nwork almost beyond our capacity, far\nfrom a railroad and with the troops\nalways moving on. We formed con\ncentration camps at various points and\nput students In charge of them. In\nthese camps we collected 3,360 wound\ned." To accomplish the rescue Kalpasch\nnikoff and the student had to crawl\nmore than a mile along a ditch, but in\nplain view and In constant range of\nthe German trenches, but. In the\nword of Klapaschnikoff, "the Ger\nman soldiers shot rather badly."\nAfter the Germans left Heinoff the\npopulation was destitute and facing\nstarvation.

E. Redman, Traffic Manager, Qoldfleld, Nevada.\nRobt 4. Highland, Con. Agt, Tenepah, Nevada\nA AS\nTECHNICAL JOURNAL DISCUSSES\nTWO METALS THAT ARE MIN\nED IN NEVADA\nOne of the most spectacular advan\nces In commodity prices occasioned\nby the war says the Engineering &\nMining Journal has been In tungsten,\nboth metal and ore. This has been\ndue to the extraordinary demand for\ntungsten steel an essential consti\ntuent in making high-speed tool steel.\nBefore the war high-speed tool\nsteel was worth about 70 cents per\npound, tungsten about 60 cents per\npound and tungsten ore about $6 per\nunit. At present high speed tool\nsteel fetches about $3 per pound,\ntungsten about $5 per pound, and\ntungsten ore about $50 per unit. Bven\nat the enhanced prices supplies are\nscarce.\nThe fabulous price for tungsten ore\nhas stimulated prospecting for It\nthroughout North and South Ameri\nca. .\'This ore Is not known to occur\nIn large deposits. The annual pro\nduction of concentrated ore in the\nUnited States previous to the war\nwas only about 1,400 .tons. However,\nthis ore has now become so valuable\nthat the discovery of a deposit that\naffords a single carload is the finding\nof a fortune. - A ton of ore assaying\nbo per cent tungsten trioxtde the\nstandard commercial grade at 1 $50\nper unit la worth $3,000; a carload of\n40 tons would be $120,000. , So prec\nious is this ore that the assay offices\nare being scoured for specimens. Bro\nkers do not sneer at trade In one\npound lots. The purchasing agent of\nthe Crucible Steel company is very\ngrateful If somebody can give him 100\npounds. ,\nA contributory factor in the produc\ntion of this situation was the utter\nstupidity of the British authorities.\nThey fought the advance from the be\nginning. When they were offered\nsome tungsten ore, they came back\nwith a lower bid trying to dicker In\nwhat was not a dickering market\nand naturally failed to get what they\nwanted. Then they practically com\nmandeered the supply of tungsten ore\nin the British empire, appointing\nofficial brokers and fixing a price of\n55s per unit, or about $800 per 2,000\npounds of 60 per cent ore of exchange\nbe figured at 4.86. Previous to the\nwar that would have been, regarded\nas a fine price, but the producer In\nAustralia, Burma, Malaya and else-\nwhere does not think very much of\nit when the same grade of ore is\nfetching $3,000 or so per ton m Ameri\nca. : In the meanwhile there is relief\nimmediately at hand if the manufac\nwith B. G. R. R, both south,\nnorthbound\nturers of tool steel would only avail\nthemselves of it. We mean in the sub\nstitution of molybdenum steel for tun\ngsten steel. It is well known that\nmolybdenum steel has excellent quail\nties of more or less the same charac\nter as tungsten steel. It is claimed\nby some authorities that molybdenum\nsteel Is superior In certain respects\nto tungsten steel. . The chronic reluc\ntance of manufacturers to get out of\nthe beaten tracks Is offered as an ex\nplanation of their blindness to the\nmerits of molybdenum pteel. But\neven If it were not preferable with\ntungsten at 60 cents per pound, It\nmight be when that metal Is more\nthan eight times as high.\nThe point Is that molybdenum ore\nand the products thereof are now a\ndrug on the market. While the tungs\nten mines are being worked at the\nlimit of their capacity, the molybde\nnum mines have had to be closed, and\nthe smelters of molybdenum ore are\ncarrying large unsold stocks of the\nproducts that probably they would be\nglad to sell at cost;\nMA80NIC NOTICE\nA Called communication of To\nVV\' nopah lodge No. 28, F. & A.\nV M will be holden this Friday\nevening.

Mr. I.ind\npresented certain proposals to I Inert a\nchief of which was that the provls\nlonal president should resign an\npermit a national election at which\nhe would not be a candidate. Huert\nperemptorily rejected these propos\nals.\nIn the meant hue the Mexican con\ngress had been growing restive an\none senator had the hardihood to mnk\nan open attack on Huerta in the\nsenate chamber. He promptly disa\npeared and when his colleagues d\nmanded an investigation Huerta\nmarched a body of troops Into th\nnail or congress, seized 110 deputies\nsnd threw them in Jail.\nHis next step was to call an elec\ntion at which only Huertistas were\nallowed to vote with the result that\nhe was declared president with Gen\neral Blanquet vice-president. Mr.\nLind again demanded that Huerta re\nsign and, meeting with a second re\nfusal, left Mexico City on November\n12, for Vera Cruz.\nThroughout the winter the tension\nbetween the United States and Mexi\nco continued1 to grow more acute.\nAmerican warships were despatched\nto Mexican waters and a large num\nber of troops were concentrated on\nthe border. At the same time the\nConstitutionalists, as the" Carranza\ntaction called themselves, advanced\nfrom the north, defeating the Huerta\ntroops In battle after battle. j\nThe climax came in April vhen a\nparty of American bluejackets was\nseized at Vera Cruz and thrown into\nJail. The Americans were quickly re\nleased, but Huerta refused Persident\nWilson\'s demand for a formal salute\nto the stars and strips as a measure\nof reparation. On April 12 American\nbluejackets and marines landed at\nVera Cruz in force and occupied the\ncity after some street fighting In\nwhich a number of Americans were\nkilled.\nShortly afterwards a mediation pro\nposal was made by Argentina, Bra\nzil and Chile and accepted. Confer\nences were held at Niagara Falls, but\nbrought no decisive result.\nMatters dragged along until July\n7 when Huerta, his finances exhaust\ned, his army thoroughly beaten and\ndisorganized, his enemies growing\nsteadily stronger, presented his resig\nnation to the Mexican Congress. He\nsailed from Puerto, Mexico, a few\ndays later on the German cruiser\nDresden and after a short slay in\nJamaica, chartered a steamer and set\nout for Spain. On November 23\nPresident Wilson ordered the evacua\ntion of Vera Cruz.\nOn March 3, 1915, General Huerta\nleft Spain ostensibly for Buenos Aires.\nHe disembarked at Algectras, Morro\nco. and early In April boarded a\nsteamer for New York declaring he\nwas coming to this country simply\non a pleasure trip. After remaining\nIn New York for some lime he started\nwest with the announced Intention\nof visiting the San Francisco Pans\nma exposition.

N. Jones, familiarly known as\n"Dad," a 34th degree Elk, was given\na unique farewell reception last even\ning in the home of Tonopah lodge,\nNo. 1062, B. P. O. E. It was on the\noccasion of his departure for Califor\nnia, where be proposes to reside.\nThere was a large gathering of the\nantlered herd and a number of ad\ndresses were made. A turkey ban\nquet was served and afterwards pre\nsentation of a beautiful Elk pin was\nmade by the lodge, together with sev\neral other presents, which caused\nmuch hilarity on account of their\n"fitneBs." "Dad" left this morning\nand there was quite a delegation at\nthe train to bid him farewell.\nLifs Struggle of the Trees.\nAn interesting light is thrown on the\nlongevity of the trees tbat grow along\nthe timber line of the Rocky moun\ntains by Mr. Kiios A. Mills til bis\n"Rocky Mountain Wonderland." He\nsays:\n. A few timber line trees live a thou\nsand years, but half this time is a ripe\nold age for most of the timber line\nveterans. The age of these trees can\nnot be judged by tbelr size or by their\ngeneral appearance. There may be\ncenturies of difference In the ages of\ntwo arm lu arm trees of similar size.\n1 examined two trees tbat were grow\ning within a few yards of each other\nIn the shelter of a crag. Oue was\nfourteen feet high and sixteen inches\nin diameter and had 337 annual rlags.\nThe other was seven feet high and five\ninches In diameter and had lived 4U2\nyears.\nUna day by the sunny aud sheltered\nside of a bowlder 1 found a tiny seed\nbearer at an altitude of ll.Stst feet.\nHow splendidly unconscious it wss of\nIt slse aud lis utterly wild surround\nings!

Camilla\nKlammarlon, a rather speculative snd\nseusalioual astronomer, declares that\nbe has seen and conversed with the\n"ghosts" or dead friends. Professor\nWilliam James, brother of Henry\nJames, the novelist, promised before\nbe died that if possible be would com\nmunicate with bis frleud Professor\nHyslop, both eminent psychologists,\nbut at last account the soul of Profes\nsor Jamea bad not sKken.
