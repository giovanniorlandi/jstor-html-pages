Epidemiological, experimental, and clinical data sustain the idea that\nhelminths could provide protection against IBD. Studies investigating the underlying mechanisms by which helminths might\ninduce such protection have revealed the importance of regulatory pathways, for example, regulatory T-cells. Further investigation\non how helminths influence both innate and adaptive immune reactions will shed more light on the complex pathways used\nby helminths to regulate the hosts immune system. Although therapy with living helminths appears to be effective in several\nimmunological diseases, the disadvantages of a treatment based on living parasites are explicit. Therefore, the identification and\ncharacterization of helminth-derived immunomodulatory molecules that contribute to the protective effect could lead to new\ntherapeutic approaches in IBD and other immune diseases.\nCopyright © 2008 Nathalie E.

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES AND\nTHE HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as Crohn’s disease\nand ulcerative colitis, are chronic immune diseases of the gastrointestinal\ntract. Although the aetiologies of these diseases\nstill remain unknown, the current hypothesis indicates that\nIBD results from an uncontrolled immune response to the\nnormal gut flora [1, 2]. Genetic factors and environmental\nfactors both contribute to the damaging mucosal immune\nresponse [3, 4].\nThe incidence of IBD has steadily increased in the\ndeveloped world since 1950 [5, 6]. According to the hygiene\nhypothesis, this is directly related to the higher hygienic\nstandards in these countries [7, 8]. It is suggested that the\nlack of exposure to infectious agents like helminths, as a\nresult of improved living standards and medical conditions,\nmodulates the development of the immune system and\nthereby increases the risk of immune diseases [9, 10].\nThe hygiene hypothesis was initially proposed by Strachan\nin 1989 for hay fever [11] and additional epidemi-\nological studies were performed to further investigate the\nlink between this hygiene concept and the incidence of\nother immunological diseases. As a consequence, the hygiene\nhypothesis is now proposed for several immunological disorders\nsuch as asthma and allergic diseases [12], cardiovascular\ndiseases [13], Type 1 diabetes mellitus [14], multiple sclerosis\n[15], and IBD [16].\nThe hygiene hypothesis for IBD is clearly supported\nby the geographical distribution of the disease. There is a\nwell described north-south gradient for the incidence of\nIBD. Northern Europe and North America have the highest\nIBD incidence rates whereas Crohn’s disease and ulcerative\ncolitis remain scarce in South America, Africa, and Asia\n[6, 17]. However, the gap between high- and low-incidence\nareas in northern versus southern regions is narrowing.\nIn Asia, for example, incidence rates still remain low as\ncompared to Europe, but they are rapidly increasing [18].\n', '2 Clinical and Developmental Immunology\nChanging lifestyle is thought to be the major cause of\nthe disease increase in low-incidence areas [18]. The most\nimportant factor to explain these geographical differences is\nthe socioeconomic level [16]. IBD is more frequently seen\namong patients with a higher socioeconomic status [19, 20].\nHigher socioeconomic levels can be associated with better\nsanitation conditions, high-quality water, and better medical\nstandards [2].\nAnother factor supporting the hygiene hypothesis is the\ninverse relationship between infant mortality rates and the\nincidence of IBD. Infant mortality might be linked to worse\nhygiene and medical conditions. Countries with high infant\nmortality rates consequently have lower reported incidence\nof IBD [21].\nAs mentioned previously, better hygienic circumstances\ntranslate into diminished exposure to infectious agents like\nhelminths. The absence of such parasitic infections during\nchildhood renders the immune system more prone to allergic\nand immune diseases. Thus infections seem to activate an\nimportant protective factor against these disorders [7]. Identifying\nthe nature of this protective effect and implementing\nthis notion in therapeutic strategies against IBD and other\nimmune diseases is now the challenge for basic research.\n2. IMMUNOLOGY OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT\n2.1. Initiating innate and adaptive immune responses\nto enteric antigens in the gut\nThe gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to a wide\nrange of dietary and environmental antigens, both harmless\nand pathogenic. Mounting protective immune responses\nagainst harmful pathogens whilst also preventing excessive\nresponses to harmless antigens from food and bacterial flora\nis one of the major dichotomous functions of the mucosal\nimmune system [22].\nThere are different levels of host defence that pathogens\nhave to trespass to induce inflammation. Numerous mechanisms\nare acting to form a physical barrier to prevent micro-\norganisms from gaining access to the underlying tissues.\nProduction of saliva and mucus, gastric and pancreatic\njuices, intestinal peristalsis, and epithelial cells all contribute\nto the elimination of pathogens from the gut lumen [23, 24].\nTight junctions between epithelial cells form a barrier to\nprevent bacterial pathogens from invading the gut tissue [25–\n27]. Once a pathogen breaks through this physical barrier,\ninnate and adaptive immune responses work closely together\nto eliminate the intruder [28].\nAntigens in the gut lumen can be taken up via different\ntransport routes [29]. The innate immune system will\nrespond to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).\nAs a part of the innate immune system, phagocytes like\nmonocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, and cytotoxic\ncells like natural killer cells rapidly control the invasion [30].\nThe adaptive immune system responds to antigens which\nhave been presented by cells of the innate immune system\n[30]. Once antigens are taken up by antigen presenting\ncells, such as dendritic cells, fragments of the antigen\nare presented to T-cells locally or in mesenteric lymph\nHelminth infections\nCD4+CD25+ Treg\nIL-10\nTrl cell\nIL-17\nTNF-α\nTGF-β\nCrohn’s disease\nTh3 cell\nIL-10\nTGF-β\nNaı̈ve T cell\nIL-12\nIFN-γ Th1 cell\nIL-23\nIL-4\nTh2 cell\nIL-2\nIL-12\nIFN-γ\nTh17 cell\nIL-4\nIL-5\nIL-13\nIL-6\nFigure 1: T-cell subsets. Naı̈ve CD4+ T cells are stimulated by\nantigen presenting cells and the cytokine environment to proliferate\ninto a certain subset. There are three distinct effector T-cell subsets\n(red): Th1, Th2, and Th17. CD4+ regulatory T-cells (green) can be\nsubdivided in CD4+CD25+ Treg, Tr1, and Th3 cells. Crohn’s disease\nis characterized by Th1, Th17 inflammation, whereas helminths\ninduce Th2 and regulatory T-cells (modified from [36, 37]).\nnodes (MLNs) after migration of the antigen presenting\ncells [31, 32]. Adaptive immune responses are initiated by\nstimulation of lymphocytes. T-cells will help B lymphocytes\nto secrete immunoglobulins, the antigen-specific antibodies\nthat are responsible for eliminating extracellular pathogens.\nOn the other hand, T lymphocytes eradicate intracellular\npathogens and mediate, for example, antihelminth and\nallergic responses [23]. Adaptive immune responses improve\non repeated exposure to a given antigen by the formation of\nB and T memory cells [28].\n2.2. T cell subsets and the immunological basis of\nhelminth therapy in IBD\nT lymphocytes are characterized by their cell-surface antigens\ncalled CD (cluster of differentiation) antigens. A\ncommon CD antigen found on all T-cells is the CD3\nmolecule which forms an essential part of the T-cell receptor\nand is important in the recognition of antigens presented\nby antigen presenting cells [33]. Within this pool of T\nlymphocytes, a difference is made between cytotoxic Tcells\n(CD8+) and helper T-cells (CD4+). CD4+ T-cells\ncan orchestrate the functional activity of both innate and\nadaptive immune systems by “helping” macrophages, NK\ncells, CD8+ T-cells, and B cells. These T helper (Th) cells can\nbe divided into several subsets of CD4+ cells and each subset\nis suited for coordinating the effector activities that best\ncombat the invading pathogen [34]. CD4+ T lymphocytes\ncan be classified into distinct populations based on the\ncytokines they produce (Figure 1) [35–37].\nEffector CD4+ T cells are divided into three distinct\nlineages. T helper 1 (Th1) cells are engaged in the eradication\nof intracellular pathogens (e.g., intracellular bacteria and\nviruses) and are characterized by the production of IL2,\nIL-12, and IFN-γ [38]. Gastrointestinal inflammation\nduring Crohn’s disease is Th1 mediated [23]. T helper 2\n(Th2) cells stimulate B-cell antibody production, eosinophil\nrecruitment and mucosal expulsion mechanisms and are\ncharacterized by the secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13\n', 'Nathalie E. Ruyssers et al. 3\n[38]. Th2 cells enhance elimination of parasitic helminth\ninfections and support allergic responses. During helminth\ninfection, the host evokes a strong Th2 immune response\nto provide protection against worm colonization [39]. The\ncytokines produced by Th1 and Th2 cells crossregulate\neach other’s development and activity, for example, IFNγ\nproduced by Th1 cells amplifies Th1 development and\ninhibits proliferation of Th2 cells [35]. In this way, helminths\ncan evoke an immune response that might be able to\nattenuate the Th1 response found during Crohn’s disease.\nA third lineage of effector CD4+ cells has been recently\ndiscovered and is characterized by the production of IL17,\nthe Th17 cell. IL-17 induces expression of many innate\ninflammatory mediators such as IL-6, acute phase proteins,\ngranulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and prostaglandin E2.\nTh1 and Th2 cytokines can inhibit Th17 development, while\nTh1 and Th2 effector cells seem resistant to IL17 expression\n[40]. It is now clear that the Th17 pathway is critical for the\ndevelopment of inflammation. IL17 is elevated in a variety of\ninflammatory conditions as shown for rheumatoid arthritis,\nasthma, and recently IBD [41]. Furthermore, it has been\nshown that IL-23 supports the proliferation of Th17 cells.\nIL-23 is mainly produced by activated myeloid cells such\nas macrophages and dendritic cells. The discovery of this\nnew IL-23/IL-17 pathway was a major breakthrough in the\nimmunopathogenesis of IBD and the exact role of this axis\nneeds to be further defined [41, 42]. Investigation of the\neffect of helminth infections on the IL-23/IL-17 pathway\nmay uncover additional immunological pathways by which\nhelminths can provide protection against immune disorders.\nAside from these effector T-cells, another population\nof CD3+ cells called regulatory T (Treg) cells have been\ndescribed. Treg cells have immunosuppressive function and\ncytokine profiles distinct from either Th1, Th2, or Th17\nT-cells [43]. By suppressing excessive Th1, Th2, or Th17\nimmune responses, Treg cells play an important role in\nthe maintenance of self-tolerance, thus preventing autoimmune\ndiseases, as well as inhibiting harmful inflammatory\ndiseases such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease\n[44]. There is emerging evidence that distinct subgroups of\nCD4+, CD8+, and natural killer T cells mediate immune\nregulatory mechanisms [45]. The most attention is being\npaid to the CD4+ Treg cells which can be subdivided into\ndifferent subsets. These include the natural CD4+CD25+\nTreg cells, which inhibit immune responses through cell-cell\ncontact and through the production of immunosuppressive\ncytokines, type 1 Tr (Tr1) cells which secrete high levels\nof IL-10 and type 3 T (Th3) cells which primarily secrete\nTGF-β [43]. Treg lymphocytes suppress the differentiation\nof both Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes and are considered real\ngatekeepers of the mucosal immune response [2].\nThe balance between Th1, Th2, and Treg cells is of\nspecial interest in the gastrointestinal immune system. The\ngut provides a unique microenvironment prone to Treg\ncell differentiation. This microenvironment is characterized\nby the constant exposure to commensal flora and food\nantigens and by the presence of immunomodulatory factors\nand cytokines that participate in the differentiation of the\nmucosal immune system [22]. Defects of the regulatory\nmechanisms may lead to development of specific Th1- or\nTh2- mediated diseases.\nGiven that helminths induce a distinct immunological\nmechanism compared to IBD, worms can be used as\nimmunomodulators to downregulate the immune response\nin IBD. Helminths induce Th2 and Treg cells which are\ncapable of suppressing Th1 effector cells, the cells responsible\nfor maintenance of inflammation in IBD patients.\n3. HELMINTHS AS THERAPEUTIC AGENTS IN IBD\n3.1. Experimental and clinical studies supporting\nhelminth-based therapy\nHelminths colonize more than one third of the world\npopulation [46]. In developed countries, these parasites have\nbeen largely eradicated as a public health concern due to\nthe availability of efficacious drugs and better sanitation\nconditions [47]. In developing countries, however, helminth\ncolonization is still common [48]. As shown by epidemiological\nstudies, there is an inverse relation between the frequency\nof worm colonization and the prevalence of IBD [46]. It was\nElliott et al. who first proposed the hypothesis that the loss\nof exposure to parasitic worms increased the risk of IBD\n[49, 50].\nPreliminary data of Elliott et al. illustrating a protective\nresponse of Schistosoma mansoni infection on trinitrobenzene\nsulphate (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice [49] have led\nto several experimental animal studies investigating the effect\nof helminth infections on IBD [2]. The first full study on\nhelminth modulation of experimentally induced colitis was\npublished by Reardon et al. in 2001. They showed that\ninfection of mice with the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta\nameliorated dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis\n[51]. Khan et al. subsequently showed that infection with\nthe nematode, Trichinella spiralis, protected mice from\ncolitis induced by intrarectal challenge with dinitrobenzene\nsulphate (DNBS) [52]. Elliott et al. demonstrated that\nschistosome eggs had a protective effect on TNBS-induced\ncolitis in mice [53] and that Heligmosomoides polygyrus\ncould reduce established colitis in IL-10 deficient mice\n[54]. We previously demonstrated a protective effect of\ninfection with the blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, on\ntrinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats\n[55]. Taken together, different helminth parasites (nematode,\ncestode, and trematode) can ameliorate colitis in different\nexperimental animal models [56]. Furthermore, helminths\nalso protect against other immunological diseases as shown\nin rodent models for asthma [57], type 1 diabetes mellitus\n[14], and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [17,\n58].\nBased on the promising findings of helminth infections\non experimental colitis, clinical studies were initiated. Treatment\nof patients with the porcine whipworm, Trichuris suis,\nresulted in clinical amelioration of both Crohn’s disease and\nulcerative colitis [59, 60]. In the same line, a proof of concept\nstudy showed clinical efficacy of experimental infection\nwith the human hookworm Necator americanus on Crohn’s\ndisease [61].

An international multicentre\nclinical trial is in preparation (awaiting FDA approval) to\nfurther investigate the clinical efficacy of helminth-based\ntherapy in IBD [2].\n3.2. The use of helminth-derived molecules\nas therapeutic agents\nAlthough helminth infections appear to be effective against\nIBD, treatment of patients with living helminths may\nenvision drawbacks. Persistent infection and/or invasion of\nthe parasite (particularly zoonotic ones) to other tissues in\nthe human host, where they might cause pathology, should\nbe considered [63, 64]. In 2006, Kradin et al. reported\nthat treatment of a pediatric Crohn’s disease patient with\nfive oral doses of Trichuris suis ova caused infection with\nliving sexually immature worms in the ileocecal region and a\nsexually mature male worm within the cecum [64]. Although\nhelminths may be beneficial in the treatment of IBD,\nusing living helminth ova can lead to infection, therefore,\ntherapeutic human helminth colonization needs to be closely\nexamined for potential adverse side effects. Furthermore,\nintestinal helminths influence gastrointestinal physiology.\nInfection with certain nematodes may induce enhanced\nintestinal propulsive activity, goblet cell hyperplasia, and\nincreased mucus secretion [65]. As a consequence, intestinal\nhelminths may alter gastrointestinal motility, possibly resulting\nin intestinal symptoms like diarrhoea and abdominal\ncramps [65]. Moreover, the idea of being infected with a\nliving parasite could be psychologically hard to accept for\nsome patients. Therefore, treatment with immunologically\nactive helminth molecules might overcome the possible\ndisadvantages of a therapy with living parasites.\nIdentification and characterization of helminth-derived\nimmunomodulatory molecules that contribute to the anticolitis\neffect could lead to new therapeutic approaches in\nIBD without the need for helminth infection [56, 66].\nUsing parasite extracts or synthetic drugs designed to mimic\nthe disease-modulating effect of helminth molecules also\nallows greater flexibility in dosing routes and therapeutic\napplications [67].\nHelminths possess evolved mechanisms to turn off\nproinflammatory cascades by secreting and expressing certain\nmolecules [37]. Multiple studies have characterized a\nbroad spectrum of helminth-derived immunomodulatory\nproducts. A detailed review of these products is beyond the\nscope of this paper so we will bring only some molecules\nof interest into focus. Maizels et al. showed that the\nfilarial nematode Brugia malayi produces homologues of\nthe mammalian cytokine TGF-β. Bm-tgh-2 is secreted by\nadult worms and binds to mammalian TGF-β receptors\nthus performing an immunomodulatory function in the\nhost [39]. Helminths secrete cysteine protease inhibitors\nwhich interfere with antigen presentation and increase IL10\nsecretion from macrophages [68]. Helminth-derived\ncarbohydrates contribute to the induction of Th2 immune\nresponses [69]. Lacto-N-fucopentaose III is the predominant\ncarbohydrate component of Schistosma mansoni egg antigens\nand this glycan stimulates the secretion of Th2 cytokines\n[70]. Harnett et al. recently showed that the phosphorylcholine\npart of the glycoconjugate ES-62, secreted by filarial\nnematodes, is responsible for its anti-inflammatory action\nin arthritis [71]. Research focusing on the development\nof vaccines against helminth infections also showed the\neffectiveness of helminth antigens as immunomodulators.\nVaccination studies against Schistosomiasis are focusing on\nthe protective effect of several Schistosoma antigens [72]. Vaccination\nstudies against human hookworm infections tested\nrecombinant excretory/secretory (ES) products from L3\nlarval stages of Ancylostoma caninum and promising results\nwere observed [73–75]. Furthermore, vaccination studies\nagainst hookworm infection revealed that administration\nof a cocktail of recombinant antigens has an improved\nprotective effect compared to the protection achieved with\nseparate antigens [76].\nIn respect to IBD, there is need for in-depth experimental\nstudies on the effect of helminth antigens on colitis.\nWe are currently investigating the therapeutic potential of\nprotein mixtures of Schistosoma mansoni and Ancylostoma\ncaninum on TNBS-induced colitis in mice. As shown in\nFigure 2, preliminary experiments showed that both S.\nmansoni soluble worm proteins and A. caninum ES products\nattenuated TNBS-induced inflammation of the murine colon\n[77]. These results indicate that the beneficial effect of\ntreatment with living worms on experimental colitis may be\nreproduced with soluble extracts of helminths. Yang et al.\nshowed that Schistosoma japonicum egg antigens inhibited\nthe development of asthma in a murine model [57]. S.\nmansoni antigens are also able to modulate innate immune\nresponses and prevent onset of type 1 diabetes [78]. These\n', 'Nathalie E. Ruyssers et al. 5\nstudies indicate that treatment with helminth extracts may\nbe as effective as treatment with living helminths and that\nthe achieved protection is not specific for just one helminth\nspecies. Isolated helminth proteins may provide a more\nreadily acceptable form of therapy for patients than living\nworms.\n4. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe hygiene hypothesis suggests an inverse relationship\nbetween parasitic infections and the incidence of IBD.\nEpidemiological, experimental, and clinical data sustain the\nidea that helminths could provide protection against IBD.\nThe importance of regulatory pathways such as regulatory\nT-cells, by which helminths induce such protection have\nbeen described. However, the complex pathways helminths\nactivate to regulate the host’s immune system need further\ninvestigation. Helminths influence innate as well as adaptive\nimmune responses and this knowledge can contribute to\nnew therapeutic approaches of helminth-induced protection.\nTherapy with living helminths appears to be effective in\nseveral immunological diseases. A logical next step, to avoid\nthe possible disadvantages of a treatment with living parasites,\nis the identification and characterization of helminth-\nderived immunosuppressive molecules that contribute to the\nprotective effect.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.
