When, a rapid and overwhelming fire is, wanted, the ranse is found, and the, ground within the limits of the pre, scribed area is swept from end to end, with a tornado of fire., In the French army this is called a, rafale (a squall or gust). It Is a series, of eight rounds per gun, each two, rounds being laid to burst 100 yards, farther than the last, thus sweeping, an area of say 400 yards with a rain, of shrapnel or a devastating series of, high explosive shells. "Sweeping" fire, Is a series of three rounds per gun, one, in the original line, one to the right, and one to the left. This Is also, and, significantly, called "mowing."

Denton Tecumseh Young of, blessed baseball memory. Mr. Young,, better known as "Cy." is the holder of, several records In unusual feats in the, pitching Una, It was back In April, 1004, that, Young proceeded to shatter all figures, in this line, and before ha got through, he had created a new record in hurling, hltless ball and one which stands to, day clean cut and without a spot or, blemish and without a doubt the great, est piece of pitching the game ever, witnessed., On April 30 against the Washington, team Young took Winter\'s place In the, third Inning, no one out, and pitched, out the game, retiring the ner.t twenty, one batsmen In order. Young\'s next, game took place May B against the, Athletics. Cy pitched the best game, of his long and honorable career that, day and retired twenty-seven of those, famous swatsmen of Connie Mack In, a row. In a game against Detroit on, May 11 Denton T. pitched his famous, fifteen inning 1 to 0 game against the, Tigers, and In the first seven Innings, Young set them down without a base, hit, This would give Cy twenty-three, Innings of hltless ball, or, In other, words, as far as the records show, six, ty-eight batsmen stepped to the plate, and were retired In succession. In that, same period the big Ohloan pitched, forty-eight consecutive Innings where, in his opponents failed to get a run, across the plate. After his great no, hlt-no run game against the Athletics, he pitched fifteen Innings of runless, ball, as mentioned, against the Tigers, with Ed Killlan opposing him. It was, a battle royal, and the clever KlUlaa, met defeat by a score of 1 to 0.—New, York Sun., SAN-TOX VBLVET~L0T10N — A, Creamy Liquid Lotion, Fragrant, ly Perfumed.
