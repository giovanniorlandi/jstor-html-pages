As long as the Soviet Union, the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran \nall back their clients, Afghanistan will remain . . . a fragmented society with firepower. ”\nAfghanistan: “ Back to Feudalism”\nB y  B a r n ett  R .

While \nthe resistance movement of the Afghan mujahideen, \nsupported by the United States, Pakistan, Saudi \nArabia, Iran, China and others, made a number of \nterritorial gains in 1989 and consolidated its hold \nover some areas of the country, the departure of the \nSoviet troops removed a major source of cohesion.\nThe mujahideen have thus far proved incapable \nof providing a viable political alternative to the \nKabul regime; the conflicts among them have in\xad\ntensified because of the competing political agendas \nof their various factions. These include conflicts be\xad\ntween parties competing for power or similar bases \nof support; Sunni mujahideen based in Pakistan \nand Shia mujahideen based in Iran; different sects\n*The views expressed in this article are those of the author \nalone.

The \nPashtuns (Afghans), the dominant ethnic group, are divided in\xad\nto rival tribal confederations, tribes and clans; the three largest \ngroups are the Durranis, from whom came the kings of Afghan\xad\nistan; the Ghilzai, the Durranis’ main rivals; and the Eastern \nPashtuns, who spill across the Pakistani frontier. The next \nlargest linguistic group is made up of Persian speakers, many of \nwhom regard themselves as Tajik. There are also important \nTurkic groups, Uzbeks and Turkmen. The Hazaras, a group of \nMongolian origin, are also Persian-speaking, but their racial \nheritage and Shia religion set them apart.\n2On factionalism in the PDPA, see Olivier Roy, “Le Double \nCode Afghan: Marxisme et Tribalisme,” Revue Frangaise de \nScience Politique, December, 1986, pp. 846—861; Anthony Ar\xad\nnold, Afghanistan’s Two-Party Communism: Parcham and Khalq \n(Stanford: Hoover Institution Press, 1983); and Raja Anwar, \nThe Tragedy ofAfghanistan: A First-Hand Account (London: Verso, \n1988).\nof Sunni Islam (Saudi-supported Wahhabism and \nthe indigenous tradition of Hanifi Islam); the field \ncommanders inside Afghanistan and the exiled \nleaders; traditionalists and Islamic radicals; \nPashtuns and ethnic minorities; and Ghilzai and \nDurrani Pashtuns.1\nThe maneuverings that have occurred since the \nFebruary, 1989, withdrawal are comprehensible \nonly if one bears in mind that this is not a war with \njust two sides; there are numerous Afghan con\xad\ntenders with various foreign supporters.\nThe Soviet Union supports the PDPA, which \nclaims it is no longer a “Marxist-Leninist” party. \nThe PDPA, founded in 1965, split into two antag\xad\nonistic factions in 1967 and reunited under Soviet \npressure a decade later. Each of the two main fac\xad\ntions, Parcham and Khalq, have different social \nbases and are in turn split into subfactions that are \nloyal to different leaders and are based in different \nparts of the state apparatus.2 One of Najibullah’s \nmajor achievements since he took over the party at \nSoviet insistence in May, 1986, has been the reduc\xad\ntion of factional conflict. Najibullah is currently the \nhead of the Parcham faction, whose members are \nmainly ethnically mixed upper-class urbanites. Na\xad\njibullah himself is from a Pashtun tribal family, \nwhich has helped him find a common language with \nthe members of Khalq, who are often of similar \nethnic backgrounds. Factional conflict, however \nmuted, is not gone, and it could resurge at any \ntime.\nThe PDPA-dominated government maintains \ntight control over the capital of Kabul and a some\xad\nwhat looser presence in most other major towns and \nregional centers. 1 The government uses most of the \nmain highways (with the exception of the Jalalabad- \nTorkham sector since November, 1988); it controls \nall airports and much of the flat steppe area north of \nthe Hindu Kush and adjacent to the Soviet border. \nThe government has reached peace agreements \nwith some local groups, which it supplies as govern\xad\nment “militias.” In areas controlled by these \nmilitias, however, the government generally has no \nformal administrative presence.\n421\n', '422 •  CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1989\nThe resistance consists of exiled political leaders \nand fighting units inside Afghanistan led by “com\xad\nmanders.”3 Some commanders have established \nlocal civil administration. Nearly all commanders \nare affiliated with a party, but the type of affiliation \nranges from ideological commitment to opportun\xad\nism based on patronage relations. The commanders \ngenerally do not take orders from the exiled leaders. \nThey derive their effectiveness and legitimacy not \nfrom party membership, but from their ability to \nfunction as local leaders acting as intermediaries \nwith outsiders. The government militias have a \nsimilar structure. The commanders control most of \nrural Afghanistan, especially the mountain areas.\nCommanders belonging to the Sunni Muslim \nmajority are generally affiliated with one of the \nseven parties based in Peshawar, Pakistan. These \nparties act as representatives of the approximately \nthree million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Since \nMay, 1985, these parties have formed a loose coali\xad\ntion called the Islamic Union of Mujahideen of Af\xad\nghanistan (“the Alliance”). Four of the parties repre\xad\nsent ideological and ethnic groupings within Af\xad\nghanistan’s Islamist (“fundamentalist”) movement, \nwhich played only a marginal role in national \npolitics before the war. The secular and tribal \npolitical leaders who dominated Afghan politics \nduring the royal and republican regimes and who \nwere associated with Afghan nationalism (including \nirredentist demands against Pakistan) have been \ndeprived of direct representation in the exiled \nleadership. Both Pakistan .and Saudi Arabia have \nsupported the emergence of Sunni religious leaders \nin Afghan politics. Throughout the war, the United \nStates subcontracted political decisions about which \nAfghans to support to the Pakistani military in\xad\ntelligence apparatus, the Inter-Services Intelligence \ndirectorate (ISI).\nThe former King of Afghanistan, Zaher Shah, \nhas lived in exile in Rome since he was deposed by \nhis cousin Daoud in 1973. He is a symbol of the \ntribally based traditional order in which religious \nleaders were integrated into the state as officials of \nthe legal and educational systems, but not as polit\xad\nical leaders. To many Afghans, he also represents \nthe period when Afghanistan enjoyed relative sta\xad\nbility and peace, some economic development and \ngood relations with the United States and the Soviet \nUnion. To the Islamists, he represents the period \nwhen the Soviet Union began to penetrate\n3The major work on the Afghan resistance is Olivier Roy, \nIslam and Resistance in Afghanistan (Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 1986).\n4Other portions of the accord provided for the repatriation of \nrefugees and for various “international guarantees” of the agree\xad\nment.\n5Congressional Record, 100th Cong., 2d session, 1988, pp. \nS1588-S1608.\nAfghanistan through aid, especially to the military. \nThe Pakistani government (mainly the late Presi\xad\ndent Mohammad Zia ul-Haq and the ISI) has con\xad\nsistently prevented him from contacting the mainly \nPashtun tribal refugees in Pakistan.\nTHE SOVIET WITHDRAWAL\nThe Soviet Union withdrew its forces under a \nUnited Nations-sponsored agreement signed in \nGeneva on April 14, 1988. In return for the Soviet \nUnion’s withdrawal over a nine-month period be\xad\nginning May 15, 1988, the United States and Paki\xad\nstan agreed to cease “interfering” in the “internal af\xad\nfairs” of Afghanistan. The text of the accords made \nit clear that this meant an end to aid to the mujahi\xad\ndeen as of May 15.4 The accord did not mean an \nend to the war, because the mujahideen, who were \nnot parties to the agreement, would continue their \nstruggle against the Kabul regime; instead, it was \nmeant to de-escalate external involvement as an es\xad\nsential step toward a political solution.\nCongressional pressure in Washington, D.C., \nhowever, effectively changed the agreement be\xad\ntween the superpowers. Critics in the House and \nSenate noted that the accord was “asymmetrical,” in \nthat it allowed the Soviet Union, but not the United \nStates, to continue aid to its clients.5 American dip\xad\nlomats proposed to their Soviet counterparts an \nagreement on “negative symmetry,” under which \nboth superpowers would refrain from aiding their \nclients. Soviet diplomats refused, citing their treaty \ncommitments to the government of Afghanistan. \nAs an alternative, the United States proposed “pos\xad\nitive symmetry,” under which the United States \nwould reserve the right to aid the forces it supported \nin proportion to continuing Soviet aid to Kabul. \nThe Soviet Union never formally accepted positive \nsymmetry, but it signed and subsequently imple\xad\nmented the treaty nonetheless.\nThe Soviet withdrawal took place in two stages; \nthe accord provided for the withdrawal of half the \nSoviet troops in the first three months of the pullout. \nDuring this period, the troops retreated to garrisons \nalong the ring road linking the main cities and along \nthe roads leading north from Kabul and Herat, the \nmain exit routes to the Soviet Union. After the \ntroops withdrew, several regime-held garrisons and \ntowns were captured or occupied by the mujahi\xad\ndeen, although many fewer than their supporters \nhad predicted.\nBy October, there were reports that the govern\xad\nment garrison in Kandahar was on the verge of \ndefecting to the tribally based mujahideen in the \narea, but the Pakistani-sponsored Islamic radical \nGulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of one of the two \nparties called Hezb-e Islami (Islamic party), \nentered the area with several hundred soldiers; the\n', 'Afghanistan: “Back to Feudalism” •  423\ngovernment garrison subsequently called for rein\xad\nforcements from Kabul. In November, several \nhundred soldiers and officers again attempted a \ncoup in Kandahar. The eastern front also wavered \nwhen the government garrison at the key border \npost of Torkham, along the main road from \nPeshawar to Jalalabad and Kabul atop the Khyber \nPass, defected to the Pakistanis on November 3.\nOn November 4, the day after the Torkham gar\xad\nrison first defected, the Soviet Union announced \nthat it was “suspending” its withdrawal in protest \nagainst what it called continuing violations of the \nGeneva accord by Pakistan, which was cooperating \nwith the United States policy of positive symmetry. \nThe Soviet Union announced the introduction of \nnew sophisticated weapons, including Scud-B \nmissiles capable of reaching Peshawar from bases in \nKabul. Despite the announced “suspension” of the \nwithdrawal and the continuing United States-Paki- \nstani commitment to positive symmetry, however, \nthe Soviet Union completed its troop withdrawal by \nthe appointed deadline.\nCONTENTION FOR POWER\nAfter his appointment in May, 1986, Najibullah \nprepared the groundwork in Afghanistan for a \nSoviet withdrawal. His strategy included both an \nintensification of the counterinsurgency measures \nhe had helped to implement as head of the secret \npolice and the offer of political participation to other \norganized political forces. He formalized this offer \nin a proposal for “national reconciliation,” which he \nannounced on December 30, 1986.6 This proposal \ncalled for a cease-fire and negotiations among all \nAfghan parties, leading to a coalition government \nthat might include both the PDPA and the \nresistance leaders. Equally important was the \ngovernment’s offer to incorporate into local power \nstructures resistance commanders who agreed to \ncease fighting the government.\nThe resistance leaders and all significant com\xad\nmanders rejected the offer, but the Peshawar \nAlliance was unable to make a convincing counter\xad\nproposal. After months of American and Pakistani \npressure, it announced a partial list of an “interim \ngovernment of Afghanistan” on June 19, 1987. This\n6The national reconciliation plan may have been conceived \nin Moscow; it derives from Gorbachev’s “new political thinking” \nmuch more than from any known developments within the \nPDPA. Najibullah announced the program only after he and \nthe entire top leadership returned from a sudden visit to \nMoscow a few weeks after the Politburo voted to withdraw \nSoviet troops from Afghanistan.\n7“Un eouvemement introuvable,” Defis Afghans, February- \nJune, 1988, pp. 14-15.\n8On the second track, see Barnett R. Rubin, “Afghanistan \nafter Geneva: The Next Round,” Orbis, vol. 33, no. 1 (Winter, \n1989), pp. 57-72.\nlist consisted entirely of members of the Peshawar \nbureaucracies and was led by a Wahhabi from the \nIslamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan in \ndeference to Saudi financial support. It received lit\xad\ntle support from the commanders or refugees, and it \nwas not recognized by any foreign government.7\nAs the Soviet withdrawal progressed, the maneu- \nverings intensified. In November, 1987, Najibullah \npresided over a Loya Jirga (Great Council), which \napproved a new constitution and changed the name \nof the state back to the Republic of Afghanistan (the \nwould-be revolutionaries of 1978 had changed it to \nthe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan). In June, \n1988, he appointed Hasan Sharq, who claimed not \nto be a member of the PDPA, as Prime Minister. \nThe resistance, however, regarded Sharq as a \nSoviet agent; like other attempts to broaden the \ngovernment before the Soviet withdrawal, this \nmaneuver failed. By October, as the security situa\xad\ntion seemed increasingly unstable, factional strug\xad\ngles re-emerged within the PDPA.\nMeanwhile, the United Nations was working on \na “second track” of negotiations to complement the \n“first track,” which had been concluded at Geneva. \nThe purpose of the second track was to establish a \nnew government in Afghanistan to make possible \nthe return of refugees and the reconstruction of the \ndevastated country.8 On July 9, 1988, at a press \nconference in Islamabad, United Nations Under \nSecretary General Diego Cordovez proposed the re\xad\nplacement of Najibullah’s government by a “Na\xad\ntional Government for Peace and Reconstruction.” \nThis government, to be composed of respected \nfigures who were not closely identified with either \nthe Kabul regime or the resistance organizations, \nwould serve for a limited period of time. Then a \nLoya Jirga would be convened; it would include \nrepresentatives of all political, ethnic and social \nforces, and would approve a new constitution.\nSince none of the major contenders supported the \nproposal, it failed to launch second-track negotia\xad\ntions. Both the Soviet Union and the Pakistani \nForeign Ministry stepped in with new initiatives. \nOn October 14, Soviet President Mikhail Gor\xad\nbachev appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli \nVorontsov ambassador to Kabul. Vorontsov was \napparently charged with overseeing the final with\xad\ndrawal of Soviet troops and consulting with all the \nAfghan parties in an attempt to set up a more in\xad\nclusive interim government.\nIn December, 1988, Gorbachev outlined a new \ndiplomatic proposal. He reversed the Soviet position \nof the previous spring and offered to accept the \nAmerican proposal of negative symmetry, accom\xad\npanied by a cease-fire, an international conference \naimed at insuring the neutrality and demilitarization \nof Afghanistan, and domestic negotiations in accord\n', '424 •  CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1989\nwith the principle of national reconciliation.\nThe United States, however, reversed its position \nand rejected its own previous proposal of negative \nsymmetry. Citing the huge stockpiles and the new \nlevel of sophistication of weapons sent to Kabul (in\xad\ncluding Scud missiles and the newest model MiG \nfighter-bomber), the United States claimed that \nnegative symmetry would give an unfair advantage \nto Kabul. Vorontsov nonetheless followed up the \nSoviet initiative by pursuing a proposal for direct \ntalks with the exiled mujahideen leaders. Such di\xad\nrect talks with the Soviet Union, without the pres\xad\nence of the Kabul regime or the PDPA, had been \nthe main political demand of the resistance leaders, \nand the absence of such talks had been their main \nobjection to the diplomatic process.\nAfter a lower-level preparatory meeting in \nIslamabad, Vorontsov met with a delegation head\xad\ned by Burhanuddin Rabbani (who was then \nspokesman for the Alliance) in Taif, Saudi Arabia, \non December 3-4, 1988. These discussions con\xad\ntinued on January 6, 1989, in Islamabad. Contrary \nto the wishes of the Peshawar Alliance, the Soviet \nU nion did not recognize it as the sole representative \nof Afghanistan’s political forces. Vorontsov met \nwith the Shia groups in Teheran and with Zaher \nShah in Rome. He sent messages asking important \ncommanders for meetings (Ahmad Shah Massoud, \nat least, refused, referring Vorontsov to Peshawar). \nOut of these talks, according to Vorontsov, a rough \nagreement emerged on a procedure for forming an \ninterim government. Vorontsov accepted the idea \nadvanced by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry of a \nshura. The shura was to include several hundred peo\xad\nple, including representatives of the Peshawar and \nIranian exiles, the ex-King, commanders, tribal \nelders, religious dignitaries and “good Muslims” \nfrom Kabul. Vorontsov insisted, however, that the \n“good Muslims” include representatives of the \nPDPA and Najibullah demanded that his bloc \nreceive 100 seats.9 It was over this point that the \nSunni alliance broke off talks in January. The \nPakistani military had also blocked the more con\xad\nciliatory approach of the Foreign Ministry in favor \nof a continued campaign for a military victory by \nthe Islamists.\n9SeligS.

They were supported in this \nexpectation by nearly all Western academic and \ngovernment specialists on the region (including this \nauthor). Some Soviet analysts, including a promi\xad\nnent general who had served as a military adviser in \nKabul, shared this view.10\nAs the winter deepened, food and fuel became in\xad\ncreasingly scarce in the capital. These shortages \nwere widely attributed to a blockade of the capital \nfrom the north (along the Salang highway linking \nKabul to the Soviet Union) by Ahmad Shah \nMassoud, commander of the Panjsher Valley and \nleader of the Supervisory Council of the North, \nwhich brought together Jamiat commanders from \nabout six northeastern provinces.\nUnusually heavy snows also played a role in the \nvolatile situation. The United Nations reported \ndangerous levels of malnutrition among pregnant \nwomen and infants in Kabul; Sadruddin Aga \nKhan, the United Nations Special Coordinator for \nHumanitarian and Economic Programs Relating to \nAfghanistan, tried to arrange an airlift to vital sup\xad\nplies. However, few teams were willing to make the \nflight under the seemingly insecure conditions, and \nthe Soviets began an air bridge that still continues, \ndelivering food supplies and weapons in 25 to 40 \nflights per day.11\nSoviet soldiers accompanied their final pull\xad\nout along the Salang highway with massive bomb\xad\ning of nearby villages and Scud missiles fired as far \nas the upper Panjsher, which seemed to indicate \nSoviet fear of an offensive by Massoud. Hundreds \nof villagers were killed, and the wounded had great \ndifficulty in finding treatment since the heavy \nsnows blocked many roads.\nAfter the withdrawal, a defiant Najibullah an\xad\nnounced the imposition of martial law to a rally of \nthousands of armed party members in Kabul. Na\xad\njibullah apparently decided that guarding against \nfactionalism in the party was the first priority after \nthe withdrawal, because a factionally inspired coup \nwas the most immediate danger to his power. Prime \nMinister Hasan Sharq, who had sent his family to \nIndia and whose daughter had applied to the Uni\xad\nversity of Chicago, resigned on February 20;12 in a \n(Continued on page 444)\nBarnett R.

For example, in\xad\nfant mortality is estimated (1986) at 119 per 1,000 \nlive births, a substantial reduction from the 145 per \n1,000 reported in 1965. Although Bangladesh has \nworked to reduce its high population growth rate, \nthe present population of about 106 million is ex\xad\npected to rise to 144 million in the year 2000, even \nwith a projected decrease in the growth rate from \n2.8 percent to 2.4 percent.\nThus in 1989 Bangladesh is still in the early \nstages of political development; it has severe limita\xad\ntions in economic development; and it is restricted \nin social development by the instability of its \npolitical system and the weakness of its economy. \nBangladesh will need the assistance of the interna\xad\ntional community for a long time to come. ■\nAFGHANISTAN \n(Continued from page 424)\ngesture to the Shia population, Najibullah reap\xad\npointed Sultan Ali Keshtmand, a Hazara Par- \nchami, to the post. He replaced six other nonparty \nmembers of the government with PDPA stalwarts \nand established a Supreme Defense Council, which \nwas composed of party leaders, to administer mar\xad\ntial law.\nIn the course of the next few months, Najibullah \ntried to effect a reconciliation with various PDPA \nfactions; he named Army Chief of Staff Shahnawaz \nTanai (a Khalqi), who had earlier been implicated \nin a Khalqi coup attempt, as defense minister; he \nreleased Shah Wali, the foreign minister of the late \nPresident Hafizullah Amin, from prison; and he \nappointed Mahmud Baryalai, former President \nBabrak Karmal’s brother and a leading Parchami, \nas First Deputy Prime Minister. Najibullah con\xad\ntinued his appeals for national reconciliation, \npleading with commanders to reach peace \nagreements with the government and elaborating \non his proposals for recognizing their local \nautonomy.\nTHE SHURA\nMeanwhile, under pressure from the Americans \nand Pakistanis to offer a more convincing alter\xad\nnative to Kabul, the Peshawar Alliance held a shura \n(council) on its own to choose an “interim govern\xad\nm ent.” However, the shura that convened in \nRawalpindi on February 10, 1989, failed to produce \na broad-based government, and it exacerbated\n13Edward Girardet, “Arab Extremists Exploit Afghan \n‘Jihad,” Christian Science Monitor, February 23, 1989.\nrather than resolved conflicts among the mujahi\xad\ndeen. While Iran campaigned vigorously for the \nmaximum number of seats for the Shia, Saudi \nArabia offered huge payoffs to assure that the clients \nof Iran, its main rival for influence in the Islamic \nworld, would not be represented.\nThe shura and the events surrounding it intensified \nseveral conflicts within the resistance. The exclusion \nof the Iran-based alliance embittered relations with \nthe Shia in Afghanistan and further turned Iran \nagainst the American- and Saudi-supported Sunni \nmujahideen. The choice of a Wahhabi as Prime \nMinister and the role of Saudi money further \nalienated the Shia and the Iranians, and intensified \nthe bitter resentment many Sunni Afghans felt at \nwhat they perceived as Saudi attempts to buy their \nloyalty. This resentment had been intensified by \nevents elsewhere. In Kunar, Jamil-ur-Rahman, a \nformer commander of the Hezb-e Islami \n(Hekmatyar), had established a Wahhabi organiza\xad\ntion outside the framework of the seven-party, \nalliance. He was generously funded and armed by \nSaudi donors, and several hundred Arab volunteers \nfought alongside him.\nAfter the fall of the provincial center, Jamil-ur- \nRahman founded an independent local shura \nparallel to the one founded by the commanders \nbelonging to the Alliance parties; the Arab money \nhe received enabled him to establish an organiza\xad\ntion powerful enough to take over the town’s prin\xad\ncipal mosque, a major symbol of legitimacy. Worst \nof all, Jamil-ur-Rahman and his followers, especial\xad\nly the Arabs, argued that government- or militia- \ncontrolled areas of Afghanistan had become non- \nMuslim territory inhabited by apostates. When \nthose areas were captured, they claimed, Islam re\xad\nquired the application of the laws offutuhat, or con\xad\nquest, which provided for the pillaging of property, \nthe execution of men, and the enslavement of \nwomen and children. Indeed, in several areas of \nKunar, the Wahhabi and other mujahideen under \ntheir influence had executed captured militia \nmembers, and raped and sold women. While Wah\xad\nhabi leader Abd-ur-Rabb-ur Rasul Sayyaf was not \nimplicated in these events, the opprobrium they \ngenerated affected his stature. The hatred of the \nArabs among mujahideen increased, and armed \nclashes occurred.13\nThe shura also intensified ethnic conflict. Rab- \nbani, the leader of the only party with a mainly non- \nPashtun following, received the fewest votes and \nconsequently he held the least important position in \nthe “interim government.” This was glaringly in\xad\nconsistent with his party’s position as the single \nmost important military force in the resistance. \nRabbani and his followers felt that Pakistan and the \nPashtuns had conspired to squeeze them out.\n', 'Articles Concluded •  445\nThe exclusion of Zaher Shah and his supporters \nalienated his tribal following. On February 8, two \ndays before the opening of the shura, a group in\xad\ncluding many elders and dignitaries of the Durrani \ntribes from Kandahar and western Afghanistan had \nstaged a demonstration in Peshawar in favor of \nZaher Shah. Club- and gun-wielding militants of \nthe Hezb-e Islami (Hekmatyar) had broken up the \ndemonstration, beating participants and journalists \nwhile Pakistani police looked on. The dominance of \nthe Ghilzai in the Alliance and consequently in the \ninterim government increased Durrani-Ghilzai ten\xad\nsions.14 Among the seven, the party that has the \nmost support among the traditional tribal elites, as \nwell as the secularized intelligentsia of the royal \nregime, is the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan \n(NIFA), led by Pir Sayyed Ahmad Gailani. The \nNIFA received the second smallest number of votes \nand was clearly out of favor with both the ISI and \nthe Islamists.\nFinally, the exiled leaders scarcely consulted the \ncommanders. Mohammad Eshaq, a representative \nof Ahmad Shah Massoud and a political officer of \nJamiat, was not appointed as a delegate to the shura, \nalthough he was in Pakistan at the time. Important \ncommanders who did participate, like Abdul Haq, \nKabul commander of Hezb-e Islami (Khales), \nplayed minor roles and left early in disgust. Once \nconstituted, the “Afghan Interim Government” \n(AIG) did not engage in consultations with the com\xad\nmanders, nor did it offer to recognize local shuras as \nthe base of a new representative and administrative \nstructure for the Afghan state. Instead, its ministers \nessentially asked the commanders to fight in order \nto establish them—the exiled leaders —in power in \nKabul. In many respects, Najibullah offered \nsignificantly more power, autonomy and aid to the \ncommanders. It is a testament to the strength of \nIslamic ideology and the hatred engendered by the \nPDPA’s record of terror and subservience to the \nSoviet Union that so few commanders accepted Na- \njibullah’s offers.\nTo gain credibility as a genuine contender \nfor state power, the interim government had to \nestablish itself on Afghan territory. This need led to \nthe battle of Jalalabad, the most crucial event since \nthe Soviet withdrawal.\n14OHvier Roy, “From Victory to Defeat in Afghanistan,” \nWashington Post, August 7, 1989.\n15The author was told this by mujahideen at the Ghaziabad \nState Farm during the first week of February.\nI6Despite the failure of the mujahideen to take Jalalabad, \nSaudi Arabia recognized the AIG, as did Bahrain, Malaysia \nand Sudan. The AIG Foreign Minister, Gulbuddin Hek\xad\nmatyar, was invited to occupy Afghanistan’s vacant seat in the \nO IC , but the OIC voted to give the seat to the “representative of \nthe Afghan mujahideen,” not the AIG as such. Neither Pakistan \nnor the United States have recognized the AIG.\nJALALABAD\nJalalabad was an obvious target for the Peshawar \nAlliance. The mujahideen controlled the main \nhighway from the Pakistani tribal territories up to \nthe last ridge before the city, and they had captured \nan excellent staging area in the Ghaziabad State \nFarm. The proximity of Jalalabad to Peshawar and \nthe ethnic composition of the area (mainly Ghilzai \nand Eastern Pashtun) made it more amenable to in\xad\nfluence by the ISI and the Peshawar Alliance than \nother areas. Since the mujahideen had no general \nstaff to plan such an operation, the ISI undertook \nthis function, probably with the participation of \nsome Americans as well. Since at least January, \n1989, ISI officers had been entering the area to \nestablish plans for the attack.15 Its timing was seem\xad\ningly influenced by the upcoming meeting of the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), \nwhich was to take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, \non March 13-16. Apparently, the intention was to \nhave the AIG operating in Jalalabad in time to re\xad\nquest recognition from the OIC and its member \nstates.16 The ISI and AIG, however, prevailed over \nthe commanders, and the assault began on March \n7, 1989.\nIn the event, the mujahideen overran the key \ngovernment post at Samarkhel, on the last ridge \nbefore the city, and they advanced toward the air\xad\nport, rendering it largely unusable for fixed-wing \naircraft. The mujahideen had some success in clos\xad\ning the road from Kabul, forcing the regime to \nresupply the garrison by helicopter. The expected \ndefections, however, did not materialize. The \nregime’s air power and artillery inflicted heavy \nlosses on the mujahideen (the heaviest of the war, \nby some reports). Government morale soared for \nthe first time since the beginning of the Soviet with\xad\ndrawal. By July, 1989, the regime was able, at least \ntemporarily, to retake the village of Samarkhel, if \nnot the nearby post, and to launch punitive strikes \nagainst Ghaziabad.\nMany factors, military and political, contributed \nto the failure of the mujahideen. The interpretation \nmost favorable to the AIG emphasized the fact that \nthe Soviet forces had mounted an unprecedented \n(and unanticipated) massive supply effort, that the \nmujahideen had neither artillery heavy enough to \nattack concrete bunkers nor mine-clearing equip\xad\nment, and that they were still exposed to air power \nagainst which they were vulnerable, if not defense\xad\nless. If this were the case, the answer clearly was \nthat heavy artillery, minesweepers and more \nStinger missiles were needed.\nA more detailed analysis of the operation casts \ndoubt on whether the lack of sufficient equipment \nand technical training was really the key problem. \nAfter all, the offensive was predicated in part on the\n', '446 •  CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1989\nexpectation of massive defections. It is no mystery \nthat they did not occur. In the same sector of the \nwar, mujahideen of the Hezb-e Islami (Khales) had \nmassacred the defectors from Torkham. Further\xad\nmore, Western reporters with the mujahideen dur\xad\ning the battle of Jalalabad again saw fighters \nshoot government soldiers who were trying to \nsurrender.17 Such incidents obviously increase any \nsoldier’s determination to fight, regardless of his \nallegiance.\nThe successful defense of Jalalabad boosted the \ncredibility of Najibullah’s claim that his government \nand party had staying power and had to be part of \nany political solution. The United States, whose \npolicy toward Afghanistan has increasingly come \nunder the control of ambassador to Pakistan Robert \nOakley, remained committed, despite internal dis\xad\nagreements, to viewing the Afghan policy as a test \ncase of the success of the policy of “rolling back” \nSoviet gains.18\nAs of this writing, at least publicly, all Sunni re\xad\nsistance leaders and the vast majority of com\xad\nmanders remain opposed to dealing politically with \nthe PDPA regime, which they hold responsible for \nthe Soviet invasion, the killing of over one million \nAfghans, the effective expulsion of one-third of the \npopulation (now refugees), and the devastation of \ntheir country.19 But while most of them are unwill\xad\ning to recognize Najibullah’s government, neither \ndo they want to risk their lives (and those of the mil\xad\nlions of Afghans living under government control) \nfor the sake of the AIG. Hence, de facto truces have \nevolved in much of Afghanistan. The resulting \nstalemate works to the advantage of Kabul, given \nthe expectation that the regime could last at most a \nfew months after the Soviet withdrawal.\nThe prospects for a successful offensive decreased \nover the summer as conflicts among the mujahideen \ncontinued to intensify.

The author cannot verify the report and has no \ninformation on the content of the reported discussions. The \nIran-based alliance has agreed in principle to hold talks with \n“non-Communist” members of the government, reflecting \nIran’s opposition to the AIG.\n20Roy, “From Victory to Defeat in Afghanistan.”\n21Steve Coll, “U.S. Envoy Reassigned in Afghanistan Policy \nClash,” Washington Post, August 10, 1989.\n22This article went to press before the meeting between \nUnited States Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet \nForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in late September.\nn Far Eastern Economic Review, July 13, 1989.\nistan received international coverage and created \nopen conflict in Peshawar for the first time in late \nJuly, when a commander of Hezb-e Islami (Hek- \nmatyar), Sayyed Jamal, killed 30 mujahideen of \nJam iat in the Farkhar district of Takhar province. \nFive of the victims were killed in an ambush, but the \nremaining 25 were executed in captivity. Among \nthose killed were several senior commanders of the \nCouncil of the North and one of the few major \nUzbek commanders in the resistance, Qazi Islam- \nuddin.20 Radio communications intercepted in \nPeshawar showed that, while the origin of the \ndispute might have been local, orders for the execu\xad\ntions came from Hekmatyar’s headquarters.\nDespite the determination of United States of\xad\nficials like Oakley to continue the policy of “rolling \nback” Soviet gains, the disarray of this policy began \nto generate a debate both inside and outside the \nUnited States government. The American special \nenvoy to the Afghan mujahideen, Edmund F. \nMcWilliams, who had been appointed in 1987, had \nconsistently argued against putting too much \nweight on the AIG and particularly on Hekmatyar. \nOakley had dissented from many of McWilliams’s \ncables and had finally engineered his dismissal.21 \nPressure to stop aid to Hekmatyar increased after the \nTakhar massacre and his withdrawal from the AIG.\nIn September, the United States suspended \npayments to the exile party offices, leaked plans to \nsupply the commanders directly — supposedly with \nthe help of the AIG — and renewed middle-level con\xad\nsultations with Zaher Shah. Furthermore, \nPakistani military chief General Aslam Beg publicly \nstated that, if Najibullah resigned, the mujahideen \nshould open talks with Kabul. All these signals, \nhowever, still fell short of a new policy.22\nFor the moment, as one journalist put it, \nAfghanistan is heading “back to feudalism.”23 The \ncommanders remain warlords in the countryside. \nNajibullah’s government, like the precolonial em\xad\npires of the region, is content to control the towns \nand roads, tries to strike deals with those it can and \nneutralize those it cannot. Neither Najibullah nor \nthe resistance leaders, despite the weapons they \nhave received, have enough legitimacy to reestablish \neven the weak state structure Afghanistan had \ndeveloped before 1978. The commanders enjoy \nlocal legitimacy, but they all lead a more or less nar\xad\nrow segment of the society. None of them can bring \nthe others together or form a dominant army. As \nlong as the Soviet Union, the United States, \nPakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran all back their \nclients, Afghanistan will remain not just a \nfragmented society, but a fragmented society with \nfirepower. No one prefers a civil war in Afghan\xad\nistan, but it is apparently still everyone’s second \nchoice. M\n']</pre>
