The following\naccount appeared in the Star-Hul\nlet in of the 27th inst. :\nTo have a slice of more than 11\nyears taken out of his life for\ncrime of which he knew nothing\nwhatsoever has been the unusual\nexperience of Yi Hang Kui, Kor\nean, according to a statement\nmade by him Christinas Eve, the\nday he was pardoned by Governor\nC .1. McCarthy.\nThis man was convicted of sec\nond degree murder in the court at\nLihue, Kauai, on March 10, 11)07,\nand sentenced by the late Judge\nJacob Hardy to imprisonment for\n-0 years. Excellent behavior in\njail reduced the term which he\nwould have had to serve to the\nextent that he would have been\nreleased in a year and a half any\nway.\nNearly 12 years ago a China\nman was found murdered in the\ncamp house at Koloa, Kauab in\nwhich Yi Hang Kui, his wife, and\nj "10I\'S l\'\'1\'\'\nThe wife \' had a\nparamour, another Korean, living\nin the same building, and there\nhad been trouble between Yi\nHang Kui and this man. Yi was\narrested immediately after the\nmurder and hustled oil\' to jail.\nWhenthe ease was called his wife\nand her paramour appeared as\nthe star witnesses, both testify\ning that Yi killed the Chinaman.\nUpon their evidence the convict\nion and sentence were based.\n"I had absolutely nothing to do\nwith the killing of the China\nman," declared Yi Hang Kui, as\nhe was about to regain his free\ndom, "i narety knew tlie man\nami uao notning whatever again\nit him. My wife died some years\nago and her lover has, I under\nstand, disappeared. I have been\nthe innocent victim of a wicked\nconspiracy which cost me nearly\n1 1 years in prison."\nYi proved quiet, orderly and\nrename lor a nunincr ol years\nand has been a trusty; in fact,\nfor quite a while he was permit\nted to work around government\nbuildings without a guard or\nother restraint except that lie\nshould report back at the prison\nat the regular time in the after\nnoon. :o:\nA Welcome Christmas Present\nThe long delayed pay of Co.

Tlif Advertiser\nis conducting a symposium dis\ncussion of t lie same anil will soon\npublish the various contributions\nto it.\nWe venture to predict iliat the\nmost valuable contributions to\n(he solution of the problem of\nrenewing and improving our\nlabor supply will be along the\nline of conserving and developing\nour home supply. The 10.000 and\nmore children in our schools\nought surely to guarantee our\nfuture labor supply if they were\nproperly reared, trained and educated.\nThe lirst prerequisite for their\nusefulness and efficiency in the\nfuture is a good physical const i\ntution so that when they are\nLii-own un thev may be able to do\nthe work of grown-ups. The child\nthat is neglected in infancy and\nyouth so that his constitution is\nundermined, and his health wreck\ned ; so that he drags along through\nlife- a poor anemic, inellicient t\nvalid, sick and miserable most of\nthe time, such a child becomes a\nlife-long burden, and liability in\nstead of an asset.\nAs a matter o investment, as\na matter of economic labor supply\nwe should take good c.are of these\n40,000 children, so that as far as\npossible, every single one of them\nwill be a valuable and efficient\nlabor asset, and no single one of\nthem an expensive and inefficient\nliability.\nThat will cost money? Yes,\nsure it will. Hut so, too, it costs\nmoney to \'import labor from the\nPhilippines, and it is pretty poor\nlabor at that. And it\'s going to\ncost more money, far more money,\nto take care of them by and by,\nwhen they are grown up and are\nconfirmed invalids, than to take\ncare of them now and save them\nfrom that fate, and ourselves\nfrom the burden of it.\nTake care of the children, they\nare our best and surest source of\nlabor, for the future.\nAnd again- in this connection,\nwe are reminded that it is up to\nus first, before anybody else does\ninything. to construct railroads\nmd get them inlo operation, haul\ning freight from all the near and\ndistant corners of 1 lie Island, and\nhave it ready and wailing for\nshipment over these hypothetical\nwharves and into the holds of the\nocean steamers mai sunn ne in\nthe hypothetical calm of these, at\npresent shallow and disturbed\nwaters. On the face of it, it is an\nlbsurd proposition. We have the\neight to ship, and we are ship\nping it the best way that we can,\nmd would gladly make use of u\nbetter way if we saw any such\nbetter way to use. Surely we\ncan\'t be expected to abandon Port\nAllen, and Ahukini and Kealia,\nand all the other actual landings,\nuntil we see something more tan\ngible at Xawiliwili than the blue\nprint plans and paper talk. Sure-\nIv we can\'t be expected to rail\nroad our valuable and perishable\nproducts to Xawiliwili. and then\nsit on them there wait nisi tor a\nbreakwater and a harbor to ar\nrive all the way from Washington\nto take car,e id\' them.\nWhen there is a store, you go\n(here to trade; not before; when\nthere is a moving picture show\nyou go Ihere to see it not before;\nwhen there is a church you go\nIhere to worship perhaps, any\nway md before. And when there\nis a harbor at Xawiliwili. or at\nleast some satisfactory assurance\nit. we will go there Willi our\ndiaeval conditions as regards\nroads, and social advantages, ami\neducation, and recreation, and\npublic utilities, such as . light.\nlower, water, sewers, etc. These\nare advantages that the better\nclass of people value very highly,\nand without which thev will not\nlive if they can help it. This\nmeans that they will look at the\nmost attractive homestead propo\nsition a long time befre accept\ning it. The result is that the\nhomesteads go, very largely, to\nthe people who\'"care for none of\nthese things; and with all defer\nence to the actual homesteader, a\nless desirable class. But this\ncommendable new scheme of the\nCoventor, very largely eliminates\nthese objections, and assures the\nhomesteader of the combined ad\nvantages of rural life, and of the\ntown or citv as well. It ought to\ngive a new status to homestead\ning, and set it on its feet us never\nbefore. Here\'s to a large success\nfor it, and it\'s adoption for Kauai\nfreight and not before.\nOF\nTIIK XAWILIWILI HARBOR\nOnce aaiu. our Hopes are re\nvived, and we are told to cheer\nhp and get ready to do our part\ntoward the actual realization of\nthe Xawiliwili deep sea harbor.\nTill: OLIVE BR AM\' 11\nI\'ROMISi:\nWe note that one feature of the\nproposed Waiakea homestead\nscheme is the location of a Home\nstead town not far from Hilo, in\nwhich the homesteaders may\ndwell and "enjoy the amenities of\nlife in a civilized up-to-date com\nmunity; and it shall be counted\nunto them .as actual residence on\ntheir various lonely homesteads.\nXow that is the sanest, and\nmot promising proposition that\nhas been evolved yet, in all the\nlong years of this homesteading\nwrangle, and we most heartily\ncommend the !overnor on the\ndevelopment of the scheme. The\ndistant, lonely segregation of a\nhomestead, when you have to\nlive on it is what gives it a black\neye. It means going back to me-\ntaki: CARL OF Tim VII 1 LI)\nThe good work done by the\nLihue community nurse- reviewed\nin anollier column, cmplinsizcs\nthe great importance of the work\ndone for Ihe children, and tin\ngreat need that there is for much\nmore of the same kind of thing.\nI These are the days when we hear\na. good deal about the conserva\nlion of national resources.

These, as I understand\nit, are the conditions on which\nthe appraisers are bound to make\n(heir valuations.\nHut in the case of Waiakea, as\nin a good many otner similar\ncases, a great cry of protest goes\nup against any such fair and\nhonest outcome of the apprais\nnieiit. The idea seems to be very\nwidely prevalent that because it\nis government property which is\nbeing disposed of, it should be\nmore or less given away, or sold\nfor a song, so that the fortunate\npurchasers may realize a hand\nsome profit on the same, without\ndoing much work, or giving fair\nvalue.\nThe land department is in\ncharge of a trust for the people,\none of large responsibility, and\nhas no right to dispose of these\nlands at anything less than their\nreal value. And to do so would\nbe most reprehensible, and ought\nto expose the land commissioner\nto the most serious criticism, or\ne\'cn to prosecution.\nThe idea seems to be more or\nless widely prevalent that home\nsteads are a gift distribution\nproposition, for the few fortun\nate applicants whom chance has\nfavored.

By far the\nhest plan, say poultry specialists\nif the United States Department\nof -Agriculture,-is to care for the\nHock in such a way that disease\nwill not Appear.- The aim in con\ntrolling the diseases of poultry is\nthey add, to learn how to irevent\nthem rather than how to cure.\nTo enlighten poultry owners as\nto the characteristics of the more\nimportant diseases in order that\nthey may intelligently use the\nmost improved methods of com-\nhating thein, Farmers\' Bulletin\n!).")", "Important Poultry Diseas\nes," has recently been published\nby the department. The causes,\nsymptoms, and treatment of poul\ntry ailments, from aspergillosis\n(brooder pneumonia) to worms,\nare given in this publication.\nKilling Often Advisable.\nAs all poultry is susceptible to\nmany diseases, some of which are\nhighly infectious and resist all\neffort of treatment, the bulletiu\nsuggests that when birds become\nsick it is often the best plan to\nkill them. The greater the num\nber of birds kept upon any farm\nor plot of ground, and the more\nthey are crowded together, the\nmore important are the measures\nfor excluding, eradication, and\npreventing the development of\ncauses of disease.\nlien disease appears among\npoultry the fowls should be re\nmoved from the poultry yard and\nii good coating of freshly slacked\nlime should be applied to the en\ntire surface of the ground, ae\ncording to the bulletin. After a\nfew days it should be plowed and\nthen cultivated three or four\ntimes at intervals of a week, and\nfinally sowed to some crop. It is\nbest to leave the ground unoccu\npied by fowls for some time after\nthe crop lias been taken off. After\nthe fowls have been returned the\npremises must be frequently\ncleaned and occasionally disin\nfected.\nHow to Disinfect.\nThe\' drinking fountains and\nfeed troughs must be washed\nevery week with boiling water or\nother disinfectant, and if any lice\nor mites are- found on the birds\nor in the house"the roosts and ad\njoining parts of the walls should\nbe minted with a mixture of kero\nsene, 1 quart, and crude carbolic\nacid or crude creosol, 1 teacupful\nThe house may be whitewashed\nwith freshly stacked Hme or\nsprayed with kerosene emulsion\nIn case of an actual outbreak of\na virulent disease it is well to add\nto each gallon of the whitewash\n(i ounces of crude carbolic acid\nGood disinfectants destroy the\ngerms of contagious diseases, the\nexternal parasites, such as lice\nand mites, and in some cases the\ne;i;s of parasitic worms, and\nshould be used frequently in and\nabout the poultry house.\nManuel Aguiar, of Kapan, has\n.ibout S00 hags of cassava which\nhe would like to dispose of as\nstock feed. The roots have not\nyet been dug up. They are locat\ned in Ihe homestead lot formerly\nowned by Fred Steel at Kapahi\nWhen Aguiar purchased this lot\nfrom Mr. Steel he bought the croj\nof cassava along with it. The\nstarch\' mill erected on the premi\nses is in such bad shape that it\nwcuhl hardly pay to put it 111\nrunning condition for manufac\nfining cassava into starch. The\nvalue of cassava as stock feed is\nnot well known. Cassava is\nknown locallv as pia. It contains\nprussic acid, and should be sliced\nand dried in the sun before feed\ning it to livestock. The curing\nprocess removes the prussic acid.\nGrove Farm plantation has\nbeen feeding work stock with cas\nsava cured 111 tins manner and\nground into ineab for a long time.\nNo trouble has been experienced\ndue to the presence of prussic\nacid in the plant since they have\nbeen feeding it. Cassava has a\nhigher feeding value than sweet\npotatoes. The dry meal is very\nmuch more concentrated, due to\nthe fact that most of the water in\nfood has been evaporated.\nWin. Hyde Bice has fed cassava\njust as it is dug out of the ground\nto hogs and has never lost any\npigs from this practice of feeding,\nbut it would not be advisable for\nfarmers to feed cassava in this\nform to valuable stock, for uu-\ncured, it does contain a quantity\nof prussic acid, and cases of prus-\nnc acid poisoning have been re\nported from the use of cassava\nas fed in the fresh state.\nThe corn leaf-hopper is doing\nconsiderable damage to young\ncorn at Mahelona Hospital farm.\nAlthough Mr. Jensen, manager of\nthe farm, planted acclimated va\nrieties of corn, the stormy wea\nther a few weeks ago set back the\ncrop so badly that the leaf-hopper\nwas able to get a foot-hold. The\ncounty agent has sent to the\nboard of agriculture and forestry\nin Honolulu for leaf-hopper pari\nshes. By releasing the parasites\nin his corn fields Mr. Jensen will\nnot be able to stop the damage to\nthis crop of corn, but will reduce\nthe ravages of the leaf-hopper on\nlater plantings.\nFarmers planting in new fields\nor fields that have been allowed to\ngrow up in weeds will have diffi\nculty in raising delicate crops in\nthese fields. Cut woriiMt and all\nkinds of insect jx?sts breed pro\nfusely in neglected fields, and as\nsoon as the land is put under\ncultivation they appear to feed\non the first young shoots. Cut\nworms and Japanese beetles are\nespecially liable to be numerous\non such fields. In breaking in\nnew land, cassava, sweet potatoes\nind velvet beans are desirable for\ntheir resistence to attack by in\nsects. Cane and pineapples are\npopular for jtheir resistence to\nsuch pests.\nDon J. Jarvis of Kalaheo, has\nadded a patch of strawberries to\nhis experiment plots. He intends\nto have plants for distribution\nafter his patch has made sufficient\nheadway to allow him to cut off\nrunners. He now has a large sup\nply of white Madera sweet pota\ntoe cuttings which he will propa\ngate in his exjerinient plots,\nIvalaheo farmers wlil be able te\nget cuttings of this splendid vari\nety later on.\nUniform products demand the\nlest prices. The county agent\ncan help you market a product\nthat can be depended upon. One\nof the\' greatest obstacles in mark\neting sweet potatoes is the exist\nence of so many different varie\nties, many of which are of inferior\nquality.

Commenting\nupon the reports the Governor\nyesterday said the appraisals of\nIhe lots to be hoinesteaded in the\nWaiakea tract were too low if any\nthing. Prior to the advertising of the\nlots for hoinesteading purposes,\n(Jovernor McCarthy said, the Ter\nritorv received an oiler of an\nacre for the (SlOO acres in the Wai\nakea tract, lie believed- he said,\nlhat this was not the highest\nprice the government could have\nreceived for the land, but it prob\nably could have re-leased it for\ntf.HM an acre.\nFor the whole tract, the Gover\nnor said, the Territory probably\ncould realized as much as $2,000,\nDIM), whereas, under the home\nsteading plan and the value plac\ned upon the lots by the land de\npart men t, the government will re\nceive barely !j?:00,000. And this\nwill all go back into the land in\nthe nature of roads and other im\nproveinents so that in the final\nanalysis the government receives\nnothing for the land.\nIn view of the reported protests\nagainst Ihe appraisals, the Gover\nnor pointed out the advantages\nthe homesteaders in the Waiakea\ndistrict will have over other dis\ntricts. Arrangements have been\nmade for theiocation of what will\nvirtually be a suburb to the city\nof Hilo by the alloting of a so\ncalled town lot to each home\nsteader who draws an agricultur\nal lot. These town lots will be\ngrouped about a mile from the\ncitv of Ililo ami residence on one\nof them will be equal to residence\non the agricultural tract.\nTaking into consideration the\nhigh value of the land to be home\nsteaded ami the efforts of the\ngovernment to improve the con\ndit ion of the homesteaders that\nprotests should be made is sur\nprising, the (Jovernor said.\nIN THE FUTURE\nless than half the time.

It may own be that fresh\nmen will be sent over to relieve\nthose who have been in the thick\nof the tight and have earned their\nrelease.\nDemobilization of such a vast\nforce as we have in Furope is a\ntremendous task. It can no more\nbe accomplished quickly than its\nopposite organizing, equipping,\npreparing for active service and\ntransporting a great military or\nganization to the front can be\naccomplished quickly. It is not\nalone the matter of bringing the\nmen home and of mustering them\nout. of the service, although that\nof itself is as great an undertak\ning as it was to put them across\nthe ocean. The United States has\nspent untold millions "abroad in\npublic works of various kinds. Of\ncourse nothing or next to nothing\nwill be reclaimed from the results\nof our expenditure on port and\nrailway terminals for the recept\nion of men and materials, and in\nother ways, but there will he a\ngreat amount of work to le done\nupon them before they are aban\ndoned. Then there are immense\nquantities of all sorts of war ma\nterial guns, munitions and other\nmaterials that are clearly ours,\nand that must be collected and\nbrought back. There are sick and\nwounded in hospitals, who will be\ncared for where they are as long\nas that is necessary and who will\nthen be taken to the returning\nships. The work of all our chari\ntable organizations will be\nbrought to an end and the person\nnel brought home. Moreover, the\ncontinued shipment of food for\nthe troops and for the civilian\npopulation and the replacement\n-if clothing and equipment worn\nnt or lost by the soldiers are\nreally, although not strictly, a\npart of demobilization.\nWhen we remember that not\nonly all our available sharping\nbut a still larger tonnage of Hrit\nisli vessels has been employed in\ncarrying men across the ocean at\nthe rate of about a quarter of a\nmillion a month, and that now\nwe have more than two million,\nmen to be repatriated, Ihere is\nnothing astonishing in the esti\nmate that will require fully two\nyears to establish the country\nagain on a normal peace basis.\nThe return is sure to be more\nleisurely lhan the feverishly per\nformed work of putting men into\nthe field. It will be not only\nfeasible but desirable that much\nof the shipping be now diverted to\noperations more pressing lhan the\nreturn of the American forces.\nIt is to be hoped that neither\nthe authorities nor the people will\nbe too anxious to complete the\ndemobilization in a hurry. It will\nbe an appreciated honor if some\nof our brave men and officers are\npermitted to share in the occupa\ntion of German forts and cities\nIn any event, the people of the de\nvastated regions and some others\nof our allies will long need mid.\nassistance as our men can give\nthem, and it will be given tin\ngrudgingly and ent husinsl icly.\nYouths\' Companion.\nall oyer the territory.
