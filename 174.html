At one of the great banquets, a roll of the distinguished guests was, called and the names properly ap, plauded. Mark Twain, busily engag, ed In low conversation with his neigh, bor. applauded without listening, vig, orously or mildly as the others led., Finally a name was followed by a, great burst of long and vehement clap, ping Thla must be some very great, person indeed, and Mark Twain, not, to be outdoue In his approval, stoutly, kept his hands going until all the oth, ers had finished., "Whose name was that we were Just, applauding?" he asked of his neighbor., "Mark Twain\'s!", But it was no matter—they took It all, as one of his Jokes., He was a wonder and a delight to, them. Whatever he did or said was, to them supremely amusing. When on, one occasion a speaker humorously re, ferred to his American habit of carry, ing a cotton umbrella, his reply that he, did so because it was the only kind of, an umbrella that an Englishman, wouldn\'t steal was repeated all over, England next day as one of the finest, examples of wit sine® the days of, Swift.—Palne\'s "Boys\' Life of Mark, j Twain" In St. Nicholas., USE OF THE TOOTHBRUSH, i, It Waa Unknown In England In Lord, Chaatarfiald\'a Time., When did the English Qrst adopt the, toothbrush ha bit. which In recent, times has been denounced by certain, medical authorities? In "Esmond", Thackeray makes Lord Caatlewood, spend "a tenth part of bis day In the, brushing of bis teeth and the oiling of J, his hair," and In doing so the nofellst j, commits a double anachronism., During the first half of the eighteenth j, century all fine gentlemen wore wigs j, and bad no use for oil on their hair,, while the toothbrush was so late as j, 1754 unknown to Lord Chesterfield.

Chesterfield says: i, "I hope you take great care of your j, mouth and teeth and that you clean, them well every morning with a sponge, and tepid water, with a few drops of, •rquebusade water dropi>ed Into It. I, do Insist upon your never using those, sticks or any hard substance whatever,, which always rub away the gums and I, destroy the varnish of the teeth."— I, London Saturday Review., Poiconfng a* a Diversion., Poisoning Is never likely again to be, come a fashionable diversion, as it, was from time to time In ancient, Rome. In B. (1 331. for Instance,, there waa a mysterious pestilence, which seemed to be particularly fatal, to leading men. At last a slave girl, gave Information to the authorities,, and a consequent police raid resulted, In the discovery of about twenty ma, trons. some of them of high patrician, families, busily i>re;«rlng drugs over, a fire They Insisted that the drugs, were not poisonous, but, being com, pelled to drluk them publicly in the, forum as a guarantee of good faith,, perished miserably Further informa, tions followed, and 170 matrons in all, were condemned. But this record was, soundly beaten In B.

He, came up from the depths of bis hole, as soon as the penetratiug smoke told, him that there was a fire on the prem, Ises and deliberately scratched earth, on the burning gross with his strong, claws until all danger was past. No, human being could have grasped the, situation more quickly or displayed, greater skill tn dealing with an un, familiar event, The First Stock Exchange., The Stock Exchange did not call It, self by that name till nearly the end, of the eighteenth century.

It has never-been told in, English except In more/or less frag, mentary fashion, and the English, speaking world has missed thereby a, romance worth reading., The tale is liberally blotted with, blood und 8tallied with incidents of, savage torture and treachery, for the, Yaquls are a savage people, but run, ning through it from beginning to end, are a fanatic love of country, an indom, itable courage and a hardihood that, have never been excelled., In certain parts of Mexico tbe name, of Yaqul has acquired terrors almost, legendary among the Ignorant classes, It has become a term with which to, frighten children. Even on the Ameri, can side of the border the Yaqui often, gets credit for being a more terrible, person than he really is. In point of, tact the Yaquis are the Apaches of, Mexico, with rather more than the, Apaches\' ability for organization and, stubborn resistance., Aided by the fact that the govern, ment opposed to them has ulways been, considerably weaker than that of the, United States and by the inaccessible, nature of the country that they love so, devotedly, they have the distinction of, being the only Indian tribe that has, never been thoroughly und completely, conquered by the whites. There have, always been detiant Yaqui outlaws in, the hills., The story of the Yaquls is the story, of their wars. Almost a century before, the landing of the Pilgrims in New, England un army of Spaniards with, their Indian allies moved northward, from Mexico City, conquering every, thing in their path When they reached, the bank of the Yaqui river they were, met by a large buud of Indians whose, leader drew a line in the soft earth., That line he forbade the Spaniards to, cross. The white men opened tire with, their cannon, but ufter a brief en, gagement the Yaquls routed them, The old Spanish chronicler states that, he had fought with most of the Mexi, can Indian tribes, but. he says. "1 have, never seen Indians tight like these.", That was almost 400 years ago, and, since then the Yuquis have fought al, most without eessutiou. The Mexicans, estimate that there have been utmost, 300 years of actual lighting between, Mexicans and Yuquis., Of late years the Mexican govern, ment had been udopting tbe only policy, against tbe tribe whii-b gave promise, of eventual success In quelling their, fighting spirit. This was the plan of, deportation, by which the Indians were, sent from Souora to far away Yucatan, as laborers on the plantations. Tills is, said to be the only fate that frightens, the Yaquls., It Is easy to Idealize the Yaquls at a, distance for their couruge. their hurdi, hood and their love of country. Just as, it is easy to paint them as Impossible, dernous for their cruelty aud treui hery, They have undoubtedly practl< ed sav, age tortures on their cuptives In the, past. Just us they have undoubtedly, broken treaties with the Mexican gov, eminent, but it is Just us true that, they are guided by a savage code of, ethics aud ure righting for lund that In, the last analysis belongs to them, for, they held it before Columbus was boru, In tlesh and blood the Yaqui Is not a, particularly romantic tigure. Ue is the, common laborer of Sonora. the peon, the herder of cuttle uud the tiller of, the soil in the Mexicuu towns of tbe, district many of the servants are, Yaquis. One of the chief difficulties in, subduing them has been the highly de, veloped clan spirit that prevails amoug, them, The outlaw from the hills, hard, pressed, slips his rille Into a mesquite, bush aud enters some peaceful village, of his people, where everybody will, swear that he has lived there for years, The Yaqul Is a medium sized Individ, ual as a rule, rather stockily built, with, a face broader and browner than that, of the North American Indian whom, the tourist sees in the west and who, adorns our buffalo nickels His wiry, endurance is truly remarkable Four, centuries of almost continual warfare., Interspersed with the hardest of hard, work on the ranches, have made him, tough as leather Hp will travel for, days at high speed through desert and, mountain with little or no food: he will, work all day In the fields under u sun, glare that reaches 150 degrees heat In, the direct rays. In fact, one of the, chief problems In connection with the, deportation scheme for handling the, Yaqui is that of tilling his place as a, laborer in Sonora.—Cleveland Plain, Dealer -—, Some Famoua Old Men., Palmerston was premier at eighty, one.
