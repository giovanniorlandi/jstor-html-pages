Every\npupil who appeared on the stage knew\nhis work. There was not n single\nhesitation or need nt any time, of a\nword or look from the prompter, if\nthere was one around. The remark\nwas made, "they are on to their\njobs." The patrons nnd teachers felt\na pardonable pride in the pupils and\ntheir performance.\nThe medals were delivered by J.\nPowell Royall and C. R. Brown, in\ntheir usual happy styles. The stage\nwas beautifully and profusely deco?\nrated for the occasion. All that was\nlacking to make everything just\nright, was a few more cool strong\nbreeezs.There was" hot air"a plenty.\nMonday\'s program.\nMonday night was given over to the\nexorcises of the Jcffersonian Literary\nSociety.

All of these people?we\nmean the men, not the women?are\nabout the same age as Mr. Peery, and\nseveral of them "a leetle the rise."\nA good dinner and a good time gen?\nerally was had, of course.\nDistressing Accident.\nThe distressing intelligence reached\nhere on Wednesday afternoon by Mrs.\nVance, from Mrs W. B. Stone, of\nBristol, stating that O. J. Vance had\nbeen killed near Cripple Creek in\nWythe county. A telegram from Bris?\ntol to the Roanoke Times on yester?\nday, states that Vance, who travels\nin a hack for Faucette-Peavler Shoe\nCo., of Bristol, was in the habit of\ncarrying a rifle to shoot game, and\nseeing a snake on the road side got\nout to shoot it, when in some manner\nthe gun was accidentally discharged\ninto his body, killing him almost in?\nstantly. Ollie J. Vance married Miss\nBessie Suthers here last February,\nand has made Tazewell his home, his\nj wife remaining here with her par?\nents, Mr. and Mrs. John D. Suthers.\nMr. Vance was ^a very successful\nsalesir.an and stood high with his\nhouse. He was brother to Mrs. Riley I\nStone, of Bristol, and Attorney S. M.\nVance and Mra. F. B. Anderson, of\nSanford, Fla. Mrs. Vance left here\nWednesday evening to be present at\nthe burial, which will - take place in\nBristol. Great sympathy is expressed\nhere for the young wife and her fam\nBy.\nRaven Register\nRed Men and Odd Fellows had a\nfine time the 28?Decoration Day.\nWe had a fine growing lain, but an\nawful storm.\nIR. L. Crawford has a big smile on\nthis morning?he had a big boy at\nhiB house. Only three boys out of\nthirteen.\nTAZEWELL,\nBIG EXPLOSION,\nTWOARE KILLED\nBody of Unknown Italian is\nTorn to Hundreds of Piec?\nes by Premature Blast.\nBy tlio premature explosion of dy?\nnamite and powder, two men were\nblown to atoms on Tuesday on the\nconstruction work at Cedar Bluff. The\nname of one of the victims was John\nMcCanche, an American, of Tennes?\nsee. The name of the other man, an\nItalian, could not be ascertained. It\nseems that the men were loading a\nrock, and had just about finished.\nForeman Grigsby, of Rinchnrt and\nDennis, contractors, had just passed\nby, telling the men how much ex?\nplosive to use, and had gotten only a\nshort distance away when the explo?\nsion occurred. It is said that UO\nsticks of dynamite and a lot of pow?\nder exploded. The bodies of the men (\nwere blown to fragments.\nBig Saving\nJudgu Martin Williams, of Giles,\nund his brother, Attorney-General,\nSamuel \\V. Williams, of Richmond,\nwere here on Wednesday as counsel\nin an injunction suit against W. B. ,\nHonaker, involving lands in Bland j\njounty.\nAttorney-General Williams as a \'\nmember of the State Board of Educa?\ntion, introduced the resolution obol- \'\nishing the office of State school exam- 1\niners, which passed the Board recent?\nly. By this act the State will save 1\nibout .$20,000 per year. The primary\nschools and school teachers of the 1\nState, would be materially helped\nilnng by the addition of this much\nmoney to their support. The office of \'\nState examiners, or inspectors, as\nLhey were known, was useless^from |1\nthe start, and the discontinuance uf\n\'be office, thinks Judge Williams, j\n,vill be heartily approved by the peo- \'\nrile of the State.\nJudge Martin Williams has repre?\nsented his district in the Legislature I\'\nfor years, and has been re-nominatcd j1\n:>y his people, and is certain of elec- \'\ntion. He is the author of the Whar- I\nton Insurance law, which seeks to 1\nprevent combination of insurance\n:ompnnics in the State for the fixing\n)f rates. The bill passed the House\ntwice but was defeated in the Sen\nite. Judge Williams says that his\nmi pose is to do what he can to have \'\nthis law enacted at the next session\nif the General Assembly, and nlso to\niress with all his might, a bill, now \'\nin course of preparation, looking to \'\ndie prevention of vote buying and\nfrauds generally in elections, in \'\nwhich efforts he will have the hearty\nmpport of the people, not only of his \'\nlistrict, but of the entire state.\nWill Receive New Applicants For\nCatawba Sanatorium\nRichmond, June 1. ? Persons wish?\ning to be admitted to the State Sana- ,\ntorium for incipient tuberculosis are\njrged by the State Health Depart?\nment to make early application. The\nHealth Commissioner, who has super?\nvision of the Sanatorium, expresses\nlis opinion that there will soon be\nvacancies in the isntitutinn and calls\nattention to the fact that in an insti?\ntution of such large size, patients are i\n:ontinually coming and going. "No |\nsuitable case," says Dr. Williams, |\n"will have to wait long for admission j\nto Catawba, and those who have not j\nappiled because they know the insti?\ntution is full are losing an opportuni- |\nty for early treatment and probable i\ncure. i\nCould\'nt Hear Them\nA large part?the principal part of ;\nthe pleasure and profit of tbo High\nSchool entertainment last Tuesday\nnight many people present didn\'t get\nbecause they could not hear what was\nsaid. This is the case, more or less,\nin all such public meetings, but. for\nmuch of it there is absolutely no ex- \'\ncuse whatsoever. In a hall tho size of,1\nthis chapel, there is no good reason\nwhy any speech, spoken or read, [\nshould not be heard by any one, in.\nany part of the room, who is not|\nafflicted with deafness. It is no ex-1\naggeration to say, that not three- j\nfourths or even one half, of the peo- j\npie present Tuesday evening could\nhear the speeches and essays deliver?\ned. Why? Two reasons: One, the\nacoustic properties of the hall are\nbad. The deep stage with its heavy\ncurtain hanging part of the way I\ndown, the speakers standing back |\nfrom the front of the stage, the\nsound of their voices rising quickly,\n(as all sounds do, particularly in a\nheated room) was caught in the top\nof the stage, and in that pesky cur?\ntain, which no one had the fore?\nthought to raise out of the way as\nfar as possible, and held there, and\nwas only faintly heard in the main\nauditorium. It mattered not that the I\nboys and girls had good, nice speeches1\nand good, strong voices, their efforts\nwere not appreciated as they would\nhave been, for the reason given?\nthey could hot be heard.\nAnother reason, the boys and girls\nVIRGINIA, FRIDAY, JUNE\ndu not make an effort to be heard, as\nthey might do. They do not aeem to\nappreciate the size of the room, and\nthat a natural, conversational tone is\nnot sufficiently full nnd strong to be\nheard. Mr. Bryan, Mr. Roosevelt,\nand all great speakers, with strong\nvoices, find it necessary to make an\nI effort to raise the pitch or increase\nthe volume, in order to be heard. In\nmost cases the teachers and trainers\narc to blame, if any one is, for this\ndefect. The young spenkers and rend?\ners do not know?are not supposed to\nknow, just how loud to apeak, and\nwith what animation and life, nnd\nsuch important details as these must\nbe looked after by the teachers. The\nwriter of this article does not mean\nto find fault, or criticise in any cen?\nsorious spirit, the boys and girls or\ntheir teachers, but only to call atten?\ntion to what everybody felt last Mon?\nday and Tuesday nights, was a ser?\nious hindrance to the largest profit to\nbe gotten from these entertainments,\nIt is a pity?it is almost a shame,\nfor a boy or girl to put weeks of hard\nwork on a speech or essay, and then\ndeliver the same to people who can\'t\nhear it. It wns made to be heard,\nand however great it may be, is use?\nless unless it can bo henrd by the\npeoplo. Take heed how ye speak, is\npretty good scripture, as well as,\n"tako heed how ye hear."\nShawvers Mill.\nShawvera Mills, May 30. ? We\nire having dry, hot weather. Corn\nsrops will be short.\nBov.

As we all know, Miss|\n(\'nulling has done more for the edu?\ncation of this section of the state |\nthan any other person, thereby be?\ncoming its best citizen; nnd it seem?\ned very fitting that on last Monday I\nafternoon a small company of those |\nwho had acted as agents in the move?\nment, should meet Miss Coulling in\nthe Beading Boom and quietly inform I\nher that her vacation was to be spent |\nin rest and recreation at Chatauqua.\nThe tribute from grateful hearts |\nwas hidden in n bunch of lovely flow?\ners, to make glad her heart while she ]\nis yet with us. That education\nbest which prepares one to live best,\nand not only what is taught, but I\nwhat the teacher is must be taken\ninto account. Perhaps Miss Coulling\'s\nearlier pupils, who are now bearing]\nthe heat and burden of the day, ap?\npreciate most what her faithfulness |\nto duty, high standards of character,\nand generous giving of herself to I\nwhatever was worth while, have]\nmeant as formative influences in their\nown lives. No greater thing can be I\nsaid of any teacher than that she |\nlived what she taught.\nLong may Miss Coulling be spared I\nto bless this community, as a teacher,\nand in every other department of life |\nwhere mental attainment and real 1\nworth of character count for any?\nthing.\nWill Spend Summer Here.\nDr. Margaret Bowen, of R\'chmond,\nVa., will spend the months of July\nand August in Tazewell, and will\ntreat in the town of Tazewell during\nIbe time, Place of office announced\ntater,\nI 2, 1911\nLARGE CROWDS\nBMFLIGHTS\nBluefield\'s "Aviation Meet"\nWas All in Air?The Bird\nMen Couldn\'t Fly.\nThe aviation meet in Minefield \\vnn\nn great success.

Miss l,ou Coulling was re\nluested to meet a number of her\nfriends and pupils there, when she\nwas presented with a large, handsome\nl>oquet of llowcrs, in which was hid\niO\'l a handsome gift, a token of re\n{ard nnd appreciation from her pupils\n>f this session and of other sessions,\niccompaniud by a request that she\nipend the summer vacation in rest\nmd recreation. Miss Coulling was\nleeply touched by this unexpected\nixprossion of regard and appreciation\nThis action of her class and of mom\ntors of previous classes taught here,\n\'.as beautiful, a credit and hon\nhoy did themselves. Miss Coulling\nins taught in this town for years,\njuicily und unassuming, always nt\nicr posi and always measuring up.\n{he bus gone on, thinking, perhaps\ninly of her duty, nnd the work she\noves, concluding, no doubt, (if the\nbought entered her mind at all),that\nlomo dny, sooner or later, when she\nay in her casket, friends would bring\nicr flowers und tokens of their love\nmd regards for the elforts sho had\nnade through the years, to discharge\nicr dutcs, but, behold I hero comes\nho flowers, and here goes the news\ntaper notice and testimonial, while\nihe still lives, to sou and hour and\nippreciato.

And how much more useful\nve nil would he, too, if our friends\nind those for whom and to whom we\n;ive our very life, would give some\nixpression before we pnss beyond the\nloint of recognition ! Congrntulations,\nnont heartily, to Miss Coulling, and\no nil the favored few who do not\niced to "die to win."

This is\nibout the first instance reported\nwhere any clement whatsoever has\ngotten the better of a mule. Mat?\nthews is lucky in having the light\nling to etrike him instead of the\nmule kicking him. If that mule had\ngotten a whack at him he would have\nither things knocked off besides his\ndioes. However, he should be thank?\nful for his lucky escape. Singular it\nis and a pity, too, that you never\ntear of lightning striking a dog.\nTALKED WITH COL. MOSBY\nGeo. W.

While away he took\nin Roanoke, Washington, Baltimore\nand other places of interest, among\nthem being Corbett, just twenty\nmiles out from Baltimore, where Mr.\nand Mrs. E. V. Spotts live. Doak re-1\nports Ed getting on nicely in the |\nfeed and grain business, and Mrs.\nSpotts happy and contented keeping\nhouse. "My Lord" Spotts, "Big\nWill," had not yet reached Corbett\nand it was suggested that he must\nhave "walked through" and would\nreach home later. The Spotts\' are\nmissed here, and it is not much of a\nventure to say that they miss Taze?\nwell, too, during these hot days.\nMr. Doak had the pleasure of his\nlife in meeting Col. John S.

Our analogy\nbetween members joining a church\nand Republicans joining the Demo\nera lie party, we recognized at the\ntime, might be considered, technical?\nly a little far fetched. Reasoning by\nanalogy is always hazardous, and, as\nour distinguished contemporary Is\nwell aware, the points of an analogy\nshould never be pressed beyond the\nlegitimate, particular point aimed at\nin the illustration. What we meant to\nbring out, and what we still hold,\ntha* .... re must bo some one first\nvote. That if a man wants to vott\nthe Democratic ticket he should be\nallowed to do so at one time as well\nas at another. "If a man wants to\nvote in the Democratic primary, and\nunderstands and so declares, along\nwith all the rest of us, that he will\n(be expected to) support the ticket\nso nominated, at the polls in Novem?\nber, upon what grounds of reason\ncommon sense, should he be denied or\nkept out?" We requote the above ex?\ntract from our editorial as stating the\npoint as clearly as we can. We d\nnot see that our contemporary refuted\nthis position As to the church analogy\nbeing "most unfortunate," let\'s\nsec. The one act which constitutes\none a member of n church in this\ncountry, we believe, is baptism, and\na formal recognition follows. In most\nchurches it is a single net which\nmakes the applicant a member, and\nthat one act, say, is baptism, or con?\nfirmation, or what not. Candidates do\nnot join churches, generally, at\n"business meetings. " \'J hey present\nthemselves at the proper time and\nplace, having previously settled the\nquestion in their own minds, and if\notherwise worthy and acceptable are\nreceived. What makes a man a Dem\nocrat? Clearly a single act, that of\nvoting. Having previously decided\nand determined to become n Demo?\ncrat he presents himself at the door\n?the polls, signs the pledge, and\nasks to be admitted. What shall we\nsay to him? "Unless ycu have pre\nviously voted the ticket we can\'t ad\nmit you?" "But," says the candi\ndate, "I was converted only a few\ndays ago, or I have just become of\nvoting age since the last meeting\nand this is the first opportunity I\'ve\nhad, nnd I may not have another, and\n1 want to identify msyelf with you"\nWe contend, that to deny him the\nprivilege is denying him the only\nmeans by which he can ever become a\nmember of the party. A primary\nnot a private business meeting. It is\na meeting to obtain the will and wish\nof the whole people, to select a can?\ndidate to represent the entire people,\nand all the people should have a say\nso in the matter. Every meeting held\nby Democrats should be a meeting for\nthe reception of members. How about\nthe young men who have just become\nof voting age?\nNow all we contend for is,let every\nman vote who is quailfied. Let every\nman vote the Democratic ticket who\nwill, unless he be a trickster, who\nregards not his word and pledge, in\nwhich case he is not fit to vote any\nticket, not even a Republican ticket.\nWhether to "help Claude out" or to\n"help Carter in," makes no differ?\nence whatsoever with us. And. while\nwe are at it, is not this" help-Claude\nout" business the real milk in the\ncoacoanut, or rather, "the negro in\nthe woodpile?" How would our\nLynchburg contemporary feel about\nthis whole matter, if opening the\nprimary to Republicans would "help\nCarter out," instead of helping\nClaude out? As for us, wo believe\nthat opening the primary to Republi?\ncans in this, the Ninth District, if\nany difference, will nu "help Claude\nout," as Republicans are generally\nconstitutionally and otherwise, fer\nnent any measure which hears the\nirks of "the machine" upon it.\nNEAR POETRY AND PUNS\nThe Richmond Virginian refers to\nSenator Swansoh\'B followers aal\n"memhersof the Glass Cutters\' Un?\nion," and says that if it hears any\nmore protests from the Index-Appeal\nregarding murdering the language\nwith puns it will persuade the editor\nof the Newport News Times-Herald\nto dedicato to us one of his poems,\nsubject not stated. We feel no hesi?\ntancy in saying that a Times-Herald\npoem is much to bo preferred to a\nVirginian or Danville Register pun.\nAnd this is not saying anything es?\npecially complimentary of the poetry\n?Petersburg Index-Appeal.\nWe protest against being associat?\ned with such a punning novice as The\nVirignia. The paper is not yet eigh?\nteen months cdd and can only pun by\nlisping. As to the preference of the\nIndex-Appeal for Copelandesque poe?\ntry, we can only marvel at Editor\nHarris\' depraved taste. Our Peters?\nburg friend was formerly addicted to\nthe poetry habit himself, however,\nand it is probab\'y this fellow feeling\nthat makes him so wondronus kind.\nThere; we have betrayed our contem?\nporary and inadvertently exposed bis\nyouthful folly. He will like our puns\nless than ever now. Meanwhile wo\ncommend to Editor Harris a reading\nof those mnsterpieces of Editor Cope\nland\'s muse, entitled "Peyser\' \'end\n"The Knocker." They are worthy to\nbe embalmed in the Charlotte Ob?\nserver\'s collection of North Carolina\nnear-poetry products, which is the\nhighest praise. ? Danville Register.\nWe appreciate the graceful apology\nthe Register makes for The Virgin?\nian\'s puns. Our youth is sadly\nagainst us. There be some who fail\nto appreciate a joke until it is old\nenough to cut its wisdom teeth, and\namong such unappreciative folk we\nmust class those who prefer the\npoetic output of the bard of Hampton\nRoads to the gems which drop in such\nprofusion from the pen of the Regis?\nter.?The Virginian.\nWe olfer no apology for butting in?\nto this scrap. Such Stuff is clearly an\nIndex to the standing of the newspa?\npers in the broomsedge and peanut\ndistricts. We herein Register our\nprotest against imposing upon the\nreaders of these "big dailies," dur?\ning the heated term, and Appeal to\nthe sense of propriety of their edi?\ntors. Even a casual Observer can see\nthat the whole business] is a fake.\nWE ASK FOR LIGHT\nIn the respectful comment made by\nthe Lynchburg News on our editorial,\npublished elsewhere, occurs this\nparagraph :\n"We know that whatever the\nviews of our friend they are honestly\nconceived, honestly entertained and\nfearlessly expressed. With all the\nmore regret and concern therefore do\nwe now note that the Clinch Valley\nNews not only clearly apprehends the\ndirection in which Democratic politics\nin Virginia are drifting, but that it\nput-, in its oar to accelerate the move?\nment. \'\'\nUsually our distinguished contem?\nporary\'s English is sojtransparent and\nclear that it\'s meaning can be mis\ncontrued or misunderstood only by the\ndullest and most opaque skull. We\nconfess to being "thickheaded" as n\nnormal ? condition, and in this\ninstance fail to grasp. Does our\ncontempoary mean to say that, after\napprehending the dangerous drift "of\nDemocratic politics in Virginia" we\nhave deliberately put in our oar "to\naccelerate the movement" downward?\nWe confess that we do not much en?\njoy \'the apparent insinuation, that,\nafter clearly apprehending the wrong,\nwe have deliberately chosen to "ac?\ncelerate" the wrong. Hut perhaps we\ndo not grasp the meaning of the\n"mild impeachment" We seek the\nlight.\nNow, that the Presbyterian breth?\nren have disposed of the Rev, Dr.\nGarnet, Hampden Sidney is the next\npoint of investigation. Hampden Sid?\nney would have done well to have\ntaken the advice of the Clinch Valley\nNews, and pulled up sto.kes and fol?\nlowed her better half to Richmond\nwhen she had the opportunity. So,\nthere you are again. "We told you\nso." The Farmville Herald, publish?\ned hardby IL and S. doesn\'t seem to\nknow what the trouble is with "The\nOld Lady on The Hill." Those of us\nat a distance are not supposed to\nknow, of course. One thing we ven?\nture to assert, that there is too much\n"sporting blood" in some church\nschools we\'ve heard of. Club houses,\nballs, and other questionable worldly\ngaieties, mixed up with church\nschools, particulary theological\nschools, invariably bring trouble,\nsooner or later.\nIf the bird men want a cool, even,\nbracing, buoyant air to sail in they\nshould come to Tazewell, and stay\niway from Bristol, when the atmos?\nphere is so full of holes, swirls and\naanks of dirt that you cant tell one\nfrom the other in the daytime.\nWhy should it be thought a thing\nliscreditable or unwise or in anyway\n?vrong for a candidate to solicit the\ninfluence of*another in Iiis behalf?\nThey all ito it, and goodness knows,\nmany of them need all the help they\ncan obtain. j\nThe Farmville Herald has these\nlarge headlines: "Another Son of\nPrince Edward To The Front."\nTazewell boys aie always to "the\nfront" in numbers too large to count.\nIt is to be hoped that Judge Martin\nWilliams will have better luck with\nhis pure elecltion bill in the next\nHouse than he has had with his\nWharton Insurance law.\nThese be tho days when golf, lawn\ntennis, base ball and such athletic\nsports are proven to be far b-ss irk?\nsome than hoeing in tho garden.\nThe Viewpoint of the Other Side\n|I,ynchhurg News.]\nThe News\' position with reference\nto various questions involved in the\npresent senatorial campaign has been\nrepeatedly stated and emphasized. We\nhave been especially explicit and pro?\nnounced in outlining objections to the\nplan involving Republican participa?\ntion in Democratic primaries, which\nthe State Democratic Committee has\nrecently refused to prohibit,"and also\nin taking stand against machine con?\ntrol of the Democratic party. Amaze?\nment having been expressed by some\nof our friends at the present tim of\naffairs in the Democratic party, The\nNews has been at pains to p-osent\nthe views of those who stand for\nthese conditi-ns, and who argue to\nsustain them? this largely for tin\npurpose of clearly developing the act?\nual and sympathetic viewpoint of the\n"other side," and thus enable the\npublic to the better understand what\nis to lie attempted in the primary\nelection next fall. We have repro?\nduced, for example, a lengthy editor?\nial from the Danville Register on\nthe subject of permitting Republicans\nto take part in Democratic primaries.\nWe have also twice published an ed?\nitorial from the Koanoke News en?\ndorsed by the Koanoke Times in\nwhich the famous statement was\nmade that the Republicans of the\nFifth would like to "Help ("laude\nOut" in the approaching Democratic\nsenatorial primary. These two news?\npapers are the leading Martin and\nSwanson advocates in the State. In\norder to further enlighten our readers\nas to the manner in which the action\nof tho State Committee is viewed and\nconstrued by these with whom we\nhave the misfortune to disagree, we\ntoday present for their consideration\ntwo editorials taken from the Clinch\nValley News. Our Clinch Valley con?\ntemporary is published at Tazewell.\nIt is an able and influential newspa?\nper, both for it, and for the es?\ntimable gentlemen who control and\ndirect it, we entertain high respect\nand high regard. No amount of differ?\nence in opinion between that journal\nand ourselves could abate the very\ncordial esteem in which we hold it.\nWe know that whatever the views of\nour friend they are honestly conceiv?\ned, honestly entertained and fearless?\nly expressed. With all the more re?\ngret and concern therefore do we now\nnote that the Clinch Valley News\nnot only clearly apprehends the direc?\ntion in which Democratic politics in\nVirginia arc drifting, but that it puts\nin its oar to accelerate the movement.\nIn its issue of Friday that newspaper\nsays:\n"LET THE REPUBLICANS COME\nIN.\n"If a man presents himself for\nmembership in a church he is not\ncompelled to prove that he was con?\nverted to the faith twelve months,\nsix months, or even six hours pre?\nviously. His word is taken. He is ad?\nmitted, promising to do the best he\ncan in the future to live up to and\nfaithfully perform the duties of his\nnew relationship. And this is sensible\nand correct. There would be no sense\nor reason, it seems to us. in turning\nan applicant down because of the re?\ncent date of his conversion, unless his\npast record had been such as to make\nhim an undesirable member. Is not\nthe principle about the same, which\nwould prohibit a Republican from\nvoting in a Democratic primary for\nthe reason that he did not vote the\nDemocraic ticket at the preceding\nelection? If a man wants to vote in\nthe Deomcratic primary, and under?\nstands and so declares along with all\nthe rest of us, that he will support\nthe ticket so nominated, at the polls\nin November, upon what grounds of\nreason or common sense, should he be\ndenied or kept out? Such a policy is\na declaration virtually, that the Dem?\nocratic party in the State wants no\nrecruits or growth. It seems to us\nthat the State committee was wise in\nrefusing ti prohibit Republicans who\npledge themlselves to vote the ticket\nnominated, from voting in the Sep?\ntember primarvy. The history of re?\ncent campaigns shows that a latge\nnumber of Republicans have been de?\nserting the ranks of the old party,\nand let nothing be thrown in their\nway?no stumbling blocks. The mis?\nsion of the Democraits is to sinners\nas well, and for goodness sake, if the\nsinners have repented and want to\ncome, give them the glad hand."\nIt seems to us that answer to the\nnbove is too obvious to require stat?\ning. Certainly the church analogy is\n?nost unfortunate for its projector.\nA pastor calling a meeting of mem\nires of his congregation to settle a\nmatter of church concern, would not\ninclude those who were not members\nthereof, although they might promise\n:o become members at some future\n;Ime. There is a certain ntoce and\ncertain periods ullixcil at which con-j\nversions may he expressed, and mem-I\nberahip in congregation does not be\ngi.i until at such place nnd period the\nformal act of joining the church is\nwitnessed, und not until then do the\nrights of membership accrue. So with\na political party. The primary is a\nsort of congregation of party mem?\nbers. It should include only party\nmebmera and not until the Republi?\ncan formally joins the party by vot?\ning the Democratic ticket, should he\nbe regarded as co-equal in party\nrights with the regular members of\nthe Democratic party.\n1 The second editorial appearing in\nthe latest issue of the Clinch Valley\nNews, has to do with the machine\nmethods in Virginia. Here it is:\n"Congressman Jones has made the\ncharge that the judiciary of the!\nState -mots of them\'?hold their\npresent places by the will of Senator\nThomas Staples Martin. For our part,\nwe do not very much care whether\nthis charge is true or false, inasmuch\nas the coterie of judges from the\nCourt of Appeals d. wn to Judge Keg\nley, of Tazewell, are all, generally\nspeaking, first class men, proving\nthat the "Ross" is pre-eminently\nfitted for the job of selecting judges.\nAs this paper said some time ago,\nabout the "machine," and the State\ngovernment being run from Washing?\nton, if this be the case it speaks vol?\numes in praises of the wisdom and\ngood judgment of the powers that be,\nfor everyting is moving along finely\nin the State?roads,education,schools,\npensions, charitable institutions, etc.,\nand, as we said before, it strikes us,\nthat if it were contended that Messrs.\nMartin and Swanson had nothing\nwhatsoever to do with the present\ncondition of things?appointment of\njudges included the discounting of\nthese gentlemen would be an easier\ntask. However, the charge has been\nmade that candidates for appointment\nto the judiciary of the State must\nbend the knee to Moss Martin and no\nnames given or specifications made.\nHow are we to get at the facts?\nHither Mi. Jones or the judges them?\nselves must give the facts. If it is a\ncrime to secure the inlluence of Mr.\nMartin for election or appointment to\noffice let the criminal he pointed out,\nnnd the skirts of every innocent man\ncleared. Let the roll be called."\nWe submit the above without com?\nment other than to bespeak for it a\ncareful reading. Just now we are es?\npecially anxious for the Democratic\nelectorate to understand from what\nquaiters? from the friends of what\nI Senatorial aspirants, these remark?\nable and to our mind revolutionary\ndoctrines are proceeding.-?\'Lynch\nburg News.\nSaved His Wifo\'s Life\n"Tiiy wife would have been in her\ngrave today," writes O, II. mown, of\nMuscadine, Ala .

C. Graham, of Tazewell,\nVa., died at her home in Tazewell,\nApril 21, 1911.\nIn the death of Mrs. Graham the\nChurch loses a devoted, active, earnest\ndaughter and the State is deprived of\na woman representing the best type\nof high-bred, high-spirited, pure and\nuseful Virginia womanhood. Her am?\nbitions were to be useful, to be true,\nto live faithful to the traditions of\nher people. The splendid old motto;\n"1 serve," was hers through life;\nin her own family, as wife nnd\nmother and queen of her household,\nand as a potent force in such activi?\nties for the public welfare ns became\nher station nnd her modesty. To her\nhusband she was a loyal und dutiful\nwife, and affectionate, happy-hearted\ncomrnde. To her family she was a\nguarding, tender, watchful guide. To\nall about her, in her winter home in\nFlorida, in her summer home in Tnze\nwell, she was friend and hepler. The\nhumblest knew her rendy bounty and\nquick sympathy nnd practical aid in\ntheir troubles and distress. The high?\nest recognized in her not only an\nequal but u leader in all that tended\nto enliven and beautify social life, in\nevery undertaking for tho general\ngood; and an unfailing comforter\nand source of strength in time of sor?\nrow and disaster.\nShe was born in Chesterfield coun?\nty, Va., September 23, 1862. Her\nfather was Capt. Henry W. Cox, of\nthe Confederate Army, and her\nmother, Marthu H. Woolridge. She\nwas of pure Chesterfield county\nstock, all her people except her pa?\nternal great grandfather having been\nnatives and residents of that county\nsince its first settlement in t\'.e early\nColonial days. Her father\'s parents\nwere Judge James H. Cox, one of the\nmost distinguished jurists of the\nState, and Martha Heid Law; her\ngrandmother\'s father being William\nParran Law, born in Euglnnd. Her\nmother\'s parents were Daniel Spen?\ncer Woolridge and Minerva Archer\nCox. She was descended from Ben?\njamin Witkins and nearly related to\nArchibald Cary, both representatives\nfrom Chesterfield in the Virginia\nC .uvention of 177G.\nMrs. Crnham, after the death of\nher mother in 1871, lived with her\ngrandfather, Mr. Woolridge, and her\naunt, Mrs. T M. Logan, wife of\nGeneral T M. Logan, then of Rich?\nmond, nnd in 1878 went to the Edge\nHill School, near Charlottesville, con?\nducted by the Misses Randolph,\nwhere, because of trouble with her\neyes, it was necessary for her to\nhave her reasons rend to her; hut not?\nwithstanding this disadvantage her\nretentive memory and nctive and\nstrong mind enabled her to be first in\nher classes. In 1887 she spent sev?\neral months in Europe and in 1889\n90 she lived there, completing by\ntravel, observation and contact with\nripened culture of the old countries\nthe broad, comprehensive education\nfor which such excellent foundation\nhad been laid. She acquired accurate\nknowledge of French and German nnd\nready access to the literature and\nlearning of those lunguages which\nshe utilized with thoroughness and\ndiscrimination.\nJune 21, 1898, she was married at\nthe summer home of General Logan,\nin Buckingham county, to Judge S.C.\nGraham, of Tazewell. She had be?\ncome a communicant of the Episcopal\nChurch in 1881.\nAlways she had been a busy and\nhappy girl and woman. With her new\nsurroundings and opportunities her\nlife broadened and became brighter\nthan ever. Born of long lines of peo?\nple representing the highest there\nwas of intellect and culture and social\ngraces, and with her own exceptional\nadvantages and acquirements, she\nwas equipped fully to be an influence\nand useful in many directions. She\nwas one of those who could move\nthrough life happily and cheerfully,\nwith instinctive tact avoiding its en?\ntanglements and unnecessary annoy?\nances, while ready to face issues\nwhen they arose with the dauntless\ncourage and the fidelity to her ideals\nand her codes that she inherited.\nHer religion was of the kind that\nmakes itself felt continually and does\nnot need to be proclaimed. She hated\ncant and loved real righteousness and\ntruth and purity, and in her life il?\nlustrated them. She could and did\ncome in contact with men and women\nof many different kinds and take en?\nergetic and pleasant part in all the\naffairs of life and the world, dissemi?\nnating the sunshine from her own\nsoul and the delicate odor of her own\nvirtues and taking no stain.\nShe was a member of the Colonial\nDames and especially active in the\nDaughters of the Confederacy, but\nthese were but small parts, compara?\ntively, of the interests that attracted\nher ceaseless, dynamic energies of\nmind and body?energies, which\nnever spared or restrained, probably\ncaused her death in the midst of her\nhappiness and usefulnhcss. She shun?\nned no task and to the last proved\nherself equal to every demand. Bril?\nliant, of unfailing resources, a schol?\nar of the classics and of contempora?\nneous thought and literature, she\nshone in any company; and as hostess\nin, the conduct of her own household,\nas taking her part in public affairs,\nin church work and in the application\nof her endless charity, she met any\nemergency smiling, bright and com?\npetent. She loved her family, her\nI Church, her State and people and to\nall of them was intensey loyal and\nj devoted?a strong, pious, splendid\nVirginia gentlewoman, true to the\ni recoids of her race.\n. She was buried at Tazewell, in the\n\' Jeffersanville Cemetery, on April\n22nd,Jtlie services of the Church,\n? -\nbeing conducted by tho Rev,. C. W. J\nSydnor.

Bush, the president of tho Missou?\nri Pacific Railway, is attracting much\nattention in the West, which, judg?\ning from press reports, fnds in him\na new sort of railroad chief executive\n?one who, according to public esti?\nmation will "make good." He is pro?\nnounced for friendly relations be?\ntween his company and the public,\nsaying that such harmony must be\nestablished preliminary to fulfilling\nthe task before him?the building up\nof the great system of which he has\njust become the official head, nfter n\nmost successful term ns president of\nthe Western Maryland. He is quoted\nas saying: "The railroads are neces?\nsary to the public good, and the peo?\nple and the railroads ought to be\nfriendly;" also, "The first thing is\nto know that the people will not lie\ntoo hard on us, und that the investors\nwill get their money back with a rea?\nsonable addition.\'\'\nMr. Hush puts the situation tersely,\nand with force. What he says is\ntrue, and the people generally know\nit is the fact, but it is another thing\nto check demagogues who start upon\ncampaigns of railroad baiting for the\npurpose of currying favor with voters\nwho mny not renlizc the position of\nthe companies with respect to financ?\ning improvements and extensions. In\nsome parts of the country the people\nnnd their representatives have attain?\ned a realization of the truth, and\nwholesale attacks upon the transpor\ntion companies have ceased, with the\nconsequence that capital, which is al?\nways timid, has been renssured, and\nis now finding investment there; hut\nin other place.; exactly contrary con?\nditions exist, nnd it remain.i difficult\nto finance railroad enterprises.\nIt is must regrettable that in some\nfew states such apparent hostility to\nrailroad companies should continue.\nEvery year that new lines and im?\nprovement are delayed scores a dis?\ntinct loss to the section of country in\nwhich they nre needed, but the loss\ncannot be measured by any pnrt of\ntime; it is incalculable. A year\'s de?\nlay in the building of a needed rail?\nroad may mean a five or ten year set?\nback for the region which it would\ntraverse. Immigration and settlement\nmay be turned to other section, where\nmore liberal ideas prevail concerning\ntransportation enterprises, with the\nresult that they are nettled and made\nmany times more valunble, while the\nothers remain in stntu quo, or they\nmay even recede; surely, ns compared\nwith the newly-settled sections, they\nare at n much greater advantage\nthan they were previously.\nThere will be a vast deal of new\nrailroad required in this country, es?\npecially in the South and Southwest,\nwithin the next five or ten years, and\nclearheaded, progressive men like Mr.\nHush will do all they can to \'establish\nconditions favorable for securing such\nresults. They will seek harmony first\nto get doyyn to an understanding?a\nworking basis?with the people, so\nthat their work may proceed without\nhindrance.Conflicts are to be avoided.\nEvery good business man knows this,\nand will go out of his way to escape\nthem. They are consumers of time,\nenergy and money, and when ended\nusally leave little, if any, gain to\neither side. The wise man in the\nworkaaay world of affairs is an apos?\ntle of peace, because he has neither\ntime nor money to wasto in fights\nwhich profit him naught.\nYour Neighbors Experience.\nAow you may profit by It, Tako Foley\nKidney Pills.

E.\nJackson.\nThe Month-old Chick\nChicks that are three or four weeks\nold, while past the critical stage of\ntheir existence, are not yet raised by\nany means. Many people look after\nt\'eir chicks pretty carefully until\nthey are really safe from "infantile"\ndisorders which are always liable to\ncreate havoc in the flock.\nIn the first place, see that the\nchicks get plenty to eat. After they\nare three or four weeks old, chicks\ncan scarcely cat too much, providing\nthe food provided for them is of the\nright kind. As a rule, the more the\nchicks eat the faster and the better\nwill they develop, although of course\nthey must receive only wholesome.\nfoods und no "slops," etc. Variety\nin feeding is essential, and as ninny i\ndill\'ernt kinds of grain us possible\'\nshould be provided.\nSupply meat nnd green food fre- ;\nquently, in addition to the grain feed. \'\nIf possible, it is always well to give\nthe chicks constant access to both\nmeat and greens. They will not eat\ntoo much if they are accustomed to it\ngradually; otherwise, they are liable\nto overeat at first, for green, uny\nkind of vegetables or grasses that the\nbirds will eat with relish will be good\nfor them. For animal food, green\ncut bone or ground beef scraps are\nprobably best. Between theso two,\none is about ns good ns the othor, do- ]\npending upon locul markets as to\nwhich one can be secured most cheap- |\niy.\nOf course, cleanliness nnd proper\nsanitation are important. Tho coops\nand brooders must be kept scrupulous?\nly clean and free from filth. (\'hicks!\ncan not thrive in n filthy, foul-smell-1\ning atmosphere, to say nothing of\nthe harbor such a place affords for the\nbreeding of disease germs, lice and\nmites, etc.\nVermin must bo closely guarded\nagainst. If neglected, they often\ncause more trouble und loss among\nmonth old chicks than any other\ncause. Use insect powder on the\nbodies of the chicks to kill the body\nlice. Spray or plant the coops with\ncoal oil or with liquid lice killer to\nexterminate the red mites or lice\nwhich infest the coops.?-Agricultural\nBpitomist.\nA. Leading California Druggist\nPasadena.
