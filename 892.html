        <pre>['302 CURRENT HISTORY, MAY, 1926\nsions of engineers left for Germany, \nFrance and the United States during the \nfollowing week to study hydroelectric \nplants, gram elevators, transloading equip\xad\nment, general engineering methods and ma\xad\nchinery. Seeking foreign capital to de\xad\nvelop Russia’s natural resources and to pro\xad\nvide revenues for the Government as well, \nthe Soviet authorities have granted conces\xad\nsions to Japanese and British companies. \nA provisional agreement has been signed \nwith a group of Japanese timber com\xad\npanies for the exploitation of 5,000,000 \nacres in the maritime province of Eastern \nSiberia. The Japanese are to enjoy tim\xad\nber rights, including the manufacture of \npaper pulp, for fort)-five years. They are \nto pay the Soviet Government a tax of 25 \nper cent, on all timber exported from the \nregion. A British company has been given \nrights for thirty-six years to mine silver, \nlead and iron near the Amur River. The \ncompany must spend 8200,000 on explora\xad\ntion during the first three years and sell \nthe entire output of the mines in its con\xad\ncession to the Soviet Government if it \nwishes to buy. An agreement has been \nconcluded between the Soviet Government \nand the Cunard and Holland-America ship\xad\nping companies with regard to traffic on \nthe Volga River and its tributaries. The \nGovernment is to contribute the entire com\xad\nmercial fleet on those rivers with all \nwharves, quays and shipyards. The com\xad\npanies on their part are to supply capital \nof equal value, "\'hey are to have a mo\xad\nnopoly of freight and passenger traffic \nand entire control over the operation of \nthe river lines. The Government is to have \nno voice in the employment or discharge \nof personnel. Proceeds are to be shared \nequally between the Government and the \nCunard and Holland-America companies. \nIt is claimed that the freedom with respect\nto personnel granted to the shipping com\xad\npanies is a new departure in Soviet policy.\nThe authorities at Moscow are alert to \npossibilities for increasing or saving reve\xad\nnues. Several vacant palaces in Lenin\xad\ngrad, once the property of the Czar or \nmembers of his family, have been offered \nto Americans or other foreigners to pur\xad\nchase or to lease for periods from twenty- \nfive to fifty years. The conditions in any \ncase are that the buildings be put in good \ncondition and that customary taxes be paid. \nThe Government has announced that it will \nmanufacture 500,000.000 quarts of vodka \nin the coming year to produce a revenue \nfor the State of approximately 8250,000.- \n000, about 10 per cent, of its entire budget. \nVodka, as now produced by the Govern\xad\nment, is 40 per cent, alcohol. Its selling \nprice is 90 cents a quart. To save money, \nthe Government has issued a decree against, \nuseless advertising by State trusts, especial\xad\nly by those which are unable to supply \nthe demand for the goods which they \nhandle. It seems that Government institu\xad\ntions spent more than 21,000,000 rubles \nlast year on advertising.\nDistressed by the sorry spectacle of their \ncourts, the Soviet authorities four months \nago brought ninety-six Soviet Judges, law\xad\nyers and others to trial at Kharkov. On \nMarch 2 seventy of them were sentenced to \nprison. No death penalties were exacted. \nClemency was given on the ground that the \naccused were members of the proletariat. \nThe Court deliberated eleven days over a \nrecord of illiteracy, incompetence, bribery \nand corruption. One Demchenko was the \nmost prominent person condemned. He \nhad won the name, “ King of Liberators,”  \nfor he seemed able to gain freedom for \nany one who could pay his price. Dem\xad\nchenko received the maximum sentence of \nten years in prison.\nNATIONS OF NORTH ERN EUROPE\nLatvia\nrPHE authorities at Riga learned on March \n11 that Soviet police had arrested the \nLatvian Vice Consul at Leningrad on the \ncharge of espionage, presumably in retalia\xad\ntion for the arrest of an official of the \nSoviet consulate in Riga by Latvian police, \non a similar charge.\nLithuania\nTI> EFUSING to have direct dealings with \nPolish representatives, the Lithuanian \nRailwav Directorate secured a settlement\nconcerning the use of railway cars by nego\xad\ntiating through the German Central Rail\xad\nway Board. Identic texts of an agreement \nwere signed by Lithuanians with the Ger\xad\n', "NATIONS OF NORTHERN EUROPE 303\nman representatives and by Poles with the \nGermans. For their mediation the Ger\xad\nmans received percentages of amounts pay\xad\nable by the parties concerned. Lithuania \nthus reached an understanding with Poland, \nbut clung to its profession that it would \nhave nothing to do with Poland.\nSince the establishment of new tariffs, \nLithuania’s imports have declined so that \nin January exports exceeded imports by\n6,800,000 litas. The imports of January, \n1926, fell behind the imports of January, \n1925, some 3,200,000 litas.\nUpon receipt of a request from the Pres\xad\nident of the Council of the League of Na\xad\ntions, the Lithuanian Government suspend\xad\ned operations against the Polish frontier \nguards who had invaded Lithuanian terri\xad\ntory on Feb. 22. Declaring, however, that \nthe Poles were still remaining on Lithua\xad\nnian territory and were mistreating eight \nLithuanian guards taken prisoner, the Lith\xad\nuanian Government addressed a note of \nprotest to the British Foreign Office.\nEstonia\n/■'OFFICIALS viewed the trade balance in \n1925 of 10,000,000 Estonian marks, \nart excess of exports over imports, as the \nresult of rapid agricultural development. \nWhereas in 1924 first place among exports \nwas held by textile products, in 1925 food\xad\nstuffs took the lead— dairy products con\xad\nstituting 25.9 per cent, o f all exports.\nThe debt to France, incurred during the \nwar for independence from Russia in 1918- \n1919, amounted to 13,000,000 francs. Th~ \nlast instalment of 1.800,000 francs was paid \nin Paris at the end of last year.\nA. B.

Such was the declara\xad\ntion of the Prime Minister, General \nPrimo de Rivera, in an interview in the \njo u rn a l E l  D e b a t e .

He considered the situa\xad\ntion in Morocco to be satisfactory in \nall respects: “ Spain and France will again \ncollaborate in military operations against \nthe rebels. Abd-el-Krim, seeing the hand\xad\nwriting on the wall, is now anxious to ac\xad\ncept any kind of peace.”\nThe Premier further stated:\nThe Government has decided upon rigorous \neconomies in expenditures and the elimination of \nall waste. We shall continue to spend money \non the restoration and preservation of our na\xad\ntional artistic treasures to prevent their decay and\ndisappearance. More highways will be constructed \nto attract tourists. The principle governing my \nviews on economies is to do away with unneces\xad\nsary salaries yet to pay those deserving of com\xad\npensation in lull.\nThe permanence of the Government is for an \nindefinite time, since the country desires no \npolitical changes. For the next ten months there \ncannot be any talk of collective assemblies or \nother constitutional changes, which will happen \nonly after all other more urgent problems have \nbeen solved.\nThe General said further that the Govern\xad\nment was not thinking of increasing the \nremuneration of the clergy, and added: “ I \nbelieve that the Catholics of Spain must \nimprove the situation prevailing in their \nchurches and the living conditions of their \npriests, just as it is being done by Catholics \nin other countries.”\nThe conflict between the Spanish Govern\xad\n"]</pre>
