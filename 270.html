During the\nyear, according to figures that mainly |\nare from Inside sources, the bullion \'\nproduct closely approximated 241,400.\n000 pounds. In 1904 the production\nwas about 205,000,000 pounds, worth\n$30,000,000. In 1903 the production\nwas about 203,000,000 pounds, worth\nat that time about $28,000,000. The\nproduction increase has come largely\nthrough the operation of the great new\nCopper Queen smelter at Douglas,\nthough the Old Dominion and United\nVerde furnaces each did 10,000,000\npounds better than in 1904, and the\nCalumet and Arizona at Douglas ad\nvanced 4,000,000 pounds. Owing to\nfloods, the production of the Arizona\nCopper Company and the Detroit Cop\nper Company dropped off materially.\nThe Shannon appears to have held its\nown. The copper bullion product for\n1905 will be found practically as fol\nlows:\nPounds.\nCopper Queen, Bisbee . 60,000,000\nDetroit Copper, Morenci.... 15,000,000\nOld Dominion (inc.

Equator,) Jer\nome . 40,000,000\nOre shipments to outside smelters\n. 4,000,000\nTotal for year .241.400,000\nIt will be noted that the Phelps\nDodge properties (Copper Queen, De\ntroit, Old Dominion-United Globe and\nMoctezuma.) produced more than 46\nper cent, of the total. The company\'s\nCopper Queen smelter at Douglas is\nthe greatest in the Southwest and is\nbeing added to continually. Already\nit has equipment for handling 300 tons\nof ore a day. though it Is run at only\nabout two-thirds its capacity. As has\nbeen the custom in previous years,\nthe Nacozari output is included in the\nfigures for Arizona. This output. In\nthe *shape of highly sulphuretic con\ncentrates, valuable for mixing with\ncarbonate ores, is shipped to the Doug\nlas and Globe smelters. The shipped\nores noted in the production table\nhave gone to smelters at El Paso and\nin Colorado from the Clifton district,\nfrom Globe, from the Superior mine in\nPinal county, from the Dragoon Moun\ntains of Cochise county, from mines in\nSanta Cruz county, from the Brad\nshaw Mountains near Prescott and\nfrom the Grand Canon district. In\nthe estimate also is included matter\nfrom a smelter that has been operat\ned somewhat on the northern side of\nthe Grand Canon.\nThere is little doubt, if the price of\ncopper holds up. that the bullion pro\nduction of Arizona will be fully 25\nper cent, greater in 1905. The Detroit\nand Arizona Copper companies, which\nhave mountains of low-grade ores, are\ndoubling their concentrator capacities.\nThe Shannon lately installed convert\ners. saving transportation of matte of\nthe Arizona Copper Company’s smel\nter. The Globe smelter, one of the\nbest in existence, has been in opera\ntion only a part of the year and is\ncapable of 50 per cent, greater out\nput. A concentrating mill and fur\nnace, with initial capacity of 300 torn\na day, will be built by the Imperial\nCompany at Silver Bell, Pima county,\nthus trebling its bullion product. A\ntew furnace was added lately to the\nCalumet and Arizona smelter at Doug\nlas, and its greater neighbor, the Cop\nper Queen, is capable of doing far\nmore than during the past year even\nwith its present equipment. Improve\nments now being made at the United\nVerde smelter will permit fully 50,\n000.000 pounds of copper product in\n1906. At Val Verde, in Big Bug dis\ntrict, south of Prescott, about Jan\nuary 1 will be “blown in" a great cus\ntom smelter, handling, besides silver\nand gold, about 300 tons of copper ore\na day. In the same vicinity the Tread\nwell smelter Is showing signs of re\nnewed activity.\nThis shows enormous smelting ca\npacity, but there is no doubt of the\nability of the copper mines to keep\nthe furnaces well supplied with ore.\nIt is probable that the close of 1906\nwill find Arizona leading the world In\nthe production of copper.\nCOLLECTOR UNDER INVESTIGA\nTION.\nGovernment Takes a Hand in Affairs\nof Custom Official.\nPortland.—As a result of a charge of\nofficial misconduct tiled against Wal\nter L. Robb, Collector of Customs at\nAstoria, and several of his subordin\nates, an investigation of the office has\nbeen made by order of the Secretary\nof the Treasury and the report of\nSpecial Agent Rice is now on the way\nto Washington. While the integrity of\nCollector is not questioned, it is al\nleged that politics has played too large\na part in the conduct of his office, and\nit is also charged that the revenue\nlaunch Patrol has been used on a num\nber of occasions by the Collector aud\nhis chief deputy, Frank L. Parker, for\nprivate purposes and for the enter\ntainment of friends and visitors.\nNEVADA MECCA OF ALL PROSPEC\nTORS.\nMany Reasons Why the Battle Born\nState Offers the Best Oppor\ntunities.\nSearchlight. Nev. — The question\nhaving been asked: "Where in the\nwestern states is at present the best\nplace to prospect during the next three\nmonths?" •Concentrate*\' writing In\nthe Mining and Scientific Press, would\nsuggest that southern Nevada atrl\nnorthwestern Arizona and Southern\nCalifornia at present offer the best in\nducements to the prospector, for sev\neral reasons. First, there is a large\narea in the desert region not\nthoroughly prospected, owing to dif-\'\nAcuities of transportation, ami srarcity\nof water; the former is. however, being\nsimpliAed by the construction of rail\nroads. and the establishment of near\ntown1- and mining ramps in that region\nfrom which the prospector may radigte\nwith more safety than heretofore.\nSecond, the ores are often high grade\nand ran be, shipped to distant points\nfor reduction, rendering mills reduc\ntion works unnecessary. Third, any\npromising prospect in the district\nabove referred to could readily be sold\nat a proper price, owing to the un\nusual interest at present being taken\nin ihe mining industry here.\nFourth, it is the best part of the\nyear to prospect in the desert, the\nweather being Ane and water trore\nabundant than during the summer\nmonths. OutAts can be bought a*\nany of the larger towns in the region\nwhich relieves the prospector of the\nnecessity of packing tools, provisions,\netc.—The Searchlight.\nPLAN FOR SEEING AMERICA.\nCommittee Appointed to Take Charge\nof Tours Through This\nCountry.\nSalt I^ake City.—In charge of the\npropaganda for increasiig the popu\nlarity of American sightseeing tours\nwill be, during the coming year, Rob\nert L.

One is known as\nthe Rye Patch road, which is forty -\nsix miles long and fair traveling for\nlight loads; the other is known as the\nSan Antonio road and is ten miles\nlonger, but better suited for heavy\nloads. Both roads just now present\na remarkable picture, for scenes are\nbeing enacted which seem possible\nnowhere else but in Nevada. The\nminers anti prospectors of the Rockies\nand Sierra Nevadas are on a rush to\na new and wonderful gold discovery.\nIt will surprise many to learn that\nManhattan was discovered last April.\nSoon thereafter it commenced to at\ntract attention, but it has only been\nwithin the last month that many min\ners headed that way. Then the ex\ncitement commenced to grow, until\nsuddenly, within the last week, the\nrush began. Tonopah being the near\nest settlement, felt the effect first,\nwhen all the idle camp followers from\nthere started. Then Goldfield caught\nthe fever, and now the whole southern\npart of the state has risen and the\nroads leading in the direction of Man\nhattan are burdened with all the mis\ncellaneous paraphernalia of frontier\nmining life.\nA low estimate places the exodus to\nthe new fields from Goldfield alone\nat 2,000 persons.\nTwo hundred dollars a day has been \'\nbid for automobiles by those anxious\nto reach the camp in a hurry. Hun\ndreds of teams line the two roads to\nthe latest camp.\nThe life at the new camp is stren\nuous. There is no law or order.\nLots have jumped in price from $25 to\n$3,500. Meats are very high.

It should add diversity to\nhis table and be primarily of pse rath\ner than profit. Earliness. productive\nness and shipping quality, which are\nso important in the case of the market\ngardener, are of less importance with\nthe farmer than suitability to his per\nsonal tastes. The farmer should grow\nthe vegetable he likes and should pro\nvide these in abundance.\nThe garden should be located near\nthe house. To be at their best, moat\nvegetables should be used very soon\nafter they are gathered. The garden\nwill be appreciated most if it is not far\nfrom the kitchen, not only because the\nvegetables may be used fresher, but\nalso because the products of the gar\n1 den will enter more largely into the\ndaily bill of fare, if they are within\neasy reach.\nTrimming The Trees.\nAlthough it is too early for a gen\nera! pruning of the citrus orchard\nwhere it may not have been previously\ntrained up in the way it should go,\nyet it is a good time to cut off all\nslender growth that may have been\ni nipped by the frost both on account\nof looks and for the good of the tree\n! itself. Every twig should be cut off\nto where the wood shows perfectly\nsound. It is also as good a time as\nany while going over the orchard to\n1 look into the interior of the trees and\n\' remove all dead growth. Many of the\nsmaller twigs that performed a useful\nfnction in the growth of the tree have\nbeen entirely superseded by a newer\nand thriftier growth, the result of\nwhich is many of the small twigs in\nside are dead. They are doing no\ngood now in the tree and are harbors\nfor spider webs, dead leaves, dust and\nother forms of rubbish. They also\nimpede a free circulation of air, which,\nwhen dry and hot in the late summer,\nis unfavorable to the spread of black\nJ scale and other forms of parasitical in\nI sects. These dead twigs are no indi\nI cation of an unhealthy condition of.\nI the tree, but are natural to a more\nadvanced stage of tree growth. Their\nremoval will also facilitate spraying,\n1 should such an undesirable contingency\n| arise. Time spent now at this leisure\nI time of the year will be very profit\nably spent, and may even tend to an\nincreased crop of fruit which will\nhave a better chance for early ma\nturity.—Cal. Cultivator.\nOnion Seed.\nSeed should be purchased from re\nliable firms, even though it may cost\nmore, for it always pays to get good\n| fresh seed. Cheap onion seed is liable\nto be poor and may mean mixed var\niety. lack of uniformity in crop, or\nthe production of scullions. Farmers\nand gardners frequently buy their\nseed in the small packets which are\nsold at the local country stores. . This\nis not a good practice, as such seed\nI is slow to germinate and the little\nplants are delicate and slender-rooted\nat first. The fresher and more vigo\nrous the seed, the better the germina\ntion and the stronger the plants. The\ngerminative vitality of onion seed de\ncreases quite rapidly with age.\nHog Raising.\nA line of livestock work that is\nclosely allied to dairying is hog rais\ning. The value of swine in our State\nis about $4,000,000. Of these animals\nabout one-third are raised on dairies.\nAlfalfa makes a good feed for sows as\nwell as for cows, and there is no better\nfeed for pigs than the dairy bypro\nducts. Yet we do not raise enough\npork to supply our people. Every\nyear about 10,000.000 pounds of pork\nproducts are brought into San Fran\ncisco alone. Perhaps not all of this\nremains in the State, but it doesn\'t\nmake any difference whether we con\nsume all the products that is brought\ninto the State or whether it is shipped\nto the Far East. If it is shipped, then\nwe are to blame for not securing that\nexport trade ourselves.—E. W. Ma\njors.\nWorth the Cost.\nThe best friends of the rural mail\nservice are the women. They derive\nboth benefit and pleasure from it and\nwhen it is permitted to carry parcels\nunder a parcels post law it will be\nan invaluable help to farmer’s wives\nwho will use it for half of the neces\nsities the home demands.\nThe Farm and Floral World is right\non this subject when it says:\n"The rural mail service is well worth\nall that it costs and its extension should\nbe hastened as circumstances will per\nmit. The initial cost of establishing\nnew routes will continue to be a drain\non the postal revenues, perhaps, but\nnecessity of national development, the\nrural free extension cannot be ques\ntioned. As a means of na\'ional edu\ncation and of delivery has proved its\nvalue, and as the system grows it will\nbecome more nearly self-supporting;\nand should the parcels post be estab\nlished, it will be fully so. Indirectly,\nthe service benefits trade by bringing\nthe country into easy communication\nwith the towns and cities, and it does\na great service by increasing enlight\nenment. comfort and contentment in\nrural districts.\n^^^GHTING PEAR BLIGHT. |\n^^fermination of the Peet In Cali\nW fornia ia Begun by Hor\nticulturists.\nSacramento—The extermination of\npear blight in the orchards of Calif0r.\nnia has commence# wit% Sacramento\nas the canter of operations.

A few days after his ar\nrival Miss Minkwltz’s brother came\nhome from the University of Lelpsie,\nat which he was studying, according\nto I,ouls Vlereck In Success magazine,\nand told the company a German stu\ndents’ joke. Everybody knows how\njeep these are. This Joke must have\nbeen particularly good, for every ono\nlaughed, most of all Teddy. Franlein\n: Mlnkwltz was greatly surprised at\n! this and asked him how he could un\nderstand it at all. Thereupon Teddy\n| proceeded to repeat the whole story to\nher in English In a way which prove 1\nbeyond doubt that he saw the point.\n| “lie seemed to pick up things—one\ndidn’t know how,” she said.\nAt that time Frau ltat had in her\n■service a good old servant girl named\ni Emily, who had an admirer by the\nname of Charles, a fact which had\nescaped the Mlnkwltz family’s atten\ntion altogether, although the girl had\n1 stayed with them for some years.\nTheodore had been in the house out\na few days when one morning he cre\nated a sensation by saying: “Emllte,\nleh bln Karl: ieh Hebe du!" (“Emily,\nI am Karl; I love thee! )\nHe was passionately fond «f books\nIon natural science, especially of\nBrehm\'s “Thlerleben,” which he stud\nied eagerly. One day he got it Into\nhis head that he must have a rat, a\nI mole or a hamster. When he asked\n\' Miss Mlnkwitz where he could get one\nshe told him that she didn’t know.\nThe lad then began to Investigate for\nhimself and finally came back from\nthe city swinging in triumph, like a\ntrophy, a dead mole and a dead German j\nmarmot. He had discovered a man\nwho had white mice for sale and from\nhim he procured what he wanted. He\nnext went to work to strip the animals\nof their skins in the kitchen and pre\npared to boll them in one of Frau ]\nMinkwitz’s saucepans. But here the\ngood old Frau Hat Interfered. He\ntherefore went to the back yard built\nhimself a little oven from bricks,\nskinned the animals, and, after hav ng\nboiled them, prepared them\nputting together skillfully all the parts\n\' of the skeleton.\nlUeh Soil 1» ti.ma.mM.\nNew Englander (visiting In Kansas)\'\n\'—Why don’t you raise punklns out\nUeKa?nsan-We tried it, but the soil 1*\ntoo rich for ’em.

Un\nless the cut is painful, this dressing\nshould not be removed until the place\nis healed over.\nA General Antidote.—The following\nprescription Is recommended ns a gen\neral antidote for poisons.

Keep the Iron in a bottle and\nthe magnesia and charcoal in another.\nWhen used, add the contents of the\ntwo bottles to a pint of water, shake\nthoroughly and take from three to six\ntablespoonfuls.\nGargling.—It Is very necessary to\nteach children early how to gargle the\nthroat. It Is not a difficult thing to\nteach a child, if taught before the\nthroat becomes sore and the act be\ncomes a necessity. The teaching may\nbe made a pastime, and the knowledge\nso gained may save much trouble and\nsuffering, and perhaps life Itself.

It is true that Catarrh usually begins with •\ncold in the head, but when the poisons, which are thrown off through the\nsecretions, fin 1 their way into the blood, it becomes a constitutional trouble\nthat affects alUparts of the body. It has more annoying and disgusting symp\ntoms than any other disease. There is a sickening and offensive discharge\nfrom the nostrils, a constant buzzing noise in the ears, headaches and pains\nin the eyes are frequent, while filthy, tenacious matter drops back into the\nthroat requiring continual hawking and spitting, and in certain stages of the\ndisease the breath has an odor that is very offensive. Catarrh is worse i n\nWinter, because the cold weather closes the pores and glands,‘and the pois\nons and unhealthy vapors which should pass off that way are thrown back\non the tender linings and tissues, causing the inflammation which starts\nthe unhealthy secretions to be ab\nsorbed by the blood. When the blood\nbecomes diseased with this catarrhal\nmatter all kinds of complications may\nbe looked for. As the blood circu\nlates through the Ixxly the foul mat\nter finds its way into the stomach,\nruining the digestion and producing\nchronic Dyspepsia, or Catarrh of the\nstomach. It also affects the Kidneys,\nSeveral years ayo my blood was toad\nand I had in addition a dreadftil oaee of\nCatarrh.

You cannot get rid of Ca\ntarrh by treating it with sprays, washes, inhalations, etc., because they only\nreach the membranes and tissues, while the real cause of the trouble is in the\nblood. These relieve the annoying symptoms for a time, but the poison is\nall the while getting a stronger hold on the system and when they are left\noff will manifest itself \\n worse form than before. S. S. S. is the greatest of\nall blood purifiers, and when it has cleansed the blood, this pure, rich stream\ncirculates through the body, carrying healthful properties to the diseased\nparts. Then the inflamed membranes and tissues begin to heal, the dis\n— - — charges cease, the general condition of\nthe system is strengthened, every one\nof the annoying and disgusting symp\ntoms pass away, and the patient is left\nin perfect health. S. S. S. is the best\nremedy for Catarrh.
