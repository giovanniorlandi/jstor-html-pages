The latest census\nshows that the tribes are increasing\nin numbers all over the country\nGovernment experts and officials even\nmake the astounding statement that\nthere are more Indians now than\nwhen the country was first inhabited\nby white men. In early times the\nIndians lived almost entirely along\nthe sea coast and water courses, the\nvast interior being entirely unoccu\npied. Explorers nevet found the vil\nlages of the red men away from ocean,\nlake or river shore. Occupying only\na small part of the country when\nthe Pilgrim fathers landed, their num\nber was greatly exaggerated and over\nestimated. The Pilgrims were in\nneed of just such locations as the In\ndians coveted, hence their incessant\nwarfare.

I\nbelieve that an attendance of this\nmeeting will be of great assistance to\nthe teachers of the state in their fu\nture work.

While on their trip\neast they will inspect a number of\nsimilar buildings with modern equip\nment, which it is believed will give\nthe board a better idea of what is re\nquired, in order to spend the $60,000\nat the disposal of the board in a judi\ncious manner. They will probably\nleave for the east the first of next\nweek, going direct to Chicago, where\nthey will spend several days looking\nover the public buildings in that city.\nBABY SHOES\nIt dont make much dif\nference what color baby\nshoes are this spring, just\nso they are\nRED\n\'Better not have a Baby this year if\nyou can\'t buy him VffiD SHOES.\nRed Vica Leather, voith Inserted,\nFancy Colored Trimmings, Spring\nHeels, or Ivedge Heels.

Suspicion was first drawn\nto him by his attempting to pass a\n$20 Confederate bill in the restaurant\nof Lee Lac. The United States dis\ntrict attorney has been notified and\nYoung will be held until the case is\nthoroughly investigated.\nJohn Clark, who was arrssted\non the charge of vagrancy, yesterday\nwas given his choice, by Judge Mc\nArthur today, of leaving town or a\nfine of $30 or 10 days in jail. He pre\nferred to leave town and stood not\non the order of going.\nA warrant was sworn out by H. O.\nCarpenter, yesterday, charging Frei\nBundy with assault. Bundy was ar\nrested and tried before Justice McAr\nthur today. He was fined $5\nGANGS OF ITALIANS.\nTo Crowd Japanese Laborers From\nRailroad Work.\nThe report is current in Spokane\nthat in a few days large gangs of\nItalian laborers from the eastern and\nmiddle states will begin to arrive\nthere and other northwestern railway\ncenters, and that a short time later\nmany Japanese railway hands will be\nhunting work. It is claimed that the\nNorthern Pacific and Great Northern,\nacting jointly in the matter of secur\ning labor for construction work on the\nwestern divisions of tneir respective\nlines, principally in Washington, have\nsent an order to labor agencies in\nChicago, St. Louis and other points\nin the central states for 2,000 Italians.\nAt the request of the transconti\nnental roads the initial lines in the\nterritory where the men will be secur\ned have made a half rate for the busi\nness, and an agent has been appointed\nto see that it is equally divided among\nall roads entitled to have a part.\nThis is the largest order for rail\nroad labor that has ever been placed\nin the west at one time and has two\nmeanings. In the first place it means\nthat both roads this year will do a\nlarge amount of construction work\nin this state and adjacent districts,\nspending an enormous amount of\nmoney in wages. In the second place\nit marks the end of the Japanese and\nChinese as railroad laborers on the\ntwo northern coast lines. Better wages\nwill be paid for the class of labor de\nmanded, and in this connection it is\nsaid work will progress more rapidly\nthan it has within that period.\nMONTH OF MUCH MONEY.\nThe amount of money disbursed by\nState Treasurer Barrett last month\nwas very large. The total disburse\nments amounted to $212,124.83. The\nlarge disbursements resulted from the\ninvestments by the state treasurer of\nschool income fund money in the sum\nof $108,292, in the Cascade county\ncounty bonds, also the payment of\n$34,861.72, interest and principal, for\nstate school of mines warrants. The\ndisbursements of the general fund\namounted to $61,138.43. The receipts\nfor the month were $82,180.43.\nThese figures are shown in the re\nport of State Treasurer Barret for the\nmonth of March, filed with the state\nauditor. The total sum in cash in\nthe different state funds amounts to\n$543,797.23 as compared with $673,\n741.63 at the first of the month. The\npermanent school fund contains $365/\n335.84, consisting of $193,564 bonds;\n$39,151.67 warrants and $132,620.17\ncash. The permanent university\nfund contains $32,422.62, consisting of\n$567.23 in warrants and $32,855.62 in\ncash. The state treasurer has been\nregistering general fund warrants\nsince March 19.\nJ.\nTELLS THE STORY\nOF* MONTANA\nSynopsis of the Labor Commissioners\nSeventh\'Annual Report.\nJ. A. Ferguson, commissioner of the\nstate bureau of agriculture, labor and\nindustry has received some advance\ncopies from the publisher, of the sev\nenth annual report, which was com\npiled by the retiring commissioner,\nJ. H. Calderhead.\nIt is by far the largest and most\ncomplete report ever issued from that\nbureau, containing 612 pages, and was\nprinted by the Independent publishing\ncompany, of Helena.\nAside from the general and special\narticles, and statistics, it is replete\nwith half-tone and chromotype en\ngravings. The purpose of the vol\nume is primarily to serve as an adver\ntising medium of the state and its\nvarious resources. In its introductory\nthe report says:\n"There is no state in the union,\nthere is no section in the world, that\noffers equal opportunity to capital or\nlabor, or to the agriculturist, horticul\nturist or stock raiser that Montana\ndoes, and while there is money seek\ning certain industrial investment,\nwhile there are those seeking oppor\ntunity for work, those looking for\nfarm homes, it is incumbent upon\nthe state so liberally endowed with\nthe gifts of a lavish nature, to inform\nthem. Montana has made wonderful\nstrides in development since it began\nits advancement, but as yet the state\nhas an abundance of almost every\nnatural resource to offer for the tak\ning, the only exaction being made that\nin possessing the advantages that na\nture has given, their development into\nremunerative industries follow."\nThe book is prepared with an es\npecial view of interesting strangers,\nsome of whom still look upon this\nstate as being the home of the buffalo\nand savage. That which will most\ninterest a stranger is the general\nknowledge of the state and this is giv\nen in the first and leading articles of\nthe volume, entitled "Montana." Fol\nlowing it, to make the reader more fa\nmiliar with the state as a mineral\nproducer, there is an article on the\nmines and mining industry of the state\nshowing the production to have been\nover $70,000,000 last year, and over\n$475,000,000 in Butte alone during the\nlast eighteen years.\nThe several counties are given at\ntention, and in the reading of these\nthe inquirer will get a good idea of\nthe particular resources of the differ\nent portions of the state and o ftho\ndevelopment that has been accom\nplished. Following these is an arti\ncle on irrigation and another on na\ntional irrigation, the latter given with\na view to bringing the arid regions\nof the state to the notice of the peo\nple of tne east, to the end that they\nmay see the vast possibilities of the\nwest to provide homes for the people\nof the overcrowded eastern cities.\nThe raising of cattle and sheep and\nthe growing of wool, two of the most\nimportant industries of the state\nMontana being the largest wool pro\nducer among the sheep growing states\nof the union—are considered at length.\nThe report contains a comprehen\nsive line of local statistics, among\nwhich is the complete official vote of\nevery precinct on the national, stat\nand county tickets, for 1900, and a list\nof the federal, state and county offi\ncials in each county of the state, with\ntheir politics and postofflee address\nThe celebrated Traphagen "pur\nfood" bill is given together with the\ncomplete tables of the anal /si i of dif\nferent articles of food made by Prof.\nTraphagen and his assistants. A very\ninteresting feature of the report is\nthe numerous illustrations which show\nperhaps bettor than anything else the\ndevelopment of the state.\nCommissioner Ferguson stated that\nthe report would be ready for distribu\ntion soon. He will have 2,500 copies\nfor the usual distribution throughout\nthe state and to the different public\nlibraries and the recent legislature\nmade appropriation for the printing\nand distribution of 50,000 copies\nthrough various portions of the east.\nA large number of these will go to the\nPan-American exposition at Buffalo,\nthis summer, some more to the indus\ntrial exposition at Charleston, S. C,\nlate next fall, and still another por\ntion of the edition will be reserved\nfor distribution at the St. Louis expo\nsition in 1903.\nof\nPOISONOUS RANGE PLANTS.\nReliable Antidotes for Poisoned Ani\nmals in the Northwest.\nThe report soon to be issued by the\ndepartment of agriculture upon the\nsubject of poisonous plants in the\nnorthwestern states promises to be of\ngreat value to cattle raisers and sheep\nbreeders In that section.\nThe stockmen have no general, sim\nple and reliable rule for selecting an\ntidotes or for the application of remed\nial measures. This deficiency may\nbe supplied to a large extent by adopt\ning the regular use of permaganate ot\npotash solution which is a very ef\nfective antidote in some cases of pois\noning by plants and chemical com\npounds of plants.\nEqual weights of permaganate of\npotash and sulphate of aluminum is\nprescribed as a remedy for plant pois\noning. It is important that all of the\nmixture should be in solution, as the\nsolid particles may kill the animal.\nThe most important poisonous spe\ncies of plants are death camas also\nknown as poison camas, lobelia, squir\nrel food,wild onion, poison sego,poison\nespecially dangerous during the wet\nsmooth, simple stemmed perennial,\nwith a coated, onionlike bulb, narrow,\nlinear leaves and a short terminal\ncluster of yellowish green flowers.\nIt grows everywhere in Montana in\nmoderately moist places on open\nranges, and is found in South Dakota,\nNebraska. Utah and California. Other\ndangerous plants are larkspur, lupines,\nthe water hemlock, the white loco, er\ngot, cow cockle and showy milk weed.\nThe majority of the plants that are\nplants are poisonous during certain\nmonths of May and June are so far ad\nvanced by the time the sheep are tak\nen to the mountain ranges that they\nare not eaten. The smaller species\nof larkspur and death camas are jo\ndry and shriveled by the middle of\nJuly viiat they are unpalatable to aiy\nanimal.\nThe water hemlock does not grow\nso abundantly in the mountains as\nalong the small streams and irrigating\nditches of the plains and becomes so\nlarge and coarse by the time men\ntioned that it is scarcely ever eaten\nby the sheep.\nThe tall larkspur, so far as the ex\nperts from the agricultural department\nobserved, does not grow on the plains\nin any part of Montana, and is too\ncoarse to be eaten by sheep during\nthe season from July to October.\nThe sheep owners have found by ex\nperience that these mountain ranges,\nwhich are so dangerous for sheep dur\ning the early summer, are quite safe\nfrom July to September, inclusive. The\nsafety of the mountain ranges, how\never, is somewhat affected by the\npresence of species of lupines. These\nplants ar poisonous during certain\nstages and especially when containing\nripe seeds.\nSheep seldom eat lupine on the\nrange during midsummer. If, however,\nthey eat it when the seeds are ripe,\nit invariably causes disaster. After\nthe early fall frost the pods rapidly\nopen the seeds fall upon the\nground. After this period the\nplants may be eaten with impunity\nby sheep or other animals.\nWhere salt is wanting stock more\neadily eat noxious plants than when\nthey are receiving it in regularly\nsuitable quantities.\n>\n>\nb\n[\nI»\nb\n,\np\nfor\nWatch Merigold\'s window for shirts\nthis week.\nCOLUMBIA FALLS ITEMS.\nSpecial Correspondence of the Bee:\nDeputy Sheriff C.
