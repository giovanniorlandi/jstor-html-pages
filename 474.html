Peeler, industrial agent ,\nof the Katy, was the first speaker:\nat the afternoon session. His sub- \\\njed was "The Good Roads Special j\nTrain." Mr. Peeler declared that]\nbad roads ai»· a great drawback to ;\nι ht- establishment of factories In any j\ncommunity The Katy fully realizes\nthe miportanre of :he Rood roads ι\nmovement and is doing all that it j\ntan to ί neon rage tie people along!\nth·· line of improving the public i\nhighways of the country. As a re- j\nsuit of the great amount of adver\ntising being sent out by the Katy\nboaieseekeis are coming from north· j\nem s\'au·?· to th»· southwest, and the\nmajority of them are headed for\nTexas because i»n*> can secure lands\ncheaper here than elsewhere. Mr.\nPeeler said it was the desire of his\nroad to establish a more friendly re\nlation between the railroads of the\ncountry and the people. The rail\ntoads are dependent upon the fa m·\ners for their existent··, and the- «·■\n»\nt,;blishment of good public oad~\nwill be of untold bent-fit to the rail\n«a* line» of the country.\nν the conclusion of Mr. Peeler\'-.\n• · . · u\'ks the Trinity i\'ni*ei>; ν tl\\> e\nClub favored \'he audience with a\n.«on4 The club made a distin·\nhit vtHh the awUaBca and;\nthe stagers were ■ coat\npelted to respond to an en core\nMi Wellington Κ Loucha wa* so\nϊ ; · <1 a»«t wit!j the singit!\' thrtt\nhe offered a motion that the club\nbe *ender*d α rising vote of thank·\nfor the mo»< w iHwt utusi. ftimi- li\ned Th·· motion wa· adop\'ed with\na «noria of ippt*U«e.

Ooit, civil engineer and\nroad expert of New York City, left\nthe party two or thr*» days ago and\nfailed to reach here in time to give\nhis chalk talk on "Streets, Roads\nand Drainage." in his place Prof.\nBaldwin delivered a very interesting\nlecture on "The Country Boy." Mr.\nBaldwin explained thai with good\n[country roads the boys would quit\nleaving the farm to go to the city.\nWith good public roads there would\nbe colleges, high schools and grad\ned schools in the country where the\n(Children could be educated without\nhaving to be sent away from home.\n\' Hon. T. P. Rixey, organizer of the\nNational Good Roads Association,\ndelivered an address on the subject\nof "Legislation." He made a strong\nappeal for the» enactment of a uni\nform road law in the state, and the\ncreation of the office of state high\nway commissioner. He said that\nresolutions did not build roads, but\nthat it took action. He wanted to\nsee the time come when the children\nof the country would have the same\neducational advantages as children\nof the city, and rhis could be accom\nplished with i;ood roads.\n______\nCounty Associai ion Formed.\nAt the conclusion of Mr. Rixey\'s\naddress the committee on Derma\nnent organization reported.

Loucks, organiz\ner for the National Good Roads As\nsociation, delivered a highly enter\ntaining and instructive address on\n"The Moral Effect of Good· Roads\niand Good Streets."\nMr. Scott of New York City was\nI then introduced to the audience. He\njsaid good roads were needed in this\ncountry today more than anywhere\nelse. There was no reason why pres\nent conditions should continue in\nEllis county. With the wealth of\nthe county there ought to be good\nroads from one end to the other.\nThe county Is now spending anntialh\nmore than the interest would amount\nto on $500,000 worth of bonds, and\nlittle is being accomplished.\nThe stereopticon lecture by Col.\nMoore was very instructive. The\nviews showed the work of road con\nstruction in the countries of Europe,\nmany of them being revelations In\nthe art of road building to the ma\nJority of the audience.
