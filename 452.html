All applications\nof employees for such deferred clas\nsification must be approved by divi\nsion heads and finally passed on by\nHoward Coonley, vice president.\nA general order, issued Wednesday\nnight, calling on employees to report\ntheir status, says:\n"The United States shipping board\nEmergency Fleet corporation will not\naid any drafted man to secure at his\nown instance \'emergency fleet listing\'\ndeferred classification in the draft,\nor any delay of Induction into the mili\ntary service.\n"When the United States shipping\nboard Emergency Fleet corporation\nseeks \'emergency fleet listing* defer\nred classification in draft, or delay in\ninduction into military service for\ndrafted men, it is to be clearly under\nstood that such request will be con\nfined to casés where the qualifications\nof and services which are being ren\ndered by the drafted men are, from\nthe national viewpoint, more essen\ntial for ship production than for mili\ntary service."\nReports of employees as to their\nstatus under the selective service act\nare to be sent to Vice President Coon\nley at Philadelphia before August 10.\nThe reports will be referred to division\nand section chiefs, who will be re\nquired to submit a brief to Mr. Coon\nley, giving reasons why the men are\nmore necessary for ship construction\nthan for military service.\nIn commenting on the order, Mr.\nCoonley made the following statement:\n"The officers of the United States\nshipping board Emergency Fleet cor\nporation feel that they should ask for\nexemption for those individuals only\nwho have special experience and abil\nity which makes them essential to the\nsuccessful carrying out of the ship\nbuilding program. In such cases the\nofficials took the position that it is\nthe duty of the individual to subordin\nate a natural desire for active service\nat the front to greater service which\nhe can render in the ship building pro.\ngram.

Only\nthose who have taken the full train\ning course are eligible for service with\nour forces overseas These nurses are\nbeing drawn largely from our hospi\ntals at home. Their places must be\nfilled by student nurses enrolled for\nthe full training course of from two to\nthree years. Every young woman who\nenrolls in the United States student\nreserve is releasing a nurse for ser\nvice at the front and swelling the\nhome army which we must rely on to\nact as our second line of hospital de\nfense. Upon the health of the Ameri\npeople will depend the spirit of\ncan\ntheir fighting forces.\nThe call is for women between the\nages of nineteen and thirty-five,\ninformation and application blanks\nmay be had from Miss Nettie Rice at\nthe county offices, chairman of Wo\nmen\'s Council of National Defense.\nFull\n!\ni\nKoldpack Fruit Jar Holders\nMAKE COLD PACK CANNING SAFE AND EASY—LESSEN DANGER\nOF SCALDS AND BROKEN JARS\nu\n!\ni\nj\n10 Cents Each\nRUBBERS FOR MASON JARS. 3 DOZ.

The\ngeneral had visited a large number of\nour wounded at noon, passing from |\ncot to cot, inquiring:\n"Well, boys, what can I do for you?" |\n"This is the answer I got," he said\nWednesday telling of the visit:\n\'"General, can\'t you get us some\ngood old beefsteak smothered in on\nions? They want to keep feeding us\nsoup. And, general, a few smokes\nwouldn\'t go bad.\'\n"I knew just how they felt. They\'re\ngoing to get their beefsteak, onions\nand smokes. They can have anything\nthey want from me; I like that crowd."\nAmong several hundred wounded\nthe general heard only three com\nplaints about treatment. The dough\nboys are showing a wonderful spirit of\nsclf-sacrifice. For example, the doc- j\ntors passed along one spot where ;\nwounded lay stretched beneath trees\nThe doctors were picking out the\ncases to be sent to the rear.\n"Don\'t take me. doc; take Bill, there.\nI\'m not in bad shape.

You\'re dying, and\nknow it, and I\'ll knock what\'s left of )\nyour blooming head off if you say an- ;\nother word."\nAnother scene: It took place Wed\nnesday morning in a hospital farther\nin the rear, where a young Kentuck\nian lay mortally wounded. Unable to\nspeak, he beckoned to a nurse and\nmade signs indicating that he was,\nthirsty. She brought him a glass of j\nwater. He drank it eagerly, then mo\ntioned her to stoop near the side of\nhis cot.
