        <pre>['163 \nREPORTS \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nUkrainian folklore in Kazakhstan \n \nNatalie Kononenko \nModern Languages and Cultural Studies \nUniversity of Alberta \nEdmonton, AB, Canada \n \nPavlodar is on the other side of the earth – quite literally. There is a \n12 hour time difference between Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, where I \nlive and Pavlodar, Kazakhstan, where I spent a month of my summer. \nThus when it is 6AM in Edmonton, it is 6PM in Pavlodar. Getting to \nPavlodar takes a full day. I left on the evening of June 15 and, had I \nmade all my connections, I would have arrived on the morning of June \n17. Coming home, my travel time, with plane changes, was 23 hours and \n45 minutes.  \nSo why go to Pavlodar? Part of it is the adventure of it all. Why go \nto Penticton when you can go to Pavlodar? Anyone can go to Penticton; \nPavlodar is more of a challenge. But it is not just the risk-taking side of \nmy nature that took me to Pavlodar. There were many other reasons. The \npersonal ones revolve around a desire to see Central Asia, to compare the \nKazakh steppe to the Ukrainian one and to the Canadian prairies, to learn \nmore about the Turkic world.  \nLike many Ukrainians born outside of their home country, I had an \nimagined Ukraine, a constructed and romanticized picture of my \nhomeland that I had formed in my mind and that begged to be compared \nto the real thing. I have been able to satisfy my desire to see the real \nUkraine, having done extensive fieldwork there since a few years after \nUkrainian Independence and having travelled to many regions of the \ncountry. Unlike many Ukrainians, however, I also had an imagined \nCentral Asia. I am not sure how I acquired this image. Perhaps it was my \nwork on Ukrainian dumy, epics in which Turkic warriors come charging \nfrom the steppe. Perhaps it was the time that I spent in Turkey working \non my doctoral dissertation. Whatever the cause, I had acquired my \nimagined Central Asia – and I had never seen the real thing. Thus my \ncuriosity was great.  \nThere were also academic reasons for going to Pavlodar. Many of \nthe villages to the north and east of Pavlodar, villages with names like \nKhmelnitskoe, were settled by Ukrainians at about the same time that \nUkrainians came to Canada. Studying folklore in these villages would do \na great deal towards helping me understand Ukrainian folklore in \n', '164 \n \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nCanada. I had learned over my long academic career that comparative \nwork is enormously rewarding. If one can look at a phenomenon such as \nadaptation to a new setting from more than one perspective, then the \ninsights one gains are multiplied many-fold. So, when the opportunity to \ndo fieldwork in Kazakhstan presented itself, I accepted. I will not pretend \nthat I did not hesitate. I knew that the trip would be difficult and that the \ncircumstances under which I would work would be trying. Later when \nthings went wrong and a money transfer I sent was not accepted, when \nemail failed to function, when I was unable to reach any of my contacts \nby phone, my doubts about the wisdom of my decision to travel \nmounted. But I went nonetheless. \nThe catalyst for the trip was the Second All-Russia Folklore \nCongress in Moscow, held in February, 2010. A friend talked me into \ngoing – then cancelled her trip so that I ended up being the only person \nfrom North America at the meeting. But the adventures of that meeting \nare the topic of another story. Prior to that Congress I had felt that one of \nmy tasks as a scholar was to present the folklore of the Slavic world, \nspecifically Ukraine, in a manner that my Soviet Ukrainian colleagues \ncould not. Soviet ideology dictated a certain interpretation of folklore \nand allowed collection of only those genres that supported a Sovietapproved\nworld view. Thus genres that might be construed to extol \nUkrainian nationalism, such as historical poems or dumy, were taboo and \nI felt that it was my duty to write about these poems and other historical \ngenres and about the professional minstrels who performed them, which \nI did.  \nThe Second All-Russia Folklore Congress was not all-Russian by \nany means. In fact, there were many colleagues from Ukraine and other \nnation states that had once been part of the Soviet Union. The papers \nthese folklorists, and those from Russia itself, presented were very good. \nListening to them I got no sense that something was being left \nunexplored or that scholars were forcing an interpretation onto their data, \nas had happened during Soviet times. Their folklore work was of the \nhighest quality. At the same time it became painfully clear that similarly \ngood folklore work was not being done in Canada. People would ask me \nabout the study of Ukrainian and other Slavic traditions in Canada and I \nhad to admit that much of the collecting work here was done by students. \nThe sort of detailed and systematic research that was being done in the \npost-Soviet world was sadly lacking in Canada. It was this realization \nthat led me to commit myself to Ukrainian Canadian folklore research.  \n', '165 \nREPORTS \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nI started on Ukrainian Canadian fieldwork in the summer of that \nsame year. I headed out to the Peace country of northern Alberta with \ncolleagues from the history department who were documenting the \nsacred heritage of the Canadian prairies, photographing rural churches \nthat had fallen into disuse and might soon disappear. Working with this \ngroup I asked the historical questions that they wanted answered and, for \nthe folklore component, I asked about rituals. I asked about holidays \nsuch as Christmas and Easter. I gathered information about weddings and \nfunerals and baptisms. I also did some documentation of material culture, \nnamely embroideries and other textiles, and interviewed collectors of \nUkrainian folk art.  \nMy work in Ukrainian Canada was most enjoyable and rewarding, \nbut I knew it could be better still with a comparative dimension. Here too \nthe Second All-Russia Folklore Congress came into play for it was there \nthat I met Alevtina Tsvetkova, a folklorist from Pavlodar Toraigyrov \nState University. She invited me to join her on a fieldtrip to the \nUkrainian villages of Kazakhstan. For her, inviting me was an \nopportunity to learn about Western approaches. She perhaps also saw a \nchance to advance her own position at her university by bringing in a \nprominent scholar from Canada, something that few of her colleagues \ncould do. I know that she wanted to push for more attention to the study \nof Slavic folklore in a political atmosphere that promoted all things \nKazakh at the expense of other nationalities. Bringing in a foreign \nUkrainianist would do that and, indeed, my visit did draw attention and I \nwas interviewed on Kazakh television. For me going to Kazakhstan was \nthat chance to go to Central Asia. Academically, the Kazakhstan project \nwas to be similar to my work in Canada: it was to be the collection of \nritual information. The comparative part was to include both Canada and \nUkraine because my many trips to Ukraine had also produced extensive \ndocumentation of ritual. I must thank Tsvetkova for giving me my \nKazakh opportunity and I must also commend her for having the courage \nto invite a woman whom she had barely met to come and live with her \nfor a month. I am also deeply indebted to Mykhailo Paripsa, the head of \nthe Ukrainian organization in Kazakhstan for taking care of the practical \nand bureaucratic aspects of my visit and doing it well. It was he who \nissued my letter of invitation, a letter that easily got me a Kazakh visa. \nConsidering the problems I and others have had with visas to Russia, \nParipsa’s efficiency is much appreciated. It was Paripsa who contacted \nthe Ukrainian cultural organizations in the villages we visited, thus \n', '166 \n \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nlaying groundwork for the contacts with officials, the housing, and all the \nother practical arrangements that we enjoyed as we did our work.  \nI learned a great deal in Kazakhstan. I learned about ritual processes \nand adaptation to a new environment, the academic purpose of my trip. I \nalso learned about possible reactions to the post-Soviet world and \nvariation in the creation of new nation-states from old Soviet fabric. I \nlearned about ethnic tensions. I learned about the role that folklore plays \nin the lives of people no matter who or where they are. \nMy trip began with official duties. Bureaucracy and proper \nprocedure are very important in Kazakhstan, perhaps as much as they \nwere in the Soviet Union, and this was brought home to me time and \nagain. My flight into Kazakhstan was plagued with problems from \ndelayed take-offs to missed connections and lost luggage. When I finally \narrived in Pavlodar I was allowed to rest briefly and then sent to perform \nbureaucratic chores. I was told I had to register my residence, something \nthat had always been demanded when I travelled to the Soviet Union, but \nalso something I have not had to do in Ukraine since it became \nindependent. After standing in line for a long time to learn that \nCanadians no longer need a residency permit, my hostess and I went to \nPavlodar Toraigyrov State University where I had to pay my respects to a \nmyriad of officials. We went in reverse order, first the various lesser \nofficials and then the higher level dignitaries. After that I went to pay my \nfees, a process that was in itself a bureaucratic nightmare. I could not \nsimply sign an agreement saying that I would pay a certain price for my \ntransportation and lodging; before I left Canada I had to send a letter \nfrom my University, complete with an official signature and a stamp. \nSince stamps are not part of Canadian bureaucracy, as onerous as it may \nbe, finding something that would pass as a stamp proved to be a \nchallenge. Once stamped, this letter had to go to Kazakhstan in hard \ncopy; a fax would not do and, since registered mail is seldom sent \nbetween Edmonton and Pavlodar, this official letter (in three copies) took \nalmost a month to reach its destination, something that made both me \nand my hosts very nervous. But the letter did arrive shortly before I did \nand I paid the agreed-upon fees.  \nThe pressure to follow protocol did not end with my day of \nbureaucratic formalities at the university. In every village we visited I \nhad to check in with the local akim or government head, and I had to pay \nmy respects to every district akim as well. If the akim was not there on \nthe day of my arrival, I had to go back and pay my respects at a later \ndate, even if it interfered with my work, but not following proper \n', '167 \nREPORTS \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nprocedure was not an option. When my trip was over, I had to return to \nthe University for a round of formal farewells, something that I found \nquite burdensome since I was trying to pack and to make copies of all of \nmy data, but I did get a striking Kazakh robe as a gift at the end of all of \nthe formalities.   \nThe Soviet-like formalities were time-consuming, something that I \nwas painfully aware of since I had only one month to do my work. I also \ngot the uncomfortable feeling that I was constantly under surveillance, \nthat my every move was being watched. This too reminded me of Soviet \ntimes. But as unpleasant as the formalities may have been, they did have \ntheir benefits. Because the whole trip was quite formal and official, there \nwas always a place for us to stay. Sometimes there was transportation to \nthe next village. People were ready for us and Tsvetkova and I did not \nhave to spend several hours explaining what we were doing. Often local \nofficials had identified several people for us to interview. If I compare \nthis to my field experiences in Ukraine where everything was quite freewheeling\nand where my field partners and I would arrive in a village \nwith no prior notice, no contacts, and no certainty that we would find a \nplace to stay for the night, I can see that the formality of my Kazakhstan \narrangements did have its advantages. Even being constantly tracked and \nmonitored had its plus side. In Ukraine I had been taught not to let \npeople know that I was a foreigner. I was told not to register or check in \nwith village officials because that might make the people whom I wanted \nto interview nervous. The pressure to go unnoticed trained me well and I \ngot very good at blending in and virtually disappearing. This almost led \nto a real disappearance on one occasion when a couple of thugs in a \nparticularly poor village did discover that I was a foreigner and decided \nto kidnap me and hold me for ransom. I faced no such dangers in \nKazakhstan.  \nIn addition to the bureaucracy and the close monitoring of my \nactivities, there were many other things in Kazakhstan that reminded me \nof my times in the Soviet Union. One was the lack of consumer goods, \nespecially western ones. There are no McDonalds in Pavlodar, or even \nthe capital Astana. You cannot buy a Coke, though Ukrainian juices and \nhorilka (vodka) were available and the local beer was quite good. There \nare some imported goods, like clothing and appliances, but most are from \nneighboring China or the Middle East, with a few things from Europe \nand nothing from Canada or the United States. The official reason for \nlack of consumer goods is a policy of protectionism, keeping out foreign \nproducts that might compete with Kazakh-produced merchandize in \n', '168 \n \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \norder to give the Kazakh economy a chance to grow. There may also be \nsome attempt to keep the local population from knowing about life in the \nWest, much as there was in the Soviet Union. I cannot speak to this \nbecause this was not mentioned by anyone. I can say, however, that most \ntelevision shows featured local or Russian programs. Foreign films \ndubbed into the local languages, Kazakh or Russian, seemed more scarce \nthan dubbed foreign movies in Russia itself. \nWhile people in Kazakhstan got little chance to learn about life in \nthe West, they could potentially see economic prosperity rivaling that of \nany Western city right in their own capital. There is a stark contrast \nbetween the countryside and the opulence of Astana. Many villages lack \nroads and one simply drives across the steppe to get to where one is \ngoing. Electricity was available in all locations that I visited, but there \nwas no gas except that sold in canisters and there was no plumbing \nexcept in a few houses where the owners had installed water pumps. \nMeanwhile, Astana has gorgeous and literally shining buildings, coated \nwith colored glass to reflect the sun. There are stunning flower beds with \nflowers planted to look like Kazakh decorative motifs. There are \nrecreation and amusement areas with such frivolous attractions as an \nindoor wave pool and miniature replicas of world heritage monuments \nsuch as the Statue of Liberty. And there is an observation tower from \nwhich one can survey the whole glittering panorama. People did not \nseem to resent the Astana/village contrast. Rather, they seemed to take \npride in what had been accomplished in Astana, presumably hoping that \nimprovements would eventually come to villages as well..  \nMan-made factors are not the sole determinant of life in \nKazakhstan. Climate and topography are very important. The land is \nharsh. The area where I was is flat and gets little rain. Lakes or ponds are \nfew and many of the ones that do exist are salt lakes and not potable; \nlittle grows around them. In the summer the temperature can reach forty \ndegrees Celsius or about 100 degrees Fahrenheit; in the winter it can be \nminus forty a point where the two temperature systems converge. Winds \nblow with no impediments and are strong enough to virtually knock you \noff your feet. A particularly fierce storm is the winter buran, a white-out \nsnow storm characterized by horizontally blowing snow. Trees grow \nonly on river banks and in villages where they get some shelter from the \nwind. Attempts to plant rows of trees as windbreaks, something that was \ndone successfully in the Ukrainian steppe, has, on the Kazakh steppe, \nproduced rows of blackened tree stumps. It is difficult to convey the \noverwhelming feeling of isolation that one gets in the wide open spaces \n', '169 \nREPORTS \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nof Kazakhstan. The horizons are endless and the land featureless. But the \nstrongest impression was the feeling of falling off the edge of the world \nthat I got when I reached the end of a village. Inside a village one is \nsurrounded by houses and vegetation. There are streets and animals and \npeople. But when you come to the end of a street, as I did while walking \naround villages looking for the homes of people I had been told to \ninterview, you are confronted with nothingness. The village ends; the \nstreet ends – and there is steppe, just steppe, an endless expanse of \nbrownish, sunburnt grass stretching as far as the eye can see. There are \nno houses, no trees, no animals – nothing. Sometimes far, far in the \ndistance I could see a black mass – the village cattle herd. Sometimes, \ncloser by, there would be the lone silhouette of a horse on the horizon – a \nbeautiful picture, but one that emphasizes the isolation of the steppe. \nNeedless to say, this is not an easy place to grow anything. All \ngarden plants such as tomatoes are surrounded by little dams meant to \ntrap the precious few drops of water. The most successful farm products \nare wheat, cattle, and sheep. The latter are consumed primarily by \nKazakhs; the Slavs prefer beef to mutton or lamb. The diet consists of \nvarious dough products and meat, which may not sound bad until one has \neaten meat, often fatty meat, with various forms of boiled dough and \nvirtually no vegetables for a month. This is a very practical diet. The \nmanty and pilmeni, two forms of dumplings filled with chopped meat, \ncan be cooked for the midday meal and reheated for the evening meal \nand for breakfast. But it is a very monotonous diet and I had no idea how \ntasty something like corn or broccoli would seem until I had spent a \nmonth in Kazakhstan. There was also a lack of fruits. Villagers did have \nberries such as strawberries and raspberries in their gardens, but I seemed \nto be one of the few people interested in eating them raw. Most people \nsaw them as suitable for conversion into jam which would be eaten with \nthe enormous quantities of tea with milk or sour cream that everyone \ndrank.  \nKazakhstan is a very large country, the ninth largest in the world, \nbut it is sparsely populated. It has mineral resources and oil and gas, but \nit is just not that wealthy. Kazakhstan’s low population density and its \nflat landscape, probably along with its remoteness from Moscow and its \nnon-European indigenous population, prompted the Soviet government \nto select it as the site for its atomic bomb testing program. The area \naround Semipalatinsk, not that far from Pavlodar, was the location of \nsome 460 nuclear explosions between 1949 and 1989. Nuclear testing \nhas stopped but its legacy lingers. Kazakhstan is still an area where \n', '170 \n \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \npollution is tolerated. In Pavlodar itself there is an aluminum plant with \nthree enormous smoke stacks which constantly spew toxins over the city. \nConcerns about its health effects surface constantly and time and again \nthe choice between the population’s health and economic prosperity is \nresolved in favor of the latter. As I drove around Kazakhstan, I saw other \nfactories with smokestacks touching the clouds and adding a brown \nstreak to them. I could not help but notice the general ill health of the \npopulation, the high blood pressure, the aches and pains, the mobility \nproblems. Was this caused by pollution? It is almost impossible to tell \nwithout a systematic study. What I saw could also be the result of lack of \nhealth care: medical services, especially in villages, are difficult to \nobtain.  \nWhat was striking was that people had an almost macho approach to \nthe situation. Pollution was one of the many adversities that the \nharshness of life in Kazakhstan presented and they took a certain pride in \nfacing adversity. The climate was a challenge and pollution was another \naspect of the environment that needed to be dealt with and overcome. \nThe attitude toward pollution was analogous to the attitude toward the \neconomy. There was optimism that, now that Kazakhstan was \nindependent, the problems would be solved.  \n \nUkrainian Villages \n \nThe specific villages that I went to are called Ukrainian villages. \nThey were founded by Ukrainians more than one hundred years ago as a \nresult of the Stolypin Reforms. Petr Stolypin, Russia’s Agricultural \nMinister and later Prime Minister, opened up lands such as those located \naround Pavlodar and encouraged the settlement of peasants by granting \nprivate ownership of land. This measure, he hoped, would make \ncapitalists out of farmers and lead them to support tsarist rule. It was the \nStolypin Reforms that first brought peasants from Ukraine to \nKazakhstan. The stories I heard about the early settlers were tales of \ncourage. I heard about groups of men coming to an essentially barren \nland and building sod houses, literally carving up the steppe to make \ndwellings, then bringing their families to join them. The names of the \nfounders were known in most villages and current residents took pride in \nbeing descended from them. There were also interesting legends about \nStolypin himself. A number of people claimed that he had actually \nvisited their villages once they were officially founded, usually around \n1908/1909, and that he had approved of what he saw. Krasilovka a \n', '171 \nREPORTS \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nvillage whose name derives from krasa, a word that means beauty, \nboasted that the name of the village was bestowed by Stolypin himself.  \nLater migrations of Ukrainians came in the 1930s in response to the \nHolodomor. Kazakhstan itself experienced a famine at that time, but land \nwas more plentiful and requisitioning efforts not as severe. Russians also \ncame to Kazakhstan, though there does not seem to be a specific period \nof Russian immigration. A big influx of population came during the \nSecond World War. As Kazakhstan was used for dangerous nuclear tests, \nso it was also used for people who were deemed dangerous by the Soviet \nregime, namely ethnic Germans, specifically those that had been living \nalong the Volga. Ukrainian villages were among the recipients of exiled \nGermans. The last big influx of new settlers came with the Virgin Lands \nprogram in the late 1950s and early 60s. In response to Khrushchev’s \nplan to turn the Kazakh steppe into a major grain-producing area, people \ncame from Ukraine, Russia, and elsewhere in the Soviet Union.  \nThe first assumption that I encounter from people in the Diaspora \nwho hear about my trip is that the Ukrainians in Kazakhstan were \nvictims, exiled there by Soviet authorities. Ukrainians, especially people \nwho had converted to Protestant religions associated with Germany, were \nindeed exiled to Kazakhstan during Soviet times, but they went to areas \nother than Pavlodar. The people in the villages around Pavlodar were not \nexiles and not victims; they were anything but that. They saw themselves \nas brave pioneers, conquerors of a wild frontier. They were people who \ntook charge of their lives. One woman I interviewed in Shcherbakty had \nbeen the head of a Ukrainian workers brigade sent to build the grain \nelevator. She met her future husband and stayed and she was proud of \nher life and her contribution to the village. The downside to the frontier \nmentality of the local population is the willingness to tolerate pollution. \nOtherwise their positive outlook is most heartening. \nThe villages have experienced new challenges in recent times. \nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed, many ethnic Germans left for \nGermany. Right now large portions of some villages are deserted with \ncollapsed houses or completely empty lots because of German \noutmigration. Farms, grain elevators, and factories sit idle. As I worked \nin the various villages to the east and north of Pavlodar, there would be \nstark contrasts from village to village. The Soviet Union had produced a \nrelatively efficient system of working the land. Family plots were small \nand the villagers worked in large collectives, seeding huge tracks of land \nwith wheat, barley, buckwheat and even corn. Collectives owned literally \nthousands of heads of cattle. Land was privatized when Kazakhstan \n', '172 \n \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nbecame an independent nation. If people took their individual allotments, \nand especially if there was a loss of population due to the departure of \nGermans, then the villages struggled. If, however, the collective stayed \ntogether, then the villages prospered. This was the case in Orlovka where \nthe village head under the Soviet system, a descendant of the original \nturn-of-the-century Ukrainian settlers named Poliakov, kept the village \ntogether as a corporation in which each resident held a share. In Orlovka \nthe streets are clean and in good repair. The fields are green and not \nfallow. The village owns 8000 head of cattle, some beef and some dairy, \nand has worked out an interesting system of letting the herd stay in the \nsteppe and trucking the milkmaids and milking equipment out to the \ncows. Needless to say, no one has left a place like Orlovka and there are \nno empty houses. In villages that did not follow Orlovka’s example, \nsome people have done relatively well. There has been a shift from \nkeeping large animals such as cows to raising small ones such as fowl. \nStill, there are people who keep literally hundreds of geese and chickens \nwhich they sell for meat. These farmers also have at least a few head of \ncattle and sell sour cream and butter, the dairy products that keep well. \nMost villagers, however, have not prospered under privatization unless at \nleast one member has a job outside the family farm such as in the village \nadministration or the village school.    \nI learned a great deal in Kazakhstan and not just about keeping \nchickens and separating milk and making little dams to concentrate water \non tomato plant roots. I learned about folklore and culture and, \ncomparing what I saw to what I had seen in Canada and Ukraine, I was \nable to gain the insights into cultural adaptation that I had sought. I think \nthat one of the most important things that I learned is that each \ngeographical region develops its own culture and folklore. The culture \nand lore cannot be fully explained by the region in which a particular \ngroup finds itself though the nature of the region is important and that is \nwhy I have given the description above. But climate, geography and \ncontact cultures cannot fully explain what is going on and neither is there \na uniform process that occurs whenever a culture moves outside its \nhome. Rather, culture seems to be an entity which takes on a life of its \nown and develops much like a living organism. \nThe Ukrainians in Kazakhstan have developed a unique culture. \nThis culture varies from village to village, but there is enough \nconsistency to make it clear that there is a north Kazakhstan Ukrainian \nculture. The people speak a language that they call khokhlaitsky, a term \nderived from Khokhol, the Russian slang word for “Ukrainian.” This is a \n', '173 \nREPORTS \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nmixture of Ukrainian and Russian, but it is not the surzhyk \nUkrainian/Russian mix found in Ukraine itself. Rituals like weddings \nalso have a mix of Ukrainian and Russian elements, but, like the \nlanguage, the mix is different from what I have seen elsewhere. The \nconsistency of the mix from village to village made it clear that this was \na regional tradition, with variants, of course, but still enough common \nfeatures to make it identifiable as a local type.   \nAs in Canada, practical considerations play an important role in \nshaping local ritual. In Canada where one rural priest serves ten to fifteen \nchurches, the Christmas Eve service can be on Christmas Eve, or on \nChristmas Day, or several days before or after Christmas, depending on \nwhen the priest can visit a particular parish. Khram, or Praznik, the \nspecial celebration which takes place on the day of the saint after whom \na church is named, is often moved to the summer if the particular saint’s \nday falls in winter when country roads make traveling difficult. Provody, \nthe remembrance day for ancestors that should take place a week after \nEaster, can take place then or well into the summer, many weeks after \nEaster and sometimes as late as after Pentecost. This tends to be the day \nwhen people who have moved away from a village return to visit family \ngravesites and reconnect with their place of origin. Because this is such a \nbig event, it is often combined with Khram or Praznik and baptisms and \nweddings are often scheduled for the same day. About the only things \nwhich cannot be scheduled to coincide with Provody are funerals. The \ndominance of practical considerations is understandable in Canada where \nthere is an absence of magical world view and rituals are more a matter \nof social convention than an attempt to influence the future.  \nIn Kazakhstan a magical world view persists and may be even \nstronger than in Ukraine, perhaps because of the harsh living conditions. \nBut rituals are governed by practical considerations nonetheless. While \nMalanka, the New Years Eve celebration has flourished in urban Canada, \nperhaps because it offers one more party to add to the holiday season, in \nKazakhstan the big social event is Maslenitsa, the Shrove celebration \nbefore Great Lent. The choice of Maslenitsa is not motivated by the \nimportance of Lent to the local population. In fact, Lent is largely \nignored, probably because there are no legumes or other vegetables to \nsubstitute for the meat and milk protein that constitutes such an \nimportant part of the Kazakhstan diet. Rather, Maslenitsa has come to \nthe fore and become an event celebrated, not just in the home, but in the \nvillage center, with officials, school children, in fact most of the village \nin attendance, because it comes close to coinciding with Navriz, the \n', '174 \n \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nholiday of the New Year celebrated by the Kazakh population. With the \nemphasis on Kazakh culture that has come with independence and the \nnew, Kazakh-led regime, celebrating a Ukrainian holiday that can be \ncombined with one that is part of the dominant culture is a good way to \npromote one’s own.  \nKazakhstan does not have the practice of assigning one priest to \nserve a circuit of churches and, as a result, many villages have no church \nand no clergy person. The practical solution to this situation is for \nvillagers to perform various rites themselves, including important \nreligious ones such as baptism. Weddings can be performed with no \nclergy present. They are then officially registered to meet bureaucratic \ndemands. Registration can occur before the wedding, as in Ukraine, or it \ncan occur after the wedding, sometimes long after the wedding. It does \nnot seem to matter as long as the ritual itself, the folk aspect of the \nwedding, is performed. Perhaps the most striking practical performance \nof a ritual act comes at Iordan, or Kreshchenie, usually called Epiphany \nin the West. Water is blessed in church on this day and people take it \nhome to use for illness. They use it to bless the house and the cattle and \nkeep it for any situation where a little divine help is necessary. With no \nvillage church, there is no place to get water blessed on Epiphany. The \nsolution to this problem is very simple. People go out to the well on the \neve of Epiphany and draw water which they sincerely believe has \nmagical properties. Any number of people, both villagers and urban \ndwellers, swore that the water was special and had magical and healing \npowers. As evidence they pointed out that Epiphany water, unlike regular \nwater, would not spoil: there was never any trace of sediment or algae. \nSome people said that simply drawing water on the eve of January 19 \nwas not enough and that special actions needed to be taken. These \nincluded drawing water at a certain time, usually midnight, though 4AM \nand 6AM were also mentioned. Some people said that the water needed \nto be left outside for several hours so that the light of the moon and the \nstars could shine on it and confer the power of the heavens. A very few \nsaid that water either needed to be drawn at the time that a church service \nwould normally take place or that it needed to be set out at that time. The \nbelief in the magical properties of Epiphany water was remarkably widespread.\nI found it among religious people and those who were not \nreligious but had the magical world view we often associate with the \nfolk, especially those living in villages. I also found it in the city. A very \nsophisticated and educated city dweller and an avowed atheist also swore \nby the power of Epiphany water and gave me a number of other \n', '175 \nREPORTS \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \ninstances where he had observed the intervention of the supernatural into \nhis life. We cannot make neat categories and state that a magical world \nview is characteristic of uneducated country folk only. \nA similar combination of the practical and the magical can be found \nin the area of folk medicine. Folk medicine includes, in addition to holy \nwater, various herbs and tinctures made from them. Physical \nmanipulation, bone-setting included, falls in this category. There is also \nwide-spread use of charms and magic actions such as rinsing the face of \na colicky baby with dirty dishwater and wiping it with the inside of one’s \napron or skirt. Some of these charms or actions need to be performed by \na specialist, but many do not. In fact, in the absence of specialists, people \nwrite down charms and instructions for performing actions and say the \ncharms and perform the magical actions themselves. Cures are used to \nrelieve human suffering and are also widely applied to farm animals, \nespecially cattle, which is quite understandable considering the \nimportance of cattle to the local economy. In Kazakhstan, people were \nnot reluctant to talk about resorting to various magical practices; they \nshowed me their books of charms and let me photograph them. To them, \nthis was just something that was done and not really anything special. \nThis is quite different from the situation that I found in Ukraine where \nmagic practices, charms and magical actions among them, abounded, but \nwere hidden from view. People were reluctant to admit to knowledge of \nmagic in Ukraine, but not in Kazakhstan. This is possibly the result of \nmore extensive persecution of behavior that would be deemed \nsuperstitious and thus un-Soviet in Ukraine, a country closer to the \nSoviet heartland than the remote areas around Pavlodar. The contrast \nbetween Ukraine and Kazakhstan is also quite curious and needs further \ninvestigation since people in Kazakhstan attributed the source of their \nmagical knowledge to Ukraine and, indeed, the notebooks that they \nshowed me with charms and instructions for performing magical curative \nacts were written in Ukrainian, not khokhliatsky.   \nPeople took magic seriously in Kazakhstan and they fully believed \nin the efficacy of ritual acts. At the same time they viewed rituals as fun \noccasions, a chance to have a good time.  \nThe ritual elements that are most consistent between Ukraine, \nCanada, and Kazakhstan are not the solemn ones, the ones that seal the \nbond of matrimony, for example. Instead what people remember and \nwhat persists from country to country are carnivalesque elements such as \ncross-dressing at weddings. In all three places the solemn part of the \nwedding is followed by a mock wedding with a humorous mock bride \n', '176 \n \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nand groom. Who gets dressed up as the fake and funny couple varies, but \nsome sort of costuming, complete with feasting, often on stolen food, is a \nregular feature. People felt that weddings were important and solemn \noccasions, but they did not feel that they had to be solemn throughout the \nritual process. Lack of consistency did not bother anyone and even some \ndestructive behavior, such as stealing chickens and scratching up the \nwalls of the groom’s house, was tolerated. Comic and destructive \nelements are found not only in weddings but also in calendar rituals such \nas Christmas and Maslenitsa/Shrove. People even talked about the \nnecessity of joking at funerals to entertain the deceased and stated that \nthis was especially important while washing the body. A serious \napproach to ritual does not preclude levity.   \nThroughout my professional career I have sought to understand why \nfolklore persists. Travelling through a number of villages fairly quickly \nas I did on this trip it became obvious that folklore is necessary for wellbeing.\nPerhaps the benefits of folklore stood out with special clarity \nagainst the harsh natural and political environment of Kazakhstan, but \nthey were impossible to ignore. Those villages in which people actively \nengage in various forms of folklore turned out to be much more cheerful \nand friendly. In some villages no one does embroidery and the only \nembroidered objects were heirlooms made by mothers or grandmothers. \nWhen I asked about embroidery, people said that it was a thing of the \npast and that the old items, many of which were indeed treasured, did not \nreally fit in the home any more. As a result, they gave them to local \nmuseums. In Rozhdestvenka, inspired by an elderly and locally born \nresident named Klavdia Tereshyna and a woman who had moved to the \nvillage from Ukraine named Evheniia Bikotserkivets, everyone \nembroiders. They do some embroidery of the traditional type on ritual \ntowels called rushnyky and they do rushnyk designs on pillow cushions \nand runners. They also do a very modern adaptation of needlework, \nnamely embroidered pictures. Many pictures show scenes reflecting life \nin Ukraine, or Ukrainian life as the artists image it to be, but most \npictures have modern and area-specific motifs such as local flowers and \neven a mosque. The women in Rozhdestvenka are also remarkably \ncheerful. Their village is not super-prosperous like Orlovka and neither is \nit run-down like Krasilovka. But the women are noticeably happier than \nwomen who do not engage in crafts. I should note that, in northern \nAlberta, women with a similar disposition are also embroiderers or \nweavers or people who enjoy another craft such as crochet and the \nembroiderers also make pictures, often featuring Canadian scenes.  \n', '177 \nREPORTS \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nEmbroidery is only one of the folklore forms that leads to spiritual \nand physical well-being. In several villages there are groups that get \ntogether to sing. Some of these groups are formally organized by a local \nofficial such as the Dom Kul’tury (House of Culture) worker. The formal \ngroups get together to sing for personal enjoyment. They also perform at \nvarious holidays and other community events where they not only sing, \nbut showcase crafts and foods, and engage in competitions akin to bakeoffs.\nSome groups get together informally. In Khmelnitskoe, a group of \nwidows gathers to sing and chat. We joined them for a birthday \ncelebration that featured food, drink, and plenty of singing. Both formal \nand informal groups tend to be multi-ethnic. In the case of services \nprovided by a village official, multi-culturalism is a government \nmandate. But informal groups are also inclusive. The one in \nKhmelnitskoe is predominantly Ukrainian, but also has two Russian \nmembers and a Kazakh. The songs they sing are also predominantly \nUkrainian, though all members know and perform Russian and Kazakh \nsongs as well. Maintaining ethnic purity, so frequently a concern in \nUkrainian Diaspora groups both in Canada and the United States is just \nnot a concern here. In fact, it was not a concern in rural Alberta and \npeople made or sang what appealed to them, regardless of its ethnic \norigin. Ethnic purity, like maintaining solemnity during rituals or \ndifferentiating the magical from the scientific is not important. \nThat being said, Ukrainian culture did dominate in many ways. \nAlevtina Tsvetkova, an ethnic Russian herself, said that it was because \nUkrainians prize their culture more than other ethnic groups. Other \nreasons might be that Ukrainians outnumber other nationalities in the \nvillages that I visited or that they, as village founders, have established \ntheir culture more firmly. In any case, there are more Ukrainian clubs in \nvarious villages, more singing groups that dress in Ukrainian costume (or \nwhat they think is Ukrainian costume) when they perform. Perhaps the \nmost striking attestation of this fact were old photographs of weddings. \nIn my effort to get a sense of the history of ritual practice, I asked not \nonly about contemporary rituals, but about rituals as they were celebrated \nin the past. I also asked to see old photographs and rephotographed \nwhenever I could. In Kovalevka we were interviewing an elderly \nUkrainian woman whose daughter had married one of the local Germans \nand moved to Germany when the Soviet Union collapsed. The younger \ncouple had come back from Germany to visit. I asked about weddings \nand the man who now lived in Germany, spoke German, and had the \nvery German name of Jacob Blok, showed the wedding photographs of \n', '178 \n \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nhis older sisters. They were wearing white dresses, but on their heads \nwere very Ukrainian-looking wreaths, complete with ribbons. The \nweddings had taken place in Kovalevka and the family, while \nmaintaining their German identity, saw no problem with adopting \nUkrainian wedding wreaths.   \nThere are ethnic tensions in Kazakhstan. While this country was \nunder Soviet domination, everyone resented the Russians because it was \nthey who got the best jobs, the best schooling, the nicest living quarters. \nNow that Kazakhstan is independent and ruled by an ethnic Kazakh, \nalbeit one who was Communist Party head prior to independence, \neveryone who is not a Kazakh resents the Kazakhs. Virtually every \nvillage akim that I met and all district akims were Kazakhs. The police \nofficers were Kazakhs. The officials at the border when I flew in were all \nKazakhs. But resentment against any nationality exists in the abstract \nonly. Just as Kazakhs helped Ukrainians when they first came to settle in \nthis land, so now individual Kazakhs and Ukrainians and Russians and \nGermans are on the best of terms. In Uspenka a Ukrainian family whom I \ninterviewed had Kazakh neighbors and the little Kazakh child living next \ndoor not only regularly played at the home of the Ukrainian couple, but \ncalled them baba and dido, the Ukrainian words for grandma and \ngrandpa. I stayed with Kazakh families as well as with Ukrainian ones. \nThere are legends about the past which blame the Kazakhs for plugging \nup springs with felt and thus depriving the area of water. But the legends \nvoice precisely the general and abstract hostility that people feel. \nConcrete individuals are honored and cherished, regardless of \nnationality.  \nAnd this report would not be complete without the mention of at \nleast a few of the many moving individual stories that I heard. I talked to \na couple both of whom had tragically lost their spouses and descended \ninto depression, but then found each other and recovery and happiness. I \ntalked to several couples who had been together all their long lives and \nshared their enthusiasm for Ukrainian song and other folk arts. There was \na man who had become an alcoholic and whose wife and children left \nhim. He had recovered with the help of his mother and music and now \nkept his mother’s house, which was immaculate and played the \naccordion while his mother played guitar.  \nI am truly lucky that people will allow me into their lives and talk to \nme and share their arts. When we went to Uspenka, the otherwise careful \nplanning of my various trips failed and we were not expected when we \narrived. At first the village akim, one of the few officials who was an \n', '179 \nREPORTS \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \nethnic Ukrainian, was quite hostile. But when I started interviewing some \nof the local residents, the akim and the other villagers whom he had \nsummoned decided that what we were doing was actually quite \ninteresting – they were able to learn about themselves as well as help me \nlearn. As a result, the akim offered to have us move into his home and \ndrove us all over everywhere, actually not giving me as much of an \nopportunity to stretch my legs as I would have liked. Again, I am most \nfortunate that I have an occupation that is useful to others. It allows me \nto travel and to learn. And incidents like the one in Uspenka reassure me \nthat I am not just getting something from the people I talk to, but giving \nsomething back. This essay is just the first of what I hope will be a \nnumber of pieces about Kazakhstan. I hope that the people I talked to as \nwell as the readers of these words benefit from my observations and my \nwork.  \n \n', '180 \n \nFOLKLORICA 2011, Vol. XVI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMap of Kazakhstan.
