And in\norder to give physical emphasis to their conten\ntion that the American people were to "win out"\nand ought not; to get "rattled" over merely tem\nporary setbacks or adverse factors in a given\nsituation 1hey quote the following summary from\none of the latest bulletins of the bureau of sta\ntistics at \'Washington:\n"The area of the continental I\'liited states\nwas 84:?.2."."i square miles in 180(1, advancing to\n1 ,7:i4,(i;!0 square miles in 1810; to 2.!0r,r.\'i(i square\nmiles in IS.")!); and .1,020,5.10 sipjare miles in 1853.\nsince -which date no change in area is shown. The\npopulation, which was five and one-third millions\nin 1800. was ninety-three and three-fonrlhs mil\nlions in lOll. Public debt, which Avas eighty-three\nl: i 11 .ion dollars in 1800, reached two thousand six\nhundred and seventy-live million dollars less cash\nin ircasury in 1805, 1he figures of 1011 being one\n\'thousand and fifteen million dollars. The per\ncapita debt, which was $15.01 in 1S00. and in\niSi ." was $7l.!)X. is in 101,1, $10.81. The interest\neliiirge per capita, which amounted to sixtv-four\ncents in 1S0O and $4.12 in 1S(i(i, was in 1011\nmi iy 21 cents; and the total annual interest\nhiM\'ge, which was in 1800 one hundred and forty\nsix million dollars. Mas in 1011 1venty-one and\n"out -third million dollars. Money in circulation,\nwhieh was in 1S00 $4.00, was in 1011 $14.15. De\nposits in all banks in the country cannot be\nshown earlier than 1875, at which date they are\nset down as a little over two billion dollars, and\nin 1010 they were over fifteen billion dollars.\nThe number of depositors in savings banks in\n1820. Ihe earliest year for which figures can be\nshown, was a little less than nine thousand, and\nin 101(1 over nine million. Government receipts.\n, which amounted to $2.04 per capita in 1800. were\nin I8tii; $14.05( and in 1011 $7.45. or about one\nfaif what they were in 1800. Exports of domestic\nmorchi\'.n.dke. which amounted to thirty-two mil\nlion dollars in value in 1800, Mere over two bil\nlion dollars in 1911; and imports, which amount\ned to ninety-one million dollars in 1800, were one\nand one-half billion in 1911.".\nThere is a heap of satisfaction, says the New\nYork Coninu reial, in all these figures, surely. A\ncountry that can go ahead like that in the first\ncentury or so of its existence with three or four\nimpoverishing wnrs on its hands meantime ean\nj\'ot easily go to the devil thus early in its sec\nond century So there is the very best reason\npossible why we should "hang our banners on\nthe outer Avails," set up a shout for a forward\nmarch and relegate all the pessimists and the lag\ngards to the rear. But at. the same time avo must\nlook facts squarely in the face and call things by\ntheir right names. There is a mighty host of\nreformers, progressives, up-lifters, Salvationists\n,\'nid political nondescripts stalking up and down\nthe country with long faces and longer tongues\npreaching a hcav doctrine of economic, and busi\nness ethics that all of our tremendous ncbievc\nnients of a century and a quarter has been\nAvrought by essentially wrong methods and by\nthoroughly vicious practices, that llie time has\ncome to destroy Hie whole pernicious system,\nthat they are the chosen leaders 1o conduct the\nmisguided masses into the right path and tin-\'\nthey have a scheme of legislation already mapped\nout for doing it.\nThe country is a big and rich and prosperous\nand promising, but it cannot afford to sit idly\niloAvn and rest on its laurels while that gang\nif Avonld-be destnyers is in the saddle. It would\no a fool not to recognize the national disaster\nhat they are capable of creating. Tt would be a\noward not to seek to Ihrotllc them AvhercAcr 1hey\nippear.\nTimes may be good or times may be bad. But\nhere is a public duty calling loudiy just hoav to\n11 good citizens.\nTHE TOUCH IN POLITICS.\nSenator Stephenson \'s expense account contains\nan item that is seldom jotted iIoavii in campaign\nexpenditures. Every candidate knows what\n"touches" mean. Every candidate is "touched"\nfor small sums on the plea of distress. Very feAv\ncandidates fail to fall to the "hard luck" story,\nlie knows that it is money throAva away, that\nthe story on which the request is made is mainly\na tielion. that the appeal to his sympathy is with\nout merit, but steel his heart as he may, he Avill\nsometimes yield to the importunities which beset\nhim wherever he goes. Jle gives small sums to\nthe grafters who touch any and all candidates\nwith broad impartiality, well knowing that Avhal\nhe gives in this way does not corrupt anybo.\nor gain him a vote. The candidate submits to Ihe\n"touch" to escape importunity and to avoid the\ncharges that he is deaf to the appeals of distress,\nlie knows that the appeal and the professions o:\ngoodwill which accompany it Avill be addressed\nto his opponent with as much unction as they are\naddressed to him.\nI\'nless he is utterly inexperienced in the ways\nof politics he is aware that the "striker" lies in\nwait for every candidate and works him for a\npiece by every artifice that the grafting mind can\nconjure up. Most candidates regard the money\ngiven to \'touchers" as money given or thrown\naway, it is a penalty he pays for being a candi\ndate for oflice. not as a legitimate campaign ex\npense, lie is well aware that the money so be\nstowed docs not assist him politically .but it is\nhuman nature to pay tribute to escape annoyance.\nSo the "touch" is an accepted part of the game,\none of the disagreeable consequences of running\nfor ol\'lii\'c. If Senator Stephenson got olf wit li $2\non the score of "touches" he plaved lucky or\nworked along thriftier lines than the average can\ndidate can folloAV. lie got off cheap, that is cer\ntain, lie must have turned away a great deal\npalromiyc offered him.

Hill, chairman of\nthe (livnt Northern- railroad board, put his finger\nsquarely on one great cause of the high cost of\nliving although he presumably had no such in\ntention immediately in mind. The reason for this\napproaching non-employment of men, he explain\ned, is that "our capacity for production along\nindustrial lines has grown faster than our con\nsumption along the same lines" which is strictly\ntrue, of course; if the country could take up\nami absorb and pay for nil the products of the\nforests, the mines, the rivers, tjie sea and so\nforth am! all the manufactures from raAV materials\nas fast as the labor of the country could turn\nthem out. there Avould be no industrial depression,\nno idle men "Some years ago," Chairman Hill\nproceeded to explain, "the farmer had to raise\nenough to feed himself and another man in the\ncities; hoav he must raise enough for himself and\nfor (avo oilier men, on account of the movement\nto industiy rather than farms." But the fact\nis that the Tanner isn\'t doing.it or isn\'t doing it\nUfast enough, at any rate; and the consequence is\nthat the price of most farm products is inordin\nately high nearly all the time, and even when the\ndemand for them might reasonably be expected to\nfall olf somewhat owing to a diminished purchas\ning capacity among the great armies of industrial\nAvorkers to whom Chairman Hill refers. If only a\nfew millions of the industrialists Avould turn to\nfanning or a feAv hundred thousands for that\ninalter idle men would soon become scarce, and\nthe prices of farm products would drop, but not\nto points below reasonable profit-levels for the\nfarmers. "Business is sound." the Great North\nern executive concluded, "but no neAV enterprises\nare being started. The politicians and neAA\'spapers\nare to blame. There is too much political ghost\ndancing. The people are not given the facts.\nThere is uncertainty as to the future on this ac\ncount rather than on account of the supreme\ncourt decision." Well, just where are the news\npapers to go for \'\'the fact?" Can Chairman Hill\nsuggest somebody to conduct a "campaign of\neducation" for them?\nTickets to the world\'s series baseball games\nre now selling at $10.

Clarence S.\nlartoAv, leading counsel for the defense, says\nthat he will object to every man who is a mem\nber of the Merchants\' and Manufacturers\' asso\nciation. The prosecution may attempt to exclude from\nservice every man who belongs to a labor organ\nization; and. in such an event, it Avouhl be only\nnatural for the defense to refuse to accept as a\njuror any non-union worker.\nThus Avitbout prejudice, anybody can see the\ncomplexity of the situation. The prospect that\nthe case Avill he dragged through nine months\nis not at all exaggerated. Nor is that indicating\na bitter struggle in which both sides are very\nliable to lose sight of the fact that the issue on\ntrial is one between the state of California and\nlames 11. McNamara and not one betAA\'een organ\nized labor and powerful interests that might\' be\npleased to see unionism destroyed.\nIt is to be hoped that the" judge will refuse\nto alloAv extraneous and irrelevant questions to\nbe injected into the case. From the bench he\ncan compel both the prosecution and the defense\nto proceed along lines that would respect both the\nspirit of the hiAV and the rights of the defend\nant. Were either side to be allowed free rein\nm objecting to veniremen, it would be impossible\nto obtain a jmy in Los Angeles or. for that\nmatter, anywhere else within a year.

His duties necessitate that he\nbe in touch with practically every\ncamp, and his intimate connection\nwith the production of various prop\nerties enables him to speak with authority.\n"The prospect for a revival of in\nterest in Nevada mines was never\nso great as it. is today, said Mr.\nManson to a Reno Gazette represen\ntative. "It Is in the air for a period\nof activity similar to the one which\nswept through the state when the\nriches of Tonopah and Goldfield\nwere being uncovered\'. There Is good\nnews freni every direction. The\ndiscoveries in the Wedekind are very\nimportant, for they will stimulate\ninterest in the field around Reno,\nwhich offers inviting possibilities to\nthe prospector. Humboldt county\nis now cue of the big producers.\nand we have lately learned of sev-\nral new finds east of here that\npromise well.\n"Lucky Boy is looking better, and.\not course, lonopah and Ooldnelu\nare at least as gocd us ever before\nin their history, if no even better.\n"If producing the stuff has any\nthing to do with it. and if people\ngenerally in the state will keep\nclear of exaggerated reports, whidi\nalways do definite harm, there Is\npractically no doubt that there will\nbe something doing in Nevada be\nfore long."\nTHE FLIGHT OF SEEDS.\nIt is popularly believed that wing\nd seeds fro nitrees trael to g;-eat\nil\'str.nces on the wind, but ;! in\nvestigations of a British scientist\nwho has spent much time at Singa\npore, indicate that winged seeds\nhave a far narrower ran.;e of flight\nthan have "powder" seeds and the\nplumed seeds. The greatest distance\ntraveled by the winged seeds of a\nforest tree observed by this author\nity was 100 yards. I\'nder the most\nfavorable circumstances, he calcu\nlates, it would take this plant just\n100 years to spread 300 yards and\n1,500,000 years to spread from the\nMalay peninsula to the Philippines\nif a land connection existed.
