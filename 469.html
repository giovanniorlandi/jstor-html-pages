IV.\nNOT SUPPORTED\nBT WILSON.\nFox and Vardanian Want\nit Understood.\nHIS ASSURANCE NOT DESIRED,\nCharged That Fox Was Brought\nInto Field by the Referee,\nWHICH IS DENOUNCED AS FALSE.\nWilson Regarded as Hoodoo, "heri\ntable Old Man of the Sea.\'\nSpecial to the Dally Progress.\nJackson, Feb. 26.—Edgar S. Wil\nthe political chameleon of\nson,\nMississippi, is occupying a most\nunique position in the gubernatorial\ncampaign and the state is being given\nits first instance of a negative in\nfluence, and the effects thereof.\nTwo of the principal candidates for\ngovernor, Congressman A. F. Fox\nand Major J. K. Vardanian, desire It\nto be distinctly understood that they\naxe not supported by the man who\nwas recently appointed referee of\nfederal patronage by\nRoosevelt, and the other aspirants\nfor the office have given out a quiet\nintimation that they do not desire his\nassurances of endorsement.\n"When Congressman Fox was an\nnounced as a candidate a few days\nPresident\nago it was charged that he was\nbrought into the field by Wilson and\naome of his followers. Upon hearing\nthis charge Mr. Fox denonuced it as\na falsehood and passed some very\nsevere criticisms on the federal\nofficeholder, whom he regards as a\ntraitor to democracy and only a luke\nwarm republican.\nBriefly stated, Wilson is regarded\nas a hoodoo, a veritable "old man of\nthe sea" by all of the candidates for\ngovernor, and it is the concensus of\nopinion among them that if Wilson\nshould openly declare himself in\nfavor of any particular candidate\nthat it would be equivalent to the\ndefeat of that aspirant.\nWilson endorsed the candidacy of\nJudge Pat Henry In the congres\nsional race in this district last sum\nmer, and it is stated that the publicity\nof this fact cost Judge Henry fully\non® thousand votes in the district.\nHis anti-influence wa9 particularly\nmanifested after his first fight on the\nstreets of Jackson with Congressman\nJohn Bharp Williams, who was\nelected by an overwhelming ma\njority, the incident making him\nmany votes that he did not expect to\nreceive.\nThe same inclination to dodge the\nendorsement of Wilson is being\nshown int the contests for other state\noffices, and in its geueral aspect the\nsituation\nphrases. It is stated that only a few\ndays since one of the candidates for\nstate office who was\nwalked three blocks out of his way\nto prevent a conversation with Wil\nson, fearing that if he appeared inti\nmate with the federal referee, and\nthe fact became publicly known, that\nit would ripple bis chances for office.\nhas broadly humorous\nin Jackson\nrv.\nm\nSPECIAL EXAMINATION\nWill Curtail Crops of Candidates\nfor the Office of County\nSuperintendent.\nBpefial to the Daily Progress.\nJackson, Feb. 26.-The ruling of\nAttorney-General Williams that all\ncandidates for the office of county\nperintendent of education must\nstand special examintion is expected\nto curtuail the crop of candidates for\nthat office in the various oounties.\nThe ruling applies not only to\ncandidates, but also to superintend\n•nts who offer for re-election,\nstate board of education will shortly\nappoint a date for the holding of ex\naminations in the various coun\'ies.\nSll\nnew\nThe\nFROM DEC! OF STEAMBOAT\nJudge Garrett Will Make His Can\nvass For the Legislature in\nLeake County.\n...4\nSpecial to the Daily Progress.\n26.—Judge L. M,\nJackson, Feb.\n■ Garrett, "the sage of Carthage," will\nM make the race for the legislature in\nLeake county this year in a very\nI novel manntfr. Leake is an interior\nB county, without railroad cornmunl\nB oatlon, and travel by buggy or horse\n-g-,\nback is beset with many difficulties.\nJudge Garrett has therefore decided\n\' to make his canvass from the deck\nof the little steamboat, "Belle of the\nBends 7 \' which is plying In the Pearl\nriver trade. The river flows diagon\nally across the county, and there are\nno less than twenty landings be\nj tween Edinburgh on the north\nI eastern border and Ludlow on the\nAnnounce\nsouthwestern border,\nmeat will be made of the dates when :\nthe steamer may be expected at j\nthese landings, and it is expected\nthat the populace for miles\naround will be assembled to hear\nforth\nthe Carthaginian pour\nbis eloquence from the deck of the\nsteamboat.\nHIDES AWAY IN BOX CAR.\nGovernor Saluted by 17 Guns\nFrom Cruiser Atlanta on De\nparture From Natchez.\nSpecial to the Daily Progress.\nNatchez, Miss., Feb. 35.—Shortly\nafter receiving a salute of seventeen\nguns from the United States cruiser\nAtlanta, Governor A. H. Longino,\nhere to attend the\nwho came\nNatchez Mardi Gras carnival, left\nthe city in a box car to return to\nJackson. The passenger coaches on\nthe Yazoo end Mississippi Valley\ntraiu were packed witli carnival\nvisitors leaving for their homes, and\nthere were a number of people in\nthe box car, Governor Longino said\nhe could stand it with the rest of the\nas\ncrowd.\nGovernor Longino is the first chief\nof Mississippi to be\nexecutive\nhonored by a salute from an Ameri\nman-of-war lying at a Missis\ncan\nsippi port.\nThe cruiser Atlanta has been\nordered to New Orleans, and leaves\nstopping two days at\ntomorrow,\nBaton Rouge. At New Orleaus the\nAtlanta will receive a new anchor\nshipped from Boston to replace the\none lost near Bayou Sara.\nMURDERER CAPTURED.\nTom Williams, the Negro Who\nShot and Killed a Compaion\nNamed Willis.\nSpecial to the Daily Progress.\nJackson, Feb. 26.—Tom Williams,\nthe negro who shot and killed a\ncompanion named W lllis in the\nsouthern part of Hinds county, has\nbeen captured and placed in jail at\nRaymond to await the next session\nof the circuit court.\nPECULIAR HOTEL.\n"In a little town in tlie backwoods\nof Mississippi," remaked a traveling\nto the Birmingham Age-Herald,\nIt is just\nman\n"there is a peculiar hotel,\nlike any other hotel, except in the\nthe rooms are named.\nThey are\nway\nnot numbered, as is generally done,\nbut each room is named for a state of\nthe United States. When I stopped at\nthe place I was assignd to the room\nIt was correctly\ncalled \'Delaware.\'\nnamed, too, for it was one of the\nsmallest rooms in tlie house,\nwho was occupying \'New Hampshire\'\nmade compliant to the landlord that\nthe man in \'Main\' was drunk and\nboisterous, and was thus keeping\nThis seemed strange, when\nrecall that Main is a prohibitin\nTwo men up in \'Montana\'\nkeeping up the reputation of the\nwild west by engaging in a noisy poker\nA big fat capitalist had \'New\nA man\nawake.\nwe\nstate.\nwere\ngame.\nYork,\' which was the best room in\nnamed for\nthe house.

Because yon will find a country of\nj rich soil and waiting the settler.\nBecause there are uplands, prairie\n| lands and alluvial river bottoms.\nBecause you can be certain of profi\nI table returns from whatever you put\nj into the soil.\nBecause the winter does consume\nwhat the summer produces.\nBecause there are more and better\nopportunities for diversified farming\n\' than elsewhere.\nBecause the seasons are regular and\nno fear of crop failure.\nBecause the country is never scourg\ned by cyclones and devastating storms\nand blizzards.\nBecause no better fruit county is\nknown; oranges, plums, pears, apples,\npeaches, grapes, strawberries, figs,\npecans and others fnlly mature.\nBecause everything grown else\nwhere can he produced here more\nabundantly.\nBecause truck farming is a success;\nproducts, being early in the market,\nobtain higher prices.\nBecause there are more cliauce9 for\nprofitable investment of capital than\nelsewhere in tliis country.\nBecause for healthfulness this sec\ntion is uueqnaled on the face of the\nglobe.\nBecause you have no long winter\nmonths to encounter, with no exces\nsive dry heat in the summer.\nBecause the climate is more uniform\nthan elsewhere, no extreme of heat or\ncold.\nBecause you will find the most open\nhearted people on earth.\nBecause education is paramount;\npublic schools and churches of every\ndenoraiation are to be found in all\ncommunities.—Mississippi Journal.\nTHE FRILLS DID IT.\nTitles sometimes even impress the\nmessengers who are in attendance at\nthe doors of the secretaries of the\nvarious departmnts, says the New\nYork World.\n"Take my card to Mr. Root,\'\'\nsaid Representaive Snlzer, walking\nup to the messenger on duty at the\ndoor of the secretary of war.\n"Sorry, sir, but the secretary ain\'t\nseeing any one today, answered the\nmessenger, who had been turning\naway senators and representatives all\nday.\n\' But I\'m Representative Snlzer of\nNewYork. \'\'\n"Can\'t take your card in, sir.\nYou tell the secretary that Re\npresentative Sulzer of New York, the\nranking member of the minority of\nthe committee on military affairs of\nthe house of representatives, wants to\nsee him.\'\'\nThe messenger was overpowered and\nstepped inside of the room, and re\nturning, threw the door wide open,\nsaying: "Walk right in, sir. The\nsecretary will see you.\'\'\nJ *\n^ i\nSTOCK LAW AND ROADS\nThe Latter Receiving Considerable\nAttention at the Hands of the\nBoards of Supervisors.\nJackson, Feb.. 25.—Extension of\nstock law lines and working pubic\nroads by contract are two of the lead\ning issues that are engaging the at\ntention of the press of Mississippi, and\nin quite a number of counties they\nhave been injected into the political\ncampaign. A strong sentiment is be\ning manifested in favor of more strin\ngent stock law ordinances, and as\nthese measures always provoke spirit\ned contests and much personal feeling\namong tlie farmers, the issue is being\nhandled quite gingerly by the candi\ndates, and much skillful side-step\nping is being indulged in. On the\nquestion of good roads, however,\nthere is but little variance of opinion,\nand the chief obstacle to the improve\nment of the public highways system is\nthe reluctance of boards of supervisors\nto set aside sufficient money for the\npurpose, particularly at a season when\nthey desire to make a display of eco\nnomy to impress the class of voters\nwho keep a careful eye on the county\n1 treasury and the expenditures there\nfrom. During the past month several\ncounties have adopted the contract sys\ntem of working tlie public roads, and\nI in a few instances skilled road bnil\nI ders have been retained at good sala\n|;ries"to supervise the work.\nThe One Day Cold cure.\nKermott\'s Chocolates Laxative Quinine foi\ntold in Ui\' head and sore throat Children\nlake their. *ike candj.', 'PUBLISHED EVERY EVENINQ,\nExcept Sunday,\nAd, ertlslng rates made known on\napplication to this office.\nme\'Ml at the postoffice at Hattiesburg, Mias,\nas second-class mall matter.\nBy W.

While no other candidate has\nannounced for the office up to the\npresent time there is no doubt that\nothers will enter the race when there\nwill become a lively scramble.\nSenator Pettus\' re-election cost him\nonly one dollar and some of the candi\ndates of this state are wondering how\nit was done. It will cost the caudi\nh cites for governor of this state one or\ntwo thousand dollars to make\'\'the\ncampaign and then all of tliemjjjwill\nnot be elected.\nAway hack in 1852 the Vciksburg,\n.Jackson and Brandon railroad adver\ntised that, it would carry children\nand negroes at half fare. But a negro\nwas a negro in those days. He is a\ndark skin Whiteman now and the fare\nis the same as that charged the white\nskin white man.\n.Tames Hill, who is one of the big\ngest colored politiciansjin the state, is\nplaced in a position now Yo lie can talk\nbuck at Roosevelt whenever an occa\nsion presents itself. A fewj\'days ago\nlie started a newspaper and at once\nHis\nopened the ball in a gentle way.\npaper will talk out in school against\nTeddy and his henchmen, and if Hill\nclnses to do so lie can mako it rather\nThe first edition\nwarm for them,\nwas given to the pubic the other day\nand contained somo far-minded, con\nservative editorials.\nAll Mr. Hill\ndesires is that the negro be treated\nright. He does not expect them to\nhold office, hut expects them to be\ntreated as American citizens. They\nare here among the white people and\nhave no desire to leave.\nThe Hon. E. F. Noel is not allowing\nany grass to grow under liis feet.\nHe is here today, yonder tomorrow\nand elsewhere the next day. He is\nfollowing up the courts, which give\nhim ample time to present his side of\nthe case to the voters, and doubtless\nhe is making good use of the oppor\ntunity. He is a fluent speaker, a\nstrong debater and has his pockets full\nof figures and facts which he never\nfails to produce. He has no one to\njaw with and knows how to take ad\nvantage of those inclined to jaw. The\ngentleman from Holmess is going into\nthe August primary with a good fol\nlowing, and living near Mr. Varda\nnian\'s county he may succeed in gob\nbling up some of the votes claimed\nby that gentleman.\nAnd what of Wiley N. Nash? It\nwas stated in the outset that he would\nbe a candidate for governor and up to\nthe present he has never denied the\n\'•soft impeachment.\'\'On the contrary\nlie lias rather signified his intention\nof entering the race as it has been\nstated by a Starkville paper,\ncomes in it will make six avowed can\ndidates for the office, when we shall\nmove that the books be closed. Six\ncandidates, with four of them practi\ncally from the same section of the\nstate, would seem to be sufficient for\none campaign. From the best infor\nmation that can be bad there seems to\nbe no doubt of the entry of Mr. Nash,\nthough he hasn\'t given liis consent and\nmay, after further deliberation, con\nclude not to be an aspirant. Since it\nis charged that Mr. Fox was brought\nout to defeat Mr. Vardanian perhaps\nMr. Nash will be brought out to de\nfeat Mr. Fox, when Mr. Noel would\nstand a good chanoe to get the per\nsimmon.\nIf he\nThe Alabama leg islatnre is wrest\nling with the railroad commission\nquestion. J. C. Rich, a member of\nthe legislature from the Mobile dis\ntrict, is opposed to the election of the\ncommissioners, but think they should\nbe appointed. We do not know how\nit is over in Alabama, but in this\nstate nearly every office is filled by an\nelection. Whether or not this is the\nproper way is a matter that has not\n1 1 en fully discussed, except that of\n1. distriet judges. It might, how\never, be better if the state would u?e\nthe appointive power a little more\nand thus divorce some of the offices\nfrom politics. In an interview witli\nthe Mobile Register Mr. Rich gives\nthe following as some of his reasons\nfor objecting to the eleetiou of rail\nroad commissioners: "Sofaraslam!\npersonally concerned I think the elec\ntion of a railroad commissioner would\nbe a menace to the state. It would\nput the railroads into the realm of ac\ntive politics and invlove the entire\nstate in the mire of fraud and corrup\ntion. The railroads would be certain\nto protect their interests on every\nhand and in every way. It would be\nnecessary for them to fortify themsel\nselves in every hand to circumvent the\ntrickery and chickaury of dishonorable\nmen, and to protect themselves in the\nmost invincible manner against their\nmachinations. The trouble would be\nthat the elected man might, and cer\ntainly would, do anything against\nthe property of the railroads, no mat\nter what they might destroy,\nelection of the commissioners would\noften mean the selection of incom\npotent men who were put in office be\ncause of popularity and not by reason\nof any special fitness for the position. "\nThe\nSOME WITH A WALKOVER.\nThere are some state offices for which\nthere are only one aspirant for each\nso far and of course these candidiates\nwill have a walkover, so to speak.\nThere is only one candidate for lieu\ntenant-governor, W. G. Kiger of\nWarren, and it is very likely that he\nwill have no opposition. He lias been\nin the legislature for a long time and\nis considered a good man with splen\ndid executive abilities.\nE. H. Nall fo Holmes is the only\ncandidate so far for land commissioner\nand will go through with a whoop.\nHe has held the office for a long time\nand is familiar with every detail of\nit as any one could very well be.\nHe is clever, accommodating and pop\nular wherever known—and he is\nknwou all over the state.\nWilliam Williams is the only candi\ndate so far for office of attorney-!\ngeneral. He was reared between the\nplowhandles in Simpson county,\nyoung and active, and lias a fine\nrecord at home. The report lias been\ncirculated that lie is not a very learn\ned lawyer and that lie is incompetent\nto fill the high office of attorney-gen\neral. but this report may have sprung\nfrom some one who had an eye on the\noffice for himself or a friend. Since\nthis report has been put out it is very\nlikely that he will have opposition\nand lie may have to fight for the\nplace. There are many lawyers in\nthe state who would be more than\npleased to fill the office and some of\nthem will make an effort to gobble up\nthe plum.\nOf course Henry W. Whitfield will\nbe returned as superintendent of educa\ntion. He is from the free state of\nRankin and has perhaps done more\nreal good for the public schools of the\nstate than any others of his predeces\nsors. He is a young man, handsome,\nlike all the Rankinites, a man of fine\neduaction, and devotes all his time\nand energies to the work. He is\nthoroughly familiar with the work\nings of the office and will have no op\nposition this time. The state could\nscarcely do without his services, es\npecially since he has mapped out\nwork to he done that no other could\nscarcely do.\nJohn D.McInnis is a candidate for\nrailroad commissioner to succeed him\nself from the middle district. He is\nfrom Lauderdale ad is looked upon as\nthe boss of the commission, being its\npresident. It. is likely he will go in,\nthough lie has some opposition, Dr. S.\nR. Dunn of Washington having enter\ned the field. But Mr. Mcluuis lias\ndecidedly the advantage, having held\nthe office for many years, duriug\nwhich time lie has made many friends\nall over the state. He is an old con\nfederate veteran and the old vets and\nall their sous will vote for him.\nE. W. Brown, from the free state\nof Copiah, clerk of the supreme court,\nis a candidate for re-election. He has\nthe place for many years and is likely\nto remain where he is until lie be\ncomes tired of the place, which may\nnot be for years to come. He lias\nopposition in the person of George C.\nMeyers of Marshall, but it is not pre\nsumed that Mr. Brown will be turned\ndown, though we know nothing about\nthe strength of his opponent from\nMarshall.\nOf course Wirt Adams will retain his\noffice as state revenue agent. No\nother can fill the place like he has\nand no other could have gotten as\nmuch money out of back taxes as he\nhas gotten the past two years,\nwill hold on without any opposition\nand will continue to make hauls as\nlong as there is anything to haul.\nW. Q. Cole of Yalobusha will con\ntinue to hold the office of insurance\ncommissioner. What he does not\nknow about the insurance business is\nnot in the book. He has worked it 1\ndown to a fine point and has given |\ngeneral satisfaction. He will go in\nwithout any opposition—at least no ;\none has offered to oppose him so far j\nGovernor, secretary of state, audi- i\ntor and the northern and southern rail- j\nroad commission disrticts ail have op- !\npositin, there being from two to six\ncandidates for each office. |\nHe\n:\ni\nj\nj\nj\n!\n|\nj\nj\nj\nRemoval Sale\nHaving rented the First National\nBank Building I\'ll move in as soon\nas they move to their new building.\nI desire to dispose of a few of my\nspecial good bargains to save "move\ning expenses" among the leaders are:\nThe Champenois handsome resi\ndence on Bay Street.\nThe J.
