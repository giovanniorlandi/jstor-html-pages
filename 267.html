        <pre>['THE RONAN PIONEER\nEntered as second-class matter May 12, 1910, at the post Located in the Heart of the Great Flathead Indian Rcscrvation\noffice at Ronan, Montana, under the Act of March 3, 1879\nVolume III. No. 9. RONAN, MISSOULA COUNTY. MONTANA, JUNE 28, 1912. $2 Per Year\nSTEAM ROLLER TO BALTIMORE\nDemocrats Refuse\nto Accept Bryan\nPARKER TEMPORARY GHAIRMAN\nThe democratic convention\nmet in Baltimore Tuesday and\nwas called to order at 1i2:16 p.\nm., and the first order of busi\nness was the election of a tem\nporary chairman. Chairman\nMack presented the name of\nAlton B. Parker of New York,\nwho had been selected by the\nnational committee, but William\nJ. Bryan at once arose and pre\nsented the name of Senator John\nW. Kern of Indiana. Mr. Bryan\nmade one of the greatest speeches\'\nof his career, in so doing, but at\nits conclusion Senator Kern\narose and declined the honor,\nand named Mr. Bryan. The\nthrice nominee of the democratic\nparty accepted the task of at\ntempting to defeat Parker, say\ning he had favored any man who\nwas known as a progressive, but\nas none of them would be a can\ndidate, he would. A roll call\ndemonstrated that the steam rol\nler had moved to Baltimore, as\nhe was flattened as smoothly as\nthe valiant Theodore was at Chi\ncago. The vote was Parker 579,\nBryan 506.\nTemporary Chairman Parker\nthen attempted to deliver the\nspeech he had prepared, but the\nconfusion was so great an ad\njournment was taken until 8 p.\nm., at which time the convention\nmet and listened to it. The speech\nwas fairly good, showing that\nthe speaker intended saying\nnothing to injure Mr. Taft, but,\nwas hot shot for Teddy. TheI\nevident intention being to help\nelect Taft if a democrat cannot\nbe elected.\nThe Montana delegation voted\'\nBryan 7, Parker 1.\nT. J. Walsh is chairman of the\'I\nmontana delegation and the com\nmittee assignments are as fol\nlows: Credentials, Sid J. Coffee;\npermanent organization and or-;\nder of business, R. R. Purcell;\nrules, M. E. Baldwin; committee\nto notify presidential candidate,\nSenator Henry L. Myers; com\nmittee to notify vice-presidential\nnominee, W. J. Johnson; resolu\ntions, Gov. E. L. Norris.\nWednesday the Bryan forces\nwere on top, by winning the,\nfight to make nominations before\'\nthe the platform was adopted.\nThis course was persued for the\nreason that Mr. Bryan says he is\nnot in accord with the officers of,\nthe convention nor the national\ncommittee. Mr. Bryan was twice\'\noffered the chairmanship of the\ncommittee on resolutions but\nboth times he refused, saying\'\nthat he wished to be in a posi\ntion to submit a minority report\nif the committee\'s report is not\nsatisfactory to him. In declining\nhe said: "We used to have two\nkinds of democrats, progressive E\nand conservative; now we only\nhave one kind, progressive, but\nwe find there is a wide difference\nin the definition of the word\n\'progressive.\' I do not define ,\nprogressive as it is defined by a\nmajority of this convention and E\nI desire to be more free to repre- i\nsent the minority sentiment."\nSenator Kern was then elected 1\nchairman of the committee. Ollie I\nJames, senator elect from Ken\ntucky, and a Bryan man, has\'\nbeen selected as permanent:\nchairman, but no progress has (\nbeen made toward nominating a\npresidential candidate.\n.Some adhere to the belief that\nno other man but Bryan can be\nnominated and others say that\nBryan is eliminated from among\nthe possible candidates.\nThat Bryan and Senator La\n1 Follette have been in consulta\nI:tion in Baltimore is absolute\n\'known but neither one will say\n- a word as to what it was about.\n- There is much fear among demo\ncrats opposed to Bryan that he\nwill take a part in the formation\nof a third party in conjunction\nLaFollette.\nRONAN WINS AGAIN i\nRONAN 13, DIXON 4\nThe game at Dixon last Sun\nday resulted in another victory\nfor the Ronan team, the score\nstanding 13 to 4 in favor of the\nlocals.\nQuite a crowd went down from\nRonan to see the game and some\n!went down intending to go on to\nPlains for the day, but were pre\n1 vented from so doing by reason\nSof all the trains being off sched\n,ule time.\nIt was rumored that Dixon I\nhad strengthened their team\nwith hopes of winning this event, c\nbut if they had then the boys\nhere must be improviug along\n\'with the practice and getting\neven stronger than we thought\nthey were. The battery for Ro\nnan was Wagner Bros. as usual,\nand Buell and Bedard for Dixon.\nThe game was not as interesting\nas if it had been more even, but\nit was good practice even at that.\niTHOMPSON FALLS WIL PLAY\nt IN RONAN ON THE FOURTH\nManager Carper made arrange\nments with the Thompson Falls\nteam Monday evening to come\nhere for a game on the fourth.\nThere has been a desire on the\n\' part of both teams for a game\nbut circumstances have pre\ne vented a game being made until\nnow. The Thompson Falls team\nis a strong one and everybody\niwho loves the game will get\n_ their moneys worth by coming to\nRonan on the Fourth and attend\ning the game.\nS There will be another good\ne game here in the forenoon of\ne that day, between the Reclama\ntion and St. Ignatius, and this\nB will give plenty of sport in that\ns line for the day.\nIt was supposed that the Ro\nnan team would play Poison on\nthe Fourth but this thought was\ndissipated Monday last and other\narrangements made.\nChurch Notice, June 30\nt There will be preaching ser\nr vices in the Methodist church\n· next Sunday, both morning and\nevening. This will be the fourth\nr quarterly meeting occasion and\nt the elements of the Lord\'s sup\nper will be administered in the\nI morning. District Superinten\ndent 0. A. White will preach in\nI the evening. Quarterly confer\n. ence business meeting will be\n/ held Monday morning at9 o\'clock.\nThere will be services at the\nI Mud creek school house at 3:30\np. m.\n- R. W. Newman and A.

S.\nPaxson will have completed the\nlast two of his six mural paint\na ings for the west wing of the\ncapitol building. The two under\ns process of completion now are:\n"The Surrender of Chief Joseph"\nand "The Border Land."\nFour of the pictures are com\npleted. One shows Pierre de la\nVerendrye when he first travy\neled into the Big Horn country\nand west to the continental di\nvide hoping to see the Pacific\nocean, in 1743.\nA second picture shows "Lew\nis at Black Eagle Falls" on the\nway westward up the Missouri.\n1After Lewis had been rejoined\nby Clark at this place with the\n- boats, a portage was made and\nthe party proceeded up the river\nto Three Forks, where Captain\nClark turned up the Jefferson,\ne then crossed the range to the\nMadison, and there again joined\n-Lewis, who was then in com\n1 mand of the boats. Mr. Paxson\nhas shown the party at Three\nForks with the Shoshone Indian\nt woman, Sacajawea, pointing to\nthe land of her people in the\n- west. She was found by the\nparty in the Mandan village\nI where they spent their first win\nf ter and came west with her Man\ndan husband to show the way.\ns When she joined the party she\nt was but 15 years old and had\nbeen brought from the Shoshone\ncountry six years before by a\nMandan war party.\nThe fourth panel now in place\nis entitled, "After the White\nMan\'s Book." It shows the\nthree Flathead braves, the chief\nmeniof the tribe, who were sent\nto St. Louis by the tribe to get\nthe book which should tell them\nof the white man\'s God. A trap\nper had told the Indians that\nthis book would tell them all\nabout the true God, and they\ntribal council decided they must\nhave it. The picture shows their\nstart, with the mountains in the\nbackground. Two of the braves\nnever returned from the perilous\njourney, being victims of yellow\nfever after they reached their\ngoal. They were greeted at St.\nLouis by Capt. Clark. The third\nreturned, ragged, hungry, weary\nand without the book.\nRonan State Bank has opened\nI a savings department.\nIIHOMESTIEADERS\nMUST SELECT\nThe thrree year homestead law\na provided homestead entrymen\n- must elect as to whether they\nwill make proof under the new\nr law or under the law under\nwhich they made the entry.\nA recent circular issued by the\ncommissioner of the general land\n- office, is as follows:\nThere is printed below a copy\n- of an act passed by congress,\nand signed by the president on\nJune 6, 1912, amending sections\n2291 and 2297 of the Revised\nStatutes of the United States re\nlating to homesteads and home\nstead entries. I call your par\nticular attention to the last pro\nviso to section 2291, reading as\nfollows:\nProvided, That the secretary\nof the interior shall, within sixty\ndays after the passage of this\nact, send a copy of the same to\neach homestead entryman of\nrecord who may be affected\nthereby by ordinary mail to his\nlast known address, and any\nsuch entryman may, by giving\nnotice within one hundred and\ntwenty days after the passage of\nthis act, by registered letter to\nthe register and receiver of the\nlocal land office, elect to make\nproof upon his entry under the\nlaw under which the same was\nmade without regard to the pro\nvisions of this act.\nIf you wish to elect to make\nproof upon your entry under the\nlaw under which the same was\nmade, you must give notice\nthereof within 120 days after\nJune 6, 1912, to the register and\nreceiver of the local land office.\nThis notice must be sent by reg\nistered mail and may not be sent\nin any other way. If, in your\ncase, you desire to make proof\nunder the law under which you\nmade your entry, there is, for\nyour convenience, inclosed here\nwith a printed notice of election,\nwhich you may fill out and use\nfor that purpose.\nUnless you elect in the man\nner and form and within the\ntime above stated your entry\nwill, without notice, become sub\nject to the provisions of said act\nof June 6, 1912; and in reaching\na decision as to which course you\n* prefer you should first carefully\nexamine the provisions and re\nquirements of the new act print\nled herewith.\nVery respectfully.\nFRED DENNETT,\nCommissioner.\nBoard by the day or week at\nChas. Dorris\' boarding house.\nBy the week room and board\n1$7.00. All kinds of bakery goods\nfor sale at all times. Near the\nReservation Land & Lumber Co.\nplaning mill.\nDELIGHTFUL SUNDAY RIDE\nLast Sunday three auto loads\nof Ronan people made the trip\nto Missoula, mostly to see the\ndouble header base ball game be\ntween Salt Lake and Missoula.\nThe first load started at 5:30\nand was composed of A. M.\nSterling, Geo. E. Broughton,\nAlbin Larson and C. F. Rath\nbone, with Jimmy Dudley as\nchauffeur, driving the Crawford\n& Clairmont Overland. The\nearly morning was delightful for\nthe ride, and passing through a\ncountry which for natural\'beauty\ncannot be equalled anywhere,\nwith growing crops on each side\nof the road almost all the way to\nSt. Ignatius, nothing lacking but:\nthe moisture to mature them,\nand it seemed a crime that with\nso much water in all the creeks\nrunning to waste, that the farm.\ners were not permitted to turn it\nupon the parching fields and\nbring forth the harvest in abun\ndance. St. Ignatius was still\nasleep, except that we saw Joe\nMichaud up and around prepar\ning to feed the people at the\nMission hotel. On to Ravalli we\nsped, over the best piece of road\non the reservation, newly im\nproved and made wide enough to\npass vehicles at almost any point.\nBreakfast was had at the Bate\nman hostelry and after a delay\nof 35 minutes for this purpose,\nit was off for Missouia. From\nRavalli, the ride is simply de\nlightful, the scenery being much\nmore enjoyable from an auto\nthan from the windows of a pas-,\nsenger car on a railroad. The 4\nroad winds in and out of the]\ntimber, crosses the river several :\ntimes over, fine steel bridges,\n(that portion will probably al\nways remainin Missoula county)\nand in many instances irrigated\nfields of hay and grain are found\non each side of the road. The\nreclamation service has allowed\nthe water of that part of the\nproject used and the beneficial\nresults can be seen by a novice.\nFine fields of hay arid grain are\nshowing the effect of water and\nthere is no question about\nwhether they are to have a crop\nor not-a crop is certain.\nIt is after one commences to\nclimb the Evaro hill that the full\nbeauty of the ride is realized.\nThrough the timber with abun\ndant verdure on every hand, a\nsplendid mountain road, every\nmoment a changing scene, equal\nto a kaleidoscope, the twisting\nand turning continues until all\nat once we glide out of the nar\nrow path into a valley with con\ntented farmers and surrounded\nwith every comfort and conven\nience of a farmers\' life. From\nhere into Missoulo the road is a\nreal road, turnpiked and put into\nthe best of condition, and is\nprobably not used by one-tenth\nthe people one day with another\nas the road between Ronan and\nSt. Ignatius, where it is not all\nthat could be wished nor all that\nit could be made.\nThe two games at Missoula\nthat day were fine exhibitions of\nball playing, each team winning\na game, the first going to Salt\'\nLake by a score of 9 to 5, and,\nthe last to Missoula by a score of\n5 to 2.\nOne auto load consisted of A.\nM. Thornburgh, Bolivar Scearce,\nRoy Boyd, Jim Murtaugh, Justus\nRathbone, Joe Bouchard, Jr.,\nand Harvey Cox driving the\nPierce-Arrow. The other Ioal\nwas Cliff Welch, Howard Stans\nbury, B. J. Schaerer, Cy Yeager\nand Ed Burtride.\nAfter the games were over, it\nwas back to Ronan as soon as\npossible, and leaving Missoula at\n7 o\'clock in the evening, the run\nwas made without mishap arid at\n12 o\'clock the two first named\ncars were in town. Cliff Welch\nand party started home about 4\no\'clock and were here shortly\nafter nine.\nConsidering everything, it was\none of the most pleasant rides\nthe writer ever enjoyed, the\nwhole trip being a pleasure from\ntime of leaving until arriving\nhome.\nVERY IMPORTANT ARRIVAL\nKNOCKS ON HEAVEN\'S GATE\nA hardware man of Birming\nham, Alabama, in attendance at\nthe hardware mens\' convention\nat Nashville recently, told his\nlisteners a good St. Peter story\nwith one condition that every\nbody was enjoined to keep it a\nsecret. Someone failed to abide\nby the condition and the story is\nas follows:\n"St. Peter was aroused by a\nknocking on the gate of heaven\nand upon inquiring who was\nwithout received this reply,\n"George Washington."\nWhat have you done to merit\nheaven." asked the Saint.\n"I helped to establish a great\nnation," was the modest rejoin\nder, whereupon the father of his\ncountry was invited to enter.\n"A few decades after a tall,\ncadaverous individual presented\nhimself at the pearly gates and\nrequested admission. "Who are\nyou," asked St. Peter. "I am\nAbraham Lincoln," was the re\nply. Of course the great eman\ncipator was assigned one of the\nhigh seats in heaven,\n"After the passage of a few\nmore decades, there came a ter\nrific hammering upon the golden\ngates and St. Peter, in much\ntrepidation, hastened to ascer\ntain the cause of the racket.\nLooking timdly out, he saw a\npompous individual in a rough\nrider\'s uniform and bandishing a\nbig stick.\n"Who are you," asked St. Pe\nter, tremulously.\n"None of your business who I\nan," came the tart reply, "just\ntell God I\'m here."\nMOUNTAIN STATES TEL.\nCO. FURNISHES BULLETINS\nLast week during the republi\ncan national fiasco and during\nthis week while the democrats\nhave been in convention at Balti\nmore, the Mountain States Tele\nphone company supplied bulletins\ngiving the news of the conven\ntions as soon as anything hap\npened. This service was given\ngratis and was appreciated by\'\neverybody. To wait for the daily\npapers is to great a strain on the\nnervous system and while the\nnews was not of the kind one\nwanted, the spirit in which the\nbulletins were furnished was\nappreciated.\nMore Airedales\nFrank Denison received a\nthoroughbred Airedale terrier\nSunday last from Canada, but\npreviously imported from Eng\nland. He has another on the\nroad from Depot, Virginia, which\nin of the Airedale strain also.\nMr. Denison believes he will have\nupon the arrival of the last dog,\nthe best collection of Airedales\nin the state and takes great pride\nin showing them to dog fanciers.', 'TAFT AND SHERMAN CHOSEN;\nT.R.\'S NAME IS WITH ELD\n- . - __ ,. _____.\nPresident\'s Forces\nFirm All Through,\nCONVENTION RESUME,\nColonlI Personally Nominated\nby Own Delegates\nPLATFORM IS CONSERVATIVE,\nHarding\'s Nomination Speech\nLauds the President.\nREPUBLICAN TICKET.\nFor President,\nWILLIAM HOWARD TAFT.\nFor Vice President,\nJAMES SCHOOLCRAFT SHER\nMAN.\nChicago, June 23.-The split has\ncome.

It seems\nstrange that 540 men could be\nsent to a republican convention,\nand with so little regard for\nparty success, to renominate\nPresident Taft for another term,\nwhen such action means certain\ndefeat. Not that the nomination\nof Roosevelt would have been\nthe proper thing, but to the un\nbiased mind it seems like a third\nperson could have been found\nwho would have been acceptable\nto the party and thereby avoided\njust what happened.\nTo wreck a party which has\nstood for so much during the\npast 56 years to simply gratify\nthe ambition of two men, is a\ncrime which the delegates to the\nnational convention should be\nconvicted of and punished by\nbeing neve.I again placed in the\nleadership of the party. The\nwillingness to sacrifice every\nthing in order that either Taft or\nRoosevelt might secure the nom\nination, is all that concerned the\ndelegates who favored one or the\nother of those two men. To\nsatisfy the whim or prejudice of\none man, a great party is now\ndoomed to defeat, and it matters\nvery little who the opposition\nnames.\nTo say that it was a conflict\nbetween progressives and reac\ntionaries and such a fight as was\nnot susceptible of a compromise,\nis begging the question. If it\nwere not possible for the party\nto nominate a man with extreme\nviews toward progressive prin\nciples, nor a man with standpat\nprinciples, then why could there\nnot have been a man selected\nwith middle ground views, who\nwould not have disrupted the\nparty entirely and made all the\nchances of election impossible.\nThere are certainly men with the\nability to fill the office who\nare not so radical either way who\ncould have been nominated.\nGov. Hadley, Senator Cummins,\nEx-Senator Beveridge, Senator\nBorah, of the progressive ranks,\nSenator Lodge, Senator Burton,\nCharles W. Fairbanks, or many\nothers alligned with the opposi\ntion, might have been named and\nany one of them would have\nunited the party for the cam\npaign this fall. Opposed to this\naction was the ambition of Roose\nvelt to set aside the third term\npolicy of the country and gratify\nhis only ambition, as against the\ndetermination of certain men\nand interests to force the renom\nination of President Taft. It\nseems strange thot enough men\nwere to be found assembled at\nthat convention who could be\nmade to do as they did.\nThe result will be that many\nmen who have heretofore stead\nfastly voted the republican ticket\nwill cast their ballots for neither\nof them. The democratic candi\ndate will fall heir to many of\nthese votes and the socialist can\ndidate will receive a surprisingly\nlarge vote. It makes the elec\ntion of a democrat almost cer\ntain, and with Bryan nominated\nthere would be no doubt of it.\nProgressive republicans will wel\ncome with pleasure an opportun\nity to so vote, knowing full well\nthat by so doing they are voting\nfor a man who has at all times\nbeen in the lead on this issue,\nand knowing full well at the\n,same time that they are voting\nfor a man who has a cinch on\nbeing elected. It is merely a\nquestion of whether or not the\nr democrats will be dominated by\nthe same influence which forced\n- the nomination of Taft or of the\nmen who prevented a compro\n- mise being made by insisting\n14 upon the nomination of none\nother but Roosevelt.\nIt is to be hoped that four\nyears from now there will not be\nra convention held, but that the\nvoters will be permitted to nom\n- inate direct and not leave it pos\nsible for such disgraceful things\nto be done as the Chicago con\nvention performed. The conven\ntion system was rotten at the\n11 start and grew worse with age.\na It is now almost July and the\n1, trustees of district No. 28, have\n,s taken no iniative to provide Ro\ne nan with additional schools for\nthe ensuing year. With only two\nr rooms and the number of pupils\ne sufficient to fill five or six rooms.\n, it looks like criminal negligence\nn to procrastinate in this manner.\nn None of the teachers employed\nn have been assigned their schools\neither, although there is a de\nj mand on their part to know\nd something about what they may\ne expect. The chairman\'s failure\nd to call a meeting of the trustees,\namounts to a refusal to do so,\ns and the Ronan members D. N.\ne Mason and Dr. Resner have re\ny quested a meeting and still the\na chairman has not done so. What\ne this district needs is a change in\ne the personel of the trustees by\ny the removal from office of the\ne members of the board who are\ne failing to do their duty.\nFreak Heads of Bald Barley\nAlex Laflemme brought in a\ne sample of freak heads of bald\ne barley last Saturday which he\no will attempt to propigate. This\nbarley is of the ordinary kind,\nV except that several additional\ns heads are growing alongside the\noriginal head, which would in\ncrease the yield to at least double\nSwhat is ordinarily produced. The\nthree additional heads will make\none more of usual length and all\nare apparently well filled.\nt -__ ___\nRy eport of the Condition of\nie The Ronan State Bank,\nAt Ronan, in the State of Montana, at\nthe close of business June 14, 1912.\nit RESOURCES\nLoans and discounts.......-.. $69,057 23\nOverdrafts, secured and unsecured 2:5 19\nd --- $70,072 4·2\nBanking house furniture and\nfixt-ues ..... 6,118151\nOther real estate owned .... 7980\nie Cash reserve in bank, vi;:\nSlpecie ... . . .. . .. . ...... 1,706 48\ne Currency --------- ---- - 2,2 1\n3.9;7 48\nDue from banks and bankers... 17,579 28\n21.546 76\nExchange for clearing house. _ I12 50o\n- 21.649 26\nO U.

June 23.--The platform on\nwhich Taft and Sherman were nomi\nnated is in part as follows:\nThe Republican party, assembled by its\nrepresentatives in tife national conven\ntion, declares its unchanging faith in gov\nernment of the people, uy the people, for\nthe people. \\We renew our allegiance to\nthe principles of the Republican party\nand our devotion to the cause of Repub\nlIcan Institutions establls:ed by the fa\nthers.\nThe Republican party looks hack upon\nits record with pride and satisfhition and\nforward to its new responsibilities with\nhope and confidence.\nThe Republican party reafilrms its in\ntention to uphold at all times the authori\nty and Integrity of the courts, both state\nand federal, and it will ever Insist that\ntheir power to enforce their process and\nto ptriect life, liberty atnd property shall\nbe preserved inviolate.\nUpholds Authority of Courts.\nT\'hat the courts, hoth federal and state,\nmay hear the heavy burden laid upon\nthem to the complete satisfaction of pub\nlie opinion we favor legislation to prevent\nlong delays and the tedious and costly\nappeals which have so often amounted to\na derial of justice In civil cases and to a\nfailure to protect the public at large In\ncriminal cases.\nSince the responsibility of the judiciary\nis so great the standards of judicial ac\ntion must be always and everywhere\nabove suspicion and reproach. While we\nregard the recall of judges as unneces\nsary aud unwise, we favor such action\nas may be necessary to simplify this pro\ncess by which any judge who may he\nfound to he derolict in his duty may be\nremoved from otilen.\nTogether with peaceful and orderly de\nvelopment at home the Republican party\nearnestly favors till measures for the es\ntnblishment and protection of the peace\nof the world and the development of\ncloser relations between the various na\ntions of the earth\nThe Repuil!can party is opposed to spe\nlal privilege alnd to monuopoly. It placed\nupon the statute 1hnok the nterstate comrn\nmerce act of lR87 and the important\nIamendments thereto and the anti-trust\nact of 1tn00, and it has consistently and\nsuccessfully enforced the provisions of\nthese laws It will take no backward\nstep to permit the re-establishment ill\nany degree of conditions which were in\ntolerable.\nFor Stronger Anti-trust Law.\nThe party favors the enactment of\nlegislation supplementary to the existing\nanti-trust act which wl define as crimi\nnal offenses those specific acts that uni\nformly mark attempts to restrain and\nmonopolize to the end that all who obey\nthe law may have a guide for their ac\ntion and that those who aim to violate\nthe law may the more surely be punished.\nThe same certainty should be given to\nthe law prohibiting combinations and\nmonopolies that characterize other pro\nvisions of commercial law, in order that\nno part of the field of business may be\nrestricted by monopoly or combination;\nthat business success honorably achiev\ned may not be converted into crime and\nthat the right of every man to acquire\ncommodities and particularly the neces\nsaries of life in an open market uninflu\nenced by the manipulation of trust or\ncombination may be preserved.\nIn the enforcement and administration\nof federal laws governing interstate com\nmerce and enterprises impressed with a\npubllu use engaged therein there is much\nthat may \'e c.mmitted to a federal trade\ncommission, thus placing in the hands of\nas administrative board many of the\nfhtun.on a now by necestlty exercised by\nthe courts. This will promote promptness\nin the admhislsration of the. law and\navoid delays and technicalities incident to\ncourt procedure.\nThe Tariff Problem.\nWe reaffirm our belief In a protective\ntariff. The Republican tariff policy has\nbeen of the greatest benefit to the coun\ntry, developing our resources. diversify\nIng our industries and protecting our\nworkmen against competition with cheap\ner labor abroad, thus establishing for our\nwage earners the American standard of\nliving. The protective tariff is so woven\nInto the fabric of our agricultural life\nthat to have a tariff that would destroy\nmany Industries would throw millions of\nour people out of employment. The prod\nSucts of the farm and of the mine should\nreceive the same measure of protection.\nWe hold that the import duties should\nhe high enough, while yielding a suffilient\nrevenue, to protect adequately American\nIndustries and wages.\nRome of the existing import dulties are\ntoo high and should he reduled Read\nlustment should be made from time to\ntime to conform to changing conditions\nand to reduce excessive rates, but with\nout inijury to any American Industry. To\naccomplish this correct information is in\nIdispens.able. This informati.on can best\nbe olbained by an expert commission, as\nthe large volume of useful facts contained\nin the recent reports of the tariff board\nhas demonstrated\nWe condemn the Democratic tariff bills\npassed by the house of representatives of\nthe Sixty-se oand congress ;Is sectional, as\ninjurious to the public credit and as de\nstructive to business enterprise The\nsteady increase in the cost of living has\nbecome a matter not only of national but\nof worldwide concern. The fact that it is\nnot due to the protective tariff system is\nevidenced by the existence of similar con\nditions in countries which have a tariff\npolicy different from our own, as well as\nby the fact that the cost of living has\nincreased while rates of duty have re\nmained stationary or been reduced.\nFor Safe Banking Methods.\nThe Republican party has always stood\nfor a sound currency and for safe bank\ning methods, It is responsible for the re\nsumption of specie payments and for the\nestablishment of the gold standard. It is\ncommitted to the progressive develop\nment of our banking and currency sys\ntem. Our Ianllnig arrangements today\nneed further revision to meet the require\nments of current conditions. We need\nmeasures which, will prevent the recur\nrence of money panics and financial dis\nturbances and which will promote the\nprosperity of this country by producing\nconstant employment.\nIt is of great importance to the social\nand economic welfare of this country that\nits farmers have facilities for borrowing\neasily and using the money. It is im\nportant that financial machinery lie pro\nvided to supply the demand of farmers\nfor credit. Therefore we recommend and\nurge an authoritative investigation of\nagricultural credit societies and corpora\ntions in other countries and the passage\nof state and federal laws for the estab\nlishment and capable supervision of or\nganizations having for their purpose the\nloaning of funds to farmers.\nThe party stands committed to the main\ntenance, extension and enforcement of the\ncivil service law, and it favors the pas\nsage of legislation empowering the presl\ndent to extend the competitive service as\nfar as practicable. We favor legislation\nto make possible the equitable retirement\nof disabled and superannuated members\nof the civil service In order that a higher\nstandard of efficiency may be maintained.\nWe favor the amendment of the federal\nemployees\' Ilibtilty law so as to extend\nits provisions to all government employees\nas well as to provide a more liberal scale\nof compensation for injury and death.\nFor Clean Campaigns.\nWe favor such additional legislation as\nmay be needed more effectually to pro\nhlblit corporations from contributing\nfunds, directly or indirectly, to campaigns\nfor the nominalion or election of the pres\nIdent, the vice president, senators and\nrepresentatives in congress.\nIn the interest of the general public, and\nparticularly of the agricultural or rural\ncommunities, we favor legislation looking\nto the establishment, under proper regu\nlations. of a parcels post, the postal rates\nto be graduated under a zone system in\nproportion to the length of carriage.\nWe approve the action taken by the\npresident and congress to secure with\nRussia, as with other countries, a treaty\nthat will recognize the absolute right of\nexpatriation and that will prevent all dis\ncrimination of whatever kind between\nAmerican citizens, whether native born\nor alien and regardless of race, religion or\niprevious political allegiance.\nThe Mississippi river is the nation\'s\ndrainage ditch. Its flood waters, gather\ned from thirtv-ono states and the Do\nminion of (\'anada, constitute an overpow\nering force which breaks the levees and\npours its torrents over many million\nacres ft the richest thnd in the Unlton\nstopping mails, Impeding commerce and\ncausing great loss of life and property.\nThese floos are national in scope, and\nthe disasters they produce seriously affect\nthe general welfare. The states unaided\ncannot cope with this giant Iroblem;\nhence we ihlieve the federal government\nshould assume a fair proportion of the\nburden of its control co as to prevent dis\nasters from recurring floods.\nRepublican Accomplishment.\nThe approaching completion of the Pa.\nnama canal, the establishment of a bureau\nof mines, the institution of postal savings\nbanks, the increased provision made in\n1912 for the aged and infirm soldiers and\nsailors of the republic and for their rwid\nows and the vigorous administration of\nthe laws relantng to pure fooi and drugs,\nall mark the successful Irogress of Re.\npublican administration and are nddition\nal evidence of its effectiveness\nWe challenge st(,eessf\'l criticism of the\nsixteen yeats of IRepublican administra\ntion under l\'resldents IlMcKinley.
