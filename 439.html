Smart technologies, big data, and improvements\nin crop genetics present producers with promising new opportunities for meeting\nthese needs. However, a changing climate and an expanding global population impose\nchallenges to increasing crop and livestock production while sustaining the\nnatural resource base and protecting environmental quality. Sustainable agricultural\ndevelopment will call for systems approaches to allocate land among compet-\ning uses, coupled with the adoption of conservation technologies incentivized by\ncost-effective policies that have been based on evidence from sound economic, behavioral,\nbiological, and technological research. This paper suggests directions for\nfuture research in nine key dimensions that can fill important gaps in the existing\nliterature and build on new research methods and policy needs, as well as inform\nstrategies for sustainable growth of agriculture.\nKey words: Agro-environmental policy, systems approach, agricultural\ntechnology adoption, ecosystem services, sustainable agriculture.\nJEL codes: Q15, Q16, Q20, Q51, Q56, Q57.\nVC The Author(s) 2018.

At the same time, preferences of high-income consumers\nare shifting toward environmentally-friendly, organically-, locally-, and\nnaturally-produced foods and preservation of the diverse ecosystem services\nprovided by land and water (including aesthetic services, habitats, bio-\ndiversity, carbon storage, and recreation); these require land uses that\nincreasingly compete with agriculture.\nAfter World War II, increases in agricultural productivity in the United\nStates were largely driven by intensifying input use, including fuel, fertilizer,\npesticides, tillage, and irrigation, along with improved genetic and me-\nchanical technologies (Parton et al. 2015). Globally, the green revolution\ndoubled the production of cereal grains between 1960 and 1995 and helped\nmeet the demands of a growing population. Unfortunately, this expansion\nin agricultural output was accompanied by a suite of environmental problems\ncaused by the increased use of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and ir-\nrigation, and large-scale conversion of grasslands and forests to cropland.\nRelying on similar approaches to double food production by 2050 would require\nmore than doubling fertilizer, irrigation, and pesticide use, but rela-\ntively smaller expansion of cropland than in the past due to improved crop\nyields (Tilman and Clark 2015).\nIn the United States, high levels of chemical input use and increased livestock\nproduction have contributed to nutrient pollution and led to episodes\nof hypoxia or eutrophication in the Gulf of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, and\nthe Pacific Coast (Rabotyagov et al. 2014a). Nonpoint sources, largely agricultural,\nhave been estimated to contribute over 90% of the nitrogen in two-\nthirds of all nitrogen-impaired watersheds in the United States (Ribaudo,\nHoran, and Smith 1999). Intensified agriculture has also contributed to climate\nchange. Prior to 1930, plowing native grasslands was a large source of\nGHG emissions from agriculture. Since then, agricultural GHG contributions\nhave continued to grow, chiefly from livestock production, direct en-\nergy use, and emissions of nitrous oxide from soil (Parton et al. 2015).\nAccording to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), more-intensive\nagriculture has also led to the spread of pests, crop and livestock diseases,\ninvasive species and a loss of natural habitats for species and biodiversity.\nIntensive agricultural production has also been induced by government intervention\nin the sector through various commodity programs, and by re-\nnewable fuel policies in other sectors motivated by concerns about energy\nsecurity (Donner and Kucharik 2008; O’Donaghue and Whitaker 2010).\nAgricultural production systems are heterogeneous, multi-dimensional,\nand inter-dependent. The incentives, costs, and environmental consequences\nof switching to sustainable practices are likely to be site-specific, farmer-specific,\nand practice-specific, and large-scale adoption of such practices can be\nexpected to affect land rents and the costs of food and biofuel production.\nConsumption and production decisions in the agricultural sector are affected\nby technologies and renewable fuel policy interventions in other sec-\ntors, such as the electricity and transportation sectors. The complexity of\nsustainable management of agricultural systems is compounded by the\nSustaining our Natural Resources\n39\n', 'varied ecosystem services and disservices involved (such as soil carbon sequestration,\ndegradation of water quality, depletion of water sources, main-\ntenance of biodiversity, and provision of open spaces). Since some\nmanagement practices will improve one environmental service while worsening\nanother, farmers and policymakers must weigh the trade-offs and\nsynergies associated with resulting environmental outcomes. Sustainable\nagricultural management can be described as a wicked problem (see Batie\n2008, for a detailed description of this term) because the causes and effects\nof the problem are dynamically complex, ill-structured, and influenced by\nmany social and political factors, feedbacks, and non-linear biophysical\nresponses (Zilberman 2014; DeFries and Nagendra 2017). The potential for\nmyriad behavioral responses to the risks and uncertainties associated with\nchanging practices from the status quo adds to the complexity of addressing\nsuch problems.\nStrategies for sustainably meeting the diverse demands on agriculture—\nfor food, feed, bioenergy, and environmental quality—are ultimately about\nhow to use land and how to incorporate the market and nonmarket costs\nand benefits in shaping land allocation decisions. This has led to interest in\nstrategies for “sustainable intensification”, increasing agricultural productivity\nwhile reducing its environmental footprint (Tilman et al. 2011). Both\ntechnological and institutional innovations are essential to intensify sustainably\nwhile addressing and adapting to climate change. Innovations are in-\nduced by economic and policy considerations. Research on improved\nagricultural practices should consider the role of incentives and policies to\nfoster innovation and implementation strategies that will lead to sustainable\noutcomes (Khanna and Zilberman 1997; Zilberman, Khanna, and Lipper\n1997, and Zilberman et al. 2012) discuss various conservation technologies\nthat can increase productivity by increasing input-use efficiency and reduce\npollution generation and the barriers to their adoption. The emergence of\nnew precision technologies, remote sensing, satellite imagery and high spatial\nresolution “big data” from farms has further potential to transform the\nway that agricultural production is managed by enabling site-specific crop\nand livestock management decisions. Although these technologies appear to\npromise “win-win” outcomes for agriculture and the environment because\nthey potentially increase farm profitability and improve environmental outcomes,\ntheir costs and environmental benefits are expected to be site-specific\nand adoption rates are often low due to hidden costs, missing institutions,\nand behavioral factors.\nOther approaches, including land-sharing approaches that promote lowinput,\nlow-yield agriculture that produce both food and ecosystem services\nin the same parts of the landscape have also been suggested. With lower\nyields, such approaches would require large areas to be farmed to achieve\ngiven demands. Land-sparing approaches, on the other hand, promote practices\nthat increase yields on farmed lands while freeing up land for provid-\ning ecosystem services elsewhere (Balmford, Green, and Phalan 2015). The\nmerits of pursuing these diverse approaches and how they vary across a heterogeneous\nlandscape need to be examined by taking biophysical, eco-\nnomic, and behavioral considerations into account.\nSustainable agricultural management will involve managing land in ways\nthat are fully informed about their environmental costs and benefits\n(Robertson and Swinton 2005). This requires an understanding of the\neconomic costs and environmental effectiveness of alternative uses of land\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n40\n', 'and crop and cropping allocation practices, the synergies and trade-offs associated\nwith the economic, ecosystem services, and social dimensions of\nsustainability, and the market signals, policies, and behavioral factors that\nmotivate producers to adopt conservation technologies. By determining the\nnonmarket values placed on various services, economic research plays a key\nrole in analyzing optimal strategies for providing ecosystem services affected\nby agricultural production that typically do not have markets.\nAdditionally, since changing environmental outcomes is fundamentally\nabout changing human behavior, economic research can provide insights\nabout the economic and non-economic factors that affect consumption and\nproduction decisions and inform the design of market-based incentives for\nagricultural producers to supply ecosystem services. Such research can also\nevaluate the cost-effectiveness of policies and programs, along with their potential\nto lead to sustainable use of natural resources.\nEnvironmental economics, a field that did not exist a half century ago, has\nprovided the fundamental knowledge needed for estimating the nonmarket\nbenefits of ecosystem services. For example, economists have developed\nframeworks for designing policies that can internalize the various externalities\ngenerated by agricultural production—typically from non-point\nsources—and have provided insight into incentives for and barriers to the\nadoption of conservation technologies (Khanna, Isik, and Zilberman 2002).\nEconomists have a long history of studying land use and its economic and\nenvironmental consequences using data-driven and computational modeling\napproaches (Plantinga 2015). Economic research has shown that “getting\nprices right” is the most efficient way to internalize externalities, but such\napproaches are difficult to implement due to the non-point nature of pollution\nfrom agriculture. This has led to research on the effectiveness of second-\nbest approaches to protecting water quality (Larson, Helfand, and House\n1996; Khanna, Isik, and Zilberman 2002). More recent research is providing\nevidence of bounded rationality that prevents individuals from making economically\nrational production and consumption choices in response to price\nsignals due to search costs, inattention, lack of self-control, and other behavioral\nfactors (Shogren and Taylor 2008) Studies incorporating methods from\nbehavioral economics are showing the role that nudges such as the framing\nof scientific information (Li et al. 2014), defaults (Zarghamee 2017), social\ncomparisons (Ferraro and Price 2013), and provision of public information\n(Messer et al. 2017) can play in motivating environmentally friendly\nbehavior.\nRising to the challenge posed by sustainable agricultural development\ncalls for environmental, resource, and agricultural economists to engage in\nsystems approaches that can identify optimal strategies for managing land\nand water resources, and to design incentive mechanisms that encourage the\nadoption of those strategies in a market-driven economy; economic modeling\nis at the heart of these approaches. Key to designing incentives are behav-\nioral insights that lead to cost-effective programs and policies to help achieve\nthese broad societal and environmental priorities. These systems approaches\nshould provide forward-looking perspectives and consider the potential for\nadaptive management and decision making under uncertainty in designing\npractices and policy tools. Modeling approaches that include the dynamic\neffects of agricultural management decisions on stock externalities and the\nfeedback effects of environmental outcomes on those decisions can provide\nSustaining our Natural Resources\n41\n', 'useful insights for developing effective incentives to address environmental\nexternalities.\nAlthough the challenge of sustaining natural resources while continuing\nto increase agricultural productivity is global in nature, most of the strategies\nto meet that challenge depend upon local institutional, political, bio-\nphysical, and economic settings. Yet world markets are interconnected and\nsupply chains transmit the effects of agro-environmental problems and policies\nacross national boundaries. Consequently, systems approaches are\nneeded not only at local scales, but also at the global scale.\nOne important manifestation of supply chain effects is the response to\nemerging demand for sustainably-produced agricultural products by high\nincome, healthy, and environmentally-sensitive consumers. Downstream\nfood and agri-businesses have responded with environmental standards\nand stewardship certification programs to induce upstream farmers to\nadopt sustainable production practices—practices that underpin “green”\nproduct labels. This development highlights the need for systems\napproaches that capture the derived market demand for health and environmental\nattributes in food products.\nIn order to drill deeper into relevant research needs in these areas, we provide\na stylized characterization of the existing literature that is shown in\nfigure 1. The two parts of the figure illustrate our perspective on the state of\nsystems-oriented research into the provision of ecosystem services and on\nthe design of policies and incentives that influence the market behavior of\nconsumers and producers. The triangles in the figure point from areas that\nhave been the subject of numerous studies to areas that have been the subject\nof few studies. This characterization demonstrates areas to which new\nmethodologies and resources such as remote sensing, big data, and randomized\ncontrolled trials can be most usefully applied.\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. The next section discusses\nsystems approaches to market goods and ecosystem service provision. This\nis followed by a discussion of the importance of incentives being provided\nthrough markets and policies. In both of these sections we identify key gaps\nin research and emerging needs for studies to support the development of\nstrategies to meet the extensive challenges facing the agricultural industry.\nThe last section offers conclusions.\nSystems Approaches to Market Goods and Ecosystem Service\nProvision\nSince the ecosystem-service paradigm is only twenty years old and research\ninto agricultural ecosystems is younger still (Swinton et al. 2007),\nmuch remains to be learned from systems-level research. Approaches\ndesigned for sustainable stewardship of our natural resources will require\nlarge-scale changes in how agricultural production is managed with the potential\nfor repercussions for commodity markets, food and fuel consumers,\nproducers and landowners, and environmental services. The systems view\nencompasses the multiple products produced by agriculture, crops, livestock,\nbiofuels, and ecosystem services and takes an integrated view across\nmultiple sectors. Such a view also involves going beyond the farm-gate to\nexamine sustainable choices throughout the vertical supply chain of a product.\nA systems approach that integrates the underlying biophysical,\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n42\n', 'biogeochemical, hydrological, and biological processes with economic analysis\nis needed to understand the effects of such strategies across the produc-\ntion system and on ecosystem services. Such an approach should also\nincorporate economic and environmental feedbacks in determining the optimal\nallocation of land to meet diverse economic and environmental\ndemands. Agricultural and environmental economics provides the conceptual\nframeworks and computational modeling tools needed to integrate bio-\nphysical concepts with economic decision-making to develop sustainability\nstrategies (Zilberman et al. 2018).\nApplying systems approaches to the provision of ecosystem services should\nmove in four directions (see figure 1): (a) analyzing the provision of a multiplicity\nof jointly-generated ecosystem services; (b) allocating land and water\nresources across multiple differentiated goods, including food, feed, livestock\nproducts, and biofuels; (c) considering the scale of provision of ecosys-\ntem services—especially the intermediate scale, and (d) analyzing ecosystem\nstability and resilience to changes in human activities. To introduce these\nFigure 1 Relative research attention across ten dimensions of agro-environmental economics\nSustaining our Natural Resources\n43\n', 'topics, we highlight gaps in existing work and identify research questions\ndeserving attention.\nMultiplicity of Ecosystem Services\nMost studies of the environmental impacts of agricultural production\nhave focused on a single impact and considered approaches for mitigating\nthat impact in isolation. For instance, published studies have typically analyzed\nthe effects of food or fuel production on a single environmental exter-\nnality, such as water quality (Rabotyagov et al. 2014b); sediment run-off\n(Khanna et al. 2003), soil carbon sequestration and GHG emissions (Chen\net al. 2014; Hudiburg et al. 2016). However, changes in agricultural production\nrarely if ever affect only one ecosystem service. Multiple environmental\nservices are affected, and the outcomes can be synergistic (e.g., a reduction\nin fertilizer use could reduce the amount of nutrient run-off and carbon\nemissions) or antagonistic (e.g., using corn for ethanol could reduce carbon\nemissions relative to gasoline but create an incentive for farmers to plant\nmore corn, resulting in excess nutrients that pollute water quality). Little\ncurrent literature examines how mitigating one environmental problem\naffects other ones, such as how reducing carbon emissions affects water\nquality and/or wildlife habitat (Reeling and Gramig 2012; Housh et al.\n2015). A more holistic approach is needed to consider multi-directional\ninteractions among ecosystem services that are non-separable and are simultaneously\nimpacted by production decisions. Important research questions\ninclude the following: How can strategies for sustainable resource use be\ndesigned that consider multiple ecosystem effects, some synergistic and\nothers competing? What are the unintended consequences of ignoring ancillary\nimpacts on other ecosystem services? What is the societal willingness to\nmake trade-offs among various ecosystem services and its implications for\nland use choices?\nIntegrated Approaches to Allocation of Land and Water across Multiple Uses\nCentral to future research from a systems perspective is multi-disciplinary\ninformation to characterize the biophysical relationships among alternative\nland uses, agricultural production, and associated ecosystem services.\nAgricultural and environmental economists have developed stylized conceptual\nframeworks that incorporate sustainability considerations into eco-\nnomic optimization models to study the behavior of rational producers and\nconsumers in making choices of technology and land use (Zilberman 2014).\nThe production literature has typically assumed homogeneous producers\noperating under resource constraints with constant or decreasing returns to\nscale and stylized production and pollution functions.\nLinking agro-environmental economic models with ecological models can\nlead to production and pollution-generation functions that are more\nspatially-explicit and better-informed biophysically. By combining these\nmodels with recently developed remote sensors that can provide high resolution\ndata on land use and soil types, high-frequency climate data, geo-\ngraphic information system (GIS), and advanced computational techniques,\nenvironmental economists can potentially study the effects of spatial and\ntemporal heterogeneity in physical conditions on optimal spatial patterns of\nland-use, management of invasive species, water use, and habitat\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n44\n', 'preservation. The availability of big data and advanced information and\ncomputational technologies that enable cloud-based data storage, analytics,\nand telecommunication can be used to improve knowledge of the processes\nand relationships embedded in biophysical process models that link management\ndecisions with environmental outcomes. The social acceptability of\nlarge-scale changes in land and water uses will depend on their implications\nfor agricultural production, food and fuel prices, and income distribution\nfor consumers, producer groups, and different income groups; integrated\nsystems approaches can be used to evaluate the effectiveness and welfare\neffects of alternative strategies for sustainability. Systems approaches combined\nwith life-cycle analysis of environmental impacts can also be used to\nassess the sustainability of the entire supply chain of food, livestock, and\nfuel production from the “farm to the fork” or the “farm to the wheel”.\nExisting studies that have coupled economic and ecological modeling\nhave typically assumed that rational decision-makers were making static\ndecisions, a situation that has little in common with actual land use choices.\nDynamic optimization models and behavioral economic models can allow\nresearchers to incorporate insights about less than optimal behavior from\nbehavioral economic studies, and thus more accurately assess the barriers,\ncosts, and benefits of alternative strategies for managing land uses. These\napproaches can enable forward-looking analysis that considers adaptive\nmanagement, decision-making under uncertainty, price and policy expectations\nin designing cost-effective incentives for sustainable production\npractices.\nRelatively little research has been done on optimal allocations of land to\nmeet demands for food, feed, livestock, and fuel simultaneously, and the\neffects of those allocations on market prices, supplies, and nonmarket environmental\nservices. Several questions emerge: To what extent can low-yield,\nlocal, organic, and genetically-unmodified production meet these needs in\nthe future? How sustainable are these production processes? What is the optimal\nmix of land sharing, land sparing and sustainable intensification\napproaches to land management, and how does this vary spatially? What is\nthe most sustainable mix of food crops and fuel feedstocks? Should marginal\nland be used for food crops, livestock production, or bioenergy crop\nproduction?\nRegional and Landscape-scale Analysis of Ecosystem Service Provision\nThe two broad categories of ecosystem services that support agriculture—\nbiogeochemical and biodiversity-mediated services—vary in the spatial\nscales at which they occur. Biogeochemical services are associated with providing\nirrigation and nutrients to agricultural crops; water flowing from\nfields and pastures carries fertilizers and other nutrients that affect water\nquality and GHG emissions. Biodiversity-mediated services include the supporting\nservices of pollination and natural biocontrol of agricultural pests,\nas well as the cultural services of plant and animal appreciation (e.g., bird\nwatching, songbirds, hunting, and fishing). For both categories of services,\neffective economic valuation and incentive design for their provision calls\nfor better collaboration with biophysical scientists on understanding and\nmodeling systems.\nCompared with the ecological modeling of biodiversity-mediated services,\nthe modeling of biogeochemical services is both more advanced and\nSustaining our Natural Resources\n45\n', 'more closely-coupled with economic analysis (Hudiburg et al. 2016). A variety\nof agricultural biophysical models have been developed to simulate\nplant uptake of water, sunlight, and nutrients and their transformation into\ncrop biomass, nutrient losses, and soil erosion. Outputs from these models\nhave been linked to hydrological fate-and-transport models and global climate\ncirculation models in integrated assessment models used for economic\nanalyses to infer implied economic values and draw policy insights for climate,\nwater quality, and soil conservation (Housh et al. 2015; Garnache\net al. 2016). New, “big data” applications are beginning to link online biogeochemical\nmodels to GIS databases, thus enabling site-specific scenario\nanalysis from smart phones. For example, the 2017 Great Lakes Watershed\nManagement System enables farmers in four watersheds to input GIS coordinates\nfor their fields and then run tillage and fertilizer management sce-\nnarios to view predicted estimates of nutrient loading and soil erosion to\nnearby water bodies.1 Such innovations in biogeochemical modeling bring\nenvironmental forecasting capability to precision agriculture, inviting economic\nresearch into how to best use such information.\nThe state of ecological modeling of biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services\nis much more rudimentary. The literature has documented the links be-\ntween landscape structure and provision of natural biocontrol and\npollination services (Gardiner et al. 2009), and has begun to explore functional\nforms for projecting these services across space from habitat areas to\nbeneficiary plant populations for pollinators (Lonsdorf et al. 2009) and natural\npest control (Zhang, van der Werf, and Swinton 2010). However, to date\nthere are no well-parameterized and well-validated models of service projection\nfrom different beneficial species across different landscapes. This\nmay explain why economists have so far made few contributions. Yet rich\nopportunities exist, not least of which is to economically test the\n“intermediate landscape hypothesis,” which states that the value of\nbiodiversity-mediated ecosystem services is greatest in landscapes where\nhabitat for beneficial species is neither very rare nor abundant (Tscharntke\net al. 2012).\nThe economic motivation for research at the subregional or landscape\nscale arises from gaps in the literature on how that landscape is managed.\nAt one spatial extreme, the farm field, the value of ecosystem services associated\nwith soil fertility and structure tends to be captured privately by the\nlandowner, so there is little difference between economic values at the private\nand social levels. Hence, nonmarket valuations matter only when infor-\nmation failures occur. At the opposite spatial extreme is the global climate,\nwhich is spatially vast, and consequently is a pure public good. The\nregulation of climate services is influenced by emissions of long-lived GHGs\nemitted around the world. The biophysical modeling of these services and\ntheir linking with economic analysis is becoming quite advanced (Plantinga\n2015).\nIn between those spatial extremes lies the subregional or landscape scale.\nAt this scale, positive and negative economic externalities ensue from individual\nfarmer decisions, and internalizing those externalities often requires\ncollective effort (Stallman 2011). Yet the economics of collective provision of\necosystem services at regional and subregional scales has received little\n1Great Lakes Water Management System (http://www.iwr.msu.edu/glwms/), Institute of Water\nResources, Michigan State University. Accessed Sept. 29, 2017.\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n46\n', 'study other than in laboratory settings (Fooks et al. 2016). A similar lacuna\nexists in the economic valuation of ecosystem services at subregional and\nlandscape scales. The gap is most pronounced for biodiversity-mediated\nservices such as crop pollination and natural biocontrol of agricultural pests.\nFor these ecosystem services, both supply and demand vary spatially. The\nsupply of these services varies with both the mix of species providing them\nand the configuration of habitat in the landscape. Meanwhile, the agricultural\ndemand for them varies with crop density and the value of yield gains\nthese services can provide (Lonsdorf et al. 2009; Tscharntke et al. 2012).\nSomewhat less deficient is the state of research on the regional availability\nof water-based ecosystem services. Considerable research has been done on\nthe consumer demand side, particularly on how changes in agricultural water\nquality affect consumer demand for drinking water, swimming access,\nand fishing experiences. A major wave of research on valuing water quality\noccurred in the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in National Academies of\nSciences synthesis (National Research Council 2004). As a result, there is a\nlarge amount of data now available in benefit-transfer databases such as the\nEnvironmental Valuation Reference Inventory and the Ecosystem Valuation\nToolkit.\nThe considerable gaps in knowledge of ecosystem services and how they\ncan be managed at the subregional or landscape scale leads to the following\nset of potentially valuable research questions: What vegetative cover and\nspatial configuration conditions must be met to support viable local populations\nof pollinators, song birds, and natural enemies of crop pests? How\ndoes the economic value of those services change from one landscape setting\nto another? What kinds of incentives induce voluntary cooperation among\nland managers in supporting those services, given that their efficient provision\nrequires coordinated action at a landscape level?\nEcosystem Thresholds\nAs living systems, ecosystems are inherently dynamic and subject to\nchanges that vary over time. These changes can be irreversible and can lead\nto tipping points if they cross unobserved thresholds. Understanding the nature\nof their dynamics is a precondition to management, which necessarily\nmust be adaptive (see Chavas, Grainer, and Hudson 2016). Understanding\nvulnerability and resilience of ecosystems in response to management\nactions is critical because resilience is fundamental to sustainability (Brand\n2009). Increasing the resilience of natural systems and avoiding tipping\npoints are becoming central ecological concerns in the face of uncertainty\nabout how human activities stress ecosystems (Collins et al. 2011), and require\npolicy design that takes these possibilities into account (Lemoine and\nTraeger 2014). Many systems are subject to threshold effects beyond which\nthe initial state is irretrievable or retrievable only with difficulty and/or at\nhigh cost. Examples include lakes switching from oligotrophic to eutrophic\nstates, soils becoming saline, aquifers of fossilized water being drained or irrevocably\ncontaminated (Li et al. 2014), and endangered species being lost.\nWhile much has been done to measure the economic value of marginal\nchanges in ecosystem services, these tipping point cases raise the bigger issue\nof measuring non-marginal shifts or even existence value. Measuring\nthe economic values of system stability and resilience is relevant to\nSustaining our Natural Resources\n47\n', 'designing strategies to prevent the likelihood of irreversible and catastrophic\nchanges.\nMost economic research to date focuses on the theoretical value of avoiding\ntipping-points that may sharply and irreversibly change the availability\nof the services (Horan et al. 2011). A recent empirical effort that focused on\nstability identified cost-minimizing nitrogen and phosphorus levels subject\nto a maximum permissible probability of exceeding a water pollution\nthreshold (Rabotyagov, Valcu-Lisman, and Kling 2016). Walker et al. (2010)\nempirically measured the economic value of stability in a dynamic sense, estimating\nthe economic value of preventing soil salinization. Empirically\nmeasuring the economic values of stability and resilience remains fertile\nground for economic research, potentially building on the expected utility\nand real options literatures. These values can be linked to systems\napproaches to develop strategies for sustainable resource use that incorporate\nprobabilistic constraints on outcomes. Safety-first rules have been tradi-\ntionally used to achieve outcomes that constrain average utility in any time\nperiod from falling below a threshold (Zilberman 2014). Instead of setting\nthese thresholds arbitrarily, they could be determined by the value attached\nto various threshold levels.\nKey questions in this area include the following: What conditions trigger\nsharp shifts in the state of an ecosystem that are irreversible or reversible\nonly at high cost? How likely are such changes under plausible scenarios?\nWhat is the value of averting such changes? How much caution is enough?\nWhat types of policies could reasonably limit the risk of irreversible damage?\nHow can the value of averting irreversible damages to ecosystems be\nincluded in systems approaches to sustainable resource use?\nIncentives through Markets and Policies\nUnderstanding the underlying system-level ecological structure and its\nfunctions is an essential precondition to designing optimally-intensified yet\nsustainable management approaches. Since we can expect that farmers’ land\nuse and production decisions will aim to maximize their own interests, it is\ncritical to design market- and policy-based incentives that align self-interest\nwith societal goals for preserving the environment. As shown in figure 1, we\nview five areas of research as key to establishing functional incentives for\nfarmers: policies that consider the management of joint environmental\nimpacts; approaches to nonmarket valuation that balance the demand for\necosystem services with supply of those services; understanding the effects\nof markets and ways to shift responsibility for incentivizing conservation\npractices from public regulation to private-sector responses; identification of\nincentive mechanisms and sustainability policies that are cost-effective and\nimplementable; and understanding the behavioral drivers behind farmers’\ntechnology-adoption decisions.\nPolicies for Managing Joint Environmental Impacts\nEfforts to address one environmental externality are likely to have repercussions\nfor other external effects either directly due to the fact that they are\njointly produced or indirectly by affecting market prices that affect resource\nuse. Some of these direct and indirect effects could be beneficial, while others\nmay be harmful. Researchers increasingly recognize the problems and\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n48\n', 'unintended consequences associated with ignoring the interconnectedness of\nvarious markets and jointness in environmental impacts. When attempting to\nregulate multiple environmental impacts, the standard expectation for an efficient\nchoice of policy instruments is that the number of performance-based\npolicy instruments should match the number of environmental objectives\n(Woodward and Kaiser 2002). However, when environmental impacts are\njointly produced, a single policy will have multiple environmental impacts.\nA few studies have examined the efficiency of compensating farmers for generating\nabatement credits for more than one pollutant simultaneously\n(Woodward 2011) and of allowing cross-pollutant trading (Montero 2001).\nOther studies have looked at the effectiveness of conservation programs that\nseek to maximize multiple environmental objectives (Fooks and Messer\n2013). Only a few studies have examined trade-offs and synergies associated\nwith efforts to improve one environmental outcome for other outcomes.\nHoush et al. (2015), Reeling and Gramig (2012), and Egbendewe-Mondzozo\net al. (2015) studied synergies and conflicts associated with reducing excess\nnutrient flows and GHG emissions, and their implications for designing the\npolicy mix to achieve targets for multiple environmental outcomes.\nMultiple policy instruments, each targeted to a specific pollution outcome,\ncan lead to redundant penalties and/or rewards. A farmer could, for example,\nreceive duplicate compensation by providing payments for each multiple\nenvironmental service from a single action on an acre of land, resulting in\ncredit stacking or “double dipping.” Identifying the “additional” credits generated\nin response to a policy incentive that would not have been provided\notherwise requires an understanding of the biophysical processes that generate\ncomplementarity and substitutability among ecosystem impacts. Another\npriority for future studies should be analyzing the positive and negative spillover\neffects of policy actions that jointly affect multiple ecosystem services.\nBy accounting for unintended consequences of improvements in one environmental\nservice that may undermine other services, the goal is to identify pol-\nicy mixes that can optimally regulate the various interconnected externalities.\nThe existence of spillover effects points to the need for a holistic approach to\npolicy design rather than piecemeal efforts that control a single pollution\nproblem in isolation. Important questions in this area include the following:\nHow should policy tools be designed to efficiently achieve multiple beneficial\noutcomes? What is the net change in economic value (private and social) that\nresults? How can cost-effectiveness and political feasibility be factored into\nmulti-dimensional agro-environmental policy designs?\nEnvironmental Valuation to Balance Demand and Supply of Ecosystem\nServices\nMuch agro-environmental policy research analyzes the cost-effectiveness\nof alternative approaches to meet an environmental quality target. These\nstudies have been valuable both for identifying theoretically efficient “firstbest”\npolicy designs (focused on environmental outputs) and for recogniz-\ning problems with transaction costs and information asymmetry that can\ncause “second-best” policy designs (focused on inputs) to be more costeffective\nin practice (Wu and Babcock 1996).\nReceiving little or no attention has been how the environmental quality\ntarget is determined. Ideally, the socially-optimal target level for pollution\ncontrol should be determined by weighing the cost to producers of\nSustaining our Natural Resources\n49\n', 'providing pollution abatement against the willingness of consumers to pay\nfor those benefits. By linking monetary values for multiple ecosystem services\nwith models of land use, input, and management choices, it is also pos-\nsible to analyze trade-offs among multiple environmental services.\nThe lion’s share of research for measuring the economic value of ecosystem\nservices from agriculture has focused on abating agricultural water pol-\nlution and GHG emissions (National Research Council 2004; National\nAcademies of Sciences 2017). Most of this work, in turn, has aimed to measure\nconsumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for better environmental condi-\ntions. On the other side of the implied market for ecosystem services, a\nsmaller number of studies has measured what it would cost farmers to\nchange practices to provide those environmental improvements. The cost of\nproviding those benefits is typically referred to farmers’ “willingness to\naccept” (WTA), in reference to the payment needed to offset that cost. In theory,\nat the socially-optimal level of environmental quality, WTP equals\nWTA. Unfortunately, the units of measure are nearly always quite different.\nMeasures of WTP typically consider the final services that consumers experience,\nsuch as recreation and water quality. Economic values are measured\nin terms of a monetary value per day or per household. By contrast, measures\nof WTA usually consider the cost of changing farm production practi-\nces in terms of the cost per unit of land (Ma et al. 2012). Largely hidden from\nanalytical scrutiny are the intermediate steps that connect conservation\nactions by farmers with the changed ecosystem services experienced by consumers,\nsuch as reductions in agricultural run-off of sediments and nutrients\n(Swinton et al. 2015). Often these intermediate steps occur across long distances\nthat separate the producers and consumers of these changes in envi-\nronmental quality. Due to spatial variation in agricultural land use and the\ndemand for ecosystem services affected by agriculture, the implied equilibrium\nvalues from balancing farmer WTA with consumer WTP are also likely\nto be spatially variable. Spatial variability in environmental value is especially\nlikely for ecosystem services mediated by water and biodiversity\n(Tscharntke et al. 2012; Keiser and Muller 2017)—the ecosystem services\nthat are manifested at the subregional and landscape scale.\nAbundant opportunities exist to link the demand and supply sides of economic\nvaluation of ecosystem services related to agriculture. Important re-\nsearch questions in this area include the following: How to link biophysical\nmodels of farming practices and immediate ecological consequences with the\necosystem services that consumers experience? How best to translate the\nend-user environmental targets (based on WTP) into optimal supply-side targets\n(based on WTA) that are measured in acres of land with specific changes\nin farming practices? How to define numéraire physical units suitable for\nequilibrium environmental economic “prices” of agroecosystem improvements?\nHow does variation in these environmental economic “prices” across\na landscape signal where improvements have greatest value?\nPublic Policies and Private-sector Standards to Incentivize\nConservation Practices\nClosely linked to the economic challenge of determining optimal levels of\nenvironmental quality is the challenge of crafting incentives for stewardship\nbehavior that reaches those levels. Incentives may come through public or\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n50\n', 'private sector channels. Most past research on incentive design has focused\non government policy, the scope of which extends to externalities and public\ngoods where traditional market solutions frequently fail. But private sector\nincentives become increasingly important as consumers pay more attention\nto the agro-food supply chain and to ethical production practices, which extend\nto environmental effects. So incentives matter in both public and pri-\nvate sectors, but the economic research opportunities differ between the two\nsectors.\nBecause rural landowners in the United States hold broad property rights\nto manage land in their own best interests, U.S. agro-environmental policy\nhas focused on paying farmers for improved stewardship. U.S. government\nagencies spend billions of dollars annually on conservation payment programs\nthat seek to provide incentives to farmers to adopt best management\npractices or offer payments for farmers who provide environmental services.\nThese programs supply impure public goods because they provide both private\nand external benefits. The expectation is that producers will respond to\nthese financial incentives and will also invest in providing environmental\nservices because of the private benefit they can receive in return. Therefore,\nthe cost-effectiveness of the programs depends on accurate assessments of\nthe amount of payment required to incentivize farmers, their willingness to\nshare in the cost of these services, and how those factors vary among farmers\nwhose preferences, finances, and growing conditions are heterogeneous\n(Duke, Dundas, and Messer 2013).\nCompared to a government program administrator offering an incentive\npayment, the producers receiving the payment offer have greater knowledge\nof how much the practice will cost them to adopt and implement, in-\ncluding the cost of lost productivity and how this practice will fit into their\nother farm management decisions. This information asymmetry can lead to\nwindfall gains (informational rents) for some producers who participate in\nthese programs as the payments can be well in excess of what would actually\nbe necessary to induce the desired behavioral change. Kirwan,\nLubowski, and Roberts (2005), for example, estimated that informational\nrents to farmers comprised roughly 30% to 40% of annual payments made\nby the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Conservation Reserve Program\n(CRP). However, entry into these programs can be problematic, especially\nsince enrollment tends to be a tedious task due to the burdens and lengths\nof the contracts. McCann and Claassen (2016) and Palm-Forster et al. (2016)\nshowed that transaction costs associated with the CRP and other similar\nconservation programs can undermine farmers’ willingness to participate.\nWater quality markets have often struggled with low farmer participation\n(Shortle 2013) and transfer of development rights programs have generally\nfailed to live up to their initial lofty hopes (Messer 2007). Clearly, hidden\ncosts associated with information asymmetries, transaction costs, and getting\nrobust participation in programs can interfere with the cost-\neffectiveness of conservation policies. Climate change mitigation policy\nposes similar challenges from hidden costs of compliance (McCarl and\nHertel 2018).\nRelevant research questions related to public incentives include the following:\nHow cost-effective are current programs, especially the ones that\npay for practices rather than for performance? How can public incentives be\nmade more cost-effective? Is there a policy role for biophysical models to\nSustaining our Natural Resources\n51\n', 'simulate nonpoint source pollution outcomes that would be costly to measure\ndirectly?\nWhereas many public sector stewardship incentives pay farmers to\nchange behavior, private sector incentives tend to set standards that farmers\nmust meet to gain access to a specialized market. This difference means the\neconomic issues focus not on cost-effective payment for environmental services,\nbut rather on why, how, and how well private sector standards func-\ntion. Many studies have examined the conditions under which consumers\nare willing to pay a premium for foods with ecolabels, indicating that they\nare environmentally friendly (Loureiro, McCluskey, and Mittelhammer\n2002; Messer, Costanigro, and Kaiser 2017). This consumer demand has\ndriven the development of new private-sector standards that are being developed\nat both the input-oriented (e.g., 4 R’s Nutrient Stewardship) and\nretail-oriented ends of the food value chain (e.g., Field to Market’s\nFieldprintVR Calculator, Rainforest Alliance certification, Walmart’s sustainability\nefforts).\nMore than 80% of the top 50 U.S. food companies have committed to incorporating\nsustainability initiatives and have established programs to re-\nduce waste, conserve energy, increase food safety, and improve animal\nwelfare (Ross, Pandey, and Ross 2015). Many smaller agri-food firms are\nvoluntarily seeking eco-friendly certifications, adopting private standards\nfor sustainability, and producing ecolabeled foods. The number of ecolabels\nhas grown dramatically. Some labels, such as USDA Organic, have been\nestablished by government programs, but there are many nongovernmental\necolabels, such as the 4 R’s program, the Field to Market FieldprintVR\nCalculator, and Rainforest Alliance’s Certification program. Innovations in\nbig data technologies, logistics, and labeling now enable traceability of environmental\nstewardship traits along the supply chain from the farmer to the\nfinal consumer (Ahearn, Armbruster, and Young 2016).\nAdditional research is need to help determine the reasons behind this recent\nsurge in private initiatives, as well as their merits, welfare, and environ-\nmental effects (see Roe, Teisl, and Deans 2014). Relevant questions include\nthe following: Why do some firms choose to become engaged in environmental\nsustainability? Are the reasons just due to consumer demand, or are\nthese decisions due to the preferences of the firm’s management and/or\nshareholders? How effective are such initiatives at inducing farmers to\nadopt conservation practices? And ultimately, are these practices having\npositive environmental impacts on the ground? What kinds of environmental\nproblems are likely to be tackled (and ignored) by these private efforts?\nTo what extent do market-based initiatives achieve socially-efficient levels\nof protection for public goods such as water quality, biodiversity, and soil\ncarbon stocks? What are the social welfare effects of the market power acquired\nby a company that differentiates its products labeled as being grown\nwith methods that are friendly to the environment? What is the proper role\nof government in ensuring that ecolabels and similar initiatives are credible?\nBehavioral Drivers of Conservation Technology Adoption and Its Policy\nImplications\nFarmers’ adoption of conservation technologies can be regarded as an investment\ndecision determined by their net gain from adoption after consid-\nering all of the costs they incur in using the new technology. In existing\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n52\n', 'environmental economic studies, net gains generally have been measured\neither by the farmer’s profit or utility (depending on the assumptions made\nabout risk preferences). However, many other factors are almost certainly\ninvolved in farmer adoption decisions, including their degree of aversion to\nloss and ambiguity, inattention, inconsistent time preferences, search and\ntransaction costs, and the influence of social networks, norms, and peer\npressure. Behavioral models have the potential to provide significant insight\ninto the disappointingly low rate of adoption of such technologies, even\nwhen they can provide farmers with positive net gains (Foster 2010).\nAn essential question follows: Do incentives/nudges lead to sustained\nchanges in behavior? Thus far, evidence on the effectiveness of behavioral\nnudges in policy applications comes primarily from studies of short-term\noutcomes; only a handful of studies have explored their long-term impacts\nin the realm of agriculture and environmental policy (Ferraro, Miranda, and\nPrice 2011; Allcott and Rogers 2014). It will also be particularly important to\nunderstand farmers’ risk and time preferences and their attitudes toward\nambiguity when designing the payoff structure for an agro-environmental\nprogram. Studies will need to expand beyond hypothetical statedpreference\nmeasures (Loewenstein et al. 2015) to analyze actual behavior in\nagro-environmental contexts, since farmer adoption of these practices\ninvolves a large upfront cost that is recouped only gradually over time. This\n“present biasedness” has been demonstrated in studies by Suter, Poe, and\nBills (2008) and Khanna, Louviere, and Yang (2017). Key remaining questions\ninclude: Will farmers respond to these nudges once they become more\naware of the behavioral evidence that naı̈ve respondents are swayed by\nthese approaches? How and when social networks, peer pressure, social\ncomparisons, and norms influence the decision on whether to adopt conservation\npractices? What can lead to dis-adoption of conservation practices?\nPolicy Approaches that Are Both Cost-effective and Practical\nA number of agro-environmental studies have considered the best\ndesigns for policies aimed at cost-effectively addressing issues such as asymmetric\ninformation, moral hazard, uncertainty, and the nonpoint nature of\nagricultural pollution. Economic models incorporating heterogeneity among\nfarmers, in their landscape and location, and in climate conditions show\nthat optimal policy incentives need to vary across space and over time\n(Xepapadeas 2012; Xabadia, Goetz, and Zilberman 2008). Smith, Sanchirico,\nand Wilen (2009) developed a modeling framework that is being applied to\nfisheries and should be considered for other agro-environmental applications.\nAnother important issue related to spatial and temporal heterogeneity\nis environmental monitoring (see the survey by Shimshack 2014).\nWhile economic models show the efficiency of polluter pay policies, those\nimplemented in practice have provided subsidies to farmers to adopt environmentally\nfriendly practices (Khanna and Farnsworth 2006). Some conser-\nvation policies such as the CRP rely on assigning points to the multiple\nenvironmental benefits from land retirement and the various benefits of different\nvegetative covers rather than the monetary values of those benefits.\nEither way, the cost effectiveness of policies generally increases if they are\ntargeted and provide site-specific incentives (Duke, Dundas, and Messer\n2013). However, targeted policies can be difficult to implement in practice\nbecause they rely on unobservable information about farmer, farm, and\nSustaining our Natural Resources\n53\n', 'landscape characteristics. Furthermore, leaders of a number of public agroenvironmental\nprograms have reported that cost-effectiveness often is not a\npriority for the programs and the program staff lack incentives to adopt\nnew approaches to control agricultural externalities (Grand, Messer, and\nAllen 2017; Messer 2016).\nSome papers have investigated approaches for translating the complex\npolicy outcomes from integrated systems models to developing rules for\npolicy incentives that rely on observed farm, farmer, and landscape characteristics.\nYang, Khanna, and Farnsworth (2005) illustrate this approach for\ntargeting cost-effective land enrollment in a land retirement conservation\nprogram. Horan, Shortle, and Abler (2002) develop practical approaches for\ntrading pollution credits between point and non-point sources. Rabotyagov,\nValcu, and Kling (2014c) use expert opinion and biophysical models to develop\nproxies for environmental impacts of alternative agricultural practi-\nces, and analyze their cost-effectiveness relative to first-best approaches. The\npracticality of implementing targeted policy incentives could change with\nthe increasing availability of big data. By providing information about sitespecific\nfield conditions and input application decisions, such data could\nconvert nonpoint source pollution into point source pollution and make it\neasier to link environmental impacts to production decisions (Antle,\nCapalbo, and Houston 2015).\nAt the confluence of policy and behavioral economics, several research\nquestions emerge: How can the insights provided by behavioral economics,\nwhich suggest that non-price incentives may be more effective than price\nincentives in motivating a change in behavior, be incorporated in designing\npolicies? What are the outcomes of agro-environmental programs that\nadministrators care most about and what are the trade-offs this poses with\nthe goal of cost-effectiveness? How can we use systems approaches to design\npractically implementable programs and assess trade-offs with cost-\neffectiveness?\nConclusions\nThe agricultural sector faces the grand challenge of increasing the efficiency\nwith which constrained land and water resources are used to provide\nfood and fuel for a growing population with rising incomes and changing\ntastes for livestock products, as well as locally, and sustainably-produced\nagricultural products. The development of research approaches that marry\neconomics to agricultural and biological sciences is critical to providing solutions\nto address this challenge. With new developments in biological scien-\nces and genetics, the emerging bioeconomy is on the threshold of\nintegrating the agricultural, energy, transportation, and electricity sectors.\nInsightful research can help to direct the development of the bioeconomy\nalong a sustainable trajectory.\nEnvironmental economists have contributed substantially to improving\nour understanding of the economic decisions that affect the nexus between\nagriculture and the environment, the value of the ecosystem services impacted\nby agriculture, and the design of policy incentives to support a more\nsustainable agriculture. This paper identifies several directions for future research\nto build the capacity for systems approaches that consider the multi-\nple outputs produced and the multiple ecosystem services that are affected\nby agriculture. Research at the interface of agriculture and the environment\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\n54\n', 'should consider ways to more closely connect the values of ecosystem services\nto consumers (WTP) with the costs to producers of providing those\nservices (WTA) in designing sustainable targets for environmental quality.\nEmerging insights from behavioral economics can be applied to develop\nmore effective policies to induce changes in decisions that affect agriculture.\nFuture research also needs to explore ways to integrate the vast amounts of\nbiophysical data on soil quality, climate, land use and farmer decisions in\nthe development of strategies for sustainable intensification of land use, in\ndesigning more effective and implementable policies for reducing non-point\npollution, and in improving understanding of the drivers of farmer behavior.\nFinally, the recent explosion of non-government, market driven incen-\ntives for sustainable agricultural production call for more research on their\nunderlying motivations and effectiveness in achieving the grand challenges\nfaced by agriculture.\nReferences\nAhearn, M.C., W.
