Insert (left) President Lewis, of the United Mine Workers, and (right) Secretary of Labor Davis., Caught between the engine and ten, der while endeavoring to escape after (, the hundred-ton crane, two ears back, of the engine, having crushed a bent, and being in act of toppling from a, trestle, William S. Elliott, one of the, most reliable and popular crane engi, neers employed on the Alaska rail, road, was crushed to death Saturday, afternoon. The accident occurred at, Mile 277, while the wrecking crane, was returning from having assisted a, freight engine back on the track after, a gravel slide had derailed it., Engineer C. H. Smith, in charge of, the pilot engine and Tom Sheehan,, fireman were injured about the head,, seriously, but not dangerously., According to a report supplied the, Alaskan Engineering Commission the, accident was due to a softening of the, soil about a piling driven in swampy, ground which had been subjected to, an overplus of water, due to the ex, cessive rains of the past few weeks., The body of Mr Elliott was brought, to Anchorage Saturday afternoon and, turned over to the Williams undertak-j, ing parlors for preparing for shipment, to his former home in Seattle, and the, injured were taken to the Anchorage, hospital., According to information supplied, William Gerig, first assistant engi, neer of the commission, the train, in, cluding the big crane, was proceeding, southward after clearing the track., The engine drawing the train was in, charge of Charles H. Smith, and was, proceeding at reduced speed. At, tached to the pilot engine were two, cars, and next came the 100-ton .crane., Mr. Elliott was engineer on the crane,, and had just gone ahead and joined, Engineer Smith in the cab. taking the, fireman’s seat. Glancing hack he saw, the crane starting to topple over and, was in the act of escaping and hdd, reached a point where a sheet of steel, bridges the space between the tender, and engine when the force of the top, pling crane as it plunged eighteen, feet to the swamp, dragged the ,,two, cars and engine backward with it. Mr., Elliott was caught by the sheet of, steel which almost severed his body., Smith and Sheehan attempted to es, cape and Sheehan wras hit on the head, and rendered unconscious, but fell, clear of the wreckage. Engineer, Smith, according to information re, ceived, was cut about the head by, glass, hut jumped to safety., In addition to the pilot engine a, locomotive with steam up was at the, rear, being brought in from a previ, ous derailment, farther up the line,, in charge of "Malamute” Clark. See, ing the crane toppling on the curve of, the trestle Clark reversel his engine, and saved the remainder of the train, from following the crane, pilot engine, and cars., As the piling gave way it carried, the entire bent with it and the follow, ing collapse of the trestle carried some, eighteen bents with it, piling the, tangled mass into the swamp below., It will be necessary, according to Mr., Gerig, to dismantle the crane to extri, cate it from the swamp. Mr. Gerig, stated that it was expected to have, the lire clear and trains running, through by Thursday, Wm. S. Elliott has been employed, by the A E. C. for the past three or, four years in the machine shops and, as crane engineer and was one of the, most popular employes -in the yards,, both with his fellow workmen and the, commission., Explaining the possible \'cause of the, accident, Mr. Gerig stated that the, excessive rains of the past few weeks, has softened the entire country, and, that it was his opinion that a piling, gave way under the pressure of the, big crane and the soft swamp allowed, the other bents to be pulled along by, the rails after they were thrown out, of position. Mr. Gerig stated that the, crane had passed over the trestle sev, eral times and that no evidence of, weakness had manifested itself. In, addition to the commission crane a, heavier one belonging to the Ameri, can Bridge Company that erected the, Sus’tun and the Hurricane Gulch, bridges had passed over the trestle on, several occasions., WILLIAM SHERMAN ELLIOTT, William Shemari Elliott was born in, Newcastle, Washington, and was mar, ried to Miss Violet L. Ball at George, town, Washington. For a number of, years Mr. Elliott was in the fuel and, lumber business at Georgetown and, later was engaged in the moving pic, ture business at Georgetown and El, lensburg. Mr. Elliott came to Seward, in 1915 as an employe of the Alaskan, Engineering commission. During the, World War he was employed in the, Skinner & Eddy ship yards at Seattle,, and returned to Alaska in 1920, taking, charge of the crane work for the com, mission. with headquarters in Anchor, age. Mr. Elliott was a member of, the Georgetown Masonic and Elk, lodges, the Anchorage chapter of the, Eastern Star, and the local Consistory, club. The deceased leaves a mother,, sister and two brothers, living in Se, ttle, and a wife and daughter Violet, in, Anchoi\'age, and daughter, Happy, now, studying music in the States.

Local ser, vices will be conducted Wednesday af, ternoon at 3 o’clock under the aus, pices of the Masonic lodge at the lodge, rooms., Mr. Elliott was a young man of ex, emplary habits, a loving husband arid, devoted father.

Baker, U. S. fisher, ies Agent for the Central District of Alaska,, reports that the salmon escapement is slight, ly heavier now in the Copper River than it, y WflS at tins time last season. The Copper Riv, er Indians at Chitina have caught and dried, practically all the fish they will need, and, Indians farther up the river are making fair, catches. 3 \'* \'1 ^ ■ \' - *\'\'\', , While away, Mr. Baker took a great many, photographs of the spawning grounds ol the, lakes and tributaries of the Copper River,, and also got a number of pictures of the na, tives fishing and of their fish wheels and gear., “I went as far as the upper end of Summit, Lake, which spot is only a few miles from the, summit of the Fairbanks Mountain Range,”, said Mr. Baker this morning. “From Chitina, on I found the wonderfully beautiful Aveatlier, for Avhieh the Interior is noted; and Avhich, makes that part of the Territory so healthful, and livable. During the day, the temperature, ranged from 85 to 95 degrees. The settlers, along the trail are prosperous, but the road, houses are complaining, as the travel over this, route has almost completely disappeared. This, is due to the completion of the Government, road from Seward to Fairbanks, and the peo, ple, naturally, Avant to go the new Avay. Some, of the old-time roadhouse people are getting, discouraged and declare they intend to quit., “Tlie Fairbanks Trail is in fair condition, as far as Gulkana, but beyond that point the, road is very rough with many culverts in bad, shape. A good deal of road work is going on, and considerable monev is being spent in im, provement. Good roads for this section will, be the main attraction for the tourist travel,, and the only thing that will keep up the his-\', toric roadhouses,—the l«od marks of our earlv, pioneers. It is my opinion that tourists to this, country would .much prefer to traverse the, old trails, with their wealth of early history, and Indian lore,—if these trails are kept in, traveling condition—rather than to go on the, modern railroad, which is- delightfully com, fortable. but which lacks the charm of the, great out-of-doors method of travel., “While on this trip. I noticed particularly, the soils along the trail. In most places there, is a rich volcanic ash. which offers wonderful, possibilities for farming. In my opinion, the, time is not far distant when Alaska will raise, its own garden truck. The fishing and min, ing industries have heretofore offered such, opportunites for speedy returns that Alaskans, have naturally spent their energies in those, directions., “Fur farming, especially fox farming, will, become more stabilized and dependable as a, source of certain profit, and, incidentally,, there is not a better country in the world for, such operations than along the Fairbanks trail., That region is dry and cold in winter with, rabbits and other natural food as a side fea, ture. Already flourishing fox farms are to be, found, one of the best in the district being that, of George Bull, only nine miles from Chitima., He has jiow thirtv-two splendid specimens of, silver gray fox. His farm is well organized j, and he is carrying forward the work in a high, ly specialized\', and, I should say, successful, manner. The time may come when Alaska will, be as noted for its fox and fur farming as it, now is for its fisheries., “The Interior of Alaska is truly the sports, men’s paradise. The country abounds in big, game,—mountain sheep, goats, caribou, moose,, black, grizzly and brown bears; birds are ev, erywhere,—ptarmigan, spruce hens, and many, other game birds,—and there are enough var, ieties of fine game fishes to delight the heart, of the most devoted angler., “Lakes,—everywhere one looks are lakes in, the great Copper River Valley. We have a Val, ley of Ten Thousand Smokes a little to the, west of us, in the Ivatmai region. Why not, sing the praises of the wonderland close at, hand,—the Valley of Ten Thousand Lakes?”, MINING OUTLOOK PRESAGES BOOM, Trend of events within the past week pre, sent a bright outlook for Anchorage and envi, rons. Among the most important auguries is, the presence in the city of a representative of, the United States Smelting and Refining com, pany who is known to be seeking large depos, its of copper ores, and his statement that, smelting in this vicinity is altogether feasible;, that there is an abundance of good cokeing, coal in Matanuska and that with the build, ing of more roads to known ore deposits min, ing development will take on a tremendous], forward impetus., Incidents like these may be taken as a fore, runner to bigger things; it is the way the big, fellows proceed. That something along the, railroad warranting development has been j, found is known to those close to the repre, sentative of the smelting company., On top of this prospective outlook is the an, nouncement of Jerome Drumheller that Willow, creek is another Cripple creek; that the ores, are persistent, of commercial grade, and that, the Drumheller-AVoldson interests have devel, oped sufficient ore to warrant the erection of, a stamp mill and that the mill will be installed, as soon as road facilities will permit., Statements like these, coming from men of, Mr. Drumheller’s prominence and possessed, of the capital he and his associates control, augur well for any mining region. Among the, big industrial developments Messrs. Drumhel, ler and associates have accomplished is the, Drumheller coal fields of Alberta, Canada,, where thousands of men are employed ami, -where a substantial city has sprung up. Op, erating in association this capital may \\\\ ‘1I, lie bid for by any community., The Pern mine in Willow creek is not tin*, only enterprise Mr. Drumheller is interested, in and it, is known that prospects having merit, will receive his consideration. The same may, be said of L. J. Hohle, representing the U. S., Smelting and Refining company., This bright outlook in the mining field, should be a source of pleasure for Anchorage, and environs.—Anchorage Times., Voice of the Alaska Press, \' ,*&E V~\' ___ V“W\' ** *■ l I- * Mi- ■, If plans now under way are consumated, a branch of, fice of the Pathfinder, the Pioneer magazine will be es, tablished in Seward, and several issues of the publica, tion will be. printed here.

From the doorway, of No. 19 poor Dick, stricken with, blindness, groped down to the water\'s, edge for the sense of the Thames’, damp and the feel of the ships that, wafted to ids nostrils the pungent, smells of the East. Lying across that, doorway, Torpenhow first found, Bessie Broke, the little street girl, from ‘south ’o the river,’ who fell in, fove with him, and revenged herself, on Dick for his interference by scrap, ing away the face of the Melancholia., On a table of the Kipling rooms in, the Embankment chambers, Charlie, Mears, of ‘The Finest Story in the, World,’ scrawled the words, meaning, less to him, that told of the agony of, the galjey si&ve.

Toth was given a great send off, by his freinds when lie departed, from Boston., Toth declares that he will con, quer the channel or perish in the, attempt. Unbiased followers of, swimming declare that Toth has the, ability and all the physical qualities, that should go with a candidate for, this ordeal. His advent into swim, ming has been interestng and re, markable, for he was thirty-four, years old before he learned how to, swim. Toth now is forty-four years, old, and in his ten years of swim, ming has furnished much and re, markable data for the archives of, difficult sports achievements., In September, 1914, two years af, ter learning how to swim, Toth, startled the swimming world by, navigating from Charlestown Bridge, ■to Boston Light, a distance of elev, en miles, in six hours and forty, eight minutes, incidentally establish, ing a record for a hitherto untied, course., In July of the, following year,, Toth again completed the Boston, Light swim, beating twelve other, starters, among them George Meehan,, of Brookline, the winner of the fam, ous Sandy Hook swim. Not being, contented with a one-way swim to, Boston Light Toth made a return, trip in September, 1915, setting a, new American endurance mark of, fifteen hours and twenty-seven min, utes, swimming twenty-four miles in, all. 1, One week later Toth once more, startled the sports world by tread, ing his way from Charlestown Bridge, to Graves Light and thence to Re, vere Beach, swimming over twenty, five miles in twelve hours and forty, nine minutes. He was the, first man, to accomplish this feat., BEATS SEVEN STARTERS, In July of 1916 the unbeatable, Charley once more wended his way, to Boston Light, being the only, man of seven starters to finish., Refusing to be bait for. any man, eating shark, Toth left the water in, August, 1916, after swimming eigh, teen miles in fourteen hours and, twenty-three minutes in his attempt, to swim from Provincetown to Nan, tasket Beach. A six-hundred and fif, ty-pound shark was caught in Boston, Harbor on the following day., September, 10, 1916, he won the, ten-mile N. E. A. A. A. TJ. cham, pionship. Journeying to New York in, September, 1917, Toth won the, Hudson River Marathon swim, a, distance of nine and a half miles., Last summer, in a contest with, Sam Richards with the Boston • Light, as a goal, Toth was separated from, his pilots for ten minutes due to a, heavy squall which nearly capsized, the boat, but continued on, complet, ing the swim in five hours and thir, ty-seven minutes. Richards gave up, when the storm arrived. The winner, of this contest determined the man, who would represent the “L” Street, Swimmers Club in the English ■, Channel swim., Anxious to get a real test in his, preparation for the English swim,, Toth braved the icy waters of early, June, this year, going to Groves, Eight from the “L” Street Baths,, an eleven-mile swim, in four hours, two and one-half minutes. In the, outer harbor the temperature ranged, from forty-three to forty-nine de, grees, being the coldest water re, corded in any long distance swim., Two weeks ago this almost super, man towed a boat containing seven, people a distance of five miles,, the combined weight of passengesr., and boat being 1,443 pounds. Two, and one-half miles of this swim was, against an incoming tide and a dead, east wind., Det the Daily Times figure on yo .•, iob work., HOME, SWEET, HOME, Wl‘4.1, OP, COURSE m/*r, K DIF1*ERS«J, SAN'S OAD^, xsssssd, > -*-c—, TWELL AT LAST I see THAT OLD \\, ^ CRANK OF A LANOLORD HAS’ j, |v 6DHT UP A AN AN TO PAPER-//, hous-&-» ~rt/, ^ M Y WHAT Tfc£R.i8LE. \\, ^PAPER*- SAYf wmo even. /, YOLO YOU TO PUT >/, \\ -that r&RT cp papeY c’v, rj>-_^_vo«jiTvs' *, ^ )T, yVlUAT A PRETTY j, TINT IT HAS^^/, APPEARS IN FLORIDA, MILLVILLE, Fla., July 31.—Peo, ple in this section have long been in, almost nightly fear of the prowling, of sOmt animal, said to be a pan, ther, which makes nocturnal raids, on pigstys, goatherds and now is, attacking chicken roosts.
