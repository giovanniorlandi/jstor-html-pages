On the other hand, antioxidants induced by oxidative stress enhance glycolysis to maintain the acquisition of ATP\nallowing epithelial cells with damaged genomes to survive. In the repetitive phase of colitis, survival factors enable these epithelial\ncells to continuously proliferate. -e main purpose is to restore and rebuild damaged mucosa, mainly aiming to recover mucosal\ndamage and reconstruct mucosa, but it is also implicated in the occurrence and malignancy of CRC. -e metabolic reprogramming\nof aerobic glycolysis and lipid synthesis enables these transformed epithelial cells to convert raw carbohydrate and\namino acid substrates, thereby synthesizing protein and phospholipid biomass. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase, responsible for the fatty\nacid desaturation, improves the fluidity and permeability of cell membranes, which is one of the key factors affecting metabolic\nrate. In response to available fat, tumor cells reprogram their metabolism to better plunder energy-rich lipids and rapidly scavenge\nthese lipids through continuous proliferation. However, lipid metabolic disorders inhibit the function of immune-infiltrating cells\nin the tumor microenvironment through the cross-talk between tumor cells and immunosuppressive stromal cells, thereby\nproviding opportunities for tumor progress. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and lipid-lowering drugs can decrease the\nformation of aberrant crypt foci, lower the burden of the adenomatous polyp, and reduce the incidence of CRC. -is review\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of dyslipidemia on tumorigenesis and tumor progression and a development prospect of\nlipid disorders on tumor immunity.\n1. Introduction\nColorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common\ntype of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related\ndeath worldwide [1], especially among people who engage in\na western pattern diet without appropriate physical exercise\n[2, 3]. In recent years, the mortality and incidence of CRC\nhave been consistently increasing, which is related to many\nfactors. Dyslipidemia is a condition of abnormal lipids, such\nas high triacylglycerol, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol levels, which is characterized by meta-\nbolic disorders highly associated with obesity [4]. It is often\ndue to diet and occurs under several pathological conditions,\nsuch as atherosclerosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or\nlong-termed administration of drugs such as rosiglitazone to\ntreat type 2 diabetes [5]. We have mentioned that, clinically,\nthe resected neoplasm of CRC is usually infiltrated by white\nadipose tissue, regardless of body size. At the same time,\nlarge numbers of epidemiological studies have shown that\nobese people with dyslipidemia, especially those with hyperlipidemia,\nhave a high risk of prostate cancer, lung and\nbronchus cancer, CRC, melanoma, and ovarian cancer.\nPreviously, many studies have mainly focused on the impacts\nof dyslipidemia on tumor progress [6] or specific lipid\ncomponent change of CRC tissue. In addition, the existing\nresearch is mainly concentrated on conventional adenomasderived\ncarcinoma and only deals with one aspect of dys-\nlipidemia on cancer, which is not comprehensive.\nHindawi\nJournal of Oncology\nVolume 2021, Article ID 6640384, 13 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6640384\n', 'Nevertheless, colon cancer may also originate from inflammatory\nbowel disease. Dyslipidemia is associated with\nlong-termed intestinal inflammation [7].\nDyslipidemia will strengthen the inflammatory response\nand have many effects on the occurrence and development\nof colitis-associated CRC in patients with inflammatory\nbowel disease. Chronic intestinal injury destroys the protective\nmucus layer and mucosal epithelium, thus disrupting\nthe balance between intestinal injury and recovery [8].\nAccumulated genetic alteration evolves cancerous transformation.\nIn addition, in the progress of colorectal cancer,\nwhich is significantly different from that of normal mucosal\nepithelium, cell proliferation and survival require reprogramming\nmetabolism of lipogenesis-related enzymes [9].\nTumor lipid metabolism reprogramming affects the systematic\nlipid level as well. Although the prevalence of\ndyslipidemia is positively correlated with the incidence of\ncolitis-associated CRC, the potential relationship is not\ncompletely clear. Previous studies were zooming in on a\ncertain field of abnormalities of lipid disorder on tumor\ngrowth, invasion, and distant metastasis and were not focused\non the occurrence of colitis-associated CRC and its\nprogress [10–12]. In view of the fact that dyslipidemia is an\nimportant part of obesity and the high prevalence of diseases\nrelated to dyslipidemia worldwide, the causal association\nbetween dyslipidemia and colitis-associated CRC should be\nclarified. -is paper summarizes and evaluates the existing\nevidence about dyslipidemia and colitis-associated colorectal\ntumorigenesis and progress, discusses the influence of\ndyslipidemia-related conditions on colitis and the resulting\ntumorigenesis, and analyzes the effects of tumor metabolic\nreprogramming and the tug-of-war between tumor and\ninfiltrating immune cells in response to high fat, to have a\nmore comprehensive understanding and to provide early\nintervention measures.\n2. Dyslipidemia Accelerates ColitisAssociated\nCRC\n2.1. High-Fat Uptake of Intestinal Epithelial Injury.\nInfectious agents, chemical stimulus irritating chronic colitis,\nor even some autoimmune diseases destroy the balance\nbetween intestinal mucosal injury and recovery. -ough the\ngut is teeming with numerous bacteria, gastroenterology has\na solid line of defense against pathogenic microbes [13].\nBowel inflammation is related to mucosal epithelial injury.\nWhen confronted with persistent irritants, activated macrophages\nmove around and swallow agents and then release\nIL-17 to recruit polymorphonuclear cells and other immune\ncells to participate in agent elimination [14], ultimately\nresulting in a microenvironment composed of necrosis\ntissues, immune cells, stromal cells, and cytokines. High-fat\ndiets contribute to enhanced bowel inflammation partly due\nto the strengthened metabolic endotoxemia. Saturated lipids\nplay an important role in accelerating inflammation through\ndirect lipotoxicity, activation, or transformation of toll-like\nreceptor-4 into bioactive forms [15]. A large intake of fat\naltered mucosal permeability and increased the absorption\nof lipopolysaccharide. Continuous serum lipopolysaccharide\nin the diet causes postprandial endotoxemia and inflammatory\npathway activation, which in turn accelerates mu-\ncosal epithelia damage and forms a vicious circle. Crohn’s\ndisease was positively correlated with the prevalence of\nnonalcoholic fatty liver disease [16]. Obese people with fatty\nliver disease seem to be more susceptible mainly due to the\nlower detoxification of steatotic hepatocytes. In addition,\nlong-lasting lipopolysaccharide stimulation can cause lipid\nchanges and aggregates aberrant lipid metabolism [17].\nLipid abnormality has been long involved in enhanced\ninflammatory responses, which focus on the peroxidation of\nlipid and the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n-ese hyperactive oxidants are mainly produced by respiratory\nburst of polymorphonuclear cells. -e imbalance of\nscavenging capacity leads to the oxidative stress of colonic\nmucosal epithelial cells in the microenvironment and induces\nDNA damage [18]. However, long-term hypoxia\nmicroenvironment can also induce increase in nuclear factor\n(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1ɑ\n[19], which decouples fatty acid β-oxidation with the tricarboxylic\nacid cycle, inhibiting the production of ROS, and\npromotes glycolysis to maintain ATP, thus helping the\ndamaged mucosal epithelium survive.\n2.2. Dyslipidemia and Occurrence of Colitis-Related Tumors.\nA previous study showed that high-fat consumption was\naccompanied by an increase in the expression of β-catenin\nand the emergence of carcinogenic bacteria Lachnospiraceae/Streptococcaceae\nin the large intestine of mice [20]. A\nhigh-fat diet can aggravate the inflammatory effect of 1,2dimethylhydrazine\n[21] and the carcinogenic effect of\ndextran sulfate sodium plus azoxymethane [22, 23]. In\ncontrast, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is closely related\nto the occurrence of colorectal tumors and is one of the\ncommon precancerous lesions. A diet rich in animal fat and\nlow in fiber increases the risk of IBD. Dietary fat can be a\nsource of other types of lipids. Western diets are also linked\nto higher bile acids in the intestinal cavity, which is due to\ndamage to the bile acid transporter in the epithelium [24]. In\naddition, the transformation of cholesterol metabolites of\nbile acid by intestinal bacteria can directly promote the\nproliferation of colonic epithelial cells or change the gene\nstructure, induce colonic crypt abnormality [25, 26], and\nmay aggravate the pathogenesis of colitis-associated CRC.\nMoreover, deoxycholic acid accumulation induced by highfat\nintake increased the number of adenomas in ApcMin/+\nmice [27]. In contrast to omega-3 fatty acids, abnormal\ndietary omega-6 fatty acids accelerate the progress of\nCrohn’s disease, mainly due to their conversion to arachidonic\nacids. A combination of abnormal omega-6 fatty acids\nwith the aberrant profile of unsaturated lipid metabolism\nenzymes increases the susceptibility to Crohn’s disease in\nchildren [28].\n-e location of lipid deposition may also influence the\nprogress of colitis. Visceral fat depot, especially mesenteric\nfat, significantly promotes the translocation of gut bacteria\nof Crohn’s disease [29], resulting in the accumulation of\n2 Journal of Oncology\n', 'inflammation. Interestingly, long-lasting intestinal inflammation\nis also highly associated with CRC, especially\nin patients with visceral obesity. Adipocyte malfunction\nplays an important role in facilitating systemic metabolic\ndisorders and inflammation. -e pathogenesis of metabolic\nsyndrome may be related to the accumulation of\nvisceral adipose tissue, which is characterized by the\nconvergence of macrophages, immune cells, and stromal\ncells, leading to adipocyte malfunction and abnormal release\nof adipokine [3]. -e infiltrated M2 subtype mac-\nrophages in the microenvironment exhibit a phenotypic\nswitch from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory\nproperties and secrete inflammatory cytokines, resulting in\nsystemic chronic low-grade inflammation [30]. In addition\nto adipokine disorder, chronic endotoxin can also cause or\naggravate systemic metabolic disorders. In addition,\nsphingosine kinase 1 and sphingosine-1-phosphate, a\ndownstream product of the sphingomyelin metabolic\npathway, play a role in NF-κB-dependent inflammatory\nactivation and accelerate colitis-associated colorectal tumors\n[31].\n-e inflammatory microenvironment is mutagenic.\nHyperlipidemia participates in the strengthened inflammation\nresponse by excessive lipid peroxidation or epige-\nnetic modification, which accelerates the accumulation of\noncogene mutations and promotes the occurrence of inflammation-associated\ncolorectal tumors. -e lack of ade-\nquate DNA repair of damaged colonocytes can lead to\ntumorigenesis. Abnormal lipids change the body homeostasis\nand amplify the ROS/RNS spectrum, thus damaging\nDNA, to accelerate the activation of proto-oncogenes (such\nas Ras) and the inactivation of suppressor genes (such as\nP53), resulting in the loss of cell cycle control and initiation\nof the tumorigenesis [32]. At the same time, the accumulated\ngene mutations of the damaged epithelial gain continuous\nabnormal proliferation capacity and exhibit a trend towards\nheterogeneity, especially for epithelial cells susceptible to\nneoplasia and precancerous lesions such as ulcerative colitis\n(UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Previous\nresearch by Chakrabarty et al. [33] has identified several gene\nmutations in CRC associated with ulcerative colitis, of which\nTP53 (17%), KRAS (22%), APC (33%), and RAF1 (39%)\nhave been observed. Another relevant research by Setia et al.\n[34] showed that the activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways\nwas also involved. Certainly, colonic Crohn’s disease is\ndifferent from UC in that it involves unique hub gene expression.\nIn addition, aberrant proinflammatory interleu-\nkin-6 is a powerful tumor promoter in the early stage of solid\ntumor formation [35]. Interleukin-6 can enable the mutagenic\nepithelial cells to survive and accelerate cellular pro-\nliferation in colitis-related tumorigenesis. Crohn’s disease is\ncharacterized by remitting and relapsing depending on the\nprogress of inflammation. During the interval of the acute\nepisode, both the chronic inflammation response and\nprosurvival factors provide the epithelia with the capacity of\nconstant proliferation, which mainly aims to recover mucosal\ndamage and reconstruct mucosa [36]. Nevertheless,\nhigh fat can activate the intestinal mucosal stem and progenitor\ncells and augment the self-renewal capacity via a\nperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta dependent\nmanner [37]. Uncontrolled cell proliferation indicates the\ninitiation of tumorigenesis.\n2.3. Obesity-Associated Insulin Resistance. Excess lipid deposition\nwithin the skeletal muscle is the main cause of\ninsulin resistance. High levels of fatty acids or lipid metabolites,\nespecially oxidized low-density lipoprotein, can\nactivate CD36+ cells and at the same time reversely inhibit\ninsulin-associated glucose transporter-4, thereby inducing\ninsulin resistance, which is defined as obesity-associated\ninsulin resistance [38, 39]. Stimulation of high fatty acid load\nwill accelerate the secretion of insulin in pancreatic β-cells,\nbut, due to the impaired insulin sensitivity mechanism, the\nphysiological functions of insulin are almost ineffective.\nHyperinsulinemia is involved in tumorigenesis and malignant\ntransformation. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor\n(IGF) have similar homologous fragments and other synergistic\neffects. Both are important determinants of cell\nproliferation and can mediate regulated cell death [40].\nDynamic increase of insulin and IGF has been observed in\nthe process of carcinogenesis from polyps to adenomas and\nadenocarcinomas [41]. -e activation of the insulin and IGF\nsystem exerts many functional effects on the colonic mucosal\nepithelium, leading to increased proliferation and survival of\nthe Ras/MAPK pathway and significantly provoking tumorigenesis\nby the Akt/mTOR pathway [39].\nIn addition, obesity-associated insulin resistance can\naggravate glucose and lipid metabolic disorders. Abnormalities\nof sugar and lipid are often the key to tumor\nmetabolism. -ey may form a vicious circle, which will\neventually promote tumor progress. Hyperglycemia is\npositively correlated with electron leakage in the mitochondrial\nelectron transport chain, which is closely related\nto DNA damage and the resultant tumorigenesis [42]. Individuals\nwith higher fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides,\nand total cholesterol are closely associated with the risk of\ncolorectal neoplasm. Synergy effects by glucose intolerance\nand abnormal lipid metabolism accelerate the occurrence\nand development of colorectal neoplasm [43, 44]. In addition,\nvisceral adipocytes and body mass index play a role in\nthe development of a colorectal neoplasm. -e study of Del\nCornò et al. [45] showed that visceral adipocytes of obese or\nCRC individuals were involved in pathways related to the\nmetabolism of pyruvate, lipids, and glucose and processes\nrelevant to carcinogenesis. It indicated that visceral adipocytes\nmay participate in the establishment of a favorable\ntumor microenvironment.\n2.4. Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. -e administration of nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) lowers the inci-\ndence and remits the malignance of CRC, which provides\nconclusive evidence for the close relationship between chronic\nintestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis. Eicosanoid metabolites\nfrom arachidonic acid under the action of cyclo-\noxygenase or lipoxygenase participate in cellular signaling\ntransduction as lipidmediators, resulting in both pro- and antiinflammatory\neffects, and are associated with the occurrence of\nJournal of Oncology 3\n', 'colitis-associated tumorigenesis [46]. -e increase of cyclooxygenases-2\nin the normal mucosa adjacent to adenoma or\nadenocarcinoma in overweight individuals indicates that\nobesity, especially abdominal obesity, increases the risk of\ntumorigenesis. Prostaglandins are important mediators of\ninflammation and tumorigenesis. Many types of research have\nshown that prostaglandin levels are different in various tumors,\nsuch as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and\novarian cancer [47–49]. Notably, prostaglandins play an important\nrole in the development of inflammation and colitis-\nassociated cancer. -eir receptor subtype prostaglandin E2 is\nmainly expressed in neutrophils and tumor-associated fibroblasts\nin the tumor microenvironment, has been found in\ncolitis-associated colorectal tumor biopsies, and is positively\ncorrelated with cyclooxygenase-2 content [50]. -e activation\nof prostaglandin E2 induced by a long-termed inflammation\nleads to Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activation, which\nplays an important role in the carcinogenesis of digestive\nsystem tumors [51]. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a\ncomponent of the β-catenin destruction complex, which can\naccelerate the decomposition of β-catenin.-e absence of APC\ninversely increases the incidence of CRC in ApcMin/+ mice.\n-e increase of cyclooxygenase-2 is positively correlated\nwith tumorigenesis, and the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on\ncyclooxygenases is well known. Long-termed administration\nof NSAIDs reduces the incidence of colitis, decreases the\nformation of aberrant crypt foci defined as the early stage of\ncolon carcinoma, and lowers the adenomatous polyp burden\nin patients with familial adenomatous polyposis [52], but it\nincreases the side effects of cardiovascular and digestive\nevents, particularly gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding [53].\n-e selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor significantly reduced\nthese side effects. It is generally believed that tumors\noriginate from cancer stem cells. A recent study applying a\nselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor to treat cancer stem\ncells eliminated early tumor regrowth [54]. Toll-like receptor-4\nis associated with the activation of cyclooxygenase-\n2, the expression of downstream prostaglandins, and the\nstimulation of endogenous growth factor ligands and exerts\nimportant effects on colitis-associated CRC in ulcerative\ncolitis [55]. -e stimulation of toll-like receptor-4 by bacteria\nlipopolysaccharide or ROS activates the NF-κB path-\nway. Hyperactivity of cyclooxygenase is partially mediated\nby the NF-κB pathway. In addition, inflammatory cytokines\nsuch as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-ɑ synergistically\nlaunch the transcription of more diverse cytokines\nand cyclooxygenase and accelerate angiogenesis through the\ninduction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1ɑ, thus accelerating\nthe progress of inflammatory [56].-ey form a positive feedforward\nloop. However, free saturated fatty acids rather than\npolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) strengthened this\nprocess [57]. In contrast, a study by Larsson et al. [58]\nshowed that n–3 PUFAs interfered with the activation of the\nNF-κB pathway and competitively inhibited arachidonic\nacid metabolism, thus partially suppressing the\ninflammation.\n2.5. Lipid Regulators. Dyslipidemia is highly associated with\nsystematic metabolic diseases including cancer. Longtermed\nlipid challenges can aggravate chronic inflammation\nof gastrointestinal diseases. Nevertheless, the administration\nof anti-inflammatory drugs or lipid regulators can reduce the\nincidence of digestive tract cancer. -e use of statins reduces\nmorbidity and cancer-related mortality. -is suggests that\nearly intervention in the correction of lipids disorder is\nessential [59]. -is also shows that early intervention is\nnecessary to correct dyslipidemia. -ere is evidence that\ncorrecting dyslipidemia is beneficial to control inflammation\nand reduce the incidence of IBD and related tumors. A\nrecent IBD cohort study showed that lipid-lowering drug\nstatin reduced the incidence of colorectal tumors [60].\nStatins competitively inhibit endogenous cholesterol synthesis\nrate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, block\nintracellular mevalonate metabolism pathways, and lower\nintracellular cholesterol synthesis. More and more evidence\nshows that statins have many important antitumor effects. In\naddition, oxidized phospholipids damage cell membranes\nand significantly promote inflammatory response [61]. A\nstudy by Merwether et al. [62] demonstrated that apolipoprotein\nmimetics improved the inflammation of IBD in-\nduced by oxidized phosphatidylcholine. -is may be\nexplained by the combining of lipids with lipoproteins for\ntransportation and subsequent metabolic shift. In addition,\nmetabolites of short-chain fatty acid from fiber by digestive\ntract bacteria can maintain epithelial integrity by the receptor-activated\nmanner and epigenetic modification [63].\nAdjusting the diet structure by a complement of soluble fiber\nor omega-3 fatty acids improves inflammation response.\nAlthough they showed no benefits to patients with IBD [64],\nfiber-like pectin and cellulose indeed alleviated the severity\nof dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice [65].\nLikewise, olive oil supplements improved the severity of\ndextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice [66]. Furthermore,\nevidence showed that complement of soy iso-\nflavones improved intestinal permeability, lowered serum\nlipid, inhibited inflammatory response, and corrected intestinal\nmicrobiota imbalance of obese rats [67].\n3. Abnormalities of LipidMetabolism in Tumor\nCells Accelerate Disease Progress\n3.1. Exogenous Lipid Uptake of Cancer. -e lipid pools are\nmainly derived from endogenous synthesis and exogenous\nabsorption. Quiescent cells usually consume and utilize\nexogenous fatty acids for degradation for energy. However,\nthe direct absorption of exogenous fatty acids enables\nproliferating cells to bypass the activation of acetyl-CoA and\nmodulate the source of lipid pool as an alternative manner to\nmeet a high proliferation rate. Under certain nutritionally\nsufficient conditions, exogenous fatty acids are the first\nchoice for membrane blocks over endogenous synthesis in\ncertain proliferating cells, such as fibroblasts [68, 69]. Exogenous\nlong-chain fatty acids are absorbed by the trans-\nmembrane channel cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36).\nLipoprotein lipase (LPL), a dimerizing secretase, is a key\nenzyme for extracellular lipolysis, which catalyzes triglyceride-rich\nchylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein\nparticles to become free fatty acids that are subsequently\n4 Journal of Oncology\n', 'absorbed by CD36 in adipose and striated muscle [70]. LPL\nis highly expressed in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the\nheart. It was reported that LPL exerts a noncatalytic function\nthrough receptor-mediated endocytosis to uptake and accumulate\nlipoproteins [71]. In addition, lipolysis, in some\ncancer cell lines, is another way for fatty acids acquisition.\nSome malignant tumors integrate the membrane surface\nwith LPL rather than simply secreting it. -e membraneassociated\nLPL dimers mediate extracellular hydrolysis\n(Figure 1: lipogenesis and Lipolysis), to convert the esterified\nfatty acid into free fatty acid, but also facilitate intracellular\nhydrolysis by acting as a nonenzymatic bridge. In addition,\nfatty acid transporters on the cellular membrane assist in the\ntransport of extracellular fatty acids. At the same time, shortchain\nfatty acids and sterols can be uptaken in the form of\nfree diffusion. -us, they enable malignant tumor cells to\nacquire continuous fatty acids.\n3.2. Endogenous Lipid Synthesis of Cancer. -e most\nprominent and common characteristics of cancer are the\nnovel metabolic reprogramming of aerobic glycolysis and\nlipid synthesis. Aerobic glycolysis, known as the “Warburg\neffect,” is a characteristic of most cancer cells and indeed all\nproliferating cells (such as activated immune cells). Tumors\ntend to synthesize endogenous lipids, using biomass from\naerobic glycolysis of glucose, but also uptake extracellular\nfatty acids through membrane enzymes as an alternative\nsource of lipid pools [72, 73]. -is enables tumor cells to\nfacilitate and incorporate glucose into biomass, making it\nfatty acids, amino acids, and nucleotides required for proliferation\nrather than efficient ATP generation [74]. Previous\nresearch by Reynier et al. [75] showed that, compared with\ncolonic cells, undifferentiated human colon cancer cells\nexhibited elevated phospholipid profile with a significant\ndifference of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine,\namong which the composition of unsaturated fatty acid\nvaried. -e upregulated lipid metabolism required by the\ntumor is reflected by the overexpression and hyperactivity of\nvarious enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis\n(Figure 1: lipogenesis and lipolysis). Fatty acid synthase\n(FASN) is the rate-limiting enzyme for endogenous lipogenesis,\nwhich is essential for growth and proliferation. -e\nincrease of de novo synthetic lipids caused by the upregulation\nof FASN is one of the most noteworthy metabolic\nhallmarks of cancer [76]. Cancers such as colorectal carcinoma\nand prostate carcinoma show a transition to con-\ntinuous fatty acid synthesis due to the significant increase\nand hyperactivity of lipid metabolic enzymes, regardless of\nthe availability of extracellular lipids. However, except for\nthe liver and adipose tissue with high expression of FASN,\nnormal cells give priority to exogenous lipids [77]. Furthermore,\nmonoacylglycerol lipase together with hormone-\nsensitive lipase catalyzes the degradation of triglyceride\nstored in intracellular lipid droplets, exerting a stream of\nintracellular free fatty acids. In the face of a harsh environment,\ntumor cells strengthen fat mobilization by re-\nleasing fatty acids from neutral lipids and obtaining large\nnumbers of energy sources. Extracellular and intracellular\nfatty acids were esterified with the same neutral lipids or\nphospholipids and further incorporated into the membrane\nas cellular blocks in the correlation of proliferation rate. As\nlipid mediators, bioactive fatty acids also regulate signaling\ntransduction through an array of signaling molecules [78].\nNevertheless, some fatty acids are directly transported and\noxidized in mitochondria as energy sources. Meanwhile,\nexcess fatty acids are stored in lipid droplets for restoring\nenergy. In addition, increased lipid metabolism not only\nserves as a tool for membrane synthesis, but also affects\ncellular morphology and polarization. Hyperactivity of\nFASN can elicit Wnt-1 palmitoylation, resulting in continuous\nactivation of β-catenin. In addition, ATP-citrate\nlyase (ACLY) catalyzes the formation of acetyl coenzyme A\nfrom citric acid, which is a precursor of mevalonate acid and\nfatty acid synthesis through successive condensation reactions\nand is overexpressed in colon cancer [79]. Acetyl\ncoenzyme A is a substrate of acetylationmodification as well.\nAcetylation modification of genes or proteins is important in\ncell biology. Posttranscriptional acetylation modification of\nhistones mediates chromatin architectures and promotes\ngene expression.\nSeveral studies have described special cellular mechanisms\nassociated with lipids maintenance in tumor tissues\n[77, 79, 80]. -ese lipid-involved metabolic enzymes are\naffected by several factors, and their functions are reminiscent\nof the combination of a growth factor with its\ntyrosine kinases receptor to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway,\nwhich stimulates cell proliferation and survival. In this\npathway, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 is a\nvital transcriptional factor associated with the gene transcription\nof intracellular lipid-relevant enzymes, under the\nregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex1\n[81]. -e activation of the mammalian target of rapa-\nmycin complex-1 stimulates the uptake of exogenous\nglucose, strengthens glycolysis, and increases the quantity\nof NADPH through an enhanced pentose phosphate\npathway, which provides precursors for fatty acid synthesis.\nAlthough fatty acids are necessary for tumor progress,\ninhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway or chemical inhibitors\nand RNAi-mediated inhibition of key enzymes of lipid\nmerely moderate tumor proliferation but do not play a\nsignificant role in tumor inhibition [82]. Interestingly,\nthese effects can be partially restored by fatty acid supplementation,\nwhich implies a cross-talk network of tu-\nmors related to lipid metabolism control and emphasizes\nthat the availability of exogenous fatty acids in the diet may\ndisrupt the newly established balance of lipid homeostasis\nand exert detrimental effects of cancer therapy [83].\n3.3. Unsaturated Lipid Metabolism of Cancer. -e consumption\nof a diet high in red meat and low in fiber or fish\nmay cause changes in the ratio of membrane polyunsaturated\nfatty acids to saturated fatty acids (P/S) [84]. -e lower\nP/S ratio may contribute to the decreased fluidity of the\nmembrane and the impaired function of the membrane.\nPhosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine constitute\nthe majority of membrane structures [85]. -e fatty\nJournal of Oncology 5\n', 'acid composition of these phospholipids significantly\nchanges the fluidity of the membrane and subsequently\ninfluences cell metabolism. Overwhelmed palmitates, incorporated\ninto phospholipid and triglyceride species of the\nmembrane, increased the content of saturated lipid, which\nadversely affects the membrane movement and function of\nnonadipose tissue. It is well known that these accumulated\nsaturated fatty acids and neutral lipids in nonadipose tissue\nrapidly stimulate apoptosis [86]. On the other hand, tumors\ndetoxify their lipotoxicity by upregulating the activities of\nenzymes related to lipid metabolism. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1\n(SCD-1) is the key enzyme that is responsible for\nthe double bond formation of a stearoyl-CoA. Igal et al.\nproved that high expression and hyperactivity of SCD1 exist\nin the pathogenesis of many tumors [87], which may explain\nthe high metabolic rate of tumors due to high membrane\nfluidity and nutrient substances communication. Both oleic\nand palmitoleic acid are important precursors for the biosynthesis\nof complex lipid species, including phospholipids,\ntriglyceride, and cholesterol esters. In addition, lipid mediators\nusually contain a component of unsaturated fatty\nacid. -e mammalian cell membrane is composed of a\nhigher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It improves\nthe fluidity of the cell membrane and causes the cell\nmembrane to be more permeable, which is one of the key\nreasons for a highmetabolic rate in mammals. What is more,\nSCD-1 accelerated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by\nproducing unsaturated fatty acids and inhibiting the activity\nof tumor suppressor PTEN [88]. Meanwhile, SCD-1 inhibitors\nreduced cell proliferation rate and caused a di-\nminished capacity for anchorage-independent growth via\nthe endoplasmic reticulum stress response mechanism for a\nhigher proportion of saturated fatty acids of the endoplasmic\nreticulum membrane. -e overlap of palmitate acid results\nin delayed cell replication due to endoplasmic reticulum\nstress [89].

Following several key enzymes\ninvolved in lipogenesis, acetyl-CoA is aggregated as 16-carbon saturated palmitate.

However, a study by Ducheix et al. [91] showed that\noleic acids supplement inhibited inflammation and decreased\ncrypt formation of SCD1−/−ApcMin/+ mice. To some\nextent, unsaturated fatty acids also exert antioxidative effects\nand reduce the incidence of stress-induced genomic damage.\nIn addition, n−3 PUFA supplements may be beneficial to\npeople with advanced cancer and cachexia and, to some\ndegree, improve appetite, weight, and quality of life. -e\nincorporation of n−3 PUFAs (such as docosahexaenoic acid)\ninto the membrane can increase the activity of the insulin\nreceptor and improve insulin sensitivity. It is suggested that\nPUFAs in the daily diet play a guiding role in the prevention\nof obesity and obesity-associated colon cancer [92].\n4. Immunosuppression by Lipid Challenge\nConnives the Progress of Cancer\nLipid homeostasis plays an important role in immune\nfunction. -e persistent lipid attack has an immunosuppressive\neffect on immune cells. -e elevated absorption of\nexogenous lipid in dendritic cells can lead to the accumulation\nof lipid droplets, thereby impairing the antigen pre-\nsentation of tumor immune to T lymphocyte [93]. It can be\nexplained that the oxidized truncated lipids in the lipid\ndroplets hurt the chaperone heat-shock protein 70 through\ncovalent binding, contributing to the dysfunction in the\ntransport of peptide-MHC to the membrane surface [94].\nDysregulation of the immune system fails to execute immune\nsurveillance and immune clearance against cancer,\nwhich provides opportunities for tumor development. A\nprevious study by Luck et al. [95] proved that excessive fat\nintake altered the population of immune cells in the intestinal\nlamina propria and impaired immune functions of\nthe intestine, which may lead to the occurrence of colorectal\nneoplasm. Similarly, Tie et al. [96] proved that high cholesterol\nlevels eroded the hematopoietic stem cells through\nepigenetic modification, resulting in the decrease in the\nnumber and activity of the NKT and cδT cells in the submucosa\nof the colon. Excessive fat intake not only promotes\ninflammation response but also accelerates colitis-related\nCRC by recruiting CC-chemokine-receptor-6 positive\nB cells and cδT cells through ligand-receptor interaction\n[22].\nAbnormal lipid metabolism has a negative impact on\nsystemic immune monitoring and local immune cell\nfunction. Lipid metabolic disorder not only inhibits the\nsystematic immune function but also suppresses the immune-infiltrating\ncell function in the tumor microenvi-\nronment by regulating the immunosuppressive function\nthrough the cross-talk between metabolic reprogramming\ntumor cells and surrounding stromal cells (such as M2\nmacrophages, monocytes), thereby accelerating the tumor\nprogress. Tumor cells in the microenvironment deprive\nimmune-infiltrating cells of energy supply by depleting\nglucose, thereby eroding the immunity [97], and trick them\ninto the obesity trap by utilizing surrounding lipids as the\nenergy source instead of glucose. Nevertheless, cholesterol\nis adequate in the microenvironment. -e binding of\ncholesterol with the TCR receptors affected its multimerization\nand functional region, suppressed the immune\nactivation of adaptive immunity, and enhanced the T-cell\nexhaustion. What is more, high cholesterol content restrained\nimmune function by holding up the anticancer\nproperty of CD8+ T lymphocyte with a high expression of\nimmune checkpoint programmed cell death protein-1 and\nT-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3\n[98]. However, in response to available fat, tumor cells\nreprogramed their metabolism to better plunder energyrich\nlipids and rapidly scavenged these lipids through\ncontinuous proliferation, which further deprived\nT lymphocyte of energy and accelerated the tumor progress.\nFurthermore, lipid droplets are a reservoir of in-\nflammatory mediators and play an important role in tumor\nimmunity in the interaction between tumors and stromal\ncells [99]. PGE2 derived of arachidonic acid in tumors\npromoted the resistance of immunotherapy [100]. In response\nto the effects of IFN-c, the paracrine secreted tumor\nPGE2 promotes the translocation of p50 NF-κB into the\nnuclear of monocytes and macrophages, thereby contributing\nto the production of immunosuppressive nitric oxide,\nwhich induced the immune dysfunction of T lymphocyte\nby interfering TNF-α [101]. Moreover, other than cytokine\nsignaling in the microenvironment, unsaturated fatty acids\nthemselves can also induce the phenotypic transition of\nmyeloid cells to immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages\n[102].\nIn addition, hyperlipidemia slows down the hemodynamics,\naccompanied by an increased platelet count in tumor\npatients, which leads to a hypercoagulability state. On the\ncontrary, it provides the remaining tumor cells with a chance to\nsurvive and the distance metastasis of circulation cells. Furthermore,\nthe chronic inflammatory of fatty liver disease in-\ncreases the susceptibility of steatosis hepatocytes, affects the\nfunction of liver macrophages, and increases the risk of tumor\nliver metastasis. Similarly, a study by Ma et al. [103] showed\nthat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can affect the survival rate\nof CD4+ T lymphocytes and lead to a decrease in the CD4+/\nCD8+ ratio, which is mainly due to the high context of C18 : 2\nfatty acids (especially linoleic acid). In addition, dietary changes\naffect the diversity of CD4+ T-cell receptors [104]. -is may\nhelp reveal the tendency of liver metastasis of colorectal cancer\n(Figure 2: dyslipidemia upon colorectal cancer).\nJournal of Oncology 7\n', '5. Conclusion and Perspective\nIn this paper, lipid components of unsaturated and saturated\nfatty acids, triglyceride, cholesterol, and phospholipid, as\nwell as relevant enzymes to the occurrence and development\nof colitis-associated colorectal cancer, were exploited. Inflammatory\nbowel disease is more vulnerable to hyperlip-\nidemia. Long-lasting intake of large amounts of fat can\ndamage the epithelial junctions, alter the distribution of\nintestinal bacteria flora, and lead to lipopolysaccharide-induced\nendotoxemia and activation of the inflammatory\npathway. It accelerates the injury of the mucosal epithelium\nand forms a vicious circle. -e enhancement of oxidative\nstress and the turbulence of inflammatory mediators of the\nmicroenvironment have a great influence on the occurrence\nof tumors. In the repetitive phase of colitis, chronic inflammation\nenables these epithelial cells to continuously\nproliferate under the stimulation of prosurvival factors. -e\nmain purpose is to reconstruct the mucosa, but it is also\nimplicated in the occurrence and malignancy of CRC.\n-e metabolic reprogramming of aerobic glycolysis and\nlipid synthesis converts raw carbohydrate and amino acid\nsubstrates into protein, nucleic acid, and lipid building\nblocks, which are required for sister cells. In the correlation\nof proliferation rate, esterified phospholipids are incorporated\ninto the membrane as cell masses. Unsaturated fatty\nacids of phospholipids improve the fluidity of the cell\nmembrane and cause permeable cell membranes, which is\none of the key reasons for a high metabolic rate in mammals.\nIn response to available fat, tumor cells reprogramed their\nmetabolism to better plunder energy-rich lipids and rapidly\nscavenged these lipids through continuous proliferation.\nHowever, long-term lipid stimulation has an immunosuppressive\neffect on immune cells, resulting in immune sur-\nveillance and immune clearance dysfunction, which\nprovides opportunities for tumor occurrence and distant\nmetastasis. Lipid metabolic disorder not only inhibits the\nsystematic immune function but also suppresses the immune-infiltrating\ncell function in the tumor microenvi-\nronment by regulating the immunosuppressive function\nthrough the cross-talk between metabolic reprogramming\ntumor cells and surrounding stromal cells, thereby accelerating\nthe tumor progress.\nIn the absence of carcinogenic stimulation, a high-fat\ndiet did not increase the incidence of obesity-related CRC in\nwild-type mice. However, for the precancerous lesion model\nof ApcMin/+ mice and azoxymethane-induced colitis, excess\nfat increased the incidence of colon tumors [105]. Likewise,\nlong-lasting high-fat uptake accelerated the progress of the\ncolitis-associated colorectal tumor. Visceral adipocytes may\nparticipate in establishing a favorable tumor microenvironment\nand play a role in the occurrence of colorectal\nneoplasm. Furthermore, obesity-associated insulin resistance\naggravates both glucose and lipid metabolic disorders,\nwhich are key factors to tumor metabolism and eventually\npromote the progress of tumors.\nArachidonic pathway inhibitors of NSAIDs have been\nshown to efficiently decrease the formation of aberrant crypt\nAutophagy block\nImmune checkpoint \nHematopoietic stem cell erosion\nCD4+/CD8+ ratio\nDecreased cell number \nCancer cell\nFibroblast\ncell\nCancer cell\nImmune cell\nEpithelial cell\nCancer cell\nImmune cell\nInvasive\ncancer cell\nCancer cell Immune\n cell\nOncogenes activation\nSuppressor genes Inactivation\nCOX/prostaglandin\nSCD-1\nROS/RNS \nLipid peroxidation\nGenome instabbility \nand mutation Genome instability \nand mutatuion\nStem cell maintenance\nNeovascularization\n\x02rombocyte\nHypercoagulability\nDecreased shear stress Metastasis EMT\nInvasive cancer cell\nHydrolase\nCellular polarity lose\nWnt/β-catenin\nCadherin\nAmoeboid movement\nEpithelial cell\nAngiogenesis\nFibroblast\ncell\nTumor \nmicroenvironment\nOxidative stress \nCytokines/adipokine\nNF-κB\nChronic imflamation\nVEGF/VEGFR\nTGF-β\nHIF-1a/ Nrf-2\nNOS\nDyslipidemia\nImmunosuppression\nProliferation\nFigure 2: Schematic diagram of dyslipidemia upon colorectal cancer. -is provides a comprehensive understanding of tumorigenesis and\nprogress of cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, migration, and immunosuppression. -ese insights will facilitate further developments\nof new drugs.\n8 Journal of Oncology\n', 'foci, lower the burden of the adenomatous polyp, and reduce\nthe incidence of CRC. Nevertheless, lipid regulators can\nreduce the incidence of colitis-associated CRC. -is indicates\nthat the tumorigenesis of colitis-associated CRC is\nclosely related to intestinal inflammation and lipid abnormality.\nIt is of practical significance to reduce the formation\nof intestinal tumors and lower the burden of tumors by\nintervening with the inflammatory response and the disorder\nof lipid metabolism.\n-e lipogenesis-relevant enzymes in CRC elicited by the\nreprogramed metabolism are required to acquire energy to\nmeet the high proliferation rate of cells and to help cells\nsurvive even in a harsh environment. Tumors mainly facilitate\nthe synthesis of endogenous fatty acids by FASN and\nabsorb extracellular fatty acids as another way of lipid pools.\nHigh expression and hyperactivity of SCD-1 may be one of\nthe reasons to explain the high metabolic rate of tumors\nbecause of its high membrane fluidity and nutrient substances\ncommunication. Tumor lipid metabolic reprog-\nramming, in turn, affects serum cholesterol and high-density\nlipoprotein level [106]. However, we speculate that the\nenzymes involved in lipid metabolism can be potential\ntherapeutic targets for cancer. Chemical inhibition or RNAimediated\nsuppression of key enzymes in lipid metabolism\ncan slow down tumor proliferation and promote apoptosis\nbut can be rescued by the supplement of fatty acids.\n-erefore, diet restriction and moderate physical activity are\nessential. Despite therapeutic methods on these targeted key\nenzymes to retain the accumulation of lipid mass, targeting\npotential lipid scavenging ways may work simultaneously. In\naddition, the application of colon endoscopic screening is\nwarranted to detect precancerous and malignant lesions to\nreduce the morbidity and mortality of CRC, marking the\ncornerstones of cancer prevention. -is paper was concentrated\non colitis-associated CRC, focused on the cancer-\npromoting effect of abnormal lipid metabolism on colitis,\nand analyzed the response of colorectal cancer cells and the\ntug-of-war between tumor cells and immune cells to the high\nfat, thus providing a comprehensive understanding of the\ninfluence of dyslipidemia on tumorigenesis and a prospect\nfor the development of lipid disorder on the tumor immunity.\n-ese opinions summarize the overall under-\nstanding of dyslipidemia in tumor biology and are expected\nto promote further development of new anticancer drugs.\nTumor exploits several novel mechanisms to cope with\ntherapeutic pressure and promote deterioration, adding the\nchallenge of antitumor. -ere is evidence that excessive\nsaturated lipids packed more densely and altered the kinetics\nof lateral and transverse membrane due to the upregulation\nof FANS or the RNAi-mediated SCD-1, resulting in reduced\nmembrane permeability and drug resistance, highlighting\nthe challenges of anticancer drug therapy [107]. In addition,\ntumor cells take full advantage of autologous substances to\nsurvive even in the hard environment, known as autophagy,\nby systematically swallowing and decomposing cellular\ncomponents, such as lipid droplets and misfolded proteins,\nto support a dynamic recycling system to maintain ATP,\nwhich is generally maintained at basal levels. Furthermore,\nthe liver is the most common target viscus for distant\nmetastasis of digestive tract cancer on account of special\nanatomy. It is significantly urgent to uncover the mechanism\nby which nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and resultant liver\ncirrhosis suffer higher risks of CRC liver metastasis as well.\n-ere is still more that we should focus on, and more effective\nmeasures should be taken.\nData Availability\nAll data used in this study are included within the article.\nDisclosure\n-e authors declare that they do not have a financial relationship\nwith any commercial entity that has an interest in\nthe subject of this manuscript.\nConflicts of Interest\n-e authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest\nregarding the publication of this article.\nAuthors’ Contributions\nKe Chen and Jianrong Guo contributed equally to this work.\nAcknowledgments\n-is study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation\nof China (No. 81570568 to Jiliang Wang, No. 82070647 to\nJiliang Wang, and No. 81602419 to Huili Li).\nReferences\n[1] F.
