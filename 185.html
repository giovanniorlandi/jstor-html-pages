Mc.\nIt is xery gratifying indeed to receive\nsuch letters as the above, and to know\nthat the Home Health club work Is doing\nBuch & world of good. In this case, a\nbeautiful and accomplished young lady\nwas rapidly going down and suffering\ntorture Eight and day. A number of\nphysicians were called, but medicine\ncould cot reach the case. A friend of\nthe family, who had profited by the club\nmethods, advised thcra to tell the club\nall about the case. I received a long\nletter, detailing the symptoms and\ntreatments given, and at last, almost as\nan after-thought, told of falling while\nBkating. I promptly advised osteopathy,\nand It was found that the spine was caus\ning all the trouble. I believe that a\ncomplete cure will result, although the\ncase looked almost hopeless from a med\nical standpoint. Drugs have their place,\nand are sometimes necessary, but ir\nmany cases dependence upon thcra blinds\nus to the real cause of disease which can\nbe removed without, them.\nAll communications for the "Home\nHealth club should be addressed to Dr.\nDavid H.

Also, that\nother organs, th function of which is\nto eliminate the waste matter from the\nsystem, are not properly doing their\nduty. The severe pains in the bad\nare no doubt caused by uric acid, which\nwould not be the case If the kidneys were\nproperly performing their duty. She\nwould be greatly benefited by thorough\nhot fomentations, about twice per\nweals, across the back where the seat of\nthe pain is found. This should be taken\nat night, just before retiring. After\nwards the place should be rubbed dry,\nand either olive oil or the vegetable rem\nedy In liquid form rubbed in thoroughly.\nSae \'should also adopt the additional\nmethods of treatment and general plan\nof diet of which I wrote you, and also\ndrink freely of fresh buttermilk as\noften as she can get it.

I have just been\nreading- a lobg chapter upon that dread\ndisease. The writer advocates the hy\ndropathic method of cum, and hissug\nBestions are scientific and sensible.\nWhen used by a nurse in the case of a\nbedridden patient, they are the most\npractical I have ever examined. But\nt he majority of persons affected are not\nInvalids in fact, they setm, to enjoy\nperfect health In every way except a\ntired feeling caused by loss of sleep.\nMany people can readily hypnotize\nthemselves, but with some, the more\nthey try to concentrate or compose the\nmind, the tafher they get from sleep.\nDrugs congest the b!oodk and thus stupe\nfy the brain; a condition of coma re\nsembling sleep ensues, but the person is\nnot refreshed nor rested as by natural\nsleep. Where insomnia Is caused by\nover-activity of the brain, It Is only\nnecessary to draw the blood away from\nthe head to some other portion of the\nbody, and if this is accomplished in anat\nural and legitimate manner, the result\nIs beneficial, and the sleep which ensues\naccomplished the work for which it was\ndesigned. For brain workers this re\nsult may bo easily and naturally accom\nplished by a simple, quiet method of ex\nercise aftor going to bed.\nThe first requisite is plenty of pure,\nfresh air, and not too much bed clothing.\nBefore or after retiring practice deep\nbreathing for 10 or 15 minutes, Inhaling\nes well as exhaling all of the air pos\nsible. If that is done after retiring,\nthe pillow should be removed bo that\nthe body lies on a level. After feeling\nsure that the blood has been thorough\nly oxygenized, direct the mind to each\nportion of the body as it Is exercised, and\nthink of that only.\nFirst, with both hands, thoroughly\nmassage the back of the head and neck,\nmoving the flesh deeply In all directions,\nand then rotate the head from side to\nside as far as possible, while It is raised\nslightly from the bed. After this has\nbeen done about two dozen times, the\npillow may be replaced and the mind\nshould be directed to the muscles of the\nback, and they should be tensed and re\nlaxed that is, made hard and firm, as\nif for a lift or hard muscular effort, and\nthen relaxed. Every muscle of the body\nmay, in this manner, be brought under\nthe direction of the active willand ex\nercised at pleasure. This process should\nbe continued downward until the feet\nare reached, when they should be\nstretched as far as possible from the\nhead downward, at the same time press\ning upward with the top of the head and\ndownward with the hands.\nRelax and push down with only the\nright foot, making the toe describe a cir\ncle as widely as possible, while holding\nthe leg rigid. Repeat 24 times, and\nthen make thesame experiment with the\nleft foot.\nFlex the right knee, bringing it as far\nand as strongly upward as possible.\nWhile in this position tense and relax\nthe muscles of the leg from hip to toe\n24 times Repeat with left leg.\nNow direct the thoughts to the arms,\nand place them at full length by the side.\nAgain repeat the tensing and relaxing\nexercise ten times, and then flex thearm\nunt il the hand Is Just over the branchial\nplexus, which Is a point between the\nshoulders and the center of the cheft.\nHold the hand a little above the chest,\nso that it does not touch the body, then\ntense and relax ten times.\nLie upon the right side, and you will\nbe asleep, almost as soon as yon have\nceased the work. Care should be used\nthat the mind remains fixed upon the\nexercise, for if it gets ba k to the braif\nwork whirh caused the trouble, it Is It\nable to undo your work and remain\nawake in spite of you, but this is not\nlikely.\nThese exercises will have a tendency\nto promote the general health, and will\ngreatly strengthen the muscles. Only one\ndifficulty will be hard to overcome In\nthese exercises, and that is to relax\nthe head and neck after the rotation of\nthe former frn right to left. Allow\nthe head to rest easily and calmly upon\nthe pillow, and allow no strain to be\nmanifest in the neck. Relax the jaws,\nalso, as they are generally set hard to\ngether during s\'eepleMness, and relaxed\nduring sleep. j\nEat no meat or other muscle-making\nfood for supper; fruit, rice, milk, toast,\nor other light articles are best. A glass\nof very hot milk just before retiring is\nan excellent thing, as it soothes the\nnerves and strengthens the entire body.\nIt should not be boiled, but heated to\nthe boiling point, and then sipped slowly\nwith a teaspoon.\nCLUB NOTES.\nGarrets vl lie.
