        <pre>['Rivalry of Russia, China and Japan\nIn Manchuria\nBy A. M . N IK O L A IE F F\nFormer Colonel in  the R ussian A rmy; Specialist on F ar E astern A ffairs\nON Nov. 23, 1927, a group of influential \nChinese financiers and business men \nsent a cable to the Chinese Minister \nat Washington requesting him to present \nto Secretary of State Kellogg and the \nAmerican people their resolution opposing \nloans to the South Manchuria Railway by \nthe Morgan interests, whose alleged inten\xad\ntion to make such loans has been the sub\xad\nject of persistent rumors since the recent \nvisit to Japan of Thomas W. Lamont of \nJ. P. Morgan & Co. This action by promi\xad\nnent Chinese business men shows the seri\xad\nousness of the situation in Manchuria from \nthe purely Chinese point o f view. That \nthe Chinese have every reason to be alarmed \nat that situation is undeniable. The Jap\xad\nanese menace to Chinese interests in Man\xad\nchuria is clearly outlined in this resolution, \nwhich asserts that the South Manchuria \nRailway is an “ imperialistic Japanese po\xad\nlitical and economic instrument,”  and that \nthe line is not a commercial enterprise but \none used by Japan to promote her aggres\xad\nsive policy in Manchuria and Mongolia.\nThere are certain areas on the political \nmap of the continents which seem to have \nbeen predestined by fate to form entangled \nknots of conflicting interests and to create \ninternational problems, the solution of \nwhich is not only fraught with great dif\xad\nficulties, but may even become the cause \nof a dangerous conflagration. Of such \nareas a very prominent, if  not the ranking, \nplace has been assigned to Manchuria, \nwhere the vital interests of three Powers— \nChina, Russia and Japan—are closely inter\xad\nwoven and in their progressive development \nare bringing about a dangerous situation.\n“ Manchuria,”  says a Chinese scholar (Dr. \nShuhsi Hsii: Chino, and Her Political En\xad\ntity, 1926), who has recently made a study \nof that problem, “ forms today the only \noutlet for the Chinese millions of the \nNorth.” It is for the Chinese people “ easily \nas vital as the throat.” Ample evidence \nin support of the above statement is con\xad\ntained in the facts relating to Manchuria’s \ncolonization, beginning from the establish\xad\nment of the Manchu rule over China (17th \ncentury) and extending to our own days.\nOriginally Manchuria was not Chinese. \nIt was the land of Manchu tribes of nomads \nwhich were united about the middle of the \nsixteenth century by one of their chief\xad\ntains (Nurhachu), who assumed the title \nof Emperor. In the next century the Man- \nchus established their rule over China and \nManchuria became an extramural part of \nthe Chinese empire. In 1776, in conformity \nwith the fixed policy of the Manchus to \nisolate their nationals from the Chinese, \nthe latter were forbidden by a special edict, \nissued by the Emperor Kienlung, to mi\xad\ngrate to Manchuria. Those, furthermore, \nwho had settled in the two northern prov\xad\ninces were excluded from that vast and \nremote part of the country. The imperial \nedict, however, did not kill the natural \ntendency of the Chinese to migrate to the \nnorth and the prohibitive measures of the \nManchu dynasty could not be carried out \nand proved to be of no avail.\nBut it was only in the last decade of \nthe century, when Russia started building \nacross Manchuria the Chinese Eastern Rail\xad\nway, that a regular process of colonization \nof Manchuria by Chinese on a big scale \nset in. From the following figures this \nremarkable growth of colonization, cover\xad\ning the period of the last thirty years or \nso, may be clearly seen: On the eve of\nthe twentieth century the population of the \ntwo northern provinces of Manchuria was \nonly about 1,500,000 (the population of \nSouthern Manchuria was at that time about\n3.000. 000.. In 1908 it increased to 5,700,- \n000, in 1919 to 9,000,000 and in 1926 to\n18.000. 000. The population of the whole \nof Manchuria amounts at present to\n22.000. 000. (Some estimates reach as high \nas 26,000,000.) Thus the population of \nManchuria in the last three decades in\xad\ncreased five times (from 4,500,000 to 22,- \n000,000), and that of her northern prov\xad\ninces taken alone about eight times and \na half (from 1,500,000 to 13,000,000).\nOnly an insignificant percentage of that \npopulation falls to the non-Cliinese ele\xad\nments, of which the Japanese, probably the \nlargest foreign element in Manchuria, \nhardly constitute nine-tenths of 1 per cent.\n669\n', "670 CURRENT HISTORY, FEBRUARY, 1928\n(under 200,000). The great mass of the \npopulation is formed by the Chinese, mostly \nimmigrants from Chihli and Shantung.\nAttraction of Chinese Labor\nChinese laborers are attracted to Man\xad\nchuria by the opportunities of finding work \nin various fields of local industry, such \nas lumbering, construction, manufacturing \nand mining, but their predominant number \nand constant flow to that country are \nchiefly due to the very favorable perspec\xad\ntives which Manchuria opens to the farmer. \nIts climate does not undergo sudden \nchanges, the soil of its plains is extremely \nrich, the slopes of its mountains, especially \nin the East, are suitable for cultivation. \nApplying their century-old methods of till\xad\ning the soil the persistent and laborious \nChinese colonists gradually turned north\xad\nern Manchuria, where not so long ago only \nhunting and cattle-breeding were possible, \ninto a cultivated land and made agriculture \nits basic industry. Acccording to the* lat\xad\nest available statistics (1922) northern \nManchuria alone yields annually about\n62,000,000 tons of agricultural products, of \nwhich about 25.6 per cent, goes for export. \nYet its farming* possibilities are far from \nbeing exhausted, as only 83 per cent, of \nthe whole area is under cultivation.\nNo little time will elapse before Manchu\xad\nria’s capacity as a reservoir for the sur\xad\nplus population of China will be filled up. \nAlthough its population has largely in\xad\ncreased of late, the average number of \ninhabitants to a square mile in the North \nhardly reaches the figure of 150, while the \ndensity of population in some of China’s \ncoastal provinces (Kiangsu, for instance) \namounts to 875 men to a square mile.\nSuch factors as the natural tendency of \nthe Chinese to migrate to the North and \nthe continuous and rapid growth of their \nnumbers in Manchuria, as well as the re\xad\nsults of their activity there, explain first, \nthe close economic relationship between the \nprovinces of northern China (Chihli, Shan\xad\ntung), on the one hand and Manchuria on \nthe other, and, secondly, the steady process \nunder which Manchuria is turning into a \npurely Chinese land, a land inhabited and \ntilled by the Chinese and depending on the \nwork of their great mass.\nChina’s attitude toward the problem of \nManchuria was made clear during the \nWashington Conference, one of the objects \nof which was the “consideration of all \nmatters bearing upon the situation of \n(Pacific and Far Fastern) problems with \na view to reaching a common understand\xad\ning with respect to principles and policies \nin the Far East.” In the course of the \ndiscussions of the three main questions \nraised by the Chinese delegation in con. \nnection with that problem (the presence \nof Japanese troops and police agencies in \nManchuria, the extended term of the Jap\xad\nanese leases of territory and railways in \nSouth Manchuria, the unilateral treaties \nof 1915 growing out of the Twenty-one \nDemands) a significant statement was \nmade by Dr. Wellington Koo, one of the \nspokesmen of the delegation. It was, in \npart, to the following effect:\nNot only does the national safety of China \ndepend upon the safeguarding of Manchuria \nas an integral portion of the Chinese Re\xad\npublic * * * but also the security of the \neconomic life of the Chinese people depends \nin a very vital measure on th.e conservation \nand development, by the surplus capital of \nthe world of the natural and agricultural \nresources in Manchuria—a region where \ntoday an abundance of raw material and \nfood supplies are already accessible to all \nnations. * * * Moreover, Manchuria is\nan important outlet for the surplus popula\xad\ntion from the congested provinces in other \nparts of China.\nThe words of the above official state\xad\nment show in the clearest way how great \nthe importance of Manchuria is for China \nas a nation.\nRussia’s Interest\nWhat are Russia’s interests in Manchu\xad\nria? To formulate a correct answer to this \nquestion is neither easy nor encouraging. \nIt is not easy, because the unfavorable im\xad\npression created by the Czarist Govern\xad\nment's imperialistic policy toward China \nwith respect to Manchuria still prevails, \ndespite the fact that that policy underwent \na fundamental change after the Russo- \nJapanese war. It is not encouraging be\xad\ncause, in view of the communistic propa\xad\nganda and activities in China of the Soviet \nGovernment, aiming at a “ world revolu\xad\ntion,” Russia’s legitimate interests may be \neasily identified with those of the Third \nInternational. Speaking, therefore, about \nRussia’s national interests in Manchuria \nis not unlike pleading in behalf of a lost \ncause. Nevertheless, the importance of the \nquestion justifies an attempt.\nThat Russia may look upon Manchuria \nas an outlet for her population, before \nwhich lies open an enormous colonization \nfund in the vast territories of Eastern as \nwell as Western Siberia, is a question \nwhich hardly deserves any consideration. \nNor is Russia in need of Manchuria’s agri\xad\ncultural products, the latter’s basic re-\n", 'RIVALRY OF RUSSIA, CHINA AND JAPAN IN MANCHURIA 671\nMap of Manchuria and adjoining territories\nsources, since the fertile regions of the\nTrans-Baikal and West Siberia, province®\nnot only fully meet the requirements of \nthe population of Siberia, but constitute an \nimportant part of Russia’s export. The \nsame holds true with regard to the prod\xad\nucts of the timber industry, which takes \nsecond place among North Manchuria’s \nitems of export. The mineral resources of \nManchuria are chiefly situated in the \nsouthern portion of that country and are \nexploited by the Japanese. Consequently, \nit is not in colonization, food supply or\nnatural resources; the need of which might \nexplain, if not justify, a policy of expan\xad\nsion, that Russia’s interests in Manchuria \nmust be looked for.\nTo find the explanation we must turn to \nRussia’s need of unimpeded access to the\nsea and to the problem of her communica\xad\ntions in the Far East. Tile fact that North\nManchuria is crossed from end to end by \na railway built by Russia with China’s con\xad\nsent and forming a vital link of the Great \nTrans-Siberian line, is the explanation of \nRussia’s national interest in Manchuria— \nan interest which, regardless of the kind \nof Government which happens to be for the \nmoment at the country’s helm, can not leave \nthe Russian nation indifferent to the status \nand eventual fate of Manchuria. The ques\xad\ntion, therefore, of the importance of Man\xad\nchuria to Russia may be narrowed down \nto the importance of the Chinese Eastern \nRailway. The latter forms the continua\xad\ntion in a straight line of the Great Trans- \nSiberian Railway and is the shortest way \nto Vladivostok. By building it across Man-\n', '672 CURRENT HISTORY, FEBRUARY, 1928\nchuria Russia was able to shorten the east\xad\nern section of the Great Trans-Siberian \nRailway, between Vladivostok in the east \nand the Trans-Baikal in the west, a dis\xad\ntance of 925 miles, by 400 miles. (The \nsouthern line of the Chinese Eastern Rail\xad\nway, Harbin-Dalni (Japanese Dairen), \nabout 625 miles long, was ceded to Japan \nby the Treaty of Portsmouth, with the \nexception of the section Harbin-Kuanchen- \ntze, about 150 miles. The Japanese por\xad\ntion, Kuanchentze (Changchun) - Dairen, \nabout 475 miles, with branches, is called \nnowr the South Manchuria Railway.)\nF a c t o r  i n  E c o n o m i c  D e v e l o p m e n t\nThe role of the Chinese Eastern Rail\xad\nway, as the shortest link between Russia \nand the Pacific Ocean and as a part of \nthe transit route across two continents, \nhardly needs to be emphasized. But that \nthe railway also became the fundamental \nfactor of the economic development of Man\xad\nchuria is a fact which has never been \nstressed enough. Yet it may be said that \nthe history of the Chinese Eastern Rail\xad\nway is the history of the economic devel\xad\nopment of Manchuria. The intensive col\xad\nonization of Manchux-ia, the bringing to\xad\ngether of the far-distant parts of that coun\xad\ntry, with an area of 365,000 square miles, \nlarger than that of the three Pacific States \nof the United States (Washington, Ore\xad\ngon and California) taken togethei’, the \nopening up of her natural resources, were \nthe direct results of the building of the \nrailway. I cite here a few facts and data:\nIn 1897, when the construction began, \nthere were in northern Manchuria only \nthree districts where colonization was under \nway, though it was developing very slowly. \nThey were: Tsitsikhar, Hulancheng and\nNinguta. The remaining immense stretch\no f  land ilrx-ough wHich the railw ay was to\npass was inhabited by nomadic, practi\xad\ncally independent tribes. The work of \nrailway construction attracted thousands \nof workers—Chinese coming from the \nSouth. After the Boxer rebellion, when \nthe Chinese Eastern was formally opened \nfor traffic (June, 1903), the Chinese \nadministration, having worked out a whole \nplan of systematic colonization of Manchu\xad\nria, carried it through step by step in a \ncomparatively short time. This, of course, \nwas possible by making use of the railway.\nTo what extent the Chinese Eastern Rail\xad\nway contributed to the opening of Manchu\xad\nria economically may be seen from the \nfollowing figures (taken from Northern \nManchuria and the Chinese Eastern Rail\xad\nway, Economic Bureau of the C. E. R., \nHarbin, 1922), showing the percentage of \nexport and import goods transported by \nthe railway in the period 1906-1921:\nExports. Imports.\n1906............................................... 12.8 30.8\n1913...............................................  47.6 23.2\n1916...............................................  30.4 15.1\n1920 .....................................  61.0 15.0\n1921 .....................................  63.6 16.9\n(Note—The balance is made up by local \ntransport and transit goods.]\nFrom the above figures it may be seen \nthat exports, or, in other words, products \nof Manchuria’s economic life, steadily in, \ncreased and in 1921 constituted more than \nthree-fifths of all goods transported by the \nrailway, while the imports were on the \ndecrease and in the last years formed only \none-fourth of the exports. This situation \ndeveloped in Manchuria contrary to the \nanticipations of the builders of the rail\xad\nway, who had undertaken its construction \nwith the expectation that the main func\xad\ntions o f the railway would be transporta\xad\ntion o f imports and transit goods.\nAn idea of the general progress of the \nChinese Eastern Railway’s work may be \nhad by taking note of the following figures: \nThe annual tonnage of goods carried over \nthat railway grew (in thousands o f tons) \nfrom 250 (1902) to 1,240 (1913), to 2,100 \n(1921) and to 2,800 (1923); in otheiwords,\nit increased in twenty-two yeai’s \nmore than ten times.\nThe Chinese Eastern Railway was a \ncostly undertaking for Russia. The funds \nspent for the construction of the railway \nreached the imposing sum of $200,000,000. \nThe present cost of the railway, by deduct\xad\ning from the above sum the cost of the \nsouthern line (ceded to Japan) and adding \nto it the expenditures on improvements, \nplus loans and deficits, is estimated at\n$ 600 ,00 0 ,000 . (IMtexhi<l,u /yictv’ocLri.(t-y<ju Z h A avt,\n1926, No. 10.)\nThe status of the Chinese Eastern Rail\xad\nway at present is determined by a treaty \nsigned in May, 1924, by the Chinese Gov\xad\nernment arid that of Soviet Russia. In \nview of the fact that Marshal Chang Tso- \nlin, the dictator of Manchuria, had refused \nto recognize that treaty, a supplementary \nagreement was concluded in September of \nthe same year, with Peking’s consent, be\xad\ntween the “ Autonomous Government of the \nThree Eastern Provinces” and the Soviet. \nIn virtue of that agreement the Chinese \nEastern Railway was to become an exclu\xad\nsively commercial undertaking, under joint \nmanagement and control of both China and \nRussia, and the fate of the railway in\n', 'RIVALRY OF RUSSIA, CHINA AND JAPAN IN MANCHURIA 673\nfuture was to depend only on what the \ntwo above Powers might jointly decide with \nregard to it.\nIt is not the purpose of this article to \npass upon that agreement, nor upon the \npresent status of the Chinese Eastern Rail\xad\nway, in the zone of which, owing to the \nconflicts and strained relations between \nChang Tso-lin and the Soviet authorities, \nthe situation is far from settled. But as \nsoon as conditions in China become normal \nand a Government comes into power in \nPeking which will be able to exercise con\xad\ntrol over Manchuria, the problem of the \nChinese Eastern Railway will no doubt be \ntaken up with a view to arriving at a final \nsolution. Whatever that solution may be, \none can easily foresee that, on Russia’s \npart, the following two conditions will form \nthe basis of any agreement: (1) That up\nto the time when the Chinese Eastern is \nredeemed, or becomes the property of China, \nRussia’s rights of ownership must be rec\xad\nognized, and, (2) That the railway, when \nit ceases to be Russia’s property, shall \nneither fall into the hands nor tinder the \ninfluence of a “ third Power.”\nJapan’s Interest\nThe vast importance attached to Man\xad\nchuria by Japan may be clearly seen from \nthe following quotations: “ Manchuria,”\nsaid the spokesman of the Japanese dele\xad\ngation at the Washington Conference, “ (is) \na region where, by reason of its close pro\xad\npinquity to Japan’s territory more than \nanything else, Japan has vital interests in \nall that relates to her economic life and \nnational safety.”  “ The question of war \nor peace for Japan,”  states a Japanese \nauthor in a book devoted to the descrip\xad\ntion of Manchuria (A. Kinnouske, Man\xad\nchuria, 1925), “ will be settled, not in Japan, \nnor on the Pacific, * * * but in Man\xad\nchuria. * * * Japan is about to find\nin Manchuria the source of life and national \npeace. For of all the thousand troubles \nJapan has, two are serious: The lack of \nfood and the lack of vital materials. * * * \nAnd Manchuria seems to be the answer to \na large extent.”  “ Especially in the Man\xad\nchurian region,”  said Premier Tanaka in \na recent address expressing his views on \nChina, “where we have the closest connec\xad\ntions, Japan cannot tolerate the spread \nof disorder.”\nThat the above statements are justified \nby facts and actual conditions the Japanese \nthemselves have been anxious to make clear \nin interviews, books and addresses. Learn\xad\ning what has been done by Japan in Man\xad\nchuria one realizes that great indeed are \nthe interests vested by her in that region \nand similarly great the advantages which \nshe draws or expects to draw from her \ninvestments.\nNo sooner was the Russo-Japanese war \nover than Japanese money began to flow \ninto Manchuria. To that end the South \nManchurian Railway Company, which took \nover the control of the Changchun-Dairen \nline, ceded to Japan under the Treaty of \nPortsmouth, was called into being by an \nImperial ordinance in 1906. The company \nwas capitalized first at 200,000,000 yen \n(about $100,000,000) and later its capital\xad\nization was increased to 440,000,000 yen \n(about $220,000,000), of which the Japa\xad\nnese Government’s holdings amounted to \n50 per cent. Though nominally a joint- \nstock company, the South Manchuria Rail\xad\nway Company is in fact under complete \ncontrol of the Imperial Government at \nTokio, which appoints its directors. The \nChief o f Staff of the Japanese armies in \nthe war of 1904-05 (General Kodama) was \nthe first director of the company. Later \non that post was held by a former Minister \nof War (General Terauchi). The South \nManchuria Railway Company is looked \nupon by the Japanese as an “ Empire \nbuilder”  and “ by far the biggest fairy \nmother of Japan’s activities in Manchuria.”\nUnder the aegis of the company the \nJapanese activities developed and grew rap\xad\nidly. First they were confined to South \nManchuria, including the Kwantung leased \nterritory, the lease on which was extended \nin 1915 to nine-nine years (up to 2002), \nbut subsequently they were carried over \nto the northern provinces of Manchuria. \nIt is estimated (New York Times, Aug. 18, \n1927) that the amount of 1,300,000,000 yen \nrepresents the approximate total invested\nin Manchuria by tho Japanese,\nJapanese Progress in  22 Y ears\nWhat are the results of those activities \nafter the twenty-two years which have \nelapsed since the Russo-Japanese war? \nJapan controls in Manchuria a modern \nsystem of railways, partly owned and leased \nby her and partly built with Japanese \nfunds, and consisting of lines leading to \nthe three principal ports of South Manchu\xad\nria (Dairen, Yingkow and Antung), and \nof a network of branches, of which two \nare of special significance. They are sec\xad\ntions of proposed lines, one of which will \neventually connect South Manchuria with \nEastern Mongolia (section Ssupinghai-Ta- \nonanfu) and another which will serve as\n', '674 CURRENT HISTORY, FEBRU ARY, 1928\nThe Pekin-Kalgan Railroad, built by American-trained Chinese engineers and largely with \nAmerican material. Chinese railroad history began in 1876, when the Woosung line, built by\nforeign enterprise, was opened\nan outlet for Manchuria on the Sea of \nJapan, at the port of Seishin (section \nChangchun-Kirin). The great economic as \n•well as strategic importance of those rail\xad\nways for Japan is obvious.\nThe city of Dairen has been turned into \na first-class port, with piers and quays \nmaking it possible to berth at one and the \nsame time steamships of a total tonnage \no f 170,000 tons, and is equipped with mod\xad\nern workshops and warehouses which can \nhouse half a million tons of goods. Stra\xad\ntegically it presents for Japan an excellent \nbase for action on the mainland.\nRail w a y  Company’s M ines\nThe Fushun coal mines, owned by the\nSouth Manchuria Railway Company— by\nfar the most important of all the coalfields \nin Manchuria—yield to Japan daily 17,000 \ntons. There are also five other coalfields \nexploited by the Japanese (among them the \nYentai mines with a daily output of 400 \ntons are the largest).\nOne-half of all the exports through the \nthree South Manchurian ports mentioned \nabove (five years ago the total value of \nthe exports through those ports was esti\xad\nmated at $172,000,000) consists of soya \nbeans, which are the leading agricultural \nproduct of Manchuria, not only used largely \nby the Japanese as food, fertilizer (bean \ncake) and raw material in many lines of \ni n d u s t r y  (b e a n  oil), but also constituting \nan international trade commodity. As re\xad\ngards imports, the Japanese share in the \nimportation of cotton pieces (cotton tex\xad\ntiles dominate the imports of Manchuria \njust as the soya beans dominate the ex\xad\nports) is twice as large as the share of all \nthe other countries taken together.\nThe net profit of the South Manchuria \nRailway Company, which, besides railways \nand coal mines, controls the Anshan mines \n(iron ore), big oil mills, huge generators of \nelectric power and many other enterprises, \namounted (in 1924) to 56,000,000 yen (about \n$23,000,000).\nThus it may be seen that Manchuria has \nbecome in fact a “ source of life” for Japan, \nnot only in the sense that she finds there \nan answer to her question of “ lack of food\nand vital materials,”  but also for the rea\xad\nson that Manchuria serves the Nippon \nEmpire, which above all is a country of \nindustrial producers, as an outlet for her \nindustries.\nIn one respect, however, Japan’s expec\xad\ntations with regard to Manchuria coulcl not \nbe realized and her aim proved to be a \ncomplete failure. These were her expecta\xad\ntions to find in Manchuria an outlet for \nthe surplus of her population, increasing \n800,000 yearly. This is a fact which is \nadmitted by the Japanese officials in Man\xad\nchuria themselves. During the last twenty \nyears, according to a statement by Baron \nOkura, director of the South Manchuria \nRailway, the increase of Japanese in Man\xad\nchuria consisted only of 10,000 and the\n', 'RIVALRY OF RUSSIA, CHINA AND JAPAN IN MANCHURIA 675\ntotal number of representatives of that \nnation in Manchuria did not even reach\n220,000, which is only about nine-tenths of \n1 per cent, o f the whole of its population. \nIn this respect a significant remark was \nadded by the Baron: “ One cannot com\xad\npete,”  he said, “with the Chinese coolies, \nwho poured into Manchuria in such vast \nnumbers that it became necessary to limit \nthe landings at Dairen to 12,000 daily.”  \nThus, despite the great effort made by \nJapan, Manchuria, which for centuries \nformed a part of the Chinese Empire de \njure, has become the land o f the Chinese \ncoolie de facto.\nBut if such is the fact, one feels entitled \nto put the question: Is Japan about to\nfind in Manchuria, in addition to the source \nof life, also a source of national peace? \nAn affirmative answer to that question, it \nseems, might be given only if  the follow\xad\ning conditions existed: (a) I f  the Chinese \nnation were reconciled to the fact that \nJapan is the master o f Manchuria; (b) \nIf Russia were indifferent to the Chinese \nEastern Railway’s fate; (c) I f Japan’s \nstrategic position in Manchuria were \nstronger than that of Russia and China, \ntaken together. But of these three condi\xad\ntions the first two, as set out above, do \nnot exist. Nor is the attitude of China \nand Russia with regard to Manchuria \nlikely to change in future,\nA dvantage B ased on  M ilitary F orce\nAs to the third condition, however, there \ncan be no question that it has been firmly \nestablished. Japan’s indisputable com\xad\nmand o f the Far Eastern seas, her excel\xad\nlent bases and double-tracked railways in \nManchuria, enabling her to concentrate \nquickly large forces south of Harbin and \neast of Peking, her general military pre\xad\nparedness, are advantages -which almost\nexclude any probability of successful resist\xad\nance to Japan’s will supported by military \nthreat or action. Perhaps no better char\xad\nacterization of Japan’s present strategic \nposition has been made than that contained \nin the following words written by M. J. \nSauerwein, Foreign Editor of Le Matin \n(New York Times, April 16, 1927), a \nrecent visitor to Manchuria: “ When con\xad\nsidering the possibility of a war in the \nFar East one thinks only of Japan. She \nis the only Power possessing the means \nto make such a war. It all depends on \nwhether she would find it vital to her \ninterest to take such a risk.”\nThus the national peace and security, \nof which Japan claims to have found a\nsource in Manchuria, appears to be based \nonly on one o f the three above conditions, \nthat is, on Japan’s military strength. \nWhether national peace based only on mili\xad\ntary strength may be considered as a peace \nof permanent nature and contributing to \ntlie improvement of international relations \nis a question which, to say the least, arouses \nmuch doubt. At any rate, the general \nopinion about Manchuria outside of Japan \nis far from being reassuring and the situ\xad\nation there is regarded as containing “ much \nlatent dynamite.”\nC a u s e s  o f  t h e  P r o b l e m\nOn the strength of all that has been set \nforth above, a definite conclusion with re\xad\ngard to the Manchurian problem may he \nreached. It is to the following effect:\nThe problem of Manchuria has not arisen \nout of temporary conditions and casual \ncircumstances. Its origin is due to factors \nwhich, having for their base irresistible \ntendencies of normally developing national \nlife, such as the tendency to migrate into \nregions offering better living conditions \n(in China’s case), or to get over economic \ndifficulties, either in the question of unim\xad\npeded communications with the seacoast (in \nRussia’s case), or in that of supply with \nvital resources and of securing outlets for \nindustrial products (in Japan’s case), are \nworking continuously, and, as history \nteaches, can not be eliminated by imposing \ninjunctions or placing obstacles in their \nway.\nThe solution o f the problem, therefore, \nappears to lie in the creation of such con\xad\nditions in Manchuria as would enable the \ndevelopment of the vital interests of the \nnations concerned to combine without det\xad\nriment to any of them. Such conditions, \nit is obvious, can not be created by mere\napplication of forco, Tlioy itiuak be attained\nby  establishing a  modus Vivendi, the basic \npoints o f  which stand out clearly. They \nare as follow s:\n(1) The recognition o f China’s sover\xad\neignty over Manchuria; (2) The solution \nof the fate of the Chinese Eastern Railway \nin accordance with the interests of Russia \nas a nation, which sooner or later is bound \nto come back to the family of nations; (3) \nIn future no railway construction in Man\xad\nchuria should be undertaken, the main pur\xad\npose of which is to serve the interests of \na foreign country, or, in other words, the \nprinciple should be recognized that the rail\xad\nways in Manchuria must be neither Rus\xad\nsian nor Japanese nor of any other nation, \nbut Chinese.\n']</pre>
