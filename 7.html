No citizen, man or woman,\nworker of employer, can fairly\nanswer the question, "What has\nthe special session of Congress\ndone for me?" without a sense\nof regret at having voted last\nautumn to supplant the Demo\ncratic majority. More than two\nmonths have elapsed since Pres\nident Wilson recommended to\nthe special session the passage\nof certain statutes which were\nintended and required to curb\nprofiteering, to reduce or at\nleast to stabilize the cost of liv\ning, and to restore business to\nthe normal status of peace. Not\none of the President\'s recom\nmendations has beocme law;\nno substantial progress has been\nmade toward their serious con\nsideration. In the House of Representa\ntives -the Republican majority\ni3 a composite of factions which\nare a unite upon only one poli\ncythat of opposing the Pres\nident. In every question of con\nstructive legislation they are an\nincoherent aggregation of ca\nbals and coteries, unable and un\nwilling to co-operate either with\nPresident Wilson or their own\npunative leaders. Thd Senate\'s\nrecord of inaction and recalcit\nranee is known to all the, world.\nIt has become notorious, under\nits reactionary Republican con\ntrol, not for what it has done,\nright or wrong, but for all that\n.vit has refused to do.

The primary object of the cam\npatgn, which will be known as the\nThird Red Cross Roll Call, will be\nto enroll members for 1920. Twenty\nmillion members will be sought\nthroughout th country, and in the\nSouthwestern Division of the Rd\nCross, comprising the states of Mis\nsouri, Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma . .d\nArkansas, the quota has been set at\n2,000.000 members.\nIt is the- consensus of opinion that\nthe coming drive Is the most important\never undertaken by the Red Cross, in\nasmuch at the results will determine\nto a large extent the possibilities ot\nfuture Red Cross endeavor.i.\nIs there an unspoken question in\nyour mind as to why the Red Cross\nIs conducting a drive? If so, perhaps\ntbe following brief outline -ill answer\nyour query:\nTbe Red Cross, first of all, must\ntake rare of the wounded and disabled\nsoldiers In the hospitals. Thousands\nof men are still in the hospitals\nabroad In the Army r -cupation, Ir\nthe camps awaiting discharge and In\nt-ervlce on the border. The Ked Cron\nr.ust continue to care for these men\nLntil the last man is home.\nTbe safety of Ann \' i hinges on the\nchecking of disease and Bolshevism;\nabroad.

Tbe toll of\nthe lnfluenta epidemic, tbe health con\nditlons revealed by the. draft, alarm\nlug statistics concerning iftiant mortal\nity, have added to the growing reali\nzatlou that public welfare depends\non public health.

California, particularly\nth delightful city of Los Angeles, went\nwild in its enthusiasm tor him and his\nadvocacy of the League, and it was\nIn that stute, perhaps, that he did his\nmost successful missionary work.\nHiram Johnson, California\'s furrier\ngovernor, now her United States sena\ntor, and considered by her as the most\nlikely Republican candidate tor the\npresidency In 1920, had before the ar\nrival of President Wilson, convinced\na great number of citizens that the\nLeague as at present formulated was\nnot a good thing. He had told them\nthat the Uulted States, because of It,\nwould be drawn Into every petty\nEuropean quarrel; he argued that we\nwould lose our sovereignty by joining\nwith the European nations. He had\nblamed the president for assenting to\nthe possession by Japan of the Penin\nsula of Shan Tung In China.\nExperience Gained by America and\nBritain In Great War to Be of -Lasting\nBenefit.\nBUREAU CHANGES NAME\nThe Mount Clemens News\nBureau, which has been furnishing\nreports on President Wilson\'s tour\nIn behalf of the League of Nations\nto 5,61)0 papers, has adopted a new\nname and will hereatter be known\nas The Independent News Bureau.\nBut Mr. Wilson, w!th clear logic and\nwith compelling eloquence, answered\nto the entire satisfaction of Calttor-\nilia\'s people every .objection which\nSenator Johnson had made to the\nLeague. And thousands of the state\'s\ncitizens deserted the Johnson stand\nard Immediately and rallied to the sup\nport of the president. More than that,\nthey came forward and said, "We\nwere against you, Mr. President, but\nyou have cleared everything up and\ncow we are with you heart and soul."\nStill more than that, they let Senator\nJohnson know that they were no\nlonger with him and that they disap\nproved of the speaking tour which he\nhimself was making In opposition to\nthe League uud so powerful was the\nvolume of public opinion which reach\nid him, that the senator almost Im\nmediately abandoned his tour. The\nShan Tung question, because of the\nintt-Japaneo feeling which undoubted\nly exists along the Pacific coast was\nthe most serious which the president\nhad to answer. H explained to the\npeople that he had been powerless to\nprevent the rich peninsula from being\ngiven to Japan. England and France,\nthrough a secret treaty, had promised\nIt to Japan for entering the war and\nremaining in It. That treaty had to\nbe carried out. Anyway It was not\nChina that was losing Shan Tung, but\nGermany, which had seized the terrl\ntory from China lu 1898 and held It\never since. Japan had promised, the\npresident explained, to return Shan\nTung as soon as the peace treaty was\nratified and It was only through the\nratification of the treaty with the\nLeague of Nations Inclusion, that\nChina could ever expect to get her\nformer property back. And she surely\nwould Ktt It back, he declared, through\nthe ratification of the League. There\nfore, through the same Instrumentality\nno other nation could again prey upon\nthe "Great, putient, diligent, but help\nless kingdom." As to our being drawn\nInto any European conflict. The pres\nident pointed out that no direct action\ntueu a-i the sending of troops to any\npart of the world to maintain or re\nktore order could be taken by the\nCouncil of the League without a unani\nmous vote of the council members\ntherefore our Tote could at once nega\ntlve any such proposition as sending\nour soldiers where we did not want\nthem seut. Besides, Mr. Wilson argued,\n"If you have to quench a fire In Call\nfurnla you don\'t send for the fire de\npartment of Utah." But, he argued.\nthere probably never will be another\nwar, It the League is established, for\nthe members promise either to arm\ntrate their difference and accept the\ndecision of the arbitrator, lay the dlf\nfereucea for discussion and publica\ntion before the Council of the League\nfor a, period of six months, and then,\nif possible, accept the council s advice\nThat failing, they agree to refrain from\nwar for a further period of threfe\nmonths and nine months of "cooling\noff," the president contended, would\nprevent any ai med conflict. These clear\nexplanation satisfied every reasonable\nUtuter and destroyed the "Bugaboos"\nwhich Senator Johnson and othtrhad\nraised against the League. Through\nrugged XevaV..! into Utah, the land of\nMormons, the president swept to find\nthat those line people were heartily\nitb him tor the League and a per\nmanency of H\'tace.\nIt is a good thing for those Ameri\ncans who think their country Is a hard\ntaskmaster in requesting economy,\nsaving and adherence to the many\nrules and regulations made necessary\nto any nation that has been at war,\nto note that the government of the\nUnited States is not the only govern\nmen which Is advising its people to\nlive well, work well and save well.\nOur ally across the sea Englund\nla urlng the unit, of her people In\nthrift and saving, to keep the Industry\nof that country from declining, which\nwould mean disaster and - longer\nperiod of reconstruction.\nIn a memorable speech made by\nKing George, not long since, in Lon\ndon, he said:\nWith \'he end of the war a great\nchapter in the history of our country\nis closed. A new era which is open\ning before up brings its own tasks,\nand the same qualities which have\ncarried us to victory will be needed\nin full measure for the work cf re\nconstruction. The spirit of union, self-\nsaeriflclng and patience which our peo\nple displayed during years of fighting,\nwill still be required If we are to reap\nthe full benefit of the peace which we\nhave won. And those great qualities\nmust be reinforced by the houilier vir\ntues of industry and thrift.\n"As was inevitable In the prosecu\ntion of the war, we have been losing\nlargely on our capital. Now that we\nare at peace again our country urgent\nly demands from every citizen the ut\nmost economy in order to make the\nbest use of the resources which our\nnation possesses, and strenuous and\nunremitting industry In order to In\nsure the greatest possible production\nof the necessary commodities. Without\nthese we cannot hope to maintain the\nhigh position in the industrial and\ncommercial world, which we held be\nfore the war.

It has been our experi\nence that it is seldom necessary to remove the tonsils to\nobtain complete relief.\nThis method of treatment relieves catarrh of the\nnose and throat and renders the mucous membrane much\nmore resistant to infection.
