        <pre>['THE FIRST "SECOND FRONT"\nBy SIDNEY B. FAY\nProfessor of History, Harvard University and Radcliffe College\nOn the night of November 7, just \neleven months after Pearl Harbor, \nthe world was electrified by Presi\xad\ndent Roosevelt’s announcement that \na “powerful American force,” under \nthe command of Lieutenant General \nDwight D. Eisenhower, was landing \non the Mediterranean and Atlantic \ncoasts of French North Africa.\nThe expedition was the largest \nsingle amphibious armada in history. \nIt comprised more than 500 troop \nand supply ships and a vast Anglo- \nAmerican protecting force of more \nthan 350 warships of all kinds, in\xad\ncluding aircraft carriers, battleships, \ncruisers, destroyers and submarines. \nDivided into two convoys, it then es\xad\ntablished beach-head landings at a \ndozen points in French Morocco and \nAlgeria, and quickly secured posses\xad\nsion of five airfields and all the im\xad\nportant ports and naval bases.\nBy 7 a . m . on November 11 \n(Armistice Day), only 76 hours after \nthe first landings, the Commuiider- \nin-Chief of all the Vichy-French \nforces, Admiral Darlan, was being \n“entertained by American officers \nin Algiers” and ordered all French \nopposition in Africa to cease. Gen\xad\neral Eisenhower could announce that \nthe fighting in Morocco and Algeria \nwas at an end. The French North \nAfrican Empire, safe in American \nhands, would be preserved for re\xad\nturn to France and would not fall \nunder the Axis heel. The vast under\xad\ntaking had resulted in an amazingly \nquick success. Roosevelt and Church\xad\nill had beaten Hitler and Mussolini \nto it.\nThis Anglo-American occupation \nof French North Africa was beauti\xad\nfully timed to coincide with the \nBritish Eighth Army’s precipitous\nexpulsion of Marshal Erwin Rom\xad\nmel’s Afrika Corps from Egypt, a \nthousand miles to the East. His \nrouted army was in danger of being \ngripped by powerful Anglo-Amer\xad\nican pincers—if he did not get timely \nreinforcements and if the Americans \ncould push by the Axis troops in \nFrench Tunisia and Italian Tripoli.\nThe establishment of this new \nUnited Nations Mediterranean front \nwas not exactly the kind of second \nfront for which the hard-pressed \nRussians and so many others had \nbeen hoping, because it did not mean \nthe instant invasion of German-held \nsoil and the instant recall of Ger\xad\nman troops from the Russian front \nfor defense against attacks nearer \nhome. But the new American Front \nwas nevertheless a real second front, \nbecause it laid the foundation for a \nlater but not far distant invasion of \nthe Axis territories, which would \neventually cause the Germans to re\xad\ncall a good part of their forces from \nStalingrad and the Caucasus.\nWhy the decision was made for a \nMediterranean front, and how the de\xad\ntails were secretly and successfully \nworked out was promptly revealed by \nits two chief authors.\n“The President of the United \nStates is the author of this mighty \nundertaking, and in all of it I have \nbeen his active and ardent lieutenant,” \nPrime Minister Churchill generous\xad\nly declared at a jubilant Mansion \nHouse dinner in London on Novem\xad\nber 10. Next day he stirred the \nHouse of Commons with a thrilling \nreview in greater detail. Simulta\xad\nneously in Washington at a press \nconference, President Roosevelt more \nfully told the “now it can be told” \nstory.\n', 'THE FIRST "SECOND FRONT\' 289\nA couple of weeks after Pearl \nHarbor the President invited Church\xad\nill and his staff to visit Washington \nfor a Christmas conference. The time \nhad come for joint planning by the \ntwo countries that had the greatest \ncombination of military and naval \nforces. The leaders of the two nations \nthen discussed the desirability of \noffensive action. They considered \nvarious possibilities, especially a \nlarge offensive action across the \nEnglish Channel. It was considered \nin the light of the problems involved \n—sufficiency of munitions and sup\xad\nplies, particularly airplanes, to make \nthe operation reasonably sure of suc\xad\ncess and the shipping of war sup\xad\nplies to Europe in time.\nThe military opinion was that the \nproposal was feasible, and a good \ndeal of work toward this end was \ndone. But the more it was studied, \nthe more apparent it became that, \nbecause of physical limitations (pro\xad\nduction of munitions, the training of \nenough men, and adequate shipping \ntransportation across the Atlantic) \nan attack across the Channel could \nnot he carried out in 1942.\nThe transportation problem was \nparticularly serious. During the \nspring months the German sub\xad\nmarines were carrying out increas\xad\ningly destructive attacks on unpro\xad\ntected shipping routes along the At\xad\nlantic seaboard of the United States \nand in the Caribbean. This caused a \nvery dangerous rise in merchant \nshipping losses, notably of oil tank\xad\ners, which reached a peak figure in \nthis area alone of nearly 600,000 \ngross tons in June. Total United \nNations shipping losses all over the \nseven seas amounted to nearly 900,- \n000 gross tons in June. Ships were \nbeing sunk much faster than they \ncould be replaced by new construc\xad\ntion. But by August new construc\xad\ntion of Liberty ships and other \nmerchant vessels had rapidly in\xad\ncreased, and more effective measures \nwere successfully taken to check the \nsubmarine menace. For the month of \nSeptember the sharply rising curve \nof total United Nations new con\xad\nstruction of merchant shipping— \nnearly 1,000,000 gross tons—was \nsafely above the then descending \ncurve of total losses—about 300,000 \ngross tons.\nIn view of the physical limitations, \nthe President asked Churchill to re\xad\nturn to Washington at the end of \nMay or the beginning of June to con\xad\nsider whether there should be a\nIllingworth in The London Daily Mail\n“T h e  D esert S ong”\n', '290 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1942\nlarge-scale offensive, which would be \nnecessary if an attack were to be \nmade across the Channel some time \nabout the middle of 1943, or whether \nit would be wiser to start in 1942 \nan offensive on a smaller scale, in \nwhich the problems of production, \ntraining and transportation would \nnot be so great.\nThe President and Churchill, aid\xad\ned by the combined Chiefs of Staff, \nsurveyed the possibility of an offen\xad\nsive more limited in scope. By the \nend of June agreement was reached \nin favor of an African offensive. By \nthe end of July, certain fundamentals, \nsuch as the points of attack, the num\xad\nbers of men required, and shipping \nfacilities, had been determined upon. \nThe preparations were secretly and \nrapidly pushed forward.\nWhile plans for the great armada \nwere being laid behind closed doors \nin London and Washington, an in\xad\nvaluable American agent, Robert D. \nMurphy, formerly consul at the Em\xad\nbassy in Paris, was working with \nsome two score under-cover men in \nAlgeria and Morocco, distributing \nfood and other supplies, making \nfriends, and obtaining exact informa\xad\ntion about local conditions. Similarly \nMajor General Mark Clark, with a \nfew officers in civilian clothes, estab\xad\nlished friendly contact with many \nFrench colonial army officers. These \nAmericans were beating the Ger\xad\nmans at the "tourist” game, and \nmaking pretty sure that an Amer\xad\nican Expeditionary Force on behalf \nof French freedom would probably \nnot meet with any serious local op\xad\nposition.\nMeanwhile in June, in addition \nto the shipping losses noted above, \ntwo ominous pieces of news arrived \nin Washington. The Germans had \nbegun their second great drive \nagainst Russia. It aimed to encircle \nMoscow, capture the Soviet capital \nfrom the rear, and cut it off from\nsending reinforcements for the de\xad\nfense of the Caucasus and the Bake \noil fields. It appeared to be one arm \nof a gigantic German pincers move\xad\nment to crush the whole United Na\xad\ntions position in the Middle East, the \nother arm being Rommel’s simul\xad\ntaneous drive against Egypt. This \ndrive brought the Afrika Corps to \nwithin 75 miles of Alexandria at El \nAlamein and resulted in the costly \nsurrender of 30,000 British at To\xad\nbruk.\nHITLER\'S FAILURE\nIn June no one could foresee \nthat Hitler’s aim in Russia was \ndoomed to failure—that he could not \nencircle Moscow, and that his Ger\xad\nmans, Italians, Hungarians, Ruma\xad\nnians and Slovaks would be even\xad\ntually stalled at Stalingrad and in \nthe Caucasus foothills 300 miles \nshort of Baku. But in view of the \ngreat strength of the German attack, \nStalin naturally wanted a second \nfront on the English Channel that \nwould reduce the pressure on his own \nforces.\nSince this second front was deem\xad\ned impracticable for 1942, Churchill \ndid the next three best things that he \ncould for Stalin. British forces in \nEgypt had already been diverted in \npart to the Middle East in case the \nGermans should strike at the Cau\xad\ncasus. The Churchill-Roosevelt June \ncommunique on the “agreement of \nthe urgency of a second front” \nserved to worry the Germans and \nforce them to leave 33 divisions and \na third of their bombers in the West. \nAnd Churchill himself decided to go \nto Moscow and explain fully and \nfrankly to Stalin the whole secret \nAnglo-American strategy.\nThis visit in August did a great deal \nto prevent possible friction between \nthe Anglo-Saxon powers and their \nRussian allies, as is evident from \nStalin’s masterly and understanding\n', 'THE FIRST “SECOND FRONT" 291\nspeech of November 6. Churchill \nalso assured the House of Commons \nwhen he said: “I have a solid belief \nin the wisdom and good faith of this \noutstanding man [Stalin], and al\xad\nthough the news that I brought was \nnot welcome and not considered ade\xad\nquate, nevertheless the fact remains \nthat we parted good friends. The \nRussians bore their disappointment \nlike men. They faced the enemy, and \nnow they have reached winter suc\xad\ncessfully, although we were unable \nto give them the help they so earnest\xad\nly demanded, and, had it been physi\xad\ncally practicable, we would have so \ngladly afforded.”\nIncidentally, it may be noted that, \nalthough Roosevelt and Churchill \nhad been unable to open a Channel \nsecond front in the summer of 1942, \nthey did send Russia large supplies. \nIn the twelve months ending in \nOctober, 1942, they had sent to Rus\xad\nsia vast quantities of supplies, in\xad\ncluding 3,052 planes, 4,048 tanks, \n30,031 vehicles and 831,000 tons of \nmiscellaneous shipments of shells, \nmachines, machine tools, foodstuffs, \nmedicines and metals. All this did \nnot reach Russia, because some of it \nwas sent to the bottom by German \nplanes and submarines which attack\xad\ned convoys on the way to Murmansk.\nSERIOUS EGYPTIAN SITUATION\nAs part of his trip to Moscow in \nlate August Churchill visited Eg^pt. \nHere the situation had been serious. \nIn the spring of 1942 Rommel had \nreceived large reinforcements and \nnew equipment for the pincers drive \nthat he hoped would carry him \nthrough Egypt to the Middle East \nwhen the Germans had taken Mos\xad\ncow and would be advancing to the \nBaku oil fields. This was the moment \nwhen British troops had been sent \nfrom Egypt to reinforce the Middle \nEast.\nWith a genius for desert warfare,\nMessner in The Rochester Timcs-Unum \nW orking  on a  N ew  S et\nwhere tanks can sail over great \nareas of sand like ships over the sea, \nRommel swept 400 miles eastward \nover Libya into Egypt. On June 21 \nhe captured the important port of \nTobruk and took 30,000 British pris\xad\noners there. His new 88-millimeter \nguns, far superior to the British 25- \npounders, knocked out the British \nand American tanks.\nGeneral Auchinlcck then prudently \nwithdrew the battered British Eighth \nArmy further eastward to El Ala- \nmein. Here he was able to make a \nfirm stand because the desert nar\xad\nrows to a passage only 30 miles wide. \nIt was a short front which he had \nenough troops to defend. Rommel \ncould no longer make his wide sweep\xad\ning tank attacks, because the Brit\xad\nish right on the El Alamein line was \nprotected by the Mediterranean, and \nthe left flank by the swampy and im\xad\npassable Qatarra Depression. Here \nthe British were standing firm, but \nonly 75 miles from Alexandria and \nliable to a new attack by Rommel, \nwhen Churchill arrived.\nHow this British Eighth Army re\xad\nceived new and better tanks to be \nused in a counter-offensive against\n', "292 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1942\nRommel was revealed by Churchill \non November 11: “On the dark day \nwhen the news of the fall of Tobruk \ncame in, I  was with President Roose\xad\nvelt in his room at the White House. \nThe House of Commons knows how \nbitter a blow this was, but nothing \ncould have exceeded the delicacy and \nkindness of our American friends. \nThey had no thought but to help. \nTheir very best tanks [the 32-ton \nGeneral Shermans with 75-millimeter \nturret guns which could shoot in \nany direction] were just coming out \nof the factories. The first batch of \nthem had been newly placed in the \nhands of their divisions who had been \nwaiting for them. The President took \na large number of these tanks back \nfrom the troops to whom they had \njust been given. They were placed \non board ship in the early days of \nJuly and they sailed direct to Suez \nunder American escort. The Presi\xad\ndent also sent us a large number of \nself-propelled 105-millimeter guns \nwhich are most useful weapons for \ncontending with the 88-millimeter \nhigh velocity guns of which the Ger\xad\nmans have made so much use. One \nship of this precious convoy was \nsunk by a U-boat. Immediately, with\xad\nout being asked, the United States \nreplaced it with another ship carry\xad\ning an equal number of both \nweapons.”\nChurchill believed that the morale \nof the British Eighth Army would \nbe improved by a change of com\xad\nmanders. In place of General Claude \nAuchinleck he appointed General \nHarold R. L. G. Alexander as Com\xad\nmander in Chief of the British forces \nin the entire Middle East, and \nLieutenant General Bernard L. \nMontgomery as field commander of \nthe Eighth Army. Alexander had \ndistinguished himself at Dunkirk, in \nBurma and elsewhere. Montgomery, \naffectionately known to his men as \n“Monty,” was 54 years old, an Ulster\xad\nman and the son of the Bishop of \nTasmania, a teetotaler and a non- \nsmoker. He had iron nerves, absolute \ncalmness and self-control, and had \nthe reputation of riding in front line \ntanks to see for himself exactly what \nthe situation was at critical points.\nBefore leaving Egypt, Churchill \nspent a night with the troops in the \ndesert. He left them with the direc\xad\ntive that their prime duty was to take \nor destroy Rommel’s army, together \nwith all his supplies and establish\xad\nments in Egypt and Libya.\nMONTGOMERY'S OFFENSIVE\nOn the night of October 23, with \nbagpipes playing, General Mont\xad\ngomery started his carefully planned \noffensive. His men first had to creep \nforward pushing little machines \nalong the ground, as one would push \na lawn-mower; a magnet sounded a \nbuzz in the earphone when it passed \nover the mines that Rommel had \nburied all along his front to blow up \nenemy tanks. When mines were \nfound, they were dug out of the sand, \nthe fuses were removed, and they \nwere carried to the rear, three or \nfour by a single soldier. Lighted \ntorches or red tape then marked for \nthe British tanks the safe passages \ncleared of mines.\nThen the British infantry attacked, \ncutting barbed wire and seizing the \nenemy’s front-line positions by hand- \nto-hand fighting. At the same time \nthey were protected by a heavy bar\xad\nrage fire from the British guns in \nthe rear. The infantry thus opened \nthe way for the tanks, instead of \ntanks opening the way for the in\xad\nfantry as in most battles of the Sec\xad\nond World War up to this time. After \nseveral days of this slow progress, \nthe British tanks finally crashed \nthrough the middle of the El Alamein \nline. A couple of thousand Germans \nwere cut off near the Mediterranean. \nThree Italian divisions were cut off\n", 'THE FIRST \'SECOND FRONT’ 293\nnear the Qatarra Depression. They \nwere left deserted by the Germans \nand were rounded up later by the \nBritish.\nRommel was forced to a rapid re\xad\ntreat which gradually became a rout. \nHis fleeing trucks and guns were \nmercilessly pounded by British and \nAmerican planes which enjoyed a \ndecided air superiority. It was like \nthe situation before Dunkirk, except \nthat now it was the Germans who \nwere in retreat and were being \nbombed from the air. Bombers also \ndestroyed the supplies at his rear.\nBy November 13 Rommel’s bat\xad\ntered army, or what was left of it, \nhad been driven out of Egypt through \nthe half-blocked "Hellfire Pass" be\xad\ntween Egypt and Libya. It was ap\xad\nparently trying to escape across the \nLibyan Desert, either to make a \nstand at El Agheila, south of Ben- \ngazi, where there is a narrow pas\xad\nsage favorable for defense, or to es\xad\ncape to Italian bases in Tripoli. \nMeanwhile, American troops were \nadvancing toward Tunis in a pincers \nmovement aimed at closing in on the \nTunisian capital from the west.\nRommel had already lost Tobruk \nand was destroying stores in other \nports to prevent them from falling \ninto British hands. Of his army, \nwhich had consisted of 4 German \nand 7 Italian divisions, he had lost \n59,000 men killed or taken prisoner \nby the British, 500 tanks and 1,000 \nguns. The British losses were only \n13,600 men. President Roosevelt’s \nwisdom in sending the needed tanks \nand guns to the Eighth Army was \nnow clear.\nROMMEL\'S DEFEAT\nEgypt was henceforth free from \ndanger. Though Rommel’s force was \nrouted, it was not yet annihilated. It \nmight have considerable reserves, \nand Hitler might try to send it re\xad\ninforcements. Whether Rommel’s\nFitzpatrick in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nB ack to t h e  V aterland\nand the other Axis forces would be to\xad\ntally eliminated from North Africa \nwould depend on whether the armies \nof the United Nations could occupy \nTunisia. If they succeeded in doing \nso, they would acquire thirteen valu\xad\nable airfields and the strong naval \nbase of Bizerta. With these in their \nhands, their land-based planes could \nprotect United Nations shipping in \nthe Mediterranean. The transporta\xad\ntion difficulty would be greatly eased, \nbecause the route from New York to \nEgypt via the Mediterranean is less \nthan half as long as the route around \nSouth Africa. Bombers based on the \nNorth African coast could also easily \nstrike at Axis troops in southern \nFrance, Italy and the Balkans, and \n“soften up” these regions preparatory \nto establishing a real second front in \nEurope itself.\nThe meticulous care with which \nthe great Anglo-American armada \nwas prepared was rewarded by the \nsuccess with which landings were \nmade and the small extent of the \nopposition encountered. It was wise \nthat the first occupation troops were\n', '294 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1942\nAmericans instead of British. Some \nFrench army officers and most \nFrench naval officers disliked the \nBritish because of the long rivalry \nbetween the two empires, because of \nFrench suspicions of British impe\xad\nrialism, and because of the British \nattacks on Dakar and Oran in 1940. \nThe Americans, on the other hand, \never since the days of Lafayette had \nbeen the friends of the French. We \nhad aided them in the First World \nWar. We were not suspected of hav\xad\ning any imperialist aims in Europe.\nOn the Atlantic coast of Morocco \nAmerican troops under the imme\xad\ndiate command of Major General \nGeorge S. Patton made landings at \nAgadir south of the High Atlas, at \nSafi, which is connected through Mar\xad\nrakesh with the whole North Afri\xad\ncan railway system, and further \nnorth on the beaches on both sides \nof Casablanca and likewise at Rabat. \nBoth these important ports are on \nthe railway that runs 1,300 miles \nnorth to Tangier and east through \nAlgeria to Tunisia. West of Fez \nthe line is electrified because of lack \nof suitable water and coal for the \nlocomotives, but east of Fez coal is \nthe fuel, and it is a sign of the care\xad\nfulness of the invasion plans that\nTHE BATTLE OF\nI n  the weeks before the announce\xad\nment of the opening of the new Med\xad\niterranean front, American eyes \neagerly watched a hitherto little \nknown island in the Southwestern \nPacific. And when the Americans in \nNorth Africa first came to grips with \nthe Germans, the interest remained \nas intense as ever. On Guadalcanal \nIsland, in the seas around it, and in \nthe air above is being fought a bat\xad\ntle upon the outcome of which may \ndepend the future course of the \nPacific War. The island lies at the\nBritish coaling vessels were at once \non hand with the necessary fuel for \nthe locomotives.\nAt Casablanca a number of French \nnaval units put up a stiff fight, but \nthe chief vessel, the battleship \nJean Bart, was soon seen to be \nburning. American tanks and in\xad\nfantry were quickly able to force \ntheir way into the city from the al\xad\nready established beach-heads.\nOn the Mediterranean shore of \nAlgeria American troops under the \nimmediate command of Major Gen\xad\neral Lloyd R. Fredenhall landed to \nthe east and west of Oran and then \nclosed in on the city from the land \nside and forced it to surrender. They \nalso occupied three valuable airfields \nnearby and the naval base at Mres- \nel-Kebir. Much the same procedure \nwas followed at Algiers further east. \nHere, by luck or by design, Admiral \nDarlan was taken prisoner. Within \n76 hours after the first landings he \nsigned an armistice with General \nEisenhower and this virtually put an \nend to all further active resistance. \nThen began the advance of the \nAmericans from the west and of the \nBritish Eighth Army from the east \nto occupy Tunisia and drive the last \nAxis forces out of North Africa.\nTHE SOLOMONS\nsoutheastern end of the Solomons \nwhich stretch from the Japanese base \nat Rabaul toward the United Nations \noutposts in New Caledonia, the New \nHebrides and the Fiji Islands.\nIf Japan should take Guadalcanal \nand the nearby harbor at Tulagi, \nshe would be in possession of an \nexcellent air and sea base 5S4 air\xad\nline miles north of our nearest ad\xad\nvanced base in the New Hebrides. \nFrom there her planes and ships \ncould prey upon the Allied supply \nline to Australia.
