With her are a gun and\nFanning’s freshly shot body. Neill\nhides her nearby in a disused\nliner, then joins Mark Bonniger,\nkeen local investigator, to keep\ntab on developments. Re thinks\nJanet shot the swindler until he\nlearns a man was hiding on the\nyacht. Then he suspects queer lit\ntle Eyster, who hated Fanning.\nAlso in the picture are Kettering,\na Baltimore lawyer down to fish,\nand Ira Buckless, a tough who\ntrails Neill. A fisherman finds\nSSOO of Fanning’s money that\nNeill threw away in anger.\nChapter 28\nSearching The Ship*\n“\\IfELL,” continued Bonniger,\n’ * “upon the supposition that the\npacket was thrown or dropped in\nthe river last night, I started figur\ning the time of the tide and the\nrate of flow. And my calculations\nsuggest that it had made a trip\ndown the river and was on the way\nback again. If I am right, the fugi\ntives are still in the neighborhood\nand they dropped this packet in\nthe river at a point some distance\nnorth of where it was found. Well,\nwhat’s up there? Nothing but the\nabandoned ships. I’m getting ready\nto search them.” * , | ’\nNeill felt as if all the ground had\nsuddenly been cut from under his\nfeet. He had to say something, and\nquickly. ‘That’s a job!”\n“You’re right. That’s what I have\nbrought in tne p< lice for. I’m going\nto take half a dozen of the steadiest\nNo cupboard or corner escaped attention.\nmen in the village also. Kettering\nwill be with us. And I’m counting\non you, of course."\nNeill could not refuse to go. He\ndrew a long breath to steady his\nvoice. “It will soon be dark. You\nshould wait until morning."\n“It’s dark anyhow inside the\nships. We can search them as well\nby night as by day.”\nNeill could say nothing more.\nBonniger arranged to have his\nparty of 16 men carried up the road\nin three cars at intervals of five\nminutes in order not to attract too\nmuch attention in the village. Bon*\nniger himself and Neill went in the\nfirst car. Neill, taken by surprise\nand having no time to plan any\nthing, rode like a man who had re\nceived a blow 6n the head.\nAll my own fault, he thought. If\nI had not pitched that money over\nboard. Janet would still taupafe.\nThe Skiff Gone. Te 6\nCAPTAIN BICKKL, sfco had\nbeen notified by telephone of\ntheir coming, was waiting on the*\nshore. He Sam. I borrowed an ad\nditional skiff from the farmer up\nthe beach to savi\' time.* -rr \' •\nThis was another setback for\nNeill. If he was able to separate\nhimself from the party, he counted\non using that skiff himself.\nBonmger and Neill were rowed\nto the Montpelier. Gradually the\nwhole party assembled on the for\nward deck Virgil, leathery faced\nand bright eyed, was there chew\ning his cigar, also Kettering, going\nabout and making up to every\nbody. It made Neill sore to see how\nall these men were enjoying the\nsituation. As Virgil put it:\n“A man-hunt is the greatest\nsport of all boys."\nBonniger proceeded to post his\nmen at salient points about the\nships. A guard was stationed on the\nforward bridge of each vessel and\nanother on the after bridge. Prom\nthese positions they overlooked the\ntower decks. He also placed a man\non each of the three gangways that\nconnected the vessel Everybody\nwas provided with a powerful\nflashlight Bickel and his three\nmen brought the force up to 30.\nWhile they waited for Bonniger\nto complete these arrangements.\nTouay’s Birthdays\nHenry A.

Senator .Frederick Hale\nof Maine, born in Detroit, 63\nyear* ago.\nEear Admiral Adolphus An\nKettering approached Neill. “Have\nany luck in town?”\n“None whatever,” said Neill.\nKettering lowered his voice.\n“Gosh! I certanly feel for you in\nthis situation, Wheatley. The strain\nmust be awful!”\nThis gave Neill a nasty start So\nKettering knew, too. How many\nspies were there around him?\nKeeping his face, he said: “I don’t\nget you, Mr. Kettering.”\n“Oh, you don’t have to keep that\nup with me,” said Kettering. “I’m\non your side. If there’s any trick\nwe could pull off together, you\nhave only to say the word.”\nNeill silently cursed. “I don’t\nknow what you are driving at.”\n“Well, I am sorry you won’t trust\nme,” said Kettering. “I would help\nyou if I could.”\nThe men being posted, the lead\ners of the party went into Captain\nBickel’s cabin to study the plans of\nthe ships. Bonniger said: “We’ll\nstart searching on this ship.”\n“Is it likely they would hide\nso close to me?” asked Bickel.\n“The ladder is on this ship,” said\nBonniger. “How else could they\nget aboard or leave?”\nNeill breathed easier. This gave\nhim a little time.\nMuch Too Good A Plan\nBONNIGER spread out the cabin\nplans of the Montpelier. In ad\ndition to her public rooms, she had\na couple of hundred sleeping cab\nins strung along the five decks.\n~4lWe need 50 men to do this\nright,” grumbled Wilson. “It’s\nworse than mine galleries.”\n“We’ll do with what we have,"\nsaid Bonniger. “We’ll start at the\ntop and work down. Notice that\nthere are five sets of stairways. A\nguard must be put on each so that\nwhile we are going down one\'stair-\ni way our couple can’t be running\nup another. Wilson, Longcope,\nWheatley and I will do the actual\nsearching. On the lower decks\nwe’ll divide forces and one pair\ntake the starboard cabins, the\nother port. As we finish each deck,\nI’ll blow a whistle and everybody\nwill move one flight down the\nstairways together. Thus if they\nare aboard this ship we are bound\nto trap them on the lowest deck."\nEverybody approved this plan.\nIt was much too good a plan to suit\nNeill; it quadrupled his difficulties.\nHowever, his mind had begun to\nwork again, and a scheme was be\nginning to take shape. Before they\nleft Bickel’s cabin he took a look\nat the plan of the Abraham Lin\ncoln. The little veranda of Janet’s\ncabin, he saw, was under the\ntriblfth window on the promenade\ndeck, countlg from the bow.\nThe Montpelier was searched\nfrom bridge to keel in the manner\nlaid out by Bonniger. On the lower\ndecks, Wilson and Neill were told\notVt°gther. Wilson was a good\npolfoe office*, not brainy but con\nscientious. No cupboard, no cor\ntyft Rat Rooess escaped his atten\ntion. He flashed his light under\nevbry bunk. Neill was bored and\njumpy because the search dragged\nso. He thought: This cop would get\na jolt if he Knew the man he was\nlooking for was helping him look!\nWhen they finished with the\nMontpelier and passed over to the\nMontmorencie it was about nine\no’clock and as dark as it would get.\nNeill kept looking at his watch in\nsuch a manner that Bonniger’s at\ntention was attracted.\n“What are you worrying about\nthe time for?" he asked.\nNeill drew him aside from the\nothers, “m have to leave you tor\nawhile," he said, *Tm sorry. I saw\nray chief in Washington this after\nnoon. Some departmental business\nhas come up, and he said he might\nhave to call me at 9:30."\n“Sortv to lose you," said Bon\nniger, “but it can\'t be helped.
