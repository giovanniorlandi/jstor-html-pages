Each campaign brings to, the front some temporary questions, \' of expediency, which are intended, to blind the eyes of the thoughtless, and attract the floating vote., “Tip{>eeanoe and Tyler too” won, more votes than logical arguments., “Fifty-four forty or fight” aroused, the whole country and not a few, would have preferred the fight to, the fifty-four forty. And “16 to 1”, drives gold Democrats into the, Republican party, and silver Re, publicans into the Democratic, ranks., However, back of all these cam, paign cries, deeper than the money, question, more important than the, subject of imperialism, more vital, to thesfuture welfare of tho nation, than militarism, is the radical dif, ference between the two great his, torical parties on the tariff ques, tion. It is not a question of pro, tection and free trade. No party, advocates and no government prac, tices absolute free trade. The, Democratic party has, however, for, years advocated in its platforms, the well defined policy of “a tariff, for revenue only,” refusing to rec, ognize as democratic the wisdom,, justice or propriety of affording, either protection to American labor, or American capital invested in, American industries. (, The avowed Republican policy,, often reiterated in national plat, forms and enacted into law, as is, evidenced by the McKinley and the, Dingley tariff bills, openly affirms, that the Republicans favor a pro, tective tariff that will encourage, the investment of American capital, in manufacturing enterprises and, insure to American labor, both na, tive and naturalized, the advantage, of “a fair day\'s wages for a fair, day’s work.”, Both of these plans have been, tried within the memory of most of, those who will cast their votes next, November., The Wilson-Gorman tariff bill, and the effects thereof were Demo, cratic. The Dingley bill and its, results are Republican. The, effects produced by these two meas, ures should be carefully weighed, by every voter who desires his bal, lot to influence national prosperity, and personal advantage., Under the operation of the, Wilson-Gorman revenue tariff, the, income of the government was~ not, sufficient to pay current expenses., The tariff for revenue only did not, produce the revenue. Government, bonds were sold in time of pence to, pay the daily obligations of the, Democratic administration. From, being a debt-paying nation we be, came a debt-creating nation. In, dustries languished. Mills shut, down. Factories closed. Building, ceased. The army of the unem, ployed increased. Panic came., Banks failed. Fortunes crumbled., Labor begged in vain for work., But just as soon as the people, could express their verdict at the, polls, Cleveland was repudiated, the, Wilson-Gorman bill declared want, ing and a change was demanded., With the election of a Republi, can President and a Republican, congress, a protective tariff meas, ure was enacted. The Dingley bill, became a law. What have been, the results? The national treasury, overflows. \' The Nation has fought, to a successful issue two wars and, has been paying debts at the same, time. Bond issues have given, place to bond redemption and re, funding the oustanding obligations, of the Nation at a lower rate of in, terest than was ever before secured, Iby any Nation in history, Mills, have been started. Factories have, been running day and night., Wages have been increased. Labor, lias been profitably employed. The, exports during the four years of, RnnnlOioori inriff hnvo, , exceeded the combined amount, of all the exports of the Nation, (luring all the previous years of our, history from the beginning of Wash, ington’s first administration to the, close of Cleveland’s last adminis, tration., There is the record. None deny, , it. The books have been audited,, ( and the balance is known to all., 1 What do the American voters, i want? A return to the Wilson-, Gorman tariff bill and panic times,, , or a continuation of the Dingley, bill and McKinley times. Your, votes next November will decide, , the question., The imperialism of the Ameri, can idea gave the French power to, throw off the old regime and enter, into the dominion of individual, sovereignity. It has made more, than half a score of Latin Ameri, can Republics strung along the, Andean mountain chain, every one, of them children of American, thought and of American example,, and still sheltered under the strong, arm of American protection., America never consulted with cow, ardice, or took counsel with the, fearful. She rejoices as a strong, man to run a race, and cares not, how hard the task may be provid, , ing it be just. The Republican, policy which so long has guided the, destiny of republican America has, been just and generous, opening, the door of opportunity to all, open, ing markets that looms may spin,, furnaces blaze, chimneys smoke,, trains fly and ships sail, making, work, mantaining wages and pay, ing honest toil and American skill, the highest wages in the best, money in the world. The Repub, licans stand for imperialism of op, portunity, the dominion of achieve, ment, the kingdom of manly lal»or,, royal remuneration for loyal service., If this be imperialism let the en, emies of the republic make the, most of it. The party that freed, tho black man, gave work to the, white man and deals justly with, the brown man does not hesitate to, go before the sovereign voters of, the country and ask for indorse, ment., Some sincere, able statesmen,, like Senators Edmunds and Hoar,, who disapprove of the Republican, policy of expansion, nevertheless, are working hard for the re-elec, tion of McKinley. They reason, that if the Republican party has, made mistakes, the Democratic, party could be trusted only to make, far worse ones; that with its no, torious, and-in hundreds of instan, ces criminal enmity to the colored, race of this country, the Demo, cratic party is not the party to en, trust with the work of freeing the, brown people of the Philippines., Reasoning also that questions oi, good government at home are more, important than policies abroad,, those more logical of anti-expan, sionists bitterly oppose a third, ticket or any other movement which, can result only in helping to de, stroy the civil service, degrade the, Supreme Court, and reduce the in, dustrial workers of the country to, the level of the coolies of China., For a man who left the parly on, account of the silver question the, ’ Hon. Charles A. Towne managed, to soy but little on the subject in, his recent letter of withdrawal., Mr. Bryan need not worry about, i the safety of the republic.

ROSS. - - Proprietor., Bunyan’B “Pilgrim\'s Progress" wa->, recently translated Into Chinese, with, curious Illustrations by native artists., Before the Boxer outbreaks began tnt, volume was In great demand In Pekin, A camel, with an ordinary load of, 400 pounds, can travel twelve to four, teen days without water, going four, teen miles a day. Camels are tit to, work at five years old, but their, strength begins to decline at twenty, five, although they live usually until, forty. They are often fattened at thir, ty for food, the flesh tasting like beef, An Arisona editor has a neat way of, expressing himself. Referring to a re, cent lynching in Skull Valley, a local, paper thus quietly chronicled an im, portant event: “There was no regular, trial In the case of Denver Jones. He, had a brief interview with a few, ‘friends In the woods, and It Is certain, that hereafter he will not Interfere, with his neighbor’s horses.”, Dr. Lasar of the Hygienic Institute,, Konlgsburg, Germany, calls attention, to the remarkable power of lerion, Juice In destroying the diphtheria, bacillus. Out of fifteen cases of acute, diphtheria and eighty other cases of, throat disease, for which lemon Juice, was used as a gargle, only one case, proved fatal. Lemon juice must be, dilutee when used as a gargle., An affecting incident occurred at, Sioux City. George Denison, aged 8,, and George Lewis, aged 12, were bath, ing, when the former was attacked, with cramps and screamed for help., Lewis tried to save him, but both were, drowned. The father of Lewis came, on the scene, but did not know who, the lads’were. He dove after them,, and became crazed with grief when he, discovered that the body he brought, up was that of his own son., That there Is true “sporting blood’, In Central America Is attested by th* l, following advertisement spread across, the top of a page of The Guatemala, Herald early In June, before the Re, publican National Convention met:, “A gentleman desires to wager 10,000, pesos that William McKinley will br, elected President of the United States, at the election to be held In November, next. No wager for less than 500 peso.-, accepted. The money has been place !, in the hands of W. J. Rhyder and will, be deposited In any of the banks of the, city, persons accepting this offer hav, ing the privilege of naming the depos, ltory.’’, William C. Royal, a wealthy resident, of Georgetown. Penn., who died uc, May 31 and whose will has been jus!, probated, devised his entire estate, valued conservatively at $50,000, to thf, Woman’s Branch of the Pennsylvania, Society for the Prevention of Cruel tj, to Animals. Mr. Royal devises to his, widow, Emily L. Royal, his “horses, dogs and any other animals I ma>, possess. But should my wife be sc, situated at any time as to make the, care of said animals Inconvenient oi, burdensome, then and In that case it, Is my wish that upon her request ths, care or custody of said animals shal, devolve upon the Woman’s Branch o!, the Pennsylvania Society for the Pre, vention of Cruelty to Animals.”, A discharged soldier recently re, turned from the Philippines tells a talc, of a shirt which is too good to be lost, His company was returning from £, long and tiresome scouting trip, in, which most of the men had lost the, greater part of their wearing apparel, when he saw on a clothes line in th<, ground of a residence adjoining a big, stone church two very good shirts, hung out to dry. As he had at the, time only half a shirt to his back, he, proceeded to help himself to a whole, one, whereupon a woman came out ol, the house and said to him. In passable, English, “You will pay for that or, the Judgment Day.” “Madam,” he re, plied, “if you give such long credit 1, will take both shirts,” which he pro, ceeded to do., A German engineer has hit upon a, very happy use for the phonograph, instead of a guide at exhibitions. The., new device will be used for the first, time at the automobile exhibition at, Berlin; any visitor to the exhibition, will need but to call the attendant,, who will put the roller containing the, description of the exhibit in question, Into the phonograph, and he will then, be able to learn, “by word of ma, chine,” all the details of the object, he is desirous of enquiring into. The, apparatus will not repeat a long, mo, notonous harangue such as one is ac, customed to hearing from guides at, exhibitions and in cathedrals; the vis, ltor can break off his conversation, with his unseen guide at will, and, have any remark repeated as often as, he likes., The Columbia River canneries have, been making experiments In the can, ning of shad, and have been so suc, cessful in their efforts that a new fish, ing industry may be developed In the, Northwest. The flavor of the shad is, universally recognized as delicious,, and the only objection to this flsh Is, the many small bones that exist in it., This objection Is entirely done away, with In the canned product, as the ex, treme heat to which the can Is sub, jected disintegrates the bones, and, they are not noticed., THE STAMP MILL AND, NOT THE PULP MILL, A Bimetallist Who Voted for Bryan in 1896, Explains the Situation,, Denver, Colo., Aug. 15.—(T0 the Re, publican.)—Many Republicans In Colo, rado supported Mr. Bryan for the pres, idency in 1896. Most of them did not, intend to permanently leave the Re, publican party. They conceived It tbeir, duty to unite with other bimetallists In, the endeavor to accomplish one spe, cific change of policy, which, under, conditions then existing, seemed of, prime Importance and feasible, through Democratic success at the, polls. The effort was futile, and since, then conditions have so changed as to, make Impracticable and dangerous, what then seemed feasible and salu, tary. Moreover, the attitude of the, Democratic party Is not such ns to now’, Invoke the confidence of hard-money, bimetallists., 1. Ooiunge and currency conditions, In the rest of the world have so, changed since 1800 ns to make Inde, pendent bimetallism impracticable,, even if we had a Congress and presi, dent disposed to bring it about., In 1890 It could well be argued that, the United States could maintain the, parity of the metals if her mints were, open to both metals at the statutory ra, tio of 10 to 1. All the coined silver of, Europe was then circulating as money, at a higher gold value than our ratio, would give It. India and Japan were, still depending on silver as their only, coined money; and having but one met, al for monetary uses, this would not be, drawn to our open mints. Under the, conditions then existing, the current, product of the mines would be the on, ly large source of supply to the mints., How is It now?, Since 1800 Japan has changed her, coinage laws, definitely adopting the, gold standard and recoining her gold,, so that a coin of a given denomination, contains about one-half the amount of, gold It formerly contained, with the re, sult that the ratio of value of gold to, silver, In the coinage of Japan is now, 28% to 1, Instead of about 10 to 1, as, formerly. If our mints should now be, opened at 10 to 1, ten Japaneses silver, yen would be convertible here into, about nine sliver dollars; but ten gold, yen would be convertible Into only $5, of American gold. But iu Japan $lO of i, our silver would Intrinsically be of the, same value ns 11.15 silver yen, while, $lO of our gold could there be convert, ed Into twenty gold yen., Russia lias since ISOG reformed her, coinage laws by a similar process, so, that the gold imperial, which formerly, was valued at ten rubles, Is uow val, ued at fifteen rubles. Silver Is no long, er standard money, but a limited legal, tender, and the ratio between gold and, silver Is 28% to 11 and Russia, which, formerly had nominally a silver stand, ard, has now definitely adopted the, gold standard., The following conditions result: If, our mints were open to the free coin, age of both metals at 10 to 1, then ten, Russian silver rubles could be convert, ed into $7.48 In American silver dol, lars; but ten Russian gold rubles could, be converted Into only $5.14 in gold. In, Russia $lO of American silver would, intrinsically be equal to 13.57 silver, rubles, but $lO in American gold could, he converted there Into 19.43 gold, rubles., It must be apparent that the opening, of our mints to the free coinage of, both metals at the ratio of 10 to 1, would cyiuse a great rush of gold from, the United States and a corresponding, rush of silver from foreign countries, to our mints., India, which suspended the coinage, of silver In 1893, further carried on her, process of coinage change by definite, ly adopting, in September, 1899, the, gold standard and attempting to intro- I, duce that standard into the actual cur, rency of the country, fixing the ex, change sterling rate of the rupee at Is., 4d., which makes theratio of value be, tween gold and silver 22 to 1. The re, sults are, of course, similar to those, mentioned above ns to Japan and Rus, sia., Under these legislative changes, abroad, the opening of our mints now, to the free coinage of silver at the ra, tio of 10 to 1 would present a radically, different problem from that which was, considered in 1890. The immense ac, cumulation In India—that “sink for sil, ver”—supplemented by the silver coin, age of Japan and Russia, would come, into direct competition with the current, product of our mines. Under present, conditions, the inevitable effect of an, attempt to change our coinage laws, by, the Independent adoption of free coin, age of silver, would be to render us, silver monometallic, and the revolu, tion In commerce and industries In this, country and abroad would be startling, In the extreme., 2. Financial and Industrial condi, tions do not now present such neces, sity for radical action ns appeared In, 1890., The tremendous and unexampled In, crease in the gold supply has very, largely counteracted the effect of legis, lative demonetization of silver. Na, ture has, to a large extent, furnished, the cure for evils resulting from legis, lative errors; and through the opera, tion of divers causes this has been es, pecially so in the United States. It, has not been so in Russia, where, prices have been fnlllng, owing to the, contraction of the currency; and there, are other European countries which, have not been so favorably situated, \' an the United States to enjoy the re, 1 suits of the great Increase in the gold, 1 supply., In 189G attention was called to the, great fall in the amount of per capita, circulation of money. In the United, States, between July 1, 1804, and July, 1, 1800, the fall in those two years was, $3.18 per capita. Since then there has, been a rapid increase in per capita cir, culation, the increase amounting to, $T».G0 per capita in the four years, our, present per capita circulation being, larger than at any other time in the, last thirty years., The exports of domestic merchandise, from the United States rapidly dimin, ished from 1892 to 1805, but in the, last four years these exports have in, creased beyond all precedent, and are, now very far in excess of anything, ever known in our history., In 189(1 there had for some year*, been a steady fall in ail values, as, shown by the index numl>er8. The, Economist index number in 1801 was, 2,224; in the spring of 1807, it had fal, len to the number, 1,885, which was, far lower than had ever been regis, tered In more than fifty years. Since, then it hns rapidly Increased, and on, April 30th of the present year it stood, at 2,240, which is higher thnn it has, been before in the last sixteen years., 3. True bimetallists are hard-nfoney, men; flat paper money is the most dan, gerous foe to the silver cause. In 1808, the Democratic party in Congress ad, vocated the Issuance of paper money,, not backed by coin, for carrying on the, expenses of the war with Spain. The, Colorado Democracy, at the convention, which nominated Governor Thomas,, denounced the Republican party for Its, unwillingness to resort to that scheme, of manufacturing money., The “Monetary League,” a present, appendage of the Democratic party, in, a cry for aid just issued, demands “the, Issue of paper money from time to time, in quantities sulflelent to make up any, deficit in the supply of silver and gold, for the demands of trade.” The Dem, ocratic national platform just adopted, demands the retirement of national, bank notes “as fast ns the government, paper or silver certificates can be sub, stituted for them.” The Rocky Moun, tain News jubilantly calls attention to, this declaration, and to the fact that, nothing is said about “coin redemp, tion,” and says: "This is Progress with, a big P.”, It is manifest that the present Demo- |, cratie idea is not bimetallism, but in, flation, with flat inflation preferred., True bimetallists look to the smelters, and the stamp mills, and not to the, pulp mills, for money material., JOEL F. VAILE., More ItiiIn., According to the Bryanlte wallers,, the United States are imi>overished, and on the way to ruin by the gold, standard and the trusts. Half of the, British war loan has Just been taken, by this impoverished and ruined coun, try, which would have gobbled the, whole of it if it could have got It., This impoverished and ruined coun, try has so much money to invest that, even in the present unparalleled ex, pansion of business, it can’t find ways, enough at home of salting down its, profits. It has money to lend to Eng, land, ns it had money to lend to Rus, sia; and it may soon be drawing inter, est from all over the world., The farmers can’t get men enough to, harvest their crops. The railroads, can’t get cars enough to carry the, freight. The savings banks are so, swamped with deposits that they don’t, know where to Invest them. Yet the, Bryan spouters of lamentation are sure, that the country is being impoverished, and ruined by the gold standard and, the trusts and is about to be wrecked, totally by imperialism., If this is ruin, the American people, would like to be ruined every year.—, New York Sun., Culm SecuroH Paris Honors., Washington, Aug. 19.—The island of, Cuba, with her exhibit at the Paris, Exposition, has achieved a notable, success.

Some of the, questions Indicated unmistakably that, the questioner was out of temper, but, Mr. Bryan responded to all of them, quickly and with good nature. This, gentleman Interrupted Mr. Bryan to, wards the close of Ids speech by sug, gesting that the Filipinos were on a, par with our Indians. To this Mr., Bryan responded:, “Now, as I understand you. you think, we were right in taking the property of, the Indians?”, I “No, sir.”, “Then do you think it right to take, the property of the Filipinos?”, “No, sir,” responded the man in the, audience, "and nobody is going to. How, does the treatment of the Filipinos dif, fer from the treatment of jailbirds iu, this country? I)o you believe iu pun, ishing the Jailbirds?”, Mr. Bryan—Your face is the face of, an intelligent man. and you cannot fail, to see the difference between putting, men into the ]>cnltciitiary for the com, mission of a crime, and going over to, the Philippines and taking charge of, the government of tie* Filipinos.”, “When I see a man like you,” was the, response of the gentleman, “who favor, ed the peace treaty, 1 think that man, ought to have some consistency about, him.”, “I am much obliged for your mention, ing that,” replied Mr. Bryan, for I, should not feel like bringing it to your, attention unless called upon to do so. I, urged the ratification of the treaty and, also urged the passage of a resolution, promising independence to the people, of the Philippines, and if your Repub, lican administration had passed the, resolution, there would not have been, one drop of blood shed in the Philip, pines.”, “Oh, that is your opinion.”, ! “That is not only my opinion, but if, you will stop to think about it and, give the public the honest result of, your thoughts, it will be your opinion, that if we had made the same promise, of Independence to the Filipinos that, we did to the Cubans, we would have, had no conflict there. Had we treated, Cuba as we did the Philippines, there, wop Id be war in Cuba to-day, and had, we treated the Filipinos as we did the, Cubans, there would be no war iu the, Philippines to-day.”, ! The questioner made an indistinct ref, erence to Mr. Bryan’s capacity for the, Presidency, and asked Mr. Bryan if he, believed the Filipinos were capable of, self-government. To this Mr. Bryan, replied:, \' “Admiral Dewey stated in a message, to the secretary of the navy that the, Filipinos were lietter capable of self, government than the Cubans, and that, he based his judgment on a study of, both races. Whether you believe as I, | do or not, you are not able to draw the, line between the natural right of the, !
