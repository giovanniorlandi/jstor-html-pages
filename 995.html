        <pre>['WENATCHEE DAILY WORLD\nVOLUME I.—NO. 175.\nW. H. PAULHAMUS\nTELLS OF BENEFIT\nOF CO-OPERATION\nAdvises Wenatchee Fruit-Growers to\nUnite to Secure Better Prices and\nLower Freight Rates-Would Set\nWhole Valley to Apple Trees.\n\\V. H. Paulhamus, president of the\nPuyallup Fruit Grower* association,\nwho delivered several addresses be\nfore the Farmer\' Institute in Wenat\nchee, has done more than any other\none man to establish the strong associ\nation of fruit growers near Tacoma,\nknown as the Puyallup Fruit Growers\nassociation. To a tepiesentative of\nthe Daily World in speaking of the\nbenefits deliver? from co-operatiou\namong fruit growers and the work\nwhich his association has accomplish\ned Mr. Paulhamsus said:\n"I relieve in the necessity of co\noperation among farmers and fruit\ngrowes. In this age or co operation\nthose who fall beyond the pale of those\nwho are thus protected are unmerciful\nly fleeced. Their only plan for sal\nvaiton is that of co-operation and with\nthis co-operation amity. Fonr years\nago the fruit growers iv the Puyallup\nvalley were unorganized and payiiiß\n$<150 for a car for the ship]dug of their\nfruit to points on the Missouri river\nand getting poor service at that. Then,\ntoo, they were beat by commission\nmen and their frui 1 ; handled recklessly\nso that the profit theygot on their pro\nduct? was liittie, it any. Then the\nfruit men cot together aud demanded\nthat they be given a square deal. The\nresult was that we are now paying only\n$125 per car on fruit shipped to Miss\nouri river points and oar produce is\nbeing handled carefully and nets us\nmuch more asiie from the saving in\nfreight.\n"I will say that when w* oragnized\nfour years ago we made mistakes and\nit almost cost us the lite or our organ\nization at one time.\n"The finishof the first season found\nour oiganization $4,000 in debt, and\nwith suoli a deficit staring them in\nthe face the members of the associi\ntionstood loyally together and refused\nto give in. The result was that dar\ning the oomine season we studied con\nditions, made improvements where\nthey were necessary ana hired a com\npetent overseer so that at the end of\nthe. second season we had paid up our\ndobt and were $2,000 ahead. Oar or\nganization is founded on a corporation\nbasis, organized unaer tr.e laws of the\nstate governing,,such, and its members\nare all stockholders. Each share is\nsold at $1 and no member is allowel\nto purchase more than fifteen shares\nof the stock. Our oragnization has\nmore to put up with than any organ\nization of its kind. ...OS. v\n"In the greatcare\nis necessary as tiie\'-air. ia\ncars has been known to spoil\' a whole\ncarload of berries, mauy little things\nlike this, which go to keep the berries\nin marketable shape, must be constant\nly kept 5 n mind and the greatest care\nused in handling the berries from the\ntime tbey leave the held until they\nreach the buyer.\n"With yon it is different, here you\nraise one of ibe hardiest and best\nshipping™ apples in the state and\nshould find a market for yonr produce\nall over the eastern and southern\nstates. Yon can do this if yon will\norganize into a onion in whioh the\nmembers will stand loyally by eaob\nother and live up to tue rules of each\nan organization. By this means you\ncan get contracts from eastern firms\nfor much more per box than you are\ngetting now, you can by this union of\nyourselves and the eastern commission\nWENATCHEE, WASHINGTON, TUESDAY. JANUARY 23, 1906\nmen get the rates of the railroad re\nduced and the servioe improved. To\ndo this yon must do your part and\nlive up to your contiaot, whioh means\nthe shipping ont of an uniform apple\nand the sorting over of tlie same at\nyour warehouse. Yon will have com\npetition but witli care and your great\nnatural advantages you c*n beat them\nall. If I could I would plan every foot\nof Wenatchee valley with apples iv the\nassurance of finding the best markets\naud contracts five yeats ahead. You\nhave the goods, now organize an 1\npush them.

The\nmove of asking for an increase in\nthe irrigation fund, not by direct ap\npropriation, but by a loan from the\nnational treasury, lias met with favor\nand almost all of the commercial\nbodies which nave written the com\nmittee, have already petitioned their\ncongresmen to use evervpossiole effort\nto secure rhe desired legislation.\nThe letters include a commonicat\nion from Governor Mead in which he\nsays:\n"T h°ve :ead with a great deal of\ninterest the literature you have for\nwarded tc me in relation to the move\nment which yon have undertaken\nlooking for a modification of the irri\ngation law. It stiises me that the\nsuggestion is an excellent one and if\ncarried out would be a benefit to the\npublic.

JANUARY 23. 1906\nTHE PHILPPIINE TARIFF BILL.\nWith the passage by the houso of\nthe Philippine tariff bill the coalition\nof so called insurgents in that body\nmeets a disastrous reverse. The ex\ntreme high-taift members, backed by\nthe sugar and tobacco representatives,\nwere to have united with tlie oppo\nnents of the statehood bill to kill both\nmeasures.

Of\nthe negative votes •">? were cast by Re\npublicans. Possibly a number of the\nr >7 are still willing to join with the\nDemocrats in opposing, the statehood\nbill but the defeat ot their plan\'s up to\ndate is not likely to encouiage them\nin this undertaking. They have\nalready gone on r°cord as opposing\ntheir party on an important issue aud\nrney can scurcely wish to arouse furth\ner \'antagonism of this obaracter.\nWhat fate awaits the\nbill at the hand of the senate remains\nto be seen.

Etc.\nCopyright 1905, by\nG. W. DILLINGHAM COMPANY\nSynopsis of Preceding Chapter\nSir Henry Morgan, former pirate, having\npurchased immunity and knighthood\nfrom the king of England, has reformed\nand has become vice governor of Jama\nica. He is deposed and, killing the offi\ncers s\'nt to arrest him, determines to\nbecome again a freebooter. Benjamin\nHolingold, ex-pirate, who has been bit\nterly wronged by Morgon, joins the for\ntunes of the latter in order to seek an op\nportunity to wreak vengeanoe on him.\nHaving recuited a crew of ex-pirates and\nother desperadoes, Morgan seizes an\nEnglisn frigate and murders her crew\nOff for the Spanish coast in search of\ntreasure, in a desperate action,wherein\nare shown the daring and re sou rueful\nness of Morgan and the courage of his\nmen, he defeats two Spanish frigates\nand captures their convoy, a treasure\ngalleon carrying an abbess and priests\nas passengers, Morgan shows his\nqualities by heaving overboard a mutin\neer and shooting down a priest who at\ntempts to save the man Wrecked on\nthe Venezualan coast, near La Cuayra,\nto which city Morgan is attracted by\nDonna Mercedes de Lara, daughter of\nthe viceroy ot Venezuela. Donna Mer\ncedes and Captain Dominique Alvarado,\ncomandante of La Guayra, are in love\nwith each other, but the unknown par\nentage of Alvaradc prevents their mar\nriage. Donna Mercedes is betrothed b"\nher father to Don Felipe de Tobar, f rien\nof Alvarado. Alvarado is tempted by h\nloved one to forget his dutyto tne vicero\nand Don Felipe and to fly with her in\nstead of donveying her safely from Car\nacas to La Guayra. He resists. On th\njournsy to La Guayra rather than giv\nup her lover, Donna Mercedes tries t\ncoTimit suicide by riding her horse ove\na precipice .Mvarado saves he r life,and\nwhen she pleads with him fc love yields\nto her and decides thut love outweirjhs\nhonor. Sir Henry Morgan and his rui\nfians capture the lovers Donna Merce\nees repays a caress the pirate with\nstripes from her riding whip. The cap\ntured abbess stabs herself rather than\naid Morgan in his pian to capture La\nGuayra. La Gueyra is taken and sacked\nby fie buccaneers. Hornigola, intrust\ned, intrusted with the care cf Mercedes\nand Alvarado. declares the dying abbess\nto be the mother of the li.tter. Horni\ngold, to further his revenge on Mor\ngan, releases Alvarado to bring aid to\nMercedes and the csptured city. Mer\ncedes, in the piaatejs .lands, holds him\noff in the hope of rescue by her lather\nand Alvarado Alvarado, by great toil\nreaches Caracas in time to bring the\ntroops to the rescue. He confesses to\nthe viceroy his yielding to the argu\nments of Mercedes and is condemned.\nThe end was upon him. yet with the\nold instinct of life he lifted himself\nnprm ms toes. He raised his arms as\nfar as the chains gave him play and\neaogat the chains themselves and\nstrove to pall, to lift, at last only to\nhold himself up, a rigid, awful figure.\nFie gained an inch or two. but his\nfetters held him down. As the water\nsupported hlra he found little ditliculty\nIn maintaining the position for a\nSpace. But he could go UO higher—\nIf the water rose an inch more that\nWould he the end. lie could breathe\nonly between the breaking waves now.\nThe body of the black was swung\nagainst him again and again, the head\nof young Teach kissed him upon the\ncheek, and still the water seemed to\nrise and rise and rise. He was a dead\nman like the other two indeed, he\nprayed to die—aud yet in fear he clung\nto the chains and held on. Bach mo\nment he fancied would be his last, but\nhe could not let go.\nBy aud by the waters fell. He *<»uld\nnot believe it at first. He still hung\n■Depended and wailed with bated\nbreath. Was he deceived. No, the\nwaters were surely falling. The sec\nonds seemed minutes to him: the min\nutes, hours. At last be gained assur\nance. There was no doubt but that the\ntide was going down. The vfaves had\nrisen far. hut he had b i lifted above\nthem; now they were falling, falling!\nYes. and they were bearing away that\naccursed body and that ghastly head.\nHe was alive still, saved for the time\nbeing. The highest waves only touch\ned his breast now. Lower, lower, they\nmoved away. Reluctantly they lin\ngered, but they fell they fell.\nTo drown. That was not the judg\nment of Cod for him then. What would\nIt was just out of reach of his lips\nIt be? His head fell forward on bia\nbreast—he had fainted in tlie sudden\nrelief of hie undesired salvation.\nLong time be hung there, and still the\ntide ebbed away, carrying with it all\nthat was left of the only two wiio bad\nloved him. He was alone now surely,\nsave for that watcher in the tmshes.\nAfter awhile consciousness returned to\nbim again, aud after the first swift\nsense of relief there enme to him a\ndeeper terror, for he had gone through\nthe horror and anguish of death and\n*ad not died. He was alive still, but as\npelpless as before.\n( It was morning now. On his right\nband the :un sprang from the ocean\nbed with liiu same swiftnesn with\nwhich it had departed the night before.\nLike the tide, it, too, rose and rase.\nThere was not a cloud to temper the\nfierceness with which it beat upon his\nhead, not :i breath of air tj blow across\nhis fevered brow. The blinding rays\n■truck him like hammers of molten\niron. lie stared at it out of his fren\nzied, bloodshot eyes aud writhed be\nneath its blazing heat. All his faculties\nwere merged into one consuming de\nsire for water—water. Tlie thirst wafl\nIntolerable. Unless he could get siiiue\nlis brain would give way. lie was dy\ning, dying, dying! Oh, God, he could\nnot die; be was not ready to die! Oh,\nfor one moment of time, for 0m 1 drop\nof water— ood—God—God!\nSuddenly before Ms eves there arose\na figure. At firs! hV fancied it was an\nother of the apparitions which had\ncompanied with him during the awful\nnight nod morning, hut this was a hu\nman figure, an old man, bent, haggard,\nlike himself, with watching, but with a\ntierce mad joy in his face. Where bad\nhe come from\'/ Who was be? What\ndid he waut? The figure glared upon\nthe unhappy man with one fiery eye\nand then he lifted before the captive\'s\ndistorted vision something. Wh:it was\nit—a cup of water? Water, water brim\nming over the cup! It was just out of\nreach of his lips- so caol. so sweet, s >\nInviting! He strained at his chains,\nbent his head, thrust his lips out. He\ncould almost touch it—not <|Uite! lie\nstruggled and struggled and strove to\nbreak his fetters, but with nit avail.\nThose fetters could not be broken by\nthe baud of man. He could not drink—\nah. God!—then he lifted his blinded\neyes and searched the face of the other\n"Hornigold!" he whispered hoarsely\nwith his parched and stiffened lips, "is\nit thonV"\n"Aye. 1 wanted to let you know\nthere was mater here. You must be\nthirsty. You\'d like a drink V So would\nI. There is not enough for h itli of\nus. Who will get It? 1. Look!"\n-Not ail- not all!" screamed the oi l\ncaptain faintly as the other drained the\ncup. "A little! A drop for me!"\n••Not one drop," answered Hornigold;\n"not one drop! If you were in hell and\nI held a river i" my hand you would\nnot get a drop! It\'s gone."\nlie threw the cup from him.\nj "I brought you to this I! Do you\n| recall it.- You owe this to me. You\n! had your revenge; this is mine. But\nI it\'s not over yet. I\'m watching you.\n! I shall not come out here again, but\nI I\'m watching you, remember that! 1\ni can see you!"\n"Take that knife you bear -kill me!"\n\'"I don\'t want you to die—not yet.\n| 1 w:Mit you to By©—live a long time,\nj and remember!"\n"Hornigold, I\'ll make amends! I\'ll\nhe your slave!"\n"Aye. crawl and cringe now. you dog!\nI swore that you should do it! It\'s use\nless lo beg me for mercy. I know uot\nthat word: neither did you. Remem\nber, I watch:"\nHe threw his glance upward, stopped\nsuddenly, a fierce light in that old eye\nof his.\n"Look up." he cried, "and you will\nsee! Take heart, man. 1 jruess you\nwon\'t have to wait for the tide, and\ntlie sun won"t bother you long. Re\nmember. I nn wa ening you!"\nHe turn**! and walked away, conceal\ning himself iv the copse once more,\nWhere he could see aud not he seen.\nThe realization that he was watched\nby one whom lie could not see, one\nwho gloated over his miseries and suf\nferings and agonies, added the last\ntouch to the torture of the buccaneer.\nHe had no longer strength or man\nhood. He no longer cried out after\nthat one last appeal to the merciless\nsailor. He did uot even look up In\nobedience to the old man\'s injui ction.\nWhat was there above bim, beneath\nbim. around bim, that could add to his\nfear? Ue prayed for death. They\nwere the first and last prayers that had\nfallen from his lips for fifty years,\nthose that day. Vet when death did\ncome at last he shrank from it with\nun increasing ten a- and horror that\nmade all that I c had passed through\nseem like a triti".\ni o Hp Oontinn 1\nNEW GOVENOR TAKES\nOFFICE IN NEW MEXICO\nSauta Fe, N.
