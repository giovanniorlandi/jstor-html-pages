A girl, about twenty years old, couiely, with ??, good figure and a bright face, entered., "l>auce?" asked the manager., The girl replied by pirouetting about, in good style., "Sing?", She ran the scale. Her voice was a, full, round soprano and very sweet., The rauge wjis remarkable., "Act?", She recited a passage In a well, known play., "You urt\' engaged.*\', Miss Fredrica Harrow proved a suc, cess. She had in her a certain spirit, of delivery thai was es|>ecially appro, priate to the i>arts she took. One roie, she played was that of a female Mep\'u, Istophelea. When the audience left, the theater after the performance they, felt that they had been under the In, fluence of a deilclously bad girl., Oue Sunday morulng the manager, went to church. It is possible fox a, manager of a burlesque troop to go to, church and with religious motives., But this manager did not go with such, motives. He weut because he had, heard that In the choir was a remark, ably flue tenor. The services opened, with a tenor solo. The manager was, astonished. There was Miss Harrow, in man\'s clothes. He not only recog, nized her by her face, but through her, voice, which was Miss Harrow\'s lower, notes., But there was one difference between, Miss Harrow soprano aud Miss Har, row tenor. The latter was as heavenly, as the former was devellsh. She sang, an "Ave Maria," and It seemed that, an angel rather than a mortal was, praying to the Virgin. The manager, did not wonder that the tenor was ex, citing attention But he had no use, for him in burlesque opera. He ex, pressed the good, and with that the, manager was not concerned., "Where were you last ulght?" asked, the manager the next day when Miss, Harrow came to rehearsal., "At home", The manager said uo more. He had, slept over the teuor\'s identity and had, come to the conclusion that he could, not be Miss Harrow., Not long after that a man In his, troupe fell sick, and there was no one, to take his part., "How low are bis lowest notes?", asked Fredrica., The manager told her, and she said, that she thought she could take the, part He also asked her to sing the, lower notes, but she said she couldn\'t, Jump right Into them; she must get it, by practice. She left him. agreeing, to be ready for the part when required., Miss Harrow in man\'s clothes was a, very different person from Miss Har, row In woman\'s clothes. In the first, place, instead of singing the part In a, low soprano voice, she sang It as a, tenor. In the second, she made a fail, ure in her action. Instead of be.\'ng, adapted to burlesque, she sang as If, she were in oratorio., "What the dickens Is the matter, with you?" said the manager after the, first act. "Your singing Is all right, Indeed, it\'s a wonder for a woman?, but you act as if you were preaching, a sermon", Miss Harrow huug her head and, looked hurt. However, she finished, the performance, and before the man, ager could catch her to find any more, fault with her she had gone home., But the next day when she went Into, the theater he tackled her., "There was something funny about, your work last night. How did you, get dowwTo a real baritone, and what, made you act like a clergyman?", "I told you that with a little piac, tice 1 could do the low notes, and. as, for my acting, the part Is different, from those I\'ve been playing. It is, not a rollicking role.", "And it wasn\'t taken out of a hymn, book, either.", "I\'m sorry. I thought I could take, baritone parts sometimes.", "So you can. but not where there\'s, any deviltry In them.", In a few weeks the regular baritone, was down again., "I think." said Fredrica. "I can take, that role. It\'s more serious.", "Who\'ll take your part?", "I think 1 can take them both.", "Nonsense!", "I\'ll show you how It can be done to, morrow at rehearsal." And she trip, ped away., When the rehearsal came and the, manager went on to the stage to con, duct it he was more bewildered than, ever. There were two Fredrica Har, rows, fine and superfine., -How\'s this?" asked the manager,, staring from one to the other., "Permit me," said Fredrica. "to In, troduce my twin brother. Frederick, Harrow. He has a tenor voice.", Then she admitted that she had sub, stituted hi\'" for herself in the man\'s, part; that while she was all frolic he, was religiously emotional., "Well," said the manager, "I want i, you two. 1 have a scheme for en !, opera Involving a transformation j, scene, man metamorphosed to woman ,, and woman metamorphosed back to j, man. You two will do it to perfee- 1, Hon.", And so it was that the twins appear- ;, ed in a part prepared for them and, reaped a harvest. Tho opera was call- j, ed "The Devil aud the Saint", NATURE SPARES, The Stricken it use From Grief., What a fortunate provision of nature, It la. that deprives the rose of mental, iu!Torlng; for how poignant would bo ltd, t;r\'ef to discover.
