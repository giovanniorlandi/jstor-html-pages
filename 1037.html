Some\nof the eastern papers believe that\namong other measures that may be\npassed is a resolution for resubmis\xad\nsion. While this is not probable it\nwill have its advocates here and\nthere throughout the state. Such a\nresolution will be useless, however,\nunless some proper substitute for\nthe present prohibition law is sug\xad\ngested. The people of North Dakota\nare overwhelmingly against the open\nsaloon as it formerly existed and\nthere must needs be a campaign of\nenlightenment—something feasible\nstringent and in the interest of real\ntemperance offered—before the pres\xad\nent prohibition article is voted out of\nthe constitution.\nis every chance for boss ism—one\npower.

It has been suggested\nthat in the attempt to "doctor" the\npresent law it might be made useless,\nand the suggestion comes from form\xad\ner friends of the law.\n"It is also stated that there may be\nan attempt on the prohibition law at\nthis time. While we do not believe\nMr. Burke would sign any bill remov\xad\ning the penalty clause of the law, nor\nthat such a bill could be passed over\nhis ye to, yet it is evident from the\ninterest shown In various p&rts of\nthe state, that a resolution resub\xad\nmitting it to the vote of the people\nwill be able to carry. While. the\nchances are for the law, fn case such\na resolution is passed, it is difficult\nto estimate. The Red river coun\xad\nties would probably vote to retain\nthe present law, but the west, with\nits new settlers and changing popu\xad\nlation, would out-vote the east and\nthe chances are that it would earry\nlargely.\n"Many other suggestions have been\nmade as to what is likely to happen^\nbut there is plenty of time to look\nthem in the face when the time\ncomes. There is little question but\nthat the largest lobby ever assembled\nat Bismarck, will meet there .the\ncoming winter."\nThe recent ruling of the interstate\ncommerce commission that under the\nnew law railroads would be pro\xad\nhibited from exchanging transporta\xad\ntion for newspaper advertising and\nthat all transportation must be paid\nfor In cash—actual money—only,\nhas provoked considerable diacua-\npfon,\nnot so much on account of the\nimportance of the question as tb«\nprinciple involved.

It is an\nideal site for any public structure and\nmore especially, for the temporary\nhome of the youthful Indians as their\nnative heath where roamed their\nancestors for hundreds of years lies\nbefore their eyes. The Northern\nPacific railroad passes the site but a\nfew hundred feet away and travelers\nwill have an excellent opportunity to\nsee what the government is doing to\ncivilize* and make good citizens of\nthe younger generation of Indians,\nmany of whose fathers were but a\ncomparatively short time ago in\ndeadly array against the whites.\nThe buildings, that is, the main\nbuildings, will face the river.
