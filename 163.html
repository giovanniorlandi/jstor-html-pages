I conn- lie fori? the voters of this\ncounty, hs an aspirant for the ofliee of County .Imlge for another\nterm.\nFor nearly four years have served you in this capacity, and in\nso doing I have always tried to r-xecute the duties of this office in an\nhonest, fair and conscientious imager irrespective of party or class.\nThere arc certain qualifications a man should have in order to\nhold successfully the office of County Judge, the most important of\nwhich, is his knowledge of the legal profession, of which 1 have some\nlittle. Only once for a period of nearly fifty years, have the people\nof this county, elected a Judge that did not have some qualifications\nalong this line, and now they have another aspirant, which is in no\nway acquainted with the legal profession, a necessary requisite for\nthis office.\n1 am not seeking the office for the PRESTKiE attached as my\nopponent informed me, hut. for the good I can do in serving tins pub\nlic. J am a young man. depending on n;y own efforts, with my future\nbefore me, and it is my desire to make that future as bright as pos\nsible by honest and efficient service for the people of this county.\nIn making this race I have put forth my best clforts to make it as\n.-lean as possible. Never have I mentioned another candidal-\'s name\non either side, as I had my own race to run, and that I am doing at\npresent, and will continue so to do until the close of the polls on\nelection day.\nThe unfortunate of this county I have tried to treat most kindly.\nXevcv an appeal came to me, which, after investigation was not heeded-\nAbout forty little boys and girls came under my observation,\nthese children having no fathers and mothers to care for them, hut\n1 always found them a home, and today I feel a great deal of com\nfort in knowing that these homeless children are being eared for and\neducated.\nAt this late hour of the race, the charge has been hurled nt me\nand the other candidates, that we are parties to a dirty scheme of\ncirculating in this county a paper which draws religious lines. That\ncharge is disgraceful and without foundation. I defy any man to\nprove that I am in any way connected with .such a low, defiled sys\ntem of campaigning. If in order for me to be elected, I had to resort\nto any such means I would not have the office The man that would\nniake such a charge without proof, and he lias none, is a disgrace and\nshould not be countenanced by fair-minded American citizens. It is\nonly a charge to confuse the minds of the voters, and when made was\ndone so at this late hour, so I could not prove my innocence, but the\niian that started it knows. I went into this race clean, and find be\ning my judge I will get out clean. Win or lose I shall always know\nI did my best honestly and openly, with no malice of any kind against\nany man, but with my face turned toward the right, ami I Mieve that\nwill prevail.\nWith best wishes to all of the people of this county and with my\nappreciation of your support if you can lend me same. 1 am.\nRespectfully yours,\nII.
