Lowe.\nAlthough Harrison Aid ridge\nwas disapyointed in his effort to\nkill the deer, but he added one\nchapter to his experience when he\nsaw the bear pounce upon the\nhog, then he found that the sud\nden flight of the bear was caused\nby being stricken with the rattle\nsnake, he-had not failed to ob\nserve that rewards are due to the\ndiligent, and as the deer had no\noccasion to\' be frightened by his\nown former experience, he might\nyet.be able to bring down the\nlargest buck in the forest.\nIn passsing through the forest\nHarry would occasionally go by\nthe rock where he had observed\nthat the deer had been lying, and\nhe found that the deer had been\nfrequently browsing about the\npoint of the ridge and lying on\nthe same rock. But he had begun\nto feel that he would be disap\npointed in killing the deer that\nseason, as the cool weather was\nfast approaching; the chestnuts\nhad fallen aud he kn w that the\ndeer had hardened his horns by\nthis time, and that he would\nsoon take in a wi ler range in the\nmountains. . So, late in the fall,\nthere came a very warm day for\nthat season of the year; there was\na gentle bre\'ze coming from the\nnoi th-Wt\'Kt. so Harry d tcided to\ntry his liaaJ blw eoul time. \'Ha\nsaddled his horse, took his trus\nty flint-lock and started to seek\nthe object he had been so zeal\nously watching all the fall. He\nrode through the mountains un\ntil he approached within a few\nhundred yards of the point of the\nridge; he hitched his horse and\nthen proceeded to the up-turned\ntree root he occupied on the for\nmer occasion and thrust his riffle\nthrough the opening of the tree\nroots, carefully observing that\nthere waspoyderinthepan, ttnd\nafter remaining quiet for quite a\nlong time, wondering whether he\nwould-be. successful or disappoin\nted as before, he heard the noise\nof a number of animals in the dis\ntance; then his heart began to\nbeat and thump as though it was\ntrying to get up in his throat,\nand he could discern that the\nsound indicated that the animals\nwere coming nearer and nearer,\nso instead of seeing the large\nbuck alone, he observed that he\nhad in company with him three\nothers. Harry remained almost\nas still as death itself until the\nlarge buck appraached the rock,\nthen he dropped down and began\nto pant while the three others\nbrowsed on the tender shoots\nand picked up chestnuts. Harry\npulled the trigger of the flint\nlock gun, after he had taken a\ndeadly aim, and the large buck\nturned over and died while the\nothers scampered away in the\nforest.\nAfter the dear turned over Har\nry was soon at his side with dirk\nin hand and severed his jugular\nveins, and being an expert in the\nbusiness, he soon removed the\nhide and separated the venison\ninto four pieces, then by remov\ning a portion of the skull he man\naged to keep the large antlers to\ngether. After rolling the hide up\nand tying his venison together\nwith hickory withes, Harry went\nfor his horse he had brought a\nlong for the purpose of packing\nhis load home in the event he\nshould be successful. So after\nplacing the venison across his\npack-saddle and tying the hide\nbehind, he took the large antlers\nin his hand und led his horse\nhome.\nBur it w i l ) i .ia. lie io.

Cal. Dec. 27. Three\nyears ago the mother of Roy J.\nThompson testily commanded\nher son to "take those contrap\ntions off the house" because\n"they mussed up the place so.\nToday this Hi -year-old lad, her\nalded as the youthful wizard oi\nthe electrical world, is being of\nfered fabulous sums for the right\nto commercialize his "contrap\ntion." The apparatus that "mussed\nup the place" is taking electricity\nout of the air and converting it\ndirectly into dynamic energy.\nIt is lighting the Thompson\nfarm house with incandescent\nbulbs attached to a wire aerial,\nand operating a motor from the\nsame source.\nThis Uncouth country lad has\nconfounded scientists and upset\nold theories of electrical phenom\nena, if his discovery stands up to\nthe apparent achievements.\nA grammar-grade education,\nhad gleanings from borrowed\ntechnical books, together with a\nshort experience as assistant to\na stage electrician, are his mental\nequipment.\nEXPLAINS IT.\n"The electricity is gathered up\nthereon the aerial," he explained.\n"It is drawn down through wire\nby powerful magnets into a loose\ncouple tuner and shot into Ley\nden jars. From there it passes\nthrough several transformers,\nlowering the load by steps from\n2500 to 110 volts, and then into\nthe motor."\n"See!" The one-horse motor\nbegan to purr as he threw a\nswitch.\n"For the lights it is stepped up.\nto increase the arape\'ras, and\ngoes through a condenser.

As a rule,\nas stated in one of my former let\nters, this place is comparatively\nfree from fogs except that which\nclings around the tall mountain\npeaks, and when the weather is\ncold these fogs freeze and are con\nverted into rain. But during this\nspell of weather the order was re\nversed. About the time the snow\nceased to fall there was a f o g\nwhich hovered over the valley\nand smaller mountains; a gentle\nbreeze coming from the east\ncaused the dampness to freeze in\nto little spears on every object\nwith which it came in contact, all\npointing to the west, some of\nwhich were from four to six inch\nes in length. Poultry wire resem\nbled broad, white lace, while the\ntelephone and electric wires had\nthe appearance of white ropes of\nfrom two to three inches in diam\neter, but the tallest mountain\npeaks were free from this mantle\nof white partcles of ice.\nOn the morning of the Gth inst.\nwhen t he sun came forth it shown\nonly upon the peaks reaching an\naltitude of about 5.000 feet.

The people, for va-\nrions reasons, are considerably\ndivided on this question; some\nfealing that it is not their duty\nto pay this tax when they derive\nno benefits therefrom, having no\nchildren to send; others that the\nfunds have not been judiciously\nexpended, while still others think\nthe children have not been re\nceivinsr value in full for the\nmoney paid out for teachers, etc.,\netc. Our school committee is com\nposed of good business men, and\nwe take it that they have used\ntheir very best judgement in the\nexpenditure of every cent of schoo\nmoney that has passed through\ntheir hands, and the teachers, who\nhade striven so hard from year\nto year, who would not claim per\nfection for themselves, have done\nthe best they could, possibly\nand do not deserve censure. As\nfar as we are individ ally concern\ned, there is little if any more ben\nefit coming our way from the\npublic schools, and to our mind\nnow is the wrong timeto abolish\nthe tax for more reasons than\none. In the first place, we have\na debt of several hundred dollars\nhanging over us for a new and\nhandsome school building which\nmust be paid, and if the special\ntax is done away with, the debt\nmust be liquidated at the expense\nof our public school at least 10\nper cent of the amount, and in\nterest on remainder every year,\nthereby shortening the school\nterm each year quite considera\nbly. So far as we are concerned, ,\nthere is but one serious objec\ntion to our district school, and\nthat is the few grades that are\ntaught. As it has been for some\ntim?, the public school here has\nonly carried the pupils through\nt\'.ie sixth grade, and when they\nhave completed this primary\ncourse they are supposed to be\nready to enter the Appalachian\nTraining School for Teachers,\nwhen, in fact,4 the great State in\nstitution has no primary depart\nment, but the management has\ntried, and is trying, to provide\nas best it can, in its over-crowded\ncondition, to provide for a num\nber of pupils who justly belong in\nthe public schools for some time\nto corns. The Stata is annually\nS9iiing right into our midst\nthousands of dollars for the edu\ncation of our people, and now for\nus to vot9 down the spacial tax\nis certainly a step backwards in\nthis day of educational advance\nment. Instead of voting to weak\nen the public school interests in\nBoone, let us do all we can to\nfoster it by putting our heads\nand pocket-books together and\nlet it go out to the State that we\nhave for a fact, the model school\nof the mountains, instead of the\nreport that the people of Boone,\ni right where one of the States great\ninstitutions of learning is loca\nted, have voted down their spec\nial tax and are running a four\ntooths s:hool inathousand-dol-\nqouse trying to liquidate a\nthat is hanging over the\nty.

He, of course, wrote to the\nauthorities of the State of h i s\nbirth and asked them for his birth\ncertificate.
