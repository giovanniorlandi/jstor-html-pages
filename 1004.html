The, cause was the killing of a boy by a, negro. The negro was arrested and, placed in Jail but a mob soon formed,, broke into the Jail and burned the., negro at the stake. The negroes ral, lied and began a fire upon the whites, and the most desperate scenes have, followed. The militia has been call, ed out., We Have It!, FRESH APPLE CIDER |, Right from the orchards, of Oregon at 60c a gal., GANTY & FRANDSON, At tho meeting of the City Council, last evening Mr. Shaw as chairman, of the Ways and Means committee, reported that the money authorized, by a previous meeting of the council, to be borrowed had been negotiated, and the council was therefore In posi, tion to meet all obligations. He^, also reported that 250 copies of ifce, book of ordinances recently ordered, to be printed had arrived up from\', Juneau; that so far as appeared the, job was well done but that he would, not recommend payment of the bill, until the books had been examined., Also the matter of their distribution, was discussed. It was moved that, they be placed in tho hands of some, city officer who \'would bo charged, with giving a copy to all taxpayers, who applied for one. This matter, was deferred, however, until another, time when the books would be ac, cepted and ready., City Magistrate Tatfner reported, fines and costs collected during, October to the aniounl of $.\'103.20., A communication was read from, Supt. Hahn referring to the proposal, for the crossing of the tracks for the, road to the cemetery and requesting, that, since the agreement had not, been entered into the papers be re-j, turned.

Mr. Tanner asked if a man, was to be employed to watch another, man when working for the city. Mr., Shaw said that Mr. Tunner was not, a member of the c#mcll and had no, voice at this time or at any time un, til he was asked to answer questions, and thereupon sharply declared he, would not O K Uie bill. "Very well,", said Tanner, "I will sue the city for, it.", The audience had hardly subsided, into its customary semi-somnolent, state than it was caused to sit up, and take, note again by a bill from, Will Clayson, read by the clerk. It, was for " 4 nf No. 3 fire, hall for 32 months rrom March 14,, 1905 to Nov. H, i908., Members of the council, remember, ing the state of the treasury, gasped., "What does it mean? Has he gone, mad? What is it all about? read it, again, were the exclamations., Clerk Doherty explained that there, had been an agreement between the, city and Mr. Clayson whereby a, shed out by the shops owned by Clay, son should be used to house the hose, cart, for one year from the 14th of, March, 1904, consideration, $1? the, cart to be returned to its former, home at the expiration of the year., The shed or house had continued to, be used by the city for the period, stated in the bill. Mr. Doherty read, the bill again to convince the coun, cil that it. was real and with it a, note saying "You will notice I havo, granted a year\'s rent free, I have de, cided to render a bill for the period, of use of the premises since the ex, piration of the contract and to fix, tlie rent at $25 per month. Please, give the matter your attention as I, ueed the money in my business.", The first member of the council, that found breath moved the bill be, referred to the chief of the fire de, partment, and this was done., The Fire and Water commltt\'*?, was insrtucted to make report, upon the cost and advisability of the, purchase of a thawer for use of the, city i, Mr. P.

It, ?us the pride and pleasure of all on, lookers, an earnest of the Alaska of, the future, an Alaska of permanent, homes and fixed citizenship. The, o\'lfbratlou next Fourth of July will, contain a .similar exhibit the increas, ed siz?- of which, according to re, ports from the busy stock, will add, to the swelling pride and pleasure of, i he citizens in that same proportion, as the rauks are swelled., That this condition is not local and, singular to Skagway but obtains over, the entire district and betokens a, sturdy population of native-born Am, ricans, aud thus a new race of, strong, self-confident and masterful, people, is shown by reports that fre, quently appear in the records of, other sections of the district. This,, for instance, from the Nome Nugget, is typical and cheering:, .75, 2.26, 9.00, "One of the best evidences that, Nome is improving at a rapid rate, and is fast becoming a better resi, dence town than ever before was, th>- demonstration last night of the, High school pupils who for the sake, of a library appeared before a large, audience with a splendid entertain, ment. The eyes of the Nome people, were opened last uight to something, they have never seen before. They, have observed that the youog peo, ple are rapidly becoming men and, women, but never seemed to realize, it fully until last night. Nome is, proud of her children because of the, advantages they have received; a, bracing climate and hurried strenuou, lift- combined efforts to develop, little bodies ami minus until they, have grown Urge and strong. The, ;>irit of the young here is one ot, t lie finest ever seeu anywhere; they, are progressive, courageous and, dauntless They are learning to do, tilings many of them under difficul, ties. but the results they obtain are, effective because of the efforts they, put forth., "The entertaiuinent last night was, one worthy of any city. The whole, thing pleased. Fathers and mothers, watched their youug with growing, admiratiou and with splendid reason, for it. There was encouragement, from all Every one was glad aud, proud of the things which were done., They did them well and are deserv, ing of great credit. They should be, encouraged as much as possible. Al, aska lias made theui little men and, women who are not afraid to try;, their own efforts have placed them, in positions where they can show re, sults.", Mr. Haas says Heney ruined him, by calling him an ex-convict. If Mr., Henej was wrong in the statement, Mr. Haas might have turned the ta, bles on Heney and at least done, something to harm if not ruin him, for making a false statement, while, at the same time correcting before, the public the false impression. If, he was an ex-convict It would seem, that Haas ruined himself by being, such and this is the more probable., At any rate he has made a mess of, it this time. By his act whereby he, expected to get even he has replac, ed Heney in public wateem and sym, pathy and put himself out of the, game entirely in a most disagreeable, manner and left a wife and family to, shift for themselves and learn, with, others, to dishonor his name. All, for very slight provocation one way, or another., So we know where we are in the, matter of the Taft policy as to the, tariff? he does not keep us waiting., He will keep his pledge to have the, tariff question submitted to congress, for Its consideration promptly. This, Is well. And the beauty of It is that, this can be done by Taft without, causing much ado while, with the, uncertain policy of Bryan to deal, with, a declaration of this ktnd would, cause, the utmost uneasiness., With the wily old dowager empress, of China put by by her enemies with, "slow poison," the machinations ol, many years have reached their cli, max. The presumption is that these, machinations had a definite purpose, In bringing about a new regime., Therefore the anxiety at Washington, and the world around Is wvll founded, aud we may look for as dramatic, sequences as of inception. We are, likely to be entertained during the., long dark evenings that are coming, over us., A press dispatch from Lincoln,, Neb., says: "Bryau takes his de, feat philosophically." He should put, a squirt of lemon in it. ? Wbitehorse, Star., Guess he found the squirt of lemon, already in it? where the people put, it., The kaiser has hitherto done pretty, much as he pleases.

Lucas, deceased., Date of first Insertion October 30., Date of last insertion December 4., | Love In a Dictionary, [Original.], Not long after my being graduated as, a civil engineer I was placed In charge, I of a section of a rallror 1 running, through a large tract composing the, hacienda of Don Jose Miranda. On the, evening of my arrival on the ground, I received an Invitation from him to, muke his house my headquarters. Had, I been older I might have declined to, place myself under obligation, but In, youth one Is not so likely to refuse, favors., Nor Is one at that age overscrupulous, In love. Don Jose had a pretty daugh, ter, Dona Ysabel, who was heir to a, considerable portion of his estate. I,, who had nothing but iny profession, and not much Income even In that,, should not have listened a moment to, the temptation to make love to this, heiress. When a youngster wishes to, do the right thing In such a case he Is, apt to beat the devil about the stump, by showing his heart to the girl In, some covert way. I oeat the devil, around the stump not only as a salve, to my conscience, but because I was, not afforded au opportunity to make, love openly. Besides, 1 bad no reason, to suppose that the young lady would, respond, and to think of receiving a, snub from her for proffered love quite, took my breath away. Frudeneo dic, tated a plan that was noncommittal., I never saw Dona Ysabel alone, but, I passed many evenings at the house, in company with the family. One even, ing I took a dictionary from the library, on pretense of looking for the Spanish, for a word I wished to use. Don Jose, was In the room with others, and Dona, Ysabel was looking over my shoulder., There Is a story that a courtier who, aspired to the favor of Queen Eliza, beth of England wrote his aspiration, and his fears on a wludow pane with, a diamond and received his reply In, the same way. The message and re, ply constitute a rhyme and are famil, iar to most people who have received, a finished education. Whether Dona, Ysabel had ever met with them I did, not know. While turning over the, leaves of the dictionary 1 stopped and, held my thumb for awhile on the, word "fain." Then, carelessly turning, over the leaves, I suffered it to remain, on the word "would." In this way, I Indicated the line:, Fain would I climb, but fear to fall., I had reached the word "climb" and, was looking for "but" when Dona, Ysabel walked away from me. I In, ferred that she had not seen through, my device, for If she had a natural, feminlue curiosity would have led her, :o remain where she was till 1 had, finished. Replacing the dictionary In, the library, 1 began a conversation, with her father about the location of, the railroad through his hacienda, a, subject In which he was interested., The next morning 1 arose and break, fasted, aB was my custom, loug before, the family were downstairs and was, going to my work when, passing, through the library, 1 was surprised, to see the dictionary lying open on a, table. Going to it, my eye rested on, the pages before me. which included, words beginning with the letter "I.", Under the word "If" I noticed a light, pencil mark., My heart Jumped. "If" was the be, ginning of Queen Elizabeth\'s reply to, the aspiring courtier. Rapidly turning, over the leaves to words beginning, with "If" I looked for "you." There, was a pencil mark under it. "Are", was the next word in the queen\'s reply,, and this, too, I found underscored. I, had seeu all I required to convince me, that I not only had a reply to my mes, sage, but the reply I desired. It was, this:, ir you\'re arrant, cumD noi ai i?,, completing tlio famous rhyme:, Fuln would I climb, but fear to fall., If you\'re afraid, climb not at all., It was so well known to Dona Ysabel, that she did not need to see It com, pleted after the word "climb.", On the surface, from this time till I, had finished iny work, Dona Ysabel, and I wero merely acquaintances. We, did not even use the dictionary or any, other means of communication, but, the night before I was to take my de, parture, again making a pretext of, finding a word. 1 withdrew tho volume, from the library aud began a hunt, Ysabel stood over me, and I pointed, to the following words:, Tho way la dark. The road I fall to tee., As soon as I had completed my mes, sage Ysabel left me and, taking up, some embroidery, devoted herself to It., But I watched her and saw that she, was in deep thought. After awhile she, laid aside her work and, turning to the, dictionary that lay on the table, began, to turn over the leaves. I went and, stood over her. She pointed out tho, following reply:, Mako your demand and leavo the rest,, to me., After the family had retired for the, night and 1 was having a few final, words with Dou Jose about the section,, of the railroad I had located I sud, denly astonished him by asking for, his daughter\'s hand. It was not only, my impudence that startled him, but, wonder that 1 should have made such, a demand without something of a, courtship as Is customary In the United., States. Before he could make any re, ply I said that, of course, he and hi*, daughter would together agree upon a, reply which could be sent me and made, iny exit as rapidly as I could without, appearing precipitate., It was not till six mouths after my, request that I received a note from, Don Jose, stating that his daughter**, will had been too strong for him and, her wishes were paramount with him., { was Invited to the hacienda., SEBK??R TROWBRIDGE., The Piano., The tono of n piano Is beat when the, Instrument Is not next to a wall., Lincoln\'* Springfield Home., The Springfield home of Abraham, Lincoln was presented to the state of, Ullaol* la 1882 by Robert Todd Lin, coln.
