LX VIII\nDAILY\nELKO, NEVADA, SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1915\n\'OI?iui, NeWay, \'Reliable <3,\nElevoted t# tha \'Unbuilding and ^\nDeve toping of Etko County -\nNO. 13\nMAYER HOTEL A\nCREDIT TO ELKO\nEditor Triplett, of Wells Herald Pays\nLengthy Compliment to\nLocal Hostelry\n( From, the Wells Herald)\nIt is astonishing when one lands i\nin the town of Elko and is escorted!\nto the Mayer hotel to llnd there such,\na modern establishment. One is!\nat once confused by the elegance of:\nthe quarters and the courteous bear\ning or every member of the force of\ngenial attaches of the hotel.\n!t is an established fact that one\ncan travel all over the wist and will\nfind in no town of many times the\nsize of T.lko a hotel ot better con\nstruction. better equipment, better\naccommodations or more comfortable j\nsurroundings.\nSome years ago C. IC. Mayer and\nsou W. U. Mayer, determined that the\nconditions at Elko would justify the\nerection of a hotel of more than ordi\nnary proportions, and these gentle\nmen set about to accomplish the ob\nject of their belief. They were the\nowners of considerable valuable land\nand a small brick building, but lack\ned the necessary funds to carry to a\nsuccessful termination the erection\nand opening of a hotel such as they\ndeemed worthy of the town and such\nas the county would support. They\nbroa<*lied the subject to a number of\nthe leading business men of the coun\nty seat, but were received with the\ngeneral statement that the conditions\nwould not justify the expenditure of ;\nthe stuns of money they had calcu-j\nlated upon, t\'ndaunted by. the lack I\nof support they received at home \'\nthey set about to form a company and\nwent into the country for stockholders, j\nAmong the farming and stock raising\nelement of all sections of the county\nthey were received with greater at\ntention. and had practically no diffi\nculty in inducing some of the leading\nmen of the county to join with them\nand aid in supplying the funds.\nThe result is that the Hotel Mayer\nstands on- the main street of Elko\nclose to the Southern and Western\nPacific depots, a lasting monument to\ntheir fore-siglitcdncss and business\nacumen, <t < ivuit to its builders and\nowners a dividend payer to its stock\nholders.\nThe structure is of brick, three\nstories in height, with a frontage of\nJ25 feet and a cement basement\nunderlying almost the entire build\ning. With (lie addition of fifteen\nrooms, just being finished, the hotel\ncontains seventy-five rooms, every\none an outside room. The entire\nfront of tlie building is of plate glass,\nand in tin? structure are the post\noffice. a dry goods store and a jewelry\nstore.\nA description of the interior of\nthe building will, doubtless, b.- of\ninterest to the public generally.\nCommencing in the basement we lind\na room 75 by 80 feet in size, exclu\nsive of the furnace room. This\nbasement is nicely fitted up. Here are\nlocated a pool hall CO by 40 feet,\ncovered with cork carpet and con\ntaining six pool tahhs. which are in\nuse nearly all the time; a barber shop\nwilh three chairs and a capable and\nefficient corps of tonsorial artists.\nGoing to the first, or ground lloor,\nwo find the hotel office and lobby,\ncafe, kitchen and bar room. The lob\nby is thirty-five feet square, with\nwriting desks and tables and plenty\nof leather upholstered easy lounging\nchairs. Two sanitary drinking foun\ntains in the lobby furnish the guests\nwith an abundance of pure clear\ndrinking water. The ceiling in the\nlobby Is sixteen feet high, covered\nwith pressed steel and painted a\ncream color. From the celling are\nsuspended three handsome chande\nliers, eacli with a capacity of 250\ncandle power lights which with the]\ninnumerable number of small elec\ntric globes, furnish tin abundance of\nlight. The lloor of the lobby is!\nfinished in mosaic tiling. Passing to\nthe cafe is found a room 35 by 10\nfeet in size, with high celling and\nmaple floor, nicely carpeted with\nrugs and furnished in a manner sec- \'\nond to no cafe in the state. The\nkitchen, by 45 feet, is a model of\ncleanliness, containing large ranges\nand all the better Implements that\'\ncan be found everything so arranged\nas to be of the most use with the,\nleast expenditure of effort and time.]\nThe bar room is 35 feet square, with\nthe best of furnishing. Here, ns in\nthe lobby, the floor Is or mosaic\ntiling.\nFrom the ground floor one in;\ncarried to the upper stories ot the\nbuilding in an automatic electrically\noperated elevator, the only one or its\nkind In the state. Tills convenience, j\nWhen It was first installed, was looked j\nupon with awe by the guests of the\nhotel, but all are becoming accustom\ned to II, every one finding It mighty\nconvenient. The two upper floors are\ndevoted to rooms, many or which are\ncapable of being connected up en\nSTATE 9F NEVADA\nI\nNevada Leads Western States In Pro\nduction of Metals Per\nCapita\nMr. C. V. Heikeu of the Unit/.d\nStales Geological Survey lias recently .\npublished No. 25 ol Mineral liesourc- 1\nes of the United States for 1913. en- !\ntitled, "Gold, Silver, Copper, Lead and\nZinc in Nevada". According to this |\nthe stale of Nevada produced during\nthe year 1913 the following quantities\nand values in these metals :\n\' Quantity Value 1 )\nGold . .. 570,589.41 oz. *11,793.130\nSilver .. 10.090, 033.00 oz. 9,718,110\nflipper . 1)0,093,351.00 lb. 14,037,531\nLead . . 1G, 344, 023.00 lb. 719,13V !\nZinc.. .. 11,419,071.00 lb. 807,002\nThe total production of Nevada of\nthese 5 metals, therefore, amounted to\n?37,097,710. The rank or the princi\npal western mining stales in pro\nduction of these metals is ? Arizona, j\nMontana, Utah, Nevada, Colorado,\nAlaska, South Dakota. If, however, i\nthe production with reference to popu\nlation and area is taken into consid\neration, Nevada holds the more im\nportant position than is indicated by\nthe above order.\nDirector Lincoln ol the Mackay\nSchool of Mines has recently been\nstudying this point for the purpose of\npreparing diagrams ilustrativc of the J\nproduction of Nevada for exhibition\nat the Panama-Pacific exposition. He\niinds that using the figures for popu\nlation anil area, as given of Mii.cral\nResources for 1913, the per capita pro\nduction and the square mile produc\ntion are as follows:\nPer Per\nCapita Sq. Mi.\nNevada 459.21 337.23\nCalifornia 11.33 170.45\nUtah 122.02 530.17\nMontana 104.05 423.74\nSouth Dakota! 12.71 95.36\nAlaska 29S.38 33.21\nArizona 346.70 022.74\nColorado 44.35 341.89\nFrom this table it is evident that\nin per capita production , Nevada is\nahead of all other states, whereas in\nproduction per square mile, it is ex\nceeded by Arizona, Utah, and slight\nly by Colorado.\nsuite. Fifteen of the seventy-five\nrooms have baths attached, and there\nare four public bath rooms on the two\nfloors. The interior of every room\nis hard finished, and painted in cream\nand green colors. Every room is\nfurnished with a writing desk, brass\nbedsteads and an ample supply of\neasy chairs. Several of the best\nrooms in the structure are furnished\nI with Circassian walnut. Many of the\nj rooms have individual telephones,\n| there being twenty-eight in the house,\n1 also a long distance telephone booth.\nThe hotel also contains a large sam\nplu room for the use of commercial\ntravelers. Every room is supplied\nwith hot and cold running water and\nthe structure is steam heated through\nout.\nThe hotel was opened to the public\non February 9, 1914, less than a year\nago and from the very first met with\nthe best of patronage. During all the\npast season it has been crowded to\nj its utmost capacity, and hardly\na day has passed \'ml guests had to\nbe turned away. The rates at the\nHotel Mayer are more reasonable than\ncan be found in any city in the laud\nand the meals furnished at the cafe\nand lunch counter are as good as cau\nbe found in the cities of the coast.\nThe building was designed by Ware\n& Trcganza of Salt Lake City, and\nbuilt by J. F. Sehraven & Son of I In\nsame city. To date the building has\nl cost $127.(mio, and notwithstanding\n| the large sum of money involved is\npaying handsome returns on the\ni money, the profits to date being near\nI ly sixteen per cent on the investment,\nI showing that the people appreciate\n| the fact that they have at their ills\n| posal a hotel that is a great credit to\nthe county soat.\nThe officers of the Hotel Mayer arc\nC. E. Mayer, president; W. K. Mayer,\nsecretary-treasurer and manager. To\nthe latter Is due in great pnrt the\ncredit for the magnificent establish\nment. When the proposition was lie\nins considered lie made trips through\nout the county and succeeded in en\nllstlng (hi! financial aid of the stock\nholders. Since the construction com\nmenced and since the completion of\nthe building he has been always "on\nthe Job", giving every liltle detail of\nthe management his personal care and\nattention. He has aptly demonstrat\ned his efficiency, taste and executive\nability, as Is proven by the superior\nfoinlshiiiK and equipment of the ho\ntel and lis pronounced financial sue\nj cess. Although only a young man his\n[ successful management of this estab\nlishment has substantiated the trust\nthat was Imposed In him when lie was\nmade manager.

The action of the executoi .\nBank of Nevada Savings and Truf\ncompany, in surrendering a propoi\ntionate part of security on a note fo\npart payment on the same," was ai\nproved, and the sale of shares of stoc!\nin the Nixon National bank of Item\nand in the First National bank o:\nWinnemucca, to George Wingfleld, wa?\napproved and ratified.\nIn the first petition it developer\nJames New-lands had secured the en\ndorsement of Senator Ni.xon on hh\nnote for $20,000 in the Crocker Na\ntional bank, depositing securities ol\nthe Nort Coast Water company as\ncollateral. The bank delivered the\nbill and collateral to the indorser\'s\nestate and received payment. Re\nt-ently the estate received payment\nfrom Newlands of $8500 and surren\ndered part of the security. The bal\nance due is amply secured.\nIn the second petition report was\nmade that 289-4.fi shares of the Nixon\nNational bank of Reno had been sold\nby the executor to George Wingfleld\nat $100 a share and 305.76 shares of\nthe First National bank of Winnemuc -\nca had been sold at $350 a share, to\ntaling $3!i?;.4G6.

American manufacturers said they did not\nwish to ; dmit that their product was made in this country. They report\na populat impression that European manufactures are superior.\nThis impression is probably due to the business Joy-riding o( a form\ner period "Twenty years ago," said a shoe manufacturer recently, any\nthing went. You could put up a shoe with a pancake heel of ground up\nleather cl ips, pasteboard counter, and upper cut out of the loose leather\nin the be ly of a hide. Skillfully dressed, it looked good. You could sell\nit for 50 cents a pair under a good shoe. People would buy them over\nand over again, even though they wore poorly.\n"Todi.y," he said, "people pay their good money to get the best stock\nthere is t nd it would ruin my business were 1 to put out tile kind of\nmaterial .hat we built up our business on."\nProbi bly these conditions prevailed in many other trades. Twenty\nyears age was a .lerlod of fake advertising. It was anything to work off\nthe goods and get away with the money. You might get the same man\'s\nmoney over and over again, as he might fare no better if he tried other\ngoods.\nToi ay every substantial dealer, retail and wholesale, pushes his\nbest good a the hardest. He knows that the best material is none too\ngood, and that only by giving satisfaction can he build up permanent\ntrade.\nThere is probably no country on earth today where producers take\nsuch pains to turn out honest goods as the United States. If our busi\nness men lose trade as the result of the prejudice referred to above, they\nare payiu; for the mistakes of a past generation. But wide awake peo\nple know that a different spirit pre\\nils in American trade today.\nTHE FISi IN PRICE OF BREAD.\nTHE sensational advances in wheat Hour make it seem certain that\nthe price of bread will go up. This will hit the workingman even hard\ner than the high cost of beef. . J ??; .* j . ?\nBread gives more nutriment for the "money than the cheapest kind\nof meat.

With fields of\nBelgium and of France drenched with the blood of countless thousands,\nwith thousands upon thousands of widows and orphans in the warring\ncountries and sorrow untold hanging like a pall over Europe, comes the\nword of a great earthquake which has shaken Italy. Fifty thousand of\nits people have fallen to arise no more and twice that number are broken\nand torn.\nThis it a time when the war cloud was hanging over the country;\nwhen its leople were filled with the lust of blood and minds filled with\nthe desire to enter into the conllicts of the north. Has a mighty hand\ngiven to .\'taly a blow which will cause it to forget its thoughts of war?\nIt is something to consider. ?

America alone\nis trying lo keep them alive this wint\ner.\nThe commission for relief in Belg\nium, which is the only channel through\nwhich food is transmitted to the suf\nfering laud, has worked out with the\npostofTice department and with the\nexpress companies a plan whereby\nany one who is willing to eat a little\nless this winter in order that some\nBelgian woman or child may live, can\ncontribute his gift or food. Only\nimperishable foods, of course, can be\nhandled; for example ? beans, canned\nsalmon, rolled oats, yellow corn meal,\ndried, peas, granulated sugar, prunes,\nwheat. Hour, salt, etc. Belgium wants\nany kind of food, however, that will\nstand ocean transportation. Belgium\nalso vants clothing and blankets. If\nthe giver wishes it, the money ex\npended for parcel post stamps or for\nexpressage will be returned to him.\nDetailed directions for sending these\npackages and for obtaining the re\nfund money will be given upon appli\ncation a! any postoffice or express of\nfice lit the United Slates, or at the\'\noffice of The Commission for Relief\nin Belgium, 71 Broadway, New York \'\nCity.\ni\nO\nANN MARTIN COMING\nBACK FOR LEGISLATURE\nStatements have been widely pub-!\nlished that Miss Ann Martin presi- j\ndent of (lie Nevada Equal Franchise\nSociety, has accepted a position with I\nthe Congressional Union.

New York\nTimes.\nRUSSELL DORSE*\nOPERATED UPON,\nHusscll Dorsey was operated upon\nby Dr West this morning when a num\nber of shot were taken from his arm.\nOver a year aj;o the young man accl- j\ndently shot himself in the right arm i\njust above the elbow and it is nothing I\nshort of a miracle that tlio member\nwas saved. Nearly all of the biceps\nwas shot away and the bone- was\nsplintered.\nSome time after the accident uud\nafter the wound was healed the young\nman was taken to San Franc\'sco\nwhere one of the most unusual opera\ntions ever attempted in the wast was\nperformed by Doctors l\'icksford, Hum\nmel and oilier noted surgeons. An]\nincision utile ineh? - long was made in J\nthe thigh and a section of the minor\nsciatic nerve was removed together\nwith fatty tissue and membrane. The\nsection of nerve was used to unite the\nsevered cords in Uie arm, and they\nwere encased in membrane alter blood\nvessels had been picked up and in\nserted into the nerve section to sup\nply nourishment. The arm was then\nbuilt up with the fatty tisues. It was\nhoped that by the operation the func\ntions of the hand would be regained\nwithin a year.\nX-ray pictures taken at the time of\npreparation for the operation failed to\nshow a number of shot lying hard\nagainst the bone, and they were not\ndiscovered during the operation.\nThese shot have lately become dislodg\ned from the hone and they caused\nacute inilamation and finally separa\ntion.\nA number of shot were removed to\nday and they were perfectly Hat with\njagged edges. While the operation to\nday was not serious it was, of course,\nvery painful.
