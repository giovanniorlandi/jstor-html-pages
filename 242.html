After introducing the process and the suitability of taking complex network theory into supply chain network research,\nthe paper applies complex network theory into the agile supply chain network research, analyzes the complexity of agile supply\nchain network, presents the evolutionary mechanism of agile supply chain network based on complex network theory, and uses\nMatlab to simulate degree distribution, average path length, clustering coefficient, and node betweenness. Simulation results show\nthat the evolution result displays the scale-free property. It lays the foundations of further research on agile supply chain network\nbased on complex network theory.\n1. Introduction\nChoi et al. view the supply chain network as complex adaptive\nsystem (CAS) firstly, introducing a method of managing\nsupply chain network in the view of the complex adaptive\nsystem [1]. Surana et al. systematically and formally apply the\nCAS to solve the problems in the context of the supply chain\nnetwork and present that the appearance of information technologymakes\nsupply chain acquire complex self-organization\nability like biological system in the trend of atomization\nof supply chain market and atomization of organization\nentity [2]. Wycisk et al. summarize the attribute similarity\nand the behavior similarity between the supply network\nand the CAS. The attribute similarity includes heterogeneity,\ninteraction, independency, and learning ability of agency.The\nbehavior similarity includes self-organizations, dissolution\nzone (the zone between ordered border and disordered\nborder), and coevolution. He also deems that logistics system\nis not self-organization system absolutely. The parts of selforganization\nin logistics system mainly come from the parts\nof decentralized decision. Furthermore, the development\nof information and telecommunication technology made\nequipment and products intelligent, such as intelligent tag\nand RFID. The intelligent equipment and products are called\nintelligent units. The intelligent units improve the selforganization\nability of the supply chain network including\nlogistics system [3]. Hearnshaw and Wilson use the complex\nnetwork model to mirror the attributes of the supply chain\nnetwork in reality and deem that the supply chain network\nin reality is similar to the scale-free network and has its\ncharacteristics, such as short characteristic path length, high\nclustering coefficient, and power law link distribution [4].\nAt this time, the complex network characteristics of the\nsupply chain network have been explained systematically and\nclearly. The contribution made by those authors and experts\nleads to the fact that people make agreement on applying\nthe complex network theory into the supply chain research\n[5–8].\nThe widespread application of the Internet technology as\nthe representative of the rapid development of information\ntechnology and the development of economic globalization\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nMathematical Problems in Engineering\nVolume 2016, Article ID 4346580, 9 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4346580\n', '2 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\nmake the traditional business model face new challenges and\nmake business outsourcing caused by the horizontal and vertical\ncooperation become more popular. These make supply\nchain management become more important. At the same\ntime, fluctuations in market demand, such as the emergence\nof new products and services, shortening product life cycle,\nand product demand growth or atrophy, and changes in the\nexternal environment, such as natural disasters, strikes, war,\nand terrorism, all require that the supply chain becomes\nmore agile than ever in order to detect opportunities and\nthreats in the market and changes in the internal and external\nenvironment in time and then quickly make decisions\nand take actions to deal with them. This kind of quick\nresponse capability is the main feature of the agile supply\nchain. The agile supply chain emphasizes the quick response\ncapability of the supply chain which is different from resilient\nsupply chain. The latter emphasizes the capability that the\nresilient supply chain can quickly return to the original state\nafter being disturbed, possessing passive preventive property,\nwhile the agile supply chain actively detects changes and\nfluctuations and immediately takes measures to deal with\nthem in time, possessing active property.\nIn the agile supply chain research, the agile supply chain\nmodeling is an important approach. Lau et al. use virtual\nagent technology to design and develop the infrastructure\nframe of the agile supply chain system which improves the\nforecasting ability of supply chain [9]. Lou et al. deem that\nthe supply chain is composed of a series of agents. The\nfunction of supply chainmanagement system is to coordinate\nthese agents.They present the agile supply chainmanagement\nframework based onmultiagent theory to define the function\nand responsibility of the agent in order to coordinate supply\nchain operation by improving the efficiency and effect of the\ninternal division of labor in the agile supply chain [10]. Kim\ncombines object-oriented method with analytic hierarchy\nprocess to design the agile supply chain business model and\npresents the steps of identifying and expressing the business\nrules in the object-oriented model. This method emphasizes\nthe role of business rules inmaintaining the operation of agile\nsupply chain [11]. Z. X. Li and R. Li make the static structure\nanalysis and the dynamic behavior analysis on supply chain\nsystem based on the Petri net theory in order to achieve the\nintegral integration and coordinated control of each node\nin the supply chain finally [12]. However, this method does\nnot refer to the supply chain network evolution analysis.\nThe agile supply chain management system model based\non coordination decision center and workflow management\ntechnology proposed byCheng [13] and the agile supply chain\nmanagement system operation pattern guided by integrated\ninformation flow proposed by Gu and Qiao [14] both belong\nto a kind of static study in the view of the basic structure\nframework.\nIn summary, the current modeling research does not\ninvolve the dynamic evolutionmechanism of the agile supply\nchain network. However, there have been some research\nresults on the evolution mechanism of the supply chain\nnetwork based on complex network theory.\nIn the present results of evolution mechanism research\nof the supply chain network based on complex network\ntheory, there are researches on different types of supply chain\nnetwork, such as supply chain directed network [15], layered\nsupply chain network [16], cluster supply chain network [17],\nand disruption supply chain [18]. Besides, there are researches\non uncertainty [19], robustness [20]. There are researches\non evolution of supply chain network in different evolution\nconditions, such as the supply chain with leaving nodes\nand entering nodes existing together [21], the supply chain\nnetwork based trading volume [22]. However, the current\nresearch has not referred to the evolution mechanism of\nthe agile supply chain based on complex network theory\nwhich can describe the motivation and features of dynamic\nevolution process of the agile supply chain.This paper makes\nresearch on the evolution mechanism of the agile supply\nchain based on complex network theory.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We\nfirst introduce related concepts on the complex network\nand the agile supply chain network and then present the\nevolutionary mechanism of agile supply chain network based\non complex network theory and make simulation analysis\nand then discuss the features of scale-free networks generated\nwith the evolutionary mechanism model. Finally, the paper\nwill give a conclusion and discuss future research directions.\nThe schematic diagram of technology roadmap is as shown\nin Figure 1.\n2. Complex Network and\nAgile Supply Chain Network\n2.1. The Concept of Complex Network and Statistical Characteristics.\nThe complex network is composed of a cluster of\nnodes which are independent and connect with each other\nand is a type of network with high complexity. A node\nrepresents an individual; the edge represents the link between\nnodes. X. S. Qian gives relatively strict definition for complex\nnetwork: a type of network obtaining the following parts\nor all of characteristics: self-organization, being self-similar,\nattractiveness, small world, and being scale-free. The scalefree\nnetwork is a kind of typical complex network.Thismodel\nis proposed by Barabási and Albert [22] according to the\nphenomenon that degree distribution of networks in reality\nhas the attribute of power law distribution. The model is\ncalled BA model [23].\nIn the BA model, the evolution process of network has\ntwo driver factors: growth and preference link. Based on these\ntwo key driver mechanisms, the algorithm of the model is\nshown as follows.\nGrowth. The initial state of network has few nodes, 𝑚\n0\n; on\neach time step, a new node is introduced to the network; at\nthe same time, this new node connects with existing nodes.\nPreference Link.There is preference when a new node chooses\nother nodes to connect. The ratio of choosing node 𝑖 is the\nproportion to the degree of this node. Consider\nΠ\n𝑖\n=\n𝑘\n𝑖\n∑\n𝑗\n𝑘\n𝑗\n. (1)\n', 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering 3\nProblem on \nmotivation and \nfeatures of dynamic \nevolution of agile \nsupply chain \nnetwork\nComplexity of agile\nsupply chain\nnetwork\nSimulation \nanalysis with\nMatlab\nEvolutionary \nmechanism \nalgorithm of agile\nsupply chain\nnetwork based on\ncomplex network\ntheory\nStatistical \ncharacteristics\nanalysis\nDegree\ndistribution\nAverage shortest\ndistance\ndistribution\nClustering\ncoefficient\ndistribution\nNode betweenness\ndistribution\nFigure 1: The schematic diagram of technology roadmap in the research.\nAfter 𝑡 time step, the scale of the network changes, and the\nnumber of nodes becomes𝑁 = 𝑚\n0\n+ 𝑡; the number of edges\nis𝑚𝑡. The degree distribution of the scale-free network in BA\nmodel follows the power law distribution: 𝑃(𝑘) = 2𝑚2𝑘−3.\nIn order to reflect the topological structure of complex\nnetwork, the basic indicators are usually used; there are\ndegree distribution, average path length, clustering coefficient,\nand node betweenness [24].\n2.1.1. Degree Distribution. Degree 𝑘\n𝑖\ndelegates the number of\nedges which connect node 𝑖. the bigger the degree is, the\nmore important the node is. The formula of 𝑘\n𝑖\nis shown as\nfollows:\n𝑘\n𝑖\n= ∑\n𝑗∈𝑁\n𝑎\n𝑖𝑗\n. (2)\nDegree distribution of nodes in the network can be described\nby 𝑝\n𝑘\n; 𝑝\n𝑘\nis the probability that the degree value of a node\nbeing chosen randomly is 𝑘. In a statistical sense, 𝑝\n𝑘\nis the\nratio of the number of nodes whose degree value is 𝑘 to the\ntotal number of nodes in the network:\n𝑃 (𝑘) =\n𝑛\n𝑘\n𝑁\n. (3)\n𝑛\n𝑘\nindicates the number of nodes whose degree value is 𝑘;\n𝑁 is the total number of nodes in the network.\n2.1.2. Average Path Length. Average path length is the average\nshortest distance between all pairs of nodes in the network.\nThe shortest path is defined as the distance 𝑑\n𝑖𝑗\nbetween node\n𝑖 and node 𝑗. The formula is shown as\n𝐿 =\n1\n(1/2)𝑁 (𝑁 − 1)\n∑\n𝑖≥𝑗\n𝑑\n𝑖𝑗\n. (4)\n𝑁 indicates the total number of nodes in the network.\nAverage path length includes the distance from the node to\nitself (the value is 0).\n2.1.3. Clustering Coefficient. Assume that there are 𝑘\n𝑖\nnodes\nconnecting with node 𝑖 in the network; these 𝑘\n𝑖\nnodes are\ncalled neighbors of node 𝑖. The biggest number of edges\nis likely 𝑘\n𝑖\n(𝑘\n𝑖\n− 1)/2 among the 𝑘\n𝑖\nnodes. The clustering\ncoefficient 𝐶\n𝑖\nis defined as the ratio of the real number of the\nedges𝐸\n𝑖\namong these 𝑘\n𝑖\nnodes to the largest number of edges,\n𝑘\n𝑖\n(𝑘\n𝑖\n− 1)/2. Consider\n𝐶\n𝑖\n=\n2𝐸\n𝑖\n𝑘\n𝑖\n(𝑘\n𝑖\n− 1)\n. (5)\n2.1.4. Betweenness. Betweenness includes node betweenness\nand edge betweenness. It is a global variable and reflects\nthe influence and importance of node or edge in the whole\nnetwork. If there are 𝑀 shortest paths among nodes and\n𝑚 shortest paths of them going through node 𝑖, so the\ncontribution value of betweenness is𝑚/𝑀 which is made by\nnode 𝑖 to node pairs. Sum up all contribution value of node\n𝑖 to all other nodes and then use the number of total node\npairs to divide the sum of all contribution value. At last, the\nobtained quotient is the betweenness of node 𝑖. According\nto the same means of definition, edge betweenness is the\nratio of the number of the shortest paths going through the\nedge to the shortest paths of all node pairs. A lot of research\nshows that there is a strong correlation between the node\nbetweenness and the node degree.\nThe betweenness formula of node V is\n𝑔 (V) = ∑\n𝑠 ̸=𝑡,𝑠 ̸=V\n𝜎\n𝑠𝑡\n(V)\n𝜎\n𝑠𝑡\n. (6)\n𝜎\n𝑠𝑡\nis the number of the shortest paths fromnode 𝑠 to node\n𝑡 (node 𝑠 and node 𝑡 refer to two different nodes randomly);\n𝜎\n𝑠𝑡\n(V) is the number of the shortest paths from node 𝑠 to node\n𝑡 which go through node 𝑠 to node V.\n2.2. Concept and Characteristics of Agile Supply Chain. Agile\nsupply chain is focused on improving responsiveness and\nflexibility and is able to respond and react quickly and\neffectively to changing markets [25]. The characteristics of\nagile supply chain have four items [24].\n', '4 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\n2.2.1. Market Sensitivity. Market sensitivity refers to the\nability of mastering and making respond to real demand.\nThe production plan is driven by market demand, not by\nthe demand prediction which is made based on statistical\nanalysis on historical sale data.The enterprise can respond to\nthe customized demand through supply chain responsiveness\nat the fastest speed, and the whole supply chain remains\ndynamic refreshment in order to enable the core enterprise\nto satisfy customer demand.\n2.2.2. Virtuality. Due to the technical and artificial factors,\nthe demand information could be distorted easily when it\nflows from the downstream to the upstream. This distortion\nleads to deviation between production plan of production\nenterprises and supply preparation plan of suppliers and thus\nforms the bullwhip-effect; that is to say, a small change of\nactual demand of end users can cause a large scope change of\npurchasing quantity of upstream enterprises.The agile supply\nchain uses information technology to share the data among\nthe phrases of up- and downstream in the supply chain which\ncan construct a virtual supply chain so as to diminish the\nbullwhip-effect problem.\n2.2.3. Process Integration. Process integration means cooperation\nbetween partners, including cooperative work, com-\nmon product development, general purpose system, and\ninformation sharing among nodes in supply chain. Through\nthis process integration, the enterprise can be more concerned\nabout the development of core competencies on\none hand and integrate the suppliers in upstream and\ncustomers in downstream into the strategic planning of the\nenterprise on the other hand in order to achieve the optimal\nallocation of internal and external resources for enter-\nprises.\n2.2.4. Based on Network. The supply chain network is a\nunion of the partners who combine together like a network.\nEnterprises no longer participate in competition in the\nform of individual one but in the form of supply chain\nnetwork. Eventual winners will be the enterprises which\nbetter organize and coordinate the cooperative partnership\nso as to provide the better, the faster, and the closer\nservice to the end users through the supply chain network.\n2.3. Complexity Analysis of the Agile Supply Chain Network\n2.3.1. Integration Complexity. Synergy function in the organizational\nand themanagerial activities is themost frequent one\nin the agile supply chain network. Collaborative requirements\nare the highest ones; the emergence phenomenon is the\nmost significant. Therefore, integration complexity is mainly\ndivided into organizational complexity and managerial complexity.\nThe organizational complexity is mainly influenced\nby the certainty and quantity of supply chain structure, scale,\nand internal relationship.Managerial complexity is a complex\nphenomenon in the supply chain design, adjustment, reengineering,\nand management process.\n2.3.2. Operational Complexity. Operational process of the\nagile supply chain network is the process of dynamic management\nof the connection, the distribution, the layout, the\ngoal, and so forth among the various elements, is the process\nof planning and coordinating information, nodes, paths, and\ntechnologies needed by supply chain, and is the collaborative\nprocess of planning and utilizing all kinds of soft resource.\nIt reflects dynamic complexity of the agile supply chain\nnetwork.\n2.3.3. Manufacturing Complexity. Manufacturing complexity\nin the agile supply chain network refers to some nonlinear\nand unpredictable phenomena emerging in the process of\nproduct design and production.\n2.3.4. Environmental Complexity. Environmental changes\nwill lead to the corresponding changes in the agile supply\nchain network. The speed and the extent of environmental\nchanges may cause the unpredictable changes of the internal\nfactors of the agile supply chain network and cause quantity\nand quality relationship among elements to produce the\ncorresponding nonlinear changes, eventually leading to the\nincreased complexity of the agile supply chain network.\n3. Evolutionary Mechanism of Agile Supply\nChain Network Based on Complex Network\nTheory and Simulation Analysis\n3.1. EvolutionaryMechanism. The agile supply chain network\ncan be described as a set𝐺 = (𝑁, 𝐸), which contains member\nenterprises (𝑁) and a group of edges with weight (𝐸). The\nweighted adjacency matrix 𝑊 is used to delegate the agile\nsupply chain network. Matrix element 𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n≥ 0) represents\naverage business response speed between enterprise 𝑖\nand enterprise 𝑗. 𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n= 0means that there is no business link\nbetween enterprise 𝑖 and enterprise 𝑗. Because of bidirectional\nnature of logistics flow, capital flow, and information flow\nin business activities, it is assumed that agile supply chain\nnetwork is undirected network.\nDefinition 1. The node strength of node enterprise 𝑖, 𝑠\n𝑖\n, is\n𝑠\n𝑖\n= ∑\n𝑗∈𝑁𝑖\n𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n. (7)\n𝑁\n𝑖\nrefers to the nearest neighbor set of node enterprise\n𝑖. The node strength not only considers the number of the\nnearest neighbors of node enterprise but also considers the\nweights of business links between this enterprise and its\nnearest neighbors and is the integrated embodiment of local\ninformation of this node enterprise.\nDefinition 2. The distance between node enterprise 𝑖 and\nnode enterprise 𝑗 can be expressed as\n𝐿\n𝑖𝑘\n=\n𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n+ 𝑤\n𝑗𝑘\n𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n𝑤\n𝑗𝑘\n. (8)\n', 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering 5\nTable 1: Statistical criteria of choosing partners of Chinese enterprises.\nSelection criteria Quality Price Delivery\nlead time\nVariety\nflexibility\nLead time and\nprice compromise\nLead time and batch\ncompromise\nPercentage (%) 98.5 92.4 69.7 45.5 30.3 21\nLet 𝑙\n𝑖𝑘\n= 1/𝐿\n𝑖𝑘\n= 𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n𝑤\n𝑗𝑘\n/(𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n+ 𝑤\n𝑗𝑘\n). In the formula,\nthe node enterprise 𝑖 makes connection with node 𝑗 and\nnode 𝑘 by means of two edges with weight of 𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\nand 𝑤\n𝑗𝑘\n,\nrespectively. We can obtain the distance between any two\nnode enterprises based on the formula and further get the\nshortest distance between anymember enterprises in the agile\nsupply chain network and the average shortest distance of the\nagile supply chain network.\nDefinition 3. The definition of clustering coefficient of node\nenterprise 𝑖 is\n𝐶\n𝑤\n𝐻,𝑖\n=\n∑\n𝑗,𝑘\n𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n𝑤\n𝑗𝑘\n𝑤\n𝑘𝑖\nmax\n𝑗\n(𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n)∑\n𝑗,𝑘\n𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n𝑤\n𝑘𝑖\n. (9)\nCombine these three basic concepts coming from the\nweighted network evolutionmodel with the unique attributes\nof the agile supply chain network evolution; we can get the\nrule of evolution of edge weight in the agile supply chain\nnetwork model.\nEdge weight evolves in accordance with the processed\nbusiness volume per unit time between node enterprises\n(response speed); the newly added business volume per unit\ntime transforms to edge weight conversely and drives the\nnetwork evolution again.\nThe basic evolution mechanism of the agile supply chain\nnetwork model is shown as the follows:\n(1) Evolution stems from the complete network with 𝑚\n0\nnode enterprises. The weight of each edge is initialized to\n𝑤\n𝑖𝑗\n= 𝑓(0).\n(2) At the 𝑡 time step, add a new node enterprise 𝑛 into the\nnetwork, this new node makes connection with𝑚 (𝑚 ≤ 𝑚\n0\n)\nold nodes, and the weight of link is 𝑔(𝑡). The probability of\nthe new node linking with node 𝑖 is shown as\nΠ\n𝑛→ 𝑖\n= 𝑝\n𝑠\n𝑖\n∑\n𝑗\n𝑠\n𝑗\n+ (1 − 𝑝)\n𝑙\n𝑛𝑖\n∑\n𝑗\n𝑙\n𝑛𝑗\n. (10)\n𝑠\n𝑖\nis the node strength of node 𝑖 and 𝑙\n𝑛𝑖\nthe reciprocal of\nthe shortest distance between node 𝑛 and node 𝑖; that is\n𝑙\n𝑛𝑖\n= 1/𝐿\n𝑛𝑖\n. 𝑝 is the factor of proportionality. This formula\nillustrates that the new node makes connection with the\nexisting nodes under the premise of taking into account the\nresponse speed which reflects the business processing ability\nper unit time, the node with the faster response speed is\npreferred, and at the same time, taking into account the\naverage shortest path distance between the node preparing\nto be linked and the new one, the node with closer distance is\npreferred.\n(3) The formula of edge weight evolution is\n𝑓 (𝑡) = 𝑓 (𝑡 − 1) + 𝑔 (𝑡) . (11)\n(4) The factor of proportionality is 𝑝.\nAccording to the survey data given by the supply chain\nmanagement research group in School of Management,\nHuazhongUniversity of Science&Technology,whenChinese\nenterprises choose partners, the factors considered by them\nare shown as in Table 1.\nSeparate delivery lead time, price compromise, and batch\ncompromise being relatedwith lead time from the factors and\ncalculate the ratio of the sum of three factors to the sum of all\nfactors. The ratio can be the factor of proportionality (1 − 𝑝)\nwhich reflects time influence of the average shortest path and\nthen get 𝑝 = 0.72.\n3.2. SimulationAnalysis. WeuseMatlabR2014a software.The\ncomputer is configured as AMD processor. The dominant\nfrequency is 2.50GHz. Set 𝑚\n0\n= 10, 𝑚 = 3, 𝑝 = 0.72,\nand the network size 𝑁 = 1000; the processed business\nvolume per unit time (edge weight) can be set randomly. The\nevolution stems from the agile supply chain network with\n10 node enterprises, each one of which makes business with\nall other node enterprises. In other words, this network is\na complete network. The newly added node connects with\nthree old nodes in the network. Evolution scale grows up\nto the 1000 nodes in the network. Observe the relationship\nbetween the network size with degree distribution, average\nshortest distance, clustering coefficient, and node betweenness.\n3.2.1. Degree Distribution. Simulation results in Figure 2\nshow that the curve of degree distribution possesses the\nfeature of power law distribution, and most nodes have small\ndegree value; only few nodes have big degree value.There are\nseldom nodes whose degree value falls in the interval (10, 18);\ntheir emergency probability is very low.There aremany nodes\nwhose degree value falls in the interval (0, 10), and emergency\nprobability is high. These features illustrate that the model\ncan obviously reflect the scale-free feature of the agile supply\nchain network.\n3.2.2. Average Shortest Distance Distribution. Figure 3 shows\nthat the average path length between node enterprises in\nthe agile supply chain network grows with the growth of\nnetwork size, but the total length is not large. It is related\nwith virtuality of dynamic association in the agile supply\nchain network. In the sense of dynamic association, the nodes\nconstantly reconfigure cooperative relationships between\nthemselves according to the business demand in the internal\n', '6 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nD\neg\nre\ne v\nal\nue\n200 400 600 800 10000\nCode of node\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nD\neg\nre\ne v\nal\nue\n200 400 600 800 10000\nCode of node\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\n200 400 600 800 10000\nCode of node\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nD\neg\nre\ne v\nal\nue\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\nNetwork size: 1000 nodes Network size: 1000 nodes\nNetwork size: 1000 nodes Network size: 1000 nodes\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nD\neg\nre\ne v\nal\nue\n200 400 600 800 10000\nCode of node\n(a)\n10\n−3\n10\n−2\n10\n−1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\n10\n0\nk\nNetwork size: 1000 nodes\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\nP\n(k\n)\n(b)\nFigure 2: Degree distribution.\n', 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering 7\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nAv\ner\nag\ne s\nho\nrt\nes\nt d\nist\nan\nce\n10\n1\n10\n3\n10\n2\nNetwork size\nFigure 3: Average shortest distance distribution.\nm = 3\n0.16\n0.18\n0.2\n0.22\n0.24\n0.26\n0.28\n0.3\n0.32\n0.34\nCl\nus\nte\nrin\ng \nco\neffi\nci\nen\nt\n100 200 300 400 5000\nNetwork size\nFigure 4: Clustering coefficient distribution.\nand external environment in order to form the new supply\nchain network. The nodes keep close relationship with each\nother by means of information technology and information\nsystem, which leads to relatively short characteristic path\nlength.\n3.2.3. Clustering Coefficient Distribution. Figure 4 shows the\nclustering coefficient of the agile supply chain network\nfalls in the interval (0.1, 0.4). Clustering level is not high\nand gradually decreases with the growth of network size,\npresenting long tail distribution. The reason is that the agile\nsupply chain network takes on network distribution. The\nenterprises prefer to finish the business process by means\nof horizontal cooperation rather than complete all tasks by\nmeans of vertical integration. In thisway, the node enterprises\ncan utilize core competitive power fully, as well as by means\nof external resources, and enforce agility and flexibility of\nsupply chain. Thus, the agile supply chain network can\nadjust the composition of node enterprises, business progress,\nand organization structure, in order to actualize dynamic\nreconfigure of the agile supply chain network.\n3.2.4. Node Betweenness Distribution. Figure 5 shows that\nthe node betweenness value falls in the interval (0, 0.12),\nmost nodes have small betweenness value, only few nodes\nhave large betweenness value, and the curve of betweenness\ndistribution presents power law distribution. It is consistent\nwith the low clustering coefficient in the agile supply chain\nnetwork.\nThe simulation analysis of these four indicators illustrates\nthat the main statistical features of evolution mechanism of\nthe agile supply chain network can well reflect the features of\nscale-free network.\n4. Conclusions\nFrom the perspective of network structure, the paper systematically\nand dynamically analyzes the evolutionary process\nof the agile supply chain network by means of the evolution\nmechanism model, reveals agility motivation for individual\ndecision making and network characteristics of evolution\nresults in the agile supply chain network evolution, and also\nanalyzes the mechanism of making decision and action of\nindividuals in self-organization movement improving the\nagility of the whole supply chain network. This provides a\nreference for further optimization of the agile supply chain\nnetwork.\nThe paper explains the adaptability of complex network\ntheory to the research on the agile supply chain network and\nanalyzes the complexity of the agile supply chain network\nbased on the introduction of basic concepts of complex\nnetwork and agile supply chain network. Then, the paper\ndesigns the evolution mechanism model of the agile supply\nchain network based on complex network theory. In the\nevolution mechanism, node enterprise makes a decision on\nconnection according to two factors. One is the responsive\nability; the other is distance.They construct the link criterion\nof agility in the agile supply chain network. After that, the\nsimulation analysis is presented. Simulation results show\nthat the agile supply chain network obviously possesses the\nfeatures of scale-free network.\nIn the future research, we can use complex network\ntheory to study the robustness of the agile supply chain\nnetwork generated by the evolution mechanism designed by\nthe paper, which is the ability of continually maintaining\nthe operation when the supply chain network is disturbed.\nBesides, we can also make research on risk management\nconsisting of risk identification, risk diffusion, and control\nin the agile supply chain network based on the evolution\nmechanism and study the network efficiency of the agile\nsupply chain network which is generated by the evolution\nmechanism and other related fields.\nConflict of Interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\n', '8 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nBe\ntw\nee\nnn\nes\ns v\nal\nue\n200 400 600 800 10000\nCode of node\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\n0.08\n0.09\n0.1\nBe\ntw\nee\nnn\nes\ns v\nal\nue\n200 400 600 800 10000\nCode of node\nNetwork size: 1000 nodes\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\nNetwork size: 1000 nodes\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\n0.025\n0.03\n0.035\n0.04\nBe\ntw\nee\nnn\nes\ns v\nal\nue\n200 400 600 800 10000\nCode of node\nNetwork size: 1000 nodes\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\nBe\ntw\nee\nnn\nes\ns v\nal\nue\n200 400 600 800 10000\nCode of node\nNetwork size: 1000 nodes\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\n(a)\nNetwork size: 1000 nodes\nThe factor of proportionality: P = 0.72\nm = 3\n10\n−3\n10\n−2\nP\n10\n−1\n10\n0\n10\n−3\n10\n−2\n10\n−4\n10\n−1\n10\n−5\n10\n0\nBetweenness value\n(b)\nFigure 5: Node betweenness distribution.\n', 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering 9\nAcknowledgments\nThe work of Nai-Ru Xu was supported in part by the Key\nProject of the Special Foundation for Young Scientists of\nAnhui Province of China under Grant no. 2013SQRW090ZD.\nThe work of Jia-Bao Liu was supported in part by the Natural\nScience Foundation of Anhui Province of China under Grant\nno.
