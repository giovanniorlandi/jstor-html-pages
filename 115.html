H. 1059S, will be up\nin the lower house of congress for\na vote some time next week, accord\ning to word received from Congress\nman Samuel S- Arentz by The Silver\nState. Postmaster General\nHubert\nWork has made an exhaustive\nreport to the committee having\ncharge of the proposed federal law\nand the national association of se\ncurities commissioners, meeting in\nLincoln, Neb , a few weeks ago, en\ndorsed the Denison proposal without\na dissenting voice. Whatever pro\ntests are filed from this state should\ngo forward promptly to Nevada\'s con\ngressional delegation by wire, ad\nvises Congressman Arentz. who is\naltogether alive to tho significance\nof the provisions of the bill, but\ncannot encompass its defeat without\naid.\nThe proposal, enacted into law,\nlvill prove one of tbe most geriolla\n1 ...,.. jnfij,.,p,i neainst this state In\na generation, forbidding as it will,\nhe several activities constituting,\nunder normal conditions, legitimate\nmining promotion. Blue sky laws\nhave been put into effect in many\nstates, yet investment in bona fide\nNevada offerings\' has continued. The\nproposed federal law would preclude\ntho use of the mails in an inter\nstate sense for mining exploitation\nand forbid the transportation of\nstock certificates through the mails\nor by any public carrier. In short,\nthe man in New York desiring to\ninvest in a Nevada mine would have\nto come or send an agent to this\nstate to complete the transfer and\naccept its evidence in stock. There\nis no doubt that mining investment\nwould still be made within this state\nby people living in other places,\niespite the enactment of the Deni\nson bill into law, yet the mining\npromoter would be seriously ham\npered in his activities and many\npromising mining properties in this\nstate would languish.\nIt would be only a step from\namending the Denison proposal,\nonce enacted Into law, to make it\na felony for a person to be found\nwith mining stock in their posses\nsion, in which event mining activi\nties will become as clandestine In\ncharacter as bootlegging.\nArrayed in favor of the passage\nof the Denison bill are powerful\neastern Interests that are strongly\ncommitted to the strictures against\nwestern mines and are working un\nremittingly for the new legislation.\nUTILITY PROPERTY\nSOLD AT AUCTION\n(fly Aaaoofateil Preaa)\nGREENVILLE.

Wein\nberg on a cross examination before\nthe committee, declared that he\nwould express his opinion on politi\ncal and economic one.-! ions at any\ntime ami in any place despite the\nSupreme Court of the t\'nited States.\nIf that were the only offense of men\nwho have been convicted under the\nespionage act they wnu\'.d never have\nbeen haled before a run:-! of Justice.\nThe so-calied political prisoners\nwere not convicted for expressing\ntheir opinions on political and eco\nnomic questions. They were con\nvicted for imerfurring with the pros\necution of the war or for giving aid\nand comfort to our national ene\nmies The author of the resolution was\nRepresentative London, socialist of\nNew York. At the hearing before\nthe congressional committee Mr,\nLondon declared that he would free\nmen convicted of violence if they\ndid so because of a deep religious\nfeeling. If that theory of the admin,\nistration of our criminal laws should\nbe adopted Booth and Guitean would\nhave escaped punishment if they had\nput up the plea that they assassin\nated presidents of the United States\nunder tha impulse of deep religious\nfeeling. Under our conscription laws\nno man was required to bear arms\nif he could show that he had religi\nous convictions against war. Many\nmen undertook to take advantage\nof the provisions of that law not\nwithstanding they had never there\ntofore shown any religious convic\ntions on war or any other subject\nThe only complaint that was heard\nof the administration of the con\nscientious objection provision of the\nlaw was that the war department\nconstrued It too liberally and per\nmitted many persons to escape their\nobligations under the conscription\nact.\nThe fact that the war is now over\nis cited by some as a reason why\nthe offenders under the espionage\nlaw should be given their freedom\nThe fallacy of such a plea as that\nis readily apparent. The was was\nwon not through their efforts, hut\nin spite of ther opposition. If it\nwas ever proper to deprive them of\ntheir freedom it would certainly be\nimproper now to let them enjoy the\nfruits of a victory in which they\nhad no part but which they tried to\nprevent.\nSHOULD SUPPORT ALL\nECONOMY MEASURES\nLfit the economy program in con\ngress continue. Let everybody at\nhome give moral support to Con\nnecticut\'s congressmen and sena\ntors, that pace may not slacken.\nLeaders of the house have a short\ntime ago issued an appeal for pub\nlic support in such a program. Rep\nresentative Fess has issued a warn\ning that the "contemplated saving\nof several hundred millions of dol\nlars through the limitation of arma\nments will result in hundreds of at\ntempted raids on the public treas\nury with freak legislation." Con\ngress will have to be on its guard\nto forestall such legislation.\nDespite criticism, the present con\ngress has accomplished a great deal\nafter being handed the broken down\nInefficient, ramshackle machinery\nleft by the democrats. Everything\ncannot be done in a day, and for\naction, the present congress has ac\ncomplished more for the time it has\nbeen in session than any previous\ncongress-\nNow let\'s make certain that par\ntisanship or personal desires on the\npart of some people do not inter\nfere with the economy program.\nCongress has already cut hundreds\nof millions of dollars from previous\nexpenditures. Already tho clans are\ngathering in Washington and bring\ning pressure to bear upon individ\nual members of congress to support\nthis, that or the other fad or pet\nmeasure, every one ot which means\nthe expenditure of some money.\nIn addition to these influences,\n: there are some 200-odd bureaus,\nmany of which are not necessary,\nwhich are insistent upon being al\nlowed to continue. They are bring\ning a great pressure to hear on in\ndividual members of congress to\ncontinue their appropriations. Many\nof them could go, some are neces\nsary. All of them have the hnck-\n! ing of some class or clique or "inove-\nI ment." They are now going to rely\non getting enough sentiment behind\nthem to stay sentiment which will\nnot array itself against their con\ntinuation. It is the old story of organized\nmovement. A congressman after all\nis but human, and after being be\nsieged day and night in behalf of\nsniiiit particular measure calling for\nappropriations of this much and that\n\' much, is liab\'.e to lend his support\ni to the proposition when he sees no\nhacking from his constituency or\nthe press "back home"\nIf the republican press of Con\nnecticut, coupled with the support\nof interested republican citizens of\nthe state, will back up Connecticut\'s\nI representatives in congress, un\ndoubtedly Connecticut, can be in\nthe forefront when the nation be\ngins to plan further reduction in\nI taxation and a lessening of the bur\ndens now carried over from the\nwar.\nEUROPE WILL ERECT\nSOLDIER MONUMENTS\nThe president, at the request of\nthe secretary of war, has recom\nmeiulo:l to the congress legislation\nproviding for the creation of a bat\ntle monuments commission.

S. Engineers\nfought at Canibrai, after the British\n! lines had been broken and held the\nGermans in check until the British\nand French brought up reinforce\nments; sector where the 6th U. S.\nEngineers held the Germans in\ncheck, March 21, 1918; sectors mark\ning the location of the 369th. 370th,\n371st, 372"d regiments, which were\nbrigaded with the French troops;\nsplit near Casarsa, Italy, where the\n332d U. 8. infantry was engaged.\nIn addition to these special monu\nments, bronze tablets will be placed\nmarking certain buildings of Inter\nest in connection with the American\nforces in Franca Outline map mon\numents will be erected showing, for\nmer positions of American troops\nin the battle sectors. These monu\nments will be in the form of relief\nmaps and will show in colored en\namel battle front lines and numbers\nof American troops engaged.

The discovery of\npromising goldlode Is announced by\nthe owners of the Golden Crescent\ngroup of four claims in the Reserva\ntion district, three miles west of\nReservation station, on the Mina\nbranch of the Southern Pacific rail\nroad, and about 18 miles east of\nYerington. Shoots of high grade\nore and large ledges of milling\nquartz have been exposed in a huge\nporphyritic dyke which lies between\nwalls of altered granite and lime.\nOne shoot three inches wide at the\nsurface has Increased to a width of\nmore than 30 Inches at a depth of\n30 feet with the ore assaying $32 to\n$530 from surface to shaft bottom.\nAnother 12-inch shoot at surface\nsamples $150, with a drill hole 12\nInches from surface penetrating the\nshoot for a width of more than 18\ninches with assays running from\n$161 to $425. Numerous panning3\nalong the dyke, which is capped by\nan average of IS Inches of lime,\nBhows ore estimated to range from\n$300 to $700 a ton. An assay taken\nacross a 14-foot ledge averaged $6.50,\nand another five-foot width sampled\n$7.25.\nThe dyke has an average width\nof fully 200 feet and has been traced\nfor about a mile, traversing the Ila\'.f\nMoon and No. 2 claims of the Golden\nCrescent, the adjoining No. 1 claim\nof the Money-Maker group, and con\ntinuing into the Packsaddle property.\nIt has been exposed for a width ap\nproximating 130 feet near the cen\nter of the Half Moon claim, and the\ngold bearing area demonstrated for\nan approximate length of 1500 foet.\nThe owners are engaged in remov\ning the capping at this point, pre\nliminary to comprehensive develop\nment and opening of areas to leas\ners. The Golden Crescent and\nMoney Maker properties are con\ntrolled by W. F. Casson and asso\nciates of Carson City.\nMining men who have examined\nthe property pronounce the discov\nery of Importance to Nevada. The\ndistrict Is five hours by rail from\nReno and about six hours by rail\nfrom Tonopah. The strike has stirred\nmuch interest and a stampede to the\nfield is forecasted.\nt .- EV\nt : I\ntf9 I\nat 5\n.... .\nr\'usliinn still puts striped materials\nIn tlie loud fur sports skirts, but they\nluive some cinp\'tlt!in in plaid anil\ncheeked patterns in all skirt materials\nChecks with f ringed edges, are renil\nnioent of shawls und they make many\nof tho smart new models in which\nthe frlngle Is substituted for a Item at\nthe bottom of the skirt and also finish\nes the patch pockets. A skirt of tills\nkind appears in the picture above,\ncut on simple lines and having a sep\narate belt of the mnterial. These\nfringed materials are particularly\nsmart In the new wrapped skirts with\nthe fringed edge arranged to run from\nbelt to hem.\nSport skirts and street skirts are a\nlittle longer than they were, the regu\nlation length being from six to eight\nInches from the Moor.

As I pointed the cor\nrect directions she fell In a faint,\nright Into my arms. I was badly con\nfused and started to carry her to one\nof the platforms In the center of the\nImmense coliseum. Then I heard roars\nof loud laughter. I dropped her and\nstarted to fan her with my hat, when,\nwith all eyes on me, 1 realized that\nthe young "lady" was a clown who\nhad been amusing the audience before\nthe start of the regular show und I\nwas the "goat." Exchange.\nHorseshoe From the Prince.\nBefore embarking for India \' the\nprince of Wales visited the castle of\nOakham In Rutland, says au English\nexchange.\nAnd following an old tradition lfle\nhad to pay the tithe.\nThis tradition, over 300 years old, Is\none of the most curious. It imposes\nupon the visitor of note for whom\nalone the gates are opened the obli\ngation to offer a horseshoe.\nThe prince of Wales did not ignore\nthis custom. His horseshoe was\nplaced above the first that figured In\nthe collection, and which was received\nfrom the hands of Queen Elizabeth.\n"Telcgraphone" May Bs Used in the\nFuture to Prevent Possibility of\nUnhappy Marriage.\nOne of the Innumerable uses to\nwhich the "telcgraphone," an Inven\ntion announced by the Society of Elec\ntrical iH\'veloi\'iiiciit, may be placed Is\nthat of preventing unhappy marriages\nThe Inventor himself, name not ills\nclosed, believes that If It can be ail\nJusted over the heart of the girl, her\ndoubt-torn swain will he aide to tell\nwhether she Is telling the truth or not.\nUe had not invented a way of making\nthe girl put this lie detector on.\nThe "telcgraphone" records the\nbreathing ami heart beats. It magni\nfies Irregularities caused by emotions\nand Is regarded by erliiiiii"lo;;ists as a\nsure method of catching lying wit\nnesses. The lover suggestion is put\nforward by the inventor merely as an\nexample of what science could do II\npermitted.\n"When John grows doubtful of the\nreality of Joan\'s love for him," he\nsays In his dry, academic way, "he i\ncan satisfy himself by having her\nheart flutters measured."\nIf the girl puts up a struggle at a !\nsuggestion that she wear this bar-\nness during an evening of courtship j\nJohn may be sure that he Is going to\nget several hours of lies. In that case\nthere is nothing to do but doubt every\nthing she says. Thus will unhappy i\nmarr ages be prevented. j\nWhen The Bonanza says jod print\ning, it means that and nothing else.\nWe have the finest equipped Job\nprinting plant in the state.\nSUPERSTITION\nBABY\'S TEETH\nmm\nnmmi\n(By Associated Press)\nLONDON, April 1 Strange super\nstitutoins such as belief that the ap\npearance of a baby\'s first teeth on\nthe upper jaw was an Ill-omen to\nthe community and that it had, there\nfore to be murdered, were described\nby Dr- M. Horn, councillor ot state\nfor Belgium, in an address here on\n"Bolgian colonial administration in\nthe Congo."\nThis practice, as well as others,\nlike mutilation and cannibalism, is\nnow punishable by law.\nThe law also interfered, he said,\nwith native matrimonial customs.\nWhile a man may accpiire a wife\neither by means of a dowry paid to\nIter family, by inheritance, purchase,\nexchange or force of arms, no legal\nbond is deemed to exist between the\nalleged husband and the woman ac\nquired without her consent.\nAcquisition by means of a dowry\nIs recognized In principle, but the\nsecond, third, etc., wife will be per\nmitted to desert her husband, the\nstate being prepared to refund tha\ndowry If no other man hag been the\ncause of her desertion. No com\npensation will be paid when the hus\nband has been warned In due time\nas to the precarious nature of his\nrights in regard to "his new better\nfraction."\nDr. Horn said a large proportion\nof the Congo population was pitiably\nunderfed and for this state of af\nfairs European rule was partly re\nsponsible.
