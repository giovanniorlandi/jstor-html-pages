The low is, estimated at $l,5oo,ooo, with insurance, at $385,ooo., The lire started just before 11 p. ra., Sunday, and was not under control un, til 4:30 u. m. Sunday. It was caused, by alighted candle coming in contact, with loose wall paper in Burchard's, store, a two-story frame building on, South Montezuma street. The lire, quickly spread to the Scopel building,, a four-story stone and brick ud joining,, and then to the numerous frame shacks, in its rear and running back toGranite, street. These were quickly licked up, by the lire., From Granite street the (ire swept, north and spread east to Montezuma, street and the famou Whisky Row., There was absolutely no water pressure, and dynamite was resorted to. Many, buildings were blown up before the, flames reached the Burke hotel on the, corner of Montezuma and Gurley, xtreets, but without avail., The stationary house of Kelley &, Stevens stood on the corner opposite, the Hotel Burko. When it was seen, that the flumes would keep on north,, the Kelley it Stevens establishment, was dynamited, but the fire only scat, tered.

Next came the great B ash ford, Burmister company's mercantile estab, lishment with its quarter million stock,, and the entire block to Cortez street, was burned.
