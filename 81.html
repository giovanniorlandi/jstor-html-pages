This ditch empties into the larg\ner, or what is known as the railroad\nditch, which runs through that end of\ntown and empties into the Carson\nriver.\nThe point at which these sewers\nemptied into Tar ditch was just north\nof the Virginia and Truckee round\nhouse, and for that section of Carson\nnorth of Ann, Sophia and Williams\nstreets emptied into the same ditch\nabout 700 feet below the round house.\nThis ditch is small and at no time\ndid it carry off the sewage, rather did\nit remain almost at a standstill and\nbecome clogged with sand, weeds and\ntubbish, until in the summer time the\nstench arising from it was almost un\nbearable and its poisonous gases filled\nthe air. Ai a matter of fact there\nwere more cases of typhoid fever in\nthat section of the town than any\nother, due, no doubt, to the unsani\ntary methods of disposition of sew\nage. The new sewer just being com\npleted will prevent any such condi\ntios in the future.

All the\nsewers that formerly emptied into the\nold Tar ditch are now connected up\nwith this new system, and the bene\nficial result will be noticeable at once.\nThe unhealthful conditions exist\ning has made that section less desir\nable for residence, but, as a result of\nthe improvements property values\nshould increase and the north and\ncast end of Carson become a more\nhealthy and desirable residence dis\ntrict. Both the Board of City Trustees\nand the management of the Virginia\nand Truckee railroad are to be com\nmended for their efforts in improv\ning the sanitary condition of Carson.\nThe work has been expensive, but\nthey both believe the health of the\npeop\'e fully justified the expenditure\nof the money.\n-oo-\nJury Brings In\nVerdict Not Guilty\n- The Manfrina case, which has been\non trial before Judge Langan at Min\n!en since Monday morning, was con\ncluded yesterday.

This is because a recent survey of the water and\nfire fighting facilities disclosed the fact that Carson was so well protected\nagainst . lire, by reason of the high pressure on its water mains and an\nefficient fire department, that under the rule of the San Francisco Board\nof Underwriters this city is entitled to a. lower rate..\nSome years ago a similar survey was made of the city of Reno and\nit resulted in a substantial reduction f rates. It was discovered that\nthe property owners of Reno had been paying a higher rate than was war\nrented simply because no one had moved in the matter of a survey of the\nwater facilities and an investigation of the fire fightmg appliances 01\nthe town.\nUnder the present law the insurance commissioner is required to\nmake a survey of the fire fighting appliances of any town in the state on\na petition of a certain .percentage of the property owners. But these peti\ntions never materialize from the fact that not one person in a hundred\nknows of the existence of such a law.\nIt might be well for the incoming legislature to give the insurance\ncommissioner, on his own volition, the power to make a fire survey of\nthe various towns of the state above a certain size, with a view of making\nthe proper showing to the San Francisco Board of Underwriters and\nsecuring proper reductions. The expense could easily be met by the\nproperty owners of the towns securing the reduction. The survey made\nat Reno about ten years ago cost but a few hundred dollars and has saved\nthe property owners many thousands. The fire insurance (companies are\nfavorable to this course and are always willing to encourage it. Their\nreduced rate is a premium on preparedness.\n00\nDRAMATIZING THEIR IMMATURITY\nNothing so annoys the suffragists says the New York Times, as to\nbe told that the quality of the feminine mind has anything to do with the\nquestion. Nothing so moves them to indignant speech as to hear ft\nalleged that the introduction of the female mind into politics will not im\nprove that science. Then, by way of discomfiting the argument, they pro\nceed to furnish gratuitous demonstrations of its truth.\nSome things are called "characteristically feminine" which are, in\ntruth, only characteristically human. But certainly no aggregation of\nmale minds, even if carefully selected because of their smallness and\n" cheapness, would ever think of anything so supremely small and cheap as\nthe unfurling of the banner bearing the words: "Mr. President, what will\nyou do for woman suffrage?" before his eyes as he arose in the TiaTl of\nrepresentatives to, inform the congress of the state of the nation. One\nwould be justified in calling that exhibition "characteristically feminine"\neven if the phrase were unjustified in nine other cases out of ten, simply\nbecause its peculiar compound of qualities could never be found in any\npolitical performance by any group of males. If there was one quality\napparently left out, its omission was instantly supplied by the breathless\nirruption into the press gallery, simultaneously with the unfurling of the\ns banner, of a messenger with a hundred mimeographed copies of a state\nment giving the names of the women guilty of the performance, and a\nstatement in the first person by the femaleorganizer -of the assault on\ngood taste.\nMembers of congress frojn the women suffrage states privately de\nplored the incident. If they really desire to see the glories of their sys\ntem extended to other states, we do not wonder. Those glories will\nnever be extended if the voters in those other states continue to be of\nfended and disgusted by exhibitions of childishness like this. This par\nticular exhibition almost seems to have been designed by some enemy 01\nsuffrage intent on spectacularly proving the worst that has been said about\nthe puerility of the suffragist mind.\n00\nTHE RISE IN SILVER\nThe steady advance in the price of silver, while not attracting so\nmuch attention as have the sensational rises in the baser metals, is a mat\nter of utmost importance to . the financial world and particularly to the\nmen of the west where so many great silver producing smines are located.\nStocks representing these mines have not experienced, says Goodwin\'s\nWeekly, a strong enough movement during the rise in the price of the\nmetal, probably because that rise has been so gradual, but when the public\n13 fully cognizant of what will be necessary in the readjustment of the\nmonetary situation all over the world later on, or in other words, wtien\nthe war is at an end, we believe in common with market students that\nthere will be a boom in silvcrstocks entirely separate from that which\nhas affected securities in any other distinctive class.\nThe longer the war goes on the greater is the possibility of the re\nmonetization of silver. There has tlready been a large absorption of sil\nver for coinage purposes due to the withdrawal of gold from circulation\nby the Allies, and financiers seem agreed that there is a strong probability\nof it becoming a question with all the powers embroiled abroad of repud\niating their international obligations if the great nations of the world do\nnot remonetize silver or accept it on a fixed basis at a much higher value\nthan the present price of the metal. There is no discounting the import\nance of the position of silver in the world of finance today? and with its\nstrength assured it will again be a most important factor in the prosperity\nof the entire country and particularly the western states. Surely the out\nlook for metal mining in the west for 1917 is most propitious.\n00\n\' WORLD NEEDS MORE WOOL\nThe world needs more wool to clothe its increasing population, and\nconsequently more sheep, was the statement made a few days ago by Al\nbert W. Elliott of Boston at the tenth annual meeting of the American\nAssociation bf Woolen and Worsted Manufacturers in New York City.\nIt was sh-own Jhat last year the United States raised and imported\n800,000,000 pounds of wool, and exported nearly $60,000,000 worth of wool\nmanufa"Ctureres. Both Great Britain and the United States, it was stated,\nhad enormously increased their jyool consumption since the war began.\nAccording-to Mr. Elliott, there are in the world today about 634,000,000\nsheep, mroducting 2,836,000,000 pounds of wool a year.\nPresident Robert T. Frances, in his annual" address, complained that\nthe public, while willing to pay advances on food and other necessities,\nfailed to . assent to paying proportionately more for clothing, . notwith\nstanding the mounting costs of production. Both ".clothing manufacturers"\nand retailers, he said, had encouraged the public in the matter of "fixed\nprices" for suits. If these fixed prices cannot be done away with, Mr.\nFrancis said, the public must expect poorer materials and less wear. -\nDr. William Beckers of Brooklyn said the manufacture of dyes and\nchemicals in the United States should be encouraged and pointed to Ger:\nmany approving the wisdom of having a great chemical industry which\ncould be turned overnightJo the government for the manufacture of ex\nplosives. The Allies, he said, were far behind Germany, while America\nhad been left high and dry in the chemical line although American manu\nfacturers had taken hold of the situation in a phenomenal manner.\n-00\nAbout all we hear of these days is the high cost of foodstuffs and\ncommodoties, but has anybody heard anything of the scarcity of those\narticleso long as he has the price to buy? The grocer don\'t seem to be\nshy on eggs or butter or the shoe man his usual stock of shoes. " They\nare always obtainable if you have the wherewithal.\n00\nIt sounds good to be told that if you save your old newspapers they\nwill bring $10 or $12 a ton, but when you figure out that it costs you $5\nor $6 a ton to get them to a given point, besides the cost of gathering\nthem, you begin to wonder where you are going to get off.\n00\nThe members of the incoming legislature will not be burdened with\nthe job of providing situations for relatives as attaches. The nepotism\nbill passed two years ago has relieved them of that worry and arfnoyance.\n\' 00\nThe Appeal has received its regular monthly "confidential price list"\nannouncing another raise in the price of .paper. If this thing keeps up\nit will pay publishers to issue their editions on ca\'ico.\nCLEARANCE SALE\nI will have a clearance sale on all\nwinter-hats at clearance prices. Also\na special sale on all coats and suits.\nWhat could be a better Xmas pres\nent than one of these splendid\nChristmas bargains at Mrs. Ed\nSweletlands, 112 W. 2nd St., dl2-tf\nNOTICE\nA meeting of the State Board of\nMedical Examiners will be held in\nCarson City Thursday, December\n21, 1916, for the transaction of such\nbusiness as may come before it.\nd7-2aw2vv S.

Clyde Tilford, who has been leas\ning mining property at Hamilton for\nsome time past, recently discovered\nthree complete volumes of the Min\ning and Scientific Press for the years\nof 1876, 1877 and 1878, in a cellar con\nnected wit,h a cabin which he occu\npies at the old town of Treasure City.\nThe numbers are all in good condi\ntion. He also found a copy of the\nWhite Pine News, then published at\nCherry Creek, dated April 4, 1885,\nwhich contains the names of several\ncitizens who are still living in this\nsection. At that time Jewett W.\nAdams was governor of the state,\nwhile A. D. Campton was auditor and\nrecorder of White Pine county and\nW. C. Gallagher .county commission\ner. In Cherry Creek township H. A.\nComiiis was on the board of school\ntrustees, while John Weber was serv\ning as justice of the peace. The paper\nmentions that Dr. Campbell, recently\nelected senator from Lincoln county,\nwas recovering from a severe spell oi\nsickness. At that time the saloon\nmen were considerably agitated over\nthe enactment of an anti-treating law,\nwhich had been signed by Governor\nAdams, and through their organiza\ntion they prepared a blacklist of all\nSkating One of\nCarson\'s Diversities\nSkating is fine sport these moon\nlight nights and the ice pond at\nBlackwell\'s ranch is thronged nightly\nwith merry parties enjoying this\nsport.

It is the fad in\nCarson now.\nDid you ever go skating and break\nthrough the ice, fall in ami get wet\nthrough and through? If you never\ndid, then you have missed some of\nthe enjoyment of life. Ask Ed Mau\nley, Fred Adamson, Elinor Yerington\nor Mrs. Morgan about it; they can in\nterest you with a story.\nThe homes of some of Carson\'s res\nidents on last Monday night about\nmidnight presented a scene similar\nto a first-class laundry, where numer\nous unmentionables were hanging on\nchairs drying out, and the owners\nwere hugging stoves following suit\nand warming up prior to retiring for\nthe night. Skating has its drawbacks,\nbut this is not one of them, the in\nability to procure a pair of skates be\ning the chief one.\noo\nIvory Engraved Free\nGolden\'s Jewelry store has a fine\nstock of French Ivory pieces to se\nlect from.

An\nitem in the same issu-: of the New\ncontains . an account of "How Bor\nHammill Was Caught In His Owfi\nNet." Bob, it seems, was the author\nof the anti-treating law, and while a\ngang of the boys were playing freeze\nout for the drinks in a saloon at\nEureka, one of them suggested that\nthey give Bob a serenade. They all\nquietly betook themselves to Bob\'s\nresidence . where they sang "Climb\ning Up the Golden Stairs." Bob was\nso charmed with the vocal selection\nthat he immediately asked the boys to\n"join him in a little something to\ntake," so they adjourned to a nearby\nsaloon, and- after refreshing, them\nselves at .Bob\'s expense, he was im\nmediately placed under arrest for vio\nlating his own anti-treating law, for\nwhich -crime he was given the limit\nin the way of a fine by the justice of\nthe peace.
