The dome needs im\nprovement; that goes without saying, and its interior should not be\nused for a storehouse. It should be remodeled and put in shape to\nreceive visitors and an elevator run to it from the lower floor of the\nbuilding in order that the laborious, tiresome climb now necessary to\nreach it may be done away with. The present windows and frame\nwork should be removed and new ones substituted so that a clear un\nobstructed view can be had. And mentioning the view that is seen\nfrom the dome, where is there anything equal to it? It is one of the\nfirst things that should be shown the visitor when he arrives in the\ncity and after viewing it he could only take away with him favor\nable and lasting impressions.\nDo not remove the dome; remodel it, or, at least, give it a new\ncoat of paint.\n00\nREPUBLICAN EFFRONTERY\nLODGE\'S TRIBUTE NOT TO W.

He had nearly completed the work when his col\nleagues appeared in Paris, and by incautious words broke the web\nso carefully spun. Finally, boldly disregarding the\ninstructions of congress, he emerged from all complications with a\ntriumphant peace."\nIs this a tribute to Woodrow Wilson? Looks like it, doesn\'t it?\nWell, it isn \'t ! It is a portion of a eulogy delivered by Senator Lodge\nto the memory of Benjamin Franklin for the part that the noble old\npatriot played in winding up the Revolutionary war. There are\nthose who are so keenly appreciative of humor as to consider this a\npretty good, though altogether unconscious, joke played by Senator\nLodge upon himself and his fault finding colleagues. San Francisco\nBulletin.\nt\nI\nX\nX\ng\nVIEWS OF THE PARAGRAPHERS\nIn a recent speech in Philadelphia, Representative Gillett of\nMassachusetts, whom the Republicans have chosen for speaker, called\nPresident Wilson a dreamer and an idealist. More than that, Mr.\nGillett said the president "is an egoist; he is not a man of practical\naffairs." And the Republican leader added: "The people do not\nwant a repetition of the indecision, apparent aimlessness and blun\ndering of the past few years in ashington.\nThe record of the Democratic party during the last several years\nof control will bear comparison with that set up by the Republicans\nwho hold the reins of government unbrokenly from 1806 to 1912.\nMr. Gillett\'s party conducted the war with Spain. As wars go,\nit wasn\'t much of a war; about 1 per cent as large an undertaking as\n\' our part in the world war, which was conducted with about 100 times\nas much efficiency.

Otto Baumgarten, professor\nof practical theology in the University of Kiel.\nProfessor Baumgarten declares that the Allies are using every\nendeavor to make the German government submit the question of\nsigning the. peace terms to the German people. .Tie fears the result.\nThe people, he says, are weary of war now, and the opportunity to\nrelieve their wants might lead them to compromise their honor and\nsell their birthright for a mess of pottage.\nThe government, it is argued, lias no right to shirk the respon\nsibility; it was elected in order to conduct the peace negotiations,\nand it must summon courage to give a definite yes or no.\nIt is true, he says, that if they refuse to sign, they may be driven\nfrom power by an infuriated and despairing people; if they do sign,\nthey will also be driven from power as soon as the people realize\nwhat the terms of peace really mean for Germany.\nBut it is their business to deeide, and it is clearly his opinion\nthat,, if they cannot modify the terms in favor of Germany, they must\ndecide in favor of signing.\nThe reverend professor\'s final, and truly German argument in\nfavcr of the government\'s signing the treaty is simple and dishonest.\nIf the government signs, the people can easily repudiate its\nsignature, but if the treaty is signed on the people\'s authority, the\nsignature will be more binding. He says:\n"But, if it is not the German people, but their government and\nelected leaders who give the decision required now, then it is possible\nto repudiate it later on; our poor nation at some subsequent period\nmay disclaim the action of its. present government and leaders as\nhaving been based on errpneous considerations; and so the decision\nto be made now would not remain valid. But if the- German people\nitself accept an vnposed and disgraceful peace now, it would have no\nfuture redress in the face of the history of the world, at councils of\nthe League of Nations or with neutrals."\nPonder the significance of this leading divine\'s advice to deal\nfraudulently in the name of honor and the peace of righteousness!\nGERMAN ULTIMATUM CAUSED WAR; NOW WHY NOT AL\nLIED ULTIMATUM FOR PEACE?\nIt is only right and just that the peace terms now submitted to\nthe Germans be in the nature of an ultimatum, says the Los Angeles\nHerald.\n"Why should the Huns be allowed to haggle further? They did\nnot wait the willingness of the remainder of the world when they\nplunged the nations into war, so why give them any too much con\nsideration as to the manner of the peace that all the other countries\nnow desire ? -\nWe hear the German complaint that the peace terms demanded\nby the Allies are impossible. That may or may not be true. But it\nis certain that many of the conditions imposed by Germany during\nthe war, of which she was the cause, also were impossible.

What some members of the joint com\nmittee on ways and means and claims o\'f both houses assert is a surpris\ning condition relative to the comparative cost of food products in Reno\nand Carson was presented by the committee\'s investigation of the cause\nof the deficiencies existing in various state departments, to take care of\nwhich a bill carrying an appropriation of over $50,000 is pending in the\nassembly.\nWhen Warden Henrich appeared before the joint committee to ex\nplain the deficiency existing in the prison fund he produced data show\ning that cost of material used in conducting the affairs of the prison\nhad advanced 40 per cent during the two-year period for which the ap\npropriations made by the legislature of 1917 were made. The warden\npurchased his supplies from Carson City merchants.\nDr. J. J. Sullivan, superintendent of the State Hospital for Mental\nDiseases, was before the committee Monday and proved to the satis\nfaction of the members of the committee that prices on supplies for his\ninstitution had increased 100 per cent during the last two years. Dr.\nCullivan explained to the committee that he purchased his supplies in\nReno.\n"I cannot see any reason for the difference in prices in Reno and\nCarson on the same commodities," said one member of the committee\nyesterday. "If anything prices in Reno should be a shade lower than in\nCarson. In all probability the prices charged the individual consumers\nin Reno would be somewhat higher than those charged Dr. Sullivan be\ncause he buys in bulk, while the individual consumer buys at retail\nprices." .\nGUESS MY PRICES MAKE A HIT EVEN IN RENO\nA.
