Instead,\nearnest effort are making to arrange 1\npreliminaries for negotiations which are I\nexpected finally to settle the Chinese\ntroubles.\nLI Hung Chang\'s message today re\nmoved perhaps the last obstacle to\na speedy beginning of these negotia\ntions, and the only doubt that now\nexists Is as to his ability to redeem\nhis pledge to protect American Inter\nests and step the outrages on mission\naries and native converts. If he can\ndo this and thus manifest the exist\nence of a de facto government, there\nis no reason to doubt that negotiations\nwill be Immediately In order.\nXotice that Russian troops will not\nevacuate Pekln until some arrange\nments have been made for the Installa\ntion of a government to take charge\nof aftulrs Is directly In line with the\naim the state department has been\npursuing In Its exchanges with LI\nHung Chang, and If this Russian de\ncision Is adhered to.

In which he\ntook special care to- thank the United\nStates government for Its attitude to\nwards the Chinese government and the\nAmerican people for what he believed\nwould prove to be "their hearty sup\nport of the government\'s attitude."\n"I hope to see Lord Salisbury on Fri\nday." said the minister, "and I trust\nthat England will see her way to agree\nto the withdrawal of her troops from\nPekln. I have had no report of Lord\nSalisbury\'s policy, but I take hope from\nthe fact that Prince Chlng has had an\nInterview with Sir Robert Hart.

Sept. 13.-A dispatch to\nthe Tribune from London says;\nThe closing scenes of the protracted\ncampaign in South Africa tend to Il\nlustrate the truth that without a neu\ntral base the Boers are helpless. If\nthe British government bad allowed\nPresident Kruger to Durcha.se Deln co.\nBay when he was anxious to do so he\nwould not now have a place of refuge\nIn the present emergency nor would his\npresence there be a source of uncertain\nty respecting the possibility of his re\nturn to the Transvaal. The purchase\nof the neutral base ten years ago would\nprobably have prevented the outbreak\nof war. "since the Boers have depended\nfrom the outset upon having the door\nopen for their own gold to go out and\nfor supplies to come In. and also upon\nhaving a bridge for retreat when they\nwere In the last ditch.\nThe news, however. 13 still .too Inde\ncisive to Justify premature talk about\na last ditch. Buller Is pressing on\nafter Potha over the mountains but\nhas captured abandoned stores rather\nthan commandoes In arms, and French\nIs still a long way from Kumalipoort.\nThe official record of the operations con\nducted by Generals Methuen, Barton\nand Hlldyard and the generals In the\nFree State proves that the territories\noccupied are swarming with guerillas\nand discontented Boers who are un\nwilling to abandon the struggle.\nThis Is one of the worst features of\nthe situation. Res?ntments caused by\nthe campaign are bitter and the oppo\nsition to British rule will have to be\nstamped out by strenuous and rigorous\nnollce work during a long period.\nThe political effect of the reports o\nPresident Kruger\'s retreat from the\nTransvaal have been Instantaneous.\nThe minors of the dissolution of par\nliament at an earlier date than pre\nvious reports have Indicated are al\nready In the air.\nEXDOP.SE BRYAX.\nAmerican Anti-Trust League If sues an\nAddress.\nCHICAGO.

Despite his cowardly flight\nfrom the scene of hostilities, the real\nratrlots continue putting up a fight\nwhich keeps the British on the run.\nGiving due allowance to natural\nfondness for the location where they\nhave long lived and labored, an out\nsider cannot but believe that the people\nof Galveston are acting unwisely In re\nbuilding their demolished city on the\nnarrow sand spit which has proven\nto dangerous a site.\nAmong the lessons of the past few\nmonths perhaps none Is more striking\nthan the way in which we have been\nforced to realize the unity of the hu\nman race. The British bayonet charge\nupon the surrendered Boers, the atro\ncities of the Russians in China, the\nlooting cf captured cities by the al\nlied forces, anl last but not least our\nown Akron and New York horrors, all\ngo to prove .that the veneer of civili\nzation is very thin over the beet of us.\nTWELVE PRESIDENTIAL TICKETS.\nChioatto Times-Herald.\nThe two million new voters of this\ncountry who will vote for president\nfor the first time this fall willl have a\ngrea\'t wealth of material from which\nto make a choice of candidates.

It is also for a\nsingle gold standard, for the merit\n85\'stem iu the public service and for the\nabolition of all "corrupting special\nprivileges, whether under the guise of\nsubsidies, bounties, undeserved pensions\nor trust-breeding tariffs."\nThe presidential tickets and parties\nnominating them are as follows:\nSOCIALIST LABOR JAN. 27.\nJob F.

Smith,\nhowever, stands firm and refuses to\nsay a word. He Is evidently an old one\nat the criminal game. Snow and Ker\nrigan have been after the men for\nsome time.

This\nsmall craft Is the tug Slocum, the\nproperty of the Quartermaster\'s de\npartment of the United State army.\nIt was found necessary to have ft\ntugboat In San Francisco harbor, and\nthe only thing the department could\ndo was to send one around from New\nYork. The Slocum, which was bought\nby the government In 1838, was se\nlected and was put into drydock lor\nrepairs for \'.he long and perilous Jour\nney. She Is the largest tugboat ever\nhull) on the Delaware, and was launch\ned In IMS at lllllmin\' shipyard. The\nHloeum left New York July 12 last.\nSix days later she was reporfd at\nSt. Thomas, West Indies, and August\n12 was at Buenos Ayres. She was to\nmake stop at Punta.

The\nfire started from spontaneous combus\ntion In the bottom of the bunkers and\nhad It gained headway would have\nbeen an exceedingly difficult proposition\nto contend with. The efficient work\nof the fire department, however, pre\nvented what might have been a str\nlous confagratlon.\nOne would naturally Infir from the\naccount in the columns of our worthy\ncontemporaries, the local evening pa\npers, that our fire company was Incom\npetent and that It Is only because we\nare especially favored by fortune that\nwe do not have conflagrations that\nwould engulf the town, The Inference\nis bad and would be liable to create\nan unfavorable Impression In the minds\nof Insurance and surety companies and\npossible Investors In our property If\nany one read the papers, which,\nfortunately, they sdo not. Credit\nshould be given where due, and\nIt Is generally supposed that we\nhave ft competent and able fire depart\nment and one capable of competing\nwith a quiet northwest Dreeze that was\nhardly strong enough to carry the\nsmoke away.

For ft year or more the agree\nment between the boarding-house men\nagents was strictly reduceO to the min\nimum. The treaty was finally broken\nand the sailor men retaliated.

In the\ndiscussion between the two men, O\'\nConnor and Johnson, the former made\nuse of the word "dogma" In regard\nto Johnson\'s opinion as to the relative\nchances of the candidates In the com\ning presidential election. The word\nwas not understood by Johnson, who\nthought the other was calling blm a\ndog, which he reaenUd and took Imme\ndiate steps to avenge with disastrous\nresult.
