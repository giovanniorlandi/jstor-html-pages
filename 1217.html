        <pre>['The Superior Times\nVOL. XXXX. NO. I^.\nYIBILn.®WST®MB v\nIn all the world there is no tourist\nresort comparable to Yellowstone Na\ntional park. It is unique among the\nscenic regions of the world because,\nIn addition to most of the attractions\nof the others, it has, besides, the\nmost wonderful natural phenomena\nknown to scientists. Its streams and j\nvalleys are not surpassed in beauty j\nby any in the Old World. Its road\nways and hotels are equal to those\nof the favorite resorts of continent\nal Europe. Its area includes. In ad\ndltlon, wonderful geysers, hot springs,\nand the Grand canyon of the Yellow\nstone. Of that mighty gorge, noted\nfor its riot of color, for artistic and\nbeautiful nature-harmony, there Is\nnothing men have written that is ade\nquately descriptive. Words are triv\nial and weak when one experiences\nthe overwhelming sensation produced\nby a first glimpse of its wonders. In\nall the world there is no more start\nling scene.\nYellowstone National park is the\nscenic gem of the northwestern hem\nisphere. It lies party in Montana and\npartly in Idaho, but largely in Wyo\nming, among the greatest peaks of\nthe American Rockies. It comprises\n3.312 square miles, with a forest re\nserve adjoining it.\nThe first man to see and know any\nportion of what Is now the Yellow\nstone park, was John Colter. Colter\nhad been with Lewis and Clark to\nthe mouth of the Columbia river, and\non his return In 180 G severed his con\nnectlon with those explorers and re\ntraced his course to the headwaters\nof the Yellowstone. During the sum\nmer of ISO 7, tie traversed at least the\neastern part of the Yellowstone park\ncountry, and the map In the Lewis\nand Clark report, published In 1814\nshows “Colter\'s Route in 1807."\nThe next known of the region was\nIn 1812, when an article describing\nthe geysers was printed in the West\nern Literary Messenger of Buffalo, N.\nY The author was Warren Angus\nFerris, an employe of the American\nFur Company who, with two Pend\nd\'Oreille Indians, visited one of the\ngeyser areas in 1824.\nMany of the mountaineers and fur\nepers of the period long before the\nc•• war, knew of the* locality. James\nITidger, a noted guide and explorer,\nand Joseph Meek, an old time mourn\ntain man, often told of the g< ysers\nand hot springs.\nFolsom and Cook of Montana, made\nan extended tour of the country In\n1869, but the real discovery of the\npark came In 1 when several * ext\nern pioneers with Gen li D Wash\nturn as their loader made an extend\ned exploration of the region. To the\nWashburn party Is to he credited the\nInitiative whbh ultimately resulted\nIn the region becoming a national\npark.\nTransportation within Yellowstone\nNational park is by stage coach ex\nclusively. Fren automobiles are not\npermitted within its boundaries The\nwilds have been but little touched by\nInfluences which would destroy their\ncharm.\nBetween Gardiner, at the end of the\nrailway, and Mammoth Hot Springs,\nthe site of the fir.-t of the hotels,\nlarge roaches hauled h> six horses\nart ! Beyond Man.moth Hot\nve 1\nl - h day s ,-ourr, y thro ;ith the\n1 :,. -v - \' Tb : ir.d•\n: - ... g suddes\nness. Each wonder spot, when\npassed, is found to he but the preface\nto something more inspiring.\nWith each succeeding year the wild\nanimals in the park become a more\ninteresting feature of it. Here Is\nreally the only place where the pub\nlic in general can freely see the ani\nmals of the forest and the wilds in\ntheir natural state. The animals\nevince less and less timidity and.\nwhile not common, It Is not an unusu\nal sight, as the coaches drive along,\nto see an elk or a deer or two sla\nking their thirst in the stream or sev\neral quietly and unconcernedly feed\ning In the woods near the road.\nThe effort to Increase the buffalo\nherd by outside purchase and to cor\nral the animals where they can tie\nfed and protected has met with suc\ncess. There are now about 100 bison\nin the park.\nThere are about 2,000 antelopes and\nfrom 100 to 200 mountain sheep in\nthe park, most of them living on and\naround Mount Everts near Mammoth\nHot Springs Both sheep and ante\nlopes are more wary than the other\nanimals, and, t 0 a great extent disap\npear in the spring In the fall, win\nter and spring, both antelopes and\nsheep are found in large numbers on\nthe hills and flats above Gardiner and\nMammoth Hot Springs. They are\n: fed by the authorities at Fort Yel\nlowstone, which serves to domesticate\nthem in some degree, and in recent\nI years many antelopes remain to graze\n| during the summer on the large al\n-1 falfa field at the park entrance.\nThe deer, of which there are him\nj dreds, are increasing in number, and\nthe pretty animals are seen more and\n\'more each year, During the fall, win\n, ter and spring, like the sheep and an\nt elope, they are a familiar £lght\naround Fort Yellowstone and Mam\nmoth Mot Springs\nIt 1s the elk. however, that are\nI found In almost countless numbers\n. and during the hummer they ate not\nj infrequently seen. They seclude them\n• selves, more or less, however.

"It puts Justice\nBrower in the position of contending\nthat if the federal gov< rnment is\ngiven the power to tax Incomes such\npower would be taken away from tln\nstates. He is cpioted as saving if tin\npower to tax incomes is given tin\ngovernment, we will see tin- stales\ntaxed not out of their existence, but\nout of their vitality \'\n"Of course, such a statement is ut\nterly ridiculous, absurd and senile. In\nno way and under no circumstances\nwould the proposed amendment to (lie\nconstitution give tin- federal govern\nment power to tax any state out of\neither existence or vitality. The lax\nwould be laid under the proposed\namendment on the incomes of citizens\nof all states for federal purposes only\nand the amendment would in no way\nwithdraw from the states the power\nthey already have to tax incomes for\nstate and municipal purposes."\nJustice David .1, Hrewer, supreme\ncourt, covered a wide range of suh\njects in his address before the agents\'\nassociation of the Northwestern Mu\ntual Life Insurance Company.\nOn each he gave voice to thoughts\nwhich are of the deepest Interest and\ndeserve the widest consideration\nJustice Hrewer seemed to feel that he\nwas talking not to the agents of an\ninsurance company, but to the people\nof the whole country.\nHe touched in succession on the\nconstitution, the civil war, religious\namendments to the constitution and\nthe freedom from religions jiersecu\ntion here, to the duty of paying as you\ngo, an income tax, which he does not\napprove, advocated home rub-, tor-ed\na bouquet to tiie supreme court, ad\nvised assistance to the south in deal\ning with the negro ipn-stion and aid\nthe woman suffrage question vvas here\nto stay,\nE. riciency of Guard Praised.\nTon.
