The statesman in\nquestion is not one of those who are\nmost firmly convinced of the benefits\nof total abstinence, and the evening of\na certain public function at which roy\nalty was to be present, found him in SL\ncondition which* would not have been\nedifying to the supporters of that\nmovement. The late queen was re\nceiving the guests of honor, and it was\nnecessary that the convivial M. P.\nshould be presented with the rest. As\nhe approached his sovereign Victoria\nextended her hand for him to kiss.\nBut he did not kiss it instead he\ngrasped and shook it with vigorous\nenthusiasm, while he scrutinized her\nface with grave perplexity.\n"Your face, madam," he observed^\n"is perfectly familiar to me, but I\'m\nlowed if I can remember your\nname!"Harper\'s Weekly.\nFruit That Eve Bit.\nA fruit supposed to hear the mark\nof Eye\'s teeth is one of the many bo\ntanical curiosities of Ceylon. The\ntree, on which it grows is known by\nthe significant name of "the forbid\nden fruit," or "Eve\'s apple tree."\' The\nblossom has a very pleasant scent, but\nthe really remarkable feature of the\ntree, the one to which it owes its\nname, is the fruit. It is beautiful and\nhangs from the tree in a peculiar man\nner. Oranges on the outside and deep\ncrimson within each fruit has the ap\npearance of having had a piece bit\nten out of it This fact, together with\nits poisonous quality, led the Mahom\nmedans to represent it as the forbid\nden fruit of the garden of Eden and to\nwarn men ag&nst its noxious proper\nties. 7-*.,,y\nA Complaint Verified.\n"I have almost nothing to wear," she\nsighed, -j,\nBut her cruel husband laughed.\n"I liave almost nothing to wear!" she\ncried,\nBut he only smiled and chaffed. f\nHe is now the most penitent of men,t\nAnd says he has been a brute,\nFor she truly moved him to pity when*\nShe cam* out in her bathing suit.\n-\'.Philadelphia Iiedger.^\nThere is, however, one -quarter \'oi\nthe world, one nation, ne people,\nwhere and among whom war has been\nan everipresent possibility for many\nyears, aad is apparently now actually\nbeginning.

It also brings the trainmen to\nattention.\nThe explosion of one torpedo is a\nsignal to stop..\nThe explosion of two not more than\n200 feet apart is a signal to reduce\nspeed and look out for a stop signal.\nIn order to protect themselves\nagainst damage suits arising from ac\ncidents the railroad company\'s rules\nare very stringent. No company will\nemploy minors on train or yard ser\nvice unless the minors secure the writ\nten consent of their* parents or guard\nians. This is done because of the\ndanger of the work. In like manner\nno person is employed who has not\nbeen rigidly examined by a physician\nof the company to discover any de\nfects in the sense of hearing, sight or\ncolor perception of the applicant.\nMany young men are rejected on this\naccount.\nNo person is allowed to ride free on\ntrains except as specially provided for.\nFor instance, in Nevada and Arizona\nthe Southern Pacific company allows\nIndians to ride on freight trains as\nmuch as they like. There are many\nreasons why this is allowed, among\nthem being that the Indians are good\ntrack walkers and faithfully report\nany damage to the rails when they\ndiscover them. Old Johnson Sides,\nchief of the Piutes in Nevada, has\nbeen a friend of railroad men ever\nsince the Central Pacific was built. In\nearly days the Piutes rendered invalu\nable service to the railroad company\nby informing them of washouts in win\nter and helping to extinguish prairie\nfires in summer.Sidney P. Robertson\nin San Francisco Call.\nThe Bashi-Bazouk\'s Costume.\nLike each of the various clans of\nthe Kurds, the Bashi-Bazouk can eas\nily be distinguished by his costume..\nHis shoes or "yemenys" (meaning\nleather) are red or black. His golf-\n-Swung vertically in a ciWTfc\nacross the track.\nlike stockings, which leave the knee\nexposed, are elaborately embroidered\nin black, his short Turkish trousers\nare homespun, while about his waist\nis a short sash of .wool or silk, sur\nmounted by a leather belt in rich col\nors and embossed in red. This is di\nvided into three or four sections, in\nwhich he keeps his revolver, his chi\nbouk, or pipe, and his. yataghan, al\nways kept sharp. The Bashi-Bazouks\nnever carry daggers, as the Circas\nsians do. A cartridge box hangs from\nhis side, as also a small silver snuff\nbox. They wear two jackets, the un\nder one with short sleeves and the\noutside with long. At the elbow is an\nopening, in which they carry in a\nleather bag written quotations from\nthe Koran as a talisman to protect\nthem from the bullets of the adver\nsary. About the neck .is a chain of\nsilver coins, from which is suspended\na powder box.\nPractical.\n"One of my ancestors," said the\nyoung man who came a-wooing, "was\na signer of the declaration of indepen\ndence." "That\'s very good," answered\nMr. Cumrox. "But I don\'t believe that\nfactWould suffice to make my daugh\nter happy.

On one occasion I was\nsent^out on an errand for Thomas Car\nlyle and, being unable to get exactly\nwuac was required, I brought the near\nest thing to it that I could get. On\nmy return, after telling him I had not\ngot the actual thing I was sent for,\nbut that I had brought instead some\nthing else as near to it as possible,\nCarlyle produced a shilling, which he\ngave me. as he said: \'Not because I\nhad done .as I was told, which was\nonly what I ought to do, but because\nI had used my intelligence.\' On return\ning home and telling my father about\nit I was very much disgusted when\nhe told me not to spend the shilling,\nbut to have a hole made in it and keep\nit,\' as he said that Carlyle did not\ngive many shillings away and some\nday I should no doubt prize it. Al\nthough rather disgusted at the time,\nI kept the shilling and it is to-day\namong my most treasured posses-\nsions\'."\nThe double reason which the stern\nfather gave in advising the boy to\nkeep the shilling will be appreciated\nby every Carlyle student.\nSPREAD OF NEW LANGUAGE.\n"Esperanto" Said to Be Capable of\nUniversal Use.\nAccording to reports from Europe\nthe spread of Esperanto, the language\ninvented for universal use, has proved\nof value to Esperantists. At a recent\ngathering in London one of the guests\nbrought with him a French gentleman\nand his wife and a Czech from Bo\nhemia. None of the three could speak\na word of English, but Esperanto was\nfound to be a perfectly facile medium\nfor conversation. The Bohemian gen\ntleman had had various amusing ex\nperiences while journeying through\nEurope. He had taken one of the Es\nperanto journals, marked the names\nof the secretaries of the various\ngroups in the foreign towns through\nwhich he had pass and so, not\nknowing anything of the languages, he\nhad traveled through several conti\nnental countries, seeing .all that was\n^tor"h^sen/with^the^\nhelp Of various\n\'^spfflraM6^flen^,^a1a^~"~fifiatry\' af\nrived in England. He knocked at\nthe door of a London Esperantist, who\ncame down to interview the stranger,\nfound that he needed a home while in\nLondon, but did not know where to\ngo, as no one could understand him\nThere was no difliculty, as both could\ncommunicate in Esperanto.\nPopularity of the Dahlia.\nDahlias are growing in popularity,\nand dahlia shows are held in some\ncities. In the wild plant the flowers\nare single, with a dull gray and yellow\ndisk the varieties of the cultivated\nforms are almost endless. The plant\nwas discovered in Mexico by Vincent\nCervantes about 1784 and was first\ntaken to the botanic gardens of\nMadrid and the same year it was in\ntroduced into England by the march,\nioness of Bute. The plant became ex\ntinct in that country and was again\ntaken thither in. 1804. In that year\nis found the earliest mention of the\ndahlia, named from Andrew Dahl, a\nSwedish botanist and pupil of Lin\nnaeus. In Mexico the tubers are cul\ntivated as food, on account of the\nquantity of inulin they contain, but\nelsewhere, though many times tried,\nthey never have become popular, be\ning regarded as unpalatable.\nQuestion of Style.\nThe Princess Chinquilla, daughter of\nvhe late Lone Star, chjef of the Chey\nennes, attended a reception not long\nago attired in the native costume of\nher rank. The princess is a Carlisle\ngraduate, and an unusually bright and\ninteresting young woman, quick to\nthink and to speak. Her costume was\nrather conspicuous, and presently Jt\nbecame the subject of conversation\namong the little party about her.\n"Do you wear it on the streets of\nNew York, Princess?" inquired a nian.\n"Not now," she replied. "I did\nwhen I first came to the East, but the\npeople laughed at me, so I changed it\nto your native style.

By Poultney BIgelow. Volume 3.\n$2.25 net. New York: Harper & Brothers.\nWhile the literature of Germany leads\nthe world in advanced thought concern\ning philosophy, science, and even the\nology, it is absolutely barren as to biog\nraphies of the men who were prominent\nin the struggle for liberty which began\nimmediately following the battle of Wa\nterloo, and ended in 1848. The author\nfeelingly states that no mention is made\nin German literature of men above medi\nocre ability who took part in that move\nment, and that his task has been one of\ninteresting delving into thousands of\npages of dead records of the past to ob\ntain the information desired, not a page\nof which was enlivened by a personal\nreminiscence or anecdote of the leaders\nof that movement.\nIt is needlss to say this popular up\nrising of the people was never sanctioned\nby those in power, and leaders wer\nruthlessly sent to\nprisonits Neverthelese\nthere Were many \'advocates, but the pen\nof the censor prohibited the circulation\nof documents urging any change in the\nprerogatives of the existing absolute mon\narchy. The censor even went so far as\nto confiscate private papers, and several\npatriots, subsequently suspected, gave\nthanks that their papers and houshold\npossessions were destroyed either by Are\nor other disaster.\nWith this dearth of material to work\nupon, the student can fully appreciate\nthe exhaustive labor the author imposed\nupon himself to acquire data from which\nto accurately describe this momentous\nstruggle for liberty. That he has done\nhis work well is apparent to any one who\nwill read this volume and no better en\nconium can be given than to say it will\nstand as a monument to his\nindustry and literal*}- ability\niunwearying present\ning for the first time a faithful history of\nthe struggle of the German people for\nliberty.\nANTISEMITISM.\nAntisemitism. By Bernard Lazare.\nTranslated from the French. 8vo. Pp.\n384. Gloth gilt top. $2. New York: In\nternational Library Publishing Co.\nRecent events in Russia have given\nthis book a peculiar timeliness. It is a\ntranslation from the French, and its\npages must have been written many\nmonths before those outbreaks gave a\nmost painful int#est to the Jewish ques\ntion. The author,is himself a. Hebrew,\nand subject to an\'the odium that is im\nplied in the title to his book, but this\ncircumstance does not seem to have bi\nased his judgment in the forming of his\nopinions. The case is certainly stated\nwith great candor, and the blame is dis\ntributed with fairness. TThe fault is found\nto be not all on the part of the Gentile\nworld, but the Israelite himself is char\nged with having brought, much of the\ntrouble to his people by manifest short\ncomings.\nThe treatment given the subject is his\ntorical. In successive chapteVs the re\nlations between Jews and Gentiles are\ntraced from the earliest* times. Perhaps\nthe reader will be most surprised to\nlearn how much of proselyting has been\ncarried on reciprocally between the He\nbrews and their neighbors. From this\nhas l\'esulted a greater mixture of race\nthan Jews would, perhaps, willingly ad\nmit.. The author does not believe in race\ndistinctions whether these be founded up\non language, shape of the head, or color\nof the skin. So long, however, as the\nopinion prevails that races are distinct\nand that there is superiority on the one\npart and inferiority on the other part\nthere is likely to be trouble between Jew\nand Gentile as well as between black and\nwhite. There are too many illustrative\nexamples of this in the current history\nof this country, and this book can be\nread with profit by many who are called\nupon to decide questions daily arising\nhere.\nCIVIL WAR TIMES.\nCivil War Times.

It can be read\nwith profit by any one and many inci\ndents of the great strife which has hith\nerto remained unwritten, is brought forth\nby Mr. Howe.\nOne of the most interesting chapters\nIn the volume is one dealing with the re\nlation of the Confederacy toward the\'"Ne-\ngro Soldier." The author tells us, that\nnearly every important Confederate com\nmander favored the enlistment of black\nsoldiers that the matter was finally de\nbated in the Confederate Senate, and the\nbill authorising the enlistment of Negro\nsoldiers, was defeated by but one vote\nthat of Senator Hunter. That when the\ndesperate circumstances of the Confed\neracy became so visible that the leaders\nsaw the& doom of Richmond and the\n"cause," a draft order was issued to force\nthe black soldier to fight under the Con\nfederate flag, but that before it could be\nmade effective, the fall of Richmond, and\nthe flight of Jefferson Davis was at hand.\nThis chapter is especially interesting at\nthis time in view of the present propa\nganda of the Southern people, to debase\nthe Negro, whom they were perfectly\nwilling in the last desperate strait of\nthe Confederacy, to enlist as a soldier,\nunder its banner.\niThere are other very interesting chap\nters in the book. The style is clear, unin\nvolved and natural, and the author has\nwritten instructively.\nCRUISING AMONG THE CARIBEES.\nCruising among the Caribees.

Barnes & Co.\nThe "real" and "true" people seem to\nhave the front of the stage just now.\nAn unpleasant impression has prevailed\nin many quarters that Benedict Arnold\nhas not been fairly treated, that his serv\nices to his country were ignored and his\ngreat fault was not over-emphasized per\nhaps, but unreasonably punished. Treach\nery to one\'s country far surpasses the\nother great treachery to one\'s friend and\nis not to be condoned in any wise. There\nmay be, however, certain circumstances\nwhich explain the deed and modify the\nbitter condemnation.\nWhile lot condoning Arnold\'s treason,\nMr. Todd emphasizes his invaluable aerv\nlcoti to America, and shows conclusively\nthat he four times saved the cause of the\nColonies: first at the battle of V&lcour\'s\nIsland on Lake Champlaln (the first naval\nbattle,- by the way, in which our arms\nwere engaged), where, by his desperate\nvalor, he gave the British such whole\nsome respect for American arms that\nthey gave up their plan of Invasion from\nthe north that year second, by raising\nthe siege of Fort Stanwix in the Mohawk\nValley and putting to flight St. Leger\'s\ninvading army marching to aid Burgoyne,\nand third and fourth by winning the two\nbattles of Saratoga, which, conjoined,\nCressy included as one of the fifteen de*\ncisive battles of the world.\nMr. Todd also shows that it was the\ninfluence of Arnold\'s wife and his fear\nof losing her should her treasonable cor\nrespondence with the British officers be\ndiscovered, which induced A.rno"* io be\ntray his country, and not the gross In\njustice of Congress nor the calamities of\npaper generalsthe motives generally\nascribed. The book Is an original and\nunique contribution to revolutionary his\ntory. The illustrations are Interesting\nand instructive especially noteworthy io\nthe reproduction of an old print* repre\nsenting the burning of Arnold In sfflgy.\nAs death drew near, It is said his mind\nwandered, and he was again in America,\nfighting his battles with Washington and\nhis old comrades in arms. In a lucid in\nterval he asked that hla Continental uni\nform of a major-generai, in which he had\nescaped to the "Vulture," and which he\nhad ever cherished, might be brought and\nput on him, with the epaulets and sword\nknots which Washington Imd givon him\n.as the bravest of the fvmvo.\n"Let me die In my old -American uni-\nform," he said, "the uniform in which\nI fought my battles. God forgive me,"\nhe added, "for ever putting on any\nRtb^r."\nfrom the ^skilled bootblack, laundry\nman and farmer to the manufacturer\nand banker. We must not he ashamed\nto begin business on a low scale. We\nhave no time to. waste in drawing\nto fritter away lamenting over present\nconditions.

Let\nany man lay down his own premises\nand he can produce almost unanswer\nable arguments. The trouble is, the\npremises are incorrect* For instance,\nthey hop on the better element of the\ncolored race for not teaching these\npeople better, for not pointing out to\nthem, not only the wrong, but the dan\nger of such things some writers go so\nfar as to say that the respectable ele\nment rather shows an inclination to\nprotect, or at least to sympathize with,\nthe rapist. This may be true in some\ncases, though we doubt itat least i\ndoubt that any well educated or re-j\nspectable ftegro ever does this.\nBut the point we make is thisthe\nclass of Negroes given to these out\nrages never go inside of a church\nthey never attend school they never\nhear, much less read, of what is going\non. In other words, they can not be\nreached. Last week at the meeting of\nthe Rowan Baptist Association, com\nposed of colored people, held in this\nplace, some strong talks were made\niui.wv.u^* .and papers read condemning this\nsingers for its success, but on itsi crime in unmeasured terms, yet,how\nmuch good was done? Not a man of the\nclass sought to be reached was in the\nhouse. It can bejsaki that others could\ntalk to them even if they do not at\ntend a church or any school, but the\ntrouble is in locating this class. They\nare isolated from the best element of\ntheir race in fact, the ignorant Negro\ngets it into his head that his brother\nwho knows something is "stuck up"\nand don\'t want to know him. This is\nnatural, and, in fact, white people get\nthe same idea in their heads, so that\nit is impossible to reach these classes.\nSifted down, the cure lies in education\nin school and in the churchany\nand everywhere^ but the first thing is\neducation, for if you{ can get a boy to\nattend school, he twil learn these\nthings, even if he cannot be taught to\nread, writeor ciphr" but the point\'\n$4\n$3\n$1.50 $2\nfrieze and cheviots, which\n$12 $15 $18\n$6 %7.m $9\n4\nThe above clothing will be\nshown on separate tables\nis to reach him, to pen him up and en\nlighten him.Greensboro (N.

Oxygen is a feeder of liv\ni?g tissues.\nDisease and sickness arise from lack\nof vitality, which is due to lack/of\noxygen in the blood.
