Today, education is a human right, and the right to \neducation and specifically the right to (a) basic education is acknowledged and \nemphasised worldwide.2 In South Africa the right to a basic education is entrenched \nin the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (hereafter "the \nConstitution") and is regarded as one of the most crucial constitutional rights, \nparticularly because it promotes economic and social well-being. \nSection 29 of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution guarantees the right to a basic \neducation. The state is required to "protect, respect, promote and fulfil" the right to \neducation.3 This can be done only if laws and regulations are passed by government, \npolicies are developed, and relevant programmes are established. The right to \n                                                          \n\uf02a  Chrizell Chürr. LLB, LLM (UP), LLD (UNISA). Associate Professor, School of Law, University of \nSouth Africa.

However, the Constitution refers to "a right to a basic education". For the purposes \nof this article (and to be consistent and in line with the Constitution), the author will refer to "a \nright to a basic education". \n3 It is important to differentiate between "the right to education" and the "right to a basic \neducation". The right to education is "broader" than the right to a basic education, since the \nright to a basic education refers only to a person\'s basic learning needs (such as literacy, \nexpression, numeracy and problem solving) and the basic learning content (such as knowledge, \nskills, values and attitudes). The right to education is a universal entitlement to education and \nalso includes the responsibility to provide basic education for all individuals. In other words, the \nright to education is not restricted to basic education: it is something more – it is a tool that \nimproves the quality of life. (See, in general, UNESCO 2000 http://www.unesco.org/education/ \nwef/en-conf/Jomtien%20Declaration%20eng.shtm. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2406 \neducation is justiciable and the state can therefore be confronted and challenged in \ncourt if it does not succeed with its constitutional obligations regarding education.4 \nEducation is also regarded as one of the most valuable requirements pertaining to \nglobal progress and advancement. Not only does it equip the learner with the \nnecessary abilities and skills for a meaningful occupation, but it is also a suitable \ninstrument to convey the fundamental tone of a human rights culture to a young \nand upcoming generation. Moreover, education is a way to set people free from their \nlack of knowledge, false notions and fear. Education furnishes people with dignity, \nself-respect and self-assurance, and is an important basic human right on which the \nrealisation and fulfilment of other rights depend.5 \nEducation and the right to a basic education are not only of cardinal importance on a \nnational level, but also on an international level. Many national constitutions \nworldwide make provision for the right to (a basic) education. One can thus say that \nmeaningful and significant existence is dependent worldwide on education. \nThe South African school system is crippled by a myriad of unfavourable challenges, \nsituations and circumstances. These include inequalities in the school environment, \nthe lack of quality education in a safe environment, insufficient funds for the \nprovision of basic education, inadequate buildings, a shortage of qualified and skilled \neducators, and the inability of the school system to cater for learning differences, to \nmention only a few. Many of these challenges, situations and circumstances are \nfrustrating and solutions have been sought diligently – many with success and many \nwithout success. \nThus, the South African school system is suffering a great ordeal. This was \nconfirmed by the South African Minister of Basic Education, Mrs Angie Motshekga, \nwhen she stated the following: "Let\'s face it: Education is in a severe crisis. We have \n                                                          \n4 Pendlebury 2008/2009 SACG 25. \n5 Oosthuizen and Rossouw 2001 Koers 656; also see Devenish Constitution 153. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2407 \na big problem".6 Moreover, there seems to be a strong increase in the percentage of \nschool dropout rates7 as well:8 \nTable 1: Percentage school dropout rates for various grades \nYear Grade 2 \nenrolment \n(2000; \n2001; \n2002; \n2003) \nGrade 10 \nenrolment \n(2008; \n2009; \n2010; \n2011) \nGrade 11 \nenrolment \n(2009; \n2010; \n2011; \n2012) \nGrade 12 \nenrolment \n(2010; \n2011; \n2012; \n2013) \n% dropout \nrate(s) \nGrades 1012\n2010 1 090 765 1 076 527 881 661 579 384 −46% \n2011 944 977 1 017 341 841 815 534 498 −47% \n2012 1 012 892 1 039 762 847 738 551 837 −47% \n2013 1 111 858 1 094 189 874 331 576 490 −49% \nIt is clear from Table 1 that the school dropout rates increase almost every year. It \nis also expected that the dropout rate for 2014 will be higher than in 2013 (the \nstatistics for 2014 have not yet been finalised). \nOne can therefore argue that it is obvious that drastic action should be taken in \norder to save the school system from further downfall and destruction. It appears \nthat the mainstream school system in South Africa does not function satisfactorily \nand that other alternatives (and possibly another school system) should be \nconsidered. \nThe focus in this article falls on the questions of whether the current South African \nschool system sufficiently realises the constitutional rights of learners and whether \nan alternative school system could lead to the increased fulfilment and realisation of \nSouth African children\'s rights (with a specific focus on the rights to a basic \n                                                          \n6 Nel 2014 http://www.netwerk24.com/nuus/2014-12-06-onderwys-in-groot-krisis-s-angie. \n7 "Dropout rates" refers to the percentage of children who do not complete school. Also see the \ndiscussion in para 4.2.3 and para 5 below. \n8 Louw 2015 http://www.equaleducation.org.za/article/2015-01-02-on-the-upcoming-2014-matricresults.\n\n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2408 \neducation, equality and dignity). The article therefore deals with the "acceptability" \n(see paragraph 2.2 below) of the South African school system. \nThe following issues are discussed in this article: The right to a basic education, \nrelated constitutional rights, the German tripartite school system with its focus on \nthe individual and learning differences, the South African school system with its \nfocus on mainstream education, and relevant international instruments. \nThe German school system was selected for the purposes of this article in order to \nillustrate that a tripartite school system (as in Germany) can be to the benefit of all \nlearners if such a system is applied properly and with due care. A tripartite school \nsystem provides for learners’ diverse individual learning backgrounds, as well as \ntheir different learning aptitudes, skills, talents and interests. Such a school system \nwould certainly be beneficial for a diverse country such as South Africa. \nIt should be kept in mind that Germany has one of the world’s best education \nsystems and is one of today’s most important industrial nations – thanks to its \neducation system that is flexible and that properly provides for diversity (also see \nparagraph 4.1.7 below). Therefore, South Africa can learn some valuable lessons \nfrom Germany with regard to Germany’s tripartite school system and education \nrights.9 \n2 The right to a basic education in South Africa \nThe right to a basic education is enshrined in section 29(1)(a) of the Constitution – \nfor both adults and children. Section 29 consists of a group of education rights and is \nalso known as a "hybrid" right because section 29(1) typifies the socio-economic \nnature of the right, while sections 29(2) and (3) are categorised as civil and political \nrights. There is an obligation on the state in terms of section 29(1) to make \neducation available and accessible to everyone; the Constitution explicitly \nguarantees the right to a basic education.10 However, it is important to note that \nsection 29 does not specify the content and quality of the education that the state \n                                                          \n9  It must be kept in mind that Germany has 16 different states (Länder) and a full discussion of \nthe educational situations in all of these states does not fall within the scope of this article.  \n10 Arendse 2011 PELJ 97. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2409 \nmust provide,11 nor has the South African Constitutional Court considered the scope \nand content of the right to a basic education.12 One should also note that section 29 \ndoes not refer to all universally accepted education rights.13 Free and compulsory \neducation does not form part of the right to a basic education, although provision is \nmade for compulsory education in section 3(1) of the South African Schools Act.14 \nThere is also no explicit right of equal access to educational institutions, but it can \nbe assumed that this right is absolutely and completely enclosed and protected by \nsection 9 of the Constitution, which specifically deals with equality.15 \nAn important question pertaining to section 29 is: \n[D]oes section 29 promise merely a place to go to school, or does it provide for an \n\'adequate\' education?16 \nIt is submitted that the right to a basic education compels the state to provide \nadequate education in order for the right to be enjoyed and fulfilled.17 The right to a \nbasic education can therefore be described as: \n... an unqualified right requiring the priority attention of the State, also in respect of \nbudgetary allocations. This requires the State to provide sufficient schools, \neducators and support, and other incidental services in order to ensure reasonable \naccess to basic education for everybody. The right refers to education up to a level \nof functional literacy, in other words, reading, writing, arithmetic, and an \nelementary knowledge or awareness of economics, culture and politics.18 \nWith regard to the meaning of "adequate" education, Malherbe submits as follows:19 \nIn the South African context \'adequate\' education could refer to a standard of \neducation that empowers people to rise above the poverty cycle and compete \neffectively in the labour market, enables people to understand and enjoy their \n                                                          \n11 Taiwo Implementation of the Right to Education 116. \n12 Arendse 2011 PELJ 98. \n13 Universally accepted rights are the following: the right to education, equal access to educational \nfacilities, freedom of choice, education in the language of one\'s choice, the right to establish \nprivate educational institutions, availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability.

However, before the concept of basic education can be explained, it is \nnecessary to define "education". Education can be defined as follows:22 \nEducation in its broadest, general sense is the means through which the aims and \nhabits of a group of people [live] on from one generation to the next. Generally it \noccurs through any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, \nfeels, or acts. In its narrow, technical sense, education is the formal process by \nwhich society deliberately transmits its accumulated knowledge, skills, customs and \nvalues from one generation to another. \nThe concept of "basic education" can be explained as follows:23 \nBasic education is that whole range of educational activities in different settings \nthat aim to meet basic learning needs. It comprises both formal schooling (primary \nand sometimes lower secondary) and a variety of non-formal, informal, public and \nprivate educational activities offered to meet the defined basic learning needs of \npeople of all ages. \nIt can therefore be submitted that the difference between basic education and \neducation is that basic education focuses on the "stage" when children first start \nlearning (their basic learning needs), and education focuses on the overall \ntransmission of aims, values and habits from one generation to another. \nThe concept of basic education can also be defined as follows: \n                                                          \n20 Devenish Bill of Rights 398. \n21 Devenish Bill of Rights 398. \n22 Dewey Democracy and Education 1-4. \n23 HSRC and EPC Report on Education 141. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2411 \n[D]aardie tipe opvoedende onderwys wat \'n leerder ontvang en wat hom [en haar] \ntoerus met die basiese vaardighede van funksionele geletterdheid (wat die basiese \nvaardighede van lees, skryf en rekenkunde insluit) sowel as \'n basiese kennis en \nbewustheid van ekonomie, kultuur en politiek.24 \nWith regard to the interpretation of the concept of basic education, the Department \nof Education noted the following in its White Paper on Education and Training:25 \nBasic education is a flexible concept which must be defined so as to meet the \n\'learning needs appropriate to the age and experience of the learner, whether child, \nyouth or adult ...\', and should also provide access to nationally recognised \nqualifications. \nThe term "basic education" in section 29(1) of the Constitution must therefore be \nconstrued in the light of what the state can afford. In other words, basic education \nshould fulfil the "learning needs appropriate to the age and experience of the \nlearner, whether child, youth or adult".26 As already mentioned, section 29(1)(a) of \nthe Constitution does not stipulate that all education is free and compulsory. It does, \nhowever, make provision for the educational rights of impoverished children and \ndoes not "preclude a sliding scale of fees" in relation to parents\' children who are \nenrolled at public schools.27 \nThere are several academics and scholars who argue that the South African \ndefinition of basic education is too narrow. The reason for this argument is simple: \nLearners who barely completed Grade 9 are not properly equipped with the \nnecessary knowledge, skills and experience to "tackle" the outside world.28 The \nconsequence of this is that they will be unable to develop to their full potential, to \nlive and work with dignity, pride and self-respect, and to improve the quality and \nvirtues of their lives.29 It is submitted that basic education should include the whole \nschooling career of a learner. That is, basic education should not be defined in terms \n                                                          \n24 Oosthuizen and Rossouw 2001 Koers 662. \n25 The White Paper on Education and Training was published on 15 March 1995 (Gen N 196 in GG \n16312 of 15 March 1995) in terms of the obligations under s 32(a) of the Interim Constitution of \nthe Republic of South Africa 200 of 1993. \n26 Bray "South African Schools Act" 279. \n27 Devenish Bill of Rights 400. \n28 See para 4 below for a discussion on compulsory school attendance. \n29 Khoza Socio-economic Rights 420. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2412 \nof age or the completion of a specific level of schooling; it should rather include \nprimary as well as secondary education.30 \nThus, basic education: \n...should evolve with increasing educational standards and capacities in South \nAfrica, in order to meet the changing requirements of a dynamic society in the \nprocess of political and social transformation.31 \nBasic education must also provide learners with the foundation to be successful and \nflourish in society, including the minimal necessary learning equipment and tools of \nliteracy and numeracy.32 \n2.2 Can the state be compelled by a court of law to provide basic \neducation for individuals? \nSection 7(2) of the Constitution imposes an obligation on the state to "respect, \nprotect, promote and fulfil the rights in the Bill of Rights". Every obligation imposes a \nrelated set of duties on the state, namely:33 \n(a) respect: the state is required to avoid measures that prevent children\'s \nenjoyment of the right to basic education; \n(b) protect: the state is required to prevent other parties such as parents and \ncaregivers from interfering with and hindering children\'s enjoyment of the \nright to basic education; \n(c) promote: the state has the duty to encourage and promote educational \nparticipation and to make citizens aware of their educational rights; and \n(d) Fulfil: the state must take positive measures that enable all children to enjoy \nthe right to basic education. \nThe following case makes it clear that there are positive and negative obligations on \nthe state to give effect to the right to a basic education: In Ex parte Gauteng \n                                                          \n30 Taiwo Implementation of the Right to Education 122. \n31 Devenish Bill of Rights 398. \n32 Devenish Bill of Rights 398. \n33 Pendlebury 2008/2009 SACG 22. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2413 \nProvincial Legislature: In re Dispute Concerning the Constitutionality of Certain \nProvisions of the Gauteng School Education Bill of 1995,34 the court stated as \nfollows:35 \n[The right to [a] basic education] creates a positive right that basic education be \nprovided for every person and not merely a negative right that such person should \nnot be obstructed in pursuing his or her basic education. \nIt is therefore submitted that the right to a basic education imposes both positive \nand negative obligations on the state to provide for education. With regard to the \npositive obligation, the state is required to take effective steps in order to guarantee \nthat every child has access to educational facilities and that every child benefits from \nthe right to education. The negative obligation, on the other hand, poses a duty on \nthe state and its agencies not to impede or hinder children\'s access to education.36 \nTo summarise, the state has the following obligations in terms of section 29 of the \nConstitution:37 \n(a) to provide for adequate basic education; \n(b) to ensure effective access to public educational institutions; \n(c) to ensure, where reasonably possible, that a course of education is conducted in \nthe official language or languages of the learners\' choice in public \neducational institutions; and \n(d) to monitor the introduction of standards and the observance of equivalent \nstandards in the so-called "independent" educational institutions38, as well \nas the registration of these institutions. \n                                                          \n34 Ex parte Gauteng Provincial Legislature: In re Dispute Concerning the Constitutionality of Certain \nProvisions of the Gauteng School Education Bill of 1995 1996 3 SA 165 (CC). \n35 Ex parte Gauteng Provincial Legislature: In re Dispute Concerning the Constitutionality of Certain \nProvisions of the Gauteng School Education Bill of 1995 1996 3 SA 165 (CC) para 9. Although \nthis case was decided under the Interim Constitution (Constitution of the Republic of South \nAfrica 200 of 1993), it is still of great value because it emphasises the state\'s duty to promote \nand to give effect to the right to a basic education. \n36 Pendlebury 2008/2009 SACG 19. \n37 De Groof "Some Comments and Questions" 63. \n38 The South African Schools Act 84 of 1996 makes provision for two types of schools, namely, \npublic schools and independent schools. Public schools are controlled by the state, whereas \nindependent schools are privately governed and administered. Independent schools/institutions \nare required to register with the state and standards not lower than those of similar public \nschools/institutions must be upheld by these independent schools/institutions.  \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2414 \nIn addition, the state also has the obligation in terms of article 13(2) of the \nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (hereafter "the \nICESCR") to make education available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable. This is \nalso known as the "4-A Scheme".39 \nThe "4-A\'s" are interrelated and essential features of education and contribute to the \nsuccessful provision of the right to a basic education:40 \nTable 2: The 4-A Scheme \nAvailability Accessibility Acceptability Adaptability \nThe state has the \nduty to provide \neducation and to \nmake it available to \nall children. In other \nwords, the state has \nthe duty to make \neducational \ninstitutions and \nprogrammes \navailable in sufficient \nquantity in order to \nmeet the needs of \nchildren. The \navailability obligation \ncan be fulfilled \nthrough a public \neducation system \nand by allowing nonstate\nactors to \nestablish non-public \nschools. The state \nwill then have a \ncombination of both \npublic schools and \nnon-public (private) \nschools. \nThe state has the \nduty to make \neducational \ninstitutions and \nprogrammes \naccessible to \neveryone, without \ndiscrimination − as \nstipulated in section \n9 of the Constitution. \nIn order to meet the \naccessibility criteria, \nschools must be \nphysically and \neconomically \naccessible and \naffordable. \nThe state has the \nduty to ensure that \nthe form and \nsubstance of \neducation, as well as \nthe curricula and \nteaching methods, \nare acceptable, \nrelevant, culturally \nappropriate and of \nhigh quality to \nchildren. In order to \nmeet the \nacceptability \nobligation, the state \nmust ensure that the \neducation provided is \nstable, reliable and \nconsistent with the \nrights of children set \nout in human rights \ninstruments such as \nthe ICESCR and the \nConvention on the \nRights of the Child \n(hereafter "the \nCRC"). \nThe education \nsystem has to be \nflexible and \nexpandable in order \nto adapt to the needs \nof changing societies \nand communities, \nand to respond to \nthe needs and \nrequirements of \nlearners and \nstudents within their \nsocial and cultural \ncircumstances. Thus, \nthere is a necessity \nfor curriculum \nflexibility, litheness, \nand adaptation to \nmeet the needs of \nchildren. \nIn order to fulfil its constitutional obligations, the state has established a mainstream \nand inclusive school system. This school system aims at being inclusive, efficient, \n                                                          \n39 See the discussion on the ICESCR in para 6.2 below. \n40 Pendlebury 2008/2009 SACG 20; see also Coomans 2007 SIM Special 20 137-138. \n', "C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2415 \nand attentive to the quality of learning conditions and outcomes.41 However, many \nquestions remain: Does the South African school system realise a child's rights to a \nbasic education? How inclusive is the school system? Can an inclusive school system \nsometimes lead to the exclusion of certain learners? Does an inclusive system \ninfringe upon a child's rights to equality and dignity? Is an inclusive mainstream \nschool system in the best interest of the child? These questions will be addressed in \nparagraph 4.2.3 below. However, before addressing these questions, one needs to \nunderstand the way in which the courts adjudicate the right to a basic education and \nhow the right to a basic education relates to other constitutional rights. \n2.3 Adjudication of the right to a basic education \nThere is a compendium of socio-economic rights, which compendium includes rights \nof access to adequate housing, health-care services, sufficient food and water, and \nsocial security. The right to a basic education is part of this compendium of rights. It \nis important to bear in mind that a child's right to a basic education is distinguishable \nfrom other socio-economic rights in the Constitution in the sense that it is not \ndependent on the progressive realisation thereof. \nThe way in which the courts adjudicate the right to a basic education differs from \nthe way in which other socio-economic rights are adjudicated. An explanation of how \nthe adjudication of the right to a basic education differs from the adjudication of the \nright to housing can be summarised as follows: On the one hand, section 26(1) of \nthe Constitution provides that everyone has the right to have access to adequate \nhousing. In terms of this right, the state has the duty to take reasonable legislative \nand other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive \nrealisation of the right to have access to adequate housing.42 In other words, the \nstate is obliged to take progressive steps to realise this right over a period of time. \nThis means that the state needs to consider its available resources, but it does not \nmean that any person is entitled to insist on, or to demand, a house immediately.43 \nOn the other hand, section 29(1)(a) of the Constitution provides that everyone has \n                                                          \n41 Pendlebury 2008/2009 SACG 20; also see Coomans 2007 SIM Special 20 137-138.  \n42 Government of the Republic of South Africa v Grootboom 2001 1 SA 46 (CC). \n43 See, in general, Liebenberg Socio-economic Rights 233-242. \n", 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2416 \nthe right to a basic education, including adult basic education. In terms of this right, \nthe state is not required to realise the right to a basic education over a period of \ntime – the right to a basic education is immediately realisable and does not carry the \nsame limitations as other socio-economic rights contained in the Constitution (such \nas the right to access to adequate housing). The case of Governing Body of the \nJuma Musjid Primary School v Essay44 serves as a good example of how courts \nadjudicate the right to a basic education. The facts of this case are that the High \nCourt authorised the eviction of a public school conducted on private property and \nthe eviction order had a major impact on the learners\' right to a basic education in \nterms of section 29(1) of the Constitution and on the best interests of the children in \nterms of section 28(2) of the Constitution. This case therefore ended up in the \nConstitutional Court, which confirmed that the right to a basic education is not \nsubject to progressive realisation. The court held that:45 \n[i]t is important ... to understand the nature of the right to \'a basic education\' \nunder section 29(1)(a). Unlike some of the other socio-economic rights, this right is \nimmediately realisable. There is no internal limitation requiring that the right be \n\'progressively realised\' within \'available resources\' subject to \'reasonable legislative \nmeasures\'. The right to a basic education may be limited only in terms of a law of \ngeneral application which is \'reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic \nsociety based on human dignity, equality and freedom\'. \nIt is clear from the above that the right to a basic education is a cardinal socioeconomic\nright which aims to promote, improve and develop a child\'s personality, \ntalents, and mental and physical abilities to their fullest extent. The importance of \neducation, especially basic education, can be emphasised again – it is nearly \nimpossible to "survive" without education in an educated world. Education gives \nhuman beings the power to claim and realise their other rights, and the right to a \nbasic education is seen as a "central facilitative right in South Africa\'s constitutional \ndemocracy". One can thus argue that through (a) basic education people are better \nable to recognise the value of their human rights and are in a better position to \nexercise the full range of these rights.46 \n                                                          \n44 Governing Body of the Juma Musjid Primary School v Essay 2011 7 BCLR 651 (CC). \n45 Governing Body of the Juma Musjid Primary School v Essay 2011 7 BCLR 651 (CC) para 37.

This right and \nmany other rights are interdependent. One of the rights that may be relevant is the \nright to mother tongue education (and language rights). Section 29(2) of the \nConstitution states that everyone has the right to receive education in the official \nlanguage or languages of his/her choice in public educational institutions where such \neducation is reasonably practicable. Section 30 of the Constitution stipulates that \neveryone has the right "to use the language and to participate in the cultural life of \ntheir choice, but no one exercising these rights may do so in a manner inconsistent \nwith any provision of the Bill of Rights". Section 31 of the Constitution makes \nprovision for persons to belong to a cultural, religious or linguistic community. This \nsection stipulates that these persons "may not be denied the right, with other \nmembers of that community – (a) to enjoy their culture, practise their religion and \nuse their language; and (b) to form, join and maintain cultural, religious and \nlinguistic associations and other organs of civil society".47 \nMoreover, in order to indicate how the right to (a basic) education may affect other \nrights, the table below will illustrate the rights to education, rights in education and \nrights through education protected in the Constitution:48 \nRights to education Rights in education Rights through education \n\uf0b7 Everyone has the right to \na basic education (s \n29(1)(a)). \n\uf0b7 Everyone has the right to \nfurther education (s \n29(1)(b)) \n\uf0b7 Everyone has the right to \nlearn in their official \nlanguage of choice (s \n29(2)) \n\uf0b7 Everyone has the right to \ndignity (s 10) \n\uf0b7 Everyone has the right to \nequality (s 9) \n\uf0b7 Everyone has the right to \nan environment that is \nnot harmful to health (s \n24) \n\uf0b7 Children have the right to \nprotection from abuse \nBasic education facilities: \naccess to a wide range of \npolitical, social and economic \nrights. \nThese include, amongst \nothers: \n\uf0b7 the rights to equality and \ndignity (ss 9 & 10); \n\uf0b7 the right to further \neducation (s 29); \n                                                          \n47 A full discussion of all these rights does not fall within the scope of this article. For a detailed \ndiscussion, see the book of Liebenberg Socio-economic Rights.  \n48 Pendlebury 2008/2009 SACG 21. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2418 \n\uf0b7 Children have the right to \nbe protected from work \nthat places their \neducation at risk (s \n28(1)(f)) \n \nand neglect (s 28(1)(d)) \n\uf0b7 Children have the right to \nbasic nutrition (s \n28(1)(c)) \n\uf0b7 the right to information \n(s 32); \n\uf0b7 the right to health care \nand social security (s 27); \n\uf0b7 the right to just \nadministrative action (s \n33); \n\uf0b7 the right to freedom and \nsecurity of the person (s \n12); \n\uf0b7 the right to freedom of \nreligion, belief and \nopinion (s 15); and  \n\uf0b7 the right to freedom of \nexpression and \nassociation (s 16). \nAs already noted, these rights are mutually dependent, and when the right to \neducation is under consideration it is important to interpret it in the context of the \nBill of Rights. The ethical standards for a democratic system of education are set \nthrough the right to equality (section 9 of the Constitution) and the right to human \ndignity (section 10 of the Constitution). It is stipulated that:49 \n...every child – regardless of race, gender, culture, language, religion, ability or \ndisability – is equally entitled to learn, under conditions that respect, protect and \npromote the inherent human dignity of each child. \nMoreover, the South African Constitution is mainly and unequivocally "an egalitarian \nconstitution".50 In other words, the focal point of this Constitution is equality. It can \ntherefore be said that the organising principle of the South African Constitution is to \nprevent or proscribe unfair discrimination between individuals.51 \nBecause equality and human dignity are seen as the cornerstone of a democratic \nsystem of education, it is necessary to discuss these two concepts briefly. \n                                                          \n49 Pendlebury 2008/2009 SACG 20. \n50 Krüger 2011 Equal Rights Review 27. \n51 Krüger 2011 Equal Rights Review 27. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2419 \n2.4.1 The right to equality \nSections 9(1) and (2) of the Constitution stipulate that: \n(1) Everyone is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection \nand benefit of the law. \n(2) Equality includes the full and equal enjoyment of all rights and \nfreedoms. … \nSections 9(3) and (4) stipulate further that unfair discrimination against any person \n(directly or indirectly) is prohibited. The right to equality is concerned with the \nprotection and safeguarding of the equal worth of the bearers of this right. \nEquivalently, the right to equality is not a right to equal treatment, but rather a right \n"to have one\'s equal worth with others respected, protected, promoted and \nfulfilled".52 \nMoreover, the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act53 \ndeals with the promotion and advancement of equality on the one hand and clearly \nstipulates which reactive measures are available where the right to equality is \nviolated on the other hand. The reactive provisions include inter alia the prohibition \nof unfair discrimination and related encroachments on the right to equality.54 \nHowever, the equality provision in the South African Constitution does not preclude \nor prevent the state from making classifications. The explanation for this is that \nthere are various reasons why classifications between people are permissible and \nwhy these people may also be treated differently. One should not forget that the \nclassification of people into different groups and the provision of different treatment \nfor different groups can be done only if "the criteria upon which the classifications \nare based are permissible".55 The purpose of the classification will determine \n                                                          \n52 Rautenbach "Bill of Rights" para 1A57.1. \n53 Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000. \n54 Krüger 2011 Equal Rights Review 27. \n55 Albertyn "Equality" para 4.1. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2420 \nwhether such classification is permitted.56 This approach was confirmed by the South \nAfrican Constitutional Court in the case of Prinsloo v Van Der Linde.57 \nThus, in order to climb the "equality ladder" successfully, it will almost always be \nrequired to prove "unfair discrimination" and not just a mere claim to equality. It \nseems as if the South African courts view the right to equality in section 9 of the \nConstitution as "little more than a guarantee of non-discrimination".58 \nIt is thus clear from the above that there is no prohibition on classifying or \ndistinguishing between persons with differences – provided that such classification \nor distinguishing is permissible and does not constitute unfair discrimination. \nConsequently, the right to equality also includes equal education and/or equal \neducational opportunity. This means that learners are protected against \ndiscrimination in education based on race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, \nethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, \nbelief, culture, language and birth. \nLastly, the distribution of resources and supplies in education must be equitable and \nunbiased across all communities in proportion to what is needed.59 \n2.4.2 The right to dignity \nSection 10 of the Constitution stipulates that "everyone has inherent dignity and the \nright to have their dignity respected and protected". Moreover, dignity is not only a \nconstitutional right, but it also has foundational value. This means that the right to \ndignity enlightens, enlivens and leads all other constitutional rights. Moreover, the \nright to dignity is seen as a promise and pledge to human dignity which is \ninseparably connected to the humanity and mortality of the bearer of rights.60 \n                                                          \n56 Albertyn "Equality" para 4.1. \n57 Prinsloo v Van Der Linde 1997 6 BCLR 759 (CC). \n58 See, in general, Van de Lanotte, Sarkin and Haeck Equality 141. \n59 NESRI 2014/2015 https://www.nesri.org/programs/what-is-the-human-right-to-education. \n60 Haysom "Dignity" para 5.2.1. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2421 \nThe importance of the right to dignity was also explicitly emphasised in the case of S \nv Makwanyane:61 \nRecognising a right to dignity is the acknowledgement of the intrinsic worth of \nhuman beings: human beings are entitled to be treated as worthy of respect and \nconcern. This right therefore is the foundation of many other rights that are \nspecifically entrenched.62 \nIt can also be unequivocally stated that the right to dignity is pivotal to democracy.63 \nOne can also argue that, without the recognition and enforcement of the right to \ndignity, the progress and advancement of a country will be severely hampered. \nIn short: Dignity promotes and respects the level of autonomy of the individual, \nprotects and safeguards an individual\'s worth in society, and recognises and \nemphasises that all human beings have equal worth and value.64 In other words: \nThe right to human dignity protects and safeguards the inherent worth of every \nperson.65 Every person qualifies automatically as a bearer of the right to dignity, \nsince every person is human and the inherent worth that attaches to the reality and \ncertainty of being human is therefore protected by this right. One can say that the \nright to dignity is an extraordinary right, as it is not earned and cannot be \nabandoned.66 \nFurthermore, it is also clear that dignity and equality go hand in hand, since dignity \nis pertinent when one needs to establish whether discrimination on an unstipulated \nground exists, whether such discrimination is unfair, and whether unfair \ndiscrimination (if found) is justifiable and admissible as stipulated in section 36 of \nthe Constitution.67 \nLearners’ rights to dignity in education are also protected in the sense that schools \nmust respect the inherent dignity of every learner, which means that a favourable \nenvironment of respect and tolerance in the classroom must be created in order to \n                                                          \n61  See S v Makwanyane 1995 6 BCLR 665 (CC) para 328. \n62 Haysom "Dignity" para 5.2.1.  \n63 Haysom "Dignity" para 5.2.1. \n64 Haysom "Dignity" para 5.2.2. \n65 Rautenbach "Bill of Rights" para 1A57.1. \n66 Rautenbach "Bill of Rights" para 1A58.1. \n67 Haysom "Dignity" para 5.2.2. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2422 \navoid practices and disciplinary policies that cause harm, mistreatment or humiliation \nto learners. Self-confidence and self-expression must be promoted and \nencouraged.68 \nMoreover, the Constitution of Germany expressly provides for the right to equality \nand the right to dignity and will be discussed below. It is wise to first discuss the \nGerman school system, as the discussion will provide the necessary background \ninformation on how a tripartite school system functions. A school system similar to \nthe German school system will be proposed for South Africa, and the German school \nsystem can therefore be used as a framework. \n3 The right to (basic) education in Germany – a brief overview \nEs gibt nur eine Sache auf der Welt, die teurer ist als Bildung: keine Bildung!69 \nGermany has a Constitution that is similar to the South African Constitution. Chapter \n1 of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland),70 \nalso known as the Basic Law, consists of basic rights (die Grundrechte) and \npromotes and encourages the values of human dignity, equality and liberty.71 \nArticle 1 (human dignity) of the German Constitution emphasises the importance of \nhuman dignity: \n(1) Die Würde des Menschen ist unantastbar. Sie zu achten und zu schützen ist \nVerpflichtung aller staatlichen Gewalt. \n(2) Das Deutsche Volk bekennt sich darum zu unverletzlichen und \nunveräußerlichen Menschenrechten als Grundlage jeder menschlichen \nGemeinschaft, des Friedens und der Gerechtigkeit in der Welt. \nIn other words, article 1 makes it clear that: \n(1) Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty \nof all state authority. \n                                                          \n68 NESRI 2014/2015 https://www.nesri.org/programs/what-is-the-human-right-to-education. \n68 Haysom "Dignity" para 5.2.1. \n69 Said by JF Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States of America. It can be translated as \nthere is only one thing in the world which is more expensive than education: no education! \n70 The German Constitution is also known as the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany \n(Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland R1). \n71 Robbers German Law 44. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2423 \n(2) The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human \nrights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world.72 \nArticle 3 (Equality) of the German Constitution provides that: \n(1) Alle Menschen sind vor dem Gesetz gleich. \n(2) Männer und Frauen sind gleichberechtigt. Der Staat fördert die \ntatsächliche Durchsetzung der Gleichberechtigung von Frauen und \nMännern und wirkt auf die Beseitigung bestehender Nachteile hin. \n(3) Niemand darf wegen seines Geschlechtes, seiner Abstammung, seiner \nRasse, seiner Sprache, seiner Heimat und Herkunft, seines Glaubens, \nseiner religiösen oder politischen Anschauungen benachteiligt oder \nbevorzugt werden. Niemand darf wegen seiner Behinderung \nbenachteiligt werden. \nThus, article 3 emphasises the importance of the right to equality by providing that: \n(1) All persons shall be equal before the law. \n(2) Men and women shall have equal rights. The state shall promote the \nactual implementation of equal rights for women and men and take \nsteps to eliminate disadvantages that now exist. \n(3) No person shall be favoured or disfavoured because of gender, \nparentage, race, language, homeland and origin, faith, or religious or \npolitical opinions. No person shall be disfavoured because of \ndisability.73 \nMoreover, Germany has a written Constitution, codified in a single document. \nGermany has sixteen different states and each state also has its own state \nConstitution, which is partly modelled on the Basic Law, but each state Constitution \nalso has an identity of its own. However, in terms of article 28 (the principle of \nhomogeneity), all state Constitutions are obliged to comply with the fundamental \nprinciples of the Basic Law.74 \nThe development of the German school system varied from that of other European \ncountries, inter alia because of the unification of East and West Germany. The \n                                                          \n72 See, in general, Battis and Gusy Staatsrecht 234-241; also see Bundesrepublik Deutschland 2015 \nhttp://www.dejure.org/gesetze/GG. \n73 See, in general, Battis and Gusy Staatsrecht 234-241; also see Bundesrepublik Deutschland 2015 \nhttp://www.dejure.org/gesetze/GG. \n74 Robbers German Law 44. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2424 \nUnification Treaty (Einigungsvertrag) was concluded between the Federal Republic \nof Germany and the German Democratic Republic in 1990 and brought unity in the \nareas of culture, education and science. Fundamental provisions are included in this \ntreaty in order to establish a common, comparable basic structure in education – \nspecifically in the German school system. It is important to remember that each \nstate has its own Constitution, which means that each state has its own educational \nlegislation and educational administration. In other words, a federal principle with \nregard to educational policy is followed. This means that the educational legislation \nand educational administration are primarily the responsibility of each state. The \nfederal government therefore plays only a subordinate role. However, under the \nBasic Law and the Constitutions of each state, the entire German school system is \nunder the supervision of the state as stipulated in article 7 of the German \nConstitution.75 \nHowever, the right to education, and more specifically the right to basic education, \nare not explicitly provided for in the German Constitution, although it is regarded as \nan important basic right. There are several ongoing debates and demands with \nregard to human rights and one of the demands is to explicitly enshrine the right to \neducation in the Basic Law.76 Nevertheless, article 5(3) of the Constitution stipulates \nthat: \n...arts and sciences, research and teaching shall be free. The freedom of teaching \nshall not release any person from allegiance to the constitution. \nArticle 7 of the Constitution states that the entire German school system shall be \nunder the supervision of the state. It also provides for the right of parents and \nguardians to decide whether or not their children shall receive religious instruction. \nThe right to establish private schools is also guaranteed in this section. \nTitle Eight of the Social Code77 is also important with regard to the right to \neducation, since this code: \n                                                          \n75 Hörner et al Education Systems 302. \n76 Kunze Recht auf Bildung 93. \n77 Sozialgesetzbuch VIII [SGB VIII], Dec 8, 1998, BGBl I 3456.

Compulsory education can be divided into two parts, namely:78 \n(a) Full-time compulsory education. This education lasts for a period of ten \nyears.79 Children attend four years80 of primary school and thereafter \neducation in comprehensive schools which are also known as "secondaryschool\nstage I". These schools are divided into secondary general schools, \nintermediate schools and grammar schools.81 Therefore, within this selection \nof schools, learners can complete their compulsory full-time education. \n(b) Continued compulsory schooling in secondary school, which is also known as \n"secondary-school stage II". These schools mainly consist of vocational \nschools. \nMoreover, since 2012 career orientation has become compulsory for all learners and \nbegins at the age of 14 years. This orientation forms part of all school subjects, with \nan emphasis on individualised approaches. Thus, the process of career and academic \norientation in the German education system can be illustrated as in Table 3:82 \nTable 3: Process of career/academic orientation in the German education \nsystem \nIdentification \nof learners\' \npotentials and \nexploration of \noccupational \nareas: \nPractical \ntraining / \ninternships: \nDecision \nmaking and \nthe \narrangement \nof the \ntransition: \nExploration of \nacademic \npaths: \nDecision \nmaking and \nthe \narrangement \nof the \ntransition: \n                                                          \n78 Rose and Beutner 2014 http://evive.eduproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/EVive_Educational-VETSystem-in-Germany.pdf\n2-3. \n79 This may vary from state to state. For example, the state of Bavaria is different. \n80 This varies from state to state. For example, primary school lasts for 6 years in the states of \nBerlin and Brandenburg. \n81  This may vary from state to state, since some states also have an alternative to the traditional \nthree-tier school system, namely "die Gesamtschule".  \n82 Rose and Beutner 2014 http://evive.eduproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/EVive_Educational-VETSystem-in-Germany.pdf\n2-3. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2426 \n"FORM 8" "FORM 9" "FORM 9/10" SECONDARY \nSCHOOL II \nSECONDARY \nSCHOOL II \nAnalysis of a \nstudent\'s \ncapabilities and \nthe exploration \nof vocational \nareas \nPractical phases \n \nExtension or \nconsolidation of \npractical \nexperiences \n(Job) \nApplication, \nattendance of \nthe transition \n \nDefine core \nareas for \nvocational / \nsecondary \nschool \nReviewing of the \nlearner\'s abilities \nto study at a \nuniversity and \ngather practical \nexperiences \nThe process of \nenrolment, job \napplication and \nthe arrangement \nof the transition \nis started \nTable 3 thus emphasises the importance of the core elements of career orientation. \nThese elements are of importance for the design and aim of the German schoolspecific\nprocess of career and academic orientation. In a nutshell – the three most \nimportant steps pertaining to career orientation are as follows: \n(a) Firstly, individual potentials, aptitudes and career possibilities are identified. \n(b) Secondly, specific employment opportunities are explored and considered. \n(c) Thirdly, a decision is made in respect of the individual\'s career path. \nIt is clear from the above that the German education system equips each learner \nwith the necessary knowledge and information in respect of his/her career \nopportunities. Moreover, career orientation at school level has become more and \nmore important, since it provides the learner with concise and accurate information \npertaining to career opportunities; it encourages confidence when career decisions \nneed to be made; and such career orientation contributes to a more effective and \nproductive workforce, as the learner is already aware of what the career entails. \n4 South Africa and Germany: A brief comparison \nIn South Africa, section 3(1) of the South African Schools Act83 stipulates that \nschooling is compulsory for children aged seven to 15 years or attendance in Grades \n                                                          \n83 South African Schools Act 84 of 1996. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2427 \n1 to 9, whichever comes first.

This is also known as "reception" or Grade R. Grades 1 to 9 are \ncompulsory for all children and are categorised as General Education and Training \n(GET). Grades 11 and 12 are known as Further Education and Training (FET) and \nare not compulsory. However, on completion of Grade 12, learners receive a \nmatriculation certificate which is required to enter tertiary/higher education \n(university). \nIn Germany, the Basic Law (Grundgesetz – RI) and the Constitutions of the Federal \nStates (Länder) (R12-27) have several fundamental provisions pertaining to schools \nthat also have a bearing and impact on primary schools. The legal basis for the \nGrundschule, also known as the first compulsory schooling for all children, can be \nfound in the Education Acts (R85, R87, R89, R91, R93, R96, R98, R100, R102-103, \nR105, R107, R113, R115-117), the Compulsory Schooling Acts (R108) and the \nSchulordnungen (school regulations). These Acts are enacted by the German \nMinistries of Education and Cultural Affairs in the Länder.87 \n4.1 The education/school system in Germany \nJeder Mensch hat das Recht auf Bildung.88 \n4.1.1 A short history \nThe Second World War had an enormous impact on the German education system. \nNot only were universities and schools destroyed, but the education system was \nplagued by a shortage of teachers and resources. Moreover, the Cold War divided \nGermany between the two opposing blocs and a multitude of valuable educational \ntalents were lost, since many Jewish scholars had been driven from their positions \nby the Nazis. At this time the education systems of East Germany and the Soviet \nsector of Berlin were reformed. The reforms were often referred to as the \n                                                          \n87 Lohmar and Eckhardt Education in Germany 103. \n88 Article 26 of the Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte  (Universal Declaration of Human \nRights (1948)) which states that everyone has a right to education. Also see the discussion in \npara 6.1 below. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2429 \n"Sovietisation of education". In 1945 the Soviet military authority established the \nGerman Central Administration for National Education and administered the \nelimination of private schools in East Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin.89 The \ncurrent German school system will be discussed below. \n4.1.2 Grundschule (primary school) \nFrom Grades 1 to 4, all children attend Grundschule, where the basic skills and \nknowledge are taught to them.90 The main purpose of the Grundschule is to \npromote, advance and foster children with diverse individual learning backgrounds \nand learning aptitudes and capabilities. In this context children are provided with a \nsolid basis for independent thinking, reasoning, learning and working. Moreover, the \nGrundschule aims to provide its children with the necessary basis for the next level \nof education as well as for lifelong learning.91 From Grade 5 and onwards children \nare evaluated for the next level of schooling. In other words, children are separated \ninto "different" schools according to their academic performance and the wishes of \ntheir families.92 These schools can be divided into three different types of schools, \nnamely: Hauptschule, Realschule and Gymnasium. There is also an alternative to \nthese schools, namely the Gesamtschule, which will be discussed in paragraph 4.1.4 \nbelow. \n4.1.3 The tripartite system of secondary schools in Germany \n4.1.3.1 The Hauptschule (basic general education) \nThe Hauptschule is for learners who want to do an apprenticeship after leaving \nschool. Learners are prepared for "working life", and practical knowledge and skills \nare emphasised and encouraged. Learning also takes place at a slower pace. Most \nlearners also attend vocation-oriented courses/modules once or twice a week by \ndoing an internship at a company. Vocational education in Germany is recognised \n                                                          \n89 Andell 2008 MJ 16. \n90 Grundschule lasts for six years in Berlin and Brandenburg. \n91 Lohmar and Eckhardt Education in Germany 103. \n92 Plötzgen Bildungssystems 37-44. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2430 \ninternationally and is also to the benefit of the particular learners, because learning \nand education occur at more than one place.93 \nThe Hauptschule lasts for five years94 and after completion of the Hauptschule, \nlearners receive a "Hauptschulabschluss". This is also known as a school-leaving \ncertificate, which is awarded to learners who graduate from a Hauptschule.95 \nIn this way, practical and theoretical training are optimally linked and learners are \nadequately prepared to successfully enter the world of work. Examples of \napprenticeships are those for electricians, mechanics, salespeople and office clerks. \n4.1.3.2 The Realschule (more extensive general education) \nThe Realschule makes provision for extended general education. Learners are \ntrained to flourish in mid-level jobs/careers. Learners are also allowed to learn a \nsecond foreign language and they learn more independently than in the \nHauptschule. The Mittlere Reife is the school-leaving certificate which is awarded to \nlearners who have completed the Realschule. It is usually awarded after ten years of \nschooling.96 \n4.1.3.3 Das Gymnasium (intensified general education) \nThe Gymnasium makes provision for advanced general education. This type of \nschool prepares learners for university or for dual academic and vocational \ncredentials. Subjects such as German, foreign languages, mathematics, science and \nhistory are learnt through the Gymnasium. Two foreign languages are also learnt. \nLearners attend this school for eight or nine years before they can write the final \nexamination, the Abitur in their Grade 12 or 13. The Abitur is an examination of vital \nimportance in order to gain university admission/entrance.97 Once a learner has \n                                                          \n93 Plötzgen Bildungssystems 37-44; also see Andell 2008 MJ 16-17. \n94 This may also vary from state to state. \n95 Andell 2008 MJ 16-17. \n96 Brenner Schule in Deutschland 44-46. \n97 Rösner Schulsystem in Deutschland 74-75. \n', "C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2431 \ncompleted Realschule or Hauptschule, there are several ways he/she can continue \nhis/her secondary education in order to eventually pass the Abitur.98 \n4.1.4 Die Gesamtschule: An alternative to the traditional three-tier school system \nThis type of school is also known as a comprehensive school. Despite children's \ndifferent performances, these children are not divided into the tripartite system of \nsecondary schools. Instruction/education is given collectively to these children. \nA distinction is also made between two types of Gesamtschulen (comprehensive \nschools), namely cooperative comprehensive schools and integrated comprehensive \nschools. The cooperative comprehensive Gesamtschulen's main goal is to make the \ntransmission between the Hauptschule, Realschule and Gymnasium easier and \nuncomplicated by merging/uniting the three tracks in the same school. The \nintegrated comprehensive Gesamtschulen can be described as integrated, since the \nmerging/uniting of the Hauptschule, Realschule and Gymnasium is educationally and \norganisationally cohesive.99 \nThe Hauptschule, Realschule and Gymnasium offer a single course of education, \nwhich means that this course of education is related to a certain school-leaving \ncertificate.100 \n4.1.5 Compulsory curricula in Germany \nIn Germany (in all Länder), compulsory curricula exist for all subjects in all types of \ncompulsory schools (see Table 5).101 \n                                                          \n98 Rösner Schulsystem in Deutschland 74-75. \n99  Andell 2008 MJ 16 17. \n100  There are also additional/alternative school types in different Länder (states), which offer several \ncourses of education. They are: Werkrealschule (Baden-Württemberg); Mittelschule, \nWirtschaftsschule (Bayern); Integrierte Sekundarschule (Berlin); Oberschule (Brandenburg); \nSekundarschule, Oberschule (Bremen); Haupt- und Realschule, Stadtteilschule (Hamburg); \nVerbundene Haupt- und Realschule, Mittelstufenschule, Förderstufe (Hessen); Regionale Schule \n(Mecklenburg-Vorpomern); Oberschule (Niedersachsen); Realschule plus (Rheinland-Pfalz); \nErweiterte Realschule, Gemeinschaftsschule (Saarland); Mittelschule (Sachsen); Sekundarschule \n(Sachsen-Anhalt); Gemeinschaftsschule, Regionalschule (Schleswig-Holstein); Regelschule, \nGemeinschaftsschule (Thüringen). \n101 Lohmar and Eckhardt Education in Germany 117-118. \n", "C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2432 \nTable 5: Compulsory curricula for all compulsory schools \nPhase Age range Subjects studied \nPrimary education 6-10 (6-12 in the Länder \nof Berlin and Bradenburg) \nIncludes, in most Länder: German, \nmathematics, Sachunterricht \n(interdisciplinary subject providing an \nintroduction to economics, social \nstudies, history, geography, science \nand technology), art, sport, music and, \nincreasingly, a modern foreign \nlanguage from around Year 3 (at the \nage of 8-9 years)  \nLower-secondary \neducation \n10-15/16 (or 12-15/16, \ndepending on the Land) \nSubjects may vary between Land and \nschool type, but usually include the \nfollowing: German, mathematics, social \nstudies, history, geography, biology, \nchemistry, physics, art, music, sport, \nand one or more modern foreign \nlanguages \nUpper-secondary \neducation \n15/16+ to 18/19 The curriculum followed by these \nlearners depends on the type of \ninstitution a student attends and the \ncourse he or she is studying \nThus, the basic education system in Germany aims to achieve the following: to carry \nchildren forward from learning-by-playing at preschool level to more systematic \nforms of school learning, and to seek to adapt the subject matter taught and \nmethods employed to the learners' requirements and capabilities. The Grundschule \nlays the foundations for secondary education. It endeavours to provide learners with \na structured understanding of the impressions they gain from the world around them \nand to develop their psychomotor abilities and patterns of social behaviour. \nFurthermore, the most important goals with regard to basic education are: \n...to make learning as effective as possible for every child and, in this way, to \nensure equality of opportunity from the very beginning of organized instruction.102 \nThere is thus a strong emphasis on child-centred methods of learning, which \nemphasis attempts to provide a favourable learning environment with wide-ranging \n                                                          \n102 Woodill, Bernhard and Prochner Early Childhood Education 224. \n", 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2433 \nexperiences and practices that will support and promote the development of the \nwhole child.103 \nTo summarise: The Grundschule, Hauptschule, Gymnasium and Gesamtschule strive \nto achieve the following objectives:104 \n(a) to promote the full intellectual, emotional and physical development of \nchildren (Children are taught how to be independent, how to make informed \ndecisions and how to deal with personal, social and political responsibility.); \n(b) to provide the necessary education in accordance with the child\'s academic \nknowledge and also taking into consideration age-related conceptual faculties; \n(c) to increase the degree of specialisation by considering every child\'s abilities \nand inclinations; and \n(d) to maintain an open education system that permits transfers from one type of \nschool to another type of school after an orientation phase. \n4.1.6 Vocational Education and Training (VET) at upper-secondary level \nThe VET system is described as a dual system, since training is done in two places of \nlearning, namely at companies and at vocational schools. The duration of training is \nnormally three years but it may vary from state to state.105 \nThe aim of "dual training" is to provide basic vocational training, qualifications and \ncompetences which are required to "practise an occupation as a skilled worker in a \nchanging world of work". The successful completion of this kind of training enables \nthe trainee to practise an occupation as a qualified, skilled worker. There are \ncurrently 346 recognised training occupations. The only requirement for VET is the \ncompletion of compulsory full-time education.106 \n                                                          \n103 Woodill, Bernhard and Prochner Early Childhood Education 224. \n104 Lohmar and Eckhardt Education in Germany 113. \n105 Hippach-Schneider, Krause and Woll Vocational Education 24-26. \n106 Hippach-Schneider, Krause and Woll Vocational Education 24-26. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2434 \n4.1.7 Criticism of the German tripartite education system \nThere is of course (as with any other education system in the world) also criticism of \nthe tripartite education system of Germany. The most important criticism levelled at \nthis system is the existence of possible social inequality on the basis of social \nbackground, language and immigrant status.107 Another point of criticism levelled at \nthe tripartite education system was that children were separated too early and \nshould have been separated at a later age. In response to this, Chancellor Angela \nMerkel argued that the results of the Programme for International Student \nAssessment (PISA) were not proof that the tripartite education system was at fault. \nIn other words, the criticism could not be ascribed to a tripartite system error, but \nhad to be attributed to human mistake(s), and these can certainly be remedied and \nresolved.108 Since the criticism, Germany has focused on reforming its education \nsystem. \nDespite the criticism, Germany still has one of the world\'s top education systems. \nGermany is currently eighth in The World Top 20 Education Poll 2014 Final \nRankings.109 Moreover, Germany is (owing to its school system) one of today\'s \nleading industrial nations. One should remember the following:110 \nIt was Germany that first developed the modern research university. In Germany, \nthey found in the Gymnasium a model for secondary schools designed to prepare \nstudents for the modern research university. And it was Germany that provided in \nthe Realschule and – later in the dual system – two of the world\'s most compelling \nmodels for supplying a nation with highly trained workers in every field of \nendeavour. \n                                                          \n107 This was according to the PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) undertaken by \nthe OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) at schools in participating \ncountries.

The main purpose of this project is "to assure that every child on the \nplanet has an opportunity to reach their full potential, with access to quality education in a safe \nand nurturing environment". See World Top 20 2014 http://www.worldtop20.org. \n110 OECD 2010 http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/46581323.pdf 202. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2435 \nMoreover, Germany\'s flexible and adaptable combination of formal schooling \ntogether with the VET system signifies a very powerful and influential approach to \nprovide learners with "skills, knowledge and motivation that could prove decisive on \na national scale in international competition".111 \nGermany is also often referred to as Europe’s economic engine and its success in \nthis sphere is based mainly on the quality, excellence, creativity, skill and dexterity \nof its labour force.112 It is submitted that this can be directly attributed to the \ncountry\'s education system, which caters for learning differences. \n4.2 The education/school system in South Africa \nThe school system in South Africa can be described as a "mainstream" school \nsystem. This means that, from Grades 1 to 7, all children attend primary school and, \nfrom Grade 8 and onwards, children attend high school (secondary school). Children \nare not separated into "different" schools according to their academic \nperformance,113 since the main focus is on inclusive, Outcomes-based Education \n(OBE).114 However, this system is in the process of being revised, improved and \nrenamed as "Schooling 2025". Schooling 2025 is a new action plan to improve the \neducation system in South African schools. It aims to improve and promote all \naspects pertaining to education, such as teacher recruitment, learner enrolment, \nschool funding, mass literacy and numeracy, and the overall quality of education. \nThis new action plan (this new curriculum) will enable learners to be educated in \ntheir mother tongues for the first three years of their schooling. English will still be a \ncompulsory subject, but will not replace the mother tongue or home language in the \nearly grades. Each grade will have its own study programme.115 The plan seems to \nfavour a strong bilingual education and mother tongue-based multilingual education \nmodel where instruction or academic content is taught in a home language (mother \n                                                          \n111 OECD 2010 http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/46581323.pdf 202, 214. \n112 OECD 2010 http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/46581323.pdf 202, 215. \n113 It is important to note that provision is made for special schools where disabled children are able \nto receive education. \n114 OBE can be described as "an approach to learning that seeks to link education more closely to \nthe real world, giving students skills to access, criticize, analyse and practically apply knowledge, \nrather than simply absorb and repeat it parrot-fashion".

CAPS \nprovides clear guidelines and directives on what educators (teachers) should teach \nand assess on a grade-by-grade and subject basis.117 CAPS is defined as follows:118 \nA National Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement is a single, comprehensive, \nand concise policy document, which will replace the current Subject and Learning \nArea Statements, Learning Programme Guidelines and Subject Assessment \nGuidelines for all the subjects listed in the National Curriculum Statement Grades R–\n12. \nThe Department of Basic Education is responsible for the implementation of CAPS. \nThe implementation has already taken place. CAPS was implemented as follows:119 \n(a) In 2012 in the foundation phase (Grades 1-3) and Grade 10. \n(b) In 2013 in the intermediate phase (Grades 4-6) and Grade 11. \n(c) In 2014 in the final school year (Grade 12). \nFor the sake of completeness, it is necessary to give a brief overview of the school \nsystem in South-Africa. \n4.2.1 Pre-primary/preschool \nPreschools make provision for children between the ages of four and seven. These \nschools are normally divided into two grades, namely Grade R for children of four \nyears who turn five before 30 June, and Grade 1 for children of five years who turn \nsix before 30 June. Compulsory education begins in Grade 1, as already said. It is \n                                                          \n116 DoBE Realisation of Schooling 2025 12-14; also see Brown 2014 \nhttp://sites.miis.edu/katiebrown/files/2014/06/K-Brown-Best-Practices-Report.pdf 3-6; Malone \n2007 www.sil.org/sites/default/files/files/mtbmle_implications_for_policy.pdf. \n117 CAPS provides guidance for teachers with regard to week-by-week planning; it gives direction \nand guidance in terms of pacing and progression and it provides clear guidelines in terms of \nassessment requirements. \n118 DoBE 2011 http://www.education.gov.za/Curriculum/CurriculumAssessmentPolicyStatements/ \ntabid/419/Default.aspx. \n119 DoBE 2011 http://www.education.gov.za/Curriculum/CurriculumAssessmentPolicyStatements/ \ntabid/419/Default.aspx. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2437 \npermissible to enrol children in Grade R or Grade 1 a year later if the parents or \nguardian of the child believe that the child is not "school-ready". Some schools insist \nthat a child begin with Grade 1 only at the age of seven. The main focus areas of \nchildren\'s learning in preschools are literacy, numeracy and life skills. \n4.2.2 Primary school \nPrimary schools make provision for children from their reception year to Grade 6. \nThe reception year is non-compulsory and formal schooling starts in Grade 1. \nPrimary schools are divided into junior primary and senior primary. Junior-primary \nschooling continues for three years and children are taught basic subjects such as \nreading and writing, mathematics and, in most instances, are introduced to a second \nlanguage. Children between the ages of ten and twelve years attend senior-primary \nschool. Besides mathematics and language skills, these children learn subjects such \nas history, geography, life skills and science. Moreover, their writing and speaking \nskills in respect of a second language are also developed and expanded. \nAssessment in primary schools is conducted through Annual National Assessments \n(ANAs) and is unvarying across South Africa. Assessment takes place in literacy and \nnumeracy in the foundation stage (Grades 1-3) and in numeracy and languages in \nthe intermediate phase (Grades 4-6). \n4.2.3 Secondary school \nSecondary education is also divided into two phases, namely the junior and senior \nphases. Learners are allowed to study two or three languages, and secondary school \nalso enables learners to extend and intensify their knowledge of numerous academic \nsubjects. One can thus say that secondary education prepares and equips learners \nfor further study, which then enables them to follow a career of their choice. \nLearners study at least four subjects from the following areas: general studies, \ncommercial studies, the natural sciences, technical studies, the arts, agriculture, and \ndomestic science. Grades 10 to 12 are optional. \nFurthermore, certificates are awarded to learners who complete Grades 10 and 11, \nbut the National Senior Certificate (NSC) is awarded only when a learner completes \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2438 \nGrade 12. The NSC is the equivalent of a high-school diploma and is better known as \na matriculation or matric certificate. \nIn order to obtain an NSC, learners are obliged to take a minimum of six subjects. \nLearners are also permitted to add three additional subjects, but these three \nadditional subjects are non-compulsory. The compulsory subjects are two languages \n(the mother tongue plus an additional language), mathematics and life orientation. \nLearners have a choice of two (or more) other subjects. \nHowever, despite new plans and efforts to improve the school system, it seems that \nthe South African school system is still not functioning satisfactorily. It appears that \nmainstream education in South Africa does not work either, since the school system \ndoes not make provision for the needs of learners who cannot cope in mainstream \neducation nor does it make provision for children with specific skills, talents and \naptitudes. In other words, it seems that the current inclusive mainstream school \nsystem of South Africa does not cater satisfactorily for learning differences, which \nmeans that the system excludes some learners (with different aptitudes, skills, \ntalents and interests) from realising their right to a basic education to its fullest \nextent. The ripple effect of this is that there might be an infringement/violation of \nthese children\'s constitutional rights to equality and dignity. Furthermore, one needs \nto ask whether mainstream schooling is really in the best interests of the child as \nprovided for in section 28(2) of the Constitution, and whether it makes provision for \nchildren with "mainly practical talents" or children "whose predisposition lies \nbetween theoretical and practical extremes of the psychological range" to "compete" \nwith children "who are theoretically inclined"? The answer to these questions is that \nit does not.120 The reason for this is that children\'s aptitudes, skills and talents vary \nand equal educational opportunities (and the prevention of unfair discrimination) can \nbe promoted only when children follow different curricula in accordance with their \naptitudes, skills and talents and not on the basis of social background and/or race. \nFurthermore, high-school dropout rates in South Africa are evidence that the \n                                                          \n120 The answer(s) to the questions that were asked in para 2.2.

The participants \nare Leopard, Elephant, Turtle and Monkey. It is obvious that it is impossible for all of \nthe participants (especially the Elephant and Turtle) to climb a tree, since all the \nparticipants have different aptitudes, skills and talents. In other words, the \ncompetition is not in the best interests of all participants (all children), and nor does \nit make provision for all participants' rights to equality and dignity. \nThe question now is: What should or could be done in order to enhance learner \ndifferences? It is submitted that all children (learners), regardless of their social \nbackground and/or race, should be entitled to an education appropriate to their \nlearning needs, aptitudes, skills and talents. Children with different learning needs, \naptitudes, skills and talents need different curricula. \n5 A proposed school system for South Africa? \nThe success of any country, whether it is social, financial or economic success, \ndepends on how its citizens are educated. To put this differently: the performance \nand well-being of education (and school) systems worldwide have become an \nimportant indicator of a country's success or failure and have both economic and \nsocial importance when countries are seeking greater ecological sustainability and \ninclusive economic growth. It is, therefore, hard to imagine that any government \nwould not support and encourage a quality system of education for all. \nOn the basis of the above discussion, it appears that a system similar to Germany's \nschool system would be favourable for South Africa, since such a system gives better \neffect to the realisation and fulfilment of a child's right to a basic education, with \nspecific emphasis on the right to equality and the right to dignity. With regard to the \nright to equality, the German system does not focus solely on the equal treatment of \nevery child, but rather on promoting, protecting and respecting every child's equal \n                                                          \n121 See Table 1 above for dropout rates. \n", 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2440 \nworth. In other words, children have equal opportunities within the school and \neducation context, but in different ways (different curricula) according to their \naptitudes, skills and talents.122 With regard to dignity, it seems that the South \nAfrican school system does not sufficiently acknowledge the fact that each child is \nunique, with different learning needs (with specific reference to mainstream \neducation). It seems, therefore, that the German school system makes better \nprovision for children\'s different learning needs and the uniqueness of the individual \nto such an extent that every individual\'s (child\'s) potential and intrinsic worth are \npromoted, protected and respected to the best of the system\'s capacity.123 \nA proposed school system for South Africa would not need to be exactly like the \nGerman one, but the German tripartite school system could be used as a framework. \nIt is proposed that the following school system be considered in South Africa in \norder to realise a child\'s right to a basic education to its fullest extent:124 \n(1) School W (equivalent to the Grundschule) where all learners (children) attend \nGrades 1 to 4. During this stage, all the basic skills and knowledge are taught \nto them. \n(2) School X (equivalent to the Gymnasium) where provision is made for the \ntheoretically inclined learner (high academic performance) whose workrelated\nobjective is a "leading intellectual position". \n(3) School Y (equivalent to the Hauptschule) where provision is made for basic \ngeneral education for learners who mainly have practical skills and talents \n(technical, mechanical, entrepreneurial, etc.) and whose occupational \nobjective is an "instruction-following" position. Learners should also have the \nopportunity of acquiring an additional certificate in order to gain access to \nuniversity education. \n(4) School Z (equivalent to the Realschule) where provision is made for adequate \neducation for those learners whose "predisposition lies between the \n                                                          \n122 See the discussion on equality in para 2.4.1 above. \n123 See the discussion on dignity in para 2.4.2 above. \n124 Ertl and Phillips 2000 Brit J Educ Stud 394. \n', 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2441 \ntheoretical and practical extremes of the psychological range" and who aim \nfor careers/occupations with "increased responsibilities". Learners should also \nhave the opportunity of acquiring an additional certificate in order to gain \naccess to university education. \nHowever, there can still be comprehensive secondary schools (such as the \nGesamtschule) that any child can attend and which offer all the necessary subjects \nwith regard to the whole range of qualifications. \nOf course, the development of such a system is not without challenges and would be \nbound to attract criticism, but at least it would be an improvement. It is submitted \nthat the proposed South African school system would be better able to surmount \nbarriers such as discrimination on the basis of social background, language and \nimmigrant status (the biggest criticism levelled against the German tripartite \nsystem),125 since the South African Constitution explicitly prohibits such \ndiscrimination in terms of section 9, and South Africa is well advanced with the \napplication thereof, not only in schools, but also in the workforce. \nThe school system proposed for South Africa would strive to put the child first, and it \nwould have to be kept in mind that the different types of schools are to be designed \nto suit different children with different aptitudes, talents, skills (learning needs) and \ninterests, and not different social groups or different races or different languages. \nNo child should be forced into an academic education that bores the child to \nrebellion, or which causes huge amounts of stress or frustration, merely because \nthat type of school education is considered more socially desirable by society. \nIn conclusion, adopting a VET system similar to the German VET system126 would be \nhighly beneficial to South Africa, since it would reduce school dropout rates and \nunemployment rates. School leavers would have the opportunity to undertake VET \ntraining after the completion of compulsory schooling in order to start off with \nsuccessful occupations as highly skilled workers. A VET system would build skills \nsuch as: \n                                                          \n125 See the criticism levelled at the German tripartite education system in para 4.1.7 above. \n126 See para 4.1.6 for a discussion on the German VET system. \n', "C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2442 \n...the ability to set work goals, create plans to achieve them and working in a \ndisciplined way to implement and execute that plan, being an effective member or \nleader of a team and the ability to think analytically and creatively.127 \nThe adoption of VET would without a doubt strengthen the nation’s economic \nactivity. \n6 Conclusion \nThe South African education system is undoubtedly a high-cost, low-performance \nsystem where the full realisation of a child's right to a basic education is not \nsatisfactorily adhered to in terms of section 29 of the Constitution. Moreover, the \nbest interests of children in terms of section 28 of the Constitution are also not \npromoted adequately, and children's rights to equality and human dignity128 seem to \nbe infringed as well. The time is therefore ripe for a change in the system. Of \ncourse, such a change would not take place without problems and/or challenges, but \nwhen such change occurs step by step and systematically, it would be likely to \nsucceed. \nIt is obvious that the proposed school system would not work if there were \ninequalities of any nature.129 It is therefore also crucial that children be assessed and \nevaluated objectively and that the importance of objective and unbiased assessment \nand evaluation be promoted and encouraged.130 Moreover, the assessment and \nevaluation should not be based on a child's performance in tests and examinations \nonly, but also on the child's aptitude, skills, talents and interests. In addition, the \nsuccess of the proposed school system would depend on teachers being well trained \nfor teaching in such a system. It would accordingly be advantageous in future to \nemploy only newly qualified teachers who have been trained for teaching in a new \nschool system. \nFurthermore, the main purpose of the proposed school system in South Africa should \nbe the promotion, advancement and fostering of children with diverse individual \n                                                          \n127 OECD 2010 http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/46581323.pdf 214. \n128 See paras 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 above. \n129 See para 4.1.7 above. \n130 In other words, South Africa needs to create a welfare society with an emphasis on supporting \nevery individual regardless of economic or social background. \n", "C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2443 \nlearning backgrounds and learning aptitudes, skills, talents and interests. A culture \nof diligence should, in other words, be fostered: children have different abilities, but \nevery child can reach his/her educational goal – it might just require a different \nroute or a longer journey. When such a purpose is accomplished, children will be \nprovided with a solid basis of independent thinking, reasoning, learning and \nworking.131 Also, this would lead to a fuller realisation of the child's right to a basic \neducation, as well as his/her right to equality and human dignity, and it would also \nbe in the best interest of the child. \nThe proposed school system should strive to achieve the following goals:132 \n(a) to promote the full intellectual, emotional and physical development of \nchildren; \n(b) to provide satisfactory education in accordance with children's academic \nknowledge and prowess; \n(c) to increase the degree of specialisation with regard to children's aptitudes, \nskills, talents and learning differences; \n(d) to maintain an open education system that permits the transfer from one \nschool type to another school type after proper orientation; \n(e) to drastically improve teacher quality; and \n(f) to provide reports based on a continuous, data-based, problem-centred \nexamination of the South African education system. \nMoreover, such a school system in South Africa, like that of Germany, may serve as \na good instrument in: \n(a) empowering people to escape the poverty cycle and compete effectively in \nthe labour market; \n                                                          \n131 See para 4.1.2 above. \n132 See also para 4.1.5 above. \n", 'C CHÜRR   PER / PELJ 2015(18)7 \n2444 \n(b) enabling people to understand and enjoy their democratic values, rights and \nfreedoms; \n(c) encouraging people to participate in and protect the fledgling democratic \nsystem; and \n(d) most importantly, enhancing their dignity and feeling of self-worth as human \nbeings.133 \nLastly, it is submitted that the proposed school system would, to a much greater \nextent than the current South African school system, progressively realise the \nconstitutional rights specified in sections 7(2) and 29 of the South African \nConstitution. \nWhen children are educated, the following must always be remembered: \nEverybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live \nits whole life believing that it is stupid.134 \n                                                          \n133 Malherbe 2008 TSAR 274-275.
