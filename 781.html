It is reported that the\ninsurgent forces are moving toward Port Au Prince, which they\nclaim that they will easily capture, and a sense of impending ca-\nlamity hangs over the people of this city. The revolutionists are\nbut twenty-five or thirty miles distant at this time.\nThe situation has become so grave that an official proclamation\nhas been issued convoking the chambers in extraordinary session\nso that measures may be taken to preserve the government, or at\nleast effect a compromise with the revolutionary leaders. There\nwas grave fear tonight that the disagreed body of Haytlens here\nmight take up arms for the ovei throw of the government, which, 4\nhowever, has taken precautions against this happening. Through-\nout the day and tonight the streets were patrolled !y bodies of 4i\ntroops who maintained order. Three divisions of troops are en-\ntrenched several miles outside the city and it is not expected Gen-\neral Simons\' force will reach the cross roads until probably Wed- \'\nnesday. \'\nThe vanguard of the revolutionists occupied Grand Coave, a\ntown of 16,000 Inhabitants about thirty miles west of this city,\nwithout firing a shot. It is expected this force will be sent ahead\nto clear the way if any obstruction is offered. The French train-\ning ship Guguy Trouin has gone to Petit Coave at the earnest\nrequest of the French colony there who fear disorder. She will\nmake a general survey of the situation, and act as a guard vessel.\nThe Haytien gunboat Nord Alexis left here tonight to bombard\none of the ports held by the revolutionists. 4\nDEADLY\nFREIGHT\nWRECK\nREDDING (Cal.), Nov. 30.\nCharles Fletcher was killed and two\nother men seriously injured today\nwhen twelve cars of a south-bound\nfreight went into the ditch near\nDelta.

The iron\nbucket operated in the 500-foot shaft\nleading to the Rachel and Agnes\nmines of the Pittsburg-Buffalo Coal\ncompany at Marlanna, Pennsylvania,\nsince last Saturday when a terlrflc\nexplosion wrecked the up-to-date\nelevator, and snuffed out the lives of\nat least 120 miners, had carried to\nthe surface when darkness fell to\nnight, the bruised and mangled and\nburned remains of more than 100\nvictims of the disaster. The most re\nliable count of the bodies recovered\nat that time was 110, two thirds of\nwhich had been identifled.( The gen\neral belief is that by noon tomorrow\nall the victims will be brought to the\nsurface.\nBflitaiii is\nApprehensive\nKboof Mia\n(Associated Press.)\nLONDON, Nov. 30. Affairs in India have assumed a grave as-\npect, and though there is a sharp difference of opinion as to the\norigin of the difficulties, none exists as to the extent and menace\nof sedition. Special importance is attached to the possibility sug-\ngested in connection with the demand of Lord Roberts for an\narmy of a million men that if Germany found a large part of the\npresent British forces transferred to India to quell a rebellion she\nmight consider the time ripe for an act which those who march\nwith Roberts in the discussion consider only a question of Ber-\nlin\'s opportunity.\nAmid the confusing and often conflicting reports from Calcutta\nand Bengal, several facts are .clear. Whole provinces are disaf-\nfected to a degree not reached since the mutiny of 1857. The\nconspiracy to establish a reign of terror in Bengal has obtained a\nstrong footing.\nThe methods of procedure of the Indian judiciary, especially in\nthe lower courts, have ceased to command the confidence of the\nnatives. The large student population, thrown by recent events\ninto a state of intense excitement, is in close co-operation with\nthe revolutionary agents. The police conditions invite crime.\nThis is the threatening situation and it is not made less forraid-\nable by the evidence that the sedition mongers have found highly\nreceptive soil in the ranks of the native troops.\nThe best London opinion is that the fault lies not with John\nMorley at the Indian office, but with Lord Minto at Calcutta, and\nwith his lieutenants in the Indian administration. In their desire\nto conciliate native opinion they have sacrificed firmness to\nkindness and given an impression of weak and inefficient control.\nENGAGED IN A\nPISTOL DUEL IN\nPHILADELPHIA\n(By Associated Press.)\nPHILADELPHIA, Nov. 30. Rich\nard Burke, a bystander, was probably\nfatally wounded and Andrew Loner\ngan shot in the arm, in an exciting\npistol fight with George Medway in\nfront of the Bellevue-Stratford hotel\non Broad street here tonight. Ac\ncording to the officials, Longeran and\nMedway had a dispute Saturday night\nover the proceeds from the sale of\ntickets for the army-navy football\ngame, which they had been "scalp\ning" together. The men met tonight\nand the fight was renewed.\nINTERNATIONAL TIN PLATE\nCOMBINE ORGANIZED\nLONDON, Nov. 30. The Iron and\nSteel Trades Journal states that Eng\nlish and American tin-plate manu\nfacturers in London today formed a\ncombine which practically will con\ntrol the industry throughout the\nworld.\nNEW VANDERBILT GIFT TO YALE\nNEW HAVEN, Nov. 30. A gift of\n$50,000 from Frederick W. Vander\nbllt for the purchase of additional\nproperty for the enlargement of Van\nderbllt square, now occupied by the\ntwo Vanderbilt dormitories, is an\nnounced today.\nTHE MARKETS\nSOME INDECISION\n(By Associated Press.)\nNEW YORK, Nov. 30. Indecision\nmarked the speculative sentiment of\nthe stock market today. Price move\nment was extraordinarily active in\nspeculation. On the other hand,\nthere was a persistent selling of\nUnited States steel. The most con\nspicuous of the opposing movements\ntoday were St. Paul railway and\nUnited States steel. A feature of the\nday of wider financial significance\nwas the evidence of capital require\nments opening before the markets.\nThe, announcement of the sale of 50,\n000,000 American Telephone and\nTelegraph company convertible bonds\nto bankers seemed unexpected, and\nwas of portentious effect on market\nsentiment. Bonds were easy.\nSILVER GOES UP.\nNEW YORK, Nov. 30 Lead,\ndull, 4.25 4.30; copper, dull,\n14.37 14.50; silver, 48 3-8.\nTHE ATLANTIC FLEET.\nMiss Grace Maxwell, formerly with\nthe Butler theater, leaves this morn\ning for Los Angeles, where she has\naccepted an engagemnt with a theat\nrical company.\nTHE HONK0E\nDOCTRINE Of\nTHE PAOfflC\nDiplomatic Notes Exchanged\nby America and Japan Re\ngarding Future Policies\nRelating to the Far East\n(By Associated Press.)\nWASHINGTON, Nov. 30. Secretary of State Elihu Root, on be-\nhalf of the United States, and Ambassador Takahira, on behalf of\nJapan, this afternoon exchanged diplomatic notes defining the\npolicy of the two government in the far east. The declaration is\nnot a treaty, but simply a reaffirmation of what both Japan and\nthe United States stood for in China and the far east generally.\nIt has no legal standing, but its greatest benefit will be that de-\nrived from the moral effect It will exercise in the future govern-\nment of the far east. In this respect it has been likened to the\nMonroe doctrine in American history.\'\nIt is stated that the agreement between the United States and\nJapan has progressed to the point of actual signature of the\nagreement, thus indicating a tacit acquiescence in the course by\nthe other nations having large interests in the far east, marks, so\ndiplomatic officials assert, a decided step in the solution of the\n. eastern question. The American government has fully sounded\nthe nations of the world having interests in Asia as to their atti-\ntude on the subject of the new agreement. These included the\ngovernments which heartily gave their assurances to the open\ndoor policy so warmly advocated and consistently urged by John\nHay while secretary of state.\nHaying reached an entire accord on the principles of the\nagreement, all that remains to be done is to agree on the text.\nThis work has made splendid progress, and it was said at the state\ndepartment today tnat In all probability the agreement would\n\' soon be made public.\nThe agreement reached between Japan and the United States is\nthe culminations of a\' long line of conventions, treaties and under-\nstandings between the two countries, dating back to the controv-\nersy over the Japanese school question in San Francisco, which\nfor a time in the minds of some people, threatened a rupture of\nthe friendly relations of the two countries. That was . settled\namicably. Later there was a copyright and trade mark conven-\ntion, an arbitration treaty, a prompt answer to an invitation by\nJapan to participate in the Tokio exhibition, and last of all, the\nvisit of the battleship fleet. The rapid succession of these events\nin the minds of the state department officials has but tended to\nstrengthen the good feeling between the two nations, which is now\nvitalized.\nA MINER\nKILLED\nBY FALL\n(By Associated Preos.)\nREDDING (Cal.), Nov. 30. Rob\nert Ganol, a miner, was killed in the\nBalakala mine near Corum today by\nthe breaking of a cable.

E. Davis.)\nThe Clifford district looks all to\nthe good. The writer visited this\nnew-old district, which has created so\nmuch interest in southern Nevada\nsince it passed into the hands of J.\nC. McCormack on the twenty-third of\nSeptember, and knowing that but a\nshort month ago there was but the\ndevelopment work and a short shaft\nput down by the Cliffords, and a\nsmall shack or two, in the central\npart of the district, and merely a\nfew prospect holes in other parts, he\nwas agreeably surprised to find a\ntown of some eighty-five structures,\nsome of them tents, some tent\nhouses, and others large consider\ning the age of the district struct\nures of substantial frame construc\ntion not only substantial but warm;\na big gasoline hoist puffing away on\none of the leases, and some fourteen\nshafts being put down with all pos\nsible speed by leasors, exclusive of\nthe shaft on the central, or Broken\nHills mine, which is the property of\nMr. McCormack and a few associates.\nTwo large frame buildings are in\nprogress of construction for mercan\ntile firms, and on the way into Clif\nford our party passed seven big loads\nof lumber, tenting and other sup\nplies which presage the beginning of\nnew homes and business houses and\nthe opening of other leases before\nthe end of another week. And the\nbig Pope car of Mr. McCormack went\nby way of Salsberry Wash, and not\nby the McKinney station road, and\non which, we learned, were even\nmore teams than on the road we\ntraveled. The ore teams go by way\nof McKinney\'s, on account of its\nwatering accommodations. They all\ngo back loaded with supplies, and the\nlarger part of the people who are go\ning to Clifford to try to wrest from\nthe desert some of its carefully hid\nden riches go by the same route.\nImagine, if you will, a long, wide\nvalley, seemingly level as a floor,\nwith the rugged Kawich range to the\neast, and a smaller tributary range,\nrough and jagged, forming its\nnorthern boundary. Just a little to\nthe north and east of the center of\nthis valley is a small eminence, and\nto the west of this the new town of\nHelena. Back to the south is a long\nstretch of rolling country, part of the\nfloor of the Ralston desert, and\nwhich for miles bears a luxuriant\ngrowth of bunch grass which affords\nfeed for droves of cattle which are\nherded along the Stone Cabin creek,\na pretty little stream even now, when\nits fringing willows are bare and sere\nand the stream itself locked in the\nicy embrace of near-winter. Such is\nthe location of Helena.\nThe Broken Hills Mining com\npany\'s property, upon which the Clif\nfords made the original find of the\ndistrict, is the property which has\ngiven the district and town Us phe\nnomenal growth. In the crown of\nthe hill the Cliffords first prospected,\nand then sunk a couple of shafts,\none on \'an incline for some seventy\nfive feet, the other to the east and\nvertical for about fifty feet in depth.\nThey found rich milling ore, and\nthrew most of it on the dumps, not\nbeing able to ship the same and de\nvelop the property. It has long been\nknown that they had a rich milling\nproposition there, and when the news\nwas flashed over the country that J.\nC. McCormack of Goldfield had pur\nchased the mine for $350,000, a sen\nsation was caused for two reasons.\nFirst, it was regarded as a harbinger\nof good times, after the recent de\npression, and that it meant the de-\nDon\'t send out of town for your holiday\nbooks.

About the fifteenth of Octo\nber McCormack\'s men actually began\nwork on the old incline shaft which\nhad been started by the Cliffords.\nThis was run some further, and at\nthe same time, after careful exami\nnations had been made, McCormack\'s\nmen began sacking and shipping\nmuch of the ore that had been\nthrown on the dumps. Ore teams\nkept increasing until there was final\nly a total of sixty teams continually\non the road between Helena and\nTonopah. Returns from the plant at\nMillers afforded another sensation,\nfor the report that that rock was\ngiving milling values of over $200\nper ton, nearly all in gold, seemed in\ncredulous. Then came wild reports\nthat it was running over $1000 per\nton. This report was promptly de\nnied by the mine people, and it now\ndivulges that the actual, average\nmilling value of the rock from the\nBroken Hills mine is something over\n$250 per ton. Some of it goes over\n$300, but we prefer to give the low\naverage. Since the ore teams start\ned hauling, 5000 sacks of ore, aver\naging 125 pounds each, or a total of\n312 tons, has" been shipped to the\nmill, and forty tons are now sacked\nand waiting to be hauled to the. rail\nroad. At an average value of $250\nper ton, ore to the value of $87,000\nhas already been milled, while ore\nworth $10,000 is sacked and wait\ning to be shipped. How is that in a\nlittle over a month\'s work?\nWe carefully examined some of\nthe first rock which was shipped,\nsome which is being shipped at pres\nent; the rock on the sides of the\nshaft, and the rock which is being\ntaken from the bottom of the shaft\nat present. It is an identical. It is\na porphyrated quartz, and the gold is\nin the form of chloride of gold, the\nrock shot here and there with silver\nsulphides or carbonates in small.\nbiack patches.\nThe sides, top and bottom of the\nincline shaft, all the way to the ver-\nticle, are formed of this same rock\nNo walls are visible. Where the in\ncline is tapped by the vertical shaft\nquite a cavity has been opened up,\nits roof some eight feet above the\ngeneral slope of the roof of the in\ncline proper. Here a small bit of the\nhanging wall is exposed. The verti\ncal section of the shaft is now down\nforty-five feet, and the sides and bot\ntom are in the chloride rock, no walls\nyet found. The shaft will be contin\ntied straight down, and when the\nfootwall of the ledge is reached\ncrosscutting will be started and con\ntinued to the westerly edge of the\ncompany property, to determine the\nextent of the ledge and to ascertain\nits true and general incline. If the\nledge continues its surface slope, and\nallowing for cutting through it at\nan angle on the vertical shaft, the\nore body now being worked is some\nthirty feet in thickness and the foot\nwall not in sight.\nThe shaft begins near the top of,\nand on the westerly slope, of the hill\nabove mentioned which is but a\nmound, practically. The slope of the\nshaft is to the west, direct, and Is at\nabout a 50 degree angle. It Is to the\nwest, of the Broken Hills mine, or in\nthe direction toward which the big\nledge is inclinng, that the most of\nthe leasers are working, although\nthere are two or three working on\nwhat is now called the back side, or\neast side of the little hill. Further\nover to the northwest several pros\npectors are working, for clear across\nthe district, from Its northwest to\nits southeast corner. Is n line of\nT\'KMiall hills much similar to the one\naround which the town of Helena\ncenters, and to the novice giving the\nimpression of a big ledge which ex\ntends clear across the district. All\nthe workings, with the exception of\none or two above mentioned, are to\nthe west of a line drawn along the\ncrest of this seeming line of hills,\nor along the seeming ledge. Minor\nseams which have been uncovered in\nother parts of the district all have\nthe general trend to the west.\nMANY LEASERS AT WORK.\nSome seventeen leases have been\nlet on the holdings of the Broken\nHills Mining company, and of these\neleven are actually working sinking\nshafts. The Florence Consolidated of\nGoldfield, whose work is being man\naged by G. S. Johnson, has a lease on\nblock 1 and part of block 2 of the\ndistrict, this property being the first\nto the west of the three blocks which\nare held by the Broken Hills com\npany. This company is putting\ndown three shafts. On one of them\nit has installed a big gasoline hoist,\nand the shaft la going down steadily,\nit being down fifty feet at this time.\nThis shaft is due west of the shaft of\nthe Broken Hills concern, in direct\nline with the slope of the ore body\nso far as has been ascertained, and if\nthe same slope continues the shaft is\nbound to cut the ore shoot in the\nnear future. Their second shaft\nfrom which they are taking the rock\nwith a windlass, is due south of this\none, and is down some thirty feet\nwhile a third shaft which they are\nsinking is southeast of this latter\nshaft. Putman and Shea, on block\n11, are sinking a shaft, and at t\ndepth of some thirty feet have en\ncountered stringers of ore. Thomas\nG. Murphy, of Goldfield, has leases\non blocks 26 and 27, and is sinking\non his holdings.\nGould and Meyers are just starting\nwork on their lease on block 25, and\nwill go right down with their shaft\nMining Engineer Lucey has a lease\non block 18, and has a force of men\nsinking a shaft. As yet they are us\ning a hand windlass.\nSmith Brothers, on block 17, In\nline with the latter holding, are down\nfifty feet and still sinking. They\nhave already struck ore, but believe\nit is a new ledge, as they do not con\nsider that they have attained suffi\ncient depth to cut the ledge which\ncrops to the surface at the workings\nof the Broken Hills company.\nBelmont and Dean, of Manhattan,\nhave a lease on block 10, and have\ntheir shaft down sixty feet, and are\nputting it deeper every day. They\nhave carefully prospected their\nground, and gone over the district\ncarefully, and have every belief that\nmany of the leasers working to the\nwest, in particular, of the big strike\nare going to get mines which will\nprove bonanzas.\nDave helms is sinking on block\n14, but he could not be seen and it\nwas not ascertained how far down\nhe has gone.\nThe Prosky lease on block 9 -and\n24 Is not being worked as yet, but we\nare informed that supplies and men\nwill probably be sent out this week\nto commence operations on thi3 prop\nerty. Joe Brecca has a shaft dr"-:i fifty\nfive feet in block 16, on v.\'. irh he\nholds a lease.\nThe Florence Consolidate d U em\nploying the largest force of any of\nthe leasers, and with its power hoist\nwill do rapid work on shaft No. 1.\nThe Broken Hills company is as yet\nusing a whim on one shaft, and a\nwindlass on another. This seeming\nslowness in getting in a power plant\nis due, however, to the fact that Mr.\nMcCormack is to at once build a\nfifty-ton mill on the property, and\nthe power plant and milling and\nhoisting plant will all be installed at\nthe same time. As heretofore stated\nIn these columns, exhaustive tests\nare being made of the-Clifford dis\ntrict ores, so that the mill will be\nable to handle them at the best ad\nvantage." Water is but a compara\ntively short distance away, and with\nin a month pipes will probably be\nlaid to the town, and there will be\nplenty for all uses, milling included.\nIn fact, but a short distance to tne\nsoutheast, \'water can be reached by\nsinking a well but a short distance.\nThere is also an abundance of timber\nwithin six miles of the new town\nAmoVig the business houses at the\ntown of Helena we noticed one res\ntaurant, with another to be opened\nwithin a few days; two grocery and\ngeneral stores, with the Southern Ne\nvada Mercantile company of this city\nerecting a large frame structure in\nwhich they will start a store as soon\nas completed; a bakery, which was\nopened up Monday; a butcher shop,\nwhere all kinds of fresh meat are\nhandled, five saloons which is a\nsmall number for a new mining camp\nof such size and promise; a dance\nhall, and rumors of several more\nbusiness houses which will soon be\nopened.

Meanwhile the shaft is\nbeing carried down will all possible\nspeed.\nThe main shaft of the Consolidated\ncompany is being sunk on the adjoin\ning claim for the same purpose that\nof cutting the Mohawk vein on its\ndip; and as the two shafts are with\nin almost equal distance of the apex\nof the vein, and about 800 feet apart,\nthe importance of the proposition to\nthe entire district is easily under\nstood. One of those interested put it\nto a representative of the Goldfield\nNews in this manner:\n"It is not very often that a mining\nengineer gets a chance to conscient\niously and unqualifiedly advise his\nfriends to put money into prospective\nground, but if the cream of Consoli\ndated ground is not worth mining,\nthen the future of Goldfield is in\ndeed a barren hope. Our calculations\nas to depth, etc., are based upon the\nunderground survey made by Mr.\nLucy for use in the court proceedings\nbetween the Consolidated and the\nJumbo Extension companies in their\nrecent apex litigation. The material\ngathered by him was used in decid\ning the suit. We are therefore not\nguessing; it is simply a business\nproposition, and as such it will, ap\npeal to the people whom we ask to\nput up their money alongside of ours.\nIf the shaft is carried down without\ndelay, we should have ten months\nto mine from the Mohawk vein (en\ntirely disregarding the possibilities\nof the Clermont and Jumbo veins)\nand you know what this will mean in\nthe way of production. There surely\nare sufficient people willing to take a\nchance at the ore body that has made\nGoldfield what she is and on which\nher future must be built."\nThe shaft is now down 150 feet,\nand stringers of quartz are beginning\nto appear, carrying small values.\nLITTLE FLORENCE DUMP.\nA. C. Sisen and associates made a\nten strike when they purchased the\nLittle Florence dump. At present the\nshipments are amounting to about\n100 tons a week. The ore is running\nfrom $18 to $30 a ton. Occasionally\npockets of high grade are found in\nthe dump. Jack Aylesworth is in\ncharge of the conserving operations.\nGOOD ORE PASSED BY.\nThe Huntzinger lease on the Black\nButte played In bad luck or words to\nthat effect. After spending several\nthousands of dollars the leasehold\nwas \'abandoned. Immediately after\nwards an expert was sent into the\nproperty, who found a vein of ore cut\nby the leasers which averages $200\nin gold and silver. A shipment is\nnow being prepared on company ao\ncount. 0\nSTOCK MARKET\nThe following quotations are fur.\nDished by the reliable brokerage flrta\nof Kenneth Donnellan & Co.:\nNEW CAMP 0E\nPIONEER HAS\nA RICH MINE\nClyde R. Ten-ill, owner of the\nBeatty-Bullfrog Miner, of Beatty, is\nin town and reports that the south\nend of the county is progressing fav\norably. He states that at the camp\nof Pioneer, which is about twelve\nmiles from Beatty, there is consider\nable activity. There is one lease\nworking in that camp and they are\nextracting the high grade in large\nquantities and are shipping a car\nload every two days. When the par\nites first started operations on this\nlease the values at the surface as\nsayed about $3 a ton, but after some\ndepth was reached a ledge was en\ncountered that gave amazing returns.\nThe extent of the ledge is not yet\nknown, and the operators are work\ning it on the "glory hole" plan. The\nlease has two years to run and it is\nthought the owners will make a for\ntune out of the property. They\nfreight the ore to Springdale and\ntnere it is loaded on the cars and\nconveyed to the smelters.\nOLD MINE RESUMES.\nThe Rocco Homestake has put on\na force of men again, and they com\nmenced to work Monday, says the\nHamilton correspondent of the Ku\nreka Sentinel.\nIIUENA VISTA MINES.\nT. L. Oddie, who already controls\nthe Brownie mine at Buena Vista, is\nseeking an option at Tiptop, in the\nsame neighborhood. He has secured\nample backing, and the presumption,\nbased on more or less authentic in\nformation is that if the Tip top deal\nis made a consolidation of properties\nwill result, and that one big company\nwill handle them on a large scale.\nNEW MONEY PRODUCED.\nThe output of Rhyolite and vicin\nity for October was: Shoshone, $55,\n000; Keane-Wonder, Funeral range,\n$15,825; Homestake-King, gold bul\nlion, $10,000; Bullfrog-Pioneer, gold\nbullion, $3700; Tramp Consolidated,\ntwenty tons of raw ore, $2000.\nThe . property is owned by several\nSalt Lakers, among whom are C.

Evidently our contem\nporary refers to the letter Hobson Recently addressed to the presi\ndent relative to keeping the battleship fleet now in Oriental seas in\nthe Pacific ocean. Our opinion is that Hobson is too much of an\nalarmist and too impolitic in discussing our relations with foregn na\ntons, especially Japan, but nevertheless his letter to the president was\na clear, logical and accurate presentation of the situation. Naval\nstrength in the Atlantic ocean is no defense for the Pacific coast. If\nthere is any attack to be guarded against it is on these shores. At\nthe suggestion of danger the entire country instinctively looks to\nward the orient. If there is need for protection anywhere it is this\nwestern coast and our insular possessions, all within striking dis-\ntance of Japan. The president has frequently urged the creation of\na strong navy as an arm of national defense. His argument is sound,\nbut ordering the whole strength of the line ships back into the At\nlantic, leaving only a cruiser squadron In these waters, is not in har\nmony with it. The eastern coasts are better fortified than ours,\nhave the advantage of being near the seat of government, the war\ncolleges and the central authority of the army and navy. There is\nno uneasy problem awaiting settlement so far as Europe and Amer\nica are concerned, and all South America could not harm us. Yet\nthe whole scheme of national defense Is centered In the east, where\nall Is secure and there is no rift in the lute, while the Pacific coast\nand the islands over which our flag floats are bereft of ships and left\nto face a possible invasion unprotected and helpless. These are\nfacts which can not be altered by saying Hobson Is intemperate\nand unwise. He is both, but what he stated so clearly to the presi\ndent can not be denied. It is a condition, not a theory, that con\nfronts us, and while Hobson Is probably in error as to tne warlike\nintentions of Japan, it is an unquestioned fact that the Japanese are\na proud people Inflated with success In two wars, and that there ex\nists a cause of friction which may at any time bring\' on a clash of\narms. Will leaving these shores and islands unprotected cause Ja\npan to be any mote complaisant or promote national security in case\nhostilities should occur. Where U the wisdom of keeping nearly\nthirty battleships In the north Atlantic and not a single first-class\none In the whole Pacific ocean.

Bradford and Frank Everett\nreturned Sunday from a trip to the\ncamp of Wagner, where they are\noperating a number of shafts on cop\nper ledges. In speaking of the dis\ntrict and the property visited, Mr.\nBradford said:\n"I am interested in two properties\nthere, the Wagner and the Wagner\nAzurlte. The former is composed of\neighteen claims and the latter six\nteen claims. On the \' Wagner we\nhave a shaft down 412 feet and it is\nwell timbered throughout. This\nshaft will be sunk another 100 feet\nand then a crosscut will be run to the\nnearest vein, which is a contact of\nline and rhyolite and pitches about\n40 degrees to the east. There is\nabout twenty-six feet of ore in the\nshaft, bht is of low grade and runs\nfrom 2 to 8 per cent in copper. In\nsinking this shaft two blind ledges\nfive feet and eighteen feet in width\nwere encountered and both contain\nmore or less copper. There is an\nother shaft on this property which is\ndown eighty-five feet and has passed\nthrough seven feet of shipping rock,\nwhich by sorting will run over 35 per\ncent copper. On three other places\non the surface there is shipping ore\ncropping out of the ground and from\nthese ledges we will commence to\nsend out regular shipments. There\nare two railroads within a mile from\nthe mine, so the shipping facilities\nare excellent.\n"All the vens cut the rhyolite at an\nangle of 40 degrees and finally merge\ninto the lime contact. v Every one\nshows copper and a little gold and\nat depth the sulphides are coming in,\nshowing that the values Increase\nwith depth.\n\'"on the Wagner Azurite property\nthere is a shaft down 242 feet and\nthis is also well timbered and equip\nped with a gasoline hoist. The shaft\nwas started 500 feet from the near\nest cropping and after sinking 136\nfeet through the lava flow the ledge\nwas struck, which was composed of\nquartz and iron. During the sinking\na number of small ledges were found,\nwhich carried gold from $40 to $50 a\nton. Sinking will be continued until\nthe sulphide zone Is reached and\nthen crosscutting will be commenced.\nThe quartz is the hardest in the\nMrs. S.
