This study examines the criteria and properties of the elements \nin the legacy of buildings. Using the Hierarchy Analysis Method (AHP), \nnew instruments are developed based on the criteria and attributes that \nhave been identified for the legacy building elements. The new instrument \nis given to industry professionals and academicians to get their opinions. \nThis study shows the number of attributes of the score for the criteria. The \nresults show that new instruments are developed and used as tools for \nassessing the elements of heritage building conditions. This new \ninstrument can be proposed to the National Heritage Department to be used \nas a guideline for assessing the heritage buildings in the future. \n1 Introduction  \nIn the effort to extend the life of the heritage buildings in the country through the \nconservation of buildings, there is a tendency for the government to take over the building \nto be a memorial [1]. However, it raises the question of whether there are any guidelines on \nthe assessment of the situation of heritage buildings in Malaysia's national memorial in \nmaintaining heritage buildings as exhibition space related to the history of their leadership \n[2]. According to the case study and the literature review has found that there are heritage \nbuildings are dilapidated, lost the characteristics of originality in design, architecture and \nbuilding materials caused no heritage management and poorly maintained and modified on \na scale that allows [1]. Such situations will indirectly accelerate the process of building \ndamage occurring in a heritage building as well as destroying the original identity [2]. \nThere are also some heritage buildings left without owners being known and left empty and \nunattended [2]. The weaknesses in managing the maintenance of heritage buildings have \ncaused serious damage to building structures and fabrics [3]. The effects of these \nweaknesses have led to unsafe buildings to be occupied and the potential to be demolished \nas happened to the Bok House in Kuala Lumpur [1-2]. \nThere is no standard for assessing the state of heritage buildings, various methods \nhave been used in assessing [3]. Each method has different criteria. Each criterion will have \nanother important stage. Considering the various methods of examination related to state \n                                        \n* Corresponding author: timi_gee@yahoo.com \nÂ© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Referring to the results of \nthe study on the inventory of Malaysian heritage buildings carried out by the National \nMuseum in 1992, it is estimated that about 35,000 pre-war buildings in 265 cities studied \naround the country should be preserved [2]. However, most of these heritage buildings are \nnot well-preserved and most of them are in bad condition due to building damage factors \n[3]. It is even more unfortunate that these heritage buildings are being threatened with \ndestruction as neglected by the original owners to be demolished on the demands of \ndevelopment as well as lack of community concerns in order to conserve heritage buildings \n[2-3]. However, it raises the question of whether there are any guidelines for assessing the \ncondition of heritage buildings in Malaysia in maintaining heritage buildings as historical \nexhibition halls [3]. There are no guidelines creates a dispute on how to implement the \nprocess accordingly. \nAssessment of the condition is an important aspect of effective maintenance planning \n[4]. Many studies have highlighted the factors that influence the quality of maintenance [3]. \nHowever, the number of researches focused on the evaluation of the very limited heritage \nof buildings [2-3]. The purpose of the assessment is to assess the state of the physical \nelements and building services and to assess the maintenance facilities requirements. The \nstate assessment as a check and observation work on the outside and inside of the building, \nincluding the foundation, structure and mechanical system to identify the presence of any \ndamage to the building and its components [5]. Meanwhile, the assessment of the situation \nis part of the investigation work on the construction and facilities of existing property with \nsufficient information to enable the value to advise on various problems that occur in the \nbuilding [6]. Therefore, the organization of building and maintenance must have in-depth \nknowledge monitor their building conditions to prevent those defects and building failures. \nInefficiencies building maintenance work systems may cause defects and damage to \nbuildings [3].  \nAssessment of heritage building conditions is important as most of these buildings \nhave been in existence for hundreds of years and have suffered much damage [7]. To \nensure that the heritage buildings are safe and always in good condition, appropriate \nperiodic inspections should be carried out to identify the current situation and to provide \nremedial action [5-6]. Thus, failure to check can contribute to the future failure of existing \nassets [8]. This study aims to develop a new instrument for assessing the state of the \nelements specific to the heritage buildings.

Flow Chart of Process \n \nThe hierarchical structure in this study is the selection of elements of heritage building \nto the performance of building condition. Firstly, the goals need to set, the second is to \ndetermine the criteria and attributes of that goal. This study is choosing heritage building \nelements, the criteria include building a structure, building fabric, and building service. \nLastly, the third level extracts from literature review and visual site survey to be selected in \nthe set of attributes. The attribute includes foundation, column, beam, truss, stair, ceiling, \nfloors, roof, windows, doors, internal and external walls, arch, electric, air condition, fire \nprotection and sanitary. This all elements are important in the component of the heritage \nbuilding.  \nTable 1.

In this case study, the highest priority was given to building structures \nwith 0.481, building fabric with 0.405 and building services with 0.114 of their respective \ninfluence (Table 7).  \nThe table also shows attribute ranking is changed when the importance of foundation \nover to all attribute in building a structure. Foundation has the highest priority with 0.458 \nrespect to the building structure. While the other attribute show, a column with 0.221, beam \nwith 0.207, truss with 0.076 and the lowest is stair with 0.039. The ranking of attributes is \nas follows: foundation, column, beam, truss, and stair.

The figure shows how attribute ranking is changed when the \nimportance of the floor over to all attribute in building fabric. The ranking of attributes is as \nfollows: Floor, interior wall, external wall, roof, ceiling, door, window, and arch. \nOther than that, building service is described qualitatively, by words. The \ncomparisons of the building service with respect to the criteria and attribute. It can be seen \nthat electric have the highest priority of 0.525. The medium priorities are air condition with \n0.279 and fire protection with 0.139 and the lowest is sanitary with 0.057. The attribute \nranking is changed when the importance of electric over to all attribute in building service. \nThe ranking of attributes is as follows: electric, air condition, fire protection and sanitary. \nAll criteria and attribute is influence from each of them. The consistency ratio (CR) \nindicates an acceptable level of inconsistency. \nThe finding of this study shows the number of attributes of the score for the criteria. \nFor building structure criteria the number of attributes of the score is 2.280, while the \nbuilding fabric criteria of the total attribute of the score are 1.456 and the last criteria for \nservice building the total attribute score is 0.444. In conclusion, Scenario A has an overall \nscore of 4.180, this shows that the condition of the building in good condition. Therefore, \nbased on Table 6 the scale of action and the type of maintenance, Scenario A has achieved \npriority 4 and the scale of action is routine. The action scale for Scenario A needs to be \ndone as scheduled maintenance action requirements such as monitoring, repair, replacement \nto prevent serious defects or damage. \n \n \n \n7\nE3S Web of Conferences 65, 01007 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20186501007\nICCEE 2018\n', '5 Conclusion \nA building condition assessment model was generated using the method of AHP.
