Christmas is not one of the\nmoveable feasts of the church "\n"What I mean," explained the\ntraveler, \'\'is that if you had Christ\nmas here under the same conditions\nyou would have it in July, I had my\nlast Christmas dinner in Australia."\nIn reply to various inquiries he ex\nplained:\n"As ynu, tif course, know, they have\nsummer in Austral in when we have\nwinter here, but what struck me as\nNtrantre was that, jlihoiii:h Christmas\nis the most adaptable feast in the\nworld the people tif Australia cele\nIn ate it just as we do. Lust Cristmas\nIn Coolgardic there was a sandstorm\ninstead of it blizzard, and the ther\nmometer stood 90 degrees in the shade,\nbut the windows of the stores were\ndressed with cotton snow and tinsel\nice and evert; reens, just as If the festi\nval were be inn held in England, where\nmost of those who were pari Icipatlng\nhad been horn. On Christmas eve\nSanta Claus came with a jinnlc of\nleiirhhells and stamped around to\nshake off the artificial snow and al\nmost suffocated with mufflers and\nrobes. TImj Chritmas dinner was just\nas heavy as ever was served in mid\nwinter, and the plum puddings, that\nhad been sent out from England by\nthoughtful friends, wero brought on\nburning."\nThis led to a discussion of Christ\nmas as it Is celebrated In different\nparts of the world, and the fact was\nbrought out that though Christmas\nrevels often admit of variations the\nAnifln-Saxons, not usinn the term In\nthe all embracing sense described by\nMr, Dooley, have a tendency to cele\nbrate it in t he same manner wherever\nthey may be. Different arctic explorers\nhave given accounts of Imw they cele\nbrated Christmas within the arctic\ncircle, und the whole energy was di\nrected toward making the event as\nclose a duplicate of similar celebra\ntions at home as fresh seal meat and\ncanned goods would allow.\n"1 noticed," said the clergyman,\nthat where\'er Christmas is introduc\ned among heathen people by our mis\nsionaries when the festival is celebrat\ned they always regard it as supplant\ning some of their barbaric feasts and\nwive it some of the characteristics of\nwhat they havegiven up for it. 1 spent\none Christmas at a mission station\namonK the Indians of the northwest,\nand when they gathered around their\nChristmas tree they sung the hymns\nthey had been taught and besides\nchanted weird, monotonous songs of a\nmaddening rhyi hem that mudn me feer\nthat the festival would degenerate in\nto a ghost dance or something of the\nsort."\n"That sort of thing was what I re\nferred .o," said the traveler, "when I\nspoke of Christmas as being an adapt\nable feast. It seems to change in char\nacter to suit theilefferent nations that\ncelebruf it. and as we havo it now it\nhas gathered features from many sour\'\nces. Its liveliness, while being a rellgl\nuus Institution, Is attributed to the\nfuel that It supplanted the old saturn\nalls of pagan Rome tnd took some\nthing of the same character, as may\nbe seen from the fact that in early\ntimes the festivities were always pre\nsided over by a lord of misrule. Then\nthe tree lighted with candles was ad\nded to it when it was introduced by\nthe church among the Scandinavians,\nwho used to burn candles before the\ntree Ygdrrasil, or tree of life, and in\ngiving up their mythology for Chris\ntianity they si ill retained the symbol,\nwhich is now regarded as nothing\nmore than a convenient thiiui.XuJung\ntoys and presents on."\n"Hut." exclaimed the Impecunious\none who kept his mind on the mate\nrial side of things, "whatever the\nchurch or ancient mythologies did for\nChristmas. America did the most of\nall to make it a satisfying institu\ntion "\n"I don\'t sec how," salil the clergy\nman. "It was celebrated long beft.re\nthe\'discovery of America."\n"Quite true," replied the loyal\nAmerican. "Hut America had to be\ndiscovered before the turkey could be\nmarie tlie crowning glory of Christmas.\nChristopher Columbus discovered it\nthe moment he landed, and, by the\nway, it is a remarkable fact that less\nthan 30 years after the discovery of\nthe new world the turkey Is mention\ned in old descriptions of Christmas\nfestivities as being the chief part of\nthe Christmas cheer."\n"That reminds me," said the clergy\nman, "that America, with its rapid\nmethods, has effected another change\nIn the Christmas festivities. Origi\nnally they lasted from Christines day\nuntil Twelfth Night, but wo have\nsuch a habit of condensing tilings\nthat the wh.ile fortnight of revels has\nbeen boiled down to one night and otic\nday."\n"Oh, well," said the American\ncheerily, "I think 1 have learned all I\nwant to ahoutChrittnas. I have learn\ned that it originated as a religious\nrite, then became a festival, later a\nrevel, and now It is just a yearly blow\nout that makes a fellow like me hustle\nfor the price of the necessary presents\nand remembrances."\nMISSISSIPPI TOWNS.\nThe Population of the Leading Ones\nof the State.\nWashington, Dec. 9.

C, Ethiopian, a\npaper published by colored men in the\nInterest of the negro race, in a recent\nIssue says: "Tho greatest blow the\nnegro has ever received, and the one\nfrom whose damaging effects he will\nnever recover, was given him by con\ngressional enactments. It was the un\nconditional Imposition of the right of\nfranchise, for which he was In no way\nqualified. No government has ever\ndone a defenceless people a greater in\njury. We do not consider that those\nStates that have passed amendments\nto their constitutions abridging the\nprivilege of some of the citizens In the\nexercise of franchise, have done the\nnegro half so great an evil us was done\nhim by the national government when\nIt Imposed this right upon him." Ut\nterances liko this one are becoming\ncommon uniting the thoughtful leadors\nof the negro race In tho South, and\nthe attention of Northern extremists\nIs invited to them.\nSnys tho Hademan Free Press: We\ntrust that our delinquent subscribers\nwill send us a squirrel or possum tor\nChristmas, because on that\' day we\nfeel a little fastidious.

TOWER FURNISHES INFORMA\nTION TO MAJOR HENRY.\nClarion-Lodger.\nThe Mississippi members of (Nan\ncress are manifesting considerable In\nterest in the Crumpaeker bill which\npropose to cut down Southern repre\nsentation. A day or so ago the Secre\ntary of State received a letter from\nCongressman nenry, of this district,\nasking for some statistics as to regis\ntration aod amount expended for edu\ncation in Mississippi.\nIn response the Secretary of State\ngives the registration of the State in\n1896, with the exception of twenty\ncounties that failed to report, at 125,\n571, of which 109,337 was white and\n10,234 colored. He estimates the\nregistered vote in 1899 at 137,500, of\nwhich 120.000 was white and 17,500\nwas colored. The vote cast at a gen\neral election by no means indicates\nthe general vote of the State, as the\nprimaries practically determine the\nelect ion, and in the primary election\nof 1809 the vote cast for United States\nSenator in 52 counties was 60.759.\nEstimating the other counties from\nan average of this vote the total vote\nin the 75 counties would have been\n96,291. The primary vote is not offi\ncially reported to the Secretary of\nState, butshould he in the selection of\nState officers and Congressmen.\nThe Mississippi Legislature at its\nlast session appropriated one million\ndollars for the common schools and\n$272,535 for colleges.white and colored,\nmaking a total of 41,272,534, and a\nlike sum for the year 1901. The school\nfund Is distributed pro rata, regard\nless of race, and the colored cducable\npopulation being about 100,000 more\nthan the white, tho colored people of\ncourse get the largest share of the\nschool fund, and at the same time are\ntho principal delinquents in poll tax\npayments.

It\nhas happened in . olhr Northern\nStates as it has tow happeiifj)\'1n Colo\nrado. There is no race question in\nthe North or in tho West, as there is\nin the South, yet there are no confines -to\nthe spirit, risen in recent years,\nthat in extreme cases puts the negro\noutside the protection of the law."\nThe "crime of killing without law\nand by general consent" was far more\ncommon in Indiana, and other States\nof its group, than in the South before\nthe transformation and demoraliza\ntion of war, emancipation and recon\nstruction. As to these "extreme no-"\ngro cases," to discourse upon them as\n"originating In the South" is not ,\nstrictly consistent with a fact of his\ntory. It may sound strangely, but it\nis none the less truth of record, that\nnegro lynching\' "originated" in Colo\nrado There Is a certain volume of\nthe reports of theethuologicul hureau,\nin which the tragic fate of the first\nnegro that ever sot, foot on American\nsoil is related. He was a servant of the\ncelebrated Spanish explorer, Corona-\ndo, who penetrated the American in\nterior as far as Nebraska, at the same\nperiod of Hernando Do Soto\'s discov\nery of the Mississippi; near Ave huri- .\ndred years ago. In Colorado Coronado\nfound a tribe of highly civilized In\ndians, with whom lie tarried on the \'\'\nfriendliest terms. lie was watted on\none day by a delegation of the Indians ;\nPueblos or Moquis, probably and\ninformed that his black man had been .\nexecuted by them; lynched we would .,\'\ncall It. Significantly Indeed, he had\ncommitted the same crime for which\nthe negrj was burned in Colorado the\nother day. In his stately Spanish\nstyle Coronado dismissed his callers,\'\ntelling them that they had serve the\nnegro right.\nThe first case of negro lynching of\nwhich we ever heard it was unknown,\nas was the exceptional crime in slave\ndays was visited upon a negro soldier\nby the Federal officers of the Ship Is\nland garrison; shortly after the close\nof the war. The negro bad assaulted\nthe daughter of the Federal general\nn command of that post, whose name ,\nwill occur to our readers who recall\nthe circumstance. If the "spirit" has\nrisen in recent years, it Is because the\noffense avenged Is of recent growth.\nIn it is to be found a symptom of re\nversion to bestial itis of the aboriginal ,\nAfrican, which the repression of slav\nery but glossed over In the lower\ntypes of the race.

Our contemporary, the Jack\nson Evening News submitted an edi\ntorial a few days since, which we,\nwith pleasure, transfer to our columns\nof this Issue, and bespeak fur it a care\nful perusal by our readers.\nIf country roads cannot be pulled\njoin of the old legislative ruts, we can\nat least, extend encouragement to the\nefficiency and success of railroads, for\nupon these eyery other business en\nterprise depends. One important\ntruth is now univerally realized, that\nis, n Stale without sutlicient railroad\nfacilities is liable to be last out of the\nprocession. The News says:\n"The News has observed the general\ndesire expressed by its esteemed con\ntemporaries of the State for good\ncountry roads, as a movement that\ndeserves encouragement, Hnd commen\ndation. It must be understood, however,\nthat It is a proposed inprovement\nt tin t will require time, radical changes\nof existing laws, and indeed an entire\nnew scheme.\nIt is difficult to repeal old statutes\nii h wliicli the people are familiar,\nand adopt new, especially If the\nchunue requires a large outlay of\nmoney. We concur in the move, hut\nit will necessarily drag its way slowly\nfor some time to come.\nThe News would urge earnest efforts\nand encouragement to the building of\nthe several lines or projeted railroads,\nso touch needed in the counties\nthrough which 1 1 icy would run. Mime\nnf these lines have been surveyed and\nothers will he in the near future. The\npromoters of t he road from this city\nto (jol\'Jinuus, have met and organized\nand are hopeful of success. The smart\nand live little city of West Point that\nalways accomplishes what It under\ntakes, proposes a line from that city\nto Oxford, and perhaps a more distant\nterminus.\nThe city of Water Valley is solicit\nous for the bunding of a railroad from\nI lure to .Memphis or some oilier favor-tni\'-\npoint. The contemplated road\nI mm i In! city of Natchez through\n1\' r.mkliu and adjacent counties is re\nreiving substantial eueouragenient\nIroin the neotjle along its line.\nThe enterprising city of Vicksburg\nlias indicated that a road should and\nmust be liuilt from that Important\n(listniiutlng point through Madisoi\nL\'-akv, Winston and other counties to\nMacon in Noxubee, or other suitable\nterminus. So the outlook Is for more\nrailways and additional facilities for\ntravel, transportation of freight, etc.\nFor these objects we are at all times\nready to render any aid in our power,\nout in soliciting this great outlay ol\ncapital, most of which must come\nfrom elsewhere, public sentiment\nshould correct, evils that liavecrept in\nlo experimental litigation ag.iinsi\nrailroads that are being operated. In\nsuits, often without merit, juries arc\nsought to be influenced by arousing\ntheir prejudices against corporations.\nAs heietof;re stated by the News\nnegroes, and not unfrequently lazy\nIdlers, who in all respects are non pro\nducers, appear as litigants against\nrailroads, under a contract witli some\nlawyer to divide what ever may be re\ncovered. The people, property owners\nand tax pavers, which last includes\nrailroads, should shift and expose tins\nlo \'.v iliii-e of i lunation.\nTrial causes in court on the share\nplan consumes time, pay of officers.\njuries, witnesses, etc., all of which is\nto be pain by the tax payers.\nThese experimental share contracts\nnever provide for payment of costs if\npiaintiir loses, this important pro\ntection to those who hear the burdens\nof tfovenimenl, is supplied by theoaih\nol the irresponsible plaiutiif, I hat he\nis without means to pay costs or give\nsecurity for its pa merit. It, is said\nthat tills character id\' litigation has\ngrown lo huge proportions in some\ncounties. It is also stated that such\nexperimental suits, often without\nmerits, where the liability is charged\nto have occurred in one county, is in\nstituted in some other and distant\ncounty, where it is understood large\nveraicts are given.\nOur information is that occasional\ncauses originating in the State of\nLouisiana against railroads, for per\nsonal injuries, wrongs complained of,\nare brought in the courts of Missis\nsippi. This diameter of litigation\ndeserves to he resented by tax payers.\nUndoubtedly a litigant should be \'will\ning to submit his case to the people of\nIns own State.\nThese references are made because\nthere is some prosperity in the country\nand as General Gordon said i\'l bis\nspcecli at the Industrial Convention\nin INew Orleans, "Georgia is In line."\nWe want Mississippi "in line" and\nbelieve that the people of the State\nwaut better dirt roads, railroads,\nmore factories, and oilier business en\nterprises and will see to it that capi\ntal can oo saieiy invested and will re\nceive fair treatment in our State."\nThat Poll Tax.\nThe following from Ed.
