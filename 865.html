        <pre>['614 AGRONOMY JOURNAL \nFORAGE CROPS, Second Edition \nBy Gilbert H .  Ahlgren. N e w  York .  McGraw-Hill Book Co. \n53G p p .  1956. $7.00. \nThi:; book presents in a systematic manner the facts and funda- \nmentals associated with the forage production. Individual treatment \nof the most important legumes and grasses introduces the reader \nto the characteristics and adaptations associated with each. Fol- \nlowing the detailed species study, the latter part of the book is \ndevoted to grass-legume mixtures, soil treatments, seedbed prepara- \ntions, making hay and silage, and other subjects that are common \nto all the forage crops. \nIn this second edition, the material has all been reorganized for \ngreater clarity and integration, and recent research findings have \nbeen incorporated and tabular data reduced. Chapters have been \nadded on pasture and range management, as well as new material \non hay, silage, pasture, and seed production. \nAdded emphasis is given to the dryland grasses, pasture man- \nagement, mineral nutrition, fertilizer treatment, and weed control. \nForuge crops will prove of great value not only in the classroom \nbut as a reference on the subject for county agricultural agents, \nvocational agricultural teachers, soil conservationists, professional \nagricul turd workers, and members of seed associations, fertilizer \ngroups, and livestock associations. \nTHE WHEAT INDUSTRY IN AUSTRALIA \nBy A. R.  Ca!laghan and A. J. Millington. Sydney, Australia, Angus \nand Robertson. 486 p p .  1956. Fc/-(Aust.) $7.00. (U. S.). \nThe accomplishments of one’s counterparts abroad are always of \ngreat interest to workers in all professions. This has been particu- \nlarly true of ’  agriculture, especially during the past decade when \ncommunication and cooperation among the agricultural workers \nthroughout the world have been greatly expanded. This book deals \nwith the history and present status of the wheat industry in \nAustralia. It is the first such comprehensive study. This is a \nthorough presentation, covering such aspects of the topic as rain- \nfall clnaracteristics of the Australian Wheat Belt, soil structure \nand fertility problems (to which four chapters are devoted), \nbreeding (including selection for varietal improvement), disease \ncontrol, tillage and seeding problems, harvesting methods, markets, \nagricultural economics, and a most interesting discussion on the \nsubject, “The farmer and his technical advisers.” \nThe introduction presents a detailed discussion of agricultural \nhistory in England, and the first chapter outlines the history of \nfarmirig in Australia from the days of the original penal colonies \nthrough the recent war. \nMr. Calaghan and Mr. Millington are two of the foremost wheat \nauthorities in Australia. Their study should be of broad general \ninterest to American readers. The book is not in the nature of \n“Advances” or “Reviews”, and therefore does not record any \nnew specific research findings from Australia. It is profusely illus- \ntrated and very well organized and written. Copie:, are not avail- \nable in the United States, but can be procured from the publishers, \nAngus & Robertson Ltd., 89-95 Castlereagh St., Sydney, N.S.W., \nAustralia. \nFORESTRY IN THE SOUTH \nBy M .  D. Mobley and R. N .  Hoskins. Atlanta. Turner E. Smith \nt~ Co. 440 p p .  $3.95. (Schools, $2.96). 1956. \nThe part that forestry plays in the economy of the South, and \nthe many practical problems of the industry are set forth in this \ncompact, non-technical text book. This is intended as a textbook \nfor elementary and secondary schools of the South, and seems \nespecially well suited for the vocational agriculture teacher. \nTopics covered in the book are the paper industry, definitions \nof forestry terms, how to estimate standing timber, restocking of \nforests, importance of wildlife to forestry, what forests mean to \nthe soil, forest insects and diseases, production c’f naval stores, \npulpwood production, growing tree seedlings, and fire prevention. \nThe general reader will find much of great interest in this easy- \nto-read book. It has numerous good quality illustrations. \nELEMENTS O F  GENETICS, Third Edition \nBy Edward C. Colin. N e w  Yo&, McGraw-Hill Book Co.. Inc. \n489 p p .  19SG. $5.7S. \nSeveral major revisions are incorporated in this edition of Dr.  \nthe author’s historical approach which shows i:he reader the \nlogical development of the science of genetics since Mendel con- \nducted the experiments which were the basis of modern genetic \nprinciples. Extensive revisions have been made in the chapters on \nfactor principle, linkage and crossing over, the gene and mutation, \nhuman heredity, and heredity and evolution. A separate chapter \nis devoted to the topic of multiple alleles. And there are also \ntwo new separate chapters on domesticated plants and animals. \nThe student Gill find new material also on blood groups, chemi- \ncal induction of mutation, physiological genetics, and genetics \nand evolution. The beginning student should find inspiration in \nthe opening biographical chapter on Mendel. \nAs a basic text, it covers the fundamental aspects of the science \nand introduces the student to its practical developments in plant \nlife, animals, and man. \nAgronomic Affdirs \nN E W  OFFICERS \nFollowinn are duly \nANNOUNCED AT CINCINNATI \nelected officers of the various Societies and \ndivisions w%o assumed office at the annual meetings in Cincinnati, \nOhio, Nov. 15, 1956. \nAMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nPRESIDENT \nVICE PRESIDENT \nA.
