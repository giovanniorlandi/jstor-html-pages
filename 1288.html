A brief review of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is presented. The present work touches on \na few technical aspects and recent developments of AMS, and describes two specific applications of AMS, the \ndating of human DNA with the 14C bomb peak and the search for superheavy elements in nature. Since two \nextended general reviews on technical developments in AMS [1] and applications of AMS [2] will appear in \n2013, frequent reference to these reviews is made.\n1 Introduction \nDirect atom counting with Accelerator Mass \nSpectrometry (AMS) revolutionized the utilization of \nlong-lived radionuclides, which previously had to be \ndetected through their feeble radioactive decay. This \nbrought about a reduction in sample size by factors of \nthousand to a million (gram to milligram to microgram), \nopening up many new applications.  \nWith AMS one usually measures atom ratios of \nthe rare radionuclide to a stable nuclide in the range from \n10-12 to 10-16 with mass spectrometric techniques \nincluding an accelerator. It turned out that tandem \naccelerators have many advantages for such \nmeasurements, and consequently almost all AMS \nfacilities around the world (~100) are based on this type \nof accelerator (Fig. 1, [1]). Although 14C comprise about \n90% of all AMS measurements, more than 50 different \nradionuclides across the nuclear chart – both natural and \nman-made - are by now being utilized by AMS. This led \nto a wide variety of AMS applications in almost every \ndomain of our environment at large [2].    \nIn the current work a brief general description of \nAMS will be given, covering both recent technical \ndevelopments and applications in the many fields AMS \nhas made an impact. Two special applications will be \ntreated in more detail. The use of the 14C bomb peak to \ndetermine the age of human cells by dating DNA \nextracted from them, and the search for superheavy \nnuclides in nature. \n2 Technical Advances of AMS \nIn order to measure the ultra-low radionuclide \nabundances mentioned above, AMS has to efficiently \nremove interferences from both  molecular and atomic \nisobars of stable nuclides. Without accelerators, this is \nsometimes impossible and hence these isobars limit \nstandard mass spectrometric methods.  \nThe use of tandem accelerators requires the use \nof negative ions from the ion source, which has a distinct \nadvantage for the detection of some radionuclides \nbecause the corresponding stable atomic isobars (in \nbrackets) cannot form negative ions: 3H (3He), 14C (14N), \n26Al (26Mg), 36Cl (36Ar), 55Fe (55Mn), 68Ge (68Zn), 129I \n(129Xe), 202Pb (202Hg). However molecular  isobars with \nstable nuclides usually form negative ions, e.g. 12CH2- \nand 13CH-, and therefore must be removed by other \nmeans. For AMS with tandem accelerators this is usually \naccomplished by the stripping process in the terminal. On \nthe other hand, some radionuclides form negative \nmolecular ions while the corresponding molecule with \nthe stable isobar (in brackets) does not, e.g. \n41CaH3(41KH3). The more difficult cases for AMS are \nradionuclides where  negative ions exist for stable atomic \nand  molecular isobars (in brackets), e.g. 10BeO (10BO), \n36Cl (36S), 53MnO (53CrO), 60Fe (60Ni). When the \nradionuclide of interest does not form negative atomic or \nmolecular ions, e.g. 39Ar and 81Kr,  positive-ion \naccelerators have to be used, and strong interference from \nthe stable isobars 39K and 81Br, respectively,  have to be \ndealt with. If the isobar interference cannot be removed \nby selective ion formation or filtering, the final separation \nhas to happen after the accelerator. For this, higher \nenergy is always an advantage and thus favors larger \ntandem accelerators. \n2.1 Small and large AMS facilities \nThe most significant technical development of AMS in \nrecent years is the trend to ever smaller AMS facilities, \nparticularly for 14C measurements. This is depicted in \nFigure 1 reproduced from the recent review by Synal [1]. \nTogether with the reduction of carbon sample sizes from \n \n \n           \n \xa0DOI: 10.1051/\nC© Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2013\n,\n/\n03001 2013)\n36303001201\n63\nepjconf\nEPJ Web of Conferences\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License 2.0, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, \nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. \n(\nArticle available at http://www.epj-conferences.org or http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/20136303001\n', ' \n \n  \n \nFigure 1. The growth of the number of tandem AMS facilities since 1978, as shown in Figure 4 of Ref. [1]. The different grey \nshades of the column sections indicate the tandem terminal voltages in MV (see last column in 2012). Cyclotrons (bottom sections) \nwere only in use until 2008. The increase in the number of small tandem AMS facilities in the later years is clearly visible. \n \n \nFigure 2. Layout of the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA). This dedicated AMS facility if based on a 3-MV \nPelletron tandem accelerator. The detection of 14C is schematically indicated. Since its first operation in 1996, the facility was \nupgraded twice to allow AMS experiments for ‘all’ isotopes. A third upgrade is planned with a laser – negative ion interaction at the \ninjection side, and an additional 90-degree analyzing magnet in the detector area. \n \n03001-p.2\nEPJ Web of Conferences\n', ' \nmilligram to microgram (e.g. [3]), this may be called the \nsecond revolution of radiocarbon dating (the first was \natom counting versus decay counting). Small AMS \nfacilities such as the mini radiocarbon dating system \nMICADAS in Zurich [4] occupy a floor space of less \nthan 10 m2, which is comparable to the space requirement \nfor a standard mass spectrometer. By contrast, the largest \nAMS facilities such as the one based on a 14-MV tandem \naccelerator in Munich occupy a hundred times larger \nfloor space  [5]. However, the much higher energies \navailable at this facility allows one to perform isobar \nseparation for  AMS experiments not possible at the \nsmaller machines. Examples are 53Mn [6], 60Fe [7], and \n63Ni [8]. Somewhat in between the small and large \nmachines  is the Vienna Environmental Research \nAccelerator (VERA), a dedicated  AMS facility based on \na 3-MV tandem accelerator [9]. A schematic of the \nupgraded VERA facility is shown in Figure 2. Although a \nconsiderably larger floor space  than MICADAS is \nneeded, VERA has the advantage to allow one to perform \nAMS experiments for the entire mass range of nuclides \n[10], from hydrogen to superheavy elements. It should be \nnoted, though, that in the mass region of actinides there \nexist no stable atomic isobars and therefore small AMS \nfacilities can also be used for their detection [11]. \nHowever, molecular isobar interferences limit the \nsensitivity to some extent [12]. \n2.2 New developments of isobar suppression \nTwo different approaches to suppress stable isobars of \ninterfering negative ions at low energy are under \ndevelopment [13, 14]. When the interfering atomic or \nmolecular anions have an electron affinity lower than the \nnegative ion of the radionuclide of interest, it is possible \nto selectively neutralize the former by photodetachment  \nwith a laser, and therefore remove it from the negative \nion beam [15]. In order to do this efficiently, the ions \nextracted from a Cs-beam sputter source with typically 20 \nkeV have to be slowed down to thermal energies in a \nlinear quadrupole guide by buffer-gas-cooling [16]. \nCurrently, such a system is in the test phase at the VERA \nlab, and will soon be put online with the AMS facility. \nThis should allow one to utilize also “difficult” \nradionuclides at the relatively low energies of the VERA \nfacility.  \n The other method was pioneered at the IsoTrace \nlaboratory in Toronto [14], and  uses isobar specific ionic \nreactions in a gas-filled radiofrequeny quadrupole (RFQ) \nreaction cell at eV energies. This method looks promising \nto perform selective on-line ion chemistry with large \nsuppression of unwanted stable isobars [17]. It will \neventually also allow one to use small AMS facility \nwhere the isobar interferences must be removed at the \ninjection side of the tandem accelerator. \n3 Applications of  AMS \nThe broad range of applications of AMS have recently \nbeen reviewed for the special volume “100 Years of Mass \nSpectrometry” [2]. Here we reproduce the table from this \nreview which allows one to get an impression of the \nmultitude of application in the seven domains of our \nenvironment at large. The table clearly indicates the \nimportance of 14C measurements in almost every field of \napplication. A detailed discussion of the various \napplications indicated in the table can be found in ref. [2]. \nHere only two  recent applications of AMS in different  \nfields (biomedicine and astrophysics) will be discussed: \n14C bomb peak dating of human DNA and the search for \nsuperheavy elements in nature, respectively. \n \nTable 1.

At this time the limited nuclear \ntest ban treaty put a halt to the testing, and in the ensuing \n50 years the atmospheric 14C dropped back to almost \nnormal through the exchange of 14CO2 with the biosphere  \nand the ocean  [20]. This rapidly varying 14C excess \neffectively labeled every living species on Earth \nincluding humans, and allows dating with a resolution of \none to two years. (It should be noted that for 14C bomb \npeak dating the radioactive decay of 14C is negligible, see \nFig. 4b). \n \nFigure 3. Picture of the first US test of a hydrogen bomb at the Marshall islands in 1952. This signaled the beginning of large \nabove-ground nuclear weapon testing which lasted until 1963, when the nuclear test ban treaty (NTBT) stopped these activities. The \nneutron flux from the nuclear explosions produced the excess of 14C depicted in Figure 4. \n \n \nFigure 4.

The 14C content measured in different cells (red dots) can be interpreted as the average time  \n         elapsed after birth (vertical line) to form the particular cell population. The results are shown for individuals born after  \n         the NTBT (A, B) and before it (C, D). \n          \n   Figure 6. Results of 14C bomb peak dating of the human olfactory bulb [21]. Vertical lines indicate the birth date of   \n    individuals investigated. The upper panel shows the results for non-neuronal cells (a, b), and the lower one for neurons \n   (c, d). The latter one indicate very little if any neurogenesis after birth. \n \n 03001-p.5\nHeavy Ion Accelerator Symposium 2013\n', ' \nThe basic principle to deduce the birth date of  cells \nin humans is quoted here from Spalding et al. [18]: “Most \nmolecules in a cell are in constant flux, with the unique \nexception of genomic DNA, which is not exchanged after \na cell has gone through its last division. The level of 14C \nintegrated into genomic DNA should thus reflect the level \nin the atmosphere at any given point, and we \nhypothesized that determination of 14C levels in genomic \nDNA could be used to retrospectively establish the birth \ndate of cells in the human body.” Figure 5 is reproduced \nfrom this seminal work and demonstrates the power of \nthe method. \nIn a collaboration between the VERA lab in Vienna \nand the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm the olfactory \nbulb system in humans was investigated [21]. Here only a \nfew microgram of DNA were available for the 14C AMS \nmeasurements, demanding a particular careful sample \npreparation in every step from the human tissue to the \nfinal carbon sample [3]. Figure 6 shows that very little if \nany new neurons were formed in the human olfactory \nbulb after birth [21], in stark contrast to rodents where \n50% turnover in adulthood has been observed. \nHowever, in the most recent work of Spalding et al. \n[22]  neurogenesis throughout adulthood was found in the \nhuman hippocampus, adding to the plasticity of this \nimportant part of the brain (Fig. 7). \nFigure 7. Results of 14C bomb peak dating of the human \nhippocampus [22]. The Δ14C values (red dots) for  64 \nindividuals are plotted at their respective birth dates. Values \nabove the curve before the rise of the 14C excess, and below the \ncurve after the peak therefore indicate neurogenesis after birth. \n3.2. Search for superheavy elements in nature \nIn 1969 Glenn Seaborg schematically extended the \nperiodic table beyond element 103 (Lawrencium), which \nwas the heaviest known element at that time [23].  In the \nensuing 40 years, elements 104 to 118 were synthesized  \n \nFigure 8. The periodic table of the elements based on the schematic extension beyond element 103 proposed in 1969 [23]. The \nyellow-framed elements (104 through 118) have since been produced in heavy ion reactions. None of the uncolored elements \nhave yet been observed. The search for superheavy nuclides was performed with natural materials assuming that the SHE \nhomologues, indicated by the red frames, will follow their respective host material (see text). \n \n03001-p.6\nEPJ Web of Conferences\n', ' \n in heavy ion reactions at Berkeley, Dubna, GSI, and \nRiken (Fig. 8). These elements are commonly called \nsuperheavy elements (SHE). \nAlready around the time of Seaborg’s extension of \nthe periodic table, nuclear shell model calculations \nrevealed [24] that an area of increased stability may exist \nfor nuclides around A~ 300, quickly named “island of \nstability”. However, due to the large neutron excess of \nthis island, it cannot be reached with present-day heavy \nion reactions. This may have to await neutron-rich \nprojectiles from future radioactive-beam facilities. So far, \nthe only way to search for a possible existence of these \nsuperheavy nuclides were searches in nature [25, 26]. An \nearly AMS experiment to search for the platinum \nhomologue 294110 (now  294Ds)  in a Pt placer nugget was \nperformed at the tandem accelerator of the University of \nPennsylvania [27]. An abundance limit of 10-11  was \nfound for  294110 in Pt by assuming that the half-life was \nabout 100 million years and the abundance in r-processed \nstellar material at the time of the formation of the solar \nsystem was 0.03 [28]. In none of the experiments [25-27] \nevidence for SHEs in nature was found. \n However, the group of A. Marinov et al. from \nJerusalem  recently reported positive evidence from highresolution\ninductively coupled plasma – sector field mass \nspectrometry (ICP-SF-MS) for  long-lived neutrondeficient\nTh isotopes [29], neutron deficient Rg isotopes \nin gold [30], and a SHE nuclide with A = 292 and Z ~ \n122  in thorium [31]. This triggered extensive AMS \nexperiments at the 14-MV tandem accelerator in Munich \n[32, 33], and at the 3-MV VERA facility in Vienna [3436].\nNone of the Marinov results were confirmed with \nAMS, with abundance limits several orders of magnitude \nbelow the one of the ICP-SF-MS experiments. In \naddition,  abundance limits were set for 30 nuclides \nwithin the ‘island of stability’ with respect to their host \nmaterials, Pt, Au, Pb, and Bi [35, 36]. The results are \nsummarized in Figure 9. Although an explanation for the \npositive results of the late Amnon Marinov and his group \nhas not been found, it is possible that unidentified \nbackground caused the observed events. AMS is far \nsuperior over ICP-SF-MS to remove spurious background \nevents. \n An alternative to AMS experiments is the search for \nhigh neutron multiplicity (>3) from spontaneous fission \nevents of SHEs. Such an experiment is performed by the \nDubna-Orsay collaboration on 550g Osmium in the \nFrejus tunnel underground laboratory [38]. An upper \nlimit for the abundance of Eka-Osmium (Hs) in Osmium \nat the level of 10-14 has been reported.  \n \nFigure 9. Summary of the results for searches of superheavy nuclides in nature. The basic layout of the figure is from [37], \ndepicting the upper end of the chart of nuclides. The shades of gray in the background indicate the relative stability of nuclides due \nto shell model corrections (darker means more stable). Nuclides marked in orange and red have been measured with AMS. \nAbundance limits measured with respect to the corresponding host material (see Fig. 8) are given in the violet boxes. The positive \nevidence of the Marinov experiments are shown in the blue boxes. \n \n03001-p.7\nHeavy Ion Accelerator Symposium 2013\n', ' \n4 Conclusion \nAccelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is arguably the \nmost powerful analytical tool to measure minute traces of \nlong-lived radionuclides in almost any domain of the \nenvironment at large. In this paper the enormous breadth \nof applications could only be touched upon briefly.  A \nmore complete description of AMS applications can be \nfound in Ref. [2]. Technical developments of AMS are \ndescribed in Ref. [1].  \n The 14C bomb peak dating shows great promise to \nstudy neurogenesis in various sections of the human \nbrain. Other parts of the body can be studied as well, e.g. \nheart muscles [39] and fat cells [40]. It is indeed \nrewarding that something so useful comes out from the \nnuclear weapons testing period. \n The basic problem for searches of SHEs in nature \ncan perhaps be described by asking: “Is the absence of \nevidence, evidence of absence?” An answer to this \nquestion can only be approached by improved \nmeasurements and improved (theoretical) predictions \nabout stellar production, physical and chemical \nproperties, and half-lives. This will gradually reduce \npotential loopholes, eventually leading to harder evidence \nfor a possible existence of SHEs in nature..   \nThe newest developments of suppressing \ninterfering isobars at the injection side of AMS tandem \nfacilities, will likely make the use of additional \nradionuclides feasible and expand the use of small AMS \nfacilities. This will enlarge applications of AMS into \nareas not yet available.   \n \n \nReferences \n1. H.-A. Synal, Developments of Accelerator Mass \nSpectrometry, in: Y. Litvinov, K.
