in\nteresting this church\nThe Sunday school at 930 am was\nlargely attended It being the month\nly missionary Sunday In the school\nMrJ P Phillips classr at the close\nof the lesson study rendered an excel\nlent little missionary program The\nmissionary contributions of the school\nyesterday amounted to 625\nThe sermons by the pastor ilev\nHoward Dutfll both morning and eve\nning were most impressively deliv\nered and were brimful of sound doc\ntrine and truth\nAt the morning service the follow\ning were received into the church by\ncertificate from from Methodist\nchurches elsewhere Mrs McClure\nand daughters Misses Josie and Geor\ngia from Anthony circuit and Mr\nand Mrs JW Crosby from Black\nshear Ga At the close of the service\nthe sacrament of the Lords Supper\nwas administered\nThe subject oft the evening sermon\nwa Christ or Barabbas or choic\nbetween Christ and the world Ba\nrabbas was represented as standing\nfor everything worldly and along this\nline was mentioned card parties s\npecially whist so frequent in our\ntown young boys scarcely out of\nknee pants learning to gamble the\ndance the liqior traffic whether in\nthe shape of dispensaries or

their full meaning orjnake\ntheir application\nMr Morris dissented as he thought\nhis hearers had as much sense as Ji\nhad While their avocations did not\nallow them to go into these subjectH\nas systematically and researchfully\nas his did they were no less able to\ncomprehend him\nHe defined faith under four heads\nhistorical germinative mystery and\nsanctificationand most interestingly\nand logically defined them God did\nnot build He created This world\nwas not thrown together It arose\nperfect in all its physical topography\nby Gods plan of creation\nHe made a few timely and pertinent\nremarks about the curbstone and dry\ngoods box critic\nThe person who did not belong to\nthe church was continually telling a\nwaiting gossiping world what those\ninside should do He remarked that\nhe believed even in a grumbling and\nfaultfinding church membership be\ncause all members no more than ajl\ncitizens could be ideal ones These\nchurch members werelike discontent\ned and faultfinding soldiers in the\narmy While they had their say and\ndissented often from conditions that\nenvironed them yet when the com\nmand was given to fall in and respond\nto the call to arms they did so and\nbore the brunt of the battle\nHow much better was that evidence\nin faith unseen than standing on the\noutside of the organization and criti\ncising everything within but taking\nno part in their duties To all he said\nshoulder your gun and follow and for\nsuch following you will be wiser and\nbetter To the agnostic he remarked\nYou know you know nothing yet\nstrangest of all inconsistencies you\nknow enough to know you know even\nthat which was answer sufficient t\nall such sophistry\nand\nHe closed with a beautiful\ntouchingly poetical invocation of\nChrists saving grace

KeT\nr\nr\nr\nt\nFinding a Fortune and\nI\nt Founding Fortune\nA TRAMPS LUCK AND AN EN\nERGETIC MANS PURPOSE\nf It is perhaps true as told that a tramp\nsearching a garbage barrel for scraps of\nt refuse food found a fortune in good\nUnited States currency Such a thing\nmay happen\nBut the workman who gt esup a\nsteady occupation however unremuner\nJ ati Veto hunt garbage barrels for a fort\nune will surely degenerate to a tramp\nTkere is a difference between finding a\nvalue When the stomach and the al\nlied organs of digestion and nutrition\nare diseased the nutrition contained in\nfood is imperfectly extracted and the\nbody fails of nutrition adequate to its\nneeds The shipwrecked sailor living\nupon scraps ia which there is no nutri\ntion is on a level with the man who eats\nabundant nutritious food but whose\nstomach with its allied organs is dis\neased and therefore fails to extract from\nthe food eaten the nutrition which ii\nthe bodys need\nSOUND STOMACH SOUND MAW\nThat is almost an axiom The man\nwith a sound stomach and good diges\ntion will in ordinary be a sound man\nbecause the nutriment of food is the life\nand strength of heart lungs liver kid\nneys and every organ of the body\nThe first need of a weak man is to\nlook after his stomach and his digestion\nThere is the common seat of physical\nweakness How weak men\nfortune and founding a fortune Few\nmen chance upon fortunes The fort\nunes we know about are not found but\nI founded on a certain substantial basis\nThe nature of that basis of fortune is\nJ well set fSrth in the advice given by a\nsuccessful merchant to a young man\nwho askea What is the first requisite\nto making a fortune The first re\nquisite to making a fortune said the\nrich man is health The idea that\nfortunes are made suggests toil and in\ndustry and skill Nothing can be made\nwithout these But a weak man cannot\ntoil and industry incompatible with\nillhealth If you want tobe strong\nremember that all physical strength\ncomes from food and that the amount of\nstrength extracted from food depends\nupon the ability of the stomach to di\ngest food and assimilate its n triti n\nit The man who takes care of his digestion\nl is in general taking care of every other\norgan of his body\nSUCCESS AND THE STOMACH\nThe merchant who gave the above\nopinion may not have been much of a\nphysician but he was a good deal of a\nphilosopher He had seen men with\nsuccess almost within the grasp break\ndown because of tt stomach trouble\nHe had theorized the saying that the\nweakest must go to the wall into the\nsaying that the man with the weakest\nstomach must go to the wall because\nL no man is stronger than his stomach\nThe man who will learn this lesson of\nr success has taken a great stride to his\nf goal Health is the first prerequisite of\nsuccess and health In general means a\ncound stomach and a good digestion\nLook at the logic of the matter Food\nis a mans life his strength Physical\nlife is sustained byfood But the fact\nthat thing can be eaten doesnt make\nit food Man a physician practising in\nthe tenements of a city says of failing\nmen or womentt What they need is\ni nourishing food n Shipwrecked rheu\neat scraps of leather the bark of trees\nanything to satisfy hunger But this is\nnot food in any true sense because it\n< contains no nutrition All food must\nbe considered in relation to its nutritive\nhave been made strong\nstrong of heart liver lungs\nkidneys and other organs\nby being made strong of\nstomach and strong of di\ngestion has been told

appro\npriate to give a brief sketch oltt\nmostly for the purpose of stating its\npresent phase\nThere were distributed some oi\nPresident G Stanley Halls circulars\non cnild study at the meeting of the\nState Teachers Association held at\nSt Augustine but the movement pro\nper began at the Tallahassee meet\ning here the present director made\nan exhibit 6t literature etc before\nthe association At this meeting child\nstudy was brought before the execu\ntive committee hich then decided by\na unanimous vote to have two articles\nread by way of introducing the sub\nject to the general association\nHe was further requested to inajre\nan exhibit of both literature and ap\nparatus before the association at\nT ampa just a little more than a yea\nago At the Tampa meeting child\nstudy created suchan interest\nthrough the exhibit and addresses\nthat it vjjks brought before the gen\neral association which by a unani\nmous voe made it a special depart\nment of the association This Child\nStudy Department consists of a child\nstudy committee and a director The\nstudy committee and a directorlhP\nmembers of the child study commit\ntee are the following President J\nF Forbes of Stetson University\nPrincipal C L Hayes of the Florida\nState Normal Prof W F Yocum of\nthe Florida Agricultural College Supt\nG P Glenn Jacksonville Prof Arj\nitiur Williams of the Florida State\nCollege and Principal JL Boone of\nthe Orlando high school The direc\ntor is Prof H E Bierly of the Flor\nIda State College Soon after the\nTampa meeting the child study de\npartment decided to make before the\nnext meeting which was held at\nOcala a special and very extensive\nexhibit of apparatus used in the phys\nical examination of children e g\nhearing seeing fatigue etc and on\nthe structure and development the\ncentral nervous system as was done\nduring the Christmas holidays Pres\nident Murphree read a very able and\nsuggestive article before the associa\ntion on the physical examination of\nchildren The exhibit at Ocala in\ncluded all such apparatus as is com\nmonly used in the examination of\nchildrens hearing seeing fatigue\netc also such psychological and phy\nsiological apparatus for a normal\ncourse in psychology Much of it\nwas such as has been devised and\nused in Prof Titchners Primer and\nOutlines of Psychology The depart\nment also gave considerable attention\nto kindergarten this year for which I\npurpose a subcommittee on kinder\ngarten was appointed with Mrs L B\nMathes as chairman Mrs J H Wells\nand Mrs George McFarland being the\nother members of the committee The\nkindergarten exhibits especially the\nSharpe kindergarten school at Ocalu\nand the article on kindergarten work\nby Miss Annie Sharpe before the gep\nerar nssociation aroused such an In\nterest that the Florida State Kinder\ngarten Association was organized\nwith Mrs L B v Mathes of Stetson\nUniversity as president The exhibit\nwas quite a success From two to\nthree hundred teaqhers and citizens I\nvisited every day A number of chil\ndren were examined by the director\nand his assistants Miss Mary Shutan\nand Mr Gaston Day both of the Flor\nida State College Many converts\nwere made among teachers and citi\nzens A few weeks ago the director ad\ndressed the Federation of Womans\nClubs on the subject of child study at\nCrescent City where its regular an\nnual meeting was held This organ\nization which is one of the most pow\nerful and influential in the state\nmade child study one of its subjects\nfor discussion during the coming year\nSome of the clubs belonging to this\norganization have been discussing\nthis subject at their meetings for the\nlast two years Child study as relat\ned to the county superintendent was\nalso brought to notice at the state\nmeeting of the county superintendents\na few weeks ago at Green Cove\nSprings At this meeting as well as\nthat of the Federation of Womans\nClubs of Florida some apparatus was\non exhibit and children were exam\nined\ninedThis child study department is at\npresent giving much attention to the\nphysical nature of the child as the\nproper foundation for the mental es\npecially to the medical supervision of\nthe hygtenic conditions of some of our\nlarger cities and towns by some local\nphysician also to the examination\nand medical advice of the defective\nchildren for whom no special provis\nions have been made but who are a\nsource of great annoyance to both\nteacher and school This feature of\nchild study was discussed by < ne di\nrector before the Florida State Medi\ncal Association at its meeting at Tam\npa a few days ago It has also boon\nplanned to bring this subject during\nthe year to the notice of Sunday\nschool teachers and churches The\npublic and religious press are quite\nfavorable to the movement A num\nber of teachers and mothers are tak\ning courses by correspondence anti a\ngeneral interest has aJad been cre\nated over the whole state\nA Circulating Library\nIn order that teachers instituteH\nwomans and mothers clubs kinder\ngarten associations and individuals\ncan study this subject the director\nhas planned and for which final ar\nngements have already been made\na circulating library on child study\nkindergarten nature study an < i gen\neral pedagogy This library will be\nready in a few months It will In\nelude all the best literature books\nand pamphlets on these subjects\nOnly a nominal price will be charge\nin order to pay for wear and tear\nClubs and Individuals will then b e\nable to have several books at a tim\nfor about three weeks It is only in\nthis way that we can meet the sr a t\ndemand for literature that is already\nmade\nThe Future of Child Study\nUnfortunately the director can give\nonly a very limited amount of time to\nthe work but from what has already\nbeen done bright future is already\nassured iit is kept in the hands o\nmen who will eliminate the fa < i and\nsuperficial features as much as possi\nble and will keep enthusiasm balance\nwith scientific insight Child study\nwhich is at the bottom of all this edu\ncational fermentation fails on no less\nwelcome and fertile soil in Florida\nthan in any other state Every teach\ner parent and citizen is keenly aware\nthat thetime has come for a better\nstudy of our children by sI entitle\nmethods The most recent textbooks\nand methods of instruction are based\neither directly or indirectly upon\nmodern child study The progressive\nteacher of today will have to meet it\nwhether he desires to do
