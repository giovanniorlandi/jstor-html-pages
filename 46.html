But things ;\nthat were tolerated a generation !\nago are obnoxious to those of this\ngeneration, and in all the thirty 1\nyears of his service in the senate !\nthings have never looked as threat\nening for Mr. Hale as they do this\nyear.\nJudge Fredrick A. Powers is the!\ncandidate against him, and it is de- \'\nelared that ii the direct nomination\nprevailed in Maine he would easily\nwin the election. And his prospects ,\nbefore the legislature is by no!\nmeans unfavorable. Senator Hale ,\nhas a strong arm hold on the party j\nas a whole, but it happens that the .\ncounties in which he is strongest1\nhave lately been sending Democrats ?\nto the legislature quite regularly, \'\nwhereas most of the Powers coun- j\nties send republicans. If this col- !\nleague of Mr. Aldrich, the man who\'\nranks second to him in the party of !\nthe Rhode Islanders and standpat- \'\nters, escapes defeat, he will at last\nhave gathered a heightened respect 1\nfor the strength of insurgency.\nAnd another place where insur-J\ngency is showing up strong is none j\nother than the district of John,\nDallzell, original standpatter, who\nis so intimately identified with an- !\nother phase of republican policies!\nthat if Cannonism did not bear that1\nname it would be called Dalzellism. i\nThe graft scandal in Pittsburg has !\nunsettled everything in politics and j\nthere is a vociferous demand for a\nchange in congress as well as else\nwhere. Mr. ^Dalzell is described\nas seriously alarmed, for-the first\ntime in twenty-two years, and\nhastily left Washington Saturday j\nfor Pittsburg to look after his\npolitical interests.\nIn difecussing Beveridge, Gover\nnor Marshall of Indiana in an inter\nview in the New York Times esti\nmates that "not more than 40 per\ncent of the republicans of that state\nare insurgents" while 60 per cent are\nstandpatters and not especially in\nterested in Beveridge. Forty per\ncent! How much would the most\nenthusiastic insurgent want? If\nthere arc 20 per cent it will mean\na Democratic Indiana delegationjn\nthe next congress. ? Republic.\nCONVICT MEN\n10 THE ASYLUM\nJame Bradford, an inmate of the\nstate Prison where he had been sent\nfrom. Esmeralda County on a bur\nglary charge to serve a term of\nnine years, was last evening taken\nto the Insane Asylum at Reno by\nCaptain Mullor. Bradford had\nserved nearly all of his term having\nless than nine months to remain.\nHe is affected with an extreme case\nof \'melancholia and it is believed\nthat he will not live long.\nIt will be remembered that a\nfew months ago this man had a fall\nat the prison landing upon^ Lhis\ncoccyx bone. Insanity at \'\'once\nshowed itself and afterjijtreatment\noi sometime at the prison he was\nexamined and ordered to be taken\nto the asylum. While the atten\ndants were preparing him for the\ntrip, he was allowed to slip on the\nfloor. landing again upon his coccyx\nbone. He immediately regained\nhis sense and the trip to Reno was\npostponed and it was thought that\nhe had entirely recovered. Later\nhowever the same old complaint\ncame upon him and he has been\ngrowing gradually worse until now\nhe is in a serious condition. It isj\npossible however that .treatment i\nwill cure him of his malady and he [\nwill again be brought to the prison !\nhere to serve out his term. ?
