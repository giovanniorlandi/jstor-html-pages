This\nvaluable document has been printed\nas a government publication, and\nanyone who patronizes the express\ncompanies to any extent should have\none in his possession. It is on sale\nat cost by the Superintendent of\n.Documents, Washington, D. C.\nUntil the government, compilation\nwas made there were some 900,000,-\n000 separate rates published by the\nexpress companies in hundreds of\nbooks and pamphlets. It was abso\nlutely impossible for any ordinary\nshipper to calculate a rate tor him\nself. It was next to impossible for\neven the agents of the express com\npanies to do so correctly, and as a\nresult complaints of overcharges\nand undercharges (mostly over\ncharges) were filed with the commis\nsion by the tens of-thousands.\nThe government statisticians\nhave now reduced these 900,00.0,000\nrates to less than 650,000. This has\nbeen done by dividing the country\ninto territorial blocks. By means of\nrate tables which are made up of key\nnumbers any person can find in five\nminutes the exact express rate on a\npackage of any Bize between any two\npoints in the United States.\nThe new rates to which these\ntables relate, will go into effect Octo\nber 23. They offer to the. consumer\nthe first real relief ever given from\nthe extortionate exactions of the\nexpress companies, who, having mon\nopolized a field that ought rightful\nly to be filled by the* railroads -and\nthe postoffice, have been able to take\nfrom commerce vast fortunes for the\nfew individuals who own most of the\nexpress stock.\nMany of the cuts are drastic. Oth\ners are left at about their present\nlevel. In some instances express\nrates have been raised by the new\norder. But the whole system of rates\nhas been worked out in a scientific\nway and with an eye single to the\ninterests of the people.\nIt may take the country some\nmonths of experience to find out the\nadvantages of the new rates. But\nvfrom an extended and careful study\n"of the new rates the following gen\neralization can be stated as approx\nimate truths:\n1. Parcel post rates Vre lower\nthan the net express rates on rail\npackages weighing .five pounds or\nless being shipped to any distance.\n2. Parcel \'post rates are lower\nthan the new express rates on all\npackages weighing 20 pounds or less\n-being shipped any distance up to\nil50 miles.\n3 "The fflew express rates are*\nlower than parcel post rates on\npackages weighing over five pounds\nshipped to any distance and on\npackages weighing over 20 pounds\nshipped 150 miles or \'farther.\nIt will he seexr-that the effect of\nthis order will be to give the parcel\npost a monopoly of the small pack-!\nage business and a monopoly of\ntpaekages weighing up to 20 pounds\n"for *hort distances. The express\ncompanies must take the long haul\nbusiness, which is the less profitable.\nIL i\' i. in\nLAST OF THE GROW IN-\nTJ1AN8 DVftD.\nSaginaw, Mich., Aug. 26.\nThe last of the Crows Is dead.\n*Oa *e*ef*atiMi ftaar ttagl\nnaw, Lueke itefinsep, an In\nftttt, aatd to be 120 years of\naga, passed away.
