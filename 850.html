        <pre>["Tasks Awaiting \nPresident Calles \nof Mexico\nByCARLETON BEALS\nAuthor of “Mexico: An Interpretation” \nand “Rome or Death.”\nI N England Ramsay MacDonald, \nBritish Labor Premier, fell from \npower; in the United States Senator \nLa Follette, as Labor’s candidate, trailed \na miserable third in the race for the \nPresidency; but in Mexico Plutarco \nElias Calles emerged victor in the na\xad\ntional elections and now sits confidently \nin the saddle as a so-called Labor Presi\xad\ndent. Why should Mexico, a frontier \ncountry, with not more than a million \nindustrial workers in a population of \n15,000.000, have put into power the \ncandidate of a Labor Party which con\xad\ntrols a poor minority in Senate and \nChamber? The Labor groups in Mex\xad\nico do not represent the aspirations of \nthe country as a whole; Labor has \nmerely become the strong common de\xad\nnominator. Labor has emerged as a \nstabilizing force after revolution for \nhalf a generation; or, to change the \nmetaphor, it is the straight line in the \nbroken pattern of Mexican politics. In \nshort, it is the one coherent civil power.\nLabor is not Mexico any more than \nthe Mexican Army was Mexico during \nits decades of abusive control of the \nnational destinie '.

Luis N. \nMorones, head of the Mexican Labor \nParty, who holds the post of Minister \nof Commerce. Industry and Labor. In \nother words, though the organized \ngroups that put Calles into power are \nfew and defined—the Labor Party, the \nNational Agrarian Party, headed by \nSeiior Soto v Gama; the pro-Calles Co-\n", '678 THE CURRENT HISTORY MAGAZINE Fkb.. 1925\noperatist Party, headed by the present \nMinister of Education. Puig Casaurang. \nand the army, controlled by ex-Presi- \ndent Obregon—Calles is actually the \nproduct of many diverse inchoate ten\xad\ndencies, such as Indian regionalism; \nand he owed his victory to the support \nof a number of outstanding personali\xad\nties, such as Alberto J. Pani, Minister \nof Finance, who though carefully ab\xad\nstaining from political affiliations, con\xad\ntrols a vast bureaucratic following. Can \nCalles hold these disparate forces, ten\xad\ndencies and personalities to one orderly \nline of conduct? Obregon "brought \nMexico back” to the Ufa/, tradition of \ninternal peace; can Calles retain his \nhold on the tiller for the next four \nyears?\nViolence has its own rhythm. As Mus\xad\nsolini, another great political realist, \nhas observed, “violence knows how to \nobey its internal limits. The Mexican \nrevolution of 1910, precipitated by that \ndreamer and fantastic spiritualist. Fran\xad\ncisco 1. Madero, and carried down to \nthe present time, has had in its recurring,, \nperiods of disorder a regularity com\xad\nparable to the swing of a pendulum. \nThe disorders in Mexico during the past \nfifteen years can be graphed into an \nupward and downward curve. The \npendulum swung most violently after \nthe murderous and drunken Vicloriano \nHuerta w’ent down and Villa and Car\xad\nranza split; now it is swinging to rest. \nThere are, apparently, in the life of all \npeoples almost unanalyzable forces that \nmake for coherence, for the resetting of \ntile social structure, much as a broken \nbone is mended and reknits. Calles \nhas entered the scene when peace is a \nlogical hope and possibility. The pur\xad\npose of this article is to discuss the \nproblems he has been called upon to \nface. They are many and dishearten\xad\ning. but not insurmountable.\nCalles’s most persistent problem of \npersonal control is the constant recon\xad\nciliation of two outstanding contradic\xad\ntory groups, Labor and the army. He \nmust also circumvent or conciliate the \nlanded proprietors, organized into the \nNational Syndicate of Agriculturists;\nhe must maintain good relations with the \nUnited States Government and make his \npeace with American business and com\xad\nmercial interests. In addition to domi\xad\nnating and reconciling these various \nconflicting interests, lie faces the three \nmajor problems of bureaucratism, fi\xad\nnance and agrarian reconstruction.\nProblem ok Controlling the Army\nThe first great problem is the army, \na hydra-headed Pratorian Guard, which, \nduring the hundred years of Mexican \nindependence, has made and broken the \nState. Not a national but a feudal \narmy; a military caste without civic- \npride or decency, imbued with a spirit \nof reckless adventure and plunder, ever \nready to stab the country in the back, \nFrom the day Mexico became independ\xad\nent of Spain in 1821 to the year 1876. \nwhen Porfirio Diaz spiked his sword \nin the doors of the National Palace, the \nnation was the dancing puppet of two \nregencies, two Emperors, various dic\xad\ntators. nearly twenty Provisional Presi\xad\ndents, twenty-three regular Presidents \nand one or two extraordinan bodies \nknown by sundry names. From 1910 \nto 1925 Mexico has whistled to the \ntunes of six major Presidents, Diaz. \nMadero. Huerta, Carranza. Obregon \nand Calles; six temporary or Provis\xad\nional Presidents, and various self-styled \nPresidents. While this instability has \nbeen rooted in racial, social and eco\xad\nnomic maladjustment, the armv has \nbeen the specific source of the numer\xad\nous unhappy betrayals that have [ire- \nvented most Mexican Presidents front\ndying in their beds. Twice onl\\ the\nhistory of the republic has it been dom\xad\ninated and subordinated to social ends, \nonce by Diaz, once by Obregon.\nOut of the flux of the recent revo\xad\nlutionary period emerged one popular \nmilitary genius, Alvaro Obregon. Some\xad\nthing of a social patriot, he was always \nmore comfortable when leading an army \nto victory. He is a great strategist and \nan indefatigable campaigner. To this \nday he controls the army of Mexico. \nHe has successfully bent it to his will \nand has curbed its worst excesses. He\n', "F eb ., 1925 TASKS AWAITING PRESIDENT CALLES OF MEXICO 679\nalone possesses the loyalty of the \nYaquis, the terrible Apaches of the \nnorth, on whom has rested the back\xad\nbone and strength of his regime. And \nthough Obregon has been honestly try\xad\ning to create a truly national army in\xad\nstead of an amorphous rabble dependent \nupon personal leadership, upon caudil- \nlos, it is doubtful whether he can pass \nthis inheritance on to Calles. Calles \nmust continue to govern with the sup\xad\nport of Obregon. If the Sonora duum\xad\nvirate can be maintained, if Calles is \nfarsighted enough to win the constant \nloyalty of Obregon, his chances of suc\xad\ncess are immeasurably incleased, and \nthe army can be successfully subordi\xad\nnated to the social needs. His one alter\xad\nnative would be to break the army \nswiftly and drastically and create a new' \nnational corps. Rut here, too, he would \nhave to count upon the accord of Obre\xad\ngon. There have been rumors that Calles \nintends to inaugurate universal military \ntraining as a means of offsetting the \npower of the professional militarists, \nat the same time unifying the country \nand rapidly doing away with illiteracy.\nU Calles can keep the army in its place, \ndirough friendship with Obregon, \nthrough shrewdly undermining it or by \nsubstituting some other armed group, he \nmay emerge as the great social realist \nof the revolution in Mexico. Certainly \nhe is primarily a social leader rather \nthan a militarist. He has found his \nchief backing in the rather inchoate \nlabor and peasant movement of the \ncountry.\nRut in favoring that movement in\xad\nstead of the army, he immediately faces \nconflicts of jurisdiction. De Negri, \nObregon’s Minister of Agriculture, re\xad\ncounted to me some of the difficulties \nin connection with the program of land \nrestitution. As a result of the de la \nHuerta revolt the professional militar\xad\nists for the time being regained some\xad\nthing of their power and license. All \nover the country they seized vast prop\xad\nerties under the pretext that the owners \nhad abetted the rebellion of de la \nHuerta. Since then they have constantly \nobstructed the efforts of the National \nAgrarian Commission to administer \nthese properties. In' many instances the\nP re s id e n t C a lle s  w ith  h is predecessor, C7eneral O bregon, a t  th e  in au g u ra tio n  ce rem o n y  on\nN ov. 30, 1024\n", "680 THE CURRENT HISTORY MAGAZINE F kb.. 1925\nlanded proprietors have voluntarily \nplaced their holdings under the protec\xad\ntion of tlie General in their particular \n“region.” The General, in return for a \ncomfortable compensation, defies the \nefforts of the local Agrarian Commission \nto expropriate any portion of the prop\xad\nerly. Bands of agraristas then take \nthe field; there is a miniature civil war. \nin which the regular authorities of the \nState Government oppose the agraris\xad\ntas, as in Michoacan, or abet them, as in \nVera Cruz. The whole bizarre situation \nindicates the general lack of security \nand the laxness of the Federal Govern\xad\nment. At the same time it indicates that \nthe army still stands outside normal \nfunctioning of the law and will be a \ndisturbing factor in any constructive \nsolution of the national problems.\nThus Calles is confronted, first of all, \nwith the problem of guiding and har\xad\nmonizing the most powerful organized \nfactions that stand behind the throne of \nMexican politics. In most modern de\xad\nmocracies there is a normal play of the \nvarious social and political groups. But \nin Mexico the conflict is between a \nfeudal militarism and an aroused popu\xad\nlace dangerously imbued with the loose \nsophisms of the Russian revolution. \nCentralized governmental sovereignty is \nat stake. This would seem to throw \nCalles with demagogery. But the only \norganized groups of workers and peas\xad\nants of any great strength are not Bol\xad\nshevistic, and as their power increases \nand their knowledge grows, they have \nshown themselves increasingly cautious. \nI refer particularly to the Mexican Re\xad\ngional Confederation of Labor and the \nNational Labor Party, which supported \nCalles for President. But in any case \nthe functioning of popular groups in \nMexico is uncertain. In most countries \nthe interplay of the various organized \nforces of the country would result in a \ncomfortable shifting of public opinion; \nin Mexico it is too apt to lead to civil \nwar. Calles must check the army and \nrestrain the too vociferous among his \nown following.\nWhat are some of the more construc\xad\ntive problems of the Administration?\nFirst, the purification of the bureau\xad\ncracy. This is urgent, vitally urgent. \nNowhere in the world is there a more \nvicious bureaucracy than in Mexico. A \nmodern Dante wandering through the \nworld would put the Mexican bureau\xad\ncrats in the low'est circle of hell. This \ngroup considers itself the salt of the \nearth; it possesses the divine right of \nholding sinecures. The number of per\xad\nsons dependent upon the Government \nfor livelihood has increased tenfold \nsince the time of Diaz. But the new\xad\ncomers have rapidly absorbed the vices \nof the traditional group. The Mexican \nbureaucrat considers it his manful obli\xad\ngation to steal. Nothing is too petty \nfor his attention—from pins to auto\xad\nmobiles, from paper clips to haciendas \nand oil concessions. He pads the pay\xad\nrolls with salaries for his mistresses, \nwhose business value in the govern\xad\nmental offices is virtually nil. He \nspends hours in the corner cantina \ndrinking cognac with boon political \nconfreres. Hardly anything is bought \nor sold by the Mexican Government \nwithout the corresponding rake-off. A \nshipper can whistle till doomsday for \nfreight cars, his fruit and vegetables \ncan rot on the siding, unless he pays \nthe customary “contribution.” In view \nof the pressing needs of the Mexican \nexchequer the situation is desperate. \nThe Mexican Government is the biggest \npaymaster in Mexico. Inefficiency or \nderangement of its normal functioning \nis today ten times as serious as it was \na decade ago. The school teachers re\xad\ncently went without two months’ pay \nand the business life of the capital was \nwell-nigh paralyzed. Calles cannot \nhope to inaugurate any sound reforms \nuntil he has cleansed the Augean stables \nof greed and graft and stringently cur\xad\ntailed the number of useless hangers-on.\nThe financial situation of the Gov\xad\nernment is highly unsatisfactory. Mex\xad\nico has blundered through a number \nof years without any foreign assistance \nor adequate taxation system. It can do \nso again, perhaps. But today the needs \nof the farm population are far more \npressing than when Obregon look office.\n", "F eb ., 1925 TASKS AWAITING PRESIDENT CALLES OF MEXICO 681\nInternational\nG E N E R A L  P L U T A R C O  E L IA S  C A L L E S  \nA p h o to g rap h ic  s tu d y  of M exico 's n ew  P re s id e n t\nThe key problem of the sta\xad\nbility of the Mexican Gov\xad\nernment is the land prob\xad\nlem, and the key to the so\xad\nlution of the land problem \nduring the next few years \nis adequate national funds \nfor creating rural credits, \ncompensating the despoiled \nhacendados (owners of \nranches) and promoting ir\xad\nrigation and conservation \nprojects. These things are \nurgently and vitally indis\xad\npensable. Money is need\xad\ned. Mexico will have to \nwork out a more effective \nmanner of levying and col\xad\nlecting taxes, doubly diffi\xad\ncult because of the semi\xad\nparalysis of farming, min\xad\ning and manufacturing; or \nshe will have to resort to a \nforeign loan, which may or \nmay not be forthcoming.\nMexico cannot continue to \nlive from hand to mouth on \nthe petroleum taxes.\nThe present status of the \nagrarian problem of Mex\xad\nico is deplorable. Any \nsane individual will have \nto face the truth that the \nwholesale statements made \nby Calles during his so\xad\njourn in New York about \ncontinuing the work of \nObregon, of standing by \nthe ideals of the agrarian rebel \nZapata, of lavishly providing the \nIndians with lands, is dust in the \neyes or plain stupidity. To con\xad\ntinue the land policy of Obregon along \nthe present lines means national suicide. \nNo one has praised Obregon’s initial \nefforts to solve the land problem more \nunstintedly than myself. But. best \nstated. Obregon never touched the land \nproblem or made a beginning at solv\xad\ning it. What he solved was the military \nproblem; by his prompt concessions to \nsuch land rebels as Villa, Cedillo and \nothers, by his guarantee to the peons of \nMexico that every individual had the\nright to a patrimony, he promptly paci\xad\nfied the country, amazingly pacified it. \nBut since then times have changed. To\xad\nday the rapid distribution of lands in \nvarious States, especially Vera Cruz, \nSan Luis Potosi and elsewhere, is having \na boomerang effect.\nLand Problem Solution Vital\nThe prime necessity in the reconstruc\xad\ntion of a people after a social disrup\xad\ntion (as Russia has proved) is the rapid \nrestimulation of the agrarian life, the \nneed that production in the most vital \nof human activities shall not he cur\xad\ntailed. In Mexico farm production has\n", "682 THE CURRENT HISTORY MAGAZINE Feb., 1925\nbeen seriously curtailed. The hacen- \ndados have all had portions of their \nestates taken away. Payment was made \nfor these with interest-bearing bonds, \ncs yet having no negotiable value. Had \nthis expropriation been rapid, decisive, \nwell defined, the results would not have \nbeen so disastrous. As it is, the hacen- \ndados have no idea where the expropri\xad\nation will halt; they have no real pro\xad\ntection against the demands of the local \nagrarian commission or the bands of \nroving Agraristas that make the sowing \nof new crops difficult and dangerous. \nThere was no real excuse for the badly- \nplanned arid worse executed forfeiture \nof cultivated lands in Mexico, except, \nperhaps, where a hacienda was stran\xad\ngling a village, for there is land enough \nto satisfy every need. When Obregon \ntook office he declared that but 2 per \ncent, of the rich southern area was un\xad\nder cultivation. It is true that the un\xad\nused lands needed to be cleared, devel\xad\noped. irrigated, and the recipient fur\xad\nnished with tools and seed and capital. \nThe Government, despite its financial \nembarrassment, should have developed \nnew lands without disturbing any more \nthan was necessary for pacification and \nliberating certain village lands already \nunder cultivation.\nThe result has been that the poor \npeon, given property-, harvests only the \nfirst crop; his poverty and lack of \nknowledge prevent him from resowing \nthe land the second year. He there\xad\nfore creeps back to the hacendado to \nask for work. But the hacendado can \ntake fin no extra hands; he is cultivat\xad\ning, if at all, a small portion of his \nestate. The peon, desperate, then turns \nto the local agrarian commission and \nasks for more lands, usually just be\xad\nfore harvest time. Whereupon the \ncommission, after the hacendado has \nspent money and time bringing a crop \nto maturity, promptly expropriates the \ncultivated land to give to the peons. \nThis is nothing more than a legalized \nform of crop-raiding; and though the \nlaw ostensibly offers protection against \nsuch measures, the hacendado usually \nhas no effective remedy. In primitive\ndays one tribe warred on another at \nharvest time to steal the crops. The \nsame thing has been taking place in \nMexico in a more dignified but a no \nless disastrous manner.\nSuch a state of affairs cannot con\xad\ntinue. Mexico, a raw product country, \nis placed in the ludicrous position of \nimporting such foodstuffs as corn and \nother cereals. The Government is pre\xad\ncariously living off the petroleum in\xad\ndustry to make up for the lost balance; \nit is not reconstructing its basic indus\xad\ntry-, agriculture. And this is what Gallcs \nmust do, or the overriding laws of sup\xad\nply and demand, of hunger, or curtailed \nproduction, the vicious circle of no buy\xad\ning power set off against the inability \nto produce, will precipitate the country \ninto a chaos more disastrous than it has \nyet suffered and from which the resur\xad\nrection of its people will be tenfold \nmore arduous, painful and dubious. \nThat Obregon saw which way the wind \nwas blowing was evidenced by a belated \ndecree, issued just before his retirement, \nthat no lands should be distributed to \nvillages which had not put the lands \nalready in their possession under ade\xad\nquate cultivation. Calles, shortly after \ninauguration, made a statement wiser \nthan any made during his campaign:\nThe application of agrarian laws has pro\xad\nduced, in part, the benefits desired by tin- \nrevolutionary Governments. But these benefits \nwill not, in my opinion, be completely obtained \nuntil the land problem is handled in a thor\xad\nough and cohesive manner, which shall include \nnot merely the giving of lands, hut which shall \nalso guarantee production, insuring that the \nperson who receives land he furnished, in addi\xad\ntion, with seeds, water, implements and credit \nnecessary to cultivate the soil.\nCalles told me of an extensive project \nto link up the workmen's compensation \nprovision of the Constitution with the \ncreation of a large floating fund for ag\xad\nricultural development. In other words. \nCalles, while extending economic and \nother rights, must keep in sight the laws \nof economic stability which rule the \nlives of nations. The problem is similar \nto that in Russia: to reconcile popular \nrights with the need for increased ma\xad\nterial production.\n"]</pre>
