This morning\nwas extremely quiet along the\ncenter of the salient where the Germans\nwere not offering great oppo\naiuuii*\nOn both wings, however, the\ngreatest activity prevails. The enemy\nhas massed many heavy guns\nto the north of Soissons on the\nheights around Juvigny and Chavigny,\nwhence they bombarded with\n\' an enfilating fire the western wing\nas far south as Oulchy-le-Chateau.\nNotwithstanding this bombardment\nthe allies in the Oulchy-le-Chateau\nregion are making some progress,\nalthough they, are lacea oy tne uermans\'\nbest divisions and the concentrated\nfire of numerous machine\nguns.\nOn the eastern wing the allies\ngradually are obtaining command of\nthe whole road leading from Dormans\nto Rheims. On this side also\nthe Germans have assembled a great\nforce of artillery in the neighborhood\nof St. Thierry northwest of\nRheims. These guns cover the German\nleft flank and consequently\nmake the progress slower for the\nallies.\nFall Back for M3m.\nThe retreat of the German Crown\nPrince\'s forces, along the whole\nMarne front has reached a more pre\nIcipitate phase. At some places the\nGermans have fallen back for a distance\nof several miles. French and\nAmerican troops are harrying there\ntiring forces on the center while\nFrench and British troops are hammering\nat both flanks.\nCavalry and tanks in considerable\nnumbers have succeeded in eettiner\nI in, and are bombarding their columns\non the march.\nWOMAN IN FRANCE GREETS\nSOUTH CAROLINA SOLDIERS\nCamp Sevier, Greenville, July 25.\n?Members of the One Hundred and\nEighteenth Infantry, formerly the\nFirst South Carolina Regiment, National\nGuard, now with the Thirtieth\nDivision overseas, were agreeably\nsurprised recently to find that\nCamp Sevier is not unknown, even\nin Prance, according to a letter recently\nreceived here.\nMembers of the command were\non a hike through a certain part of\nEurope when they stopped for a\nrest near a little farm house. The\nJady of the house came out and engaged\nthe men in conversation and\nlearned that they had trained at\nCamp Sevier. She immediately invited\nthem into her house and entertained\nthem grariously. Then she\nshowed them a picture of Camp Sevier\nand told them she knew all\nabout the place as her son had served\nas an instructor of the French\nadvisory mission. She exhibited\nwith much pride a photograph of\nthe young officer.\nI The Citadel has made distinguished\nrecord at Plattsburg. The cadets\nsent from this institution to the\nsummer camp have been rated so\nhighly that twenty-five were retained\nas instructors for the second\ncamp.\nFRONT\nRMANS RETIRE\nft\nAbbeville Boy\nWounded In France\n| LIEUT. ERNEST VISANSKA IS IN\nA BASE HOSPITAL ON THE\nI" BATTLEFIELDS OF FRANCE\n(Greenwood Journal, July 27.)\nA dispatch from The Daily Journal\'s\nCharleston correspondent this\nmorning brought the news that Lieut\nErnest Visanska had been slightly\nwounded in France, the Lieutenant\'s\nbrother, Mr. Julius M. Visanska hav-!\ning received a cablegram to this effect.\nLieut. Visanska went to France\nlast September with Lieut Ernest\nRosenberg who is now an instructor\nat Camp Sherman, Ohio, and the two\nwere together almost constantly in\nthe trenches and on the firing line\nuntil the latter was brought back to\nAmerica by-the War Department\nfor special work.\nLieut.

When America\ndeclared war against Germany he\nvolunteered his services, although\'\nbeyond the draft age (he is 36 years\nold) and went to Fort Oglethorpe\nand he was commissioned a second\nlieutenant.

Lieut.\nVisanska is a graduate of Exeter\nAcademy and Yale and of the Virginia\nLaw School. He was making\na brilliant record in law when he\nwen* into the service of his country.\nFriends of the family here regret\nto know that he has been wounded,\nbut are encouraged to believe that\nhis injuries are only slight and that\nhe soon will be able to return to his\nduties.\nMrs. A. Rosenberg was notified by\nlong distance telephone later this\nmorning by Mrs. P. Rosenberg that\nshe had received a cablegram from\nLieut. Visanska in which he stated\nthat he had been wounded in the ankle\nand was now at Base Hospital\nNo. 6, Bordeaux, Fnmce. He said\nthat his condition was not cause at\nall for worry and that he was all\nright."\nLieut. Visanska is an Abbevile\nboy, having been raised here. Hisj\nfather, Mr. G. A. Visanska, died\nseveral years ago. Mr. Philip Rosenberg,\nbrother-in-law to the lieutenant,\ncould add nothing further\nto the account as printed above.\nSEVENTY COLORED MEN\nLEFT YESTERDAY FOR CAMP\nThe war is still going on. Seventy\nnegro men, who left for Camp Wadsworth\nyesterday morning, can vouch\nfor this fact. An early hour found\nthe square well filled with colored\npeople and the number steadily in\nJ -11 4-1?~..~U Tf\nt\'ltascu ail tlUUUgll blic XVJ.CUUV11I XVI\nlooked almost as though Saturday.\nhad postponed its visit two days.\nOnly two draftees failed to show\nup.

This second\nfactor is of more importance\nthan most people realize. An unexpected\ncheck to troops on march is\nalways troublesome. Men wonder\nwhat has happened. Sudenly bombs\nbegin to fall, men are killed, horses\nstampede, wagons are smashed and\nthe road blocked.

As a cold tact,\ncomplete mastery of the air could\nonly come if there were no German\nmachines able to take the .air.\n"Superiority is another matter,\nand it is true that at the mrapent\nthis may be claimed by the vies.\noYamnlo the British record of\nbombs dropped in April shows twelve\nto one against the Germans. Th<\npresent superiority can be maintained\nand must be maintained, not\nonly on general grounds, but particularly\nfor the development of the\nnew tactics of the low-flying airplane.\n"What is needed is more mchlnes\nand more trained men, and it is the\npeople, the men and women of the\n"l\'\'0\'1 nnntifn\'oi: who in the lj*St\nanalysis must give or withhold etfective\nsuperiority in the air."\nThe munition workers striking at\nCoventry, England, will have to\nwork or fight, Premier Lloyd George\nannounced Friday.

I\nunderstand there will be several\ntractors demonstrated and that the\nFord tractor wjll be one of them.\nAll farmers interested in tractors\nare urged to attend this meeting on\nJuly 31 at Greenwood.\nLabor is very scarce and are in\nprice now and you farmers will\nnever see labor plentiful or cheap\nany more, and the question is how\nare we going to meet this shortage\nin labor. So many farmers ask me\nthis question, and the only answer\nthat I or anyone else can give is\nthis: "Go to using labor-saving\nmachinery." We will have to follow\nthe example of the Northern and\nWestern farmer, who are and have\nbeen for years past using llaborsaving\nmachinery. Here is a twoplow\ntractor burning kerosene as\nfuel and will break six acres of land\neach day. It will cost around $1.33\nto operate the tractor, including\nman\'s labor, oil, grease, kerosene,\nrepairs, depreciation and interest on!\nthe money. In other words, it coat\n$7.98 to break six acres of land.\nNow break this six acres of land\nwith a plow drawn by a horse and\nit will cost more money, more time,\nand the work won\'t be done as\ngood. \'\nThis is a time when, we will have\nto use some substitute for the\nsoarce and dear labor, and I hope to\nsee all fanners who are interested\nin tractors sLt Greenwood on July\n3ist.

Crowder Says Men Cannot Be\nReleased For Navy, Marine Corps\nor Shipyards.\nWashington, July 26.?The rapid\nexhaustion of Class One to the ex\ntent that some local boards may be\nunable to fill the August call was in^dk^ted\nby them today.\nCrowder declared that he would\nbe unable to place further August\ncalls until all the men who registered\nJune 5 are finally examined and\nclassified.

"I\nurge district and local boards to\nexert every effort to make a sufficient\nnumber of men available to fill\nthe August calls and instruct medical\nadvisory board to speed up examination\nof registrants as yet unexamined,"\nCrowder said, requesting\nthat boards advise him at once\nwhether they will be able to fill\nAugust call*.\nSENATOR BENET ON\nCOTTON SITUATION\n: Pears Fall in Price of Staple?Favors\nOrganizing Holding Corporation?Government\nAid.\nColumbia, July 25.?Senator\nChristie Benet gave out the following\nstatement tonight: "Upon my\nreturn to Columbia Saturday night,\nfrom the campaign in the Peedee, I\nfound information from Washington\nawaiting me here about the cotton\nsituation which made it necessary\nfor me to stay in Columbia today\nto put my efforts behind the\ngovernment to organize a cotton\nholding corporation to take- over\nsuch cotton as the farmers care to\nsell. It seems fairly certain from\nthe reports of the agricultural experts\nthat the 1918 cotton crop will\nbe between 15,000,000 bales with a\ndemand in sight for only 11,000,000\nbales. This means but one thing:\nThat the price of cotton will fall.\nIf the financial situation in the\nSouth is to be maintained so tlhat\nour people can not only meet their\nusual obligation but do their full\npart in the Liberty Loan, War\nStamp, R?d Cross, Y. M. C. A., and\nother war subscriptions, it will be\nnecessary to work out some plan now\nto meet the situation which seems\nlikely to come about./\n"The plan which seems most feasible\nis for the government to organize\na cotton holding corporation\nwhich will agre* to buy cotton at a\nprice which will give the farmers a\nfair rofnm fnr his Inhor nnH invest-1\nment. He will not have to sell at\nthis price, but wil lhave a certain\nmarket if he does want to sell. If\nthe crop is smaller than expected or\nthe demand is greater the government\nmay not have to buy any cotton,\nbut the fact that the government\nstands ready to buy will maintain\nconfidence and will enable the\nfarmers to hold his cotton and borrow\non it himself while waiting for\nhigher price. It may be that the\nmere announcement that the government\nis in the market to buy cotton\nwill be sufficient, but in case the\ngovernment does have to buy it will\nbe a safe investment as the government\ncan easily carry it until after\nthe war, when there will be a great\ndemand for every bale.\n"I am taking the matter up vigorously\nwith the proper authorities at\n"Washington and expect to go there\nlater this week for a personal conference.\nAt this time nothing definite\ncan be given out, but I am\nhopeful that some such plan can be\nput through. The matter was so important\nthat today I stayed in Columbia\nto work on the proposition.\nIt is likely that I will have to stay\nhere tomorrow for the same purpose.\nTEN WAR COMMANDMENTS\nFor the French People?and For\nOur People.\nParis, July 26.?The economic\nand social section of the League of\nPatriots, with headquarters in Paris,\n4 Rue Ste.

What this means\nto the cotton growers of the South\nand the industry as a whole can hard\n1 y be estimated in dollars and cents,\nbut the curtailment of the weevil\'s\nactivities, even in small part, is so\nimportant as to make the discovery\nby the Department of Agriculture\nof the fact that arsenicals may be\nused as a powder spray in controlling\nthis pest one of its most striking\nand valuable contributions to the\nagricultural industry.\nPoison Weevil\'s Drinking Water\nMr. B. R. Coad, of the Bureau of\nEntomology, while working on some\nbiological investigations of the boll\nweevil, found that although the weevils\nare not hard drinkers, they drink\nregularly from the rain or dew collected\nin droplets on the leaves of\nthe cotton plants. Having been on\nthe trail of the cotton boll weevil\nfor some time, his logical inquiry\nwas, "Why not poison the water\nwhich the weevils drink?" Sincc\n1913 Mr. Coad, with a corps of entomologists\nwith headquarters at\nTallulah, La., has been experimenting\nwith various poisons applied in\ndifferent ways, all with the purpose\nof administering a dose which would\nbe latai to tnese msecus wmvu uaw\ninvaded such a large part of the\ncotton-producing territory of the\nSouth.\nThese entomologists have not finished\ntheir work, but they have proved\nby a series of experiments that\nboll weevils can be poisoned under\nfield conditions and that poisoning\nis a practicable method of controll*\nDUS |\ns\nS3\nP J\n>DSj\nund in\non Co.
