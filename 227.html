M. Fenwich\nbegan experimenting with this powder\nas a base material for soap and it\nwas only by accident that he dis\ncovered its superior merits as a den-\ntrifice, and recently he interested Geo.\nA.

In the cast the summer beat becomes un\nbearable and there is little relief at the .seaside or the lakes because\nof the great number of people who flock to these places. New Orleans\nand Phoenix in the south are almost synonymous with beat in the\nfiiunmer and the last-named place is especially avoided by the traveller\nduring the w,arm months.\nHere in Nevada the thermometer seldom goes above ninety de\ngrees during the day time and the nights are so cool that one\'s sleep\nis never disturbed by heat. A minimum of between fifty and sixty\ndegrees is the figure the Reno weather bureau gives almost daily,\nand surely that is a most desirable temperature for the summer\nmonths.\nThe state loses nothing, in comparisons of weather, with other\nstates.\nBILL HART is seeing the Frankenstein monster. He is com\nplaining that he is getting too much publicity.

This re\nadjustment was to be worked out like j MRS\nihat for civil government employes who\nnart tlie.r compensation increased and .
