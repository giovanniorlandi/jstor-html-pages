July 23.—To\nday President Roosevelt defended\n\' t-e bombinq of Rome and place-<\nthe blame for the raid on th?\nFascist leaders who have blunt\nly refused to declare the Italian\ncapital an open city. The Presi\ndent disclosed that lor more tha:\'\n; a year the Allies have tried to\nhave the Italian leaders declare\nRome an open city, but they re\nfused to budge from their deci\nfion to maintain intact the many\nmilitary installations in Rome.\nThe President asserted that the\nbombing of Rome was done to,\nsave the live* of American mmA\nBritish soldiers now fighting in\nSicily. It was pointed out that\nthe marshalling yards and rail\nroad centers in Rome, which\nwere given a terrific blasting,\nwere used by the German and\nItalian high commands in trans\nporting troops and supplies to\nthe toe of the Italian boot for\neventual transshipment to Sicily\nto be used in fighting against\nthe Allied trooos there.\nA second series of photographs\ntaken by Allied ftyers demon -\nftrate again that the raid not only\ncaused vast devastation but also\nwas carried out according to\nschedule, which was to avoid\nbombinq sacred and historic\nbuildings. It was added that in\nsome cases buildings of that na\nture adjeined the military ob\njectives and were damaged by\nthe concussions from exploding\nbombs.\nTer vast fires were still burn\ning when the second series of\nphotographs were taken. The\nvast railroad yards are flaming\nand smoking ruins; freight cars\nard trooo trains are smoldering\nheaps of twisted steel, and the\nbarracks on the entire eastern\nside of the marshalling yards arc\ndevastated.\nThe ruins could have been\navoided, it was slated had tha\nrulers of Italy declared Rome an\nopen city, but, orobably incited\nby Hitler and his warlords, they\nrefused to do so, and whatever\nblame is attached to the rati\nrightly should be placed on their\nshoulders.\nFOR WAR SERVICES\nBALTIMORE Along t..\nshorrs f the* Great Iw<k*\\- and\nthe Mississippi River. s76s.*NKi.*Kl*i\nworth of sva-going vessels ar- Im\niiig built for war services.\nCLUB\nSUGALOA\nNow Open\nUnder New Management\nDANCE\nto the MUSIC of\nJOHN PRITCHARD and HIS\nORCHESTRA\nFRED TAYLOR.

It was nearly\nsix o\'clock, that always exciting\nhour in Mexico City w’hen all the\nj auto horns in the world seem to\nannounce the end of another\nslow warm afternoon. I listened <\nto the tootling and blaring of the,\ncars down below on the avenidas I\nand remembered that I was in j\nthe room next to that of Sam ;\nTaggard\'s daughter. My boss. Lew\nFall, had already preceded me to\nMexico City. He had informed me\nthat she had been questioned of- !\nficiaUy. I was to make her ac\nquaintance unofficially In four\ndays I\'d failed to get beyond a\nkeep-yo Or-distance smile. For a\ntin specialist, it wai definitely one\nhell of an occupation, t\nAn argument was going on in\nMiss Taggard’s room. The argu\nment was in Spanish and I un\nderstood very little of it. My\nlimited Spanish is that of a min\ning engineer\'s and the man in\nthe room with her wasn\'t dis\ncussing milling or smelting.\nI KNEW he wasn\'t her husband\nor her lover: Fall had given\nme all the pertinent details about\nMiss Taggard: Twenty - three\nyears of age: -Born in Rio de Ja\nneiro; resident ir. Latin America\nalmost all of her life: mother dead\neighteen years: no occupation;\nn* ver short of money: possibility\nof being involved with the Ges\ntapo; no proof of such involve\nment except loyalty to her father.\nListening. I didn\'t need a dic\ntionary to know that the man was\ngiving her hell. His words had a\nthin whining edge to them I\nwandered who he was. Fall\nnadn\'t mentioned angry Spanish\nvisitors.\n"Get out of this room!” She\nwas speaKing, now, in English,\nHer voice had a sharp tang to it\nthat made me recall her smile. I\nleaned from the bed and walketH\nto the door My heart was bang\ning away in my chest.\n“Get out of this room!” she\nrepeated. “I don’t know where\nmy father is.

Irion, general manager of the\nj New Of>era Company, and the\n(only woman opera producer in\ni America. A woman, who looks\nj like Schumann Heink. loves op\n|era like Wagner, and works like\n| a coal miner. A woman who has\njthe nerve to try to make Broad\n! way pay for grand opera.\nShe has already made a good\nJ start in that direction. Last No\n! vember the New Opera opened\nI its second season with Rosa !\nj iinda." The piece proved such a\n: success that the company let iti\nj run and moved to another the- 1\n! ater to continue its regular reper- i\ntoire. Its season ended last De\ncember. but "Rosalinda \' is still\nrollng up receipts which will be\na big help in financing the New\nOpera\'s third season.\nThat begins August 4 (to catch’\nthe vacation crowd) with Lehar\'s\n‘‘Merry Widow". The conductor,\nis the same Robert Stolz who di-j\nI reeled the original version in\n] 1906, but the music and book\'\ni have been revamped.\n"You can\'t do something j\nwhich was a success 35 years\nago and expect it to give as\nmuch pleasure now as it did\nthen." says Mme. Mero-Irion.\n\' You must keep up with the\nchange in people\'s tastes."\nMme. Mero-Irion has lived in\nmusical circles all her life.

July 23 <FNS*—\nProduction of dehydrated lemon-,\ngrass pulp and molasses feed to\nbolster current feed shortages\nis under way in the Everglades\n! Officials of the United State:\nSugar Corporation reported this\nweek that with the closing of\n. the sugar harvest season, labo"\nis once more available for this\nwork.\nLemongrass plants were bad\nly damaged by freezing weather\nlast February so that production\n; had to be suspended at that\nt time. but now the production is\nagain under way, according to\n! general manager Jay W Moran.\n• v.ho said that the feed will be\n• distributed exclusively in Flor\n| lda.\nyears of domesticity and concert\nwork. When the depression\nstruck the country Mme. Mero-\nIrion helped found the Musicians\' i\nEmergency Fund to aid stranded\nj musicians. Eventually she became\nthe fund\'s executive director and\nthat job led to her present one.\nShe and Mrs. Lytle Hull (the\nformer Mrs. Vincent Astor) be\ncame convinced that a loi of,\nyoung American talent was go\ning to waste and founded the\nNew Opera in 1941 “to give\nyoung talented artists an oppor\ntunitv to perform in highly ar\n• tistic surroundings."\n>We have many excellent\nmusicians here now.** Mme.\nMero-Irion told me as she\nturned from plans for the ,\ncompany\'s third season. "Once\nAmerica had to import all its\nbest talent and teachars. But\nsince the last war talent has\nbeen sifting in in greater num\nbers and remaining. Great\nschool sand great orchestras\nhave been built up. We have\nbetter symphony orchestras\nnow than Europe ever had. Af\nter this war it will be America\nwho exports the artists."\nAs general manager of the New\n, Opera. Mme. Mero-Irion selects\n_ the opera, cast, costumes, scen\nery, stage and music directors\ni for every production. She runs\nj that man-sized job with a wom\nlan’s passion for detail.
