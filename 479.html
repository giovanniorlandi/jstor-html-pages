        <pre>['53INTERNATIONAL PSYCHIATRY  VOLUME 11  NUMBER 3  AUGUST 2014\nGUEST  \nEDITORIAL Prisoner mental health in the USA\nNigel Bark\nAssociate Professor of Clinical \nPsychiatry, Bronx Psychiatric \nCenter, Bronx, New York, USA, \nemail nigel.bark@omh.ny.gov\nThe mental health of prisoners in the USA \nis affected by American history: Dorothea \nDix’s 1830s campaign; the Civil War and \nslavery; presidential interventions; the Great \nDepression; and the introduction of Medicaid \nand the Affordable Care Act. In 1934, the ratio \nof prisoners to mental hospital patients was \n0.4; now, it is 3:1, with states varying from 10:1 \nto 1:1. Those states with the highest ratios \nalso have the highest rates of imprisonment \nand the lowest expenditures on mental health. \nLitigation is likely to improve mental health \nservices in prisons and to keep people who are \nmentally ill out of prisons.\nSeveral strands of American history have contributed\nto the current mental health status of \nprisoners in the USA:\n• from Dorothea Dix’s 1830s campaign to improve \nthe plight of people with severe mental illness \nby building state hospitals, to deinstitutionalisation\nwithout adequate community services \n• from slavery and the Civil War, to the invalidation\nof the Voting Rights Act and racism, with \ndisparity and racial differences persisting\n• from a penal culture that promoted rehabilitation\n(before the 1970s), to one that emphasised \nmandatory sentencing and punishment, then to \na recent realisation that this is inappropriate\n• from President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal \nwith ‘the test … is whether we provide enough \nfor those who have too little’, to President Ronald \nReagan’s ‘We’re the party that wants to see an \nAmerica in which people can still get rich’ and \nthe rise in the appeal of ‘small govern ment’\n• from Medicare and Medicaid, introduced in the \n1960s, to provide healthcare for people who are \nelderly, poor or mentally ill, to the Affordable \nCare Act (ACA) of 2010, which increases Medicaid\nas well as insurance\n• from De Tocqueville’s 19th-century observation \nthat ‘sooner or later in the United States every \ncontroversy ends up in court’, to litigation to \nimprove mental health services in prisons \n• from the civil rights of those who are mentally \nill being largely ignored until the 1960s, when \n‘civil rights’ legislation and case law dangerously\nlimited involuntary hospitalisation, to \ncourt- ordered out-patient treatment and mental \nhealth courts. \nIncreasing and unequal prison \nincarceration\nThe USA has the highest rate of incarceration in \nthe world: one of every 100 adults, a 600% increase \nin 40 years (Baillargeon et al, 2009; Rich et al, \n2011; see also the website of the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics, http://www.bjs.gov, for statistics here and \nbelow). This rate is, though, at last decreasing, as \nmandatory sentencing laws (introduced during \nthe ‘crack’ epidemic and a time of rising crime \nrates) are being repealed (Rich et al, 2011). Black \nmen are disproportionately likely to be in prison: \n9% of all African Americans are behind bars or on \nprobation or parole, compared with only 3.7% of \nHispanics and 2.2% of Caucasians (Baillargeon \net al, 2009). In Michigan, half the prisoners are \nBlack while the population is 14% Black. African \nAmericans average 23% of the population in the \nten states with the highest rates of incarceration. \nThese include seven of the nine states that were \ncovered by the Voting Rights Act until it was invalidated\nby the Supreme Court, which will make \nvoting harder for the poor, minorities and people \nwho are mentally ill.\nPrisons are where those tried and sentenced to \nmore than a year are housed. Jails are for those \narrested, awaiting court appearance or sentenced \nto less than a year. The states are responsible \nfor prisons and the mental health of prisoners, \nalthough some states (such as Louisiana) have \nprivate for-profit prisons and some (such as South \nCarolina) neglect and abuse such prisoners, despite \ncourt orders (Cohen, 2014). Jails are administered \nby cities and counties. \nThe overall proportion of the population with \nmental disorders in correctional facilities and \nhospitals together is about the same as 50 years \nago. Then, however, 75% of that population were \nin mental hospitals and 25% incarcerated; now, \nit is 5% in mental hospitals and 95% incarcerated\n( Gilligan & Lee, 2013). In 1934, the ratio \nof prisoners to mental hospital patients was 0.4 \n(Penrose, 1943); now, it is 3:1, with states varying \nfrom 10:1 to 1:1 (Torrey et al, 2010). Those states \nwith the highest ratios – mainly the same states as \nin 1934, as reported by Penrose (1943) – also have \nthe highest rates of imprisonment (and of murder, \ngun deaths, poverty and teenage pregnancy – and \nthey vote Republican) and lowest expenditures on \nmental health (Torrey et al, 2010). The average expenditure\non mental health of the ten states with \nthe highest rates of incarceration is $75 per person \nand of the ten with the lowest is $143 (according to \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation, http://kff.org). But \nin the current recession, $1.6 billion has been cut \n', '54 INTERNATIONAL PSYCHIATRY  VOLUME 11  NUMBER 3  AUGUST  2014\nfrom state mental health budgets, federal Medicaid\n(which covers 46% of state mental health costs) \nhas been reduced (National Alliance on Mental \nIllness, 2011) and counties, which pay about 16% \nof Medicaid costs from property taxes, are also \ncutting back: Rockland County, where the author \nlives, has decimated its once model services and \nhas just closed its in-patient unit, which will probably\nincrease the numbers of people with a mental \nillness in jails.\nPrisoners who are mentally ill \nOnce incarcerated, half of inmates are found to \nhave a psychiatric disorder and 15–20% a serious \nmental illness (Torrey et al, 2010). In the 1930s, \nonly 1.5% of 9958 prisoners in New York City had \na psychosis (Bromberg & Thompson, 1937). Now, \nNew York City’s jail, Riker’s Island, with 12 000 \ninmates, has 40% with a psychiatric diagnosis, and \na third of those have major mental illnesses (Gilligan\n& Lee, 2013). A recent good diagnostic study \nfound 14% of males and 31% of females in jails had \na serious mental illness (Steadman et al, 2009), \nalthough a meta-analysis of good prison studies \nfound no increase in psychosis (rate about 3.5%) \nfrom 1966 to 2010 but an increase in depression \n(about 11%) (Fazel & Seewald, 2012). Black men \nhave higher rates of serious mental illness and \nmuch higher rates of court-ordered out-patient \ntreatment (Swanson et al, 2009). Prisoners with a \nmental illness are more likely than other prisoners \nto have: violated prison rules (58% v. 43%), been \nassaulted (24% v. 14%), been injured in a prison \nfight (20% v. 10%), been in solitary confinement \n(American Civil Liberties Union, 2009) and had \nmultiple incarcerations. And they cost more: $180 \nper day against $80 per day (Torrey et al, 2010). \nIn 2011, 34% of state prisoners, 24% of federal \nprisoners and 17% of jail inmates received mental \nhealth treatment. In 2000, of the 1558 state public \nand private adult correctional facilities, 1394 \nprovided mental health services: 70% screened \ninmates, 65% conducted psychiatric assessments, \n51% provided 24-hour mental healthcare, 71% \nprovided therapy or counselling, 73% provided \npsychotropic medications and 66% helped released \ninmates obtain community mental health services. \nStates vary in the provision of treatment: \ntherapy is provided for 2.7% to 37% of prisoners; \nmedication for 1.1% to 39%. Those states that \nprovide the least are among the ten states with the \nhighest rates of incarceration. In a Michigan study, \n17% of prisoners were receiving treatment (100% \ntherapy, 95% medication), but 65% of those with \na serious diagnosis (13% of all prisoners) were not \nbeing treated (Swanson et al, 2009).\nIn New York prisons, services consist of ‘outpatient’\nclinics, day programmes, hospital units \nwithin the prison and a forensic hospital. In Riker’s \nIsland jail, a private company provides the services \nfor New York City and two city hospitals have \nprison wards. All inmates have a medical ex amination\nwithin 24 hours of admission and a mental \nhealth assessment within 72 hours. In Texas, all \ninmates have an hour-long medical and psy chi atric \nex amin ation, and 20% are referred for further \npsychiatric evaluation (Baillargeon et al, 2009). \nThe law and access to treatment\nFederal laws mandating treatment of prisoners \nwith mental illness apply only to federal prisons. \nThe Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution \nforbids ‘cruel and unusual punishment’, which the \ncourts have interpreted as including ‘deliberate \nindifference to serious medical needs’ (American \nCivil Liberties Union, 2009). This has been used \nto force states (where state law is inadequate) to \nprovide appropriate services: in Massachusetts \nresulting in a dramatic reduction in rioting, \nmurders, suicides, rape and injuries in prison; in \nCalifornia resulting in a judge having oversight of \nthe treatment of incarcerated people with serious \nmental illness.\nLitigation usually results in ‘consent decrees’, \nwhere the states agree to a set of conditions and \nthe courts monitor them. They are in effect in \nmost states. For example, in Mississippi, where \n1000 men were held in solitary confinement in a \nsuper-maximum-security unit, a consent decree \nexcluded from that unit all those who had a severe \nmental illness and introduced mental health \nworkers, which resulted in a 70% decrease in \nserious incidents (American Civil Liberties Union, \n2009). In New York in response to a law suit (and \nsome tragic deaths) the state agreed to end all \nsolitary confinement for those who were young \nor pregnant, or who had an intellectual disability \nor mental illness. Yet in the USA there were still \n80 000 prisoners (disproportionately mentally ill) \nin solitary confinement in July 2013. \nAnother major source of concern and litigation \nis suicide, which occurs much more in prisons and \njails and is the leading cause of death: 41 per year \nper 100 000 inmates in the decade to 2011 (12 per \n100 000 in the general population).\nDiversion from incarceration\nStates with high and low rates of imprisonment, \nrecognising that the rights and dignity of people \nwith a mental disorder are compromised, share \ninitiatives aimed at reducing their incarceration. \nForty-seven states have police crisis intervention \nteams that work to avoid the arrest of people who \nare mentally ill (Aron et al, 2009). Additionally, \nmental health courts (200 of them, in 43 states) \nand drug courts (2600) divert the arrested person \nto psychiatric treatment (Aron et al, 2009). A \nreview of these ‘criminal justice liaison and diversion’\nservices found they were beneficial (Scott et \nal, 2013). ‘Assisted out-patient treatment’ (courtordered\ntreatment, usually at hospital or on prison \ndischarge) significantly reduces rates of arrest and \nincarceration (Torrey et al, 2010) and can halve \ntotal costs in the first year (Swanson et al, 2013). \nAdverse outcomes\nReleased prisoners are 129 times more likely to die \nfrom drug overdose and 12 times more likely to \n', '55INTERNATIONAL PSYCHIATRY  VOLUME 11  NUMBER 3  AUGUST 2014\ndie from any cause in the first 2 weeks (Rich et al, \n2011). In New York, a charitable organisation helps \n1000 offenders with mental illness released from \nRiker’s Island every year. The Affordable Care Act, \nthrough a Medicaid mandate, will help released \nprisoners throughout the country get services \n(Rich et al, 2011), although many states, mainly the \npoorest and those with high imprisonment rates, \nare resisting participation under the Act, aided \nby attack advertisements paid for by very wealthy \noutsiders.\nConclusion\nThe historical strands, interacting with the tension \nbetween federal laws and regulations, states’ rights \nand the Constitution, and enormously variable and \nhighly polarised views, have resulted in great variation\nin incarceration rates and prisoner mental \nhealth across the USA. Overall, there are signs of \nimprovement, with decreasing numbers in prison, \nbut there are still far too many people with mental \nillness in jail and prison. Litigation and concern \nfor the most vulnerable have helped ensure better \ntreatment in jails and prisons but the high suicide \nrate shows that it remains inadequate. In this time \nof economic difficulty, funds for community services\nare being cut back, which will only increase \nthe incarceration of people who are mentally ill. \nPsychiatrists and other mental health professionals \nmust give high priority to campaigning to persuade\nthe public and the politicians that it is right \nand moral to provide appropriate treatment and \nservices for everyone who is mentally ill, irrespective\nof where they find themselves. Any resulting \nreduction in imprisonment, hospitalisation and \ncosts is a bonus.\nReferences\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) (2009) Human Rights at \nHome: Mental Illness in US Prisons and Jails.
