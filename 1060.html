A sharp rise in environmentalism has emerged in\nthe US and Western Europe. A positive change within consumer behavior towards environmentally\nrelated products can be seen due to the increased level of environmental awareness since the 1970s.1\nThis change contributed to the start of the green revolution to prevent further damage to the\nenvironment. Indeed green marketing is a type of marketing that aims to reduce our affects on the\nenvironment by design, produce, packaging, labeling and consumption.2\nGreen marketing has concentrated on product (packaging and labeling) and incentive strategies in\nrecent years. Assessing universal incentives to be green are necessary because it can show us how\ngreen marketing in all organizational activities can be carried out.2\nCompanies apply a strategic approach to environmental and entrepreneurial parts of industry to\ncreate the possibility of modifying consumer satisfaction through new and green products. This can\nalso create a competitive advantage and reduces the pressure of competition.2\nPurchasing behavior generally consists of five parts: the discovery of the need to seek solutions,\nevaluate solutions, decision to purchase and post-purchase behavior. Factors such as socio-cultural,\npsychological-individual, marketing and mixed situations, all influence consumer purchasing behavior.\nOrganizations and consumers should have a responsibility towards environmental issues and by the\npurchasing of green products they participate in this process. Although the reasons to participate in\ngreen activities and their commitment to the environment is different, the green consumer has a vital\nrole in helping the environment.3 Generally, these consumers will not buy products that endanger\nhuman health, have associated risk during the production process, cause any serious damage to the\nenvironment, inflict serious damage to the environment during the production process, produce excess\nwaste, are involved in the extraction of raw materials, damage endangered plant and animal species\nand/or a natural resource.4\nApplying these policies plays an essential role in switching consumer purchasing behavior to buy\nenvironmentally friendly products, therefore, reducing the negative impact of synthetic products on the\nenvironment, however the findings often contradict each other. Therefore, research may only be\nrelevant in certain cultural, time and geographical contexts.2\nCertain studies have investigated the change in consumer’s behavior, where those who worry about\nthe environment will indicate their concerns through different behaviors, such as checking the products\nthey will purchase to ensure they are buying ethically.5\nIn this study the effects of green marketing tools on consumer purchasing behavior were examined.\nA REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH LITERATURE\nMany investigations have looked into how we can help to protect the environment. There is a\nsignificant relationship between demographic characteristics, cognitive psychology, personality and\nattitude and activities that help to protect the environment.6\nPickett et al.,7 evaluated the effect of these factors, the results showed that the influence of\npsychological and social factors are more powerful than demographic factors on consumer’s green\nbehavior. In addition, they believe that by affecting these factors, people show different behavior, and\ntherefore have a positive effect on developing marketing strategies.7\nMoreover, another study assessed environmental knowledge as one of the effective variables on\ngreen consumer behavior. Creating concern in relation to environmental issues is the role of\n‘knowledge’ in green marketing. Knowledge and awareness about the environment are directly related\nto a person’s intended purchasing. People who have more knowledge than others in this field, who\nshow concern for the environment, could process the information related to environmentally friendly\nproducts.8\nMarketing experts need to focus on environmental knowledge in organizations, and advertise their\nproducts in order to achieve their objectives, such as consumer purchase behavior.9\n1. GREEN MARKETING\nMarketing means ‘working in the market’, with the aim that completing transactions will satisfy the\nneeds and desires of a human being. Green marketing is currently not achieving its potential for\nimproving the quality of life of consumers, whilst improving the natural ectosystem.10\nPage 2 of 9\nDelafrooz et al. QScience Connect 2014:5\n', 'Green marketing has substantial coverage within the media. It seems that many personal and\nindustrial consumers are more conscious about the environment and increasingly interested in\nits preservation.2\nThe American Marketing Association workshop attempted to bring together academics, practitioners,\nand public policy makers to examine marketing’s impact on the natural environment. At this workshop\necological marketing was defined as: the study of the positive and negative aspects of marketing\nactivities on pollution, energy depletion and non-energy resource depletion.11\nGreen marketing has passed different stages during the course of its development. Each stage has\nspecific characteristics and changing situational and environmental needs.12\nGreen marketing has passed three eras, the first, ecological green marketing, lasted from the 1960s\ninto the early 1970s. Characteristics of this era concentrated on external problems of the environment,\nsuch as air pollution.13 The second era, green environmental marketing, this process began in the late\n80s and it consisted of new concepts, such as clean technology, sustainability, consumer and\ncompetitive advantage emerged. The significant difference between the first and second eras was that\nthe first era was focused on effective industries on the environment, but the second era, environmental\nmarketing, included all services and manufacturing methods, such as tourism.13\nThe third era is sustainable green marketing. With increasing demands and expectations of people\nand strict rules of state the second era was not able to continue. Sustainable development, in the area\nof marketing science, made a great impact on the economy.12\nThe Toyota factory created “environmental technology”. Their perspective was shaped, not only by\nlaws, but also the pressure to form a unified product line, for example to produce the next generation of\ncars as electric–combustion hybrids. The results show that Toyota is now the leader in this segment of\nthe market, and this section has grown significantly in recent years.\nThe modern environmental movement in America began in the late 1960’s and was recognized as\nbeing a leader in the environmental statement. At that time European countries reconstructed the\neconomic devastation caused by the Second World War.14\nThe ecological movement in America started during the 1960s and increased in public awareness\nand concern, in the context of this the Environmental Quality Council (CEQ) and Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) were created in the 1970s, and several environmental laws were passed during\nthe 1970s.15 In addition, ethical consumers noted that 5% of the world’s population uses 30% of the\nworld resources. Over the years, environmental regulations were slowly integrated. Finally, concern for\nthe environment began in West Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, however, this is a relatively\nrecent development for many countries.16\nIn the late 1970s, the “Green party” was created in Germany. This organization included elected\nmembers of political offices in Europe, as a result it was the main drive behind forming the “Green\nRevolution”. Nowadays, the environment is the major issue in many European countries (e.g. Britain\nand Italy) that before was faced with some reluctance from the population.2\nAccording to Ottman17,18 and Peattie19 demand and attitudes for green products is likely to be\nuneven across market segments and cultures. Consequently, research on the effect of green marketing\ntools on purchase behavior in emerging Asian markets is considered to be well-timed.2\nAccording to Chan,20 the reasons for the lack of attention are the inadequate green products and\nservices in the market. Although this argument is somewhat true in the consumer society, in Iran, green\nfood products, light bulbs or CFC-free spray are frequently found. The first step, ‘buying’ them, shows\nthe consumer interest in environmental issues, and the next step has reflected this approach in the\nbuying behavior.\nHence, it can be said that the purchasing behavior of consumers influenced varies and the intensity\nof the effect is can be different. For instance, in a recession, the economic issues are so important that\nother issues, such as the environment, are ignored.21\n2. GREEN MARKETING TOOLS\nGreen marketing tools, such as eco-label, eco-brand and environmental advertisement, will\nmake perception easier and increase awareness of green products attributes and characteristics.\nThe consequence of this will guide consumers into purchasing environmentally friendly products.\nApplying these policy tools plays an essential role in altering consumer purchasing behavior to buy\nenvironmental friendly products, therefore, reducing the negative impact of synthetic products on\nthe environment.2\nPage 3 of 9\nDelafrooz et al. QScience Connect 2014:5\n', 'According to Hartmann and Ibáñez22 green marketing generally focuses on the efficiency of cognitive\npersuasion strategies, and believes that the consumer’s high involvement concerning environmental\nissues is an affect of growing environmental knowledge.\nStanton and Futrell23 define green or environmental marketing as ‘actions intended to replace\ncurrent needs and wants with minimal harmful impact on our environment’.\nGinsberg and Bloom24 claim that there is no single marketing tool that would be appropriate for all\nfirms. Rather, strategies should be different based on different markets and the degree of consumer\nconcern on the environment.\nStudying the determinants of consumers’ green purchase behavior would be beneficial for green\nmarketers, although our focus is on the influence of green marketing tools on purchase behavior.\nThe majority of these studies have been conducted in industrialized countries.20,25–27\nIn the following we will review each of the green marketing tools.\n2.1. Eco-labeling\nOne of the significant green marketing tools used is the eco-label on environmentally friendly products.\nEnvironmental labels are used by marketing to promote the identification of green products.28\nLabels consist of a range of small pieces of paper, up to very complex diagrams that are included as\na part of the goods packaging. Labels can contain simply the brand products or a range of varied\ninformation. In some cases, the seller may want a simple ‘Label’, but law obliges them to provide\nadditional information.29\nSammer and Wüstenhagen30, identify the eco-label as an important tool to allocated asymmetry\ninformation between sellers and buyers. They also state that labels are a signal to accomplish two main\nfunctions for consumers: an information function that informs them about intangible product\ncharacteristics, such as product quality and a value function, which provides a value in themselves\n(e.g. prestige).\nRex and Baumann31 define eco-labels as a tool for consumers to facilitate making a decision to select\nenvironmentally-friendly products, it also enables them to know how products are made.\nMany of the studies on eco-labels look for ways to make them effective in consumers’ purchase\nbehavior and environmentally safe products.28,30 Sometimes consumer distrust of eco-labels can be\nexpressed through their ignorance in identifying eco-labels and the regulations that companies follow\nto place authorized labels on their products.32\nNik Abdul Rashid’s33 study, has shown that awareness of eco-label has a positive effect between the\nknowledge of a green product and consumer’s intention to purchase. However, other studies indicate\nthat although the functions of labels are recognized by some consumers, this does not automatically\nlead them to green purchasing decisions.34\nFew studies have investigated the link between environmental labeling and a consumer’s intention\nand behavior to purchase environmentally friendly products.33,35,36 In addition,35 explains that little is\nunderstood about the effect of label information on a consumer’s intention to purchase environmental\nfriendly products.\nKuhn37 illustrates that these situations will emerge from growth in pollution from enlarging the\nmarket as a result of achieving greater market share through manufactured environmental friendly\nproducts.\n2.2. Eco-brand\nThe American Marketing Association define a brand as “a name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or the\ncombination of them, intended to identify the goods or services of one seller or group of sellers and to\ndifferentiate them from those of a competitor.” This definition can be generalized for the eco-brand as\nwell. Eco-brand is a name, symbol or design of products that are harmless to the environment. Utilizing\neco-brand features can help consumers to differentiate them in some way from other non-green\nproducts.2)\nAccording to a prior study by Rahbar and Abdul Wahid38, Malaysian consumers consider glass\nbased, household cleaning, aerosols, pesticides and plastics as non-green product categories, with a\nhigh level of impact on the environment. Hence, it can be predicted that consumers will respond\npositively to products with environmental features, known as ‘eco-branded’ products. Earlier research\nin western countries supports the idea that consumers in the USA and Germany take positive action to\neco-branded products, such as the Body Shop and green energy.39\nPage 4 of 9\nDelafrooz et al. QScience Connect 2014:5\n', 'The significant factor motivating consumers to change actual purchase behavior to buy eco-friendly\nproducts is emotional brand benefits.40 Hartmann et al.40 list different types of emotional brand\nbenefits as: a feeling of well-being, auto-expression benefits through the socially visible consumption\nand nature-related benefits.\nKnowing about consumers’ brand purchase decisions are very important for marketers and market\nresearchers. This effect is known as brand equity. Brand equity can be defined as data that has different\neffects on consumer response to the marketing. Green brands that generally focus on the environment\nshould be used to highlight the status of green products, in a similar way to non-green products.41\n2.3. Environmental advertisement\nIn the wake of increasing consumer concern about the environment, in the late 1980s and early 1990s,\ngreen marketing activities progressed, especially in the field of environmental advertising.42\nIn parallel with improving green movements worldwide and with increasing public attention to\nenvironmental problems, most organizations have chosen environmental advertisements through the\nmedia or newspapers, as a method of introducing their products to environmentally responsible\nconsumers. The objective of green advertisements was influencing consumers’ purchase behavior by\nencouraging them to buy products that do not harm the environment and direct their attention to the\npositive consequences of their purchase behavior.2\nDavis43 describes that environmental advertising by corporations usually contains three elements.\nFirst, the advertisement begins with a statement of corporate concern for the environment. Secondly,\nthe advertisement describes the way the corporation has changed its procedures in order to\ndemonstrate its concern and dedication to improving the environment. Thirdly, the advertisement\ndescribes specific environmental actions in which the corporation is involved, and/or results for which\nthe corporation takes credit.\nAccording to Baldwin,44 environmental advertisements help to form a consumer’s values and\ntranslate these values into the purchase of green products.2\nAs stated by Chase and Smith,45 ‘Environmental messages in advertisements and product labeling\nwas found to “sometimes” influence the purchasing decisions of 70% of respondents.2\n3. CONSUMER PURCHASE BEHAVIOR\nComprehending this point is of high significance, that consumers can affect the environment as the\nenvironment itself can influence consumers. Therefore, changes in the cost of pattern/model or the\nsaving of consumers can affect the economy.46\nConsumer purchasing behavior is defined as: final consumer behavior during the purchase. There are\nfour types of purchase behavior: Complex purchase behavior, those purchasing behaviors that seek\nvariety, purchasing behavior that seeks to reduce tensions after purchase and normal purchasing\nbehavior.29\nNumerous estimations indicate that consumers take the environment seriously, but generally\nnothing is seen or observed in their acts, for example, in purchasing the environmentally-friendly\nproducts.47\nConsumer behavior perception and “knowing customers” is not so simple. Sometimes customers\nexpress their needs and desires, but do so in different ways. They may be unaware of their inner\nmotivations or react to the affecting factors and at the last moment will change their opinion.\nNevertheless, members of marketing should survey their customer needs, their receiving subjective,\ntheir buying and purchasing behavior.48\nGreen marketing activities are increasing in many countries, and these activities have had an\nimportant influence on increasing consumer knowledge and in shifting consumers into purchasing\ngreen products.49 The ‘greenness’ can be due to outer or inner pressure.50\nThus, in this study we have a main hypothesis and three sub-hypotheses that are as follows:\nThe main hypothesis: A significant and positive relationship exists between green marketing tools\nand customer’s purchase behavior.\nSub-H1: A significant and positive relationship exists between eco-label and customer’s purchase\nbehavior.\nSub-H2: A significant and positive relationship exists between eco-brand and customer’s purchase\nbehavior.\nPage 5 of 9\nDelafrooz et al. QScience Connect 2014:5\n', 'Sub-H3: A significant and positive relationship exists between environmental advertisement and\ncustomer’s purchase behavior.\nMETHOD\nOur research study sought to examine the impact of green marketing tools on consumer purchasing\nbehavior, by using analytical model investigation, a questionnaire and regression analysis. This is an\napplied research, we aim to solve existing problems within organizations. The study is also commercial\nand the results aim to improve the process of providing a product or a particular method of product.\nThe number of samples is obtained as follows:\nn ¼\nz 212/=2 £ p £ q\ne2\n¼\nð1:96Þ2ð0:5 £ 0:5Þ\nð0:05Þ2\n¼ 384\nz ¼ Standardized value corresponding to the confidence level\np ¼ Estimating observed attribute variable in the community\nq ¼ Estimation of different objects that are not observed\ne ¼ Allowable error in the measurement range of observations\nThe society sampling in access includes the information aggregation of a society members that is\nsimply accessible for achieving its information (Sekaran, translated by Saebi and Shirazi, 2012).\nThe method of sampling is cluster sampling. Tehran is divided into four areas, North, South, East and\nWest, and we chose the northern and western areas. The questionnaires were distributed in chain\nstores in these areas. Minimum specimen volume is 384 people, at 95% reliability.\nThe data was collected using a questionnaire. These were collected from customers in chain stores in\nthe Northern and Western parts of Tehran. We use closed questions with five options on a Likert scale.\nThe responses range from, strongly disagree to strongly agree, and were set so as to help individuals\nquickly select one option. Thus, researchers can easily extract and analyse the information. There are\ntwo variables in this study. Each of the hypotheses listed factors that are considered as independent\nvariables (green marketing tools). Consumer purchasing behavior is chosen as the dependent variable,\nsee table 1. All these variables were used in the formulation of the questionnaire.\nIf the questions related to the measuring tools, are the representative of attributes and particular\nskills that aim to measure them, the test has reliability for content.51\nThe questionnaire is composed of five sections. The first part focused on the demographic\ncharacteristics of respondents. Perception towards environmental advertising was measured in the\nsecond part of the questionnaire, following the Chan20 study. Four items, measuring the perceived\nimpact of environmental advertisement on consumer’s actual purchasing behavior, were used on a\nfive-point Likert scale (1 ¼ strongly disagree, 5 ¼ strongly agree).\nThe third part measures perception of eco-label of green marketing tools as a guide to consumers to\nfor recognizing environmentally-friendly products. It was adapted from Nik Abdul Rashid,52 the original\nstudy consisted of three components to evaluate consumer’s cognitive behavior towards the eco-label.\nThe three components are: awareness, knowledge and trust.\nThe fourth part of the questionnaire was designed to measure the impact of eco-brand on consumer\npurchase behavior. The last part of the questionnaire includes purchase behavior as the dependant\nvariable. In this study, the variable is measured by the level of the priority given when respondents\ndecide on their actual product purchase of green products with ecological features, versus non-green\nproducts.\nTable 1.

QScience Connect 2014:5\n', 'The display of both group A and group B products, were followed by related statements on consumer\npurchase behavior. The researchers have closely followed Nik Abdul Rashid’s method, but the two\ngroups of products were created following Yam-Tang and Chan’s study53 and classification of\nenvironmentally sensitive products. Statistical techniques were used to process the data included,\nnamely Spearman correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis.\nFollowing data collection and getting a sufficient response rate, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients\nfor each tool was computed. All values indicated the reliability of the instruments. There were two\ncontrol questions in the eco-brand and eco-label, but in final analysis these were excluded.\nIn this study, according to similar questions, each variable was designed. Moreover, experts\nregarding questionnaire, advised on appropriate recommendations.\nRESULTS\nGenerally, it is not possible that one method always outperforms all other methods in every situation.\nThis usually depends on the characteristics of the training patterns and unfortunately it is difficult\nto know in advance exactly which technique or algorithm is best for the problem at hand.54\nDescriptive statistics examined demographic variables are presented in Table 2.\nMultivariate regression analysis, see table 3, indicates that the green marketing tools as variables,\npredict the amounts of variance in purchasing behavior. Standardized beta values for each variable are\npresented in Table 3, and the importance of each predictor variable has been interpreted.\nCONCLUSION\nCorrelation test results show that the correlation coefficient values predicted by the model, green\nmarketing tools is equal to 0/814. The square of the correlation coefficient is equal to 0/663. This\nsuggests that green marketing tools predicted 66/3% of the variance change in customer purchasing\nbehavior. The results of the multivariate regression model revealed that the environmental\nadvertisement has the largest share in predicting purchasing behavior (Beta:0/6). The eco-labeling\nvariable is next (Beta:0/24), and eco-brand shows the least impact on forecasting purchasing behavior.\nThe first hypothesis examined the relationship between green marketing tools and customer\npurchasing behavior, and shows that environmental advertising has the largest effect on purchasing\nTable 2.

Recommendations offered in this field should continue to\ninform the public on environmental matters, for example, how to keep it safe, and provide a continued\nawareness of products that do less harm to the environment.\nThis is a new phenomenon in our country, which is required for training, information, building culture\nand new technologies. We need public officials, people and producers to assist in this area, to help\neach other move towards a healthy production and cleaner future. In addition, environmental products\nshould come with more advertising, increased variety and lower prices so to be fully appreciated.\nThe second hypothesis, examined the relationship between eco-label and customer purchase\nbehavior. The conclusion is that we must use trained graphic artists that specialize in this area to\ndesign better eco-labels. With the increased awareness on eco-labels, it would help in promoting green\nproduct consumption among consumers. However, government should monitor the credibility and\ntrustworthiness of messages in eco-labels. Government should endeavor to inform citizens about the\nmeaning and availability of the new eco-labels and eco-brands, and the benefits of using eco-labeled\nand eco-branded products on environment.55\nThe third hypothesis examined the relationship that exists between eco-brand and customer\npurchase behavior. Eco-brand is a new topic and has an impact on purchasing behavior. More\ninvestigations into the ‘eco-brand’ are needed. Information and articles on this topic are scarce, and it\nis also one of the limitations of this research. We hope that other researchers will investigate this area\nin the future.\nThe fourth hypothesis, examined the relationship that exists between environmental advertisement\nand customer purchase behavior. It has been shown that advertising has the greatest effect on\nconsumer purchasing behavior, as a result we can utilize this opportunity to increase familiarity with\nenvironmental products today.\nOne of the factors contributing to the failure of applying environmental advertisements to enhance\npurchase behavior is due to the low credibility of green advertisements among consumers.56\nWhitson and Henry36 note that only a few studies (eg. Nik Abdul Rashid28; D’Souza et al.35;\nD’Souza52) have been done on consumer purchase behavior and environmental labeling.\nNot all consumers are strongly influenced by green marketing. Thus, there is a need to identify and\nconcentrate promotion of goods on those market targets that are environmentally concerned. These\nsegments tend to be younger and more affluent members of the population.57\nSUGGESTIONS\nThere are some recommendations for future studies in this area. First, other green marketing tools can be\nexamined. Any discussion of gender differences can also be considered. The confidence of the eco-brand\nand eco-label can be worked on. The novelty of this study is the ‘feeling’ towards the health benefits of a\nbrand. People buy products that are less damaging to the environment so that they feel better.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Alwitt LF, Pitts RE. Predicting purchase intentions for an environmentally sensitive product.
