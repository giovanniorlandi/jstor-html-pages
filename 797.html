At this writing, Mr. Morrow, Re\npublican candidate for Governor of\nthe State of Kentucky, has refused\nto give his views in regard to the\nratification of the Peace Treaty and\nthe League of Nations. Governoi\nBlack has called upon Mr. Morrow\ntime after time to give his views\nthe press of the State has repeatedly\nrequested that Mr. Morrow express\nhimself but the cry has been un-.\nheeded and the people of the State\nare in ignorance as\'to Mr. Morrow\'s\nattitude on these important ques\ntions. Mr. Morow has tried to crawl\nbehind the excuse that the ratifica\ntion of the Peace Treaty" and the\nLeague of Nations are" national ques\ntions, and- therefore have\' nothing to\ndo with State affairs.\nThese questions, are national \'ques\ntions, but they are also State "ques\ntions, because ( each Mate is an in\ntegral part of the nation: and further\nthey axe LOCAL QUESTIONS.\nKentucky is a great tobacco rais\nI -Jr? " State; Christian county is a\ngreat tobacco county raising as\nmuch if not more black tobacco than\nany other county in the world. The\nbulk of this tobacco is for export\nBefore the war, a large part of this\ntobacco was bought for German and\nAustrian firms.\nThe writer has just rteured from\na sojourn of several month? in\' the\ninterior of Germany, and during that\ntime he visitedparts of Austria. To\nbacco is one of the scarcest articles\nin tlese countries. The people crave\ntobjo and, are willing to pay any\nprice tor it. They have done with\nout it for aperiod of four years and\nnow they want Tt at any cost. But\nforeign trade with these countries\ncannot be firmly established until\nour Senate ratifies the Peace treaty.\nA group of Republican, Senators\nare holding up, and obstructing in\nevery possible way the ratification of\npeace with Germany. They are\nplaying politics while other nations\nare grabbing the foreign trade. This\ndelay is costing the people of the\nUnited States millions of dollars. The\nremainder of the world is waiting to\nsee what the United States is going\nto do. Foreign exchange is uncer\ntain, and the enemy nations canrtot\nestablish credits until a peace is rati\nfied. We have no vtrade with Ger\nmany or Austria. We have no rep\nresentative on the. Inter-allied Com\nmission which says what, how much,\naryl where Germany and Austria\nshall buy.\nI have talked to a number of to\nbacco men, and they have all said\nthe same thing that if the Peace\nTreaty had been ratified a month a"go\nor ifit were ratified today that the\n. prte of this year\'s crop of tobacco\nwould be FIVE DOLLARS PER\nHUNDRED HIGHER.\n, And yet, Mr. Morrow, states that\nthis is a national question and has\nnothing to do with State or local\nj fairs.\nIt appears to us a highly important\nlocal issue. The dilatory methods,\nand the political maneuverings of the\nRepublican Senators in regard to the\nratification of . the Peace \'Treaty\nl-,ve cost the farmers of Christian\nYounty over - MILLION DOLLARS\non tobacco alone. . .\nChristian county and "the remain\nder of thj "Black Patch" differ ma\nterktlJy .with Mr. \'Morrow in regard\nto this not being a local issue. They\nThe first run off in the contest for\nCity Commissioners will be held to\nday at the Usual voting precincts in\nthe city of Hopkinsville. There \'are\nfour candidates to be chosen to be\nvoted .for in the regular"\' November\nelection, two of the four to be elect\ned. . ; -\nThe primary is non-partisan with\nfive entries, only one of whom will\nbe dropped in today\'s voting. The\nlist with their known political com\nplexion is as follows:\nCommissioner R. T. Stowe, Dem.\nCity Clerk Jno. W. Richards, Dem\nCapt. Ben S. Winfree, Dem.\nFormer Sheriff H. II. Golay, Rep.\nFormer Councilman J. Sol Fritz;\nRep. .\nThe names will be arranged on a\nsingle ballot, alphabetically, and\nchange the order with every fifty of\nthe ballots. There will be no device\nor other means of designating the\ncandidates, as the voters will select\n4 of the 5 to stamp opposite their\nnames. \'\nVery little interest is being taken\nin the primary. The people general\nly are not pleased with the Commis\nsion form of government. A numer\nously signed petition to vote on the\nrepeal of the law was circulated last\nfall, but it was found that such a\nvote could, not be taken until after\nJanuary 1, 1920. ; -\nThere is no mayor to be elected\nthis time."" Mayor -Frank H. Eassett.\nwho was elected in 1917, holding ov\ner, for two more years.\nIn 1917 Judge Hunter Wood, Jr.\nwas elected for two years as police\njudge, the law providing that anoth\ner election .would .be held this year\nfor a fourryears\' term. Judge Wood,\nhowever, set us a claim that the con\nstitution fixed the term of police\njudge at 4 \'years and he was there\nfore entitled td serve \', till 1921.\nProspective candidates for the office\nabandoned their plans to run ,and\nthe matter was accepted without a\nlegal test and no \'election will be\nheld for police judge..\nIn the Commissioners\' races it\' is\nimpossible to predict wiiicii canui-\ndates will develop, the most strength".\nIn the last contest, two candidates\nran so far in the lead that the others\nconsidering the contest settled with\ndrew and. there was no contest in\nNovember. It may be that the same\nconditions may result this time and\nthat today\'s voting may virtually\nsettle who will fill the offices. The\npositions pay $1,800, each - and it\nwill be a matter of agreement after\nelection which commissioner will be\nCommissioner of Finance and which\nCommissioner of Public Works.\nIf w r j ftr mi v I I N\nijmMiiL uJli MdoU4iiHlluiii\nJPKINSVILLE MADE THE HEADQUARTERS AND R.

Virtual notice\nwas given by members of the labor\ngroup that should the representa\ntives of capital succeed in their at\ntempt to send the resolution back to\nthe committee of fifteen, the labor\ndelegation would withdraw.\nThe collective bargaining resolu\ntion providing for an endorsement of\nthe right of wage earners to negoti\nate with employes through "represen\ntatives of . their own choosing" was\nreported to the conference, and it\nmet at 2:30 o\'clock this afternoon\nwith the approval of all of the pub\nlic and labor delegates in the com\nmittee, but opposed by the repre\nsentatives of capital.\nRealizing that the conference fac\ned the likelihood of dissolution un\nless an agreement could be reached\non the issue of collective bargaining\nmembers of the public group directed\neloquent appeals to the employers in\nan effort to win them over to the\nresolution.

Continuing, Dr. Mott paid\na glowing tribute to the hard work,\nunselfishness and sacrifices of Pres\nident Wilson. He spoke touchingly of ;\nI he adverse news from Washington\nconcerning the condition of the chief\nexecutive, and asked that he be spe\ncially remembered In the prayers of\nthe audience that "God would spare\nhim to tlie American people In a time\nwhen he Is so sorely needed."\n"I think If ne could be here tonight\nand hear your cheers he would be\nheartened," Dr. Mott said.\nAllies Want Y.

Tlie luncheon meeting for state sec\nretaries and district chairmen was\nwidely representative of Kentucky, ac\ncording to the word of State Y. M.

The quota of this city\nIn tlie coming campaign, $41,000, wns\nannounced. .\nThe luncheon was presided over by\nL. L. Anderson of Louisville, the presi\ndent of the State Y. M. C.

P.\nSummerall, Commander of the First\nDivision, the famous "Fighting First\nin France," and new commander of\nCamp Taylor, was the first speaker of\ntlie program and the first appearance\nyf the general as a speaker In Louis\nville. "I am no speaker," said General\nSummerall, "but anyone Is able to talk\ndii such a subject as the work of the\nY. M. C. A. In the war."\nGeneral Summerall spoke eloquently\non the great service the Y. M. C. A.\nrendered, and said In substance:\n"The crowning Inspiration of the\nY. SI. C.

Siott\'s address was one of\ntae most impressive discourses ever\ndelivered In Louisville. The distin\nguished American was Introduced by\nDr. K. Y. Slullins, president of the\nSouthern Baptist, Theological Sem\ninary, who. In presenting the guest of\nhonor, called uttentlon to the many\nconspicuous positions of, . leadership\nwhich Dr. Slott has occupied. Among\nthese were head of the Student Volun\nteer Slovement for years ; head of the\norganization of the International Y.\nM. C. A. ; head of the War Work\nCouncil of the Y. SI. C. A., and head\nof the Kdlnburgh Conference. "Though\na layman, Dr. Slott Is the outstanding\nreligious figure of the day, because the\nfire of his spiritual devotion burns so\nstrong and so bright in the midst of a\npractical life," concluded Dr. Muliins.\nDealing With a New World.\n"I remind you that you are dealimr\nwith a new world a. shaken, quiver-\'\nIng world a world in which pillars j\nthat were deemed pillars of strength\nand were pointed to with pride, have\ncrumbled to dust at our feet," said Dr.\nMott, after a brief preliminary which \'\nexplained that he had for the pa3t\nthirty-one years been "cruising" over \'\nthe world on missions of helpfulness in\nforty-six countries; that he had visited\nlite war zones of Uuropa six times\nduring the course of the world war\nand had traveled 7,000 miles on the\neastern front.\nContinuing, tlie speaker said: It is\nnn Impoverished world also, for up to\nsix months sgo it had cost over 200\nbillions of dollars; it is an exhausted\n.world both economically and vitally, i\nas demonstrated by the 11,000,000 1\n\' rrrautiB thnt- l.iivu Kaan flllafl hfrnnlA nf\nI1-""" "\nj tlie struggle; and it Is still a sorrow\n.

He declared that It Is a\n\'wonderful time to live when a whole\nJ world l accessible to new Ideas. Com\njparatlvely speaking, It Is an unselfish\nworld too, he said, for although it is\nnot so unseihsh as It was a year ago,\nor two years ago, it Is far more un\nselfish than before the war.\n"I had thought that I might see one\nof two nations plastic, but I never\nthought to see a whole world molten\nand plastic as Is the world today\nbut It will set, and set hard In a new\nmold, and this Is the golden oppor\ntunity of an organization like the Y.\nj SI.

Work.\n"I have been particularly Impressed\nwith the plans wmch have just beei\nlaid before you men of Kentucky. I\nm sure you cannot realize how far\nreaching this program may be. Be\ncause of this, I would like to say that\nby a peculiar circumstance, I have\nSeen able to get a larger view a set\nting as It were on the effect of just\nwhat such an enterprise may ac\ncomplish ; by reason of the fact that I\nnave traveledIn every country in the\nworld, have been associated with the\npeoples and leaders of so many na\n:lons, and,have watched the virus of\n3olshevlsm, which seeks to cleave the\nlations into class hatred, spread over\nEurope and the United States. I\nwould say that you can have no con\nception of the multiplying possibilities\n3f this program ; or of the healing pos\njibllltles of Its application. It Is a\npivotal campaign.

She wondered\nif Virginia\'s "hope chest" was really\nfilled to overflowing and if she had\nreally bought material for a wedding\ngown. She did not blame Kenneth if ,\nit were true, for Virginia was the\nprettiest and richest girl In the village.\nYet all the villagers knew and loved\nMary Ann, although it was quietly\nagreed that she was far from good\nlooking. Every one called her "Little\nSister" for she had always seemed like\na little sister to them all.\nMary Ann\'s frown soon changed into\na smile and she began to sing snatches\nof songs, for she could never scowl or\nsigh very long.

He\nknew how she had watched the papers\nwith great anxiety while he was in\nthe trenches, and how she had waited\nwith great anticipation and expecta\ntions for his home-coming.\nIt was no wonder that a deep flush\npassed over "Little Sister\'s" face when\nber father said teaslngly.

Her father was sick and\nshe dared not leave him alone.\nWhen the train whistled In the dis\ntance, the crowd of welcomers moved\nwith one accord nearer the tracks, and\nthe band began, its music. All eyes\nscanned the doors and windows of the\ntrain as it stopped and the travelers\nbegan to climb off.
