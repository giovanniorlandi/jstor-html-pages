This was the\nfirst intimation we had of the story,\nand it probably would never have\nbeen known -over here had not Mr.\nEdmonds advised the people. How\never, we never like to see a candidate\nstart into a campaign with "apolo\ngies." If he commences it he is\nyery likely to have to keep it up.\nLast Tuesday afternoon, Glen,\nthe eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Tom\nSheddan, met with an accident that\nmay prove fatal. He had entered a\nstall to feed a horse some barley and\nwas retiring when he slipped in\nsome manner and fell just behind\nthe horse\'s feet. The "animal being\nfreightened kicked and struck the\nlittle fellow on top of the head,\nfracturing his skull and somewhat\nbruising the brain. He got up and\nwalked away from the barn and sat\ndown at the windmill, calling to his\nfather and telling him that the horse\nhad kicked him. He was immedi\nately brought to the city where Drs\nFee and Dickerson dressed the\nwound which they pronounced very\ndangerous. The most remarkable\nfact is that the boy was conscious al\nthe time. At preseDt he is getting\nalong nicely at the home of Mr.\nRagland. It is earnestly hoped that\nMisses Hattie Rhodes and Dollie\nFollick were looking up school pros\npects for the latter on the Kiowa\nast week. ... Amy Gorman came\ndown from Meade Friday. . . . Our\nold friend Harry Reas was in town\nlast week. He has been located at\nMeade since leaving this place and\nrecently shipped a fine lot of steers\nto Kansas City.

Fearing that she was\ndemented, Mrs. Cartmel sent her\nson, Charlie, over to get Gene\nGroves and they brought the woman\nback to town. They took her to the\nFox hotel and Mr. Fox said that she\nmight stay all night and they made\nher a bed in the kitchen. The next\nmorning when the family arose the\nold darkey was not to be seen.\nSome time the next day she was seen\nout on Clear creek, which is about\n12 miles south of here. She refused\nto go to any house so some one took\nher a lunch which she ate under the\ntrees and then started on west. The\nnext that was seen of her, Bob Mc\nFarland came to town and notified\nthe sheriff that she was out about\nhis place 4 miles west of town wan\ndering about among the cattle.

It is to be built expressly\nfor the marines stationed at the navy\nyard, who will this summer take turns\nat the target. It is the intention to\nmake expert marksmen of the men,\nbo that they will become as proficient\nin the use of firearms as their brethren\nin the army.\nThe commercial treaty between the\nUnited States and Italy, just ratlflea\nby the Chamber of Deputies of the lat\nter country admits into our ports from\nItaly, at the reduced rates provided in\nsection 3 of the Dingley act, the arti\ncles therein enumerated, including\nbrandies, wines and works of art. We\nlook for a large increase in the im\nportation of Italian works of art.\nCharles Booth, a careful student of\nsocial conditions, says that "the un\nemployed are, as a class, a selection\nfrom the unfit; and on the whole,\nthose most In want are the most un\nfit." Of course, no employer can afford\nto pay a man for doing poor work.\nUnfitness may be either a misfortune\nor a fault. In either case, society suf\nfers, and must learn how to prevent\nthe increase of defective members by\nmaking industrial training a part cf\ngeneral education.\nRussia\'s czarina has organized an\n\'association of Russian women In re\nduced circumstances, who are almost\njconstantly employed for embroidery\n(for ecclesiastical purposes or for court\ndresses.

The French navy\nis the first to possess submarine boats\nreally worthy of the name, that is to\nsay, able under certain conditions to\ndischarge successfully the torpedoes\nwith which they are armed against\nhostile vessels, either anchored or In\nmotion.\nMilwaukee, famous for its beer, may\nnow claim distinction as being the\n"German city" of the United States.\nThere are more Germans in Milwau\nkee in proportion to Its population\nthan in any other city.

The vast sanitary improve\nments which have taken place in Eng\nland within thirty years and the evo\nlution of the whole system of scien\ntific and technical instruction are due\nto Playfair more than to any other\nman. He originally suggested the\nadoption of open half-penny letters,\nnow known as "post cards," and he\nwas largely instrumental in suggesting\n:the basis of an equitable agreement\nbetween Great Britain and America\nwhen President Cleveland\'s Venezue-\n;lan message had brought the two coun\ntries into dangerous antagonism.\n"Athletics are first-class as a pas\ntime," Governor Roosevelt recently\njsald to the boys , of St. Paul\'s school,\n"\'but they are as poor a business as the\nworld contains." Oliver Cromwell\'s\nstatement of the same truth is two\nhundred and fifty years earlier. He\nwrote to his little sons at school that\nhe did not grudge them "laudable re\ncreation nor honorable carriage in\nthem nor legitimate expense;" but\nthat he did emphatically protest\nagainst "pleasure and self-satisfaction\nbeing made the business of a man\'s\nlife."\nPrince Oukthomsky sent his cele-!\nbrated collections of bronze Mongol\nidols to the Russian Asiatic section of\nthe Paris exhibition.

The state de\npartment officials do not like European\ncriticisms more or less directly attrib\nuting to our government a lack of\nwhole-heartedness in the effort to get\nto Pekin. They point to what Ameri\ncan troops and marines have already\ndone; to the loss of life and limbs suf\nfered by them, and to the repeated\nurgings of the American officials at\nevery point looking to a forward move\nment on Pekin. And in answer to the\nintimation that they are responsive to\nChinese efforts to bribe us by the de\nlivery of Mr. Conger at Tien Tsin and\nthus seduce us to abandon the Pekin\ncampaign, the intimation was given\nthat the purpose was to head off a for\nmal proposition, as the department had\nbeen made aware by Mr. Goodnow and\nAdmiral Remey, it is presumed, that\nauggestions of this sort had been\nthrown out by the Chinese viceroys or\ntheir agents, though these had not been\nreduced to an official form. The de\npartment rather strengthened its po\nsition\' through being enabled in this\nway to re ject the proposition by antici\npation It is pointed out that even should\nthe powers agree to any such proposi\ntion, we would not consider it until\nMinister Conger\'s views were known\nIt is explained that to agree to such a\nplan might result in sending the min\nisters forward with an inadequate es\ncort and, if murdered, we would then\nbe stopped from demanding redress.\nVictory of a Girl.\nDes Moines, la., July 28.

General Hally,\ngeneral alloting agent of the interior\ndepartment, who has arrived here with\nfour assistants, to allot lands to the\nKiowas, Comanches and . Apaches,\nstates that he has orders to allot the\nlands in the Vichita reservation as\nsoon as the present job is completed.\nThe Wichita lands lie directly north of\nthe Kiowa and Comanche reservations,\nand are among the best in the terri\ntory. The reservation is the best in the\nterritory. It is well watered and tim\nbered and the finest of crops are raised\nwherever cultivated. The reservation\ncontains 743,610 acres, and was treated\nfor in 1891. In 1894 the treatv was\nratified and part of the allotments\nmade, but because of the interests of\nthe cattlemen no attempts have ever\nbeen made to complete the allotments\nor open the reservation. It is likely,\nhowever, that it will be opened at the\nsame time as the Kiowa and Comanche\ncountry. After the Indian allotments,\nschool and college lands, etc, are de\nducted, there will still be left 2,000\nquarter sections for settlers, most of it\nexcellent agricultural land.\nIT IS BREIDENTHAL.\nFall Ticket Named And Nomination of\nU.

Whether or not the\nlatter was guilty with Neeley, he says,\nthere can be no doubt that in the mat\nter of unauthorized per diem allow\nances, personal expenses and warrants\nunaccounted for, he unlawfully appro\npriated to his own use the money of\nthe United States. For this, Mr. Rath\nbone will be required to answer.\nThis From Shanghai.\nLondon, July 30.

WU IS HOPEFUL.\nWashington, July 28. There are no\nnew developments to warrant the as\nsumption that there will be the slight\nest improvement in the Chinese\nsituation. Indeed, the general tenor\nof such news as found light was to add\nto the steadily growing doubt as to the\ngood faith of the Chinese government\nas manifested in its acts.\nThen the exchanges that are in con\nstant progress between the powers are\ntending more and more to cast suspi\ncion upon the genuineness of the many\ncommunications that have come from\nPekin through Chinese governmental\nsources. If it should be finally estab\nlished that there has been an attempt\non their part to practice a gigantic\nfraud upon the world, the fact may\ncall for a change of attitude on the\npart of the United. States government\ntowards China. This would not affect\nthe military policy already under way,\nbut merely the technical relations be\ntween the two governments, which\nprobably would closely approximate a\nstep of formal war.\nThe Chinese minister expressed to\nSecretary Hill his continued hope that\nthe ministers in Pekin were still safe,\nand said he believed he would soon be\nable to deliver to the department a\nmessage from Minister Conger which\nwould make hope certain.\nLiterally Shot to Pieces.\nNew Orleans, July 30.

The alleged de\nparture of the ministers from Pekin\nhas led to a reassertion of the belief\nthat the story is part of a deep laid\nplant by China to conceal the massacre\nat Pekin suggestion being made by the\nChinese officers that the ministers left\nPekin under escort, but were ambush\ned and massacred by Boxers en route\nto Tien Tsin. However, although it is\nstill, believed a massacre has occurred\nof the foreign colony at Pekin, the\ndisposition now is to think the minis\nters were somehow rescued from a\ntragic fate.\nA German News Expedition.\nBerlin, July 26. The German fleet\nsociety will send on August 5 a news\nexpedition to China, for the purpose of\nreporting events entirely independent\nof Chinese or other newsgathering con\ncerns.

A writer in The\nBerliner Post says that both at Taku\nand Tien Tsin it was almost exclusively\na force of Chinese troops that fought\nthe allies, that the leadership of these\ntroops was in the hands of the imper\nial generals, and that the troops which\ncompelled Admiral Seymour to retreat\nwere imperial soldiers commanded by\nan imperial general.

This govern\nment has acted all the while on the\ntheory that the ministers were alive\nand has accepted in good faith the\nassurances of the the Chinese govern\nment\' to this effect;but it has not recog\nnized in any way the suggestion\ncontained in Cheng\'s cable that the\nChinese government should furnish the\nforeigners an escort out of Pekin. It\nwas said at the state department that\nthe American minister is not to be de\ndelivered up by a force of Chinese\ntroops to the allied forces or anyone\nelse.

Brief\nly, the Mafia is a species of Free Mas\nonry of the lowest possible description,\nthe main objects of which are the pro\ntection of all members who transgress\nthe laws. In other words, it may be\nregarded as an Anarchists\' protection\nsociety, of which the power is unlimit\ned, and the toils are everywhere. The\nmembers of the Mafia are legion, and,\nstrangely enough, more often than not\njoin against their own free will. The\nrich man joins either to advance his\npersonal position, to carry on a hered\nitary fraud, or because it is intimated\nto him that his influence and wealth\nare necessary to the society. If he re\nfuses his crops suddenly take fire, his\ncattle cat something poisonous, or he\nhimself is either found dead or is car\nried by "brigands" into the mountains\nand held for all the world like a\npledged article in a pawnbroker\'s shop\n\'until a heavy ransom is paid. The\npoor man, too, is equally bound to\nthrow in his lot with the Mafia. Nor\ncan one wonder at his choice, when we\nrecall the alternatives. Upon the one\nhand his endeavors to earn an honest\nliving will be boycotted by practically\nall his neighbors, and even by the large\nlandowners and shopkeepers to whom\nhe may apply for work. Once let him\njoin the brotherhood, however, and no\nmatter whr-.t his crime he will be pro\ntected to the last penny of the association.\nINJUDICIOUS TEACHER\nSaid Christ Had Brothers and Was Asked\nto Resign.\nHolyoke (Mass.)

It was thought that these\nwould show extra efficiency in main\ntaining moderate speed up an average\nincline, and that they woud show great\nsteadiness in climbing an unusual hill.\nPlenty of grades were met on the tour\nand the petroleum or gas motors gave\nfar less trouble than the others. The\ntour was not arranged to show speed,\nbut only to accustom people to many\nstyles of automobiles, and the general\nresults are spoken of as satisfactory.\nHon. C. S.

To make sure\nthat his eggs are fresh he puts about\n,eix ounces of common cooking salt\n\'in a deep glass holding water enough\nto barely dissolve the salt. When the\nsalt is dissolved an egg is dropped into\nthe solution, and this is the test: If\nthe egg sinks to the bottom of the\nglass at once it is not more than a day\n.old. If it lacks about an inch of touch\ning the bottom it is two days old. If It\nsinks only a little below the surface it\nis three days old, and if it floats on tha\nsurface it is at least five days old; tha\nhigher it rides the older the egg. ,\nMine Dear Johannesburg.\nThere are over 100 gold mines In\nthe Immediate neighborhood of Jo\nhannesburg, stretching out on all sides\nof the city.

So much so is this the case that\nit is indeed gratifying to the one seek\ning rest and recuperation from the\ncares of the business and social world,\nas well as the pain racked invalid,\nwho Is fortunate enough to discover a\nplace where to use a popular expres\nsion, he "gets his money\'s worth."\nOne of the most interesting, pictur\nesque and delightful places in this\ncountry is unquestionably the resort\nknown as the Maguo Mud and Lithia\nWater Cure, located at Indiana Mine\nral Springs, Indiana. Here come the\noverworked business man, the worn\nout devotee of society and the profes\nsional man on the verge of nervous\nprostration, as well as the sufferer\nfrom rheumatism, kidney and skin\ndiseases for which the baths are es\npecially beneficial. The place is also\nlargely patronized by those who only\nseek pleasure and recreation, its loca\ntion making it particularly adapted for\nthis purpose. There are many roman\ntic and beautiful spots and places of\ninterest in the vicinity and It would\nbe hard, to find a section of country\ncontaining so many beautiful drives.\nThe country is very hilly, but the\nroads are all graveled and kept in\ngood condition. This is one of the\nthings that makes the place especially\nattractive to tho6e afflicted with rheu\nmatism, as driving is about the only\noutdoor pleasure one crippled with\nrheumatism can indulge in. Some of\nthe cures effected are really marvel\nous and many who have gone to the\nMagno Mud Cure as a last resort have\nreturned home within a few weeks\nfilled with . renewed health and\nstrength.\nThe acepmmodations, service, table\nand attendance is all that can be de\nsired and the rates . very reasonable\nIndeed.

The fact of the matter is that the\nRepublican party is leaving more\nmen than there are men leaving the\nthat party.\nWe notice that Ex-Congressman\nSimpson got among some unruly\nnegroes at Ft.

Senotor. It takes\nsome antidated politicians a long\ntime to find out just what people do\nthink of them.\nThe state convention held at Fort\nScott was one of the most harmon\nious fusion conventions ever held in\nKansas. All parties were fully sat\nisfied with the nominations and went\nhome feeling that the ticket would\nbe triumphantly elected next Novem\nber. Webster Davis, David Over-\nmeyer, Congressman DeArmond of\nMissouri and other prominent Demo\ncrats made addresses, all of which\nwere received with great applause\nThe following is from the Mail\nand Breeze in regaru to the ticket\nnominated at Fort Scott:\n"We will frankly say" that in our\nopinion . the ticket made up by the\ncohorts is as strong as they could\n1 have made it. Briedenthal has\nsome bitter enemies in the ranks of\nhis own party, who tried to make a\nfight on him in the convention and\nmay fight him at the polls, but in\nspite of the fact we are of the opin\nion that Breidenthal is the strong\nest candidate they could have nom\ninated. The rest of the ticket will\nget the party vote, whatever that\nmay be. So far as we happen to\nknow them they are reasonably com-\n. petent and popular . gentlemen.\nThere will be no room for mud\nslinging on either side in the cam\nThe Denver Stockman says: "It\nis beginning to dawn on the chief\nexecutive of the state of Kansas that\nthe live-stock sanitary board of that\nstate is an incompetent, unnecessary\nbody. He proposes to ask the next\nlegislature to abolish it. This will\nbe a great relief to the stockmen\nwho have been held up for inspec\ntion fees after the stock had been\npassed by a competent Government\ninspector. The Government has\nthorough men in charge of its work\nin the South, and no damage has re\nsulted from any that have come\nNorth after passing them. To make\nassurance doubly sure is all right\nenough, but for that satisfaction an\nother method than the one practiced\nby the Kansas board can be adopt\ned with success and satisfaction to\nthe stockmen of Kansas. A com\npetent veterinarian, appointed by\nthe state and put on a salary, will\ndo the business, snd shippers will\nnot be subjected to the heavy ex\npenses the present plan calls for.\nOther states that are levying this\nunjust toll could adopt the same\nidea."\nSenator Wellington, who some\ntime ago declared that he would not\nsupport McKinley for re-election, is\nstill throwing nuts to the adminis\ntration which it cannot or will not\ncrack. \' The Senator said, while in\nWashington, a day or two ago: If\nthe situation in the Philippines is as\nfavorable as the administration\nwould have us believe, there is no\nreason why twelve or fifteen thous\nand men could not be sent from\nthere to service in China. I think\nthat would be America\'s fair quota\nof the international force for the re\nlief of Pekin, and beyond the pro\ntection of American life and prop\nerty, this country has no business\nto interfere with the affairs of the\nChinese empire. American troops\nshould never form a part of an army\nfor the conquest of China. The\nEuropean powers have sowed the\nwind and are now reaping the whirl\nwind. They have been looking for\ntrouble in China for a long time and\nnow they have it. The fire they\nhave kindled is a hot one, and this\ngovernment should look well to it\nthat American troops are not used\nas a catspaw for the pulling out of\nEuropean chestnuts."

Plow well;\nharrow each day\'s plowing before\nthe sun goes down; harrow soon af\nter every rain; roll and harrow at\nsome time before sowing. Later\nthan the last of August it is unsafe\nto sow alfalfa. Under favorable\ncircumstances early September sow\ning may get sufficient- strength to\nlive through the winter, but it is un\nwise to take the risk. If the land\nis very poor defer sowing it to al\nfalfa for a season or two, and ma\nnure and cultivate the land well with\nsome crop that will grow on it.\nStrong lime-stone land is best for\nalfalfa, but sandy land impregnaten\nwith hard water is good.\nSow 20, 30 or 40 pounds of seed\non each acre. Seed may be sown\nbroadcast or with drill.\nMuch of the difficulty in getting a\nstand of alfalfa is on account of the\nweeds except in localties where\ngrasshoppers are numerous. Fall\nseeding on land prepared as above\nsuggested eliminates the weed prob\nlem in most cases. If the alfalfa\ngets through until next spring with\na good stand it will fight its own\nbattles with the weeds from that\ntime forward. . The first advantage\nof August over spring sowing is the\nstart the alfalfa gets of the weeds,\nand the second is the saving of a\nseason in the use of the land.\nSpring sowing makes little or no hay\nthe first season.\' ,\nOup Correspondents.

This new line is 88 miles\nlong and is built through the heart of the\nWashita valley. Thus located, the line\nthroughout nearly its entire length, lies with\nin the Kiowa, Commanche and Apache reser\nvation. Already several towns are located\non this new branch, the chief ones being\nAnadarko, Mountain View, Kiowa and Gran\nite, which is at present the terminus of the\nroad and is situated just across the line in\nGreer county, Oklahoma.\nMuch interest is being manifested, especial\nly in the west over the Kiowa, Commanche\nand Apache reservation being opened up to\nsettlement. Much has been written about\nthis new land and the papers generally both\neast and west, have contained many write-ups\nconcerning the resources and its value both\nas an agricultural and mining district. Prob\nably nowhere in the Indian Territories is\nthere such a yaluable tract of land as is this\nKiowa, Commanche and Apache reservation,\nand it is the last of the large tracts of land to\nbe opened up to settlement. It contains up\nwards of two millions of acres, which will be\nthrown open to the public as soon as the\nPresident issues his proclamation to that effect.\nA word about this new land might be inter\nesting. At least 90 per cent of the land is\nrich agricultural land, which will make as\nfine farms as can be found anywhere in the\nwest, The Wichita mountains are included\nwithin the limits of the reservation. Gold,\nsilver and copper have been found in these\nhills and it is said by experienced miners that\ngreat riches are there. Timber and creek\nbottoms are plentiful. Natural gas has been\ndiscovered at Granite, and petroleum oil is a\ncertainty. Coal has been found, and many\nprospeciors are already on the ground. The\ntown of Granite already gives promise of be\ning one of the chief towns in that country,\nIt is growing daily with remarkable rapidity.\nIt is surrounded by mountains, shady groves\nand running brooks. The Rock Island will\nrun a low rate popular excursion to Granite\non Sunday, August 5. At this time exhibi\ntions will be given of the natural gas burning\nand visits will be made to the gas wells to\nwitness the wonderful flow, pronounced by\nexperts to be the richest surface flow of natu\nral gas ever discovered in America.\nTHE NEW YORK WORLD,\nTHR1CE-A-WEEK EDITION.\nAs Good to You as a Dally and Yon get it at\nthe Price ot a Weekly.\nIt furnishes more at the price than any\nother newspaper published in America.
