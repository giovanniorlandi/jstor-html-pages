        <pre>["Justifying Germany in 1914\nBy COUNT MAX von MONTGELAS\nEminent German historian; a leading “ Revisionist'*\nT HE most serious o f the Entente myths \nto support the doctrine that Ger\xad\nmany alone was responsible for \nprecipitating the World War, was set forth \nrecently by Professor Bernadotte E. \nSchmitt and Dr. Heinrich Kanner. The \ncore of this contention is that Germany \nand Austria entered into a provocative \nmilitary convention in January and Feb\xad\nruary, 1909 (1908, according to Kanner) i \nand that on the 30th and 31st of July, \n1914, Germany and Austria decided upon \ngeneral mobilization before they had any \ndecisive evidence that Russia had de\xad\ntermined upon her general mobilization. \nI f  this view can be maintained it would \nimply that the chronological priority o f \nthe Russian mobilization did not provoke \nthe German decision upon those military \nmeasures which specifically initiated the \nformal state o f war. An excellent state\xad\nment o f this new thesis is to be found in \nProfessor Schmitt’s rejoinder in his debate \nwith Professor Harry Elmer Barnes before \nthe Chicago Council on Foreign Relations \non April 3, 1926, from which we quote P \nReference must not be made to an ex\xad\ntraordinary exchange o f  letters between \nGeneral von Moltke and Conrad von Hoet- \nzendorf, Chief of the Austrian General \nStaff, which took place in January and Feb\xad\nruary, 1909. It was carried on with the \nknowledge and approval o f the Emperors \nof the two countries and their respective \nGovernments, and the purpose o f this ex\xad\nchange of letters was to insure a greater \ndegree of secrecy than would be j>°ssible \nif  a formal military convention were signed.\nThe first letter is a request from  the \nAustrian staff to know under what circum\xad\nstances Austria can count upon German \narmed support. Moltke replies, Jan. 21, \n1909, that i f  Austria moves against Serbia, \nundertakes military action against Serbia, \nand Russia mobilizes even against Austria, \nnot only will Austria be expected to  mobil1\nRecent jDisclosures Concerning the Origins \no f  the World War* pp. 21-23,\nize, but Germany herself will mobilize and \nrecognize what the diplomats call the cams \nfoederis, that is, the application o f the alli\xad\nance. This, it seems to me, was a much \ngreater transformation o f  an alliance orig\xad\ninally defensive, as the Austro-German Alli\xad\nance o f 1879 undoubtedly was, into an offen\xad\nsive instrument than anything Poincare \nand Sazonov accomplished between 1912 and \n1914.\nIn 1914 this schedule which Moltke had \nforeseen was realized to the dot. The Rus\xad\nsian partial mobilization was ordered on \nJuly 29, very late in the evening. The next \nday that was converted into a general \nmobilization, the news o f which reached \nBerlin at 11;40 A , M., Friday, July 81, and \nVienna some time later, the exact hour not \nbeing known. Nevertheless, on the evening \no f July 30, twelve hours before he had \nlearned o f the Russian general mobilization, \nMoltke, the Chief o f the German Staff, sent \na telegram to Conrad saying that Austria \nmust mobilize because Russia bad mobilized \nin part; that Germany would mobilize and \nthat the casus foederis would arise; and \nlater on he followed that up with another \ntelegram saying that the acceptance of a \nEuropean war by  Austria was the only \ncondition on which Austria-Hungary could \nhope to survive.\nThe Austrians likewise decided on their \nown mobilization before they knew o f the \nRussian general mobilization. So that, it \nseems to me, from  the point o f view o f the \nsequence o f events, Germany was prepared \nto mobilize before she knew o f the Russian \nmobilization. She did not do so because \nMoltke was not able to convince Bethmann- \nHollweg and the Kaiser that it was neces\xad\nsary. The German General Staff had pre\xad\ncisely the same attitude toward the situa\xad\ntion as the Russian General Staff and be\xad\ntween the activities o f  the Russian and the \nGerman soldiers I  see very little difference. \nIt was the action o f the military men in \nboth countries which forced the situation. \n* & &\nMoltke, who had from  the early days o f \nthe crisis clearly been anxious fo r  mobiliza\xad\ntion, convinced the Kaiser and the Chancel\xad\nlor, against their better judgment, to make\n77\n", '78 CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1927\nthe Russian mobilization the casus belli. \nAnd to me the most significant thing about \nMoltke’s attitude throughout the crisis is \nthat on July 26, before a single declaration \no f war had been issued, he was drafting \nthe ultimatum which Germany later sent to \nBelgium* Already, so soon, he was thinking \nof the ultimate rupture,\nConsad-Moltke  N otes of 1909\nThis new doctrine o f German responsi\xad\nbility has been set forth more thoroughly \nby the Austrian Germanophobe, Dr, \nHeinrich Kanner, in his Der Schtussel zwr \nKrzegsschuldfrage (Key to the Question of \nWar Responsibility), Vienna, 1926. In \nthis he emphasizes the significance o f the \nConrad-Moltke exchange of 1909 (1908) ; \nmoreover, he tries to prove that as early as \nJuly 30 (1914), the German Government \nhad resolved “ under any circumstances”  to \ndeclare on the following day the “ state of \nimminent danger o f war,”  and to address \nat the same time a summons to St, Peters\xad\nburg to stop all preparations for war. \nAccording to the pamphlet mentioned, the \ndispatch of Count Pourtales, which about \nnoon of July 31 announced the general \nmobilization in Russia, arrived “ in the \nvery nick of time”  (fort a propos) to sup\xad\nply a motive “ after the event”  for a de\xad\ncision taken on the previous day.\nAs a complete refutation of the thesis \no f Schmitt and Kanner that Moltke and \nConrad perfected a secret military con\xad\nvention in 1909, we could not do better \nthan to quote from Professor Fay’s dev\xad\nastating criticism of Kanner’s monograph \nin the American Historical Review for \nJanuary, 1927.2\nThe pamphlet fKanner’sJ shows how \nmany wrong-headed conclusions can he \narrived at by  a biased Journalist who lacks \nevidence o f historical training and accuracy \nand who is hent on twisting evidence to \nprove that the war was caused by the Ger\xad\nman and Austrian Chiefs o f  Staff. He \nclaims to have discovered what no one else \nhas been able to  find out: “ The Key to the \nQuestion o f W ar Guilt.”  He discovered it \nin the mass o f papers published as Conrad’s \nmemoirs (Aits meiner Dimstzeit), which he \nseems to think that he alone has waded \nthrough. There are others, however, who\nhave toiled through these ponderous vol\xad\numes and never found the “ key”  which \nKanner has “ discovered,”  W hy? Because \nit  is not there, Kanner’s <fkey”  is a sup\xad\nposed “ Military Convention,”  contained in \na  letter of Moltke to Conrad o f Jan, 21, \n1909. Kanner (p. 15) incorrectly dates it \n1908 instead o f 1909 and quotes a  few  \nselected sentences dealing with the hypoth\xad\nesis that, i f  Austria should invade Serbia \nand Russia should intervene, this would be \nthe casits foederis for  Germany. He omits \nto mention that this letter was in answer \nto a communication from  Conrad asking for  \na personal meeting; that Moltke declined \na  personal meeting fo r  fear o f the exciting \neffect it might have on public opinion at a \nmoment when the crisis arising from  the \nannexation o f  Bosnia was still troubling \nEurope; and that he said he believed it \naltogether likely that Russia, fo r  various \nreasons, would keep still, even in ease o f a \nmilitary conflict between Austria and Ser\xad\nbia, Neither this letter nor the others \nwhich, were exchanged at this time between \nMoltke and Conrad constituted in any sense \na  “ Military Convention.”  Kanner cannot \nquote a  single passage anywhere in which \nany one in authority anywhere ever refers \nto this exchange o f views as being a “Mili\xad\ntary Convention.”  This conception is his \nown unwarranted invention. This Moltke- \nConrad correspondence, regarding the desir\xad\nable disposition o f troops on the Russian \nfrontier in case o f war, grew out o f Con\xad\nrad’s effort to have Germany’ s mobilization \nplans provide as many troops as possible \nagainst Russia, Moltke in turn wanted to \nhave Austria plan to use few  troops in \nSerbia in order to send as many as possible \ninto Galicia to relieve pressure on Ger\xad\nmany. These arrangements were hardly as \ndefinite or as binding as those which had \nbeen made by the French and Russian staffs \nfo r  some years before this. Though some \no f the Moltke-Conrad letters were shown \nto the civilian authorities, they did not \nlegally modify the terms o f the alliance,\nKanner argues* that the “ Military Con\xad\nvention”  resulted in a  German “ decision”  \nfo r  war, many hours before the arrival o f \nthe news o f  Russian general mobilization; \nthat it was not Russian mobilization but \nMoltke’s promises to Conrad which are to \nblame fo r  the outbreak o f the war. But \nhis evidence and arguments are not con\xad\nvincing.\nWe may now turn more specifically to3F ay: 1. c„ p. 318,\n', 'JUSTIFYING GERMANY IN 1914 79\nKaimer’s charge that Moltke and Conrad \nhad decided upon and ordered mobiliza\xad\ntion before learning of the Russian mobili\xad\nzation, In order to refute this thesis it is \nsufficient to recall two conversations of \nthe German Chief of the General Staff \nwith his associates, A  little after mid\xad\nnight, July 30-31, General von Moltke said \nto Lieut. Col. von Haeften: 4(Jfe have two \nreports that merit credence, the one inde\xad\npendent o f the other, which prove that in \nRussia the general mobilization o f all the \narmed forces has already been ordered”  \n(W e  know today that those two reports \nwere very accurate, for six hours before \nthis the telegraphic order for the mobiliza\xad\ntion had arrived in all the centres o f the \nCzars Empire.) Nevertheless, notwith\xad\nstanding information “ worthy o f cre\xad\ndence,”  von Moltke added: “ Before advis\xad\ning his Majesty to mobilize I  wish to await \na third confirmation o f the news about the \nRussian mobilization”\nV on M oltke ’s Cautious A ttitude\nThe second conversation took place hy \ntelephone about 7 o’clock in the morning \nof the 31st. A  staff officer at Allenstein \n(in East Prussia)\' reported that the red \norders o f mobilization had already been \nposted up on the other side o f the frontier. \nEven then von Moltke refused to see in this \nreport the third confirmation that he was \nwaiting for, hut answered: “ It is neces\xad\nsary that you procure one o f those posted \norders. It is essential that I  have the cer\xad\ntainty that they are really mobilizing \nagainst us, Before having that certainty I  \nam not able to elicit a mobilization \norder” z\nThe defenders o f Russia will object \nthat there exist two documents according \nto which the attitude o f von Moltke was \nless reserved.4 One is a report signed hy \nthe military attache o f Austro-Hungary at \nBerlin, sent o ff at 9:40 P.

The suggestion as to new steps by \nEngland was undoubtedly beyond Moltke’s \ncompetence. However, it exercised no influ\xad\nence upon the decisions o f the Vienna Cab\xad\ninet, fo r  it  was not even discussed at the \nCotmeil o f  Ministers on July 31J  Also the \ntext o f this suggestion is challenged,®\n4. Finally, the promise that Germany \nwould mobilize on her part is explained by  \nthe conviction, based upon numerous re\xad\nports, that Russia, under the cover o f the \nofficial mobilization against Austria, had \nalready simultaneously proceeded to mobil\xad\nize secretly against Germany,\nThe essential point is that the two docu\xad\nments, revealed hy the Memoirs of Conrad, \ndo not weaken in any respect the capital \ntestimony of the two conversations men®This\ndispatch is not to "be found either In \nthe archives at Berlin, nor in those at Vienna, \nnor among the posthumous papers of Conrad. \nThe text has been reconstructed from notes \ntaken by Conrad’s aide-de-camp.\n^Compare the opinion of Kenouvin, the emi\xad\nnent French historian: Austria “had reason \nto act in this way/*\niAustrian Red Boole, Vol. in, No. 79.\n^According to the notes of the military \nattache of Austria-Hungary, it -was not a \nquestion of stopping the mediation already in \ncourse of operation, but of rejecting “new \nsteps if any occur.”  See Die Kriegsschuld- \nfrage, August, 1926, p. 525, note 21.\n', "80 CURRENT HISTORY, APRIL, 1927\ntioned above o f Moltke with Ms collabora\xad\ntors, and from which it follows that he had \nno chance o f obtaining the consent either \nof the Emperor or the Chancellor for a \nGerman mobilization before the Russian \ngeneral mobilisation was confirmed in an \nindubitable manner. Let us add the fo l\xad\nlowing to these two other documents.\nAt the very hour, namely, at noon on \nJuly 31, when the fatal dispatch of \nPour tales was Being deciphered at Berlin, \nthe Emperor was writing from Potsdam_to \nthe Minister o f Marine an autograph letter \nin wMch he spoke at length o f the Anglo- \nGerman mediation, and in which he said: \n“ Between Vienna and Peterhof diplomatic \nconversations have at last been begun, and \nPeterhof has asked for the mediation of \nLondon,”9\nAt noon on July 81 Wilhelm II was still \nfull o f hope that peace could be main°Oer»ian\nDocuments on the Outbreak o f  the  \nWorld W ar, No. 474.\ntained, A  little while afterward that hope \nvanished.
