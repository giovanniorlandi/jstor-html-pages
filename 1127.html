Ev\nidently she was much pleased with\nthe new arrival, for her eyes rested\nupon a sweet, frank face, a-graceful,\ncompact form and an attire as neat\nas it was sensible.\n“I hardly expected to find* yon so\nyoung,” Mrs, Cameron said.\n“No?” asked Miss Conover. “Still\n—yon will find me proficient.”\n“Oh, to be sure,” Mrs. Cameron\nhurriedly said. “Please walk down\nto breakfast.”\nThe breakfast room reached, she\nsaid:\n“Miss Conover Brice Ruther\nford, my nephew.”\nThe name startled the young lady\nso much that her self possession al\nmost failed her. She bowed in rec\nognition of the introduction, and\nthen turned her attention to the\ntwo children who were to be under\nher charge.\nDuring the morning meal she\ncast several, furtive glances at\nBrice Rutherford. He was young,\nhandsome, refined, with .perhaps\nrather an exalted opinion of him\nself.\nIt was not remarkable that dur\ning the summer he began to take\nconsiderable interest in the pretty\nlittle governess. He was thrown al\nmost daily in her society, and her\nfrankness was especially charming\nto him because he was not much\ndisposed to he frank himself.\nHis interest at last assumed a\nmore fervedt shape and finally led\nhim to make a declaration of love.\nA look of triumph crossed her face,\nbut it escaped his notice, for she\nwas seated in the shadow.\n“This isn’t unexpected,” she re\nplied, “lint”—\nBrice Rutherford frowned at the\nremark and waited for her to con\nclude it.\n“You see, you don’t know any\nthing about me,” she said, starting\nin afresh.\n“Oh, hut 1 flatter myself I do,”\nwas his reply. “I never act without\nproper consideration.”\n“1 mean as to my—my—antece\ndents,” Miss Conover said. “As to\nmy—my —purposes’’—\n“1 don’t care about your antece\ndents,” he interrupted, “and as for\nyour purposes I hope one of them\nwill be to make me as happy as\nyou can!”\n“Oh, to lie sure,” replied she.\n“Well, I am glad thal we under\nstand each other, and”—\n“But 1 don’t know that we do,”\ninterrupted she in turn. “1 know\nthat you proposed to me, but I can\nnot recall that I accepted yon.”\n“Oh!” he ejaculated, with a Crest\nfallen look.\nMiss Conover laughed softly and\nsaid, “I am willing to hold your\noffer under advisement.”\n“That will not satisfy me*,” he\nreplied.\n“But it must,” rejoined she. “I\nthink 1 am according you a great\ndeal.”\n“Well maybe you are,” he said\nwith a grimace. “I can’t say that\nI’m excessively grateful.”\n“I’ll give you my answer in Sep\ntember, Miss Conover replied.\n“That isn’t far off, you know.”\n“Well, no, it isn’t,” assented he,\nand that closed the conversation.\nin the early part of September\nbusiness took him into the city\nand he was absent a week. When\nhe returned to his aunt’s country\nseat, he found that the pretty little\ngoverness was no longer there. He\nwas almost duinfounded.\n“Where is she?” he asked.\n“1 don’t know,” replied Mrs.\nCameron. “Among her friends, no\ndoubt.”\n“She is coming hack?”\n“No, much to my regret and the\ndisappointment of the children.”\nBrice Rutherford stared at the\ncarpet.\n“Did she leave a message for\nme?” he asked.\n“A letter, at least,” replied Mrs.\nCameron. “I notice that there is\none on her bureau directed to you.”\nHe hurried upstairs in a manner\nnot in keeping with his habitual\ndignity. W hen he opened the en\nvelope, he was surprised to find one\nof his own letters in it, although\nhe had never written to her. A\nlook of consternation spread over\nhis face as he read it.\nIn his boyhood he had bad a little\nsweetheart named Rose Ralston. It\nwas stipulated between the parenta\nof both that the two should be mar\nried when they were old enough.\nHe was sent to school on the con\ntinent, where he stayed until he\nhad attained his majority. He then\nwrote home, declining to renew the\nattachment of his boyhood or to\ncarry out the stipulations. Indeed,\nso emphatic was he t£at one or two\nsentences were unkind, because un\ncalled for.\nHe stared at the letter in a (faxed\n“How did Miss Conover get hold\nof it ?” be asked himself, “and what\nwas her object in redirecting it to\nme? She promised to give me her\ndecision”—\nHe broke the line of his thought\nwith a sharp exclamation.\n“I’ve solved the mystery,” he mut\ntered. “Kate Conover is Rose Ral\nston. She is a little flirt and fan\ncies that she’s got even with me.”\nHe closed his conjectures with\nan expression which was near pro\nfanity.\n“Aunt Rachel,” he said, when he\nhad rejoined his aunt, “dp you know ,\nthat Mias Conover is * KSsl\'yltal\n•ton?”\n“Impossible!” exclaimed Mrs.\nCameron.\n“But, aunt, she is.”\n“Did she say so ?”\n“No. Do you think her coming\nhere was—was —planned?”\n“Why, no, Brice. It came about\nby accident. She didn’t know you\nwere here or that I am your aunt.”\n“You are sure of that?”\n“Of course I am. What does she\nsay in the letter?”\n“It isn’t from her.”\n“Eh! Who, then?”\n“Why did she masquerade here\nunder another name?” evaded Brice.\n“Why should she masquerade any\nwhere?”\n“My dear boy, I can’t answer\nthat,” Mrs. Cameron said. “I am\nnot convinced that she did.”\n“Well, it doesn’t matter much\nanyhow,” Rutherford rejoined,\nwhich was a bold falsehood, for he\nknew that it mattered a good deal\nto him.\nA year later found Kate Conover\nstanding in a grove in the Yellow\nstone park. She was looking down\na long vista of charming scenery,\nher face bronzed, her form plump\nand the blue in her eyes deeper and\nsweeter than ever.\nShe heard footsteps behind her,\nand on turning around beheld a\nhandsome, sun browned tourist. A\nsecond, and her face grew very red,\nfor the man was Brice Rutherford-\nShe had punished him, to he sure,\nhut she had also punished herself.\nHe relieved her of her embar\nrassment by offering his hand with\neasy gracefulness.\n“I’ll now take your answer,” he\nsaid.\n“What answer?” she asked, with\nrenewed blushes.\n“This is September,” he re\nminded.\n“Oh!” ejaculated she. “So it is,\nhut I named last September. I left\nyou my answer.”\n“But there wasn’t anything in it\nfor me, or else 1 was too stupid to\nsee it. It may have implied”—\n“Yes, it implied,” she interrupted,\nwith a charming little laugh.\n“Oh, bother that idiotic letter!”\nBrice cried\n“ And • your stumpy, romping,\nfreckled faced tomboy sweetheart.\nRose Ralston,” added she, quoting\nfrom the letter.\n“I meant nothing by it, and I’m\nsorry I wrote it,” replied Brice, get\nting red in the face In turn. “I\ncould not foresee that I’d after\nward meet Rose Ralston in Kate\nConover and fall in love with her.\nY’ou have two names, and you\nshould not be punctilious about as\nsuming a third. Mine is at your\nservice. Please give me the answer\nyou promised.”\n“Well, Brice,” she said, her blue\neyes dancing with fun, “I am not\nable to recall the question with\nmuch distinctness. If you will re\npeat it in the same attitude with the\nsame fervor and with the same wild,\nwaiting look in your eyes, perhaps\nI may he able”—\n“Oh, 1 couldn’t,” interrupted\nBrice, laughing. “One such effort\nin a lifetime is enough. I haven’t\nyet recovered the energy which I\nexpended on that occasion. You in\ntend to accept me, hut you are too\n—too—modest to say so. I will not\ninsist, you know.”\n“Oh, thank you,” she replied. “It\nis a—great relief to me.”\nAnd. as they were married be\nfore the close of the year, it is pre\nsumed that they reached an under\nstanding at last.\nThe Folly of Overecneitivcneee.\nOversensitive people are usually\nvenr fine grained, highly organized\nand Intelligent, and if they would\novercome this weakness would be\ncome capable, conscientious work\ners. This failing—for it is a failing,\nand a very serious one, too—is an\nexaggerated form of self conscious\nness, which, while entirely different\nfrom egotism or conceit, causes self\nto loom up in such large propor\ntions on the mental Mtina as to\novershadow everything* else. The\nvictim of it feels that wherever ha\ngoes, whatever he does, he is the\ncenter of observation and that all\neyes, all thoughts are fooowj upon\nmm. He imagines that are\ncriticising his movements and his\nperson and making fun at his ex\npense, when in reality they are not\nthinking of him and perhaps did\nnot see him.—Success.\nBnAsallaf in Maine.\nWhen ipe Lord changed the color\nof a fox afur from red to black or\ngray, saM Jason Norton, the aged\nfox hualSF of Penobscot Valley, “be\ngave tbagtvored animals new skill\nin self-gMectioD and fitted them out\nwith brails of larger capacity.\nI have nun ted foxes for more than\nforty yee|| and I have killed more\nOf ibis number seven\nty-five or Eighty were cross foxes,\nwhose peip are worth from S4O to\nt 75 todaylloarteen were black foxes\ntiumP** a -^ v * r\nIf a red To x was half as cunning\nas they say be is, he would never be\nshot ahead of the dogs. So long as\nthere is plenty of room for a fox to\nrun in and the room is in a direct\nline, he can distance the best dog\nliving at the quarter post and get so\nfar away in half a day that the hun\nters could not see him again for a\nweek.\nBut a red fox hasn\'t learned that\na straight line is the shortest dis\ntance between two points, which\nshows that be has never studied\ngeometry. As soon as be bears a\ndog yipping behind him he sits\ndown and studies a bit to make\nsure if he is the fox that is picked\nfor the chase.\nIf he finds out that the dogs are\nafter another fox, the chances are\nthat he will* be envious and will\nspend a lot of time in cutting across\nbis rival trail and trying to confuse\nthe dogs.\nNo sooner is a red fox sure that\nhe is selected for the hunt than he\nloses all caution and devotes his en\nergies to having fun with the dogs.\nHe climbs up the trunks of leaning\ntrees for the sake of leaping off into\na distant snowdrift, be teeters along\nthe top of fences and sneaks down\nthe channels of running brooks, hop\ning that the water will kill the\nscent.\nAfter being funny for a lime, be\nwill sit down on a sunny knoll and\nlisten and laugh to himself to hear\nthe dogs swear about him. He will\ndo these tricks until the dogs are\ntired and mod clear through, and\nthen he will begin to run in a circle\nso be can keep the dogs within ear\nshot all the time.\nAnd this is what finishes him up,\nfor as soon as the hunters learn that\nhe is moving in a curve, they calcu\nlate the diameter of his circuit, cut\nacross to head him off, and the next\ntime he comes aromi smiling at the\njoke be is playing on the dogs, he is\nmet in the face with a charge of dou\nble B shot and he never laughs\nagain.\nNo one ever knew a black fox of\na silver gray to be guilty of such\nfolly. As soon as a fox with a costly\novercoat on his back hears the dogs\nbellowing behind him he sniffs\naround a bit to learn the direction of\nthe wind and is off to windward at\nthe rate of thirty miles an hours.\nAs be keeps his nose to the wind\nall the time, he can smelloutany dan\nger that may be ahead of him, and so\nlong as he keeps running he is sure\nthat nothing can overtake him from\nbehind. If the dogs happen to be of\nthe long-legged kind, such as they\nuse in England, the fox has to stir\nbis feet pretty lively for a few hours,\nbut when the dogs grow tired, be\nsettles down loan easy lopeot twelve\nor fifteen miles an hour and does not\nstop until he is 100 miles away.\nMeantime the dogs drop out as\nthey grow tjred and go wandering\nabout in the,woods trying to make a\nshortcut foqrhome. They haul up at\nfarm bouses along the way to rest,\nand the last one is not captured and\nbrought home for a week. By this\ntime the fox will have returned to\nhis old feeding grounds and had a\nnice long rest, so be will be ready\nfor another run.\nIt is my candid belief that if all\nthe foxes in Maine were put together\nso we could look them over, the blacks\nand silver grays combined would\nequal the number of reds. They are\ngaining in numbers every year, too.\nThe reason why we do not shot\nthem is because they are wiser and\nless humorous than their red\ncousins.\nGrip Remedies in Great Demand.\nWhen colds and grip are preva\nlent the quickest and surest reme\ndies are in great demand. Mr. Jo\nseph D.

Of course, as soon as they\ntouched anything, that had to go to\nwaste.

March 23, 1908\'\nThe decision of the Anthracite\nCoal Strike Commission has just\nbeen made public and will doubtless\nbe regarded as a victory for the\nminers\'not only in that it awards\nto them the increase in wages for\nwhich they principally struck, but\nin that it refutes the economic pro\nposition advanced by President\nBaer and other mine operators. Cm\nibis subject the Commission says,\n\'\'Undoubtedly the proposition that\nmen who own the property and carry\non the business must control it is\ngenerally true and its maintenance\nis necessary to the politicial and\neconomical welfare of society; but\nit is also true that where a business\nis of such magnitude and its physi\ncal conditions are such as to con\nstitute a natural monopoly, it is\naffected with a public interest which\ncannot be ignored by those who\ncontrol it." While submitting that\nthey do not feel authorized, under\nexisting conditions, toadvocatecom\npulsory arbitration the Commis\nsioners recommend a law proposed\nby Cbsales F.

Men employed nine hours\nare to be paid on a ten hours basis\nand provision is made for an in\ncrease in wages of 1 per cent, for\nevery increase in the wholesale\nprice of coal, above *4,50 per ton,\nfor pea coal. The average price\nof coal is to be determined by a\ncommissioner appointed by a United\nStates Circuit Judge and paid by\noperators. The miners are per\nmitted all the check-weighers they\nmay demand but they are to be paid\nat the miners expense.

U is further\nprovided that all disputes arising\nduring the period for which the\nCommission makes its awards, shall\nbe adjudicated by a "joint concilia\ntory committee" to consist of six\nmembers, three to be appointed by\nthe operators aud throe by the\nminers. In the event that an\nagreement cannot be reached by\nthis evenly divided committee, the\ncommittee shall select a seventh\nmember who shall cast the deciding\nvote. No discrimination shall be\nmade against union or nonunion\nminers and all awards shall stand\nuntil March 31, 1906.\n•\n• •\nThe special session of the Senate\nof the Fifty-eighth Congress has\nadjourned, after ratifying the\nand Cuban treaties. Atten\ntion now turns to the action of\nColombia on the canal treaty and\nthe magnitude of the undertaking\nto which the United States has com\nmitted itself. It is estimated by\nthose who believe in the success of\nthe agreement, that about the\nautumn of 19U4 some 20,000 negroes\narmed with spades and picks will\ninvade the isthmus of Panama and\nbegin digging. It is said by the\nengineers that 20,000 will be a\nminimum force of laborers and that\nas high as 50,000 may be employed\nat times. There are now about 1 ,(K>o\nmen at work unde** the French com\npany and every foot of the ground\nfor the canal has been broken\nThere is no contract labor law which\napplies to the isthmusand doubtless\nnegroes from all the West Indian\nislands will be imported and a\nfew may go from the United States,\nalthough those already acclimated\nwill be given preference as the\namount of sickness will be materially\ndiminished. Labor on the isthmus\ncommands from 40 to 50 cents per\nday. There are now on the route\nof the canal twothomughly equipped\nhospitals aud these will doubtless be\nkept full to overflowing as none but\nAmericans will be given the higher\ngrades of work. All details of the\nconstruction will he determined by\nIsthmian Canal Commission the\nmembers of which the President\nwill appoint as soon as the treaty is\nratified by Colombia.\n•\n• *\nThe provisions of the Cuban treaty,\nas ratified, will not go Into effect\nuntil the next session of Congress\nas it has been so amended as to\nnecessitate favorable action by both\nhouses and Senator McEnery of\nLouisiana tells your correspondent?\nthat he believes the agreement has\nbeen virtually killed, that the\nHouse will inevitably amend any\nbill approving itaod thus precipitate\nextended discussion in the Senate\nand that the upshot will be ultimate\nand absolute failure of the whole\nproject. Senator New lauds introdu-\nced but subsequently withdrew, an\namendment inviting Cuba to become\nannexed to the United Slates. The\nSenator is confident that when be\nreintroduces ibis smendment next\nyear it will meet with oonslderbaie\nsupport from republicans. Senator\nElkins is already on record as\nfavoring annexation and others |\nadroit that they favor the propost-1\ntkm but are not ready to be quoted\nIn fevor of It. Mr. Newlands says\nthat it will be much wiser to press\nimmigration before the island be\ncomes filled up with undesirable\nimmigrants and the leaders of both\nparties admit that annexation is\ncertain to come some time. Senator\nNewlands does not stand for any-1\nthing in the character of forcible\nannexation but would merely extend\nsuch an invitation to Cuban in order\nthat the idea might grow and gain\nstrength.\n• •\n♦\nOne of the gravest errors of Presi\ndent Roosevelt’s administration\ntook place during the closing hours\nof‘the recent session and should\nprove a warning to him of bow\nutterly unsafe be is wheu*\' in the\nbands of his friends." After nom\ninating two excellent men for the\nvery important position of Assis\ntant Treasurer of the United Slates,\nand receiving declinations from\nboth, the President listened to the\nadvice of Senator Platt of New York\nand at his earnest request nomina\nted. Major William Piimley. By\nways that were dark aud tricks that\nwere vain Mr. Piatt secured an im\nmediate favorable report on Piimley\'s\nnomination and he was confirmed\nby the Senate. Then protests began\nto reaci? the Senate and the White\nHouse against the appointment and\nthe nomination was recalled. Mean\nwhile, Senator Depew who, to his\ncredit be it said kuew nothing of\nPiimley, hastened to assure the\npress that Piimley had his endorse\nment. So strong became the pro\ntects, however, that an investiga\ntion was made aud it was discovered\nthat Piimley was an utterly unfit\nnominee and the President withdrew\nhis name and substituted that of\nboth parties. It was only by acci\ndent however, that the President\nwas saved from an appointment\nwhich must have rcected flseriously\non his administration.\nt\n[Communicated.\nWashington. March :3, 1903.\nSo far as the Cuban reciprocity\ntreaty is concerned, the democrats\nhave won a signal victory over the\nrepublicans. As I said in a former\nletter, it was the intention of the\ndemocrats to talk the treaty to death\nunless they could get all they con\ntended for, and when the republi\ncans saw them line up as one man\nunder the able leadership of Arthur\nPuo Gorman, they capitulated and\ncame down like Scott’s coon. It is\nthe first time in years that the dem\nocrats in the Senate have presented\nan unbroken front to the republicans.\nWhen they have done so in the past\nthey invariably have won a victory.\nThe trouble has been that in the\nrecent past they have bad no lead\nership in the Senate worthy the\nname. They have it now, and the\nresults are apparent to the most cas\nual observer. The democrats said\nto the republicans that they must\nadd an amendment to the Cuban reci\nprocity treaty that would give the\nHouse of Representatives the right\nto pass upon it before it became op\nerative, because it was legislation\nthat affected the revenues of the\ngovernment, and that all such legis\nlation must have the concurrent\nsanction of the House of Represen\ntatives, or else it would not be con\nstitutional legislation. It would be\npractically eliminating the House as\none of the legislative branches of the\ngovernment aud legislation by the\nSenate exclusively. It will be re\nmembered that the House at the first\nsession of the 57th Congress passed\na law giving Cuba this reduction in\nthe rates of the Dingley law that is\nasked for, but it also tacked on to it\na clause that eliminated the differ\nentia) on refined sugar, which would\nsave the consumers of this country\nmillions of dollars annually that now\ngo into the pockets of the sugar\ntrust. For that very reason the\nSenate refused to consider the meas\nure and let it die. It now comes to\nthe front with the treaty, giving the\nsame reduction in the Dingley rates,\nbut it does not remove the differen\ntial on refined sugar which gives the\nconsumer in this country a chance,\nand clearly is an attempt to play in\nto the hands of the sugar trust.\nThe republicans have been forced\nto agree to the amendment to allow\nthe House to pass on the treaty when\nit meets next winter. If they had\nnot agreed to it they would not have\ngot away from here all summer, or\nelse would have been forced to aban\ndon the treaty altogether. The net\nresult of ibis democratic victory will\nbe that the House next winter will\neither add the amendment again,\neliminating the differential on refin\ned sugar, or if it passes the House\nas sect to it by the Senate, then the\ndemocrats in the Senate will open\nup the tariff debate in its entirety\nand consume the whole session in \'\nspeeches that will be made in open !\nsession, and will go to the country -\nss democratic campaign documents. ’\nIn either event the trusts will get j\nit in the neck sod the people will be 1\nbenefited. Score one for the demc- ■\ncrate.\ni* * *\nIt would seem as though the trusts,\nrather than the government of the\nUnited States, were shaping oar\npolicy in the Philippines Islands.\nDespite all the appeals made by the\nPresident and Governor Taft, Con\ngress did nothing towards relieving\nthe economic distress prevailing in\nthose islands. It passed neither\nt currency nor tariff legislation of the\nkind asked for by the commercial\nclasses of the islands. It has pre\nferred to obey the wishes of the to\nbacco and sugar trusts rather than\ncomply with those of the suffering\nmillions of people. This republican\nCongress has been guilty of gross\nj negligence of duty by not passing\nlegislation in the interests of the\npeople of those islands. They are\ncompelled to rely on our good will\nand charity, and Lave the right to\ndemand help of some kind from us.\nBy thus refusing to do anything for\nthe Filipinos this republican Con\ngress has pul a premium on disor\nder and insurrection, and It would\nnot bh at all surprising if the Amer\nican army in the Philippines finds\nitself, before long, busier than it has\nbeen for some time. The policy ol\nimperialism is bringing its own re\nward.\n• • •\nIt is believed here, by the people\nwho ought to knpw, that the recent\nvisit to this capital by J. Pierpont\nMorgan and his cal lon the President\nmeans-an extra session of the 57tb\nCongress and that It will be called\nsome time early in the mouth of Sep\ntember. It ia believed that Mr.\nMorgan said to the President that\nhe and the money kings of Wall\nstreet could nol stave off a pauic\nj longer than September unless there\nj was legislation that would relieve\n■ them. In other words, they want\nthe Aldrich hill passed, so that the\ni money now in the Treasury can be\nplaced iu the banks ol Wall street\nand relievo the pressure on them.\nThus is this administration nol only\nrun by the Wall street gang, but it\napproves a policy that takes the\nmoney out of the people\'s j>ockcts\nand places it iu the banks of the\nj country, so that they can loan it\nback to the people and make a profit\n• out of them.\n! | The remedy is in the bands of the\npeople.\nCharles A.

And, indeed, he was\nwcil and favorably known through\nout the county as a worthy citizen.\nWhen old age rendered him inca) a\nble of following his trade; as black\nsmith, and being alone, having lost\nhis wife a few years buck, he sold\nout and removing to Washington\nwent to live with his son, Matthew,\nwhere be died.

We woo Id recom\nmend that not less than three-fifths\nof the road appropriation be used\nfor permanent work such as grading\nand gravelling.\nWe have visited the County Jail\nand with few exceptions find it in\nfair condition. We notice, however,\nmuch plastering broken in one of\nthe rooms and sj>outing gone from\nthe roof and would recommend im\nmediate repair of same. We would\nalso recommend that two air tight\nstoves be supplemented for the ones\nnow in use.\nWe are unanimously of the opin\nion that a return to the old system\nof Aim* limit* should be made there\nby providing a suitable place for\npaupers ami imbeciles—preventing\nthe recurrence of a ease similar to\nthat of Henry Thomas, who died on\nor about the Ist, I)cc. 1902 in the\ncounty jail) and we are. decidedly of\ni the opinion that all out-pensions\nshould be abolished.\nI We have carefully examined the\nlist of Traders Licenses and find the\nsame correct, with one exception,\nthat of Thomas and Miles, against\nwhom we found indictment.\nWe suggest that a brick walk be\nlaid from main entranceof the Court\nHouse to the stile fronting the same\n, said walk not to be less than six\nfeet wide.\nWo call the attention of County\nCommissioners to the sanitary con\ndition surrounding the Court House\n—which we consider very objection\nable, ami suggest that it be imme\ndiately Iroked after.\nWe have thoroughly examined in\nto the case of the harness cutting at\nJohn Wesley church, and whilst we\nhave not sufficient evidence before\nus at this lime to find an indictment\n—never the less, we are fully satis\nfied that the guilty parties will be\nbrought to justice, and we recom\nmend that the next Grand Jury take\nup the matter.\n1 Wo recommend, however, that\nyour Honorable Court discharge\nWalter Tippett from the recognizance\nnow held against him.\nWe congratulate the sheriff and\nhis deputies in their prompt per\nformance of duty in enforcing the\nprompt attendance of witnesses sum\nmoned by our body.\nHaving concluded our labors we\nsincerely, tender our thanks to your\nHonors —The State\'s Attorney, and\nall officers of this Court for their\nuniform’kindness, courtesy and val\nuable assistance.\ni We do now, respectfully ask to be\ndischarged.

WIBLE.', '(Saint JJanj Beacoq.\n—^ mmmmmm b\nAnimal Md llßseel Wax-Mmken.\nBees are by no means the only\nproducers of animal wax, although\nprobably ninety-nine persons out of\na hundred would say so if asked.\nThe very biggest animal in the\nworld is one of the most important\nwax producers, and a fine wax it is.\nIt is spermaceti, and it is obtained\nfrom the bead of the sperm whale.\nWhen a sperm whale Ips been\nkilled and is brought alongside, the\nfirst thing that the whale men do af\nter the chains are passed around\nthe flukes to bold the big creature\nakwgside the whaling ship, is to cut\nthe bead from the body.\nThis bead alone often weighs sev\neral tons and it is no light job to\nraise it from the water.\ntackles are used and as the whalers,\nwho stand on the whale and on stag\nings rigged over it, cut through the\nvertebrae with their keen cutting\nout spades, other men on the deck\nof the ship heave and haul on the\ntackle until the mighty head is clear\nof the body.\nOften a head like that will be so\nbig that, while {tart of it is still io\nthe water, the tip of the mouth wili\nbe high in the air, as high as the\nspurs of the whaleship.\nThen the whalers begin to cut in\nto the head until they open what is\nknown by thuinus the “case. ” This\ncontains the spermaceti. It is a\nbeautiful clear, whitish fluid, and is\ndipped out with buckets and put in\nto special casks. It is stored away\nin the bold in a separate place from\nthe whale oil, and it brings a good\nprice at all times, for the demand\nfor spermaceti is unceasing.\nThe Chinese obtain a great deal of\nextremely fine wax from a small in\nsect called pela. It lives on trees,\nand the Chinese cultivate the pela\njust as other races breed the honey\nbee. The pela, however, produces\nnothing except wax.\nThis insect produces small masses\nof pure white wax, and it is used\nby the Chinese and Japanese for\nmaking candles to be burned in\nBuddhist temples. The wax is used\nalso for medicinal purposes.\nAnother wax insect lives in cer\ntain districts of India It is not\npropagated as the Chinese pela is.\nbut it produces a very valuable wax\nwhich will be made an urticleof con\nsiderable commercial importance\nsome day.\n•ill Whs Satisfied.\nIt was town-meeting day in Ken\ntucky, as the State elections are\ncalled, and an old man and his son\nbad come down from their mountain\ncabin to Blissvilleto see how things\nworked.\nThe father was rather bashful, but\nthe sou walked around with his hat\non bis ear and seemed to be aching\nfur a fuss. After a while the old\nman approached a small crowd and\nhumbly said :\n“Gentlemen, that\'s my son Bill\notU tbar, and he\'s feelin\' to fout. If\nyou don\'t pay any \'tenshun to him,\nhe\'ll simmer down and get over it.”\n“He can have a fight if he wants\none,” replied one of the men.” —\n“Here, you J you want to run up\nagin anything ?”\n“Whoop! —wboopie, but I do!\'\nyelled the young man in reply, us\nhe got under motion.\n“Hold on. Bill—don’t kill him —\ndon\'t kill him.” shouted the father\n1 as he rushed forward, but be was\ntoo late.\nBilf rushed at the man with his\narms going like flails, and some\nthing bad shot out and landed on\nBill’s jaw and laid him on bis back.\nHe did not get up for ten minutes.\nHe lay so quiet that some thought\nhim dead, but finally he opened his\neyes and sat up, and the father que\nried of the slugger:\n“Mister, what did you do to my\nson. Bill?”\n“I landed on his jaw,” was the\nreply.\n“And he is a licked man ?”\n“He is. He is sighing to go home\nto bis mother.”\n“Yes, he looks like it. Say Bill\nthe airtb has tipped up and Vou are\na licked rip- roarer. last\'s go home\nto ma. ”\nBill slowly got up, looked around\nas if he ha<f lost something, and\nleaned heavily on bis father\'s shoul\nder while the pair walked down the\ndusty highway and never looked\nback. —Boston Globe.\nDanger of Colds and Grip.\nThe greatest danger from colds\nand grip is their resulting in pneu\nmonia. If reasonable care is used,\nhowever, and Chamberlain\'s Cough\nRemedy taken, all danger will be.\navoided. Among the tens of thous\nands who have used this remedy for\nthese diseases we have y<>t to learn\nof a single case having resulted in\npneumonia, which shows conclusive\nly that it is a certain preventive of\nthat dangerous disease. Itwillcure\na cold or an attack of .the grip in less\n■time than any other treatment. It\nlis pleasant and safe to take. For\n| sale by William P. Green well, Leon\nil—■=\nHem Worth Keeping\n“A hen was primarily intended\nto eggs,” remarked Uncle “Ben”\nI Beasley, as be look doe of Sheriff\nt Bailey’s ci fears and borrowed a\nlight. “But do you know, Charles\nI’ve found some hens who through\nill-conditioned circumstance, have\nbeen denied their sovereign prero\ngative and are forced to complete\nwith coarse men iu order to keep\nthemselves out of a Frontstreet mark\net. In short, they hare become so\nvaluable that no amount of fresh\neggs would compensate their owner\nfor changing their occupation.\nThey’ve simply been threatened\nwith annihilation by the present\ncoal famine, and they\'ve met the\nsituation in a manner that makes\ntheir owner resemble a bumble bee\nfrom whom has bdfen taken the last\nruse of summer.\n“Those hens. Charles live out\nnear your old home in Henrietta,\nnot far from Bailey\'s Crossing.\nEver since coal jumped heavenward\nin price my friend, the hen’sowner,\nhas been driven to try every kind\nof game to keep the pot boiling.\nThe warm water for the hen house was\ncutout. The that was\nkept burning in their quarters on\nzero nights was carried into the\nsitting room, and the bens tumbled.\nYes, sir, they canvassed the situa\ntion, and after peeking into the\nempty coal bins through the cellar\nwindows they became, as 1 beard\nmy neighbor\'s boy once express\nit, wise. ’ Then an observer would\nhave noticed that every time a coal I\ntrain rumbled over Bailey\'s Crossing I\n(be gal liliaceous instinct caused those j\nhens to scurry across the road,\nwhen they would line up and watch\nwith yearnniog eyes her precions\ncargo of black diamonds whisking\nby.\n“One afternoon my friend was\nsurrounded by the whole flock. He\nthrough! at first that the cold had\ndriven them mad. Yet they\nted in trying to drive him toward\nthe railroad tracks. At last, to\nhumor them, he gave in and walked\ndown to the cut. There < n the\nground was about half a ton of good,\nhard coal. He was amazed, but be\ning an honest man, be carted it all\nhome, so as to discourage theft in\nhis neighbors, and the next day he\nwatched his hens. Toot!Tool! went\nthe engine, and everv blessed hen\nscuttled across the road to the rail\nroad. And, Charles dauged if every\n\' feathering philosopher didn’t climb\nupon a high-board fence and wait\nfor the train to goby. Now, if there\nis anything uataf heaven that a\ntrainman can’t resist if’s the sight\nof a Plymouth Rock perched upon\nthe top of a high fence. Bang! bang!\nbiff! biff! went the chunks of coal as\nthe cars hurtled by. And every\nben at the first sight of bombarment\ndropped down to the foot of the fence\nwhere they were safe from the mis\nsiles.\n“This maneuver was repeated st\nevery passing of a ooal train. Some\ndays he picks up as much as a ton\nof coal. On poor days he will aver\nage one-quarter of a too. So far\nhe has lost just *one bird, a young\nrooster, who couldn’t resist the\ntemptation to mount the fence, when\nthe fire was the hottest, to give a\ntriumphant crow.\n“And say, Charles it would do\nyo.r heart good to see how mean\nand meaebin’ those hens look when\nnothing but soft coal is thrown at\nthem. Oh, yes, be has more coal\nthan he can . and does quite a\nbasket business with his.”—Roch\nester Post Kxpaess.\nIH>e 111 Mean Hick.\nThere are signsof an existing pro\npensity to constrain the partial with\ndrawal of the word “sick” from the\nAmerican language in favor of the\nword “ill.” Newspapers in their\nheadlines speak of a “very ill man.”\nIt used to be “a very sick man. ” Why\nthe change? “An ill wind” is a\nsatisfactory use of language, but an\n“ill man” grates on the ear and\nsounds like an attempt to improve\non a usage that has no perceptible\ndefect. They say that this new\nwhim is a euphemism imported from\nEngland. A correspondent of a\nBoston paper discusses and disap\nproves it, protesting not only against\nthe use of the unwarrantable adverb\n“illy,” but against the growing use\nof the word “ill" in place of the.\nhomely word “sick.” This Boston\nprotestant, quoting Webster, finds\nthat Shakespeare, with hardly an\nexception, uses “ill” to mean men\ntal, moral, or impersonal disorders.\n“11l at ease,” “HI advised/\' “ill\nbred,” “ill fares,” are all fit and fa\nmiliar uses of a good and industri\nous little word that has plenty of\nlegitimate work of its own to do\nwithout being constrained to figure\nas a feeble substitute for “sick.”—\nHarper’s Weekly.\n• Working Ovortiao\nEight hpur laws are ignored by\nthose tireless, little workers —Dr.\nKing\'s New Life Pills.
