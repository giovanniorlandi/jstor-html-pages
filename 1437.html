They\nnro nt fault, in that they have fail\ned to tluul with hired help and\nrcntrs on a business basis.\nLet us illustrate:\nMr. Thompson, who owns n large\nfarm, takes John Smith ns Iiis hired\nhelp itnd installs him and his fam\nily in a tenant house on the estate\nlie agrees to givo Smith his house\nrent, garden, truck pntch, fire wood,\nnnd cow pasture, with perhnps oth\ner "favors," to gethcr with n very\nmoderate wage for time actually put\nin at work. Generally speaking, this\nwngo is somewhere around a dollm\na day, in some; sections\' of the coun\ntry more.\nSmith works for a year. lie puts\nin possibly two hundred nnd fifty\ndays. At the ciid of that time he\ntnkes stock of his earnings, nnd\nright at this point is -where the\ntrouble comes. Smith can see noth\ning for .his year\'iS work but $250,000.\nHe has come to regard the other\nitems in the contract as "free fav\nors," and consequently values them\nlightly. He hears of his neighbor,\nTom Jones, who has gone to town\nor the city nnd is making good\nwages $2.00 or $2.50 a day. His\nown earnings look too puny to suit\nhim, nnd to town he goes, only to\nfind thnt for the "free favors" he\nhas valued so .lightly in the country,\nthe best part of his earnings in\ntown must be paid. However, he\nhns made the move,\' and rather\nthan be classed as unstable, or un\nreliable, in town he tays.\nIf Mr. Thompson, in contracting\nwith Smith, had said plainly, "Your\nhouse rent" is worth so much per\nmonth, your fire wood so much pei\ncord, your cow pasture so much,"\nand so on through the list of "fav\nors," tho whole matter would have\nworn a very different aspect, and\nSmith would have seen thnt instead\nof being hard his lot was a very\neasy one.\nWhen the employer and help on\nthe farms learn to place their deal\nings .on a sensible business basis a\nbig improvement will be the result,\nand more men will stay on the\nfarms.\nCOUNTY HIGH SCHOOL\nTEACHERS CHOSEN\nAt a recent meeting of the Mont\ngomery County Bonrd of Education,\nProf. M.

Whilo it in\nvery true thnt such a separation is\nsad and painful, yet the main trou\nble is that Senator Beckham spiked\nono of Gov. Stanley\'s 14-inch guns\nwhen ho asked for Col.

It is conceded that James,\nStanley and tho liquor crowd have\nhad a powerful, relentless political\nmachino in the internal revenuo of\nfices and n tremendous advantage\nover Senator Beckham, who has\nbeen their constant target.

Mr. Kruttschnltt\nurged the committee to recommend a\nplan of rcgulatics which will center\nresponsibility for regulation and its\nresults In the federal government, so\nthat conditions affecting both expenses\nand revenues may beTmade subject to\na uniform policy Instead of the waste\nful and often conflicting policies in\nvolved In tbe system of combined state\nand federal regulation.\nWhy Roade Need More Money.\nMr. Kruttscbnitt\'s testimony also bad\na bearing on tbe reasons for tbe appli\ncation of tbe roads to tbe Interstate\nCommerce Commission for a general\nadvance In freight rates. He showed\nthat while tbe price of transportation\nhas declined in rucent years, tbe cqst\nof producing transportation, like the\ncost of almost everything else, bas rap\nIdly advanced. Tblg be illustrated by\nshowing that if freight and passenger\nrates bad Increased during tbe past\ntwenty years in the same proportion a\naverage commodity prices the railroads\nof the United States would have re\nceived $1,034,000,000 more for trans\nportation in 1015 than tbey did receive\nTbls saving to tbe public was effect-\nied. in spite of an increase of 83 per\ncent is the coi of operation of trains,\nby a reduction in tbe average passen\nger rate per mile from 2.W cents in\n1S0."j to 1.1)8 cents In 1015, a decrease\nof 3 per cent, and by a reduction la tho\naverage freight rate per ton mile from\n8.30 mills in 1895 to 7.3 mills In 1915, or\n13 per cent. During the same period\nthe cost of operation per train uiiie\nrose from 92 cents to $1.78, almost\ndoubling. At the same time the aver\nage price of 3-1U commodities enumer\nated In a bulletin of the Department of\nAgriculture Increased 1!5 per cent.\nTransportation Is practically the only\ncommodity in general use that bas not\nIncreased tremendously In price during\ntbe past twenty years, freight and pas\nsenger charges being lower than tbey\nwere twenty years ago.\nBig Saving to Public.\nIf rates had risen proportionately to\nthe Increase in tbe cost of other arti\ncles of ordinary use, Mr. Kruttschnltt\ntold the committee, the average pas\nsenger rate in 1915 would have been\n2.05 cents a mile, or 50 per cent higher\nthan It was, and tbe average freight\nrate would have been 1.21 cents, or GO\nper cent nigner man it was. xne sav\ning to the public in passenger fares\nthrough this difference was $314,000,\n800 and in freight rates $1,340,000,000.\nUniversal railroad bankruptcy under\nthis reduction In rates and increased\ncost of operation, he said, was avoided\nonly by heavy expenditures to obtain\nincreased efficiency In train movement,\nmaking it possible to haul more tons of\nfreight per locomotive. This bad re\nduced tbe average cost of hauling a\nton of freight, but the decline In tbe\naverage freight rate had reduced tbe\nnet revenue of the roads from each ton\nhauled. If the operating costs of tbe\nrailroads, Including the prices of coal,\nlabor and material, continue to ad\nvance at tbe present rate a lot of rail\nroads will be in tbe hands of receivers\nby 1018 unless some relief is afforded,\nMr. Kruttschnltt told tbe committee.\n""Owing to the rise pf commodity\nprices," he said, "the purchasing power\nof the dollar bas fallen 55 per cent and\nthe railroads are in tbo position of be\ning compelled by law to accept pay\nment for their scrvico to tbe, public in\ncurrency worth 45 cents on tbe dollar.\nPublic\'s Chief Interest\n"Tbe public\'s greatest interest Is In\nadequate transportation facilities and\nnot so mucb In low rates. As to most\ncommodities freight rates form a very\nsmall proportion of their cott.\' Ex\ncluding low grade commodities, the\npercentage of the freight rate to the\ncost Is so slight as to offer no Justlflca\ntion for any substantial Increase ii.\nprices to the consumer, It may bo\nMated with little fear of contradiction\nthat tbe consumer seldom, if ever,\nprofits from a lowering of freight rates.\n"Extortlonato charges are a thing of\ntbe past, and under tbe attempt to cut\nrates to their lowest possible figure\ntbe Interest of the wbole public la the\ncharacter and standard pf transporta\ntion is subordinated to the Interest of\nI mm iu ui iuu ijuuiic uuij luai prplHs\n. by lower rates that is to jr, tbe ship-\nfr V A ! l Al a A a AM A Ms4 MAS Al.. 2\nrva tuna icrei?- Pftcui-4 tjut ite gff\nasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaBS(((((st\natssflllllllllllllllHE\nI JbV jJi J i\nm s\'atx\nIbsssssbbbsbibW\n.K.\nBBBBBBBBBBBBBBeSV\nSBB \' BBsl\nV-\'i it --b1\nI BBsfflil V\nMl! ii "\nSSBBBBKaB\' JjiBBBBBBBBK\nA bBBBsbHbH\n1 bbbbbbbbsbbHHSbbI\'\nS SilsSBmBBBBsK\nO IHK VbbbbbbbbbSS 9\nJBBBB BBBBBbL I \'I\nIsbbW bbbbbbbbW 1 3\ngg .BBBBBBBBBB 1 i\'i\nPHf3iflBBBBBBBBBBBBBalic59BBBBBBf \'\nThis frock and hat are examptes of\nthe effect produced by a few inno\nvations along military lines.

Either of them offers a suf-\nflcicnt impulse for the investment.\nThe reasons are, first, Patriotism,\nand, Second, Thrift.\nPatriotism is the expression of\nevery individual\'s obligatbin to the\ncountry which protects him and\ngivosahim the opportunity to devcl\nope his abilities and gain the reward\nof his efforts.\nPatriotism often finds ebulient\nand even hysterical expression, but\nreduced to real terms it is a mut\nter of the obligation of each man\nand womnn to contribute his or hei\nshare for the common good in re\nturn for the advantages gained from\nliving in a well ordered societv.\nThis obligation naturally extends\nto contributing for the common de\nfense. The contribution may be an\noutright gift under a general assess\nment worked out on some presum-\nnlilv pnnitnlilp li.ncic- Rilnli rifk !\ntake tho form of taxes nnd volun\ntary contributions to numerous\ncharities and war organizations.\nThe other obligation is to lend\nmoney to the government as an or\nSomething to\nShow For If\nThat\'s What you get when you invest money in\nDIAMONDS AND JEWELRY\nIn purchasing these you are merely making an in\nvestment upon which the natural increase in value pays\nhandsome dividends.\nForty years of successful and fair business dealings\nis my best guarantee.\nJohn W.

It is\nas much a saving as money deposit\ned in a savings bank. It draws in\nterest at three and one-hnlf per\ncent.; it is n safe investment if\nthe government is stable. If the\ngovernment is not stable then no\ninvestment is safe and property\nrights as well as property values\nwill vanish, as personal safety\nand the right to tho pursuit ot\nhappiness must disappear also\nThere i3 no better investment than\ngovernment bonds. Investment in\nthem is the duty of those who can\nnot enter the army or the navy nnd\nis the discharge of a similar obli\ngation, although it is not regarded\nus heroic.\nTo secure two billions the gpvern\nment must receive an average sub\nscription of $1,000 from each of\ntwo million persons. But the aver\nage will be much below that. If\nthere are Jess than five million sub\nscribersv to the first bond issue, it\nwill be a failure as a test of pa\ntriotism. But if five million persons sub-\n\'\nr . . ,:- , .,-g E\nscribe the average of the subscrip\ntions will be $400. It is obvious,\ntherefore, that a good many thous\nands of people must buy the bonds\nin the small denominations of $50\nand $100.\nThe small amounts should conic\nout of current savings if the loan is\nto attain the great success. Past\nsavings, evidenced by ( credit ac\ncounts in savings bnnks, should bo\nused only to n limited extent Vr,\npreferably, not at all. The funds\nof savings banks, in bank parlance,\nnrc not liquid. They are in the\nform of various kinds, and so com\npose a large part of the fixed capi\ntal of the country. Extensive de\nmand1: on the savings banks would\nforce the liquidation o- these se\ncurities and so dislocate the bond\nmarket and, of course, the money\nmarket. The loan is, therefore, to\nhe subscribed for out of current and\nfuture savings.\nIt is more than likely that busi\nness will bo very good if the loan\nis popularly subscribed. The fac\ntories and mills will be busy pn nil\nsorts of orders from the govern\nment. There is a shortage of all\nninds of biipplies.

And fre\nquently the cost of producing the\nspecimen is out of all proportion\nto the real value.\nSuch a practice should be dis\ncouraged this year.

Too many are content to seek\nprotection through insurnnce, when\ntho sensible course would bo to make\nfire practically impossible.\nThis is not said with any intent\nto decry the business of the insur\nance compnnines, hut rather as nn\naid to them in tho efforts thoy are\nall making to impress upon tho\npeople the great necessity for nde\nquato protection. Contrary to the\nbelief of many people, it is the de\nsire of tho companies that the\nvery best possible protection be\nfurnished, for while reducing the\nrnto and consequent cost of insur\nance, it also practically eliminates\ntho risk, resulting in a decided sav\ning to the companies.\nTho writer has in mind n town of\nabout 2,000 inhabitants thnt, -although\nthere is n river flowing di\nrectly through\' the corporate limits,\nkhas not the faintest approach to\nfire protection. It has a system of\nwater \'works that furnishes water\nfor domestic purposes, but not a\nfire plug or a foot of hose is to\nbo found in the town. This town\nwithin the past fifteen years has\nhad three disastrous fires, each one\nresulting in losses that ran into the\nhundreds of thousands of dollars.\nIts insurnnce rates are as high\nas an angry cat\'s back, ranging\nfrom $1.50 to $3.50 yet its people\nhave persistently refused to install\nan adequate water system. Follow\ning its Inst big fire, which consumed\nan entire block of fine brick busi\nness houses, there were strongJ\nthreats of the insurance enmnnnin1?\nwithdrawing from the town.\nThe town is ideally located, in n\nrich mining and timber country, and\nbut for (he apathy of its citizens\ncould take high rank as a manufac\nturing center. But live business\nmen pass it up, ns they will pass\nup all towns of its class.\nBut the one vital reason why\nfull fire protectoin should be. install\ned is that the unprotected town is\ntho paradise of the fire bug the\nman who regards tho insurance\ncompanies as his best customers.\nMany a bankrupt stock of worth\nless goods has thus been disposed\nof because its owner knew that all\nhe had to do was to start a blaze,\nwhen it would bo impossible to\nquench it.\nOne of the first improvements de\nmanded of any town that would\naspire to a healthy growth is an up\nto date system of fire protection.\nWe are glad to state that Mt.\nSterling has a splendid water sys\ntem and our fire depmtiuenl as\ngood as any city in the state tho\nsize of thisono.\nUNCLE SAM AS A DICTATOR\nTho United States, drawn into tho\nGreat War against its will, may be\ncome tho virtual dictator of the\nworld before tho war is over.

Kcntuckians\nalso gave a good account of them\nselves in tho wnr with Mexico. In\ntho Civil Wnr tho State declared\nher neutrality, but- what could bo\nmore natural when one considers\nthat a Kcntuckinn was at the head\nof each Government.\nAlthough Kentucky took .neither\'\nsidn m the great international con\nflict, nevertheless furnished her\nquota of men, sending more sol\ndiers to tho . Union Army than tho\nStnte of Vermont and more to the\nSouthern side than Georgia.\nIt was a Kcntuckinn who first\nscaled the dizzy heights of Mount\nChnpultepec nnd planted the Unit\ned States flag on its summit; it\nwas a Kcntuckinn, Cassius M. Clay,\nwho led the abolitionists in the\nSouth; it was a Kentuckian who\npostponed the Civil War ten years\nand when tSio elruggie atr last came\nit was a Kentuckian who preserv\ned tho Union.

Tho groans of our\nwounded have hot yet reached oui\nears. Tho casualty lists of our\ndead have not yet been posted. The\nfull force of our sacrifice has not\nyet been felt. But these will come.\nTho United States has to fight its\nwny to liberty by wading through\nblood and every American homo wil\nfeel tho solemn nature of tho deat,h\ngrapple. The world can bo "made\nsafe for democracy" only after a\nyear or more of tremendous sacri\nfice in men and money.\nOur 500,000 army of liberation\nwill fight in Europe; but the real\nfight will bo at home to back up\nthat army with dollars. Every dol\nlar that the people can save from\ncurrent incomo and -from additional\neconomies will be needed.\nNo man is exempt.
