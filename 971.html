He\noffered many valuable suggestions to\nthe farmers and stockmen.\nMany ladies wore out to hear the\npaper read by Miss Harden werper on\n?The Valuo of Domestic Science in\nEucation." Stao discussed the art of\ncookery from a scientitic standpoint\nand threw out many valuable Bug\ngCHtions. Her paper briatlcd witli\nwise sayings tbat held the undivided\nattention of tho audience. After she\nhad takeu her seat, she answered\nseveral questions based upon her\npaper. It is not too much to say\nthat Miss Berdeuwerper scored a de\ncided success.\nDr. P. I}.

Ho illustrated his le-.\'tur\nwith photographs. Like those who\nhad gono before, Di Kennedy held\nthe attention of his listeners to the\nlast. Tho part of his paper devoted\nto animals consumed hi? time and he\nwill speak later on what man lias ac\ncomplished with plants.\nAt tho conclusion of Dr. Ken\nnedy\'s address, Dr. Stubbs spoke\nbriefly on University Extension work\nand tho Institute then took a recess\nuntil 7:30.\nAt the ovening session tho attend\nnnco was larger, many ladies being\niu tho audience ami more farmers\nand stockmen being present.\nProf. J.M. Wilson, who is connected\nwith Agricultural Department and\ntho University of California, and who\nba9 boon studying tho irrigation\npossibilities of Nevada and California\nfor tho !ait few years, was tho llrst\nspeaker. His address was principally\nconfined to tho conditions now exist\ning in regard to tho lack of proper\nirrigation laws in the arid section. As\nau illustration of this, he took up the\nconditions existing in Capay valley\nCalifornia, and showed uy the "water\nhog" of that section in all of his glory\nHis lecture was illustrated with slides\nthat showed the irrigation possibilities\nof tho valley and the ruin that had\nfollowod the general cussed uess of the\n"water liog" who controlled the\nwaters of Clear lake aud Cash creek.\nProf. Wilson\'s lecture was a vivid\nportrayal of tho need of irrigation\nln>vs to control just such conditions\nas exist iu Capay valley and ninuy\nother sections of the arid region.\nProf. Doten followed with an able\naddress on the "Alfalfa Cut Worm"\n? bat did so much damage iu Starr\n\\ ?< v last season. He took up the\nV. ? "i its booming as an egg and\nWi :? sii.iea traced its lifo history\nthrough its various -singes until it\ndeveloped into the full grown worm\nand later iuto a beatiful moth. Ho\nthon took up the various methods\nfor its extermination and showed cuts\nof\'jprs\\uig machines used in soiue\nsections for the extermination of such\nposts. Ho also gave the result of his\nstudy and experiments along the\neamo lines. Ho called upon Mr.\nMcMullcn, Mr. Smiley and Mr.\nCrosson to give tlioir experience with\ntho pests These gentlemen respond\ned heartily and gave the lecturer and\naudience many valuable points.\nTho consensus of opinion heing that\na thorough soaking of the grounii in\ntho fall or early spring was tho most\neffective way to kill the out- worm\nProf. Doten showed by his masterly\nhandling of his subject that he\nthoroughly understood it and tliat he\nhad devoted a good deal of time and\nstudy to it.\n8ATUIIDAY FORKNOOX.\nChnirmun Hardest)\' called the\nFarmers\' Institute to order at 10:30\n. and Uev, George II.

At the con\nclusion of his address ho answered\nseveral questions touching the sub\njoot discussed.\nProf. Doten followed with an in\ntorosting talk on the "San .low\nSonlo."

Prof. Doten showed himself\nmaster of his subject.\n1\'hu concluding paper of the fore\nnoon session was an interesting and\nvaluable discussion of the benefits\narising from certain common bacteria.\nIn this paper Prof. Frandsen gave the\nlocal rnnchera the very latest results\nof ecien tilie research into the struct\nuro and habit* of useful bacteria iu\nsoil and water, lie cleared up iu a\nvigorous way the rather perplexiug\nquestions in regard to the influence\nof such leguminous plants as soy\ntieauB, red clover, lucerue and peas iu\nrouewmg worn out soils. He showed\nclearly that this was only made pos\nsible through the influential action of\nsoil bacteria.\nFollowing up the saine principle.\nProf. Frandsen applied it to those\npeculiar organisms which lead to the\nformation of tho flavors of dilTereut\nkinds -it cheese. lie showed that\nLimbiirger chveeo is uoticeuldy dead\nbut very much alive; so that if wo\n?imply followecd out 1 110 natural\nsuggestions of our nostrils and buried\nthe stuff wo should really bury it\nalive.

The\nlater laws aiming at restri -tion and\ncontrol were rem Iced useless by\ni embodied clauses which contradicted\n| all the valuable provisi -its.

Mr. Henderson\ntraced out from the rudest savage\nbeginnings the progress of agricul\nture, dwelling ou its prime impor\ntance to humanity and its progress i\nfrom lower and ruder methods to the\nmodern ideas.\nlie then dwelt on the marvelous\nprogress of modern times showing\nhow great and wide spread has been\n\'lie influence of the the State Agri\ncultural College snd Experiment\nStations. This address was au unu\nsually logical one, clear ami full of\nthought and dii;nilied force.\nProf. J. M. Wilson was next called,\n(or a continuance of his talks on Ir\nrigation. Ilia special topic was the\n"Irrigation laws of Wyoming." He\ndwelt at length upon the legislative\nenactments of that State, all of which\nprovided for "Justice to all" in the\nheretofore very troublesome question\nof water rights.\nThose talks on irrigation have lieeu\nvery helnful to onr farmers as they\nlinve been full of information, con\ncerning the laws governing irrigation\nand the rights of water holders\nunder these laws.\nMr. Wilson clearly pointed out the j\ngreat deliciencies of our own stat.\nlaws on the subject of irrigation and\nshowed where our existing laws are a\ngreat hinderence to the development\nof our great agricultural industry.\nThe session was suitably conclud\ned l>> an eloquent address by Dr. J.\nH.

The Hesperian eo-n\npauy had iiImi taken the proper\ncourse in drilling a water well as this\nwould ureal ly h sseli the i Xponse of\ngetting the necessary water for drill\nnig purposes As Mr. Phillips has\nhad a ureal deal of experience in the\noil lleids of the country, Ids views on\nwhat the 1 1 cftpcrilili people are doing j\nshould have con>ddf rnhlo weight |\nwith our people.\nMr, Philipps also informed up that j\nhe would begin the or ction of a dor \'\nric< for the well to bo drilled by the\nMiiitic-ola company an soon as tlio\nnecessary lumber arrived.\nSKNATK AM> i* It K.HI DINT.\n\'Hie judications aro that beforo the\nprevent session of Congresa is over\nthere will be a lively clash betweeu\nthe President and the Senate over\nthe plums to be distiiuult-u to the\nfaithful. The coirespondeut of the\nBoston Globe gives the following in\nstance of the President\'s treatment\nof u Republican Seuator wbo had\nsolicited the promotion of a friend in\nthe urmy:\n"A prominent Senator wbo was at\nthe \\V bite House a day or tno ago\nmakes no concealment of bis fei-l\ninjj-1, and is openly telling bts griev\nances. He weut to tbe White House\nto try and secure a promotion iu the\narmy for u constituent. The Presi\ndent, in his somewhat nervous ii"d\nimpulsive manuer, brought his hand\ndown on tlie tublo and told the Sen\nator that political influence would\nuot count in army promotions and\nthat ellioiency would be alone con\nsidered.\n"The Senator said be bad no ob ?\nections to that, but be considered\nthat as a Senator he was entitled to\nbe heard when he recommended the\npromotion of a man from his own\nstate, of whose qualifications and\nabilities he had full kuowledge\nI\'lien he added, somewhat significant\nly: \'You appear to forgot that tbe\nSenate has something to say about\nappointments; that the President\nmay nomiuate, but tbe Senate must\nconfirm.\' The President replied ibut\nbe had uot forgotten. \'The Senator\nanswered that be was glad lo kuow\nI \'bat the President remembered it.\ni and went away. The Senator in\nj talking about the little flurry said\nI that what be objected to was the\nj President\'s manner. He <|iiite\n\' agreed with the President that army\n, promotions should be made on merit\nalone, but he disliked being placed\n! in the attitude of tryiug to secure the\nJ promotion of an unworthy person."\nThen there is another story going\nj the rounds of Washington of how\n| Senator Deboe, of Kentucky, was\n! "tricked" (that is the word used) iu\n| regard to the removal of Collector\nI Sapp, of Louisville. Mr. Oeboo de\n| sired the retention of Collector Sapp,\nj anil he had some argument with\n| which be expected to influence the\ni President. "With this plan in mind"\nj tbe story continues, "be approached\ni the President, iu what was to have\n? been a long aud earnest ii| peal, be\n| ginning with those* unfortunately\nI chosen words. ?! have Collector\nI Sapp\'s resignation in my pocket. .Mr.\nPresident, but -You have!"\nj saiil .Mr. Roosevelt.
