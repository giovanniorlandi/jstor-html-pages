VERNON, ROCKCASTLE COUNTY, KY., FRIDAY, JULY 19. 1918\nNUMBER 43\nmmw\n.i\nv-\nf\n5\nf\n"He Is a Winner"\nJudge J. M. ROBSION\nOF KNOX COUNTY,\nCandidate For Republican Nomination\n.i For Congress\nPaid Advertisement 1\n!ii&X-\'-"i, \'fe \' ""\nWE ARE FOR ROBSfON\n1. Becauso Robsion is a much abler man for the job.\n2. Because Edwards is not and lias not been for tho last sor\noral years a true Republican. The best test Jot a man\'s loyalty to\nhis party is in defeat, and uuder this test Edwards demonstrated\nhis lack of faithfulness.\n3. Because when Powers defeated Edward in 19I0 by\'about\nten thousand majority, Edwards and his newspaper, The Mountain\nEcho, fought Powers and supported Bertram, the Democratic nomi\nnee for Congress, and gave Bertram a handsome majority in Laurel\nthe noma county of Edwards. Tho only county carried by Bertram\nin the district.\n4.\' After Powers had received tho Republican nomination iu\n19I 2 without opposition, Edwards actively assisted-in bringing ut\nSeavy as a candidate against Powers, and he endorsed Seavy und\ngavo him his unqualified support und made speeches for him.\n5. Edwards and his newspapor, The Mountain Echo, bolted\nthe Republican nominees in Laurel County and aided in the election\nof Democrats to county offices, and tho Republicans in Laurel had\nto buy the Mountain Echo to keep it from fighting tho Republican\nparty.\n6 Edwards refused to sign Powers\' petition and has fought\nhim for the last eight years and bolted the Republican party and\nits nominees.\n7. Edwards only n few months bro, urged RnbsJon.to run\nfor Congress and agreed If Robsion would run that ho would make\nspecchos for him, write letters for him, and do all he could for him.\nA few politicians got after him, and he thinks he sees a chance\nto go to Congress, and ho breaks his solemn promise Wo want a\nman. to go to Congress who regards his word as.his bond.\n8. Mr. Edwards Is a double dealer, in that he will not keep\nfaith, violates his promises, hypocritically claims friendship for\nCaleb Powers, whom he has bitterly fought for many years. He\nthereby relinquishes all just claims, to tho respect und confidence of\nhis fellow citizens.\no. He has held twelve years of office at the hands of-the Re\npublicaus and when they would glvo him office no longer, be com\nmenced to fight the party and its nominee. Robsion has been\nfaithful to tho party all his life, but has never before sought offlco.\nThe Good Book teaches us that the reward goes to tho faithful and\nnot to the unfaithful.\nlo. Edwards has not made a speech for the nomineo of tho\nRepublican party sinco I9I0. If ho denies this make him name\nthe time and place whore he spoke for the nominees of the Repub\nlican party, we know ho made speeches for Seavy against Power,\nthe Republican nominee.\nCALEB POWERS\' ONLY BROTHER\nFOR ROBSION.\nBarbourville, Ky., June 22nd, 1918.\nJudge J. M. Robsion,\nBarbourville, Ky.\nMy Dear Judge:\nAs my brother, Caleb Powers, is no longer a candidate\'for\nfor Congress in this district, it Affords\nthat I am for you and will give you my\ntrue, and will mako a record worth while, if sent to Congress.\nOn tho other hand Mr. Edwards refused to sign my brpih\ner\'s pctitjon to get him out of jail, spoke unkindly of him and fought\nhim bitterly all of these years, and after my brother defeated\nEdwards for tho nomination in 1910, his paper, The Mountain\nEcho, and himself 1 am informed, lent their influence and help to\nIB art ram the Democrat, ami Bertram the domocrat carried Laurel\ncounty the home county of Mr. Edwards over my brother by a\nconsiderable majority and I believe that is about the only coifnty\nthat Bertram carried in the 11th district that year. In 19 t2a my\nbrother got the nomination without opposition but I am told Ed\nwards went to Corbin and helped to get Seavy out against him on\na new ticket, und helped Seavy against my brother in the final\nelection. I feel that ho should not claim the friendship of my\nbrother nor urge us to support him against you.\nThe entire Powers family and close friends in this part of the\ncountry, so far as I am informed, are for you and against Edwatds\nWishing you health and success In your race, 1 remain,\nYour friend,\nJohn L. Powers..\nLABOR LEADER FOR ROBSION\nPittsburg. Ky., Juno 26, 19I8.\nMr. J. M. Robsion.\nBarbourville, Kentucky.\nMy Dear Sir and friend:\nYours of June 6th just to hand after some delay as same\nhad been missont, and I was cortainly glad to hear from you.und\nto note you ure enjoying good health, as this leaves mo improv\ning in health sfawty, but I hopa to ho- able to be out at work\nagain in the near future. I was certainly glad to note that you\nwere getting along so well with your campaign, and you certainly\nhavo my best wishes for your success and us you know I can\'t\ntake any hand in politics as our Organization is strictly opposed\nto that, but you will certainly havo my personal support, as I\nknow personally without Any hereby that you have been a friend\nto the miners and mine laborers, and did stand by the miners and\nmine laborers in their struggle last summer, fall and winter, and\nespecially the miners and mine laborers of Knox County, where\nthey had great opposition in their struggle for Industrial Freedom,\nand I know that you did assist in every way that vou possibly\ncould and I am a friend to you because you were a friend to tho\nmlners\'when they needed a friend, and as for mo you can depend\non my personal support. Friendship and best wishes foryour sue\ncess, and I certainly hope that your friendship and as&istance of\nthe past will not be forgotten by the parties that youMjoffcraveiy\nstood by and defended in thoir time- of trouble. w \'-sOwT- -\nWith best wishes for your every success,\nVery truly, \'\nJohn Jeffrey,\nPittsburg, Ky.\nMr. Jeffrey, though a Laurel County man Is strong for\nRobsion. He knows Mr. Edwards and his record and this is why he\nis for Robsion.\nCIRCUIT JUDGE WILLIAM LEWIS OF LAUREL FOR\nROBSION. ANOTHER LIE NAILED.\nMr. Edwards issued a circular to the publ c a few days ago\nin which he states that the voters of Laurel County as a man were\nfor him, and that 1 have been circulating a lie in saying Wm. Lewis\nand other prominent Republicans \'of Laurel wore for me. Now lets\nsee who is telling the truth about this matter. Read the following\nletter from Judge Wm. Lewis. I have tho original in my posses\nsion :\nManchester, Ky., July 8th, 1918.\nHon. J. M. Robsion,\nBarbourville, Ky.\nMy Dear Robsion:\nIn response to your inquiry about the circular letter of Mr.\nEdwards, I assure you that I have authorized no one to say or to\noven intimate that I am not for you, and you need have no fear\nabout my attitude in tho Congressional race. I urged you to run\nand promised to do what I could for you, and you will recall that\n1 have Introduced you on more than one occasion and publicly\npledged you ray support. Of course at tho time I was urging you\nto run and promising to support you I had no thought of Mr. Ed\nwards entering tho race, but there wore no strings tied to my prom\nise. Moreover, I knew Mr. Edwards was nrmnisini? to simnnrt\nyou and acting with me in trying to havo our friends lino up for\nyou, and l never dreamed of his becoming a candidate. I like\nMr. Edwatds. Wo live in London and I have always been his\npersonal and political friend, and hope to remain such, and havo\nopenly and actively supported him heretofore in all his races for\nCongress, and under the circumstances I must confess his enter\ning tliis raco puts mo in somewhat of an ombarrossing position,\nbut it does not justify me in playing false to you and the friends\nthat 1 have urged to support you Before leaving homo I was\napproached by a number of friends about tho circular letter and.\nmy attention called to the fact that it was doing mo an injustice,\nbut I had not been tho circular and didn\'t know what it contained\nbut I now assure you that if there is anything in it that Insinuates\nthat I am not for you, then to that oxtont it misrepresents me, and\nyou are at liberty to say so.\nWith kind personal regards, I am,\nVory,truly yours,\nWm. Lewis.\nTho voters will see after tho election is over how Laurel\ncouuty is not for Edwards. You can also see that Judno Lewis savs\nEdwards and ho urged mo so run and pledged mo bis support.\nWo are going to tho truth.\nfOR THRIFT\'S SAKE\nCLEANUP\nPA I NT UP\nAM D\nKEEP IT UP ,\n"Plenty of paint makes things what they aint "\nsays the eamofluer.\nBUT THERE\'S THE BIG PAINT TRUTH, WITH\nOUT ANY CAMOFLAGE\nPAINT KEEPS THBNGS\nAs They Are\nEvcrp drop of good Paint, properly applied, fills the dry, hungry\npores of the wood, and makes a sealed surface, outside or inside\nthe house, that protects and preserves, and is sanitary\nTHE TAINT BRUSH STOPS THE DETERIORATION OF PROPERTY\nAND THE DEPRECIATION OK VALUES\nS\nPAINT PAINT\nWE CARRY A FULL LINE\nPAINT\nCOME IN AND SEE US.\nW.

Robsion was a good man aud thoroughly qualified to\nperform the duties as a member of Congress at tho time rtdward\nwas boosting him, and he is better qualified now than he was thon\nOn March l$th last Ed wa ids wrote the following letter tr\njudge Tartar.\nD. C. EDWARDS\nLUMBER AMD STAVES\niondon, Ky., March isth, 1918.\nDear Judge Tartar:\nWas glad to hear from you and hope you can land Pulaski in\nthe Robsion Column. ,,,\n1 I think he will carry all counties above Iioro, including Whitley.\nram sorry that all .of our friends are not working together but\nhope most of them are.\nYours truly,\nD. C. Edwards.\nTho Judge Tartar mentioned is the County Judge of Pulaski\nCounty, a former supporter of Edwards, but is now supporting Rob\nsion. This is one of many letters writton to Robsion and other per-sons-.i\nYon will notice that Edwards says on March i3tb, 1918, in\nhi& letter that Robsion will carry "AH the Counties above here in\neluding Whitley." If Robsion could do that over Powers, you\nknow he can do it \'over Edwards. Edwards cannot get half as\nmany votes that Powers would havo gotten".\nHo changed becauso some politician vanted Robsion to sell out\nto them and he would not do so then set about to get Edwards out.\nHe is tho candidate of some dark room politician.\nLIVINGSTON\nThe campaign hero between\nHon.
