AND THE, SMILE THAT FOLLOWS IT., A "Now York Socialist" is credited, in a story that is going the rounds,, with having discovered to bis o*a sat, isfaction a cure-all for the "state of un, rest in the industrial world of Ameri, ca." Whatever the state of unrest in, the industrial world of America may be,, and there is no doubt that it is large, and active, recoct reports from Great, Britain indicate that tbe condition is by, no means confined to this side of the, water. A million and a half of men, and women in England and Scotland, are said to be crying for bread, rioting, in the streets, breaking into stores,, smashing doors and assaulting the per, sons of well ? fed princes, all because, they have no work, and no apparent, hope of securing any. The New York, Socialist is credited with olTering as a, remedy for a continuance of this, con, ditton a systematic reduction of popu, lation, not by slaughter? a method pro, vided by the princes themselves, through war? but by that ounce of, prevention that is better than the, pound of cure. The alleged socialist, has been doing some observing and, reasoning. He finds that in India,, where there are no capitalists or land, lords, there is more poverty than in, America, which indicates clearly to, him that neither capitalists or land,, lords are responsible for undesirable, conditions here. Another fact he notes, about India is that the people of that, land are prolific breeders, as a result of, which the population is increased every, year by millions- This, then, he ar, gues, is the cause of all the trouble. If, the workingman will only quit adding, to his family in time all will be well,, for the population will ultimately be so, reduced as to make it possible for, everyqne who is left to get work at, easy wages., There are two very interesting things, about this story. One is that the ar, gument should be credited to a social, ist, and the other that it should be, traveling about the country from one, newspaper to another under the head, ing, "Novel but Unconvincing." For, it is clear, in the first place, that no, socialist is author of it, since it flouts, the fundamental principle of socialism?, that in the prodigal wealth of nature, there Is provision for all God\'s creat, ures, if the creatures be but permitted, to get at it? and, in the second place,, the argument is less novel than uncon, vincing. It is the revival of the "Mal, thusian theory," a ghastly thing per, petrated more thau a hundred vearsago, by a minister of the gospel to explain, that sin and misery and war and dis, ease were designed by a merciful God, to prevent over population? that the, number of mouths to be fed might not, outrun the bounty of the earth, there, having been in nature no restriction, placed upon the fructifying human, while there bad been upon the product, of the earth? though both came from, Uie same hand., The agonizing world had been asking, the WHY of the agony for ten thousand, years and when the Rev. Mr. Malthus, published his doctrine of horror it was, accepted as such a sure and certain an, swer, that it spread over the world like, the swift blight of a plague, accepted, largelv, almost as a divine revelation,, and for many years went its undisputed, way, justifying every form of evil.
