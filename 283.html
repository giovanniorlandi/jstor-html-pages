Other, | neutrals have been found to take, j their places. The question has been, J asked: What has become of the, ! American field workers of the Com, mission for Relief in Belgium?, I have seen some of them—in, France. They who once had to work, under the German flag, are now, proudly working under the flags of, the two republics. They are inside the, line., One of them, Edward Evre Hunt, the, former delegate for the province ot, Antwerp, is now chief of the bureau, of rehabilitation and relief of the, American Red Cross in France. He, has at least four of his old associates, working in that bureau. L. C. Welling, ton, who used to care for the welfare, of the people of Eille and Valen, I ciennes and the Belgian proVin&e’ of, Luxemburg as representative of the, Commission for relief in Belgium, is, | now- in charge of the Arras district as, j representative, of the American Red, Cross, where he can almost see the, \' very towns for which he cared in Bel, gian commission days. W. B. Jack, son, whose work for the commission, was at Liege, is now deputy for the, Somme district in France. D. S. Mor, gan, likewise at Liege, is with Mr, Jackson. F. W. Meert, an American, whose father was born in Belgium but, became an American citizen, was a, student of medicine at Louvain when, the war broke out. He acted for the, Relief Commission in Brabant. He is, now one of Mr. Hunt’s aids in his Red, Cross work of relief and rehabilitation,, as is J. L. Simpson, whose Belgian ex, perience took him to Vervin, Antwerp,, Liege and Brussels., As time goes on, more of France and, Belgium will be “uncovered” (as Red, Cross workers put it in their unvarn, ished conversations) and the soldiers, ot humanity will advance behind the, bayonets to repair the wreck of war., They will help, not just to keep life, In the inhabitants of FYance and Bel, gium, as formerly, but to make Bel, gium and France whole again—and, more than ever themselves. It is not, a charity they are working—but they, are co-operating with the people of, these lands to make a fresh start, as, the Germans are little by little got rid, of—^nd what a drama it will be when, pome of the American workers actu, ally reach the very places they were, formerly working in under the Ger, man flag—but under the German flag, no more!, ■ ■ ■■■ ., can ran office, IT COB HUES, The following is a complete list of, filings of candidates for office in the, Third division, as reported by the clerk, of court, to be voted on at the forth, coming primary election on April 30, next:, Divisional Ticket, REPUBLICANS, For Delegate—, James Wickersham., For Senator—, Jas.

Why do the free!, men of America fear to talk out in, the open as did their illustrious fore, fathers of the old town-meeting days?, What fool philosophy have we all ac, cepted that we unreservedly dis, posses ourselves of the dearest birth, right that belongs to us; the heritage, that has come down to us from the, good old days of independent think, ing and free speech? These are, thoughts that are of deep concernment, to the profound minds of America,, and the feeling is growing that we, are rapidly becoming contemptible in I, our own sight, because of our mani-j, test cowardice. It is indeed a sad\', commentary on our times., We plead no alibi for ourselves., The press, perhaps, is largely respon, sible for this sory state of affairs, And knowing this, still we hesitate., Our own cowardice confounds us. All, v.e seem able to do is to cry for men, —men who have the courage to do, and say the things that we fear to do, and say ourselves. As one of the most, gifted writers of America puts it:, “To criticize, or not to criticize, that, is the question. Whether ’tls more, patriotic to see an error in the gov, ernment and keep silence, or to voice, The fault openly and have it corrected. !, Remember that silence is sometimes a,, greater falsifier than speech. When, a genuine patriot arises In our midst,, one who seeks a real wrong and gives, it the publicity that means its death,, it is amazing that he should be re, proached for his want of patriotism, or be dubbed a traitor. We need men, of patriotic aggression; we have al, ways needed them. If ever the coun- i, try was in sore straits for a Chamber-\', lain to discover the serious obstruc-j, tion and to remove it so that the Ship, of Fate may slip from the inaction of, the ways down into the sea of inter, national activity it is this very day, and hour. We may well join with the |, poet who cried, ‘God gives us men!’ ”, —♦, CLEMENCEAU, It was many years ago that some, one said of the present Premier of, France that he was “the conscience of, France in print.” That, we think, is, the outstanding characteristic of the, remarkable man who recently, for, the second time, assumed control of, the French government. But strange, as it may seem, Clemenceau through, out his tempestuous career managed, to preserve his conscience without im, pairing his courage. That is why they, call him “The Tiger." Unlike his, contemporaries on both sides of the, Atlantic, his conscience and courage, have flamed together a fever heat,, whereas they might truthfully con, fess: it\'Our conscience does make, cowards of us all.”, True to his profession, the first act, of the Premier when he took office, was to abolish the political censor, ship. He will permit everybody to, say and write whatever they please, about his administration and himself, personally. It is his pronounced pol, icy to allow the French people to in, dulge in honest and well-meaning, criticism to their heart’s content, but, he draws the line on traitors and, their kind. This reversal of the rule, has already had a splendid effect on, the morale of the citizens and prom, ises to work wonders with those sen, timental people. It might be well for, our own authorities to watch the plan, work out. It may be that some of us, will yet be converted to the idea that, it pays to take the people into th, confidence of their government., Clemeneeau is a daring type of man, also he is resourceful. He has e:, perienced so many ups and down, through life that it matters little wha, men say about him. He never m, quired the habit of courting popula, favor and regards high office as prett, much of an ordinary job. In man, respects he reminds one of the cel<, i brated {Tlysses, of whom it was said, .“He was a man of many devices., Hut that we refer to his extraordinar;, resourcefulness; but the famou, Greek was. in keeping with his da;, | and age. inclined to be tricky, wherea, Clemeneeau will not stoop to conquei, -«, THE HUN IS SQUEALING. \', The case is proven that the onl;, way to deal with the Hun is to giv«, him an overdose of his own mediciri\'1, The Germans are now trying to in, duce their enemies to agree to forbk, the use of poison gas for the remain, der of the war. A propaganda ha:, been begun to induce the allies tf, sign such an agreement., The use of poison gas was pronibit, ed by every rule of civilized warfart, when this conflict began. The Ger, mans first used it at Ypres in 1915 on, French and English troops. These, troops were not prepared for an at, tack of the sort, and hundreds of them, were killed with the poison and a con, siderable retreat was nece°=ary. The, English and French then devised ga;, masks, and manufactured various, gases that they threw in front of their, trenches to absorb the poison gas, when the Germans resorted to that, kind Qf an attack., i_,ater tne antes put tneir cnemsts, to work to make poison gases to com, bat the Huns. They found more dead, ly compounds than the Germans had, ever used, and their defenses against, gases are m%-e perfect than the Ger, man., The Hun is now “out-gassed.” The, method of uncvilized warfare that he, devised has been turned against him, to his own loss and he has begun to, squeal. He is crying that he has, enough., The allies should take this for a, lesson. The way to combat Ger, many is to give in kind. The Hun likes, terror until it is turned against hint., Give him a little more of it. It will, do him good and make him have a, kinder regard for the rules of war, fare in the future., -«, Cupid has become tired firing at the, horny-handed miners of Juneau, and, is now using his darts upon the na, tives of that section with gratifying, results.

Due to a few, days of unusual heat last summer, the, navel orange crop of Southern Cali, fornia will be exceptionally light, some, sections reporting not more than 15, per cent of normal., The livestock situation, which a, month ago was very unfavorable be, cause of drought and scarcity of feed,, has been relieved by widespread rains., Precipitation throughout the district,, however, still averages far below the, seasonal normal.

In Southern Idaho feed, is reported as abundant, hay selling, at $9 to $10 per ton, especially be, cause of a winter remarkably open, thus far. In some sections herds have, been considerably reduced by sales be, cause of scarcity and high prices of, feed., Labor is unsettled. Strikes and, threatened strikes have usually re, sulted in so-called compromises under, which there have been substantial, concessions of laborers’ demands., There are, of course, many patriotic, workmen, but the distressing fact Is, rather generally reported that there, is very unpatriotic lack of output per, unit, many of those dominating the, attitude of the workmen appearing to, view the situation as one in which, they may properly seek their sup, posed advantage by rendering leas, service while receiving highest return., A clearer vision would drive home the, conviction that quite regardless of, wage contentions or whether wages, are high or low, their real advantage, lies in greatest output, as that con, tributes most to winning the war and, thus to he safeguarding of their own, freedom., Copper Production, During 191-7 Arizona, the leading, copper state, produced an estimated, total of 687,000,000 pounds, soma, 7.000. 000 pounds less than in 1916., Smelting was hampered by labor, troubles.

NG, FLYING IN FRANCE, American Red Cross, 4 Place «e la, Concorde, Paris, Feb. 8.—Service, with the American Red Cross in, France is a noncombatant service, but, certainly it represents one part of, America\'s war contribution, and it is, not always comfortable service., The Bureau of Reconstruction and, Relief is represented locally in the, liberated regions by "delegates.” The, delegate at H--is one of the older, men in the organization; too old a, man to fight on the firing line (he is, a grandfather!) but not too old to, help * \' Incidentally, the delegate, is a veteran of Hoover\'s Commission (, for Relief in Belgium that kept Amec-1, ica’s flag flying during the darkest, days for our national prestige through, which our nation has yet lived., It is a pleasure to read the reports, the delegate sends to headquarters ati, Paris, reports full of fact, suggestions, I, good cheer, and the statement of ac, complished facts. Just about the\', time the grandfather-delegate was ,, writing his genial, Santa-Claus-llkc, letter aDout Christmas in his part of, France, the first real Christmas since, 1913, a representative of the French, Red Cross in the same region was sit, ting down and writing a letter to the, director of the department of civil af, fairs of the American Red Cross at, Paris. It is interesting for Americans, to know what their French friends, think of our American Red Cross. And, of its delegates * * *, Said the French letter writer, after, thanking the director for bedt£ blank, ets, warm clothes, and dress materials, furnished to the French society for, local distribution:, "We are all very anxious about Mr., J-It really is very dangerous, for him to stay at H—-—- while it, is being bombarded continually. One, bomb came down at less than one, hundred yards from his house. An, other fell, just the other day, nearer, still—but did not explode. Mr. J, I-\'s landlord has left his house, so, that your delegate is staying there all, by himself, without any help—even, that of a servant. His assistants are, in the hospital now, so that he has to, take care of your warehouse all by, himself and to handle all the business, of the American Red Cross for this, distry^without any aid at all. I take, this liberty of writting you this now, because Mr. J-is a treasure to, you and to us and can be trusted for, military no less than for civil relief—, and we’re worried for fear we shall, lose him.”, That is the kind of letter some of, your Red Cross representatives -in, 1 France, are earning by their devotion., Such a one as this delegate of the Bu, reau of Reconstruction and Relief has, elected a kind of work in which he Is, denied the satisfaction of hitting back,, but in which he haS, at least, the satis,, faction”of knowing that he is still, keeping the American flag flying, even as the Commission for Relief in, Belgium kept it flying in Belgium and, northern France during that earlier, part of the war when America was, ’’neutral”—yes, and keeps it flying, even before Uncle Sam gets into that, famous big push to victory!, -• --, The Seward council of defense has, 1 asked for 50 to 60 soldiers to gaiard, the government railroad property, | there, claiming that there are 200, j aliens there, mostly Austrians, wait, I ing for permits to leave the country,, i, LIEUT.
