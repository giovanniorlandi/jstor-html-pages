        <pre>['VOL. 25. NO- 48.\nHIS year\'s big and record\nyield of wheat, corn and oth\ner staples has been heralded\nfar and wide. But there is\nanother harvest that has\nbeen growing and ripening all unno\nticed by government statisticians and\nby everybody else, and that is the\nbumper crop of new millionaires and\nmulti-millionaires. Never before were\nthere so many in New York as there\nare to-day. Millionaires were made in\na night by the great wave of consoli\ndation and the merging of hundreds\nof Industrial enterprises that was the\nfeature of the opening years of the\ntwentieth century, just after the close\nof the Spanish-American war. There\nwere steel kings, steamship kings,\npump kings, kings of car springs and\nof air brakes and of all sorts ot\nthings. They blossomed forth between\nthe sunset of one day and the dawn\nof the next. The select circle of plu\ntocracy widened so swiftly that It\n-*---broke-all barriers and created a new\naristocracy of wealth in America.\nNew York was invaded by a horde"of\nwesterners whose manners in some\ncases shocked even the imperturbable\nservitors at the expensive hotels\nwhere they monopolized the royal\nsuites. Pittsburg, from being simply\na great mill town, a city of grimy\nworkmen, Jumped into world-wide\nprominence because it was discovered\nsuddenly that it had more millionaires\nto the square Inch than any other\nspot on earth. In New York all sorts\nof people achieved fortunes, paper or\nactual, almost before they were\naware jockeys, waiters, bartenders\nand other humble folk glanced with\namaze at the balances with their\nbrokers and began making plans for\nyachts and country houses. The his\ntory of this period was one of the\nwonders of America.\nThen, two years ago, the panic\ncame and put a dampener on the\nfinancial hopes and aspirations of those who had\nsurvived the various ills that followed in the wake\nof industrial over-expansion. But since the panic\nclouds have cleared away there has come another\nand even more wonderful appreciation in values,\nthe most remarkable advance in the prices of all\ncommodities and securities that this country has\never known. Probably more millionaires have been\nmade in the last 12 months by the steadily rising\ntide of tremendous prosperity than history ever\nhas recorded in a similar period of .time. The\nnumber of those who have grown rich quickly is\ngreater, probably than it was in the time of mer\nger and consolidation, nearly a decade ago. Be\nfore the panic of 1907 there were, perhaps, 3,000\nmillionaires in New York. Now there are any\nwhere between 5,000 and 10,000.\nThe advances in the value of securities in the\nlast two years have been almost incredible. There\nprobably are more than 100,000 persons who are\nstockholders of United States Steel. In October,\n1907, Steel Common was 21% in February, 1909,\nit was 41% this October it has been well above\n90. The shares of the Pennsylvania railroad are\nmore widely distributed than any other transpor\ntation line, more than 60,000 people being listed\non its books of shareholders. Two years ago it\nwas 103 lately it has been above 150. Union Pa\ncific is next to Pennsylvania in the length of its\nstockholders\' list. It is not only one of the most\npopular investment securities, but also one that is\nspeculated in most largely. Union Pacific com\nmon was 100 in 1907 this year it has been above\n219, an increase of more than 100 per cent. New\nYork Central, Southern Pacific, Baltimore & Ohio,\nAtlantic Coast Line, Illinois Central, Great Nor\nthern, Standard Oilpractically all the stocks In\nthe long list of railways and industrials have ad\nvanced from 50 to 100 or more per cent, in value\nsince October, 1907.\nThousands of people who are not speculators\nand who are intolerant of speculation have profit\ned enormously by this wonderful rise in prices.\nThey are the ones who bought for investment\nwhen the prices were low and who are now reap\ning the harvest. During the panic enormous\nblocks of gilt-edge shares were thrown on the\nmarkets when great speculators like Heinze and\nMorse, and some others who were not so spectac\nular or daring, had to sacrifice anything and ev\nerything for ready money. Their holdings now are\nscattered throughout the country and have been\ntucked away in tens of thousands of safes and\nstrong boxes.\nWhile some of the new millionaires come from\nhe ranks of those who were bargain hunters in\nthe days of panic, most of the new plutocrats are\nfrom the army of speculators.\ni There are SQ many of these new millionaires\nthat it would be Impossible to list them all indi-\nvidually with any degree of accuracy. Compara\ntively few of the old band of millionaires have\nfailed to add materially to their fortunes since the\npanic. There are some, it is true, who were more\nor less disabled in those days, and the period that\npredeced them who hav^e not succeeded in win\nning back their lost money and prestige some\nwho were in the ill-fated trust companies, others\nof" the insurance crowd, and so on. But those\nwho held on and were able to weather the storms\nhave been lifted up and now are richer than ever.\nNot only that, but a large number of new groups\nof great financial strength has been developed.\nThere is the Hawley group, for instance, which\nhas made millions and millions in the rise in val\nues of railway shares. Edwin Hawley, the head\nof this coterie, was not a big Wall street figure\nuntil within the last year or so, but of late he has\nadded immeasurably to his wealth and to his pow\ner as a transportation king.\nAmong those of his friends who have climbed\ninto the chariot of the plutocrats is Frank A. Van\nderlip, the president of the National City bank.\nHe is reputed to have made more than a million\nout of Chesapeake & Ohio and Union Pacific.\nWhen he was assistant secretary of the treasury\na few years ago Vanderlip was a man of very\nmoderate means and lived in a modest little flat\nin Washington. After he came to New York his\nwealth increased somewhat, but only since the\nfirst ofv this year has he entered the millionaire\nclass.\nAnother of the Hawley group who is one of the\nnew crop of multi-millionaires is a banker named\nScott, who piled up a small fortune, dollar by dol\nlar, in Richmond, Va., and who has increased it\nmany fold of late in Wall street. Still another of\nthe same group is Robert Fleming. He was not a\npoor man when the rise in stocks began, but he is\nsaid to be a very rich one now. Then there is a\nnew crop of Union Pacific millionaires, Southern\nPacific millionaires, Wabash, Rock Island and\nmany other groups of new millionaires who have\nbecome wealthy by^the tremendous upturn of the\nshares they were interested in. Some of these\nmen were millionaires before the beginning of this\nyear these have now moved up to the multi\nmillionaire class.\nThere are quite as many who have won for*\ntunes in the field of industrial stocks, especially in\nUnited States Steel common. One of thesemore\nthan a millionaire when he began buying Steel\nis Frank A. Munsey, the publisher. He is said to\nhave started his Steel purchases two years ago,\nwhen the stock was around 22, and to have accu\nmulated a total of 100,000 shares at very low\nprices. His winnings are estimated at more than\n$6,000,000.\n-7 These instances, taken at random, give an Indi\ncation of the thousands of fortunes that have\n$m. $& Defective Page\nST. PAUL AND MINNEAPOLIS. MINN* SATURDAY. NOVEMBER 27, 1909.\nsprung up lately through the up\nward sweep of prices in Wall\nstreet. Great corporations, like the\nfire and the life insurance com\npanies, have also profited stupen\ndously. These tremendous reser\nvoirs of money own huge blocks of\nshares in scores of railway and in\ndustrial companieslots of from\n10,000 share td "almost a control\nling interest. The most of these\nare sober, gilt-edged, dividend-pay\ning stocks that have not been spec\ntacular in their advance in price as\ncompared with some of those that\nhave gone up like skyrockets. Yet\neven these high-priced shares have\nbeen enhanced in value from 20 to\n50 per cent, in the last 12 months.\nThey were bought at panic prices,\nso the published records of these\ncompanies show, and these institu\ntions now are said to be selling\nthem off, cautiously and carefully\nat the fancy figures that have been\nprevailing of late. Unlike the in\ndividual investor, they believe in\ncashing in their winnings and salt\ning them down until there Is an\nother chance to buy cheap.\nIn the commodities there are new\ngroups of millionaires and multi\nmillionaires also. Some of these\nhave won their wealth in wheat,\nothers In corn, but most of them in\ncotton. There are more new cotton kings and\nprinces to-day than ever before. Practically all of\nthese are southerners, who have had an expert\nknowledge of this staple. Most of them have been\ncotton planters themselves on a large scale, and all\ntheir lives they have been studying cotton, its\ngrowth and its ever-widening markets.\nAlmost every day there have been rumors fly\ning about as to what Patten was doing in cotton.\nBut curiously enough there has been never a word\nsaid about the real bull leader in the cotton mar\nket, the man who has been the biggest speculator\nin this staple, and who recently has jumped into\nthe multi-millionaire class, Eugene G. Scales of\nDallas, Tex. Scales is the most towering bull,\nprobably, that the cotton market ever has known.\nPatten is a piker beside him. Even the celebrated\nMr. Sully in his palmiest days never operated on\nsuch a huge basis as Scales has been in the last\neight months.\nThis new and mighty multi-millionaire in the cot\nton market has steadfastly kept himself in the\nbackground. He is no amateur speculator, how\never, for five years ago he was in one of the Sully\ncampaigns and retired from the fight with several\nlarge dents in his financial armor. But now he\nhas won back all his losses and a lot more.\nSome among the many others who "know cotton"\nand have won big fortunes through its rise in price\nare Fergus Reid of Norfolk, Va: Morris H. Roth\nschild of Woodville, Miss. William P. Brown of\nNew Orleans and Louis S. Berg of Mississippi.\nBerg had charge of the Chalmette terminals at\nNew Orleans not long ago and was a hard-working\nrailorad man. A little later he pieced together a\nlot of small Mississippi railroads and combined\nthem into an effective and profitable system. Then,\nwith a modest fortune, he came to New York, and\n.since then has been making money out of cotton.\nAnd so the list runs on. Hardly a name among\nthe thousands of new millionaires is familiar to\nNew Yorkers. They are practically unknown out\nside of the small communities they came from in\nthe west and south. They live in the costliest suites\nin the most expensive New York hotels. Next\nsummer, if they have no setback they will begin\nleasing or buying palaces at Newport, Bar Har\nbor or other places where the socially elect are\nsupposed to live. Then they will begin trying to\nbreak through the imaginary inclosure with which\n"society" surrounds itself. There are so many of\nthese new millionaires that perhaps like the incur\nsion of a new race they will overwhelm and con\nquer the relatively small group of people who have\nbeen priding themselves on having their wealth for\na decade or more. At any rate, the names of most\nof these new millionaires probably will be read for\nthe first time in print in the next year\'s books of\nsocial registry, which form the nearest approach to\nthe directory of the peerage that the plutocracy of\nAmerica knows.\' 1\nTALK S JJEM\nEmployed to Stimulate Indus\ntries, Says Hattie Willliams.\nActress Says Good Looks Are Asset In\nBusiness and Scouts Idea That\nUgly Women Are Most\nUseful.\nPhiladelphia."This Is the age ol\nbeauty in the business world," says\nHattie Williams, the star of "Detec\ntive Sparkes," now playing at the\nGarrick theater.\n"Mark me, I do not mean the beau\ntiful age, but the age of beauty. We\nhave come to the time when a sweet,\na piquant, a bewitching face Is quite\nas Important a factor in legitimate\nbusiness as price or quality of wares,\nconvenience of mart or effective ad\nvertising.\n"Womangood-looking womanhas\nat last found a sphere of honest en\ndeavor that cannot but appeal to her\nthe legitimate exploitation of the\ngoods she is paid to show off. Paris\nled the way in this new field of en\ndeavor and Philadelphia has rapidly\nfallen into line.\n"Next to the French capital I know\nof no city where the fairness of its\ndaughters is so effectively used for\nhonest business purposes.\n"Let me explain. Let us walk down\nChestnut street. We drift along with\nthe stream of shoppers until that\nstream becomes jammed in front of a\nbig show window. There in the win\ndow sits a girl of surpassing fairness.\nHer beautifully shaped head, crowned\nwith a wealth of glossy black hair, is\nbent over a new model sewing ma\nchine. She is intent on her work and\nwe are intent on the picture she\nmakes. It is probably a very fine, up\nto-date sewing machine, but it could\nstay in that window for many weeks\nand not attract a crowd.\n"The man whose business it is to\nsell that machine knows his business\nand knows it well. The combination\nof girl and machine is a pleasing one\nand the impression is lasting.\n"Further down the street there is a\nshop with big windows, through which\nwe see heaps of confections, and we\ncan see, too, a dainty blonde miss 01\nexquisite feature and coloring who\nseems to have little in the world to do\nexcept to sit just where the passing\nthrongs can get glimpse of her fresh\nloveliness. Why is that store crowded\nwith customers while another confec\ntionery shop further down the street\nlanguishes for want of trade? The\nsweets in the one shop may be no bet\nter than those in the other, but the\nattractiveness of the blonde saleswom\nan furnishes the one thing needful In\nbusinessthe initiative.\n"In these days of greatest competi\ntion among merchants, it was a clever\nman indeed who first realized the tre\nmendous attraction of a pretty wom\nan\'s face for shoppers, women as well\nas men. For, don\'t for a moment think\nthat the potency of these fair young\nwomen is felt only by the opposite\nsex.\n\'Bertha, the Beautiful Sewing Ma\nchine Girl,\' can go on hiding her beau\nty in the dusty factory, where it\nseems, after all, she has had a hard\ntime of it, but if Bertha is really so\nbeautiful she can be happily prosper\nous by giving legitimate publicity to\nher fresh, wholesome charms. And\nthat\'s what many Berthas are doing\nto-day in Philadelphia, and it\'s a good\nthing all\'around. It won\'t spoil Ber\ntha if she\'s the right sort of girl, and\nwon\'t hurt the shopping public to look\nupon bright, pretty faces."\nPhosphorescent Forests.\nThe phosphorescence of certain\nagaries of Borneo has more than once\ndemoralized the superstitious natives\nand astonished whites. Some years\nago a party of English engineers\nfound it necessary to survey a tract\nof low lying country which was al\nmost Impenetrable, and to blaze the\ntrail natives were employed to work\nat night, others during the day. The\nformer came into camp one night\nstating that they could not go through\na portion of the bush or forest, strange\n"spirits" on the trees telling them that\nevil would befall them if they con\ntinued. The "spirits" proved to be a\nmagnificent display of phosphores\ncense* emanating from agaries\' grow\ning upon the dead limbs of the trees.\nThese vegetable fire bodies were\ntraced for a considerable distance,\nproducing a most remarkable exhibi\ntion, the light in some places being so\nbrilliant that it was difficult to be\nlieve that the forest was not afire. To\ntest the brilliancy the men held pa\npers near the most brilliant protions\nand read by the light.\nSAYS CANNON MUST QUIT\nVictor Murdock Predicts Trouble for\nMan Who Serves Notice on\n"Uncle Joe."\nKansas City, Mo.Some one in the\nnext session of congress is going to\nhave a mighty unhappy ten seconds in\nthe company of Speaker Cannon.\nMen who reviewed the future here be\nlieved that about ten seconds would\ndo, and they were equally certain that\nthe particular visit to the sacred cham\nber would be made by some one es\npecially certain was Victor Murdock of\nthe Seventh Kansas congressional dis\ntrict.\nThe most disagreeable job in the\nworld,is waiting for some member of\nthe\' Cannon machine in the house,"\nftvir.

He was not a\npoor man when the rise in stocks began, but he is\nsaid to be a very rich one now. Then there is a\nnew crop of Union Pacific millionaires, Southern\nPacific millionaires, Wabash, Rock Island and\nmany other groups of new millionaires who have\nbecome wealthy by^the tremendous upturn of the\nshares they were interested in. Some of these\nmen were millionaires before the beginning of this\nyear these have now moved up to the multi\nmillionaire class.\nThere are quite as many who have won for\ntunes in the field of industrial stocks, especially in\nUnited States Steel common. One of thesemore\nthan a millionaire when he began buying Steel\nis Frank A. Munsey, the publisher. He is said to\nhave started his Steel purchases two years ago,\nwhen the stock was around 22, and to have aeon\nmulated a total of 100,000 shares at very low\nprices. His winnings are estimated at more than\n$5,000,000.\nThese instances, taken at random, give an indi\ncation of the thousands of fortunes that have\n4\niiMfciV^-*^\nsprung up lately through the up\nward sweep of prices in Wall\nstreet. Great corporations, like the\nfire and the life insurance com\npanies, have also profited stupen\ndously. These tremendous reser\nvoirs of money own huge blocks of\nshares in scores of railway and in\ndustrial companieslots of from\n10,000 shares td ^almost a control\nling interest. The most of these\nare sober, gilt-edged, dividend-pay\ning stocks that have not been spec\ntacular in their advance in price as\ncompared with some of those that\nhave gone up like skyrockets. Yet\neven these high-priced shares have\nbeen enhanced in value from 20 to\n50 per cent. In the last 12 months.\nThey were bought at panic prices,\nso the published records of these\ncompanies show, and these institu\ntions now are said to be selling\nthem off, cautiously and carefully\nat the fancy figures that have been\nprevailing of late. Unlike the in\ndividual investor, they believe in\ncashing in their winnings and salt\ning them down until there is an\nother chance to buy cheap.\nIn the commodities there are new\ngroups of millionaires and multi\nmillionaires also. Some of these\nhave won their wealth in wheat,\nothers in corn, but most of them in\ncotton There are more new cotton kings and\nprinces to-day than ever before. Practically all of\nthese are southerners, who have had an expert\nknowledge of this staple. Most of them have been\ncotton planters themselves on a large scale, and all\ntheir lives they have been studying cotton, its\ngrowth and its ever-widening markets.\nAlmost every day there have been rumors fly\ning about as to what Patten was doing in cotton.\nBut curiously enough there has been never a word\nsaid about the real bull leader in the cotton mar\nket, the man who has been the biggest speculator\nin this staple, and who recently has jumped into\nthe multi-millionaire class, Eugene G. Scales of\nDallas, Tex. Scales is the most towering bull,\nprobably, that the cotton market ever has known.\nPatten is a piker beside him. Even the celebrated\nMr. Sully in his palmiest days never operated on\nsuch a huge basis as Scales has been in the last\neight months.\nThis new and mighty multi-millionaire in the cot\nton market has steadfastly kept himself in the\nbackground. He is no amateur speculator, how\never, for five years ago he was in one of the Sully\ncampaigns and retired from the fight with several\nlarge dents in his financial armor. But now he\nhas won back all his losses and a lot more.\nSome among the many others who "know cotton"\nand have won big fortunes through its rise in price\nare Fergus Reid of Norfolk, Va. Morris H. Roth\nschild of Woodville, Miss. William P. Brown of\nNew Orleans and Louis S. Berg of Mississippi.\nBerg had charge of the Chalmette terminals at\nNew Orleans not long ago and was a hard-working\nrailorad man. A little later he pieced together a\nlot of small Mississippi railroads and combined\nthem into an effective and profitable system. Then,\nwith a modest fortune, he came to New York, and\nsince then has been making money out of cotton.\nAnd so the list runs on. Hardly a name among\nthe thousands of new millionaires is familiar to\nNew Yorkers. They are practically unknown out\nside of the small communities they came from in\nthe west and south. They live in the costliest suites\nin the most expensive New York hotels. Next\nsummer, if they have no setback they will begin\nleasing or buying palaces at Newport, Bar Har\nbor or other places where the socially elect are\nsupposed to live. Then they will begin trying to\nbreak through the imaginary inclosure with which\n"society" surrounds itself. There are so many of\nthese new millionaires that perhaps like the incur\nsion of a new race they will overwhelm and con\nquer the relatively small group of people who have\nbeen priding themselves on having their wealth for\na decade or more. At any rate, the names of most\nof these new millionaires probably will be read for\nthe first time in print in the next year\'s books of\nsocial registry, -which form the nearest approach, to\nthe directory of the peerage that the plutocracy of\nAmerica knows:\n-J tkP "K-\n#& wy&ti!\nST.

We\nhave come to the time when a sweet,\na piquant, a bewitching face is quite\nas important a factor In legitimate\nbusiness as price or quality of wares,\nconvenience of mart or effective ad\nvertising.\n"Womangood-looking womanhas\nat last found a sphere of honest en\ndeavor that cannot but appeal to her\nthe legitimate exploitation of the\ngoods she is paid to show off. Paris\nled the way in this new field of en\ndeavor and Philadelphia has rapidly\nfallen into line.\n"Next to the French capital I know\nof no city where the fairness of its\ndaughters is so effectively used for\nhonest business purposes.\n"Let me explain. Let us walk down\nChestnut street. We drift along with\nthe stream of shoppers until that\nstream becomes jammed in front of a\nbig show window. There in the win\ndow sits a girl of surpassing fairness.\nHer beautifully shaped head, crowned\nwith a wealth of glossy black hair, is\nbent over a new model sewing ma\nchine. She is intent on her work and\nwe are intent on the picture she\nmakes. It is probably a very fine, up\nto-date sewing machine, but it could\nstay in that window for many weeks\nand not attract a crowd.\n"The man whose business it is to\nsell that machine knows his business\nand knows it well. The combination\nof girl and machine is a pleasing one\nand the impression is lasting.\n"Further down the street there Is a\nshop with big windows, through which\nwe see heaps of confections, and we\ncan see, too, a dainty blonde miss oi\nexquisite feature and coloring who\nseems to have little in the world to do\nexcept to sit just where the passing\nthrongs can get glimpse of her fresh\nloveliness. Why is that store crowded\nwith customers while another confec\ntionery shop further down the street\nlanguishes for want of trade? The\nsweets in the one shop may be no bet\nter than those in the other, but the\nattractiveness of the blonde saleswom\nan furnishes the one thing needful in\nbusinessthe initiative.\n"In these days of greatest competi\ntion among merchants, it was a clever\nman indeed who first realized the tre\nmendous attraction of a pretty wom\nan\'s face for shoppers, women as well\nas men. For, don\'t for a moment think\nthat the potency of these fair young\nwomen is felt only by the opposite\nsex.\n\'Bertha, the Beautiful Sewing Ma\nshine Girl,\' can go on hiding her beau\nty in the dusty factory, where It\nseems, after all, she has had a hard\ntime of it, but if Bertha is really so\nbeautiful she can be happily prosper\nous by giving legitimate publicity to\nher fresh, wholesome charms. And\nthat\'s what many Berthas are doing\nto-day in Philadelphia, and it\'s a good\nthing all\'around. It won\'t spoil Ber\ntha if she\'s the right sort of girl, and\nwon\'t hurt the shopping public to look\nupon bright, pretty faces."\nPhosphorescent Forests.\nThe phosphorescence of certain\nagaries of Borneo has more than once\ndemoralized the superstitious natives\nand astonished whites. Some years\nago a party of English engineers\nfound It necessary to survey a tract\nof low lying country which was al\nmost impenetrable, and to blaze the\ntrail natives were employed to work\nat night, others during the day. The\nformer came into camp one night\nstating that they could not go through\na portion of the bush or forest, strange\n"spirits" on the trees telling them that\nevil would befall them if they con\ntinued. The "spirits" proved to be a\nmagnificent display of phosphores\ncenser emanating from agaries\' grow\ning upon the dead limbs of the trees.\nThese vegetable fire bodies were\ntraced for a considerable distance,\nproducing a most remarkable exhibi\ntion, the light in some places being so\nbrilliant that it was difficult to be\nlieve that the forest was not afire. To\ntest the brilliancy the men held pa\npen near the most brilliant protions\nand read by the light.\nDefective Page\nSAYS CANNON MUST QUIT\nVictor Murdock Predicts Trouble for\nMan Who Serves Notice on\n"Uncle Joe."\nKansas City, Mo.Some one in the\nnext session of congress is going to\nhave a mighty unhappy ten seconds in\nthe company of Speaker Cannon.\nMen who reviewed the future here be\nlieved that about ten seconds would\ndo, and they were equally certain that\nthe particular visit to the sacred cham\nber would be made by some one es\npecially certain was Victor Murdock of\nthe Seventh Kansas congressional dis\ntrict.\nThe most disagreeable job the\nworld,,is waiting for some member of\nthe Cannon machine in the house,"\nMr. Murdock said.

Every train brings new\napplicants, and every part of the Unit\ned States is already represented by,\nthose who have found marriage a\nfailure.\nThe new Nevada divorce law is,\nperhaps, the most elastic ever entered\non the statutes of any state. It was\nenacted by the legislature to attract\nimmigration and money to the state\nin the popular belief that every new\narrival would make more or less of an\ninvestment in the vast mining and\nother industries of Nevada. The plain\ntiff must reside in the state for at least\nsix months. He or she need not live\nthere continuously, but may leave the\nstate, at any time, returning and fil\ning suit when six months have passed\nafter legally establishing a domicile.\nHere is what a Reno divorce special\nist says in a treatise on the procedure\nrequired: "While the laws in other\nstates generally contain some provi\nsion for the dissolution of the mar\nriage tie, it is obvious that in cases\nwhere extveme cruelty, desertion and\nfailure to provide form the basis of\nthe grievance, the laws in such states\noffer no substantial relief to the ag\ngrieved party because the require\nments of proof, duration of offense,\nCourt House at Reno.\ncorroboration of the plaintiff and pro\ncedure under court rules are so exact\ning and irksome that the desired re\nlief sought by the applicant is rend\nered impossible of attainment, and the\nclient, when consulting local counsel,\nis almost invariably advised that he\nhas no remedy. In Nevada the appli\ncant, without deception or fraud, upon\nalmost any charge from which lack\nof harmonious relations may be rea\nsonably inferred, may apply to our\ncourts and secure prompt results by\ndecree of absolute divorce, valid and\nbinding in law."\nUpon the passage of the new law\nNevada promptly succeeded to the\neasy divorce crown that formerly char\nacterized South Dakota, the people of\nwhich state one year ago made its\nrequirements harder and the time of\nrequired residence one year. It need\ned only the filing of suits there by\nsuch well-known persons as Nat Good\nwin, Margaret Illington (Mrs. Danieji\nFrohman) and others of stage circles,\nwith the consequent wide advertising,\nto cause a stampede in that direction\nof hundreds, many of whom married\nat leisure and repented in haste.\nReno is a city of 18,000 population,\nacting as a supply center to the vast\nmining areas of Nevada, and being the\nsite of the State University, the Mac\nkay School of Mines, a big Carnegie\nlibrary and other institutions. It is\nknown as the city of the finest\nchurches and homes in the state. It\nhas every modern equipment in the\nway of paved streets, traction service,\nwaterworks, lighting, etc. Not only\nis it a center of intellectual attain\nment and wealth, but it is a railroad\ncenter and of climatic and scenic note.\nIntersecting it is Nevada\'s most beau\ntiful mountain stream, the Truckee\nriver, on which the government is\nspending millions, and surrounding it\nis the richest agricultural land of that\nregion.\nWith all these and other advan\ntages Reno immediately grabbed the\nlarger part of the divorce industry.\nNoted Old Tavern Still Standing.\nThe old Whitney tavern in Shelby\nMile, Tenn., erected in 1810, is still in\na good state of preservation. It is\nbuilt of cedar logs, which are chinked\nand pointed between, and with the\nexception of the renewing of the\nweather boarding and shingles it has\nundergone no change. The large stone\nchimneys, with their broad fireplaces,!\nare still in as perfect condition as\njwhen Gen. Jackson and other noted\n|personages were entertained there.\nX,ater it was occupied as a residence\nby Thomas Holland.\nin the days of overland travel com\nmodious stables were kept in connec\ntion for the purpose of taking care of\nthe horses and vehicles of the guests,\nalso the stage coaches which ran be\ntween Nashville and southern points\nin Alabama and Mississippi.Chris\ntian Science Monitor.\n1 ^-4\n1', 'sn^E\nmkmitmttiaimhtm\n4 ff\nTHE APPEA\n4 NATIONAL AFRO-AMERICAN NEWSPAPER\nPUBLISHED WBEKIiT\n*AMS BROS.

Christ, no God\'s image in\nman, no value in the sacraments, no\nnothing.\nThe Doctor saj\'s that his new reli\ngion will have nothing supernatural\nabout it, but a child can see that it is\nsupernpturally nonsensical.\nThe Doctor is a most pronounced in\nfidel and shows upon*every occasion\nfor instance, when he recommend5\nByron Manifred and Shelley\'s Beat\nrice CeCnci, both of which are chock\nfull of the most revolting immorality.\nThey are both as unclean as Manon\nLescault or Rousseau\'s Confessions\nUnder a proper construction of the\nlaw, neither Manifred or Beatrice Cen\nci is transmissible through the mails.\nTHE TITANIC STRUGGLE AGAINST\nWHITE SUPREMACY.\nAmong the most interesting litera\nture to be found in the great dailies\nare the letters of such globe-trotters\nas Mr. Frederick J. Haskin, who is\ngathering much important informa\ntion as to doings all over the world.\nIn a recent letter Mr. Haskin says:\n"In 1908, last year, the immigra\ntion into the Amur, according to offi\ncial Russian figures, was more than\n600,000, and the total for this year is\nexpected to be 750,000. This means\nthat in less than four years Russia\nhas placed almost 2,000,000 settlers in\nthese undeveloped provinces, and the\nwork is proceeding at such a rate that\nten years will find 5,000,000 Russians\ndomiciled here. That means that Rus\nsia will do in ten years more than\nEngland has done in Australia in a\ncentury in the matter of building up\npopulation."\nThe interpretation which Mr. Has\nkin places upon the above is as fol\nlows\n"In this triangular fight for the con\ntf \'\'*\'\'\'ijfeiliflgjfegl\ntrol of Manchuria, this great empire\' gerat as is asserted by the medical\nHON.

A\ngreater Jappn, a Japan the captain of\nAsia leading the titanic struggle\nagainst white supremacy on earth,\nmeans the doom of Russian dreams."\nThis "titanic struggle against white\nsupremacy" is going on all over the\nworld and as capable officers and statesmen I\nas any of them.

It is the testimony\nof the railroads of the country to the\nestablished fact that in certain lines\nof industry, the Afro-American has no\nrival.\nAfro-Americans, Japanese, Chinese,\nwhite women and Jews have long\nbeen among the tabooed classes, and\nif these were not eough to be segre\ngated, now comes the city of Wash\nington and strives to enroll that chiv\nalrous bird the rooster among the un\ndesirables. The complaint against\nthe rooster is that he blows his trum\npet too sonorously and at untimely\nperiods, thereby disturbing the repose\nof drowsy citizens. THE APPEAL is\nuncompromisingly upon the side of th\nrooster in this controversy just as it\nwas on the side of the Jewish maidens\nwho were tabooed by the "finishing\nschools" of that city. The rooster is\nan Asiatic by descent, and, of course,\nhas some 4siatic characteristics, but\non the whole^ is a pretty decent sort\nof a fellow/ THE APPEAL would\nnot give one\' rooster for a regiment of\nC\'astellanes and Don Miguels.\nThe hookworm is monopolizing, at\npresent, as much attention as the\nCook-Peary and Jackson-Jeffries con\ntroversies.

There is|\na scene of genuine grace and fascma-f\ntion between the hero and heroine,\nwho are deeply in love with each\nother, several episodes between the\nstenographer and the clerk, and most\ninteresting incidents. But the spc\ntacular and thrilling effects are the\nthings that most attract and entar\ntain the audience. The pictured com\nmunication by wireless telegraphy be\ntween an ocean steamship, rolling and\ntossing and pitching in a cyclonic\nstorm, and a yacht supposed to be\nwrecked unon a reef manv miles away\nis intensely dramatic. The producer\nwho is a wizard in designing mechan\nical effects has made this production\nwith its many novel effects, one of\nthe biggest successes that has been\nseen in years. This is the same pro\nduction that was produced at the Lib\nerty Theatre, New York.
