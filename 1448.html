The air from tha av\nenue stirred the lace that screeneththe\nopen windows and made the blooAing\nmarguerites in great high tubs about\nthe room move on their fragrant sfems,\nIt was barbarously early\' fordityper,\nbut ridiculously late for luncheon,but\nit had suited the mood of the maiftind\nthe maiden who had met by accident\nand had been spending a delightfully\ntinchaperoned day in town. Besides\nthat therewere trains to be taken back\nto a fashionable resort, where brrak\nfasts. luncheons and dinners made Such\ninformal meetings as this quite impos\nsible. So, as the girl said, it wassail\nthe more fun. They were not even\ndressed for dinner and the head waiter,\nwho was punctilious in such matters,\nglanced somewhat disapprovingly at\nthe girl\'s ltnen shirt waist and.her\nbamboo hat with a pouf of blue, tilted\ndown over her brows.

A small East Indian man\npicturesquely iurbaned and robed in\nwhite came toward their table bearing\na chafing dish upon a silver tray from\nwhich he served them noiselessly with\n■ rice and chicken while a waiter poured\nwine into two pale greenish glnsSes.\nThe service had all the dignity and\nimportance of a rite.\nThe girl\'s face took on a look Iff in\ntense satisfaction ns she tasted the first\nmorsel. As her sun-kissed hands moved\nover her plate the man thoughtjtbat.\nshe was one of the few women whfl ate\ngracefully. As a rule, they wepe too\nnonchalant or too enthusiastic;. But\n1his girl’s appetite had all the,regres\nsion of a Duse. *\' 1 ■\n“Isn’t it funny ?” she said. \' p\n| “Funny?”\n“Why. of course, it’s too funny for\nanything! To think of our meeting,\nby accident, of all places, at chimch!\nTell me—why do you go to church?”\n“To kill time, I suppose. Thelf the\nmusic there is admirably good and the\nsermons—” «\n“Admirably short!”\nj “Exactlyl Why did you go?” .\n“I always go. It’s become a babit\nwith me. But it is the very last place\n1 should have expected to see yoifc It\nis a remarkable coincidence thal we\nshould have drifted there. Don’t you\nthink things happen oddly at times?”\n“What kind of things?” *\n“Coincidences—for instance?” *\n"Please don\'t call our meeting a mere\ncoincidence. I call it the result of an\neducated mind wave.”\nMind wave? to\n“Yea—a brain current.

I gave one a run once,\nthough.” f\n“Oh, how perfectly lovely! Tell me\nabout it.”\n“It wouldn’t Interest you. You see,\n1 was running first."\n“Ha! ha! ha!”\n“Funny, wasn’t it? Well, in Igdia.\nwhere they live on this sort of thing—\nrice and chicken—”\n“And sauterne?”\n“Er—well—no animal food—you un\nderstand—they get their souls eulti\nvated to such an extent that they.can\ncommunicate with each other a*ross\nlong distances.” •\n"Anybody can?”\n“Oh, you must be educated up to it.\nAn American doesn\'t take to it ns\nquickly, but the natives believe 4n It.\nIt is a part of their religion. They can\nperform all sorts of magical trices. I\nhave no doubt that the man who tjjpoks\nthis—the little chap in the turban—\ntalks without words.”\n“I noticed he didn\'t speak. A^d do\nyou know—as he moved about do still\ntond quiet—I felt—felt—” S\n“Jarred?”\n“No—chilled—just as though Ijpverc\ntinder a spell. He has such mysterious\neyes. Did you notice?”\n“Never notice men’s eyes. Wattle of\ntime.”\n“Ha! ha! ha! I wish he would come\nIn again!”\n“He probably will.”\nHush!\n-What?”\n“Oh—here he comes! He has another\ndish.”\n“Good!” »\n“Don\'t let us pretend to^otiSet f Yes,\ncs you were saying. I quite agree’with\nyou, that the day has been a pleasant\none—but what would people think if\nthey came in and found us dini% to\ngether—at five o\'clock.

She must he\nperfectly willing to walk miles on golf\nlinks, whisk uncomplainingly to the\nbox seat of n coach, eat welsh rabbit\nat midnight without a protest, keep\nthe extra young men of her protege\namused while a particularly favored\nadmirer is being put through his flir\ntation paces and pedal the autoinatio\npiano playing machine when neces\nsary.\nOf course, it stands to reason (hat a\nchaperon who tills to perfection nil\nthese requirements is something of a\nsarft bird\', yet. she remains the sum\nmer girl\'s ideal, while as a matter of\nfact chaperonnge in thia present year\nof grace threatens to be practiced by\nspecialists only. There is, lor Instance,\nthe golf matron, who knows how to\nsit on a shady clubhouse balcony,\nbrew tea and mind a dog and young\nman at the same time that she effectu\nally keeps her eye on ner enarge by\nmeans of a powerful field glass. Then\nthere is the yachting duenna and the\ncoaching and automobile chaperon,\nevery one quite perfect in her own\nway, and at a seaside resort these\nseasons one chaperon added to her\nlaurels and possibly to the onerous\nduties of her sister professionals by\nplunging in and rescuing from tie\ngreedy waves the pretty girl who wa*\nunder her care.\nHam Cakes.\nChop fine equal quantities of cole*\nboiled ham and bread.

VV. Wood, of Madison, I* the\npossessor of a valuable diamond ring\nwhich lias quite an interesting history,\nSU.vm the iiioux Falla (H. D.) Argus\nLeader.\nAbout a year and n half ago the ring\ndisappeared. The house was searched\nfrom top to bottom, the ash heap was\nplacer-mined and every nook and cor\nner of the premises thoroughly Inspect\ned, hut the jewel seemed to have re\nturned to Its original home In South\nAfrica or Hrar.il. As time went on Mr*.\nWood gradually forgot her loss.\nWell, as sometimes happens in every\nhousehold, about n year aftpr the dis\nappearance of the jewel Mrs. Wood sent\na bedstead to a second-hand store to be\nsold. A farmer named- Merriam, liv\ning several miles from Madison, was\nthe purchaser. The bedstead was\ntaken to his home in a farm wagon and\nplaced in position for use. The other\nday a brilliant object In a eraek of\nthe panel of the licdstcad attracted the\nattention of Mrs. Merriam, and, pluck\ning it out. it proved lo be a diamond\nring in all its dazzling beauty.\nThe Merriams, Instead of keeping\n♦ heir discovery quiet, ns many would\nbe tempted to do, commenced a search\nfor the owner. They visited the store\nwhere they had purchased the bed\nstead, and were informed that the bed\nstead with the diamond setting had\nbeen the property of Mr. and Mrs.\nWood.\nThey called on Mr. Wood, and whert\ntip had been informed of the object\nof their visit he stated that he believed\nhe had> "heard somethin#" about hia\nwife bavin# lost a diarnon^Pring a year\nor two ago. The jewel was given to Mr.\nWood, who rewarded the farmer and\nhis wife for their honesty. He wore\nthe ring home on his finger and ate\ndinner without attracting Mrs. Wood’s\nattention to it.\nAfter dinner, while he was ini\ngurnent over the C hinese war and trfak\ning many sweeping gestures, Mrs.\nWood caught right of the ring, and rood\nhastened out to tell her neighbors of\nher good fortune. It was Mrs. Wood\'s\ncustom to take off her diamond ringe\nat night and place them under her pil\nlow to prevent them from falling into\nthe hands of burglars should any of\nthe light-fingered gentleman enter the\nhouse. The ring evidently slipped from\nit* place under the pillow to thecreviee\nIn the panel of the bedstead, where it\nremained concealed for a year and a\nhalf until accidentally discovered by\nthe farmer\'* wife.\nSo far as is known, the first botanical\nexperiment ever performed was con\nducted by a Dutchman. He placed in\na pot 200 pounds of dried earth, aDd- in\nit he planted a willow branch, which\nweighed five pounds. He kept the whole\ncovered up. and doily watered the earth\nwith rain water. After five years\'\ngrowth the willow was again weighed,\nand was found to have gained 164\npounds. The earth in the pot was dried\nand weighed, and had lost only two\nounces. The experimentalist, there\nfore, looked upon this experiment as\nsupporting the theory that plant* "re\nquired no food but water. But he was\nwrong. Later it was discovered that\nmuch of the increase in weight of\nplants was derived from carbonic acid\ngas in the air.— V. V. Herald.\nThe First Putleal.
