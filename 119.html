Cisel in\nthe Journal of Agriculture. The nsual\nmethod used on earth roads is to rake\ndirt from the roadside and pile it into\ni mudhole. forcing the water to some\nother location, where a uew mudhole\nwill be formed. No attention Is given\nthe side drains or the draining of the\nroadbed. Water is permitted to How\nacross the road from trash filled side\ndrains and to destroy the roadbed by\nsoaking beneath it.\nWater is the most destructive thing\nwe have to contend with in keeping\n•good roads. It Is the enemy of all\nKXAMl-iiK OF A BAD COUNTliJf HOAD.\nroads and particularly earth roads.\nGood drainage is the first thing to be\nconsidered in building roads. Money\nspent in getting rid of the water that\nreaches the roadway is well . spent\nRemove all water quickly which\nreaches the surface of the road and\nintercept the flow of water from high\ner grounds. If it must come into the\nroad have side drains of ample size to\nhandle the water at all times. Turn\nthe side drains Into the first water\nchannel that can be reached that re\nmoves it from the road. The mistake\nis often made of trying to carry the\nside drains a considerable distance to\nfavor some landowner when it could\nbe turned aside at perhaps one-half the\ndistance. This causes a heavy volume\nof water to\'form, more than the drain\nis capable of carrying. The result ts\nthe road is much damaged by overflow\nwhen it could have been prevented by\niving the water a quicker outlet.\nMost country roads are too flat to\nshed water. In fact, many of them\nare concave, owing to the fact that\ntraffic is kept consistently in the een\nter and \'wears down the surface until\na ditch Is formed. The water follows\nthis concave eeutor, washing here and\nforming ponds there, causing the road\nto become soft and give way. The\nonly remedy is to give the*road suffi\noient crown, enough to cause the water\nto qnickly drain to the side ditches\nAll side ditches should be of ample\nsize, to provide for the greatest volume\nof water that may be expected by rea\nson of heavy rains or melting snows\nA wide, shallow ditch Is best, and it\nmust be kept clean of grass and trash\nIf the side drains are constructed right\nthey can be kept in perfect shape I\nuse of the road machine.\nThe side drains and surface drain\nage will care for the surface water\nBut there Is hnother way in which wa\nter reaches t.he roadbed. Underflow\nwater, following a layer of hardpnn\nor bedrock from some point higher\nthan the fhad, on reaching the level\nrises to the top. making the road al\nmost like quicksand. These currents\nof water flow slowly and will keep the\nroad In a horrible condition long nfter\nother sections have become dry. The\nouly way to remove this underflow wa\nter is with drain tile put beneath the\nroadbed and leading to a good outlet\nwhich many times It is difficult to find\nThis underflow water is very destruc\ntive to any kind of improved road, as\nIt will couie to the surface through any\nstone or gravel road and so weaken\nthe crown that it soon gives way\nMany miles of otherwise fine roads\nhave proved expensive failures because\nprqper drainage was not mafic before\nrpek and gravel were P»t down It is\nn wash? <>f money a id labor to build\nimproved roads without first thorough\nly draining the right of way.\nPatrol System In Iowa.\nThe patrol system of maintenance\nhas been adopted in Clayton eortnty.\nla. The duty of the patrolmen will be\nto keep the roads in passable condition\nat all times. Each patrolman must see\nthat his stretch of road is woll drag\nged. fill in the low places and repair or\nreport any bridge or culvert needing\nrepair. He may also be used on per\nmauent grading or surfacing work\nwhen it is deemed advisable by the\ncounty board or engineer It is csti\nmated that the cost of maintaining\nroads b.v this method will average $9C\nper mile..\nBRICK BUILT ROADS.\nIn\nThey Are Cheaper Than Macadam\nthe Long Run.\nTwo summers ago, says a writer In\nthe New York Sun. I beard a Connect\nicut state engineer who had served\nthe state for eighteen years declare\nthat it was uot the automobile that\ndestroyed the roads, but rather imiier\nfect coustructiou. Macadam roads have\nbeen proved most wasteful and mil\nlions of dollars\' worth of them are\nblown away by the wind each year,\nfiudiug lodgment under fanners\' prod\nuce and in gardens. It is not the first\ncost of such roads that counts, but the\nupkeep. It is now generally conceded\nthat the Toad of the future will be\nbuilt of some hard material, such as\nvitrified brick or concrete.\nWayne county, Mich., has construct\ned mauy miles of qpocrete road. I\nhave examined many of these which\nhad been laid four years and find that\nthey are most safe and durable. Con\ncrete, like brick road, provides a non\nslipping, mudless and dustless surface,\nthe ideal condition. Cuyahoga county,\nO., in which Cleveland is situated, is a\nood example of brick roads, and these\nare uow being extended to suburban\ntowns connecting Akron and Canton\non the south and Paiuesville on the\neast These have proved very satis\nfactory. I have seen brick roads in\nTerre Haute and Anderson, Ind., that\nhave been laN for over twenty years,\nand I believe that hard brick making\nhas improved since tliat time.\nIt would seem then that if the cost\nof brick or concrete was three or four\ntimes higher than macadam construc\ntion the two former pavements would\nbe much cheaper. The eternal digging\nup of the road is a nuisance, and wa\ntering or plastering with oil is a nui\nsance. Stone roads are brutal, but\nsome cities, such as Cleveland and\nNewark, N. J., still tolerate the Bel\ngian block on the main streets. Such\npavements are dangerous, noisy and\ndestructive to vehicles and horses.\nThose that have charge of road build\ning had better make up their minds\nnow that the road problem of the\nfuture will be largely based upon mo\ntor traffic, and roads should be built\nwith this In view.\nt\nt\nT\nX\nT\n*\n?\n4*\nWORK ON THE MERIDIAN ROAD\nOver $500,000 Expended For Permanent\nImprovements In 1913.\nAccording to a recent statement by\nPresident John C. Nicholson of the\nMeridian Road association, over $500,\n000 was expended for permanent im\nprovements on the Meridian road in\n1013, and in 1914 there will be spent\nat least an equal amount.\nThe Meridian Road association was\norganized at Saiina, Ivan., in June.\n1911, for the purpose of establisiifcig\na highway from Winnipeg, Canada, to\nthe gulf of Mexico and bringing abolit\nits construction and maintenance.\nThe route of the Meridian road as at\npresent established extends across the\ncountry approximately north and south\nns far as Waco, Tex., the principal\ncities it liasses through being Grand\nPorks and Fargo, N. D.; Watertown\nand Yauktont S. D.; Norfolk and York,\nNeb.; Saiina and Wichita, Ivan.; Enid,\nOklahoma City and Lawton, Okla.,\nand Fort Worth, Tex. At Waco the\nroute divides, one branch bearing east\nerly to Houston and Galveston and\nthe other westerly through Temple,\nAustin and San Antonio to Laredo.\nTile road is practically level over most\nof its length, and it is stated that very\nsoon, if not now, a car can be sent\nover the entire length on high gear.\nIt is stated that it is now a first class\nearth road for more than 1,500 miles,\nar approximately three-fourths of its\nentire length.\nThe present officers ot ttie associa\ntion are: President. John C. Nicholson,\nNewton, Iv/\\n.; vice president, D. E.\nColp, San Antonio, Tex.; secretary and\ntreasurer, Robert Campbell. Anadarko.\nOkla. There are -the following divi\nsions. each having a president and\nsecretary: Canadian. North Dakota.\nSouth Dakota. Nebraska, Kansas, mil\nitary and Texas. The Texas division\nis further divided into seven divisions.\na\n"Good Roads" Day In Iowa,\nin order to interest school children\nin good roads the highway commis\nsion of Iowa and the state superin\ntendent of public instruction are rec\nommending that the superintendents\nof consolidated schools set aside one\nday each year in the latter part of\nApril or the first part of May as a\n\'good roads" day. It is recommend\ned that each school have its own\n"good roads - \' day, as it would lie im\npossible for the state highway com\nmission to properly assist in the work\nby the arranging of exhibits for a\nlarge number of schools ou tlie same\nday. It is also recommended that the\nday be spent in studying the new high\nway laws, in the preimrarion by stu\ndents of papers on features of high\nway work and in the study of the ex\nhibit of enlarged road and bridge\nviews from the collection of the Iowa\nhighway commission and the United\nStates office of public roads. It is pro\nposed to devote the evening of the\nsame day to a general good roads pn\ng\'ram and a lecture by a represent.\'!\ntive of the highway commission.\nH i i I F i \'- X - i - H - H - M - H "\nAUTOIST AND FARMER.\nA good road means comfort\nand pleasure for the autoist It\nmeans the same thing for the\n„ driver of a farm wagon, with |\n4 much economy added. |\nt THREE A \'S IS FOR TOWN\nt ROADS.\nT "The A.

But we do not\nbelieve that the township, unit\nshould receive road \' assistance\nfrom the central government"\nCONVICT LABOR ON ROADS.\nPlan of Working Prisoners Is Proving\nSuccessful In Several States.\nThe plan of working convict labor on\nthe roads, which was given a trial on\na small scale ju\'Illinois last fall, prov\ned so successful that more trusted in\n■nates of the state penitentiary will be\nused on the roads this spring and sum\nmer. There are 250 prisoners in the\nJoliet prison who are to be used on the\nroads. Arrangements have been made\nwhereby the couuties wanting help\nwill pay 50 cents each for the use oi\nthe men, but none will be sent to work\non less thau five miles of road. It is\nplanned to divide the men into five\nsquads of fifty each, so that five com\ninunities may be served at once. The\nstate agrees to furnish the rock for\nmacadam roads provided the couuties\npay the freight on it from Joliet to tin\nnearest railway point\nTexas has decided to try the use of\nconvict labor on the public roads with\nout guards or shackles Governor Col\nquitt has made a contract whereby\nfifty convicts were sent to Smith coun\nty. in northwest Texas, to work the\nroads radiating from Liudale in what\nis known ns road district No. I which\nrecently issued $75.000 of bonds\nI .literal appropriations to permit th*\nemployment of convicts on the high\nways of New York state are recom\nmended by the state commission of\nprisons in its annual report to the leg\nislature More than 400 convicts were\nso employed at various times during\nthe past summer and fail by order of\nthe superintendent of state prisons with\ngratifying results, both from the view\npoint of the state and the convicts\nthemselves, the commission states.\nFollowing the resolutions adopted by\nthe state automobile association at\nPortland, plans are being mapped out\nwhereby Maine will adopt the con\nvict system of road labor now used in\na number of other states. It Is felt\nthat this would save the state much\nmoney, give the prisoners outdoor la\nbor and increase the speed of road\nwork.\nGOOD ROADS DAY.\nState of Washington Sets a Date In\nLatter Part of May.\nCity men are to be asked to coutrib\nute with pick and shovel to the better\nment of highways all over the state of\nWashington this year when the third\ngood roads day is observed, probably\nMay 23 or 24. the exact date not yet\nharing been named. Governor Er\nnest Lister has approved the proposa\nof the Washington State Good Road.\nassociation Shat lie issue a proclama\ntiou setting aside if good roads day\nami the association is already at work\nupon plans to\'make it the most effe*\ntive one yet held.\nUnder the leadership of the Wash\nington State Good Roads association\nit is planned to effect a state wide or\nganizatiou reaching every hamlet and\nschool district, as well as the larger\ncities. The various good roads asso\ndations, commercial, clubs, chambers\nof commerce and automobile dubs will\nlie lulled upon to take the Initiative\nWhile it is realized that it will be tin\nItossihle to get all the city folk out\ninto the country, it is Imped that they\nwill ohsemve the occasion of cleanui\nday in their neighborhood.\n.

Hold\na large glass in the other haud aad\nhave some one pour water into it until\nyou think it weighs about as much as\nthe pillow. Then weigh the two and\nsee how far out of the way you are.\nOr take a cap in one hand and put in\nthe other as_many coins as you think \'\nmay be needed to balance it. You will\nfind your judgment far from correct.\nTake two stone jars. Fill one with\nhot water and the other witli cold and\nask a friend to say which is the heav\nier of the two. The I Kittle with hot\nwater will seem 25 per cent heavier.\nTake three articles weighing the\nsame. Put one on the ground, one on\na table and one on a high shelf. Ask\na friend to lift them and determine\nwhich of the three is the heaviest. He\nwill pick the one on the shelf as the\none which weighs the most every time.\nThe laws of illusion in weight arc\nquite exact and it is marvelous to see\nwhat a large proportion of people will\nmake exactly the same mistake in ex\nactly the same way. Thus the pillow\nseems lighter than it is because Its ap\npearance suggests lightness. Of two\nsimilar weights the one that is tlie lar\nger in size will always seem the light\ner. That is why the weight of the cap\nwill be underestimated in the expert\nment just described.\nAny change from normal tempera\nture, either hot or cold, will appear to\nincrease the temperature. A piece of\nice the same weight as a glass of wa\nter will seem to weigh twice as much.\nThe extra exertion needed to sustain\nthe Yveight of an object cither above or\nbelow our natural reach seems to make\nIt heavier, and for this reason the\nweight on the shelf will seem to have\nthe advantage.\nDoes this show what poor judges we\nore? Not at all. It only proves our\ngood judgment. It Is like the sad case\nof the college student in a class on op\ntics who could see through the illu\nsions. so that matters which appeared\ncrooked to the rest of the class, al\nthough they were really straight, ap\npeared straight to him.

H. SCANLAND, Editor and Proprietor\nBENTON, LA., THURSDAY, JULY 30, 1914.\nLEADERSHIP.\nIt cannot always be said of the leader, as\nit has been of the poet, that he is born, not\nmade. There are, of course, born leaders\nlike Washington, Jackson, Calhoun, Clay,\nBenton, Yancey, Toombs, Breckinridge\nJefferson Davis and the peerless R. E. Lee\nrecognized instinctively and followed im\nplicity, but there have also been leaders, of\na secondary rank, to be sure, who have be\ncome such by slow toil, patient persistence\nand gradual acquirement of the requisite\nqualities. The really great leaders have\nbeen born so—leadership originally was\nself-ordained. The recognition of leader\nship is found not only universally through\nout mankind, but among the higher orders\nof animals. It first became essential for\nattack and defense as between rival tribes\nand clans, and when the social organism\nbegan to develop was indispensable to\nfashion and direct it. Primarily it was\nbased chiefly on the possession of physical\nprowess. As organization become perfect\ned and effective to compass its ends leader\nship came to depend more on cunning,\nsupplementing and controlling physical\nstrength and the power of numbers, until\nat least it fell under mastership and guid\nance of will power and the higher intellect\nual qualities.\nEvidently any sentiment, theory or pur\npose to become effective must find embod\niment in a person capable of giving it ex\npression and of concentrating behind it the\nfull force of all its advocates; of inspiring\nthem with zeal for its success and with\nconfidence in his ability to bring it about,\nand of bringing opposing forces into har\nmony with it or overcoming them.\nKingship used to mean leadership, but\nit does so no longer. With one or two con\nspicuous exceptions political leadership has\nexisted by popular choice, and, while that\nchoice is sometimes mistaken, it must be\nsaid that, as a rule, the selections of the\npeople have been good ones. They have\nrealized that the only way to get things\ndone is through leaders, and they have\ngenerally designated superior men for the\nwork. There is evident now, however, in\nsome directions, a disposition to believe\nthat the world would get on better without\nleaders, and to get rid of them. Hitherto\nprogress has been attained by the compell\ning guidance of superior personalities,\nsuperior not by any artificial human dis\ntinction, but by natural endowment. The\nattempt is being made to organize society\nin such a way as to eliminate the ineqali\nties growing out of this natural order.\nSocialism proposes to carry on not-only\ngovernment, but the great processes of\nproduction, manufacture, exchange and\ndistribution, by meansof machinery which\nwill recognize no difference in the capacity\nor any individual in his reward. All incen\ntive to individual excellence will be remov\ned and all recognition and compensation\nfor superior ability and industry denied.\nCaptains of industry will be unknown And\nevery social unit be compelled to remain on\nthe same dead level.\nNeedless to say that with no possibility\nopen to any one beyond a living, on exactly\nthe same scale of every one else, progress\nwould come to a standstill.\nGrowth under leadership, which is Na\nture\'s method, with its prizes for the com\npetent and the deserving, has given us\neverything we have that is worth having\nand promotes the steady improvement of\nthe race. The fittest come to the front and\nsurvive and pass on their good qualities to\nposterity. Notonly so, but if we look at the\ngreat industrial and commercial ieaders of\nto-day in this country we shall find that\nthey are not where they are by accident, or\nby favoritism, but by force of their own\nqualities. Almost every man prominent\nnow in commerce and finance began life\npoor, showing that, despite all the complaint\nand discontent, this is a land of exact\nequality of opportunity for every one—that\nnatural leadership, the outcome of superior\nqualifies, prevails, and when the vast and\ngrowing beneficence of those who have\nbeen conspicuously successful is consider\ned it cannot be said that they have failed\nto recognize their obligation to the social\norder which made their success possible.\nA glance at history will show that every\nthing of moment, everything of advantage\nto the race, whether reached by military\nforce and the agency of governent, or by\nintellectual achievement, has been under\nthe direction and inspiration of capable\nand worthy leadership, and instead of at\ntempting to discard it we should recognize\nand cherish it, whenever it appears, and\nyield ourselves to its guidance.\nFUSS AND FEATHERS.\nJohn Marks of Assumption, and W. T.\nPeter(out)son and other Bull Moosers in\nthe Third Congressional District are happy\nand are rheumattically trying to dance a\njig of joy and to sing a song of gladness\nover the desertion of a number of broken\nspirited Democrats and disconsolate poli\nticans who were none too hopeful, and are\nproclaiming from the housetops that they\nintend to break the solid Democratic Con\ngressional delegation of the State by cap\nturing the Third District next November\nand at the next general election gobble up\nthe entire State. This " great-Republican\ninfluence-in-Louisiana " talkissuch an old\nstory it has crow\'s feet around the eyes.\nFor years they have kept their ears to the\nground, listening with bated breath to hear\nthe echo of an earthquake and the annihi\nhilation of the Democratic party, with the\nbarren result only of the plaintive bleat of\na handful of shelf-worn Democratic de\nserters. The Republicans of the Third\nDistrict, who are masquerading as Pro\ngressives, are due such a walloping next\nNovember that it is a heard-hearted man\nwho can deny them this mouldy crust of\ncomfort of the political " blow-out" they\nare now enjoying.\nBased on the amount of income tax col\nlected from individuals in one district of\nNew York City, it has been estimated that\nthe total of the incomes received in that\ndistrict from about 15.000 persons amounts\nto $1,000,000,000, or $66,667 for each per\nson. The district is in lower New York,\nand comprises about two square miles of\nManhattan Island. It is regarded as the\nrichest region in the world, of the same\nsize. Adjoining it on the east and north\nis a region of one square mile on which\n600,000 people live; but very few of these\npay income tax, few of them enjoy secure\nincomes. It is the most populous region\nin the world. .\nIn to-day\'s issue of the Banner will be\nfound a card from Hon. Andrew Currie\nannouncing his candidacy for membership\non the Board of Equalization for Louisiana.\nMr. Currie, who has filled the position of\nMayor of Shreveport with honor to himself\nand satisfaction to his ccnstituênts, is a\nworthy representative of the Democray of\nthis State. He is honest and capable—one\nof those Democrats of the old school upon\nwhom the party should be glad to bestow\nhonors. _\nIt is a matter of regret that many Lou\nisiana lawmakers seem to take pleasure in\nraiding the State Treasury by creating un\nnecessary offices, raising salaries and vot\ning extravagant appropriations, while the\nalready heavily burdened taxpayer is made\nto "make good." Are these "liberal"\nlegislators as prodigal in disbursing their\npersonal funds as they are in misappro\npriating the public funds? An answer is\nnot necessary.\n,\nA Pioneer Preacher Passes. I\nFrom the Shreveport Journal of July 25th. | j\nAll that was mortal of Robert James Harp j\nhas been consigned to the grave.\nIn the passing of this grand old man of\nGod, the city of Shreveport and the State\nof Louisiana lose one of their pioneers—a\nman with a record that has perhaps never\nbeen equalled in this country.\nBeginning his service in the Master\'s\nvineyard when but a lad of fourteen years,\nRobert James Harp spent seventy-one\nyears in the ministry of the Methodist\nChurch, being a charter member of the\nLouisiana Conference and serving as the\nfirst regularly assigned pastor of the con\ngregation now known as the First Metho\ndist Church of this city.\nHe did not belong to this city alone, for\nunder the laws of his church which limit\npastorates to four years in one charge, he\nwas sent to all parts of the State of Louisi\nana and was known and beloved in almost\nevery section of the commonwealth. For\nthe.church he loved and served so faith\nfully he suffered many privations and hard\nships in the early years of his ministry—\nthe days when handsome church buildings\nand lucrative salaries were practically un\nknown. He obeyed every call, giving\nabundantly of himself—all that he had to\ngive—the most precious of all gifts we must\nbelieve.\nThe end of-his life was peaceful. He\nwas ready and anxious, we do not doubt,\nto begin the journey to that blessed land to\nwhich his life-partner preceededhim buta\nfew short months—to that heavenly home\nprepared by the Father for those who love\nand serve Him upon the earth. We are\ntold that the allotted span of life is three\nscore-and-ten—for a period even longer\nthan this Robert James Harp went up and\ndown the land doing good to his fellowmen,\npreaching the gospel, uniting the happy\nlovers, burying the dead, giving solace and\nencouragement where most needed; A\nrecord of seventy-one years as a minister\nfor Christ is a splendid possession ; bearing\nthis record up to the pearly gates we can\nnot doubt that Robert James Harp was met\nwith the words of welcome: "Well done,\ngood and faithful servant; enter thou into\nthe joys of thy Lord."\nFROM OVER OUR GREAT STATE.\nThe Farmers\' Union assembled in annual\nconvention Tuesday at Opelousas.\nGround was broken last Thursday for\nthe site of a brick city hall in Kaplan.\nThe Memphis Commercial Appeal of last\nMonday in its report of cotton crop condi\ntions puts the crop in Louisiana for 1914 at\n82 as compared with 79 last year.\nFormer State Senator Henri L.

All of this has promoted the\ngrowth of the cane crop excellently. The\ncrop is nearly all laid by, but on those\nplaces where work has not been finished\nthe rains have of course, caused a post\nponement. The crop is showing a very\nencouraging tendency to catch up and if\nthe rains will now cease for a while and\nallow the finishing touches to be put to the\ncrop the conditions will become more en\ncou raging than they have been hitherto\nthis season.\nConfederate Deaths.\nCapt.

The condition one year ago\nwas 79.6 and the 10-year average is 80, so\nthat the crop this year averages .4 of one\nper cent below the 10-year average.

W. Perrin.\nNatehito^es Times.)\nIn our announcement column appears\nthe notice of the candidacy of T. W. Perrin\nfor the Democratic nomination for Con\ngress from this, the Eighth District.\nMr. Perrin is the same gentleman who\nwas in the race last election with J. B. As\nwell and made such a fine race. Accord\ning to the belief of many he was actually\nelected, but counted out.\nOf course, being arrayed against the\nself-constituted political authorities, he is\nsubject to the bitterest, fiercest and most\ncowardly attacks in secret and underhand\nways; but the people realized last election\nthat a job was being put up on them and\nthe political offices were being parcéled\nout among the politicians to suit them\nselves, and resented it by giving Mr. Per\nrin a handsome vote.\nWe sincerely trust that every liberty\nloving and true Democrat in the district\nwill rally to the support of Perrin—not so\nmuch for Perrin himself as for the cause\nhe represents—independent Democracy\nfree from intrigue, trading and hypocracy\nBeing human, of course Mr. Perrin has\nfaults, and these will be magnified and\nenlarged on until his worst private enemy\nwould not recognize him—but we believe\nhe is a man that can look friend and foe\nin the face and be frank; we believe he is\nb man with political convictions and m\none built on the order of a jellyfish and\ncapable of taking shape with any company\nhe happens to keep.\nAbout Perrin\'s ability, there can be no\ndoubt, for he ran proud and boastful Aswell\noff the stump in the first platform appear\nance in the last campaign—at Campti—one\nof the many "homes" claimed by the Doc\nGood news of the campaign comes from\nall over the district. The people are\naroused and are determined that no set of\npoliticians, no matter how great, shall meet\nin any back room and "divy " the offices\nout.\nAswell\'s duplicity, weakness and habit\nof trimming sails to suit the breeze, are\nbeing found out all over the district, and\npeople are leaving him. From Rapides,\nVernon, Avoyelles and Winn the deflec\ntions are very noticable. There is little\ndoubt but that Perrin will carry his own\nparish, LaSalle, by a larger majority than\nbefore. Dr. Aswell lost Natchitoches\nParish last time and will lose it by a larger\nmajority this time. Advices from Sabine\nand Grant are meagre.\nHere\'s to T. W. Perrin—our next Con\ngressman, by the grace of the People.\nFROM OUR STATE EXCHANGES.\na\nMonroe News-Star: No matter how\nvaried the views relative to the result of\nthe labors of the members of the general\nassembly, there seems to be a concensus\nof opinion the gentleman who made the\nmotion to finally adjourn is entitled to the\napplause and hearty commendation of the\npeople of the State.\nShreveport Journal : The Journal is es\npecially gratified over the fact that Con\ngressman John T. Watkins of the Fourth\nCongressional District is to be returned to\nthe House of Representatives without op\nposition.

You know the press\npeople have the reputation of taking care\nof everybody and everything except the\nnewspaper business.\nColfax Chronicle: Those long-haired\nmale "Hygenics" and wild eyed spinster\nwomen who have been advocating the\nteaching of sex hygiene in the schools,\n■have very properly been condemned by\nevery sensible father and mother in the\nland. And now comes the National Amer\nican Educational Association, which met\nin St. Paul, Minnesota, July 8th, and says\nthe teaching of sex hygiene by American\nteachers will never be allowed if that\npowerful association can prevent it.\nClaiborne Guardian-Journal: The leg\nislature just adjourned has fewer bills to\nits credit than the preceeding session for\nseveral years back and on this account\nthey are entitled to some eredit. However\na great mass of legislative matter dealing\nwith every conceivable subject was pre\nsented first and last for consideration all\nof which took time, and many bills of no\nearthly importance finally passed both\nhouses, and will remain on the statute\nbooks for no good purpose, till now and\nthen we get rid of some of them declared\nunconstitutional when attached by some\none with a grievance under it.\nClaiborne Guardian-Journal: The peo\nple of this State are surfeiting on politics,\nand it will be unfortunate indeed if an extra\nsession of the Legislature "becomes neces\nsary. The Gubernatorial campaign is al\nready pressing hard and it is indeed un\nfortunate if the people are to be distracted\nand diverted from the ordinary business\naffairs of life and to be forced as it were\ninto participating in partisan politics with\nout interruption from now till the inaug\nuration of the next Governor. * *\nIs there no hope for a surcease of the\nbitter political reign under which we now\nlive in this State, at least for a few montl^s,\nlong enough to turn aside for a short while\nto take up some of the practical economic\nquestions that so vitally concern the whole\npeople? From our view point the outlook\nfor such is not favorable.\nColfax Chronicle: The late Louisiana\nLegislature is said to have exceeded all\nformer aesemblies in its mania for the in\ntrodudiion of fool bills. The record is re\nported to be 966 bills introduced, and 317\nfinally passed. It is quite probable that\ntwo-thirds of the bills that were finally\npassed should have been killed. This\nflood of bills came from the ambitious pol\niticians of the Legislature, who were\nanxious to do something to attract noto\nriety, and from the fledging attorneys of\nthe body, who were more deeply concerned\nin making a name for astuteness for them\nselves than in serving the welfare of the\npeople. It is an unfortunate and annoying\nthing to have our already plethoric super\nabundance of laws added to, and confusion\nthus made worse confounded. The truth\nof the business is we want fewer new laws\nand more enforcement of the old laws\nalready on hand. A special session of the\nLegislature should be held for six months,\nat which no new laws should be introduced\nand the entire time of the Legislature di\nrected toward rendering more effective the\nlaws that have already been enacted.\nEcclesiastes.\nAll his days also he eateth in darkness,\nand he hath much sorrow and wrath with\nhis sickness.—v, 17.\nSuffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh\nto sin: neither say thou before the angel,\nthat it was an error: wherefore should God\nbe angry at thy voice, and destroy the\nwork of thine hands?—v, 6.\nThat which is crooked cannot be made\nstraight: and that which is wanting cannot\nbe numbered.

Then said I in my heart, As it\nhappeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even\nto me; and why was I then more wise?\nThen 1 said in my heart, that this also is\nvanity. For there is no remembrance of\nthe wise than of the fool for ever; seeing\nthat which now is in the days to come shall\nall be forgotten. And how dieth the wise\nman? aö the fool. Therefore I hated life;\nbecause the work that is wrought under the\nsun is grevious unto me: for all is vanity\nand vexation of spirit. Yea, l hated all\nmy labor which I had taken under the sun :\nbecausa I should leave it unto the man\nthat shall be after me: And who knoweth\nwhether he shall be a wise man or a fool?\nyet shall he have rule over all my labor\nwherein I have labored, and wherein I have\nshewed myself wise under the sun.

Should I\nbe honored by an election, it will be my pleasure and duty to exercise\npractically any aid in placing before our Legislative Assembly such\n\'\'measures as may be required to fix a fair and equitable standard of\nvaluation on a basis that will best help to remove, and avoid in the\nfuture any flagrant inequalities that are now generally alleged, and\ncommonly believed to exist.\nI deem it the special province of the Board of Equalization to find\nout and recommend any necessary changes in or addition to the\nassessment laws that will best subserve this end; and remove as far\nas reasonably possible, all causes for complaint against any apparent\ninequalities in assessments. Impartial and conscientious study of the\nsubject, as well as gathering the most satisfactory methods adopted\nin other states, should guide the board towards accomplishing very\nbeneficial results.\nA fixed standard of classification according to the legends of soil\nsurveys are easy enough, and made flexible for assessment on their\nactual character. Physical improvements are tangible, but subject to\nchanges. Intangible and hidden values may be developed by exact\ning forms of oaths, with penalties that will bring to light and add\nsuch a value to the tax rolls that the general rate of taxation can be\nabolished on some items, such as household furniture and farming\nmachinery, implements and work stock; and reduce taxation on all\nothers sufficient to remove all immoral incentives for concealment.\nIt may be admitted that there is almost a universal tendency to hide\nsome of our present taxable possessions from the ascessor, which it\nwould be a great blessing to remove or make unnecessary. It will\ncommand my best endeavors to aid in doing this, if the voters honor\nand entrust me with the official power, as I have no other use for\nthe job.
