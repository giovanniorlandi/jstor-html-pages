We shall see what we\nahall see.\nF. D. W. Arnold of Lamar, Mo.,\nwaa here Sunday attending a meet\ning of the directora of the Reunion\nAssociation.\nThe citv council ahould pass an\nordinance prohibiting the repair ol\nor buildine of any more wooaea\nawnings. A canvass awning costs\nno more in the long run than en\nold unsightly wooden affair. ,\nTom Campbell of Galena is going\nto put in a stock of drags in this\ncity. Mr. Campbell ia at present in\nbusiness in Galena. He will not\nquit business there, but will mere\nly branch out a little.\nChas. L. Smith, the privilege man\nof the big Baxter Reunion, took in\nthe reunion at Cherryvale thia week.\nIncidentally, he captured all the\nprivilege men there and will bring\nthem to the real big reunion.\nThe ahady lane leading out to\nAbrams\' place north of town ia be\ncoming favorite tryating place\nfor eome people who ought to know\nbetter. We will not mention names\nthia time, bat by the eternal, if\nthinga are not changed somewhat,\nwe aurely will tell all about it, and\nthe names won\'t look well in print,\neither.\nAa they aay nt the theatres, "the\nfree liat ia suspended." We mesn\nby that that hereafter no notice of\nany public meeting; entertainment,\nwhether revenue ia to be derived or\nnot, charity calls or anything of\nthat kind will be published in these\ncolumns without pay. In thia con\nsection we desire to aay that Mr.\nPeterson, publisher of the Repub\nlican, baa joined na In thia depart\nure. The reason is very plsin. The\nnewspspers of Bsxter Springs do\nmore to bene6t the town, churches,\nlodges, etc, then euy other institu\ntions in town, and get lees for It.\nThe city council haa seen fit to levy\nan occupation tax on newspaper\npublishers in thia city. Tne tsx\nwill be cheerfully paid, because sn.\nopportunity is presented the pub\nlishers to charge for what they do.\nAnd that ia what ahould be done,\nand will be done. We doubt if there\nia another town in the atate of Kan-\naaa the size of Bsxter Springs where\nan occupation tax ia levied on news\npaper publiahers. It is generally\nconceded that country newerapere\ndo a great deal more for a town\nthan they tret paid for, and for that\nreason they are not compelled to\npay a city license. But we are ratti\ner glad the tax hae been levied. We\ncan now with good grace for every\nthing we do. There ia no more rea\nson whv a newspaper ahould put\nout aeveral hundred signs for noth-\ninr than that a painter ahould de\nvote hie time and material for the\nsame number of eigne. Hereafter\nif you want a notice of any kind, no\nmatter what, publiahed, you will be\ncompelled to pay for it Audit yon\ndon\'t like thie new departure\nyou should not Diame sue . .newspa\nper men. Thev must make back the\nlicense they are compelled to pay.\nJust tell your trouble to the council.\nAH kinds of stove repaira at\nGregory\'s.\nThere waa a big crowd out to Re\nunion Park Sunday afternoon after\nthe rain. We believe everybody\nthere took from one to a dozen ridea\non the chutes. The chutes will run\nnext Sunday. The band will be out\nto the park all day. Better take\nyour lunch basket and go out and\nspend the day.\nRan ire atovea, $3X0 down, $1.00 per\nweek at Gregory\'e.\nIf the new occupation tax ordin\nance ia enforced, and it abould be,\nit ebould raise enough money to\ncat all the weede in town, and make\naome necessary street repaira. But\nwe will bet it will not be entorcea\nNo ordinance on the booka la en\nforced, so why ehould the occupa\ntion tax ordinance be enforced?\n1-79 pound pan cake baker, cheap,\nat Gregory\'s\nWe understand that if the barbera\nare compelled to pay an occupation\ntax for the privilege of working at\ntheir trade, that they will form a\ntrust, or community of interests,\nand raiae the price of ahaving to 15\ncents per. The barbera claim that\ntheir chairs are a part of their tools,\nthe same aa a carpenter\'a work\nbench or a blacksmith forge Is a\npart of their tools.
