The troops, composed I\nchiefly of Michigan and Wisconsin \'\nnational guardsmen, were traveling on\n| the Tuscania. a British vessel, under 1\n| convoy of British warships.

Only the j\nbriefest dispatches were received and\nnone gave any d>-tuils of the attack\non the liner. The president was at-1\ntending the theater when the news\narrived and was not informed of the\ncalastrophe until lie r> turned to the\nwhite hou.-e.

Just how many\ncould not be stated tonight.\nThe Tuscatiia was a British freight\nand passenger steamship of 14.348\ntons gross register. She was built at\n(Jlasgow in l\'Jlt and was owned by\nthe Anchor line. The last report of\nthe Tuscania was her arrival at an At\nlantic port January 17 lust. She was.\n567 feet long with a G6 foot beam and\nwas equipped to carry 2.500 passen\ngers. The ship hud twin screws and\na spel d of about 18 knots. She has\nbeen made the object of submarine\nattacks several limes during the war\nbut was able to escupe by her speed\nand some defense guns. She Is the\nfifth of the Cunard line boats to be\nlost since the war began. The Tus\ncania was sumptuously appointed\nw hen Hi lit put into service The pan\neling of her main lounge room was in\nolive wood inlaid with a line of syca\nmore. The lloors were of polished\noak. A veranda cafo and gymnasium,\nsmoke rooms, dining salons and a\nnovel system of heating and ventila\ntion were features of the ship It Is\nprobable, however, that in view of\nthe exigencies of the situation that\nthe steamer had been stripped of\nmost of her luxurious fittings in order\nto take as great a number of troops\na.? possible on each voyage.\nlluneranna. at which survivor* from\nthe Tuscanla were landed, is located\non Lough Swilly on the northern coast\nof Ireland, 12 miles from Ixmdonderry\nl/ough Swilly is a long narrow bay\nrunning in from the Atlantic Ocean\nLaron. where other survivors were\nlanded from the vessel.

It is a north channel\nI?orL fhe approximate distance be\ntween the two ports Is 100 miles .\nLO.NlX)N. fVb. 7.?Later (reports\nfrom the scene of the disaster say that\nthe condition of the survivors of the\nTuscanla was most pitiable and that\nin some cases men bad been swim\nming about for almost tw-o hours be\nfore rescued, and that many bail cast\naside all their clothing. The vessel\nitself remained afloat about two hours\nafter the torpedo struck.\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 7.?The Twen\ntieth Kngineers, known as the For\nesters, is the largest regiment in the\nworld, although only one buttullon\nwas on board the Tuscanla. The work\nof the regiment Is indicated to be the\ncutting of timber in the French forest\nfor military uses at the front. It Is\nthought that the luilure of the war\ndepartment to include the Ilritlsh sur\nvivors of the crew of the vessel nc\nroiin\'s for the differences In numbers\ntcptMed. Some speculation on the\npnrt of novnl odlcers is taking place\nas to whether or not the vessel struck\na mine. The region Indicated as the\nscene of the disaster Is one not fre\nquented by submarines but oflicllnl\ntexts of government announcements\nsay that the ship was torpedoed and\nthere is nothing to Imlicnte any error\nIn these formal announcements until\ndetailed accounts are received.\nLONDON, Feb. 7.? A statement\nfrom the admiralty today confirmed\nearlier figures giving total number ol\npersons on the Tuscanla as 2,397 and\ni the saved as 2.1X7. The approximate\n? figures of those saved are as follows:\nI Ofllrers, 76; men, 1,935; ollieers ol\nI the crew, 16; men of the crew, 125\nPassengers, 3; not specified, 32.\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 7.?The Tus\n- canla now lies at the bottom of tin\n> north Atlantic and at least 168 troop\n+++>+-l\ners. perhaps more, are missing- On \\\nthe basis of the figures reported to\nthe war department, the missing here\nwould be calculated aa 267. The fig\nures of the British Admiralty today, j\nhowever, placed the A .net lean troop- t\ntrs at 168. It is the lopartment\'H nan- j\ngu\'ne hope that the B/dvh figures j\nare correct. The BritUh convoys near {\n.he ship closed In qu\'.ckly and did\nheroic work, as tVt comparltively (\nsmall loss will show. The position\nof the ship was such that numbers of j\nBiitish patrol boats and other vessels\ntushed to he\' side, thus minimizing\nth ? losses. .t Is thought that the\nship stumbled upon a submarine\nlather than that the shot was the (\nmuch advertised first attack of the\nGerman offensive against American ^\nline Hoops and supplies. There was\nat Lr.s* some confusion as to whether \'\nthe 20th Engineers or the 107th Engi\nneer Corps was aboard but It was ,\nfinally rstabllshed that the 107th En\ngineers were not aboard. The head\nquarters Company and Companies S,\nN, E. and P of the 20th Engineers \'\nwere aboard the vessel, as was finally\nestablished by the reports. Every\nthing possible was done for the com- i\nfort of the Americans after their re- j\nscue and the war department Is deep j\nly thankful for the ready and sturdy i\nassistance rendered by the British\nvessels that came to the rescue.\nLONDONDERRY. Feb. 7.?The I *\ncommanding officer was the last to!\nleave the Tui-cania. He gave the As\nsociated Press Correspondent a vivid \'\n\'account of the disaster. His state\nment was that a second torpedo was ]1\nfired but missed its mark and that j \'\nthe first torpedo did the damage. Im\nmediately following the firing of the\nsecond torpedo a destroyer near the\nsubmarine dashed at the IT boat, using\na deep sea bomb dropping device and 11\nlit is claimed that the submarine was I\ndestroyed by bombs thus exploded. 11\nLONDON.

HENDERSON I\nINTRODUCES BILL\nSpecific Measure to Rectify\nExemption Provisions From\nTransportation Rule; Sena\ntor\'s First. Bill\nWASHINGTON. Feb. 7. Senator\nCharles B. Henderson, of Nevada, in\ntroduced a bill intended to make ab\nsolute, the long and short haul clause\nof the fourth sectiion of the act to\nregulate commerce.\nAs the law now stands, it pro\nvides that there shall be no higher\ncharge for a shorter, than for a long\ner haul on the same line, in the sane* J\ndirection, the shorter being included\nwithin the longer haul.\nAuthority conferred upon the Inter\nstate Commerce commission by the\nlaw, however, of the grant of exemp- j\ntions in special cases, have resulted\nin inequalities and hardship.-, Senator\nHenderson contends.\nThose exemptiions, he says, have;\nbeen so sweeping and g? n< ral in char\nacter .that they have in eff-ct b< come\na rule with the main provision of the\nlaw, amounting to little more than an\nexception.\nSenator Hendi rson. who now seeks\nto correct what ho term- the evil ex\nemption provision in the law, belrevci\nthat no power should exist anywhere,\n10 make exemptions from a transporta\ntion rule which is just and fair upon\nIts face.\nThe iong and short haul question\nhas been a subject of controversy In \\\nmoat of the western states.\nBills similar to that offered today\nby Senator Henderson have been in\ntroduced by Senator Shafroth, of\nColorado, and Senator Polndexter, of\nWashington.\nThe Nevada Senator\'s measure,\n\'however, is more specific than the\nproceeding bills.\n1\nBAND LIST GOES AHEAD\nTwo more subscriptions wore added\nto the band list yesterday by Micky\nFitzuiaurice of the Pioneer and Hobe\nClinton.

Let him\nplace his armies against ours in a\nfair fight and if we are whipped, which\nIs impossible, but for example, we\ncan take our medicine like men, but\nlet him murder our boys in cold blood\nas his accursed submarine did yes\nterday and our fury knows no bounds.\nWe cannot atop now.

Realizing at that i\ntime that the carrying of his plan to]\ncompletion would have to be the\nwork of later years, when he could\ncommand leisure and means, he en\ntered the world of Industry and work\ned his way up to the ownership of the\nfoundries and machine shops of For\'I\nItaly. After twenty-odd years Oi ef\nfort In this field he again \'ook up\nhis favorite experiment in aerial na\nvigation. Since then he h is devoted\nmuch of his time nnd has spent sev\neral hundred thousand dollars on the\nconstruction of dirigibles. The first\nof these, designed In 1901, he chris\ntened with the name of Leonardo da\nVlncl, the great Italian who in the \'\nfifteenth century foresaw thn possi\nbilities of aerial navigation. Dut not\ntill 1909 wns the "Leonardo" finished;\nnor was It all that its creator wanted r\nIt to be. He built a second nnd lm- |\nproved type, which he launched In jl\n1912 under (he name of "Citta dl Mil F\nano" In honor of his native city. Then !\nthe Italian navy wanted one, and this I\nreaulted In the "Forlaninl," third type, fi\nfor abort, F-3. The F-4 appeared in j|\n1?1?, the F 6 In J917. and what Is |\nforthcoming In 19T* may not ho told u\nThe great difference between the Oer\nman and the Italian type Is that the\nZeppelin in a rigid airship, while the\nForlaninl In flexible, or rather seml\nflexlblo. The Forlaninl, according to a\nreports. Is capable of flying sixty ft\nmiles an hour, of carrying n full de\nfensive equipment, with the appoint- |9\ned quantity of bombs, (measured In M\ntona,) and traveling at an altitude of ffl\n10,000 feet. The Italian dirigible lr I\nHltbt In construction In proportion to I\nIts site .another advantage over the\nZeppe\'un. as the light weight results\n| in efficiency of climbing. The For\nlanini is compact in construction,\nsince the nacelle is not suspended\nbut firmly attached to the body of\nihe ship; it offers the least resistance\nto the air because of the arrangement\nof its propelling and governing sys\ntem. The F-5 type, in volume, is TOO,-1\n000 cubic feet; the length, 300 feci;\nmaximum width, 66 feet. There are\ntwelve airtight compartments for the !\ngas. Total weight, 22.000 pounds. Tiie\nF-5 carries 22,000 pounds at the start.\nAt an altitude of 13.000 feet, where\nthe air is two-thirds rarefied, and the\nclimbing power of the airship conso i\nluently reduced, the dirigible can lift\n5,000 pounds, while it can lift 13 000\npounds at an elevation of 7,000 teei.\nThese figures are interesting wh< n ,\n:onsidered in connection with th< |\nveight of the crew, cons\'sting of one\ntommander, two officers, and two me-!\nchanicians, and to that of the fuel 1\nThe surplus earning power is avail\nible in time of war fo>- fighting equip\nment; in time of peace, for passen\ngers. The fightin gvaiuc of the air\nplanc lias since the war caused it hi\nivershadow the dirigible, but when1\n>eace comes the latter will probably)\n:orue Into greater vogue.?New York\nTimes Pictorial.\n:IVE CHICAGO UNIVERSITY\nCAPTAINS ARE IN SERVICE\nCHICAGO, 111., Feb. 7.?Five cap\ntains of Chicago University teams\ntave departed from school and now\nire at Camp McPherson, Atlanta, Ga., |\nis members of Base Hospital Unit j\nS"o. 13.

The day that those hundred\nmillions act as one, that day is Germany\'s doom!"\nToday Germany is fighting with a new and more\ndesperate energy because she fears that the American sol\nIB diers will arriver in time.\nBut Germany still refuses to believe that our hundred\nmillion people will "act as one."\nHow can we prove it to her? How can we strike to\nthe heart of the Hun? How can we convince the kaiser\nthat the day of his doom approaches?\n\'\'\nThat way is to lend our money to our country.\njig\nBy a War Saving Stamp; costing you until February\n1, 1918, .$1.12, worth $5 on January 1, 192".\nIf you cannot pay for it in immediate cash buy a IT.\nS.

Save every cent you can and\nput it into these stamps.\nThe money will be used immediately to provide guns,\nammunition, food, clothing and other supplies for our sol\ndiers and sailors.\nThis will be bad news for the kaiser?the worst he has\never heard?for it will prove to him that we arc ready to\n"act as one." It will prove that not only our men, but\nevery dollar we have is behind our country. It will prove\nH that we are in the war to win, and that we shall stay in\nit until we do win.
