The business men of\nAmerica have been expecting such a\ncoupe and Dodge Brothers have given\nit to them. We already have good\n- indications of a tremendous demand.\n"The change of design in the other\nDodge Brothers care indicates that\nwhile they have always adhered close\nly to the practical they are also pro\ngressive and abreast of the time.

Lrrissstont\nCHAPTER X\n"\n- The Abysmal Depths.\n: Molly did not see Bowyer for two\nmonths after Kitty\'s departure. His\nnext visit was as unexpected as all of\nhi. It was in the afternoon, and the\ngirl came back from a walk along the\nshore to see him seated in the store,\nsleek, red, and self-satisfied, and her\nfather standing beside him, with that\nlook of awful fear on his face. She\nhad a momentary Impression as if the\nfactor stood up like a well man; but,\nas she- entered, the right leg went\ndragging under him, and the arm fell\nlimp at his side. \'\n"How d\'ye do. Miss McDonald !\ncalled Bowyer." "I just dropped in to\nhave a chat with the factor in passing.\nBig things happening here, eh? The\nMissatibi\'s mighty slow in crossing\nBig Muskeg."\nMolly flamed at the Insult to Wilton.\nShe looked at her father, and the ex\npression on his face went to her heart.\nShe turned swiftly to Bowyer.\n"I \'don\'t want you to come here\nagain;" she said.\nHe started up, spluttering. "We don\'t\nwant\' you " she continued. "And we\nwon\'t be persecuted by you. There\'s\nlaw in this country." \' .\nHe burst, into mocking laughter.\n"You never spoke a truer word, Miss\nMcDonald!" he cried. "I came here\nas a friend."\n"You can go as an enemy I" she re\ntorted. "And you can go now. And\nremember there are men about here\nwho can use a whip!" (\nHe glared at her, but went without\na word, and Molly ran to the factor.\n"He\'s torturing you!" she sobbed. "I\ndon\'t know what his power over you\nis, but he mustn\'t come here again!\nA few days later Bowyer went in to\nClayton and, by chance, his visit coin\ncided with Wilton\'s. \' .\nWhen Wilton left her house, Kitty\nsank down Into a chalr, clasping and\nunclasping her fingers nervously." The\nfirst time when Wilton had repulsed\nher, she had been too humiliated and\nconscience-stricken to bear him resent\nment. Her visit to Molly had been a\nsudden evil impulse, which, when done,\nshe had attempted to justify.\nr She, had, \' of Course, succeeded.\nGradually .she had begun to look upon\nherself as a deeply wronged woman\nWhen a woman loves, love is its own\njustification for acts done in its name.\nOn the second occasion of her ad-\nvances to Wilton she saw. by Instinct\nthat she had almost conquered. She\nsaw, too, that, having lost,\' she had\nlost forever. She might win Wilton\nyet, but never in that way.\nNow s she would go to any lengths\nto, oust-Molly. Molly had never writ\nten to her since her departure, and she\ndid not even know if her scheme had\nsucceeded In estranging her from Wil\nton. But she inferred success from\nWilton\'s bearing. He had not looked\nlike a successful lover.\n\' Bitterly she reflected on her marriage-\nwith Joe. She had never loved\nJoe, but neither had she - hated him\nShe had loxeJ Wilton, r and, ; bound by\ntradition and social circumstances, she\nhad concealed it. Then Joe had died.\nEverything had seemed possible. And\nWilton had engaged himself . to an\nother to her best friend. Kitty was\nnot a bad woman, but she meant to\nfight for her own. She would win Wil\nton, cost what it might.\nWhen, therefore, late on the day afr\nter he had called on her, the maid an\nnounced Tom Bowyer, who had never\nbeen In \' her house before, she sent\ndown word that she would receive\nhim.\nNeither Wilton nor Bowyer was\naware that the other was In" Clayton\nwhen Bowyer called, nor did they\nmeet.\nKitty came , downstairs, to find\nBow\'yer standing in the parlor, twirl\ning his hat in his hands.

Her passion for Wilton was\ntaking her into unrelished companion\nships. She asked him to sit down. "I\'m\npleased to see you, Mr. Bowyer," she\nsaid. "It was very good of you to\ncall."\nBowyer uttered a short laugh. "I\'m\nnot a calling man, Mrs. Bostock," he\nsaid, "and the ladies don\'t like me.\nThey know too much about me."\n"That\'s very poor taste on their\npart," said Kitty.\n"That\'s as may be.\' \' I came here on\nbusiness."\nTm , glad to see you on business,\nthen," said Kitty.\nBowyer looked at her in admira\ntion. "I see we understand each\nother," he said. "That\'s what I like.\nTon ought to have been a man. Not\nbut what you\'d have been spoiled If\nyou had been," he added, with a clumsy\neffort at a compliment.\nKitty laughed outright. "Now I\nknow you have come to get something,"\nshe said.\n"Not exactly. We\'ve fixed things\nso that you\'ll be able to pull out about\nChristmas with your full investment.\nBut suppose Carruthers makes trouble?\nRemember, you\'ve done what you did\nfor his sake as well as your own. You\nwant to help him go into a more re\nmunerative investment. You know that\nlittle affair of his is off?"\nShe started violently, and Bowyer\ndid not need to await her answer.\n"That\'s what I came to tell you,"\nhe went on. "So I know we can\ncount on you to smooth things over if\nCarruthers begins to wonder. You\'re\nstanch, then?"\n"You can count on me, Mr. Bowyer,"\nanswered Kitty, loathing herself and\nhim. "But how about yourself?\', I un\nderstand from you that you were going\nslow. I hope you\'re not going too\nslow?"\n"I\'m going to speed things up soon,"\nhe answered, frowning. "What\'s\nhappened helps things along. I don\'t\nknow what the trouble was. I thought\nat first It was one of those lover\'s\nquarrels. But It\'s lasted." His face\ngrew red. "I went there," he said\nthickly. "She wouldn\'t have anything\nto say to me. Ordered me off the\nplace."\nBowyer leaned forward confidential\nly. "See here, Mrs. Bostock," he said.\n"If I get her out of the way if I\nguarantee that Will Carruthers and\nshe won\'t meet again, howll that suit\nyou?"\n"You\'ve changed your mind about\nmarrying?"\n"Maybe yes. Maybe no. I\'m not a\nmarrying man. Nobody Is. It\'s general\nly an accident or a trap. But I can\npromise you there\'ll be no trouble from\nthat quarter. Also, that she\'ll be out\nof the\' district before winter."\n"That wont do," said Kitty with\nsudden fierceness. "She may come\nback." i\n"She wont. And If she did, and\nwent down on her knees to him, he\nwouldn\'t look at her."\n"What do you mean?" asked Kitty\nbreathlessly.\' .\n. Bowyer leaned forward again and\nwhispered in her ear. Kitty was as\npale as death. "How\'ll that do for\nyou?" he asked triumphantly.\nKitty rose, trembling. \'Til stick to\nmy word," she \'said. "But you\'re the\nlowest cur I\'ve ever known, Tom\nBowyer, and I hope I hope some\nbody flays you fla 3-3 the skin off you\nbefore you\'ve run your course."\nni take my chance of that,"\ngrinned Bowyer, as he rose.\nKitty sank back in her chair, her\nhands over her face. Of a sudden the\nabysmal depths of sin had opened be\nneath her. She was tempted to run\nafter him and call him back. But she\ncould not stir. It was some time be\nhore she forced herself to rise. She\nwent to the window. She guessed that\nBowyer was going to the bank. He\nStudebaker Special Six Touring\nBeautifully equipped, forty days\nold, for sale. Car in Mr. Bridges\' ga\nrage.

Wilton was passing on\nthe other side of the road. He held\nhis head high, yet he walked like a\nman who was \'.broken.\nKitty watched him go by. Her heart\nwas full of pity for him, for his quix\notic dreams, his foolish faithfulness to\nJoe. The picture that Bowyer had\nlimned of Molly faded from her mind\nunder the brighter glow that came\nInto it.\nLike Wilton, Bowyer had business\nto transact with Phayre. He went\nto the bank ; it was after hours, but\nhe knew Phayre would be there, await\ning him.\n"Carruthers Is in town," said the\nbank president.\n"He Is, eh?" asked Bowyer, darting\na keen glance at him.\'- "When did he\nget in?" "\n"Day before yesterday. He was\nsubpoenaed on that case."\n"That\'s so, of course," said Bowyer.\n"What did they getr ...\n. "Six months apiece."\n"No new light on the murder of our\nfriend?"\n"Nothing. Qualn didn\'t go Into that\nphase of the affair at alL He\'d ques\ntioned them, and couldn\'t prove any\nthing." -\nBowyer fell into a -brown study for\na few moments.\n"Carruthers been here yet?" he In\nquired presently.\n"Not yet. He\'s trying to raise a cool\nhalf-million in town. I guess he\'s been\nto the last likely place by now. \' So\nhell be here tomorrow to renew the\nloan."\nYou\'ll renew, of course," said\nBowyer. "Excellent wheat lands I\nFine investment \' for your bank, the\nMlssatfbi ! By the way, you hit It\nstrong with that cartoon 1" 4\n. They both laughed, first at the car\ntoon, then at Bowyer\'s raillery.\n"No more trouble with Clark?" asked\nBowyer.\n"Not at present. I guess that extra\ntwo hundred squared him. - He\'s a\ndangerous customer to handle, though.\nAnd absolutely indispensable for a job\nlike we had to handle. A first-class\nman at his trade, cool as a cucumber,\nand looking like a gentleman. You\'ll\nfind it hard to beat that combination.\nHe could have had more than the two\nhundred he held me up for."\n"He\'s certainly worth it," admitted\nBowyer. "WhatH you do with him\nnext year?"\n\' "Why, he seems to like the work\nhere," answered Phayre, laughing. TH\nkeep him on, under my eye at a re\nduced salary."\nThey both chuckled over that, but\nBowyer grew serious quickly. "Well,\nFve fixed Kitty Bostock," he said.\n"Lord, It\'s a cinch handling fhat type\nof woman. Once they fancy some\nparticular man, they\'ll go through h 11\nto get him."\n"You\'ve told her youH buy her shares\nat par," he said. "You haven\'t com\nmitted yourself irrevocably to that?"\nBowyer threw his head Tback and\nemitted one of his short laughs. "Well,\nI may change my. mind," he said. "It\nisn\'t In writing." \' V\n"Suppose she raises Cain?"\n"She can\'t She\'s in too deep. She\ndoesn\'t know how deep."\nPhayre laughed again, but nervously.\n"I never cared much for this business,\nBowyer," he said. "If Joe Bostock\nhadn\'t died as he did rd never have\ngot mixed up with It. But that gave\nus our chance. It was a very lucky\naccident. If we werent committed be\nyond recovery, I\'d pull out even now."\n"Pull outr echoed the other. "How\nthe devil can we pull out? The trick\'s\niflone."\n"You\'ve"\n"Tve fixed It about that safe. We\nbad a devil of a job the first time we\ntried. He\'s got a deafmute there who\nseems to have eyes like a cat, and\nsleeps with them open. Carruthers\ncaught Lee Chambers at the window\nand smashed his nose.\' And, of course,\nChambers\' usefulness at the camp -is\nended. However, I\'ve fixed it now,\nand a day or two will see us with what\nwe want, and Carruthers with what he\ndoesn\'t want."\n"I suppose there\'s no doubt those\nhalf-breeds did kill Joe Bostock," sug\ngested Phayre, darting a keen look at\nthe other.\nT guess not," answered Bowyer.\n"Anyway, if s no business of ours how\nit happened. Qualn put everybody\nthrough the mill, including me. That\nshows he\'s at his wits\' end. If a new\nclue comes to hand hell jump at it,\nfor the sake of his reputation. By the\nway, Quain\'s the man I came In to see\nyou about. You\'ve had a talk with\nhim?"\n"I saw him yesterday."\n"How did he take it?"\n"Fine!" said Phayre, rubbing his\nhands. "Hook, bait, end sinker. I\ncould see the flash of illumination\ncome into his eye as the seed began\nto sprout."\n"You didnt suggest ?" t\n"No; Fm not quite such a fool as\nthat, Bowyer. I spoke to him about\nJoe Bostock\'s investments, and the\nmissing half-million that he had drawn\nout a day or two before his. murder.\nAnd I left Quain to draw his own in\nferences. Don\'t worry ! Hell draw\nthem!"\n"Capital!" said Bowyer. "You\'re a\ngood partner, Phayre, and In a few\ndays our patience will he rewarded."\n(Continued Tomorrow)\nCareful attention to the wants of\npeople who know good meats when\nthey see them is what has built up the\nMain Street Market.
