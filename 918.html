Certainly. It would not be\n"yourchild" if it did not. Everybody\'s\nchild says "bright things," from his or her\nview point.\nBryan\'s paper, The Commoner, has\nbeen listed by the tax assessor at $22,250.\nAnybody who has ever read The Commoner\nwill admit that this appraisement is a trifle\nhigh. —Exchange.\nBryan is now considered by a united\nDemocracy both "safe and sane" for the\npresidency in 1908. Rubbing up ugainst\nthe Asiatic heathen worked wonders men\ntally and morally on the windy Moses from\nNebraska.\nIt was the direct primary law that put\nthe political tricksters to sleep over in Illi\nnois last week and it will do the same thing\nfor the political freebooters of Washington\nif the people will have it enacted.\nThe drought in Western Washington,\nwhich has covered a period of almost two\nmonths, says Weather Observer Salisbur\nbury, has about reached its limit. The\npeople are in pretty nearly the same fix.\nMayor William Hickman Moore is in a\nhospital at Los Angeles, California, suffer\ning from an ear trouble, so the dispatches\nsay, but we expect he is suffering to a\ngreater degree from being away.

This\nmob captain is now in jail, but it has re\nquired the standing army of the state to\nprevent his fellow-criminals on the outside\nfrom storming the jail and releasing him,\nthus proving that North Carolina is all but\nin the clutches of the worst type of red\nhanded anarchists known to civilization.\nW. A. Peters, who for many years ope\nrated a merganthaler job office in Seattle,\nhas moved to Prosser where he has begun\nthe publishing of the Benton County Re\npublican, the first number of which has al\nready been circulated. The paper looks\nprosperous and Editor Peters, who was in\nSeattle one day this week, says Prosser\n"looks good" to him, the two other weekly\npublications in the city to the contrary not\nwithstanding. "I am running a farmers\'\npaper and I feel that it will be a huge suc\ncess," is the way Mr. Peters expressed it.\nHe has the only Merganthaler typesetting\nmachine in the county, which will enable\nhim to put out a whopping good paper at a\nnominal cost.\nThe governors of the state of Mississip\npi since 1784 have all been Democratic in\npolitics, but generally men of horse sense.\nThe present governor, J. K. Vardeman,\nis not only a damphool in politics, but he is\nas crazy as a march hare on general prin\nciples.\nNome\'s Strong newspaper man is now\na resident of Seattle, he having sold his\nNome Nugget. There is no denying the\nfact that the Major is a Strong edito\nrial writer and will make a Strong pull\nfor a place on some Seattle paper.\nCouncilman Gill may have a splendid\nsupply of sattire, but Councilman Crichton\nis also there with the goods when once ar\nroused, and Gill knows that now !\nPRICE TEN CENTS.\nTHAT MUNICIPAL STREET RAILWAY\nIn the past The Seattle Republican has\nbeen a strong advocate of municipal own\nership of public utilities and it still believes\nin that doctrine, and that, too, to the ex\nclusion of all competitors, but it will not\nadvocate this municipality owning and op\nerating a public utility for the purpose of\n"revenue only;" nor will it advocate this\nmunicipality owning and operating a com\npeting street railway system to that of a\nprivate concern, by building the same at\nthe public\'s expense and still charge pas\nsengers the same fare as the private con\ncern.\nWhen The Seattle Republican took up\nthe advocacy of the city of Seattle owning\nand operating a competing railway system\nit did it on the theory that the constitution\nof this state permitted a municiaality to\ncondemn any street car system within its\ncorporate limits, by having the same ap\npraised, and after having paid the sum\nnamed by the appraisers to take it over and\noperate it under the regulations of the city.\nA number of articles from time to time\nhave appeared in The Seattle Republican,\nshowing the feasibility and right of the\ncity of Seattle to condemn the present rail\nway system and operate the same.\nThe proposition, however, that is to be\nvoted on the 12th of next September is for\nthe city to appropriate out of the general\nfunds a million and a half dollars, not to\ntake over the properties of the Seattle Elec\ntric Company and operate the same, mind\nyou, but to build a competing system, and\na money maker, if you please; but despite\nthat fact, the People, after having paid for\nthe building of this Proposed street railway\nsystem are to receive no reduction in fares\nor anything else, but are to get shorter\nrides and Pay the same fare as they are\nnow doing; which reminds us of a person\nbuying an automobile to save horse-feed,\nwhen, in fact, the cost of the wear and tear of the\nauto, is moro than the value of the horse.\nWhen a municipality adopts the theory of own\nership of public utilities, it does, or it should do it\nwith the idea of reducing the cost of the comodity\nor utility to the consumers to the least and lowest\ncent above an economical running expense. It\nshould not be done for mercinary gain, nor for the\npurpose of crushing some private concern, but for\nthe benefit and general relief of the people. If it\nis to be built for revenue, then it should be made\nto finance itself, and the people should not be called\nupon to put up one cent for the construction of the\nsame.\nJohn E. Humphries, who has had more to say on\nthis subject of the city of Seattle operating its own\nstreet railway system, has repeatedly declared that', 'Page 2\nthe whole plant and system could be financiered\nand built without it costing the city a single cent,\nand yet it would be able to reduce the passengers\'\nfare from the very first to at least three cents per\nride with transfers. But the city is not only be\ning called upon to give a large sum to start the pro\nposed system, but at some subsequent date will be\ncalled upon to give a still larger sum to complete it,\nwith still no reduction in the fares in sight; and\nthus the tax-payers are to be slashed going and\ncoming. This reminds us of the time we pawned\nour watch for $15, and after having paid $20 inter\nest on the watch finally lost it. We simply paid\nthe other fellow just $20 to take the watch, and\nthen he sold it for double what he had to originally\npay for it. Of course the proposed system is bound\nto be a money-maker from the start, for it has cost\nnothing to start it—nothing at least to those per\nsons who will operate it, and the funds it takes in\nmay be squandered or transferred to some other\ndepartment at will, and yet in no wise cripple the\nsystem, for the people put up its construction\nprice and it will begin without debt or interest.\nMAY HAVE OULIVED ITS USEFULNESS\n(From The New York Sun.)\nThere are unmistakable signs that the process\nof party disintregation and realignment, of which\nwe have had memorable examples in the United\nStates, is once more far advanced and irresistible.\nOnce more, as in 1822 and 1854, a party\'s culminat\ning triumph has been followed by symptoms of\nswift decay and dissolution. Events will soon de\ntermine whether the Rnpublican party is destined,\nlike the Jeffersonian party in 1824, or the Demo\ncratic party in 1860, to be split into fragments; or,\nlike the Federalist party and the Whig party, to be\ncome utterly extinct. Experience has shown that\nparty government is necessary to the working of\nrepresentative institutions; but, of course, it does\nnot follow that a given party may not outlive its use\nfulness. When that time comes, and the fig tree is\nseen to be irreparably barren, the inexorable fiat is\nuttered from the ballot box: "Cut it down ! Why\ncumbereth it the ground? "\nThe history of the United States under the Con\nstitution is strewn with the wrecks of political or\nganizations once full of vitality and promise. It\nwould have seemed incredible to Alexander Hamil\ntom on his deathbed had he been told that the Fed\neralist party, which had launched the national gov\nernment, which had lost the last presidential con\ntest by only eight electoral votes and would, but for\nHamilton himself, have defeated Jefferson in the\nHouse of Representatives, would in that year (1804)\nbe able to muster only about a twelfth of the elect\noral votes for its candidate, and sixteen years later\nwould be impotent to carry a single state. How\ncould Jefferson, seeing the party created by him\nself, exalted to the pinnacle of victory when in\n1820 the last member of the Virginia dynasty got\nevery electoral vote but one, conceive or believe\nthat within four years that party would be rent\ninto factions pursuing irreconcilable aims and ran\ncorously hostile to each other ? How could it have\nbeen possible for Henry Clay, who was to be so\nlong the inspiration and the strength of the Whig\nparty, when he beheld it sweep the country in 1840\nby a majority of 174 electoral votes, to foresee that\nit would hold together but little more than a dec\nade, and that within a quarter of a century it would\nhave become a memory ? How was it possibles for\nDemocrats in 1852, when Hunkers and Barnburners\ncombined to bear Franklin Pierce to the White\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nHouse by the astounding majority of 212 electoral\nvotes, to imagine that within two years their party\nwould be so shattered by the Nebraska bill that its\nimplacable sections would in 1860 hold two national\nconventions and put forward two rival candidates ?\nYet what Hamilton, or Jefferson, or Henry Clay, or\nFranklin Pierco could not have foretold at the dates\nnamed would have been patent to every onlooker a\nfew years later.\nAs history never repeats itself precisely we can\nnot expect to find an exact analogue to the existing\nsituation in any of the conditions to which we have\nreferred. There is, however, a sharp difference to\nday between those Republicans who accept for\ntheir leaders Senator La Follette, of Wisconsin,\nand Gov. Cummins, of lowa, and those whose ac\ncredited spokesmen are Senator Spooner and Sena\ntor Aldrich as there was between "Conscience\nWhigs" and "Cotton Whigs," or between those\nDemocrats who advocated and those who opposed\nwith vehemence the repeal of the Missouri Compro\nmise. On the other hand, the Republicans are still\nheld together by the force of a magnetic individual\nity, as the Whigs were up to 1852. It is unques\ntionably true that Theodore Roosevelt has come to\npersonify, as Henry Clay personified, the energies\nand the hopes of his political organization. Such a\nprocess of incarnation has its dangers. When Henry\nClay died the country recognized that the Whig\nparty had been eviscerated. Its vitals were gone.\nMen said to one another at Clay\'s funeral: "Time\nwas that when the brains were out the man would\ndie.\'\' The Repubiican party will be lucky if the\nprospects of Mr. Roosevelt\'s early retirement\nfrom public life do not excite similar forebodings.\nIt is certain that if we look at states which used\nto be accounted strongholds of one party or another\nwe encounter portents of party disintegration such\nas were witnessed in 1854. Missouri was wrenched\nfrom the Democratic column in 1904. On the other\nside, Ohio chose last year a Democratic governor,\nand even Pennsylvania elected a Democratic state\ntrersurer. In the last named state this year\nDemocratic and Republican reformers have united\nupon a ticket which promises to be successful.\nEven in New Jersey, the populous counties of Hud\nson and Essex are honeycombed with revolt against\nthe regular Republican organization. In the Em\npire commonwealth nobody knows who will get the\nRepublican nomination for the governorship, and\nno wise man wants it. The only kind of peace at\ntainable between the followers of Higgins, Odell\nand Platt is the kind preached by Joab to Abner\nwhen he drove his knife under the fifth rib. Be\nsides, so long as Theodore Roosevelt stands aloof\nfrom the contest, who knows how much substance\nthere is left to the Republican party? There are\nclose observers in the city and up-state who allege\nthat the Hearst propaganda has eaten deep into its\nbowels. If we try, on the other hand, to forecast\nthe course of the Democratic party in this state we\nfind ourselves equally at sea. The old parties are\nsmitten with a wasting malady. All can see the\ndisease; but where is the physician ?\nThere is no doub that from the welter of dis\ncord and mutiny a new political order will ultimate\nly be evolved. But shall we have long to wait for\nit, as we waited when parties broke up in 1854 1\nOr will it come quickly and decisively, as it might if\nDemacrats should put forward a leader possessed of\nRoosevelt\'s vitalizing personality ?\nAugust 10, 1906\nJ.

Barrow, a well-knwn Spokane Afro-\nAmerican, died in Tacoma last week from the effects\nos having been thrown from a street car while at\ntending a Baptist association in that cby. Mr. Bar\nrow had been a resident of Spokane for nearly twenty\nyears, and for a number of years was a conspicuous\nfigure in the Populist political party both of the state\nand of the county. He was a candidate for Presi\ndenial elector in 1896 and subsequently was the re\ncipient of small political favors at the hands of his\nparty. Peter Barrow hailed from Vicksburg, Miss.,\nwhere before the war he was a slave. In reconstruc\ntion days he entered the political arena and was elect\ned to the legislature from Warren county, in which\ncounty Vicksburg is situated, and according to news\npaper clippings relative to the doings of that legisla\nture, found in a scrap book, the property of another\nprominent Negro politician of thnt state, he made a\nsplendid record. It was Mr. Barrow\'s boaet in life\nthat he was the first representative in the\nUnited States to cast a vote for a Negro Uniled States\nsenator. The names of the members being arranged\nalphabetically and no n&me beginning with the firs;\nletter Barrow was the first to be called, and he voted\nfor the Hon. Hiram R. Revels, who was elected on\nfirst ballot and served the four years of Jefferson\nDavis\' unexpired term. A copy of said record is in\nthe possession of the editor hereof, and bear out the\nstatement made by Mr. Barrow. Only two admitted\nNegroes ever served in the United States senate, viz:\nHon. Hiram R. Revels and Hon. B. K. Bruce, both,\nfrom Mississippi; the former serving fonr years\nwhile the latter served six years.\n• • •\nBUSINESS MEN\'S LEAGUE\nThe three last days of this month the Negro Busi\nness Men\'s League will be in session at Atlanta, Ga.\nMultiplied hundreds of Negrees from all parts of this\ncountry will be present, and some time during the\ndeliberations of the league they will each tell of their\nbusiness experiences at their respective homes. The\nhead of this organization is that great industrial edu\ncator Prof. Booker T. Washington, of Tuskegee In\nstitute. It is a splendid annual coming together of\nthe Negro and canuot fail to produce good results\nfor the race all over the country. There ia a crying\ndemand, even among the Negroes themselves, for\nthe best of everything, though one of their blood be\nthe vendor.\nThe Negro who thinka his effects for barter and\nsale, though of an inferior grade, are good enough\nfor "cullud folk" is getting left, and deservedly so.\nNothing is more responsible for the poor success of\nthe Negro journalist than the fact that he or she edits\nthe paper with idle, silly talk and thinks it good\nenough for Negroes. No wonder the Negro sub\nscriber tells the Negro editor "there is nothing in\nyour paper," for the paper itself is a swift witness.\nGood, wholesome literature the Negro demands\nand wants, and if he cannot get it from a paper run\nby a man of his own blood then he buys of someone\nelse. It is hoped that someone from Seattle will be\npresent in Atlanta to represent her Negro enter\nprises and energy, and The Seattle Republican would\nsuggest that a purse be made up and someone sent,\nthere. The cost weuld be nominal, if a dozen or\nmore would chip in. The Seattle Republican is\nready to do its part toward raising funds for such a\ndelegate and has no choice.\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nI. B. KNICKERBOCKER,\nWho is to Succeed Dr. J. J. Smith From the Thirtieth Senatorial District\nTOO MUCH POLITICS\nProper political recognition for the Negro in the\nvarious state and county governments of the United\nStates, and even in the federal government, is a\nmuch coveted boon and it ia hoped by the Negro\neverywhere that it will sooner or later come. Tho\nNegro, however, would reap a greater harvest of suc\ncess if he himself would become the master of some\ntrade or become a specialist in «ome kind of art or\nhandicraft, so that his productions would be sought\nafter over all others for either their beauty or real\nvalue, or both. For the past fourteen years or more\nthere has been a bi-annual scamble among the Ne\ngroes of Seattle and King county for political recog\nnition, and despite their freequent threats to rebuke\nthe Republican parry there is at present but one Ne\ngro drawing a salary from the county —Frank Abra\nhams, bailiff in Justice of the Peace George\'s court —\nand his white friends sot him the job, and that, too,\nover the protest of some of the most representative\nNegroes in the county. Had the same amount of\nenergy been put on a potato or hop farm $100,000 at\nleast would have been realized from the investment.\nThe Negro in his life battle is overlooking the little\nthings all about him in his madness to become in\nfluential politicians and office-holders. This is an\nage of specialists and the person who can make\nsomething better than anyone else, or.do something\nbetter than anyone else, is the person who will suc\nceed and shine a thousand times brighter in the eyes\nof the world than the man whose only-stock in trade\nis professional politics, and this is especially true of\nthe Negro. This is said advisedly, for from Maine\nto Mexico and from the Atlantic to the Pacific there\nis an unwritten law among the whites: "keep the\nNetrro out of office," and the law is oheyed. Being\ntoo few in numbers to change the code, why kick\nagainst the pricks?\nIf you cannot be pudding why not be pie? There\narea hundred and one little things in which you\ncould engage, even in Seattle, that would be more\nremunerative than if you held a political job year in\nand year out, until you grew gray in the service.\n* * *\nNEGRO WOMEN IN FACTORIES\nThe employment by a large manufacturing firm\nin Baltimore of about 400 Negresses aa operatives\nhas given rise to a discussion in economics, especial\nly in relation to white and colored labor. The em\nployment of colored labor to such an extent in a line\nof work that had formerly been monopolized by\nwhite labor meant somewhat of and industrial inno\nvation, and it aroused consternation among white\nworkers in that particular field.\nThe charge was made that, ac the Nearro operat\nives were cheaper than whites, the change was\nmade to curtail expenses, but the employers denied\nthis, and declared that the sole cause was the scarci\nty of white labor. It is interesting in this connection\nto learn that, while it is practically impossible to get\nNegresses for domestic service, there is little trouble\nin getting all that are wanted for work in factories.\nA student of economics noting this fact naturally\ninfers that the Negro woman, attaining a higher\nstandad of education than ever before, is endeavor\ning to elevate herself by seeking employment in a\nfield of labor which she considers less menial than\nthat to which she has heretofore been accustomed.\nShe is imbibing the sentiments fonnd everywhere\namong white women who prefer work in factory or\nshop to domestic service.\nThe natural protest by whites against the invasion\nof Negro women as factory operatives is met by the\nreply that there is no real reason to fear that it will\nseriously affect the market for white labor. The\nNemress, it is said, will be employed only when white\nlabor cannot be had. her work not being entirely sat\nisfactory, and her main incentive for toil being to\nsupport lazy male members of the family. The lat\nter suggestion is evidently made by one who has\nstrong local prejudice against the male Negro.—\nBpokeman-Beview.\nPage 3', 'Page 4\nPOLITICAL POT-PIE.\nNow that Dr. J. J. Smith has withdrawn\nfrom the senatorial race in the Thirtieth district\nthe Pie-maker desires to suggest the name of\nDr. C. E. Hoye of Ravensdale for the place. If he\nis nominated all factions will be pleased, for aside\nfrom the fact that he is very popular he is free\nfrom factional fusses, and would poll more than his\nparty strength. He is particularly strong among\nthe mining camps, and having lived in Auburn for\nmany years he is likewise popular in that locality,\nand on the whole he would make an ideal candidate\nfor state senator. The name of W. H. Clark has\nalso been suggested, but it would be unwise to\nnominate him, for he would not be elected. Mr.\nClark unfortunately has made many political ene\nmies in the district, who would fight him from En\numclaw to Burton and defeat him.\nThe \'"push" in the Thirtieth senatorial district\nproposes to nominate I. B. Knickerbocker instead\nof Dr. J. J. Smith, who is to be held in reserve for\nthe gubernatorial nomination in 1908.\nIt is being hinted that W. A. Carle may be with\ndrawn frcm the commissioner fight and may be\ngiven the senatorial nomination from the Thirty\nfirst, thereby eliminating both Van De Vanter and\nNichols. Gen. George W. Tibbetts will perhaps be\nsent to the house of representatives.\nA free-for-all fight is still being waged in the\nThirty-second, with the odds seemingly tavoring no\nparticular one of the aspirants. Rawson and Wil\nliams are fighting for the Ninth ward; Watson Al\nlen and E. M. Mann are battling for the Tenth\nward, and Tom Page is hoping to get the Eleventh.\nAbe Kistler seems to have the inside track ovei\nin tht Thirty-third, though Senator Piles has not\nfully given up the hope of landing Plinny Allen.\nKistler would be generally acceptable.\nGeorge U. Piper will be nominated in the Thirty\nfourth hands down. He will have every precinct in\nthe Fourth ward and will give Weir battle in one\nprecinct of the First ward, Clancy to the contrary,\nnotwithstanding.\nBilly Potts apparently has the best of the con\ntest in the Thirty-fifth,although if Renick or Jeffries\ncould line up the Fourth precinct of the Fifth ward\nwith a "house" candidate Bily would have the\nlargest number of delegates, but not enough to\nnominate, and the combine would give him trouble.\nIf, on the other hand, Billy lines up with the fourth\nor fifth precincts of the Fifth ward, or the Seventh\nward precincts, then the other candidates would\nnot be in it for a minute.\nJoe Lyons, thus far, is without oppositon in the\nThirty-sixth. There are a number of aspirants for\nthe lower house, but none seem to care to tackle\nthe senate thus far, leaving Joe a walkover for the\nnomination.\nIn the Thirty-seventh is where the hard fighting\nwill be done. Both Senator Palmer and Represen\ntative-Attorney-General-Would-Be-Senator Booth\npropose to put up the scrap of their lives to win\nTHE SEATTLE BEPUBLICAN\nGEORGE V. GAU\nThe candidacy of George V. Gau for the nomina\ntion of county assessor is by no means in the hands\nof a few politicians, but like a spontaneous confli\ngration is breaking out here and there and every\nwhere, which looks very flattering to both himself\nand his friends. Mr. Gau has been a resident of\nSeattle for the past seventeen years, and during\nthat time has made and maintained a host of\nfriends, who will endeavor at their first opportunity\nto do him a good turn by casting a vote in the\nprimaries and in the convention with the view of\nnominating him for the position he is now seeking.\nFor the past two years Mr. Gau has been the bailiff\nin Judge George E. Morris\' court, and in that ca\npacity he has never made an enemy. He is strong\nin the country districts and says he has no fears of\nthe city precincts. If nominated and elected he\nwill give the county a most excellent administration.\nThe assessor\'s fight is getting to be an exceed\ningly interesting one. There are five avowed can\ndidates for the nomination and each of them have\nmore or less positive strength. The respective as\npirants are as follows: George V. Gau,\nHugh Goodfellow, Chester Eaton, W. A.\nBailey and Steve Meek. Gau is an old-time\npolitical war-horse and knows the ropes,\nand if the bunch don\'t watch him he will have votes\nto spare after he has been nominated. Chester\nEaton has had four years\' experience in the office\nand has been doing some drilling himself, and he\nmay be able to show as formidable an array of del\negates as Gau. Mr. Eaton is a "son of a veteran,"\nand will get a great deal of Grand Army strength.\nW. A. Bailey is also a very much alive candidate.\nHe has many friends throughout the county, and\nbeing a member of the Grand Army may show up\nwith a great many more votes than his opponents\nthink for. Steve Meek is simply sawing wood and\nsaying nothing, and still water runs deep. He will\nhave the Sixth ward and Dick Kinnear to start out\nwith, and that\'s a whole lot in a free-for-all fight\nin King county. Meek will have to be reckoned\nwith before the contest will have been settled\nClaude C. Ramsey will be the Fourth ward nom\ninee for the house of representatives in the next\nlegislature. Mr. Ramsey is one of the most popu\nlar young business men in the city, and would make\nan efficient lawmaker.\nAugust 10, 1906\nTwo better friends to laboring people were never\nin public life in this state than Judges Crow and\nRoot. If any demagogue thinks he can turn the\nlaboring people against them he is woefully mis\ntaken. Actions speak louder than words, Their\nprivate and public careers show an honest, loyal\nfriendship for poor people and the laboring class\nthat cannot be hidden by tricks of the enemy.\nThe Republican county central committee met\nlast Monday afternoon and decided to hold the next\ncounty convention Thursday, September 4, and the\nprimaries August 31.\nJ. Hamilton Lewis was a candidate for vice\npresident in 1900, and while in Chicago went to\nstop at a boarding house, so he says. A friend\nwho was with him said to the porter, whom they\nmet in the hall: "Jim, you\'d better be good to this\nman; he may be president some day." After look\ning Mr. Lewis over very carefull, the porter replied:\n"I hates to be disrispeckful to any of yo\' friends,\nMr. Jones, but when dis man\'s president I reckon\nI\'ll be Gawd.

CASE.', 'August 10, 190\nMuch has been said from time to time\nin the daily and weekly papers along\nthe line that the Hon. R. L. McCormick\nof Tacoma wonld be a candidate for\nUnited States senator to succeed Sena\ntor Levi Ankeny in 1909, but neither\nMr. McCormick nor anyone else with\nauthority to speak for him has made\nany declaration, one way or another, on\nthe subject. If he has any such inten\ntions he is keeping his own coun\nsel. The Seattle Republican, how\never, has recently seen a large number\nof prominent Republicans who reside\nin Western Washington, and an over\nwhelmning majority of them seem in\nclined to favor the candidacy of Mr,\nMe Cormick for United States senator\nin 1909, if he should decide to be a can\ndidate, and many of them are urging\nhim to so announce himself. The Ta\ncoma daily and weekly press favor him\nand the hold-over state senatorial as\npirants are already pledging him their\nsupport in the event he decides to be\ncome an active candidate. Support\nfrom the southwest is volunteering to\nstand pat for him, as well as from the\nnorthwest. He has many admirers in\nKing county, and owing to the general\ngood character of the man, it is barely\nprobable that half of the hold-over sen\nators, elected from King county next\nNovember, will be found supporting\nMr. McCormick for United States sen\nator in 1909.\nR.

My\ncandidacy for the nomination is subject to the en\ndorsement of the next Republican county conven\ntion.\nFOR COUNTY AUDITOR\nIn announcing my candidacy to succeed myself\nas county auditor, I do so, believing that my office\nhas given general satisfaction to the public.

With the lat\nent political strength that is daily offer\ning to become active in his interest\nthere is no doubt but that he would be\ncome a power in senatorial politics\nshould he decide to make a fight for the\nelection at the hands of the legislature\nof 1909.\n"I am not talking politics, but if R.\nL.
