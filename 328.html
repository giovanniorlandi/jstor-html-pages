Inland Revenue Commissioners \nEstate duty—Group pension policy for employees—Option to employee to take \nreduced pension continuing to widow—Pension for widow—Whether aggreg- \nable to determine rate of estate duty—Finance Act, 1894, s. 1, s. 2 (1)(d), s. 4 \nIn this case the question for the decision of the Court \nCHANCERY DIVISION was whether the rate of estate duty, payable on the value \nof a pension for the widow of an employee under a group \nWYNN-PARRY J. pension policy, should be determined by aggregation \n1950. Dec. 7. \nA.T.C. [1950] T.R. 351. \nwith other property attracting estate duty on the death \nof the employee or should be ascertained by treating the \nvalue of the pension as an estate by itself. \nThe Austin Motor Co. Ltd. (hereinafter called the company) effected with \nthe Legal and General Assurance Society Ltd. (hereinafter called the society) \ntwo separate group pension policies to provide benefits for its employees. The \npolicies had similar incidents, and it is sufficient to analyse one of them only. \nNotwithstanding that the policy was granted to the company, the benefits \nwere expressed to be payable to the persons to be ascertained from the schedule \nto the policy: and it was declared that the company should hold the policy as \ntrustee. It contained a scheduled provision that in certain circumstances an \nemployee might in lieu of a full pension elect to take a reduced pension which \nshould be payable to him during his life and after his death to his wife (to be \nnamed at the time of election) if she survived him during her life. \nThe material wording from the policy was as follows: \nClause 2. It is hereby agreed and declared that the grantees shall hold this policy \nand all benefits payable hereunder upon trust for the respective persons to whom the \nsaid benefits are expressed to be payable under and in accordance with the schedule \nhereto and that the grantees shall have no beneficial interest hereunder except in respect \nof any surrender values expressed to be payable to them under the schedule. \nClause 4. The society will pay at the principal office of the society in London to the \nperson or persons specified in the schedule hereto, on proof of existence and identity, \nthe appropriate benefit or benefits as and when the same shall fall due in accordance \nwith the terms and provisions of the schedule subject only to payment of the appropriate \npremiums as therein specified and to the general conditions set out below. \nClause 5. The receipt of any person or persons to whom any benefit or any part \nthereof is expressed to be payable under this policy shall be a good and sufficient \ndischarge to the society. \n[ 15 ] \n', 'Legal Notes \nScheduled Provision. At any time prior to normal pension date a male member may \ngive written notice to the society requiring that any pension benefit becoming payable \nto such member at normal pension date shall, after the member’s death, be paid to \na surviving wife (whose name and age must be stated in the notice) for the remainder \nof her life and for her own use and benefit. . . . \nE. L. Payton was an employee of the company who exercised, or on whose \nbehalf there was exercised, the option to take a reduced pension to be continued \nafter his death to his widow. He enjoyed the pension until his death on \n17 February 1946. \nThe learned judge said that if regard were paid only to the language of the \nscheduled provision, it appeared plain that it contemplated one continuing \npension which would continue during the life of the employee and during the \nlife of his wife if she survived him. As a matter of construction there seemed \nno doubt that the wife was intended to take, in continuation, the pension \nbenefit which the husband had been enjoying. \nThe object of the policy was, however, to provide benefits by way of pension \nfor employees. The function of the company was to make contributions which, \nwith contributions from the employees, would provide the premiums for the \nbenefits. Its only other function was to declare itself a trustee, so avoiding the \nnecessity for a separate policy for each employee. \nIf a clause on the lines of clause 2 did not find its place in the policy, \na difficulty would arise as regards the right of the respective employees to \nrecover instalments of their pensions upon any default by the society, because \nthe covenant was between the company and the society. If the company had \nnot declared itself a trustee, it would have been unable to take any effective \nstep on behalf of any employee whose pension might be in arrear. As, how- \never, the company had declared itself a trustee, it followed that, should the \nnecessity ever arise, the company on behalf of any particular beneficiary could \neffectively sue the society for damages, the measure of which would be the \namount by which the society was in default. The real obligation of the society \nwas to pay direct to the respective employees. \nThe manifest intention of the proviso was that, in the case of an employee \nwho exercised the option, the widow should be in a position to enjoy the \npension. If, however, the proviso were construed as prima facie its language \nrequired, the widow would find herself in a difficulty upon any default by the \nsociety. She had no right under the policy to sue the society. Her only course \nwould be to call upon the company to do so. Although, therefore, under \nclause 4 she was the person to whom the society had bound itself to pay, \nthat which can truly be regarded as property (i.e. the right to receive the \npension) was a right which could only arise in her after the death of her \nhusband. \nThe company was trustee of the right to sue on behalf of the employee so \nlong as he continued to be entitled to a pension, and on his death it became \ntrustee of the right to sue on behalf of the widow in respect of the benefit to \nwhich she then became entitled. \nThe learned judge said that in his view such a right did not represent \nproperty within the Finance Act, 1894, s. 1, which accordingly had no appliea- \ntion, that estate duty was payable under s. 2(1)(d), and that the widow was \nentitled to the benefit of the proviso to s, 4 under which the value of the pension \nwould be treated as an estate by itself. He declared accordingly that, an the \n[ 16 ] \n', 'Legal Notes \ntrue construction of the two policies, the values of the two pensions to the \nwidow were chargeable to estate duty under s. 2(1)(d), and that, for the \npurpose of calculating the amount of duty, each of the pensions should be \ntreated as an estate by itself. \nThe case has since been heard by the Court of Appeal, which has upheld \nthe above decision. \nIn re Brassey’s Deed Trusts, \nCoutts & Co. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners \nEstate duty—Policy of assurance—Premiums paid by trustees of settlement— \nCesser of payment of premiums—Claim on ‘slice’ of capital to produce \npremiums—Finance Act, 1894, s. 2 (1) (b) \nCHANCERY DIVISION By virtue of a deed of resettlement dated 8 August 1935 \nto which Captain Brassey, Hugo Brassey his son, and the \nROMER J. trustees were parties, it was declared that the trustees \nshould in the event which happened hold investments \n1950. Dec. 13. \n[1951] 1 Ch. 351. \nand cash upon trust (inter alia) as to capital to purchase \n[1951] 1 All E.R. 102 thereout certain policies on the life of Captain Brassey \nand as to income to pay the premiums on the policies \nand the balance of income to Hugo Brassey for life. The trusts of the policy \nmoneys were, so far as material to this note, to invest and pay the income of the \ninvestments to Hugo Brassey for life with other trusts over. \nCaptain Brassey died on 14 November 1946, whereupon the Crown claimed \nestate duty on that part of the settled fund required by the income thereof to \npay the premiums on the policies. The claim was founded on the Finance Act, \n1894, s. 2(1)(b), which provides, so far as material, that property passing on \ndeath shall be deemed to include property in which the deceased or any other \nperson had an interest ceasing on the death, to the extent to which a benefit \naccrues or arises by the cesser of such interest. \nIt was argued for the plaintiffs that on the death of Captain Brassey there \nwas no cesser of interest by reason merely of the fact that the premiums ceased. \nThe interest of Hugo Brassey remained, as before, a life interest, and the \ninterest of the remaindermen continued to be a right in reversion to the \ncorpus. \nThe learned judge said that while the remaindermen neither had before nor \nhad now any right to call on the trustees to transfer capital, it was not accurate \nto say that they had no further right, for they were at all times entitled as \ncestuis que trust to insist that the trustees should, during the life of Captain \nBrassey, apply a sufficient part of the income to pay the premiums. They could \nin other words compel the trustees to divert income from the life tenant and \npay premiums which would ultimately enure for their benefit. \nIt followed in his judgment that the remaindermen had an interest within \ns. 2 (1) (b) in the capital and income of the trust fund, and that estate duty was \npayable on that part of the trust fund formerly required by the income thereof \nto pay the premiums, the proportion being ascertained by comparing the gross \nincome required to produce, after deduction of tax, the net amount of the \npremiums with the total gross income of the trust fund. \nThe case is under appeal. \n[ 17 ] 6 -2 \n', 'Legal Notes \nIn re Smith’s Settlement Trusts, \nExecutor Trustee and Agency Co. of South Australia Ltd. \nand Others v. Inland Revenue Commissioners \nEstate duty-Exemption of certain British Government securities—Beneficial \nownership of persons neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the United \nKingdom—Life tenant so domiciled and resident—Remaindermen not so \ndomiciled and resident-Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, s. 47, Finance (No. 2) \nAct, 1931, S. 22(1) \nCHANCERY DIVISION The Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, s. 47, and the Finance \n(No. 2) Act, 1931, s. 22 (1), provide that securities may be \nDANCKWERTS J, issued by the Treasury with a condition that neither the \ncapital nor the income shall be liable to any taxation, \n1950. Dec.13. \n[1951] 1 Ch.360. \npresent or future, so long as the securities are in the \n[1951] 1 All E.R. 146. beneficial ownership of persons who are neither domiciled \nnor ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. \nThe benefit of the exemption was allowed on the issue of 5% War Loan \n1929-47, subsequently converted to 39% War Loan 1952 or later, and on the \nissue of 4% Funding Loan 1960-90. \nHoldings of both issues formed part of trust funds in certain settlements made \ninter vivos, under which the life tenant was a woman domiciled and ordinarily \nresident in the United Kingdom. The life tenant died on 17 October 1946, \nwhereupon the trust funds became divisible in part to persons domiciled and \nordinarily resident in Australia. \nOn the death of the life tenant estate duty became payable on the settled \nfunds except in so far as the benefit of exemption could be properly claimed. \nThe material wording in the two Acts is similar. The 1915 Act provides: \nThe Treasury may, if they think fit, during the continuance of the present war and \na period of twelve months thereafter, issue any securities which they have power to \nissue for the purpose of raising any money or any loan with a condition that neither the \ncapital nor the interest thereof shall be liable to any taxation, present or future, so long \nas it is shown in manner directed by the Treasury that the securities are in the beneficial \nownership of persons who are neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the United \nKingdom, and securities issued with such a condition shall be exempt accordingly. \nThe provisions of the prospectus are much the same for each issue and for \nthe 5% War Loan 1929-47 are as follows: \nStocks and bonds of these loans and the dividends payable from time to time in \nrespect thereof will be exempt from all British taxation, present or future, if it is shown \nin the manner directed by the Treasury that they are in the beneficial ownership of \na person who is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom of \nGreat Britain and Ireland. Further, the dividends payable from time to time in respect \nof stock and bonds of these loans will be exempt from British income tax, present or \nfuture, if it is shown in the manner directed by the Treasury that the stock or bonds \nare in the beneficial ownership of a person who is not ordinarily resident in the United \nKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, without regard to the question of domicil. Where \na bond belongs to a holder entitled to exemption under these provisions the relative \ncoupons will be paid without deduction for income tax or other taxes, if accompanied \nby a declaration of ownership in such form as may be required by the Treasury. \nIn these circumstances it was claimed that the exemptions applied in so far \nas the securities in question passed on the death of the life tenant to persons \n[ 18 ] \n', 'Legal Notes \nbeneficially entitled who were neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the \nUnited Kingdom. \nThe view taken officially by the Inland Revenue Commissioners is stated in \nGreen’s Death Duties, 2nd ed. p. 632, as follows: \nExemption, so long as the property is in a particular ownership, is more appropriate \nto income tax than to death duties, which relate to a change of ownership. The official \nview is that regard must be had, on the death of an absolute owner or a life tenant, only \nto his domicil, etc., and not to the domicil, etc., of the living beneficiaries. \nThe learned judge said that it is not until the life tenant is dead that there \ncan be any passing or any charge to estate duty. So long as the life tenant was \nstill alive, even though she were in extremis, no claim for estate duty could be \nmade. It was only when she died that the property passed and the liability to \nestate duty arose. The beneficial ownership of the life tenant could not be the \ntest because when the event occurred the life tenant had already died. It \nseemed to him that the death was the cause which gave rise to the passing and \nto the liability for estate duty, so that there was some slight, even if almost im- \nperceptible, period of time after the death before the liability to estate duty arose. \nIt was argued for the Crown that estate duty is a tax in respect of which the \nnature of the person succeeding is irrelevant, but the learned judge pointed \nout that he was dealing with two sections which in their terms are concerned \nwith beneficial ownership, so that, whatever might be the general nature of \nestate duty, the Court and the Inland Revenue were compelled in the present \ncase to consider the beneficial interests. \nIt was pointed out by counsel for the Crown that where such securities \nwere not specifically bequeathed by will but formed part of the estate of \na deceased person, there would be no person who at the death could claim \na beneficial ownership because, while the estate was under administration, \nthe persons who would eventually take the residuary estate could not assert \na title to any particular asset. In the case, moreover, of a specific legacy, it was \nsuggested that the legatee had no absolute right to the legacy at the date of \ndeath of the testator. The learned judge said, however, that the fact that there \nmight be difficulties in other cases did not dispose of the matter if the case \nbefore him fitted the words in the sections of the Acts. It seemed to him that \nin the present case the passing of the securities to beneficiaries domiciled and \nordinarily resident outside the United Kingdom brought the securities within \nthe terms of the exemption and that the claim for exemption must succeed. \nReference should be made to the Finance Bill, 1951, s. 30. \nIn re d’Avigdor-Goldsmid’s Life Policy, \nd’Avigdor-Goldsmid V. Inland Revenue Commissioners \nEstate duty—Money received under policy kept up for donee—Ultimate donee— \nInterest accruing or arising by survivorship—Purchased or provided by person \nwho has received resources from deceased—Finance Act, 1894, s. 2(1)(C), \ns. 2(1) (d)—Finance Act, 1939, s. 30 \nCHANCERY DIVISION In this case the question for the decision of the Court \nVAISEY J. was whether, at the death on 14 April 1940 of Sir Osmond \n1950. Dec. 20. d’Avigdor-Goldsmid, estate duty became payable in \n[1951] 1 Ch. 321. \n[1951] 1 All E.R. 240. \nrespect of the whole or part of £48,765, the policy money \nunder a policy effected on 3 May 1904 by Sir Osmond \non his own life with the Royal Insurance Company Ltd. \n[ 19 ] \n', 'Legal Notes \nBy his marriage settlement dated 23 October 1907 Sir Osmond settled \nfreehold property, investments and the policy on trusts under which he took \na protected life interest in part of the freehold property and, after his death, \nsubject to a jointure rent charge for the wife, certain of the freehold property \nwas settled in tail male. Sir Osmond covenanted to pay the premiums on the \npolicy, and the settlement provided that at his death the policy money should \nbe invested in the purchase of freehold property to be held upon the same \ntrusts as those declared in respect of that part of the settled freehold property \nin which Sir Osmond had a protected life interest. \nBy a private Act of Parliament entitled the Goldsmid Estate Act, 1928, \nSir Osmond was empowered, notwithstanding his protected life interest, to \njoin in a disentailing deed, and, by virtue of various deeds dated 10 June 1930, the \ntrust funds and the policy were resettled. Under the resettlement Sir Osmond \nagain covenanted to pay the premiums on the policy. \nBy a deed of appointment dated 10 November 1934 Sir Osmond and his \neldest son, Sir Henry, jointly exercised a power of appointment reserved to \nthem under the resettlement, and declared that the policy and certain freehold \nproperty known as 27 Wood Street should be held upon trust for Sir Henry \nabsolutely, and by the same deed Sir Henry released Sir Osmond from his \ncovenant to pay the premiums on the policy. The effect of the appointment \nwas that Sir Henry became the absolute beneficial owner of the policy and of \nthe Wood Street property. \nDuring the currency of the policy 37 premiums in all were paid as follows: \n4 by Sir Osmond for his own benefit before the marriage settlement. \n23 by Sir Osmond for the benefit of persons interested under the marriage \nsettlement. \n4 by Sir Osmond for the benefit of persons interested under the \nresettlement. \n6 by Sir Henry for his own benefit after he became the absolute owner \nof the policy. \nOn the death of Sir Osmond the Crown claimed estate duty either under the \nFinance Act, 1894, s. 2(1)(c) or under the Finance Act, 1894, s. 2 (1)(d) as \nextended by the Finance Act, 1939, s. 30. \nThe Finance Act, 1894, s. 2(1)(c), by reference brings into charge to estate \nduty: \nMoney received under a policy of assurance effected by any person dying on or after \n1 June 1889, on his life, where the policy is wholly kept up by him for the benefit of \na donee, whether nominee or assignee, or a part of such money in proportion to the \npremiums paid by him where the policy is partially kept up by him for such benefit. \nThe claim of the Crown in so far as it was based on s. 2 (1) (c) was accordingly \nlimited to estate duty on a proportion of the policy money. \nOn this part of the case Vaisey J. said that in his view the donee referred to \nin the Act is the ultimate donee, and that the reference to a donee is not \nproperly applicable to a series of donees and signifies the final beneficiary and \nowner of the policy. He took the view that the fact that Sir Henry was one of \na number of beneficiaries under the earlier settlements had no bearing on the \nquestion, and that the policy had not been kept up by Sir Osmond for the \nbenefit of Sir Henry. Following therefore Lord Advocate v. Fleming (1897) \n[ 20] \n', 'Legal Notes \nA.C. 145 he held that the claim of the Crown under the Finance Act, 1894, \ns. 2(1)(C), failed. \nThe learned judge then turned to the claim under the Finance Act, 1894, \ns. 2(1)(d), which charges to estate duty: \nAny annuity or other interest purchased or provided by the deceased, either by himself \nalone or in concert or by arrangement with anyother person, to the extent of the beneficial \ninterest accruing or arising by survivorship or otherwise on the death of the deceased. \nThe charge under the subsection has been extended by the Finance Act, \n1939, s. 30, as follows: \nThe Finance Act 1894 s. 2(1)(d). . . shall have effect in relation to an annuity or \nother interest that was purchased or provided wholly or in part by any person who was \nat any time entitled to, or amongst whose resources there was at any time included, \nany property derived from the deceased, as if that annuity or other interest had been \nprovided by the deceased, or, if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioners \nthat the application of all the property derived from the deceased would have been \ninsufficient to provide the whole of that annuity or other interest, as if a similar annuity \nor interest of an amount reduced to an extent proportionate to the insufficiency \nproved had been provided by the deceased: \nProvided that for the purpose of determining whether there would have been any \nsuch insufficiency as aforesaid, and the extent thereof, there shall be excluded from the \nproperty derived from the deceased any part thereof as to which it is proved to the \nsatisfaction of the Commissioners that the disposition of which it, or the property which \nit represented, was the subject matter was not made with reference to, or with a view \nto enabling or facilitating, the purchase or provision of the annuity or other interest, \nor the recoupment in any manner of the cost thereof. \nOn this part of the case the learned judge regarded himself as bound by \nLord Advocate v. Hamilton’s Trustees (1942) S.C. 426, where Lord Wark \nobserved, first, that the claim in that case was made under head (d) and not \nunder head (c), secondly, that it was not disputed that head (d) might render \nsubject to duty insurance policies and policy moneys which escape under \nhead (c), and thirdly, that the words ‘other interest’ in head (d) are sufficiently \nwide to include the right to a policy or policy moneys. Lord Wark then said that \nhe found it difficult to understand how head (d) could catch the very case with \nwhich head (c) deals, i.e. the case of an out-and-out transfer of a policy by \nway of gift, and make the interest in such policy liable to duty whether the \npolicy be kept up by a donor for the benefit of the donee or not. He added \nthat if that were a sound view it seemed to him that head (c) was otiose. He \nsaid that the claim of the Crown failed because it was not shown that any \nbeneficial interest accrued or arose on the death of the deceased, and he \npointed out that the whole interest in the policies and the policy moneys had \nin that case passed to the beneficiaries twenty-four years before the death of \nthe deceased. Their interest then was fully vested and was neither altered nor \nincreased by the death of the deceased. The nature of the interest was the \nsame, although the value of it was increasing during the lifetime of the assured \nand reached its maximum at his death. \nVaisey J. then quoted the following passage from the judgment of Lord Wark: \nComing to consider the language of s. 2(1)(d), it is apparent hat, in order to succeed, \nthe Crown must establish two things: first, that the property sought to be charged has \nbeen provided or purchased by the deceased, either by himself alone or in concert or \nby arrangement with any other person; and, second, that to some extent there has been \na beneficial interest arising or accruing by survivorship or otherwise on the death of \nthe deceased. If either of these is not established, the claim fails. And it is well to keep \n[ 21 ] \n', 'Legal Notes \nin view the elementary principle of construction of taxing statutes that it is for the \nCrown to show that the subject is within the ambit of the statute and not for the subject \nto show that he is outside it. Having regard to what I have said as to s. 2(1)(c), I think \nthere is soundness in the argument for the respondents that, where you are dealing with \npolicy moneys, it is not sufficient to bring them within the expression ‘purchased or \nprovided by the deceased’ that the policy was originally taken out by him, or even that \ncertain premiums were paid by him upon it, if it has been assigned to a donee and the \nassured has thereafter paid no further premiums. And, in my opinion, this is true, even \nwhen the gift is made through the medium of a trust, so long as it is not one of the \npurposes of the trust to make payment of the premiums out of funds provided by the \ntruster. The argument for the Crown amounted to this, that the deceased had in effect \nprovided the premiums after the date of the declaration of trust by creating a trust and \nempowering the trustees to borrow upon the trust property, which was of sufficient \nvalue to afford security for the further premiums required. Alternatively, it was said \nthat the trustees were his mandataries to pay the premiums. I do not think this argu- \nment is sound in either alternative. The trustees were trustees, not for the deceased, \nbut for the beneficiaries. They were answerable to them alone, and, when they borrowed, \nit was in their interest and on their behalf. They were not directed to borrow, but only \nempowered to do so. They might have surrendered the policies, or some of them, at \nany time. Accordingly, the further premiums required were paid truly by the bene- \nficiaries entirely, and not by the deceased. \nThe learned judge said that the latter part of the passage quoted seemed to \nhim to dispose of any claim that might have been based on the Finance Act, \n1939, s. 30, in reference to the Wood Street property as affecting the policy. \nThe policy in his view was essentially the same in character as any other \nproperty which is capable of absolute and unfettered ownership. Sir Henry \ncould have sold it, mortgaged it, given it away, destroyed it, settled it, or \n(it being a policy on his father’s life) he could have surrendered it at the moment \nwhen his father was in extremis at the point of death. In the case of none of \nthese possible dealings could the present claims have been established. \nVaisey J. said that the authorities are difficult to reconcile, and it might well \nbe that Lord Advocate v. Hamilton’s Trustees (supra) is inconsistent with \nAttorney General v. Dobree (1900) 1 Q.B. 442, Attorney General v. Robinson \n(1901) 2 I.R. 67 and Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Scott’s Trustees (1918) \nSC. 720, but he thought himself bound to follow it and to declare that no \nestate duty became payable at the death of Sir Osmond on the policy money. \nThe case has been heard by the Court of Appeal. Judgment was reserved. \nCole v. Milsome \nCheque payable to ‘cash or order ‘—Not equivalent to a direction to pay to bearer \n—Not negotiable as a bill of exchange—Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, s. 3 (1) \n—Cheque dishonoured—Drawer not liable to holder—Cheque payable to \na specified person—Cheque dishonoured—Consideration necessary to support \naction by payee against drawer \nKING’S BENCH \nDIVISION \nThis was an action brought by the plaintiff, Mrs Cole, \nagainst the defendant, Miss Milsome, in respect of two \nLLOYD–JACOB J. cheques drawn by the latter and dishonoured on \npresentation. \n1950. Dec. 18. \n[9511 ] All E.R. 311. The plaintiff was in the employ of one Hignett, and \npart of her employment was dealing on his behalf with \nmatters involving money. The cheques in question were brought to the \n[ 22 ] \n', "Legal Notes \nplaintiff by Hignett with a request that she pay them into her bank account \nand draw against it a number of cheques to meet various commitments of his. \nThe first cheque was for the sum of £137. 10s. It was drawn by the \ndefendant on an ordinary cheque form with the printed words ‘pay’ and \n‘or order', and between them the word ‘cash’ was inserted in ink. The \nplaintiff endorsed it and paid it into her bank. She had drawn cheques on \nher account as directed by Hignett, to a total amounting substantially to the \namount of the cheque paid in, before she received notice of its dishonour. As \na third-party holder of the cheque she could only recover against the defendant \nif it was negotiable as a bill of exchange, and the question was whether it fell \nwithin the definition of a bill of exchange in subsection 3 (1) of the Bills of \nExchange Act, 1882, which reads as follows: \nA bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writing addressed by one person to \nanother, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed \nto pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time a sum certain in money to \nor to the order of a specified person or to bearer. \nThe document could qualify as a bill of exchange only if the words ‘pay \ncash or order’ could be read as indicating payment to bearer. The learned \njudge said that there was no precise authority on that point, and in the absence \nof such authority he had with some reluctance come to the conclusion that \nthe words could not fairly be so constructed. In these circumstances the \nplaintiff’s claim on the first cheque failed. \nThe second cheque was for the sum of £165. It was made payable to the \nplaintiff. When it was brought to her by Hignett she was ignorant of the fact \nthat the first cheque had been dishonoured, and she paid it into her bank \naccount and drew cheques on her account as directed by Hignett to a total \namounting substantially to the amount of the cheque paid in. It was conceded \nby the defendant with regard to this document that it was a bill of exchange \nreceived in good faith by the plaintiff, but it was contended that the plaintiff \nwas not in a position to recover against the defendant in respect of it because \nthere had been no consideration as between the plaintiff and the defendant \nfor its transmission. The learned judge said that in the circumstances which \nhappened this cheque was delivered to the plaintiff by Hignett as agent for \nthe defendant with an admitted request that the plaintiff should draw cheques \non her account in respect substantially of the total. The receipt of the cheque, \nits endorsement by the plaintiff, its payment into her bank and the drawing by \nher of cheques against the amount were made by her pursuant (as she believed) \nto an implied request by the defendant that the cheque should be utilized for \nthe purpose which Hignett was representing to her was the purpose of its \ntransmission to her. The plaintiff was moved and actuated by the representa- \ntions of Hignett which she believed he was making as agent for the person \nwho had drawn the cheque. In these circumstances the learned judge could \nnot hold that the completion of the cheque by the defendant amounted to \nnothing more than a voluntary promise on her part. He must read into the \ntransaction the necessary business implications which followed from the \ntransmission of a document drawn in that form to the expressed payee in the \ncircumstances stated, and that there was sufficient consideration moving from \nthe plaintiff to the defendant to support the action on the cheque. \nIn the result the plaintiff was entitled to recover the sum of £165 from the \ndefendant. \n[ 23 ] \n", 'Legal Notes \nIn re Smallwood (deceased) \nInheritance (Family Provision) Act, 1938, s. 1(7)— Testator’s reasons for his \ntestamentary provisions— What evidence is admissible \nCHANCERY DIVISION \nROXBURGH J. \n1951. Jan.22. \n[1951] 1 Ch.369. \n[1951] 1 All E.R. 372. \nThis was an application made by the widow of the \ntestator for provision to be made for her out of the \ntestator’s estate under the Inheritance (Family Provision) \nAct, 1938. The Act provides that where a person dies \ndomiciled in England leaving a wife or husband or \na child or children dependent on him or her for support \nand has made a will which in the opinion of the Court \ndoes not make a reasonable provision for his, her or their maintenance, the \nCourt may order a reasonable provision to be made out of the testator’s estate, \nBy subsection 1 (7) of the Act the Court is directed to have regard to the \ntestator’s reasons so far as ascertainable for making the provisions made by \nhis will or for not making any provision for a dependent, and may accept such \nevidence of those reasons as it considers sufficient, including any statement in \nwriting signed by the testator and dated. \nThe question for the Court was whether a statement in writing made by \none of the testator’s sons was admissible in evidence. The statement included \ninter alia what the testator had told his son on various occasions with regard \nto the conduct of the applicant and the unhappy relationship which existed \nbetween, the testator and his wife, and the complaints which the testator made \nto his son about his wife’s conduct and how he was in the habit of spending \nweek-ends with his son or his daughter in order to escape from her and how \nmuch he dreaded going back to her. \nCounsel for the widow objected to the admissibility of the statement because \n(1) it was not a statement of the testator’s reasons for making the provision in \nhis will and (2) it was not a statement in writing made by the testator. \nOn the first point the learned judge said that at first sight he would have \nthought that the point was a good one and that subsection 1 (7) was directed \nto statements by the testator of his reasons and did not extend to statements by \nthe testator of facts which the Court might hold to have constituted his \nreasons. He thought, however, that in what is in any view a difficult point \nhe ought to follow the decision of Bennett J. in In re Vrint (1940) Ch. 920, \nand hold that the subsection is not confined to evidence of the reasons given by \nthe testator for making the dispositions made by the will or for not making any \nprovision or any further provision (as the case might be) but extends to \nevidence of facts from which the Court could infer the reasons of the testator. \nOn the second point the learned judge said that it was covered by the \ndecision In re Vrint, but even if the point were open he considered that the \nwords of the section ‘such evidence. . .as it considers sufficient’ are as wide \nas they could be, and although it was rather surprising that there should in \nthese circumstances have been added the words ‘including any statement in \nwriting signed by the testator and dated,’ he could not think that by reason of \nthose words the generality of the words ‘such evidence of those reasons as it \nconsiders sufficient’ had to be curtailed. \nThe statement was therefore admissible as evidence of the testator’s \nreasons. \n[ 24 ] \n', 'Legal Notes \nCandler v. Crane Christmas and Co. \nAccountant-Negligent preparation of company’s accounts and balance sheet—  \nFalse statement of financial position—Purchase of shares on faith of statement \n-Liquidation of company-Accountant’s liability to Shareholder—No con- \ntractual or confidential relationship \nCOURT OF APPEAL In this action the plaintiff claimed damages from the \ndefendants, a firm of accountants and auditors, on the \nCOHEN, ASQUITH AND ground of their negligence in the preparation of the \nDENNING L. JJ. accounts and balance sheet of a company called Trevan- \n1951. Jan.26. \nance Hydraulic Tin Mines Ltd. He alleged that the \n[1951] 1 All E.R. 426. accounts and balance sheet contained a false statement \nof the company’s financial position which induced him \nto invest £2000 in the purchase of shares. On the subsequent liquidation of \nthe company the shares became valueless. \nThe plaintiff’s case was (1) that since to the knowledge of the defendant’s \nemployee, who prepared the accounts and balance sheet, the plaintiff was \na prospective investor in the company, and was asking for information about \nthe accounts of the company to assist him in reaching a decision whether to \nmake the investment, the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff when giving \nhim that information to exercise care to see that it was accurate; (2) that since \nthe information given to the plaintiff was inaccurate in material particulars \nowing to the negligence of the defendants’ employee, the defendants were \nliable in damages. Alternatively, the plaintiff alleged that as he became \na shareholder in the company and the defendants were the auditors of the \ncompany, they owed a duty to him as shareholder to give him the accurate \ninformation which they should have given him when he was a prospective \ninvestor. That duty he said was not discharged, and accordingly he was \nentitled to damages. \nThe Court of Appeal (Denning L. J. dissenting) held on the main argument \nthat, in the absence of a contractual or confidential relationship between the \nplaintiff and the defendant firm, the latter owed no duty to the plaintiff to \nexercise care in the preparation of the accounts and balance sheet. Such \nnexus of proximity as existed was insufficient to establish any such duty. \nOn the alternative argument no damage flowed from the breach of such duty \nas was owed by the defendants to the plaintiff as a shareholder. The £2000 \nhad been irretrievably invested before the relationship had become operative. \nIt was further doubtful whether the defendants’ alleged duty as auditors \ncovered information given to the plaintiff before he became a shareholder. \nOn these grounds Lloyd-Jacob J. in the Court below had dismissed the \nplaintiff’s claim for damages, and the Court of Appeal now dismissed the \nplaintiff’s appeal from that order. \nNote \nDiplock’s Estate, In re \nDecision of the Court of Appeal [1948] Ch. 465 reported in J.I.A.
