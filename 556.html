In a\nlarge lot, where he distinctly remem\nbered a tenement house, there was\nonly an enormous heap of debris.\n"Cracky !" murmured Crink. "Wa\'n\'t\nthat a grand fire? Here\'s where I get\nbusy."\na new\nHe hid his basket behind\nof shattered masonry and plunged\nInto exploration of the highest mound\nof ashes. Crlnk lived the life of sal\nvage. A bit of human wreckage him\nself, he had an unfailing attraction\nfor all the material wreckage that\ncame within range. Young as he was,\nthe boy was an expert with a bent\npiece of iron, flicking scrap heaps for\nthose fragments which have been\nthrown out, not because their\nness ls exhausted but because their\nowners have been lacking in ingenu\nity.

He grabbed It, but\nat the same moment another hand\nalso grabbed—n small, thin hand. A\npair of bright black eyes confronted\nCrlnk, the eyes of a girl about\na mass\nuseful\nhis own\nage who had been conducting a series\nof Investigations of her\nrear of the lot.\n"Hey, leggo there," cried Crlnk.\n"Leggo yourself," retorted the girt.\n"Shan\'t.

We have long since realized that the basis of an\nadvancing civilization must be a high and growing standard of living for\nail the people, not for a single class; that education, food, clothing,\nhousing, and the spreading use of what we so often term nonessentials,\nthe real fertilizers of the soil from which spring the finer flowers\nof life. The economic development of the past fifty years has lifted the\ngeneral standard of comfort far beyond the dreams of our forefathers.\nThe only road to further ad\\ ance in the standard of living is bv greater\ninvention, greater production and better distribution of commodities and\nservices, for by increasing their ratio to our numbers and dividing them\neach will have more of them.\nshould\nT\nare\nTbe superlative value of\nism through Its impulse to production.\nstimulation to Invention, has, so\nfar as I know, never been denied.\nCriticism of it has lain in Its wastes\nbut more Importantly In Its failures of\nequitable sharing of the product. In\ncountry these contentions are main\ntbe division to each of his\n!\'-■\nour\nly over\nshare of the comforts and luxuries, for\nof us is either hungry or cold\nwithout a place to lay his head—and\nhave much besides. In less than\nfour decades we have added electric\nlights, plumbing, telephones, gramo\nautomobiles, and what not In\nnone\nor\nVI\nphones,\nwide diffusion to our standards of liv\ning. Each In turn began as a luxury,\neach In turn has become so common\nplace that seventy or eighty per cent\nof our people participate In them.\nTo all practical souls there is little\nIn quarreling over the share of\neach of us until we have something to\nSo long as we maintain our\ndivide.\nindividualism we will have increasing\nquantities to share and we shall have\ntime and leisure and taxes with which\nto fight out proper sharing of the "sur\nplus." The income tax returns show\nthat this surplus Is a minor part of our\ntotal production after taxes are paid.\nSome of this "surplus" must be set\naside for rewards to saving, or stimula\ntion of proper effort to skill, to leader\nship and Invention—therefore the dis\npute Is in reality over much less than\nthe total of such "surplus." While there\nshould be no minimizing of a certain\nfringe of injustices in sharing the re\nsults of production or in the wasteful\nuse made by some of their share, yet\nthere is vastly wider field for gains to\nall of us through cheapening the costs\nof production and distribution through\nthe eliminating of their wastes, from\nIncreasing the volume of product by\neach and every one doing his utmost,\nthan will ever come to us even If we\ncan think out a method of abstract\nJustice In sharing which did not stifle\nproduction of the total product.\nIt Is a certainty we are confronted\nwith a population ln such numbers as\ncan only exist by production attuned\nto a pitch In which the slightest reduc\ntion of the Impulse to produce will at\nonce create misery and want. If we\nthrottle the fundamental Impulses of\nman our production will decay. The\nworld In this hour Is witnessing the\nmost overshadowing tragedy of ten\ncenturies in the heart-breaking llfe\nand-death struggle with starvation by\na nation with a hundred and fifty mil\nlions of people. In Russia under the\nnew tyranny a group, in pursuit of so\ncial theories, hove destroyed the pri\nmary self-interest Impulse of the indi\nvidual to production.\nAlthough socialism in a nation-wide\napplication has now proved Itself with\nrivers of blood and inconceivable mis\nery to be an economic and spiritual fal\nlacy and has wrecked Itself finally up\non the rocks of destroyed production\nand moral degeneracy, I believe it to\nhave been necessary for the world to\nthis demonstration. Great\ntheoretic and emotional ideas have\narisen before In the world\'s history and\nhave In more than mere material bank\nruptcy deluged the world with fearful\nlosses of life. A purely philosophical\nview might be that In the long run hu\nmanity has to try every way, even\nprecipices, In finding the road to bet\nterment\nBut those are utterly- wrong who say\nthat Individualism lias as Its only end\nthe acquisition and preservation of prl\n\'ute property—the selfish snatching\nand boarding of the common product,\nuur American Individualism, indeed,\nis only lu Da rt an economic creed It\nalum ** J an economic er« eu. «\nl "\'""T"""\' 7.\nJKÄSwTJrti SSïïtïî\nr\nout tl , M üf f UOt T\nI the noticn that we give property\n- "" \'Tf/I\ndetelnpuieut of ludivlduulUu.\nneu\nIp\neve\nrigi\n• I\n«bows\niu liKTi\'uslng tendency tu t\nf properly not us uu obj\n10 I he l.glU of\nr\nKl*!\nUatrfuJ Mid\nof\nMi toll\nUUUtlt in\nI,\n*\nIndividual-*—----\nuse of capital by crushing the Initia\ntive that makes for Its creation.\nSome discussion of the legal limita\ntions we have placed upon economic\ndomination is given later od, but It Is\ndesirable to mention here certain po\ntent forces In our economic life that\nare themselves providing their\ncorrection to domination.\nThe domination by arbitrary Individ\nual ownership is disappearing because\nthe works of today are steadily grow\ning more and more beyond the\nsources of any one individual, and\nsteadily taxation will reduce relatively\nexcessive Individual\nThe number of persons In partnership\nthrough division of ownership\nmany stockholders Is steadily Increas\ning—thus 100,000 to 200,000 partners In\na single concern are not uncommon.\nThe overwhelmingly largest portion of\nour mobile capital Is that of\nbanks, Insurance companies, building\nahd loan associations, and the vast\njorlty of all this Is the aggregated\nsmall savings of our people. Thus\nlarge capital Is steadily becoming more\nand more a mobilization of the savings\nof the small holders—the actual people\nthemselves—and its administration be\ncomes at once more sensitive to the\nmoral opinions of the people In order\nto attract their support. The directors\nand managers of large concerns, them\nselves employees of these great groups\nof Individual stockholders, or policy\nholders, reflect a spirit of community\nown\nre\naccumulations.\namong\nour\nma\nLarge masses of capital can only\nfind their market for service or produc\ntion to great numbers of the same\nkind of people that they employ and\nthey must, therefore, maintain confi\ndence In their public responsibilities In\norder to retain their customers. In\ntimes when the products of manufac\nture were mostly luxuries to the aver\nage of the people, the condition of\ntheir employees was of no such Inter\nest to their customers as w\'hen they\ncater to employees In generaL Of\nthis latter, no greater proofs need ex\nist than the efforts of many large con\ncerns directly dependent upon public\ngood will to restrain prices in scarcity\n—and the very general desire to yield\na measure of service with the goods\nsold. Another phase of this same de\nvelopment In administration of capital\nIs the growth of a sort of institutional\nsense in many large business enter\nprises. The encouragement of solidar\nity in all grades of their employees In\nthe common service and common suc\ncess. the sense of mutuality with the\nprosperity of the community are both\nvital developments In individualism.\nThere has been In the last thirty\nyears an extraordinary growth of or\nganizations for advancement of Ideas\nin the community for mutual co-opera\ntion and economic objectives—the\nchamber« of commerce, trade associa\ntions, labor unions, bankers, farmers,\npropaganda associations, and what not.\nThese are Indeed variable mixtures of\naltruism and self-interest. Neverthe\nless In these groups the individual finds\nopportunity for self-expression and\nparticipation in the molding of idées, a\nfield for training and the stepping\nstones for leadership.\nan\nThe number of leaders In local and\nnational lire whose opportunity to\nservice and leadership came through\nthese associations has become now of\nImportance than those through\nthe direct lines of political and reli\nj\ni\nsharp conflict and often enough charge\neach other with crimes against publ c\n^ Jo cou t u i u faults; If\nw.rrln, lat«,.:.

Those\nwho either congratulate themselves or\nthose who fear that co-operation Is an\nadvance toward socialism need neither\nrejoice or worry. Co-operation In Its\ncurrent economic sense represents the\nInitiative of self-interest blended with\na sense of service, for nobody belongs\nto a co-operatKe who Is not striving\nto sell his products or services for\nmore or striving to buy from others\nfor less or striving to make his income\nmore secure. Their members are fur\nnishing the capital for extension of\ntheir activities just as effectively as If\nthey did It In corporate form and they\nare simply transferring the profit prin\nciple from joint return to Individual\nreturn.\nTheir only success lies where\nthey eliminate waste either In produc\ntion or distribution—and they can do\nneither if they destroy Individual Initi\native.\nIndeed this phase of develop\nment of our Individualism promises to\nbecome the dominant note of its Twen\ntieth century expansion. But It will\nthrive only in so far as It can con\nstruct leadership and a sense of serv\nice, and so long as It preserves the In\nitiative and safeguards the Individual\nity of its members.\nThe economic system which Is the\nresult of our Individualism Is not a\nfrozen organism. It moves rapidly In\nIts form of organization under the Im\npulse of Initiative of our citizens, of\ngrowing science, of larger production,\nand of constantly cheapening distribu\ntion.\nA great test of the soundness of a\nsocial system must be Its ability to\nevolve within Itself those orderly shifts\nin Its administration that enable It to\napply the new tools of social, economic,\nand intellectual progress, and to elimi\nnate the malign forces that may grow\nIn the application of these tools. When\nwe were almost wholly an agricultural\npeople our form of organization and\nadministration, both In the govern\nmental and economic fields, could be\nsimple. With the enormous shift In\ngrowth to Industry and commerce we\nhave erected organisms that each gene\nration has denounced as Franken\nsteins, yet the succeeding generation\nproves them to be controllable and\nuseful. The growth of corporate or\nganizations, of our banking systems, of\nour railways, of our electrical power,\nof our farm co-operatives, of our trade\nunions, of our trade associations, and\nof a hundred others Indeed develops\nboth beneficent and malign forces. The\ntimid become frightened. But our\nbasic social ideas march through the\nnew things in the end. Our dema\ngogues, of both radical and\nbreed, thrive on demands for the de\nstruction of one or another of these\norganizations as the only solution for\ntheir defects, yet progress requires\nonly a guardianship of the vital princi\nples of our individualism with its safe\nguard of true equality of opportunity\nIn them.\n(TO BE CONTINUED.)\n(Copyright. 1923, by Doubleday.
