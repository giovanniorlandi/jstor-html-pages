Social and Biological\nFactors in Infant Mortality.\nA series of articles reporting an inquiry into the stillbirths and infant deaths\nof 1949 and 1950 in England and Wales. This inquiry describes the contemporary\nrange of mortality rates and uses the lowest to indicate a goal\nwhich can be achieved in the present state of medical knowledge. ' Vulnerable'\ngroups with particularly unfavourable rates are defined in various\nbiological and social terms—age, family size, social class, occupation of\nfather—and the effects of each are separated as far as possible. The persistence\nof social class differences in mortality indicates that there is a time\nlag before the effect of social improvements is shown in lighter mortality.\nBiometrika, Vol. 42, Parts 1 and 2, June 1955\nDAVID, F. N. Studies in the History of Probability and Statistics. I. Dicing and\nGaming.\nThis is the first of a series of articles dealing with the history of probability\nand statistics. It is concerned with dicing and gaming from the earliest\ntimes until about the middle of the seventeenth century. The contributions\nof Cardano and Galileo to probability theory are mentioned, and the author\nconcludes that Huygens was the first to crystallize the ideas of mathematicians\non this subject and thereby earned the right to be regarded as\nits father.\nPopulation Studies, Vol. 8, No. 3, March 1955\nBENJAMIN, B. Quality of Response in Census Taking.\nThe paper discusses sources and methods of evaluation of errors in census\ndata and gives a preliminary account of the size and direction of errors so\nfar revealed by analysis of the 1951 Census schedules, with special reference\nto the new topics introduced for the first time in 1951, e.g. school-leaving\nage and household arrangements. The value of pre-census sampling trials\nfor testing concepts and definitions is stressed.\nNew Biology, No. 18, April 1955\nCOMFORT, ALEX. The Biology of Old Age.\nThis article is written in popular style but is nevertheless a serious discussion\nof the biological meaning of senescence and of the difference\nbetween the length of life and the quality of survival—a difference which\n", "Articles and Papers of Actuarial Interest 311\nis of considerable economic importance. The removal of successive causes\nof death has not produced the increase in the average age at death which\nwould be expected to follow. Most people who die late in life from a\nspecific cause also exhibit several other disease processes which would\nprobably have killed them very soon had they survived the actual cause of\ntheir death. This developmental problem has to be solved in achieving a\ngeneral prolongation of active life.\nThe Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 22 (2), No. 58, 1954-55\nSAUNDERS, C. T . Some problems in the Estimation of Personal Savings and\nInvestment.\nThis paper represents a preliminary attempt to estimate various categories\nof personal savings and investment from the available statistics of transactions\nin financial assets.\nThe author explains carefully the meaning of the term 'personal sector'\nin the national accounts and the various categories of savings which make\nup the total of personal savings. The value of the assets acquired by personal\nsavings is classified in several broad categories for which fairly reliable data\nare available. There is, however, a residue of unidentifiable assets the value\nof which in some years was relatively very large. The author discusses the\ntypes of assets which have not been identified, namely, securities, consumer\ncredit, certain financial liabilities of unincorporated businesses,\ncurrency and loans from assurance companies, and an attempt is made to\nestimate the significance of each in relation to the total value of these assets.\nOxford Economic Papers, (New Series) Vol. 7, No. 1, February 1955\nFROST, R. Some Implications of the Growth of Investment by Institutions,\n1938-53·\nKeynes's views, as expressed in the ' General Theory', on the behaviour of\ninvestors with regard to liquidity and to the valuation of shares and business\nassets, are examined in the light of the growth of institutional investment\nsince the war. The article considers :\n(1) the statistical evidence and the reasons for the increase in the amount\nof private savings represented by retained company profits, and by the\nincrease in the invested funds of life assurance companies, pension funds\nand building societies ;\n(2) the role of liquidity preference in the investment behaviour of these\ninstitutions ;\n(3) the influence of their behaviour on the valuation of shares and business\nassets.\nROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY\nJournal, Series A (General), Vol. 118, Part 1, 1955\nBENJAMIN, B.

The main\nsubjects treated in this symposium are: quality of demographic data;\nfertility trends ; mortality trends ; international migration ; population projection;\ngenetic influences.\nMASON, J. I. AND SACHS, D. Statistics Bearing on Financial Investment.\nThe article summarizes the available material under the following four\nheadings :\n(1) General Indicators of Stock Exchange Investment Activity;\n(2) Financial Analyses of an Industrial Character ;\n(3) Statistics of Individual Concerns or Special Groups ;\n(4) Broad Economic Data concerning Companies, Investment Holdings,\nPersonal Savings, etc.\nThere is a fifth section which discusses gaps in the statistics and projected\nresearch, and finally there is a useful bibliography.\nOPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY\nOperational Research Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 4, December 1954\nTAYLOR, J. AND JACKSON, R. R. P. Application of Birth and Death Process to\nProvision of Spare Machines.\nThe paper is concerned with some of the problems connected with the\noperation of a fleet (or ' population ') of machines, e.g. aircraft. Suppose\nthat the active population consists of N machines and in addition there are\nn spare machines. Suppose further that the rate of becoming unserviceable\nis a random variable with mean f per unit time, that the servicing time\nis a random variable with mean k time units, and that the number of\nmachines that can be serviced concurrently is r. Then the first problem is\nto obtain an expression for Pi , the probability of having i unserviceable\nmachines when a steady state is reached, where i = 0, 1, ..., n+1 and\nis a function of r, k and f. If n +1 machines become unserviceable\nat the same time it will not be possible to operate Ν machines,\nand hence the measure E= 100 (1 — P n + 1 ) % is termed the operational\nefficiency. For any given f, E will depend on k and r, and in any particular\ncase the effects of varying k and r on such quantities as costs, average\nnumber of machines unserviceable, average number of machines being\nserviced, average number of machines waiting for service must be examined\nin order to decide the ' best ' arrangement.\nECONOMETRIC SOCIETY\nEconometrica, Vol. 23, No. 1, January 1955\nWAUGH, F. V. AND BURROWS, G. L. A Short Cut to Linear Programming.\nThe problem involved in linear programming is stated, an example is given\nand the solution is obtained by a simple graphic method.\n", "Articles and Papers of Actuarial Interest 313\nLLOYDS BANK LIMITED\nReview. April 1955\nDACEY, W. MANNING. The Effectiveness of Bank Rate.\nThe article discusses first the effects of the so-called new monetary policy.\nThe author explains why the trend of bank deposits has been upwards\nsince 1952.\nNext he considers the relation between the supply of money and the\ntotal of money incomes. The ratio of the latter to the former is called the\nincome velocity of money, and it is shown that for many countries the ratio\nin 1953 was much the same as it was in 1938, indicating a remarkable\nstability under normal economic conditions. Between these two years the\nratio fell to an abnormally low level.\nThe author next discusses the Gibson Paradox—the high positive correlation\nthat existed between the level of interest rates and the level of\nwholesale prices prior to the 1930's. Since 1932 the correlation has not\nbeen so high, and it is suggested that, since in a free economy a period of\nrising prices will also be a period of rising income velocities, it would be\nbetter to relate the latter to gilt-edged yields. The author compares\nthe trend of the price of Consols with the trend of the inverse of income\nvelocity and between 1947 and 1952 the two curves have moved in close\nharmony. Since 1952 there has been a marked divergence, the recovery in\nthe price of Consols being accompanied by an increase in the rate of turnover\nof the stock of money. Reasons are given why income velocity alone\ncannot give a complete explanation of the behaviour of gilt-edged security\nprices.\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE ASSOCIATION\nPhilosophy of Science, Vol. 22, No. 2, April 1955\nBAR-HILLEL, Y. An Examination of Information Theory.\nSir Ronald Fisher introduced the concept 'amount of information' into\nstatistical theory. It had a very special meaning concerned with a relation between\na sample and the estimator used for estimating the value of a parameter.\nThe author of this paper is mainly concerned with the confusion that has\narisen over the meaning or interpretation of this concept in the application\nof probability theory to various special sciences, particularly communication\nengineering. In this latter case sequences of signal transmissions are\ndecoded into messages giving information, in the everyday meaning of this\nword, to the receiver. The engineer, however, uses the concept ' amount of\ninformation' in a special statistical sense, namely, a specified function of\nthe relative frequency of a certain sequence of signals among the set of all\npossible signal sequences of the same length. Writers have confused matters\nby identifying ' amount of information ' with ' amount of meaning '.\nThe author points out that the ' Statistical Theory of Signal Transmission '\nand the 'Theory of Semantical Content' (i.e. a Theory of Meaning) can\nbe regarded as different interpretations of the same formal system, a system\nwhich may be termed the Calculus of Information. The interpretation of\nthe symbols of this calculus, and hence the meaning of the function for the\n' amount of information ' differ according to the subject-matter of the special\nscience in which the application is being made.\n", "Articles and Papers of Actuarial Interest\nTHE OXFORD INSTITUTE OF STATISTICS\nBulletin, Vol. 17, February 1955\nAuthors—several. Growth and the Balance of Payments. A Symposium.\nAn article Retrospect and Prospect, The Economic Survey 1954 by P. D.\nHenderson was published in the Bulletin for May and June 1954. In that\narticle the author stated his views on some of the more important longerterm\nproblems facing the British economy. His main contention was that\nthe prime object of policy should be to promote a high rate of economic\ngrowth and at the same time find means of keeping the country solvent.\nThe editors of the Bulletin invited several well-known economists to submit\ntheir comments on Mr Henderson's views, and these comments, together\nwith a reply by Mr Henderson, are printed in this symposium.\nDOMINION BUREAU OF STATISTICS, CANADA\nCanadian Sickness Survey 1950-51. Nos. 1-4, Family Expenditure for Health\nServices. No. 5, Volume of Sickness—National Estimates. No. 6, Permanent\nPhysical Disabilities—National Estimates. No. 7, Incidence and Prevalence\nof Illness—National Estimates.\nThe object of the Canadian Sickness Survey was to obtain estimates of the\nincidence and prevalence of illness and accidents of all kinds ; the amount of\nmedical, nursing and other health care received; the volume of family\nexpenditures for the various types of health services; and the prevalence\nof permanent physical disabilities. The bulletins form a series intended to\nprovide a means of releasing interim information on the more important of\nthe results, pending the preparation of a comprehensive publication containing\nmore detailed information together with a fuller description of the\nmethods used.\nThe survey method consisted of personal visits by trained lay enumerators—to\na sample of approximately 10,000 households distributed\nthroughout the ten provinces in metropolitan, small urban, and rural areas.\nAll information, including particulars of income, housing and environment,\nwas obtained by direct interview of a household informant, usually\nthe housewife.\nThe bulletins discuss the definitions (of ' illness ' etc.) employed and give\ndistributions by sex and age of the amount and cost of illness.\n314\n"]</pre>
