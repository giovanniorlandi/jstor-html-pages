Then with a rush they came,\nscrambling over the rough stones, but\nhere the causeway was so narrow that\nwhile their strength lasted two men\nwere as good as twenty, nor, because ol\nthe ti.ud and water, could they be got\nnt from either side. So after all it was\nbut two to two. and the brethren WCR\nthe better two. Their long swords\nflashed nnd smote, and when Wulf\'s\nwas lifted again it shore red. aud a\nman fell with a heavy splash into the\nwaters of. the creek and wallowed\nthere till he died. Godwin\'s foe was\ndown aiso and. as it seemed, sped.\nThen at a muttered word, not waiting\nto be attacked by others, the brethren\nsprang forward. The huddled mob ir.\nfront of them saw them come and\nshrank back, but before they had gone\na yard tbe swords were at work be\nhind. They swore strange oaths; the>\neatight their feet among the rocks aud\nrolled open their faces. In their con\nfusion three of them were pushed intr\nthe water, where two sank in the mud\nand were drowned, the third only drag\ngin}: himself ashore, while the rest\nmade good their escape from the cause\nway. But two had heeu cut down and\nthree had fallen, for whom there was\nno escape. They strove to rise and\nfight, but the linen masks Sapped about\ntheir eyes so that their blows went\nwide, while the long swords of the\nbrothers smote and smote again upon\ntheir helms and harness as the ham\nmers of smiths smite upon an anvil\nuntil they rolled over silent and stir\nloss.\n"Back." sa.id Godwin, "for here the\nroad is wide and they will gel behind\nus."\nSo back they moved slowly, with\ntheir faces to the foe. stopping lost in\nfront of the first man whom Godwin\nhad seemed to kill and who lay face\nUpward with arms outstretched.\n"So far we have done well." said\nWulf. with a short laugh.

"It\nmatters little if Rosamond is spared\nby the waters, for they will scarcely\ntake her now."\nAs he spoke Wulf beard a sound be\nhind him, and of a sudden Godwin\nthrew up his arms and sank to his\nknees.
