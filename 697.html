        <pre>['Wenatchee\'s Big Bed Apple Daily\nVOL. V. NO. 219.\nTIME LIMIT NOT CHANGED\nCity Council Refused Application of the Wenatchee\nValley Railway & Power Company for an\nExtension of Time on the Franchise\nFrom Thirty to Fifty Years\nASKS ABOUT NEW\nTOWN SITE\nNEBRASKA REAL ESTATE MAN\nHAS WRITTEN TO A. A. BOUS\nQUET REGARDING TOWNSITE\nAT COLUMBIA RrVER.\nA. A. Bousquet was in receipt this\nmorning of a letter from Chadron,\nNeb. It is an inquiry regarding the\npurported new town of Columbia\nRiver. Some time last fall the Daily\nWorld had several exposes of this\nnew promotion. There is absolutely\nno prospects of a town at this place\nand the promoters have been doing\na considerable business among the\ngullible. The letter is as follows:\n"Brother Real Estate Dealer:\n"You will pardon my intrusion\nupon your time, but I am seeking a\nlittle information regarding the new\ntown of \'Columbia River,\' the junc\ntion of the Great Northern and Wash\nington-Northern Railways, 18 miles\nsouth of Wenatchee, on the opposite\nside of the river—the townsite own\ned by the North Coast Land company\nof Seattle and Bellingham. We are\noffered lots in this town at $15 and\n$25, according to the plat of the\ntown. The lots are 25x100 feet,\neight blocks from the water front, as\nthe town is reported to be 7 or 8\nblocks from the river front.\n"What can you tell me about this\nnew town? Would you consider lots\nat the prices good buys, or is the\ntown one of the ordinary lot sale\nprojects? I handle some of this\nkind of stuff once in a while but se\nlect my victims, never attempting to\nsell to my friends.\n"Now, I want to know, and I am\ntaking it for granted that you are\nwise, being close enough to know\njust what this Is, and I am asking\nthe information confidentially and\nwill not quote you or your name in\nany manner, only want to know just\nwhat the scheme is, legitimate or the\nordinary new deal.\n"Thanking you in advance for the\nInformation and holding myself In\nreadiness to reciprocate the cour\ntesy."\nSecretary Coburn, of the Wenat\nchee Commercial club, wired the\nBoise, Idaho, Commercial club, where\nthe agent of this exploiting company\nhas been operating, warning the peo\nple of that section to have nothing\nto do with it.\nBig Surprise at the Ball Park.\nThe greatest surprise of the sea\nson was in evidence yesterday at the\nball park. A reporter of the Daily\nWorld caught Jack Lillis and L\nFinch at work with hoes leveling off\nthe ground. These men were hard\nat it about 5 o\'clock last night and\nstate that they intend to go over the\nentire grounds with the hoes. In\nasmuch as these men have a well\ndeserved reputation for non-work it\nwill doubtless require an affidavit\nk from the Daily World reporter in or\nder to make friends of these men\nto believe the story.\nPoindexter Urges Bond Issue\nSPEAKS BEFORE COMMITTEE\nFOR $30,000,000 CERTIFICATES\nOF INDEBTEDNESS—IMPROVE\nMENT AT PORT ADVOCATED.\nWashington, March 30.—Repre\nsentative Poindexter today appeared\nhefore the ways and means commit\ntee in behalf of the bill providing\nfor $30,000,000 worth of certificates\nof indebtedness to be issued against\nthe reclamation fund. Mr. Poindex\nter related that four reclamation pro\njects in Washington need money to\ncomplete them, the settlers are wait\ning for water, and it is impossible\nfor them to obtain it under the ordi\nnary course of events for a long\ntime. He answered questions of\ncommitteemen, and says he feels\nconfident that the bill is stronger\nthan when it was first introduced.\nFor Fort George Wright.\nMr. Poindexter also had a hearing\nbefore the house committee on ap\nThe franchise for the Wenatchee\nValley Railway & Power company\nwas not passed last night by the city\ncouncil to the third reading. This\nwas not done, however, without con\nsiderable oratory on the part of the\npromoters of the railway. Attorney\nL. J. Nelson of Leavenworth, having\nthe matter in charge, was present\nand stated that since the last meet\ning of the council he had taken the\nmatter up with the men who are\nbacking the enterprise and they con\nsider that the 30-year franchise is\ntoo short a time and that if he could\nnot secure the extension of the fran\nchise that he would have to ask to\nhave it laid over for a time at least.\nJ. W. Quigg addressed the council\non the extension of the time. Hg\nstated that he had become associated\nin the company and would interest\nsome of his northern friends in the\nenterprise providing a long-time\nfranchise w r as given. Mr. Quigg\nstated that he would start work in\nSeptember on building the bridges\nbetween Wenatchee and Leaven\nworth. This would entail an ex\npenditure of approximately $60,000.\nHe recited in detail some of the bene\nfits that would accrue to Wenatchee\nfrom the building of the road. He\nestimated the cost of construction\nand rolling stock, depots, etc., at\nabout $2,000,000, and stated that\ncapitalists looking for franchises of\nthis sort would not care to go into\na short-time proposition. He stated\nthat for the first ten years, anyway,\nthere would be no money in operat\ning an electric line in this valley.\nProbably there would be a lossage\nand should tae valley then go ahead\nas was promised there would be more\nmoney in the operation after ten\nyears and should it not go ahead\nthere would be no big money in it.\nConsequently he felt that the city\ncouncil should make a special in\nducement to interest capitalists in\nthis enterprise and should be willing\nto grant at least a 50-year franchise.\nAsks Financial Showing.\nThere seemed to be a disposition\non the part of the city council last\nnight to make the extension to 40\nor 50 years, providing the members\nhad assurance that there was money\nin sight by the promoters to build\nthe line. In fact, Mr. Nelson was\ntold that if his company could make\na showing to the council that it had\nthe funds to build the road that the\nextension would be granted. The\ncompany, however, does not care to\nmake a public showing of its as\nsets. The officers, however, are posi\ntive in the assertion that they see\ntheir way clear to start in at once\non the enterprise.\nMr. Nelson made a good point be\nfore the council last night, however,\nin stating that the city was*Svell pro\ntected in granting the franchise as\nthe company desired, from the fact\nthat the franchise calls for a cash\ndeposit of $2,000 and a surety bond\nof $3,000 and this is forfeited to\nthe city in case the terms of the fran\nchise are not complied with.\nMr. Quigg also made the positive\nstatement that he and his northern\nassociates will commence work this\nfall on the bridges for the line,\nwhich will cost in the neighborhood\nof $60,000, and evidently the pro-\n(Continued on Page 4)\npropriations in favor of an amend\nment to the sundry civil appropria\ntion bill appropriating $196,000 for\nthe construction of barracks and\nquarters at Fort George Wright, Spo\nkane. Mr. Poindexter says the war\ndepartment has refused to recom\nmend any such appropriations this\nyear, owing to the policy of economy\nof the Taft administration.\nState Boundary.\nSenator Jones today had passed\nthrough the senate his joint resolu\ntions authorizing the states of Wash\nington and Oregon to adjust their\ndifferences over their boundary line\nbetween themselves. The resolution\nwas indorsed by the governors of\nboth states.\nStorm Reached Nebraska.\nNorfolk, Neb., March 30.—The\nRocky mountain tstorm swept over\ninto Nebraska today, prostrating all\nwires and tieing up traffic. Four\ninches of snow fell and it is drifting\nbadly.\nWENATCHEE, WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 1910.\nCONGESTION ON\nRAILROADS\nChicago, March 30.—James J. Hill\npredicted that the railroads of the\nUnited States will experience next\nfall the greatest traffic congestion\nin their history. He also is of the\nopinion that there is no way to pre\nvent this state of affairs, and that\nshippers who dispatch goods during\nthe congested period do so at their\nown risk.\n"The tonnage offered the roads is\nincreasing daily," Hill said, "and all\nindications are that before fall we\nwill not be able to supply sufficient\ntraffic units to care for it. Tonnage\noffered for shipment is growing at a\nmuch more rapid rate than are the\nfacilities to handle it, and it does\nnot take a mathematician to figure\nwhere these conditions will lead to.\n"The roads are not to blame for\nthis. It is next to impossible for\nthem to raise money enough to make\nextensions as rapidly as they are\nneeded. There appears to be diffi\nculty ahead for the shipper and the\ncarrier this year."\nSwift Punishment for Crime.\nJames R. Hamill, the Leavenworth\nman who was brought to the city\nlast night after receiving preliminary\nexamination at Leavenworth, wan\narraigned in the superior court this\nmorning. Hamill plead guilty and\nwas given a penitentiary sentence of\nfrom one to five years. Hamill was\ndrunk Saturday night and, with a\ncompanion, engaged in a drunken\nsquabble in which his companion was\nbadly knifed.\n****************\n* BASEBALL OFFICE HOURS +\n+ Baseball office hours are from ♦\n+ 9 a. m. to 11:30 a. m. and from +\n+ 2 p. m. to about 5 p. m. +\n♦ These hours have been chosen +\n+ as they do not interfere with +\n+ school and office hours.

AMOS LOST HIS LIFE AT\nMIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT IN A\nDERAILMENT THIS SIDE OF\nTHE TUNNEL.\nDr. Saunders was notified this\nmorning that J. E. Amos, a Great\nNorthern brakeman, was killed at\nmidnight last night by a derailment\ntwo miles this side of the Cascade\ntunnel. In view of the fact that the\nkilling was purely accidental he con\nsequently did not deem it necessary\nto hold an inquest. The tie up as\na result of the derailment delayed\npassenger train No. 44 until 9:30\nthis morning.\nAmos was an old employe of the\nrailway company and his body will\nbe shipped to relatives In Texas.

C, to establish a\nlock canal on land at the rapids-\nThe plans of the Strahorn inter\nests call for the construction of a\nlarge canal eight miles long, primar\nily used as a conveyor of water to\nbe utilized in a gigantic electric\nplant to furnish power for thousands\nof acres of arid land on the east\nside of the river. The diversion ca\nnal will be the largest in the Pacific\nnorthwest, and will carry water to\nnearly 500,000 acres of irrigable\nfruit land.\nThe construction of the canal is\nnecessary for the development of the\nelectric power, but it offers such a\nsimple solution of the navigation\nproblem confronting boats on the\nriver that the Strahorn interests, act\ning on the request of steamboat own\ners and residents along the Colum\nbia, have presented a proposition to\nthe government, offering to open the\ncanal to navigation under certain\nconditions.\nThe Priest rapids section of the\nColumbia is the one insurmountable\nstretch which can not be negotiated\nby steamers except in high water,\nand then only by the most powerful\ncraft, with the aid of lines to shore.\nThe Irrigation canal will permit navi\ngation at all seasons, and the fed\neral government will be relieved of\nthe necessity of constructing its own\nlocks.\nW. H. Usher and family will leave\nFriday for the Okanogan country,\nwhere Mr. Usher has 160 acres of\nland under water and ready for im\nprovement.\nGeorge D. Brown returned yester\nday from a several weeks eastern\ntrip. This was made in company\nwith C. P. Bissett and for the pur\npose of floating the bonds of the\nBrown Electric company in the big\nelectric plant to be constructed at\nthe mouth of the Entiat. Mr. Bis\nsett was detained several weeks in\nMinneapolis. Mr. Brown reports\nthat his trip was successful and that\nengineers of the bonding company\nwill be here in the course of a week\nor ten days to examine possibilities\nof the plant. Should their report be\nfavorable, as is anticipated, the con\nstruction work will be rushed dur\ning the summer.\nMr. Brown\'s engineers report that\nfully 5,000 horsepower of electrical\nenergy can be developed at the mouth\nof the Entiat and he figures on the\nexpenditure of half a million dollars\nin the development of power at that\nplace. In the enterprises which he\nhas in view, most of them pumping.\nMr. Brown believes that the full ca\npacity of the plant will be taxed in\nthe coming two years.\nMr. Brown risked a number of the\nbig financial centers of the east and\nfound a very conservative feeling.\nMoneyed men have a tendency to\nhold on to their money. The in\nvestigations that have been started,\nthe corporation dissolution suits, the\nrailroad corporation bills proposed\nand the general tendency of legis\nlation has had the effect of playing\nhavoc with the investing public and\nthere is a feeling of uncertainty as\nto market conditions. There seems\nto be plenty of money, yet Mr. Brown\nsays that people are not investing as\nfreely as in the past.\nCITY WILL SPEND $193,200\nCity Council Agrees on Improvement Plans for Big\nDisftridt North and Wesft of Orondo—Esti\nmated Cost $5.63 a Front Foot Under\n5 or 10 Year Bonding System\nmam\ntrait\nWhile the executive committee\nhaving in charge the movement for\nthe securing a Y.

This is\nto last but six days and it is expected\nthat within this time the full $35,-\n--000 necessary for the building will\nbe subscribed. Within the coming\nfew days it is expected that the ex\necutive committee will appoint ten\ncaptains having in charge a territory\nwhich will be canvassed for sub\nscriptions. No field is to be dupli\ncated and it is expected that every\nman in the valley will be seen by\nsome members of the committee.\nSecretary Wilcox is still here and\nwill remain during the progress of\nthe campaign to assist in the work.\nThe executive committee consists of\nArthur Gunn, chairman; L. V. Wells,\nW. A. Thompson, Dr. Schiltz and Dr.\nStevenson, and these men are un\ndertaking the work with the idea of\nmaking a success of the movement.\nBesides the captains of the squads\nwho will canvass the business dis\ntricts and the growers there will also\nbe squads under the captaincy of the\nyoung men who will work especially\nwith the younger men.\nThe campaign for subscriptions\nhas not formally been opened, but\nthe $7,000 already pledged has come\nas a voluntary subscription by men\nwho are interested in the work. The\ndate on which the subscription can\nvass will commence will be an\nnounced in a few days.

Mr. Ward submit\nted estimates on tour forms of im\nprovement. The first embodies a\nconcrete curb with local rock mac\nadam and at a total estimated cost\nof $170,633.12, or approximately\n$4,97 per front foot.\nThe second estimate was on con\ncrete curb with basalt rock mac\nadam at an estimated cost of $178,-\n--253, or approximately $5.19 per\nfront foot.\nThe third estimate was on a com\nbined curb and gutter with local rock\nmacadam at an estimated expense of\n$185,584 or approximately $5.41 per\nfront foot.\nThe fourth estimate, and which the\ncity council instructed the engineer\nto prepare a resolution calling for\nthe proposed improvement, was on\ncombined concrete curb and gutter,\nbasalt rock macadam at an estimat\ned cost of $193,203.92, or an ap\nproximate cost of $5.63 per front\nfoot.\nThis improvement embodies the\nlatest in macadam. This is in three\ncourses of six inches. Each course is\nof different size and the top layer is\nfine screening, and each course is\nthoroughly rolled and the top layer\nis intended as a binder. This is the\nlatest macadam, and it was the sense\nof the council last night that in this\nimprovement district nothing but the\nbest should be used. Further, the\nstreet crossings and alley crossings\nare all of concrete. The streets are\n25, 30 and 40 feet, with a 6 foot\nconcrete sidewalk, with a 7 foot\nparking strip on each side of walk\nfor a 30 foot roadway.\nThe improvement district contem\nplated includes the following streets:\nThird street south from Miller to\nKing.\nSecond street south from King to\nOrondo.\nFirst street south from E to Or\nondo.\nPalouse street south from city lim\nits to King.\nFirst street north from city lim\nits to A and Chelan to Columbia.\nSecond street north from D street\nto Columbia.\nPoplar avenue from D street to\nChelan.\nF street from Fourth street soutb\nto First street south.\nE street from Third street to First\nstreet north.\nD street from Third street south to\nPoplar.\nC street from King street to Sec\nond street north.\nB street from King street to Sec\nond street north.\nPennsylvania avenue from Second\nstreet north to Poplar.\nChelan avenue from- Second street\nnorth to north line of Whitman.\nMission street from First street\nnorth to Second street north.\nInvitation to Eagles.\nR.

CRIM OF ELLENSBURG\nIS TOO STRENUOUS IN HIS\nMETHODS FOR A SCORE IN\nCONGREGATION.\nEllensburg, Wash., March 30.—\nBecause Pastor A. L. Crim asked the\nmen of his congregation to whistle\nthe chorus in church yesterday morn\ning while the women sang the words,\n20 people got up and left the edifice.\nAmong these were seven men and the\nrest were women, who characterized\nthe whistling as "going too far."\nPastor Crim led the whistlers him\nself, and his supporters state that he\ncan whistle like a professional. He\nalso had the chorus of the hymns\nwhistled at Sunday school and the\ninnovation worked successfully.\nRev. A. L. Crim is a former evan\ngelist and his methods are strenuous.\nHe has more than doubled the mem\nbership of his congregation and the\nattendance at Sunday school in the\nsix months he has been here. Besides,\nhe united a church which was for\nmerly divided by strife. This is the\nfirst revolt against his methods. He\ncame here from the Ballard Chris\ntian church, Seattle, and has con\nducted evangelist meetings all over\nWashington and Oregon.\nArkansas State Primary.\nLittle Rock, Ark., March 30. —The\ndemocratic campaign in Arkansas\nclosed last night in a lively finish\nand today the primaries are being\nheld throughout the state.

He is not a hot-air\nartist, but a shrewd business man\nwho is accustomed to weigh careful\nly any proposition to which his at\ntention is directed. In speaking of\nthe centralization of industry he\nsays:\n"The day of combinations has come\nand their regulation is the only solu\ntion of the problem. The best step\never proposed in this direction is the\nfederal incorporation tax which is a\ntrue step toward solving the evils of\ncombination. Wealth is not being\ntaxed enough in this country."\nMr. Carnegie also said before the\ncongressional tariff committee, prior\nto the passage of the Aldrich-Payne\ntariff bill, that the duty on steel was\ntoo high as well as the duty on many\nother trust controlled products.\nThere was a tendency at the time to\ncriticize his position because he him\nself had become wealthy by taking\nadvantage of conditions which had\ncome into existence in the decades\nsince the civil war. The reasoning\nof his critics was evidently based on\nthe the assumption that if he had be\ncome a multimillionaire by taking\nadvantage of existing conditions, a\nsimilar chance should be given to\neveryone else to do so. But the po\nsition is not well taken. It is the\nbusiness of honest and intelligent\nmen to deal with present day condi\ntions in the light and experience of\nthe past and if evils have arisen\nwhich need correction, it is the part\nof wisdom to deal with existing evils\nin a manner which will correct them.\nAt the present time there are bills\npending in congress which have ex\necutive endorsement and which are\nthe outgrowth of careful study of\npresent day conditions. They are in\ntended to correct tendencies in our\nindustrial organization which\nthoughtful men feel to be inimical to\nthe general welfare, but congress\nhesitates to enact them into law. The\npresident has been forced to threaten\nthe use of the "big stick" in order to\nget congressional action on them.\nHere are the measures which the\npresident wants: I\nThe passage of the court of com\nmerce bill.\nThe passage of the postal savings\nbank law. j\nThe passage of the conservation\nlegislation.\nThe enactment of the anti-Injunc\ntion legislation.\nIn view of the comments of Mr.\nCarnegie and the recommendations\nof President Taft, it is not strange\nto thinking men that there should\nnot be absolute harmony in the ranks\nof either the democratic or the re\npublican parties. It is not strange\neither that the talk of reading the\nprogressive republicans, or the so\ncalled "insurgents," out of the repub\nlican party has ceased. There is a\nreason.\n— o—\nVictor Murdock of Kansas, repre\nsentative in congress, deserves our\nthanks. He has defined what an in\nsurgent is by saying that insurgency\n"Is an effort to write upon public\nopinion a definition of the moral right\nand wrong in present conditions."\nWhat "Uncle Joe" Cannon says about\ninsurgents is unfit for publication.\nNo one denies that the cost, of liv\ning is high. The president admits it\nbut he says It is not high enough to\ncause suffering. He does not admit\nthat the Payne-Aldrich tariff laws\ncaused the increase Whatever the\ncause the people wish relief, and that\nsoon.\nJ. J. Browne, Pres. Guy C. Browne, Vice Pre*\nU.

The\ncouncil Instructed the clerk to draft\nthe desired resolution for the state\nmeeting.\nWant 7 Foot Parking Strip.\nW. R. Prowell, on behalf of a large\nnumber of the residents of D street,\nappeared before the council and\nasked that no change be made in the\nplans for the improvement of D\nstreet. The original plans call for\nsix foot sidewalk with a 7 foot park\ning strip on each side of the walk\nand a 30 foot roadway. There has\nbeen an effort made to change this\nplan, and Mr. Prowell had the sig\nnatures of property owners control\ning about 1,300 feet of frontage. The\ncouncil, after hearing arguments in\nthe matter, decided that this plan\nwould make a better street, and went\non record as against any change.\nThe engineer was also instructed\nby the council not to grant any per\nmits for terraces or steps on the\nparking strips. Such must be made\non the property line and not on the\ncity parking strip.\nMust Spray Trees in the City.\nThe council was in receipt of a\ncommunication from Inspector Dar\nlington calling attention to the fact\nthat all trees within the corporate\nlimits must be sprayed and that in\nthe past the trees in the city had\nbeen a menace to the outside grow\ners. The parking committee was in\nstructed to confer with the district\ninspector and make the necessary ar\nrangements for spraying in the city.\nSteel Pipe High.\nThere was but one bid received\nfor the steel pipe for Mission street.\nThe bid was for 1,050 feet of ten\ninch pipe; 2,625 feet of eight-inch\npipe; 300 feet of six-inch pipe with\nthe babbit metal and other fixtures\nthat go with this pipe, and was ap\nproximately $7,000. This is for the\nMission street line and the bid was\ntemporarily laid on the table.\nThe new fire ordinance and the\nnew building ordinance were both\npassed to the third reading.\nSubsewer Rolls Ready.\nThe assessment rolls for the three\nnew subsewer districts were\npresented by Engineer Ward. The\ncouncil will set a date for hearing\nprotests on these. The council will\nthen pass an ordinance approving\nthem and then they will go to the\ncity treasurer for payment. Sub\nsewer No. 4, on Thurston street, will\ncost $63.81 per each 25 foot lot;\nNo. 6, in the alley from Mission to\nWenatchee between Orondo and Pa\nlouse, will cost $55.27 for each 25\nfoot lot; No. 7, the Columbia street\nsewer, will cost $52.21.\nThe matter of securing fire appar\natus came up fer discussion last\nnight, but the matter was passed over\ntemporarily from the fact that there\ndoes not seem to be funds in sight\nto select the auto-propelled appar\natus which the department believes\nis necessary. The fire committee re\ncommends that the old fire bell bo\ninstalled in the fire house on the hill\nbut passed up the matter of having\nit equipped with the electric alarm.\nThe fire committee also having 1n\ncharge the moving of the red apple\nelectric sign reported that bids would\nbe received for the moving of this\nduring the coming week.\nThe parking committee reported\nthat this committee has spent some\ntime on the Orondo avenue parking\nBite and found that it would take a\ngreat deal of work to get this in\nshape to plant the trees and recom\nmended that the park be worked dur\ning the coming summer but that the\ntrees should not be planted until\nfall. The trees for Chelan avenue\nwill be here in a short time and the\npark committee was asked instruc\ntions what to do with them. It is\nlikely that the matter of planting the\ntrees will be up to the city and that\nthe expense will come out of the\ngeneral fund during this season.\nWhen the next levy is made it is\nlikely that a levy will be made for\npark purposes and that the city will\nassume all care of the trees in the\nparking strips.\nThe democratic congressional com\nmittee has about decided to establish\nits headquarters in Chicago during\nthe coming campaign.\nTIME LIMIT NOT\nCHANGED\n(Continued from Page 1.)\nmoters have shown Mr. Quigg that\nfunds are in sight or he would not\nbe willing to put in this amount for\nstock in the company.\nCouncilman Begg made the sug\ngestion that inasmuch as the mem\nbers of the council were inexperi\nenced in franchise matters that if\nthe railway company was willing to\nallow the council to select and pay\nfor expert opinion on the matter\nand If it was considered advisable to\ngrant a 50-year franchise under the\nterms provided that such advice\ncouid be secured before the next\nmeeting of the council and this mat\nter could be threshed out at that\ntime.\nThe franchise was read by title\nand passed to the third reading.\nMr. Nelson stated that there is a\npossibility -that he would not care\nto call the matter up at the next\nmeeting of the council, as he would\nhave to take the matter up with the\nbackers of the road and ascertain\npositively whether or not they care\nto entertain a 30-year franchise.\nRoosevelt Off for Naples.\nAlexandria, Egypt, March 30. —\nColonel Roosevelt, Mrs. Roosevelt,\nKermit and Miss Ethel sailed for\nNaples this afternoon on the steamer\nPrinz Heinrich.\nCairo, Egypt, March 30. —The\nRoosevelts were given a hearty send\noff when they left here by train for\nAlexandria this morning.

The river is now rising rap\nidly and the steamer will be tied up\nuntil low water next fall. With the\ncompletion of the work at Spokane\nrapids all the work planned by the\nstate commission has been finished.\nThe next work will be to extend the\noperations to diminish the difficulties\nof navigation at points during high\nwater.\nThe low water period is of the\nlongest duration, and the operation\nof steamers at that time is of the\ngreater importance to people along\nthe river, as it is in the low water\nstage that principal products must\nbe marketed.\nSpokane Rapids Cleared.\nSpokane rapids, at the mouth of\nthe Spokane river, 65 miles south\nof Kettle Falls, has been among the\n\' most formidable obstructions be\n! tween the mouth of the Okanogan\n| and Kettle Falls. A few years ago\n! private parties proposed undertak\ning the work and permission was ob\ntained from the government. Spo\nkane capitalists were interested, but\nthe project was abandoned.\nWhen the Yakima arrived at the\nrapids March 1, Captain McDermott\n\\ decided to bring the boat over if\nJ possible to reach points above, which\nj could be best worked at low water,\n! and to return to the rapids later.\n| The Yakima is the largest boat on\nj the upper Columbia, but the pass\n| age over the rapids in extreme low\n! water was accomplished without mis\nhap.\nThe work done by the steamer at\nthe rapids consisted of blowing out\nlarge boulders that congested the\nchannel for several hundred feet.\nAbout 60 large blasts were fired.\nFarmers as far as the Davenport and\nWilbur districts heard the explosions\nand drove to the river to see the\nsteamer. With the obstructions re\nmoved the fall of the current has\nbeen graduated and the passage of\nthe rapids made safer and easier.\nMay Run Barges on River.\nEngineer Ryan of the steamer\nsays: "The Columbia river, which,\nuntil last winter, has been considered\nthe most dangerous of all swift\nrivers, is now a barge river at medi\num and low stages from Rickey rap\nids to Wenatchee. Captain McDer\nmott has achieved marvelous results.\nIt was necessary to take the Yakima\ninto many of the worst places and\n| out again to place shots and get\nj away from them, but all of this was\ni done without harm to the steamer,\n: whereas, other smaller boats have\n; been nearly torn to pieces attempt\ning the ascent between Foster creek\nand the Spokane river.\n| "The river is all \'good\' now, from\n1 dead low water until perhaps six\ni weeks of extreme high water, when\n! Box canyon and Hellgate will be bad.\n! but these can be remedied, while\n! there are, of course, some places\nwhere lines will have to be\nused by the steamers in ascending.\nI consider no place left in the river\nfrom here to Bridgeport as bad as\nEntiat rapids near Wenatchee, which\nhave been navigated for years."\nNew Telephone at Depot Waiting\nRoom.\nA new telephone has been in\n; stalled at the south end of the wait\n! ing room in the passenger depot of\n| the Great Northern railway. The\n| phone has been placed there for pub\nj lie use, but it is expected that the\ncharges for its use will pay for it.\ni Five cents must be dropped in the\nslot before talking communications\ncan be secured.\nRev. Gist Goes Home.\nRev. Gist, pastor of the Christian\nI church of this city, left yesterday\nfor his former home in Coeur\nd\'Alene. Mr. Gist has been ill for\nseveral days, and fearing that an\n! attack of typhoid fever was coming\nupon him he took train No. 4 yes\nterday for Idaho. He expects to be\ngone at least two weeks. The church\nwill be supplied, possibly by Rev\nGraves, until the regular pastor re\nturns.\nThe Christian party is to hold a\nconference soon in Rock Island, 111.,\nfor the purpose of discussing a\nunited demand for a direct vote of\nthe people, women included, on pro\nhibition and all other leading is\nsues of the day.\nUnder the initiative and referen\ndum law nearly a score of measures\n: will be submitted for the considera\ntion of the electors of Oregon at the\ngeneral election next November.\n] Limited woman suffrage and state-,\n! wide prohibition are among the pro\nj posals to be voted on.\nGRANGE IS EOR IN\nSURGENTS\nERNEST M. SMITH, LECTURER\nOF STATE GRANGE, POINTS,\nOUT THAT PROGRESSIVES\nSTAND FOR FARM INTERESTS.\n"You must not- go into politics. It\nis the rock upon which all farmers\'\norganizations split. It is my purpose\nto discuss this objection," says Er\nnest M. Smith, lecturer of the State\nGrange.\nA few generations ago politics\nmeant very little in a national way.\nIt mattered very little to the average\nman what was being done at Wash\nington. But we are living under a\nnew economic system today. The\ndomain of politics has been extended\nbecause society has become so inex\ntricable complex. Individual activity\nhas practically ceased. It, is the age\nof co-operation and corporation. H©\nwho makes up his mind to "go it\nalone" has but a short road to go.\nPolitics meets us eveiywhere from\nthe cradle to the grave; for politics\nis simply the science of social and\neconomic relationship of man with\nman—of one citizen with all other\ncitizens. If a farmers\' society taboos\npolitics then it must not discuss mar\nkets, or roads, or taxes, or schools,\nor transportation rates, or mail ser\nvice or banks, or practical co-opera\ntion, for all of these questions mean\npolitics. It cannot even discuss apple\npacking because some fellow will lead\nup to a discussion of the Lafean bill\nnow before congress, and it will all\nend in a horrible political wrangle.\nSo they, therefore, will be confined to\nsuch questions as forage crops, silos,\ncover crops, and the balanced ration,\netc.\nPolitics Inevitable.\nAs a matter of fact, this objection\nto any political discussion in the\nGrange comes from those who are\nhopelessly behind the times. We can\nnot be successful farmers unless we\nunderstand the conditions under\nwhich we live and work, and are\nprepared to meet them. Can we as\nfarmers, afford to stay out of poli\ntics? Are the railroads and Standard\nOil and the whisky ring out of poli\ntics? Are other lines of industry\navoiding politics? Can we alone af\nford to pay no attention to those\nquestions? Can we afford to let a\nfew corporation hirelings make our\nlaws, fix our taxes, determine our\nfreight rates, and pass a tariff law\nunder which agricultural machinery,\nmade in the United States, after it\nhas been sent to Europe, shipped\nbtck again, paying the duty can be\nbought cheaper than direct from the\nfactory?\nNor can the country afford to have\nthe farmers neglect the study of pol\nitical questions. The farm vote com\nprises about thirty per cent of the\ntotal of the nation. If that thirty per\ncent, normally the most independent\nof all, be left a prey of selfish poli\nticians through ignorance and preju\ndice, it is surely an inestimable loss\nto the country.\nObjections Prom Corporations.\nThe real source of the objection\nto farmer\'s societies taking an inter\nest in public affairs comes from the\ncorrupt special interests and their\npolitical hirelings; from men to\nwhom roads and schools are nothing\nmore than pawns in their game. They\nknow that it is only the ignorant who\ncan be made believe that the inter\nests of the trusts are the interests of\nthe people.\nYet, in a certain sense, the Grange\nhas nothing to do with "politics"\nwhen "politics" means the scramble\nfor office the Grange takes no part.\nIt has no more sympathy with the\nassociated "outs" than with the con\nsolidated "ins." As an organization\nit does not enter any party conven\ntion. It can endorse no party. It\nneither nominates nor endorses can\ndidates. It does not allow discussion\nof the relative merits of parties in\nits meetings.\nI\nOrder Educational.\nThe reason for this is plain. Our\norder is primarily an educational\none. The Grange enligthens the\nfarmer on issues and measures. It\ncreates and moulds sentiment. It\nunifies on principles, but these must\nalways be a difference of opinion on\nmethods of procedure. Thus we are\nall agreed that the interests of the\nrapacious and lawless exploiters of\ni Wall street are not the interests of\nthe people. They heartily approve\nthe course of the Cannon-Aldrich\nforces. The Grangers as heartily and\nunanimously disapprove. The one\nupholds our present tariff and tax\nlaws. The other denounces them and\ndemands reform. The one finds the\npresent system just right. The other\ndemands change and progress in the\ninterests of the common people. The\none is organized to reach out a rap\nacious hand for further control of\nthe government and the resources of\nthe nation, demands a central bank,\nship subsidy, and opposes the policy\nof conservation of natural resources.\nThe other is organized to resist all\nthese demands and is asking counter\npropositions equally radical. j\nNow, while the Grangers are unit\ned on measures, they are, unfortun\nately divided on methods of proced-\nJUST FINISHED AND READY FOR OCCUPANCY AN\n8-Room Modern House\nin Wenatchee Park Addition\nLOTS NOS. 10 AND 11 ON CASCADE STREET.\nstrictly modern, built from concrete blocks, graded lots, lawn\nwill be made and every modern city conveniences will go with\nthis fine house.

SELLING AGENTS Phone 1432\nure. One says: "There is a large\nand growing element in the republi\ncan party which can serve our pur\nposes. Let us all get in together and\nhelp the progressives to capture the\nmachinery of the dominant party."\nThe progressive democrat says: "All\nsuch attempts are useless and have\nalways failed because the trusts are\nentrenched in the republican party.\nThe people have long controlled the\ndemocratic party and it is the logical\ncnannel for our efforts." Tbe social\nist objects: Bourbonism in demo\ncracy is as great a load for real pro\ngress as reactionary Is in the repub\nlican party. The whole system must\nbe changed. It must be done through\na party in nowise allied to the capi\ntalistic system." And so down the\nline.\nHostile to Standpatters.*\nI hope that I have made it plain\nthat while the Grange is hostile to\nthe course of the standpatters among\nthe republicans, the Bourbon demo\ncrats and the Jacobin socialists, yet\nit does not profess to attempt to se\ncure unity of action among its mem\nbers. It is a maker of public senti\nment. When public opinion is ripe\nit will be comparatively easy for a\nsupplementary organization to take\nup the work of securing united poli\ntical action to obtain the reforms de\nmanded by the public.\nComing Events\nI\nMarch 31—Old Settlers* ball In\nElks\' hall.\nApril 4 —County commissioners\nmeet.\nApril 12—Court convenes.\nApril 14—Arbor Day.\nApril 15—Census Enumeration be\ngins.\nApril 23—First game of Northwest\nleague.\nApril 28 —Tuberculosis Day.\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad com\npany\'s revised rules for emloyes, just\npromulgated, have caused consterna\ntion, because one of them prohibits\nthe use of tobacco in any form on\npassenger trains.\nEagle Transfer\nCompany\nIncorporated.\nCITY DRAY AND TRANSFER\nSpecial Attention to Baggage.\nBoa to All Trains and Boats.\nWENATCHEE, WASH.\nPhone 1101.\nHotel *5\nDel NUNDO\nBT.
