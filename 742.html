The library \nof the Finnish Cadet Corps was extensive; that of the Helsinki Yunker School \nwas more modest. Units had separate libraries for officers and soldiers. The \nformer provided primarily professional literature, the latter recreational reading.\nNone of the military libraries described has survived intact and their \ncollections have been widely dispersed. However, various books from them \nare to be found in Finland, particularly in the National Defence University \nLibrary. Some books were returned to Russia in the 1920s and at least two \nhave found their way to England.\nkeywords Finland, military libraries, Finnish army, Finnish Cadet Corps, \nHelsinki Yunker School \nThis short survey of military libraries in Finland considers the libraries of military \neducational institutions, libraries for officers at unit and higher level, and, to a lesser \nextent, unit libraries for non-commissioned officers and soldiers during what might \nbe called the displaced nineteenth century. The emphasis is on Finnish rather than \nRussian libraries. The historical background of the subject is easily stated. Finland, \nwhich had formed an integral part of the Swedish realm since the Middle Ages, was \nwrenched away from Sweden as the result of the Russo-Swedish War of 1808–1809 \nand incorporated into the Russian Empire as an autonomous grand duchy. The Finns \nwere thus largely responsible for running their own affairs until the end of the nineteenth\ncentury and the beginning of the twentieth century when the Russians began \nto try to integrate Finland into the rest of the Empire. The Finns resisted this russification\nand took advantage of the chaos resulting from the Russian revolutions of \n1917 to declare Finland independent in December 1917. That independence was \nestablished in the first half of 1918 — hence the final date of this article’s title — but \nonly after a war of liberation from the Russians that was also a bitter civil war \n', '140 J E O SCREEN\nbetween the Finnish government and a ‘Red’ Finnish socialist insurrection backed by \nthe Bolsheviks.\nAn important consequence of incorporation in the Russian Empire was that \nFinland’s contribution to its own defence became of secondary importance. The \ndefence of Finland became the task of the imperial Russian army and navy. The \nRussians usually kept an infantry division in Finland as well as troops in the fortresses\nthere, while the Baltic Fleet had an important base at Helsinki (Helsingfors). \nThe military units raised by Finland during the so-called autonomy period (1809–\n1917) were few in number, never amounting to more than a few thousand men, and \nthey were liable to be disbanded when economic conditions were bad (as in 1867–\n1868, or when Russian political pressure required, as over the period 1901–1905). \nThese units were originally composed of enlisted soldiers. This changed as the result \nof the Finnish Military Service Law of 1878, passed by the Finnish Diet, and implemented\nin 1881. A new national army then came into being, composed of conscripts \ntrained by a small cadre of regular officers and non-commissioned officers.1 \nAutonomous Finland undoubtedly had few soldiers, but it nevertheless produced a \ngreat many officers, most of whom served in the imperial Russian forces, possibly in \nexcess of four thousand over the autonomy period as a whole. To a great extent this \nwas due to the existence of two officer-training schools in Finland, the Finnish Cadet \nCorps and the Helsinki Yunker School, of which by far the more important was the \nFinnish Cadet Corps.\nThe Finnish Cadet Corps was founded as the Topographical Corps at Haapaniemi \nin eastern Finland in 1812 — hence the starting date in the title of this article — to \ntrain survey officers for the Russian army.2 The establishment succeeded a military \nschool dating from Swedish times. In 1819 the Corps was moved to Hamina (Fredrikshamn)\nin south-eastern Finland and reopened in 1821 as the Finnish Cadet Corps, \na training school for officers of all arms, initially open only to Finnish upper-class \nboys. It provided for boys and young men a ‘modern’, that is, a non-classical, education,\nand for a long time was second only to the Imperial Alexander University in \nHelsinki in its educational importance. The establishment grew to 120 cadets. The \nCorps had a library, to which there are numerous references in its extensive archive, \nwhich is preserved in Helsinki at the former Military Archives, now part of the \nNational Archives, although still separately housed. The library had to begin almost \nfrom scratch because many books had been destroyed in a fire at the Topographical \nCorps in 1818. Its recreation was greatly helped by a large donation from the Empress \nof Russia of 10,000 paper rubles.\nHow much progress had been achieved during the first twelve years of the Corps \nat Hamina is evident from the important book on military schools in Finland by Frans \nP. von Knorring, who was chaplain and teacher of religion at the Corps from 1817 \nto 1834. Writing in 1832, von Knorring stated that:\nAt the Corps there is a library, which at present comprises 3,500 volumes, of which a \nlarge part are textbooks, of which several were to be found at Haapaniemi [that is, at \nthe former Topographical Corps]. Part of the books were bequeathed to the Corps by \nGeneral Sprengtporten and the majority were bought subsequently.3\nThe reference to the bequest by General Göran Magnus Sprengtporten, who had died \nin 1819, is of interest because he had defected from his native Sweden to Russia in \n', '141FROM HELSINKI TO IRKUTSK\n1786. Books from his first extensive, abandoned, and then confiscated library eventually\nbecame part of the library of the Swedish Military Academy at Karlberg, \nfounded in 1792, while his second library, formed in Russia, helped to support the \nFinnish Cadet Corps.4 \nFor many years it is difficult from the records to distinguish the Corps’s textbooks \nfrom its library proper. The task is not helped by the fact that the grant for the library \nalso covered expenditure on teaching aids such as maps and scientific instruments. \nThe purchase grant provided under the 1831 Regulations for the Corps was approximately\nequal to the salaries of two senior teachers. This sum was 3750 paper rubles \nand a further 400 paper rubles were provided for the librarian, an appointment \nalways held by one of the teachers. The 1850 Regulations provided the same sums of \nmoney, but expressed them in silver rubles — 1071.50 and 114.39 respectively. The \n1863 Regulations showed the sums in the recently-introduced Finnish marks, the pay \nof the librarian being unchanged at 460 marks per annum, although the grant for \nteaching materials had risen by just over 50 per cent to 6480 marks per annum. This \nagain corresponded to the pay of two teachers. Only in the 1888 Regulations was the \ngrant for the library separated from that for textbooks. It became 1400 marks and \nthe librarian got a small increase in pay to 500 marks. These sums continued \nunchanged until the abolition of the Corps in 1903 as part of the russification policy \nin Finland.\nThe library proper, which was housed in two rooms, contained 8073 volumes in \n1863 but had fallen to 7400 volumes in 1874. In 1903 it comprised 12,001 volumes. \nThe regular inspections of the Corps took in the library and in 1869 it was reported \nto contain ‘many useful books both in Swedish and other languages’. The need for \nmilitary instruction in Russian and the Swedish mother tongue of the vast majority \nof cadets and staff ensured that the library acquired books in both of those lang uages. \nThe Russian Main Administration of the Military Educational Institutions, which \nwas responsible for military instruction at the Corps, produced lists of books, which \nthe libraries of the cadet corps and military colleges, including the Finnish Cadet \nCorps, ought to acquire. At various times French, German, and Finnish were also \ntaught at the Corps and these languages, too, became represented in the library.\nBooks were purchased from booksellers in St Petersburg and in Finland. St Petersburg\nbooksellers whose names appeared in the records of the Corps included W. \nMayer, Bruzelius, and Brieff in the 1820s, Glazunov and Ivanov in 1846, Fenon in \n1878, and N. Fenn in 1901. Several generations of Glazunovs were involved in bookselling\nand publishing in St Petersburg and Moscow. Finnish booksellers included the \nimportant firms of Frenckell in Turku and Tampere, and Wasenius (the forerunner \nof the famous Academic Bookstore) in Helsinki. Use was also made of booksellers in \nHamina itself, one of whom was Alexandra Elfving, the first woman bookseller in \nFinland, who was active in the 1870s and 1880s, but who was probably more important\nas a supplier of textbooks than of books for the library. Books and periodicals \nwere bound by bookbinders in Hamina.\nThe Corps always bought a lot of periodicals and newspapers, although it is \nunlikely that most newspapers were retained for long. In the 1820s there were \nsubscriptions to Finlands Allmänna Tidning, the official Finnish newspaper and \ngazette, Turun Wiikko Sanomat, the first nineteenth-century newspaper in the \nFinnish language, Sankt Petersburger Zeitung and Russkii Invalid, part of which \n', '142 J E O SCREEN\nbecame from 1862 the official gazette of the Russian Ministry of War and was always \neagerly scanned for news of promotions and appointments. In the 1840s the Corps’s \nFinance Committee was ordering eight newspapers from Finland and one from \nthe Russian capital. The Finnish liberal Swedish-language newspaper Nya Pressen \nfigured in the subscription lists in the 1890s. At different times there were subscriptions\nto periodicals of a scientific, religious, and literary character from Finland and \nSweden.\nThe library of the Corps kept up well with the great Russian literary journals of \nthe nineteenth century, such as Sovremennik, Otechestvennyia Zapiski, Syn Otechestv a, \nIskra, and Severnaia Pchela. Naturally, it also collected the key professional military \nperiodicals, such as Voennyi Sbornik, Artilleriiskii Zhurnal, and Morskoi Sbornik, \nas well as the important educational periodical, Zhurnal Ministerstvo Narodnago \nProsveshcheniia. The main Russian periodicals were undoubtedly retained in the \nlibrary’s collection. By 1903 the library held forty periodical and newspaper titles in \nRussian and sixty-five in other languages, with a combined total of 2500 volumes.\nThe surviving catalogue of the library for the period from 1872 to 1903 was \ndivided by language, so that books in Russian, Swedish, French, Finnish, and German \nwere listed separately from each other. Russian books included a great deal of literature\nnot only by Turgenev, Tolstoi, and Gogol but also translations from Dickens \nand Scott. Swedish books included more translations, for example, works by Tolstoi, \nCervantes, Scott, and Swift. There were collected works by the poets Frans Mikael \nFranzén and Johan Ludvig Runeberg, the latter Finland’s national poet. However, the \nbooks in Swedish also included much history, biography, and travel: Nils Adolf Erik \nNordenskiöld’s Vegas färd (The Voyage of the Vega) was of course added to the \nlibrary. Books in French comprised mostly literature, whereas those in German \nneglected literature in favour of science, history, and travel. Books in Finnish \nincluded not only history and geography but also translations of Scott and Verne. The \nlibrary also included serious military reading. By 1903 there were on tactics 90 works \nin Russian and 63 in other languages, with a combined total of 285 volumes.\nThe cadets also had their own library, which was run by the Kamratskap or \nFraternity, which played a key role in the internal running of the Corps and the lives \nof its cadets. Catalogues of the Fraternity’s library survive from the late 1870s, the \n1880s, and 1890s. However, the library dated back at least to the early 1860s when \nthe Fraternity intended it to contribute to the cadets’ education and moral advancement.\nThe library was financed from the small subscriptions the cadets paid to the \nFraternity. At first no novels were purchased although they were accepted as gifts. \nLoans were made only to the most senior cadets but later some novels — no doubt \nselected for their moral rectitude — could be lent at the senior librarian’s discretion \nto the oldest of the junior cadets.\nThe catalogue showed that literature dominated the collection. In 1877 there were \n79 volumes of poetry, 26 of drama, 80 of history, 27 of literature, 28 of science, and \n151 described as ‘books of stories’, in other words, light reading. Some years later \nserious reading included Herbert Spencer on education and Edvard Westermarck on \nmarriage (both in Swedish). Swedish literary authors included Strindberg and Gustaf \naf Geijerstam, with Ibsen and Alexander Kielland from Norway. Maupassant, Dumas \nfils, Flaubert, and Pushkin all figured in the catalogue and Finnish-language authors \n', '143FROM HELSINKI TO IRKUTSK\nmade their appearance, for example, the novelist Juhani Aho. The Fraternity subscribed\nto several journals and newspapers, predominantly in Swedish, among them \nthe newspaper local to the Corps, Fredrikshamns Tidning. In the early 1890s there \nwas a subscription to Fliegende Blätter, the satirical magazine published in Munich. \nThe cadets would not have been short of recreational reading and of the means to \nkeep up to date with events. When the Corps was abolished, the Fraternity ensured \nthat the cadets’ library eventually found its way into the library of the National Board \nof Antiquities in Helsinki.\nThe fate of the Corps’s library was decided at the time of its abolition in 1903. \nBoth Russian and Finnish funds had been used to buy books and financial provenance \nhelped to determine where the books went. The Russian Main Administration of \nthe Military Educational Institutions received 602 works which had been supplied \nby Russia as well as some paid for by Finland. These were no doubt sent on to \nother cadet corps or military colleges. Of the books purchased with Finnish funds, \nthe Finnish Archaeological Commission, the forerunner of the National Board of \nAntiquities, received 105 works. The Imperial Alexander University, to be renamed \nthe University of Helsinki after the Russian Revolution, obtained 2979 works in 8387 \nvolumes, nearly 70 per cent of the Corps’s library. Russian works comprised 2750 \nvolumes. This may have led to some duplication because the Alexander University \nenjoyed the privilege of copyright deposit of books published throughout the Russian \nEmpire, the origin of the present fine Slavonic Library at the University of Helsinki. \nSome books and periodicals, which had belonged to the Finnish Cadet Corps, were \nto pass from the University Library, probably in the 1920s, to what is now the Library \nof the National Defence University, Finland’s specialized military library. Volumes \nfrom the Finnish Cadet Corps, for example, on military statistics, topography, and \nartillery, as well as military periodicals, can be found in that library.\nThe second institutional military library in nineteenth-century Finland was that of \nthe Helsinki Yunker School.5 This took its name from the Russian word iunker, \nwhich meant not a landowner but a young nobleman who served as a volunteer in \nthe army in the expectation of becoming an officer. The term gradually became \nextended to apply to officer cadets at military colleges. Systematic training for the \nmajority of Russian line infantry and cavalry officers began only in the mid-1860s, \nbut there had been a number of local initiatives before that to overcome the ignorance \nof military science on the part of the mass of yunkers. In 1846 the Russian division \nstationed in Finland opened a school to give yunkers both general education and \nmilitary training. Part of the cost, including that of the premises, was met by the \nFinnish government, and initially many of the pupils were Finns. The school was \ngradually enlarged, to 100 and then to 200 yunkers, and incorporated into the new \nsystem of yunker schools throughout the Empire in the 1860s. The proportion of \nFinns attending it then declined appreciably. Material about the school can be found \nin Finnish records at the National Archives in Helsinki and its own archive, which \nwas heavily weeded at the time of its closure in 1879, is in Moscow at the Russian \nState Military History Archive. \nThe original drawings of the premises occupied by the school from 1852 provided \nfor a room with a cupboard for the archives and library, but information about the \nlibrary is sparse up to the 1860s. However, a catalogue certainly existed in the 1850s \n', '144 J E O SCREEN\nand yunkers were made to pay for lost books. The school’s regulations of 1861 provided\nfor the establishment of a library ‘for the spread of useful knowledge among \nthe officers, yunkers and non-commissioned officers’, funds were allocated for the \npurchase of books and periodicals, and teachers or officer instructors were appointed \nto be in charge of the library and teaching aids and materials. From 1868 the superintendent\nof teaching was required to run the library. The classes of books, the nature \nof the catalogues and the necessary financial records were all prescribed in the \ninstructions for yunker schools issued in 1871. The annual allocation of money for \nteaching materials, library, and orderly room requirements was not inconsiderable, \namounting in 1864/65 to about 9 per cent of the school’s expenditure, excluding that \non premises.\nThe library books, textbooks, maps, and other materials inherited from the old \ndivisional yunker school in 1861 comprised 350 titles or objects and 1910 volumes or \nitems. Additions during the academic year 1861/62 brought these figures to 512 \nand 2447 respectively. Language and literature together, history, military works, and \nperiodicals each represented about one-fifth of the total; religion, mathematics, and \ngeography and statistics accounted for most of the rest. At this time the library was \nclearly built up on the basis of teachers’ recommendations, but later the Main \nAdministration of the Military Educational Institutions, which was responsible for \nthe content of the yunker schools’ courses, was to prescribe what works a library \nshould have, although that did not mean that local suggestions were excluded.\nBy autumn 1864 the library proper (excluding textbooks and teaching aids) comprised\n516 titles and 1299 volumes. It was thought that the Helsinki Yunker School \nhad a particularly rich collection of books. The library was augmented when the main \nadministration transferred 563 volumes (139 titles) from the libraries of former cadet \ncorps which had been reorganized or abolished. By 1868, the last date for which \nfigures for the library alone could be found, there were 881 titles in 1169 volumes. \nThe catalogue issued by the Main Administration in 1867, prescribing what yunke r \nschools’ libraries should hold, shows the nature and extent of the core collection at \nthe Helsinki Yunker School. The catalogue is divided into two parts, textbooks \nand teaching aids, and library. The works prescribed for the libraries of the schools \ntotalled 579 titles, a figure comfortably exceeded at the Helsinki Yunker School \nalready in 1866.\nRussian literature included 48 of works by Russian authors, as well as the Iliad and \nHorace in Russian translation. Aksakov, Gogol, Goncharov, Derzhavin, Karamzin, \nKrylov, Pushkin, Sollogub, Tolstoi, and Turgenev were represented. There were also \n6 chrestomathies. To help with the vocabulary were 9 dictionaries, including Vladimir \nIvanovich Dal’s important Tolkovyi slovar’. Foreign authors in Russian translation \nwere represented by 25 titles, including works by Byron, Scott, Heine, Goethe, Dante, \nDefoe, Dickens, Milton, Cervantes, Tasso, Thackeray, Shakespeare, and Schiller. On \nmilitary studies there were 87 titles together with 4 reference works and the key \nmilitary journals Artilleriiskii Zhurnal, Voennyi Sbornik, Inzhenernyi Zhurnal, and \nOruzheinyi Sbornik. On history there were 124 titles, on religion 42, on pedagogy 11, \non physics, mathematics, and natural sciences 85, and on geography, statistics, and \ntravel 77 titles. Each yunker school subscribed to the military newspaper Russkii \nInvalid (founded unofficially in 1813 and from 1869 the official organ of the General \n', '145FROM HELSINKI TO IRKUTSK\nStaff) and also to 1 or 2 of the large-circulation Moscow or St Petersburg newspapers. \nIn 1867–1868 the Helsinki Yunker School took eight military and thirteen civilian \njournals, considerably above the norm.\nThe library undoubtedly included the means for yunkers and staff to keep up \nto date with current affairs and military developments and provided a well-chosen \nselection of literary and other works. However, it is clear from reports by the \ncommanders of the School that the yunkers showed little inclination to read serious \nliterary or popular scientific works, despite their availability. Many of the yunkers \nwere characterized as of ‘intense intellectual backwardness’, and this indicated the \ndifficulties the Russian army was having in obtaining a sufficient number of officers \nof a good educational standard.6 There was a sharp contrast between the poor educational\nstandard of officers produced by the yunker schools and those graduating \nfrom the military colleges and the Finnish Cadet Corps, at all of which entrance \nrequirements were much higher and the curriculum more ambitious; results were \ncorrespondingly better and graduates’ subsequent careers more successful than those \nfrom the yunker schools.\nThe Helsinki Yunker School was closed in 1879, largely because the Finnish \ngovernment wanted to use its site to build barracks for one of the battalions of the \nlittle Finnish army due to be formed in 1881. The Russian Ministry of War thought \nat first of using the equipment of the Helsinki School to fit out a new yunker school \nplanned for Tashkent, but this school never came into being. The fate of the equipment\nof the Helsinki Yunker School was still undecided when a serious fire at the \nIrkutsk Yunker School in 1879 destroyed the greater part of its library. This promp ted \nthe Main Administration of the Military Educational Institutions to propose that the \nlibrary from Helsinki should be sent to Irkutsk to repair the loss. This was accepted \nand implemented and so towards the end of 1879 the Helsinki Yunker School’s sizeable\nlibrary of Russian books was packed up and sent to Irkutsk. The explanation of \nthe title of this article is thus revealed.\nThe instructions for yunker schools issued in 1871 formally permitted the use of \nthe schools’ libraries by officers stationed nearby, on conditions laid down by the \nchief of the appropriate military district. It is impossible to say how much use, if \nany, was made of the library of the Helsinki Yunker School by officers other than \nthose teaching at the School, but the opportunity evidently existed. Officers might \nneed access to military books if they were required to give professional talks at \nthe regimental level or if they were preparing for the highly competitive entrance \nexamination to the General Staff Academy. \nThe ownership stamps in many of the books now in the National Defence Universit y \nLibrary in Helsinki bear witness to the fact that regiments in Finland, both Russian \nand Finnish, had their own libraries for officers, supported by official funding.7 Parts \nof the Russian libraries, abandoned after the residue of the Russian military left \nFinland during the first part of 1918, were initially sent to Finland’s new Military \nArchives and later moved to the forerunner of the National Defence University \nLibrary. The fate of the Russian military libraries will be considered below. However,\nit must be pointed out here that much Russian military written material, includ-\ning library books and periodicals, left in Finland was undoubtedly destroyed in the \nwave of reaction against all things Russian, which was particularly prevalent in the \nnew Finnish army. \n', '146 J E O SCREEN\nRussian and Finnish units in Finland often had reading rooms for their soldiers in \naddition to the libraries for officers. The soldiers’ reading rooms were provided not \nonly with some books but also with a few newspapers and periodicals, for example, \nthose officially produced specifically for soldiers, the Russian Chtenie dlia soldat \n(Reading for Soldiers), published between 1847 and 1915, and the Finnish Lukemisia \nSuomen sotamiehille (Readings for Finnish Soldiers), published between 1888 and \n1901. There was also a Swedish-language version of this periodical, Läsning för den \nfinske soldaten. All contained patriotic, moralizing articles about brave soldiers and \na dutiful military life.8\nThe first Finnish unit to provide a library for its soldiers was the Grenadier Rifle \nBattalion, an enlisted unit, which existed from 1846 to 1860. This library, founded \nin 1849 probably on the initiative of the chaplain, was funded by the officers and \nofficials of the battalion and resembled a contemporary parish library. Its books \nwere sold by auction when the remnant of the battalion was disbanded.9 The Guards \nFinnish Rifle Battalion also had a library for its soldiers, founded by the chaplain in \n1867.10 \nThe Finnish army which existed between 1881 and 1901 provided reading rooms \nfor soldiers not only in its principal units, the nine rifle battalions and the Finnish \nDragoon Regiment, but also for the reservists who were liable only for brief periods \nof training during the summer. For example, the Urjala Reserve Company (in southwest\nFinland) subscribed to three Finnish-language newspapers, one national and two \nlocal. There were books, too, but they were little used, and the company commande r \nwas moved to mention in orders in July 1891 his dissatisfaction with this state of \naffairs. \nOn receiving the account of the company library from the librarian, I see to my sadness \nthat during the entire period of training only 38 loans have been made from the library. \nNo man lives without feeding his soul and spiritual life. Learning never harmed anybody. \nThus in future, since reading matter is available, use it for your benefit.11\nWhether because of this exhortation or for other reasons, the number of loans went \nup to fifty-four in 1892 and 128 in 1893. The reading rooms of the principal units and \nthe reserve companies attracted local financial support, given in the spirit of popular \nenlightenment.12 \nOf the Finnish regimental libraries, that of the officers of the longest-lived Finnish \nunit, the Guards Finnish Rifle Battalion, was undoubtedly the most substantial. Some \nof its books have subsequently wandered beyond Finland. Two volumes of Faddei \nVenediktovich Bulgarin’s Rossiia v istoricheskom, statisticheskom, geograficheskom \ni literaturnom otnosheniiakh (Russia in historical, statistical, geographical, and literary\nrespects), published in six volumes in St Petersburg in 1837, which contain the \nbookplate of Lif-Gardets Finska Skarpskytte-Bataillons Bibliothek (Library of the \nGuards Finnish Rifle Battalion), are to be found in the Library of the School of \nSlavonic and East European Studies, University College London. The school obtained \nthem as duplicates from the Bodleian Library, which had accessioned them in 1947, \nbut their earlier travels are unknown. Bulgarin, a journalist, was an important contributor\nto some of the significant literary periodicals of the first half of the nineteenth \ncentury, which were taken by the library of the Finnish Cadet Corps. The officers of \nthe Finnish Guard were obviously keeping up with literary developments in Russia \n', '147FROM HELSINKI TO IRKUTSK\nthrough their library. A photograph of the library taken in 1901 shows officers sitting \nat a cloth-covered table reading newspapers, with tall and well-filled glass-fronted \nbookcases in the background. Another photograph from the same time shows a similar\nsetting for the reading room in the officers’ mess of another Finnish unit, the \nViipuri (Viborg) Battalion, only with far fewer bookcases.13\nThe library of the Vaasa (Vasa) Battalion, which was also housed in the officers’ \nmess, had a very modest beginning in 1881, with nothing more than subscriptions to \nnewspapers in Swedish, Finnish, Russian, and French and to three military periodicals.\nHowever, by 1884 the library contained 70 volumes, of which 22 were on mili-\ntary science and 18 on history, which had been presented from the collection of the \nbattalion’s first commander after his death. When the battalion was disbanded in \n1901 the library’s books were divided amongst the officers or sold. One at least has \nsince found its way to the National Defence University Library in Helsinki. Moreover,\nthe catalogue survives, carefully classified into eleven sections, which covered \nrespectively: Religion and Philosophy; Geography, Statistics and Travel Accounts; \nHistory and Biographies; Natural Sciences; Mathematics; Military Sciences (further \nsubdivided); Military History and the History of the Art of War; Literature and its \nHistory (subdivided by language); Art and its History; Sport and Games; and finally \nPeriodicals, Dictionaries, Encyclopaedias, Maps, Plans, Albums, and Libretti.14 \nThe small Finnish army which existed between 1881 and 1901 eventually created \nits own library. This was the result of the professional ambitions of a small group of \nofficers in the army who began to publish a Finnish military periodical in Swedish, \nFinsk Militär Tidskrift. This came out in 1881–1882 and from 1884 to 1901, when \nthe army was disbanded, and must be seen against the background of an internationally\nwell-established professional military press. The titles of some of the military \nperiodicals published in Russia, such as Voennyi Sbornik, have been already mentioned.\nInformation about what became known as the Finnish Officer Corps’s Library \nis to be found in the surviving portion of the archive of Finsk Militär Tidskrift, now \nin the former Military Archives in Helsinki, and in the records of the Finnish army’s \ncommand staff (or headquarters), at the same archives.15 \nAs the result of its policy of providing for readers what would now be called a \ncurrent awareness service of military literature, Finsk Militär Tidskrift quickly built \nup a library out of the foreign periodicals purchased or received by exchange. Books \nwere also acquired. As early as 1888 periodicals and books had been gathered in the \n‘Journal’s office and reading room’ in Helsinki where they were available to all \nofficers and the hope was then expressed that in time this collection would become \na proper military library. In February 1889 a member of the editorial board was to \nbe paid annually 250 marks as librarian, the fee of the secretary of the board being \nreduced by that amount, which showed how much library-related work had fallen to \nthe secretary. As an indication of the high value of the fee, it may be noted that the \nannual pay of a lieutenant in the army was only 2400 marks.\nThe editorial board of Finsk Militär Tidskrift wrote in April 1889 to the commander\nof the Finnish army proposing the foundation of a military science library, \nthe absence of which, members claimed, was preventing Finnish officers from discussing\nthoroughly any questions of importance to military science. The financial situa-\ntion of the journal seemed likely to permit a regular contribution for the purchase of \nbooks. However, because the interests of the officer corps as a whole were involved \n', '148 J E O SCREEN\nin establishing a library, the commander was asked for additional funds, which \nthe editorial board suggested could be taken from the 800 marks already allocated \nannually to each battalion for its own officers’ library: 100–200 marks was thought \nsufficient. The new library would be able to lend books to garrisons throughout \nFinland and act in the general interest.\nThe commander accepted the editorial board’s proposal within a week and confirmed\nthe regulations for the library in December 1890, thus giving the library an \nofficial status. Library matters took up part of the editorial meetings of Finsk Militär \nTidskrift in September and November 1889 when arrangements were made for the \nprovision of bookcases, an acquisitions policy was formulated (giving precedence to \nbooks in Swedish) and decisions were taken about a catalogue. The draft regulations \nfor the library together with a list of books were published early in 1891 as an \nappendix to Finsk Militär Tidskrift. The preface modestly stated that, ‘It may be that \nboth the library and our journal are of little value, but they are both our own undertakings,\nintellectual bonds which we ourselves have tied’. The Finnish patriotism \nwhich pervaded the officer corps of the Finnish army, and which was exemplified in \nthose words, was soon to arouse the hostility of N. I. Bobrikov, the Russian governorgeneral\nof Finland from 1898 to 1904, and his allies in St Petersburg and contributed \nto the abolition of the army.16\nThe library’s aim was to contribute to the officers’ military education by giving \nthem access to the necessary works of military science. Supervision of the library was \nthe responsibility of the editorial board of Finsk Militär Tidskrift, who appointed the \nlibrarian. Funds came from an annual payment of 200 marks from each battalion and \nany money surplus to the journal’s requirements. The latter source of income applied \nonly in 1889 when the sum of 500 marks was transferred to the library. Thereafter \nthe difficult financial state of the journal precluded further assistance. The library in \nfact created its own deficit from 1892 to 1895, although it then slowly recovered \nfinancial equilibrium and finished 1899 and 1900 with healthy surpluses thanks to a \nnew arrangement by which the army made a central annual contribution to its funds \nof 1000 marks. This was balanced in 1900 by the reduction in units’ contributions to \n100 marks each. Earlier, in 1891 and 1896–1897, the financial problems caused by \nrenting accommodation for the library in the barracks of the Guards Finnish Rifle \nBattalion in Helsinki exercised the editorial board. The solution was for the state to \npay the rent.\nAlthough relatively little of the library’s budget went on the purchase of books and \njournals compared with administration, rent, and binding, the collection grew to a \nrespectable size and strength. The classified catalogue, published as a supplement to \nFinsk Militär Tidskrift in 1893, comprised 923 titles totalling 1475 volumes. The first \nlist of books had been published as a supplement to the journal in 1891, with a list \nof additions in 1892. Classified supplements to the catalogue were published as further\nsupplements between 1894 and 1900. Additions to the library could exceed 150 \nin a year, chiefly of recent publications, although the library also received bequests \nand gifts, including older material. The Finnish Guards Battalion gave 223 works to \nthe library and a large collection of Russian language books published in the 1870s \nand 1880s, given by the University of Helsinki to the command staff of the Finnish \narmy, was added to the library. The 1893 catalogue listed 27 periodical titles, 13 of \nthem from Finland. \n', '149FROM HELSINKI TO IRKUTSK\nIn spite of the aim of acquiring books in Swedish if possible, Russian books \nnot surprisingly predominated, with German second, although Swedish was well \nrepresented. Finnish, French, and English material was to be found as well. The \nlibrary was a useful collection on military studies with also material on some other \ntopics, such as mathematics and sport, which were of professional or recreational \ninterest to officers. The library’s impact would have been greater had the army continued\nin existence beyond 1901. The end of the army marked the demise also of Finsk \nMilitär Tidskrift. The journal’s editorial board in December 1901 decided to leave \ndecisions about the property of the journal and of the officers’ library to a future \nmeeting. Unfortunately, no minutes of such a meeting survive and the immediate fate \nof the library is not known. Books from it are now in the library of the National \nDefence University. \nThe Russian assault on Finland’s autonomous status in the two decades before the \nRussian Revolution and the attainment of Finland’s independence meant that none \nof the military libraries so painstakingly developed in the country after 1809 survived \nintact for the benefit of the Finnish army newly created in 1918. The library of the \nHelsinki Yunker School had disappeared into the vastness of Siberia, but the fate of \nthe surviving archives and libraries belonging to the Russian authorities in Finland, \nsuch as the gendarmerie, garrisons, and fortresses, became linked with that of Finnish \ncultural property in Russia in discussions, which preceded and followed the conclusion\nof the peace treaty between Finland and Soviet Russia at Tartu in 1920. These \ndiscussions continued until the mid-1920s.17 \nThe Russians laid claim to the libraries of former Russian units, administrative \nbodies and officers’ associations. These libraries, unsurprisingly, comprised mostly \nbooks in Russian relating to military science. In the spring of 1918 the Finnish \nauthorities had declared these libraries, like other Russian official property, to be \nwar booty. In July 1918 the Finnish government ordered an inventory to be made of \nRussian libraries, archives, and other collections in Finland. The library books were \nassembled in a rented warehouse in Helsinki with the exception of those found in the \nfortress of Viapori (Sveaborg) off Helsinki, which were left there. Before discussions \nbegan with the Russians, some books from the warehouse had been transferred to the \nFinnish Military Archives and the General Staff. No fewer than twenty packing cases \nof books were sent to the Military Archives in 1921. Transfers were then halted \nbecause of the discussions with the Russians.\nThe Finns hoped to use the considerable number of Russian books still in the \nwarehouse as a bargaining counter with which to obtain the books belonging to the \nformer Finnish state secretariat’s office in Petrograd. The agreement concluded in \nJune 1924 and ratified in July 1925 was based broadly on this bargain. Under \nthe agreement, Finland undertook to hand over what were described as ‘the former \nRussian military libraries in Helsinki’. Not all the books in the warehouse were sent \nto Russia because some were transferred to the Russian legation and trade delegation \nin Helsinki, partly to be sold at auction. Nevertheless, eight railway wagons of \narchives and books left for Russia in 1926, with the books alone filling 266 packing \ncases, the dimensions of which were 80x50x50 cm. Only books in the warehouse \nwere handed over; those in the fortress of Viapori and books found subsequently \nelsewhere in Finland were retained by the Finns. Thus some parts of the Russian \nmilitary libraries in Finland found their way to Soviet Russia, while others enriched \nwhat is now the National Defence University Library in Helsinki.\n', '150 J E O SCREEN\nFor many years that library’s superb Russica collection of pre-revolutionary \nRussian military books and periodicals was shelved with its other collections in \ncentral Helsinki. The books have recently been sent to an off-site closed store. \nThe wanderings of books surviving from the nineteenth-century military libraries in \nFinland are by no means over.\nAcknowledgements\nThis article is a revision of a paper given to the Seminar on the History of Libraries, \norganized at the Institute of English Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of \nLondon in 2008–09.
