NOVEMBER 8, 1913 PUBLISHED SATURDAYS\nmiking patents to\nISSUE ON FINAL PROOF\nLand Procedure Reform Will\nEffect Big Saving In This\nand Other States\nWashington, Nov. 1.---A reform\nin land procedure that will affect\nhundreds, if not thousands, of cases\nin the West was promised at a con\nference to-day between Assistant\nSecretary Jones of the Interior De\npartment and Representative Raker\nof California.\nThe department soon will issue\nregulations to provide that hereafter\ncertificates will be issued by land\noffice registers and receivers at the\ntime claimants for mining lands\nmark their final proof instead of\nholding up certificates until after in\nvestigation by the Government.\nThis would mean a great saving of\npresent delays to which mining\nclaimants are subjected.\nMany Thousands Saved\nSuch a procedure, for which land\noffice experts have been working for\nsome time, will probably result in a\nsaving of thousands of dollars to\nUtah alone, not to mention the many\nother States affected, says the Salt\nLake Herald.\n"Under the present rules,” said\nGeorge E. Hair, chief of the field\nservice of the local land office, “a\nman may come in to-day and ask for\na certificate and get nothing for\nthree months, six months, or more,\nuntil I have time to send a man into\nthe field thoroughly to investigate\nthe case.\n"Meanwhile, if no certificate is\nissued by December 31, the applicant\nhas to do his year’s assessment work.\nThat means money out of his pocket.\nUnder the proposed regulations the\napplicant can get a certificate of pat\nent and if fraud is suspected in his\nentry, final patent can be withheld\nby the commissioner of the general\nland office until the matter is\nthreshed out. Thus no hardship is\nworked on any one.\n"I have a hundred cases under in\nvestigation that I can turn in right\nnow and the applicants involved will\nnot have to spend money for assess\nments if the new rule goes into\neffect.”\nIn France experiments with freez\ning fish in blocks of ice for transjior\ntation are being tried, the theory be\ning that they can be revived by slow\nthawing and sold alive.\nHereafter, if any one accuses you\nof having been drunk, deny it with\nspecific statements as to the number\nof ounces you have consumed during\nyour lifetime and claim that it was\nby the doctor’s orders at that.

Officers of the\nc mpanv conduct the course and the students are scattered from\nirtlaud to 1.1 I aso. There are no paid instructors and no tuition\nees. The students are under salary. None but company employes\naii i ligible and uo married men are appointed, in which respect\nthere is a resemblance to the schools at Annapolis and West Point.\nThe students are between the ages of 21 and 30 and are chosen for\ngrit, ambition, intelligence and efficiency that they have shown in\ntheir previous work.\nme Doutm rn racinc course covers a period of 42 mouths, ap\nproxitnately that of a college curriculum. The beginner starts at a\nmedium sized station, where he serves six months as warehouseman,\n,,,lgKaK**nian and clerk, performing the actual work as any other\nemploye. He is then transferied to auother division to spend three\nmouths iu track work. After he lias learned to handle a spike maul\nand raise low joints, he is moved to the Flood building and puts in\nthree months with the superintendent of transportation. Next\ncome three mouths iu the shops, then the same period in traiu ser\nvice; then three months iu the accounting department, and finally\nthree months in the tariff bureau of the traffic department, making\ntwo years in all.\nUnforseen Result Of Income Tax\nThe new income tax adds to the value of State and municipal\nlKinds, as incomes derived from these are exempt, says the 8. F.\nExaminer.\nSuppose a man has $100,000 invested in securities which pay\n“) per cent. He is taxed 1 per cent upon the income. Suppose be\nsells and invests in State or municipal bonds, paying 5 per cent.\nHe is taxed nothing on the income. Naturally public bonds are\ngoing to find a wide market.\nThe demand for municipal securities created by the income\ntax will undoubtedly lead many capitalists £o favor municipal owner\nship of utilities who have hitherto been strong opponents of that\nsort of thing. And we may expect to see municipal ownership in\ncrease with extraordinary rapidity. —!\nIt is an interesting proof of the unexpected results which\neconomic legislation produces. Our social and business relations\nare so interrelated, so complex and so ramified that only actual ex\nperiment can definitely decide whether economic changes, made by\nlaw, will work harm or good.\nProgress of the Exposition\nRecent visitors to San Francisco report that the grounds of\nthe Panama Exposition are a scene of intense activity. Over an\narea stretching along the ocean for a couple of miles thousands of\ncarpenters and other mechanics are busily at work, creating a citv\nthe like of which the world has never before seen. It is not too\nmuch to say the-the Chicago exposition of 1893 and all its rival\nfollowers have been but pygmies to this Colossus. Undismayed bv\nthe official indifference of certain European nations, San Francisco\nis going right ahead, staking its all, virtually, on the success of its\ntremendous enterprise. The pride of the San Franciscans has been\ntouched; and all that money, bruins, courage, confidence and am\nbition can do, all that engineering skill, scientific knowledge, artistic\nachievement and business acumen can accomplish, all is being util\nized to the avowed end that the Panama Exposition of 1915 shall be\nnot only a fitting celebration of the construction of the canal uniting\nthe Atlantic and the Pacific, but shall stand out prominently in\nAmerican history as a monster and magnificent display of the\nprowess of 20th century civilization.—Anaconda Standard.\nJanies T.

I made a num\nber of inquiries and found that\nStates of our standing were figuring\non erecting buildings to cost from\n$10,000 to $15,000 and it seems to me\nthat this is the amount which Ne\nvada should figure on. What it will\ncost for the collecting and maintain\ning of the exhibits is another ques\ntion and one which it would be hard\nfor us to determine, but it is my in\ndividual opinion that a sum of $70,\n000 should be more than sufficient to\ncarry on the exhibit and cover all\ntfie expenses at the exposition. It is\nour plan to economize wherever\npossible and there will be no fat jobs\nwith big salaries for any one. The\nspending of a large amount of money\nfor the erection of a magnificent\npalace in San Francisco to stand for\nonly a few months would be folly,\nand this we will not do. The build\ning will be a meeting place for the\npeople of Nevada and it is not neces\nsary to build a mansion for this pur\npose. We are granted plenty of\nspace in the exposition building for\nour exhibits and it is my intention,\nas one of the Commission, to insist\nthat the money expended be for the\nbenefit of the State in securing ex\nhibits which will work for its greater\nupbuilding.\n“A meeting of the Board will take\nplace within a short time when we\nhope to arrive at a definite conclu\nsion and will then give to the people\nof the State an outline of what we\nintend doing. We are aware that a\nlarge amount of antagonism has\narisen in regard to the fair, and this\nowing to the fact that such a large\namount of money was appropriated\nwhen the State needed money for\nother matters probably of more\nbenefit to it. The expenditure of the\n$140,000 is not necessary and would\nbe gross extravagance, and I fully be\nlieve that half of it would be more\nthan necessary.’’\nInfantile Paralysis Fatal\n%\nChester Hardesty, 20 years of age,\nson of Mr. and Mrs. Janies Hardesty\nof South Fork, Elko County, died\nlast Tuesday night from infantile\nparalysis. He had been ill but a\nshort time, and his death was en\ntirely unexpected, as he had eaten\nsupper at the table with his parents\nthe evening before the day of his\ndeath. The young man was well\nthought of in the community where\nhe had resided all his life and his\ndeath is a severe blow upon his\nparents, to whom the sympathy of\nhuudreds of friends is extended.\nDr. Hood of Elko reports that\nthere are in the neighborhood of 50\ncases of this peculiar disease in this\ncounty, the only part of the State\nthat seems to be infected. The\ndisease is a baffling one, and is giv\ning the physicians much concern.—\nWells Herald.\nBORN.\nIn Eureka, Nevada, November 2, 1913, to\nthe wife of Alex Muguira, a daughter.\nUtilities Raised Nearly\nOne Million Dollars\nCarsou City, Nevada, November 3.—The State Tax Commission\npractically closed its work on the assessments in the State to-day\nby radical increases bringing the total assessed valuations in the\nState up to $115,000,000 from the former mark of $101,\n000,000, an increase of $14,0W 000. This at the State tax rate of\n66 cents a hundred will provide additional revenue of $92,400 and\nthe additional revenue provided the counties can be figured in dol\nlars by multiplying 1400 by the county rate.\nThis radical increase involves an increase made Saturday on\npublic utilities to the extent of $762,000 and an increase to-day on\nimprovements on mining properties, mills, buildings, etc., of ap\nproximately $500,000. The rest includes for the most part hori\nzonal raises on land, etc., by classes and counties.\nThe increases totalling $500,000 on mine improvements were\nsent out by telegraph to-day to the various County Auditors. Those I\non public utilities were made by mail Saturday.\nThe public utilities raised in the State were as follows:\nTruckee River General Electric Company from $381,639 to,\n$558,150.\n» -w • « . a w» /-v r Art rn aoa l A (Oil AAA\nxwdo rower, a iruiu , ^ ^u^w-r.\nBell Telephone Co. of Nevada from 161,100 to $112,200.\nPacific Power Co. from $55,200 to $75,000\nNevada California Power Co. from $170,382 to $355,000.\nTonopah Sewer A Drainage Co. from $16,000 to $20,000.\nTonopah Water Co. from $120,000 to $150,000.\nGoldfield Consolidated Water Co. from $101,000 to $150,000.\nNevada Telephone A Telegraph Co. from $42,895 to $80,000.\nCarson Water Co. from $47,275 to $55,000.\nVirginia A Gold Hill Water Co. from $156,843 to $175,000.\nThese increases were made by specific order. Utilities in\nWhite Pine, Elko, Humboldt and Douglas Couuties were increased\nby the general raise made in those counties. Increases on banks\nin Washoe County over last year’s assessment added $15,000 and\nthe State increase, including Washoe, over last year, is $65,000.\n“This increase of $14,000,000 in the total assessment valuations\nin Nevada,” said Commissioner Colburn, “means many things. It\nwill provide adequate revenue for the State on its rate of 66 cents a\nhundred. It will equalize assessments by making those paying on\nvalues below the average, pay up to the average. It does not hurt\nthe small owner who is practically untouched, and it is no injustice\nto the large owner who merely is required to pay a reasonable and\naverage value. It results in equalizing the contribution to the\nState from the different couuties, but the most important fact is\nthat it opens the door to the County Commissioners to reduce the\ncounty rate.\n“County rates based on aggregate values of $101,000,000 when\napplied to existing values of $115,000,000 must produce more money\nthan the counties need. A county tax rste based on last year’s\nvalues aud multiplied by this year’s rates, will produce on the aver\naae about 14 per cent more taxes than the commissioners expected\nwhen they levied the tax. In other words every time a man pays\n$100 in county taxes he pays $14 more than he ought to pay to the\ncounty.\n“This added money to the counties will be a surplus paid to\nthe counties by the taxpayers. The Commissioners should see the\nway clear to reduce the county tax rate so that taxes will go down\nevery time assessments go up. They can do this next March but I\nthink there should be some way of rebating the rate for this year\nin the counties when it is found more money will be produced than\nexpected.\n“The thing for the people to remember is that unreasonably\nlow assessments mean unreasonably high taxes, and reasonably high\nassessments mean reasonably low taxes. The counties have the\nopportunity now to cut the county tax rate, and jf they do not, the\nburden of the people will not be high assessments but extravagance\nin spending county taxes.”\nLAST TUESDAY’S ELECTIONS\nDemocratic Governors were elected Tuesday in each State\nwhere this office was filled—Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vir\nginia. With the exception of New York, where the Tammany De\nmocracy was severely rebuked, more Democratic than Republican\nvictories were recorded at the polls.\nMaryland elected a Democratic United States Senator, Blair\nLee. Of the four Congressmen elected throughout the country,\nthree were Democrats. The exception was C. D. I’aige, in the\nthird district, Massachusetts. In Massachusetts there was a Demo\ncratic landslide and Lieutenant-Governor David I. Walsh was\nchosen Governor by a plurality of 53,691 the largest ever given a\nDemocratic candidate for the offi :e. Mr. Walsh carried with hirn\ninto office every Democratic candidate on the State ticket.\nThe Tammauy Democracy in New York State was condemned\nin a manner which left little solace to the leaders. John Purroy\nMitchel, fusiouist, was elected Mayor of New York, leading Edward\nE. McCall, the Tammauy candidate, by 121,209 votes. William\nSulzer, deposed Governor of the State, will go to the Assembly\nfrom New York City. The New York State Assembly will be safely\nRepublican.\nIn New Jersey, James F. Fielder, Democrat, was elected Governor\nwith a plurality of about 22,000 over the Republican candidate.\nThe Democrats will control both Houses in the Legislature.\nIt now develops that when Andrew Carnegie sold out to the\nUnited States Steel Corporation the contract was drawn to provide\nthat the corporation should pay any tax levied by the Government.\nAndy holds something like $300,000,000 of the bonds of the big\ncompany and it will cost the latter about $1,000,000 a year to pay\nthe Carnegie income tax.\nWe once heard of a man who kept his mouth shut and lived\nto regret it—but we have never been able to secure the proof of\nthe statement.\nNevada State News q\n- d\nGeorge Wingfield has bought an c\n$0 acre farm in Churchill l Minty c\nind will use it for a demonstration fc\nfarm.\nThe Huber murder case at Elko d\nresulted in a mistrial, the jury r\nstanding six for acquittal and six for c\nmurder in the first degree. t\nThe Fallon sugar factory is pre- 1\nparing for its Fall run with 3000 tons t\nif beets in the yards and more ar- j\nriving daily at the rate of 250 tons, s\nThe State Police are out with a 1\ncircular asking for the arrest of\nAssemblyman Harvey Harris on a «\ncharge of forgery and embezzle- i\nmentin Lander County.\nNine- boys, ranging in age from 1\n13 to 18 years, were arrested in 1\nReno last week charged with doing \'\nover a thousand dollars worth of 1\ndamage on Halloween night.\nFinding employment for an aver\nage of 100 men a week and dis-1\ntributing several tons of clothing for\nthe poor is the record of the Salva\ntion Army during the past Summer .\nat Reno.\nB.

McFadden, a barber in the Bank\nsaloon at Rochester, “shot up” the\nRed Top bar and dance hall. The\ndead man is William Edwards, dance I\nhall proprietor, who was shot in the\nforehead.\nFrank Manda, Edward’s partner,\nwas shot over the heart and probably\nfatally wounded.\nThe least seriously wounded are:\n“Shorty” Burns, shot in the jaw and\narm; Emma Hoffman, McFadden’t\nwife, shot in the hip.\nBums and the Hoffman woman are\n«xpected to recover.\nMcFadden went into the dance hall\nat about 11:40 o’clock at night. He\nwent to his wife who was working in\nthe dance hall and tried to persuade\nher to return to him. She seemed\npartly convinced by his entreaties\nwhen, it is alleged, the men whom\nMcFadden shot persuaded her not\nto go.\nNo Shot* Mi** Mark\nAngered at their interference,\nMcFadden immediately drew his\nweapon and fired, each shot taking\neffect.\nEdwards fell dead with a bullet in\nhis head and Manda fell with a bul\nlet through the lungs, just over his\nheart. Turning on Bums, McFad\nden shot him in the jaw and in the\narm and, turning again, he aimed at\nhis wife and shot her in the thigh.\nTaking advantage of the confu\nsion, McFadden made his way out\nside unchallenged and disappeared\nin the darkness. He struck out over\nthe desert for Oreana, where he was\ncaught by Deputy Sheriff George\nFarris, who had followed him from\nRochester in an automobile.\nAt the inquest, which is in pro\ngress this afternoon, McFadden said\nthat if he had not left camp immedi\nately after the shooting he would\nhave attempted to kill a fifth person,\nwhom he regards as an enemy be\ncause of the trouble with his wife.\nPaliside News Notes\nN.

Oregon, Nov. 1.—With\nout a sign of clothes, but cooing and\nromping about on the floor and in\nhis mother’s arms, Rex Palmer,\naged six months, son of Mrs. Alice\nPalmer, was the center of much at\ntraction at the Courthouse this after\nnoon.\nThe baby’s presence in court was\ndue to his nakedness. His mother\nis raising him clotheless. Since his\nbirth, she says, he never has worn a\ngarment. Neighbors who saw him\nlying on a pallet in the yard in the\ncool October breezes complained, and\nand mother and child were brought\ninto the Juvenile Court.\n“My baby weighs 20 pounds and\nis only six months old, declared\nMrs. Palmer. “Does that look like\nhe is suffering for want of clothes?"\nExperts who examined the boy\npronounced him perfect physically.\nHe is tanned all over his body a dark\nbrown, but is splendidly developed.\nThe boy does not wear clothes day\nor night. W’hen the weather is good\nhe plays on a pallet in the yard, when\nthe weather is rainy he is brought in\nthe house. He sleeps without clothes\nand covers. When he is to be car\nried from home his mother throws a\nblanket about him, but he objects to\nthis manner of dress and is happiest.\nMrs. Palmer says, when he is romp\ning on his pallet in the yard.\nMrs. Palmer was discharged from\ncustody and took her naked boy away\nin triumph.\nPinS MADE BY THE MILLION\nEngland >lone Produce* 54 000,000 Pin*\ntrery Day 1“ The Year\nIn Jhgland every day there is an\noutput of over 54,000,000 pins. Bir\nmingham. the greatest center of the\nindustry, alone produces 37,000,000\npins per day. The output of other\npin mauufacturers in England is only\nabout half that of Birmingham. In\nFrance the daily production is 20,000,\n000, while Germany and Holland pro\nduce 10,000,000 per day. The total\noutput for Europe each day is, there\nfore, 84,000,000.\nIt is seleom that a pin gets broken\nor worn, and the question is, there\nfore, “Where do all the pins go to?”\nThe greater number of them get lost,\nand there is no other domestic article\nwhere there is so much waste by loss.\nIf every person in Europe lost a pin\non every third day the daily loss\nwould represent over $5000.\nIn former days the number of men\nrequired to make a pin was one of\nthe marvels of the manufacturing\nworld, but as with most other manu\nfacturing products, machinery has\ntaken the place of men, and pins are\nnow produced very much faster.\nThe machines are so perfect that\nthey cut the wire of which the pins\nare made into pieces of the right\nlength, head, point, polish and sort\nthem. They are then put into an\nother machine, which affixes them to\npaper at the rate of 80,000 to 10,000\nper hour.\nIn the fourteenth century pins were\npins! They were not carelessly lost\nas nowadays, or given as a substitute\nfor a farthing change. The law per\nmitted that they should only be sold\non the first two days of January each\nyear, in order that they might not be\ncome too common. It therefore be\ncame the custom for ladies of all\nclasses to buy their year’s stock of\npins on these days, and the money\ngiven them for this purpose by their\nhusbands or fathers was known as\n“pin money”—a phrase that has sur\nvived to the present day.\nLake Tahoe Road Completed\nThe road connecting Tahoe and\nTallac, with a few minor repairs at\nthe close of the Winter, will be ready\nfor the opening of the 1914 touring\nseason. One of the drawbacks to\nthe lake trip has been the barging\nfrom one resort to another on ac\ncount of the absence of a road con\nnecting Tallac to Tahoe. The finest\nscenery is to be found where the\nnew road rounds Emerald Bay. This\npart of the road, which is from 500\nto 1000 feet above the water, is for\nthe most part blasted along the face\nof a solid granite cliff, and in many\nplaces one gets an absolutely unob\nstructed view of both Emerald Bay\nand the lake. At the south side of\nEmerald Bay the road climbs to the\ntop of a hogback, and one has a view\nof Cascade Lake 500 f^et below on\nthe left, of Emeralu Bay 1000 feet\nbelow on the right, and Lake Tahoe\nspreading out directly in front, with\nthe rugged mountains on the Nevada\naide of the lake as a background.\nTo Whom It May Concern\nNotice U hereby given that the jwrtoerahip\nheretofore existing between R.
