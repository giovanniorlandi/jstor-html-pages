Senator Ronan said that, the Governor did not tell hint one, way or another, and that he did not\', ask him., Senator Sutherland declared that, the faction in Sitka which opposed, Mr. Shoup. because Mr. Shoup bought, his provisions in the South, instead, of at the local stores, were friends, of the Democratic machine, and that, it was through their influence that, his resignation had been requested, lie declared that one member of the, Board favored the reappointment of, Mr. Shoup., Senator Heckman said that if the, resolution was written in too strong, terms, he would move that it go, hack to (he committee for amend, ment.

M. Polley for Street Commissioner, to succeed the very competent Commissioner Raymond, was clearly evidence that the Council was not actuated, by politics. Mr. Polley was a candidate for Councilman, 4n the Valentfiiff UCftdV which was defeated by the, C’ouncilmen elected, and he headed his ticket at the, poll. Mr. Raymond refused to be a candidate for the, office, preferring to engage in private business to, working for the City for the salary attached to the, office he has filled so capably for the last year. Mr., Polley, his successor, is a former President of the Alaska, Labor Union. He served in the army until mustered, out after the armistice was signed. Those who know, him best vouch for his ability and interest in public, matters., A. A. Humfrey, the City Assessor, is a capable Ju, neau business man. llis ability and integrity are un, questioned., The new City Attorney, Judge H. H. Folsom, is a, pioneer of Juneau who has a long, efficient and very, creditable public record behind him. He has been, United States Commissioner, Assistant United States, District Attorney, and City Attorney, and he made, good in all of those positions., Nels Sorby, the new Chief of Police, is a pioneer of, Alaska, and has had official experience in the United, States Marshal’s office. His reputation is of the high, est character, and he will give the City the best that, is in him. His declaration that he has no policy but, to carry ont the will of the Council to the best of his, ability is Jthe logical position for a Chief of Police to, take., j While discussing Mr. Sorby it is only fair to him, to say that the charge that he was elected on the, Valentine ticket two years ago and went back on, Valentine is not wholly true by any means. Mr., Sorby was a candidate on the Citizens\' ticket, as well, as the Valentine ticket, and received the votes of those, who supported the Citidens\' ticket. He acted as, conscience and judgment dictated while on the Council,, and he made a good record., it might not be out of place here also to say a word, for the retiring Chief of Police. Ex-Chief Dargan, has made an excellent record in running criminals to, earth. There have been murders, robberies and hold, ups committed while lie was Chief of Police, and in all,, or nearly all, such instances the crime has been fol, lowed by arrests, and usually, convictions., Mayor Gray and the City Council has made a good, start, and all the signs point to a very successful, administration., REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO SAVE PARTY., I "\' -, I^ate newspapers say EUhu Root\'s letter endorsing, the League of Nations was written specifically to lift, the burden of opposition to the League off the shoul, ders of the Republican party. It is admitted on all, hands that the Republicans got themselves in very,, very bad by following so fast and furiously when, Roosevelt started the pack ofT at the heels of Wilson, as the latter sailed away on tlie George Washington tUL, induce European nations to agree to a League of Na, tion? for the peace of the world. Hoot was, and other Re, publican leaders throughout the Nation are being hunt, ed out. and requested to come out for the League of, Nations in order to neutralize the III effects of the, speeches of Ixtdge, Knox, Sherman, Borah, Poindexter, and others and the editorial declarations of Munsey, and the erstwhile Democrat--one Colonel George Brin, ton McClellan Harvey, who was one of the early vol, unteers in the campaign to make Wilson unpopular., While we might well question the patriotic motives, of Mr. Hayes, whose only virtue seems to be that he, saw the havoc that was being wrought to bis organiza, tion earlier than certain bourbon Senators, yet there, will be nothing but rejoicing if the salvage workers, a# the Republican party right before the world on, tb]p Important question before it is too late, it would, be a pity if there were any serious division in America, on this great humanitarian issue. The only chance, for that would be for the Republican politicians to, control their party against the will of the rank and, file. The rank and file of the Republicans are as, strongly for a League of Nations as the Democrats, are., The Dispatch says The Empire called “everybody, clowns.” Wrong as usual. The Dispatch and the little, bunch of politicians who train with it lack a lot of, being everybody. The difference is almost as great as, that between the Dispatch and the census returns., Placer Amendment., (Dawson Naws.), The resolution which came before the Yukon Devel, opment League this week looking to the enactment of, a new law, making it possible to arrange for dredges, to go through adjoining claims which may form a bar, rier between other large dredging tracts, deserves im, mediate and serious consideration. The people of, Yukon should take up this matter at once, and,, through the proper channels, urge on Yukon\'s mem, ber the necessity of enacting such a law., Yukon has suffered much in loss of good money, which would have been distributed in wages and for, supplies byj-eason of various blockaders bolding ground, in the midst of other large properties and practically, delaying operations on a vast scale. The instances, occurred on several creeks, and it is possible they will, occur on several other creeks. Investors in various, properties ae affected and every sort of enterprise, and business becomes delayed, while gold is cut off, and wages stopped. In short, mining congestion takes, place and things come to a standstill., If the blockade process were possible everywhere the, whole country would be tied up. Sometimes a more, strip of one, two or three claims or simply the fraction, of a claim, will block all work. To tear down the, dredges in order to remove them to other ground often, would involve more of an outlay than the properties, are worth, and owners of dredges oftentimes rather, withdraw from a country entirely than be forced to, established a pecedent of allowing themselves to be, held up. Should they become known as submitting, to such treatment, they would be subjected to such, outrages constantly., Hydraulic mining at various places also has been, carried on at a great inconvenience or blocked entirely, by demands of exorbitant prices for key claims. The, holders could easily have arranged to let the ground, be worked in conjunction with other properties. Un, reasonable delays in matters of hydraulicking have, forced some operators to build cribbing or other pro, tection at great expense., Alaskans Should Back It., (Petersburg Report.), The movement started by the newly organized, Commercial Club to secure the dredging of Wrengell, Narrows is one which should have the backing of every, man and woman in Alaska, from Anchorage to Ketch, ikan., For some years it has been a known fact that the, larger boats could not use Wrangell Narrows except, in cases of extreme tide and were thus forced to make, the longer trip around the outside, necessitating a, longer trip, the loss of many hours in their running, time, and in one instance the loss of a fine big pas, senger liner, and its cargo estimated at $1,507,200., Mails and freight have been greatly delayed and, have been endangered by storms and rough weather., Wirangel Narrows is always calm, and always safe,, except in case of foggy weather, which Is apt to occur, at any time at any place., Money spent in dredging in the Narrows would, not have to be respent in a few years as the current, keeps the channel clear in the Narrows at all times., In the past sixteen years the channel has not shifted, and the water on the bar has decreased less than two, inches., Petersburg would be vitally effected by this im, provement as boats which now ply on the Alaska route, and which do not now even pass here, would make, this a regular stopping place. This would result in, better shipping facilities for the fish buyers and result, in much higher prices on the local market. It would, mean better mail service, and better traveling facil, ities for the public., Everything considered it means much to Alaska ■, in general, and it is a project with everything in its ], favor. It has not a drawback as have other dredging, projects. There are no ice fields to endanger the boats,, there are no high winds in the Narrows, and the cur, rent would keep the channel free after it had once, been established., The First Thousand., (Wrangell Sentinel.), When a man gets a thousand dollars saved up there, are always opportunities for a good investment. It is, hard to place much less than that. That is why, wealthy men who are self-made advise youny men, to begin early and save the first thousand., Until we went to war, in order to get a thousand, dollars together one had to go to the bank and put, a little away each month or each week or tuck part, of his salary away in an old sock. It was troublesome, to go to the bank and the sock was too handy., Now, however, there is an easy way to get that first, thousand. The answer is War Saving Stamps. In, them the Government of the United States, backing, those stamps with a guarantee of four per cent in, terest compounded quarterly, opens the way. One can, begin with "two bits.’’, Spirit of Workmen and Wickersham Contrasted., (Douglas Island News.), The action of the employees of the Alaskan railroad, in taking only part of their wages until the first of, July shows that the men have the interests of the, country at heart. If they are willing to take a chance, on the country, some of those persons who are being, paid to represent the Territory at Washington should, at least quit knocking and do a little work for their, money., The vital importance of concluding the peace, treaty at once and without any more speeches than, necessary is becoming so evident that we are very glad, after all that President Wilson concluded not to put, any Senators on our commission.—(Ohio State Jour, nal.), Senator Jim Reed, of Missouri, will swap the round, robin the members of the Legislature in that state, sent him for one presented to Senator Lodge by his, party colleagues and will ask no boot.—(Cincinnati, Enquirer.), Everybody seems to. be more or less Interested In, the Taft boom except Mr. Taft.—Anaconda Standard.), We used to have the jig-saw puzzle and now we, have Russia.—(Philadelphia ledger.), Juneau people can now sleep well at night, secure, in the thought that their fair city is safely guarded, by the frowning guns of a gunboat and two sub, chasers.— (Douglas Island News.), Exchange of 4 „ Liberty Bonds, The Treasury Department has extended the, time for converting i per cent Liberty Bonds, into those bearing 4b per cent., Such bonds, il presented to this bank on or, before May 15, 1919, will be exchanged without, charge., The B.

The millinery stores ai, ready give evidence that the women, folks have been preparing for Easter, Sunday, and the many church af, fairs coming to a close, show that, Lent was generally observed., Women in Juneau declare that, never before have so many pretty, and attractive hats been seen in the, stores, and every woman and girl, in Juneau is determined to have an, Easter hat for Easter Sunday. A, well known authority has this to say, regarding Easter hats:, However, just at present we wo, men are thinking more about our, Easter bonnets than what we will, wear at the fashionable summer play, grounds. Just when or where the, superstition originated that it was, lucky to wear something new on, Easter Sunday I don’t know. We can, most of us recall our early school, days and the great pride with which, we started forth to church on Easter, Sunday with new shoes, or new, gloves or new ribbons. As we grew, older our demands increased. We, LISTEN, CANNERIES. MINES. MILLS, I am waiting for your, work. All makes of boil, ers set up and ovens built., G. E. KRAUSE, Brick and Stone Mason, Juneau - - - Alaska, were no longer satisfied with new ac, cessories to our wardrobe, but want, ed a new hat and frock to cele, brate this joyful occasion., This year women have additional, reasons for being exceptionally hap, py. What more natural than that, they should express this spirit of, gladness by wearing especially pret, ty costumes., Certainly the milliners, designers,, and manufacturers have launched, such a bewildering display of head, wear that any type of woman can, find a hat becoming to her individ, uality. Directoire, Early Victorian, Watteau, Louis XVI., and even Or, iental, especially Chinese hats, are, seen. One can safely select a small, close-fitting shape or a very broad, brimmed hat and still be attired, comme il faut., Just why we are being treated to, such a diversity of styles and per, iods it is hard to explain., Possibly it is one way France has, adopted of expressing her relief at, being delivered from the terrors of, I war. She may have cast a backward, glance over the experience of her, ancestors and considered it appropos, to adopt the fashions of those vivid, periods., At any rate, we are confronted, with an array of millinery quite de, lightful to behold and which recalls, the romantic atmosphere we asso, ciate with the styles of those early, centuries., Quite a number of the poke bon, nets come under the Direcoire period., One very lovely one in cornflower, blue lustrous satin was circled by a, dainty wreath of hand-wrought flow j, ers in harmonizing colors., A fanciful little leghorn must have, been inspired by the artist Watteau.!, Such bewildering little graces as:, miniature ostrich tips, lovable little;, posies, fluttering ribbons, aesthetic, colors and a coquettish saucy tilt to, the whole ensemble, are some of the, features of this charming model., Just at present, quite a flutter of, excitement is being occasioned by, the revival of the Louis JVI. stylos,, especially the bonnet affairs with, drooping sides and low crowns. How, ever, this is not surprising. Now, JUNEAU LUMBER MILLS, Successors to Worthem Lumber Mill., Phone 358 for your lumber orders.

Most like, ly there will be but little business, the first evening outside of appoint, ing a committee on credentials., “The preamble of the Pioneers of, Alaska,” said Frank A. Aldrich to, day "is probably the shortest of any, organization known.
