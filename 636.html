However, in the central area of the mountains resistant \nrock strata dip more gently than elsewhere, giving rise to some plateaus at high altitude . \nThese in turn support larger ice masses, comprising small ice caps and highland ice expanses. \nThe Columbia Icefield is the largest of them. Its massif central is 8 km in diameter and ranges \n2 19 \n", '220 JO U R N AL OF GLACI0LOGY \nin altitude 2 000- 3 500 m a .s.l. (Fig. I). It is drained by four of the largest surviving valley \nglaciers, the South, Columbia, Athabasca and Saskatchewan. The two latter have received \nsubstantial glaciological study (Meier, 1960; Paterson, 1964, etc.), but the Icefi eld itself is \nlittle known because it is comparatively remote and intensively crevassed in the southern \nportions. There are no published determinations of the thickness of the ice. The mean \nposition of the firn line is not established: from our own sporadic observations it has lain \nbetween the 8500 and 9500 ft ( 2600 and 2 900 m) contours in Figure 1 during a majority \nof the melt seasons since 1967. \nMount Castleguard abuts the eastern side of the Icefield. From its base at I 740 m a. s. l. \nup to 2 500 m , the mountain is composed of Middle Cambrian formations of limestone and \ndolomite (Ford, 1971 ) . Th e strata are singularly massive and resistant to m echanical erosion \nand compose a great staircase of benches and scarps. From the geological trends, these rocks \nmust also underly most of the I cefield , which is high ly crevassed because it rests upon staircase \ntopography. \nT\nj , \n. . ,\' \n" \n... \n..... \n~ ..... \n_ . ____ COURSE OF \nCASTlEGUARD CAV E \n, \n\' .. \'\n.jP " \nq . \n,,- . ) \nI C EF IE LD \n. .... \n\'-----r-~~_____",---...,.... ---,,---\'4 * BIG SPR INGS \nSC AL E \nFig. [.

T he principa l passage is an alterna-\ntion of vadose and phreatic parts; vad ose caves are created by gravitational streams en trenching\nthe fl oors of air-filled galleries; phreatic caves enla rge under condi tions of comple te and \nperma nent water-fil l. Dimensions of the passage a re varied but average 15- 20 rn 2 • A characteristic\ncross-section is shown in Figure 3. \nA t the up-stream (north-west) end the cave bifurcates a t PlOO (Fig. 2 ) . T he principal \npassage continues n orth-wes t for 800 m where it is sealed by ice (Fig. 4) which appears as a \nfl at wa ll across the passage. The ice is sligh tly ablated a round the perimeter where it contac ts \nthe rock, bu t it maintains an air-tight seal. No melt wa ter was observed on the three occasions \n', "222 JO U RNAL OF G LA C I OLOGY \nFig. 3. The principal passage oJCastleguard Cave in the vicinifJi oJ P200 .

It is entirely \nunlike the cave ice formed from ground waters or water vapour that is comm on in other \ncaves of the Rocky Mountains a nd is in terpreted as glacier ice of the Icefi eld extruded into \nthe cave passage for an unknown distance. Its a ltitude is 2 295 m a.s. l. and the surface of the \nI cefield directly overhead is at 2 592 m, sugges ting that the g lacier is '297 m d eep at this \npoint. \nWithin 150 m of the ice blockage, stalactites of calcite a re growing actively, i. e. are \nfurni shed with flowing water . Considering this observation and the condition of the ice itself, \nit is probable that the temperature of the extruded ice is o°C or a very li ttle below. * \n* Attempts to get an accurate the rmometer in wcrking cond iti on to this p o int h ave fai led . \n", 'GE O-HYDR O L OG I C AN D TH E RMOM E TRI C OB SE R V ATIO NS 22 3 \nFig. 4.

W altham.) \nDuring the winter m onths a strong current of air flows to the north-west throughout the \ncave to PIOO. H ere it leaves the principal passage and passes across a 30 m shaft into an \ninaccessible fissure. From there it must either pass into the base of the Icefi eld through exits \nthat are not sea led air-tight by ice or follow an unknown gallery traversing further beneath \nthe glacier. \nCastleguard Cave has been abandoned by the ground-water river that created i t or, \nalternatively, the river has been elimina ted by growth of the I cefield in its catchment. From \nU series dating of speleothem s (below) abandonment occurred ~ 1 55 ka ( I ka = 103 years \nB.P. ) . The genetic river has been replaced by innumerable " invasion" waters. These a re \nlater afRuents that chanced to drain across the pre-existing cave; in scale, they range from \ntiny seepages depositing stala ctites and stalagmites to fresh e ts discha rging 1 m 3 S- I at maximum.\nInvasion waters appear everywhere a long the principa l passage save in the " cold \nzone", the first kilometre at the south-east end where a condition of perma frost limits seepage \nthrough the overlying rock . H owever, this zone is subject to complete fl ooding during th e \nsummer when waters rise up from a deeper tributary passage. \nThe discharge of a ll invasion waters is a t a maximum in the summer: m os t have ceased to \nfl ow by the end of the win ter season (April ) . On geological grounds, the sources of these \nwa ters lie north and north-west of the ca ve, i.e. they d erive from the soles of the Mount \nCastlegua rd glaciers and from the eastern m a rgin of the I cefield. \nIn the Castleguard Rivet" vall ey, 2 80 m below the south-east entrance of the cave a nd \na ligned upon it are the " Big Springs", which discharge from impenet rable bedding planes in \n', 'JO U RNAL OF GLACIOLOGY \nthe lower limestones. From considerations of the volume and carbonate chemistry of the \nwaters, Ford (1971 ) has shown that the principal source of the springs (~80% of discharge) \nmust be the base of central portions of the I cefield , probably much of the area lying between \nthe 8 SOo and 9 SOo ft (2 600 and 2 900 m ) contours in Figure 1. The waters must flow \nthrough a second limes tone cave ("Castleguard I!" ), approximately underlying the known \none. The known cave was therefore abandoned as a consequence of re-routing of ground \nwaters rather than the alternative, their elimination by Icefi eld growth, that was mentioned \nabove. Substantial active karst sink holes must exist beneath > 300 m of ice today. On three \nof the four occasions that the Big Springs have been gauged (August 1969) the I cefi eld com ponent\nof their discharge was estimated to exceed 8.S m 3 S - I. Most of the supposed source \narea was overlain by firn at the time. In winter, discharge is reduced to < 0.1 m 3 S- I or c. 1% \nof known summer peak flows . Winter r educ tion of the invasion waters in Castleguard Cave \nis similar in magnitude. \nThe ground-water hydrological observations indicate that there is abundant water at the \nsole of the central Icefi eld and beneath the smaller Mount Castleguard glaciers during the \nsummer months. Waters must derive from the melt offirn and surficial ice because discharge \nis very greatly reduced during the winter freeze up. However, it is not entirely eliminated : \nsome waters are present at the sole of the I cefield even at the end of the winter. Melt waters \nenter the glaciers both above and below the firn line and are able to pass through ~300 m \nof glacier ice in either situation to reach the sole. These p oints suggest that the modern ice \nmasses considered have temperatures uniformly at the pressure melting point or very close \nto it. \n2 . THERMAL FEATURES OF THE CAVE \nFigure 2 displays a variety of thermal data pertaining to the cave and its environs. Temperatures\nwithin the cave are a representative selection of dry-bulb air temperatures measured \nin a traverse of April 1973 that was extended from the south-east entrance as far as P200. \nMeasurements in April 1974 confirmed the pattern . The value ~o.o °C at the ice plug is \nthat inferred above. Water emerging at the Big Springs in August 1969 had a m ean temperature\nof 2.2 °C with little variation. \nThere are no meteorological stations of long record close to the Icefield. Mean annual \nexternal air temperatures (Fig. 2) were calculated by a multiple linear regr\'ession analysis of \ndata from 74 meteorological stations within a 280 km radius of the cave. * \nA majority of known caverns are shorter and at shallower depth than Castleguard Cave. \nThey possess an interior air temperature that changes very little from season to season and is \nclose to the m ean annual external temperature of the locality. Seasonal variation of cave air \ntemperature (and , therefore, possible d eviation of the annual mean from that prevailing \noutside) may be introduced by seasonal inflows of external air or by large streams of water. \nThe problem has been analysed by Wigley and Brown (1971 ) who show that external air \neffects may penetrate 4- SXo, where Xo is a r elaxation length that is a function of cave diameter \nand velocity of airflow. The relaxation length of water effects is some six times greater than \nthat of air effects. \nThroughout the winter season at Castleguard Cave there is a strong and constant flow of \nair from the south-east entrance up through the cave to P 100 where, as no ted , it passes into an \ninaccessible fissure . During the summer, this air flow is reversed. Water effects may be \nneglected because of the very small volume of the invasion waters compared to that of the cave. \n* The relationship obtained was \nf = IO. g - O.00293z- 0.0283Y (0C) \nwhere T is mean annual dry bulb temperature, z the altitude in ft a nd Y the la titude in degrees N of 49° N. \nT he multiple correlation coeffi cient is 0.977 ; the sta ndard error is 0.6 deg. \n', 'GEO- H YDROLOG I C AND THERMOMETR I C OBSERVATIONS \nTaking representative values of passage diameter and velocity of air flow at Castleguard \nCave, Xo ~ 200- 500 m, and the limi t of penetration of seasonal thermal effects is therefore \n800- 2500 m . T he greater part of the cave, lying between PIOO and p80, is insulated from \nthem. If the cave were sha llow, the air temperature in this interior sector would be expected \nto approximate the mean annual external a ir temperature of - 3.0 (±0.6t C. The record of \nApril 1973 shows the temperature rising sharply through a zone of seasonal effects at the \nsouth-east end of the cave that is I 800 m in length and more slowly thereafter to a maximum \nof + 3.6 ± 0.2 °C. * \nThe only feasible source of heat to explain the warmth of the cave interior is geothermal. \nIn Figure 5, geo-isotherms are drawn to accord to the measured and calculated temperatures, \nassuming the basal ice temperature of ~o°C that is suggested by the hydrological observations\n. The geo thermal gradient between the centre of the cave (+ 3°C) and the moraine \n5 10 m above it (-5.9 ± 0.6 d eg) is found to be 0.02 deg m- I. This value is bracketed by the \nwidely quoted range of 0.0 1- 0.05 deg m - I for geothermal gradients in non-volcanic areas \n(Carslaw and J aeger, 1959) . T he schematic geo-isothermal pattern of Figure 5 therefore \nappears reasonable. \n/\'"+ I =geoisotherm, °c \n,,:". ~ = groundwater fissure o , \nI ;- net (schematic) \n\\::-~~\\ : ... ~:~~~.~.:--:\\:\\\\~:~~~ \nSCALE = KMS . \n2 3 \nVERTICAL EXAGER RATION = 3 \'3 \n4 \nI \nFig. 5. Geo-isothermal section of Mount Castleguard and the cave, i,iferredfrolll the data of Figure 2 . \nAs a consequence, it is significant that the geothermal gradient between the cave and the \ng lacier base is much gentler, 0.004 deg m - I ; geothermal heat flow towards the glaciers \nappears to be retarded. It is suggested that this is caused by melt waters (invasion waters) \nabstracting heat as they pass down through small fissures. In F igure 5, hypothetical flow paths \nof invasion waters are drawn to accord to the observed geological and hydrogeological \nconditions in the environs of the cave. T here is an inverse correspondence between the \nfrequency and distribution of fissures and the geothermal gradient. \nAbstraction of geothermal h eat is independently illustrated by the case of the Big Springs. \nAt least 90 % of their discharge is melt water from glacier soles, wi th an initial temperature of \no°C. Allowing for mixing of the ~ IO% of warmer, extraglacial waters it is estimated that \nBig Springs waters measured in August 1969 had gained 1.5 d eg from geothermal sources. \n* T his particula r measurement is a mean of six measurements at the site over a 40 h p eriod in 1973· 1974 \nmeasurements reproduced this va lue. \n', "JO U RNAL OF GLAC10LOGY \nFrom the Castleguard examples, it is suggested that geothermal flow to glaciers that rest \nupon fissured rocks such as many limestones, dolomites, sandstones, etc., may be reduced to \n10- 40 % of the expected flux. This result is consistent with a rough calculation of the effect \nof seepage water upon the heat balance in the rock. We are specialists in speleology and would \nemphasize that the frequency of fissuration in the Castleguard limes tone is lower than in \nalmost any other cavernous rock known to us . \n3. CHRONOLOGIC AND PALAEO-TEMPERATURE STUDIES OF SPELEOTHEMS \nFrom Figure 5, a lowering of the m ean annual external air temperature and/or the basal \nice temperature by 4 deg is required to place all or almost all of the cave below o°C. This \nwould halt the flow of most ground waters except possibly the largest, which in turn would \nhalt the d eposition of calcite speleothems (stalactites and stalagmites) from seepage waters. \nIt is widely accepted that depression of temperature during maxima of the Last Glaciation \ngreatly exceeded 4 deg in extra-tropical areas. The speleothem record of Castleguard Cave \nis therefore of interest. \nNorth-west of p80 (the limit of seasonal thermal effects) the cave is plentifully decorated \nwith speleo thems. They grow in both vadose and phreatic sections and may be divided into \ntwo classes: (a) speleothems, tending to be large in dimension , that grew before a flooding \nevent that effected considerable re-solution of the calcite ; (b) speleothems, tending to be \nsmall , that have grown since the flooding event and display no re-solution: most appear to \nbe actively growing today. \nCalcite speleothems may be dated by Uranium series m ethods if they were deposited with \ntraces of uranium in sufficient amount but no thorium (Thompson and others, 1974). Castleguard\nspeleothems are satisfactory in this respect and the sample record of their ages is \npresented in Figure 6. When collecting in the field there is no way of determining that the \ncomplete age-range of growth has been sampled (or of determining whether precipitation \noccurred in conditions of equilibrium or kinetic fractionation : see below) . It will be appreciated\nthat the age record of speleothem growth in the cave is therefore necessarily incomplete. \n~ \nI I \nor O Il O J![ -21 \n- 20 \nI \n- 20 \nI ~ \n1---1 \n1WARMER\nJ 180 -1 9 \nloo wrl \nMODERN \nCALC ITE \nPOB -18 \nFLOOD \n~I ~ COLDER I EVENT \n-17 \n( I \nc:J 73011 \n!:l e GI III \n1:] 73008 730 10 \n73009 \n10 60 \nf\\f\\J'-v70\n80 90 100 110 120 130 14 0 150 \nAGE IN 103 YEARS BP \nFig. 6.

Growth has been generally continuous \nsince that date and probably commenced somewhat earlier in other speleothems that were \nnot sampled. \nThe most important specimen in 73 010. This was a sample from the stalagmite shown in \nFigure 7. The stalagmite is two metres in height, standing in the centre of the principal \npassage at a place where the cave cross-section was reduced by earli er sedimentation. 73010 \nwas taken across growth layers at the base of the stalagmite. The entire feature has suffered \nsevere re-solution by flowing water which filled the passage and preferentially removed the \nouter (younger) growth layers. The stalagmite therefore grew for some time after the youngest \ndate obtained from it, 93 ± 3 ka. From a reconstruction of its dimensions before re-solution \nit is reasonable to suppose that speleothem growth was continuous until S6 ± 2 ka, the time \nof the youngest dated pre-flood material (73 008). \nFig. 7. Eroded stalagmite standing in the centre of the principal passage 800 m south-east of P200. The f eature is 2 m i" \nheight. It has suffered re-solution by waters of the long-sustained flood event (see text ). It is partly buried by fines deposited \nby the floods and decorated with some subsequent calcite precipitate, including the \'\'false floor" seen at bottom lift. Specimen \n73 010 was taken from the base of this stalagmite. (Photograph by D. C. Ford. ) \n', 'JO U R NAL OF GLACIOLOGY \nU jTh ages therefore demonstrate continuous speleoth em growth from c. 155- 93 ka, and \nprobably until < 56 ka when it was halted by a flood event. It recommenced before 4 ka. \nHendy (1971 ) has shown that oxygen isotopes in cave calcite are fractionated in one of \ntwo ways: either under conditions of equilibrium resulting from the slow outgassing of CO 2 \nfrom aqueous solu tion or kinetically if CO 2 outgassing is rapid and/or if evaporation occurs. \nUnder conditions of equilibrium deposition , the oxygen isotope variations in a speleothem \nare an indicator of palaeoclimate change through the effec t of tempera ture change on the \ncalcite- water fractionation, as in oceanic foraminifera (Emiliani, 1955; Broecker and Ku, \n1969), and the Greenland and Antarctic ice cores (Dansgaard and others, 1969). \nThree speleothems have been analysed for C and 0 isotopic variations. Speleothems \nyounger than the flood event proved to be kinetically frac tionated. This implies that the \nmodern pattern of summer and winter air flow in the cave has existed for much of Holocen e \ntime. Very young, fast-growing straw stalactites in recesses where the drafts are not effective \nand measured relative humidity is > 95 % yield a 0,80 value of - 18.6%0 PDB, compatible \nwith equilibrium fractionation at approximately + 3°C. \nSpecimen 73010 displays equilibrium fractionation ; the record is included in Figure 6. \n[t is considered that the 0,80 variation probably represents a variation of temperature of \napproximately 5 deg, that is 2 deg warmer to 3 deg cooler than the present value of + 3.5°C \nat the site. An increase of 2 deg in the m ean annual external air temperature would not \nsuffice alone to destroy the Columbia Icefi eld. Probably this persisted at approximately its \nmodern dimensions during the period 155- 93 ka. Three warm peaks and one cold trough \noccur in the 73 010 record. The peaks correlate well with 0, 80 peaks that we have measured \nin specimens which grew at the same time in caves in Bermuda and Kentucky. There is also \ngood agreement with the two older of the three raised coral reefs in Barbados taken to represent\nclimatic optima during the Last Interglacial (Broecker and Van Donk, 1970). This \nsuggests that the deep cave speleothems of Castleguard Cave (and therefore the hydrc geothermal\nstate there at a given time) record climatic events of greater than continental scale. \nThe speleothem chronological and palaeotemperature record so far obtained is discontinuous\nand is, perhaps, over-interpreted h ere. However, the trend of findings is to suggest \nthat at no time during the past 155000 years have supplies of seepage water to the cave been \ndiscontinued by freezing at the glacier base and in the cave rock. If mean annual external \nair temperatures declined more than 4 d eg below the calculated values (as would seem \nprobable at peaks of Wisconsinan glaciation), the rock was shielded by contemporaneous \nexpansion of glacier ice temperate at the base. \n4. THE FLOOD EVENT \nAt some time after 56 ± 2 ka (specimen 73008) the cave was filled entirely with water. \nThis is demonstrated by the re-solution of speleothems (reported above) and by the deposition \nof up to 15 m of laminated silts and clays in the passages. These deposits have suffered much \nsubsequent erosion by the freshest waters but sufficient are preserved to indicate that deposition\nwas simultaneous throughout the great length and vertical extent of the cave. Rhythmic \ncolour banding is common in the deposits but is too variable for them to be categorized as \nvarves. However, their nature indicates settlement from a semi-continuous supply of sluggishly \ncirculating water that p ersisted for a long p eriod. \nThe underlying cave, Castleguard 11, will also have been flooded. Therefore, a head of \nwater of at least 600 m was contained within Mount Castleguard. The agent impounding \nsuch a large body of water in well-drained, cavernous rock whilst permitting its continual \nre-supply would appear to be a valley glacier infilling the Castleguard River valley. From the \nU /Th age dating this glacier was, broadly, "classical" Wisconsinan in age. The caves were \nincorporated into the g lacio-hydrologic system of the I cefi eld and its valley-glacier offshoot. \n', 'GEO -HYDR OLOGIC AND THERMOMETRIC OBSERVATIONS 229 \nThe glaciers circulated water not merely at the base; from considerations of hydraulic gradient \nin the rock, the permanent g lacier water table must have been some hundreds of metres \nabove the base of the ice in the Castleguard va lley where trim-lines and other evidence sugges t \na Wisconsinan glacier that was 750- 800 m in d epth . \nThere is no evidence to suggest that the water-fi ll froze at any time within the cave. We \nhave seen the effects of such freezing in other caves situated above Wisconsinan glacial trimlines\nin the Canadian Rockies. Wall rock and speleothems display very dense patterns of \nshatter. These are absent in Castleguard Cave. \nCONCLUSIONS \nMost parts of the Mount Castleguard glac iers and a substantial portion of the Columbia \nI cefield belong to a hydro-geological system discharged through Castleguard Cave and the \nBig Springs. The modern ground-water h ydrology sugges ts that surface glacial m elt water \npenetrates to the bases of these glaciers during the melt season , both above and below the \nfirn line. Winter discharge from the glacier soles is reduced to c. I % of the summer volumes. \nThe geothermal flux to the base of the ice is significantly lower than expected because the \nheat is abstrac ted by melt waters passing through the fiss ured rock. These conditions may \nhave persisted for most of the past 155000 years . During som e part of the last glaciation \n("classical" Wisconsinan) when the ice mass was greatly expanded, the glacial water table \nwas some hundreds of metres above the sole in a valley glacier draining the Icefi eld ; the caves \nwere flood ed as a consequence. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThese researches were suppo rted by grants from the National R esearch Counci l and the \nDepartment of Energy, Mines and Resources, Canada.
