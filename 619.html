THE BEDROCK\nWilliam J Bryans Estimate of the\nVote that Will Land Him In\nthe White House\nNew York Oct 20A Lincoln\nNeb dispatch to the Herald says\nThe prospect of his election to the\npresidency as viewed from the stand\npoint of William J Bryan is here giv\nen for the first time It represents an\nultraconservative analysis of the ac\ntual situation as viewed from the\nBryan standpoint today and embodies\nthe judgment of men who are closest\nto the candidate The forecast takes no\naccount of the possibility of a Bryan\nlandslide which many of his inti\nmates believe is impending\nIt will be observed that this bed\nrock estimate gives to Mr Bryan\nconfidently the 166 votes cf the Solid\nSouth which includes the eight votes\nof Maryland and the eighteen votes of\nMissouri It also gives to him only\nnineteen electors west of the Missouri\nriver being those of Nebraska 8 Col\norado 5 Montana 3 and Nevada 3\nThus he Is given iron clad 185 of\nthe 242 electoral votes n necessary for\nhis election This leaves the Demo\ncratic candidate fiftyseven shy of the\ngoal Beyond the shadow of a doubt\nit is believed by his friends here he\nwill get both Wisconsin and Indiana\nbringing his assured strength In the\nElectoral College up to 213 or twenty\nnine short of the required number\nReduced to a table these figures show\nCertainly for Bryan\nSolid South 166\nNebraska

opinion as to\nwhere the needed twentynine votes\nare most sure to come from All of\nthem express a higher degree of con\nfidence In Ohio than New York\nShould he win New York and lose\nOhio holding to what has been given\nhim the presidency would le his with\nten votes to spare but should he lose\nthe Empire state and carry Ohio he\nwould still lack six votes According\nto the matured judgment of some of\nhis best informed intimates who them\nselves have carefully Investigated the\nmatter he is as sure of carrying Kan\nsas as he is of Nebraska With Kan\nsas ten votes added to Ohios twenty\nthree there would be a surplus of foUl\nBryan votes in the Electoral College\nThe weight of opinion here touching\nthis combination is that the chances\nare more favorable for Kansas joining\nOhio in a revolt against the old alli\nance than there is In New York doing\nso Many of the candidates closest\nfriends in Nebraska as elsewhere in\nthe West talk as if they would be pe\nculiarly gratified if he should win the\ncontest this time without receiving a\nsingle electoral vote east of Maryland\nThey contend that this would admin\nister a salutary lesson to the East and\nwould result in a rearrangement of\nwhat they allege to be alliances in\nthat section between great financial\ninterests and parties and factions that\nare unreasonably hostile to Mr Bryan\nUnder the arrangement believed to be\nprobable the Bryan vote is thus ex\npressed in tabulated form\nSolid South 166\nWest of Missouri 19\nWisconsin 13\nIndiana 15\nOhio 23\nKansas 10\nTotal 246\nHow

as\nold\nRecently several interesting rumors\nhave been afloat regarding immense\nales of Everglades lands but no sales\nof unusual magnitude has been con\ncluded that is no definite official an\nnouncements of conclusion has been\ngiven out for publication although\nthere have been some decidedly big\ndeals in the air including that of 1\n500000 acres for as many dollars\nmention of which was recently made in\nMetropolis\nAt least one deal however seems to\nhave hung fire on account of the at\ntitude of Attorney General W H El\nlis who was In the city several days\nlast week The transfer of state\nproperty requires the signatures of all\nmembers of the Internal improvement\nboard and It is understood that the at\ntorney general refused to affix his\nsignature to one deed for two reasons\nthe first being that he did not think I\nthe land claimed to be wrth 20 per\nacre should be sold for one dollar per\nacre and secondly if the land was\nsold he insisted that a good share be\nI given to the school fund which is\nnearly a million dollars in arrears be\ncause the last legislature although\nliberal in the matter of making some\nappropriations provided no means\nI whatever

SEYMOUR\nPhone t85\nilfbi IiI j s > i i\nA CHAMPION WITH THE AX\nEdward Moot of Vermont Cut and\nStacked Five Cords of Wood\nIn One Day\nThe Shah of Persia during a recent\nvisit to England refused to become\nenthusiastic over a horse race or even\nto attend it He said he knew very\nwell that one horse could run faster\nthan another and it didnt make the\nleast difference to him which horse it\nwas The recent Olympic games In\nLondon which aroused great intorest\nand some enthusiasm in various parts\nof the world did hardly more than\ndemonstrate that one man could run\nthirtytwo miles in a shorter space\nof time than another man that one\ni\nman could throw a hammer further\nthan another that one man could\njump higher than another and so on\nthrough the list of exercises of brawn\nand endurance that are called\nsports But in the whole list there\nwas not one gainful everyday oc\ncupation represented among the\nsports It seems that when an ath\nletic exercise has to do with work\nand not play or amusement it is not\nto be classed as a sport wherefore the\npublic is not interested in records for\nplowing ditching railsplitting nail\ning on shingles wheeling raw bricks\nto the kiln and the like That is why\na recent woodcutting contest against\ntime in Vermont the other day at\ntracted the attention of only a few\nmen who had a dispute among them\nselves as to how much wood could be\ncut and corded by an expert axman\nIn a day And yet it will be admitted\nthat a contest of this kind is valuable\nin that it sets a mark of earning ca\npacity for the man who cuts cordwood\nfor the support of his family\nSome weeks ago several gentlemen\nin Washington were discussing wood\nchopping when a Mr Evarts said he\nknew of woodsmen in Vermont who\ncould fell chop split and stack five\ncords between suns Another man\nfrom Alabama or maybe It was Geor\ngia doubted that any such record\ncould be made He said he knew\nsomething abouf cutting cordwood\nthat two cords was an average days\nwork that three cords were excep\nI tional that four cords might possibly\nbe accomplished by an expert but he\ndidnt believe the limit could be car\nried to five He was willing to back\nhis judgment and knowledge of wood\ncutting with a wager Mr Evarts\naccepted the wager the other gentle\nmen fell in on one side or the other\nand quite a neat purse was made up\nThe contest was held one day recent\nI ly It was witnessed by a railroad\npresident an assistant secretary of\nthe United States treasury one or\ntwo United States senators several\nnewspaper people and a few others\nEdward Moot of Vermont was the\nchopper selected by Evarts He went\ninto virgin bass woods hear Windsor\nVt at an early hour accompanied by\nhis witnesses and with the first peep\nof the sun struck his first tree When\nhe had finished his five cords from\nthe standing tree to the woodpile he\nhad one hour and twentyeight min\nutes to spare with still half a cord\non the ground ready to be stacked\nHe received 100 for winning the\nwager for Mr Evarts Moot is about\nfortyfive years of age He stopped\nchopping twenty minutes during the\nday to eat and momentarily two or\nthree times to take a swallow of bran\ndy and milk When he had finished\nhe declared himself strong enough to\ngo for another cord which he said he\nwould put up in the time left before\nsunset Was not this performance\nquite as creditable to Edward Moot a s\nif he had run a mile in twofifths of\na second less time than another man\ne wonder if then are woodmen in\nGeorgia who can do five cords or
