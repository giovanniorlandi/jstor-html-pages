It is hardly to be won\ndered that the manufacturers have\nlost tbeir bearings and hardly kuo.v\nwhere they are at on this subject.\nThe Protective leugue and the Home\nMarket club on the one side are Unit\ning into their ears that to ease up by\never so little on .be present tariff\nwonld be to abaudon the whole\ntheory on which the wonderful mm\nscientific tariff has been const rucu-ii\nand wonl I soon bring ruiu on its\nbeneficiaries. The manufacturers\nand the trusts evidently believe this,\nfor tbey donate liberally to thy\nleague to carry on the fight for no\ncbauge. Ou tbe other timid, they are\ntold by the champions of reciprocity\nthat their markets must lie enlarged\nor :boy wi.l not be aula to dispute of\ntheir surplus products, which under\ntbe stimulus of protection and the en\normous profits they are thusenabled to\nma te in the homo market, have rap\nI lly grown beyond what our own\npeople can purchase. If no market\nifl opened for their surplus iu foreign\nlands, production must be reduced to\nthe home markot level. As both of\ntbeeo schools of political economists\npromise just the ideal coi.di.xujs that\ntha tusts and manufacturers want,\nthey naturally favor both factions*\nnot seeing, possibly, what a ridicu\nlous position Ibey occupy. There are,\nhowever, some manufacturers and\nothers interested who do not foel fo\nkiudly towards recpirocity. For in.\nstance the hosiery bikI knit goods\npeople of Now England find that\ntheir industry has been sacrificed by a\nreduction of 20 per cent n the reci\nprocity treaty with France. Tlie\nseed growere, with a like reduction,\ndie nut growers the same and the\npruno growers with ten per cent all\nof whom declare will reduce their\nprofits by that proportion without\nany corresponding advantage or reci\nprocal arrangement. Theta are the\nmain kickero at reciprocity, outside\nof thoso who claim that the constitu\ntional limitations restricting the or\nigm nfull revenuo lays to the house of\nrepresentatives in nullified because\nthose reciprocity treaties are orig\ninate! by tha executive. I\'liese tariff\ndoctors are certanily considerably\nmixed, and withal they do not touch\ntbo burning qiiemiou of the tariff of\nwhether trusts\' production that are\nsold to foroigncro cheaper than they\nare to our own people shall be placed\non the free list. hat is the Dctneo\ncratic contention, and some few miti\ntrust Republicans believe so, too. ?\nBx.\nAll Chrifsn I* l>en??*ljr Populated.\nProfessor Adametz, who devoted\noonstderablo timo to the stud) of the\nfragrant subject, said thnt the popu\nlation of an ordinary cheese when a\nfew weeks old ia greater than the\nnumber of persons upon the earth.\nProfessor Adametz made pome in\nteresting researches dealing with the\nminuto organisms found in cheeso.\nFrom a microscopic examination of a\nsoft variety of Gnu > ore cbiefe lie\nobtained the following statistic!\': In\nfifteen grams of cheese, when per\nfectly fresh, from 90,0(HI to 110,000\nmicrobes woro found, and when the\ncboeso was seventy day* old the pop\nulation had increased to 800,000 hi\neach fifteen grauu.

This\nshows an excess of 100 per cent of in\nsane persons of foreign birth above\nthe proper ratio. iVliilc these figures\nare for New York, the State where\nforeign i mm in ration a kes its lirst\nentry ami its greatest ii ipression. the\nexcess of foicign insane is but little\nless in most other States, particularly\nthose of the northern licit. Under\nthis showing it is proposed to urge\nCongress to amend the i in migration\nlaws iu such a way that persons of\nunsound mind or showing tendencies\nto insanity shall ho excluded. It is\nproposed that a consular certificate\ntie required to the effect that the in\ntended immigrant has not within ten\nyears been confined iu an asylum and\nis not insane or epileptic, and that\nprovision be iiinde for the deportation\nof all persons who shall he-otuo in\nsane within two years after arrival in\nthis country.\nSppiU, .H?9?hI*.\nIn order to facilitate the delivery\nof seeds, Mr. Ncwiands requests all\nthose desiring a quota of seeds next\nspring to send in their applications lit\nthe present time, thus assuring an\nearlier delivery than would otherwise\nbe possible.

When the\npic\'.ure arrives Mr. Xixoti said he was\nsatisfied there would be no dil\'icuity\niu deciding as to whether Lough\nbauixh is oue of the bank robbers.\nKver since the bank was robbed\nover a year ago the Pinserton Detec\ntive Agency has been working <>u the\ncase and finally obtained evidence I\nenough to tix the crime on Georne\nParker, alias "Hutch Cassidy." and\nilarrv Loughbaugh, alius liarrv\nAlouzo. the identity of the third mau\nbeing unknown. Both Loughbuugh\naud Cassidy ate ei convicts, the\nformer having escaped from tiie Wy\noming penitentiary and evaded the\nollicers ever since. When Hie Great I\nNorthern train robbery waa commit !\ned lust summer the crime was fasten\ned upon Cassidy and Loughbauuh\naud two others and the ollicers\nthroughout the country have been ou\nthe lookout for ttiem ever siuce, this\nvigilance resulting iu the arrest of j\nthe latter and his woiuau accomplice\niu St Louis Wednesday. I\'ho St\nLouis police think that the woman\ntook part iu the train robbery dis\nguised as u mau. it is not unreason\nable to suppo-ie thai she played the\nsame part iu the Winuc nucca bank\nrobbery, being tbe third rubber,\nwhose identity bus always been a\nmystery.\nThe prtss dispatches from St Louis\nsay that Cassidy is known to have\nbeeu iu that city a few days ago, ii>\nwhich case it is very likely that tl.e\npolice and detectives will run him\ndown\ni\'he rewards ofTcn-d for Lmgh\nbaugh and Cassidy are ?1,000 each\nby the First National liank and the\nAmerican I\'aukeni\' Asa >cia\'s<>n, to lie\npaid upnu their delivery u> ?n oliicer\n<>f tiie Slate of Nevada and tin ir\nidentitication as the \\\\ iu in- iimiikvi\nbank robbers.
