He gained Va»l\nKrantz, an eminence which was supposed\nto command the surrounding district. He\nwas confronted by defenses and forces\nwhich he would not assault. The com\nmand was held to await reinforcements\nand heavy artillery from the rear. The\nmeager reports convey the impression\nthat it was not practicable to convey the\nguns to the new position. A retreat was\nordered, and the latest report is that\nBuller is lmck at his old post south of the\nTugela river. The opinion is expressed\nthat Vaal Krantz was a trap not unlike\nSpionkop, in which the Knglish soldiers\nwere exposed to a fire from positions that\nwere impregnable and out of range of the\nKnglish guns.\nThe British had advanced on other po\nsitions simultaneously with General\nBuller. The general news indicates that\nthey have all fallen hack. There is there\nfore no progress to Ik* reported. The Kng\nlish are supposed to have suffered heavy\nlosses at Vaal Krantz. Generals Methuen\nand Warren assailed from fortified posi\ntions, ami they too must have suffered\nsome loss. No definite report of casualties\nhas been furnished the news gatherers.\nThe Knglish are reported to have been\ndumbfounded when the report of this\nlatest repulse was made public. All at\ntempt is made by the Knglish writers at\nhome to outline a wise generalship in\nwhich the late advance and retreat are a\npart of a wise system of war tactics\ninaugurated by Buller and Roberts, but\nthe Knglish people are overwhelmed\nw ith grief at the news of the reverses.\nThe Knglish war office gave out the\nnews of the retreat and refused to reveal\nfurther particulars or any plans for the\nfuture.\nThe Elk City Strike.\nA very rich free gold quarts strike is\nreported from Klk city. It is claimed\nthat Ira Lamoreaux has struck a fourteen\ninch ledge on the Depoait claim on\nAmerican river two miles from Klk city\nIt is estimated that one ton of ore now on\nthe dump will yield $100,000 or $50\npound.\nIt is estimated that a man with a hand\nmortar can extract $1000 a day from this\nore. These figures are very large. The\nmining man who knows nothing of the\nconditions prevailing 111 this camp will\nthink this story is incredulous. How\never when it is known that hundreds of\npieces of float have been found in this\nlocality in past years that were as rich as\nthe ton of assorted ore reported to he »11\nthis dump, this story will not appear to\nl»e improbable. This isjust such a ledge\nas the prospectors in that region have\ndreamed of for a quarter of a century.\nFire in Buffalo Hump tamp.\nThe Buffalo Hump syndicate, controlled\nby Clark & Sweeny of Spokane, suffered\nthe loss by fire of its henkhouse and\nstorehouse February 1. The loss is esti\nmated at $15,000. The syndicate had a\nsaw mill and a 10 stamp quartz mill stored\nsaw stamp quartz\niu the houses that were destroyed, beside\n>ther machinery, tools and supplies, and\n200 pounds of giant powder, which ex\nploited with a terrific report. The fire\nwas caused by a defective stove setting\nre to the floor.\nThe loss is quite serious, occurring at\nthis time of year, as it is almost impoasi\nhie to get supplies in. and it was the in\ntention to set up and operate both mills\nthis winter.\nRELIEF FOR HOMESTEADERS\nScoator Skoap\'s New Amcadmeel (live, Ihc\nKcsertalioa Settler, Till Jaly I, 1901\nWashington, Feb. 6.—Senator Sbcup\nhas introduced an amendment to the In\nlian appropriation bill extending the\ntime of payments «lue from settlers on\nIndian reservation lands purchased by the\ngovernment from Indians and sold to\nsettlers, for another year, or until July 1,\n1901.\nHe also introduced an amendment pro\nviding for the salary of the agent at the\nNez Ferce agency, which was left out of j\nthe hill in the h\n. also to increase thr I\nappropriation for support and civilization\n_ \'\nof the Nez Ferce Indians from f 1\nprovided in the house bill, to »2500.\nHe also introduced a hill appropriating\n$ioo,wx> to sink artesian wells in Idaho,\nunder regulations to be prescribed by\nthe secretary of the interior and at such\npoint* as he may direct for the purpose\nof testing whether the force of the sub\nterranean water flow in that state can l»c\nmade available for irrigation of arid\nlands.\nTbe Building: Ordinance.\nThe more the building ordinance is\nstudied the greater its absurdities lie\ncouie. It is a conglomeration almost\nwholly inapplicable to present conditions\nhere, ami to kaep it iu force would place\nan embargo upon building and a tax on\nenterprise with no other result than to\nfatten the pockets of the rmllding in spec\ntor.\nNo one denies the fact that a building\nordinance properly drawn, might prove u\nbenefit to the city, but to say that the\none now grafted on the citizens is tuch a\none is an utter absurdity. A building or\ndinance is designed to guard the health\nof the citizens against unsanitary condi\ntions. It guards against dangers arising\nfrom fire, lack of sewage and proper ven\ntilation. In a city like Lewiston, such\nregulations might he made within a lim\nited area, but to extend the strict regula\ntions of the present ordinance to the city\nlimits is to go without the bounds of all\nreason.\nFor instance, the ordinance specifies\nthat the building inspector shall receive\none dollar and fifty cents to inspect an\nopen shelter shed built anywhere in the\ncity limits. What is in an open shed\nthat demands inspection? What health\nof the citizens ts safeguarded by having\na "civil engineer of ten years\' experience"\nexamine an open wagon shed? What\nwould he examine to make his $1.50?\nThe ventilation, doubtless, or the light\ning Probably the elevator service or\nthe fire escape.\nWhat is there iu the sanitary condition\nof a horse shed twelve feet deep and\ntwenty-five feet long that makes it\nhealthier for the citizens of Lewiston\nthan one a third larger or twice the size?\nWhat public utility is served by a law\nthat prohibits a citizen from putting elec\n, • •• 1, • . . - , , .\ntrie lights into his home or business ,\n4 - - *. 1 ÄV j\nhouse until he gets a permit and suffers\ninspection anti pays one dollar.\nWho is there to say that the judgment\nof the building inspector is infallible?\nSuppose damage arises from defects not\nUncovered by the inspector. What re\ncourse has the city? It will he observed\nthat the building inspector under this\nordinance has given no indemnity Ixmd\nto the city. In all cities it is customary\nwhere a building inspector is employed\nto have him give an indemnity Imnd.\nIn the pondrous compilation nowin force\nin the city of Lewiston, why was such a\nregulation overlooked?\nThese are a few of the glaring absurdi\nties of the present law, and others will\ndevelop as the public comes in contact\nwith it in its operation. A prominent\ncontractor and builder remarked to a\nmendier of the city council: "It has cost\nyou $100, hut if not repealed it will cost\nthe citizens many hundreds of dollars\nwith no benefit whatever except to create\na new office and to give Homebody a job?"\nTrain From Kendrick Tomorrow.\nWork has progressed rapidly on the\nN. 1 *. construction this week and they\nreport today at the railroad office that\nthere will be a train here from Kendrick\ntomorrow. The gaps will Ik* all closed\ntoday between here and the big bridge\nover Bear creek.\nThe reconstruction work has been done\nthree divisions. One force of men\nworked from Fotlatch to Juliaetta, an\nother from Juliaetta to Kendrick, and the\nthird Iront Kendrick to Vollmer. The\nfirst two divisions will complete their\nwork today, and on the third division\nnothing remains to Ik* «lone excepi to\ncomplete the work on the big bridge on\nBear creek. The contractors say th\nthey can haye the bridge ready to cross\nby Monday night. Agent Hooper how\never gives them till Thursday to have the\ngular service reinstated.\nRumors that the train service would\nbegin w ith a transfer service at the bridge\nare hardly to he credited, as the bridge\nw ith approaches is over 700 feet long ami\nlocated at a point w here transfer is almost\nimpossible. But with no delays the road\nwill be operating on regular schedule by\nThursday, the 15th, five days earlier than\nthe first date announced.\nj\nShoshone County Will Pay.\nThe Board of County Commissioners o!\nShoshone county held a special meeting\nthis week to compromise the question of\nliond issue. James F Babb, the attorney\nfor the bondholders, was present, ami a\nfull discussion of the matter led to a reso\nlution being adopted by the hoard\nwhereby the order made Octot »er 13, iHqy,\nstopping the payment of in teres* on the\nbonds, was revoke L It was further or\ndered that the treasurer of Shoshone\ncounty should continue to forward money\nto the American Exchange bank in New\nYork for the payment of the coupons\nsaid bonds as they mature. This settles\nthe vexed question of repudiation in\nfavor of prompt payment. Shoshone\ncountv honors her obligations.\nA New Disease.\nIisease has appeared ill town\nI Iw •5 ™P 1 \'\' ra! * arc P* 1 ul \' ar\n*\nha s\nP""\'*" 1 t, " ctor * to n " kr * dû*.««..\n\' i,..t il.o v.r-ii riiliiiuratili nlifitvi, a ilurlc *\nlint the x-ray radiograph shows a dark 1\ncoating on tile lungs resembling a linen 1\nfilwr.

Silver Leaders Tried I, Stem Ike\nTide a,d Lome I Delay, Bat Wert\nNal Heeded.\nThe change of sentiment In south hlnho\nthat haslieeu going on for the past year\ncrystalizeil Tuesday in the action taken\nin the two strongest silver counties in\nthat part of the state. The result is the\ndistutiiding of the silver republicans and\ntile reunion of their forces with the forces\nof the old party.\nA mass meeting of over 300 silver re\npublicans met at Rexburg last Tuesday.\nI\'pon roll call it was found that nineteen\nprecincts were represented and eighteen\nof that numlicr voted for dissolution of\nthe silver republican organization. The\nfollowing resolution was adopted:\n"Whereas, The precinct committemen\nof the res|rective precincts of Fremont\ncounty having made their report as to the\nsentiment of the silver republicans in\ntheir respective precincts, said sentiment\nbeing as follows: Nineteen precincts be\ning represented and eighteen of said pre\ncinct committeemen having Ireen in\nstructed by the silver republicans of their\nprecincts to vote for the dissolution of\nthe silver republican organization Now,\ntherefore, lie it\n"Resolved, That the object and pur\npose of the silver republican organization\nin its inception was to aid In establishing\n, billlf , hat rml «,i,l or K an\nj u ^ on declared its willingness to co\noperate with any j»rty actuated with a\nlike purpose*; that more than three years\nhave passed since its organization, within\nwhich time every silver republican of na\ntional repute, except one, has been re\ntired to private life through the partisan\ngreed and treachery of the democratic\nparty, and in their places have lieen\nplaced, in some instances, men known to\nbe enemies of bimetallism ; that within\nthat time it has been demonstrated that\nfusion is impracticable and unsatisfactory\nand that it can serve no pur|K>se except\nto aid in building up and placing in\npower the democratic party, which is\nalready pit\'paring to wholly abandon the\ncause* of bimetallism; that, further, more\ntime has brought forth new issue\'s upon\nwhich, according to the training of fifty\nyears, the democratic party has taken 1\nstand in opposition to the flag, even 1i\nhelling the soldiers in the field, and has\nplaced itself in such an attitude that, as\ncitizens and patriots, we can 110 longer Ik*\nknown as acting as their Ally or giving\nencouragement to their unpatriotic effort.\nThat is, therefore, the sense of the\nsilver republicans of Fremont county that\nlissolvè our organization and take our\nstand with the old }>artv with which we\nare in full accord 011 all questions excepi\nhi metal li sin, for which we prefer to fight\nwithin the ranks of the party of progress\nand patriot fain thin as an ally of a treach\nerous foe. \' \'\nThis defection is Incoming epidemic.\nOn Tuesday the two wings of the repub\nlican party in Blaine county met at\nHailev. Each appointed a committee of\nconference. The joint committee re\nommended that the wings formally dis\nsolve their respective organizations and\nreorganize the republican party of Blame\ncounty.\nThe report being adopted the follow\ning preamble and resolutions were\nadopted by the silver republicans:\n"\\V1 ereas, tin conditions that seemed\nto justify the organization of the silver\nrepublican party are materially changed\nfor the la-tter, and,\n"Whereas, the continued existence of\nthe said party as an organization is use\nless. impolitic and only calculated to aid\nand al»et the opponents of the princip.es\nfor which we stand, be it\n"Resolved, That we silver republicans\nof Blaine county, Idaho, hereby disband\nour party organization, and be it further\n"Resolved, That we emphatically in\ndorse the principles of the republican\nparty and the administration of President\nMcKinley as eminently calculated to in\nsure the pros|K*rity of the I\'nited States\nand the welfare of humanity.\nThe reunited party effected a reorgan\nization and installed their officers. There\nis to be a republican club organized in\nevery oreclnct or group of precincts in\nBlaine county. Several populists ami\ndemocrats indorse the move of the re\npublican*, and there is not a dissenting\nrepublican.\na\nTHE ICE MAN NOT IN IT\n«irait Thai Will Draw frail oa Asktrces\nFall» Insured Afaiast Cadlla Molk.\nWoolly Aphis or Sa* Jot« S<al«.\n"The compensation of the building in\nspector shall Ik* fees paid by parties oh*\ntaming permits, and all fees shall Ik* paid\n* in advance.

I ». Click, James Coonan and Andrew\nJohnson. The latter two took the Klon\ndyke erase and sold their interests early\niu the stages of development of the mine\nto J. C. Jensen, and dc]iarted for the gold\nfields of the north.\nIt might Ire added 011 the side that\nCoonan struck it rich in Klondyke, This\nis one of many instances of luck haiiut\ning her favorites.\nA company was organized last winter to\ndevelop the French creek Klondyke.\nFirst a tunnel was run 100 feet The\nshowing there was good. Then another\ntunnel was run 100 feet lower 275 feet, on\nthe ledge 160 feet, gaining a depth of 150\nfeet. This work revealed a aoo-foot ledge\nof average of alxmt $8 in gold. While\nthese values were not startling the char\nacter of the ore was very encouraging. It\nis of that porphyritic character that has\nrevealed wonderful values in other camps.\nThere are quantities of arsenical sulphides\nof Iron that were thought to give promise ;\nof high gold values iu sulphide solution.\nThis character of vein filling has lieen in j\ngreat favor with mining men in recent i\nyears. Various camp* produce dlitinc- j\nlive ores ot kindred character, with all\nthe variations and degrees of mineraliza\ntion found in porphyry belts. These con\nditions and\' the increase of values with\ndepth and with the occurrence of solid\nformation encouraged the owners of\nKlondyke at all stages of development.\nThe most important discovery of the\nseason is the revelation that a telluride\nexists in this mine. Some very high val\nues are ii dicated by recent assays. The\nchange to this character of ore with gold\niu solution gives new possibilities to an\nextensive mineral lieft of the Lewiston\ndistrict* The Dewey mine has revealed\na gold sulphide which is closely ielated\nto a telluride. The eruptive formation of\nthe Dewey camp is not remotely different\nfrom the Klondyke ore. The discoveries\niu the two camps of gold in these forms\nplaces a great lieft in the category with\nCreede and Cripple Creek. The discov\neries of these two mines are more\nsignificant than any others of the\npast. If this fact is properly un\nderstood by the milling world it\nwill justify a greater interest than that\ncovered by the Buffalo Hump discovery\nof last year. If the porphyritic dykes of\nour interior are to reveal zones of tellu\nridea ami high grade sulphide ores, a new\nphase is presented to the milling world.\nThe Klondike mine is operated by the\nOro Fino Gold Quartz Milling company,\nwhich is incorporated under the lsws of\nWashington. The place of business is\nnow Spokane; hut it will probably l»e\nof the stockholders, which will lar held\nnext mouth. It is the intention to run a\n1\nChanged to I-ewiston at the next meeting\nthird tunnel Soo feet in length to fully\ndevelop the mine. After that mills will\nlie constructed for the treatment of the\nore. The operators arc* prcK*eetIiug on a\nsafe plan.

The elder Martin proceeded wim\nwork which was hack from the river in\nthe orchard and not at a point front\nwhich the ducks could be seen. He\nheard the report of the gun in due time\nand supposed the young man had fired\nat the ducks. He worked on till noon\nwondering why the young did not join\nhim. He was surprised to learn upon\nreturning to the house that Feartey had\nnot returned after shooting at the ducks.\nOuter vat ion revealed that the skiff in\nwhich the young man croased the river\nwas still twacked at the landing on the\nopposite side of the river,\nThe continued absence and the dr\ncumstances of the boat being left atone\nso long caused uneasiness; and tbe father\nproceeded a half mile down the river to\na point opposite the Warren farm and\nhallooed across the river. His neighbor\ncould afford no clue to the whereabouts\nof the young man. A boat was secured\nand a search instituted.\nAt the l»oat landing where the skiff\nwas t»eached the liody of young Martin\nwas found. He was stark in death.

The\nGovernor\'s qualifications never\nsuggested his candidacy, lie has !\nnot one qualification that would j\nmake him a logical candidate. Ifis J\ndesigns have iteeu apparent from\n!\nlogical conclusions for some time\nHis avarice has no bounds, and no- 1\nl Kid y would be stitpiised if lie\nwanted eveiylhing insight. His\nburning desire to succeed Senator\nSlump has been the incentive for\ndireful political crimes extending\nover a period of four years. His\ndegradation began with perfidy\nand betrayal of confiding friends to\nreward intrigue and treachery on\nthe part of political schemers, when\nhe rewarded fraud and discounted\nhonor. He cut loose from the hon\nest politicians of the State in his\nearly official career, and virtue is\nnot virtue after the first blotch is\nimpressed upon the social or polit\nical character. Stetinenherg since\nhis first fall has been a hopeless\npolitical harlot. He has resorted\nto political hara-kiri upon every\nopposing force that lias clia\'lenged\nhim. His course in t le Cieur\nd\'Aleues, when followed along the\nvanishing months, lias been the\nmost daring political outrage of the\npast century. While nobody con\ndones the crimes of the Ctetir\nd\'Alene rioters, and while every\nand\npolitical organization and every\ncommunity stands ready to aid\nin crushing the lawless ele\nment in that district, those who\nwould uphold law cannot en\ndorse the official oppressions any\nmore than the anarchy of that\nmining catnp. The motive lor\nthis oppression is Steunenberi;\nambition to become a United States\nSenator He forfeited the politi< ul\nfriendship of the democratic leaders\nof Shoshone county by an act of\ntreachery; and he could not\nmove this obstruction to his\ncendency except by annihilating\nthe power of the enemy. Nobody\nwho knows Stcuuenberg doubts\nbut what be would resort to this\nextreme lor selfish ends. Nor\nthere any doubt that he did commit\nthis outrage from purely selfish\nmotives. He might have\nearly in the development of his\nplans that he worked only to re\nform the comiuunty. Hut since\nhe has supplemented his infamous\npeimit system with petitions which\nembody present endorsements ot\nthe state administration, and all\nlaborers lielieved for cause that\nth.-y must sign these peti\nth.-y must sign these peti\nlions ot have their pciniits to\nlabor revoked. How this act can\nbe construed to Ire wholly in the\niuterest of peace is a mystery\nThis senatorial desire affords\nmore plausible motive.\nSENATOR SHOUP\'S GOOD WORK\nTlie activity of Senator Stump in\nmatters pertaining to the wellare\nof his constituents is having a far\nreachiug effect Idaho and Idaho\ninterests are being zealously\nguarded. By the Senator\'s effort\nIdaho will have an oppoitunit) to\nreceive the benefits of the exten- j\nsion of rural free delivery ol llie- i\nU. S. mails. The benefits accruing\nto the districts thus favored have\nbeeu of such worth that all healthy\nwide awake localities are clamor\ning for the establishment of the\nsystem Idaho is fortunate to re\nceive recognition, and this result is\ndue entirely to the influence ot\nSenator Slump. Another thing ol\ninterest to the people of the State\nis the attempt made lay Senator\nj\nj\n!\n!\nShoup to secure an appropriation !\nof #150,000 to Ik* expended in bor\ning for artesian water Jo the State\nof Idaho. In many jkh lions of the\nState irrigable land* may he re\ndeemed cheaply if artesian water\ncan lie obtained, and the conforma\ntion of tlie country i« such as en\ncourages investigation along this\nline.\nThe cattle buyers from the cast\nare now laying llicir plans for their\nregular spring pur. loses. 1 he\nstock output of the Clearwater re\ngion has been a surprise to even\nthe liest informed business men in\nthe past. The drain upon the re\nserve stock has been a serious prob\nlem since the beginning oi the hard\ntime era of i v 93 The ordinary\nresources of the settlers were in\nadequate to meet domestic de\nmauds, so the reserves ol breeding\nstock were cut down to a limit that\nwa\naid to threaten the ruin of the\ntrade. livery year this demand ot\n(lire nece sity has been pressing in\na smaller or greater degree, and j\nthe alarm has continued that the\nLewiston district would soon be i,\ndepriv d of the cattle industry as a\nparamount source of income. I. very\ny.ar, however, the ranges and the\nranches have sent their quota to\nswell the great aggregate of stock\n! for export. Last season was j>er\nj hops the premium year in the his\nJ tory of the trade. This year\'s\ndemand is very strong both for\n! beef and range cattle. The supply\nseems to be good, too. One local\ndealer says the supply in sight jus\ntifies contracts on his part to lur\nlisli his correspondents with at\neast 5000 cattle. The average\n•rice ol cattle this year will lie over\n#30 a head. Thus one sale will j\nbring #1 50,000 here to Ik: distrib\n1\nuted. And after these years of fear 1\nof a dangerous reduction of the j\nsupply the outlook is more favora- !\nble now. The farmers have stocked j\ntheir farms from small beginning s\ntill the visible reserve this year is\nmore than too per cent greater j\nthin it was two years ago. The j\nreservation homesteaders have ac\nlinmlated at least 10,000 bead of I\ncows since the reservation ranges j\nhave been converted into farms. !\nThis growth was unobserved by\nthose who prophesied the loss of\nhis resource of our country. The\n>utput of surplus from this time\nwill increase rapidly for several\nyears. Lewiston will bethegreat\nst cattle-shipping point in the\nNorthwest in the near future. The\nbusiness is now on a permanent\nasis. It ir auxiliary to the farm.\nThe lange is secondary now to the\nranch, and the change is a health\nful one.\nTlic railroad situation has taken\nmove definite shape in the past few\ndays than had been reve.Jed to the\npublic before tlie last issue ol llie\nTeller. It is demonstrated lry the\nrevelations of the past week that\nlocal interests are altogether sub\nordinate to gigantic trans-conti\nuentnl interests. The Vanderlielt\nsyndicate is now formulating a\ntrans continental system that will\nbe the most elaborate in the history\nof the world. The northwest\ncoast is to be the terminus of this\nsystem.

He has, since\nMonday, been in charge ol Sheriff Rozeu.\nThe specific charge against Mr. Hunte\nis the transfer of his stock of goods to the\nBargain store of Orangeville for less than\ntheir real value, in order to realize cash\nfor himself in such a way that he could\navoid payment for the same. The pro\nprietors of the llargain Store, E. G.\nSweet, F. I). Richardson and J. A.

Republican pride is\nla-ing aroused by the plea that their\nparty has ever been the friends of free\nhomes. They are reminded that they\ngave the people the original homestead\nlaw and it would violate republican\ntradition to falter in the present free\nhomes movement.\nA Growing: Demand. *\nThe Lewiston Milling Co. have found\nan active and increasing demann for the\nflour from their new mill.
