In such\ninstances, however, the contest for\nthe nomination, carrying with it as it\ndoes the equivalent of sure election,\nis usually so spirited as to give the\naspirant for office all the fight he\n¥j\nwants an ^ in reality as much as the\nother fellow experiences who has to\nstruggle for both the nomination and\nelection.\nExperience has shown that it is the\npropensity of men serving one term\nin the Senate and House to seek re\nelection. This is a readily understood\nand natural desire. They want to\nbe endorsed, to be vindicated. To j\nlose renomination carries with it a\nsense of having been "turned down" ;\n; by one\'s constituency and no man likes j\nthat. So, even in instances of men i\n: being disillusioned with congress, |\n1 fading it after practical experience\nunsuitable to their tastes, and unre\n| munerative to many of them, they\n; seek another term for their own per\nsonal satisfaction.\nThen, experience has shown, after\nawhile many of them get the "Con\ngressional habit."

The ar-1\ngument which may be advanced from\ntime to time that the utilization of j\nwaste material in times other than\nwar is not necessary, is fallacious, be\ncause it is very essential that some\nmeans of offsetting the H. Ç.

Fully ninety\nper cent of this material can be re\nclaimed through the proper efforts.\n"The Department of Commerce has\non hand a limited number of publica\ntions on Waste Reclamation which it\nwill be glad to send interested per\nsons."\no\nThis is STUDEBAKER year.\n-o\nGreenwood like all wideawake\nprogressive cities has her hous\ning problem handicap .

His only relative was his young\nsister, Faith, a beautiful girl beloved\nb yall, but especially by a fisherman,\nLuke Allen. All the village knew of\nthe romance, except Job Coffin—\nfrom him their love was kept secret.\nOne evening during a raging storm,\n; the simple.love story came to a dra\n! îatic termination. The anxious watch\n, ers on the beach saw the little fishing\nboats come safely into port one by\none, but Luke\'s was not among them\nand later his lifeless body was cast\nupon the coast.\nThat night, alone with her brother,\ni Faith confessed that Luke was her\nlover—that they were to have been\nmarried in the Spring and that she\nwould soon be a mother. The fury\nof the stern man was terrible and his\nvengeance paralyzing.\n"From now on," he cried,\nshall be an outcast from your kind,\nyou shall live outside the world, see\ning no one and being seen by none.\nTrue to his word he took the brok\nen-hearted girl to a lonely lighthouse\nin the Carribbean Sea — \'Ception\nShoals. Here little Eve was born, a\npledge to the grieving mother of\nLuke\'s love. Her happiness was short\nlived, however, for Coffin denounced\nthe child to be the result of a con\nsumate sin and vowed that she should\npay the penalty of solitude.
