GARTIN, Cartln Is Dead and Slmms Is In Jail, Details of the Horrible Tragedy, as Brought Out at thovCor-, oner\'s Inquest-Prelim., Inary Examination, ., On Sunday morning about 4 o\'clock,, in the Parloc Exchange, Theodore,, better known as "Doe," Gartin and A., L. Sims, engaged in a fight, which re, sulted in the death of Gartin., The details of the affair are about as, followand are taken from the state, ments ofNvitnesses before the coroner\'s, jury:, An hour earlier than the tragedy oc, curred Gartin had a quarrel with Flor, ence Mahlics, a prostitute, in the wine, room in the rear of the saloon, and the, woman threw dishes at Gartin and he, in turn threw a revolver at the woman., Simms, who was not present at the, row in the wine room, remonstrated, with Gartin for having a row with the, woman, and was told by Gartin that it, was no affair of his and advised him to, keep out of it. Gartin invited every, one in the house to drink, and while at, the bar Simms kept talking to Gartin, about the quarrel with the woman, and, Gartin became angry at his remarks, and pulled a gun and struck Simms, over the head several times with the, gun. After the first blow Simms drew, a knife and stabbed Gartin in the ab, domen. Gartin dropped his gun- and, Simms continued to use the knife until, interfered with by the bystanders, one, of whom took the knife from him at, the point of the revolver., When Gartin staggered back Simms, said, "I\'ve killed him and I\'m glad of, it." In a moment afterward he ex, pressed regret for his action., Al Hudson, one of the witnesses to, the affray, picked up the gun Gartin, had dropped and asked Simms to give, up his knife. This he refused to do,, when Hudson told him he would kill, him if he did not hand over the knife., Simms then handed over the ugly, weapon. The knife used by Simms, was a long hunting knife, and keenly, sharpened., Gartin was placed on a table, and, Drs. Robinson and Miller were called,, and were joined by Dr. Brannen. Gar, tin was horribly cut. There were four, wounds in the leftside of the abdomen,, one large enough for the bowels to pro, trude. There were three openings in, the large bowel made within a space of, eight inches. His left wrist was cut, across, as were his fingers. The in, injuriCs were dressed by the physicians, as best they could. It was evident that, at least two of the wounds were fatal., Gartin was removed to the Carrollton, Hotel, and died about six hours later., Simms, who was employed as car re, pairer at the Arizona Lumber & Tim, ber Company\'s shops, after the fight, went to his room in Milton, where he, was arrested by Sheriff Johnson and, taken to jail to await an examination,, which takes place to-day., "Doe" Gartin, who was a cripple,, his left leg having been amputated, below the knee several years ago, was, well-known here. He had been in, charge of the crap game in the Parlor, Exchange, and had but recently re, turned from a visit to hisformer home, in Missouri., Theodore Ga\'rtin leaves a mother,, v, sister and two brothers, A. R. and Bert,, who reside in Winslow. Another, brother resides at Kansas City. They, were all here Monday to attend the, funeral, whichMook place from the Ad-, ventist churchat 4 o\'clock Monday, afternoon, and was largely attended by, friends of deceased., T. A. Flynn has been retained by, Simms as attorney and he will be as, sisted in the defenseby E. E. Ellin, wood. Simms has been here but eighteen, months, coming here, it is said, from, Texas. He was known by his acquaint, ances to nearly always carry his knife,, and has on more than one occasion, threatened to use it. The revolver, used by Gartin in the fight was found, on examination after the affair to be, unloaded., CoronerQuinlaii summoned a jury, Sunday and an inquest was held Mon, day. The jury returned the following, verdict:, We, the undersigned, the jurors sum, moned to appear before the coroner on, the 20th day of October, to inquire into, the cause of the death of Theodore, Gartin, having been duly sworn ac, cording to law, and having made in, quisition after inspecting the body and, hearing the testimony adduced, find, that the deceased was named Theodore, Gartin; that he came to his death on, the 20th day of October, 1901, from, wounds inflicted by a knife in the, hands of one A. L. Simms, with the, intent to do great bodily harm to said, Theodore Gartin, and we do recommend, that the said A. L. Simms be held to, await the further action of the court., A. A.

Bail was fixed in the sum of, $5,000, in default of which he was re, manded to jail., When the editor of this paper wants, to buy a pound of butter or a sack of, flour he does not go around asking, merchants for bids.

It gives the return of 16J, tons of ore from the Brougher Bros,, lease that averaged 5376.41 per ton., This is nothing to the results ob, tained from the mines of this county., Fourteen tons of ore from the Night, hawk mine, Layne Springs, netted, $19,500 afterdeductingsmelting charge, of $20, packing $2.50 and hauling $4.50, to the ton. " -, The G. A. R. mine at White Hills, shipped a 16-ton car of ore that con, tained $18,000. Other small lots of ore, have given as high as $8,000 to the ton., A shipment from the Metallic Acci, dent in early days gave a return of, over $16,000 to the ton in silver. To, day the values being extracted from, the ores of the Golden Gem mine ex, ceed by far the values contained in the, richest ores so far shipped from Tono, pah, and yet there is no excessive crow, ing over it. In the C. O. D. mine there, is seven feet of ore that runs over, 80 ounces silver and nearly one ounce, gold to the ton, while there is three feet, of ore that contains 2,200 ounces silver, and several ounces gold to the ton., Mohave county is by far and away, the best mining field on the Pacific, coast to-day, and mining investors, recognize the fact and are putting, their money into mining enterprises in, this county. We have all the necessary, facilities for cheap mining, and before, another year rolls around the great, electric possibilities will be taken up to, aid in broadening the scope of mining, possibilities in this part of the terri, tory. Mohave Miner., THE ALBUQUERQUE FAIR.., The Most Successful Affair of the Kind, Ever Held In New Mexico., On Tuesday, October 24, opened the, Twenty-first Annual Territorial Fair, at Albuquerque, N. M. It was the, most successful fair ever held in New, Mexico. On Monday the visitors began, to arrive, and kept pouring in until by, Wednesday evening it was almost im, possible to get a room in the city., The formal opening took place at the, fair grounds at Old Town Tuesday af, ternoon, the opening address being, made by Governor Otero of New Mex, ico. The governor and staff arrived, Monday night, and were met at tht!, train by the fair committee and escort, ed to their carriages. Headed by a, band the gubernatorial party were con, ducted to the Commercial Club, the, New Mexico Guards acting as escort., After the formal opening of the fair, by the governor the program was car, ried out as arranged, with a few addi, tions. The baseball was all one could wish, for, the National Leaguers playing, re, sulting in a victory for Albuquerque., The horse racing was exceedingly good,, trained horses from Colorado entering., Troop G, United States cavalry, sta, tioned at Fort Wingate, were one of the, features of the fair, with their sham, battles and drills. The Navajo Indians, with their native dances, in Indian cos, tume, were the leading feature of the, entire exposition., Friday was Elks\' day and the even, ing was the maskers\' night after ten, o\'clock. The Elks\' ball was held at, Colombo hall, and all who were fortu, nate to be present said it was some, thing to be remembered., The cowboy tournament was very, good. The hall of exhibits was crowded,, each county sending their share, and, was very good., The fair closed Saturday night, and, everyone went their way thoroughly, satisfied with the week\'s entertain, ment. The baseball teams left for El, Paso Saturday night, where a series of, games will be played, from which place, they intend touring the republic of, Mexico., Flagstaff was well represented at the, fair. Among the notable guests from, Arizona was Governor N. O. Murphy,, who took a prominent part in the state, hood convention, putting in a good, word for Arizona always., H. D.

Desperate Effort to, End the Life of Deputy Sheriff John, Blevins of N&vfto County., About 12 o\'clock Saturday night two, or tlireo soldiers of F troop, who were, camped here, says the Holbrook Argus,, made a most cold-blooded attempt upon, the life of -Deputy Sheriff Blevlni. It, seems that a few of the boys were, getting rather boisterous and Blevins, had given them a sharp talking to and, had gone homo for the night, in com, pany with Ike Perkins. Shortly after, arriving at Mr. Blevins\' home, on the, north Mile of the track, steps and talk, ing were heard on the porch, and al, most immediately two or three men, stepped in front of the door, which had, ghi!-s panels, and commenced firing into, the room., About ten shots were fired, and the, guns were so close that the woodwork, was powder burned. Two of the shots, took effect in Blevins\' right side, one, above and one below the nipple, the, lower one shattering one of the ribs., Uncle Ike also had a very narrow, escape, as one of the bullets passed, through his clothing and dropped into, his shoe., Mrs. Blevins and Mrs. Al Stevenson, were in the house at the time, and it is, a great wonder that more damage was, not done. Whether drink was the cause, or not, it was the most deliberate at, tempt to take life we have heard of in, a long time., One of the men identified by Blevins, as one of the party was arrested the, next morning, and later in the day, Justice F. J. Wat iron took into custody, two others who hud deserted the camp, the night of the shooting and ate sup, posed to be implicated in the affair., It has been a long time since Hol, brook has witnes-ed a scene of this, kind, and we are exceedingly sorry, as, we do not believo that John Blevins, hiis an enemy in the country, and there, was absolutely no cause for such an at, tack. We understand from army olll, cials that the men implicated have, heretofore botne a good reputation., District Attorney Burbage is here, and a preliminary hearing will be held, before Justice Waltron Monday., At this writing Mr. Blevius is in a, fair way to recover, and unless blood, poisoningshouldset in will pull through, all right., A Jerome Hold-Vp., Employes of the Charley Hong res, taurant were thrown into an unusual, state of excitement about 8 o\'clock, Wednesday morning by a hobo named, Thomas Grady attempting to rob one of, their number. The restaurant cook, was in the basement of their building, cutting meat when he was approached, by a white man, who grabbed the, butcher-knife and started to go through, the cook\'s pockets, who gave the dis, tress signal In his native tongue. In, less lime than it takes to read this the, basement was filled with gesticulating, Chinamen, held at bay by the wuuld-be, robber flourishing the butcher-knife, taken from the Chinese cook, it be, came so warm for Grady that in des, peration he threw the knife at the, cook and made a line for the door, fol, lowed by the Chinamen, who caught, him just outside of the building. Mund, Charley, one of the huskiest of the, Jerome colony, wus delegated to hold, the prisoner and the rest scattered, through town to hunt for an officer., Grady soon broke loose and attempted, to lose himself in the ciowd, but wus, kept In sight. For over an hour he, darted in and out of houses, trying to, shake the Celestials, only to find on his, exit one of them at a safe distance out, sldo the door., Marshal Roberts finally arrived and, took the man out of tho Reception sa, loon. The chase was witnessed by over, 100 men, who were unable to get tho, straight of the trouble, tho Chinamen, giving their orders in their own tongue., The prisoner celebrated his entrance, to tho city jail by setting fire to his, bedding Wednesday night. By tho, time tho town was thoroughly aroused, and tho fire department on the scene, he was nearly suffocated. Jerome, Reporter., A Fn.ta.1 Accident., George Gray, a teamster in the em, ploy of Gene Cram, hauling lumber, from the sawmill on Pinal mountain,, met with a fatal accident last Tuesday, on tho Roggenstroh road, about ten, miles from town.-, In coming down a steep grade the, brake on the wagon broke, and becom, ing entangled in the brake rope in some, way Gray was jerked from his seat and, thrown under the wheels, which passed, over his right shoulder and foot. Tho, wagon was loaded with 2,000 feel of, large timbers, and Gray was badly, crushed. The team ran off the bridge, at the bottom of tho grade, and horses, and wagon were precipitated to the, bottom of the gulch, about fifteen feet., The accident occurred about noon,, and Gray was found two hours later by, J. C. Echols and George Elder, team, sters, lying near the wagon, having, crawled about 100 yards to tho gulch to, get water. Gray was conscious for, some lime after He was found, and, talked of the accident, but remembered, little of what happened after he fell, from the wagon., Almost immediately after Gray was, found a man was sent to town on horse, hack after a doctor, and Dr. Malsch, hurried to tho scene of the accident,, but when he got there Gray was past, relief and died u few minutes later. He, bled profusely from the wound in the, shoulder, and probably Internally also., Silver Belt., A Typical South African Store., O. R.

These, bands of bad men defy the officers and, have already had several battles which, tesulted in tho death of several deputy, sheriffs. It is time they were cleaned, out and tho service of the rangers will, be tested in their present undertaking., THE appointment of Democrats to, federal positions in the Southern States, Is a new departure in polities. Since, assuming otlicePtesident Roosevelt has, appointed a judge of the federal court, in Georgia and an Internal revenue col, lector in South Carolina, both gold, Democrats. In this it is said that the, president is only carrying out the, policy detet mined on by the late Presi, dent McKlnley. Tho policy has some, things to commend it, but it remains, to bo tried., THERE has been a good deal of talk, over the entertaining at dinner of, Booker Washington, the leading col, ored roan of America, by President, Roosevelt, and much of the talk has, been nonsense. If the president had, dined one of the prominent Filipino, blacks nothing would have been said, ubout it. This nation is made up of, all colors, and all are free, and the, leaders of any of these races shouk1 be, allowed to consult the president, and It, Is but right that hashould extend them, such courtesies as he may think proper., The total consumption of sugar In, the United States last year was 2,219,, 847 tons, and based on the average in, crease of 0.34 per cent during tho past, nineteen years, the consumption this, year should be 2,360,585 tons, says the, Sugar Journal.

Notwithstand, ing tho many sensational reports which, have beon circulated during tho past, two weeks. That Col.

There are 1,689 definite, projects recorded, representing many, different stages of advancement, in the, interest of 1,038 companies. Of this, number 1,424 are tho projects of 853, companies within tho United States;, 230 are new lines and Improvements by, 158 companies In Canada, and 35 pro, jects In Mexico In tho Interest of 27, companies. In addition to new railway, construction an unusually largo num, ber of extensive Improvements are be, ing made by tho railroads. For ex, ample, final plans have been made for, nearly 1,300 steel or stone bridges and, trestles of large size, to take the place, of wooden structures., CHIME IN THE ARMY., General George B. Davis, judge ad, vocate general of the array, has sub, mitted to the secretary of war his an, nual report for the year ended Juno 30,, 1901. It shows that during the year, there were 6,065 trials by general court, martial, being 600 less than during the, previous year. Of these sixteen were, ti ials of commissioned officers, of whom, ten were convicted. Of the enlisted, men tried 4,800 wero regulars and 1,167, were volunteers. Tho report says that, the number of men sentenced to dis, honorable discharge in tho regular, army wus 1,895, and In tho volunteer, army 333, making a total of 2,228., Death sentences were Imposed by court, martial in six cases of enlisted men,, four of the cases being on conviction of, murder and two on conviction deser, tion. Tho deatli sentences, except in, one case of murder, wero commuted by, tho president to dishonorable dis, charge, forfeiture of all pay and allow, ances, and imprisonment at hard labor, for life in three cases, for seven years, in one case and for five years in another, case., The. record of military commissions, during tho year shows that 880 persons, wero tried, of which number 729 were, convicted and 202 acquitted. The sen, tences of 49 cases wero disapproved., Murder leads in the number of charges, before these commissions, numbering, 317. Violation of tho laws and usages, of war follow with 157 cases, while the, charge of robbery comes next with 106, cases., General Davis says that death sen, tences wero imposed by military com, missions in about 242 cases, nearly all, natives of the Philippine islands, on, conviction of more serious crimes, and, tho sentences wero executed in about, 101 cases.

Con, sequently tho load was reduced, and, leaving the steamer the crew started, with tho barge, propelling her with, tho capstan and line.
