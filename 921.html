President Hard\ning has hinted that there Is a shifting\nof views on prohibition and there are\nrumors that he himself will do some\nshifting on the bonus.\nAuthorized spokesmen for the pres\nident say he will veto any bill passet\nby congress dissimilar to the one pui\n*up to him earlier this year.

From questions au\nthe general attitude of the commli\nsioners it is believed they are favori\nble to the proposal.\nThe war department, which opei\nates the barge line,asked that the pre<\nent boundaries on southbound frelgh\nwhich now are the Ohio-Pennsylvani\nline on the east, and the Missouri ri1\ner on the west, be extended hot\nways, and that northbound rates b\nmade effective from points in Ters\nand Oklahoma on one side and Ah\nbama and Miaslppl points on the oti\ner.

Blrdsall\nIt Is estimated that the aggregate\nbanded indebtedness of the 82 coun\nties of Mississippi for roads and\nbridges up to Dec. 31. 1920, was $41,\n422.095.16, and that the total aggre\ngate indebtedness of all the counties\nin the state up to that time was $50,\n714,200.98. It is thought that the\nbonded Indebtedness since that date\n—for which there is no data to com\npile the facts—has increased to $60,\n000,000, and if this is true \'the total\naggregate bonded Indebtedness of the\n82 counties is $60,000,000. This la\nin addition to the bonded indebted\nness of the towns and eities of the\nstate and to the state bonded indebt\nedness which is said to be the great\nest since the state was admitted into\nthe Union. It appears that there is\nno law requiring the compilation of\nthe various indebtednesses of the\ncounties, municipalities and cities as\nin other states and the Legislature\nwill perhaps be called upon to pro\nvide for such legislation in the in\nterest of the taxpayer# ip order that\nthey may know how much they owe\nand for what. The abnj.-© Indebted\nness of the counties wii* doubtless\nprove an eye opener to the people.\nAll the Democratic norninees from\nUnited States senator down were\noverwhelmingly elected ac the No\nvember election, the It ©publicans\nand Socialist candidates receiving a\nvery meager vote, a Joint vote of per\nimyo teas umu xu pci vcui. x uc wu\ni stltutional amendment taking the\ntrunk highways out of the hands of\nthe boards of supervisors and plac\ning them under the control of the\nhighway department In order that\nMississippi may receive a million and\n- a quarter dollars annually from fed\neral appropriations carried’ by a good\nvote and will be Incorporated as a\npart of the constitution when the Leg\nislature convenes in January, 1924.\n’ The amendment to abolish the office\nof county treasurer was also adopt\ned, but by not as large a vote as the\nother amendment.\n1 \'Federal Judge Edwin Holmes de\nlivered a most drastic charge to the\ngrand jury at ine recent session of\nthe federal court of the southern dls\ni trict of Mississippi at Jackson on the\nviolation of the Volstead act. He\npointed out that it was a physical im\npossibility for the federal court un\n; aided by the state courts and state\n. officers to oope with the illicit dis\ntilling evil «nd showed tnat the state\ncourts had concurrent jurisdiction\nand that they had power to send vio\nlators jf the liquor laws to the peni\ntentiary for three years while the fed\nJ eral court only had jurisdiction to\nsend them to the penitentiary for six\n^ months. Judge Holmes invited a con\n\' ference of Mississippi judges and\n1 state officials for a co-operation tc\nsuppress the liquor evil. His charge\n* is being commended in the highest\nterms by tne press and the people\nare saying that he has pointed the\nway to a suppression of violation ol\ni both federal and state laws.\n* Sam Bagnell, the sheriff of Clai\nj borne County, possesses a uniqui\ntriplicate record.

At the same\ntime Chairman Lasker of the Ship\nping Board predicted that it would\nbe enacted Into law, because the “mi\nracle of America Is that at the final\nmoment of decision right and com\nmon sense will prevail."\nThe agreement for a vote was re\nported at a conference attended by\nSpeaker Olllett, Representative Mon\ndell, republican floor leader; Chair\nman Campbell of the rules commit\nlee, and members of the merchant\nlunuuc BUU IUU HlCClIUft cuuumuccn.\nThe leaders agreed that a rule should\nbe presented under which the bill\nwould be taken up for general de\nbate some time In the near future.\nThree days would be given over to\ngeneral discussion and then the\nmeasure would be taken up, item by\nItem, with three days for amend\nment, before a final vote.\nChairman Campbell said the agree\nment would eliminate the question\nof referring the measure to a party\nconference and would give the house\nthe opportunity to frame the sort of\nmerchant marine measure it wanted\nto pass. There was said to be vig\norous opposition in the republican\nranks to any attempt to give the bill\nright of way under a rule which\nwould prevent other than committee\namendments, and already, with the\namendments in oraer, indications\nwere that democrats, working joint\nly with republicans who oppose the\nbill, would endeavor to reimpose ex\ncess profits and surtaxes as a means\nof providing funds for ships. Demo\ncratic leaders predicted a flood of\namendments would be offered, includ\ning a provision sponsored by the dry\nelement, liquor on American ships.\nAnother point expected to result in\na fight will be any proposal under\nwhich foreign ships would be permit\nted to engage in coastwise trade.\nNotwithstanding signs of an im\npending fight in the house, the sen\nate is regarded as the most danger\nous point. No rule limiting debate\nis possible there, and a number of\nrepublican loaders have expressed\ndoubt whether the legislation can be\ndisposed of by March 3, when all bills\ndie with the end of the congress. The\ndemocrats already have declared sol\nidly against the measure and a large\nnumber of lepublicans, including Sen\nators Borah, Idaho; LaFollette, Wis\nconsin; Capper, Kansas, and others,\nI have made open declarations of war\n! against it. Senator Ransdell, Louis\n! iana, however, has spoken in its be\nhalf and tho administraion leaders\nare counting on a few more demo\ncratic votes if it is found possible to\nobtain a vote before adjourning.\nWILL REPRESENT AMERICA.\nJohn Bassett Moore Named on Inter\nnational Jurists’ Commission.\nWashington.—The State Depart\nment has announced ths appointment\nof John Bassett Moore aa the Amer\nican representative on the Interna\ntional commission of jurists to con\nsider changes In the rules of inter\n\' national law.

The Great Missionary\'s Field (vr.\n1-3).\nHe went throughout every city and\nvillage. The true missionary goes t®\neverybody, for all need the gospel.\n1. His Message (v. 1). He preached\nthe glad tidings of the kingdom of\nGod. The gospel message Is truly good\ntidings, for the great King Is offering\nto rebellious sinners salvation through\nJesus Christ.\n2. His Helpers (v. 1.) The twelvs\napostles were with Him. The mission\nary should utilize the help of others.\n3. Supported by Saved Women (▼▼.\n2. 3). Out of grateful hearts certain\nwomen who had experienced the sav\ning power of the gospel ministered\nunto Jesus of their substance.\nII. The Great Missionary Teaching\n(vv. 4-21).\n1. The Parable of the Sower (vv. 4*\n21.). (1) the sower—Jesus (see Matt.\n13:27). (2) The seed—the Word of\nGod (v. 11). (3) The kinds of ground\n(vv. 5-8). (a) Wayside (v. 5). This\nfoot-trodden path pictures the hard\nhearted upon which no Impression can\nbe made. The preached word finds no\nentrance, and Satan snatches It away\nas birds pick up the grain from the\nhard-beaten path. In such cases faith\ncannot spring up and result in salva\ntion (v. 12). (b) Stony ground (v. 6).\nThis Is not stones mixed with earth,\nbut a thin layer of earth on a ledge of\nrock. Tlie seed falling upon such\nearth springs up quickly, but the plant\nsoon dies when exposed to the sun.\nThis pictures the hearer who receives\nwith joy the message of the gospel, but\nwhen persecution and trials come be\ncause of following Christ he gives up\nand deserts the cause (v. 15). (e>\nThorny ground (v. 7). This ground is\ngood, but it has thorns growing in it.\nThe seeds Bpring up, but the plant has\nno room to develop. This pictures the\nChristians who bear no Christian fruit\nbecause of being preoccupied with\n“cares, riches and pleasures” of this\nlife (v. 14). (d) Good ground (v. 8).\nThe seed here sprang up and bore fruit\nto the full measure. This pictures the\nhonest heart which receives the gospel\nmessage and allows it to produce In\nits life u full harvest of grain (v. 15).\nThe application of this parable le\nfound in verses 16-18. #\n2. Kinship with Jesus Christ (w. 19\n21). Jesus teaches here that there is\na relationship to Him which is closer\nthan the tie of blood.\nIII. The Great Missionary Doing\nWonders (vv. 22-39).\n1. Calming the Storm (vv. 22-25).\n(1) Jesus asleep (v. 23). While the\ndisciples were sailing the ship the\nMaster fell asleep. (2) The fright\nened disciples (vv. 23, 24). As their\nships were filled with water the dis\nciples awoke Jesus with their cry of\nperil. (3) Jesus rebuked the wind unit\nwater (v. 24). At His word there was\na great calm, (4) Jesus rebuked the\ndisciples (v. 25). He did not rebuke\nthem for waking Him, but for their\nlack of faith.\n2.

Nothing thats\nwritten iu this issue is written by\nthe retiring editor except this artic\'e\nwhich will bo signed and som i locals\nand a death notice.\nA few days ago, Messrs (3 S Har\nmon and fioopokl Lueke of P. plar\nvilie dropped into mv office and pro\nottered to purchase The Herald. A\nprice was agreed on which satisfied\nme, and the closing out of the sale\nwas made Wednesday of this week\nand the new owners and editors are\nin charge and control.\nThe retiring editor has had his pol\nicies and we are not asham<3d of them\nand still hold to the same views—\nand they will have theirs, and are\nequally eutilled as I was, to detine\nand protect them as the occasion\ndoth arise.\nFor several years my friends out\nover the slate when I would bump\ninto them have said ‘‘Faulk why do\nyou stay in a little placo like Leakes\nville. A man of your talent and ex\nperience, can do much better in a\nbigger town.” I have refrained be\nfore of speaking of this, as well as\nsome good offers which have come to\nme to make changes. I have stayed\nby this situation for 24 years of con\ntinuous service and have built The\nHerald up to a place now where it\ndan enter successfully, if properly\nmanaged onto a new era of wider\nusefulness and prosperity, I leave\nit with some regrets but am selling\nat a time when there is a lull in pol\nitics, so that no man can say I had\nto sell, as with this month’s business\nit would huve paid entirely out of\ndebt and I had made some money\nbesides and leave owing no man a\ndollar that 1 know ol and am on good\nterms with even my enemies so far\nas 1 know and I admit I have made\nsome, but I have not intended to\ndo any man any wrong. I have said\nwhat 1 thought was for the best and\nsome have differed with me and in\nthe moments of cooler reflections I\nbelieve it has been shown that I\naveraged on being about as near\ncorrect as many times as« uthers,\nthough, I have made some mistakes\nas runs to the career of human kind.\nFor my friends and those who have\nstood by and patronised me during\nthe run of these years, I appreciate\nyou deeper than words can tell and\nshall remember you with a grateful\nheart. Some have spoken their re\ngrets at iny selling out wli eh is also\nappreciated.\nM.v newspaper property is being\nsold to responsible people. I would\nnot sell to any other kind. Mr Har\nmon is known to some of you from\nhaving held a meeting here several\nyears ago, and is known to others\nby reputation as a newspaper-man in\na similar cou- ty to Greene with the\nCutover pine land with subsequent\nfarming development problems to be\nwrestled with. Mr. Locke will get ac\nquainted with you as fast us possi\nble and will appreciate your cooper\nation and patronage as he will re\nmu\'D on the ground for the present\nai d the paper goes straight ahead\nwithout missing an issue. They are\ninstalling a linotype this week, which\nis a wise move, as the situation lias\ngrown to and is ripe for it and 1 had\nalready started negotiations to have\ninstalled one had 1 kept The Herald\ntill first, of the coming year.\nRemember triends it takes money\nto run a newspaper and be more lib\noral with my successors than possi\nbly some of you could have been with\nme, of which I am not complaining\nbut merely suggesting u more hearty\nborne patronage of busi aess for them.\nYou shall hear of me again. I am\n* newspaperman and where*er I go\nI shail expect to try to do sometning\nhowever little it may be to make\nsome easier the burdens of life to the\npoor stratas of society in this goodly\n}*od of ours. I as)’ it through no\nspirit ot boast, but as a matter of\nreminder at-a time like tins that I\nhave gone to the top in my state in\na newspaper organization way; have\ngone through the chairs and become\na past-President of the Mississippi\nPress Association, tp>d recently I\nreceived a national recognition,\nwithout any effort or solicitation and\neven without my kn.iwlodge, being\nelected state Vice-President for Mis\nsissippi for the National Editorial\nAssociation.

Harmon,\nLeopold Locke.\n■\n.\nPit Harrison to\nLead Democracy\nThat Senator Pat Harrison will\nbs the new leader of the Democratic\nminority in the Senate at the next\nsession of Congress is indicated by\nreports received from the national\ncapital last night.\nAlthough several other members\nhave been proposed to succeed Sen\nator Oscar Underwood, who has an\nnounced that he is physically unable\nto again undertake the work of\nleadership, sentiment in favor of\nSenator Pat Harrison is crystalizing\nrapidly, and in Washington it is\nregarded as practically certain that\nhe will be chosen if he cares to\naccept the honor.\nAs a matter of fact, Senator Har\nrison has been the minority leader\nfor the past eighteen months, al\nthough Senator Underwood has\nnominally worn the honor.\nIt has been Senator Harrison who\nbore the brunt of all the hard fight\ning on the floor of the Senate, and\nthe young Mississippian quickly es\ntablished himself as a master of\ndebate.\nWhen the hosts of Democracy\nwent down in overwhelming defeat\ntwo years ago there was mighty\nlittle courage left among the lead\ners. Senator Harrison was conspic\nuos among the few who kept right\non fighting, and the Republican ad\nministration had hardly taken the\n_:_r __in u._•___i\nup an incessant warfare, inspiring\nfighting blood in others, nagging the\nRepublicans, with the persistency\nof a gadfly, and his aggressiveness\nsoon brought about an organization\nof the party that resulted in the\nsplendid victory of last Tuesday.\n“Fighting Pat” is what they call\nhihi up at Washington these days.\nHe was not only a scrapper on the\nfloor of the Senate, but likewise on\nthe stump, and it was largely due\nto his splendid campaigning that\nDemocratic victories were won in\nseveral Northern and Western\nstates, notably Indiana and certain\nCongressional districts in Ohio.\nOthers mentioned for the minor\nity leadership are Robinson of Ark\nansas, Simmons of North Carolina,\nReed of Missouri and Key Pittman\nof Nevada.\nReed of course is not to be ser\niously considered, for none of the\nWilson Democrats in the Senate\nwould support him.\nRobinson could not gain the sup\nport of the formidable Underwood\nfollowing, for he vigorously op\nposed the Alabama Senator when\nthe latter was chosen for his pres\nent honor.\nPittman, of Nevada is a native\nMississippian, and a man of con\nsiderable ability, but it has never\nbeen manifested in the form of\nfloor strategy.\nFrom this it would appear that\nSenator Harrison has the inside\ntrac.k and it is up to him to say\nwhether he is willing to take up\nthe sword of Underwood and carry\non the fight.\nThe man chosen for the place\nwill necessarily have under guid\nance plans for the presidential\ncampaign of 1924, and many of the\nablest members of the Democratic\nparty believe that Harmon is pre\neminently the man for this. work.\nTHE GARDEN SPOT\nOF MISSISSIPPI\nFor years there has been rather a\nlow estimate placed upon what has\nbeen denominated “the sand beds and\nbarren pine lands” of South Mississ\nippi.\nIt is developing now that the cli\nmate and soil of this immediate sec\ntion of the State are capable of\nproducing almost everything to be\nhad anywhere else and particularly\nadapted to the growth and propaga\ntion of many things that cannot be\nproduced elsewhere.\nSatsumas, for instance. The very\niminating and informing article by\nMr. E. B. Ferris, Director of the\nSouth Mississippi Experiment Sta\ntion located here at Poplarville, clear\nly indicates that this fruit—one of\nthe most delicate and lucious in the\ncitrus family—can only be grown\nto an advantage in Pearl River and\na few adjoining counties.\nBesides the orchards mentioned by\nMr. Ferris, attention is directed to a\nfarms at Lucedale, in George County,\nnews item in the daily pape-s during\nthe past week of several car loads\nof Satsumas shipped from the Luce\nfarms in Lucedale, in George county,\na few miles below Poplarville, and\nat a price bringing wonderful re\nturns on the investment. It was\nfurther stated that yet other car\nloads were in process of preparation\nfor the market.\nIt is safe to affirm that \'forty or\nfifty acres of these cut-over pine\nlands set to Satsumas and properly\ncultivated and nurtured would in a\nfew years bring sufficient returns on\nthe investment to make the owner\nindependent financially. — Poplarville\nFree Press.\n■> I ■ _u..\nPEARL RIVER COUNTY CLIMATE\nAND SOIL PARTICULARLY\nADAPTED TO RAISING\nCITRUS FRUITS\n(By E. B. Ferris)\nThe experiment station in its\ntwo locations in Pearl River Counts\nhas tried almost every kind of crop\nthat we had reason to believe might\nsucceed under our soil and climate\nconditions. From present indications\nno one of these many crops give\ngreater promise for ultimate suc\ncess than does the Satsuma orange.\nIn the winter of 1U22 here were\n225 orange trees set out at Mc\nNeill. These included one dozen\ntrees each of seven different va\nrieties of round orange including\nthe Grape Fruit, and the balance\nwere Satsumas. At the end of two\nyears most of the round oranges\nhad died and were replaced with\nSatsumas. Since that time the\ndrawing in of this orchard for roads\nand other causes has reduced the\nnumber of trees to two hundred,\nmany of which are not first class\ntrees, due to having been replanted\nand to injury from several causes.\nAt the most critical period of\nthe existence of this orchard, or when\nthe trees were just beginning to\nbear well, the state gave up sta\ntion work at McNeill and the prop\nerty was turned over to the Bureau\nof Animal Industry, U. S. Depart\nment of Agriculture, for use as a\nlivestock experiment station.\nNaturally the interest of the new\nmanagement was chiefly in live\nstock and this orange orchard, not\nbeing fenced separately from the\nrest of the properly, the trees suf\nfered for a time from the depre\ndations of sheep and cattle and has\nlacked always the careful cultivation\nthat orange orchards in other sec\ntions have received. With the single\nexception, when the trees were spray\ned twice against white fly, this orch\nard has never been sprayed at all,\nyet the trees have continued to grow\nand bear fruit and this year, on\nground that has remained in sod and\nin many instances with weeds as\nhigh as the trees themselves, there\nwill be produced on a little less than\ntwo acres fully one thousand dol\nlars worth of fruit. Some of the\nlarger trees have more than one\nthousand oranges on them which\nwill sell readily at more than twen\nty dollars per tree and these best\ntrees are no better fruited, size\nconsidered, than are the smaller\ntrees in the orchard.\nIn our experience of thirty years\nas a scientific agricultural worker\nand a life time spent on a farm,\nwe have never seen any crop do\nso well with so little attention, not\neven peaches and apples before the\nday of San Jose scale and other\npests and plant diseases so com\nmon now with th3se and other com\nmon fruits.\nThe whole of Pearl River County\nis within the proven belt for Sat\nsuma production. At Lumberton,\non a parallel with the extreme north\nline of the county, Bass and Son\nhave long had a number of flour\nishing trees. At Poplarville, in the\ncenter of the county, Mr. J. J.\nScarborough has a number of Sat\nsuma trees that are marvels of per\nfection, and fully as good as any\ncitrus trees we have ever seen grow\nin Southern California or in the\nValley of the lower Rio Grande\niiuuf orownsviue, r%. amm,\ndistance fBom Mr. Scarborough’s\norchard is a smaller one on the\nhome place of Mrs. T. F. Smith,\nconsisting of, perhaps, thirty trees\nwhich are bearing an unusually\nheavy crop, and are as fine as any\nthrough this section. In an orchard\nnear the south line of the county\nbut actually in Hancock a single tree\nbare last year 3800 oranges and we\nare told this year has fully 4000.\nExperience in other parts of South\nMississippi, notably near Wiggins,\nwhere thousands of Satsumas were\nplanted some ten years ago and\nthe larger part succumbed to cold\nlater, goes to show that the location\nof the land with reference to air\ndrainage has more to do with suc\ncess or failure in orange production\nthan any other one thing. Oranges\nplanted on hills or hill sides sur\nvived the cold while those planted\nin the valleys succumbed to it. We\nknow that at Poplarville and McNeill\nthe oranges of Mr. Scarborough and\nof the Experiment Station were\nplanted on hills and hill sides and\nthat none of these trees were killed\nby the same freeze that destroyed\nso many at Wiggins and at other\nplaces south of us, nearer lake\nPontchartrain and the Gulf. This\nwould indicate that many of the\nhill lands of the county heretofore\nregarded as not the best farm\nlands, may finally prove to be our\nmost valuable assets when planted\nto Satsumas.\nPeople in other states and sec\ntions are giving much thought to\nthe possibilities of orange produc\ntion in our county. A year ago\nparties from Tennessee became in\nterested in a tract of land near\n/\n\\ Carriers and have already started\nI a large orange orchard; just rec\nently another party from Virginia\npurchased 1000 acres near McNeill\nsa8uB.ro Supuejd ui8aq jjr.w puB\nthis winter. We know of several\nparties who have been in the county\nrecently looking for locations and\nat the experiment station we re\ncieve frequently letters from people\n| in all parts of the country asking in\nformation along these lines.\nLet us not make the mistake so\noften of holding our lands at too\nhigh values when others want to\ncome among us. The original cost\nof the land is a small part of the\nfinal cost of developing a bearing\norchard. We have land here in the\ngreatest abundance and this should\nbe divided at a nominal price with\ninvestors who are willing to put\nmany times the value of the land\nin clearing, buildings, fences, trees,\netc., before they can ever hope for\nany returns. It would be better to\ngive bona fide investors of this\nkind small blocks of our land rather\nthan have them fail to come among\nfrom holding values too high.\nLegal Advertisements.\nBRIDGE CONTRACT NOTICE\nNotice Is hereby given that contract for\nthe building of a bridge ou Gr\'flln creek on\nstate Line and Kichtnn Road, will be let at\npublic outcry to tbe lowest responsible bidder\nthereof, aoeording to plan and specifications\non tile in the Clerks ofllee at the Iront door of\nthe courthouse, in the Town ol LeakesvIlJe,\nGreene County.

CLARK\nWashington.—On Armistice (lay, No\nvember 11, Clemenceau, "The Tiger”\nof France sailed from Uavre for the\nUnited States to present here the cause\nof the French tieople and, us It has\nbeen announced, to make clear the ex\nact position in « Inch the French And\nthemselves today.\nThis aged hut still stalwart Freneh\ninau will come to Washington and here\nwill meet the President, the secretary\nof stute, and others. It Is expected\nthat in private conversation ho will\nsay some things to the American offi\ncials which he will n»t say upon the\npublic platform.\nIt may be that the visitor will bring\nhis heaviest guns; to bear in what\nmay be called this private action. All\nof France Is not In sympathy with\nClemenceau\'s Intention to luy the cause ,\nbefore the American people, but Wash\nington hears that In a general way\nFrance hopes that some good may\ncome of 1L\nTho u’Hfer rtf this annnt turn monthH\nIn France during the summer that has\nJuSft passed. There seems to be some\nignorance today concerning the exact\ncondition of the countryside of France.\nAmericans generally do not seein to\nknow Just how much reconstruction\nwork hus been done nor do they seem\nto know just why It is that, as some\npeople have put it, the French are act\ning "contrariwise” on the subject of\ndisarmament and on some other mat\nters which have produced a little fric\ntion with the countries wh|£b were the\nallies of France in war.\nFrance Is Acting Humanly.\nSome American officials have visited\nFrance recently, and unquestionably\nthey have told their chiefs in Wash\nington Just what they have found in\nthe land of the sister republic. Every\nbody who makes the least study of con\nditions in France must find the same\nthing, and that is that whatever France\nhas done or is doing is prompted by\n\'the dictates of human nuture. Some\nof the things which the republic has\ndone and for which it has been criti\ncised probably would be done by any\nother country’ under like conditions.\nThe human nature equation is strong\na^ p factor in the whole problem.\nReconstruction and reclamation, as\nthey apply to France, may be said to\nbe different things. Reclamation has\nto do with the reclaiming of the fields,\ntheir retilling and their replanting with\ncrops. Reconstruction has to do with\nthe rebuilding of the farmhouses and\nthe thousands of hamlets, villages,\ntowns and cities which were de\nstroyed during the war.\nIt can be said that about nine-tenths\nof the agricultural acreage of France,\nwhich it was impossible to till during\nthe war because of military operations\nand of the destruction inflicted, have\nbeen reclaimed. During the season\nwhich has Just passed, France raised\nenough cereals to feed Itself, and\nFrance eats an enormous amount of\nureuuoiuiiB.\nReconstruction Is Slow.\nStories have been printed to the ef\nfect that reconstruction work In France\nwas going on rapidly. It Is going on,\nbut not rapidly. Village after village\nthrough which one pusses if he\nvisits the once embattled front are\nstill level with the plain. It would\ntake a long time to rebuild tbe de\nstroyed structures In France even if\nthe man power of the country was at\nthe pre-war mark. Moreover, building\nconstruction In France Is solid con\nstruction. The French build for all\ntime. The work necessarily would be\nBlow under any conditions. Today\nneither the man power nor the money\nto rebuild Is forthcoming, and there\nfore, except for temporary shelters, a\nconsiderable part of the population of\nnorthern France still is homeless and\nstill has no place In which to transact\nthe mercantile businesses of the coun\ntry.\nIt Is believed that Monsieur Clemen\nceau will set forth these conditions\nwhen he comes to the United States\nand will make them the basis of a\nstatement that the reason France Is\nso Insistent on Immediate reparation\nmoney Is that unless It Is paid quickly\nFrance cannot go on with Its building\noperations.\nFrance has Imported Into the coun\ntry a good many Italian, Spanish and\nSortuguese laborers. They are taking\nte place of the French youths who\nwere killed In the war. These men, of\ncourse, must be paid, and building ma\nterial must be paid for The French\ngovernment Is undertaking the pay\nments, but the money Is baaed on\ntbe promise of the reparations money,\nend If this Is not forthcoming there\nprobably will be something like finan\ncial cbaos in the European republic.\nThe whole thing; so far as the French\nviewpoint la concerned, la simple.\nSomebody has taken away what tbe\nft people bad end they Insist that tbe\nsomebody shall put It back and put !t\nback quickly.\nUnited States and League of Nation*\njfow that It baa become definitely\nhaewo that tbe United States Is to\nhave a voice In the nomination anti se\nlection of Judge* of the International\nCourt of Justice set up by the League\nof Nations, there is renewed Interest\nIn Washington In what ie said to he\nthe possibility thnt eventually this\ncountry will Join the league.\nThe most militant element In the\nDemocratic party clings to the belief\nthat ultimately the United States will\nenter the League of Nations and some\nof the Democrats seem to believe that\nthe present administration Is not as\nantagonistic to the thought of league\nmembership as once It was.\nThis feeling of (he Democrats Is not\nshared at all by the Republicans ex\ncept those In the party ranks with\nwhom the wish may be father to the\nthought and who. although maintain\ning their party standing, always have\nbeen more or less In favor of the pol\nicy of league membership.\nIt seems to the present writer, from\na somewhat careful study of the situ\nation, and from what can be leurned\nfrom administration leaders, that\nthere will be no closer approach to\nmembership In the league soon than\nthere Is at present, except as such\nan approach may be seen In the de\ntermination to enter the International\nCourt of Justice and to take part In\nthe great economic parley which may\nstraighten out the financial affairs of\nthe world.\nGuessing at Harding\'s Intention.\nThere are Republicans here who\nsay President Harding Is more ad\nvanced In his “international thinking’’\nthan are other powerful leaders in his\nparty. Again It may be said, how\never, that no one ever gets an expres-1\nslon from the administration which\nsmacks at all of a desire for league\nmembership, but It Is true that such\nwords as come from the administra\ntion leave the Impression that the\nX I r.\'IU"Ul WUUIU line IW a wuosu\narable-(flsrttnce Into the field of help\nfor the other peoples of the world,\nand that he probably Intends to make\nthis Journey afield If he can do It\nconsistently with the majority thought\nof his party.\nIt Is bootless, apparently, however,\nfor men and women who believe the j\nUnited States should enter the League |\nof Nations to think that during the\npresent administration of American\naffairs there will be any absolute join\ning up with the European nations In\nthe organization of the league as It\nexists today.\nIt Is held by the Republicans and\nantl-membership-in-the-league men gen\nerally that It still Is the intention\nof the United States to do what it\ncan unofficially to help matters in the\nworld, but that nothing will be done\nwhich from the point of view of the\nanti-leaguers would violate the Amer\nican traditions of aloofness from what\nfrequently are called foreign entan\nglements.\nConcerning Foreign Debts.\nIt has become known definitely\nwithin the last few days that so long\nns the present administration Is In\npower at least there will be no can\ncellation of tlie debts of the foreign\ners to the United States, but It also\nIs known thut. In spite of the cries\nhere and there about forcing payment,\nthe administration will attempt to do\nnothing with a strong hand to secure\nfor the United States the war debts\ndue it from abroad.\nAt the White House the other day\nan authorized spokesman for the Pres\nident said he had noticed here, there\nand everywhere that jnen were rising\nto say: “If these foreigners do not\npay us the money due, the United\nStates should get after them with a\nclub.’’\nThen the spokesman went on to say\nthat the President would give a re\nward to any man who would point out\ndefinitely the means of getting the\nforeigners to pay their debts, a means\nw hi oil vyould not Involve the sending\nof armies and navies to Europe, there\nto collect the money by force. It also\nwas intimated that some of the speak\ners were long on threats but short on\nnnjo uuu uit;uuo.\nOf course there Is general agree\nment that the United States cannot\ncollect Its debts by force. It now Is\nknown definitely that there will be\nrepresentatives of the United States\nIn a financial conference of the great\npowers of the world. Out of this con\nference there may come some means\nof adjusting finances so that the pres\nent conditions of threatened bank\nruptcy here and there may change\nand a slow return to financial sound\nness In European countries may be\nassured. When this condition Is\nreached Washington folk say that\nmeans will, be found to secure from\nthe foreigners the money which Is due\nto the United States.\nPublicity for British Cows.\nCo-operative advertising Is being\ntried In England for milk. The plan\ncalls for each dairyman and each dis\ntributer to contribute one-sixth of a\ncent a gallon .toward a fund which Is\nto be used to advertise the value of\nmilk as a food.\nOne of the arguments will be that\nthe dally consumption of milk per cap\nita In England, about a third of a pint.\nIs only a third of the consumption In\nthe United States.—The Nation’s Busi\nness.\nStriving to Bs Tactful.\n"When you type that letter,” re\nmarked Senator Sorghum, “be careful\nto misspell two or three of the longer\nwords."\n"Misspell tbemT" *\n"Yes.

Very frequently It Is the de\nsign In the fabric; again It 1s the regal\ncoloring, mixtures of gold, silver, steel\nand copper In fabrics which look as if\nthey had been hammered or wrought In\nmet.il and not woven on looms. In\ncrustations of Jewels, precious and\nseml-preclous, recall the flourishing\narts of this sumptuous period.\nExploits Seventeenth Century Stylet.\nAs a variation from the Renaissance\nthere Is the note of the pure Venetian\nstyles of the Seventeenth century.\nJeanne Lanvin uses this motif, there\nby ho’dlng persistently to her wide\nskirt effects. She has little support,\nhosvever, In this from other dressmak\nnro A nnAilnnilnnnnA n# tVi A olnnrlar\nsilhouette confirms the Insignificance\nof other eccentric period styles.\nRunning through all of the fashions\nIs the Oriental note, the Persian, the\nEgyptian, the Chinese, the Japanese,\nsometimes In Its pure form, and again\nIh the cleverly modernized Interpre\ntation. •\nMagnificent embroideries, hand quilt\nings, headings. Incrustations, ham\nmered, pressed and printed fabrics all\nhave significant showing. France,\nfrom the standpoint of novelty mate\nrials and trimmings, Is coming bnck\nInto her own. Not since the several\npropitious seasons Immediately pre\nceding the war has France produced\nso many wonderful novelties. This\nelaboration of tissues, whether It be\nIn weave or applied after the work of\nthe looms, will add greatly to the cost\nof fashionable clothes.\nSleeve Details Vary Silhouette.\nDetails of sleeves have changed con\nsiderably, and It Is In this point that\nthe silhouette of 1922-28 will express\nItself largely. New sleeves are often\nfull length and may be large at the\nwrist, elbow or throughout their full\nlength. Long mitten-shaped sleeves\nare also much used. Many new forms\nIn puffed effects are seen. Sometimes\nthis puff breaks at the elbow; again It\nIs at the wrist. Sometimes a succes\nsion of flnre ruffles are placed at the\nelbow or on the wrist of a tight-fitting\nsleeve.\nMany fancy sleeves are seen on eve\nning dresses. Frequently they start\nfrom the elbow downward, and they\nare even attached at the wrist, cover\ning the hands with deep circular frills.\n\' $ ^ I\nThe Charming 8treet Dresa Developed\nin Imitation Broadtail and Black\nBroadcloth.\nAll these new sleeve effects are prac\ntically taken from the Renaissance\nperiod, court dress style. The sleeve\nless Idea still exists, bn* lg not so new\nas these other more fanciful forms.\nThe waistline Is a variable point, bnt\na big percentage of models continues\nto be In low waistline style, many of\nwhich blouse In the back. There Is\nstill every degree of low waistline,\nfrom that which starts below the nor\nmal waistline to well down to below\nthe turn of the hips, In distinct Egyp\ntian and Oriental, form.\nOne-Side Drapery.\nThe length of skirts Is still variable,\nbnt the consensus of opinion Is that\nthe street skirt will be nine to ten\nInches from the ground. More dressy\nafternoon toilettes will be four to five\ninches from the ground. Eccentric\nperiod styles, both In crinoline and\nRenaissance effect, often touch and\ntrail. So many of the best makers\nshow such a predominance of the\nshorter lengths—that is, from nine to\nten Inches above the floor—that one\nmight expect this to be the smartest\nlength. Other variations will be more\nor iess a personal and Individual\nthing.\nSurprising ns It mny seem, the skirt\nremains narrow, often extremely nar\nrow. Fullness, when Introduced, Is un\nI -\nThree-Piece Suit; Dress of Gray\nCloth; Jacket of Dark-Red Cloth,\nBrocaded in Gray..\nsbtruslve, and Is usually achieved by\nmeans of the circular cut. There Is\ness unevenness about the hem, many\n>f the skirts being straight around.\nThe one-sided drapery Is a strong\nfeature even In the plainest tailored\nIresses and coats; also the one-side\nfastening nnd wide, overlapping front,\nl’hls overlapping one-side effect Is also\nmuch noted In skirts.\nThe Three-Piece Suit.\nTailored suits are very pronounced\nin the showing of both two and three\nalece effects. A great majority of the\nlackets are waist length and In\nstraight, unbelted or slightly blousing\nind belted styles. The exceptions are\nincidental novelties In very short box\nSolero rtyles, Chinese mandarin full\nswinging coats and three-quarter\nlength circular-cut effects, the latter\nusually trimmed with fur.\nThe three-piece idea is prominent.\nIt expresses itself In two forms—the\nsmart one-piece wool dress with match\ning Jacket or the crepe de chine or\nsatin dress with a wool coat entirely\ncovering It, the lining of which Is\nmade of the same material as the\ndress.\nAfternoon dresses are much more\nelaborate than they were last season.\nThey are often made of beautiful nov\nelty materials; or If they are In plain\nmaterials they are richly embroidered,\nappllqued nnd beaded. They are In\ndecided contrast to the very simple\nhand-made crepes which have been so\ngreatly In vogue.\nEvening dresses are much less\ndecollete than In former yenrs. Many\nof them are made with a slightly\nrounding or bateau neck. Some of the\nevening dresses have full-length\nsleeves, and it Is only the very cere\nmonious type that Is extremely decol\nlete and sleeveless.\nDraped Evening Dresses.\nConsiderable moire Is used, notably\nIn evening dresses, the moire often\nhaving a high luster satin back, mak\ning It possible to use In drapery where\nboth sides of the material Is allowed\nto show.\nIn crepe weaves marocain continues\nstrong, replacing to no small degree\ncrepe de chine. There is, however, a\nnew quality of silk crepe called crepe\nmongol which Is being used quite ex-,\nteuslv^y. Crepe georgette and crepe\nromalff are used for beaded dresses,\nof which there are still a great many.\nGeorgette and sheer crepe romaln are\nalso used In combination.\nMany pile fabrics in wools are being\nshown, notably in thick cord weaves\nand walflellke checks, sheared to give\na velvet pile surface. These are lu\nsolid colors and also In mlxturea of\ntwo and three tones. ▲ very beauti\nful line of this character, brought out\nby Rodler, has a mixture of wool and\nartificial silk which gives a sort of\nfrosty look.\nRodler often uses a metallic color\nIn the artificial silk which he uses to\nIlluminate the duller woolen threada\nIn shades of brown and beige he uses\nflecks of gold and copper-colored silk;\nIn blues and gray he uses sliver and\nsteel-tone silk. Thus even these wool\nens have a metallic glitter.\nudania\nand Isinidj#\nChanak, on tho* Dardanallaa.\n(Prvpved by the National Geographic So\nciety, Washington, D. C.)\nThree towns of Asia Minor, seldom\nheard of In ordlnury times, have stood\nout In the world news of recent weeks\n—Chanak, Mudaula and Israld. Mere\nvillages normally, each has had sud\ndenly poured Into it soldiers or celebri\nties, and has taken on, briefly at least,\nImportance greater than that of many\na metropolis.\nChanak, the strategic point on the\nAsiatic side of the Dardanelles, which\nfigured for weeks as a sort of threat\nened British Thermopylae, Illustrates\nhow translation may spoil romance.\nThe name means “pots”—scullery\nware. But though It has a hum-drum\nname, Chanak—or Tehanak-Kulessl—\nand Its neighborhood have more than\nonce been the stnge for acts which\nhave radically modeled the world’s his\ntory and even the world\'s literature.\nBarely twenty miles to the south rose\nTroy, to furnish inspiration alike t®\nHomer and his myriad of readers.\nWithin a stone’s throw of Chanak,\nXerxes In 480 B. C. led his thousands\nof Persians across the Dardanelles on\n£ bridge of boats In the first formidable\nexpedition of Asiatics Into Europe\nwhich history records. At the same\nspot a century and a half later Alex\nander led his smaller but more highly\ntrained army Into Asia on his trium\nphal conquest of the world.\nIt was from Chanab In 1353 that the\nTurks crossed to their first foothold In\nEurope—a crossing that gave Europe\na problem that has bred wars and\nmassacres and broken treaties for\nmore than five hundred years.\nThe Sea of Mnrmora Into which the\nDardanelles and the Bosporous widen\nforms a barrier between Asia and Eu\nrope. The roads between the two con\ntinents lie ncross the two straits at\nIts ends. Constantinople at the nar\nrowest point of the Bosporous, Is the\nfront door; Chanak, where the Darda\nnelles Is most constricted. Is the back\ndoor. It Is natural enough, perhaps,\nthat almost all of the historic Inva\nsions of Kurone from the East should\nhave been by the back way, and that\nthere again today Great Britain should\nhave made an Important stand.\nCastle after castle, each fortified,\ncomes Into view on both the Asiatic\nand the European sides of the Darda\nnelles as one steams from the\nAegean toward Constantinople. But\nthe narrows opposite Chanak are re\nserved for the castles of castles; the\ncastle of Asia on the right, the castle\nof Europe on the left. The Chanak\nfortifications were first constructed In\n1470, not long after Constantinople fell\nto the Turks. Ever since Chanak has\nbeen a place of Importance. In recent\ndecades It has been the point of admin\nistration for all the Dardanelles de\nfenses—the solar plexus of the outer\nstraits. German artillery experts re\nsided there during the World war and\ni modernized the fortifications.\nMudania Something of a Seaport.\nWhile Chanak Is a channel port,\nMudania, scene of the Near East mil\nitary parley, Is a full-fledged seaport—\non paper at least. It is, however, on\nwhat Is now the quiet little Sea of\nMarmora, though It was once the cen\ntral body of water of the civilized\nworld. Inconspicuous as It Is, Mu\ndania, scene of the Near East peace\nparley, was far from being unfrequent\ned before the World war began. In\nthose days its visitors went through\nMudania on the boat-and-rall trip from\nConstantinople to Brusa. The Turks\nprohably chose Brusa’s port for their\nconference with allied representatives\nbecause Mudania Is the nearest town,\nIn the neutral zone of the Straits ter\nritory, to this their chief Asia Minor\ncity, which lies Just across the line\nwhere the Turk rule Is absolute.\nWhen the Marmora was yet an In\nland Turkish sea the boat from Con\nstantinople to Mudania was apt to be\nlate and crowded, and many travelers\ncomplained of petty exactions from\nporters and customs officials. Petty\nannoyances, though, cannot wholly\nmar a trip across the Marmora, and\nthe western traveler who views the\nAsiatic coast line of\'this placid lake\nfor the first time has a sight of rare\nbeauty and probably a surprise. Oapes\nand Islands, hays and forested shores,\nmake the approach to almost any point\nbetween Chanak and Ismld a scene of\nbeanty. And the mld-dty of the South\nMarmora shora, Mudania. la no ex\nMptlMk\nUpon landing, the Illusion of a\nquaint and pretty town, nestling\namong hillside panels of olive groves,\nmulberry trees and vineyards. Is die\npelled. After one look at the ditches\nthat do for streets, the passenger usu\nally was willing to take the earliest\nconveyance for Brusa, some fifteen\nmiles to the southeast.\nThis railway, built In the early nine\nties, used to be cited ns an exnmple of\nthe Turk\'s Inaptitude for engineering\nprojects. After the line was built at\nextravagant cost the Turkish govern\nment bought locomotives not adapted\nto the tracks and grades, and locked\nthem up for some yenrs while the new\nlaid rails rusted, and the wagon road\nto Brusa was In almost lmpassabls\ncondition.\nIf the railway ran beyond Brusa,\nMudanla might enjoy greater prosper\nity, as the port of one of the richest\nagricultural regions of Asia Minor. In\nstead Panderma, to the west, as the\nterminus of the railroad to Smyrna,\ncompletely eclipses Mudanla, with only\nIts short line to Brusa. Counting some\nfour thousand Greeks, Mudanla\'s nor\nmal population was only six thousand.\nThe Greeks, of course, have departed,\nbut many Turks have clustered there\nIn recent months. »\nIsmid Rich in History.\nIsmid, at the northeastern corner ol\nthe Sea of Marmora and at the base ol\nthe peninsula that extends to the Bos\nporus, Is the point at which the Turk\nish nationalists made one of theli\nheaviest troop concentrations In the\nlatter .days of the Mudanla purley.\nIsmld\'s once Important harbor li\nnow silted and Its population Is barely\ntwenty thousund. But before Constan\ntinople was enlarged by Constantine\nthe Great, Ismid, then Nlcomedla, was\nfor a time the capital of the Itomar,\nempire and the metropolis of the Near\nEast.\nSituated at the head of the Gulf ol\nIsmid, which forms the sharp Asiatic\nend of the Sea of Marmora, and with\nhigh ground behind it, the town lay in\nthe route of the natural highway from\nSyria, Persia, Mesopotamia and the\ncuiuo ut j.juoi. ivr tuv iyvujn/1 uo »»“\nEurope. Iu the old days camel cara\nvans Innumerable carrying the riches\nof the East plodded around the end of\nthe gulf, paused to pay commercial\ntribute to the strategically situated\ncity, and continued west along the low\ncoast of the gulf for the fifty miles\nthat separated Nlcomedia from Byzan\ntium and now separate Ismld from\nConstantinople. And when the steel\nhighway and Iron horde that were to\nconnect Berlin and Bagdad came to re\nplace the more picturesque but less\nefficient camel and his dusfty road, the\nsame natural path was utilized and\nIsmld became a railway station.\nDarius and his hosts swarmed\nthrough the site of the present Ismld,\nfive hundred years before Christ, to\nbridge the Bosporus and conquer\nThrace and Macedonia. Xenophon\nand bis ten thousand Greeks passed\nthrough the place In their memorable\nretreat from Persia to their homes.\nNear there the defeated Hannibal, a\nrefugee from the Romans, committed\nsuicide; and in a villa close by Con\nstantine the Great died. Force after\nforce of Crusaders held the town dur\ning the Middle ages.\nFrom Nlcomedia Diocletian direct\ned his implacable campaign of perse\ncution against the Christians and later\nthe lint Christian emperor, Constan\ntine, governed from Its palaces. Bare\nly twenty miles to the south at Ntcea\nthe church council framed the Nlcene\ncreed; and only a short distance to\nthe west on the Ismld peninsula In 451\nA. D. was held the ecclesiastical as\nsembly from which the Armenians\nbolted to form the. separate Armenian\nchurch, which, with the Roman Cath\nolic and the Protestant churches helps\nmake up the four major divisions of\nChristianity.\nThe Ismld of today has little to re\nmind the observer of Its glorious his\ntory. An old Greek acropolis flanked\nby Roman and Byzantine towers is\nabout the only remaining link with its\nopulent past The iron-and-wood can\navans of the Bagdad railway do not\nneed to pause In Ismld as did the camel\ntrains, and Its toll from commerce has\ndwindled away. To It the world no\nlonger looks either for creeds or ths\ntreasures of Arsby—only for a modest\nsupply of silk cocoons, tobacco, and\nforest products.\n1 1 —\n| GOOD\nI HIGHWAYS\nVARIOUS TY PES OF HIGHWAYS\n8eriea of Motion Picture Film* Illus\ntrate Practice in Construction\nof Road*.\n- • I\n(Prepared by the United state* Department\nof Agriculture.)\nA series of one-reel motion-picture\nfilms illustrating modern practice In\nthe construction of the various types of\nhighways has been prepared under the\ndirection of the bureau of public roads\nand are now available for free distri\nbution by the motion picture section\nof the United States Department of\nAgriculture.\nThe films, consisting of one reel\neach, are as follows: "Modern Con\ncrete Road Construction"; "Building\nBituminous Roads”; “Mixed Asphalt\nPavements”; "Brick From Clay t®\nPavement”; “Granite Block Paving";\n“High Roads and Sky Roods." i\n, In addition there will be completed\nIn a short time “Building Forest\nRoads” and "Around the West by For\nAn improved Forest Road In Colorado.\nest Roads.” A film on gravel-road con\nstruction Is In course of preparation.\nThese films are Intended for use In\nengineering colleges, road meetings,\nand other public gatherings.

The road Is laid\ndown In the shai>e of a race track and\nIs cojuitructed of 13 sections, each one\nof a different type of concrete pave\nment. The problem Is to find out\nwhich will last longest. A procession\nof some 40 motor trucks, loaned by the\nUnited States government, travels con\ntinuously over Its surface. There are\ntunnels underneath and ditches along\ntile sides from which observations of\nthe effect of traffic on the different\nsections are being made. Sections that\nweur out first are to be restored and\nkept in repair until the stoutest sec\ntion, whichever It may prove to be, has\nbeen destroyed. The cost of building\nand wearing out the road, which Is be\ning defrayed In part by contributions\nof men, machinery and material by the\nroad building Interests, probably will\nrun into hundreds of thousands of dol\nlars. It Is hoped, however, that the\npractical Information thus obtained\nwill more than offset Its cost.\nTRANSPORT PRIMER PRAISED\nBook Prepared by Educational Com\nmittee to Be Translated for\nUse of High Schools.\nPrompted by the success of the edu\ncational outline on highway transport\nprepared for university use under\ntheir direction by Prof. Lewis McIn\ntyre, the officials of the highway and\nhighway transport education commit\ntee h»ve now turned to Professor\nBuckner of the school of education of\nthe University of Pittsburgh to trans\nlate the book Into language designed\nfor use by high school students\nthroughout the country.\nThe new pamphlet will be prepared\nIn co-operation with official* of the .\nUnited States bureau of public roads,\nthe United States bureau of education\nand other organizations represented\non the committee, and will be the first\ncomprehensive effort to place the sub\nject of highway transport before the\nhigh school students of the country.\nTexas Leads In Road Making.\nTexas Is leading all other states In\nthe construction of federal-aid high\nways.
