A\'s Key\nWesters generally know. Key West had its\nlast hurricane in 1919, 23 years ago, and the\nimmediately, preceding one occurred in\n1910, 32 jegiris ago.\nNew York has one doctor for each 65t>\ninhabitantsf;&ere should be a doctor for\nevery \'Key West, a city of 30,000\npeople hjuu|l>ree practicing doctors at the\npresent Averaging one doctor to each\n10,000 That condition is all\nout of ptH&drUon and a danger to this com\nmunity. West & a Very health\nful c ity. ot so healthful Hint this pau\ncity of doctor* fs not a mensc* to the public\nhealth.\nJUST another subterfuge\nEvery fair-minded Key Wester —The\nCitizen thinks it is unnecessary to say hon\nest —is solidly behind City Councilman\nWilliam A. Freeman in his refusal to sign\ncity warrants that include boosts of the sal\naries of five city officials through the “spe\ncial relief accounts” that a majority of the\ncouncilman have tried to create.\nAnd imagine City Attorney Thomas\nCaro’s asserting that this particular ordi\nnance, giving five officials amounts in ex\ncess of the salaries set for them by law,\n“Piovides for an emergency which actual\nly exists and provides for relief of these of\nficials caused by this emergency ...”\nYes, yes, Mr. Caro, in what dire straits\nare the five city officials! Poor fellows,\nthey are so badly up against it they don’t\nknow where they’ll get the amount for an\nother sandwich!\nTake Mayor Willard Ajlbury, who tops\nthe “emergency” list for “relief”. He has\nonly three jobs. Besides the stipend he gets\nfrom the city, he receives salaries regular\nly from two other sources.\nAnother object of “relief” is Fire Chief\nLeroy Torres. Poor Leroy, he must be re\nduced to living on bread and coffee. Just\nthink of it, all he gets to keep the coffee\npouring is two salaries, one from die city\nand one from the county. Y\'es, we should\npass the hat for our friend\nAnd now we come to our captain of\npolice, Alberto Camero, who looks like a\nhandsome lieutenant; Ivan Elwood, who\nlooks as trim and wellfed as a brigadier\ngeneral at least, while Joe Kemp looks as\ndapper as any fullfledged general Uncle\nSam can produce.\nAsk these three police officers, Mr.\nCaro, if they need “relief”!\nThe Citizen is not criticizing these\nlive men. So far as it knows, not one of\nthem has been urging the payment of this\n“relief” money. The blame for the “emer\ngency” and the “relief account” rests en\ntirely on a majority of the city council that\nseems determined to give away taxpayers’\nmoney.\nYes, Mr. Caro, the ordinance in ques\ntion “piovides for an emergency which ac\ntually exists and provides for relief for these\nofficials,” but let all of us honest Key West\ners applaud Councilman Freeman for re\nfusing to give away the city’s money under\nthe guise of “relief” to men who are not in\nneed of relief.\nFinally, this latest move by the council\nin this matter is only another subterfuge.\nMACARTHUR AND THE SOLOMONS\nThere has been much loose talk about\nthe campaign in the Solomon Islands, with\nsome newspaper correspondents going so\nfar as to suggest that the division of the\nSouth Pacific ocean into two zones was\ndone to prevent General MacArthur from\ncommanding the proceedings.\nThe American general has denied ihe\nstory. The United States News points out\nthat the area was divided in Washington,\nwithout reference to the President, and chat\n“It was concurred in by General MacAr\nthur.”\nThis ought to dispose of the particular\nyarn. There is another one, going around\nthe circle, to the effect that there is not che\nproper cooperation between the Naval com\nmand and General MacArthur, that the at\ntack upon Guadalcanal was launched as a\n“navy show” and that our soldiers were l&ft\nout of the campaign in order that the Navy\nmight grab the glory.\nWhat about this one? Well, the United\nNews reports that there w r as consideration\nof a land offensive from Australia aimed at\nNew Guinea and New Britain, but that lack\nof shipping and the long supply line involv\ned caused the high command to veto che\nplan. It adds that “the situation was ex\nplained and General MacArthur concurred\nwhen the action was taken.”\nThe Solomon Islands operation was a\nnaval operation and had to be under com\nmand of a naval officer. The plan was for\nthe Marines to seize the area, after which\nthe AVlny would move in. There has been\ndelay in moving an adequate number of\nsoldiers because of the lack of adequate\nsea control but “there is closest coopera\ntion between General MaeAYthur’s air\nforces and naval air forces.\nIncidentally, the attack upon Guadal\ncanal was launched .upon the decision of\nAdmiral Leahy, Admiral King and General\nMarshall and the United News frays the\n, “Army pressed harder than did the Navy\nfor this particular operation.”\nTHE KEY WEST CITIZEN\nt\'OTTO FOR AMERICA\nKEY WEST IN\nDAYS GONE BY\nFROM FILES OF THE CITIZEN\nof NOVEMBER 11. 1932\n•~"T~i77ii " ■■■■ rr\nEnoch Baker, familiar figure\non Key West streets, suffered a j\nicut on the back of his head this 1\nmorning when he fell on the brick j\npavement near the corner of J\nElizabeth and Division streets, j\nJudge Jefferson B.

He has fired passes for\nfive of Notre Dame’s thirteen\ntouchdowns before Navy came\nalong. His biggest day was\n> against Stanford when all four\nof Notre Dame’s scores came on\nhis passes.\nSets Up Most Touchdowns\nA majority of the South Bend\nteam’s other scores were set up\nby Bert’s tosses, with someone\nrunning for the last few yards.\nFurthermore, he has scored once\nhimself and kicked eleven extra\npoints. With Bert handling the\nball on almost every play the\nopposition doesn’t know what to\ndo. If they come in close Angelo\nwill prss ’em dizzy and if they\nopen up a bit to guard against\nthe aerial barrage other Notie\nDame backs punch holes through\nthe weakened close-up defense.\nBertelli is only fair as a run\nner or kicker but how’ that boy\ncan pass. His passes permitted\nNotre Dame to go through last\nsywson unbeaten. But Coach\nLcahv knew he couldn’t\n* expect thrt luck to hold another\nyear. Everyone would be setting\nup special defense against his\npasses.\nDeceoion Needed\nLeahy decided the Irish would\nneed moie deception.

Boree had a wide edge up\nto that time but the air station\nlad proved he could take plenty\n. of punishment.\nThe second match sent Gosden\nagrinst Marine Walter Clewis of\nMiami. The Marine had a slight\nedge in the first frame, Cosden i\ngoing down for no count, but the\nlccal lad rallied in the second to\nstagger Clewis with terrific body\npunching. The third was fatal\nfor the Key Wester, however,\nI when the Miamian opened a bad\n■ cut over his right eye. The bout\n; was stopped with a TKO for\nI Clewis.\nThe long-awaited return match\n: of Len Fielding and Steve Earn\ner went the full distance of four\n| settos and was close and exciting\nall the way with Earner gaining\nj a well-deserved nod. The first\nround was about even with Earn\ner taking a shade, if any.\nI Fielding hit his stride in the sec\nond to out-point his opponent\nj with his potent left but faded\nterrifically in the third and last\ni frames to give Earner a wide\n! margin.\nAfter the Secreet-Nottlow main\nevent, Frank Lehn and Bob Whit\n! ney met in a return go. The\ni first setto was close with Lehn\n• scoring the most damage. Whit\nj ney was willing to continue mix\n; ing things up in the second but\nLehn again proved he could dish\n: out plenty of punishment. The\nthird revealed the beginning of\nthe end because Whitney went\ndown for an eight count. The\ncurtains finally dropped after 50\nj seconds of the fourth when Lehn\n\' was awarded a TKO. Whitney\nbeing on his knees and unable to\n; defend himself against Lehn’s\nfurious onslaught,\nj Bout No. 6 brought together\n1 Red Cameron, a Miami favorite,\njand Melton Lambert.

He not only has j\nwon—this fall he is playing the\nengagements he was forced to.\ncancel last winter, and his play-1\ning satisfies him as well as it\ncould.\nThis means he feels he is do- j\ning his best. “An artist,” he ex\nplained the other day in his first\ninterview since he was struck\nby a truck on April 26 of last\nyear, “is always humble. He is\nnever satisfied. His music is a,\nkind of sanctuary, a refuge and j\na strength. But he never plays!\nas well as he would like.”\nThe great violinist was by far {\nthe most vigorous spirit in the!\nrestful, wood-paneled office of!\nhis long-time friend and mana- j\nger, Charles Foley. His gestures,\nwere strong, and his face was. j\nas always, mobile and expres-\'\nsive.\n“My accident took my sight,”;\nhe says, “and my hearing. I could\'\nnot move and I was bandaged]\nand useless. But mv music was ;\nstill there, waiting.”\n“There.” was ip his head, and\nhe tapped the head to illustrate.;\nHe did not find * it difficult\'\nwhen he started playing again—;\nquite the opposite.

We clean\nup anyway on a five-game parlay,\nbut if the State-Michigan game\nhappens by some small\nwind up a tie we make a terrific\nkilling.

The recital was arranged\nby Mrs. Riba Sawyer, under the\nauspices of the Women’s Guild, j\nand judging by the members of\nthose who turned out for the oc\ncasion,—and by their subsequent\nenthusiastic comments, —this sort\nof music should be heard more\noften in Key West.\nThe Navy was well represented,\nboth on the program and in the\naudience. Mrs. E. J. Quinby (wife\nof Lieut. Quinby, USNR) played\ncompositions of Bach, Saint-\nSaens and Guilmant. Stanley\nPlummer, Sp. 3c, USNR, played\ncompositions of Grieg, Boellman\nand Bach. Mrs. Helen Hoglin,\npopular receptionist of the Jack\nson Sq. USO, sang “The Lord Is\nMJy Shepherd”. There were sev\neral officers and men in\' Navy\nuniforms throughout the audi\nence.\nCharles Roberts, regular organ\nist of St. Paul’s, not only played\ncompositions of Handel, Nevin\nand Sir Arthur Sullivan, but he\nalso accompanied the vocal num\nbers of Miss Mary Ann Matchett\nand Mrs. Hoglin.\nThe program was designed to\nsatisfy a variety of musical tastes,\nranging from sacred music\nthrough heavied classics and in\ncluding some of the lighter semi\nclassical selections familiar to all.\nAt the close of the recital, the audi\nence had an opportunity to con\ntribute their own vocal talents\nto the program by singing the\ntimely “America” to the accom\npaniment of Key West’s biggest\npipe-organ. Father Arthur B.\nDimmick delivered his benedic\ntion.\nThe program which was ren\ndered was published in The Citi\nzen on Monday.\nWANT TO ENLIST?\nBy JACK STINNETT\nAP Feature Service Writer\nWASHINGTON, Nov. 11.—So\nyou want to enlist.\nWell, Mister, don’t put it off\ntoo long. Voluntary enlistments\nmay be closed any day. As the\nmanpower problem becomes\nmore acute, need for absolute\ncontrol of channeling manpower\ninto the armed forces and pro\nduction will force powers\nthat be to disregard a man’s\nlikes and dislikes and put him\nwhere they think he is most\nneeded.\nEven if that time should never\ncome, Johnny-come-earlies are\nskimming the cream off some\nbranches of the services.
