If gin weights are too much,\nthen too much is charged for thé gin\nning. If compress weights arc too\nlow, then these should be promptly\nand effectively regulated, as cotton is\nscarce this year, and the average\nwhite farmer can ill afford to lose\nfive pounds to the bale, with cotton\nat 22 cents a pound.

The\nforegoing part of this article meets\nheartily with my approval, and con\ntains statements that are worthy of\nthe most careful consideration of the\npublic. This article dwells upon the\nconduct and life of officials while in\nthe discharge of their duties, and\nwhen the public has elected and de\nclared one to be their public servant,\nand this public servant has discharg\ned his official duties well, amicable,\nand honorable, then it devolves upon\nthe public to offer words of praise\nand comfort unto him when the hour\nof peril and despondency has arrived.\n1 desire to state there is no man or\nwoman in this great commonwealth\nof ours who is more ready to offer\nwords of praise and condolence to he\nwho is a servant of the people than I.\nWhen the officials of our county have\nperformed their respective duties, and\nthese duties have functioned to the\nIllinois Central System Tells About\nShortage of Transportation\nWe are now in one of those periods when the business of the country, including agriculture, suffers\nsevere losses by reason of the shortage of railway transportation—the inability of the railroads to move\npromptly all of the traffic awaiting shipment.\nThe Illinois Central System is leaving nothing undone in its efforts to meet the situation. In our\nOctober statement we showed that we have this year added to our rolling equipment new cars and loco\nmotives costing a total of more than $14,000,000. These purchases included sixty-five locomotives. Since\nthat statement was published we have purchased, in addition, seventy-five large freight locomotives,\nmaking a total of. 140 locomotives purchased this year. However, we are handling the largest traffic in\npatrons doubtless will continue to be inconvenienced by the general\nthe history of this system, and our\nshortage of transportation facilities.\nThe miners\' strike, which continued for nearly five months, and the railways shopmen s strike have\nnaturally had an effect upon the present shortage of transportation, but the main cause goes far deepei\nthan those strikes.\nWhat is commonly called the "car shortage" is in reality a shortage of all kinds of railway facilities,\nincluding locomotives, freight cars, passing tracks, terminal facilities, etc. For a number of years the rate\nat which the railroads have been able to increase their facilities has gradually fallen off, while the ton\nmileage hauled, which represents the public demand fox transportation, has been gaining steadily.\nIn the even years ended with 1907 the number of locomotives increased 2,800 a year, and the number\n°f freight ears 90,000 a year. In the next seven years the number of locomotives increased only 1,500\na year, and the number of freight cars only 50,000 a year. In the seven years ended with 1921 the num\nber of locomotives increased only 276 a year, and the freight ears only 6,000 a year. The increase in the\nnumber of locomotives in the seven years ended with 1921 wa3 only one-ninth as great as in the\nseven years ended with 1907, while the increase in the number of freight cars was only one-fifteenth as\ngreat. The decline in the amount and capacity of the equipment provided has been accompanied by a\ncorresponding decline in other facilities. This condition cannot continue without causing frequently re\ncurring losses of a serious nature to the county.\nDuring periods of business depression, when there is a surplus of transportation, the railroads should\nbe most active in enlarging and extending their facilities for future needs, but that has not been passible\nin the past because business depressions have been accompanied by widespread demands for reduced\nrates.

MARKHAM,\nPresident, Illinois Central System.\n.\n7» -\nbetterment of our people, then I shall\nstand by their side, offer assistance\nwhen needed, and when their term of\noffice has expired shall say, well done\nthy loyal and faithful servant.\nAfter reading this article to the\nfourth paragraph in which appears a\npublic denunciation of a certain clique,\nin and about the depot of a certain\nneighborhood. Then it devolves upon\nme as a citizen of this certain neigh\nborhood to raise my pen land voice if\nneed be) in the protection of the hon\nor, life, and rights of this referred to\nou have been\nand consti\ntutes a membership of two. The\nmembers being myself, Rozelle D.\nLawrence, and my soldier friend,\nFord H. Smith, who served his coun\ntry and served it well during that bit\nter conflict between Germany and this\ngreat country of ours. I find that I\nwould be unworthy of the recognition\nof society and a disgrace to the ex\nsoldiers of the United State Army\nshould I permit this damnable, unjust,\nand unwarranted article to poison the\nminds of the people of Claiborne\nclique. This clique that y\ntold about is composed\nCounty against my friend, Ford H.\nSmith and myself and not raise a\nword of resentment. Therefore, this\nis why that I in my humble station in\nlife am now trying to bring this of\nfender of justice to the light of day\nthat right and justice may\nured unto us. I\'m forced to proceed\nin this manner and use harsher terms\nthan I desire, but I must protect our\nnames and our lives from the slander\nous pen of one who is too cowardly\nand inhumane to verify these dirty\nallegations by affixing his name there\nto. Such a character is a menace to\ncivilization, is the originator of re\nbellion and disorder, and has an ut\nter disregard for law and order. It\nthrows its viperous wings around the\npublic and shields\nby deluding itself as "a citizen."\nIf you will go with me through this\narticle you will readily see that it has\nreference to myself and my friend\nFord H. Smith. This is not the old\naxiom, "it is always the bit dog that\nhollow\'s," as the depot at Carlisle,\nMississippi is the only depot in Clai\nborne county that thirty children take\nbe meas\nitself from sight\nfor\niff\nby\nto\nthe\nto\nthe\nin\nthe train daily for school, and, too, it\nis a certain fact that we receive a\nsum in compensation from the United\nStates Government for our physical\ninjuries that we received while in the\ndischarge of our duties as American\nsoldiers. This compensation was a\nwarded us after being examined by\nthe most learned men of the medical\nprofession. These gentlemen were the\nsole judges in our cases, and if we are\nnot entitled to this compensation, un\nder the federal law, they are solely\nto blame, and not us.\nIt is true that we are seen at the\nvillage of Carlisle, Mississippi fre\nquently. Why? Because this village\nis near our homes and our postoffice\nis located therein. Therefore, under\nthese facts that are given you I will\nnow ask this question. Haven\'t we\nthe moral right to file and answer to\nthis dirty attack upon our lives and\nhonor? I trust that the public will\nanswer in the affirmative.\nIf the writer of this article who has\ndeclared himself in bold terms "a citi\nzen" is a law abiding citizen, then it\ndevolves upon him after knowing that\nthe allegations of his article are true,\nshould make an affidavit before the\nproper officer of his county, setting\nout these facts and immediately the\narrest of these nefarious offenders of\nthe law will be made. This is the\nenlightened mode of procedure in such\ncases, and that system of procedure\nwhich is advocated by the writer was\nabolished when this country ceased to\nbe in the barbaric stage.\nIn conclusion I wish to state that I\nhave written this article solely in\nfairness to my friend Ford H. Smith,\nmyself, and the enlightened citizenry\nof Claiborne county. Any person\nthat possesses a degree of decency\nand honor would have signed his name\nto this damnable, corruptable, and un\nscrupleous article. I have written\nthis article in an effort to vindicate\nmy friend and myself of this unjust\nand grievous wrong which has been\nperpetrated upon us by one who is un\nworthy of the recognition of society.\nI trust that the public will appreciate\nmy position in this matter, and will\nforgive me for the harsh procedure\nthat I have been forced to pursue in\nthe necessary defense of my name, my\nlife and character.\nan\nor\non\nfive\nthe\nbe\nR.

Claiborne\'s Colton Crop Close on\nHeels or 1921 Yield.\nDespite the belief that tho cotton\ncrop this year is exceedingly short,\nreports to October 18th show that it\nwas only about GOO bales behind last\nyear on that date.\nAccording to W. A. Fife\'s figures,\ngathered from the various gins of the\ncounty, the total number of bales\nginned to Oct. 18th was 2,923, corn\ned with 3,550 to the same date in\n1921, a decrease of 623 bales.\nIt is a well known fact, however,\nthat the crop this year is earlier than\nthat of last season, and this accounts\nin large measure for the good show\ning made to date. But the crop is\nlarger than is generally believed.\nSome disheartened planters have been\nheard to declare that the yield would\nnot exceed 2500 bales, figures which\nwere passed by nearly 600 practically\ntwo-weeks ago. We feel safe in stat\ning that we may easily count on a\ncrop of 4000 bales. The Port Gibson\nOil Works Gin, which probably docs\nmore ginning than any of the other\ngins of the county, has already reach\ned 1600 bales and expects to have a\nbout 200 more. Hast season the total\nnumber of bales ginned there was a\nbout 2000.\nWith the increase in price of cotton\nthis year, which is from two to six\ncents, the present crop will lie worth\napproximately\nthe same as the crop of\nOffice of Secretary of State\nJackson, MisB., October 10, 1922\nPROPOSED AMENDMENTSTOTIIE\nCONSTITUTION OF THE STATE\nOF MISSISSIPPI;\nAt a regulur session of the legisla\nture of the state of Mississippi, held\nin January, February, March and Ap\nril, 1922, two concurrent resolutions\nwere adopted submitting to the quali\nfied electors of the state for ratifica\ntion or rejection at an election to be\nheld on Tuesday after the first Mon\nday in November, 1922, being the 7th\nday of November, 1922, which amend\nments arc in words and flguren follow\ning, to-wit;\nA Concurrent Resolution to amend\nSection 135 of the.Constitution of the\nState of Mississippi so as to abolish\nthe office of county treasurer.\nSECTION 1.
