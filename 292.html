Forty-one teachers from 10 daycare centers\nin small towns of the Southwest participated in the study. Results indicate that there was a high level of caregiving involvement and\njob satisfaction among the teachers. However, most teachers were dissatisfied with their current income levels, showed a moderate\nlevel of burnout, and yet did not express their intention to quit their present job. Correlation analyses reveal that teachers’ job\nsatisfaction was positively related to their interaction with children and colleagues, resources, and training but negatively correlated\nto burnout and quitting behavior. Teachers’ burnout and quitting behavior were negatively correlated to their interaction with\nchildren and colleagues, resources, training, and income. While the desire to work with children had a significant impact on\nteachers’ job satisfaction and burnout, income and level of collegiality significantly predicted their quitting behavior.\n1. Introduction\nAlthough research reports on the impact of daycare programs\non children’s early development and education are\navailable, little research has been done on the experiences and\ncharacteristics of infant-toddler child-care teachers, particularly\nthose residing in small urban communities in developed\nsocieties. The present study is designed to explore daycare\nteachers’ work environment in rural towns of the United\nStates. Modern economic and social conditions have made\ncenter-based daycare services essential in the lives of many\nAmericans [1–3]. The commercial daycare sector has evolved\nto provide care for children whose mothers work outside the\nhome and to create jobs for a number of people, mainly,\nwomen who work as child-care teachers and/or caregivers. In\n1863, the first commercial daycare center in the United States\nwas opened for the children of mothers who were employed\nby hospitals and for the children whose mothers made\nclothing for Civil War soldiers [4, 5]. Although the Lanham\nAct of 1941 considerably involved the federal government\nin financially supporting daycare programs in the country,\ngovernment funding was reduced substantially in the 1960s,\nespecially when compared to private sector funding. This\ntrend has continued and has negatively affected the quality\nof daycare services, as well as the productivity of more than\n57% of mothers with children under 2 years of age who are\ncurrently engaged in the paid labor force [6–9].\nThe realities of today’s economic development and\nwomen’s schooling have changed the traditional gender\nroles in society where mothers often need and/or desire\nto be economically independent. Also, increasing economic\nhardships and the growing divorce rate compel parents,\nespecially single parents, to take on employment. Under\nthese circumstances, daycare has become an aggregate effort\nand function of families, daycare workers, and institutions\n[10–12]. Under such a tridimensional system (i.e., family,\nteacher, and the government) of involvement, daycare has\nbecome an integral component of our social infrastructure.\nRealizing the necessity of center-based daycare services, child\nand family scholars argue that efforts should be focused\n', '2 Education Research International\non developing an effective daycare system that serves the\ncustodial and developmental needs of children. Such an\napproach to daycare can dispel the view that child-care\nteachers are mere “baby-sitters” by recognizing their vital\ncontributions toward the social, personal, and intellectual\ndevelopment of children [13, 14].\n2. Literature Review\nChild-care teachers serve as a temporary replacement for a\nchild’s parents, especially the mother, who is the principal\nsource of nourishment, comfort, security, attachment, and\nlove for that baby [11]. A teacher assumes the obligation\nto fulfill children’s basic needs and help facilitate their\nphysical, emotional, intellectual, and social development [1–\n3, 15]. In other words, a teacher takes on a large share of\nthe work involved in the upbringing of a child attending\ndaycare. Teachers’ qualifications are very much related to\nthe quality of a childcare service and, by extension, the\nquality of a child’s upbringing [16–18]. Typically, an involved\ndaycare teacher provides care to young children, maintains\ncontact with their parents or guardians to discuss the\nchildren’s progress, and communicates children’s needs with\nthe parents through parent-teacher conferences or informal\nmeetings [1–3].\nThe level of education and quality in training of daycare\nteachers are highly significant as these individuals are\nresponsible for providing care to a new generation. However,\ntraining and qualification requirements vary among states.\nSome states may require just a high school diploma, while\nother may require community college courses, or a college\ndegree in child development or early childhood development\n[1–3]. It is important that young children receive proper care\nto acquire social, cognitive and intellectual skills needed to\nunderstand and interact with their environment. Although\nchildren may learn without direct instruction, they develop\nmore fully with educated guidance [19]. Piaget [20] believed\nthat early childhood teachers should be highly intellectual\nwith knowledge in philosophy and psychology. This view\nwas strongly reinforced by the National Child Care Staffing\nStudy and the subsequent research that it inspired. Findings\nfrom prior research have consistently demonstrated that\nskilled and educated childcare staff produce higher quality\nprograms for children [21–24]. Besides academic knowledge,\nteachers should possess such human qualities as motivation,\ntruthfulness, sensitivity, understanding, and lovingness as\nthese human qualities are critical when children need care\nand attention [25]. The importance of a teacher’s nurturing\nbehavior in childcare and development cannot be overemphasized,\nand effective teachers must be responsive to the\nneeds of the children.\nQuality of care is the combined function of several\nfactors like teacher-infant ratio, staff turnover, and child\ndevelopment training for teachers [18, 25, 26]. Honig [25]\nemphasized that the staff ’s creativity and stability are necessary\nto comfort a baby separated from employed parents.\nHowever, current resources in the childcare field are so\ninadequate that funding quality programs and keeping care\naffordable while adequately compensating staff has become\ndifficult in the extreme [27]. Chronic underfunding of\ndaycare services cannot be overcome by mere creativity, and\ndecreases in program quality and staff turnover situations are\nmore likely to take place where programs are underfunded\nand teachers remain underpaid.\nAbout 1.4 million and 1.3 million jobs were held by\npreschool teachers and child-care teachers in the United\nStates in 2006 and 2008, respectively. Employment of childcare\nteachers continued to grow over the years and it is\nprojected to increase by 11% between 2008 and 2018 [1–3].\nCurrently, about 19% of all child-care teachers are employed\nin child daycare services and many of them are dissatisfied\nwith their jobs and suffer burnout mainly due to low pay and\nstressful job conditions [1–3]. Scholars argue that the feelings\nof dissatisfaction and burnout may lead to actual quitting,\nand an increasing quitting syndrome is detrimental to the\nphilosophy of quality and consistent daycare. The annual rate\nof turnover in daycare is very high—at least 40%—primarily\ndue to low wages [23, 28]. Daycare is one of the lowest of\nthe low paid occupations in the country. Currently, wage\ndifferences within the child-care field reflect the educational\nattainment of the teacher and the type of daycare center\ninvolved. Some economists and policy makers argue that\nmost of the teachers are women with little to no education\nand training, and, therefore, low wages are reasonable for\nthem [29].\nChild and family experts, however, suggest that the wages\nof early daycare and education staff should be linked to\nsimilarly educated elementary school teachers [27]. In fact,\nchild-care teachers’ wages have historically been about half\nthat of local public school teachers’ wages [30]. The overall\nmedian annual earnings of child daycare teachers were just\n$19,300 in 2010. The middle 50% earned between $17,210\nand $23,830 while the lowest 10% earned less than poverty\nwages at $15,900 for a family of three. Only the highest\n10% earned more than $29,280 [1–3].While the entry-level\neducational requirements for elementary school teachers\nis generally higher than that of most daycare teachers,\nthe income difference is nonetheless startling when one\ncompares the above reported numbers with the estimated\naverage salary of public elementary and secondary school\nteachers in the 2008-2009 school year—$56,050 [1–3]. The\nlow income potential for daycare teachers produces an all too\ncommon scenario in which many “burnt out” teachers quit\nto look for better paying jobs, thus leaving the quality and\nstability of daycare services in jeopardy.\nIn fact, “burnout” has received considerable attention in\nthe socio-psychological and socio-organizational literature\nsince the early 1970s [31, 32]. Most of the research on\nburnout has been directed toward two areas: helping professionals\n(e.g., counselors, teachers, social workers, school\nadministrators, psychologists) and public employees (e.g.,\npolice officers, air traffic controllers, appointed officials,\npublic health workers) [33, 34]. Yet, extant research suggests\nthat daycare teachers are more likely to experience burnout\nthan any other professional [35, 36]. Job burnout is related\nprimarily to sustained stress, which causes both physical\nand emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low levels\nof a sense of personal accomplishments [12, 37]. African\n', 'Education Research International 3\nAmerican caregivers experience higher levels of depersonalization\nand emotional exhaustion than Caucasian American\nteachers, and about 80% of child-care professionals had low\nlevels of a sense of personal accomplishment [38].\nIn the case of daycare services, inadequate work environment,\nlow wages, constant work pressure, and a steady flow\nof administrative issues promote dissatisfaction and turnover\namong child-care teachers [36, 39]. Scholars emphasize that\nburnout is an inherent and stress-producing conflict between\nthe professionals’ requirement to offer their services and the\nreality that they can never give enough [12, 40]. Dworkin\n[31] indicated a similar notion when defining teachers’\nburnout in terms of powerlessness and meaninglessness that\nare indeed indicative of job turnover. Also, interactions with\nsuperiors, colleagues, and children at the same time may\ncause child-care teachers to develop role conflicts and stress\nwhen issues of control and organizational conditions do not\nmeet their expectations [41]. These types of challenging job\nconditions may cause high turnover rates among child-care\nteachers since highly trained teachers would decide to leave\nthe profession if they were making low wages [42]. Others\nobserve that sociodemographic factors such as company\ntenure, age, gender, marital status, and education are not\nrelated to the level of job satisfaction of a child-care teacher\n[43].\n3. The Present Study\nAs we have indicated earlier, systematic investigations of\nthe nature of daycare work environments especially in small\ncities in the United States are very limited. In recent years,\nbecause of the rapid growth of these small communities,\nmainly due to in-migration of families from other cities in\nthe country, the need for daycare centers has been increasing.\nThis exploratory study assesses infant-toddler child-care\nteachers’ reports of their work environment in small urban\ncommunities located in the southwest region of the United\nStates.\n4. Research Objectives\nThe present study was designed to explore the following\nresearch objectives.\n(1) The degree to which infant-toddler child-care teachers\nare involved in their caregiving tasks.\n(2) The nature of their current job condition, including\njob satisfaction, burnout, and quitting behavior.\n(3) The relationship among caregiving involvement, job\ncondition, and SES variables (e.g., age, income,\neducation, work hours).\nFor the first research objective, descriptive analyses (e.g.,\nmeans, SDs) have been used to report the extent to which\nresearch participants described their involvement in caregiving\ntasks, job conditions, and salary satisfaction. For the\nsecond objective, Pearson correlation coefficients have been\ncalculated at the 0.05 level of significance to explore the\nassociations among caregiving involvement, job conditions,\nand SES variables. For the third objective, three multiple\nregressions at the 0.05 level of significance have been\nconducted to find out the influence of selected SES and job\nconditions on participants’ perceptions of job satisfaction,\njob burnout, and job quitting measures.\n5. Methods\n5.1. Participants. Forty-one infant-toddler child-care teachers\nfrom 10 daycare centers in three rural towns of the\nSouthwest participated in this study. From each participating\ncenter, all the full-time and assistant teachers working in the\ninfants and toddlers’ sections were interviewed. There were\nonly three assistant teachers who worked full-time and their\neducation and income were similar to the average of the\nentire sample. All respondents were female teachers and had\nworked at least six months in the current daycare centers at\nthe time of the survey. In the current analysis, we excluded\ndata from six participants who did not work exclusively in\nthe infant and toddler section.\nDemographic statistics show that teachers vary considerably\nin age (M = 35.33, SD = 11.37) and experience\n(M = 7.06 years, SD = 8.04 years). Twenty-six respondents\nwere married, ten were single, and five were divorced. Work\nschedule data proved more standardized with each teacher\nworking between 4 and 5 days per week (M = 4.83, SD =\n.38) and 6 to 10 hours per day (M = 8.29, SD = .87). Participants’\nreports suggest that 29 were Euro-Americans, 10\nwere Hispanics, one was American Indian, and the ethnicity\nof one participant was not reported. The individual median\nincome was $13,500 per year. Ten respondents had received a\nbachelor degree, and the mean number of years of schooling\ncompleted was 14.21 (SD = 2.43). About 88% of the respondents\nhad taken specialized educational courses such as early\nchildhood development, daycare management, parenting,\nspecial education, nutrition, nursing, and social work.\n5.2. Procedures. A trained research assistant personally contacted\nall the participating daycare centers and left the\nquestionnaires with the teachers to be filled out by them.\nThey were instructed to put the completed questionnaires\nin a supplied envelope that the research assistant would pick\nup from the center in two weeks. However, this procedure\nproduced very little success in getting responses from\nthe teachers. Therefore, the research assistant personally\ninterviewed each infant-toddler child-care teacher separately.\nThe research assistant was a male college student majoring\nin early childhood education and was familiar with the\ndaycare program in the region. In view of availability and\nminimal interference with work responsibility, participants\nwere interviewed during their lunch break at work and it took\nabout 30 minutes to complete one interview. All personally\ncontacted teachers in each center participated in the study.\n6. Measures\nWe used two questionnaires, Sociodemographic Questionnaire\nand Infant-Toddler Caregiving Questionnaire, to collect data\nfrom the participants.\n', '4 Education Research International\n1 2 3 4 5\nAttend\nAutonomy\nPlay\nTalk\nHold\nMean ratings\n4.72\n4.74\n4.81\n4.72\n4.2\nFigure 1: Mean ratings (1 = never to 5 = always) for caregivers’\ninvolvement in childcare measures.\n6.1.SociodemographicQuestionnaire. The sociodemographic\nquestionnaire contained 10 items concerning age, gender,\neducation, training, special courses, working days and hours,\nincome, marital status, total length of employment, and\nlength of employment at current place.\n6.2. Infant-Toddler Caregiving Questionnaire. A significant\namount of research has been conducted on the quality of\nchild-care and teachers’ work environment in the United\nStates [16, 18, 24, 44–49]. Some of these studies have shown\nrelationships between care providers’ characteristics (e.g.,\neducation, training, caregiving) and the quality of the care\n[45]. Several projects previously employed measures such\nas the Caregiver Interaction Scale [44] and the Positive\nCaregiving Checklist [48] to examine child-care teachers’\ncaregiving behavior and care quality. Unlike the current\nstudy, the core purpose of the above mentioned projects and\nmeasures was to address quality issues of child care. The\nassessment of infant-toddler teachers’ caregiving behaviors\nand job conditions was not done consistently across studies.\nTherefore, conceptualizing from previous measures on\ncare providers’ positive caregiving and interactions with\nyoung children [44, 48, 50, 51], the current questionnaire\nwas developed to assess infant-toddler teachers’ care behaviors,\njob conditions, and job satisfaction. This pilot-level\nquestionnaire is primarily a global index of teachers’ care\ninvolvement with children, and, hence, a pretest of the\nquestionnaire was conducted prior to the administration of\nit. The first author and a trained research assistant visited\na daycare center (which is not included in the sample)\nfor two days, during which two teachers were interviewed\nwith the constructed questionnaire. The pretest provided\nopportunities to effectively edit the questionnaires, clarify\nseveral ambiguous questions, and economize the duration of\nthe interview.\nThe Infant-Toddler Caregiving Questionnaire consists of\nthree major sections. The first section of the questionnaire\ncomprises five Likert-type items designed to assess the\ndegree to which child-care teachers participate in caregiving\nactivities. The items are: attend to children when crying;\nencourage children’s autonomy; play with children every day;\ntalk to children when changing diaper; and hold children\nwhile feeding. Each item is rated from 1 (never) to 5 (always).\nThe second section of the questionnaire is comprised of eight\nLikert-type items designed to assess the degree to which\nchild-care teachers describe their current job conditions. The\njob condition items are as follows: “I am satisfied with my\njob,” “I cope well with children,” “I get along well with my\ncolleagues,” “this daycare center has adequate resources,” “I\nhave sufficient training in childcare,” “I make home visits,”\n“I feel burnout doing this job,” and “I want to quit this job.”\nEach item is rated from 1 (never) to 5 (always). The second\nsection also includes two categorical items to assess whether\nrespondents want to quit their current job and reasons for\nwanting to quit the current job or not. The final section of the\nquestionnaire comprises three Likert-type items designed to\nassess the degree to which child-care teachers describe their\nsalary satisfaction. The items are as follows: “I get adequate\nsalary from this job,” “I manage well with this income,” and\n“I deserve better pay.” Each item is rated from 1 (never) to 5\n(always).\n7. Results\n7.1. Descriptive Analysis\n7.1.1. Caregiving Involvement. Study participants ranked\neach of the five caregiving measures very highly. The lowest\nmean score (M = 4.21, SD = .88) was found in the “hold\nchildren while feeding” category. All other mean scores were\n4.72 or more with a high of 4.81 in the “play with children\neveryday” caregiving measure. Overall, participants rated\nthemselves as highly attentive and engaged caregivers. The\nmeans of all the five items of caregiving involvement are\npresented in Figure 1.\n7.1.2. Job Conditions. Responding to the statement “I am\nsatisfied with my job,” respondents expressed a high level\nof job satisfaction (M = 4.10, SD = 1.07). Likewise,\nrespondents indicated they “cope well with children” (M =\n4.15, SD = 1.29) and “get along with colleagues” (M = 4.53,\nSD = .93). Caregivers also agreed quite strongly with the\nstatements “the center has adequate resources” (M = 4.15,\nSD = 1.17) and “I have sufficient training in childcare”\n(M = 4.10, SD = 1.10). Low mean scores were observed for\nthe statements “I make home visits” (M = 2.32, SD = 1.51)\nand “I feel burnout doing this job” (M = 3.00, SD = 1.38),\nand “I want to quit this job” (M = 1.80, SD = 1.08). The low\nmean score on quitting behavior is supported by percentage\nanalysis from a follow up question “do you plan to quit your\njob soon,” to which only 7.69% answered “yes.” The mean\nscores on eight measures of job condition are presented in\nFigure 2.\n7.1.3. Salary Satisfaction. As indicated earlier, annual individual\nincome varied widely among respondents. Measures\nconcerning satisfaction with salary returned mixed results. In\nresponse to the statements “I get adequate salary” (M = 2.97,\nSD = 1.27), and “I manage well on my salary” (M = 3.21, SD\n= 1.09), teachers varied a great deal in their responses with\nthe net result being neither strongly satisfied nor dissatisfied.\n', 'Education Research International 5\n1.8\n3\n2.32\n4.1\n4.14\n4.53\n4.1\n4.15\n1 2 3 4 5\nWant to quit\nFeel burnout\nMake home visit\nJob satisfaction\nCope well\nwith children\nCope well\nwith colleagues\nAdequate\nresources\nMean ratings\nSufficient training\nFigure 2: Mean ratings (1 = never to 5 = always) for job condition\nvariables.\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\nSalary is adequate Manage with salary Deserve better pay\nM\nea\nn\n r\nat\nin\ngs\nFigure 3: Mean ratings (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree)\nfor salary satisfaction.\nIn response to “I deserve better pay” the respondents agreed\nmore strongly (M = 4.03, SD = 1.26). These averages are\npresented in Figure 3.\n7.2. Correlations\n7.2.1. Caregiving Involvement. Pearson correlation analysis\nshowed that the statement “I attend to children when crying”\nis positively correlated to “I play with children everyday” (r =\n.46, P < .01), “I talk to children when diapering” (r = .36,\nP < .05), “I hold children while feeding” (r = .56, P < .01),\nand respondents’ “age” (r = .40, P < .05). Furthermore, the\nstatement “I encourage children’s autonomy” was positively\ncorrelated to “I talk to children when diapering” (r = .54,\nP < .01). The correlation coefficients are presented in Table 1.\n7.2.2. Job Conditions. Respondents’ report of the level of job\nsatisfaction (i.e., I am satisfied with my job) was positively\ncorrelated to “I cope well with children” (r = .66, P < .01),\n“I get along with my colleagues” (r = .65, P < .01), “this\ncenter has adequate resources” (r = .63, P < .01), and “I\nhave sufficient training in childcare” (r = .54, P < .01).\nThe statement “I cope well with children” showed positive\nassociations with “I get along with my colleagues” (r = .59,\nP < .01), “this center has adequate resources” (r = .58, P <\n.01), and “I have sufficient training in childcare” (r = .61,\nP < .01). Similarly, “I get along with my colleagues” was\npositively correlated to “this center has adequate resources”\n(r = .71, P < .01) and “I have sufficient training in\nchildcare” (r = .64, P < .01). Furthermore, the statement\n“this center has adequate resources” was positively correlated\nto the statement “I have sufficient training in childcare” (r =\n.70, P < .01). Finally, the statement “I feel burnout doing\nthis job” was positively correlated to “I want to quit this job”\n(r = .60, P < .01). The results are presented in Table 1.\nRespondents’ report of the level of job satisfaction (i.e., I\nam satisfied with my job) was negatively correlated to “I feel\nburnout doing this job” (r = −.57, P < .01) and “I want to\nquit this job” (r = −.72, P < .01). The statement “I cope\nwell with children” showed negative associations with “I feel\nburnout doing this job” (r = −.62, P < .01) and “I want to\nquit this job” (r = −.55, P < .01). Similarly, “I get along with\nmy colleagues” was negatively correlated to “I feel burnout\ndoing this job” (r = −.37, P < .05) and “I want to quit this\njob” (r = −.67, P < .01). Furthermore, the statement “this\ncenter has adequate resources” was negatively correlated to “I\nmake home visits” (r = −.39, P < .05), “I feel burnout doing\nthis job” (r = −.38, P < .05) and “I want to quit this job” (r =\n−.57, P < .01). The statement “I have sufficient training in\nchildcare” was negatively correlated to “I feel burnout doing\nthis job” (r = −.35, P < .05) and “I want to quit this job”\n(r = −.48, P < .01) (Table 1).\n7.2.3. SES Variables. Among the SES variables (age, income,\neducation, and work hours), only age was positively correlated\nto the caregiving item “I attend to children when\ncrying” (r = .40, P < .05). Income was positively correlated\nto “I make home visits,” (r = .42, P < .05), but was negatively\ncorrelated to “I feel burnout doing this job,” (r = −.33,\nP < .05) and “I want to quit this job” (r = −.38, P < .05)\n(Table 1).\n8. Regression Analysis\nThree separate regression analyses were conducted to assess\nthe impact of selected SES (e.g., income) and job condition\n(e.g., cope with children, cope with colleagues, resources,\nand training) variables on job satisfaction, burnout, and\nquit measures. The regression coefficients are presented in\nTable 2.

Discussion\nThis exploratory study is an attempt to understand infanttoddler\nchild-care teachers’ involvement in caregiving tasks,\nthe nature of their job conditions, and the relationships\namong involvement, job condition, and SES variables.\nAlthough the current study is exploratory and the findings\nmay not be generalized, the data are unique and worth\nreporting especially because they represent samples from\ndaycare centers located in relatively less studied rural town\ncommunities in the United States. Furthermore, the authors\nbelieve that understanding the experience of child-care\nteachers’ working conditions and job satisfaction in relation\nto their training, resources, ability to cope with children and\npeers, and low wages contribute to the existing literature.\nDescriptive analyses of self-reports suggest that infanttoddler\nchild-care teachers in this study provide positive\nand/or involved caregiving [48]. They hold children while\nfeeding, tend to them when crying, and talk with them\nwhen changing their diaper. They also encourage children’s\nautonomy and play with them. Child-care teachers report\nthat they cope well with the work situation in which they\nprovide care to young children and interact positively with\ntheir superiors and colleagues as well. Respondents also\nreport that they have sufficient training, their workplace\nhas adequate resources, and they are satisfied with their\ncurrent job. Similar to reports by other scholars [2, 16, 17,\n48], it can be argued from the current findings that the\nhigh level of caregiving involvement and interactions and\npositive assessment of selected job conditions are indicative\nof teachers’ involved caregiving. The current findings tend to\nlend support to the notion that adequate training, available\nresources at the workplace, and a high level of involvement\nare expected to create a stable caregiving environment for\nyoung children [10, 22, 23, 25].\nAlthough a large proportion (83.33%) of the respondents\nstated that their current income was not reasonable, only\n7.69% of the respondents stated their intention to quit. This\nscenario is further supported by a very low average rating\n', 'Education Research International 7\n(1.80 when 1 = never) for the item “I want to quit this job.”\nThe proportion of respondents who stated their intentions\nto quit is far below than the figure mentioned in previously\nconducted research regarding a turnover rate of 40% [23, 28].\nAlthough there was only a small number of participants who\nanswered in the affirmative to the question “do you want\nto quit this job?,” it may be worthwhile to review the way\nthey responded to this question. Several answers to an openended\nfollow-up question on the reasons for wanting to quit\nemerged. The responses included low wages, plan to return\nto college to train for a higher paying job, lack of long-term\nbenefits, and lack of social prestige. Daycare administrators\nmay find this information useful as they develop strategies to\naddress child-care teachers’ quitting behavior.\nThe current findings point to the need to examine\nvarious contextual factors within and external to the teachers’\nwork situation that may influence their moderate burnout\nand low turnover rate [35, 38, 43]. Teachers in the centers\nunder study indicated a high level of satisfaction with their\ncurrent jobs. While this may be a great consolation to\ndaycare administrators, it is, nevertheless, important to bear\nin mind that the study was based on a very small sample.\nConsequently, the findings cannot be generalized to the\nlarger population. Although a very high proportion of the\nsubjects indicated a high degree of satisfaction with their\njob, it was quite disconcerting to find that respondents\nstated a moderate level of burnout. Moreover, over 83%\nof the sample gave the response that their income was not\nreasonable. In light of the current findings and the findings\nfrom previous research [27, 42], we could anticipate that\nmany of the respondents may leave their jobs sometime in\nthe future, presumably once they are able to find alternative\nemployment. This assumption can be tested in subsequent\nresearch with a sound design and large sample.\nMost child-care teachers in this study, although underpaid,\nexpressed their intention to stay at their current jobs\nbecause they want to work with young children. It appears\nthat teachers’ commitment and willingness to care for the\nyoung children may compensate for low salary. This particular\nview is further supported by regression analyses that\nare discussed later in this section. However, it can be further\nargued that the respondents did not want to leave their\ncurrent jobs due to the low number of job prospects in their\ncommunities. Also, the sample consisted of a substantial\nproportion (45%) in the age category below 30 years and\na good percentage (26%) has worked for less than three\nyears at their present job. It is highly probable that these\nyoung caregivers have a lot of enthusiasm at present, but\nthis enthusiasm may not be enough to predict that they can\nsustain this interest level in the face of low remuneration.\nNotwithstanding the negative interpretations of the findings,\nthis study has indicated that to a certain extent teachers’\nconsideration of better wages, as reported in their qualitative\nnarratives, does play a part in their intentions to quit [39, 42].\nSubsequent empirical research can be designed to address\nthese points.\nCorrelational findings suggest that teachers who attend\nto children when they cry are more likely to talk, hold, and\nplay with children. Also, teachers who encourage children’s\nautonomy are more likely to talk to children. Sufficient\ntraining encourages teachers to participate in activities\nrelated to children’s autonomy and emotional regulations\nsuch as crying. These findings will encourage scholars to\nconduct future research investigating the degree to which\nteachers’ involvement positively contributes to children’s\nsocial and intellectual growth [13, 15]. Furthermore, teachers\nwho want to quit their jobs encourage less autonomy in\nchildren and cope less well with children and colleagues.\nSatisfied teachers cope well with children and colleagues,\nand sufficient training may encourage them to stay on the\njob. But teachers are more likely to quit if they are not\nsatisfied with their job or feel burnout, and if they perceive\nthat their income is less than adequate [36, 39]. In general,\nwhile teachers’ income appears to be negatively associated\nwith their burnout and quitting behaviors, teachers’ job\nsatisfaction was positively related to their training, resources,\nand interactions with children and colleagues.\nRegression analyses reveal that the ability to cope with\nchildren positively influences the levels of teachers’ job satisfaction\nbut negatively influences the levels of their burnout.\nIn a similar vein, both income and the ability to cope\nwith colleagues negatively impact teachers’ quitting behavior.\nThese findings clearly suggest that teachers’ willingness\nand the ability to work with children would help ensure\nteachers’ job satisfaction that, in turn, may lead to sustain\nthe consistency of a daycare program. Furthermore, teachers’\nwillingness and ability to work with children and colleagues\nand an adequate salary would encourage them to stay on the\njob and provide consistent caregiving [27, 30, 42, 52]. Taken\ntogether, while teachers’ willingness to work with children\npositively predicts their levels of job satisfaction on the one\nhand, the ability to cope with children negatively predicts\nteachers’ burnout on the other. Also, factors such as ability to\ncope with colleagues and income negatively predict teachers’\nquitting behavior.\nIn sum, child-care teachers in the current sample show\nhigh levels of involvement in their caregiving activities.\nThey perceive that they have adequate training in childcare\nand the work places have resources to support their\nresponsibilities. They also report that they cope well with\ntheir colleagues and children. Although a high percentage of\nthe respondents were not satisfied with their present wages,\nthey feel a moderate level of burnout and are less likely to quit\ntheir current job. More importantly, coping with children\nand colleagues and income appear to strongly predict\nteachers’ job satisfaction, burnout and quitting behavior.\nA closer look at the relationships among these variables\nhas significant implications for daycare administrators and\nprogram directors.\n10. Implications for Policy\nPolicy makers and parents expect consistent and quality\ncare for young children [45] and high quality care has\npositive effects on children’s cognitive and social outcomes\n[10, 16]. In light of these concerns as well as the current\ncorrelational findings, several practical implications of the\ncurrent work are very clear. Center-based daycare systems\n', '8 Education Research International\nand parents must recognize the fact that infant and toddler\nchild-care teachers are highly involved in their professional\nresponsibilities. It is important that administrators and\npolicy makers encourage child-care teachers to have necessary\ntraining and provide them with adequate support to\nrecruit and retain them for the job. It is apparent from\nthe current findings that high levels of involvement and\nan increased sense of competence in coping with children\nmay minimize teachers’ perception of burnout and quitting\nbehavior. Also, administrators and program directors should\nprovide collegial and adaptive work environment to ensure\nteachers’ job satisfaction. Another policy option would be to\ninitiate and implement efforts to increase the salary for childcare\nteachers in daycare services. This is another important\nway to encourage teachers’ continued commitment to their\njob and to recognize their significant contributions in the\ncare of young children. Importantly, more institutional\n(i.e., state, federal) involvement in terms of financial and\nother logistical support can make jobs in the field of\ndaycare services quite attractive to dedicated and well-trained\nindividuals.\n11. Limitations\nFindings from the current study should be interpreted with a\nnumber of limitations in mind. The scores on the measured\nvariables were self-rated. Had the design included a rating by\nthe observers, different findings might have been obtained.\nWhile interviewing teachers, some interruptions occurred\nsince they had to attend to children demanding attention.\nSuch distractions might have influenced some of their\nresponses. While working, some respondents might have felt\nuncomfortable or were physically and mentally unprepared\nto answer questions; thus, in order to reduce the duration of\nthe interview, such respondents may have felt a reluctance to\nprovide detailed information. Stated differently, due to the\nnature and size of the sample, there is limited generalizability\nof the findings across daycare centers. In addition, some\ndata that could have proved useful in the analysis were\nnot collected; for example, data regarding teachers’ social\nsupports could have facilitated further elaboration on job\nsatisfaction. These topics are worthy of future study. It is\nimportant to note that it was not possible to avoid sex\nbiases, as all respondents were female, thus limiting the\nability to explore any sex differences in teachers’ involvement,\nburnout, and job satisfaction. However, aside from these\nlimitations, it is expected that the collected data can be\nconsidered adequate for this exploratory study that has\nattempted to systematically document the patterns of childcare\nteachers’ caregiving involvement and working condi-\ntions in small urban settings in an industrialized nation.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank the Directors of the Centers involved for\ntheir permission to conduct the survey, the caregivers for\ntheir participation in the study, and Charles Burnham, James\nParr, and Mark Hrastar for their help with the data collection\nand coding.\nReferences\n[1] U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, Career Guide to Industries,\n2010-2011 Edition, Child Day Care Services, Washington, DC,\nUSA, 2010.\n[2] U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Outlook Handbook,\n2010-2011 Edition, Child Care workers, Washington, DC,\nUSA, 2010.\n[3] U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and\nWages, May 2010, Secondary School Teachers, Washington, DC,\nUSA, 2010.\n[4] M.
