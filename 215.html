LX- NO. 57\nMACK CUMS\nROBERT BRIDGES\nDEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WOULD\nDISCI\'SS WITH FARME R- KA HOIt\nCANDIDATE, NOT NORTH DA\nKOTA, BIT WASHINGTON.\nJudge W. W. Black. Democratic\nnominee for governor, has issued the\nfollowing open letter to Robert\nBridges:\n*\'Hon. Robert Bridges,\n"Candidate for Governor.\n"Orillia. Wash.\n"Dear Sir:\n"I notice in the Seattle papers that\nin a public meeting in that city last\nFriday night you issued a challenge\nto any gubernatorial candidate to de\nbate with you concerning the non\npartisan laws of North Dakota. Since\nthe voters of North Dakota will\nthemselves shortly express their own\nopinion of the suitability of their par\nticular laws to the peculiar condi\ntions existing In that distant state\nwithout any concern whatever as to\nwhat you or I might think or say. the\nspecific debate you seek is hardly a\npractical one.\n"You must realize that the voters\nof Washington are directly interest\ned in the welfare and prosperity of\nthis state. They want light upon the\nquestion of whether they should vote\nin November for Louis K. Hart, or\nW. W. Black, or Robert Bridges ro\nbe their state executive for the vltul\nly important next four years.\n"Now, in order to at once place the\nissue between us upon a practical\nbasis, I directly challenge you to de\nbate tbe question of which of us\nthree .the people of this state should\nvote tor on November 2nd in order\nto benefit the people of the state as a\nwhole and to promote Industrial\npeace and public prosperity. .\n"As arrangements are being com\npleted by the democratic campaign\ncommittee for a speaking tour begin\nning Monday, the 27th of September,\nand continuing until election day.\nwhich will take me Into every corner\nof this state. It Is almost Imperative.\nIn order that my campaign against\nthe republican nominee be not 100\ngreatly interfered with, that you ar\nrange to hold such proposed Seattle\ndebate some time during the "week\nending Saturday, September 25th.\n"I am also very willing to engage\nin similar joint discussion at Tacotna\nand Spokane. If you care to do ao\nplease notify me of the dates as soon\nas possible so that my speaking pro\ngram may be changed to accommo\ndate such debates.\n"Debates with you at these throe\nlargest cities of the state will con\nsume all the time I can afford to\ntake from the strenuous campa\'gn I\nIntend to wage against Governor\nHart. I expect by November 2nd to\ndefeat Governor Hart upon the issue\nthat he is the enemy of labor, of the\nfarmer and of the public generally,\nand that his public acts are entirely\ndirected by certain favored special\nInterests. My platform Is a squear\ndeal for labor, business, farmers, pro\nfessional people, and men and wom\nen in all walks of life.\n"Now, concerning the proposed de\nbate with you. my proposal Is that\neach of us be allowed one hour, or,\nif you prefer, one hour and a quar\nter. The one who opens may reserve\nIB minutes of his time to reply to\nthe second speaker and the second\nspeaker may use five minutes of his\ntime to close the discusson. Each of\nus shall select some Individual and\nthese two shall jointly act as chair\nmen. The rent shall be borne by as\nequally and the general public, of\ncourse, must be admitted to the de\nbate.\n"You may have the choice of being j\nthe first or second speaker. You are\nRiven the right to select the times\najid places and number of the debates\nas well as the order of speaking so\nthat you can be deprived of no ad\nvantage.\n"Yours truly.\n(Signed) "W. W.

Tiny must also elect two-thirds of the members (if the senate\nwhen two-thirds of the members ol the senate are not lip i<ir election.\nThe democratic treaty promise is a promise ut tl.e impossible. A\ndemocratic victory means an indefinite prolongation of tin- present\nunsatisfactory status. The republican fim-nd of the league who votes\nfor lox more than throws away his vote lie defeats his own aim.\nMoreover. In* i :icourages continuance of democratic general inefli\nciency in national affairs and treads dangerously near the brewery\nand the wim cellar." —Oregoniati.\nSuch \'\'argument \' is being offered by republicans who favored\nthe League until their party went on record as bitter-ender opponents\nthereto. Let\'s examine it a moment.\nFirst the confident assertion that "the republicans are pledged\nto accomplish peace by joining an association THAT BOTH DEM\nOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAN. APPROVE." What assur\nance have you that the democrats will approve your new assoeia\n♦ ion, unless you are going to adopt the same league which you are\nnow pleased to call "the Wilson League"? If the republicans are\ngoing to adopt that after they have got into power, why can\'t they\napprove it now ?\nThe statement that "they must eleet two-thirds of the members\nof the senate when two-thirds are not up for election" is a plain\nmisstatement of facts. The democrats already have nearly halt 01\nthe senate. One-third of the senate is chosen each biennhun. There\nfore, if the democrats should win all the scats which are to be tilled\nthis election they would have more than two-thirds. Hut some of\nthe contested seats are in rock-ribbed republican states and some in\nsolid democratic states. It is true there are not seats enough from\ndoubtful states to make t( two-thirds majority for either party, but\nthe democrats have a better chance than the republicans of electing\na majority of the one-third chosen this year. llow then, is it any\nmore possible for the republicans to make peace with less than two\nthirds of the senate than for democrats to do so? It can happen only\non the theory that democrats are more patriotic and less hide-bound\npartisans than republicans.\n"A democratic victory means an indefinite prolongation of the\npresent unsatisfactory status." Why? That can be true only on the\ntheory that republicans will be so unpatriotic as to refuse to bow to\nthe will of the people. If the voters by the election of Cox and\nRoosevelt say that they want the United States to enter the League,\nwill the republican senators be so recalcitrant as to still refuse to\nratify a treaty which the whole nation has said must be ratified?\nWe do not believe republican senators are so "wilful" and unpa\ntriotic as that. We think better of them than the Oregonian does.\nAnd that fling about democratic inefficiency is abundantly\nswered by the conduct of the "most successful war in history. Cost\nmoney? Of course it did. Most of the material and war munitions\nprepared were never used, and therefore a waste? Would you rather\nthey had been used? Would you rather the tremendous preparation\nready to be launched upon Germany had not been made, and the war\ncontinued until a million more American boys had been slaughtered 1\nWasn\'t it infinitely cheaper to be so well prepared that Germany,\ninformed by her spies, quit cold, rather than go up against invasion\nand destruction!\nAnd, lastly, the "treads dangerously near the brewery and the\nwine cellar" plaint is off the same piece of insincere cloth that the\ncharge of inefficiency is cut from.

They are causing to be circulated,\nhe says, a statement to the effect "that there is no market for horses\nbecause the truck and tractor has displaced work animals, and there\nis no longer any use for them." He thinks the. farmers should be\nadvised that horses and mules are really in demand at good prices,\nand that they should not sacrifice their live stock but get the highest\nmarket price.\nA fine article on "Berry Crowing in "Western Washington" by\nJ.

It\njlieeded no legislative body to eiyict it.\nIt is the flat of the square deal. It Is\na part of the common law of man\nkind.\nAt the gate of the lost Eden. (Jod\nsaid to man: "In the sweat of thy\nface shalt thou eat bread." That\nmade the earth a world of working\npeople. Man at first thought work\'\nwas a curse. He soon descovered that\nit was a blessing. God was given\nhim plans for a new and better Eden\nthan the one he had lost.\nThen into this world of working\npeople came life\'s most binding cus\ntom and labor\'s most ancient law:\n"The laborer is worthy of his hire."\nTwo things are in that law. *\n• • •\nThe first is the dignity at man\nhood. It is not labor, but the laborer\nthat steps to the front. It is not labor\nthat makes the man respectable, bat\nthe man that makes labor respectable.\nThe individual comes before the\nsystem. Any scheme of society,\nwhether put forth in the name of cap\nital or of labor, that ignores or de\ngrades the individual, is vicious Labor\nunions have their uses, but they are\nworse than useless when their mem\nbers become the victims of a system.\nCapital has its rights, but capital has\nno rights that are in advance of the\nlaborer. «\nThe man takes precedence of the\nmachine. Labor exists for him rather\nthan he for labor.\nLet labor protect its reforms along\nthis line, promoting and maintain\ning the fundamental rights and\nessential dignity of the man who\nworks. Let the laborer lift his work\nwith himself.\n* * *\nThe second thing in this ancient\nlaw is compensation.\nWhat shall be the scale of wages?\nHow is the hire to be regulated? On\nwhat priciple is the question of pay\nto be adjusted? Here the laborer\nsteps to the front again. You cannot\nbuy him. Manhood is not for sale.\nYou are far gone in lawlessness on\nthe labor questiion, If you think tne\nwage you pay gives you a title to the\nsoul of the wage-earner.\nHe is worthy of his "hire." He can\nstand on his feet and look you in the\nface, man to man, without apology.\nQtrawberry\n3 plants\nGold Dollar, and\nClark Seedlings $5.00 per\nthousand plants; order early\nbefor? the prices advance.\nFall or Spring deliveery.\nBrigg\'s Fruit Ranch\nOlympia, Wash.\nHis compensation is, therefore, vastly\nmore than a matter of dollars ami\ncent • It in manhood\'s reward. That\ncovers decent living conditions and an\nadequate wage; but it covers more. It\nincludes what you cannot put on the\npay, roll—-good will, friendliness,\nmutual respect. human interest,\nb. otherliness. The laborer is of more\nimportance than the organization, and\ncompensation doe;; not stop with the\nscale.

It\nseems that when the Germans were\nforced to retrert they decided to de\nstroy this gun. They placed its muz\nzle only two or three feet from a re\ninforced concrete wall, four feet in\nthickness. They loaded tile gun, lit\na time fuse and then "beat it." thHr\ntheory being that the wall would stop\nthe long projectile and thus the gun\nwonld be bursted.

Many experiments and prac\ntical experience show that within\nthree generations most of the indi\nviduals in the scrub herd headed by\na good purebred sire resemble pure\nbred animals in appearance. In a\nfew more generations, under skillful\nbreeding and management, the for\nmer scrub stock is graded up to so\ngreat an extent that for production\nof meat and other animal products\nthey are practically as useful as pure\nbreds. The chief difference between\na high-grade animal and a purebred\nis in the value for breeding purposes.\nOnly the latter can be used in pro\nducing purebred breeding stocc.\nMoreover, only purebreds are eligible\nto registration in the different pure\nbred-breed associations.\nThe Department of Agriculture,\nthrough its cooperative state agen\ncies. is prepared to supply stock rais\ners with printed information that\ntells in popular language the b"st\nanimal breeding methods and tiie\nadvantages to be derived from their\nuse. In addition the department fur\nnishes an emblem of recognition,\nsuitable for display, to every farmer\nwho agrees to use, only purebred sires\nand to cooperate in other ways in the\nbetter livestock effort. To obtain the\nemblem the farmer or breeder is\nasked tp fill out a simple blank show\ning the number and kind of livestock\nhe possesses and also to declare that\nall his male breeding animals are\npurebred. i\nSCHOOL AGAIN"—WHAT IN YOI K\nCHIIJJ GKTTING Foil LI\'NCH?\nGrowing children have certain\nspecial needs in the way of food.

V»x General Jesus\n<suajuidi). who treacherously tricked\nand slew the wily rebel leader.\nKmiliano Zapata, himself fell a vic\ntim of deception when he was c.ip\ntured by government troops and exe\ncuted here. The tale of his latest\nand last adventure is thus told:\nThirteen months ago (iuajardo, a\ncolonel 111 Carranza\'s army, attacked\na detachment of his own faction\'s\ntroops, killed and wounded several\nof tliem and convinced Zapata that\nhe had a new adherent. Then, as\nZapata greeted him in salute, he had\nordered his men to fire on Zapata\nand the noted rebel chief was blown\nout of his saddle dead.\nTo reward this act, Carranza made\nthe double-dealer a general, and a\nlittle over a year later he turned upon\nhis benefctor and joined the success\nful revolution of Obregon and de la\nHuerta.\nAfter many misgivings they ac\ncepted him as a general in the new\narmy, and gave him the command of\n\'a brigade and he Rtarted for Torreon\njon a campaign against Villa. While\njen route he stopped his trains, as\nsembled his regimental commanders\ni and explained that he had resolved\n"not to recognize" the de la Huerta\n\'regime any longer but to go Into the\nfield for the newest revolution and\njoin Ozuna, Ricardo Gonzales and\nothers fighting to the eastward\naround Monterey. But several of his\ncolonels, his chief of staff and half\nhis command deserted him.\nFinally Guarjardo abandoned the\ntrains and started to march for the\nmountains of Nuevo Leon. Soon he\nlearned that Amaro, leaving the\nchase for Villa for the time, was on\nhis track and that the risings around\nMonterey had been failures. The\nremnant of his command melted\naway under attacks of government\ntroops until there remained only one\nfaithful colonel and an orderly.\nDressed in civilian clothes. General\nGuarjardo hid in the home of a rela\ntive in Monterey.\nMeanwhile Colonel Antonio Cano.\none of Guajardo\'s colonels who had\nabandoned him, had been captured\nIby federal troops, taken to Monterey\nland released there. Next day Colonel\n.Cano called at the house where Gua\nrjardo was hiding to visit the owner,\nFordson\n\\\nTRADE MARK\nFarm Tractor\nThe after service that goes with the Fordson tractor is second to\nnone.

The follow\ning directions for drying are given by j\nspecialists of the United States De- I\npartment of Agriculture.\nPumpkins used for drying may be\nof any variety, but the firm, solid\nfleshed, deep-colered varieties will\ngive a larger yield of a more highly\nflavored and consequently more desir\nable product. Either summer squash I\nor the late winter varieties may be\ndried. In any case the vegetables\nshould be mature and in good con\ndition for use fresh.\n| The treatment given pumpkin and\nsquash is identical. Cut the vegeta\n| bles into strips 2 inches wide and j\npeel. Remove the seeds and pass the j\nstrips through a rotary slicer set to j\ncut pieces one-half to flve-eighths inch j\nin thickness with a knife. Dip the j\npieces immediately into boiling water !\nor steam for 3 to 6 minutes. The\nvarieties vary so much as to the char- i\nacter of their flesh and the amount\nand depth of their color that a little j\nexperimenting is Necessary to tell,\njust how long a time is needed to com\nplete the process. Remove the pieces\nas soon as they become semitranspar\nent.\nIf a commercial dryer is used, |\nstart the drying Pt a temperature of\napproximately 135° P. and increase\nit gradually to 160° as the material\ndries. The tray should be looked over\nonce or twice in«order that any moist i\nspots may be opened and dried.\'\nPumpkin or squash should not be\ndried until brittle. The material is in\nproper condition for removing from\nthe evaporator when the pieces have\nbecome leathery, but show no mois\nture when cut across.\n, Capitol Group Architect in CitJ.\nR.

TrESDAV, SEPT EM HER 21. 1920\nGuineas are kept in the best breed\ning condition upon free range. Tluv\nmay be confined, however, if neces\nsary, with satisfactory results. On-?\nextensive guinea raiser confined as\nI many as 4 5 hens and 15 males in an\nacre pen throughout the breeding and\nlaying season. This pen is inclosed\nwith a wire fence 5 feet high and the\nbirds prevented from flying over by\nthe flight feathers of one wing being\nclipped. Within the pen is a grass\npasture with bushes here and there\ni where the hens make their nests by\n\'scratching out a bowl-shaped hollow\n■in the ground- The winters being\nsevere, a roosting shed is provided,\nhaving a cleated board reaching from\nthe floor to the roosts for the wing\nclipped birds to walk up.\nMost guinea raisers, however, alio*\'\ntheir breeding stock free range of the\nentire farm at all times. This helpr,\nto keep the birds strong and vigorous.\nDuring the winter the breeders should\nbe fed a grain mixture of corn, wheat,\nand oats twice a day. Where no\ngreen feed is available on the range\nat this time of the year, vegetables,\nsuch as potatoes, turnips, beets, and\ncabbage, should be substituted, poul\ntry specialists of the United States De\npartment of Agriculture suggest.\nAnimal feed is essential to best\nresults and can be supplied by feed\ning meat scrap or skim milk Given\nfree range, where the supply of nat\nural feed during the winter and early\nspring is ample, as it usually is in\nthe southern portion of the United\nStates, the guineas may be left to\npick up a considerable part of their\nfeed Free access to grit, charcoal,\nand oyster shell is necessary through\nout the breeding and laying season\nAvoid having the breeders too fat,\nbut keep them in good, firm flesh.\nIn so far ;is the effects of the opera\ntion and the rapidity and case of heal\ning arc concerned, the time of year\nwhen the operation is performed is of\nlittle importance. The capons seem\nto recover well at any time. Certain\nother considerations, however, influ\nence the time. The age and size of\nthe cockerel are very important. As\nsoon as the cockerels weigh 1 to\n2Vz pounds, or when 2 to 4 months\nold, they should be operated upon.\nThe lower age and we\'ght limits apply\nparticularly to the American breeds,\nwhile the higher apply to the Asiatics.\nCapons are in greatest demand and\nbring the best prices from the Christ\nmas season until the end of March.\nCapons are usually kept till they\nare about 10 months old. At this\ntime the market is at its best and the\nbirds have made their most profitable\ngains. The feed used and the methods\nof feeding vary greatly, so much so,\nindeed, that it is futile to give specific\ndirections. For several months after\nthe operation a good growing ration,\nnot a fattening one, is required. It\nmay consist of whole grains, ground\ngrains, or a combination of the two,\nas each feeder finds most profitable\nand best suited to his locality.\nwith other poultry, variety must be\ngiven for best results. Late in the\nfall, when the capons have no pas\nture, green feed, such as cut clover or\nvegetables, should be provided. A\nsomewhat more fattening ration than\nthat required for laying hens seemt>\nto give good results.\nAs capons are not usually marketed\nbefore Christmas, or the Ist of Janu\nary, they have to be housed during\nlate fail and early winter. Because of\ntheir quite disposition they stand\ncrowding quite well, and have been\nsuccessfully housed with only 2 or 3\nsquare feet of floor space to a fowl\nFree range for capons, however, is\nvery desirable, as it promotes their\ncontinuous, rapid, and economical\ngrowth, The cost of rearing capons\nto 10 months of age is a big item\nwith present high feed prices, unless\na good range is available.\nDuring the last month and a half\nbefore marketing the torn in the rat\nion should be gradually increased\nuntil the capons are on a full fatten\ning ration. For the last two or three\nweeks they may be shut up and fed in\ncrates, for every possible ounce at\nthis stage adds to appearance and\nprofit.\nGUINEA fWLN DREED BEST\nWHEN ALLOWED FREE RANGE\nB* Cknb Sughra\ntw—l\nPUBLIC APATHETIC IN\nREGARD TO INCKKASK\nOK EXPRESS KATKS\nThe hearing by the state public\nservice commission on the proposed\nincrease in state rates of the Amer\nican Express company was had in\nthe statehouse last Friday.\nA.
