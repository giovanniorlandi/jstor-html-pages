A smal\n3 vote was polled, as none of tbs\n3 candidates for Congress had op\n5 position. The fate of the consti\n3 tutional amendment is not yel\n3 definitely known, but it was prob\n5 ably ratified.\n3 Hughes, the Republican candi\ndate for Governor of New York,\ndefeated Hearst, the Democratic\nand Independence League candi\ndate, by less than 40,000. Hearst\ncarried Greater New York by\nj about 80,000. He also carried\n5 several other cities of the State\ni which have hitherto gone Repub\n| Iican. The farmer vote in the\nj upper part of the State defeated\n! him.\n• Returns from the congressional\n• districts throughout the country\n; indicate that the next congress\n’ will be Republican by a decreased\nI majority.\nThe Lincoln County Club.\nThe Lincoln county boys, who\nare students at the Mississippi\nAgricultural and Mechanical Col\nlege, met pursuant to call by E.\nM. Alderman Saturday evening,\nNov. 3, at 8 o’clock, for the pur\npose of organizing themselves into\na league to be known as The Lin\ncoln County Club. The call was\nresponded to by every member\nhere from our county, and the as\nsembly numbered thirteen stu\ndents, as follows: A. D. Alder\nmo n "I? TV\'T A 1 rl A rv-> rt n 13 13\nBlister, Walter C. Callender, .7.\nC. Callender, L. W. Greer, W.\nP. Holloway, J- D. Lofton, W. F.\n! Lofton, J. F. Price, V. C. Smith,\nE. Strait and W. R. Vernon.\nFrom this number the following\nofficers were elected: President,\nWalter C. Callender; vice-presi\ndent, A. D. Alderman; secretary\nand treasurer, J. C. Callender.\nIt is the purpose of this organi\nzation to hold meetings at regular\nappointed times, and to discuss\nsuch items as will be of interest\nand advantage to its members as\nstudents of a college. We hope to\nbecome more closely acquainted,\nwork to the advancement of each\nmember as much as possible, and\nto stimulate a college spirit, both\namong ourselves and in the com\nmunity of each student respective\nly. In this way, perchance, our\ncourty may be even more largely\nrepresented in the future than at\npresent.\nOur club is composed of young\nmen who m^an business, and who\nwill leave a reputation behind\nthem that will be a credit to those\nwho may follow in the future\nfrom Lincoln. Our members are\ndoing good work, and are win\nning the good will of instructors\nin charge of classes respectively.\nThough we have advanced only a\nshort distance from the “prep”\ndepartment, having members in\nFreshman and Sophomore work,\nwe can see the future Senior’s\npride beckoning us come; and\ne’er long we may look back over\nwork from the time we were bet\nter known as *‘preps,” to feel that\nsatisfaction and contentment that\ncomes only to those who, after\nmany days, weeks and months of\nhard study, have made a credita\nble pass on final Senior examina\ntion.\nWe’ll get there by and by!\nW.

In\naddition to our regular circula\ntion, a large number of extra\ncopies will be circulated within\nBrookbaven’s trade territory, and\nit will furnish an excellent me\ndium through which our enter\nprising merchants and business\nmen may reach the Christmas\nbuyers.\nA sensational injunction suit\nhas been filed with Chancellor\nLyell. The celebrated Byrd di\nvorce suit at Crystal Springs, has\nculminated in an effort of the for\nmer husband to restrain the erst\nwhile, wife from ruining his busi\nness.\nFIRE SATURDAY NIGHT.\n; Two Frame Dwellings Destroyed on\nRailroad Avenue.\nT-wo of the frame buildings or\nthe east side of Railroad Avenue\nnear Henderson & Turnbough’s\nstable were destroyed by fire .Sat\nurday night about 9 o’clock. The\nbuildings destroyed were occupied\nby tbo Canton Bottling Works,\nJones’ meat market, a negro tailor\nshop aud a restaurant. It is stat\ned that the fire started in the\nrestaurant, and it gained such\nheadway before the alarm was\nsounded, that all the firemen could\ndo when they arrived was to pre\nvent the flames spreading to other\nbuildings. This they did effect\nually, even saving a part of the\nburning buildings. In fact, when\nit comes to fighting fire, Brookha\nven’s fire laddies have few equals\nand no superiors.\nThe buildings destroyed were\nthe property of Messrs. L. H.\nBaggett and F. V. Becker. They\nwere valued at about $1200 or\n$1500 and insured for $600. The\noccupants of tbe buildings carried\nno insurance whatever, and Mr.\nJones’ loss in the way of market\nfixtures amounted to over $1000.\nNegro Sampler and Marker Removed.\nThe Leader has received during\nthe last few days communications\nfrom several farmers protesting\nagainst tho employment of a negro\nsampler and marker of cotton at\ntbe Brookhaven Compress. We\nwill state for tbe information of\nour correspondents and others in\npla*u\n*»ao ai uuu3 icicilcU Uj US\nto the compress officials, Messrs.\nLouis Cohn, J. W. McGrath, W.\nIL Seavey and others. They had\nreceived the same complaint from\nother quarters and determined to\nact. They’ wish it stated that the\nnegro has been removed and that\nthere will be no ground for com\nplaint on this score in the futureT\nMr. John M. M;i3r, a widely\nknown farmer and citizen\nof the county, who enjoys the\nconfidence of all who know him,\nhas been employed as cotton sam\npler and marker, and it is believ\ned he will fill the place acceptably’\nto all.\nFarmers can certainly not be\nblamed for kicking against a ne\ngro being placed in a position of\nthis kind; it is worse, so far as\nthey are concerned, than having a\nnegro postmaster, and the mixed\ngrades of cotton to be passed on\n(incident to last month’s storm)\ncould but intensify their irrita\ntion.\nThe compress management has\nacted wisely and done the right\nthing in so promptly deciding to\nremove the cause of complaint.\nCounty Teachers’ Association.\nThe Lincoln County Teachers’\nAssociation met in regular session\nSaturday, October 26.\nA most interesting program\nwas rendered.\nProf. T. P. Scott discussed the\ncourse of study for common\nschools. He commended the\ncourse now in use and plead uni\nformity in its application.\nMrs. Bessie W. Lipscomb favor\ned the association with a paper on\nNature Study. The paper was al\nmost poetic in its composition,\nbut entirely practical in its es\nsence. Many teachers were made\nto realize as never before the val\nue and beauty of Nature Study\nand the wonderful opportunity\nthat it gives the teacher for devel\noping the nobler nature of the\nchild.\nMiss Janie Drake, to the delight\nof all lovers of poetry present,\nread a paper on the characters of\nour nature poets, Burns, Bryant,\nWordsworth and Whitman. No\none who heard it could fail to\nhave a higher appreciation of\nthese authors. Miss Drake has\nlived in companionship with these\nauthors until she has imbibed\ntheir spirits. Several selections\nin music were given which were\nhighly appreciated.\nNEVADA MARTIN,\nSecretary.\nA Rankin county citizen reports\nthat on the Stephens place, near\nBrandon, Lelia Sparkman, a ne\ngress, gave birth to quadruplets,\nthree boys and one girl.^ The\nchildren were perfectly formed:\nbut died shortly atter birth.\n0000000000-00000-0-0-0-00000000\nfOur New |\nIPaint I\n| Department |\n5 Is a winner. 9\n8 We sell $\nI Devoe’s Paints I\nI Building Material f\n9 of all kinds at the old prices ?\n| C.

A representative o\nthis paper was sent to see th<\nB ayette Land Company, to inquirt\nwhether the “Free Want Col\nuraa,”<Which they have been run\nning proved remunerative. J. J\nMcGrath, the president and gen\neral manager of the company\nsaid :\n“My four years newspaper ex\nperience convinced me absolutely\nof the untold value of using prin\nter’s ink, and it has been my\npolicy since going into the real\nestate business, to use it unspar\ningly. We\' find that the column\nfor which wo contracted with the\nLeader has proved a bonanza. If\nwe haven’t anything on our books\nto suit an applicant, we advertise\nfor it in the Leader and the re\nsponses have come in so fast that\nI havA been compelled to work at\nnight and on Sundays in order to\nkeep up with them. You under\nstand we refer any answer to the\nadvertisement to the person that\napplied. The work has been so\nheavy in fact, that we have been\ncompelled to add three men to our\nforce, in addition toihe four who\nare in the office all the time in or\nder that we can carry out our\nmaxim of ‘right now,’ when any\none applies and inquires as to\nwhen they can see a certain piece\nof property.\n“The men we have added to our\nfor?e are: W. L. MacLean, for\nmerly a reporter on the Leader;\nA. 13. Bry^an, formerly of the\nBelknap Hardware Company of\nLouisville, and 13. O. Williams,\nstenographer with the Beattyville\nCoal Company.” — Lexington\n(Ivy.) Daily Leader.\nBrookhaven and Lincoln County Day\nat the State Exposition Nov. 9.\nAs previously stated in all the\nBrookhaven papers, Friday, Nov.\n9, has been sec aside as Brookha\nven and Lincoln county day at the\nState Exposition. The Illinois\nCentral is doing its share of work\nin helping to get a crowd and has\nannounced a special] fare for that\nday, it being $1.05 for children\n12 years of ago and under and\n$1.85 for adults. Tho train will\nleave Brookhaven at 7:10 in the\nmorning and arrive at Jackson at\nui?£,(jt 9 o’clock. The manage\nment of the Exposition will make\na special rate of admission and\ninasmuch as the return train will\nnot leave Jackson until 5:30 in\nthe evening those who go will have\nample time to take in the fair and\nsee the capitol building. Super\nintendent Edgar Green, of the\ncounty schools, desires every\nteacher and their pupils of this\ncounty to attend, requesting that\nthey suspend this day, as their\nsalary will go on just the same.\nThe Illinois Central has ordered\ntwo special coaches set aside for\nBrookhaven, and it is believed\nthat Lincoln county will send\nsomething like three hundred peo\nple on that day. Arrangements\nare now being made to have them\nmet at the station by a brass band\na$d escorted to the grounds. Let\nevery one turn out and make this\nsuccess.\nArt Exhibit at Public School.\nThe teachers of the Graded\nSchool have arranged to have the\nTurner pictures this year Novem\nber 21 to 21. The collection will\ncontain many new subjects and\nwill consist of entirely new prints\nand those who took advantage of\nthe opportunity to see them last\nyear will welcome the news that\nthey are to be exhibited again.\nThese pictures not only give great\npleasure, but also serve a fine pur\nnoeft nrln/infiAnnli t-r Un n\nnot only the pupils but the entire\ncommunity. Fifty cents will pur\nfchase a season ticket for an adult\nwhich will entitle tbe holder to\nadmission each of the four days\nand nights that the pictures are\non exhibition. The entire funds\nobtained from the sale of tickets\nwill be used for the purchase of\npictures to decorate the walls of\nthe school rooms.\nThis enterprise deserves, and\nwill no doubt receive the hearty\npatronage of the Brookhaven pub\nlic. •\nGin and Store Burned.\nThe steam gin of Mr. Martin\nCase and his store adjoining at\nBeaver Creek, in this county,\nwere destroyed by fire last Sat\nurday morning. Several bales of\ncotton and a good lot of seed be\nlonging to the gin’s customers\nwere burnt at the same time.\nThe loss on the gin was about\n$3,000, protected by $1700 insur\nance in the Mississippi Home,\nrepresented by the Underwriters’\nAgency, of this city. The loss on\nthe store and stock was about\n$800, with no insurance.\nMr. Case is an energetic, in\ndustrious, hard-working man, and\nhas the sympathy of many friends\nin his heavy loss.\nAt Saratoga, lire destroyed a\nhotel, the G. and S.

W. Stewart, H. S.\nRourke, E. Mitchell and Louis A.\nLundy, they being president,\ncashier and branch cashier and\ndirectors of the tank. These in\ndictments are different charges,\ngrowing out of the letting out of\nthe funds of the bank, such as\nembezzlement and grand larceny\nand receiving deposits knowing\nor having good reason to know\nthat the bank was insolvent, there\nbeing some twenty-nine indict\nments in all. There is but one\nagainst Mr. Lundy, but several\nagainst each of the others.\nHaving been connected with\nthis bank as vice-president and a\ndirector,we are gratified to be able\nto announce that the grand jury,\nbeing aided in their investigations\nand securing of data by an expert\naccountant, a receiver in charge\nof all data and counsel employed\nby depositors to fix the criminal\nresDonsibilitv. that we have been\nthus vindicated by the grand jury\ninquest of the county^n the mat\nter of our official connecttion with\nthis unfortunate institution.\nWe have invited and desired\nthis and all further investigation\nthat may be necessary, conscious\nof our entire innocence of any\nmoral wrong. We have lost heav\nily’, to the extent for self and fam\nily of $7,500, to say nothing of the\nhumiliation that the unexpected\nand surprising financial condition\nhas put upon us. We are deeply\ngrateful for this vindication as\nwell as for th6 many kind expres\nsions and manifestations of confi\ndence on the part of our friends.\nOur only concern on the subject\nof the criminal proceedings now\nis that justice shall be done and\nthe guilty punished as they de\nserve, and if.there be innocence\nthat there be vindication in their\nbehalf. — Pascagoula Democrat\nStar.\nCapt. P. K. Mayers, editor of\nthe Democrat-Star, the vice-presi\ndent and one of the directors of\nthe Scranton Bank, whose exoner\nation by the grand jury is thus\nreferred to, is the oldest member\nof the Mississippi Press Associa\ntion, and is the only surviving\ncharter member.

Managers complain\nthat offerings are still of poor\nquality owing to the fact that far\nmers are mixing seed from early\npickings damaged by storm with\nthe late pickings.\nAs this mixing is not universal,\nand many farmers have clean seed\nto offer, it stands to reason that\nthe mills will be eventually forced\nto make an advance in price, for\nmany farmers are bolding back\ntheir good seed and declare that\nthey will not sell at present quo\ntations; that the seed from cotton\nrecently ginned are of the guality\nthat makes prime oil, which is\nBelling at thirty cents per gallon,\nand tney will not part with seed\nof this quality at $11 to $12 per\nton, believing they are worth $15\nand $16.—Jackson Evening News.\nThe National Nut Growers’\nAssociation met in Scrantotfc Wed\nnesday.\nDemocratic Corporation Renegades.\nJudge Parker, the Democratic\nnominee for President, in the last\nNational election, now a corpora\ntion lawyer, is opposing Hearst’s\nelection to the Governorship of\nNew York; Grover Cleveland, the\nonly man elected to the Presiden\ncy on the Democratic ticket since\nthe war between the States, now\nconnected with one of the big life\ninsurance companies, is opposing\nIlearst. Corporation alliances\nseem to have an awful effect, even\non former Democrats, especially\nwhen the Democratic nominee\nhappens to be a genuine, sure\nenough trust buster. With all\nthe corporations of the Metropo\nlis of America against Ilearst, it\nis hardly possible for him to win\nthe office of Governor of the\n“Empire State,” and “more’s the\npity.” It is a sad commentary on\nAmerican manhood, a serious\nblow to free institutions, when\nmen permit themselves to be\nwarped or controlled by corporate\ninfluences in elections where the\nvital interests of the masses are\ninvolved. The great trouble with\nmortal man, whether high in the\ncouncils of party or State, or only\nan humble follower in the proces\nsion of humanity, is present self\ninterest.

C., Nov. 6.-—A\nreview of labor conditions in the\nSouthern States published here\nshows that the great need of the\nSouth at the present time is an\nadequate supply of efficient labor.\nIt is pointed out that with such a\nsupply the amount of cotton man\nufactured in the mills of the South\ncould he increased by 500,000\nbales next year, that the iron and\nsteel business of the South could\nbe doubled in five years, and that\nthe railroads could increase their\nfacilities so as to be able ot handle\nthe constantly growing traffic of\nthat section. It is net only in the\nmills and factories that the lack\nof labor is felt, but on the planta\ntions as well, for not only have\nmany of the negroes left the plan\ntations, but it is estimated tbat\nthe average efficiency cf the negro\nlaborer has decreased at least fifty\nper cent. Conditions are being\nimproved in some sections by im\nmigration from Europe and from\nthe North and the railroads of the\nSouth are constantly bringing the\nopportunities of that section to\nthe attention of workingmen in\nall parts of the country.\nEnact stringent vagrancy laws\nin the Southern States and enforce\nthem with mounted constabulary,\nis the solution of the race problem\nproposed by Win.II.Council, pres\nident of the Agricultural and Me\nchanical College, a negro school at\nNormal, Ala., in an address in\nWashington in which he did not\nundertake to defend the lawless\nmembers of his race, but insisted\nthat the Anglo-Saxons of the\nSouth were responisble for the\nlaws and should enact and enforce\nlaws that would drive from the\nland the negro brutes, the prod\nnnf nf r»o m lil i nlini 1 «¥■* I n\n- \' *“>-*-B -^\nand saloons, which exist by per\nmission of the white men who\nmake and enforce the laws.\nPresident Roosevelt’s decision\nto appoint Attorney General\nMoody to fill the vacancy on the\nSuprejne Court Bench is due to\nhis determination to have on that\ntribunal a man in harmony with\nhis own views as to centralization\nin government and the building\nup of the power of the President\nat the expense of the States and of\nCongress. Ho hesitated for a\ntime between Mr. Moody and\nJudge Lurton, of Tennessee. The\nreputation of the latter as an able\nand upright judge is as high as\nthat of any man on the bench, but\nhe has indicated by his decisions a\nbelief that the Constitution means\nwhat it says and that it was in\ntended to safeguard the reserved\nrights of the States, and so he was\npassed over fpr a man whose legal\nattainments have been something\nof a joke in Washington.\nTalk of a Southern man for the\nDemocratic nomination for the\nPresidency is becoming general in\nWashington as a result of the pe\nculiar conditions that prevail in\nthe ranks of the party in the\nNorth. It is split into at least\nthree factions all over the North\nand in some States there are even\nmore. First, there are what may\nbe termed the conservatives and\nthe radicals and the hopelessness\nof getting them to pull together\nfor any Northern candidate was\nillustrated in the Bryan and Par\nker campaigns. Then the radi\ncals are still further divided be\ntween the supporters of Mr.\nBryan and the followers of Mr.\nHearst, and neither one would\nreceive the loyal support of all the\nradicals, while either would be an\ntagonized by the conservatives.\nThe only solution that can give\nhopes of success at the polls is the\nnomination of a man from the\nSouth who has not been involved\nin any of the factional difficulties,\nof the North and who can unite\nhis party and bring it back to its\nold lines.\njames f.

The total amount of fines\nimposed for actual collection at\nthe September term of the Circuit\nCourt was, in round numbers,\n52,900, and this sum it is stated\nby Circuit Cleik Gunter, fully\ncovers the entire expense of the\ncourt. The fines, as recorded on\nthe books, aggregate ten times\nthis amouDt, in nearly every case\nttje larger portion of the fine was\nheld up pending fulure good be\nhavior, so that about all that is at\npresent collectible is $2,000.—\nColumbus Dispatch.\nTHE JACKSON EXPOSITION.\nOpened Monday and Now in Full Blast.\nThe State Exposition at Jaca\nsoii opened Monday on schedule\ntime, and promises to score a\ngreat success under the favorable\nweather conditions.

On the first Sunday of last\nmonth there began in Lhia city a\nprotracted religious service which,\nfinally, became known as “the\nCulpepper meetings.”\nThe Culpeppers, Hers. J. B.\nand Q. B., father and si n, were\ninvited here by Bev. Ceorge II.\nThompson, pastor of the Metho\ndist church, who with rJpr.:ecti\ntives of his church strongly desir\ned net only to benefit and buiid up\ntheir own denominational branch\nof the Great Cause, but to do\ngood unto all the people of Brook\nhaven. That these objects were\naccomplished is told in the results\nnoted below.\nDr. J. B. Culpepper is an ideal\nevangelist with a thorough knowl\nedge of the world, human weak\nness and duplicity, and a courage\nthat does not hesitate to say to the\nhighest or the lowest, “Thou art\nthe man.” Having lost sight of\nhimself in his great work, person\nal predilection or popularity are\nlost sight of, and he hews to the\nline, while the chips fall as they\nmay, often irritating or arousing\nthe more or less guilty or indiffer\nent. And in doing this, the good\nDoctor isn’t choice in the use of\nlanguage; and here in Brookhaven\nsome very proper people let their\nprejudices in this minor respect\nrun away with their very soul’s\nsalvation. In other words, how\never open to criticism Dr.\'Cul\npeppers methods or manner of\nspeaking may be, underlying it\nail is the great, strong current\nthat runs on to eternity itself,\nwith its freight of consecrated\ndesire and soul-stirring pleas for\nhumanity’s uplift. It was not\nuntil the last few days of the four\nweeks’ meeting that the opposi\ntion and criticism were worn\naway. During that time the Cul\npeppers persistently labored in\nword and deed and saw in the dis\ntance the victory that was bound\nto come; and by the close of the\nmeeting Monday morning, about\n66 souls bad been redeemed;\namong them a number of young\nmen.\nLaboring assiduously with his\nfather was “Burke,” whose elo\nr. n Anf n nfl 4* A n aU i n oi An., ka a « a .in/]\nM \' \' U V i«UU tUUUlllU ^ WVJL iUOUO\nappeals will never be forgotten by\nour people. His personal contact\nwith our boys was magnetic and\nhealing. He is a singer and choir\norganizer and did good work in\nthis feature of the meeting and,\nin every way, inspired young and\nold with his beautiful spirit, his\nready speech and his consecrated\npresence.\nMr. Thompson is gratified at\nthe success of the meeting in many\nrespects, and all Brookhaven,\nthough perhaps unconsciously,\nwill feel its effects. Sunday night\nwas a record-breaker as to attend\nance and the big Armory was lit\nerally jammed with humanity.\nMany manifested a desire to be\ncome followers in the high paths\nmade so plain by the preachers.\nOn Monday morning at the\nMethodist church a tender adieu\nwas spoken and the Culpeppers\nleft for a brief visit to their home\nat Iuka, Miss., before proceeding\nto Indian Territory to further\nprosecute their mission. A hand\nsome purse was given them as an\nexpression of appreciation of\ntheir services here.\nOn next Sabbath morning at\ntheir respective churches the pas\ntors will receive all applicants for\nchurch membership.\nFROM EDGAR.\nMessrs.
