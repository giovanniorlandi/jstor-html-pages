When the friends of\nthis scheme found that the same\nwould not be tolerated he the nAii- I\npie, they resorted to the scheme con\ntained in the present law, which pro\nvides for eight Commissioners, one\nto be chosen from each congressional\ndistrict by popular election. Under\nthis law, each commissioner will\nhave in his district the roads and\nbridges of ten or twelve comities to\nlook alter, without compensation.\nNo fifty men could discharge t.be du\nties which wuuld thus be imposed\nupon one single Commissioner and as\nhe is required to serve without pay,\nnobody but a rich man could afford\nto hold and discharge the duties of\nthis position which would require all\nof his time and very much-move.\nThe automobile tax has already\nOeeu placed in the hands of the High\nway Commission and will be used—\nnobody know liorw or where, but we\ndo know that the whole of the auto\nmobile tax paid by ar.v particular\ncounty may be expended on high\nways in other counties in which the\ncounty paying tax has no interest\nwhatever.\nAnd if the people adopt this amend\nment the general road tax paid by\nthe ttfx-payers of anv county may be\nused entirely on the the roads of dif\nferent counties just as the automo\nbile tax will be used.\nThe present system lias been in\nforce in tbit* Stake nearly u hundred\nyears and it will be extremely dan\ngerous to change or modify it.\nTt is true that the present s vstem\nlias not, at all times given complete\nsatisfaction to evotybody. No hu\nman system is perfect aud no human\nor divine system ever satisfied every\nbody all the time, but the present,\nsystem is extremely wise and i* the\nvery best we can devise. Its eftici\nciencv has been vindicated by long\nuse.\n(\nNothing iu the State is more iin\nportant than the public roads and\nbripges, and what the people need is\nnot so much intercounty or Inter\nstate highway to bo used mainly by\njoyriders, but the people need , the\npublic roads in the interior along\nwhich they go in visiting their neigh\nbors, and they want good roads to\ntheir churches and sehoolhousos to\ntheir couutv town and to their mar- ,\nket\nIf the people adopt this amend\nment and put these roads in the\nhands of the highway Commission,\nthese interior country highways will\nbe practically neglected.\nUnder vour present system vou\nhave a Supervisor iu each district\nwho is your friend and your neighbor\nand elected by your votes and this\nSupervisor gives a good and sulTi- ,\ncient bond to guarantee that he will\ndischarge, all the duties of his office, .\nespecially the care of public roads\naud bridges. You may easily see\nhim any day of the week and call his\nattention to auv defects in your road\nor bridge that need repair, vou ,\nput these roads in the hands of the\nHighway Commission, vou will have\nto go to Pontotoc or Tupelo or Jack\nson or somewhere else to Bud a Com\nmissioner to whcwm to make your\ncomplaint.\nIt is true tht.li the Legislature\nmight leave tbecare of the roods to\nthe Board of Snptxrvisors and might\nauthorize a special tax by each coun\ntv to maintain those roads, but this\nwould impose double taxation on our\npeople for road purposes—a thing wo\ndo not want and a thin;? we are not\nable to stand*.\nIt is unpotwit\'le under- t/liepresent\nt\nLegal Advertisement*\nBRIDGE CONTRACT NOTICE.\nNotice is hereby given that contract for the\nbuilding of a bridge over branch ul McLain,\naccording to plans anil specifications on file\nin the Clerk\'s office Will be let at public out\nerv at the front door of the courthouse in ‘the\ntown of LeakHHvllle.

Take a look at any oue\nof the courts to he seen all over the country.\nThe largest clubs are taxed to the limit of their\nfacilities to handle the crowds anxious to get a\nglimpse of leading players In action. The final\nof the American national championship, despite\nIntermittent rain, was played before a gallery of\nXT ,000 that overflowed the stands.

At the recent Tllden banquet\nWilliam M. Johnston took occasion to declare\nthat Tllden Is the greatest tennis player in the\nworld. Samuel Hnrdy went further In his esti\nmate. for he declared Tilden to be the greatest\ntilayer the world ever has known, and he pre\ndicted that In another season or two the cham\npion would be even greater than he Is today.\nRIIIv Johnston ought to know, for It\'s likely the\ni in itfiimn iiiui 11 uni\nhiblted In the opening set was\nsomething that stood on a\npinnacle of supremacy, over\nwhelming in its magntfirnnce.\na unique display of im.tchlesa\nstrength and skill that per\nmitted no resistance, and took\nthought of nothing but its\nown perfection.\nTn short.

He confirmed\nbis victory over Johnston by again heating him tn\nthe East vs. West matches In Philadelphia. More-\'\novy, lie won an even .■greater battle tlmn the one\non the courts by controlling his nerves, which a\nyear ago Imposed a handicap on his unquestioned\nskill. So say the students of the game, the ex\nperts who know.\nLike the science of warfare Itself, the science\nof every game that partakes of the nature of a\nflfiht Is a perpetual see-saw between attack and\ndefense. Now the one, now the other rules the\nptiiy and carries off the highest honors. In the\nfusclnatlng ense of lawn tennis the attack at pres\nent seems dominant, as it did 45 years ago when\npioneer volleyers were the cocks of the courts,\nthe Henshaws in England and Sears and Dwight\nlu America; or as It did In 1900, when Whitman\nand Ward and Davis were our champions and\ntheir new-fangled service was too much for visit\ning English ground-stroke experts; or In 1914,\nwhen McLoughlln\'s superb 8ttack flared up Into\na glorious moment of supremacy, taking the meas\nures of Brookes und Wilding\'—and then left him.\nThis man Tllden la attack personified, through\nhis service. He Is a long, lanky, able-bodied\nspecimen, with a strong arm, brains, concentra\ntion. and plenty of time for [wuetiee—all of which\nhns enabled him to develop more kinds of delivery\nthon f\'hristv Mathewson ever showed. Including\nthe system of pluy which were good enough for\nhoys were not good enough for the .larger compe\ntition. So 1 set about learning h better system.\nIt took me ahout two full years to get it. I was\neighteen and nineteen while this was going on\nand In the university.\n•‘I practiced the system I finally learned hy a\nprocess of elimination. Three things I watched—\nthe stroke Itself, the position of my feet and the\ndistribution of the weight of my body. If my\nfeet were ptuced correctly and my weight was\npro(>erly distributed ami still the ball did not re\nspond. then I knew the stroke Itself must he at\nfault, and so I worked at that. That was the way\n1 learned the game.\n“1 prnetlce now as much as seems to be neces\nsary. If 1 were to make a rule I should say three\nsets of tennis a duy. four days In the week, would\npe a good average. But when getting ready for\na match I train as much as is needed. You ean\nnot tell how much that Involves The thing to do\nIs to get your eye focused ou the ball. That may\ncome quickly or It may be slower. It may he de\nsiratile to play 1ft sets In one day and then to stop\nsharp\'y for a dW- 11 depends on your condition\nand on how quickly you respond.”\nTllden Is a nervous, wiry man. As with many\nwho are successful In different ways, lie absorbs\nenergy from the crowd. His heat gume Is played\nwhen excitement runs highest.\n"I will he |ierfectly frHtik and honest.” he said\n“1 love a crowd. In practice I am no good at all\nHalf of the kids I play with can heat me. ntert\nchildren whom I coach In practice. The excite\nment of a tournament Inspires me and makes m>\ngame better."\nWilliam T. Tllden II. lives, moves and has hit\nbeing In the realm of tenuis. Not only he thlnki\nahout his own game, ,but ulso he Is Interested It\nthe national and litteruatlonal recognition ol\ntennis.\n“The future of tennis Is bright," be said. “Th1i\ncountry ought to produce more good tennis play\nera than any other nation. There are now hun\ndreds and even thousands of hoys between twelvi\nand eighteen years who play real tennis. “Thank\nto thla Junior system and to the building of mu\nnldpel court* tennis Is becoming a truly nation*\ngame It 1* m longer a claaa game—thank Cks\nfor that"\none that—for the present, at least—is Ills own.\n“Own your own service" Is apparently his motto.\nWhen Tllden wants to follow his service in. lie\ngenerally does wtmt other experts generally do—\ndelivers a high-kicking ball that drags in the air\nand yet gives the striker-out plenty of pace to\ncontend with. But when he feels special need\nof a point he unexpectedly shoots over a nearly\nstraight under-spin ball that travels like a shell\nand proves the late Kuclld’s contention tliHt a\nstraight line Is the shortest distance from one\npoint to another. Moreover, the ball doesn\'t rise.\nHe doesn\'t run In behind that ball; why should\nhe? If it\'s good, the other man Is In luck to get\nbis racket on It, luckier to block It somehow\nacross the net—and If It does come buck Tllden\nwith his fine, shnrply-nngled driving has a pot\nshot at either side of the court.\nThis “unholy specially" of Tllden, his wickedest\nservice, undoubtedly rules the roost at present.\nIt puts attack ahead of defense at this writing.\nIn fact, some thoughtful devotees. Including ex\nperts of high authority, are asking whether, under\nthe rules as they stand, the player with the Initial\nattack, which Is to say the server, has not mors\nadvantage than Is good for the game.\nIf the rules should be changed to curb the server\nIt would not be the first time. But heretofore the\n/hnnges have been comparatively mild, and suc\ncessive brigades of Ingenious servers have con\ntrived to conform to them and still mulntain the\nadvantage. Anything further done uow would\nhave to be comparatively radical.\nSome experts say “change the rules; curb the\nserver." Others take the opposite view. “The\nbrilliant services which are being developed year\nly,” says Le Roy. "add to the Interest of the game\nand the delight of the spectators. It Is up to the\nplayers to develop equally brilliant defenses to off\nset the services."\nThose who have only seen the great tennis play\ner In action would probably not recognize him In\nwork-a-day habiliments, write* William Cbcnery\nin the New York Times. The tall, somewhat\nstooping boyish-looking young man walking slow*\ndethroned national title holder Is next best. John\nston stamps hltu. In the opinion of the experts, as\nnot only the greatest of all living tennis players,\nbut perhaps the greatest of all time.\nThe five sets were scored at 6-1, 1-6, 7-6. 6-7. 6-3.\nThis Tllden-Johnston straggle will go down on\nthe records as the most astounding exhibition of\ntennis, ihe most nerve-racking battle that the\ncourts have ever seen. Dp to this time, the fa\nmous final of 11116. in which Richard Norris Wil\nliams II. defeated Johnston for the championship,\nhad been considered the apex of tennis history.\nBut that great match faded into comparative In\nsignificance.\nWilliams and Johnston played five set* of me\nchanically perfect tennis. Tilden and Johnston\nplayed five sets of Incredible melodrama, with\na thrill In every scene, with horrible errors lead\ning suddenly to glorious achievements, with skill\nand courage and good and evil fortune Inex\ntricably mingled, and with a constant stimulus to\ncheers, groans and actual hysteria, ao far as the\nspectators were concerned.\nTo describe that amazing final as the most sig\nnificant of all American tennis tournaments, a\ntournament thnt unquestionably carried with It\nthe world’s championship, would require the su\nperlative of all the adjectives that the journalism\nof the game has either used up or discarded In\nthe past. It Is enough to sHy that all future dis\ncussions of the Olympian heights of tennis will\nprobably begin with the question. “Were you\nthere when—T” and the answer will be either "You\nbet I was” or “Curses, no." For the proud pos\nsessors of the affirmative no amplification Is neces\nsary. For the sad negatives nothing can be done,\ntor it will never happen again, at least not just\nthat way.\nPraise for the two contenders for the American\nchampionship of 1020 may be equally divided.\nThere Is plenty for both. Ttlden’s victory was a\ntriumph of supertennla. a vindication of the game\nwhich the bqpt Judges have for some time conshl\nOTSd Invincible. But. If Tilden la the greatest ten\nala player that aver lived, Johnston la the gam cat\nsaan that ever trod a court.\nTHEIR DAT OF ULUHf bUN*\nWriter See* Petho* In Vehicle*.

Entrance Into the Kingdom Urged.\n(vv. 13, 14),\nThere are two ways only before each\none—life and death, heaven and belt.\nThe grand Incentive held out is that It\nIs the way to life. He Just ns plainly\ndeclares that the gate affording an\nentrance Is straight and the way nnr\nrow. But while It Is straight and\nnarrow, It Is an open gate, and nit\nare Invited to enter. Though the gate\nthat leads to eternal life be straight\nand the way narrow In the beginning.\nIt broadens out in every respect until\nthe fullness of life Is realized. On the\nother hand, the way which at first\nseems broad and pleasant becomes the\nway of the most abject sjavery and liru\nl.ntlnn\nII. Warnings Against False Teach\ners (vv. 15-20).\n1. Their real existence (v. 15). Ever\nsince God has had a people, false\nprophets and teachers have appeared\namong them. That they appear every\nwhere need not at all surprise us. for\nChrist foretold that such should be\nthe case (Matt. 24:11).\n2. Their nature (v. 15). (1) They\nare hypocritical. The Devil does his\nmost successful work by masquerad\ning as an angel of light (II Cor. 11:14,\n15.) Ills ministers appear In this way j\nand turn people from the narrow to the\nbroad way. If the evil one would ap\npear as he really Is, his success would I\nnot be great. From the day when !\nhe appeared to Eve In the garden un- j\ntil this present time, his success has\nbeen due to his ability to deceive. (2)\nThey are destructive. This Is suggest\ned by their being ravening wolves. It\nIs when the wolf Is In sheep’s clothing\nthat he does his most destructive work. I\nIt Is so today. False teachers are do- j\ning their most deadly work while pre- j\ntending to be loyal to the Bible and to ■\nJesuS Christ. I\n3. The unfailing test (vv. lfr-18). J\n“By their fruits ye shall know them."\nEvery tree bears Its own kind of fruit.\nNature Is Inexorable In her laws as\nto this. One may search the universe\nIn vain for on exception to this law.

All\nfalse teachers shall he finally punished\nby being cast Into the fire. Although\nGod lias Infinite patience and bear?\nlong, he will see to it that this work\ndoes not go on forever. 1\nIII. The Danger* of Empty Profe*\n■Ion (vv. 21-23).\n1. Merely calling Christ “Lord” wll\nnot answer for doing his will.\n2. One may even do supernatura\nworks and not be saved (vv. 22, 23).\nNot all supernatural works are d\nvine. There is a supernatural worl\nof evil. It Is the business of ever\nbeliever to test the spirits (I Job\n4:1, 2).\n3. Separation from God (v. 23\nYou may be a Sunday school teach,\nor preacher, nnd even perform mar\nmighty works, as casting out devl!\nhealing the sick, and yet hear fro\nJesus Christ, the King, the awful de\nlaratlon "I never knew you, depu\nfrom me.”\nIV.
