William Templeman, Minister, of Mines nnd of Inland Revenue for, the Dominion of Canada, accompanied, by Mrs. Temploman and Mr. Nicholas, his private secretary, arrived in Ska*, ;vay last night and Balled for .Victoria, on tho Princess May. Mr. Templema, has just returned from a trip to Atlln,, Whitchorse and Dawson., "My trip north was purely for pleas, ore and recreation," said Mr. Tern, pieman yesterday. "I wanted to see, the country and as I am minister of, mines I naturally looked into the, mining Industry of the country. My, trip, however, has 110 official signifi, cance.", Mr. Templeman Raid that tho de, velopment work at Dawson wan not, sufficient to demonstrate whether, there was paying quartz prospects, there, but that development work, now under way would probably de, cide the question. He personally,, was of the opinion that Dawson will, have a future as a quartz camp. Mr., Templeman also referred to the great, Increase in the number of quartx, claims being staked., Jack Carr, who sailed south last, night on the City of Seattle with his, twin baby moose. has prospected Al, aska perhaps as thoroughly as any, man in the territory. He Is one of, the best informed men in Alaska and, his optnion is bound to carry weight., Mr. Carr, in an interview to The, Alaskan yesterday, stated that he was, firmly convinced that quartz would be, found in sufficient quantity and rich, ness around Fairbanks to Insure the, permanency of that camp., "There Is certainly quartz in the, Fairbanks district," said Mr. Carr., "Until the last year or two every, body was wiid about placer and no, one cared for quartz. But prospecting, bas shown the presence of quartz, and the development work done so, far has shown it to carry rich values., "A man named Marsh who was, grubstaked by Congressman Sulxer of, New York has located a quartz claim, on the Chandalar that la the richest, quartz I have ever seen. He lias a, four foot ledge of free milling gold, ore and if it doesn\'t pinch out it will, be a mint., "I wouldn\'t dare tell how high sonxi, of the assays have run., "In time I look to Bee the gradual d?, velopment of the whole Tauana val, ley and the tributary valleys. The, country is too rich not to progress., What is noeded most is a railroad, to the interior that will open up the, country.", OUNCE TONIGHT HI W. P.

D., F.R.S., president of the chem i, leal section of the British Associa, tion for the Advancement of Science,!, which began Its sessions here today., Professor Armstrong also expressed I, regret at what he called thi g.rowlng, tendency toward premature announce, ment of Incipient or aliened scien, tific discoveries., "Wo have been living in a tine of1, sensational discovery," he said, "In a!, period when advertisement Is favored, and the desire for notoriety rampant., Unhappily that caution that appeared, to be regarded as a priceless pre, logatlve of the scientific worker In, the earlier part of the last century Is, no longer our recognized watchword."\', Dr. Armatrong declared hi*. faith In, the progrew* of chemlatry toward aolv, In* tho problem* of life and no*.

That It can, support a population of three to six, millions Is an opinion resting upon, facts., Sixty miles beyond the arctic circle, the hardier garden vegetables, such, as potatoes, cabbage and cauliflower,, are already raised successfully. At, the farthest station of the Agricultur, al lVpartaMoit ? more than five hun, dred miles north of Sitka ? barley and, oats are brought to maturity every, year, and In normal years winter, wheat and rye. spring wheat and buc, wheat are harvested. Finland, sub, stantially in the same latitude, and!, with as cold a climate, has about, fifty thousand square miles of cultiv, able area, and supports a population, cf three millions. It is a fair argu, ment that Alaska can do at least, balf as well as Finland. Doing fully, a? well the t?-"ritory, with twice the, srsble area, would support six mil, lion people., Fur was the chief and almost the, only industry when we acquired the, territory. But as the fur trade de, clined the salmon industry arose ?, mounting from forty-three thousand, dollars in 1881 to ten million dollars, last year. Gold, at the present, is,, the most valuable product. Very pos, sibly, as agriculture and other indust, ries arise in the next fifty years,, gold will become relatively unimport, ant?Saturday Evening Post., ROMANCE AND REALITY., The maiden watched by her cottage, door for her lover, who came to her, aide no more. Such stories as this, have the poets told, since the world, >?as young that has now grown old., and the maids forsaken all drooped, and died, and over their couches the, bleak winds sighed; or, perad venture,, they lived for years, and sloshed, around ankle-deep in tears, leading, a life that was sad and strange, like, Mary Ann in her Moated Grange., Ob. bushels of stories like this are, found, of maidens poisoned and maid, ens drowned, or maidens brooding in, darkened halls, with tumbling turrets, and moldy walls; and ghosts of maid, ens whose loves broke up. are thick, as fleas on a yellow pup. The maid, en watched by her cottage door, for, her lover, who came to her side no, more; and she did not rail, and she, did not scoff, but gently murmured:, "The stuff U off! I\'ve drawn a lemo, in my bold Knight; for breach of, promise I\'ll cinch him tight. So off, I\'ll hie to the court alone, and soak, him for many a golden bone:" ? Walt, Mason., TO ROAST OR NOT TO ROAST., Y\'ot to roast this, or y\'ot to roast |, that, are the most frequently used, terms of advice that a newspaper, man receives. If we should roast ev, ery thiag that somebody thinks needs, It, there would be a killing In this, office with nobody left to write up, the virtuous deeds of the dear de, parted. A newspaper is not intended, to serve as a vehicle wherein to ex, press wrath and vituperation. Its only, legitimate occupation is to print the, news. If It printed only the good news, and suppressed the bad. the com, munity would soon be morally improve, ed. Such a newspaper can only be, hoped for when its readers talk good, things that have come under their ob, ation. A society has been organized, \\v hose members meet once a week for, the purpose of rerouting only the good, things that have come undre their ob, scrvatlon since their previous mooting, Not only are its members becoming, better, but they have surprised them, selves in discovering that there is, more of a pleasurable thrill in tell, ing or listening to a recital of a splet*, did (toed, than in the vulgar gossip of, the faults and frailties that encom, pass humankind. Try it some day., Try It for a week. Then you will un, derstand why roastiug is as distaste, ful as it is ineffectual as a system of, reform. ? Ketchikan Miner., OUR THANKS TO THEE. O, GLOOMY!, In behalf of the citizens of Skag, way, The Alaskan desires to thank, Gloomy Gus O\'Brien for his kind con, sideration in sending marked copies, of his paper containing an account of, the Indictment of Or. L. S. Keller to, nearly every man, woman and child, In Skagway. The Alaskan of the, day before published the proceedings,, but the Record had a few harrowing, details which no other papors had., Judging by the front page of his, paper, the indictment of I>r. Keller I, was to Gloomy Gus an event overshad, owing in Importance tho discovery of, the north pole., Whether or not Dr. Cook really, reached the" north pole will bo the, burning question for the next few, moons. It will be hard to prove he, didn\'t., It Is planned to have President, Diaz of Mexico moot President Taft, on a bridge over the Rio Grande, river.

One even, Ing while In the Eternal City, when, the queen of night was at the full, he, proposed to his wife that they gc, and view the ruin thus Illuminated J, Mrs. Raster refused. But ho persist, ed., Lcavinc his hotel on the Esqualine i, hill, he strolled down a broad thor- i, oughfare and soon stood on a height, overlooking the eastern end of tho, enormous theater of the Caesars. He, was surprised to note how Immense It !, looked under the different light. The, great pile, or the remaining two-thirds, of It, built by slaves 1,000 years ago. I, where gladiators had fought and, Christians had been torn to pleeos by ,, wild beasts, rose against the sky like, the dark silhouette of a mountain. Go- ,, lng around to the entrance, Mr. Baxter, went within the walls and saw anoth, er sight? the moonlight throwing the, upper portions of the interior into con, trast with the shadowy lower parts., Many visitors were there, but as the, hour was late they gradually departed. 1, Suddenly Mr. Baxter found himself, alone. To go out through the main en- ;, trance was to Increase the distance to \', his hotel. There were openings all, around tho oval, but not lighted. Nev, ertheless the fearless American con, cluded to make his exit by on?j of, them. It was very dark under the, archway through which he passed, es, pecially since that at that moment a, cloud rolled over the moon. Suddenly, he felt some one brush by him and a, cloth fly against his face. Ho had, heard that the members of the Inter, national I.eague of Pickpockets were, then working Rome and were used to, covering their victims\' faces with a j, newspaper when robbing tbem. and It, flashed upon Mr. Raster that he was, suffering robbery. Clapping his hand, to his pocket, he missed the porto, monnaie he usually carried there., Throwing his aruis around the person, who had passed him, he dragged him, back Into the arena. There he found, that he held a priest., "Ah. ha!" he cried. "So you thieves, resort to the priestly dress to commit, your depredations. But you can\'t fool, an American. I\'ll get my money back, or I\'ll break your back over one of, these stone walls.", Then came a volley of words like an, explosion of a Gatllng gun, but since, Mr. Raxter knew only two Italian, words, "dove sta" (where is), they pro, duced no effect upon him. Fie felt all, over the man\'s body to find his porte, monnaie, but found only 10 centessiml,, or 2 cents. Then, after giving the, fellow his opinion of him (In English),, telling him that he had been very dex, terous in passing his plunder to a dark, figure whose footsteps were to be, heard running away, Mr. Raxter re, membered that, after all. there were, only a few five lire bills In the porte- ,, monnaie. So he gave the thief a sound ;, drubbing and a final kick and started I, out of the ruin quite pleased that ho ,, had lost none of his youthful strength ,, or courage. The only fear he felt was, at a possibility of having to appear, In court against the robber. On arriv, ing at his hotel he told his adventuro, to his wife., "\\\\ hy, my dear, said Hint lady, I, have your pockotbook locked in the, trunk.", Thereupon Mrs. Raster unlocked the, Trunk and took out the pockotbook., "Well." s.\\ld Baxter meditatively, "I, downed him anyway.", There was a sharp rap at the door., Opening It. there stood two of the na, tional police In swallowtail coats,, white cord algulllettes, cocked (Napo, leon) hats and swords. Any one could, see by the serious expression of thetr, countenances that the dignity of the, Italian realm had been offended. Be, hind them stood a delicate, intellectual, ; looking priest, wiping scratches on his, face and forehead with a bloody hand, kerchief., j Mr. Baxter, marching between tho, ! officers of the law. was taken to the, ? police office, where, summoning: his, Italian vocabulary, he kept repenting:, "Dove sta the Americano consulato?" ?, Ills plea was finally heard, and he, was permitted to write a Hue to the, consul, who came, but whose influenco, availed nothing but to secure for the !, ! American who had maltreated an inof, fensive priest a fair trial. Baxter was, locked up., The next morning before the time \\, arrived for calling the case the consul i, visited the priest who had been as- j, sailed, and who proved to be a man ;, of Influence. The matter was ex- !, plaiued to the ecclesiastic, who listened, attentively. When the consul had fln- j, Ished, the Injured party said:, "Slgnore Baxter comes from a land, where there are a great many devoted j, sons of the church. Whether your ex, planation is correct or not I do not I, know, but if the matter was a mistake, I excuse It: if it was a wanton attack, I forgive it", A cab containing the consul and the, priest soon after drove up to the law, courts, and Mr. Baxter wa? released., HIGH PANS AT, CAHOON CREEK, Thomas Vogel, manager of tho Ca, hoon Creek Mining Co., arrived In, town Saturday leaving Tuesday. In, an Interview with a Plonwr Presa re, presentative Mr. Vogel stated that, every thing at the mine was moving, nicely and was surpassing expecta, tions. In speaking of the rich dirt,, Mr. Vogel told a little incident which, took place a few days ago. One of, the men noticed some dirt that seem, ed to carry some gold. Out of one, pan of this >15.25 was secured. Later, :n the evening another spot was notlc, ed out of which a single pan showed, a value of 167.25 which he said was, not taken off bedrock. ?
