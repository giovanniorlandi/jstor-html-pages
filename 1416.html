Great Britain nnd\nI Fra\'Sice. alono amounts to 1,050,313,\n000,000, an amount that baffles tho\nmost fertile imagination. But war\ndcos not only mean loss of life, bur\ndens of debt nnd taxation, Tt also\nbrlnga degeneration, bitter unliuns\nHob and burning desire for revenge.\nUndor nil this can ho seen one\nsrect fa,,t.--:dn, national sin. Tlio\ntuitions linvo long been transgress\ning God\'s laws, disobeying tho otor\nnal law that men should lovo one\nanother and bear ono another\'s bur\ndens. Tho nations in council at\nWashington must eomo Into a very\nroal face to face with their sins.\nThoro should be ropentanco. deep,\ngenuine and permanent.\nMay God prompt the Christian\npooplo of Barbourvllle to pray fer\nvently for the enthroning of good\nwill among men, the end of wild ex\npenditure of wealth for armaments\nand tor a real case of regeneration\namong the nations of the world.\nJOHN OWEN GROSS.\nFor local news read the Mountain\nAdvocate..\nnoi; islkvixs killed\nJerry Bowling Dies of Wounds\nOn Sunday afternoon shortly ho\nforo tho nrrlval of tho C.&M. train\nnt Unveil Hob Illcvlns had passed to\nthe great beyond with a bullet In\nhis hnart and Undo Jerry Bowling\nlay mortally wounded with a hole in\nhla abdomen. Tho alleged killer Is\nJoo Adklus, father of seven child\nren, formerly of Whitley County,\nbut who, for tho past few years.\nhas lived at Crlsa. It Is stated that\nwhiskey wns nt tho back of tho kill\ning that which has done so many\nmen to death Is this and surround\ning sections during tho past year.\nAdklus ls said to hnve been under\nthe Influence of liquor at the time.\nBowling was placed on the train\nand brought to the Logan Hospital\nbut died shortly after his arrival.\nSheriff B. P. Walker went to Crlss\non horseback on receipt of the news\nof the killing, first calling at the Ad\nkins home which he searched. He\nwas informed that Adklns was up\nthe road and on proceeding some\nlittle distance, he met Adklns carry\ning a revolver In his hand and his\nson who was carrying a shot gun.\nSheriff Walker explained his mission\nand Adklns handed over his revol\nver. Sheriff Walker then dismount\ned and searched Adklns taking pos\nsession of the shot gun.\nAdklns asked permission to go to\nthe house and was later brought In\nto town thru Bull Creek to avoid\nfurther trouble. Sheriff Walker ar\nrived at the Jail about 3:45 P.M.\nand turned his prisoner over to Sam\nLewis.\nAdkln\'s story was to the effect\nthat he had bought a quart of whis\nkey (moonshine) Sunday from Ble\nvlns and had also received a gun\nfrom him. He said that on leaving\nBlevln\'s place, Jerry Bowling called\nto him and that Blevlns began to\nlire. When ho raised his own pistol\nBowling stepped in between him and\nBlevlns and that this shooting was\naccidental. Blevlns, he said, then\nadvanced to arrest him and he took\ndeliberate aim for the heart and\nfired. The bullet found the exact\nmark and Blevlns tumbled over\ndead.\nAll of the men were under indict\nment for moonshlnlng or bootleg\nging, either in Knox Circuit Court\nor In the District Court at London.\nIt will be remembered that a\nmule was taken at the Fair Grounds\nIn September and was later sold as\nno one would assume ownership of\nthe mule or tho Jars of whiskey it\ncarried. Seme of these Jars were\n\'wrapped in a newspaper which bore\nlAflktna mimp One nf thfiso Is now\nin the Sheriff\'s possession.\nBlevlns was made deputy sheriff\nsome weeks ago on his promise to\nclean up moonshlnlng In his section.\nHe brought In several stills, report\ning an ambuscade on one trip In\nwhich the still was perforated by\nbullets. He stated that he and his\nparty drove tho attackers away.\nTho affair Is another evidence If\nIt be needed, that a quiet, sober life\npays. Liquor is getting several of\ntho good men in this city as It got\ntho three concerned in Sunday\'s af\nfair.\nI Men may not fool with it and ex-\npect to come out victorious. It Is\n\'as truly an enemy that steals away\ntho brains of men today as It was\nIn tho day of the wisest of men who\n\';.. bran led it.\n1 Sheriff Walker is to bo highly\n.(omir.pudcd on tlio quiet courago\n.that could meet a man who had\nj shortly before allot down two men\n\'and who approached htm with the\n! pistol in his hand. Wo certainly are\n1 fortunate In having a man of bis\ncallhro a? our Sheriff. It may bo not\nI oil that lie h as good a man after\n\'tho primary i.s lie was before in\nj spite of a hunch of dismal prognosi\nj tlcntors. Wliile his term of ofllco\nhas been short he will carry with\nhim tho admiration of his follow\nrltlzens who rccognlzo cool courage.\nMADE A RUN AT PINEVILLE\nJudgo W. It. Marseo. A. M. Dock\ner.

Murphy, director\nof the department of Expression at\nUnion College, appeared Tuesday\novenlng, Nov. 8th, In the College\nChapel giving several readings In a\nmost pleasing manner to a very ap\npreciative audience. Miss Murphy\nhas a well modulated, low pitched\nvoice that carries well. She pre\nsents her subject by Intonations\nrather than gesture.\nThe first group consisted of little,\nthoughtful sketches. "Homesick in\nEurope." by Henry VanDyke sounds\nthe note of love of country while\nKipling\'s "When Earth\'s Last Pic\nture Is Painted" gives the larger\nview of the real worth of earnest\nendeavor, and both were fittingly\nexpressed In Miss Murphy\'s Inter\npretation. The second group of dia\nlect sketches took a lighter vein and\nwere pleasing also in the manner\nin which they were rendered. The\nmonologue given as the last selec\ntion called for more action and one\ncould see the distress of the fliouse\nkeeper on trying to manage "Unex\npected Guests."\nIn assisting Miss Murphy Miss\nMae Carter, pianist of rare ability,\nappeared twice and responded to an\nencore. Miss Carter has a place of\nher own with Barbourvllle people\nwho always look for a treat from\nher perfectly drilled fingers.\nMiss Heger, who was at Union\nlast year, also assisted. She too has\nbecome a great favorite and her\n"Caro Nome" was enthusiastically\nreceived and an encore was demand\ned to Vhich she gractotfsly rtetrtma\ned. Miss Heger has an exception\nally clear, high soprano, her high\ntones always coming clear and dis\ntinct. Dr. Franklin. In presenting the\nprogram, voiced the opinion of the\npublic when he said that programs\nare presented from tho platform at\nU. C. that are very hard to excel.\nPerhaps tills is one reason we do\nnot become moro enthusiastic over\nour lyceum and Chautauqua num\nbers.

He was standing at the\nfront of tho storo near the gasollno\ntank when struck by a passing car,\nwhich ran In close to get ahead of\nono In front. The fender struck Mr.\ni Detherage who took a flight Into the\nlair. Ho went bo high that he had\n\'time to decide where to drop and so\nfell on tho Ford that struck him.\nHe was a bit skinned. Whether his\nproximity to tho gnsollao tank had\nsurcharged- him with gas and thus\nconverted him Into a lighter than\nair human machine, we leave to the\nscientists, but the fact that 0. B.\nIs a young man of considerable flta-\nture as well as avoirdupois com\nbined with his flight Into the ether\nwould seem to indicate that a gaso\nllno tank Is tho proper thing to be\n\'standing by when ono choses to be\nhit by a car. However, we do not\nadvise making a sport of the thing.\nSomeone might not be subject to In\nflation nnd thus get hurt.
