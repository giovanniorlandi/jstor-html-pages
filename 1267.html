        <pre>["Milestone in Peruvian History\nPERU'S PEACEFUL REVOLUTION\nBy HARRY B. MURKLAND\nEditor ond Specialist on Latin American Affairs\nI t  w o u l d  be difficult to imagine \na less revolutionary figure than \nthe SO-year-old Dr. Jose Luis \nBustamante Rivero, distinguished \nlawyer and diplomat by career, \nconservative Catholic democrat in \npolitics. But those who hailed his \nelection to the presidency of Peru \non June 10 as a peaceful revolu\xad\ntion were guilty of only slight ex\xad\naggeration. It marked the appar\xad\nent end of traditional rule by a \nsmall oligarchy of wealth and po\xad\nsition, and a first step toward pop\xad\nular government. So the prevailing \ndemocratic winds were felt in an\xad\nother Latin American country.\nPeru had not been- a personal \ndictatorship like some of its \nneighbors. There was little of the \ndictator in the will or character of \nthe well-intentioned, mild-man\xad\nnered Dr. Manuel Prado y Ugar- \nteche, President since 1939. But \nthere was equally little of true \ndemocracy in the country. The \nchurch, the army and the land\xad\nowning aristocracy ruled in their \nown interests and with little re\xad\ngard for the ignorant, poverty- \nridden Indians who made up the \nmass of the population.\nPeruvian politics were frequent\xad\nly lively but essentially meaning\xad\nless. The multitudinous “ parties” \nwere shifting groups of support\xad\ners of one leader or another rather \nthan well-defined, organized par\xad\nties. The most important excep\xad\ntion was Victor Raul Haya de la \nTorre’s A P R A  (Alianza Popular \nRevolucionaria Americana). This \nleftist (but not Communist) or\xad\nganization, which advocated Indian \nsupremacy, was extraordinarily \nsuccessful among the masses. It \nwas virtually outlawed in 1933 \nand was not permitted to run a \ncandidate in the 1936 presidential \nelection. Its votes, however, gave \nthe opposition candidate a major\xad\nity over the administration stand\xad\nard-bearer. But the ease with \nwhich the election was cancelled \nand President Oscar Benavides \n(Prado’s predecessor) continued \nin power was clear evidence of the \nstrangle-hold, which the oligarchy \nmaintained on the government. \nA PR A  continued to operate un\xad\nderground. Prado’s election in \n1939 was another machine job.\nIt was against this background \nthat Peru approached the 1945 \nelections. The Constitution forbade \nDr. Prado to run again, and it had \nin any case been obvious for some \ntime that his chief desire was to \nfinish his term and go in peace. \nHe assured the country that he \nmeant to see to it that his suc\xad\ncessor was chosen by the free \nvote of the electorate. Peruvians \nwere not impressed. They were \nnot accustomed to, and did not \nexpect, free elections. And skep-\n94\n", "PERU’S PEACEFUL REVOLUTION 95\ntics noted that every attempt to do \naway with the oppressive decrees \nwhich controlled the press, poli\xad\ntical parties, public gatherings and \nfreedom of speech had been beaten \ndown by the large administration \nmajority in Congress.\nBut new forces were at work in \nPeru. Industrialization of parts of \nthe country had brought new \nskills and a modicum of education \nto some of the Indians. Embryonic \nlabor unions had increased the \ncurrent of ideas. The Apristas \nwere working steadily on the \nawakening masses and the demo\xad\ncratic propaganda of the United \nNations was having an effect.\nThe result of all this was a po\xad\nlitical stirring. The ruling group \nwas obviously aware of it: the \noppressive decrees were not with\xad\ndrawn but neither were they en\xad\nforced with any great strictness.\nPolitical ferment increased \nweek after week, but there were \nstill no avowed presidential candi\xad\ndates. It was fairly clear, however, \nthat the administration forces \nmeant to put forward Gen. Eloy G. \nUreta, former Chief of Staff. He \nwould be a strong candidate.: he \nwas S3 years old, a professional \nsoldier with a distinguished rec\xad\nord who had never been involved \nin politics and who seemed to have \ncomparatively liberal ideas. For \npopular appeal, he had been the \nhero of Peru’s frontier war with \nEcuador at the beginning of the \ndecade. Against this was the char\xad\nacter of his backers. “ Well inten- \ntioned but badly surrounded,”  \ncritics called him. His candidacy \nwas launched officially on March \n17 by a coalition of conservative\ngroups and parties which called \nitself the National Union.\nDuring the same month a fan\xad\ntastic assortment of opposition \ngroups, united as the National \nDemocratic Front, nominated Dr. \nBustamante, who was at the time \nAmbassador to Bolivia.\nDr. Bustamante was one of the \nmost distinguished figures in \nPeruvian public life. Educated in \nJesuit schools and an earnest Cath\xad\nolic, he early demonstrated his de\xad\nvotion to democracy. He fought \nthe dictatorship of Leguia (1919- \n1930) and has been called the in\xad\ntellectual author of the revolution \nwhich ousted him. Sanchez Cerro, \nLeguia’s successor, made Busta\xad\nmante his Minister of Justice, but \nBustamante resigned and returned \nto the teaching of international \nlaw at the University of Arequipa \nwhen Sanchez Cerro in turn set \nhimself up as dictator. He later \nentered the diplomatic service and \nwas Ambassador to Uruguay and \n(twice) to Bolivia.\nTHE PEOPLE'S PARTY\nThe forces which rallied behind \nBustamante ranged all the way \nfrom reactionary groups with per\xad\nsonal grievances against the ad\xad\nministration to Communists. Most \nimportant of them all was the \nA P R A , which now called itself \nthe People’s Party. The A PR A  \nhad lost strength since 1931 and \nsome doubtful elements had en\xad\ntered it, but it was still probably \nthe largest political group in Peru \nand its support virtually assured \nBustamante’s election— if the vote \nwere cast freely and counted fair\xad\nly-\n", '96 CURRENT HISTORY, AUGUST, 1945\nAnother notable member of the \nBustamante forces was the legen\xad\ndary and unpredictable Marshal \nBenavides. Once the iron-handed \ndictator of Peru, the originator \nof most of the oppressive laws \nwhich threatened to cripple Bus\xad\ntamante’s campaign, and the im\xad\nplacable foe of the A PR A , he now \nrefused to run for President him\xad\nself, gave strong support to the \ncivilian Bustamante against the \nArmy candidate, Ureta, and lay \ndown like a lamb with the newly \nbaptized People’s Party. Not to \nbe outdone, the Apristas hastened \nto applaud the old Marshal. \n(Marshal Benavides died on July \n2.)\nThe campaign was a hot one. \nMost of the big Lima newspapers \nsupported Ureta. (A  notable ex\xad\nception was La Prensa, original \nproposer of his candidacy, which \nswung over to Bustamante on \nMay 19 because of dissatisfaction \nwith Ureta’S congressional slate.) \nBut many small opposition sheets \nwere born to scream back at the \nestablished press. “ Creole Nazi- \nFascists”  was one of the milder \nepithets hurled at the Ureta party, \nwhile the journals of the National \nUnion pictured the conservative \nCatholic Bustamante as a front for \nCommunism.\nAs the campaign progressed, it \nbecame apparent that President \nPrado had meant what he said \nwhen he promised a free election. \nThe administration forces got \nevery break, of course, and the op\xad\nposition had to contend with many \nmore or less minor annoyances. \nBut there was no serious inter\xad\nference with the Bustamante cam\xad\npaign and every party in the \ncountry, including the previously \noutlawed Apristas (People’s \nParty) was allowed to speak its \npiece.\nThis encouraged the opponents \nof the administration. They still \nkept their fingers crossed, how\xad\never. The campaign was all very \nwell. But the casting and counting \nof the votes would really tell the \nstory.\nBy this time the campaign had \nalso acquired an international as\xad\npect. Little Ecuador was afraid of \nthe “ heroe de Zarumilla,”  as his \npropagandists called Ureta. And \nwhen his over-enthusiastic army \nfollowers, talked of still more \n“ glorious”  conquests for Peruvian \narms, Ecuadorans began to won\xad\nder if all Peru’s territorial desires \nhad been satisfied. Bolivia, Chile \nand Colombia, neighbors of Peru, \nwere also anxious, for so much \npolitical heat had been generated \nthat an attempt to count out Busta\xad\nmante would almost certainly \nmean revolution, and revolutions \nare not always respecters of fron\xad\ntiers.\nBut Prado remained firm in his \napparent determination to finish \nhis term honorably and with full \ncredit It is more difficult to un\xad\nderstand why the reactionary \nforces behind him put up so little \nfight. Perhaps it was so obvious \nthat tampering with the elections \nwould bring on revolution, that \nthey dared not take the risk.\nBe that as it may, the vote was \nas fair and free as the campaign \nhad been. So was the count of \nvotes. It proceeded slowly, for the\n', "PERU’S PEACEFUL REVOLUTION 97\nballot boxes had to be brought to \nthe state capitals for counting, in \nmany cases from remote and al\xad\nmost inaccessible Andean villages. \nBustamante’s seven-to-three lead, \nestablished as the first trickle of \nballots came in, was maintained \nsteadily and his election was cer\xad\ntain. Two Vice Presidents and a \nfull Senate and House of Repre\xad\nsentatives were also chosen. In\xad\ncomplete returns indicated that \nBustamante supporters had won \nlarge majorities in both houses, \ngiving the new President adequate \nlegislative support for his policy.\nW H A T  NEXT?\nPeru had succeeded, then, in \nelecting a truly popular, democrat\xad\nic government for the first time in \nits history. The next question was, \nwhat would that government do? \nIn spite of the campaign charges \nof his opponents, Bustamante is \nanything but a leftist. His gen\xad\neral intentions would probably \nadd up to something like this: a \ngreater measure of democracy, \nperhaps a slight shift toward the \nleft of center, and concentration \non the economic and social devel\xad\nopment of the country for the \nbenefit of the country as a whole \nand not only of a small owning \nclass. It is significant that the \nApristas,’ the largest organized \nbody supporting Bustamante, are \ncurrently stressing national de\xad\nvelopment rather than socialism. \nSpeaking at a great Bustamante \nrally in Lima on May 20, Haya de \nla Torre had declared:\n“ It has been alleged that we un\xad\nderstand social justice as a total \npartition of the property of those\nwho have wealth. Although it \nmay appear unbelievable, there \nare not lacking ingenuous persons \nstill convinced that we have a \nEuropean concept of 'the parti\xad\ntion of wealth. That is not true. \nIn Europe there exists the phe\xad\nnomenon of population saturation. \nIn dealing with densely populated \ncountries, all socialistic plans must \ninclude the partition of existing \nwealth. But that is not the his\xad\ntoric space-time problem of JPeru.\n. . . W e must mobilize the creative \nforces of Peru. W e must produce \nmore and consume more. And it is \nimperative to dynamize and vita\xad\nlize production, giving the pro\xad\nducer democratic dignity and the \nmaterial and spiritual benefits of \ncivilization to which he has a « \nright.”\nShortly after the election Busta\xad\nmante made it clear that his diag\xad\nnosis of Peru’s immediate prob\xad\nlems was not too different from \nthat of the Apristas. Again the \nemphasis was on production. Eco\xad\nnomic problems will receive his \nfirst attention, Bustamante told the \nUnited Press on June 26. His \nchief objectives: increased pro\xad\nduction, particularly of foodstuffs; \na realistic, scientific budget; en\xad\ncouragement of productive invest\xad\nment of several million dollars of \nprivate capital now immobilized \nin banks. H e would prefer, the \nPresident said, to see idle capital \ninvested in agriculture, especially \nin irrigation works, “ although \nthere are some manufacturing in\xad\ndustries in need of a vitalizing in\xad\njection of capital.”  Large-scale ex\xad\nploitation of the country’ s coal \nresources will also be pushed.\n", '98 CURRENT HISTORY, AUGUST, 1945\nBustamante favored revision of \nthe tax system to attract private \ncapital, both Peruvian and for\xad\neign, and establishment of a new \ndirect income tax. He denied that \nhis government would attempt to \nbreak up large privately-owned \nestates but said it would try to \nprevent the creation of such es\xad\ntates in the future. “ W c arc not \ngoing to divide anybody’s lands \nor properties but to stimulate the \ncreation of new and small proper\xad\nties for the workers of the fields, \nwho will own their small parcels \nnext to the big estates, freeing \nthem from having to depend on\nwages and enabling them to im\xad\nprove their standard of living by \ntheir own initiative.”  The Presi\xad\ndent-elect thought existing labor \nlegislation adequate for the pro\xad\ntection of the workers, but he said \nhe would seek more protection \nfor the white-collar middle class. \nFinally, Dr. Bustamante announced \nthat one of his first acts would be \nto abolish the censorship over news, \none of the harshest in South Amer\xad\nica.\nIf Bustamante follows through \non his liberal program, his election \nwill be a milestone in Peruvian \nhistory.\nFrance needs "another \nindustrial revolution’’\nA NEW ECONOMY FOR FRANCE\nBy HENRY SIMON BLOCH\nInstructor In Economics, University of Chicago\nT h e  French economic system is \ndisrupted. New institutional forms \nare emerging. The food shortages, \nthe manpower problems, the trans\xad\nportation crisis, the physical de\xad\nstruction of large areas and the \nlack of fertilizer and farm machin\xad\nery are matters of public knowl\xad\nedge. W e are better informed on \nthe actual economic situation than \nwe are on plans and blueprints \nunderlying the present and future \nre-organization.\nFrance does not have an of\xad\nficial economic program. There is \nno generally accepted Four Year \nPlan or Five Year Plan, although \nseveral have been advanced by \nprivate individuals in the name \nof groups and parties. What is the \nmould of the economic system that \n.is to evolve out of chaos, war and\nexploitation by a ruthless enemy? \nThe period of transition from war \nto peace finds a bleeding economy, \nstruggling in dreadful convulsions, \ncomplicated by the presence of an \narmy, which, albeit it is a friendly \none, adds to the economic prob\xad\nlems.\nThe crystallization of the fluid \nforms cannot take shape before the \nnew constitution is written and the \nconstitution cannot be written be\xad\nfore the general elections are held. \nFor France, like the United \nStates, is a democracy. This does \nnot mean that the French govern\xad\nment is standing by inactively \npracticing a laissez faire policy. \nSome definite efforts are being \nmade, such as the calling in of \nthe old banknotes, the floating of \na new loan on a life rent basis, the\n']</pre>
