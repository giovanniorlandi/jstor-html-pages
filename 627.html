If\nthe Commission decides the location according to the fit\nness and the best interests of the people for whom the\nnew school is established West Liberty will get it .\n" From the statistics, prepared by the State Board of\nHealth and the Department of Education, West Liberty\nhas the lowest death rate of any of the contending towns,\nMorgan county has the greatest percentage of school at\ntendance, based upon the census, save the county\n. of Elliott, of any in the State and the two counties had only\na difference of two per cent. .\nThe envoirnment that would surround the school here\nis the best of any asking for it. Morgan is the -only\ncounty asking for the school that has a farming population\nwith sufficiently fertile lands to support the school in the\nway of producing food stuffs and milk and butter.\nThe county is situated in the center of the section for\nwhich the school is intended and West Liberty can be\nreached by more people of the various mountain cou i\nties in less time and at less coslihan can any other point\nasking for the school.\nA circle with a radius of 35 miles, with West Liberty\nas the center, covers practically all the counties in the\ngroup for whom the school is intended. A like circle,\nwith the center at any of the other towns, reaches into\nOhio and West Virginia and Virginia\nIn all the towns save Morehead the circle would ex\ntend with more than half its area into other states.\nThere is no good reason why the school should not\nbe located at West Liberty, and there are scores of good\nreasons why it should not be located at any of the other\ntowns asking for it.\nIf the Commission is disposed to consider the matter\n"as impartially as a committee of uninterested men, abso\nlutely unacquainted with the situation and free to decide\n\'without bias, we will receive the entire eight votes on\nfirst ballot in the deliberation of the Commission, and we\nare relying upon the Commission acting as though they\nknew nothing of the situation save from the showing made\nby the contestants. In other words we are. expecting a\n. fair trial of our case and know that we will eet the school\nif that is done.

The road spirit in the county is fine, and all the\npeople..want is to have a leadership that is aggressive and\nprogressive. The posple want roads and want them now.\n\'. and they, are growing restive under the delay that is wholly\nunnecessary.

Every\nfarmer in-the county should seek the aid of Mr. Rankin\nenct receive the benefits of his work. He is glad to ex\ntend the work to all who will receive it, and his work\nhas brought great improvement to the county. This has\ntaken time, it is true. Mr. Bowles started the interest and\n. \'Mr. Rankin has followed it up, and now there is scarcely\nfarmer in the county who does not want the work continued..-\nIf yo\'u have not consulted the farm agent in your\ntroubles do so.

It had jeeiucj to. Countauce\n1. m\nI ft\nand her father,\' therefore, that it must\nhave been some Intimate and private\nevent. .\nUncle Benny had withdrawn him\nself from men; he had ceased to be\nactive In his business and delegated It\no others.. This change hud been\nstrangely advantageous to Henry.\nHenry had been hardly more than a\ncommon seaman then. He had been a\nmate the mate on one of Uncle Ben\nny\'s ships. Quite suddenly he had\nbecome Uncle Benny\'s partner. Henry\nhad explained this to her by saying\nthat Uncle Benny had not trusted\nHenry; he had been suspicious of\nhim ; he had quarreled with htm. How\ns\'.range, then, that Uncle Benny should\nhave advanced and given way to a\nman whom he could not trust I\nUncle Benny had come to her and\nwarned her not to marry Henry; then\nhe bad gent for Alan. There had been\npurpose In these acts of Uncle Ben\nny\'s; had they meant that Uncle Ben\nny hnd been on the verge of making\nexplanation that explanation which\nHenry feared and that he had been\nprevented? Her father had thought\nthis; at least, he had thought that\nUncle Benny must have left seme ex\nplanation In his house. He bad told\nAlan .hnt, and had given Alan \' the \'\nkey to the house so that he could\nfind It. Alan had gone to the house\nIn the house Alan had found\' some\none who had mistaken blm for a\nghost, a man who had cried out at\nsight of him something about a ship\nabout the Mlwaka, the ship of whose\nloss no one had known anything ex\ncept by the soundings of the Drum.\nWhat had the man been doing In the\nhouse T Had he too been looking for\nthe explanation the explanation that\nHenry feared? Alan had described\nthe man to her; that description had\nnot had meaning for her before; bat\nnow remembering that description she\ncould think of Henry as the only one\nwho could have been In that house!\nHenry had fought with Alan there I\nAfterwards," when Alan had been at\ntacked upon the street, had Henry\nanything to do with that?\nHenry had lied .o her about being\nIn Duluth the night he had fought\nwith Alan; he had not told her the\ntrue cause of his quarrels with Uncle\nBenny ; he had wished her to. believe\nthat Uncle Benny was dead when the\nwedding ring and watch came to her\nthe watch which had been Captain\nS\'aff or"d\'S of the Mlwaka I Henry had\nurged her to marry him at once. Was\nthat because he wished the security\nthat her father and she must give\nher husband when .they learned the.\nrevelation which Alan or Uncle Ben\nny might bring?\nAt Petoskey she went from the train\ndirectly to the telegraph office. If\nHenry was In Petoskey, hey would\nknow at that office where he could be\nfound ; he would be keeping In touch\nwith them.\nMr. Spearman, the operator said, had\nheen at the office early In the day;\nthere had been no message for htra;\nhe had left Instructions that any\nwhich came were to be forwarded o\nhim through the men who\', under his\ndirection, were patrolling the shore\nfor twenty miles north of Little Trav\nerse, watching for boats.\nCbnstance crossed the frozen edges\nof the bay by sledge , to Harbor\nPoint Her distrust now had deep\nened to terrible dread. She bad not\nbeen able before this to form any dell\nntte Idea of how Henry ceuld threat\nen Alan and Uncle Benny; she hnd\nImagined only vague Interference and\nobstruction of the search for them;\nshe had not foreseen that he could so\nreadily assume charge of the search\nand direct or misdirect, t.\nAt: the rolnt she discharged the\nsledge and went on foot to the house\nof the caretaker who had charge of\nthe Sherrlll cottage during the winter.\nGetting the keys from him, she let\nherself Into the house. Oolng tp her\nroom, she unpacked a heavy sweater\nand. woolen cap and short (ur \'coat-v.\n\'winter tilings which were left there\nagainst use- when they, opened the\nhouse sometimes out of season and\nput them on.

She went\nout then, arid fastened on her snow-\nshoes. \'\nConstance hurried westward and\nthen north, following the bend of the\neuore. The figure of a man one of\nthe shore patrols pacing tho Ice hum\nmocks of the bench and stnrlng out\nupon the lake, appeared vaguely . In\nthe . dusk, when she hnd gone about\ntwo miles.

She descended to the\nbench again and went on; her gaze\ncontinued to smirch the hike, but now,\nwherever, there was a brenk In the\nbluffs, she looked toward the shore as\nwell. At the third of theso breaks,\nthe yellow glow of a window appeared,\nmarking a house In a hollow, between\nnow-shrouded hills. She turned en\ngeily Unit wny; she cou!d go only\nvery slowly now.

It was said about the Capitol during the last ses\nsion of the Legislature lhat the Jocky Club could fiet any\nlegislation passed it wanted and prevent any that it op\nposeu. u mat were true men it nas inaeea oecome a aan-\ngerous factbr in the state\'s politics.\nV"\'- G - . - .\n,The Jocky Club has amone its members some, of the\nmost asture politicians of the State, and hy appointments\nand by the distribution of its wnnings from its gambling\nhas tied to it some of the strongest elements in politics in\nboth political parties. Its policy seems to be that hi or\nder to perpetuate its franchise for gambling it must domi\nnate the entire legislative machinery of the State.- It is\nsaid that in order to do this it contributes impartially to\nall candidates for the Legislature Republicans and Dem\nocrats alike and trys to use them in every thing that\ncomes up. , . -. -.\n. G\nThe story that it rives to the Dublic is that it irf the\nfostering power behind a great industry the breeding of\nrace; hprses. But when the matter is sirranered down to\nthe real facts, of what use. is the\'race herse except to\nrace? He is not a good carriage horse, not a good work\nhorse and not a good saddle horse. He is useful only to\nracing, and racing is no.t possible according to its dfr-\nvotees except by reason of the gambling. It is an indus\ntry supported solely for the purpose of gambling. It con\ntributes not a thing to the world\'s good, but adds.much to\ntne degradation ol the people. - . .". - -.\ng . : \'\ni The millions that the Jockv Club trets from thp\'ra\ntraqk dupes is used in part to prevent the growth of senti-\n-mailt- norAirtnt Tli fU......

The nrintiner of nlav\n. ing cards is a large industry and at least two concerns in\nthe United btates have large capital. invested m that in\ndustry. \'The card printing business is as -important and\nas useful to the public as the race horse breeding, industry.\nnenner, are neeuea except ior tne sport they produce, \'\nn \'\nWhen the gambling interests got hold of sonv playi\ners in the big league of base ball, and bought them to\nthrow the world series, there was a howl from one end p\nthe country to the other and the . players who sold ou\n- were banished from the game. Do any of the dupes who\nhtt?nd the track and bet on the horses imagine that the\ngamblers do not have the races fixed? Do they imagine\nthaj there is a chance in a million to win?

"Don\'t interfere with the \'Sport, of the Kings\'.\' is\nthe cry of the horsemen. What they mean is "Do no\ninterfere . with our gambling." Kings are not; popular\nnow, and gambling is a curse. If the purses .offered for\n, the winners and the pride in rearing a winner is. not suf\nficient to induce the breeding of race, horses the industry\nis not worth the effort. Fine cattle and nogs are bred\nwithout the incentive of gambling, and if the; rtfce horse\niS-fi useful animal why can\'t he be bred according to the\nldqa of breeding fine cattle? The argument of the rac\ning people will not stand the test. . .\nG , \'\nOne reason why the daily newspapers of the Stated\nare not opposing the race track gambling is that many\nof the owners of the dailies are stockholders in the Joc-cy\nClub. .They are financially interested in the gambling\nand as a matter of selfishness, will not lift their voice\nTV against it But the daily newspapers are not the big in\nfluence in Kentucky. If the country press were to wnitp\nin a fight against the race track gambling Ihey could so\nexpose the thing that it would be abofiflherf. I dn nnf\nbelieve that the advertising the JbckV Club is tfointr is\nsufficient excuse for the country newspapers to remain si\nlenj upon the question of legalized gambling. I don\'t be\nlieve that the country press is ior sale or that it can be\nbought . . , v\nG "\ni One of our country exchanges had an editorial a\nfew weeks ago pointing to the fact that the Jocky Club\nwas forcing the issue and that sooner or later it would\nbe put up to the people squarely as an issue in electing tir\n.
