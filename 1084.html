An aged watch\nman\'s faithful performance of his du\nty even when death was threatened,\nprevented a robbery early today which\nif it had been successful, those famil\niar with the case, say would have\ncaused a sensation almost \'a great as\nthat which followed the looting of the\nManhattan bank, many years ago.\nRichard F. Gray, a watchman in the\nCentury building, at seventy-fourth\nand Broadway, near the center of the\nfinancial district, was the hero. He\nIs now In the hospital, Buffering from\nwounds which he received in a desper\nate single handed fight against two\nrobbers who attacked him while he\nwas making his rounds on the 19th\nfloor of the building, after midnight.\nAlthough sixty years old, Gray made\na determined fight against his assail\nants, and it was not until he had been\nbattered until almost unconscious\nthat he was overcome. Even then he\nrefused to reveal to the robbers the\nhiding place of the keys to hundreds\nof offices in the great building. In\ntheir desperation, tiie robbers chloro\nformed the man as he lay bleeding on\nthe floor, then began a systematic\nsearch of the lower portions of the\nbuilding for .the keys. , Apparently\nthey were unsuccessful in their search,\nfor when Gray revived and staggered\ndown nineteen flights of stairs to the\nbasement, the men had dissappeared.\nGray gave a good description of his\nassailants. A detective who had talk\ned with Gray, is of the opinion that a\nclerk at one time employed in the\nbuilding, was the instigator of the\nattempted robbers, and that his com\npanion was a expert bank thief.\n. "If these men had gotten the keys\nfrom the watchman," said the detect\nive, "they would have done a job that\nwould have made the Manhattan bank\nrobery look like a cheap affair. They\nwere after one safe in that building\nand that was all they wanted. They\nknew that securities in that safe were\nworth untold thousands."\nOil Notes.\nOil reports received at the oflice of\nStarr & Patten show drilling oppera\ntions yesterday as follows:\nRiley Oil Company, Lottie Mont\ngomery, No. 1, in section 4, tp 21, r 17,\nshot 80 quarts glycerins aud starts off\nat 400 barrels.\nNathaniel Riley No. 8, sec. 4, tp 24,\nn, r 17, was shot yesterday and starts\noff at 2C0 barrels.\nWillard Oil Company, sec. 4, tp 24,\nn, r 17, Joseph Riley, No. 8, shot yes\nterday and starts off at 150 barrels.\nJoseph Riley, No. 14, is drilling\nthrough the sand, making an excel\nlent showing.\nMissouri Mining Company, drilled\nin No. 3 on W.

The cat\nhouse itself is made of tar paper, being\na temporary structure, and when the\nhail fell it beat through the roof, caus\ning the death of White Faun, the big\nwhite pussy of them all.\nWhite Faun wa3 lying in a box di\nrectly under the center of the roof.\nThe other aristocratic cats were play\ning about the yard. When the hail\nbegan Mr. and Mrs. Hill ran to their\nrescue, but poor White Faun lay ex\nposed to the death-dealing Hows of\nthe immense hailstones. When tho\nproprietors of the cattery came back\nthey found White Faun lying lead.\nShe wa3 valued at $150.\nTobacco in Porto Rico.\n"Within a very short time tobacco\nwill be as important, a product of Porto\nRico as sugar is now," says FYancis\nJ. Dexter of San Juan. "Many of the\nlarge plantations have taken up the\nraisiug of tobacco, with the result\nthat tho output of the leaf has in\ncreased many fold. Many Americans\nwho have gone to the Island have in\nvested in tobacco rather than in\nsugar lands, and the consequence has\nbeen a rapid advance in the price of\nground suitable for tobacco raising.\nThis boom iu the tobacco industry will\nnot Injure the sugar business, how\never. We are producing more sugar\nnow than ever before and will con\ntinue to increase the production."\nTrade In Condsnied Milk..\nThe production of condensed Milk\nIn the United States is of compara\ntively recent origin.

The amount sold In 1900\nreached 187,000,000 pounds, and at the\npresent time, no doubt, the production\nIs still larger.\nLinking Europe and Asia.\nThe newest scheme for an electric\nrailway is a link between Europe and\nAsia.

Young Snow is\njust In time to avert the mayor\'s tine\nbut not tho mayors wrath.\nBUT AN IN 1908-\nA systematic effort is being\nmade, in interested quarters to\nencourage the delusion that if\nWilliam J. Bryan is nominated\nfor president next year he is fore\ndoomed to defeat, says the\nOmaha World-Herald.\nTo reasonable and intelligent\nmen, who know from whence\nthese stories emanate, what in\nspires them, what lies behind\nthem, what men are hidden in\nthe woods directing the cam\npaign of detraction, ridicule and\ndrivil, there could be no better\nproof of Bryan\'s strength. He\nis one of tho few public men to\nlove because of tho enemies he\nhas made, and to be respected\nbecause of the depth and inten\nsity of their fear of him. Such\nenemies as Bryan has made do\nnot turn all their batteries on the\nforlorn leader of a lost hope.\nWriting in the Buffalo Times\nJohn Sayles attempts to sho-v,\nfrom recent history, that "today\nBryan is the most popular Dem\nocrat in the United States," and\nthat he "can poll a million more\nvotes than any other candidate\nthe Democratic party can name."\nHe makes a convincing showing\nby comparing the Bryan vote in\n181H5 with the Democratic vote in\n1894, and again by comparing\nBryan\'s vote in WOO with Judge\nParker\'s vote in the humiliating\ncampaign of 1904. And there\ncan be no doubt that Bryan, in\n1KH, when he polled a million\nmore votes than any Democrat\never polled before, was a stronger\ncandidate than any other his\nparty could have named.\nThe question to consider at this\ntime is whether Bryau is stronger\ntoday or weaker than he was in\n1MH) and 1900.\nAnd here the argument and\nevidence is overwhelmingly one\nway. It is strange that any men\nshould be able to shut their eyes\nto the tremendous revolution\nthat has been wrought in the po\nlitical sentiment of this country\nsince Bryan last ran for presi\ndent, It is strange that\nthere are any who fail to grasp\nho moanini? of the fact that\nwhereas Bryan\'s views were un\npopular with a majority of the\nvoters in his views today\nare overwhelmingly dominant.\nMr. Bryan\'s bitterest enemies,\nwhen thev speak of him in then\nrlrwott\'d conferences in New\nYork, u.se strong language be\ncause "the country has gone mad\nwith Brvanisin" who does not\nit? Even a Republican national\nndministration is "tainted" with\nit. Every state west of the Al\nlecheries is ablaze with Bryan\nism. Just recently the country\nwitnessed the -strange spectacle\nLet every person in Craig couuty\nstrive during the coming year with a\nthought of a Drize-winninp: exhibit in\nwav of the third term and what mind and the result will be seen and\nway oi uio tuiui lMa;itJfelt by the entire county, whether\nHenry Watterson is pleased to , y\nnoil "\'tho Mp.xicanization oi tne.\nrepublic."

He is t he largest\nof the rodent tribe, and lias harsh,\ncoarse hair.more like bristles than fur.\nThis iiair is mixed black and yellow,\nof dingy appearance. In Ills native\nhaunts the capybara has a huge, rat\nston ac , which almost dras on t he\naround He Is a water loving animal\nand can dive and stay under for eight\nor leu minutes at a time.

He was once called the hydro-\nchoerus, or water-dog and lives on a\nvegetable diet.\nEvery attempt heretofore made to\nsecure one of these animals for exhibi\ntion p irposes has been unsuccessful,\nas death followed captivity.
