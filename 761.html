M., on last Sun\nday and hiked our happy way down\npast the depot and Feed stores which\nfestoone the highway whaton we\nhad to do the wending; we brought\nup with a jerk in our spavined leg\nat a gateway wherein stood a likely\nlookin yuoth busily growi a Chaplin\nunder his nose, and his north paw\nstuck out for stray quarters. After\nrunnin the gauntlet of the pay-asyou\nenter-sentries, we got into the main\nslaughter pen and found standin’\nroom only, (See, Red, they ain’t got\nnothing Use to sit on, and you wood\nnot sit if they offered you a rocker)\nwe picked out a lump of dirt what\nlooked higher than its neighbors and\nstarted to keep our dignity and not\nget flustered nor excited—but\nshucks, Red, they ain’t no use, bo,\nfor pretty soon the gladiators got\nline up for the fray and some guy\nstarted to callin all the numbers\nwhats in th e rithmatic and the hole\ndern gang went at\' each other like\nthe helbent on murder or somethin.\n1 looked around to see if they was a\nNero somewhere with his thumbs\ndown, but I could not locate him.\nWell, all the however, them athletics\nwas showin the stuff what young\nAmerica’s made of, and the oppos\ning team begun to soon find out that\nsomebody’s steered em up against a\nstove.

A\nguy what was standin there tella me\nthe names of some of them heroes,\nhim and me gets up a converse and\nhe says: “See that thing that looks\nlike a white streak over there?” I\nsays, “yes” what is it? Smoke? “No\nmister, ihat> Cricket Keiffer makin\na run.’* Just at that time I see the\nCricket throw the bail to another\nguy: “Look, he’s handin his gravy\nto Gex!” Sure pop, he hands the\npigskin over and Walt buries it be\nhind the line for a “touch-down.”\nWhat did the rube do, says I? The\nkid looks at me for a spell and says:\n“That’s the MAN i n him, bo, he’s in\nthe game for the gamesake and wont\ncrab anything on a hero line.” Just\nat that time, old man, Jupe Pluve\nupset hi s waterbucket and the crowd\nstreaked for cover.

When I had time to read\nof the work of other men, the results\nof feed composition and experimental\nfeed trials, 1 took from these expe\nriences what I thought practical for\nme to follow, and the results, though\nnot exceptional, have been the natural\nresults of good blood and good feed.\nOne of my boars, farrowed in April\nseveral years ago, weighed 165 pounds\nthe following September. At sixteen\nmonths he weighed 606 pounds, at\ntwenty-eight months 850 pounds, and\nthe following fall 1,015 pounds. This\nboar was one In a lot of 15, as uni\nform a bunch as I ever saw. Others\ngrew Into 600 and 800 pound hogs\nunder farmers’ care."\n“In addition to good lines,” he adds,\n“care and the right kind of feed are\nimportant means of preventing under\nsized animals, but the most important\nof all Is the man with the feed basket,\nfor It Is *tbe eye of the master that\nfatteneth his cattle.’ So far as runts\nlllminats All Females That Are Not\nGood Mothers to Prevent Appear\nanos of Runts in Litters.\nare concerned, I have never found It\nprofitable to raise them under any\ntreatment I have seen lota of ‘be\nfore and after* taking* illustrations oo\npaper, but not in the feed lot”\nSCRUB PIGS ARE EXPENSIVE\nVirginia Farmer Finally Convinced\nThat Purebreds Are Moat\nProfitable Animats.\nTbs county agent of Page county,\nVirginia, tried last summer to per\nsuade a farmer In his territory to keep\npurebred bogs. The man was diffi\ncult to convince. At the time of the\nargument the boys’ pig-club contest\nfor the year was Just starting. De\nspite the arguments which the connty\nagent made in favor of purebred stock,\nthe man went ahead and bought foor\nscrub pigs, saying he did not think\nthe boys’ club would do any better\nthan those he had purchased. He\nbought his pigs a month after the club\ncontest started, and gave them the\nbest of attention. He butchered hla\nhogs In January, this year, and the\nlargest weighed 175 pounds gross. The\nnrlze winner In the pig club weighed\n.\'!.°o pounds, and was fed only a lit\ntle over five months. This farmer la\nj mv Trying to buy •Home purebred bogs,\noTtr! declares his scrubs cost him more\nthan twice the amount the meat they\nproduced would have cost him.\nBEST FOR FATTENING STEERS\nPMd Dally an Average of Fifty\nPounds of Silage, Some Oil Meal\nand Clover Hay.\nOne of the cheapest and best na\ntions for fattening steers Is an aver\nage dally of 50 pounds of silage, two\nor three pounds of oil meal and two\nor three pounds of clover hay. With\ncorn as cheap as It Is In most local\nities it Is a good plan to add to thia\nration during the last two months of\nthe feeding period an ever-increasing;\namount of com.\nEARLY SHEARING IS FAVORED\nLambs Thrive Better If Mother Is Net\nCompelled to Suffer From Car\nrying Heavy Ccat of Wool.\nPractice early shearing. Sheep\nShorn early will thrive better and the\nlambs will also do better If the mother\nla not compelled to suffer from carry\ning a heavy coat of wool In hot weath\ner. There la but little gain in the\nweight of the wool after the weather\ngets warm, not enough to make it\nworth while to leave it on, when the\nramfrut of the animal la considered.\nCARE FOR FATTENING LAMBS\nOtvs an Abundance of Succulent For\nage Supplemented With Different\nKlnda of Grain.\nSpecial care should be given the\nflattening lambs as soon as they are\nweaned.

Born in Wave\nland, October 6th, 1846, he was 75\nyears of age at the time of his\ndeath, and no citizen of our sister\ncity was better known.\nThe funeral took place Tuesday\nafternoon from the residence\nand was largely attended, testifying\nto the esteem in which th e deceased\nwas held. Interment was in the\nfamily burial plot, Cedar Rest Ceme\ntery. Several grown children sur\nvive. These are Jules Favre, Jr., Al\ncide Favre, Mrs. Carmelite Carver,\nMrs. John Carver, of Waveland, and\nMrs. Josephine Allison, of New Or\nleans. The late Mrs (Judge) Lazere\nwas also a daughter of the deceased.\nAt different times Mr. Favre held\npositions of responsibility and trust,\nthus he served hi s community and\npeople in various capacities.

Solo\nmon Victims of Delivery Truck\nCollision.\nJames and Emile Larroux, young\nsons of Mrs. R. R. Solomon, residing\nin Dunbar avenue, while riding to\nCentral school Thursday morning,\non Ferre’s Bakery auto delivery\ntruck, were the victims of an acci\ndent which nearly cost them their\nlives. Helena Cowand, little daugh\nter of Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Cowand,\nresiding in Julia street, also of the\nnumber of children in the truck, was\npainfully, but sufficiently to be car\nried home and is still in bed. She\nis doing nicely.\nIt appears, as is the custom every\nmorning, the driver of the Perre de\nlivery truck, had picked up some\nseven children who were walking\nalong Second street on their way to\nCentral school. The Larroux boys\nwere riding on (he fenders, it is\nsaid. Others sat in front with the\ndriver. He was crowded and his\nposition was such he could mot steer\nclearly. Reaching the vicinity of the\nW. O, Sylvester residence, a coal de\nlivery wagon was traveling to the op\nposite direction and towards the\ntruck, when soon both collided with\nsudden impact as to turn the truck\nhalf ways around and toppled it over\nwith its freight of humanity. The\nLarroux children were partly pinned\nunder the tcrned over truck and\nwere taken out with some difficulty.\nOn examination of physicians it was\nfound that James, the oldest of the\nboys, was more seriously hurt; in\njured about the head and body only.\nThe older boy was unconscious and\nremained so throughout th e day. On\nthe advice of local physicians as a\nprecaution against any emergency\nthat might arise or develop in their\ncondition, the boys were taken to\nTouro Infirmary, New Orleans that\nevening in order that every advan\ntage of hospital equipment might be\nhad if necessary.\nLate advice from New Orleans is\nto the effect the boys are doing as\nwell as could be expected and will\nrecover. At first it was thought the\nolder boy, aged 12, nflght not sur\nvive, but his improved condition re\nmoves such possibility.\nOnly two weeks since Mr. and Mrs.\nSolomon lost a little daughter, and\ntheir sorrow has been deepend by\nthe hand of unkind fate in the near\ntragedy of Thursday morning.\nSeemingly, trouble never comes\nsingly and why It should travel\ndoubly in single grooves is unfath\nomable.\nMr. and Mrs. Solomon have the\nsympathy of the community, and it\nwill be a consolation to them to\nknow how banded are their towns\npeople in tendering sympathy and\nmaterial assistance.\nThe coal wagon is owned by the\nBay lee, light and Bottling Works,\nand the damage sustained was a\nbroken shaft * *■\nt ■ " - \'■ -H v • : * v\nPROCEEDINGS BOARD OF SU\nPERVISORS, OCTOBER, 1921.\n(Concluded from Page 1.)\nMerkle and J.
