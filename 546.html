        <pre>[" \n \nResearch on Japanese-original Anime Words based on Chinese Network \nCatchword Sphere \nJin Chang Cai  \nTeacher’s College, Beihua University, Jilin, China \nAbstract. In this paper, the phenomenon of Japanese-original anime language’s spreading in Chinese network \nlanguage was discussed, and some theory of lexicology, semantics, grammar, and cultural linguistics was proposed. \nThe characters of its different types and its influence on Chinese and the reason why the anime language can be so \npopular in the factors of psychologies, social also was analyzed. According to these studies, some suggestions were \nput forward that how to standardize the network language and how to raise its taste. \n1 General instruction \nSino-Japanese cultural exchanges have become \nincreasingly frequent prompting a large number of \nJapanese cultural products into China via the internet; the \nmost important is the Japanese animation products. \nRecently, the Chinese government also attaches great \nimportance to this emerging cultural industries animation, \nbecause at this stage of China's animation industry is still \nin the emerging stage, and there is a big gap between \nJapan and other developed countries, the animation \nindustry. Japan started in Asian culture industry is the \nearliest, especially the development of the animation \nindustry with considerable strong local characteristics, \nthe various aspects of Japanese film and television \nanimation are touted by our young people, and gradually \nintegrated into Chinese society. Based on Japanese \ntelevision anime phenomenon spreading in our country, \nnot only to investigate the Japanese film and television \nanimation and its impact on the enjoyment of visual, \nauditory and other sensory aesthetic of the economy, the \nsocial dimension of our country, more in-depth from \nlinguistics It analyzes the impact of its linguistic \nphenomena intercultural communication on Chinese. \nJapanese anime buzzwords as a new source of social \nlanguage, recently touted by the majority of youth groups, \nand gradually be brought into their daily lives. Japanese \nanimation on the source language, our predecessors have \ndone research, but mostly from the artistic angles anime \ncarried out. Few based vocabulary, semantics, grammar \nand cultural linguistics and other related theories on the \nsource animation on the network environment \nsystematically study the language from the linguistic \npoint of view, in order to strengthen the academic study \nof Chinese language network language animation, this \narticle will use knowledge source for the popular \nJapanese animation words were, multi-angle analysis of \ndecency. Finally, the emergence of this phenomenon and \nput forward their own thinking. \n \nFigure 1. Implementation challenges for Japanese-original \nanime words systems \nThe text is written symbols of language recording system; \nit is the most important auxiliary communicative tool. It \nhelps people to break through the language restrictions in \ntime and space, so to expand the communicative function \nof language. With the development of human society, \nimprove the technological level of long-distance \ncommunication and information exchange only in the \nform of letters already can not meet people's needs. The \nemergence is the Internet, to bring a new way of \ncommunicating, a new variant of the language - the \nlanguage network. Largely solve the people exchanges \nrequire efficient, simple and so on, to meet the \ncommunication needs of people fast. \nInternet language has broad and narrow sense; we put \nsome new language phenomenon around computer \ntechnology and network exchange and the formation of, \ncollectively known as the Internet language, which is a \nbroad network language. It can be broken down into three \n \n \n \n \n DOI: 10.1051/\nC© Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 201\n/\n0 0 (  201 )\n201conf\nWeb of ConferencesMATEC\natecm\n,\n0 06\n6\n6\n4\n4\n4\n4\n1\n1\n81\n81\n  \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0, which permits \ndistribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. \n\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x04\x08\t\x07\x05\n\x0b\x02\x06\x05\nArticle available at http://www.matec-conferences.org or http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/matecconf/20164401081\n", 'MATEC Web of Conferences \ncategories: one is the network-related terminology, such \nas a mouse, hardware, software, browser, firewall; second \ncategory is network-related special terms, such as login, \nInternet cafes, users, hackers, broadband; the third \ncategory is the language and symbols of Internet users in \nchat or blog, forums, and paste it frequently use, such as \ntop, sofa, bench, sell Meng, fans, 4U, ^ _ ^ and so on. \nThe first class of network language and jargon on the \nsame jargon are used in a professional field, while the \nsecond and third categories of network language is the \nlanguage of life related to the Internet, it is a narrow \nnetwork language. We need to study is the third type of \nnetwork language, these words is that people in the \nnetwork exchanges frequently used fresh, emerging a \nclass of languages, and thus is called a network \nbuzzwords. \n2 Network buzzwords features \nNetwork buzzwords used in the form of a keyboard input \ncharacters, numbers, letters, Roman letters, Japanese kana, \npunctuation, symbols, and other symbols of operation \nappears that Internet technology as the basis, the Internet \nas a medium to express some semantics, network \ncommunication for the purpose of language. Therefore, it \nhas with the written, spoken different and unique place. \nNetwork buzzwords also buzzwords in one, so its \nessential characteristic is "pop." "Pop" is "real time" and \n"dynamic". Therefore, there is a network buzzwords \ndevelopment process: to produce pop, pop to unpopular. \nIn line with people\'s social communication requires a \nperiod of buzzwords to have a strong vitality, not in line \nwith the will gradually be eliminated. It would appear \npromising buzzwords have two: one is to be absorbed, be \nabsorbed into the general vocabulary Chinese. One is the \ndisappearance of the course they will gradually be \neliminated. This shows that the buzzword is "real-time", \nwas eliminated just buzzwords history vocabulary. \nNetwork buzzwords as is "dynamic", it then disappeared \nfrom generation to popular or accepted, there is a long or \nshort process; generally this popular procedure is \nrelatively short-lived, because it has real-time, that is, in \nrapid Under the Internet, driven by some of the new, \npopular term on the Internet can be immediately spread \nof Internet users go. When it is used after a period of time, \nit will disappear. If it does not, its popular frequency \nreaches a certain level; people will lose their freshness, \nwhich eventually evolved into fairly generic common \nwords. For example earlier "rookie" "Dinosaur," "white \ncollar" "blue collar" "wage earners" and other network \nbuzzwords, have now had their glory days, become a \ncommon word. Old things will always be replaced by \nnew, older network buzzwords same will be replaced by \nnew, as times change, the subjective and objective \nconditions for the survival of the old buzzwords will \ndisappear, he lost the popular soil, and naturally they \nwould cease to exist. At this era can reflect the new \nfeatures of the new buzzwords too will produce, this is a \ndynamic process of development buzzwords transition \nfrom the old. For example, network language to describe \na person lovely time, from "cute" to "kawaii," the popular \nearliest use to the current popular "Moe" is a very typical \nexample. \nBuzzwords is a highly creative language, is a modern \nhuman wisdom. Appears at the beginning, it always gives \na new look, the feeling shines, this is one important \nreason for the popular buzzwords, especially network \nbuzzwords. China\'s Internet user’s mainly young people \nmainly, aged mainly between 21-35 years old. Features \nsuch groups of Internet users are quick-witted, curious, \ncreative, attention to social popular things, flaunt \npersonality, "has a very strong sense of anti-traditional, \nadvocating innovation, from the traditional language \nsyntax, semantics norms, standards constraints.” \nTherefore, they dare to break the inertia of thinking style, \nform their own unique insights. Coupled may be \npublished in the virtual space to conceal the identity of \ntheir own opinions and views, have a full right to speak, \nthey are continuing to create a rich, vivid image words \nand expressions to express themselves, such as "God \nhorses ( what) are the clouds, "" ginseng (life) cup \n(tragedy) "and other words such networks would highly \ninfectious. In addition to the characteristics of Internet \nusers among themselves, due to the progress of the times, \npeople thought of liberation, the pursuit of individuality \nand efficiency of modern man seems unwilling to make \nthe idea of the network so bland speak. They want to use \nthe most simple words to express the time-saving richest, \nmost vivid sense, but also highlights their personality and \ndifferent, which reflects the contemporary creative \nnetwork buzzwords. \nThe first need is communication: simple and quick, easy \neffort. With the rapid development of networks, the \narrival of the information age, people increasingly prefer \nto use simple and clear language to express themselves, \nsuch as letters, numbers, etc. to convey information, \ncommon international letters, numbers can be expressed \nwith a minimum of convey the wealth of information, so \nin this particular era was born of a number of lettered \nwords, numbers, words. Online communication is \nactually in writing, spoken exchange rate. Oral \ncommunication course is the best, most concise \ncommunication tool, but the lack of specificity of the \nvisual. Currently the network communication, we mainly \nkeyboard input tool, according to certain input procedures. \nKeyboard input pinyin to input Chinese characters not \nonly have this one form, also contains letters, numbers, \nthe arithmetic symbols, each symbol in different \nlanguages have different sounds, such as "8" as a figure \nin the Chinese and English have different pronunciation, \nand even differences in Mandarin and dialects, such as \npeople in some areas to read it as "fat" meaning \n"fortune.”This gave us a simple symbol provides a rich \nvoice material for quick and easy communication \nprovided sufficient condition. In order to achieve writing \nspeeds spoken, so some of the netizens will use shorthand \nsymbols or acronyms, or create some new vocabulary. \nFor example, "3KS (thanks abbreviations)" only need to \ntype three times, but in the original word thanks input \nwhen you need to type 6; "OIC (oh, I see homonym \n01081-p.2\n', 'representation I understand)," when in input only need to \ntype three times, the original sentence is not punctuation, \nbut also need to type 6; Again Pinyin input "Jiang Zi (" \nlike this "homonym acronym)" To type 7, type the \noriginal phrase will have 9 times. Some networks such \nbuzzwords not only impressive, but also reflect the \ncharacteristics of its simple and easy to write, greatly \nreducing the communication speed. \nLanguage network has a large number of the biggest \nfeature is the use of symbols to communicate. Or with a \ncombination of symbols representative of expression, \nsuch as, (* ^ __ ^ *), ^ _ ^, O ( _ ) O ...... and other \nmeans "happy smile"; (@  @) ~ X X ~ ~ o (> _ <) o \n~~ ...... such as performance, "sad, sad" facial expression; \nor using symbols words, such as "5201314" stands for "I \nlove you for life" "+ U" means "Go" meaning: they \nrepresent an object or symbol combination, such as, ( ) \nnnn represents a caterpillar, - <- <- <@ is a flat flower \nroses. We are very vivid glance. In addition, there is the \nancient Chinese writing enabled or borrow foreign words, \nand so on the way. For example, nowadays very fire of \nnetwork buzzwords "embarrassing" was originally an \nancient Chinese word, and now being touted users, \nbecause it is very intuitive showed a man embarrassing, \nembarrassing the way, and as "Mei" presence in the \nancient Chinese, "Kangxi": "stay with  province, or a, \npass for plum Herbal: stay, plum apricot class.”But in \ntoday\'s buzzwords in network, it also has a new meaning, \nInternet users look directly shape pronunciation, read \n"foolishly, or double-stay" means "silly, stay, very naive" \nmeans. Like body with a source vocabulary to express \nabstract semantics, or other circumstances also need to \nuse a lot of words to explain and describe, the network \npopular word sometimes can be more simple image but \nalso no shortage of humor render out, and has a strong \nvisual effect to the virtual network life adds some angry \nand realism. \n3 Dissemination in Japanese animation \nin China \nThere is "anime Kingdom," said Japan, currently the \nworld\'s largest exporter of animation production. \nJapanese animation film and television work in China \nspread of 30 years, with a gradual increase in the spread \nof technology, showing distinct stage characteristics: \nrelease from the official Internet TV to DVD and then \nreleased. \nFor the general audience in terms of Japanese anime is \nnot yet a need for psychological, mass media (mass \nmedia mainly refers to the traditional forms of media, \nsuch as movies, television, newspapers and magazines, \nbest-selling book, etc.) to provide animation film and \ntelevision works must extent to meet their common needs. \nBut for that loyal audience of Japanese anime film and \ntelevision works in terms of the mass media to provide \nanimation film has been completely unable to meet their \nneeds, they strongly want to look for another way to \nsolve this problem. \nOfficially entered China from the Internet to millions of \nhouseholds starting, the number of Internet users in China \nsince 1997 after doubling every six months remained \ngrowth. Today, China\'s Internet users have reached a very \nlarge number, more than 400 million people. At the same \ntime, with the development of mobile phones, mobile \nservices, the Internet is more ubiquitous, deep into the \nlives of ordinary people into make people read online and \nonline viewing more convenient, easy, and more without \nspending expensive cost far Japan to seek anime crossing. \nAnd it also includes all the way showing the animation \nfilm of this cultural product: text, pictures, audio and \nvideo. Thus, in the network\'s convenient, fast and cheap \nsexual attraction, the anime fans will choose the internet \nof course. Thus, downloading via a network or online to \nwatch Japanese anime number of visitors also increased \nsignificantly. \n4 Network popular Japanese anime \nloanwords source classification \nWith the popularity of the Internet, Japanese animation \nfilm to do a lot of influx in China. For the first time via \nthe Internet to translate these incoming Japanese anime \ninto Chinese available to the majority of Chinese \nanimation fans, partially proficient in Chinese and \nJapanese anime fans spontaneously established online \nsubtitle group, in the translation process, in order to \npursue efficiency, they sometimes use the Japanese kanji \nhomology characteristics of the Japanese kanji words \ncopied from or slightly modified, thus creating a large \nnumber of Chinese and Japanese Loan Word. Only the \npursuit of translation efficiency is not enough, in order to \nensure the quality of translation, they will use \ntransliteration, translation and other means to translate. \nThen these forms special, innovative Japanese loanwords \ncan easily meet contemporary animation fans novelty, \ndifference of mentality, as their common language. \nAnime in Japanese language borrowed words include two \nforms: Loan Word and transliterated words. \nThe relationship between language and society very \nclosely, language can not be separated from social and \nindependent existence. Stalin said: "To understand the \nlanguage and its development law, we must take the \nhistory of language with social development, with the \ncreation of the language, use the language of the people \nclosely linked to the history of research." Language with \nhuman society is interdependent influenced. Whatever \nthe language, will be affected by other different kinds of \nlanguages, even among its own internal dialects will \ninfluence each other, penetration. Thus, the famous \nAmerican linguist Bloomfield once said: "Unlike \ntraditional features called mainstream adoption, called the \nlanguage of borrowing in the range borrow, borrow and \nborrow our cultural differences between the dialects, the \nformer borrowed features come. to the same language \narea, which features borrowed from different languages. \n"From the lineage of view, belongs to the Sino-Tibetan \nChinese, and Japanese belong to Altaic. Therefore, \nChinese with Japanese vocabulary belongs cultural \nICEICE 2016 \n01081-p.3\n', 'MATEC Web of Conferences \nborrowing between borrowings. Now academics tend to \nthe Chinese cultural definitions of words borrowed from \nother languages are: borrowing and varying degrees of \n"finished," the word from the alien language. \n5 Network popular Japanese anime \nloanwords source of inspiration to us \nJapanese animation culture through their own success \nenhance their influence in the international arena, we can \nalso learn from them, we strive to improve the \ninternational influence of Chinese to improve China\'s \ncomprehensive national strength. At any stage of a \nsociety, to improve the social cohesion of the country and \nthe whole nation, language planning to do is to increase \nthe frequency of the national language exchanges or the \nwhole nation. In the previous stage of agricultural \ncivilization, because each nation, each country link \nexchanges between each other is not close enough, so at \nthat time just in terms of language planning issues in \nrelation to a country. This will develop into modern \nhumans, especially the era of economic globalization, any \nnation; any country can not rest on its laurels, and can not \nstay out of the tide of globalization. Therefore, an \nimportant task at this stage of language planning is to \nimprove the country\'s national or native language \ninfluence. \nIn the context of today\'s globalization, cultural and \nideological content has also become an important part of \na national interest, and culture between the countries, \ncomprehensive national strength has increasingly become \nan important parameter for the balance of interests and \npower. Cultural penetration and reverse osmosis are \nbecoming an important part of the context of \nglobalization of contention between the national interests. \nCurrently English is rapidly expanding, linguistic \nhegemony prospects if you do not see this phenomenon \nlater and blindly praise their guide language unified trend, \nwelcomed it as the arrival of the world\'s common \nlanguage, that this idea would be naive and harmful. \nStates in order to enhance their own language in the \ninternational community\'s influence all have vigorously \npursued a variety of language policy, mainly to improve \nthe economic strength of the language. Economic power \nof language is a language refers to the percentage of gross \nnational product in the region or country of the world\'s \ngross national product to use. \nAccording to the data show that in 1977, the Englishlanguage\neconomic power 34.6%, Japanese economic \npower is only 8.2%, in 2000, when English was 34.9%, \n11.4% for the rapid increase in Japanese. In these 23 \nyears, the English language economic force grew only 0.3 \npercent; the Japanese grew by 3.4%. This phenomenon \ncan be seen, although the social status of English as an \ninternational language has not changed, but as a small \nJapanese language to enhance the international influence \nis enormous. This is thanks to the Japanese government\'s \nlanguage promotion policy. Before World War II, the \nJapanese language promotion policy for war service, the \npurpose is to make the Japanese to become the lingua \nfranca in Asia and become one of the tools of aggression. \nAfter World War II, the Japanese government aims to \npromote Japanese Japanese become an important means \nto make them with the world of cultural and economic \ncooperation. This policy relies on Japanese animation \nindustry developed, strong economic strength and \nadvanced technologies, has achieved remarkable results. \nIn recent years, with the popularity of the Internet and \nyouth groups love for Japanese animation, Japanese \nlanguage economic strength will be further improved. \nReferences \n1.
