Moscow—\nIdaho\'s first annual egg-laying con\ntest. to start N\'ov. I, 1934. is being\nplanned hy the university, through\nits agricultural college, to be held at\nthe agricultural experiment Isuhsta\ntion at Caldwell.\nPresent plans call for 50 entries\nof 12 birds each, making .a total of\n600 birds. These hens will bc kept\nat the station for a year and careful\nrecords made of their laying.\nBy trapnesting it is proposed to\ndetermine which individuals and which\nvarieties lay the greatest number of\neggs during thc different months and\nduring the year. Records will bc kept\nof the size of eggs laid and the feed\nconsumed. At the end of each month,\nreports will be sent to thc newspapers\nami to thc exhibitors, giving full re\ncords regarding thc eggs Vlid by the\nindividual birds and the income, feed,\ncost, profit over feed cost, and gener\nal condition of each hen.\n"Any ponltfyman in the world will\n(be elcgihle to compete in this con\ns( l>r()| . u T ,. arkhllrs ,\nof the university department of pool\ntry husbandry.\nRecords Help\n"The records secured in this con\ntest will he very helpful to the poul\ntrymen who send in the different\nhens as thc records will enable them\nto start with a small flock of tested\nhens and to breed from it a very use\nful and profitable flock. The individ\nual is stimulated to better breeding\neach year not only in quantity hut\nalso in quality of production.\n"At a contest that smarted last year\nentries came from seven states be\nsides the one in which the contest\nal poultryman who enters his birds\nan opportunity to compare them with\nthose from other states. If he finds\nhis Inrds inferior, he strives next time\nto select and bred for superiority. If\nhis birds arc best in thc contest he\nendeavors to keep them the best hy\nstill more attention to breeding\nMust Test Hens\n"The extent ,0 which these con\ntests have stimulated better breeding\nis indicated by thc actual results in a\nCanad-an contest that has been run\nning only four years. Thc first year\naverage was 120 eggs per fowl. This\ngradually increased until h*st year if\nwas 143 eggs.\n"\'Similar contests held elsewhere\nhave served a useful purpose in the\nupbuilding of the poultry industry in\ncommunities where they have been\nheld. Thc poulfrymen and the farm\ners are inspired by the records made\nin the contests to maintain records\nof all the hens they keep. The poul\ntrvmen soon learn that hens should\nbe tested as accurately and as care\nfully as dairy cows, and they are in\nspired to keen only productive and\nprofitable flocks. There is usually\nconsiderable difference between the\nproduction of the average hen on the\nfarm or in thc commercial flock and\nthat obtained in the egg-laying con\ntest. This will serve to increase the\nproduction of thc flocks of the stale\nby stimulating more interest in better\nmethods of management as recom\nmended by the experiment station and\nworkers of the university.\n30 Contests Now\n"There are now about 30 egg lay\ning contests in thc United States and\n12 in Canada These contests have\ntaught poultrymcn that the breeding\nof poultry rquires the same amoun\'\nof rare and skill that is required in\nthe breeding of productive dairy cow s.\nThey have shown that hens that pro\nduce thc greatest number of eggs came\nfrom excellent strains that have been\ncarefully bred for years.\nThc purpose of establishing an\negg-laying contest by the college of\nagriculture is to advance thc poultry\ninterests of Idaho. If is believed that\na considerable interest will he created\namong the poultry keepers of the\nstale and that more attention will be\npaid ,0 tbe use of pure bred poultry\non thc farm and better breeding and\nfeeding methods.\nextension\nIf this end is at\n(Continued on Last Page)', 'T\nThe Revival Under Samuel\nGolden Text: "Prepare your\nunto the Lord, and serve him\n—1 Samuel 7:3.\nWe study today, said tin\nas he faced the Brotherhood\n"something of the career of the\nest prophet in Israel since\nbeginning of his life story in I\n. . to* of II\nlike Samuel, open, with the -tory\na baby boy.

There is no county management\nin North Carolina, nor so far as in\nvestigations disclose, anywhere else in\nthe United Slates.
