Deslandfes, director of the\nMeridon Observatory, near Paris ; Sir\nF. W. Dyson, ropal astronomer at\nGreenwich; R. A. Sampson, professor\nof astronomy at Edinburg University.\nThe primary object of the proposed\ncalendar reform is to make the same\ndav of the month occur on the same\ndate the year around. All that inters\nferes with this at the present time is\nthe existence of 365 days in the year in\nstead of 364, which would be equally\ndivisible by the fifty-two weeks in a\nyear, and the question of leap year.\nTo overcome the first obstacle, it is\nproposed to create New Year\'s day\ninto a day entirely outside of the cal\nendar, thus leaving only 364 days to be\naccounted for. Then, for the leap years,\nit is proposed to treat the extra day\nthe same way, making it a separate day\njust after June 30th, entirely outside\nthe calander. In order to make Easter\na fixed instead of a moveable feast day\nit will be necessary to have the consent\nof the Holy See, and negotiations are\nalready under way to that end at\nRome.\n- LEISURE HOUR TONIGHT\nAfter a short business meeting the\nLei sure Hour Club this evening will\nhave an "Indian" program.\nMiss Grace Dangberg of Minden will\naddress the club on the "Ethnological\nPoints of the Washoe Indians;" Mrs.\nMorrison will have a paper on Indian\nmusic, and Miss Barlow of the Stewart\nIndian school will illustrate with In\ndian songs.

But for the efforts of the Irish in America the Irish\nat home might long ago have abandoned an unequal contest, but in\nthe Lnited States they found an unfailing source of svmpathv and\nfinancial assistance.\nWhile the greater part of the support that came from the United\nStates was earnestly and honestly disinterested, politicians found the\nIrish question an easy issue to capitalize and they made the most of\nit. The business of playing to Irish emotions paid large dividends in\nthe emoluments of office, and no politician ever allows an animosity\nto soften when he can profit by keeping it aggressively alive.\nQuite apart from the activities of professional agitators the sym\npathies of other Americans have for the most part been on the side of\nIreland. Their intuitions told them that regardless of all the accusa\ntions and counter-accusations on both sides, there must be something\nradically wrong with a system of government that had produced such\nirreconcilable antagonisms. They knew something of civil var be\ncause their own country had had a civil war, but it was a war which\nleft no permanent reprisals and the wounds were healed when the\nnext generation appeared on the scene, while Ireland had been for\ncenturies an open ulcer which no British government tried to heal,\nand for fifty years it had poisoned every legitimate relation between\nthe United States and Great Britain.\nSince 1914 the Irish question has been more disturbing than ever\nin respect to these relations. It entered into every phase of American\nforeign policy and helped to becloud almost every American issue. It\nhad more to do with the defeat of the treaty of Versailles than anv\nother influence. It kept the United States out of the League of Na\ntions and made a better understanding with Great Britain impossible.\nBritish statesmen have been very slow to appreciate the part\nthat the Irish question played in the relations between the two coun\ntries. They have been disposed to treat it rather contemptuously\nwithout realizing its implications. It was not until their own colonies\ntook a hand in the quarrel and insisted on a settlement that thev\nwere willing to admit that Ireland meant more than an insular\npolitical feud.\nIt is only fair to Lloyd George and his associates to say that\nwhen they finally came to see that neither force nor makeshift ex\npedients would be longer available and that an honest effort must be\nmade to solve the problem on its merits they behaved like true states\nmen and great statesmen. They saw the thing through and made a\nsettlement that is -bound to become one of the brightest naes in\nBritish history. When they disposed of the Irish question they dis\nposed of an American question too, and the day the government of\nthe Irish Free State is established will mark also the beginning of a\nnew era in the relations between the United States and Great Britain.\noo\nThe Republicans in rejecting Article X of the League of Nations\nand accepting Article II of the new "Four-Power Alliance" proved\nthe old aphorism of "straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel."\noo\nWASTED SERMONS\nSermons that don\'t seem to get any results: Sermons on danc\ning; sermons on card-playing; sermons on theaters; sermons on auto\nmobiles.
