The olfijeers are gi.en\nfair warning that they must not\nsearch dwellings without warrants\nmd no attempts to do so will be made.\nIt will he a very rare case in which,\nunder the act, an officer can be prosecuted\non account of the search of othr\nproperty. Before a case against\nan officer can be sustained it will be\n.ccr sary to show not only that the\nflie r did not have a warrant but that\n. icted maliciously and without\nprobable cause.\n"It. therefore, appears that so long\n?is prohibition otlirors tavo reasonable\nround for suspecting a violation of\nlie prohibition act they can not be\npunished for searching property other s\nhan a dwelling without a warrant.\n\\"o substantial decrease in the activi- j\nies of prohibition officers is anticianted\nas the result of the new act and\nam entirely confident that the United\nStates attorneys and the department\nof jusliel? are not going to insli\'ute\nproceedings against officcYs ex*?"pt\nin the case of a wilful and wan\'on\nsearch by an officer without\nreasonable grounds for doing so."\n" *\n"Listen Lester"\n%.

There is not a nation\nrepresented- there that is iuk\nafraid of every other nation represented\nand they are all afraid of Ger\nmany, not represented. Each nation\nwants every other nation to abando:\nits program of building armies ano\nnavies, but would except itself. The\nwhole plan is based upon a false\npremise. About all that is going tc\nbe "scrapped\'\' is such portion of shipt\nand equipment found to be obsolete.\nThere is only one way that peace\nof long duration may be secured\nThat is by way of the boycott. If thi\ncivilized nations will enter a solemn\nagreement one with another to com\npletely isolate any single nation thai\ngoes to war, refusing to buy, sell 01\nhold any intercourse whatsoever with\nthe belligerent nation, it would be im\nposible for such a nation to carry\non a successful war. All that would\nbe necessary to bring such a nation tc\nits knees would be the boycott. Tc\nmaintain this, a very small army and\nnavy possessed by the leading nation*\n? - would be adequate. They could com\nbine and be more powerful than am\nsingle ation. Those who are responsible\nfor "scrapping\'\' the league of na\ntions are now talking about "scrapping"\nbattleships and other war im\nploments. But the league of nation*\nidea was the real way to safety. Ti c\npresent movement is going to degenerate\ninto a huge joke. It is already\na thing to be laughed at.\nOne of our best farmers recently\nhad an experience that points a moral\n*? This farmer came to Union from hif\nhome seven miles away, and hauled ii\nfour hogs that he brought to seli\nto the market. When he got here, hi\nfound that, owing to the size, then\nwas no market for the hogs. Th<\nhogs weighed about 350 pounds apiece\nThe market man told the farmer h<\ncould not use the hogs of that size tc\nadvantage. The market man had thai\nright, but it was hnr<t on the farmer\nNow, if that particular farmer, alon >\nwith twenty-nine others, had eacl\nraised four such hogs and pooled thei.\nhogs, it would have made up a 42,00C\npounds\' carload that could have bee*:\nshipped to market at a fair price\nBetter still, had the same thirty farmers\neach raised eight hogs weighing\n200 pounds apiece, they could have\npooled their interest and shipped a\ncar containing 240 nogs aggregating\nin weight 48,000 pounds. It is a\nthoroughly established fact that it\ncosts less per pound to raise a hog\nweighing 200 pounds than it does one\nweighing 350 pounds. The agricultural\ndepartment, Clembon College\nand every farm paper in the country\ntell us this is a fact, Then, too, the\nsmaller hog is in greater demand.\nYou can find a more ready sale for\nthe smaller hog.\nWhy cannot thirty farmers, living\nin different sections of the county,\nplan together to produce eight hogs\nweighing around 200 pounds, bring\nthem to Union on the same day and\nship them to market jointly? There\n^ 1 .1 I L\nmiouiu oe no real difficulty in such a\nmove. It would be cooperative marketing.\nIt could be expanded to take\nin a hundred, five hundred, farmers.\nBy acting together it can be done. 1\nIndependently, it cannot be achieved.\nThere is probably not a big packing ,\nplant anywhere in the country that\ncould not use the hogs and that would\nnot pay a reasonable price for them.\nSubscribe to The Union Times >\nOur cat says to argue with a man\ndrunk is a waste of breath.\n*\nOur cat says don\'t play the game\ndishonorably.\nOur cat says wise farmers can raise\ncotton even under boll w^vil cond.\nions.\n? ?\nOur cat says it is a poor puddin;\nwithout sauce.\n*\nOur cat says it ill becomes the liv\ning to malngn the dead.\n* ?\nOur cat savs it is seldom ? ? rpwro\nhaving refrained from speaking de\nnunciation.\n. *\nOur cat says honest work has ncvei\n, et destroyed a man\'s appetite.\n* * +\nOur cat says he has a nice, fat tur j\nkey purchased from Orus Relue. \'\n** * *\nOur cat says moderation in catinc\nshould be in evidence Thanksgiving\n)ay.\nOur cat says ho reads in the Bible\nhat those who live by the sword shal.\nperish by the sword.\n*\nOur cat says the number of half\nbaked ideas floating around seems te\nbe diminishing.\n* * *\nOur cat says a theory that refuse\no be converted into a fact should be\npossessed gingerly.\n* ? +\nOur oat says a thankless heart is a\nvicked one.\n* * *\nOur cat says about the lonesomesf\nound he ever heard is a mill tvhistle\nat 4:30 a. m. on a cold morning.\n? *\nOur cat says those who live by\ngraft often find the living precarious\n? *\nOur cat savs it is hi\'f.ter flolnv -j\nwrong start.\n* *\nOur cat says while we are honoring\nGeneral Foch the French government\nis preparing to maintain its vast\nirmy.\n*\nOur cat says France does not inend\nto disarm.\n,\nOur cat says it is a stupid mousi\nthat plays in front )f the cat.\n* * *\nOur cat says action should be based\nupon deliberation.\n* * *\nOur cat says the price of cotton is\niow on the mend, the "distress" bales\nhaving been disposed of.\nSpecial Advertisements\nFOR RENT?Store in Smith block\nApply to Mr. C.
