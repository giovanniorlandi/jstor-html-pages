Another frightful catastrophe lias, been added to the record of terribly fatal marine disasters, in the waters of the northwest and two scores of human, lifes have been sacrificed. The Puget Sound steamer Dix, was suuk as a result of a collision with the tug Jeanie off, Al-Ki point last night at 7:35 o\'clock. There were about, SO passengers on the Dix and W of tliem are believed to be, drowned., The Dix was on her way to Port Blakely and nearly, all of her passengers were Port Blakely people. The, Jeanie was bound to Tacoma. The Dix got out of her course, and ran along side of the Jeanie and tried to cut across, her bcw. She was struck by the larger boat, which crash, ed into her, cutting a great gaping hole. The Dix keeled, over and sunk almost immediately., The cabin was filled with women who were doomed, from the very beginning. Only one, a girl, Alice Simp, son age 15 years, escaped and was rescued. The others, were drowned in the little room into which, they had, been crowded., The men, many of whom weie 011 deck, sprang into, the water. About half of them were rescued by 1 he boats, from the Jeanie which were lowered., It is evident that the man at the wheel. the mate of, the little craft, was responsible for the act. It is believed, that in his excitment he turned the wheel the wrong, way. He was drowned., The accident all happened so quickly and so unex, pectedly that few of those saved realized what had hap, pened until they found themselves struggling for their, lives in the waters of the sound., Few of the bodies of those who were in the cabin have, been recovered., ANARCHISTS ATTEMPT TO, WRECK ST.

The marital troubles, of the Countess Boni de C\'a?tellane,, formerly Miss Anna Gou\'d of New, York, were ended today when Judge, Ditte granted her absolute divorce from, her noble husband. When the verdict, was rendered the vast audience broke, into a cheering mob., The testimony had laid bare all of the, family secrets of the couple and it, showed the count up in such bad light, that his countrymen joined in God, speedingthe American girl who had, been the victim of outrageous treat, ment., The court denounced the count in, scathing terms. Boni had made appli, cation for -an allowance if the divorce, were granted. This Judge Ditte denied, on the grouod that he had no right to, make such a request. He cited the, testimony to show that the count had, pinched and strucK his wife, that he had, been intimate with other women, had, lived double lives in various apartments, at different places where revelry had, run high through the expenditure of, his wife\'s money. For these reasons, the judge sa\'d the claimant had no, grounds for a further claim on his, wife\'s resources., The custody of the children was given, to the countess. In deciding upon this, point the court took occasion to again, refer to the dissolute conduct of the, count and his absolute unworthiness., Reference was made to the occasion, when the couple\'s property was attach, ed to satisfy creditors who would wait, no longer. The judge scored the count, and reminded him of the fact that the, countess on more than one oncasion had, been obliged to sell trinkets.of her girl, hood and furniture to satisfy his de, mands for money., Miss Helen Gould and the countess, will leave on an early boat for New, York, where the tatter will go iuto re, tirement for several months., HOW CAN CONGRESS, REFUSE DEMAND?, The consrress of the I\'nited States, baa given Alaska the right to elect a, delegate to stand as a represenlatile of, the expressed will of the people.
