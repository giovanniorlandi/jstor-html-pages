These are novel perspectives connecting the altered intrauterine\nmilieu to a rising number of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia as well as the Metabolic\nSyndrome (Met S). Moreover, metabolic associated atherosclerotic diseases are connected to perigestational maternal health. The\n“Thrifty Phenotype Hypothesis” introduced cross-generational links between poor conditions during gestation and metabolic as\nwell as cardiovascular alterations postnatal. Still, mechanisms altering the intrauterine milieu causing metabolic and associated\natherosclerotic diseases are currently poorly understood. This paper will give novel insights in fundamental concepts connected to\nspecific molecular mechanisms “programming” diabetes and associated metabolic as well as cardiovascular diseases.\n1. Introduction\nType 2 diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic as well\nas cardiovascular diseases run an epidemic wave worldwide.\nRegarding to the World Health Organization (WHO) there\nare 347 millions people diagnosed with diabetes worldwide\n[1]. Furthermore, based on WHO fact sheets more than 1.4\nbillion adults were diagnosed overweight, in 2008, and of\nthese more than 200 million men and approximately 300\nmillion women were documented being obese [1]. Hence,\nover 40 million children under the age of 5 years were\ndiagnosed overweight in the year 2010 [1]. Causes are seen\nin life style factors, such as high carbohydrate, respectively,\nhigh fat diets, and lack of exercise leading to obesity causing\ninsulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and beta cell dysfunction,\nas well as associated metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.\nBut, there is more and more evidence, that maternal\nperi-gestational genomic and environmental conditions may\n“imprint” metabolic and cardiovascular conditions in their\noffspring. Furthermore, novel insights underline important\nmolecular and epigenetic changes in dysmetabolic pregnancies\naltering the intrauterine environment featuring evident\nprogramming concepts of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases\nin these offspring. Fundamental concepts of molecular\nand epigenetic mechanisms as well as key functions of the\nuteroplacental unit are starting to emerge quickly. Based\non highlighted literature, especially Fernandez-Twinn et al.\n[2], this paper will give novel and future-directed insights\nin essential concepts linked to molecular mechanisms of\ndiabetic and metabolic programming.\n2. Epidemiological Facts\nThe term “programming” defines the perturbation at (a)\ncritical period(s) of development causing permanent lifelong\nalteration(s) with irreversible consequences. An epi-\ndemiological key work connecting poor fetal growth and\nsubsequent development of impaired glucose tolerance and\nnon-insulin-dependent diabetes, as well as hypertension and\ncardiovascular disease, for example, was presented by Hales\n', '2 ISRN Pediatrics\nand Barker (“Fetal Origin Hypothesis”) [3, 4]. The authors\ncould show that men in their 60s, who had documented\nlower weights at birth and throughout their first year of life,\nwere more susceptible to develop impaired glucose tolerance,\nnon-insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension as well\nas cardiovascular disease [2–4]. These insights induced\nthe “Thrifty Phenotype Hypothesis” connecting embryonic,\nrespectively, fetal “malnutrition” to altered metabolic as\nwell as associated conditions postnatal (Figure 1) [2].\nSome of these modifications may have permanent lifelong\nconsequences leading to metabolic, cardiovascular as well as\nassociated diseases later on [2, 5]. Coming from the “Thrifty\nPhenotype Hypothesis,” Gluckman et al. reached out for\nthe “Predictive Adaptive Responses Hypothesis,” which\nunderlines that the embryo, respectively, fetus estimates\nand “predicts” the postnatal environment by “adapting”\ndevelopmental processes already in utero [2, 6].\nHowever, not having mapped the entire complexity of\nperi-gestational imprinting factors as well as vulnerable\nprogramming time windows within the in utero as well as\nex utero development, yet, this altered in utero development\nmay be altered again, postnatal, by nutritional and life style as\nwell as environmental factors, for example, causing adverse\nmetabolic and cardiovascular diseases later on [2]. To exemplify,\nthe Dutch Hunger Winter respectively Dutch Famine\nStudy showed increased numbers of adults diagnosed with\nimpaired glucose tolerance and obesity, who were fetuses at\nthe time of consequent alimentary rationing about the end\nof World War II [2, 7]. This study raised another important\n“programming” feature, emphasizing the importance of\nvulnerable “timing periods,” respectively, “developmental\nepisodes” determining long-term consequences [2, 7]. It\ncould be displayed that people who were fetuses in their\nparticularly third trimesters during this period of famine had\nthe worst metabolic outcome later in life as adults [2, 7].\nOther important observations were documented in twin\nstudies [2, 8–10]. By comparing twins with lower birth\nweights to twins with higher birth weights, it could be\ndisplayed that twins with lower birth weights were more\nsusceptible to altered glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes,\nand cardiovascular diseases, for example, see studies in\n[2, 8, 9]. Nowadays, clear related connections between\nlow birth weight, but also high birth weight, and the\nsusceptibility of postnatal metabolic, cardiovascular, and\nassociated changes have been described [5, 11–13]. But\nsince birth weight seems to be connected to metabolic\nand cardiovascular diseases in a “u-shaped” relationship\nlots of epidemiological, experimental, and clinical studies\nhave focused on “programming” mechanisms within this\ntransgenerational setting. Today, it seems presumably that\nespecially maternal obesity and gestational diabetes as well\nas pregestational maternal diabetes are one of the strongest\nprogramming factors causing fetal malformations, altered\nbirth weights as well as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases\nin their offspring postnatal.\nBy following the “Fetal Insulin Hypothesis,” genetically\ndetermined alterations within the insulin signaling cascades,\nwhich may, for example, result in impaired glucose tolerance\nand insulin resistance, could be connected to altered fetal\ndevelopment as well as long-term metabolic changes [2].\nMeanwhile, further studies support this hypothesis, for\nexample, by linking mutations in the glucokinase gene\n(maturity onset diabetes of the young, MODY 2) to reduced\nbirth weights [2]. Lindsay et al. [14] showed by investigating\nspecific polymorphisms, which are associated with\naltered glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, that birth\nweights might be clearly influenced peri-gestational [14].\nStudies, which compared genetic influences, for instance,\npolymorphisms or mutations, and environmental effects\non the embryo, respectively, fetus, suggest that imprinting\nmechanisms and interaction effects caused by environmental\nfactors might be strongly related to the outcome of metabolic\nand cardiovascular diseases later in life [2, 15]. But, still\ndeeper insights analyzing the power and outcomes of\ndifferent effects on both generations need to be analyzed\nmore in detail. At least, these analyses provide evidences that\nimpaired glucose tolerance, respectively, type 2 diabetes may\nhave genetic aspects.\nHowever, there is a broad spectrum of predominantly\nmaternal influences, which are clearly linked to altered\nintrauterine environment and therefore associated with an\naltered metabolic and cardiovascular long-term outcome in\nthe offspring. Representatives within this trans-generational\nmetabolic programming are, for example, maternal pregestational\ndiabetes as well as gestational diabetes, moth-\nerly obesity as well as raised maternal age, and maternal\nhypercholesterolemia as well as poor or inadequate nutrition,\nincluding macro- and micronutrient deficiency [2]. Further,\nmaternal smoking, motherly stress factors, maternal hypertension,\nand pregnancy-related complications, such as (pre-)\neclampsia, processes of systemic inflammation, and hypoxia,\nas well as combined dysmetabolic conditions, such as the\nMetabolic Syndrome, cause alterations in the intrauterine\nmilieu [2]. This altered intrauterine environment is strongly\nassociated with modified embryo-fetal development, which\nmay be caused due to different molecular, respectively, epigenetic\npathways in utero related to structural and functional\nalterations during development of the offspring.\nGiven these facts, the embryo-fetal development in general,\nbut also several organ functions in the offspring, such\nas the endocrine, immune, or hematopoetic system, may be\nmodified due to altered in utero environment causing, for\ninstance, short, as well as long-term metabolic and cardiovascular\nchanges. An altered embryo-fetal development is often\nassociated with modified pancreas mass, impaired insulin\nsecretion, changed brain and neural development, altered\nadipose and skeletal muscle structure, including impaired\ninsulin and cytokine signaling and embryo-fetal hypoxia as\nwell as diversified kidneys and cardiovascular structures.\nStill, the mechanisms of developmental programming are\npoorly understood.\n3. Experimental and Clinical Facts\nCommon risk factors linked to altered in utero milieu\nas well as long-term metabolic and cardiovascular consequences\nare, for instance, maternal peri-gestational diabetes,\n', 'ISRN Pediatrics 3\nReduced\nbeta-cell mass\nDysregulation of the \nneuroendocrine axes\nDysmetabolic changes \nin liver, muscles, fat, and so forth \nReduced number of the \nnephrons\nInsulin resistance\nHypertension\nM\net\nab\nol\nic\n S\nyn\ndr\nom\ne\nHyperphagia\nBeta-cell dysfunction\nPre\ngn\nan\ncy\nAdulthoodperinatal health\nAlteration of the intra-uterine\nmilieu, placenta dysfunction, and so forth\nPo\nstn\nata\nl a\nda\npta\ntio\nns\nObesity\nFigure 1: The “Thrifty Phenotype Hypothesis.” Modified from [2].\nrespectively, gestational diabetes, increasing maternal age,\nmotherly obesity, and maternal macro- as well as micronutrient\nrestrictions and shifting of nutrient contents, such\nas high fat or carbohydrate diets as well as low protein\neating (Figure 2) [2–7, 16–20]. Furthermore, maternal\nhypoxia, iron restriction, endotoxemia, and glucocorticoid\nexposure as well as placental insufficiency are linked to\nalterations within the intrauterine milieu, poor or altered\nfetal growth, malformations and long-term metabolic as well\nas cardiovascular changes in the offspring [2–7, 14, 16–27].\nThese aspects are just representatives for numerous factors,\nwhich are mostly applied to poor developmental intrauterine\nenvironment and gestational, but also postnatal changes\n(Figure 2) [2–7, 16–28].\n3.1. Focusing on Experimental Facts. In vivo models are\nwidely used to analyze molecular, mechanistic, and phenotypic\nchanges within the trans-generational metabolic\nand cardiovascular programming [2, 15–17, 20, 22–24, 28].\nEspecially, rodent models possess considerable advantages,\nsuch as a shorter gestational period as well as higher numbers\nof offspring, providing the possibility to analyze complex\ntrans-generational mechanisms in both generations, but also,\nfor example, the common accessible uteroplacental unit.\n3.1.1. Pregestational and Gestational Diabetes. Maternal\npregestational diabetes respectively, gestational diabetes as\nwell as maternal, obesity are considered to be one of\nthe strongest imprinting factors in terms of metabolic\nprogramming [2, 20, 23, 24, 28]. Gestational diabetes ranks\nas one of the inducing factor for impaired glucose tolerance\nand type 2 diabetes in the offspring by altering the in utero\nmilieu causing permanent defects in glucose homeostasis\nand type 2 diabetes in subsequent generations later in life\n(Figure 2) [2, 20]. Influences of maternal diabetes on their\noffspring can be modulated by streptozotocin (STZ). STZ, a\nchemical which destroys β-cells, is given by dose-dependent\nschemes leading, for example, either to weaker or stronger\nforms of (gestational) diabetes [2, 24]. Several studies\ndisplayed hyperinsulinemia, islets alterations, changes in\ninsulin secretion, macrosomia, for example, in their offspring\n[2, 24]. In analogy to the epidemiological and experimental\nstudies, gestational diabetes may lead to either low birth\nweight or high birth weight [2, 20, 24, 29].\n3.1.2. Preconceptional Obesity as well as Gestational Weight\nGain. Maternal obesity before and when entering pregnancy\nis one of the crucial metabolic and cardiovascular imprinting\nfactors in their offspring (Figure 2) [2, 13, 25, 26]. It has\nbeen described that maternal obesity causes altered insulin\n', '4 ISRN Pediatrics\nMaternal \ndiabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, \nMetabolic Syndrome, diet, food intake, lifestyle factors, \niron concentration, glucocorticoid exposure, and so on\nFe\ntu\ns\nDisbalance in \nplacenta trophoblast \ninvasion\nPlacenta\ngrowth\nDisbalance in \nhormone \nproduction\nDisbalance in uteroplacental\ntransport \nfunction\nAlteration of the \nplacenta and uterus \nperfusion\nOverexpression/\nunderexpression of \ntransporters and\nenzymes\nDysturbance in \nmetabolism\nOxidative stress\nInflammation\nHypoxia\nDisturbance of the barrier \nfunctions \n(e.g., glucocorticoids)\nAlteration of development \nHistone modification and DNA methylation\nProgramming \nof diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, \nMetabolic Syndrome and atherosclerotic diseases, and so forth\nM\not\nh\ner\nthe utero-placental\nU\nte\nro\n-p\nla\nce\nn\nta\nl\nu\nn\nit\nU\nte\nro\n-p\nla\nce\nn\nta\nl p\ner\nfu\nsi\non\nFe\nta\nlpl\nac\nen\nta\nl p\ner\nfu\nsi\non\nFigure 2: Mechanisms altering the intrauterine milieu causing diabetic, metabolic and cardiovascular programming.\nand leptin concentrations, which may cause endocrine\nmodifications related to its synthesis, secretion, or action,\nleading to obesity in their offspring [2, 13, 23, 27]. Next\nto the maternal body weight per se experimental studies\nshowed that maternal leptin concentrations may be linked\nto fetal key pathways [27, 30] causing metabolic changes in\nthe next generation. However, targeting maternal obesity,\nArmitage et al. emphasizes the consequences of exposure\nto an energy rich diet during development [25]. Therefore,\nmaternal overnutrition may act as an imprinting stimulus\nleading to metabolic changes in their offspring [25]. But\nalso insulin and leptin concentrations may work as target\nprogramming hyperphagia, obesity, insulin resistance, and\ndiabetes in the offspring. Having these concepts in mind,\nnumerous studies analyzing courses of different gestational\nweight gain (GWG) and its outcomes on the offspring have\nbeen done [29, 31]. Still, the impact of GWG on both\ngenerations seems to be variable, but also associated with\nadditional features. Further studies to gain deeper insights\nneed to be done.\n3.1.3. Pregestational and Gestational Hypercholesterolemia.\nHowever, it has been reported that altered maternal saturated\nfatty acid intake and hypercholesterolemia are harmful\nduring the embryo-fetal development [32–36]. Palinski\net al. displayed that maternal hypercholesterolemia could be\nlinked to early postnatal metabolic changes, and connected to\nincreased atherosclerotic plaque rates at early developmental\nstages in their offspring [32]. Therefore, more evidence\nis given that maternal nutrient patterns and metabolic\nconstitutions alter molecular as well as phenotypic outcomes\nin offspring of dyslipidemic mothers. Today, maternal dietary\nhabits mimicking the Western life style seem to be clearly\nlinked to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in their\noffspring.\n3.1.4. Maternal Macro- and Micronutrient Restriction. Not\nonly maternal overnutrition but also maternal macro- as\nwell as micronutrient restriction seems to play a crucial role\nof metabolic and cardiovascular programming. However,\nmaternal food restriction up to 50% of ad lib during the\nlast week of pregnancy causes an impairment of β-cell\ndevelopment in the offspring [2, 37]. Additionally, Garofano\net al. stated that pancreatic “differentiation may be altered at\nfetal stages while proliferation may be affected after weaning”\n[37]. Therefore, by continuing the calorie restriction during\nthe suckling period, the offspring possess a permanent\nreduction in β-cell mass and impaired glucose tolerance.\nIn consequence, maternal food restriction up to 70% of ad\nlib resulted in hyperinsulinemia, hyperphagia, obesity and\nhypertension [2, 38].\nA very well-studied in vivo model displays the maternal\nlow protein model. For example, Snoeck et al. showed the\nlinking of maternal low protein diet and lower birth weights\n', 'ISRN Pediatrics 5\nin the offspring as well as decreased beta-cell proliferation\nand islet size in neonates or even altered adipocyte properties\n[39]. Focusing on the postnatal development of offspring\nwhich were in utero imprinted by maternal low protein\nintake, it could be reported that they experienced an agedependent\ndeficit of glucose tolerance causing impaired\nglucose tolerance, insulin resistance and diabetes by an age\nof 17 months at the latest [16]. Moreover, Ozanne and\nher colleagues, for example, could show that muscle insulin\nresistance in growth-restricted offspring is connected to an\naltered expression of Protein Kinase C zeta [40], by analyzing\na low protein model.\n3.1.5. Intrauterine Artery Ligations. There is rich evidence\nthat placental insufficiency, for example, due to intrauterine\nunilateral or bilateral artery ligations lead to impaired nutrient\nperfusion through placenta and therefore to intrauterine\ngrowth retardations [2, 20, 41–43]. Unilateral as well as\nbilateral artery ligations are thought to cause placental\ninsufficiency altering the metabolic outcome of the offspring.\nBoloker et al. described that offspring of uterine ligated dams\nshowed reduced β-cell mass and became clearly diabetic\nalready postnatal early on [20]. But, it is also discussed\nthat consequences of artery ligations may affect the next\ngeneration even more. Boloker et al. displayed altered insulin\nsecretions already at an age of approximately 5 weeks and\ndiabetic conditions already at an age of 26 weeks in the next\ngeneration [20]. Furthermore, it is discussed that there may\nbe a gender different outcome additionally.\n3.1.6. Maternal Hypoxia. Maternal hypoxia seems to have\nclearly impact on the metabolic as well as cardiovascular\noutcome in their offspring. However, maternal hypoxia may\nbe linked to placental hypoxia causing altered fetal metabolic\nas well as phenotypic changes. But also cardiovascular diseases\ncould be targeted by following chronic prenatal hypoxic\nconditions. Therefore, Li et al. respectively Peyronnet et al.\nshowed that prenatal chronic hypoxia could be linked to low\nbirth weights and significant increases in the susceptibility of\nadult cardiovascular diseases (Figure 2) [44, 45].\n3.1.7. Maternal Glucocorticoid Exposure. Maternal perigestational\nglucocorticoid exposure seems to play a crucial\nrole imprinting phenotypic, and metabolic as well as cardiovascular\nchanges in their offspring [46]. It has been discussed\nthat maternal prenatal glucocorticoid exposure could be\nlinked to reduced birth weights postnatal and hyperglycemic\nas well as hypertensive conditions in their offspring in their\nadulthood [14]. Lindsay et al. hypothesized that 11βHSD2\nactivity may be altered causing low birth weights and\nmetabolic long-term consequences in the offspring [14].\n3.2. Focusing on Clinical Facts. Underlining epidemiological\nand experimental studies, several clinical studies support\ndifferent trans-generational programming concepts connecting\nthese insights to long-term metabolic and cardiovascular\ndiseases in the offspring. By focusing on clinical analyses,\nmost phenotypic changes not only in mothers but also in\ntheir children have been highlighted.\n3.2.1. Maternal Obesity. Maternal obesity could be identified\nas one of the fundamental metabolic and cardiovascular\nimprinting factors on their offspring. But to assess increased\nrisk of metabolic and cardiovascular malprogramming early\non birth weight studies targeting trans-generational aspects\nand mechanistic as well as phenotypic changes have been\ninvestigated. Having in mind that lower and higher birth\nweights are connected in a “u-shaped” way [11] to an\nincreased risk of metabolic risk, especially type 2 diabetes,\nadditional focus on changes in fat proportions, body mass\nindex (BMI), appetite control and mechanisms of hypothalamic\npituitary axis, insulin secretion and sensing as well as\nvascular responsiveness are discussed to imprint offspring of\nobese mothers [13]. Since there is a trend that mothers seem\nto be on a higher age when entering pregnancy maternal age\nassociated with increased metabolic and associated changes\nmay act as further imprinting patterns on their children\n[2, 13, 28, 30].\n3.2.2. Birth Weights. In a meta-analyses of Harder et al.,\nfor example, it could be indicated that higher birth weights\n(>4000 g) and lower birth weights (<2500 g) tend to be\na crucial risk factor for an increased susceptibility for\ntype 2 diabetes [11]. Focusing on the u-shaped curve by\nfollowing the end of high birth weights, it has been discussed\nthat maternal hyperglycemia, respectively, maternal obesity\nmay lead to increased fetal insulin concentrations causing\nmacrosomia, malformations, and higher birth weights in\ntheir offspring [2, 11, 13]. Focusing on the other end of\nthe u-shaped curve by targeting lower birth weights, it has\nbeen discussed that prenatal under- or malnutrition could\nbe linked to alterations in the intrauterine environment\ncausing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases postnatal.\nNevertheless, low birth weight babies seem to be more\naffected to obtain overnutrition postnatal causing rapid\nweight gain leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes in\nadulthood [2, 8, 11].\n3.2.3. Maternal Hypercholesterolemia. As already mentioned,\nmaternal hypercholesterolemia could also be connected to\nearly metabolic and cardiovascular changes in their offspring\n[35, 36]. Napoli et al. suggested that maternal hypercholesterolemia\nduring pregnancy may induce changes in the fetal\naorta determining long-term susceptibility of fatty-streak\nformations as well as typical atherosclerotic lesions [35,\n36]. By following this concept, dietary interventions during\npregnancy may offer long-term benefits in their offspring\n[35, 36].\n4. The Uteroplacental Unit\nThe utero-placental unit displayed an underestimated role\nwithin cross-generational programming and gathers more\nand more attention (Figure 2). Hence, the utero-placental\nunit reflects a metabolically active system, which seems to\n', '6 ISRN Pediatrics\nbe involved, for example, in the transportation of nutrients,\noxygen, amino acids, the production of hormones, and the\nregulation of fetal growth [47–52]. Glucose displays one\nof the main sources of energy for the human fetuses and\nthe placenta [47–52]. The maternal-fetal glucose consumption\nis described to be different in pregnancies associated\nwith intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) [47, 48, 50].\nAdditionally, amino and fatty acid transports are altered in\nIUGR fetuses, too [47–52]. Focusing on endocrine functions,\nthe placenta produces several hormones, including estrogens\nand progesterone, hCG, human GH variant, and human\nplacental lactogen [47–52]. However, several studies have\nshown associations between concentrations in hormones\nand embryonic growth velocity, birth weight, and placental\nweight [47–53]. Additionally, it has been described that\nan altered utero-placental perfusion and an inadequate\ntrophoblast invasion as well as disturbances in the placental\nbarrier function, for example, glucocorticoid barrier, are\nlinked to IUGR respectively diabetic pregnancies [47–53].\nAdditionally, it has been also suggested that the synthesis\nas well as secretion of adipocyte-derived hormones, such\nas leptin, is already regulated due to fetal development\n[54–57]. Further, it has been described that hypothalamic\nneuropeptides, which regulate energy intake in adult life,\nmay be already functioning in the fetal brain [54–57].\nFurthermore, Plagemann et al. showed in in vivo studies an\nearly increase in weight gain and fat depositions followed\nby hyperphagia, obesity, hyperleptinaemia, hyperglycaemia,\nand hyperinsulinaemia as well as insulin resistance [54–57].\n5. Molecular Mechanisms of Diabetic and\nMetabolic Programming\nIn general, the term “programming” defines perpetuation\nat a critical period of development causing alterations with\nlifelong, sometimes irreversible consequences. These multiple\nmechanisms of programming reflect interplays of genetic\nand environmental influences at early stages of development\nmodeling diabetic, dysmetabolic, and associated cardiovascular\ndiseases later in life. Looking from the genetic point,\nthe genotype of the fetus can be influenced by mutations. For\ninstance, a mutation in glucokinase or chromosome 6 may\nresult in impaired insulin secretion or in polymorphisms,\nsuch as INS-VNTRI polymorphism or polymorphisms in\nthe IGF 1 gene promoter region [58, 59]. Coming from the\nenvironmental perspective, mechanisms of influences seem\nto be more complex and are abrasively divided in adverse\nintrauterine and adverse postnatal environmental factors.\nConsidering adverse intrauterine environmental parameters,\nfactors such as maternal food restriction, malnutrition,\nplacental dysfunction, obesity, gestational diabetes, hypertension,\npreeclampsia, and gestational weight gain play\nan important role. Coming from the adverse postnatal\nenvironment perspective, factors like malnutrition, such as\nhigh fat diet, early “catch-up” growth [2, 13, 28], inactivity,\nand aging play an additive role. The current state of knowledge\nreflects that adverse intrauterine milieu is linked with\naltered environmental, molecular, and epigenetic changes in\noffspring of dysmetabolic mothers.\n5.1. Pregnancy Acts as a Proinflammatory State—Does Inflammation\nPlay a Key Role? Yet in early stages of development,\nplacenta cells, such as Hofbauer cells as well as syncytiotrophoblasts\nand cytotrophoblasts, contribute to local as well\nas systemic levels of cytokines and inflammatory molecules\n[60]. In the course of pregnancy, the physiological role of placental\nproduced cytokines is rarely understood. A common\nhypothesis is that these cytokines contribute to the low grade\nsystemic inflammation during gestation [60]. There is also\nthe assumption that the activation of inflammatory pathways\nis needed to induce maternal insulin resistance, which is\nphysiological up to a certain grade of insulin resistance\nduring pregnancy. However, in dysmetabolic pregnancies,\nfor instance, complicated by diabetes, continuous adverse\nstimuli are associated with the dysregulation of metabolic\nand vascular as well as inflammatory pathways assisted\nby increased circulating concentration of inflammatory\nmolecules [34, 43, 60].\nSince pregnancy by itself mimics the Metabolic Syndrome\nup to a certain level by featuring dysmetabolic\nconditions, such as obesity as well as insulin resistance, and\nis frequently accompanied by dyslipidemia and hypertension,\neven in physiological pregnancies, it is believed that\nmaternal adipose tissue contributes to the inflammatory\nstate of pregnancy, for example, by releasing common\nmolecules as the placenta does [34, 43, 60]. To exemplify,\nthe production of tumor-necrosis-factor- (TNF-) α as well\nas leptin is associated with an increased production for\nadditional inflammatory markers, fibrotic response, vascular\nremodeling, and protein facilitating lipid storage within the\nplacenta [34, 43, 60].\nIt is described that obesity and type 2 diabetes process\nstimuli within the adipose cell to increase the production of\ninflammatory cytokines [34, 43, 60] and that the subsequent\nrecruitment of macrophages enhances the local production\nof cytokines by adipocytes and stromal cells [34, 43, 60].\nNext to cumulative cytokine productions, there are further\nstimuli, such as oxidative stress and endothelial injury, which\nare disbalancing metabolic conditions towards dysmetabolic\nenvironment [34, 43, 60, 61]. Proinflammatory cytokines,\nfor instance, TNF-α and IL-6, affect glucose and lipid\nmetabolism in a negative way and inhibit actions in insulin\nsensitive tissues [34, 43, 60–64]. However, multiple mechanisms\nand pathways act simultaneously rectified, as well as\nopposed by sharing the same or using different pathways.\nCytokines may even cause different effects depending on\ntheir cell type or developmental stage [34, 43, 60–64].\nEven if TNF-α and IL-6 bind to different receptor classes,\nNFκB as a joint transcription factor may be recruited [34, 43,\n60–70]. In this course, NFκB regulates several endogenous\ngenes within pro-inflammatory pathways [34, 43, 60–69] and\neven triggers proinflammatory responses, for example, by\nbinding on the TNF-α gene promoters and therefore looping\ninflammatory response [34, 43, 60–69].\nTaken together, severe obese as well as diabetic pregnancies\nare associated with the disbalance of pro-inflammatory\n', 'ISRN Pediatrics 7\npathways supported by increased circulating concentrations\nof inflammatory molecules [34, 43, 60–69]. In presence,\nit may assumed that placental pro-inflammatory cytokines,\nincluding leptin, which acts as an adipocytokine, as well as\nadipose tissue contribute to the inflammatory state during\npregnancy. It is also described that cytokines have different\neffects on different organs and developmental stages. To\nexemplify, an accumulation of TNF-α is associated with an\nincreased production of pro-inflammatory markers, fibrotic\nresponse, vascular remodeling, and proteins facilitating lipid\nstorage [34, 43, 60–69, 71].\n5.2. Pregnancy Acts as a State of Oxidative Stress—Does\nOxidative Stress Play a Key Role? Pregnancy is characterized\nby dynamic changes and increased susceptibility to\noxidative stress [15, 72–74]. The susceptibility to oxidative\nstress reflects results of disturbances within the prooxidantantioxidant\nbalance due to increasing basal oxygen con-\nsumption as well as changes in energy substrate use by\nmultiple organs, including the fetoplacental unity [15, 72–\n74]. In the early pregnancy, the placenta holds a hypoxic\nenvironment. In the course of gestation, it changes to an\noxygen-rich environment and its abundant mitochondrial\nmass promotes the production of reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) [15, 72–74]. Furthermore, nitric oxide (NO) is also\nproduced by the placenta [15, 72–74] and in addition to\nother reactive nitrogen species the potential to oxidative\nstress is increased. Furthermore, the placenta is very rich\nin macrophages promoting the placental production of free\nradicals [15, 72–74], For example.\nIn a pregnancy with a physiological metabolic state, the\nplacental environment is able to induce protective mechanisms\nagainst free radicals as gestation goes on [15, 72–74].\nCounterregulation mechanisms in normal pregnancies are\nmodulated by enzymatic inductions and activities such as\ngluthatione peroxidase, transferase and reductase, or glucose\n6-phosphate dehydrogenase [15, 72–78] as well as due to\nnonenzymatic free radical protectors and scavengers, such as\nantioxidants like vitamin C and E [15, 72–79].\nIn general, pregnancy is a very sensitive state, in which\nthis equilibrium can be easily disturbed causing dysbalance\ntowards oxidative stress leading to insulin resistance, gestational\ndiabetes, and gestational hypertension, which are often\nassociated [72–78, 80, 81]. Moreover, hyperglycemia per se\ncan promote nonenzymatic glycation, which is able to induce\nROS formation in the presence of reactive transitional metals\n[72–78, 80, 81]. This hypothesis got supported by evidences\nthat elevated ROS in insulin resistance [72–78, 80–82] and\ndiabetes and on the other side the prevention of diabetic fetal\nmalformations by the reduction of oxidative stress seem to\nbe linked [72–78, 80–84].\nWith respect to Simmons et al. understanding of interactions\nwithin the pathogenesis of diabetes, mitochondrial\ndysfunction and oxidative stress got clearly improved [15],\nso oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are discussed\nwithin pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes as well as in\nintrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) [2, 15, 85–88]. In\nfetuses with manifested IUGR, low oxygen levels process the\nproduction of free radicals [15, 86–88]. Selak et al. suggested\nthat decreased pyruvate oxidation in muscle mitochondria of\nIUGR rats is linked to reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\nproduction and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, which may\nbe related to altered ATP synthesis in muscles, e.g., glucose\ntransport, glycogen synthesis causing insulin resistance and\ntype 2 diabetes [87]. Morino et al. suggested that “defects\nin mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity in [. . .]\noffspring of parents with type 2 diabetes” may be linked [88].\nThere is rich evidence that embryos, fetuses, and children\nof diabetic mothers show higher rates of malformations and\nanomalies, which seems to be related to mechanisms of\noxidative stress, hyperglycemia-induced ROS, mitochondrial\ndysfunction and altered glycosylation, peroxidation, and so\nforth [15, 72, 89–93].\nLittle is known about vulnerable time windows during\npregnancy, in which dysbalances towards oxidative stress\ntriggering insulin resistance and diabetes might happen.\nThere is evidence that activation of the hexosamine pathway\ncauses oxidative stress through depletion of GSH altering\ngene expression, which may lead to malformations and\nanomalies [91]. Other investigations describe a correlation\nbetween maternal and fetal oxidative stress by analyzing\numbilical cord blood and infant’s blood, for example, up\nto an age of 3 days [93]. However, there are reports that\nantioxidants improve early fetal damage [72]. Furthermore,\nit could be displayed by analyzing in vivo studies that the\nsupplementation of antioxidants, such as Vitamin E, may\nreduce the rates of malformations [84]. However, as the case\nmay be further analyses have to be done.\n6. Epigenetic Mechanisms of Diabetic and\nMetabolic Programming\nEpigenetic mechanisms are clearly important pathways altering\nthe developmental genome. Hence, epigenetic conditions\ncan be shifted by different environmental factors leading\nto an adverse intrauterine, but also to an adverse postnatal\nenvironment [94, 95]. With great respect to Rebecca Simmons\nand her work the next section will focus basically\non her expertise. In our opinion she already discribed\nmechanisms of epigenetic regulations particularly [95]. By\nciting Simmons an outstanding characterization is given. “An\nadverse intrauterine milieu can impact the development of\nthe fetus by modifying gene expression in both pluripotential\ncells and terminally differentiated, poorly replicating cells.\nThe long-range effects on the offspring (into adulthood)\ndepend upon cells undergoing differentiation, proliferation,\nor functional maturation at the time of the disturbance\nin maternal fuel economy” [95]. Currently it is known\nthat “there are at least two distinct classes of epigenetic\ninformation that can be inherited with chromosomes” [95].\nOne “class of epigenetic regulation is DNA methylation,\nin which a nucleic acid base is modified by a DNA\nmethyltransferase at the C5 position of cytosine” [95].\n“DNA methylation is [. . .] associated with gene silencing\nand contributes to X-chromosomal inactivation, genomic\n', '8 ISRN Pediatrics\nimprinting as well as transcriptional regulation of tissuespecific\ngenes during cellular differentiation” [95].\nThe other “class of epigenetic control of gene expression\ninvolves changes in chromatin proteins” causing histone\nmodifications [95] “by acetylation, methylation, sumoylation,\nphosphorylation, glycosylation, and ADP ribosylation”\n[95]. In general, “the most common modifications involve\nacetylation and methylation of lysine residues” of the\nhistones H3 and H4 [95]. “Increased acetylation induces\ntranscription activation whereas decreased acetylation usually\ninduces transcription repression” [95].\nIn vivo studies were able to show that “abnormal\nintrauterine environment induces epigenetic modifications\nof key genes,” which are, for instance, involved in the regulation\nof β-cell development or causing “hypomethylation\nand hyperacetylation of genomic DNA in brain and liver”\n[95], for example. “Hypomethylation of the glucocorticoid\nreceptor” [. . .] “in the liver of the offspring” can also be\ninduced by maternal low protein intake [95]. Within this\ncontext, important experiments were done by using agouti\nmice [95, 96]. “In the agouti mouse, mutations in the\nregulatory region of the agouti locus cause mice bearing\nthe dominant “viable yellow” (Avy), ”IAPyellow” (Aiapy), or\n”hypervariable yellow” (Ahvy) alleles to synthesize [. . .] more\npheomelanin than eumelanin” [95]. However, modifications\n“by methylation reside within parasitic DNA elements\nor retrotransposons, such as endogenous retrovirus” [95].\nUnder normal circumstances “a cryptic promoter within\nthe retrotransposon is silenced by methylation allowing\nnormal tissue-specific and regulated agouti expression”\n[95]. Under hypomethylation, the promoter gets active and\n“drives constitutive ectopic expression of the agouti gene,\nleading to [. . .] obesity, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes, increased\nsomatic growth, and increased susceptibility to hyperplasia,\nand tumorigenesis” [95]. Moreover, it could be “shown\nthat the methylation status of these inserted viral DNA\nsequences can be modified by the methionine, folic acid\nand choline content of the maternal diet” [95]. By adding\n“methyl donors to the maternal diet [. . .] methylation of the\nretrotransposon” was increased leading to suppressed ectopic\ngene expression and improved outcome in the offspring\n[95–98]. But “epigenetic modification of gene expression”\ncan also happen in the postnatal period [95]. Weaver et al.\nshowed that “stress-induced behaviors of rat mothers during\nlactation” period induced DNA methylation in their suckling\noffspring [95].\n7. Conclusions\nFacing an obese and diabetic epidemic, which affects all\ngenerations, especially younger generations, and experiencing\nalready that obese as well as diabetic mothers increase\nthe risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in their offspring\nsignificantly at an early stage of life by “programming” them\nmetabolically, but also for cardiovascular disease later in\nlife, the research on cross-generational programming has\na fundamental impact in understanding novel molecular\nmechanisms of imprinting diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular\ndisease.\nIn conclusion, it could be shown that different mechanisms\nare able to alter the intrauterine environment.\nHowever, cross-generational programming of metabolic and\ncardiovascular diseases is still poorly understood and further\ninvestigations will give novel insights targeting these the\ncomplex imprinting mechanisms.\nReferences\n[1] World Health Organization (WHO), http://www.who.int/\nmediacentre/factsheets/.\n[2] D.
