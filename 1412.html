        <pre>['CHRONOLOGY\nINTERNATIONAL\nEast versus West\nNov. 16—-The Communist-led Second World Peace \nCongress, transferred from England because of \nBritish inhospitality, opens in Warsaw. It is at\xad\ntended by more than 2,000 delegates from 60 \ncountries.\nNov. 19-—The harmony of the World Peace Con\xad\nference is broken as O. John Rogge, former As\xad\nsistant United States Attorney General, declares \nthat the Cominform countries and not the United \nStates had to resort to war “ to give the revolu\xad\ntion a  violent shove here and there.”  To the \nloud boos of the audience, he declares that he \nwould not now sign the Stockholm peace appeal \nbecause attempts by Cominform countries to ac\xad\ncomplish changes by violence are a greater threat \nto peace than the atomic or hydrogen bomb.\nNov. 22— The World Peace Congress concludes its \nsessions by adopting a 10-point program that in\xad\ncludes a  demand that the International Court \nof Justice examine Gen. MacArthur’s responsi\xad\nbility for “ ruthless measures of destroying the \ncivil population” during Korean military opera\xad\ntions.\nThe Far East\nNov. 6— A Peiping radio broadcast says that the \nChinese Communist Government has demanded \nthat India withdraw troops stationed in Tibet \nto protect trade routes and maintain communi\xad\ncations. Indian sources have no comment to \nmake on the broadcast, but it is conceded that \nwith invading Communist forces but 60 miles \nfrom Lhasa, such a move is a logical one for \nthe Chinese Government to make.\nNov. 7— The American State Department an\xad\nnounces that a “ standard general agreement”  for \nUnited States assistance under the Point Four \nProgram has been signed by the Ceylonese Gov\xad\nernment. Although the agreement is the second \nPoint Four pact to be concluded formally, it dif\xad\nfers from the Iranian measure in that it is of \nthe “ umbrella”  type, rather than for specific \nprojects.\nNov. 1"— Dispatches from China published in the \nRussian press continue to stress the idea that \nChinese soldiers entering Korea, described as \nvolunteers, have as their purpose the complete \nliquidation of the threat to China’s security that \nPeiping declares has arisen from United States\noperations on the Korean peninsula. The re\xad\nports make it clear that the Peiping Government \nhas decided that United States operations in \nKorea, United States action with respect to For\xad\nmosa, and American bombings in Manchuria \nconstitute a  “ direct” threat to China’s security.\nNov. 16— The United States formally denies before \nthe Far Eastern Commission that the United \nStates Army is using Japanese troops in the \nKorean war, as charged by Russia on Nov. 2.\nNov. 17— The Peiping radio derides assurances by \nPresident Truman that the United States has \nno aggressive intentions against China. State\xad\nments by the President and Secretary of State \nAcheson “ are not convincing anyone here,”  says \nthe broadcast.\nNov. 20— Prime Minister Nehru of India declares \nthat his government accepts the 1941 McMahon \nline, which fixes the country’s northeastern \nboundaries with Tibet, rather than the line in\xad\ndicated in Chinese maps, which have represented \ncertain areas “which are in India as not belong \nto India.”  He asserts that “ we stand by that \nboundary and will not allow anyone to cross it.”\nNov. 23— Communist China charges officially that \nFrench ground and air forces in Indo-China have \ncarried out numerous “ provocative invasions” of \nChinese territory in the southern border \nprovinces. Peiping warns the French Govern\xad\nment that it will be held responsible for the con\xad\nsequences of alleged “ shameless, barbaric be\xad\nhavior” of its troops.\nThe British Foreign Office reports that the \nBritish Government, on its own initiative, has \nsent a message to the Chinese Communist au\xad\nthorities assuring the Pciping regime that United \nNations forces in Korea have no designs on \nChina or Chinese interests. The message is \ntaken as an indication of the unease felt in \nEurope that the Western democracies may be\xad\ncome involved in a long and fruitless conflict \nwith Communist China as a  result of the inter\xad\nvention of Chinese forces in the Korean war.\nNov. 24— The American Government makes public \nits outline for the long-awaited treaty for Japan  \nand calls for renewed 4-power consideration of \nformer Japanese territories already pledged or \nnow in the hands of the Soviet Union. The chief \nAmerican proposal, and the one found most ob\xad\njectionable by Russia, calls for a joint decision by \nthe United States, Russia, Britain and China \nfor determining the future of Formosa.\nNov. 30— The Peiping People’s  D aily, official party\n50\n', 'Chronology 51\norgan, publishes an editorial reiterating 3 de\xad\nmands as China’s conditions for peace in the Far \nEast. These are: withdrawal of United Nations \ntroops from Korea, withdrawal of the Seventh \nFleet from Formosa and a place for the Peiping \nregime in the United Nations.\nGen. MacArthur, in answer to a cabled query, \ninforms The New York Times that he “has re\xad\nceived no suggestions from any authoritative \nsource that in the execution of its mission the \n(Korean United Nations) Command should stop \nat the Thirty-eighth Parallel or Pyongyang or at \nany other line short of the international bound\xad\nary.”\nDec. 1— In a copyrighted interview, Gen. Mac\xad\nArthur says that orders forbidding him to strike \nacross the Korean border at the Chinese Com\xad\nmunists are putting the United Nations forces \nunder “ an enormous handicap, without precedent \nin military history.”  He terms the situation in \nKorea critical but not helpless in view of the \ntremendous resources that the free nations can \nstill throw into the fight.\nThe Near East\nNov. 16—Before a wildly cheering Parliament, \nPremier Mustafa Nahas Pasha of Egypt demands \nthat Britain get out of the Suez Canal zone and \nthe Anglo-Egyptian Sudan immediately. He \nthreatens to cancel forthwith the treaty that per\xad\nmits Britain to keep troops in the canal zone until \n1956, and also to cancel agreements for joint \nadministration of the Sudan. He bases his de\xad\nmand on the ground that “ it openly conflicts \nwith the provisions of the United Nations Char\xad\nter, and the conditions under which it was con\xad\ncluded have changed.”\nNov. 21— In a reply to the Egyptian Government’s \ndemand for cancellation of its 1936 treaty, \nBritish Foreign Secretary Bcvin makes it plain \nthat British troops will not leave the Suez Canal \nzone. He assures other Middle East countries \nconcerned that Britain “ has no intention of tak\xad\ning steps or agreeing to any measures which \nwould leave the Middle East defenseless, or \nwould needlessly prejudice the safety of free \nand friendly countries in that area or elsewhere.”\nNov. 27— Premier Nuri As-Said of Iraq tells his \nConstitutional Union Party, which has a majority \nin the Baghdad Parliament, that Britain’s treaty \nof alliance with Iraq has become obsolete. He \nsays that no foreign power should have peace\xad\ntime bases in Iraq, and he also supports Egypt’s \ndemand that British troops leave the Suez Canal \nzone.\nThe United Nations\nNov. 4—-Yugoslav Foreign Minister Kardelj pro\xad\nposes before the Political and Security Committee \nthat the United Nations label as the aggressor \nin any armed conflict any nation that does not \nagree to cease fire and withdraw within 48 hours \nafter the start of a war.\nThe General Assembly, by 38 to 10, with 12 \nnations abstaining, votes to lift its 1946 restric\xad\ntions against the Spanish Government of Gen\xad\neralissimo Francisco Franco. The ban is thus \nrevoked on sending ambassadors or ministers to \nMadrid and on the participation of the present \nSpanish Government in specialized agencies of \nthe United Nations.\nNov. 6-—In a report to the "United Nations, Gen. \nMacArthur identifies the Chinese Communists \nas the “ alien”  forces who are aiding the North \nKoreans. At the same time, the United States \nlays the question of this intervention before the \nSecurity Council.\nNov. 7— The Interim Committee on Korea declares \nin effect that the Korean-Manchurian border \nwill be respected by United Nations forces. The \naction is explained as a move to reassure the \nChinese Communists in case their military ac\xad\ntions spring from fears concerning the frontier. \nIt is not made clear whether the declaration ap\xad\nplies only to breaches of the border or also to \npower supply from dams spanning the frontier.\nNov. 8—By a vote of 8 to 2, with Nationalist China \nand Cuba opposed and Egypt abstaining, the \nSecurity Council extends an invitation to Com\xad\nmunist China to take part in the discussion of \nGen. MacArthur’s charges that Peiping troops \nhave intervened in North Korea. Earlier the \nCouncil defeats a Russian resolution to invite \nthe Peiping regime to take part in all discussions \nof the Korean question.\nThe Special Political Committee of the Gen\xad\neral Assembly opens debate on the problem of \nEritrea, former Italian colony on the Red Sea. \nThree proposals are made that the former colony \nbe constituted a self-governing unit of a federa\xad\ntion with Ethiopia, that it be re-united with \nEthiopia save for a small western segment under \nBritish administration, or that United Nations \ntrusteeship be applied for 10 years after which \nEritrea will be independent.\nNov. 9— The Political and Security Committee, \nwhich has been building machinery to prepare \nit to act against aggression, votes against the \nSoviet bloc in favor of a Yugoslav resolution \nproviding that countries involved in a war an\xad\nnounce within 24 hours that they are ready to \ncease hostilities. The Yugoslav proposal also asks \ncountries at war to open their doors at once to \nthe newly-formed Peace Observation Commission \nto allow it to make an investigation.\nThe Soviet Union formally requests that the\n', "52 Current History, January, 1951\nUnited Nations grant “independence immedi\xad\nately” to Eritrea and order Britain’s “occupation \nforces”  out of the Red Sea territory within 90 \ndays.\nNov. 10— The Indian Ministry of External Affairs \nsays in New Delhi that the Government of Tibet \nhas appealed directly to the United Nations to \nuse its good offices for “peaceful settlement” of \nChinese-Tibetan relations. The Lhasa Govern\xad\nment accuses the Peiping regime of “unprovoked \ninvasion”  of its peaceful territory at a time when \nthe Dalai Lam a’s representatives were about to \nproceed to Peiping to continue negotiations.\nThe Western powers introduce in the Security \nCouncil a  resolution calling on Communist China \nto withdraw its forces from Korea and at the \nsame time assuring the Peiping Government that \nboth its territory and its “ legitimate”  interests \nin the frontier zone will be protected.\nNov. 11— Communist Chinese Foreign Minister \nChou En-lai sends a  cablegram to Lake Success \nsaying that his government refuses an invitation \nto reply in the Security Council to Gen. Mac-' \nArthur’s charges that its troops are fighting in \nKorea. The Peiping regime, however, accepts an \nearlier invitation to testify on the case of For\xad\nmosa. Chou En-lai advises the United Nations \nthat Communist China will discuss the Korean \n' problem on its own terms— that Formosa and \nKorea be regarded as part of the same picture \nof “American aggression.”\nNov. 15— Acting in response to a  warning from \nJohn Foster Dulles, who says that all of South\xad\neast Asia is threatened with “ aggressive war” as \na result of the policy of Communist China, the \nPolitical and Security Committee postpones dis\xad\ncussion of the Formosa question until it has dis\xad\nposed of all other items before it.\nThirty-eight nations, at the latest count, have \nrallied in support of the United Nations war in \nKorea with specific pledges of military and eco\xad\nnomic assistance. Ground, air and naval units of \n15 countries are now in action or en route.\nIn a surprise move, El Salvador demands im\xad\nmediate debate by the General Assembly on the \nChinese invasion of Tibet. Several delegations \nmade it plain that there will be a  move to try \nto persuade El Salvador to withdraw her request.\nNov. 16—Jacob A. Malik announces that he will \nveto a resolution calling for the withdrawal of \nChinese Communist forces in Korea. The Soviet \ndelegate also says that the United States, through \nPresident Truman’s announcement on June 27 \nthat no attack on Formosa would be permitted, \nwas guilty of a “direct aggression”  against the \nChinese People’s Republic.\nNov. 17— The Soviet delegation announces that it \nwill agree to special high-level meetings of the\nSecurity Council to review world problems if \nCommunist China is represented. Thus the Soviet \nUnion agrees to the idea, first suggested by \nTrygve Lie, of bringing the foreign ministers of \nthe 11 Council nations together so that they can \nhave some off-the-record talks about the state of \nthe world.\nNov, 18— El Salvador officially asks the General \nAssembly to adopt a resolution condemning Com\xad\nmunist China’s invasion of Tibet as an act of \n“unpr.ovoked aggression;”\nSenator Sparkman of the United States dele\xad\ngation tells the General Assembly, debating the \n10-point program for peace through negotiation \nput forward by Trygve Lie, that Russia will ac\xad\ncept a program for world peace only on terms \nalready put forward by Moscow and rejected by \nthe United Nations. He declares that the Soviet \nproposals would put the United Nations at the \nmercy of the veto, would “ bulldoze”  it into ac\xad\ncepting Communist China and would force the \nworld to adopt an atomic control plan without \neffective safeguards.\nNov. 21— Dr. T . F. Tsiang, Chinese delegate, calls \nfor a fact-finding commission to look into his \ngovernment’s charges that Russia is threatening \nthe peace of the Far East by backing and dom\xad\ninating the Chinese Communists.

Tsiang withdraws his demand for a com\xad\nmission to investigate his charges that Russian \naid to Communist China amounts to a  breach \nof the peace. Although the United States an\xad\nnounced approval of the proposal, opposition \ncomes from Britain, France, Australia, Canada \nand Belgium.\nNov. 24— The Political and Security Committee of \nthe General Assembly adopts a Soviet resolution \ninviting Communist China to take part in dis\xad\ncussions of United States “ aggression” against \nChina.

John Foster Dulles replies by \naccusing the Soviet Union of trying to “kill” the \nlong-standing friendship between China and the \nUnited States. Among those present at the de\xad\nbate in the Political and Security Committee is \nthe Communist Chinese delegation.\nNov. 28— Warren Austin] American representative \nin the Security Council, accuses Communist \nChina of “ open and notorious” aggression in \nKorea and asks whether it wants peace or war in \nthe Far East.

He adds that the Chinese People’s Re\xad\npublic will not recognize any action by the Se\xad\ncurity Council, particularly regarding Asia, as \nlong as the “Kuomintang reactionary remnant \nclique”  holds China’s seat in the United Nations. \nHe demands that the Council “ condemn, and take \nconcrete steps to apply severe sanctions”  against \nthe United States for its “ criminal act of armed \naggression against the territory of Taiwan (For\xad\nmosa), and armed intervention in Korea.”\nNov. 29—Striking back at “ distortions, slanders, \nhalf truths and outright lies” in the 10,000-word \nstatement yesterday by Wu Hsiu-chuan, Warren \nAustin calls on the Security Council to shelve \nCommunist China’s “ fantastic”  charges and vote \non a resolution calling for the withdrawal of the \nPeiping government’s troops from Korea.\nNov. 30—As Jacob Malik vetos a resolution calling \nfor the withdrawal of Chinese Communist troops \nfrom Korea, the United States delegation an\xad\nnounces that it will present the question to the \nGeneral Assembly next week.\nDec. 1— Indian representative Sir Benegal Rau has\na 50-minute talk with Chinese Communist \nspokesman, Wu Hsiu-chuan, over the possibility \nof a peaceful settlement of Peiping’s intervention \nin Korea.

The new credit is to run \nfor 6 months and is understood to bear interest \nat 3.5 per cent. The Board says that its aim is \nto avoid recourse by the Germans to their rights \nto restore import negotiations, which would run \ncounter to the efforts of the Marshall Plan Coun\xad\ncil to free 75 per cent of the intra-European im\xad\nports from such restrictions by Feb.\nNov. 13—The 12 North Atlantic delegates agree on \nthe need for speed in settling the question of \nGermany’s participation in the defense of \nWestern Europe.

The \nAssembly is split between those who, with the \nBritish, the Scandinavians and some of the low \ncountries, want to hold the Council to a  modest \nadvisory role and those who, like the French, \nwant the Assembly to assert itself and wrest from \nthe governments a  limited authority to act as a \nParliament of Europe.\nNov. 19— Reports from Frankfort say that, in the \nopinion of Western military experts, a Russian \nattack in Europe can be checked only if the \nNorth Atlantic powers, especially France and \nGermany, mobilize a greater number of divisions \nand tactical aircraft than is now contemplated. \nThis is because a Russian move westward would \nbe accompanied by offensives in the Middle and \nFar East which would pin down American and \nBritish forces and throw the main burden of \ndefense of the Continent upon the Europeans \nthemselves.\nNov. 22— The General Affairs Committee of the \nCouncil of Europe votes to call for the formation \nwithout delay of an all-European army that \nwould include German units. The Western na\xad\ntions decide to appeal the matter to the North \nAtlantic pact powers.

Winston Churchill, \nleader of the Opposition, announces that Mr. \nBevin’s views command general assent from the \nConservatives. But from the Labor benches come \nexpressions of disappointment that the govern\xad\nment does not appear to think that the time has \ncome to try to reach a settlement of world dif\xad\nferences at the council table.\nNov. 15— Harold Wilson, President of the Board \nof Trade, reveals that exports from the United \nKingdom reach a post-war record in Oct.

MacArthur \ncharges the “ Communists” with “one of the most \noffensive acts of international lawlessness of his\xad\ntoric record”  by intervening in and in effect re\xad\nnewing the Korean war after the thorough defeat \nof the North Korean armies. He says that \n“ alien” forces have massed “ a great concentra\xad\ntion”  in the “privileged sanctuary”  of Chinese \nterritory across the border. The statement makes \nno direct mention of Chinese Communist troops \nin North Korea.\nNov. 7— North Korean and Chinese Communist \nforces continue to press their attack against the \nUnited Nations line in the critical western sector \nof North Korea. Official reports say that the \nenemy fails to break through to their goal— the \ncoastal highway, which is the line of communica\xad\ntions for all United Nations troops in western \nKorea.\nNov. 8—United Nations forces expand their bridge\xad\nhead north and west of the Chongchon River \nin the western sector of the North Korean front \nas the enemy breaks off contact along most sec\xad\ntions of the line after his failure to force a break\xad\nthrough.\nNov. 9— For the first time, Gen. MacArthur’s head\xad\nquarters officially states that strong forces of the \nChinese Communist Army, estimated at 60,000 \nmen, have entered the Korean war with an equal \nnumber of re-inforcements believed to be on the \nway to oppose the United Nations march to the \nManchurian border.\nNov. 10— As United States Far East Air Forces \ncontinue their attacks on border points where \ntroops and supplies from Communist China are \nbeing assembled, the Korean front is relatively \nquiet for the fifth consecutive day.

MacArthur announces the launch\xad\ning of a “general assault” by the United Nations \nforces in the Western sector of the Korean front \nin a movement to close a vise on enemf positions \nsouth of the Yalu River. He pictures the newly- \nbegun assault as the final battle to end the war. \nOne hundred thousand United Nations forces \nroll ahead in the huge general assault to end the \nwar by Christmas. The attack is made against \nalmost no resistance. Gen. MacArthur says that \n“ an air reconnaissance behind the enemy’s lines \nand along the entire length of the Yalu River \nborder showed little sign of hostile military ac\xad\ntivity.”\nNov. 26— Strong enemy counter-attacks led by sol\xad\ndiers of the Chinese Communist armies stall the \nUnited Nations general offensive drive toward \nthe Manchurian frontier on the Yalu River. \nAloqg a 25-mile sector of the western front, \nUnited States and South Korean divisions lose \nground. It appears that the Communists are \nseeking to drive a wedge down the Chongjin \nRiver Valley to split Allied forces.\nNov. 27— United Nations forces again retreat in the \nface of new enemy attacks reported to involve \n60,000 Chinese. The key town of Chongju is \nabandoned, and the “ general assault”  to end the \nwar is temporarily stopped in western Korea.\nGen. MacArthur reports that the United Na\xad\ntions faces an “entirely new war” in Korea with \nenemy forces of more than 200,000 men, includ\xad\ning a “major segment” of the Chinese Com\xad\nmunist armies now mustered there. “This situa\xad\ntion, repugnant as it may be, poses issues beyond \nthe authority of the United Nations military com\xad\nmand— issues which must find their solution \nwithin the councils of the United Nations and \nthe chancelleries of the world.” The communique \nis interpreted by some as an appeal for permis\xad\n', '58 Current History, January, 1951\nsion to bomb the “protected bases”  of the Com\xad\nmunists in Manchuria.\nNov. 29— United Nations forces continue to fall \nback under heavy Communist attack to seek a \ndefensive position in the western sector.

The Marines and elements of the \nSeventh Infantry Division, surrounded for the \nlast 36 hours, fight off attacks of “ almost fanati\xad\ncal determination.” In the West the battered \nEighth Army abandons the Chongchon River \ndefense line and takes up new positions about \n30 miles from Pyongyang.\nDec. 3— Chinese Communist armies close in on \nPyongyang while United Nations troops evacuate \nthe city and continue their retreat. The enemy \ncontinues its drive to cut off the isolated Tenth \nCorps, and the encircled Marines in the frozen \nnortheast continue their efforts to fight their way \nout of a Communist trap.\nLIBYA\nNov. 25-—Libya as a political entity in its own right \nis born as the Libyan National Constituent As\xad\nsembly convenes in Tripoli in inaugural session. \nThe first act of the new assembly is to send its \ngreetings to the “ expected King of Libya,” Emir \nSayed Idris el Senussi of Cyrenaica.

The esti\xad\nmates, based on official Soviet statistical reports, \nindicate that in 1949 the national income per \ncapita was equivalent to $308 in 1949 United \nStates dollars. That of the United States is nearly \nfive timees the figure for the U.S.S.R.\nTHAILAND\nNov. 26— The Thai Communist Party issues a \nmanifesto which is believed to signal intensifica\xad\ntion of Communist efforts in Thailand. The \nmanifesto denounces the inadequacies of the gov\xad\nernment of Marshal Luang Pribum Songgram \nand brands the government as an instrument of \n“American imperialism,”  which it charges with \npreparing the country as a base for aggression in \nAsia. The document calls for a “ national demo\xad\ncratic common front”  of laborers, farmers, stu\xad\ndents, intellectuals, merchants, industrialists and \naliens in Thailand to fight for “ independence, \ndemocracy and permanent peace.”\nNov. 20— Reports from Bangkok indicate that \n50,000 Vietnamese refugees have become a major\n', "Chronology 59\nproblem for Thailand as Communist-led Vietminh \nand allied groups step up their drives in Indo- \nChina.

Omar Brad’ey, chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, reveals that when the United \nStates was committed in the Korean war it was \nleft without an adequate margin of military \nstrength to meet a general enemy attack. Conse\xad\nquently, he declares that the American people \nmust be prepared to make community and indi\xad\nvidual sacrifices if we are to reconstruct the \nmilitary strength needed to preserve the free \nworld again't the threat of Communist aggression. \nTo meet this crisis, Bradley maintains that the \nNational Guard and Reserves units must be put \nin an improved state of readiness and that man\xad\npower resources available for industry may have \nto be severely taxed.\nNov. 21— The Defense Department announces that \nthe sharply accelerated defense program has \nresulted in outlavs of $ '2  4 billion in the first 4 \nmonths of the Korean fighting.

Such \na step might lead to a plebiscite on independence, \nand while such a vote would probably be against \nbreaking ties with the United States, the Labor \nCommissioner suggests that the holding of such \na plebiscite will have enormous propaganda value \nfor the Russians.\nFinance and Taxation\nNov. 9—The Department of Commerce reports that \npersonal income in Sept, achieved a new high \nannual rate of $228.3 billion. The rise in per\xad\nsonal income stems partly from a substantial in\xad\ncrease in corporate dividend disbursements.\nNov. 14— President Truman calls for immediate \naction on an excess-profits tax that would increase \nfederal revenues by $4 billion a year. He says \nthat the levy should be retroactive to July 1 \nPublication of the President’s letter coincides with \na demand by Republican representatives for post\xad\nponement of the issue until the Eighty-second \nCongress convenes on Jan. 3.

The \nmain point of the Republican plan is that the \ncorporation would have a choice of either paying \nunder an excess profits tax or at a corporate rate \nof 55 per cent. The present corporate tax is \n25 per cent on the first $25,000 of earnings and \n45 per cent on the rest.\nNov. 21-—The United States Chamber of Com\xad\nmerce calls on Congress to reduce non-military \nexpenditures at least $6 billion before increasing \ntaxes.\nNov. 24— As the House Ways and Means Com\xad\nmittee begins the task of drafting an excess-profits \ntax, Senator Eugene D.

The approved \nformula calls for a 75 per cent levy on earnings \nin excess of 85 per cent of a corporation’s average \nannual earnings during its most profitable 3 years \nfrom 1946 through 1949. The Truman admin\xad\nistration had recommended a 75 per cent rate on \nearnings in excess of 75 per cent of the base- \nperiod average.\nForeign Policy\nNov. 6— In an informal speech in Independence, \nMissouri, President Truman declares that the \nUnited States will not run out on its responsi\xad\nbilities as he says it did in 1920.

He says \nthat export controls have prevented important \nmaterials from reaching China, but he opposes a \nflat embargo on shipments, because of the sig\xad\nnificant value of imports from that area.\nNov. 12— Gordon Gray, president of the University \nof North Carolina and former secretary of the \nArmy, submits to President Truman a special \nreport on United States foreign economic policies. \nHe recommends that aid to Western Europe \nshould continue for 3 or 4 more years while the \nfree world’s defenses are made stronger. The \nreport also advises that aid to underdeveloped \nareas on a more intensive scale is imperative.\nNov. 13— While emphasizing that such aid is neces\xad\nsary and that he favors it, Senator Robert Taft, \nSenate Republican leader, asserts that the scope, \nmethods and character of military aid to Europe \nshould undergo thorough examination by the in\xad\ncoming Eighty-second Congress before fiftal com\xad\nmitments are made.\nNov. 15— Aroused by mounting criticism of the \nState Department and its policies, Secretary \nAcheson defends his department and its per\xad\nsonnel, and appeals for public confidence in the \norganization while it grapples with what he feels \nare the most critical issues ever to face the nation. \nHe warns that the United States must employ \nall its wisdom, and employ it with the utmost \nsoberness and resolution, if it is to prevent the \nentry of Chinese Communist troops in Korea \nfrom causing a world-wide tragedy “ of the most \ncolossal nature.”\nWith no official explanation for the change in \nadministration policy, the Economic Cooperation \nAdministration announces that it will make dollar \nloans to Spain from the $62.5 million fund au\xad\nthorized by Congress for the purpose.\nNov. 16— In a prepared statement that other mem\xad\nbers of the United Nations have been urging the \nUnited States to make for weeks, President Tru\xad\nman re-assures the Chinese Communists that this \ncountry will take every honorable step to avoid \nthe extension of the Korean war into China \nproper or any other part of the Far East.\nInternal Security\nNov. 20— Gordon Dean, chairman of the Atomic \nEnergy Commission, asserts in a national maga\xad\nzine that Klaus Fuchs, the British atomic scientist \nwho turned over valuable information to the\nSoviet Union, advanced the Russian atomic bomb \nresearch one to two years. He also declares that \nthe security requirements in atomic energy plants \npresent a mountainous task and that the time \nmay come when it will be wise to revise present \nsecurity restrictions, even to the point where the \nsize and shape of the bomb can be disclosed \npublicly.\nNov. 30—Congress is asked by the National Security \nResources Board to put full direction of the \nnation’s civil defense into the hands of an ad\xad\nministrator, named by and responsible to the \nPresident. The administrator’s broad powers, \nincluding discretion in matching state expendi\xad\ntures for civil defense on a dollar-for-dollar basis, \nwould be stepped up greatly in the event of enemy \nattack.\nDec. 1—As President Truman signs an executive \norder establishing the Civilian Defense Admin\xad\nistration as an independent agency, he announces \nthe appointment of Millard F.

N. Pritt, to argue their appeal \nbefore the highest legal forum. They say this is \nnecessary because of the refusal of two dozen \nAmerican attorneys to plead the defense. The \ndefendents also ask that the hearings on their \nappeal be deferred from Dec. 4, the date now \nset, until Jan. 22, at which time Pritt will be \nfree to plead their case. Supreme Court attaches \nsay they cannot remember any foreign lawyer \narguing before the court.\nNov. 27— The Supreme Court gives permission for \na British lawyer to aid the 11 Communist de\xad\nfendents in the forthcoming hearing but refuses \nto postpone arguments.
