        <pre>[',\neme:\nVolume 15, No. 237.\nOCALA, FLORIDA, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 2, 1910.\nFilty Cents a Month; C5 o Yecr\nf(E\ntl\'\'\'\'\'"\'"\'\'\'\'\nV4\nCHASTISING THE COMMITTEE\nManatee Joins the List of Counties\nthat Insist on Voting for Judge\nand State Attorney\nBradentown, March 2. In a meet\ning that was well attended, perfectly\nharmonious and entirely unanimous,\nthe county democratic committee of\nManatee county yesterday afternoon\ndeclared that candidates for circuit\njudge and state attorney for the sixth\njudicial circuit should have their\nnames on the ballots to be voted in\nthe coming primary election, thus re\nbuking the action of the state com\nmittee, which declared that such of\nfices should no longer be voted on in\nthe primary, but should become pure\nly appointive offices.\nCONSTIPATED?\nHEADACHE?\nJOHN ROBERTSON\'S\nLATEST PROJECT\n(Citrus County Chronicle)\nHon. J. D. Robertson, mayor of\nOcala, who came to this city with J.\nII. Spencer of the same city in the hit\nter\'s car, accompanied by Mrs. Robert\nson and Miss Mamie Hendon of Geor\ngia, to attend the meeting of the state\nautomobile association, visited the\nTimes office his morning accompanied\nby Hon. A. J. Knight and presented a\nproposition of undoubted merit.\nMayor Robertson is an enthusiastic\nadvocate of good roads, and he has\npractical ideas on the subject. Being\na civil engineer and surveyor he has\nhad experience in this line of work.\nHis proposition is that if the people, of\nTampa will secure the building of an\nair line road from this city to Brooks -\nviiie a continuation of Nebraska av\nenue he will arrange for the con\nstruction of a straight road from Ocala\nto Brooksviile. This would reduce the\ndistance from Tampa to Ocala to\neighty-two miles, a trip which could\nbe made on a good road in an auto\nmobile with all ease in three hours.\nMr. Robertson says he has already\ncanvassed the matter with interested\nparties, and he is assured of coopera\ntion in fact, he felt justified in prom\nising the construction of the roa4\nfrom Ocala to Brooksviile if Tampa\nwill guarantee the road from this city\nto Brooksviile.\nFurther, Mr. Robertson thought\nthere would be little difficulty in hav\ning a road built from Ocala to Jack\nsonville, on an air line. He is appris\ned of a project of the promoters of a\nbig colonization enterprise to build a\nconsiderable portion of such a road.\nThis would reduce the distance from\nTampa to Jacksonville to 164 miles.\nThe matter was discussed last night\nat the automobile club\'s banquet, and\nwas enthusiastically endorsed. Such a\nhighway would prove a source of\ngreat pleasure and convenience to\nFloridians using automobiles, and\nwould induce many visiting automo\nbile owners to tour the state.\n"A crooked road is an abomination,"\ndeclared Mr. Robertson. "Let us build\nnn a straight line, always from one\ncenter of population to another, and\nthe smaller communities could build\nbranch roads to connect with the main\nroad." Tampa Times. Feb. 2S.\nWe do not know of any man who is\nmore enthusiastic than John Robert\nson when it comes to good roads. Out\nof his own private funds, he has sur\nveyed out an air line road from the\nend of the hard surfaced road five\nmiles Mouth of Ocala to Stoke\'s Ferry\nand thence to a point on the Dunnel-lon-Inverness\nhard road near the old\nsyndicate mines, and has had the\nsame grubbed of roots and graded\nand it is a most excellent road for au\ntomobiles. With a little attention, the road\nfrom Inverness to Brooksviile which\nwas recently strawed by the citizens\nInterested in the Times automobile\nrace to Jacksonville, could be kept in\ngood" shape, and could be used until\nthe construction of the hard surfaced\nroad from Inverness to Floral City,\nwhich latter road the board of county\ncommissioners of this county are un\nder promise to""construct as soon as the\nrepairs are completed on the road\nnorth to Dunnelon. With the com\npletion of this road. Citrus county\nwould furnish a hard surfaced road\nia.ll the way through the county, except\nwfcout one and one-half miles on the\nsouthern end. and that could very\neasily be built if Hernando would fall\nin line and build on to Brooksviile.\nA good automobile road does not\nApcssarily need to be a hard surfaced\nroad a sand road is all right if it is\nstraight and clear of stumps and\nroots, with the steeper hills graded\ndown.\nWe here tender to Mr. Robertson\nany services" we may be able to ren\nder him in his project.\nNever forget that there are far\nmore sunny than cloudy days in a\nyear and that there is considerably\nmore sunshine than shadow in the av\nerage life. A poor shivering Italian,\nto whom a man in giving alms re\nmarked that it was very cold, said:\n"Yes, yes, pritty cold; but by and by!\ntink of dat." He was thinking of the\ngenial spring and warm summer with\nblue skies and bright flowers, and in\no doing was taking the right view of\nlife. It may be cloudy and cold some\ntimes, but more often there is sun\nshine and warmth. Gainesville Sun.\ni \' t ri n it\n2i\nState of Ohio, City of Toledo,\nLucas County. ss.\nFrank J.

Blount as a candi\ndate for the United States Senate the\nTrue Democrat declared its intention\nof supporting him. and his declination\nrather left us without choice for the\nposition. But the race has now nar\nrowed down to three candidates. Tal\niaferro, Broward and L\'Engle, and of\nthem we unquestionably prefer the\nformer because we feel that his re\nelection would best subserve the in\nterests of the state. That Senator Tal\niaferro is an able man there can be\nno dispute, and he is beginning to\nwield powerful influence in the na\ntional halls of Congress.\nA state-wide representative should\nwork as conscientiously in the inter\nest of one section as another. It\nseems to us that the interests of Flor\nida\'s west coast ha.s not heretofore\nbeen given the attention it deserves.\nThere are many opportunities for the\nexpenditure of government money\nfrom Apalachicola river to Tampa\nBay, among them our own St. Marks\nharbor, and if Senator Taliaferro will\nget busy and help us out along these\nlines he would bo as popular in this\nsection of the state as he is on the\neast \'coast.

KNIGHT SELLS 140,000 ACRES\n(Citrus County Chronicle)\nWe have known for a long time that\na deal was on foot whereby Mr. It. J.\nKnight was selling his large land\nacreage in this county, but the infor\nmation came in such a way that we\nwere not at liberty to publish it. We\nare very glad, however, to see from\nthe following clipping from the Times\nUnion of the 25th, that the deal has\nbeen finally perltcted:\n"Big real estate transactions are the\norder of the day this winter in Flor\nida. "Every few days comes an announce\nment of large purchases of land, and\nntw colonization plans are becoming\nreally common. One of the latest\ndeals is that made by E. Z.

He\nsold to Thompson & Jackson of Il\nlinois. 140.000 acres in Citrus county.\ni known as the Knight lands.\n"This is one of the finest tracts in\nthe state, being in the citrus fruit belt,\nand the lands are suitable for all kinds\nof agricultural purposes. The land\nwas bought for an investment, and\nwill not be placed on the market as a\nretail proposition for some time.\n"This tract adjoins a larger tract,\nwhich was sold by Mr. Jones to the\nsame parties some time at;o. known as\ntiie Beckwith & Warren lands, also\nthe Bushneli tract, owned by Eugene\nWest, which they also purchased from\nMr. Jones.\n"Both Mr. Thompson and Mr. Jack\nson, with their wives, are now making\na tour in the state, and will spend sev\neral weeks in Florida.

Banner.\nVery good. Don\'t let it escape your\nmemory. If the Banner and the Star\ncan incite the business men of Ocala\nand vicinity into making and sustain\ning such moves, the problem will be\nsolved. Its an entirely practical prop\nosition. No doubt that Mr. Rentz and\nMr. Ray can secure the capital to ex\ntend their roads to deep water if they\ncan only be sure that they will be giv\nen the business to make said roads\npay after they are built. There is\nsufficient business to support railroad\nlines both to Palatka and Port Inglis,\nIf the business men will only stand\ntogether and give their patronage to\nthe people who build the roads. The\nRentz road is the most convenient out\nlet. It is only a little over thirty miles\nfrom its present terminus to Palatka,\nthrough a good country. "When the\nwriter came to Florida, he often saw\ngood sized ocean going vessels at the\nPalatka wharves, and they would\ncome today if there was business for\nthem. There are several firms in New\nYork, Philadelphia and Baltimore who\nmake a specialty of running light draft\nvessels in the coasting trade, and a\ncouple of 500-ton boats could be kept\nbusy. The road to the Gulf through\nDunnellon will be more difficult to\ncomplete, unless an alliance could be\nmade with the Inglis interests, but its\na good scheme to push along. If our\ncontemporary will boost botn enter\nprises, the Star will back it up for all\nIt is worth.\nare anxious and willing, and they con\nsider It their duty to talk for this great\nregion, and they look with pitying\neyes back at their friends and ac\nquaintances who are doing the slav\nery that used to belong especially to\ntheir lot.\n"Ocala is the county seat of Marion\ncounty. It is a thriving city of 7,000\npeople. Two great trunk lines run di\nrectly through Ocala and, likewise, the\nBurbank-Ocala colony. These are the\nAtlantic Coast Line an dthe Seaboard\nAir Line. Distributed all along these\ngreat railroads are the fruit and veg\netable storage warehouses, where the\ngreat commission men and fruit buy\ners come each year and pay the truck\nand fruit growers of Marion county\nhigh prices, right on the spot, for their\nproducts. Then these products are\nloaded into refrigerator cars and sped\nnorthward, at the rate of mail trains,\nto the eager and anxious waiting\nmarkets.\nCANDIDATES ARE COMING OUT\nSeveral more candidates have been\nnominated and are entered in the\nOcala Automobile Voting Contest. All\nhave received the complimentary 1,000\nvotes.

And why\nnot?\n"From $2,500 to $5,000 a year is the\nnet saving of a fully cultivated Flor\nida small farm! It is this fact which\none learns, with the five physical\nsenses, that proves this statement, and\nit is this fact that has made, and is\nmaking this absolute land mania on\nthe part of the public for Florida\nfarms.\n"Take a train, if you will, at New\nYork City or Chicago, and at almost\nevery important junction point people\nwill board that train who are inter\nested in Florida.\n"\'It is estimated that, today, one\nmillion men and women have either\nInvested, or will invest, in Florida.\nSections and townships of this state\nare being populated at the rate of 100\nper cent, increase in a single year.\nTracts of land that but a few months\nago were a tangled mass of rich prairie\nare, today, garden spots, rose gardens;\nand bungalows and pretty cottages are\ndotted over the land.\n"These are hard, cold facts not\nfancies of fiction. They ae sights one\nsees from the Pullman windows as\none travels down over the "Rainbow\nState.\'\n"\'Marion county is. without question,\nthe banner county of Florida. It is not\nan experiment it is a fact. To take an\nautomobile or a carriage and drive ov\ner Marion county is as great a pleas\nure as one could desire. Do not think\nthat you are going to see land where\ndrudgery is the word! Do not think\nthat you are coming to a region where\nthe barn is four times the size of the\nhouse and where nothing but work,\nwork, work stares one in the face\nwherever one may look! In Marion\ncounty the fruit growers and truck\nfarmers live like merchant princes.\nMany of them have their own auto\nmobiles, their homes are beautifully\nlaid out, hot and cold water, tele\nphones, the daily paper, and the food\nthat goes upon the table is of that\nsame quality which we people in the\niNoth are delighted to buy ever and\nanon, at the famous hotels and res\ntaurants, and then speak of. after the\norder of him who goes to a feast.\n"It la positively strange, and almost\nuncanny, to move in and among the\nnew comers, Northern men and wom\nen clerks, expert laborers, office men,\ndoctors, dentists, actors, farmers, me\nchanics, etc. and listen to their tales.\nThese people would not go back to\ntheir former mode of living under any\nconditions. They show you their bank\nbooks, they tell you that what they\nwere for many years.

Bullock has written the\nfollowing letter to Mr. Walter F. War\nnock of this place, and as the judge is\nwriting of a much talked of matter at\nthis time, we publish the letter in\nfull:\n"There seems to be some agitation\nover the question of leaving circuit\njudges off the ticket at the democratic\nprimary election and while I do not\nknow the chairman of your committee,\nI wish you would express my views on\nthe subject if the same becomes ne\ncessary, or the question comes up.\n"I supposed that the state democrat\nic executive committee was the head\nof the party in this state and what\nthey did, the rules they formulated,\nwas to be observed -by persons who\naspired to be democrats. They said\nleave circuit judges off I did not care.\nHad they put them on I would not\nhave cared. I am not sitting in judg\nment on their conduct. I am not de\nfending their actions as within the\nscope of their authority, nor am I de\nfying it and say that I will not be gov\nerned thereby. I think that it ill be\ncomes me to say that they did or did\nnot do that which was correct.\n"Some of the county committee\'s\nhave approved their action and some\nhave repudiated it. What your com\nmittee may do I am not concerned\nabout nor undertake to influence them\none way or another; it is one of the\nresponsibilities with which I am not\ncharged. If your committee should\nsee fit to say the state committee ex\nceeded its authority, and as democrats\nthey are not bound, and direct that\nthe candidate for circuit judge must\ngo on the ticket, then I am perfectly\ncontent and ask to go on in your\ncounty. If they should believe that\nfthe state committee, as a party organ\nization, has declared the proper policy\nand they should not be put on, I am\nquite as well satisfied. In other words,\nif your committee declare that the\nname of circuit judge shall go on. then\'\nplease understand that I am ready tt\npay my assessment and ask to be pt\non: if they adopt the state committer\'s\naction, all is well.\n"Yours very truly.\n\'W.

Office over Martin & Cam.\nCHAPTER XII.\nA NEW PRISONER A REIVES.\nT was far past midnight when Kins\nwas aroused from the doze into\nwhich he had fallen. Was it the\n2Gth? Loud, quick commands\ncame to his ears.\n"They are here at last," he heard\nsome one say. "God! This suspense\nhas been awful. But they are here."\n"Stand ready, then, with the guns!"\ncried Peter Brutus. "It may be a\ntrick, after all. Don\'t open that door\ndown there. Spantz. until you know\nwho is on the outside."\n"It\'s all right," came at last in the\nrelieved, eager voice of Peter Brutus.\n"Clear the way, comrades. Give them\nroom. By our holy father, this is a\nbrave triumph. Ah!"\nHeavy footsteps clogged into the\nroom, accompanied by stertorious j\nbreathing and no small amount of\ngrunting from masculine throats. Sot\none but three or four languages were\nspoken by the excited, intense occu\npants of the other room. King could\nmake nothing of what they said. Final\nly the sharp, incisive voice of Wil\nliam Spantz broke through the babble,\ncommanding silence.\n"Still unconscious," he said when\nsome measure of order was secured.\n"Yes," grunted one of the men.\n"We will have our instructions to\nmorrow. The count is to inform us\nbefore nightfall where she is to be re\nmoved to. Next week she is going to\ngo to Schloss Marlanx." Brutus added\na cruel, heartless laugh.\nA woman, thought Truxton. The\ncountess! They had brought her here\nfrom Balak, after all. What a re\nmorseless brute Marlanx must be to\nmaltreat his beautiful wife!\n\'To my mind she is more beautiful\nthan his own wife," observed Anna\nCromer. "She will be a fine morsel for\nthe count, who has eve" cast longing\neyes on so homely a mortal as 1."\n"All woman are alike to him," said\nSpantz sententiously.\n"We must put her in the room with\nthe American for the present. You are\nsure he will take her away before Sat\nurday? A woman\'s cries are most dis\ntressing." It was Spantz who spoke.\n"I\'ll stop her crying," volunteered\nAnna Cromer harshly.\n"She\'s regaining her senses!" ex\nclaimed one of the men. "Stand back,\nevery one. Give her air."\nPresently the door to Kings room\nwas thrown open. He had got to his\nfeet and was standing in the center\nof the room, his eyes blinking in the\nglare of light.\n"Hello!" cried Teter Brutus. \'You\nup. eh? We\'ve got a fair lady for\nvou. mv friend. Get back there, you\ndog! Keep in your corner."\n"You are a tine bunch of human\nbeings!" blurted Truxton.\nA man with a lighted candle entered\nfirst, holding the light above his head.\nHe was followed by two others, who\nsupported the drooping, tottering fig\nure of a woman.\n"Let her sit there against the wall.\nDrago. Julius, fetch in more candles.\nShe must not be left in the dark. lie\nvays she is not to be frightened to\nleath. Women are afraid of the dark\nind strange dogs. Let there be light."\nfcoffed Peter Brutus, spittiug toward\nXing.\n"I\'ll get you for that some day."\ngrated the American, white with anger.\n"Enough!" commanded William\nSpantz. "We are not children." Turn\ning to King, he went on, a touch of\nkindness in his voice: "Cheer her if\nyou can. She is one of your class. Do\nnot let the lights go out."\nliaising his hands, he fairly drove\nthe others from the doorway.\nFor a time King stood in his corner,\nwatching the figure huddled against\nthe opposite wall. Suddenly he started\nforward, his eyes\nwide and staring.\nHe had seen that\ngray riding habit\nbefore. Two eager\nsteps he took and\nthen halted half\nway. "Great Jeho\nvah!" he gasped,\nunbelieving. "You!\nMy God, is it\nyou?"\nHe dropped to\nhis knees before\nher, peering into\nher startled eyes.\nA look of abject\nterror crossed the\ntired, tear stained face.\naway from him.\n"What is it? Where am I?\'\' she\nmoaned. "Oh, let me go! What have\nI done that you should bring me here?\nLet me go, Mr. King! You are not so\nwicked as"\n"I I bring you here!" he interrupt\ned, aghast. Then he understood. Ut\nter dismay tilled his eyes. "You think\nthat 1 have done this thing to you?\nGod above us! Look! I, too, am a\nprisoner here. They are going to kill\nme after tomorrow."\n"Oh, Mr. King, what does it all\nmean? Forgive me! I see now. You\nare bound; you are suffering; you are\nyears older. What have you done?\nWhat have I doner\'\n"Don\'t shrink from me," he urged.\n"Try to calm yourself."\nThen, with the utmost gentleness, he\npersuaded her to rise and walk about\nthe little room with him.\n"It will give you courage," he urged.\n. "Poor little cirll"\nShe looked up into Ms face, a new\nlight coming into her eyes.\n"Don\'t talk now," he said softly.\n"Take your time. Hold to my arm,\nplease. There!\nFor five or ten minutes he led her\nback and forth across the room very\ntenderly. At first she was faint and\nuncertain; then, as her strength and\nwits came back to her, courage took\nthe place of despair. She smiled wanly\nand asked him to sit down with her.\n"Where are we? What is it all\nabout?" she asked.\n"Not so loud," he cautioned. "I\'ll be\nperfectly candid with you. You\'ll hare\nto be very, very brave. But wait.\nPerhaps it will be easier for you to\ntell me what has happened to you, so\nfar as you know. I can throw light\non the whole situation, I think."\nShe became more excited. Her eyes\nflashed; she spoke rapidly. On the\nmorning of the 23d she had gone for\nher gallop in the famous Ganlook road,\nattended by two faithful grooms from\nthe royal stables.\n"I was in for -a longer ride than usu\nal," she said, with sudden constraint.\nShe looked away from her eager listen\ner. "I was nervous and had not slept\nthe night before. A girl never does,\nI suppose."\nHe looked askance. "Yes?" he que\nried. She was blushing, he was sure of\nit "I mean a girl is always nervous\nand distrait after after she has prom\nised, don\'t you see."\n"No; I don\'t see."\n"I had promised Count Voa Engo the\nnight before that I Oh, but it really\nhas nothing to do with the story. I"\nTruxton was actually glaring at her.\n"You mean that you had promised to\nmarry Count Vos Engo!" he stammer\ned. "How very strangely you talk! Are\nyou sure I mean, do you think it is\nfever? One suffers so"\nHe sighed deeply. "Well, that\'s\nover! Whew! It was a dream, by\nJove!"\nShe waited a moment and then, look\ning down, said very gently, "I\'m so\nsorry for you."\nThen she resumed her story.\n(Concluded Tomorrow)\nkid\nALLEN\'S\nLUNG\nBALSAM\nFor deep-seated\nCOUGHS.\nCOLDS.\nCROUP.\nA 2jc.

It has bought grounds for\nterminal facilities, and will soon be\ncome a live factor in our "develop\nment. The road, besides being completed\nto Ocala. will also be completed to\nDunnellon. and it is believed will\nmake some sort of a deal with the\nPort Inglis railroad and will give\nOcala an outlet to that port.\nThe Rentz road (a new one) is\npushing on from Ocala to Palatka.\nand we have faith in getting the G. &\nG. from Fairfield, and if railroads\nmake a city Ocala ought quickly to\ndevelop into one. and it is making\nquite lively strides in that direction.\nMessrs.

Three carloads of\nfine cows were just shipped down the\neast coast, and the local demand is\n(constantly growing greater.\nWe were shown some hogs that\nwere almost as big as bears.

Mr. Chambliss said that the\nlargest one would weigh fully six\nhundred pounds.\nThe Palmetto farm is a big adver\ntisement for Marion county, for it\nshows not only the possibilities but\nthe actualities of our soil, and aH we\nclaim for this section is here fully\ndemonstrated.\nII. r- we find tine cattU-. fine hogs\nand plenty of fine stuff to feed them\non.\nMessrs.
