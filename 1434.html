        <pre>["Metropolis: 1985 \nDOUGLAS S. POWELL1 \nPlanning Director, Regional Plan Association, Inc., New York City \n \nTODAY'S youth faces a new American \nrevolution—a revolution that I venture to \npredict will be as significant to the survival \nand growth of our nation as the battle for \nindependence through which our nation was \nborn. But unlike that earlier revolt, waged \nagainst foreign tyranny, the new American \nrevolt will be waged against an internal \nenemy, for today the people in American \ncities and suburbs are caught up in a \nstruggle against the rising tyranny of urban \nslums and blight, urban congestion, \ndeteriorating urban transportation, and the \nsocial breakdown of whole urban \ncommunities. The fight now being joined is \naimed at freeing a growing segment of the \nAmerican population from the slavery of \nslum life and freeing all of us from the \nalarming drains on our social and economic \nstrengths that result from slum-burdened \ncities. \n \nWhy are we now faced with a revolt against \nurban deterioration when as a nation we \nhave lived with slums, urban congestion and \nall of the other ills of the modern city for \nalmost a century? \n \nTwo reasons probably override all others. \nFirst of all, we are now so conclusively an \nurban nation that it is abundantly clear to all \nof us that the ills of our urban areas are the \nills of the nation. I hardly need to set down \nthe usual statistics to prove this point. \nSuffice it to say that today and in the future, \nvirtually all of this nation's burgeoning \npopulation growth will occur in our 175 to \n200 metropolitan centers. \n \nSecondly, we are now beginning to get \nsome results from recent postwar research. \nThese results tell us a great deal about the \neconomic and social forces shaping our \nAmercian metropolitan areas. They confirm \nthe uneasiness that all of us living in \nmetropolitan centers have felt from our own \nobservations of slums and experiences in \nthe mounting congestions of urban life: that \nserious problems challenging the very \nwelfare of the cities and the nation are on \nthe horizon. \nTHE NEW YORK STUDY \n \nIn the New York region we are now \nreceiving the results of a three-year \n$600,000 study aimed at giving us a picture \nof the kind of metropolitan area we may \nhave in 1985 if the economic forces \ngenerating today's growth and change \ncontinue without the intervention of new \npublic policies. This immense research \nundertaking is called the New York \nMetropolitan Region Study. It was \nsponsored by the Regional Plan \nAssociation, financed by grants from both \nthe Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Ford \nFoundation, and carried out by the Harvard \nGraduate School of Public Administration. A \nNew York staff performed the research \nunder the direction of Dr. Raymond Vernon. \n \nWhat emerges from the findings of the study \nis a vision of a New York metropolis that in \n1985 will be different in many significant \nrespects from that of today. The picture is of \na metropolitan area immensely larger both in \nnumber of people and in geographical \ndevelopment. It is a picture of decay of a \nserious nature for parts of the region in the \nmidst of a picture of plenty for the region as \na whole—decay that will involve whole \ncommunities of people. It is a picture of an \nurban society significantly different in many \nrespects from that which we have known in \nrecent years. It is a picture in which a \nrevolution in transportation will be \nsubstantially completed in twenty-five years. \nFinally, it is a picture in which the small \ntown, that traditional hallmark of America, \nwill virtually disappear from our metropolitan \narea. \n \nThis three-year study has shown in detail \nthat within the next twenty-five years the \nNew York metropolitan area will grow from \nits present 16 million people to at least 23.5 \nmillion people. To put this into perspective, \nwe will add to our present population an \n", 'entirely new metropolitan population \nequivalent in size to that of Chicago\'s \npresent metropolitan population. \n \nThis is a scale of growth that the New York \nmetropolis has never before experienced. It \nis its own home-grown version of the \npopulation explosion that is gaining worldwide\nattention. \n \nBut New York\'s growth will be not only in \nterms of people, for it will stretch over an \nimmensely larger area than it now \nencompasses. We can foresee the virtual \nfilling up by 1985 of the entire twenty-twocounty\narea which constitutes the New York \nmetropolitan region. Thus an almost solid \nblanket of land development will stretch \noutward from Manhattan for more than sixty \nmiles in every direction. \n \nFrom an economic viewpoint, one of the \nmost interesting conclusions from the recent \nstudy is that during the coming two and a \nhalf decades a very significant economic \ndecline will continue in certain portions of \nthe metropolitan area, while economic \ngrowth of almost boom proportions will \ncontinue in the rest of the region. Let us \ndivide metropolitan New York into four basic \nsectors, using concentric circles and starting \nwith the central business area in the lower \nhalf of Manhattan. The ring immediately \noutside this is the older city portion of the \nregion, the "core." We can divide the \nsuburban counties into an inner and an \nouter ring. Now let us explore current and \nfuture trends in these sectors. \nTRENDS IN THE HUB \n \nWithin the central business area, which we \nmight call the "hub," the pattern will be one \nof strong economic growth. At the same time \nthere will be significant changes in the \nfunctions of the hub relative to the rest of the \nmetropolis. In the future the hub will \nspecialize increasingly in those functions \nthat require face-to-face contacts among \npeople and in which the interchange of ideas \nis the prime service. The hub will also \nincreasingly specialize in the making and \ndistribution of only those goods and services \nthat are of the highest quality or are most \nunusual. \n \nMore and more the area will be one in which \noffice activities of all sorts take place. The \nvery rapid growth of new office buildings in \nManhattan is a clear demonstration of the \nrising importance of the hub as an office \ncenter. \n \nBut reversing past trends, Manhattan will \ndecline as a manufacturing area. Until very \nrecently, as much as one third of all the \nmanufacturing jobs in the New York \nmetropolitan area have been located in the \nportion of Manhattan below Sixtieth Street. \nBut in the coming twenty-five years there will \nbe a continuing decline in the absolute \nnumber of manufacturing jobs in this area. \nPerhaps the most dramatic example of this \ndecline will be seen in New York\'s famous \napparel industries, concentrated between \nThirty-fourth Street and Fortieth Street on \nManhattan\'s West Side. Perhaps as many \nas 20,000 apparel jobs will move out of the \nhub to other portions of the region or to \nareas outside the region during the twentyfive-year\nspan. A good insight into the forces \nbringing about this shift is provided by the \nMetropolitan Region Study. \n \nFor example, we know that this 16-millionperson\nregion exerts its strongest attractions \non those segments or slices of industries \nthat need and depend on specialized \nservices and skills. The region\'s weakest \npull is exerted on the slices of industries that \nproduce standardized products. \n \nThe needs for special skills are of many \nvarieties. Consider, for example, the need of \nthe high-fashion slice of the apparel industry \nto be in close contact with the best \ndesigners and stylists, and the need of the \nwriting and publishing slice of the printing \nand publishing industry to be close to a \nmajor news-making and idea-producing \ncenter such as New York City and also to \nsuch an incomparable supply of writers and \nresearch facilities as that in the hub\'s great \nuniversities. Close contact, the opportunity \nfor day-to-day meetings, the chance to \ndepend on the skills and facilities of other \nspecialists—these are ingredients that exert \na strong attraction on certain slices of \nindustries. \n \n', 'But the slices that are not attracted— those \nthat in many instances indeed tend to move \nout of the center of the region and out of the \nregion itself—are the producers of \nstandardized products, especially \nmoderately priced standardized products. \nThese are pulled away from the region by \nthe supplies of unskilled labor and the \ngenerally lower wage structures in the \nnation\'s smaller cities, its rural areas and \nsome of its other metropolitan areas. \n \nImprovements in transportation and \ntechnology are catalysts that help the \nsegments or slices of industries that produce \nstandardized products to move out of the \nregion. Studies document again and again \nthat as an industry grows and matures, it \ndevelops more and more machinery that \nreplaces hand skills with machine skills. This \nimprovement in technology is one of the \ncatalysts that permit the industry to use \nunskilled and thus cheaper labor in its \nmanufacturing processes. The tendency of \nthe apparel industry to produce more and \nmore standard-style cheaper garments and \nthe subsequent moves of one slice of the \ngarment industry from the New York region \nis a prime example of this process. \n \nImprovements in transportation—especially, \nin recent years, the development of truck \ntransport and the burgeoning network of \nhigh-speed limited-access highways—are \nthe second catalysts in bringing about \ngreater flexibility of locational choice, freeing \nmany segments of industries from the need \nto remain close to the metropolitan centers. \n \nThe hub is changing as a retail center as \nwell. It no longer serves, as it did in past \ndecades, as the prime and virtually the only \nbig shopping center for the entire region; for \nthe growth of outlying shopping centers is \nabsorbing much of this general distribution \nfunction. Particularly are the suburban \nstores taking on the job of retailing \nstandardized products. Thus the function to \nbe served by the remaining retail stores in \nthe hub will be the sale of goods that are the \nhighest in fashion, the most unusual, the \nmost expensive, and so forth. \nTHE HUB AS A LIVING AREA \n \nAs a living area the hub and its immediate \nfringes also appear destined for a strong \neconomic future. However, its residents are \nlikely to be primarily the well-to-do and other \nspecial segments of the population, and not \na melting pot of poor, middle class, and rich, \nas in the past. For example, it is likely to be \npopulated to a greater extent by older and \nretired couples whose suburb-reared \nchildren have married and moved from \nhome. It will also be populated by young \nmarried couples without children, unmarried \nadults, and others drawn to the excitement \nof the hub. It is not at all likely to be \ncharacterized by large numbers of children. \nTHE CORE \n \nIn the core, outside the hub, the pattern that \nemerges for the next twenty-five years is \none of spreading deterioration and decline. \nThis is the area of the older city that is now \ndeteriorating rapidly. It is the area in which \nthe region\'s incoming Negroes, Puerto \nRicans and other migrant groups are now \nsettling. It is the area of oldest housing, \nolder schools, and older shopping and other \ncommunity facilities. It is the area (in \ncomparison with the suburbs) that is of the \npast, of the nineteenth century and not of \nthe twentieth century. \n \nThis is the belt of slums and "gray areas." \nWhat is happening here is not only a \nbreakdown of the physical structure but also \na parallel breakdown of the intangible but \nvital community structures. And this perhaps \nis the greatest danger facing the gray areas. \nFor if those subtle fabrics of relationships \nthat tie and bind the thousands of families in \nthese areas together into creative social \nforces are destroyed, then the human \nenergies that might be harnessed to enrich \nand rebuild are dissipated and lost. \n \nLoss of community structure occurs in the \nalmost incredibly rapid turnover of \npopulation in many portions of the gray \nareas as former middle-income families \nmove out to the suburbs to be replaced by \nnewcomers to city life. Perhaps the most \nstartling example of how rapid this turnover \ncan be was discovered in research \nconducted by the City of New York on a \nproposed urban renewal area. It was found \n', "that a 70 per cent turnover of residents had \noccurred in a heavily populated twenty-block \narea in Manhattan in a period of no more \nthan seven years. \n \nThus it can be said truthfully that in \nincreasing portions of the gray areas whole \ncommunities of families are gradually \nabandoning their former neighborhoods to \nscatter over wide areas of the metropolis in \nsearch of better housing and better \nneighborhoods. And as the community \nleaves, the factor that is weakened and in \nsome instances irretrievably lost is the \nintangible community structure that could \nonly have a meaning and reality while the \nmajority of the families which had \nexperienced and built it remained in the \narea. It is lost either because not enough old \nfamilies remain to pass it on to the \nnewcomers or because the newcomers \nrequire a different kind of community social \nstructure. \n \nThe results of this lost community structure \nin the gray areas are the feelings of \nfrustration, futility, and ultimately of rebellion \nwhich are being documented each day in \nthe metropolitan newspaper stories of \njuvenile and other delinquencies. \n \nFinally, the economic picture that is painted \nfor the gray areas is not a particularly \nhopeful one for the future. For when the \neconomic forces operating in the \nmetropolitan area are analyzed, the \nconclusion is that this area will not redevelop \nitself and will not experience a rebirth by \nitself in the coming twenty-five years. Its \nfuture, short of a massive intervention of \npublic funds and aids far greater than those \nof present urban redevelopment programs, \nis one of continuing decline and \ndeterioration. \nTHE INNER RING OF SUBURBAN \nCOUNTIES \n \nFor the inner ring of suburban counties, the \nover-all picture is one of continuing rapid \npopulation and economic growth. This is the \narea of suburbs that had its initial growth \nduring the 1920's and 1930’s. In the coming \ndecade and a half, the remaining vacant \nareas in the inner ring counties will be \ncompletely blanketed with new population \nand land development. In general the \npattern of new development will follow the \ntypical suburban pattern we have seen in \nrecent years—generally moderate-to-lowdensity\nsingle-family housing, new shopping \ncenters, new industrial establishment, and \nso forth. But here and there the inner-ring \ntowns will feel increasing pressures for new \napartment developments, as population \npressures build up. The future picture of the \ninner-ring counties is not entirely a rosy one, \nfor even within this area of suburbs some \nareas will experience deterioration. Older \ncenters such as Paterson, Bridgeport, \nNorwalk, and Elizabeth will reflect in \nmicrocosm the situation for the region as a \nwhole: the core areas of these smaller cities \nwill deteriorate and a belt of slums will \ncontinue to grow around their own \ndowntown hub areas. This too will be a belt \nof slums that will not be able to redevelop \nitself. It is also likely that increasing numbers \nof residents of New York City's slums will \npush into the deteriorated portions of \ncommunities such as Elizabeth and \nPaterson, seeking the somewhat better and \nlower-density slums of the outlying smaller \ncities. \nTHE OUTER RING OF SUBURBS \n \nWhen we look, finally, at the outer ring of \nsuburban counties, we find that this will be \nthe area in which the region's most rapid \ngrowth will take place in the next twenty-five \nyears. New blankets of residential \ndevelopments spotted with new industrial \nand commercial expansion will be laid down \nin a pattern that reflects, generally, the new \nhigh standards of twentieth century living. \nIncreasingly, whole neighborhoods and \ncommunities will be planned and built as \nintegrated units, minimizing the traffic and \nother frictions that plague the older city \npatterns. The outlying areas will be \ninterlaced with the new highspeed limitedaccess\nhighways affording a standard of \nautomobile and truck transportation that is \nfar higher than that of congested in-city \ntravel. \n \nIt is possible that by 1985 almost all of the \ndevelopable land in the outer ring counties \nwill be filled with new homes and other \n", "installations, thus in one sense completing \nthe development of our twenty-two-county \nregion. \nMEANING OF THE \nMETROPOLITAN REGION STUDY \n \nNow what does the over-all pattern of this \nimmense study add up to? I think a number \nof conclusions can be stated. Unless I miss \nmy guess by a wide margin, all of us will \nfind, if we strive to deepen our \nunderstanding of it, that the picture \npresented is an image of an economy and \nmetropolitan urban society that has arrived \nat the next important stage or level of \nindustrialization. It will become increasingly \nclear that this is a stage that poses the \ngreatest of challenges to our organizational \nand administrative abilities. We must accept \nthis challenge or bear the consequences of \nthe divisive forces that can grow out of such \na highly specialized economy as we find \nourselves in. \n \nWhat is this stage of industrialization? It is a \nstage in which our economic activities and \nthe organization and distribution of these \nactivities are very much more specialized \nthan in the past. We have arrived at this \nstage as our metropolitan region has grown \ngreatly in size and numbers through and \nsince World War II and as our industrial \ntechnology has given us greater and greater \ncontrol over our physical surroundings and \nresources. As one studies the nine volumes \nreporting the findings of the Metropolitan \nRegion Study, one finds them laced with \nillustrations of this increasing specialization. \nIn his description of the changes taking \nplace in the region's central business district \nin Manhattan, Dr. Vernon notes the \nincreasing specialization of this area as the \noffice headquarters of the region and nation \nwhile its function as a retail and \nentertainment center also becomes more \nspecialized. Vernon also reports that the \ncore of the region is losing its middle-income \npopulation and receiving more and more \nlow-income residents to replace them. Put \nanother way, what Dr. Vernon is saying is \nthat the core is specializing in low-income \nresidents and the suburbs outside the major \nsatellite cities are specializing in middle- and \nhigh-income residents. \n \nNow the challenge that this presents is the \nchallenge that specialization has always \npresented. It is a challenge of organization \nand administration: How can all the \nincreasingly specialized divisions of our \nurban metropolitan economy and society be \ncoordinated so as to work efficiently toward \nvery broadly held goals? Vernon has \nsounded some very plain warnings that the \ncurrent organization and administration of \nour economic activities are not sufficient to \nprevent the runaway formation of slums and \nblight in our older cities, for example. \n \nInevitably, then, we will need better media of \ncentral coordination in order to harness and \nreap the benefits that can come from some \naspects of this further tendency toward \nspecialization. \n \nBut one thing is certain: we cannot depend \non our present organization of governments \nand governmental agencies in the region to \nbend the economic forces in a way that will \navoid the worst consequences of some of \nthe patterns described above. That is, we \ncannot depend on existing governmental \norganization if we accept one of the major \nfindings of the study. In a speech at the \nRegional Plan Association Conference held \nin October 1959, Professor Robert Wood of \nM.I.T. said: \n \nOur advice to Dr. Vernon, the RPA, and to \nthe other economists of the Metropolitan \nRegion Study, in respect to the role of local \ngovernment in shaping regional \ndevelopment is this: at the present time and \nunder the present system you may as well \nwrite off government as an effective force. \nPublic action may exaggerate and may \nstimulate some of the economic trends that \nDr. Vernon has discovered to be underway. \nIt is not likely however to either modify or \ncounteract the major tendencies of diffusion \nor decentralization. \n \nDr. Wood then explained the extensive \nanalysis of governmental operations and \nstructure that led him to this conclusion. \nSpeaking in a hopeful vein at the conclusion \nof his remarks, he said: \n \nAs a political scientist, I would like to point \nout that the course of regional development \n", 'does not have to continue as economic \nforces dictate. I have a conviction that public \npolicy can reverse economics on occasion. \nOne can conceive of different governmental \narrangements which will provide a \ncountervailing influence. \n \nIf you want to conceive of new policy and \nnew arrangements, however, I think our \nevidence shows there cannot be patchwork, \nminimal adjustments. The change will have \nto empower some governmental institutions \nto intervene selectively in a mixed economy \nat the local level on a scale larger than we \nhave heretofore conceived. A whole series \nof other adjustments will have to take place \nin the working relations among political \ninstitutions. If these changes do not occur, if \nthe political system as it exists in the region \ntoday continues to behave as it usually \ndoes, then the economic trends will run their \nuninterrupted course. \n \nWhat is the alternative to the Metropolis \n1985 that has been sketched for us by the \nMetropolitan Region Study? The answer is: \nwe have no clear idea yet. However, some \nvague outlines are available to us. These \noutlines are most evident in the far higher \nstandards of living inherent in the physical \npatterns of the new developments in our \nsuburban areas, especially in the newer \nresidential areas in which schools, shopping \nareas, new and handsomely landscaped \nindustrial areas, plus all the other various \nappurtenances of communities, are \ncombined in ways that reduce to a minimum \nthe frictions and irritations of crowded \nnineteenth century urban patterns. These \nnewer developments also suggest that \nbeauty, order, and efficiency can provide a \ntruly inspiring setting for living in the \nmetropolis of the future. \n \nBut while portions of our newer suburban \nareas offer the clearest view of the \nalternative patterns geared to a twentieth \ncentury set of standards, some bits and \npieces are also available here and there in \nthe older cities. I am now speaking of the \nfew outstanding jobs of urban \nredevelopment that are occurring throughout \nthe country. To cite one of the best \nexamples, there is the superb job in hub \narea redevelopment being carried out in \nPittsburgh, where pedestrian plazas, open \nparks, new office buildings, and new cultural \nfacilities are all being combined to provide \nan exciting and inspiring new setting for the \nbusy activities of downtown. \n \nIn the gray areas there are too few \nexamples of redevelopment, but some \nexamples of the kinds of things that can take \nplace are afforded by the Lake Meadows \ndevelopment in Chicago and the Fresh \nMeadows development here in New York. \nHere are whole new communities, built to \nmodern twentieth century standards, which \nsuggest that establishing sound, internally \nstable oases in the midst of the surrounding \ndecay of gray areas may be feasible. \n \nThe new high-standard limited-access \nhighways also offer a glimpse of the future. \nAs they are mapped out and slowly built, \nthey suggest a very high order of ease and \nfreedom of travel in the suburban portions of \nour regions in contrast to slower and more \ncrowded travel in the city. \nTHE CHOICE \n \nThus there are two possibilities for the \nmetropolitan area of the future: one that can \neasily cause us serious trouble, and another \nthat can release us from much of the friction \nand unpleasantness of our present living \nenvironments and thus provide a stage in \nwhich our creative abilities are given \nmaximum freedom for development. \n \nThe necessity for us as an American \ndemocratic society to choose which of these \nfuture metropolitan patterns we wish to have \nis becoming urgent. It is out of this choice \nthat the revolution I spoke of earlier is \nemerging. For the decade of the 1960*5 will \nbe the decade of decision in which the revolt \nagainst the old city and the unwanted \nmetropolis will take place. We will decide \neither by inaction or by action. Whichever it \nis, the choice will be fundamental to the \nfuture of the whole democratic ideal on \nwhich this nation is based. \nREFERENCES \n \nIn addition to the publications of the \nRegional Plan Association and the New \n', 'York Metropolitan Region Study the \nfollowing are suggested reading: \n \nACTION Series in Housing and Community \nDevelopment.
