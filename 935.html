However, finding the combat model parameters satisfying the required\ncombat power using simulation can take a long time for two reasons: (1) the prolonged execution time per simulation run and\n(2) the enormous number of simulation runs. This paper proposes a simulation-based optimization method for the SoS-based\nsimulation model to overcome these problems. The method consists of two processes: (1) the transformation of the SoS-based\nmodel into an integrated model using the neural network to reduce the execution time and (2) the optimization of the\nintegrated model using the genetic algorithm with ranking and selection to decrease the number of simulation runs. The\nexperimental result reveals that the proposed method significantly reduced the time for finding the optimal combat parameters\nwith an acceptable level of accuracy.\n1. Introduction\nIn modern warfare, communication, responsible for the flow\nof information between combat entities, is a primary factor in\nattaining victory. That is, without proper communication,\nthe combat commander cannot obtain detection information\nand forward appropriate attack orders to combat entities.\nSuch a battlefield environment based on communication\nsystems is called network-centric warfare (NCW) [1, 2].\nMany researchers in the defense modeling and simulation\n(DM&S) domain have recognized the importance of NCW\nand have tried to analyze combat systems using war game\nsimulators reflecting the effects of communication. In earlier\nstudies, researchers depicted communication effects by using\na simplified model or by assuming perfect communication in\na combat model from the perspective of a standalone system\n[3, 4]. However, as the importance of communication and\nthe need for a detailed depiction of the network system\nincrease, recent studies have separated the network model\nfrom the combat model [5, 6]. Namely, they have implemented\neach model with dedicated modeling development\ntools and have interconnected the model through an\ninteroperation standard, such as the high-level architecture\n(HLA) or the test and training enabling architecture from\nthe perspective of the system of systems (SoS) [7–10].\nIn the SoS, the system means a set of interrelated\ncomponents working together toward some common\nobjective or purpose, and the SoS means a set of systems\nfor a task that none of the systems can accomplish on its\nown [11, 12]. This SoS-based approach has a merit in\nthat a collection of dedicated systems offers more functionality\nand performance than simply the sum of the constituent\nHindawi\nComplexity\nVolume 2018, Article ID 4521672, 15 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4521672\n', 'systems and the conduct of various analyses by using existing\nmodels developed using the specialized tools in each domain\n[13–15]. For example, the combat model, which was only\nable to analyze the combat power, can measure the combat\npower under the communication environment by combining\nwith a network model, which only can describe the\ncommunication environment.\nThe SoS-based NCW simulation offers the advantage of\nenabling the conduct of the “what-if” analysis of the combat\npower against various combat scenarios with related parameters\nin the combat model, by reflecting detailed communication\neffects from the network model [16, 17]. However, the high\ncomplexity of the network model and the interface connecting\nthe two models paradoxically increase the execution time per\nsimulation trial [18–20]. Porche et al. raised the simulation\noverhead of the highly complex network model and then analyzed\nthe combat system with the metamodel of the network\nmodel [21]. Miner et al. also brought up the prolonged execution\ntime due to the network model when developing the SoS\nanalysis toolset, and they constructed its metamodel [19].\nAlthough some studies have conducted the abstraction of the\nSoS-based NCW simulation model, they have not entirely\nreflected the SoS property due to using data from the simulation\nof the standalone network model, not the SoS.\nFurthermore, because the NCW simulation model is\nusually represented as a discrete-event simulation model with\na stochastic property, a large number of replicated simulations\nare required to obtain a steady state of the combat power [22].\nAs a result, the “what-if” analysis based on the SoS-based\nNCW simulation becomes a time-consuming problem due to\ntwo challenges: (1) enormous total simulation runs due to a\nlarge number of experimental points and replicated simulations\nper point and (2) the long execution time per simulation run.\nWhen a decision-maker wants to find the parameters of\nthe combat model satisfying the requirement operation capability\n(ROC) of the combat power using the SoS-based NCW\nsimulation, a significant computational cost is required.\nOne way to reduce the enormous simulation runs is\nto apply the optimization method for the discrete-event\nstochastic simulation model [17, 23, 24]. However, this\nprocess also requires the considerable time because it takes\na long time per run of the SoS-based simulation model. On\nthe other hand, another approach to dealing with the long\nexecution time per run is to transform the SoS-based simulation\nmodel into an integrated simulation model via the\nabstraction of the model [25–27]. Although this can reduce\nthe time required to conduct the exploratory analysis, for\nexample, a full search on the design space, the “what-if”\nanalysis is also time-consuming because the integrated simulation\nmodel requires somewhat execution time [28, 29].\nThat is, independently using each approach to the SoSbased\nNCW simulation model has a limitation when it comes\nto solving the two drawbacks simultaneously.\nThis paper applies a simulation-based optimization\nmethod to the SoS-based NCW simulation model in the form\nof a hybrid approach to overcome the abovementioned\nchallenges. It consists of two processes: (1) the transformation\nof the SoS-based NCW simulation model into the\nintegrated simulation model via the model abstraction using\nthe neural network [30, 31] and (2) the simulation-based\noptimization using the genetic algorithm (GA) with ranking\nand selection (R&S) [32, 33]. The former plays a role in\nreducing the execution time for the NCW simulation with\nan acceptable error; the latter plays a role in reducing the\nnumber of simulation runs required for finding the\nparameters of the combat model satisfying the given combat\npower in the entire design space. By integrating the\nmerits of the two approaches, this paper finally facilitates\nsimulation-based optimization in the SoS environment.\nIn our case study, we measured the accuracy and\nefficiency of the proposed optimization method for the SoSbased\nNCW simulation, which has already been validated.\nConsequently, the experimental results show that the first\nprocess reduced the execution time 113.31 times within the\n5.6248% error range and the second process decreased the\ntotal number of simulation runs 19.76 times for obtaining\nthe optimal solution with 95% accuracy. Considering the\nsynergy effect, the proposed method ultimately reduced\nthe execution time 2239 times within acceptable accuracy.\nFinally, our study provides an alternative method for finding\nthe optimized parameters satisfying the given performance\nrequirements in the enormous design space in the SoS.\nThis study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes\nthe background and related work. Section 3 explains the\nproposed method. Section 4 discusses the experimental\nresults from the NCW simulation. Finally, Section 5 concludes\nthis study.\n2. Background\n2.1. System-of-Systems Stochastic Simulation Model for NCW.\nThe NCW system consists of combat entities that are\ngeographically or hierarchically dispersed and that share\ninformation through communication [34]. To describe the\nNCW system as depicted in Figure 1, modelers have\ndeveloped a combat model for the military operation and a\nnetwork model for communication effects separately from\nthe perspective of the SoS, and they have enabled the information\nbetween two heterogeneous models to be shared\nthrough the interoperation middleware.\nIn this structure, the network model reflects the communication\neffects on information delivery among entities of the\ncombat model, which acquires the communication effects,\nfor example, the packet delivery ratio (PDR) or end-to-end\ndelay. The former refers to the ratio of the number of successfully\ndelivered packets from the source to the destination\nnode; the latter refers to the average time the packets take\nto arrive at the destination from the source node [35]. By\nreflecting these effects, the combat model simulates the\ncombat power.\n2.2. Optimization in the Stochastic Simulation Model. The\nconcept of optimization in the stochastic simulation models\ncan simply be depicted in Figure 2. Since the model cannot\nbe expressed in an analytic closed form, conducting the\noptimization using the inverse model is impossible. Thereby,\nconducting repeated simulations for solving the optimization\nproblem is inevitable [36]. To be specific, if we find an\n2 Complexity\n', 'optimized parameter setting that maximizes the model’s\nperformance among k design alternatives (where design xi\nrefers to a particular setting of the model parameters), the\ntotal k × h simulation runs are required when considering\nh replications per design. To overcome the stochastic noise\nand to find the optimal design accurately, increasing h and\nobtaining the accurate performance of each design (i.e., μi)\nare necessary. However, increasing h causes efficiency\nproblems in the optimization due to the increased cost\nof repeating the simulation as previously mentioned. The\ngreater the number of design alternatives k, the worse this\nproblem becomes.\nMany methods for solving the efficiency problem have\nbeen proposed. These methods can be classified into two\ncategories according to the number of alternatives [37]. If k\nis infinite or very large, classical metaheuristic search\nmethods, such as simulated annealing [38], GA [39], and\ntabu search [40], can be considered efficient approaches.\nThese methods reduce the required number of simulation\nruns by performing the simulations only for selected alternatives\nrather than for all alternatives as depicted in Figure 3(a).\nTo accurately find optimal designs using these methods,\nselecting alternatives for the simulation, including such\noptimal designs, is important.\nOn the other hand, if k is finite and relatively small\n(specifically, all alternatives can be simulated more than five\ntimes), the ranking and selection (R&S) methods in statistics,\nsuch as OCBA [41], KN [42], and UE [43], can be considered\nStochastic\nsimulation model\n(f(·))\nStochastic\nsimulation model\n(f(·))\nStochastic\nsimulation model\n(f(·))\nStochastic\nsimulation model\n(f(·))\nInverse stochastic\nsimulation model\n(f−1(·))\nImpossible\nPossible\n⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\nx y x y\nx1\nx2\nxk\n𝜇1\n𝜇2\n𝜇k\nk\n d\nes\nig\nn \nal\nte\nrn\nat\niv\nes\n, Θ\ny11 y12 y1h\ny21 y22 y2h\nyk1 yk2 ykh\nReplications\nk × h simulation runs\nS = argmax 𝜇i\nxi ∈ Θ\n𝜇i yij=\nh\nh j = 1\n1\nFigure 2: Optimization in the stochastic simulation model.\nM&S\nin SoS view\nMilitary operation\nOutput:\nCombat\npower\nInput:\nCombat system\nparameter\nSoS stochastic simulation modelfor NCW\nInteroperation\nCombat model\nNode\nNetwork model\nEntity\nNetwork-centric warfare (NCW)\nCommunication effect\nFigure 1: SoS-based NCW simulation model with a stochastic property [27].\n3Complexity\n', 'efficient approaches. Unlike classical metaheuristic methods,\nstatistical R&S performs simulations for all alternatives. It\nreduces the total number of simulation runs by appropriately\nadjusting h in each design as indicated in Figure 3(b).\nThat is, the aim of R&S is to select the optimal designs\naccurately by allocating the limited number of simulation\nruns effectively. Because the R&S performs the simulations\nfor all designs, it is less likely to fall into a local optimization\ncompared with metaheuristic methods that perform\nthe simulations only for the selected alternatives, and it\nensures that the discovered optimal design is the global\noptimum. However, it is clear that the R&S cannot be\napplied to the case of a large number of alternatives because\nthe simulation should be performed for all alternatives at\nleast more than five times.\n3. Proposed Method\nAs illustrated in Figure 4, the objective of this study is to find\nthe optimized input parameters of the combat model, which\nsatisfy the given ROC corresponding to the combat model’s\noutputs (i.e., the combat power in the SoS-based simulation\nmodel). To find the parameters as efficiently as possible, this\npaper is aimed at minimizing the simulation cost and time\ndue to a large number of simulation runs while retaining\nthe accuracy.

For this, this paper abstracts the network\nmodel to the abstracted model. Owing to the simplified\nnetwork model and the removal of the interoperation middleware,\nthis process surely shortens the execution time\nper simulation run.\nIn the optimization process subsequently, an optimization\nalgorithm specialized in the stochastic simulation model\nminimizes the number of simulation runs required for\nfinding the optimized input in the entire design space (lower\npart). As a result of the two processes, the proposed method\ncan reduce the total time for finding the parameters satisfying\nthe required combat power. The following sections explain\neach process in detail.\n3.1. Transformation Process. Figure 6 depicts the transformation\nprocess consisting of two phases: (1) data acquisition\nfrom the simulation of the SoS-based NCW stochastic model\n(right upper part) and (2) the abstracted network model\nconstruction using the neural network (right lower part).\nAs mentioned in the prior section, the original network\nmodel plays a role in calculating the communication effects.\nLikewise, the abstracted model should be able to calculate\nthe same effects. In addition, because the original network\nmodel is the discrete-event model, the abstracted network\nmodel should also be a discrete-event model that can\nparticipate in the discrete-event simulation.\nFor the abstraction, data exchanged between the two\nmodels in the original SoS simulation should be collected\nand analyzed. From the C response message, the PDR and\nend-to-end delay can be approximated. The C request\nmessages are used for calculating the interdeparture time\n(intDepT) of the messages. This paper uses the interdeparture\ntime for the identification of the original network\nmodel [44, 45]. From the raw data, we can construct\neach data input and output set, {intDepT, PDR} and\n{intDepT, DELAY}, for training the neural network of\ntwo communication effects.\nAfter the data acquisition, the second phase involves\nconstructing the abstracted network model through the\nmodel hypothesis in phase 2.1 and the variable estimation\nin phase 2.2. In the model hypothesis phase, a discreteevent\nsystem specification (DEVS) atomic model is con-\nstructed and will participate in the discrete-event simulation\nwith the combat model. To estimate the PDR and end-to-end\ndelay in the variable estimation phase, the input and output\nsets are trained in the nonlinear autoregressive exogenous\n(NARX) neural network, which is suitable for representing\nthe dynamic and nonlinear properties of the network model\n[46]. Finally, this paper constructs the integrated stochastic\nmodel (left lower part of Figure 6) by substituting the\nnetwork model with the identified and abstracted network\nmodel from the SoS-based NCW stochastic model (left upper\npart of Figure 6).\nCombat model\nas it is\nOutputInput\nSoS model for NCW\nInteroperation\nCombat\nmodel\nNetwork\nmodel\n1) Transformation\nOutputInput Combat\nmodel\nAbstracted\nnetwork model\nOutputInput\nIntegrated model for NCW\nCombat\nmodel\nAbstracted\nnetwork model\n2) Optimization\nAbstract\nnetwork model\nOptimizer\nGiven\nOutput\nFind\nInput\nC request C response\nIntegrated model for NCW\nFigure 5: Overall procedure of the proposed method.\n5Complexity\n', "Figure 7 represents the abstracted network model (ANM)\nbased on the DEVS formalism. We hypothesize that the\nabstracted model, which an atomic DEVS model describes,\nis a probabilistic priority queue, where the DELAY associated\nwith events are considered to be priorities by influencing\nthe PPDR in generating stochastic events in the mixed\ntime [47]. The formal specification of ANM can be found\nin Specification 1.\nThis model has three states: WAIT , q , COMM, q ,\nand SEND, q . The first and second are the states of q\nwithout and with messages received from the combat\nmodel; the third state is the state sending the message\nto the combat model. When receiving a message for\nreflecting the communication effects in WAIT , q from\nδext, this model calculates DELAY and PPDR values using\ncalculateDelay and calculatePDR, which are trained via\nthe NARX model and implemented as the functions. Then,\nthe model stores the message with a scheduled time for\noutput (C response) and PPDR by adding the current time\nand DELAY in q. Then, it updates minTA and transits to\nCOMM, q . After the minTA time, this model conducts\nδpint to SEND, q based on PPDR and generates the message\nto the combat model in SEND, q . Through such a\nmodel structure, this abstracted model can participate in\nthe discrete-event simulation, which is impossible using\nonly the neural network, and generates a different output\naccording to the status of the adjacent model through\nthe neural network.\n3.2. Optimization Process. As mentioned previously, the\noptimization methods for the stochastic simulation model\ncan be classified into the classical metaheuristic and R&S\nmethods depending on the number of design alternatives\nk. To increase the efficiency of the optimization (i.e., to\ndecrease the total number of simulation runs T denoted\nas k × h in Figure 2), the metaheuristic methods reduce\nthe k when k is large. On the other hand, the R&S\nmethod improves the efficiency by decreasing h when k\nis relatively small. Although the applicable case of each\nmethod is different, the efficiency of the optimization\ncan be further increased by reducing k and h simultaneously\nif both methods can be used together.

Since the GA finds the optimal\ndesign by repeatedly updating the population through evaluating\nthe population with stochastic simulation and applying\nthe genetic operations, its performance highly depends on\nthe quality of the population. That is, the more the population\ncontains optimal or similar designs, the more the\nGA can find the solution efficiently with fewer repetitions.\nTo increase the quality of the population, two parent\nchromosomes selected stochastically based on the evaluated\nranking revealed in Figure 8(a) should be the designs with\nhigher performance than the other designs in the population.\nAccordingly, the evaluated ranking needs to be more\naccurate. However, estimating the exact performance of a\nchromosome via a large number of simulation replications\nfor each chromosome (i.e., increasing h) reduces the GA’s\nefficiency by increasing T . As mentioned previously, the\naim of R&S is to find optimal designs accurately by allocating\nlimited simulation replications effectively to k design alternatives.\nSince the size of the population is small enough to apply\nR&S (i.e., k is small), applying R&S to the evaluation stage of\nthe GA can improve the quality of the population via finding\nthe ranking accurately without increasing T as demonstrated\nin Figure 8(b). Consequently, the efficiency of GA can be\nincreased [37, 48, 49].\nAmong various R&S algorithms, we apply the UEmr\nalgorithm which is the most recently developed based on\nthe uncertainty evaluation (UE) framework [43]. Algorithm 1\nrepresents the UEmr algorithm (see [50] for detail). This\nalgorithm focuses on finding good designs of which the\nperformance is within the top-m and identifying their\nrankings accurately. To maximize the accuracy under the\nlimited number of simulation runs, the algorithm allocates\nfurther simulation runs Δ sequentially based on the uncertainty.\nThe uncertainty, the criterion for allocating Δ for each\ndesign, is defined with the p value of the statistical hypothesis\ntest. It indicates the degree to which the observed simulation\nresults of design, such as the sample mean and standard\nerror, can be significant evidence for the correct selection of\nthe design. A small value of the uncertainty close to zero\nmeans that the observed results are significant evidence, so\nthe selection of the design can be statistically considered\ncorrect. On the other hand, a relatively larger value means\nthat the results cannot be the evidence, so it is uncertain\nwhether the selection of the design is correct. Depending on\nthe meaning of the uncertainty, it is necessary to allocate\nmore simulation runs to designs with a relatively higher value\nof the uncertainty, as shown in step 5 of Algorithm 1.\nCompared with the other similar R&S algorithms, such as\nUEm [23], OCBAm+ [48], OCBAm [51], and EOC-m [49],\nthe UEmr can find the top-m designs and their rankings with\nhigher accuracy if the simulation model has a large amount\nof stochastic noise. In the case of complex models, such as\nthe SoS-based NCW model covered in this paper, stochastic\nnoise tends to be great due to its high complexity; thus, the\nUEmr property of high robustness to noise allows the GA\nto perform the optimization of such complex models more\nefficiently. To verify this, we applied the UEmr and the\nsimilar R&S algorithms to the evaluation stage of the GA\nand compared the improved efficiency for the three kinds\nStochastic\nsimulation\nStochastic\nsimulation\nRanking\n& selection\nEvaluation\nEvaluation\nNew population\n(size = k)\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\nkth\n… …\n1st\n2nd\nmth\n…\nEvaluated\nperformance ranking\nof k chromosomes\nSelected m good chromosomes (m < k)\nwith accurate ranking by R&S \nGenetic operations\n(b) Proposed genetic algorithm with ranking and selection (GA + R&S)\n(a) Existing genetic algorithm (GA)\nInitial population\n(size = k)\nLarge design space\nRandom sampling\nMutation\nCross over\n1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\x02e number of\nsimulation \nreplications T\nQuality of population\nNew population\n(size = k)\n…\nChromosome\nRank-based\nselection\nRank-based\nselection\nFigure 8: Procedures of the existing GA and the proposed GA with R&S.\n8 Complexity\n', 'of benchmark models of which the optimal performance\nvalue is zero.

Pc\nand Pm refer to the crossover and mutation probabilities,\nrespectively, used in the genetic operations. Parameter e\nindicates the number of chromosomes for the elitism that\nguarantees that the quality of the population does not\ndegrade as the generation progresses [52]. On the other hand,\namong the parameters for the R&S, T is the total number of\nsimulation runs that can be allocated to the k designs in the\npopulation via Algorithm 1 from each generation. n0 indicates\nthe initial number of simulation runs for the k\ndesigns to obtain the minimum simulation results for\nfurther allocation (as mentioned previously, due to this n0,\nR&S cannot be applied when k is large). Δ means the\nadditional number of replications to be distributed to the k\ndesigns according to the evaluated uncertainties in each\niteration of the loop. Finally, m is the number of the top-m\ndesigns selected by Algorithm 1.\nIn summary, Algorithm 2, which is a combination of the\nGA and R&S, can further increase the efficiency of the optimization\nfor the stochastic simulation model by reducing k\nand h in Figure 2 simultaneously through applying both\nmetaheuristic and R&S methods together. That is, applying\nR&S to the evaluation stage of the GA can improve the quality\nof the population by finding the good chromosomes and\ntheir rankings accurately under limited simulation runs.\nThe experimental results in Section 4.2 demonstrate the\nimproved efficiency of Algorithm 2 in the optimization of\nthe SoS-based NCW stochastic simulation model.\n4. Experimental Results\nThe objective of this section is to demonstrate how much\nthe proposed method reduces the simulation costs while\nretaining accuracy when finding the parameters satisfying\nthe required combat power. Here, the given required combat\npower is to maximize the loss-exchange ratio (LER),\nwhich refers to the ratio of the number of red casualties\nto the number of blue casualties. That is, the optimization\nproblem in this section is finding the optimal parameters\nof NCW [53, 54] that maximize the LER using the SoSbased\nNCW simulation.\nFigure 10 illustrates the scenario of the NCW simulation\nmodel that includes complex and hierarchical information\nexchange among combat entities [55, 56]. When the red force\napproaches, a blue force’s soldier detects it and hierarchically\nsends the detection information to company C2 through\nintelligence fusion (IF). Then, C2 performs threat evaluation\nand weapon assignment (TEWA) and transmits the results to\nindirect weapons for the attack. Afterward, when the red\nforce’s combat power is below a certain level, it instructs\nthe subordinate entities to begin close combat for the direct\nattack. In this situation, the information exchange (blue\narrow) occurs through communication, and thereby, its\nperformance influences the combat power.\nAccording to this scenario, the blue force executes a\ndefense operation against the red force with three times\nthe military strength in a 2 km× 2 km operation area.\nThe combat model represents the army’s military logic at\nan infantry company level including 131 entities, implemented\nin the DEVSimHLA [57, 58]. The network model\ndepicts the mobile ad hoc network (MANET) based on the\ndestination sequenced distance vector (DSDV) routing protocol\nincluding 131 nodes corresponding to the entities,\nimplemented in the ns-3 discrete-event network simulator\n[59–62]. The two models participate in the SoS-based NCW\nsimulation using HLA-RTI, which manages simulation time\nand exchanges the data [63]. The environment for this case\nstudy is as follows. The combat model uses CPU I5-3550\nParameters:\nGA: k, Gmax, e ≤m , Pc, Pm\nR&S (Algorithm 1): T ≤kn0 , n0, Δ ≪T , m ≤k\nINITIALIZATION:\n1: choose k chromosomes randomly as initial population\nLOOP:\n2: for i = 1 to Gmax do\nEVALUATION WITH R&S:\n3: evaluate and find elite m chromosomes from the population with Algorithm 1 (T , n0, Δ, m)\nELITISM:\n4: put the best e chromosomes among the elite m chromosomes into the emptied new population\nGENETIC OPERATIONS:\n5: do\n6: choose 2 parent chromosomes from the elite m chromosomes with the linear ranking selection\n7: generate 2 child chromosomes from the 2 parents with the uniform crossover with Pc rate\n8: mutate the 2 children with the simple bit inversion method with Pm rate\n9: put the 2 children into the new population\n10: while size of the new population ≤k\n11: end for\nFINALIZATION:\n12: return the best chromosome among the population\nAlgorithm 2: Proposed GA with R&S.\n10 Complexity\n', '(3.3GHz), RAM (4GB), and DEVSim++ v.3.1; the network\nmodel uses NS3 v.3.18.

Experimental Design and Results: Transformation. For\nthe first process of the proposed optimization method, we\napplied the transformation process of Section 3.1 to the\nSoS-based NCW simulation to reduce the simulation execution\ntime. To acquire the data for the transformation, we\nconducted the SoS-based NCW simulation. Among the full\nfactorial design spaces, we selected 34 experimental points\nfor training using a Latin hypercube design [60] and conducted\n30 replicated simulations against each point. Accord-\ning to the process in Figure 6, we constructed an abstracted\nnetwork model with the NARX model, which consists of\ntwo input delays, two output delays, and 10 neurons in the\nhidden layer using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.\nAfter the transformation, we chose an extra 17 test points\nat random to compare the experimental results from the\nSoS-based simulation with the integrated simulation with\nthose from the replicated simulation.\nFrom the perspective of accuracy, the absolute rootmean-square\nerror (RMSE) of the LER indicates 0.0742,\nwhich means a relative 5.6248% error when considering the\nminimum and maximum values (0.8287 and 2.149, respectively).\nIn addition, to analyze the speed, we compared\nthe average simulation execution time and the average\nnumber of processed events per trial in the SoS-based and\nintegrated simulation. The SoS-based simulation indicates\n67.083 minutes and 3 0782e + 08 events, respectively, and\nthe integrated simulation indicates 0.592 minutes and\n2 5605e + 06 events, respectively. Assuming that the time\nfor training is negligible, we could reduce the simulation\nexecution time about 113.31 times by abstracting the\nnetwork model with enormous events and removing the\ninteroperation middleware.\n4.2. Experimental Design and Results: Optimization. For the\nsecond process of the proposed optimization method, we\napplied the proposed algorithm (Algorithm 2) to the\nintegrated model, which was developed in the previous process,\nto efficiently find the optimal parameter setting that\nmaximizes the LER by reducing the number of simulation\nruns. A total of 16,384 design alternatives were generated\ndepending on the combat model parameters in Table 1\n(i.e., xi = PCIF, PCTE, PCWA, POC, PPIF, PSIF, PIWT , and each\ndesign was encoded to a chromosome of 14 bits (i.e.,\ntwo bits per parameter in Table 1). The parameters of GA\nin Algorithm 2 were set as follows according to the typical\nDejong setting [64]: k = 50, Gmax = 1000, e = 15, Pc = 0 5,\nand Pm = 0 01. The parameters of R&S were set as follows\naccording to the efficient setting guideline [43]: T = 5000,\nn0 = 10, Δ = 50, and m = 30. As a result, we could find the\noptimal design that maximizes the LER, [20, 20, 20, OC4,\n20, 20, type 4], among 16,384 alternatives very efficiently\nvia applying Algorithm 2. Table 2 and Figure 11 demonstrate\nthe improved efficiency of Algorithm 2 compared\nto the standard GA. Here, the accuracy implies the probability\nof correct selection [37] and was estimated over\n1000 independent trials.\n| | |\nSquad C2\n|\n. . . \nFire request\n· ·\nDetect\nDetection\ninformation\nIndirect\nattack\nDirect\nattack\nNetwork-centric\nbattlefield\nPlatoon C2\nCompany C2\nIndirect weapon\nThreat evaluation\n& weapon assignment Considering\ncommunication effects\nFigure 10: A brief description of the combat scenario of NCW.\n11Complexity\n', 'Algorithm 2 could greatly reduce the total number of\nsimulation runs required to find the optimal design. As\nshown in Table 2, to find the optimal design with 95%\naccuracy, the standard GA required 2,470,000 simulation\nruns (5000× 494 generations), whereas Algorithm 2 used\nonly 125,000 (5000× 25 generations) runs. In the case of\napplying only R&S instead of GA to find the optimal design,\nit is inefficient compared with Algorithm 2 because 163,840\nsimulation runs are required even if just 10 initial replications\nper design are conducted for 16,384 designs. Namely,\nAlgorithm 2, which decreases both k and h by combining\nGA with R&S, can perform the optimization on the integrated\nmodel more efficiently than GA and R&S that only\nreduce k or h.\nAs mentioned previously, the improved efficiency of\nAlgorithm 2 is due to the increased quality of the population\nvia applying R&S that finds the good chromosomes and their\nrankings accurately under limited simulation runs. This\neffect can be more clearly identified by changing the parameter\nsettings of the algorithm, as shown in Figure 11. In\nFigure 11, the setting P1means the previously mentioned setting,\nwhereas P2 and P3 are the settings in which T and e\nwere changed from P1 (i.e., P1 T = 5000, e = 15 , P2 T =\n2500, e = 10 , and P3 T = 1500, e = 5 ). Here, T and e are\nthe parameters that have the greatest effect on the quality\nof the population. In the case of the standard GA, as T\nand e decrease, the quality of the population becomes poor\ndue to the inaccurately evaluated rankings of chromosomes\nand the reduced effects of the elitism; thus, the\nefficiency is reduced greatly, as shown in Figure 11. On\nthe other hand, the efficiency of Algorithm 2 does not\ndecrease significantly because the algorithm finds relatively\naccurate ranking and good chromosomes via R&S. In\naddition, in the case where the stochastic noise is large\ndue to many similar peaks as shown in Figure 12, the high\nrobustness to noise of the applied UEmr further increases\nthe efficiency of Algorithm 2.\n5. Conclusion\nTo solve the time-consuming problem occurring when trying\nto find the combat model parameters satisfying the ROC,\nfor example, combat power, this paper has proposed a\nsimulation-based optimization method for the SoS-based\nNCW stochastic simulation model in the form of a hybrid\napproach with two processes.\nIn the first process, to shorten the prolonged execution\ntime per simulation run, the SoS-based model was transformed\ninto an integrated model by abstracting the highly\nTable 2: The number of simulation runs required to achieve the\nspecific accuracy for the standard GA and Algorithm 2.\nAccuracy Standard GA Algo. 2 (GA+R&S) Ratio\n0.8 1,350,000 85,000 15.88\n0.85 1,565,000 90,000 17.39\n0.9 1,835,000 110,000 16.68\n0.95 2,470,000 125,000 19.76\n0.99 4,000,000 215,000 18.60\n\x02e alternative index\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000\nLo\nss\n ex\nch\nan\nge\nra\ntio\n (L\nER\n)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\nFigure 12: The precise LER for 16,384 designs estimated by 200\nreplications per design using the integrated simulation model.\nGenerations\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\nA\ncc\nur\nac\ny\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nStandard GA - P1\nStandard GA - P2\nStandard GA - P3\nAlgo. 2 (GA + R&S) - P1\nAlgo. 2 (GA + R&S) - P2\nAlgo. 2 (GA + R&S) - P3\nFigure 11: The accuracy curves of Algorithm 2 and the standard\nGA according to the three different settings of the algorithm\nparameters: P1, P2, and P3.\nTable 1: Combat model parameters and their description.\nParameter name Parameter level Description\nCompany C2 intelligence fusion time (PCIF) 20, 40, 60, 80 (sec) The time required for intelligence fusion in company C2\nCompany C2 threat evaluation time (PCTE) 20, 40, 60, 80 (sec) The time required for threat evaluation in company C2\nCompany C2 weapon assignment time (PCWA) 20, 40, 60, 80 (sec) The time required for weapon assignment in company C2\nOperation criteria for close combat (POC) OC 1, 2, 3, 4 The enemy’s required combat power to begin the close combat\nPlatoon C2 intelligence fusion time (PPIF) 20, 40, 60, 80 (sec) The time required for intelligence fusion in platoon C2\nSquad C2 intelligence fusion time (PSIF) 20, 40, 60, 80 (sec) The time required for intelligence fusion in squad C2\nIndirect weapon type (PIWT) Types 1, 2, 3, 4 The types of indirect weapons\n12 Complexity\n', 'complex network model and removing the interoperation\nmiddleware. The transformation based on the neural\nnetwork achieved a small level of error by maintaining the\nnetwork model’s characteristics. In the second process, to\ndecrease the number of simulation runs, the simulationbased\noptimization for the integrated model was conducted\nusing the GA with R&S. The simulation-based optimization\nsignificantly reduced the number of simulation runs for\nfinding the optimized parameters compared with the\noptimization using the GA or R&S alone.\nThe empirical analysis revealed that the first process\nreduced the simulation execution time by 113.31 times\nwithin a 5.6248% error range; the second process decreased\nthe number of simulation runs by 19.76 times to find the\noptimal parameters with 95% accuracy. Taken together, the\nproposed method ultimately reduced the total time by 2239\ntimes with acceptable accuracy. We expect that the proposed\nmethod will help to conduct the simulation-based\noptimization on the SoS-based model in various domains,\nsuch as the military domain.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Brain Korea 21 Plus\nprogram through the National Research Foundation (NRF)\nof Korea funded by the Ministry of Education.
