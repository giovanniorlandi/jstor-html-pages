It Is\nnow the Goldfleld-Salt Lake line, and When reference is made to\nthe road between Goldfield and Ely it is merely the Ely-Gold-field\nbranch. v Which Is not so very important after all.\nIf the road is built from Ely to Goldfield, as there now\nseems to be not the least doubt, Ely will profit to an extent\neven greater than will the cities to the southwest. And should\nthe line be pushed on to Salt Lake, Elj; will profit still more.\nThe mere matter of Incorporating the name of Ely In the\nnew road is of trifling importance when compared with the actual\nconstruction of the road itself. Ely wants the road and wants it\nin operation at the earliest possible moment. Let Goldfield and\nTonopah indulge in argument over the question of location of\nshops, etc., but the only thing that really concerns this end of the\nline is the question of actual construction \' and how long we must\nwait before the primeval stillness of the valleys and highlands in\nthat great stretch of country from Ely southwest to Goldfield is\nbroken by the clang of the locomotive, the war horse of com\nmerce opening to the world an empire that has already waited\ntoo long before contributing its share to the world\'s wealth. Ex\npositor, Ely.\nWhether or not it is to gratify the wish of Ely or not this pa\nper knows not, but it does know that work on the. road will\nstart within the next thirty days in all likelihood. As to Gold\nfield and Tonopah indulging in an argument over the question of\nlocation of shops, etc., it is hardly probable that there will be any\nargument whatever. Neither of the towns will be the headquart\ners for the shops as the road will in all probability miss each of\nthem by many miles. The nearest the road will come to touch\ning the southern gold camp will be Cuprite, where the new road\nwill connect with the Tonopah and Tidewater line.\nThe big advantage Nye county will receive will be in the shape\nof bullion tax which will be turned into the treasury by producing\nmines which will be opened up once theroad is compeltsd. An\nother item of benefit to. Nye county: The road will traverse many\nmiles through the boundaries of old Nye and taxes will have to\nbe paid upon the same by the railroad company. Nye county can\nstand a great many more miles of railroad. At the present time\nthere is not much trackage in. the county from which taxes are\nreceived. Whether or not the shops are built here or at Helli\ngoland matters not; what we want to see is that vast territory\nopened up that old Nevada may Increase its wonderful production\nmany fold.\nAYLESWORTH IS\nTO GIVE TONOPAH\nGOOD SHOWS\nWILL RKMODKIj AND THOR\nOUGHLY REFIT THE OLD\nNEVADA THEATER.\nA. J. Aylesworth, thge theater\nman, came over from Goldfield last\nevening and will return to the\nsouthern camp this morning. The\nobject of Mr. Ayleswortr\'s visit was\nto confer with a contractor concern\ning the remodeling of the Nevada\ntheater in Brougher avenue. Mr.\nAylesworth plans to make of the lo\ncal playhouse one of the best in the\nstates; that is so far as comfort and\nconvenience are concerned. He pro\nposes to bring \' many of the best\ntraveling companies to Tonopah to\nentertain theatergoers.\nIt will be some time before the\ntheater is formally opened.

Mr. Griffin has many kind\nwords to say for the new district\nchief of which is embodied in the\nexpression that everyone there is\nworking. In the daytime, he says,\nthe camp is practically deserted, the\nmen and the women as well de\nveloping the different properties.\nMr. Griffin confirms the report of\nstrikes, mention of which has been\nmade in these columns from time\nto time. He is not endeavoring to\n"Spread it on" in any manner, as\nwill be seen by quoting from his re\nmarks: "The country there is looking ex\nceedingly well, i The leasers are all\nat work with a vim and are open\ning up some good looking veins. In\nnearly every instance those who\nhave secured leases are in ore of a\ngood grade.\n"Our own property possesses a\nvery fair showing, one at least that\nwarrants attention. . At the present\ntime our shaft shows twenty inches\nof ore that will run from $50 to\n$60 per ton in gold. That kind of\nore will pay handsomelv in that\nsection where there is an abundance\nof wood and water.\n"It is an ideal place for a mining\ncamp and should it become a dis\ntrict of large proportions, which\nthere is every reason to believe it\nwill, there will nest among the\npines there one of the prettiest lit\ntle cities in. the state."\nWIXNEMUCCAN INVENTS\n, BURGLAR-PROOF TRUNK\nThe sharp report of what was\nsupposed to be a shotgun startled\nthe residents of West Fourth street\nfrom their slumbers a few nights\nago, and from the noise that fol\nlowed the shot many thought that\nperhaps a murder had been com\nmitted. But after investigation it\nwas found to be nothing more than\nD. I. LaPoint, the local contractor\nand builder, demonstrating his\nburglar-proof trunk. Now, Mr. La\nPoint is of an inventive turn of\nmind and his latest conception Is\nthe burglar-proof trunk. This trunk\nis of the ordinary kind with the\nexception of the lid, wherein the\nsecret of the invention lies. Any\none attempting to open the trunk\nis startled by the loud report of a\ngun. The mechanism is worked by\na trigger and spring and an old pis\ntol placed in a concealed frame in\nthe lid. The contrivance is very\nsimple and can be set by anyone.\nFirst a blank cartridge is placed in\nthe chamber of the gun and then\nthe spring is pushed over to con\nnect with the trigger and the alarm\nis ready. With this attachment on\ntha trunk cannot be opened with\nout setting off the gun. It is a\nwonderful invention and the in\nventor Is planning to get a patent\non it.\nMr. LaPoint has an extensive\nwardrobe and thinking that perhaps\na burglar might enter the house, he\nconceived the Idea of the alarm. Of\ncourse the trunk could be carried\naway and then the alarm would be\nvalueless, but this is overcome by\nnailing the trunk to the floor.\nWinnemucra Humboldt Star.\nA. E.
