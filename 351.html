        <pre>['IDAHO COUNTY FREE PRESS\nOFFICIAL PAPER OF IDAHO COUNTY AND CITY OF GRANGEVILLE.\nVOL. 26, NO. 9\nGRANGEVILLE. IDAHO COUNTY, IDAHO. THURSDAY. JULY\n$2.00 PER YEAR\n27, 1911\nfor\nIn what are known as the Spokane\nReno-Pacific coast rate cases, the in\ntsistate commerce commission on\nMonday ordered a material reduction\nin the freight rates from the east to j\npoints between Denver and the Pacific !\nCoast terminals of the various trans- j\ncontinental railway lines. For many j\n«ears the railroads have been exact- j\ning of shippers located in these inter-.\nmediate points, such as Spokane, Sslt\nic« and others a higher rate on es\neastern freight than was charged the\nterminal cities. The railroads\nhave defended this higher rate by a\ncomparison with the coast rate plus\nthe backhaul. Under the ruling of\ndentate Commerce Commission\nRules Against Railroads.\nEHMNG of SPOKANE RATE CASE\nCheaper Rates for Inland Empire\nBuild Up Small Jobbing Centers.\nFrom St. Paul to Coast\nBackhaul to Spokane...\nTotal\nFrom Chicago to Spokane\nBackhaul to Spokane...\nTotal\nUnder the new rate, from St Paul\nkane on the various classes will be:\nFrom St. Paul to Joseph_\nJoseph to Grangeville.\nTotal\nFrom Chicago to Joseph\nJoseph to Grangeville..\nTotal\ninte within the\n_ î Walla and\nAlready the same rate ap\nplies to Spokane as to coast points in\n®°® e classes, and a cheaper rate in\nothere. The commission recognizes]\nj«»» and suggests that some rates will\n~ higher as a result of the order,\nMaterial reductions will occur to Spo\n* Me *"d like common points in other\nr «pecte, like agricultural implements,\nwhich now pay 1.33 to interior\nPoints and 1.15 to the coast About\nnve per cent reduction accrues to the\ninterior on this class. The railways\n*ro given great discretion in the mat\nter and no arbitrary rates are fixed,\n* substantial compliance with the\nPolicy being all that is required.\nThe unknown quantity in the situ\n«h» is what the coast terminals are\ngoing to do to retain their prestige\n•upremacy as distributors in the\nterritory where they are now placed at\nJ 00 ?® disadvantage by reason of in\ntenor points being able to lay down\ng°od* nearly as cheaply as they can.\n. \' expedients suggest them\nWve ®, none of which may be as ao\n°*ptable as some other after the sit\n"*tion has been worked out, and none\n"h«h may be necessary after the\n"*™c experts and commercial clubs\n; Ve thoroughly analyzed the find\nJ®* »®d how to cope with it For\n000 thing, th« coast in all human\nA comparison of the old Spokane\nrate with the future Grangeville rate,\nwhich in a way is an example of the\nway it will effect other inland towns\nin this territory, shows plainly that\nin the future much of the wholesale\nbusiness of this territory can be done\nwith economy in the middle west as\nthe freight rate in the future will be\nreduced not only to Spokane but the\nlittle towns as well. The decision is\nof material benefit to the Inland\nEmpire but just how much better oft\nthe Spokane wholesale houses will be\nafter the matter is adjusted and in\nworking order is somewhat problemat\nical- In speaking of the decision an\nInland Empire\nmatter in the following intelligent\nway:\nr reviews the\nBriefly, the order discourages the\ncharging of higher rates than a seven\nper cent differential in favor of water\ncompetition on freight destined for\nHpokane than is charged on the same\nfreight destined for coast terminals,\n•id passing through Spokane. Such\nreductions under the seven per cent\npenalty as this brings about apply also\nto interior\ncommon\n•me zone, like\nLewiston.\nî point\nWalla\neral\nthe commission in the future these\nintermediate points are to enjoy the\nsame rate on eastern shipments as the\nCoast points, thus giving them an op\nportunity to be the distributing point\nfor the territory by which they\nsurrounded. The railroads are given\nuntil November 15 in which to adjust\ntheir tariffs accordingly. By the\nruling Lewiston, Walla Walla and\nthe smaller places will be given the\nsame through rate as the larger cities\nlike Spokane, thus giving to them the\nsame advantage as enjoyed by Spo\nkane. Just what the effect of the\nruling will be is hard to conjecture at\nthis time but it looks as though it\nwill have a tendency to make a num\nber of the smaller cities jobbing\nters and much of the territory that\nheretofore has been supplied from the\nlarger cities will be taken care of by\njobbing houses which will eventually\nlocate in the smaller townB and that\nj the trade territory will be more limit\n! ed. Another change that will pos\nj sibly result from the ruling will be\nj that much of the wholesale business\nj heretofore going to the coast will be\ntransferred to the east and middle\nwest and the through rate on all class\nes of freight from St Paul and Chi\ncago in the future will be much less.\nFor instance, under the former\na charges the following rates applied to\nthe various classes of freight from St.\nPaul and Chicago to Spokane:\nare\ncen\nthe\nwas\nwas\nthe\ning\nto\nit\nin\nis\nFirst Class Second Third Fourth\n3.02 2.61 2.19 1.89\n1.87 1.64 1.31 1.11\n4.89\n4.25\n3.50 3.00\n3.52 3.03\n2.52\n1.31\n2.10\n1.87\n1.64\n1.11\nTotal 5.39\n3.83 3.21\n4.64\nand Chicago to Grangeville or Spo\nFirst Class Second Third Fourth\n3.00 2.60 2.20 1.90\n.36\n.31\n.52\n.44\n2,56 2.21\n2.35 2.03\nTotal 3.52\n3.04\n3.21 2.78\n.36\n.31\n.52\n.44\n2.61 2.34\nTotal 3.73\n3.22\nprobability will now turn more and\nmore to the water routes, whereby they\ncan lay in goodB at rates independent\nof government fixing. There is\nequally no doubt that Portland will\nalso turn its attention more to the\nrivers and will develop and use those\nfree highways to a greater extent in\ndistributing to the interior the vast\ncommerce now centering there. The\nshipping agencies, instead of running\naway from the rivers at the slightest\nexcuse, will probably now want to\nkeep them open and in service as long\nand as much as possible. It will\nneed to do so now not as a matter\nof sentiment or as an object lesson,\nbut as a matter of capital utility and\nimportance.\nFor another thing, in view of the\nalmost inevitable recourse of coast\npoints to the water routes, the rail\nways are going to have to do some\nthing to counteract that tendency\naway from their own routes. This may\nbe done, conceivably, by moving\nfreight otherwise thau through Spo\nkane, insofar as such can be done,\nstill without traversing the long and\nthe short principle as already established.\nFor example, the Union Pacific may\nap- route shipments across the continent\nin to Portland, or the Canadian Pacific\nin to Seattle, or what-not, leaving\nSpokane far to one side, and at rates\nwill that will still leave the coast the dis\ntributor as before. In any event, the\nSpo- coast will be given new local rates\ninto the interior territory, and this\nwill apply simultaneously with any\nother changes under the new rule. In\nother respects, intermediate shipping\nthe territory, like 8t Paul, Grand Rapids,\nDetroit, etc., are now given distinct\nmat- rates to the coast, where heretofore\nthey have operated under a blanket\nthe rate, applying equally to all eastern\nterritory on account of the water haul\nsitu- from Atlantic points to the Pacific.\nare The trans-Mississippi territory as a\nwhole seems to be given preferential\nthe distance rates, instead of taking the\nat arbitrary eastern rate under the old\nin- rule. The reductions thus seem to\ndown mean lower rates all around to the\ncan. Pacific coast and not prejudicial rates\nin favor of any locality or at the ex\nao- pense of any locality. That much\nsit- may be taken as certain, regardless\nnone any pretension and clamors that may\nthe be put forth, as has been done in the\nclubs past, to mislead and defraud unm\nfind- formed persons as to special *«van\nFor tages accruing to any point under the\ncommerce commission s powers.\nas\nbe\nis\noft\nbe\nin\nan\nfor\nof\nIE OK LONG RIDE\nMother and Babe Pass Away on\nJourney to Mountains.\nAUGHTER OF 1.

The remains of mother and\nbaby were shipped to Hillyard this\nmorning.\nThe father of Mrs. Bergen, Joe Cov\nerley, was divorced several years ago\nfrom her mother, who is Mrs. Maud\nShimrock of Hillyard. Mrs. Bergen\nwrote twice to her folks at Hillyard,\ntelling them that she was ill and urg\ning them to come to her in Idaho\ncounty.\nWhen it was seen that her condition\nwas critical it was decided to take her\nto Hillyard and her father and hus\nband drove with her and her first-born\nchild of 17 months to Elk City, where\nit was decided she could Btand the\ntrip, 52 miles, to Stites. The start\nwas made Sunday morning. About\none-fourth of a mile before reaching\nthe stage station at Newsome the birth\noccurred and the mother died about one\nhour after.\nIn the meanwhile telephone mes\nsages were sent to Hillyard. Mrs.\nShimrock, accompanied by another\ndaughter, Mrs. Grace McCoombe, and\nlittle daughter of the latter, being\nadvised by a man "who knew the\ncountry," that Stites was only 60\nmiles from Spokane, left Spokane\nSaturday night in an automobile,\nbelieving that by this means they\ncould reach that place in time to see\nMrs. Bergen alive. Stites is 200\nmiles from Spokane and when the\nautomobile broke down at Rosalia,\nWash., they were compelled to await\nthe coming of the train the next day\nbefore resuming their journey.\nThe Hillyard party reached Stites\nat 6 o\'clock Sunday evening and im\nmediately after dinner left by wagon\nin the direction of Newsome and Elk\nCity. They met Mr. Coverley and\nMr. Bergen bringing out the dead\nbodies at the switchback, where there\nis a stage station, and the united\n]>arties drove into Stites together\nMonday morning.\nas\nas\na\nto\nthe\nthe\nExamining County Officers.\nInsurance Commissioner I.

"With a truly Rritlsb\nexactitude," he said, "she requested\nme to fix the sum which my daughter\nmight spend for charity. And now\naha teaches her pupil to mend the\nragged clothes of the poor."\n"And you consider that a good\nthing?" asked Tolstoy.\n"Certainly." replied the other. "It\nbrings the benefactor Into direct con\ntact with the persons whom he is\nhelping."\n"On my part, I think that a well\ndreaaed child who handles dirty and\n111 smelling rags Is playing a hypo\ncritical and theatrical farce."\n"I must ask you not to speak in\nthis way," exclaimed Turgeneff, with\nmenacing looks.\n"Why should I not say what I am\nconvinced is the truth?\'\' remnrked\nTolstoy.\n."You think, then, that I am educat\ning my daughter badly," nnd, while\nFet was Interceding, "If you will talk\nIn tbnt way I shall box your enrs."\nThen he left the room, begging his\nhosts to pardon his abrupt departure.\nTolstoy also went. At the neighbor\nlüg station he wrote to Turgeneff <le\nmandlng an apology. He ordered pi»\ntols and tried to provoke his rlvul to a\nduel. Turgcneff\'s answer, very dlgnl\nfled, brought the apology demanded\nby Tolstoy. He clospd by saying that\nhe thought tt best that two men with\nauch opposite tempers should hence\nforth break off nil relations. Tolstoy,\ncarried away by his anger (It was In\n1861), declined to be satisfied with\nauch an answer. He felt that he had\nbeeu gravely offended. He demnurted\nreparation by arms. He therefore re\npeated hla provocations. His friend\nFet, who attempted to pacify him.\nsucceeded only In drawing from hint\nthis vigorous reply: "1 beg of you\nhenceforth not to write to me auj\nmore. I shall return your letters un\nopened, the same ns i do with Turge\nnelPs." After these occurrences Turge\nneff returned to France, where he\npassed the greater part of his time\nSome months later, on reflection. Tol\nstoy regretted his violence. Seized\nwith remorse, he sent Turgeneff a let\n1 find tt ex\nhe wrote, "to\nter asking his pardon,\nceedingly painful,\nthink that I have made an enemy of\nyou."\nTurgeneff forgave, as one may ini\nagine, but the complete and definitive\nreconciliation took place much later.\nOLD ENGLISH HOUSES.\nIn th* Days of Wooden Huts, Thatched\nRoofs and Clay Floors.\nTbe habitations of English common\npeople for centuries consisted of n\nwooden hut of one room, with the fire\nbuilt in the center. To this hut. if a\nman increased in family and wealth, u j\nlean-to was added and Inter another\nand another. The roofs were of thatch,\nthe beds of loose straw or straw beds\nwith bolsters of the same laid ou tbe\nfloor or perhaps eventually shut in by\na shelf and ledge like tbe berths of n\nship or by a small closet.\nThe Saxon thane or knight built\na more pretentious "hall," n large open\nroom like the Roman atrium with n\nlofty root thatched or covered with\nalates or wooden shingles, in the cen\nter of the hard clay floor burned great\nArea of dry wood whose thin acrid\n■moke escaped from openings in the\nroof, above the hearth or by tbe doors,\nwindows and openings under tbe eaves\nof the thatch.\nBy day the "hearthsmeu" and vis\nitors when not working or fighting sat\non long benches on either side of the\nAre and, as John Hay puts it, "calmly\ndrinked and Jawed" or, gathering at\nlong boards placed on trestles, regal\ned themselves on some sort of porridge\nwith fish and milk or meat nnd ale.\nAt night straw or rushes spread on\nthe floor formed beds for the entire\ncompany in the earlier and ruder dnys,\nwhen the "baser sort" were glad to\nshare their straw with the cows -\nCharles Winslow Hal) in National\nMsgaxlne.\nTh* Cabal.\nTh* term "cabal" as applied to se j\ncrat factions of any kind had its rise\nIn England about 1667, being first ap\npltod to the cabinet of Charles II. and\nformed from the Initials of the cabl\nnet members names—Lord Clifford,\nLord Ashley, the Duke of Bucking\nhnm. Lord Arlington and the Duke\nof Lauderdale C, A. B, A. L.

But this\ntest is not true sport. The birds sim\nply hurl themselves against time and\nspace till they are played out. They\ncan never race again.\nThe rucer rises into the air with\nheavy, slow wing pulsations; then,\nonce poised over the starting point,\nthere is a swifter, shorter beat, and\ntbe time is "bit up" to the third and\npermanent wing rhythm, rapid and\nsteady ns a pulse heat, -which carries\nit home.\nRacers fly 300 feet high over land, but\nlow over water. Their enemies as they\nfly are wind, rain, gunners and hawks.\nThey do all their flying between sun\nrise and sunset. If caught out over\nnight they fend for themselves till\ndawn.\nTbe botniug instinct Is lifelong. Dur\ning tbe Frnnco-Prussinu war the tier\nmans caught a homing pigeon which\nwas on Its way into belenguered Paris.\nThe bird v as kept prisoner for ten\nyears. It was then released. It Imme\ndiately returned to Its old home.\n!\nDISCOVERED BY ACCIDENT.\nHow tho Paving Valu* of Asphalt Waa\nBrought to Notice.\nAll forms of bituminous pavements,\nwhether manufactured from natural or\nartificial asphalt, ure lu fact artificial\natone pnvetneuts. The industry started\nwith the use of the natural rock as\nphalt from tbe mines in the Val de\nTravers, Canton Neufchatel, Switzer\nland. The mines were discovered in\n1721. but it was in 1849 that its utility\nas a road covering was first noticed.\nThe rock was then being mixed for the\npurpose of extracting the bitumen con\ntained In It for use In medicine and !\narts. It Is a limestone found impreg\nnated with bitumen, of which It yields\non analysis from 8 to 14 per cent.\nIt was observed that pieces of rock\nwhich fell from the wagon w ere crush\ned by the weight of wheels, and under\nthe combined influence of the traffic\nand beat of the sun a good road sur\nface was produced. A macadam road\nof asphalt rock was then made which\ngave very good results, and finally iu\n1854 a portion of the Rue Bergere was\nlaid in Paris of compressed asphalt on\na concrete foundation, in 1858 a still\nlarger sample was laid, and from that\ntime it has beeu laid year by year in\nTarts. From Paris it extended to Lon\ndon, being laid on Threadneedle street\nin I860 and Cbeapside in 1870 and in\nsuccessive yeurs on other streets, and\nthen its use in street and road making\nexteuded to other countries. — Ex\nchange.\nn\na\nu j\nn\nn\n-\nFollowed the Book.\n"Die.

Kellogg the\nRepublican trust-buster, by the government, between 1907 and 1911. It »\nbelieved that Kellogg received as much, if not more from the trusts. It was\ndeveloped before the Stanley committee that in one instance he received fees\nfrom the steel trust while being paid by the government to prosecute its friend\nand ally, the oil trust J. B. McReynolds, another "trust-buster" received\n$64,000 from the public treasury for his services in the tobacco and coal\ncarrying railroad cases. In all the Republicans spent more than $3,000,000\nin ten years for "trust busting" and the trusts are still with us.\nAN "IMPARTIAL" INVESTIGATOR.\n99\nG. W. Burton, special agent of the tariff board who is now traveling in\nEurope gathering "exact timformation\' 1 to be used as the basis of tariff revi\nsion by the Republicans, is an Aldrich standpatter on the tariff question.\nBurton on the side, haa been writing letters back for publication in the Los\nAngeles Times, a high protectionist paper. This "impartial" investigator,\ngathering "exact information," in a recent letter declared that: "Your tariff\nrevision demand, fellow Americans, is a fad." In another letter, excoriating\nthe whole tariff revision suggestion, this "impartial" investigator made this\njudicial and carefully weighed observation: "The merchants of our country\nwho are so inadvisedly shouting for lower duties in order to get the cost of\nliving reduced, should stop making so much noise until they learn what they\nare talking about. AU of which is interesting in view of the fact President\nTaft insists Congress should not touch the iniquitous Payne-Aldrich rates un\ntil this "impartial" investigator, G. W. Burton, has told what it ought to do.\nCHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST.\nFor many years the government paid a handsome rental for the use of\nthe Union building in Washington. It developes now that one of the prin\ncipal owners of the building is a daughter-in-law of Senator Hale, and that\nSenator Hale has inserted in the Senate appropriation bill an item which com\npelled the government to lease the building. Senator Hale also caused\nmillioua of dollars of the public money to be expended on a naval shore station\noff the coast of Maine, the bulk of which expenditure was sheer waste. The\nprincipal mission this yard performed was to provide a place for Senator\nHale\'s political henchmen. Nor was that all: While Senator Hale\nthe exercise of almost unlimited power in the Senate as chairman of the\npropriations committee, his son, Frederick Hale, secrectly received a fee of\n$5,000 out of the secret service fund for alleged diplomatic labors in helping\nto fix a Canadian boundary line. No one can find out what young Hale\nactually did to earn this $5,000. These and other acts of Mr. Hale while he\nwas senator justify the demand that he be given a chance to explain,\nhaps he will demand it in justice to himself.
