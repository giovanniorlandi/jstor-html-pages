H. Jen\nnings, District Vice President. \' A\nsplendid representation of delegates\n, and visitors from the district clubs\nfederated and non-federated, was p. e\nserit. After the convention had been\ncalled to order the invocation pro\nnounced by, Mrs. Joseph Sprott, the\nManning Choral \'Club gave two selec\ntions which were well received by tho\nr\'dience. Mrs. S. O. O\'Bryan, presi\ndent of the Manning Civic League,\nthe hostess club, welcomed the guests\nand Mrs. N. G.

Mrs. Moss also announced that\nthe Southeastern Council will meet at\nPinehurst, N. C. on December 5, 6\nand 7 and urged that any club mem\nler who can go notify her. The\nNorth Carolina Council meets there\nat the same time and all club women\nare invited to. attend this meeting, so\nit is .hoped that South Carolina, and\nparticularly the Central District, will\nbe well represented.\nAt thjs juncture Hon. Thos. G. Mc\nLeod, Governor-elect, was ushered in\nto the meeting and was given an ova\ntion. So great was the applause\ngreeting him\' that the president sus\npended the regular order of the pro\ngram and requested Mr.\' McLeod to\ngive his address. immediately. In the\nsplendid talk which he made, the Gov\nernor made a plea for a return to\nfundamentals.\nReports of departments were next\ngiven by the chairman.

Mrs. W. B. Burney made\nan appeal for co-operation with her\ndepartment-literature and receiproc\nity. The Division of Music was fully\nand interestingly reported by Mrs. H.\nM. Stuckey, chairman of the depart\nment. The report of Mrs. Jennings,\nDistrict Vice President, was inspiring,\nbecause it told of the splendid work\ndone by the district during the year.\nShe reminded the convention that the\ndistrict has held the gavel for general\nexcellence for the past three years and\nurged the clubs to keep up this stan\ndard of work. The meeting then ad\njourned for lunch.\nAt the afternoon session the reports\nof the departments were continued,\neach of them presented in an interest\ning and forceful manner. Miss Min\nnie MacFeat of the Child Welfare Di\nsvision, made a moving plea for the\nchild, stressing the fact that "every\nchild is everybody\'s child." "South\nCarolina spent ninety-six millions for\nautomobiles and nineteen millions for\nthe education of her children last\nyear," said Miss Wil Lou Gray, who\nput before the convention the four\nobjects for which her dlepartment is\nstriving, viz: proper recognition of\nthe State Superintendent\'s omiee; pro\npeor recognition of the County Super\ni ntendent\'s office; seven months school\nterm and a library appropriation of\neight thousjand dollars. The report of\nMrs. McL. McDonald on health wvork\nwas a splendlid one. Mrs. Duncan Mc..\nKenzie of the department of Com\nmunity Service made qn appeal for\n.service on the part of club members.\nMrs. 5. 0. Plowvden mentioned the\nfact that South Carolina is the moth\ner of Home Demonstration Work and\nalso of club markets and told of some\nof the work that is being accomplish\ned through these agencies. The State\nPublicity Chairman asked for co\noperation in her work and reminded\nthe women that her\'s is an empty of\nfice without such co-operation. One\nof the most interesting reports given\nwas that of Mrs. P. E. Scott who is\nchairman of the Conimittee on Friend\nly Co-operation with Ex-Service Men.\nMrs. Scott told of the ways in which.\nthe clubs can serve these men and\nstressedl the fact that such service is\naM~issila Russell off\'ored help\nfrom Winthrop and readi a list of sug\ngestedl programs for club use, these\nprograms to be voted upon and the\nfavorite made a part of the extension\ncourse at Winthrop.

F. Con\nradi, Entomologist, who says that by\nefficient fall farm management the\nfarmer can dictate to a great extent\nhow many weevils shall pass the win\nter on the farm.\nThough much warning has already\nbeen given by the entomologists, and\nthough county agents are preaching\nstalk destruction right and left, many\nfarmers are apparently not convinced\nof the need for immediate stalk .de\nstruction, says Prof. Conradi, and do\nnot realize that this is practically the\nmost important single step in any\nsystem of fighting the weevil.\nBoll weevils multiply in cotton un\ntil frost kills it. Many thousands of\nweevils occur in each acre of cotton.\nWeevils hibernate, that is they pass\nthe winter, only in the full grown\nstage. Ilibernation usually begins\nbegins with the coming of the first\nkilling frost. They hibernate princi\npally in cotton fields, and standing\nstalks make for them splendid winter\nhomes.\nThe most favorable condition,\ntherefore, for the successful hiberna\ntion for boll weevils is found in fields\nwhere the cotton stalks, grass, weeds,\ndead leaves, etc., are left during the\nwinter. Under such conditions the\nfarmers may expect the greatest num\nber of weevils to survive the winter.\nThere is little prospect for successful\ncotton growing under such conditions.\nThe earlier the cotton stalks are\ndestroyed, the fewer the weevils\nthat will survive the winter, and\nconsequently the smallc: the daim\nage to the next crop. As far as\npossible, the stalks should be de\nstroyed two weeks before the first\nkilling frost.\nIn some sections the stalks aro\nuprooted. piled and burned. This\nmethod is a very serious disadvant\nage in destroying a large amount\nof vegetable matter which should\nbe turned under. Whenever the\nT.1 ner is equipped with plows and\nmules so that the stalks may be l\nturned under five to six inches after\nthey have been cut down with the\nchopper, it is a very effective pl a\nA less effective method is to graze ,\noff all green rotton within a period\nof a fc w days.

While\nit is a well known fact that the weevil\nwill have his fall migration period\nfrom year to year, yet this pest mi\ngrates more or less at other seasons\nof the year. After the cotton is de\nstroyed by frost ,the pest migrates\nto gnd suitable winter quarters and\nof course in the spring it must again\nmigrate more or less to find cotton\nfields for food. For this reason the\ngreatest amount of benefit for this\noperation is obtained where farmers\nof a community band together and\ncarry out a definite fall destruction\nand farm cleaning program.\nThe earlier in the fall this is done\nthe more effective it will be. Cotton\npicking should be rushed as fast\nas possible and no time should be\nlost in getting this program in op\neration.\nDestroy the Weevil\'s Winter Resorts\nClemson College-"The earlier cot\nton stalks and other hibernating place\nare destroyed," says Prof. A. F. Con\nradi, entomologist, in discussing boll\nweevil control, "the fewer weevils\n/survve the winter. In infested\nfields it is common to find weevils at\nthe rate of 5,000 to 25,000 per acre\nat the time of first frost. It is a\nwell known fact," Prof. Conradi ex\nplains, "that the weevils develop\ning late in the fall are the ones\nmost likely \' survive the winter,\nas they are not worn out by long\nfights and the rearing of the young,\nas are the older weevils. For this\nreason developments of weevils in\nlate fall must be prevented as the\nfirst step in making the next crop. .\nAn interesting point in this con\nnection is the fact that experiments\nin Louisiana showed that when cot\nton stalks were destroyed before\nOctober 15, only 3 per cent of the\nweevils survived the winter, where\nas destruction of stalks on October\n27 allowed 15 per cent to survive;\nNov. 25, 22 per cent; Dec. 27, 29 per\ncent; between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15,\n43 per cent. It is clear, therefore,\nthat the earlier the stalks are de\nstroyed, the more effective the re\nsults will be, but that where early\ndestruction is impossible, it is bet\nter late than never.\nThe planting of a winter cover\ncrop in the present cotton fields is\nalso urged as a most important\nmeans of weevil destruction since\nweevils can not live through the\nwinter in a growing cover crop, such\nas rye, oats and vetch, or clover,\nfor the reason that in order to sur\nvive the winter the weevil must\n"dry sut" to the extent of losing\none-third of his body moisture and\nthis he can not (10 in a field where\na cover crop is growing. Cotton\nstalks not plowed under or burnted\nin a field to be planted to a cover\ncrop should he cut to pieces and\nthrown to the ground as early as\npossihle by a stalk cutter so that\nthey may be covered by the grow\ning cover crop and thus absorb\nmoisture, which mieans dleath to the\nwveev i.\nSt ill another step which should\nhe a ken nlow is the cleaning up of\ndiitch batnks, fence rows, and othier\npilaces where rubbish and trash ac\ncumiulalte0 it and aroundl the fields.\nWhat Texas Says About Destroyinig\nCottIon Stalks\nStervice of Clemson Clle:- has beent\nth, f a and winter clean-up of cottoin\nfilds~ andI hiblernaiting pilaces of the\nholl wveevilI an oneo of then most eflec\nt t 1tive easres ofV weevilI conmt r.

Weevil infestation, in spring,\nstarts from the few weevils that\npass the winter.\n2. The weevils, developing late in\nthe fall, are the ones most likely to\nsurvive the winter.\n3. Many weevils will survive the\nwinter in fields where cotton stalks,\ntogether with grass, weeds and other\nrefuse material offering shelter, are\nallowed to remain.\n4. Great nlmbers successfully pass\nthe winter in Spanish moss and in\ndead grass along fences ,ditches and\nother waste places.\n5. The weevil eats only cotton.\n6. The weevil breeds only in\nsquares and bolls.\n7. The weevil can live for several\nmonths without food while hibernat\ning and inactive.\n8. It does not become inactive\nuntil the first killing frosts.\n9. Previous to the first killing\nfrosts, it can live for only about six\ndays without food.\n10. Killing cotton growth early\nprevents new weevils breeding and\npermits only the older ones to en\nter hibernation.\n11. Very few of these older wee\nvils have sufficient vitality to pass\nthe winter successfully.\n12. Killing cotton growth early\nremoves the food of the weevil. If\nthe growth of cotton is entirely\nkilled as early as two weeks before\nfrosts, practically all weevils will\nstarve before going into winter\nquarters.\n13. Destroy cotton growth early;\nif possibly, by October 1.\n14. Merely chopping or clipping\nthe stalks will not answer, the\nstumps will throw out new growth\nideal fo rweevil food.\n15. Kill the plant entirely and\nprevent new growth by setting a\nplow shallow and burning out the\nplants, or by some equally effective\nmeans. 0\n16. Do not burn crop refuse on\nthe fields. Texas farms need this\nreturned to the soil humus. Mere\nly killing the plants as suggested in\nNo. 15 will, in most cases, secure\nthe benefit aimed at.\n17. Burn the trash along fences,\nditches and other such waste places,\nin mid-winter, and thus destroy the\nindividuals hibernating there (see\nNos. 4 and 16.)\n18. A farmer cannot prevent wee\nvils coming to his cotton in the\nspring that another person has win\ntered.\n10. Big things are accomplished\nonly by co-operation.\n20. Organize a whole community\nfor the fight.\nHow to Destroy Cotton Stalks\nClemson College-Practically every\n\'scientist ,farnier and every one else\nwho has given any thought to the\nmatter at all, has agreed that the cot\nton stalks should be destroyed as soon\nafter picking is finished as possible,\nas one of the most important steps in\nlighting the boll weevil, but there is\nstill some confusion as to the best\nmethods of destroying the stalks,\nsays. Prof. C. P. Blackwvell, Agrono\nmist, who makes the followving sug\ngestions:\nD~ecidedly the best methods is to\nplow the stalks undler thoroughly as\nsoon1 as poss5ib)le. If a farmer has\ngood plows and goodl teams and hiis\nstalks are small ,this is not a dliflicult\nmater, but it can not. be (done efl\'ee\ntively wvith a oine-horse 1)low and a\nsmall mule. Stalks of average size\ncan he turuned under with a walking\nplow an td two atverage mules or hor\'s\nes. Practically any kind of sta4ka can\nhe tur ined n uder with a thraee-horse\nr\'iding plow if a wv\'eed hook or we\ncha in is used(. La rge plows andl\ntractoirs can turn any size of stalks\netl\'ectiv~ely. It is not necessary to cut\nthe stalks before plowing them un\n(ler. Ini fact ,they Luran under\n,mnehl better it\' noit cut first.\nIf a fa rmer wishes to plant a\nsmall grain crop0l after his cotton and\ncan not get h is coue picked andl\n~nd !\noint Stock Land\nae Federal .Farm\nseveral insurance\nty.

It is true that\nthis does not get the stlaks into\nthe ground but it does get them\n:own in the green grain crop where\nthe weevil can not live throughout\nthe winter.\nDuring the early days of fighting\nthe weevil sonic entomologists rec\nommended the burning of stalks as\na method of destruction, and many\nfarmers have practiced it, but this\npractice has in nearly all cases prov\nen very bad; and it is a particular\nly bad practice in South Carolina,\nbecause our soils are deficient in or\nganic matter. In fact, lack of or\nganic matter is our first limiting\nfactor in cro pproduction, while a\ngood supply of organic matter is\nthe very foundation of our boll wee\nvil fight and is a first essential to\nsuccessful cotton production under\nboll weevil conditions. When we\nburn our stalks we burn the organic\nmatter which is so essential to suc\neess, and no greater mistake can be\nmadle in fighting the boll wveevil.\nLet us plowV our stalks under or\ncut them down in a cover crop wi\',h\nai stalk cutter but let us never burn\nthem.\nSTATVE BUDGET COMMISSION\nColumbia, Nov. 7.--The state budget\ncommission is in the mlidst of its an\nnual budget hearings, for various dec\npartments of state government, wvith a\nvie wof gathering dlata oi which to\nbaise thec budget for next year\'s apipro\npriation bill, the annual finance men\nsure adloptedl by the legislature.\n\'The commission has heard about a\niozenl departmnent leads, with regardl\nto their needls for next year, andl a\nhalf hundred more are yet to heard.\nCITATION NOTICE\nState of South Carolina,\nCountty of Charendon,\nBy J.

Plowden)\nClemson College, Nov. 7.-Last\nTuesday afternoon Captain Henry W.\nLee, of the military department and\nassistant commander of the corps of\nCadets, was seriously injured in an\nautomobile accident. Capt. Lee, ac\ncompanied by idessrs. Rudolph Logan,\nWade Woodward, and F. R. Ryan was\nmotoring to Anderson when, in an ef\nfort. to avoid striking a buggy, he\nskidded into a large tree by the road\nside. Capt. Lee was driving at about\nforty-five miles yi hour when h\nstruck the tree and his large Hud\nson automobile was completely de\nmolished. Captain Lee and Mr.\nRudolph Logan were the only occu\npants who were seriously injured. Mr.\nLogan was kept in the hospital a few\ndays but is better now. Captain Lee\nhad the misfortune of losing his eye.\nHis right arm was broken and sev\neral bones in his face were broken.\nThe Corps of Cadets sent a large\nbunch of cut flowers to Capt. Lee\nevery day since the accident. All the\nstudents deeply regret the accident\nand have expressed a sincere desire\nfor the early recovery of their injured\nofficer. Latest reports from the An\nderson Hospital, where Captain Lee\nis being treated, are to the effect that,\nalthough his cdndition is very serious,\nhopes are still entertained for his re\ncovery.\nWhen called upon to contribute to\nthe Near East Relief Fund, the Clem\nson student body responded nobly.\nLast week the student body unani\nmously voted to give ten per cent of\nClemson\'s proceeds from the Clem\nson-Carolina football game for this\nwork. This was a gift from the\nCadet Corps to the starving people in\nthe Near East and a very generous\noffering, too. It is hoped that other\ncolleges and universities will follow\nClemson\'s good example. If this is\ncarried out by others, it is evident\nthat funds for the Near East Relief\nwill be materially increased.\nEditorial trom "The Spartanburg\nHerald" "Clemson College\'s decision\nto contribute one-tenth of its share of\nthe gate receipts of the Carolina\nClemson football game to the Near\nEast Relief Fund suggests a means\nfor greatly augmenting that fund in\nthe South (luring the next few weeks.\nShould other colleges adopt the idea\na substantial amount would be real\nized for a worthy cause."\nIt. is not to be doubted that the\nClemson plan will be widely welcom\ned. Our donation to the Near East\nFund will be a real sacrifice and re\ncognized by the general public.\nOn last Sunday afternoon Cadet J.\nE. I-lodge, president of the Clarendon\nCounty\' Club, called a meeting of that\norganization for the purpose of get\nting pictuires of the Clarendon Couinty\nboys for the 1923 A nnual. We now\nhave seven Clarendon boys at Clem\n.con. They are: Cadet. JT. E. Hodge\nof Mannmng, R. F. D.1, of the Senior\nclass; Cad"\'t E. D). Plowden of Jordan,\nof the Ju:.ior class; Cadet J1. HI.

We decided to go to the beautiful\nSeneca river more than a mile .from\nthe college, for the purpose ,of taking\nthe club pictures. This we (lid and\nvisited several other places of inter\nest near the college. We were all\nglad to get together and stroll around\nfor the entire afternoon. Every mem\nber of the club was greatly benefitted\nby this meeting. It brought to us\nmemories of the days gone by when\nwe were schoolmates back \'in dear\nold Clarendon. It helped us to realize\nthat these days were gone and that\nwe were now men here in this great\nmanufacturing plant called Clemson\nCollege, where we were being ground\nand polished by skilled workmen call\ned professors, preparatory to entering\ninto the structure of that magnificent\nedifice called life. \'\n\'TOBACCO GROWERS\nGET MORE MONEY\nCeelbration in South Caorlina Belt.\nWill Make Second Cash\nAdvance\nThe directors of the Tobacco Grow\ners Coo-perative Association have\nnamed next Monday 13th as the date\nof the second cash payment to every\nmember of the Association who has\ndelivered tobacco in South Carolina\nand three border counties (f North\nCarolina.\nThousands of checks have been\nbeen mailed to officials of the Asso\nciation throughout the South Caro\nlina belt and will be distributed upon\npresentation of the participation re\nceipts by members a\' the markets\nwhere they were issueL.\nOliver J.

In a\njocular way the speaker reefrred\nto the remark of a friend as to her\nchurch having been born 1,900 years\nago on the banks of the Jordan.\nHis response was that if Methodism\nhad been born then and made the\nsame progress as it has in 183 years\nthe world would have been evan\ngelized long ago. The results of\nthis movement, the speaker said,\nhave been least in Methodists.

During t\' ^ Great War the Unit\ned States lost about 80,000 soldiers.\nDuring the same two years 180,000\npeople died of cancer.in this country.\nCancer, is now killing one out of every\nten persons over forty years of age.\n2. Mlany of these deaths are pre\nventable, s:nce cancer is frequently\ncurable, if recognized and properly\ntreated in its early stages.\n3. Cancer begins as a small local\ngrowth which can often be entirely re\nmoved by competent surgical treat\nment, or, in certain external forms,\nby using radium, X-ray or other me\nthods.\n4. Cancer is not a constitutional\nor "blood" disease; there should be\nno thought of disgrace or of "heredi\ntary taint" about it.\n6. Cancer is not a communicable\ndisease. It is not possible to "catch"\ncancer from one who has it.\n0. Cancer is not inherited. It is\nnot certain even that a tendency to the\ndisease is inherited. Cancer is so fre\nquent that simply by the law of\nchance there may be many cases in\nsome families and this gives rise to\nmuch needless worry about inherit\ning the disease.\n7. The beginning of cancer is . usu\nally painless: for this reason its in\nsidious onset is frequently overlooked,\nand is too easily neglected. Other\ndanger signals must be recognized\nand comipetent medical advice obtain\ned at once.\n8. Every persisting lump in the\nbreast is a warning sign. All such\nlumps are by no means cancer, but\neven innocent tumors of the breast\nmay turn into cancer if neglected.\n9. In women continued unusual\ndischarge or bleeding requires the im\nmediate advice of a competent doctor.\nThe normal change of life is not ac\ncompanied by increasing flowing\nwhich is always suspicious. The re\nturn of flowing after it has once stop\nped should also be considered suspi\ncious. In men any reddish color in\nthe urin is very suspicious of cancer\nin the bladder or kidney; though it is\nalso seen sometimes with ssone of\nthe bladder or kidney. Do not expect\nthe doctor to tell you what the matter\nis without making a careful physical\nexamination.\n10. Any sore that does not heal,\nparticularly about the mouth, lips or\ntongue, is a danger signal. Picking\nand iritating such sores, cracks, ul\ncerations, etc., or treating these skin\nconditions by home remedies, pastes,\npoultice, caustics, etc., is playing\nwith fire. Warty growths, moles or\nother birthmarks, especially those\nsubject to constant irritation, should\nbe attended to immediately if they\nchange in color or appearance, or\nstart to grow. Avoidance of chronic\nirritation and removal of just such\nseemingly insignificant danger spots\nmay prevent cancer.\n1.1. Persistent indigestion in mid\ndlIe life, with loss of weight and\nchange of color, or with pain, vomit\ning, or diarrhoea, call for thorough\nand competent medical advice as to\nthe possibility of internal cancer.\n12. Radium is a useful and promis..\ning means of treatment for some\nkinds of cancer, in the hands of the\nfew skillful surgeons and hospitals\npossessing sufficient quantity of this\nrare and very expensive substance;\nit must. not be thought of as a cure\nall for every form of cancer. No me\ndicine will cure cancer. Doctors and l\ninstitutes which advertise "cures with\nout the knife" play upon the patent\'s\nfear of operation ini a way that leads\ntoo often to the loss of precious time,\nand fatal delay in seeking competent\ntreatment. Go first to your family\nphysician.\n13.

E. Collins and T. A. Wright.)\nComparatively few persons know\nthat diamonds of pure water are\nmined in Arkaisas. When the Am\neriean Legion annual convention was\nheld .in Kansas City and the newly\nselected commander, Hanford MacNid\ner, was presented with an "Arkansas\ndiamond" by former Governor Charles\nH. Brough, of Arkansas, many of. thte\ndelegates imagined it was all a joke,\nand one newspaper ridiculed the idea\nthat real diamonds were found in\nArkansas. But the diamond that was\ngiven to Commander MacNider equals\nin color, brilliancy and hardness any\n,amond that comes from the great\n*Vnines of South Africa. And it was\nC\' mined in Pike County, Arkansas.\nIt is related that the children of\nearly. Dutch settlers in South Africa\nplayed with diamonds as they :night\nhave clone with valueless pretty bright\nstones before the first diamond was\nidentifi:d as such in 1809. The dis\ncovery that the "pretty stones" really\nwere diamdnds was made by accident\nIn like manner, the first diamond\nfound in Arkansag-15 years ago was\npicked up and kept metely as a \'pretty\nstone..\'\nJohn W. Iuddlestone, a f rmer,\nmade the find. He picked up a tone\nin his field one day but had no idea\nof its worth. He had formed a habit\nof collecting odd crystals and various\nspecimens of minerals with which the\nneighborhood abounds. But the stone\nthat he found on this particqlar occa\nsion was so different from any he\never had seen and gave such sharp\nglints of light that he decided to take\nit to Murfreesboro the next time ho\nwent to see if someone there could\nidentify it. Several days later, rid\ning toward Murfreesboro o na mule,\n. he noticed aonther stone alongside the\nroad which appeared much like the\none had iir his pocket. He dismount\ned and picked it up. With the toe o\nhis boot, he kicked at a small pile of\npebbles and uncovered another one.\nHe took the three to a bank in Mur\nfree oro. None of the officials knew\nwha the stones were although one\nof the men did admire the larger one\nenough that he offered Huddlestone\n50 cents for it. Huddlestone declined\nto part with it, saying he wouli rath\ner break it up and see if he could not\nidentify it. Standing in the little\ngroup of men in the bank that day\nwas Judge J. C. Pinnix, circuit judge\nin the district of which Pike County\nis a part.\n"Why don\'t you send them to a good\nJeweler and see what he says about\nthem?" suggested Judge Pinnix.\nSo Iluddlestone proceeded at once\nto wrap up the stones and send them\ni.to Charles S. Stifft in Little Rock.\nThe three stones were immediately\nrecognized as diamonds by Mr. Stifft.\nBut to get other opinions ,he forward\ned the specimen to a firm of diamond\nimporters of New York, had them in\nspected by Dr. George F. Kunz, recog\nnized as one of the authorities in Am\nerica on precious stones, vice-presi\ndent anad diamond expert for Tiff\nany\'s and also gem expert for the\nUnited States Geological Survey. The\nstones were pronounced diamonds and\nthe experts declared that they ap\npeared to be as hard and as brilliant\nas the average African diamond in\nthe rough..\nDr. Kunz was not especially moved\nby the news of the discovery. He\npointed out that diamonds.\nhad been foun din several states in\nAmerica, by single stones, and these\nwere accounted for as "stray stones,"\nthe theory being that they had been\nleft after the shifting of glaciers\nthousands of years ago. .1e so in\nformed, the Little Rock jeiveler, dlis\ncouraging any extravagant hopes un\ntil a thorough investigation might be\nmade. On learning,\' however, that\nthe stones had been found in groundl\napparently of volcanic origin or na\nture, Dr. Kunz made a special trip to\nthe Arkansas field and was greatly\nimpressed with the fact that it up\npeared to have diamonds "in place" in\ntheir native peidiotite.\nIt was expJla ined that d ijm ondrs\nwecre found in two locales, those oif\nvolcanic origin being found only in a\nblue earth called peridotite. Carbon\nat intense heat, it is sup~posed, is sub)\njectedl to tremendous priessure andl\nsuiddenily cooled by the influx of\nwater, probably in volca nic uphaeval.\nThe other~ locale of dIiamonds in quan\ntity are certain river beds hut it\nnever bus beent definitely dleternined\njust how they got there.\nThe search for information that\nimight throw light on the Arkansas\nfield brought out thme fact that many\nyears before, State Geologist Branner\nin an oficial report, had called atten\ntion to thc presence in Pike County\nof perido(tite similar~ to that found in\nthe South A frican dliamifond~ fields.\nBut while diamonds "in place" alwvays\nare found in this volcanic peridotite,\ndoes not followv that all peridotite\ncontains dianmonds. The e-rntrary isi\nthe rule, more volcanic "nipea\'\' con\ntaining non-diamond peridlotite than\notherwvise. In any event, thme Branner\nreport dlid not creat, any interest and\nno one ever thought of prospecting\nMothe r-To-Be,\nRead This\nIlera Is a woniderfual nzi.4nJ g to ail ex -\npectant znoi hersi. whein the ittleo Onie ar\niiy u, li lir i ve iiat h amoinet imore. free\n.An enainenat - phiia n ,\nexpert in this sienceii\nh as shown tioa way.

There was no way of deter\nmining if the stones existed in paying\nquantities except by developing the\njpkdand mining, under the conditions\nwas an expensive undertaking. With\'\nthe prospects seemingly .very good,\ngood, however, a small company wih\n$25,000. capital was organized under\nthe \'name, ,\'The Arkansas Diamond\nMining Company." In it were Mr.\nStifft, the Little Rock jeweler; Sam\nW. Rayburn, then president of a bank\ni nLittle Rock but. now generela\nmanager of Lord and Taylor in New\nYork; A. D. Cohn ,depdrtment store\nowner in Little Rock, and J. C.\nPinnix, the circuit judge of Pike\nCounty.\nThe little company gave Farmer\nHuddlestone $35,000 for his farm\nmuch more than its ordinary worth\nafter informing Huddlestone of plans\nwhich entailed. the prospective sink\ning of a considerable sum of money\nwith the chance of no returns. Hud\ndlestone relinquished ownership with\nthe understan(\'ing that he could re\nmain upon the property aird that he\nwould be given employment with the\ncompany.\nProgress in development of the\nproperty was very slow. It was al\nmost impossible to convince even a\nlimited number of Arkansans that\nreal diamonds were to be found in\nthe state and that there were even re\nmote possibilities in the Pike County\nfield. Work was undertake nin a\ncrude way, however, bejng confined to\n"surface scratching" and use of the\ncrudest sort of washing machines.\nAnd diamonds continued to be found.\nEnglish capital became interested\nin the "find" a short time after the\ncompany was a going concern. The\nfirm of Lewis and Marks of London,\nowners and financiers of the Roberts\nVictor Mine in South Africa, also of\nthe. Veerspoed Mine which afterward\nwas sold to the DeBeers syndicate,\nsent representatives to America to in\nvestigate and make a report dealing\nwith the new field. Harry D. Lewis,\nson of the head o fthe firm, and B.\nOppenheimer, their diamond expert,\nwho afterward was created a baronet\nby the British Government, were se\nlected for the mission.\nThe two men visited Arkansas and\nwere so impressed with conditions as\nthey found them that they expressed\na wishi to take half the capital stock\nof the company, which at that time\nhad increased its cafital to $1,000,000.\nThe prospects gave the company re\nnewed hope and the capitalization was\nfurther increased to $1,250,000. It\nwas arranged that representatives\nshould go to England for a conference\nwith the English syndicate and\nMessrs. Stifft, Rayburn and Cohn\nwere soon afterward in London. It\nwas impossible to close a deal, how\never. The London concern insisted\nupon a controlling interest in the\ncompany which the Arkansans de\nclined to give and the three officials\nreturned empty-handed.\nLacking the capital for the purchase\nof adequate machinery and rapid de\nvelopment work, the project went\nalong with little change for several\nyears. Two years ago, eastern cap\nital became interested, and a holding\ncompany for the "Arkansas Diamond\nCorporation" was formed. It became\npossible then to buy machinery. The\nnaking of this linked with the dif\nliculties of getting materials to theb\nnew field, then almost in the wilds or\nArkanssa, held up operations until\nlast fall, when the new machines fin\nally were in place, and operations\nwere begun under modern methods.\nMuch of the work now being done\nin the Arkansas field, aside from the\nmere recovery of the gems, iS of a\ntest nature. As yet it is not known\nhowv many carats pec\' load nor wi ahjt\nthe exact cost of getting stones will\nbe.

It has been deternined.\nho wever, that the field in Pike County\nembraces 6i 2aeres.

"I\nsuffered a great deal, and knew\nI must do something for this\ncondition. I suffered mostly\nwith my back and a weakness in\nmy limbs. I would have dread\nful headaches.

A nix-carat\nstone in the rough may not produce\nmore thani a two-carat cut diamond.\nThe cost of cutting and polishing is\none big alitional charge in getting\nthe final marketable gem.\nSouth African diamonds in the\nrough and subjected to a tax that\nranges from 36 to 60 per cent. The\nrough stones are sent to London\nwhere the great diamond syndicate\nhandles them. There is a charge for\nsortinjg and selling. The stones are\ndivided into "parcels" in London and\nare sold to the cutters, only a selected\nfew of whom are allowed to buy. The\nsyndicate needs no salesmen. The\ncutters in Amsterdam, Antwerp and\nNew York are notified by telegraph\nor cable that parcels of diamonds\nawait them. The buyer goes to the\nseller-not the seller to the buyer.\nThe buyer cannot haggle over pricer.\nNor can he pick and choose. He can\nnot reject some of the stones in a par\ncel an.1 have them replaced with oth\ners. He must take the parcel allotted\nto him or go without. It may be, and\nusually so happens, that all diamonds\nin a given package or parcel are not\nsuitable to the buyer\'s trade. He\nmust take them nevertheless, and sell\nwhat he does not want to other cutters\nnot on the syndicate\'s list of buyers.\nThe buyers of the parcels almost in\nvariably are cutters who make a busi\nness of converting the rough stones\ninto cut and polished gems. The\nstones which are brought into Ameri\nca bear a duty of 10 per cent. if in\nthe rough ,or 20 per cent if cut and\npolished. From the cutter, they go\nto the broker and the jobber, then to\nthe manufactuing jeweler and fronm\nhim to the wvholesaler or the retailer\nandi then to the individual.
