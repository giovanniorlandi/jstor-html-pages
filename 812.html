Ogden, pastor of, the Central Presbyterian Church, one, of the largest and wealthiest churches, in Atlanta, *Ga., will begin holding regular, services next Sunday afternoon, ?- 1 ? a- TIia, on aowniuwn sweeu wuiucio. xhe euvu, of the church will assist at the services., Dr. Ogden in applying to Mayor, Woodward yesterday for a permit,, stated that recently he had been, listening to a number of street, preachers and found that many were, "ignorant and were not giving the, people the old fashioned gospel" but, were preaching from "obscure Bible, passages which old Bible students, . find it hard to understand.", The example about to be set by, Tlr fln-xlon mav hp followed hv other, Atlanta divines. It was said by one, of the founders of Brahmanism that, jails, always locked, are generally, filled with human beings, while temples,, with their doors standing open,, are empty. The bulk of humanity, keep out of churches; hence the gospel, must be taken to them., The reverend gentleman referred tc, above, in concluding to follow the example, of disciples far more illustrious, than any of our day, casts suspicion, upon what are known as guerf, rilla preachers who are attempting, to find out what is meant by what he, is pleased tt> term obscure passages, in the Bible which old Bible students, find it hard to understand. It is suggested, that should recognized teach-?, ers make similar attempts they would, v 1 1 4 1 A, snow tnear nearers mat mcv an/, seeking the truth., But, returning to preaching in vhe, \\ open air. We think it was Ezra who, after the Babylonish captivity, im, provised a pulpit in one .of the streets, of Jerusalem and preached all day, long. Most of the people who had, returned from the seventy years\', capitivity had lost the Hebrew language, and it was necessary for the, preacher to translate all he read., Further on in the history of the, I chosen people we find the Author of, the Christian religion utilizing a, seine boat for a pulpit, as well as, mounts and wayside wells., Johp and Charles Wesley mounted, dry goods boxes, piles of pig iron,, barrels or anything else convenient, ly HI. IlcWIU III uuiui iv ajjcnn i.u fiiwupo, But to come home to own town., About forty years ago the Young:, Men\'s Christian Association conducted, street corner meetings on Sunday, afternoons. In those days pastors of, city churches often appeared with, them and delivered addresses in the, streets. Hence Dr. Ogden is about, to revive an ancient custom., ONE-RING, CIRCUS, A one-ring circus is on the road., It will during the next two or three, weeks visit Maryland and Virginia, cities and towns. Circuses generally, arrive in Alexandria during the, month of September. The show may, be coming this way., The one-ring circus brings many, recollections of by-gone days. The, Baltimore Sun devotes halt a comma, to the one referred to above. Among, x>ther things it says:, "The old-fashioned one-ring circus,, with its long train of wagons and, horses, its sleepy drivers and canvasmen., will be on its way to Skyeville, and toward the Uwns and villages, of Ma-ylar. i \\\'.cr State,, where t\'*- \' little top, is an imn, "In the?:\' .. i ? kirig: at a, c^rsus mean; - \'.- ?? three, i rings at once. ** - g of as, many platform 1 clowns,, the old-style or" - - k a joy, tc the simple <t only, bee cvcivimnj; tl< oul, only one act corrr >,K at, a time, and thr \' st as, frequently brinc\'r- 5 for, the; actor? as doin~ \'urn;.., They ,rcaU, it. ^a tert " -1 in giiiished, ,%frt)m\'the rive \' \' ~-ew, from Barnum. but it :-?s*, the same.

Senator Lee Blair, who, ! is a candidate for Governor, is runI, ning on that issue. It is suggested, i that the soaring tax rate Tn~order to, j raise money to pay the salaries of, J fifth wheels to the public coach makj, es it imperative upon the voters to, j select men who will carry out a p!ai, I form of immediate retrenchment., Senator Blair in a speech in Balti, j more last night, among other things,, I said: >?, \'\'I have been conducting this campaign, for the Democratic nomination, for the high office of governor, as 1, i did four years ago, by appealing dirI, ectly to the people., "I have stated my position frankly, j and openly on the various question.?, ^ that have arisen during the campaign,, j It may be that I have lost some votes, j by doing so. Some persons think it, ! is good politics to deal in generalities,, j and let everybody interpret them to, j mean what they want them to mean;, I but I am asking the voters of, ] the people and I do not want to get, j any votes by misrepresentation., l 0, i WOULD ABOLISH, j LEGISLATURE. !, i, i The Richmond Journal of yes, I, jterday contained the following:, j "In some of the States a move1, ment for the abolition of State Legis!, latures and Assemblies is taking definite, shape. It is conceded everyI, where that the Legislatures have, ;been failures. Newspaper and magaI, y.ine writers in Kansas review the, ; last session of the Legislature there, ,and contend that its record is one, ; of impotency and confusion. It had, presented before k hundreds of laws, I of various degrees of absurdity, inI, ., deluding one to regulate the size of, cages for canary birds and another, I to fix by statute the length of women\'s, skirts and the density of their, ! garments. These writers tell us that, ! the periodical sittings of the body are, j times of uneasiness for all business, ; interests, of uncertainty and perturIbation, among the people, and that, l lawvers fatten on the conradictionf, and boscurities of the laws put on the, books. From Ohio we have simiiat, ! tales of woe. Probably they could be, j duplicated in any State of the Union., I "The subject will become serious, land the issue will be active within a, few years. Our .State Legislatures, were born of extreme jealousy among, the States, of their own rights, of an, exaggerated devotion to ideals of democracy, which do not fit in with, practical facts. The theory, the dream,, the idea, was of free and intelligent, ; voters with full sense of their responsibility, selecting deliberately to, 1 represent them the best men they, icould find. All of us know how far, the actual conditions are from these, dreams. After a century of experience., we find our State Legislatures, i vastly inferior to those of fifty and, seventy-five years ago. The medium, , active, reading country gentleman, ; imbibling many of the elements and, standards of statesmanship, has disappeared, and could not be elected to I, ! the Legislature anywhere if he existed., The service has ceased to be a, j distinction or a mark of honor or to, \'offer opportunity to those with, worthy ambitions.
