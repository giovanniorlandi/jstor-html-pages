Harrel became enraged\nbecause things were net coming his way,\nse he wrote an "open deer" letter te\nBeckham and sent it te The Louisville\nDispatch te print and this is the let\nter,verbatim, et punctu-at-\'em, et-cetera:\nJtl\'SSELLViMiE, K, April 2, 1900.\nGoverner Beckham, Frankfort, Ky. Dear Gover Gever Gover\neor: Ne mutter what mny be individual opinion\nthere is no denying the fact thnt Shnkcspear was\nright when he snid, "Ingratitude thou mnrble\nhearted fiend." Yeu nre a young man, just start\ning out en your political career, I nm n young man\njust U\'2 years old today and there arc some things I\nwant te say te you in this letter, and whilst it may\nnet be pleasant, and may fall en deaf cars, yet I have\npulled my coat off, rolled up my sleeves and propeso\nte go right te the point. I make only one charge\nagainst you and that is, you are n "political in\ngrate" and in this letter and en the stump this fall,\nI propose te de everything in my power te make the\npeople understand and believe the same. And, by\nthe way there are ether loyal Democrats, who will\nhave same charge te make Yeu will remember that\nJehn II. Whallon and a number of newspapers made\nthe charge that I was te be the Supti of llepkinsville\nAsylum. It is immaterial whether that charge was\ntrue or false. Yeu de knew that Gov. Goebel appre\nciated my services te the party and would have had\nbackbone enough te have steed by me and all his\nether friends, that had steed se loyally by him. It\nis conceded all ever the state that you have discarded\nGoebel\'s friends, who sacrificed se much for him, as\nworn out feet mats or dirty dishrags nnd with the\nconsent and counsel of Bill Ilaldeman, a geld bug\nbelter in 1896, new make your selection of the geld\nbug variety, and unsoiled linen, hoping, I suppose,\nte pave your political future. New I want te say this\nte you, you would net be sitting en the Governer\'s\nchair today if it had net been for me, and you knew\nit. New, don\'t you think I am out of politics, I am\njust starting. Wm. Goebel en his death bed ex\npressed himself as te me, he knew I was his friend\nand had always been his friend. He knew he could\nalways rely upon me, 1 wrote him a letter the day\nafter the Commissioners refused te give him the cer\ntificate, you knew the contents of that letter, if you\nde net, Mr. Gus Coulter can inform you. New Gov Gov\nereor before I would consent te be an applicant for a,\nposition under you, I saw and talked with nearly all\nthe leaders of the party who were in Frankfort and\nmade this statement te them, 1 want you all te get\ntogether, and discuss this matter among yeurbelves\nand if you think it best for me and best for the party\nnet te be an applicant, I will net be under any cir\ncumstances for 1 love my party, and would be willing\nte make any sacrifice. Justus Goebel, Chas. Lewis\nand Chas. MrCherd headed a delegation and de\nmanded that you appoint me; you refused. Gave te\nme as your reason that The Pest and Dispatch would\nhop en you. Well I hope they will hop off of me\nnew, and will land en you with both feet, Ne. tens,\nbrogans, and br.-ad heels when I stepped en the\nfiring line te make you Governer, I knew what they\nwould de for me would be a plenty, but I had the\nnerve and backbone te de it. After throwing me\ndown, you positively refused te let me name a man\nfor the pettiest oifice in your gift. Well alright Gov Gov\nereor, I have ceme hack te my old home at llussell llussell\nville te a geed little wife and three children, grieved\nof slanderous attacks madeen,me, but we are all dead\ngame and hope we will have an election for Gov. this\nfall and if you have no opposition, I will run against\nyou and think the race dead easy I think you will\nbe about as well hobbled as I will be. The Test and\nDispatch has written fraud across your face and they\nhave been throwing dirt, bricks and wet cats at me\nubeut it, well I think they should rub out "fraud"\nand write ingratitude. I would rather be a political\nthief than a political ingrate\nVery respectfully, S. B.
