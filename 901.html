        <pre>['YIMITA B.AILY CHIEFTA1K\nVOL XIV. NO. 10.\nVINITA, OKLAHOMA, WEDNESDAY, MAY 8. 1912.\nFIVE CENTS PER COPY\nGORDON IliL\n81 GEN. WALKER\nMacon, Ga., May 7. Gen. C. Irvine\nWalker, of Charleston, S. C, commander-in-chief\nof the United Confederate\nVeterans, oa behalf of the organiza\ntion, delivered the response to the ad\ndresses of welcome at the opening of\nthe annual reunion of the veterans\nhere today. Ia beginning his addresg\nGen. Walker paid a tribute to Gen.\nGeorge W. Gordon, who died soot\nafter his election as commander-in-chief\nof the Confederate Veterans at\nthe last reunion, and of whom the\nspeaker said:\n"A wise Providence has, since we\nlast met, gathered to Himself. My\ncomrades, Gordon loved you, he treas\nured over the sacred memories of a\nhallowed past; he was proud of the\nglories which cluster around this fed\neration. May the memory of his life\nand work incite us to higher effort fof\nthe good of the United Confederate\nVeterans he so truly loved and faith\nfully served."\nAsking the question, "What is It\nthat brings to this meeting the \'boys\'\nfrom the distant corners of our far-\nspreading land?" The speaker said\n"The principals for which we fought\nwere muried under the shattered ruins\nof the Confederacy. So their main,\ntenance cannot be the reason for this\ngreat gathering. Our beloved Confed\nerate banner is but a cherished mem\nory, but, Oh, how deeply cherished?\nWe can never hope to unfurl it? We\ncar. gain nothing of material benefit\nby these re-unions. Then what power\nful impulse of pur nature draws us\nhere? It is surely some deep, vivid.\nimperishable sentiment. Is it not a\nproof of how much these old boys\'\nloved that Confederacy which\n\'Rose so white and fair,\nAnd fell so pure of crimes\'\nand of how they must have impressed\nthat devotion upon their descendants.\nJThis strong sentiment is partly the\nhappiness we anticipate and partly\nthe good we hope to accomplish. It is\na happiness to meet our dear old com\nrades and brothers, who stood by us,\nfacing death, and who served their\nbeloved country with unexampled de\nvotion unexcelled courage and grevious\nsufferings. Confederate comradeship\nis the strongest bond between man and\nman. It is a great happiness to dwell\nlovingly upon the pathetic and the\namusing incidents of our war experi\nences. It-is a happiness to meet these\nfair daughters who gather around us\nand honor us and our cause.\n"Now, what good can we expect?\n"In considering this do not forget\nthat whether we were right, as we will\nforever claim, or wrong, as our en\nemies assert, it is all now purely an\naccomic question, one which cannot In\nthe slightest degree affect our present\nprosperity or happiness. The greatest\ngood to be obtained by these reunions\nis our vindication, a justification of\nthe righteousness of the cause for\nwhich we fought. "This, not selfishly\nfor ourselves, but for our descendants.\nThen let us be sure that our children\nand their children to the remotest gen\neration; know that their fathers were\nnot rebelts but patriots, not traitors\nbut martyrs. They should Itnow that\nwe fought not for conquest, but for\ndefense, not to maintain slavery, but\nto preserve the precious rights won\nby and handed down to us by our fore\nfathers. We fought for our freedom,\n-.-our- firesides, our women and our God.\n"We accepted with loyalty our pa\nroles at the close of the war. We re\nturned to our homes to devote our\nselves to the maintenance of peace,\nharmony and concord. We took our\nnew duties, we faced every trouble, and\nwith a mighty effort triumphantly rose\nabove thousands of difficulties which\nconfronted us. The war had brought\nus ruin, desolation, defeat, but its\nhard-earned lessons, self reliance, pa\ntience, persistency and. \' courage\nbrought us success. We laid down our\nmuskets before overpowering numbers\nChildren\'s Canvas 2-Strap\nSLIPPERS\n$1.00 $1.25 $1.50\nWhite Hose\nMfLFORD-BERGER\nand immeasurable resources. We\nseized the Implements of peace, grap\npled every\' obstacle and finally con\nquered. "Fellow citizens of Macon, the men\nwho have done all this, the survivors\nof and participants in the greatest war\nof all time and the conquerers in that\nsubsequent industrial struggle, are be\nfore you the grandest heroes the world\never saw. Consider them well, you\nwill never see their like again!"\nIn conclusion Gen. Walker said:\n"To you all we, your guests, bend\nour beads, open our hearts, and offer\nour hands In acknowledgement of all\nthe princely hospitality you so lavinsh\nly shower upon us. We come to you,\nnot now to staunch our bloody wounds,\nnot for your loving care, but In health\nand In old age, to ask you to join us\nin forever up-holding the precious\nmemories of a noble past and aid us\nIn proving to the world that\n" \'Eternal right, though aU close fail,\nCan never be made wrong.\' "\nA LETTER FROM WATSILA.\nMr. Chieftain that newspaper way\nto Vinita:\' I going to write it me, you,\nthis time cause it heep some bodies\ntell It me and say it you write it some\nmore in Chieftain we like it see you"\ntalk it politic that kind.\nWell I been watch it papar see it\nwho tis going to run it for office in this\nCraig countq This Injun look it in\ncolumns in paper and see it Bob Nix\nstill got it her name nounce it for\nclerk and ask it democlat mans to help\nit her at primary August 6th next\ntime.\nI going to tell it Mr. Voter every\nbody you that Bob Nix she cant git it\noffice. tall next time.

When the vote\nwas taken four of the five aldermen\ni voted for the reduction and one re\nfused to vote. The motion was made\nI to the effect that it was the sense of\n, the council that the reduction should\n(be made as above and requesting the\ni mayor to reduce the force accordingly.\nThe mayor has assumed the responsi\nbility for the overburdened police de\npartment and the council took the ac\ntion last night in order to give the\npeople an understanding of the rea\nson the city has so many policemen.\nIn the course of the discussion the\nj words against the arbitrary methods\nof the mayor waxed warm, so warm in\nfact that there was little room left to\ndoubt the opinion of the mayor held by\nthe council.\nThrough the routine business of the\nsession the meeting progressed with\nout mishap. A petition for and a pro\ntest against the building of a sidewalk\nj on the west side of North Brown street\nwas referred to the special improve\nment committee with power to take\nsuch action as is deemed necessary.\nSeveral other sidewalk petitions were\nreferred to the same committee. . The\nmatter of erecting a bridge across Bull\ncreek, at the intersection of Third\nstreet and Sequoyah avenue was taken\nup and referred to the special improve\nment committee, with, instructions to\n\'\'take up the matter of the county pay\ning half the cost o fthls bridge, with\nthe county commissioners. If the coun\nty board agrees to this It is probable\nI a special meeting of the council will\nbe held at an early date at which time\nau election will be called for the pur\npose of authorizing the council to make\nthe expenditure necessary for build.\ning a substantial bridge at this place,\ni The state laws require that all ex\npenditures of over $300 must be au-\nthorized by a vote of the people.\nj Au ordinance amending the license\nordinance of the city regulating ped\ndlers, etc., to Include agencies for\nlaundries outside of Vinlta was pre\nsented and referred to the ordinance\ncommittee for further rconsideration.\nI Street Commissioner Busey present\ned a bill for ?508 for back salary as\nstreet-commissioner, alleging that he\nhad at all times since bis election held\n( himself in readiness to do the street\nwork of the city, but others had been\nemployed to do the work, and that he\nfelt that he was entitled to his per\ndiem wages. The bill was rejected by\nI the council for the reason that the\nI street and bridge fund of the city is\ni exhausted and the city has no fund\nfrom which the bill can be paid and\nfor the further reason that Mr. Busey\nperformed no real service for the city.\nI A bill for the payment of work done\nin constructing a bridge across Bull\ncreek failed because Alderman Marrs\n( voted against the bill, giving as a rea\nson that there was no fund from which\nthe bill could be paid. A biu for street\nI grading to the amount of $180 was lost\nfor the same reason. There were but\n;five members present and without a\n( unanimous vote of those present the\nj claim could not be allowed. These bills\nI were for work that appeared neces\n, sary, but which, under Judge Davis\'\nconstruction of the law cannot be paid.\nR. J. Wright was elected to fill the\nvacancy on the council, created by the\nremoval of Jasper Martin from the\ncity.\nThe council was in session until\nneaTly midnight, and filially adjourned\nwithout passing the usual finance ordi\nnance, this measure failing for the rea\nson that Alderman Marrs refused to\nvote for the ordinance while it con\ntained the item for the bridge work.\nCard of Thanks.\nWe wish to thank pur frir-nds and\nneighbors for their kindness and as\nsistance during our lato bcr.\' uvement.\nW. E. WORRELL AND FAMILY.\nL. A. LANDERS AND EFFIE\nSIHEf.il\ni u\nDaily Newspapers of Independent\nStrain Believe Wilson is the\nStrongest.\nWashington, D. C, May 8. (Special)\nIn the contest for the democratic\npresidential nomination Governor Wil\nson has the united support of the inde\npendent press. No presidential candi\ndate In all the history of the country\nhas been accorded the support of so\nmany independent papers, and cer\ntainly no presidential candidacy has\nbeen accorded the support of so many\npapers that have heretofore been align\ned with the opposition party. The Mil\nwaukee Journal, an independent paper\nof great influence, has Indicated that\nit will support Governor Wilson in the\nevent of his nomination, and there is\nauthority for saying that it will not\nsupport any other democrat. The Jour\nnal\'s support of Governor Wilson is\ntypical of that of most of the great in\ndependent newspapers. ,\nBy way of contrast it can be truth\nfully asserted that the candidacy of\nSpeaker Clark, the nearest rival of\nGovernor Wilson for the nomination,\nis without the support of any Inde\npendent Journal of, influence In the en\ntire nation.\nA few editorial expressions, giving\nthe views of leading Independent pub\nlications with reference to the choice\nof the democratic presidential candi\ndates, are set forth herewith:\n(Indianapolis Journal.)\n"It Is very far from certain that\nPresident Taft will be defeated at the\npolls. This depends upon what the\ndemocrats do at. Baltimore. If they\nshould nominate Clark or Harmon,\nTaft would have a great advantage and\nwould probably win. But if the demo\ncrats could once at least be saved from\nblundering and should nominate a\nthoroughgoing progressive like Wood\nrow Wilson, democratic victory would\nbe just about inevitable. There is very\nlittle doubt that Wilson could carry\nWisconsin against Taft, and he would\nprobably carry a number of other pro\ngressive republican states in the west\nand northwest."\n( Collier\'s Weekly.).\n"Champ Clark will go to Baltimore\nwith some strength of his own, and\nthe present plan is to throw the Har\nmon votes to him, as it would probably\nbe impossible to throw his to Harmon\nor Underwood Hearst perhaps get\nting the. nomination for vice president,\nor( perhaps, being satisfied with\nstrengthening his pulls in the states\nwhere he dabbles in political patron\nage. "This is somewhat neat, and it may\nt\nNotice the display of\nNew\nRoom-Size\nand\nSmall Rugs\nDrapery Fabrics\nEt\nin our windaw\nWe carry complete stocks\nof Linoleum, J Matting,\nKerch\'s Brass Window\nFixtures, Window Shades\nEtc\nmm\nBUTTERICE PATTERNS FOR JUNE\nAre here, also Fashion Sheets, Delineators, Etc.\nMisses\' and\nChildren\'s\nUndermuslin\n20 Per Cent Off\ngo through. If it does, Taft is more\nlikely to be renominated. In that case\nClark will get about the normal demo\ncratic vote, and Taft the regular re\npublican vote plus more than half of\nthe independent vote, and be easily re\nelected. Annexation speeches may be\nexpected from Clark at intervals dur\ning the campaign, and deals\' equal In\nmoral fiber to his leaving the speaker\'s\nchair to take consplcouous part in\nthe pension grab. If Roosevelt is nom\ninated he will beat Clark so badly\ntber will be practically no race. If\nhe Is nominated, it Is difficult, Indeed,\nto think of any democrat except Wil\nson who can give him a sporting run.\nBetween those two, Roosevelt would\nhave the advantage of his exampled\nvigor, popularity, and political knowl\nedge, and Wilson the advantage ofxa\nclear and sound position on the tariff\nand the trusts likely to be the two\ngreat issues, and a splendid power of\nthought und speech. It is extremely\nlikely, however, that ;te democrats\nwill throw away their chance, as usual,\nand put up some ordinary compromise,\nlike Clark, and hand\nthe republicans."\nthe election to\n(The New York Evening Post.)\nY\'Chump Clark\'s victory In Illinois\nought to rouse every democrat who\nbelieves in sarie and effective leader\nship. As a presidential candidate the\nspeaker would be one of tho most ab\nsurd figures ever seen on the stump.\nSuccess would" be Impossible for his\nparty. His backing by Hearst, which\nhe thankfully acknowledges, would\nalone be sufficient to ruin his chances.\nCompetent politicians inform us Hint,\nIn their judgment, his campaign would\ncollapse in eight weeks after the con\nvention. It is known, too, that Presi\ndent Taft believes that Clark would\nbe the easiest democratic candidate\nfor him to defeat. Witlr Clark as its\nspokesman, the democracy would again\nbe the butt of the country, because of\nits propensity for Inexcusable blunder\ning. Its exceptional chance 10 win lie\ncause of the republican split would be\nthrown away at the start. Most of the\nindependent democratic newspapers\nwould be compelled to support the, re\npublican candidate, so obvious is the\nspeaker\'s unfitness for the White\nHouse. A big barrel, congressional\ncourtesy, which always is available for\na fellow-representative, and a gross\npopular misconception of Mr. Clark\nand: his abilities are responsible for\nthe stare his candidacy has got.

He was the founder of the faith,\nas an historic religion; and He is the\nideal of character at which Ilia dis\nciples are expeoted and commanded to\naim. His central commandment was,\n"follow Me." "Come.yo after Me."\n"The Imitation of Christ" was the cen\ntral duty of Christianity, as Jesus Him\nself preached it. In this fact, we have\na touchstone to test the validity and\ntruth of the various theories concern\ning the Person of Christ which have\nprevailed at different times In the\nchurch. Any theory which makes\nJesus a Being which it is useless for\nus to try to Imitate, is condemned by\nthat fact,\nn j8 not\nTbat one fact shows that\nin harmony with he Chris-\ntlanity of Christ.\nIt may be asked, Why Bhould we try\nto form a theory concerning Jesus\nChrist? Why should we not take Him\nfor granted, just as we take Socrates\nor Emerson? This Ignores the fact\nthat we have a theory of Socrates or\nEmerson. We know that they are\nmen, and only men; of one nature and\nof like passions with ourselves. We do\nnot inquire concerning them, because\nwe are already sure. If we were not,\nwe should be obliged to inquire and\nspeculate. We are so made that we\nare compelled, by the necessjt\'es of\nour own nature, to try to understand\nany fact with which we have to deal.\nMysteries are a challenge to the in\ntellect. We grow by the efforts we\nmake to penetrate th-em. Jesus Christ\nhas stamped Himself upon history In\nsuch a way as to suggest the Inference\nthat He was a Being of more exalted\nnature than Socrates or Emerson. No\nother personage in history has suc\nceeded In convincing a monotheistic\npeople that He was a special and pe\nculiar und unique manifestation of\nGod. That fact the fact of the cur\nrent belief concerning Jesus, arising\nin tne ciiutcn even wiiile there were\nsome alive who knew Him In person,,\nand knew HIM intimately creates the\nproblem of Jesus. ,. Even Plato and\nXenophon never believed that Socrates\nwas a God. The various doctrines of\nthe divinity of Christ are attempts to\nexplain what it was in the nature of\nChrist which enabled Him to give the\nimpression He did to .the church He\nfounded.\nThe ordinary "orthodox" doctrine of\nthe divinity of Christ is not, at least\nas a whole, derived from the New Tes\ntament. It is a blend of New Testa\nment teaching with, the speculations of\nGreek philosophy. As formulated by\nthe Council of Chalcedonrin 451 A. D.(\nit involves absolute intellectual con\ntradictions. Jesus is affirmed to be\n(continued on last page)\nS\nOne Big Lot\ni\n\' Suits \' 1\n25 Per Cent Off\nJ\nI.ANDKRfi,', 'The Cash Store With the Little Prices\n2L2\nt\nThe Great Avalcening Begins at the\n7T TJ\nU 1 u\nVi\nm m mm\nV\n9\n9\no\no\no\na\n.cn\nCD\nfD\nci\ner Cent Discount\na\nu\no\n.\nJut to introduce the new Golden Rule to the people of Vinita and vicinity, we are going to give you a reduc\ntion of 25 PER CENT on every article purchased from the Golden Rule, Saturday, May 11.

Imthe class!\ncal forms of this theory He has been\ncredited with a divine consciousness.\nThat Is. an Infinite consciousness. You\nthus have a finite person, with an In\nfinite consciousness. A Being who\nJives In time, and thinks In eternity. It\nwould take too much time, and be too\nmuch of a tux upon my readers, to at\ntempt to run out the absurdities to\nwhich this conception would lead, if\ncarried to its logical conclusions. The\nablest and keenest theologian of the\nold school In America, Trofessor B. B\n.VarhVId of Princeton, used to confess\nto Lis classes that this theory pre\nsented a Christ who was inconceivable\nto the human Intellect. But what is\nfar more serious, It presents a Christ\nwho cannot be the ideal of human con\nduct and aspiration. He is utterly re\nmoved by nature from ourselves. He\nIs Omniscient while we are ignorant.\nHe has all knowledge, while we only\nlearn slowly and painfully, He has the\nplenitude of divine power, while we\nonly gradually acquire strength\nthrough conflict. To tell us to imitate\nthis Being, Is like telling a six months\'\nchild to enter a Marathon race with the\nworld\'s champion. Hence, among\n"orthodox" believers the conception of\n"Imitating Christ" has fallen Into the\nbackground, and that of "believing in\nChrist" has taken its place.\nIf this theory Is only partly of New\nTestament origin, and In part the cre\nation of the philosophy of the fifth cen\ntury, have we not a right, when that\nphilosophy has been outgrown, to try\nto unite the New Testament teaching\nwith the philosophy of our own time,\nand formulate a new doctrine for our\nselves? The philosophy of our time\nhas two characteristics. It believes\nthat God dwells lu all things. And it\nbelieves that all things are what they\nare as the result of the process of evo\nlution. The whole universe is thus\nthe progressive,\' ever-expanding incar\nnation of God. Everything that lives\nis a revelation of His nature. The\nheavens display Hi orderliness. The\nmountains His power. The flowers,\nthe tenderness of His nature, The\nanimals, the fullness and variety of\nHis Life. Man reveals the possession,\nby the Infinite Ground of things, of\nself-consciousness, reason, will and\nlove, Man Is the highest revelation of\nGod. Reveals more of God than any\nlower order of Being. And the Perfect\nMan would be the completest revela\ntion of God which could be given in\nterms of this universe. And that Per\nfect Man is Jesus Christ. He Is not\nGod and Man. He is the Final Revela\ntion of God because He Is the Ultimate1\nArrived !\nH3,\nJ3 El i DA\nArrived !\nembodiment of the Ideal which strug-,\nglet for realization in each one of us.\nHe makes clear the truths concerning\nGod which we could only dimly guess\'\nat from the contents of our own hearts. .\nHe In no more question of two natures\nthan there is in each one of us.
