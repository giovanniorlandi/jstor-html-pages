        <pre>["BOOK REVIEWS\nON THE MIDDLE EAST\nISRAEL DIVIDED: IDEOLOGICAL POLITICS \nIN THE JEWISH STATE. B y  Rael J ean Isaac. \n(Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University \nPress, 1976. 227 pages, selected bibliography and \nindex, $10.95.)\nAfter the June War in Israel, two extremist \nmovements developed and affected the internal de\xad\nbate on foreign policy: the Land of Israel Move\xad\nment and the Peace Movement. Isaac's treatment \nof the origins, aims, and dynamics o: these two \nmovements is impressive, with information about \nIsrael’s borders, national purposes, and social-po\xad\nlitical institutions.\nAlvin Z. Rubinstein \nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nIN THE ANGLO-ARAB LABYRINTH: THE MC- \nMAHON-HUSAYN CORRESPONDENCE AND \nITS INTERPRETATIONS 1914-1939. By Elie \nK edourie. (New York and London: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 1976. 330 pages, works cited and \nindex, $32.50.)\nThe availability of the British Foreign Office \nrecords of World War I has enabled Elie Kedourie \nto provide us with new insights into British-Arab re\xad\nlations during the 1914—1920 period. The work of \na distinguished historian, this study will be of par\xad\nticular interest to specialists on the Middle East \nand on British foreign policy making. The schol\xad\narship is impressive.\nA.Z.R.\nSAUDI ARABIA AND OIL DIPLOMACY. By \nSheikh  R ustum Ali. (New York: Praeger Pub\xad\nlisher, 1976. 197 pages, bibliography and index,\n$18.50.)\nSaudi Arabia’s use of oil as a lever in diplomacy \nis examined historically, with particular emphasis \non Saudi policy during and after the 1972 October \nWar. The author contends that the Arab oil \nweapon has limited value in bringing about a set\xad\ntlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute. He notes that \nthe quadrupling of oil prices in 1974 was more \ndamaging to the poor nations than to the rich ones.\nA.Z.R.\nSOVIET PROPAGANDA: A CASE STUDY OF \nTHE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT. By Baruch \nA. H azan. (New Brunswick, N. J . : Transaction \nBooks, 1976. 293 pages, index, $22.50.)\nThe Soviet Union spends an enormous amount \nof money on propaganda to alter the behavior of \nspecific countries and groups. This study reviews \nSoviet instruments and organizations. More im\xad\nportant, it shows how Soviet propaganda is used in \nthe context of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nA.Z.R.\nOPEC: SUCCESS AND PROSPECTS. By Dank- \nwart A. R ustow and J ohn F. M ugno. (New \nYork: New York University Press, 1976. 179 pages, \nappendices and index, $12.50.)\nThis primer traces the evolution of OPEC’s or\xad\nigins and aims and the political and economic \nchanges in the world petroleum market since 1973. \nThe authors believe that OPEC is a durable orga\xad\nnization, which has lent impetus to the general \nproblem of channeling “cumulative transfers of \nreal income from the industrial to the oil-produc\xad\ning countries.”\nA.Z.R.\nTHE ARABS IN ISRAEL. By Noam C homsky. \n(New York: Monthly Review Press, 1976. 314\npages, appendix, $12.50.)\nAn Arab lawyer, who formerly lived in Israel, \nprovides a detailed examination of the areas in \nIsraeli society in which Israeli Arabs find them\xad\nselves second class citizens. For example, Jews \nwanting to settle in Israel are given preferential \ntreatment; Muslim Arabs are excused from mil\xad\nitary service; the socioeconomic position of the \nArab minority is not equal to that of the Jewish \nmajority: and the Arabs tend to be viewed as se\xad\ncurity risks.\nA.Z.R.\nARAFAT: THE MAN AND THE MYTH. B y  \nT homas K iernan. (New York: W. W. Norton \nand Company, 1976. 281 pages and index, $9.95.)\nRelying primarily on information elicited from \nrelatives and acquaintances of Yasir Arafat, the \nauthor has patched together a readable, occasion\xad\nally overly romanticized portrait of the Palestinian \nleader. Only 14 pages treat Arafat’s rise (and de\xad\ncline?) since 1967, certainly a serious shortcoming. \nThere is little discussion of Arafat’s leadership \nqualities or his inability to bring extremist factions \nto heel.\nA.Z.R.\n(Continued on page 42)\n28\n", 'Thus the stage was set for the October War of \n1973. Although Israel emerged victorious by military \nstandards, her victory was not total, and the Arabs \ndid not suffer total defeat. To the Israelis, partial \nvictory was frustrating and humiliating; the Arabs, \non the other hand, surveyed their display of initiative \nand resistance as positive gains, a kind of victory over \ntheir previous military record. The Israeli military \nsetback at the outset of the hostilities and Israel’s \npolitical concessions to the Arabs after the cease-fire \nprovided exactly the psychological boost the Arabs \nneeded to enter into negotiations from what they felt \nto be a position of strength.\nIn the last 28 years, and particularly between 1967 \nand 1973, Israel has progressed rapidly in her scien\xad\ntific and technological achievements, especially in the \nareas of economics, defense and education.\nAs Jews around the world advanced in the fields of \nscience, medicine, and the arts, Israel became the \nnatural recipient of their knowledge and experience, \nin addition to money and military equipment.\nIn Israel, social, economic and military develop\xad\nments in the occupied territories were geared to pro\xad\nvide better conditions for the Arab Palestinians, to \nreduce the fedayeen influence and to demonstrate \nIsrael’s willingness to work with the Arabs. But the \ndevelopment of good working relations at personal, \nbusiness and government levels between Israelis and \nArabs on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip made \nthe Arab leaders, particularly President Anwar Sadat \nof Egypt, apprehensive of Israel’s “true” objectives.\nIsrael has never before exercised military dom\xad\ninance in an area where there was a conflict of in\xad\nterests between the United States and the Soviet \nUnion. Israel’s military establishment has increased \nits influence. Thus, especially toward her adver\xad\nsaries, Israel’s policies have become flavored by the \nmilitary. In the wake of the Six Day War, however, \nIsrael failed to demonstrate a capacity for diplomatic \nachievement equivalent to her capacity for military \naction.\nWhile it may be too early to assess the long- range \nimplications of the second interim agreement between \nIsrael and Egypt, concluded on September 1, 1975, \nseveral developments are likely to improve the pros\xad\npects for peace between the Arab states and Israel.\nThe civil war in Lebanon, which at first disrupted \nrenewed peace efforts between the Arab states and \nIsrael, has actually increased the chances for a second \ninterim agreement between Israel and Syria. The \nPLO, notorious in its opposition to the very existence \nof Israel, has suffered severe losses in the wake of its \nadventure in Lebanon. Egypt has been slowly re\xad\ncovering from a loss of prestige.\nThe social and economic contacts that many \nLebanese have developed with Israel could be the \ninitial seeds of an Israeli-Lebanese reconciliation.\n42 •  CURRENT HISTORY, JANUARY, 1977\nRegardless of the outcome of the Lebanese civil war, \nneither the PLO on its own nor the Syrians wish to \nprovoke Israel into a new confrontation.\nKing Hussein of Jordan continues to operate with \npolitical flexibility; as long as King Hussein survives, \nJordan will not go to war with Israel nor allow the \nPLO to return to Jordan in any strength.\nThe inherent contradiction between the national \naspirations of Arabs and Israelis over the years \nstemmed from an ignorance of Arab needs on the \npart of the Israelis and from a lack of understanding \nof Israeli nationalism on the part of the Arabs. For \nIsrael, and Jews in general, nationalism means sur\xad\nvival itself in a hostile world. For the Arabs, national\xad\nism means Arab unity, Islamic solidarity, economic \ndevelopment, and independence from Western colo\xad\nnialism. Israel, understandably, has always refused \nto compromise her right to exist as a nation; most of \nthe Arabs, on the other hand, have been unable to \nreconcile their social, political and military misfortunes \nwith the continued presence of Israel.\nTwenty-eight years of Arab-Israeli confrontation \nhave introduced psychological, social, economic, \npolitical and military changes in the region. A new \nequilibrium has been shaped, based not necessarily \non military forces but rather on mutual needs and \nmutual vulnerability. This fragile balance offers an \nopportunity that the antagonists in the drama should \nnot let pass by. M\nBOOK REVIEWS\n(Continued from page 28)\nMiscellany\nTHE EXECUTIVE, CONGRESS, AND FOR\xad\nEIGN POLICY: STUDIES OF THE NIXON \nADMINISTRATION. By J ohn  Lehman. \n(New York: Praeger Publishers, 1976. 247 pages, \nbibliography and index, $18.50.)\nThe struggle between the executive and the Con\xad\ngress over foreign and defense policy is a timely \nand important theme. In this scholarly, well-doc\xad\numented, and ably argued study, Lehman examines \nthe historical, constitutional, and political dimen\xad\nsions of the problem, providing detailed case stud\xad\nies of the congressional response to the Cambodian \naffair in 1970, the renewal of the United States \nbase rights agreement with Spain, and the overall \nissue of American commitments abroad.\nA.Z.R.\nPOLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN KOREA. By \nDae-Sook Suh  and C hae-Jin Lee. (Seattle: \nUniversity of Washington Press, 1976. 272 pages, \nappendix, notes and index, $9.50.)\nThis is a well-documented history of the political \nleaders of both North and South Korea.\nO.E.S. ■\n']</pre>
