In this regard the article will \nhighlight three characteristics of what a credible church meant for Bonhoeffer. After \nunpacking Bonhoeffer’s theological arguments in this regard, they will then be applied \nto our own context.\nKey words\nBonhoeffer; ecclesiology; spirituality; authenticity\n1. A brief introduction into Bonhoeffer’s ecclesiology \nThe vast literature on Bonhoeffer’s ecclesiology today confirms the fact \nthat he had a very particular interest in the church of his day. Not only \ndid the church form the central theme of his theological reflections, but \nhis theological endeavour was almost exclusively in service of the church. \nIn fact his work and writings were continuously, as his life unfolded in \ndifferent contexts, shaped and employed to help the church in a time of \nextreme pressure and persecution to stay true to its own identity (Godsey \n1960:17).\nIn this regard Bonhoeffer throughout his life was intrigued by the mystery \nthat the church as a human entity or institution could also at the same \ntime act as the bearer of God’s revelation in Christ – that is as the place \n', '14 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nwhich God chose to make his will for the world visibly known and tangible. \nAfter Bonhoeffer, in an ironic twist of his life, discovered in Rome that the \ninstitutional church can indeed, through its colourful liturgies and rituals, \nserve as a vehicle of God’s grace to ordinary people, the life and witness of \nthe church became his main focus as he embarked on his doctoral studies \n(Wind 1990: 31-33; GS VI:60-73). \nThe big problem addressed in Sanctorum Communio – his somewhat \nambitious and overly academic doctoral dissertation – can be articulated \nin the following question: “How can the church as a community of saints \nempirically exist or operate as a social institute?” (Berger 1962:57)\nUnlike scholars like Troeltsch and Barth who, although for different \nreasons, relativized the visible church and its meaning for the world, \nBonhoeffer in Sanctorum Communio developed a theory in which he \nnot only fully accepted the importance of the empirical church, but also \ninsisted on a close connection or coherence between the concrete church \nand its theological essence (Koegelenberg 1990:142). In fact, it was his \nconviction that the mystery of the church will only be properly understood \nif we constantly keep this close unity between the human and divine \ndimensions of the church in mind.\nIt was Wolfgang Huber who, in one of the more significant contributions \non Bonhoeffer’s ecclesiology, showed how Bonhoeffer’s struggle to retain \nthis unity between what he called the essence and the empirical shape of \nthe church, that is between the truth which the church confesses and the \nmanner in which this truth is proclaimed, lived and structured, played a \ncentral role throughout his life (Huber 1985:170).\nIt is important to remember that Bonhoeffer’s efforts to clarify and resolve \nthis ecclesial problem did not remain, as reflected in his ground-breaking \ndissertation a purely academic interest or exercise. As the political and \nsocial pressure mounted – due mainly to Hitler’s racial policies and the \nparalyzing effect it had on the authority and form of the official German \nchurch – the gap between, what Lange (Lange 1967:526) calls, the existing \nempirical church and the church that had, in term of its theological essence, \nstill to be visibly realised, became bigger. Hence the question was no longer \njust to theoretically understand and clarify the theological mystery of the \nempirical church. \n', '15Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nThe question now was of a more urgent and practical nature namely how \nthe empirical church can really become the true church in times of extreme \npressure and blackmail. Or in terms of our theme: How can the church, \nwhile living through the fire, retain its unique identity, meaning? “How \ncan it still visibly and concretely express and hold on to its confession, \ndespite extreme pressure and even persecution, thereby proving itself to \nbe a credible witness to Christ in the world? And that not only through its \npreaching, but especially through its actions and life form, that is through \nthe way it also visibly assembled, structured and managed its institutional \nlife? \nFor Bonhoeffer this concretely structured life form of the church which was \nconstantly evoked and also challenged by the Word of God, was not only \nsupposed to reveal its essence as the body of Christ – it was also meant to \nserve as the critical norm for the quality of the truth it claimed to exemplify \nand serve (Honecker 1963:138). Because in practice – and that happened as \nthe Confessing Church became more compromised and was drawn into \nHitler’s war by allowing their pastors to be conscripted into war work – \nthe church was able through its preaching and confessions to subscribe to \nsound teaching, while at the same time live a lie. \nThis struggle to help the church counter the lie and become a credible \nwitness for Christ, especially through its life form and actions, should \nhowever not only be seen as the central theme in Bonhoeffer’s ecclesiology, \nthus lying, in the words of Eberhard Bethge “Ganz am Kerne” (Bethge: \n1990, Personal interview), that is: at the very heart of Bonhoeffer’s thoughts \n– it should also be distinguished from the more popular quest to be simply \nrelevant. \nThis latter statement is quite important. Because more than the search to \nbe credible the quest to be relevant, which characterizes so many of the \ncurrent churches’ efforts to survive, often remains trapped in strategies that \nare solely opportunistic and pragmatic. These strategies often play up to the \ntraditional sentiments and claims of the so called weak and thus ignore or \nput on hold the more crucial question – often posed by the more prophetic \nvoices in the church – regarding the true identity of the church and how \nthe struggle to uphold should eventually inform the necessary strategies. \n', '16 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nAccording to Huber this was the great contribution of Bonhoeffer’s \necclesiology, however fragmented and open it was. In die words of Huber: \n“Bonhoeffer’s contribution to the problem of appropriate church \naction, showed that as far as the theological ground for such actions \nwas concerned, it made no sense to isolate the question regarding \nthe right strategy for church action from the question regarding the \ngrounds and the goal for such action. The efficiency of the church’s \naction can never be properly tested independently of the reflection on \nthe theological grounds for such an action.” (Huber 1985:200-201). \nThis brings us to a further interesting perspective with regard to \nBonhoeffer’s ecclesiology. Given that Bonhoeffer’s struggle for the church’s \ncredibility was throughout his life at the very heart of his theology, the \ncredibility question thus also provides an important key to the continuity \nin Bonhoeffer’s thoughts concerning the church. \nThe debate about the continuity in Bonhoeffer’s ecclesial thought, was \nintroduced more pertinently by the East German theologian Hanfried \nMüller who argued in his book “Von der Kirche zur Welt” (Müller \n1956) – which was, by the way, the first systematic study of Bonhoeffer’s \ntheology after the war – that there was towards the end of Bonhoeffer’s \nlife, specifically when he became more disillusioned with the Confessing \nChurch’s inability to address the challenges of the hour, a definite break or \na qualitative leap in Bonhoeffer’s ecclesiological thought (Müller 1963:49). \nThe argument would then be that specifically during the time of his Ethics \nand his imprisonment, when he was reflecting on the responsibility of the \nChristian community and especially on the role of religion, first of all in a \nmisguided society, but also in a secular environment, we have, according to \nErnst Lange, a so called functionalization of the church, thus a move which \ndeliberately undervalued its institutional structure or role and reduced \nits identity to humane deeds of solidarity and fellow-feeling, especially \ntowards those that suffer (Lange 1967: 544). \nThis viewpoint is not widely supported today. Even when Bonhoeffer later \nin his life focused more strongly on the secular meaning of the gospel, \ndefining the church’s role more pertinently within this context, it did not \nrender the empirical church totally irrelevant or redundant. Neither was \n', '17Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nthe church’s theological essence or identity at this stage understood only in \nterm of its worldly function. (Peters 1987:170-171). \nWhile the political turmoil indeed at the time made the church’s social or \nworldly involvement almost a condition sine qua non for the realization of \nits true essence or identity, this did not exclude efforts to give institutional \nstructure to this deliberate focus on the world. In fact these efforts, even \nwhen they were only visible in the work and actions of individuals, whether \nof an ecumenical, confessional or secular flavour, could (according to \nBonhoeffer’s reasoning), well serve as a vital nourishing source for a new \nform of institutional life. This conclusion is not only confirmed by the \noutline of his planned last book (WE: 413-416) – which was unfortunately \ndestroyed – but also by Bonhoeffer’s vision of how the church needed to \nexist and operate in the future.\nSo to conclude: It is clear that Bonhoeffer, exactly for the reason that the \nchurch should remain true to its own unique identity and thus be a credible \nwitness to Christ, consistently and in different ways held on to what can be \ncalled: the “dialectical unity” between the church’s essence and its ensuing \nlife form. Or put in other words: between a necessary distance from and an \ninescapable solidarity with society and its plight. \nAnd where the church failed in this regard, Bonhoeffer’s sacrificial choices, \nwhich eventually led to his death, became the ultimate symbol or example \nof how one’s beliefs and actions, confession and life can collude, making it \nclear what a credible life and witness is all about. \n2. Characteristics of a credible church \nWhat does a credible church today look like in terms of Bonhoeffer’s \nthoughts?\n(a) A church who is not afraid to embrace the apostolic tradition that \nproclaims Christ as Lord and centre of the universe \nLike with the authors of the Bible one can hardly miss that from very early \non Bonhoeffer in an almost childlike way accepted the existence and reality \nof God. Although he grew up in a liberal and partly unreligious family, \nBonhoeffer seemingly never harboured any agnostic or atheistic feelings. \n', '18 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nOn the contrary, his interest in theology and especially his choice to become \na theologian – although at first somewhat strange and embarrassing for \nhis family – over time became a taken-for- granted part of his life. This \nchoice was again inspired by and over time strengthened by a very strong, \nbut growing conviction that the God of the Bible is indeed a caring God \nwho is deeply involved in the affairs of humans, especially when their lives \nbecome strenuous, if not unbearable. \nOn occasion of his father’s 75th birthday Bonhoeffer wrote in his very first \nletter from prison to his parents the following: \n“Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of Creation…Shelters \nthee under his wings, yea, and greatly sustaineth.” He then adds: \n“That is true, and it is what we must always rely on.” (WE:31-32).\nIn his last letter from Tegel on August 23, 1944 this conviction is even more \nstrongly expressed when he writes: \n“I am so sure of God’s guiding hand that I hope I shall always be \nkept in that certainty…My past life is brim-full of God’s goodness, \nand my sins are covered by the forgiving love of Christ crucified…\nMay God take care of you and all of us, and grant us the joy of \nmeeting again soon. I am praying for you every day.” (WE:427-428).\nA few days earlier he wrote similarly: \n“God does not give us everything we want, but He does fulfil his \npromises.” And then a page further on he adds: “If Jesus had not \nlived, then our life would be meaningless, in spite of all the other \npeople whom we know and honour and love.” (WE:425-426).\nAnd then finally on the day before he was executed he held a worship \nservice referring amongst other things to this text from 1 Peter 3:3: \n“Blessed be God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. By his great \nmercy we have been born anew to a living hope through the \nresurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.” (Metaxas 2010: 528).\nWhat immediately strikes the observant reader is the easy and almost \nunproblematic way Bonhoeffer interchanges the terms God and Christ \nin these letters, suggesting that they signify the same divine reality. \nThis striking trend in Bonhoeffer’s almost childlike testimonies was of \n', '19Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\ncourse not accidental. In fact it represented a fundamental view on God \nand God’s dealings with our world, one which not only determined the \nunique character of his theological reflections, but also coloured the way he \nengaged with the church throughout his life.\nUnder the influence of Karl Barth’s dialectical theology, Bonhoeffer in his \nthoughts on God, from the outset embraced the apostolic testimony that \nthe God of Israel revealed Godself in the incarnated Logos that is in the \nlife, works and words of an ordinary Jewish man called Jesus of Nazareth \n(Pfeifer 1963:73-79). \n“All that we rightfully expect from God, or may ask from God, is to \nbe found in Jesus Christ.” (WE: 425). \nIn fact, in this Jesus’s life, according to Bonhoeffer, the mystery of God’s \ntranscendence offers itself no longer as a distanced and inaccessible reality, \nbut as a gift of ongoing and undeserved encounter. In the words of Pfeifer: \n“God’s transcendence, or better God’s extra me, is not to be \nunderstood in a far off transcendental way, but in a more \npersonalistic manner, that is in the encounter with our fellow being.” \n(Pfeifer 1963:82). \nThis belief was fundamental to Bonhoeffer’s understanding of God and \npersisted until the time of his imprisonment when he wrote: \n“Das Jenseitige ist nicht das unendliche Ferne, sondern das Nächste” \n– “That which is beyond is not at an infinite distance, but is that \nwhich is closest.” (WE:408).\nThe Jew, Jesus of Nazareth, who through his death and resurrection \nbecame for his followers the risen Lord, eventually was for Bonhoeffer the \nanswer to a lifelong longing that God should reveal himself more visibly \nand concretely in our bewildered world. According to Bonhoeffer – and \nthis he already spelled out in his earliest Christology lectures (GS III:166242)\n– Christ was, although hidden in human weakness, this visible face of \nGod, the presence of the divine Other, the vital encounter in our life. In the \nlife of Christ, God, so Bonhoeffer argued, is first of all revealed as a God \npro me, a God who sides with humankind as a loving and forgiving God, \n', '20 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nconstantly offering us the gift of justification, reconciliation and peace in \nand through Christ. \nAt the same time Christ for Bonhoeffer revealed God as a divine reality \nwho longed to enter and claim the very centre of our lives. It was specifically \nthis belief that triggered his resistance against any concept of God that \nrelegated God to the fringes of our life, either as a “God of gaps” or as an \n“emergency solution” in times of distress. His reluctance in prison to help \nthose in panic is explained by this conviction (WE:307). \nIndeed it is at the centre of our lives where the God in Christ exercises \nHis Lordship by saving and confirming our humanity, allowing us to be \nsecular, free and independent – living, similar to the suffering Christ, \nbefore God as if God was not there (WE:394-396). Here in solidarity with \nthe suffering Christ, those who follow God were are also challenged to seek \ntheir true humanity, not in the superficial offers and joys of life, but in \nthe sacrificial life of Christ, thereby becoming a church for others and a \ncredible witnesses to Jesus as Lord of all (WE:401-402). \nIt is especially at this junction where it becomes clear how Bonhoeffer, \nalthough still adhering to the confession of Chalcedon, eventually located \nthe central christological problem not primarily, like the classical tradition, \nin the relationship of God to Jesus, nor even of Jesus to the church, but in \nthe relationship of Jesus and the world (Philips 1967:83). \nThis then became the leading question as Bonhoeffer’s struggle with the \nchurch to be a credible witness to Christ intensified, namely, “Who is Christ \nfor us today?” (WE: 305). Or as it was posed earlier in the Ethics: “How can \nChrist become visibly embodied in the church as his body?” (Anthonissen \n152, 179). It was only when something of Christ starts shining through in \nthe life of the church that the church approaches its true identity. Because \nin the end Christ and Christ’s gracious identification with the church as his \nliving body is the only criterion and guarantee for its credibility. \nListening to how Bonhoeffer’s faith in Christ as the Lord and centre of life \ninformed and eventually determined his struggle to render the church \nmore credible, the question arises anew to what extent this apostolic \nfaith or confession still holds true for the church of today. Even more \n', '21Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nimportantly: Does it still have a central and determining influence on the \nlife and witness of the church today?\nSimilar to Bonhoeffer there are different voices today that challenge the \ntruth and validity of the traditional confession which regards Jesus as \nGod’s revelation to the world. From the side of the natural sciences we \nare almost daily confronted with new questions regarding the truth of the \nbiblical view on life, leading to new doubts about the existence of God as \ncreator and provider. \nBiblical scholars themselves are today raising new questions regarding the \nidentity of Christ and his claims to divinity. These questions of course can \nrarely be ignored by the church any more. When taken seriously they can \nhelp the church not only to sharpen its hermeneutical tools, but also, like \nwith Bonhoeffer, find fresh language with which to understand, translate \nand proclaim its message. \nHowever, it will be of great concern, especially with regard to the church’s \ncredibility in a modern age, if an inability – or even reluctance – to meet and \naddress these questions properly, will lead, on the one hand to an alienated \nfundamentalist response. Or even worse: if, on the other hand, it triggers \na process of self-secularization within the church which not only will lead \nmembers away from the revelatory truth regarding Christ, but also renders \nthe Bonhoefferian confession about Jesus superfluous and embarrassing. \nWithout underplaying the complexity and seriousness of the question, \nspecifically the confession regarding the divinity of Jesus Christ as Lord, \nwhich for Bonhoeffer throughout his life remained the vital criterion \nfor the credibility of the Church’s message and identity, I briefly want to \ndraw your attention to what can be called the debate about the so called \nsources that currently inform our choices regarding this very fundamental \ntheological issue. \nAlready Bonhoeffer in his early Christological lectures, by referring to the \nself-testimony of Jesus as the source of faith in his divine nature, had in his \nown way unmasked the inadequacy of the historical studies of his time to \npenetrate and reveal this mystery hidden in the life of the man Jesus. \nToday research has of course progressed much further, revealing new \nsources as well as fascinating outside Biblical analogies to the gospel stories \n', '22 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nand the apostolic tradition, specifically regarding the accounts about the \nbirth and resurrection of Christ. Although these studies do indeed shed \nnew light on the history and life of Christ, it remains a question whether \nthey, when weighed up against the older and more extensive gospel and \napostolic traditions, are adequate and convincing enough to totally \nrelativize or nullify the truth claimed by the gospels with regard to Jesus. \nOn a more personal note: Reading some of the newer studies, I have \ndiscovered that although many of the new research and their almost \nrevolutionary insights and claims, do resonate with my own curious \nand somewhat modern, critical mind, I have over the years felt myself \nincreasingly drawn and definitely more moved, inspired and consoled by \nthose who, like Bonhoeffer, had to wrench these truths from the proverbial \nfire, and then being so surprised and convinced by them, found themselves \nwilling to suffer and die for it. Such a raw existential struggle with the truth \njust rings much more true and credible than an exclusively theoretical and \nmore distanced involvement with the truth. \nIf we relate to this the question regarding the reasons for the dramatic \nchanges in the lives of those in the New Testament who confessed Jesus \nas Lord – and there are many – with Paul as a prime example – the issue \nbecomes even more fascinating. Because then we really need to look anew \nat the status and “truth-quality” of these testimonies. Granted, we are free \nto speculate from a more psychological or even sociological angle about \nwhat made someone like Paul make a 180-degree turn in his life, but it \nshould not make us so short-sighted, sceptical and even dishonest to ignore \nhis own version or testimony. \nThus we must be careful not to bypass or ignore the apostolic tradition, \nor even worse, to deal with it in such a selective way that we render it \ninsignificant. Apart from the fact that it still forms the bigger bulk of the \ntestimonies concerning the identity of Jesus, even allowing us to experience \nhis Lordship through many eyes, this was the tradition from which \nBonhoeffer drew his inspiration and courage. This was also the tradition \nin which he wanted to immerse the church, although in a new way, helping \nher to become a truthful witness to the living Christ – a church who is no \nlonger ashamed to live from the testimony of the apostles and in accordance \nwith them keeps confessing and proclaiming Christ as the centre and Lord \nof the universe.\n', '23Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\n(b) A church who dares, on behalf of the world, to be an alternative \ncommunity\nIt is a well-known fact how Bonhoeffer at an early stage of his life complained \nthat the invisibility of God was driving him crazy. He longed to know \nand even experience God’s involvement with our lives more directly and \nconcretely.\nPartly inspired by the liberal tradition’s wish to render the mystery of the \ndivine rationally more accessible – thereby making Christianity also more \nrelevant for a secular world – but at the same time also acknowledging \nthis tradition’s obvious limitations, Bonhoeffer eventually found the key \nto knowing God in Karl Barth’s scriptural viewpoint – a viewpoint that \nclaims that God had, before and also apart from any human initiative, \nintention or faculty, revealed Himself coming to us in the person of the Jew \nJesus of Nazareth (Anthonissen:116-118). \nUnlike Barth however it did not satisfy Bonhoeffer only to adhere to this \nso-called historical or temporal dimension of God’s revelation. Latching \non to Luther’s “finitum capax infiniti”- position, which in opposition to the \nextra-Calvinisticum principle, longed to vindicate for faith the possession \nof the divine, making it possible to have a more direct and clear grasp or \nhold on it, Bonhoeffer claimed and introduced what can be called a more \nspatial dimension for God’s revelation (De Gruchy 1972:107-108; Mayer \n1969:41)\nThat God’s revelation also included such a spatial dimension was due to \nthe fact that God’s freedom, according to Bonhoeffer was never meant only \nto be a freedom from people, but also a freedom for them – a freedom \nexpressed in God’s willingness to stand by us and to form a visible bond \nor covenant with people. In the end this is what makes God’s revelation \nhumanly more accessible and palpable (AS:85)\nAlthough Bonhoeffer was careful not to compromise God’s freedom and \nsovereignty in the way he depicted or described the space where God’s \nrevelation became visible, he was also quite ready to give the revelation a \nspecific form. Following from his belief that Christ was the kernel of God’s \nrevelation, the space where this revelation touched down and gained its \nvisible form was for him nothing else than the church as the body of Christ, \nthe concrete expression of God’s will for humankind (AS:112).\n', '24 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nAs such the church needed to express itself as a totally alternative and \nunique community, one which at the same time served as an archetype \nfor all true community. This according to Bonhoeffer was possible because \nChrist’s life, death and resurrection did not only signify a turn in history, \nbut a total change and transformation in the basic relationships which \npeople are supposed to have and maintain with one another (SC: 90-93). \nOn the basis of God’s conciliatory work through Christ, God’s spirit \nintegrates this Christ-deed into the church, rendering Christ present in \nthe form of community (“Christus als Gemeinde existierend”), thereby \ntransforming the lifestyle of the church in accordance with Jesus’s way of \nliving – that is into a life of loving communion for and with the other. In \nSanctorum Communio Bonhoeffer describes this Christ-like lifestyle in a \nmoving way showing how it expresses itself out in three distinctive ways: \nimmediate aid and help, intercessory prayer and the forgiveness of sins \n(SC:106-128).\nAccording to Renate Bethge it is quite possible that, apart from the biblical \npicture, Bonhoeffer’s family life, where he constantly experienced the \nvalue of mutual acceptance, care and love, may have (in an indirect and \nunconscious manner) contributed to his description of the church as a \ncommunity. In fact in Sanctorum Communio and Life together Bonhoeffer \ndescribes the family as the first and most intimate circle of community \n(Bethge 1987:1-23). \nWhatever the case may be, it is clear, that in accordance with Bonhoeffer’s \nbelief that all biblical concepts eventually have a social intention, \nencouraging us to follow in Jesus’s footsteps and into closer encounter \nand communion with our fellow believers, as well as with the suffering \nneighbour, the concept of community became for Bonhoeffer the main \ndescription and characteristic of a church that wanted to follow Christ and \nwitness to Him in a credible way.\nWhat this means is most clearly expressed by Bonhoeffer in his book Life \ntogether. In this powerful little book, which was the result of his own firsthand\nexperience of such an exercise, if not an experiment in community \nduring his Finkenwalde period, Bonhoeffer, after depicting the varied \ngifts of visible community, highlights one example of communal life as \nthe extraordinary, the “roses and the lilies” of the Christian life: when \n', '25Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nChristians commit themselves to live together in simplicity and sobriety, \nsharing their belongings like in the case of the first Christian communities \n(LT:11). \nIn the context of the community as a life together, a space is offered where \nthe old disciplines and practices of the Christian faith – disciplines like \ncommunal prayer and eating together, solitude and meditation, confession \nand intercession, singing and play – can be freely exercised. In this way \ndiscipleship, so Bonhoeffer believed, is expressed in its most unique form or \nhabitat. Even more importantly: a way of living is cultivated that can constantly\nnourish the faith of the community and help them to become more \nprepared and defensible in times of difficulty (Anthonissen 1993:74-80).\nTo a large extent this was the great value of the Finkenwalde period during \nwhich time Bonhoeffer, inspired by similar initiatives in England, set up \na house for the trainees for theological education. For Bonhoeffer the \ncommunity life practised there was based on the mores and guidelines \nof the Sermon on the Mount which became paradigmatic for the kind of \ndiscipleship that he believed Christ required from the church (Bethge: 335336)\n.\nCountering the criticism that Finkenwalde, by isolating itself temporarily \nfrom the direct heat of Hitler’s choking laws, had compromised its witness, \nDay writes:\n“Nothing less than living together, conviviality, sharing of resources \nand risk, common daily prayer and discipline and mundane cares, \n(all this) was necessary if the word of God was to be heard, obeyed \nand proclaimed in the land. That was Bonhoeffer’s conviction and \nhis experience during those years.” (Day 1975: 246-247).\nAs the political situation in Germany worsened, the Finkenwalde initiative \nand even the “Nachfolge” theology that inspired and supported it, although \nnever totally irrelevant for Bonhoeffer, retreated somewhat into the \nbackground. Bonhoeffer was now moved to more drastic action. Acting \nas a respected member of the Bonhoeffer -Dohnanyi circle, one of many \nsecret movements planning to overthrow Hitler’s regime – starting with \nthe elimination of the Führer himself – the question concerning Christ’s \npresence in the world and the ensuing role of the church as the body of \nChrist, now became more urgent for Bonhoeffer (Anthonissen: 90-98). \n', '26 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nThe view of the church which emerged for Bonhoeffer during this time was \nthat of a “community of responsibility” – a community which like Christ \nwas willing – in this case on behalf of the oppressed and the persecuted, \nthe majority being Jews – to oppose the powers and even to suffer on behalf \nof Christ. It was a community which was now also challenged to be more \nopen and inclusive, accommodating all those who were willing to struggle \nand uphold those human values which over centuries had formed the basis \nof Western civilization. \nIn this regard there was a specific event which not only moved Bonhoeffer \nto reconsider the nature and scope of Jesus’s Lordship, but also the witness \nand shape of a church or community which now stood up to follow Christ \nas Lord in a time of crisis. \nIn an essay called “Kirche und Welt” Bonhoeffer refers to this amazing \nexperience by recalling how many so-called humanists, in the hour of \ncrisis, experienced a new affinity for the church and specifically for the \ngospel. It was in particular the compassionate way of Christ, exemplified in \nthe life of many Christians, which drew them nearer. In a remarkable way \n– and this was how Bonhoeffer articulated it – the old humanitarian values \nlike truth, justice and freedom suddenly found a home with Christianity \nand especially within a church who faithfully adhered to the gospel \n(Anthonissen 1993:192). \nIn this way the biblical word from Mark 9:40 – “For he that is not against \nus, is for us” – in which Christ himself expanded the church beyond the \ncircle of disciples, fulfilled itself. Now the so-called “good person” who was \nprepared to suffer for justice, but did not openly confess the name of Jesus, \nalso enjoyed room and acceptance within the church as the visible body of \nChrist.\nThese thoughts were in a fascinating way further developed in Bonhoeffer’s \nfinal writings. In his Ethics, which partly reflects Bonhoeffer’s effort to \nclarify and even lay the moral foundations for a new societal order, the \nleading Christological question was about “Gestaltung” (Anthonissen \n1993:179) , that is: “How the reality of Christ as the ‘pantokrator’ was able \nto transform our life, culture and history” (Anthonissen 1993:181-182). \n', '27Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nWithin this context the church as God’s most important order or mandate \nwithin the structure of society represents that part of humanity where Christ \ninitially takes form, thereby serving as the first sign of a new humanity. \nAs such the church is called through its communal life, to exemplify the \nsuffering Christ’s inclusive and sacrificial love, thus reminding the world \nof its destination (Anthonissen 1993:195). To express the unique character \nof the church as an alternative and completely inclusive community \nBonhoeffer introduced the term “Gemeinwesen” (Day 1975:368-369). \nIn this “Gemeinwesen” or convivial togetherness, being a Christian and \nbeing human come together. The church becomes a space where human \nbeings reach out to each other like Christ, caring and even suffering for \none another. In alliance with each other they may now also enjoy play and \nfriendship, thereby celebrating the resurrection of Christ.\nIn his Letters and Papers from Prison where Bonhoeffer was reflecting \non the conditions for and especially on the form of the Christian faith \nin a modern secularized society, he took his reflections on the credible \nwitness of the church as a unique and alternative community even further. \nAnswering the leading Christological question of the time: “Who is Christ \nfor us today?” he proposes that the meaning of Christ for us today only \nbecomes clear where the church, like Christ becomes a community which \nis there for the other, prepared to live without privileges and even to suffer \nfor and on behalf of those who suffer, in this case the Jews. That is the place \nwhere the church as the body of Christ needs to be. In fact Bonhoeffer in \nThomas Day’s words, proposed:\n“The body of Christ as including all of humanity, a place where \npeople of all tongues would find some common language so that all \nbe understood. As the heart of human sympathy the church would \nbe the starting point to winning free space in the world for art and \neducation, for free friendship, play, the whole of what Kierkegaard \ncalled ‘aesthetic existence’, a place where everything serves the \ncommunity and community serves others.” (Day 1975:466-467).\nReflecting on the relevance of Bonhoeffer’s ecclesiology and especially the \nongoing challenge it entails for the church to become more credible, his \nnotion of the church as an alternative community remains without doubt \none of his most potent and valuable legacies. Thomas Day expressed the \n', '28 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nimportance of this (basic notion and) thrust in Bonhoeffer’s theology best \nwhen he wrote: \n“Bonhoeffer’s writings are there to remind us that Christ is not about \nbuilding successful religious organizations, but informing human \ncommunity among the poor and the suffering of the world; and \nthat faith in Jesus’ God means full, active commitment in human \nsolidarity (Day 1975:461).\nIt is no surprise that this particular focus on true community as the vital \nkey, if not the crucial prerequisite for a more credible life and witness of \nthe church in the world, has inspired many to explore and test Bonhoeffer’s \nsuggestions. They have rightfully recognized that community not only \nexpresses the heart of what a truthful church is all about, but also the place \nto which the gospel wants to constantly lead us – and that for the sake of a \nmore just and humane world. \nIn the words of the Franciscan writer Richard Rohr: \n“There is no other form of Christian life except a common one…\nUntil and unless Christ is someone happening between people, \nthe gospel remains largely an abstraction.” (Rohr 1993:50). This of \ncourse latches on to Bonhoeffer’s own observation: “Christ in one’s \nown heart is weaker than the Christ in the word of his brother.”  \n(LT 1963:13).\nBonhoeffer’s concept of the church as community first of all reminds us \nthat a church which is only geared to serve the so-called eternal needs of \nthe individual can miss and even distort its real purpose. Writing in an \nextremely helpful way Richard Rohr gives interesting insight in what this \ndistortion is and why it happened:\n“We are now paying the price of centuries of which the church \nwas narrowed from a full vision of peoplehood to an almost total \npreoccupation with private persons and their devotional needs. \nBut history has shown that individuals who are confirmed in their \nindividualism by the very character of our evangelism will never \ncreate church, except after the model of a service station: they will \nuse it as a commodity like everything else…We are saving souls \nwhile God is creating people” (Rohr 1993:50-51).\n', '29Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nFurther on he writes: \n“If the community model of church has seldom taken hold, \nit can probably be attributed to many causes: individualism, \nauthoritarianism, clericalism, fear, plus an overly intellectualized \ncommunication of the gospel. But the cause that I want to deal with \nis a certain kind of apathy, a fear of passion” (Rohr 1993:50-51).\nRohr’s remark, apart from offering an interesting historical analysis, also \ndraws our attention to the positive challenge that Bonhoeffer’s concept \nof the church as an alternative community offers us. This challenge is to \nbecome and at the same time offer a space where people from all walks \nof life, including Christians from different countries, traditions, cultures, \nsexes, classes and races can come together to really meet and serve each \nother. \nOf what can happen where people are drawn into real community and have \nan honest encounter with one another, Rohr writes grippingly:\n“One of the hopeful signs of a familial church community is that \nthe issues that we struggle with – love, sexuality, guilt, doubt, \nfrustration, disillusionment etc. – have a safe environment where \nthey can be dealt with openly. Here it is OK to show affection…It is \nacceptable to feel here, and you do not have to be ashamed or afraid. \n(Rohr 1993:51-52).\n“The spiritual family of the church has the right theory, but lacks \nthe practice, experience and lifestyle setting. We need quite simply \nplaces of sharing where the Word can be shared, and where hearts \nand bread can be broken and passed around…If the church is to be \nrenewed, if family is to happen anywhere, we must again make it \npossible for heart to speak to heart” (Rohr 1993:51-52).\n(c) A church that keeps a delicate balance between solidarity and \nsilence, between the search for justice and the necessity to pray \nFor Bonhoeffer a church that risks following the incarnated Christ can \nnever retreat into a ghetto, but is from the outset, exactly like her Lord, \ndirected towards and involved in the world. The church is not only an end \nin itself, but also a means to an end.\n', '30 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nThe theological basis and impulse for this involvement was for Bonhoeffer \nthroughout his life informed and guided by the notion of life orders, or as \nthey were later called and explained in his Ethics, as “divine mandates”. \nThese mandates which consist of the church, marriage and family, culture \nand the state were to Bonhoeffer’s mind life forms created by God. \nBy existing and functioning together in harmony, interacting in a \ncordial and healthy way, these mandates express the will of God, thereby \nguaranteeing the necessary peace and justice society so desperately \nneeds. However, when one of these mandates, like in the time of Hitler’s \ntotalitarian state, oversteps its boundaries and claims the dominant place \nin this delicate network, it not only disturbs the God- given order in society, \nbut also starts to erode the moral fibre and crucial human values that are so \nvital for the wellbeing, harmony and happiness of a society (Anthonissen \n1993:187-188). \nThen the time has arrived, according to Bonhoeffer, for the church as God’s \nmost important mandate to step in and to testify to God’s will. Bonhoeffer \ndid not believe that it was the church’s first calling to provide a recipe \ndevised to solve the problems of the world. No, the church needed under \nall circumstances to remain a credible witness to its Lord by simply staying \ntrue to its own unique identity as the body of Christ, believing that the \nunique form of community that it represented and embodied – that is a \ncommunity of reconciliation, love and forgiveness – is not only an image of \na new humanity, but a first sign of God’s love for all humanity, the crucial \nreminder of society’s real purpose and destination (Huber 1985:199). \nBeing a sign or image of God’s love of course does not exclude the \ncourageous and prophetic proclamation of God’s word but actually calls \nfor it. In fact the word of God and the authority of the preacher, is seen by \nBonhoeffer as a vital key to and source of the church’s ongoing existence, \nwhile the unique form of the church is the visible expression of the effect \nand influence of God’s word in the church’s life. In this way the church \nbecomes the place of Christ’s presence. \nTo express the importance and urgency of this challenge to continuously \nand bravely witness to the world, not only by speaking a prophetic word \nthrough preaching, but also by appealing to the world through the way \nin which the church exists, Bonhoeffer coined the almost provocative \n', '31Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nphrase, that the church should heed to the commandment of the hour. This \nchallenge was not only put to the local church, but also to the ecumenical \nchurch (Anthonissen 1993:108-115).\nAs the situation in Germany worsened and the pressure on the church to \nconform grew, Bonhoeffer’s view of the manner in which the church should \ninvolve and address the challenge of the hour also changed. Whereas in \nearlier years the prophetic witness which Bonhoeffer expected of the church \nwas to prepare a way for the word of God to be heard more clearly, (allowing \nfor the church to engage more cordially and patiently with the state), his \nexpectation at a later stage changed. In his Ethics and his Letters from \nPrison, he for instance suggested a more drastic, open and confrontational \ncharacter, expressed specifically by the word “responsibility” (Anthonissen \n1993:149-207).\nIn a way the notion of “responsibility” characterizes Bonhoeffer’s conviction \nof this ongoing obligation of the church to bravely render its witness to the \nworld. As Bonhoeffer’s reflections on Christ’s place and work in the world \ndeveloped this responsibility became more urgent. It included not only \nofficial members of the church, but all those who were prepared to suffer \nfor the oppressed.\nListening to this presentation one can easily get the impression that \nBonhoeffer was primarily a social activist, whose main interest was the \nchurch’s ongoing involvement with the issues of society; that his effort to \nrender the community credible, was geared only to witness in public. Of \ncourse this is only partly true. For Bonhoeffer there was also a mystical \ncore at the centre of his own life and also at the heart of the church as the \nbody of Christ, which not only served as a nourishing source for himself \nand the life of the community, but also for its testimony in the world. \nIt is the space where Christ himself enters the heart of his followers through \nhis Word and Spirit and where the church – by practising amongst other \nthings the disciplines of solitude, silent contemplation, prayer, meditation \nand confession – is able to receive and be consoled, and yes, even changed \nby the gift of God’s love and grace.\n', '32 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nHow this spiritual gift should be received, embraced and nurtured is \nwonderfully expressed by Bonhoeffer in one of his last letters to Bethge on \n21 August 1944:\n“We should allow ourselves again in a quiet and unhurried way, and \nfor longer times, to become totally engrossed in the life, words, acts, \nsuffering and death of Jesus to really discover and see what God has \npromised and made true.” (WE:425). \nThis more contemplative spirituality and pious commitment to Christ, was \nan indispensable part of Bonhoeffer’s life. Not only did this commitment, \nshortly after his return from America, change his life and moved him \nduring his time as a lecturer and pastor in Berlin to confront some of his \nstudents with the very personal question whether they loved Jesus – it is \nalso well known how he nurtured this relationship with the living Christ \nhimself through the regular practice of reading the Bible and prayer \n(Bethge 1985: 154-155). \nA vital part of the training of students in Finkenwalde within the \nrelatively isolated context of community, was also the practising of these \nold disciplines, helping the Confessing Church at that time to be more \nprepared and defensible against the looming crises (GS I:42; GS II:285). \nEven after Finkenwalde had to be shut down Bonhoeffer received letters \nfrom Finkenwalde students, thanking him for introducing them to the \ndiscipline of meditation (Bethge 1985:607).\nIn prison Bonhoeffer maintained the daily discipline of Scripture \nmeditation and prayer he had been practicing for more than a decade. Each \nmorning he meditated for at least half an hour on a verse of Scripture. He \nalso interceded for his friends and relatives, and for his brothers in the \nConfessing Church who were serving on the front. In one of his last letters \nto Bethge Bonhoeffer shares how he meditated on the Moravian daily \nreadings (“Losungen”), remarking that all boils down to being in Him, \nChrist (Bethge 1985:425). \nBut for Bonhoeffer the practice of these disciplines was not only a personal \nnecessity, it was also an unfailing condition for a credible and meaningful \ntestimony of the church in the world. For it is only when God is allowed to \nserve his followers in spaces of silence and prayerful expectation with his \n', '33Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nlove, that their words and witness will also have power and meaning. That \nis why the so called cultus or inner life of the church is always extremely \nimportant for Bonhoeffer, also when suggests that the church has to \ninterpret and live the gospel in a new non-religious way. \nWhat that would entail was never properly spelled out by Bonhoeffer, but \nhe did give a clue by referring to the importance of the so-called disciplina \narcana (Anthonissen 1993:232-240). The disciplina arcana encompassed \nthose disciplines which from earlier ages formed the sacred heart of the \nchurch’s existence. They were vital in protecting the church from rendering \nits message profane and impious.\nIt is necessary to remind ourselves as believers of the importance and \nnecessity to always in the way we live and testify to our faith, retain this \nbalance between solidarity and silence, between social involvement and \nprayer? Concerning this I want to highlight just one more aspect of this \nchallenge – an aspect that Bonhoeffer himself stressed during his time at \nFinkenwalde – and which concerns the issue of theological training. \nShortly before his return from London to take up the position as Director \nfor Theological Training in Finkenwalde, he wrote to Erwin Sutz:\n“The whole training of a next generation of young theologians need \ntoday to be undertaken in a church-monastic related environment or \nschools (kirchlich-klösterliche Schulen) in which the true doctrine \nor teaching, the Sermon on the Mount and the Christian worship \nshould be taken seriously. In the case of all three these things this is \ncurrently not happening at the University” (GS I:42). \nLater on 19 September 1936, after Bonhoeffer had already practised \ntheology in the context of a caring community in Finkenwalde, he shared \nhis conviction in this regard with Karl Barth:\n“I am firmly convinced that with regard to what is expected from \nour young theologians today in terms of their responsibilities, both \nin what they bring along from the University, as well as their work \nin the congregation – especially here in the Eastern part – we need \na totally different model of education, one which for sure belongs in \nsuch a community-orientated seminary…That both our theological \nwork, as well as a real caring and pastorally-inclined community \n', '34 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\ncan only grow in a kind of life together which is determined by \nregular morning and evening gatherings around the Word, and by \nestablished times for prayer, is for sure” (GS II:285). \nFinally, in a letter to his brother Karl-Friedrich during this time, it becomes \nclear how he visualised the renewal of the church:\n“The restoration of the church comes from a new kind of monasticism,\none which only has this in common with a previous tradition: \nthe uncompromising way of life in accordance with the Sermon on \nthe Mount and following in the footsteps of Jesus” (GS III:25).\nThese thoughts seem to me to be of extreme importance for the training \nof a next generation of pastors and theologians in our own context. In \nthis regard I finally want to share a story, if not a keen observation, which \nto my mind highlights some of the problems as well as some of the main \nchallenges we face in this regard. \nAccording to a former student of this faculty, who in the meantime has \nbecome a lecturer at another University, most students when they come \nto study theology are usually quite pious and naive. In fact it is exactly \nbecause of this piety, which mostly implies a strong sense of vocation that \nthey come to study theology. \nHowever, during the course of their training they are inevitably exposed \nto the newer critical, historical and hermeneutical research and discourses \nwhich for many are a positive, liberating and enlightening experience, \nbroadening their horizon and also stimulating a more rational engagement \nwith the traditional concepts of their faith, often making them leave behind \nmany of these concepts and the practices related to them. \nFor others, however, this introduction into the more critical tradition, is \nperceived as an erosion and even, in some cases, an undermining of their \ntraditional piety and faith, leaving them with nagging doubt, growing \nconfusion and even outright resistance or indifferent cynicism.\nIn both cases a glaring spiritual vacuum often remains, one which, \naccording to my colleague, requires a spirituality which can, on the one \nside help the more critically minded students to regain a so-called “second \nnaivety”, not forgetting or neglecting the disciplines of prayer, silence, \n', '35Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nmeditation and even fasting. On the other hand such a spirituality needs \nto restore new confidence in the authority of Scriptures for those who have \nbecome disillusioned while guarding at the same time against the dangers \nof fundamentalism and self-complacency. \nIt would not be out of place to think of Bonhoeffer’s suggestions in this \nregard – suggestions which in short amount to a critical revision of our \ncurrent model of theological training, undergirding and complementing \nit with a tested spirituality which should be practiced and appropriated \nwithin the context of a nourishing and caring community. The vital \ningredients of this spirituality should be those which over the centuries \nhave proved themselves to provide the so-called “spiritual armour” \nreferred to in Ephesians 6. This armour has rendered most of the apostles \nfireproof in difficult situations. And putting on this armour has in the older \nchurch, similarly to what Bonhoeffer proposed, often been associated with \nthe practices of silence/ silent contemplation, solitude, prayerful reading of \nthe Bible, meditation and especially spiritual direction or accompaniment \n– all geared to help people, and in this case theological students and future \nministers to cope with life’s challenges and difficulties in a more hopeful \nand meaningful way. \nOn a personal note: I was glad to hear that since professor Denise Ackermann \nwas appointed within the Department of Practical Theology a few years \nago to assist with spiritual formation in the Faculty of Theology that the \nteaching and practising of some of these disciplines, including an annual \nretreat, were integrated into the curriculum. My impression, however, also \non the basis of discussions with Prof. Ackermann, was that these exercises \nor practices, and in particular the possibility of a retreat, were usually only \nintroduced at the end of the training, serving as a finishing touch. The \nquestion remains whether the guidance into these exercises or disciplines \nshould not have been introduced earlier, thus forming a more integral part \nof the whole training? Perhaps the more vital question is whether those \nwho are responsible for the training are themselves also committed to the \npractising of these disciplines? \n', '36 Anthonissen  •  STJ 2016, Vol 2, No 2, 13–38\nBibliography\nAnthonissen, CA 1993.
