Nearly every road to this, city has been materially improved, during the past two or three years,, and since Alexandria has annexed, outlying territory formerly portions, of Alexandria and rah fax counties,, \';e improvements have been greati, \' y accelerated, and the good work is, 11 being pushed with vigor., Since the advent of the automobile, ,, fV> goods road fever has spread all, over Virginia. Alexandria is in the, natural neck of travel by rail <>r auto, to the southern portion uf the United, States. During the past half a con, \'CUl\'y puujic <iuv:upia uii>t m n.\'ii.., been made to divert traffic in other, directions, out proposed bridges, across the Potomac, lines via Georgetown, and elsewhere have proved impractical., and in 1901 .the Pennsylvania, Railroad Company spent millions, of dollars in constructing a new, road from Alexandria to Washington,, thereby submitting to the inevitable., Keeping pace with the- progress of, its people in all the branches of industry, and answering the demands of, the time for adequate facilities for, improved methods of transportation., Virginia, during the\' ten years since, the organization of the State Highway, Department for the concc-r.tralion, of effort in perfecting, a system,, of modern roads through the Slate,, has made wonderful strides in the, building of public highways tkrough., out the length anil breadth of the, Commonwealth., From a modest beginning in the, year 1907, when there were constructed, under ihc supervision of the de., . heat twonty-four .miles of im/, . d roads, the Slate\'s activities, iW i ; . broadened from year to yecar,, mow, liistoric Virginia is tra?, i- - versed by a network of modern highways,, reaching a total mileage of, over o,000. and connecting, in some, degrees, practically every section of, |v. " the State each to .each., With the "coming of good roads,, ? conditions in the State have been rendu, lionized.

Our own city has, |t t een brought nearer to the outlying, districts. changing the whole aspect, I of economic life., The wish of a few for? arc-looking, Virginians, translated into action four, Vcitts ago by the organbauion of an, association with that end in view, for, a thoroughly modern, durable stretch, cf tjrtvcway between K\\hmbnd .Vand, the-, national capital v.ilt he rejdi^ed, vh .January 1.

Thei, commissioner got Ike number of the, car and has revoked the reciprocal, rights of the owner to operate a car, through New Jersey., People who own automobiles, asi, I well as al] wel\'-disp <sc.J people are, i not likely to express sympathy for, the Virginians who received but part, ; of what they deserved. Placing of, | tacks, broken bottles, bale wirt. ana, {other menaces to rubber tires in, I streets or roads is a mean procedure., j?and those upon who such acts are^, ] proven should receive the full pen-,, alty of the law., Such practices arc often noticed, in Alexandria and on roads leading, to our city. The manner in which, glass is placed in position shows, such acts of vandalism are works of, malicious persons who rejoice at the, discomfiture of others., Broken bottles, partly hidden in the,, dust at the edges of roads-are oc-., casionallv discovered. Such menace?!, arc intended for automobiles which\', may bo compelled to take the fringe, of a highway in order to pa^s oncoming, machines., Broken glass, bottles arc seen ir, the city streets daiiv. That they arc, thrown there for a purpose is apparI, cnt. It is hoped the policemen will, soon arraign seme of the miscreant?, in order that the full extent of the, law may be mstcd out to them., AFFECTING THOSE AFAR, I \' There is no telling what is radiating, from the recent revival services; in, Alexandria.
