Not all rich men\n^ave secured their money by un\nfair means or inhumane methods,\nand it is unfair to place on all rich\nmen the stigma which belongs to\nthose who are rich by dishonest\nmeans.\nCertain classes and individuals\njudge all by the few, and this is as\nanjnst as it is untrue.\nEvery man should be given the\nbenefit of the doubt until he is\nproved guilty, and if you do not\npersonally know and can prove\nthat a man has secured bis money\nby dsihonestly you are manifestly\nuufair to even intimate anything\nof the sort.

A number of State\nagricultural colleges are now ar\nranging, in co operation with the\ndepartment, baby beef shows and\ncontests to be held in the fall, This\nmovement originated in Texas*\nwhere it has proved so successful\nthat the Texas Baby Beef Club\nnow has a membership of more\nthan 1,200.\nThis pioneer club was organiz\ned to encourage the fattening of\nmore cattle in Texas. For many\nyears Texs had raised feeder cattle\nbut instead of fattening them on\nhome-grown milo, kafir, and fete\nrita, the farmers of the State had\nsent them to the feed lots of the\noorn belt. This, it was felt, was a\nmistake. By the efficient use of\neconomical feed to produce rapid\ngains in weight and by pushing\nhigh-grade oalves without loss of\nmilk fat into highly fiuished, ma\nturely formed yearliugs, known as\nbaby beeves, it was believed that\nprofitable returns could be secured\nto Texas cattle feeders.\nIn order to popularize the pro\nduction of baby beef, therefore, a\nprominent breeder in Coleman\nCounty started a baby beef contest\namong the farm boys. The boys\npurchased their calvts by giving\nnotes payable when the calve were\nmarketed as baby beef. The idea\nproved successful trim the tiiBt\nand the Annual Boys’ Encamp\nment and Baby Beef Contest, held\nat Fort worth, under the auspices\nof the Natioual Feeders’ and Breed\nera’ Show has increased each year\nin attendance and exhibits. Last\nMarch BOO boy feeders of pigs and\nbaby beeves gathered to receive\ninstruction and to show their stock.\nOver 100 well-finished baby beeves\nof excellent type were exhibited.\nIn a number of the classes the\nboys competed with their calves\nagainst older and more experienced\nfeeders. Twenty ribbons were\nwon in these classes by club mem\nbers. Three brothers from Clay\nCounty won two firsts and two sec\nonds, and one of these brothers al\nso obtained the grand champion\nship in the competition among', 'Announcements\nFor Congress Fourth District\nHON.

On ac\ncount of the recent bad weather\nmany people failed to attend, who\notherwise would 1 ave gone, but a\nlarge crowd was present and enjoy\ned the day.

There is no race surge, no\nrace hunger for the lands of other\npeoples; there is no lust for over\nseas expansion as an outlet for an\novercrowded population at home.\n;; There is no such thing as race ha\ntred among the people. This is\nfiction of the press, of foreign min\nisters, of the war classes.\nPeople do not want war.
