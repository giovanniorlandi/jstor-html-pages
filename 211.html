He received permission from the General to beat a march,\ninto which ho threw his very soul. The tired, weary, almost de\nfeated soldiers caught the inspiration of tho charge, and with new\nenergy and quickened fire of body and spirit rushed once more to\nthe battlo and won a great victory.\nTho people of this country feel that they have been almost de\nfeated; discouragement fills their minds\' and hearts. The power of\nthe enemy has alradst reached the limit of their endurance. They\nhave been bqating a retreat, but the time has come to beat a march\nand catch that new inspiration which Napoleon\'s soldiers felt at\nthe stirring music brought forth by the indomitable drummer boy\nwho knew hot how to bent a retreat.\nEvery man who is pessimistic, or who permits the discourage\nments of the hour to dominate him, is beating a retreat He-is not\nonly beaming a retreat for his own business, but he is beating a re\ntreat for all with whom ho eomps in touch. The time has come to\nbeat a march, to sound the charge, to quicken the life blood of the\nnation once more, and out of the apparent defeat of the last twelve\nmonths rally for a new. charge, a new creative period of work and\nenergy. Forgetting the things that arc behind, -we must press for\nward witlugreater energy to overcome tlm difficulties which as ,a\nnation we have had to face.\nEveryMman who draws within nis business shell, every man\nwho cancels his contracts or pecaimiotically refuses to do business\nbecause of his fear of the futtu, is oeating a retreat.\nEveryMman who goes nhcad, who has the optimism of the drum\nmer boy and a spirit which dares to do things, is beating a march\non to victory.\n, If throughout the entire nation there can be rekindled the drum\nmer boy\'s fire, we shnll soou navo optimism and sunshine and pros\nperity, where today there is pessimism and doubt and despair.\nIt was the drummer boy whose work inspired the great Na\npoleon and his troops. It must be the drummer boy of the business\nworld, the farmer and the small merchant, and the individual busi\nness man, who beats the march and sounds the charge rather than\nthe great business leaders who have halted so long.\nThe ones who have suffered must be the ones to dare and do\ntho most.\nThe men who would beat a march on to victory over the threat\nened disaster which they have so long faced will be the red-blooded\nmen who know that the nation cannot stand still and who are de\ntermined to( lead the charge.\nThe pessimist is the shirker.\nThe optimist is the burden-bearer. -\nThe pessimist is the man who beats the retreat..\nThe optimist is the man who sounds the charge.\nWHICH ARE YOUt\n- Manufacturer\'s Record.\nCommunity Service\nFor,Mt.

When lime is\nprovided the crop will grow luxur\niously in gullies and will even do well\non very wet land.\nOn wet land near Berea a piece\nof ground that was limed and treat\ned with acid phosphate made an\nenormous crop of sweet clover and\nproduced a good crop of corn the\nfollowing year. After 275 pounds\nof seed had been harvsted from each\nacre the straw was plowed under.\nThe next year this same piece of\nground produced 40 bushels of corn\nper acre as compared with 20 hush\nels on similar soil that had not been\ntreated.\nIn western Shelby county 25 tons\nof alfalfa hay from nine cuttings in\nthree years were obtained on ground\nwhere a crop of sweet clover had\nbeen turned under,\nExperiments conducted by the\nKentucky Agricultural Experiment\nStation show that sweet clover may\nbe grown fairly well with as little\nas 500 pounds of ground limestone,\nor 250 pounds of burned lime per\naero although the growth is not as\nlarge as with heavier applications\nnor the effects as lasting.

Sunday School\n(By Edna Dean Baker)\nIn this day of lowered standards\nof prevalent crime, of vicious forms\nof entertainments of which the aver\nago movie is a type, wo need to sub\nject our childrn to overy uplifting\ninfluence that makes for clean, hon\nest, strong character. We need to\nseek a permanent remedy for self\nishness which is causing the strife\nbetween labor and capital as well as\nall other strife. The Sunday School\nis one medium for this valuable\ntraining.\nIn many homes there comes a day\nwhen the question "Shall Joseph go\nto Sunday SchoolT" is raised in all\nseriousness by Joseph\'s parents. Per\nhaps they themselves are members\nof a church, perhaps they aro not\neven church attendants. There Is,\nhowever, a desire on tho part of all\ngenuinely earnest fathers and moth\ners to secure for their children not\nonly the best in education, hut what\never blessing tho church may havo\nto bestow. Thoy often express this\nambition as did one little mother\nwhen she brought her Joseph to Sun\nday School, "I want my boy to be a\ngood boy," she said.\nWhile going to Sunday School Is\nnot synonymous with being "a good\nboy" any more than going to church\ninsures honesty in business, yet the\nchurch has boen and is a fundamen\ntal agency in creating the ideals,\nthe aspirations, the attitudes that\nservo as the motive power for right\naction. The Bible story is a potent\nfactor to this end. Theodore who\nhad listened eagerly to tho story of\nDavid and Goliath told by a Sunday\nSchool teacher who was an artist in\nmaking this old story live in the im\nagination, remarked, "Gee but that\nDavid was a wiz 1" and then wistful\nly, "Do you s\'pose I could over be\nlike him?"\nNot alone tho creating of ideas of\nservice but tho carrying out of such\nideas is a prominent feature of Sun\nday School work today.

They longed\nto help and decided to solicit dough\nnuts, cookies and canned fruit from\ntheir mothers. They held n sale with\nthe aid of the Sunday School teach\ner and realized sixty dollars with\nwhich to support starving children.\nThe teaching of the Sunday School\nis not restricted to establishing a\nright relation to one\'s fellows but it\nincludes acquainting the child with\nGod as the Creator of all things thus\nanswering the eternal question of\nGeiiesis satisfactorily. It also in\ncludes the presentation of God as\nthe Greater Father and hence the\nfriend, protector and guide of every\nchild. "Thank you, God," said a\ntiny child, "for keeping care of me."\nThe atmosphere of reverence and de\nvotion makes a deep impression up\non the child. John\'s father, a man\nwho never attended any church, con\nsented to his boy\'s attendance at\nSunday School. One morning a few\nweeks after John had entered the\nSundny School, the father became\nirritated at a refractory collar but\nton and "took the name of the Lord\nin vain." John who apparently had\nbeen asleep, sat up and in a tone of\ngrieved reproof said, "Daddy, if you\nwent to our Sunday School you\nwouldn\'t speak of God liko that."\n"Shall Joseph go to Sunday\nEAGLE "MIKADO"-\nFor Sale at your Dealer Made in fire trades\nASK FOR THE YELLOW PENCIL WITH THE RED BAND\nv EAGLE MIKADO\nEAGLE PENCIL COMPANY, NEW YORK\nHave Us Call\nFor Your Things Today.\'.\nWE DRY-CLEAN\nThe Modern Way\nSTOCKTON\'S ELECTRIC DRY CLEANING CO.\nMt.

Valloau, plant pathologist of the\nCollege of Agriculture, and which\nhaB just come off tho press. These\ndiseases were wildfire, angular leaf\'\nspot and a disease not so well rec\nognized, which Dr. Valleau calls mo\nsaic speck spot) Greatest damage\nwa3 caused by the first two dis\neases, while the third was of com\nparatively little importance, accord\ning to the circular.\nWildfire caused serious injury in\nthe seed beds during thepast season,\nappearing about Mays 15, s and con\ntinuing to do serious damage for\nabout two weeks. Further trouble\nwas not reported until the middlo of\nJuly, about ono week after a severe\nrain and wind storm. At that timo\nwildfire and angular leaf-spot both\ncaused heavy losses in several fields\nin which tho tobacco was making a\nvery rapid growth. Practically no\ninjury was caused on small tobacco\nnt this time.\nIn August, following a rainy\nperiod, both diseases spread rapidly\nand caused serious losses throughout\ntho Burley section, tho circular\nstates. In the latter part of August\nthe diseases spread rapidly in the\ndark tobacco section. From \'this time\non they continued to cause serious\nlosses following every rain storm\nwhere wind was present. ,\nAs far as could be learned in in\nvestigations conducted by Dr. Val\nleau, wildfire first appeared as a\nserious disease in the Burley district\nin 1920. Angular leaf-spot appear\ned to be quite well known to many\ngrowers who called it "rust."
