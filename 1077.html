The, association of steamship men met in, Seattle Friday morning and continued, in uninterrupted conference until near, ly 6 o\'clock. Adjournment was then, taken until 8 o\'clock in the evening., On reassembling after dinnrr the dis, cussion was resumed and no conclusion, was reached up to the time the steamer, tailed, which was about It o\'clock. The, agents of the interested companies in, this city received no instructions as, to whether thrro was any prospect of, a settlement being reached. In fact, thry got no advices or directions., It is quite certain the bone of con, tention is that the \'Pacific Coast Steam, ship Company is demanding that the, Washington & Alaska Steamship Com, pany cease to have its hoats call at, Vancouver and will accept no other, solution of the vexed problem. This, comes from a source which is reliable,, and is as authentic as it could be with, out bring directly from one of those, participating in thr conference., The failure of the companies below, to send any news as to how the con, flict is progressing to their agents here, is capable of several constructions. It, may mran that an adjustment was near, at hand and that nothing would V sent, up hrrr until it was effected, and then, thr agents will be simply notified of the, results. !t may also mean that the, nrospects of the settlement are remote, and that the companies deemed it best, not to inform the representatives here, and to leave them untrammelled to, make the most of a bad situation. Or, it it may mean that no material change, lias occurred and all these meetings, ire mrrrly for the purpose of manuev, ring to get some advantageous post, lion., The latter is probably the correct in, lerpretation. One of the agents in dis, cussing the matter last evening said:, "I do not bcliele any material head, way has been made, for if such were, the case some of us at least would have, been advised. If an agreement wen, near at hand we would have been noti, fied so as to protect our companies on, south bound passengers at the ear, liest opportunity. It seems to me also, if the situation is hopeless, we at this, end would have been instructed to cut, the rate below any which hail yet been, quoted? so low in fact that the com, panies would loose money and then the, issue would be forced and then a re, sult satisfactory to the majority reach, ed speedily., The present figures are what wc call, living rates? the companies can make, expenses at them? and with the in, creased travel in sight can keep things, going this way #11 summer. When it, is decided to fight in earnest you vill, see rates go down so that the operators, loose money and then it will be a ques, tion of the one which can hold out the, longest.", The situation today is much the same, as it was previous to the arrival of the, Cottage City, except news that the, -ompanies are still trying to get to, gether was received. Nothing further, vill be known until the Victorian ar, ives. which will be this evening or, "riday forenoon. Unless the associa, on came to a conclusion at the night, i-ssion it is improbable that anythii.g, of importance will come then, for meet, ings have been held only one: a week., The Cottage City took passengers at, the rates estabished in the first few, days of the war? $10 first-class ami, sccond-class. These prices will be held, to until a change is reported from be, low. The l-\'arallon, which is expect, ed to sail some time today will make, the same rate., THEY MADE MERRY, . AI EESEAt BOARD, Jood Things For Both Mind and Body Were Lavishly Dis, pensed Af the Y. M. (\'. A. l\'aixinet Last Night, The li.ini|urt Riven at the Y. M. C. A., ist nielli was a fca>t of good things, ml one at which there was a stead), dw of wit and an abundance of ;n, tructive toasts. The gymnasium was, -onverted into a banquet hall and three, jr?e tables with covers for sixty, ooked temptingly arranged for the ex, tectant guests. It was just about If, ?\'clock when the association orchestra, omposed of Messrs. Wall. Stokis., ihoemake and Swadling. and Miss, r\'tossic Root opened the evening\'s ies, ivities with a well merited selection, .vhile the guests gathered around ready, or the spread. Itcii\\g seated, eight of, skagway\'s prettiest misses entered the, ?all with servers on which was the, irst course. From then on through, he \'seven courses there was a clatter, if merry tongues and a clattre of dish, ?s both K>viiiK evidence of the good, .iinc being had. During the banquet, nusic was furnished by the orchestra, in an excellent manner., I;or an hour the delicate viands held, full sway. Then the literary part of the, ban<|uet commenced., Dr. M. F. Mall acted as toastmastcr., lie was a good one and sat the bah, of humor a rolling in a manner thai, was catching. He dwelt briefly on the, occasion .explaining the why and, wherefore and then introduced Rev., G. S. Clevinger. who responded to the, toast "Good Diggings." The speaker, told a new story and deftly applied it, to the occasion then drifted into, treasured diggings. He said that out, side of the literal meaning of good dig, gings as was meant in the northern, country, there were diggings far better,, more valuable and richer than could be, found in earthly districts. He referred, to the spiritual diggings and the end, of all. the final clean. up of life. With, a word on the work of the association, and its attainments he brought an in, teresting toast to an end amidst ap, plause., The toastmaster introduced E. A., Friend. who had for a tost "Checha, cos." Mr. Friend with the remark, that a better subject for the subject, could not have been selected and with, a story relating to an experience of his, as a chcchaco plunged immediately in, to the derivation of thc-word and ex, plained its different evolutions from the, time the Pilgrims landed as "new com, ers" on Plymouth Rock, to the present, time. "Chechacos," he said, "would, apply to newcomers in Alaska for a, good many years to come. The sour, dough* made the paths and hewed the, way. but it took the newcomers to till, in the chinks and develop the coun, try.", The speaker\'s remarks were instruc, tive and though given extemporaneous,, showed a thorough knowledge of the, subject. Several telling hits of wit, icism were given to advantage., Then followed a selection by the male, quartet composed of Messrs R. G. anil, W. G. Rlanchard. J. Forrest and R. M, Taylor. The four gentlemen\'.; voices, blended most harmoniously and so well, did they do their part that nothing but, an encore would satisfy the delighted, listeners., Dr. Hall then in able remarks intro, duced Judge C. A. Sehlbrcde. whom he, called V. M. C. A. sourdough. The, judge toasted sourdoughs and said they, were found al over the world only call, ed different names in various sections., He related several instances of sour, loughi-m and juade a* pleasing trib, ute to the Y. M. C. A. work in Skag, way., 11. A. Hauer responded tc. the toast, "Stampedes," and although he said it, was his first appearance in that role he, proved to be thoroughly at home., Rev. M. A. Covington resnonded to, the toast "Rich Claims," and this figur, ative subject he pleasingly and deli, oat civ wove into a masterful tribute to, the ladies saying they were the rich, est claims that could ever be found and, treasured by man., E. T. Pope, who was to have had the, toast, the "Clean-up" was absent and, Toastmaster Hall in a clever and point, ed introduction, asked Secretary Reid, who was the prime mover in the suc, cess of the banquet and who worked, tireless in his endeavors to make it, a pronounced success, to take the sub, ject. Mr. Reid responded reluctant!/,, but in an easy and delightful manner, gave several stories and ended by say*, ing that the clean up in which he was, mostlv interested in was that of the, evening\'s aftermath., It was shortly after midnight when, the last number was performed and, a happy and thoroughly satisfied, crowd silently voted the affair one of, the great successes and silently depart,, cd homeward., Cold, Feet, The remedy is a hot water bottle. It is a family necessity, and no per, son should be without one. You cannot tell when someone in your family, may be attacked with a chill, rheumatis mor neuralgia, when a water bottle, will afford almost instant means of relief., We have them in all grades, sizes and prices.

I, will, after I am convinced of Ins peni, tence. meet him upon any platform., In the light of the disclosures by Dr, Hillis his firm stand in the matter will, commend the approbation of all right, minded men.
