The air blew freshly in\nfrom the sound and the water broke\non the beach in long, lazy rolls. Three\nwhole days to spend on a tiny island\noff the Connecticut shore, three days\nof driftwood and marshmallow parties.\nMaud said therd were quite a number\nof the art colony left still, so she\nwould not be lonesome.\n"You\'ll like them all excepting Fal\nlows. He\'s perfectly hopeless when it\ncomes to sociability. George says he\'s\nall right among the men, but he\ndoesn\'t like women. Can\'t even bear\nthem near him. I wonder who hurt\nhim, Kate?"\nKate\'s conscience was clear. She\nbad met Hartley Fallows back in town\nat a few affairs the past year. Once\nhe had stood next her at the prelim\ninary reception to a dinner at the\nWaldorf in honor of some notable\nparty, and she had noticed a long\ncurly blonde hair on his black coat.\nBlessed with a sense of humor, she\nhad said very gently, "She has blonde\nhair, hasn\'t she, Mr. Fallows?"\nAnd he had turned horribly red and\nlooked very distant and embarrassed.\neven while he plucked off the blonde\nhair. But he did not cast it from him.\nHe wound it absently around one fin\ngcr and stuck it in his pocket. Such\nthings change a man\'s whole life.\nIt was Just sunset when she came\nto the island. There was a flat-bottomed\nboat drawn up handily on the\nsandy shore. She called Maud over\nand over, then George, but neither ap\npeared. Sisters and brother-in-law\nare among the uncertain quantities of\nlife, but they had at least left the\nboat She pushed It off into the water\nand rowed over to the island.\nDeserted it was, and the little house\nalso, but the door was hospitably ajar,\nand she found everything within in\norder. Out In the little pantry she\nfound the remains of some cold boiled\nlobster and made herself a pot of tea.\nWith a supper tray beside her, she\nslipped out of the traveling suit into\na short skirt and middy, dragged a\niteamer chair out on the porch and\nsat down to enjoy herself.

They\nare called upon to furnish, under oath,\na detailed statement of their education\nand experience, including all the work\nthey have done since graduation They\nalso may be asked to submit an orig\ninal thesis or report on published\nworks, and they are required to give\nthe names of persons able and com\npetent to testify as to their experience\nand personal fitness.\n"Confidential Inquiry is made by the\ncommission from various sources as\nwell as of all persons referred to by\ntho applicant.

Such testimony ap\nproximates, If not equals, the testi\nmony adduced upon cross-examination\nIn judicial proceedings.

Let\nus therefore as many as be perfect be\nthus minded -Phil. 3 13, 15.\nTills text makes it clear that there\nis a sense in which Christians can not\nbe perfect and an\nother sense In\nwhich they may\nbe perfect\nThe apostle\nstates clearly that\nhe has not already\nattained, neither\nis already perfect,\nor as the Revised\nVersion reads,\n"made perfect."\nThe verse preced\ning speaks of the\nresurrection o f\nthe dead, so that\nhis disavowal evi\ndently has to do\nwith the perfec\ntion -which will come in the future. It\nmay seem to some unnecessary that\na man should disavow this final per\nfection since he is evidently not yet\nraised from the dead; but the human\nmind is capable of very strange things,\nand this same apostle Paul speaks of\nsome In his day who taught that the\nresurrection 5s past already. On\nsome such basis, it seems, that teach\ners arose who declared that even now\nwe may reach the perfection which be\nlongs to the resurrection state. The\napostle is clearly against such a doc\ntrine. Bishop Moule, one of the most saint\nly men the modern church has pro\nduced, in commenting upon this pas\nsage says: "As far as my own obser\nvation goes, such views (i. e. of per\nfection) are not uncommonly attended,\nin those who hold them, by a certain\noblivion to personal shortcomings and\nInconsistencies; by an obscuration of\nconsciousness, and of conscience.\nmore or less marked, towards the sin\nfulness of ordinary, everyday viola\ntions of the law of holiness in respect\nof meekness, humbleness of mind, long\nsuffering, sympathy, and other quiet\ngraces."\nIndeed, the saints of all the ages\nunite with Paul in declaring that they\nare not already perfect. The apostle,\nafter suffering many things for\nChrist\'s sake so that he bore In his\nbody the marks of the Lord Jesus,\nwrites of himself as "chief of sinners."\nJohn Bunyan although he spent twelve\nyears in Bedford jail for his Lord,\ncalls his life story "Grace Abounding\nto the Chief of Sinners." When John\nWesley thought he was dying, he re\nviewed his labors of sixty years, but\ncould find no peg upon which to hang\nany hope of salvation; he could only\nrepeat the sentimont of the hymn,\nT the rhW of sfunrs am.\nBut Jesus died for m.\nNow Is the Time For You\nTo Make Money.

While it is bloom\ning at the back of a lot it is a sight\nworth seeing. The seeds are used for\nchicken feed and a variety of purposes.\nThe same spirit was manifested by\nCharles Spurgeon, who said during the\nserious illness, that if he got well he\nwould have many things to preach,\nbut Just at that time; four words were\nenough for him, "Jesus died for me."\nDr. A. J. Gordon was a man of such\nsaintly character that his very face\ngave evidence of the indwelling light.\nBut the other portion of our text\nspeaks of a sense In which we may\nbe perfect. The context shows that\nthe apostle is using the figure of a run\nner In a race. He has not yet at\ntained the prize, but forgetting the\nthings which are behind and reaching\nforth unto those which are before, he\npresses toward the mark. It Is this\nattitude to which the word "perfect"\nis applied. The man has laid aside\nthe weights and the easily besetting\nsin; he is not content with what he\nhas attained, but forgetting that which\nis behind, he presses with neck\nstretched forth and every muscle\nstrained, to the goal. It will be seen\nat once that this sort of perfection is\nvery imperfect and is in no sense a\nfinality. It only prepares us to be\nmade perfect in the day of Christ\'s\ncoming. Nevertheless we are bound\nby the grace of Christ to fulfill this\nideal and not to put him to shame.\nTwo matters are Involved in the ex\nhortation to bo "thus minded." Tlrst\nof all if we feel like the apostle, we\nwill have the lowly estimate of our\nselves of which we have spoken, the\nfeeling that we have not attained.\nVery far from Christian perfection Is\npride; on the contrary, humility Is its\nvery essence. Again, If we are per\nfect in the sense of which, tho apostle\nspeaks, we will emulate him in\npressing forward for the prize of final\nglory. This is the very opposite of\ncomplacency as to our attainment. It\nIs said \'that Thorwaldsen once wept\nbecause he was satisfied with a statue\nhe had made.

The stone\ncavity of peaches filled with chopped\nquts and arranged on lettuce with\nmayonnaise is very tasty. A pretty\nI salad can be made from watermelon or\ncantaloupe by scooping out with a large\nspoon pieces from the ripest parts,\ndraining, chilling and serving in let\ntuce cups with French dressing. When\nmayonnaise is used with fruits, leave\nout the mustard and pepper, put in a\nlittle sugar and use lemon instead of\nvinegar always. In no case should a\nboiled acid dressing be used with fruit\nsalad.\nm\nto Skeptics\n$3 to $5 1\nAll Work\nGuaranteed\n10 Years\nMoyen Age Effect, With Novelties, Is\nthe tatest of Designs One of\nthe Best of the Results\nAchieved Is Shown.\nThere is a designer named Maur\ner in Paris, whose name is not her\nalded far and wide, hut whose cos\ntumes are bought and sold by the\nmost important American houses. An\nadmirable gown she made this season\ncarries out the moyen age effect. It\nhas a green velvet bodice with arm\nholes, shoulders, elbows and hips out\nlined with a broadly striped silk.\nThere are women who would dislike to\nhave their curves and angles so def\ninitely marked out and brought to\nnotice, but the color effect is good.\nThe striped silk itself is framed in\nwith a narrow edge of gold braid;\nthis manipulation of trimming is one\nof those trifles that count in clothes\nand is always gratefully received by\nthe woman who is in search of some\nornamentation not commonplace.\nThe skirt beneath this medieval\ngreen bodice is of biscuit-colored cloth\nto match in color the barrel-shaped\nsleeves of biscuit-colored chiffon.\nThere\'s novelty for you.\nPaquin gets the credit of Inventing\nttoe leather jacket but many design\ners must have followed on her heels\nquickly, for several of these coats\nappear under several names. The one\nthat bears her label is of white leath\ner, very thin, collared and cuffed with\nfur. It buttons straight down the front\nand has a wide slit pocket at each hip.\nIt is a novelty, of course, like the\nfascinating little muff that Worth in\nvented. It consists of two small pock\nets of fur Joined in the middle with a\nfanciful cord.

These frocks may\nbe of the elaborate sort, part chiffon\nor lace or silk much trimmed, but\nnewer are the simple, one-piece frocks\nof velvet, almost untrimmed save for\nmere touches of fur or embroidery\nand buttons, made, in fact, with al\nmost exaggerated simplicity, but with\ncareful Attention to line. Many of\nthese have high, close collars of the\nvelvet, bordered at the top with fur,\nor relieved at the top by some white\ncollar arrangement; but these straight\nup and down all-velvet models, while\nundeniably chic, are as undeniably\ntoo hot for comfort in our overheated\nbuildings and practical only for street\nwear under fur coats or with small\nfurs.\nRecognizing this fault, some of the\ndesigners have arranged the collar so\nthat from a high, close, velvet choker\nit may be unbuttoned and turned over\ninto a lace-faced, rolling collar, but\neven that leaves the all-velvet bodico\na very hot affair.\nNew Cretonne Cushions.\nThere are some interesting new\ncushions for cretonne chairs that are\nmade with a little apron attachment\nin front that hangs down from eight\ninches to a foot over the front of the\nchair. They are made of stenciled\nlinen or cretonne, and the little flap is\nedged with linen fringe about an inch\nwide. They are a novelty and vesy\nattractive.\nThe Moravians were the first Protes\ntants to declare that the evangeliza\ntion of the heathen was obligatory up\non the church.
