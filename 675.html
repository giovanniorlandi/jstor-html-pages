The large business concerns of the city,\nboth wholesaj and retail, have never discriminated against the\nmembers ot either race, ‘there may have been paltry eatcfctptioaa,\nwe find narrow minte d people everywhere, but it is a self evi\ndent fact that if we would keep the erty* pros; rousf, t*>e mem\nbers of ead» racp, must respect the rights of the other.
