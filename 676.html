Manning, di, i rector of the Bureau of Mines, De, partment of the Interior, in the year, ly statement on the reduction of gas, oline in this country., TnT* 1916, before the United States, entered the war, according to the, statement the production of gasoline, was a little short of fifty million bar, : rels. In 1917, when war activity was, accelerated by the entry of the Uni, ted States into the war, the produc, tion of gasoline had increased to, nearly sixty-eight million barrels, an, increase of more than fifty thousand, barrels a day., It was thought by many that this, must be the peak of American patri, i otic effort, but in 1918, when the war, had assumed even greater propor, tions, the production of gasoline was, over eighty-five million barrels, an, increase for the year of more than, seventeen million barrels. The daily, (increase for this year over the record-, I breaking year 0f\'1917 was about for, ty-seven thousand barrels for each, of the 365 days, or almost as much, more as the increase of the previous, | year., How this country sent an ever in, creasing flood of this gasoline to the, |allies and to friendly countries is, seen in thp export figures. In 1916, | there were 8,473,102 ban-els of gaso, -1 line sent abroad. In 1917 this amount, had increased to 9,901,877 barrels, an, increase of about 4,000 barrels a day., In 1918 these exports had reached a, total of 13,312,508 barrels, an increase, of nearly 10,000 barrels a day over, the year 1917. ■, It is the opinion of Mr. Manning, that no single industry in this coun, try of so important a nature ever, made such a showing in a single year, and he doubts if the future will ever I, . show such a record of achievement., ♦, CHAUTAUQUA AT, NOGALES IN MAY, AN INTERESTING, STRONG PROGRAM I, The Oasis is in receipt of a letter, from Mr. Ray Anderson, publicity I, manager for the Ellison-White Chau, tauqua system, at Portland, Oregon,, conveying the information that the, Nogales Chautauqua will open on, May 4, and continue until May 10,, inclusive.

Dr. Charles Holy, Molony, rector of the great Christ, Church parish, St. Joseph, Missouri., The Rev. Dr. promptly replied that, he couldn’t leave his Lenten duties, to come to Nogales., Accordingly, the energetic lieuten, ant at once appealed to a long-time, friend of the Molony family, the Rev., A. Leffingwell, in charge of St. An, drew’s, Nogales. And, yesterday,, Tuesday afternoon, March 25, about, 2:30, the marriage was quietly sol, emnized in St. Andrew’s Episcopal, church., One bridesmaid was Miss Walk, er’s sister, Mrs. Ulrich J. Rainalter,, the other was an old-time friend oif, the Walker sisters, Mrs. Abner Long, ley, herself a Honolulu girl. The, best man was Lieut. U. J. Rainalter., 1 Other attendants on the groom were, iCapt. Abner Longley and Lieut. Benj., H. Watson, All the officers are con, nected with the 25th infantry., Lieut, and Mrs. Geo .H.
