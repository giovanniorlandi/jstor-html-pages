Dunne, Sec\'y of State\nStevenson and others, together with\nHenry W. Huttmann, the anti-labor\ncandidate for lieut. governor, was\nresponsible for a sensational shake\nup in the political situation in Demo\ncratic circles today.\nHuttmann is the man that Jake\nLoeb and the Illinois Manufacturers\'\ncrowd are trying to make lieutenant\ngovernor. They don\'t want a man in\nthat job who is willing to give labor\n2k square deal. A lieutenant governor\nas wielder of the gavel in the state,\nsenate can throttle legislation he\ndoes not approve of. Huttmann has\nbeen condemned by the Chicago\nFederation of Labor, and the Illinois\nFederation \'of Labor has notified\nevery local, throughout the state to\nbe- on the lookout, to see that Hutt\nmann is nipped in the bud in. the in\nterest of organized labor and hu\nmane legislation.\nIt was learned today that 200,000\nballots had been printed and were\nbeing distributed by supposed friends\nof the Dunne administration, endors\ning the Huttmann anti-labor candi\ndacy. Immediately there was a roar\nof indignation from friends of Dunne\nin labor circles.\nEmmett Flood, local organizer of\nthe American Federation of Labor,\nand other labor leaders started to\nrun down the real source of the dis\ntribution of the marked ballots. They\ndiscovered that the ballots were be\ning secretly distributed by Hutt\nmann\'s anti-labor friends in an at\ntempt to deceive the electors. Gov.\nDunne flatly repudiated "the ballots\nand stamped them as a fraud. Wm.\nL. O\'Connell, Dunne manager, em\nphatically declared the ballots had\nnot been circulated with his knowl-\nT\'the uses,of the name of John Gibbons,\nDunne appointee and lieutenant,\nwas a deliberate attempt on the part\nof Dunne\'s enemies to make it ap\npear that Dunne was hostile to labor.\nSec\'y of State Stevenson and\nPhilip J. McKenna, who were also\nendorsed on the marked ballots,\njoined in denouncing the trick. They\nsaid their names were used without\nauthority.\nLabor leaders propose to lay the\nmarked ballot stunt Before County\nJudge Scully and demand an investi\ngation by the -election commission\ners\' office to ascertain exactly who\nwere responsible for the distribution\nof the ballots. It is believed that\nGov. Dunne will join Labor in the de\nmand tb have the fraud run to earth.\n6 o\nSENATE TO PROBE CHARGE OF\nCANADIAN LOBBY\nWashington, Sept 8 The senate\n, lobby committee will investigate\ncharges of Senator Chamberlain,\nmade on the floor late last night that\nSir Joseph Polk and other Canadian\nofficials lobbied against adoption of\nthe? Chamberlain amendment to the\nrevenue bill. This would havepre\nvente\'d admission into the United\nStates of halibut or salmon from the\'\nnorth Pacific, except when the fish\nwere senWn bond from an American"\nport.\nThe investigation is ordered by a\nresolution introduced today by Sen\nator Curtis just before adjournment\nof congress andadopted without a\nvote.\nPETTIT GIVES MURDER REASON\nDetails of the married life that\nended in death were given by J. Mau\nrice Pettit yesterday in a long talk\nto one of State\'s Att\'y Hoyne\'s aids.\nvPettit desired to live in spiritual\nlove without physical contact.

Be\ncause he bore a Federal league label?\nBennie was severely pannd by some\ncritics who saw red every time that\norganization was mentioned. He did\nnot hit .300 and they jumped him.\nBennie never gave out a tenth of he\nbunk credited to him in interviews.\nScribes with the New York team are\na unit in saying Bennie is a-regular\nfellow, who knows his own short\ncomings and says frankly he would\nlike to be somewhere near as good\nas Ty Cobb.\nKauff is a dandy hitter and can run\nbases and- field. He is a fine ball\nplayer and if he had a chance to ex\nercise some individuality would look\nmuch better. The McGraw system\nwas never meant for a man of the\nKauff type.\nJohn McGraw says Luther Taylor,\nwhile bein the last deaf mute to\nplay in the big leagues, was not the\nlast "dummy." i\nBy Mark Shield\'s\nUnheraTded, never mentioned in\nblack type, one outfielder on the\nSouth Side is playing the most sen\nsational game that section of the\ncity has looked at for some time. He\nisn\'t Joe Jackson aind his name isn\'t\nCollins.\nHap Felsch is the superhuman\ngent, and the ex-Milwaukee man is\ndoing everything any other outfielder\never did, and doing it nearly every\nday of the week. Felsch is a fine\nballplayer, one of the best garden\nmen in the Johnson circuit, yet little\nis heard of him in the public prints.\nMuch space has been rfovnaH n\nthe marvelous fielding of John Col-\nuns, yet eiscn is every bit as good\na ueienesive man as Shano and 70\npoints better as a batter. He can\ntravel to either side, come forward or"\ngo back after flies, and throws like\na rifle shot and with uncanny accu\nracy. He is not given to the flashy\nline throws that Joe Jackson exhib\nits, but he bounces the ball to the in\nfield or any base with enough speed\nand precision to stop runners.\nTwice yesterday he made assists\nand one broke a Cleveland rally and\nleft the score small enough ?to en\nable the Sox to win.

Lusty screams\nbrought 50 women and two police\nmen. After a battle the policemen\ncarried off a battered remnant of a\nmasher to the night court\nMiss Alice Smith, probation officer\nof the woman\'s night court, says the\nthing\' to do is to haul the masher\ninto court.\nBut if -timid women shrink from\nasking aid of a policeman, how can\nthey endure the notoriety of appear- :\nance in a court room?\nI asked Jane Cowl, an actress\nbeautiful enough to warrant undue .\nI\nkAM', 'mmmmwsmv"\nattention, how she handled the\nmasher.

Although these comments 1\nexpress something of admiration, It\nIs an admiration tinged with ances\ntral contempt.\nRecently, I drove in my car to Riv\nerside drive and alighted to walk. A\nyoung man came by and accosted\nme.

"Hold on, Darley, don\'t spoil a\nguerdon of good luck."\n"Good luck a black cat! Throw\nher out of the window."\n.

At 9:30 in steps\na Velvet-shod feline visitor, scans\nthe environment, proceeds to settle\ndown on the window sill yonder,\npurrs complacently and remains a\npresage, a harbinger. Don\'t dis\nturb Miss. Kitty for worlds!"\n"All right, humor ydur whims,\nonly a cat is neither dignified nor\nbusinesslike. I\'ll vanish. Here\nthe first answer to your advertise\nment for an assistant."\nThe friend of the young lawyer\ndeparted. A young lady entered\nbareheaded, which was queer, Morse\nthought, and rather excited in ap\npearance, he discerned, for which he\ncould not account The cat blinked\nand purred. He paused to stroke it\ngently and then faced this girl vis\nitor. Morse had put up his, shingle in a\nmodest way, not in the business cen\nter, but on a little street off the main\nthoroughfare. The little building he\nwas in had been a real estate office.\nEverything beyond it in the block\nwas residential. Next door was a\npretty cottage with a lovely garden.\n"You have come in response to\nmy advertisement for an office clerk,\nI presume?" observed Morse, noting\na palpable embarrassment on the\npart of his visitor, which he attrib\nuted to maidenly shyness and inex\nperience and ever manly and indul\ngent -where theopposite sex was con\ncerned. "I am just entering in on\nmy profession and need an assistant\n.to copy my papers, keep records and\nattend to the office while I am away.\nI cannot pay more than 6 a week at\nthe start. Ah! my guest is rather\nunceremonious."\nTabby had left the window sill,\nhad walked over Jto the young lady,\nrubbed itself against her dress, sub\nmitted to her petting with satisfac\ntion, performed the same actions\nwith Morse, and returned to the win\ndow sill as if, a courteous duty per-\nAA\' ,\nLifted a Heavy Billy and Struck Him\'\nformed, its reward- was peace and\nsleep. \'.\nThe young lady again puzzled\nMorse. She had kept her eyes fixed\non the cat and a queer smile .crossed\nher face. He could not analyze\npleased, quizzical, mysterious.\n"You you like kittens?" she\nspoke a trifle hesitatingly.\n"This one immensely. You see, I\nconsider it a sort of good fortune\nsign to have a black cat come to you\nand really take to you on the thres\nhold of your first business enterprise.\n9', 'Maybe that\'s all sentiment, but I am\nreally pleased. And now, miss, as to\nthe position."\n"I I am quite inexperienced,"\nsaid the visitor frankly, and then,\nhke the free-hearted, ingenuous fel\nlow that he was, mightily attracted\nby the sweet face and charming\ns manner of the young lady, Morse\npreceded to make the work expect\ned as light and easy as possible. At\nhis request she wrote her name\nAlison Scoville and promised to be\non hand at 9 o\'clock the next morn\ning. Tabby followed the young lady to\nthe door, mewed beseechingly and\nthen went back to the window silL\nMorse proceeded to the nearest del\nicatessen and provided a store of\nfood for his mascot\nBy evening the\'feline seemed fully\ndomesticated. It made a leap out\nof the window into the adjoining gar\nden several times, but returned later\n. and was quite some company to the\nyoung lawyer.\nThe good luck really came. "Either\nyou or the kitteri brought it," said\nx Morse to Miss Scoville one day. "Two\ncases came in today and I am depu\ntized to close up a ?4,0Q0 deal where\nI receive 5 per cent commission."\n"I am glad," said Alison in her sin\ncere, simple way.\n"This looks like progress," ob\nserved Morse\'s friend, Darley, com\ning into the office one day and sur\nveying a small but compact iron\nstrongbox as near to a safe as Morse\ncould afford to buy just then.\n"Yes," nodded the young lawyer,\ncheerily, "getting on finely."\n. "I see you have that black cat yet"\n"Oh, my mascot? Quite!" de\nclared Morse with a hearty laugh.\n"And the young lady?"\n"Shares the honoTs. She is a jewel\nof industry and intelligence"\nLate one afternoon Morse sat\nCounting a heap of banknotes. They\nrepresented the money he was to pay\nin the adjustment he had told Alison\nabout, He concluded his task and.l\nput them in the strongbox. At just\nthat moment a shadow crossed th,\nfloor. Morse looked up to encounter\na rough-looking man.\n"Jones & Smith?" spoke the"\nstranger.\n"No such firm in the building," ob\nserved Morse, and the intruder, de\nparted. "\nIt was to return a minute later,\nhowever. Morse was just closing his,\ndesk when the man, stealing, tiptoe\ning toward him, lifted a heavy billy\nand struck him down, bleeding and\nsenseless.\n"Now, then, easy work, if I\'m not\ninterrupted," muttered the wretch\nand turned, to the strongbox. "Ugh!"\nHe fell back at Tabby sprang at\nhim, bristling, spitting, sinking her\nclaws deep into his evil face. He\ngave her a fling as he clutched her\nand she landed directly across the\nprostrate body of Morse. Then\nwith a moan and limping! she fled\nfrom the room.\nThe man searched for the key to\nth,e strongbox, failed to locate the se\ncret drawer in the desk where it re\nposed, and produced some burglar\ntools.\nHe pried, drilled and hammered.\nSo engrossed was -he that he did not\nnotice\' a fluttering form at the open\ndoorway. It was that of Alison., She\nuttered a suppressed cry and disap\npeared. Just as the burglar had wrenched\nup the lid of the strongbox, Alison re\nappeared with two policemen. Then,\nthe criminal in charge, the money In\nthe strongbox safe, Alison ran to the\nnearest drug store.\n"Nothing serious," reported the\ndoctor with whom she hastened back\nto the office, as he dressed the young\nlawyer\'s wounded head and Morse\nopened his eyes and surveyed the\ngroup about him in bewilderment In\namazment he heard Alison\'s story in\npart.\n"But how did you happen to come\nto the office?" he inquired, whea\nthey were alone. i\nJgSa.fa..t. iv- - ,\ntiftfittMiiMiitiiiiAMi', '\' "Tabby," answered Alison simply.\n"You mean "\n"She came crawling into our\nhouse all covered with blood.

A dunce can criticize. A fool\ncan tear down. There is nothing\nmore common or certain than hu\nman error, and there is no job easier\nthan that\' of picking flaws in any\nthing or any creature. Yet every\npresidential campaign in our coun\nf try, a country wherein the average\nof intelligence is unusually high,\nseems to be devoted to reckless crit\nicism, foolish demolition of polities\nand characters and the public exploi\ntation of human mistakes and weak\nnesses. St Peter himself running\nfor president in these United States\nwould have to be largely on the de\nfensive and he would come through\nwondering if he were not, indeed, a\npretty close relative to the devil him\nself. We know what the campaign of\nMr. Hughes and his backers is to be.\nIt is to damn President Wilson for\nwhat mistakes e has possibly made.\nIt is to criticize, tear down, pick\nflaws.\' In only one important re\nspect\' does\' it suggest constructive\nness. That is the raising of the tar\niff schedules, and the war makes it\nabsolutely uncertain whether the,\npresent tariff is a bad or a good\'\nv thing, even to the knowledge of\nthose who believe in the principle of\nprotection. We do not say that Mr.\nHughes\' campaign policy is not po\nlitic. It is. -When the other fellow\nhas a fine record for constructive-!\nness, criticism is the best and only\npolicy against him, unless you have\nsomething better in the way of con\nstructiveness to offer, and if Mr\nHughes has such light he is keeping\nit under the most opaque bushel a\ncandidate could secure.\nThrough many campaigns Mr.\nWilson\'s party has been under the\ncharge of being a mere negative par\nty, opposed to all progressive move\nments, reactionary; But is Is differ-i\nent this time. The Wilson adminis\ntration can point to great construe\ntive, works, and it will, undoubtedly,\nwisely base its campaign on what it\nhas done, rather than on defense of\nwhat its adversaries say it didn\'t do.\nUnder the Wilson administration\nthe country has "been given the fed\neral bank reserve act Panic among:\na hundred million people at the com\nmand of a few mighty gamblers is no\nlonger possible. It is constructive,\nand for the people.\nThe Clayton legislation takes hu\nman labor and lives from the list of:\nmarket commodities and articles of\ncommerce.

Now\' that\nthe children are returning to school\nwe shall hear much of tonsils and\nadenoids and the need of operation\nfor their removal. \'\nA few years ago the removal of\ntonsils and adenoids was popular and\none doctor boasts of having 4,000\npairs of tonsils in bottles in bis office.\nBut the late Dr. J. B. Murphy, in a\nmonograph published shortly before\nbis .death, said that he had observed\nthat about two years after a person\nhad the tonsils and adenoids remov-\'\ned there would be a case of appendi\ncitis. Now, in addition to those ob\nservations, it is well known in the\nhomeopathic profession that in those\ncases, about two years after the ap\npendix is removed, pulmonary tuber\nculosis sets in. The lungs cannot be\ncut out, therefore there is nothing\nmore to do for that patient, from\nthe old point of view. His next stage\nis death.\nBut there is a better way! En\nlarged tonsils and adenoids are na\nture\'s danger signal, saying that this\nchild is rawjnaterial for tuberculosis\nunless properly treated. That poison\ncannot be cut out of the blood with a\nknife, but it can be removed by prop\ner medical treatment If the child at\nthis time is given proper medica.1, not\nsurgical treatment, this tendency to\ntuberculosis can be entirely eradi\ncated. Then appendicitis will be\navoided, consumption will not arrive\nand a useful life will be saved. Do\nnot have operation on tonsils or ade\nnoids. A further danger is illustrated by\nthe fact that in Chicago within the\nlast year a boy and a girl each died\nfrom the chloroform before the op\neration was begun, and another child\ndied an hour after operation from\nembolism to the-hraku Theseare ac-i\nfimfiitidiAAilitiflifefcaftiM\nIKt', 'cldents which, cannot be foreseen noi\nprevented, except by avoiding opera-\'\ntion.\nA third consideration is, that ade\nnoids return within a year in 75 per\ncent or more of all cases operated\nunless the child is taught to breathe\nproperly. If he is taught to breathe\nthrough the nose and given proper\ntreatment they win disappear en\ntirely. ,\nThe tonsil is an organ of excretion\nand its removal Ti&s been known to\nbe followed in different cases by ec\nzema, rheumatism, appendfcitis aha\n"consump\'tion. Save the tonsils and\nsave your children. E. B. Beckwith,\nIVf.

Opposed to this statement by Mr.\nHughes, Mr. McCormick intends to\ncirculate Pres.

C. did\nnot do something for the Oram\'s.\n"Mr. Lies is mistaken when he says\nthe Charities did not discourage the\noperation on Oram but encouraged\nit I worked for many weeks along\nwith others in a fruitless attempt to\nget Oram out of th,e Bridewell that\nhe might undergo the operation and\nI am confident it was the United\nCharities that was blocking the\nmoves to liberate Oram. Oram would\nprobabjy be in\' the Bridewell yet were\nit not for the intercession of Corpor\nation Courfsel Ettelsdh."\n"The United Charities is now giv\ning a little for the support of my two\nchildren," said Mrs. Oram. "It is not\naiding me. This week I waS for four\ndays without food. For years the\nCharities has been trying to get my\nchildren and send them away to an\ninstitution, they even tried that\'tHis\nWednesday when Mr. Oram was lying\nat the point of death in the hospital.\n"Friends of mine have told me how\nagents of the United Charities went\nto them, told them I was a dope fiend\nand should not be helped. I haye\nnever touched dope:"\n"The Charities tqld me of spend\ning ?14.50 in one-week for supplies\nior the Orams," said Mrs. Carmen.\n"I went to the stores where the agent\nsaid the supplies were bought and\nfound bills totaling $3.63. 1 went back\nto the U. C. office and asked to see\nthe bills for the rest of the suDDlieg\nit said it had bought, but the wom\nan told me they did not have any\nother bills." \'\n"The United Charities has helped\nthe children a little," said Mrs. Louise\nWolff, 1749 W. Monroe, Mrs. Oram\'s\nlandlady, "but only a -little so far as\nI have seen. I am taking \'care or\nthem now? The Chajities wants to\nsend the children to Glenwood; that\'s\nno place for such fine lads."\nThe Charities suggested to one in\nterested woman thatit would be fine\nsend ttie children on a "vacation" to\nGlenwood. -\nFriends of the Orams today agreed\nthat the help of the U.
