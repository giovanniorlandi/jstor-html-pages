Mr. Beall think» Senator\nHanna could have had the nomina\ntion if he would have signified bis\nwillingness thirty day» a«ro to ac\ncept it. His party now has him so\ntied up by obligations that he is not\nfree to accept the nomination. Were\nhe to be placed at the head of the\nrepublican ticket, said Mr. B»all,\nhe Wf>uld sweep the country before\n! hlni, and the democrats would have\nthe fl^htjof their lives to defeat him.\nι Mr. Beall save the recent speech\n, of Senator Hoar was a bombshell\nthrown into republican rank- and\nthat it lias doue a threat deal to stiff\nen the ha*kbv>0e« of the dem >crats\n. .\nRem<mib«t that w»· have the iar\nk>\'»t ln»e ui Chocolat*·» in the city at\nKinplrtf^nakery. tf\nPreacher Remembered.\nL»»t lumnur the memorial ser-|\nmon for the Knights of Pythias was\npreached by Kev.
