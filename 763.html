The board has been loath to\ngrant this because of the cost involv\ned, but at the last meeting of the board\none citizen of large means proposed\nthat if an election is ordered, the ex\npense shall not fall on the tax payers.\nMr. Calhoun says that Jones eoun\nI ty on the east has a compulsory law,\nj and those on the border between Jones\nand Covington are suffering great in\n! convenience as a consequence.\n! stated further that Jefferson Davis, on\nthe west of Covington, is planning to\n! vote on the subject with good pros\n] pects of adopting the ordinance.
