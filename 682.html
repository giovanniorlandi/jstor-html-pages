James\nFrancis Case, a civil engineer, repre\nsenting the American International\nCorporation in Italy and Spnn, has\njust completed his first inspection\nof business possibilities in Italy. One\ngeneral conclusion he has drawn is\nthat Americans firms should do all\npossible to. lower the present high\nrates of exchange with the conclusion\nof the war.\nSaid Mr. Case to a correspondent\nof the Associated Press: "It has Deen\nwidely stated that American business\nin Europe will suffer after the war\nfrom the high value of the dollar, as\ncompared with other money, forcing\nthese nations to buy from each other\nor go without what 1 they need. For\ninstance, let us consider a pair of\nAmerican shoes, worth four dollars\nof our money. Before the war, four\ndollars were worth just over twenty\nlire, whereas now these four dollars\nare worth twenty-six lire. For all\nthat the lire has still the same buy\ning power in Italy, or in Russia, and\neven more in Austria or Germany,\nwhere the mark has depreciated. Nat\nurally, if an Italian can buy a pair\nof shoes in another country where\nhis lire has a better value than in\nthe United States, he is going to do\nso. v ,\n"The solution of this exchange\nproblem is inducing these countries\nto send us their goods to increase\ntheir trading with us. The reason\nthe exchange is now high is not so\nmuch that Europe\'s credit is bad with\nus, that we have no fait in her future\nprosperity; it is because we are not\nreceiving as much goods from her as\nbefore the war."\nNAVY CUTTER RUN DOWN;\nONE MAN WAS LOST\nSan Francisco, Nov. 26.

Mrs.\nInez Milhoiland Boissevain, suffrage\nleader, who has been ill here from\nanemia for several weeks, died last\nmidnight.\nInez Miholland Boissevain had been\nfor many years widely known for her\nactivity as a woman suffragist, a\nsocial welfare worker, an advocate of\nsocialism, and as a prcticing lawyer.)\nAs a student in Vassar College,\n1905-9, although knowns the college\nbeauty, and possessed of wealth and\nposition, she shunned society as such,\nand shocked the more conservative\ncollege opinion by her radical social\nviews. One of her acts during this\nperiod was to hold a suffrage meet\ning in a graveyard at night when per\nmission to hold the meeting in the\ncollege chapel had been refused her.\nShe also made a name for herself as\nan athlete, being captain of her class\nhockey team which won the college\nchampionship, and a member of the\n1909 track team, at which time she\nestablised a new record for the col\nlege in the eight-pound shot-put at\nSI feet, 8 7-8 inches. v\nAside from her college activities,\nshe worked among the poor children\nin the city of Poughkeepsie, ar.d had\nherself appointed court probation of\nficer. During her first college va\ncation she visited London and there\njoined the Pankhurst suffragettes,\nmaking several speeches, and. being\nonce arrested.\nDuring the 1908 presidential cam\npaign she won new fame as "the girl\nwho broke up the Taft parade." While\nthe parade was being held in New\nYork City, she stationed herself in a\nwindow and shouted: "Votes for\nWomen I" through a megaphone.\nSome of the\' marchers fell out of the\nparade and gathered around her to\nhear her make a speech for the suf\nfrage cause.\nFollowing her graduation from\nVassar College, she attempted to en\nter Harvard Law School, but this\npermission was denied her cn the\nground that it was no a co-educational\ninstitution.

She .returned to this\ncountry and continued her practice\nof law and suffrage activities. In\n1915 she was denied permission to\nmake a suffrage speech at the fiftieth\nanniversary ceremonies of Vassar\nCollege. Later the same year she\nwent to Italy as a war correspondent\nand was forced to leave Italy by the\nauthorities there because of her pa\nclfist writings.\nIn 1916 she went as a-delegate on\nthe Ford peace ship, but left the\nparty at Stockholm because, as she\nsaid In a statement, "the undemo\ncratic methods employed by the man\nagers are repugnant to my princi\npies." ,\nMrs. Boissevain was born in New\nYork, August 6, 18SS, receiving her\nearly education in New York, London\nand Berlin.

Rental\nagents state , that the growth is due,\nin a large measure, to the develop\nment of the aeronautic station, and\nthe consequent coming to Pensacola\nof scores of expert mechanics.\nOther building operations and the\nopening of new businesses is also\nconsidered as a large factor in the\ndevelopment. - The only difficulty, ac\ncording to rental agents, is the sup\nplying the demand which is being\nmade now, and to care for the future\nneeds.

Although\nthe supreme court had previously up\nheld constitutionality of the Mann\nwhite slave \' law, the question of\nwhether it prohibits interstate trans\nportation, of women only for commer\ncialized vice or applies to mere personal-\nimmoral escapades having no\nelement of commercialism or coerc\nion has been disputed ever since the\nlaw\'s enactment.\nInterpretation by, the supreme\ncourt of the disputed , point was\nasked in the celebrated Diggs-Cami-netti\ncases and in the case of L.- T.\nHays, of Alva, Okla. In all three\ncases, the government conceded,\nthere was no element of traffic for\ngain.\nCaminetti was sentenced to 18\nmonths\'imprisonmen t and fined $1,\n500; Diggs to two years and a $2,P00\nfine, Hays had an 18 months prison\nsentence. All have been at liberty\ntinder bail.\nLower federal courts, and different\nadministrations of the department of\njustice have diffeered over the law\'s\ninterpretation. Various women\'s\nclubs and other organizations have\nagitated for an interpretation to curb\nall immorality, whether commercial\nor not.\n. Two other important questions\nraised were, whether women were\naccomplices and, whether men might\nbe convicted solely upon a woman\'s\nuncorroborated testimony.\nWhile Diggs and Caminetti volun\ntarily gave some testimony they re\nfused some further testimony and\nthe trial judge instructed the jury to\nconsider such refusal in reaching\ntheir verdict, Digg3 and Caminetti\ncontended that "violated the const!1\ntutional clause exempting persons\nfrom testifying against themselves.\nThe ninth federal circuit court, how\never," held that, under various prece\ndents, the trial court\'s charge was\njustified, the defendants testifying\nvoluntarily but only in part.\nThe defendants contended that\ncongress never intended to include,\nwith classification as felons, offenses\nwhich are misdemeanors in most\nstates, but aimed the law against\npersons transporting women victims\nin commercialized white slave traf\nfic. Although Attorney General Wiek\nersham, in office when the law was\npassed, ruled that- it did not apply to\npersonal escapades, the suceeding ad\nministration held otherwise. The\nSecond, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth\nfederal circuit courts of appeal have\nsustained the broader interpretation,\nwhile other federal courts have held\nonly for the commercial construct\nion. Diggs and Caminetti were tried\nand convicted separately, the former\non August 20, 1913, and the latter qn\nSeptember 5, 1913. Their xases were\nconsolidated and affirmed March 18,\n1915, by the Ninth circuit court. In\nthe supreme court all three cases\nwere advanced, both sides desiring\nearly settlement of the disputed ques\ntions, and argued together in No\nvember, 1916, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral Wallace representing the\ngovernment and former Senator Bil\nley of Texas, Marshall B. Woodworth\nof San Francisco and Harry O. Glas\nser of Enid, Okla., the defendants.\nJustice .McReynolds took no part\nin considering the three cases, being\ndisqualified in having been attorney\ngeneral during prosecution of the\nthree defendants.\nSHIPPING NEWS\nArrived.\nMedian, Br $9, 4079, Bolton, Qal\nveston, to J.

The crop was shipped out of the state\nand the money put in circulation was new\nmoney.\nOf Spanish peanuts, the yield ranges\nfrom fifty to sixty bushels an acre. They\nare worth about $1 a bushel. The lard has, in\nthe meantime, been improved. There is a\nfine hay crop. In addition the\' hogs, al\nlowed to run over the fields after the crop\nlave been taken off, will make great gains\non the peanuts left in the ground, and whe1\nfinished off with porn, will bring the highest\nmarket price.\nThe lowly goober, which is associated in\nour minds with nickel purchases, and th\nmention of which evokes a smile, is a crop\nof tremendous importance. Of the despised\npeanut, the Texas crop alone amounted to\ntwenty-four million dollars this year. In\n1910 the entire crop of the United States\nwas worth a little over eighteen million dol\nlion. With the estabishment of mills to ex\ntract the oil, which has been found to be\nvery valuable, plantings will be multipled\neven more rapidly, and Florida is fortunate\nthat its lands are so well adapted to the cul\nture of what may some day be considered\none of the world\'s staples.\n. THE TROOPS WITHDRAW.\nAfter weeks of deadlock, and when all\nhopes of oreaching an understanding were\npractically abandoned, the American-\nivicxicdii commission nas signeu a protocol , The hand that signs\nproviding for the gradual withdrawal of rules the world.\nGeneral Pershing\'s troops from Mexico,\nand for the policing of the internationa1\nboundary by the respective armies of the\nUnited States and Mexico. In a supple\nmentary memorandum, the United States\nreserves the right to send a punitive expedi\ntion into Mexico in pursuit of any band\nthat crosses our border. That the protocol\nwill receive the official endorsement of this\ngovernment is, according to Washington\ndispatches, a foregone conclusion. The\nmatter is, therefore, squarely up to Car\nranza.\nWill he ratify? He has received practi\ncally everything he asked for- the with\ndrawal of our troops, which enables him\nOUR MILITARY SYSTEM.\nthe chsck\n- Ever since the prohibition election\nreturns came in, the wets have had\nwry faces.\nBilly Sunday should at least feel\ncomplimented that Helen Kellar, who\nis blind and deaf, said he is "the\nnoisiest .man (she) has ever heard."\nWhile the new dimes are very\npleasing from an artistic point of\nview, the sad reality is that they\nwon\'t buy as much as the old models.\nThe optimist is the man, who on\nThanksgiving Day will be happy that\ncranberries are cheaper than they\nwere and that turkey, isn\'t any high\ner than it is.\nIn order to cover the campaign de\nficit, we suggest that the democrats\nsell the Hughes goat.

Evictions are almost of daily\noccurrence.\nThe times are surely out of joint when\nmen must leave their wives and kiddies to\nstarve in order to protect the families of\nperfect strangers a couple of thousand miles\noff.\nFor this state of affairs there seems to be\nno. remedy under our present system. By\nour defence law, all enlisting in the militia\nmust serve six years, three in the reserve\nand three on active duty, and they may be\ndrafted into federal service by the presided\nif he thinks it necessary.\nThe militia has, therefore, lost its old\ntime state characteristic. Men are unable to\nbind themselves for six years without en\ndangering their business, and that is why\nthe militiamen are simply quitting.\nIs the national guard \'threatened? The\nEvening Post says that to meet its require\nment of 30,000 men, New York has been\nable to recruit, in September, only 372 men.\nand in October, only 184.

Bobby\nthought the comedian all that could\nbe desired in anybody and if a visitor\nasked him about his picture the only\nanswer they would receive was "I\'m\nworking with Mr. Bernard we have\nlots of fun together, don\'t we?" look\ning up at his friend who would be\nstanding close by.\nIt became a common sight to see\nBobby and Mr. Bernard eating lunch\ntogether and one day the little fellow\nfelt very much hurt when his friend\nforgot to take hold of his hand in one\nof the scenes.\nThis state of affairs lasted the en\ntire time tluring which the renowned\ncomedian was situated at the Vita\ngraph studios and when the day for\nhis departure came around, after the\npictures were finished, it would have\nbeen harder to find a more unhappy\nlittle boy than. Bobby although he is\nusually full of sunshine.\nHe was a little consoled, however,\nwhen his mother suggested that it\nwould be lots of fun to write to his\nfriend and receive letters in return\nand to the present time the corres\npondence has not been neglected by\neither.\nX\n.V\nODD, ISNT IT?\nArgument is a whetstone for the knife\nof invention.\n.

It sounds a bit\nparadoxical, since the theme of the\npicture is anti -royalist, but if Mr.\nHerbert lived in Vienna or Berlin he\nwould receive royal recognition for\nhaving composed this unique screen\nsymphony. As it is, the American\npublic pays a spontaneous tribute of\ntears and applause foot clapping as\nwell as hand clapping, for every time\nwe launch into one of those etirring\nmarches I can feel the vibrations of\nhundreds of feet beating time in ca\ndence with the soldiers oa the screen.\n"While the theme is entirely dif\nferent, the psychological effect is\nsimilar to the famous old Civil War\nvolunteer song, \'We Are Coming,\nFather Abraham, one hundred thou--sand\nstrong!\' and the icea is in the\nair now. It is as if the spectators\nwere marching in spirit with the sol\ndiers, for nothing more characteris\ntically American has ever been com\nposed. On the other hand, the march\nof the invaders has a 6ombre, sinis\nter tone which arouses no such re\nsponse from the audience. While not\nin a minor key it is built up on triads\nwhich give an odd outlandish effect.\nWith augmented fifths the same\ntheme develops into an exciting\nchase.\n, "In providing the principal charac\nters with individual themes Mr. Her\nbert has followed operatic style, but\nin general his construction\' is sym\nphonic. There is a scherso in the last -act\nthat is suitable for symphonv\nconcert while: the battle scenes arc\nnot excelled by any of the ultra-modern\ncomposers.\n"There is little tonality to this bat\ntle music, which might be called a\ncarefully calculated series of rhythmic\ndiscords rising to a caeaphonic cli\nmax. Its emotional effuct upon the\naudience is remarkable, j\'or when the\nfirst act closes with \'Ti\'.ps harmon\nized to the old hymn, \'Lead Kindly\nLight, it usually finds mo6t of the\naudience wiping their eyes.\n"And Victor Herbert," concluded\nMr. Sanford, . "composed this whole\nbattle scene in less than three hours\na genuine inspiration if ever there\nwas one. Of course the crchestration,\nalways a labor of love with Mr. Her\nbert, took very long, but it is a won\nderful conception."\nClear Bad Skin Frori Within.\nFimply, muddy complexions are\ndue to impurities in the blood.
