Collis had served for 12\nyears on tho force and was regarded\nas one of tho most reliable and effi\ncient men In tho polico department.\nHe had gone to Dixon\'s room on tho\nNegro\'s request Dixon said his mis\ntress had his clothes In her posses\nsion. Collis accompanied Dixon to tho\nroom and in a short time the men and\nwoman engaged in a quarrel which re\nsulted In Dixon shooting tho woman,\nwho Is variously known as Anna or\nMamie Corbln, in the left breast just\nover the heart. She fell unconscious\nat tho first shot and Collis jumped to\nward tho Negro to prevent his escape\nfrom the room. Dixon then fired four\nballs into Collis, the last of which pen\netrated his abdomen. Dixon then fled\nfrom the room.\nDixon immediately went to polico\nheadquarters and gave himself up. Ho\nwas taken to Jail and Collis and the\nwounded Negress were taken to the\nhospital. All afternoon tho killing of\nCollis was tho solo topic of conversa\ntion and both Police Judge Miller and\nCommon Pleas Judge Mower are free\nly censured. They both sentenced\nhim at various times to the jail and\nthe workhouse for from two to six\nmonths, but he was always- released\nbefore the expiration of his sentence.\nIt was the general feeling that a trial\nwould only result In an insufficient\nsentence and talk of a mob was fre\nquently heard beforo supper.\nAt 7:30 o\'clock Monday evening a\nmob of boys gathered In front of tho\njail. This group was augmented by\na few men and by 8 o\'clock 300 men\nhad congregated about tho Jail yard\nand steps. At ono time the Iron bar\nat the east entrance was removed and\nthe door partly opened. The police\nmen on the Inside promptly opened\nthe door and pulled the two nearest\nmen inside. This ended all active\nmoves to break the door until nearly\n11 o\'clock.\nAll .the windows In the jail and a.\nfew In the courthouse are broken.\nThis was done in the earlier part of\ntho evening, chiefly with brickbats and\nstones. At 9 o\'clock Sheriff Routza\nhan addressed the mob from the Jail\nsteps. Ho told tho men that there\nwould bo a special session of tho grand\njury called at once and the law would\nsurely give the Negro the limit for his\ncrime. He said further that any at\ntempts at forco would be met with\nforce, and much as ho deplored tho\ncrime, ho would bo compelled to fire If\nthe mob stormed tho jail. Ho said\ntho building was practically Impregna\nble and said that ho had a force of\ndeputies and polico lnsldo sufficient to\ndefend tho place for an indefinite time.\nOnly a small portion of tho mob heard\nhis voice, as hundreds of men In tho\nstreet below were calling out for Dix\non\'s life.\nUpon the request of Mayor Bowlus,\nMaJ. T. J. KIrkpatrick, of the Third O.\nV. I., .had Companies B and E in readi\nness to aid in defending the jail. Be\nforo either company was ready, how\nover, an entrance Into the Jail had\nbeen forced.\nWhen Dixon had been secured it re\nquired only a few minutes to push\nback tho small cordon of policemen,\nwho made their last stand at tho east\nentrance in an ineffectual attempt to\nkeep Dixon inside. Tho Negro\'s faco\nwas livid and when ho appeared at the\ntop of tho main steps ho would havo\nfallen from sheer terror had ho not\nbeen suspended In tie grasp of a doz\nen men. Tho police again rallied to\nhis aid and when tho mob saw this tho\nleaders hurriedly decided to kill their\nvictim beforo tho arrival of tho militia.\nDixon came hero from Cynthiapa, Ky.\nThero havo been 11 murders in\nClark county In tho last two years and\nin no instance has thero been a con\nviction for first degree murder. Sev\neral, of theso murders havo been of tho\ncord-blooded type and exasperating and\nthis fact, more than any other, Is re\nsponsible for tho first lynching In tho\nhistory of tho county. Thero has nev\ner yet been a case of capital punish\nment from this, Clark county.\nTHE KENTUCKY LEGISLATURE.\nThe Senate Will Not Act Upon House\nBills For a Time.\nFrankfort, March 8.

Hechinser\nCo.\nDEAR CUSTOMER:\nThree years ago we anchored here ; since then we have given\nMaysvilte a dry goods store different from any that had ever ex\nisted here. We were trained for an up-to-date dry goods busi\nness We do not claim that all our methods are original for we\nget ideas from some of the best dry goods stores in the country.\nWe doubt if there is a store in the world the size of ours that\nstands in with as many large stores as do we. That\'s to your\nas well as our advantage. A big store buys a large lot of un\nderwear at a very close price, says to us that we can have what\nwe want of it at cost price. Another store buys a million pounds\nof writing paper, says to us you can have ten pounds, one hun\ndred pounds or whatever you want at just what it costs us.\nThat\'s "standing in," do you get the idea ? Saturday the C.\nand O. freight office telephoned us that one hundred cases, car\npets, etc., (about 20,000 pounds) have arrived. We will open\nthem this week. Good things, that\'s sure. Come every day,\nfor every day will be opening day. Our Mr A. L. Merz tele\ngraphed that an offer he had made on a large lot of goods had\nbeen accepted. Prepare for a big sale when the goods come\nyou will hear from us. And now before closing we want to\nsay one word about Globe Stamps. Don\'t for one minute think\nwe give them to you because we are GENEROUS no, it\'s a\ncold business proposition we give them to make cash trade.\nMost houses we buy goods from say you can have so much time,\nbut we will give you a per cent, off for cash. That\'s what we\nsay stamps for cash. Some stores say they won\'t give stamps\nthey would have to mark their goods" higher. We are won\ndering if they did. We don\'t. Sincerely yours, MERZBROS.\nP.

George Kirk, was born in Lin\nden, Jefferson County, Ky., November 7,\n1873, and departed this life February 20,\n1904, in Chicago, where ho met with an\naccident that caused death. He was one\nof Belleflower\'s energetic and enterpris\ning young farmers and had gone into the\ncity with a car of fat cattle. The only\nway his people can account for his un\ntimely death was on account of losiog\nsleep by being up almoat three consecu\ntive nights, he was worn out. When he\nalighted from the car on the elevated\nroad at the Twelfth street station in\nstead of going out through the gateway\nand down the steps to the street, the\nsupposition is that he went .down tbe\nwalk inside about 800 feet until he came\nto the end of the walk, then took to the\nelevated track. He had not gone very\nfar when it is supposed ho aaw a train\napproaching and to avoid being struck\nstepped across the trolley wire to the\nroof of a flat about eighteen by twenty\nfour feet, and about thirty feet high. He\nlanded all right as bis tracks in the snow\nshowed that he had walked all around\nthe roof, looking for a place to get down.\nAt the corner there was a narrow ledge\nor projection. He Btepped down to that\nand the next step ho went to the ground.\nIn falling he came in contact with two\nheavy clothes line wires, breaking them\nin two when he struck them. He muBt\nhave struck with his face on the wires,\naB his face was cut badly. This occurred\nsome time after 3 o\'clock and he lay\nwhere he fell until 7:30 in the morning,\nwhen the police found him dead. He\nwas brought homo on the 0 o\'clock train\nand taken to bio father\'s house, three\nmiles south of town, where the funeral\nwas held.
