He began his business, career in Indianapolis, but soon, established branches in Chicago, New, York, and London. He made a specialty, of paper-covered novels, which, were sold on trains all over the country., Among the many foreign au, thors he popularized in this country, were Count Lyoff Tolstoi and Emile, Zola. During the panic of 1898 his, business collapsed, leaving him without, a dollar., During the years of his publishing, he had traveled nil over Europe, visiting, authors and prominent people., Over twenty years ago he was granted, an interview with the kaiser., DESPERADOES CAUGHT, Danville^ Va., April 7?News wa>, roceived here Monday afternoon oi, a thrilling sequence of events which, occurred ov: Easter Sunday at Stuarl, the county scat of Patrick County., .Pm and Sam Corn, acred itvcnt}, 1 live and thirty years, respectively,, \'.anted at Stuart on charges of fclo, ( . nlous .assault on Sunday morning, 1? 5 { .were found near the outskirts of thetown,, and. an attempt was made tt, arrest them. Outwitting the officers, who went to make the arrest, the, fugitives escaped, and, instead of, making For the open country, they, \' .oiit to Stuart, and marching up, jilain Street, armed with a shotgun, and a revolver, shouteil defiance to, every one" they saw., The* uproar soon attracted a crowd, which, however, did not seem an- j, .\\ious to uproach the men. Mayoi :, Pailey, notified by telephone, hurried-j, y called up other officers, and, ar- ], mcd with a rifle, he set out alone 10 j, the scene of the trouble. On arriving ., ho found the fugitives had made the, their way out of the town but Mayor, Bailey, unaided, pursued them and, caught up with them. After report-\', teuly calling on the men to sur, render, he fired at them continuous, ]y until he-had exhausted all of his., ammunition. Returning to Stuart., Mayor Bailey organized a posse, and ., the squad of men started out after, the Corns., Overtaken a mile from Stuart, the, fugitives barricaded themselves behind, a fence on the crest of a hill, and opened fire on the posse, which, .spreading out and seeking cover, returned, it heavily. The pursuers seeing, that the two men . ha|d the advantage, over :them,. divided, with, the intention of surrounding them on, the hilltop.

When, trouble started in Mexico he was, there, and he brought back pictures, that deeply stirred the committee on, foreign affairs when he showed them, here before the committee. Since the, great war started he has devoted his, time to that subject, and his years of, travel in Europe have been of threat, value in his work., Among: the features of\'.Mr. Neely\'s, lectures are an attack by a submarine, against a dreadnought ,soldiers crossing, the swollen Meuse, a military aviator, in action and troops firing at, him, presentation of Iron Crosses on, the firing line, hand to hand conflicts,, the Kaiser and Von Ilindcnburg at, the front, artillery duels and scenes, showing how the soldiers live., ; It would be useless to recapitulate, j all of the remarkable scenes to be, I shown. The important point is that, i the pictures are new and genuine., J Then after all one must not forget, ! the lecturer, Mr. F.
