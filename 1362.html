Howe completed\ntoday his plans to stamp out\nfood profiteering.\nHowe is a mild mannered ad\nministration sleuth whose job is\nto ferret out food racketeering,\nunder the new deal. He intends i\nto announce within a few days|\nthe details of a naticn-wide or-|\nganization to make war on the]\ngrasping grocer, the greedy,\nbutcher and the avaricious baker;\nwho fail to join their colleagues\'\nin co-operation.\nAs consumers counsel for the,\nagricultural adjustment adminis-j\ntration, Howe has completed a\nsurvey of bread prices in 18 rep-!\nresentative cities which indicates:\nmost bakers are co-operating,\nwith Presiednt Roosevelt’s re\ncovery program.\nThe doctor discovered that the\naverage cost of bread has gone\nup 1.4 cents per pound since\nFebruary. The cost of ingred\nients has risen 1.3 cents. The\nfigures showed that the price in;\n: Cincinnati, however went up 2.5 j\ncents whereas in Baltimore it;\nwas only .7 cents. Howe said he]\ni planned to ask the Cincinnati i\nbakers to explain.\nHe also has some questions to]\n] ask in Mobile, Ala., where bread I\nnow costs 9 cents a pound, and\nin San Francisco where it is 9.3 j\ncents a pound.

On the\nbasis of the budget bureau’s esti\nmate of a total revenue of $7,\n700,00 from the sales tax for 11\nmonths of the present fiscal year\n—the tax did not go into effect\nuntil July 1, so that collections\nthis year will be made or only 11\nmonths — the monthly revenue\nfrom it should average $700,000.\nBut Director McMulian does not\nbelieve this much will be collected\nthe first month.\n“There are several reasons why\nwe cannot expect maximum collec\ntions the first month the tax has\nbeen in effect,” McMulian said.\n“Perhaps the chief reason is that\nmerchants are not required to pay\nthe sales tax on credit sales until\nthe charge accounts are paid by\nthe customers. This means that\nnone of the sales tax on charge\nsales made in July will be paid in\nthe returns made by merchants\nfor July.\n“It is also true that a good\nmany merchants, especially large\nchain stores who must make their\nreturns through central offices\noutside the state, have been forced\nto obtain a 30-da.v extension, in\norder to permit them to have\nmore time to audit their ac\ncounts. Corporations operating\nfrom 20 to 100 chain stores in the\nstate are finding it almost impos\nsible to make retu ns on their\nsales tax collections by the 15th\nof this month. This will conse\nquently cause a considerable\nslump in the total collections for\nJuly.\n“Then there is the fact that\nJuly was the first month the tax\nwas in effect, with the result that\na good many merchants and their\nclerks were not entirely familiar\nwith the tax or with the system of\nkeeping the records of sales re\nquired, with the result that there\nwill undoubtedly be some shrink\nage of revenue on that account.\nAs a result, the July collections\nwill not be as large as some have\nhoped. But by the time we get\nthe August collections — which\nwill be due September 15th—we\nshould begin to get a better idea\nof the revenue we can expect.” J\n>— <?\nMississippi on\nCash Basis as\nBonds Are Sold\nJACKSON, Miss..

Lawrence, of Winston-Sa\nlem, president of the State Fed\neration of Labor, at the first day\nof the annual convention.\n“Unfortunately, large numbers\nof unscrupulous employers in this\nstate arc flagrantly violating the\ncodes under which they are op\nerating,” Lawrence charged.\n“Unless these violations are\ncorrected,” he threatened, ‘‘we in\ntend to turn the spotlight of mer\nciless publicity upon them.”\nDuring the closing moments cf\nthe session, resolutions were\nadopted demanding repeal of the\nstate tax and offering support to\n\'the state eight-months school\nterm, and advocating better sala\nries for teachers.\nLawrence concluded his address\nwith a ringing denunciation of the\nI state’s policy toward teachers, de\nI daring that the new public school\nlaw will compel educated teacher?\nto work for lower pay than the\nblanket code prescribes for com\nmon laborers.\nThe federation resolved that in\nits next questionnaire sent to can\ndidates for the state legislature\nwill be questions of whether they\nfavor repeal of the sales tax and\nof whether they will vote for state\nratification of the child labor\namendment.\nThe federation’s resolution on\neducation said that the organiza\ntion recognizes public education\nas the most important function of\ngovernment. The resolution urg\ned appointment of a state board\nof education controlling the state\nbudget for public instruction.\nThe resolution also advocated\nimprovement of the state system\nof financing schools by obtaining\nfunds for educational purposes\nfrom the gasoline tax. motor ve\nhicle tax, income tax, and mini\nmum property tax revenues.\nThe resolution advocated suf.\nficient salaries for teachers to at\ntract and hold within the profes\nsion the high type of teachers the\nchildren deserve. Salaries advo\ncated range from $1,500 to $3,\n800 a year for white and from\n$1,200 to $2,400 a year for col\nored teachers.\nConditions in South Carolina\nfurniture and w’ood-working plants\nwhore piece-work earnings of em\nployes are based upon 15 cents an\nhour and where they actually get\n10 cents, were deplored by J.

It is evident, according to Catton,\nthat a large majority of the people of the\ncountry are backing the NRA and are pro-;\nnosing to give the experiment a fair trial.\nIn spite of this fact, almost insurmountable\ndifficulties will be encountered as the\nmovement proceeds; and this will not re\nsult from the intention of a considerable J\nbody of citizens to block the experimenc,\nbnt from the fact that millions of citizens\nwho arc heartily in accord with the pur\nposes of NRA will find it absolutely impos\nsible to comply with the conditions.\nThere are millions of individuals and\nsmall businesses in this country that can\nnot fulfill the primary purpose of NRA,\nwhich is to employ more labor and pay\nhigher wages. Improvement in business\nconditions will have to come first, enabling\nthese people to get in financial condition\nto proceed along NRA lines. They do not\npossess the resources necessary to enable\nthem to increase expenses and wait for in\ncreased business. They have no cash sur\nplus and no place to go for money. The\nbanks will not supply capital to be used in\ncarrying on their enterprises while they\nwait for better business.\nNow, in the case of these business men\nand their enterprises, the primary purpose\nof the NRA program, to get business going\non a normal scale, will be defeated by any\neffort to compel them to shoulder impos\nsible burdens and do things which are hu\nmanly impossible. This effort would result\nin the wrecking of many small business en\nterprises and the closing down of many. A\nsmall manufacturer who has no cash sur\nplus and no banking credit, and who may\nbe operating at present at a loss, cannot\npossibly meet increased operating costs.\nTo do so would be to add that increased\ncost to his already mounting losses. Under\nNRA pressure that manufacturer can close\nhis plant. That is the only course left to\nhim. The government cannot compel him\nto operate his plant—either profitably or\nat a loss—it cannot expect him to operate\nat a loss when the money to carry on is not\nto be obtained from any source.\nIf the small manufacturer or business\nman is put out of business, temporarily or\npermanently, bad conditions are made\nworse, unemployment is increased and the\nsum total of wages is decreased.\nOf course, no person in the country, per\nhaps, is so dump as to suppose that Presi\ndent Roosevelt, General Johnson and their\nassociates do not know these things; but\nup to the present time they have indicated\nw> purpose to meet this serious and menac\ning condition. Perhaps the time for action\nin this particular has not arrived. It will\narrive speedily, however; and it is a men\nace to the success of the recovery program\nwhich must be faced and settled right;\notherwise the recovery program will be\nwrecked on the downfall of small business\nin this country. t\nA store in Hendersonville cannot operate\nunder the iron-clad conditions which may\nbe enforced in a metropolitan store. A\nsmall industry anywhere In the country\ncannot meet all the conditions exacted oi\nthe great business corporations of the\nepuntry. The Times-News cannot operate\nunder the conditions proposed for metre\npolitan newspapers and accepted bv some\nof them. The Times-News cannot meet the\nconditions of any code so far proposed for\nthe newspaper business. Many small stores\nI an(i other enterprises have rushed forward\nto sign a NRA code and are going to dis\ncover that they cannot meet the conditions.\nAll that the citizens of the country can\ndo in this emergency is to do the best they\ncan do. That does not mean that any of\nthem are warranted in shirking their duty,\nin hanging back, in attempting to block\nthe progress of recovery. That course is a\nvery foolish one to pursue. We aie all in\nterested in the restoration of improved\nbusiness and industrial conditions. We\nhave common interests. If the country fads\nin this undertaking we all fail together\nThe citizen who exercises nothing more\nthan common sense in this emergency will\nexert himself to the limit to do his part in\nany reasonable way to aid in biinging\nabout improvement in general conditions\nin this country.\nJust because you’re in the red these days\nis no reason to have the blues.\nGovernment is perplexed over the own\nership of a million reindeer in Alaska.\nThat makes it official that there isn t an>\nSanta Claus.\n_____________- . -— •\nNEWSPAPERS’ OPINIONS |\n____ b\nHORSE RACING—RACKET OR SPORT?\nIs horse racking a sport or a racket? Many a\nsincere admirer of the American thoroughbred no\nlonger finds a trip to the race track the thrilling\nholiday prospect it was in departed years when on\nmany race tracks gambling was actually secondary\nto the public’s interest in horses and horseman\nship.\nThe race track has changed. The avenue of\nshade trees in the homestretch has given way to a\ngigantic superstructure resembling a stock exchange\nboard which has become the pulse center of public\ninterest. Throngs that once flocked to the saddling\npaddock to admire the pick of the field have given\nway to hysterical mobs that mill about caged win\ndows where money is wagered on the race.\nSuch is the modern setting where wholesale\ngambling parades in a guise of respectability at\ntained through the widespread legalization of pari\nmutuel betting. This is the much-publicized system\nwhich “protects” the public from the fake odds of\ncrooked bookies by exploiting public avarice on a\nbasis of mass production.\nThis is the system which lured thousands 10\nRockingham Park in July for the first big running\nhorse meeting since New Hampshire legalized pari\nmutuel betting early this year—the system which\nthe New Hampshire Breeders’ Association declared\nwas essential in its efforts to develop the thorough\nbred.\nRockingham failed to attract a single horse\nwhich has figured in any of America’s leading\nstakes, yet the association ostensibly formed to\ndevelop race horses regarded the meeting as a huge\nsuccess—not because of the keenness of competi\ntion, but because it enticed the public in the midst\nof hard times to send move than $5,000,000 thru\nthe track’s pari-mutuel machines in four weeks of\nmediocre racing.\nGambling greed and racketeering go hand in\nhand. Hence, it is not surprising that wholesale\ncharges of doped horses, bribed jockeys and fixed\nraces—insidious things that flourish wherever\n“easy money” collects—are putting a crimp into\nbusiness at many race tracks. One racing expert\nhas recently admitted that betting is falling off\nat most tracks and that “the racing public is be\ncoming jittery.” This indicates that in time mis\nguided millions may realize the foolishness of seek\ning something for nothing and promoters of whole\nsale gambling may discover that they have killed\nthe goose that laid the golden egg.—The Christian\nScience Monitor.\nOUR CHURCHMAN MAYOR\nThe North Carolina Christian Advocate this week\ngives front page editorial prominence to the con\nsolidated live Quarterly Conference meeting in the\nf First Methodist church in Charlotte, the report be\n\\ ing embellished by a portrait of “Arthur Wcarn,\nmayor of Charlotte, and a leader among Methodist\n■ laymen in his city.” Editor Pyler follows this with\na tribute to His Honor, and, for the benefit of\nMayor Wearn’s friends in particular and church\nmen in general, we are passing along the comment.\nSays Editor Plyler—\ni At the close of business, somebody suggested\nthat we have a word from Charlotte’s new mayor,\nArthur II. Wcarn, who is the secretary of the\nQuarterly Conference of First church. Mr. Wearr\nexpressed appreciation for this privilege to say a\nword in behalf of civic righteousness, and it was\ngreat to hear this man, whose life through the\nyears has been an open book which all men might\nread with profit, declare his stand upon all moral\nquestions. Among other things he said that he was\nthe only councilman who voted against the licens\ning of beer and that now with the campaign ap\nproaching when men and women will be called\nupon to take their stand, he desired to say with\nemphasis that he is against the repeal of the 18th\nAmendment and of the Turlington Act, and op\nposed to every move that ministers to lawlessness\nand the return of the legalized liquor traffic.\n“As I heard the ringing words of Charlotte’s\nmayor,” says the editor, “I thanked God that there\nis one man in high public office in North Carolina\nwho is not afraid to speak clearly and boldly in\nI behalf of high ethical standards and of good gov\nernment.\n“If the good citizens of Charlotte fail to stand\nby their mayor, and to see that the hoodlum ele\nment of that city do not take charge of affairs, 1\nshall be sorely disappointed, and shall be ashamed\nof those church leaders in the ‘City of Churches.\'\nIf Charlotte does not keep the unrighteous forces\nfrom the city the church people will be to blame.’1\n—The Charlotte Observer.\nPOLICE!

The expenses\nwere for speakers, field workers,\noffice help, telephone, telegraph\nand printing.\nReceipts, thq statement show\ned. amounted to $8136 and con\nsisted largely of $5700 received\nfrom the national Democratic ex\necutive committee.\nBEGIN BRIDGE WORK\nST.

Paragraph\n7 of the agreement pledges the\nemployer “not to reduce the com\npensation for employment.\nIs the foregoing interpretation\nto be taken to mean that an em\nployer cannot dismiss his help?\nThe employer reserves the right\nto hire and fire in order to make\nhis business more efficient and\nmore successful but he does not\nhave the right to discharge sala\nried employes in order to obtain\nthe blue eagle.\nHow can a one-man store not\noperated by the owner obtain the\nblue eagle when the business will\nnot justify a manager’s salary in\nexcess of $35 a week?\nThe manager could be given a\nsalary of $13 or more a week on\na 40 or 48-hour basis according\nto the nature of the business but\nthis does not provide for keeping\nthe business open longer than\nthese prescribed hours. Some\nmember of the owner\'s family not\non a salary could work the addi\ntional hours in order to keep the\ndoors open or the owner could\nemploy some one on an hourly\nbasis to prolong the open hours\nof the store. Unless a manager\nreceives more than $35 a week\nhis hours are limited to 40 or 48\nhours, according to the line of\nbusiness.\nHow are small business con\ncerns that seemingly cannot pay\ntheir help $13 a week or the man\nager more than $35 a week going\nto obtain the eagle or keep in the\ngood graces of public sentiment,\nwhich may demand the display of\nthe eagle? In other words, is a\nsmall business to be put out of\nbusiness because it is small and\nunprofitable when all the help,\neven the manager, is employed?\nA temporary “stay” or post\nponement has been provided where\na firm can show “unavoidable\nhardship” but little encourage\nment except of a temporary na\nture can be extended. This will be\nexplained tomorrow.\nTHIS ALABAMAN\nIS CLOSE FIGURER\nMONTGOMERY, Ala., AurusI\n15—(UP).—When Henry Hill,\nchief of the tobacco tax division\nof the Alabama state tax com\nmission, makes a guess it’s usual\nly a good one.\nTen months ago, when £hc leg\nislature was preparing to in\ncrease the tobacco tax, Hill ap\npeared before the senate finance\nand taxation committee and said\nthat with the increase, tobacco\ntaxes would bring $1,400,000 in\nto the state treasury in a year’s\ntime.\nFor the first 10 months of the\nfiscal year, which closes October\n1, tobacco tax collections have\ntotalled $1,148,656. Hill figures\nnow that collections for the\nmonths of August and Septem\nber will reach $250,000, making\nthe total $1,398,000.\n“That,” remarked Hill “is\npretty close figuring.”\nliY liUDNfcY UUlC.lltK\nAICA Service " rlter\nierASIIlNGTON.—\'The press con\nWfercnce has become ono of the\nmost important institutions in\nWashington.\nIt never used to amount to much\nHut now it is being taken with\nextreme seriousness by all con\ncerned.\nHoover press conferences were\nrelatively dull, frigid and barren.\nYou wrote out your questions m\nadvance and they might or might\nnot be answered.

WESTALL\nLAID TO REST!\n__\nEast Flat Rock Mourns\nDeparture of Beloved\nCitizen\nEAST FLAT ROCK, Aug. 15. j\n(Special).—Mrs. T. C. Westall,!\nSr., who passed away at her at- j\ntractive home on last Tuesday at\n10:45 a. m., following an illness\nof approximately two years, was,\nbefore her marriage, Miss Nan\nnie Fowler, daughter of the late\nMr. and Mrs. Franklin T. Fowl\ner and cherished sister of Mrs.,\nSilas F. Fowler, former superin- ■\ntendent of the hosiery plant\nhere, and who now holds a good,\nposition with this firm and has\nrecently been welcomed back\nhere as a resident, by his friends. |\nMrs. Westall was born May 5,:\n1869, and was a native of Hay-]\nwood county. However, they are]\npioneer residents of this town, i\nhaving come here May 20, 1908.1\nHer marriage took place April]\n30, 1892. She and her husband,\nwere a devoted couple and 10\nchildren were born to this union, j\nOne son, Charlie, preceded his >\nmother to the grave four years1\nago. The funeral service was\nheld at the East Flat Rock Bap\ntist church, Thursday p. m. near\n3:30 o’clock and was conducted\nby the pastor, the Rev. N. B.\nPhillips, who rendered praises to j\nthe deceased, and related in an\nimpressive manner, the story of\nXlcr CUiivcraiuii, at nit* t*«u i.v\nof 10 years. He was ably as-|\nsisted by Rev. N. A. Melton, a\nclose friend of hers, and former\npastor of the church where the\nfuneral service was held. Messrs.\nMont Ward, John Sinclair,\nPritchard Jones and Clyde Whit\nlock had charge of the singing,\naccompanied at the piano by\nMrs. John Sinclair. They sang\nof “The City of Gold” in a man\nner which produced an effect on\nthe feeling of the entire con\ngregation. Rev. Phillips’ topic\nwas “Faith in God” and he spoke\nof her faith in him and in hu\nmanity.\nThe large attendance and\ngorgeous floral tributes demon\nstrated something of the high es\nteem in which she was held in\nthis county. There were many\nold associates from out-of-town\nwho attended, among them Mrs.\nR. M. Patterson of Asheville, and\nMrs. N. B. Staton of Charlotte.\nShe possessed a wonderful per\nsonality and was ever so con\nsiderate in all instances. Her\nreligious activity and co-opera\ntion with the entire faculty of\nthe East Flat Rock school from\nyear to year should hold an im\nportant space on the pages of\nthe history of the town.\nMore than one denomination\nis bereaved over her departure.\nHer services rendered, as presi\ndent of the Ladis’ Aid society of\nthe M. E. church here, when it\nhad not been established long,\nwere indispensable. Her heart\nwas in the work and as she was\na highly capable leader. Much\nprogress was made by the or\nganization at that time, its chief\nobjective being that of caring\nfor little orphan children. Also,,\nat that time, she taught a bunch t\nof small boys, at the same.\nchurch, who are now adults and:\nwere her pallbearers as per her I\nrequest before death. It is <>b-1\nvious that the constructive ideas,\nwhich she implanted in their\nyoung minds have followed them,\nthrough life. J\nShe was very proud of the(\nsuccesses with which her children.\nmet. Two of her daughters, |\nDonna Belle and Henrietta, at-(\ntended the Asheville Normal aft-1\ner graduating from high school\'\nhere. One of her sons, Scott. |\ngraduated from U. N. C., Chapel:\nHill, with honors. As soon as she I\nrealized that her youngest child,.\nT. C., possessed ability in art, j\nthey managed to send him to the\nJohn Herron Art school in In- j\ndianapolis, Ind., where he grad-!\nuated. During his four xearsi\nthere from time to time, he sent\nhis mother lovely paintings which,\nshe prized very highly. 1\nThe pallbearers were Tommie\nCagle, Delmar Cagle, Boyd Kd\nney, Vernon Jones, Hubert Dun\ncan, Thomas Pack.

Hedge\nSinks Tee Shot\nAs Hole-in-One\nTourney Opens\nNEW YORK, Aug. 15.—(UP).\nOne of the most amazing feats in ■\nthe history of competitive golf i\nwas achieved yesterday when\nJack Hagen, home professional, I\nopened the World-Telegram’s an\nnual hole-in-one tournament on\nthe Salisbury course by sinking\nhis third shot for a hole-in-one.\nJack Doyle, the Broadway bet\nting commissioner, had figured the\npossibilities of any individual of\nthe 400 contestants making a\nhole-in-one as a 20,000 to 1 shot.\nLast year, 217 entrants fired 1,\n085 shots at the pin on another\ncourse and the nearest was 25\ninches away.\nBecause Hagen was the home\npro at Salisbury, he was accorded\nthe honor of opening the tourney.\nHis No. 7 iron sent the ball soar\ning over the 148 yards to the\nthird hole of the No. 2 course. It\nflew straight for the pin. and went1\nin the hole oh the fly.\nThe feat was more remarkable\nbecause Hagen made his drive\nduring a light rain. It was the\nthird hole-in-one of his career,\nan;! admittedly his greatest shot.\nHe is the first golfer in history to\nregister a hole-in-one under offi\ncial observation.\nOf the 156 contestnats who\ntook their five shots yesterday,\nthe last man. H. C. Hopkins of\nSalisbury placed second with n\nshot that halted two feet from the\npin. Nearly 250 more players will\ntry to equal Hagen’s\' feat today.\nJack Hagen is no relation of the\nillustrious Walter.\nToomer Billed to\nPlay in Foursome\nWith Bobby Jones\n.Tack Toomer of Hendersonville\nand W.

Aug.\n15. — (UP). — Crawford (Fish) >\nEarnhardt, 2G, former Duke uni\nversity athlete and noted south- j\nern swimmer, Sunday swam the:\nlength of the Cage Cod canal, •\nthe first time the feat ever had\nbeen accomplished.\nThe swim hitherto had been\nregarded as too dangerous ow\ning to a powerful undertowe\nwhich is increased by the propel\nlers of passing ships. Earnhardt,\nwho is lifeguard and swimming\ninstructor at the exclusive oyster\nharbors club at Osterville, was\nclocked by U. S. government en\ngineers at 1 hour and 34 minutes\nfor the 7.9 miles.\nHe started from the state pier\nat Buzzard’s bay and finished at\nthe coast guard station at Sand\nwich. Using -x powerful Japa\nnese crawl, Earnhardt swam a\nsteady 52 strokes to the minute\nthe entire distance.\nThough a tide helped him\nsomewhat, he had to fight con\nstantly against the undertow.\nSeveral times he was forced to\nswim close to shore to avoid be\ning drawn into the screws of\npassing vessels.\nLater Earnhardt said he had\nsuffered no ill effects from the\ngrind, and announced he woul/1\nimmediately start training for a\nswim from Hyannis to Nantucket\nisland, a distance of approximate\nly 20 miles. No one has ever\nsucceeded in this which is gen\nerally regarded as too risky h«\n| cause of treacherous cross-cur\nrents in Nantucket sound.\nStandings\nSMOKY MOUNTAIN\nVV. L.

Almost every man\nor. both teams turned in a brilliant\nif not sensational bit of work dur\ning the contest. But it was the\nspectacular pitching of J. Bald\nwin. Fletcher’s ace lefthander,\nthat stood out most conspicuous\nly. He limited Valiev Hill to a\nlone single in the nine innings\namt never allowed a man to read;\nsecond base. Only 31 men faced\nhim daring the contest; two\nreached first on walks, and one\ngot on as the result of an error,\nFletcher\'s only miscue. Baldwin\nstruck out seven men.\nOn the other hand, Ermando\nHoratius Cascarindo, working on\nthe mound for the Hillers, did a\nnice evening’s work, but never\nhad a chance of winning with his\nteammates being held helpless at\nbat. Ermando held Fletcher to\nfive hits, four of which came in\nthe second frame, and pitched\nseven hitless innings.\nIn the second inning, with two\nmen down. B. Case hit a home\nrun; Wilkey followed with a lucky\ndouble; Garren singled and Pit\ntillo lucked a double down first\nbase line to send Wilkey home.\nE. Ward flied out to first and\nFletcher’s scoring was over for\nthe day.\nE. Ward was a sensation at\nthird for Fletcher, while J. Case\nstarred at short for Valley Hill.\nIn the outfield. Barnwell, Wil\nliams and Kilpatrick made great\ncatches for the Hillers, while B.\nCase starred in the outer garden\nfor Fletcher. Valley Hill execut\ned three fact double plays in the\ngame—Cascarindo to J. Case to\nDrake—J. Case to Few to Drake\n—J. Case to Few.\nOnly 33 batsmen faced Erman\ndo Horatius Cascarindo during the\ngame.\nMills River 11.

After being held to two\nhits up to the ninth inning, the\nBoylston lads jumped on the of\nferings of the Stevens brothers in\nthe last frame and drove out eight\nhits which netted them six runs.\nH. Taylor was the hitting star,\ngetting a home run, a triple, dou\nble and single out of four times\nup.\nFruitland 12, Balfour 1.\nIn this contest. Fruitland did\nsome heavy hitting to coast to an\neasy win. while their moundsman.\nE. Fisher, was holding the Balfour\nsluggers at bay. Balfour aided in\nits downfall by committing nine\nerrors behind the pitching of\nTaylor. The game was played at\nFruitland.\nE. Flat Rock 7, Green River 6.\nThis game was a hard fought\ncontest between two teams that\nare strong rivals. The outcome\nwas in doubt until the last hall\nhad been thrown in the ninth in\nning. Jackson pitched for East\nFlat Rock and was hit hard at\ntimes. P. Thompson was on the\'\nslab for Green River and pitched\na creditable game.\nIt is regretted that few details\nhave been heard of the last three\ngames so that a better write-up\nmight have been made.\nLEAGUE STANDINGS\nClub W.

Dick takes her to the sta\ntion but throughout the week in\nNew York she has no word from\nhim. The days there are busy.\nShe meets Theron Reece who is\nmuch attracted by her and she\nvisits Irene Prentiss, a former\nschoolmate who is playing the\nstock market and advises Eve to\ndo the same.\nOn her return to Lake City\nDick takes Eve to the fashion\nable Hotel Miramar where he has\nengaged a suite. At the office\nEve finds a new copy writer,\nMona Allen, who appears to be\na trouble-maker.\nDick and Eve are in the hotel\ndining room one evening when\nEve sees Theron Reece. He rec\nognizes her and comes to their\ntable. Later she tells Dick she\nthinks they should move from\nthe hotel.\nNOW GO ON WITHTHE STORY\nCHAPTER VIII\nThere were several columns o1\nadvertisements of furnished\napartments for rent in the Sun\nday newspaper. Eve and Dick\nhad decided to rent a furnished\nplace because Dick was only\ntemporarily located in Lake City.\nThe main offices of the company\nhe worked for were in Chicago\nbut Dick had been in Lake City\nfor more than a year superin\ntending the eonstruction of a\ntheater combined with a huge of\nfice building. The theater was\nto open in March but it would\nbe June before everything would\nbe completed. Dick hoped his\nnext job also would be in Lake\nCity. Eve refused even to con\nsider the possibility that he\nmight ho sent elsewhere.\nl lie urst apartment uicy vimi\ned was impressive. Eve glanced\nabout the reception room and\napproved its furnishings. Even\nwhen she had learned how high\nthe rent was she still wanted to\nlive there.\nI But Dick -would not listen to\nher argument that she could pay\npart of the rent. “No,” he said,\n“we’re going to live within my\nincome and save some of it too,\nbecause I have plans for the fu\nture. It takes capital before any\none can be independent.”\nThe next addresses on the list\nproved equally discouraging. At,\nlast they stopped before an old\nhouse on the opposite side of the\ncity. It stood at the corner of a\nmain thoroughfare and tree-lined\nside street.\nThe woman who owned the\nhouse was a widow. She and her\ntwo sons and daughter occupied\none section of the rambling old\nmansion and the rest had been\ndivided into apartments. Once\ninside. Eve had to admit the\ncharm of the place. The walls\nwere thick and the ceilings high.\nDoorways were arched and the\nheavy ivory woodwork was mag\nnificent.\n“Why these rooms are lovely!\nWe must take them,” gasped\nEve, much to her own surprise.\n“And I think we can move in to\nday.”\n* * ♦\nThey returned to the Miramar,\nchecked out and stowed their be\nlongings into the rumble seat of\nthe roadster. Then Dick stopped\nat a delicatessen for chicken\nsandwiches, coffee, a bottle of\ncream and a pint of shcvbert.\nMrs. Brooks let him make the\ncoffee in her big, old-fashioned\nkitchen. She loaned them some\ndishes and cups and Eve set out\nthe food. It was fun eating by\ncandlelight, she declared. Dick\nbeamed at her. “Tomorrow,” ho\nsaid, “we’ll have a real dinner\nin our first home, won’t we.\nsweetheart?”\n“Why, yes,” said Eve soberly.\nShe had not the slightest idea\nhow it was to be managed since!\nshe had to be at the office until,\nfive o’clock.\nAs she waited for the trolley\nat the corner next morning slm\nturned to look at the house. It\nwas downright shabby from lh«\noutside. Eve was not so pleased\nwith her new home as she had\nbeen the night before.\nBut she forgot all that in a\ntremendously busy morning. At\nnoon she purchased an orchid\nlinen luncheon get but there was\nno time for further shopping.\n“Oh, bother!! she told herself.\n“I can’t do everything. We’ll\njust have to get our meals out\nfor a while.”\nBut when she reached home\n| that night she was greeted by an\n; aroma she loathed—cooking cab\n: bage. In great consternation she\nJ hurried to the kitchen. There\nstood Dick wearing a blue flan\n! ne! shirt with turned up collar\nI and a pair of old tweed trousers.\nHe was grating horseradish. On\nthe stove stood a steam pressure\ncooker.\n“Dick!” gasped Eve. “What\n! on earth—?”\n1 “Take off your wraps, dear,”\nhes aid. \' “We can have dinner\nin a few minutes. Everything is\nclone but the horseradish.”\nEve obeyed. She wanted to\ncry. But she laid the table for\ntwo and Dick triumphantly pro\nduced his offering.\nOn the table was a platter of\nham surrounded by carrots,\nonions, cabbage and potatoes.\nEve looked at it without speak\ning.\n“What’s the matter?” Dick\nasked.\n“I’m not hungry.”\n“Well, that’s too bad,” Dick\nanswered. “Don’t you want to\ntry a bit anyhow? This horse\nradish sets everything off just\nright.”\nEve arose and left the room,\n\' murmuring under her breath,\n! “Oh, this is impossible!” Hut\n! Dick went on with his meal, ap\ni parently undisturbed.\nEve sat in the dark living room\nlooking out at the street. Dick\nJ entered much later. “Oh, there\nyou are!” he exclaimed, turning\nI on the lamp. “Have some candy.\nEve?” And with a smile he held\nout a box of chocolate centered\nbutter creams.\nEve grudgingly allowed herself\none of them.\nDick threw a leg over the side\nl of his arm chair, lighted his pipe\nand went on, “It’s going to be\n, nice to have a wife to cook for\nme. I used to get so tired of\nI hotel and restaurant food that\n| sometimes I’ve taken an apart\n| ment with a kitchenet just so I\ncould do my own cooking.”\n“Instead! Where did you\n\' learn to cook?” she asked in a\n■ low voice.\n“Oh, in the woods. Spent a\n: summer up north peeling bark\nfor a medicine company when I\nwas a kid. Fine training.”\n) “You like the woods, don’t\nyou?” Eve asked, in spite of her\n! self.\ni “I’ll take you up north some\nI time; sec if you don’t like it\n! too,” Dick said in answer. “I\n| used to go up in the fall with a\n! group of friends. Hut that was\n, different. Then we stopped at\na lodge and there were cooks to\n, prepare the food. That was won\nderful, too. IJut you never really\ni learn the woods until you have\n: to fend for yourself.”\n“How much did you pay for\nthat cooker,” Eve demanded sud\ndenly.\nWhen lie told her she gasped.\n“It cooks so quickly it will pay\n\'for itself in gas saved,” he de\nfended. “Hut even if it didn’t,\nthink of the convenience! When\nyou get home at night you won’t\nhave much bother getting a meal\nthis way.”\n* * *\n! Dick thought he heard Eve\nmutter under her breath, “Hoiled\n\'cabbage, turnips, carrots—!”\n“Whgl’s that?” he demanded\nsharply.\n“Well, my mother always\ncooked boiled vegetables .when 1\nwasn’t at home. You might cat\nthem at noon if you like them so\nwell,” she said angrily.\n“Rut you can’t buy a vegetable\ndinner the way I like it, ’ he an\nswered. “And besides 1 was hop\ning to get away from restaurant\ncooking after I married.”\n“What you wanted was a first\nclass cook and not a wife!” Eve\naccused. “You should have con\nsidered my qualifications more\nthoroughly if you wanted a mere\ncook.”\n“Well,” Dick answered slowly,\n“I did expect to get a home.”\nEve had no dinner and she\nfelt hungry. Hence she answered\nsarcastically, “No doubt! A home\nfilled with little cabbages. Well,\nI’ve heard of women who read\nnothing hut cook books but I\ndon’t intend to spend my life try\ning to disguise groceries!”\nDick took a long puff on his\npipe before answering. “I’m be\nginning to wonder,” he said,\n“just what you expected to put\ninto a home when you married.\nWhat were your ideas of the re\nsponsibilities of marriage, any\nhow?”\nEve could not answer. She\nhad thought herself beyond re\nproach. That there might be\nsomething to be said for Dick s\nside of the argument also, she\nhad not realized.\nHe put on his hat and coat and\nwent to the door.\n“Where are you going?” Eve\ndemanded.\n“Out for a breath of air,” he\nt told her.\n“I should think you’d need u\nwhen the house is filled with\ncabbage!”\nHe disappeared without an\nswering. Eve burst into tears\nbut. nevertheless hurried to the\nkitchen and helped herself to\nsome food. She was frightened\nbecause Dick had left her. Her\nmarriage was tak ng on an en\ntirely new aspect. Was it going\nto be the lark she had antici\npated?\n(To be continued.)\nTHOUGHTS OF\nFISHERMAN\nThe best the Walton family\never had in its pedigree was a\nbaronetcy; but Sally\'s folks were\nCrawfords and that was sprung\nfrom earls or dukes hack in Scot\nland. And every now and then\nSally makes me feel it. It’s no\nuse for me to sav the Crawfords\ngot their name from settling at a\nford on a river and catching craw\nfish. and the Waltons lived in a\nwalled town; Sally just asks me\nto look in the genealogies and see\nall about those high-ups in the\nhighlands and T wilt.\nSo that’s why I got mad tin\nother dav. Sally had complained\nlots o times about how hard it\nwas for her to talk to some of\nher school patrons about their\nkids without having the kid* to\nswarm all round so she couldn t\ntalk about anything but weather\nand crops. She intimated that\nsome grownups needed education\nabout keeping kids in their places.\nWell, the other day some of Sal\nly’s high-flying kinfolks came to\nsee us. and they had a bevy of\nnice-looking kids with them; and\nevery time I tried to get out and\nmilk the cows without letting her\ntony people know’ I did it, those\nkids followed me round like calves\nafter a milk bucket. rI hen I real\nized that sense in bringing up\nkids is not a matter of genealogy\nhut of horse sense. I’ve seen that\nlots of times. I made Sally admit\nshe had more trouble with kids\nwho ought, to know better than\nwith those she didn’t expect much\nfrom.\nSchools ought to teach more\nsense about lots of little things,\ni All the sense in the world is not\nin books. 1 road in one school\nbook about Sir Galahad and bow\npolite be was and how he opened\nthe gates for the queens or soma\nthing of that sort; and then I\nwent out and found that some of\nSally’s school kids lmd passed\nS through my pasture and bog-lot\nand left every gate open. I wish\n! Sir Galahad had been obliged to\nkeep cows and bogs for a living.\nMaybe he’d a bad more hors*\n\' sense. It’s all right to tench kids\nto use a tooth-brush, but 1 wish\n1 could get some of them to use\na currycomb sometimes too.

Autrust 15.—The\nopposition to the new school law\nand the declaration that a jrroa^\ner decree of school control\nshould be returned to the coun\nties, as expressed bv Attorney\nGeneral Dennis G. Brummitt *n\na recent speech in Rocky Mount,\nis causing some here to. wotmor\nif the attorney eeneral is ready\nto advocate support of the pub\nlic schools through local taxation\non property. For if the local\nunits—counties, cities and dis\ntricts—are going to have com\nplete authority over the adminis\ntration of their schools, they\nmust then produce the money,\nfor their support from local tax\nation. it is generally agreed. It\nwas apparent that the 1 gen\neral assembly was overwhelming\nly of the opinion that if the state\nwas going to provide the money\nfor the support of the public\nschools, that the state should al-»\nhave control over the expendi\nture of this money. That\nwhy it passed the Grifff’n\nschool law despite the bitter op\nposition of the North Carolina\nEducation association. Attorney\nGeneral Brummitt. State Super\nintendent of Public Instruction\nA. T. Allen and others closely af\nfiliated with the organized edu\ncational forces of the state.\nBut does the present school\nlaw deprive the local commun\nities of the control and supervi\nsion of their schools, as the at\ntorney general seems to believe?\nThose who have studied the new\nlaw are convinced that the local\ncommunities have about as much\nto sav concerning the operation\nof their schools as they have\never had, and that about the\nonly thing it deprives them of is\nthe payment of ad valorem taxes\nfor their support. Here are some\nof the things which the local\nschool boards and school com\nmitteemen continue to do under\nthe new school law, just as they\nhave always done in the past:\n1. Local boards of education\ncontinue to employ the county\nand city superintendents.\n2. Local committeemen con\ntinue to employ teachers, school\nbus drivers and janitors, either\napproval of county boards.\n2. Does Brummit* want prop\nerty taxes for schools.\n3. County and city boards of\nFood Industry\nChief Named\nJames I). Dole, above, owner of\nthe world’s largest pineapple plan\ntations and cannrries in Hawaii,\nhas been named chief of the new\nfood products section in th« pro\ncessing and marketing division of\nthe agricultural adjustment ad\nministration.\nPolice Rout Philadelphia Pickets\n1 the camera clicks, a hosiery mill strike picket—one of 2000 who\nti\'rured in a melee with Philadelphia police—is taken away undei\neducation continue to buy all!\nsupplies, under contracts obtain-1\ned by the state, as in the past, j\n4. County and city boards oi j\neducation maintain all plants,\nfurnish all equipment and pro\nvide insurance.\n5. County boards of education j\nlav out all school bus routes nno i\nselect all bus drivers, subject to!\napproval of the state school com-1\nmission. .\nFrom .these examples it can be ,\nseen that the local school boards!\nand committeemen have just l\nabout as much to do with the ac- •\nministration of the schools as,\never before, with the exception\n| that they no longer levy any\ni taxes for the operation of the\nschools—the state does all that.\nBut if the local boards are to\nhave complete control over the\nschools, which seems to be whal;\nthe attorney general advocates,\ni they must then raise all the\n! money needed for their support,\nfrom local taxation on property.\n\' On a district basis, this would\ni necessitate a district tax ranging\nfrom 50 cents to $4 per $100 of\n! valuation, in excess of present\nproperty tax rates, according to\nthe records in the office of the.\nstate school commission. Of if a\n\' state-wide tax for school suppoit\nshould be levied, a tax of not\nless than 75 cents on the $100\nvaluation would bo required to(\nyield the $10,000,000 a year now\nappropriated for the state sup\npored eight months school term\n—and this tax prohablv could\nnot be collected. For this pas]\nfiscal year of 1932—33. the !•>\ncents \'state-wide property tax\nwhen it should have yielded some\nyielded only about $3,000,000,\n$4,800,000. because it could not\nbe collected. That is one of the\nj main reasons why the 1933 gen\neral assembly abandoned the\n\' property tax plan and turned to\nthe 3 per cent general sales tax.\nExperience had shown that a\nproperty tax could not be eol\nj lected.\nBut as long as the state con\ntinues to provide the money for\nthe support of the publics choois\nfrom indirect sources it is only\nreasonable to expect that the\ngeneral assembly will set up\n| some state agency, such as the\nstate school commission to su\n1 pervise the expenditure of this\nmoney. And that is the only\n; way the general assembly has in\nterfered with so-called “local\ncontrol” of school through the\n1933 school law. The only things\nwhich the state does now, under\nthe 1933 school law—and which\nit has been doing for years in\nthe past—are as follows:\ni 1. Provides all the money for\nmaintenance of an eight months\nterm.\n2. Determines the number of\nteachers, principals, superintend\nents and other employes needed.\no. Fixes the salaries of the\nteachers, principals and other\nemployes, the salaries of the\ncounty superintendents having\nbeen fixed by the gene-al assem\nbly in the law.\nIt is a general law of business\nand government that the agency\nthat provides the money for any\nparticular activity shall havt\ngeneral supervision over the ex\npenditure of that money. So a.;\nlong as the state, rather than the\ncounties or districts, supplies the\nmoney for the operation of the\nschools, it will undoubtedly re\ntain the say-so as to the number\nof teachers to be employed, the\nsalaries to be paid them and oth\ner details having to do with the\nexpenditure of this money. It the\nvarious district and county\nboards were allowed to determine\nthe number of teachers and the\nrate of pay, with the state foot\ning the bill, it is agreed tha\neight months terms would prob\nably cost $28,000,000 a year, aa\nit did in 1929. instead of $16,\n000,000, which the 1933 general\nassembly\' says is all it shall cost\nthis year and next.\nThe only way the local com\nmunities may regain complete\ncontrol of their school affairs,\nincluding the number of teach\ners and their rate of pay, which\nseems to be the suggestion of the\nattorney general, is for them to\nprovide all the money for the\nsupport of the schools from local\ntaxes on property, thus increas\ning the local tax rate from 40\ncents to $1 per $100 of valua\ntion. The prevailing opinion\nhere, however, is that most of\nthe people in the state would\nrather have the state fix he num\nber of teachers and the rate of\ntheir pay and also pay them,\nthan have this additional tax\nburden dumped upon them.\nBANDITS FIRE ON\n2 AT WORLD’S FAIR\nCHICAGO.

IHC. J\nSTAGGER WORK\nRELIEF PLAN\nState Will Work Men Half\nFormer Time and\nPay Double\nThe Timcs-News Bureau\nSir \\VaU°r HnH\nRALEIGH. Aug. 15.--The new\nrequirement from Washington\nthat all workers on federal re\nlief work projects must now he\npaid 30 cents an hour, instead\nof what has been the prevailing\nlocal wage scale for whatever\ntype of work has been done, is\ni going to make it necessary to\nj “stagger” employment on all\nfederal relief work projects,\nMrs. Thomas O’Berry, state di\n! rector of relief, said today. This\nmeans that where a man former\nly was given work six days a\njweek at 15 cents an hour, he will\n\' now be given work only three\ndays a week at 30 cents an hour.\nI “What we will try to do now\nj is to see that all those who need\nI this relief employment are given\n[enough work to net them suffi\ncient nay to provide for their\n! basic needs, but no more, “Mrs.\ni O’Berry said. “For from the\n[start, we ha\\e tried to provide\n! work in proportion to the needs\nI of the individual or his family,\nj Thus, if our investigators found\nj that a minimum of $8 a week\nwas needed to supply the needs\n1 of a particular family, we tried\nto see to it that the head of the\nfamily was given sufficient em\nployment to provide the $8\nneeded. Under this new system,\nwhen the man has earned $8,\ni n\n» . ■ - ■\neven if be needs to work only\nfour days instead of six, he will\nbe permitted to work only the\nfour days and some one else will\nwork the other two. In other\nwords, we are going to handle\nthe relief work more and more\non the case system, regarding the\nneeds of each case or family\nseparately. And in no case will\ni>nv one on relief projects b\'c\npermitted to work longer or re\nceive more pay than their needs\njustify." . .\nUnder this new minimum wage\nschedule of 30 cents an hour\nwhich Washington has ruled\nmust be paid all those on relief\nwork projects, a person working\n8 hours a day for five days\nwould get $12. But only in ex\ntreme cases in which woikois\nhave exceptionally large famil\nies, will they be permitted to\nwork the entire 40 hours a week,\nMrs. O’Berry said. 1\nThe order to pay all workers\non relief projects 30 cents an\nhour, instead of what they had\nbeen paid, made it necessary to\nstop all work projects for the\ntime being. Mrs. O’Berry said.\nThis proved to be a decided blow\nto the manv garden and canning\nprojects which were under way\nin many counties and threatened\nfor a time to disrupt the canning\nwork entirely. But since it has\nbeen learned that this work can\nbe staggered” the canning work\nwill go ahead again as rapidl} as\npossible.\n-We have already put up more\nthan 2.000,000 cans of vegetables\nand fruit from relief gardens\nfor use as food in rebel work\nthis fall and winter,” Mrs. O Ber\nrv said. “We also have enough\nvegetables now maturing in ad\nditional relief gardens to put up\nleast 2.000.000 more cans. We\nmust also do this work right now\nand continue it as the vegetables\nripen, in order to make use of\nGERMAN WAR !\nGUILT DENIED,\nAmerican Historians Are i\nTaking Position In Their i\nLate Volumes\nBy TOM MAHONEY\nUnited Press Staff Correspondent\nKANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug.\n, r nip) _The nineteenth anni\nversary of the diplomatic crisis\nwhich precipitated the Worlt\nWar finds many A™c‘,caLn Y\ntorians in print with books ex\nonerating Germany.\nUpon the basis of Post-"a*\nrevelations of documen s, .\nscorc of writers now contend the\nKaiser’s government was the vic\ntim rather than theinstigator of\nBARNES," FAY DEFEND\n^ “Germany Not Guilty in Hjl4\nis the title of a work by Prof.\nM H- Cochran, of the University\nof Missouri.
