It ia due to an Inflamma\ntion which affects the membrane of\nthe stomach so that it ia eateu away\nby the gastric juicea.\nIn good health, the stomach re\nsists the action of the gastric juicea.\nbut when weakeued, the. membrane\nia badly nourished and the digestive\nfluids act upon it aa well aa upon the\nfood, keeping up until perforation cf\nthe stomach occurs. In advanced\ncases of ulcer of the stomach there ia\nmuch tliscomfort after eating, with\nconstant gnawing sensation be.\ntween meals, pain from the pit of the\nstomach back to the shoulder blade.\nAt the first symptoms of Indiges\ntion, treatment should at once be\nstarted with M!--na.
