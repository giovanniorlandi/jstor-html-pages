Bogan, postal clerk of Me\nridian, has been released.\nMrs. Rembert Johnson bag been\nawarded the prize of f6 offered by the\nWoman\'s Club of Dunant for having\nthe best kept lawn\nNEWS AND VIEWS FROM\nTHE STATE CAPITAL\nBy F. R. Birdsall\nThe hearing of the telephone case\nwhich was in progress some days be\nfore the railroad commission will be\ntaken up again this week, and will\ncontinue for a number of days. The\ncompany is asking for an increase of\nrates, which is being opposed by the\nstate.\nThere is a good deal of talk about\nthe candidacy of Hon. E. S. Candler\nof Alcorn for governor. Parties in\nJackson from northeast Mississippi\nthink that his candidacy will be a cer\ntainty shortly. Mr. Candler was for\n20 years a member of Congress from\nthe first district, having succeeded\nJohn Allen.\nAbsent voters are bestirring them\nselves in order to protect their rights\nin the matter of casting ballots for tha\ncandidates of their choice, for senator,\ncongressmen, supreme court judge in\nthe southern district, and for the 17\ncircuit judges and 10 chancellors\nthroughout the state. Pertfms inter\nested should communicate at once\nwith the registrars of their respective\ncounties, the same being the circuit\nclerks theerof.\nThe Illness of Hon. A. Q. May of\nJackson Is causing a good deal of anx\niety among his friends throughout the\nstate. Mr. May is reported to be af\nflicted with cancer of the liver, and\nhis case is pronounced hopeless by\nsurgeons. He was prominent in Mis\nsippl politics some years ago, having\nbeen railroad commissioner for the\nsouthern district of the state, and\nlater was state treasurer under the\nMcLaurin administration.\nThe two miles of concrete pike lead\ning from the Pearl River bridge east\nin Rankin county, which was built and\npaid for some years ago by Hinds\ncounty, Is being repaired. It had gone\nfor about 8 years without any atten\ntion, and while it had stood up finely,\nthere were a number of holes in the\nsame. It is understood that Kankin\ncounty and the State Highway Com\nmission are spending jointly $1000 on\nthis work, $500 from Rankin and $500\nfrom the federal government. This\nwill be a part of the trunk line be\ntween Alabama and Louisiana.\nThe erection of flagpoles at the old\nand new capitols now in progress is no\neasy task. These poles are of hollow\nmetal and are taller than either of the\ncapitols. Deep holes have been pre\npared to receive the flag staffs, and in\norder to make them durable and per\nmanent, cement will be placed around\nthem. It was found not. only danger\nous to get back and forth on the capi\ntol buildings, especially the new capl\ntol, to raise and lower the flag aud in\naddition the swaying of the flags on\nthe domes of the capitols caused their\nroofs to leak. It is understood that\nthe flags will be raised every morning\nand lowered every evening.\nThere is much activity in highway\nbuilding throughout the state, and the\nState Highway Commission is exceed\ningly busy. The proposed amendment\nto change the constitution so that\nMississippi will benefit by millions of\ndollars appropriated by the national\ngovernment for state trunk highways\nis reported growing more popular ev\nery day. This amendment is neces\nsary to meet the requirements of the\nfederal law, as it places all trunk lines\nunder the State Highway Commission.\nShould the state refuse by the vote In\nthe November election to make this\nchange, Mississippi would not only\nlose a million, but would go on con\ntributing its share of taxation to the\nfederal appropriations to good roads\nto be built in other states.\nKu KIuk Defies Chief.\nChattanooga. In defiance of the\nedict of the acting wizard, E. Y.\nClarke, of Atlanta, the Ku Klux\nKlans of Tennessee and North Geor\ngia joined in a ceremony across the\nstate line near Rossvllle, Ga., wear\ning masks. The Klansmen from Ten\nnessee went to the meeting without\ntheir regalia. It is not known If\nthey adorned themselves after reach\ning Georgia soil.\nCrops Nssd Rain.\nColdwater. This section has expe\nrienced two weeks of extremely dry,\nhot weather and rain Is badly needed.\nCrops of all kinds are showing the ef\nfects of the unusual heat and late\ncorn especially is needing rain.\nRslns Damage Crops.\nHazlehurst. The heavy rains of the\npast week have wrought much dam\nage to the cotton crops and corn has\nnot been helped any by me downpours\nwhich have visited the Hazlehurst dis\ntrict dally\nTRAIN\nCREWS\nMAY\nREFUSE EQUIPMENT\nTHESE ORGANIZED WORKERS IN\nTIMATE STOPPAGE OF WORK\nUNLESS PEACE COMES.\nCONFER WITH PRESIDENT\nBig Rail Unions Join In Complaint\nThat Rolling Stock Is In Danger\nous Condition May Again\nCall Officiant in Parley,\nWashington. Negotiations to end\nthe strike of railroad shop craftsmen\nhave been resumed by President Har\nding and B. M. Jewell, president of the\nrailway employes\' department of the\nAmerican Federation of Labor; W. H.\nJohnston, president of the machinists,\nand J, "P. Noonan, head of the electri\ncal workers\' brotherhood, left the\nWhite House after an hour of confer\nence with the chief executive expect\ning to be recalled later.\nIt was not disclosed whether the\npresident had communicated again\nwith railroad heads whose refusal this\nweek to grant his proposal to give re\nturning strikers seniority status termi\nnated the first settltment attempt, but\nthe strike leaders, in cheerful mood,\nsaid that the proposals, as originally\noutlined by the president, constituted\ntheir "irreducible minimum in seeking\nhonorable settlment."\nLikewise T. E. Wills, J. Paul Steph\nens and Arthur J. Lovell, representing,\nrespectively, the engineers, trainmenJ\nand enginemen and firemen, three!\nthe four brotherhood organizations,\nBaw the president at the instance of\nthe national chiefs of their orders and\nof the switchnions union and present\ned the possibility that grave prospects\nof further rail unsettlements were In\nsight unless the shop situation was\nstraightened out.\nIt was understood that while they\ndid not set up a possibility of sympa\nthetic strikes by their memberships,\nthey declared conditions of railroad\nequipment, locomotives particularly on\nmany roads, was growing to be such\nthat train crews might refuse service.\nNo public statement of their report\nwas made other than that contained In\nthe message from the brotherhoods\' un\nion under which they acted in going\nto the White House, and nothing was\ngiven out officially. They made it\nplain, however, that they made no re\nquest of the president for a conference\nwith the brotlerhood chiefs.\nOfficials of the shop union, though\nInformed ta a degree concerning rep\nresentations made by the brotherhood\nrepresentatives at the White House,\ndeclared they had no connection with\nthe move. Claims that locomotives\nand rolling stock were deteriorating\nwas repeated by the union chiefs and\nheld up by them as the influence\nwhich would determine the strike. All\nparticipants held the belief that Presi\ndent Harding, if he intended to exer\ncise further ruasion on the railroad\nexecutives, would ask no further con\ncessions from the men other than that\nInvolved in his original proposal of ac\ncepting the railroad labor board wage\nawards and returning to work pending\nrehearisgs.\nMr. Jewell and Mr. Johnson called\non Samuel Gompers after the White\nHouse visit and some of the represen\ntatives of shopmen on strike In east\nern territory were called here for the\nweek-end to discuss the strike with\nthe national officers. Mr. Gompers\ngave out a statement which charged\nthat "organized employing and finan\ncial tnterests were rallying to the sup\nport of railroad managements in order\nto make of the railway strike a uni\nfied union-smashing campaign."\nClung With His Teeth.\nMills, S. D. P. L. Prestrelle was\novercome by gas In a 60-foot well, and\nwhen he failed to respond to the calls\nof his fellow workmen, they lowered a\nrcpe into the well with the Intention\nof sending someone down to rescue\nhim. They felt a strain on the rope,\nand hauling It out, found Prestrelle\nclinging to M with his teeth, though he\nstill was unconscious. It was neces\nsary to pry his jaws apart to release\nthe rope.\n, Three Sleepers Burned.\nSeattle, Wash. The lives of 30 pas\nsengers were imperiled, one man was\nseriously injured and several other\npersons received cuts, burns and\nbruises when three slec ers on the\nwestbound Columbian Flyer on the\nChicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul rail\nroad were destroyed by fire near Rye,\n130 miles east of Seattle.\nMRS. BENE B. STERLING\nMrs. Bene B. Sterling, of Little\nRock, Ark., holds the unique record\nof 50 years of teaching in the public\nschools of that city. She was born\nin Vicksburg. Miss., 81 years ago, and\nwent to Little Rock in 1872. She be\ngan teaching shortly after the death\nof her husband, and is still on the job\nShe estimates that she has had 6,000\nmen and women of Little Rock In her\nclasses at some time during their\nschool lives,\nTAKE STEPS TO\nT\nSUSPENDS PAYMENT OF PRE-WAR\nDEBTS TO TEUTONS EFFEC\nTIVELY IMMEDIATELY.\nLAPSE OF PAYMENTS CAUSE\nGermany\'s Refusal To Pay Her Pre\nWar Debts Brings Similar Move,\nBut France Hints at More\nDrastic Steps to Follow,\nParis. Premier Poincare has noti\nfied the German embassy at Paris that\nthe first of a series of measurts to con\nserve French interests against a lapse\nin Germany\'s pre-war debt payments\nwould be put into effect immediately.\nThe notice followed the receipt of a\nnote from Germany, refusing to meet\nthe $2,000,000 Installment of these\nFrench citizens due\' August 15.\nThe first of French measures con\nsists of the immediate suspension of\nall payments to German nationals for\ndebts contracted with Frenchmen be\nfore the war, both in France and Alsace-Lorraine.\nThe offices in Paris\nand Strasburg whiv;h were set up to\nliquidate these debts were notified to\ncease functioning at once and to pay\nno more German claims until further\norders from the premier.\nThe initial measures also Include the\nsuspension of all further payments to\nGermans for German property seques\ntered in France. This property In\ncludes estates, villas, art collections,\netc.\nThe agreement reached at Baden.\nBaden under which Germans were be\ning compensated for the house furnish\nings, stocks, bonds and cash left in\nAlsace and Lorraine also is sus\npended. It was explained at the foreign of\nflee that these first measures taken\nare not penalties fittie strictest sense\nof the woid, but ineWly action to safe\nguard tho French Interests which have\nbeen Jeopardized by the Germans re.\nfusing to pay.\nOfficial circles said that Prance now\ncould await some move by Germany.\nIf Belgium and Great Br. tain, as\nhas been indicated, desired to forego\npayments from Germany on the pri\nvate debts due their nationals, this\nwill have no effect on the French posl.\ntlon, it was declared. France will in\nsist on the payment of these claims,\ndespite any moratoriums that the Lon\ndon conference may decide to grant, It\nwas added, and If Germany does not\nmeet the French demands the meas.\nures taken will become progressively\nmore severe.\nMexico Would Disarm.\nNew York. Mexico would welcome\ndisarmament in South America and\nprobably would herself agree to dis\narm if ruch a step were taken by\nChile, Uruguay, Argentina and Peru,\nGei. Manuel Trevtno of the Mexican\ngeneral staff, said, as he sailed fot\nSouth America\nFO\nPAIN\nSETTLE CHICAGO\nTROLLEY STRIKE\nA. COMPROMISE GIVES 8TRIKER8\nA WAGE OF SEVENTY CENT8\nAN HOUR.\n"AUTO PIRATES" WERE BUSY\nGirls Assaulted After Entering Bogus\nTaxicabs Hard-Boiled Strike\nbreakers Had Begun to Ar\nrive in Large Numbers,\nChicago. Chicago\'s traction strike\nwas settled when the company agreed\nto pay the men 70 cents an hour, with\nan eight-hour day. This was consid\nered acceptable by the union chiefs\nand they accepted it on behalf of the\nmen. Under the rules of the union,\nthe proposition must go to a referen\ndum vote, but this is considered a for\nmality and Is now In progress.\nThe men had been getting 80 cents\nan hour and the company proposed to\ncut them to 65 cents an hour.\nThe information was speedily dis\nseminated throughout the city by the\nblowing of whistles, the screeching of\nthousands of automobile horns and a\nsystem of fireworks signals from the\nmunicipal pier.\nMeanwhile Chicago continued to am\nblecheerlly about without surface or\nelevated cars, making Its way in auto\nmobiles, trucks, suburban trains, coast\nwise boats, bicycles, roller skates and\nhorse-drawn vehicles.\nPerhaps the most serious aspect of\nthe strike was the warning given by\nlarge department stores and other\nbusiness establishments that they\nwould be compelled to dismiss nun\ndreds of employes Saturday, unless the\nstrike was settled or assurance given\nthat it would be settled in a day or so.\nThe great stores have been practically\ndeserted for the last three days.\nOne of the despicable developments\nof the strike Is the appearance In In\ncreasing numbers of hoodlums and\n"auto pirates," who take advantage\nof glrlswho are seeking to get to and\nfrom their work. These "pirates" usu\nally work in bands of three, a driver\nand two men In the tonneau. If a girl\naccepts their invitation to be trans\nported to her work or to her home\nonce Inside the car It is driven to some\nalley or the prairie and the girl is at\ntacked. In one case four of these hood\nlums, evidently intoxicated, shot one\nof four girls after they had refused to\nenter the car. Other cases were re\nported by girls who had been attack\ned and thrown from the cars at some\nlonely spot.\nA thirst for adventure and an insa\ntiable craving for excitement of the\nspectacular sort, Involving the risk of\nlife and limb, accounts for the increas\ning number of adventurers arriving in\nthe city, eager for a Job as strike\nbreakers. These "hard-boiled" veter\nans come from New York City, Cleve\nland and other points, and they are\n"rarin\' " to go. They have no home\nbut flock to any place that promises a\nbattle. Money seems nothing to them.\nThey are scrappers from the toes up\nand they go where there is a fight\npurely from the love of fighting.\nDry Agent Investigates.\nLexington, Ky. State Prohibition\nD\'rector Sam Collins has announced\nthat an Immediate Investigation will\nbe begun Into the report of Ameri\ncan Legion representatives that moon\nshine whisky is being sold freely to\ntubercular patients at the govern\nment hospital at Dawson Springs,\nKy.\nMany Mines Operating.\nKnoxville, Tenn. More than 100\nmines In the Kentucky-Tennessee\nfields, many of which have been\nclosed because of labor troubles, are\nnow operating under separate agree\nments with the union, it was an\nnounced by district union headquar\nters, u\nEmploy War Vetersns.\nChicago.

I received pay as\nmuch clerk for the work performed. While Congress took an ad\njournmeut for five months in 1920, I did no work and received no\nay. Mr. J, F.

Mr. Wa\'l is mistaken in his con\nstruction of my affidavit. It was my purpose then and is my purpose\nnow to state that Mrs. Quin did do her work. You established and\nmaintained in addition to your office in the Congressional Office\nBuilding, another office in your home which was run by your wife.\nI had charge of, as you of course know, the business done in your\noffice in the Congressional Building, and Mrs. Quin worked in this\nffice as occasion required. Letters addressed to you personally and\ncertain departmental matters weie taken care ol by her in your office\nat home. This was her principal duty as clerk. I understood from\nyou all along that the office was maintainod in your residence for the\nconvience of your wife as she would by that means be constantly in\ntouch with the affairs of the home, as well as your official matters.\n1 have read also the statement quoted from letters purposing to\nhave been written by Chisholm and Betts. I know these men were\nnot so situated that they could tell anything about who was working\nin your office. 1 have read quotation from letter of Boren.

E.\nQuin paid Campaign expenses out of taxpayers\' pocket. This is ab\nsolutely false and untrue. I worked for Congressman P. E. Quin\nfor about five months from July 1, 1920 to Dec. 1, 1920 as n clerk\nand received $78.33 per month for my work. This is (he only time\nworked as clerk for Congressman Quin and the only time I ever\nreceived a cent\'s compensation througn Mr, Quin from the govern\nment. I never aecoived a nickel from Mr. Quin himself for any ser\nvicfi. All of uiy work was service for the government in sending nut\ngoyemraet matter. Absolutely none of it was in any matter what-\'\never in the interest of P. E. Quin\'s campaign. I wrcte letters dur\ning this time but they were letters from the Government about sol\ndier\'s claims and (he like and I never stated to anybody anything to\nthe contrary. The affidavit of L. F. Noble dose not state I said I\nI wrote campaign letters for P. E. Quin but it says I wrote letters\nduring the campaign. I did wrile letters during the campain but I\nwas not paid by the Gov\'t, for any work except the Gov\'t, work. I\nwas as such clerk both before and during, and after the campaign for\'\nCongress and the the statement of Mr. Wajl to the Contrary is an un-\'\nqualified lie, without any foundation. The records ol the postoffice\nand the employees of the poMoffice all know Idjd the work of a clerk\nand distributed this Gov\'t matter and that is charge against me is\nfalse in every particular. 1 was not in Washington. 1 was in Brook\nhaven and the work was done here. I resent the bringing of my\nname into this campaign by H. V. Wall aud here and now denounc,\nhis charges as false and untrue. James F.

Noble\nwas not in Washington, but in Brookhaven during 1920. The evi\ndtnee shows that he was rendering no services to the Gov\'t, but was\nrendering his services to P. E. Quin and assisting him to be elected\nto Congress in 1920, and the tax-payers were paying the bill. As\nproof of this statement see the following affidavit:\nState of Mississippi, Lincoln County. ;\nPessonally appeared before the undersigned Notary Public, Mr. L.\nF.

"Last week will\nbe the big business, Judgln\' from early\nreports."\nChacherre pocketed the envelopes,\nlighted a cigarette, and leaned for\nward.

The jaunty words had\nsent terror thrilling Into him. He\nstarted Impulsively to pursue that Im\npudent accoster then he checked\nhimself. Had the man guessed some\nthing? Had the man known some\nthing? Or hnd those words been only\na bit of meaningless Impertinence a\nchance shaft which had accidentally\nflown home?\nThe last conjecture Impressed Itself\non Hammond as being the truth, and\nhis momentary fright died out. He\nconcluded that the incident was not\nworth mentioning to Oramont, who\nsurely had troubles enough of his own\nat this Juncture.\nAs for Ben Chacherre, he sauntered\nfrom the alley, a cnrcless whistle upon\nhis lips. Once out of Hammond\'s\nBight, however, he quickened his pace.\nTurning Into a side street, he directed\nhis step toward that part of thTO\nquarter which, In the days before p\nhlbitlon. had been given over to Id\ncabarets and dives of various sorts\nCoining to one of them, which ap\npeared nyjre \'(Jin and Jtaolate than\nthe-rest. Chacherre opeiffd a side door\nend vanished.\nHe entered what had once been the\nBed Cat cabaret. At a tabic In the\nhalf-darkened main room sat two men.\nOne of them, who was the proprietor,\nJerked his chin in an Invitation to\nJoin him.\nA man famous In the underworld\ncircles, a man whose renown rested\non curious fents and facts, this pro\nprietor ; few crooks in the country\' had\nnot heard the name of Memphis Izzy\nOumberts. He was a grizzled old bear\nnow, but In times past he hnd been\nthe head of a far-flung organization\nwhich, on each pay day, covered every\narmy post In the country and diverted\nInto Its own pockets about two-thirds\nof Uncle Sam\'s payroll a feat still\nrelated In criminal circles as the ne\nplus ultra of success. Those palmy\ndays were gone, but Memphis Izzy,\nwho had never been "mugged" In any\ngallery, sat In his deserted cabaret\nand still did not lack for power and\nInfluence.\nThe man at his side was apparently\nnot anxious to linger, for he rose and\nmade his farewells as Chacherre ap\nproached. "We have about eighteen cars left,"\nhe said to Oumberts. "Charley the\nGoog can attend to them, and tne\nplace Is safe enough. They\'re up to\nyou. I\'m drifting back to Chi."\n"Drift along," and Gumberts nod\nded, a leer In his eyes. His face was\nbroad. heavy-Jowled, filled with a keen\nand forceful craft. "It\'s a cinch that\nnobody In this state Is goln\' to Inter\nfere with us. About them cars from\nTexas any news?"\n"I\'ve sent orders to bring \'em in\nnext week."\nGumberts nodded again, and the\nman departed. Into the chair which\nhe had vacated dropped Ben Cha\ncherre, and took from his pocket the\nmoney he had obtained at the bank.\nHe laid It on the table before Gum\nberts. "There you are," he said. "Amounts\nyou want and all. The boss says to\ngimme a receipt."\n"Wouldn\'t trust you, eh?" Jeered\nOumberts.

Oumberts re\ngarded him with a scowl. "You\'ve got\nthe stuff?"\n"The boss has. Look here, Izzy, I\nwant you to use a little Influence with\nheaoquarters on this deal the boss\ndoesn\'t want to show his hand there,"\nand leaning forward, Ben Chacherre\nspoke In a low tone. Then, Gumberts\nheard him out, chuckled, and nodded\nassent.\nAt two that afternoon Henry Ora\nmont was summoned to the telephone.\nHe was greeted by a voice which he\ndid not recognize, but which an\nnounced Itself promptly.\n"This Is Mr. Gramont? Police head\nquarters speakln\'. You laid a charge\nthis morning against a fellow named\nChacherre?"\n"Yes," answered Gramont.\n"Must ha\' been some mistake, then,\ncame the response. "We thought the\nprints fitted, but found later they\ndidn\'t. We looked up the Chacherre\nguy and found he was workln\' steady\nand strictly O. K. What\'s more to\nthe point, he proved up a dead sure\nalibi for the other night.\n"Oh!" said Oramont. "Then there\'s\nnothing to be don?"\n"Not yet. We\'re workln\' on It, and\nmaybe we\'ll have some news later.\nGoodby."\nOramont hung up the receiver, a\npuzzled frown creasing his brow. But,\nafter a minute, he laughed softly a\ntrace of anger In the laugh.\n"Ah!" he murmured. "I congratu\nlate you on your efficiency, Mr. Fell 1\nBut now wait a little and we\'ll meet\nagain. 1 think I\'m getting somewhere\nat last, and I\'ll have a surprise for you\none of these days I"\nCHAPTER VII.\nIn the Open.\nIn New Orleans the carnival season\n,nH nrnrfuced two la alwara opened by the Dan or me\nTwelfth Night Uevelers soon after\nChristmas, and Is closed by that of the\nKrewe of Comua on Mardl Gras night.\nUpon this evening of "Fat Tuesday,"\nIndeed, both Rex and Comus hold\nforth. Bex Is the popular ball, the\naffair of the people, and Is held In the\nAthenaeum, from here, about mid\nnight, the king and queen proceed to\nComus ball.\nComus Is an assembly of such rigid\nexcluslveness that even the tickets to\nthe gallery are considered social\nprizes. The personae of the Krewe,\nn this particular year, us In all previ\nous ones, would remain unknown ;\nthere Is no unmasking at Comus. This\nInstitution, a tremendous social power\nand potentially a financial power also,\nduring decades of the city\'s life, Is\nheld absolutely above any taint of fa\nvoritism or commercialism. Even the\nfamilies of those concerned might not\nalways be certain whether their sons\nand brothers belonged to the Krewe\n)f Comus.\nHenry Gramont did not attend the\nhall of Proteus on Monday night. In\nstead, he sat In his own room, while\nthrough the streets of the French\nquarter outside was raging the carni\nval at Its height. Before lilm were\nmaps and reports upon the gas and\noil fields about Bayou Terrehonm\nfields where great domes of natural\ngas were already located and In use,\nand where oil was being found In some\nquantity. Early on Wednesday morn\ning Oramont Intended to set forth to\nhis work. He had been engaged to\nmake a report to Bob Malllard\'s com\npany, and he would make it. Then he\nwould resign his advisory Job, and be\nfree. A smile curied his lips as be\nthought of young Malllard and the\ncompany.\n"The young gentleman will be sadly\nsurprised to discover lhat I\'ve gotten\nout from under and that his respect\ned father holds my stock!" he reflect\ned. "That was a good deal; I lost n\nthousand to old Malllard In order to\nhave the balance of thirty thousnnd I"\nA knock at his door Interrupted the\nthread of his thought. Gramont\nopened, to find the concierge with a\nnote which had been left at the door\nbelow by a masked Harlequin, who\nhad then disappeared without await\ning any reply.\nOramont recognized the writing on\nthe envelope, and hastened to the note\nInside. His face changed, however, as\nhe read It:\n"Please call promptly at eleven to\nmorrow morning. I wish to see you\nupon a matter of business.\n"LUCIE LEDANOIS."\nGramont gazed long at this note, his\nbrows drawn down Into a harsh line.\nIt was not like Lucie In Its tone,\nsomehow ; he sensed something amiss,\nsomething vaguely but mostly deelded-\niut of tune. "Eleven tomorrow\n?" he murmured. "That s\nor she\'s to be at the Pro\nteus ball tonight. Most gins wouiu\nnot be conducting business afTairs at\neleven In the morning, after being up\nall night at Proteus! It must he\nvnmethlne Imnortant. Besides, she\'s\nnot In a class with anyone else. She\'s\na rare girl ; no nonsense In her full\nof a deep, strong sense of things\nHe forced himself from thoughts of\nLucie, forced himself from her per\nsonality, and returned to his reports\nwith un effort of concentration.\nWhen Gramont went to bed that\nnight It was with a startling and auda\ncious scheme well defined In his brain ;\na scheme whose first conception\nseemed ludicrous and Impossible, yet\nwhich, on second consideration, ap\npeared In a very different light. It de\nserved serious thought and Gramont\nhad made his decision before he went\nto sleep.\nThe following day was Tuesday\nMardl Oras, Shrove Tuesday, the last\nday before Lent began, and the final\nculminating day of carnival. Henry\nOramont, however, was destined to\nAnd little In Its beginning of mucn\npersonal pleasure.\nAt eleven In the morning-Hammond\ndrove him to the Ledanols home,\nwhere Gramont was admitted by one\nof the colored servants and shown Into\nthe narlor. A moment later Lucie her\nself appeared. At first glance her\nsmiling greeting removed the half\nsensed apprehensions of Oramont. Al\nmost Immediately afterward, however,\nhe noted a perceptible change In her\nmanner, as she led him toward the\nrear of the room, and gestured toward\na mahogany tilt-top table which stood\nin a corner.\n"Pome over here, please. I have\nsomething which I wish to show you."\nShe needed to say no more, ura\n. . . . i ui it\nmont, following ner, iouuu mucu\nstaring blankly down at the symbol of\nconsternation which overwhelmed him.\nFor upon that table lay an mose\nboxes which he himself had packed\nwith the loot of the Midnight Masquer\nthe Identical boxes, apparently un\nopened, which had been stolen from\nhis automobile by tne supposed\nChacherre !\nInsect Makes Its Appearance Suddenly\nand in Large Numbers and Serious\nInjury May Result If Appli\ncation Is Neglected.\n(Prepared by the United States Department\nof Agriculture.)\nNicotine sulphate, when applied In a\nmixture with a dust, has been found\nby the bureau of entomology of the\nUnited States Department of Agricul\nture to protect young cucumbers, mel\nons and related crops successfully\nfrom the ravages of the striped cu\ncumber beetle.

In the coming\nfall the biological survey, In co-operation\nwith the chemical warfare serv\nice, Is planning to make a trial of the\nmethod on blackbirds In the Imperial\nvalley of California. In thut region\nthese birds are said to do at least Sou,\n("JO worth of damage to the mtlo crop\neach year. Because of their feeding\nhabits It is impossible to destroy these\nbirds with poisoned baits, but, as tliey\nroost on the reeds in the marshes, It\nIs thought that they can be killed by a\ngas cloud at night when the wind is\nfavorable. The blackbirds are migra\ntory and return to the same places\nyear after year. It is thought that a\nbig killing In a certain locality will\nprobably free It of the pests for many\nyears.\nArrangements also are being made\nby the biological survey with the chem\nical warfare service for Investigating\nthe possibility of using poison gases on\nsuch burrowing rodents as rats, prairie\ndogs, ground squirrels, and wood\nchucks.\nEntomologists of the department\nhave already worked In co-operation\nwith the War department In testing\nvarious gases on Insect pests of grow\ning plants and those that infest stored\ngrain, but It has not yet been found\nadvisable to recommend anything to\ntake the place of hydrocyanic-acid gas\nor carbon bisulphide.\nThe serious disadvantages of many\nof these new gases Is thut they are\ndangerous or very Irritating to men,\nhorses, and mules, and require the use\nof musks and great care In handling.\n3 Tnr ,\nI1TTHFM\nCABINET\n(. 1U, by W..teru N-wlaper Unlop.)\nF.w people, rich or poor, mate , the\nmont of what they possess.
