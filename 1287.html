disagreeing with other\narmy surgeons that tho mosquito is\nresponsible for the spread of conta\ngious diseases\nDr A M Fornnndez Ybarra who\nreturned from Cuba on Thursday\naftor a service there of more than\ntwo years as a pbysioian of tho Unit\ned States Army is a vigorous oppo\nnent of the contention of tho Army\nMedical Department that tho mos\nquit6 is the only means by which\nyellow fever is propagated\nThin theory is based on the report\nmade by Surgeons Reed Carroll and\nAgramonto who ns a special medi\ncal board of the army Investigated\nthe etiology of yellow fever in\n1931\nDr Fernandez Ybarra is a native\nof Cuba and pursued his medioal\nstudies in this city graduating at\nthe University of New York in 1881\nHe praotised in this city for twenty\nyears during whioh tims he also\noditod a medical journal published\niu Spanish here During tha Span\nish war as a contract surgeon he\nwas with the United States army at\nSantiago Liboney Matauzas and\nother points\nAt his apartmsnts in West Four\nteenth stroot yesterday he said ho\nwas the only native doctor iu Cuba\nwho had the tomorlty to deny in the\nHavana Aoademy of Medicino the\nArmy Departments theory that\nyellow fover is only transmitted by\na spooial kind of mosquito Stogo\nmyia faciat and by tho female\nmosquito of that speaios This was\nfirst contended at the International\nSanitary Oongreas held in Havana\nin February of laBt year\nI disagreed with tho doctors\nthere said Dr Fernandez Ybarra\nand wanted them to show how it\nwas that although thoy had tried\nto oxtirpato mosquitoes as the\nsource of yellow fever in Cuba in\nthe city of Havana alone the dis\nease has also vanished from other\nparts of the island where there had\nbdon no attacks upon the mosqui\ntoes\nIf tho morquito theory be tho\ntrue one I believe that similar mea\nsures should be taken against the\nspreading of yellow fever by other\ninseots for if the dise3e is propa\ngated by ouo psoi the others must\nba equally dangerous fcpurcps\nI do nqt ay tha yellow fever\nmay not be propagated by mosqui\ntoor but I do decy that they are\nthe only source of tho opidomic\nDr Ybarra declared that sanitary\nreforms
