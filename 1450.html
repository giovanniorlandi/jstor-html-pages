The success of such an undertaking wonM\nbe a master stroke in Cennan plotting. It would give\nto the kaiser the absolute supremacy he lias found that\nhe never can procure by the sword.\nIn order to supply money for such a purpose, the\nPrussians need put up enly enough to satisfy the leaders\nlike Trotiky and Haywood. The rabble may be ignorec.\nThere are a sufficient number of Huns in the United\nStates to keep well paid all the I. V.

The unprincipled and ignorant leaders may\npoint the way to treachery and ruin and. as a Hock of\ngeese follows the one ahead, the sinister forces of evil\nwill plun?e onward toward the abyss.\nThe L V.

They\nare satisfied with no wage, tcey defy the laws, the\ntorch ard bomb are the agencies of which they complain.\nThey decry law and ordr. yet, wrenever they are caught\nre-i-handed in crime, they are loud in their wails about\n"constitutional rights." They want the protection of the\nlaw, but they misconstrce law to mean license. This\nelement is twin to autocracy. Each is tyrannical and\nfostered by the ambit ioa of a malignant few. Autocracy\noppresses through the agency of inexorable authority;\nanarchism stifles the freecom of man by a wanton course\nof ruin, rapine and terror. There is no difference in them\ninsofar as they affect t!ie people at Urge. The L TV. TV.\ncan not make any headway in the United States. Its\nmembers are as vipers hidden in a great field with the\nplaces of their concealment known. There are not more\n- than 150.000 of them among this nation of 100.000.000\npopulation. They are marked with the indelible brand of\ntreason, and there is no haven to which they may go.\nIt is not, however, what they can do in this country, but\nwhat in their hearts they want to do. They are just\nas guilty as if they had been as successful as the Bolshe\nviki. and had stripped America bare in the presence of a\nworld of ruthless foes.\nThe I. TV.

He is said to have been\nmarried and his wife earned her living in Chloride. She\nwent to Globe, where the two kept house. Officers have\nbeen on the trail of the pair since the murder of Chap\nman and it is probable that the perpetrators will now\nbe brought to justice.\n"Ollie Lewis, whose machine was wrecked by Barr\nand Scott on the desert, left here Sunday night for Jop\nlin. Mo, but evidently did not go that far, as officers\nhave failed to trace her since leaving Kingman. It is\nevident that she knew the whereabouts of Scott and is\nprobably with him in southern Arizona.\n"The murder of Dave Scott has not been cleared up\nbut his bloody clothes were found in an old tunnel at\nMineral Park by Sheriff Cohenonr.\n"Barr was registered under the selective draft and\nfailed to appear for examination.
