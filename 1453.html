Quigley\nwill deliver to the common council\nthis evening. r. f\nThe message is--rich with sugges\ntions and recommendations, many of\nwhich he promised to try to carry\nout when he was campaigning for the\nrepublican nomination and later for\nthe election. . The message Indicates\nthe belief of the chief executive that\nhe should take the initiative in trying\nto bring the city to a plane equal with\nthe best cities of the land and not\nwaif for others to do it.\nv. Some features of municipal life will\nbe touched on only briefly as Mayor\nQuigley has . not had sufficient time\nduring his brief occupancy of the office\nto go into all phases and branches of\nthe government ; -\n"I am going to talk on those things\nwith which I am familiar,\'; said Mayor\nQuigley to a Herald reporter. "I\ndon\'t intend to go deeply into any\nsubject I have not studied but when\nI get an opportunity to make special\nstudies of them 1 will make reports\nand recommendations to the council\nregarding them. 1 am going to talk\nor. subjects I know about and I will\nmean what I say.". \'\nSpecial Message on Water Department.\nLittle attention will b paij Dy\nMayor Quigley tb the water depart\nment as he intends to makt this the\nsubject of a special message later in\nhis term.\nBetter\' Housing. 1\nConsiderable attention is devoted in\nthe message to the health department\nand housing conditions. As an alder\nman, Mayor Quigley spent many hours\nstudying housing conditions, especially\nIn those quarters- where conditions\nwere not favorable to the health and\nwelfare of tenement dwellers. He\nbelieves that such a state of affairs\nas he found should be prohibited and\nwill recommend better housing con\nditions. :\n\' Another item that could be included\nin the health matter is the installa\ntion of sewers in "pocket" streets.\nAt present ; these streets are not\nsewered but Mayor Quigley believes\nthey should be for the benefit of the\nhealth of the entire community.\nGranite Block Pavement.\n\' More perrnanent paving on streets\nused for. heavy traffic is another re-i\ncommendation. Mayor Quigley believes\nthat granite blocks should be laid on\nsuch streets Elm, Myrtle, Bigelow\nand Park\', streets- which are used\ncontinually-Aheayy Vehicles. A He\ndoes not believe In laying macadam\noi semi-permanent pavement on\nstreets of this nature.\n1 Mayor Quigley does not devote\nmuch space to street lighting as this\nmatter is now under consideration by\nthe board of public w-rks and a spe\ncial committee of the common coun\ncil. "Put Wires in Subways.\nWriting of subways, Mayor Quig\nley recommends that the United Elec\ntric Light and Water company be\nCompelled to \' use the West Main\nStreet subways. He also notes that\nthe Connecticut company has a big\nfeed -wire running toward the city on\n"West Main j street as far as Emmons\nplace. . . \'\nr , Better Car Service.\nPoor electric , car service comes in\nfor a share of \'\'criticism. Poor equip\nment which should be in the\' scrap\nheap is a subject on which he touches\nheavily,\' ,vExtensi6n of the street car\nservice in order that outlying tracts\nof land may be developed will also be\nrecommended.\nytotyv Driven Aerial Truck.\nMayor Quigley does not agree with\ninmt year\'s boprd of finance and taxa\ntion, whirfT\'dia not believe a motor\ndriven atrial truck "necessary for the\nfire department.

It is Mayor Quigley\'s in\ntention to have the city divided into\nsections, which will be looked after\nby the respective fire companies. If\nthe firemen find fire escapes in poor\ncondition they can report to the. build\ning inspector. If they find unsani\ntary conditions in houses they can\nreport to the board of health. , And\nif they discover heaps of waste paper\nin cellars and other conditions that\nmight tend to increase the fire risk\nthey can report to the chief of the\nfire department.

He admitted under\ncross examination that he had known\nRosenthal for fifteen years and that\nthey had had a disagreement six\nmonths before Rosenthal was mur\ndered. The witness denied, however\nthat he had quarreled with the mur\ndered man. It is a contention of\nthe defense that Rosenthal was a vic\ntim of a gamblers\' war. Martin T.\nMantonfor the defense, read the rec\nord of Vallon\'s testimony at the last\ntrial in which he said "We quarreled."\n"Well," said Vallon today, "we\ndidn\'t quarrel. That\'s the truth."\n- Manton asked Vallon whether he\nwas standing on the running board of\nthe murder car with a smoking pistol\nIn his hand as it sped away from the\nscene of the crime. Vallon denied\nIt\nVallon was asked about a statement\nmade by Isadore FIshman, a friend\nwho visited him and Webber in prison\nand who is to. be called as a witness\nfor the defense. J FIshman\'s testimony\nwill be used in an effort to show that\nVallon,, Webber and Rose "framed\nup Becker while they, were in , pris\non. Vallon declared if\'Fishman ever\nswoje there . was a "frame up" he\nwas liar.\nVallon denied he ever had a num\nber o pickpockets "working" in de\npartment stores for him.\n"I suppose you are resourceful,\ntoo?"

George\nM.. Landers\' Main street 7 residence.\nThese land-marks of "ye olde time\ntowne of New Britain" are fast pass\ning out of being and it will be but\na matter of a few years when the\nlast of them will be but -a thing of\nthe dim past.\nConcerning the structure which P.\nS. McMahon has had demolished in or\nder to erect in its stead a new mod\nern and up-to-date motion picture\nhouse, there is a history of interest\nto the public of the city. It was here\nthat. Darius Miller, the dean of New-\nBritain\'s business men, first bega\ntive business.\n-mier Opens Business.\nIn 1850 Mr. Miller, then a young\nman but twenty years of age and in\nfrail health, first opened up a dry\ngoods store. At that time his was the\nonly dry goods store in the city, all\nthe other ventures in that line having\nmet with signal failure. Young Mil\nler and Stephen Strickland went into\npartnership and conducted the store\nfor three years, \' Mr. Miller in the\nmeantime recovering his health.\nBuys Out Strickland. \'\nIn remarking upon the old store\nand its business, Mr. Miller statesr\nwith a twinkle in his eyes, that his\npartner did not do much work and\nafter they had conducted the busi\nness for three years he decided that\nhe wanted to go into business in a\nblock now occupied by the N. M.\nCohen estate. Mr. Strickland was op\nposed to this change unless he should\nreceive an additional salary for his\nservices. As he didn\'t do any work,\nMr. Miller offered to buy out his in\nterest in the store. His offer was ac\ncepted and since then Mr. Miller has\nconducted his place alone. .\n- Was Visited By Indians.\nHowever,. the old. buildingv that has\njust been razed has a history "that ex\ntends far beyond the early days of\nMr. \'Miller, One of its first uses, as\nrecalled by Mr. Miller, is that in the\nold days Henry North used the build\ning as a place where he was wont\nto string beads. These beads he\nwould import from abroad and after\nstringing them in the store he would\nsell them to the Indians\' -who used to\nvisit the place. -\nWas Ijadies Seminary.\nBetween the time that the place\nwas used by Mr. North and was, oc\ncupied by. Mr. Miller, it was used as\na young ladies\' seminary. Mr. Miller,\nwho remembers the school mistress\nwell, \' having known her personally,\nsays that he cannot recall her name,\nbut remembers that she was "as nide\nan old lady as ever was." . \' f\nFollowing the, years during which\nthe structure was used by Miller and\nStrickland, the building has-been9C-cupied\nby various and divers concerns.\nIt has been used as a. store, automo\nbile and bicycle shop, picture gallery,\nshooting gallery and many other\nforms of business house uaittf Mr. Mc\nMahon decided "to erect a hew theater\nin its placets\'- .\'\'ftl\'\'--.
