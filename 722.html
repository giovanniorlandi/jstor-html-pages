Other Giants added two\nmore, but they were not needed.\nMathewson was master to the end.\nOldring, Collins and Baker were un\nable to drive the ball outside the\ndiamond in the tenth and final in\nning.\nAs an exhibition of class baseball\nand sensational playing, the game\nwas all the ideal world\'s champion\nship contest should be. For nine in\nnings the rival clubs bat\'ted without\nan advantage. In the tenth with the\nshades of darkness mantling jthe\npark the hero of the game termin\nated it as a dramatist would stage\na final scene.\nLose Chance\nThe Athletics had a chance to win\nin the ninth and many thought poor\ngeneralship on the bench and coach\ning lines threw away an opportun\nity that the future of baseball had\ncast their way.\nWith the Athletics at bat in the\nlast of the ninth, one run was needed\nto winv Whe Strunk opened with\na single past second, Barry bunted\'\ntoward Doyle, who scooped the ball\nand threw wild past first base. The\nball sailed clear to the stand, while\nStrunk and Barry rushed around the\nbases. Strunk was held at third when\nhe had ample time to score. It was\nWiltse and Mathewson cut down\nthe Athletics\' lone chance, for.\nthree Athletics fell in a row immed\niately on infield taps.\nFatal Tenth\nThe memorable tenth was opened\nby McLean with a single, to right\ncenter. Grant was ordered to run for\nhim and went to second on Wiitse\'s\nsacrifice. Mathewson slashed a celan\nsingle to center, on which Grant slid\ndesperately for home, unnecessarily\nfor the play was not close. Then the\nAthletics raked. Herzog shot a\ngrounder at Collins, who threw to\nBarry to force Mathewson. Barry\nlost sight of the ball and it went\nover his head Mathewson going to\nthird. Herzog reacned second. Plaak\nthen hit Doyle with the ball, filling\nthe bases. Fletcher caught a fast in\nshoot on the end of his bat and drove\nit down the third base line. The ball\nbounded unexpectedly and shot over\nBaker\'s head, Mathewson and Her\nzog scoring.\nEvenly Matched\nAside from the brilliancy of Math\newson the teams were evenly match\ned, though Plank was not quite as\nsteady as his rival in the box, giving\ntwo bases on balls and hitting one\nbatter, to Mathewson\'s solitary pass.\nThe Giants got seven hits off Plank,\nto the Athletics\' eight from Mathew\nson, who struck out five batters\'to\nPlank\'s six. New York had eight left\non bases to Philadelphia\'s ten. Flet\ncher, McLean and Mathewson secur\ned two hits each, a total of six out\nof the seven recorded by the Giants\nBaker was the only Athletic player\nto get to Mathewson for more than\nonfi hit, the.home run hero being\ncredited with two.\nHad it not been for Mathewson\'s\nremarkable exhibition in the box and\nat bat, George Wiltse would have\nbeen hailed as the star\'of the game.\nAs it was his play was such that it\n"brought him congratulations from\nboth players and fans.\nTelephone Girls Leave.\nMiss Delpha Henderson and Miss\nJennie Blaine left this afternoon for\nSeattle, Washington where Miss\nBlaine has accepted a position. Miss\n-Henderson will spend, a short time\nwith relatives upon her arrival in\nthat city. When many of the local\nbusiness men heard of the departure\nof these girls, who have been known\nfor the excellent service they have\nrendered as operators in Bemidji,\nthey expressed much regret. Miss\n^Henderson received many remem\nbrances from businftss men residing\nin the nearby cities as she has had\n-uharge of long distance.\nMakes Charges Against Pastor.\'\nNew York, Oct 9.Austin Newbury,\n^-jesie of the men who followed Rev.\nHsJleck P.

Vanderlip, president of the\nNational City bank of New York, told\nthe senate banking committee that he\nendorsed many important features of,\nthe administration currency bill.\nMr. Vanderlip, however, criticised\nadversely certain points, notably th\nindependence of the regional reserve\nbanks, the character of the note is\nsue plan and the section compelling\nall national banks to become members\nof the proposed system.\nERNEST AUGUST RETURNS\nPrince Rejoins Wife, Daughter of the\nKaiser.\nBerlin, Oct. 9.Prince Ernest Au\ngust of Cumberland returned here and\nrejoined his wife, the Princess Vic\ntoria Luise, who has been staying\nwith the empress, her- mother, while\nrecovering from her recent indisposi\ntion.\nThe reunion of the prince and prin\ncess is regarded here as, a definite\nsign that the recent trouble over the\nsuccession to the throne of the Duchy\'\nof Brunswick was rather a contro\nversy between the imperial chancellor,\nDr. von Bethmann Hollweg, and his\nadvisers, than ^between the Hoherizol\nlern and Gueiph families.\nMANY BUILDINGS ARE RAZED\nCrusade Under Way to Wipe Out\nWashington Slums.\nWashington, Oct. 9.-As part of the\ncrusade to wipe out the slums in the\nnational capital 315 insanitary build\nings were razed in the last fiscal year\nand .1,000 persons were forced to move\ninto more healthful quarters, accord\ning to a report of the board for the\ncondemnation of insanitary buildings.\nThe movement for the betterment\nof the.
