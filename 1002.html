The proposed ordinance, a here\ntofore printed lu the Eagle, except\nthe donation of a block of ground,\nwere paused a amended according\nto the forecast printed In tho Eagle\nlast Sunday morning, with the ex\nception that Dallas street through\nout Its length was excepted from\nthe streets over which franchise was\ngranted for the railway.\nIt was also provided thit the com\npany to whom the franchises were\ngranted or their asslgus must begin\nwork within six months from this\ndate, and that the road and light\nplant must be completed within one\nyear from the time work Is begun,\nelse the franchises are void.\nThe franchises as granted by the\ncouncil are satisfactory to the citl\nsens\' committee with the exception\nof cutting out Dallas street south of\nthe intersection of Baker street. Ba\nker street Intersects Dalit street at\nErnest F. Parks\' residence, and the\ncommittee wanted tbe privilege of\ngetting out of town on Dallas street,\nso as to present the proposition lu\nthe most attractive light possible to\ncapitalists, in order to get the most\nfavorable proposition possible for the\nbenefit of the town.\nThe committee In whose names\nthe franchises are granted expressed\nthemselves to The Eagle representa\ntive as being pleased with the pros\npect now, a they believe that in\nthe main the people of Bryan will\napprove of It, and the auccess of the\nundertaking depend entirely upon\nthe people of Bryau.\nThe committee are in position now\nto treat with capitalists, and will\nkeep the public advised a to devel\nopment. We presume that a public\nmeeting wiil be asked for, at which\nthe proposition will be fully dis\ncussed. Mr. J. Adoue appeared before the\ncouncil and requested that they\ngrant him the power to sell the light\nand water plant, subject to the In\ndebtedness upon it, and the matter\nwas referred to a committee for consideration.\nMEDICOS MEET.\nThr Hundrd Doctors In Session at\nth City of Houston.\nHouston, April SC.

APRIL 27.\nTHE PROPOSED BRYAN-COLLEGE\nELECTRIC LINE.\nAn electric railroad from College\nStation to Bryan would benefit both\nthe town and the College. The\nCollege would have no need of\nbuilding cottages for future in\nstructors, nor riiore dormitories,\nimmediately, because a number of\nteachers and students could con\nveniently room in Bryan. Of\ncourse, an many dormitories an\npossible should be built, but lack\nof dormitories would not mean a\nlimited number of students. If\nthis line is not in operation by\nnext October, it U estimated that\nabout two hundred young men will\nhave to be turned away for lack of\nproper accomodation.\nTo the town of Bryan the rood\nwill mean an increase in prosperity.\nMany college students will live\nthere, and new houses will be\nbuilt for tbem; teachers will build\ncottages there; and Bryau may ia\ntime become a typical college town,\nwith fraternity bouses and all the\nother pleasing characteristics of a\ntown near an important school.\nIn time the streets may be properly\npaved, parka may be laid out, and\nthe town may have a much larger\npopulation.\nIt is well known according to a\nwriter on economics, that when the\nprice of a public convenience is\nlowered there is a more than pro\nportional increase in the number\nof ita patrons. An electric line\ncould make money by charging a\nfare of ten cents from College to\nBryan (five cents lower than the\nrailroad fare); though the regulur\nrate for interurban fares is only\none and a half cents per mile.\nWith this rate, the fare from Col\nlege to Bryan would be rven and\na half cents.
