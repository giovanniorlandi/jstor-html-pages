Enter\nprise. The\'re Coming Back\nNot many months ago the returning\nsoldiers from the Philippines were\nwelcomed at San Francisco with open\narms, not only by the people of the\nGolden State, but by delegations from\ntheir native States. The contrast at\nthe present time is a matter of note by\neveryone who pays any attention to\nthe returning soldier. Mr. Soldier\nnow lands in San Francisco, gets a big\nreef taken in his bank roll and takes\nhis way to his home, if he has money\nenough. The returning soldier is no\nlonger classed as a hero, but i known\nas u "good thing" for the merchants\nand tradesmen.\nOn every transport there arrives a\ncargo of "lobsters, " for that is what\nthe dead soldier is known as by the\nmen who have to handle them. They\nare called "lobsters" because they\ncome canned and labeled. These\ndead soldiers are making more trouble\nthan did the live ont\'s, and only last\nweek the regular wharf hands refused\nto handlo them, and the trai.epc! -tn-tion\ncompanies had to secure the he\'p\nof the long wharf men at Oakland to\nperform the work\nLast week ten putrid bodies were\nloaded into the unoccupied end of a\nmail car at the Oakland pier, this be\ning done before tbe arrival of the mail\nclerks for their run. In a few minutes\ntho clerks detected tbe horrible odor\nand all jumped the game, refusing to\ntake the run with the dead men in the\nother end of the car. The train was\nheld long enough to put them off,\nwhich is claimed to be the first case\nwhere a dead man was thrown off a\ntrain.\nThe people who kicked at the live\nhero are making the city front howl\nwith objections to the landing of the\ndead ones.

This is a mistake, as any\none who has taken trouble to look into\nthe affair can testify. The retail .mer\nchants in San Francisco pay rents that\nwoufd swamp an ordinary business and\nthey put the profits on to pay the rent.\nThe Carson merchants buy from the\nwholesalers just as cheap as the city\nmerchants do and as their rent aud ex\npenses are much less he is in a position\nto sell goods on a smaller margin.\nThere is not an article sold in our\ncity from a shoe to a sack of Hour that\nisn\'t just as cheap, if not cheaper, in\nour city. As for dry goods and cloth\ning, the Carson merchants are selling\ngoods cheaper that! in the city. Fur\nniture and carpets are retailed here at\nsmall profits, aud should a party pur\nchase in the city, the freight will more\nthan bring the purchase price above\nthat asked by the hmne merchant. \'\nThe idea of sending away for goods\nis a detriment to auy community and\nit has in a measure been discontinued\nhere, and if there is a prolit to be made\nit should be turned to the homo mer\nchant. He is the one who helps keep\nthe community al\'ve and should re\nceive the support of every one who\nhas a doilar to spend.\nOgla Nethersole, the English act\nress, has been arrested in New York\nfor playing "Sapho.

Carson enjoys the\nunique distinction among cities of not\n"pretending" to anything. We don\'t\n\'pretend\'\' to frown down prize-fighting\nas in Sau Francisco and every other large\ntown in California where there is a fight\nabout once a week. There has been no\nless than sixty fights in California since\nwe had the last one here and nearly\nevery one of them has been a fake to\nrob the public. We have ery few of\nthese affairs in this State but when we\ndo you can rest assured that you will\nwitness a genuine and not a "fixed"\nfight. We have them open and above\nbrd and on the level and the sports\nw ho want to job the public and rob the\nporting element steer very clear of Car\nsou and its legalized prizefights.\nThey are obliged to go to the respeeta-\nie atmosphere of California where every\nthing is fixed in advance from a Sena\ntorial contest to a horse race or a will\ncontest.
