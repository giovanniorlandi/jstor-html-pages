S. Spauldiug, tcpresentiug the plantation has not entered into\nany contract with the prospective settlers for grinding of their cane and\nuntil a satisfactory and unequivocal urjieemcut to that effect can he nr-\nranged, it seems likely that the proposition may fall through. A board\nof appraisers appointed by the Commissioner of Publjc Lnnds has placed\na very low valuation upon the land, with a view of inducing the Russian\n\'settlers to locate permanently upon it. Their report has been given to\nCommissioner Piatt, but ils contents will not be disclosed.\nGovernor Carter is heartily in sympathy with the movement and it is\n1 claimed is doing all he can to further negotiations to an amicable settle\n(incut. On the other hand it is conteulcd by Jas. B. Castle, who repre\nisents the Russian settlers, that unless a contract can be drawn up secur\ning to the planters a market for their cane at a reasonable figure and at\nI the time for harvesting, it is better that the land remain idle or in the\nhands ot the present lessee, which ts the Makee Sugar Co.\nUnless such a grinding contract be assured to the Molokaus, the\ngovernment cannot offer them an acceptable proposition for settling upon\nthe lands. Governor Carter disclaims iiiy power in the premises to\ncompel the plantation to enter into such a contract.\nThe Makee Sugar Company holds from the goveimcnt from 3,000 to\n4,000 acres, under lease which expires in about eighteen mouths. In the\nlatter part of November, Captain Demons representing the Molokaus, a\nRussian sect not unlika the Quakers, investigated the possibilities of\nsettlement of cane land by his countrymen. Providing the Makee Sugar\nCo. would cancel a certain tract of govei.nent laud and to take the cane\ngrown by the settlers, Captain Demons proposed to bring to Kauai a\ncolony of about 130 families, or between Soo and 1000 people, who\nwould become permanent settlers.\nIt is stated that these people are the v cry best kind of settlers. They\nwill make their homes here and will spunl their money here. It will not\nbe sent back to Russia, as the Japanese send theirs to Japan. The idea\nis to have them take up the laud ns a settlement association in tracts of\nabout 40 acres to each family. About half of it is suitable for cane cul\ntivation and the rest can be used for ether agricultural purposes. It\nwill, if the plan is carried through, be opened on the purchase lease\nsystem, so they will be able to spend the first money they make on im\nprovements and pay for the land later on. These men arc not paupers,\nbut have money with which they can make a good start.\nOwing to the disagreement between the plantation and the Russians\'\nrepresentatives the plan seems likely to fall through.\nCHARLES WILLIAMS,\nAuctioneer.\nDated Honokna Dec. 13th, 1905. 8-3\nPresident Against Jap Exclusion.\nSeveral Califomians called on the .\'.e\'ent, among them one or two\nmembers of the California Congressional delegation, says the dan Fran\ncisco Chronicle.

We understand that a\ncommittee is coming here with the intention of having a similar bill\nintroduced by a Democrat, who will try to make it appear that the\nregular delegation is opposed to the anti-Japanese sentiment in Cali\nfornia." "Who are these people?" asked the President.\n"Well, the committee is headed by Mr. Livemash, and other mem\nbers." -\n"Send them to me! Send them to me!" exploded the President,\ngritting his teeth and pounding the desk with his fist. "I\'ll veto the\nbill and deport Livcrnash!"\nThe Califomians promised to suggest to I.ivemash and his associates\nthat they call at the White House.\n"Send them to me!" shouted the President, as the Califomians de\nparted, "I\'ll tell them what I think of Japanese exclusion."\nIt is said Senator Perkins intended to introduce a bill identical with\nMcKinlay\'s bill, excluding the Japanese and Koreans, but when he\nheard of the President\'s threat to deport Liveruash he concluded to let\nthe House wrestle with the subject.\nSpeaker Cannon met ex-Representative Loud.

Loeben\nstein to be Hawaii\'s representative\non the delegation, which it is pro\nposed to send to Washington in the\ninterest of legislation securing to\nthe Territory seventy-five per cent\nof the federal revenues, is a judi\ncious choice. Mr. Loebcnstcin is a\nman among men and his long resi\ndence in the Islands and his famil\niarity with matters affecting the\ngrowth and prosperity of the Terri\ntory, makes him especially fitted\nfor the duties which the committee\nundertakes.\nECHOES OF THE PRESS.\nThe last attempt at securing as\nsisted white labor for the cane fields\nfrom Porto Rico was not a success\nand it is therefore unlikely that a\nnew supply from the West Indies\nwill be attempted. On the other\nhand the Portuguese have proved\nthemselves a reliable and thrifty\nclass of labor and it would seem to\nbe good policy to try to attract\nsome of the immigrants from Por\ntugal proper as from Madeira and\nthe Azores. The laborers of that\nnationality brought to the Islands\nin former years, have proved to\nbe of.au eminently home building\ntype, and that is the class of immi\ngrants that the Territory is in need\nof.

In Ililo recently the county attor\nney refused to make up the budget\nfor consideration of the board\nand denied the board\'s right to\ncompel him to do so.

And the man who helps\nto circulate a slander is as bad as\nthe one who originates it. No con\nstraint is put upon a man to act\nthus.

People\nwho are given to scandal are not\nthe most perfect, but are the most\ntransparent in their actions.\nIt is often to hide their own de\nfects that they endeavor to be\nspatter their neighbor\'s character.\nIf you go back far enough into the\nhistory of such man or his family,\nyou will find some "skeleton in the\ncupboard" that had better be kept\nout of sight.

I do not suppose there\nis one-tenth of an ounce of radium\nin the whole world. If you can\nimagine getting that amount of\nradium, together it would supply\nmore energy than 250 tons of dyna\nmite. Few persons who talk about\nradium and its components realize\nthe great scarcity of the raw ma\nterial for yielding radium or the\nexceedingly minute particles used\nin tlie experiments that nave\nastounded the world. It is impos\nsible to say where the future sup\nply of raw material is to come from,\n1 believe that in America carnotite\nlooks promising as a basis for it.\nCleavite, a mineral found in Nor\nway, is also looked upon as a\nfavorite source of supply.\nthe boring tool is pushed against\nthe mass of salt, and the auger is\ngot in motion; and in a minute or\ntwo so rapidly does the tool work\na hole about five inches in dia\nmeter is made in the formation the\nentire length of the auger. Then\nanother hole is drilled parallel with\nthe first, and another until the pile\nhas been undermined, so to speak,\nwhen its contents can be broken\nout.

However, he\nsummoned the lenders of the Masonic\nHall Association nud tnndc known to\nthem his decision after careful considera\ntion, to accept the ofTer of exchange of\nthe Masonic lot for n portion of Lot C.\nThe Masons ask for lot having a frontage\nof seventy five fret on Waianucuuc street\nand one hundred feet on Hridge street, at\na valuation fixed by the Governor of\nninety cents per square foot. This means\nthat the lot is valued at 6,750.\nIn exchange for this lot, the Masonic\nHall Association propose to give title to\ntwo lots on upper Waianucuuc street.\nThese are the Hitchcock and Masonic\nlots valued respectively at ft, 300 and\n$5,000. The balance will have to be paid\nin cash. The Association agree to put\nup a substantial Mason Hall on the new\nly acquired land at a cost of not less than\n$15,000 within eighteen months from\nJuly first next.\nThe arrangements were eminently\nsatisfactory to the Governor, nud alter\nsecuring the agreement from the Masons\nin writing, he gave instructions to F.u\ngineer Gere to advertise for the removal\nof the Riverside School to the new school\nlots. It is hoped the school building can\nbe removed during the holidays and not\ndisturb the daily attendance of pupils.\nAs soon as the specifications are drawn\nup for the high school, contracts will be\nlet for the construction of that building\non the Riverside lot.\nA Christians Souwulr.\nOne of the most artistic productions\nthat has ever come from an island press\nIs the Christmas number of the Paradise\nof the Pacific.

The passage I y Congress of\nan act under which the Secretary\nof the Treasury shall cause to he\nset aside for a period of twenty\nyears 75 per cent, of the customs\nand internal revenues from Hawaii,\nto he used in Hawaii as may be\ndirected by Congress lor tne ioiiow-,\ning purposes, to wit, the erection j\nof educational and Federal public (\nbuildings, harbor improvements\'\nand Federal military and naval j\ndefenses. 1\n2. An act clearly defining the\njurisdiction of the Circuit Courts\nin Hawaii in reference to their\npower of naturalizing aliens and\nlegalizing their previous actions in\nthat respect, by amending section\n100 of the organic act.\n3. The amendment of the\norganic act so as to confer upon\nthe Governor the power of suspen\nsion or removal between sessions of\nthe Senate of any appointed officer;\nalso the removal of the restrictions\non leasing agricultural lands, and\nthe providing for annual instead of\nbiennial sessions of the Legislature.\n4. The modification of the im\nmigration laws, providing for an\nincrease of population so as to de\nvelop the resources of the Territory\nto the fullest extent.\nThe Territory\'s finances are in\nexcellent condition, says Governor\nCarter in his annual report, and\nthe great reduction made in expen\nditures during the special session\nof the Legislature in 1904 is ow\nbeing appreciated.\nThe fiscal year ended June 30,\n1905, shows a most favorable\nbalance, and for the second time\nsince annexation the expenditures\nhave been kept within the \'income.\nDuring the twelve months cover\ned by the repot t it is stated that\nthe current receipts of the Terri\ntory have exceeded the obligations\nincurred during that period by\nJ86.849.91 and, figuring on a con\nservative basis that the floating\nindebtedness of $576,630.79 out\nstanding at the close of the above\nmentioned period will all be paid\nduring the present year, it is be\nlieved that on June 30, 1906, there\nwill be a cash balance in the\ntreasury.\nIn this connection, the Governor\nstates, it is but just to Hawaii to\npoint out that since annexation the\nthe contributions, made by this\nTerritory to the Federal Govern\nment from customs revenues alone\nhave amounted to $6,059,171.51.\nThis is more than half as much\nagain as the entire debt of the\nRepublic of Hawaii which the\nUnited States assumed at that time.\nConsidering that the area of the\nTerritory is only 6640 square miles,\noccupied by 155,000 people, it is\ndifficult to realize how Hawaii has\nbeen able to stand such a strain\nupon its resources. Under these\ncircumstances the people urge their\nclaims for liberal appropriations for\npublic buildings, improvement of\nharbors, and for lighthouses as be\ning just. Any improvements re\nquested in the interest of harbors\nand lighthouses are for the benefit\nof the American navy and Ameri\ncan commerce as much as for the\nislands, which arc becoming more\nand more an important factor in the\ngrowing development of trans\npacific trade.\nI\'IKANCItS.\nThe assessed value of taxable\nproperty on January 1, 1904, was\n$123,898,504, divided as follows:\nHeal estate, $63,51 6,879; personal\nproperty, $60,381,525, while the\nassessable value of the property on\nJanuary 1, 1905, was, real estate,\n$67,509,036, personal property,\n$66,415,064, aggregating $133,924,\n100, showing an increase over the\nprevious year of $10,025,596. The\ntotal revenues of the Tenitory, in\ncluding a cash balance on July 1,\n190.1, of $56,613.29, aggregated\n$2,411,42631 on the 30th of June,\n1905. The total disbursements\nduring that period amounted to\n$2,988,057.10, leaving a net cur\nrent indebtedness July t, 1905, of\n$576,630.79.\nThe bonded indebtedness of the\nTerritory on June 30, 1904, was\n$2,185,000. during the past year\nthis was further increased by the\nsale of one thousand ,yt per cent.\n$1000 bonds, at a premium of onc\ntciith of 1 per cent, and decreased\nby the payment of 5 per cent, bonds,\namounting to $48,000, thus making\na total of the bonded indebtedness\nof the Territory of $3,137,000, an\namount not exceeding ixi percent,\nof the taxable property of the\nTerritory.\nrunuc LANDS.\nThe public lands of the Territory\nof Hawaii comprize about 1,720,000\nacres. Of this total there arc some\n500,000 acres which may be classed\nas barren. Under the classification\nof grazing and forest land are in\ncluded only about 220,000 acres of\nso-called first class agricultural\nland. Receipts from the depart\nment of public lands for the year\nended June 30, 1905, were $168,\n394.73, as against $143,373-46 for\nprevious year.\nIn the administration of the public-land\nlaws an effort has been\nmade to dispose of unfinished busi\nness and to institute an up-to-date\nsystem in handling all land matters.\nThe cases of those settlers who ap\npeared to have forfeited their hold\nings through noncompliance with\nconditions of agreements have been\ntaken up and examined, and all\nagreements canceled in the cases of\nthose who have willfully violated\nthe law, and the land which has\nthus reverted to the control of the\nTerritory has been again opened\nfor settlement; on the other hand,\nthe right to cancel has been waived\nfor the time being in the cases of\nthose who have failed to comply,\nbut have shown that this failure was\nbrought about by conditions beyond\ntheir control.\nA new feature of the work is the\ncutting up of sugar lands that have\nbeen planted for years under leases\nby various corporations, some of\nwhich are now expiring. The\nopening of these lauds must neces\nsarily be proceeded with in a cau\ntious manner. They have a mar\nket value from $40 to $150 per\nacre, and there is, therefore, a great\ndemand for them. The applicants,\nin a large majurity of cases, have\nno means with which to keep the\nlaud under cultivation; this is no\ninconsiderable item, for sugar cul\nture as conducted in this Territory\nrequires from $150 to $200 outlay\nper acre before the crop can be\nmatured.\nThere has been considerable com\nplaint at the attitude taken by Ter\nritorial officials in reducing the\narea open for settlement to small\ntracts of from 25 to 50 acres, ac\ncording to the quality of the land,\nbut it should be borne in mine that\nthe average cane land requires the\nconstant attention of one man for\nevery seven acres, and often the ap\nplicant, who considers he has been\nmistreated unless he allotted from\n75 to 100 or more acres, is absolute\nly ignorant regarding cane culture,\nor he proposes to depend on Ori\nental labor to cultivate it. Some\ntimes he does not propose to culti\nvate it at all simply to get pssses\nsion, to sell out at the best price\npossible. These conditions show\nthe difficulty of administrating the\nlaiid service judiciously.\nTlie Governor expresses the opin\nion that there is nothing in the law,\nwhich covers the Territory, that is\na greater hiuderaiice in developing\nlands and retarding progress U1..11\nthis limit of time in which agrici -tural\nlands can be leased. Thou\nsands of acies of what should be\ngood agricultural land, pioduciii),\ncrops of some kind, ate covered b\na thick jungle of weeds. Land that\nis under cultivation, if left idle,.is\nsoon taken possession of by a\ngrowth of vegetation which is tin\nequaled elsewhere, and the cost of\nclearing this land is often from $20\nto $80 tier acre. This expense is\npractically prohibitive to the pro\nspective settler without funds, and\nthose with means will not take\nsuch lands under a five-year lease,\nfor at best they can get off but two\ncrops before the lease expires and\'\ntne laud leaves their control. I-ew\nhave sufficient means to purch isc\nthe land outright and carry them\nselves through until they can\nsecure returns from their crops;\ntherefore much of the land lies idle,\nof no use to anyone.\nASIATICS.\nThe , population according to\nnationality, as per latest census\n(1900), was 154,001 Hawaiian,\n29i7s7! part Hawaiians, .7848;\nwhites, 26,252; Chinese, 25 762;\nJapanese, 61,115; other foreigners,\n3237. From the foregoing it ap\npears that of the total population\nthe Hawaiians and part Hawaiians\nform 24 percent.; the Asiatics, 56\npercent.; the whites, 17 percent.,\nand the remaining foreigners, 3 per\ncent.\nOf the total population, as stated\nabove, 63,216, or 41 per cent., were\nborn in this country, and of tlii\nnumber 8902 are of Asiatic parent\nage. Of the entire number of\nHawaiian-bom Asiatics about 548s\nwere bom since the annexation of\nthese islands to the United States,\nand are therefore eligible to citizen\nship. Add to these the number of\nAsiatic children whose parents were\ncitizens of the Monarchy and of the\nRepublic, and there are about 6000\nAsiatics possessing the inceptive\nright of American citizenship.\n1\'UIII.IC SCHOOLS.\nThe total enrollment in all the\nschools according to nationalities\nfor the year 1905 was as follows:\nHawaiians, 4,972; part Hawaii\nans, 3,284; whites, 5,906; Japanese,\n3,609; Chinese, 1,985; other\' for\neigners, 650; total, 20,406.\nThe great increase in enrollment\non the part of the Japanese and\nChinese is due in part to the fact\nthat a great number of the children\nof this class of the people are just\nbecoming of school age, and in part\nto the fact that the Japanese and\nChinese put their children into\nschool just as soon as the law per\nmits, and in many cases these\nchildren are enrolled before they\nreach school age.\nThe total number within scjiool\nage, as nearly as can be ascertained,\n\'s J9i374. and the percentage of ths\ntotal population within school age,\nenrolled in school, was 91.6 pel\ncent.; the average daily attendance\nof the enrolled pupils in public\nschools, 87 per cent.; the average\nwages of the teachers in such\nschools per month, $51.\nCOMMI\'.RCK.\nCommercial statistics of the Ter\nritory for the fiscal year ended June\n30, 1905, are extremely satisfactory.\nWhile a decrease of approximately\n$1,000,000 is shown in the value\nof imports, there is an increase of\njn, 000,000 in the value of exports,\nmaking a net gain of $12,000,000\nin the trade balance for the year.\nIn the trade with the mainland\nthere has been a decrease of $2So,\n000 in the value of goods imported;\non the other hand, the value of ex\nports has increased from $25,133,\n533 to $36,114,985. Nearly the\nwhole of this gain of $11,000,000\ncan be attributed to the higher\nprice paid on sugar.\nI\'UHI.IC IIKAI.TII.\nThe general health of the Terri\ntory has been excellent, there hav\ning occurred 2,640 deaths in a pop\nulation of 154,201, equaling an an\nnual death rate of 17.14 per thou\nsand inhabitants.\nNATURALIZATION.\nDuring the year some question\nhas been raised as to the jurisdic\ntion of the Territorial Circuit\nCourts in naturalization matters,\nand the effect has been to reduce\nthe number of residents capable of\nserving as jurors. It is clearly\nwithin the power of Congress, who\never, to remedy the evil in question\nby allowing aliens to be naturaliz\ned by any court ot record having\ncommon law jurisdiction when\nsuch aliens comply with the con\nditions and provisions of the Unit\ned States statutes.\nThe Governor also recommends\nthat Congress appropriate for the\nfollowing purposes, to wit: To con\ntinue the work of dredging the\nHonolulu harbor; for lighthouses;\nfor better protection 10 commerce;\nan appropriation for the condem\nnation of private fishing rights n\nIluwaii; for two additional judge,\nin the Supreme Court; for refund\ning to the Territory the sums ex\npended between June 14, 1900, ami\nDecember 30, 1904.\nWhat\nPLENTY\nr"J\nNow for the folks right here near your own vine and fig\ntree.
