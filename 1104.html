N. Haskell\ngovernor-elect of JOklahoma, at\nthe Lee Hotel last evening. "I expect\nthis will not be later than the middle\nof November. Do you know that there\nare a great many things that the gov\nernor of a state has to find out before\nhe goes Into office, if he means to look\nafter the people\'s interests as he\nshould," continued the future gov\nernor. "I hava established my head\nquarters at Guthrie and am now busy\ntrying to find out as much as I can\nabout the business affairs of the new\nstate before I am sworn in. I appre\nhend that a good many questions of\nvital interest will arise for settlement\nIn the first three months after I take\nthe oath of office, and.\' I want to be\nprepared to give a proper answer to as\nmany of them as I can."\nDuring the day Mr. Haskell was\nkept busy by numerous friends who\ndesired to congratulate him on his\nsuccessful candidacy, and now and\nthen by some one who has his eye on\nsome nice fat plum which he imagines\nthe governor will be able to help him\nto. \'\n"I have made no appointments, and\nwill make no announcement of any\nuntil after I am sworn in as governor,"\nsaid Mr. Haskell. "The storks that\nhave been afloat concerning certain\nappointments that I hare decided to\nmake as absolutely without founda\ntion. I have other matters of import\nance to occupy my mind, and I will\ntake up the matter of the few places\nI shall have to fill, when the time ar\nrives and I have the authority to fill\nthem."\nit\nUBl I\'ll\' KILLED"\nSheriff Mooney Accidently Drops a\nGun and it Discharges Killing\n\' Him Almost Instantly.\nHoldenvifle, I. T., Oct. 5 Eugene\nMooney, sheriffjof Baxter county and\nwho lives in Mountains Home, was\nalmost instantly killed here today. Tn\ncompany with his cousin, J. II. Con-\nley, deputy sheriff, he was bringing\na prisoner, Bill Estes, from Albur\nquerque, N. M., on a charge of\nburglary. Enroute they stopped over\nat McLoud, Oklahoma, where lives a\nbrother of Mooney.\nwnen kock island train No. 48, on\nwhich the sheriff and the prison were\ntraveling, pulled into Holdenville,\nMoney, who was sittion on the same\nseat with the prisoner leaned over to\nlook out of the window. In doing so\nit is supposed his gun, a Colt\'s 44,\nwhich was suspended from his braces,\nleu on trie noor or the car and was\ndischarged. The ball entered the\nbase of the heart and was imbedded\nundt r the right shoulder blade.\nMooney sank to the floor and as his\ndeputy who occupied the next seat\nback, raised him up, :ie exclaimed,\n"Oh, Lord, I\'m killed." He tried to\nspeak but death came quickly.\nMooney\'s gun was picked up off the\nfloor of the car and on being examin-\nedwas found to have a load in each\nchamber except the one which the\nhammer rested on. It was suggested\nthat the prisoner might have pulled\nthe gun from the sheriff and iho"\nwhile he was stooping oyer, but this is\ndiscredited and all circumstances\nseem to point to an accident.\nThe dead man\'s relatives were im\nmediately notified. He was 130 years\nold and leaves a wife and seven chil\ndren.\nTry An Experiment.\nIt has been said that the man or\nwoman who can read all of the want\nads in a newspaper without finding\none that stirs a little personal inter\nest, or appeals to him or her in any\nway, is without human interest or\nneeds.\nWberher or uot this is true, it may\nprove an interesting experiment for\nanyone, not already in the habit of\nreading the classified ads, to look over\nthem carefully for one day. It may\nhelp you to learn how far you may\nhave drifted from "the ways of the\nworld" how far aloft you may\nbe living from the small oc\ncasions and affairs of the day\'s life.\nWatch the classified ads in the .Chieftain.\nA .,\' J,\nCoarts are watersheds in fact as well as in name.

"Just looking around," ha ex\nplained. "Wouldn\'t you like to look\nat our new line of postal cards?" sug\ngested the eager clerk.

He speedily got ac\nquainted with the editor of the "local\npaper," and they repaired to a shanty\nmade of hemlock slabs (where did the\nhemlock come from?) where the edit\nor, with true journalistic courtesy,\nwhich age doth not wither nor custom\nstale, asked the visitor what he would\nhave.\nThe latter evidently belonged to the\nW. C. T. U., for he called for a lem\nonade. Whereupon, the editor rushed\nhim out of the place into a secluded\nspot, and said, hoarsely:\n"Don\'t you know it\'s as much aa\nyour life Is worth to ask for such a\ndrink In this town?
