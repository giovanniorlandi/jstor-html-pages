During the war years the\npatriotic woman thought only of serv\ning her country and doing so In the\nmost suitable dress that she could find.\nThen came the period of wild ex\ntravagance that followed the signing\nof the armistice. In the history of\nfashions this will go down us a time\nwhen clothes were elaborate, with lit\ntle of beauty or good taste to recom\nmend them. It seemed that everything\npossible In the way of decoration or\nelaboration was combined In u single\nmodel.\nNow, asserts a lending fashion cor\nrespondent, we see th" reaction. The\nlines of the best clothes made today\nare very simple. There is elabora\ntion, It Is true, but it I\nllguifled\ne really\ndrapery\neir very\ntear as\nmade\nelaboration. S\'\nworks of art In\nand cleverness\nsimplicity tnali\nidels\nwty\nthem\nthough any one might I\nthem, whereas they could have been\nonly created by the brain and band of\nan artist.\nBride\'s Dream of White Satin.\nLanvin features the long court\ntrain heavily embroidered. One of\nher most interesting models is a\nbride\'s dress of white satin having a\ncourt train richly embroidered In\nwhite. This falls from the shoulders\nin one continuous piece, being at\ntached to the bodice by means f an\nembroidered band which crosses he\niront just above the decolletuge. Ixmg\nbishop sleeves of tulle, the lower half\nembroidered In while, are u feature\nof this dress. Embroidery also ap\npears across the front of the bodice\nand on the full, supple straight skirt.\nA Lanvin model of black satin with\nthe embroidered court train falling\nfrom the shoulders Is held in place by\nan embroidered band about four\ninches wide which passes over the\nshoulders and crosses the front.\nPanels hanging at each side of the\ndress are of satin shirred In at the\nbottom to embroidered tassels the ends\nof which are of black satin ribbon.\nThe skirts of even the most dignified\nfrocks still are short, although sev\neral of the best designers are showing\nskirts a trifle longer than those now\nactually being worn.\nSash Train Lends Smartness.\nA surprising number of the more In\nformal evening frocks have trains.\nThey may be only sash ends, and this,\nby the way, Is a favorite method of\nFrock of Gray Mousseline Embroider\ned In White and Gold Threads.\nevolving a train for a simple evening\ndress. Very effective are the results\nachieved through these sash trains.\nA plain little frock of orchid pink\nchiffon may be made with the neck\nline as high as those worn on street\nfrocks and cut In the stralght-across\nshallow line. The waist may be low\nand Mousing, with the skirt short and\nstraight Then, to make It the last\nword in smartness, a sash of two\ntones of pink, one a very bright\nhade. Is tied about the low waistline\nand severe\' Inches of one of the gayly\ncolored ends trail on the ground.\nA model of this kind Is as adapt-\nable as It can he. because the sash I Brocndes of great brilliancy are wot\nends may be shortened, or the sash en by the great fabric houses, espe\nmnoved altogether and any sort of , daily for hags.\na girdle used, so that one has a sim\nple afternoon dress which may be\nworn anywdiere.\nTrain dresses of this sort are, of\ncourse, In direc t opposition to the one\nWhich Is decidedly formal, but It, too,\nhas its- practical Ride, for the band\nsupporting the train Is mude separate\nfrom the dress and Just slips over the\n(boulders.\nTrain Makes Its Own Laws.\nThe train, having once got hack Into\nthe limelight, takes to Itself many lib\nerties, It absolutely refuses to abide\nby uny set rules. It may even fall\nfrom the front of a dress. A frock\ncreated by one of our own American\nAn Interesting Frock of Black Velvet\nand Black Lace.\ndesigners has a very uneven hem, the\nfrcant being extremely short and the\nskirt falling much longer at the sides\nand back. There Is a sash which ties\nIn a bow directly in the front and the\nlong ends hang to the ankles several\nInches below the bottom of the skirt.\nTo accentuate the appearance of the\nunevenness of the hem there are side\npanels also longer than the skirt.\nPerhaps the most popular place for\na train is at one side. The wrapped\naround effect with the drapery drawn\nacross the stomach, as In this model,\nis very prominent in fashions. These\nmodels, slightly draped at the waist\nline In a free and easy manner, are\nquite a contrast to the tightly draped\nprincess dress sponsored by Made\nleine et Madeleine. Dresses of this\nsort usually fasten at the left side\nThis one Illustrates, too, the liking\nfor black and white In evening\nfrocks. It Is of white velvet, show\ning a long side panel of black velvet\nand black tulle. The large Hat flow\ners are cif velvet and tulle. The back\nof the dress is draped In the same\nmanner ns the front.\nBlack Broadcloth for Evening Wear.\nEver BO many of the skirts which\nj wrap tightly around the figure have\nfullness let In by means of narrow\n\' godets on one side only toward the\ni front. They may be laid In where the\nskirt laps over and forms the closing.\nt\'herult has resorted to black broad\ncloth feir evening dress. She embroid\ners It In white. (Hie such model has a\nnovel skirt, with one side wrapping\nover the long train, while the other\nconies from underneath the train, fit\nting the figure quite snugly. On the\nskirt are two bands of embroidery In\nleaf design. Long, full sleeves are of\nwhite lace. So, also are the sides and\nbnck of the bodice, the lutter having\nan appliqued square of the brond\ncloth. Another model which is very lovely\nIs of white brocade und black lace. It\nshows the corsage swathed about the\nhost and cut fairly low In the back.\nA length of the black lace outlines tl.e\nsquare decolletage at the back. This\nband, about six inches at the small of\nthe hack, widens until It is at least\ntwelve Inches over the shoulders, and\nthen It falls nt the front In pointed\nends. The skirl is short and of the\nwrapped type, and there Is a black\nlace train attached to the waistline at\nthe side.\nScarf Adds Distinctive Touch.\nA most Important movement In eve\nning dresses might be termed the\nscarflike movement. It appears on\nmany models and may be described In\nthis way : The silhouette of a straight\nchemise dress is changed by attaching\na scarf to the hem of the skirt or to\nthe belt of the dress. Scarfs starting\nat the belt line always loop at the bot\ntom of the dress and then up. forming\nthe bodice, swathing the shoulders\nand falling down one side. These\nscarfs are of the same material as\nthe drees.\nThis season\'s evening dresses are\nmuch less decollete than they have\nbeen for some time past. All of the\nmodels today show a rather high neck\nline for evening gowns\nBrocades for Bags.\nlll!lilllJIJIIIIIIIIIIIIIIUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMIIU!\nThe Kitchen\nI Cabinet\nniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimiiimiimiiiiuiir;\n((e). 1120.

Guy de Maupassant.\nWHAT SHALL WE HAVE TO EAT?\nTho rtsllv problem of something\ngood and liked by all the family may\nie helped by the follow\ning suggestions:\nLamb Broth with Rice.\nCut three pounds of\nIamb from the neck Into\nsmall pieces; add three\nquarts of cold wnter and\nRet over the fire to cook ;\ncontinue the cooking un\ntil the lamb Is, tender,\nthen remove the meat for hash or cro\nquettes.
