The last two to three years\nhave been noted for the worst global economic downturn since the\nGreat Depression in the 1930s. Since most modern marketing\nknowledge and theory has been developed in the generally prosperous\neconomic conditions that have existed since World War\nII, this recent experience can be seen to give marketing academics\ntheir first real opportunity to re-examine the dominant principles\nunder different conditions that bring new challenges for businesses,\nconsumers and governments.\nThe five short papers presented in this special section of this issue\nare all taken from presentations made at BIGMAC5. This was\nthe fifth joint colloquium organised by ANZMAC and EMAC and it\ntook place as part of the 12th annual ANZMAC conference hosted\nby Monash University in Melbourne in December 2009. The official\noverall theme that dominated the three days of the conference was\nthat of sustainability. Interest in sustainability has become prevalent\nin recent years because of the challenges that have arisen pri-\nmarily from ‘western’ consumption and business practices. The\nconsequences of these are seen to manifest themselves in debates\nabout climate change and resource utilisation. In the latter area, we\nhave increasing concern about resource depletion such as oil and\nwater, and also waste disposal. We can see that the issues that\nhave prompted the debate on sustainability are essentially environmental\nso it is timely to remind ourselves that although pre-\nsented in different ways (e.g. Neumayer, 2003), models of\nsustainability have reflected the three interlocking systems of the\nenvironment, society and the economy since at least the seminal\nbook Man, Mind and Land by Walter Firey first published in 1960\n(Firey, 1960). The so-called ‘weak’ approaches to sustainability\ntend to view the three systems in an interlocking way as shown\nin Fig. 1, whilst the strong views portray both the economy and\nsociety as subsystems of the wider environmental system in order\nto show levels of dependence. The strong model, portrayed in\nFig. 2, makes it clear that there are limits to levels of substitution\nbetween natural and man-made capital (e.g. Getzner, 1999) and\nso whatever is conducted in a business system has to be compatible\nwith the wider social and environmental systems. Whichever\nview one wishes to adopt, it is clear that discussion on the latest\nrecession falls very much within the context of a wider sustainability\nremit. This allowed for a wide range of perspectives to be cov-\nered in the BIGMAC session.\nThe papers are deliberately selected to reflect different approaches\nto the recession and sustainability – particularly from\nthe managerial, macro and consumer perspectives of marketing.1441-3582/$ - see front matter \x02 2010 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academ\ndoi:10.1016/j.ausmj.2010.06.001In the first paper, Gary Lilien and Raji Srinivasan provide a summary\nof results from empirical research of firms in the recession.\nTheir results show some important implications. They make it\nclear that there is no one single response in terms of marketing\nvariables that can be applied universally and will help company\nperformance in a recession. However, their analysis also makes it\nclear that it is appropriate to consider the kind of markets in which\ncompanies compete when seeking to find appropriate strategies.\nPopular discourse on recessions and their effects tend to focus on\nindustry sectors and government actions and interventions are often\ntargeted at that level. Lilien and Srinivasan demonstrate that\nother views of the economy (e.g. B2B and B2C) may be highly relevant\nfor understanding how to respond to recessions and they\nalso demonstrate the potential effectiveness of choosing the right\nmarketing tools.\nDaniel Tixier offers an extremely absorbing ‘opinion’ article that\nbridges the managerial and macro perspectives. He demonstrates\nhow structures have changed in markets and marketing over the\nrecent decades and considers the nature of the recession in this\ncontext. Following his thoughtful piece it becomes clear that nothing\nwill be the same again after this recession. Business has chan-\nged. Markets have changed and his chosen term, mutation,\nreminds us how we can potentially learn from other systems such\nas biology and physics when we think about changes in marketing.\nReaders familiar with ideas from complexity science will grasp this\nat once (see for example The Web of Life by Fritjof Capra (1996) and\nin a more explicit way Conroy and Allen take us back to some of\nthese principles in the final paper of this section.\nIn the next paper, we are offered a different perspective that\noriginates completely from a macromarketing standpoint. Andreas\nFalkenberg examines the ethical principles of exchange and questions\nthe adequacy of some marketing institutions. His examples\nare set in the context of international marketing, and particularly\ntrade which deals with poorer nations. However, two other\nreminders spring forth when considering Falkenberg’s treatise.\nFirstly, a considerable part of the responsibility for the recession\nhas been directly attributed to the greed of financial institutions\nthat arguably transgressed the same moral principles that Falkenberg\ndebates in his paper. Secondly, the imbalance of power and\nreturns from exchanges that he questions also has a direct impact\non sustainability because they put pressure on the societal subsystem.\nIndeed, under a strong model of sustainability, which sees the\neconomic system as a component of the larger environmental and\nsocial systems, it may be possible to argue that higher levels of\nmoral maturity are a fundamental requirement of business\npractice.y.

A strong approach to sustainability.\n180 Editorial / Australasian Marketing Journal 18 (2010) 179–180While Falkenberg examines the moral dimensions of exchange\nand focuses on marketing institutions, the fourth paper in this section\nby Timothy Devinney examines moral aspects of consump-\ntion. This has been a key element of the sustainability debate in\nmarketing in the last decade. For example, topics such as ethical\nconsumption and voluntary simplification have both attracted special\nissues in journals (Newman and Shaw, 2007; Zavetoski, 2002)\nand at Auckland University, an anti-consumption research network,\nICAR, has been established. Amongst this work, the hopeand/or belief has been expressed that sustainability can be con-\nsumer led, that the marketplace itself will lead business in different\ndirections. The paper by Devinney examines research that he\nand others have conducted on this topic and concludes that there\nis little empirical evidence to support the general notion of ethical\nconsumption as a widespread phenomenon. One might expect that\na period of recession would offer special challenges for consumers\ntrying to follow ethical premises as economic constraints make\nself-interest an even greater imperative, but Devinney’s conclusions\nlead us to challenge the idea of ethical consumption as a sig-\nnificant phenomenon in any context.\nThe final BIGMAC paper by Conroy and Allen is a forward looking\npaper that seeks to address how behaviour change might be at-\ntained and hence potentially move us away from the position\ndescribed by Devinney. Conroy and Allen base their discussion in\nthe context of social marketing which has grown up over the last\nthree decades trying to grapple with many contexts where selfinterest\nand public good come into direct conflict. Conroy and Allen\nreflect on the role of systems as a framework, not just for studying\nissues relating to sustainable consumption, but also as a means for\npotentially intervening and changing behaviour. They also emphasise\nthe nature of systems as complex adaptive processes that self-\norganise and in this context Tixier’s idea of mutation becomes very\npowerful. In stressing systems as an approach, the paper by Conroy\nand Allen completes our circle. While there are many other critical\ndebates for marketers around this topic, we started this editorial\nby portraying sustainability, and the recession as part of that problem,\nin a systems framework. Conroy and Allen want us to explic-\nitly use this approach in order face future marketplace challenges.\nReferences\nCapra, F., 1996. The Web of Life. Anchor Books, New York, NY.\nFirey, W., 1960.
