        <pre>['"t\nTWENTY-FIRST YEAR.\nPLENTY OF WARMTH\nHouse and Senate Sessions Yesterday\nAmong the Most Interesting of\nthe Session.\nHot Debates Are the Order and the\nAtmosphere Charged With Ora\xad\ntorical Electricity.\nSimpson, LaMoure and \\A$plbert Come\nTogether Over Amendment of\nGame Law.\nOil Inspection Bill Passed, the Senate\nConcurring in the House\nAmendments.\nThe Maximum Coal Rate Bill Fur\xad\nnishes Its Share of Fun for\nthe Cay.\nTHE SENATE.\nThere was no dearth of interest in the\nsession of the senate yesterday. Inter\xad\nspersed with the routine passage of house\nthere were interesting debates,\nbills\npassages at arms between senators,\nmotions to recess, calls for the consider\xad\nation of bills that got temporarily side\xad\ntracked, bursts of applause when some\nparticularly bright peroration was ren\xad\ndered and finally the senate recessed\nuntil this morning just at the close of\nthe hottest debate of the day, when Sen\xad\nators Simpson, LaMoure and Wolbert\nhad it hammer and tongs over the pro\xad\nposed amendment prohibiting the killing\nof deer for four years. Senator Simpson\nwas called to order a couple of times as\nhe responded hotly to the intimation of\nSenator Wolbert that the hunters in the\nwestern part of the state were scheming\nto shut out the hunters from the eastern\npart of the state and do all the killing\nof deer themselves in defiance of law.\nSenator LaMoure made the points of\norder and looked to it that the decorum\nof the senate remained as nearly invio\xad\nlate as possible considering the heat,\nand finally after the amendment to the\nbill had been adopted, a recess was taken\nbefore a roll call was hid on the amend\xad\ned bill,.\nMr. Simpson set the ball rolling when\nhe proposed an amendment to house\nbill 18, the game law amendment, pro\xad\nhibiting the killing of deer until January\n1,1905. He supported, the amendment\nwith the statement that the deer were\nfast disappearing and some legislation of\nthis kind-was necessary to prevent their\nextermination.\nSenator LaMoure opposed the amend\xad\nment. Its purpose was to deprive the\npeople in the Red river valley, th^ real\ntax payers, from having their enjoyment\nfor a few days every year at hunting.\nThe law as it already existed limited the\nnumber of deer to be killed and afforded\nprotection.\nMr. Simpson said he was sorry to pro\xad\npose an amendment that would deprive\nthe Pembina man of his annual ideer\nhunt, but it judwould dome west they\nwould try to provide some other amuse\xad\nment for him, possibly in the way of\nhunting wolves, thtit Would thrive and\nincrease now that the legislature had\ntaken the bounty off.\nMr. LaMoure said there wasn\'t any\nother game in the western part of the\nstate that might be substituted except\nthe wheel and that didn\'t suit him.\nMr. Cooper wanted to amend by mak\xad\ning the time of prohibition of killing of\ndeer three years. Mr. Simpson 7a? will\xad\ning to consent, but Mr. LaMoure raised\nthe point of order that having already\nvoted five yeafp the senate couldn\'t\namend in the next breath and make it\nthree»\nHere Mr. Wolbert broke into the game.\nHe said the [amendment was a scheme\nby which the members in the western\npart of the state would shut out those in\nthe eastern part of the state from hunt\xad\ning, atid would themselves continue\nhunting deer twelve months in the year\nin defiance of the law.\nMr.\nSimpson\nI\nresented this statement\nhotly, and characterised it as unfair and\nimtnanly if it was meant.\naere 2&. LaMoure jabbed his forefin\xad\nger in the diredtioh of the senate stenog\xad\nrapher withthe request that the lan\xad\nguage of the gentleman from Starkbe\ntaken down. He said possibly he Was\nmistaken in saying gentleman, getting\nin a side swipe at Simpson, He.also\nasked that the Stark county sefcataj: bo\ncalled to ordei.\nThe chair ordered the gentleman from\nStark to desist from personalities. Mr.\nSimpson, net at all daunted by the ob\nsefvations ot\'the Pembina {Statesman,\ngaid he was entirely willing to have bis\nstatement taken down. He didn\'t sup\npa& th* mm*mm\no09|d ftwe wwwrt\ntie \'people the western |wwio4 the\nstate would deliberately violate the law.\nHe resented such statements. The peo\xad\nple in the western part of the state would\ncompare favorably in morals with those\nin the eastern part, and as amoral peo\xad\nple nobody could get away from the peo\xad\nple of all parts of North Dakota.\nHere some excitable spectator broke\nintti applause and President Bartlett\ncalled a halt on demonstrations.\nMr. Jacobson said the amendment was\nall right and was desired by the people\nin the western part of the state. The\npeople in the eastern part of the state\nwould be benefitted by it, for if some\nsuch legislation were not enacted there\nwouldn\'t be any deer left, for them to\nhunt.\nHere Mr. LaMoure moved a recess un\xad\ntil this morning.\nMr. Simpson started to oppose, and\nwas again called to order.\nThen the Stark county statesman re\xad\nmarked that if he was not out of order,\nhe wanted to call to the attention of the\nsenate the unfairness of taking a recess\nbefore a roll call was had on the amended\nbill, but if he was out of order he would\nnot say it.\nThe brought down the house again,\nbut the motion to recess prevailed with\nthe amendment adopted but the bill not\nacted upon.\nTHE COAL BATE BILL.\nMr. Cox also kept the atmosphere\ntorrid with demands during the after\xad\nnoon for the sending of the coal rate bill\nto the house.\nThis bill was passed the day before in\nthe senate, was not messaged down until\nyesterday, when it required a suspension\nof the rules to receive it.\nThe house refused to suspend the rules\nbut afterward relented and voted to re\xad\nceive it.\nA clerk had gotten down with the bill\nafter it had been refused and brought it\nback again.\nThen the senatorial dignity was of\xad\nfended and the senate refused to send\nthe bill back again.\nMr. Cox made several attempts to call\nthe bill up, while the house was pro\xad\nceeding with the third reading of house\nbills. Another senate bill was refused\nby the house which afterward voted to\nreceive it. When Senator Hale moved\nto send this bill back, Mr. Cox moved to\nattach 156.\nThen Mr. Little objected. He was not\nwilling that any other bill should be\nsent down on that motion.\nMr. Cox wanted to know where the\nsenaljp was at on the question of proced\xad\nure. He couldn\'t see why the bill\ndidn\'t go down. Mr. Murphy wanted to\nknow if the steering committee was reg\xad\nulating the order of procedure for the\nhouse.\nWhen the reading and passage of\nhouse bills stopped, Mr. Cox was up\nagain with his meat axe. Mr. Little\nmoved a recess until 10 o\'clock this\nmorning. Mr. Cox said a motion to ad\xad\njourn to a set time was debatable. He\nwanted to make a statement to the\nhouse about senate bill 156. Points of\norder were raised. Mr. Cox said: "I\npass" and quit for a time. They were\ncoming too thick for him. The motion\nto recess was lost. Then the senate\nwent back to the regular order again.\nBREATHING FAINTLY.\nMr. Noble took advantage of the gen\neneral torridity to add his mite. He\ngot a skewer into the exemption bill and\ngot it laid-on the table. When the bill\ncame up, Mr. Baker moved an amend\xad\nment to make the exemption $1,000 in\xad\nstead of $750, as the bill passed the\nhouse. Mr. Baker\'s amendment carried.\nThen Mr. Hale moved to amend by\n^riking out $1,000 wherever it appeared\nin the bill and inserting $2,000. Mr.\nNoble moved to lay the amendment on\nthe table. This Was carried so quick\nthat Senator LaMoure couldn\'t get in\nthe request lor a division. When he "did\nget up Mr. Noble raised a\' point of order\nthat his motion wasn\'t debatable. Jud\nsaid he toerely wanted to explain and\naddressed himself BO directly to the\ngentleman from Bottitaeten, that he was\ncalled to order for not addressing the\nchair. On\' th§ division the motion to\ntable cartifed. When the vote on the\nbill*$ fc&epdfed came up, Senator Noble\nmade ir point ot! order that the amend\xad\nment hating been tabled, carried the bill\nWith it. The point was "Well taken, and\nthe bill went to the fable. Mr. Jj&Moure\nappealed to the senate. Sow would\nthat body explain to the house What had\nbecome of its bill? Mr. Noble said there\nwasn\'t any nqed to worry about inform\xad\ning the hbuse. The bill was still on the\ntable. It was alive yet. It still breathed,\nalthough very faintly, he admitted. The\nsenate could take up the bill any time it\nwanted to do so from the table. At re\xad\ncess the bill was still op the table.\nmapacmcm,\nt)imi^5T&e afternoon a few Boinan\ncandles went up on the oil inspection\nmatter. The conference committee ap\xad\npointed on the bill had not reported.!\nMr. Little wanted to bring the bill back,\ndischarge the conference committee and\nact on the bill in the senate.\nMr. Hale didn\'t see the need of any\nhurry. The house committee ought to\nreport first on the conference.\nMr. Little said it was possible they\nmight not report. It was getting near\nthe end of the session and the time was\nshort.\nFinally the committee reported that\nthei conference couldn\'t agree.\nMr. Little moved that the senate re\xad\ncede from its position and concur in the\nhouse amendments. Mr. Hale opposed\nthe amended bill. He said the bill as it\nstood now wouldn\'t permit the sale of\nsoline as an illuminating oil. There\nwas a number of objections to the bill!\nSenators Lewis and Wolbert took a\nwhack at the matter on the other side.\nThere seemed to be a g?od deal of mis\xad\ninformation scattered around as to the\nprovisions of the bill, they thought. It\nwas all right. The senate receded and\nconcurred in the house amendments and\nso the matter was settled.\nANOTHER APPOINTMENT.\nGovernor White messaged the appoint\xad\nment of W. H. Webb, Jr., as member of\nthe state reform school board at Man\ndan, an appointment that had been\nomitted when the other members of this\nboard were named. The senate con\nfirmed the appointment.\nPASSED.\nThe following house bills were passed:\n182, licensing of storage warehouses.\n214, management of state normal school\nboard.\n32, "barber bill.\n73, manner of drawing jurors.\n103, to prevent adulteration of food.\n124. levy of township road taxes.\n139, unlawful obligations.\n86, surety bond for school treasurers.\n173, determination of nominee edtitled\nto party place on official ballot.\n203, bonds for drains.\n153, system of weights and measures.\n144, redistricting commissioner dis\xad\ntricts.\n318, optional purchase of road machin\xad\nery.\n36, wolf bounty by counties $2.\n181, penalty for infringement of pop\nlabels.\n16, amendment for change of name of\ndeaf asylum.\n167, prohibiting sale of game.\n213, fixing taxes as prior liens.\n1(6, farm laborers\' liens.\nTHE HOUSE.\nThe house had an eventful time of it\nyesterday, and many of the members\nwill go home with enlarged ideas as to\nthe versatility of legislators when it\ncomes to manipulation of pending legis\xad\nlation, and a conviction that all tricks\nare not in vain—sometimes—perhaps.\nFor some reason the house could not\nsettle down to hard work as in the pre\xad\nvious two days, and everywhere there\nwas an air of uneasiness apparent. The\nsenate, many members felt, was not pass\xad\ning house bills with such alacrity as was\ndesired by the anxious ones in the west\nend of the building, and there was a dis\xad\nposition in some quarters to take things\neasy with senate measures on that ac\xad\ncount but, notwithstanding, the house\nturned out a lot of work.\nDuring the last part of the session Mr.\nBacon was in the chair.

C., March 7.—The\ndivision of forestry of the U. S. depart\xad\nment of agriculture has selected from its\nworking force two trained lumbermen\nwith some knowledge of forestry, to be\nsent to the Philippine islands in compli\xad\nance with a cable request of the Taft\nPhilippine commission. The persons se\xad\nlected for this work are Mr. Grant Bruce,\nformerly a state forester in New York,\nand Mr. Edward Hamilton. Both of\nthese men are expert lumbermen with\nsome training in forestry, and have been\nselected in view of their special fitness\nfor the Philippine work.\nA bureau of forestry was established\nin the Philippines in April, 1900, with\nCapt. George P. Ahern, Ninth United\nStates Infantry, in charge. The work\nof this bureau has convinced the Taft\ncommission of the great importance of\nthe timber lands asia natural source of\nwealth and of the necessity of putting\nthe bureau on a substantial footing and\nhandling these woodlands under scien\xad\ntific forest methods. Furthermore, it is\nevident that the cutting of timber under\nproper regulations will provide a large\nand increasing annual revenue to the\ngovernment. It has been found neces\xad\nsary to permit the cutting of timber to\nsupply the pressing needs, but care has\nbeen taken at the same time that the\ncutting should be done in a manner\nthat would work no injury to the future\ngrowth of the forests. These consider\xad\nations led the commission to cable to\nWashington for trained foresters to\nassist in putting the service on a more\nsatisfactory footing.\nUnder the Spanish administration the\ntimber lands of the Philippine Islands\nwere in charge of a department of fores\xad\ntry, which was organized in 1863. The\npersonnel of the department was made\nup of expert foresters, rangers, clerks,\ndraughtsmen, etc., the higher officials\nbeing selected from the Spanish corps of\nengineers.\nAfter Captain Ahern was appointed\nhe received authority to appoint a small\nnumber of foresters, rangers and clerks.\nBy September his office force had been\ndoubled in order to handle the work of\nthe bureau properly. The call for ac\xad\ntivity on the part of those in charge of\nthe bureau of forestry was emphasized\nat once by the lumber famine in Manila\nand other important towns, owing to the\ndestruction of buildings during the war\nand the increased demand for good\ndwelling houses resulting from the large\ninflux of Americans. For these reasons\nthe felling of trees and the marketing of\nlumber had to begin soon after the es\xad\ntablishment of the bureau. Captain\nAhern is in constant communication\nwith the division of forestry for assis\xad\ntance and cooperation with the Philip\xad\npine bureau of forestry.\nThe work of that bureau was confined\nfor some months to the Island of Luzon,\nbut recently has been carried to other\npoints in the archipelago. The present\nplan of the bureau is to cover all the im\xad\nportant forests as the development of the\nworking force will permit. One great\ndrawback which is retarding the work\nof the bureau, is the lack of capable and\nactive subordinate officials. It is diffi\xad\ncult to find men familiar with the forest\nconditions and the uses of the woods of\nthe Philippines, who are entirely satis\xad\nfactory in other respects. It is believed\nthat the best means of securing a com\xad\npetent and efficient force is to employ\nnew men and train them on the ground\nas speedily as possible. In this work\nMessrs. Bruce and Hamilton will be able\nto render valuable assistance.\nThe bureau was recently reorganized\nso as to consist of an officer in charge,\nan inspector, a botanist, a chief clerk\nand stenographer, a translator, a law\nclerk, a record clerk, 1Q assistant fores\xad\nters and 20 rangers. It is the intention\nof the. officer in charge to work up a for\xad\nest service on the linos of the work car\xad\nried on in thei U. S. department of agri\xad\nculture through itsdi vision of forestry.\ntThe wholesale degtruction of timber will\nbe stopped, an4 the cutting will proceed\nunder regulations looking to the future\nieldB ot the forests, fye fire question\nwill flap receivoiJloee attention. J.\'r\\\nCaptain Ahern, ina recent report,\ncalls attention to several obstacles in the\nway of immediate success in lumbering\nIn the Philippine islands, the\nserf-\njt»\nVt\nous drawbacks being lack of good roads\nand skilled labor. Forest roads and\nriver driveways are almost unknown,\nand present methods of lumbering are\nslow and expensive. The natives, he\nfinds, are not skilled workmen, and\nthough receiving very low wages, their\nwork is found by no means cheap when\none considers the cost of felling and\nhauling a cubic foot of timber to the\nshipping point.\nThe forest lands of the Philippine\nislands, it is estimated by Captain Ahern,\ncover 40,000,000 acres larger in extent\nand greater in value than the forests of\nIndia. There are 385 species of timber\nproducing trees and about 50 more\nspecies as yet unclassified. Included in\nthe above lists are very hard woods,\ncapable of taking a beautiful polish\nwoods that resist climatic influences and\nthe attack of white ants still others that\nare especially suited for sea-piling or for\nuse as railroad ties. There are many\nvarieties of trees producing valuable\ngums, oils and drugs rubber and gutta\npercha are abundant in Mindanao and\nTawi-Tawi while at least 17 dye-woods\nare found within the limits of the\narchipelago. Cocoanut palms grow\nwithout care or cultivation throughout\nthe islands. There are also many varie\xad\nties of palms, bamboo, canes, and rattan\nwhich are of commercial value and will\nafford profitable employment to native\nlabor.\nMr. Bruce and Mr. Hamilton have\nsailed from San Francisco for Manila on\nthe transport Indiana.\nFLAVIN FIRED.\nScrap in Parliament and Mike Flavin\nFired with Other Irish Members.\nLondon, March 7.—The house of com\xad\nmons early this mornihg resembled the\nAustrian richsrath. There were free\nfights and the police carried out of the\nchamber sixteen struggling, fighting\nIrish members. It was the first time in\nhistory that a policeman has been seen\non the floor of the house of commons.\nAfter midnight Mr. Balfour applied\nthe closure in the educational estimates\nin the house of commons. The nation\xad\nalists shouted "Gag! gag!" and refused\nto leave the house when the division was\ntaken.\nThe speaker ordered them to with\xad\ndraw, but they refused, amid great up\xad\nroar. The speaker called upon the ser\ngeant-at-arms to remove them. They\nshouted defiance and a number of offi\xad\ncers and policemen entered to enforce\nremoval.\nEugene Crean, member for southeast\nCork, struggled desperately against re\xad\nmoval and there was quite a free fight\non the floor lasting five minutes, other\nIrishmen assisting him. Mr. Crean\nstuci his legs under the seat and could\nnot be moved for some minutes.\nMeanwhile after policemen were strug\xad\ngling and fighting with other Irishmen,\nwho stood up and obstructed the passage\nof the police to Mr. Crean\'s seat. The\nIrish shouted "Don\'t kill him" and\n"Don\'t kill the man."\nThe nationalists fought and struggled\nfrantically but at length a superior force\nof police succeeded in dragging Mr.\nCrean out by the legs and arms and car\xad\nrying him down the floor of the house,\nthe Irishmen standing and wildly shout\xad\ning "shame," "murderers" and "South\nAfrican brutality."\nThe benches below the gangway on the\nopposition side was amass of struggling\nhumanity. Several policemen were\nstruck with fists. Free fights between\nthe police and the members were fairly\ngeneral.\nAs Mr. McHugh was being carried out\n—his underclothes showing where the\nouter garments had been torn away in\nthe struggle—Mr. Flavin shouted from\nthe back benches: "Nineteen policemen\nto remove one Irishman!" and cries of\n"shame" was heard from the opposition\nbenches.\nThe speaker then ordered the removal\nof the others. Amid renewed howls of\nexecration the policemen grappled with\nthem and carried them by arms and legs\nover the benches and out of the house.\nWhile Mr. Donelan was being removed\nthe nationalists rose and sang "God\nSave Ireland." Six policemen sufficed\nfor each member, with the exception of\nMr. Flavin, who is a big man and re\xad\nquired eight. Many, as they were being\ncarried out, waved their hands and\nshouted, "God save Ireland."\nSUICIDE.\nMan Who Died at Edgeley AfUr Being\nArrested Said to Have Committed\nSuicide.\nHuron, March 7.—J. J. Bennash who\nfell dead soon after being arrested ns»jr\nEdgeley, D., proves to have\nwanted here for running away with\nmortgaged property. Sheriff Kerr has\nreturned from Edgeley and says fiennash\nevidently committed suicide.\n&\n*4\',-\nFIVE CENTS\nSlOtll FILLS OFFICE\nScrap Over the Appointment of Post\xad\nmaster at Sioux Falls Growing\nWarmer.\nSenator Kyle Presents Day\'s Papers\nand is Fghting the Nomination\nof Phillips.\nMontana Legislature Adjourns Sine\nDie Without Electing a\nSenator.\nWashington, March 7.—The contest\nfor the postmastership at Sioux Falls\nappears to be becoming more compli\xad\ncated. Senator Kyle has forwarded the\npapers of C. M. Day to the postoffice\ndepartment and it is the senator\'s inten\xad\ntion to recommend Day\'s appointment.\nJ. E. Phillips, who has the endorsement\nof Senator Gamble and Representative\nBurke, is expected here next week and\nJ. Tojplinson Jr., business partner of Mr.\nDay, is already here in behalf of the\nlatter.\nEven if Phillips is nominated before\nthe adjournment, the senate confirmation\nwill probably not be made. A move will\nsoon be made to give Phillips a recess\nappointment and it is understood that\nagain Phillips will be opposed by Kyle\nunless it is held in abeyance till the re\xad\nturn of Representative Burke.\nACCEPT LIBRARIES.\nMinnesota Legislature Passes a Bill\nPermitting Cities to Accept Public\nLibraries—Additional Appropriation\nfor Capitol.\nSt. Paul, March \'7.—Senator Brown\nsecured a suspension of rules and the\npassage of the bill allowing cities and\nvillages to accept donations for public li-.\nbrary buildings, such as those made by\nAndrew Carnegie to Duluth, St. Cloud\nand Mankato, and to comply with the\nconditions of the donation.\nThe senate passed .the new capitol bill\nappropriating an additional $1,000,000 for\nfinishing the building.\nThe Buffalo exposition appropriation\npassed the house under suspension of\nthe rules.\nWomen of the civic league have ar\xad\nranged to have an arts and crafts exhibit\nthe week of April 22.\nNO NEW TRIAL.\nHamilton\'s Attorneys Will Not Ask\nfor New Trial and He will Go to\nStillwater.\nMinneapolis, March 7.—The ten-day\nstay in the Hamilton case will be up at\n5 p. m. tomorrow. It is settled that the\nattorneys will not ask for anew trial.\nHamilton will, accordingly, be taken to\nStillwater early next week to enter upon\nhis seven-year term.\nHamilton this afternoon was in very\ngood spirits and in better health than he\nhas enjoyed for a week. He regards his\ncase as settled, and is too philosophical\nto waste time in vain regrett. He says\nhe is persuaded that justice will prevail\neventually, and that he will be buoyed\nup during his confinement by the con\xad\nsciousness of innocence.\nPRIEST KILLS HIMSELF.\nDespondent Because Discharged From:\nHis Charge at Duluth.\nMinneapolis, March 7.—Despondent\nover his recent discharge from the Du\xad\nluth diocese of the Catholic church as\nindicated by letters found on his person.\nRev. Francis J. Runseyonski shot him\xad\nself twice through the heart at th&\nGolden West hotel.

The schools were closed a few\nweeks ago because of scarlet fever and\nhad been opened only a week.\nHotel Quarantined.\nAberdeen, March 7.—The board of\nhealth has quarantined the Ward hotel.\nNo person is allowed to enter or leave.\nHelena, March 7.—James McArthur, mi:\nan ex-convict, wanted for k£Ulpg Capt.\nDotsop Feb. 15,\n•41\n1\n1\n1\nIf\n#1-\nIS\nft\ni\'7^1\nit\ns#\nfcvtt\nIS\nIB\nl&l', 'Mi$lf\nInL*\nW\ni\'viv\nf"\nN\n3\n3\nI\nKill\n$\niflSS\nm^\ni®\nfsl\n:i\n-m\nsfe\nSyibun*.\nBy M. H. JEWELL.\nAll the appointments of Governor\nWhite have been confirmed—which isn\'t\nalways the case with executive plums.\nThe senate has killed the bill to reduce\nthe exemptions from 81,500 to $750 and\nnow every member will dare to go home.\nNo citizen of Burleigh county has\ntaken advantage of the Nelson bankrupt\xad\ncy law—no matter how guilty we may bo\nin other wavs.\nThe Fargo Call has it on th\n3\nauthority\nof a Free Methodist minister that blind\npigs are thriving at Jamestown but" the\nCall doubts the authority.\nA member of the Jamestown school\nboard thinks the board should buy wood\nbv the car load instead of by the cord\nfor the public schools. The board should\ndo neither—they should buy lignite coal\nbv the car.\nSenator Pettigrew declares that he will\nalways be a member of that party that is\nopposed to the plutocrats, and admits\nthat it may be necessary—if the demo\xad\ncrats make peace with Cleveland—he\nwill flock all by himself.\nThe resources of North Dakota ought\nto be advertised at the Buffalo exposi\xad\ntion. The absence of North Dakota at\nwhat promises to be an industrial exhibit\nexcelled only by the world\'s fair at Chi\xad\ncago, would be an oversight—a mistake\n—that would cost the state many times\nits cost.\nWhat about senate bill 156 anyhow?\nla it a bill calculated to benefit the users\nof fuel throughout the state without do\xad\ning an injustice to the railroad company\n—or is it a measure to force the railroad\nto stand for the long haul fellow and de\xad\nprive the near-by mine of its natural ad\xad\nvantages? What is the sense of all this\nsquabble? Why are not these measures\nbrought up and decided on their merits?\nIf senate bill 156 is special legislation\nin effect let us know it—if for the bene\xad\nfit of consumers of coal and at the same\ntime not unjust to common carriers, let\nus know it.\nThis is the last day of the seventh leg\xad\nislative assembly. The closing days dif\xad\nfer but little from the closing days of\npast sessions. Harmony has perhaps\ncharacterized the proceedings of the\npresent day to a greater and more notice\xad\nable degree than any session since state\xad\nhood. There have been but few really\nimportant measures before the legisla\xad\nture, and the relations of the people with\nthe corporations have been so amicable\nthe friction usually caused by what is\nknown as anti-railway legislation has\nbeen reduced to the minimum. A few\npet measures have been jeopardized by\ndelayed committee reports, inflexible\nrules, parliamentary tactics, dilatory mo\xad\ntions, adjournments and other mysteri\xad\nous procedure, and the proceedings of\nyesterday were characterized by consid\xad\nerable tension—terminating at the close\nwith threats of retaliation, deadlocks,\npromiscuous slaughter of bills and the\nline. Now it will be well for each mem\xad\nber to bear in mind that sharp practice\n.ma wrong doingon the part of one mem\xad\nber.\na dozen members or the whole\nhouse does not justify retaliation on\nuiiritorious pending measures. Mem\nbci.s should bear in mind that their con\xad\nstituents, while condemning discourteous\naud unjust acts on the one hand, will\nliot justify or applaud an unjust act in\nru filiation. Every measure should stand\noi fall on its own merits. For one house\nto\nor hold up a measure in retalia\xad\ntion is compounding crime, and those\nwho indulge in it are guilty of wrong do\nin:.\'.

Under\nthe rules the message could not be re\xad\nceived by the house without a suspen\xad\nsion of the rules. Among the bills .that\nwas messaged over was senate bill 156, a\nbill establishing maximum railroad rates\non coal a bill that many persons opposed\nfor the reason that they thought it would\ninjure rather than benefit the coal inter\xad\nests, as they considered the bill would\nantagozize the railroads, which had al\xad\nready shown a disposition to treat coal\ncompanies fairly, it being charged by\nsome that the bill was solely in the in\xad\nterest of a Dickinson coal company.\nThe messenger of the senate had two\nmessages, one covering the rate oill and\none relating to the other measures. He\nread both messages, and Hare at once\nmoved that the house do not receive the\nmessage as to the rate bill. Young\nmoved as a substitute that the house do\nreceive the message. The motion failed\nto receive the necessary two-thirds vote\nand the senate messenger returned the\nbill and message, to the senate. The\nvote on this matter stood 37 to\'23.\nHare move the clincher, but was de\xad\nfeated.\nBacon moved the suspension of the\nrules, and that the bunch of bills in the\nother message, senate bills 176, 217, 167\nand 227, be received. Young moved as a\nsubstitute that the vote on senate bill\n156 be reconsidered, which motion pre\xad\nvailed, and the motion was reconsidered\nby 42 to 14. Hare demanded a verifica\xad\ntion and the result was 46 to 13.\nWHO CLOMMED THE BILL?\nIt was about this time that the desk\nforce discovered that both the message\nconcerning senate bill 156 and the bill it\xad\nself were missing, and forthwith there\nwas a row. Young accused Messenger\nLindsay of purloining the bill. Leech\narose and explained the matter as stated\nabove, and then Young""strongly inti\xad\nmated that Tuttle, who had been at the\nhouse desk, had swiped the precious\ndocument. Leech said under the cir\xad\ncumstances when the house refused to\nreceive the message as to senate bill 156,\nthe messenger had nothing else to do but\nto return it.\nThe speaker called Bacon to the chair.\nYoung moved that all the bills mes\xad\nsaged over from the senate as above be\nreceived under suspension of the rules.\nRose demanded a division of the ques\xad\ntion, which being granted, the motion to\nreceive senate bill 176, providing for the\nappointment for a special public exam\xad\niner by the governor asoccasion requires,\nwas lost, and the bill was sent back to\nthe senate. The motion was carried to\nreceive senate bill 117, Sanborn, making\nthe commandant of the soldiers home\nsecretary of the board of trustees,\nalso the motions for senate bill\n167, Laidlaw, government of county\nmutual insurance companies and senate\nbill 227, Wolbert, providing for semi\xad\nannual examination of state banks.\nLater Davis moved the reconsideration\nCELEBRATED\nSTOMACH\nPoor appetite\nis\nthe result of\nan unhealthy\na\nS re gthen\nyour digestive\norgans and\na\nlivar and kid\xad\nney sinto prop\xad\ner action with\nthe Bittters. it\nwill cure Dys\npepsia, Consti\xad\npation, Flatu\xad\nlency and pre\xad\nvents Malaria\nFever & Ague.\nrPensons having magazines or bopkB of*\ninv Irlnd thnv /facrlva nvnanmrA SbOttid\'\nany kind they desire to preserve should\'\n•have them bound.

D., March 7.—The fight in\nthe house Saturday night over capital\nremoval will be handed down as one of\nthe memorable parliamentary battles of\nthe state. For over six hours twenty\nfour members controlled fifty-nine and\nprevented a vote on the joint resolution\nto submit the amendment. During the\ntime about thirty roll calls were had—\nalmost as many as during the great pro\xad\nhibition fight of eight years ago. Be\xad\ncause of a rule adopted earlier in the\nweek, the removal question could be\npresented to the house only through a\ncommittee or by suspension of the rules.\nThe chairman of the committee on elec\xad\ntions and privileges attempted to intro\xad\nduce the bill, but was met with an\nobjection and a point of order that the\nbill could not be presented from that\ncommittee, as its subject matter was not\npertinent to the subject the committee\nwas appointed to consider. The chair\nsustained the point of order, whereupon\nMr. Bras appealed. The Pierre people\nmoved to lay the appeal on the table,\nwhich motion was lost on roll call. Then\nfollowed motions to adjourn, motions to\ntake a recess and amendments to the\nlatter, and each time the house reached\nthe appeal the motion to lay on the table\nwas renewed, followed by the same\nmotions to take a recess or adjourn.\nAbout 8 o\'clock both sides served lunch\nto their supporters in the house, and for\na short time there was a cessation of\nhostilities. The lunch masticated, they\nwent at it again, hammer and tongs, and\noccasionally there was a sharp inter\xad\nchange of courtesies between the chair\nand Seward of Watertown, Price of\nYankton and Bras of Davison, the lead\xad\ners of the majority. Benedict of Carter\nand Goddard of Sully spoke for the\nuniversity. Several times when the chair\nwas charged with being unfair he de\xad\nfended his rulings with great deliberation\nand seeming lucidness, twice claiming\nplainly he was not to blame neither was\nhe going to violate parliamentary law\nfor the purpose of helping a majority\nreach a point that could be reached\neasily under the rules if the majority\nknew how to proceed.\nAt times feeling ran high, but the\npresence of a large crowd in the lobby,\nif nothing else, prevented the carrying\nout of any idea that might have been en\xad\ntertained of ousting the speaker from\nthe chair by force. Naturally the major\xad\nity claims the speaker was wrong, but\nhe produced rules for his decisions and\ncontended the majority had no right to\nraise the point of dilatory motions when\nit was attempting to violate the law and\ntake advantage of the minority by at\xad\ntempting to bring in a bill from a com\xad\nmittee that was not competent to con\nsider it under the rules. On the whole,\nhowever, remarkably good feeling pre\nvailecP and it was clearly demonstrated\nthat the minority possessed the better\nparliamentary talent. Beyond the pass\xad\nages between Seward and Price and the\nspeaker there was little exhibition of bit\xad\nterness, although neither side lacked\nanything,in determination. Finally about\nmidnight a compromise was reached\nthat the resolution should be introduced\nand read twice before adjournment, and\nthat upon convening on Monday at 2\no\'clock the resolution would be given its\nthird reading and final passage without\nany attempt at filibustering.,\nWhen Monday\'s session opened the\nanti-Pierre combine had\'gone to pieces\n—all sorts of treachery and insincerity\nwas charged by the representatives of\none community against another and the\ncapital removal bill was-killed.\nSCOURING YOUR SCALP.\nWILL REMOVE THE LOOSE DAND\xad\nRUFF SCALES BUT IT WON\'T\nCURE DANDRUFF.\nIf your hair is brittle and thinning,\nyou have dandruff.

Otherwise cows and\nsheep differ very much. Cattle are ro\xad\nbust and of vigorous constitution, with\na comparatively low nervous ^organiza\xad\ntion. Sheep are quite otherwise, hav\xad\ning a highly nervous disposition and a\nweak constitution. Thus they are great\xad\nly disposed to diseases of the nervous\nand digestive functions. For instance,\nInstances of paralysis of the loins\namong cows are exceedingly rare, but\nquite common among sheep, and this\ndisorder is one of the great nervous\nsystem of the spine. The soft cut food\nis apt to pack in the sheep\'s stomach\nand canse a variety of diseases—stag\xad\ngers, paralysis, kidney disorders, heart\ntroubles and general inflammation\nwhich results in loosening of the wool,\nsore mouth, sore feet and several other\ndiseases of like character hence cut\nand soft food is not suitable for sheep.\nTo Rear Orphan Lambi.\nThere is no difficulty in rearing moth\xad\nerless lambs.

Feed\nsome hot milk with a spoon, and if it\nis to be fed altogether feed it on a com\xad\nmon nursing bottle on warmed cow\'s\nmilk. A fresh cow is a very useful\naddition to the outfit of a shepherd,\nand It may save a good many lambs\nwhich happen to be deprived of a\nmother or are discarded at the lamb\xad\ning time.
