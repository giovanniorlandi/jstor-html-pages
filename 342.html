        <pre>['Now For The Future \nJOHN H. FISCHER \nTeachers College, Columbia University \n \nIn this address, the President of Teachers \nCollege outlines some of the ways in which \nthe spirit of William Heard Kilpatrick \ncontributes wisdom to our confrontation of \ntoday\'s educational problems. That wisdom \nlies less in specific ideas and more in a \ncourageous and humane facing of social \nchange, less in doctrine and more in an \narticulate commitment to a world of freedom \nand opportunity. Kilpatrick\'s work is honored \nmore by its extension in the light of our novel \ncircumstances than by the preservation of \nhis boldly experimental formulations. \n \nTHE TEMPTATION IS NATURALLY Strong \ntonight to use this occasion to praise a \nfamous man. It would be both right and \npleasant to do just that, for much laudatory \nlanguage could be properly used about \nProfessor Kilpatrick. In this company of his \nfellow workers, his students, his admirers, \nand his friends, such words would, I am \nsure, evoke resounding applause. And \nsurely there could be no more fitting a place \nto speak his praise than in this very room \nwhere for so long his work was done. \n \nBut we can do better this evening than \nindulge ourselves in recalling past glories. \nThe man we honor here would prefer, I \nthink, that we look not to the past but to the \npresent and to the future, and consider how \ntomorrow and in the years ahead we can \nbest advance the work to which he has \ndevoted so many years, the task of directing \nthe process of education toward the \nworthiest goals and of making that process \nmeaningful and effective in the personal \nlives of learners and in the common life of \nthe community. \n \nA prime assertion in Dr. Kilpatrick\'s \nphilosophy has always been that education \nshould prepare the learner to live \nproductively with change. Yet one wonders \nwhether even he could possibly have \nenvisioned the extent, the speed, and the \npower of the changes that have swept the \nworld since 1898, when he first met John \nDewey, or since 1911, when he joined the \nfaculty of Teachers College. \nCONTRASTING WORLDS \n \nHow uncomplicated, how easy the issues of \nthat distant time, that other world, now \nappear from where we stand. In 1917, when \nJames B. Conant, then president of the \nAmerican Chemical Society, offered its \nservices to the Secretary of War, Mr. \nNewton D. Baker consulted his staff and \nresponded that the extra help would not be \nneeded; the War Department had a chemist. \nAt that same time, to help the Navy, \nWoodrow Wilson appointed a board of \nscientists and technical men and was \nadvised by its chairman, Thomas Edison, \nthat "We ought to have one mathematician \nfellow in case we have to calculate \nsomething out." \n \nThe exponential growth of science and \ntechnology in the past half century has \nchanged our lives in many ways, and has \nwrought what can truly be called a revolution \nin academic affairs. In the physical sciences, \nwe speak now of a knowledge-generation of \nten years, and we accept as a matter of \ncourse that major libraries must expect to \ndouble their holdings every 16 years. The \ndemand for intellectual competence affects \nnot only upper level positions but a large \npart of the entire labor force. The new status \nof the educated person reflects much less \nthe social class distinctions that diplomas \nand degrees once implied, and much more \nthe crucial dependence of our people on \nknowledge and learning. \n \nThe deliberate formation of what economists \nare calling "human capital" has become a \nmajor element in national planning. \nDesigning suitable strategies of humanresource\ndevelopment ranks among the \nprincipal issues facing every new nation and \nmost of the mature governments. \n', 'BEYOND EMERGENCIES \n \nThe demands of technological competence, \nindustrial productivity, and national security \nnow strongly influence thinking about \neducation in the United States. The \ninfluence is dramatically evident in the liberal \nfederal provision for graduate work in the \nsciences and in the terms of the first \nNational Defense Education Act in which the \nCongress expressed its view of the \nimprovements most needed in the schools. \n \nUntil very recently the changes in school \nprograms were aimed almost entirely at \nimproving the teaching of the physical \nsciences and mathematics. We have, to be \nsure, given more attention to the technical \nmastery of foreign languages. And we have \nattempted to strengthen guidance programs, \nbut this, too, has been done mainly to \nincrease the flow of promising students into \ncollege and so into the higher level scientific \nand technological occupations. \n \nMost of the decisions that we have taken, \nnot only since Sputnik, but for the past 20 \nyears, have been based on a narrow \nconception of the purposes of education. We \nhave attacked the obviously urgent tasks, \nbut too often we have overlooked the \ngenuinely important ones. In addressing \nourselves as forth-rightly as we have to the \nbusiness of producing more and better \nscientists and technologists, we have \nresponded to a need of undisputed \nseriousness. But whether we are doing what \nwe should and can to prepare capable \npolitical leaders and the well educated \ngeneralists that citizens and parents ought \nto be is a question we cannot answer with \nequal confidence. \n \nWe react to emergency needs, but \notherwise we take the purposes of education \nfor granted and fail to examine with sufficient \ndepth or wisdom the sort of nation our \nsuccessive ad hoc decisions will inevitably \nlead us to become. We have concentrated \nupon the relatively simple task of finding and \ndeveloping manpower to support technology \nand defense and have too often forgotten to \nask how the means of education should be \nused to liberate and magnify the powers and \nthe possibilities of all men. \n \nThis is, of course, no new question. \nTeachers and philosophers have been \nasking it for centuries. Yet, ironically, the \npermanent relevance that justifies its claim \nfor our attention is also the principal reason \nthat we overlook it. The new issues arising \nfrom science and technology present \nthemselves with an urgency so spectacular \nas to obscure the much more fundamental \nquestions that center on the nature of man \nhimself and how his fulfillment might be \nbetter served. \nMAN THE CENTER \n \nThe time is overdue to recognize that \nscience, important as it is, cannot be \nallowed to continue its almost exclusive \ndomination of educational planning. We \nshall do well to remember, to use Jacques \nBarzun\'s words, "The indispensability of \nman for every purpose." \n \nNot simply to balance the curriculum, but for \nmuch better reasons, we must now \nreexamine and strengthen the place of the \nhumanities in the schools. Nor does it make \nmuch sense to argue that literature and \nhistory should be emphasized mainly \nbecause they are good solid subjects and \nadd further rigor to school programs. This is \nnot to argue against sound academic \nsubstance or rigorous intellectual effort. It is \nrather to propose that we be as clear as we \ncan be about our purposes, clarifying for \nourselves as teachers no less than for our \npupils and the public, why the humanities \nare important in the curriculum and—what is \neven more to the point—what difference a \nsound acquaintance with them might make \nin a man\'s life—or his nation\'s. \n \nIt is necessary continuously to remind \nourselves and each other that to know \nsomething of what good and able men think \nabout justice, freedom, virtue, beauty, truth, \nis to become a wiser man oneself; that \nwithout the benefit of such wisdom and its \nrespectful nurture the institutions of a free \nsociety, and especially those that serve \nproductive and creative inquiry, have small \nhope to survive, much less to flourish. \n \n', 'The Commission on the Humanities puts the \nmatter well in its recent report: \n \nEven the most gifted individual, whether \npoet or physicist, will not realize his full \npotential or make his fullest contribution to \nhis times unless his imagination has been \nkindled by the aspirations and \naccomplishments of those who have gone \nbefore him. Humanist scholars have \ntherefore a special responsibility in that the \npast is their natural domain. They have the \nprivilege and obligation of interpreting the \npast to each new generation of men who \n"necessarily must live in one small corner for \none little stretch of time." They preserve and \njudge the fruits of humanity\'s previous \nattempts to depict, to rationalize, and to \ntranscend the world it inhabits. The arts and \nletters, and the study of them, are therefore \nwhere we look most directly for enrichment \nof the individual\'s experience and his \ncapacity for responding to it. Through the \nhumanities we may seek intellectual \nhumility, sensitivity to beauty, and emotional \ndiscipline. By them we may come to know \nthe excitement of ideas, the power of \nimagination, and the unsuspected energies \nof the creative spirit. \n \nWe can mark with some satisfaction the \ngrowing interest in a curriculum aimed at a \nbroader educational purpose than satisfying \nthe demands of the employment market. We \ncan sustain that interest and reinforce it with \nour own effort. \nASSAULT ON POVERTY \n \nA second welcome current of change now \nreshaping the work of our schools affects \ndirectly only a segment of our population, \nbut the situation that gives rise to it is of \ndeep concern to all of us. I speak here of the \ngrowing interest in problems of the least \nfavored groups among our people—the \nunschooled, the slum dwellers, those we call \nthe culturally disadvantaged, those stricken \nnot merely by poverty of purse, but by the \ngrievous poverty of spirit. \n \nYet we must be careful not to be carried \naway by the illusion that having discovered \nthe shortcomings of slum schools, we are \nnecessarily on our way toward solving the \nproblems they present. It would be nearer to \nthe truth to say that the problems of the \nslums have found the schools rather than to \nput it the other way around. For with all the \nprogress we can claim so far to have made \nin spreading the benefits of universal \neducation to larger numbers of our children, \nan unpleasant fact remains. Few public \nschool systems and few scholars outside the \nschools have in the past given anyconsistent\nor concerted attention to the \nspecial problems of the culturally \nhandicapped until circumstances have made \nsuch action unavoidable. \n \nThe task far exceeds what the professionals \nwho staff the schools can hope to \naccomplish by themselves. Nor should the \nschool people be expected to undertake the \nwork alone. The role of the public school in \nour society is so close to the center of all our \nefforts to build a good society that everyone \nwith a stake in the future of that society and \nany sense of responsibility toward it must be \nwilling to play his part in strengthening its \nschools. \n \nOn Wednesday of this week (18 November, \n1964), Dr. Conant, speaking to the chief \nstate school officers, observed that very few \npeople appear now to be seriously \ninterested in the education of any children \nexcept their own. The professionals who \nspend their lives in schools furnish an \nindispensable part of the effort to make the \nschools what they might be, but the broad \nwelfare of the schools and of the children \nthey serve must be the concern as much of \nthe citizens in general and of the political \nleaders in particular as of teachers, \nadministrators, and school board members. \n \nThe difficulty is not that the schools have \nhad too little public attention. Indeed, they \nhave had more of it in the recent past than \nthey have ever known before. But the \nattention has centered too exclusively on \ntheir weaknesses when more of it would \nbetter have been turned to their \npotentialities. Some of the time and energy \nwe spend criticizing the teachers and their \ntechniques could be more fruitfully devoted \nto thinking about the purposes of education \nand planning strategies for achieving them. \nThere is a regrettable reluctance among \nmany of our leaders to give much thought to \n', "the purposes of education or to the role of \nthe public schools in achieving the goals \nmost relevant to our destiny as a people. \nDismissing the issue by agreeing that \neducation is whatever goes on in school is \njust not good enough. \nFUNDAMENTAL AIMS \n \nTo deal effectively with the power of \neducation, we must specify with reasonable \nclarity and seriousness the purposes the \nschools are to pursue. This is obviously a \nquestion on which there can be wide \ndifference of opinion, but when the terms \nhave been defined and the jargon filtered \nout, we are likely to agree on at least three \nmain goals we want our schools to serve. \nThey will probably sound about like this: \n \nTo help every pupil to make the most of his \ncapacities \n \nTo enable him to acquire the intellectual \nskills necessary for a life of continuous \nlearning \n \nTo prepare him to find for himself a \nproductive, significant, responsible role in \nthe world and to offer him reasonable hope \nthat he may fill that role with satisfaction to \nhimself and to his fellow men. \n \nMaking up our minds about what ought to be \ndone is only the first step, however, toward \nbringing it to pass. The programs by which \nwe proceed from where we are to where we \nwant to be must begin with a large-scale \nextension of what we are now able to do. No \none who examines the current state of \nAmerica's schools can fail to be impressed \nby the vast agenda of unfinished business \nwe face or by the fact that much of what is \nneeded calls for knowledge and skills we do \nnot now possess. But much can be \naccomplished by the relatively simple step of \nmultiplying what we already know how to do. \n \nThe gains that have been made in \nthousands of American schools in the past \ndecade exceed what even the optimists \nthought possible only a few years before the \nchanges began. New materials, more \nflexible organization, and imaginative \nteaching have produced remarkable results \nin thousands of elementary schools. In one \nhigh school after another, the curricula not \nonly for abler students but for ordinary \ncollege-bound youngsters have been \nstrengthened so effectively that almost every \ncollege faculty is now engaged in upgrading \nits freshman offerings. The progress has \nbeen best, of course, in the fields and in the \nschools where the greatest effort has been \ninvested. \n \nThere remain, unfortunately, thousands of \nschools where poor support, bad working \nconditions, and low-grade leadership still \nseriously limit the opportunities of boys and \ngirls. In many of these cases, the students \ndo not need special curricula but would \nrespond to the same improvements that are \nbenefiting their contemporaries in more \nfortunate schools. With better professional \nand political leadership and stronger citizen \nsupport, the advantages now enjoyed by a \nfraction of our young people could be \ndisseminated to millions more. \nNEED FOR NOVELTY \n \nIt would be naive, however, to suggest that \neven a massive multiplication of the best we \nnow know will solve all our problems. Some \nof the so-called innovation programs in the \nlarger cities rely far too heavily on simply \ndoing more of the same. A central part of \nany genuine effort to meet the problems that \nwe have only recently recognized as part of \nthe schools' obligation must include the \ndeliberate encouragement of new and \nunorthodox approaches. The requirement \nfor originality and courageous innovation is \nso overridingly important that it will require \nnew combinations of public sponsorship and \nindependent enterprise. To move and \nchange more swiftly than the typical public \nagency is able to respond, it may be well to \nconsider establishing a new type of \nexperimental school with some public \nsupport but with the freedom of action that \ncan probably be obtained only under \nindependent control. Such an institution \nmight be established for a limited term of \nperhaps ten years, after which it would be \nabsorbed into the public school system. \nDuring this period, it could be operated by a \nuniversity or a specially constituted board, or \nunder the auspices of a jointly sponsored \n", 'research and development center such as \nthe one now being contemplated for the \nNew York area. If a deliberate effort were \nmade to enroll in such a school a typical \ncross-section of urban students, if a creative \nfaculty of the highest caliber could be \nrecruited, adequate financing provided, and \nthe assistance of competent specialists \nfurnished from a wide range of appropriate \nacademic and professional fields, then the \nresults would almost surely exceed anything \nconceivable within existing public or private \nschool organizations. \n \nWe might find it possible in such an \ninstitution actually to realize the goal Dewey \nsuggested at the turn of the century—a \nschool truly representing "what the best and \nwisest parent desires for his own child" and \none that the community could realistically \n"want for all its children." \n \nIt will be necessary also, however, to set in \nmotion more long-range programs of basic \nand applied research in education. Steps in \nthis direction are already under way but they \nmust be expanded rapidly, progressively, \nand imaginatively. Many more universities \nthan have yet shown the necessary interest \nwill have to become deeply committed to the \ninvestigation of problems in education and to \nthe improvement of the schools. \n \nA few professors in the traditional academic \nfields and a growing number of behavioral \nscientists are leading the way, but some of \nthem have taken on their new found work in \nthe schools only as an avocational interest, \na sort of professional hobby. What is needed \nnow is a broader acceptance of such \nresponsibility among more of the most \ncapable academicians, a willingness to \nrecognize the reciprocal obligation of all the \nlevels of the educational enterprise to each \nother. We have only scratched the surface \nof the possibilities that lie in fruitful, \ncollaborative effort among specialists in the \nacademic fields, in the social and behavioral \nsciences, in the specialties of education, and \nin the operation of schools. \nFOR BETTER TEACHERS \n \nWisely planned and exploited, all of the \nefforts I have discussed can contribute to \nrevised, reoriented, and invigorated \nprograms of teacher-education. \nImprovement of this sort is already evident, \nhaving been under way for a number of \nyears, but much hard work still lies before \nus. Teacher-education in too many places \nstill looks defensively backward rather than \naggressively ahead. While every profession \nmust profit from its past experience and \nshould take pride in its accomplishments, \nthe value of both experience and \naccomplishment can be enhanced by \nobjective and penetrating appraisal. \n \nThose who have built the field of teachereducation\nin America have just cause for \npride in their achievements. They have, let it \nnever be forgotten, provided the teachers to \nstaff an educational enterprise unequaled \nanywhere in either the magnitude or the \ndiversity of its tasks. Attention to the \nweakness of American teaching must never \nbe allowed to obscure the magnificent \naccomplishments with which it must be \ncredited. Yet, for all the good things we may \nrightly claim to have accomplished, it is at \nleast debatable whether we can take equal \npride in the zeal or the capacity we have \ndemonstrated for criticizing our own \nperformance. It is as true of teachereducation\nas of any other work that the \nnecessary complement of creativity is \ncriticism. Here we have at hand a powerful if \nnot a secret weapon for fighting the good \nfight that every tomorrow must bring. And \nthere is no good reason that we should fear \nto use it. \n \nWilliam Heard Kilpatrick and his colleagues \non this campus led a movement that was \nnotable for many reasons. We cannot carry \nit forward on precisely the terms they found \nmost suitable, nor can we meet the issues of \nthis period by simply repeating what seemed \nappropriate for the twenties. But we shall do \nwell to recall two major elements in the \nprogressive movement and to mark their \ncontinuing relevance now and for the future. \n \nOne is the unequivocal assertion that \nnothing—no consideration, no expedient, no \npressure—equals in the school the \ntranscendent importance of the student as \nan individual. If we ever forget that, it will \nlittle matter how well we master our \nsubjects, how ingeniously we organize our \n', 'classes, or how skillfully we program our \ncomputers; for we shall have lost our \ndirection, and every increase in our power \nwill only magnify our error. \n \nA second element in progressive education \nthat we can continue to remember with \nbenefit is that the people who represented \nthe best of that effort knew what it was they \nmeant to do. Whether one agrees or not with \nall the objectives they sought, their purposes \nwere clear to themselves, to their \nassociates, and when their work was well \ndone, to their students. Insistence on clarity \nabout purpose was a cardinal consideration \nin their work. Let us hope that in the \nconfused tensions of our time we might now \ndo as well. \n \nI return to the thought with which I began. \nWe meet tonight to mark the birthday of an \nestimable man, a gentleman of learning, a \nteacher whose influence upon his students \nhas been, quite literally, incalculable. We \nhonor him most fittingly, therefore, not in \nwhat we say to praise him, but in what we \ndo to forward the work to which he has \ndevoted a full and useful career. In the \nperson of William Heard Kilpatrick we \ncelebrate this evening the power every good \nteacher possesses to \nfulfill the promises of freedom. \n']</pre>
