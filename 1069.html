Ho\nwalked out of tho place then, his grim\nstlonco adding now uneasiness to hla\nanxious watchors.\nInn, pale and sad looking, was start\ning to leave the ofllco for lunch when\nNod approached her In tho anteroom.\n"Can I havo a word with you, Miss\nValle?" ho inquired.\n"Why, certainly," replied Ina, who\nalways liked tho young fellow.\n"You havo been a good frlond to\nme," ho said with sincerity and hu\nmility. "I am In deep distress and I\nfeel that I must make n confidant of\nyou. I am responslblo for tho troublo\nhero this morning, I am Borry to say."\n"I did not know that," replied Ina,\nwith truo sisterly sympathy.\n"Well, I am. I havo been a foolish,\ndisloyal fellow to tho kindest man\nthat ever lived, Mr. Gresham, and ho\nknows it. Oh! nty sins aro not very\nheavy, but I havo wasted tlmo, gone\nwith riotous companions and other\nwise disappointed him. Ho was hint\ning at mo when ho burst out so this\nmorning," and Ned, with honest tears\nof contrition In his eyes, told Ina tho\nwholo story, ending up with: "For\ntho sake of you others I guess I had\nbetter go somowhero and make a\nman of myself."\n"You will do nothing of tho sort!"\ndeclared Ina. "There is too much good\nIn you to throw yourself away. Go\nstraight to Mr. Gresham, tell him all\nyou havo told me, turn over a new\nleaf and mako hlra happy."\n"I\'ll do it, and I\'ll reform, I vow I\nwill!" cried Ned earnestly.\nIt was lato In tho day when Ina\ntimidly entered tho room of her em\nployer, little dreaming of how favor\nably Ned Warner had paved tho way\nfor a gracious reception. Sho noted\na marked change In his faco as he\nlooked up.\n"Mr. Gresham," she said, "I havo\ndecided not to wait until the end of\ntho month, but leave today."\n"Why, hadn\'t you better stay for a\nfew days? My wife will be back from\ntho country Thursday, and then be\ntween you thero can be arrangements\nmade."\n"For what?" gasped the perplexed\nIna.\n"Why, I supposed you -would be glad\nto havo her co-operation as to tho\ntrousseau und tho wedding arrange\nments "\n"Why!" gasped tho petrified Ina,\n"didn\'t you dlschargo mo this morn\ning?" "What\'s that? Me? Ha, ia! ho,\nno: mess me, my dear young lad\' !\nWhat ever put that into your hend?\nI simply suggested that, as you was\ngoing to bocomo our daughter, It was\nbest that you exchange office life for\nthe home. Yes, indeed Just so!"\nAnd, despite the fact that ho was\nnot entirely telling tho truth, there\nwas such a kind, fatherly look in his\ngood-natured eyea that Ina did not\nhavo tho heart to gainsay him.\n(Copyright, 19H. by "V.

Amnions, governor of\nColorado, came ncro&s \'vitii a story\nabout two metropolitan brokers.\nThe brokers were having an uftcr\nlnnclirnn smoke one afternoon, and\nout\' f iliciii became reminiscent.\n"II. wvU do I rcmomber when 1\nwas a barefoot lnd," observed the\nliri) pr.

"They scorched\nmy hands with the rope, they upset\nme, they maided me and they walked\nall over me."\n"I don\'t doubt it in the least," re\nturned tho second. "Unruly dispo\nsitions, I suppose?"\n"No, it wasn\'t that," replied the\nfirst. "It was a case of wonderful\ninstinct. They sized me up at a\nglance as a small stockholder and\nknew what is generally done to small\nstockholders."\nGO THE LIMIT IN SHAVING\nNatives of India Exceptionally Liberal\nIn Their Use of the Keen\nEdged Razor.\nTho natives of India go in a great\ndeal for shaving, and do not confine\nthcmelvos to merely shaving the\nchin, but on occasion will shave the\neyebrows, as well, and in the case of\ncertain ritos and ceremonies, the\nhead, too, is completely shaved.\nNo soap, Is used, but the beard is\nsoftened by being rubbed over with a\nlittle cold water. The razors em\nployed are generally of native manu\nfacture and have fixed handles that\ndo not fold ; moreover, they are very\nmuch heavier than those of European\nmake. The strop consists of a small\npiece of leather the size of a man\'s\npalm, and is held in tho open hand\nduring stropping.\nThe Tecognized cost of a shave is\none pice, which \'is the exact equiva\nlent of one farthing. With western\neducation, however, \'conditions are\nrapidly changing, and many native\ngentlemen now shave themselves.\nThe advent of safety razors will\ndoubtless do much toward breaking\ndown prejudice among natives\nagainst shaving themselves.\nUNFORTUNATE PHRASE.\n"Franz der Kaiser," Napoleon\'s\nfather-in-law, who was a rather weak\nand silly ruler, had, nevertheless, a\nthoroughgoing belief in alvsolutism,\nund in tho divine right to rule of\neven the most incompetent of the\nllapsburgs. His abilities, such as\nthey were, were best displayed in\ncatechisms that he wrote and printed\nfor the use of his humbler subjects\nand in peevish criticisms of those of\nsuperior\' intelligence.\nAccording to the author of a re\ncent life of Archduchess Maria I)u\nisa of Austria, entitled, "An Impe\nrial Victim," the emperor once raged\nagainst his doctor , for\' remarking\nthat he had "a good constitution."\n"Never let me hoar that word\nagain !" lie said.

Two spied had\nbeen captured on the banks of the\nRappahannock. One was a Yankee,\nthe other of German birth. They\nwere condemned to be haiiged to the\nbranch of a trco that projected out\nover the river, since such a death\nwould save their executioners tho\ntrouble of burying them. It would\nmerely bo necessary to saw away tho\nbranch and let the bodies drop into\nthe water.\nThe Yankee\'s turn came first. Ho\nstill had a five-dollar bill in his.\npocket, and he pressed it into the\nhangman\'s hand with the whispered\nwords, "For heaven\'s sake, use a\nfrayed ropcl"\nTho hangman did bo. As soon as\nthe Yankee was strung up the rotten\nrope broke and the condemned man\nfell into the wator. He was a good\nswimmer, and so he managed to\nreach tho opposite bank, which was\nwitiiin tho lines of his own army.\nThe German, when he saw what\nbad happened, turned to the hang\nman with a voice that trembled with\nfiar.

If one\ngives to the sun a co-eillclont of ex\npansion intermediate between that of\nmercury and that of gas, one arrives\nat the conclusion that It has taken\none million to three million years\nfor the sun to contract to Its present\nradius; iu particular, it would have\ntaken ten thousand years to contract\nfrom infinity to a radius twlco its\npresent radius.
