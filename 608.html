        <pre>['!7\nv*\n,&\nForty years ago, in a email room of\na house at 17 Delancey street, New\nYork city, the Benevolent and Protect\nive Order of Elks was born.\nIt is to the stage and the people of\nthe stage that the Elks owe their exist\nance. The founders had no thought\nthat the order would ever reach its\npresent gigantic proportions, and\nalthough it has long since outgrown\nthe limitations that made members of\nthe theatrical profession alone eligible\nfor membership, the organization has\never been in sympathetic touch with\nthe people of the stage.\nThe excise laws that were passed by\nthe legislature of New York in 1866\nled incidentally to the founding of\nthe Elks. Actors, as a rule, are a\njovial, free-hearted set, and with a\nrigid enforcement of the excise laws\nthey were deprived of one of their few\nsorces of amusement. Sunday was\nthe only day in the week the actor at\nthat time could call his own, and as\nhis mind demanded relaxation from\nthe cares of the week he generally\nsought the companionship of kindred\nBeautiful Scenes\n...A\'\n*L\n&"-isT/-. *\'.\'*\'*\'\'\'Iff*\nBEMIDJI EXTENDS\nIS\nvp&ai\n583\n*$Z\na&&\nHB85\n4\n&*\n&$ &\nw^ TL\nWW\n,1?\n-14\nCHIEF BEMIDJI\n(SHAY-NOW-ISH-KUNG)\nThe city of Bemidji was named after "Shay-now-ish-kung," better known, as "Chief BemidJT,"\'\nwho was a member of the Cass Lake band of Chippewa Indians, and whose likeness appears herewith.\nBemidji was one of the last of the line of chiefs who have ruled the Cass Lake reservation for\ncenturies.\nChief Bemidji for years lived on the lake which bears his name, and he was known everywhere as\nthe "peaceful Chippewa," having always been a friend of the whites.\nChief Bemidji is dead, and his body lies in Greenwood cemetery, just, outside the suburbs of the\ncity which bears his name, and his last resting place is marked by a fine monument, erected to his\nmemory by the citizens of Bemidji.\nspirits in the profession to discuss the\nlatest gossip of the theater, the advent\nof some new star, the prospects of the\ncoming season and the discussions, of\ncourse, partook of the fashion and\ncustom of the world of unconvention\nally. The new e*cise law came like a\nbombshell on those assemblies, and\nnot only scattered the participants, but\nput an end to all the old places of\nmeeting.\nFor a while the actors were at a loss\nwhat to do. Their meetings had be\ncome so regular, although they had no\norganization, and they had become\nso cemented together in the bonds of\ngoodfellowship that the deprivation\nmade them feel instinctively the\nneed of a socail organization. How\nto acomplish that result, however, did\nnot present itself to any of their minds\nfor quite a while afterwards, when it\nwas finally resolved to form a. society\npatterned somewhat after the Buf\nfaloes, a famous English conival or\nganization composed entirely of\nactors.\nThe new society took the somewhat\nVOLUME 6.

At\nfirst only a few were banded together.\nEach week a purse was raised by\nsmall contributions fromthe members\nwhich was used to pay for the meeting\nroom and buy refreshments and lunch\nfor the company.\nIt was at the boarding house of Mrs.\nGiesman, at 188 Elm street, New York,\nthat the first meetings of the Corks\nwere held. Mrs. Giesman\'s house was\nat that time famous resort for a\nnumber of choice spirits, among whom\nwere several musicians and others\nconnected with the theatrical profes\nsion. These, with a few congenial\nassociates, were in the habit of as\nsembling in her parlor Sunday after\nnoons and spending the time in social\nintercourse. It was at one of these\nmeetings the associaion was given\na permanent form, and the first officers\nBemidji, the county seat ot Bel\ntrami county, is a city of 5,500\ninhabitants.\nThe city is midway between\nDuluth and Crookston and is the\ncentral city of the north half of the\nstate.\nBemidji is charmingly situated\non the shores of two beautiful and\npicturesque bodies of water, the\nlarger, Lake Bemidji, being some\nthing over six miles long and from\ntwo to three miles wide it borders\nthe east edge of the city extending\nnorth and south.

Charles A.

The idea\nmet with general 4avor**and it was de\ncided to form a society with a broader\nscope and a nobler purpose. A\ncommittee of seven was appointed\nwith full power to provide a constitu\ntion, ritual, by-lays and a name for\nthe new order. The committee con\nsisted of George W. Thompson, Wil\nliam Lloyd Bowron, George E. Mc\nDonald, William Sheppard T.Grattan\nRiggs, James Glenn and Henry Vande\nmark, who, after several weeks\' labor,\nreported a constitution, ritual and\nby-laws, and recommended the name\nof the Benevolent and Protective\nOrder of Elks.

Nearly every\nlodge in the state is a member of the\nassociation, and it is expected that\nthose which are not members will come\ninto the fold during the Bemidji meet\ning.\n,.iJ\nmost desirable residential section\nof Bemidji, although other sections\nas Swell, possess numerous fine\ndwellings.

To be Identified with\nthis great brotherhood is of itself\nan honor, and therefore it must of\nnecessity be a pleasure for us to meet\nannually with good fellows from all\nparts of the state. The state associa\ntion is to Minnesota what the Grand\nLodge is to the parent organization,\nand to many of us it is the- annual\nhome coming when we again meet\nsocially with Elks from all Darts of\nthe state, who are enlisted with us in\ncarrying out the great principles of\nour order, namely Charity, Justice,\nBrotherly Love and Fidelity.\nAs we are proud of our organiza\ntion and the good it accomplishes, so\nshould we all be proud of the State\nAssociation, and we should indicate\nour loyalty to the principles of th\norder by attending every recurring\nreunion, where we can meet and\nexchange ideas and thoughts with the\nthe thousands of good Elks who are\ncontinually scattering roses in the\npathway of their less fortunate\nbrothers, and by word or deed are\ndoing something to make the name of\nElk a lasting and a pleasant remem\nbrance to him that does and to him\nthat receive3.\nI have frequently heard the remark,\n"He\'s an Elk and a good fellow!" Is\nit any wonder that the expression is a\nsynonym? To be a \'good fellow from\nmv standpoint, means to be a good\nloyal, liberty-loving citizen, A man\nwho looks upon the brightest side of\nlife, whose face is enlivened with a\nsmile, who belives in doing unto others\nas he would have others do\nunto him, who always finds time to\nvisit the sick and bereaved, and is\nnever so poor in pocket that he can\nnot find someone a little bit poorer\nwith^ whom he is willing to share his\nlast^pust.\' }Of course, the Elks are\n\'"good Jellows," and the expression is\none" in which we should find the\ngreatest comfort and take the greatest\npride.\nThe annual reunion to be held at\nBemidji on June 18, 19 and 20 will\nhope be the grandest reunion of the\nassociation ever held in Minnesota,\nand I hope that by our actions as men\nand Elks wewilledntinue to merit the\nhigh standard of esteem in which our\norder is held, not only by Elks, but by\nthe public generally. We, at a dis\ntance, havs heard many good things\nabout the Elks of Bemidji, and it will\nafford us much pleasure to join with\nthem in the fourth annual reunion and\na Grand, Good Time, which we know\nis in store.\nFraternally Yours,\nN.

From\nyear to year more and more is required as to\'\nthe teacher\'s qualifications, and she may well\nfeel proud of the fact that such is true, in\nthat she has It within herself to meet those\nqualifications.

Board and\nroom can be had in private families at a reason\nable rate. Teachers can secure a room and\nboard themselves, or bring a tent and camp on\nthe shore of the lake. The latter Is a very\ncheap way where a tent can be secured without\ncost. With a tent and a small camp outfit the\ncost of living is very small. A list of those\nfurnishing rooms and board can be found at\nthe office of county superintendent.\nENROLLMENT.\nThe enrollment will begin Monday June 22nd,\nat nine o\'clock at the High School building.\nAll those enrolled the first day or by nine\no\'clock Tuesday morning will be considered per\nfect in attendance if not otherwise absent.\nTeachers should come early and have the work\nassigned at once.

The application of each school must show*\nthat it has maintained its standard of efficiency,\nboth in equipment and work and that some im\nprovement has been made during the year. The\nschool grounds must be Icept neat and clean\nand present an orderly and attractive appear\nance. Each building should have two properly\nbuilt and kept outhouses some distance apart.\nNote.The department of public instruction\nwill send Bulletin on request.\nSTATE AI FO LIBRARIES.\nVery few teachers or boards seem to realize\nhow much aid they or the community at large\nmay get thro a good library, or how easy it is\nto procure the same for their schools.\nIn the remote communities books are scarce\nIn the homes, and children either do not read\nbecause they have nothing to read that is suited\nto their years, or else they read any books or\npapers which come to their hands. These are\noften the kind of literature which gives them\na distorted view of life and arouse their interest\nin contaminating and repulsive conditions when\ntheir minds should be free from all evil. No\nteacher or board should allow this when books\ncan be obtained so easily.\nAt the first purchase of books, the State will\nfurnish a dollar for every dollar provided by\nthe school, not exceeding $20.00 for the first\nyear\'s purchase thus enabling a district which\nfurnishes $10.00 to receive $20.00 worth of\nbooks and a district which furnishes $20.00 to\nreceive $40.00 worth.\nEvery following year the state will give the\ndistrict $10.00 for that purpose, providing the\ndistrict furnishes at least the same amount.\nEvery teacher can raise $10.00 for that pur\npose. A subscription list circulated, a social, or\na school entertainment given with the under\nstanding that the funds go for books often nets\nthe school from $15.00 to $60.00, and the whole\ncommunity receives a benefit that can not be\nestimated.\nWhat has been done, can be done. A the\nchild\'s whole life may be made- or marred by\nwhat It reads if it has not the proper reading.\nAre you as teacher or board not responsible for\nthat life?\nAs boards have you done your share in rais\ning this money, or have you kept taxes down re\ngardless of the mental and moral life of the\nchild?\nDo not shift your responsibility upon the\nboardteachers. They are often so financially\nhandicapped that they can not do as they would.\nUnite with them and work together and in the\nstrength of union you ay do great things for\nthe future men and women of the land.\nCOMPULSORY EDUCATION.\nThe law regarding compulsory education de\nclares that all children between seven and\nfourteen must be in school constantly if their\nhealth permits, all children between fourteen\nand eighteen must be in school unless excused\nby the board.\nWhy does the state require this?\nThe normal child has within him two opposite\npossibilities, the development of which depends\nquite largely upon his early environment. The\nchild brought up in a clean, strong, intellectual\nand moral environment will become a strong\nman morally, intellectually, politically and in\ndustrially. The child brought up amid opposite\nconditions will become utterly unable to cope\nwith the industrial conditions of his time, will\nbe generally dependent upon some one else in\nmatters of business and peculiarly open to im\nmoral influences. Hi vote, determined largely\nby the opinions of others, is apt to be unihtelll\ngent, embittered by the consequences of un\nequal Industrial strife, he becomes an easy\nprey to the political juggler and a menace to\ngood government. ^/\\x ||f|\nThis last "condition must not Tier Since the\nschool is provided to give the child the proper\nmental and moral equipment for the battle\nof life, thestate makes the above aw and puts\nIt In our hands to enforce. W therefore\nmust see that the child is In school during the\nformative period of his life, if his health per\nmits.\nFar too many children are absent during this\nImportant period because of an inexcusable lack\nof responsibility on the part of the parent, a\nconsequent lftBc of interest upon the part of the\nchild, and a failure to arouse Interest In the\nschool work upon the part of the teacher.\nMMI\n^-:f^V\'^%^"\nr-\\\n\'i i\nifrt-\nEvery teacher should examine her work, and.\nif lacking, improve the conditions at once. See\nthat the board compels the children to come to\nschool and then Interest them and hold them\nthere. This is the teacher\'s work, and the\nteacher alone is responsible.\nAfter the child is fourteen he may ask for a\nschool record to present to the board showing\nthat he has completed the fundamental pro\ncesses in all branches. Before, you give him this\nrecord be sure he is able to think clearly, to\nread understandingly, to write plainly, to ex\npress\nhimself well In both written and spoken\nEnglish, and understands enough of arithmetic\nto protect himself in the simpler financial\'\ntransactions.\nAfter that the responsibility passes to the\nboard. The board should fully realize this and\nfulfil their duty. They should hire teachers that\ncan interest the children in their school work,\nprovide truant officers when necessary, and in\nvestigate all conditions of absence thoroly.\nThe board may, according to law, excuse\nchildren from attendance for the following\nreasons:\nFirst. That the child is in such bodily and\nmental condition as to prevent his attendance\nat school or his application to study.\nSecond. That he is properly taught at home.\nThird. That he has already acquired such\nbranches.\nFourth. That he is engaged in some useful\nand lawful occupation.\nFifth. That there is no school within reason\nable distance of his residence.\nSixth. That such person is unable to clothe\nsuch child on account of poverty.\nIf the board are asked to excuse any child\nfor any of the previous reasons they should be\nsure that the parent Is justified in his claim.\nNothing less than a doctor\'s certificate of the\nbodily and mental condition of a child should\nbe accepted. Many a fond parent excuses a lazy\nchild when there is no reason for it.\nBe sure, if the child is taught elsewhere, to\nrequire proofs that he is as well taught as he\nwould be In the schools. Just as exacting\nregarding the certificate proving that he has\nfinished the branches taught in common school,\nand unless the parents need the financial aid,\nalways keep the child in school for his sake.\nMany a parent is lazy or avaricious enough\nto ask a child\'s aid in supporting a family when\nthey could do it themselves if they would.\nWhat little the parent gains Is nothing com\npared with what the child loses for he will be\nunder far too great temptations for his years\nand will be at a disadvantage all the rest of\nhis life, impoverished both mentally and phys\nically.\nAny officer failing to investigate all cases of\nviolation of the law or neglecting to secure such\nprosecution within ten days after service on\nhim by any tax payer of the district of written\nnotice of such offense, unless the persons com\nplained of Is legally excused, shall be liable\nto a fine of not less than $20.00 and not more\nthan $50.00. __ _. ^vlidiZlM\nTHIRD ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SCHOOL\nBOARDS.\nBemidjl, Minn., July 17th, 1808.\nTo School Officers:\nThe school law provides that the county\nsuperintendent ay call meetings of the school\nofficers of the county for one day, for consulta-\nHere\'s what we mean by a thoroughly\nequipped shoe department, one that shows\nthe highest values in town at every price. $g\nAt $4 the Walk-Over Oxfords, black and\ntan of every leather.
