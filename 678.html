If their\nstory is true the Minneapolis police\nhave struck the wrong trail and it\nshatters all theories of the murders\nwhich have hitherto been held and\nleaves the police absolutely at sea\nfor even a theory for the motive for\nthe crime and the identity of the crim\xad\ninals. The facts as told by Kuzman\nSiekuloff, the leader of the band, are\nthese:\nCame From Northern Turkey.\nFor the last year or more there has\nbeen a band of Bulgarians from the\nprovince of Presbad, in the northern\npart of Turkey, working in the woods\nand camps of Northern Minnesota.\nThe members of this band were all\nfrom the same part of the province\nand were headed by Siekuloff, who\nacted in the capacity of padrone or\nleader.

Stojer and Siekuloff were the\nonly ones who had spent any length\nof time in this country, the others\nhaving come direct from New York,\nwhere they landed. Some of the old\nmembers, according to Siekuloff\'s\nstory, went down to the train with the\nparty and saw them safely off. That\nwas the last seen of the six alive and\nSiekuloff and the members of his party\nare at a loss to know the cause of the\nmurders.\nIgnorant of\'Cause for Crime.\nSiekuloff, when questioned, claimed\nthat all of the men were very good\nfriends and professed entire ignorance\nas to what could have been the cause\nof the murders. He says that there\nlire no other Bulgarians in this part of\nthe country. He knows of no crim\xad\ninal organization or feud that could\nhave prompted the murders. All had\nmoney, having been working for two\nmonths at Alborn. Of the six men\nleft at Minneapolis four were brothers\nnamed Jaless. Asked if they had had\ntrouble with any persons in Minneap\xad\nolis he said they had not.

The work of the past year and\nwhat is hoped to be accomplished is\noutlined in the address of President\nGriffith as follows:\nThe North Dakota Enforcement\nleague meets in convention today, it\nbeing the Eleventh anniversary of its\norganization. Heretofore the conven\xad\ntion ha9 been held alternately in Far-\nand GTand Forks. But the officers\nof the convention are awake to the\nfact that these two cities are not the\nonly commercial centers of the state.\nNor are they the centers of greatest\npopulation. The executive committee\'\nimportance of this beautiful city ofi\nMinot. Hhey recognize also that the\nwestern part of the state will have the\ngreatest influence in determining\nwhat shall be our state\'s future des\xad\ntiny. Whatever policy shall be adopt\xad\ned by the people in this section of the\nstate will in all probability ultimately\nThose of you Who have lived here\nduring the early days of our state\xad\nhood will remember that ours was the\nfirst state to enter the Union as a pro\xad\nhibition state and with the sale of\nliquor outlawed. A prohibitory clause\nwas incorporated in our constitution\nand the law providing penalty for\nsame went into effect July 1890. So\nthat we have had fifteen years of\nprohibition. Early settlers will re\xad\nmember that many gloomy pre\xad\ndictions were made by those opposed\nto prohibition. They said that the\ngrass would very soon grow in the\nstreets of Grand Forks, Fargo and the\nether cities\nOl\nHow is that for growth and develop\xad\nment, without one salooa?\nThe farm products of North Dakota\nfor 1904 were sufficient to give every\nman, woman and child in tne state,\n$314.32. This is the highest average\nof auy state in the Union—and no\nsaloons! In 1890 there were 34 banks\nin the state. We now have 423 of\nwhich 326 are state banks and 97\nnational banks.\nThe question, why was this league\norganized, doubtless arises in the\nminds of many who are not conver\xad\nsant with the early condition of af\xad\nfairs in this state. I would reply to\nthat question that this league was or\xad\nganized to stimulate and encourage\nofficials in the performance of their\nduty and to create public sentiment\nin favor of the prohibitory law. In\nthe first years of prohibition in this\nstate, there was a very determined ef\xad\nfort made to have the law disregarded\nand brought into disrepute. Officials\nand legislators were alike timid and\nafraid to take a decided stand in f$vor\nof the law. So, for this reaon, the\ncitizens banded themselves together\nto uphold\' the majesty of the law.\nWhat of the future? If we are to\n{succeed we need not alone a body of\ncitizens to maintain the law, but we\nneed state enforcement. Our legis\xad\nlature has recognized this to a certain\nextent by providing a law giving re\xad\nwards Cor the conviction of blind\n•plggers but this is not sufficient We\ndo not want to do away with any .of\nthe prorvteions for enforcement al\xad\nready given as but we want to add\nthpTeto. We isibould have a temper\nanoe commission or & \'board of com\nml«aiohers, whose sole duty it skoqld\nbe to see that this law, Is Enforced\nThis commission or board of commie\nskraera should have power to enable\nthem to dto Che work thoroughly. And\nwe expect to have this matter thor\xad\noughly discussed later in our meet\xad\ning. At a conference of temperance\n.workers held at Devils Lake last sum\xad\nmer a committee was selected to draft\na temperance commissioner bill and\nthe report of it would be well for us\nto urge our representatives to secure\nthe passage of this bill at the earliest\ndate possible.\nof this organization recognizes the: to total abstinence. All the moral\npreyail. We are glad, therefore for\'try\'s greatest general, U. S. Grant in\nhis famous message, "I propose to\nfight it out on this line if it takes all\nsummer." We must show the same\nkind of enthusiasm manifested by our\nhonored president, Theodore Roose\xad\nvelt, as "he ltd his brave soldiers up\nour con-\nthe opportunity of holding\nvention in this city.\nAn annual convention seems a fit\xad\nting time to take a look backward, a\nlook around, and a look forward. It\nwill be my purpose to lead your\nthoughts in these directions while I\nspeak of the interests of our cause.\nthe state and that the\nstate generally would suffer great\nfinancial loss. But the record of the\nyears has told a different story.\nI would call your attention to the\nwonderful progress that our state has\nmade. Our population has more than\ndoubled in 1904 not including the\nIndians, it had reached 437,070. Our\npeople own and operate 52,801 farms.\nThere are 4,257 miles of railroad. We\nhave 821 postoffices and 184 rural free\ndelivery routes. Harve 82 creameries\nand they are in operation and the\nvalue of creamery products is $4,100,\n000. 1905 statistics show 99 lignite\ncoal mines in operation with a pro\xad\nduction of 239,296 tons of coal. 265\nnewspapers are now published in the\nstate. In 1904, according to the\nbureau of statistics of the United\nStates agricultural department, the\nvalue of crops produced on our farms\nwith the value of live stock remaining\non the farms amounted to $128,896,011.\n1904 reports show 3,802 public schools\nwith 5,358 teachers. We expended\nthat year for the support of public\nschools, $2,682,107 and our schools\nhave an endowment valued at $50,000,\n000. The entire assessed valuation of\nall the property in the state was in\n1890, $70,000,000 in 1904 it was $173,\n544,077 while the total valuation of\nthe state is over one billion dollars.\nI am glad to note that the press^in\nour state with very few exceptions,\nearnestly upholds the prohibition law.\nThe different organizations of our\nstate, the W. C. T. U., the Norwegian\nTotal Abstinence association, the\nchurches and Sunday schools, all are\nexerting a strong influence favorable\nforces of our state need to be con\xad\nstantly alert and active upon this\ngreat question. It is a great conflict\nand if we win, and win we must, we\nmust show the faith of Gideon of old\xad\nen times, and we must Show ttrat I\nsame persistance and determination\nwhich was characteristic of our eoun-\nSan Juan hill.\nColombia Tin Deposits.\nSome of the finest tin deposits in\nthe world occur in Colombia. Many\nof the tin mines are worked by for\xad\neign companies.\nImpossible to Get Employment, as\nFace and Body Were Covered With\nItching Sores Scratched Till\nCURED BY CUTICURA\nIN FIVE WEEKS\n"Since the year 1894 I have been\ntroubled with a very bad case of\neczema which I have spent hundreds\nof dollars trying\n\'tacure, and I went\nto the hospital,\nbut they failed to\ncure me and it\nwas getting worse\nall the time.

The sheriff\nsays his city is having the greatest\nmunicipal contest in its history, but\nthat if it were not for the effect of the\nelection upon the state election there\nwould have been no ruction to speak\nof. He predicts Dinnie\'s election for\nmayor by a large majority.\nGood Sign—An evidence of the big\nhouse the K.

By\nan error the announcement was made\nin the Tribune that the seats would be\non sale yesterday, when it should\nhave read\' "today,"\'\' so upon read\xad\ning the paper there was a rush for the\nbox office.\nAnother Chapter—Hannah Rari will\nbe arrested tomorrow on the charge\nof assault and battery, Mrs. Frank\nStaudinger being the .complainant. It\nis said1 by the complainant that while\nin the act of dipping some water from\na slough hole, Mrs. Kari came up with\nMrs. Cumbat and accused\' her of being\nresponsible for the recent arrest of\nKari and Cumbat for stealing icoal\nfrom the Soo, and followed the ac\xad\ncusation with blows and scratching of\nface and hands, all of which goes to\nprove that "Little Russia" is a strenu\xad\nous neighborhood.\nThe Cold Storage Proposition—The\nestablishment here of a first-class\n•creamery and cold storage house will\nin time become a fine investment for\nthe owners and a grand good thing\nfor t!he city. The gentlemen who seek\nto establish such an institution here\nare practical men in the business, and,\nafter looking the field over thoroughly\nare convinced there is a good opening\nhere for such an enterprise. It is\nunderstood! about 500 cows have been\npromised1 as feeders for the creamery,\nwhich would undoubtedly quickly be\nincreased as the benefit® from dairy\xad\ning became appreciated by the farmers\nin this section. The cold storage\nplant in mind will be large enough to\naccommodate many cars of fruit, hun\xad\ndreds of head of dressed beef, butter,\neggs and other perishable produce,\nand the concern would be in the cash\nmarket at all times for the purchase\nof butter and eggs and other farm\nproduce, which would assure a ready\nmarket to the farmers from these\n•sources at all times of the year. A\nsplendid western market awaits ship\xad\nments of all lines of dairy products,\nso the .speculative idea of a cold stor\xad\nage house is eliminated from thei\nproposition. Bismarck will be lucky\nto secure such an institution.\nThe course ip self culture, entitled\n"Correct Social TJsage," Is naving a\nwonderful run, and is being eagerly\ntaken up wherever presented.
