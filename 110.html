Manton Writn Ayaln\nAbout Man.\nTHINKS HE IS TRAIN ROBBER\nHaoConnootod MM WNn Young\nNowlnPon.\nAgain refering to Sheriff\nMoody\'s mysterious slayer will\nsay that I have found without\na doubt -that be was one of the\ntrain robbers who held up the\nN. P. train No. 2 near Valley\nCity in July laat. At LaMoure\na reputable busine man told\nme tnat this man was one of\nthe three men who held up\naaid train. I asked him if this\nwas a fish story, he replied no,\nI have it straight, and when he\nfound that his one pal was con\n•icted and talten to the prison\nat Bismarck and the other pals\nwife had given him away to\nChief McDonald of Bismarck\nwho had arrested him, our des\nperado thought it a put up job\nbetween the other man and his\nwife so the other man could\nturn states evidence against\nhim and his freedom, so resolv*\ned to make a hasty retreat. At\nSanborn I showed one of his\nphotos to a merchant, one of\nhis staff remarked, "that does\nlook like one of the train rob\nbers." I asked how he knew,\nHe replied, we sold them the\ncaps they wore at the holdup\nand which they left on the\nground at the scene of the\nholdup, I purchased one of the\ncaps and showed it to Young,\nthe convicted man. I asked if\nhe had ever seen a cap like\nthat, he replied, yes I had one\nlike that. I asked where it was,\nhe replied I lost it off the N. P.\ntrain near Valley City. I then\nasked him if he could recog\nnize the picture of this man, he\nreplied yes, that is George Ga\nbro, he works for a farmer near\nFordville, on the Soo west of\nConway.\nAt Steele a man recognized\nhim as a man he had frequent\nly met in certain saloon and\npool room at Aberdeen and\ngave me the cover of a check\nbook this man had given him\nwhich would indicate that he\nhad done business with the\nFarmers Saving Bank at Ot\ntoesen, Iowa.,\nAt Bismarck a gentleman\nrecognized him as Thos. Brown\nof Rockford, 111, where he work\ned for a knitting company but\nwould take frequent trips fo^a\nmonth or two and return with\nlots of money. He appears to\nhave been continually jumping\nfrom one section of the country\nto another, changing his name\nat each ~place.\nA former guard at the States\nPrison at Bismarck recognized\nhim as a former inmate of the\nprison during Warden Bouch\nera administration. A clergy\nman at Bismarck also recogniz\ned him as a former inmate of\nthe prison whom he visited at\nthe prison. I am convinced\nthat hia home atate is Iowa. I\nwaa informed at Aberdeen that\nthe train holdup at Vatlej City\nwaa planned at Aberdeen, ao it\nia my opinion that this man\nwaa in hiding at the houae\nwhere he was found and\nthought {Sheriff Moody wanted\nhim for the train holdup is the\nreason he committed the terri\nble deed rather than face a\nlong term in States Prison. I\nwill try and look up this man\'a\n%?\'i .f\n\'$$$*&\n*,m -3\n.t »••. •,v4.\nI\nrecord when I reach Iowa in\ntwo months.\n},l Yours truly\nE. Morden.\nA V\'\nSpoolal Washington Latter.\nWhile30,000 men, women and\nchildren mill workers at Law\nrence, Mass., were out of work\nbecause of a strike to prevent\na cut in their $6, $7 and $8 a\nweek wages, Mrs. Gvelyn Walsh\nMcLean, mother of the baby\nthat is heir to $100,000,000, gave\na $35,000 dinner to 50 guests at\nWashington, the nation\'s capi\ntol.\nThe hostess at this banquet\nwore diamonds that actually\ncost more than half a million\ndollars. In her hair waa die.\nplayed the "famous" Hope dia\nmond, which cost $180,000, and\nat her throat another widely\ncelebrated gem, "Star of the\nEast," which was even larger\nthan the Hope diamond.\nThe coat per plate at the Mc\nLean dinner waa $700. One\nitem in the expense waa 4,000\nyellow lilies imported from\nabvbad at a cost of $2 each.\nOne of the highest paid mill\nworkera at Lawrence would\nhave to work 84 years to re\nceivethe coat of that banquet.\nThe earnings of a dozen Law\nrence workers for half a cen\ntury would not have purchased\nthe gems worn by Mrs. Mc\nLein. A Lawrence worker\nwould have to labor 20 years to\npay for the yellow lilies alone.\nThe strike of the men, wo\nmen and children at Lawrence,\nand the $700 a plate dinner in\nWaahington, is a striking ex\nample of conditions existing\nunder oar system of exceaaive\nprotection in the year of our\nLord 1912. Neither the Law\nrence strike nor the $35,000 Mc\nLean dinner are exceptions.\nThey are but samplea of many\naimilar illustrations which\ncould be cited if apace permit\nted. Only recently, Wm. M.\nWood, the head of the woolen\ntrust, whose employes are now\non strike at Lawrence, was ar\nrested for knocking down and\nrunning over a pedestrian with\nhis automobile. When arraign\ned in court he was asked how\nmany automobiles he owned,\nand he replied he didn\'t kuow.\nImagine a man so rich he\ndoesn\'t know how many autos\nlie has on hand!\nFortunes which make it pos\nsible for one woman to wear a\nhalf a million Hollars\' worth of\ndiamonds at one time, and\nwhich enable a man to possess\nso many automobiles he cannot\nkeep track of them, necessarily\ncome through the power to\nplace a price on the things\nwhich the common people\nmust have in order to live.\nIt is significant, in this con\nnection, that the tariff, the cost\nof living, $700 a plate dinners\n—everythiag but the working\nman\'s wages—have increased\nhand in hand, revealing the in\ntimate\' relationship of one to\nthe other.\nE.

They\nfurnished music for the game\nwith the State U. Tuesday\nevening.\nThe Alpha Literary Society\nheld an interesting meeting\nwith a program last Friday\nnight. Announcements are\nposted of meetings of the other\ntwo societies this week.\nMiss Mirick, Miss Ristow,\nMiss Mason, Mrs. Taylor and\nLoud Pralaaa for Farm Sahool\nParmera who attended the\naeaaiona of the free farming\nachool regularly are loud in\ntheir praises of its value. It is\nbetter understood now, which\nmeana that next year the at\ntendance would be much larg\ner. Aa it is, the leaders were\nwell satisfied. Several farmers\nhave asked that the commer\ncial club take steps to make\nthe school an annual feature\nand the directors cf the county\nfair association are considering\nthe wisdom of holding at the\nsame time a mid-winter poul\ntry show or corn show.\nJ. R. Early sa that the free\nfarming school was strictly all\nright, and that most of the\nfarmers of this vicinity are\nworking blindfolded but don\'t\nknow it. When asked if he\nthought the school was worth\nits cost $100.00 to $125.00, he\nsaid that what they learned\nabout corn alone was worth all\nthat. And Theo.

Snyder of Wahpeton is\nmentioned as a Democratic\ncandidate.\nTariff Is a Tax.\nThe word "Tax" should be\nsubstituted for the word\n"Tariff." The people would\nthen understand the question\nbetter. Fewer people would\nthen accept the protectionist\ntheory that the way for them to\nincrease their prosperity wonld\nbe to increase the tax on every\nthing they eat, wear or use. To\nuse the word "tax" instead of\n"tariff" would be to make the\nprotection appear ridiculous to\nthe wage earner. Instead of\nsaying the "tariff on wool," it\nwould be better to say "the\nwool tax," or "the sugar tax,"\nor "the implement tax," "the\nsewing machine tax," etc. The\nword tariff is a deceiver. But\nthe people know what tax is.\nThey know they pay it them\nselves. The word tariff has\ncertain ring to it that sounds\nlike it was paid by some third\nparty.\nMinneapolis\' most popular\nEuropean Hotel. The Beaufort\n—try it.

The measure\nof my claim on the suffrage of\nthe Democrats at the primary\nin March must be the good of\nthe party. Personal ambition\nhowever laudable, must be a\nsecondary consideration. I ex\npect erpport from my fellow\nDemocrats solely on tbe\nground that I am competent to\nfill the position, not because of\nwealth or lack of wealth. I\nhave been identified with the\nDemocratic party ever since its\norganization in this state. I\niuvite honest criticism and\nhouest comparison on my re\ncord, and shall appreciate your\nvote and influence at the March\nprimary. Should I be so for\ntunate as to be chosen to fill\nthis position, I assure you that\nthe federal patronage of this\nstate shall belong to the Demo\ncrats of the state, and that I\nwill not have any personal can\ndidate for any position.\nFargo, N.

Paul,\n"Of a Truth I Perceive That Qod Is\nNo Respecter of Persons"—\'Various\nBeliefs Dissected.\nIfftSTQg. gUSSEiil\nSingapore. Jan\nuary 28. Pastor\nRussell\'s text for\ntoday was, "Of a\ntruth I perceive\nthat Qod Is no re\nspecter of persons,\nbut In every na\ntion be that fear\neth Him and work\neth righteousness\nis accepted of\nHim." (Acts x, 84.\n35.) A brief re\nport of his excel\xad\nlent address follows:—\nNever before have I seen so cosmo\npolitan a city as Singapore. The\nswarms of Chinese. Malays, Hindoos,\nJavanese. Siamese. Singhalese. Bur\nmese, Afghans. Madrassl, Tamils and\nmany other nationalities nre here in\nterspersed by representatives of prac\ntically every nation in the world.\nThe sight of these commingled peo\nples, only a few of whom know of,\nworship, or in any wise acknowledge\n"the Only True God, and Jesus Christ\nwhom He hnth sent," stln my heart,\nand my head as well.\nWe recognize the clear statements\nof the Apostle that "Without faith It\nis Impossible to please God (Hebrews\nxi, 6): and "How shall tbey believe in\nHim of whom tbey have not beard?"\n(Roman* x, 14) and also the commis\nsion: "This Gospel of the Kingdom\nshall be preached in all the world for\na witness."\nTried and Pound Wanting.\nA considerable class of very good\npeople by tbelr creeds tell us that if\nGod had foreordained the heathen to\nsalvation He would, have seen to It\nthat the Gospel was preached to\nthem and that their not hearing the\nGospel signifies that God "passed them\nby" as "non-elect:" that the "elect" are\nto be found only amongst those who\nhave been favored of God and who ac\ncept that favor and are "sanctified."\nAnother class of people by their\ncreeds, which no longer truly repre\nsent them, tell -as that tbey believe as\nabove, only that tbey add another con\ndition, namely, that "the elect," In or\nder to to of "the elect." must be\nbrought to a knowledge of water bap\ntism—complete immersion—and most\nobey this teaching.\nAnother theory held denies tbat\nthere fiV\'electlon." and denies tbat\nany quantity of water is necessary,\nalthough It does recommend a little.\nThis theory declares God\'s love for the\nheathen, but says that He made faltb\nin Jesus\' sacrificial death a condition\nof salvation and that the responsibility\nfor the heathen\'s not knowing, and\nconsequently their going to eternal\ntorment, rests with Christians them\nselves. They say that God did His\npart in providing the Savior, and that\nthe carrying of this knowledge Is\nwholly dependent upon Christians.\nOne would think that with this view\nfew Christians would be able to sleep\na single night.\nSome dear people, holding the views\nlast mentioned, have started a "Men\nand Religion Forward Movement."\nThey propose to use about two million\ndollars In starting the movement and\nthereby to collect a fund of thirty mil\nlion dollars (six million pounds).\nDear people! How I love them tor\ntheir leal. even though It be as the\nApostle said, "not according to knowl\nedge." (Romans x. 2.) if they could\nstand In Singapore\'s streets and jour\nney with ns a little the eyes of tbelr\nunderstanding would be opened. They\nwould begin to figure out that the sum\nthey expect to spend In converting the\nworld would be little over half a pen\nny per soul! The United States Gov\nernment statistics show that a cen\ntary ago the numbers of heathen wen\nsix hundred millions and that today\nthe number is double.\nA Better Hope Pound.\nSome, repudiating the creeds of the\npast as no longer tenable, fault the\nBible with being the basis for those\ncreeds and abandon It with the creeds.\nLet us. on the contrary, declare th«t\nthe difficulty with the creeds of the\npast has been that they divided up the\nWord of God amongst them, and tbat\neach creed has a certain amount of\ngold as well as a large accumulation\nof dross. It would be too serious an\nundertaking for finite* to put all tbe\ncreeds Into a crucible and separate tbe\ngold from the dross. Let us take the\neasier, the simpler method to which\nall Christian people should be willing\nto accede, namely: to wholly cast aside\nour creeds and go back to the Word\nof God—to the Bible—to the utterances\nof Jesus, the Apostles and Prophets.\nSt. Paul\'s declaration is tbat tbe\nWord of God is sufficient tbat the man\nof God may be fully furnished.

Traveler The\n\'Woodrow Wilson boom nowadays is\nmaking several other presidential det.\ndonations sound like muffled popguns.\nWould Draw From Republicans.\nFresno (Cal.)

Reporter—Govar\n,nor Woodrow Wilson recently said in\n,a public address: "The immediate\n.thing we have got to do is to resume\npopular government." Irrespective ol\nipast party affiliations, or party pros\njpects, this is a pronouncement\nwl!! appeal strongly to a great many\nthinking people. Is it one that the\n\'Republican leaders in Vermont and\n(elsewhere can afford to ignore?\nAnd He Has Something to Say.\nKnoxvllle (Tenn.) Sentinel—An ex\njehsage Is perturbed with fear »t«M\n(Woodrow Wilson may talk too much.\n!Ths veiled meaning of this hint is\n.that It Is wiser for a candidate to\njwhlsper his attitude to the trusts\n\'than to take the. public into .his con\nfidence. However, we can see no ob\njection\' to public discussion so long\nas onf has anything to say.\nTrying to go through the field\nmuseum hss become a sort of mania\nwith McGlnnis. it is at ones a fecr£\nation, a dissipation, a lure and a dis\nappointment.\nYears ago it dawned upon htm that\ngoing through the museum was a duty\nhe owed himself and his city. So,\ncondescendingly one day while out for\na walk he said to himself that he\nmight as well drop In.\nMcGlnnis had also something of the\nfeeling of the amateur when he found\na sign up saying that the museum was\nclosed for repairs. He walked away\nwith his respect for the institution tar\ncreased as one\'s respect always in\ncreases for the unattainable. If he\ncould have walked right In he prob\nably never would have thought any\nthing more about it, but his curiosity\nwas now aroused. Right at hand was\na wonderful collection of instructive\nthings and he was puzzled to know\nwhy people persisted in talking about)\nstocks and ocean trips and the cos(\nof beefsteak and dairy products in\nstead of holding up their hands an{\nexclaiming over the marvels at their\ngates.\nWhen his cousin John came to town\nMcGlnnis clspped him on the shoul\nder. "And now," he ssld, "we\'ll go and\nsss the Field museum!"\nCousin John was glad to go. Both\nof them, however, became so Interest\'\ned in the esses of Pompelsn relics and\nRoman bronze as one goes in that\nit was closing time before they knew\nit\n\'Those bathtubs certainly were\ngreat!" Cousin John said that\n\'To think that those old boys really!\ntook baths the same as we do!"\nMcGlnnis\' brother-in-law was bettsi\neducated, so when some months Ister\nMcGlnnis started out to the museum\nwith him In tow McGlnnis felt he was\ngoing to have a treat. Having seen:\nthe first cases before, McGlnnis took!\ngreat pride in pointing out to his rel\native the old frying pans and vases\nand pitchers Incrusted with lava.\n"Over here," he said, "are a couple\nof bathtubs, too, that they dug up on\na Pompeian estate—"\n"Sorry," said the attendant, hours,\nlater, tapping McGlnnis on the .should\nder, "but it\'s closing time."\nmi\nDifficulties\n4\n\'it does beat all," McGlnnis said as\nthey started reluctantly homeward,\n\'how much time one can waste just at\'\nthe very start! Didn\'t you see some\niStuffed elephants or something farther\'\nback? We\'ll have to try again some\nday!"\nThe brother-in-law, however, had to\nleave unexpectedly and McGlnnis\nstarted out alone. Blpps net him on.\nthe way and ssld he\'d like to go, too\nMcGlnnis laid a straight course In1 thai\ndirection of the huge elephsnts a mils1\nor so farther back, but Blpps oollsred\nhim.\n\'Look at those old Roman things!"\nhe cried enthusiastically. "Faney\ntheir being actually used thousands ol\nyears ago!"\n\'There\'s some elephants back\nthere," McGlnnis protested. "I\'m told\n|the collection of stuffed wild animals\nhas no equal In the world—"\n\'Jlmlny!" chortled Blpps. "Look at\nthe bronze tables and things! And if\nhere aren\'t a couple of bathtubs! Say,\nthose are bigger\'n ours today—a fel\nlow could take a regular swim—"\n"And cases of butterflies from Indlaj\nand Africa and China," pursued thei\nanxious McGinnls. "Like enamels In\n[their color."\n\'They must have had oodles of wa^\nIter In those days." said Bipps. "Say,j\n|how\'d you like a bath—"\n"And Egyptian tiles and inscriptions\nand birds from the moon, I guessj\nland—" si\n\'Those bathtubs certainly, get me//}\njinslsted Blpps dreamily. "Look at the|\neffect of the atmosphere on them! To\nthink that maybe Nero took a bath\'\nIn—"\n"Sorry," said an attendant whll\nthey were still looking at the ba\ntubs, "but it\'s closing time!"\nMM\nat!*}\nMcGlnnis stamped out, followed b:\nBipps still talking about the tubs,\n"There\'s a cuttlefish back then\nsomewhere," McGlnnis growled, a\ncuslngly. "Tweester saw It, so\nknow it\'s there. It has a tali like an\naeroplane propeller and two rudders]\nthat extend back for yards! Yards,\nI\'m telling you! And a relief map ol)\nthe moon that—"\n"They never could have got those\nbathtubs Into one of our dinky mod-j\nern flats," was Blpps\' triumphant com\nment.\nMcGlnnis went absolutely alone the\nnext time.. He resolved to cut his\ndearest friend If he interfered. He\nmade a straight dash from the en\ntrance past the Roman relics that he\ncould see nights in his sleep and tore\nmadly for the treasures beyond.\nJust ss he sighted the African war\nelephsnts and caught a gUmpse of a\nwhole mensgerle of chimpanzees and\ngorillas and snakes sad mask oxen\nand about a hundred doors leading\nInto other entertainments Sadie Uv\nman grabbed his arm.\n"Oh, lir. McGlnnis!" she ssld. "I\'m\nSO«H glad met you! rve cot to\nwrite a paper for our club en Pompel\nsn days and I\'m so-o-o stupid!
