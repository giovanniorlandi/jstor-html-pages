emanates from a reliable\nsource In Houston It Is bellere d that\nthe Missouri Kansas and Texas rail\nway is preparing to build a line from\nPalestine to Dallas via Athens\nSurveyors are now at work but\nSphinxlike silence prevails and no\ninformation whatever can bo ob\ntained from this source\nJust looking about over the coun\ntry Is the nonchalant reply that is\nmade to all inquiries concerning the\nmission of the surveyors\nIt is confidently expected however\nthat within a very short while pub\nlic announcement will be made to the\neffect that the project Is a new rail\nroad\nThe surveyors arc now at Athens\nregistered at the Decn hotel H L\nErlsman is the leader of the party\nand the work of surveying Is being\npushed rapidly\nI have no doubt said a promi\nnent Houston man who Is closely\nidentified with Texas railroads that\nthis new road is a Missouri Kansas\nand Texas enterprise For some\nreason however the executive au\nthorities of that road dp not seem to\nwant their connection with it made\npublic just yet\nOf course that is their business\nand according to my way of thinking\nit doesnt make much difference who\nbuilds the road just so it is built\nMy idea is that we need all the rail\nroads we can get in Texas and I am\nglad to see this enterprise under way\neven though it does not directly ben\nefit Houston further than the fact\nthat Houston is a composite body and\nthere is a common interest throughout\nthe state even though it is a country\nof magnificent distances\nIt seems that the proposed new\nroad is fixing up in advance for Its\nfreight tonnage inasmuch as the same\nparties that are according to my be\nlief building the road have just un\ndertaken a vast orchard enterprise\nnear Palestine They have purchased\n800 acres of land and have planted the\nentire tract In peach trees They are\nalso negotiating for 3000 acres more\nand the chances are that the deal will\nbe consummated It is said that the\npurpose of the investors is to make\nthe greatest orchard in Texas With\nin a few years the fruit shipments\nfrom tbJsorchardsrlll makejju\nor the railroads ami a significant\nfact Is that the proposed orchard land\nis situated exactly on the survey of\nthe new road and is six miles from\nany road that Is now in operation\nThus it is at once apparent that there\nis a strong connecting link between\nthe newly surveyed road and the big\norchard\nOf course there will be other\nthings besides fruit to haul but the\nproduct of such a great orchard will\nnecessarily cut quite a figure in\nfreight traffic\nIt is believed that Palestine will\nbe the general headquarters of the\nline which while distinctly a Mis\nsouri Kansas and Texas enterprise\nwill be operated by a separate sys\ntem of officials Tills will mean a\nboost for the progressive little city of\nPalestine which is already one of the\nbest towns In Texas Houston Post\nRailway Officials Meet\nSpecial to the Herald\nChicago
