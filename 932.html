        <pre>['468 Journal of Dental Education ■ Volume 66, No. 4\nLetter to the Editor\nDear Dr. Alvares:\nThough the recession may be over, concerns\nabout the volatility of the economy remain. After all,\nlook where we’ve just come. In November 2001, the\ngroup of economists that tracks business cycles made\nthe announcement that “the longest economic expansions\non record gave way earlier this year to the first\nrecession in a decade and the 10th since World War II.”\nAs the government, stock markets, businesses, and\nuntold numbers of families still struggle to overcome\nthe consequences of the latest recession (including the\nloss of general medical and dental insurance coverage),\ndental students may well be concerned about their\npersonal economic prospects as they are about to enter\npractice. A historical review of the spending for\ndental services during periods of favorable and notso-favorable\neconomics, however, should reassure stu-\ndents (and even prospective students) that dental practice\ncontinues to have a favorable outlook.\nSince the end of World War II, spending for dental\nservices increased from less than a billion dollars\nto $56 billion. Aside from inflationary factors, expansion\nin spending reflects an increase in the general\npopulation, advances in technology, the increased costs\nassociated with the delivery of services, and—despite\nmarked decreases in decay rates—an increasing use\nof preventive and reparative services.\nDuring the same period, there was 1) a more than\ndoubling of the number of professionally active dentists,\nfrom 79,200 in 1950 to 164,700 in 1999, and 2)\nan increase in the population from 152 million to 278\nmillion. Overall, there was an increase from fifty-two\nprofessionally active dentists per 100,000 persons in\n1950 to sixty active dentists per 100,000 persons in\nthe early 1990s.\nThe boost in the number of dentists was the result\nof increases in the number of dental students en-\ntering first-year classes (reaching a maximum of 6,301\nin 1978). This in turn was followed by a one-third decrease\nin class sizes. Since the mid-1990s, as a result\nof the roller-coaster changes in dental school enrollment\nand an increasing resident population, there has\nbeen a decrease in the professionally active dentistto-population\nratio. This decrease is projected to con-\ntinue through the year 2020, with the number of active\ndentists per population declining to the levels of\nthe late 1970s.\nSpending Per Dentist. In each year of the second\nhalf of the twentieth century (including those in\nwhich recessions occurred), there was an increase in\ncurrent dollar expenditures per active dentist. Between\n1950 and the mid-1980s, there was a progressive increase\nin constant dollar spending per active dentist.\nThe increase in constant dollar spending continued during\neach of the recessions through the early 1980s.\nHowever, constant dollar spending per active\ndentist decreased during the 1990-91 recession—a\ntime when the active dentist-to-population ratio was\nreaching its peak. But, since 1992, a period of decreasing\nactive dentist-to-population ratios, constant dollar\nsending per active dentist once again increased.\nPer Capita Spending. Since the mid-1930s (including\nthe periods of economic recession), there has\nbeen a continuing increase in current and constant dollar\nper capita expenditures (a combination of out-of-\npocket and increasing third-party spending for dental\nservices).\nSo what does it all mean for dental students?\nYes, the country has just passed through yet another\nrecession. Yes, some areas were hard-hit, and the numbers\nof dental practitioners could experience some de-\ncreases in practice activity. But if sixty-five years of\npast experiences, including ten recessions since World\nWar II, are any indicator of future developments, the\neconomics of dental practice will weather the most\nrecent downturn and continue to be favorable. Supporting\nthis favorable outlook is:\n• The continuing decline in dentist-to-population ratios;\n• The demand for services by the aging baby-boomer\npopulation; and\n• The need for services by numerous underserved\npopulations, including the poor, minority group\nmembers, and individuals with developmental and\nother disabilities.\nIn short, shouldn’t we be telling our students (and\ncandidates for admission) the good news?\nH.
