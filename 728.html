Coffey, head of Maynooth Col, lege, the geatest Catholic ecclesiasti, cal college outside Rome. Dr. Coffey, is also president of the Catholic Total, Abstinence Federation. In an inter, view he said:, “Only the willfully blind cannot or, will not see that in the past exces, sive drinking has gravely demoralized, the Irish nation. It has grown be, yond the power of temperance re, formers to cope with. The nation must, deal with it or go down in dishonor, and disgrace,, “An unregulated saloon traffic, with, a drink shop for every fifty families;, a widespread unlicensed saloon traf, fic, with countless shebeens, methylat, ed spirits hawked through the poor, districts of our cities, our young peo, ple lured into drinking habits by the, thousands; thirty million pounds ster, ling spent on drink and how many, millions levied for the upkeep of the, victims—is that a problem for the, church and state in Ireland to leave j, in the hands of the few who are called, temperance faddists because they, show' some concern at the disgrace of, their country and their rel igi on ?, “I w'ould earnestly plead that not, total abstainers alone but all right, minded Irishmen should ask them, selves what they are going to do, about it., Religion Futile, “Do they think the evil will ever lie, remedied by the moral appeal in the, name of religion? If so they are mis, taken. Moonshine making is, in some, parts of the country, a reserved sin,, and tiiis ecclesiastical measure is wide, ly ignored. I have been assured that, tin' most effective way of stoppingi, that particular abuse is by stopping, the free importation and sale of thej, raw material, which is treacle. This!, may or may not 1-e feasible, but any, how it implies Government action. The, moral appeal is useless while the, traders who set it at defiance are, free to lure people to drink., “The saloon keepers here always, approved of the ‘moral suasion’ type, of temperance reform, knowing how, innocuous it is to the liquor interests., But it is very sensitive to any self, protective movement of the citizens, for the enactment and enforcement of i, the liquor traffic legislation. The man, ner in which the liquor traffic was, conducted in the past in the absence, of coercive control has made more, converts to total prohibition than any, amount of ‘Pussyfoot’ propaganda., Charges Bribery, “The saloon keepers in the past, made friends of the members of the, Royal Irish Constabulary by bribery,, with tlie result that they were able, to sell broadcast at any time of the, day or night. Now Ireland has its, own police force—the Civic Guards—, and should the saloon keepers succeed, in ‘making friends’ of its members it, will give the country another argu, merit for total prohibition., “In face of the fact that, apart from, shebeens and clubs and ‘off-licenses.’, Ireland has a drinkshop for every 250, inhabitants, while England has only, 1 to -100 and Scotland 1 to 700, it is, unthinkable that the Irish liquor traf, fice should be allowed to go an as it, is. True, the morale of the country, has been reduced by the recent out, rageous happenings, and so one can, not be too sure of its willingness to, react against its present drink demor, alization. But, supposing it does,, there are only two alternatives con, fronting the liquor traffic. It will, have to he either mended or ended., I know there are many who, believing, sincerely that it cannot be mended,, would advocate ending it., Urges Free State, “But I think that, while the saloon, keepers themselves would cevtainly, choose the alternative of mending,, the majority of the Irish people also, would like to give the Free State Gov, ernment of their own selection a, chance of mending it., “The need of drastic reform is ur, gent, and a government cannot very, well tackle such a grave national prob, lem without a fairly clear mandate, | from the people. We shall have a, general election some time this year—, an adult suffrage. From the Legisla, ture then elected the country will ex, pect a constructive policy and pro, gram. Will the people tell their future, legislators in advance that they con, sider legislative reform of the liquor, traffic an essential condition of all, national reconstruction? They ought, to do it, for it is. But I cannot answer, for them. The people, as citizens,, must demand temperance legislation, from parliamentary candidates or, they will pot get it., Political Issue, “This is not a matter merely for, temperance organizations or for po, litical parties. It is for the Irish peo, ple, through their reprsentative local, boards and public bodies, to demand, reform of the liquor traffic if they, desire it. If everybody waits for, somebody else to press this demand, before the next general election, nothing will be done—except by the, liquor interests. I would appeal to, the multitude of Irishmen and women, who have at heart in this matter no, particular interests, but only the wel, fare and prosperity of Ireland—moral, and material—to realize that from, now on they should lose no opportun, ity of giving public expression to Ire- j, land’s need for drastic restriction of, a traffic which has so cruelly aggra, vated our heartbreaking troubles in, the crises through which our afflict, ed country has been passing.”, WOULD FEDERATE, ALL U. S. VETERANS, NEW YORK, Feb. 2.—Steps for the, federation of all veterans of the wars, of the United States, whether or not, t hoy are now affiliated with any or, ganization, to protect their interest,, especially when they are in public ser, vice, will be launched in this city, within the current month., Tiie proposed organization is being, supported by commander William A., Dawkins, himself a veteran, and a, number of associates who are connect, ed with various veterans’ organiza, tions. Tiie society probably will be, called the “Federation of Veterans,”, and will he open to men of all ranks, from all branches of the Government, service., It is intended to pattern very close, ly the present make-up of the Ameri, can Federation of Labor, and permit, the veteran units to remain as at pres, ent within the ranks of their own vet, eran organizations with additional, membership in the general federation., The purpose of the federation will, bp to work for legislative enactments, of benefit to tiie service men of ail, wars and to exercise a salutary effect, upon the body politic in instances of, discrimination against veterans in the, public service., R.

James Robin, son, a passenger conductor, when lie, left the service of the Pennsylvania, Railroad, carried with him the same, lantern with which he made liis first, run ,38 years ago., In all that time Robinson had suc, cessfully guarded the lantern against, mishaps which are part of the average, railroad man’s life.

Among these are: The open, ing of the Moose Creek coal fields; the oper, ation of the Evan Jones coal mine; the en, trance of additional capital into \\\\ illow Creek,, including the recent purchase of a bond mi, the Mable group by the Kennecott Copper, evaporation, and the Fern Cold Mining Com, pany, Avliich starts its mill in the spring; the, deep-leval tunnels being run by the Cold, Bullion Company and the Kelly Mines Com, pany, the inauguration of doA’elopment by the, Home-Builders Company and a number of, other promising prospects., Added to this roseate outlook for doATelop, mont in this immediate district is the an, nouncement of the acquisition of big copper, holdings in the Kantisha district by the Cue, genheims. This latter deal carries with it, immense possibilities, in that it presages the, forthcoming of a smelter or reduction Avorks, somewhere along the Alaska Railroad. While, this is speeulatWe. it assumes an element of, AToritv in its necessity for the development of, base ore deposits., With this additional capital coming into, the railroad belt comes the promise that all, labor will be employed and that Avith each, step of development will come a greater, demand for commerce and labor, creating a, revolving situation altogether acceptable., Colonel Means announces fear of the rail, road being SAvamped Avith tourist traffic,, which again adds to the optimistic outlook for, a prosperous season., Cropping area around Anchorage Avill be, double that of last season, and Avith this, gnoAvth of home production larger A’olumes, of capital ayi 11 be kept at home. Taken all, in all. the outlook is ATery roseate.—Anchorage, Times., “FIGURES CAN\'T LIE?”, The old adage about the converse to the non, Jvim* nature of figures gets often exemplified, these days. All sorts of apostles of economic, as well as political unheaval have developed, an almost passionate fondness for statistics—, of a sort. They start with premises of theory, that are far from orthodox; these thev but, tress with “statistics” even queerer still. It, seems so profound and authoritative. Labor, union “experts” set the fashion; now the new, brand of western statesmen follow it. Much, of their gospel is economic; a statistical ac, companiment sets off the tune., But they will persist in straying from the, key of accuracy. They intone startling state, ments of what they assert to be alarming, fact. No matter at all if readily available, data quite contradict the inference. Tt is so, easy either to ignore criticism or to shift, ground a little . But can such distortion of, fact permanently avail if the critics will but, keep pounding away at exposure?, Two or three such exposures, all in the, western part of the country where free-handed, figuring seems in fashion, have occurred in, the past few days. They pertain to the custo, mary topics of banking and railroading., The refutations are addressed to three Sen, ators who have been very voluble on such, topics,—Brookheart, Shipstead and Capper., Brookheart,—who currently announces in, tent to “get after” stock dividends on the, ground that they are “melons,”—has been, talking much about Wall Street domination, of the Federal reserve system and about de, prival of credit to the Northwest. But bank, ers from his own state pertinently point out, that iho share of reserve system credit, ac, cording to assets, that would be apportionable, 1 o 454 member banks in Iowa was $57,500,000;, as a matter of fact, they got $90,000,000. Brook", heaTt probably never bothered to read about, the shifting of Federal reserve rediscounts, within the system., Shipstead said freight rates more ihan ab, sorbed all the value of sheep sent to market., But President Felton of Chicago Great West, ern proves by the cold figures that rates, amount to onlv from two and one-half per, cent to ten and one-half per cent of the mar, ket value. Shipstead said the trainload is ten, times what is was 20 years ago, despite “a, great labor cost reduction per ton.” Felton, points out the trainload increase is twice, not, toil times, as much; and that labor cost per, ton has not fallen but has risen—from 4.15, to 9.02 mills per mile, and so on., Senator Capper, depending on an “expert”, witness before the Commerce Commission, re, peated the assertion that extra maintenance, above previous year spent by Atchison was, about $11,000,000. President Storey points, out that after necessary readjustments under, Commerce Commission bookkeeping require, ment and allowance for strike expense the, real figure was $1,500,000—which itself was, needed to get facilities in shape to handle, greatly increased business., What President Storey says the Senator, should do applies to many of these imaginative, • statisticians—“rely on more accurate statistics, if he expects his arguments to have weight.”, EUROPEAN LOGIC, As curious specimens of logic, some of the, arguments advanced for the purpose of in, voiving the United States in purely European, affairs ought to have a place in a comic, (treatise on metaphysics. The French spokes, men argue — You American saved us from, destruction by Germany; now it is your duty, to guard us for all future time. On the same, line of reasoning, if one man saves another, from drowning, it becomes his duty to serve, as a protector and supporter of the unfortu, nate all the rest of his life. Recently the, internationalists have tried to induce the, United States to say just how much repara, lions Germany should pay. If they succeeded, in this, their step in propaganda would be the, advancement of the theory that since the, United States set the amount of the repara, tions. it is the duty of the United States to, see that it is paid., British newspapers have recently explained, the rapid increase in the value of the British, pound sterling by saying that Britain’s “in, visible exports” more than counterbalance her, imports of commodities, and her merchant, marine income is cited as one important item, in this invisible source of national income., Undoubtedly the explanation is sound. The, United States is contributing verv largely to, that portion of British income by failing U, maintain an adequate merchant marine under, the American flag., A prominent college professor wants “a, suspension of all tariffs the world over for, five years.” He has the unanimous approval, of the cheap labor of Europe and Asia which, would like to market its products in the, 1 nited States whether the American workman, has a job or not. Why doesn’t the professor, [get out and run for Congress upon a program, of throwing down the bars for the admission, ot the products of cheap labor from everv, whore in the world? He would find that the, same voters who believe in keeping out cheap, labor also believe in restricting the importa, tion of products of cheap labor., In the midst of talk of forcing railroads to, merge into systems in order to promote econ, omy and efficiency of operation, two import, ant mergers are under way through the in, itiative of owners of the roads. This is the, proper method. It is not at all likely that, any Government tribunal, ignorant of the, practical problems of railroading, could make, an arbitrary merger that would be as satis, factory and successful as a merger worked, out by railroad owners and managers who, best understand the natural channels of trade, and can work out the best schemes for the, handling of freight with the least loss of time, and the smallest cost of operation., OFFICE CAT, TRADE MARK, BY JUNIUS, COPYRIGHT 1921, BY EDGAR ALLAN MOBS*, WINTER, The shoulders of the hills are bent, By heavy packs of drifted snow;, The glaciers that the frost has sent,, Have silvered mirror lakes aglow., It is the time for winter sports,, For skates and sleds and slender, skis,, For brave assaults on frozen ports, And for the bathroom pipes to, freeze., “If Will Hays is sincere in his ex, pressed intention to improve the, movies,” declares a Cordovan, “lie, will issue a decree forbidding fat, people from occupying the end seats.”, Now they are sending handwriting, by telegraph.

Feb. 2. — Great Britain, has begun exporting her surplus wo, men., Although the exportation is not tak, ing place under official direction and, is by no means compulsory, the move, ment is being carried on with the, tacit approval of the authorities. It, is being directed by a new organiza, tion known as the “Home Compan, ions.”, The object of the movement is to, provide wives for men in those sec, tions of the British Empire where, there is a surplus of male population., It is described by those who are di, recting the emigration as a scheme to, “adjust, the balance of sexes in the, Empire.”, Many Extra Girls, There are 2,000.000 surplus women, in England, it is estimated. It is also, estimated that in Australia alone, not, to mention other British dominions,, there are 200,000 surplus men, and the, number is steadily growing because, of continued emigration of males to, the colonies., The first “consignment” of girls to, Australia will be fifty in number and, will sail this month. Each woman, must be more than twenty years old., but not more than thirty. Each one, also will be required to possess about, $500 of her own, half of it to pay her, passage to Australia and the other, half to guarantee her ability to return, if she does not like it., “We want girls who are prepared to, rough it—not flighty, irresponsible, girls who are out for a good time ”, said Miss Ettie Rout, secretary of the, Home Companions, who is directing, the movement. “Patriotic, serious, minded girls who are willing to go out, to the corners of the Empire for the, sake of the Empire—that is the type, we want., Not Easy Job, “It will not be a bed of roses for, them—they may have to work hard., But they will have an opportunity to, make careers for themselves, and it, is more than likely that the majority, of them will marry., “Women will be sent out in groups, of twenty, under the care of a respons, ible officer of the society, who will, acquaint them during the voyage with, household management and Australian, customs. Every girl that goes out will, be guaranteed a post as soon as she, arrives. To accustom them to colon, ial life employment will be found for, them as companions and ‘helps’ in typ, ical Australian country homes.”, The Home Companions are being, aided In the work by the Society for, Overseas Settlement of British Wom, en and by the Feminist Club of Syd, ney., MONTANA’S “DRY”, FORCES ACCUSED, HELENA ,Mont„ Feb. 2.—The State, prohibition enforcement force of Mon, tana is under fire, and an investiga, tion by a legislative committee is, probable, following charges made by, Representative Lester H. Loble in the, lower house of the General Assembly., The enforcement officers of the, state are under the direction of At, torney General W. D. Rankin, brother, of Jeanette Rankin, first woman mem, ber of the United States Congress., In a resolution presented in the, flouse and referred to the Committee, on Morals, Representative Loble, charged that one of the enforcement, officers has been convicted in a Fed, eral court on a bribery charge; that, another is an ex-convict and that a, third has been convicted in Montana, of violating the liquor laws., Lobly made reference to a recently, published story reciting the seizure of, a state prohibition officer’s automo, bile at Billings by Federal agents on, the charge that the machine had been, used in illegal transportation of li, quor., The Montana law provides that pro, hibition enforcement officers may re, ceive their pay from a fund made up, of fines collected from those convict, ed of violating the liquor law3. and, Loble contended that, because officers, have a pecuniary interest in the out, come of all trials on liquor law viola, tion charges, a situation has been cre, ated that may result in many abuses., A bitter fight against the investiga, tion of the State prohibition force by, the Montana Anti-Saloon League is, predicted, and already the campaign, has been started by that organiza, tion\'s president, the Rev.

Much de, pends upon whether you are on the, big or little end of said swing., Complex System, A “big” dollar is equal to approxi, mately 150 coppers, or eleven dimes,, and five coppers. But a dime is not, equivalent to ten pennies—nothing so, simple. A dime may be changed for, twelve, thirteen or fourteen coppers,, according to the exchange., A “little” dollar is equal to ten, dimes. The difference between a, “big” dollar and a “little” dollar is, approximately one dime and a flock, of coppers. |, The tourist begins to show signs oi |, a brainstorm when he spies a grin, ning Buddha in a shop which he, knows the minute he sees it he must, buy for Minnie, who instructed him, to bring her “one of them heathen, idols” from China., “This is a very interesting Chinese, curio, and I want to purchase it, going to take it to America. What is, the price on the tag?” he asks the in, different Chinese salesman., The Chinese looks blank. He knows, that the American is a stranger. He, is too polite in his English to be an, old China hand., After much talking the Chinese, sees light., “Oh, me savey—you wanche liny?, You talkee me how muchee? I talkee, you plopped price ten dollar fifty., T’lenty cheap.”, The tourist, who does not realize, the cheap porcelain or brass god is, worth about three dollars, gives the, suave grafter ten dollars and five, dimes., Want “Big” Money, Oh, no, no, no, no, master!” explodes, the shopkeeper. “I talkee you big, money. Wanche you pay me five dolla, six dimes and five coppa. This be, long plopper.”, In department stores signs are, often seen: “Small money accepted, up to fifty cents—above, big money.”, If you wish to buy a magazine marked, thirty cents you pay three dimes, but, if marked ninety cents it costs you ten, dimes and several coppers., In order to avoid this constant, struggle between big and little money, the chit system is used., If you buy a house and lot you, sign n chit. If you take a big party, to the local jazz palace for dinner you, sign a chit. Tf you order a new gown, from a French shop, or hire a taxi, or, buy an ice cream soda, instead of pay, ing cash you sign your name to an, I. O. TT., The system is wonderful so far as, the signing goes. But many a young, man finds he has let the chit system, go to his head when it comes to pay, ing his bills. Every month the Chinese, shroffs make the rounds of the of, fices and business houses to collect., How those carelessly signed chits do, add up! Ofter it is difficult for a, man to leave Shanghai without set, tling his accounts, for the faithful lit, tle shroff will be down at the dock to, see him off—presenting his bill and j, making a scene before the man’s, friends., The chits\'are nearly always paid, by check. This means “big” money—, far be it from the banks to deal in, “little” money—but it saves the end, less fighting over a few coppers that, always takes place when paying cash., PREACHER FACES CHARGE, OF ILLICIT RUM RUNNING, ACROSS CANADIAN LINE, POUT HURON, Mich. Feb. 2.—Rev., Roland Crouch, Free Methodist pas, tor, is held here as head of a gang, of rum smugglers., Using his clerical garb to cloak, his real activities, Federal officers, charge, he has crossed the river to, and from Sarnia, Ontario, repeatedly,, carrying loads of moonshine in his, automobile. Because of his calling, immigration officials failed to sus, pect and challenge him., Until two years ago, Couch said,, he was pastor of the Elmwood Meth, odist Church here. He said he had, dropped the ministry of late, but, admitted having held several relig, ious meetings in the Thumb District,, acting as a “spare” pastor., Try Daily Times lor Job Printing., ENGLISH BEER, DRINK CUT, BY HIGH PRICE, LONDON, Feb. 2.—High taxes, low, wages and unemployment are making, Great Britain temperate., Statistics issued by the Brewers’, Society show that in the last four, years consumption of beer in England, has decreased 60 per cent. This has, not resulted from any growth of tee, totalist sentiment among King, George’s subjects, but is due entirely, to the fact that the average Briton, cannot afford to drink as much beer, as he formerly consumed., Ln 1918 England poured 36,000,000, barrels of beer down its thirsty gul, lets. In 1920 the consumption had, decreased by 10,000,00 barrels to 26,, 000,000. and in 1921 a further drop of, 3.000. 000 barrels is recorded, with a, total consumption for that year of, 23.000. 000 barrels. The year just, closed, however, almost gave the brew, ers heart failure, for the sturdy Eng, lishmen—and women—curtailed their, consumption of the brew to 18,000,000, barrels., Taxes Multiplied, Perhaps the main answer to the, question is found in the fact that- com, pared with pre-war taxation, the duty, on beer is thrirteen times as great as, it was before the Germans started the, big scrap. The brewers, generous, hearted souls though they may he. do, not feel that they should pay this thir, teen-fold increase in taxes out of, their own pockets. They have added, a few shillings to the cost of each bar, rel of beer to the consumer, and the, thirsty Cockney finds liimselm unable, to quench his thirst with the fre, quency or the volume that was his, wont., The fact that more than 1 000,000, persons are out of work in England, has been an undoubted contributing, factor to the decline in beer consump, tion. The added fact that wages paid, workmen have not increased as rapid, ly as the cost of necessities of life is, another element mitigating against, the prosperity of the brewers., Beer Still High, Cheaper materials, except hops,, have not decreased the manufacturing, cost sufficiently to warrant the brew, ers reducing the price of their product., A more or less anomalous situation, has arisen out of the beer dilemma., The object of the Government in im, posing heavy taxes on intoxicants was, to increase the revenue of the realm., It has worked just the other way., In 1920 the Government’s revenue, from the beer tax was 123,000,000, pounds. The estimated revenue for, 1922 is 90,000,000 pounds, or a drop, of 33,000,000 pounds in two years. And, the brewers say that the Chancellor of, the Exchequer may not get his 90,000,, 00 pounds for 1922. as that is an es, timated figure only., The brewers declare that Britons, will not get hack to a pre-war beer, basis until the Government reduces, the duties on beer. “Prohibition by, dearness,” they declare, is an imposi, tion upon the people that must he, rectified by legislation., Accordingly there is now in prog, ress a vigorous campaign for the re, duction of the beer tax, and it is re, ported the movement has found favor, with an increasing number of mem, bers of Parliament. It is not unlikely, that before statistics for 1923 become, available the tariff on the amber, brew will have been reduced, and, Britons once more will be hitting their, pre-war stride in the consumption of, beer., HAWAHMAYHAVE, | TERRITORIAL BANK, HONOLULU, Feb. 2. — A proposal, for the establishment of a territorial, savings bank was broached by mem, bers of the Territorial Cabinet at a, meeting with Governor Wallace R., Farrington. The plan is based on one, followed during the days of the mon, archy in Hawaii and would be similar, to that on which the postal savings, banks now operate. Interest at 4 per, cent would be paid on savings de, posits and the funds invested in se, curities, which would give a sufficient, margin to pay expenses and make a, fair profit for the Territory., It was pointed out that the Terri, torial Government now has big de, posits with the local banks on which, interest of only 2 per cent is paid,, and it was though that a part of these, sums could be used in establishing the, territorial bank. It is probable that, the matter will be considered by the, next Legislature, which meets next, spring., -•, Send the Dally Times to your, friends outside., VERSAILLES FAST, GOING TO PIECES, PARIS, Feb. 2. — Versailles, the, palace, with its surrounding gardens, and statues, is doomed to ruin if, quick steps toward reparations are, not taken., The gradual decay of the famous, Apollo group, the chariot drawn by, four superb horses, is beginning to, cause alarm among art circles. “The, work of destruction is not on the sur, face,” says the Minister of the Beaux, Arts, “and therefore all the more, dangerous. The legs of the horses are, gradually contracting and the necks, staving into the bodies. Ono or two, more summers of playing the foun, tains and the beautiful group of, Tuby will c-mse to be—that i3 the, tragedy which is going on at Ver, snilles.”, The cost of repairing this gr,up, alone will he at least $20,000, and, there are many others in need— (he, remarkable group of “Spain Sub, dued,” by Cirardon, and “Abundance,”, by Coysevox, in the court, where the, balustrades and foundations are in, a bad state. The trellis work en, closing the gardens must be com, pletely restored, at a cost of $25,000,, and a service of fire prevention, should he installed in the Trianon., The repair work in the garden alone, needs immediate attention, not to, speak of what should be done in the, palace itself. If reparation measures, are not soon taken Americans who, pass this way will miss seeing per, haps France’s greatest monument—, a svmbol of the spirit which domin, ated the kingdom in the good old, days of the monarchy., WIFE CRACK SHOT WITH, FLAT IRON, BUT HUSBAND, MUST PAY HER ALIMONY, BROCKTON, Mass., Feb. 2.—Joseph !, H.

From information at, hand it was thought that the plans, called for too elaborate a structure, for th\'e funds available and in case, the contract is not awarded on May 10, a committee, consisting of Caleb Cor, ser, Chas. J. Goodall and A. J. Adams, was appointed to examine the pres, ent plans and be prepared to report, changes that could be made in them, so as to meet this emergency., Secretary Edward F. Medley sub, jmitted his report for 1922, in which, ! he reviewed the work done by the, Chamber during the past year. There, iare at present 26 members, with over, $300 in the treasury. The following, excerpts are taken from his report:, “The constructive work of the Cham, ber for the past year has been fair, ! ly well rewarded. The public build, ing has been advertised, and a new, advertisment secured under which bids, ! must be in the office of the Super, | vising Architect on or before May, \' loth. It is understood that the speci, I fications have been modified since the, original advertising., “Among other matters which the, Chamber has supported are the pro, position to include Alaska in the Fed, eral Highway Act (Delegate Suther, land has introduced a bill to effectuate, this end); the construction of the road, between Mile 30 and Katalla, which, due to the efforts of the Chamber has, secured more favorable consideration, from the Forestry Department than, ever before, with a fair likelihood of, being built if the Territory is included, in the general road bill; the endorse-j, ment of the fisheries reservation, plans of the Bureau of Fisheries and, the approval of the substitute for the, White Bill, which would place all, Alaska fisheries in the control of the, Secretary of Commerce; the demand, for an Assistant District Attorney in, Cordova, which appears to have been, favorably acted upon; the continua, tion of the road work around Eyak, Lake which will be completed to the, Fish Hatchery the coming year; mail, service for the fox islands in Prince, William Sound; and installation of a, radio broadcasting plant at Mile 7., “The Chamber has vigorously sup, ported the efforts of the Alaska Road, Commission in maintaining and im, proving the Valdez-Fairbanks Road,, and also in promoting the work of, bridging the Nizina River., "In all these various activities, |, your Secretary invariably found help, ful co-operation and courteous recep, j tion from the various Government of- ■, ficials and bureaus involved., “The only failure which the Cham, ber has to report from its work is the, lamentable response from other Alas, ka commercial bodies to the proposi, tion fathered by the Cordova Cham, ber to have an All-Alaska Chamber, of Commerce. The fact that most of, the various commercial bodies failed, to even acknowledge communications, on the subject is a severe commentary, on the civic spirit in the towns them, selves., "The members of the Chamber in, good standing are the following:, Messrs.
