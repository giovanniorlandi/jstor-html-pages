I had caused a tension, bfettreen governments.”, Amo^g the documents this-genial, lilts of "secret personnel** of -the, dape supplied practically gratis were, “mliiurlly organised security police,", which contained the names -and resi, dences of no I Ms than <4,000 per, sons. The nave* had been taken, from the telephone director^* He, also offered and was paid for “con, fidential decrees of the\' Minister of, Defense,” Including mobilization, plana end long lists of officers who, were unofficially registered in se, cret documents of the German army,, He invented a dramatic story about, the secret organizations of German, students and their connection with, t{,d Erzberger murder, assorting that, all those liable for military service, would form special units in case of a, new war against France. Details, were given by him about the activity, of secret recruiting officers for the, purpose of keeping ready former of, ficers of the Flying Corps and sup, plying them with machines for a, surprise attack on the French occu, pation army in case the French, should advance further into Ger, many., EDITED MANY DOCUMENTS, But Anspach did not content him, self with giving information of mili, tary character, but also edited vol, uminous documents on economic, conditions, as on the German export, and import .where it was indicated, that the German Government pur, posely concealed the truth about, conditions in Germany in order to, make efficient propaganda against, the Versailles treaty and the repara, tion demands., He fabricated statistics about the, "alleged unemployment in Germany*, and supplied the real figures, assert, ing that the Government only wanted, to evade heavier taxation. The Polish, Government availed itself of Ans, pach’s statistics on the rolling stock, of the German railways and the out, put of the German coal mines after, the plebiscite in tipper Silesia., He cleverly forged the stamps of, the Government offices and the sig, natures of well-known ministers and, backed up his stories by some real, facts taken from pamphlets and, books on one or the other subject so, that nobody ever suspected them of, being lalse. Day and .night he sat, over books and papers which he, took from the circulating libraries of, Berlin., Anspach entertained connections, with Paris, Brussels, Basle, Warsaw., Mainz, Wiesbaden and Brealau. In, order to make his “clients" absolute, ly sure that his information came, from authentic sources he pretended, to be a “councillor of the Ministry, of Economics,” only giving his in, formation on condition that it was, returned within a day, as otherwise, “he would get into trouble.”, “CONFERS” WITH EBERT, The crowning achievement o£ his, frauds is a “confidential talk of, Ebert, Wirth and Rathenau” prior to, the conference at Genoa, in which it, was asserted that the three states, men had discussed details of a plan, to sabotage the work of the Allies., At the same time he, sold to scjme, government “Secret Treaty Between, Finland and Czecho-Slovakia,” con, taining hundreds of clauses and, every deatil of a “millitary alliance”, between the\' two powers in case, they would be attacked by Poland or, Soviet. Russia. •, Years before Anspach "turned to, politics” he used to forge certificates, and university honors of degrees, en, abling purchasers to attend lectures, or settle down as teachers or doc, tors. He asserts that the honorary, degree of a doctor was bestowed on, him by the Bolshevist University of, Kasan through the Russia ex-pleni, potentiary Vigor Kopp at Berlin, and, that the German Minister of Educa, tion granted him a permit to carry, this title in Germany., The career of Eric Anspach is a, romance in itself., He #M born fct Hmmw, m tne‘, PruMiun province of Westphalia W, 1898.

Whle being nursed at, a hospital he wrote numerous arti, cles whioh happened to become, known to the Minister of Education,, who, on vending them, granted Ans, pach a special permit to attend lec, tpves at the university., After the war Anspach tried to, make his living writing for news, papers and for a short time belonged, to the staff of the Independents, paper “Freiheit,” when he was ar, rested and sent to prison for dis, tributing pamphlets urging the, masses to overthrow the present, government.

E. F., has startled, London by making his ddbut before, the King and Queen and winning their, applause., Echols, whose horhe is in Los Ange, les, stood in the wings of Daly's Thea, ter during a charity matinee hoping, that some performer would fail to ap, pear' and that he might be given an, opportunity to make his debut in Lon, don before the King and Queen. Fate, was kind and Sir Charles Hawtrey, was unable to appear. On a moment’s, notice young Echols was substituted, and won instant fame., In the following article Echols tells, of his efforts to win recognition:, I lived in California until the war,, then went to Camp Lewis, Washing, ton, where I used to sing for my, triends after the day s work was over., I was sent to .New York in November, 1918. Among others, I met Caruso, and his wife. Although it was ar, range^ that he would hear me. it un-., fortunately ngver came to pass., . , While in prance the^ opportunity, arose,for me to smg to Andre Caplet,, a condu^toi; of the Pari^ Opera, who, ;was thei connected witV the Amerl, | can llfjud School at Cliaumont. t-Ic, was veyy enthusiastic over the possi, bilities. ,, I was, demobilized ih Prance and, went out to Vienna and Czecho Slo, vakia with the American Relief Ad, ministration. I came to London and, j got a job at the American Embassy,, having put myself through business, I college in America. I went to many, teachers here and almost despaired of, finding one in whom 1 could have con, j fidence until, quite by accident I be, j gan to talk to George R. Ceiley at, etrazinni’s concert at the Albert Hall, i in October, 1919., LESSONS ARE STARTED, Lessons were started with him and, work carried on at the Embassy at the, same time. In July, 1921, I sang, at a dinner at the Lyceum Club at, which Sir Landon Ronald was pres, ent: After I sang he came up and, said “e-NOR-mous possibilities,” and, | with another year or two of hard, I study a great career ought to be the, | reward. I went to the Supreme Coun, cil in Paris with Ambassador Harvey, in August, 1921, and upon returning, left the Embassy. It had been my, great desire to continue working there, and studying until I could make a, debut in grand opera or concert, but, fate an unmusical government inter, vened., Then began a heartbreaking and, wearying round of singing at theaters, and for managers—when they would, hear me, which wasn’t every time I, applied—at the same time working in, the chorus of several' musical shows, to gain stage experience., Thfere had been several audiences, at Daly's, but nothing had come of, them, as quick desclsions had to be, made concerning other offers—for the, chorus)., An appointment for an audience, with Marlyn Morgan, the musical di, rector at Daly’s, was made. I was, late for rhe to keep that appointment.!, out of town land the train was too, Fate had stepped in again., ANOTHER APPOINTMENT MADE, Another appointment' was made for, Thursday’ I was fifteen minutes, ahfead of time and when the hour1 ap, preached wad told I must Wait, as Miss, Idly Elsie was rehearsing. After, whiting twfenty-five minutes; more 1, bd&hn to-think this would be ortty'an, rrflfer of a long fist of disappointments-., but patience was rewarded when, Mr. Morgan had‘me come down on, the stage. The stage seemed enor, mous, so bare and friendless. 1 be, gan to sing Cavaradossi’s lovely aria, “E Lucevan le Stelle,” from Tosca., When it was over, three ladies who, had been talking in the green room, were out ont the stage. One of them, was Miss Lily Elsie, whom I had not, known before. She was very kind, and it was arranged that I should, “stand by” at the charity matinee and, deputize in case anyone was unable, to appear. I was ready at the rise, of the curtain, but it was not known, until the program was half over wheth, or anyono would not appear., When it was announced that Sir, Charles Hawtrey was unable to ap, pear a few people began to go. hut, after “E Lucevan le Steelle” was be, gun they came hack and crowded into, the entrances. It was a hit nerve, racking, but the audience was gen, erously kind. • ., 1 FREIGHT BY AIR TO, BE EFFECTIVE SOON,, IS BELIEF OF EXPERT, LOS ANGELES, July 24. — Ameri- j, ca, within the next five years, will;, see the regular operation of air, way load carriers transporting heavy, freight and passengers at commerc, ially satisfactory rates, according to, Charles S. Hall, of this city, who, heads a- staff of experts engaged in, surveying air routes and testing in, ventions essential to the operation, o load-carrying types of aircraft., Hall gave a review of the sub, ject and expressed the belief that, the combination of features neces, sary to make airfreighting safe and, cheap enough to justify making an, established business of it is now i, available. Radio telephony, practical!, aerography, non-inflammable gas, which Is lighter than air, aluminum |, alloys to permit lightness in rrame-1, work construction, and the develop-1, ment of aerial navigation—these are I, a few features which have “arrived” j, to help make the building of large j, carriers for heavy loads possible, he, asserted., “We have worked for five jiears, on the problem of ‘profit and loss’, as part of our effort to get airway, rates down where business men, could see them,” said Hall, “and, there are three hig weaknesses in, the la'rge airship which militate, against adapting it for scheduled, commercial transportation., “One is that of safety, which is, now met by ground communication, and fog-flying possibilities through, development of the wireless. Safety j, is also advanced by the possibility!, of a non-inflammable levitating gas I, “The second weakness is the lack I, of cheap power. We have not as yet, the proper power, for gasoline, is not, cheap fuel, and it takes up a great, deal of weight that might otherwise, go into ‘pay’ load. This will prob, ably be overcome after the air car, riers are in operation, for inventors, will then understand what is needed, most., ‘‘The third and most vital de, ficiency in adapting the military air, ship to commercal work is the pay, handled on the ground by soldiers, and sailors, regardless of whether, five or 500 men may be needed. Me, chanical control is therefore abso, lutely necessary in handling the, load-carrying ships., “We have attacked the. problem, both from the air and ground view, point, and the result-Is a new type, of propeller which can give im, mediate efficiency when desired., This invention will be introduced, shortly for practical use on air, craft, Hall said., SWEDISH SINGERS HOLD, CONVENTION IN DENVER, DENVER, July 24. — An orgy of, Orpheus” was staged in Denver to, day, when the quadrennial conven, tion of the American Union of, Swedish Singers met., The convention was featured by, one of the greatest musical festi, vals ever held in the United States., Male singers of Swedish choruses, from all parts of the country unit, ed in a chorus of morq than 400, voices., Soloists for the occasion included, Mme.

I.), SHOOTING BLANK CARTRIDGES, - t, That was a great broadside fired from Ot, tawa V cently when the Canadian Cabinet is, sued \'an Order in Council prohibiting Ameri, can fishing boats from purchasing bait in Can, ada unless they deliver their cargoes to Can, adian ports. But the guns were loaded with, blank cartridges., If the Poindexter amendment should ac, complish the purpose it is designed to ac, complish , no American fisherman .would want, to purchase bait in a Canadian port. They, would have no cause to do so. They would, want to buy their bait in American ports, where a great many of them buy it now., The noise from the blank cartridges ex, ploded at Ottawa does serve one purpose, how, ever. Tt calls attention to the fact that in, addition to other results that are sought to be, accomplished by the Poindexter amendment, it would make an additional market for Al, aska herring and, therefore, more business for, American fishermen. The herring that Ameri, can fishermen purchase at Prince Rupert now, is caught by Canadian fishermen, operating in, Canadian waters with Canadian equipment., If the Poindexter amendment should finally, become the law, the halibut fishermen would, purchase American herring, caught by Ameri, can fishermen with American equipment in, American waters, for bait., There are enough herring in Alaskan waters, to feed herring eaters everywhere and to sup, ply the bait markets of the continent. The one, difficulty with the herring industry in Alaska, in the past has been lack of a satisfactory, market. The Poindexter amendment-, designed, to bring to Alaskan ports an American traffic, in American products | between American, points, will, if it should become the law, make, an outlet for more Alaskan herring and there, by stimulate Alaskan fishing. The Order in, Council simply calls attention to this fact. —, Alaska Daily Empire., SIMILARITY OF CONDITIONS, It may have been .just a coincidence but af, ter listening to the reading of the Declara, tion of Independence on the occasion of the, recent celebration and having our minds re, freshed as to the causes—mistreatment, op, pression, taxation without representation and, tyranical usurpation in many ways—that in, spired its conception, it was peculiarly fitting, that Governor Bone should follow its reading, with the prediction that, possibly within ten, years, Alaska will have a place in the ranks, of the sisterhood of states and be free from the, abuse and mistreatment to which she is now, subjected to through lack of understanding at, Washington. Not that Alaska should follow, the example of the colonies in seceding from, the parent stem, but. that she desires freedom, to govern herself instead of being subjected, by others who know not her conditions and re, quirements—buffetted around, hogtied and, abused by forty different bureaus with as, many different heads, few of whom have any, conception of the resources possibilities or re, quirements of the northern domain., Governor Bone has been here sufficiently, long to locate the canker-worm that is gnaw, insjTat the vitals of and the vampires that are, sucking the life blood from Alaska and he sees, the end coining if something is not. done soon., He realizes that self-government is the one, panacea that will bring Alaska into her own, —rehabilitate her and place her on the pedestal, on which her God-given natural advantages, predestinate that she should stand., Alaska’s condition today is very^similar, to that of the colonies previous to 177G. She, is the victim of long distance government and, tbe oppression that necessarily accompamei, it_not maliciously but through pitiable and, lamentable ignorance of her requirements.—, Stroilers’ Weekly., Voice of the Alaska Press, HAVE TO GET ANOTHER BOY, For two consecutive Fourth of July celebrations in, Our Town we have, pulled and hauled and heav««, •,0\'d” until completely exhausted to land Aviator Pres!, here for the Celebration and both times we have failed., The first time it was his fault or misfortune-the sec, ond time it was Our fault; knowing nothing about f.y, ing, fliers, their tricks and their manners, we shou\'d, not have attempted to deal with them.

TERN, WRANGELL, July 24. — Mrs. Elsa, Thomson, who sailed from Cordova on, the steamship Northwestern last Wed, nesday, bound for her old home in Chi, ij. eago, was the heroine of an unusual, experience as the ship was sailing, through Sumner Strait. Mrs. Thom, son, who has delighted the people of, Cordova during the past eight months,, with her splendid interpretation of, the organ at the Empress Theater,, was ensconced on a steamer chair on, the upper deck with her purse in her, lap, enjoying the fine weather and mag, ’Cnificent scenery of the Inside Passage,, and doubtless dreaming of the lake, front and Michigan Boulevard in her, beloved Chicago., In some unaccountable manner her, purse slipped out of her lap and while, she sat momentarily frozen with, horror, It bounded gracefully under, neath the rail, and with a resounding, flop landed on the bosom of the Pa-i, pltic Ocean. .The purse contained, nine hundred dollars, and recovering, from her stagnation, Mrs. Thomson, Immediately reported her loss to Cap, ,*1» Nord, pulling oat all the atops,, *aud playing heavy on the tremelo. *, Bluff old Captain Nord, with his In, herent gallantry of his calling. Imme, diately turned his ship around and sent, out a life boat In search of the lady\'s, purse. After cruising aronnd for about, twenty minutes, with the passengers, lining the rail, and shouting encour, agement to the sailors, a cry from the, life boat informed the anxious owner \\, of the purse that her money had been!, found., When the life boat returned to the, Northwestern amid the cheers of the, passengers, the lost purse was proud, ly brought on board and presented to, its fair owner with fitting ceremonies,, and much advice from her friends on, board, many of whom kindly offered, to take charge of her money, during, I the remainder of the voyage. How, ever, after considering all offers, Mrs., Thomson affirmed that she preferred, to trust her weath to Purser Ed Mor, gan, and accordingly the pocketbook, with its precious cargo was carefully, laid away in the steamer’s safe., The affair created so much discus, sion on board that after the evening, meal, one woman, seeking to profit, by Mrs. Thomson’s experience, anx, iously asked the purser to deposit her, purse in the safe also, and when Mr., Morgan courteously agreed to do so,, she left with him a pocketbook con, taining two dollars., LABOR BOARD CHIEF’S, DAUGHTER SECRETARY, IN HER FATHER’S OFFICE, CHICAGO, July 24. — Clinging to, the “somewhat obsolete” theory that, every girl should try to do something, worth while\', Miss Anna B.
