        <pre>['[THE ALASKA DAILY EMPIRE, JUNEAU, ALASKA, SATURDAY, JULY 19, 1913. PRICE TEN CENTS, Jones Threatened to Kill, MacDonald Says Witnesses, The defense in the MaeDonahl case, Is introducing testimony today to, prove that N. C. Jones, for killing, whom MaeDonahl is being tried, was, insane and that he had threatened to, kill MacDonald if the latter continued, to refuse to close the Treadwell mines, on Sunday. The witnesses are giving, evidence that, Jones was a religious, fanatic, and that he regarded himself, as an instrument of dod, charge by, the Almighty to enforce the observ, ance of the Holy Sabath by the Tread, well mine If to do that should neces, sitate the rmoval of MacDonald, then, superintendent of the mine, from, earth., Skagway Juror Continue Testifying., Robert M. Becker, of Skagway, 82, years of age, was the last of the fa, mous Skagway grand jury that inves, tigated the tragedy in which Joseph, MacDonald shot and killed N. (\\ Jones, at Treadwell in 1902 to be called as, n witness at the trial of MacDonald, that is now in progress at Juneau to, impeach? witnesses for the prosecu, tion. By a peculiar coincidence he, served on both of the grand juries, that passed upon the question of indict, ing MacDonald? the one at Skagway, In the summer of 1902, which refused, to find a true bill, and the one at Ju, neau last winter which returned the, indictment under which MacDonald, is now answering before a court and, jury., From the standpoint of the defense,, J. D. Carroll, foreman of the Skagway, grand jury made the best witness, of all those called to prove what wit, nesses had testified to at Skagway., His recollection of the occurrences in, and before the inquisitorial body was, clearer than that of any of his fellow, jurymen., Mr. Carroll said that he was in, charge of a tug boat about the time, of the grand jury\'s meeting. After, he had been summoned on the Skag- ,, way grand jury, and before the grand, jury met, he went to Treadwell, he, said, to make a contract for towage, with MacDonald. He said that he went, over the ground where the shooting, occurred, but without any" intention of, using his observation at the grand, jury session. Afterward he drew, he, testified, a map of the ground from his, recollection, and from Mrs. Mark\'s tes, timony, traced the way she walked,, He said that he remembered that Mrs., Marks had not testified that she had, a child with her., Like the grand jurors who had pre, ceded him. he identified" the testimony, of the four witnesses sought to be lm- :, peached, as read by Mr. Hellenthal,, He said, further, that none of them, had testified to seeing the shooting., On cross examination he was asked, how often he had been to the sawmill,, and since he had been at Juneau on, this occasion, and he said several, times. He was aske dto draw a, sketch of the sawmill and surround, ings, to show his faculty of location,, but he declined., Robert M. Becker also identified, the statement read by Mr. Hellenthal, as the testimony of the four witness, es sought to be impeached. In cross, examination he was asked, if, as a, member of the last grand jury, he had, told that grand jury that these wit, nesses had testified entirely different, and he said that he had not, nor had, he called the attention of the prosecut, ing attorney to it. He was asked if, he could remember any of the mem, bers of the last grand jury with whom, he sat for six weeks last fall and he, could remebre only two. Asked if he j, could remember any of the other mat- !, ters taken up by the last grand jury, ), he said that he could not except that ,, he remembered in a general way that, there was something about sales of, liquor to the natives., Legal Battle Over Testimony., The afternoon session yesterday, closed in a legal battle over the offer, of the defense to introduce testimony, ending to prove Jones\' insanity, and, alleged threats he had made against <, the life of MacDonald before the lat, ter killed him. A deposition was of, fered by Clark Miller, now of Oregon,, in which Miller declared that he be, lieved Jones was insane, and that he, had threatened MacDonald. The court, ruled when ojection was offered, that, it was not admissable unless some, avert act on the part of Jones was, first proved., The defense considered this a very, material point, and the jury wa? ex, cused until the court could hear coun, sel and pass on this and similar testi, mony., Court Holds With Defense., This morning the court held that, the testimony bearing on Jone\'s san, ity and threats was admissable, and, the Miller deposition was read to the, jury, as was a deposition of M. D., Henderson, who for several years, has been mining in Mexico near Mac, Donald, swore that just before the, murder he had been an employye of, Tread well, and while was waiting on, the dock for a boat he met Jones,, whom he told that he had been dis, chraged, whereupon Jones told him to, stick around awhile, as he (Jones), expected to be superintendent him, self in a few days through the dispen, sation of the Almighty, who hal be, come disgusted with failure of Mac, Donald to close the mines on Sunday., The testimony of Doctor LapBli giv, e nat the inquest was also read. Doc, tor Lapsi attended Jones prior to his, death. He testified that Jones prayed, a good deal, and made a number of re, ligious utterances. He said Jones re, marked: "The Lord will take care of, me, because I came here on his bus, iness." He also said, according to, for. Lapslie, that it was all his (Jones\'), fault., Jones Threatened to Kill MacDonald, Peter Early, George Bach and Mar, tin Olson testified that they had had, conversations with Jones in which he, had threatened to kill MacDonald., Peter Karly said that he and Jones, were good friends, and that Jones had, frequently expressed a desire to go, out to Yankee Cove, and Early, on, this particular occasion was passing, Jones\' cabin when Jones beckoned him, over, When he arrived at the door., Early asked Jones to come with him, on that trip. Jones replied that he, was too busy with the Lord\'s and the, Treadwell\'s business. He had de, manded, he said, in the name of the, Lord, that the mines should be closed, down, and MacDonald had promised to, give him a definate answer: that the, Lord had selected him, as His instru, ment for the removal of MacDonald, from the earth in case MacDonald j, stood pat on his resolutions to keep, the mines working on Sunday. So it, was quite impossible that he could, go to Yankee Cove at that time., George Back testified that he had, heard Jones say that he was glad, President McKinley was shot., o ? O ft?, BASE BALL GAME, TOMORROW PERHAPS, If the sun gets out today and the, weather man is kind for 36 hours,, there will undoubtedly be a hot game, of baseball on the local grounds to, morrow, Manager Tom Kadonich, says that he don\'t feel like talking, baseball with the clouds hanging so, low and a penetrating mist mussing, things up, ".We can\'t practice in this, kind of weather," he said, "but if the, weather is suitable, there will be a, game on Sunday.", He refused to say anything about, the line-up, further than the best tim, ber on the list will be in the game., "You might say," said Tom, "that per, haps a new man will be wearing a, Pirate uniform on Sunday ? no, 1, can\'t tell the man\'s name.", A talk with different members of ?, the Pirate band brings forth optimis, tic results. The game should be a, cinch most of them think. Ben Hunt, has been married since the last game, was played at Douglas ? he will have, to win now ? so the boys all say., There promises to be a banner, crowd out to witness this Sunday, game. Many feel that the baseball, season is rapidly drawing to a close, and want to get all there is coming., The Islanders will undoubtedly be, accompanied by a large crowd. They, have been winning and winners will, have their followers., Tigers Getting Chesty., The C. W. Young Tigers are puffed, up on acount of their victories over ;, the Alaska-Gastineau Terriers and j, they are coming out in force. It will, not be surprising if Charley Carter, does not megaphone a challenge to, play the Juneau Pirates and after that i, the Douglas - Treadwell Wildcats. !, "We\'ve got just about the best team 1, on Gastineau channel," said Juneau\'s j, mayor with a complacent smile.", o? o ? o, BIDS RETURNED ON, SCHOOL HOUSE, A committee for the city council, met with the school board in the, council chambers Thursday to consid, er bids for the building of the new, school house. There were protests, from several contractors, however,, that the plans were lacking in detail,, and the bids were therefore not op, ened and were returned to the bidders, unopened. The plans had also early, in the afternoon been experted by, City Engineer B. D. Blakeslee and by, Architect Richard Wulzen, who re, commended that the plans be re, ferred back to the author for further, detail., There will be a special meeting, called when these plans are revised, and a new call for bids will be issued., LICENSE MONEY, * IS DISTRIBUTED, Judge Fred M.

L. GAGE\'S, tf]', '[ALASKA DAILY EMPIRE, J. F. A. STRONG, JOHN W. TROY, Editor., Telephone No. 3-7- i, Entered as second-class matter November 7, 1912 at the postofflce at Ju, neau, Alaska, under the Act of March 3, 1879., SUBSCRIPTION RATES:, Q?e year, by mail $10.00, Six mouths, by mail 6.00, Per month, delivered . . 1.00 :, FREE DELIVERY FOR JUNEAU., THE growth of Juneau is strikingly illustrated by the fact that, the city has reached the business proportions which will en, able it to have a free delivery system inaugurated by the, postoffice department. It is quite possible that such an innova, tion is neither wanted nor needed. The physical contour of the, town is such that renders it somewhat compact, and no portion, is very far removed from the postottice. The installation of a, free delivery system would also call for a considerable expendit, ure by the city for the improvement of streets and the laying, of sidewalks. Rut these are much-needed, anyway, and the ad, ditional expense entailed should be considered as a public bene, fit. Sidewalks are needed for the comfort and conveniece of the, public, whether there be free mail delivery or not. It denotes, progress and prosperity, and if the postotfice department is of, the mind that Juneau is entitled to free delivery let us have it, by all means. ? It would also add to the payroll, a little, and every, little helps., The fact that a number of women in Denver are circulating, petitions for the recall of Judge Ben Lindsey and the abolition, of the Juvenile Court may not be deemed a militancy, but it, threatens revolution in the ranks., COLONEL WATTERSON ON "HYSTERIA", COLONEL HENRY WATTERSON delivered an address at, Erie, Pa., a few days ago, the occasion being the centenary, celebration of Admiral Perry\'s victory over the British on, Lake Erie. The Colonel, as usual, spoke in a pessimistic vein,, and he told his audience that there fs in our public life a hysteria, for change which expresses itself in "making and unmaking, laws," in seeing the evils of too much legislation, yet "calling for, more." Colonel Watterson said in prefacing his speech that it, was his last public address, and if this be so his swan song, should be sung long hereafter and to a more cheerful tune., The period of hysteria has passed. We have emerged from, it. Ours is a time rather of accounting, of studying the books,, of proceeding upon fact and principle. We have a program, a, well thought-out scheme of public action; and we are putting, it into effect calmly and coolly, without haste, or hesitation or, tumult. In that reasoned procedure we have as a national lead, er one of the ablest men and clearest thinkers that have arisen, in recent political life., The only hysteria that has been noted of late is in the fran, tic squirmings of the worms of privilege, uncovered in the clear, ing-up process, and their blind, frantic efforts to burrow once, more into the safety of darkness., Ambassador Page disappointed some hearers in London by, reading his Fourth of July speech. But that is wiser than to, disappoint a million times as many people by saying something, indiscreet offhand., FOX FARMING IN ALASKA, A HE Secretary of Commerce announces that Uncle Sam has, a bunch of islands in Alaska waters that will be leased at, not less than two hundred dollars per island, for fox-breed, ing purposes. And in order to encourage the industry it is an- ,, nounced that a limited number of blue foxes will be supplied to, intending fox-farmers ? at a moderate price, we suppose ? for, breeding purposes., While not professing to know a lot about raising foxes, we, believe that it is susceptible of great expansion. It has been, demonstrated to be a success elsewhere and so it should be in, Alaska, if followed along practical lines. It is stated that not, a few men are now starting fox farms in different sections of, the Territory. There is a large demand for the product, and, the market is bound to increase with the passing of the years., Fur-bearing animals are yearly becoming scarcer and the prices, will rise higher and higher with their steady decrease., The cable ship Burnside apparently is out of commission just, as frequently as the military cable. Or are her officers too busy, with pink teas?, THE NEW ORDER OF MARRIAGE, T GRANDDAUGHTER of the poet Longfellow and a young, Harvard graduate have achieved the distinction of becom, ing the principals of the most "advanced" marriage yet, performed in Massachusetts. They were married without bell,, book or candle, no clergyman hearing their vows but the Town, Clerk recording their intention to live together. There was no, wedding march and none of the usual rites, though for some, unknown reason the symbolism of the ring was retained. But, instead of the customary ritual of the outworn marriage creed,, there was the pledge of the bride and groom to be "true com, rades and helpmates" and "the assurance of a physician" that, they were "fitted for the high calling of parenthood.", What the author of "Hiawatha," with his sentimental views, of marriage, might think of certificated matrimony we may not, know. What have grandfathers to do with the matter? It is, enough to realize that the parties to this union will enjoy as, much transient celebrity as did the first couple who were married, in a lion\'s cage or in a balloon., The Rapid Transit! What a misnomer!, GLEANINGS FROM GREAT, NORTHERN EMPIRE, The Great Boulder Company, of, l^ondon, one of the biggeet mine-own, ing corporations of the world, has >, taken over the option of the Alaska, Venture Syndicate on the Bugge and, nearby properties in the Ketchikan, district.

Heifner has returned to, Seattle from Washington, where he, spent several months in the interest, of the progressive element of the Dem, ocratic party of his State and in urg, ing quick action on Alaska matter by, the administration and Congress. He, is quoted in interviews given Seattle, papers as saying that the President, has stood with the progressive Dem, ocrats of Washington State in every, instance where he has been accurate, ly informed, and that there will be, speedy action on Alaska problems,, and that it will be satisfactory to the, people of Alaska and those that have, legitimate interest in the development, of the Territory., Quoting Mr. Heifner, the Seattle, Sun says:, "Speedy action in Alaska matters, may be expected from President Wil, son. He is a convert to the idea of, a government railroad in Alaska. The, Senate committee has supported this, idea unanimously and the matter will, be taken up at this session of Con, gress unless it is felt it will interfere, with the tariff and currency ques, tions.", o ? o ? o, WELL-KNOWN ALASKAN, COMES FROM IDITAROD, Albert Wile arrived in Juneau on, the Humboldt last night, coming out, from Iditarod via Dawson and the up, per Yukon. Mr. Wile has been en, j gaged in business and in mining in, Alaska for several years, principally, in Nome during the early days and lat, er in Iditarod. He will stop in Ju, neau for a short while and look the, j country over., Speaking of Iditarod, Mr. Wile said, the lower Yukon camp is still on the, map, and is still a good producer. He, says there are -now between 1200 and, 1500 people, all told, in Iditarod, and, all of them are prosperous. y About, 400 men are working at mining at the, present time. There has been a short, age oT waty all season, and this has, been a drawback, but, he says, if wa, ter had been plentiful there would, have been a shortage of men., The C.uggenheims are operating one, dredge on Flat creek, and employ, about 40 men. Everybody is doing, well, and all are satisfied., o ? o ? o?, VICE-PRESIDENT IS, AGAINST DEATH PENALTY, ? o-o ?, State Representative Frank P. Goss,, author of the bill abolishing the death, penalty in first degree murder in, Washington, passed by the last legis, lature and approved by the Governor,, has received a letter from Vice-Ppresi, dent Thos. R. Marshall, in which he, says:, "I am indeed glad to know that you, ! have abolished the death penalty in, Washington. Upon mature delibera, tion I believe that when sentenced for, life one ought not to have executive, clemency extended to him unless sub, sequent facts disclose that the killing, was not willful or premeditated.", This was the attitude assumed by, Mr. Goss in presenting his arguments, to the legislature, and in line with the, idea he introduced a companion bill, providing that pardons should not is, sue in first degree murder unless such, facts were produced. The house passed, i the bill, but the Senate did not con, sider it. ? Seattle Post-Intelligencer., o ? o ? o, "JEANIE" WILL MAKE, MANY NORTHERN I\'ORTS, The steamship Jeanie, of the W.
