Mr. Parks gays\nthey were fed on meal and hulls\nsince last May. He has about 300\nmore steers on feed in his pens and\n_\'i*) of them are now about ready for\nmarket. Mr. Parke, while not sat\nisfied with this sale, says he is con\nvinced that he could have realized\nno more for his steers had they\nbeen offered for sale at a northern\nmarket. They were threes and fours,\nmostly threes.\nIn speaking of crop conditions in\nhis county—Ellis—Mr. 1\'arks said:\n"Well, cotton is turning out better\nthan was expected earlier in the\nseason. In some portions of the J\ncounty three-fourths of a bale to\nthe acre, while in other sections\nonly a half bale will be raised.

He\nhad been picking cotton that day\nand about 3 o\'clock left the field to\ngo to the house. When other mem\nbers of the family returned to the\nhouse in the evening they found his\ndead body in a pool of blood. The\nyoung man put an end to his life\nwith a shotgun, one load of shot\ntearing his head to pieces. He tied\na string to the triggers of the gun\nand in this way discharged one bar\nrel.

A Solo\nmon is needed at that convention,\nbut I don\'t think he is there, even\niu spirit. If ever there was atime in\nthe history of the world when a Sol\nomon sboald be among us it is now.\nThere are new complications arising·\nevery day, and if he had been per\nmitted to meander along down the\ncrooked corridors of time to the\npresent aire I do not think he could\nhave remarked with such sad in\nsistence, "There is no new thing un\nder the sun." Rather he would\nhave agreed with the more modern\nindividual who declared with great\nemphasis, "Wonders will never\ncease!" Imagine Solomon tackling\nthe problem of "Ann\'s age," or any\nother woman\'s age as to that! His\nthinking cap would have grown\ngrey with working at it. I have\nspent sleepless days and nights over\nthe puzzle, and have repented, and\nam heartily sorry I ever chanced to\nsee the thing in print. I labored at\nit until I couldn\'t even have told\nMary\'s age to save my life. I gave\nnp everything else for that. 1 ceased\ntrying to solve the riddle of the\nEgyptian sphinx, I quit brooding\nover the "Seven Wonders of the\nWorld." I wouldn\'t have listened\neven if some one had told me who\nstruck Rillie Patterson. I went into\nthe mystery with all the time and\nI talent I had and yet today I know\nI as little about Ann\'s age as I am\nwilling to tell abou\' my own. It is\nI maddening! And here\'s a wonder of\nthe world up to-date: I have just\nbe^n told a dear little lady of our\ncity, an unmarried lady at that—good\nas gold, sound as a silver dollar—is\nactually going to celebrate her near\nby fiftieth birthday! I fainted sev\neral times when I heard it. I had\nnot known such admirable temeritv\nbefore, and yet \'tis a precedent de\nvoutly to be shunned. And here\'s an\nother: A minister, a regularly o«\ndaiued minister of the gospel, the\npastor of a church in » town not so\nfar away, stood up in a pulpit the\nother day and requested the people\nto reduce his salary one-fifth, claim\ning that as times were so hard he\nbelieved they were paying him too\nmuch. Too muoh—think of that\'\nReduce his salary, not raise it.\nFainting didn\'t begin to do this case\njustice, I have been looking for the\nworld to come to an end ever since.\n\'Tisn\'t everybody who sings \'Oil\nTime Religion is Good Enough ι r\nMe," who reallv and truly mean* it\nI never heard of the like before Hi\nall the length and breadth of my\nlife, and J am one of those who re\nfuse to mention birthdays, much\nless celebrate them. There was a\ntime when a religious meeting was\ngrand, glorious and good accordingto\nthe number of "lost souls" redeemed\nand brought into the folds of the\nchurch, but in this fast age the\ngrand and glorious business is meas\nured altogether by the "collections"\nmade, the hard, cold cash secured,\nand we hear all too little about the\ngospel of Christ perhaps because it\nisn\'t free. Going the rounds of the\nnewspapers recently was a little ar\nticle describing a certain disease\ncalled "Morbus Sabbaticus," which\nattacked people only on Sunday at\nchurch going time, and continued\nwith more or less severity until the\nhour for religious servciea was over\nIt was pretty good as far as it wont,\nbut it didn\'t rfo far enough, it gave\nthe symptoms of the disease, and\nits cure, but failed to mention the\ncause. You might cure a disease\nand then be liable to another attack\nunless the cause were removed.\nThere are two sick·* to every ques\ntion—sometimes more -and as there\nis no cause without effect, so there\nis no effect without cause You\ncan\'t jtiil a weed by cutting- off the\nthe top. You can\'t exterminate the\nboll weevil until you find oat the\norigin thereof and make war on that.\nRemove the cause and the effect\nwill never have any existence worth\na copper cent. If a speaker has\nsomething to say, the right way of\nsaying it, and the price of admission\nisn\'t too high, the people are not go\ning to be attacked with any indispo\nsition that will keep them away and\nprevent them hearing it.
