Not only\nin this state, but in every other state,\nthe political ibosses have always\nnamed the delegates, and they have\nalways been extremely careful to\nname only such men for delegates as\nwould fall in easily with the ways\nof the political boss. In a word,\nthe delegate was a mere chattel, to\nbe traded and swapped, or bought\nand sold, according to the need and\nambition of political plunderers.\nIt is a rank insult to public intel\nligence to assert, as the Statesman\ndoes, that political bosses have re\nmained in power only because elec\ntors have refused to participate in\nelections to name delegates to con\nventions. The politicians, trained in\nthe ways of the game, and always\norganized, and always on the alert,\nand not the electors, have, as a rule,\nnamed the delegates. Even wh.?n\nthe electors have participated in the\nselection of delegates, the bosses\nhave enjoyed the exceptional advan\ntage of the last throw; they have\nmanipulated the convention, and, in\nfurtherance of a foul purpose, have\nnot hesitated in the convention to\ndebauch men of easy inclination.\nThat is tlie pnin, known and ac\ncepted truth, and that is precisely\nvhy citizens of the several state\'\n• h\'.tv: forced their legislatures io pro\nvide for the direct primary riethod\nof nominating public officers. The\npeople are siclj;. of «>6liticar *bossism;\nthe state of\' sick if\nit and such .newspapers-\'and politi\ncians of this state as may still be in\nclined to quarrel with the primary\nprinciple may as well accept the re\ncent act as the final judgment of\nthe people of this state, for if that\nact isn\'t constitutional, one that\nconstitutional will be passed.—P.

WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 83,1007.\nThe Defects of the\nAntitrust Law.\nBy CHARLES G. DAWES, Former Comptroller of the Currency.\n" HE Sherman antitrust law makes criminal all agree-\nCments in restraint of trade, whether they are IN\nHERENTLY criminal or not. It makes in these\ngeneral terms something criminal without further\ndefinition. Now, this is THE DAY OF THE\nTRADE AGREEMENT in the United States.\nWe have national, city, state and district agreements in restraint of\ntrade, and they are not agreements for the purpose always of extort\ning an unreasonable price. I would not for a moment defend an\nagreement in restraint of trade which had for its purpose the extort\ning from the public of an unreasonable price. It should be under the\nban of the law. But the trouble with the Sherman antitrust law is\nthat it makes EQUALLY CRIMINAL an agreement in restraint\nof trade which is inherently innocent.\nAn agreement in restraint of trade not to sell below cost IS NOT\nOF NECESSITY A DISADVANTAGE AND INJURY to a\ncommunity, for certainly we have heard a great deal recently about\ngreat institutions underselling for a period of time in certain local\nities, selling below cost for the purpose of crushing out competition in\norder that they may later exercise a monopoly and raise the price. A\ngreat many of these agreements in restraint of trade are for the pur\npose of existence, not of extortion, of letting a reasonable amount of\ncompetition exist.\nTHE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW ACTUALLY PUTS A PREMIUM\nUPON A CONSOLIDATION AND CONCENTRATION UP TO A CER\nTAIN POINT, FOR PROVIDED ALL COMPETITION IS NOT DE\nSTROYED IT ENCOURAGES THE CONSOLIDATION OF COMPETING\nCORPORATIONS UP TO A CERTAIN POINT, BECAUSE THEY CAN\nDO LEGALLY THEN AS A CORPORATION WHAT WOULD BE IL\nLEGAL AND CRIMINAL IF DONE AS SEPARATE CORPORATIONS\nUNDER A TRADE AGREEMENT. THE VERY EFFECT OF THAT\nLAW HAS BEEN TO ENCOURAGE THE MORE RAPID CRUSHING\nOUT OF COMPETITION SN THIS COUNTRY.\nIf REAL PROGRESS is to be made toward the solution of the\nvexed industrial problems which confront the nation, this law should\nbe amended so as to clearly define what shall constitute illegality in\ntrade agreements.\nThe Church Is Too\nIndifferent to\nthe Masses.\nBy Bishop HENRY C POTTER of New York.\nHERE is no more RIGHTEOUS ARRAIGNMENT\nOF THE CHURCH of our time than its indiffer\nence to the social conditions of the classes made up\nof less favored men and women down in the gutter.\nThe church has justly been severely criticised for its\nlack of interest in the mental, moral and physical\nupbuilding of the masses. The task of the church is to translate the\nmind of Christ, iirst by sympathy, then by painstaking curiosity. This\ncuriosity should lead you to know something of that stratum of\nlife below that in which you are wont to move. SUCH SYMPA\nTHETIC CURIOSITY WILL SOONER OR LATER LEAD\nTO THE ONLY HOPE OF THE SOCIAL UNREST OF OUR\nTIME, AND THAT IS PERSONAL SERVICE.\nz\nIn our ecclesiastical relations we have been INTIMIDATED\nfrom translating our relations to the world into human sympathy for\nfear of dropping into what has been called the institutional church,\nbut if an institutional church be the means of bringing the church\ninto profound sympathy with HE MAN LIFE, then the founder of\nour religion instituted the institutional church. .\nTHE CHURCH SHOULD TAKE ACTIVE STEPS TO CURE THE\nPHYSICAL AND MENTAL AS WELL AS THE RELIGIOUS ILLS OF\nTHE PEOPLE. THE CHURCHS NEGLECT OF THIS VITAL WORK\nCANNOT BE REMEDIED TOO GOON. IT HAS NEGLECTED ITS\nMOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION. >\nTlie great cause of our social unrest is that MONSTROUS PRO\nFUSION AND EXTRAVAGANCE which I am inclined to con\nsider the worst note in our American civilization. Ostentatious wealth\ncannot be too scathingly condemned.\nI become more and more convinced that the impatience of the\nmasses comes more from the ABUSE of wealth than from any other\ncause. Is it any wonder that the average worker in the tenements\nbecomes wrought up at what he considers the great injustice of society\nwhen he sees wealth spent lavishly around him, while he struggles in\nmisery ?\nTHE MODERN WORKMAN IS MOST INFLAMMABLE MATERIAL\nFOR SOCIAL UNREST. THE WONDER IS NOT THAT WE HAVE\nPRODUCED SUCH RESULTS, BUT THAT RESULTS ARE NOT\nWORSE.\nThe Meaning of Sunday Rest.\nBy tht My. SIDNEY C PARTRIDGE. ProteiUnt Episcopalian BUhop of\nKyoto. Japan.\ndoes rest mean ? To how many does it mean the get\n■ ■ I tiug away from the busy city, with its noisy streets and\nfactories, to the country and to nature? And WHAT\nDOES SUNDAY MEAN? To the masses it means\nmuch the same thing, that day of rest, Sunday.\nThe Christian DAY OF REST should not be a day of enforced\ncessation of labor, not the steel bound rules and the "Thou shalt not*\'\nof the ancient Jewish Sabbath or the rigid Puritan Sunday with ite\n• strict blue laws.\nIT SHOULD BE A DAY WHEN THE CHURCHES, THE MUSEUMS\nAND THE PARKS ARE THROWN OPEN TO ALL THE POOR AND\nTHOSE THAT NEED REST ESPECIALLY, A DAY OF PHYSICAL\nREST, A CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND A FITTING OF THE\nMIND FOR A HIGHER SPHERE.\nLOGGERS WANTED —I wish to get\nin communication with parties who\nwill take a logging contract.

It is only fair to say that when\nit comes to tbe transportation of valua\nbles tbe express companies have a\nmuch cbeaper and safer service. The\nexpress company gives a receipt with\na guarantee limiting the amount of\nguarantee by the amount of charges\npaid. In case of registered packages\nthe government does agree to make\ngood a loss up to $25 in east the sender\nof tbe lost package proves that amount\nof value. Under certain conditions the\nguarantee may be raised to $100, but\nmuch formality is required, and in view\nof the rates of postage on parcels—\nnamely, 16 cents per pound, or G4 cents\nfor a four ponnd package— the advan\ntage seems in tbe long run to be with\nthe express companies.\nRegistered mail is cheap, and where\nprofit delivery as well as security is\ndesired both ends,are often attained bj\npatronizing this service. In the case\nof ordinary mail the government as\nsumes no responsibility whatever. A\nletter dropped into a box or a slot is\nIntrusted to the service without condi\ntiou or obligation. For the postage\npaid the United States undertakes to\ntransport Ihe packet to its destination\nand to deliver it into tbe hands of the\naddressee or his agent. If losses ocoui\nthrough railroad wrecks or dishonesty\nthe sender suffers. Nevertheless the\npercentage of loss is remarkably small\nConsidering the vast volume of maf\nbandied by tbe United States govern\nment In tbe course of a year the sendei\nis virtually guaranteed against loss,\nlie Is warned officially not to intrust\nmoney to the ordinary service, and he\ndoes so at his own risk when be dis\nregards this caution.\nProbably but few of the patrons of\nthe special delivery mail service are\naware that tbe government assumes\nno obligation whatever as to loss on\nthis class of matter. Tbe package is\non tbe same basis as ordinary or un\nregistered mail. All that tlie govern\nment undertakes for the exceedingly\nhigh rate of extra postage demanded Is\nto hasten tbe packet to its destination\nby other than tbe regular means of de\nlivery and to deliver It to the person\naddressed. For "hurry up" messages\nthat guarantee is well worth tbe addi\ntional postage. But tbe citizen bas no\ncase against the government if the\npackage Is delayed or delivered to tbe\nwrong person or lost.\nDepression In Iron.\nFor the first time in more than two\nyears really serious doubts are enter\ntained as to the future of the iron and\nsteel trade. Beginning with a sudden\nrevival late in WO4 from the depression\nwhich began in the latter part of t9C3.\nsays the Irou Trade Review, the irou\nand steel trade has had a period oi\nprosperity which it is not straining the\npoint to say lias never been equaled.\nEarly in this period tbeiy were Some\ndoubts as to the genuineness of the\nmovement, but soon all doubts were\ndispelled. At no lime in was\nthere serious question as to the future,\naud in 1906 there was hesitancy only\nfor a brief spell during the second\nquarter, when tome southern iron i>ro\nducers saw fit to sell iron into the fu\nture at as low as $13.\nThe situation now is radically di.Ter\nent. For two months all Iron and stec."\nmarkets have been ,very quiet. The\ncontrast with the corresi»onding period\nof last year is most marked.\nRaising the wages of factory girls in\norder to induce thorn to forego mar\nriage and remain at work is one of the\nlatest innovations in the industrial\nworld. Cupid must he particularly\nbusy in communities where it is neces\nsary to meet him in this way. But it\'s\nrather bard on the young men who are\nwanting wives to have to run up\nagainst such competition.\nThe St. Louis Globe-Pemoerat uses\nnearly a column to explain the true in\nwardness of the old adage, "Feed a\ncold, starve a fever." Here\'s a correct\nrendering you can paste in your hat:\n"If you feed a cold, you\'ll have to\nstarve a fever."\nNo New York Jury is going to allow\ntears to be brought to its eyes by de\nscriptions of persecuted and impecuni\nous railways who were compelled to\nuse their city account hooks for .fuel.\nAfter awhile it may be necessary to\nadd a gymnasium or training quarters\nto the executive offices for tbe benefit\nof cabinet members who feel the need\nof keeping in the pink of condition.\nMorocco acts as if she didn\'t know\nthat there is sure to be a large bill for\nservices rendered after tbe completion\nof the Franco-Spanish policing job.\nAmericans are rapidly returning from\nEurope.

Nowhere waa:\nthere applied to this subject that de-1\ntermlned ring of heart conviction usu-1\nally heard on the lips of Labor day !\norators. Tbe same day a meeting of\ntbe committee on arbitration at The\nHague peace conference adjourned\nwithout advancing one step.\nTurning to tbe fields on which the\nvoice of Mars was lifted up on Sept 2.\nthere is another story to tell. On Salis\nbury plain 20,000 English soldiers were\npitted agaiiift one another in mimic\nwarfare. In Berlin Emperor William\n11. reviewed the garrison in the pres\nence of delegations from foreign ar\nmies and, the news dispatches say,\ndisplayed remarkable satisfaction at\nthe bearing of the troops. Speaking\non tbe Moroccan situation in Paris,\nGeneral Brugerc, ex-commander of tbe\nFrench army, declared that France is\nconfronted with a ten year struggle\nand the sacrifice of thousands of sol\ndiers and hundreds of millions of treas\nure in her attempt to pacify the Moors.\nNo one doubts that France will go\nchead just the same or that the Eng\nlish and German troops will be rushed\nfrom the drill and parade grounds to;\ntlie field of battle at a moment\'s notice, j\nOn tbe other baud, tbe one who says\nthat arbitration shall become the es- j\ncape gap for human greed and pas- j\nslons is laughed at as a dreamer.\nAs berries fade from our tables mel\nons continue to stay there, and pretty\nsoon it will be grapes, which are tol\nerably good fodder.
