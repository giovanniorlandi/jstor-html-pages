We.believe that the people\nare capable of settling this question;\nand that they have a right to settle\nit. Therefore, wo favor the passage\nby the next legislature of a well\nconsidered iihd adequate oounly local\noption law. and\'alBn the, unhmliudnn\nto a vote of the people of an amendmeat\nto the constitution prohibiting\nthe said\' traffic.\nAnd hgaln.- We passed a law: rev\nlntlng to the" compensation ol shertrTs,\nprosecuting attorneys, county\nclerKa^ circuit clerks, etc. This iaw\nprovides that when Vthh emoiuin\'ents\nfrom\'these offices reach a certain\namount the remainder goes Into the\ncounty fuml and the support of the\ncounty government.
