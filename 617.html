These\nwill light the proposition bitterly.\nLaws, however, are made for the\nmany, at least in iheory, and should be\nmade for the many in fact, and a\nlaw prohibiting alien ownership, as an\neconomic proposition, would be of\nbeneht to the many. Lands held by\noutsiders as an investment are in the\ndead hand or mortmain. They are\nnever improved. Like much vacant\nproperly held in cities, they are held\nunlil a congestion of population\ncrowds in and develops surrounding\nor contignuous territory, and enhances\ntheir value. They are withheld from\nme. The price is pul beyond the\nreach of those who would clear them\nup and till them.\nAlien ownership abolished, prices\nwould go down, actual settlers would\ncome and purchase, develope and till,\nand values would go up. A decline\nin price would injure the pockets of\nthe few who are holding these lands\nfor speculative purposes. An in\ncrease in values resultant from the\ncultivation of the soil, would benefit\nall the people of the state. If (here is\nany virtue in the postulate, "the\ngreatest good to (he greatest number."\nihe choice should not be difficult (o\nmake. It resolves itself into a ques\ntion of confl.ct between the interest of\nthe n.any and the interest of (lie few.\nThe land question is becoming\nacute in Mississippi. Much of the\nlands of I hat state are held by out\nsiders, who are withholding them from\nuse against the day when the timber\non them will be more valuable, and\nihe lands themselves in grealer de\nmand lor ciillivaiion. Of late lands\nin cuiiivaiion have been purchased in\nlarge heels by outsiders, and at fdncy\nprices. The owners of these lands\nwere benefited, but the many will be\ninjured. Alien ownership means that\nthese lands will be cultivated .solely\n.. .\nSunday mnrn\'ng and eveninit.\nv sel nrii i 11:40 ii. m.

Mr.\nKnagg Yes, but It\'s too late now to\nsue the company for damages.\nThe splendid plant of the Okolona\nOil Company was partly burned last\nFriday morning. The Company in\ncurred a loss of some sixty thousand\ndollars which was partly covered by\ninsurance. The burned purl of the\nmill was confined to the brick struc\nture and included practically nil the\nheavy machinery belonging to the\nmill nrooer. The seed and hull\nwarehouses, the gin plant, and the I\nstorage rpoms .for the finished pro\nducts were saved, some in a damaged\ncondition. Very little of the oil, meal,\ncake and hulls on hand were lost.\nThese items were said to be worth\nseveral thousand dollars. Work will\nbegin on rebuilding as soon as the\ni .t\ninsurance is adjusted.\nThe fire originated in the engine\nroom and spread rapidly from that\npoint to the other compartments of\nthe building, until all that part of the\nbuilding occupied by the machinery\nwas consumed or more or less\ndamaged.\nOne part of the lire fighting crew\ndirected their efforts to save (he\nstorage rooms and to prevent the fire\nfrom spreading to the North, while\nthe other undertook to conhne the\nflames within the structure at the\nsouih and save the seed warehouse.\nIn thiiythey were successful to the\nextent that a portion of the building\nwas saved at that end as was the\nother at the other end.\nThe city crew experienced con\nsiderable difficulty in reaching the\nfire because of the bad condition of\nthe street. Their hose cart stuck in\ni ill . : .\nthe mud anu wwaiever eijiiipinem\nthey got to the fire had to be carried\nseveral hundred yards which neces\nsarially made them late in arriving on\nthe scene. It then look some little\ntime to assemble what had been\nbrought along and get ready for busi-\nmi t ! LJ\nness. When mis was accompnsneu\nit was only a short while until the\nblaze was under control.\nThis mill was a fine piece of pro\nperty and gave work to quite a crew\nof bands. The whole city is glad to\nknow that it will be rebuilt and ready\nfor business when the season opens\nnext fall,\nS. C. K. I. REDS AND\nBERKSHIRE HOGS.\nFebruary 23rd\n1 ft A - ft 4\nMrs. C, r.
