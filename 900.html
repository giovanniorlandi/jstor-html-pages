YORK PLATFORM.\nNEW\nVERY LITTLE HARMONY\nNew York Republican Counties For\nParker, Democratic Counties Oppos\ned to Instructions. Hearst Will\nCarry Some New England States.\nLincoln, Neb., Apr. 21. W. J. Bry\nan gave out an interview today in\nwhich he denied the report that he\nwould discuss the presidential possi\nbilities in his Chicago speech Satur\nday. The address will be devoted en\ntirely to the New York platform. He\nsays he has not declared for anybody\nfor president and will not do so at\nChicago.\nSpecial to The Record.\nNew York, Apr 21 The instruction\nfor Parker in New York forced by\nthe Hill-Belmont machine, represents\nonly three-tenths of the Democratic\nvotes of the state. Tammany and the\nDemocratic counties representing\nseven-tenths of the Democratic votes\nof the state protested against the in\nstmction. and refused to make the\nvote on instructions unanimous. There\nis much indignation throughout the\ncity and state. Connecticut is sure,\nand Hearst is certain to get four,\nperhaps all, of the New England\nstates. The New York plaform shows\nthe Belmont and trust influences. It\nis unsatisfactory to all Democrats\nand the laughing stock for the regular\nDemocrats. Nine of the counties that\nwere against the instruction gave at\nthe last election a Democratic plural\nity of eighty-three thousand, four\nhundred and forty-nine. The forty-six\ncounties for the instructions gave a\nRepublican plurality of ninety-four\nthousand, six hundred and forty\nthree. BETTER THAN EXPECTED.\nHearst Men in Conciliatory Attitude\nOlney Men Confident.\nBoston, Mass., Apr. 21. Before the\nDemocratic state convention to se\nlect delegates at large for the nation\nal convention at St. Louis assembled\ntoday ithere were indications of a\nmore harmonious session than the\nleaders had previously expected. The\nstate committee during the night de\ncided to waive the unit rule for the\nMassachusetts delegation. In conse\nquence of this the Hearst delegates\nappeared before the convention to\nbe in a conciliatory attitude, while\nthe Olney men expressed satisfaction\na,t the prospect of controlling the\nconvention.\no\nRECEIVER APPOINTED.\nThe Ideal Cash Register Company is\nOut of Cash.\nTrenton, N. J., Apr. 21. Vice Chan\ncellor Bergen today on the applica\ntion of R. Z. Pierce, a stockholder,\nappointed Armstrong Muleford temp\norary receiver for the Ideal Cash Re\ngister Co. Pierce says the concern is\nindebted to him to the extent of\n$150,000 and to another concern to\nthe extent of two hundred thousand.\no-\nSTORM IN UTAH.\nHalf Inch of Rain and Five Inches of\nSnow.\nSalt Lake, U., Apr. 21. Delayed\ntrains and demoralized street car,\ntelephone and telegraph service resul\nted from a storm which raged yester\nday and last night throughout the\ninter-mountain country. The storm in\nthe vicinity of Salt Lake was the se\nverest April storm for , years. About\na half inch of rain fell and five inches\nof snow. Scores of trees were up\nrooted by the wind and hundreds of\nothers torn to pieces. Flood condi\ntions prevail in the lower part of the\ncity (today.\n\'i\' o\n-; A MATCH GAME.\nCarlsbad\'s Crack Team of Bowlers\nWill Arrive To-Morrow.\nA big time in the old town is ex\npected tomorrow night at the Colise\num Bowling Alleys. The crack Carls\nbad team will arrive here tomorrow\nmorning to play a match game with\nthe Roswell champions, Johnson\nMlnter and Hinds. Great preparations\narayeing made at the Coliseum for\nseating the visitors. An admission of\n25 cents will be charged for the men\nto help defray the expenses of the\nvisiting team. There will not be a\ncent charged for admission for the\nladies, and bless their hearts, every\nlady in the city is welcomed to the\ncontest. It is needless to say that\na large number of ladies of the city\nwill be present. The Carlsbad base\nball team will accompany the bowl\ners and a big time is anticipated.\nFriday will be a gala day in the old\ntown. Let\'s all join together to make\nthe festivities a success. Joe F. Page\nowner of the alleys, received the fol\nlowing telegram from Carlsbad today:\n"Bowlers will come Friday with the\nbaseball team."\nDistilled Water.\n"The Complete Practical Bottler"\nby Charles Herman, has this to say\non distilled water: "Distilling the\nwater is without doubt the most per\nfect plan for getting rid of organic\nmatter, but it unfortunately, separ-\naees the water from other bodies that\nare beter left in it. In a paper read\nat a recent pharmaceutical meeting\nseveral chemists were of the opinion\nthat distilled water is frequently of\na musty unpleasant odor, vapid and\ndisagreeable to the taste and as like\nly may contain metallic impurities\nfrom the uncertain careless meth\nods of commercial manufacture.\n"Further its efiicieney is called in\nto question from the physiological\nfact that distilled water is difficult\nof digestion and not acceptable to\nirritable stomachs. Distilled water is\nnot fit for drinking. It is fiat and in\nsipid. To be palatable water should\ncontain a certain amount of carbonic\nacid gas and air and \'also an infini\ntesimal proportion of chemical salts,\nbut distilling separates it from those\nnecessary ingredients. If distilled wa\nter should be exposed to the atmos\npheric air it would take up oxygen\nagain, but at the same time be con\ntaminated by the germs and minute\ninorganic particles the air is invaria\nbly loaded with. And may I not add\nthat when we think of the many that\ncame here years ago and done so\nwell, drink spring and artesian wa\nter, and the number that come here\nnow and are soon sent back corpses\n.Are not these thoughts worth con\nsidering. A gentleman told me the\nother day that he had watched, and\nthe ones who came here and drank\nartesian water do much better than\nthe ones who drink distilled water.\nIt may yet be shown that the Pecos\nValley waters have as much to do\nwith restoring health as the climate\nhas.

Whiteman. adjutant general\nof New Mexico, left last evening for\nSanta Fe, after an official visit here\nto inspect the New Mexico Military\nInstitute.\no\nDon\'t fail to see White Oaks when\nat the fair grounds tomorrow after\nnoon.

Riot Call\nTurned in and Police Respond to it.\nBerlin, Apr. 21. A correspondent\nof the Franfurter Zeitung writing\nfrom Harbin, Manchuria under date\nof March 16, says that great bitter\nness has been aroused throughout\nManchuria against the Americans\nand British because it is believed\nthat American and British vessels\ntook part in the bombardment of\nPort Arthur under the Japanese flag.\nThis belief apparently is due to the\nfact that the Japanese fleet was larg\ner than the Russians anticipated,\nand included unknown types of ves\nsels. The feeling is so strong that\nAmericans, and British are not safe\nin Manchuria. An American named\nBailey and several others including a\nCanadian by the name of Davidson\nhave disappeared. The authorities\nare looking for them. It is reported\nthai an Englishman was arrested at\nPort Arthur and hanged as a spy.\nPort Arthur. Apr. 21. A large\nlaunch from the Petropavlovsk was\nbrought into this harbor today. The\ncruiser Bayan suffered no damage\nfrom ithe hail of shells poured upon\nher from the Japanese war ships.\nThe Bayan went to the assistance\nof the Russian torpedo boat destroy\ners April 13th, just previous to the\nsinking of the Petropavlovsk. She\nwas subjected to the fire of five or\nsix Japanese cruisers, but escaped\nunhurt.\nTien Tsin, Apr. 21. Two Japanese\nofficers who were captured in Man-\ndhuria disguised as Lamas and who\nhad a large quantity of explosives\nin their possession have been taken\nto Port Arthur. An examination is\nbeing made to ascertain how they ob\ntained Chinese passports. They will\nbe dealt with according to martial\nlaw.\nSeoul, Apr. 21. The latest advices\ndo not confirm the report of occupa\ntion by Russian troops of Peyk\nChyong, a town about 70 miles down\nthe river from Sung Jin on east coast\nof Corea.\nTien Tsin. Apr. 21. The Russians\nhere believe that Viceroy AlexiefT\'s\nresignation will not be accepted.\nDenver, Colo., Apr. 21. When the\ntrain arrived this morning bearing\nPresident Moyer and his guard to\nattend the habeas corpus proceedings\nin the supreme court, a number of\npeople were at the depot. Among\nthem was Secretary Haywood of the\nFederation of Miners. Haywood en\ntered the car and shook hands with\nMoyer. Immediately Captain Bulkely\nWells jumped on him and Haywood\nknocked him down. Two soldiers slug\nged Haywood, knocking him under a\nseat and arrested him. He was taken\nwith Moyer to the Oxford hotel and\nthere trouble was renewed. Haywood\nknocked down two soldiers, and then\nother troopers bayoneted him and\nclubbed him into insensibility with\nthe butts of muskets. Haywood is\nbadly hurt. A riot call was turned\nin, but when the police arrived, the\nmilitia refused to surrender Hay\nwood, and they are still holding him.\nHaywood later recovered conscious\nness and Is now in the bands of a\ndoctor. The militia claim they have\na warrant for his arrest on the\ncharge of desecrating the flag. Chief\nof Police Armstrong has not made a\ndemand for the custody of Haywood\nwho Is constructively under arrest in\nDenver on the same charge.\nThere is a dispute as to whostruck\nthe first blow. According to the mili\ntary, Hayward tried to speak to Moy\ner and he was informed that he could\nnot talk to the prisoner. Then Hay\nward turned and struck Wells and\nthe fight followed. Hayward\'s worRt\ninjuries are a deep cut on the left\nside of the head and on the right\nside of the head. The surgeon was\nforced to take a number of stitches\nin the wounds. General Bell says he\nwill take Hayward as a military pris\noner to Telluride unless the supreme\ncourt decides against the governor\'s\nposition.\no\nWashington Notes.\nWashington, Apr. 21.

Roswell may then expect a\nlarge number of horses to be winter\ned here next winter, and the citizens\nshould do everything in their power\nto encourage trainers and owners to\ncome here, as it means the expendi\nture of a great deal of money among\nthe merchants and hotels of the ci\nty. Tomorrow will be the first oppor\ntunity for the people of Roswell to\nsee what our climate will do for race\nhorses wintered here. J. W.

True merit has\nelevated this famous remedy to that\'\nposition wherein It stands preeminently\nas the world\'s recognized cure for all\ndisorders of the stomach and diges\ntive organs.\nUnlike all other remedies.\nKodol combines the natural dl\ngestants with the greatest known\ntonic and reconstructive prop\nerties. It does not purge the\nsystem. The weak should\nnever be weakened and the\nsick should never be sick\nened. Such treatment\ngives temporary relief\noften, but permanent good\nnever.\nImmediate benefits\nfollow the first dose,\nand perfect health Is\nthe permanent result\nA\nLAWYER\nFive years ago\ndyspepsia took\nsuch a hold on\nme I could scarce\nly go. I took quan\ntities of medicines,\nbut nothing helped me.\nI tried Kodol, and im\nproved at once. It cured\nme. George S. Marsh,\nNocona, Tex\nA BANKER I suffered for\nfour years with indigestion. After\nhaving almost despaired of ever\ngetting well, Kodol was recom\nmended to me, I began to improve at\nonce. I am now taking the third bottle\nand I feel as well as I ever did. Can eat\nanything without bad effects.\nThos. H. Taylor, Como, Miss,\nA MERCHANT 1 suffered heart -burn\nand stomach trouble, caused by dyspepsia, have\nhad some very bad attacks of same. My sister-in-\nlaw has had the same trouble. She lived entirely on\nwarm water. Two bottles of Kodol cured her. As for\nmyself, I am glad to say that a dose of Kodol always\ngives ma instant relief. J. D. Erskine, Allenville, Mich.\nA MINISTER For years I suffered from dyipepsla.\ngrowing worse and worse, until culminating in a bad case of\nulceration of the stomach. Every known means, and many of\nthe best physicians, were consulted. My people sent me to\nEurope. Each Hemorrhage left me weaker and weaker. Finally\nI was induced to try Kodol Dyspepsia Cure. It relieved me beyond\nimagination. I am now using my third bottle, am preacning twice\nevery Sunday, and thank Cod I expect to be well soon.\nW. P. Lofer, Earlville. la.\nA DOCTOR After three years almost constant use of Kodol in\nhundreds of cases referable to faulty digestion and assimilation. I\ncan truthfully say it is the most efficient combination lor dyspep\nsia, indigestion, flatulence, nausea and all gastric disorders that\nIt has been my good fortune to discover. My experience in a\npeneral and hospital practice dates from 1872, and of all the\ndigestants prescribed in those thirty years, none in my hands have proved so\nthoroughly effective as Kodol. E. H.
