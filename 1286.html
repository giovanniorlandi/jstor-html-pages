It was originally planned that.\nKlamath Falls would meet the party at the lake and con\nduct them to Klamath Falls, but the Klamath Chamber of\nCommerce has withdrawn its invitation, hehee the ex\ncursionists will be taken to the lake ahd back as guests\nof the Rogue River valley ahd Medford Commercial club.\nAt the lake the party will be entertained by the OrateV\nLake conipany at the new inn, which will be "dedicated at\nthis date.\nThe progressive spirit and good citizenship of the\nvalley is appealed to by the Commercial club to furnish\nautos and drivel\'s to take these distinguished men to the\nlake and back with their auto and signify their intention to\ndo so to the club manager or members of the committee\nof entertainment. Twenty-live or thirty automobiles\nare required for the trip, and as many linguists to talk to\nme loreigners as possioie.\nArriving here early in\nwill be given a rule around the orchard section, then start\nat once for the lake. Lunch will be served on the banks\nof the Rogue at Prospect.\n, By means of this excursion, Crater Lake and the\nRogUe River valley will receive world-wide publicity\nand advertising oX inestimable value. Everv European\nand American university will ring with the praises of\nCrater Lake and every scientific body will hear it dis\ncussed. No possible amount of money spent could so\nattract attention to this sectioh and itsresources.\nThe exclusion is composed of presidents, vice-presidents\nand secretaries of the royal geographical societies\nof Europe, professors of geography, economic and physi\ncal, of climatology, oceangraphy, hydrography, maritime\nmeteorology, and cartography of the most famous Euro\npean universities, members of royal and national com\nmissions and leaders in a half a dozen Antarctic and other\ngeographic expeditions, accompanied by members of the\nAmerican society and of the national\' scientific bureau\nof Washington, D.

The exclusion will probably number 100\npersons.\nThe public spirited citizens of Medford, Ashland and\nthe Rogue River valley generally, are appealed to, to fur\nnish automobiles for the exclusion.

McCluro\nThe way bill Is tho original entry\nand key to the \'entire system of all\nexpress accounts. It is a cumber\nsome and imperfect form that is cop\nied over and over again for every\nrecord and statement, and the cler\nical work required by these repltlon\nentries paralyzo the business at holi\nday times when every person be\ncomes a patron and tho clerical work\nexceeds tho capacity and endurance\nof every offico force.\nAH express companies give a re\nceipt lo tho shipper, (1) way\nbill tho article, (2) enter the way\nbills on a transfer book snowing the\ntrain and messenger carrying the\nwaybills, 3) all messengers enter the\nwaybills on transfer books to ac\ncounts for their disposition, (4) de\nlivery drflces copy the waybills on\ndelivery sheets, and (5) copy all un\ndelivered articles on on hand sheets,\nshipping offices (C) copy all way\nbills on an abstract to tho auditor\nto account for tho charges and the\ndelivery offices (7) copy tho same\nwaybills on a statement to tho audi\ntor to account for tho charges; and\nthe auditing department, (8, etc.)\ncopy the waybills, and pro-rate the\ncharges, over and over again for\nevery account affected by tho charges\non each waybill.\nAll these repetition entries can\nbe eliminated by a perfect form of\nway bill, size 5 x 3 or 5 x C inches\nto bo filed In vertical files for every\nrecord without any clerical labor,\nwhatever, in copying. Four carbon\ncopies will be made at ono writing,\nono for receipt to shipper, ono for\nshipping offico copy, ono copy for re\nceipt for delivery to bo filed for de\nlivery offico record, and ono copy to\naccompany statement from delivery\noffico to tho auditor.

A complete\nnumerical system would designate\noffices, stores or individuals, making\nwaybills. Books of waybills would\nbo furnished to stores and Individ\nuals and deposits required to cover\nprepaid charges picked up by driv\ners.

The Postal Express voiild deliver\nall articles, by such asstem, with a\nregular periodic service over all ter\nritories with a fraction of tho ex\npense which tho many hundred du\nplications of tho delivery service\nnow require; rates would be reduced\nto a bagatello compared to present\ntariff rates. Every houso could be\nserved direct from tho farm, with\neverything ripe and fresh, with an\nabsolutely dependable service, which\nwould Incrcaso tho volume of ex\npress to a perpetual holiday busi\nness; but tho automobile will fur\nnish tho ideal vehicle to handlo an\nunlimited traffic, without getting\ntired, and the greater the volurno of\ntho business tho cheaper will be tho\ncost of handling It.\nSTATE SCHOOL FUND IS\nAPPORTIONED BY TREASURER\nI Mil . .1 111 0\nJackson county for tho coming\nschool yoar has been apportioned\n$1CB,6C0.C0 by tho stato treasurer,\nout of tho school fund, which will ho\nrepaid at six per cent Interest, with\nsufficient security.
