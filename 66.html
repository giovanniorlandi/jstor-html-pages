The bill was "Fanchon,\nthe Cricket," and while the company\ncould have selected something that\nwould probably have impressed the au\ndience more, the various members of\nthe cast appeared to good advantage\nand showed themselves capable of hand\nling the part-a very clever company\nfor a popular priced attraction. Of\ncourse it is not a dollar show, but as a\npopular priced attraction, the company\nis good and is even better than some\nshows that have showed in EI Paso and\ncharged $1. Vina Noble as "The\nCricket" was very clever in her work\nlast evening.\nAt Home or Abroad.\nTheodore Roosevelt is president of\nthe American people, not of any partic\nular political faction, and wherever he\ngoes or visita he should receive that true\nand royal welcome which is characteris\ntic of the American people.\n...i. n i...: ..I\nLong Range Forecasts. I Hester\'s Revenge.\nProbably in rm way has applied science j It would be hard to improve uMn\nbeen of more benefit directly to the ( Mester\'scoffee, and the rest of horcook\nworld than in evolving the system of j ing was in keeping; but it was quite\nweather forecasting now in use by the ; within the limits of possibility, at least.\nWeather Bureau. There is hardly any I to imagine improvement in her temper,\nbranch of industry that is not more or When angered, her old black face would\nless affected by the weather, but to the ; work frightfully, she slammed the cook\nagriculturist the mariner, or the ship- ing utensils down with shocking cmpha-\nper of perishable produce, information\nof coming weather changes is of vital\nimport. One Weather Bureau warning\nof a flood, colli wave; or a hurricane,\nhas been known to save property the\nactual value of which was many times\ngreater than the cost of the Bureau for\nan entire year. As the great work of\nthe Weather Bureau has grown, and\nthe demand for its daily forecasts in\ncreased, a host of so-called long range\nforecasters have risen who pretend they\ncan foretell the weather weeks, months,\nand even years in advance. These\nlong range prophecies are utterly worth\nless, and those who make them know\ntheir vaporings are based on no phys\nical law or scientific reasoning. It is to\nbe deplored that such statements, which\nare, at times positively harmful to the\npublic interests, are printed in some\npublications ami given circulation.\nThe Weather Bureau was organized\nfor the specific purpose of furnishing to\nthe people forecasts of the weather from\n"1 to -M hours in advance.\nA reasonably accurate forecast of the\nweather 21 to tS in advance is of real\nvalue; a blind guess for a week, a\nmonth, or a year in advance, is worth\nless. Should the time ever come when it\nis possible to make long range or sea\nsonal forecasts, with sutlieent accuracy\nto malee then of practical value, the\npublic can rest assured .hat the Weath\ner Bureau will utilize any reputable\nmeans that will m.-reasc its value to the\ngreat public interests it is endeavoring\nto serve.\nJudje Baiter temoved.\nThe President has removed \'Judge\nBaker, and the vacancy has been filled\nbv Justice lr. A. Abbot from Haver\nhill Mass.\nNumerous complaints h:d been filed\nagainst th" Judge in the department of\njustice, ai d it appeared that the poli\ntical and oilkial aluirs in Bernalillo\ncounty are in had eoi.dition, li.it im\nproper jury commissioners were being\nappointed, t bat the select ion f jurors\nhas been tampered with, that Sunday\nlaws are not enforced against gambling\nand saloons, and that Judge Baker was\nnot doing what a judge should to rem\nedy these evils. It wasconsi icred that\na more vigorous and strict judge was\nimperatively needed in his place. It\nwas for these reasons, that the change\nof judgeship was concluded upon and\nnot because Judge Baker was deemed\ndishonest or corrupt.\nLarger Appropratiom.\nThere are over 1 l.inci.OOO acres of\nland in New Mexico which have not\nbeen surveyed and platted. Last year\nsurveys of .\'." 1,1 IS aTcs were accepted\nby the Interior Department. At that\nrate it will take forty years to complete\nthe job. New Mexico recieved last\nfor official surveys, while Arizona re-$l.-.00O,\nUtah $15,000, Wyoming ?:W.\n000. Idaho $:V2.000, Montana $13.(HK) and\nAlaska $,\'i\'),X)0. An effort should be\nmade to have the annual ap r ipriations\nfor surveying in New Mexico increased\nso that it at least equals that of Arizona\nand that there may lie some likelihood\nof the work being completed within an\nother generation.\nDenver officials connected with the\nlast election are having a hard time in\nthe Colorado courts. For tampering\nwith the returns, and for ballot box\nstuffing, many of them are sentenced to\nheavy fines and imprisonment, and the\nend is not yet. A dishonest election\ncount is fully as atrocious as a train\nrobbery, and deserves a penalty equally\nsevere.\nIt is claimed by the people of El Paso\nthat the St. Louis Exposition took one\nmillion dollars out of thnt city. But\nthere is this remuneration, the El Pas\noans saw the big show.\nOver 400 horses, we are told, have\nbeen eaten by the Port Arthur garrison.\nThe Missouri mule was wise in keeping\nout of this war.\nsis, and went about meditating revenge\nupon the exciting cause of her wrath.\nBut she always did meditate.and the\ndelay thus involved, coupled with her\nsincere religious convictions that for\nbade her to injure others, was often the\nsalvation of those who annoyed her.\nTwo small and very troublesome boys\nwho lived across the street weft; fre\nquently the cause of Hester\'s indigna\ntion.\nOne day her mistress found her clat\ntering terrifically among the stewpans,\nher countenance such Os to strike ter.\nror to the heart of the beholder.\n"It\'s them boy, mis\'uhle boys, miss!"\nshe said, in reply to a question. \'I jes\'\nwent down street, miss . to the drug\nsto\' git a box o\' liver pill. They saw\nm.) go, and they clum up a tree; and\nwhen I was coming back with the pills,\nthey jes\' laid for me, calling mu names!\n1 am t gum to peal tia m names,\nmiss. They ain\'t futen f\'eraladv!"\nlleste\'r face became more terrible than\never. "I was that mad 1 jes\' run in the\nhouse an\'-an\' " Her mistress did not I\nthen know Hester as she has since come\nto know her. Wrought up by her dra-1\nmatic manner, divided between hop,\'!\nthat the insolent hoys had come to some !\njust reward and fear lest Hester had\nbeen carried away by her wrath, she i\ndemanded to know what she had done.\n"vVha\'d I do? I come cr\'ong in the\nh iiine, miss, an\' I jes\' nachelly th\'owcd\nthem liver pills in the stove" Youth\'s\nCompanion.\nThe Simple and Silly Life.\nAn Arizona, ch-i-gyrr:-.;; from King\nman, Ariz., is reported to be in New\nY V.i tri.ig to form i .dony to lead\nthe simple life. They are to live rent\nfree in clilf houses in a climate so\nwarm and dry that the bill for clothing\nI will amount to practically nothing.\nThey are to raise fnr.ts and vegetables,\ntend flocks and herds and live "close to\nnature." It is announced that no less I\nthan l.UtKl families from the dominion\nof Canada alone have agreed to try the 1\nsimple life. The grand round up and\nstart is to be made in the spring.\nWe Shall See. !\nIt is intimated by some of the leading\njournals that opposed Mr. Roosevelt\'s\nelection, that his apparent hostility to\nthe trusts was only for political clfect,\nan. I being now sure oi ins mgn position\nfor the next four years, he will cease\nto show any further opposition to the\nso called trusts, and, they will continue\nto exist ami plunder the people unmo\nlested by the executixe department of\nthe government. It begins to be ap\nparent to the doubters that the Presi\ndent will do Ins utmost to curb l In\ntrusts, and he "does iiiings."\nWe notice in our exchanges that both\nSanta Fe and Albuquerque are after\nour Fraternity Sanitarium. We have\na prior claim to that great institution;!\nit has been given a deed of a section -\nof land near town; and the manager\ncan have a thousand acres more, at j\ntheir own price, or as goou iarming\nland as there is in New Mexico; and the\nwater-well, for purity, Deming water I\nhas a national reputation. j\nAlmost every day adds to the stran-!\ngers on our streets looking for rooms j\nor small residences for light housekeep\ning. To escape the long and dreary \'\neastern and northern winters, they j\nhave come to enjoy our cloudless days, \'\nto admire the matchless dory of our 1\nsunsets, and recuperate their mortal\nenergies in this southern New Mexico\nwinter climate. "Come one come all,"\nthere\'s plenty of room for you.\nIf there was a premiun offered by the\nSt. Louis Exposition for the most spicy\nand entertaining newspaper correspond\nent, "J. C.

He was on his\nway to Douglas, and had with him one\nfine specimen of Black Hawk horse\nflesh, that he is taking overland to the\ngreat mining camp of Arizona.\nI\nAnother Fire.\nA fire was discovered in Mr. J. A.\nKieth\'s drug store about six o\'clock\nlast Sunday morning. The alarm was\ngiven, the firemen were promptly at\nthe burning buüdi g, and the fr-, which\nwas inside and in the rear of the store,\nwas soon extinguished; but not until\ngreat damage had been done to the ex\ntensive stock, which in addition to the\nregular line, consisted of a larg and\nexpensive line of holiday goods. The\ndamage was mostly caused by smoke\nwhich ruined much and damaged more\nof the entire stock.\nMr. Keith has only recently embarked\nin the business, und the loss of his\ngoods, and his holiday trad" which was\nopening so auspiciously, is a heavy blow\nfrom which it will take a long time to\nrecover. We deeply sympathize with\nMr, Keith in his misfortune.\nMendoza Killed.\nList u lay night three Mexicans filled\nUp with v. hiskey mil brandy, and aooiil\n11 I\'.

Sangre, Editor and Manager.\nScored A Victory.\nAs to the result of the fight\nagainst corruption in Dernalillo\ncounty the Albuquerque Morn\ning Journal says:\nWithout any inclination to\nboast fulness, but merely as a\nmatter of history, we would call\nattention to the fact that in\nMarch. 1903. just twenty-one\nmonths ago. the Journal, "soli\ntary and alone," took up the bat\ntle for decent government in\nBernalillo county. We were\ncommiserated by scores of good\nfriends uion the sad fate which\nwe were inviting upon ourselves,\nand while their sentiments in the\nmatter were the same as our own\nthey warned us that we were\ntaking the high road to ruin.\nWe were told that it could never\nbe done, the boss was too strong,\nhe was supreme in the city and\ncounty, and bestrode the terri\ntory like a colossus; the most\n"prominent citizens" were ready\nand anxious to do his bidding,\nand his word was law with the\nlegislature. The common warn\ning was, "You can\'t do it, and\nyou are simply butting your head\nagainst a stone wall to try."\nWe confess that it did l\'.k\nvery much that way, and a great\ndeal of our experience point;-.!\nunnloasantly toward stone walls.\nbut we never lost faith in (od cv\nthe people, and wlu-n the !\nGovernment league was o:\nized. and an abb and lV;i.
