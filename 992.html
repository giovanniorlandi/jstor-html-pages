This is not an\norganisation league as Is the Turn\nverein Cocked Hat League, but an\nopen bowling association represented\nin Houston by tha tenpln plsyers of\nthe Houston Turnrerein.\nTwo Houston men are the officials\nof the league. V. E. Ritchie Is presi\ndent and W. I. Ligbtbouae. secretary.\nThe fir Texas cltlea at present\ncomposing the league are Houston.\nBryan. LaGrange. Victoria and Gal\nveston. Brenham is the real home\nof the Turnrerein tenpln movement\nas the star teams of the city have\nbeen noted for a good many years.\nThe formation of the state league\ngrew out of the competitions between\nBrenham and other Texaa cities.\nThe first annual tournament of the\nTenpln League waa held last year In\nBrenham on Feb. 22. with but three\nteams contesting, these representing\nHouston. Brenbam and LaGrange. The\nresult waa a clean aweep for llrenham\nIn every class of competition.\nC. V. Lemtn of Brenham Germanla\nwon the number on singles and T. B.\nBotts of tha same club the number\ntwo singles. The doubles also regis\ntered a clean victory for the Germanla\nteams of Brenham, W. Ehlert and Ed\nSchmidt taking the honors in number\non and W. E. Bernd and F. L. Ama-\nler In number two.\nBrenham Germanla led the number\njono team, ana aiso tne number two.\nIn every competition Houston Turn-\nvereln ran second.\nWith th Increase In Interest In\nHouston and elsewhere and the enter\nIng of three more teams, the competi\ntion this year Is expected to be much\ncloser than In 1915 and the local bowl\nera look forward to wresting the\nhonors from the famous Germanla\nteams. Tha aama Idea seems to pre\nvail In Victoria. LaGrange and Gal\nveston, however, while at Brenham,\ngermanla Is confident of another\n. aeries of victories.\nI Tha coming state tournsment will\nI be conducted on the local Turnverein\nalleys, which have recently been en\nlarged to the point where they can\neasily accommodate the big crowd.\nThere are now four tenpln alleys In\nstead of two, and the two old ones\nhave been remodeled until they are\naecond to none In the Southwest.\nThe bowling will be under the na\ntional rules, and competition In sin\ngles, doubles and team play, thirty\nframea each, will take place.\nMost of Sunday will be devoted to\npreliminary bowling, while on Monday\nthe big eventa are to take place.\nOn Sunday, the annual meeting of\nthe association will be held at the\nTurnverein. Any necessary changes\nIn constitution and by laws will be\nmade then, and officers for the ensu\ning yesr elected.
