The average\nperiod of Invalidism will be more than\na month for every case developing, so\nthat the economic loss, even If re\ncovery does ensue, ran be reckoned\nupon this basis. Including at the same\ntime the rare and attention required.\nOf those who contract the disease,\npossibly 1S.000 will auciumb. Fifty\nper cent of these will be between the\nages of IS and 25 years, the very time\nof life whtn the loss is most frightful.\nMoreover, this Is an annual toll and\nrepresents the minimum fatality\nwhich we have attained. No sooner\nla the computation of the lS.Ooo com\npleted than another aeries Is begun.\nand so interminably. True, there Is\nsome diminution In the total number.\nthe death rate since 19o0 having been\ndiminished by halt, and most of our\ncities showing a progressive reduction\nIn the Incidence of the disease, but it\nfctill remains much higher than that\nof countries which we are apt to con\naider less civilized than our own.\nTyphoid Time Coming.\nAnother typhoid season Is again at\nhand. With the advent of aummer\nweather, the presence of flies, con\ntamination of food product a, and the\nincreased liability of Infection through\nchanges of residence, It once more Is\nnecessary for health bodies to sound\na warning note. This Is becoming an\nannual tustol.i and doubtless will\nsoon lie considered one of the early\nprognostications of the onset of the\nsummer season, but the health officer\nshould not modify his tones on this\naccount, lie is Indeed a prophet and\n7v f- \'i rrur-\n"v. -AV\nJ I A V\nsl J\nnil\n1\nka\ni ssass .\nV 1\ndelicious ?3\nrcfrcslurA - tal\n-- a\n7 .
