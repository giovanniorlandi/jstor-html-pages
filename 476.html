Mr.\nJarrett said that while the resolution\nmight not meet the technical re\nquirements of lawyers, it represent\ned the sentiments of those who wish\ned to see it passed, and would serve\nthe purpose of allowing the citizens\nof Palatka to go to the polls and\nregister their choice bn a change of\ngovernment. Alderman Johnson sug\ngested that the matter be\' taken up\nat a special meeting of council to\nnight, and on motion council went on\nrecord as favoring the passage of\nthe proper resolution.

He did not know\nat the time that council has no such\nauthority and that the people would\nprobably vote down any proposal\nwhere the regular democratic form\nof legislating is deviated from.

There\nwill be some changes, undoubtedly,\nbut it is figured that all inequalities\ncan be eliminated as well or better at\na full valuation than on a 50 per cent\nbasis.\nThe new valuation will yield $61,\n889.55 on a nine-mill assessment,\nagainst $57,446.40 on a 20-mill as\nsessment on the old roll, so that the\nactual amount that taxpayers will\nturn into the city treasury under the\nnew plan will be but slightly larger\nthan that of las tyear, and will take\ncare of the city\'s needs.\nOne of the greatest advantages of\nthe new system of assessment is the\nshowing that is made- to strangers,\nand will give the city greater bor\nrowing power for improvements.\nMuch of the increase is due to the\nannexation of the Heights, this be\ning itemized in the assessor\'s report\nas follows:\nCity real estate $4,173,610\n\'City personal 1,859,450\nCorporations - . 536,564\nHeights realty 203.020\nHeights personal 82,800\nCorporation Heights ... 21,140\nKEMAL PASHA\nTO DEMAND A\nFULLCOMPACT\nMay Demand Abroga\ntion of Treaty Made\nWith Soviets .\nKemalfets Are Opposed\nto a Turko-Russo\nAlliance\nTotal . . $6,876,584\nAt council meeting last night it\nwas pointed out that the next legis\nlature will be asked to limit the num\nber of mills which a council can\nsess to 10, but it is not believed that\n10 mills will be required to finance\nthe city, especially under a commis\nsion form of government.\nANXIETY ENTERTAINED FOR\nWHEREABOUTS TOW LAWSON\nBoston, Oct. 4.

It is now announced by actuaries\nof the treasury that the duties im\nposed on agricultural products will\nbe inoperative a\'s a means of produc\ning revenue because of an absence of\nimports of the commodities they\ncover. They will be equally fruitless\nin giving protection to American pro\nducers who have to sell their surplus\nof grain abroad where no American\ntariff can avail to afford markets or\nincrease prices.\nSenator Cameron exposed in his\nspeech in the senate the trick by\nwhich tne eastern republican reac\ntionaries used the tariff on agricul\ntural products as a bait to get the\nvotes of western senators. His par\nticular grievance was the withdrawal\nof the duty originally leveid in, the\nbill on long staple cotton, in which\nArizona has a big investment and in\ncreasing interest. The picture Sen\nator Cameron drew of the way in\nwhich the Arizona cotton \' growers\nwere betrayed and flouted by the\neastern republican reactionaries is a\nnew light on the workings of the\nclique by whom and for whom the\nFordney-McCumber bill was really\nwritten.\n"The story is easy to tell," Senator\nCameron said. "The great tire man\nufacturers and spinners, all interests\nusing the raw material (long staple\ncotton), who were already rolling in\nwar profits, not content with the tar\niff protectio nprovided for their fin\nished products, organized in the old\nfashioned way, turned loose their\nmoney; spread misleading, unfair\nand malicious propaganda; sent rep\nresentatives to Washington, among\nthem an ex-member of this body, who\nbuttonholed the managers of this\nproposition into a recession of this\ntariff rate and thereby with the wink\nof an eye, and for no good reason,\nsmashed this great industry and\nwiped out the chances of the people\nlor an honest living m producing a\nneeded commodity."\nu is noteworthy that the clemo-\ncharged the republicans with\nhese tactics as to other items\nill. but Senator Cameron\neply moved until his own\nlearn and much to profit by, through j\na more intimate acquaintanceship\nwith our neighbors. There is a rea-j\nson for this present condition of\naloofness; that reason is the lack of\ncommunication. You ask: "How\nabout the railroads?" One nttompt\nto travel west Florida or south Geor\ngia by rail will be enough to last a\nlifetime. Anyway you cannot see or\nknow the old south through that me\ndium; not a chance in the world to\nbecome really and truly acquainted.\nThe rails do not run in front of beau\ntiful estates nor do they seek out the\nbills and dales with their vistas -of\ngreen trees and sparkling lakes it is\nthe wide, well-surfaced sand-clay\nroads which lead you hither and\nthither through a country as appeal\ning and attractive as one could hope\nto find anywhere.\nMisunderstandings and misconcep\ntions are at the bottom of most of the\nunpleasant things in life whether it\nbe in matters of business, of politics,\nof society. This particularly is true\nof the situation existing today be\ntween the extreme sections of this\ngreat state. When certain state\nments and accusations are made by\nthe people of another part, those\nstatements are often based upon a\nlack of knowledge, of the facts as\nthey exist.\nAdmitting that the lack of famil\niarity, one section with another, is\ndue to inability to come into personal\ncontact, it is encouraging to note\nthat this barrier is rapidly being re\nmoved. The agency employed is a\ngood roads system. The missing\nlinks between west Florida and south\nFlorida are being filled in day by day\nand week by week as fast as men\nand money can be secured. Within\ntwo or three years the two sections\nwill be united by state highways that\nwill make possible that delightful\nand intimate acquaintanceship which\nalone can preserve to posterity the\nwonderful heritage which we call\nFlorida.\nThe occasion for these reflections\nis a recent visit to the old south, as\nrevealed in that glorious country be\ntween Thomasville, Monticello and\nTallahassee. Wide, smooth highways\nrun in all directions except to the\npeninsular portion of Florida, but\nthis emission is being made good by\nthe construction of state road No. 1\nwhich within a couple of years will\nbe hard surfaced all the way from\nJacksonville westward to Madison.\nThat road will open the door to Flor\nida and act as a feeder to every sec\ntion of the state.\nThat people residing in the upper\ntier of Florida counties and the coun\nties of southern Georgia are eager to\ntravel into south Florida, can best be\nattested by the frequent expression\nof the wish that there be provided a\nsurfaced highway down the state.\nThose folks want to see what we are\nand what we have just as badly as\nwe ought to want to see them and\nknow what fine people they are.\nThey have a right to this and so have\nwe, so why raise a rumpus about\nbuilding roads in Florida that will\nact as a common bond of friendship\nand brotherliness.\nThe day is not far distant when an\ninterchange of visits will be an easy\nmatter to accomplish a few hours\'\nThe Jewish mind sees, thinks and\nworks clearly.\nYoung ladies and old might write\non their tablets this piece of Jewish\nwisdom:\n"Cold water, morning and evening,\nis better than all the cosmetics."\nJews, like others, seek for fame,\nmoney, honor. But oeiore an tney\nput education. That is why they suc\n"If thou hast acquired knowledge,\nwhat canst thou lack? ,If thou lack\nest knowledge, what canst thou acquire?"\nOther Talmudic sayings on educa\ntion are:\n"Do not confine your children to\nyour own learning, for they were\nborn at another time."\n"Teach the children of \' the poor\nwithout compensation, and do not fa\nvor the children of the rich."\n"One who teaches a child is one\nwho writes on clean paper."\n"Honor the sons of the poor; it is\nthey who bring science into splen\ndor." .\n"Ignorance and conceit go hand in\nhand."\n"He who instructs a child is as if\nhe had created it."\n"Without knowledge there can be\nneither true morality nor piety."\n"I am a teacher of little children."\nThe Jews now enter upon the\no,683d year of their era. They will\nlive and work for thousands of years\nto come, because they value knowl\nedge, get knowledge and use knowl\nedge.

He\nis getting many applications for\nloans from people who wish to estab\nlish their own homes and believes\nthat now it has been shown that reg\nular dividends of 8 per cent may be\nexpected by depositors that many\nmore will avail themselves of the op\nportunity for saving presented by\nthe . association.

This\nmakes it impossible forthe commis\nsioners to lay the blame on any other\nofficer if things go wrong. If there\nis no one ho can hinder the commis\nsion in its work, the commissioner is\nrobbed of every possible excuse and\nis obliged to "face the music" in\ntimes of public criticism.\nUnification of powers is a basic\nmerit of the commission plan and\nmust not be departed from in the city\nmanager plan.\nIn a town or city of this size, there\nshould be not less than three or more\nthan five commissioners, elected at\nlarge, and subject\' to recall. They to\nselect from its members a chairman\ntvho fulfills the duties of mayor.\nThe manager to be appointed by\nthe commission, subject to release\nwithout notice at any time. The\nmanager to have the exclusive right\nof employment of all persons serving\nthe -city in any capacity, from and in\ncluding the heads of ail departments\ndown to the day laborers, subject to\ndismissal by the city manager at any\ntime without notice.\nThe commissioner being subject to\nrecall in case of malfeasance in of\nfice, or adoption of any policies not\nconcurred in by a majority of the\nelectors. They are subject to ouster\nfor misconduct in office. The man\nager being legally subject to the\nwill of the commissioners, must, re\nflect the character of the board. If\nthe board is weak, unless by acci\ndent or error they employ a strong\nmanager, , the government would be\nweak. If the board is strong, with\nintegrity and character, they will un-\ndiwbtedly employ a strong manager,\nor, if by error a weak one should be\nemployed," he is subject to immediate\ndismissal.\nThe practical workings of the commissioner-manager\nplan of municip\nal governments throughout the coun\ntry, appears to have been accepted\nby the public press and the majority\nof the cities who have tried it as be\ning the best.\nPalatka is being operated under\nthe most antiquated system. Being\ngoverned by eighteen aldermen, a\nmayor and other officers, which are\nelected by the council, under fifteen\nto twenty charter amendments. This\nsituation, obviously, needs remedy\ning, and much of Palatka\'s future\nprogress depends on the form and ef\nfectiveness of the new government.\nThe commission-manager form of\nmunicipal government is the appli\ncation of business methods to the op\neration of business methods to the\noperation of a city. Under this sys\ntem the elected commissioners are\nsimply a board of directors; they elo\nnot concern themselves with depart\nmental detail, as is the case under\nour re rv-tem. That function\nthey le.ve to a 1 appointive chief ex\nutive. who is linown as the city man\nger. 1 hi - v?t:eial is expected to oe\nIn expert and need not be a resident\nt the chy at t\'-e t i i" c of his appoint-ent.\nf In bet-.ih r.f This plan it is c\'aim-\ni--,t \'he eomm\'.ssion is a rryire\n\'\'XjA\' \' f,ody than is pos-\nJ : vcessary for\n\' r uinincr\nJu the nev\n. . oae\'o cost ?J0T J\nUniversal business practice demon\nstrates this, as does also the success\nof any large corporation, such as, the\nwuson cypress company, of our\ncity. All of its work is done through\na hired manager. It is important to\nthe plan that the city manager shall\nbe appointive. Any scheme which\nwould make him elective is fatal to\nthe principle.\nThe commission-manager form\' of\ngovernment fixes individual respon\nsibility and gives to the citizens the\npower to see that laws are enforced,\nbusiness matters are attended to, and\npromptly, through the power of the\nrecall. The people elect their com\nmissioners, in whom all powers are\nvested; over these commissioners\nthey have the power of recall. The\ncommissioners appoint a city man\nager, the city manager appoints all\nthe other officers, who, like himself,\nhold office during good behavior and\nproper performance of the duties of\nhis office. All appointive officers\nare responsible to and can be dis\ncharged by the city manager.\nThe city manager is responsible to\nthe commissioners and can be re\nmoved" for cause. The commission is\nresponsible to the people and can be\nrecalled for non-performance of the\nduties for which they were elected,\nand their successors elected and im\nmediately installed. Should any ap\npointive officer, marshal, clerk, col\nlector, assessor, treasurer, fail or re\nfuse to perform his duties, the city\nmanager discharges him and re\nplaces him with someone who will\nattend to the duties of the office.\nShould the city manager fail or re\nfuse to see that he performed his du\nties, the commission puts the man\nager on notice that the matter must\nbe corrected at once, or they will get\na manager who can and will properly\nattend to the business of the city;\nshould the commissioners fail or re\nfuse to remedy the condition, the\npeople say to them, if you cannot or\nwill not see that conditions are cor\nrected, we will "recall you and put\nothers i nyour place who will see\nthat the city is properly run. This\ncertainly fixes the responsibility and\nleaves \'the power for enforcing the\nperformance of duty in the hands of\nthe people.\'\nHundreds "Upon hundreds of towns\nand cities from Maine to California\nand from the Great Lakes to the gulf\nhave abolished the ol dform of coun\ncil government and are now operated\nunder the modem, up-ti-date business\nmethod commission-manager form.\nWhy canncf " and should not Palat\nka Joe one of the progressives and\nmake the change?\nA great many of our citizens are\nof the opinion that we, have to wait\nfor the legislature to meet in order\nto change our charter.. But such is\nnot the case.\nUnder the state law, every city and\ntown in the state, whether \' incorpo\nrated by a special act or under the\ngeneral laws of the state relating to\ncities and towns, shall have the pow\nLocal Moose Enjoy\nDedication of New\nHome Moosehaven\ner and authority to change its char\nter. Chapter 6940, "Laws of Florida,"\ndescribes specifically how (these\nchanges, modifications or amend\nments may be made by cities and\ntowns of the various classes, through\ncharter boards elected by the people.\nSection 3 of this chapter says:\n"Charter boards shall be composed\nof the following number of members:\nIn cities and towns having a popula\ntion of five thousand or less, five\nmembers; in cities having a popula\ntion of more than five thousand and\nnot more than twenty thousand, nine\nmembers; and in cities having a pop\nulatio of more than twenty thousand,\nfifteen members."\nPalatka, being a city of less than\nfive thousand, according to its last\ncensus, must elect five charter board\nmembers.\nThe voters of the city need not let\ntheir minds be occupied with but one\nquestion, viz.,- that of the personnel\nof this charter board. If you are in\nfavor of continuing our present al\ndermamc form of government, then\nvote for members of a charter board\nwho will see that no change of gov\nernment is had. Upon the other\nhand, if you think that a \'busk-.ess\nadministration,\'\' such as is being ad\nministered in thousands of our most\nprogressive cities, is better, then vote\nfor a charter board who is pledged\nto give us this change.\nKeep this one thought in mind,\nhowever, that even v.her, your char\nter board members have completed\ntheir work and have offered you a\nnew organic law. the power yet rests\nin the hands of the voters, as the\nwork of the board must be ratified\nby the voters in another election to\nbe held for this purpose.\nA large number of Palatka Moose\nattended the dedication exercises of\nMoosehaven at Orange Park yester\nday and report a splendid tiem.\nAmong the notable guests present\nwere Governor Carey Hardee and\nMayor John W.
