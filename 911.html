Hilgedick,\noperator at Minneapolis Junction,\n•truck by lightning.\nWaconia—August Moy, forty years\nold Mrs. August Moy, thirty-eight\nyears old Baby Moy, one year-old\nRobert Lohman, thirty-nine years old.\nSt. Louis Park—Albert Ohde, saloon\xad\nkeeper John Hedger, six years old\nAnna Hodge.\nThe damage to property is estimated\nat over $2,000,000, divided as follows:\nfit. Paul, $1,000,000 Minneapolis, $300,\n000 St. Louis Park, $76,000 Waconia,\n$75,000 Stillwater, $100,000 outside\ndistricts, $500,1)00.\nHigh Bridge Partially Destroyed.\nThe greatest single property loss at\nSt. Paul was the destruction of two\nspans of the high bridge, a burden\nwhich will fail upon the city at large.\nThe other. damage is distributed\namong thousands of residences and\nhundreds of business houses.\nThe storm confined its area mainly\nto the localities where fatalities are\nreported, although Stillwater reports\na loss of $100,000. In both St. Paul\nand Minneapolis the business districts\nsuffered severely, several wholesale\nhouses being unroofed and hundreds\nof plate glass windows being blown\nin, causing immense damage to stocks.\nIn the residence district of St. Paul,\nprincipally in Lower Town and Ar\xad\nlington Hills, many houses are com\xad\nplete wrecks and others are seriously\ndamaged.\nIn Minneapolis, considering the in\xad\ntensity of the storm, the residence dis\xad\ntricts of the city escaped with com\xad\nparatively slight damage. Although a\nfew structures were unroofed and the\ncontents of the buildings drenched\nwith water as a rule the people of\nthese districts suffered no great loss.\nAt Waconia, of the 100 houses, resi\xad\ndences and stores, seventy are more\nor less demolished and in the country\nlor a strip one-half mile in width ex\xad\ntending four miles along the Minne\xad\napolis and St. Louis tracks east and\nwest there is scarcely a building stand\ning.\nAt St. Louis Park nearly all of the\nlarge manufacturing establishments\nwere more or less wrecked "and houses\nwere razed to the ground. The heaviest\nloser is T. B. Walker, the Minneapolis\n.capitalist, who owns most of the twen\xad\nty houses which were overturned and\nsome of the manufacturing buildings.\nStorm Divides at 8t. Paul.\nThe scene of wreck and ruin in St.\n-Paul extends from the Minnesota\n^transfer through to the eastern limits\nof the city and no locality escaped\nwithout some damage. The storm, be\xad\nlieved to have been a genuine cyclone\nas it approached Fort Snelling from\nthe southwest, divided at the fort and,\nrushing onward in two main sections,\nmade a clean sweep of the city. The\nsection which caused the greatest\nwreck followed down the Mississippi\n"\'dose to the south bank, wrecking two\n100-foot spans of the high bridge, leav\xad\ning a trail of ruined trees and build\xad\nings on beautiful Harriet island, veer\xad\ning across to the north end of the\nWabasha street bridge and destroying\nthe Tivoll theater like a-cardhouse,\nkilling two, thence taking a course\n\'due northeast through the heart of the\nwholesale district and on through\nLower Town and out across Arlington\nHills to the city limits, where it\nVeered again and twenty minutes later\ncaused tremendous loss of property in\nBtillwater.\nThe second portion of the tornado\neloud followed the Minnesota river for\na short distance, then swetft down on\nthe Minnesota transfer, leveling two\nhuge grain elevators to the ground.\nI From that noint the .clouds seam to\nWILL NOT FACE THE JAP8.\n^Russian Warships at Shanghai to\ni.

The\ncrushed and bleeding form of Viola\nBobinson, twelve years of age, was\nrecovered by a squad of firemen with\xad\nin an hour On Summit avenue, more\nthan a mile due south, the storm at\nthe same instant swept the finest resi\xad\ndence street in America, demolishing\ntrees that are the work of a half cen\xad\ntury, tearing up beautiful lawns and\ncausing damage which it will take\nmonths to repair.\nThe tornado, during its course\nthrough the city, was marked by pro\xad\nnounced cyclonic Characteristics. There\nwas a tremendous suction in the wake\nof the winds, which caved in walls,\nbroke every sheet of glass in dozens of\nbuildings and carried away the roofs of\nmany more. There was the same\ncrashing impact of the tornado cloud,\nfollowed by a brief lull, and a second\nimpact, which was even more violent\nthan the first. There was the same\ncrashing rush, over within a few mo\xad\nments, revealing a work of ruin little\nshort of marvelous, considering the\ntime within which the destruction was\nwrought.\nSTORM IN WISCONSIN.\nLightning and Wind Causes Consider\nable Damage.\nHammond, Wis., Aug. 23.—At 9\no\'clock Saturday evening a severe wind\nstorm, accompanied by rain and hail,\nswept over this village.

Consider\xad\nable damage was done to crops in\nshock and stack and farm buildings\nwere demolished in many localities.\nMany farmhouses in the, vicinity of\nNorth Wisconsin Junction were swept\naway, the storm assuming the propor\xad\ntions of a tornado in that district.\nFOUR DEAD AT GLENCOE, MINN.\nTornado Did Great Damage to Grain\nand Property.\nGlencoe, Minn., Aug. 23.—A tornado\nstruck the township of Rich Valley\nand Bprgen Saturday night about 8\no\'clock, killing four people, Mary\nO\'Donnell, aged thirteen, daughter of\nPatrick O\'Dofihell the seven-year-old\ndaughter of Anthony O\'Donnell, Fred\xad\nerick GrosB and his mother.\nThousands of acres of grain and\nmany barns, houses and sheds were\ndestroyed. The most complete wrecks\nwere the houses, barns, granaries and\ngrain stacks of William Bayland, An\xad\nthony O\'Donnell and Herman Tekur.\nMany others sustained heavy losses.\nThe greatest damage was confined\nto a section ten miles long and a mile\nwide. The wind storm was followed\nby hail and a terrific rain lasting an\nhour or more.

Y., Aug. 23.—It was made\nplain at Rosemount during the day\nthat there is no certainty of Judge\nParker\' making any speeohes in the\nWest in connection with his St. Louis\ntrip or at any other time or place. The\nprinciple on which Judge Parker will\nact in the matter was learned from an\nintimate associate of the judge, who\nsaid:\n"Judge Parker has no faith in the\nutility of speechmaking for its own\nsake and will make no speeches any\xad\nwhere for the mere purpose of appear\xad\ning in any given locality. He believes\na stumping tour by a presidential can\xad\ndidate to be improper and he will un\xad\ndertake no such tour. The only condi\xad\ntion upon which he will make anv\nspeech anywhere will be the fact that\nhe has some definite thing to say and\nthat he is convinced by his own rea\xad\nson that some given time and place\nbest suits the saying of it there and\nthen. You may say with the utmost\nconfidence that under no other condi\xad\ntions will Judge Parker make any\nspeech anywh«ro\nChefoo, Aug. 23.—It is asserted In\nreliable quarters at Port Arthur that\nthe Japanese have receives reinforce\xad\nments of 30,000 men from the north.\nThe steamer Victoria, which arrived\nhere during the eveniig from New\nchwang, reports hearing spasmodically\nheavv firing at Louisa and.

Each squad\nhas a specific territory and each man\nhas a specific portion of a division. A\nlargely increased number of policemen\nwere assigned to the packinghouse\ndistrict by the chief of police.\nThe first person arrested by the po\xad\nlice was Thomas Stroker, business\nagent for the Meat Cutters\' union,\nwho was endeavoring, as a strike\npicket, to prevent nonunion men from\nentering the yards. He was charged\nwith disorderly conduct, notwithstand\xad\ning his\' protests that he was acting\nentirely within his constitutional\nrights.\nThe railway trains into the stock\nyards, usually crowded, were only\npartly filled, showing a great falling\noff in the number of strike breakers.\nThis is considered largely due to the\nshooting of Saturday night, when one\nman was killed and several others\nbadly wounded. It is estimated that\nfully 1,000 strike breakers who went\nout Saturday failed to return to work\nMonday, but there were a few new\nmen employed.\nFormer Judge Moran appeared be\xad\nfore Judge Brentano during the after\xad\nnoon and filed a bill for an- injunction\nrestraining the city of Chicago from in\xad\nterfering with the housing of strike\nbreakers in the stock yards. The bill\nis brought in the name of the G.

Oilman, in discussing\nthe case, spoke more encouragingly\nthan he has done for Beveral days. He\nsaid:\n"The senator is still very weak and\nin a critical condition, but I think he\nhas shown improvement in the last\ntwenty-four hours."\nThen the doctor added: "If he con\xad\ntinues to take nourishment I think we\ncan give a bulletin shortly that will\ncause the people of Worcester to be\nsatisfied that their favorite son may\nagain be seen on the floor of the sen\xad\nate."\nFour Men Horribly Burned.\nShamokln, Pa., Aug. 23.—In an ex\xad\nplosion of gas in a slope of the Buck\nRidge Coal company near here John\nBader, Lincoln Campbell, Harry When\nnon and Anthony Tolitski were hor\xad\nribly burned.

Their attacks\nwere made mostly at night, during\nfoggy days and misty mornings.\nThe Japanese believe that their su\xad\nperior physical conditio will win the\nbattle for them by the wearing of the\nRussian garrison, ^Jiich is constituted\nof less hardened material, down to the\npoint of exhaustion by the persistency\nof their attack and Iheir refusal to ac\xad\ncept a repulse.\nThe temperament of the Russian\ngarrison is dogged and determined.\nThe hospitals and Chinese houses at\nPort Arthur are full of Russian wound\xad\ned.

Local\npapers, giving pictures of some of the\nscenes of wreckage and desolation\ngive a more adequate idea of the fury\nof the storm. It has long been con\xad\ntended that this section of the north\xad\nwest was without the tornado belt, but\nit becomes more and more apparent\nthat few places, subject to sudden\nchanges of temperature, are immune\nfrom the dreaded tornado. Leaving\nthe scientific phases of the tornado to\nthe meteorologists and interesting our\xad\nselves solely with the practical phases\nof the question, it becomes apparent\nthat any section of the northwest is\nlikely to be visited sometime by such\na storm as that which devastated large\nsections of St. Paul and Minneapolis.\nWith regard to the storm in question,\ncongratulations can only be offered\nthat the loss of life was not greater.\nProperty damage is regrettable but\nrepaired with comparative ease. Loss\nof life is always the deplorable feature\nof such severe manifestations. In the\npresent instance- it was marvelouSly\nlow, due perhaps to the fact that peo\xad\nple had warning of the approach of\nthe storm and that the preceding rain\xad\nfall drove the usual Saturday night\ncrowds frtm the streets. So the storm\nwas not without its element of mercy.\nWith the energy and activity of the\ntrwo cities we may expect to see the\ndamage repaired in a short time.\nIt would seem that the class of ac\xad\ncidents most easily preventable and\nwhich are due to the most inexcusable\ncarelessness are those in which heavy\nthreshing machines go crashing\nthrough the country bridges across lit\xad\ntle streams, killing and maiming engi\xad\nneers and operators :, wrecking the\nbridges and damaging the threshing\nmachine property itself. In the con\xad\nstruction of bridges there should be\nsome test applied as to its capacity of\nsustaining heavy welgfits and every\nbridge in a country traversed by trac\xad\ntion engines should be adorned with a\nsign large enough to command atten\xad\ntion, stating the nature of Che test, and\nin case the bridge is not capable of\nsustaining the weight of a traction\nengine, warning all corners that its\njpaasage is accompanied with extreme\n.danger. In the past tew days there\nhare been two of these accidents in\n"the eastern part of the state in one of\nntftftih the engineer was killed and in\nVim other two men severely injured.\nThe fault lies in the first place in\nthe construction of bridges wfcich are\ntoo light for this traffic and secondari\xad\nly with the operators of this class of\nheavy machinery, who will trust them\xad\nselves and their property upon a\nbridge of unknown strength.\nThe possible delays that the techni\xad\ncalities of the law interpose between\nthe commission of a crime and its pun\xad\nishment are illustrated in the case of\nJohn Rooney. It will be noted else\xad\nwhere that an £«oeal has just been\ntaken to the United States supreme\ncourt in this case. Rooney has been\nin the state penitentiary for a year or\nmore, awaiting execution for the crime\nof murder. Writs, supersedeases, ca\xad\npiases, quo warafchtoB, mandamuses,\nappeals, and the other instruments of\nthe law have been applied, until if is\nnow nearly a year past the time\nRooney was sentenced to be hanged,\nand how long yet it will be before a\nfinal determination of his case will be\nreached no man can say. It is prob\xad\nable, however, that when Rooney is\nexecuted, "the majority of people will\nhave forgotten the nature and circum\xad\nstances of the crime and whatever ex\xad\nemplary effect the execution might\nhave had will be lost. At the same\ntime, there is no desire to rush a man\nto execution until every possible ave\xad\nnue of doubt has been closed, and to\npoint out the condition is easier than\nto suggest the remedy.\nThe Sheldon Progress thus discour\xad\nages leg-pulls of Col. Cooper. "To\nparaphrase one of the ancient joshers,\nthe newspaper boy® might just as well\ntry to cap out an extra insurance state\nmeat by tickling the dome of the capi\ntol as by jollying Colonel Cooper. The\ncolonel is an experienced campaign\nmanager and political worker and\nquite insensible to such wiles."\nThe Kidder Republican expects soon\nto enlarge to a seven column folio—to\nhave more room to talk.\nREGARDING THE BUTTER STATUE\nNo Truth In Reports that Butter\nStatue of President Roosevelt was\nMelting Away.\nSt. Louis, August 23.—The foolish\nstory in a Sit. Louis paper about the\nbutter statue of President Roosevelt\nin the North Dakota dairy display is\nutterly without truth or foundation\nand must have originated in a demo\xad\ncratic mind that sought to ridicule\nthe nation\'s head. The statue stands\nin a refrigerator where the tempera\xad\nture is never higher than 20 degrees,\nso it is an impossibility for anything\nto melt in there, therefore none of the\nNorth Dakota representatives have\never given a moment\'s worry on that\nscore or mentioned such a thing to a\nliving soul. The suggestion for the,\nstory probalbly arose from the fact that\nthe state manager wa» dissatisfied\nwith the finst statue made because it\nwas a miserable piece of work and\nwas in everyway unsatisfactory and\nimpossittle to make it so. Therefore,\nDuring the time he was awaiting\nthe return of Governor Bartlett Mr.\nFrolich modeled in North Dakota but\xad\nter a bust of the president to show\nwhat he could do. The work was so\nfine that the management of the agri\xad\nculture division of the fair asked and\nwas given the privilege of exhibiting\nthe bust with those already made of\nLincoln, Grant and Cleveland in a\nprominent part of the general butter\ndisplay.\nMinnesota has a beautiful piece of\nwork in butter being a representation\nof the discovery of St. Anthony falls\nby Father Hennepin. The foils are\nshown and above them in a canoe ars\nthe lifesize figures of FafEer Hennepin\nin the bow, an Indian in the middle\nand a frontiersman in the stern, the\nlast two paddling the frail bark. It\nis the work of Frank Daniels of St.\nPaul, the young man who made the\nsoldiers\' monument at Grafton. It is\nthe general opinion that the contest\nfor first .prize lies between these two\npieces.\nAfter a long dry spell the last three\ndays has given us enough rain to float\nships in the low places. Dampness\nreigns supreme everywhere and I\nmissed the comfort of a pipe last\nnight because the tobacco on my\nbureau had «baorted too much of the\ngeneral wetness, and the 1ed Sheets\nstuck to Ale like a long lost brother.\nBISMARCK DAILY TIUBUNB,\nin accordance with the right reserved\' sold mine here if he desires, but there\nby Gov. Bartlett in the contract, the\nstatue was not accepted and the con\xad\ntract given to a sculptor of known\nability, a graduate of one of the best\nare schools in Paris, F. H. Frolich of\nNew York, who has just completed a\npiece of work that is receiving great\npraise and that is a credit to the\nstate. As a result of the governor\'s\nrefusal to accept the first disreputable\nfigure the contractor has sued Gov.\nBartlett, much to the amusement of\neverybody familiar with the matter,\nall agreeing that under his contract\nthe party has not the ghost of a\nchance of recovering a cent.\nAmericans most be getting real\n-5 -f\n-A#\ngood. I have spent considerable time\namong the statuary exhibits of the\nEuropean nations and have noticed\nthat not one of the entrancing and\nclothesless marfole nymphs has a\n"sold" card attached, while from the\nfigures of innocent childhood and kin\xad\ndred subjects as many as 30 cards\nhang in long strings, showing that so\nmany copies of the original have been\nordered. The American don\'t seem to\nbe interested\' in the human fond un\xad\nadorned—done in marble. Throngs of\nhim wander past such group® with idle,\nalmost unheeding glance, the ravings\nof artistic natures over curves and\nthings is lost on him or her. On the\nother hand the presentment of a child\nat play or a baby face in dimpled\nsweetness appeals to his heart. The\nfact is the American people—the great\ncommon people—don\'t believe in any\xad\none going around- without enough\nclothes on, art or no art.\n"Why don\'t we eastern millers, when\nwe buy No. 1 hard wl^eat, get the same\nkind of wheat that you show here?"\nasked the owner of a large milling\nplant at Ogdensiburg, N. Y., yesterday\nof a North Dakota reperesentative.\n"Last fall I bought half a million bush\xad\nels of hard wheat at Duluth and it\nwas the most miserable stuff ever\npalmed off for a first class article,\nbut no better than -what we always\nget, and nothing like what you show\nhere. I have been buying what I sup\xad\nposed was your hard wheat for a num\xad\nber of years and it don\'t make me feel\ngood to think that I have regularly\ngotten the worst of it. If your" exhibit\nwas put on wheels and taken around\nthe eastern milling centers it would\nbring such a howl around- the Duluth\ncrowd\'s ears as might *wake them up a\nlittle and\' result in our getting a\nsquare deal."

Heavy rainstorms the latter part, in some\nplaces in the eastern and north central sections accom\xad\npanied by hail, not only delayed work, but did some dam\xad\nage to grain. High winds prevailed at times during the\nweek, lodging some heavy grain.\nMore reports of black rust are coming in, but the princi\xad\npal damage by it seems to have been confined to the Red\nriver valley counties, and those on the southern border,\nwhere its effect on wheat has been such that some fields\nare now being plowed under, and others burned ever. Of\ncourse in that section much of the early wheat is now har\xad\nvested, but late wheat is very poor, and but a small part of\nit will be cut. The rust seems to have only slightly af\xad\nfected oats, while rye, barley and flax have entirely es\xad\ncaped. Macaroni wheat is also reported to have suffered\nbut very little from rust.\nMost of the early sown wheat has been harvested,\nalthough in the northern sections the greater part of it is\nnot yet ripe, and it will take from ten days to two weeks of\nthe present weather to ripen it. Late sown wheat is poor\nin all sections, being damaged by dry weather in the cen\xad\ntral and western portions, while filling, besides being\nbadly rusted, as a rule.\nOats, rye and barley area very gopd crop most of them\nhave been cut, and some thrashed, the yield being very\nfavorable.\nFlax has made great progress during the past week, and\nwhile it is not up to the average of former years, and is\nquite late, yet if frost keeps off, there will be a better crop\nthan was anticipated a month ago.\nCorn is still backward, and it is doubtful if much of it\nwill mature before frost catches it.\nHaying is practically over, and a large crop of excellent\nquality has been secured.\nCOUNTIES.\nBARNES—Wheat cutting general early wheat badly rusted not\nover half a crop late wheat looks better.
