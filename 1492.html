Christopher* \n \nAbstract \n \nPetitioning includes the right of individuals directly to request the sovereign or \nparliament to redress grievances, heed protests, receive advice and consider relevant \ninformation, thereby circumventing intermediaries. Thus in the period 1833–1914, \nalthough most South African petitions were addressed to the local authorities, some \nwere sent directly to the House of Commons in London, as the ultimate effective apex \nof the imperial governmental system.  Most petitions were concerned with personal \ngrievances against the government, while others were concerned with political \nadvocacy in the form of protest or advice, including substantial supporting \ninformation. Only three political issues attracted wider action within the settler \nsociety, amounting to concerted campaigns. These were the introduction of \nrepresentative government in the Cape of Good Hope; opposition to the settlement of \ntransported criminals from the United Kingdom; and support for the maintenance of \nthe established status of the Church of England.  From the 1880s, petitions by \nindigenous Africans raised protests at political developments that affected them \nnegatively, notably political exclusion from parliament. However, the scale of South \nAfrican petitioning was small and essentially marginal to political discourse in \nLondon. \n \nKeywords: South Africa; British Empire; petitions; parliament; constitutional change; \nchurch governance. \n \nOpsomming \n \nPetisionering sluit die reg in van die indiwidu om op direkte wyse die heerser of \nparlement te versoek om griewe aan te spreek en reg te stel, om op proteste ag te \nslaan, en om advies te ontvang en relevante inligting in ag te neem.

The right has \nbeen exercised in many societies over a long period of time under a variety of forms \nand names.2 In the European form, petitions were usually addressed to the king or \nruler, but could also be presented to lower orders of administration possessing a \nmore immediate means of securing justice or carrying out the desired changes. They \nalso included pleas from those who were disenfranchised, notably women, who \nsought to bring their plights or concerns to the attention of the authorities for \nredress.3 Some petitions were highly localised and less formally phrased and \nstructured raising specific issues of tenant/landowner and employer/employee \n                                                          \n1.

This was particularly noticeable in peripheral or \ncolonial communities whose inhabitants sought to draw their specific problems to the \nattention of distant governments, which petitioners considered might lack sufficient \ninformation to be able to appraise the situation.5 In time, petition writing was widely \nadopted by disenfranchised colonial peoples, as a means of appealing to the \nauthorities for the redress of grievances and raise issues of political advocacy and \nprotest.6  \n \nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries a new society evolved in South \nAfrica as a result of European overseas settlement within an expanding British \nEmpire.7  Although faced with different concerns from those faced by the United \nKingdom, many of the English constitutional practices were retained by emergent \ncolonial societies. At the same time, the authorities sought to incorporate African \nindigenous peoples into the imperial system by instilling a common British identity, \nowing allegiance to the monarch, thereby aligning African traditional leadership with \n                                                          \n4.

Malan, in \n1927 as: “every South African national is, and must be, a British subject. South African \nnationality is merely a smaller circle within a larger one”.10 The functioning of the \nBritish Empire has been represented as a series of networks, webs and circuits \nlinking the various parts, peoples and institutions together.11 Within this network \n“the centrality of London” as the focus of power, patronage, finance and \ncommunication was a vital link.12 In this paper it is proposed to examine one of the \nstrands in this web of empire, linking one peripheral society to the centre. This was \ncomposed of the flow of information contained in the series of petitions from South \nAfrica to the House of Commons in Westminster, between the reform of parliament in \nthe 1830s and the First World War. The article begins with an overview of the \npetitioning process and the place of colonial petitions within the overall scheme of \nthe House of Commons. There follows a chronological review of the petitions received \nfrom South Africa, marking the changes in the concerns raised. A conclusion seeks to \ndraw the threads together. \n \nPetitioning the House of Commons \n \nThe right of anyone, whether male or female, enfranchised or not, to approach the \nsovereign or parliament directly for the redress of grievances or for a solution of their \nproblems is one of the basic rights enshrined in the common law of England and the \nvarious countries whose legal systems are derived from it.13 In the reign of Edward I \n(1272–1307) parliament gained a major role in the solicitation, reception and \nprocessing of petitions drawn-up according to set rules and procedures. They could \nbe concerned with matters of both national and local concern and provided valuable \n                                                          \n8.  C.V.

Nevertheless, petitions were received and dealt with by the local \nauthorities with appeals to the king as a last recourse.16 Petitioning was incorporated \ninto the laws and usages of the colonies and states which evolved as a result of \nEnglish and British colonial activity. Thus the American Continental Congress \npetitioned the king for redress in the period before the declaration of independence.17 \nSimilarly, the West Indian parliaments and colonists’ interest groups sent petitions to \nparliament favouring the retention of slavery in the late eighteenth and early \nnineteenth centuries.18 However, most petitions concerning the colonies originated in \nthe United Kingdom, notably during the controversies surrounding the abolition of \nthe slave trade and slavery.19 Thus between 1824 and 1833 some 20 000 petitions \nwere received in favour of the abolition of slavery in the colonies.20 In 1833 alone a \ntotal of 5 020 petitions with 1.3 million signatures originated within the United \nKingdom, calling for the abolition of slavery.21 Although the right was clearly stated, \ncolonial subjects exercised this approach comparatively rarely with regard to the \ndistant imperial parliament in London because most grievances involved the local \nadministration and therefore might be more readily dealt with locally. An approach to \nthe authorities in London was essentially a last resort when all other avenues of \nredress had been exhausted and the petitioners considered a final appeal to those \nperceived to possess the power to overcome local obstacles. \n \nThe handling of petitions by parliament was reorganised and streamlined \nbetween 1833 and 1842 as part of the general political transformation associated \n                                                          \n14.

The petition was then referred to the permanent Select \nCommittee on Public Petitions for consideration.23 It was then subjected to scrutiny to \nsee that it was drawn up in the prescribed manner; that the subject was within the \nambit of parliamentary oversight; and to determine what action needed to be taken. \nNotably, requests for direct financial assistance were not entertained. The historic \nform and humble wording of petitions often recalled the prayers of the Church for \ndivine intervention in human affairs.24 \n \nPetitions were required to be drawn up in three sections and “should be \nspecifically and respectfully addressed to the House of Commons”.25 The first section \ncame with the humble request to the honourable House for redress, identifying the \npetitioners, followed by a statement of the problem facing the petitioners, including \nprevious attempts to secure satisfaction, and finally a proposed course of action to \nalleviate or solve the problem had to be clearly laid out. The persons addressing the \nHouse had to state their names and sign or make their mark on the petition, or if \nsubmitted by a corporate entity, the entity’s seal might be attached. After the reforms \nin 1833, printed lists of the petitions were published and indexed by the name of the \nfirst petitioner or corporate body under five broad subject headings (Parliament, \nEcclesiastical, Colonies, Taxes, Miscellaneous) and then listed by individual topic for \nthe parliamentary record of the committee’s meetings.26 In addition the full texts of \nsome were printed as numbered appendices, although where they differed \ncomparatively little from others already published, they were not printed but were \nindicated as being similar to the one previously printed. (During many of the major \npetitioning campaigns local meetings often used the wording of an existing petition.) \nIn this process of compression, nearly all the names of the petitioners and dates were \nlost and editorial amendments were made ensuring a degree of standardisation in the \nprinted record. These sets of documents represent the surviving record because most \nof the original petitions were then destroyed as a space saving exercise.27 \n \n                                                          \n22.

The flow was highly erratic with marked peaks and \ntroughs. Thus in the two peak years of 1843 and 1893, some 33 898 and 33 742 \npetitions respectively were presented bearing 6.1 and 5.0 million signatures \nrespectively. It has been observed that: \n \nAt a time when petitioning has been reduced to an anachronism with no \nsignificant role in public affairs it is easy to overlook its importance in popular \npolitics in the 1840s. During the Chartist years petitioning was arguably the most \ncommon form of political activity in Britain in this era, reaching its apex with the \nmassive petitions organized by the Chartists.28  \n \nPeaks were balanced by years with fewer than 10 000 petitions in the preceding five \nyears on both occasions. As the parliamentary correspondent for The Times noted in \n1901, it was only “those prepared as a result of widespread concerted action”, which \ngained attention. He further commented that: “the belief in the efficacy of individual \nappeals to Parliament has not yet entirely died out … but if the man in the street could \nsee how unceremoniously the ordinary memorial is dealt with this belief would not \nlong survive”.29 It was a measure of the widening of the franchise that there was a \ngeneral decline in petitioning, as the actions of organised political parties assumed \ngreater significance in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, thereby \naffording the means of concerted action required to effect changes.30  \n \nTable 1: Petitions presented to the House of Commons 1833–1914 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \nYears   Total number of Number of colonial Number of South \n   petitions  petitions  African petitions \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n1833–42  108 407  332   6 \n1843–52  144 203  227   35 \n1853–62  114 763  221   6 \n1863–72  157 728  2 128   16 \n1873–82  165 272  245   4 \n1883–92  124 034  993   1 \n1893–1902  92 487  1 040   1 \n1903–14  53 227    74   9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \nTotal   960 121  5 260   78 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \nSource:  Reports of the Select Committee on Public Petitions, 1833–1914. \n                                                          \n28.

In addition, petitions offered the \ngovernment a valuable source of information on the state of Indian society, the \nproblems it encountered and the deficiencies of the colonial responses.32 \nFurthermore, in societies with low levels of literacy, before the introduction of \nuniversal education in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, scribes, clerks, \nlawyers and letter-writers were available to record, translate and attest for people \nunable to do so themselves. Thus petitioning was open to literate and illiterate alike, \nwhether in thirteenth century England or nineteenth and twentieth-century South \nAfrica and India. Thus the scale of colonial petitioning also reflected the size of the \npopulation, which in 1911 had reached 315.2 million in India compared with only 6.0 \nmillion in South Africa.33 In making these identifications there is some ambiguity as \nthe number of petitions concerning colonial affairs was far higher. There were \npetitions from businessmen with interests in various colonies, retired colonial civil, \nnaval and army officers as well as lawyers representing colonial interests, who were \nresident in the United Kingdom and have been excluded from the calculations.34 On \noccasion residents of the colonies petitioned parliament while they were visiting \nEngland, and these petitions, where they are clearly identifiable, have been included \nin the colonial totals. \n \nA third of the petitions (27) originating from South Africa were presented in \nthe two years 1850 and 1851. These were concerned with the question of a new \nconstitution for the Cape of Good Hope and the introduction of representative \ngovernment, and also with the introduction of transported convicts. Political \ndevelopments were otherwise rare subjects because the main complaints concerned \npersonal grievances against the local authorities, where no satisfaction could be \nobtained by the petitioners. The right to petition was maintained as part of the \ninalienable heritage of being a British subject, wherever, he or she might reside.

They \nobjected to the Order-in-Council of 1831 issued for the improvement of slave \nconditions: \n \n… bearing upon the face thereof the stamp of utter ignorance of the condition of \nSlavery in, and of the general state of this Colony, but moreover introducing a \nseries of most harassing and vexatious duties upon the Masters, exposing them to \na cruel system of oppression, subjecting them to a number of ruinous penalties \nwithout almost the power of escape … to destroy all value of slave property… to \ndrive your Petitioners to ruin and despair.36 \nThe solution proposed was the introduction of a legislative assembly for the Cape \nColony, which would draw up its own laws and regulations, free of interference from \nthe London authorities. Such a loosening of imperial links was in marked contrast to a \npetition in 1875 when some 22 937 members of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha and \nother inhabitants of the Bombay presidency which called for the direct election of \nrepresentatives of India in the imperial parliament in order to overcome a lack of \nlocal knowledge in the House of Commons.37 \n \nIt is scarcely surprising that the petitions were often lengthy with extensive \nhistorical backgrounds to the problems and arguments presented, rather than the \nmore usual brief supportive or negative comments on pending legislation which \ndominated petitions originating in the United Kingdom. As an example, the second \nSouth African petition in the period, presented in 1835, began as follows: \n \nPetition of the undersigned resident Colonists of the District of Albany, in the \nColony of the Cape of Good Hope, now in London. \nHumbly sheweth, \nThat your honourable House, in the Session of the year 1819, acceded to a grant \nof £50,000 for the purpose of sending out settlers to colonize a division of the \nColony of the Cape of Good Hope. \n                                                          \n35.

Thus in 1842, a petition from the inhabitants of Cape Town and vicinity linked \nthe two, showing: \n \nThat at the present period they think it unnecessary to offer any argument in \nfavour of that form of government of which Her Majesty is the head, or to point \nout the inevitable disadvantages under which a government must labour which \npossesses no constitutional means of ascertaining public opinion, or to show that \na people thus excluded from all influences on the action of government must \nadvance slowly, if at all, in the career of improvement: these facts have been \ndecided by the concurrent testimony of all ages. They think it enough to \nrepresent that in numbers, wealth, and intelligence, they consider this \ncommunity fully prepared to take their place in the ranks of free countries, being \nassured that Her Majesty only waited for such an assurance before confiding in \nthem their due weight in the legislature of their own country.44 \n \nIn 1848 the movement became more active. A petition was drawn up and signed \nby 80 inhabitants of the Koeberg area in the Cape District in 1848, and was followed \nby two more from the inhabitants of Stellenbosch (22 signatures) and combined Cape \nand Stellenbosch districts (58 signatures). The Koeberg petition noted the extension \nof self-government to the colonies, but the tardiness of its introduction at the Cape \nand desired that it be implemented “more promptly”.45 In 1850 the petitioning took \non a more concerted nature, with more specific demands. In 1851 a precise \nconstitution of 16 articles was presented by Cape Town petitioners, to overcome \nflaws perceived in the proposed official provisions, which had “entirely lost the \nconfidence of Her Majesty’s faithful people”.46 Two articles concerning eligibility to \nvote and to stand for election are particularly intriguing, representing a demand for a \ncolour-blind franchise and membership: \n \nArt 5. Every male inhabitant of the full age of 21 years, who shall have occupied \nfixed property for his own use and benefit of the value of £25, for 12 calendar \nmonths next preceding the registration and time of voting within the limits of an \nelectoral division shall be entitled to vote for members of Assembly to represent \nthat division, and for members of Council. \nArt 6.

Once elected in 1854, the Cape of \nGood Hope House of Assembly duly received over a hundred petitions per year on \naverage in its first decade of existence. These covered a wide variety of personal and \nlocal grievances, suggestions for improvements and political comment, particularly \nupon bills under consideration by the assembly.50  \n \nEntangled with the constitutional issue was that of the future character of \ncolonial society, notably the question of the transportation of convicts from the \nUnited Kingdom to penal colonies. The proposal to use the Cape of Good Hope for this \npurpose met marked resistance as inhibiting the future development of the colony, \nand was characterised as a “struggle [that] has created a people of South Africa”.51 In \n1848 the Municipality of Cape Town drew up a petition, presented to parliament the \nfollowing year, noting:  \n \nThat Her Majesty’s Government contemplate transporting to this colony persons \nconvicted of political and other crimes or offences, for the purpose, amongst \nothers, of supplying any deficiency of labour which may exist in this colony, have \nhumbly and most dutifully represented to Her Majesty the injustice of converting \nthis colony into a penal settlement, and the danger of exposing the multitudes of \nsemi-barbarous tribes it contains to the evil influences of such persons, and \nbeseeching, for the reasons set forth in the Petition to Her Majesty, that the \nmeasure may not be carried out.52   \n \nFurther petitions were sent the following year by the Municipality of Cape \nTown as a result of public meetings held by the inhabitants.53 In 1850 this was \nsupported by the inhabitants of Port Elizabeth, requesting the House to “pass an Act \nwhereby the Cape Colony shall be declared now and for ever Free, a Colony which \n                                                          \n47.

The commissioners \nof the Municipality of Cape Town drew up a petition in 1851 refuting official \nallegations of “the determined and dogged inactivity of the farmers, especially the \nDutch”, noting that “the proceedings of the colonists in general, and of the farmers in \nparticular; as evincing the most unquestionable loyalty to Her Majesty’s person and \nthrone, which the most arbitrary and despotic measures could not alienate or impair”, \nand further stating: \n \nIn the opinion of your petitioners, such removal of the seat of government would \nbe injudicious, attended with enormous expense, be an act of gross injustice, and \nan unwarrantable assumption on the part of the colonial secretary to dispose of \nthe question of the deepest interest of the inhabitants at large without consulting \nthem in the matter.57   \n \nIt gave an extensive list of reasons not to move and suggested that the issue be left for \nthe future Cape parliament to decide.  \n \nThe British government’s decision to abandon the Orange River Sovereignty in \n1854 drew condemnation from meetings of the inhabitants of Colesberg, as being \n“intimately acquainted with the condition and character and the several \nrequirements of the various classes of Her Majesty’s subjects both here and in this \ncolony, whose future welfare would be seriously compromised by the withdrawal of \nHer Majesty’s authority from that settlement”, who then petitioned parliament.58 It \nwas noted that wool exports and imports of manufactured goods were rising rapidly, \nwhile the administration had brought order, investment and prosperity to the area, \nwhich would be severely compromised by the withdrawal.  Public petitions from the \ninhabitants of Cape Town and Port Elizabeth were also sent to the House protesting \nat the abandonment of the Orange River Sovereignty.59 In consequence of the \nabandonment aggrieved parties petitioned the House of Commons for redress of their \nlosses. These included three land surveyors who had surveyed farms in connection \nwith the issue of title deeds and received no recompense from the new government.60 \n                                                          \n54.

The new Cape and Natal constitutions incorporated the right \nof petition to the colonial parliaments and this became an intermediate recourse for \naggrieved persons. However, some still pursued the option of petitioning the imperial \nparliament, where no satisfaction could be found in Cape Town or Pietermaritzburg. \nProposals for the incorporation of British Kaffraria in the Cape Colony in the early \n1860s as an economy measure produced negative reactions locally. In 1863 a petition \nfrom 1 024 inhabitants of the colony was drawn up for presentation to parliament \nnoting that the removal of the executive government, including a resident lieutenantgovernor,\njudge, attorney-general and “necessary officers for administering a \ngovernment”, would “seriously retard the prosperity of this colony, and involve the \nwhole of the South African Colonies at no remote period in another disastrous and \nexpensive Kafir war”.62 The petitioners requested that the separate status of the \ncolony be maintained. Two years later the warning was repeated noting that “the seat \nof government of the Cape Colony being too removed from the frontier to effectively \nguard and watch over the native affairs, which at a distance of 700 miles would \nbecome complicated and lead to disastrous results”.63 Two years later another \npetition against the withdrawal troops from the frontier requested “Her Majesty’s \nGovernment to extend the protection of Her forces to the colonists as they have \nhitherto enjoyed it”.64 The petition was rejected by the colonial secretary in view of \nthe financial burden of stationing troops in the colony and problems of local \nsupport.65 \n \nIn other cases, personal problems, which were ignored by the local \ngovernments, did reach London after procrastination in South Africa. Thus the plight \nof the military settlers, widows and orphaned children of the murdered men of the \nvillages of Auckland, Ely, Johannesberg and Woburn in the Victoria East district were \npresented to parliament in 1864, some sixteen years after the chain of events \ncommenced.

The subject of eleven of them involved ecclesiastical matters, which in the \nUnited Kingdom exercised the minds of many petitioners, who could be organised \nand coordinated through the local church structures of parishes and congregations on \nmatters ranging from church disestablishment to temperance and even the \npopulation census.67 In this case petitions were concerned with the controversy \nsurrounding the case of the Bishop of Natal, John Colenso, following the attempt by \nthe Archbishop of Cape Town to depose him for heresy. This action had brought the \nlegal status of colonial bishops into question and prompted the summoning of the \nfirst Lambeth Conference of Anglican diocesan bishops from around the world by the \nArchbishop of Canterbury in 1867, to which Dr Colenso was not invited. The \nrelationship between the Church in England and Anglican churches elsewhere came \nunder scrutiny as the overseas dioceses gained greater independence and authority.68 \nA petition from Cape Town expressed a general concern: \n \nYour Petitioners humbly pray that no measures may receive the sanction of your \nhonourable House which shall be calculated to interfere with the existing status \nof the Church of England in the colonies as being an integral part of the Church of \nEngland.69 \n \nThe confusion is illustrated by the variety of issues expressed in the petitions. The \nclergy of Cape Town requested certainty for the legal position and the applicability of \nEnglish statute law in South Africa.70 A petition from Port Elizabeth raised the \nquestion of the legitimacy of colonial bishops and their appointment.71 A petition \nfrom the laity of Uitenhage was concerned with the maintenance of the church \nsupremacy of the queen.72  The proposal to consecrate a rival bishop in Natal incurred \nthe displeasure of the imperial government, which instructed the colonial \ngovernment to attempt to prevent such an event.

Even the \noutbreak of war in Zululand in 1879 elicited no reaction from South Africa, although \n120 petitions on the subject originated in the United Kingdom condemning the war.74 \nHowever, three petitions from the Cape Colony in that year dealt with the alteration \nof tariffs on alcohol imported into the United Kingdom. That from the Chamber of \nCommerce of Cape Town explained the problem and sought changes: \n \nThat in consequence of the alteration in the tariff and the introduction of the \nAlcoholic Test, the wines of this colony are virtually excluded from the English \nmarket, because although naturally strong in body experience has proved that a \ncertain amount of spirits is required in addition to the natural strength to fortify \nthe same during so long a voyage, as across the tropics, and in consequence it is \nfound impractical to send Cape wines to the home market.75 \n \n Political changes in South Africa were occasionally brought to the attention of \nthe House by residents, usually as a matter of seeking redress of personal and wider \ngrievances.

Sauer, political leaders in the Cape colonial \nlegislature petitioned the House of Commons against the developments in South \nAfrica and were particularly concerned about the future constitutional dispensation:  \n \nThat your Petitioners have heard with great concern that it is the intention of His \nMajesty’s Government to constitute, in the territories recently known as the \nOrange Free State and the South African Republic, Crown Colony Government. \nThey would venture most respectfully to submit that this form of government, \nfollowing as it does upon republican institutions, will tend to repel the \ninhabitants, and that they will in the humble opinion of your Petitioners, judging \nfrom past experience, lead to great friction and much future trouble the result of \nwhich will most grievously affect your Petitioners and those whom they \nrepresent.80 \n \nIn 1906 five petitions were sent by various organisations representing the \nAfrican and coloured populations of the Cape Colony condemning the proposed \nfranchise clauses in the new constitutions of the Orange River Colony and the \nTransvaal as discriminating against people of colour. That of the Coloured Peoples \nVigilance Committee noted that in contrast to the colour-blind constitution of the \nCape Colony:  \n \nThat your Petitioners now learn in fear that it is proposed to grant a constitution \nto the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies which embody opposite principles to \n                                                          \n78.

He maintained that this was a miscarriage of justice as a \nresult of the unlawful retrospective application of martial law regulations. As a result: \n“incursions into Native Reserves led to wanton damage”, whereupon: “they stood up \nto resist, not because they were traitors, but rather because they were Zulus and \nbecause they were men”.83 A similar petition was sent the following year.84 The \nmatter was referred back to the prime minister of Natal, and no further action was \ntaken, as the matter was deemed to fall within the competency of the colonial \ngovernment.85 \n \nIn 1909 two petitions reached the House objecting to aspects of the proposed \nSouth African constitution. The first, from the representatives of “five coloured and \nnative congresses”, sought to warn the House of the potential alienation of the \nmajority of the population of the country as a result of constitutional exclusion from \nthe political process: \n \nThat the status of the coloured people and the natives will be lowered, and that \nan injustice will be done to those who are the majority of the people in British \nSouth Africa, who in the past have shown their unswerving loyalty to the Crown, \ntheir attachment to British institutions, their submission to the laws of the land; \nand their capacity for exercising full civil and political rights.86  \n                                                          \n81.

A similar petition \nfrom the Reverend Elijah Makiwane and 2 000 members of the Macfarlan Mission \nrequested the removal of: “The discrimination against colour clauses for membership \nof parliament, allowing for possible disenfranchisement and from a part in the \ndelimitation process”.87 The British parliament showed no inclination to overturn \ndecisions on the future constitution made at the South African National Convention \nand ratified by the four colonial parliaments. It is worth noting that political \ndevelopments in South Africa attracted attention in India from where a petition by \n“Indian subjects of His Majesty the King Emperor living in the Presidency of Madras, \nand are greatly interested in the liberties, well-being, and prosperity of their fellow \nIndian subjects in the Transvaal”, which noted the “increasing prejudice amongst the \n‘white’ population in the South African colonies against Asiatics in general, and British \nIndians in particular”.88   \n \n No more petitions from South Africa were presented to the honourable House \nbefore the First World War. Nevertheless, in 1914, one was prepared by the newly \nformed South African Native National Congress, protesting at the 1913 Natives’ Land \nAct and drawing attention to its negative consequences for the African population, \nwhich lacked an effective voice in the South African legislature. However, as a result \nof official obstruction and the outbreak of war, it was not presented to parliament.89 \nSubsequently it was published in pamphlet form as an appeal to the people of Great \nBritain.90 This outcome was clearly a recognition that any intervention in South \nAfrican internal affairs was now beyond the competence of the imperial parliament \nand a consequent narrowing of options open to African political organisations.91 \n \nComment \n \nThe series of petitions from South Africans to the House of Commons in London \nbetween 1833 and 1914 presents one minor strand in the web of communications \nand flow of information within the British Empire. The strand spans the time from the \nfirst petition in 1833 which was concerned with white colonists wishing to retain \nslavery, to the last from African political movements and churches condemning the \nnew South African constitution. This strand in the imperial web is of importance in \ndemonstrating the longevity and adaptability of inherited practices even when the \npowers nominally vested in London had in reality passed to delegated local \n                                                          \n87.

The nature of the petitions themselves changed through the period in line \nwith changes noted elsewhere as personal grievances in large measure gave way to \npolitical advocacy and protest. Both motives tended to emphasise the differences \nwhich opened between the interests and outlook of an emerging colonial society and \nthose in the imperial metropole. Personal grievances focused upon the perceived \nshortcomings of the imperial governments, notably their lack of support, false \npromises, misguided policies and procrastination; issues common to the entire \nhistory of petitioning.   \n \nPolitical advocacy in the form of protest and advice revolved around the \ndevelopment of new imperial policies, in order to influence the course of events \nrather than be passive bystanders. Only three issues excited a marked response from \nSouth African petitioners.  The transportation crisis raised the issue of the future \ncharacter of society in the country as a convict colony. The successful opposition to \nimperial policy, created a sense of solidarity in white society. The prompting of the \nintroduction of representative government, in line with the North American and \nAustralasian colonies, similarly departed from a centralised imperial administration \nand the emergence of self-governing states, controlled by the settler communities. \nHowever, the third major petitioning movement was backward looking concerned \nwith the preservation of the status of the Church of England in the light of the \ndisestablishment debates in Ireland and other colonies. A late development was the \nlargely unsuccessful initiation of petitioning by the indigenous African population to \ndraw attention to constitutional developments in the country which negatively \nimpacted upon them, notably access to the local franchise. In this process loyalty to \nthe imperial link, particularly the Crown, was stressed as a means of restraining the \nsettler communities, which controlled the local legislatures, from further diminishing \nthe legal status of the African and coloured population. The use of political petitioning \nfollowed the precedent demonstrated by the indigenous inhabitants of other colonial \ndependencies, notably India. In all cases petitions included substantial amounts of \nsupporting information to advance the case presented. This was of value to the \nauthorities in the tasks of adjudication and administration and remains as an insight \ninto the concerns of the age raised by specific groups and individuals.  \n \nThe successful characteristics of political advocacy and protest included mass \npetitioning through either large numbers of signatures or large numbers of petitions. \nNeither option was open to South Africans as the population of the country was small \nand there were rarely more than a few petitions presented on any issue, enabling the \nHouse of Commons to ignore them, when confronted with more immediate problems. \nPetitioning the honourable House was though a link of final recourse, when all else \nhad failed, symbolising the continued unity of the British Empire in an era when local \npolitical processes were evolving rapidly. Colonial political advancement essentially \nmade the strand obsolete, as local legislatures assumed increasing control over their \nown affairs, and the imperial parliament became unwilling and ultimately unable to \nintervene. It is worth observing that the right to petition parliament was retained in \nlocal constitutions, based on the Westminster model, and has remained a vital \nelement in the governmental process as a direct link between rulers and ruled. \n \n', 'Christopher – South African petitions to the House of Commons \n \n21 \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAbraham, S., “Formal Writing, Questionnaires and Petitions: Colonial Governance and \nLaw in early Malabar, 1792–1810”, Indian Historical Review, 40, 2 (2013). \nAkurang-Parry, K.O., ‘“A smattering of education’ and Petitions as Sources: A Study of \nAfrican Slaveholders’ Responses to Abolition in the Gold Coast Colony, 1874–\n1875”, History in Africa, 37 (2000). \nBell, P.M.H., Disestablishment in Ireland and Wales (S.P.C.K., London, 1969). \nBlaine, M.S., “The Power of Petitions: Women and the New Hampshire Provincial \nGovernment, 1695–1770”, International Review of Social History, 46, 9 (2001). \nBradley, J.E., “Parliament, Print Culture and Petitioning in late Eighteenth-century \nEngland”, Parliamentary History, 26, 1 (2007). \nBrand, P., “Petitions and Parliament in the Reign of Edward I”, Parliamentary History, \n23, 1 (2004). \nChristopher, A.J., “The Religious Question in the United Kingdom Census, 1801–2011”, \nJournal of Ecclesiastical History, 65, 3 (2014). \nCorbett, N., “Parliamentary Petitions: An Untapped Library Resource”, Australian \nLibrary Journal, 60, 3 (2011). \nDodd, G., Justice and Grace: Private Petitioning and the English Parliament in the late \nMiddle Ages (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2007). \nDrescher, S., Capitalism and Antislavery: British Mobilization in Comparative \nPerspective (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984). \nDrescher, S., “Public Opinion and Parliament in the Abolition of the British Slave \nTrade”, Parliamentary History, 26, 1 (2007). \nEllingford, K., “The Purpose, Practice and Effects of Petitioning the Victorian \nParliament”, Australasian Parliamentary Review, 23, 2 (2008).  \nFraser, P., “Public Petitioning and Parliament before 1832”, History, 26, 158 (1961). \nGreenaway, J., Drink and British Politics since 1830: A Study in Policy Making (Palgrave \nMacmillan, Basingstoke, 2003). \nHandley, R., “Public Order, Petitioning and Freedom of Assembly”, Journal of Legal \nHistory, 7, 2 (1986). \nHattersley, A.F., The Convict Crisis and the Growth of Unity: Resistance to \nTransportation in South Africa and Australia, 1848–1853 (University of Natal \nPress, Pietermaritzburg, 1965). \nHeerma van Voss, L., “Petitions in Social History: Introduction”, International Review \nof Social History, 46, 9 (2001). \nHirst, D., “Making Contact: Petitions and the English Republic”, Journal of British \nStudies, 45, 1 (2006). \nHough, R., “Do Legislative Petitions Enhance the Relationship between Parliament \nand Citizen?” Journal of Legislative Systems, 18, 3-4 (2012). \nHouston, R.A., Peasant Petitions: Social Relations and Economic Life on Landed Estates \n(Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, 2014). \nHughes, H., First President: A Life of John Dube, Founding President of the ANC (Jacana, \nJohannesburg, 2011). \nJack, M., Erskine May’s Treatise on the Law, Privileges and Usage of Parliament \n(NexisLexis, London, 2011). \n', 'Christopher – South African petitions to the House of Commons \n \n22 \n \nJohnson, J.K., ‘“Claims of equity and justice’: Petitions and Petitioners in Upper Canada \n1815–1840”, Histoire Sociale/Social History, 28, 55 (1995). \nJudge, D., “Public Petitions and the House of Commons”, Parliamentary Affairs, 31, 4 \n(1978). \nKapteijns, L. and Spaulding, J., “Women of the Zar and Middle-class Sensibilities in \nColonial Aden, 1923–1932”, Sudanic Africa, 5 (1994). \nKaris, T. and Carter, G.M.
