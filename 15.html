        <pre>['What is global education and where is it taking us?\nAlex Standish*\nGeography Education, Institute of Education, University of London, London, UK\nGlobal education began as a movement to reform education and\nsociety in the 1960s and 1970s, through the work of educationalists,\nNGOs and also intergovernmental organisations. The global approach\nseeks to break with a curriculum that is grounded in subject knowledge\nand national culture. Instead, it seeks to explore alternative rationales\nfor education and alternate futures. A second wave of global or\ninternational education occurred from the 1990s alongside discussion\nof globalisation, which brought the movement into mainstream\neducation. One of the characteristics of global/international education\nis its ambiguity. It seeks to break with the past curriculum, but it is not\nalways clear what will take its place. For some, preparing young people\nfor the global market is foremost, while others aim to facilitate the\nchild’s sense of himself or herself as a personal being. What is common\nto both is a desire to challenge the boundaries that previously gave\nmeaning to education (especially theoretical knowledge and culture)\nand a search for meaning and opportunity in the projection of power\nbeyond national boundaries. We conclude by questioning whether\nchildren are adequately prepared to act as global citizens without an\neducation based on academic knowledge and an ethical framework\nthat is culturally grounded.\nKeywords: global; international; citizen; knowledge; ethics; curriculum\nIntroduction\nEvery child in the US needs 21st century knowledge and skills to succeed as\neffective citizens, workers and leaders in the 21st century. . ..There is a profound\ngap between the knowledge and skills most students learn in school\nand the knowledge and skills they need in typical 21st century communities\nand workplaces. (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2009)\nLike many other advocates for educational reform, the Partnership for\n21st Century Skills (P21) articulates the need for education to align with\nthe needs of a Global Age. In their view, there is a ‘profound gap’ between\nwhat is being taught in schools and the skills and knowledge young people\nneed for living and working in today’s world. Spanning multiple countries,\n*Email: a.standish@ioe.ac.uk\n\x01 2014 British Educational Research Association\nThe Curriculum Journal, 2014\nVol. 25, No. 2, 166–186, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09585176.2013.870081\n', 'there are many advocates for a global approach to education including\ngovernments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), corporations, academics\nand some teachers. This movement asserts that new global realities\nincluding multicultural communities, the global market and post-national\npolitics demand a new approach to schooling.\nWriting in The Curriculum Journal, Graham Butt discusses the impact\nof globalisation on education and the response of policy makers in the\nUK. The transition from national to global education is often presented\nas not only a logical next step, but also a necessary one because ‘The\nforces of globalisation affect the lives of everybody on the planet’ (Butt,\n2011, p. 423). The Global Age is characterised by change and uncertainty,\nbrought about by social and economic forces beyond the control of the\nnation state, and so knowledge and skills very quickly become outdated.\nIn this fluid environment, knowledge of the past, the subject-based curriculum,\nis presented as less important than the skills for acquiring knowl-\nedge and working with others.\nThis article aims to contribute towards an understanding of the social\nconstruction of global education and to consider how it expands the\nmeaning of education. This is not to deny the reality of economic, political\nand cultural change over recent decades, but to identify the ways in which\ndifferent advocates have articulated narratives for a global approach to\neducation by way of response. The emphasis placed in this study on the\nsocially constructed nature of global education is different from other\nresearch on globalisation and education which often portrays policy and\ncurricular change as being driven by external ‘forces of globalisation’. For\ninstance, Butt accurately describes how education is being transformed\nthrough policies of marketisation, managerialism, the application of business\nmodels and by being treated as a private rather than a public good\n(2011, p. 428). Less often raised are questions about why educationalists\nand schools have been so open to ideas and practices that may be pertinent\nto the world of business or politics and how their adoption by\nschools changes education. Here, we explore how the boundaries that separate\neducation from other social activities have been eroded and how this\naffects the educational process.\nMethodology and theoretical background\nGiven the range and wide use of the term global in educational contexts\nthe scope of this research was purposefully wide, such that we could make\nsense of its meaning. This study focuses on two countries in which global\neducation has been on the rise: the United States and England. It is\nprimarily concerned with recent initiatives for global and international\neducation (often the preferred term in the USA) in primary and secondary\nstate schools (kindergarten through grade 12). The global approach also\nThe Curriculum Journal 167\n', 'penetrates higher education, but with less coordinated efforts. However,\nthis was not the focus of this study.\nThe methodology for this research project was primarily content analysis\nof policy documents and curricular materials. Policy documents were\nselected on the basis of their importance at national, international or state\nlevel, especially those published by government or state education bodies.\nLatent content analysis was conducted on policy documentation, curricular\nresources and guidelines published for teachers/student-teachers and\nlesson materials for pupils. The results of this analysis and some examples\nof curricular activities are presented below.\nAfter the literature survey had been completed it was apparent which\nstates and organisations were leaders in the field, including Wisconsin,\nNorth Carolina, the Asia Society and the American Forum for Global\nEducation in the USA; and, Oxfam, Practical Action, the Department for\nInternational Development, the Development Education Association\n(now Think Global) and regional centres for development education in\nEngland. As part of the research project, we visited four American and\nthree English schools with a focus on global or international learning,\nfour NGOs and the UK Department for International Development. If\nwe are asserting that the meaning of education has been expanded\nthrough the narrative of global education, we must first be clear about\nhow education derived its meaning in previous periods and contexts.\nThere are of course different traditions of education to arise out of modern\nwestern society. Loosely, we might label these as vocational, conserva-\ntive, progressive and liberal. We will refer to these traditions below,\nespecially the vocational and progressive rationales for education which\nstrongly inform the narratives of global education. While some traditions\ntie education to an extrinsic aim (preparation for work, social change,\nand maintenance of tradition) the liberal, humanist tradition most clearly\nseeks to understand education in its own terms, as the acquisition of academic\nknowledge and skills. This is not to deny the social context in which\neducation is given meaning; all knowledge is developed within a cultural\ncontext which frames ideas and concepts. Yet, at the same time academic\nor theoretical knowledge by its very nature becomes abstracted from the\ncontext in which it was produced. This is how we are able to see connections\nthat would otherwise remain hidden. Young (2008) depicts this as a\n‘social realist’ view of knowledge. Theoretical knowledge is social, but it\nalso has its own structure, form and central concepts.\nAmong others, the liberal, humanist tradition is associated with the\nwork of Oakeshott (1989) and Arnold (1869), who discussed education\nand being human as inextricably linked. Thus, Oakeshott (1967/1973)\ndescribed education as ‘the only way to becoming a human being, and to\ninhabit it is to be a human being’ (p. 158). Oakeshott saw the distinctive\ncontribution of schools to be ‘a place of learning’.\n168 A. Standish\n', 'In modern public schooling, the communities that provided the context\nfor education have included local communities or education authori-\nties, the nation state, religious communities and state government in the\nUSA. Each of these has given rise to a particular view of education\ngrounded in a given worldview. Common to all is a combination of social,\npractical and theoretical education. What is unique about education is its\ncapacity to engage young minds in ideas and worlds that are beyond their\neveryday experience. The distinction between everyday and theoretical\nknowledge is derived from Durkheim’s distinction between the ‘sacred’\nand ‘profane’ orders of meaning. Durkheim emphasised the collective\nnature of knowledge and ideas that are held by communities. This model\nwas later advanced by Basil Bernstein’s conception of horizontal (everyday)\nand vertical (theoretical) knowledge (Young, 2008). Vertical knowl-\nedge is hierarchical and abstract from particular contexts. It is only\naccessible through a system of concepts and ideas that must be learned to\nreach higher levels of comprehension. Vertical or theoretical knowledge is\ngenerated by specialist communities who focus on one particular field or\narea of knowledge. Thus, most, but not all, schools teach through a curriculum\nof subjects as a means of accessing disciplinary knowledge. Edu-\ncating children and young people through a broad subject-based\ncurriculum is central to liberal education which aims to free the mind\nfrom the limitations of personal experience and local context. Along with\nprogressive ideals, the liberal educational ideal has framed education and\nthe curriculum in the USA and England.\nWhat is global education?\nResearching global education is challenging because the term means different\nthings to different people. According to Walter Parker, the move-\nment for global education ‘solves a variety of problems, serves an array of\nmasters, and expresses diverse and sometimes conflicting values’ (Parker,\n2008, p. 202). Thus, Parker surmises that global education is characterised\nby a lack of coherence and a lack of precise terminology. Terms such as\nglobal education, international education, global learning, the global\ndimension and global citizenship are often used interchangeably. For the\npurposes of this article, the term global education is employed as a catchall\nfor the global approach, although differences between initiatives will\nbe addressed. A few examples will illustrate the different ways in which\nthe terms have been utilised.\nThe UK government report Developing the Global Dimension in the\nSchool Curriculum suggests that young people should be given opportunities\nto:\n[C]ritically examine their own values and attitudes; appreciate the similarities\nand differences between people everywhere; and value diversity;\nThe Curriculum Journal 169\n', 'understand the global context of their local lives; and develop skills that will\nenable them to combat injustice, prejudice and discrimination. Such knowledge,\nskills and understanding enables young people to make informed deci-\nsions about playing an active role in the global community. (Department for\nEducation and Skills, 2005, p. 2)\nIn the 2007 secondary national curriculum for England global learners\nare described as:\n\x01 Successful learners who enjoy learning, make progress and achieve.\n\x01 Confident individuals who are able to live safe, healthy and fulfilling\nlives.\n\x01 Responsible citizens who make a positive contribution to society.\n(Brown, 2010)\nReading these examples, one might be tempted to reach the conclusion\nthat global learning can mean almost anything: responsibility, citizenship,\ngood health, personal achievement, participation or making a living.\nIndeed, in recent years the term global has become an umbrella concept\nunder which different educational initiatives have coalesced, notes Hicks\n(2007a). Today, the term ‘global’ is often used in an inclusive sense,\nencompassing international education, sustainable development education,\nglobal citizenship education, twenty-first century skills, development\neducation, human rights education and other such ‘big concepts’. At the\noutset, we must recognise the different meanings of the word global.\nAccording to Oxford Dictionaries global means ‘relating to the whole\nworld, worldwide’ or ‘relating to or embracing the whole of something, or\nof a group of things’ (Oxford Dictionaries, 2011). While some use the\nword in its geographical sense, others emphasise the holistic or inclusive\nmeaning of the term (Hicks, 2007a; Marshall, 2005). This latter meaning\nof global has been adopted in many contemporary policy documents and\ncurriculum materials. A holistic or inclusive approach is often celebrated\ntoday as a way of breaking down traditional boundaries (between cultures,\nnations, everyday/academic knowledge, and education/social\nreform) that underpinned liberal education and disciplinary knowledge.\nOf particular significance, the inclusive approach opens education up to\ndifferent interpretations and alternative aims, blurring the line between\neducation and social causes, training for work or therapy.\nBreaking with the past\nTo begin, it is helpful to distinguish the rise of global education from\ninternational schooling. International schools have a long history dating\nback to the eighteenth century. Brickman (cited in Sylvester, 2007, p. 11)\nidentified 30 formal plans for international education between 1814 and\n1914, including Spring Grove School in west London (1866), the\n170 A. Standish\n', 'International School of Peace in Boston (1910), and international schools\nat Chatou near Paris and Bad Godesberg near Bonn. The year 1924 was\nalso important as this was the year in which the International School of\nGeneva was opened for children of parents working at the newly founded\nLeague of Nations.\nMost international schools are founded to serve an international\ncommunity. This was found to be the case when visiting Washington\nInternational School in Washington, DC, and Centre Academy School in\nLondon. Such schools provide ‘globally mobile expatriates with a cultural\nbubble by isolating their children’s educational environment from\nexposure to local culture’ (Hayden, 2006, p. 10). The Washington school\nserves a range of international families and offers both the International\nBaccalaureate and English examinations, while Centre Academy serves\nan American community in London and offers a dual curriculum. International\nschools frequently teach in English and serve children from a\nvariety of countries. Teaching in English is often the main attraction for\nparents who view English as an international language that will help their\nchildren in the global job market, and learning a second language is often\nviewed as an additional marketable skill.\nThe movement for global education is something quite different. Originating\nin the 1960s and 1970s, this field embraced the themes of interde-\npendence, development, environment, racism, peace and the future, as\nadvocated by social movements and NGOs (Hicks, 2007a). Global studies\nbecame a significant theme in American education during this period.\nSome of the founders of global education include Anderson (1979),\nBecker (1982) and Hanvey (1975/2004). Central to the global approach to\neducation was the notion that society had entered a Global Age in which\nthe human condition had become ‘globalised’. Coming at a time of vocal\nanti-establishment movements (anti-war, minority rights and proenvironment),\nglobal thinking expressed the view that nations needed a\nshift in attitude. Anderson argued that many trends in society were accelerating\nexponentially and could not be sustained. In his thesis on the Global\nAge, Anderson illustrates a number of ‘J’ curves to demonstrate the exponential\ngrowth induced by humanity, including fertiliser use, books pub-\nlished, circulation of money, speed of communication, atmospheric carbon\ndioxide, life expectancy, energy consumption and population. All of these,\nargued Anderson, had driven nation states to work together in ways that\nhad not been thought of in previous times; hence, the condition of humanity\nhad become globalised: we have been propelled together in time and\nspace to such a degree that our world system becomes interdependent. A\nsense of discomfort with the current state of affairs, and hence the need to\ncreate an alternate future, is a key part of the global outlook.\nBecker (1982) suggested that children need to learn about political, cultural\nand social themes in order to obtain a ‘global perspective’ (seeing the\nThe Curriculum Journal 171\n', 'world as a whole). In ‘An Attainable Global Perspective’ Hanvey (1975/\n2004) outlined five dimensions that could be used to teach children about\nthe ‘global condition of humanity’. These included perspectives consciousness\n(recognising that others have different viewpoints), state of\nplanet awareness (the dangers of exponential growth), cross-cultural\nawareness (recognising diversity of ideas and practices), knowledge of\nglobal dynamics (interconnectivity) and awareness of human choices\n(there are alternative futures).\nIn England, early projects for global learning and development education\nreceived backing from both governmental and non-governmental\nsources (see Lambert & Morgan, 2011). The World Studies Project\n(1973–1980) was launched by the One World Trust with financial support\nfrom Department of Education and Science, the Leverhulme Trust and\nthe Ministry for Overseas Development. The project’s aim was ‘to encourage\nmodification of syllabuses at secondary school level to reflect a world\nperspective rather than national attitudes’ (One World Trust cited in\nHeater, 1982, p. 220). This project was followed in the 1980s by World\nStudies 8–13, produced by the Schools’ Council and the Joseph Rowntree\nTrust. This program offered a multicultural approach to education and\naimed to develop international understanding. Lessons in world studies\nwere designed to help pupils cope with global issues, to clarify their own\nvalues, study cultures different from their own, and consider how the\nworld could be different. Simon Fisher recalls that world studies necessitated\nreflecting at different levels: ‘How would we like things to be in the\nworld as a whole, in our country, locally, for me?’ (Fisher, 1985, p. 31).\nBy the mid-1980s, ‘over half the education authorities in the UK were\npromoting world studies’ (Holden, 2000, p. 74) and many more teachers\nwere using resources produced by aid agencies and a growing number of\ndevelopment education centres.\nGlobal education is sometimes claimed not only by those who want to\nsurpass the national framework, but also by political and corporate elites\nseeking to promote national interests beyond their borders. In the USA,\nan International Education Act was passed in 1966, the main aim of\nwhich was to add international content to the curriculum. This Act was in\nkeeping with America’s growing international role and the perceived need\nfor citizens to be more aware of international issues and foreign policy. It\nwas during this period that National Resource Centres for Foreign Language,\nArea and International Studies were established. The Act was fol-\nlowed by a Task Force on Global Education. Launched by Commissioner\nEarnest L. Boyer, its remit was to examine the need for a global perspective\nin American schools. The task force reported that ‘global education\ncontributes to a fundamental competence in a world context, to educational\nexcellence, and to the nation’s vital interests’ (Office of Education,\n1979). Several States published guidelines for global or international\n172 A. Standish\n', 'education. For example, Education for a Global Perspective: A Plan for\nNew York State (1983) required pupils to take two years of global studies.\nEspecially in the US context, the expansion of global and international\nstudies during the 1980s was tied to its growing international role and also\nthe globalisation of markets. In the words of the late Samuel Huntington,\nthis was about ‘Merging America with the World’ (2004, p. 257).\nWe found that there are at least three rationales that underpin initiatives\nfor global/international education, which often connect personal\nidentity with projecting power beyond national borders: social/individual\nchange (global citizenship/projecting power/global perspective), economic\n(skills for the global market/projecting economic power) and occasionally\nacademic (knowledge about the world). The timing of the two waves of\nglobal education is no accident. The first movement (late 1960s and\n1970s) coincided with radical anti-war movements, campaigns for racial\nand gender equality and the rise of the environmental movement in the\nAnglo-American world. While there was something of a backlash against\nradical politics in the 1980s, Furedi (1992) notes that political elites never\nreally recovered from the challenges to their ideas and leadership. The second\nmovement (from the 1990s) parallels another period of social and\npolitical rupture: the end of the Cold War and the decline of the Left/Right\npolitical framework for societal organisation or transformation. This disconnection\nwith where we have come from is what gives rise to uncertainty\nabout the future and a search for alternative forms of meaning (La€ıdi,\n1998). It is within the context of the decline of national elites and their\nmodernist projects for national social and economic advance that alternative\nglobal thinking has become a part of mainstream education policy.\nGlobal education in the curriculum\nIn their report Global Dimension in Secondary Schools, Douglas Bourn\nand Frances Hunt found that in England ‘there is considerable variation\nin the ways in which the term “global dimension” is perceived and articulated,’\nand that, ‘Schools tend to personalise their interpretation and do\nnot directly follow national guidelines’ (Bourn & Hunt, 2011, p. 5). Our\nresearch echoed these findings, although we found some common assumptions.\nHere, examples from documentation, teaching materials and inter-\nviews are presented to illustrate the social construction of global\neducation (for a fuller discussion see Standish, 2012). This is divided into\nglobal knowledge, global skills and global ethics, although there is considerable\noverlap between each.\nGlobal knowledge\nThe starting point for global educators is to break with the past curriculum\ncentred on subject knowledge which is distrusted as an elite ‘tool of\nThe Curriculum Journal 173\n', 'modernity’ with ‘imperialistic roots’ (Mullar, 2000). Global knowledge is\noften presented as more inclusive of the voices and perspectives of minorities\nand children. For this reason, many global education resources\ninclude sections or boxes describing life or events from a range of perspectives.\nOne English example comes from the Geographical Association’s\n‘Valuing Places’ project. Pupils are asked to read and think for a moment\nabout the story of an illiterate man from Kenya who gets into difficulties\nwith his medicine bottle:\nSixty year old Chemjor Chapkwony from Kenya never had a chance to\nlearn to read. He tells of the effect that this has had on his life:\nI fell sick and was taken to hospital, where I was given medicine by the doctor.\nI took the medicine he gave me and went to find a place to sleep.\nIn the morning, the person I was staying with came to look for me and\nfound me unconscious. He took me to hospital.\nNow when I am given medicine, I am afraid to take it because I cannot read\nthe label. So I am afraid. (Oxfam website, cited in Development Education\nAssociation, 2004, p. 24)\nThe lesson outline suggests that using real people’s voices helps pupils\nto ‘appreciate, value, and view positively the differences and similarities\nwith their own lives’.\nWisconsin’s Planning Curriculum in International Education includes\nglobal connections alongside global cultures and global challenges as its\nthree strands of international education. Examples of global connection\nactivities include:\n(1) Environmental education\nPopulation density: Divide popcorn among children, who are arranged in\ngroups according to population. When some children get much and others\nget less, introduce concepts of global geography, continents and population.\nSee Zero Population Growth for curriculum materials and statistics.\n(elementary level)\nUrbanisation and megacities: Explain how motor vehicle use contributes to\nair pollution, global warming and ozone depletion. Identify actions that\nindividuals can take to reduce the environmental impact of motor vehicles.\nSee World Resources Institute activity ‘Car Trouble’. (high school)\n(2) Family and consumer education\nGlobal marketplace: Create and discuss projects to understand how consumer\nbehaviour constitutes voting in the global marketplace. Consumer\nEconomics: A Teacher’s Guide, modules 1.10–1.12.\nChoices for the 21st Century Education Project, Voting in the Global\nMarketplace curriculum unit. (middle or high school)\n174 A. Standish\n', '(3) Marketing education\nGlobal markets: Choose a specific product. Make a web map showing as\nmany interactions as possible, both negative and positive, that stretch\nacross at least four countries. Include product design, hiring, managing\nworkers, labour policies, production, waste productions, marketing, purchasing,\nand using, recycling and disposing of the product. (middle or high\nschool)\nWisconsin’s connections to global markets: Research ways in which local\ncompanies are connected by imports, exports, needs and services to countries\nabroad. (all levels) (Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction,\n2002, pp. 122–146)\nThese examples include a combination of knowledge (product and production\nwebs), simplistic devices (unequal handfuls of popcorn) and mor-\nalistic messages (consumer behaviour). Academically, there is much to be\nlearnt about the connections between local, regional, national and international\nscales. What is different about the global approach is the way in\nwhich phenomena and events in the world are presented as connected to,\nand thus the responsibility of, children. One American school teacher\nreflected on the importance of pupils taking action on global issues\nbecause ‘teaching knowledge is not enough’. Thus, global educators\nseemed to be aiming for something beyond the educational aim of developing\nknowledge and understanding of the world, including the ethical\ndimension. David Hicks explains, ‘Global education has long recognised\nthat any understanding of the contemporary world needs to be based on\nparticipatory and experiential ways of learning. It needs to involve both\nhead and heart (the cognitive and affective) and the personal and political\n(values clarification and political literacy)’ (Hicks, 2007b, p. 27). The\nimplication in these examples is that the global approach treats knowledge\nas a means for involving children in ethical pursuits that are both\nidentity forming and directed towards an external Other (see Global Ethics\nbelow).\nGlobal education discourse also emphasises a world characterised by\nrapid change and fluidity, where knowledge and skills need to be continually\nupdated. Global educators assert that young people need to learn to\nbe flexible, adaptable, willing to migrate and work with people of different\nculture; further, that they need to be able to update their knowledge and\nskills on a regular basis to keep up with new information and technological\nchange. In the opinion of Asia Society Director, Michael Levine,\n‘young people who understand the dynamics of global economic and\nintercultural relations will have a distinct advantage in securing good\njobs’, arising from ‘knowledge of world history, languages, global health\nand international affairs’ (Levine, 2005, p. 1). Here, the emphasis is placed\nupon knowledge that is of direct relevance to children in their everyday\nThe Curriculum Journal 175\n', 'lives; it is something that they will utilise for work, managing their lives,\nsocialising or for travel. This has led to increased emphasis on foreign languages,\nknowledge of other cultures, health education, global issues and\nglobal skills.\nPerhaps more so than other subjects, the place of foreign languages in\nAmerican and English schools reveals the gap between the innovative\nrhetoric of the need for global education and what is happening in\nschools. All global/international schools, teachers and policy documents\ndiscussed learning at least one foreign language as an imperative for\nyoung people today. Several schools had new initiatives to enhance the\nteaching of foreign language, with Mandarin being a common example.\nHowever, these must be viewed in the context of a broader decline in\nthe quantity and possibly also the quality of language teaching.\nIn England, a national initiative to enhance the place of foreign language\nteaching in the curriculum was launched in 2002: Languages for\nAll: Languages for Life: A Strategy for England. The strategy included\noffering foreign languages to pupils in primary schools, a new credit system\nfor language skills, increased opportunities for adults in higher educa-\ntion and workplaces, and new training opportunities for teaching a\nforeign language. By 2008, 92% of primary schools were teaching a\nforeign language and 69% were offering this throughout Years 3–6 (age\n7–11). This is approximately double the number of schools teaching foreign\nlanguages since the launch. However, the National Strategy only\nstipulates that schools must offer children an entitlement to foreign languages\nrather than requiring them to study it. Data on how many pupils\nhave been seizing the opportunity were not available and in many schools\npupils are offered only a basic introductory vocabulary rather than the indepth\nstudy of language and culture that is needed for fluency and com-\nprehension (Lawes, 2007).\nDespite the rhetoric about the importance of learning foreign languages\nin both the USA and England, the number of pupils studying\nlanguages is on a downward trajectory. In England, the decline of participation\nin foreign languages post-fourteen has been steep over recent\nyears: for Year 10 (age 14–15) declining from 48% in 2005 to 40% in 2009\nand for Year 11 (age 15–16) from 53% (2005) to 43% (2009) (National\nCentre for Languages/Association of Language Learning, 2009). In the\nprivate sector, things are different: 82% of schools require pupils to study\na foreign language up to age 16 (National Centre for Languages/Association\nof Language Learning, 2009).\nIn the USA, the story is similar. Survey data from the Centre for\nApplied Linguistics show that instruction in most foreign languages has\ndeclined over the past decade, with the exception of Mandarin (Dillon,\n2010). While there were tiny increases in the number of schools offering\nItalian and Hebrew, and the number offering Spanish remained\n176 A. Standish\n', 'unchanged, Greek, Russian, Japanese, Latin, German and French all\nexperienced a decline (between 0.3% and 18%) in the number of schools\noffering these languages. Therefore, the trend is towards less education in\nworld languages and culture than was the case a decade ago.\nGlobal skills\nSkills are not independent of knowledge. Skills are intimately tied to our\nexperience and knowledge. Yet, today, skills seem to have taken on a life\nof their own, sometimes even divorced from their owners. Both in\nAmerica and in England, policy-makers and politicians have argued that\nwe are now part of a new global or knowledge economy, which demands a\nhigher level of skills and knowledge of employees than a traditional economy\nwith a large manufacturing sector. ‘[I]n a knowledge economy, edu-\ncation is the new currency by which nations maintain economic\ncompetitiveness and global prosperity,’ asserts US Secretary of Education,\nArne Duncan (2010). The argument is that the outsourcing of manufacturing\nand some services to developing countries has reduced the need for\nrepetitive, low-skilled work in the West, and the comparative advantage of\ndeveloped economies is to concentrate on high-end and high-skilled work\nthat other countries cannot do. Countries such as the USA and England\nare discussed in terms of a post-industrial economy in which knowledge\nand skills rather than labour is the key to success.\nThis discourse has been paralleled by a growing emphasis on skills in\nglobal education discourse, including skills for employment, social interaction,\nlearning, thinking, managing emotions and relationships, citizen-\nship and research (see Table 1). This table of skills was compiled from\ncurricula, teaching materials, policy documentation and interviews. Many\nof these derive from a strong employability/global market rationale.\nTable 1.

The P21 gained significant momentum early in the\nnew century, with 16 states signing up to teach its skills framework. The\n‘learning skills’ include information and media literacy skills, communication\nskills, critical thinking and systems skills, problem identification, for-\nmulation and solution, creativity and intellectual curiosity, interpersonal\nand collaborative skills, self-direction, accountability and adaptability,\nand social responsibility. The interdisciplinary themes are global awareness,\nfinancial, economic, business and entrepreneurial literacy, and civic\nliteracy. Examples of P21 activities:\nFourth-grade Social Studies Lesson: work in small groups to discuss problems\nthat they have observed or heard about in their school such as bullying\nor graffiti. Convening as a whole class, students should come to some common\nagreement about the problems that are most meaningful. After the\nproblem has been selected by mutual consent, students take responsibility\nfor specifying elements of an inquiry into the causes and possible solutions\nto the problem.\nTwelfth-grade English Lesson: students translate a piece of dialogue from a\nShakespearean play into a text message exchange and analyse the effect of\nthe writing mode on the tone or meaning of the dialogue. Students then discuss\naudience and purpose in relation to communication media. (Partner-\nship for 21st Century Skills, 2009)\nWith both activities, which are typical of the scheme, the emphasis is\nplaced upon skills that have social utility rather than skills for developing\nintellect and knowledge. The fourth-grade lesson would engage pupils in\nproblem solving and communication. In the twelfth-grade lesson, an\nactivity based on Shakespeare’s writing has been turned into a lesson on\ncommunication. However, this teaches pupils little about Shakespeare’s\nwriting and the historical context under which it was produced.\nFollowing on from P21, the Common Core State Standards had been\nadopted by 46 states in 2012. Unlike P21, they have a more academic\nappearance because they are organised by subject and make note of the\nimportance of aligning skills with content knowledge. Nevertheless, by\nstarting with skills they have inverted the relationship between the two:\nknowledge has become a vehicle for learning skills rather than the other\nway around.\nThe main skills for global citizenship cited in documentation include\npersonal, social and emotional skills, skills for community participation\nand citizenship, and learning skills (Table 1). The main advocates for this\nskill set were progressive educators and NGOs.\n178 A. Standish\n', 'Personal, social and emotional skills can be sub-divided into practical\nliving skills, skills for managing relationships and skills for psychological\nwell-being. When skills become divorced from theoretical knowledge,\nthey tend to focus on the practical aspects of life and everyday social\nproblems. There were a number of global skills proposed that are associated\nwith managing relationships. These include how to deal with bully-\ning, conflict resolution, collaboration and negotiation, the ability to\ncompromise and be flexible, communication, and the ability to respect the\nbeliefs and values of others. Mostly, these skills are predicated upon the\ntype of individual that global educators are seeking to nurture, therefore\naligned with ethics. This is an individual who values cooperation over\ncompetition, is non-judgmental of different cultures and viewpoints, listens\nto others rather than asserting their position, and affirms rather than\ncritiques the contributions of others.\nAn example of skills for managing social relationships is taken from\nOxfam’s Global Citizenship: The Handbook for Primary Teachers (Oxfam,\n2002). The activity is called ‘Cooperation!’:\nAim: To encourage pupils to think about how difficulties can be resolved\nthrough compromise and cooperation.\nPut a PE hoop on the floor, and ask two children to stand in it facing opposite\ndirections. Put one apple on each side of the hoop, just out of reach.\nAsk the children inside the hoop to hold hands, pull in opposite directions,\nand try to reach their apple. Then ask other pupils to suggest why this is\nnot a good idea, and how the children in the hoop could each reach their\napples in a more cooperative way. The most obvious way is for the children\nto move together to pick up the apple first from one side and then from the\nother. (Oxfam, 2002, p. 47)\nA second example is called ‘River Crossing’ and comes from In the\nGlobal Classroom 2:\nStudents sit in a circle and each is given a card. The teacher explains that the\nlong line of mats is a river that everyone has to cross. If a student has a card\nwith a picture of crossed-out feet, they must cross the river without putting\nher feet in the water; similarly, if a student’s card shows crossed-out hands,\nhe cannot put his hands in the water. The teacher asks for suggestions on\nhow to get everyone across and selects students to try each one. When it is\nestablished that they need to be helped or to help others if everyone is to get\nacross, the class is given time to work out a plan. The teacher reminds the\nclass that this is not a winner-and-loser activity; success is achieved only\nwhen everybody is safely across the river. (Pike & Selby, 2001, p. 42)\nWithout a clearly defined relationship to subject knowledge, the skills\nagenda has transformed the meaning of education in the Anglo-American\nworld. Practical, vocational, personal and emotional skills, rather than\nThe Curriculum Journal 179\n', 'knowledge and intellectual skills, are being treated as ends of education.\nAs Williams (2005) observes, in fetishising skills they tend towards a commodity\nor a ‘tangible product’ for consumption. The British government\npromoted this view through documents such as Success for All (2002) and\n21st Century Skills (2003), suggests Williams.\nBut it was not always thus. Some decades ago skills were viewed either\nin terms of high-level educational qualifications and analytical capacities,\nor as ‘hard’ technical abilities necessitating physical dexterity, spatial\nawareness and technical know-how. Jonathan Payne recalls that when the\n1965 National Plan called for more skilled labour, it had in mind engineers,\nmathematicians, chemists, physicists, economists, computer pro-\ngrammers, mechanics and electricians (Payne, 2000, p. 355). In other\nwords, skills were achieved through hard work and the acquisition of\nknowledge. This contrasts with the mostly soft skills included in global\neducation materials. In fact, many ‘global skills’ are not skills at all, but\nrather competencies, attitudes, dispositions and behaviours. As with\nknowledge, when skills become global the very notion of a ‘skill’ becomes\nexpanded to something quite different from its previous meaning.\nGlobal ethics\nWhile the subject-based curriculum was focused on teaching the accumulated\nwisdom of the past and cultural traditions, global education is more\norientated towards creating an alternative future. For this reason it seeks to\nengage children in a discussion of contemporary issues that ‘facilitates\ndevelopment of the child’s sense of himself or herself as a personal and\nsocial being’ (Morris, 1979). Many global education activities are designed\nwith particular ethical perspectives in mind, but with a framework that is\nindividually referenced. For example, a representative for the NGO Reading\nInternational Solidarity Centre suggested that behind their educational\nresources and teacher training courses ‘it is the attitudes that matter most’.\nThis sentiment was echoed at one of its local partner ‘global schools’, where\nposters on the walls were making a case for ‘tolerance’ and ‘sustainability’.\nGeographer Alun Morgan provides an example of a lesson plan on\nsustainable development called ‘Probable and Preferable Futures’:\nStudents are asked to consider an issue. It may be one that relates to them\npersonally (e.g. their personal ambition) or to people collectively (i.e. the\ncommunity), and can operate over any spatial scale from the local (e.g.\nemployment, traffic issues) to the global (e.g. climate change). They then\ndraw a single time-line outlining crucial events relating the issue up to the\npresent, their time-line then forks into two branches. The probable (usually\nthe lower limb) is labeled with the likely events that would occur, given the\nexisting trajectory. The preferable (upper limb) is labeled with the events\nthat the student(s) would like to see happen. (Morgan, 2006, p. 279)\n180 A. Standish\n', 'When the timelines are complete, pupils are asked to discuss the different\ndecisions and actions that could lead society down each branch. ‘A\nmajor educational justification is that future education is more relevant to\nthe needs of young people and consequently is likely to be more engaging,\nthereby raising achievement through enhanced motivation,’ asserts Morgan\n(2006, p. 283). Morgan’s emphasis on the relevance of future education is\nintriguing as it implies that education about the past is somehow less relevant\nand motivating. What is less often discussed in global education litera-\nture is the relationship between the past, the present and the future, and\nhow we draw upon the past and the present to project into the future.\nA second example, Growing Bananas: a simulation about fair trade\nfor Key Stage 2–3 (age 7–14) was produced by Reading International\nSolidarity Centre (RISC, 2008). The lesson introduces pupils to the idea\nof fair trade:\n\x01 Organise students into groups of four or five.\n\x01 Each group of students represents a family, growing bananas in the\nWindward Islands.\n\x01 The simulating should run for at least three rounds, each round representing\na year of banana growing.\n\x01 At the start, each group should allocate a member to complete their\n‘balance sheet’\nDuring each round:\n\x01 The groups should use scrap paper to ‘grow’ bananas, by drawing,\ncolouring and cutting them out.\n\x01 Offer each group an event card from a selection of upturned chance\ncards (see below). They should respond to the information on their\ncard by entering it on their balance sheet.\n\x01 Once each group has an event card, announce that it is time to trade.\nEach group should deliver their completed bananas to the teacher/\nfacilitator, along with their chance card. Tell each group how much\nthey have earned (roughly $100 works best). They must then add or\nsubtract according to the instructions on their change card. Finally,\neach group decides how to allocate their money. (RISC, 2008, p. 1)\n‘Event cards’ are designed to alter the importance of different variables:\na change in market prices, ill-health in the family, extreme weather\nor other hazards. At the end of the activity teachers are encouraged to\ndebrief the class summarising ‘the importance of Fairtrade’ and ‘our\nimpact as consumers’ (RISC, 2008, p. 2). This teaching resource illustrates\nhow some global education materials are closely aligned with the aims and\nperspectives of their producers, in this case AgroFair, Banana Link and\nthe Fairtrade Foundation.\nThe Curriculum Journal 181\n', 'Frequently taught ‘global issues’ include poverty and malnutrition,\nenvironmental and ecological problems, equity, peace and conflict resolution,\nhealth, human rights, social justice, population growth, trade and\ntechnological change. The list of global issues reflects the work of NGOs,\nand also the United Nations (such as the UN Millennium Development\nGoals). Many NGOs, including UNICEF, publish teaching resources\nabout development and environmental issues, and also train teachers and\nstudent teachers to offer lessons in global issues. Therefore, global educators\ndo have in mind certain dispositions or values they hope children will\nembrace, and they design lessons accordingly. ‘Education constitutes the\ncentral pillar of strategies to promote such values’ reported the United\nNations International Implementation Scheme for the Decade (see\nPigozzi, 2006, p. 3). Heilman, 2009 found that global ethics were derived\nby a ‘white, liberal elite’ who wish to promote their own global agenda\nand their Western (global) institutions (p. 32). These values include tolerance\nof multiple perspectives, diversity, human rights, social and environ-\nmental justice, participation, peace, interdependence and respect for the\nenvironment. It is not necessarily the values in and of themselves that are\nproblematic, but the way in which they are employed to circumvent a discussion\nabout the moral basis of society.\nHere, education is redefined not as access to the authority of distinctive\nareas of knowledge or a particular culture with a moral framework, but as\nmeaning and identity for individuals derived from engagement with\nglobal issues, such as changing consumption habits to be more environmentally\nfriendly. What is limiting about such ethical actions is that they\nonly involve changing individual behaviour in response to predetermined\nnorms. They do not engage individuals in a collective project for social\nadvancement and neither do they promote debate about ethics. In fact,\nthey positively discourage individuals from putting forth one perspective\nor cultural norm as better than another, which has more to do with indifference\nthan genuine tolerance (Furedi, 2011).\nThe global citizen that these values aim to create is an emotivist self as\nEcclestone and Hayes (2009) explain: ‘The therapeutic is tolerant but\nindifferent to the Other so that external engagement or attachment is\ninstrumental to the internal therapeutic effort’ (p. 124). This is why Butt\n(2011) suggests that education has been reinvented as a private rather\nthan a public good. However, it is of course impossible to enter into a\nmeaningful discussion of ethics without a social basis for comparison.\nConclusion: in pursuit of meaning\nGraham Pike proposes, we should view global education as ‘in pursuit of\nmeaning’ (Pike, 2000, p. 64). This is a helpful way to make sense of the\nmovement and its ideas. This search for meaning characterises the\n182 A. Standish\n', 'discussion of globalisation and is indicative of a loss of former meaning\n(Laїdi, 1998). Under nation states education was tied to subject knowledge\nand national culture, both of which are less valued in the Global\nAge, in part because of their association with what is considered a discredited\npast. Advocates for global education are thus seeking an expanded\nmeaning of education that is not tied to the authority derived from subject\nknowledge and national culture. With global education the boundaries\nthat gave meaning to academic knowledge, skills and ethics in the context\nof education are being stripped away and new rationale are derived from\nsocial activities outside of academic education and culture. The question\nremains, what is left after this change has been made?\nWith the global approach, everyday knowledge and children’s own stories\nare valued alongside theoretical knowledge, skills have been expanded\nto include vocational, practical, personal, social and emotional skills and\nethics are now individually derived (in theory). This is a radically different\nvision of the type of individual schools are trying to nurture. This individual\nis a more practical being focused on managing different aspects of\neveryday living such as relationships, social situations, personal organisation,\nhealth, finances, communication, problem solving and participation.\nShe is also a more therapeutic being who reflects upon their personal values\nand behaviour. The emotive individual learns about global issues and\nthe perspectives of others, not to challenge or interrogate them, but rather\nto internalise the therapeutic ethic and gain meaning through projects to\nhelp a distant Other (Ecclestone & Hayes, 2009).\nIn one sense, global education can prepare children for our post-modern\nworld with its deflated notion of human subjectivity (Heartfield, 2002).\nHowever, what has been lost through challenging the boundaries that previously\ngave meaning to education is the idea of education as a transfor-\nmative process. The privileging of academic knowledge was tied to its\neducative potential. Theoretical knowledge is more powerful than everyday\nknowledge because of its explanatory power and also its practical\napplication. Theoretical knowledge is how we arrive at an understanding\nof how objects are related to each other, from which we can identify patterns\nof behaviour and theories about phenomena that are not intuitively\napparent from personal experiences. We do this by manipulating representations\nof objects and ideas in our heads. Moreover, it is because\nthought occurs at the abstract or theoretical level, in detachment from\nempirical connections tied to specific contexts, which allows ‘one to bind\ntogether things which sensations leave apart’ (Mullar, 2000, p. 79).\nFinally, it is theoretical knowledge, not everyday problems that provide\nfor a clearer projection towards somewhere we deem more desirable.\nWe conclude by questioning whether the global citizen ideal is possible\nwithout the boundaries that provide meaning to knowledge and culture.\nAfter all, making distinctions is the foundation of knowledge and also\nThe Curriculum Journal 183\n', 'basis of meaning (Mullar, 2000). This does not mean that boundaries are\nfixed, not porous, or that they cannot be crossed. However, when we transcend\na boundary it is important to understand why this is necessary. ‘To\ncross a line without knowing it is to be at the mercy of the power inscribed\nin the line,’ suggested Mullar (2000, p. 42). In fact, it is only with the help\nof boundaries that children are able to understand the truly global nature\nof both knowledge and culture. Without aiming for academic knowledge\nand a cultural framework of ethics, how are children to be prepared to\nmake sound judgments and actions in the world?\nAcknowledgements\nThanks go to Stephen Muffatti for research assistance.\nNotes on contributor\nAlex Standish is a lecturer in geography education and also author of several publications on\ngeography and education.
