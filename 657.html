J u d s o n  M i t c h e l l\nAssociate Professor of Political Science, University of New Orleans\nT\nh e  S o viet  U n io n  in 1974 presents a super\xad\nficially striking contrast to many Western dem\xad\nocratic regimes with their economic crises and \npolitical instability. Of course, domestic politics in \nthe Communist states does not feature the regular suc\xad\ncessions and alternations of democratic states; how\xad\never, the continuity of top- and mid-level political \nleadership in the Soviet Union since 1964 is excep\xad\ntional, even among the Communist regimes. As of \nmid-1974, the Soviet political elites seemed to be more \ncohesive than at any time since the end of the Stalin \nera. The leadership appears to have contained serious \nproblems of the economy and of dissent and there are \nindications of a widening “normalization” of Soviet \ninternal politics among important interest groups.\nThis summary view does not take into account the \nprofound critiques of the Soviet system offered by dis\xad\nsident intellectuals in recent years. Moreover, ques\xad\ntions must be raised concerning this apparent stability, \neven in terms of the regime’s own dominant values. \nDespite significant successes, chronic problems persist. \nIt can be argued that the apparent political stability \nis not only a mask concealing a fundamental immo\xad\nbilism—the inability to deal realistically and effec\xad\ntively with problems of social change associated with \nmodernization—but is also a major contributing fac\xad\ntor to such immobilism. Additionally, if the Soviet \npolitical system has indeed succeeded in large measure \nin achieving domestic stability prior to the attainment \nof communism, one must ask what are the effects on \na regime that is theoretically legitimized by revolu\xad\ntionary ideology. Whatever the degree of political \nstability actually produced, is it really the result of\n1 Pravda, February 14, 1974. p. 6; see Current Digest of \nthe Soviet Press, March 13, 1974, p. 1.\n2 Pravda, January 14, 1974, p. 4, and April 2, 1974, pp. \n3-4; Literaturnaya Gazeta. no. 3, January 16, 1974, p. 9 \nand no. 8, February 20, 1974, pp. 14-15.\nthe essential abandonment of revolutionary goals? If \nthis is the case, what sort of political order is emerging \nin the Soviet Union? An examination of the regime’s \nrecent record in dealing with major internal problems \nshould provide a basis for tentative answers to these \nquestions.\nSUPPRESSION OF DISSENT\nThe most spectacular action in the Soviet campaign \nagainst dissent, which had become increasingly severe \nduring 1972 and 1973, occurred in February, 1974, \nwith the expulsion of Alexander Solzhenitsyn from the \nSoviet Union and the revocation of his citizenship.1 \nAfter suffering years of petty official harassment and \ndenunciation by the Soviet press, Solzhenitsyn trig\xad\ngered the regime’s ultimate response by the publica\xad\ntion in Paris on December 28, 1973, of the first volume \nof The Gulag Archipelago, an account of terror in the \nStalinist forced labor camps. Translations appeared \nshortly in other Western languages and the book be\xad\ncame an international best seller; the Soviet press re\xad\nsponded predictably with violent denunciation of the \nauthor.1 2 Press attacks on August 1914, his earlier \nwork published abroad, had been almost as vitriolic. \nDenied permission to publish in the Soviet Union, \nSolzhenitsyn had, in fact, been made a celebrated dis\xad\nsenter to the Soviet public by the regime itself because \nof its crusade against him in official publications. In \nthe light of that degree of internal publicity, the ex\xad\npulsion of Solzhenitsyn was widely regarded in the \nWest as the mildest sanction that could have been im\xad\nposed without abandonment of the leadership’s hard \nline on dissent.\nSolzhenitsyn has been a rather solitary figure. The \nphysicist Andrei Sakharov, on the other hand, has \nbeen the central force in the Democratic Movement. \nSakharov’s prestige, both at home and abroad, has af\xad\nforded him unusual protection against reprisal in the\n155\n', 'past, but the move against Solzhenitsyn aroused spec\xad\nulation that Sakharov’s limited immunity might be \nshort-lived. In any case, Sakharov himself has in\xad\ncreasingly become an isolated protest figure. At the \nend of 1973, Sakharov’s Committee for Human \nRights had been virtually demolished by systematic \nrepression, and the loosely knit Democratic Movement \nappeared to be crushed by the arrests of virtually all \nimportant participants.\nNotable actions against dissidents since mid-1973 \ninclude the “ show” trial of Pyotr Yakir and Viktor \nKrasin in September, 1973, and the re-arrest of his\xad\ntorian Andrei Amalrik. Yakir and Krasin, former \nactivists in the underground press (samizdat), con\xad\nfessed at their trial and were treated leniently; they \nhave been allowed to live in exile near Moscow. \nAmalrik completed a three-year term in Siberia in \nJuly, 1973, and was sentenced to an additional three \nyears of confinement. The conviction was appealed \nand, in one of the rare instances of appellate modifi\xad\ncation in a political case, Amalrik’s sentence was com\xad\nmuted to exile.3\nWestern estimates place the number of political \nprisoners in the Soviet Union at about 10,000.4 Con\xad\nfinement in psychiatric institutions continues to be \nused as punishment on a selective basis against prom\xad\ninent dissidents; although, in testimony at the Yakir- \nKrasin trial, existence of this practice was formally de\xad\nnied by Professor Andrei Snezhevsky, director of the \nMoscow Institute of General Psychiatry.5 Civil rights \nactivists still subjected to this form of punishment as \nof June, 1974, included Leonid Plyushch, a key mem\xad\nber of the Committee for Human Rights during the \nearly 1970’s, and Yuri A. Shikmanovich, a former \nMoscow University mathematician. The most famous \nof all Soviet political prisoners, former Major-General \nPyotr Grigorenko, was released from a mental hospital \non June 26, one day prior to United States President \nRichard M. Nixon’s arrival for the summit confer\xad\nence, but this gesture did not mark a general soften\xad\ning of policy; in the week before Nixon’s arrival, more \nthan 30 Jewish civil rights activists were arrested in \nMoscow and other cities.\nDespite the severity of the campaign of repression, \nthere were some signs in the winter and spring of 1974 \nthat dissent remains alive in the Soviet Union. Im\xad\nmediately following Solzhenitsyn’s arrest, the poet \nYevgeny Yevtushenko dispatched a telegram of pro\xad\ntest to party General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. In \nApril, several dozen political prisoners in the labor \ncamps staged a hunger strike to protest the solitary\n3 Hedrick Smith, “ Soviet’s Internal Security Eased Since \nStalinist Era,”  The New York Times, January 13, 1974,\np. 26.\n*T h e  New York Times, January 13, 1974, p. 1.\n*T ass, August 30, 1973.\n6 The New York Times, May 19, 1974, p.

After a lapse of 19 months, in May, 1974, \nthree issues of the Chronicle of Current Events, prin\xad\ncipal samizdat publication of the Democratic Move\xad\nment, appeared.6 However, under current conditions, \na major revival of the virtually extinct underground \npress cannot be expected.\nPublic reaction abroad to Soviet internal repression \nhas been highly unfavorable, but this has had little \nadverse effect upon important foreign policy initia\xad\ntives, particularly the continuing detente with the \nUnited States. The case of the Kirov Ballet dancers \nValery and Galena Panov aroused widespread emo\xad\ntional protest in the West, but the Soviets resolved most \nof this tension in early June, 1974, by allowing both \nPanovs to emigrate to Israel. Nevertheless, the Bol\xad\nshoi Ballet met lively demonstrations on its subsequent \ntour in Britain. Earlier, the initial Western outrage \nover Solzhenitsyn’s deportation was moderated by an \nunexpected critical reaction to the author himself. \nGiven the chance to speak freely in the West, Sol\xad\nzhenitsyn revealed himself in interviews as a rather ex\xad\ntreme Russian nationalist, generally hostile to Western \nculture and technology. Additional controversy was \nprovided by publication of his 1973 letter to the \nKremlin leadership in which he had outlined his pro\xad\nposals for the future of the Soviet Union, advocating \nless advanced technology and concentration on the de\xad\nvelopment of a simple society in rural Siberia. Even \nSakharov broke with Solzhenitsyn after the letter’s \npublication. In a 3,500-word critique issued in April, \nSakharov criticized the “nationalistic and isolationist \ndirection of Solzhenitsyn’s thinking and the religious \npatriarchal romanticism characteristic of him.” Fur\xad\nther, Sakharov said that Solzhenitsyn’s ideas were \n“authoritarian” and could lead to “ the slavish lackey \nspirit that existed in Russia for centuries.” 7\nThe present disarray in reformist circles does not \nmean the end of Soviet dissent. Russia has a long his\xad\ntory of producing “superfluous men” among its intel\xad\nligentsia, and processes of modernization evidently \nyield a stratum of alienated intellectuals everywhere, \nregardless of social system. However, for the fore\xad\nseeable future the Soviet regime appears to have re\xad\nduced agitation for civil liberties to a minor problem. \nIt has been demonstrated that the kind of dissent pro\xad\npounded by the Democratic Movement, which has \nquestioned the very nature of the Soviet system, can \nbe silenced without undue disorientation of the gen\xad\neral pattern of social control. Furthermore, the or\xad\nganizational linkages essential for a broad Soviet pro\xad\ntest movement have been effectively destroyed by \nKGB (Committee of State Security) action and it is \nunlikely that the reform movement can recover struc\xad\ntural viability for some years to come.\nWhen assessing the effects on political stability of \nthe Soviet regime’s suppression of dissent, one should\n', 'Soviet Politics •  157\navoid evaluation exclusively from the perspective of \nWestern experience with political development. \n“Structural lag”—the tendency, for political institu\xad\ntions to change more slowly than the underlying social \nbase—is even more pronounced in the Soviet Union \nthan in Western democratic systems, because of Rus\xad\nsian traditions and the structural peculiarities of the \nSoviet socio-political system, still essentially totali\xad\ntarian. Moreover, the general level of political so\xad\nphistication is low by Western standards, even among \nthe intelligentsia. However, Soviet society is highly \norganized and is the most heavily bureaucratized so\xad\nciety in human history.\nThe interests of most Soviet citizens are articulated \nthrough massive bureaucratic structures; the most im\xad\nportant aspect of Soviet political stabilization is prob\xad\nably the development of regular processes of conflict \nresolution among major organized groups and effec\xad\ntive “satisfying” in decisional outputs related to their \ninterests. In other words, Soviet politics today is \noriented more toward bargaining and interest group \nactivity than toward attempting a revolutionary trans\xad\nformation.\nThe most impressive features in the record of the \nDemocratic Movement are its inability to make real \ninroads even among the intelligentsia and its almost \ntotal failure to establish linkages with other social \nstrata. This is not entirely a matter of official control \nof communications and coercive pressures by the re\xad\ngime. Sakharov and his associates have confronted a \nlarge measure of political apathy but they have also \nplaced themselves in opposition to the Soviet version \nof the “politics of consensus.”\nMost functional specialists in the intelligentsia are \nattached to the regime by their material interests; \nthey still constitute a privileged elite in Soviet society. \nThe working class has been increasingly tied to the \nregime, however tenuously, by the approach of the \n“economism” so repugnant to Lenin in his years of \nrevolutionary struggle—a primary emphasis upon ma\xad\nterial gains. While still well behind its counterparts in \nthe advanced Western countries, the Soviet working \nclass has made substantial improvement in its standard \nof living over the last 15 years. The party has largely\n8 See Ivan Dzhuba, Internationalism or Russification? \n(New York: Humanities Press, 1968) ; Edward Allworth \n(ed.), The Nationality Question in Soviet Central Asia \n(New York: Praeger, 1973); and Hedrick Smith, “ Ethnic \nRussians Are Settled Firmly in Central Asian Lands,” Inter\xad\nnational Herald Tribune, June 14, 1974, p. 6.\n9 See speech by G.

Even the peasantry \nappear to have been progressively integrated into the \npolitical system, at least in terms of passive com\xad\npliance. However, the strongest support for the re\xad\ngime comes from the Great Russians. Outside the \nRussian republic, the “politics of consensus” is rather \nfragile. The political integration of some of the \nsmaller republics into the general system has been \nheavily dependent upon the geographical dispersion \nof the Russians.8\nContinuation of consensual support for the system, \nso obscured in the West by the publicity accorded to \nintellectual dissent, appears to be mainly dependent \nupon the following; (1) continued success in pre\xad\nventing runaway mass expectations in regard to living \nstandards; (2) further rises in national and per capita \nincome and progress in closing the gap between Soviet \nand Western living standards; and (3) a reversal of \nthe regime’s recent poor record on the integration of \nsubordinate nationalities into the political system.\nPOLITICS OF NATIONALISM\nOne of the leadership’s chief aims in the campaign \nagainst dissent was the breaking of links between the \nDemocratic Movement and nationalist groups. This \nwas accomplished, but it has not prevented the con\xad\ntinuing resurgence of nationalism in most of the Soviet \nborderlands. Brezhnev’s close associate, Vladimir \nScherbitsky, party boss of the Ukraine, has apparently \nsecured the regime’s hold upon that republic for the \npresent, but anti-Soviet nationalism has probably not \ndiminished there among urban intellectuals and among \nWest Ukrainians generally. Azerbaijan9 and Georgia \ncontinue to be areas of extreme deviance from central \ngoals. Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a tough former \npolice official, was appointed first secretary of the \nGeorgian party in September, 1972, with the express \npurpose of stamping out nationalism, corruption, and \neconomic inefficiency. He proceeded to carry out a \nthoroughgoing purge of party and government ranks \nbut encountered extraordinary difficulties, including \nmass demonstrations in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi \nin June, 1973, and two attempts on his life. A report \nby Shevardnadze in Izvestia, April, 1974, indicates \nthat his relentless campaign has had little positive \neffect upon Georgian attitudes and behavior.10 1 De\xad\nspite widespread arrests of nationalists and civil rights \nleaders in Lithuania during 1972 and 1973, the per\xad\nsistence of strong anti-Soviet nationalism in that Baltic \nrepublic is candidly admitted by the authorities.”  \nOne recent indication of Soviet concern about na\xad\ntionalism in border areas is the rather bizarre turn\xad\nabout in the official interpretation of the historical \nrole of Tamerlane, who has become an important\n', "symbol of national identification among the Uzbeks \nof central Asia.12\nWhen critical manifestations of non-Russian na\xad\ntionalism appear, the leadership always concentrates \nupon the reassertion of central party authority and \ncoercive power; given the underrepresentation of most \nsubordinate nationalities in the party apparatus and \nmembership, this may intensify the long-range prob\xad\nlem. Moreover, the effective integration of Soviet \nnationalities is dependent upon socio-economic factors \nthat are untouched by ideological and coercive cam\xad\npaigns. The official report on plan results for the first \nquarter of 1974 indicates that the economic gap be\xad\ntween the Russian republic and other areas may be \nwidening rather than closing.13 14 Furthermore, al\xad\nthough minority nationalities have made advances in \nabsolute terms, the announced plan results conceal a \ncontinuing economic disparity between urbanized, \nmore highly educated Russians and indigenous popu\xad\nlations in the borderland republics.\nOne must conclude that nationalities’ problems, not \nthe limited intellectual dissent in Soviet cities, at \npresent constitute the weak link in the regime’s “ poli\xad\ntics of consensus.”\nECONOMICS AND POLITICS\nThe recovery of the Soviet economy from the down\xad\nturn of 1971-1972 was certainly most impressive, par\xad\nticularly in the agricultural sector, where output in \n1973 increased 14 percent, with a record grain harvest \nof 222.5 million tons.1'* The general upsurge con\xad\ntinued during first quarter 1974, with industrial pro\xad\nduction reportedly up 8.3 percent over the previous \nyear. An appraisal of the effect of economics on \nSoviet political stability requires a look at trends ob\xad\nscured by the overall quantitative advance. Most im\xad\nportantly, the economic picture for the working class, \nthe key element in the “politics of consensus,” in\xad\ncludes certain vulnerabilities.\nThe Soviet working class has definitely improved its \nstandard of living, but much of its current support \nfor the regime rests on unfulfilled promises. A “con\xad\nsumer revolt” against shoddy goods has been in pro\xad\ngress for some years; the waste involved in unsold \ninventories detracts significantly from capital accumu\xad\n158 •  C U R R E N T  H IST O R Y , OCTOBER, 1974\n12 Hedrick Smith, “Tamerlane Embroiled in Soviet Con\xad\ntroversy,” The New York Times, June 2, 1974, p. 2.\n13 Prauda, April 21, 1974, p. 1.\n14 See Report of the Central Statistical Administration, \nPravda and Izvestia, January 26, 1974, pp. 1-3 (reprinted \nin Current Digest of the Soviet Press, February 20, 1974, \npp. 14-22).\n15 Izvestia, April 23, 1974, p. 4.\n16 See Brezhnev’s speech to the 17th Komsomol Congress, \nPravda and Izvestia, April 24, 1974, pp. 1-2 (reprinted in \nCurrent Digest of the Soviet Press, May 22, 1974, pp. 1-8).\n17 Izvestia, March 16, 1974, pp. 1-2.\n1R Pravda, February 7, 1974, p. 2, and February 8, 1974, \nP. 2.\nlation, already probably inadequate for future sus\xad\ntained growth. The quantitative production targets \nfor the consumer sector set at the outset of the current \nfive-year plan have had to be revised downward, yet \nlight industry failed to meet its production goals in \nMarch, 1974.15 Brezhnev has indicated that quality of \nproduction will be the economic objective of highest \npriority for the near future16 and this is indeed essen\xad\ntial for the consumerist orientation. But real progress \nin this area would lower the present high propensity \nto save, make wage rates more meaningful, and \nprobably increase pressures for incentive rises in \nwages in all sectors of the economy. In any case, the \ngreater the movement for development of remote \nregions, the larger will be labor costs relative to output \nin the short run, given the necessary premium on \nskilled labor in those areas and the low initial returns.\nSoviet experience indicates that the importation of \nWestern technology will not rapidly yield higher pro\xad\nductivity and lower unit costs of production. Such \nprojects as Brezhnev’s ambitious scheme for opening \nup the non-black soil regions of the Russian republic \n(considered necessary for agricultural self-sufficiency)17 \nand the economic development of Siberia (essential \nfor meeting the energy requirements of future indus\xad\ntrial growth)18 demand heavy investment at the out\xad\nset and continuing higher costs of production than \npresently obtain in the developed areas. Foreign in\xad\nvestment will help, but the brunt of the cost must be \nborne by the Soviet consumer. Whatever the long- \nrange benefits for economic growth and diffusion of \nnational income, in the short run the complex equa\xad\ntion involving labor costs, productivity, investment, \nand output bodes ill for consumptionist policies.\nIt now appears probable that, by 1980, Nikita \nKhrushchev’s scheduled date for the completion of \nthe foundations of Communist society, the Soviet \nUnion will face an economic situation qualitatively \nsimilar to the inflationary crunch experienced by \nWestern capitalist economies in 1973-1974. Rises in \nreal costs of production and demands for goods and \nservices will probably not have been met by a cor\xad\nresponding increase in output, and real per capita \nincome will decline, Soviet living standards not having \nreached Western levels. If this occurs, the economic \nbasis for the regime’s “ politics of consensus” will suffer \na shattering blow. Such an outcome would be ren\xad\ndered improbable if the economy could approach \nWestern levels of efficiency during this decade. But \ngiven the system’s apparently low capacity for in\xad\nnovation and adaptation and the political leadership’s \ncautious approach to fundamental economic reform, \nprospects for such an internal transformation are dim \nindeed.\nIn 1973-1974, there was growing Soviet concern \nwith the social problems that have been connected \nwith rapid and uneven modernization in the United\n", 'Soviet Politics •  159\nStates and other Western countries. In February, \n1974, the Supreme Soviet issued a new gun control \nlaw, providing five years’ imprisonment for unauthor\xad\nized possession of firearms; this was in response to a \nrising incidence of crimes of violence, most notably in \nthe southern republics. In May, the Supreme Soviet \ndecreed stifT penalties for the illegal possession or \nsale of narcotics; this reflected official distress over \nrising drug abuse among Soviet youth, particularly \nthe use of marijuana and hashish. The official press \ncalled for vigilance against the incursion of Western \n“counter-cultural” influences among Soviet young \npeople, especially in the borderland republics.\nAlcoholism, of course, continues to be the greatest \nsingle social problem. The sweeping campaign \nagainst overconsumption of vodka launched in June, \n1972, appears to have had little effect, and alcoholism \nis so widespread that it may well be the single most \nimportant contributor to low labor productivity. A \nregime spokesman admitted in a February, 1974, \narticle that alcoholism is growing, that it is rising \nfaster among women than among men, and that it \ncan no longer be attributed to bourgeois influences or \nsurvivals of Czarist society.19\nWhile the Soviet Union still ranks far behind the \nUnited States in the incidence of overt disorder and \nsymptoms of social disintegration, it is clear that there \nis a high level of individual alienation that cannot \nbe directly expressed in the political system. A basic \nreason for this underlying alienation is that Soviet life \nfor most people is both hectic and dull; there are \nheavy pressures upon the individual and inadequate \nmeans for apolitical release of tensions. The leader\xad\nship recognizes the general problem and has sought to \nutilize various means to correct it, but the main thrust \nof the regime’s approach has been state sanctions \nagainst anti-social conduct and an attempted ideologi\xad\ncal revitalization of society by the party emphasizing \nthe morality of the “new Soviet man.”\nSoviet society has obviously lost most of its earlier \nrevolutionary dynamism, both internally and extern\xad\nally.

How\xad\never, given the underlying problems of alienation, the \nslowness of national integration, and low technical \nefficiency, the continuation of present levels of \nachievement is heavily dependent upon a renewed \nenergizing of the central directive force, the Com\xad\nmunist party.\nThe development of massive and competing bureau\xad\ncratic structures has given Soviet society an unparal\xad\nleled technocratic visage; at the same time, it has \nactually increased party power. As the most pervasive \nsocial structure and, theoretically, as the sole bearer of \nlegitimacy in the system, the party is the only agency \nthat can effectively perform the essential “arbitration” \nfunction and regulate conflicts among the huge \nbureaucratic structures.20 As temporary stabilization \nis secured in various problem areas, dependence upon \nthe party in subsequent decision making appears to \ngrow and its central functional role in the system \nexpands. Moreover, insofar as anomic and reformist \ndeviance threatens the general system of bureaucratic \ncontrol, the party’s role in suppressing dissent gives it \nadditional power over other organized interests.\nAll of this apparently requires a reassurance of the \nfoundations of party legitimacy, resulting in Brezh\xad\nnev’s campaigns for the re-ideologizing, of party and \nsociety. There is obvious concern that increased con\xad\ntacts with bourgeois regimes will lead to a diminution \nof party legitimacy; this concern is reflected in re\xad\npeated denials of the possibility for “convergence” of \nsocial systems21 and in the insistence that “ peaceful \ncoexistence” policy makes necessary an increase in the \nintensity of ideological struggle.22\nThe ideology has changed to reflect the evolution \nof Soviet society and the organizational interests of \npolitical elites amid the complexities of ongoing pro\xad\ncesses of modernization. Soviet ideologists now con\xad\ntend that both state and party will increase in strength \nright up to the inception of communism and that \nfunctional specialization will continue into the stage \nof communism. In other words, Soviet ideology cur\xad\nrently provides for the submergence of the “ sub\xad\nstructure”  into the “superstructure,” a startling in\xad\nversion of the original Marxian vision.23 *25 The concept \n(Continued on page 182)\nR.

The Soviet \nmilitary sees weapons’ innovation as a never-ending \ndialectic spurred on by both enemy capabilities and \nthe push of “ technological imperatives.” “The supply \nof technology cannot stand still, any more than the \ndevelopment of the military art can. This is especially \ntrue now, when there is stormy renewal and perfection \nin all spheres of human activity, including military \naffairs.” 17\n(5) The army also wants the propagation, by all \navailable means, of military and “military-patriotic” \nvalues—in an increasingly complex society that has \nnot gone to war in a generation. Military leaders \nfrequently demand greater coverage of military themes \nin the Soviet media, criticize artists, other intellectuals, \nand even official agencies for insufficient respect for \nmilitary ideals, and organize public relations projects \ndesigned to improve the military’s image, especially \nin the eyes of Soviet youth.\nClearly, these expressions of opinion and the policies \nto which they are addressed are important. Yet it is \nalso clear that individual policy questions must be \nevaluated in the context of ongoing stability in the \narmy-party relationship. Barring unforeseen develop\xad\nments, the Soviet military establishment is unlikely to \npose any major challenge to existing political arrange\xad\nments. Its political participation is confined within \nreasonably clear limits, and it shows no signs of over\xad\nflowing them and inaugurating an era of praetorianism \nor even the kind of military guardianship that char\xad\nacterizes Mao’s China.

But it is also an integral part of an es\xad\ntablished political order that shows no evidence of \ndecay or major reform. |\n17 A. Milovidov, “Leninizm—ideinaia osnova politiki \nKPSS,” ibid., 1971, no. 18, p. 17.\nSOVIET POLITICS\n(Continued from page 159)\nof the “new Soviet man” has been largely emptied of \nits anarchistic content and has become a prescription \nfor a nondescript secular morality attuned to the \npressures for compliance on “organization men” and \nthe popular demand for social peace. This ideological \nrevisionism accords more closely with the realities of \nSoviet society than the earlier revolutionary model, \nand it explains more adequately the growing centrality \nof the party’s role. But it remains to be seen whether \nthis increasing emphasis upon a revised ideology can\n24 See John A. Armstrong, Ideology, Politics, and Gov\xad\nernment in the Soviet Union, 3d ed. (New York: Praeger, \n1974), ch. 4.\nprovide the value commitment to energize the pro\xad\ncesses of modernization and integration.\nThe party, particularly the apparatus, has aug\xad\nmented its elite status during the Brezhnev years. \nGenerally greater security for mid-level elites has pro\xad\nduced pronounced increments in intra-party cohesion, \nbut security has had its price: political initiative “ from \nbelow” is discouraged in an apparatus that resembles \nan American corporate giant more than a revolution\xad\nary party. Efficiency at the lower levels is encouraged \nby advances in technological training of cadres and by \nthe “permanent purge,” which is accentuated by the \nexchange of party cards, scheduled for completion by \nthe end of this year. But the leadership is aging, and \nthe mobility of younger cadres has been impeded. \nMore than 55 percent of the Central Committee \nmembers are over 60 years of age; only ten percent \nare below 50.24 When Brezhnev passes from the \npolitical scene, he probably will be replaced by a \nleader or leaders heavily committed to his policy \norientation. But the new leadership will be dependent \nupon younger lieutenants who are now victims of \nintra-party “ immobilism” ; these men will have more \ntechnical expertise than their predecessors but much \nless political experience in positions of high respon\xad\nsibility.\nIt is significant that the Communist party of the \nSoviet Union has expanded its central role in Soviet \nsociety during the confrontation with the serious in\xad\nternal problems of the early 1970’s. Given the absence \nof structural alternatives, growth of this central role \nis likely to continue; even severe systemic crises would \nhave to be resolved through the party mechanism. \nHowever, the Brezhnevian pattern of social control \nhas concealed and abetted a very real immobilism, \nboth political and economic, in Soviet society. A \nheavy price may be exacted in the future for the \nabsence of more radical and more effective solutions \nto persistent general problems. But one must also \ntake account of the relationship between domestic and \nforeign politics. Despite United States Secretary of \nState Henry Kissinger’s spectacular diplomacy, the \nreality of Soviet power in world politics becomes \nsteadily more impressive. If the Soviet Union \nemerges, perhaps by default, as the world’s greatest \nsuperpower, this will have a decisive impact on \ndomestic stabilization, and Brezhnev’s conservative \nleadership will be largely vindicated. ■\nCONTEM PORARY SOVIET SOCIETY\n(Continued from page 176)\nfor advancement, education, access to housing, per\xad\nmission to live in the desirable cities—all these may be \njeopardized by opposition to the regime.
