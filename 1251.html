GROSS.\nNo ono who Is fnmilinr with tho way\nroad work hns been handled for tho\nlam twonly years will disputo that\nhalf of, tho tlma a\'nd money oxnonded\nupon our public roads by the hit and\nmls methods employed has boon\nwaited.. Most observers will say the\nwaste Is even greater. The country\nover, the outlay approximates 90,000,\n000. Wo have gone on from genera\ntlon to goneratlon pursuing: this nb\nBitnl plan, or rather lack of plan. It\nIs a most unbusinesslike! and repro\nhonnlble proceeding. No business en\nterprise could last a year with such a\nfearful waste. A calculation made\nwith great caro by one of the best au\nthorities in tho state, contends the di\nrect waste on Illinois roads by doing\nf-sn\nCountry School. House op Bad Road, Near Conklln, Tenn.\nIt would be harfl to llnd it greater contrast thn tin two pfrturos In this .trtiol\nhow. They are only a few inlloa upnrt. In ono there is nn air of ahlftlesHncca,\nwhile in the other thero Is evidence of thrift, progress and refinement. Can any ono\ndoubt which is the better school or which community gets the most out of llfo.\nthe wrong thing, or If porclumco do\ning the right thing, then doing it nt\ntho wrong time, causes a loss of $10,\n,000 per day!\nIn no dopnrtinont of administration\nhavo wo ifioro signally failed thnn in\ndealing with the quostion of the high\nways. It is time\' to face about and\nmako on effort to get better results.\nIs It any wonder people are "sore"\nwhon it comes to paying road taxes?\n.They have been at it for generations\nnnd with here and there an exception,\ntho roads nre no bettor than they were\nto begin with.\nThe question now is whnt Epeclfic\nthings shall be done in order to get\nbettor results. The first step in the\nwriter\'s opinion is to wipe out the\nlabor system of "working out" the tax\nby tho annual picnic or tnlkfest, that\nusually takes place in the early fall\nwhen everybody turns out to "im\npfoic\' tho road. Thore is no definite\nplan; the practice is to plow and\nscrape, and fill the center of tho road\nwith sod, \'weeds, brush and earth,\nninklng what beforo was a poSsable\nroad ono that is impassable. The Into\nncBs of tho season prevents a proper\nsettlement before the heavy fall rains\nand tho winter Eets in. The weeds,\nsod and biush arc suro to make trou\nble for a year or more. Many a time\nthe writer has observed a bunch of\nmen and teamB do a hundred dollars\'\nTorth of damage to work out a fifty-\nCedar Grovo School House, Near Knoxvillc, Tenn.\ndollar road tux. The storlos told, tho\nEtunts of wrestling, Jumping and other\nnthlotlc diversions, mako it a holiday,\nenjoyed by every one.\nThere in hut ono thing to do: Col\nlect all the road taxes in cash and pay\n\' to have the work done under tho host\nsupervision obtainable.\nThis working out the road tax dutos\nhack beforo tho war, when there was\nvery little money In circulation, and it\nwas next to impossible for the people\nto pay tho tax in any other way. It\nIs differont now. The labor system\nhas outlived its uaefulness and should\nSO.\nRoad building, oven 1 a dirt road,;\nrequires considerable engineering ex\nperience the fanner does not and Is\nnot expected to have. It Is no reflec\ntion upon him to say he Is not a ic\ncessful road bulkier nny more than\nit would be to question his ability in\ncarpentry. To have tho best supervi\nsion the township or road district is\ntoo small a unit. The mileage is too\nlimited to make It, practical to have an\nexperienced road builder in charge.\nHence the present thought is that the\ncounty should bo the road district, or\nperhaps there m!ght ho two districts\nIn large counties. The road super\nvlfor should be a capable, experienced\nengineer employed by tho year, or tho\ni searcn. Let him get the necessary\ntools, men and team and do the work\nwhen it ought to be. done. When grad\ning Is necessary, the earlier in tho\nspring It Is done tho bettor. The sur\nface ought not to be disturbed aftor\nthe first of July.\nThe first and most important step\nIstoiuI drainage. No drain, no road.\nIt is exceedingly important to haro\nono in charge who knows his business.\nAs road drainage will be treated at\nlength in another article, the writer\nwill not elaborate upon it at this time.\nThe drains can be laid at any season\nwhen tho frost Is out of the ground.\nCulvorts can bo built, the ronds drog\nged, weeds cut, etc. This will givo\nwork from oarly spring until fall.\nWith the county as a unit, plan n\nfive-year campaign of grading and\ndraining, beginning with tho main\nrt s and extending the work in tho\n- V t\norder of Importance. In a county of\nten to fifteen townships, one good en\ngineer with three or four gangs ol\nmen with machinery, each having a\ngood foreman, in three or four roars\nwill make such a showing, that people\nwill wonder they ever tolerated tho\nold hit and miss methods.\nIT tho method suggested was adopt\ned and followed, It would at least dou\nble tho resulttttor the taxes now paid.\nBy having regular employment; both\nthe men and horses would become\nproficient and do mora In a day than\ntho "greenhorn" would do in two days,\nand the work- will be far better done\nas woll.\nThe above outline is for tho treat\nment of earth roads. When tho time\nconies, nnd come It will, when tho\nmain roads will have to have a hard,\n?mooth wearing surface of stone,\ng:?vol or brick; all of the work pre\nviously done as above set forth, will\nbe valuable as a preparation for tho\npermanent road.\nThe inauguration of such a plan will\nappeal to the people; thoy will see\nhey nre getting something for the\nmoney paid. Their attitude will\nchange from ono of hostility to friend\nly co-operation, nnd this is of much\nImportance. The writer once saw ar\nenterprising farmer who had a road\ndrag? Ho took it out In a rain storm\nand dragged a mile of road, goljg\ntwice over it until It was ir his lan-\ncuage as smooth as n ribbon. No\ncooner had ho turned in under cover\nthan ho saw a neighbor with two\nteams coming down over the road, un\ndoing all ho had done. The comment\nmade would not lo,ok woll in print.\nIf the party in question had anv ap\npreciation of the ntness of thing, ho\nwould have driven along the tide of\nthe roRd, and loft the dragged Furfac?\nto it would shed water and dry\nsmooth. A five-dollar fine with -osts\nwould have been a good lesron.\nTho sentiment Is everywhere for\nbottor highways.
