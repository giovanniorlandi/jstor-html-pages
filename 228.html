        <pre>['Jo..,fIDI of Glacioloo, Vol. 14, No. 70, 197~ \nTHE FORMATION OF BRINE DRAINAGE FEATURES IN \nYOUNG SEA ICE· \nBy LARS INGOLF EIDEt and SEE LYE MARTIN \n(Department of Oceanography WB-IO, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, \nU.S.A.) \nABSTRACT. Laboratory experiments on the growth of sea ice in a very thin plastic tank filled with salt \nwater, cooled from above and insulated with thermopane, clearly show the formation and development \nof brine drainage channels. The sea-water freezing cell is 0.3 cm thick by 35 cm wide by 50 cm deep; \nthe thermopane insulation permits the ice interior to be photographed. Experimentally, we observe that \nvertical channels with diameters of 1 to 3 mm and associated smaller feeder channels extend throughout \nthe ice sheet. Close examination of the brine channels show that their diameter at the ice-water interface is \nmuch narrower than higher up in the ice, so that the channel has a "neck" at the interface. Further, oscillations\noccur in the brine channels, in that brine flows out of the channel followed by a flow of sea-water up \ninto the channel. Theoretically, a qualitative theory based on the difference in pressure head between the \nbrine inside the ice and the sea-water provides a consistent explanation for the formation of the channels, \nand the onset of a convective instability explains the existence of the neck. Finally, an analysis based on the \npresence of the brine-channel neck provides an explanation for the observed oscillations. \nRESUME.

Die Gefrierzelle fur das Meerwasser ist 0,3 cm breit, 35 cm lang und 50 cm tief; \ndas Eis im Inneren kann durch die Thermopane-Isolierung hindurch photographiert werden. Im Experiment\nlasst sich beobachten, dass vertikale Kanale mit Durchmessern von 1-3 mm und dazugehorige kleinere \nSeitenkanale sich durch die gesamte Eisschicht erstrecken. Bei naherer Betrachtung der Solekanale ist zu \nerkennen, dass deren Durchmesser an der Grenzflache zwischen Eis und Wasser viel kleiner ist als weiter \noben im Eis, dass also der Kanal an der Grenzflache einen "Flaschenhals" besitzt. Es zeigt sich weiterhin, \ndass in den Solekanalen Schwingungen stattfinden derart, dass einem Ausfluss von Sole aus dem Kanal ein \nEindringen von Meerwasser nach oben in den Kanal folgt. Eine qualitative Theorie, die auf der Druckdifferenz\nzwischen del\' Salzsole im Eis und dem Meerwasser beruht, licfert eine folgerichtige Erklarung ftir \ndie Kanalbildung; die Annahme einer konvekliven Instabilitat erklart das Vorhandensein der Verengung. \nSchliesslich liefert eine Analyse, die von dem Vorhandensein del\' Kanalverengung ausgeht, eine Erklarung \nfUr die beobachteten Schwingungen . \nINTRODUCTION \nBeginning with the great polar expeditions of the last century, observers have noted that \nsea ice is much fresher than sea-water. For example, both the field observations of Malmgren \n(1927) and Weeks and Lee (1962) , and the unpublished laboratory investigations ofG. F . N. \nCox (private communication in 1973) , show that the salinity of young sea ice decreases \nfrom roughly 20%0 immediately after its formation to 5%0 after a period of 2 to 4 weeks. \n• Department of Oceanography, University of Washington, Contribution No. 311; Department of Atmospheric\nSciences, University of Washington, Contribution No. 768. \nt Now at Vassdrags- og Havnelaboratoriet, Kl rebuveien 153, 7000 Trondheim, Norway. \n137 \n', 'JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY \nBecause much of the brine inside of sea ice is contained in small brine pockets, Whitman\'s \n(1926) theory of brine pocket migration was long thought to explain how sea ice lost its salt. \nUntersteiner (1967), however, pointed out that the pocket migration is far too slow to account \nfor the observed changes in salinity, and suggested that "brine expulsion" and "gravity \ndrainage", both of which we define below, account for the rapid decrease in salt content. \n"Brine expulsion" occurs when the temperature of the brine pockets decreases, which \ncauses some of the brine to freeze. Because the specific volume of ice is approximately 10% \ngreater than that of water, freezing increases the pressure inside the pocket, thus presumably \nforcing some of the brine from the pocket. In "gravity drainage", the greater weight of the \nbrine relative to that of the sea-water tends to drive the brine out of the ice, thus causing the \ngenerally observed absence of salt above the water-line (see Untersteiner (1967) and Cox and \nWeeks (1974) for examples). Both expulsion and gravity drainage require interconnected \ntubes or channels through which the brine can drain. Bennington (1963, 1967) and Lake and \nLewis (1970, hereafter abbreviated LL) observed such brine channels in field investigations, \nbut at the present time, there has been neither a detailed laboratory nor theoretical study of \nhow these channels form. \nIn the present paper, we describe a laboratory study of the drainage of young sea ice \nwhich yields a qualitative theoretical model of the formation and evolution of brine drainage \nchannels. Because of brine pockets, sections of sea ice with a thickness greater than about \nI cm are translucent. Therefore, to study the formation of drainage channels, using the \napparatus described in the next section, we grew an ice sheet with a width of 35 cm, a depth \nof up to 50 cm, but a thickness of only 0.3 cm, so that we were able to see through the ice and \nto photograph the development of the brine drainage channels. Our observations yielded the \nunexpected result that once the channels form, the flow in them is oscillatory in that first \nbrine pours out of the channel, then sea-water flows up into the ice, and so forth. \nFollowing the discussion of our observations, we present a qualitative model for the formation\nof the observed brine channels based on gravity drainage; a model suggested by Rothlis-\nberger\'s (1972) and Shreve\'s (1972) (hereafter abbreviated as Rand S) models for the drainage \nof temperate glaciers. We finally show that the geometry of the brine drainage channels is \nsuch that the channels are unstable to oscillations similar to those observed. \nTHE EXPERIMENT \nFigure I is a schematic diagram of our apparatus. The inner freezing cell, which was \nbuilt from 1.3 cm thick sheets of clear acrylic plastic ( "Plexigla~"), ha~ a width of 35 cm, a \ndepth of 50 cm, and a thickness of only 0.3 cm. Besides making the ice transparent, this \nparticular choice of cell thickness meant that the ice sheet was several dendrite diameters \nthick, so that triple grain boundaries occurred inside the ice. We insulated this cell with \n3.75 cm of dry air divided into six vertical concentric layers on the thermopane principle \ndescribed in Grober and others (1961). \nAt the top of the cell, cold alcohol circulated through a square copper tube insulated with \npolyurethane. As we show below, the growing ice sheet and the "Plexigla~" have similar \ntransient thermal properties. For this reason, the copper tube extended over both the water \nand the plastic of the box. To smooth out thermal irregularities in the tube, a 0 .3 cm thick \ncopper plate extended 4 cm from the bottom of the tube into the cell. The sea ice grew from \nthe bottom of this plate. At the bottom of the cell, drainage holes provided for an overflow \ntube, the introduction of dye into the cell, and the replacement of the dense brine generated \nby the ice growth with sea-water. During an experiment, to minimize both conductive and \nconvective heat transfer from the ice, we placed the entire apparatus in a cold dark room at a \ntemperature of -1.50 C. We filled the cell with a 32%0 NaCl solution, hereafter called seawater,\nwhich has a freezing temperature of - 1.80 C. When the sea-water had cooled to \n', 'FORMATION OF BRINE DRAINAGE FEATURES \nCOLD \nALCOHOL , \nSEA-WATER \nFEED-IN- ===~J ,~-------\xad\nPLEXIGLA"S- - - - -(0)\n(c) \n(OVERFLON \nr~H+1=- PLEXIGLAS \nrWN+~--THERMOPANES \n(b) \nFig. I .

Because the \nice growth depends on the thermal properties of the dry air, "Plexiglas", and the ice-water \nmixture, we next discuss how these properties influenced the tank design. \nTable I lists both the thermal conductivities (k) and diffusivities (K) for these four materials. \nThe ks govern the magnitude of the steady heat fluxes; the KS, the propagation speed of a \ntransient temperature disturbance. Since our experiment is a transient one, in that beginning \nat some time t = 0 we cool the freezing cell from above, the magnitude of both the ks and KS \nare important. To estimate the effects of the different materials on the ice growth, we assume \nthat the transient heat-flows in each material arc one-dimensional in the vertical. For onedimensional\nheat flow in the z-direction, Cars law and Jaeger (1959, chapter 2) show that \nTABLE I.

From a calculation of the growth rate of the ice front, however, we can also estimate \nan equivalent K for the growing ice. If the temperature profile in the ice sheet is linear, then \nCarslaw and Jaeger (1959, § 11.2) show that the thickness h of the ice sheet increases according \nto \n_ ( 2kdlTt )i \nh - L \' PI \nwhere !l T is the temperature difference between the cold plate and the sea-water, L is the \nlatent heat, and Pi is the ice density. \nFor the experimental value of !l T ~ 15 0 C, and using L = 335 kJ kg-I and PI ~ 0.92 \nMg m-3, we find that h measured in meters is given by \n(3) \nComparison of Equations ( I) and (3) shows that the equivalent K of the growing sea ice is \n2.2 X 10- 7 m 2 S- I. Therefore the ice front grows at approximately the same rate as the speed \nat which the temperature disturbance propagates in the "Plexiglas". Because of the similar \nproperties of the "Plexiglas" and the growing ice sheet, the temperature field should be \nnearly horizontally uniform across the 0.3 cm thickness of the sheet. \nThe use of dry air (or any common gas) in the thermopane complicates the ice growth \nand is the reason for the use of 1.3 cm thick Plexiglas for the cell walls. Table I shows that air \nhas both the smallest k and largest K of the four materials . The small k of dry air means that \nthe heat flow from the room to the ice is very small compared to almost any other transparent \nmaterial. The large K of dry air, which is two orders of magnitude greater than that of \n"Plexiglas", means that the cold disturbance propagates much faster in air than in "Plexiglas".\nIn trial experiments, we found if the thickness of the "Plexiglas" wall between the \nair and water was only of order I mm, then th e rapid propagation of the cold wave in the \nair relative to the ice and water caused loose crystals to freeze in the water ahead of the ice \nfront. The insulating effect of the 1.3 cm "Plexiglas" cell walls, h owever, prevented this heat \ntransfer from the air to the sea-water so that the ice grew as an advancing planar front. \nThe heat flow from the room to the water through the dry air limited the ice growth. \nWhen the ice reached a thickness of about 20 cm, the heat removed by the cold plate at the \ntop of the cell was of the same order as the heat flow in through the sides over the broad area \nof the thermopane. Therefore, ice of this thickness ceased to grow, and we observed both \ninternal melting inside the ice and some distortion of the interface. \nTo record the growth of the ice sheet, we used both a time-lapse movie camera and a \n35 mm still camera. The photographic lighting consisted of two flood lights placed behind a \ndiffusing screen on one side of the tank, with the cameras on the opposite side. We only \nturned the lights on while we took a photograph; otherwise the tank was left in the dark. \nFor the time-lapse films, the camera turned the ligh ts on and off automatically. Using these \ntechniques, we initially took crossed-polaroid photographs. Figure 2 shows such a photograph\nfor a typical ice sheet in our test cell. The ice resembles natural sea ice in several ways. \nFirst, the ice sheet is made up of the columnar wedge-shaped crystals described by Bennington \n(1963, see especially his figure 14) as typical of sea ice with a horizontal c-axis. Second, \nfrom micro-photographs, we found that the individual dendrites which make up the crystals \nhave a diameter of the order of 1- 5 X 10- 1 mm, which is in the range reported by Lofgren and \n', 'FORMATION OF BRINE DRAINAGE FEATURES \nWeeks (1969)\' Third, the photograph shows the small, black brine pockets and the white \nrandomly-oriented crystals described by LL. The evidence from this and other similar crossedpolaroid\nphotographs is that the ice grown in our cell exhibits many of the features of natural \nsea ice. \nFig. 2. A crossed-polaroid photograph ~r all ice sheet growing in ollr lest cell . The thicklleH of the ice sheetfrolll lop to bottom \nis about 15 Clll. \nOn our crossed-polaroid photographs, however , the brine drainage channels are nearly \ninvisible. To follow the growth and deve lopment of these channels, we used the pH-sensitive \ndye "thymol blue" as a tracer in t\\·.-o different ways. As Baker (1966) describes, when a \n0.01 % by weight solution of thymol blue in sea-water is made basic through the addition of \na few drops of a one molar solution of NaOH , the fluid turns dark blue. Similarly, addition \nof one or more drops of one molar Hel makes the solution acidic and the fluid col or changes \nto light ye llow. If a weak current flows between two electrodes placed in the acidic solution, \na proton transfer takes place at the positive electrode with the result that the solution turns \nbasic and therefore blue. \nThel-efore, inside our tank, we placed horizontal wires across our cell at 2 cm depth \nintervals , using platinum wire with a diameter of 10- 1 mm as the positive electrode and \nequally thin copper wire as the negative. When current flowed between the wires, thin blue \ncylinde rs formed around the platinum wires. As Baker shows, since this dye technique, which \ninvolves on ly an electron transfer, does not change the local fluid density, the cylinders of dye \nfollow the water motion until the color re turns to yellow. An additional advantage of this \ntechnique is that the water beneath the ice could be quickly cleared of dye through the \naddition of a small amount of acid. Inside the ice, this technique worked well for the first \nday or two, but over the two-to-five day course of an experiment, gas bubbles formed on the \n', 'JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY \nwires and damaged the ice. Therefore, we supplemented this technique with the injection \nof a thymol blue solution into the bottom of the cell. The subsequent entrainment of the dyed \nwater by the growing ice sheet also marked the drainage features . \nOBSERVATIONS OF THE BRINE DRAINAGE FEATURES \nThe dye techniques yielded excellent pictures of the brine channels. As an example, \nFigure 3 is a sequence of three photographs in which we both injected dye under the ice and \ngenerated dye at the wires inside the ice. The figure shows that two different but related \nphenomena take place. First, there is a dye advance on a nearly uniform front up into the \nice above the height of the interface at the time of dye injection. Second, there are concentrations\nof dye in "brine drainage channels" from which, especially in Figure 3b, entrained \ndye pours out of the ice. \nWe will first discuss the uniform entrainment of dye. Although they are not visible on the \nreproductions, a close examination of the original photographs of Figure 3 shows that the \nuniform upward flow of dye is a ccompanied by many small streamers leaving the ice simi lar \nto those observed by Foster ( 1969) and Farhadieh and Tankin ( 1972). Further, in a laboratory\nexperiment on the absorption of oil by sea ice, Wolfe and Hoult (1974) observed that \noil injected under growing sea ice was uniformly entrained. Therefore, our observations of this \nentrainment are consistent with other laboratory investigators. \nAlso, in their field observations of sea ice, LL observed that the ice near the ice- water \ninterface consists of a porous dendritic crystal layer. They show photographs of closely-packed \nvertically-oriented tubes in this crystal layer, which they describe as right circular cylinders \nwith constant radii of the order of 10- 1 mm . In addition to these visual observations, LL embedded\nthermistors in the lower part of the ice by allowing the sea ice to grow down over a \nthermistor array. From these thermistors, they observed regular variations in the temperature \nwhich they attributed to convection in the intergranular tubes near the ice-water interface. \nAs the ice grew down past the thermistors, the fluctuations became smaller, then disappeared. \nPresumably, the upward flow of dye which we observe is visual evidence of the same convection.\nFor two cases, we measured the average height as a function of time of the upward entrain-\nment of dye above the interface depth at the time of the dye injection. Figure 4 compares \nthese measured points with a curve of the form \nz=a(l-e- bt ). (4) \nThe open circles show the entrainment in the ice of Figure 3; the open triangles, entrainment \nin ice of an initial thickness 20 cm, a case which may be affected by side-wall effects. For both \ncases, b = 7 X 10- 5 S- I, while for the first case, a = 1.8 cm, and the second, a = 5· 75 cm. \nAt present, we have no theoretical model of this entrainment; however, it is presumably \nrelated to convection in the intergranular tubes. \nThe second obvious feature of Figure 3 is the presence and growth of the brine drainage \nchannels. When we closely examined these channels within the cell, we found that they did \nnot form preferentially against the "Plexiglas" walls, rather both the feeder and central \nchannels meandered within the ice sheet. Many other investigators report the existence of \nbrine channels; the best documentation is again that of LL. By cutting a large piece of \nnatural sea ice into many horizontal sections, they obtained a three-dimensional picture of \nthe brine drainage systems. They observed vertical channels with diameters of order of \nI cm extending at least 60 cm up into 1.6 m thick sea ice with a horizontal spacing of 10-20 \ncm. Each vertical channel had many slanted feeder tubes running into it, so that each system \ndrained a cylindrical region with a diameter of the order of 10 cm. As Figure 3 shows, the \ndrainage channels which form in our ice sheet resemble on a much smaller scale those described\nby LL. \n', 'FORMATION OF BRINE DRAINAGE FEATURES 143 \na \nb \nc \nFig. 3.

See text for additional \ndiscussiDn. \nFigure 5 shows a close-up view of a brine drainage system similar to those in Figure 3. \nThe montage (5a) clearly shows the brine channel, some of its feeder tubes, and the brine \npouring out of the tip. The additional photograph of the tip (5b) was taken roughly IQ min \nafter (5a). During this time, as the small arrow which marks the same pair of brine pockets \nin both photographs shows, the brine channel moved about 0.5 cm to the right. Comparison \nof (5a) and (5b) shows that as the brine channel moved, it left a mass of randomly oriented \nice crystals in its wake. The figure also shows what may be the original exit of the brine \nchannel at about 0.25 cm to the left of the exit in Figure 5a. Finally, an extremely interesting \nfeature of the brine drainage channel is that the channel diameter just above the ice- water \ninterface is about t the diameter higher up in the ice. This brine channel "neck", which is a \ncommon feature of our laboratory ice, may also occur in natural sea ice. Careful examination \nof Figure 2 of LL, a photograph of a brine channel cross-section at the ice- water interface, \nsuggests that just above the interface the channel diameter decreases from about I cm to \n2-3 mm. \nOur time-lapse films, even though the individual frames are of insufficient quality for \njournal reproduction, provide additional information about the formation and evolution of \nthese brine channels. First, on these films the feeder channels appear suddenly from the \napparent fracture of both air and brine pockets into a central channel. Second, as in Figure 5, \nthe channel tips sway and move across the crystals with time. Third, in a large number of \ncases oscillations consisting of a brine flow out of the.ice, followed by a sea-water flow up into \nthe ice, occur in the brine channels. For example, in 10 cm thick ice, we observed in one \ninstance a total of 8-10 individual brine drainage systems over a horizontal distance of about \n20 cm. Oscillations occurred in each of these channels, with the duration of the downward \nflow being generally much longer than that of the upward flow. The most regular of these \noscillators, which we followed for 8 h, had a period of roughly I h, with an 8-15 min inflow \nand an approximately 45 min outflow. \nIn the following sections, we first present a qualitative model for the formation of brine \ndrainage systems, then give a physical explanation for the brine-channel neck, and finally \nshow that the neck may be the cause of the observed oscillations. \n', 'FORMATION OF BR IN E DRAINA GE FEATURES 145 \nlcm \na b \nFig. 5.

The lack of clarity \nof the li,o in (5b ) is cal/sed by crystals being between the camem and the channel. \n', 'JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY \nTHE FORMATION OF BRINE DRAINAGE CHANNELS IN YOUNG SEA ICE \nWe base our qualitative, physical model for the formation of brine channels in young, \ngrowing sea ice on the studies of Rand S, who describe the formation of drainage tubes in \ntemperate glaciers from the movement of water through the porous ice. In our model, we \nassume that the sea ice is sufficiently warmer than -23 0 C so that it also is porous. The best \nevidence for the porosity of sea ice are the previously cited observations of the absence of salt \nabove the water-line. This suggests that the difference between the hydrostatic head of seawater\nand that of the interior brine creates the pressure gradient force which drives the brine \nout of the ice. As Rand S show for temperate glaciers, the difference between the pressure \nhead of the ice and that of the fresh water generates an analogous driving force. \nTo calculate the force driving the brine out of the ice, we consider a growing ice sheet \nwhich is permeated with brine channels, floating in sea-water. From Figure 6, a schematic \nview of the ice sheet, the sea-water hydrostatic pressure at a height Z below the water-line \ninside the ice is \n(5) \nwhere Po = 1.025 Mg m-3 is the sea-water density, g = 9.8 m S - 2 IS the acceleration of \ngravity, and HI (t ) is the depth to which the ice sheet is submerged. \nAir \nFig. 6. The co-ordinate system used in the discussion of brine channel formation. HI (t ) is the depth to which the ice sheet floats, \nand H2(t ) is the height of brine in a brine drainage channel. \nTo calculate the pressure in a brine channel, we note that in a growing ice sheet, the \ntemperature generally decreases upward from the bottom of the ice. For the brine inside the \nice to be in equilibrium with the ice at each level , the salinity s and thereby the brine density \nPb must also increase with height. Therefore, the brine hydrostatic pressure Pb inside of a \nchannel is \nH ,(t) \nPb(Z) = g J Pb (T (z)) dz, (6) \nwhere Hz(t), the level of the brine in the channel system, may be greater than H1 (t). \nIn our experiment, the ice begins its growth as a matrix of vertical dendrites and intergranular\ntubes. In the field, sea ice begins as a thin layer of horizontal crystals, after which the \ngrowth resembles our laboratory ice. Therefore, to model the formation of a brine drainage \nsystem, we consider the steady Poisseuille flow of brine in a tube of uniform radius r extending \nvertically up into the ice. From simple hydraulics theory (see Rothlisberger (1972) or Martin \n(1970) for the derivation and additional references) with the addition of the Boussinesq \napproximation, which neglects variations in density except when they occur in product \nwith g, the volume flux q out of the tube is \n', "FORMATION OF BRINE DRAINAGE FEATURES 147 \nwhere \n<l> (t) = Pb (O) - P(O) \nand Pb and Vb are respectively the mean density and viscosity of the brine.

Further, for a particular density gradient, the solution \nof <l>(t) = 0 gives the minimum value of H z in terms of HI ' \nGiven Equation (7), we next show for a linear temperature gradient inside the ice, that, \nas the ice thickness increases, brine flows out of the ice. For a linear profile, we write the \ntemperature difference across the ice sheet as \n(} To-Tm = Z, \nHI (t) PO/PI \n(8) \nwhere To is the sea-water temperature, T m the assumed constant temperature of the upper \nsurface, and the denominator is the total ice thickness. \nOn the additional assumption that the density of the brine inside the ice is a linear function \nof fJ, we write \n(9) \nSince Pb varies from 1.0 Mg m- 3 at 0 0 C to 1.2 Mg m - 3 at - 200 C, the value of the parameter \nis y :::::: 10- 2 deg- I • \nGiven Equations (9) and (7), we can solve for the minimum level of H2 as a function of \nHI as the ice thickness increases.

Thereiore, as the ice grows thicker, the pressure-gradient force drives \nthe cold brine in the small intergranular tubes down into warmer ice. \nThe downward movement of cold brine generates a heat flux to the tube. The flux has \ntwo components; first, the heat flux Ft generated by the temperature difference between the \nbrine and its surroundings; second, the heat flux f~ generated by the side-wall melting which \noccurs to keep the brine on the eutectic curve. In the Appendix, we show that the ratio ex of \nthese two fluxes for the idealized case of a small volume of fluid of salinity s subjected to a small \ntemperature change ~ T is \n7.4 X 102 \ns \nFor s = 200%0, ex = 4; for s = 35%0' ex = 21. From Equation ( 12), the melting generated \nby the eutectic boundary condition creates a much larger heat flux than that caused by the \nwarming of the cold brine. \nThe combination of the side-wall melting and the large heat flux to the tube has two \neffects. First, the large heat flux cools the adjacent ice and thus creates a cold region around \nthe tube. Through the eutectic condition, this cooling increases the brine density in Equation \n(6), so that the pressure-gradient force driving the brine out of the ice also increases. Second, \nthe side· wall melting increases the tube radius r in Equation (7a).- Since q ex: r4, a small \n", 'JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY \nincrease in radius yields a much faster flow of brine out of the tube, which thereby decreases \nthe brine pressure head. Therefore, the combined effects of the side-wall melting generate a \ncold, low-pressure region around a brine tube. This forces the brine in the surrounding ice \nto flow to the region of lower pressure at the tube, or alternatively to fracture through to the \ntube and thereby generate the feeder channels. In particular, the cooling of the surrounding \nice may cause the fracture of the nearby brine pockets from the freezing-generated pressure \nbuild-up; this process may yield the sudden formation of feeder channels which we observe \nin our time-lapse films. \nObviously if all of the intergranular tubes are of the same initial diameter, the above \nprocess will not generate the brine drainage systems, since the diameter of each intergranular \ntube will grow at the same rate . In reality, small variations in both tube diameter and \npressure head cause some tubes to grow faster than others, thereby yielding the observed \ndrainage systems. Thus salinity plays a similar role in enlarging the size of drainage channels \nto that turbulent heating plays in the glacier models of Rand S. \nTHE "NECK" PHENOMENON IN BRINE DRAINAGE CHANNELS \nBecause the sea-water under growing sea ice is at its freezing point, there is one major \ndifference between sea-ice and glacier drainage. To illustrate, Figure 7 compares schematic \ndrawings of the drainage systems for temperate glaciers and sea ice. The glacier drainage \nfollows the descriptions of Rand S; the sea-ice drainage is based both on our Figures 3 and 5 \nand the field observations of LL. The glacier drainage system is "arboreal" or river-like, \nwith the channel radii increasing toward the exit. The sea-ice drainage system is nonarboreal,\nin that the channel has a neck just above the ice-water interface. This neck, which \nwe next show to be a real physical phenomenon, may be the cause of the oscillations observed \nin our films. \nFor most of our observed brine drainage systems, the radius of the bottom few millimeters \nof a channel is much less than the channel radius inside the ice. Martin (1974, abbreviated \nMS) shows that a similar neck occurs at the tip of a growing ice stalactite, in that the inner \nradius of the stalactite tip through which brine exits to the sea-water is much smaller than \na b \nFig. 7. A comparison of the drainage systemsfor (a) temperate glaciers and (b) young sea ice. See textfor additional discussion. \n', 'FORMATION OF BRINE DRAINAGE FEATURES 149 \nthe stalactite inner radius away from the tip. From both a scale analysis and direct observation,\nMS shows that the onset of a convective instability maintains the small tip size. In the \nfollowing, we argue that the same instability controls the exit radius of a brine channel. \nTwo factors determine the small size of both the stalactite tips and the brine-channel \nnecks. In each case, the sea-water under growing ice is both at its salinity-determined freezing \npoint and lighter than the brine which flows from the ice. The effect of the density difference \n!!.p between the sea-water and the brine is to create a buoyancy force tlpg acting upward. \nInside either the stalactite or channel, a pressure gradient force Fp which drives the brine \nout of the ice opposes this buoyancy force . \nTo calculate Fp, we assume for simplicity that both the magnitude of the volume flux q \nin the neck is imposed on the neck by the properties of the upper part of the drainage channel \nand the flow in the neck is Poisseuille flow, in which case \nF \n_ 8pbvbQ \np- , \n7Ta4 \nwhere a is the radius of the neck. From Equation (13), for a sufficiently small neck radius, \nFp > tlpg, and the brine flows out of the neck in a uniform stream; for a larger neck radius, \nFp < tlpg, so that the buoyant sea-water intrudes into the neck. Then, because the sea-water \nis at its freezing point and the ice is colder than the water, some of the sea-water freezes to the \nside of the neck. The intrusion and freezing continue until the radius a is reduced to the \npoint where the forces balance. \nBecause the salinity-driven ablation always acts to increase the neck radius, while the \nintrusion and freezing of sea-water decreases the radius, the value of a should be determined \nby the force balance Fp = !!.pg. MS calls the ratio of these two forces an " entrainment" \nnumber E, where \nWhen E < I, the flow from the neck is unidirectional; when E > I, overturning occurs. \nFor stalactite tips, MS shows that the tip radius is very n early predicted by E = I. \nGiven the above argument, Figure 8 shows how the neck adjusts to a change in flow rate. \nIn Figure 8a, the brine flows uniformly out of the tip. In Figure 8b, we abruptly decrease \nthe flow so that E > I. Therefore as Figure 8c shows, sea-water intrudes into the neck, \nfreezes to the wall, and reduces the radius back to a sub-critical value. Because of the difficulties\nof measuring volume flow rates from brine channels, we have not quantitatively \ncompared the observed values of a with the values computed from E = I; however, we have \nqualitatively observed in our experiments that a decreases smoothly as q decreases. \na b c \nFig. 8. The sequence of sketches (a--c) shows how the tip of a brine channel adjusts to a decrease in flow rate. In the sketches, \nthe dark brine flows out of the ice into sea-water. \n', 'JOURNAL OF GLAC1OLOGY \nFor very slow flows, or in the limit of q -+ 0, salt diffusion becomes important so that the \nabove criterion is no longer valid . For q = 0, LL argue that a Rayleigh-number criterion \ndetermines the minimum size of a channel. Using this criterion (see LL for references), they \nshow that the minimum tube size is determined from \nga4 op \n-D ~~68, \np v u Z \nwhere op/oz is the density gradient inside the tube imposed by the temperature field in the \nice, and D is the salt diffusivity. \nFor our experiment, the temperature gradient is of order 102 deg m-I, so that \n( I /p) (op/oz) ~ I m-I and D ~ 10- 9 m 2 S - I. Substitution of both these values and the other \nparameters into Equation ( IS) gives a minimum channel size of a = 3 X 10-1 mm, which is \nof the observed order. Therefore in the limit of q --+ 0, the channel remains open. \nOSCILLATIONS IN THE BRINE CHANNELS \nA theoretical consequence of both the presence of the neck and the gravity drainage from \nthe channel is that oscillations similar to those observed in our time-lapse films can occur in \nthe brine channels. Martin (1970, hereafter abbreviated as MSO) observed and theoretically \ndescribed similar oscillations in a hypodermic syringe. In the following, we will first discuss \nthe similarities between a brine channel and a syringe, then physically describe why the \noscillations occur. \nA syringe which is filled with brine and partially submerged in a beaker of fresh water \nis a crude approximation to a brine channel. The thin needle of the syringe is analogous to \nthe neck of the channel, while the broad barrel crudely models the brine-channel-feeder-tube \nsystem above the neck. The open top of the syringe, which could be replaced by a porous \nplug without affecting the oscillations, models the ice porosity. As Figure 9 shows, the oscillations\nin a syringe occur as a downward jet of brine, followed by an upward jet of water, and \nso on for many cycles. It is very easy to produce these oscillations in the laboratory. In his \nexperiments, MSO measured periods varying from 4 s to several minutes, depending on the \nparticular choice of needle and syringe. The length of the needle can be very short without \neliminating the oscillations; in one case MSO (p. 143) observed that "a tin can of radius \n3.3 cm with a pin hole in the bottom, which was initially filled to a depth of 8 cm with a \nsaturated solution of sodium chloride produced oscillations with a period of 40 s and ran \n101\' four days". \nFREE SURFACE \nSYRINGE --_ " / \n~\'-4/"""\'U \nFRESH WATER \n(a) (b) \nFig. 9. The oscillations in a brine-jilled syringe. (a) Downward flow. (b) Upward flow. (Adapted from Martin (1970), \nfigure I) . \n', 'FORMATION OF BRINE DRAINAGE FEATURES \nThe reason the oscillations occur is that the brine level inside the syringe oscillates between \ntwo positions of hydrostatic equilibrium. As Figure 10 shows, the equilibrium brine level \ninside the syringe is lower when brine fills the needle than when fresh water fills the needle. \nSuppose the system is initially at position (a) in Figure 10 with the needle filled with brine. \nThen, any diffusive or convective exchange process in the bottom of the needle which replaces \nthe brine with fresh water disturbs the hydrostatic balance, since the fresh water interface \nmoves up the needle while the brine level inside the syringe is unchanged. \nFor the fluid to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium, the brine interface in the syringe must \nrise by a height proportional to that of the fresh water intrusion in the needle. Because the \ncross-sectional area of the syringe is much greater than that of the needle, restoration of \nequilibrium requires the flow of a relatively large volume of water into the syringe. Therefore, \na small mass perturbation in the needle creates a large pressure imbalance in the syringe \nwhich then amplifies the perturbation and accelerates fresh water up the needle until a jet \nerupts into the syringe. The upward flow continues until the interface level in the syringe \nreaches the second hydrostatic position in Figure lOb with fresh water filling the needle. At \nthis point, the process is reversed, in that any movement of brine into the needle again \ncreates a pressure imbalance which now accelerates brine down the needle, thus generating a \ndownward jet. In this way, the oscillations continue until the fluid in the syringe is diluted \nalmost to the fresh-water density. \n(a) (b) \nFig. ID. The positions of hydrostatic balance in the syringe. (a ) Needle filled with salt water. (b ) N eedle filled with fresh \nwaler (adaptedfram Martin (1970 ), figure 3 ). \nThere are several differences between the syringe and the brine channels. First, an ice \nneck replaces the needle, where the entrainment number criterion controls the radius of the \nneck for the downward flow. This variation of the needle radius with volume flux changes \nthe theory described in MSO, but does not alter the physics. Second, the ice is growing, \nwhich is equivalent to slowly submerging the syringe without changing the mean brine level. \nThis means that the upward and downward jets will not have equal periods, rather the flow \nwill be primarily downward with brief periods of upward flow. This inequality of the upward \nand downward periods is what we observe in our time-lapse films . Third, the syringe model \ncompletely neglects any temperature effects such as the freezing of sea-water inside the ice \nwith the subsequent change in volume. In spite of this neglect, the effects of the geometry of \nthe brine channel should be more important than the interior freezing and melting in governing\nthe onset of the oscillations. In conclusion, the syringe analogy strongly suggests that the \nbrine channel geometry causes the observed oscillations. \n', '\'52 JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY \nCONCLUDING REMARKS \nIf the oscillations observed in our laboratory ice also occur in the pack ice, they would \nserve as efficient rapidly-acting pumps for the removal of brine from ice and its replacement \nwith sea-water. Besides providing an efficient desalination mechanism, the oscillations may \nhave three additional effects. First, they would provide both oxygen and nutrients to organisms \nliving inside the ice. Second, the oscillations would contribute to the liquid content of the \nlower part of the ice, a factor which is important in the absorption and reflection of underwater \nsound. Third, the oscillations would entrain pollutants, such as petroleum or pesticides, \ninside the growing ice. For example, this entrainment could absorb and store part of a winter \noil spill for later release during the summer melting. Both the oscillatory pumping and the \noverall entrainment process described in the second section and observed by Wolfe and \nHoult (\'974) for oil released under ice could be important in planning for the control of oil \nspills in ice-covered seas. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors thank both Donald Immerwahr and Peter Kauffman for their helpful \nsuggestions and assistance with the experiment; and specifically Peter Kauffman for photographing\nthe brine channel shown in Figure 5 and printing all of the photographs shown \nherein.

This heat flow has two components. First, the temperature difference between the brine and \nthe surrounding ice generates a "thermal" flow Qt; second, the melting of the ice generated by the eutectic \nboundary condition generates a "saline" flow Qs. \nTo model the kinematics of this phenomenon, W ~ consider a volume element of salt water at a temperature \nTo, salinity so, and with a density Po and volume Vo which is in equilibrium with a much larger volume of ice \nat To. We then increase the ice temperature to To + ~ T. To calculate the total heat flow to the brine element, we \nassume the element first warms to the temperature To + ~ T, then the walls melt to keep the brine on the eutectic \ncurve. Ono (1967) and other investigators made calculations similar to the following in the derivations of the \nlatent and specific heats of sea ice. In the present calculations, however, we wish to examine the dynamic consequences\nof this heat flow. \nGiven a temperature change ~ T, the heat flow to the volume element is \nQt = Pocp~TVo, (16a) \nwhere Cp is the specific heat capacity. To dilute the brine so that it remains on the eutectic curve, the volume \nincreases by an am:>unt ~ V, thus generating the additional heat flow \nQs = LPI~V, (16b) \nwhere L is the latent heat and PI is the ice density. \nTo compare the magnitude of Q. with Qt, we write ~ V in Equation (16b) in terms of To and t1 T from the \nconservation of salt. For the brine element, the conservation of salt may be written as \na \naT(sPV) = o. \nDifferentiation of Equation (17) along the eutectic curve gives \nsp :;!E + pV :~ ! E + Vs aa;IE = 0, \nwhere the subscript E refers to the eutectic curve. \nFor sodium chloride solutions, or sea-water above - 23° C, \n- aa~IE = fill::::: lo%.deg- I , \nand \nwhere rn, and rn, are approximately constant. \nFrom Equation (19), we rewrite Equation (18) as \n,I aV! _ fII\' +fII, \nVaT E- 7 p. (20) \n', "154 JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY \nIn sea ice, the salinity S varies from approximately 3Q-230%. and the brine density P ~ 1 Mg m - J , so that \nm, ~ 3 X 10- ' - 3 X 10-' > ~ ~ 10- '. \nS P \nTherefore, as a fair approximation, Equation (20) in difference form becomes \nAV ATm, \nv.~~ \nwhere we assume A V and A T vary along the eutectic curve. \nSubstitution of Equation (21) into Equation (16b) gives \nQ \n_ LpIVoATm, \n8 - , \nSo \nso that the ratio of the two heat flows become \nSince the heat flux is defined as the heat flow per unit time, « is also the ratio of the respective heat fluxes. \nFor sodium chloride solutions, L = 335 kJ kg- I, PI = 0.92 Mg m - J, p ~ 1.1 Mg m-J, and &p = 3.8 kJ kg- I \ndeg- ' (from Kaufman, 1960). Substitution of these values into Equation (23) gives \n740 «=-. \nSo \nTherefore, « varies from 4 at S = 200%. to 21 at S = 35roo' so that the movement and subsequent dilution of \nbrine within the ice may yield a large flux of heat to the brine channel. \n"]</pre>
