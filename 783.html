The silent\nman in the majority of cases, knows a\nthing or two. He has excellent hear\ning, and his grey matter no doubt as\nsimlates a great deal more knowledge\nthan the head of his volnhle neighbor.\nThe qniet man with the keen eye and\nthequickear is tobeenvied. More wick\ned things are done by the person with\nthe wagging tongne, than the man\nwith the quick ear. Have you ever seen\nthe talking man trying to have a con\nversation with the quiet man! Isn\'t it\ninteresting7 All the while you are lik\ning the q> iet man more and more, aud\nthe garrulous chap grows more and\nmore foolish in your eyes every minute,\nuntil bye and bye you wish some one\nwould call the police.\nKNOCKERS\nIn the days of old one most essential\nrequisite for every door was the quaint\nold-fashioned knocker, now out of date,\nand found only in the antiquarian\'s\nshop. From this obsolete bit of iron or\nbrass the name has passed to some men\nof today labelled "knockers." Tlie aro\nmatic vice of tobacco has not blunted\nhis keenness of scent, nor has the roar\nof civilization deafened his ears. The\nmultiplicty of printed books and papers\nhas not dimmed his eyes. Alas that\nhis senses and faculties should be used\n. to criticise, complain and knock. He is\nnot far removed from his primitive an\ncestry at the Beginning of Things with\nhis love for overcoming. From the\npi inciple of economy when you meet a\nknocker don\'t listen to him. Hit him\nwhere his brains ought to be, and kick\nwhere they are.\nDANNY DANDELION\nThe Dandelion now observe, the\n"freshest" plant of all, has the most\nexalted nerve, and the most colossal\ngall. "Get all you can," so runs his\ncreed, "and give a blamed sight less:"\nthese are the simple rules that lead to\nglittering success. When other flowers\nhave closed their eyes the Dandelion\nlabors, and everlastingly Danny tries to\novercome his neighbors. The blue gross\nand the clover flee before his competi\ntion; he has no social sympathy to\ncheck his fierce competition. Although\nhis harm is some times great; his\nworthlessness sublime, he gets a lot of\nreal estate by rooting all tho time. So\nnerve, and front, and diligence will\nsurely tak6 us far. It makes no special\ndifference how no account we are.\nNOT FOR SALE\nYou cannot buy the puro air of\nheaven as it comes from a thousand\nsun-kissed hills; the splash of the little\nblue wave that has journeyed all across\nthe sparkling lake, as it gives its Joyful\ncares to the old groy rock at your feet;\nthe carol of the early song-bird; or the\ntrue l>eauty of fern and flower, moun\ntain and meadow.\nFACTS\nAll this balderdush about the "f4ood\nold times" Is buncombe. Peoplo were\nbarbarous and civilization was in its\nswaddles. We were hanging witches\nin New England; it was a crime to\nlaugh on Huudny; greasy Indians wero\nheroes and woman was a slave. Think\nit over.\nASTRONOMY\nOur earth lies betwoen the planets\nVenus and Mars, the worlds of love\nand war. It is typical of the condi\ntions In which our lives are cast. Wo\nmust love and we must fight, and wo\nMust fight earnestly as we love inten\nsely and tenderly.\n"A FOOL THERE WAS"\nMonarch of nil he surveyed was the\nancient Adam ages ago till Eve came.\nShe was weaker but conquered him\nwith the weapons of weakness?finesse,\ntact; persisteut persuasion. See her\nsitting beside him; he is holding the\nreins in his strong hands. Gently she\ntook the reins out of his hands and\nsmilingly permitted tim to hold the\nends, and ever since he has been think\ning that he w<is driving. He still\nthinks so.\nAs the desks have been taken out of\nCongress, it looks as if the members would\nbe compelled to put their feet on the floor.\nThe European powers feel that it is\nimpossible to grant the Balkan allies\'\ndemands, since they went to war for\nhumanitarian reasons.\nIf Mr. Wilson keeps on wearing that grey\nsack suit, will the tourists bother to shake\nhands with him?\nIt is said that William Dean Howells once\nwrote a poem on spring, but as it happened\nin his early youth, it is perhaps too late to\nfine him for it now.\nThe younger farmers seem to be getti ng\naway from the old idea that the best\ncollege of agriculture is the town\ncurbstone.\nDemon of the Niger.\nThe natives inhabiting the country\nnear the source of the Niger believe\nthat a devil lives In the rock whenoe\nthe river springs. They are very super\nstitious and greatly fear this devil,\nwho Is supposed to kill any person\nwho dares to look at the source.\nWhenever the natives are showing a\nstranger the spot, they cover up their\nfaoes and walk backward in the dlreo\ntlon of the Bpring, pointing toward it\nwith outstretched hand behind the\nback.\nSeaweed in Commerce.\nIt Is always known that seaweed\ncontained a large quantity of Iodine,\nbut today It is used in the manufac\nture of a certain kind of cloth, while\noertaln species are eaten under the\nnames of "dulse," "stoke" and "cur\nrage in." Kelp is burned seaweed,\nand Devonshire seaweed Is used for\na large number of purposes; there\nfore, the seaweed gatherers of today\nare In a better position than ever\nbefore.\nLucrative Find in 8outh Afrlci.\nSouth Africa\'s possibilities as a pro\nducer of vegetable oils are wide In\ndeed if the results of recent experi\nments under the auspices of the Mo\nzambique authorities are translated\ninto commercial rfealltles. Por In\nstance, the fruit of the "niacua\nmacua" was shown to yield no less\nthan 00 per cent of fine edible oil, and\nof the "pombula" 62 per cent.\n8omewhat Ambiguous.\nThe banquet hall was adorned with\nmany beautiful paintings, and the\npresident of the little college was call\ned upon to respond to a toast. Wish\ning to pay a compliment to the ladies\npresent he designated the paintings\nwith an eloquent gesture and said:\n"What need Is there of these painted\nbeauties when we have so many with\nus at the table?"\nSatisfactorily Settled.\nA very satisfactory method of set\ntling a love dispute occurred In Buda\npest (Hungary) the other day.

So why In fancy she should\nalways be furnishing that spare cham\nber, laying the gray rug on Its floor,\nhanging the dimity curtains and\nsmoothing the Marseilles spread, she\nherself could not explain.\nShe even arranged the books In the\nlittle white caBe, books calculated to\nput a guest in good humor with him- i\nself, books which would bring about\nthat peaceful state of mind conducive\nto sleep. She would have no exciting\nnovels, no passionate poems, no soci\nological firebrands in her guest\nchamber. There should be such vol\numes as "The Measure of the Hours,"\n"Society and Solitude," "Sesame and\nLilies." These would become the\nshelves and gratify a guest even If he\nnever got beyond the titles.\nSo when by a generous Increase in\nher salary the apartment was made |\npossible she took one with five rooms\ninstead of four, because, as she told\nthe agent, she "must have a spare\nroom."\nThe roomB of reality are -never as\nwell furnished as are those in the\nhouses of our imagination. Still, her\nguest chamber was a marvel of white\nness and daintiness. There was a\nlovely gray hand woven flower bord- j\nered rug on the floor and a French\nstriped paper with a pattern of tiny j\nrosebuds on the wall. The woodwork\nwas white, and so were the little Iron\nbed and the enameled dresser and the j\nstiff chair. There was another chair, j\na rocker, covered with cretonne of\nmuch tbe same pattern as the paper,\nand it stood close to a low wicker ta\nble, on which was placed a small rain\nbow glass vase, an Indian basket and I\na few books.\nThe covers of the books were of\nthe same colors as those in the wall\npaper?pink, to match the buds, or \'\ngreen, to match the buds\' leaves?and\nthey looked like the kind of books one\nis proud to buy, but never has time\nto read. But "The Measure of the\nHours," "Society and Solitude" and\n"Sesame and Lilies" stood up freBh\nand inviting.\nIt was a conventional room, but It\nhad coBt much thought and self-denial\nto procure it. And it was ten times\nmore costly than her own.\nBut where was the guest? After\nthree months of residence in her new\nhome she had never turned down the\nMarseilles spread nor put flowers in\nthe rainbow glass vase, nor brought\nout the gueBt towel that she herself\nhad embroidered.

Then again It was\nan old friend of her father\'s, an aris\ntocratic woman, who had visited them\nin the days of their prosperity, and\nwho. belna literary in her taataa\nwould be sure to appreciate the qual\nity of the quilt and to pounce upon\nthe "Sesame and LllleB."\nOne day, a minute after she had\nclosed the door on the grocer\'s shabby\nboy, who had consented to deliver her\ngroceries after she had returned home\nat night, she heard a crash on the\nback porch and the sound of some one\nfalling.

After he had\ngone she used to love to sit alone In\nthe little rocker, staring meditatively\nat the backs of the books and at the\nroses on the wall.\nHut this Is not all of the story.

He looked so shabby\nand sort of homeless that I gave him\nyour other light overcoat.*\n| " \'That ought to be a good start to\n\' ward getting him a home,\' I said In\nmirth provoking way.

There\nupon Guy told Sally she had forgotten\nher position, and added: "If you take\nupon yourself to order matters con\ntrary to my Instructions before we are\nmarried, what will you not do after?\nI renounce my matrimonial intentions\ntoward you."
