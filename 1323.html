LI.SS\n(iHRMAN\nThe Presbyterian Fv angeilsl, on\nlast Sunday evening. In his last ser?\nmon here, made public mention of\nthe German which the young people\ngave in the Town Hall last Monday\nnights week. In the midst of Ihe j\nrevival sei \\ ices. He deplored the\nfact that BUCh a diversion should\nhave been engaged in by Ihe people\nof the town who. If not membera of\nthe chinches were connected with\nthem In B family relation, and even\nif not connected with any church the\ntime was inopportune for a dance.\nThis paper has one or two thtnga to\naay : We don\'t think the dance\nmould have been given at the time.\nH did look a little out of place, t\'an\ndOff compels thisa.lmissioii.and partie\nularly so when it is remembered that\nmembsra Of churches were engaged\nin it. Would it not llave looked hit?\nler, and contributed more to the good\nof society to have postponed the t\'er\n?nan. and for these intlueiitial young\npeople to have thrown the weight of\nl heir presence and Influence\nto the success of the meeting\nratiu-r ihan against ii.\' Certainly\nfor the good of others\nthis swems to have been the course\nwhich unselfish wisdom and pru?\ndence would have dictated. However,\nWO do nut believe that any direct\naffront was intended by the young\npeople, They just didn\'t think. If\nsome older person had suggested a\npostponement no doubt It vvouldhave\nbeen acquiesced in readily. We make\nthis assertion and apology, if apology\nis oeeded, entirely gratuitously, snd\nwithout consultation, from w hat WO\nknow of the members Ol this club,\nand the people who attended. They\nare all interested in whatever tends\nto build up the town, ami we feel\nsure we must lie correct when we\nsay that it WSS S thoughtless (*er\nman, 80 far as the meeting was con?\ncerned. No one in the club or con?\nnected with the dance would utter a\nword or do an act, if they knew it,\nwhich would retard the cause of re?\nligion, or wound the feelings of their\npastor in any manner. They just\nditl\'t think.\nNow, however, let the mailer bfl\nbrought home to the churches ami\njiaslors. \' Every one of the\nchurches have positive laws on their\nbooks prohibiting dancing, hut said\nlaws are "dead letters"?never en?\nforced, but ignored and set at naught,\nanil when the young jKOple dance the\nchurch authorities ought not to com?\nplain and atop, but exercise their\nauthority to prevent it.
