Many were killed, and It is\nrecorded of one French ambulance\ncrew that they worked for six days\nand nights without rest, only finally\nto be killed.\nThe Germans, as you know, at\ntacking behind a barrage, got through\non both sides of Kemmel, and fight\ning of the fiercest description ent\non between Dranoutre and Locre.\nThe French, after the enemy once\ngot round them into Dranoutre, re\nformed In a wood JUBt behind and\nnorthwest of the village, re-attacked,\ndrove the Germans out of the village,\nand held It through the day.

Ever since the tenth cen\ntury, when the Polish king, Boleslaa,\nknown as the Brave, was forced to de\nfeud bis territories from the brigand\nBurusi, or Prussians, lying to the\nnorth, that sinister power plotted the\nundoing of the Polish people. That\nruin has been completed, as far as na\ntional life Is concerned. There Is no\nPoland today. Poland existed, at the\nstart of . this world war, only as a\nvague district In eastern Europe,\nruled, or rather misruled, by Prussia,\nAustria and the Russia of the czar.\nIf wns In the earlv nart ot the sev\nenteenth century that Prussia united\nwith the electorate of Brandenburg.\nAll Prussian alliances have been for\noffensive purposes, and this early al\nllsnra with the Hohenzollern family\nmarked the first determined effort by\nPrussia to subjugate Poland, for it was\niimivr Hi Hohenzollern klnes of Prus\nsia that Saxony, Bavaria.

Wilhelm II. direct lineal de\nscendant of Frederick the Great, Is to\nday no more kindly disposed toward\nthe Poles than was his crafty and un\nscrupulous ancestor, who arranged ana\n(Vimnleted the final dismemberment of\nPoland ; and Wilhelm II has no more\nintention of eiviiiir the Poles their po\nlitical and economic freedom than had\nFrederick the Great when he robbed\nthem of their priceless heritage.\nThe United States today is engaged\nin a war seainst this line of disturbers\nof the peace of Europe, these Hohen-\naollern plotters against tne imernes\nof free peoples. President Wilson\nhas pledged this nation to an auton\nomous Poland. The thousands of Poles\nwho sought freedom here, and found it.\nafter centuries of oppression, have\ndevoted their sons to the cause of de\nmocracy.

Byiogton, mayor of Reno,\nspoke on "Our Sialter Cities." Re\nferring with regret to the fact that\nthis was his first visit to southern\nNevada, which evoked his admiration\nand surprise and leading him to the\nconviction that the people of Reno as\nwell a the mining camps should de\nvote more time to cultivating ac\nquaintance t r both social and com\nmercial improvement.\n"War Work" was the toast assign\ned to S. A. Maglnnls, a brilliant\nyoung attorney of Utah, who did the\nsubject full justice In well-rounded\nperiods, dwelling on the necessity for\nthose standing behind the lines to\nlook after those who have gone to\nthe front.\nKraiik T. Dunn delivered one of\nbis most patriotic talks on "Patri\notism" closing with a toast to the\nulliea that brought every man to his\nfeet with an outburt of applause.\nCharles A. Magulre, of Ogden,\nUtah, was assigned to speak on "Our\nOrder," and dwelt long and earnestly\non what had been accomplished\nthrough the instrumentality of the\nKnights of Columbus, something that\ncould not have been done without\nsuch an organization to take the\nInitiative as they did when they en\ntered the recreational field with the\ntroops sent to the Mexican border\nand there established the experience\nthat was so useful after this country\nhad entered the war with Germany.\nThe speaker told of the results of\nfield service and the benefits derived\nfrom keeping open house In the can\ntonments where everybody was wel\ncome and no questions were asked\nabout a man\'s creed or antecedents.\nEvery man in the uniform of the\nUnited States was made welcome\nand treated with a spirit that made\nhim feel at home.\nLeonard B. Fowler, past state dep\nuty, of Reno, dwelt on the atrocities\nof the Hun and gradually led his\naudience back home where be urged\nthe value of active patriotism and\niealous effort in developing a sense\nof individual responsibility by each\nman and woman doing his or her\nshare in the .cause which all held\ndear to heart. He also drew a vivid\nword painting of the death of Sheriff\nVVIldea nd u,ged his listeners and\nthe state officers present to do all\ntheir power to establish a fund for\nthe erection of a monument to the\nfearless officer who fell doing his\nduty. -\nHon. P. J. McCarren, chief justice\nof Nevada, was at his best when sum\nmoned to speak, dwelling on the ur\ngency of the demands on the loyalty\nand patriotism of every-good Amerl\ncan citizen.\nJonn c. Martin spoke on "Th\nPress," referring to the mendacious\nreports affecting the fourth degre\nwhich had been declared the inner\ncircle of the order actuated Bolely\noy an impulse to place the pope in\npower in the United States and told\nof an experience in which one non\nCatholic editor met the proscription\nof Catholics as an anti-American\nmovement which should not have\nany recognition in this country.\nHon. Mark R. Averill was at his\nuesi m aeaitng wltn the concrete\nfacts of the war which, he said, did\nnot appear to appeal to the average\ncitizen wno would be shocked to\nMow that the allied nations engaged\nin opposing the Inroads of Prussian\nIsm represented over a billion peopi\ni wno naa made no headway up to date\nin resisting\' tha AnoFnankmt.\n" I\'"?\nL-.i.- . . .\n.,DUv, ul lura minority rorce\n.. ln ..,, ....\n\' me\nonly exception to the rule were a\nLw \' " 1\nUnri th honil v\nj pvncig ui Europe\nnose territory was insignificant\nyet no advance had been made ln the\npast tnree f.

Hart as an Ince-Artcraft star,\nwhich will be seen at the Butler to\nnight, for this story, "The Narrow\nTrail," was written by the famous\ninterpreter of the wild west himsel\',\nwho built it around a series of nar\nratives told him b\' a friend of ths\nearly pioneer days. Hurt mado a\nwhirlwind transcontinental trip. As\nthe Hunted was rushing through the\nDakotas it made few stops, but\nhalted for several minutes near\nStanding Rock In the heart of the\nDill Hurt country and close to the\nfirst settlement his father had lived\nin. When it moved on It carried an\nextra passenger, tall, rangy,\nweather-beaten old man who looked\nas though he might have been the\nearliest and last of the pioneers. He\ninquired if "young" Bill was aboard.\nThe aged man was Richard Wain-\nwrlght, who knew Hart\'s father well,\nand had given Bill his first lesson\nin horsemanship. Hart was a dash\ning cowpuncher in those days and\nwas the boy\'s ideal and model. It\nwas from this meeting, with the\nstories of the early days, that "The\nNarrow Trail" was evolved. It is a\ntypical Hart picture, and one that \'s\nabsolutely sure to please you. Hearst\nPathe News will also be shown.\nTomorrow, three features, three:\nJewel Carmen, in "The Bride of\nFear."

Averill, inrector, City.\nDear Judge: I beg to submit tho\nfollowing report on the flag pole for\nthe council of defense.\nMr. T. A. Frailer has complied\nwith your request and haa furnished\nthrough the Tonopah Mining com\npany a dandy flag pole which must\nhave caused Master Mechanic Bo\nzartn ana his assistant mechanics a\nlot of work and trouble. The pole is\n(8 feet long exclusive of the swivel\ntop and ball which In Itself turns on\nball-bearings and is really a work of\nurt. The pole was completed and put\ntogether In the Tonopah Mining com\npany\'s shops, and Friday night Chris\nDowler took the home guard up the\nhill and the guards carried the pole\nto its place on upper Main street,\nwhere John Delk had made all prep\naration for hoisting it Into position,\nwhich he did. Now what I wanta\nsay Is this: John is some class when\nit conies to doing things of a patri\notic nature and he staid with the\njob until it waa completed and an\nother thing there were several other\nreal patriotic guys on the Job when\nwe mixed the last batch of cement\nand they were George (John D.) Rose\nof Standard Oil fame, Chris Dowler,\ncaptain of the guard, Pete Beko, J.\nJ. Kelz, John Letho and Gus Niehaus.\nThere were about a hundred fellows\nhelping, but I did not check up until\nthe Job was finished.\nChris Dowler has donated a U. S.\nflag, Joe Michaels Is out after a\nFrench flag; Gus Petroni will get\nthe flag of Italy; Pete Beko will see\nthat Servia is represented, and 1\nhave an idea that all you have to\ndo is to speak to Mr. Robins and he\nwill get the flag of England, and\nmaybe we can have the flag raising\nblow-out about Memorial day.\nSincerely,\nLEE.\nand Retail\nCLASSIFIED\nMESSENGER SERVICE-For a rs\nliable messenger call Jack, at the\nCobweb. 1096F15td\nFOR SALE Heavy galvanized," cor \'\nrugated Iron.
