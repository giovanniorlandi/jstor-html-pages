        <pre>['169NEWS FROM EPS\nThe State of Play Across \nCentral and Eastern Europe\nEarlier this month the American \nPhysical Society organised a meeting in \nWashington to discuss international col\xad\nlaboration, and possibly the formation of \na world-wide physics council. Before the \nmeeting Dénes Nagy, Secretary General of \nthe Hungarian Physical Society, requested \na statement of present concerns from \nCentral and Eastern European (CEE) \ncountries, by writing to CEE Physical \nSocieties. The replies formed the basis of a \npresentation at the meeting in Washington \ngiven by Denis Weaire, the President of \nEPS. Here, Europhysics News publishes the \nmost interesting replies.\nRomania\nScience priorities in Romania \nAs the entire economy is in a process of \nprofound transformation, science is hardly \naccepted as a valuable partner in the mod\xad\nernisation and re-structuring effort. The \nold technology transfer links have disap\xad\npeared and new mechanisms designed in \nthe offices of the Ministry of Research and \nTechnology remain purely bureaucratic \nactions. It is a real danger that in the view \nof a large segment of the new political \nelite science appears mostly like a spiritual \nendeavour rather than a practical and \nlucrative activity. The R&D expenditure in \nRomania is one of the smallest in Europe \n(less than 0.5 per cent of the GDP) though \nthrough the inherited infrastructure, \npotential, past and recent results are com\xad\nparable even with those from many devel\xad\noped countries. As a result, scientists expe\xad\nrience a drastic reduction of expenditure \non equipment, materials, books and jour\xad\nnals, communications and travel - most of \nthe funds being directed towards dwin\xad\ndling salaries. In fact, a stable and sustain\xad\nable science policy, politically invariant, is \nmissing; long term strategic projects have \na formal character, aborted as soon as \nthey have been elaborated. This situation \nfavours confusion and arbitrariness of \ncentral administrative bodies with a \nprevalence and even exclusivity of the the\xad\nsis of bureaucracy and other non-scientif- \nic bodies (ie pseudo-scientific trade \nunions) over scientific bodies’ (scientific \ncouncils, professional organisations) rec\xad\nommendations.\nIn a period of crisis the scientific com\xad\nmunity finds itself divided between two \nextreme, exclusive positions. One regards \nscience as a purely curiosity driven activi\xad\nty, thus accepting global restrictions, but \nrewarded copiously with funds directed to \nthe few, mostly theoretical researchers - a \nprocess by which much of the existing, \npotentially profitable research infrastruc\xad\nture would disappear forever as would dis\xad\nappear any hope for oriented, economical\xad\nly ordered research. A second view \nattempts to preserve in the area of \nresearch and government the financing of \nsome activities outside the area of science. \nThis is still a remnant of another era when \nscience was regarded as a ‘production \nmeans’. This is, in fact, a very serious \nproblem and it can only be solved once \nthe government has created the frame\xad\nwork and mechanism for a ‘scientific’ \napproach to a science policy integrated \ninto European and developed-world scien\xad\ntific policy. An informed counselling and \nhonest peer review, un-biased by‘pro- \ndomo’ interests, appear absolutely neces\xad\nsary in the near future. Physics, chemistry \nand mathematics are probably the most \nopen areas and ready for serious scrutiny. \nHowever, if not the entire science sector \nand the entire R&D funding policy are to \nbe reviewed a punctual approach would \nbe suicidal.\nSo, to conclude these remarks, a new \nscience policy of the government is want\xad\ned, based, first, on the recognition of the \nrole of science in society and in the pre\xad\nsent era of general re-structuring by allo\xad\ncating a decent share of the budget; and \nsecond, on clearly stated long and medi\xad\num-term priorities and demands followed \nby a restructuring and re-orientation of \nresearch institutions - either professional \ninstitutes, university research, or acade\xad\nmia. Similar help can be offered within \ninternational scientific projects meant to \nrise and solve real needs of research estab\xad\nlishments and individuals.\nA. Calboreanu\nGeneral Secretary, Romanian \nPhysical Society\nBulgaria\nWe are especially interested in supporting \nthe re-establishing of pre-existing intra- \nCEE relations. Our Union used to have \nagreements for exchange of physicists for \nshort-term visits with all Eastern- \nEuropean countries, and we are struggling \nto revitalise these agreements.\nAdditionally, we are in big need of sup\xad\nport for subscriptions for leading journals \nin physics. There are rumours that the \nWorld Bank could provide such support, \nbut we do not know the details.\nEuropean Physical Society\nNews from EPS is published by Europhysics \nNews, reaching physicists across all of Europe\ne-mail eneditor@univ-mulhouse.fr\n34 rue Marc Seguin, F-68060 Mulhouse, France\ntel +33 3 89 32 94 44; fax +33 3 89 32 94 49\nFinally, the possibilities of marketing \nthe applied aspects of the scientific prod\xad\nucts of our members are of interest to us. \nAlexander Petrov \nVice-President, Union of Bulgarian \nPhysicists\nPoland\nConcerning all countries \nEstablishing a World-Wide Information \nand Advisory Centre for Physicists.\nThere are many initiatives which are \naimed at helping Third World, CEE and \nFormer Soviet Union Countries. \nUnfortunately, many of them are hardly \nknown, or if known, their regulations are \nfrequently not understandable for people \nfrom these countries.\nSuch a centre would make it possible to \nreach the information about aid proThere\nwill \nsoon be a \nlawyer \namong us. \nFind out \nwhy, turn \nto last page \nof News \nfrom EPS...\nEu\nrop\nhy\nsic\ns N\new\ns S\nep\ntem\nbe\nr/D\nec\nem\nbe\nr \n19\n97\n', '170\nNEWS  FROM  EPS\ngrammes, and not only by accidental or \nfriendship contacts with others. Moreover, \nit would also teach how to join the pro\xad\ngrams. It means that many programs, \nwhich seem to exist more for bureaucracy \nsatisfaction, would become more effective.\nCEE countries\nIt seems that many problems of physics \nand physicists in CEE countries and in the \nUSA, Japan and Western European coun\xad\ntries are similar or identical, except for the \nscale of economic difficulties.\nMajor problems are the disappointment \nand anxiety of societies concerning sci\xad\nence, and physics especially, and the lack \nof long term science policy of govern\xad\nments.\nThe current exchange of information \nand experiences concerning the situation \nand undertaken initiatives between all \norganisations is essential for solving the \nproblems which are common to all physi\xad\ncists around the world.\nOn the other hand, the physicists in the \nless economically developed countries, as \nthe CEE countries are, meet limitations \nwhich are unknown to physicists in rich \ncountries. The result of these limitations is \nthat the majority of physicists of CEE \ncountries have no possibility of doing \nresearch according to their capacities. The \nidea that reduction of these inequalities is \nnecessary and that it can be done only \nowing to international help is generally \naccepted. The question is how to do it \neffectively.\nIn our opinion the following activities \nare the most important ones for physicists \nand physics in CEE countries:\n• Supporting the joining of CEE countries \nto world-wide and European large scale \nfacilities (special membership fees and \nmobility funds, etc)\n• Considering the possibilities of setting\nup large scale facilities in CEE countries\n• Supporting the re-establishing of pre\xad\nexisting intra-CEE relations\n• Supporting the creation of centres of \nexcellence in CEE countries (a centre of \nexcellence is an extremely well \nequipped laboratory in which physicists \nfrom all over the world will have possi\xad\nbilities to do highly specific measure\xad\nments, as well as a theoretical centre \nwith excellent staff accepting young \nphysicists for training programs and \nadvanced scientists to do some \nresearch)\n• The restructuring of the EU grants to \nallow spending more money on basic \nresearch\n• Support establishing of the electronic \nversions of the most important physics \njournals published in CEE countries\n• Support the introduction of new elec\xad\ntronic technologies to libraries\n• Support programs for school teachers \n(international exchange, English cours\xad\nes, etc)\n• Continuing the sponsorship of partici\xad\npation of individual physicists in inter\xad\nnational conferences as well as organis\xad\ning such conferences in CEE countries.\nPhysics education and public education \nTopics: Physics Education at all levels \n(general, basic public education, university \nlevel, continuing, lifelong learning) in the \nmodern, knowledge-based, information \nsocieties and, for the next generation, the \nnew challenges for the physics education \nsystem in a rapidly changing world; and \nspecial needs for education reform in CEE \ncountries in accordance to their political \nand economic transformation.\nWe are currently facing a fast dropping \nof prestige for physics in all countries. \nYoung people treat physics as a boring and \nnot understandable subject. Generally \nthey do not want to learn physics. The \nnumber of physics students is systemati\xad\ncally decreasing. The most talented young \npeople prefer business, management and \nadministration instead of studying \nphysics. Governments and public authori\xad\nties are also not convinced about the fun\xad\ndamental and unique role of physics in \ncreating human culture, standard of living \nand in solving global problems such as \nenergy, environment, population, unem\xad\nployment, etc.\nTherefore, physical societies have to pay \nmore attention to the quality of physical \neducation of the generation. This includes \nthe stimulation of the development of\nsuitable educational programs (curricula), \nmodern teaching technologies (multime\xad\ndia, computer aided teaching, using the \nInternet), education and self-improvement \nof teachers. It requires strong collabora\xad\ntion in the integration of studies between \nphysical societies and related international \norganisations as well as universities and \nindustries all over the world. International \nexchanges of teachers and students is a \nkey-point of cooperation in this field. All \nabove mentioned activities should be car\xad\nried out and/or coordinated by physical \nsocieties or their special world-wide rep\xad\nresentative body.\nThe enterprises which have been \nalready undertaken, mainly under EPS \nauspices are the following:\n• Interdivisional Group on physics educa\xad\ntion activities (Forum on Education, \nUniversity Teaching Section)\n• EMSPS creation and activity\n• EUPEN foundation and activity\n• EPS Strategy Plan elaboration\n• SEFI Working Group on physics activi\xad\nties\n• PAC (Physics Action Council) of \nUNESCO - Working Group on \nUniversity Physics Education activities,\n• IUPAP Commission C14 on physics edu\xad\ncation activities,\n• European Parliament, Committee on \nCulture, Youth, Education and Media\nHenryk Szymczak\nPresident, Polish Physical Society\nSlovenia\nGeneral statements\nThe economic and the political transition \nin Slovenia, the transition in Eastern \nEurope (the break-up of the Eastern mar\xad\nket) and the disintegration of Yugoslavia \nfollowed by the war (and the break-up of \nthe Yugoslavian market), has meant that \none-fifth of workers have lost their jobs \nand that most factories have, in the pri\xad\nvatisation procedure, closed down their \nresearch laboratories or radically reduced \nthe number of researchers. Accordingly, \nless than one-sixth of researchers in \nindustrial laboratories have kept their jobs \n(from 8500 before the transition to 1300 \nnow).\nPhysicists are not in a better position. \nAnd the following are the consequences:\n• Young physicists do not have a good \nchance of getting a job in an industrial \nlaboratory. They could, by the support \nof the State and their University, start \ntheir own enterprises if they and the \nUniversity would only know how to do\nOrder your \nAPS journal \nat EPS rates, \nlast page...\nEu\nrop\nhy\nsic\ns N\new\ns S\nep\ntem\nbe\nr/D\nec\nem\nbe\nr 1\n99\n7\n', '171NEWS FROM  EPS\nit. (We have two universities but only \nthe University of Ljubljana has a physics \ndepartment.)\n• Possibilities for young scientists to get \npositions at institutes are also small. \nThere is less and less money for \nresearch from the State and accordingly \nfewer and fewer research positions.\nWhat can EPS and IUPAP do?\nThis year we cannot gather enough money \nto pay the membership fee for both the \nEPS and the IUPAP. We have paid the \nmembership fee for the EPS only. We have \nto kindly ask IUPAP to forgive us.\nWe also cannot pay our students to par\xad\nticipate in the EU Mobility Scheme (to go \nto other European universities for a year \nor a half of the year). We would need help \nto do this.\nSince basic research also has difficulties \nin Western countries, our government is \nanti-stimulated to support it. In spite of \nthat, it could help if the IUPAP, together \nwith the EPS, would recommend that our \ngovernment not reduce the money for \nbasic research, since new ideas come from \nthis field to the applied-research field.\nAnyhow, like in all countries, the \nresearch money is a small part of any \nState budget. In our country it is smaller \nthan in Western countries (a smaller per\xad\ncentage, that is).\nI believe that small countries, like \nSlovenia, have some hope to not complete\xad\nly disappear into the European communi\xad\nty, if the people of Slovenia are as much \neducated as possible. The universities, \ntherefore, need the basic research as well \nas the knowledge of how to create and \ntransfer applied knowledge to (small bou\xad\ntique) industry.\nSuggestions\nThe European (as well as World) Physical \nSociety could help in organising special \ncourses at universities, in which students \n(and teachers) would learn how a physicist \ncould create a knowledge needed to start a \nnew enterprise. There should exist also \napplied-research laboratories in physics \ndepartments.\nIt would help a lot if departments of \nphysics of different countries were more \nconnected, experiences were more shared, \nand teachers and students would commu\xad\nnicated more.\nNorma Borstnik\nPresident, Society of Mathematicians, \nPhysicists and Astronomers of Slovenia\nHungary\nFrom the 50s to the 80s, physics research \nwas mainly concentrated in a few research \ninstitutes at the Hungarian Academy of \nSciences, the largest being, with over 2000 \nmembers, the Central Research Institute \nfor Physics in Budapest. Since 1990, basic \nresearch has been permanently being \nshifted to the universities, and the \nAcademy of Sciences has lost already \nabout 30 per cent of its researchers. This \nprocess is still going on: the so-called‘con\xad\nsolidation program’ of the research net\xad\nwork of the Academy of Sciences implies \nfurther reduction.\nThe fact that pre-existing expertise has \nprobably suffered somewhat less than in \nsome other CEE countries is due to vari\xad\nous reasons:\n• Some active research groups have \nmoved from research institutes to uni\xad\nversities and other research institute \ngroups have also become part of uni\xad\nversity education and research pro\xad\ngrams.\n• Already in the 70s, Hungarian physicists \ndeveloped prosperous relations with \ntheir western colleagues. This still sig\xad\nnificantly increases the efficiency of \nbasic research.\n• Although many talented young physi\xad\ncists have left and are still leaving \nHungary for Western countries, both \nthe institutes, the universities and the \nphysical society take care to keep in \ncontact with them by inviting them to \ngive lectures, and by including them in \ncommon research projects, etc.\n• Hungarian physicists have over ten \nyears of expertise with research grant \nsystems. Therefore they are relatively \nsuccessful in applying for EU grants.\nIn spite of this, the basic problems of\nphysics in Hungary are not much different \nfrom those of other counties in the region. \nThere exists no long-term science policy \nof the government. Consequently, the \ninstitutes are unable to develop their own \nlong-term policies.\nThe R&D expenditure is about 0.5 per \ncent of the GDR Within this figure the rel\xad\native contribution of basic research is high \n(typical for countries with less-developed \nindustry and of low GDP) but its absolute \nsupport is still a factor of 10 to 15 less than \nin West European countries.\nThe institutes are unable to cover their \nown running costs. Therefore, successful \napplicants are charged with costs that nor\xad\nmally should be considered to be part of \nthe overhead (local telephone, bureau\nmaterials, liquid nitrogen, part of the \nsalaries, etc). As a rule, it is much easier to \nobtain money for investments than for \nrunning costs. And some new and expen\xad\nsive research equipment cannot be effi\xad\nciently used.\nThe grant system is only suitable for \nTittle science’. With the exception only of \nCERN experiments (Hungary is a full \nmember of CERN), no funding system \nexists for big science or, for experiments at \nlarge scale facilities. As for mobility costs, \nwe may expect some positive changes \nfrom the TMR program of the 5th \nFramework Program of the EU. Still, the \nquestion of the membership fees (ESRF, \nILL, etc) has to be solved.\nPre-existing intra-CEE links have suf\xad\nfered a lot. Although there exist inter-gov\xad\nernmental and inter-academy coopera\xad\ntions in the case of a few countries \n(Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Romania, \nSlovenia) we may speak of existing effi\xad\ncient links. Also, several GDR-links (now, \nof course, German-Hungarian coopera\xad\ntion) have survived. The biggest problem \nin this respect is the former Soviet Union. \nA typical problem of Russian-Hungarian \ncooperation is that the Russian party gets \nno funds from its own governments and \nis, therefore, unable to fulfil its duties to \nthe common research project. In view of \nthe exceptional experience and knowledge \nof most Russian physics institutes, this is a \ngreat loss to the science of the region. \nDenes Nagy (replying to his own letter) \nSecretary General, Roland Eötvös Physical \nSociety\nLouis Cohen Dies\nAt the end of July Alun Jones, Chief \nExecutive of the Institute of Physics (IoP) \nin London, wrote to the European Physical \nSociety with the sad news that Louis \nCohen had died on 28th July, 1997.\nCohen was a founder member of the \nEPS in 1968, and was largely responsible \nfor the creation of its constitution. He \nserved on the Executive Committee twice, \nfrom 1968 to 1973, and again from 1986 to \n1990.\nDenis Weaire, EPS President, has writ\xad\nten to the IoP to express his regrets, \n‘remembering a career dedicated to the \nphysics community at both national and \ninternational levels...Louis Cohen will be \nsadly missed.’ (TC)\nEur\noph\nysi\ncs N\new\ns S\nept\nem\nber\n/De\ncem\nber\n 19\n97\n', '172 NEWS   FROM  EPS\nThe 11th EPS \nGeneral Conference\nThe European Physical Society’s next big \nphysics shindig - an overview of physics \ndevelopments given at a week long confer\xad\nence every three years - will be held in \nLondon conference facilities close to the \nHouses of Parliament, Westminster, in two \nyears time.\nThe last party was held in Seville in \n1996.
