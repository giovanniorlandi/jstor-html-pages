Senate Demands\nDelay.\n14 EXEMPTIONS ARE GIVEN\nVital War Industries Escape Drastic\nRegulations—Only Food Stores\nWill Be Open on Mondays—\nPresident Stands Behind Aid.\nWashington, Jan. 18. —The Garfield\ncoal edict is in effect.\nDefying a resolution adopted by the\nsenate to compel a postponement of\nthe drastic measure, the fuel adminis\ntration gave notice that it stood pat.\nThe order was signed by Fuel Admin\nistrator Garfield at six o’clock last\nnight. It went into operation at mid\nnight.\nEvery industry east of the Mississip\npi river, including Minnesota and Lou\nisiana. with few exceptions, closed to\nremain idle until midnight next Tues\nday.\nWilson Stands Behind Garfield.\nBraving a storm of protest that\nswept the whole nation. President Wil\nson stood squarely by Dr. Garfield.\nMeanwhile opponents in the senate\nlashed themselves into a fury over\ntheir impotence. The Hitchcock reso\nlution to force a postponement was\nadopted by a vote of 50 to 19.\nA total of 14 exemptions was de\ncided on. They relate entirely to vi\ntal war industries. At the suggestion\nof the navy department the building\nof destroyers to meet the U-boats’ of\nfensive will not be interrupted. Elev\nen of the exemptions have to do with\nthis alone.\nAt the suggestion of the war depart\nment three exemptions were allowed.\nThere Is to be no interruption in the\nmanufacture of powder and heavy\nforgings needed for field guns.\nMay Continue Shipbuilding.\nIt was understood work on mer\nchant ship building also was to be ex\nempted.\nAll other industries covered in the\noriginal order outlined Wednesday\nnight must suspend entirely during\nthe five-day period beginning at mid\nnight.\nCall Is Necessary.\nThe order covers not only industries\nthat get heat or power from coal, but\nthose that use oil, electricity, natural\ngas, calcium or otherwise.\nWater power plants are not included.\n“It is a drastic remedy,” declared\nSecretary Daniels, “to meet a des\nperate situation. But if we hesitate it\nwill mean a more drastic remedy later\nfor a more desperate situation.”\nOnly the destroyer program. Secre\ntary Daniels said, the navy had asked\nto have spared.\n“Certain immediately necessary sup\nplies,” said Secretary of War Baker,\n“the army has asked to be exempted.\nOn the rest of the war supplies we\nmust stand by the order of the fuel\nadministration.”\nThe department of justice prepared\nto guard against any I. W. W. move\nment to fan the discontent of labor\nmade idle by the shutdown.\nIt was admitted the action was taken\nmore because of the congestion of the\nrailroads at seaboard terminals than\nbecause of shortage of coal.\nCongress Is Powerless.\n!♦ is not known whether congress\nwill take any further step to upset the\nedict. Congress’ only opportunity, ad\nministration officials declared, would\nbe to repeal the food law under which\nthe drastic step was taken. This would\nrequire weeks.\nEven if congress in its fury should\npass a repeal bill the president by\nwithholding his signature could defeat\nIts purpose.\nWild Days in Capital.\nSeldom has the capita.\' been through\nsuch a day.

A.\nGarfield to delay his order five days.\nThe vote, 50 to 19, was significant\nin that the majority Included several\nusually staunch supporters of Presi\ndent Wilson’s policies. Two radicals\nfrom the Republican side, Borah and\nLa Follette, supported the adminis\ntration.\nThe Hitchcock resolution, adopted\nby the senate by a vote of 50 to 19\nand ignored by Doctor Garfield, reads:\n“Resolved, That the fuel adminis\ntration of the United States be and is\nhereby requested to delay for five days\nthe order suspending the operation of\nindustrial plants in portions of the\nUnited States in order that protests\nmay he heard, investigation made and\ninformation presented.”\nSenator Reed of Missouri led the\nfinal attack on Doctor Garfield’s or\nder, with Senator Jones of New Mexi\nco essaying a defense.\nSenator Hitchcock offered his reso\nlution providing for fivt days delay\nin enforcing the order.\nSenator Hitchcock —“My resolution\nasks only for a delay of five days. I\ndo not assume to say that the fuel ad\nministrator has made a mistake. All\nI ask for is sufficient time to permit\nthe country to be heard from. The\nthing which he has done has been\nproperly denominated as a national\ndisaster. This thing has come upon\nthe country like a flash of lightning\nout of a clear sky. It means the clos\ning down of hundreds, and perhaps\nthousands of industrial establishments\nat a time when we have been strain\ning every effort to gain greater pro\nduction. It means the throwing out\nof work hundreds of thousands, and\nperhaps millions, of men whose wages\nare necessary to their daily subsist\nence.\n“I believe the country ought to be\ngiven an opportunity to present facts\nand protests if necessary. Possibly\nthe result may be a modification of the\norder. The interests are so tremen\ndous and the damages will be so enor\nmous that the five days ought to bo\nallowed.”\nU. S.

Recently Roumanian troops\nsurrounded and disarmed a Russian\nregiment.\nThe bolsheviki government retali\nated by arresting the Roumanian min\nister in Petrograd, Constantine Dio\nmondi, although he was released on the\ndemand of the diplomatic corps, head\ned by United States Ambassador Fran\ncis.\nAn ultimatum was dispatched to\nRoumania threatening the severest\nmeasures if Russia’s demands were\ntot complied with within 24 hours.\nBerlin, Jan. 18.—An official state\nment issued here giving the reply by\nthe central powers to the Russian pro\nposals at Brest-Litovsk on Monday\nsays the Russian terms concerning the\nregions occupied by the central powers\ndiverge to such a degree from the\nview\'s of the Teutonic league that in\ntheir present form they are inaccept\nable.\nWithdrawal of the Austrian and Ger\nman troops from the occupied terri\ntories while the war lasts is impossible,\nthe statement asserts.\nj\n:\n|\nThe Austrians and Germans, says\nthe statement, do not Intend to compel\nthe territories in dispute to accept this\nor that form of state, but they reserve\nfor themselves and the peoples of the\noccupied territories a free hand for the\n“conclusion of treaties of every kind,”\nU-BOAT CREW IN MUTINY\nTeuton Diver Crews Rise Against Kai\nser and Slay 38 Ranking\nSuperiors.\nLondon, Jan. 18.—A mutiny among\nsubmarine crews at the German naval\nbase of Kiel, January 7, is reported in\nan Exchange Telegraph dispatch from\nGeneva.

The ships were unable\nto compete the journey from our fac\ntories to the war depots behind the\nfiring line.\n“Added to this has been difficulty of\ntransporting coal for our own domes\ntic needs. On top of these difficulties\nhas come one of the most terribly se\nvere winters we have known in years,\n“The wheels were choked and\nstopped; zero weather has snow-bound\ntrains; terminals congested, harbors\nwith shipping frozen in rivers and\ncanals impassable. It was useless to\ncontinue manufacture and pile confu\nsion on top of confusion.\nEffect on\' Mines Disastrous.\n“A clear line from the manufactur\ning establishment to the seaboard and\nbeyond—that was the imperative need.\nIt was like soldiers marching to the\nfront The men of the foremost rank\nmust have room to move.\n“More than a shock was needed to\nmake a way through that congestion\nat the terminals and on the docks, so\nthat the aid so vitally needed by the\nallies could get through.\n“The incidental effect of this trans\nportation system on coal production\nhas been disastrous. There is and al\nways has been plenty of fuel, but it\ncannot be moved to those places where\nit is so badly needed while railroad\nlines and terminals are choked.\n“Throughout the coal fields scores,\neven hundreds of mines are lying Idle\nbecause of railroads’ inability to sup\nply the cars to carry away their prod\nucts.\nMust Pay Any Cost.\n“Coal mines cannot operate without\ncars. Cars cannot be supplied while\nthe railroads are crippled by the pres\nent freight congestion, which keeps\nIdle cars lying useless in the freight\nyards.\n“In the past week the production of\ncoal has been disastrously reduced.\nReports in some cases have shown 90\nper cent of the mines in certain fields\nclosed completely for the lack of cars.\n“This is war.

It has lately\nbeen expended upon an American resi\ndent in Rome who thinks himself a\nportrait painter, says a Rome corre\nspondent.\nThis gentleman, with the best inten\ntions, asked tiie pope for permission\nto paint his portrait, which would\nlater grace the walls of the Vatican,\nalongside of the masterpieces of the\nuniverse.\nThe pope granted the request, but\nstipulated that he should give only\none sitting, and that the portrait\nshould be finished by help of photo\ngraphs.\nThe portrait was finished recently.\nThe artist found it so good that he\nlonged to have it shown first in Amer\nica, lest his fellow citizens should re\nproach him for hiding such a work of\nart in Italy, without giving them a\nchance of admiring his genius. To this\nthe pope graciously agreed. But the\nartist went further.\nAs there are so many spurious por\ntraits of the pope, would his holiness\nwrite a few lines to prove to skeptical\nAmericans that the artist hud really\npainted the masterpiece? The pope\npromised a few' words in a few days.\nThey arrived. To the painter’s aston\nishment —and chagrin—they proved to\nbe from the Gospel of St. Matthew,\nchapter 14:27. They ran: “It is I; be\nnot afraid.”\nNot a Proposal.\n“Miss Gwendoline, I have something\nto say to you.”\n“Yes?”\n“I hardly know how to say it.”\nShe decided to help him a little.\n“One need have no hesitancy,” said\nshe, graciously, “in speaking freely to\none who feels toward you as I do.”\n“That’s what I thought. Well, you\nhave a little too much powder on your\nnose.”\nEverything In Its Place.\nWhen through with a thing put it\n; where it belongs, so you will know\njust where to go when you want it\nagain.\nBUILDING\nBOOSTER FOR BETTER ROADS\nDanger of Going Too Fast In Con\nstruction of Highways—Mistakes\nLiable to Be Costly.\nThe automobile is becoming a very\nImportant factor in the movement for\nbetter roads. Every auto owner, be he\nfarmer or city man, is a booster for\nbetter roads, but the city man is prob\nably more impatient with our present\nroads than the farmer. In our polit\nical life the farmer has always been\nthe conservative while the city man\nhas been the radical, the progressive.\nIt takes the two factions to bring\nppr wm\nm . ■3:\nQood Road in lowa.\nabout well balanced political condi\ntions ; one is us much needed as the\nothfer.\nSince the road supervisors at their\nIpgft annual meeting took the stand\nIW were not in favor of paving coun-\nItjr roads at the present at least, they\nhave b6en rather severely censured\nby the dally press and told that they\naye behind the times, trailing in the\ndust. That hard roads of some kind\nwill be built throughout the country\nsome time canuot be questioned, and\nthe supervisors recognized that fact\nwhen they said that they were not in\nfavor of loading the counties down\nwith road debts at the present time.\nWe are inclined to commend the su\npervisors for the stand they took, be\ncause there is danger of going too fast\nwith expensive methods of construc\ntion until the different kinds of roads\nthat are practicable for different lo\ncalities have been more fully tested,\nsays Farmer and Breeder. Mistakes\nmade in permanent road construction\nare liable to be rather expensive.\nlowa has made rapid progress in\nroad improvement during the past two\nyears, and while no permanent roads\nhave been built the work of grading\nand draining at least two principal\nroads through each county and the\nconstruction of cement culverts and\nbridges is something that will have to\nbe done everywhere before permanent\nroads can possibly be built. Then, too,\nin many sections at least, when our\nroads are brought to a grade, are well\ndrained, and then properly cared for\nwith the road drag, they become very\npassable indeed. We believe that it is\nnot a bad plan to use them for a few\nyears in that condition and give the\ndrag a good chance to show what it\nwill do for them w’hen used as fre\nquently as it should be.\nBUILDING MORE GOOD ROADS\nEnormous Increase in Total Expendi\ntures for Highways and Con\nstruction of Bridges.\n“There has been an enormous in\ncrease in the total expenditures for\nroad building and bridge construction\nmarking the development of highway\nwork in the United States during the\npast 12 months,” said J. A. Rountree,\nsecretary of the United States Good\nRoads association.\n“Statistics compiled and reports re\nceived at the headquarters of the Unit\ned States Good Roads association show\nthat the expenditures for the building\nof good roads and bridges for the year\n1915 were $282,000,000, or an Increase\nof 250 per cent over the amount spent\nfor similar purposes in 1914. In ad\ndition, more than $27,000,000 of local\nfunds were spent under state super\nvision In 1915, bringing the total road\nand bridge expenditures managed by\nthe states to $80,514,099. This amount\nis greater than the total expenditures\nfor roads and bridges from all sources\nIn 1904.”\nGalvanized Iron Culverts.\nThe cost of high-grade, pure iron\ngalvanized culverts is not more than\n10 per cent higher than ordinary steel,\nand experts claim the life of the pure\niron to be many times that of ordinary\nsteeL\nCulverts Too Short.\nDo not get your culvert too short.\nBe sure that it extends the full dis\ntance of the road embankment.

This is true whether the\nappointment is made by the president\nhimself, or by the governor or any\nother officer of any state or territory.\n“Failure or neglect fully to perform\nany duty required of such public of\nficial or agent is a misdemeanor and\npunishable by imprisonment for not\nmore than one year.”\nUnder section 49 of the regulations,\nit is made the duty of police officials\nof any state, or county, or municipal\nity, or other subdivisions thereof, to\nlocate and take into custody regis\ntrants who have failed to perform any\nduty required of them and to bring\nthem forward before local boards to\ndetermine whether their cases shall\nbe reported to the Federal Depart\nment of Justice for prosecution, and\nto serve the summons to witnesses is\nsued by local or district boards as\nprovided in section 9 hereof.\nThe regulations define “police of\nficials” as mentioned above to “in\nclude all United States and state,\ncounty, and municipal marshals and\nsheriffs and their deputies, police,\nconstables and the constabulary, and\nall other similar officers by whatever\nname known, having authority to\ntake persons into custody in order to\npreserve the peace anrf quiet of the\ncommunity and to maintain public or\nder and tranquility.”\nThere is no provision under the\nregulations for the payment of police\nofficials for the service required of\nthem in the regulations. It is ex\npected that local communities will be\nglad to co-operate with the Federal\ngovernment by rendering this service\nrequired of their officials without ex\ntra compensation from the Federal\ngovernment.\nLocal boards should, of course, as\nfar as possible, call into its service\npolice officials who will be least in\nconvenienced by the request, but the\nduty is placed upon local boards to see\nthat the law is fully complied with and\nto secure the co-operation of local po\nlice officials for this purpose. Failure\nof police officials to comply with the\nrequests of local boards should be re\nported to the governor’s office with a\nfull stat ement of the facts for refer\nence where advisable to the United\nStates district attorney.\nThrough the local press, it is ad\nvisable that the attention of police of\nficials be called to the terms of Sec\ntions 49, 50 and 51 of the Regulations.\nIT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORT\nANCE THAT THIS MEMORANDUM\nBE GIVEN THE WIDEST PUBLIC\nITY.

Selections of the works\nof American composers were render\ned. A fairly representative gathering\nwas present. The must; interesting\nnumber was the rendition of Skilton’s\nDeer Dance by a string quartet com\nposed of R. A. Buell. F. Henke, P.\nCollins and R. Spangenberg. The deer\ndance is a feature of the annual mem\norial services of the Rogue River tribe\nin Oregon, for those departed during\nthe year. After a. short mournful mel\nody by the chief singer and women,\nthere is a commemorative speech by\nthe chief, suggested by the violoncello\nsolo, and the dancing begins. The\nsingers render a melody in two-four\ntime while the drums play in three,\nfour, not an uncommon effect in In\ndian music. The viola playing pizzi\ncuto gives the effect of the drum.\nWhile this is going on the dancers\npass in and out showing the specta\ntors how the hunter pursued the deer\nand other exploits of the departed.\nThe number is typical of Indian music\nand exemplifies and illustrates the\nmode of Indian music.\nMiss Ruth Wilkowski read a paper\non Indian and negro elements in Am\nerican muse. She stated that Indian\nmusic has played no part in the de\nvelopment of American music. It is\ninteresting and is now becoming of\nhistorical value for the Red man is be\ning driven to either accept the white\nman’s ways or become more scarce\neach day. With the going of the In\ndian is his music. The chief use of mu\nsic by them was to make more impres\nsive their tribal customs. In speaking\nof the negro and his music the speaker\ngave a clear, concise view of what his\nmusic has done for us. With his com\ning in 1619 he brought many crude\nsongs w’hich later were accepted as\nbeing expressive of American music.\nThe negro through his music has ex\nerted an influence that is far reaching\nfor to him we owe muon ror the popu\nlar music of today.\nMiss lona Bingham then delivered\ntwo decalogues, “Noddin’ by the Fire”\nand “In the Morning.” Both selections\nwere well rendered. Miss Bingham\npossesses the power of character por\ntrayal in a remarkable degree. Her\nwork is commendable and and was\nwell received.\nMiss Ramona Williams read a paper\non American composers, choosing Bud\nMcDowell and Nevins. She spoke on\nthe composers as a whole, telling what\nthey had done for American music. In\nspeaking of Carrie Jacobs Bond, Miss\nWilliams stated that we had reason to\nbe more than interested in her for she\nis a Wisconsin product, having been\nborn in Janesville. Her works such\nas “Perfect Day” and “Just a Wearyin’\nfor You” will remain as standard for\nmany years to come.\nMiss Mary Ladwig rendered two se\nlections, “From the Land of thte Sky\nBlue Water,” and “Daisies,” all in her\nusual charming manner.\nMiss Mary Conway favored McDow\nell, playing his “To a Wild Rose,” dif\nficult and melodious, in a faultless\nmanner.\nMiss Ruby King sang “If I were\nKing.” The selection is one that gives\nthe artist a rare opportunity to show\nher vocal power. Miss King ably\nproved that she w\'as well capable to\nsing the selection. The next number,\na comical song. “If I Were a Duck\nling.” was roundly applauded.\nMiss Florence Amadon concluded\nthe program by playing two fine solos,\n“The Shepherd’s Tune” and “The\nRosary.” Both numbers were well\nplayed, the player showing a finesse\nin touch and technique and executed\nthem faultlessly.\n—o—\nThe program of the Forum Debat\ning society for January 29 is one on a\ntopic of interest to all.\nCurrents by Neil Werner is the first\nnumber on the program.\nDebate, “Resolved, That suffrage be\ntaken from the negroes in the south\nern states,” will be defended by H.\nBredow, G.

Please\ncan’t I stay up till Jimmy is ready?”\n“No, Buddy; Jimmy has his lessons\nto get and it may take him two hours.”\n“Well, can’t somebody come up in\nthe hall with a light and wait till I get\nundressed?” pleaded Buddy.\n“Why, Buddy! Whatever is the mat\nter with you this evening? You’ve\nfidgeted around for the last hour as if\nyou were on a hot griddle,” spoke his\nmother.\n“Huh 1 Should think I would!” mut\ntered Buddy.\n“He can’t get his snowhouse In the\nyard ofTn his mind,” piped Jimmy.\n“He’s been going to the window to look\nout at it every two minutes.”\nBuddy’s eyes expressed a queer\nglare, for Just now he was distinctly\nedging away from the window. His\nspinster aunt. Miss Cordelia, spoke up\nin her kind, patient way:\n“Perhaps Buddy is worrying for fear\na thaw will come and undo all his hard\nwork on his Esquimaux hut.”\n“No, I ain’t,” dissented the lad mam\nblingly.\n“Well, Buddy, I’ll come and sit in\nthe old lumber room next to yours and\nResembled Some Rugged Laplander.\nset the lamp in the hall till you get\ntucked in and sound asleep.”\n“I wouldn’t humor the boy that way,\nif I were you, sister,” said Buddy’s\nmother.\n“Oh, boys have their nervous whims,\njust like us older ones,” replied toler\nant and indulgent Aunt Cordelia.\nThe good soul was right, and Buddy\nmade a confidant of her as they went\nup the stairs.\n“Aunt Cordelia, they’d all tease me\nbut you, and laugh at me, but I saw a\nghost out of the window in the yard.”\n“Oh, Buddy!” rallied his aunt.\n“Yes, sir, twict!” asserted Buddy in\nan awesome way.\n“Nonsense, Buddy! What particular\nshape did this wandering spirit of\nyours take?”\n“He was an Esquimaux,” asserted\nBuddy, solemnly. “He had a big bear\nskin robe all over him. First he was\ndodging behind the ice hut we built\nyesterday. Next time I saw him at\nthe window. He had his face close to\nthe pane and he was looking in. He\nwas looking straight at you, oh, sure\nhe was!”\n“Dear me!” fluttered Aunt Cordelia,\nwith a little shiver. She had no belief\nin ghosts, but Buddy’s grewsomeness\nhad begun to affect her. “It was prob\nably some of your playmates dressed\nup in the old buffalo robe your father\nloaned you,” she said. “Come, Buddy,\npop into bed now,” and she placed the\nlamp at the head of the stairs so that\nit shed its rays into Buddy’s room.\nThen Miss Cordelia went down the\nhall and entered an old storeroom and\nwent to the window and looked out at\nthe snowhouse, and swept the garden\nspace with her glance.\n“What foolish notions children\nget,” she murmured. “Oh, coming in\nhere reminds me I must get another\nhank of yarn,” added this indefatiga\nble knitter.\nTHIS WAR HAS ESTABLISHED THE CIGARETTE\nAS SOLDIERS SMOKE-GOOD REASONS WHY\nThe story has been told of a Civil War officer who won the admiration\nof his men during a hard battle when he braved a rain of bullets and stood\nat the head of his command, calmly loading a huge briar pipe from a sack\nof tobacco hung from his belt.\nTobacco has always been an important factor among fighting men;\nbut its forms of use have changed.\nRecently we read of an English officer whose friends paid him this\ntribute: “He stood in the thick of shell fire smoking cigarettes and giving\norders as calmly as though he might have been in his club at home.”\nSo, the cigarette has come to the front in this latest and hardest of\nwars.\nThere are many reasons which fall in line with the modern trend to\nward efficiency in battle —reasons which have made the cigarette the mod\nern military smoke everywhere.\nCigars, for instance, are hard to carry; they will dry quickly and after\na hard march will often look more like a pocketful of corn flakes—one\nsoldier remarks—than like a good smoke. Naturally thousands of men\nare devoted to their pipes—but for quick action and convenience the cigar -\nette has many advantages.\nWhile cigarettes are easily carried, remain fresh longer and afford the\nquick-action smoke which has become the universal favorite among men at\nthe Front.\nSo come along with your quarter and send a kit of cigarettes and\ntobacco to the Front.\nEnclosed Hud to buy packages of tobacco for\nAmerican Hghtlng men In France.\nI understand that each dollar buys four packages, each with a retail val\nue of 45 cents, and that in each of my packages will be placed a postcard,\naddressed to me, on which my un- known friend, the soldier, will agree\nto send me a message of thanks.\nName\njtftfc'- ...\n, , y Address\nCity\nShe fumbled around on the shelf\nwhere she supposed a certain box con\ntaining the yarn was located, and\ncould not find it lu the dark. Going\nto the door she took a match out of a\nbox tacked to its inside frame, kept\nalways full. Aunt Cordelia flared the\nmatch, found the yarn and dropped the\nmatch as Buddy called out, in a tone\nmuffled because he probably was hid\ning his head under the bedclothes:\n“All right, Aunty—l’m in.”\nAs the last member of the family\nwent upstairs to bed there crept out\nthrough the small semicircular door\nof the snowhouse a human figure. It\nwas that of a man who was enveloped\nin the buffalo robe and resembled some\nrugged Laplander. He edged to the\nshelter of some trees and stood there\nmotionless. His eyes were fixed on the\nwindow of the only one of the\nupper rooms which had a light in it.\nIt was that of Aunt Cordelia. She\ncame to the window in full view and\npulled down the shade. The watcher\nuttered a deep sigh. Now he retreated\ntowards the hut and sat down on a\nsnow hummock.\n“They have all gone to bed,” he\nsoliloquized. “It’s safe for me to ven\nture. She has left the window up from\nthe bottom a few Inches for ventila\ntion, and the space is big enough to\npass the letter through.”\nThe man now removed the robe from\nhis shoulders, thrust it out of view in\nside the snow hut and took from his\npocket a sealed envelope. This he\nplaced between his teeth, approached\nthe house and began a hand-over-hand,\ncareful and noiseless ascent of a broad\ntrellis which very nearly traversed the\nentire side of the house. Inch by inch\nhe clambered, lintil his face was oppo\nsite the open window space. He freed\none hand to remove the letter from his\nteeth and slipped it through the aper\nture.\nThe stranger was about to descend\nwhen a sudden glow crossed his face.\nIt died down, then suddenly It flared\nup more brilliantly than before. Curi\nous, and at the same time somewhat\nstartled, the man threw back his head\nto obtain a clearer range of vision. It\nwas to discover a heap of rubbish in\nthe storeroom which Aunt Cordelia had\nvisited two hours previous bursting in\nto a blaze.\nThe man was deft and agile. He\nrapidly marked a course sideways to\nwards the window of the lumber room.\nThe smoldering and blazing heaps in\nthe apartment told him that here was\nno casual problem to deal with. He\nbraced his feet as he got directly op\nposite the window. He could not lift\nthe sash from the outside.\n“Fire ! Fire ! Fire !” he yelled at the\ntop of his voice, intent on arousing the\nsleeping inmates of the house. Then\nhe gave his body a forcible, forward\nlurch. It impelled him through the\nlower frame of the window with a\nheavy crash, carrying the splintered\nsash with him.\nThe man landed on the floor Inside\namid a shower of putty, glass and\nwood. He was speedily on his feet.\nHe kept up his shouting, but doubly\nactive the while. Some smoking bits\nof carpet he lifted and flung through\nthe window out upon the snow-covered\nground. A mass of old papers and\nmagazines the stuff had covered.burst\nforth into vivid flame. He was\nscorched, half blinded, breathless, but\nhe kept on throwing out the blazing\nrubbish about him.\nNow he wavered and uttered chok\ning gasps. He felt that the smoke, cin\nders and heat were about to overcome\nhim. He was about to abandon the un\nHOME WANTED BV A BABV\nequal battle when he noticed two tin\njacketed cans, the outside of which\nwere smoking and shooting out spas\nmodic streaks of flame.\n“Kerosene, gasoline!” he panted des\nperately, and dashed at them. One\nafter the other they hurtled through\nthe window. Then a great blaze of\nlight outside and an echoing explosion.\nThe brave fire-lighter staggered to\nwards the door. He threw the weight\nof his powerful frame against It. The\ndoor gave way. He went with it pros\ntrate In tiie hall, and over him, attract\ned to the spot by ids warning cries and\nthe accompanying commotion, stum\nbled Mr. Porter.\nThen the calls of the latter brought\nall hands under the roof to the scene.\nIt was an exciting five minutes, while\nMr. Porter beat out the flames and the\nother members of the household\nbrought water and dashed It on the dy\ning embers.\nMr. Porter carried the insensible\nman .on his shoulders into a vacant\nbedroom. At a glance he saw that this\nincidental saver of his property, and\nprobably of life, was seriously burned.\nBuddy hurried on his clothes and ran\nfor a doctor.\nIt was daylight when Aunt Cordelia\nfound the letter lying on the floor of\nher room. She opened it to regard its\ncontents with dilating eyes and a\nquickly paling face. A romance five\nyears dead, the details of which she\nhad never imparted to a single soul,\nwas revived with a strangeness and\nforce that made her sway to the point\nof fainting.\n“I am all through with the drink,”\nit read. “I am a changed man, have\nmade my way in the world and am\ndriven to see you, if only at a distance,\nonce more. Of course you have long\nsince forgotten me, but if my peni\ntence and my redemption appeal to\nyou in the slightest degree send me a\nsingle line to the address I give and I\nwill hasten to see you openly.”\nWhat her answer would be, the\nglowing eyes, the kiss she bestowed\nupon those cherished wTitten lines, her\ntears, presaged clearly. She was\ncalled by her brother into the hall.\n“The doctor says our patient will be\nall right in a day or two, and is com\nfortably resting now,” Mr. Porter said.\n“Will you sit by him, Cordelia, until\nmother gets breakfast over?”\nRandolph Waters looked up from the\ncouch upon which he lay as Cordelia\nentered the room. She made no pre\ntense of affectation, or shyness, or\naversion.\n“Randolph!” she said, and sat down\nbeside him and caressed the bandaged\nhand. “You were the ghost little Bud\ndy saw at the window? You just in\ntime discovered the fire my careless\nness caused?”\nHe smiled an assent, hope and com\nfort compassing him. She leaned to\nwards him and kissed him on the\ncheek,\n“That is the answer to your letter,”\nsaid Aunt Cordelia simply.\nWhere Are the Germans, Mamma?\nMother’s four-year-old is very much\nInterested in the war. He often hears\nhis father reading the war news.\n“What is a fort?” he asked his mam\nma, recently.\n“There is one near the city,” the\nmother said. “I’ll take you out there\nsome day,” and she kept her word.\nWhen the faur-year-old had seen the\nbuildings and the soldiers drilling, and\nmother had explained to him the ob\nject of the training, the little lad\nasked:\n“But where are the Germans, mam\nma ?” —Indianapolis News.\nSUNDAY SCHOOL\nLesson 3~First Quarter, Janu\nary 20, 1918.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL SERIES\nText of the Lesson, Mark 1:21-34\nMemory Verse, Gal. 6:2— Golden\nText, John, 9:4— Commentary Pre\npared by Rev. D. M. Stearns.\nThis lesson might be entitled, “Some\nof the Words and Works of Jesus\nChrist,” and the Golden Text should be\nas true of his followers as of himself,\nfor he said to his father, “As thou hast\nsent me into the world, even so have I\nalso sent them into the world,” and\nafter his resurrection he said to his\ndisciples, “As my father hath sent me,\neven so send I you.” (John 17-18; 20-\n21. As to his own words and works\nhe said, “The words that 1 speak unto\nyou I speak not of myself; but the fa\nther that dwelleth in me, he doeth the\nworks.” (John 12 ;49-50; 14:10.) When\ntherefore we read in lesson verses 21,\n22, that he taught them as one that\nhad authority, we see why; and we\nshould lay to heart 1 Pet. 4:11, “If\nany man speak, let him speak as the\noracles of God.” See also Ex. 4:12;\nJer, 1:7-9; Phil. 2:13; Co*. 1:29.\nIn the rest of our lesson chapter we\nsee him casting out demons, healing all\nmanner of diseases, and even leprosy,\nas it is written in Matt. 4:23, “And\nJesus went about all Galilee, teaching\nIn their synagogues, and preaching the\nGospel of the Kingdom, and healing all\nmanner of sickness and all manner of\ndisease among the people.” In Matt.\n5 to 7 we have the laws or life of the\nkingdom, and in Matt. 8 and 9 as in to\nday’s lesson some samples of kingdom\nhealth, for when the kingdom comes\nthe inhabitant shall not say, “I am sick\n—and the people that dwell therein\nshall be forgiven their iniquity.” (Isa.\n33 :24.)\nIt seems strange that while men do\nnot know this Holy One of God, the\ndemons know him (vs. 24, 34). It is\nwritten. “The demons believe and\ntremble” (Jas. 2:19). It is still true\nthat men, women and children are oft\ntimes possessed by evil spirits, and\nblamed for what the evil spirits say\nand do through them. To bring them\nto Jesus would be better than finding\nfault with them, for he is still the\nsame Jesus, and as able to cast out\ndemons as when on earth In his humili\nation. But we must remember, as we\nsaw in last w r eek’s lesson, that the\nkingdom has not come yet, and king\ndom conditions can only be by special\ngrace, and foreshadowings of the fu\nture. As to his authority (vs, 22, 27)\nhe is in the place of all power at the\nfather’s right hand, and when we are\nreally and whole-heartedly here for\nhim and his affairs, we may hear him\nsay, “Concerning the work of my hands\ncommand ye me,” (Isa. 45:13). Les\nson verses 29-31 introduce us to the\nhome of Simon Peter whose wife’s\nmother lay sick of a fever. It was a\npoor time to bring company home\nfrom church, some might have thought\nand said; but as no remarks are re\ncorded from Peter’s wife on this occa\nsion, we may suppose that she was\nglad to see her husband’s friends even\nthough her mother was sick. If she\ndid not entertain angels by her hos\npitality, she received the Lord who has\nthousands of thousands ministering to\nhim, and she must surely have been\nglad all her days, and to this present\ntime, and forever, because of him who\ncame to her home that day. Immedi\nately, as he took the sick one by the\nhand, she w r as well, perfectly well, no\nslow and gradual recovery, and helped\nPeter’s wife to minister to her visitors.\nSee Heb. 13:2, and compare the story\nin Gen. 18.\nWhat multitudes of people were\nmade glad, and homes made happy,\nthat evening, by him who is the source\nof all health and happiness and peace\nand joy, who will finally banish all sor\nrow, and crying, and pain, and death\nfrom the whole earth (vs. 32-34). No\ndoubt he slept after the labors of such\na day and evening, for his body was\nmortal and he was often weary, and on\none occasion we find him sleeping in\nthe midst of a great storm. In the\nmorning, a great while before day, he\nwas away in a solitary place, in com\nmunion with his Father, for that was\nmore to him than aught else (vs. 35)\nand it should be so to us also. Simon\nand the others having found him, and\ntold him that many were seeking him,\nhis reply was, “Let us go Into the next\ntowns for therefore came I forth.” We\nshould consider whether we are ever\nministering to the same people, or\nreaching new people.\nIn his journeyings a leper came to\nhim with great faith saying, “If thou\nwilt thou canst make me clean.” He\nsurely believed that nothing was too\nhard for such a wonder worker (Jer.\n32:17, 27; Gen. lt':14), and he was not\ndisappointed.
