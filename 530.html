This often happens\nin connection with ‘mild’ attacks in\nwhich the real nature of the disease is\nnot understood. The illness is not\nsevere, the doctor is not called, and no\nprecautions are taken to prevent the\ndisease from spreading to others.\n“Every case of a ‘catching’ d sease is\na possible source of danger to others,\nand an outbreak can spread just as\nireadily from a ‘mild’ case as from a\nmore severe one. Because of the\nclose association of children in schools\n, and in their play, the catching diseases\nspread among them, as a forest fire\n! spreads acrossthe timberland.\n■‘Children’s diseases could very truth\n, fully be labeled the ‘damaging’ diseases.\nVery often they leave after-effects in the\nway of damaged hearts or kidneys, or\nthey are the cause of other handicaps.\n. On that account, such diseases are not\ni to be treated lightly. Whenever a child\n. is droopy or below par, the safest thing\n[ for any mother to do, is to put the child\nj to bed, keep the other children away\nr from him, send for the doctor and to\nj follow his advice. In that way she will\nprotect her own child and the rest of the\nhousehold. She will safeguard her\nj neighbor’s child as well.’*\n’ READ THE ADS\nj IN THE INDEPENDENT\nI. ■\nQ\nv Thirty Years Ago :::\ne—\n\'\nMr. Hopper, of Baltimore, spent Sun\nday at “Nelton.”\nMr, J.

BOWLING\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 9. 1934\nLINCOLN’S BIRTHDAY\no\nOn February 12 the Nation will celebrate the one hundred and\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.\nEveryone has heard of Lincoln’s boyhood spent in the backwoods\nof Kentucky, his simple life, his yearning for knowledge and his pro\nverbial honesty.\nThe Lincoln Memorial and hundreds of smaller monuments and\nstatues throughout the United States bear testimony to the apprecia\ntion of the American People.\nAbraham Lincolm represents for all time the Republican Party,\nand each member of that Party should feel honored to belong to the\nsame organization as the Great Emancipator and strive to imitate his\nlofty ideals and sterling character.\nIt was truly a New Deal that Lincoln gave the American Negro\nwhen in the name of Justice to the human race he issued his Emanci\npation Proclamation. The appreciation of this great event should be\nforever stamped in the hearts of our Negro citizens.\nLincoln laid down his life that these United States might be pre\nserved. During his administration the fate of our Nation hung in the\nbalance. On the one hand chaos. On the other re-union and recon\nstruction Had the Union Lost, this country could never have been as\nit is today, one of tbe greatest if not the greatest nation on earth. No\nperiod, before or since was as critical as the days of the Civil War.\nNo one will ever know w hat the great man suffered during that\nawful time. Sleepless nights and feverish days, yet through it all he\nprayed to the Master of all for light and courage to guide and strength\nen him.\nLincoln’s conception of government was that which represented all\nthe people for the peoples’ sake and for their benefit alone.\nWe have a government of the people and by the people, but have\nwe one for the people. The interest of the average man docs not con\ncern our honorable statesmen. The wise politicians only object is to\ngain wealth and power for himself and he soon forgets the sacred duty\nwith which his honest feliow citizens entrusted him. Abraham Lin\ncoln was not of this type. His own interests meant nothing to him\nwhen the welfare of his neighbor was at stake.\nLet every American on February 12 remember Abraham Lincoln\nand resolve to imitate his virtues and thank the Almighty for giving\nhim to our Nation.\nC. C. LANCASTER\nRock Point, Md.\nWICKER ON LIQUOR\n(From The Baltimore Sun) • \'\n0\nState Senator Wicker, of Virginia, thinks he sees a considerable\nsentiment for “Virginia Liquor for Virginians” and his proposed bill\nto make that sublime ideal a legal reality. Senator Wicker wants the\nState to monopolize the manufacture of liquor, using only Virginia pro\nducts in the process. This, he feels, will preserve the health of Virgin\nians and solve the bootlegging problem.\nIt must be said for this suggestion that it is in line with most of\nthe economic reasoning of the time. Every country is trying something\nof the sort and now that Mr. Wicker has broken the ice by applying\neconomic nationalism to a lesser political division, we may expect the\nmovement to go through to its logical conclusion: Richmond liquor\nfor Richmonders, Fifth Ward Booze for Fifth Warders, Bathtub Gin\nfrom our own Bathtub. Of course, when you reach the final step in\nthis chain of reasoning, it becomes evident that the patriotic home\nmaker of bathtub gin will eventually have to go out and import some\nalcohol. The Fifth Warders will reach the same necessity some time\nand even the Old Dominion would eventually tire of making its entire\nsupply, just as the United States tired after two or three days of reso- ,\nlution.\nFor our part, we should prefer the normal arrangement by which ,\nwe could swap a little Maryland rye for some Virginia hams, but if\nVirginia insists on making all her own liquor Maryland will probably j\nhave to raise all her own hams. This is not intended as an unfriendly i\nremark, but as a repitition, however boring and unpleasant in these j\ndays of “planning,” of a simple economic reality.\ni\nSi\n<\ni\n(\n1\nAgenf Sinclair Refining Company [lnc.)\nB.

The first of\nthese provided that\n’ _ control of the $2,000,-\n, Senator olaaa 000.000 stabilization\nfund should be given to a board\ncf five instead of to the secretary\nof the treasury. This was defeat\ned by the votes of 50 Democrats,\nthree "radical’\' Republicans and the\nsingle Farmer-Labor senator. The sec\n? ond amendment offered was put for\nward by the silver bloc and was\nbeaten only by the assistance of 17\nRepublican senators, for 28 Detno\n, crats were recorded in favor of it and\nthe vote stood 43 to 45.

When he started out to ex\nplore the ramifications of the CWA Com\nmittee’s activities with the view of\nbuilding up a defense for himself and\nthem, he overlooked the possibility\nof winding up at the end of a blind alley,\nwhere he now finds himself. He should\nhave at once retreated, but instead un\ndertook to butt down the obstruction.\nHe now somewhat belatedly, however,\nseems ready to capitulate, but wants to\nmake his own terms. I, on the other\nhand decline, to enter into a truce with\nhim. until I am convinced that he is\nthrough bucking the unbeatable forces\nof truth and justice.\nBut he, of a sudden, has become a\nstickler for truth and veracity, and I\nmust produce “the names of the men\nand women who have been employed or\ndischarged in the CWA activities of this\nCounty, at our instance or dictation\' , or\n1 must “stand convicted before the bar\nof Justice in all Charles County, of will\nfully and falsely attempting to deceive :\na people who have honored him.” All i\nof which is a priceless sample of the\nsophistry that is reserved only for the\nlips of a prince of quibbles to utter.\nWhy, Sir, the Editor knows I have no list .\not the unemployed from which to take ■\nnames. He knows that there is no origi\nnal list by which to account for the men\nand women at work. Of course, there\nis a “doctored” list covering the favori\ntism used in the irregular manner of th e\nemployment, but I shall decline giving\nnames of anybody employed or discharg\ned at the pleasure of the Editor, for the\nquite patent reason that I will not ex\npose any person already in distress to\nthe consequences of certain wrath that\nwould flow from such indiscretion. And\nit is not necessary for the Editor to\n* dictate” for or against anyone seeking\nemployment under the Committee.\nEverybody, fami iar with the Editor’s\ndisposition knows that his will must be\nobeyed, and everbody subject to him\nmakes sure that his w ishes are carried\nout as a matter of course. Now, Mr,\nEditor, i feel that I have temporized\nwith the Senior Editor of the Times-\nCrescent, in this CWA matter as long\nas might be expected. And he must be\nbrought at once to realize that honest\nand honorably circumstanced men of\naffairs will not take kindly to having\ntheir regard for “truth and veracity”\ndragged down to the level of one who\ndoes not respect the oath of office as\nSenator of a sovereign State: and unless\nand until this party, the Sr. editor of the\nTimes Crescent and the representative\nof the people of Charles County in the\nSenate of Maryland, takes the trouble\nto show that he has by his official acts\nshown that he does respect such oath,\nI shall disdain to accompany him to the\n“bar of Justice in all Charles County”\nor elsewhere. And 1 also wan tit known,\nthat in addition to the salient facts in\nvolved in this C\\V A controversy, there\nare professional improprietors charge\nable to the gentleman’s apparent lack of\nconscientious reactions, from which\nmany people in Charles County have\nbecome victims of necessity, myself in\neluded, for which he must give an ac\ncounting, before I will agree to accept\nhim on equal terms in the adjudication\nof any important issue arising between\nus. The Editor in diacates in the last\nparagraph of hia article that I may have\naccess to the columns of his paper for\nfurthei discussion. But I remember\nthat after the 1930 election when I offer\ned criticism of his paper’s political in\nconsistencies, he was not so generous.\nI therefore, have since had to look else\nwhere for expression of my views.\nVery truly yours,\nF.

If there are\nany members of your Board now re\nceiving compensation tor work they\nare doing for the C. W. A., it is ex\ntremely important that they resign\nimmediately as members of the Board.\nWashington has also ruled that no\npublic official receiving compensation\ncan be on any payroll of the C. W A.\nWill you please see that these rulings\nare enforced at once.\nI want to take this opportunity of\nexpressing to you, and through you\nto the members of your Board, my\nunbounded admiration and respect for\nthe conduct of the C.

She has her\nown plans for the future, however,\nwhich she refuses to divulge to her\nsisters, prominent figures In New York\nsociety.\nCHAPTER ll.—The historic Lovely\nestate.

At the moment she was\nengaged.\nIf Laura was nervous, Smif at the\nback of the establishment was hardly\nless so. Plainly the ttig of war with\nher family could be postponed no\nlonger.\nThe upshot of much meditation was\nthat she Used Madame Georgette’s pri\nvate elevator to summon that kindly\nwoman\nYoung Republican League\nDANCE\nOle Fireside\nT.

In another T flrd I care n\nsurprising lot,” she said succinctly.\n“This is why I wanted to speak to you,\nMadame. There’s just a chance that\neven yet she hns no Idea who Madame\nSaitou Is and has come to consult her\nin good faith, nut if Laura has come\nsnooping—und that Is what I suspect\n—I mean to punish her for it. Why\ndidn’t she ask me what I was, doing,\nstraight out. man to man?"\nShe did not add that on\' the few oc\ncasions when she had seer. Laura or\nLucy of late they had taken every op\nportunity to stress the pleasures and\nadvantages of life in South America,\nand that their obvious desire to he rid\nof her had wounded her deeply. Their\naffection for her was so hidden by\ntheir selfishness that she had begun\nto doubt Its existence.\n"And what do you want of me. Miss\nLovely?" Madame Georgette asked.\n“I’m ready to help you, you know\nthat."\n"I want you to lend me Mademoiselle\nIvonne for a few minutes. I propose\nto make sure of Mrs. Hammersley’a\nfee before she sees me.”\nSmlf showed her white teeth in a\nhighly malicious grin and Madame\nGeorgette ejaculated “God save us!”\nadding: "You wouldn\'t be fakin\'\nmoney of * your own sister. Miss Love\nly?”\n“If she has come here to spy on me.\nI would,” Smif declared. “She de\nserves to be punished. Moreover, in\nany case, to make her appreciate that\nthis Is a serious business she must\nbe made to pay serious money for a\nsight of me. And of course she won\'t\npay a penny if she knows who Madame\nSaitou is. So I’ll find out that much\nbefore I see her."\n“You certainly are a wise one!" „\nMadame Georgette’s admiration was\nunaffected. “Rut I’d bPtter send yon\nJalna. She\'s new since Mrs. Har\nmersley bought anything ofT me. so\nthere’ll be no risk that she’ll recognize\nher.”\nA few minutes later Laura’s solitude\nwas broken in upon hy the silent en\ntrance of a sedate black-robed figure,\nnotebook in hand.\n"Good morning, Madame." the girl\nsaid. "The name is Mrs. James Hnm\ntnersley?" Her air was businesslike.\n"Yes," Laura confirmed this ungru- \'\nciously. Since she had foolishly given\nher name, she saw no help for it.\nThe girl made an entry on a blank\npage. “And the address?”\nThat too was surrendered reluctant\nly because It was useless to attempt\nto hide It.\n"This is a first consultation. I be\nlieve?" \'\n“Yes.” (Another entry.)\n“The fee is one hundred dollars—ln\nadvance,” the self-possessed young\nwoman looked at her expectantly.\n“I never carry such an amount of\nmoney with me!” Laura exclaimed.\n"Naturally not." Jalna returned,\n"your check will he entirely satisfac\ntory. Mrs. Hammersley. I can supply\nyou with a blank check—"\nOne hundred dollars for nothing!\nThe thought was preposterous.

Ijiurn thought. Plainly that was\nthe idea. This was one of SmlTs\ngigantic bluffs. She counted on\nLaura\'s refusal and would chortle with\njoy at ridding herself of her.\n“I was just wondering if I had one\nof my own checks with me," taura\nsaid deliberately. "You can lend me\na pen. I suppose? I prefer a stub."\n“Saitou, Incorporated,” she was\nprompted, as she filled out the check\nand handed It to the waiting girl.\n"And now I hope I will not be de\nlayed long," she suggested. “I am not\naccustomed to waiting."\nJalna was pleased with her new role.\nPeople with the inflections Mrs. Ham\nmersley employed always rubbed her\nthe wrong way.\n“No longer than is necessary.\nMadame,” she said. “I assure you It\nIs a concession on Madame Saltou’s\npart to receive you at all without an\nappointment." She bowed herself out.\nand again Laura was left to her own\ndevices. Time passed slowly until But\ntons at last appeared once more.\n"Madame Saitou will see you now\nIf you will come this way,” he said,\nand led her past the angles of the cor\nridor into the lounge at the rear.\nThe room was modernistic, the walls\nsharply patterned In black, red and\ngold: the floor black, highly polished:\nthe hangings of the little stage red\nvelvet, a tone softer yet as vivid as\ngeranium.
