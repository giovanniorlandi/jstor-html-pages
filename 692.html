The teachers present seqjned\na unit upon the importance of\ni industrial education.\nProf. Crockett\'s paper and the\ndiscussion upon it urged among\nother things that teachers remain\niu a locality long enough to get\nthe confidence of all concerned,\nthen use their influence Lto better\ngeneral condition, especially to\nincrease the attendance and to ex\ntend the sessions hv menoe of\nself help.\nPresident Wallace\'s address\nwas an able appeal to teachers to\nprepare themselves better along\nall lines for more efficient seruce.\nfie also expressed an unwillingness\nto stand for reelection. It was\n} expressed as the sense of the body (\n5 that the address be printed. 1\nAmong the prominent persons \'\n) present were President Miller of 1\nthe State college, Principal At- f\n\' kins of the Slater institute at 1\nWiuHtone-Salem, N.

The address\ni gave increased hope to all hear1\ning it.\n1 JUXTAPOSITION OK THE RACE.\nSupt. McMahan delivered a\nfriendly yet frank address. He\nadmits that an element still doubts\nthe advisability of educating the\nnegroes, but thinks sentiment in t\nfavor of their education is grow- i\ning. He notices that negroes get ] I\nthe best treatment where whites c\nare-best educated, and adyises re- j *\ncognition of the present political I\nand social condition with reliance |\nupon the inseparabilitycf the fate\nof the whites and blacks tose-\'i\nI\'\ncure fair treatment of the latter 1\nby the former. He believes rap- ^\nid moral development of negro (\npupils will do much good, ospec- (\niaJy toward converting those\nwhites who now may be opposed j\nto their education. This address j\nwill do much good. Mr. McMa- j\nhan seems to bo one of those (\nstrong and good mon who would\ndo right and trust the future to\nadjust difficulties.\nThe following were elected\nofficors: J. E.

Binning- *^(\nham is full of life stories that\nare knawn to a few Knd to\'d by 11\nmany, to visitors, as hearsay.\nFive years ago there catno to u\nthe city a man who had been a "\nfarmer and country merchant in u\na neighboring State. Ho brought\n; ki\na few hundred dollars with him *\nand lost it trying to keep a store\nin a suburb. Ho got siek and 01\nwas cared fcr by some people\nwho knew him, and 011 rcedvdry\nhad not a dollar nor a relative in e<\nthe State. He was GO years old, ^\'\n1 ct\nand one foot was disabled. He\nhad before him visions of the\npoor house, or a wjdk back to his 111\nold home. He thought tno mat\'ll\nter of tiis future was plain down\ngrade to a poor relation\'s grave.\nJust at the juncture a man\nwhom ho hud known in the pust ^\ninvited him to suend a wnnlr wiil?\n1 " he\nhin) in the country. lie went (|\nand the pure air ami rest put j\nhope in his heart and he propos ^\ned to caro for the cattle and the ,\nIV\nfowls on the place for his hoard, ^\nand the oiler was accepted. He\nworked a*. I that winter on these\nCfi\nterms. At night the old man,\nwhose name may ho called John\n7 tn\nJones, plaited some door mats of ^\nshucks for the house and a large\nal\none for his own :ooni which had }U\nno carpet. He could not read by\nlamplight and continued to plait\nmats of shucks and grass, and i<*\nfound that ho could sell them\nreadily 111 the city. Whep the\nspring work begun Jones had |u\n$45 in small money, saved from 1,1\nhis mat sales. He resolved to try w\nfor himself again and rented some ,u\nland near his friend and stocked a\nit with fowls and hogs. Ho con- at\ntinned to feed liis friend\'s stock !l*\nM\nfor his hoard and worked a small\ncrop of l is own, of vegetables ?\nand potntoos. He paid his rent \'\nand had $115 when winter hegun J I\nand felt rich. He bought forty j (\nacics of land I wont v acres of it\ntit\nalready cleared and w. rn out,\nfor $200.

He made a little ?]\nmoney with his fowls ami bogs,\nhis door mats and baskets, plaited\nof shucks and grass. The baskets\nwere so thick that eggs could\nbe kept in them in the winter\nwithout freezing. He bought ci\nO u\nsome lumber and helped a "saw J\nand hatchet carpenter" to build iL\nhim a one-room cabin on his land,\nwhich cost him $28. With a littie\nmore than $50 in cash he moved\nto his new house, using a shelf 1J\nfor a bed, and with $<! worth of H\nfurniture ami cooking utensils, he """I\nwent to work for himself, full of\nhope and energy. *J\n? rj ^l>.\nHe had no reasonable sueeess, A!\nbut he had food f< r the wintor j\nami nearly $200 on the first of 1)1\nJ \'??!\n/ \\ 4 I ??\'\nweiuner. >\\ nen Ins note for hi* tia\nland fell duo lie, paid t>oth notes, , jlt\nmade his room comfortable willi * r\nol\nfurniture and utensils, and went iln\nto woik hs usual on his basket ^ \'\nand mats and bought a cow and Y\n.
