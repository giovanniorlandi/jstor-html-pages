The purpose\nof the meeting was to acquaint King\nFerdinand with the trend of public\nsentiment.\nGeneral Averesou, former minis\nter of war, will bn commander in\nchief of the Rumanian army.

Wood, (\'lilted\nPress staff correspondent, on a ro\ncent visit to Rucharest.\nRumania\'s entrance into the war\nplace* n thoroughly drilled and\nequipped army of nearly 600,000\nmen alongside tho rllfes.\nAh to the actual fighting value\nof the army haa boon praised by\nknown an It has never been put to\nthe teat. During the two recent\nHa I knit want Rumania, of all th*\nllalkan states, alone kept out of the\nwar.\nTho organisation and equipment\nof the army has been appraised by\nmany military experts. In Rumania\nmilitary service la obligatory on all\nuble bodied men between the ages of\n21 and 46. This gives the country\n60,000 now soldier* every year and\nenables Rumania, out of a popula\ntion of seven million, to muster an\narmy of over a half million men.\nDuring the first seven year* of their\nmilitary service the men belong to\nthe active army. Then they pass to\nthe reserves where they serve twelve\nyears, and finally pass to tho mili\ntia where they serve until they aro\n46. The militia is supposed to bo\nliable for service only to maintain\ninternal order and to protect rail\nways In case of strikes.\nThis organization gives Rumania\na total of 260.000 rirst line men\nand about 4 00,000 reserves. The\nregular standing urmy consists of\n6.000 officers. 100 military students,\n60.000 troops, 26,000 horses, COO\ncannon und 200 machine guns. Fart\nof this army is now mobilised near\nthe hungurlun frontier.\nRumania’s chief reason for enter\ning the war is the hope of annex\ning to her present territory two Aus\ntrian provinces, Transylvania and\nriokowlna. Inhabited largely by Ru\nmanians. While all the Balkan\nmate.) are interested In obtaining\nland on the Balkan peninsula, Ru\nmania\'s aspirations lie nearer home.\nStill another factor la the fact that\nt tin Rumanian people are chiefly of\nLatin origin, and racial pride Is one\nof their strong characteristics.\nThis world probably will never be\nso busy that you can\'t start an ar\ngument in a few minutes.\nWAHIUNG mvx PEOPIJK.\nIn joining with the allies\nKing Ferdinand will make war\non his own people.\nTho Itumanian kiuK in a\nmember of a royal Prussian\nhouse, being tho son of Prince\nLeopold of Hoheuxollern-Ztg\nmuringen.

Beanpre Is Itetold Following Ar\nrest of Man Believed to\nBe Beaupre.\nThe announcement made Friday\nof Ollie Beaupro’s arrest at Los An\n£®les, California, was good news to\nthousands of readers who have kept\nup with the celebrated case. Al\nthough the murder, with which he\ni» charged, occurred in Dallas the\nre-arrest of Beaupre is due entirely\nto the efforts of local officers. If\nthe suspect, proves to be Beaupre,\nit will be a feather in some local\nofficer\'s cap. For months both the\nsheriff’s department and Constable\nHamm have been working on\nthe case and both were hot on the\n- I\ntrail. Constable Hamm received first\ninformation concerning tlie arrest\nand of course Is claiming Beaupre\nas his prisoner. He is on his wav\nto Bos Angeles now with requisition\npapers authorizing him to bring\nBeaupre back here.\nThe man arrested at Bos Angeles\nhas entered denial that he is Beau\npre and will no doubt make a fight\nto prove his identity, but the infor\nmation upon which he was arrest\ned seems to be very authentic and\nlocal officers believe they have\nBeaupre safely behind bars again.\nBeaupre has been absent for two\nor more years. He failed to appear\nwhen his case was called for trial\nin Waxahachie, to which place a\nchange of venue had been secured,\nand his bond of $10,000 was ordered\nforfeited.\nJ. AV. Ennison of Dallas, who, in\ncompany with George W. Louder\nmilk and Ed Goodman, also of that\ncity, are touring California, sawr\nBeaupre on the streets there a few\ndays ago and Ennison caused his ar\nrest.\nSensational Case.\nThe trial of Ollie Beaupre was\namong the most sensational in the\nhistory or the Dallas courts.\nMrs. Beaupre was found dying at\nher home, Travis and Water streets,\nby her husband, who at that time\nTHE NEW FORDS\nWill Be Here in a Fe\\y Days.\nSee the Demonstration Car at Our\nGarage\nIT’S A BEAUTY\nPLACE YOUR ORDERS NOW\nfor Early Delivery\nHie new prices prevail on the new car.\nW. B. Jackson Motor Car Co.\n(Incorporated)\nwas conducting a pool hall there.\nWhen Beaupre returned to his\nhome he said he found his wife un\nconscious on the bed. Bloody foot\nprints led into the kitchen, a:ul there\na bloody hammer was found.\nBeaupre ran screaming from the\nhouse and neighbors hurried to his\nassistance. Efforts were made to\nobtain a statement from the dying\nwoman, but she pushed her hus\nband away when he pleaded with\nher to tell who struck her.\nMrs. Beaupre was taken to a san\nitarium, where she lingered two\ndays, but site did not regain con\nsciousness. Her husband was pros\ntrated. He collapsed at the sanita\nrium and for several days was un\nder the care of a physician.\nSuspect Husband.\nAfter a second search of the\nhome was made a derby hat was\nfound which was said to have be\nlonged to Beaupre. it w*s found\nbaik of the kitchen stove and the\nlocation of the hat and footprints\nfound on it caused the officers to\ndirect their attention to Beaupre.\nAbout five days after Mrs Beau\npre died Beaupre was arrested and\na formal charge of murder was filed\nagainst him. He collapsed again,\nand it was several days before a\npreliminary trial could be held. Af\nter the examining trial he was held\nunder a $2,000 bond by Justice of\nthe Peace Quentin D. Corley.\nOfficers later discovered that\nBeaupre had been keeping company\nwith a young lady. They also learn\ned from the mother of Mrs. Beau\npro that Beaupre and his wife had\nhad many quarrels preceding the\ntragedy and those facts, connected\nwith other circumstantial evidence,\nresulted in a grand jury indictment\nbeing returned.\nOne Mistrial.\nAt the first trial, w hich lasted for\nmore than two weeks, the jury failed\nto agree, although the jurors were\nheld for several days. At this trial\nthere were about fifty witnesses and\na plea was set, up by the defense\nthat Mrs. Beaupre was murdered by\nrobbers. Neighbors testified that on\nthe night Mrs. Beaupre was murder\ned two attempts were made by\nburglars to enter their homes.\nOne circumstariee which aided the\nstate was that there was a hard\nrainstorm that night. Officers\nmade a careful sw.rcli. but were uu\niiiblo to find any trai ns exrept those\n1 euteriug the horn-* from the front\nand which were admitted to have\nbeen made by Heaupre when he re\nturned home.\nAlex Self, a neighbor, was one of\nt.ho state’s Important witnesses ns to\nthe question of the time that elapsed\nbetween the time Beuupre got off\nthe street car and the time he ran\nfrom his home screaming for help,\nwhich was the one big issue In the\ncase. S< lf said he rode the same car\nhome with Heaupre, hut got off one\nblock further north. He said lie\nhad been In his home several min\nutes when lie heard Beaupre scream.\nHeaupre said lie only remained in\nills home long enough to see that\nhis wife way dying and that lie then\nran nut and called for help.\n(iiven Twenty-Five Years.\nAfter the Dallas jury failed to\nagree tho attorneys for Heaupre\nELDERLY WOMEN\nSAFEGUARDED\nTell Other* How They Were\nCarried Safely Through\nChange of Life.\nDurand, Wis.—“1 am the mother of\n[ fourteen children and I owe my life to\nLydia E. 1‘inkham a\nVegetable Com\npound.

The\nhigher court later reversed the case\nand sent It hack for trial. The case\nwas set again and the witnesses\nwere summoned, hut Beaupre could\nnot be found. The case then was set\noff the docket pending Heaupre\'a\narrest.\nSince that time It has been report\ned on several occasions that Beau\npre had gone to France and was\nfighting with the French army.

Whenever i visit the capi\ntal of a province, I am expected to\ncall upon the governor. Ho soon re\nturns the call and corners with me\nabout many vital matters. The vast\nI Importance of our work in China\nlies in tire fact that the leaders\ntrust Christian missionaries, and\ncome to them for help in the solu\ntion of present, government prob\nlems.”\n“Do you look for an unusual re\nvival in China?"\n“There never was so much inter\nest in the Christian religion as now.\nIn Hinghwa we are compelled to\nhold three meetings a day in a\nbuiiding which bolds 800 people,\nand to refuse anyone the privilege\nof attending more than one of these\nmeetings.
