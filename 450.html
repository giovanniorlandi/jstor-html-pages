When one bootlegger is arrest\ned the other bootleggers see to it\nthat the right sort of witnesses are\nfound and they have their friends\naround where they will be almost\ncertain to be supoaenaed on tly\njury which will try him. This makes\nit easy for the bootlegger on trial to\nbeat his case.\nFor years the established price of\nwhisky bought from a bootlegger in\nthe Indian Territory was $2.00 per\nquart. In case liquor was unusually\nscarce or if a bootlegger happened\nto get hold of a few bottles of really j\ngood whisky he boosted the price to\n$2.50 and $3.00 per quart. But\nwhen the state dispensary was open\ned and the price established at $1.60\nper quart, the old time customers of\nthe bootleggers commenced to roar\nabout the price they had to pay. It\nmade business bad for the bootlegger\nbecause if his customers were not\nsatisfied they could send away and\nhave the liquor shipped in themselves\njust as easily as not. The bootlegger\nthrives on the appetite of those who\nhave an Immediate thirst and are\nwilling to p*y $2.00 per quart for\nliquor when they want it and do not\nwant to take time to send for it.\nSince the Bootleggers Union has\ncut the price of liquor, J. A. Devin\nne has issued a statement concern\ning the liquor business. He says that\nthe brand of liquor that is sold by\nthe dispensary is a high grade whis\nky and is examined and tested be\nfore it is turned over to the agents\ntor sale. On the other hand he says\nthat the liquor that is being sold by\nbootleggers and labeled Sunnybrook,\nis not the same grade of liquor and\nis in fact a very vile drink. This is\ntrue, in most instances, the bootleg\ngers "dope" the liquor they sell.\nThey dilute it and add some kind of\ndope that produces almost the same\neffect as alcohol. This enables them\nto make a big profit on what they\nsell even at the reduced price of $1.60\nper quart.\nMr. Devinne gets ten per cent of\nthe sales he makes, and he says he\nlacks a long way of getting rich at\nit. The dispensary at Muskogee sells\nvery little liquor and less beer.\nJ. Gd Smith of near Mountain\nPeak, was in the city this week and\ns"id that he thinks it best for the\nfarmers to top their cottMi after\nAugust 11. He says he has experi\nmented along this line and finds that\nthe yield was much better than in\nfields adjoining that had not been\ntopped.\ni "Paradise"«the Good Flour ♦\n» ♦\n♦ We have just received a car of that fine Missouri J\n♦ Flour—Paradise.

LANHAM DIES\nHT WEATHERFORD\nA Former Chief Executive o!\nTexas Passed Away Wed\nnesday Night.\nFUNERAL FRIDAY HT 11 A. M.\nServices oi Distinguished Dead Cover\nWide Held of Endeavor (or the\nState and Nation—-Death\nWas Peaceful.\nWeatherford, Texas. July 30.——\nFollowing a remarkable rally, which\nso impressed the members of his\nfamily that they expressed hopes for\nhis recovery, former Gov. S. W. T.\nLanham weakened last night and\npeacefully passed to the other\nworld at 11:25 o\'clock. The Rev. Dr.\nM. K. Little, pastor of the Methodist\nEpiscopal \'Church. South, will hold\nthe services, which will take place\nat the Lanham family home hire\nFriday morning at 1 1 o\'clock.\nPresent when Gev. Lanham died\nwere his children, with the excep\ntion of Frank Lanham, who was en\nroute to this city from Fort Worth.\nA lifelong friend to the late gover\nnor, Alex Rawlins, was also present.\nYesterday morning Gov. Lanham\nrallied. Evidences of what was hop\ned would be a recovery, so that his\nlife would be spared at kast for sev\neral years to come, were noticed in\nhis requests for nourishment. A little\nlater in the morning the governor\nasked for his spectacles, put them\non and directed that the morning\nnewspaper be brought to him. Dur\ning the day he talked pleasantly\nwith various members of his family.\nIt was not until some time after\nsunset that he showed any symptoms\nof sinking. Growing weaker about 10\no\'clock, Gov. Lanham seemed to re\nalize that his end was a matter of a\nfew hours. Calmly he gave directions\nthat his sons. Dr. H. M. Lanham of\nWaco, Edwin Lanham of Weather\nford and Fritz Lanham, and his\ndaughter, Mrs. Ed Connor of Dallas,\nwho were at home, remain at his\nbedside, saying that the end of his\nearthly career was near.\nThe governor\'s mind was perfect\nly collected and he remai»etl· con\nscious to the last. The end was\npeaceful. He did not suffer great\npain and died with a smile on his\nlips. During his last illness, which\nfollowed the shock attendani upon\nthe death of Mrs. Lanham, Gov. Lan\nI ham lost greatly in weight. His face\nj was grown much thinner and his\nι frame rather emaciated,- but with\nj wonderful vitality for a man of his\nι years, his mind was clear and his\nj wits keen to the \' last hour of his\nι eventful life.\nIn the death of Gov. Lanham, the\ntrio of tiring ex-governors of the\nstate of Texas Is broken. There are\nnow but two living men who were\nformerly chief executives of the\netate—-Qharles A. Culberson, now\nUnited States senator, and Hon. Jo\nseph D. Sayers.\nS. W. T. Lanham was born on his\nfather\'s farm in Spartanburg Dis\ntrict, S. C., July 4, 1846. As a boy\nhe was very fond of reading; often\nwhen sent into the field to work he\nwould be found curled up under a\ntree buried in some good book. At\nthe age of 14 he knew by memory\nPollock\'s "Course of Time." When\nhe was 15 he had his first and only\ngreat teacher. He never tired of pay\ning tribute to the influence and In\nspiration of this man, under whose\ntutelage he learned as much Latin,\nGreek and English in one year as\nmost boys learn in four. While still\na boy he entered the Confederate\narmy and did gallant service till the\nend of the war. Returning home he\nmarried, and in 1866 started over\nland with his pretty young bride to\nTexas. His property consisted of\ntwo mules, a wagon and $200. The\ntrip took three months, but the\nyoung couple were never once dis\ncouraged. After looking over the\ncountry, Mr. Lanham cbo3e Weath\nerford as a permanent home. He\ntaught school for a time, assisted by\nhis wife. Indeed, Gov. Lanham has\noften said that hi* wife contributed\ngreatly to hU education.\nGov. Lanham was admitted to the\nliar at Weatherford In 1X69. and\nwas soon thereafter made district at\ntorney He was elected to congress\nin November. 1882. and was re-elect\ned four times. He then devoted him\nself to the practice of lpw for four\nyears, but was again made congress\nman in November, 1896, and contin\nued to serve in that position until\ninaugurated as governor in January,\n1903 He was re-elected in 1904 to\nthe chief magistracy of the state and\nserved in that position until January,\n190·7, when he retired to his home\nat Weatherford\n<;.\\s 1\'ii\'K thi\'gs το ham;.\nTwo California Murderers (io to the\nScaffold Friday.\nSan Francisco.

The sen\ntence of death, passed over eighteen\nmonths ago, has been affirmed by\nthe supreme court and it is unlikely\nthat there will be any interference\nwith tomorrow\'s double hanging.\nBoth of the gaspipe assassins, al\nthough the most ruthless thugs that\never terrorized a city, have now be\ncome prematurely aged and broken.\nSlemsen has prepared a statement in\nwhich he asserts that he was wrong\nfully accused by Dabner to shield a\nbrother, and that Blschoff, the state\nwitness against him at the trial, was\nguilty of many perjuries.\nCHARGED WITH HORSE THEFT\nYoung Man W anted in Dallas County\nArrested in Waxahachie.\nA young man known here as John\nWilson, but who says his name is\nJack Williams, Was arrested in Wax\nahachie Thursday morning by Sher\niff Forbes 011 an alleged charge of\nhorse theft. He was placed in the\ncounty jail to be held pending in\nstructions from the sheriff of Dallas,\nwhere the offense is said to have\nbeen committed. Wilson or Wil\niams is accused of stealing a gray\nmare from a man named Pringle at\nLancaster last spring. The animal\nwas brought to Waxahachie the day\nfollowing the theft and kept in a\nwagon yard here several hours. As\nsoon as Sheriff Forbes was apprised\nof the theft by the officers at Lan\ncaster he made a round of the wagon\nyards anS, learned at one of these\nplaces that a young man riding an\nanimal that answered the description\nof the one stolen had been gone only\na short while. All efforts of Sheriff\nForbes to obtain tracé of the young\nman after he left the wagon yard\nproved fruitless. Thursday morning\nWilson returned to Waxahachie and\nwhile eating breakfast at a local res\ntaurant be was placed under arrest.\nSheriff Ledbetter of Dallas has been\nnotified of the arrest and an officer\nis expected here this afternoon to\ntake the prisoner to Dallas.\nRead the Advertisement*.\nFine\nCigars\nï\nIf you want to smoke\n• real good Cigar,\ntry one of ours. . . .\nThere is quality\nabout them that will\ninduce you to buy\nanother\nIT DRUG SI\nORLY THE BEST\nft MOB STORMS\nPENSftCOLA JAIL\nTwo Men Are Shot to Death\nand Score ol Others Ser\niously Wounded.\nFINALLY LYNCH A NEGRO\nFlorida Sheritl and Deputies Delend\nI heir Prisoner Until Overpowered\nby Sheer Force ol Numbers.\nHanged on Plaza.\nPensacola, Fla.. July UO.—Two\nmen dead and a score wounded,\nsome probably fatally, is the record\nof an attempt last night by a mob\nto storm the county jail and take\nout the negro. Leander Shaw, who\nyesterday assaulted Mrs. Lillian Da\nvis near here.\nThe mob numbered probably 1,\n000 persons and gathered early, but\nthere was no apparent indication\nthat the crowd, which completely\nsurrounded the jail, contemplated\nmaking a rush until nearly two\nhours later.\nThe first indication was when a\nrailroad iron was brought into play\nby about a dozen men upon the iron\ngate of the jail yard. At the same\nmoment the entire mob seemed to\ncatch the spirit and with yells and\ncurses dashed for the jail entrance.\nSome climbed oçr the tall iron fence,\nwhile others hammered upon the\n1 gate.\nThe sheriff with half a dozen depu\n1 ties stood in windows upstairs with\ndrawn revolvers and riot rifles.\nThe sheriff pleaded with the mob,\nI at the same time telling them he\nI would defend the prisoner at the\nI cost of every life present.\nI His words had no effect, and the\nI moment the first blow was struck on\nthe gate a volley of shots flashed\nfrom the upper windows of the jail.\nThis was answered by the crowd,\nwhich poured volley after volley into\nthe jail, wounding two deputies. The\nmob was momentarily driven back\nwith many wounded and one dead as\na result of the deadly aim of the\n[sheriff and his deputies,\nj At midnight the mob, which had\nin the meantime Veen reinforced by\nmany residents of the surrounding\ncountry, made another attack upon\nthe jail.\nThe sheriff and officers were over\npowered by some of the men who had\ncrept over the rear wall and covered\nthem with rifles and revolvers. Oth\ners broke down the cell door and\ntook Shaw out.\nThe negro was carried to the cen\nter of the plaza and hanged to an\nelectric light pole, after which fully\n500 shots were fired Into his dang\nling body.\nIn this latter fight H. C. Kellujit,\n<a street car conductor, was killed,\nj while two deputies and four or five\nj of the mob were wounded.\nENTERTAINMENT AT LIBRARY\nSuggested That α Program Be Ar\nrangrd fur August 17.\nIt has been suggested that in or\nder to give the citizens of Waxaha\nchie and Ellis county an opportunitj\nto show their appreciation of the\nSims Library a special program be\narranged for the night of August\nIT.

And as for\nTexas, well, we have suffered much\nand borne it patiently,· but there is a\nlimit.\nThe Cleburne Enterprise makes\nthis timely observation: "Practicing\ngetting married—sounds queer,\ndon\'t it? And yet It is an every day\nperformance. After the happy day is\nset and approaching, the clergyman,\nbridesmaids, best man, groomsmen,\nushers and the one-who-gh es-away\nthe-bride are carefully selected. All\nthese people and perhaps the choir\nand organist go to the church where\nthey rehearse and rehearse, getting\ndown to a fine point every detail of\nthe elaborate function. At this prac\ntice ceremony or rehearsal of the\nwedding, nothing of the formal cere\nmony is lacking except the words of\nthe ceremony, and the bridal attire.\nIt seems a bit queer when you come\nto think of it all, yet nowadays polite\nsociety demands Just this gort of pro\ncedure for a swell wedding."\nTHK CONVICT PROBLEM.\nJust at tills time Georgia is wrest- j\nling with the convict problem, and\nhas developed and disclosed about \'\nas revolting a case of official mis-,\nmanagement, abuse, brutality and j\ncorruption as was ever bred by that!\nfamed mother of iniquities, the con\nvict lease system.\nThe same trouble has confronted |\nGeorgia before, and, considering the\nfacts then developed and the condi\ntions known to have existed, it is a\nwonder that a great state like Geor\ngia, the public service of which has\nbeen in most other respects cleau\nand praiseworthy, had not purged\nand cleansed her record in prison\nmanagement.\nIt would serve no useful purpose\nto relate any of the revolting details\nrevealed by the evidence, but it is\nsufficient to say that they beggar\nlanguage and are difficult, to believe.\nThey reek with not only brutality,\nbut murder outright, and the iniqui\nties of the Siberian mines can no\nlonger be held up as a standard of\nbarbarity to prisoners. In this age,\nwhen the world is growing better,\nand the spirit of altruism is more\ndominant tiian ever before, it is\nmanifest incongruity in social condi\ntions that no progress—or so little—\nhas been made in the matter of deal\ning with convicted criminals.\nn,very siaie, in some lorm or ano\nther, and at some time, has had the\nsame outbreak of graft and inhum\nanity and scandal. Texas has had\nmost virulent attacks, and, despite\nthe system of management organized\nand enforced by the late Major T. J.\nGoree when he was made superin\ntendent of prisons in 1877, which put\nTexas to the front in prison manage\nment, complaints, more or less well\nfounded, arise even now at intervals.\nThere is, it seems, inborn in some\nchildren an uncontrollable desire to\nwound and torture helpless dumb\nanimals and birds, an innate deprav\nity which finds expression in tortur\ning the helpless; and It seems that\nsomething of the same evil and in\njurious penchant and disposition is\naroused in the minds of many men\nIn whose hands and subject to whose\nunrestrained control prisoners are\nplaced. Tnere have been in connec\ntion with prisoners more injustice,\ncruelty and brutality than in any\nother department of government.\nThe lease system is a great and al\nmost inexcusable evil and should be\nabated. It is true, the problem of\nwhat to do with prisoners is a per\nplexing one. Any competition with\nfree labor naturally and reasonably\nraises a protest. To let convicts sit\nday after day in absolute idleness, as\nwas done a few years ago in New\nYork, is most horrible punishment,\nand yet many convicts are unfit for\nany labor except out of doors on\nfa rms.\nWhat Georgia needs first is to\nhang or put in the penitentiary a lot\nof lessees and guards, and the same\nneed often exists where there are\nprisons.\nThere should be special statutes\nproviding especially severe punish\nment for any unlawful violence to\nward or abuse of prisoners, and\nmost especially should the law of\nevidence be so framed that in cases\nof trials for abuse of convicts the con\nvict should be a competent witness.\nA most rigid system of inspection\nand supervision should be provided\nand maintained, and be unswerving\nly enforced. Such conditions as are\ndaily being revealed in Georgia are\na blot and reproach upon the fair\nname of a great state, and an injury\nwhich can not be measured in dol\nlars.\nIf Georgia will hang a few lessees\nand convict guards she will both do\njustice and set a wholesome example\nwhich will be felt beyond her lim\nits.\nSays the Denlson Herald: "The\nmachine has received a shaking up\nthat has made the teeth of some of\nthe occupants fairly rattle. Machine\nrule has been growing more and\nmore unpopular in this country and\nit is only a question of time when\nthe people in their might will rise up\nand do away with it for a time at\nleast." The fight of the people\nagainst the machine will continue.\nWILL, THE VICTOR REIGN*?\nThe board of directors, at the con\nclusion of the investigation at the A.\n! & M College, fully exonerated Presi\ndent Harrington and re-elected him\npresident of the institution for ano\nther year.\nThe finding of the board was not\na surprise. So far as the exoneration\nof President Harrington was concern\ned. Farm and Ranch unhesitatingly\n\' says that, under the charges filed\nand the evidence introduced the ver\njdict was perfectly right. The charges\nmade were not sustained by the evi\ndence.\nAt the same time, the position of\nPresident Harrington relative to the\nfuture control of the college ia\nchanged not one iota. He lost entire\nly the control of the student body\nduring tbe last session of the col·\nloge, and, no matter what his quali\nfications as an educator or as an ex\necutive officer, for him to expect to\nregain the ground he has loHt would I\nbe absolutely hopeless. After the j\nevents, disgraceful to the college as\nthey were, which marked the closing\nmonths of the last session at the A.\n& M.. parents of students who have\nnot completed their courses would\nhardly require them to return to the\ncollege next fall without a change\nin the management of the institution,\nand, if they did, the session would\nbe oppned with knives drawn, figur\natively, between the head of the in\nstitution and the student body—a\ncondition that is at least not condu\ncive to good academic work.\nThat other boys might take the\nplaces of those whose courses are\nnot yet complete is quite true, but.\nsuch boys would come with practi\ncally the same feeling of antagonism\nas those who were shut out. The fact\nthat President Harrington failed to\nsuppress a student insurrection when\nit should have been suppressed pre\ncluded any farther usefulness on his\npart in the management of the A. &\nM.\nOn the other hand. President Har\nrington\'s skirts are now clear so far\nas specific charges of misconduct are\nconcerned. He can retire from the\ncollege with the truthful claim that\nhe has been fully and completely ex\nonerated by the board. Has he suffi\ncient regard for the institution and\nmanliness to voluntary resign? Is he\nwilling to give place to a man who\ncan start in unhampered to control\nthe students and make such a suc\ncess as the present board of the col\nlege can not, under any circumstan\nces, hope to do?\nIf he shows such evidence of man\nhood It would by no means be amiss\nfor the members of the board to fol\nlow his example.—Farm and Ranch.\nNEW VOK FASHION LETTER.\nBy Catherine Mann-I\'ay/,\\nt.\nNew York, July 30.—Never before\nhave cotton textures been worn to bo\ngreat an extent.

Many\nof these are woolen with border ef\nfects of which may have particular\ni mention the eoliennes and tussahs.\nI worked in a self-color, the contrast\nbeing in the weave rather than the\nprinting. Hand embroidered borders\ndone in soutache or silk are to be\nfound among the veilings.\nIn the tunic designs the under\nskirt and bodice harmonize with a\nbraiding design while the overskirt\nis plain.\nA pretty dress of cotton voile was\nof fine stripes in lavender and white,\nwith ribbons in a deeper shade of\nlavender for belt and sleeve trim\nming. The Empire skirt came well\nup below the bust and topped with a\nshaped girdle of wide ribbons. Tbe\nfront panel was outlined with white\npearl buttons and cross-wise folds\nof the material decorated the side\nportions of the skirt and formed the\nJapanese bands. The front and back\nof the bodice was cut with a U yoke\nand apparently was a continuation of\nthe skirt panel. The guimpe and the\nundersleevee were of tucked white\ntulle. Gloves, shoes and parasol were\nin white, and a white straw hat trim\nmed with a band of fllet lace and a\nmass of lavender flowers and green\nfoliage was In harmony with the rest\nof the costume. A short coatee of\nblack taffeta was sometimee worn\nover this costume.\nKivuiiuu tuuot uc iu auc υ ι iuc ucw\ncotton foulards. Two varltlee are\nprominent, one suggesting surah and\na second a highly lustrous satin. The\ndesigns are many, stripes being es\npecially popular just now; these\nstripes are obtained in many ways;\nstripes alternating with a stripe of\nfine dots on a white ground alter\nnating with a stripe of tiny white\ndots on a colored ground, stripes\nformed by a fine hair line diagonal\nof white and color bars with plain\nstripes of color.\nA foulard gown either In the silk\nor cotton variety is a most serviceable\naddition to any wardrobe, especially\nwhen chosen In a medium color. The\ncolor designs most frequently noted\nare white In combination with Danish\nblue, brown and white, white and\nblack, and green and white and\nbrown and violet. All the favorite\ndesigns of discs, dots, and ashes are\nalso to be found in plenty.\nA material called voile chlnchin\nette, a crepe-llke weave of two col\nors, is very fashionable. So is voile\nfrançaise, which is almost as thin\nas a muslin.\nFor the summer girl there are two\ndistinctly new types of blouses, the\nhammock and piaxza blouse which\nare made from some very sheer ma\nterial such as net or Met lace, both\nof which are very inexpensive and\nlaunder well, while they look almost |\nas well as the rflore expensive mater-,\nlals of a finer but. similar material, j\nFor a really cool dress both in j\nweight and looks, there are some ι\nwhite and lavender striped lawns— !\nand by the way violet blouses are ■\nmuch liked at the present writing. A |\nshirt waist suit in these cool colors 1\ntrimmed with panels of Valencien- ;\nnes laee bands would be a welcome j\naddition to any summer outfit.\nAnd, it is said, If a teaspoonful of j\nturpentine is put into the first water, ;\nthat any violet colored goods is wash j\ned in, the goods will not spot or !\nfade out in those disagreeable patch- i\nes so trying to the owner of a pretty\nwaist.\nAll varieties of the Jumper waist\nare seen daily. The salient feature\nof this well-liked mode should be the\nexact harmony between the front and j\nback. If there is a front panel to the \\\nskirt a panel effect is sought for in j\nthe back; and the back of the bodice |\nis the counterpart of the front bodice;\nand. apart from the wearer, it is ι\nhard to say which is back and which ,\nisfront. Again the jumper suit de- j\npends upon the guimpe for its dressy j\nappearance, for as the yoke is low\nthe collar and front and back of the 1\nunderblouse or guimpe are fully ex-j\nposed to view. The sleeves are beau\ntifully trimmed and they are by no\nmeans the least important part of\nthe costume.\nThere are many washable silks\nshown this summer and many of the\nnew piazza waists are trimmed with\nthem in bands, pipings and folds. One :\nwaist was developed from washable\nnet, having a yoke of lace braid upon\nwhich were applied bands of silk. In 1\nall cases these waists have under\nlinings of this silk ih self-color or\nsome faint contrasting shade\nColonizing the Cranks.\nAs yet there has been no colony\nof cranks, although Dr. Dent, sup\nerintendent of the Manhattan Luna- 1\ntic asylum, has strongly recommend\ned to the New York authorities the\nadvantages of establishing oil some\nIsland or seaside place a colony of\nthose persons—a large and increas\ning class—who are not sufficiently\ndemented to be in an asylum, yet are\ntoo mentally unsound to take care\nof themselves, or to be easily mana\nged at home. They are thus a source\nof anxiety to their relatives and of\nten they are an annoyance and a\nmenace to the community. Many of\nthem possess abilities—even streaks\nof genius—but are unable to direct\nthese to any practical end.\nif they were guided and restrained\nby firm, kind, sympathetic methods,\nthey might work usefully in various\nways and make a happy, self-sup\nporting colony. Watchfulness would\nbe necessary; as the crank is an un\ncertain quantity. He may be per\nfectly harmless up to the time of\nsome mysterious internal crisis,\nwhen his illusions may take a malig\nnant turn; or until his emotions are\nexcitingly wrought upon.\nThere is a difference between the\ncrank and the half-wit. The crank\nhas a warped brain, proceeding from\ndisease, accidental injury or hered- 1\nity. ThA. half-wit\'s mental growth;\nwas arrested by malformation, be- 1\nginning at birth. Some of these half\ndeveloped beings are repuleive: oth-\'\ners are most lovable, possessing a ·\nchild-Ill^ dignity and repose.\nModern surgery has effected some j\nremarkable cures in half-witted chil-|\ndren; the lifting or trepanning of ai\npart of the skull giving room for the\nbrain to grow. Patient teaching has\nalso, In many instances, brought\nabout great mental improvement. I\nWhat a pity It is that every state in\nthe union hasn\'t a home and school\nfor its feeble-minded children!

S. CAMPBELL & CO. ;\nMUR BORDSMAYBEGOMEISSUE\nAlleged that Secretary Cortelyou Has\nPostponed Redemption oi Bonds.\nWashington, July 30.—A new ls\n■ue mar ariae 1b the coming presi\ndential campaign, owing to the al\nleged decision of Secretary Cortel\nyou to postpone the redemption of\nthe 3 par cent Spanish war bonds\nwhen they fall due day after tomor\nrow. It Is stated on good authority\nthat Mr. Cortelyou, for various reas\nons, haa decided to allow the bonds\nto run on for an indefinite period be\nfore redeeming them or refunding\nthem into 2 per cent bonds. It is cer\ntain that such a course, if Anally de\ncided upon, will result In a good\ndeal of criticism and that the oppon\nents of the administration will not\noverlook the opportunity for making\npolitical capital out of it. It is alleg\ned on behalf of Secretary Cortelyou\nthat the bonds cannot be refunded to\ngood advantage at this time, and that\nhe does not consider It advisable to\npurchaae them for the Rlnking fund.\nThere are about $65,000,000 of\nthe bonds outstanding, a total of\nnearly $200,000,000 having been is\nsued during the Spanish war to run \'\nten years, with, the privilege of be- |\ning extended another ten years. Most\nof the bonds are in the hands of the .\ntreasurer of the United States in\ntru -t aa security for the circulation !\nof national banks. To continue thçm\nafter August 1 will necessitate the\npayment of ^loae to $2,000,000 a j\n»ear in lntereai. Converted Into 2 par\ncent bond·, which the secretary has\nauthority to do, the annual interest\nchart· would be $1,300,000. Paid j\noff altogether the govern meat would\nbe saved further interact.\nIt is regarded as practically a cer\ntainty that the democratic campaign\nmanagement, probably Mr. Bryan\nhimself, will criticise the failure to\npay off the bonds, If they should be\nleft outstanding after August 1.\nSecretary Cortelyou\'s reasons for\ndelaying their purchase are said Ό\nbe numerous, but the democratic\ncriticism will be based upon the plain\nallegation that the government hw\nplenty of cash on hand to pay them\noff, thus retiring the bonded Indebt\nedness, and that they are continued\nfor the benefit of the national banks.\nThe working balance of the treas\nury at this time la $64,000,000. That\nis, the vaults contain that mnch\nmoney, not in use, except to meet\ndally expenditures, which are at\npresent largely in excess of revenues.\nThe $64,000,000 will meet deficits\nfor many weeks to come, as well as\nmhny months. But the treasury has\na large available cash balance in na\ntional bank depositories. These in\nstitutions now hold $138,777,462 of\ngovernment money, besides another\n$11,000,000 as balances for disburs\ning officers. The banks could be call\ned upon without serious detriment at\nthis time, it is pointed out, for suffi\ncient money to pay off the 3 per\ncents if refunding was not consider\ned.\nEvery day the treasurer is mak\ning advances out of its cash to the\nPanama canal, and It is simply a\nquestion of waiting for a propituous\noccasion before putting more Pana\nma bonds upon the market to meet\nthe balance due and to provide funds\nfor continuing Work.\nReception orders filled for {fee\ncream, plain.

The ad\nvance was decided on after much\nopi>osition on the part of certain\nrailroad executives, who maintained\nthat an advance of rates at the pre\nsent time was impolitic, but this op\nposition was finally won over by the\nargument that in order to meet the\ni various increased expenses in rates\n\' was absolutely necessary.\nWe Have It.\nAny kind of feed you want, also\nwill be glad to furnish you your\nwood and coal for winter.

The government is\nsued an order recently for the remov\nal of this idol to the, national mus\neum of the City of Mexico. Wher.\nthe men who were sent to the town\nto take the idol out of the church\nmade known to the parishioners the\nobject of their visit the populace\nmade violent protest. The order has\nnot yet been obeyed and it Is consid\nered probable that the Idol will be\npermitted to remain where it is.\nThis goddess of plenty is an enor\nmous monolith, which represents\nsome of the finest work of the peo\nple of which the Aztecs were the ru\nling tribe. It represents a gigantic\nwoman, whose garments are richly\ncarved in representation of ears of\ncorn arid wheat, and pleasantly con\ntrasts both in features and dress\nwith the Aztec goddess of serpents\nnow in the museum. The discovery of\nthe idol was made only recently by\nLeopold Batres, the government ar\nchaeologist, who happened to visit\nthe little parish church. It was upon\nhis suggestion that It was ordered\nremoved to the nation\'s collection\nThe church In which this idol was\nfound Is one of the oldest in Mexi\nco, but it heretofore has received\nvery little attention from the ar\nchaeologist. It has a handsome inter\nior and contains a number of paint-1\nings which are said to be the work\nof old masters.\nPhone H. A.

First, the\nmachine must carry two persons hav\ning a combined weight of 360 pounds\nand sufficient fuel for a flight of 125\nmiles. It must be constructed so as\nto ue assembled and ready for oper\nation In one hour, or taken apart\nand packed In an army wagon in the\nsame period of time. It must have a\nspeed of forty miles an hour in still\nair, and if it makes less than thirty\nsix miles an hour it will be rejected.\nThe speed is to be determined by\ntaking an average of the time over a\nmeasured course of more than five\nmiles, against and with the wind.\nIt must make an endurance flight\nof at least one hour, continuously in\nthe air, and must return to the start\ning point and land without injury.\nDuring the flight it must be steered\nin all directions and at all times be\nunder perfect control and equili\nbrium. It must be so designed as to\nascend in any country which may be\nencountered in field service. It\nshould be sufficiently simple in con\nstruction and operation to permit an\nintelligent man to become proficient\nin its use in a reasonable time, and\nmust be provided with some device\nof safe descent in case of accident to\nthe propelling machinery. Three\ntrials will be allowed for speed and\nthree for endurance, both tests to be\ncompleted within thirty days from\nthe date of delivery.\nThe Wrights were given 200 days\nin which to complete their machine\nand Herring 185 days, therefore the\nHerring machin*1 will have its trial\nfirst, The Wrights are to receive\n$25,000 for their machine if it\nmakes forty miles an hour, with 10\nper cent increase for every mile over\nthat and like deduction for every\nmile under forty down to thirty-six,\nat which point it will be rejected.\nHerring is to receive $20,000 for his\nflyer, with the same sliding scale.—\nVan Norden Magazine.']</pre>
