        <pre>['PUBLISHED THKEE\nBRYAN REPLIES\nTo The Criticisms of Congress\nman Clark of Florida\nUNABLE TO APPEAR\nSo He Writes a Letter i.> the House\nof Representatives of Florida,\nWhich Had Invited Him to Ad\nderss It?He Discusses Several\nMatters of Importance.\n"When a representative cannot con\nscientiously do what bis constituents\nconscientiously desire him to do, he\nought to be conscientious enough to\nresign and let them select a repre\nsentative in harmony with them."\nThis, in brief, is William J. Bryan\'s\nattitude on the pending tariff bill,\npresented in a letter addressed to the\nFlorida general assembly and read\nin the house Tuesday night. Mr.\nBryan found it impossible to accept\nthe invitation extended by the leg\nislature to come to Tallahassee and\naddress them in answer to Mr.\nClark\'s criticisms of the Nebraskan\nand certain doctrines contained in\nthe Denver platform.\nThe reading of his letter was greet\ned with prolonged applause.\n"There are two schools of\nthought," says Mr. Bryan, \'in re\ngard to the duty of the official:\nThe aristocratic theory is that people\nelect representatives (to think for\nthem: the Democratic theory is, on\nthe contrary, that people think for\nthemselves, and elect representatives\n?to \'give legal expression to their\nthoughts and to voice their senti\nments.\n"I am suspicious of the official\nwhose conscience is dormant during\nthe campaign and only active when\nhe wants to find an excuse for do\ning what his constituents do not\nwant done."\nTurning his attention from Mr.\nClark.. Mr. Bryan addresses himself\nto certain proposed legislation as\nfollows:\n"There is a reform which should\nrecfive the support of all, whether\nthpv believe in prohibition :pr not.\nThit= reform is this, that the Federal\ngovernment should discontinue the\nissuance of licenses for sale of liquor\nIn territory where leeal authorities\ndecide to prohibit its sale."\nTouching on trusts and monopo\nlies. Mr. Bryan declares that "the\ntrust question is on with which the\nState must deal. Under our dual\nform of government the monopolis\ntic corporations have been playing\np*eh government aeainst the other.\nThev contend that they are engaged\nin Interstate commercje When the\nState attempts to legislate, and are\nstaunch advocates of States rights\nwhenever the federal government at\ntemnts to restrain.\n"The regulation of corporations\nis nsuallv the most difficult subject\nwith which a lesislator has to deal,\nbecause of* the influence brought to\nbear unon the legislator by the cor\nporations.\n"State government should em\nploy their powers for the protec\ntion of the public against the evils\nof private monopc.y and T believe\nf. nt the best as well as the simplest\nsolution will be found in legislation\nfixing the percentage of control\nwhich a porforotion shall pxprt over\nthe product in which he dpals."\nAs to thp need of more adequate\nbanking laws he says: "The banks\nare not now sufficiently secure, as is\nevidpncpd by the fact that the\nnational government, the State gov\nemments, counties and the cities all\nrequire special security. A large\npart of the banks prestige is due to\nthe faet that it does business under\na charter granted by the govern\nment and is so regulated and insult\ned a? to give the depositors coni\ndpnc* in its solvency, and it is only\nfair."\nIn conclusion Mr. Bryan said:\n"Tho initiative and referendum a"1\nbeing adonis! by State aft^r State\nand they perfect our repres?ntati\\*fl\nform of government by bringing\nthe government nearer to the peo\nple."\nA WEIRD STORY.\nTrained Pack of Wild Animals Eat\nUp a Child.\nA weird tale of the lonely north\nland is brought to civilization by\nFred Allingham and two companions,\nJames and .Mack J. Curtln, of Saska\ntoon. Sask., who have bren spending\nthe winter around Moose Lake,\nI northwest of the Pas, according to\n?the Indianapolis News.\njL A traper secured a number of l\n?ume timber wolves which he train\nHi for driving, as they developed re-1\nKarkahle endurance and sneed. On\n^one occasion the trap\' r was away\non a long journey. After finishing\nup a hard day\'s run in which the1\nanimals had not received any food,\nas is the way of treating dog teams\nwhile traveling, as th^ driver and\nthe team approached the shanty that\nwas their home, his little three-year\nold child ran out to meet them. Tho\nfamished animals jumped on her in\na flash and she was devoured be\nfore the father could raise a hand.\nSeizing a sharp axe from his\n"boat," the trapper went at the wild\nreatures and never stopped until\ne had killed the entire lot.\nTIMES A WEEK.\nTHE POTASH TAX\nCONTROVERSY BETWEEN LEVER\nAND THE DAILY MAIL\nAbout the Matter?Mr. Lever Does\nNot Claim That He Killed the\nProj>osed Tax Alone.\nThe Anderson Mail printed the\nfollowing in its editorial column of j\nApril 20:\nThe glory that Representative Le\nver has gotten out of the removal\nby the house ways and means com\nmittee of the duty on potash salts\nis amusing to those who know some\nthing of the facts.\nMr. Lever is a member of the agri\ncultural committee, and he has\ndoubtless availed himself of whatever\nadvantage this may have offired to\nurge that fertilizer ingredients be\nplaced on the free list, but it may\nbe positively stated that he was not\nthe only congressman from South\nCarolina who urged the committee\nnot to tax potash salts, and it is\nvery doubtful if he was.the first\nto do so.\nIt is also very doubtful if the\ntax on the raw material will be worth\na cent to the farmer. It is certain\nj that the manufacturers and not the\nfarmers poured in telegrams to the\nI congressman to have thie tax re\nmoved. We doubt if Mr. Lever can\nshow a single telegram or letter\nfrom a single farmer in regard to\nit.\nMr. Lever, with the Democratic\nparty, is voting for free products\nI of leather on the ground that free\ni hides with a duty on the products\nof hides, would help only the manu\nfacturers. This may not be good\nreasoning, but it is good Democratic\ndoctrine1, and if it is applicable to\nthe shoe manufacturers it is also\napplicable to the fertilizer manu\nlacturers.\nThe practice with some national\nstatesmen seems to be to grab every\nthing in sight. While their right to\nfoist themselves upon the people is\nnot questioned, some little regard\nshould be shown their associates who\nmay be affected thereby. The friends\nof these public servants should not\ntake press comments touching their\nfavorites too seriously. For instance,\nthis from the Newberry Herald and\nNews:\n\'"Congressman Lever won the fight\nfor the farmers, not only of South\nCarolina, but wherever commercial\nfertilizer is used. By the way, who\ncan tell who the other members of\ncongress from South Carolina are?\nWe are proud of Lever. He is a lit\ntle Newberry college boy."\nPerhaps other congressmen need\nto inject more energy into their press\nagents, or to do a little more press\nagenting themselves.\nBut the claim made for Mr. Lever\nis amusing the sensible people.\n( Fancy Messrs. Payne. Dalzell and all\nthe other Republican bosses, fall\ning into line when Mr. Lever cracks\nhis whip. Fancy their having heard\nthat Lever was opposed to taxing\npotash salts, and then breathlessly\nwaiting to find out if the report was\ntrue. Congressmen from the North,\nWest. East and South, equally in\nterested, were asked to stand aside\nuntil Mr. Lever had his way. Lever\nspoke, and then the objectionable\ntax was removed. Hurrah! Also\nBanzai!\nThe Herald and News may claim\nl^as much as it pleases for Mr. Lever,\nbut it should not attempt to dispar\nage other congressmen equally as\nearnest and equally as faithful in\nthe discharge of duty. The Herald\nand News\' fling comes with mighty\npoor grace from a city which has\nrecently been given a SSO.000 public\nbuilding solely through the work of\none other member of congress. The\nNewberry paper displays rank in\ngratitude, to say the least of it.\nLetter From Mr. Lever.\nEditor Daily Mail: My attention\nhas been called to your edifr> "ia:,\n"Mr. Lever and the \'lax on Potash "\nin your issue of April 20, in which\n! you ridicule the idea of my being ab!?1\nI to accomplish the removal of the\nduty on potash salts and basic slag.\nYour editorial is an answer to one\nby the Newberry Herald and News,\nwhich gives me all of the credit for\nthis tight.

Hyslop, of the\nAmerican Society of Psych fical Re\nsearch, who, With Dr. Isaac M. Funk,\nhas revealed many of the mysteries\nof spiritualism, relates, in the forth\ncoming Journal of Psychical Re\nsearch, the remarkable case of Mrs.\nSusan Dellinger, of York , Pa.\nProf. Hyslop has spent many years\nin endeavoring to discover any actual\nfacts which would prove the exist\nance of a spirit world. In the case\nof Mrs. Dellinger he believes a ma\nterial fact has been found.\nWilliam E. Hooper and his broth\ner, Curvin, were shot and killed near\na little church ya/d at York. Three\nyoung men were arrested and charg\ned with the murder.\nMrs. Dellinger, according to Prof.\nHyslop, dreamed two nights after\nthe crime that she had seen one of\nthe alleged slayers, Henry Snydor,\npick up a revolver and throw it over\nthe cemetery fence, where it fell by\nthe side of a grave, on which she\nread in her dream the epitaph of\n"Curtis Site."\nOn relating her dream the follow\ning day to her son, Mrs. Dellinger de\nscribed minutely where the revolver\nwas seen by her in her vision, and\nsaid that it could be observed from\noutside the fence. The son went t3\nthe ceme.eiy and found the weapon\ntxactly wiore she had ie-cribed.\nSydnor Subsequently confessed to\nlh--? chief of police, accordi ig to Prof\nHyslop, and said that lie had dis\nposed of the revolver in exactly the\nmanner described by Mrs. Dellinger\nin her vision.\nSHERIFF KILLS PRISONER.\nIn a Life and Death Straggle in a\nDark Cell.\nEly Holmes, a desperate negro\nprisoner in the Lee county jail at\nLeesburg, Ga., was shot to death\nWednesday afternoon in a hand-to\nhand fight with Deputy Sheriff H.\nD. Logan, in a dark cell in the jail,\na fight in which the loser could not\nleave the cell alive. Roth men rea\nlized this, according to Deputy Lo\ngan, and when his chance .came he\nkilled the negro. He had entered\nHolme\'s cell, and the negro attacked\nhim, it was stated, with a stool,\nbeating the officer unmercifully be\nfore the latter could draw his pis\ntol. Then a fight began for its pos\nsession, which ended when Deputy\nLogan fired, and the negro dropped\nto the cell floor dead. The officer\nwas exonerated.\nTo Establish Airship Lines.\nAt a meeting of the Wurtemburg\nAerial Navy League, it became\nknown that the Zeppelin Airship\nCompany would establish a regular\nline of airships from Luecerne or\nFriedrichshafen to North Germany,\nvia Frankfort-on-the-Main, to open\nfor traffice next year.\nto, but I feel that in justice to my\ncolleagues from South Carolina that\nI should do so. I wish to say in\nbehalf of all of them, your represen\ntatives and all, that they are always\ndiligent in all things that affect the\ninterests of South Carolina, and they\nwere no less diligent in helping to\nremove this tax on commercial fer\ntilizers, which would have amount\ned to a burden of more than a quar\nter of a million to the farmers of\nthe State. You ridicule the idea\nthat Messrs. Payne and Dalzil. and\nother Republican bosses should fall\nin line when I crack my whip. I\nfreely admit that personally I have\nno influence with either Mr. Payne\nor Mr. Dalzell. I am sure, however,\nthat I have many influential Repub\nlican friends who, in this fight, did\nnot hesitate to let Messrs. Payne\nand Dalzell and oth> r members of\nthe ways and means committee know ,\nthat, they were interested in seeing!\nI potash salts and basic slag put on\n[the free list and that this interest\nwas largely due to their friendship\nI for me. 1 mention among those,\nI Messrs.

MA\nWERE IN PRISON\nSeaman Had Been Mourned For\nDead\nTHEIR SHIP SEIZED\nAn Escaped Prisoner From Ven\nezuela Tells a Strange Story About\nthe Missing Captain and Crew of\nthe Whaling Ship Carrie Knowles\nThought to Have Been Lost.\nIt may be that Capt. Collin Steph\nenson and the crew of the Ameri\ncan whaling ship Carrie D. Knowles,\nlong since thought to have been lost\nat sea, are still in a Venezuelan\nprison.\nAn American seaman, who gives\nthe name of Payne, an escaped pris\noner from Venezuela, has made his\nway to Kingston, where he laid be\nfore the authorities an astounding\nstory of the seizure of the Carrie D.\nKnowles at a Venezuelan port, where\nshe arrived five years ago in dis\ntress, and the incarceration by the\nVenezuelans of the captain and his\nmen.\nThe authorities at Kingston have\ntaken steps looking to a speedy and\nthorough investigation of the case.\nOn January 27, 1904, the Carrie\nD. Knowles sailed from Province\nton, Mass.. on a whaling voyage. Her\ncaptain was Collin Stephenson, and\nher first mate, H. A. Martin. In\naddtion she carried a crew of about\na dozen. Payne asserts positively\nthat all are at the present time con\nfined in a Venezuelan prison.\nThe vessel was supposed to have\nbeen lost in a West Indian storm,\nwith all hands. Some of the men\nbelonging in St. Vincent, and after\nall hope was given up of their return,\ntheir relatives put on mourning and\nthe local insurance company eventu\nally paid the claims against it, on\nthe assumption that the sailors were\ndead. The story Payne told to the\npolice authorities caused great ex\ncitement.\nPayne declared that the whaler\nhad been disabled in a storm off the\nVenezuelan coast and had made\nport in distress. This was five years\nago. She war. at once seized and\nthe captain and crew were made pris\noners and thrown into jail. The\ndetails of Payne\'s escape from pris\non are not known, as the police have\nhim in charge.\nLITTLE GIRL KILLED.\nDelivery Wagon Crushes Infant to\nDeath.\nA special to The News and Couri?r\nfrom Greenville says Eugenia Gil\nreath, the sixteen-months-old daugh\nter of Mr. and Mrs. Jim Gilreath.\nof Greers, was run over a few after\nnoons ago by a delivery wagon and\nher skull fractured, death resulting\nat once. A young white man named\nBub Glenn, was driving the delivery\nwagon, and while looking over an\norder book, ran over the liile girl,\nwho was in the street. He had not\nknown of the accident until he ha 1\ndriven a cnu;;!e of blocks. It is\nsaid he is almost frantic with grief.\nThe little girl had slipped out of tho\nhouse and into the street, where sUh\nwas killed.\nSTRANGE ACCIDENT.\nSaek of Guuno Exploded and Injur\ned a Man.\nThursday afternoon on the planta\ntion of .Mr. 3. L. Moore, between\nWaterloo and Harris Springs, a very\nunusual accident occurred. A ten\nyear-old negro boy while trying to\nuntie a sack of acid had his left\nhand torn and lacerated by a ter\nrible explosion. No one seems to\nknow the cause of the accident. The\nshock and jar were It by others\nat work in the field and resembled\ndynamite. The boy suffered pro\nfound shock, sand and dirt being\nblown in his face and ey. s.

The\n? commissioners proposed that the\ntown of St. Matthews issue bonds\nto the amount of $20,000 and that\nthe county issue bonds to the amount\nof $30,000, making $50,000 in all.\nThis proposition has brought on a\ncontroversy between Mr. J. S. Wan\nnamaker, who favors the proposition,\nand Dr. T. H. Dreher, who is op\nposed to asking the country people\nto vote more than $20.000, which\nhe thinks is suiilcient. The contro\nversy is getting quite warm, and is\nbringing out some ante-election facts\nthat are interesting. Here is Dr.\nj Dreher\'s last letter, which we take\nfrom the Calhoun Advance of Thurs\nday:\nEditors Calhoun Advance:\nI am sorry that my friend, Mr\nWannamaker, and I cannot, agree up\non the court house and jail propo\nsition, but that is not material. We\nare both private citizens and expres\nsing our opinion in the newspapers.\nHe, nor the new county commission,\nnor I, have any more legal right to\nadvise the legislative delegation,\nper se. than any other responsible\ncitizen, as to waht the county should\nbe bonded for. To exploit the $30,\n000 bond issue in the paper and\nthen suggest it be not oppose i\n"through the press" Is asking rather\ntoo much.\nA healthy and fair discussion of\npublic issues, bereft of all personality\nand abuse, is the hope of the county.\nThe fact that so few dare to do it.\nis one of the discouraging signs of\nthe times. The truth never hurts a\ngood cause. If wrong, the sooner\nit is corrected the better.\nI have no halter around anybody\'s\nneck. I am appealing only to reason\nand judgment, and want no verdict\nfrom any other tribunal. As a school\ntrustee and town commissioner, T\n"e\'ieve that I am fairly well posted\nupon bond companies and public\nbuildings.\nAs such, T unhesitatingly assert,\nthat $20,000 from the town and a\nlike sum from the county is every\ncent necessary to construct, a suita\nble and highly creditable court\nhouse and jail for Calhoun county.\nMore than that, under existing cir\ncumstances, it is extravagance, pure\nand simple.\nMy figures were not denied, but\njt is claimed that the bonds may be\nfloated at 4 per cent. That is a truly\ncommendable extrication from an\nawkward corner. "What are the\nfacts?\nThe 5 per cent town bonds for St.\nMatthews (which pays a sixth of\n*hc taxes) were patriotically bought\nby the local banks and sold at pnr.\nafter three years, minus the com\nmission fee, which was paid by the\nban1\'?.\nTf my friend will sell the 5 pnr\ncpnt school bonds of district No. 8\nwithin the next sixty or ninety days\nat par, T will, personally, pay him\n? he same commission that his bank\ndid for unloading hers.\nMy heart, soul and body have\nlv^en set upon having a creditable\nschool building for this district.

Here is the\nstory:\nBack in the 30\'s there were in the\nold university at Athens, Ga., two\nyoung men who both became after\nward Presbyterian ministers of more\nthan local renown. One was a quiet\nstudent, who devoted his heart and\nmind to his books and afterward\nbecame, in connection with his minis\nterial work, a professor in old Ers\nkin College at Due West.\nThe other, a young man of rest\nless, energetic, inquiring turn of\nmind, was always trying fo solve\nsome problem, the solution of which\nwould lighten the burdens of the\nworking people. Among his "new\nfangle" machines was one which\nwould do the needlework of the\nfamily in much quicker time than\nmany seamstresses couid accomplish\nit. He was enthusiastic about his\ninvention. It was a crude machine,\nbut it did the work?a simple lock\nstitch mechanism turned by hand and\nmounted on a stand table or what\never was convenient. His -pride in\nhis machine was such that he show\ned it, and discoursed upon it on all\noccasions.\nThere came one winter between\n1830 and 1831, a young man from\nthe North to winter in Georgia. The\ninventive young student, who was\nafterward the Rev. Francis R. Collid\ning, of Georgia, showed his machine\nto his Northern friend after their\nacquaintance. He was struck to see\nits possibilities, and its value and\nupon his return North appropriated\nthe design, mechanism and whole\nmachine to his own use without the\nadvance or consent of his Southern\nfriend, and patented the first sew\ning machine. The young Northern\ner was Elias Howe.\nYoung Goulding was amazed and\nhorror struck at what deprived him\nof his rights, for being a boy of but\nmoderate means he had not yet funds\nto take out letters patent on his ma\nchine.\nThis story was told by the daugh\nter of young Goulding\'s classmate\nabove referred to, the late Rev. Wil\nliam McWhorter.\nIn his teachings in schools and\ncolleges whenever he saw Elias Howe\nmentioned as the inventor of the sew\ning machine, he would always close\nthe book and tell the class the story\nabove given, always ending with the\nstatement: "Now, boys, always re\nmember it was not Elias Howe who\ninvented the sewing machine, but\nthe Rev. Francis R. Goulding, a\nSouth Carolina boy at Athens, Ga.,\nUniversity, whose design was appro\npriated without leave or license by\nElias Howe, who saw it while on a\nvisit to Georgia."\nT\'iis story he urged his daughters,\nwho became teachers, to tell their\nclasses also. That justice might be\ndone to the geinus of Francis R.\nGoulding, a student of Athens Uni\nversity between 1830 and 1835, who\nwas the inventor of and maker of\nthe first sewing machine. William\nMcWhorter and Francis R. Gould\ning graduated at Athens, Ga., in\n1835.\nThe two daughters of the Rev.\nWilliam McWhorter lived near Ab\nbeville and have often heard the\nstory from their father\'s lips, and\nknow that he was a fellow student\nof Mr. Goulding.\nThe Greenville News would like\nto hear from any of the decendants\nof the Rev. Francis R. Goulding. and\nwith them assist In making a some\nwhat tardy atonement to his honor.\nWill Soon Be Gone.\n-.Within ten or fifteen years, ac\ncording to .T. H.

For\nexample, in a recent letter to the\nMilwaukee Journal, a poor woman\nwho is trying to live on less than\n$500 a year, says:\n"My husband gets $11 a week\nfor eleven and a half hours\' work,\nwhere others get $18 for the same\nwork. Now, say rent is $13, coal\n$8. food $20 a month and poor\nfood at that. Count in that with\nfive or six in the family, and where\ndo the doctor, medicine, shoes,\nclothes, insurance on life, insur\nance on furniture, school books,\nand the Lord knows what else,\ncome from? As for a piece of\ncandy or cake, or pie or the\ntheatre, what can you do with $44\na month?"\nThis is not the opinion of a trained\npolitical expert or even of an office\nholding statesman; It is just the bare\nstatement of facts from one who is\ntrying to live in a country where\nevery article of necessity is oppres\nsively taxed in order that overgrown\ngiants may have that protection\nwhich was once thought necessary\nfor struggling infants. And when\nthe talk is over and dene about the\ntariff helping th? workmen it\'s worth\nwhile for the workmen to stop and\nconsider how much of this oratory\nis hased on truth and how much of\nit is mere claptrap used to obscure\nthe real facts and to maintain a\nburdensome and killing tax on the\npoorer classes of a community.\nFor example the poor wear clothes,\nand yet the tariff on wools is 11\ncents a pound, and woolen clothing\nand blankets carry a tax that varies\nfrom 134.97 on the cheapest to 94.32\non the highest grades. We have been\nnourishing and protecting our cot\nton manufacturing industry for near\nly a century: yet the average tax\non cotton today is 49.40. and when\nthe amount of cotton cloth used by\nthe poor is considered the weight\nof this tax stands out in all its se\nverity.\nTh\'ire are 80.000,000 people in the\nUnited States and they all wear\nshoes, but congress and the politic\nians have taken small note of this\nfact from the wearer\'s standpoint,\nfor there has been an increase of 25\nper cent in women\'s shoes alone in\nthe ten years between 1890 and\n1900. The raw material for shoes\nis hides, and W. L. Douglas, the great\nshoe manufacturer, who wss also\nDemocratic governor of Massachu\nsetts a few years ago, is authority\nfdr the statement that $30,000,000\nper annum could be saved the people\nof this country by taking the duty\noff hides, but the duty stays on.\nThe fact that a man is poor does\nnot make him any less desirous of\nliving in a houses yet every stick\nthat goes into his humble dwelling\nis taxed under a lumber tariff. This\nmeans according to the estimate of\nthe labor bureau at Washington\nthat it would cost 41.4 per cent more\nfor material alone to build a house\nin 1309 than it would have cost in\n190S. Nor does the tariff hold its\nhands with what we have enumer\nated. Practically everything that is\nconsumed or worn or used levies\nan oppressive tax on the poor in or\nder that the government may gain\nsome revenue, while favored bene\nficiaries amass stupendous fortums.\nThe tariff is not only unwise; it\nis unjust, and some day the people\nwho are bearing that burden will\nfind it out and then the national\nsovcrnment will reduce its expenses\nand change its source of revenue un\ntil the cost of living is made to\nharmonize more nearly with the in\ncome of the gr^at body of the citi\nzens, ft was just such a letter as\nthe on? we have printed above tha\'\nmade the workingmen of England\nrise sixty y< ars ago and break down\nthe bread monopoly of that country.\nThe workingmen of America also will\nrise some day when they understand\ntne true inwardness of the tartT\nmonopoly in this courtly.\n"Sickening Slush and Twaddle."\nThe Florence Times says: "Con\ngresman Lever is very much injured\nbecause the papers of the State have\npoked fun at him for his hurrah\nover the removal of the duty on pot\nash and the more the matter is en\nquired into the more foolish it turns\non* to be. Lever\'s press agents are\nblamed for it by the Anderson Mail\nnow. winch lets the congressman\ndown easy. As a matter of fact there\nis more sickening slush and twadlde\nworked off through the press cor\nrespondents in Washington than any\nwh re else on earth, and our good\nDemocrats, our South Carolina rep\nresentatives, are right in the push.\nFrom all that we can learn nobody\ndeserves any credit for that potash\nbusiness, the framers of the bill\nfound out themselves as soon as they\nwere shown its pre-?n"e hi the\ned column, that they were taxing\ntin ir friends, the manufacturers, and\nthey feii over each other in their\nhaste to get it reprinted on the other\nside. The boy that stood on the\nburning deck was not a star in the\nflag of glory to the South Carolina\ncongressmen who \'fought, bled and\ndied\' to get that duty removed."\nFrom what we have read in papers\noutside the State we would infer\nthat the fertilizer trusts were the\npotent factors in having the tax on\npotash knocked out \'of the tariff\nbill. Congressman Lever no doubt\nkicked up a big racket about the\ntax. and is honestly of the opinion\nthat he had much to do with its re\nr-juval, but. as a matter of fact it\nwould have been removed if he had\nnever opened his mouth. As soon\nas the trust found out about the tax\nthey got busy, quietly, of course, and\nthe tax was removed, but they did\nnot herald it to the world, as that\nis not their way of doing business.\nIt must have caused them to smile,\nhowever, when they saw the credit\nfor the work they had done given\nto certain congressmen.\nStatement of the Condition of\nTHE PLANTERS\' BANK,\nlocated at Orangeburg, S.

The State put up the girl and\nher parents as witnesses. The de\nfense also0 placed several witnesses\n; on the stand. The verdict was guil\nty, and Davis was sentenced to pay\na fine of $2d a year for twelve years\nIn support of the child. Dr. L. K.\nSturkie represented the defendant.\nJacob Summers, colored, was next\ntried for the murder of his wife,\nMary Summers, on February 24. Dr.\nJ. T. Carter was the . first witness.\nHe only gave his opinion and testi\nmony concerning the medical atten\ntion he rendered Mary Summers be\nfore her death. Eli Summers, the\nfather of the prisoner, and Eugene\nSummers, his half-brother, testified\nto exactly the same thing, which\nshowed conclusively that Summers\nhad killed his wife. In fact, he ad\nmitted that himself, but said he was\nafraid of his wife, knowing she was\na woman who was certain to do what\nshe had promised, and she had prom\nised to kill him. No other reason\ncould be got from him for killing\nher. His father and half-brother\nwas passing the house in two wag\nons, one ahead of the other, when\nMary suddenly ran out and scram\nbled Into the wagon with the old\nman, who she told to drive on and\nnot to stop, as Jake would kill her.\nThen her husband came running up\nwith an axe in his hand. He jump\ned into the wagon and struck Mary\non the head with the axe, knocking\nher out on the ground. He then\njumped out and while she was ly\ning on the ground he hit her again\non the head, as you w$uld a hog.\nThen he put up the axe, got his mule\nand rode off to give himself into\ncustody, which he did. The defense\nput up a number of witnesses in\nttieir effort to show that Jacob Sum\nmers was of unsound mind and not\n"Vf^espipnfjble H?r his actions. The\njury did not leave their seats, for\nthe Solicitor and the attorneys for\nthe defense, Messrs. Wolfe and Ber\nry, agreed on a verdict of murder\nwith a recommendation to mercy.\nThat was all his lawyers tried to do\nfor him anyway?to save his life.\nHe was sentenced to the penitentiary\nof the balance of his natural life.\nWash Richardson had a sealed\nverdict read to him of beinj guilty\nof violating the dispensary law, and\nsentenced to pay $125,or four months\non the public works. Wash had\nbeen tried in his absence, through no\nfault of his. His attorney had ad\njfejsed him to go home, thinking the\ncourt would not reach his case that\nday. but the sudden termination of\nthe Shuler case changed that.\nCharlSe tCreacb plead guilty of\nhousebreaking and larceny, and was\nsentenced to two years.\nPatrick Whaley, colored, was in\ndicted for asault and battery with\nintent to kill one Ned Oliver, also\ncolored. This case wan called\nWednesday, but was continued to\nThursday morning. This reporter\ndid not hear all of the evidence, but\nfrom what he could gather, Whaley\nwas accused of stealing up to the\nhouse about dark where Oliver was\nliving and firing a gun at him at\nclose range, blinding him. The sup\nposition is that Oliver saw WhaJey\nas h? was preparing to fire, but as\nhe can\'t see he can\'t identify him\nnow, and nobody else saw the shoot\ning. The jury returned a verdict\nof not guilty. C. P. Brunson, Esq.,\nrepresented the defendant.\nAnderson Footman plead guilty to\nthe charge of carbreaking and lar\nceny, and was sentenced to nine\nmonths on the public works or in\nthe penitentiary.\nWilliam Summers was tried in his\nabsence for obtaining goods under\nfalse pretenses, and the Judge wrote\nout a sealed sentence for him.\nFriday morning court convened at\nthe usual hour, but owing to the\nabsence of a witness was unable to\nget to work until about 10:30. Then\nW. M. Carter and H. S. Spires were\nput on the docket, charged with the\nmurder of J. A. Reed some time ago\nin a dispute about the boundary of i\nsome land. Messrs. Wolfe & Berry\nand T. M. Raysor represented the de\nfense. There was considerable time\nconsumed in the selection of a jury,\neleven jurors having been selected\nfrom the entire list. Then a new\nvenire had to be drawn in order to\nget the requisito number.\nDr. J. G. Wi\'liams was the first\nwitness for tht* State. His testi\nmony consisted of his medical atten\ntion and a dying statement made to\nhim and others by Mr. j. A. Re.-d.\nThis showed that Mr. Spires and Mr.\nCarter became involved in a dispute\nwith Mr. Reed about donating som<> j\nland for making a new road, and the ,\nlocation of the boundary line was\'\nthe cause of the trouble. We will\ngive our readers the result of this ,\ntrial in our next Issue.\nA Delightful Concert.\nThe concert "fvoti pt tb? Aendemv 1\nof Mnsie on Thursday evening for !\nthe benefit of Moultrie Chapter, D.\nA. R.. was a meet 3o)!ghtful ent^r-j\ntalnment. The singing of Mrs. Cora\nLienn. of \\n\'1r>r?on. was charming.\nShe has a melodious, cb-ar voiee. j\nwhich is under perfect control at all .\ntimes. The cpmr> may be said of\nMrs. Aull, who contributed no \'if*\'"\nto the pleasure of the evening by h r\nsinging and reading. Miss Foster\nreads most entertainingly and charm\ned all who heard her. The only\ncriticism we have to offer is that the\naudience was entirely too small for\nsuch an entertainment.\nMAYOR\'S COURT.\nTimes Were More "Jolly" Than\nSerious Thursday Morning.\nW\'hen Chief Fischer said on Thurs\nday morning, \'\'Court will come to\norder," he wore a pleasant smile,\nfor he had a big catch. Commence\nment Day for the two colored col\nleges in this city had beeu uoserved\nthe day before, and that \'helped\nsome." Several offenders had "blew\nin\' their money for "booze" and oth\ner nonsense, so they had to ^\'dig\nup" some more from friends or\n"money sharks," with which to pay\ntheir fines, for they could not af\nford to take- the days imposed and\nstay away from the farm or their\nregular labor. But they didn\'t think\nof "Home, sweet home" while they\nwere celebrating the day before. The\nlist of sinners follow in the order\nin which they were tried:\nLydia Gallishaw plead guilty to\nbeating a child that had beat\n"her\'n," and she was fined one dol\nlar or two days.\nFrank Tyler plead guilty of being\ndrunk and disorderly, and was fined\ntwo dollars or five days. Tyler had\npromised the Mayor to quit, but upon\nbeing question, he said he guessed\nhe had lied.\nAnother case against Tyler charg\ned him with drunk and disorderly\nand indecent conduct in the store of\nMr. S. J. Dukes on Russell street.\nIt was so proven, and he got fined\nfor three dollars or six days xor\nthat.\nMary Duncan, drunk and disorder\nly and cursing on the streets. Fined\nthree dollars or eight days.\nGeorge Williams was a simple\ndrunk. He said it was his firot tiui3\nbefore the Mayor, so he got two dol\nlars or five days.\nBoyd Baker was charged with dis\norderly conduct in striking a boy.\nBoyd said he only made a feint at\nstriking the boy, but being an old\noffender he got four dollars or ten\ndays, just the same.\nFred Robin had been drunk the\nnight before, but he didn\'t know\nit until next morning. He said he\nhad never been arrested before, and\nhe was no hobo, but was from Vir\nginia and repaired organs, clocks,\nmachines, etc., for a livelihood.\nThat\'s tough pn Virgiriia. When\nthe Mayor started to fine him he\ncommenced with: Robin, I give you\nfive dollars or?" "What\'s that,\nwhat that?" yelled Robin. Then "we\nall laughed." He was given $5 or\n12 days or the privilege of leaving\ntown. He said he would "hike out"\nas soon as he could get his grip.\nClint Kennedy plead guilty to be\ning disorderly, and was fined two dol\nlars or five days.\nFrancis Parier was drunk and dis\norderly, but she didn\'t know how two\nor three little drinks could make any\nbody drunk. She got three dollars or\neight days, and ehe didn\'t know\nwhat had hit her.\nWm. Alken forfeited his bond of\n$2.50 for reckless driving.\nIsaac Smith, drunk and disorderly,\n$2.50 bail forfeited.\nSellers Inabinet, drunk and dis\norderly, $2.50 bail forfeited.\nIsaid Shuler, committing a nui\nsance, $2.50 bail forfeited.\nCharlie Bowman, $2.50 bail for\nfeited.\nThere was only one case Friday\nmorning. A white man plead guilty\nof being drunk and asked the court\nto be lenient with him. He paid one\ndollar fine.\nError in Supervisor\'s Report.\nMr. Editor:\nIn the quarterly report of the\nSupervisor, which was printed in one\nof the last week\'s issue of your paper,\nit appears that Mr. N. N. Hayden,\nJr., was paid two claims for "salary\nand mileage," namely, claim Nos.\n351 for $37.95, and 364 for $24.\nThis is a mistake. Only the last\nmentioned claim, No. 364, was for\n"salary and mileage," the first claim,\nNo. 351, being for peas sold to the\npoor house farm by. Mr. Hayden. I\nwish you would insert this correction\nin your paper in justice to Mr. Hay\nden.\nM. E ZEIGLER,\nClerk of Supervisor.\nMay\'5, 1909.\nViolated Dispensary Law.\nAn arrest warrant was served on\nGovan Palmer, the jporter of the\nEdisto Social Club, for violation of\nthe dispensary law, yesterday. The\nwarrant was sworn out before Mag\nistrate Brunson by Mr. J. H. Claf\nfy. About the latter part of Feb\nruary Palmer was arrested, with Dr.\nBrown, on this snme charge. At that\ntime he was found guilty by the\nMayor\'s Court and sentenced to a\nfine of $50, which was paid. Now\nthe State has taken a hand in the\nmatter and have had Palmer re\narrested. His case will probably be\ntried at the next court of general\nsessions.\nA Very Sad Death.\nThe Bamberg Herald says the six\nyear-old son of Dr. and Mrs. E. C.\nSmith, of Williston. died at the home\nof .Mr. and .Mrs. X. J. Thomas, in\nthe Cope section of Orangeburg\ncounty Thursday of last week.

Brown,\nwho had been arrested and placed\nIn ;\':,:1 last Tuesday upon a warrant\nsworn out by Mr. J. H. Claffy for\nviolation of th" dispensary law, ap\npeared before Magistrate Brunson\nand applied for bail. This was grant\ned in the sum of $200, Messrs. Henry\nAvers and B. C. Hutto signing his\nbond.

C. Johnson, of North,\nS. C, to show cause why he should\nnot be attached for contempt of\ncourt, was discharged under certain\nconditions. The suit was instituted\nby the receivers of the\'Seaboard Air\nLine and in the complaint it was al\nleged that Johnson under claim and\ndelivery proceedings, took a quanti\nty of goods out of the railroad sta\ntion at North, which were being held\nfor the payment of freight, and that\nwhen the case in the Magistrate\'s\ncourt was decided against him, re\nfused to return the goods, or pay\nthe charges or respond to the con\ndition of the bond. The railroad\nbeing in the hands of receivers, it\nis held that the moving of the goods\nfrom the depot was an interference\nwith property in the hands of the\ncourt.\nThe order\'discharging the rule is\nas follows:\n\' \'A rule to show cause having been\nissued by the court that the said E.\nC. Johnson, of North, to show cause\nbefore this court why he should not\nbe attached for contempt of this\ncourt, and it appearing to the court\nthat the said E. C. Johnson acknowl\nedges that he acted hastily and in\nadvisedly in instituting the proceed\nings in the Magistrate\'s courts that\nhe regrets said action, and avows\nthat he intended no disrespect to J\nthe court and had no intention , or\ndesire to interfere with the receiv\ners in the discharge of their duties.\nAnd, said E. C. Johnson, through\nhis attorneys Nelson & Nelson, has\nsignified his willingness to pay the\ncosts in this proceeding and the prop\ner charges for services rendered by\nthe Seaboard Air Line Railway for\nthe transportation: It is ordered\nthat the rule heretofore issued in\ntho above entitled matter be, and\nthe same is hereby dismissed upon\ncondition that said E.

If your house needs anything\nalong this line, right now is the best\ntime to do it. If it doesn\'t, let us\ncongratulate you, and then fix up\nthe surrodundings so that they wiil\nhe in harmoney with the home.\nmany buildings which cannot, for\nvarious reasons, be painted, a good\ncoat of whitewash will answer the\npurpose.. Stables, smoke-houses,\nchicken houses, pig pens, and fences\ncan all be treated to a new white\nsuit much ofrener than they usuallv\nare with griat profit all around.\nThe yard and the garden fences\nand the one about the barnyard,\nshould be carefully looked after, too,\na\'l broken placs fixed stcorely right\nnow, and all the gates put in good\nworking order. There is no use it\nwaiting until the chickens get inio\nthe garden and scratch it up or till\nthe pigs root up the front yard to do\nthese things.\nYou will want, of course, to look\nafter the grass in the yard, and the\nshrubbery and the flower beds, and\nthe shade trees, to clean up all litter\nof any kind, to set out some new\nshrubs and perennials, perhaps, to\nput out some late flowering bulbs;\nto cut out and dead branches of do\nany other pruning that may be need\ned in the shade trees. Let us beg\nyou right here not to whitewash the\ntrunks of your shade tres. That\nis all right in your orchard if you\nwish to kill the oyster shell bark\nlouse; but on a shade tree in the\nyard it is an abomination.\nThen about your well or spring\nor cistern?don\'t deliberately court\nsickness and death by neglecting\nthese. Clean off the soil about your\nwell or spring, and fix it. so that\nthere can by no possibility be any\nsurface drainage into it. Insist that\nno kitchen water or other refuse be\nthrown out near, or where by any\npossibility it can drain Into the\nwell or cistern, and do not allow the\npigs or chickens to run about the\nsource of your water supply. Do\nnot permit any decaying woodwork\nto remain about or over the well or\ncistern, and do not allow any water\nto run into the cistern until the roof\nhas been well washed off.\nAll this may seem a great deal of\ntrouble; but ordinarily it will not\nbe so much as it seems; and, in\nany case, it is cheap) r than to run\nthe risk of typhoid aud other dis\neases.\nThere should have been no dead,\ndry corn stalks or other litter left\non the garden last fall; but if there\nwas, gather it ail up and burn it.\nbefore you do any more garden mak\ning. We do not approve of the burn\ning of vegetable matter as a rule,\nbut this is an extreme case. You\nwill have insects enough without\nproviding special harbors for them.\nBesides you want the garden free\nfrom all obstructions of every kind\nso that you can cultivate it with the\nleast trouble and in the best manner.\nAround the barn, in the stalls, pig\npens, chicken houses, and from the\nbarnyard, you want to get all the\nmanure and other refuse and get\nit on the land. You can well afford\nto delay planting a day or two to\ndo this; for you do not need this\naccumulation about the premises,\nand?unless 3-011 are very much of\nan exception to the general rule of\nfarmers?you do need it on your\ncrops. Any old cornstalks or other\nsuch litter should be taken to the\nfields-, too, unless needed for bed\nI ding.\nj A clean barn with a well kepi\nj yard about it is always attractive,\nj speaking, as it does, of thrift and\nI energy. A clean barn is not an\nempty one, but one that Is till d\nonly with good seed for the stock,\nand not messed up with waste, dirt\nof all kind, and a beterogenous mass\nof old broken and worn-out tools\nI may be kopt so that one can go into\nI i! without looking like he had been\ndragged through a dust heap; and\nCan also be kept free from upleas\nI out and unwholesome odors.\n! So clean up this spring and get\nthincs in shape. .Make the place\n\\nr,u pomehndv lives there, have\nit neat, wholesome and attractive.\nYou can do it: and if will pay in\ndollars and cents, in added satis\nfaction, in renewed ambition and in\ncr ased selfrespect.\nThe Branchviilo Journal says:\n"Bowman had the pleasure of listen\ning !o a liiosl eloquent sermon Sun\nday by Rev.

COWARD.\nChester Veteran Suggests Him for\nState Commander.\nIn. speaking of the meeting of the\nConfederate Veterans at Chester\nin June, Mr. W. H. Edwards, of that\n! place, says it will be necessary at\nj this meeting to elect a commander\nof the South Carolina division. Mr.\nEdwards then says:\n\'^f want to make a nomination\nfor this office of a man who stood\non the firing line during the hwole\nI four years of the bloody conflict, and\nj one who performed gallant and ef\nficient service?Col. Asbury Coward.\nAfter Gen. Jenkins was promoted\nCol. Coward commanded the Fifth\nSouth Carolina Volunteers that form\ned part of Jenkins\' brigade, which\nbrigade was equal to any brigade in\nthe Army of Northern Virginia for\nI discipline and gallant deeds. I think\nit quite likely tint Co\'. Coward is\nthe ranking Confederate officer of\nany South Carolinian now living. I\nwant to sa?v to all my old comrades\nnow living in South. Carolina and\nwho expect to attend the State re\nunion at Chester that we will honor\nourselves by honoring this grand old\nhero. He is very modest and unas\nsuming, and you will never hear him\nparading his war services before the\npublic, but he deserves as much\nhonor for gallant and efficient service\nas any man now living in South Car\nolina. It won\'t be long now until\nall the men of Col. Coward\'s age will\nbe gone from among us, and let us\nhonor them while we have the op\nportunity, not because he was an of\nficer, but because he possessed the\nfitness, the willingness and the cour\nage to he made the leader and com\nmander of his regiment. How many\nof the gray-headed boys will second\nthe nomination?"\nThe Editor of The Times and Dem\nocrat hasn\'t the honor of being a\nveteran, but he most heartily seconds\nthe nomination of Col. Coward, and\nendorses every word Mr. Echvards\nsays about that gallant gentleman.\nThe pen picture drawn of Col. Cow\nard by Mr. Edwards is true to life.\nSouth Carolina sent no braver or\nmore gallant son to the front during\nthe war than Col. Coward, and no\nveteran wears more moderately and\nunassuming the honors he gallantly\nwon while leading the bravest sol\ndiers that ever marched to martial\nmusic than he does. Mr. Fdwards\nis right. The veterans in honoring\nCol. Coward would be honoring them\nselves.\nHAPPILY MARRIED.\nMrs. A. C. Tyler Weds Mr. L.

Then came\nthe welcome announcement, "Come\nin to supper." And, Mr. Editor,\nsuch a supper. You have often\nread and perhaps heard of tables\ngroaning under the load of good\nthings, but on this occasion they\nwere too heavily loaded to groan.\nThey simply had to hear the prodi\nguous and enticing burden without\na murmur. But it was not long be\nfore the expectant guests relieved\nthem of some of their burden and\nmade glad the inner man.
