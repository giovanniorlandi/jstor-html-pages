        <pre>['Introduction\nDuring the 1970s and into the 1980s many people\nbelieved the Himalayan region was experiencing environmental\ndegradation on a major scale. Increasing\npopulation pressure was leading to agricultural expansion\nonto steeper and more marginal land, and massive\ndeforestation was perceived. The views of Eckholm\n(1975) and the predictions of almost total deforestation\nin the hills of Nepal by 1993 (World Bank 1979) added\nweight to this scenario. These ideas have been summarized\nby Ives and Messerli (1989) in the 8 components\nof what has come to be known as the Theory of\nHimalayan Environmental Degradation. The supposed\ncause and effect relationship can be expressed in\ngraphic form (Figure 1). Increased landsliding as a\nresult of land use change, especially deforestation, is a\nmajor component of this scenario and is the basis of\npoints 4 and 5 in the 8-component degradation model.\nThe scenario as outlined appears eminently sensible,\nbut many elements have been challenged, not the least\nby Ives and Messerli (1989). One problem is the\nextreme difficulty in establishing the specific links within\nthe model. Thus, as argued by Thompson and War-\nburton (1988, p 1), a “complex series of interactions\nbetween man and nature in the Himalayan region has\nmany experts from various disciplines speculating about\nthe probable cause of events in the area.”\nIt was for this reason that an interdisciplinary project\nwas undertaken in the Middle Hills of Nepal\nbetween April 1991 and March 1994 to provide accurate\nand reliable field data on environmental processes relevant\nto an evaluation of the future sustainable develop-\nment of soil and water resources (Gardner and Jenkins\n1995). The overall aim of the project was to provide better\nunderstanding of the processes and rates of soil ero-\nsion and the characteristics of water quality and aquatic\nbiology associated with different land use systems and,\ntherefore, land use change. The results of the landslide\ncomponent of the study are reported here, although\nbrief comparisons are made with soil erosion rates.\nStudy area\nThe study area is located in the Likhu Khola watershed,\nto the north of Kathmandu (Figure 2). The area was\nchosen because of its wide range of land use systems,\nrepresentative of those found in the rest of the\nNepalese Middle Hills (Figure 3). Its nearness to Kathmandu\nmeans that the land is under intense pressure,\nwith extensive use of chemical fertilizers and conversion\nof rainfed bari terraces to irrigated khet terraces\nwith triple cropping in some areas. The 4 subcatchments\nchosen were of a suitable size for year-round\nmonitoring and were characterized by different proportions\nof the various land uses, thereby enabling the\ninfluence of land use to be assessed. The existence of\nlarge areas of protected forest also provided good comparisons\nwith other land uses, and there was good aerial\nphotograph cover back to 1967.\nThe Likhu Khola is a tributary of the Trisuli\ndrainage system that has its headwaters in the Langtang\nregion of the High Himalaya. The study was conducted\nwithin 3 south-facing and 1 north-facing subcatchments,\nall of which are less than 5 km2 in area. Altitude\nvaries between 600 and 1800 m, and the lithology is\nlargely composed of gneisses of the Kathmandu Complex.\nThe rocks are weathered to a depth in excess of\n7 m, with the deeper parts dominated by silts and finemedium\nsands. Most of the soils are freely drained and\nhave been mapped by the Soil Survey Division of His\nMajesty’s Government, Nepal, as Cambisols and Luvisols\n(Maskey 1995). On steeper slopes and where there has\nbeen past erosion, soils are essentially Arenosols,\nA great deal has been\nwritten about the relationship\nbetween land-\nsliding and land use\nchange, especially\ndeforestation, in the\nHimalaya. But few\ndetailed quantitative\nstudies have examined\nthis relationship. The\npresent article reports\nthe results of a 3-year study of landsliding in 4 subcatchments\nof the Likhu Khola drainage basin in the Middle\nHills, Nepal. During the years of study (1991–1993), 381\nlandslides were noted, the vast majority of which were\nsmall failures on the risers of irrigated terraces (khetland).\nAlthough significant in terms of labor input, these\nfailures were insignificant with respect to land degradation\nand overall denudation. Most significant were larger\nfailures on abandoned terraces and degraded forest. It\nwas estimated that the average annual soil losses from\nthe main land uses were 0.48 ton/ha for irrigated terraces,\n3.65 ton/ha for rainfed terraces, 1.86 ton/ha for\ngrassland, 0.80 ton/ha for forested land, and\n23.95 ton/ha for forest scrub and abandoned land. The\ncombined average erosion rate was 5.55 ton/ha. Thus,\ndeforestation does not necessarily lead to large soil losses\nfrom landsliding; much depends on how the land is\nmanaged after deforestation.\nKeywords: Landsliding; land use; land degradation;\ndeforestation; Himalaya; Nepal.\nPeer reviewed: June 2001.

Slope angles are generally\nsteep, with usually over 25% of the slopes being steeper\nthan 30° and over 70% steeper than 20°.\nThe natural land cover of the area is subtropical\nwith tropical hardwoods on the lower slopes and mixed\nbroadleaved formations at higher altitudes. But much\nof the forest has been cleared for 3 main types of agricultural\nland: grazing, bari, and khet. Bariland comprises\nrelatively gently outward-sloping rainfed terraces, frequently\nwith a ditch at the back of the terrace to mini-\nmize overland flow and erosion. Khetland represents\nthe system of irrigated terraces usually used for the\ngrowing of rice (Figure 4). It is important to make the\ndistinction between double-irrigated and single-irrigated\nkhetland. Double-irrigated khetland produces 2 rice\ncrops, 1 during the premonsoon period and 1 during\nFIGURE 3 General view of the\nDee subcatchment of the Likhu\nKhola (visible in the foreground),\nwith khet terraces on the lower\nslopes and patches of woodland\nand bari terraces on the higher\nslopes.

Thus, these terraces are subjected\nto continued irrigation for a long period of time. Single-irrigated\nkhetland is subject to natural climatic con-\nditions during the premonsoon period and to artificial\nirrigation during the monsoon season.\nThe remaining areas of forestland are a source of\nfuelwood and fodder and are managed to some degree.\nSome areas have been planted with trees. A proportion\nof the land has been abandoned and taken over by\nshrubs and sal (Shorea robusta) scrub. This is often heavily\ndegraded forestland that has not recovered; some of\nthe abandoned land used to be bari terraces. Some of\nthe grassland also occurs on old, degraded bari terraces.\nThe proportions of land under the various land use and\nland cover types are shown in Table 1.\nThere have been changes in land use over the last\n30 years. Cultivated land has increased markedly at the\nexpense of former grassland areas; there has also been\nextensive conversion of bariland to khetland wherever\nirrigation has been possible. Bariland has expanded a\nbit onto the upper slopes but has also been abandoned\nhigh in the headwaters, close to the drainage divides.\nSome of this abandoned bariland has been forested,\nbut some, as noted earlier, has been allowed to revert to\ngrassland and sometimes to scrub. These changes and\ntrends are broadly similar to those reported in the Land\nResource Mapping Project overview of land use change\nin the Middle Hills of Nepal (LRMP 1986) and to the\nviews expressed by the local farmers.\nMethodology\nThe results presented here are for landslides that\noccurred in the 4 subcatchments in the years 1991,\n1992, and 1993. As far as possible, all slope failures have\nbeen identified and measured. Classification of failure\ntype has been kept as simple as possible. Two broad\ntypes, slumps and debris slides, encompass the majority\nof failures. Slumps are failures, often small, that occur\nas a relatively coherent mass on a gently curved failure\nsurface. The commonest type was the failure of an individual\nagricultural terrace riser, with the material usual-\nly coming to rest on the terrace below. Debris slides\nbreak up on failure, are often quite shallow, and tend to\ntravel further downslope. Such failures moved greater\ndistances and sometimes reached the drainage channels.\nAll dimensions of the failures were measured, but\nthe analysis presented here is in terms of the width of\nthe failure scar and the volume of material involved.\nThe failures have also been classified in terms of their\nconnectivity with the overland flow pathways on the\nslope and the land use. Connectivity has been assessed\nas low, medium, and high. With high-connectivity failures,\nthe material possesses a direct link to the drainage\nsystem and could have an immediate effect on river sediment\nloads. Also, in management terms, remedial\nmeasures would need to be established quickly to prevent\nwidespread erosion and continuing instability. Low\nconnectivity defines situations where none of the failed\nmaterial is removed from the slope system. The failed\nmass is generally reworked into the terrace systems.\nMedium connectivity implies an intermediate situation\nwhere there is no immediate loss of material from the\nslope but where it is possible for overland flow and gullying\nto deliver sediment to river sources in the near\nfuture. Such failures also need immediate remedial\naction.\nFIGURE 4 Rice transplanting on\nkhet terraces low down on the\nvalley side. Remnants of sal\nwoodland in the background, in\nvarious states of degradation.\n(Photo by John Gerrard)\n', 'Research\n51\nRainfall totals for the 3 years of the study were\nslightly below the 1981–1991 average (2558 mm) recorded\nat Kakani, in the southern watershed of the Likhu\nbasin. High-magnitude events were also not exceptional.\nMaximum continuous rainfall (defined as no breaks in\nmonitored rainfall exceeding 30 minutes) from 1992 to\n1993 was 102.4 mm. This magnitude in 1 day has a\nreturn period of approximately 1.7 years, using Kakani\nmaximum 24-hour rainfall data from 1972 to 1986 as a\nbaseline. Therefore, slope failures should reflect relatively\nnormal rather than exceptional conditions.\nResults\nA total of 381 failures were recorded in the 4 subcatchments\nin the years 1991, 1992, and 1993, of which the\nvast majority were small slumps (Table 2). The number\nof debris slides was much lower, but the average size was\nconsiderably greater. The 4 failures in the other category\nwere deep-seated rotational slides. \nMost failures (65.6%) occurred on irrigated khetland,\nfollowed by bariland (9.7%) and grassland\n(6.8%). A number of failures (4.5%) occurred within\nthe confines of old landslides. In many cases these former\nlandslides had not completely recovered before a\nsubsequent, albeit usually smaller, failure occurred.\nFourteen failures (2.6%) were recorded on sal scrub\nand 10 (2.6%) on forested slopes. Failures are sometimes\nassociated with irrigation channels (2.4%), usual-\nly as a result of seepage or lack of management of the\nchannel sides. The main problem with these failures is\nthat, until they are repaired, water escapes downslope\nand may initiate considerable erosion. Usually, however,\nsuch failures are repaired very quickly.\nIn terms of numbers, khetland appears to experience\nparticular problems, but the vast majority of these\nfailures involved a small volume (Table 3). The average\nvolume of failures on khetland was 5.16 m3, and only\n5.6% of the failures were debris slides. The majority of\nthe failures involved only a part of a terrace riser or\nsometimes the complete riser. Very rarely was more\nthan one terrace involved. Of the 290 slumps recorded,\n81% occurred in khetland. Only 16% of the debris\nslides occurred in khetland.\nAlthough failures on bariland were fewer in number,\nthey tended to be larger, with a higher percentage\nof debris slides. The average volume of a failure on\nbariland was 59.34 m3. The average failure size on grassland\nwas 224.42 m3, with 56% being of the debris slide\ntype. The percentage of debris slides on sal scrub was\n86%, with an average volume of 766.67 m3 for all failures.\nAll the failures in old landslides were debris slides\nwith an average volume of 376.6 m3, and 50% of the\nfailures in forests were debris slides with an average volume\nof 128.8 m3 for all failures.\nThe large number of failures on khetland might\nsuggest a possible problem with water management and\nthe labor involved in repairing the failures; but the\nsmall size of failures would mean that khetland contributes\nlittle sediment to the drainage systems and has\nminimal denudation rates from landsliding. This tends\nto be substantiated when the connectivity of the failures\nwith the drainage system is examined (Table 4). A very\nlarge percentage (90.8%) of the failures in khetland\nwere in the low-connectivity group, and only 4.4% were\nassessed as possessing high connectivity. In contrast,\n10.8% on bariland, 21.4% on sal scrub, 24.0% on grassTABLE\n1 Areal proportions of\ndifferent land use types in the 4\nsubcatchments.\nTABLE 3 Number of slope\nfailures on different land use\ntypes classified by volume.\nPercentage of \nLand use Area (ha) total area\nKhet 378.7 30.6\nBari 205.5 16.6\nGrassland 191.1 15.4\nForest 179.8 14.5\nScrub and abandoned 72.5 5.8\nAverage\nLandslide type Numbers (%) Volume (m3) volume (m3)\nSlumps 290 (76.1) 2308.0 7.96\nDebris/rock slides 87 (22.8) 30,101.3 345.99\nOthers 4 (1.1) 384.0 96.0\nTABLE 2 Types, frequency, and\nsize of failures in the 4\nsubcatchments.\nVolume (m3) Khet Bari Grassland Landslide Sal scrub Forest\n0–1.9 149 7 6 0 0 0\n2.0–3.9 49 8 3 1 0 1\n4.0–5.9 15 5 1 0 0 0\n6.0–7.9 9 3 0 0 0 0\n8.0–9.9 5 2 1 1 0 1\n10.0+ 21 12 14 15 14 8\n', 'John Gerrard and Rita Gardner\nMountain Research and Development   Vol 22   No 1   Feb 2002\n52\nland, 29.4% in old landslides, and 50% in forests were\nin the high-connectivity category. This would imply that\nsediment yield and denudation rates are considerably\nhigher in these categories, especially as it has been\nshown that the slope failures associated with these land\nuses are considerably larger than those on khetland.\nIn order to assess sediment yield, it is necessary to\nmake some assumptions about the proportion of material\nreaching the drainage systems and to know the total\nareas under the respective land uses. Unfortunately,\nonly the areas under khetland, bariland, grassland, and\nforest are known with any degree of accuracy. Sal scrub\nis very difficult to define because it generally occurs on\nsmall parcels of land and is sometimes classed as abandoned\nland. But it was possible to estimate the total\narea under this land use. With respect to sediment\ndelivery ratio, the assumption made is that 100% of the\nfailed material with high connectivity exits the system,\nwhereas 50% of the failed material with moderate connectivity,\nand none of the failed material with low con-\nnectivity, leaves the slopes. Using these assumptions, the\naverage figures are 0.48 ton/ha/y for khetland,\n3.65 ton/ha/y for bariland, 1.86 ton/ha/y for grassland,\n0.80 ton/ha/y for forested land, and a massive\n23.95 ton/ha/y for sal scrub and abandoned land. In\nterms of average annual surface lowering, these figures\nbecome 0.039 mm for khetland, 0.29 mm for bariland,\n0.15 mm for grassland, 0.064 mm for forested land, and\n1.92 mm for sal scrub and abandoned land. These figures\nare probably on the high side because it is unlikely\nthat all the failed material with high connectivity leaves\nthe slope in the first year, and the figure of 50% for\nmedium connectivity is also probably high. However,\nalthough the figures are probably on the high side, they\ndo give some indication of the relative importance of\nlandsliding on specific land uses. The average denudation\nrate per year for the 3 years in the 4 subcatch-\nments, taking into account all the landslides on all land\nuses, was 5.56 ton/ha, producing a surface lowering of\n0.44 mm/y.\nThis average figure of 0.44 mm/y is based on 3 relatively\ndegraded south-facing catchments and 1 relatively\nnondegraded north-facing catchment. If it is assumed\nthat the entire drainage basin is composed half of\nhomogeneous north-facing and half of homogeneous\nsouth-facing catchments, the average denudation rate\nbecomes approximately 0.325 mm/y. This figure compares\nfavorably with previous estimates for denudation\nfrom landsliding in the Himalaya, such as 2.5 mm/y\n(Ramsay 1986), 1.7 mm/y (Bartarya 1988), and\n0.5–5 mm/y (Starkel 1972).\nThe denudation rates for landsliding can be compared\nwith those for soil erosion by overland flow. In\nthe Dee subcatchment the average soil losses per monsoon\nfor the years 1991–1993 were 5.5 ton/ha from\nbariland, 0.5 ton/ha from grassland, 0.5 ton/ha from\nlittle-degraded forest, 10.0 ton/ha from moderately\ndegraded sal forest, and 20.0 ton/ha from highly\ndegraded sal forest (Gardner et al 1995). Thus, bariland\nis more susceptible to the effects of overland flow,\nbut grassland is more susceptible to landsliding. Soil\nloss figures for highly degraded sal forest are high, both\nfrom landsliding and from erosion by overland flow.\nThis implies that the management of forestland is a\nmore critical factor in land degradation than the\nchange from forest to agriculture.\nDiscussion\nKhetland\nSmall slumps in khetland, usually involving only 1 terrace,\nare by far the most frequent of the slope failures.\nAlthough the failures are small, they result in large\ncosts for the farming community, and few farmers\nescape the experience of such failures. In a survey of\nfarmers, 16% said that they had experienced landslides\non their land in the past year (Blaikie 1995). The average\nperson days spent repairing and maintaining fields\nwas 14 days.\nKhetland failures are not randomly distributed but\ntend to cluster in specific locations. There appear to be\nseveral possible explanations for this clustering. Some\nfailures were clearly the result of water mismanagement.\nThe essence of the system of irrigated terraces is\nthat water passes through the system from terrace to\nterrace. Some farmers did not prevent the backward\nscour of water, which then cut into the base of the riser\nas water flowed from one terrace to the next one below.\nScour is facilitated on high, unvegetated risers and was\ngenerally seen to occur on groups of terraces. The softening\nof material in the risers as a result of irrigation\nmay also be a factor (Gerrard and Gardner 2000). Both\nthese factors will be more important where the terraces\nare double irrigated, and there is some evidence to sugTABLE\n4 Number of failures on\ndifferent land use types\nclassified by connectivity.\nConnectivity Khet Bari Grassland Landslide Sal scrub Forest\nLow 227 31 12 9 6 3\nMedium 12 2 7 3 5 2\nHigh 11 4 6 5 3 5\n', 'Research\n53\ngest that most of the single-terrace failures occur on\ndouble-irrigated khetland. Some of the clustering of\nfailures on lower slopes probably reflects this because\nthese lower terraces are capable of being double irrigated.\nTerraces that are irrigated twice per year require\nmore attention to ensure efficient water management.\nBariland\nThe number of failures on bariland was comparatively\nsmall, but these failures were often larger and exhibited\nhigher connectivity. There appear to be a number of\nreasons for this. Bari terraces are not susceptible to the\nsmall riser failures found on khetland because management\ntechniques and possibly soil texture are different.\nThere is not the same “softening” process or movement\nof water from terrace to terrace. Outward-sloping terraces\nwith a rear drainage ditch are efficient at moving\nsurface flow off the terraces, preventing a buildup of\nwater at depth. Also, bari terraces tend to be on the\nhigher slope areas with well-drained soils.\nHowever, failures do occur, and they tend to be\ndebris slides. Because of the system of deeply incised\nravines that form the main drainage system of the subcatchments,\ndebris slides on bariland often have direct\naccess to the river systems. Management is also a significant\nfactor. Many of the larger failures were on bari-\nland that had been temporarily abandoned. Also, the\nmajority of the abandoned bari terraces occur on the\nsouth-facing catchments where lack of water may be a\nproblem.\nGrassland\nMuch of the area classed as grassland is old bari terraces,\nsome of which have been left uncultivated to\nallow grass to grow for grazing or thatching. But most\nof the bari terraces now covered by sparse grassland\nhave been abandoned. They tend to be on the steeper\nupper slopes with thin soils, and there is little doubt\nthat these areas are now susceptible to slope failures\nand that the failure is most likely to be a debris slide.\nThe only relatively deep-seated rotational failures\noccurred on abandoned bari terraces.\nSal scrub and forestland\nThe type of failure on sal scrub is similar to that on grassland\nbut with an even higher proportion of debris slides\nand with a higher connectivity. Failures on forestland\nwere few but tended to be larger. This seems to accord\nwith the view expressed by Ives and Messerli (1989) that\nforested slopes may merely postpone the occurrence of a\nmajor landslide cycle and, by facilitating the production\nof a deeper debris mantle, ensure large-scale events with\nlonger recurrence intervals. Also, Upadhyay (1977) has\nargued that the most numerous and most spectacular\nlandslides are often under forest cover.\nOld landslides\nThe comparatively large number of failures in old landslides\nis significant; it emphasizes the potential continu-\ning instability if landslides are not repaired. It is likely\nthat many of the larger failures will not recover sufficiently\nby natural processes before failing again. Also,\nold landslides are prime locations for the occurrence of\noverland flow and gullying.\nConclusions\nThe following specific conclusions can be made:\n1. Although the number of slope failures in the 4 subcatchments\nappears large, most failures were small\nand had little or no impact on land degradation in\ngeneral.\n2. Most of the failures that occurred on irrigated khetland\nwere probably the result of water movement\nfrom terrace to terrace. These were small and easily\nrepaired, but they did have labor cost implications.\n3. Failures on cultivated bari terraces were rare but\nmore frequent when terraces became abandoned.\n4. Abandoned land, whether now grassland or sal\nscrub, possessed by far the highest landslide denudation\nrates.\n5. Failures within old landslides also contributed significantly\nto the overall denudation.\nThese results substantiate those of previous\nresearchers. Sarkar et al (1995) found that in the Alaknanda\nValley, Garhwal Himalaya, the highest percent-\nage of landslides occurred on barren lands, followed by\nsparsely vegetated, moderately vegetated, managed agricultural,\nand thickly vegetated lands. Similar results\nwere obtained by Bartarya and Valdiya (1989) in the\nKumaun Himalaya. Caine and Mool (1982) also noted\nthat terracing and irrigation increase the likelihood of\nfailure above that of unmodified slopes. But there is\nalso a counterbalance, a tendency toward stabilization\nas a result of farmers’ efforts to repair the damage\n(Kienholz et al 1984).\nThese results have implications for the continuing\nsustainability of the agricultural systems. Increasing\nthe area under khetland at the expense of bariland\nwill lead to more failures that will require careful management.\nAs noted by Ives and Messerli (1989), labor\nrequired to repair the more valuable khetland might\nlead to the neglect of bari terraces. The upper limit of\nirrigated terraces is being pushed slowly further up\nthe slopes where water supply becomes more uncertain.\nThis change may also have an impact on the\nnumber of failures on bariland. However, as Wu and\nThornes (1996) have shown, converting an identical\nslope from bari to khet does not necessarily produce a\n', 'AUTHORS\nJohn Gerrard\nSchool of Geography and Environmental Sciences, The University of Birmingham,\nBirmingham B15 2TT, UK. a.j.w.gerrard@bham.ac.uk\nRita Gardner\nDirector and Secretary, Royal Geographical Society with the Institute of\nBritish Geographers, 1 Kensington Gore, London SW7 2AR, UK.\nr.gardner@rgs.org\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project was funded by the UK Overseas Development Administration\nand coordinated by Soil Science (Nepal Agricultural Research Institute),\nRoyal Geographical Society, and Institute of Hydrology (Natural Environment\nResearch Council).

Abandoned land\nposes the greatest risk for continuing land degradation\nand may need to be controlled in some way. Certainly,\nthe proportion of abandoned land should be kept as\nlow as possible. This is in accord with Laban’s (1979)\nview that some of the most densely populated and\nextensively terraced areas possessed the smallest frequency\nof significant landslides. The input of human\neffort maintains a quasi-stability. Whether this quasi-stability\ncan be maintained if the land comes under even\ngreater pressure is difficult to say. Blaikie (1995) has\nnoted that badly eroded land tended to move from private\nto open access land when owners could no longer\ncope with the erosion, and management responsibility\nlapsed. This process may have important consequences\nfor medium-term sustainability.\nWhat implications do these results have for assessing\nthe landsliding component of the Theory of\nHimalayan Environmental Degradation? At the simplest\nlevel, if one assumes that the whole area was originally\nforested, then deforestation has led to an increase in\nthe number of slope failures but not necessarily to a significant\nincrease in denudation rates. The annual\ndenudation rate of 0.80 ton/ha/y for forested land can\nbe taken as the base. However, the value of\n0.48 ton/ha/y for khetland is below this value. Values\nof 3.65 ton/ha/y for bariland and 1.86 ton/ha/y for\ngrassland are higher but not excessively so, and there is\nlittle indication that such land is becoming severely\ndegraded. The high value of 23.95 ton/ha/y for sal\nscrub and abandoned land is of more concern. Fortunately,\nthe proportion of such land in the study area is\nlow. But this may not be so in other areas. The general\nconclusion is that deforestation does not necessarily\nlead to land degradation; much depends on the nature\nof the deforestation, the subsequent land uses, and the\nlabor input to repair landslide damage. \nDeforestation is probably too ambiguous a term to\nbe used in an unspecific manner. As Hamilton and\nPearce (1988) have noted, deforestation can be used to\ndescribe fuelwood cutting, commercial logging, shifting\ncultivation, and forest clearance for continuous annual\ncropping or for grazing. The subsequent land use is\nvitally important, as is the specific location where the\nchange is taking place. Thus, Jackson et al (1998) noted\nthat in 2 Middle Hill districts of Nepal, to the east of\nthe Kathmandu valley, shrubland and grassland at lower\naltitudes are being converted to forestland but that on\nthe upper slopes the forest cover is being denuded, and\nshrubland and grassland are increasing in extent. If the\nland is managed carefully with coordinated communal\neffort, serious land degradation from landsliding need\nnot occur.\nREFERENCES\nBartarya SK. 1988.
