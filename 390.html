J. Boland reached, Phoenix Saturday morning und Senator, Freeze rem rued on Sunday, says the, Phoenix Knterprise. They liotli speak, of Nome as the coming gold region and, predict for that camp a great future., Mr. Boland made good money while, there. Ho says tho Cabinet, owned by, Dick Dawson and others, Is the greatest, saloon and sporting house the world lias, ever known. On June 4. when tho, place opened, bar receipt-, ranged from, . $l,10l)tol,:t00aday. Now itrunsfrom, $00 to $!100 a day, even though there is, much opposition. Ten games run day, and night. The house won $.\'0,0011, without booking a loosing. Senator, Freeze says by autumn of next year, Dawson will come out with $liW,(MW or, S2(K),H.U, Speaking of the mines, Senator, Freeze says; Dawson this year will, produce 2(MK)(),0:i:). Nome is richer, and all the creeks are rich in placer, gold. The country is Ioi;ateil ftom the, ocean hack 41) miles. .NVarlv all the, Ariotians are at. the front and many, will make money. ".I. K.

There was no rain in, that section up to August 2d. this being, the dryestseason known, according to, the Esquimaux, so the rich placers con, tributed nothing to the support of, Nome, tho town being dependent on, money brought In. Then tho China, war gave us a fright. Three of the big, steamers were taken otT as transports, and we feared nothing would be left on, which to return, except the wind-jammers,, hence a number came out early., There will be but one month to work,, since the rain before winter begins. I, shall go back next year, especially if, the claim for which myself and Smith, Henbrook are negotiating is secured., Rest assured Nome is the richest known, gold Held, and it will prove a great, producer.", Santa Fe Orders Twenty Engines., The Santa Fe management has just, given orders for tuentv new passenger, engines, which will be used exclusively, in the company\'s California "limited", service.
