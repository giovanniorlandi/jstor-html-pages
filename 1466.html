If\nyou did, aud you failed to sea the rail\nroad exhibit you missed a wonderfully\nInteresting part of "the show.” You\nmissed seeing what may be called the\nevolution or development of that won\nderful Invention, the railroad engine.\nThe trouble Is that the hoys aud girls\nof to-day are so accustomed to the\nrailroad that they think little of all\nthat It represents. Some of them may\nbe like a little girl I happen to know,\nwho once said:\n"Why, papa, didn\'t we always have\nrsllrouds?”\nJust ask your grandparents about\nthat I have an idea that some of\nthem will tell you that they were men\nand women loug before they ever saw 1\na railroad engine. A man but forty\nlive years old told me the other day\nthat he walked teu miles with some\nother boys when be wus teu years old\nto see a railroad train.\nIt has not been so very many years j\n•luce tbe most intelligent men aud ■\nwomen laughed and even Jeered nt the\nmere Idea of people riding at the rate I\nof fifteen or twenty miles an hour, j\nWhen George Stephenson first began\nto talk about inventing an engine to\nbe run on lines of wooden or iron\ntrack, tbe people looked upon him as\na dreamer, a visionary who might not\nbe quite “right in Ills head.”\nBut this George Stephenson, of \\Yy\nlarn, near Newcastle, in England, was\nnot to be put down by sneers nor j\nJeers, and lie had the audacity to de- I\nelare that he could Invent an engine I\nthat would run at the terrific rate of\ntwenty-five miles an hour, whereupon\none of the most noted periodicals of\nthe day said that he ought to be "put\nIn a straltjacket.”\nStephenson went to work and built\na queer-looking little railroad engine\ncalled the "Koeket” In lffiP.t, and that\nwas the beginning of one of tile most\nUseful and wonderful things in the\nworld—the modern railway system.—•\nSt Nicholas.\nA Strungcr In Tuna.\nFifteen miles below the head of the\npasses of the Mississippi, and not far\nfrom where Southwest Pass loses it\n*>lf In the Gulf of Mexico, a little\nstream no wider than a village street\ncurves away from the mulu "pass.”\nAlong both sides are tiny landings,\nand back of each there Is a cottage.\nThe cottages are now neglected and\nforlorn, but once they were palm shad\ned. rose-guarded and lovely. There, in\nthe days wheu Southwest Pass was\nthe principal mouth of the Mississippi,\ndwelt the pilots who carried shins\nacross the bar.\n"Old Pilot-town" is bidden from the\ntraveler on the pass by a deuse cane\nbrake, and strangers seldom enter it\nfrom its bayou. Oue who did came\ndown the river In a skiff, and turned\ninto "old Pilot-town Bayou" at noou\nfor dinner. He found a ready meul\n■t the first cottage, where dwelt an\nold woman, widow of one of the old\ntirne pilots.

Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but\nalways under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or.imitation medicines\nThey are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes\nall standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class.pharmacy and. the finest and\nbest of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.\nThe earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits\nconferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest\nreward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of\nFigs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they\nare selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest\nremedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full\nname of the Company—California Fig Syrup Co.—printed on the front of every package.\nThey know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and\nof weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or\nover-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects as\nSyrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction.\nOwing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the\nimmense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are\nindividual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles\nof the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate\nto recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations\nsometimes have the name—“ Syrup of Figs”—or “Fig Syrup” and of some piratical concern,\nor fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of\nthe Company—California Fig Syrup Co.—printed on the front of the package. The imitations\nshould be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations\nthey find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes\noff on a customer a preparation under the name of “Syrup of Figs” or “Fig Syrup,” which\ndoes not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,\nhe is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his\nestablishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and\nand deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of\nphysicians’ prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.\nKnowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand\nfor our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every\nwhere, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions\nexist it is necessary to inform tiie public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return\nany imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company—\nCalifornia Fig Syrup Co.—printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the i\narticle and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class of I\ndruggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.^^1\n\\ ^ Cm', 'LAS VEGAS AGE\nLas Ttfu.
