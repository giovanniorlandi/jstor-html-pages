OF L/S\nPRORAM!\nQuestioning of Candidates by Organized\nWage Earners and Farmers\nSuccessful in Oklahoma.\nTime tests all things\'. The\nAmerican federation of Labor\'s\nnon-partisan program of joining\nwith other progressive organizations\nin questioning candidates for\nthe initiative and referendum has\nsucceeded in Oklahoma, and along\nwith the initiative and referendum\nthe delegates in the constitutional\nconvention framed a provision for\nthe termination of government by\ninjunction and other labor measures.\nThe constitution was adopted\nby the people by a three to\none vote.\nJust how it came about that this\nsignal success was achieved and in\na state where organized labor is\nnot so strong is stated in a letter\nby Grant Hamilton, general organizer\nlor the A. F. of 1 j. After describing\nsome of the more important\nfeatures in Oklahoma\'s constitution,\nhe says:\n"It is not generally known, but\nit is a fact, nevertheless, that the\nAmerican Federation of Labor laid\nthe foundation for the effective\nlegislation which appears in the\norganic law of the new state. The\nprovisions directly affecting labor\nwere achieved by the combination\nof three forces, namely, the Twin\nTerritorial Federation of Labor,\nthe Farmers\' Go-operative and Kd\nucational Union and the railroad\norganizations. Each of tiie forces\nmentioned were called together in\nconvention three years ago, even\nbefore it was known that the en\natmiig act wuum oe passcu [>y tungress\n\' *To Prepare The Ways and\n! Means to Gain .Recognition at tli<\'\nI Constitutional Convention, When\nj Convened."\n"The fact should be indelibly\n| impressed upon the minds of all\ntrades unionists, that the eleventh\nhour is not conductive to results.\nPreparation and a knowledge of\nthe subject in hand is the only har:\nbinger of success.\n"The organization referred to\nformulated tlieir plans as distinct\nbodies and then joined issues upon\nI a Joint Legislative Board plan.\nThe methods employed at once\nnmue tnese orgmiizaiioiis ivi\'imuable\nfactors in the framing of the\nnew constitution, anil practically\never provision championed by this\ncombined fore h is been enacted\ninto law.\n"And right here let it be dis\ntinctly undersood that this great\nachievement has been accomplished\nwithout the aid of partisan politics,\nso f ir as labor is concerned. This\nj is an object lesson that should not\n| go unobserved by that school of\nj economists, who insist that nothing\ncan be accomplishid without the\naid of a partisan political party.\nThe preliminary work of gather|\ning these forces together to crystall\nize the needs ol" the common people\nand formulate plans 10 carry them\ninto execution was.ontirely the work\nof the American Federation of\nLabor.\n\' There is a bit of interesting his\ntoi y connected therewith, that perhaps\nwiii never be told in full, but\nthe American Federation of Labor\nhad an antagonist in its laudable\nwork. A convention was held in\n.Muskogee, i. T., three years ago\nlast March, and at convention it\nwas endeavored to etfectually block\n] the A. F. of L. in its campaign.\nAttending this convention were\n! two eonspicious national eharac:\ntors, but their efforts to vitiate the\nplans of the trade unionists wore\ni unavailing.\n"The battle is now over and to\ni labor has been accorded in part its\n| rights.\nlivery State Federation and\n| Central Iiody should imforin its\n! members upon the policies pursued\nby the forces in Oklahoma. in\ni lact, LIic entire body of organized\ni labor with profit can follow more\n| closely the policies of the Amcri!\ncan Federation of Labor.\n| " It is results wc want.

They\ncarry with them the seeds of dissolution\nand disruption. Mo organization\ncan hope to prosper when it\nis handicapped with these drawbacks,\nand now that the entire\nmatter has been referred to the\nAmerican Federation of Labor for\nadjustment, that body should at\nonce take tiie matter up and re-as\nsemble the delegates to the last\nconvention and get right down to\nthe bottom of the whole affair and\nsettle the matter for once and all\ntime.\n\'There have been charges and counter\ncharges,some which have rellectcd\nupon the honor and integrity of\nthe delegates to the last convention\nand in all justice and fairness these\nrumors and charges should be set\ntied in open convention, where\nevery delegate would be- afforded\nan opportunity to vindicate him\nasvii. cjnui mis is clone the sti^im\nof disloyalty will hang over the\nhead of every delegate, be lie innocent\nor guilty.\nSo. brothers, lets get together\nand vindicate the innocent and let\nthe guilty reap the reward that is\naccorded to all traitors to our noble\ncause.\nGLAD TIDINGS.\nThe announcement given out by\nthe American Federation of Labor\nthat a determined effort would be\nmade this winter to organize West\nVirginia will be gladsome news to\nwage slaves of the state, and the\nmovement should receive tin\'- hearty\nco operation of every liberty loving\ncitizen in the Little Mountain\nState.\nThe through organization of the\ntoilers of West Virginia will sound\nthe death knell of the infamous\npeonage system, the notorious\n"guard"* and private detective\nevils, and the many other inhuman\nabuses that the laboring classes ere\nsubjected to in many sections of\ntiie State, and will result in the\nrapi : increase of our population\nand the development of our State.\nWhen it becomes known throughout\nthe country that working men\nm West Virginir enjoy the same\nrights and privileges that they do\nin other states there will be a great\nr-\'J\n: influx of practical and skilled\nworkers who will make good substantial\nand law abiding citizens\nwho will make it possible for West\nVirginia to forge to the front as the\ngreatest coal producing State in the\nunion.\nNow is the time to show your patriotism,\nget into the fight for the\ncause of humanity and assist in organizing\nthe toilers which means\nso much for our State, and her\ncitizens.\nNECESSARY WEAPON.\nAs every posted trade unionist\nknows, organized labor insists that\nits members have a right to stiker\nin order to accomplish the things\nthey are aiming at; and organized\nlabor would not, under and circumstances,\nreiinguish this right to\nstrike. If the members of organized\nlabor give up this right and\nthereby removed the possibility of\na strike they would get very little\nconsideration at the liands of some\nemployers. ? I hit the intelligent organized\nworkers use the strike with\ndiscretion. They do not resort to\nit for trifles, neither do they throw\ndown the gauntlet every time they\nhave a little difference with their\nemployer: "Come, let us reason\ntogether," and if the employer refuses\nto reason, or does not give\nthe proper consideration to their\ndemands, then, after exhausting\nall other honorable and peaceable\nmeans, and after weighing well the\nchances ol\' victory or defeat and\nafter selecting an opportune time,\nthey resort to the strike.\nThis is organized labor\'s position,\nconcerning the strike: as\ngiven by Compels and those whose\nposition and experience qualifies\nthem to speak authoritatively and\nintelligent\'1 v 011 the ir.-iltof\nThe member who is imbued will)\nthe true principles of organized\nlabor will not hesitate to go on\nstrike, 110 matter what sacrifices it\nentails; when it is necessary to get\njustice and when the arbitrary and\nunreasonable attitude of the employer\nshatters all hot<e of getting\njustice by peaceable methods, lint\nit is the aim of organized labor to get\njustice for the wage earners without\ntheir having to make the least\nunnecessary sacrifice; to spare them\nall the suffering that can be avoided\nby the employment of intelligent.,\npeaceable happiness without\nhaving to tread all the way on\nbriers.\nREAL BUSINESS BUILDER.\nYou will notice in the statistics\nsent out by the various commercial\nclubs and chambers of commerce,\nwhere they want to make an\nespecially good showing for their\nrespective cities, that they state\nhow many thousands of dollars are\npaid out each week for labor.\nYou have never heard of a chamber\nof commerce boasting about\nhow little money is paid to labor,\nhave von>\nIf the position of certain people\nl>e right, the correct style of boasting\nwould be something like this:\n\' We have here more than 20,000\nworkingmen, and the total weekly\nwage paid them is only !?2U,000;\ncome here where business is good.\nYou have never read such argument\nas that advanced in favor of\nany town, have you ?\nInstead of that you frequently\ni see figures showing that the average\nweekly wage of the working\n: iipnnli? i? wro\'itm- \'- 1\n, f b<vuwi i J?,iii in must\nj other cities, ami people are invited\nto make their homes in this\nj city where wages are high and\nwhere everybody is prosperous.\n| That is a common form of booming\na city, isn\'t it ?\nTo get right down to the bottom\nof the argument it should tirst be\nascertained what per cent of the\nworking man\'s wages get immedi|\nately into circulation. That is,\nwhat per cent of his wages does he\nspend here in the cit y ? What per\ncent does lie carry out of the country\nand spend in Kurope, or invest\nin Xew York real estate?\nAs a matter fact, and known of\nall men, practically every dollar\npaid out in this city as wages goes\nat once to the merchants, or to the\ni builder for a little home, or to the\ncoal dealer, or to some other kind\nfc.\nof work. That is to say, tin; brick\nmasou, jf lias money, pays out a . \'\nportion of it to the painter for j \'\npainting his house. after buying .*\n| food, and clothing.\nXow, if the working men had ; *\nonly one-half of the money they j *\nnow have, would it be a good ^\nthing or a bad thing for the busi- \'\n11ess of the place ? Would it help *\nthe merchant, or the other work- *\ningmen? Would it help the pul?- *\nlishers of the newspapers? Would \'\nthere be so many advertisements \'\nof merchandise? Would it help \'\nthe farmers who visit the city and\nsell vegetables and produce.

There is no business that can I\nbe conducted but that in some\nway relate! to society and it must\nbe subject to such regulations as\nsociety demands irrespective of the\nwill of the individual, or indi\n\\ luuius, who arc conducting the\nbusiness. The business of the employer\nand his business interests\nare no more independent than the\nbusiness of the employe and his\nbusiness interests, and both must\nobserve such limited rights as\nsociety may popularly impose upon\nthem.\nNow is the time for the members\nto show their interest in the work\nof building up the organization.\nThe tendency exists to shift this\nresponsibility upon the organizers\nand other paid officers. If\nthis is allowed to develop the\nmembers will wonder at the increased\ncost of management. If\neach member did his duty in this\nrespect the order would grow beyond\nour most sanguine expectations.\nAre the public service corporations\nof Charleston the servants of\nI the citizens, or are the citizens the\n| servants of the public service cor\nporations?

The\nstate aims to provide for each one a\ntrue home. At short intervals the\ncarefully selected commissioners investigate\nto Hud out if the child Is happy,\nhealthy and developing as It\nshould. When he Is thirteen years old\nhe is apprenticed to learn some useful\ntrade, and the state "keeps rigid supervision\nover him till lie reaches the ago\nof twenty-one.\nAs a result the development of the\n1 orphan Is in all respects similar tc\nthat of a child enjoying ordinary home\nrela*\' >ns. and In many instances tin\nfoster parents and the child become almost\nif not quite as deeply attached\nas though the little one had been born\nInto the home where It is adopted.\nHere we see civilization blossoming In\ngovernmental action.?Arena.\nA ROSTER OF NOTABLES.\nLabor Well Represented In National\nCivic Federation.\nj The labor representatives in the Civ\nic federation\' comprise Samuel Goutpers,\npresident of the American Federation\nof Labor: John Mitchell, president\nof the United Mine Workers of\nj America; Warren S.

Name of\n. riter must accompany all manuscript as\nguarantee of good faith.\nSOCIALIST NEWS.\nThe principles of Socialism are\nirohably as old as society, tlio not\nnown by this name. The\nollishness of man, gathering all\nio could for himself regard le,." -**f\nlit; welfare of others, and tliiis\neducing other to less comfort even\nu poverty and slavery. Passing\nvcr other references. We may say\nhat Jesus the (\'heist was the\nartiest pronounced Socialist. But\nust as the advocates of the sellish\nystems, suppressed all ellbrts at\nroedom and j)OX?ular sights, just so\nlie same class perverted the doctines\nof Jesus. They mystilied,\nnd spiritualized his plainest words\nml not able to utterly wipe out\nlie literal words, ther interpolated,\n;i nuch that the original intent of\nis teaching is lost in the mazes of\n[liritisin. This is well shown by\nle ilabel of voices of the dilferent\nhurclies and sects. Many Soeilists,\nnot knowing that tlie teachig\nof Jesus has been perverted\nroin socialism to gross idolitry,\nnd supposing the churches of to- I\nay correctly represent his teach- !\nig, turn from the churches as\nilse teachers, and fail to recognize\nesus as a teacher of tlie in-io?\niplcs ol\' right they would put in\nlactic.\'. Ilence conies the comlaint\nthat Socialists are opposed\nj religion. Unquestionably they\nre opposed to false religion, but |\nre they opposed to true religion?\n\'o ansnver that question requires a j\nelinition of true religion. The j\norld has never agreed on this;\nelinition. The churches do not [\ngree and Socialists take the same j\niberty of being their own judges!\nhat everybody else takes. And if I\nny man thinks lie knows we are\ncrong, let him attend our liivetngs\nand we will give him a reasonhie\ntime and a fair hearing to any\nrguments he can produce to show\nis our error. We meet oil next\nunday at 3 p. 111., in the smaller\nmil adjoining the Trades Assem>ly\nIlall on Capitol street.

The long headed men\nvho constitute the trusts are orgauizug\nthe industries of the world. They\nire showing farmers and wage work?rs\nhow to do business. They are syseuiizing\nproduction and distribution.\nriw.V ..<? *\n..... UI.1VU1UL-1.> IU\nage. iiud. remember, the full use < !\nnaohinery can only he had by organisation\nand system. The more complete\nhe organization the better will uui hlnory\nperform its service. The marhino\nIs a social institution, and Social\nsin proposes the completes! po> k\n>rg:miz.ation of those social forces in\nhe interest of the useful citizenship.\nFor this social service the trusts\n. barging their own price. Farmers . .-i\nA-ageworkers are not paying enough\nittention to their side of this so. ;\ncontract. They are producing alma\nlantly. but they leave the entire maiiigemcnt\nof the business, particularly\nhe transportation and distribution departments.\nto the trusts, and for their\n>\\vn useful services as working people\n.hey more or less meeTcl\'y. more or U-r\ngrumhlingly. take just what the trusts\nire forced to leave them. Instead of\n?-1.000 or Ss.i\'mM) p.-r year they u.unag.:o\nsubsist on $437.\nIt is well known that "the law is a\n">nrt of every contract." and Socialists\nit least understand that political purties\nare the social representatives of\nthe economic classes?workingnien :::i !\ncapitalists. That t!ie laws are nmd?ind\nadministered by the politicians of\nboth old Darties in the interest of card\nI talis ts, of labor exploiters, Is plain, ana\nj when n farmer ur wage worker votes\nI for ll:e politicians of either old i>arty\nhe votes for $137 per year Instead of\n$1,000 or more. He votes Into every\ncontract laws In the Interest of the:\nexploiting capitalist class, and these ]\n: laws Ex the relations with the masters \'\n: of the "system." If the giant Labor be\n| in chains it is because he votes to wear J\nI those chains.\nThe secret of the success of big cap- {\nj ital is not so much of a secret after all. i\nj Big capital organizes and systeinlzes\n| its business. It doubles, trebles acl\nquadruples the productive power of\nlabor. It cuts off waste. It commands\nthe use of the best machinery against\nwhich small capital using inferior machinery\nand n poorer system cannot\nsuccessfully compete. It causes goods to\nbe produced cheaper, sells at less expense\nand tints takes the market from\nthe little old foglc < who hang to the\nold methods. Thus the trusts are creating\na small class of capitalist owners\nand a large class of wageworlters.\nThe little independent producers, who\nare mostly farmers, are being squeezed\nout. Capital Is socializing industry.\nLet labor now proceed to the socialization\nof capital. Toward this we are\nrapidly proceeding in the due course of\nsocial growth. The air is full of Socialism.\nIt is all around us. Even now\nwe are In the midst of the social revolution.\nBut capitalists now dictate the terms\nupon which labor produces and exchanges.\nLabor scarcely has a voice\nin the matter. Capital takes the cream\nbecause we consent to this one sided\nbusiness arrangement. We protest, we\ngrumble, we kick, but we consent.\nIIow do we consent? We consent with\nour ballots, and we can only withdraw\nour consent by casting our votes for\nmore complete Socialism. In the arrangement\nof the terms upon which\nlabor serves society the ballot is labor\'s\nonly voice. If be is satisfied that the\npresent capitalist class shall absolutely\ndictate these terms lie does well to vote\ncither old party ticket. If he wants\nthe $4,000 per year standard of living\ninstead of the $-137 standard lie must\nvote for it. Farmers and wage worker\'s\nget just what they vote for.?From\n"Letters From a Farmer," by C. J.\nLamb.\nThe Class Struggle.\nThe class struggle began with tlie|\nprehistoric tribal wars and can end\nuui.v wueii me iiiuorors can no delivered\nfrom the inheritance of industrial ,\ndisaster handed down to tliem from j\nthe fortunes of barbarian warfare. \'\nThis class struggle was shown in the\nservile rebellions when slavery had\nbeen made the status of the workiugm.m.\nThis class struggle was shown \'\nin the labor unions and the strikes\nwhen the wage system had been fas- \'\ntoned on the toller, when he had been j\nrobbed of any opportunity to use the j\nresources of the earth In .? own right, t\nhad been refused the right to live\nwithout a master and had not been j\nguaranteed even tlie right to have a i\nmaster. This class struggle is shown |\nnow In the struggle for Socialism, I\nwhich Is no new thing In the world. It |\nIs tlie same old warfare, at last informed\nas to the nature of the rights of\nthe toilers and equipped with the pow- I\ner of the ballot In the struggle to se- j\ncure these rights.?John Stuart Mill.
