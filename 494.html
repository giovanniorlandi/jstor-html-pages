They are even carrying American arms.\nThey entered the war through their pact with France. They left\nit through the machinations of the Huns.

The\nBritish government soon will launch\na 10,000,000-pound scheme for in\ncreasing the cultivation of flax in\nIreland, owing to the importance of\nflax for the manufacture of airplane\nwings. Estimates by exports show\nthat the quantity of flax usually\ngrown in Ireland would not be suf\nficient in the coming year for this\nand other demands. Farmers who\nown land suitable for the purpose I market\nwill be offered subsidies, and the\ngovernment probably will secure in\naddition large areas of land In the\nmidlands and south of Ireland.

Marshal Joffre\'s high per\nsonality did not save him from the\nformality and thus the official re\nquest was made. .\nThe entrance of Marshal Joffre\ninto the academy will not create a\nprecedent as far as the admittance\nof military men to the select circle\nla concerned. Six marshals of\nFrance have already been recorded\nas members. They were Villars,\nd\'Estress, the Duke of Richelieu,\nBelle-Isle, Beauvan and Duras.\nIt is an error, however, to think\nthat Marshal Joffre will receive the\ngreen palms of the Immortals With\nout ever having written anything.\nIn 1895 there was published in Paris\na 75-page volume entitled, "The Op\nerations of the Joffre Column Before\nand After the Occupation of Tim\nbouctou." It was signed J. Joffre,\nLleutena nt-Colonel.\nMarshal Joffre also wrote a work\non Madagascar, but the edition has\nbecome exhausted and no cony of it\ncan be found at present.
