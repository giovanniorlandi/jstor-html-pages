For three months\nwe have been occupied with the\nwork of repairing the Victor shaft,\nwhich prevented us from hoisting any\nore from that quarter and leaving\nthe mill to be supplied from No. 2\nshaft, which also had to handle all\nthe waste, taxing it pretty heavily\nto keep the mill going. The comple\ntion of the repairs on the Victor\nenables the company to develop the\norebodies on the lower levels. Since\nmy last visit here there has not been\nany development done below the 1350\nlevel of the No. 2 shaft.

At times the sullen sky\nin the distance, which contrasted with the brightness overhead in\nTonopah, was illumined with splashes of vivid splendor. Suddenly\na tongue of fire shot from the firmament, the hum of life in Tonopah\nstopped with the suddenness of a shock and all was still. The hoists\nceaied their musical whir, the mills sank into silence as the\nponderous stamps were hung up or stood still in the mortars, lights\nin dark corners expired and the camp was hushed. The only local\nindication was a monument of flame that shot from the lightning\narrester at the substation as the electricity from above shot through\nthe intricacies of wiring devised for the purpose of preventing the\ningress of dangerous currents from the Jovian amphitheater.\nFourteen miles away lightning had struck the power system and\ninstantaneously the full force of the shock eame tearing into the\nsubstation with a voltage that would have destroyed the structure\nand crippled the system had it not been for the various scientific\ntraps designed to divert the vagrant current into safe channels.\nThe delay was not long. It only lasted thirty minutes. Down\nunderground, miners stood or sat at their stations waiting for the\npower to come on. Drills hung in the holes and trammers found\nthe gangway at the silent shafts congested. A general halt\nensued. Taken in detail the loss was momentary, but, viewed on the\nwhole, every company suffered seriously from enforced idleness.\nComing as it did close to the change of shifts the stoppage found\nthe runners just about completing their rounds of holes, but the\ntime was so limited that they could not finish their assigned quan\ntity, which hail to be left to the next shift, and in this way the\nservice was impaired to the extent of almost four hours\' delay. In\nthis altitude, especially on the desert where ther are no high\nobjects in the shape of trees or natural growth to attract the shafts\nof electricity, it is almost impossible to control the elements of\nNature that interrupt the invisible traffic carried over the wires\nfrom the summit of the Sierras, 110 miles away, over two ranges of\nmountains. The lines of poles strung over the face of Nature for\nthis distance are the most conspicuous objects on the landscape,\nand thus the lightning finds lodgment in these poles. The voltage\nof lightning in this altitude is of incalculable magnitude and science\nhas not been able to grapple successfully with the problem of\ncontrolling the mysterious force extracted from the clouds.\nThe power company has had its electricians busy with this\nsubject for many years, but the solution appears to be as far\ndistant as at any time, notwithstanding the steady and revolutionary\nadvance in the science of electricity. A correction of the evil would\nmean a sensible reduction of an aggravation that at this season\nbecomes a source of great annoyance.\nLARGEST GEMS IN\nWORLD GIVEN KAISER\nGERMAN EMPEROR PRESENTED\nFINE SET OF TURQUOISE\nBY PERSIAN PRINCE\nII r Aeurlatrd Preee.1\nVIENNA, July 14.

It makes no differ\nence how long you have heen in Nevada or how long you have been\nliving in Tonopah, with or without a change of residence, it is\nabsolutely necessary that you register, if you intend voting at the\nprimaries on August 8. While there are nearly ninety days ahead\nfor the completion of the work of polling citizens for the general\nelection, the duty should not be postponed but should be done now,\nwhen the registrar is able to give his attention to the applicant\nwithout entailing any delay. It is important that a full vote should\nbe brought out for the primaries, when the delegates will be chosen\nto nominate officers. If you go to the office of Justice of the Peace\nDunseath the business of registering can be dispatched in the course\nof a couple of minutes. If the voter prefers to wait until the\napproach of the last day reminds him of the fleetness of time he\nwill have to wait the time and pleasure of the registering officer,\nwho will be occupied with hundreds of other dilatory citizens.\nThe new voter is not required to state her age, which at all\ntimes is a matter of some delicacy, as the law provides that the\napplicant simply affirms that she is twenty-one and therefore\nifil.

The nation has suffered from the four years\' dalliance\nwith a wavering policy and is now ripe for a return to the firmness\nand patriotism of a Republican administration.

Unconfirmed re\nports that. Prince Edward Albert of\nWales, heir apparent to the British\nthrone, seeks the hand of Princess\ntolanda, the eldest daughter of King\nVictor Emanuel of Italy, have excited\nwidespread discussion here. The ru\nmor Is a surprise to Italians generally\nfor It had been supposed that the\nBritish prince would marry one of\nthe daughters of Emperor Nicholas\nof Russia, but there are a number of\nincidents that have led the Italian\npeople to believe that Prince Edward\nwill marry Princess Yolanda.\nIt is now stated that the reason of\nha visit of the duke of Connaught\nto the Italian king In May was to\npresent the formal request ot me\nking and queen 01 ungianu iur mo\nband of the Princess Yolanda. The I\nprincess is only fifteen years old and (\nM prince Is only twenty-two. She\nreceived an English education from \'\nbabyhood under the tutelage of an\nEnglish governess. Miss Brown, and\nthose who know her intimately have\nspoken of her as one of the best j\nmarriageable prospects In European\nroyal families. She is said to be an\nextremely sensible and practical girl, \'\nhavlnf been brought up in a family \'\nthat is peculiarly domestic, and being\nthe oldest girl In the family the royal\nIntimates say she has been regarded\nas the "boss" of the household. She\nhas always acted as the protectoress\nof her younger sisters and her\nbrother, Prince Humbert. Sometimes\nshe has extended this role even to\nher mother, the queen. The latter,\none one occasion recently, when\nspeaking to the American wife of an\nItalian journalist, Bald: "I rarely\nattempt to speak English because\nYolan4a inslBts on correcting my\nmll?." f\nTh princess strongly resemble\nner mother, having dark hair and\neyes, an olive complexion, and the\nglow smile not unlike the famous\none In the Mona Lisa paintings. She\nhas been given even mora of the\nmodern outdoor education than many\nNEW TODAY\nNEW TODAY\nof the Italian girls who have fol\nlowed the English and American cus\ntom. She plays tennis well, rides,\nswims and is an excellent pistol and\nrifle shot. Since the war began she\nhas been the constant companion and\naid of her, mother In the work among\nthe poor families of soldiers and in\nthe hospitals, particularly the latter.\nThe princess is a catholic and the\nEnglish law does not allow of the\noccupancy of the British throne by\na Catholic, but among those who\nwish to see the marriage carried out\nit la recalled that in recent years\ncertain princesses have changed their\nreligion In order to become queens.\nThe queen of Spain became a Catho\nlic on her marriage, while the queen\nof Greece adopted the religion of the\ncountry for the same reason.\nShould the marriage not take place\nthe fact may some day develop that\nIt was because the princess so willed.\nThe Italian royal family is known to\nbe sufficiently converted to demo\ncratic ideas not to insist on a wed\nding which the princess fails to view\nwith full approval. As the throne\nof Italy cannot be Inherited by a\nwoman, the marriage of a royal prin\ncess has not the far-reaching political\nimportance that is true in the case\nof the prince of wales. The war\nhaving apparently eliminated both\nGerman and Austrian suitors, if the\nPrincess Yolando married In neither\nEngland or Russia, she may after all\nmarry in Italy, where many of the\nprincely houses consider themselves\nquite as good as the house of Savoy.\nThe Italian royal family is far\nwealthier than the English royal\nfamily, being rated only second to\nthat of Russia In wealth, and much\nof this wealth is in cold cash, not In\nundeveloped lands.\nIt Is proposed to give the king of\nSwain the Nobel peace prize this year.\nJ but it seems as if it ought- to be\nsplit wlin l onsianune oi ureeun,\nhas even more wife\'s relatives.\nGrand ItapldB Press.\nQnhari-Uta for th vnn\nW\n4f44iafaf4r4\nCHANGE IN OWNERSHIP\ntourists\' Garage Machine Shop j\nWE ARE AUTOMOBILE DOCTORS\nBRING YOUR TROUBLES TO US.\nBERT WHITNEY & BROS., Lower Main St. i\n000000am0mJu000\nWedding Presents\nMidsummer is Mating T Ime\nPresent the Bride with\nsomething classy out of\nmy stock\nI.

Erickson, trustee,\nwas so as aforesaid made without\nany consideration therefor being re\nceived by said defendant corpora\ntion and was made solely and only\nfor the purpose of hindering and de\nlaying the actual ana bona fide own\ners of said preferred stock from\ninvoking legal process for the en\nforcement of their rights and the\nforeclosure of said trust deed."\nIn view of the fact that recently a\nconsiderable block of preferred atock\nIn the corporation was sold under\nforced sale to H. R. Cooke, attorney\nfor the plaintiff. It is generally be\nlieved and admitted by the plaintiffs\nrepresentatives that the present ac\ntion . in foreclosure is a necessary\nstep that is being taken in the pro\nposed merger of the Manhattan Con\nsolldated with the White Caps, to\nthe end that there will be as com\nplete financial rehabilitation of the\nformer as there has been with the\nlatter company, the combined acre\nage to be developed extensively and\nplaced in the producing class with\nthe least possible delay.\nBosch Service Station.

Bergerson, traveling freight and\npassenger agent of the Southern Pa\ncific, Is enthusiastic over the pros\npects of Nevada to make a wonderful\nrecord production this year.\n"Few people of this state know\nthat Iron Is included in the minerals\nproduced here, but this is a fact and\nthe mine In former \' days shipped\nfrom five to eight carloads a day to\nthe smelters at Salt Lake. In com\ning through Beowawe the other day\nI learned that this mine, known as\nthe Barth mine, is about to be re\nopened as quickly as the workings\ncan be unwatered. The pumps have\nalready started after an Idleness of\neighteen months and before the next\nninety days tonnage will begin mov\ning from this property. The location\nIs excellent for economy as the mine\nis situated within 300 yards of the\ntracks between PallBade and Beo\nwawe. The product goes to the Salt\nLake smelters, which are In the\nmarket for all grades of fluxing ores.\nThe Buckhorn mine has cleaned up\nmost of its. material which has been\nshipped to Goldfleld.\n"Liming Is the big surprise of the\nyear. The company employs four\nmen at the station unloading cars,\nwhere only a few months ago one\nman did not have enough to keep\nhim busy. Copper ore is going out\nto the Murray smelter at the rate of\nsix cars a day and we look for an\nIncrease as soon as shipping facilities\nat the mines are developed."\nFRANCE MAY BUILD\nTUNNEL TO ENGLAND\nALLIES PLAN TO ESTABLISH\nRAPID LAND AND 8EA\nTRANSPORT\nBy Aaaorlaled Prcae t\nLONDON, July 14.
