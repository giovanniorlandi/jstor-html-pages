        <pre>['THE ONALDSONVILLE RIEF.\nA Wide-Awake Home Newspaper--Published Every Saturday-Subscription Price, $2 a Year.\nVOLUME XLVIII. DONALDSONVILLE,- LA., SATURDAY APRIL 28, 1919. - NUMBER 48,\n... ga g, ,,... . IM .. M I NIUMBI I,\nPhotoplay News\n"Satan, Jr."\nW. l diileeted, beautifully photo\n,gr.1dhn\'d., alive with snappy situations,\na vtr..y v:hirlwinid of fun, this produc\ntion presents a wonderfully appropri\nate comely setting for the dainty\npersonality of clever little Viola\nDana who plays the leading role. It\nis the sort of screen entertainment\nwarranted to extract a smile from\nthe most melancholy cynic and, un\nlike the majority of comedies, main\ntains the atmosphere of suspense in\nthat one is kept wondering what sort\nof a mad per formance the Satanically\nenergetic, petite heroine is likely to\nin(lulge in ne:x, and the nature of the\ncomplications that may result there\nfrom. Miss I)ana\'s portrayal of wil\nful Diana is prettily conceived and\nSrefreshingly natural, and she is ably\nsupported by other members of the\ncast. "Satan, Jr." will be shown at\nthe Grand tomorrow.\n"Puppy Love."\nLila Lee shows signs of marked im\nprovement in eaCth production where\nshe takes the lead and her work in the\npresent instance tends to still further\nincrease her popularity with the f s\nof filmdom. Her impersonation of\nromantic Gloria is replete with child\nish grace, delightfully natural and\nscores a distinct hit. The producers\nshow good judgment in the selection\nof a cast, every member of which ren\nders excellent service. The spinster\ntypes are especially amusing, Emma\nGerdes\' performances as Phyllis Win\nters being particularly worthy of\nmention, and the trials and tribula\ntions of the fat boy, portrayed by\nLincoln Stedman, offering much food\nfor mirth. Don\'t fail to see "Puppy\nLove" at the Grand Monday.\n"Virtuous Wives."\nThis picture, which will be the at\ntraction at t!.e Grand Tuesday, is\nelaborately produced and extremely\nwell acted. The story is a pungent\nsatire on society, and it is only at the\nend that any real effort is made to,\nwin sympathy for tlhe foolish littlei\nwife whose xy.Wllyi1ntentioqnedZ\nin a perfect hpt-bed\' of temln .\nwhile he betakes himself to a A,\nsteel mill in Colorado and slives and\nbemoans the fate that keeps him and\nhis wife apart. When he learns that\nthe lady who bears his name is being\ntalked about for the way she is con\nducting herself with- a certain Monte\nBracken, he hurries to New York andt\ndemands an explanation. Matters\nare so badly tangled that Andrew\nForrester concludes the only decent\nthing for him to do is to withdraw in\nfavor of\' the other man. He goes\nback west alone, but his wife follows\nhim and makes him understand that\nshe has always loved him. Anita\nStewart is so attractive as Amy For\nrester it is quite beyond belief that\nher husband would have arranged a\nseparation for one week, let alone a\nwhole year. The satire on society\nthat runs through the story deals\nwith an up\'to-date subject and it is\nbiting enough to cause many hearty\nlaughs.\n\'The Racing Strain."\n+ This picture will he pi.esented at\nthe Grand next \'l\'hu rsda and th.e1\nwho witness it will see anot!her "Poliv\nof the Circus," featu in;,, Mae Marsh,\nThe daughter oi (ol)o..l ameron,\na Kentucky horsem:ni:.

Some of those\nwho are posted on the situation as\nsert that at the proper time a full\n:icket will be launched, composed of\nsome of the presnet office-holders and a\n)ther aspirants for political prefer- C\nnent who have become associated\nNith them, and who together will go a\nbefore the people of the parish and\nseek their endorsement at the polls.\nThe personnel of the ticket which\nit is said has been tentatively agreed t\nupon, is reported to be as follows: d\nDr. D. C. Brumfield, sheriff; Jas. S.\nBarman, clerk of court; Sidney A.St.\nAmant, assesdbr; Dr. P. T. Thibodaux, i\ncoroner; H. A. Morgan, representa\ntive. t\nThis ticket, it is said, will oppose ,\nthe candidates of the faction head\ned by Sheriff E. C. Hanson, who have\nnot yet announced, but who it is ex\npected will come out in the not dis\ntant future.\nDr. Brumfielk has occupied the of\nfice of coroter of the parish for the\npast eight yea~s and is popular with\nthe people of the New River section\nas well as those of the other wards of\nthe Dish. Mr. Barman has been\nclerk of court for the past sixteen\nyears, and by tlte business-like and\norderly manher in which he has con\nducted his office, making it one of the\nbest kept in the state and his polite\nand courteous treatment 9f all those\nwho have business with it, has\nmade himself\' one of the strongest 1\nmen, politiilly, in Ascension. Mr.\nSt. Amant, who was elected assessor\nthree years ago, has done much ~\nward eqalizing the assessments of the\nparish and it is conceded, that as a\nresult ,of his good work the assess\nments are in .better shape today than\nthey have ever been. Dr. Thibodaux\nhas filled at different times the posi\ntions of coroner and health officer of\nthe parish. He is well known and\nhas many friends in every section of\nAscension. During the war, he\nvohinteered for enlistment in the\nmedical corps of the army and waBs\naccepted, and he laid aside a large\nand lucrative practice to devote his\nentire time and skill and his best ef\nforts to the service of his country.\nMr. Morgan has represented Ascen\nsion in the legislature since 1916, and\nis popular throughout the parish.\nWhen the candidates of this ticket\narnd the candidates of the ticket\nwhich it is expected will be launched\nby Sheriff Hanson and his friends and\nfollowers begin an active canvas\nmo . voters,. it is safe to prediet\ntin antil thdy of. ection.\nyICTORY LIBERTY LOAN.\nThe campaign for the Victory Lib\nerty Loan was inaugurated through\nput the country last Monday under\nmost favorable auspices, and reports\nfrom all sections indicate that the\npeople are coming forward and sub\nscribing to this loan with the same\npatriotic liberality :which character.\nized their\' actions in the campaigns\nfor the other loans floated in the\npast.\nThe quota of the: present loan al\nlotted to the parish of Ascension is\n$145,000, divided\' up as follows:\nFirst ward, $16,000; second ward,\n$7000; third ward (Donaldsonville),\n$50,000; fourth ward, $7000\'; fifth\nward, $9000; sixth ward, $10,000;\nseventh ward, $30,000; eighth ward,\n$16,000.\nAlbert Delery, president and\ncashier of the Commercial and Sav\nings Bank of this city is chairman 1\nthe loan campaign in the parishes of\nAscension and Iberville. He reports\nthat most satisfactory progress is be\ning made in both parishes, and ex\npresses the belief that each will sur\npass its quota.\nThe people of Donaldsonville and\nAscension are urged to do their full\nshare in way of subscribing to this\nloan as they \'did in the past. The\ngovernmo t needs the money and it\nis the .ty of all loyal citizens to\nshow their patriotism by lending to\nthe government according to their\nmeans. The lob is absolutely safe,\nbeing backed byall of the unlimited\nresources of the country, and besides\nit bears a substantial rate of interest,\nwhich makes it a secure and attrac\ntive investment. Besides, the terms\nof payment for the bonds are easy,\nthus placing them within the reach\nof man with a moderate salary as\nwell as the man with extensivE\nwealth.\nDances at Hotel Donaldson.\nThe first of a series of bi-monthly\ndances will be given, at the Hotel\nDonaldson on Saturday night, May\n2.

C. Hanson and\n"hief of Police Robert E. Dill, in\n:ompliance with the request of the\nsheriff of the parish of St. James,\nreceived over telephone. A Cadillac\nautomobile belonging to the City\n3arage Co. of New Orleans, was\ntaken from the men by the officers\nmnd turned over to the manager of\n;he concern who came here from the\ncrescent City to recover his property.\nIt appears from the confession ob\ntained by the sheriff from Bou\niraux that Henry Thibodaux. rented\nthe car from the company with a\nchauffeur named Willie Jackson, and\ninvited Boudreaux to take a trip with\nhim, promising to secure him a posi\ntion in some town in south Louisim(..\nThey started up the river towards\nthis city and when they reached the\nVacherie settlement in St. Jemes\nparish, Thibodaux assaulted the\nchauffeur with a blunt instrument\nand threw him out of the car, be\nlieving him to be either unconscious\nor dead. Thibodaux then took the\nwheel and drove the car at great\nspeed, passing through Donaldson\nville he started down the bayou to\nward the town of Thibodaux, where\nit is believed he intended to dispose\nof the car for what he could obtain\nfor it and board the first train out\nfor some point far away..\nBut the chauffeur, who was left\nfor dead in the public road at\nVacherie, was only stunned by the\nblows dealt him and soon recovered\ns.fficiently to give the alarm. Sheriff\nDornier of St. James was notified by\ntelephone and he in turn communi\ncated with Sheriff Hanson of this\nparish and the latter, having learned\nof the route taken by the thieves im\nmediately set out in his automobile,\naccompanied by Chief of Police Dill,\nin pursuit of them. The fugitives\nwere overtaken on the bayou about\neight miles below this city. When\nhalted and questioned Thibodaux\nsaid that he h&d purchased the\ncar on that day in Donaldsonville\nfrom a man named Hanson. They\nwere placed under arrest and brought\nto town and the sheriff of St. James\nnotified. A deputy from that parish\ncame after the prisoners Tuesday and\nthey are now. safely lodged in jail,\ncharged with assault with intent to\nmurder and the theft of an automo\nbile.\nEaster at Methodist Church.\nA good-4ized-erowd attadendf Ester,\nrvices at the Methodist church last\'\nSunday.

The\nsuccess of the festivities was largely 1\ndue to the efforts of Miss Blanche\ndHarrison in drilling the children.\nThe regular Easter collection for the\norphans was $20.75 from the Donald\nsonville congregation, and $13.50\nfrom Vacherie. Reports from other\nchurches have not yet been received.\nThe centenary minute men\'s\nspeeches at-every religious gathering\nis proving beneficial in that so much\nmissionary information is dissemin\nated in a few words. Already the\nwork of the missionary, centenary is\nbeginning to count in the large plans\nfor the benefit of Louisiana. The\nheadquarters have mailed out plans\nfor financing Rhissionary work, which\ncontemplate the construction of a\nmodern settlement house in New Or\nleans at a cost of $116,000. The\nMethodists of south Louisiana are to\nreceive full benefit for everything\nthey contribute to the campaign. The\nlocal church\'s quota is $4000 for five\nyears, or $800 per year, which is\nabout two-fifths more than has here\ntofore been contributed to the same\ncause. Every member of the con\ngregation will be canvassed during\nthe week of May 18-25, and asked to\npledge this maximum for the five\nyears; payments to be made in terms\nto suit the subscribers.\n666 has more imitations than any\nr other Chill and Fever TonTc on the\nmarket, but no one wants imitations\nl in medicine.

Mr.\nDunning is too well known to our old customers to need an introduc\ntion, but to those of more recent date we wish to state that Mr.\nDunning operated the first machine tool brought to Donaldsonville.\nAfter years of service in the old Donaldsonville Foundry and Allen\'s\nFoundry he served for several seasons as chief engineer in some of\nthe leading sugar houses of the state and has just resigned a fine\nposition in the Vicksburg shops of the Y. & M. V. Railroad. This\nmultifold experience taken with the fact that Mr. Dunning\nis a Technical school graduate and that he is strictly sober and\nreliable, should be sufficient guarantee that any work intrusted to\nour care will be in competent hands.\nIn recognition of the valuable services rendered this institution\nin the past twenty years by its employees and the equally valuable\npatronage extended to it by its numerous friends, Mr. Allen deems\nit only just to make it a profit-sharing shop, and a liberal proportion\nof its profits will be divided between these, our friends and bene\nfactors.\nF. H. ALLEN.\nLevee Board Meeting Fails.\nA number of prominent men from\nhe parish of Lafourche, composing a\nommittee of the police )ury and cit\ncens of that parish, came to Donald\nonville Thursday to appear before a\nieeting of the joint executive com\niittee of the Lafourche and Atchaf\nlaya Levee Boards, scheduled to\ne held here on that day. The com\nnittee was composed of Judge Faw\naan Thibodaux of Raceland, and Os\nar Dresner of Lockport, represent\nng the police jury, and E. F. Dickin\non, Alex Barker and Dr. J. J. Ayo,\nll of Raceland, representing the citi\n;ens.. But owing to the lack #of a\nluorum the meeting did not ma\nerialize.\nThe purpose of the meeting was to\nsear discussions, pro and con, on the\noute selected for the proposed grav-.\nd road along Bayou Lafourche, from\n,ockport to Theriot Canal.\nIt appears that about four years\ntgo the citizens of that section voted\n. special tax for -the building of !\'\nroposed road, and turned the mat\ner of construction over to the state\nzighway engineers. A survey was\npromptly made; the road was graded\nand the work of laying the gravel\nwas begun. It seems that the pro\nposed road, at certain points, passed\nwithin fifteen feet of th.e water\'s\nedge, and the levee boards in dredg\ning the bayou in this section, found\nit necessary to deposit the earth ex\ncavated on this new road, covering it\nin some places to a depth of four or\nfive feet. Thereupon the work of\ngraveling was stopped, and -negotia\ntions were opened with the levee\nboards looking to an adjustment of\nthe matter.\nIn the negotiations the levee boards\ntook the position that a space of at\nleast 75 feet wide was required for\ndepositing the earth removed from\nthe bayou and advised against the\nbuilding of roads within that dis\ntance. It is said that the majority\nof the citizens of that section ap\nproved of the stand taken by the\nlevee boards.\nCharles Matthews, one of the\nlargest land owners of that part of\n,the parish, whose plantations have a\nfrontage of about three miles on the\nbayou, -within the distance to be\ntraversed by the propo ed new road,\nwas, also here to appear before the\nmeeting. It is said that he contends\nthat the, road -should be built along\nthe \'route surveyed andgraded by\nthe engineers And his contention\ndoes not seem to be without justice,\nwhen it is asserted that to remove\nthe road along his plantations, 75\nfeet from tie :water\'s edge, will de\nprive him of many acres of rich cul\ntivatable land,. and cause him to in\ne, cpnsiderable expense in moving\nback several :;mammoth warehouses,\nwhich now stabnd on the batture near\nthe edge of t elihnnel. But italso\nseems that the requirements of the\nlevee boards ~sae entitled to some\nconsideration since they must have\nroom to place the earth which they\nremove from the bottom of the bayou.\nIt is very much to be hoped that\nsome means will be found by which\nthe matter can be adjusted to the\nsatisfaction of all concerned, and\nthis .stretch of road which is said to\nbe a very important link in\' the\ngraveled highways of the parish, con\nstructed without further delay.\nTransferred to Algiers.\nChief Ship Fitter John Ramirez of\nthe U. S. Navy, left last .Tuesdiy to\nresume his duties, and will henceforth\nbe located at the Algiers navy yard\nto which he has been transferred\nfrom the government yards at New\nLondon, Conn. Mr. Ramirez has\nbeen in the navy a little over twelve\nyears and express himself as exceed\ningly well pleased with the duties of\nhis position, which is one requiring\nlong training and aptitudge\' for the\nwork.

That\nthe Sixth Federal Reserve District\nwill go over the top with a bang is\nindicated by the early results, though\nit will require the co-operation of every\ncitizen to make success assured.\nThe announcement of the terms of\nthe Victory Loan did a great deal to\ninspire subscriptions from those who\ninvested from a business standpoint as\nwell as from patriotic motives. The\nnotes pay 4 3/4%, the highest interest\nof any of the Liberty Loan series, and\nare payable by the government in four\nyears after date. d\'his high intere\'\'\nand the short term makes them ce\ntain to remain at a high figure, finan\nciers say, and there will be no dan\nger of their dropping to a discount.\nSecretary Carter Glass has announc\ned positively that this.will be the last\nof the Liberty loans. It will pay the\nbill for defeating the Hun and bring\nthe boys back home.\nThe campaign all over the district\nwas opened with parades and great\ncelebrations. In Atlanta the central\npart of the cjty was more elaborately\ndecorated than ever before in history.\nIn several of the larger cities the "fly\ning circus" of\' airplanes fought mimic\nbattles in the air high above the\nstreets. Secretary Glass is to deliver\nan address in Atlanta on May 1.\nChairmen all over the Southern\nstates are reporting that the Victory\nloan is easier to put over than they\nhad expected.\n"Our people have not lost their pa\ntriotism," they report. "There was\nan apparent apathy. We had begun\nto believe the public thought the war\nwas all over and there was no use in\nsubscribing to more bonds. But we\nwere wrong. The American--city man,\ntown man, farmer,-is willing to pay\nhis share of the war bill, and he is\nproving it."\nThat is the patriotio side of the mat\nter. On the business side, the short\nterm bonds or notes appear to strike\nthe public eye favorably. The average\nman is more willing to tie up hibi\nmoney for four years than for a long\ner period, and the, fact that the goV\nernment promises to pay in four years\nmakes the securities more easily ne\ngotiable at full price than if a period\nof twenty years were involved.\nThe quota for the district is $144,\n000,000. Several counties reported\narly on the first day that their quotas\nhad been reached, and asked for Vic\ntory Loan honor flags, which are to\nbe awarded to every community over\nt subscribing its share. The, fair and\nt square individual quota system adopt\ned by many counties hlped to carry\nthem over- the top on "Volunteer.\nS\'Days ,"the first tw" days of the -am -\nd paign. In the Third Loan campaign\nF. every county in the district yent over\n3. and an effort is being made to repeat\nd this performance this time.\nACT QUICKLY.\nDo the right thing at the right\ntime.\nAct quickly in time of danger.\nIn time of kidney danger, Doan\'s\nKidney Pills are most effective.\nPlenty of Donaldsonville evidence\nof their worth.\nMrs. Fran es Caficro, Lessard\nstreet, Donaldsonville, says: "I suf\nfered with intense pains through my\nkidneys. My back was so weak that\nI was unable to do any lifting; in\nfact, it was difficult for me to stoop\nover. My head ached, I felt nervous\nand languid, and my -lidneys -were\nout of order.
