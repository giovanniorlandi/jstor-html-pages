The story, Is laid in the Canadian Northwest,, and the building represents a com, bination hotel, gambllng-liouije and, dancehall that supplied all hie re, quirements of good shelter and, amusement for the lumber jacks., Most of the scenes of the play arc, enacted under this roof, and there, is little of the wild, outdoor life, usually associated with a Hart pic, ture. Instead of the familiar cow, punchers there is a motley crowd of, lumbermen and Indians, but it is, claimed that even in these unfamiliar, surroundings Hart loses not a whit, of his effectiveness, and in his new, setting gains in picturesquoncss., TOM MIX ON COWBOYS, AND MEN WORKING, ON THE BORDER., Tom Mix, the now William Fox, star who is the hero of the photo, play "Cupid\'s Round Up,” to he seen, at the Palace Sunday matinee and, Sunday night, ,is, from the great, Southwest. He has every respect, for any cowpunchcr that has roamed, the range anywhere but ho is a man, of the border country and he believes, that it has produced the greatest, cattle herders in the world., "The difference between the men of, the Southwest and those of the rest, of the great • range country,” said, Mix, “is that the men from Texas, and Arizona and New Mexico lived, on the edge of the country., “Sometimes, as you know, the, people just over the edge of the, southwestern states were pretty near, to being enemies. At any rate it, was mighty easy for the bad man, there to go from one country to, another., “This brought out a rather different, character than the Northwesterner, displayed. The Texas Ranuger was, a result of this condition I thins, border condition had the effect of, binding the American element in, the southwest closer together. But, a good cowpuncher is the same pret, ty much anywhere you find him, It is only the little differences that, lets me tell them apart.”, RICHES WITHOUT LOVE, A MOCKERY AS SHOWN, IN ‘‘RICH MAN, POOR MAN.”, Hit hes often prove a galling mock, ery when the possessor neither loves, nor 13 loved by some one. This, truth is examplified in “Rich Man,, Poor Man,” the superb Paramount, photoplay, starring Marguerite Clark,, known far and wide to screen pat, rons as "the sweetest girl In motion, pictures.”, “I regard the role of Betty Wynne,, which I portray in this really splen, did picture, as one of the best I, have ever done,” said Miss Clark to, an interviewer recently. "Betty is, a nice \'girl whose birth is enshrouded, In some mystery, and she finds her, self perfectly at home In the mansion, of a grouchy financier when she is, introduced as his grandchild through, jforged documents of which she is, [completely in ignorance., “Betty dissolves the Icles in the, old man’s heart and he learns to, love her deeply, so that when it de, velops that Betty isn’t his grand, daughter after all, he doesn’t want to, give her up. Of course, everything, ends happily,- and the development, of this attractive story, which is, based upon Maximilian Foster’s suc, cessful novel, Is responsible for, many situations of real dramatic, power. Frederick Warble plays the, part of the old financier in his usual, artistic manner.”, "Rich Man, Poor Man" will be, shown at the Coliseum Theatre to, night only, and Manager Cross pro, mises a most adequate presentation., COMING TO THE PALACE, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY AND, THURSDAY, A BIG PRODUCTION., Coming to tho I’ \' :rc Theatre for, Tuesday, Wednesd; md Thursday, is the biggest patriotic picture that, (he war has produced, “The Unbe, liever,” presented by George Kloine,, Tho story is one that carries a, wonderful patriotic appeal. The bru, tality of the Hun is startlingly pic, tured; the Marines are seen in ac, tion on the firing line. Your soul, will be stirred as it has never been, before, and your patrotic fever will, rise to a boiling point., The pivotal character of the story, is Philip Landicutt. a young man of, New York’s wealthy leisure class,, who is firmly entrenched behind, class pride, race prejudice, and un, belief of the God of Christianity, His virtues are passionate pity for, the oppressed, a fine sense of chiv, alry that cannot contemplate a, wrong unmoved, and the quick Felf, sacrifiee of youth. These redeeming, qualities sweep him into the chaos, of war. In tho white heat of stu, pendous happenings his soul is, cleansed and he emerges with the, love of humanity which is the very, essence of democracy., No one characterization makes, “the Unbeliever” one of best of the, many war films. It is the combina, tion of story, war pictures and at, mosphere that gives it such interest, The war scenes were filmed at the, United States Marine Corps canton, ment at Quanticn. under the direction, of a marine officer. Hundreds of, marines are in the drama., "The Unbeliever” is an adaptation, of “The Three Things,” a novel by, Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews, and was produced by Thomas A, Edison in conjunction with the United, States Marine Corps., Despite the increased cost of this, production, the Palace management, has decided not to increase the prior, of admission. This feature ran two, solid weeks at Jensen and Von Her, bergs’s Coliseum Theatre in Seattle, JUNE ELVIDGE FOR, LAST TIME TONIGHT, AT PALACE THEATRE., June Elvidge in "The Oldest Law", will be seen for the last time tonight, at the Palace Theatre, along with a, good comedy and Pathe Weekly.

Berger, So, cialist Congressman-Elect from Milwaukee who was, recently convicted for "conspiracy to wilfully cause, Insubordination, disloyalty and refusal of duty in the, military and naval forces in the service of the, United States,” and sentenced to twenty years \'in, the penitentiary. The letter is given out as Mr., Berger’s defense of himself., If Speaker Gillett had wanted any further rea, son than the proved, and admitted, acts of Mr, Berger, and his convection and sentence, to justifj, his action in refusing to permit the Socialist to, takg th^ol^a^ frgcS "as a $iemh#r of Congress,, Mr. Berger\'s lcttcf gifcs Tim the reason., Mr. Berger\'s conviction was based upon a ser, ies of editorials which he wrote and published’ in, his paper, the Milwaukee Leader, in which he, charged that the United States did not enter the, war for democracy, for Belgium, to prevent Germany, from becoming a menace to American institutions or, for any other worthy purpose, but to prevent Ger, many from achieving certain victory and thus cause, the depreciation of the value of the securities oi, Great Britain and the other Allies which "Big Busi, ness” had accepted in exchange for war supplies, to prevent the war from ending in Germany’s favor, quickly in order to aid the investors in war muni, tion manufacturing plants to continue making large, profits, to prevent laboring people from striking or, otherwise causing trouble, to make easier the pur, pose of foisting an absolute autocracy on the Ameri, can people in tho government of President Wilson,, to give an excuse for the establishment of a big, army in the United States which could be used, against the workingmen and serve as a market for, war supply makers, and to prevent Germany frotr, becoming commercially superior to Great Britain, and a rival of the United States. Another editorial, attacked the "draft” law, others said the war war, waged specifically and directly in the interest of, capital—that its object was profits, not democracy, In his letter Mr. Berger says in so many wordr, that he retracts nothing and stands by everything, that he said. Then he proceeds to make furthet, denunciations. He charges that the United Stater, is owned by plutocracy which has greater power here, than in any other place in the world, and he sayt, "nowhere in the world does it use this power so un, scrupulously.” lie asserts that "free speech" and a, free press” have been abolish in the United States, He reiterates that the war was fought for Morgan, and Company particularly and capitalists generally,, and that it was opposed by “every decent American.\', In other words, Mr. Berger’s words corroborate, what was proved at his trial, that he was for Ger, many and against the United States during the war,, and they prove that he still thinks Germany ought, to have been permitted to win the contest, and that, he was right in doing what he could to prevent the, United States from exercising her full strength to, win the war. Ills contention that he was convicted, because he was a Socialist is disproved by his argu, ment, in his own behalf., And to add hypocracy to the rest of his crimes,, Mr.-Berger concludes his letter by the statement, that he loves the United States. No sane man and, normal could possible love such a country as he, describes the United States to be., If this anti-American had not been arrested, con, victed and tjentenced to the penitentiary there would, have beep a miscarriage of justice, it would be dis, graceful-to permit him to have a scat in any law, making body of the.United States., BORAH\'S DEMAND, The sum and substance of Senator Borah\'s lat, est butburst Is that he wants the Republican party, to declare Its position on the league of Nations, but, he warns the party at the outset that he will never, abide by the decision unless it goes his way. He, speaks avowedly as a partisan, but violates a car, dinal rule of partisanship, which is that the parti, san shall fight any issue out in his party and abide, hy party* rule. In other words, he insists that the, issue - la such that every man must decide the ques-;, tion for himself alone, and yet lie wants the party, to decide., There is a general agreement on the proposition I, that the question whether this country shall go in, to the league or stay out is something that each Sen- ;, ator must decide for himself, and to the generality |, of minds—but not to Senator Borah\'s—this means, that the question is not a party question., What the Senator expects to gain by putting ;, his party officially on record we do not know, but, apparently underneath his excited exterior there is, a settled determination to run the Republican .party, or kick himself out of it, and he would like a de, cisive issue upon which to determine his course., Inasmuch as the war is over and the facts are wanted, for statistical and historical purposes, perhaps it, would be well for that war expenditure inquiry also, to include the Spanish War, the Civil War, the Mex, ican War, the War of IS 12 and the Revolutionary War., The United States won those wars also., The panic at Mannheim and elsewhere due to, the belief that the Germans are not going to sign, the peace treaty are straws that indicate an early, adjustment of the differences in Germany and the, acceptance of the treaty., Carranza says it is the aim of Mexico to treat all, people alike. This will set some people to wonder, ing what they ever did to Mexico., Hindenburg says he will noj write the memoirs of the, war. One can understand why he would even like to, forget the war., There is plenty or room outside of America for, the fellows who are not for America., School Teachers’ Salaries, (Ketchikan Times), No institution in any community Is of greater, importance than its schools. It might be said that, no part of our civilization compares in importance, to the public schools. It is there that the character, of America\'s citizens is developed. And the duty, of developing that character falls to the lot of the, teacher. Unknowingly the child mirrors the calibre, of the teacher as to character and oftentimes capa, bilities. It is therefore of the greatest importance, that teachers should be secured who stand high in, their profession., Teachers are very human, despite the expeeta, tiori of many that they should be demigods not sub, ject to the frailties of the genus homo. Like other, mortals they must look to their own interest, at least, in this time of the world and until we arrive at that, happy state of abnegation of self which many dream, ers believe we will ultimately reach. And the prin, cipal and most material way in which they must, look to their own interests is in the matter of sal, ary., Ketchikan has good schools today and capable, teachers. It is to the interest of the town to keep, them, for constant changing of teachers meajrs dis, ruption in the organization and loss to the pupil., But the town cannot hope to hold its teachers un, less it offers them a salary upon which they not, only may exist but upon which they may save a, sum sufficient to permit them to take special courses, every two or three years to keep them abreast of, their profession., Sulzer\'s Record, (Cordova Times), There has been a disposition evident to compare, the work in Congress of Mr. Sulzer with his prede, cessor, to the disparagement of the former. An un, prejudiced view, however, will reveal that Sulzer’s, work in behalf of the Territory during the year and, a half that he served in the House of Represents- ;, tivea was of the utmost importance, and brought out ,, qualities of diligence, far-sightedness and grasp ol [, public affairs which were in the nature of a sur, prise even to his friends. He was a hard worker, and I, there is little doubt that the fatigue and worry con, nected with the work of looking after the interest of, his constituents, taken in conjunction with the im, mense labor involved in fighting the contested elec, tion case, greatly weakened his already enfeebled, constitution and hastened the end., And in that contest case, brought face to face, with as arrant a lot of buncome and insincerity as, ever was laid before Congress, Delegate Sjilzer made, an enviable reputation. His straightforward, manly, address to the House in refutation of the absurd claim:, of his oppenent at once stamped him as a man of, marked ability and a conscientious public servant., The Territory of Alaska can ill afford to lost, such men as Charles A. Sulzer., Foreign Trade Healthy., (New York Commercial.), The United States exported $604,912,223 worth of, American-made goods in March, as compared with, $622,00,233 for the same month in 1918. At this, rate the United States will export more than the es, timated $7,000,000,000 this year—a remarkable show, ing, no matter how considered. It is true that prices, have gone sky-high, but the volume of business has |, also increased satisfactorily., The straw which shows the way the wind is blow, ing among our customers is the fact that the March,, 1919, total was $101,197,463. In March of last year i, it was $66,093,630.

Sulzer., and that they did so knowing they were not citizens, ol the Territory, or words of the same meaning., Unfortunately, for Mr. Wickersham, the greater ma, jority of the boys in khaki are Alaskans; raised here1, rr living here th¥ required time before volunteering |, or being drafted for service.

Some of these difficul, ties were set out in the very clear, address made by Superintendent, Ethel Jeans Cragg, and they wero, further outlined by President Grover, C. Winn of the School Board., To begin the year the board had, great difficulty in getting a corps of, teachers. Two or three times before, 1 the time set for the opening of, school a full staff of teachers was, secured and then it would go to, pieceis again through resignations, or other causes., Finally the school year was begun,, and then the superintendent left., Mrs. Cragg came to the assistance of, the School Board, took over the su, perintendent’s position, and with fine, executive ability and perseverance,, and the assistance of Mrs. H. I. Lu, cas, Mrs. W. J. Monahan and Mrs., J. Peters carried the work forward, to a successful conclusion. ,, But the troubles were not over., First the flood forced a vacation, Then twice came the suspension of, , school work as the result of the in, fluenza epidemic., Mrs. Cragg called attention to the, fact that two months of school work, were missed during the year. Yet., with the splendid co-operation of the, teaching stafT, the enthusiasm and, spirit of the pupils and the deter, mined efforts of all concerned all, handicaps were overcome, and Mrs., Cragg said she felt justified in say, ing from knowledge of the work, done that the graduation class being, sent out was one that would do, credit for the schools., President Winn, speaking for the, School Board, gave particular credit, for the work that had been per, formed In overcoming apparently un, surmountable obstacles was largely, due to Mrs. Cragg, and in token of, the appreciation of the School Board,, he presented her with a lovely gold, wrist watch., In accepting the watch, Mrs. Cragg, said she felt that the other teachers, were entitled to as much credit as, she was., CHAMPION CUP, Won from the Metlakatla Basket Ball Team ‘It B.
