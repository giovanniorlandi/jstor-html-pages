For a number of years, too, she\nWding the ranks of^ .business, though not ^^f^^%\nBut with the calling of the millions of men to the amy. ^eaUtasat\nZt come to woman to demonstrate that she is. as members of her sex hare\nlong contended, capable of shouldering the business load and bearing It\nheen considered "men\'s work." -Not such as clerking, bookkeeping and\niTforms of clerical work, -but hard labor, work that unt 1 lately it was\nnot thought that women were capable of performing. We see them on\npublic works of various kinds, in factories and work shops\nlately a great steel magnate was quoted os saying that he would not be\nsurprised if before long he had to take on a thousand women to take the\nplace of men drafted for the army.\nAnd to the credit of the women be it said that In the great majority\nof instances they aye making good. They are not only developing an\nability for work and business that a few years ago would, have surprised\nthe world, but they really appear to enjoy the work.\nThere may toe at the bottom of their success the long suppressed de-\nsire to show themselves Independent of man for a subsistence. If this be\nthe case they have reason to be.gratified, as they are fast becoming a\nrecognized factor in all the activities of life.\nBut, when the present emergency is past, will woman resume her old\nrftereo* semi-dejfcndent and nome bdy or will she hold tenaciously to\nwhat she has gamed and refuse to be ousted from her recently-won vant-\nage In case she should consent to resume her old- status, the world\nwould soon readjust itself and human life would continue to flow on as be-\nfore. But In the latter event, the entire" business fabric of the world will\nh*ve to be Temodeled and new adjustments and alignments made, The\naddition of a few million female workers, will work a great change in\nlabor conditionsa change that will call for careful handling.\nBut perhaps the most vital question in this connection is that, of Its\ninfluence on the homes or the land. The United States has arways been\npre-eminently a nation of homes. With us the home life has been en-\nthroned above every Other interest of life, and nothing was suffered to\nInterfere with its highest possible development. Will the home suffer in\nthe- years to come? Before the question of "the woman at work" is defin-\nitely solved, th^s one vital question will have to be answered, and on its.\nanswer hangs the destiny of a nation.\nINVESTIGATE THE P0STOFFICE DEPARTMENT\n(Washington, D. Herald)\nUnder the law, the most-powerful official in this country, next to the,\ncommander-in-chief of Its army and navy, Is the postmaster general. The\nofficial who can throttle or exterminate a free press is, finally, pretty\nnear the dictator of democracy and arbiter of all rights, to say nothing\nof his influence upon ordinary business and domestic affairs.\nIt is common knowledge that the PoBtoffice Department is badly\n"shot to pieces." It may be because Postmaster General Burleson has\nleaned too much towards making a profit. It may be because he has be-\ncome decidedly unpopular with his underpaid employes. It may be be-\ncause of hiB attitude toward labor and his suppression of papers with\nanti-administration or pro-German tendencies. However this may be, the\nsum total is unsatisfactory and bad condition.\nIt is highly important to speedily and thoroughly cure such a condi-\ntion In a time of war, when team work Is a prime essential. For instance?\nThe people are asked to help conserve transportation, through reduc-\ntion in passenger train Bervlce. Business men are asked to use the mails\ninstead of "sending a man" and they have a right to demand that gov-\nernment do its part iby providing first-class mall service. The Postofflce.\nDepartment has a record of over $5,000,000 profit, in one year, but, if\nbusiness concerns do conserve transportation as they ought, a poor mail\nBervlce may mean a loss of ten times that sum. And yet the right arm of\nall our,war preparation is-the ibusiness world, just now.\nSomewhere in the United States Senate archives is a resolution for\nInvestigation of the Postofflce Department. Such an investigation, to be\nconducted fairly-and thoroughly, ^s about the most important business\njthat the Senate haB on Its waiting list.\nTEE COAL SHORTAGE\nNow that the government has gotten the labor question pretty well\n{2\' In hand, and has virtually assumed control of railroad activities, it is to\n\'hz he hoped that the coal shortage can soon be remedied.\n_ The reason why the country has suffered a coal shortage is .simply\n-that the coal has not been mined. Many causes have worked to produce\n^7^-this result. Part of these lay with the operators and part with the men.\n5V "j gome mines labor disputes interrupted operations in others there\nseemed to be no-ambition to show a large output, but rather the reverse.\nThe truth of the coal situation, taking the country as a whole, is\nf&- --that there is plenty of coal in the m\'ines and plenty of men,.to get It out.\n,yy- the two are properly connected up there Is no valid reason why the\n^5%?"country should suffer from a lack of fuel.
