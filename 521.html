Her research focuses on the causes, treatment and prevention of suicide, the\npsychological mechanisms underlying suicide ideation, and the cognitive and social factors that influence\ndetection of suicide risk in others.\nThis book review is available in Numeracy: http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/numeracy/vol10/iss1/art10\n', 'In Numbers and Nerves: Information, Emotion, and Meaning in a World of Data, \neditors Paul and Scott Slovic, a psychologist and a professor of literature and \nenvironment respectively, bring together the work of scientists, journalists, \nnaturalists, activists, and artists, to demonstrate why we have trouble making \nsense of big numbers, how those big numbers have been presented effectively, \nand what we can do to overcome our limits and respond to big numbers more \nappropriately.  \nThe Slovics begin by expertly challenging the fundamental assumption that \npeople’s beliefs are internally consistent. They argue instead that our adherence to \nrules of logic and our understanding of numerical information used to describe \nbig, and sometimes catastrophic, problems are undermined by a type of thinking \nthat simplifies information processing and eases the burden of cognitive strain by \nallowing us to ignore or discount important evidence, especially numerical \nevidence. This habit of mind contributes to inaccurate judgments and bad \ndecisions. As Slovic and Slovic point out, ignoring or disregarding big numbers \ncan have calamitous results when we fail to act in the face of mass atrocities and \nenvironmental problems; for example, consider genocide, refugee crises, and \nglobal warming. This line of thought raises the question: How can we make sense \nof big data to minimize less-than-rational decisions and weaken their impact on \nthe sustainable wellbeing of people and the planet? The answer, according to the \nbook, can be found in connecting big data to personal stories and images that \nappeal to our emotions and strengthen our belief that we can make a difference.  \nIn Part I of the book, the editors set forth to expose the myth that people are \nentirely rational. A rational decision-making model predicts that people will rely \non logic, objectivity, analysis, and numerical data to make good decisions based \non an understanding of problems and opportunities. This model assumes that \npeople have full and perfect information about a problem, can identify criteria that \nwill be important to solving it, possess the necessary cognitive skills to \nunderstand a problem and its solutions, and have the time and resources required \nto make the best decision. It also assumes that a problem is unambiguous. If this \nmodel and its assumptions are correct, then people should be willing to donate as \nmuch money, if not more, to relieve suffering from starvation when they are told \nabout a starving child and also shown statistics about millions of others suffering \nfrom starvation than people who are only told about the single starving child; as \nthe author Annie Dillard, in her article “The Wreck of Time,” attributes to an \nEnglish journalist, “either life is always and in all circumstances sacred, or \nintrinsically of no account.” But research has shown that this thinking is not the \nnorm: people who are told about a single starving child and are presented with \nstatistics about starvation donate about half as much money as people who are \ntold only about the starving child, begging us to ask why. The answer is that \nrational decision-making models fail to take into account a type of fast and \n1\nKelly: The Power of Emotion: Review of "Numbers and Nerves" (2015)\nPublished by Scholar Commons, 2017\n', 'intuitive thinking that generates feelings and impressions and operates \nautomatically.  \nThis type of thinking can guide us through our daily lives efficiently with \nminimal need for the mind’s slower, analytical mode. But fast thinking is difficult \nto control and error-prone. Paul Slovic skillfully demonstrates this fact in a \ncreative and refreshingly simple experiment. He asked volunteers to imagine that \nthey were in charge of distributing funds for a charity. Would they give $10 \nmillion to fight a disease claiming 20,000 lives and save 10,000 or give $10 \nmillion to fight a disease claiming 290,000 lives and save 20,000? Volunteers \nresponded to the percentage of lives saved, choosing to save 10,000 lives, letting \n10,000 others die. Evidently, the cognitive tendencies underlying this type of notso-rational\nthinking can lead to bad judgments. These cognitive tendencies, \nincluding psychic numbing, pseudoinefficacy, and the prominence effect, are \npresented in Part I of the book.  \nThe editors of the book and its contributors use psychic numbing to explain \nwhy we fail to act appropriately to stop threats that have massive consequences. \nPsychic numbing creates a psychological distance from emotional experiences \nthat big numbers make even harder to comprehend; consider 800,000 to 1 million \nTutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the Rwandan genocide. It keeps \ncatastrophic problems from feeling real, allowing us to ignore them and continue \nas we always have.  \nA second tendency that deters us from intervening in large-scale social, \npolitical, economic and environmental problems is pseudoinefficacy, described in \nNumbers and Nerves as an illusion of ineffectiveness created in the face of big \nnumbers. Large numbers draw our attention to the people we cannot help, creating \nnegative feelings and diminishing the good feelings we get from helping those we \ncan.  \nThe third tendency that undermines the internal consistency of people’s \nbeliefs and values is the prominence effect. Prominent, or more important, \nattributes are weighted more heavily in decision making than attributes that \ncompete with our preferences. We end up choosing what is best depending on \nwhat feels most defensible. Borrowing an example from Numbers and Nerves, \naction to resolve humanitarian crises competes with our preference for security. \nBecause concerns for our security outweigh our concerns for nameless, faceless \nvictims, we opt for security and fail to intervene. But when volunteers are asked \nto quantify their values for both security and its competing objective, of \nintervening to prevent genocide, all before being asked to decide whether or not to \nintervene, they opt to intervene. The authors use this observation to advocate for \nvalues-focused thinking. This type of thinking would guide decision-making by \ngiving people an opportunity to identify and understand their values relevant to a \ndecision before making it.  \n2\nNumeracy, Vol. 10 [2017], Iss. 1, Art. 10\nhttp://scholarcommons.usf.edu/numeracy/vol10/iss1/art10\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1936-4660.10.1.10\n', 'This argument is particularly interesting because it hints at a slower and more \nanalytical, explicit type of thinking than the type of fast thinking we usually use. \nIt makes me wonder whether or not the decision to risk security to protect others \nafter quantifying values for competing objectives could also result from an \nimplicit memory effect called priming in which one stimulus influences a \nresponse to a subsequent stimulus. Could a simple prime prompt volunteers to \nconsider humanitarian intervention by activating associations in memory relevant \nto saving lives and preventing genocide?  \nI found a possible answer to this question later in Part II when Kristof writes, \nin his chapter, “The Power of One,” that people who are prepared to donate \nmoney to a charity, donate more when emotions are primed than people whose \nrational side is primed. This demonstrates the power of the priming effect and \nlends support to the idea that emotions influence the decision-making process and \nguide behavior. For Numbers and Nerves, creating an emotional connection to \nnumbers is how we turn big data into useable information. \nPart II of the book explores how we can build an emotional connection to \nvery large numbers using personal stories and images. “Portraits of Grief” is an \nunforgettable series of profiles revealing personal anecdotes and stories about \nmore than 1,800 victims of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. \nThese brief biographical entries use telling, personal details—an interesting \nhobby, a tattoo in middle age, a diasthema now seen in a grandchild—sketch for \nus a real person, a person who was loved. The series continued for months: a \nprocession more than a list.  \nConsider, too, a collection of photographs on display at the Kigali Memorial \nCenter: portraits of children slaughtered in the Rwandan genocide. The \nphotographs are very moving, more so because our normal context for snapshots \nof children is in albums we have kept of our own family. Maybe even more \nmoving are the placards in front of the portraits that share with us the child’s age, \nfavorite sport, favorite beverage, lots of other little details—and cause of death. \nTo know that each of these children had a beverage they preferred above all \nothers, and to learn that it was as unremarkable as Fanta or milk, impresses upon \nus something of the personality and the innocence of the child, taken so cruelly \nand unnecessarily, often “hacked by machete.”  \nThese examples illustrate the psychological power of storytelling and images \nto evoke our emotions by humanizing numbers, but I am not convinced that they \nreally change our understanding and handling of excessively large numbers. \nGetting a feel for what a huge number means is not easy, and Annie Dillard \nknows this when she wryly quips that there “are 1,198,500,000 people alive now \nin China. To get a feel for what that means, simply take yourself—in all your \nsingularity, importance, complexity, and love—and multiply by 1,198,500,000. \nSee? Nothing to it.” We have trouble grasping the enormity of big numbers; \n3\nKelly: The Power of Emotion: Review of "Numbers and Nerves" (2015)\nPublished by Scholar Commons, 2017\n', 'seeing numbers is just hard. One way the featured artists have tried to make \nnumerical information less abstract is to communicate numbers visually.  \nThe Tower of London poppy installation used 888,246 ceramic poppies to \nrepresent the number of British soldiers who died in World War I. The red \npoppies were placed in the moat area of the Tower over four months in 2014, \nmarking the centenary of Great Britain’s entry into World War I. The installation \nattempted to convey the magnitude of British loss of life in the war by way of a \nlarge and striking visual display.  \nAfter Part II’s descriptions of various media, Part III concerns itself with \nwriters and artists who use personal stories and images, along with numbers, to \nadvocate for change. These artists’ works attempt to make quantitative \ninformation meaningful and to override the psychological tendencies presented in \nPart I: psychic numbing, pseudoinefficacy, and the prominence effect.  \nPoet Homero Aridjis and his wife Betty are both active in combating \npollution in Mexico. In the interview, they speak about the importance of using \nnumbers to lend credibility to their arguments and of using stories to emphasize to \nthe Mexican people the impact of pollution on their personal lives. He believes \nthe comparison of concrete images helps us work around the sometimes vague \nabstraction of large numbers and thereby understand problems more fully. For \nexample, appreciating the meaning of 800,000 victims of the Rwandan genocide \nis hard, but can be made easier if we imagine the disappearance of an entire city \nthe size of Albany. The author and scientist Sandra Steingraber also focuses on \nusing personal stories along with numerical information. She believes that using \nthe big numbers which describe the scope of a problem is necessary, but that an \nessential first step is to make listeners receptive by connecting with relevant and \npersonal stories. \nAuthor and environmental activist Vandana Shiva, although also emphasizing \nthe importance of both story and number, sees them as different paths of \nargumentation, either of which can lead the listener to the desired goal of behavior \nor policy change—but each of which is best suited to one particular audience. For \nShiva, numbers can be a dull alternative to the excitement of an emotional \nresponse, but they can also thus be a most effective tool when working with \npolarized groups in which an emotional response is not as controllable.  \nEven when it is controllable, however, I doubt just how likely it is that \nemotions drive large-scale or permanent change. Indeed, many of the artists \ninterviewed speak of the frustration they feel with people’s unwillingness to either \nchange or even admit that they personally contribute to global problems despite \nboth emotional and numerical appeals. They put their personal comfort ahead of \nenvironmental and social considerations and use a post-hoc justification to defend \ntheir behavior, often within the framework of an us versus them mentality.  \n4\nNumeracy, Vol. 10 [2017], Iss. 1, Art. 10\nhttp://scholarcommons.usf.edu/numeracy/vol10/iss1/art10\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1936-4660.10.1.10\n', 'This thought makes me question the strength and depth of newfound \nconvictions which are achieved by means of emotional appeal among those who \nare willing to change—even when numerical data has been part of the message. \nIndeed, the comprehension of the numbers itself comes into question, and I \nwonder whether the numbers are in fact understood or are simply being used to \nprop up an opinion without much understanding. Could it be people tend to \nunderstand the credibility of numbers, but do not deeply understand the numbers \nthemselves? \nIf emotional engagement is in fact, as some of the artists argue, a necessary \nprerequisite to thinking seriously about numbers, then we must inform and edify \ncitizens accordingly. But if, on the contrary, emotions are yielding results too \nshallow, short-term, and unpredictable, perhaps we should all instead redouble \nour efforts to teach people how to think more deliberately, scientifically, and \nrationally. This type of thinking is harder and slower, and it is taxing to call upon \nthe part of our brain that deliberates and reasons. But, to twist a line from \nChesterton: convincing people by use of deliberation and reason has not been \ntried and found wanting; it has been found difficult, and left somewhat less than \nfully tried. \nNumbers and Nerves is a book worth reading, which well informs the reader \nof some of our most frustrating psychological limitations to responding \nadequately to large numerical data. These psychological mechanisms are \nexamined and demonstrated well in Part I. Although Parts II and III are more \ntentative, they do actively bring the reader into a conversation around what may \nvery well be the most important questions of our time: Why are we not \nresponding as we should to large numbers which quantify human suffering and \nenvironmental collapse? And how, then, might we work around these limitations? \nThis collection would serve as a fine introduction to the topic for undergraduates \nand educated readers of general interest. \n \n \n5\nKelly: The Power of Emotion: Review of "Numbers and Nerves" (2015)\nPublished by Scholar Commons, 2017\n']</pre>
