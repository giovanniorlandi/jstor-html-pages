Washington in The Inde\npendent.\nFrom time to time in the past a great deal\nof matter has been furnished to the public,\nwith the praiseworthy purpose of portray\ning the individual struggles and sacrifices\nof colored youths to secure an education.\nThese efforts of struggling young men and\nwomen, with no inspiration in family tradi\ntion and fortune, and with little or no money\nwith which to secure the knowledge they\ncrave, is one of the most encouraging as well\nas pathetic features I have come across in\nmy educational work during the past twen\nty years. As a hopeful indication of race\ncharacter, and I may safely so describe it,\nit must be of peculiar interest to the average\nAmerican interested in the Negro people.\nOn the other hand, much matter has also\nbeen furnished the public concerning the aid\ngiven the Negro race by philanthropic white\npeople; attention is also frequently directed\nto the volume of money expended for the\neducation of the Negro by state and munici\npal governments, the proceeds of land grant\nfunds and of common taaxtion.\nI do not think that the public has been\nsufficiently informed of what the Negro him\nself has been doing during the past forty\nyears, and is doing now, toward his own\neducation through the religious organiza\ntions controlled by him.\nBefore dwelling upon this principal point,\nhowever, I wish to direct attention here to\nseveral minor ways of more or less import\nance in which the Negro is constantly dis\nplaying the quality of self-help—the most\nimportant and significant force in the uplift\nof any person or race, the absence of which\nmust always be regarded as a fatal defect\nof character.\nFirst, then, it is well to say that there\nare very few orphan asylums anywhere for\nNegro children. Possibly in nine or ten\ncases Negro families care for the orphans of\ntheir race in the neighborhoods where they\nreside. A child is not left many hours with\nout parents before it strays into some fam\nily, or, more often, is sought out by some\nfriend, and, without legal formality, soon\nbecomes a real part of the family. Because\nof this custom one finds very little suffering\namong Negro children. In the Southern\nstates the masses know little about hospitals.\nThe sick and unfortunate are cared for by\nsecret and fraternal societies, by the churches\nor by individuals. A second form of self\nhelp, which is increasing year by year, is\nthe voluntary tataxion of Negro communi\nties for the purpose of extending the public\nschool term, often from one to three months;\nthat is, these months are added to the regu\nlar public school term.\nI could name other forms of self-help that\nare equally significant and praiseworthy.\nBut to return to the main point. Of the\nmore than eight millions of colored people\nin the United States, it is estimated that two\nthirds of the adults are members of some\nchurch. The great body of them are either\nmembers of the Baptist church, or of some\nbranch of the Methodist church. The Metho\ndists are divided into four groups or\nbranches, namely: the African Methodist\nEpiscopal, the A. M. E. Zion, the Colored\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nMethodist, and those belonging to the main\nbody of the Northern Methodist church. Be\nsides, in all the Southern states, and in some\nstates outside of the South, there are Presby\nterian, Congregational and Episcopal\nchurches, and a few other denominations —\nincluding Catholics—not under the Metho\ndist or Baptist groups, all contributing some\nthing toward the expenses of the schools and\ncolleges.\nThe plan for securing money from the col\nored people through their churches varies\naccording to the location and conditions sur\nrounding the people, as well as the customs\nand laws of the church. For example, in\nthe case of the Baptists, there is at least one\ninstitution, usually called college or univer\nsity, in each Southern state, supported in\npart or in whole by the pennies and dollars\nof the masses. In Alabama, for illustration,\nthere is what is known as the Alabama Bap\ntist Colored University, at Selma. Last\nyear the colored people in Alabama con\ntributed to the work of this institution\n$9,441.93, exclusive of student board and tu\nition. The property is owned by colored\npeople; their money created it, with the ex\nception of a few gifts from outside sources.\nThere is at least one such school in each of\nthe Southern states. The detailed circum\nstances surrounding them may vary, but the\ngeneral plan is the same.\nIn the ease of the African Methodist Epis\ncopal church, there are institutions that owe\ntheir existence almost wholly to the small\ngifts of the churches and individuals of the\ndenominations. Last year $51,601.86 was\nraised by the denomination for the purposes\nof education. The oldest and largest of these\ninstitutions is the Wilbeforce University, at\nWilbeforce, O. Although this institution is\nnow somewhat generously assisted by the\nstate of Ohio, it was for years supported\nalmost wholly by the colored people.\nLet me use another illustration as show\ning what the African Methodist Episcopal\nchurch is doing in the South. There is a\nschool at Atlanta, Ga., called Morris-Brown\nCollege, that was organized only a few years\nago. It now owns a very valuable property\nand has a large student body. The college\nwas built and is supported, to a large extent,\nby money raised by the church membership.\nFor 1904 the institution received from all\nsources for running expenses, $15,985.58, of\nwhich the churches in that connection in the\nstate of Georgia contributed $6,200, the\nthird Sunday in September being set apart\nfor the taking of offerings for the educa\ntional work; and $850.50 was raised through\nthe industrial department. The remainder\nwas contributed through other channels of\nthe church, and mostly all of it by Negro\npeople.\nThe African Methodist Episcopal Zion\nchurch has ten institutions of learning, of\nwhich Livingston College, at Salisbury, N.\nC, is the most important. The correspond\ning secretary of education of the Zion church\nreports that the money collected last year\namounted to $20,706.54, which went to all\nthe schools of the church to supplement their\nother revenues for running purposes.\nThrough the Freedmen\'s Aid and South\nern Education society of the Methodist Epis\ncopal church the colored membership con\ntributed for education for the current year,\n$19,251.73. For the ten years, 1896-1905, in\nclusive, $79,228.13 was contributed.\nFRIDAY, DEC. 8, 1905.\nAcme Publishing Co.\n214 COLUMBIA ST.\nBRIEFS\nour\nSpecia ty\nTelephones, 1306\nE. L.

M. E.\nchurch contributed $51,601.86 for education\nal purposes last year; the A. M. E. Zion\nchurch, $20,706.54; the Colored Methodist\nEpiscopal church, $45,000; the Methodist\nEpiscopal, $15,926.40; the Baptists, $85,\n--888.18, making the total, $218,622.98, for\nonly two branches of the Christian church.\nIf the contributions of the Negro Congrega-\ntionalists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians,\netc., be approximated, we should have prob\nably an annual contribution for educational\npurposes by the Negro Christians of $250,,\n--000.\nWithin the past ten years, it is safe to say,\naccording to these figures, that the Negro in\nAmerica has contributed at least $20,000,000\nthrough his churches toward his own educa\ntion. This, I think, all fair-minded people\nwill agree, is a pretty good record for a race\nof people which was in slavery forty years\nago. And these figures, of course, do not in\nclude the amounts which colored people are\ncontributing constantly to local and inde\npendent institutions.

Some time ago the Pie-maker made\nhis political pie say, things in connection\nwith the senatorial situation in this state,\nwhich, in view of subsequent developments,\nverged dangerously close to a genuine proph\necy, and the remarkable thing about the\n"subsequent development" is, the words\nused by the Pie-maker have been verified\nby one, who at the time was editor of the\nWalla Walla Union, and hated the Pie-maker\nfor publishing the story. He, since that time,\nhas fallen a victim to the Crocker-Baker-Ste\nvenson combine and he defends himself in\nan open letter which will be seen below.\nThat the readers of this paper may see how\nclose it was to the facts the Pie-maker\'s ar\nticle in its issue of November 24th, ult., is\nherewith reproduced. It seems that there\nis a row on in the Ankeny camp in Walla\nWalla, and Crocker and Baker demanded of\nAnkeny that Lorton be removed from the\neditorship of the Daily Union, and Ankeny\nbeing under the political influence of them,\ndid so immediately, and in doing so tried\nto make a scape-goat out of Lorton in order\nto hide the sins of others, which prompted\nLorton to defend himself in a stinging ar\nticle of rebuke, which verifies the Pie-maker\'s\nassertion that Crocker was the real candi\ndate for election to succeed Ankeny.\nFrom the Seattle Republican, November 24, 1905:\n"Do not be too sure, Mr. Pie-maker, that\nSenator Ankeny is going to spend as much\nmoney in his attempt to be re-elected as he\ndid in getting elected, for while Mr. Ankeny\noccasionally gets off of his whirl, yet he is\nkeeping a weather eye on the political situa\ntion in this state, and if he is not already\naware of the fact that while the political\nhenchmen of D. B. Crocker are ostensibly\nworking for Ankeny for senator to succeed\nhimself, yet in fact they are working for\nCrocker. For one of these fellows in an un\nguarded moment has already said: "In\npolitics Senator* Ankeny > too decrepit to\nbe returned to the Senate, and while it is\nthe intention of the bunch to make a bluff\nas supporting him, yet they really intend to\nsuport Crocker for the nomination, and\nthat he will be able to get all of Ankeny\'s\nstrength when it is seen that Ankeny\ncould not land." In politics Crocker is a\nfoxy granpa, and when you think him down\nand out he suddenly comes to the front a\nmost formidable opponent. At the last state\nconvention no one suspected that Crocker\nwas a candidate for the gubernatorial nom\nination, yet when everything seemed to be\nin the air he forged to the front and would\nhave been nominated with a hurrah had not\nthe Wilson contingent on the King county\ndelegation, and who, by the way, happened\nto be in the majority in the delegation, rose\na hundred strong and sent Piles word they\nwould not stand for Crocker, and if he of\nfered him on the convention floor for gover-\nnor they would revolt, which suddenly\nbrought the steering committee from King\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nto its senses and brought Crocker to defeat,\nThat he is going to give his friend Ankeny\nan awful tussle for the next election seems\nat this writing as certain as smoke is to go\nupward.\'\'\nFrom Lorton\'s Letter:\nAfter being sheared of its introductory re\nmarks, Editor Lorton goes at his subject as\nfollows:\n■\' Right in the beginning I wish to say that\nI am not in the least aggrieved because I\nhave severed my connection with The Daily\nUnion. On the other hand I regard this in\nthe light of relief and the termination of my\nconnection with that newspaper and the po\nlitical interests which it is published to con\nserve, in the light of my release from a po\nsition that was not only extremely exacting\nbut decidedly distasteful as well.\n"Regarding Councilman Glasford\'s con\nnection with the matter it is only an incident.\nI disclaim any ill feeling toward him. Any\nsatisfaction he may derive from my removal\nfrom the management of The Union he is\nmost welcome to. It is not a pique to me in\nany sense whatever. The Glasford matter\nwas only an incident in the program. Fur\nthermore every article that was published\nabout Mr. Glasford was submitted to the An\nkeny workers and passed upon by them,\ncounseled and advised by the very men who\nhave maintained the party organization and\nhave done the most to keep it together and\nwin victories for the organization.\n"However, this has had very little to do\nwith my resignation from the editorship and\nmanagement of The Union. The truth is that\nthere was no question in the minds of the\nbest informed lawyers in the city that the\ncase would easily be won if not thrown out\nof the courts, but the threat was made that\nif the case came to trial, evidence would be\nintroduced that would reflect upon Senator\nAnkeny in connection with the part of his\nprivate secretary, A. F. Statter, is alleged\nto have taken."\n"This information is positive and to the\npoint and it was confirmed by a number of\nSenator Ankeny\'s closest and best friends\nweeks before his departure for Washington,\nso that he could have taken such action as\nhe deemed necessary to protect his name by\nthe removal of Mr. Statter had he deemed\nsuch action necessary.\n"He and his friends can reconcile as best\nthey can what ends of justice or fairness\nhave been conserved by making me bear the\nburden of Statter\'s misdeeds if he is guilty,\nand if he is not, what was the use of making\na scape-goat out of any one. I have for\nmonths endeavored to shield Senator An\nkeny from the odium and I here and now\ncharge that he has full knowledge of it, and\nif he is still in doubt as to its truth he puts\nthe stamp of falsehood upon some of the best\npolitical friends he ever had.\nGraft Money Raised.\n"The fact is, if Mr. Statter did not par\nticipate in the funds collected from the gam\nblers of Walla Walla during last summer he\n* * * had full knowledge of the affair."\n"I am violating no confidence," says the\ndeposed editor, "in speaking plainly upon\nFRIDAY, DEC. 8, 1905.\nthis subject, but am merely presenting my\nside of the case concerning which the public\nhas a right to know. I feel that an infamous\nwrong has been comitted against me by men\nwhose duty by all the laws of honor and de\ncency should have been to stand by me, and\nsince they slink away in the darkness and\nseek to hide behind a miserable falsehood, I\nam doing what I have a perfect right to do,\nand that is, tell the exact truth.\n\'•Neither Senator Ankeny nor A. R. Bur\nford, his personal representative, acted upon\ntheir own initiative or in accordance with\ntheir own wishes in the matter, and I wish\nhere to publicly express my thanks for the\nconsideration shown me by the latter. For\nalmost a year B. D. Crocker, Railroad Lobby\nist George Stevenson and United States Mar\nshal George Baker have been causing the in\nformation to be spread over the state that I\nwas to be removed from the managing editor\nship of The Union.\nThree Men Own Ankeny.\n"These three men own Senator Ankeny\npolitically, body and soul. If he should ever\nhave the courage to run counter to their\nwishes they would immediately combine to\nwreak their vengeance upon him, and there\nis good reason to believe they have already\nset in motion plans for his retirement from\nthe Senate at the expiration of his present\nterm and the election of either Crocker or\nBaker in his place. But in the meantime he\nwill be led to believe that they are working\nfor his interests and success in order to in\nduce him to supply the expenses which they\nwill have to incur in the absence of better\nqualities which ought to go to make up a\nsuccessful senatorial campaign.\n"So far as these three political buccaneers\nare concerned I have for them the supremest •\ncontempt. I believe they are capable of any\ninfamy to accomplish their ends; that Crock\ner, who is the leader, would stoop to anything\nto accomplish his designs; that he has been\nknown to hire thugs to attend primary cau\ncuses to intimidate honest voters who would\nhave been struck down by a signal from him;\nthat his word is not good in politics; that he\nwould sacrifice friendship, honor, everything,\nto gain his ends.

REED.\nMayor-Elect of North Yakima.', 'FRIDAY, DEC. 8, 1905.\n"I could not possibly wish Senator Ankeny\nany greater misfortune in politics than to\nhave as his advisers and counselors such men\nas Crocker, Stevenson and Baker, with their\nlocal satillites, Dr. Y. C. Blalock and 0. T.\nCornwall. Very respectfully,\n"EUGENE LORTON."\nState Senator Walter J. Reed was elected\nmayor of North Yakima last Tuesday on\na "retrenchment" ticket. There probably\nis not a more popular man in all Central\nWashington than Mr. Reed, and his friends\nall over the state will rejoice to hear of his\nrecent popularity. In the last legislature\nSenator Reed won much fame as a legisla\ntor and as mayor of the most prosperous\nburg in Central Washington it is here pre\ndicted that he will prove a most brilliant suc\ncess. For four years he was register of the\nU. S. land office in North Yakima, where\nhe achieved much fame for fairness and\nhaving been elected mayor of North Yakima\non a retrenchment ticket the voters need\nhave no fear but that he will carry out\ntheir expressed wishes to the letter.\nWhile there is not the. slightest doubt but\nthat Hiram C. Gill will be unanimously nom\ninated to succeed himself and subsequently\nbe elected, yet nothing would .so completely .\nsettle the whole proceeding in his favor than\nfor the Democrats to nominate" Rev. M. A.\nMathews as his\' opponent. The Seattle Re\npublican truly hopes Rev. Mathews will ac\ncept the nomination to oppose Mr. Gill and,,\nif he does not hear a el^p of thunder from a\nclear sky then our pen will forget its cun\nning and our thoughts cleave to the top of\nour cranium.\nA preacher, at the conclusion of one of his\nsermons, said:" "Bet all in the house who\nare paying their debts, stand up." In\nstantly every man, woman and child, with\none exception, rose to their feet. The\npreacher seated them and said: "Now, every\nman not \'payin^ifr :deb& stand up." The\nexception noted a careworn, hungry looking\nindividual,\' clothed in his last summer\'s\nsuit, slowly assume a perpendicular position.\n"How is it, my friend," asked the min\nister, "that you are the only man not to\nmeet his obligations?" "I run a newspa\nper," he meekly answered, "and the breth\nren\'who stood up here are all my subscribers,\nan( j.

One point, and one point only, did\nthe Gazette make and cinch, and that was\nfound in the second line of its tirade (it\nwould be unprofessional to call it an article)\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nwhere it picturesquely describes the nation\nality of the editors of The Seattle Repub\nlican, and that point has been so generally\naired by other papers of the state that had\noccasion to differ ,\'from The Seattle Repub\nlican that every man, woman and child with\naverage intelligence more than knew that\nthe editors in question are Negroes. In the\nthird line the Gazette misspelled the name of\nthe editor, thus leading its readers, "if it\nhas any, to understand that the editor and\nthe associate editor are not Mr. and Mrs.\nH. R. Cayton. From that very line to the\nend of the tirade every line was but a greater\nerror than the first. It was fraught with ty\npographical mistakes, faulty in "orthogra\nphy, syntax and prosedy" and in short re\nminded one of a great gas bag puffed all\nout, but when punctuated only smelt bad.\nWhat really is the matter with the Ga\nzette is, it is one of the Ankeny subsidized\norgans, and it took exceptions to an article\nin The Seattle Republican pointing out that,\nSenator Ankeny would not get a single vote\nfrom Whitman County when he is up for re\nelection, and not daring to editorially dis\npute the allegations therein and feeling that,\nit would burst wide open unless it damned\nsome one one account of the appearance of\nthe article it picked up the Canutt sketch,\nwhich it had to admit was so cleverly writ\nten that it was without fault, and began a\nbit of rather despicable mud slinging, wholly\nuncalled for. Whenever a newspaper man\nor a public speaker is lacking in either real\nability to answer an opponent or has no re\nbuttal facts, it\'s an old trick to begin to\nsling mud. If The Republican exaggerated\nin Mr. Canutt\'s biographical sketch, point it\nout, and if you are not educationally able ,to\nPRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT\nSends Another of His Characteristic Messages to\nCongress.\ndo so, then we suggest you appeal to some\none "of the genus Africus" to doyj^for you.\n"Open confessions," we have Isten taught\nby the Good Book, "are good for the soul."\nNow admit that you have bitten off more\nthan you can chew, or, more frankly speak\ning, that you are a "pons-assnorum," andaie\nthat for the money that\'s in it, dished out\nto you by the Levi Ankeny bunch there\nabouts with one rather odd looking Piekerell\nas chief dispenser.\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt sent another\nof his characteristic messages to Congress\nlast Tuesday, which was remarkable for a\nnumber of things. First of all for its great\nlength -and secondly for its frankness in\ndealing with the great questions that are dis\nturbing the body politic of this country at\nthe present time. Railroad regulation he\ninsisted must be taken up and satisfactorily\ndisposed of or public ownership will be\nforced on the country, and to that end he\nleaves the matter with the railroad attor\nneys who have been sent to the United\nStates Senate to look after railroad interest.\n# # #\nA Cleveland genius soberly claims that he\nhas invented a wireless trolley that will run\nstreet cars and other vehicles on the same\nprinciple that wireless telegraphy is operat\ned. Impractical as the invention may appear,\nit seems no more so than did the telegraph,\nthe telephone and other wonderful modern\ninventions, for it seems as though wonders\nwere never to cease. The inventor of the\nwireless trolley admits, however, that there\nare still some difficulties to overcome before\nhis device will be perfect, but declares that\nthey will be eventially removed. —Ex.', 'SEATTLE\'S BOND ISSUE.\nNow that the school election is a thing of the\npast, the Seattle property owners should give some\nconsideration to the election that will be held in this\ncity December 28th, which will vote whether or not\nthe city shall issue $500,000 bonds to purchase ad\nditional lands for park purposes. Before we had\ngiven this subject careful study it occurred to us\nthat we would be doing the taxpayers, and espe\ncially the small taxpayers, a great favor by opposing\nthe bond issue, but after making considerable in\nquiry we are free to confess we would be doing the\nlatter class of taxpayers an injustice should we op\npose the bond issue.\nA number of the largest taxpayers of the city have\nbeen consulted on the subject, and they are unani\nmously in favor of it. Now the burden of the tax\nwill be borne by those men while the small taxpayer\nwith only a home will not pay 10 per cent of the\nwhole. The men who will pay the great bulk of this\nspecial tax will seldom, if ever, visit those parks for\nrecreation; but the men who will pay only the 10\nper cent, accompanied by their families, will get the\nfull benefit from a recreation standpoint. If, then,\nthe small taxpayer votes against the measure he will\nbe cutting off his nose to spite his face. The big\ntaxpayer wants the parks because they will make\nthe city more attractive and enhance the value of\neverybody\'s property, and they will be benefited in\ndirectly.\nThere is no denying the fact that the parks are\npatronized for recreation purposes almost ex-\nThe Jewelry Section Shows a Wonderful Variety of Handsome Presents\nManicure and Toilet Set Novelties\nIfeft*iiiiilr 1^ At $1,75 Fine Manicure Set, containing nail\n■h"«h™\' .. . i * file, scissors, cuticle knife, powder\n» . ,r Fine Toilet Set, containing a good At Og c Gentlemen\'s Collar and Cuff Boxes, box and polisher, with either cocobola, stag or ivory\nAt ODC comb and brush, with line bristles, va- \' made from good quality imitation backs; put up in a neat leather box.\nriety of ebony and cocobola backs, with silver mount- seal leather in black, brown and dark green, also\nings, put up in a neat box, suitable for Christmas " fancy metal compartment on lid for collar buttons. j^fiSl fc^.\npresent.

There\nis still no denying the fact that the wealthier citi\nzens will pay almost all of the taxes to pay the\n$500,000 bond issue, and yet every one of them is\nanxious for the opportunity to do so. In view of\nthese facts it would seem utterly foolish on the part\nof the poor to stand in the way of the more wealthy\nto prevent the latter from spending their money\nfor the comfort and happiness of the former. If the\nmore wealthy citizens were opposing the measure\nwe know of no bettJSfcway for the poorer citizens\nto make them expenjklbme of their* wealth for the\nlatter\'s benefit than for the poorer folk to vote for\nthis bond issue.\nIf, therefore, you have not registered this year,\nwhich would entitle you to vote for those bonds on\nDecember 28th, you should lose no time in register\ning, and be sure to vote on the appointed day for\nthe bonds. If you are only the owner of a home the\ntaxes you would have to pay on that bond issue\nwould not exceed one dollar, and for that you and\nyour fellow citizens would be the recipients of one of\nthe finest park systems in the country. There is\nneed of more park ground; there is more need of\nmore play grounds in Seattle, and the men who have\nthe money are willing to dig up for it if you will\nonly let them do so.

She has played\nthe Salvation Army lassie in "The\nBelle of New York" in Australia, South\nAfrica and England. She was engaged\nby the management of the Drury Lane\nTheatre in London as principal "boy"\nin the mammoth Holiday spectacles\nproduced there. All London hailed\nher in the role of "Dick Whittington"\nas the best "boy" ever seen in that\nfamous old theatre. She even played\nthe part of "Humpty Dumpty" in the\nDrury Lane production of that panto\nmime, being the only woman who ever\nessayed that role.

It is advertised as Zinn\'s Trav\nesty Company, well that is what it is,\na travesty on the amusements of the\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nday. It might as well be called "Furi\non the Trail" as anything else, and it\nmight have all happened there any\nnight after the regular performance,\nfor such scenes are not uncommon in\nlarge cities, and they are not so much\nexaggerated after all. All an ingenious\nmind has to do is to group together\nthe funny things seen, individuals and\nincidents, that he can encounter in a\nfew days or some times a few hours in\nany large city. There is an abundance\nof real wholesome fun in the show at\nthe Third Avenue Theatre this week.\nThere is lots to laugh at, and the\nlaughs are well earned—no fault could\nbe found with any feature in the show,\nfor it is clean, harmless and musical.\nYou won\'t be much wiser for having\nseen it, but you will feel better.\nA prominent dramatic critic, review\ning the successes and failures of this\nseason, in a late number of a popular\nmagazine makes the following state\nment: "It is not the manager who\nchanges his play each year that makes\nmoney. The successful manager is\nthe one who takes one good play, sticks\nto it, endeavors to build it up, and\neach year offers it to the public in bet\nter shape than before." This was Fred\nRaymond\'s idea ten years ago when\nhe first introduced "The Missouri\nGirl." Each year the play has been\nimproved and twice re-written, and\nnow Mr. Raymond has the satisfaction\nof knowing that he has one of the\nbest money-making attractions on the\nroad, and "The Greatest Domestic\nComedy of the Age." One perform\nance of "The Missouri Girl" will be\ngiven at the Third Avenue theatre all\nnext week, starting with a matinee\nSunday.\nPERSONAL.\nThe home of Mr. and Mrs. H.
