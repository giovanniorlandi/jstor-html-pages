A strong northeast\nwind which has blown since Friday has\nheld back the water and allowed the\nIce to gain a foothold. Two employes\nof the American reservation walked\nfrom Prospect Point nearly to Bath\nIsland Sunday morning. They desist\ned from completing the trip merely\nbecause they did not care to get their\nfeet wet, a stream at one point being\na few Inches above the tops of their\nboots.\nA great wall of Ice runs from the\nhead of Goat Island to the American\nmainland,, through which only tiny\nstreams are able to trickle. This\nwall has even . encroached on the\nCanadian channel, extending out some\n200 feet beyond the Third Sister Island\nend greatly diminishing the flow over\nthe Horseshoe. Only the very apex\nof the Canadian falls Is left and that\nIs robbed of half its flow.\nThe gorge below is choked and the\nrapids have lost their fury, while the\nwhirlpool is barely in motion.\nThis Is only the third time that this\ncombination of ice and wind has thus\naffected the falls since the white man\ncame here.

It every family\nwere brought to an Intelligent realiza\ntion of tbe need of isolation of a patient\nIn any case of preventable disease-or in\nother words the rigid separation of the\nsick from tbe well-there would be no\nschool Infection. Every school epidemlo\nbegins in some b me where the effi\nciency and justice of quarantine la either\nnot understood or else tbe family wil\nfully allows the Infection to be brought\nInto tbe school. The school thus becomes\ntbe disseminator ol disease to the entire\ncommunity. The people must be edu\ncated In the great study of modern medi\ncine, prevention. As long as there ex\nists ignorance, neglect or carelessness in\nregard to these well recognized prevent\native ineasures-so long will we be una\nble to limit spread of in lection and Boards\nof Health will be impotent to effect tbe\ngeneral spread of preventable disease.\nNotice to the Public.\nOur attention ha been called to a no\ntice published by tbe County Com in Is-\nsioi era elation that the Auditors\' report\nfor tbe year 1909 was Incorrect, In tbat it\nshows a balance in favor of tbe County of\n$11,846 25, while in reality It should show\nbut $7,161.98.\nTbe Auditors\' report is correct. The\ndiscrepancy in qnestiou is due to tbn fact\nthat the Commls loners omitted $4,184 27\noutstanding liabilities from their finan\ncial statement.\nThe liabilities in question have not yet\nbeen before the Auditors, but remain in\ntbe Commissioners\' office In the shape of\nunpaid bills.\nTbe action of the Commissioners In\nrushing into print In this matter was, In\nour opinion, III considered. If such a\nstatement is to be published it should set\nforth the facts so that the blame might be\nplaced upon tbe right parties.\nWe hope tbe Commissioners will have\ntbe fairness to explain their statement\nand say to tbe public that the blame be\nlongs, not to the Auditors, but to them\nselves.
