Was this analysis correct?”\nSouth Korea: Anatomy of a Crisis\nH a-Jo o n  C h a n g\nT\nhe South Korean economy contracted by 5.3 \npercent in  the first half of 1998. Unemploy\xad\nment is up from 2.5 percent in mid-1997 to \n7.6 percent in August 1998—a level not seen in \nSouth Korea for more than 3 decades—and is \nexpected to rise to around 10 percent by the end of \nthis year.\nAt the same time, there has been a record drop \nin productive capacity utilization, from 81 percent \nin mid-1997 to 63.7 percent as of mid-1998, a drop \nthat reflects the plummeting demand and credit \ncrunch South Korean firms face. Although foreign \ncurrency reserves have increased from $8.9 billion \non the eve of the crisis in early fall of 1997 to more \nthan $40 billion, this growth is almost totally due \nto the collapse in imports (which in turn is largely \nthe result of the fall in investment) rather than a \nrise in exports. Despite the earlier predictions of a \nquick export-led recovery following the $57 billion \nIMF package agreed to in November 1997, exports \nfell between May and August, and the country is \nbracing for the first year-on-year fall in exports \nsince 1958. Given the continuing turmoil in the \ninternational financial market, whatever little \nprospect there was for an early recovery in South \nKorea seems to be quickly receding.\nH a-Jo o n  C h a n g  is a professor of economics in the faculty of \neconomics and politics at Cambridge University. He is the \nauthor of The Political Economy of Industrial Policy (New \nYork: St. Martin’s, 1994), and coeditor with Boh Rowthom of \nThe Role of the State in Economic Change (Oxford: Oxford \nUniversity Press, 1995). This article draws on “Korea: The Mis\xad\nunderstood Crisis,” World Development, August 1998, and \n“Interpreting the Korean Crisiscoauthored with Hong-Jae \nPark and Chul Gyue Yoo, Cambridge Journal of Economics, \nNovember 1998.\nHow did South Korea, once a symbol of indus\xad\ntrial dynamism and relentless growth, find itself in \nsuch a critical situation?\nThe nature of the problem\nMany commentators initially claimed that South \nKorea’s economic travails were proof that the coun\xad\ntry’s inherendy inefficient and corrupt state-led eco\xad\nnomic system had finally reached its limits. The \nmedicine to cure the country’s economic ills, they \nargued, was to ditch the defunct state-directed eco\xad\nnomic system and create in its place a ‘genuine’ \nmarket economy in the Anglo-American mold \nthrough the extensive liberalization of finance, \ninternational trade, and the labor market. Was this \nanalysis correct?\nThe South Korean crisis is essentially a financial \ncrisis rather than one created by the “real econ\xad\nomy”—although a severe financial crisis can easily \nturn into a crisis of the real economy, as has hap\xad\npened in South Korea and other Asian countries \nduring the last several months.\nMost of South Korea’s manufaemring firms make \nproducts that sell in even the most demanding mar\xad\nkets—if the exchange rate is right (a point to which \nwe will return). In the two years before the crisis, \nthe won, the Korean currency, was overvalued prob\xad\nably by about 1 0  percent, but even then, on the eve \nof the crisis, the current account deficit was just \nover 3 percent of g d p . Yet Thailand, Malaysia, and \nMexico had current account deficits equivalent to \n8  to 1 0  percent of g d p  before their recent crises, and \nin previous downturns, such as that of 1980, South \nKorea had current account deficits approaching 9 \npercent of g d p . Furthermore, most foreign loans \nfinanced investments in export sectors rather than\n437\n', '438 • CURRENT HISTORY • December 1998\nreal estate development or imports of consumer \ngoods, as was the case in Mexico and Southeast \nAsia. The South Korean budget had been largely in \nbalance and gross public debt amounted to only 3 \npercent of g d p  in 1997; the influential British jour\xad\nnalist Martin Wolf of the Financial Times described \nit as “the second best budgetary position in the \nwhole of the OECD [Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development]\nIf the real economy in South Korea was relatively \nsound, what were the causes behind the crisis?\nThe immediate causes\nThe first obvious suspect is the accumulation of \nnonperforming loans in the domestic banking sys\xad\ntem, which is an indication of how poorly invest\xad\nment decisions had been made, allegedly under \nmisdirected government industrial policy.\nThroughout 1997, nonperforming loans as a \nshare of total loans increased from 4.1 percent (at \nthe end of 1996) to 6.8 percent (in September \n1997). This may sound high, but it is not especially \nso for South Korea; the share of nonperforming \nloans was 7.5 percent in 1990 and 7 percent in \n1993, for example. In other words, nothing in the \nstatistics on nonperforming loans in the domestic \nbanking system suggested that the country would \nsoon face a crisis.\nWhat about the foreign debt? After all, wasn’t the \nSouth Korean crisis a debt crisis?\nSouth Korea’s foreign borrowing did increase \nquickly in the few years leading up to the crisis. \nForeign debt nearly tripled, from $43.9 billion in \n1993 to $117.3 billion in June 1997. This translates \ninto a foreign debt growth rate of 33.6 percent per \nyear, which is almost two times faster than the for\xad\neign debt growth rate between 1979 and 1985 \n(when South Korea was the fourth-largest interna\xad\ntional debtor after Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina \nbut, unlike these countries, avoided a debt crisis).\nAlthough South Korea’s foreign debt growth was \nfast, the overall debt was not at an obviously unsus\xad\ntainable level. The World Bank defines a country as \n“heavily indebted” when its foreign debt-to-GNP \nratio exceeds 48 percent, but the South Korean ratio \nin 1996 was only 22 percent; corresponding figures \nat the end of 1995 were 70 percent for Mexico, 57 \npercent for Indonesia, 35 percent for Thailand, 33 \npercent for Argentina, and 24 percent for Brazil.\nAnother common indicator of foreign debt bur\xad\nden is the debt-service ratio (interest payments as a \npercentage of total exports). South Korea’s debt- \nservice ratio, at 5.4 percent in 1995 and 5.8 percent\nin 1996, fell well below the World Bank “warning” \nthreshold of 18 percent. This figure also compares \nfavorably with Mexico (24.2 percent), Brazil (37.9 \npercent), Indonesia (30.9 percent), and Thailand \n(10.2 percent) in 1995. Moreover, most of the debt \nbuildup occurred between 1993 and 1996, and by \nmid-1997 the growth in debt was already slowing \nto an annualized growth rate of 19 percent.\nAlthough the overall debt level was not high, and \nalthough its growth was slowing, one element of \nSouth Korea’s foreign debt was seriously askew: the \nhigh proportion of debts with very short maturity. \nThe share of short-term debt (debt with less than a \nyear’s maturity) as a percentage of total debt rose \nfrom an already high 43.7 percent in 1993 to a stag\xad\ngering 58.2 percent at the end of 1996. However, \neven here, the share of South Korea’s short-term \ndebt actually fell marginally, from 58.2 percent at the \nend of 1996 to 58 percent at the end of June 1997.\nThus, the South Korean foreign debt situation \nwas already almost as bad at the end of 1996 as it \nwas on the eve of the crisis, so it is difficult to con\xad\nclude that this was what sparked the crisis. W hat \nwe need to introduce is the element that shook the \nconfidence foreign lenders had in the economy and \nmade them suddenly withdraw their loans. This \nbrings us to two high-profile corporate bankrupt\xad\ncies: the collapse of Hanbo Steel in early 1997 and \nKia Automobile in mid-1997.\nIn January 1997, a new major steel company, \nHanbo, went bankrupt, revealing a web of corrup\xad\ntion involving bank loan decisions that included \nsome close aides of then-President Kim Young Sam \nand in all probability his son (although he was \nnever officially charged). This scandal was, despite \nthe popular conception, not typical of what was \noccurring in the country before Kim had become \npresident in 1993. It is by now well known that the \nSouth Korean state had always exacted large sums \nof money from big business (a fact revealed in the \ncorruption trials of the two former presidents, Gen\xad\nerals Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo), but these \nexactions were mainly in the form of general polit\xad\nical funding or bribes and kickbacks in areas such \nas defense contracts and urban planning. There \nwere very few cases in which bribes were directly \nrelated to the licensing of and the supports (subsi\xad\ndies, trade protection) for particular projects in the \nmain manufacturing industries, which were usually \nsubject to national and sectoral government plan\xad\nning. The Hanbo scandal was the first revelation \nthat, under Kim, corruption had spilled into major \nmanufacturing industries.\n', 'South Korea: Anatomy of a Crisis • 439\nShocking as the Hanbo scandal was, what really \nbattered foreign confidence in the South Korean \neconomy was the collapse of Kia, the third-largest \ncar manufacturer in the country, belonging to the \neighth-largest chaebol, or conglomerate. When Kia \nfirst showed signs of major trouble in  mid-1997, \nFinance Minister Kang Kyong Sik argued that South \nKorea required more market principles and that he \nwas therefore willing to let Kia go bankrupt (as if \nno chaebol had gone bankrupt before). Given his \nand President Kim’s well-known connections with \nSamsung, many people interpreted this as a coded \nmessage that he would let Kia be taken over by \nSamsung, whose new auto venture was looking \nincreasingly doubtful without the acquisition of an \nexisting firm with solid manufacturing capabilities.\nHowever, given this political back\xad\nground, the possibility of a takeover of \nKia by Samsung did not go over well \nwith the public. Faced with this, the Kim \ngovernment changed its policies about \nthe fate of Kia m any  times, u n d erm in in g  \ninternational confidence in its capacity \nto manage the economy, until it eventu\xad\nally nationalized the company (although \nit was being sold to Hyundai in the fall \nof 1998).\nThese events were unfolding at an \nunfortunate time: the breakout of the \nSoutheast Asian crisis, which had a num\xad\nber of effects on the South Korean economy. First, \nbecause of the so-called contagion effect, being an \nAsian country suddenly became a liability, which in \npractical terms meant that foreign lenders were now \nmuch less willing to roll over South Korean debts. \nThe Southeast Asian crisis also meant a fall in \nexports and a collapse in overseas construction \norders. It is also believed that many South Korean \nfinancial institutions lost money in the bursting of \nthe speculative bubbles in Southeast Asia—as much \nas $2 billion to $3 billion, possibly more.\nWhere policy went wrong\nBehind these immediate causes of the South \nKorean crisis lay a series of policy failures that were \nthe result of a poorly designed liberalization pro\xad\ngram that had been implemented by the Kim Young \nSam government after it took office.\nThe liberalization of the financial sector created \nSouth Korea’s investment boom of the mid-1990s, \nwhich was the main cause of the country’s debt \nbuildup. The program included interest rate dereg\xad\nulation, abolition of “policy loans” (governmentdirected\ncredit), granting of more managerial auton\xad\nomy to the banks, reduction of entry barriers to \nfinancial activities, and most important, substantial \n(if not total) capital account liberalization. With the \ndrastic relaxation of regulations regarding foreign \nborrowing, especially short-term borrowing, South \nKorean banks and financial institutions, notably the \ncountry’s 30 merchant banks (24 of which were set \nup after 1994), engaged in rapid, massive foreign \nborrowing.\nThe South Korean currency had been overvalued \nat least since 1995, which was reflected in the coun\xad\ntry’s current account balances. The current account \nsurplus of $0.4 billion in 1993 turned into deficits \nof $4.5 billion in 1994, $8.9 billion in 1995, and a \nrecord $23.7 billion in 1996 (equivalent to more \nthan 5 percent of g d p ) ,  although it fell to \napproximately $12.5 billion by Novem\xad\nber 1997, just before the crisis.\nAgain, current account deficits of this \nsize were not the worst South Korea had \nseen; as was noted, in 1980 the current \naccount deficit was equivalent to about \n9 percent of g d p . But in the more recent \nperiod, the current account deficit was \n$8.7 billion in 1991, which as a propor\xad\ntion of g d p  was larger than the $8.9 bil\xad\nlion of 1995 (3 percent versus 2 percent, \nrespectively). However, the 1991 deficit \nquickly fell to $4.5 billion in 1992 and \nthen turned into a small surplus in 1993, whereas \nthe 1995 deficit continued to grow in 1996 and was \nstill substantially higher in 1997 than in 1995. This \nsuggests that, in contrast to its traditionally “flexi\xad\nble” exchange rate policy, the South Korean gov\xad\nernment failed to reduce overvaluation in the \nbuildup to the current crisis—a policy failure that \nproved fatal when the Japanese yen and the Chinese \nyuan depreciated after 1995 and 1994, respectively.\nBut why was there such a mismanagement of the \nexchange rate? We can suggest a few reasons. First, \nthere was the increasing dominance of monetarist \nideology in the country’s policy circles, which held \nthat inflation control was the most important pol\xad\nicy objective and that the exchange rate should be \nused to “anchor” that policy. Moreover, having built \nup a large foreign debt, it was also (jusdy) feared \nthat currency devaluation would make the debt \nrepayment burden unbearable. Last, there was a \nwidespread belief that the Kim government did not \nwant to devalue because it would have set the coun\xad\ntry’s per capita income below the symbolic $10,000 \nbenchmark that had been achieved in 1995.\nAs for "crony \ncap ita lism the  \nsolution lies in \nstrengthening, not \nweakening, the \ncoordinating \nfunction o f the \ngovernment.\n', '440 • CURRENT HISTORY • December 1998\nWas the government’s market-defying industrial \npolicy also responsible for the current crisis in \nSouth Korea? According to this argument, which \nhas gained in popularity, through its industrial pol\xad\nicy, the South Korean government pushed firms \ninto risky investments, while the implicit guaran\xad\ntees that it accorded to those who were investing in \nthe designated industries generated “moral hazard” \non the part of the investors, who then indulged in \nrisky and inefficient investments.\nThis story may provide a convenient scapegoat \nfor those international investors who got carried \naway during the boom time and made poor lending \ndecisions, but it lacks a firm empirical basis.\nSince the mid-1990s, there was litde industrial \npolicy at work in South Korea. The five-year plan\xad\nning practice that had provided the framework for • \npolicy coordination since 1962 was abandoned in \n1993 by the Kim government. Moreover, other than \nin some high-technology industries, the govern\xad\nment basically gave up on sectoral industrial policy, \nwhich could be seen in the decision to allow Sam\xad\nsung into the already overcrowded auto industry in \n1993. Thus, it was the termination of investment \ncoordination, rather than its continuation, that led \nto the excessive investments that were behind the \ncrisis.\nAnother element of the market-defying industrial \npolicy argument holds that South Korean firms \nwere forced by the government into making ineffi\xad\ncient investments. Those who believe this story \nsometimes point to the ostensibly low corporate \nprofitability in the country. Indeed, if we take post- \ninterest-payments profitability, South Korean cor\xad\nporations, at 2.8 percent in 1996, appear much less \nefficient than their counterparts in, say, the United \nStates (7.9 percent in 1995) or even Taiwan (5.1 \npercent in 1995)—bearing in mind that interna\xad\ntional comparison of corporate profitability is \nfraught with difficulties. However, this basically \nreflects high interest payments by South Korean \nfirms, and therefore should not be interpreted as \nshowing South Korean corporate inefficiency. The \ncountry’s corporate profitability before interest pay\xad\nments has not been low by international standards. \nIn 1996, a year of business downturn, the figure for \nSouth Korea was 6.5 percent, which was not much \nlower than 1995 figures for the United States (7.7 \npercent) and Taiwan (7.3 percent). Averaged over a \nlonger period (1973-1996), the South Korean fig\xad\nure was even higher (7.4 percent).\nPerhaps the most embarrassing problem with the \nargument is that we cannot find any evidence that\nthere were implicit government guarantees for \nindustrial enterprises and financial institutions in \nSouth Korea. There has been no single uncondi\xad\ntional bailout of industrial enterprises or financial \ninstitutions, at least during the last two decades. \nBetween 1990 and 1996, 3 of the 30 largest chae\xad\nbols went bankrupt, and in 1997, 6 did. Certainly \nthere were occasions on which ailing firms received \nassistance, but this was invariably accompanied by \na government-mediated takeover or the imposition \nof clear terms of enterprise restructuring, almost \nalways involving the forced exit of the existing \nmanagers and owners. The important point in rela\xad\ntion to the “moral hazard” story is not whether \nsome struggling enterprises were helped out by the \ngovernment (which they were), but whether bad \nmanagement was punished or not—and in South \nKorea, punished it was.\nSome fundamental shifts\nBehind South Korea’s ill-fated experiments with \nliberalization lay some fundamental changes in polit\xad\nical and economic power structures and ideologies.\nOver the last decade or so, the chaebols have \nbecome increasingly independent of the government \nas they have gained direct access to the international \ncapital market and acquired controlling stakes in \nminor financial institutions, such as merchant \nbanks. And with their increasing independence, the \nchaebols have become more aggressive in calling for \nthe dismantling of government controls.\nDuring the 1990s, there have also been various \nmultilateral and bilateral attempts by the advanced \neconomies, especially the United States, to pry open \nthe South Korean markets, especially in the finan\xad\ncial sector. One obvious reason for the increase in \nsuch pressures was the perception that South Korea \nby the late 1980s was considered rich enough to \nafford a high degree of trade and financial liberal\xad\nization. Another reason was the end of the cold war \nin 1991, which made the advanced countries much \nmore aggressive in pursuing their interests with the \ndeveloping countries. In addition, there had been a \nmarked rise of pro-market ideology since the 1980s \nthroughout the world, which also strongly influ\xad\nenced South Korea.\nThe broad changes in national and international \npower balances and political ideologies do not \nmean that the policy shift that occurred under the \nKim government was simply a reflection of struc\xad\ntural forces beyond any strategic control by South \nKorean policymakers. For example, the demise of \nfive-year planning and sectoral industrial policy was\n', 'South Korea: Anatomy of a Crisis • 441\nthe result of a deliberate strategic choice by the Kim \ngovernment. And the source of intensified external \npressure to liberalize the economy, especially capital \naccounts, was the Kim government’s decision to \napply for an o e c d  membership (which it acquired \nin 1996). In other words, under the Kim govern\xad\nment, there were certain deliberate policy choices \nthat pushed the country down the path of large- \nscale liberalization.\nThe south Korean future\nThe i m f  program for South Korea aims to change \nthe country’s institutional structure into one that is \nAnglo-American. This is, of course, not to say that \nthe program is being imposed entirely against the \nwill of the South Koreans. Many elements of this \nprogram were already implemented or at least con\xad\ntemplated by the Kim Young Sam government; the \ngovernment of President Kim Dae Jung, which took \noffice in February 1998, also partially endorses the \nprogram’s plan for institutional changes.\nO f co u rse , changes in  fo rm al in s ti tu tio n s  can  \nnever specify the universe of individual and insti\xad\ntutional interactions, and therefore it may be too \nearly to predict the future shape of post-IMF South \nKorean institutions. After all, it was out of the \nAmerican system that the American occupation \nauthority imposed on Germany and Japan after \nWorld War II that the very un-American German \nand Japanese economic systems emerged. However, \ngiven the direction in which events are moving, it \nseems likely that the i m f  program will push the \ncountry substantially in the Anglo-American direc\xad\ntion. Will this change revitalize the economy, as the \nauthors of the i m f  program and many (but by no \nmeans all) of the main policymakers in the Kim Dae \nJung government believe?\nThe unstated logic behind the i m f  program’s \npush for further financial liberalization is that, with \nthe opening up of the financial market, more able \nforeign financial institutions will enter South Korea \nand put its financial house in order. However, these \nare the same institutions that lent large sums to the \nbadly managed South Korean financial institutions \nin the first place and that have blatantly defied mar\xad\nket logic (which they insist the South Koreans \nshould now adhere to) by asking the government \nto guarantee a large amount of private-sector debts.\nThe proposal to restrain reckless corporate \nexpansion through greater exposure to the threat of \ndomestic and international takeovers is not com\xad\npletely pointless, but the evidence from the ad\xad\nvanced countries suggests that the takeover mech\xad\nanism has serious downsides. It can shrink invest\xad\nment horizons and even create its own version of \nreckless corporate expansion by allowing large but \ninefficient firms or professional corporate raiders to \ntake over small but efficient firms.\nMaking redundancy easier may be desirable in \nthe long run, if combined with well-managed uni\xad\nversal unemployment insurance and retraining \nschemes, since the current system of quasi-lifetime \nemployment and company-based welfare provision \ntends to favor workers in the large firms. However, \nthis is not something that can be done as quickly as \nthe i m f  program demands because it requires sea \nchanges in South Korean attitudes and institutions \nregarding job security, taxation, corporate recruit\xad\nment and pay structure, and industrial training. In a \nperiod of deflationary macroeconomic pressure, \nsuch changes are likely only to exacerbate eco\xad\nnomic and social conflicts.\nAnd as for “crony capitalism,” the solution lies \nin  streng then ing , n o t w eaken ing , th e  coord inating  \nfunction of the government, since this will set a \nclear limit on how far rules can be bent. Reforms in \nthe civil-service pay structure to make its salaries \ncompetitive with those in the private sector for \ncomparable jobs will reduce incentives for bureau\xad\ncrats to accept bribes, while extending the changes \nin the political funding system that were made \nunder the Kim Young Sam government will also \nmake state-business relationships more open to \nscrutiny.\nSouth Korea’s short-term prospects are bleak. \nEven if the current phase of its economic down\xad\nward spiral can somehow be halted—which is a tall \norder in  the face of the new waves of financial \ncrises—the country will have suffered a significant \nreduction in its productive capacity following the \nmass bankruptcies and the collapse in investments \nduring the last year. The social tension that is \nrapidly building up since the mass bankruptcies \nand mass unemployment will not help restore \ndomestic and foreign investors’ confidence either.\nIf the experience of many developing and transi\xad\ntion economies during the last two decades is any\xad\nthing to go by, an iMF-style structural reform \nprogram cannot deliver the efficiency and \ndynamism it promises, especially when it aims to \nchange deep-rooted structures and institutions \novernight. Unfortunately, there is little reason to \nbelieve that its program in South Korea will be an \nexception to this rule. ■\n']</pre>
