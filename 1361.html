Moses, a, 4v?er. pays a trloute to Alaska not only, M the land of opportunity but as a, place to UVF.. The letter should be, given the widest publicity, an the view, of a man who KNOWS from experi, ence. Mr. Moses >ays:, "Three or four years ago there was, a powibiliiy of my going to Alaska to,, live, but advancing years and t*e pen, alties a m?n must pay for growing old, (I am 81 years voung) warn me that it, were unwise to go and pioneer again, at my age. I began in California, January 1, 1S&0, "I still think Alaska offers the very, best opportunities for a youn* man, ol, any one of the now u noccupied lands of, the United States. Ita mining possi, bilities are the only ones now that are, equal to the "Days of old. the days of, gold, the days of \'+9\' in California. Its, vast coal deposits are a future asset of, =reat value, and when ih# coal shall be, brought to tide-water will give employ, ment to many men and return great, revenue to Sewatd and other ports of, shipment. Its copper and tin. near the, arctic circle, are of ({real value. Its, fisheries and canning industries find a, paying comtfvtition even with the banks, of Newfoundland or the prolific store, bouses of wealth of the seas of northern, Europe, its vast area of forests of, coniferous trees, the spruce and pine,, in the not far distant future, will, be the chief source of supply for the, paper pulp for the use of the art pre, servative., "There Is a mistaken idea in the, minds of nine-tenths of the people of the, United Slates about tbe climate of, Alaska, and a t\'reat msny ,li" ipe*k, o? it as the frozen north, the land of the, midnight sun, of six month\'s darkness,, Seward\'s ice box, and only tit for seals,, walrus and polar bear to live In. And, it would be all that were it not, ihat nature has sent the warm water, of th? Japanese current, the gult, ?treau! of the Indies and -far Cathay\', with its beneficent militating influence, full and freely upon the Aleutian, islands and the coasts, and for 100 or, more miles inland of northern Alaska,, modifying the temperature of the groat, valley of the Susitna river by raising, the temperature so that its annual, mean is far wanner than the Dakotas., Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and, northern Michigan. And how few, know that Sitka and San Francisco ai e, but one half of a degree different in, their annual mean? w degrees fcr, Sitka and 5>">i degrees for San fcran, clsco. And how few people realize that, were it not for the gulf stream of the, Atlantic, Ireland. Scotland and north, ern England would be the counterpart, of Labrador, the lattitude of each being, the same. On account of nature\'s ef, forts, Alaska possesses rare advantages, for agriculture. Fruiu, vegetables,, hay, and the cereals grow rapidly and, In profusion. And Us a stock country it, will soon furcish abundance for its owe, use, and would have much to spare for, Others.

It lacks, roads and facilities for travel to the In, terior, and relies on the pack mule and, the trail, or the dog sled and \'mushing, it.\' So It was in California, when for, the first eighteen years there were but, 75 Miles of railroad in the state.

C. McCtur*.], Parson Wllllums, feeling sorry for, Detcoa Flint\'s widowhood, suggested, that h? take u girl from the orphan, asylum to keep house aud for com, pany., The deacon started for the city uext, inorulug and returned In the evening, with the orphan. Her name was, Ruth. The dettcou liked lier at llrst, glance. and he kept liking her better, all day. Before going to bed that night, she was shown over the house and, through the pantry and told what to, get for breakfast and at what hour to, have It ready, aud the deacon\'s heart, swelled up as she called to hlin:, "Good night, my own dear old papa., Your little daughter Is awfully glad, she has come to live with you.", Breakfast was to be ready at 0., The deacon overslept, and It was 7, before he got out of bed and went, downstairs. There was no one about., Me knocked at the daughter\'s door,, but got no answer. He went outside, to look for her, aud, tludlug nothing, he, returned and opened the door of her, room. She was still asleep, but when, he called to her she woke up and de, manded to know whfct was wanted., "You should have had breakfast all, ready an hour ago.", "Not ou your life!" she exclaimed., "When you Ret It ready come and call, me.", "But? but, what do you mean?" de, manded the astonished man., "You skiddoo and don\'t ask questlous., Say, |>op. you might as well under, stand right now that I\'m a lady and, must be treated as such. After this 1, shall take my breakfast In bed.", The deacon got breakfast, aud Miss, Ruth came down. She found faull, with everything and when reproved, gave him such back talk that he, reached over and boxed her ears. The, uext minute everything un the table, she could reach was tlylng at his head., After being hit by three plates, the, cruet, the coffeepot and the sugai, bowl he flew the coop and made his, way to the parson\'s house., "Ab," said the good man, "1 was, wondering If you came home last night, and bronght the orphan with you." \', "I didl" exclaimed the deacon with a, great deal of energy., "And? and"?, "And you come over anil nee nor. I, She was as humble as a kitten last, night, but this morning she seems to, be a limb of Satan.", When the house was reached the], adopted orphan was found in the yard|, throwing pieces of the broken crock- 1, ery at the hens, and she had already, lamed an old rooster and knocked a, speckled hen gaily west., "Morning, parson." she called out., "I suppose pop\'s been telling what a, bad kid I am? If he wasn\'t a dub he\'d, have stayed and fought It out with, me.", "My dear child. 1 am sorry to hear, such reports of you." solemnly replied, the parson. "You seemed to me the, other day to be such an innocent, hum, ble young girl that"?, "That was in the game, parsou. I, was after a papa and a home. Ob, I, can be an angel when I want to. See, me knock that black hen\'s head off.", The parson and the deacon walked, a^Ide to consult, and the latter asked, lu anxious tones:, "Well, what shall 1 do about it?", "Sit down with her and talk of, heaven and angels and appeal to her, I letter nature. I think you will have, her crying in tlve minutes, it seems, that in some way I must have got a, wrong Impression of the child.", The good tuan returned home, and, the deacon sat down to try moral sua, sion. The village graveyard was in, s\'\'.:ht. and he looked over at the stones, and asked the girl If she knew where, good folks went to when they died., ?Oh. come off!" she answered. "Can\'t, we go to a circus or something today?, I knew you was an old poke, but I\'ve, | come to stir you up. Come in and, shave. 1 don\'t like your whiskers.", The deacou rose up aud took her by, the ear aud led her Into the house and, locked her up In a closet and said, something about bread and water until, she could behave herself. He then, went to the tield to put In a short fore, noon. At 12 o\'clock, when he came, back, the closet door lay on the floor,, the table and chairs were on their, backs, and the girl was getting ready, to smash windows. The deacon went, out and cut and irlmmed a peach tree, limb and wore It out around her shoul, ders a:d locked her up In another, closet. At :i o\'clock In the afternoon, Ills barn was found to be on fir# and, couldn\'t be saved He weflt to the, hou.ve l? find the prisoner g?o?. every, thing a wreck and the following note, pinned to n door:, Deur Pupa? You aro no gentleman, anil, I don\'t llko your style. A? you o?n\'t, hu*tl>\\ I will., And on top of that the good parson, came around to condolo with him and, to say:, "I guess we rande a mistake, deacon., Instead of trying adoption plan, agalu why not take a wife*", The parson had a spinster elster for, ty-two years old. and public gow.\'j had, said that she would marry the deacon, if asked. The brother had heard noth, ing of this, nnd the sister was not in, his mind In the least when he put the, question, but the deacon turned from, surveying the wreck and answered:, "N\'ot by a durned sight, and you get, right out of here or I\'ll throw you over, the fence!", And that was ten years ago, and they, have not spoken to each other since., JkL QT7AD., ?+i I t, + f, t THE YOUNG |, | \' TELEGRAPHER. +, Marlon of the Revolutionary war, and Morgan of the clvl! war occupy, similar positions In hHtory Grtierjd, John Morgan started on his military, career as commander of u company of, young Confederates and operated ul, ways In t lie middle southwest. Ills, career was full of during, lie would, approach a I\'ulou picket, assuming to, be u Federal officer, reprimand him, for some negligence, gel possession of, his uiusket and thus capture single, handed a whole picket post., It was during the campaign of Gen, eral Ilalleck against Quaker guns at, Corinth that Morgan was operating In, Halleck\'s rear in western Tennessee,, harassing lines of communication., This Is a very Important service. An, army must lie fed. That means that, the avenues of t ouimuuicatlon must lie, kept open and the supplies passing, over them to the men at the front, must he protected. In this work an, Important feature lo the protecting, force was the telegraph., The telegraph office at the town of, P., a station on the railroad supply, ing the army before Corinth, was iu, charge of Tom Venable, who lived, with his family oil the upper lioor of, the two ftory station building, ihe tele, graph and ticket office being below., One night when Venable was in his, | office sending ihe dispatches necessary, i to get a heavy Iran load of supplies, south he heard a tap oil the window, pane. Looking up. there stood a man, lu Confederate uniform covering him, with the muzzle of his pistol. The offi, cer had tup[>ed with I iie pislol to at, tract Veuable\'s attention and ordered, him to throw up the sash. Venable, did so, and the officer climbed in at the, window., "I\'m John Morgan." he said., Morgan usually declared himself In, this fashion. It was the best possible, way of striking an enemy with terror., Meanwhile the station was surround, ed by Confederate cuvalryinen. Mor, gan put his own telegrapher at the key,, who began to telegraph the train Ven, able had been iu communication with., The conductor had been warned that, the Confederates were making a raid, in the region and was waiting to be, assured that it was safe to advance., Morgan\'s telegrapher sent a dispatch, that Morgan had gone off iu an easter, ly direction and an order signed by a, I\'ulon commander for the train tc, Original.}, I\'Oiue on., Now, there Is a hero to this story,, though ho Is asleep In his bed above, the telegraph office. Hut a clatter he, I noath awakes hliu. Being not over, [ thirteen years old. he doesn\'t awake in, a hurry, but his mother helps hlui by, telling hltn that the station Is In pos, session of the dreaded Morgan. Jlui, iii le Venable was of a scientific mind, ?uul had already a miniature telegraph, outtit In his own little room. His cir, cuit was but teu feet and was confined, to the rooui, but It was big enough to, play with, and he knew the dot and, line aiphnl>et. His father was a prls, oner downstairs, but he heard his, mother say that doubtless Morgan had, captured the telegraph in order to de, coy a train into a trap and destroy the, supplies lu tended for the Union army., Jitnmle got an Idea. The telegraph, wires passed within ten feet of his, I window before entering the otllee l?e, [ low. He told his mother what he in, tended to do, and she helped hltn." lie, took his play wire, tied a hairbrush to, one end of It. threw It over the line, wire and completed Ills circuit by, means of a lead pipe extending to the, ground, it didn\'t make a very good, connection, but It sufficed. ile didn\'t, know the calls of stations nor what, station to call. He waited till there, was comparative quiet below, then, clicked: "P. station. Morgan here.", This he repeated several times. It was, heard at\'several stations up the road,, and the conductor of the tralu was ad, vised of It at once., One man heard It for whom It was, not Intended. That was the Confederate, operating in the office below Jimmle\'s, room. He was sitting near the kej, when he heard the words clicked and, knew that some one had outwitted, him. He notified his commanJer. and a, search was made, and Jlmtnle\'s hair, brush was seeu dangling from the, main wire. It toid them the story,, ti ling npsiai;.*. they dlr ovcrcd J! i, mie\'s device. The g< eivl was t\':o, titvr to enter the r .v i .Ihmnie wis, still at Ills key., "Have you been aeudii.g Informa, tion t?> the ci-emy?" he a \'..cd., "Yes, I have," snld .Tl-\'tnle proudly., He did not knew Hi,- ? ter:L "f the, service lie had re;.i.?. i .??!. l?ot vra sure, he had done something va! able !<>\' his, cause., "L>o you know what we do with lit, tle boys who are spies?" asked Mor, gan., "No.", "Well, it\'s something very terrible., But In this case the boy is a very, bright, brave little chap, and we will, give him something for candy.", He drew a roll of Confederate bills, from his pocket, picked out a ten dol, lar note and handed it to Jlminie., "H-tn!" said Jlmmle, looking at it con, temptuously. " "fatn\'t worth a United, States fifty cent postal shinplaster.", \' This postal currency was used during, the war lu lieu of silver., Morgan laughed, took out a roll of, greenbacks, doubtless captured money,, and, haudlug a five dollar note to the, boy. went downstairs and rode away,, followed by his troopers., For saving the tralu Jlminie after, ward received a much larger reward, from the United States government., NORMAN P.
