After\na long experience with mortality ta\nbles, Mr. Frederick L. Hoffman,\nwriter upon insurance subjects, demon\'\nstrates tne influence or marriage on\nlongevity. Interesting figures show\nthat the mortality ot married males has\nbeen considerably below the mortality\nof single males at all ages, the differ\nence being most noticeable between\nthe age periods of 45 and 64 years. Be\ntween those ages, roughly speaking,\nthree single men die to two married\nones, says the St. Louis Republic.\nTbe record of females gives a result\nfavorable to married women. Although\ntheir death, rat is greater than that of\nsingle women in tbe period between\nIS and 44 years, after that period the\nproportions- are reversed in favor of\nthe married women.\nIn both sexes, below the age of 40,\nthe deaths among married person,\ndue to certain specific causes, are\nslightly in excess of deaths among sin\ngle persons, lne causes are cancer,\ntumor, nervous diseases,\' circulatory,\ndigestive, and urinary diseases. ut\ndeaths from consumption among gin\ngle persons are preponde.ratingly\ngreater than those among married.\nAbove the age of 45 the mortality of\nthe married in both sexes, from all\ncauses, is much less than of single peo\nple. Mr. Hoffman unhesitatingly con\ncludes that" marriage makes for long\nlife.\nUndoubtedly many factors other\nthan the fact of marriage contribute\nto decide the question of . longevity.\nThe question of regular living and set\ntled habits must be considered as well\nas that of tfaehuman being fulfillinghit\nnatural destiny and following natural\nlaws. .\nA BIG HORN\'S DARING LEAP.\n1\nor pel loaded revolver in his pouket is Uuiet-fi0mbre dav of re8t- Per\nneaP\nluet,\nI Lit\nrithIou:\nun\nvan\n\'"leai\nready to commit murder, and\nBooner or later may do so.

The lead pencil evil eeems to be\nprincipally confined t o women and chil\ndren.

Children seem to be of\nthe belief that it is next to impossible\nto write with a lead pencil until they\nbav\'e wet the lead in their mouths.\n"And about fans, have you ever no\nticed how most people will bite and\nbite on a fan that in every way bears\nthe evidence of old age, and of having\nbeen bitten many times? It seems to\nmake no difference ia the world the\nfact that the fans are common prop\nerty and that, tbey as much belong to\nthe tobacco-chewing men as they do\nto the sweet-faced, refined, dainty\naoroen, does not matter.. They seem to\nbe happy in the pastime of biting on in-def-Mtely.\n.\n"When sores appear that do not\neotre from fever, were I to Suggest\nsue h a source as I have ju6t described,\nnervous prostration would be the re\nsult In many cases." - y-\nx ( A DiNf Clock.\nA rturalist, while visiting on of\nthe Ct..vLA jslanua, found -a curious\ntime recorder lodged at the house\nof a rajah.

The bonds for 100 are\nworth somewhere about 23 only, and\nthere has been no payment of inter\nest since June, 1899. Even then only\na paltry two per cent, was paid, apd\nhalf of that was not in cash. Hon\nduras is a far worse debtor. The\nbonds which have a face value of 100\nare dear at 3.

Nearly\nthe tvhole oi these debts are due to\nSr1!:!. creditors.

Even\nother countries, about which we know\nfar more, such as Greece and Turkey,\nare almost as bad. A Greek 100\nbond is worth from 31 to 44, ac\ncording to its class.
