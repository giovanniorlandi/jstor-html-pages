        <pre>['Contending Narratives of the  \nInternational Order:  \nUS/Chinese Discursive Power and Its  \nEffects on the UK\nRex Li\nThe multifaceted competition between the United States \nand China has attracted much scholarly attention. Existing \nstudies tend to focus on the material dimensions of the \nUS-China rivalry. In this article I analyze the master/counternarratives\nproduced by the two great powers that are \nintended to exercise their discursive power in shaping the \ngeopolitical environment and legitimizing their global roles. \nSpecifically, I examine the competing US and Chinese narratives\non the international order and assess the impact of \nthese narratives on shaping the values and interests of the \nUnited Kingdom. My research demonstrates that China’s \nworld order narratives have limited influence on the United \nKingdom due to the fundamental differences in their political\nvalues, ideologies, and systems. Nevertheless, British \nleaders and policy elites are becoming more receptive to Chinese\nnarratives, given China’s growing economic power and \n“disciplinary power” to coerce other countries to accept its \npreferred narratives, as well as the uncertainty faced by the \nUnited Kingdom in the post-Brexit international economic \nenvironment. \nKeywords: US, China, UK, discursive power, narratives, liberal\ninternational order, world order.\nThe mulTifaceTed compeTiTion beTween The uniTed STaTeS and china \nin international relations is a significant phenomenon in the twenty-first \ncentury, which could have profound implications for global peace and \nprosperity. This competition is explained in the extant literature largely \nin terms of a classic geopolitical contest over political influence, economic\ndominance, and military power (see, for example, Friedberg \n2012; Mastro 2015). According to this view, the two countries are beAsian\nPerspective 43 (2019), 349–385  \n© 2019 Institute for Far Eastern Studies, Kyungnam University\n', '350 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nlieved to be engaging in a geopolitical rivalry as a result of China’s \nrapid rise as a great power and the changing balance of power in the \nAsia-Pacific region. A classic theoretical interpretation of this contest \nis the power transition theory, which postulates a “Thucydides trap” between\na dominant power that tussles to maintain its hegemonic position \nin the international system and a rising power that attempts to challenge \nthe prevailing international order (Organski and Kugler 1980; Allison \n2017). This analysis is underpinned by realist theory, which emphasizes \nsuch material factors as strategic balance and military capabilities in explicating\nthe US-China rivalry and its wider implications (Gilpin 1980; \nTill 2012; Mearsheimer 2014, chap. 10). What is omitted from this literature\nis serious consideration of the metanarratives produced by both the \nUnited States and China that are intended to exercise discursive power \nin shaping the geopolitical environment and influencing the thinking \nand action of other actors.1 \nCentral to the discursive rivalry between the United States and China\nis their competing narratives on the existing international order and \nits future development. While the United States has been a fervent advocate\nof the liberal international order (LIO), China has begun active and \nproactive promotion of its vision and discourse on world order. These \nnarratives target a wide range of audiences in Asia, Europe, and other \nparts of the world. This article focuses on the analysis of the narratives \ngenerated by the two rival powers during the Barack Obama administration\nand Xi Jinping era. Specifically, it assesses the extent to which the \ncontending US/Chinese narratives have succeeded in shaping the values \nand interests of the United Kingdom, a long-standing friend and ally of \nthe United States with whom the UK shares many common values. Yet \nBritain is keen to develop a closer relationship with China, which was \ndescribed by the former British prime minister David Cameron as “a \ngolden era” (Shirbon 2015). The British responses to the changing international\norder offer an interesting case study for assessing the effects \nof the US-China narrative competition.\nThis article makes an original contribution to the literature on the \ninternational order and US-China relations by demonstrating the significance\nof competing US/China narratives on the international order in \nshaping international perceptions and exercising discursive power on \nthird parties. In particular, I demonstrate how the United States and China\nare vying for dominant narratives on the international order that reflect \ntheir national identity, cultural traditions, domestic ideology, political \nsystems, foreign policy goals, and future aspirations. In terms of methodology,\nthe study uncovers the deeper or hidden meanings of the narra-\ntives produced by the United States and China through discourse analysis. \n', 'Rex Li 351\nThere has been much debate on the definition of discourse analysis \nin the academic literature (see, for example, Alba-Juez 2009, chap. 1). \nDiscourse analysis is often referred to as “language in use,” as it deals \nwith the study of both “text” and “context.” According to Deborah Schiffrin,\n“text” is “the linguistic content . . . but not the inferences available \nto hearers depending upon the contexts in which words, expressions, \nand sentences are used,” while “context” is “a world filled with people \nproducing utterances: people who have social, cultural, and personal \nidentities, knowledge, beliefs, goals and wants, and who interact with \none another in various socially and culturally defined situations” (Schiffrin\n1994, 363). As Gillian Brown and George Yule argue, the analysis of \ndiscourse “cannot be restricted to the description of linguistic forms independent\nof the purposes or functions which those forms are designed \nto serve in human affair” (Brown and Yule 1983, 1).\nThe primary sources for analyzing the US and Chinese narratives \nare official documents such as the speeches and statements of political \nleaders and government officials, as these documents provide the most \nauthoritative conduits through which they perform their “speech acts.” \nSome articles written by influential policy elites and media sources are \nalso consulted given their important role in constructing the narratives \non the international order. While the analytical focus of the article is on \nthe Obama–Xi Jinping era, the discursive rivalry between the United \nStates and China will be considered in the light of the Trump presidency\nand Brexit. The article begins with a theoretical discussion of the \ncomplex relationships between narratives and “reality” from a constructivist\nperspective, focusing in particular on the performative functions \nof “speech acts.” The second section provides an analysis of the US \nnarratives of the LIO and how this is linked to its concern of the China \nchallenge. The third section examines China’s critique of the US-led \nLIO and its narratives on the changing international order within which \nChina aspires to play a more prominent role. This is followed by a consideration\nof the effects of the use of discursive power by the United \nState and China on the United Kingdom.\nMaster/Counternarratives of the International \nOrder and US-China Discursive Power Rivalry\nFrom the constructivist perspective, the world does not exist as an objective\nreality. Rather, the “reality” is historically and socially constructed \n(Wendt 1999). The narratives of what type of international order should \n', '352 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nbe established or maintained has been contested ground for social construction\nbetween the United States and China through their articulation \nand dissemination of particular discourses. However, this discursive rivalry\nand its implications for third parties have received scant scholarly \nattention (Weissmann 2018).\nIt can be argued that discourses are not simply representations of \nthe reality but discursive activities or “speech acts” (Searle 1969; Austin\n1975) that seek to construct the social reality. To Nicholas Onuf, \n“Language is both representative and performative. People use words \nto represent deeds and they can use words, and words alone, to perform \ndeeds” (Onuf 1989, 82). In other words, language enables actors to construct\nor create their social world. As Onuf argues, “Speech acts are so-\ncial performances, that is, they have direct social consequences. . . . Because\npeople respond to them with their own performances, not always \nspoken, the patterns of speech acts and related performances constitute \nthose practices that make the material conditions and artifacts of human \nexperience meaningful” (Onuf 1989, 183). Speaking is thus “an activity \nwith normative consequences” (Onuf 2001, 77). \nSimilarly, in their formulation of the concept of securitization, Barry\nBuzan, Ole Weaver, and Jaap de Wilde refer to speech acts as the \n“process of constructing a shared understanding”; “it is the utterance \nitself that is the act” in the sense that “by saying the words, something \nis done” (Buzan, Weaver, and de Wilde 1998, 26). As David Campbell \nobserves, “The world exists independently of language, but we cannot \nknow that (beyond the facts of its assertion), because the existence of \nthe world is literally inconceivable outside of language and our traditions\nof interpretation” (Campbell 1998, 6). Thus, language or discourse \nrefers to not only the articulation of ideas but also the contention of \nwhat constitutes the reality. As Hayden White asserts, discourse aims \nto “constitute the ground whereon to decide what shall count as a fact \nin the matter under consideration and to determine what mode of comprehension\nis best suited to understanding of the facts thus constituted” \n(White 1978, 3).\nWhy have US and Chinese leaders and elites paid so much attention \nto the narratives of the international order? These narratives are best \nseen as what Jean-François Lyotard calls “metanarratives,” which offer \nan overarching schema that explains and orders human experience and \nknowledge (Lyotard 1984). Essentially, a metanarrative is “a big story” \nthat provides a guiding framework within which smaller stories are told. \nMetanarratives can be instrumental in rationalizing or legitimizing specific\nforms of power relations. As the international order or world order \n', 'Rex Li 353\nis about “the distribution of power and authority among the political \nactors on the global stage” (Falk 1999, 29), it provides a metanarrative \nfor the leading advocates of a particular order to shape the behavior of \nthe actors within the international system.\nKarl Schonberg is right in arguing that “language enables human \nbeings to communicate, but also traps them within the set of meanings \nattached to the words they use” (Schonberg 2009, 11). As such, the narratives\non the international order manufactured by Washington and Bei-\njing in their “communicative space” with each other and with the third \nparties are designed to “trap” them within the specific boundary of the \narticulated language. This can be seen as attempts by the United States \nand China to exert their discursive power through specific language or \ndiscourse. Many scholars of discourse studies concur that language is \nindispensable in the exercise or assertion of power (Fairclough 2001; \nvan Dijk 2008). Indeed, Michel Foucault considers discourses part of \nbroader social processes that are closely associated with power relations.\nTo Foucault (1972), discourses are constantly exploited by dif-\nferent groups of people to reinforce, contest, or subvert existing power-knowledge\nrelations. Similarly, Linus Hagström and Björn Jerdén \ncontend that power could be defined as the capacity of actors and discourses\nto produce effects (Hagström and Jerdén 2014; see also Morriss \n2002). This interpretation of power is particularly useful in elucidating \nwhy the United States and China are using carefully crafted narratives \nof the international order to produce the effects on other actors that \nwould serve their respective interests. In essence, the United States has \nbeen producing and maintaining the dominant narratives on the LIO. At \nthe same time, China has become increasingly active in generating its \ncounternarratives that accept certain elements of the US narratives but \nchallenge other aspects of the liberal narratives by advocating its own \nversion and vision of the world order. Both countries are striving to \nmake their own narratives attractive to a wide range of audiences in the \ninternational system.\nThe discursive battle between the United States and China in their \nnarratives of the international order is usefully understood through Michael\nDamberg’s conceptualization of master (or dominant) narratives \nand counternarratives. Damberg maintains that master narratives are \nsetting up “routines” through various means and that they have a tendency\nto “normalize” or “naturalize” the routines, which can “constrain \nand delineate the agency of subjects” and reduce “the range of their actions.”\nThese master narratives provide helpful “guidance” and a “sense \nof direction” for the subjects (Damberg 2004, 360). He believes that the \n', '354 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nconstruction of counternarratives does not necessarily mean a complete \nrejection of the master narratives, as “complicity and countering are \nactivities that go hand-in-hand” (Damberg 2004, 353). In other words, \nmaster narratives “are not automatically hegemonic” and “complicity \nwith them does not automatically result in being complicit with or supportive\nof hegemonic power-knowledge complexes” (Damberg 2004, \n360). Through the analysis of the contending US and Chinese narratives \nof the international order, this article hopes to make a unique contribution\nto the theorization of master/counternarratives in the context of \ninternational relations and US-China relations in particular.\nThe Liberal International Order and Global \nLeadership: US Narratives under Obama\nFor over seventy years US leaders have been actively promoting the vision\nof an LIO led by the United States (Brands 2016), although the term \nLIO rose to prominence only with G. John Ikenberry’s writing on liberal \ninternationalism (see, for example, Ikenberry 2011a) and it was rarely \nused by US politicians and elite newspapers prior to the Obama years.2 \nDespite differences over specific policies, successive US governments \nhave been committed to such values as democracy, liberty, freedom, \nand the free market. All these values, regarded by US leaders and policy \nelites as significant symbols of their national identity, are also essential \nto the construction of a liberal world order. As Gideon Rose, editor of \nForeign Affairs, observes, “[For] generations, the central challenge for \nU.S. foreign policy has been straightforward: consolidate, protect, and \nextend the liberal international order that the United States helped create \nafter World War II” (Rose 2015).\nTo be sure, there has long been a debate among US politicians and \nelites over the direction of US foreign policy. The isolationists argue \nthat US military involvement in other regions such as Europe and Asia \nshould be limited. This is because the United States is sufficiently secure\ndue to its geographical location, military strength, and economic \npower. It is therefore unnecessary for the United States to define its national\ninterest too broadly to include the protection of the security and \nfreedom of all its friends and allies in various parts of the world. This \nview has been contested by other US leaders however, including former \npresident Obama, who saw the global leadership of the United States as \nvital to maintaining a liberal democratic international order. Obama was \nzealous in sustaining the master narrative of the LIO. He used passion-\n', 'Rex Li 355\nate and effective language to disseminate the discourse that US national\ninterest and security could be enhanced immensely in a rules-based \ninternational system, where major international economic and security \nissues would be resolved through multilateral institutions and international\norganizations.\nThese types of narratives were echoed by many other officials and \ndiplomats in the Obama administration. For instance, in a 2015 security \nconference speech in Berlin, ambassador John B. Emerson replicated \nObama’s liberal discourse that the transatlantic alliance “was built on \nthe understanding that a rules- and values-based international order was \nmutually beneficial for all, and it was made possible because of our \nshared interests, shared history, and shared sacrifices” (Emerson 2015).\nIn his “speech acts” (Searle 1969) at the United Nations in September\n2016, Obama reaffirmed his conviction in a US-led rule-based \ninternational system: “[We] are all stakeholders in this international system,\nand it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to \nwhich we belong. . . . Many nations have shown what kind of progress \nis possible when we make those commitments” (Obama 2016). This \npoint was emphasized in relation to China by Robert D. Hormats, under \nsecretary for economic, energy, and agricultural affairs in the Obama \nadministration: \nOver the past decade and a half, China has enjoyed dramatic growth, \nthanks largely to its own reforms and hard work of the Chinese people. . . .  \nBut China’s dramatic growth is also due to a stable global financial system,\nmarket access benefits of WTO membership and enormous capital \ninflows. . . . The global system becomes more valuable to China as it \nbecomes more intertwined with the fortunes of the rest of the world, and \ntherefore it has a greater stake in the success of that system. (Hormats \n2011) \nThus, rising powers like China could be integrated into a US-led liberal\ninternational system as a “stakeholder” (Ikenberry 2008). Indeed, \nObama believed that the United States should continue with its efforts \nto engage China with the hope that it would become a US partner in \ntackling various global issues. In support of Obama’s narratives, Deputy\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken maintained, “Rather than con-\nstraining us, the rules-based international order has legitimated, preserved,\nand amplified our power over time” (Blinken 2016b). Here the \nlanguage could not have been more explicit—the metanarratives on LIO \nplayed a significant role in rationalizing the power relations between the \nUnited States and other countries in the world.\n', '356 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nAnother important element of the LIO narratives is the theory of \ndemocratic peace, which postulates that democracies do not fight democracies\n(Doyle 1983). This is rooted in US political ideology that un-\nderscores the liberal values of freedom and democracy. It is therefore in \nthe national interest of the United States to promote democracy around \nthe world, which was historically linked to its foreign policy during the \nCold War years. Indeed, Obama was keen to promote democracy and \ndemocratization in the world. This was evidenced by his decision to \nsupport political and economic reform in the Middle East and North \nAfrica following the Arab Spring in 2011. As Obama put it, “It will be \nthe policy of the United States to promote reform across the region, and \nto support transitions to democracy” (White House 2011). But given \nthe US experience in Afghanistan and Iraq under the George W. Bush \nadministration, he was disinclined to get enmeshed in military conflicts \nin countries not seen as core interests for the United States such as the \nUkraine and Syria. Nevertheless, Obama’s conception of US national \nidentity was underpinned by the political values of liberalism in that \nit should play a leading role in promoting liberal democratic ideas and \ngovernance and democratic peace (White House 2010b). Obama made \nthis argument explicitly at the US Military Academy at West Point in \n2014: “America’s support for democracy and human rights goes beyond \nidealism—it is a matter of national security. Democracies are our closest\nfriends and are far less likely to go to war” (White House 2014). \nMoreover, Obama asserted that the United States “created webs of commerce,\nsupported an international architecture of laws and institutions, \nand spilled American blood in foreign lands” to “advance the basic \nrights upon which our Nation was founded.” He went on to say that “our \nsupport for universal rights is both fundamental to American leadership \nand a source of our strength in the world” (White House 2010a). The \n“social performances” (Onuf 1989, 183) of Obama’s democratic peace \nnarratives were intended for the preservation of an international order \nthat mirrored American liberal values and the assertion of US power in \nthe world.\nDuring a visit to Poland, Blinken quoted Pope John Paul II in his \nspeech: “Every generation needs to know that freedom consists not in \ndoing what we like, but in having the right to do what we ought.” He \nargued strongly that “it is the inherent right of citizens in a democracy\nto make their country’s decisions and determine their country’s fu-\nture,” and that “all members of the international community are bound \nby common rules and should face costs if they do not live up to the \nsolemn commitments that they make.” “These principles,” according to \n', 'Rex Li 357\nhis rule-based order narratives, “are the fundamental rules that underpin \nthe international order that together we have sought to build, sustain, \nand as necessary adapt.” He went on to emphasize how the building of \n“an international system of institutions, of rules, of norms dedicated to \npeace and progress” made an immense contribution to the prevention of \n“a return to war between and among great powers” and the creation of \n“a safe, stable environment in which countries could grow and develop \nto the benefit of all their citizens.” Specifically, the vision of the “transatlantic\nproject” between the United States and Europe was believed to \nhave flourished which provided “a foundation of democracy and stability”\nthat had underwritten “an unparalleled period of peace and pros-\nperity for Europe, the United States, and much of the world” (Blinken \n2016a). This is a powerful speech act in celebrating the virtues and benefits\nof the LIO in the context of strengthening US-Europe relations.\nIndeed, the promotion of liberal ideas and a ruled-based international\norder was central to Obama’s thinking in defining the national identity \nof the United States. In US narratives of the LIO, China has often been \ndepicted as an illiberal regime that does not respect the universal values \nof democracy and human rights. China’s human rights practices are regularly\ncondemned by US officials and in the US Department of State’s \nannual human rights reports.3 During Xi Jinping’s visit to the United \nStates in September 2015, Obama raised the issue of human rights with \nhim. In a Joint Press Conference with Xi in the White House, Obama \nmade his position clear: “I again affirmed America’s unwavering support\nfor the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, in-\ncluding freedom of assembly and expression, freedom of the press and \nfreedom of religion. And I expressed in candid terms our strong view \nthat preventing journalists, lawyers, NGOs and civil society groups \nfrom operating freely, or closing churches and denying ethnic minorities\nequal treatment are all problematic” (White House 2015). By criti-\ncizing China’s lack of political freedom and poor human rights record, \nthe Obama administration was in effect questioning the moral position \nof China in the LIO. In the meantime, the Obama administration raised \nserious concerns about the security implications of China’s military developments\nand lack of transparency in its defense budget (US Depart-\nment of Defense 2013). This could be seen by China as questioning the \nsincerity of the rhetoric of “peaceful rise” that underpinned its pledge \nto be a responsible power in the international community. Specifically, \nthe Obama administration was alarmed by China’s military activities \nrelating to its territorial disputes with other Asian countries in the South \nand East China Seas. While the official US position on the question \n', '358 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nof sovereignty was neutral, Obama emphasized America’s treaty obligations\nto support its regional allies such as Japan and the Philippines \n(Felsenthal and Spetalnick 2014). In this sense, Obama’s narratives on \nthe US “pivot” to Asia or rebalancing strategy could be viewed as a \nnecessary step of exercising US leadership in building a liberal order in \nthe Asia-Pacific (Bumiller 2011; Clinton 2011). In US narratives, China \nwas characterized as a rising power with an undemocratic system, growing\nmilitary capabilities, and revisionist intentions that would seriously \nundermine peace and stability in the international order. Consequently, \nthe best way to guarantee China’s “peaceful rise” was to support the \nrule of law and advocate greater freedom of expression and religious \nfreedom in the country and gradually integrate China into the US-led \nLIO. Here the Obama administration’s “speech acts” could be seen as \nwhat Nicholas Onuf would consider “an activity with normative consequences”\n(Onuf 2001, 77).\nIndeed, the dominant narratives of the role of the United States in \nthe world on the basis of its political values were prevalent among US \nelites during the Obama era. A prime example of this was the publication\nof a report prepared by a bipartisan task force of foreign policy \nand national security experts.4 The report argued that the United States’ \nglobal role should be based on the belief that “the advancement of an \nopen, rules-based international order that promotes universal values of \nliberty, democracy, human dignity, and economic freedom is essential to \nthe security and economic vitality of the United States” (Goldgeier and \nVolker 2013, 2). Similarly, a 2014 Brookings report recommended that \nPresident Obama’s overarching foreign policy goal in the remainder of \nhis second term should be “to reassert American leadership in a rulesbased\ninternational system in which norms are not only articulated but \nalso, wherever possible, enforced” (Kagan and Piccone 2014). Another \nreport produced by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace \nsupported a policy of democracy promotion and the Obama administration’s\nefforts to rebuild America’s democratic reputation following the \ndecline in US standing as the champion of democracy under the Bush \nadministration (Carothers 2012). This indicated that the perception of \nUS leaders on the centrality of liberal values and norms to America’s \nnational identity and the international order was widely shared by its \nelites.5\nWhile agreeing that US interests can be secured through the exercise\nof its global leadership role, many US leaders believe that the Unit-\ned States’ preeminent position in the world is best preserved by maintaining\nits military superiority over other great powers. This would help \n', 'Rex Li 359\nprevent rising powers such as China from challenging US preeminence. \nAmerica should therefore support multilateralism but be prepared to act \nunilaterally if this is needed for the protection of US interests. The discourse\nand practice of US foreign policy under the George W. Bush \npresidency were a clear reflection of this perspective. Although Obama \nwas much more enthusiastic about tackling global and regional issues \nthrough multilateral means, the preservation of US military power remains\na significant part of his narratives of America’s role in uphold-\ning the US-led LIO. When Obama spoke on the Asia-Pacific region in \n2011, he made it clear that “we will allocate the resources necessary to \nmaintain our strong military presence in this region” and that “we will \npreserve our unique ability to project power and deter threats to peace.” \nHe also indicated that the United States was modernizing its defense \nposture across the Asia-Pacific with greater flexibility and new capabilities\n“to ensure that our forces can operate freely” and to help “allies and \npartners build their capacity, with more training and exercises” (Obama \n2011). Obama’s power narratives were articulated in his address at the \nUN General Assembly in 2013: “The United States of America is prepared\nto use all elements of our power, including military force, to se-\ncure our core interests” (Obama 2013).\nIt was apparent that Obama sought to maintain a liberal unipolar \nsystem or what G. John Ikenberry has called a “one-hub” international \nsystem with America at the center (Ikenberry 2011b). This system is \nbased on a liberal order that is best seen as “an organizational complex \nin which the United States is the organisational hub” (Ikenberry 2011b, \n242). In this metanarrative, US unipolarity was established on the basis\nof not only US economic and military power but an American-led \nopen and rule-based global system, which could be joined by other great \npowers. What distinguished Obama from other US presidents was that \nhe was more willing to involve other countries and engage adversaries \nin the exercise of US leadership. This is evidenced by the proposal of \nbuilding a multipartner world presented by Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton in 2009 (Clinton 2009). This type of global leadership reflected \nObama’s conception of America’s identity as a benign hegemon, which \naspired to build an LIO under US leadership with the cooperation and \nparticipation of other countries. It is a recurring theme in his “speech \nacts”: “We stand for an international order in which the rights and responsibilities\nof all nations and all people are upheld. Where interna-\ntional law and norms are enforced. Where commerce and freedom of \nnavigation are not impeded. Where emerging powers contribute to regional\nsecurity, and where disagreements are resolved peacefully. That’s \nthe future that we seek” (Obama 2011).\n', '360 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nChina’s Counternarratives—Liberal  \nInternational Order with Chinese  \nCharacteristics?\nObama’s vision and mission of sustaining establishing an American-led \nLIO was welcomed by many US friends and allies, including those in \nEast Asia. However, America’s narratives of the international order in \nthe Obama years and their manifestation in US foreign policy caused \nconsiderable apprehension in China. While China benefited substantially\nfrom the existing international economic order, it was concerned \nabout the political and ideological challenge of US liberal unipolarity. \nObama’s decision to fortify US relations with other democratic countries\nin the Asia-Pacific, such as India, Japan, South Korea, and Austra-\nlia, on the basis of common values was viewed by China as a move to \nundermine its moral and political authority as a regional leader and a \nkey player in the LIO (Ma 2016).\nBetween 1989 when the Cold War ended and 2008 with the beginning\nof the global financial crisis, Chinese scholars and policy elites \nengaged in a rigorous debate on what path China should follow in pursuing\nits great power status, and how it should relate itself to the outside \nworld (Li 2009). While many Chinese analysts were apprehensive of \nthe security intentions of the United States and Japan, their discourse \non China’s position in the international system in relation to other major \npowers was rather subdued. They recommended a nonconfrontational \napproach to handling great power relations and territorial disputes with \nother Asian countries. However, this identity discourse began to change \nin 2008 when the global financial crisis seriously undermined the economic\nstrengths of many of the dominant players in the world economy. \nWhile the United States and other Western powers were still struggling \nto revive their economies, China had recovered from the financial crisis. \nThe Chinese economy achieved an impressive growth rate of 8.7 percent\nin 2009 (BBC News 2010).\nThe Chinese economy continued to grow after 2009, which enabled\nChina to strengthen its trade relations with neighboring countries \nand expand its international influence. Following the global economic \ndownturn, Chinese elites were much more confident in arguing for the \ncase of alternative development models including the Chinese model. \nThey suggested that China needed to create the kind of environment that \nwould assist it in fulfilling its great power aspirations (Cai 2010; Pan \n2010). China’s swift recovery from the global financial crisis that continued\nto hit many countries across the world boosted Chinese confidence \n', 'Rex Li 361\nand led to a reassessment of the global strategic environment. To many \nChinese analysts, America’s weakened position and China’s continued \nrise were a clear indication of the changing global balance of power. \nThey began to produce the narratives that advocated the adoption of a \nmore proactive and assertive international strategy. While appreciating \nthe rationale behind Deng Xiaoping’s motto “hiding our capabilities and \nbiding our time” (tao guang yang hui), they argued that China should be \nmore active in “accomplishing something” (you suo zuo wei) in a propitious\ninternational environment and have the ambition of “striving for \nachievement” (fenfa you wei) in Chinese foreign policy (Xu 2014; Zhao \nT. 2015).6 China’s attempts to establish itself as a sea power or a “strong \nmaritime power” (haiyang qiangguo) could be seen as an indispensable \npart of constructing its identity as a global power that would be capable \nof protecting and expanding its regional and global interests (Li 2016).\nWhen Xi Jinping became the top leader of China in 2012, he wasted \nno time in promoting his vision of the “China Dream” (Zhongguo meng) \nor the “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” (Zhonghua minzu fuxing). \nAt a high-level foreign policy meeting in 2014, Xi outlined his strategic \nview of China’s great power diplomacy (daguo waijiao) in the changing \ninternational environment to a group of senior party and government officials\n(Xinhuanet 2014), which signified a clear policy departure from \nDeng Xiaoping’s guidance on “keeping a low profile” in international \naffairs. A major ambition of President Xi is to reappraise and redefine \nChina’s position in the current international order. Some Chinese elites \ncontend that the international order is intimately linked to the distribution\nand redistribution of power in the international system (Yan 2015). \nAs Chinese economic and military power grows, they argue, it is time \nfor China to make an effort to reshape the international order that has \nhitherto been driven and dominated by the United States (He 2017).\nIn the past few years there have been growing discussions on \nstrengthening of China’s “discursive power” (huayu quan) in international\nrelations in Chinese academic and policy circles (see, for example, \nZhao L. 2015). The publication of a major article on the importance and \nnecessity for China to compete with the West for “international discursive\npower” (guoji huayu quan) in Xuexi shibao indicates the high-level \nattention paid to the topic.7 This article has appeared subsequently on \nthe State Council Information Office’s website (Zhang 2017). According\nto the article, a country’s discursive power is not derived automat-\nically from its material power; it has to be cultivated and developed \nstrategically. Of all the areas in China’s competition with the West for \ndiscursive power, “political discursive power” (zhengzhi huayu quan) \n', '362 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nis believed to be the most significant one. This is the area where China \nis advised to increase its capability to thwart the “discourse offensive” \n(huayu gongji) from the West and shape the international discourse on \nmajor global issues and policy debates to its advantage. China’s emphasis\non the discursive rivalry with the West / United States reveals its \nunderstanding of the critical role of metanarratives in constructing the \nsocial world and constituting the perceived reality in international relations.\nAs Madam Fu Ying, a senior adviser to Xi Jinping, put it in 2015, \n“China . . . needs to come up with its own narratives to allow the world \nto read and understand China better” (Fu 2015).\nSpecifically, Chinese policy elites have been actively engaged \nin manufacturing their narratives of the international order. They believe\nthat it is crucial for China to “make its voices heard” (fachu ziji \nde shengyin) in the debate on the virtues and drawbacks of the “global\nliberal order” (quanqiu ziyou zhixu).8 Indeed, since the early 2010s \nthere has been a concerted Chinese effort to challenge the merits of the \nUS master narratives on the LIO and to produce Chinese counternarratives\non the international order that reflect China’s changing identity \ndiscourse, national aspirations, and expanding global influence. A recent \narticle published in the Chinese Communist Party’s flagship newspaper\nRenmin ribao (People’s Daily) under the pseudonym of Xuanyan \npresents a very powerful narrative on China’s position in the world in \nrelation to the changing international order (Xuanyan 2018).9 The article \ndeclared, “The drawbacks of capitalism-led political and economic systems\nare emerging; the global governance system is experiencing pro-\nfound changes and a new international order is taking shape.” It went on \nto say how China had contributed to the solution of the common problems\nencountered by humankind through “Chinese wisdom” (Zhongguo \nzhihui) and “Chinese solutions” (Zhongguo fang an), which was widely \nrecognized in the world. Thus, the narratives continued, “China has become\nan important source and stabilizer for world economic growth, as \nwell as an important guardian and advocate of world peace and development\nand human civilization and progress.” The article asserted that \nChina was “more confident and more competent than any time in history \nto grasp this opportunity.”\nIt is this level of confidence that has led China to actively advocate \nreform of the existing international order. To Chinese leaders and elites, \nit is only natural for rising powers to advocate their preferred conceptions\nof the world order, which was exactly what the United States and \nthe former Soviet Union did after World War II. Despite their criticism \nof the LIO, Chinese leaders have not rejected all the key components \n', 'Rex Li 363\nof the US-/Western-dominated international order. Rather, they have \nembraced certain aspects of the LIO arguing that China is willing and \nable to make a positive contribution to the reform of the international \nsystem. Indeed, Chinese policy elites (whether they are Realists or Liberals)\nhave advocated the idea that China should be actively involved in \nthe reform and reconstruction of the existing international order (Wang \n2015; Yan 2015).\nThe dominant Chinese narratives suggest that China does not intend\nto create a new international order to replace the present one. As \nAmbassador Fu Ying said, China “achieved leapfrog growth within the \nexisting international order and China’s future opportunities for development\ncome from it.”10 If anything, this international order is believed \nto have offered China “the platform for exercising greater international \nrole.” Thus, China “has every reason to continue supporting and participating\nin the international order and system.” While it is necessary to \n“improve,” “update,” or “reshape” the international system and international\ngovernance, she maintains, “reforming does not mean discarding \neverything or complete replacement” (Fu 2015). Indeed, Xi Jinping has \nexpressed his commitments to “upholding the international order and \nthe international system” that are based on “the purposes and principles \nof the UN Charter” (Xi 2015b). In his keynote address at the opening \nof the 2018 Boao Forum for Asia in April 2018, Xi used the occasion to \ncommunicate the narratives that China would not “attempt to overturn \nthe existing international system,” and that it would “stay as determined \nas ever to build world peace, contribute to global prosperity and uphold \nthe international order” (Xi 2018a). Similarly, in a signed article published\nin a Spanish newspaper ahead of his state visit to Spain in No-\nvember 2018, Xi reiterated his narratives to the European audience that \nChina would work with Spain to “uphold multilateralism and free trade, \nand jointly contribute to improving and safeguarding the international \norder” (Xi 2018b).\nIn China’s counternarratives of the current LIO, two particular areas \nare believed to be in need of reform. The first area is the US/Western \nemphasis on the central role of liberal ideology in the international order.\nClearly, China’s political ideology and political system are funda-\nmentally different from those of the United States. The liberal values \nunderscored in American narratives are precisely the values that are \ncontested by the Chinese government. While US identity is built on such \nvalues as freedom, democracy, and liberty and the notion of American \nexceptionalism, the construction of China’s national identity is closely \nassociated with the renewal of the Chinese nation and Chinese cultural \n', '364 Contending Narratives of the International Order\ntraditions. The divergence in their identity discourse has become much \nmore conspicuous in the past decade, which has influenced their different\nconceptions of and preferences for the future world order.\nTo Chinese leaders, the definition of a “liberal” regime is defined \nby the United States according to its values and criteria. As such, the \nUS conception of the LIO is said to be ideologically driven. In China’s \ncounternarratives, an international order built on the division of “liberal”\nand “nonliberal” countries is based on the rules of a zero-sum game \nthat has become obsolete. They contend that this division was exploited \nby US leaders to justify its hegemonic activities such as the 2003 invasion\nof Iraq that blatantly violated the UN Charter. As stated by a for-\nmer Chinese vice-foreign minister, this type of ideologically motivated, \nWestern-dominated discourse and narrative on the international order \nis an “extension of the Cold War mentality” (lengzhan siwei de yanxu), \nand the meaning of the “global liberal order” (quanqiu ziyou zhixu) \nshould not be defined solely by the United States, which is against the \nfundamental principles of democracy (He 2017).\nThis is why the demands for respect for different cultures, civilizations,\nand social and political systems figure prominently in Chinese \nnarratives on the international order. As Xi Jinping put it in his 2015 \nspeech to the United Nations General Assembly, “Each civilization represents\nthe unique vision and contribution of its people, and no civiliza-\ntion is superior to others. . . . The principle of sovereignty . . . means that \nall countries’ right to independently choose social systems and development\npaths should be upheld” (Xi 2015a). The same narratives were \nrepeated in Xi’s 2017 speech in Geneva. To “establish a fair and equitable\ninternational order,” he maintained, “the sovereignty and dignity of \nall countries . . . must be respected, there must not be any interference \ninto their internal affairs” (Xi 2017a). The future world order, according \nto one senior Chinese academic, should “accommodate more political, \neconomic and cultural diversity than the current one that has been dominated\nby Western values and culture” (Wu 2018).\nAnother area for reform in China’s counternarratives of the LIO \nis the inequitable distribution of power in a range of international institutions.\nIn particular, emerging powers and developing countries are \nbelieved to be underrepresented in the decision-making process of such \ninstitutions as the UN, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World \nBank. This point was made specifically by Xi Jinping in his 2017 Geneva\nspeech: “All countries should jointly shape the future of the world, \nwrite international rules, manage global affairs and ensure that development\noutcomes are shared by all” (Xi 2017a). China’s narratives of \n', 'Rex Li 365\nan ideal international order tend to emphasize equality among all nations\nregardless of their size, wealth, and power. As Xi argues, “Coun-\ntries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are all equal members \nof the international community . . . they are entitled to participate in \ndecision-making, enjoy rights and fulfil obligations on an equal basis. \nEmerging markets and developing countries deserve greater representation\nand voice” (Xi 2017a). The international order, Chinese leaders and \nelites contend, should be built upon the principles of “democratization \nof international relations” (guoji guanxi minzhuhua), “mutual respect” \n(xianghu zunzhong), and “win-win cooperation” (hezuo gong ying).11\nIn Chinese narratives, the reform of global governance (quanqiu \nzhili) is an essential part of reshaping the international order (chongsu \nguoji zhixu) (He 2017). Following the advice of some leading Chinese \nforeign affairs experts, Xi Jinping has stressed the need for China to \nmake a greater effort to “promote the reform of the unjust and inequitable\narrangements within the existent global governance system” (Xi \n2016). He has also called for the “strengthening of the theoretical study \nof global governance” and the “training of the specialist personnel” in \nthis area (Xi 2015b). Indeed, Xi has assiduously articulated the narratives\nof his vision of the international order in various domestic and \nglobal forums. In his report at the Chinese Communist Party’s Nineteenth\nNational Congress in October 2017, he said that China would \n“continue to . . . take an active part in reforming and developing the \nglobal governance system, and keep contributing Chinese wisdom and \nstrength to global governance” (Xi 2017c). At a high-level government \nmeeting in February 2017, Xi reportedly stated for the first time that \nChina should “guide” (yindao) the international community in “shaping\na new international order that is more just and equitable” and in \n“maintaining international security” (Studying China 2017). The report \naffirmed that China has both the qualifications (zige) and ability (nengli) \nto provide leadership for a new international order.12\nIt is within this narrative context that China has launched the BRICS \nDevelopment Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), \nand the “One Belt, One Road” initiative. These initiatives clearly indicate\nChina’s discontent with the existing rules and regulations of vari-\nous US-dominated international institutions. With its growing economic \npower and political clouts, China is evidently seeking to reshape various \naspects of the international order. As Suisheng Zhao points out, the accession\nof the European countries to the AIIB “was seen as a powerful \ntestament to China’s role in the reconstruction of global governance” \n(Zhao 2018, 648). The “Belt and Road” project may be created to build \n', '366 Contending Narratives of the International Order\ninfrastructure links across central and South Asia toward Europe and \nAfrica and to develop new markets in all these areas. But this initiative \ncould be viewed as a way of laying the material foundation for China \nto construct an alternative global order in the future (Nordin and Weissmann\n2018).\nIndeed, China is increasingly vocal in articulating its conception \nof a future global order based on “Chinese wisdom.” Essentially, Chinese\nchallenge to America’s master narratives on the LIO is its failure to \nrecognize the substantial changes in the global economy within which \nChina and other emerging and developing countries have been playing \na much more significant role. Another alleged flaw in America’s LIO \nnarratives is its preoccupation with the liberal ideology, which is seen to \nbe far too restrictive. Chinese leaders and elites are aiming to generate \ntheir counternarratives that go beyond US/Western liberal values to encompass\nmany common values of the countries around the world. They \nbelieve that China has both the credentials and capability of providing \nleadership for such a new international order. The concept of “working \ntogether to construct a community of human destiny” (gongtong goujian\nrenlei mingyun gongtongti) as a “Chinese solution” to the world’s \ncomplex problems is designed to gain the moral high ground in contesting\nUS discursive power. \nIn 2008 G. John Ikenberry argued that “the United States cannot \nthwart China’s rise, but it can help ensure that China’s power is exercised\nwithin the rules and institutions that the United States and its part-\nners have crafted over the last century” (Ikenberry 2008). Ten years on, \nChina has redefined its great power identity, and Chinese narratives of \nthe international order certainly suggest that it is now seeking to revise \nthe rules and restructure the institutions originally set up by the United \nStates and its allies. In a highly contentious article, Kurt Campbell and \nEly Ratner, two members of the Obama administration, argued that “the \nliberal international order has failed to lure or bind China as powerfully \nas expected” and that “the gap between American expectations and Chinese\nrealities has grown” (Campbell and Ratner 2018, 61, 69).13\nIt appears that China has succeeded in promoting its counternarratives\nwithin the parameter of America’s master narratives. As the US \nnarratives of the international order have been normalized or naturalized \nfor decades, it is difficult for China to act completely outside of the \ndiscursive boundary established by America. After all, China has benefitted\nsubstantially from the LIO in building up its great power status \nand capabilities. Chinese leaders’ pledge to uphold the existing international\norder while challenging or rejecting certain elements of it seems \n', 'Rex Li 367\nan effective way of countering the metanarratives of the US-led LIO. In \nmany ways, the US master narratives offer some useful “guidance” and \na “sense of direction” for Chinese leaders in constructing their counternarratives.\nThus, China is able to contest America’s master narra-\ntives without supporting its “hegemonic power-knowledge complexes” \n(Damberg 2004, 360).\nThe Effects of the US-China Discursive Rivalry \non the United Kingdom\nThe analysis in preceding sections clearly revealed an intense discursive \ncompetition between the United States and China in relation to their \nnarratives of the (liberal) international order. The ultimate goal of a state \nin constructing and spreading particular narratives of its “reality” is to \nmake them attracted to and accepted by third parties as well as its domestic\naudiences, with the likelihood of shaping their perceptions and \nbehaviors that would serve the state’s interests. If narratives can produce \nsuch effects, then the state may be able to turn its discursive power to actual\npower. This is why Nicholas Onuf argues that “speaking” in foreign \npolicy is “an activity with normative consequences” (Onuf 2001, 77). \nThis section considers the effects of the US-China discursive rivalry \non the United Kingdom, focusing specifically on whether and to what \nextent the competing US/Chinese narratives of the international order \nhas the capacity of shaping the United Kingdom’s values and interests.\nIt is worth noting that the United Kingdom played a significant role \nin building the post-1945 LIO, which can be traced to the signing of \nthe Atlantic Charter between President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime \nMinister Winston Churchill in August 1941. This joint declaration is \nwidely believed to have set out the liberal principles of the LIO. Thus, \nthe United States and United Kingdom share the fundamental values \nthat underpin the rules and norms of the international system, including \nmultilateralism, free trade, international law, human rights, and so on. \nHowever, since the election of Donald Trump as US president, the United\nStates seems to be abandoning its leadership role in the LIO. With his \n“America First” foreign policy orientation, President Trump has shown \na hostile attitude toward some traditional liberal values (Schake 2018; \nWolf 2018). Unlike the Trump administration, the British government \nhas not displayed any inclination to retreat from liberal internationalism \ndespite the UK’s decision to withdraw from the European Union. On \nthe contrary, Prime Minister Theresa May has passionately defended the \n', '368 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nkey values of the LIO. Some of her statements are reminiscent of the US \nnarratives of the international order in the Obama era.\nIn her speech to the Lord Mayor’s Banquet in November 2017, Theresa\nMay emphasized the common values that were shared by the Unit-\ned Kingdom and the United States and other European countries, and \nthe importance of supporting an international rules-based system, free \nmarkets, and fair societies. She spoke of the need to “defend the rules \nbased international order against irresponsible states that seek to erode \nit” as a “task of a global Britain” (May 2017b). In spite of her disagreement\nwith Trump on climate change, free trade and other issues, she \nbelieved that the “role of the United States in shaping the global order is \nas vital now as it has ever been,” and that the US-UK relationship is underpinned\nby “an alliance of values and interests” between the peoples \nof the two countries. While recognizing that the LIO “is in danger of being\neroded,” May affirmed that the United Kingdom was determined to \n“secure the best possible Brexit deal” that “strengthens the liberal values \nwe hold dear.” In the meantime, she maintained, the United Kingdom \nwould work with other countries “to adapt and defend the rules based \norder on which our security and prosperity depends” (May 2017b).\nIn her speech delivered to the World Economic Forum in Davos in \nJanuary 2017, May reiterated her strong belief “in a rules based global \norder” and urged the international community to “maintain” and “build” \nsupport “for the rules-based international system” (May 2017a). In fact, \nher vision of building “a truly Global Britain” after Brexit is firmly rooted\nin the LIO. In particular, she champions the liberal values of free \ntrade and multilateralism. May insists that the United Kingdom is “by \ninstinct a great, global, trading nation,” and that it embraces “genuine \nfree trade” which is “the basis of our prosperity” and “the best way to \ncement the multilateral partnerships and cooperation that help to build \na better world.” She has argued that a post-Brexit Britain will “become \neven more global and internationalist in action and in spirit too.” While \nthis is in stark contrast to the trade policy of the Trump administration, \nthe United Kingdom has no intention to take over America’s leading \nrole in the international order. Instead, it seeks to “play a full role in \nunderpinning and strengthening the multilateral rules-based system,” to \n“uphold the institutions that enable the nations of the world to work \ntogether,” and to “continue to promote international cooperation” (May \n2017a). \nAs a major Western liberal democracy, the United Kingdom’s ideological\nposition is undoubtedly closer to that of the United States. After \nall, the United Kingdom and the United States have collaborated closely \n', 'Rex Li 369\nto build and sustain the post–World War II international order. Certainly,\nthere have been strains on their “special relationship” and the two \ncountries have had different positions on specific issues such as the Suez \ncrisis, the Vietnam War, and the Libyan operation in the Obama era. The \nUnited States does see Britain’s role in the world primarily as part of the \nEuropean project and a leading member of the Atlantic alliance rather \nthan a world power. That was why Obama made an exceptionally unusual\nintervention during the United Kingdom’s referendum campaign \nby publicly supporting David Cameron’s position on remaining in the \nEU (Kuenssberg 2016). Nevertheless, there are more convergences than \ndivergences in the narratives on the LIO in the United States and United \nKingdom. As Thomas Raines, head of the Europe Programme at Chatham\nHouse, puts it, “If Britain has had a ‘grand strategy’ in the post-\nCold War period, it is to support, sustain and strengthen a so-called liberal\ninternational order—the expansion of democracy and free markets, \nthe growth in multilateral institutions and the development of international\nlaw.” The distinctiveness of the United Kingdom’s worldview, he \nargues, is that “Britain has a unique contribution to make to this global \norder,” and that “it ought to be at the top table, or punching above its \nweight” (Raines 2018/2019, 31, 32).\nIndeed, British politicians have become more active in the past few \nyears in generating their narratives of the international order through various\nofficial channels including the debates in Parliament. The majority \nof the parliamentarians agree on the need to maintain and strengthen the \nLIO in the face of the challenges of rising populism, Brexit, and illiberal \nforces from Russia and other countries (House of Lords 2017; House of \nCommons 2018). As Baroness Anelay of St Johns stated in a House of \nLords debate, “The rules-based international order is clearly fundamental\nto our security and prosperity. We will face challenges. Noble Lords \nhave reflected carefully on them. However, I am confident that, working \nwith our key friends and allies and with the support of British parliamentarians\nin both Houses, we can navigate the development of a more \nresilient, inclusive international order over the coming years in line with \nour values and interests” (House of Lords 2017).\nHowever, this liberal consensus seems to be dwindling in British politics.\nSome Conservative politicians are supportive of “a harder-nosed, \nmore interest-driven policy” in the areas of aid, climate change, and \nimmigration (Raines 2018/2019, 32). It appears that the Conservative \nParty has been able to absorb many followers of the UK Independence \nParty (UKIP), the right-wing political party whose mission is to take the \nUK out of the EU. But this could push the Conservative Party toward the \n', '370 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nantiliberal direction that could undermine some key values of the LIO. \nEqually challenging is the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn, an outspoken \ncritic of the multilateral institutions championed by liberal supporters, \nas the leader of the Labour Party. For decades, Corbyn has been critical \nof US foreign policy and the role of NATO. In a recent foreign policy \nspeech at the Chatham House, Corbyn contended that “the approach to \ninternational security we have been using since the 1990s has simply \nnot worked.” He expressed strong opposition to the wars in Afghanistan,\nIraq, Libya, and Syria as well as Western military interventions in \nSomalia and Yemen, although he accepted that “military action, under \ninternational law and as a genuine last resort, is in some circumstances \nnecessary.” He said that “a Labour government will want a strong and \nfriendly relationship with the United States. But we will not be afraid to \nspeak our mind. . . . Waiting to see which way the wind blows in Washington\nisn’t strong leadership.” He declared that “a Labour government \nwill conduct a robust and independent foreign policy—made in Britain”\n(Corbyn 2017). The world order narratives presented by Corbyn \nare clearly not the same as the narratives shared by many other British \npoliticians in both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. Yet it is \npossible for Corbyn to become the next British prime minister given the \nextensive grassroots support for his policy as indicated by the results of \nthe 2017 general election.\nThe challenge for the May government is that she is facing enormous\nchallenges from her party, Parliament, and the country to fulfil \nher vision of “Global Britain.” A recent opinion poll revealed that the \nBritish public remained deeply divided in their views on Brexit, with 47 \npercent of the population still preferring to leave the EU (NatCen 2018). \nThis is not a positive sign for Global Britain and the LIO that May seeks \nto promote.\nIronically, if we look at the speeches given by President Xi and \nPrime Minister May in 2017, it appears that the two leaders have much \nin common in their global economic outlooks in that they both expressed \ntheir appreciation of the positive impact of free trade and economic globalization\non the people across the world. May recognized the need to \n“ensure free trade and globalisation work for everyone” (May 2017a) \nand to “deliver fair and equitable growth for all” (May 2017b), while Xi \nargued that “we should strike a balance between efficiency and equity \nto ensure that different countries, different social strata and different \ngroups of people all share in the benefits of economic globalization” (Xi \n2017a). Both leaders advocated multilateral cooperation, although Xi \nwent further to suggest that all countries should be “entitled to partici-\n', 'Rex Li 371\npate in decision-making, enjoy rights and fulfill obligations on an equal \nbasis,” and that “emerging markets and developing countries deserve \ngreater representation and voice” (Xi 2017a). The UK seems amenable\nto China’s narratives on promoting a more equitable international \nsystem and reforms in global governance. Indeed, May acknowledges \nthat “global economic growth is increasingly being driven by emerging \neconomies and powerhouses in the East,” and that “the West cannot \nwrite the rules of this century on its own.” She has indicated that the \nUnited Kingdom will “work with partners in Africa, Asia and beyond in \nbuilding consensus and taking practical steps towards a global economy \nthat works for everyone” (May 2017b). \nIndeed, the United Kingdom and China have been able to cooperate\nin many areas, especially in trade and education. For example, the \nUnited Kingdom was the first Western country joining the AIIB established\nby China in 2015. The United Kingdom is China’s second largest \ntrade partner in Europe (€62 billion), and it is the EU’s top recipient for \nChinese foreign direct investment (€23 billion in 2016). Despite some \ninitial hesitation, the May government has approved the controversial \n€7 billion Hinckley Point nuclear plant, which will be heavily financed \nby Chinese investment. China has also invested in Thames Water, the \nHeathrow and Manchester airports, and various major British companies.\nMore recently, May indicated her commitment to maintaining the \n“Golden Era” of the UK’s relationship with China “as a vital trading \npartner” and “a fellow permanent member of the Security Council \nwhose decisions together with ours will shape the world around us” \n(May 2017b). In January 2018 the prime minister paid a high-profile \nvisit to China with a delegation of fifty British business leaders, which \nled to the signing of business deals worth some nine billion pounds to \nboth countries. Although May refused to offer a formal British endorsement\nof China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a UK bank that traveled with \nher raised the prospects of providing more than one billion pounds of \ncredit for the infrastructure project. May said that the United Kingdom \nwas considering “how we can build further on that golden era and on the \nglobal strategic partnership that we have been working on between the \nUK and China” (Deutsche Welle 2018). This was followed by another \nhigh-level visit in July 2018 by the UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt \nto China, where he discussed the possibility of a free trade agreement \nbetween the two nations. During his visit, Hunt commented that “the \nrise of China and China’s economy and Chinese power can and must be \na positive force in the world” (Kuo and Wintour 2018). Despite these \n', '372 Contending Narratives of the International Order\noptimistic words, the United Kingdom has not accepted China’s narratives\nof the international order without reservation. Although China \nand Britain share similar views on the need to tackle the challenge of \neconomic globalization and promote international cooperation, there remain\nfundamental differences in their political values and systems. \nMeanwhile, the increasingly close economic relationship between \nthe United Kingdom and China has given China the ability to exercise\nwhat Mikael Weissmann calls “disciplinary power” (Weissmann \n2018) in pressuring the United Kingdom to accept and adhere to China’s\npreferred narratives, especially in the light of the economic con-\ntext of Brexit. Given the difficulties in its trade negotiations with the \nEU for a post-Brexit deal, the British government is under immense \npressure to foster stronger trade relations with non-EU countries, particularly\nemerging economies like China and India. As the Spectator \nobserves, “a ground-breaking free-trade agreement between Britain and \nthe world’s ascendant superpower would be the great boon the UK government\nso desperately needs” (Auslin 2018). For the United Kingdom, \nthe disciplinary consequences of not accepting the Chinese narratives of \nthe international order could be rather significant, as it is facing much \nuncertainty in the post-Brexit international economic environment. One \nimportant component of China’s world order narratives is its insistence \non the principles of “non-interference into the internal affairs of other \ncountries” and “respect for each other’s national sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity.” This would no doubt include such issues as criticism \nof China’s human rights record, its territorial claims in the South China \nSea. There is ample evidence from Asia, Europe, and Australia showing \nhow China has been able to utilize its disciplinary power to coerce various\ncountries to accept the Chinese narratives through either rewards \nor punishments, or both (Auslin 2018; Brown 2018; Weissmann 2018).\nOn August 31, 2018, a Royal Navy warship sailed close to the Paracel\nIslands in the South China Sea to flex its military muscle in the re-\ngion. This was immediately challenged by a frigate and two helicopters \ndispatched by China (Graham and Nicholls 2018). The Chinese ministry \nof national defense protested and described the act as “a provocation \nand an infringement on Chinese sovereignty” (Zhang 2018). Britain’s \n“freedom of navigation” operations were condemned by Beijing as a \nmove “to seize whatever opportunity it can to get into Washington’s \ngood books” and “to revive the ‘special relationship’” with the United \nStates. An editorial in China Daily put it bluntly that the United Kingdom\ncould be “losing more than it can gain” as “it is no longer the \ngateway to continental Europe.” The editorial gave an explicit warning \n', 'Rex Li 373\nthat “China and the UK had agreed to actively explore the possibility \nof discussing a free trade agreement after Brexit, but any act that harms \nChina’s core interests will only put a spanner in the works” (China Daily \n2018).\nAs Lord Howell, a senior Conservative politician and chairman of \nthe House of Lords International Relations Committee, warns, “The \npower, wealth and ubiquitous influence of China itself leaves Britain \nnow no choice but to adjust its stance massively, for reasons of both \nprosperity and hard global strategy” (Howell 2018). The British leaders \nhave to decide on the extent to which it would accept the Chinese narratives\nof the international order and how they would write their “story” \nin the post-Brexit world. As Nicholas Onuf argues, “People use words \nto represent deeds and they can use words, and words alone, to perform\ndeeds” (Onuf 1989, 82). Thus, Kerry Brown cautions, “Ensure you \nknow the tale that you want to tell about yourself before you dally with \na country which will already be clear about the story that they have for \nyou” (Brown 2018, 31).\nGiven China’s capability and readiness to exert disciplinary power \nover the United Kingdom in influencing it to acquiesce to its narratives \nof the world order, more British politicians, commentators, and business\nleaders are becoming receptive to Chinese ideas and concepts. In \nthis sense, Chinese narratives may have some influence in shaping the \nUnited Kingdom’s interests. However, the available evidence suggests \nthat the United Kingdom is apprehensive toward China’s narratives of \nthe international order. While British leaders appreciate the necessity to \nreform the architecture of the current international system and update \nthe rules of multilateral institutions to make them more effective and \ninclusive, they are troubled by China’s geopolitical ambition that underpins\nits metanarratives of a “harmonious world.” This is why May was \nreluctant to endorse the Belt and Road Initiative officially when she was \nin Beijing in January 2018.\nBehind China’s benevolent narrative of “working together to build a \ncommunity of shared future for mankind,” the United Kingdom detects \nits nationalist mission of realizing the “China dream” in a “new era” \nthat is intended to make China a global power in the twenty-first century.\nPerhaps the most significant concern for British leaders and policy \nelites is the repression as an expression of China’s one-party system and \nits communist ideology (Khan 2017; Phillips 2017). In this sense, it is \ndifficult for the Chinese narratives of the international order to have any \nmeaningful effects on the United Kingdom’s liberal democratic values. \nAs Allan, Vucetic, and Hopf (2018) argue, China is unlikely to lead a \n', '374 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nsuccessful counterhegemonic challenge to the LIO, as its authoritarian \nidentity conflicts with the democratic ideology of other great powers \nwithin the current order. The LIO may not be functioning as it should, \nbut what is needed, in the words of the British diplomat Laura Clarke, \nis “a reinvigoration of the values that underpin it” (Clarke 2018). In the \npost-Brexit and Trump era when many of the liberal values are being \nquestioned or challenged, the British government has not abandoned \nthese values. Rather, it remains committed to strengthening “the liberal\nvalues we hold dear” (May 2017b) and defending the rules-based \ninternational order that was constructed in partnership with the United \nStates and other European countries. However, given the volatility in \nUK politics and the growing xenophobic sentiment among the British \npublic, it is difficult to predict the extent to which this commitment can \nbe sustained. \nConclusion\nThis article has explored how US and Chinese leaders and policy elites \nhave employed specific narratives to construct and advocate their different\nconceptions and visions of the international order. It seeks to make \na distinctive contribution to the extant literature on US-China relations, \nwhich tends to focus heavily on the material dimensions of international \nrelations such as economic strength and military power. Specifically, the \narticle contributes to the literature on the theorization of master/counternarratives\nin an IR context by providing empirical evidence from the \nUS-China discursive rivalry. Our analysis of the discursive battle between\nthe two great powers demonstrates that both the United States \nand China have exploited their adeptly constructed narratives of the international\norder to assert their power and influence in international af-\nfairs. Drawing upon the insights of discourse analysis and constructivist \ntheory, the article reveals how the particular narratives of the two countries\nreflect their different national identity, political ideology, national \nstrategy, and future ambitions.\nMy analysis of the US narratives of the LIO during the Obama \nadministration clearly indicates the significance of these narratives in \nreinforcing America’s power and its global leadership role in the international\nsystem. Similarly, the Chinese narratives in the Xi Jinping era \nreveal China’s strong desire to move beyond its previous position of \nkeeping a low-profile to exert greater influence on the future direction \nof the world order. Behind the intense US-China discursive competi-\n', 'Rex Li 375\ntion lies an ambitious objective of shaping the nature and structure of \nthe international order. For many years, the United States was able to \ndominate the master narratives of the LIO, which helped rationalize and \nlegitimize US hegemony. Since 2010 this has been contested by Chinese \nleaders and elites who have actively produced their counternarratives of \nthe world order, arguing and pushing for the restructuring of the existing \ninternational order and reforms in global governance that would reflect \nChina’s perspectives and interests.\nIf the outside world was unsure about how to interpret China’s ambiguous\ndiscourse of its relationship with the existing world order in the \nearly 2010s (Breslin 2013), the narratives analyzed in this article clearly\nunveil a more coherent Chinese vision of an alternative order, one \nthat China is confident it can shape and lead. This has presented a huge \nchallenge to the United States and the West at a time when the LIO is in \ndeep crisis. The resurgence of populism and nationalist and xenophobic \nsentiments in America and across Europe, coupled with Trump’s disdain \nfor the liberal norms and institutions, have shaken the foundation of the \nLIO. This provides fertile ground for China to advocate its version of \nthe LIO and project itself as the patron and leader of a new international \norder.\nThis article has assessed the impact of the contending US/Chinese \nnarratives on the United Kingdom, a close ally of the United States but \nan important trade partner of China. Our findings indicate that while the \nUnited Kingdom accepts the need for reforming the US-led LIO, Chinese\nworld order narratives appear to hold little attraction. There is no \nevidence showing that China’s discursive power has increased in terms \nof its capacity to shape the values and interests of the United Kingdom. \nDespite its reservations about President Trump’s foreign policy, the \nBritish government remains a firm supporter of the liberal values that \nunderpin the LIO. If anything, it has sought to play a significant role in \nsustaining the liberal world order when the current US administration \nhas effectively abdicated as the leader of the postwar LIO. However, \nas discussed earlier, this would be a very difficult task for the UK government\ngiven the uncertain political and economic environment after \nBrexit.\nMeanwhile, one should be aware that China’s narratives of the international\norder have attracted much more attention from the international \ncommunity in the past few years, particularly from developing countries.\nTrump’s “America First” policy in various areas such as interna-\ntional trade, climate change, and human rights has seriously undermined \nthe position of the United States and the liberal values underpinning \n', '376 Contending Narratives of the International Order\nUS global leadership. While the LIO is facing unprecedented challenges,\nChina has stepped up its efforts in generating and disseminating its \ncounternarratives of the international order which, combined with its \ngrowing economic power and “disciplinary power,” may become more \nacceptable to a wider range of countries. If this were to happen, China’s \ndiscursive power could be transformed into real power with profound \nimplications for the future international order, global peace, and stability.\nThis is an ongoing and immensely important issue that should \nbe closely observed by both scholars and policymakers in the coming \nyears. \nNotes\nRex Li is Reader in International Relations and Director of East Asian Security and \nPeace Project, Liverpool John Moores University, UK.

I am indebted to Alastair Iain Johnston for drawing my attention to this point. \nFollowing the discussion with Johnston, I used the keywords “liberal international \norder” to search three elite American newspapers, the New York Times, Wall Street \nJournal, and Washington Post, via Factiva. The results clearly indicated that the \nterm LIO has been mentioned more frequently in these newspapers only since 2000, \nparticularly in the past ten years.\n', 'Rex Li 377\n3.

It is important to point out that this task force was a self-selected, independent\ngroup trying to influence the policies of the Obama administration during his \nsecond term.\n5. But these reports may be seen as somewhat critical of Obama in his first term \nfor not doing enough on the democracy agenda.\n6. Yan Xuetong, the prominent realist international relations scholar at Tsinghua\nUniversity, has used the theory of moral realism to show how China’s strategy \nof “striving for achievement” (fenfa you wei) has been successful in enhancing its \npolitical legitimacy as a rising power and shaping a favorable international environment\nfor China to achieve its “national rejuvenation” (minzu fuxing). See Yan \n(2014).\n7. Xuexi shibao or Study Times is an open-source newspaper published by the \nParty School of the Chinese Communist Party.\n8. See, for example, He (2017).

In the Chinese lexicon, “democratization of international relations” (guoji \nguanxi minzhuhua) means that decision making in international relations should not \nbe monopolized by the great powers (read the United States here). The term “mutual \nrespect” (xianghu zunzhong) implies that smaller countries or non-Western nations \ndeserve greater respect from the Western powers, especially the United States. Conceptually,\n“win-win cooperation” (hezuo gong ying) is closely linked to “mutual \nrespect” (xianghu zunzhong), both of which are designed to promote “mutually beneficial\nco-operation” in a more just and equitable international system. These Chi-\nnese concepts emphasize the importance of inclusiveness and cultural coexistence \nin pursuing the “common interests of mankind.”\n12. Here the “new” international order referred to a future international order \nthat would be reformed along the lines advocated by Xi Jinping.\n13.
