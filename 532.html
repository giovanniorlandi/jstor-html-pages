D. COCHRAN\nI have intimated in these stories\nthat the Automatic phone deal "was\nmerely a step toward other and big\nger deals ahead of us, and now Vic\ntor P. Lawson, publisher of the Daily\nNews, lifts the curtain aside to give\nup a wee bit of a peep at what\'s go\ning on behind it.\nLawson is, without doubt, the most\ninfluential newspaper publisher in\nChicago. His Daily News leads all\nqthers in circulation, is known as a\nhome and fireside paper and has al\nways been considered quite respecta\nble. About nine years ago, with the\neminently respectable Walter Fisher\nas the man in front, Lawson helped\nput over the unification ordinances,\nso-called, whereby all chance of mu\nnicipal ownership of street railways\nwas killed until these ordinances ex\npire in 1927.\nAnd now, with Walter Fisher\nagain as the man in front, all possi-\nMMttilMMMiaii', 'bility of telephone competition has\nbeen killed, with Lawson\'s open aid,\nand a body blow dealt to municipal\nownership of telephones.\nElated over his success in helping\nthe gigantic phone trust to-establish\nan absolute telephone monopoly in\nChicago, Lawson gives us a peep at\nwhat\'s coming next\nIn a Daily News editorial he says:\n"With the absorption by the Chicago\nTelephone company of the automatic\ntelephone system of the Illinois Tun\nnel company, Chicago perhaps has\nrid itself permanently of franchise\ngrants for competitive undertakings\nin the public utility field. \'\nThen he goes on to say: "UNIFI\nCATION of service is the goal toward\nwhich the Chicago public has long\nbeen working. The street railways\nhave been brought under one man\nagement, as have also the elevated\nrailroads. The next step is to bring\nthe two transportation systems to\ngether as a well co-ordinated whole.\nThe city\'s various gas companies\nhave been consolidated and so have\nthe electric light companies. The\ncity\'s great gas and electric light\ncorporations have not been united\nlegally, but they are subject to com\nmon financial control. It would be\nbetter if they were legally merged,\nprovided the terms of the merger\nwere proper. Intelligent supervision\nby official representatives of the peo\nple must be relied upon to secure\ngood service at fair rates."\nNow you can see what\'s coming.\nLawson tells us that the "next step is\nto bring the two transportation sys\ntems together as a well co-ordinated\nwhole." That means that the next\nunification job will be the welding\ntogether of the elevated and surface\nlines.\nI can almost hear Walter Fisher\nlicking his chops.\nAnd when this job is done, another\nnail will be driven in the coffin of\nmunicipal ownership. The people\nwere bunked in 1907, when provision\nwas made whereby the people\nMIGHT some day get municipal\n6wnership of the surface lines. FER\nHAPS. But President Busby testi\nfied last year that while the surface\nlines could have been bought for\n$55,00,0000 in 1907, under -the terms\nof the Fisher unification ordinance,\nthe price in 1915 was $145,000,000.\nOf course, Lawson\'s wily Walt-r\nhad worked it all out as the legal\nrepresentative of the people in 1907\nhow they would get the money to\nbuy the street railways. You will re\nmember the city gets 55 per cent of\nthe net\' profit And in eight years\nChicago saved up something like\n$16,000,000 .toward the purchase\nprice.\nBut in that eight years, under the\nFisher agreement, the price the city\nwould have to pay had jumped from\n$55,000,000 to $145,000,000, or\nNINETY MILLION DOLLARS.\nYOU can see what chance Chicago\nhas of ever buying the surface lines,\nwhen the purchase price jumps $11,\n000,000 every time we save $2,000,\n000. Now when we take the next step\nand add the millions of water in both\nsurface and elevated lines together,\nthe Lord only knows how many hun\ndreds of millions we\'ll have to pay in\norder to get municipal ownership.\nBut the public utility gang isn\'t go\ning to step there no siree Bob. The\nsecond step will be for the Common\nwealth Edison to swallow up Peoples\nGas.\nAs Lawson says, they "have not\nbeen united legally, but they are sub\nject to common financial control"\nYou bet they are, Vic, and that\ngoes for the Chicago Telephone Co.\nand the street railway as well as for\nCommonwealth Edison and Peoples\nGas.\nSam Insull is practically running\nthe whole public utility outfit, and\nthe Marshall Field estate octopus is\none of the biggest owners back of\nhim.\nThe game evidently is to get all\npf the public utilities of Chicago un- .', 'der one management, as they are\nnow practically under one owner\nship. Now read this again from the\nDaily News: "Intelligent supervision\nby official representatives of the peo\npe must be relied upon to secure\ngood service at fair rates."\nSounds good, but what chance will\nthe people have to get official repre\nsentatives who will protect their in\nterests, when such a gigantic public\nutility combine, with all of the banks\nand newspapers under its thumb, will\nbe THE REAL GOVERNMENT of\nChicago?\nI\'m for unification; all right, Vic,\nbut I\'m not for any skin game like\nthat. I wouldn\'t favor building up\nso vast a combination of dollars and\njobs that it could easily control gov\nernment and choose the "official rep\nresentatives" whose job it would be\nto secure good service at fair rates.\nFor that would mean that the Hog\nCombine would decide what was\ngood service and what would be fair\nrates.\nBy the way, have you noticed how\nregularly the public utility Hog Com\nbine is advertising in the newspapers\nnowadays.\nWatch your step!\no o\nALLIED AIR MEN DROP BOMBS\nON KRUPP GUN PLANT\nLondon, March 15.

Bar\nratt O\'Hara warned them in an ad\ndress before the Elgin Women\'s club\nthat the only reason they were not\nin the class of the offenders might\nbe solely because they hadn\'t been\nup against the same amount of eco\nnomic pressure.\n"It has been believed by most per\nsons," he said, "that justice should\nin its administration be tempered\nwith mercy and humanity; that the\nprinciple of an eye for an eye had\nbeen discarded in the progress of civ\nilization. "There has recently grown up,\nhowever, a group demanding the\nseparation of justice and humanity,\nboldly insisting upon the denial of\ncharity and kindness to those con\nvicted of crime. Newspapers are\nconstantly quoting now a prosecu\ntor, now a judge, now a police officer,\nnow a private citizen, as bitterly crit\nicizing what they are pleased to term\n\'soft-hearted and soft-brained\' treat\nment of persons who have fallen be\nyond the pall of society. They blame\nevery epidemic of crime upon this\n\'soft\' treatment of \'criminals.\'\n"I wonder if these persons who at\ntribute the prevalence of crime waves\nto charitable treatment of unfortu\nnate persons, even when accused of\ncrime, have ever paused to consider\nthat an overwhelming majority of\nthe men and women brought into\nour criminal courts come from the\nvery poorest strata of society, handi\ncapped even before birth by condi\ntions of hardship.\n"Do not mistake. There is no\nwilling criminal class. In dealing\nwith those accused of law violation\nyou are dealing with no strangers,\nbut with yourselves, as you might be\nif strong economic pressure had dis\ntorted vmir natural concentinns of\nright and wrong, or had interfered!\nwith the thinking and living of your\nparents before you, thus prenatally\ninfluencing you, as well as determin\ning your environment.\n"It is as essential in dealing with\nthose we term criminals that we let\nin all the humanity, all the charity,\nall the red-blooded and big-souled\nbrotherhood that we can muster, as\nit is to let in the sunshine and fresh\nair in dealing with physical sickness.\nIf the sunshine and fresh air had\nbeen there before the illness there\nmight not have been an illness. If\nthe humanity and the charity and\nbrotherhood had been revealed be\nfore the crime there might not have\nbeen a crime. Either preventative\nor remedially, they work, and if we\nare too late for the preventative use,\nthen let there be no hesitation in the\nremedial use.\n"Accept this as true: Crime waves\nnever come from kindness, but inva\nriably from the reverse. Those who\nargue differently generally argue\nsolely from ignorance. A few argue\nfrom viciousness, which would seem\nto put them in the criminal class\nthey delight to create and denounce."\nWOMEN ORGANIZE IN SIXTH\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT\nThe Congressional Union for Wom\nan Suffrage will hold its first meeting\nin the Sixth congressional district at\nthe home of Dr. Linslay Wynkoop,\n3406 Monroe st, at 2 p. m., Thurs\nday.

Chapman.)\n"Miss Flora Johnson, 28 Walden\nav.," read the line in the city direc\ntory, indicating that the owner of\nthe name was a business woman,\nwhich, in her small way, she indeed\nwas.\nThe little chronicle savored of\ncommercial establishment and inde\npendence, but in reality it covered\nthe drama of grim and sorrowful ex\nperience. At the address noted Flora\nJohnson lived in two poor rooms\nwith her mother, an invalid, her fa\nther dead and memories of a life of\ncomfort and contentment before Mr.\nJohnson had failed in business.\nThe old friends of Mr. Johnson al\nlowed his daughter to refer to them\nbut none of them offered a position.\nShe struggled through the initiation\nas a typist and stenographer and se\ncured a good position, but the house\nemploying her went out of business.\nShe had to take a poorer place, and\nthen misfortune seemed to pursue\nher. Her wages became smaller and\nsmaller, one of her employers aban\ndoned his office, a whole month\'s sal\nary m arrears, and at last Flora was\nforced to take up rapid-fire envelope\naddressing at a mere pittance. Her\nwardrobe was becoming shabby, but\nshe had no means of replenishing it\nShe was, indeed, dejected at times,\nalways, however, seeing that her\nmother was provided for. Flora -went\nhungry more than once at the man\ndates of a sordid necessity.\nThe heart of the mother was\ncheered, as just after 6 o\'clock had\nstruck she heard the quick step of\nher daughter coming up the stairs.\nShe fancied she caught the echo of\na glad, joyful laugh. All excitement,\nher usually pale cheeks red as a rose,\nFlora burst into the room, gayly\nwaving a letter\n"Oh, mother\'" she cried, "what do\nyou think? My luck has changed at 1\nlast I got this letter in the hall mail\nbox. It\'s for me and it\'s from a firm\ncalled Andre Fairfax & Co. I must\nhave answered some advertisement\nof theirs for a stenographer, for they\nsay that I can report at 10 tomorrow\nmorning, that my application is ac\ncepted and that the salary is oh,\nmother, dear, guess! guess! fluttered\nFlora breathlessly.\n"Surely not $50?"\n"No $75!"\nWhat a babbling and almost hys\nterical delight there was all through\nTold Flora How Badly She Had\nNeeded the Position\ntheir frugal meal! What hopes they\nbuilt on this sudden and unexpected\nfortune. Flora sat up until midnight\nmending gloves, doing up her hair,\nstarching and ironing her best waist\n"You pretty picture !" enthused the\nfond mother, as Flora kissed her\ngood-by. "I\'ve put a poor lunch in\nyour handbag, but it was all there is\nuntil "\n"My first week\'s great, grand sal\nary!" cried Flora, with shining eyes.', '"Then ph. then, won\'t we luxuri\nate!" Flora reached the office of Fairfax\n& Co. She told her business to the\ninformation clerk, who went into a\nprivate offiffice, and, returning, stat\ned that Mr. Fairfax wished to see her.\nFlora was impressed with the kindly\nface of the young man, who, it\nseemed, was the head of the busi\nness. He nodded intelligently as he\nread the letter and wrote a line on a\ncard.\n\'Take that to Mr. Doane, the office\nmanager," he said. "He will assign\nyou to your work at once. I hope\nyou will like your tasks here. Your\nreferences were excellent."\n"My references?" repeated Flora,\nin a puzzled way. "Why, sir, I sent\nnone but I have them with me."\n"That is strange," observed Mr.\nFairfax, and he reached over and\nlifted a large envelope from a little\ntray. "I thought I was right. Yes,\nhere they are."\nIn wonder, and then in sickening\ndespair, Flora glanced over the re\ncommendation of Miss Flora John\nson, but another Miss Johnson, at\nentirely different address. She felt\nfaint as the truth dawned upon her:\nWhoever had sent the letter had\nlooked at the directory and had ad\ndressed the letter to the wrong Flora\nJohnson.\nThere were tears in her eyes as\nshe faltered out an explanation.\nBlindly she tottered from the room,\nreached the outer office and then all\nbecame blank.\n"Poor little soul!" were the words\nthat greeted her as she opened her\neyes, and two typist girls were bend\ning over her as she lay on a settee\nin one of the inner rooms of the suite.\n"Mr. Fairfax is quite interested. It\nseems this girl had her hopes raised\nby receiving a letter intended for an\nother of her name. That poor lunch\nin her handbag! Isn\'t it a pity? Prob\nably her heart was set on this posi\ntion." "Mr. Fairfax wished to know when\nshe recovered," spoke the other girl,\nand Flora, sitting up a minute later,\nwas confronted by the young busi\nness man.\n"You seem to have come first," he\nsaid, an expression of real interest\nand sympathy on his -face, "your\nnamesake has not reported, so I think\nwe may take you on "\n- "Oh, no, sir!" spoke Flora imptu\nously. "It was this other Miss John\nson who qualified for the position.\nPerhaps she, too, is depending upon\nit to relieve to pay her way! I\ncould not think of causing her disap\npointment," and Flora arose and left\nthe room.\n"The brave, unselfish girl!" spoke\nMr. Fairfax in tones of profound ad\nmiration. "We have her address and\nI will look into this."\nHe could not get rid of a memory\nof that solent, pleading face all that\nday. He was eager, glad, as one of\nhis clerks, sent to investigate at the\naddress they had, returned and re\nporited the circumstances surround\ning the Johnsons.\n"What did you learn?" asked Mr.\nFairfax of his envoy, and his sympa\nthetic face was tense and concentrat\ned as he heard the sorrowful story of\nthe struggling girl.\nBut a new life opened for Flora\nwithin the next fw days. A letter\ncame from a large brokerage firm,\nstating that her address as an expert\nstenographer had been furnished\nthem and asking her to call.\nFlora found herself in the position\nof her life. Her companion workers\nwere charming, her employers con\nsiderate and liberal. Within a week\nall of the bloom had come back into\nFlora\'s face and renewed courage\nwas restored to her tried but intrepid\nsoul.\nOne noon, as she sat down at a\ntable in a restaurant where she ate\nher lunch, a pale-faced, frail-looking\nyoung woman abruptly took the seat\nopposite her.\nShe introduced herself as Mfss Flora\nJohnson.

In fervid, broken\ntones she told Flora how badly she\nhad needed the position. Now she\nthanked her for the sacrifice she had\nmade in her behalf. " -\n"And Mr. Fairfax said that it was\nthe noblest act he had even known.\nThat was why he got you your place\nhere"\nThe cat was out of the bag! Flora\nflushed with pleasure and gratitude\nat the kindly interest of the good\nhearted young business man. She\nwrote him a brief note that evening,\nthanking him for his kindness.\nAnd wonder of wonders! He call\ned upon her a week later, and then\nthe week after that.\nHis interest and sympathy were\nfast growing into love, and one eve\nning he confessed it. And the humble\nstenographer became the happy wife\nof a man of wealth.\nSPIKES ARE PRETTY ON COLLAR\nBy Betty Brown\nWhat\'s a spring suit without a col\nlar?

No\nclearer triumph of the best forces in\ncity government could be registered\nthan by the decisive re-election of\nWm. E. Rodriguez from the 15th\nward. In no political way can the\nresidents of that ward so well show\ntheir intelligence and serve their best\ninterests, regardless of party affilia\ntion. Probably no city in America con\ntains in its governing body two men\nwho better combine intelligence and\ntrustworthiness than do Aids. Kenne\ndy and Rodriguez of Chicago And\nwhile it is undoubtedly true that no\nsmall part of their intelligence and\ntrustworthiness is to be credited to\ntheir understanding of socialist eco\nnomics and their identification with\nthe great working class movement,\nsocialism cannot be the immediate\nissue of the pending election.\nThe question which residents of\nthe 15th ward must decide is wheth\ner they prefer to have in the city\ncouncil a mere rubber stamp of one\nor other of two political machines,\nwhose only result must be the fur\nther corruption of the people of this\ncity, or a man whose whole activity\nin the council will be dictated by the\nmost fundamental interests of all the\nworking people of this city.\nThe working men and working\nwomen of the 15th ward should also\nremember that it is not enough\nmerely to elect Rodriguez. That will\nnot fill the bill at all He is entitled\nto far more than that He was elect\ned by a small margin He should in\nthe coming election have as decisive\nja vote as that which was given to\nAid. Kennedy. With such a vote be\nhind him, his words and deeds in the\ncouncil will have far greater weight\nthan otherwise. He should receive\nthe vote of every voter in the 15th\nward who works for wages, and if\nthe workers of the ward know a good\nthing when they see it he will receive\nsuch a vote. Wm.

If there are other chil\ndren the mother generally takes\nwhat is left I believe this tells very\ngreatly at the time of confinement\nA mother wants good food before\nthe birth as well as after, but how\ncan it be done on the little money\nthat most working people get. The\nfather\'s food must be as good as\ncan be had, the children come next\nand the mother last. If she has two\nor three tiny children she never has\na minute\'s rest. The mother won\nders what she has to live for. If there\nis another baby coming she hopes it\nwill be dead when it is born.\nWe all know that children are ex\npensive. The poor literally cannot\nafford to bring children into the\nworld. They do it, but it is wrong\nwhen both mothers and children\nmjist suffer from malnutrition and\nthe lack of common comforts. Many\nof these children soon become pub\nlic charges in state institutions. How\nmuch more logical and economical\nfor the state to invest that money in\nmothers\' insurance.\nCapitalism considers the mother\nnothing more than a machine to\nbring more slaves into the world.\nM.

In\nthese days of ryanistic peace prop\nagandists and "we must prepare"\nshouters; of "turn the other cheek"\ndiplomats and disciples of belliger\nency, one is apt to become confused\nas to what is patriotic duty, if one\ndoesn\'t even become addled in try\ning to -define what is a patriot\nSince history has been writ, na\ntions imbued with a high spirit of\npatriotism have been nations which\nhave made great accomplishments;\nnot war accomplishments, necessar\nily, but great things in political, in\ndustrial, scientific and humanitarian\nendeavor.\nWhen patriotism dies a nation will\nperish unless permitted to live to\nserve the political or some other\npurpose of another nation.\nI do not define a patriot as being\none who wants to go to war without\nregard to the righteousness of cause\nany more than I agree with ihe Trib\nune that: "Our country! our\ncountry, right or wrong," even\nthough Decatur, who said it, was a\nman of intense love of country.\nBut I do believe in love of flag, in\nlove of national honor. I do not be\nlieve in war that has no just cause;\nI abhor the thought of war, but, if it\nbecomes necessary to the defense of\nour national honor, then let us fight\nuntil the blood of the last patriot\nsinks into the ground to atone for\nthe crime against honor.\nThe honor of a man is worth more\nto him than his life, if the creature\nis worthy to be called man, and so it\nshould be with the honor of a na\ntion.

So far as I\nknow this is the first indictment of\na capitalist on this charge in a long\ntime.\nIt is indeed a "gross outrage" for\na great financier to be indicted thus,\nfor his very wealth rests on such a\n"conspiracy."
