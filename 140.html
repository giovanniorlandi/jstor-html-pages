S.\nBOATS ARE SUNK\nPossible Loss of Twenty American Lives in Sinking by\nGerman Submarines of City of Memphis, Illinois\nand Vigilancia Subs Lend No Help\nin Life Saving.\nBY ROBERT J. BENDER\nWashington, March 19. United\nStates and Germany are on verge of\nopen hostilities.\nWith a virtual state of war exist\ning as a result of the ruthless sink\ning by German submarines of three\nAmerican freighters, it is now be\nlieved inevitable that the. first .meet\ning between an armed American\nmerchant vessel and a U-boat will\nmark the opening of actual hostili\nties. Semi-official view is united that\nGermany's destruction of three\nAmerican vessels with possible loss\nof twenty American lives leaves no\nquestion that the kaiser has forced\nthis government into a state of war.", 'It probably will have been found to\n!iue existed since the American\nsteamer Algonquin was sunk last\nWednesday.\nThe state of "armed neutrality" in\nwhich this government was. placed\nby the president continues, although\nit apparently has failed of its object\nto prevent sinking of such ships as\nthe Laconia, Algonquin; the City of\nMemphis, the Illinois and the Vigi\nlancia. That the president, as his next\nstep, would call congress in extra\nsession even before its scheduled\nmeeting date, April 16, was doomed\nlikely by some, though the prepond\nerant view was. that he would have\nthem assemble th 16th, then inform\nthem that a state of war had existed\nsince March IS and ask real war\nmeasures.\nIt was expected Wilson would con\nsult his premier and oflier authori\nties during the day. And having\nbroad war power already, according\nto legal experts, it is regarded prob\nable that he may take even stronger\nprotective means than merely arma\nment of American merchantmen.\nThe navy may be called upon to\ntake a vigorous hand, searching out\nand destroying submarines.\nAny call for an army undoubtedly\nwill await full authorization from\ncongress under a declaration of war.\nThe messages thus far at hand left\nbut little hope that no American lives\naad been sacrificed.\nDespite the fact thatthe United\nStates is nearer a call to arms to\nday, there is unruffled calm in Wash\nington, not only among officials but\namong the people of the capital.\nApparently Washington, through\never-recurring experience with inter-;\nnational shocks, is no longer suscept\nible to emotion. There is no war\nspirit in evidence.\nLondon, March 19. Shortly before\nnoon today United States consular\nreports to American embassy here\ndeclared the captain\'s boat of torpe\nAmerican steamer City of Mem\nphis was still unaccounted1 for. There\nwere tight men in this boat.\nIn all twenty-two\' men of the crews\nof two of the three American ships\nsunk by German submarines were\nmissing today.\nThe three ships were the American\nsteamers Vigilancia, City of Memphis\nand Illinois. All of the crew of the\nlast named were safely landed.\nThe Vigilancia was struck by a\ntorpedo without warning. Lookouts\ndid not even see the periscope of the\nsubmarine, nor did the U-boat em\nerge from the sea after the ship had\nbeen struck her death blow.\nThe City of Memphis was first\nstruck by shell fire from the subma\nrine and then sunk by a torpedo.\no o\nOTHERS MAY DIE FROM FIRE AT\nOLD PEOPLE\'S HOME .\nSeveral more deaths may be added\nto the list of four who perished in the\nfire that swept the Scottish Old Peo\nple\'s Home at Riverside yesterday.\nATailv nf thfi survivors ar ill frnm py.\nposure and on account of the ad-\'\nvanced age "of most fatalities may\nbe expected.\nThose who were killed in the\nflames were Mrs. Janet Greenock, 70 ;\nWm. McPherson, 92; Thos. Loutitt,\n76, and Wm. Robertson, 80. The\nmore seriously of the survivors are\nAndrew Minto, 84; John Harrison,\n88; Andrew Greenock, 76"; Mrs. Ida\nBell, 71; Mrs. Isabel Hope, 82, and\nJessie Campbell, 65.\nThe inmates were aroused by the\nbarking of a small dog, wso discover\ned the flames. The cause of the fire\nis unknown.\no o\nGO AFTER FOOD HOGS\nRobert W. Childs, special ass\'t U. S.\natt\'y, is\' rounding up his evidence\nagainst Chicago food hogs and he\nwill soon present it to the- federal\ngrand jury. Six special investigators\nhave been sent from Washington to\nwork out of the Chicago office in or\nder to get at the bottom of the food\nsituation.', 'J\nBROTHERHOODS WIN EIGHT-HOUR FIGHT\nROADS YIELD AGREEMENT SIGNED\nNew York, March 19. The rail\nroads have met the fullest demands\nor tne Adamson. o-uuui\nlaw and\nthereby definitely averted the threat\nened nation-wide strike, with the\ncountry on the verge of its most seri\nous crisis.\nPatriotism, swayed to its height by\nthe sinking of thre.e American ves\nselsfi brought from the \'railway man\nagers\' committee early today the an\nnouncement that they would accept\nthe brotherhood chiefs\' demands,\nrather than i give the impression at\nhome or abroad that the efficient op\neration of the country\'s railways will\nbe hampered or impaired in the face\nof its latest peril.\nThe railroads surrendered com\npletely, leaving their end of the ad\njustment entirely in the hands of\nPresident Wilson\'s mediation board.\nA joint committee is to thrash out\nthe minute details.\nThe following statement was is\nsued by the mediators at 6 a.m.:\n"We desire to express our appre\nciation of the large and patriotic ac\ntion of tne railway, managers\' com\nmittee, which has put beyond perad\nventure the possibility of a nation\nwide railroad strike.\n"The railroads have met the full\ndemands of the Adamson S-hour law.\nThis concession was secured as the\ncombination of two days and. nights\nof negotiations.\n"Our firstefforts were to secure a\npostponement of the strike which\nwas fixed for Saturday night This\nwas secured by presenting to the\nrailway managers a memorandum\nagreement drafted by the brother\nhoods, which with some particular\nity expressed the provision of the\nAdamson law.\n"We asked the railways to agree\nthat if the Adamson law was held to\nbe constitutional that this construc\ntion and application would be given\nto it The railways agreed to this at\na joint session between the brother\nhood chiefs and the managers.\n"And with much difficulty the\nchiefs stayed the strike, an act that\nwas vital to the success of our efforts\nand further mediation.\n"We next sought some adjustment\nthat "would be effective should the\nlaw be held to be unconstitutional. In\nthis regard many propositions were\nmade to both sides, but none was ac\ncaptable until the railroads expressed\ntheir willingness to place the whole\nmatter in the hands of this commit\ntee. "This action proceeded, as the let\nter from the railway managers\nstates, from a desire to demonstate\nto the country that . the railroads\nwould not allow their own concep\ntion of railroad policy to stand in the\nway of the fulelst use of the roads\nat a time of severe national strain.\n"The committee considered the\nmatter" was decided that in view of\nthe action of congress in passing the\nAdamson law. and the necessity for\nimmediate action that it was best to\nadopt at once the memorandum\nagreement of the previous day as\napplicable under all conditions.\n"Thus the provision of the 8-hour\nlaw, by agreement between the\nroads and the men, became the\'ba\nsis of the settlement, and whether\nthe supreem court holds for the va\nlidity of the law or against it thcra\nwill be no strike."\nThe railway managers\' agreement\nwith the brotherhoods today to put\ninto operation the eight-hour day on\na ten-hour basis, with pro rata pay\nfor overtime, means approximately\n$1,000,000 a week added to the pay\nrolls of the railroads. Thirteen mil\nlion dollars extra back pay, dating\nfrom Jan. 1, when the Adamson law\nwas to have become effective, will be\ndistributed among the 400,000 train\nmen.

Greatest oc\ncupancy of territory by any belliger\nent since German sweep toward the\nMarne thrilled .England today. Allied\nforces this time, are gainers. German\nline has given way.\nNearly 500 square miles of terri\ntory between Arras sector and river\nOisne have been added to allies\' hold\nings. German retreat was not headlong\nflight, but methodical, systematic\nturning back from untenable posi\ntions to others, doubtless long and\ncarefully prepared.\nRetreat has undoubtedly been ac\ncelerated by allies unexpected super\niority unexpected to the Germans.\nThey have surprised enemy with the\nvigor of pursuit\nLack of reports of any consider\nable losses of men and materials by\nGermans indicate withdrawal was\nfar from disorderly retreat.\nThere was much guessing as to\nnew line to which Germans are re\ntreating. One most favored by mili\ntary experts was from Donai to Cam\nbrai, St. Quentin, La Fere and Sois\nsons. At some places thrust forward car\nried allied troops ten miles into ter\nritory formerly occupied by Germans.\np o\nEdgerton, Wis. Olga. Osnard fell\ninto ice hole.

Despite\n) the talk of war and the threat of a\n, railroad strike, , large crowds are\n,) turning out to witness the efforts of\nI the White Sox and Cubs in their re\nspective endeavors against Texas\nj league and Pacific Coast league ag\ngregations.\nYesterday in Dallas the Sox, de\nfeated 3 to 1, played to 4.00D fans.\n) In Oakland the Cubs lost 9 to 7 be-\nfore a crowd of 4,000, and in the aft\nernoon they whipped San Francisco,\n7 to 2, for the edification of 5,000\nfans.\nSuch crowds for exhibition games\nare unusual. They not only point to\nenthusiasm during the coming sea\nson, but will help materially in pay\ning the board bills and transportation\ntariffs of our ball clubs.

In the sundown\ncontest Jim Vaughn and \'Phil Doug\nlass were tight parties in every in\nling. Prendergast and Hendrix have\nseen in difficulty ev.er since they\nstarted training. Neither "has been\nable to puzzle the enemy, and both\nhave suffered from wild streaks. This\nis somewhat of a surprise in the ca.se j\nof Prendergast, who was an able\npitcher last year, despite the small j\namount of attention he reeeivedJ\nroni management and fans.\nHendrix must show something in\nshort order, or he may get a bit of\nwork in the minor leagues. Last\nseason Claude was a sad disappoint\nment and had none of the requisites\nof a big league pitcher. He was wild,\nat all times, and nothing he threw i\ndisconcerted the aliens.\nEither Vaughn or Douglass will be fy\ngiven the honor of hurling the open- ?\ning game against Pittsburgh unless\nunforeseen obstacles crop out. They\nare the best conditioned men of the\nstaff and are working seriously.\nDouglass has at last cojne to a real\nization of the seriousness of baseball\nas a means of earning a living and\nif he can be kept in that frame of\nmind throughout the season he will\nbe a good pitcher through the cam\npaign.

Headless work on\nthe towpaths was an outstanding lia\nbility last season that caused the loss\nof many ball games and set the club\nback in its flight for the top.\nEldred and Risberg have -jobs on\nthe first team and both are .doing ex- (j,\n,cellent work. Risberg was one of\nthe baseTIinning offenders yesterday,\nbut this fault can be knocked out.\nHe is fielding all over the shop and\nhis hitting has been strong.\nFelsch has been the real swatter', 'of the exhibition games. Against\nTexas clubs in two games he\nknocked six hits, and three of them\nwere stinging liners for extra bases.\nHap was a star in 1916, but the ex\nperience he gained last season should\nmake him an even better performer\nin the coming season.\nFort Worth downed the seconds,\nthe first game a yannigan .Hose\nsquad has dropped in two years.

"And I\ndon\'t think I shall be in a hurry to\ndo so."\nOgden Kirk looked up in a mysti\nfied, questioning way. It was his first\nweek-end visit to the new country\nhome where he and his mother ex\npected to spend the summer. He\nhad hoped that their nearest neigh\nbor in the small house, whose lawn\nadjoined theirs, would prove com\npanionable to his mother, .as she had\nno acquaintances in the neighbor\nhood. "What\'s the matter?"\n"Well, I haven\'t (quite made out\nmyself. All I can say, it\'s queer."\n"What\'s queer?"\n"The goings-on over there. I have\nseen no one about but n young girl,\na grim-looking old woman and a\nscrub woman who came in to clean.\nYesterday the shrieks and moans and\nmaniacal \' laughter were enough to\ncurdle your blood. I was" almost on\nthe point of going over to see what\nwas the matter, when I, noticed the\nold woman ouside, calmly weeding\na flower bed, so I thought if she was\nso unconcerned over it, I would bet\nter stay home. My solicitude wuld\nprobably be resented."\n"Do you suppose," queried the\nyoung man, "she has fits of insan\nity?" .\n"It must be either that or hyster\nics. At any rate, it\'s uncomfortable\nand creepy. If I had known I was\nmoving next door to a private asy-\nlum I would have gone somewhere\nelse."\n"1 suppose the old woman is an\nattendant or some sort of keeper for\nthe young lady.\' Too bad, isn\'t it?"\n"I should think so."\nMrs. Kirk\'s tone was sharply em\nDhaiic. She was evidently thinking !\nof her own annoyance rather than\nthe plight of the girl which had been\nuppermost in her n\'s mind.\n. "Perhaps," he soothed, "it is only\ntemporary and won\'t go on long."\n"Perhaps," she assented, "But if\nit does "\n"Well, we will see," he said.\nThe next Saturday when young\nKirk arrived he jerked a significant\nThere Was No Souid of Human\nCompany.\nfinger toward their neighbor and\nasked: "What about it?"\n"She\'s had two or three attacks\nthis week; goes on just about the\nsame way."\n"I wonder if she is insane."\n"Well, a doctor has been there\ntwice this week."\n"How do you know it was a doc\ntor?"\n0)', '"His car looked like a physician\'s\nand he went In with a case in his\nhand."\n"Oh," said the young man with\nsome feeling. "Then there must be\nsomething the matter."\n"Did you suppose she was doing\nthis for amusement?" asked his\nmother with some asperity.\n"Well, no, of course not But\nwhen I came past there the young\nlady was training up a Vine and\n9 laughing and talking. to the other\nwoman, just asr well, as natural as\nany one." .\n"No doubt she has lucid hitervals.\nPerhaps they hope for her\' recovery\nin\'time."\n"I should think you\'d get "So curi\nous you\'d have to "call," ventured the\nyoung man. ,\n"Never! She might return it; and\nI shouldn\'t feel\' safe for a minute.\nDon\'t you, either, think of making\na call, if you don\'t want me to pack\nup and go to town."\nOgden had to at once disclaim any\nintention of so doing. He liked the\nplace and was looking forward to\nspending his vacation there.\nThe next week he came out to Stay\nfor awhile. In answer to his usual\nquestion as to the developments\nnext door, his mother replied\' that it\nhad been unusually quiet. Perhaps\nthe patient had\' been taken away.\n"Well, then she\'s back againfor I\nsaw the young lady as I passed," he\nsaid. . j\n"Perhaps, after all, she isn\'t the\ncrazy one. They may," she added in\na creepy, shuddery tone, "have some\npoor creature shut lip there."\n"I see it\'s up to me to fathom this\nmystery."\n"I don\'t see anything of the kind,"\nsnapped his mother. "You let it\nalone."\nThat afternoon he took a little\nstroll down to a small .stream near\nby to see if it promised anything in\nthe way of boating or fishing. In a\npretty, wooded spot, where the\nbranches hung over the. water, he\ndropped ostensibly to watch for fish,\nbut in reality to idle and dream. lie\nsaw a book lying in the grass a few\nfeet away. He looked around for the\nowner. There was no one in sight.\nHe listened, but there was jio sound\nof human company; so, after wait\ning a few minutes, he reached for the\nbook. It was Mrs. Browning\'s "Au\nrora Leigh," a book not much read\nthese days, but a poem he greatly\nliked. He began to turn over the\nleaves and to, read here and there\nbits that he loved. He saw that\nmany lines were marked, lines that\nespecially appealed to him. This led\nhim to look for the name of the own\ner. He read on the flyleaf, "Grace\nAnsley."\n"I wonder if. that\'s our neighbor,"\nhe thought "I\'ve never heard her\nname. Well, I\'m going to chance it."\nHe determined to return the book\nin person. The door was opened by\nthe grim, elderly person. Yes, Miss\nAnsley lived there, but she could not\ndisturb her just then. Kirk slightly\nobjected to leaving the book if it did\nnot belong to the lady, but she said\nit wourd be returned to him if it did\nnot belong to Miss Ansley. She took\nhis name and address and dismissed\nhim. That evening the elderly lady\ncalled with a note which Mrs. Kirk\ntook in. She handed it to her son.\nand waited with frowning impatience\nfor him to explain. In the note Miss\nAnsley presented her compliments\nand thanked Mr. Kirk for returning\nher book.\nThere was no way out of it for the\nyoung man but to tell the truth.\n"There, you see," said his mother,\n"the old woman probably had her\nshut up. for fear of a fit coming on.\nI hope now you\'re satisfied."\nOgden said nothing, but he was far\nfrom being satified. The next day he\nagain strolled down by the river.\nSuddenly a voice called "Help!" He\nhurried to the spot and saw out in\nthe stream a girl in a rowboat She\nwas very pretty and her face wore\na look of comic distress.', '"It\'s nothing serious," she laughed,\n"but I had to call you. I\'m stuck in\nthe mud. If you will please catch this\nline so the boat will be safe I can\nwade ashore."\n"I think I have a better way," he\nsaid. And throwing off his shoes he\nwent into the water and pulled the\nboat from the shallow place.\n"I believe you must be my neigh\nbor," she said. \'\'When I took the\nhouse the agent said no one would\nlikely occupy .the large house for\nsome time, as it was for sale."\n"Yes, we bought it," said Kirk.\n"You see, we came where we\nthought no one would be disturbed\nby the noise. I wonder, now if you\nhave heard it"\nIt was Kirk\'s turn to be embar\nrassed. "Oh, I see you have. I might as\nwell confess. \'Murder will out.\' I\'m\nstudying a big part. If I succeed in\nthis, my way is clear. I shall be\nwhere I have hoped so long. It has\na tremenduos hysterical scene in it,\nand old Madame Grandet is a terrible\ntaskmistress. She makes me go over\nand over it until it suits her. Oh,\ndear! I wonder what you thought!"\nWhen Kirk got up the courage to\ntell her, her laughter rang out so\nmerrily Kirk was induced to join in!"\nMrs. Kirk reversed her decision\nand called. And now the question is\nwhether Grace Ansley will give up\nher profession when she becomes\nMrs. Ogden Kirk, or whether she\nshall make her great debut He is\nquite willing she shall have her way.\n(Copyright, 1917, W.

I agree with\nhim, as it is this class of voters that\ndefeated him and won for me the\nnomination at the primaries, as I per\nsonally visited the decent voters at\ntheir homes and places of business\nand I intend to conduct the rest of\nmy campaign for election as alder\nman of the 18th ward along these\nsame lines.\nEvery dollar that I have spent and\nwill spend for my campaign " ex\npenses come.s out of my own pocket,\nand there is not a person in the ward\nor elsewhere that has contributed\nfinancially to my campaign expenses.\nI have no "jack pot" campaign\nfund to spend for "brass bands,"\n"athletic entertainments" or "auto\nparades," as I feel that the residents\nof the 18th ward have had this\n"stuff" so long and have been fooled\nby it so often that they are not going\nto be deceived into voting for candi\ndates who are making such a "big\nnoise" about their opponents and for\ngetting to say anything about them\nselves. I intend to conduct my campaign\nin an honorable, business-like man\nner by a personal canvass among\nthe decent, law-abiding, self-respecting\nvoters of the 18th ward, convinc\ning them that my past record is clean\nand above reproach, and any time\nthat any of my opponents desire to\nknow anything regarding myself or\npoliicies I am ready to answer them\npersonally, through the press or at\nany public place they may designate.\nIt is an absolute fact that none of\nmy opponents can accuse me of\n"buying votes" or "stealing votes" or\ndoing anything fraudulent to secure\nmy nomination, and I am at any time\nwilling to meet any of my opponents\non any public platform they may\ndesignate and answer any questions\nthey see fit to ask, if they will give\nme the same privilege.\nI am not affiliated with any\n"clique" or organization and have\nmade no pledges to any "bosses,"\ntherefore, if I am elected alderman\nof the 18th ward, I can give 100 per\ncent efficiency to my ward and the\ncity at large. John R. Lewis.\nCOLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP. In\nyour Public. Forum of March 12 Fred\nSaal asks me and other Socialists to\ntell The Day Book readers our rem\nedy for the high cost of living.\nWe Socialists have just one rem\nedy the collective ownership of\nland and tools. In .the meantime,\nworkers can benefit themselves very\nmuch by co-operative effort\nI was sent last fall to investigate\na co-operative colony at Llano, Cal.\nI found about 1,000 of the working\nclass there. They were solving the\nquestion of living in a most thorough\nmanner. They grew their own ce\nreals and fruits and built their own\nhouses. They are preparing to make\ntheir own shoes and clothing. En-', 'ertainments and medical service are\niree.\nThey have the advantages of good\nsoil, cheap land, healthy climate and\nwater. The plan seemed to be a great\nsuccess. I should like to see many\nsuch activities controlled and owned\nby the workers. But these activities\nhave their limits. Our only hope lies\nin the ownership of the land and\ntools by the users, of the same.\nWalter Higgin, 4106 Gladys Av.\nSTOP FOREIGN COMMERCE.\nAfter two and one-half years of the\nEuropean war, from which we had\nhoped that we were immune because\nof our isolated location and for other\ngood reasons, we have come, to the\nedge of the fearful precipice. Shall\nwe leap into the hellish chasm? Or\nwill some good angel open our eyes\nto the utter Heedlessness of this, and,\nwithal, the fearful consequences of\nit?\nAnd we had hoped \'that we could\nbe the kindly mediator between the\nwarring nations!\nIsn\'t it strange that the ethics of\nnations conflict so strongly with\n\' those of individuals?\nApart from the legal liability in\nthe case, a man is frowned upon by\n. his neighbors if he settles. his dis\nputes with his fists or a gun. ,\nWell, we have made some advance\nin civilization: fist fights and duell\ning are outlawed.\nArbitration and court decrees have\nproven more effective forth"e indi\nvidual than the old methods. This\nbeing the case, what logical objec\ntion could be presented against thejr\nadoption by nations as nations?\nWar cannot be supported by either\nlogic or justice.\nWhen a man commits a murder he\nalone is held responsible for the act,\nunless, of\'course, he has accomplices.\nWe do not say to an innocent\nneighbor of the murderer, "Now, you\ngo alter mat man and beat him to\n. a pulp or let him grind you to atoms;\nwhoever wins out is justified in the\nPTm \'J JJL4UUJ 93 $ 9 f P J?\neyes of the law." No! Just as likely\nas not the murderer, if a better pugi\nlist than the other, would be "jus\ntified in the eyes of the law." And\nwhat recompense could be given the\ninnocent victim?\' It would, simply be\nanother murder.\nYet that is just the way that na\ntions set out to settle their differ\nences. Both\' the nation that is ag\ngrieved and the aggressor set up\nthousands, perhaps millions of their\nmen, innocent citizens, to be shot if\nthey cannot succeed in killing . the\nother fellows. Whichever side wina\nout is "justified."\nNow, if we should go to war with\nGermany, I am afraid that it woukl\nbe the Teutons who would be "jus\ntified." We are in no shape to go to war\nwith any nation, least of all Ger\nmany, who is pastmaster inthe art\nof war. We have long known of tho\npossibilities of war, yet we have been\nindustriously shipping to one of the\nbelligerents the arm\'s and ammuni\ntion: that would be needed in this\nevent.\nFray, what would we fight with,\nour fists, ifur government should\nplunge us Into war?\nWe must not forget that it woukl\nnot \'be necessary for us to declare\nwar; an act of war would serve the\nsame purpose. One of our Illinois\nsenators in speaking of the power\nthat would be given the president in\nthe ship armament bill .is thus quoted\nin one of the Chicago dailies:\n"That right exercised is an ac(, of\nwar. I shall vote for the bill, but I\nwant no one to be deluded regarding\nthe responsibilities which it entails.\nAnd when I say that I shall vote for\nthe bMl I want to say that I will vote\nfor war if that must -come in order\nto preserve our rights and our hon\nor." A mayor has the right to warn citi\nzens off the streets in time of a\nriot \' What would we think of a\n"smart aleck" who would insist on\nhis "rights" and persist in mingling:', 'Hf\nwith the rioters? Would the city be\nresponsible for accident or even the\ndeath of such individual under such\nconditions? I think not.\nEngland and her allies started out\nto conquer the central allies by the\nstarvation plan. The latter in retal\niation started the same plan, and is\nenforcing it by submarine warfare.\nIf there is any more contemptible\nmethod of waging warfare than by\nthe starvation policy, I do not know\nit. . I would a thousand times rather\nbe blown up by a submarine. Peo\nple can keep out of the way of sub\nmarines. They are not obliged to\ntake passage on ships that are liable\nto encounter U-boats. When you at\ntempt to starve a nation, women,\nchildren and the aged are the vic\ntims. They are in their own homes,\nwhere they have a right to be.\nWhat did we do to prevent Eng\nland from carrying out her starva\ntion policy? But she is getting a\ntaste of her own medicine now and\nshe finds it unpalatable.\nShe does not want us to go to war\nwith Germany. She knows that in\nthat event the latter would blockade\nour coasts with her submarines and\nmines and our traffic with herself\nwould be absolutely paralyzed.\nI believe that it should be our po-,\nhey to hold aloof from all of the bel\nligerents; have no dealings with any\nof them until they are willing to talk\npeace.\nThis fight across the seas is not\nour fight and we should keep our\nhands off. Although we have been\ninjured by both sides, we can afford\nto forget it for the time being and\nresume the rolp of peacemaker.\nWe can keep ourselves busy lobk\ning after our own shortcomings and\npreparing for the judgment that is\nsure to come upon our own nation as\nwell as upon all other nations.\nI believe that if Germany had not\noffered to talk peace with her en\nemies that her people would have re\nbelled against her. If England con\ntinues to hold out against any peace\nmoves she will face revolution and\nsubsequent anarchy.\nI would not put it beyond the peo\nple .of my own nation, either, to rise\nup in rebellion should its government\nplunge them into war on the present\nflimsy pretexts.\nGod grant that wisdom may be\ngiven our president and our congress\nin these troublous times, and that\nthe Golden Rule will guide us in our\ndealings with all nations and with\nthe lesser units of our own nation.\nElfleda Benjamin.\nBILLY SUN DAY. Silly Monday\ncertainly has Billy Sunday spotted.\nMr. Monday go to it, you are doing\nfine. -\nI very much dislike seeing such\nexpressions as the followingin print,\nbut there are times when it is well\nto print such things in order to en\nlighten the public as to the character\nof such men as Sunday. Says Sun\nday: "If a minister believes and teaches\nevolution, he is a stinking skunk, a 1\nhypocrite and a liar. I don\'t believe\nyour old bastard theory of evolution,\neither; I believe its pure jackass non\nsense." Mr. Arthur M. Lewis, you are a\nhypocrite, and all your science and\nlearning is nothing compared to the\n"superior knowledge" of Mr. Sun\nday. (I hesitate to put a Mr. before\nthe name of Billy Sunday.)\nIt has been said that Rev. George\nR. Wallace of Toledo privately ad\nvised Billy to be tolerant toward the\ndoctrine of evolution. For his trou\nble Mr. Wallace got the following the\nnext day at a Sunday meeting.\nMr. Wallace\' was sitting \' on the\nplatform at this meeting and Sun-\nday turned upon him, shook his fist\nand yelled:\n"Stand up there, you evolutionist!\nStand up with the athiests and the\ninfidels and the adulterers and go to\nhell."\nIf you have a wife, sister, mother', 'or daughter, be sure and take her to\none of Sunday\'s meetings, that is, if\nyou have no respect for her. I\nwouldn\'t want my dog to hear Sun\nday speak; it might spoil him. And\nI have a great deal more respect for\nmy dog than I have for Billy. My\ndog has some brains and uses "them.\nIf Billy has any, there is very little\nevidence of them, in his so-called\nsermons\nIt is about time we were enlarging\nour Detention hospital as they are\nalways crowded after Billy arrives.\nIt\'s a good thing they have decided\nto build their tabernacle on the West\nSide. Th&y won\'t have so far to take\ntheir victims. I am sorry to feel this\nway about a fellow b,eing, but the\nworld has been overrun by lunatics\nof the Sunday type long enough.\nSunday is opposed to free speech.\nSunday is not very liberal in his\nviews and he hates the poor.\nIt is said that over 100 cases a day\nof saved souls were lugged into the\nemergency hospital during the Sun\nday meetings at Philadelphia.\nI understand that the hospitals\nare always connected with the Sun\nday tabernacles.

Touhy\'s statement in part\nwas as follows:\nCorruption, falsehood and a fake\ncandidate on the Republican ticket\nare the main reliances in the desper\nate fight being made to elect Barney\nGrogan alderman of the 18 th ward.\nIf successfully carried out, this de\nplorable program would give over\nthe ward to the complete domination\nof \'Groganism,\' supplemented by\nGalpinism.\' The prospect does not\nappeal to me any more than to any\nright-thinking man or woman of the\nL8th ward and is the principal reason\nor my independent candidacy.\n"The Grogan forces, supported by\nthe Republican ward organization, of\nwhich Homer K.
