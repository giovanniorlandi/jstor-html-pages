Early In October the letters begin\nto arrive asking for suggestions for\ntho ever-popular Hallowe\'en frolic,\nwhich occurs upon the last day of this\nglorious month. Each year it seems\nas if there could be nothing new, but\nI never fail to find some clever favor\nor some different way to, present the\nold stunts. Wj all love mystery, and\nas time goes on there are always\nyoung people for whom it may be a\nfirst time to celebrate this fascinating\nspecial day. Witches, bats, owls and\nblack pussy cats, with Jack o\'lanterns\nof all sizes, are tho accessories one\nmust have, and our Irish friends in\nclude the fairies, brownies, and all\nthe wee folks who dive and delve in\ntho underground world.\nFirst of all, there must be an invi\ntation that will tell a bit what the\nparty Is to be, and to add to the fun\nhave these mysterious messages de\nlivered by a little "brownie" carrying\na witches\' lantern ("Jack lantern").\nThis invitation may bo written upon\na narrow strip of paper and enclosed\nin an English walnut shell from which\nthe meat has been removed. Glue\nthe edgea together, leaving an end of\nred and yellow baby ribbon out to\nwhich to attach a wee envelope with\nthe address upon it and on the card in\nside write "Crack the nut and a mes\nsage you\'ll find, which answer at once\nand you\'ll be kind."\nTo save space this Invitation may be\nwritten on the typewriter:\nI am going to have a party.\nOn Hallowe\'en night at eight\nThe witches and ghosts are coming,\nSo bo sure and not come late.\nMarjorie King.\nIf the hostess wishes, she may tel\nephone all the girls and ask them to\ncome dressed as ghosts and ask them\nto come 15 minutes before the hour\nset. It will be best for the one who\nopens the door to be dressed as a\nwitch. In red cape, black skirt and tall\nblack hat with a red band. Sew black\npaper cats, owls, bats and lizards on\nthe cape and ornament the hat with\nthe Tery realistic spiders that are\nmade\' of wire and for sale at the fa\nvor counter. After the boys come, and\nthey may wear brownie and hobgoblin\ncostumes if they like, ask them into\nthe living room and let the ghosts file\nin one by one. No one must speak a\nwork except the hostess, who will ask\nthem to form for the Virginia reeL\nwhich they must do silently. If by\na laugh or familiar gesture a boy\nguesses who a girl is, and correctly,\nshe removes her ghost costume.\nDancing will probably be tho favorite\namusement. At 12 serve refresh\nments from a table with a witch\'s cal\ndron for a centerpiece, made from a\nblack kettle mounted on broom stick\nhandles. Run red and yellow ribbon\nto each place (Jock Horner pie style)\nand attach the ribbons to tiny witches\'\ncaldrons at aach place, made by fas\ntening three sticrks of red and yellow\ncandy into a tripod and filling the ket\ntle (doll size) with salted nuts. In\nthe center of the caldron have fa\nvors Indicative of the future, like\na week book for the "author." a\nbag of coins for the "banker," a suit\ncase for the one ulio Is to travel, a\nring for the one first to wed, etc.\nA suitable menu would be Welsh\nrabbit or lobster salad, cider. Individ\nual pumpkin pies, apples, nuts and\ngrapes.\nMADAME MERRI.\nTinted Curtain.\nWhite curtains are apt to soil very\nquickly. It is a good plan to tint them\nan ecru or yellow shade, although:\ntheir appearance may not be quite so\ndainty as when their lace is ot a\nsnowy hue. Rinsing the curtains in\nweak tea or coffee results in a pretty\nshade of ecru, but. as the stain washes\nout, the tinting must be repeated each\ntime the curtains are cleaned. Horse\nradish dye is more permanent, but it\nwill not resist soda. It is prepared by\nboiling two handsful of horseradish\nleaves In half a gallon ot water for SO\nminutes. Strain this decoration and\nthen steep the cuYtains in it until the\ndesired shado is obtained. Rinse\nthrough cold water before hanging\nthem up to dry.\nNew Waistcoat Waists.\n. Reports from Paris tell of satin\nwaistcoat waists, that is to say, satin\nwaists, the body ot which Is cut in the\nform of a man\'s waistcoat, with two\npoints in front below the waist and a\nbelt behind. The sleeves are of cln\ntrasting color.\nQuite as attractive as these satin\nwaists are the velvet waistcoats that\nare worn over white net waists. Thetie\nwaistcoats are made of striped velvet\nand are cut exactly on the fashion of a\nman\'s waistcoat One is made ot white\nvelvet with stripes ot pale green and\npale violet\nCleaning Fur. .\nBrown fur, such as sealskin, bear\nskin, etc., should be laid fiat on a ta\nble, and bran, slightly moistened with\nwarm water, rubbed Into the garment,\nusing a little at a time, then shaking\nout and brushing well with a soft\nbrush on which a few drops of sweet\noil have been sprinkled. White furs\nshould be cleaned with cornmeaL\nHeat it in a pan ou the stove until\nit is as hot as you can bear your\nhands in,\' then rub the fur hard, shake\nout and It will be clean.\nFRESH WHEY FOR YOUNG PIGS\nShould Be Fed In Combination With\nGrain, Corn and Barley Meal\nBeing Preferable.\n(By PROF. O. C. HUMPHREY, Wiscon\nsin College ot Agriculture.)\nFor pig feeding whey that is fresh\nfrom the factory or at least only\nslightly fermented is considered to be\nworth about one-half as much as skim\nmilk. It should be fed in combination\nwith grain, corn and barley meal be\ning preferable.\nFed In this combination, experi\nments Indicate that 1,000 pounds of\nLwhey have a feeding value equal to\niuu pounas or corn moai. urainary\nwhey has been found 25 to 30 per\ncent, more valuable than whey which\nhas been separated to recover the\nbutter fat. One to two pounds of\ncorn meal, however, added to 100\npounds of separated whey will com\npensate for the fat that has been\ntaken out. As It is doubtful if sour\nor stale whey is fit to feed any ani\nmal, pains should be taken as far as\npossible to feed whey in sweet condi\ntion only.\nIt requires more or less whole and\nskim milk and the utmost care to\nraise calves on whey. After calves\nhave been raised to a month or six\nweeks only, ten to fourteen pounds of\nfresh sweet whey fed daily with the\nbest of hay and a choice grain mix\nture will grow calves, but as a general\nrule not as successfully as skimmed\nmilk.\nFATTEN SHEEP FOR MARKET\nCull Animals Can Be Prepared Early\nIn Season by Turning Them Into\nRape Field as Pasture.\nAll old and such young ewes as the\nowner does not desire to keep should\nbe culled out to fatten a short time\nbefore the ram is turned in with the\nbreeding ewes. The cull sheep can be\nfattened earlier in the season by turn\nIng them into a rape field as pasture,\nbut if you put off too late special\nfood is required, in pure-bred flocks\nthe ewes are often kept until they die\nof old age. as their lambs are worth\nmore than they are, but in a graded\nflock it does not pay to keep ewes\nthat do not have sound mouths. An\nold ewe is likely to prove unsatisfac\ntory. In selecting rams the aim should be\nto select those that are strong in the\npoints in which the ewes are weak\nPrize-Winning Dorset.\nFor Instance, ewes that have an open\ncoat and are narrow breasted should\nbe bred to rams that are strong ou\nthose points. By this method a very\nuniform flock can be established in\na very few years. It is a good idea to\nturn the ram with the ewes In the\nevening after he has been fed aud\ntake him out in the rooming before\nbeing fed. A ram should be well fed.\nBran, oats, roots of vegetables, make\na good ration, with clover as rough\nage. HORSE IS A POOR REAS0NER\nWith the Exception of Sheep He Is\nthe Weakest Mentally of Al!\nOur Domestic Animals.\nThe horse is a very poor reasoner.\nMentally it is the weakest of all our\ndomestic animals except the sheep.\nTherefore, says a writer in Denver\nField and Farm, when once taught a\ntrick or allowed to do a certain act\nnot wanted it is with deep difficulty\nthat the horse can unlearn on account\nof mental weakness. x\nA horse kicks his muster to death\nwhen turned upside dowa with foot\nin stirrup, because in that position\nthe horse does not know what his\nmaster is. and suffers from imaginary\nfear. He kicks the shafts\nuntil his legs are broken because he\ndoes not know that the shafts are\nharmless and that he himself is doing\nthe damage.- He runs away In the\nsaddle or in the harness because he\nhas not sense enough to know better.\nWe heard a man. and one who\nclaimed to be a horseman, say not\nlong ago that a certain horse bad\nmore sense than the average boy.
