Leishmaniasis is a diverse group of clinical syndromes caused by protozoan parasites of the\ngenus Leishmania. It is estimated that 350 million people are at risk in 88 countries, with a global incidence of 1–1.5 million\ncases of cutaneous and 500,000 cases of visceral leishmaniasis. Improvements in diagnostic methods for early case detection\nand latest combitorial chemotherapeutic methods have given a new hope for combating this deadly disease. The cell biology\nof Leishmania and mammalian cells differs considerably and this distinctness extends to the biochemical level. This provides the\npromise that many of the parasite’s proteins should be sufficiently different from hosts and can be successfully exploited as drug\ntargets. This paper gives a brief overview of recent developments in the diagnosis and approaches in antileishmanial drug discovery\nand development.\n1. Introduction\nProtozoan parasitic diseases remain a major concerned\npublic health problem, especially in tropical regions. The\nmajor death toll is due to malaria, African and American\ntrypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis, whose high mortality\nrates in underdeveloped developing countries are associated\nto poor hygienic conditions and lack of efficient prophylactic\nmeasures [1].\nFor many years, the public health impacts of the\nparasitic diseases have been grossly underestimated, mainly\ndue to lack of awareness of its serious impact on health.\nProtozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania cause severe\ndiseases that threaten human beings, both for the high\ndeath rates involved and the economic loss resulting from\nmorbidity, primarily in the tropical and subtropical areas\n[2]. It ranks the second only to malaria, and the control of\nleishmaniasis remains a serious problem with ever increasing\ncases worldwide. It has become a major focus of concern and\na serious third world problem affecting the poorer sections\nof the society [3].\nLeishmaniasis is included in the list of neglected tropical\ndiseases (NTDs) [4] and has a strong link to poverty [5]. The\ndisease has been reported in 88 countries in five continents—\nAfrica, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America out\nof the seven continents (22 in the new world and 66 in the\nold world) [6], out of which 16 are developed countries,\n72 are developing, and 13 of them are among the least\ndeveloped [7]. Approximately, 350 million individuals are\nat risk of leishmaniasis and 20 million people are infected\nworldwide, and an estimated 2.0 million new cases occur\neach year [8] with an incidence of 1.5 million cases per\nannum of the disfiguring cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and\n0.5 million cases per annum of the potentially fatal visceral\nleishmaniasis (VL) [9, 10]. However, with increasing travel\nto and from endemic regions, there is an increase in the\nnumber of patients suffering from leishmaniasis [10–12].\nThe importance of this parasitic disease is further stressed\nout by the rise of Leishmania/HIV coinfection in many\nparts of the world including European countries such as\nSpain, Italy, France, and Portugal where up to 9% of\nthe AIDS patients suffer from fatal visceral leishmaniasis\n', '2 Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases\n[13]. However, due to underreporting and misdiagnosis, the\nnumber of actual cases is expected to be higher.\nNo effective vaccines are available against Leishmania\ninfections as yet and the treatment relies solely on\nchemotherapy, with pentavalent antimonials as first-line\ndrugs and amphotericin B and pentamidine as secondline\nagents [10, 11]. Miltefosine is the first recognized oral\ntreatment for leishmaniasis, but resistance to miltefosine\nmay emerge easily during treatment due to single point\nmutation [14]. There is a pressing need for the identification\nof novel drug targets, virulence factors, and development of\nvaccines to expand our understanding of the prevention and\ntreatment of leishmaniasis.\n1.1. Epidemiology: Impact and Geographical Distribution.\nLeishmaniases cause considerable morbidity and mortality\nand are a typical example of an anthropozoonosis. The\nmajority of infections are originally zoonotic, although\nsome cases of transmission of L. donovani from human\nto human are also known. The different epidemiological\ncycles are (i) a primitive or sylvatic cycle (human infection\nis accidental, transmission occurring in wild foci), for\nexample, L. braziliensis; (ii) a secondary or peridomestic\ncycle (the reservoir is a peridomestic or domestic animal,\nthe parasite being transmitted to humans by anthropophilic\nsand flies), for example, L. infantum; (iii) a tertiary, strictly\nanthroponotic cycle (in which the animal reservoir has\ndisappeared or has not yet been identified, and the sand fly\nvectors are totally anthroponotic), for example, L. donovani.\nNevertheless, many unknown factors remain. For example,\nthe main animal reservoir of L. braziliensis is still unknown\n[15]. L. tropica was considered to be a strict anthroponosis,\nbut several cases of canine infection have been described [16–\n18].\nLeishmaniasis is a complex disease caused by haemoflagellate\nobligate intracellular protozoa belonging to the genus\nLeishmania, family Trypanosomatidae of the order Kinetoplastida.\nVisceral leishmaniasis (VL), cutaneous leishmani-\nasis (CL), and rarer manifestations such as mucosal leishmaniasis\nand post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL)\nare the major forms of this disease. Parasites are transmitted\nby female sandflies via anthroponotic or zoonotic cycles\n[19]. Theparasites have a dimorphic lifecycle; flagellated\npromastigotes develop in the gut of female Phlebotomine\nsandflies to infectious forms that are transmitted to mammalian\nhosts [20, 21]. Inside the host, the parasites survive\nand multiply as amastigotes within parasitophorous vacuoles\n(PVs) of macrophages [22, 23].\nDepending on the transmission cycle, VL and CL\nare considered to be either anthroponotic (AVL/ACL) or\nzoonotic (ZVL/ZCL). Anthroponotic VL is caused by Leishmania\ndonovani and is mainly distributed in the Indian\nsubcontinent where it accounts for 70% of the burden of\nVL with estimated annual incidence of 500,000 and 50,000\ndeaths each year [24], a death toll that is surpassed among\nthe parasitic diseases only by malaria.\nBoth figures are approximations as VL is frequently not\nrecognized or not reported [25, 26]. The majority (>90%)\nof cases occur in just six countries—Bangladesh, India,\nNepal, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Brazil (Figure 1). Severe VL\nepidemics have been reported in the past in southern Sudan;\nin context of civil war and famine, VL killed an estimated\n100,000 people out of a population of 280,000 between 1984\nand 1998 [27]. As India, Nepal, and Bangladesh harbor\nan estimated 67% of the global VL disease burden [28],\nthe commitment of the government of these countries to\nlaunch regional VL elimination programme is welcome. The\ntarget of this programme is to eliminate VL as a public\nhealth problem by 2015, by using a local approach to reduce\nthe annual incidence of VL to less than one case per ten\nthousand individuals. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) results in\ndeath if not treated, the majority of leishmaniasis deaths\ngo unrecognized, and even with treatment access, VL may\nresult in case-fatality rates of 10–20% [29–31]. In East\nAfrica, it causes around 50,000 annual cases, in the form\nof epidemic outbreaks distributed in scattered displaced\npopulations with a high death rate. Post-kala-azar dermal\nleishmaniasis (PKDL), which is developed in 5–50% of AVL\npatients depending on geographical areas, requires lengthy\nand costly treatment with a low efficacy [32, 33]. The most\nrelevant factors behind the spread of AVL are the increasing\ntransmission in urban areas with large numbers of immigrants\nliving in poor conditions, the breakdown of social\nand health structures, malnutrition inducing weakening of\nthe immune system, and finally HIV-Leishmania coinfection.\nThe HIV-VL coinfection is characterized by frequent relapses\nand a high fatality rate, and cases are considered to constitute\nan important infectious reservoir [34]. Zoonotic VL is caused\nby L. infantum and is widely distributed in Central Asia,\nMiddle East, the Mediterranean, and Brazil. Up to 50,000\nannual cases may be caused by this form worldwide, with a\nscattered distribution.\nCL is commonly known as oriental sore. Its causative\nagents are Leishmania major, L. tropica, L. aethiopica, and\nL infantum in old world and L. mexicana, L. venezuelensis,\nL. amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. panamensis, L. guyanensis,\nL. peruviana, and L. chagasi in new world. It produces skin\nlesions mainly on the face, arms, and legs. It is frequently selfhealing\nin the old world but when the lesions are multiple\nand disabling with disfiguring scars, it creates a lifelong aesthetic\nstigma. In Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa,\nand some sub-Saharan countries, ZCL caused by L. major\naccounts for 500,000 cases every year. Outbreaks are typical\nin rural areas and depend on fluctuations in the rodent\npopulation. ACL caused by L. tropica is transmitted in urban\nzones and affects around 400,000 patients annually. Massive\noutbreaks have occurred in overcrowded suburbs with poor\nhousing and deteriorated environmental conditions [35].\nZCL caused by L. aethiopica is present in Ethiopia and is the\nmost neglected form of CL despite 50,000 annual cases and\na potential serious clinical progression, including diffuse CL\nand to a lesser degree mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. In South\nAmerica, around 300,000 new cases of ZCL occur annually.\nLeishmania braziliensis is responsible for nearly 90% of all\nCL cases. Species belonging to the subgenus Viannia (L.\nbraziliensis, L. panamensis, L. peruviana, and L. guyanensis)\nare capable of causing mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. No or\n', 'Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases 3\nVisceral\nCutaneous/mucocutanoeus\nFigure 1: Geographical distribution of leishmaniasis worldwide\n[37].\nincomplete treatment of CL is associated with the subsequent\ndevelopment of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. It is estimated\nthat there are 4000 new mucocutaneous leishmaniasis cases\nevery year [36]. The subgenus Leishmania groups comprise\ntwo main species, L. mexicana, causing a form of CL that\nheals spontaneously but can sometimes cause necrosis of the\nexternal ear (the “chiclero” ulcer), and L. amazonensis, which\ncan in some cases manifest as diffuse CL in patients with\nweak immune systems.\nAlthough leishmaniasis affect 98 countries in the world,\nit should be stressed that 90% of VL cases occur in India,\nBangladesh, Sudan, Brazil, Nepal, and Ethiopia, and 90% of\nCL cases occur in Afghanistan, Algeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Iran,\nIraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Brazil, and Peru [6]. Apart from\nVL and CL, diffused cutaneous leishmaniasis is also a type\nwhich is difficult to treat due to disseminated lesions that\nresemble leprosy and do not heal spontaneously. This form\nis especially related to a defective immune system and it is\noften characterized by relapses after treatment.\nMucocutanoeus leishmaniasis is also called “espundia” in\nSouth America. Causative agents of MCL in old world are\nLeishmania aethiopica (rare) L. major and in new world are L.\nmexicana, L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, and L.\npanamensis. The parasite invades the mucocutaneous region\nof the body and spreads to the oronasal/pharyngeal mucosa.\nThe soft tissues and cartilage of the oronasal/pharyngeal\ncavity undergo progressive erosion. In contrast to cutaneous\nleishmaniasis, these lesions do not heal spontaneously.\nSuffering and mutilation are severe, and death occurs as a\nresult of bronchopneumonia or malnutrition. There is always\na large danger of bacteria infecting the already open sores.\nReconstructive surgery of deformities is an important part of\ntherapy [36].\nThe classification of Leishmania was initially based on\necobiological criteria such as vectors, geographical distribution,\ntropism, antigenic properties, and clinical manifesta-\ntions [38–41]. However, biochemical and molecular analysis\nshowed that pathological and geographical criteria were\noften inadequate and thus, other criteria such as the patterns\nof polymorphism exhibited by kinetoplastid DNA (k-DNA)\nmarkers, proteins, or antigens came to be used to classify\nLeishmania [42–49].\nThe genus Leishmania comes under subkingdom Protozoa,\norder Kinetoplastida, and family Trypanosomatidae.\nInitially, species classification was based on various extrinsic\ncriteria such as clinical, geographical, and biological characteristics,\nfor example, L. guyanensis (isolated in Guyana),\nL. peruviana (isolated in Peru), L. infantum (isolated from a\nchild in Tunisia), and L. gerbilli (isolated from gerbils). Since\nthe 1970s, intrinsic criteria such as immunological, biochemical,\nand genetic data have been used to define species of\nLeishmania. Use of these molecular techniques led to the\npublication of a taxonomic scheme by the World Health\nOrganization [50]. New methods of detection, isolation, and\ngenetic identification resulted in a massive increase in the\nnumber of species are described. Today, 30 species are known\nand approximately 20 are pathogenic for humans. These\nspecies generally present different epidemiological and clinical\ncharacteristics related to different genetic and phenotypic\nprofiles. The validity of the classification scheme, considered\nby some workers as too arbitrary, has been questioned several\ntimes. Debate has centered on L. panamensis, L. peruviana, L.\nchagasi, L. infantum, L. archibaldi, L. garnhami, L. pifanoi, L.\nvenezuelensis, and L. forattinii [15, 51, 52]. Different studies\nhave already clarified the status of some of these species; for\nexample, L. chagasi is accepted as a synonym of L. infantum\n[51] and L. peruviana has been validated as an independent\nspecies [53].\nVery recently, Fraga and his team [54] used sequences\nof the highly conserved 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp70\ngene) to analyze isolates and strains of different geographic\norigin, showing that only eight monophyletic groups were\ndetectable against the 17 examined (Table 1).\n2. Diagnosis\nThe reason behind the diagnostic challenges for leishmaniasis\nis the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that they\npresent: ulcerative skin lesions developing at the site of the\nsand fly bite (localized cutaneous leishmaniasis); multiple\nnonulcerative nodules (diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis);\ndestructive mucosal inflammation (mucosal leishmaniasis\n(ML)); disseminated, potentially fatal, and visceral infection\n(visceral leishmaniasis (VL)) [55]. However, differential\ndiagnosis is important because diseases of other etiologies\nwith a clinical spectrum similar to that of the leishmaniases\n(e.g., leprosy, skin cancers, and tuberculosis for CL and\nmalaria and schistosomiasis for VL) are often present in areas\nof endemicity. These main manifestations may themselves\ndeviate, complicating definitive clinical diagnosis even further.\nCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) lesions, for example, may\nvary in severity (e.g., in lesion size), clinical appearance (e.g.,\nopen ulcer versus flat plaques versus wart-like lesions), and\nduration (e.g., in time of evolution or in time to spontaneous\ncure). Patient management, screening of asymptomatic\ninfections, surveillance including verification of elimination,\nand epidemiological studies are some of the areas where\ndiagnostic tests play a major role.\nIn all cases, it is desirable to have the diagnosis of\nleishmaniasis confirmed by the finding of the etiological\n', '4 Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases\nTable 1: Nomenclature of Leishmania species based on heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) gene sequences [54].\nName of the organism Geographical distribution\nL. donovani China, Indian subcontinent, Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen\nL. infantum/L.

When these approaches fail, immunological tests\nare used to provide indirect parameters for the diagnosis.\nIdeally, a test should make the distinction between\nacute disease and asymptomatic infection, as most of the\nantileishmanial drugs are toxic. Moreover, such tests should\nbe highly sensitive and specific, simple and affordable, but\nunfortunately some commonly used serological tests like\nDAT carry some significant drawbacks: the inability to differentiate\nbetween clinically active and asymptomatic infections\nand showing positive long after cure. Molecular diagnostic\ntools like PCR and real-time PCR are quite sensitive and\nspecific but are cumbersome to perform and have a high\ncost. DNA-based tests are available in strip formats but\nthese cannot be used in the field [56]. Compared to other\ndiagnostic techniques available, the molecular approaches\nremain expensive and require technological expertise, and\nefforts should be made to make PCR platforms more userfriendly\nand cost-effective, especially in remote areas where\nleishmaniasis is endemic.\n2.1. Parasitological Methods. Demonstration of the amastigote\nform of the parasite by light microscopic examination\nof tissue aspirates from spleen, bone marrow, or lymph\nnodes is regarded as the most suitable diagnostic instrument.\nIn preparations stained with Giemsa or Leishman stain,\nthe cytoplasm appears to be pale blue, with a relatively\nlarge nucleus that stains with red. In the same plane as\nthe nucleus, but at a right angle to it, is a deep red or\nviolet rod-like body called a kinetoplast. The sensitivity of\nthe direct examination is low, in case of cutaneous and\nmucocutaneous leishmaniasis, with a range of approximately\n15–70% in the old and the new world [57, 58]. In case of\nvisceral leishmaniasis, the specificity of this technique is high,\nalthough the sensitivity varies depending on the tissue used,\nbeing higher for spleen (93–99%) than for bone marrow (53–\n86%) or lymph node (53–65%) aspirates [59]. However, the\nprocedure for splenic aspiration is risky for fatal internal\nbleeding, so the results are totally dependent on technical\nexpertise and quality of prepared slides/reagents, both of\nwhich are often not available in field settings [60].\nThe microculture method (MCM) is a good method for\nthe diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with samples\nfrom both the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood\n(PB). The MCM is superior to the traditional culture\nmethod (TCM) as determined by its higher sensitivity in\nthe detection of promastigotes and the more rapid time for\nemergence of promastigotes. The sensitivity of MCM (100%\nin BMs and 77.8–100% in PB) is considerably higher than\nthat of the TCM (37.5–100% in BMs and 0–100% in PB)\naccording to decreasing parasite density (P < 0.05) [61].\n2.2. Serological Methods. The serological diagnosis is based\non the presence of specific humoral response for which identification\nof antibodies in the sera of patients is done. Serum-\nbased direct agglutination tests (DATs) using lyophilized\npromastigotes or urine-based latex agglutination tests (LATs)\nare used for determining antileishmanial antibodies or\nantigens in leishmaniasis patients. DAT has a high sensitivity\n(90–100%) and specificity (95–100%) [62, 63]. However, the\nmajor disadvantage of DAT is the need of multiple pipetting,\nrelatively long incubation time, high cost of antigen, and\nlimited production facility of quality controlled antigen. As\nwith any antibody-based test, DAT remains positive for a\nlong time after the disease is cured, thus cannot be used as\na test of cure or for diagnosis of relapses [64].\nDetecting antigen directly is an excellent method of\ndiagnosing an infection and is more specific than antibodybased\nimmunodiagnostic tests. Agglutination test to detect\nthe antigen has been evaluated extensively in clinical trials,\n', 'Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases 5\nusing urine collected from well-defined cases and controls\nfrom endemic and nonendemic regions. This test showed\n79.1–94.1% specificity and sensitivity of 60.4–71.6% in India\n[65].\nSeveral surface antigens, ribosomal proteins, nuclear\nproteins, histones, and kinesin-related proteins elicit specific\nhumoral immune responses in VL patients. Recombinant\nantigens have considerably improved the sensitivity and\nspecificity of immunological diagnosis over crude/total antigens.\nThey are more preferred than other antigens both in\nimmunoblotting as well as ELISA.\nImmunochromatographic strips using K39 antigen have\nbeen a quite promising method that has been tested widely.\nK39 (recombinant) antigen contains 39 amino acids encoded\nin the highly conserved kinesin region of L. chagasi. Using its\nrecombinant product, an immunochromatographic-based\nstrip test is used in which rK39 is fixed on a nitrocellulose\npaper, and colloidal gold-protein A is used for detection.\nIn the initial clinical evaluation, 100% sensitivity and 98%\nspecificity was observed. ICT suffers from the same disadvantage\nas DAT, being positive in a significant proportion of\nhealthy individuals in endemic regions and for long periods\nafter cure of VL.\nELISA has also been used in the serodiagnosis of all\ntypes of leishmaniasis but the sensitivity and specificity of\nELISA depends upon the antigen used. Most promising\nresults are shown by antigen RK39 with sensitivity and\nspecificity of 100% and 96%, respectively. The antibody titres\nto this antigen directly correlate with active disease and have\npotential in monitoring the chemotherapy and in predicting\nthe clinical relapse [66]. Due to the requirement of skilled\npersonnel, sophisticated equipment, and electricity, ELISA is\nnot used in the endemic regions for the diagnosis of VL [67].\n2.3. Molecular Methods. PCR-based assays form the mainstay\nof molecular diagnosis of leishmanial infection as they\nenhance sensitivity, reliability, and rapidity for the benefit\nof researchers and health professionals. The primers target\nseveral multicopy sequences for the diagnosis of human\nand canine VL which include ribosomal RNA genes [68];\nkinetoplast DNA (kDNA) [69]; miniexon-derived RNA (med\nRNA) genes and genomic repeats [70], the β-tubulin gene\nregion [71], glycoprotein 63 (gp63) gene locus [72], and\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions [73].\nThe PCR-ELISA has shown promising results for diagnosing\nvisceral leishmaniasis (VL) in blood samples. How-\never, the method has been validated mostly with HIVpositive\npatients who are known to have high levels of\nparasitaemia. As far as blood samples are concerned, PCRELISA\nis more sensitive (83.9%) than conventional PCR\n(73.2%) and demonstrated 100% and 87.2% specificity when\nhealthy controls who had never travelled to a VL-endemic\narea and controls from a VL-endemic area as references,\nrespectively, were used [74].\nRT-PCR simply refers to amplification of DNA (by PCR)\nthat is monitored while the amplification is occurring. The\nbenefit of this RT-PCR is that it allows the researcher to\nbetter determine the amount of starting DNA in the sample\nbefore the amplification by PCR. Also real-time PCR can\ndistinguish specific sequences from a complex mixture of\nDNA. However, its application requires the availability of\nprimers and probes that must be selected according to\nvery rigid conditions, which cannot always be easily applied\n[75]. Table 2 depicts the properties of few generally used\ndiagnostic tools for leishmaniasis and PKDL.\n2.4. Developments in Antileishmanial Drugs. Pentavalent\nantimonials were developed in 1945; the generic sodium\nstibogluconate (pentosan) and branded meglumine antimoniate,\nand so forth, are the first choice in the treatment\nof both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniases over more\nthan five decades where resistance is not reported [91]. To\novercome the challenge of clinical resistance to antimony,\npentamidine has been tried for the treatment of visceral\nleishmaniasis and was the first drug to be used for patients\nrefractory to pentavalent antimony (SbV) [92]. This drug is\nassociated with serious adverse events like insulin-dependent\ndiabetes mellitus, shock, and hypoglycaemia and death in\nsignificant proportion of patients. The declining efficacy,\nresistance, and serious toxicity associated with the drugs have\nmade it unsuitable as a viable alternative to SbV for kalaazar\npatients [93, 94]. Amphotericin B is one of the most\neffective antileishmanial drug, which induces high cure rates.\nUse of formulation of amphotericin B, a polyene antifungal\ndrug for treatment of leishmaniasis is biochemically rational\nbecause the target of the drug is ergosterol, which is the major\nmembrane sterol of Leishmania species. Due to high affinity\nof amphotericin B for sterols, aqueous pores are formed in\nthe membrane leading to increased membrane permeability\nand killing of Leishmania [95]. The need to develop less\ntoxic, more effective formulation of amphotericin B has led\nto new clinical formulation of amphotericin B in which\ndeoxycholate has been replaced by other lipids. Miltefosine,\nan alkyl phospholipids developed as an antitumor agent,\nhas an excellent antileishmanial activity.Paromomycin is\nan aminoglycoside antibiotic with unique antileishmanials\nactivity. Paromomycin is currently in phase IV clinical trials\nagainst leishmaniasis [96]. Sitamaquine, a primaquine analogue\n(8-aminoquinolene), is another orally administrable\ncompound (Table 3). To date, little is known about its\nefficacy and toxicity. However, there is a need to go for\ncombitorial chemotherapies which are under process and\nprovide better outputs.\n3. New Potential Drug Targets\nThe irony of the disease leishmaniasis is that it is the only\ntropical disease, which is being treated by nonleishmanial\ndrugs [97]. Much of the focus till recent times was being\nmade only on drug trials/combination therapy of available\nnonleishmanial drugs, evaluation of diagnostic and prognostic\ncapability of available tools, and very little emphasis was\nbeing paid on other aspects by leishmanial biologists and\nresearchers. Recently much emphasis has been given on novel\ncontrol strategies in terms of new drug targets and vaccine\ncandidates.\n', '6 Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases\nTable 2: Diagnostic methods for leishmaniasis and PKDL.\nDiagnostic\nmethods\nTest name Clinical specimen Sensitivity References\nParasitic\ndetection\nmethods\nLD bodies\nLymph node, bone\nmarrow, splenic, and slit\naspirates\nspleen (93–99%) than for bone\nmarrow (53–86%) or lymph node\n(53–65%) aspirates\n[59, 76]\nCulture (MCM)\nBlood, lymph node,\nbone marrow, splenic,\nand slit aspirates\n100% in bone marrow and 77.8–100%\nin peripheral blood\n[77]\nCulture (TCM)\nBlood, lymph node,\nbone marrow, splenic,\nand slit aspirates\n37.5–100% in bone marrow and\n0–100% in peripheral blood\n[77]\nSerological\nmethods\nDAT Serum, urine 94.8%\n[78–81]\nELISA/immunoblotting\nsoluble antigens\nSerum, urine 100% [82–84]\nRecombinant antigens (rK39,\nrK26, rHSP70)\nBlood, serum, and\nantigens\n100%\n[85–88]\nMolecular\nmethods\nPCR\nBlood, serum, urine,\nlymph node, bone\nmarrow,splenic, and slit\naspirates\n73.2% [89, 90]\nPCR-ELISA Blood, serum 83.9% [90]\nReal-time PCR\nLymph node, bone\nmarrow, splenic, and slit\naspirates\n90–100% [75]\nThe route to drug target identification has been through\ncomparative biochemistry of host and parasite enzymes,\nmetabolites or protein identified in parasite. Biochemical\nanalysis, genome sequencing of three Leishmania species\n(L. major, L. braziliensis, and L. infantum) has identified\npotentially useful target enzymes, transporters, metabolites,\nand hypothetical proteins that are distinct to parasite and\ntheir mammalian host. The genome mining will also aid in\nlarge scale proteomics studies generating expression profiles\nof Leishmania parasites and gene targets for treatment\ndevelopment. Search of new potential drug targets mainly\nfocuses on biochemical and metabolic pathways essential\nfor parasite survival. The target enzymes of these pathways\nshould have significant structural and functional differences\nfrom their mammalian counterparts for selective inhibition\nof target sites. Further, strategies to target more than one\nenzyme of a metabolic pathway simultaneously may prove\nmore usefulness and effectiveness. Biological studies for\nthe function of 50% of Leishmania genes are lacking. The\ncomparative genome study would provide a route to find\nthose that might be essential to each species [98].\n4. Thiol Metabolism\nThe enzymes of thiol metabolism/thiols, of parasitic protozoa,\nare different from those of mammals in many\nways. Trypanosoma and Leishmania are most remarkable\nin that they have trypanothione reductase (TR) instead\nof glutathione reductase (GR). This enzyme is responsible\nfor maintaining the parasites, reducing intracellular milieu\nby keeping trypanothione [N1, N8-bis-(glutathionyl) spermidine]\nin the dithiol state. The crucial role of TR for\nthiol homeostasis and its absence from mammalian cells\nsuggest that it might be well suited as a target molecule\nfor rational drug development. The trypanothione system,\nwhich replaces the nearly ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione\nreductase (GR) system, protects the parasites from oxidative\ndamage and toxic heavy metals and delivers the reducing\nequivalents for DNA synthesis. The parasite system is far\nless efficient than mammalian glutathione peroxidases in\ndetoxifying hydroperoxide, but has the advantage of much\nbroader substrate specificity, with lipid hydroperoxides also\nbeing reduced. The relatively low activity of the tryparedoxin\nperoxidase system is in accordance with the high sensitivity\nof the parasites to oxidative stress. Trypanosomes and\nLeishmania have superoxide dismutase (SOD), but lack\ncatalase and glutathione peroxidase. Thus, the trypanothione\nsystem seems to be the only mechanism to detoxify hydrogen\nperoxides.\nTrypanothione is kept reduced by the flavoenzyme TR.\nSeveral reverse genetic approaches have undoubtedly shown\nthat TR is essential in different Leishmania species as well\nas in bloodstream of T. brucei [99] and is thus an attractive\ntarget molecule for structure-based drug design. CastroPinto\net al. [100] have reported the cloning, sequencing,\nand expression of the TR encoding gene from L. (L.)\namazonensis. A 3D homology model for L. amazonensis TR\nwas constructed based on the previously reported Crithidia\nfasciculata structure. Within the past 15 years, numerous\ncompounds have been elucidated that inhibit TR, but not\nhuman GR, which is the closest related host enzyme.

This lack of success might\nbe attributable to several factors. The extremely wide active\nsite of the parasite enzyme represents an obstacle for a\nstructure-based drug design. In addition, the pharmacokinetic\nproperties of the potential inhibitors are crucial because\ninsufficient uptake, rapid extrusion, or metabolism plays\nsignificant roles in determining the in vivo efficacy of a drug.\nRecently, the biological activities of a series of mesoionic\n1,3,4-thiadiazolium-2-aminide derivatives were evaluated to\ndetermine their effect on trypanothione reductase (TryR)\nactivity in Leishmania sp. and Trypanosoma cruzi. MI-4NO(2)\nshowed enzyme inhibition effect on extracts from\ndifferent cultures of parasites, which was confirmed using the\nrecombinant enzyme from T. cruzi (TcTryR) and Leishmania\ninfantum (LiTryR) [101]\nThioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is a pyridine nucleotidedisulphide\noxidoreductase as GR, TR, and lipoamide dehy-\ndrogenase. TrxR maintains the levels of reduced thioredoxin,\na protein involved in the activity of ribonucleotide reductase,\ntranscription factors, and cell signaling and the detoxification\nof reactive oxygen species. Most studies to date on\nTrxR of parasitic protozoa have concerned the enzyme of P.\nfalciparum. Current evidence suggests that it is a promising\ndrug target, although validation is awaited. The absence of\nthis pathway in mammalian host and trypanosomatids sensitivity\ntowards oxidative stress, trypanothione reductase, and\nenzymes of trypanothione metabolism is an attractive drug\ntarget for antileishmanial drug designing [102]. Homology\nmodeling of Leishmania infantum, TR, and mammalian\nglutathione reductase shows a remarkable difference in their\nthree-dimensional and catalytic active sites. Hence, specific\ninhibitors designed against TR may be an ideal drug that\nwill stop parasite growth without altering host glutathione\nreductase (GR) activity.\n4.1. Sterol Biosynthetic Pathway. The enzymes of this pathway\nare attractive targets for the specific treatment of\nleishmaniasis, because the etiological agents for the disease,\nthat is, the leishmanial parasites have a strict requirement\nfor specific endogenous sterols (ergosterol and analogs) for\nsurvival and growth and cannot use the abundant supply\nof cholesterol present in their mammalian host. There are\n', '8 Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases\ndifferences in the enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways\nof ergosterol and cholesterol. A number of enzymes in\nthe ergosterol biosynthetic pathway have been investigated\nas potential drug targets for these organisms and have\nshown great promise. Thus, C14-demethylase, sterol 24methyltransferase,\n3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reduc-\ntase, squalene epoxide, squalene synthase, and farnesyl\npyrophosphate synthase have been studied both individually\nand in combination, with varying degrees of success [103,\n104]. Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors with potent in vitro\nactivity and special pharmacokinetic properties in mammals\ncan induce radical parasitological cure in animal models of\nseveral forms of leishmaniasis [105].\nTrypanosomatids contain predominantly ergostanebased\nsterols, which differ from cholesterol, the main sterol\nin mammalian cells, in the presence of a methyl group in\nthe 24 position. The methylation is initiated by S-adenosylL-methionine:\nDelta (24 (25))-sterol methenyltransferase, an\nenzyme present in protozoa, but absent in mammals. The\nimportance of this enzyme is underscored by its potential\nas a drug target in the treatment of the leishmaniasis [106].\nThe C-24 transmethylation reactions involving S-adenosylL-methionine\nas the methyl donor and a Δ24(25)-sterol or\nΔ24(24′)-sterol substrate can be inhibited by various azasterols\nwith a nitrogen substitution in the side chain and such\ncompounds have been tested against trypanosomatids [107].\n4.2. Polyamine Biosynthetic Pathway. The polyamine pathway\nof protozoan parasites has been successfully targeted in\nantiparasitic therapies. Polyamines are ubiquitous organic\ncations found in all eukaryotic cells and play critical role\nin key cellular processes such as growth, differentiation,\nand macromolecular biosynthesis. During the course of\ninhibition of any of the polyamine, the parasite cannot\nsynthesize trypanothione, a conjugate of spermidine and\nglutathione that is unique to Trypanosoma and Leishmania.\nTrypanothione is a reducing agent with many protective and\nregulatory functions and consequently its depletion proves\ndetrimental to the parasites. Recent studies on polyamine\nsupplementation show that L. donovani lacks an intact\nback conversion pathway, thus the pathways operating in\npromastigote stage of parasite differ crucially from that in\nthe host. Inhibitors of polyamine biosynthetic pathway have\nshown antileishmanial activity. Adomet DC inhibitor cures\nanimal leishmanises but has not been tested on humans and\nseeks further experimental studies [108]. Arginase provides a\nbuilding block for production of polyamines so it has been\ntouted as a potential antileishmanial drug target, because\nN(omega)-hydroxyarginine, an inhibitor of arginase that is\nproduced by the macrophages during the formation of nitric\noxide, can reduce polyamine levels in Leishmania amastigotes\nand lowers parasitic loads [109, 110]. Other enzymes of this\npathway which are under study as antileishmanial target\nare ornithine decarboxylases, S-adenosylmethionione, and\nSpermidine synthase.\n4.3. Glycosomal Machinery. In all kinetoplastida studied so\nfar the majority of the glycolytic enzymes are localized in\norganelles called glycosomes, whereas in other organisms\nthese are cytosolic. As a result of this compartmentation,\nmany regulatory mechanisms operating in other cell types\ncannot work in trypanosomes as reflected by the insensitivity\nof the glycosomal hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase\n(PFK) to compounds that act as activity regulators\nin other cell types [111, 112]. Blocking of parasite enzyme\nwithout producing damage to glycolysis in host remains\nchallenging. Several approaches have been considered—\n(1) exploitation of metabolic differences; (2) exploitation\nof differences in 3D structure; (3) exploitation of unique\nreactive residue in or near the active site of the parasite\nenzyme\nLeishmania like other trypanosomatids depends solely\non its host for carbon source to fulfill its energy requirements.\nThe amastigotes uptake blood glucose from mam-\nmalian blood stream and receive other essential components\nlike fatty acids, amino acids from phagolysosome of\nmacrophages. Due to the result of the metabolic activities\nof glycosomes, superoxide radicals are generated as side\nproducts in large amount. To protect glycosomal enzymes\nfrom superoxide radical toxicity, Fe-superoxide dismutases\n(FeSods) are evolved in Leishmania species. More importantly,\nFeSod is absent in mammalian counterpart, so it could\nbe used as effective drug target.\n4.4. Cyclin-Dependent Kinases. Cyclin-dependent kinases\n(cdks) play crucial role in cell division cycle, transcription,\napoptosis, and differentiation. In Leishmania mexicana,\ndisruption of cdk-related kinase 3 (CRK3) leads to change\nploidy level of the cell, though it was avoided when extra\ncopy of CRK3 was expressed from episome, ensuring that\nCRK3 is essential [113]. The chemical inhibitors of class\nindirubin of CRK3 hampers the parasite viability within\nmacrophage, proving the validity of CRK3 as potential drug\ntarget [114]. In Leishmania donovani, it was recently shown\nthat glycogen synthase kinase (LdGSK3) is also involved\nin cell cycle control and apoptosis as validations based on\nindirubin test [115], exploiting the LdGSK3 as potential drug\ntarget in combination with CRK3. Likewise, other cdk may\nalso be explored as possible targets.\n4.5. Folate Metabolism. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a\nkey enzyme in folate metabolism, linked to the production of\nthymidine. DHFR reduces dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate\nusing NADPH as cofactor. Therefore, inhibition of DHFR\nprevents biosynthesis of thymidine and as a consequence,\nDNA biosynthesis. Fortunately, this enzyme from Leishmania\nmajor and Trypanosoma cruzi has been crystallized\nand the structural data can be used to exploit structural\ndifference between parasite and human enzymes that may\nhelp to design selective DHFR inhibitors [116, 117]. An\napproach to discover novel parasite DHFR inhibitors using\ndatabase mining has also been made to search the Cambridge\nstructural database but DHFR as drug target requires more\nattention [118, 119]. In addition, it has been shown that\nthe enzyme dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate (DHFR-TS)\nthat catalyzes conversion of dihydrofolate from methyhylene\n', 'Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases 9\ntetrahydrofolate (M-THF) and thymidine, which is related to\nparasite survival and the parasite lacking this enzyme is not\nable to survive in animals [120].\n5. Mitochondria\nThe unique mitochondrial features of Leishmania make this\norganelle an ideal drug target while minimizing toxicity.\nLeishmania has a single large mitochondrion which is\ndistributed in branches under the subpelicullar microtubes\nand a specialized region rich in DNA called the kinetoplast.\nFonseca-Silva et al. demonstrated that the effect of the\nquercetin is associated with ROS production leading to\nmitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately causing parasite death\n[121]. The effects of several drugs that interfere directly with\nmitochondrial physiology in parasites such as Leishmania\nare under study. The unique mitochondrial features of\nLeishmania make this organelle an ideal drug target while\nminimizing toxicity.\n6. Conclusions\nAll the neglected tropical diseases together take the toll of\nmillions of lives every year. Leishmaniasis is a fatal disease\nwhich affects the people living below poverty line. The recent\nyears have witnessed extraordinary progress in diagnosing\nand treating Leishmania infection. Lack of efficiency, high\nprice, and growing resistance of the current antileishmanials\nimply the importance of search for new targets to be focused\nfor making drugs against Leishmania. The challenge is to\nconvert such studies in effective strategic programmes aimed\nto control and eradicate the disease.\nReferences\n[1] R. Pink, A. Hudson, M. A. Mouriès, and M.
