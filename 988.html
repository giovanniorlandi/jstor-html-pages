The war office re\nceived the following dispatch from\nGeneral Duller, dated Springfield,\nThursday, Jan. 11 : "I occupied the\neouth bank of the Tugela river at Pot\ngieter\'s drift and seized Pont. The\nriver is in flood. The enemy is strong\nly entrenched about four and a half\nmiles to the north."\nLondon, Jan. 12. Apart from the\ndefinite news that General Duller has\ncommenced a second attempt to croBS\nthe Tugela river, the only official news\nis thollst of casualties among the Brit\nish officers in tho fight at Ladysmith\nSaturday, Jan. 6, showing 13 killed and\n27 wounded. Among the latter was\nLieutenant Colonel William Henry\nDick-Cunygham, V. C, commander of\ntho Second battalion of the Gordon\nHighlanders since 1897, who has since\nsuccumbed to his wounds.\nThe war office announces that tho\nBritish casualties at Ladysmith Jan.\nC amo.ng the rank and file were 135\nkilled and 242 wounded.\nGeneral Buller\'s movement, obvi\nously. Is of a flanking character, but\nwhether it is intended to push the ad\nvance home or whether his operations\nare only a feint to cover an attack In\nforce on the Boer position at Hlang\nwana mountalri, remains to be seen.\nSpringfield, from whence General Bul\nler\'s dispatch was sent, is 16 miles\nwest of Frere. Tho last news from\nSpringfield was that it was held by\nho Johannesburg corps under General\nBen Vlljon, and that the Boers had\nbig guns in position at Potgieter\'s\ndrift, apparently six or eight miles\nnorth of Springfield and across the\nBig Tugela.

It Is reported that\nGeneral Duller submitted his plan of\ncampaign to Lord Roberts immediately\nafter the latter landed, and that Gen\neral Roberts sanctioned it.\nThero is a belief In soine quarters\nthat General Hector MaoDoriald will\nsucceed Lord Methuen in command of\nthe British force at Modder river.\nLady Methuen has issued an abso\nlute contradiction of the rumors that\nLord Methuen is ill, or that he was in\njured by the falling of his horse at the\nbattle of Magersfonteln.\nDetailed descriptions of the battle of\nModder river are being received by\nmail and printed by the London news\npapers.

The stoicism,\nstrategy, marksmanship and soldierly\nqualities of the Boers are most highly\ncommended by every correspondent.\nFrom a Ladysmith correspondent\ncomes this grim touch of besieged\nmisery: "Dishevelled women are peer\ning out of their ddns in the rocks and\nhollows in the sand. They crawl In\nla tho evening light, shaking the dirt\nfrom their pettlcpats and the sand\nfrom their back hair; they rub tho\nchildren\'s faces rdurid With the tails\nof their gowns. They tempt scraps of\nflames\' to-take the\' chill \'tiff the yellow\nwater for the children\'s tea.

Here the handcar\nwas left and the monoy was removed\nto a vehicle. Tho robbers then mado\ntheir way overland to the Wabash\nriver, crossing on the Illinois side.\nThe safe and vault were literally torn\nto pieces, and the doors and shutters,\nwere torn off the building.

A joint committee of members\nmight be named for that purpose. It\nwould be very popular, and also very\nexpensive, but it is .insisted that It\nwould bo a better way of preparing\ncongress for legislative action than\nthe plan of making up a commission\n\'outside of congress, and expecting\n\'me\'muers o\'f both\' houses to read their\nYeport after it had \'been\'made In order\nto become informed. .\nSubsidy Bill Up.\nWashington, Jan. 12.

The "Tobacco Fair" conceived by\nMaysville\'s Board of Trade and adver\ntised to come off on the 20th inst., is\na matter of no little importance to her\ncitizens and the farmers of Mason and\nadjoining counties.\nThe fair will not only eerve to bring\nMaysville into notice as being the me\ntropolis of a rich agricultural com\nmunity, but, also, bring the city into no\ntice as the mart through which tho large\nquantities of tobacco, wheat, corn, hay,\nrye, cattle, horses, sheep, hogs and other\nproducts of tho farm and soil find their\nway into the consumptive and manu\nfacturing markets of tho United (States\nand the world.\nTho fair will not only do this, hut ought\nto suggest to the intelligent and enter\nprising business man and capitalist the\npeculiar advantages held by Maysville for\ncovventing into plug and chewing to\nbacco the millions of pounds of white\nburley grown in Mason and adjoining\ncounties annually, but shipped to other\npoints for sale and manufacture.\nMason County is one of tho pioneer,\nas well as one of the leading counties in\nthe Stato of Kentucky in the production\nof fine grades of manufacturing tobacco.\nMany years ago, long before tobacco\nwas grown in many districts now produc\ning tho weed, the Mason County farmer\nwas raising and putting it upon the mar\nket as a means of revenue and support.\nIn those early days, after being cut, the\ntobacco was housed, usually, in rude\nchinked and daubed log buildings and\nby slow process cured by fire for strip\nping. The mtes of some of these old\nbuildings are still known to the resident\nof tho county, but reared upon them is\nthe present convenient, well framed and\nwell ventilated barn arranged for curing\nthe leaf by process of nature.\nThus, with a eoil especially adapted to\nita production and a husbandry long\nexperienced in tho art of cultivation and\ncuring, it is no wonder that Mason\nCounty tobacco holds a leading position\nin the markets of tho land.\nWhen sold upon tho "breaks" in\nLouisville and Cincinnati, or elsewhere, it\nis promptly bought by the manufacturer,\nwho is quick to recognize and concede its\nsuperiority for his purpose.\nWhy this product, so well and so\nabundantly grown here, has always been\nshipped away to Louisville, Cincinnati,\nNew York, St. Louis and other cities for\nmanufacture and not worked into plug at\nMaysville, has long been tho question\nasked by intelligent and observant men\nthe country over. With an output from\nthe county of Mason of about 5,000,000\npounds annually, and largo quantities\nproduced in adjoining territory in this\nState and neighboring counties just across\nthe river in Ohio, Maysville as tho center\nof this producing district has superior ad\nvantages for the manufacture of the en\ntire product. Tho city haa railroad fa\ncilities for shipment East, West and\nSouth, and the Ohio, river in competition.\nThese are sufficient to put it in eaBy and\nready touch with cities of other States\nand tho marts and markets of the na\ntion. .\nTho farmers of Mason and adjoining\ncounties should bo quick to see the ad\nvantage of a market for their tobacco\nright at home and bo eager to co-operate\nwith tho Board of Trade of MayBvillo in\nits movement to bring tho tobacco pro\nduct of our district into further notice.\nIf, perchance, the result should bo to in\nduco capitalists to como hero to manu\nfacture this tobacco, it would briny to the\npeople of the county and district millions of\ndollars, naturally theirs, which for many\nyears havefoiind their way into strangers\' cof\nfers. If tho 5,000,000 pounds of tobacco\nannually grown in Mason was manu\nfactured at Maysville, this alone, at a net)\nprofit of 2i cents per pound, would add\n$125,000 annually to the wealth of the\ncounty; not to mention tho benefit ac\ncruing to labqr employed and tho direct\nand incidental aid and nutrition result\ning to the business of Maysville and Bur\nrounding country.\nCapitalists, why not invest\'your money\nin a tobacco factory at Maysville? The\nexpense of shipping the tobacco from\nMason County and adjoining territory to\nbo manufactured in other and various\nparts of tho country costs thousands of\ndollars annually. If worked into plug\nand twist right hero where grown this\nexpense would he saved and would enter\nthe profits of the manufacturer.\nEvery farmer of Mason County and ad\njacent tetritory should have a sample of\nhis tobacco at Maysville on the 20th\ninst, and business men with capital\nwould do well to come here on that day,\nnot only to inspect the samples exhibited,\nbut to investigate Maysville\'s availability\nas a site for manufacturing.\nJno.

From the stand\npoint of political expediency, there is\nno question but that his nomination af\nfords the greatest hope of success. He is\nthe only Republican who has ever been\nelected from this district, on each occa\nsion overcoming a discouraging Demo\ncratic majority as shown by the elections\nimmediately preceding. The certified\nreturns from the election of last Novem\nber show that in this district tho vote\nfor Goobel exceeded that for Taylor by\n817, and the combined majority against\nTaylor was 830, in spite of the "dissension\nand bitter feeling in Democratic ranks.\nMr. Pugh is certainly tho logical candi\ndate of tho Republican party if for no\nother reason than his former success in\nwinning against such odds.\n1 1\nJohn E.

This lady, who\nwas always full of fun and frolic, left the\nhouse unknown to anyone and hied off\nto the home of her friend, the new\nmother, to see, the child whom she ever\nafterward called her boy.\nQuite an amusing incident arose on ac\ncount of the Duke of Orleans having\nbeen known to have been at "Washington\nduring his sojourn here. Some yearB\nafter he had gone back to France, an im\npecunious fellow at Washington, fur\nsome reason, was dubbed the "Duke of\nOrleans." He was indebted to parties in\nthe Queen City, and a .firm there wrote\nto Robert and John Taylor, making in\nquiry as to this gentleman\'s ability to\npay.

About fifteen years ago there was a\ncoat of napped rock three inches deep spread on\nthis piece of pike and tbe drains dug out with a\nboo and consequently it could not possibly be so\nbad as represented by Georgo; and to-day to sat\nisfy myself that George was extravagant In his\nremarks, I measured the depth of the mud and\nfound It lacked one inch, and a full Inch fct that,\nof being to tbe axles of the bus which ought to\nlearn George that while he is a good talker and n\ngood butcher, he Is no judge of pikes and mud,\nYours respectfully, W.
