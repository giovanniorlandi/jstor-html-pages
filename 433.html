It is alarming in that it is, fair to assume that it represent* a sen, timent that is prevailing in many quar, ter* particularly among those in hi>:h, places. The disposition among those, vhom these great senatorial leaders, represent is to deny those who locate, in Alaska the hope of ever enjoying the, right of American citizenship. They, would have Alaskans now ami fortve r, things apart from the great republic., There is nothing new in the objecti, ons expressed by Senator 1 Matt to the, Alaska delegate bill. A year ago he, offered an amendment to a similar bill, which provided "That nothing in this, act cootained shall in an\\ ? ise be taken, or construed to imply or indicate that, the territory in the district of Alaska, or any portion thereof, shall at any, time hereafter be admitted as a state.", However, it was hoped this position of, the Connecticut statesman would not, be insisted upon, but it seems that it, has not only become fixed with him. but, that others of power ard influence have, joined him in the reactionary move, ment., This determination to make outcasts, of Alaskans not only now but forever, is one that Judge Wickersham had in, mind when he suggested that a time, mi?ht come when the people of Alaska, would have to decide upon whether, they would remain a subject colony or, set up governmeQi keepiug for them, ?*ives, . .B, i-SS, 4.S0, Even the blood o" Uov. U\' ait v , ? no, has never b*eo an advocate of s -If-gov, ernnieet. is cot so sluggish but that it, boils over at the suggestion that Alas, kans may never bo permitted enjoy, ment of the heritage which Amt-ricun, citizenship implies. and which has now, become far more than a suggestion. In, h * last annual report Gov. Brady, con -, menting upon the Piatt amecdment to, the Cushman delegate bill heretofore, referred to, says, \'\'Since that day others have beta, thinking not only a little while but, long and hard We who have come to, Alaaka to build our homes in the pur, suit of happioeM are most vitally con, cerned .The proffered amendmint in text, aod spirit . proposes to make Alaska a, political inferno that aJl who enter are to, leave hope behicd. It seems to us that, the time has arrived for this question, to be discussed and thrashed out on the, floors of both bouses. Let a halt be, called while members go at it with (tails, Mod beat every grain from the straw and, ?haff.\'\', The time is at hand when this threat, aa to the future status of Alaska is a, positive menace to the welfare of this, district a d its inhabitants. It is in, cumbent upon the people of the district, to force the issue upon the American, people for settlement. To do that, effectively the lines should be drawn so, clearly that the people will no!, be con, fused. Let the people of Alaska insist, that they must be treated as were those, who inhabited the outskirts of clvilizt, tioo as it pushed.its way across the con, tinent. Let us demand a territorial, government such as has preceded state, hood elsewhere, and let us insist that, there be no quantisation clauses as to, the future io the organic act. Then, let the decisioa be made., OlTM HmIU. Vigor >ad Ton#, Herbloe is a boon ior sufferers (rem, ?Minit. By its use tbe blood is quickly, regenerated ?n i the color becomes u.r, m?l.
