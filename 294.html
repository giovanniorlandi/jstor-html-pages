It is an opinion article based on an \nextensive search of recent literature, an update of known facts \nenhanced by novel investigations.\nEndometriosis is an enigmatic disease of yet-unknown origin \nand pathogenesis. It is sustained by theories from long ago, when \nSampson1 described it as ectopic implants of menstrual shredding\npassed to the abdominal cavity through the Fallopian tubes. \nRecently, Brosens and Benagiano2 suggested that it starts with \nneonatal hormonal deprivation bleeding that many newborn \ngirls express in a retrograde fashion. Implants would remain \nuntil puberty.\nA celomic theory states that embryonic cells from the Müllerian \nducts persist in ectopic locations. At puberty, stimulated by \nestrogens, they grow to build up endometriotic lesions3.\nAccording to Nyholt et al.4, endometriosis is a “heritable, hormone-dependent\ngynecological disorder”. In their meta-analysis, \nthey identified five novel loci related to the risk of developing \nendometriosis. All five are involved in sex steroid pathways.\nThere is no reliable serum maker for this disease, and imaging \nstill leaves much of it undiagnosed. Ultrasound (US) has a good \nsensitivity and specificity for endometriomas (83% and 89%, \nrespectively)5. Unfortunately, in the case of deep infiltrating \nendometriosis (DIE), uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, \nvagina, and bladder, the overall pooled sensitivity and specificity \nof US transvaginal studies (TVSs) range between 53% and 93%6.\nHigh-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with \nbladder, vaginal, and rectal contrast has been a breakthrough in \nrecent times, as we proved at the recent XIII World Congress on \nEndometriosis7,8.\nIs there a psychological trait common to women with endometriosis?\nSeveral publications search for predictors of psycho-\nlogical distress9 but few focus on the personality of patients with \nendometriosis. Even fewer identify associations with their psychological\naspects. On patient health questionnaires, women with \nendometriosis show a high frequency of positive results for psychiatric\ndisorders significantly associated with pain severity10. \nNo personal traits allow us to identify subjects prone to develop \nendometriosis.\nLaparoscopy is the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of endometriosis.\nSurgical biopsies allow histological confirmation. \nLaparoscopy should be performed preferably by experienced surgeons.\nRemoval of all disease present must be accomplished in \nthe same procedure. The recent World Endometriosis Society \n(WES) Consensus for the Current Management of Endometriosis11\nstates that “Individualized care benefits from a multi- \ndisciplinary network of experts sufficiently skilled in providing\nadvice on, and treatment of endometriosis and its associated \nsymptoms, based on the best available knowledge, their extensive \nexperience and their transparent record of success rates”.\nAn ongoing discussion, the classification of endometriosis, will \nbe thoroughly reviewed in this article.\nMedical management is a centerpiece. According to the Consensus,\nold-time favorites such as danazol or gestrinone should be \nused only in the absence of side effects when other treatments \nhave proven ineffective11. Progestagens have proven efficacy12, \nwhereas gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRh) agonist therapy\nis not recommended for long-term use. Oral progestin-only \npills have demonstrated their ability to control the extent of \nendometriotic lesions on a long-term basis13.\nCombined oral contraceptives (OCs) provide initial pain relief, \nbut the long-term efficacy as a treatment for endometriosis lacks \nclinical evidence13. Moreover, there are even some data supporting \npotential adverse effects on the progression of the disease.\nUlipristal entails rare but severe risks such as endometrial hyperplasia14,\nendometrial carcinoma15, and hepatic damage. As \nrecently as August 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) had not approved the use of this drug for the treatment of \nmyomas (and endometriosis as well). In June 2018, the European\nMedical Agency (EMA) approved its use as a preoperative \ntreatment of fibroids. This short-term use before surgery could \nbe considered for endometriosis.\nNewly introduced oral GnRh antagonist elagolix NR is associated\nwith few minor side effects (hot flashes), excellent reduction \nof endometriosis-associated pain, and arrest of the progression \nof the disease when used for an extended period of 12 months16,17 \nat a 200-mg daily dose. Some moderate detrimental effects on \nbone density were reported18, suggesting that this drug should \nbe used with a hormonal backup.\nSurgery should be considered, during laparoscopy, in the treatment\nof the disease. All lesions present should preferably be \nresected. The issue of endometriomas, a never-ending dilemma, \nis discussed with sound evidence from recent literature.\nInfertility treatments for patients with endometriosis need special\nconsideration. Surgery and assisted reproduction tech-\nniques (ARTs) cross over according to the different stages of \nthe disease and the patient’s age. Minimal and mild disease \nfrequently benefit from expert surgery. Advanced moderate \nand severe stages usually require in vitro fertilization (IVF).\nDIE should be treated only by expert surgeons, preferably by \ninterdisciplinary teams. The question of whether it should be \noperated before infertility treatments remains controversial.\nQuality of surgery and certification of expertise are being \nrevised by the Consensus group of the WES. This issue will be \nthoroughly reviewed in the present publication.\nUnderstanding endometriosis (and patients with endometriosis)\nis the closing item. Current opinions on endometriosis \nquality of life (QOL) and psychosocial effects of the disease \nwill be discussed. Do not attempt to find in this publication a \nmeta-analysis or systematic review of the literature. On the contrary,\na documented update of endometriosis will be presented.\nPathogenesis\nAccording to a recent review19, there is growing evidence that \nhormonal and immune factors create a pro-inflammatory microPage\n3 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'environment that facilitates the persistence of endometriosis. \nThis relates to the disease’s two main symptoms: pain and \ninfertility. New drugs on the market (and in research) have \npharmacological effects on the endocrine and inflammatory \nfunctions implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. This \nwill lead to new investigative pathways in the pathogenesis of \nendometriosis.\nA. Implantation theory\nIn 1927, Sampson1 proposed a retrograde flow of the menstrual \nmix of blood and full endometrial tissue through the Fallopian \ntubes into the peritoneal cavity as the first step in the development\nof the disease. Brosens and Benagiano2 suggest that the \nfirst retrograde bleeding occurs at birth, when the newborn girl \nhas drastic hormonal deprivation. Tight internal uterine cervix \nos, thick cervical mucus, or malformations impede the normal \nexternal drainage of that mixture, which Brosens and Benagiano \nconsider a source of stem cells. This results in the passage of \nthat content into the abdominal cavity. These first implants will \nremain dormant because of the lack of estrogens in childhood. \nThey shall grow rapidly after puberty, when the ovaries start \nto produce sexual hormones.\nB. Celomic theory\nAccording to Burney and Giudice3, “celomic metaplasia involves \nthe transformation of normal peritoneal tissue to ectopic endometrial\ntissue”. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals might play an \nimportant role in such transformation. Addressing the theory of \nMüllerian rests, the authors state that residual cells from the embryonic\nMüllerian duct migration “maintain the capacity to develop \ninto endometriotic lesions under the influence of estrogens”3.\nEndocrine, immune, and stem/progenitor cells and epigenetic \nmodifications “must be considered in the context of genetic \nbackground as well as stimulus driven reprogramming of the \nfemale reproductive tract”3. Even extrauterine stem/progenitor \ncells derived from bone marrow are suggested to be possible \nsources of ectopic endometriotic tissue20.\nC. Inflammatory disease\nDmowski (cited by Burney and Giudice3) suggests that there is \nevidence that endometriosis is, in fact, a pelvic inflammatory \ncondition. A “peritonitis without germs”? The peritoneal fluid \nhas an increased concentration of activated macrophages and an \ninflammatory profile in the cytokine/chemokine axis. Zimmer, \nin the review by Burney and Giudice, is reported to link a haptoglobin-like\nprotein (that binds macrophages and reduces their \nphagocytic capacity) to the genesis of endometriosis. Increased \nproduction of interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage migration inhibitory\nfactor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 \nalterations is also described. Gargett et al.21 propose that human \nendometrium regenerates cyclically every month mediated by \nendometrial stem/progenitor cells such as CD140b+, CD146+, \nor SUSD2+ endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs). \nN-cadherin+ endometrial epithelial progenitor cells and side \npopulation cells would also contribute to the pathogenesis of \nthe disease. They are planted retrogradely at the time of birth \nor at puberty. The authors propose that the eMSCs may have \na role in the generation of progesterone-resistant phenotype \nendometrial stromal fibroblasts. Stem/progenitor cell differences \nbetweenhealthy women and those with endometriosis have been \nproven.\nD. Endometriomas\nOn the genesis of endometriomas, several theories have been \nupdated by Rizzello and Coccia22: \n1. Invagination: They are only pseudocysts produced \nby the accumulation of menstrual debris, which \ninclude active implants at the site of inversion.\n2. Celomic metaplasia: They originate from invaginated \novarian celomic epithelium, which has metaplasia of its \nglandular epithelium and stroma.\n3. Follicular: Some researchers proposed that endometriomas\ncould originate from ovarian follicles, but no clear \nexplanation for this theory was ever given.\nE. Aromatases\nA rare case of postmenopausal hepatic flexure colon DIE, in \na woman who had previously undergone total hysterectomy \nand bilateral salpingooforectomy, was recently presented by \nSnyder et al.23. They propose that autologous aromatase production\nat the site gave rise to a full-thickness infiltrating nodule \nfrom remnants or metaplastic endometrial tissues. They considered\nthis after checking that, without any surgery at all, the nodule \nvanished after prolonged anti-aromatase treatment.\nF. Hormonal receptors\nNisolle et al.24 found “heterogeneity of estrogen receptor α \nand progesterone receptor distribution in lesions of DIE in \nuntreated women, or during exposure to various hormonal treatments”.\nThis could be because DIE nodules are poor responders \nto different endocrine treatments.\nG. Deep infiltrating endometriosis\nPetraglia and Chapron25 consider DIE a different phenotype of \nthe same disease, shared with endometriomas and peritoneal \nlesions. It includes two locations: anterior compartment disease \n(bladder) and posterior compartment disease (vagina, uterosacral \nligaments, rectum, and ureters).\nSome invasive mechanisms characteristic of endometriosis, \nsuch as the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and activins, \nare enhanced in DIE. Also, a very high expression of the different\nmechanisms of neuroangiogenesis (nerve growth factors, \nvascular endothelial growth factor, and intercellular adhesion \nmolecule) is present.\nFor them, other immunological factors (peritoneal macrophages, \nnatural killer cells, and lymphocytes) are critically altered \nin DIE. The aggressive behavior of DIE may be explained by \nthe highly decreased apoptosis. Nuclear factor kappa-light- \nchain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), B-cell lymphoma \n2 (Blc-2), anti-Müllerian hormone, and the increased proliferation\nactivity related to oxidative stress (NF-κB, reactive oxygen \nspecies, extracellular regulated kinase, and advanced oxidation \nproteins) also contribute.\nPage 4 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'H. Epigenetic modulators\nIn a recent “master review”, Gordts, Koninckx, and Brosens \nelaborate two different pathogenic hypotheses26:\nHypothesis I: pathogenesis of early-onset endometriosis by \nneonatal uterine bleeding with the cyclic menstruation is the \ndriving mechanism for adenomyotic nodule formation.\nHypothesis II: deep endometriosis is a specific type of abnormal \nendometrium-like cell benign tumor.\nAs proof of this, the authors show that deep endometriosis \nis a specific disease, as reflected by the distribution of deep \nlesions in all stages of the Revised American Fertility Society \nclassification.\nIt might share with peritoneal or cystic endometriosis the same \ncellular origin, but genetic and epigenetic modulators induce \ndistinct presentations of the disease. In some cases, peritoneal \nendometriosis will prevail. With other epigenetic modulators, \nDIE will grow.\nThey have common structures when analyzed by the pathologist.\nThese authors propose that uterine adenomyosis and \nDIE have common origins, as in both cases glands are seen \ninfiltrating muscle tissue.\nDiagnosis\nA. Anamnesis\nListen to the patient. Carry on a detailed anamnesis in a very \nslow fashion. This simple action gives us the best approach to \nthe disease. She has so much to tell, to show with her face and \nexpression. In most cases, the disease can be understood just by \nlistening.\nThe omnipresent symptom is pain: cyclic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea,\nperiovulatory pain, chronic non-cyclic pelvic pain, \ndyspareunia (positional or permanent), dyschezia, and dysuria.\nThere are many other pain presentations that nobody even \nthinks of until confronted with an endometriosis patient who, \nincidentally, has exactly “that type of pain”. A young girl we \noperated last year referred to right shoulder pain at menstruation.\nAt laparoscopy, a large diaphragmatic series of blue and red \nlesions was excised. She was relieved after surgery.\nA similar case was reported recently by Singh et al.27. This \npublication elucidates the use of MRI for the clinical diagnosis \nof endometriosis, which will be shown extensively in this \nreview.\nInvoluntary infertility, even when not the cause for consultation,\nshould also be regarded as one of the frequent symptoms of \nendometriosis. Less frequently, cyclic nasal bleeding, umbilical\nbleeding, cyclic hemoptysis, cyclic constipation, and \nurinary urgency are reported by patients with endometriosis.\nB. Pelvic examination\nEven today, with the advancement of imaging diagnosis, pelvic\nexamination (in expert hands) continues to be praised as an \neffective clinical tool for the diagnosis of endometriosis. It \nshould be done with care, slowly, beginning with abdominal \npalpation. Only after no pain is registered, proceed to pelvic \nexamination. This should be done with extreme delicacy and \nrespect. Bimanual palpation of the uterine/bladder pouch, the \nDouglas pouch, and adnexa can reveal exquisitely painful sites \ntypical of endometriosis.\nFixed uterine retroversion is frequently due to uterosacral ligament\ncompromise or adhesions at the Douglas pouch. Painful \nuterine mobilization is another typical sign of endometriosis. \nCompression of the uterine fundus is frequently painful when \nadenomyosis is present. Dyspareunia frequently corresponds \nwith extremely painful palpation of the uterine-sacral ligaments.\nAlways look at your patient’s face during examination. Rictus\nof pain cannot be avoided. It will tell you exactly where the \npain is more intense, helping to clinically determine the extent of \nthe disease. Careful and expert pelvic examination provides a \nlot of information at a very low cost.\nC. Biomarkers\nAs of today, of the many biomarkers for endometriosis proposed \nin peripheral blood and endometrium, not one has been validated\nfor endometriosis18. This could be due to patient selection, \nsample collection, or analytical procedures. There is a current\nneed to develop a non-invasive test for patients with \nsymptomatic endometriosis.\nWe still lack a reliable marker for the disease. Ca 125, considered\na marker for endometriosis, is helpful only in postoperative \nfollow-up. It usually decreases after surgery and rises when the \ndisease recurs or progresses.\nClinical presentations vary. Signs, symptoms, and markers do \nnot correlate well with the extent of disease, as stated by Taylor \net al.19. In 58 consecutive cases of endometriosis, Hirsch et al.28 \nfound increased values of Ca 125. This group concluded that \nCa 125 of at least 30 units per milliliter is “highly predictive\nof endometriosis” in symptomatic patients19. The authors \npropose it as mandatory but consider it “unable to rule out \nendometriosis”19.\nMany publications describe gene abnormalities in patients with \nendometriosis. It would take a whole chapter to name them but \nnone has yet been validated for the diagnosis of endometriosis. \nThese alterations have been reported for the last 15 to 20 years. \nSome are showing ties with the disease. The large number \nof different approaches shows that the road is still unclear.\nIn 2016, after a systematic search of the literature, Neil \nJohnson, Cyndy Farquhar, and the Cochrane Library group found \nonly two biomarkers—PGP 9.5 (neural fiber marker) and CYP19 \n(hormonal marker)—that showed enough accuracy to replace \nsurgical diagnosis29. Even so, the authors state that “we could \nnot statistically evaluate most of the biomarkers assessed in this \nreview in a meaningful way. In view of the low quality of most \nof the included studies, the findings of this review should be \ninterpreted with caution. Although PGP 9.5 met the criteria for a \nPage 5 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'replacement test, it demonstrated considerable inter study heterogeneity\nin diagnostic estimates, the source of which could \nnot be determined”29.\nBlood, urinary, and endometrial markers—alone or combined \nwith imaging—were analyzed. The authors conclude that none \ncould be evaluated in a meaningful way. For them, there was \ninsufficient or poor-quality evidence. There is a clear final recommendation:\n“Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the \ndiagnosis of endometriosis and using any non-invasive tests \nshould only be undertaken in a research setting”29.\nD. Genetics\nFor many years, there has been a search for genetic testing that \ncould identify a population prone to develop endometriosis. \nA simple literature search identifies more than 3000 publications\nfrom 2018 linking genetics to endometriosis. Recently, \nan Australian group presented a summary of 17,045 cases \nincluded in a meta-analysis30. In them, 14 genomic regions were \nidentified, supported by results from multiple studies. The group \nfound that “no independent associations were identified from \ndirect genotyping of common and low-frequency protein-coding\nvariants”30. According to them, the most common genetic \nfactors related to endometriosis risk are located in regulatory \nDNA sequences. This, they say, alters the regulation of gene transcription.\nThey conclude that the target genes are present in three \nchromosome regions: “LINC00339 and CDC42 on chromosome \n1, CDKN2A-AS1 on chromosome 9, and VEZT on chromosome \n12”30.\nUsing single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology,\na 2017 publication31 describes genomic aberrations linked \nto the development of endometriosis. These investigators performed\nSNP array genotyping of pooled DNA samples from 100 \npatients with endometriosis and 50 controls. The authors detected \n49 copy number variation (CNV) loci that were present in patients \nwith endometriosis but that were absent in the control group. \nSix novel CNV loci in the subtelomeric regions representing \ngains and losses were identified. An intergenic locus on chromosome\n19q12.1 showed a strong association with endometriosis. \nAs with other biomarkers, we still lack a reliable genetic marker \nfor endometriosis, and none of the proposed genes or gene \nalterations can be used to make a precise diagnosis.\nE. Imaging\nUltrasound. In 1979, Walsh et al. presented their findings in 25 \npatients with surgically confirmed endometriosis or adenomyosis\nor both32. Sonolucent zones within the uterus representing \nblood lakes described adenomyosis. Other cases had cystic \nimages, five of which were of mixed characteristics. At that \ntime, “ultrasound alone could not differentiate endometriosis \nfrom diseases such as tubo-ovarian abscess, ruptured ectopic \npregnancy, other ovarian cysts or tumors”32. The authors stated that \nthe clinical history contributed to the non-surgical diagnosis of \nendometriosis.\nToday, some authors state that TVS “allows a better accurate \ndiagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis than MRI”33. For this \ngroup, it is less reliable in the case of uterine, Douglas pouch, \nand uterosacral ligament disease. Nevertheless, they propose \nit as a first-line imaging technique because of its low cost and \nfeasibility.\nThe International Deep Endometriosis Analysis group34, \nconfronting the wide variety of terms and descriptions used to \nidentify endometriosis at TVS, proposes some basic steps that \nshould be followed at the time of examination: \n1. Routine evaluation of uterus and adnexa (search \nfor adenomyosis and presence, or absence, of \nendometriomas)\n2. Evaluation of transvaginal sonographic soft markers such \nas specific tenderness and ovarian mobility\n3. Assessment of the Douglas pouch status (sliding sign)\n4. Assessment for DIE nodules at the anterior and posterior \ncompartments.\nAll steps should be performed, though not necessarily in this \norder, with a small liquid content in the bladder. A dynamic \nexamination assessing the real-time mobility of the pelvic organs \nis mandatory in these cases.\nThis article includes a series of drawings and photos that accurately\ndescribe the different images related to endometriosis in all \nof its presentations. For those who practice the steps mentioned \nabove, TVS is the first-line investigative tool in patients with \nsymptoms of endometriosis. The ability demonstrated by them \nto detect ovarian endometriomas and DIE is well documented. \nThe prediction of the pouch of Douglas obliteration is very accurate.\nIt helps to organize multidisciplinary surgical teams in the \nmost severe cases. They give most importance to the sliding \nsign since it allows clinicians to predict the severity of the deep \npelvic disease. One possible drawback is the issue of experience:\nonly those who have performed more than 2500 scans can \nachieve real proficiency in the sliding maneuver, after about \n40 examinations. Any trained staff can manage this non-invasive\ndiagnostic method for other locations of DIE except for \nrectovaginal septum DIE. A plight for a standardized nomenclature \nof US findings is mandatory for this group.\nAnother group presented clear and sound images of DIE in a prospective\nstudy35. They evaluated the wall of the rectum and the \nlower sigmoid colon with two consecutive TVSs. The first was \nperformed without previous bowel preparation, and the second \nafter a 3-day low-residue diet and two 250-mL enemas (12 and \n3 hours before TVS). They demonstrated that TVS after bowel \npreparation had a higher accuracy, allowing the detection of DIE \nbefore surgery.\nTransvaginal US is the first option for the imaging diagnosis of \novarian endometriomas. A 2002 meta-analysis performed by \nMoore and Kennedy et al.36, reviewing seven articles that fulfilled\nthe inclusion criteria, demonstrated that TVS is a useful test \nin the case of ovarian endometrioma.\nPage 6 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'In a retrospective observational study, an Italian group37 used \nTVS to evaluate 250 women of reproductive age (20 to 40 years) \npresenting endometriomas larger than 20 mm in diameter. The \nmean endometrioma diameter was 40 mm. Bilateral disease \nwas found in 25.5% of the patients, posterior rectal DIE in \n21.5%, and the thickening of at least one uterosacral ligament in \n35.4%. Seventy-three percent of the patients showed adhesion \nsigns, and 53% had concurrent uterine adenomyosis.\nOnly 15% of the studied population presented a single isolated\nendometrioma with a mobile ovary and no other signs of \nfurther disease. This publication highlights the utility of TVS \nfor the diagnosis of endometriomas, adjacent coexisting disease \nin other locations, and adherences. In 50 patients operated by \nlaparoscopy, TVS diagnosis was confirmed.\nIn 85% of the cases, endometriomas were associated with other \nlocations of endometriosis. Left-side cysts were more frequently \nassociated with same-side uterosacral ligament infiltration \nand DIE. Bilateral endometriomas usually obliterate the pouch of \nDouglas.\nComputerized axial tomography. “Computed tomography has \nno role in the routine evaluation of endometriosis except in very \nfew particular scenarios”38. An inguinal endometriotic nodule \nand a case of round ligament endometriosis that looked like a \nhernia were the only references found after a quick search of different\ndatabases, including Medline, linking endometriosis and \ncomputerized axial tomography (CAT) scans. Contrast studies \nmight be of use for the diagnosis of ureteral stops, stenosis, or \ndeviations in the case of lateral pelvic side-wall DIE.\nCAT virtual colonoscopy can also be of help. A recent study \ndescribes its use before surgery for DIE39. Associated with \nMRI, the preoperative diagnosis was confirmed in 71 patients \nwho presented a total of 105 endometriotic bowel lesions. This \ngroup found 71.2% rectal nodules and 60% sigmoid nodules \nthat infiltrated the muscularis propria in extensions varying from \n25% to 50% of the circumference. Stenosis was present in 73% \nto 96% of the cases.\n“The concordance between intraoperative and preoperative findings\nconcerning the presence of rectal nodules was high, at 0.88 \nwhen associating CTC [computed tomography of chemiluminescence]\nwith MRI, whereas each imaging technique taken \nindividually provided lower concordance coefficients”39. In this \nstudy, 80.3% of patients underwent the procedure that had been \npreoperatively planned. These authors propose that the association\nof both techniques improves the accuracy of preoperative \nassessment of colorectal DIE.\nMagnetic resonance imaging. In 1999, a pioneer article \ndescribed the use of MRI for the preoperative diagnosis of \nendometriosis40. The authors described, in 20 patients, MRI findings\nof DIE at the uterosacral ligaments, the pouch of Douglas, \nthe rectum, and the bladder that were histologically proven at \nsurgery. Diagnosis was accurate except when contrast was not \nused (two of three patients with rectal endometriosis).\nA decade before, Arrivé et al.41 published the first report of \nMRI use for the clinical diagnosis of endometriosis. Using only \n0.35 Tesla, they prospectively studied 30 consecutive women \nwith symptomatic disease. In 25 cases, endometriosis was confirmed\nby surgery. A sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 60%, \nwith an accuracy of 63%, were shown. Most endometriomas \nwere correctly identified. Only 14 of 29 cases of adhesions and \n6 of 45 cases of peritoneal implants were diagnosed by MRI. \n“MRI findings did not correlate with the surgically determined\nseverity of the disease”41. In 1989, the authors concluded \nthat MRI could not be used as the first study to detect \nendometriosis. For them, laparoscopy was the procedure of choice.\nLast year, at the XIII World Congress on Endometriosis, our group \npresented three posters42–44 that established a perfect correlation\nof high-resolution contrast MRIs with laparoscopic findings, \nusing 2- and 3-Tesla devices. MRIs and intraoperative images \nfrom one of the posters are displayed in Figure 1.\nUsing a high-resolution technique (1-mm slices), intravenous \ncontrast (for bladder visualization), and vaginal and rectal gel \ncontrast (for better visualization of the rectovaginal septum), we \nwere able to stage the disease before laparoscopy. We demonstrated\nthe special ability of this method to visualize superficial \nimplants, adhesions, uterosacral ligament infiltration, rectovaginal\nseptum infiltration (including the depth of rectal invasion), \nbladder wall infiltration, and ovarian disease. Images of ureteral\ncompromise were also obtained (unpublished). Whenever \npossible, MRI would be mandatory before laparoscopy.\nA recent publication45 shows an interesting algorithm that allows \nclinicians to predict the probability of bowel resection at the \ntime of laparoscopy for DIE using MRI. In 52 patients studied \npreoperatively, a positive predictive value of 87% and a negative\npredictive value of 83% were demonstrated. This group cal-\nculated the impact angle and lesion size by using a mathematical \nalgorithm.\nIn 2009, the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic\nreviews and Meta-Analyses) group proposed an evi-\ndence-based minimum set of items required for reporting in \nsystematic reviews (http://www.prisma-statement.org). A recent \npublication46 evaluated the use of TVS and MRI for the diagnosis \nof adenomyosis, reviewing evidence in accordance with PRISMA \nrequirements.\nFor TVS, they found a high heterogeneity between studies. \nThe pooled positive likelihood ratios for adenomyosis were \n0.72–0.82, 0.85–0.81, and 4.67–3.7, a clearly diffuse variety of \ninformation. In contrast, the pooled sensitivity for MRI was \n0.77, the specificity 0.89, the positive likelihood ratio 6.5, and \nthe negative likelihood ratio 0.2 for all subtypes of adenomyosis\nand publications. This suggests that MRI is more useful than \nTVS for the diagnosis of adenomyosis.\nLaparoscopy\nLaparoscopy is the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of endometriosis.\nIt certifies the presence of the disease and its extension. \nPage 7 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'By means of tissue biopsies and its pathological analysis, the \naggressiveness of the lesions can be determined.

Fifty-five representatives of 29 \nnational and international, medical and non-medical organizations \nfrom a range of disciplines contributed.\nIt produced a statement that says: “until better classification \nsystems are developed, we propose a classification toolbox”47. \nThis includes the revised American Society for Reproductive \nMedicine (rASRM) classification, the Enzian classification, and \nthe endometriosis fertility index (EFI).\nThe most used staging system is the rASRM classification \n(1997), which ignores DIE. Kecktein in 2003 and Haas in 2013 \nproposed the Enzian classification for DIE as a complement \nto rASRM. In 2010, Adamson and Pasta introduced the EFI, \nalthough it is strictly related to endometriosis-associated infertility.\nThe Consensus reported that “however, the classification systems\nin current use continue to attract criticism from women with \nendometriosis and those providing care for them because of \nthe poor correlation with disease symptoms as well as a lack of \npredictive prognosis and, to date, unclear pathways of treating \npelvic pain and infertility based” on them47.\nRevised American Society for Reproductive Medicine \nclassification\nIn Figure 2, the rASRM classification is deployed. It was originally\nthought of by Acosta et al.48 in 1973 while working with \nFigure 1.

Some \npatients who would be classified as “severe” by ASRM revised \ncharts experience little pain but do not get pregnant. Others, \nwith only superficial red and blue lesions and minor adhesions, \nexperience severe pain and a poor QOL. They probably would \nbe entered as “mild” or even “minimal” using this proposal. \nThe same occurs with DIE and pain. The question is: Should \nwe include pain as a new item when establishing a definitive\nclassification? Adamson, in a recent update on classifica-\ntions49, reports that the American Association of Gynecological \nLaparoscopists is developing a categorization system that will \nbe more focused on pain.\nKoninckx and Wattiez et al.\nIn 2011, Koninckx and Wattiez et al.54 presented a proposal that \nincluded adenomyosis, peritoneal pocket lesions, and subtle \nendometriosis plus the three traditionally recorded lesions \n(peritoneal, cystic, and deep). It considers the size of each \nlesion and includes pain as an issue. They state that the significance\nof the subtler lesions is not clear since they have not “been \ndemonstrated to be associated with pain or infertility”54.\nFor them, subtle lesions and DIE (any lesion deeper than 5 \nmm under the peritoneal surface) should be classified apart. \nIn regard to pain, they cite authors who link pelvic pain with \nlymph node involvement in the case of DIE. That is, lymph \ncompromise is a marker of more intense pain. In Figure 5, we \ndepict their classification proposal, which is not yet validated.\nOther proposals\nIn 2011, Charles Miller and Mauricio Abrao presented an article\nentitled “Six Good Reasons for a NEW Endometriosis \nClassification”55. They propose that a classification should do \nthe following: \n1. Clearly describe the sites and extent of disease— \nperitoneal, ovarian, and deep endometriosis, including \nbowel, ureter, and bladder.\nFigure 5. A new proposal by Koninckx and Wattiez et al.54.\nPage 13 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', '2.

According to them, they all act by inhibiting \novulation, reducing serum estradiol levels, and diminishing uterine\nblood flow. They state that several drugs can be used “with a \nsimilar magnitude of effect, in terms of pain relief”56. They \ncan be categorized by price, as low-cost drugs (OCs and most \nprogestogens) or high-cost drugs (dienogest, GnRH agonists, \nand the newly introduced elagolix). They recommend starting \ntreatment with low-cost drugs and step up to high-cost ones only \nin case of “inefficacy or intolerance”56. For them, OCs are useful\nfor superficial peritoneal disease or endometriomas smaller \nthan 5 cm in diameter, and progestogens have a better effect \nin severe dyspareunia associated with deeper infiltrating lesions.\nBack in the late 1970s, danazol NR was “the” drug. It relieved \npain after diagnostic laparoscopy or conventional ovarian cystectomy—not\nmuch more was accomplished in the operating room \n(OR) at that time. Patients gained weight, grew a beard, and had \nelevated hepatic enzymes, but pain was gone, and progression \nprobably arrested.\nIn 1988, Taymor et al.57 questioned its clinical efficacy in infertile\nwomen. This prospective randomized study showed dana-\nzol to be ineffective in improving pregnancy rates over doing \nnothing at all in patients with minimal endometriosis. Years \nlater, the World Consensus for the Current Management of \nEndometriosis11 recommended it only before IVF in severe \nendometriosis.\nDanazol is a drug of the past. OCs, progestogens, GnRH agonists,\nand lately GnRH antagonists (elagolix) and (to some extent) \nhormonal receptor modulators (such as ulipristal) are current \nspecific medications. The role of antiestrogens is not clear, nor \nis that of natural origin substances (such as resveratrol), anti- \naromatases, anti-angiogenic molecules, and immunomodulators.\nPain\nPain is the most common reason for consultation; moreover, \ninfertile patients often have chronic pelvic pain as well. Arrest \nof pain is always a priority.\nWe presented a poster at the XI World Congress on Endometriosis\n(Montpellier, France, 2011) and posters at the XII World \nCongress on Endometriosis (São Paulo, Brazil, 2014) showing \nthe immediate pain relief and positive changes in over 100 studied\npatients. Their QOL improved immediately after a correct \nlaparoscopic surgery in superficial endometriosis of different \nseverities.\nTwo surgeons—Jose M. Curto and myself—participated. \nThe quality of surgery was standard and reproducible. Surprisingly,\n100% of the patients indicated an immediately better QOL \nafter surgery. In all cases, postoperative treatment was allocated \nto control pain or infertility or both.\nThe traditional management of pain includes different approaches \nand different pathways. The group headed by Catherine Allaire \nstates that, other than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs), “further work is required for nonhormonal therapies\nsuch as antiangiogenic and immune-modulating drugs”58. \nThey list as “traditional hormonal therapies” estrogen-progestin \ncontraceptives, progestins, and GnRH agonists. Other hormonal\ntreatment options are androgens and aromatase inhibi-\ntors. “Research also suggests a possible role for GnRH antagonists\nand selective progesterone receptor modulators, always \ndiscussing with each patient side effects and/or desire for \npregnancy to ensure personalized treatment and optimal \noutcomes”58.\nCuriosities still occur in this field, such as the method used by \nGeorge et al.59 to treat persistent endometriosis chronic pain \nin a 32-year-old patient. That group administered 10 daily, \n20-min sessions of 2-mA anodal transcranial direct current stimulation\nover the left primary motor cortex. In their experiment, \nvisual analog scale pain symptoms were reduced by 60%, and \nat the 4-month follow-up, the patient still expressed an overall \ndecrease in pain symptoms of 30%.\nThe European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology\n(ESHRE)60 proposes a clear and simple guideline. It rec-\nommends, as a Good Practice Point, to “counsel women with \nsymptoms presumed to be due to endometriosis thoroughly, and \nto empirically treat them with adequate analgesia, combined \nhormonal contraceptives or Progestagens”60. It nevertheless \nstates that “it is clearly a paradox that by recommending empirical\ntreatment in symptomatic (young) women” we might induce \na delay in diagnosing the disease60.\nPage 14 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'Hormones. The guideline recommends prescribing hormonal \ntreatment—combined OCs, progestagens, anti-progestogens, or \nGnRH agonists—“as one of the options, as it reduces endometriosis-associated\npain”60. It also “recommends that clinicians \ntake patient preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs and availability\ninto consideration when choosing hormonal treatment for \nendometriosis-associated pain”60.\nCombined estrogen and progestin OCs are recommended, as \nthey reduce endometriosis-associated dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea,\nand non-menstrual pain, in a continuous protocol. Also, \nvaginal contraceptive rings or transdermal estrogen/ \nprogestin patches are suggested.\nRecommended progestogens are medroxyprogesterone acetate \n(oral or depot), dienogest, cyproterone acetate, and noretisterone\nacetate. Anti-progestogens such as gestrinone are con-\nsidered. The different side effect profiles of each one of those \ndrugs, especially thrombosis and androgenism, should be regarded. \nThe use of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device is \nalso an option. Aside from difficult cycle control in some users, \ndienogest in doses of 2 mg per day results in very effective \npain reduction and control of the disease progression. It can be \nused over prolonged periods of time provided that no recurrent \nbleeding occurs. This is the main cause of discontinuation.\nAnti-hormones. According to the guideline, evidence regarding\ndosage or duration of GnRH agonists is limited. “Clini-\ncians are recommended to prescribe hormonal add-back therapy \nto coincide with the start of GnRH agonist therapy, to prevent \nbone loss and hypoestrogenic symptoms during treatment” since \nthis will not reduce the effect of the pain treatment60. The guidelines\nrecommend giving “careful consideration to the use of GnRH \nagonists in young women and adolescents, since these women \nmay not have reached maximum bone density”60.\nAromatase inhibitors. These options are considered for those \nwho have pain from rectovaginal endometriosis, refractory to \nother medical or surgical treatment. They should be prescribed \nin combination with OC pills, progestagens, or GnRH analogs.\nAnalgesics. The guideline asks a simple question60: “Are analgesics\neffective for symptomatic relief of pain associated with \nendometriosis?” Then it tells us that evidence on the use of \nNSAIDs for endometriosis is scarce. The authors of the guidelines \npresent a referenced publication from 1985 and one study on the \ncyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib (withdrawn from \nthe market in many countries because of severe side effects). \nFor the guideline, NSAIDs have a “favorable effect on primary\ndysmenorrhea and are widely used as a first-line treatment \nof endometriosis-associated pain”60. However, it recommends \nthe use of NSAIDs or other analgesics to reduce endometriosis- \nassociated pain. Clinicians should discuss the associated side \neffects with the patient.\nThe off-label use of a COX-2 inhibitor, etoricoxib, available in \nmany countries could replace rofecoxib. As was demonstrated \nlong ago61, its tolerance and fewer upper gastrointestinal clinical \nevents versus the traditional NSAID diclofenac are notable, \nalthough this difference was not reported in relation to the rare \nand very serious adverse side effects that both drugs can produce.\nPetraglia et al.62 studied rofecoxib back in 2004, before it \nwas banned, in 16 patients versus 12 in a placebo group in a \ndose of 25 mg per day for 6 months. In this group of young \npatients, no significant side effects occurred. Pain relief was \nsignificant and persistent, making this a “safe and low-cost therapy\nfor endometriosis associated pain”62. A future preclinical \nrandomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to replace COX2\ninhibitors in the public awareness as an option, using alter-\nnative drugs such as the previously suggested etoricoxib. The \nPractice Committee of the ASRM states that “first-line medical \ntreatment for pain due to endometriosis is often a nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drug”63. This everyday practice, difficult to \nchange, affects women without a certified diagnosis of \nendometriosis.\nThe Cochrane Library64 recently reviewed the use of NSAIDs \nfor endometriosis-associated pain. The Cochrane Gynecology \nand Fertility Group Specialized Register of Controlled Trials \n(October 2016), MEDLINE (January 2008 to October 2016), \nand the Embase project (January 2016 to October 19, 2016) \nwere analyzed. All RCTs describing the use of NSAIDs for the \nmanagement of endometriosis-associated pain in women of all \nages were included. The available evidence was very low, measured\nby the GRADE system (Grades of Recommendation Assess-\nment, Development and Evaluation, a public domain system \nthat describes evidence as “very low” when the true effect is \nprobably very different from the estimated effect, “low” when \nthe true effect might be very different, “moderate” if the true \neffect is probably close to the estimated effect, and “high” when \nthe true effect is similar to the estimated effect). Comparison of \nNSAIDs (naproxen) versus placebo revealed no evidence of a \npositive effect on pain relief, although women taking NSAIDs \n(naproxen) were less likely to require additional analgesia. \nThose studies provided no data on QOL, effects on daily activities,\nabsence from work or school, need for more invasive treat-\nment, or participant satisfaction with treatment. No judgment as to \nwhether NSAIDs (naproxen) are effective in managing pain caused \nby endometriosis can be made. There is no evidence that one \nNSAID is more effective than another. As shown in other \nCochrane reviews, women taking NSAIDs must be aware that \nthese drugs may cause unintended effects.\nOpioid derivatives such as codeine and tramadol have rarely \nbeen studied for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain. \nMany doctors prescribe them to these women65: “Obstetrician– \ngynecologists reported prescribing a median of 26 opioid \npills across all indications combined”. “Opioid-related deaths \nrecently exceeded motor vehicle accidents as the leading cause \nof injury-related death in the United States”. “In 2015, 2 million \nAmericans had a prescription opioid use disorder, and more than \nhalf of those who reported prescription opioid misuse obtained \nthe drugs through diversion of prescribed medications”. The \nuse of this type of analgesics should be limited to very exceptional\ncases in which other drugs have failed and during the least \nspan of time.\nPage 15 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'What’s new?\nElagolix\nThe elagolix phase III clinical trial66 introduced a new and promising\ntreatment for endometriosis. Oral anti-gonadotrophic agents \nhave a sound future. They arrest the progression of the disease \nand dramatically reduce pain. Relief is fast and significant. \nNew clinical trials for similar drugs are ongoing. In the \npublication of reference, elagolix compared with placebo \nshowed a significant decrease from baseline in the mean pain \nscore. This significant effect was seen at months 3 and 6 of \ntreatment.\nOne adverse side effect, bone density damage67, was dose- \ndependent. Decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) \nfollowing 6 months of treatment with elagolix compared with \nplacebo was significantly different for each elagolix dose. “The \nproportion of participants with lumbar spine BMD decrease \nfrom baseline greater than 3% was also dose-dependent”, as was \nthe case of decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck68.\nCurrent protocols for similar drugs include addback hormonal\ntherapy to minimize the effect on bone density. How long \ncan the patient be treated with GnRH antagonists that produce \nmedically induced menopause-like status? This is a question \nfor the near future since trials provide only up to 12 months of \ntreatments. With addback therapy, these drugs could probably \nbe used for prolonged periods of time.\nOn July 24, 2018, the FDA approved elagolix for the management \nof moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.\nRecent studies69,70 address other advantages: dyspareunia and \npain reduction across a range of baseline characteristics have \nbeen shown to be consistent.\nDuring the first 12 weeks of treatment with either leuprolide\nacetate (LA) or elagolix, subjects had lower estradiol (E2) \nlevels compared with women who received placebo. Estradiol \nlevels were lowest among LA-treated women. The results were \nplacebo = 0 (0%) reduction, elagolix 150 mg = 0 (0%), elagolix \n250 mg = 6 (14%), and LA = 29 (67%). This indicates a need \nfor lower hormonal addback doses, or none, depending on the \ndose administered.\nProellex\nSelective progesterone receptor modulators are a class of drugs \nwith progesterone antagonist activity that may confer therapeutic\nbenefit for reproductive disorders in premenopausal women. \nEndometrial structure, which is dynamically controlled by circulating\nsex hormones, is likely to be perturbed by progesterone \nreceptor modulators through their progesterone antagonist \nproperties.\nA selective progesterone receptor modulator, CDB-4124, telapristone\nacetate (Proellex), was clinically studied recently71. \nIts performance as a treatment for endometriosis was proven. It \nis a drug with progesterone antagonist activity. A major concern \nwas the alteration of the eutopic endometrium. The structure \nof this tissue, dynamically controlled by circulating sex hormones,\nis altered by progesterone receptor modulators through \ntheir progesterone antagonist properties. A group of pathologists \nexamined endometrial histology in 58 premenopausal women \nwhose endometriosis was treated with the progesterone receptor \nmodulator CDB-4124 in daily oral doses of 12.5, 25, or 50 at \n3 and 6 months’ follow-up72. Most of the endometrial biopsies \n(103 of 174 biopsies) contained histologic changes that are not \nseen during normal menstrual cycles. The endometrium was generally\ninactive or atrophic and, less frequently, proliferative or \nsecretory. Some presented anomalies, including formation of \ncystically dilated glands, and secretory changes coexisting with \nmitoses and apoptotic bodies. Increasing daily dose and duration\nmade the cysts predominant and their lining inactive or \natrophic. None of the patients who received CDB-4124 \ndeveloped endometrial carcinoma or hyperplasia while on therapy.\nProellex has been questioned by the FDA because of liver \nenzyme increases shown by patients who received treatment in \nthe endometriosis clinical trial. Clinical trials were halted and \nthe company that developed the drug is now redirecting future \nstudies to vaginal administration. A partial halt of the studies \nhas not yet been reverted by the drug authority.\nUlipristal\nIn his doctoral thesis, Simpson72, after a 3-month treatment course \nwith ulipristal acetate (Esmya) for endometriosis-associated \npain, found a good clinical response in 56% of the studied cohort. \nPost-treatment histological and immunohistochemistry changes \nwere correlated to changes in the macroscopic appearance of \nthe disease and changes in symptom severity. In this descriptive \nobservational cohort study, ulipristal acetate appears to offer an \neffective treatment for endometriosis with histological changes \nin the eutopic endometrium that should be carefully observed. \n“The safety of this compound remains to be elucidated but \nthe results from this pilot study are encouraging and should \nprompt further exploration”, wrote Simpson72.\nA possible relationship with endometrial malignancies and \nsevere liver damage reported excludes it from currently available \nendometriosis drugs. The FDA recently (August 2018) refused, \nonce again, to authorize Esmya (brand name for ulipristal acetate)\nfor human use. The drug had been preliminarily approved \nby the EMA in 2015. In May 2018, the EMA issued a warning \nabout the rare occurrence of liver complications. In June 2018, the \nagency approved its use in the preoperative treatment of fibroids \n(that is, for a short period of time). There could be a possible \nrole for ulipristal acetate in the management of endometriosis: \na surgical pretreatment. In my opinion, long-time use is not guaranteed\nto be safe at the present time. We must keep in mind that \nendometriosis is a benign condition and care should be taken \nwhen prescribing medications with dangerous side effects, \neven if rare and infrequent.\nIn regard to hyperplasia, some authors explain it as a singular\nendometrial alteration induced by progesterone receptor \nmodulators and not a real hyperplasia. This modification of the \nendometrial structure would regress after drug cessation.\nPage 16 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'Resveratrol\nResveratrol, a natural drug derived from grape wine, induces \napoptosis in endometrial stromal cells via the suppression\nof survivin expression.

Only small retrospective observational studies suggest \nthat exercise “might be effective in reducing dysmenorrhea”11. \nWeight reduction or specific dietary interventions have no clearly \ndemonstrated effects except for the fact that diet after surgery, \nwith vitamins, minerals, salts, and lactic ferments, appears to \nbe effective in pain reduction in comparison with hormonal \ntreatment. There is a consensus that gluten-free diets improve \nsymptoms in some women who have endometriosis and \ngastrointestinal complains.\nFertility\nThe opportunity, quality, and extension of the first surgery \nare determinant when fertility is the issue. Milani and Cesana \net al.75 recently evaluated the reproductive prognosis during \nthe first three years after conservative surgery. In a retrospective\nstudy, they surveyed 140 patients operated for endometriosis \n(with histological confirmation). With no other infertility factors,\nthe pregnancy rate in a group of previously infertile patients \nwas 53%: 48 spontaneous pregnancies and 10 with ARTs. Those \npatients who had not sought pregnancy before surgery were \nalso followed and 71% of them became pregnant. Only three \nin a group of 31 required ART. In this series, the prognosis was \nnot related to rASRM stage at surgery or the presence of uni- \nor bi-lateral endometriomas, tubal adhesions, or superficial \nlesions. The pregnancy rate inversely correlated to the pouch of \nDouglas obliteration (with significance, P = 0.05).\nI usually manage my patients by following this simple \nalgorithm76 (Figure 6). This algorithm is proposed in cases \nwhere laparoscopy is indicated for endometriosis-associated \ninfertility. Many patients with suspected endometriosis benefit \ndirectly from ARTs without a prior laparoscopy.\nThe World Consensus for the Current Management of \nEndometriosis11 gives simple directions on how to manage \ninfertile patients with endometriosis: \n1. Principles of laparoscopic surgery for infertility are \nsimilar to those for other symptoms.\nFigure 6. Algorithm proposed by the author for the treatment of endometriosis-associated infertility.

IVF does not appear to increase the risk of recurrence \nof endometriosis.\nFor many authors, at IVF procedures after laparoscopic surgeries\nfor advanced stages of the disease, the number of follicles \nrecruited, access to ovaries at harvest, quality of oocytes, fertilization\nrates, and implantation success are severely compro-\nmised by endometriosis. These patients are difficult to treat by \nIVF, and repeated treatment cycles are the rule in endometriosisassociated\ninfertility.\nImplantation rates are compromised in adenomyosis as well. \nLaparoscopic surgical removal of as much as possible of the \ndisease (including DIE) before IVF could enhance results. The \nresection of adenomyotic nodules, especially those located in the \nposterior uterine wall, when they measure 4 cm in diameter or \nmore, would allow better results at the time of embryo transfer. \nThis is a difficult and laborious surgery which requires delicacy \nand expertise. The uterine wall, as is the case in myomectomies, \nmust be duly repaired in several overlapping planes to allow \na normal developing pregnancy and reduce the incidence of \nuterine ruptures.\nYounes and Tulandi77 recently reviewed adenomyomectomy in \nreproductive-age women. Surgery should be offered when medical\ntreatment is not suitable or effective, especially in the case \nof focal disease. In a review of 10 prospective and 17 retrospective\nstudies comprising 1398 patients, the authors showed that \nexcision is effective for symptom control (pain and hemorrhage) \nand probably also for infertility. Three fourths of those women \nseeking pregnancy conceived after surgery, with or without \nassisted reproductive adjuvant therapies. The best surgical \nprocedure, for this author, is yet to be seen.\nThe possible mechanisms involved in endometriosis-associated \ninfertility have not been completely elucidated78. The oocyte is \nbelieved to have an important role. Oxidative stress events associated\nwith alterations in the peritoneal, serum, or follicular \nmicroenvironments might result in poor oocyte quality. In this \nstudy, the possible mechanisms involved in oocyte quality \nimpairment occurring in early disease are described. Another \nrecent essay79 indicates that oocyte quality is decreased in \nwomen with minimal or mild endometriosis.\nBrugnon et al.80 found that the number of collected oocytes, transfer\nrate, and the rate of cycles with a frozen embryo were lower \nin cases of endometriosis. Also, response to stimulation and \ngood embryo quality cohorts were lower. But, for this group, the \nPage 18 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'implantation, delivery rates, and cumulative live birth rates \nper attempt were like those of controls.\nDeep infiltrating endometriosis\nRoman’s recent survey, which included 1135 patients from 56 \ndifferent health-care centers in France, gives us an updated scenario\nof surgical treatment for DIE81. More than half of the cases \npresented only rectal infiltration. In 36.3%, rectum and colon \nwere affected. Sigmoidal-only lesions were less frequent (6.9%). \nCecum, small bowel, and bladder involvement was even less \nfrequent. In 13.4% of the patients, there was ureteral stenosis\n(6.8% associated with hydronephrosis). Most cases were \noperated by conventional laparoscopy (82.2%). Robotics and \nconventional surgery represented less than 10% of the total. \nHalf of the patients were treated by rectal shaving and 40.4% \nby segmental resection of the rectum and sigmoid colon. Fistulas\nwere rare, in both bowel and ureteral surgeries, and only \none death was reported (after rectal shaving procedures). This \nstudy brings to the surface the relevance of DIE, which is far \nfrom being a rare disease. Interdisciplinary teams can achieve \nsuccessful laparoscopic surgical treatments in most cases \n(9 out of 10).\nIs there a place nowadays for medical treatment of DIE? \nVercellini and Somigliana et al.82 propose a challenging view \nof the importance of medical treatment in many cases of DIE. \nThey begin their article with two controversial citations: (1) \nmedical therapy for rectovaginal and colorectal endometriosis\nhas been found to be ineffective or temporary (the rate of \nrecurrence is as high as 76%) whereas surgical excision is effective\nin relieving pain (Minelli), and (2) one of the main char-\nacteristics of symptoms related to DIE lesions is that they \ndramatically respond to therapeutic amenorrhea (Fauconnier). \nWhom should we believe? “Clinicians and patients should \nknow whether and to what extent medical treatments are effective\nfor DIE, under what circumstances can they be used, and \nif they really constitute an acceptable alternative to surgical treatments”83.\nThe authors state that “different hormones, or hor-\nmonal combinations relieve pain and other symptoms of DIE. \nImprovement in dyspareunia, dyschezia, and bowel complaints \nsuggests that they are efficacious”83.\nFew RCTs have been conducted for DIE medical treatments. \nLow-dose progestogens seem to be the best option and, for these \nauthors, should be the first treatment option (norethindrone \nacetate and dienogest). GnRH with addback hormonal therapy \ncould be used, even as a long-term option in selected cases \nwith high surgical risk, but “conservative or definitive surgery” \nshould be considered. For them, the “contraposition between \nmedical and surgical treatment should be overcome by applying \na stepwise approach”83. Vaginal route could be advantageous \nin the case of rectovaginal lesions. The need to discontinue \nhormonal treatments when pregnancy is sought is an important \nreason to consider other options.\nQuality of surgery\nSurgery should be provided by experts on the disease. Much \nof the recurrence (or persistence) of endometriosis is related to \npoor first surgery quality, incomplete removal of all lesions, \nor wrong attitude at the time of laparoscopy.\nI want to stress the importance of laparoscopic surgery for the \ndiagnosis and primary treatment of endometriosis. Certainty \ncan be achieved only by laparoscopic staging and biopsy (for \nhistological confirmation of the disease). Histology helps to \nmake a better prognosis, according to the activity of the lesions. \nLaparoscopy gives the opportunity to excise all disease present, \nincluding adhesions, peritoneal lesions of all types (blue, red, \nwhite, scars, and peritoneal pockets), endometriomas, and deep \ninfiltrating lesions. Preoperative workup, including contrast MRI, \nwill allow the surgeon to correctly appraise each case before \ntaking the patient to the OR.\nThe treatment of endometriosis requires a delicate and experienced\nsurgeon and, if it is the case, an interdisciplinary team, \nincluding gastrointestinal surgeons or urologists (or both), in \nselected patients. Multidisciplinary pelvic surgeons may be available\nat some institutions, where a reduced number of gynecolo-\ngists operate a large number of patients. In most environments, \nthe number of surgeries per year required to sustain expertise in \nall areas of surgery might be impossible to achieve. Therefore, \ninterdisciplinary surgery proves to be mandatory in most locations.\nA recent online consensus meeting organized by the WES \naddressed the issue of “centers of excellence or expertise” in \nendometriosis and of “surgical experts” in DIE. In a preliminary \npresentation, many options and requirements were suggested to \ndistinguish a surgeon as an “expert” in endometriosis. There is \nstill a long way to go before a final consensus might be achieved. \nSurgical expertise by itself should not be a determinant: real \ninterest in all aspects of endometriosis is required.\nPeritoneal lesions\nPeritoneal lesions should be excised whenever and wherever \npossible. Many of them are, in fact, deep lesions hidden behind \na typical blue, red, or white superficial appearance. The World \nConsensus for the Current Management of Endometriosis11 \ngives the following recommendations: Although RCTs have \nfailed to demonstrate benefit of excision over ablation, excising \nlesions where possible is recommended, especially where pain \nis present (weak).\nAlthough this might be disputed by many, destruction by \nelectrocoagulation or laser does not allow histological study of \nthe lesions, a reliable diagnosis, or the evaluation of the degree \nof functionality of the disease. In some cases, extensive “peritonectomies”\nmust be performed in order to correctly remove \nall disease present (Figure 7).\nThe ESHRE Guidelines clearly state that “at laparoscopy, \ndeeply infiltrating endometriosis may have the appearance of \nminimal disease, resulting in an underestimation of disease \nseverity. Evidence level 3”60.\nTaylor, Horne, and Adamson et al.83 propose that “superficial \nendometriosis lesions present a particular diagnostic dilemma \nPage 19 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'for physicians owing to their heterogeneous visual appearance \nand the fact that non-pigmented peritoneal lesions often \nrepresent highly active endometriotic implants”. This thought \nemphasizes the need for excision and histology proof if a \ncorrect diagnosis of endometriosis is our aim.\nEndometriomas\nSomigliana84, in a recent and very interesting brief article entitled\n“Ovarian reserve, endometriomas, and surgery: research \nmust go on”, clearly synthetizes the current controversy on surgery\nfor endometriomas. With a citation of Muzii, he states that \nthe lower levels of anti-Müllerian hormone—considering it a \nmarker of ovarian reserve—precede surgery, suggesting that \nthe ovarian damage is due at least in part to the endometrioma \nitself and not only the surgical procedure.\nThe size of the endometriomas included in this study exceeds \n5 cm in diameter, possibly indicating that the size counts and \nmoreover that the larger the cyst, the greater the damage either to \nthe ovary structure or to its function.\nIn any case, surgery for endometriomas is an issue that needs \nattention. Regularly, ovarian cysts are assigned by a pathology\ndepartment to be operated by the less trained surgeons \nand, to the best of my knowledge, this is not the case with \nendometriomas. Needless to say, laparoscopy is the best surgical \napproach.\nStripping and removing the cysts, whenever possible, are \nconsidered the best options because they allow lower recurrence \nrates11 and, in the case of infertility, better pregnancy rates. This \nis no easy task and requires expertise and delicate procedures. \nIn my experience, the older cysts are more difficult to remove \nwithout damaging surrounding follicular tissue.\nAgain, the question of centers (and surgeons) of expertise\narises. Surgery for endometriomas should be considered \ncomplex procedures to be carried out only by expert surgeons, \nespecially in younger women who want to become pregnant.\nThe Working Group of the European Society for Gynaecological\nEndoscopy, the ESHRE, and the WES85 make these \nrecommendations: \n1. Separate the ovary with endometrioma from the pelvic \nside wall, to which it usually adheres, by adhesiolisis. \nThis usually results in drainage of the endometrioma. \nIt is important to visualize the ureter at this stage to \navoid damage, as the ovary may be adherent to it. In \nthe presence of dense adherence, start the surgery by \ndissecting the ureter from the healthy tissue proximal \nto the adherence point. Endometriotic tissue on the \npelvic side wall will need to be removed as well. (This \nwill be covered in the subsequent recommendation \non the treatment of peritoneal endometriosis.)\n2. Where the cyst ruptures, extend the opening in the cyst \nwall adequately to expose the cyst cavity. Multiple \nincisions and excessive opening should be avoided \nto prevent damaging the ovarian cortex, functional \novarian tissue, and the hilum. Where feasible, the cyst \nmay be turned inside-out to facilitate further treatment.\n3. When the ovary is not adherent, the incision ideally\nshould be over the thinnest part of the ovarian \nendometriotic surface or, if this is not visible, on the \nanti-mesenteric border.\nThen a dissection plane should be identified, even if this requires \ncutting the side of the cyst until a good cleavage plane is seen. \nThe injection of saline between planes could be of help at the \ntime of the cystectomy. “Once the cleavage plane is identified,\nuse gentle traction and counter-traction with appropriate \ninstruments to dissect the cyst capsule from the ovarian \nparenchyma”86.\nOnly when total cystectomy is impossible, removal of as much \nof the thermal coagulation of the remaining portion as possible \nshould be completed with laser. “Precise spot bipolar coagulation \nis the key to achieve hemostasis, to prevent unnecessary damage \nto healthy tissue”, according to the recommendations86. That is, \ndo a careful surgery avoiding blind coagulation of hemorrhagic \ntissue, which might result in over-coagulation of the ovarian \nilium (Figure 8).\nThe question of whether to close the surgical lodge with \nsutures is a matter of current controversy. We suggest that knots \ncould aid hemostasis and avoid thermal damage and, in large \nendometriomas, give the remaining ovary a better shape for \nhealing. Always use the thinnest fast re-absorbable sutures.\nTo operate or not to operate, that is the question. Current opinions\ndiffer depending on the size of the endometrioma, the age \nof the patient, the need for surgical staging and the treatment of \nother sites of the disease, the desire for pregnancy, and so on. \nSmaller endometriomas (that is, 2 cm in diameter) could be \nspared if IVF is a suitable procedure, but those larger than 4 cm11 \nshould be excised.\nFigure 7. Complete removal of all superficial and hidden lesions \nat the pouch of Douglas. Image is from surgery performed by the \nauthor.\nPage 20 of 28\nF1000Research 2019, 8(F1000 Faculty Rev):529 Last updated: 23 APR 2019\n', 'Ovarian reserve is more affected by recurrent surgeries in the \nsame ovary. Thus, a delicate and complete cystectomy is the \nbest procedure, as noted before.\nDrainage and coagulation or laser destruction is not the best \ntechnique, since it also affects surrounding ovarian tissue and \nis linked to a higher recurrence (or persistence) rate.\nThe singer, not the song, say Muzii and Miller86. For them, the \nquality of the surgery, and not surgery itself, is important. “Surgery\nis the gold standard treatment for ovarian endometriomas, \nbut it should be performed with proper techniques by \nspecifically trained surgeon”86.\nDeep infiltrating endometriosis\nA surgical chapter by itself, DIE remains the most complex surgical\nprocedure in the domain of endometriosis. Four different \nscenarios are encompassed in DIE: bladder infiltration, lateral \ndisease (with or without ureteral compromise), sigmoid affectation,\nand rectovaginal nodules. All of those surgeries, except \nfor some minor bladder lesions, require expertise and, in many \ncases, interdisciplinary surgical teams, including gastrointestinal \nsurgeons and urologists.\nBladder infiltration needs to be resected in total, even if the bladder\nmust be opened and later sutured. Special attention must \nbe given no to include the ureteral mouths in the resection or \nsuture. Most bladder surgeries can be accomplished by a \nregular expert gynecological laparoscopic surgeon.\nWhen ureters are compromised, extraluminal nodules are usually\neasily removed by delicate surgery. If the ureteral wall is \naffected, a segmental resection is required, followed by immediate\nanastomosis, a complex surgery that should be performed only \nby expert laparoscopic surgeons. This is a rare location of \nthe disease and is frequently accompanied by homolateral \nhydronephrosis of different degrees. Correct preoperative diagnosis\nis required. This can be accomplished by US (hydronephro-\nsis), contrast MRI, and CAT (ureteral stops or deviations) scans. \nDouble-“J” catheters after the anastomosis prevent filtrations \nand suture dehiscence.\nColorectal endometriosis is the most frequent location of DIE. \nNodules can be found all along the rectosigmoid colon, from as \nnear as the anal sphincter (rare) to as far as the lower sigmoid \ncolon. Different techniques have been proposed over the years \nby many expert surgeons. Which one is appropriate in each case \nis the most important decision to be made, before or during \nlaparoscopy.\nIn a recent review, Darai et al.87 compared conservative surgery\n(disc resection) with radical surgery (segmental resection) \nin 31 patients. The conservative strategy had a shorter OR time \nand hospital stay (P = 0.03 and P = 0.002, respectively) versus \ncolorectal resection. Complication rates were similar for the two \ngroups, but postoperative voiding was higher in the resection \ngroup.\nRoman et al.88 studied 122 consecutive patients managed by surgery\nin a follow-up that ranged from 1 to 6 years. The patients \nwere treated with the authors’ technique of rectal shaving, in \nwhich the endometriotic nodule is dissected from the large bowel \nwithout compromising its structures. Sixty-eight patients were \noperated using US scalpel and 54 with plasma energy. In this \nFigure 8. Endometrioma cystectomy. A correct dissection plane is mandatory for a careful cystectomy of endometriomas and must be \nclearly identified. Whenever possible, incision should be made at a site opposite the ovarian vascular pedicles.

Roman et al. state that, with \nthis evidence, rectal shaving is a valuable treatment with a low \nincidence of postoperative complications.\nCeccaroni et al.89 recently presented a literature review that \nincluded 38 studies where they present the data regarding recurrence\nof colorectal endometriosis after surgery. A conflict they \nreport is that the recurrence data vary among the studies, especially\nbecause there are different appraisals of what recurrence is \nand there are different lengths of follow-up reported (in general,\n2 to 4 years). As suspected, in the longer studies, more \nrecurrences occur.\nThose authors cite recurrence rates that range from 2% to \n43.5%. They found three risk factors for recurrence of colon \nDIE: age, body mass index (BMI), and type of surgery. Younger \nage is a risk factor. Higher BMI and incomplete surgery are \nthe other two factors they identified.\nIn their review, they found four studies that correlated histopathological\nspecimen margins (with disease or disease-free) \nwith the risk of recurrence (38% with compromised margins).\nIn the lower rectal presentations (2–3 cm from the anal sphincter),\ntransient colostomy is recommended. In the higher loca-\ntions, this is rarely required. All procedures, in general, can be \naccomplished by laparoscopy. Interdisciplinary surgical teams \nare recommended except in those cases where gynecological \nlaparoscopists routinely perform shavings, disc resections, or \nsegmental colectomies (university hospitals and so on).\nZupi et al.90 addressed the issue of pregnancy complications \nand DIE. In a multicenter, observational cohort study that \nincluded a group of women with incomplete previous surgery for \nendometriosis and a control group, they analyzed the results \nof spontaneous or ART pregnancies. With a media of 2 cm in \ndiameter, the persistent nodules were linked to these obstetrical \noutcomes: higher risk of preterm delivery (P = 0.0001), placenta\nprevia (P <0.0001), placental abruption (P = 0.0392), and \nhypertension (P = 0.0129).\nBack in 2009, Brosens et al.91 described a relationship between \nendometriosis and spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy\n(SHiP). They identified the disease as a major risk factor. \nIn their literature review, which included 13 cases of endometriosis-associated\nSHiP, seven women had a diagnosis of DIE. \nThe controversy on DIE and the need (or not) for surgery before \nseeking pregnancy should come to an end, and patients should \nbe counselled on the risks of pregnancy prior to the resection \nof DIE nodules. Surgery is mandatory as a first step in the treatment\nof endometriosis-associated infertility in the presence \nof DIE (Figure 9).\nHow to understand endometriosis\nAfter reading hundreds of publications on endometriosis, I realized\nthat I began to understand this complex disease only when \nwe started to share meetings and workshops with patients. No \nbook, no online publication, no medical meeting can explain the \nintriguing pathways of endometriosis alone. Those who have \nit can tell a lot about it.\nI have learned as much from them as from many extended \narticles written by enlightened authors. Science is not to be \ndiscarded. On the contrary, the facts and data it teaches give \nus the possibility to better understand those who have it.\nThe pain-ridden young woman who wanders from one doctor’s\noffice to another, and then another, with no answers to her \nplight, should be the main subject of concern to those interested \nin endometriosis. To some extent, it is an entirely different \nmedical specialty, not just a gynecological disorder.\nAs noted before, the disease probably starts at birth and could \neven be present at menopause. Pain usually starts at adolescence. \nAt that age, girls skip school during menstrual periods in the \nmost severe cases. Many of those who experience less pain are \nconfronted with unexpected infertility later in life.\nIt is not just her. It is her family, her partner, and her daughter \nand sons who are confronted by the distress and disorientation \nlinked to endometriosis. Why me? How did I get it? How \ncan I cope with it? \nTake your time, meet with patients’ groups and societies, \naccompany them in their public appearances, meet with them \nSaturday mornings at your office, and listen to them. In time, \nyou will begin to understand endometriosis! As an example, \nlet me share images from recent meetings and other activities\nwith endometriosis patients held by our interdisciplinary \nprofessional team (Figure 10–Figure 12).\nFigure 9.
