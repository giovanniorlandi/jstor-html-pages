The latest news\nfrom the front adds little to the pub\nlic knowledge of the convoy disaster.\nNo credence is given to reports that\nthe Boers numbered between 8,000 and\n10,000 men. The general belief is\nthat there could not have been more\nthan half that number, but the men\nJact that even so many as half could\nhave been collected so near headquar\nters without the knowledge of the\nBritish commanders provokes much\nuneasy criticism. The disaster is re\ngarded as a direct reesult of the in\nability of Gen. French to cut off the\ncommando of Gen. Olivier and the\nother commandoes when escaping\nfrom the Orange river.\nLord Methuen\'s difficulties are ap\nparently increasing. He has Boer\nlaagers or guerrilla bands on three\nEides of him and he will be obliged\nto watch carefully his cornmunica\nl.on with Orange river.\nA special dispatch from Bloemfon-\ntein reports that the water supply of\nthe place has been cut off. This 13 j\nthe natural consequence of the Boer ;\nsuccess at the waterworks. But the\nauthorities are hopeful that the\nstrong reinforcements sent by the\ncommander-in-chief will promptly\nremedy this. It is evident from Lord\nBoberts dispatch that a big engage\nment is in progress. Although it it\ndifficult to estimate the number of\nBritish engaged, they probably ex\nfeed even the 8,000 or 10,000 men\nwhich the Boers are estimated to\nnumber.\nThe Lorn of the Conroy Described.\nLondon, April 3. The Bloemfontein\ncorrespondent of the Daily Chronicle,\ntelegraphing Sunday, and describing\nthe loss of the convoy, says: "The\nBoers opened with a murderous Cre,\nIt was tsimply slaughter. The Kaffir\ndrivers of the convoy ran away, leav\ning their teams and it was impossible\nfor our men to hit the hidden enemy,\nvur gunners fought bravely trying to\nsave the guns, but our people were\ngreatly hampered by the Kaffirs, who\nran hither and thither looking for\ncover from the fearful fire that\npoured in on all sides. Meanwhile the\nenemy Avere hotly pressing Col. Broad\nwood, whose mounted troops were\ncompletely surrounded.\n"The British showed magnificent\nbravery. The officers were quite cool\nand composedly, directed operations.\nThe opportune arrival of reinforce\nments saved Col. Broad wood from an\nnihilation. The water supply was out\nand the pumping- gear destroyed, as\nfvell 33 the field telegraph. One hun\ndred wagons were lost through the\ncowardice of the Kaffir drivers. It is\nreported that two guns have been re\ncaptured. The whole force is retiring\ngn Bloemfontein."\nPoers Active Along the Yaal Rver.\nKimberley, April 3. There la great\nBoer activity along the Vaal river.\nAbout 6,000 burghers have assembled\nat various points between Fourteen\nStreams and Christiana.

Gen. Otis haa\ncabled the war department, probably\n"with a view to correcting impressions\nhat exist in this country as to the\nstate of the insurrection in the Phil\nipplues, a summary of the result of\nthe development of the campaign\nsince the first of the calendar\nyear. Ilis figures go far toward\noffsetting the belief that exists\nn some quarters that since the adop\ntion of guerrilla methods of warfare\nthe insurgents have inflicted sub\nstantial loss upon American arms in\ncomparison with the punishment\nwhich they have themselves received.\nA significant sentence in the reporf\ndifferentiates insurgents and la?\ndrones, showing that Otis has taken\ncognizance of the fact that a consider\nable number of hostiles are not sol\ndiers under the rules of war, and\nmay not expect the same treatment.\nThe report, which is dated Manila,\nApril 3, is as follows:\nSince January 1. 124 skirmishes ia the\nPhilippines tave been reported, mostly\npUg-ht affairs.

It Is ru\nmored that Democratic Judge Cantrill\nwill instruct the Franklin county\ngrand jury to return indictments\nagainst republican Gov. W. S.

Bev. Wash\nington Gladden, the eminent Congre\ngational clergyman, was yesterday\nelected to the city council from the\nSeventh ward, defeating C. E.

Colby, the con\nvention town, has been the political\nstorm center this week. The populist\nconvention met at 11 o\'clock, and\nCharles IL Nichols of Osborne county,\nwas chosen temporary chairman, and\nF. B. Smith of Russel coutny, tempor\nary secretary, and at the afternoon ses\nsion the temporary organization was\nmade permanent.\nThe democrats assembled there on\nMonday, April 2, and named Hon. Tul\nly Scott of Oberlin, as the man of their\nchoice for congress. They also appoint\ned a conference committee of l2, one\nfrom each county of the district, to\nmeet the populist conference commit\ntee to arrange a fusion of the reform\nforces.\nThe populists met at Colby, April 3,\nand had full convention of B20 mem\nbers. In the eastern part of the dis\ntrict Dr. John B. Dykes of Smith coun\nty, had been put to the fore as a con\ngressional candidate, and many of the\neastern counties of the district had\ncentered on him. Even in the prelim\ninary organization their strength was\nshown, and the vote stood approxi\nmately 4.0 to SO, or two to one.\nThe western half of the district is\nthinly settled, and these counties had\nsmaller delegations on the basis of\nvotes cast. But territorially, the west\nhalf was solid for fusion with the dem\nocrats, and on the first ballot for con\ngressman, Scott had 40 votes to Dykes\'\n47, there being other scattering bal\nlots. There was a lively passage of arms,\nboth in preliminary and permanent or\nganization, between these two ele\nments. It was apparent that tCe Dykes\nfaction had forestalled any possible\nfusion with the democrats.\nA conference committee of 22 was\nselected to confer with the democrats\nbut after several meetings the attempt\nto compromise and arrange a fusion\ndeal was abandoned and Dykes was\nnominated by the populists, aud Scott\nby the democrats.\nThis makes it a three-cornered fight\nwith the chances of election in favor\nof Eeeder, as also the jeopardizing of\npopulist state senators and represen\ntatives, to say nothing of the county\ntickets, in many of the counties in this\ncongressional district.\nThe democrats offered to concede to\nthe populists all the 22 representatives\nand four state senators in the congres\nsional district, allowing, however, local\nadjustment of the fusion arrangement\nto meet local conditions. The\npopulists made a reverse proposal,\nthe democrats to endorse the populist\ncongressman, the populists to give the\ndemocrats the state senators and the\nrepresentatives.\nOn this proposition, upon a canvass\nof the counties of the district, it was\nfound that the populists were not in a\nposition to deliver the goods in the\nmajority of counties, because of local\nconditions, or of candidates already in\nthe field, In other words, so far as the\nSixth district was concerned, the pop\nulists required the democratic endorse\nment of the populist congressman and\npractically offered nothing to the dem\nocrats in return. The compromise, of\ncourse, failed.\nThe counties in the east part of the\ndistrict that had large delegations there\nfor Dykes had nothing to offer to the\ndemocrats, and offered nothing for the\ndemocratic endorsement of their can\ndidate. These conferences with the demo\ncrats were characterized by friendli\nness and courtesy on both sides, and it\nis a pity that political friends could not\nget together, all because of personal\npreferences and personal ambitions.\nThe democratic contention was a very\nreasonable one. In the populist camp\nit was formerly eaid, "let the office\nseek the man." Now, it is "the man\nseeking the cfSce,\',, or others seeking\nit for him. This was what defeated\nI fusion.\nWHY FUSlOil FAILED.\nRepublican Money a Factor in the Sixth.\nDistrict DUasreetnent Between\nPopulists and Democrats.\nIt is not a difficult proposition to\n; state why fusion of populist and demc\n\' cratic forces in the Sixth Kansas con\ngressional district failed. N. B. ilc\nCormick, cf Bhillipsburg, stated to a\nprominent Goodland democrat at Colby\nduring the conventions, that fusion\n, would fail and gave his reasons in about\nj the following language:\n"This convention will cost me 5100.\nI have 15 delegates here and am paying\nf2 per day apiecs for their board. No!\nIt will not cost me quite 5100, as Mr.\nLow gave me transportation for 11\ndelegates.\nMCormick\'s delegates in the popul\n. ist convent!;:! were tgiizst faii;n and\nwent for DjVS3 f3r c-- rres?-n.

The populist\nsenatorial convention to-day nominat\ned Selden G. Hopkins, editor of the\nIloxie Palladium, as their candidate for\nstate senator.\nThe democratic oonrention, also as\nsembled here, endorsed Hopkins.\nCANDY FOR FIGHTERS.\nUncle Sam Bias Shipped to the Philippines\nSO Tons of Sweets, Which Are la\nGreat Demand.\nWashington, April 1. There is a\ndemand for an increase of the sugar\nration to the soldiers in the Philip\npinees, and the commissary depart\nment is preparing to meet it. The al\nlowance now is 13 pounds to 100\nrations, and this will probably be in\ncreased to 20 pounds. The depart\nment has just made a shipment of 50\ntons of such swells as are in demand\nthere by the soldiers, including a large\norder of the best candj intermixed\nwith a good allowance of chocolates.\nThi3 order will le followed by a larger\none, and chocolates will again hold\nfirst 4ace- These confections are of\ncoursenot a part of the army ration,\nbut are for purchase by the ofScera\nand soldiers.\nWANT LIQUOR KEPT OUT.\nLarge Delecation Walts on Hoase Commit,\ntee In Advocacy of a Prohibition Meas\nQre for Oar New Possessions.\nWashington, March 31. A large del\negation from New York, Philadelphia\nand other cities appeared before the\ninsular affairs committee of the house\nFriday in behalf of the bill introduced\nby Mr. Gillette, of Massachusetts, to\nprohibit the importation into, sale or\nmanufacture of intoxicating liquors\nin Porto Rico, Hawaii or the Philip\npines\'. They adduced many facts to\nprove that esecially in the Philip\npines there had been a Jarge increase\nin the sale of intoxicating liquors since\nthe advent of the Americans with\ndrunkenness and other attendant\nevils and argued that entire prohibi\ntion was the only remedy for the con\ndition of affairs existing and prospec\ntive.

The effort was\nrenewed to secure the construction of\none or more of the new ships in gov\nernment yards, but the matter did not\n"reach a vote. The bill carries ap\nproximately $51,000,000.\nSad Accident Near Fort Scott, Kan.\nFort Seott.\'Kan., April 4.

The child was\nburned to death and the father\'s\nhands were so badly burned that he\ncan never "use them a train.\nLes Liquor to the Islands.\nWashington, April 1. There has\nbeen a large decrease in the value of\nwines, malt and spirituous liquors ex\nported from the United States into\nCuba, Porto Bico and the Philippines\nsince they came into the possession\nof this government. During 1S93 and\n1S9D the amount was just half what it\nwas in 1S30, when ?2,S34,436 was the\nvalue cf the imports of this kind into\nthese islands.\nDebt Decreased la March.\nWashington, April 4.

Conven\ntion .halL the pride of Kansas City,\nthe magnificent auditorium that has\nipread the city\'s fame, is a mass of\ncharred and smoldering ruins. It\ncaught fire at one o\'clock Wednesday\nafternoon and burned with such fury\nthat in 15 minutes it was almost\ntotally destroyed. When the fire de\npartment arrived the magnificent\nstructure was a roaring furnace, filled\nwith destroying flames, beyond the\npower of man to subdue. A stiff\nwind was blowing from the southeast\nand the Lathrop school and the\nSecond Presbyterian ehrmb, on Cen\ntral street, and the Williamson block,\njust north of the hall an Twelfth\nstreet quick- caught fire and were\ndestroyed. The burning brands were\ncarried by the wind, setting several\nresidences on fire and the firemen\nbuckled down to fight a hard battle\nagainst strong odd3. People turned\naway sorrowfully from the spectacle\nof the doomed temple and the ques\ntion was oft repeated, "Can it be re\nbuilt in time for the national Dem\nocratic convention?\nThe heat was terrific, forcing peo\nple back even beyond the fire Hues\nwhich had been quickly stretched on\nall the surrounding streets. The fire\nran up and down the steeple of the\nchurch, festooning it with garlands\nof red flames. In less than half an\nhour after the fire started the roof of\nthe Convention hall fell in and the\nbrick corinthian columns on the\nThirteenth and the Central street\nfacades of the building tottered a few\nmoments and fell outward to the\nstreet with a terrible crash. The im\nmense steel trusses fell inward witha\nmuffled roar, sending showers of\nparks high into the air. The steel\ntrusses are lying in a heap, twisted\nout of shape hy the terrible heat.\nThe solid masonry foundation walls\nalone withstood the flames and formed\nthe walls of a furnace within which\nall the combustible material burned\nfiercely. So rapid was the progress\nof the flames that the entire hall was\non fire and beyond relief within five\nminutes after the fire was discovered.\nThe floors, balconies and all the in\nterior works of the building were con\nstructed of soft pine wood and was\nmost inflammable. The arrangement\nof the hall made it like a vast furnace\nin which the woodwork was consumed\nrapidly. The cause of the fire i3 un\nknown. It started near the engine\nroom in the northeast corner of the\nbuilding, but there has been no fire\nin the furnace since Monday night\nwhen the democratic rally was held.\nFires were drawn and scraped yester\nday and no fire of any kind was sup\nposed to be in the hall to-day. Smoking\nwas not permitted, but the rule was\nfrequentlj violated. Four carpenters\nand a plumber were at work in the\nbuilding to-day putting a flooring on\npart of the interior roof garden. It\nIs not known if the fire was due to\nthe carelessness of some of these\nworkmen.\nAs the flames swept across Central\ntreet the y caught Vn the roof of La\nthrop school. The school children\nhad just returned from the noon re\ncess and the teachers, when they saw\nihat Convention hall was doomed,\nhurried the children out of the build\ning. Policeman Lewis helped get the\nchildren out, but the drill they have\nbeen taught in connection with their\nstudies came into good play in the\nemergency. The children were pushed\nback outside the fire lines and rnin\nfrled with the big crowd in the\nstreets.\nThe Central Presbyterian church at\nthe corner of Thirteenth and Central\nstreets went next. It burned with\nremarkable fury. The home of the\npastor, the Lev. Dr. II. D. Jenkins,\nnext door, a substantial brick house\nworth about $7,000, was swept up in\nthe flames Jake a bit of kindling.\nAt two o\'clock the row of buildings\non Twelfth street north of Conven\ntion hall were all on fire and burn\ning so fiercely that the firemen no\ntified the inmates to move their prop\nerty out, as the whole row was sure\nto burn to the ground. In this row\nwere the buildings 215, 217, 213, 221,\n223 and 223 West Twelfth street, all\nof them boarding houses.\nW. A. Kelly, the contractor, de\nclared that Convention hall could be\nrebuilt in 00 days. Eut he thought\n, the construction of the roof would\nhave to be materially different from\nthat of the destroyed buildiDg, owing\nto the difficulty in securing the neces\nsary seel. He said he could guaran\ntee to nave up a substantial building\nbefore the national democratic con\nvention was called. The insurance on\nthe building amounts to $153,000, and\n. Is divided among 30 or 75 companies\nvith agents in Kansas City.\nClocJ-tatl T7-SH?! t"re f n vr r\nEaengerfest building has just sent a\ntelegram to Chairman Jones, of the\ndemocratic national convention, offer\ning the hall for the democratic na\ntional convention in case it is con\ncluded that the convention must be\ntaken from Kansas City. The hall\nseats 15,003 people and is accessible\nfrom five lines of street cars, being\nlmiles from the postofSce building\'.\nHAY GET TOGETHER.\nPlan on Foot to Cnlt Into One National\nParty the Antl-Fuslon Populists\nand Social Democrats.\nTerre Haute, Ind March 31. Ac\ncording to persistent report here, the\nhome of Eugene V. Debs, nominee of\nthe social democracy, a movement is\nwell under way to amalgamate the\nsocial democratic party and that\nelement of the populist party known\nas the "middle-of-the-roaders. It is\nsaid that the plan now is to unite the\ntwo parties at the middle-of-the-road\npopulist convention at Cincinnati in\nMaj\' and form one strong organization\nof the two. This may be accom\nplished by the nomination of Eugene\nV. Debs, of this city, for president\nfcy the populists. He has already been\nnominated by the social democracy\nfor president and the amalgamation\nwhich, has been looked forward to\nfor some time by a certain element\nIn both parties will, it Is felt, be ef\nfected more easily at the the coming\nconvention than at any other time.\nWARNED AS TO CUBA.\nThe War Department Anxious to Restrain\nAmericans Without Resources from\nGoing- to the Island.\nWashington, April 3. The war de\npartment has been obliged to sound\na note of warning to restrain over\nconfident Americans from flocking in\nto Cuba without resources. Accord\ning to the advices received by the de\npartment, Cuba is no place for a man\nwithout money. With some capital\nthere is large opportunity for returns,\nbut otherwise even willing working\nmen and clerks cannot secure em\nployment and must soon come to\ngrief. Secretary Hoot mentioned the\nfate of some of the Americans who\nhad gone to Cuba as parts of alleged\n"colonics" as particularly hard, and\nIf it shall appear proper to extend\nrelief at all it may be that he will\nauthorize those who are now suffer\ning in thse colonies to be brought\nhome in the transports.\nREED ELECTED MAYOR.\nDemocrats Carry Kansas City by a iGood\nMajority, Electing- the Entire Ticket\nand Majority of Aldermen.\nKansas City, Mo., April 4.

The statement was\nto the Washington correspondent cf\nthe New York World and was publisl Crd\nin New York this morning.\nAdmiral Dewey confirmed the inter\nview, but refused to make any further\n6tatement. Dewey\'s announcement h3\nfallen flat here, although it is the cue\nsubject discussed by the politicians to\nday. Not a member of congress inter\nviewed on the subject spoke favorably\nof his candidacy. Many did not credit\nit until Dewey stated that the interview\nwas an accurate one. The democratic\nleaders postively predict that Dewey\nwill not be nominated at Kansas City\nand that his candidacy will in no wise\nhamper Mr. Bryan\'s chances. They say\nDewey is not a democrat.\nOn the other hand the republicans\nrefuse to claim him, and as the admiral\nhas never declared himself no oaa\nknows whether he i3 a democrat or a\nrepublican.\nMI wrote the interview myself," said\nhe, "and gave it exclusively to the paper\nthat first mentioned me a3 a presiden\ntial possibility."\nFollowing i3 the admiral\'s interview\nas published in the New York World:\nAdmiral Dewey authorizes the World\nto announce to the American people\nthat after mature reflection and in re\nsponse to the ernest entreaties from\nall parts of the country his former de\ndision, not under any circumstances to\nrun for the presency, is rescinded.\nAdmiral Dewy said:\n"I realize that the time has arrived\nwhen I must definitely define my po\nsition. "When I arrived in this country last\nSeptember I expected then that noth\ning would induce mo to be a candidate\nfor the presidency.\n"Since then, however, I have had tha\nleisure and inclination to study the\nmatter and have reached a different\nconclusion, inasmuch as so many as\nsurances have come to me from my\ncountrymen that I would be accept\nable as a candidate for this great office.\nIf the American people want me for\nthis high office I shall be only too will\ning to serve them.\n"It is the highest honor in the gift cf\nthis nation; what citizen would refuse\nit?\n"Since studying this subject I am\nconvinced that the office of president\nis not such a very difficult one to fill,\nhis duties being mainly to e\'xecute tha\nlaws of congress.\n"Should I be chosen for this exalted\nposition I would execute the laws of\ncongress as faithfully as I have always\nexecuted the orders of my superiors.1\nTRIED TO KILL TEE PRINCE.\nA Man Fires Two fehots at Wales TVhlle\nin Brussels but Itottt Go \'Wide\nof Their Mark.\nBrussels, April 4.

Mr. Cleveland advo\ncated gold bonds when the $200,000,000\nwas issued under his administration,\nand said that $16,000,000 could be saved\nto the government because the syndi\ncates wauld pay that much more for\nthem if payable in gold. Taking this\nas a basis the refunding scheme if ex\nchanged on face value would give\n550,000,000 to the bond holders.

It appears that the military governor\nof Guam, Naval Captain Leary, has\nbeen recalled because he embarrased\nthe administration by too much Amer\nican government. The following is a\npress dispatch sent out from Washing\nton, dated March 31:\nGovernor Leary, of Guam, is net a bigger man\nthan the nary department or the admlstration.\nHe may hare issued proclamations abolishing\'\nslavery and polygamy in Guam and be may\nbare unwittingly extended the constitution of\nthe United States orer tbe island, but the nary\ndepartment and tbe administration will not\nstand for it\nGen. Miles embarrased McKinley by\nhis proclamation in Porto Rico, Leary\nin Gaum and Wood in Cuba. Otis\ndon\'t do that way in the Philippines.\nHe executes Filipinos.\n"Who Get the Money?\nSaid Mr. McKinley at the recent Ohio\nbanquet in New York city, referring to\nour great and prosperous trade with\nforeign nations:\n"We buy from all of them and sell\nto all of them, and our sales exceeded\noar purchases in the past two years by\nover $1,000,000,000."\nOne thousand million of dollars\nahead on foreign business onght to\nand probably does satisfy the citizen\nwho lives and grows fat on presidential\nand administration statistics. But the\nman who does not find statistics a\nsatisfactory table delicacy naturally\nwants to know who gets this billion of\ndollars.\nStandard Oil gets $30,000,000 per an\nnum, Carnegie $40,000,000, credit capi\ntal, commonly known as "water, wild\ncat" and various other appropriate\ndesignations, get the rest of it and\nleave the producer and the nation still\nin debt for as much more. Whatever\nis left to the farmer, the worker, the\npoor, etc., must be immediately paid\nout in taxes, the total of which exceeds\nthis great and gloriou3 prosperity by\nhalf a billion dollars. Where is all\nthis money and who gets it? remains\nan unanswerable conundrum. We\nknow we do not get it, for we are ship\nping more gold than we import. Mr.\nMcKinley\'s billion of dollars gain\non foreign trade is in the same box\nwith his other fabricated prognostica\ntions and badges of prosperity.\nBryan\'s Popularity.\nRecently one of the boldest, shrewd\nest and best-informed republican lead\ners of the middle west said: "If the\nelection were to be held now, Bryan\nwould be the next president of the\nUnited States."\nThis is undoubtedly true, but there\nneed be no limitation as to the time\nwhen the election should be held.\nBryan will be elected next November,\nfor he has steadily grown in public\nesteem since his candidacy in 1S0G, and\nMcKinley has fallen greatly in popu\nlarity. On the Porto Rican issue McKinley\nwill lose all the states in the middle\nwest and his strength among the people\nof the east has been badly shaken.\nSpeaking of present conditions, the\nWashington carrespandent of the New\nYork Evening Post says:\n"On the Porto Rican tariff issue the\nrepublicans would lose Indiana, and\nnot only Indiana, but also Illinois.\nRunning on that platform, McKinley\nwould find the chances against him in\nMichigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\nI think that Ohio would be a doubtful\nstate on that issue."\nAs an illustration of the change of\nsentiment regarding McKinley and\nBryan since 1S06, tbe correspondent\nmentioned two business men of the\nfirst rank in Chicago whose name are\nwell known in the commercial world.\nBoth of these men were large contrib\nutors to the republican campaign fund\nfour years ago. "Both of them tell me,"\nhe says, "that they will not give a cent\nto the republicans this year, but that\nall they have to contribute will go to\nthe Bryan campaign fund."\nIt is no wonder the administration\nforces are panic stricken over the mag\nnitude of the Porto Rican issue. It is\nnot a mere matter of a few pennies\nextra taxation, but of the fundamental\nprinciples of American government.\nIt has" taken hold of the people as\nnothing since the slavery issue.\nOn all the issues before tbe country\nat the present time William J. Bryan\nstands as the champion of the people\nand the people know and appreciate\nthis fact.\nHe opposes the oppressive trusts\nfavors free trade for Porto Rico, de\nnounces imperialism, stands fearlessly\nin favor of bimetallism.\nOn these issues he will make his\nappeal to the people next November\nand the response will be hi3 election as\npresident of the United States.

He has introduced a bill to\nmake wholesale reduction in tbem so far as\nshipping is concerned. The bill is for "free\nships," or in other words to reduce wages in all\nthe ship yards in the United States and in all\nthe industries that contribute to ship building.\nTho object of the article is to make it\nappear that democrats are for low\nwages and republicans for high wages.\nIf this were a fact, under republican\nrule there should have been a large\nadvance. But such is not the case\naccording to the latest statistics. The\naverage daily wages of skilled labor in\nmechanical and manufacturing employ\nments is about 21.50.\nIn the World Almanac for 1900, at\npage ICS, the following is given: "Ac\ncording to the census of 1S00, the num\nber of persons engaged in manufactures\nin the United States was 4,712,023; the\nwages earned were, r233,21G,529." Thus\nthe average yearly wages earned was,\n54S4.43; the average daily wages, $1.53.\nThis was skilled labor ten years ago\nFrom the latest statistical reports for\n1000, the average daily wages for skil\nled mechanical labor is now only 31.46,\nand this under protected industries.\nThis report makes no allowance for\nmen out of employment nor for com\nmon labor. The boast that "protective\ntariff" protects labor is false. It pro\nprotects corporations and lets labor\nlook out for itself. Now along with\nthi3 remember the $12,000,000 annual\nprofit of the Carnegie Steel company,\nand the ?20,000,OCO quarterly dividend\nof the Standard Oil company. The\nvaunted "protection" of the republican\nparty makes trusts possible, which in\nturn make the rich richer and the\npoor poorer.\nAbout free ships; it is a fact that\nAmerican ship yards have large orders\nin advance xf their capacity to build\nthem. And what makes it costly to\nbuild ships in the United States is the\nrapacity of the steel trust and not the\nwages paid. Congress and the navy\ndepartment have tried to bring the\nCarnegie people to terms and have\nfailed. The republican party is the\nmother of thi3 and all other trusts.\nThe trusts pocket the profits and the\n? rr vWr 1 r7 Ci: PCV\nf . v i . -r ;\nS\'.z-.-.J.

Van Vlissengen\ncannot overcome the scruples of Aletha\nand the little Dunkard girl will not\nmarry him because he has "Too Much\nMoney" and her religion frowns cn\nwealth, so he returns to the city with\nout her. Aletha, however, persuades\nher mother to take her to the city to\nlearn to paint. Van Vlissengen refers\nher to Ponsonby, who having no other\npupils, Van Vlissengen is compelled to\nsupply the appearance of a class by\ndressing as a girl. In this disguise he\ngains the consent of the old lady to\nmarry Aletha, by such diplomacy as is\nonly fair in love and war.\nTickets are now on sale at the Ernst\njewelry store.\nfemale Masonary a 1 Lease.\nThe Ladies of the Eastern Star will\npresent the above at the opera house\nWednesday evening, April 11.

In regard to the old low\nare making on Clothing, we must admit the fact, which is plain to\nit is not good business policy to sell good staple stuff below actual\nvalue, as we are now doing; but there are sometimes good reasons lor doing\nthings seemingly unbusinesslike. Last year we bought thousands of dollars\nworth more of Clothing than we need or any other Clothing house needs in\nwestern Kansas for regular stock. We made heavy purchases last year\nto anticipate the big advances later. Now to sell on the basis of what we\npaid, we feel justified in doing so if we sell more Clothing, and that is what\nwe expect to do.

"I have a reputation for piety\nand chaste language to preserve."\nSomebody showed Mr. Reed a copy\nof a Manila paper in which appeared\nthis paragraph:\n"The difference between Tom Reed\nand Billy Mason is that when Tom\nReed says he will resign he resigns."\n"Ah," said Mr. Reed reflectively, "a\ngreat journalist is evidently wasting\nhis talents on the Filipinos." j\n"It\'s a pity you are not in congress,\'\nhe was told by au admirer. 1\nuThink so? asked Reed disinterest\nedly. I\nl"es, indeed; they need you down\nhere to tell them what to do." j\n"Well," drawled Reed, "they don\'t\nseem to need me to tell them what to\ndo." i\nIt is said that when Mr. Reed was\ntaking luncheon with Senator Bever\neriige the other day, and the discus\nsloa turned to Porto Rican muddle,\nReed was heard to remark:\n"You have got into just the trouble\npeople always get into when they try\nto govern somebody else.

HELENA.\nDenounces the Administration a Uel\nUnfriendly to a Mater Republic De\nfeat of Hoers lilovr at Rr public.\nCongressman Suitzer cf New York,\nin a recent speech in Congress, de\nnounced the administration for its at\ntitude on the resolution of sympathy\nintroduced in congress. He called at\ntention to the fact that all the resolu\ntions of sympathy for the Boers, intro\nduced by himself and others, still lay\nin the committee rooms.\' Ilje spoke as\nfollows:\n"For that reason," said he, "I desire\nat this time to express and to place on\nrecord my abhorrence and condemna\ntion of the unjust, the inhuman, the\npredatory, the cruel and barbarous war\nthe empire of Great Britain is relent\nlessly waging in South Africa to des\ntroy and exterminate two brave little\nrepublics sisters of our own and as\nfree and independent. As an American\ncitizen and member of congress I am\nnot ashamed to have it known that my\nsympathy is now, always has been and\nalways will be with the Boers in the\nmagnificent effort to maintain their\nfreedom their independence against\nthe piracy of the corrupt oligarchy\nnow controling the policy of the Brit\nish empire.\n"A republic that hasunk so low that\nit glories in the downfall of a sister re\npublic is in danger of destruction it\nself. A republic that refuses sympathy\nto a sister republic struggling to main\ntain its independence against a mon\narchical aggression is unworthy of the\nname and is in danger of monarchy it\nself. A republic that will secretly help\na monarchy to destroy a republic and\nblot out its free institutions is a re\npublic rotten to the core and will soon\nfall like a decayed tree on the bank of\na turbulent stream, to be swept away\nforever.\n"In my opinion, the defeat of the\nBoers will be the severest blow to re\npublican institutions that has been\nstruck in more than a century and\nevery friend of liberty the world over\nshonld pray that Oom Paul may be\nsuccessful.\n"The administration will do nothing\nfor the Boers and seems to be secretly\nin sympathy with Great Britain and\nrendering it all the aid it can. Every\nliberty-loving citizen of the republic\nshould denounce and condemn these\npro-English tendencies of the White\nhouse. This republic should stand by\nrepublics, not against them. God bk-ss\nthe embattled farmers of South Africa\nis my fervent prayer, and from the\nashes of the conflict mar there arise a\ngreater and grander republic, the glor\nious United States of South Africa."\nHis Indignation at Iielnff Spied Upon by\nIlls Keeper Ills Individual CoarR\nUndaunted by IIrd fate.\nOne of the "Talks With Napoleon"\nquoted from Dr. O\'Meara\'s diary in The\nCentury records Napoleon\'s indigna\ntion at being, as he considered it, spied\nupon while living at St. Helena.\n"1 understand," said he, "that an offl\ner is placed here to report about me\nand to see me two or three times in the\n21 hours, and" that they are talking of\nmaking him go into my chamber to see\nme if I did not come out.
