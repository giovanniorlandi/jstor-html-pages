Marks, Maxim L. Lamare, and Martin D. King\nDepartment of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London, Egham, Surrey, TW20 0EX, UK\nCorrespondence: Martin D. King (m.king@rhul.ac.uk)\nReceived: 25 April 2017 – Discussion started: 16 May 2017\nRevised: 7 October 2017 – Accepted: 12 October 2017 – Published: 12 December 2017\nAbstract. Radiative-transfer calculations of the light reflectivity\nand extinction coefficient in laboratory-generated sea\nice doped with and without black carbon demonstrate that\nthe radiative-transfer model TUV-snow can be used to predict\nthe light reflectance and extinction coefficient as a func-\ntion of wavelength. The sea ice is representative of first-year\nsea ice containing typical amounts of black carbon and other\nlight-absorbing impurities. The experiments give confidence\nin the application of the model to predict albedo of other sea\nice fabrics.\nSea ices, ∼ 30 cm thick, were generated in the Royal Holloway\nSea Ice Simulator (∼ 2000 L tanks) with scattering\ncross sections measured between 0.012 and 0.032 m2 kg−1\nfor four ices. Sea ices were generated with and without\n∼ 5 cm upper layers containing particulate black carbon.\nNadir reflectances between 0.60 and 0.78 were measured\nalong with extinction coefficients of 0.1 to 0.03 cm−1 (efolding\ndepths of 10–30 cm) at a wavelength of 500 nm. Val-\nues were measured between light wavelengths of 350 and\n650 nm. The sea ices generated in the Royal Holloway Sea\nIce Simulator were found to be representative of natural sea\nices.\nParticulate black carbon at mass ratios of ∼ 75, ∼ 150 and\n∼ 300ngg−1 in a 5 cm ice layer lowers the albedo to 97, 90\nand 79 % of the reflectivity of an undoped “clean” sea ice (at\na wavelength of 500 nm).\n1 Introduction\nRapid decline of sea ice in the Arctic is often seen as a bellwether\nfor modern day climate change (e.g. IPCC, 2013).\nModel predictions of future sea ice extent have a large degree\nof uncertainty (e.g. IPCC, 2013). Accurate representa-\ntion and re-creation of the optical and physical properties of\nsea ice is essential to develop accurate models of sea ice. The\nRoyal Holloway (RHUL) Sea Ice Simulator facility aims to\ncreate a realistic sea ice within a controlled environment with\nthe ability to monitor both the physical (temperature, salinity\nand density) and optical (nadir reflectivity and extinction coefficient)\nproperties of the sea ice – the results of which can\nbe used to evaluate sea ice models.\nThe following study presents the first data from the\nRHUL sea ice simulator used to validate the Tropospheric\nUltraviolet–Visible (TUV)-snow radiative-transfer model for\nuse with sea ice. The TUV-snow model is a coupled\natmosphere–snow radiative-transfer model, described in detail\nby Lee-Taylor and Madronich (2002). The model has\nbeen used multiple times for investigations of radiative transfer\nin snow (e.g. King et al., 2005; France et al., 2011, 2012;\nReay et al., 2012) and has also been adapted for use with\nsea ice (e.g. King et al., 2005; Marks and King, 2013, 2014;\nLamare et al., 2016). The model has previously been experimentally\nvalidated for photochemistry in snow by Phillips\nand Simpson (2005), but it has not been experimentally validated\nfor sea ice.\nThe TUV-snow model will first be evaluated by comparing\nmeasured optical properties (reflectance and extinction\ncoefficient) of sea ice grown in a laboratory to TUV-snow\nmodel radiative-transfer calculations for a sea ice with the\nsame properties. Second, the model will be evaluated by\ncomparing measured nadir reflectance with light-absorbing\nimpurities in the laboratory sea ice to radiative-transfer calculations\nwith the same light-absorbing impurities in the sea\nice, namely black carbon and algae.\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n', '2868 A. A. Marks et al.: Optical properties of BC-doped, laboratory-grown sea ice\nSea ice typically contains impurities such as black carbon,\nsediment and algae (e.g. Perovich, 1996). Black carbon is\nan efficient absorber of solar radiation (e.g. Mitchell, 1957;\nHighwood and Kinnersley, 2006; Hansen and Nazarenko,\n2004; Jacobson, 2001; Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2008;\nBond et al., 2013) and its deposition onto, or incorporation\ninto, sea ice has been shown through modelling calculations\nto decrease the surface reflectance of the sea ice, increasing\nmelt rates (e.g. Grenfell et al., 2002; Jacobson, 2004; Light\net al., 1998; Ledley and Thompson, 1986; Goldenson et al.,\n2012; Holland et al., 2012; Marks and King, 2013, 2014).\nTo evaluate the TUV-snow model with black carbon, a commercial\nblack carbon is added to a 5 cm surface layer of\n30–50 cm thick sea ice created in the laboratory in mass ratios\nof 0, 75, 150 and 300 ngg−1 and the nadir reflectance\nof sea ice measured. The experimental reflectivity is compared\nto a calculated reflectivity using the TUV-snow model,\nfor the same black carbon mass ratios. The work presented\nhere will demonstrate that radiative-transfer modelling with\nTUV-snow model (Lee-Taylor and Madronich, 2002) can reproduce\nlaboratory-grown ices with differing fabrics with a\nrange of mass ratios of light-absorbing impurities. Such a\nvalidation will give confidence to others in the calculations of\nTUV-snow for other sea ice types and other light-absorbing\nimpurities.\nPrevious research on the effects of black carbon on sea ice\noptical properties have used radiative-transfer calculations\nand global climate model simulations. To the authors’ knowledge\nthere are no laboratory or field studies examining the ef-\nfects of added black carbon on reducing sea ice reflectance.\nA related study by Hadley and Kirchstetter (2012) carried\nout successful laboratory experiments on artificial snow, investigating\nthe effects of black carbon on snow reflectance.\nThe results from Hadley and Kirchstetter (2012) were used\nto validate the Snow, Ice and Aerosol radiation (SNICAR)\nmodel (Flanner et al., 2007) used in the 2013 IPCC report\n(IPCC, 2013). Similarly, Brandt et al. (2011) investigated the\neffect of black carbon on albedo of artificial snowpacks using\nsnowmaking machines, showing a good match between measured\nvalues and albedos calculated from radiative-transfer\nmodelling. Peltoniemi et al. (2015) measured the effect on\nsnow bidirectional reflectance owing to additions of chimney\nsoot, volcanic sand and glaciogenic silt, demonstrating how\nsnow metamorphism caused by the addition of these particles\nsubsequently impacted on the albedo.\nThe study presented here includes the first experiments\nwith the Royal Holloway Sea Ice Simulator, the first experiments\nto evaluate the TUV-snow radiative-transfer model for\ncalculations of extinction coefficient and reflectivity of undoped\nsea ice, the first experimental results to demonstrate\nthe change in reflectance owing to light-absorbing impurities\nin sea ice and finally the first experiments to evaluate the accuracy\nof the TUV-snow model for reflectivity calculations\nfor light-absorbing impurities in sea ice.\nThroughout the paper the term “experimental” refers to\nexperiments with laboratory-grown sea ice using the sea ice\nsimulator described in Sect. 2.1, with results being referred\nto as “measured” values. The term “modelled” refers to calculations\nfrom the TUV-snow radiative-transfer model, the\nresults of which are referred to as “calculated” values.\n2 Experimental method\nThe following sections will describe the design of the sea ice\nsimulator (Sect. 2.1), the characterization of both the optical\nand physical properties of the laboratory ice (Sect. 2.2)\nand the creation of sea ice doped with black carbon particles\n(Sect. 2.3).\n2.1 Sea ice simulator design\nThe sea ice simulator is designed to replicate a Polar sea ice\ngrowth environment under UV and visible wavelengths of\nsolar radiation. Previous experiments with sea ice simulators\nhave been carried out by, for example, Light et al. (2015),\nBuist et al. (2011), Papadimitriou et al. (2003), Haas et al.\n(1999), Polach et al. (2013), Hare et al. (2013) and Grenfell\nand Perovich (1981). The setup of the simulator is shown\nin Fig. 1. The simulator is housed in a refrigerated shipping\ncontainer (11.95 m length× 2.56 m height× 2.29 m width),\nwhich can be temperature controlled from −25 to 25 ◦C.\nThe air temperature within the container varies by ±1 ◦C\n– although thermocouples monitoring temperature at the ice\nsurface show better temperature stability, and the temperature\nvariation measured within the ice is less than the preci-\nsion of the probes (±0.2 ◦C). Every 12 h the chiller removes\nice build-up on the cooling plant and air temperature rises\nbriefly by ∼ 6 ◦C. Inside the container, sea ice is formed in\na 2000 L polyethylene cylindrical white plastic tank (1.32 m\nheight× 1.39 m diameter) placed on insulated pallets. Following\nthe approach of Perovich and Grenfell (1981), a cylin-\ndrical design is utilized for the tank to help avoid mechanical\nstress at particular locations. A 1 cm insulating layer of black\nneoprene also surrounds the tank sides. A metal Unistrut\nframe surrounds the tank to further improve structural integrity.\nBlack wooden boards, painted with mould resistant\npaint, are fixed around the Unistrut structure with 3 cm thick\npolystyrene insulation fitting between the wooden boards and\nthe tank.\nThe tank is filled with a solution of Tropic Marin (Atkinson\nand Bingman, 1997) giving water with a salinity of\n32 PSU, representing Arctic Ocean salinity (Boyer et al.,\n2013). Tropic Marin is a synthetic sea salt mixture for aquaculture\ncontaining over 70 chemical elements in typical nat-\nural concentrations representative of the ocean with the notable\nexception of nitrate and phosphate, to inhibit algae\ngrowth. Atkinson and Bingman (1997) show that the concentrations\nof major cations and anions of Tropic Marin are\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2867–2881, 2017 www.the-cryosphere.net/11/2867/2017/\n', 'A. A.

A closed pipe runs around the base of the tank connected to a heater\nunit circulating a water and glycol mixture gently warming the base of the tank. Water is circulated around the tank by a pump in an insulated\ncontainer and also passed through a UV sterilizer and particulate filter. Note that the diffusing hood and insulation have been stripped away\nfor clarity in the photo.\nwithin 10 % of seawater. Previous sea ice simulators use either\nsodium chloride or synthetic sea salt mixtures similar to\nTropic Marin (e.g. Krembs et al., 2001; Mock et al., 2002;\nPapadimitriou et al., 2003; Hare et al., 2013).\nTo create circulation within the tank, ensuring temperature\nand salinity stratification does not occur, an Iwaki MD-\n10 pump circulates water at ∼ 10 Lmin−1 at the base of the\ntank, as shown in Fig. 1. The circulated water is also pumped\nthrough a 10 µm filter to remove any particulate impurities\nand a UV sterilizer to prevent algae growth.\nSea ice grows from surface cooling of a salt water body\n(Weeks, 2010). To ensure even and realistic ice growth in\nthe tank (from the surface, downwards) a closed pipe is run\naround the bottom of the tank, connected to a heater unit.\nThe heater unit contains a solution of water and pure ethylene\nglycol (in a 1 : 1 ratio), which is pumped around the pipe at a\nconstant temperature (0 ◦C), to warm the base of the tank and\nprevent freezing. Figure 2 demonstrates that the temperature\nof the water beneath the sea ice is not thermally stratified;\nice temperature decreases linearly through the ice with depth\nand the ice surface temperature is at a constant −15 ◦C.\nIllumination, during optical measurements only, and replicating\nshortwave solar wavelengths over 350–650 nm, is pro-\nvided with a set of 20 Daystar daylight simulation fluorescent\ntubes and five sun-bed ultraviolet tube lights (peak illumination\nwavelength ∼ 350, 40 nm FWHM). Measurement of re-\nflectance of the sea ice is a relative measurement, (i.e. the\nquotient of reflected radiance of sea ice to reflected radiance\nfrom a reflectance standard); thus, the intensity spec-\ntrum of the lamp does not have to match the solar spectrum.\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nD\nep\nth\n/c\nm\n-20-15-10-505\nTemperature/ºC\n Day 0\n Day 0.5\n Day 1\n Day 2\n Day 3\n Day 4\n Day 6\n Day 7\n Day 9\n Day 11\n Day 14\n Day 17\nFigure 2.

Reflectance of sea ice during ice growth and the day-today\nreflectance stability of the potentially optically thick ice (day 10\nonwards).\nThe lights are evenly distributed directly above the tank to\nprovide a diffuse illumination source. The light is further\ndiffused by opaque white boards placed around the edges\nof the tank. Diffuse lighting was used to simplify the measurement\nof extinction coefficient and provide a useful re-\nflectance product. The radiance, as a function of azimuth and\nzenith angle, within the experiment was checked with a fibre\noptic probe and a broadband visible wavelength mea-\nsurement and was found to vary by 5–10 %. The short term\nvariability of the lamps was less than 0.1 % (after an initial\nwarm-up) on the timescale of the measurement of reflectivity\nor e-folding depth. Note that both the value of nadir re-\nflectance (relative to a Spectralon panel) and light penetration\ndepth are not dependent on the illumination irradiance,\nproviding the irradiance does not change during the measurement.\nFigure 3 shows the change in ice nadir reflectance dur-\ning ice growth and the day-to-day reflectance stability of the\noptically thick ice.\n2.2 Creation and characterization of sea ice\nTo create sea ice, an air temperature inside the container\nof ∼−15 ◦C is maintained. Cold air is circulated within\nthe container with fans. An additional air fan, attached to\nthe ceiling, blows cold, ambient air at the water surface\n(110 m3 min−1), increasing the heat flux from the ice surface,\nquickening ice formation and assisting the production\nof columnar ice (Weeks, 2010).\nSea ice is grown in the simulator for ∼17 days, producing\nice with a thickness of ∼ 30 cm. Temperature–depth profiles\nand nadir reflectance of the ice were measured daily during\ngrowth (described in Sect. 2.2.1 and 2.2.3 respectively). The\nextinction coefficient is measured at the end of the experiment\nas it destroys the homogeneity of the ice (described in\nSect. 2.2.4).\nCharacterization of sea ice physical properties\n2.2.1 Temperature profiles\nTemperature profiles through the sea ice are recorded daily\nduring ice growth to give an indication of sea ice thickness\nand ensure that temperature stratification does not\noccur within the underlying seawater. The temperature is\nrecorded via a series of thermocouples, as used by Rabus and\nEchelmeyer (2002), Johnston and Timco (2002) and Nomurai\net al. (2006). Calibrated type T thermocouples are each\ninserted into a thin plastic sleeve and then a white polypropylene\npole at regular depths (every 2 cm) into the water, and\nthen frozen in place during ice formation. The precision of\nall the thermocouples at −15 ◦C was measured as ±0.2 ◦C.\nTemperature of sea ice decreases from the surface to the base;\nice thickness can be determined from the point where the\ntemperature becomes constant with depth – which can be assumed\nto be seawater, as shown in Fig. 2.\n2.2.2 Determining sea ice properties by ice coring\nCores of the ice are taken to determine sea ice properties at\nthe conclusion of the optical experiments (Sect. 2.2). The\ncorer design was based on a CRREL report by Rand and\nMellor (1985). Cores are photographed, divided into ∼ 5 cm\nsections and their dimensions and mass measured to derive\ndensity. Salinity is measured after melting using a Fisher Scientific\nseawater refractometer (cross-calibrated with an accu-\nrate ion conduction probe).\nCharacterization of sea ice optical properties\n2.2.3 Measuring reflectance\nThe nadir reflectance of the sea ice was measured daily during\nice growth until the value became constant (taking be-\ntween 6 and 12 days). Reflectance becomes constant once\na sufficient ice thickness is reached such that the increasing\nice thickness does not change the measured reflectivity. Upwelling\nradiance from the ice is measured via an optical lens\nconnected to a 400 µm XSR fibre optic coupled to an Ocean\nOptics USB 2000+ spectrometer (wavelength range: 200–\n850 nm; resolution: 1.5 nm FWHM; signal : noise 250 : 1).\nThe optical lens is situated ∼ 40 cm above the sea ice surface\nat nadir with a view footprint covering a circular area\n∼ 315 cm2. The footprint is an order of magnitude larger than\nany surface feature on the sea ice.\nTo convert ice surface radiance measurements to reflectance,\nthe radiance of light from the sea ice surface mea-\nsured at nadir is ratioed to the radiance from a reference LamThe\nCryosphere, 11, 2867–2881, 2017 www.the-cryosphere.net/11/2867/2017/\n', 'A. A. Marks et al.: Optical properties of BC-doped, laboratory-grown sea ice 2871\nbertian reflector at nadir (a Spectralon panel) measured in the\nsame location but raised 5 mm above the ice surface and under\nidentical illumination as the sea ice.\nDuring a reflectivity measurement a 30 cm× 30 cm Spectralon\npanel is added to the diffuse lighting environment\nabove the sea ice. The addition of this panel increases the\nradiance, L, within the diffuse lighting environment. A very\nconservative estimate of the effect on the measurement of\nthe reflectivity can be calculated by analogy to an integrating\nsphere. The Spectralon panel represents 0.66 % of\nthe area of the diffuse lighting environment, which is approximately\na cube made up of white panels and sea ice\n(i.e. 6 m× 1.5 m× 1.5 m = 13.5 m2). Treating the diffuse\nlighting environment above the sea ice as a crude integrating\nsphere and considering fractional change in radiance, δL\nL\n, after\nBall et al. (2013), who suggest δL\nL\n≈\nApanel\nAenvironmentρ\n, where\nApanel is the area of the Spectralon panel, Aenvironment is the\narea of the diffusing “cube” and ρ is the overall reflectivity\nof the diffusing cube. A very crude analysis assumes that\nreflectivity of the panel is 1 and the part fraction of the hypothetical\nintegrating sphere is 0. In the limit of a reflective\nenvironment, δL\nL\n→\nApanel\nAenvironmentρ\n∼ 0.67%. Thus the overestimation\nof the radiance (∼ 0.67 %) is significantly less than\nthe uncertainty displayed on the measurement of nadir reflectivity\ndisplayed in Figs. 3 and 7.\n2.2.4 Measuring extinction coefficient\nAt the completion of the experiment the extinction coefficient\nand e-folding depth are measured. The e-folding depth is the\ndistance over which light intensity reduces to 1\ne\nof its initial\nvalue and is the reciprocal of the extinction coefficient. The\ne-folding depth is reported in addition to the extinction coefficient.\nThe sea ice e-folding depth and extinction coefficient\nis measured by drilling a single hole gradually through the ice\nin∼ 5 cm increments with a sharp drill. At each depth drilled\nthe same fibre optic is inserted into the hole and the light intensity\n(upwelling radiance) is measured via an Ocean Optics\nspectrometer. In an optically thick sea ice the measurement\nof either up or downwelling light for e-folding depth is not\nimportant, as has been shown by France and King (2012).\nThe hole is a tight fit around the fibre, but a thin, light diffusing\ndisc of white PTFE is also placed around the fibre at\nthe ice surface, to minimize any stray light entering the hole\nwithout altering the light field near the hole.\nSimultaneously to the light intensity in the hole being measured\n(Iraw), the light intensity of another fibre optic inside\na diffusing PTFE container at the ice surface was measured\n(Iref), to account for any change in the intensity of the fluorescent\nlights. The relative light intensity at depth z, namely\nIz, is then calculated:\nIz =\nIraw(z)\nIref\n. (1)\nThe e-folding depth, \x0f, is calculated using Eq. (2), where Iz\nis the relative intensity at a depth z, and Iz′ is intensity at the\nshallowest depth, z′. From the measured light intensity the\ne-folding depth is calculated by fitting an exponential curve\nthrough Iz versus z data:\nIz\nIz′\n= e\n−\n(\n(z−z′)\n\x0f\n)\n. (2)\nThe extinction coefficient, k, is than calculated as the reciprocal\nof the e-folding depth.\nMeasurements used to calculate the e-folding depth are\nonly conducted in the middle of the ice as the irradiance profile\nchanges rapidly at the air–ice and ice–water boundary (a\ngood example is shown in King et al., 2005). The calculation\nof an e-folding depth from the modelled downwelling irradiance\nwas calculated from similar depths as the experimental\nice. The modelled ice had the same thickness and underlying\ntank radiance field as the experiment. The extinction coefficient\nand e-folding depth measured in the work presented\nhere are asymptotic (reaching a constant value as shown in\nKing et al., 2005) as the light field to the sea ice is diffuse\nand thus there are no near-surface effects as found frequently\nin fieldwork (e.g. Reay et al., 2012, and references therein).\n2.3 Creation of black-carbon-doped sea ice\nOnce the sea ice has grown to ∼ 30 cm thick (∼ 3 weeks of\nice growth) 75 L (equivalent to a∼ 5 cm layer) of chilled seawater\ndoped with a known concentration of black carbon (de-\nscribed in Sect. 2.3.1) is added to the surface and frozen in\nplace forming a 5 cm black carbon bearing ice layer. Black\ncarbon is placed within a 5 cm surface layer of the artificial\nice to replicate black carbon entrainment into sea ice following\nmelting of overlying snow as described by Grenfell et al.\n(2002) and Doherty et al. (2010). The new 5 cm layer of black\ncarbon bearing seawater is left to freeze for 3 days and the reflectivity\nof the new sea ice surface then measured daily over\na week. The sea ice is then cored and density and salinity\nmeasured down the core to record the physical ice structure\nbefore and after the black carbon bearing layer is added.\nAt completion of the experiment the ice is melted and water\nis purified by filtration through a 1 µm Purtex filter to re-\nmove black carbon particulates. If any black carbon particulates\nwere to remain the concentration would be negligible,\nas it would be diluted by 2000 L of sea water (a dilution factor\nof ∼ 30). The whole process is repeated with other black\ncarbon concentrations in the 5 cm layer, giving a total of four\nmass loadings:∼ 75,∼ 150 and∼ 300 ngg−1 and a blank run\nwith 0 ngg−1 of black carbon. The sea ice was melted and\nthe resulting seawater was treated with aqueous hypochlorous\nacid (HOCl) and filtered between experimental runs to\nremove any algae that may have grown. No algae were visible\nto the naked eye.\nwww.the-cryosphere.net/11/2867/2017/ The Cryosphere, 11, 2867–2881, 2017\n', '2872 A. A. Marks et al.: Optical properties of BC-doped, laboratory-grown sea ice\n2.3.1 Creating atmospherically representative\nblack carbon\nTo create the aqueous black carbon solutions a method\nfrom Clarke (1982) is adapted. The black carbon used,\nMonarch 120, is produced by Cabot Corporation to replace\nthe discontinued Monarch 71 used by Grenfell et al. (2011).\nApproximately 1 g of the black carbon is added to a solution\nof 800 mL of pure water and 200 mL isopropanol (iso-\npropanol aids dispersal of the black carbon in the concentrated\nsolution) (Clarke, 1982). The solution is then placed\nin an ultrasonic bath for 2 h to ensure that the black carbon\nis fully dispersed and to break up conglomerated lumps.\nThe solution is then suction filtered through 2 µm Nuclepore\nmembrane filters followed by 0.8 µm Nuclepore filter to remove\nlarger particles and ensure the final solution is repre-\nsentative of atmospheric black carbon, i.e. particle diameter\n< 0.8 µm (Clarke, 1982). The mass loading of black carbon\nin the solution is determined gravimetrically (i.e. by evaporating\nand weighing a portion of the black carbon solution).\nTwo black carbon solutions were used, with mass loadings of\n46± 11 and 11± 1.5 µgg−1. The uncertainties are the standard\ndeviation of three repeated gravimetric determinations.\nKnown amounts of solutions 1 and 2 are mixed with 75 L\nof artificial seawater to give overall black carbon mass ratios\ndetailed in Table 1. The mass ratios of black carbon are\napproximately 0, 75, 150 and 300 ngg−1; these approximate\nvalues will be subsequently used in the text, whilst precise\nvalues are reported in Table 1.\n2.3.2 Characterization of black carbon optical\nproperties\nThe mass absorption cross section of the black carbon used in\nthe present study is estimated using an integrating sandwich\nspectrometer, described by Grenfell et al. (2011), based on\nClarke (1982). The integrating sandwich spectrometer measures\nthe absorption spectrum of particulate matter on filter\nsamples in a diffuse radiance environment. Absorption spectra\nof multiple filters containing black carbon loadings are\nconverted to a mass absorption cross section. A mass absorption\ncross section of 2.1 m2 g−1 (λ= 610 nm) is estimated for\nthe black carbon placed in the artificial sea ice.

Uncertainty is not provided for the density of the top layer as this is the\naverage of only two measurements, although the uncertainty is likely to be similar to that of the lower layer. The mass ratio of black carbon\nadded to the surface layer is also shown.

Therefore, the\nmass absorption cross section of the black carbon is expressed\nas\nσBC = σρl\nαρl\nβbc\n, (4)\nwhere αρl is the slope of the linear regression between the\nmass loading of the polypropylene calibration sheets and the\nrelative absorbance of the polypropylene measured in the integrating\nsandwich spectrometer, βbc is the slope of the linear\nregression between the mass loading of the black carbon filters\nand the relative absorbance of the black carbon measured\nin the integrating sandwich spectrometer and σρl is the mass\nabsorption cross section of the polypropylene, given by the\nBeer–Lambert law.\nThe mass absorption coefficients of the polypropylene\nsheets are measured with a standard spectrometer using the\nBeer–Lambert law. The measured mass absorption coefficient\nis 229.23± 0.02 cm2 g−1 (λ= 610 nm).\nTo visually investigate the size and shape of the black\ncarbon particles used in the experiment, scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) is employed. Approximately 6 mm wide\nsquares of the 0.4 µm filters containing black carbon particles\nwere cut and glued on standard 12.7 mm diameter SEM\nstubs using double-faced carbon tabs. The samples were gold\ncoated using a Polaron E5100 Series II Cool Sputter Coater\nfor 3 min in air, creating a 45 nm thick coating. SEM images\nwere generated on a Hitachi S3000N scanning electron microscope.\nThe images were obtained at a magnification of\n×4000 at a working distance of 12.5 mm, with an acceleration\nenergy of 20 kV and a beam current of 85 000 nA. Fig-\nure 5 shows a SEM image of black carbon particles on a\n0.4 µm Nuclepore filter. The SEM images are analysed using\nthe ImageJ image analysis software (Abramoff et al., 2004),\nto determine the size distribution and the circularity of the\nblack carbon particles. The circularity of the particles is determined\nby the shape factor (Heilbronner and Barrett, 2013),\ncalculated using\nSF=\n4πA\nP 2\n, (5)\nwhere A is the area of the shape and P the perimeter of\nthe shape. The shape factor represents the deviation of the\nperimeter of a particle from a circle of the same area. Values\nof the shape factor vary between 0, representing an elon-\ngated shape, and 1, describing a circle. The average shape\nfactor of the particles shown in Fig. 5 is 0.842, indicating\na rough spherical shape. Assuming a spherical nature of the\nparticles, the diameter is calculated as the maximum Feret diameter.\nThe average diameter of the particles shown in Fig. 5\nis 0.461± 0.331 (2σ ) µm.\nThe mass absorption coefficients of the black carbon is\nalso estimated by a Mie light scattering calculation using the\nSEM data. Mie calculations are performed using size data\nfrom the SEM to provide a check of the value for black carbon\nabsorption cross section for the radiative-transfer calcu-\nlations. For the Mie calculations the black carbon diameter\nof 0.461 µm is used with a density of 1.8 gcm−3 and a commonly\nused refractive index of 1.8–0.5i (Clarke and Noone,\n1985), giving an absorption cross section at a wavelength of\n550 nm of 2.78 m2 g−1.\nIn the work presented here an absorption cross section\nvalue of 2.5 m2 g−1 will be used for radiative-transfer calculations,\nas this is between the value from the Mie calculations\nand that from the integrating sandwich spectrometer.\n3 TUV-snow radiative-transfer calculations\nCalculations using the TUV-snow radiative-transfer model\n(described in Sect. 3.1) are undertaken to simulate the optical\nand physical properties measured of the sea ice.

The model parameterizes sea\nice optical properties using only an asymmetry factor, g,\na wavelength-independent scattering cross section, σscatt, a\nwavelength-dependant absorption cross section, σ+abs, and sea\nice density and thickness.\n3.2 Calculations of undoped ice reflectance and\nextinction coefficient/e-folding depth\nThe reflectance and extinction coefficient/e-folding depth of\nthe undoped sea ice are calculated through radiative-transfer\ncalculations using the TUV-snow model with derived scattering\nand absorption cross sections for the ice. To derive\nthese values, values of scattering and absorption cross section\nare varied until they reproduce the experimentally mea-\nsured reflectivity and e-folding depth data for the sea ice as\ndetailed in King et al. (2005), France et al. (2011, 2012) and\nMarks and King (2014). Ice density and thickness are measured\nfrom ice cored at the end of an experiment. The density\nof the ice is detailed in Table 1. The ice is modelled with a\n30 cm thick bottom layer subdivided into 45 sub-layers with\neach sub-layer representing 1 cm apart from the bottom and\ntop five sub-layers which are 1 mm thick. The asymmetry\nfactor for the ice is fixed at 0.95, based on a value suggested\nby Mobley et al. (1998) for a bubble-rich ice, which is observed\nin ice cores taken from the tank.\nAll calculations are undertaken between wavelengths\n350 and 650 nm, using eight-streams in DISORT. The\nwavelength-dependant nadir reflectance of the water-filled\ntank is measured and included in the model as the underice\nreflectance; the measurements are included in the Sup-\nplement. The model illuminates the ice with diffuse light.\nReflectivity is calculated as the ratio of upwelling, Irrup,\nto downwelling Irrdown, irradiance at the surface of the sea\nice,\n(\nIrrup\nIrrdown\n)\n. The e-folding depth is calculated using Eq. (2),\nand the irradiances are calculated at depths of 5, 10, 15 and\n20 cm in the sea ice with reference irradiance at a depth of\n5 cm (to reproduce experimentally derived e-folding depths).\nThe extinction coefficient is calculated as the reciprocal of\nthe e-folding depth.\n3.3 Calculating surface reflectance of ice with a\nblack-carbon-doped layer\nThe radiative-transfer modelling was repeated for the blackcarbon-doped\nsea ices. For these radiative-transfer calcula-\ntions, parameters are kept the same as the undoped ice calculations,\nalthough the ice is modelled as two layers; a 30 cm\nthick undoped bottom layer and a 5 cm upper, black carbon\nbearing, layer. These principal layers are subdivided into\n45 sub-layers for the bottom layer and 14 sub-layers in the\ntop layer, with each sub-layer being 1 cm thick, apart from\n0.5 cm either side of a boundary (air–ice, undoped ice–doped\nice and ice–water), where sub-layers are 1 mm.\nThe absorption cross section of the top layer was the same\nas the bottom undoped layer plus additional absorption for\nany black carbon present (0, 75, 150 and 300 ngg−1), where\nthe absorption cross section of the black carbon is 2.5 m2 g−1\n(see Sect. 2.3.2). The scattering cross section of the top layer\nwas derived by a trial and error method to obtain the best\nfit (judged by eye) between modelled and measured values\nof reflectance and e-folding depth as described in Sect. 4.3.\nDensities of the top layers are shown in Table 1.\n4 Results\n4.1 Physical properties of sea ice and growth rates\nSalinity, density and temperature–depth profiles of all ice\ncores are given in the Supplement. A typical salinity and temperature\nprofile is given in Fig. 6. The average density for the\ntop and bottom layer for each black carbon loading is shown\nin Table 1.\nIce growth rates were similar for all runs with the ice growing\nat approximately 1.8 cm per day. For all runs the growth\nrate gradually declined as ice growth progressed. The time\ntaken for reflectance of the ice to become a constant value became\nlonger, taking 5 days for run 1, 7 days for run 2, 11 days\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2867–2881, 2017 www.the-cryosphere.net/11/2867/2017/\n', 'A.

Each run represents an experiment\nwith new sea ice growth before the black carbon\nbearing layer is added. The reflectance is wavelength dependent,\npeaking at values around 500 nm, as would be expected\nfor sea ice (e.g. Grenfell and Maykut, 1977). Measurements\nof reflectance shown in Fig. 7 are the average of 5 days of\nreflectance measurements taken when ice reflectance had become\nconstant. The reflectance of the undoped sea ice de-\ncreases from run 1 to run 4, which is attributable to the\nslightly different ice fabrics in each run and the fact that the\nice thickness is not optically thick.\nThe extinction coefficient and e-folding depth of the undoped\nice, Fig. 8, are also wavelength dependent, with the\nlargest values of e-folding depth observed around 550 nm for\nall runs, again representing a natural sea ice (e.g. Grenfell\nand Maykut, 1977). The e-folding depths increase with run\nnumber, which is again attributable to the different ice fab1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\nN\nad\nir \nre\nfle\nct\nan\nce\n o\nf c\nle\nan\n ic\ne\n650600550500450400350\nWavelength/nm\nReflectance of clean ice\nRun 1  Measured  Modelled\nRun 2  Measured  Modelled\nRun 3  Measured  Modelled\nRun 4  Measured  Modelled\nFigure 7.

The increased e-folding depth can be attributed\nto a less light scattering sea ice matrix.\nFigures 7 and 8 also contain the modelled reflectivity and\nextinction coefficient/e-folding depth fitted to the experimental\ndata. With the exception of the UV nadir reflectivity of\nruns 3 and 4, the modelled fits are well within uncertainty of\nthe measurement.\nIt should be noted that it is more difficult to find a pair of\nvalues for scattering and absorption cross sections (σscatt and\nσ+abs) for each wavelength that produce a good reproduction\nof the experimental reflectivity and e-folding depth, rather\nthan reflectivity alone, as the system described here is significantly\nmore constrained in the number of degrees of free-\ndom. Thus, measuring reflectivity and e-folding depth gives\nthe reader more confidence in the values of σscatt and σ+abs.\n4.2.2 Derived absorption and scattering cross sections\nfrom experimental data for undoped ice\nThe calculated values of the absorption cross section of impurities\nin the undoped ice used in the radiative-transfer cal-\nculations are shown in Fig. 9. The shape of the derived absorption\ncross section for each run is similar, decreasing\nslightly with increased run number. Ideally, the absorption\nshould be zero for undoped ice (no impurities). Absorption\ncross sections of Saharan dust from Lamare et al. (2016) and\nchlorophyll in algae from Bricaud et al. (2004) and Mundy\net al.

These values of the scattering cross section are\nshown in Fig. 10, varying from 0.05 to 0.35 m2 kg−1. The\nfit between the measured and calculated reflectance is well\nwithin uncertainty limits for all runs, demonstrating that the\nTUV-snow model can reproduce experimental reflectance for\nsea ice doped with black carbon, even with varying fabrics of\nsea ice.\n5 Discussion\nIn the discussion section possible sources of uncertainty in\nthe experimental measurements compared to the calculated\nvalues will be discussed as well as the realism of the laboratory\nsea ice and potential limitations of the sea ice simulator.\n5.1 Sources of uncertainty in the experimental\nmeasurements compared to the calculated values\nThe comparison between experimentally measured and calculated\nvalues reported here are presented under the assump-\ntion that the experimental conditions are accurately replicated\nby the TUV-snow radiative-transfer model. Potential\nsources for uncertainty in comparing experimentally measured\nvalues to calculated values include: aggregation of\nblack carbon particles; mobilization of black carbon from the\ntop layer of sea ice into the underlying ice and sea water;\nthe value of the asymmetry parameter used in the radiativetransfer\nmodelling; uncertainty in the derived scattering and\nabsorption cross sections of the experimental sea ice; and uncertainty\nin the mass ratio of black carbon added to the lab-\noratory sea ice. The possible contribution of each of these\nfactors is subsequently reviewed.\n5.1.1 Aggregation of particles\nThe effect of aggregation of black carbon particles decreases\nthe absorption cross section in two ways. Assuming that two\nblack carbon particles aggregate to form a new spherical\nblack carbon particle, the newly formed particle would have\ntwice the volume and the radius would be a factor of 3\n√\n2\nlarger. Mie calculations show that the absorption cross section\nwould decrease and the mass-absorption cross section\nwould decrease and flatten according to Dang et al. (2015).\nSecondly, aggregation would reduce the number density of\nblack carbon particles, further reducing the absorption of\nlight within the ice. However, the good agreement shown\nbetween measured and calculated reflectance for the blackcarbon-doped\nice suggests that aggregation is not occurring\nwithin the ice.\n5.1.2 Black carbon mobilization\nThe radiative-transfer model assumes that the black carbon\nis distributed evenly within the black-carbon-doped layer.\nHowever, the experimental ice may not have had an even\ndistribution. Sea ice forms brine pockets and brine channels\non freezing (e.g. Weeks, 2010). As the extra layer of seawater\nfreezes, brine will drain downwards into the layer of ice\nbelow and also be expelled onto the surface. Eicken (2003)\nsuggest that impurities in seawater are trapped in the brine\ninclusions as sea ice grows. If black carbon is situated in\nbrine inclusions, then some of it may drain into the underlying\nlayer of sea ice and eventually into the underlying sea-\nwater, as described by Eicken (2003). Doherty et al. (2010),\nwho measured black carbon mass ratios in sea ice in the Arctic,\nshowed that black carbon is concentrated at the surface of\nthe sea ice but also found in smaller concentrations throughout\nthe ice, supporting the idea that black carbon deposited\nonto the surface of sea ice can be mobilized through the ice.\nIf there was a reduced black carbon mass ratio in the upper\nwww.the-cryosphere.net/11/2867/2017/ The Cryosphere, 11, 2867–2881, 2017\n', '2878 A.

Figure 11 shows the effect on the determination\nof the absorption cross section σabs, owing to absorption by\nimpurities and the ice scattering cross section at 400 nm, for\nchanging the value of g within possible values for sea ice:\n0.94–0.99 (Mobley et al., 1998).\nThe change in the g value has very little effect on the values\nof absorption cross section, as also noted by Libois et al.\n(2013), with variation in g between 0.94 and 0.99 having\nonly a factor of 0.092 effect on the absorption cross section,\ndemonstrating the model is insensitive to the value of g for\ndetermining light-absorbing impurities.\nIn the case of scattering cross section, the effect of changing\ng from 0.94 to 0.99 at 400 nm has a much larger effect\non the scattering cross section, with a larger g value giving a\nlarger scattering cross section – i.e. the similarity principle.\nAn increase in the scattering cross section would change the\nshape of the reflectance–wavelength curve as well as the values\nof reflectance, as absorbing impurities have less effect in\na sea ice with a large scattering cross section compared to a\nsmall one, as described in Marks and King (2014).\n5.1.4 Uncertainty in derived scattering and absorption\ncross section and black carbon mass ratio\nThe determination of the cross section for light scattering\nand absorption, described in Sect. 4.2.2, depends on varying\ntheir values to reproduce the measured values of the e-folding\ndepth and the nadir reflectivity within the experimental uncertainties\nof measured values of the e-folding depth and the\nnadir reflectivity, all as a function of wavelength. The latter\nassists in constraining the determination of the values of the\ncross section for absorption and scattering. The propagated\nuncertainty in the determined values of the cross sections for\nlight scattering and absorption from uncertainties in either\nthe value of the e-folding depth or nadir reflectivity in isolation\nhave not been calculated, as our method fits both e-\nfolding depth and reflectivity. Considering the experimental\nuncertainty in e-folding depth and nadir reflectivity gives a\nmore representative uncertainty of the process. The uncertainty\nin the reflectance and e-folding depth measurement\ndata of the undoped ice is shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Table 1\ngives an indication of the uncertainty in the derived scattering\ncross section, which is estimated by varying the values\nof σscatt and σabs and still obtaining a good fit (by eye) to the\nexperimental data within the uncertainties of the measured\ne-folding depth and nadir reflectivity.\n5.2 Realism of artificial sea ice\nThe sea ice simulator is designed to replicate natural sea ice\ngrowth in a controlled environment. Section 5.2 will review\nhow the measured physical and optical parameters of the sea\nice compare to field measurements of sea ice to ascertain\nhow the laboratory sea ice compares to natural ice. Although\nthe simulator creates a realistic sea ice environment, as with\nall simulators there are limitations in the degree to which a\n“natural” sea ice environment can be created. Limitations in\nthe following metrics were noted; light intensity, uneven ice\ngrowth, hyper-saline seawater, surface brine expulsion and\nreflectance measurements.\nTemperature profiles from the laboratory sea ice show a\nlinear increase in temperature from the surface to the ice\nbase; this has been commonly reported (e.g. Eicken, 2003;\nPerovich et al., 1998). Eicken (2003) suggested that at typical\nwinter temperatures ice would take ∼ 1 month to form\n50 cm; this is a similar growth rate to that observed for\nthe laboratory-grown sea ice, where it took approximately\n3 weeks to grow 30 cm of ice.\nTypical sea ice densities are reviewed by Timco and Frederking\n(1996) reporting first-year sea ice densities in the\nrange 0.84 to 0.94 gcm−3. The density of sea ice created in\nthe simulator ranged from 0.85 to 0.95 gcm−3, thus being in\nthe range of natural ice. Perovich et al. (1998) measured density\nprofiles through Arctic first-year sea ice showing no clear\nvariation with depth, which is also observed in the laboratory\nsea ice.\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2867–2881, 2017 www.the-cryosphere.net/11/2867/2017/\n', 'A. A. Marks et al.: Optical properties of BC-doped, laboratory-grown sea ice 2879\nPlots of salinity versus depth from ice cores from the sea\nice simulator show the distinctive “C” shape, with a higher\nsalinity seen at the base and top of the cores – see Fig. 6.\nMalgrem et al. (1927) studied salinity of first-year ice and\nalso found a characteristic “C” shape to the sea ice salinity\nprofile. The shape of the salinity profile, explained by Eicken\n(2003), is due to a combination of salt segregation, gravity\ndrainage and brine expulsion on the surface of the ice. Initially,\nas sea ice in the simulator grows, the seawater below\nthe ice increases in salinity and, similarly to natural sea ice,\nthe seawater below the ice is commonly hyper-saline. As the\nsimulator continues to generate thicker sea ice there is an increase\nin the salinity of the brine beneath the sea ice which\nmay eventually retard the growth and the water might become\nunrealistically saline if the experiment were to be al-\nlowed to continue. In the experiment discussed here this is\nnot a major problem, as the experiments were performed with\nice thicknesses of 30 cm.\nThe typical structure of a first-year sea ice is described\nby Eicken (2003) showing a granular surface layer, overlying\ncolumnar ice with granular/platelet ice at the ice–water\nboundary. The structure described by Eicken (2003) is the\nsame as that observed in ice cores of the laboratory-grown\nice. The surface of the laboratory-grown ice has a clear granular\ntexture, and at the base there is a slushy platelet layer,\nwith columnar ice in between.\nAlthough the sides of the tank are insulated, ice growth\nacross the tank is not quite uniform, with slightly thicker\nice (∼ 5 cm) around the edges of the tank towards the end\nof an experiment (∼ 3 cm from the sides) and around the\npolypropylene pole which the thermocouples were inserted\ninto. Unfortunately, the thicker ice areas could not be rectified,\nbut this was unimportant as reflectance measurements\nwere taken in the same place, away from the sides of\nthe tank. All measurements of the extinction coefficient/efolding\ndepth were made more than three e-folding depths\nfrom the sides of the tank so that any extra ice growth at\nthe edges of the tank would have no impact on the measurements.\nTypical extinction coefficients of sea ice at around 500 nm\nare around ∼ 0.03 cm−1 (Grenfell and Maykut, 1977). Calculated\nextinction coefficients for the laboratory-grown ice\nrange from 0.1 to 0.03 cm−1.\nOverall, the sea ice simulator creates a realistic sea ice,\nrecreating typical growth rates, salinity and temperature profiles,\nand reflectance and extinction coefficients of a first-year\nsea ice.\n6 Conclusions\nThe study has shown that the TUV-snow radiative-transfer\nmodel can reproduce reflectivity of undoped and blackcarbon-doped\nsea ice with different sea ice fabrics, and thus\nthe model can be used with confidence. Black carbon in laboratory\nsea ice has been shown to reduce the reflectivity of the\nice to 97, 90 and 79 % of the clean ice reflectivity at a wavelength\nof 500 nm for mass ratios of 75, 150 and 300 ngg−1\nof black carbon respectively in the top 5 cm layer of the laboratory\nsea ice, which is in agreement with radiative-transfer\ncalculations. To reproduce the reflectivity using the TUVsnow\nmodel, measured reflectivity and e-folding depth data\nfrom laboratory sea ice were used to derive scattering and absorption\ncross sections of the ice using the TUV-snow model.\nThe derived scattering cross section values are typical of sea\nice (e.g. Grenfell and Maykut, 1977; Timco and Frederking,\n1996; Perovich, 1996), while the derived absorption cross\nsections show the presence of other absorbing impurities in\nthe undoped ice, which match the absorption spectra of algae.\nData availability.
