A portion of the expense of the\ntimber cruise and court house building fund\nwas in last year\'s estimate.\nThe increase in general road tax is $5,213,\nmade necessary by the dilapidated condition\nof many of the bridges.\nThe great burden of taxation, however, has\nbeen voted upon themselves by the people of\nthe road and school districts in the special\ntaxes. Special school taxes have been in\ncreased $11,187.68 and special road taxes\nhave been increased $24,163.18. The total\namount available for roads and bridges during\nthe current year is $83,138.74.\nIt is an immense amount of money to raise\nby taxation for 1 oad purposes alone in a\nsingle year.\nWhat will the harvest be?\nIf expended economically under wise super\nvision, the investment will be the best taxpay\ners could possibly make. It is a great respon\nsibility for the county court and every super\nvisor in the county, and it is to be hoped that\nthey will co-operate heartily to produce good\nresults.

Between 250\nand 800 people were burned to death\nand many othera injured in a fire which\ndestroyed the Plorea theater in the city\nof Acapulco last night. The newa of\nthe dlaaater reached hero thia after\nnoon, telegraphic communication with\nAcapulco having been deiiroyed laat\nnight and today, owing to the fact\nthat the telegraph office adjoining the\ntheater waa destroyed and all wires\nput out of commission.\nThe Florea theater waa a wooden\nstructure and last night more than 1,\n000 people crowded into it to witness\na special performance given in honor\nof Governor Damian Klores, of the\nslate of Guerrero, One of the num\nbers on the program consisted of a\nseries of moving pictures. While th\noperator waa exhibiting these, a film\ncaught fire and the blaze waa quickly\ncommunicated to some bunting which\nhad been used for decorative purposes,\nIn an incredibly short time the flames\nspread to all parts of the structure.\nThere were but three narrow exits\nand the panic stricken audience rushed\nto them, many persons falling to be\ncrushed to death, their bodies choking\nthe way to eacape for others. The\nscreams of those imprisoned were ter\nrifying.\nOwing to the rapidity with which\nthe fire spread and its intense heat it\nwaa impossible to attempt rescue work,\nand those imprisoned were literally\nroasted alive, as the fire burned with\nlittle smoke and few were suffocated.\nHURLS BOMB FROM TRAIN.\nBlack Hand Agents in Gotham Use\nElevated Cara.\nNew York.

J. Newell,\nof the reclamation service, stated to\nday that orders had been issued to shut\ndown work on the Klamath irrigation\nproject, pending adjustment of differ\nncea between tha government and the\naettlera. Thia announcement follow\netuers must imy iiib annual mainte\nnance charge of 75 cents per acre, be\nginning May 1 next, and must mak\nten equal annual paymenta of $3 each\nper acre for the water right, the first\nwater payment falling due May\n1910.\nMany aettlera have announced that\nthey cannot pay $30 per acre for water,\nbut, aa thia ia tha actual proportionate\ncost of building the project the secre\ntary cannot accept less. He requested\ntha Water Users\' association to inform\nhim what it ia willing to do under the\ncircumstances, but aa it haa not made\nreply, he felt obliged to atop further\nconstruction until satisfactory agree\nment ia reached. The aettlera, under\nthe first unit of tha project, which ia\ncompleted, wili be furnished water\nthia eoming season, if they pay the\nmaintenance charge, but unleaa there\nla a speedy agreement construction of\nthe Clear lake reservoir will not be\ncarried forward and the aecond unit\nof tha project will remain undeveloped\nMeantime, Engineer Murphy,\ncharge of tha Klamath project haa\nbeen called to Washington and will be\naucceeded by W.

That the hold-up\nof the westbound Denver & Rio Grande\npassenger train, near Denver, at 3:15\nthis morning, waa the work of three\ninstead of two robbers and that the\nrobbery of the mail car gave them a\nloot of possibly $35,000, are indicated\nby the investigation of the railroad and\npolice officials today. So far no tangi.\nble clew to the identity or whereabouts\nof the robbers haa been found, but it\nseems probable that the men came to\nDenver and are now hiding in thia city.\nThe exact amount aecured by the\nrobbers cannot be ascertained. It is\nknown, however, that the registered\nmail sack from Colorado Springs to\nle nver waa empty and that little of\nvalue waa in the Pueblo-Denver sack.\nThe sack from Portland, Colo., to Den\nver, however, contained $400 of money\norder funda consigned to the Denver\npostoffice.\nThe robbery waa remarkable for its\noriginality and daring. It took place\nwithin eight miles of Dener, within\nless than two miles of Fort Logan, the\nUnited States military reservation.\nand at a spot where habitations are\nplentiful. Yet so thorough waa the\nwork of the robbers and so well were\ntheir plana laid that they had fully an\nhour and a half start of the officers.\nSearch of the vicinity of the bold-up\nindicates that a third man and poesibly\na fourth were engaged in the robbery ;\nthat a rubber-tired buggy waa in wait\ning for the actual hold-upa and that\ntorpedoes and red signal fires were\nused unsuccessfully in an attempt to\natop the train before the automatic\nrevolvers of the two men on the train\nwere used in doing thia.\nALL FAVOR LOCKS.\nGovernment Engineers Unanimous for\nPresent Canal Plan.\nWashington, Feb. 15. Colonel\nGeorge W.

The\nboard will report unanimously in favor\nof continuing the lock plan. Colonel\nGoethals said :\n"I repeat what I said to you a year\nago, and that ia that the canal will be\ncompleted and ships will be traversing\nit by February 1, 1915. Work on the\nwaterway is going ahead splendidly. I\nam to appear before the house commit\ntee on apropriationa Monday, when I\nwill be prepared to give an estimate of\nwhat the canal will coat.\n"In my judgment, the character of\nthe canal to be built has not changed\nin the least. The most acceptable\nplan ia that of the lock canal, which is\nthat now under construction. Any\ndanger of ships bumping into the gates\nor other parts of the locks, about which\nsome apprehension haa been expressed,\nwill be entirely averted by electrical\ndevices by which the vessels will be\nkept under control at all times."\nBlizzard Raging Again.\nDenver, Feb. 15.

As we unoer\nstand it, the State tax most be levied\nnpon the basis of property valuations,\nand it is manifestly unjust that the peo\nple of any county should . be made to\nBuffer because the rouutv assessor has\nrespected bis oath and has assessed\nproperty, as plainly required by the law.\nat its full cash value. That many as\nsessors bave not done this is very plain\nand probably ni more glaring instance\nof undervaluation .can be found than\nthat of Clatsop Connty, which is as\nsessed at S,7S2,420. while Columbia\nCountT. with probably one half of fue\nwealth of Clatsop, figures at .15,514,488.\nA glance at a few cf the items that\nmake up these totals is all that is neces\nsary to show their manifest disproportion,\nClatsop County has 478,997 acres of\nnon-tillable lands, assessed at $3,879,\'\n441.\nColombia Conntv has 406,134 acres\nof non-tillable lands, assessed at 18,910,\n835. The value of improvements on deeded\nor patented lands in Clatsop County is\nassessed at f 160,500.\nThe valne of improvements op deeded\nor patented lands in Columbia County\nis assessed at $424,243.\nThe valne of steamboats, sailboats,\nstationary engines and manufacturing\nmachinery in Clatsop County is assessed\nat 1109,900.\nThe same classification in Columbia\nConnty is assessed at $571,210.\nThe value of merchandise and sto k\nin trade in Clatsop is placed at (326,-\n762.\n\' - The same classification in Columbia\nis placed at $198,520.\nOf money, notes and accounts the as\nsessor of Clatsop County could find only\n$133,500, while the assessor of Columbia\nConnty found $419,198. Certainly not a\nvery good showing for a county contain\ning a city claiming to have over 15,000\ninhabitants and boasting of it business\nand manufactures.\nThe value of household furniture,\nwatches, jeweliy, etc., it placed by Clat\nsop\' assessor at only $08,900, while\nColumbia\'s aesesssor was able to find\nsimilar property worth $103,229.\nWe are willing to predict that Clatsop\nCounty\' salaried booster will never in\ncorporate tbee figures in any of the\ncity or county\'s advertising pamp!ets.\nAnd yet we are informed that Clatsop\'s\nassessor testified under oath before the\nState Board that these figures represent\ned the true cash value ol the property.\nOf course this was\'not true. Columbia\nwas one of the few counties in Oregon\nwhere the assessor respected his catli of\noffice and assessed at full cash value.\nWe believe this is nnderstood by the\nState Beard and that they will act ac\ncordingly, equalizing up to the hue cash\nvalue and thereby doing justice, instead\nof equalizing down and thereby paying\na premium on perjury and malfeasance\nin office. If, however, the oppo:ite\nconrse is pursued, the only proper thing\nis for Columbia County to refuse to pay\nits Ktate taxes and thereby compel the\nState to bring the matter before an equi\nty ourt.\nA LITTLE ADVICE.\nIt will be good policy for the saloon men\nof St. Helens to conduct their butine,\nas nearly as possible, in confonnit) with\npublic opinion, even if in doing so they\nkeep well within the limits of the law,\nfor public opinion nowadays can toon\ncrystallize into law and tha liquor deal\nera will be the losers thereby.\nIt Is a matter of common knowledge\nthat women were permitted to carouse\nin one of the saloons and it is very plaiu\nthat liquor is beings?! J to men to whom\nIt should not be sold, and in some in\nstances wherj the wivea have forbidden\nits sale. The money is needed by the\nwomorrand children and the man needs\nhi braln\'to transact Ills business and\nhis health to do his work. But this does\nnot appeal to all saloon men. They\nhave paid their liceme money and so\nlong a the law is not Invoked against\nthem they care nothing for tha injury\nthey Inflict npon tha com ni unity or tbj\nlos and mffisrin entailed npon the\ndrunkard\'a wife and children.\nAcouineleut business man and loving\nhusband ma be converted Into a bestial\nnonentity or a dangeroua brut, but the\ntaloon keeper justifies himaelf with the\nplea that he paye hi license and that if\nhe did not furniah the liquor on demand\nsomeone else would And there iome\ntruth n this, though It 1 by no mean\na justification. Competition In business\nIs one of the greatest incentive io unr-\nrepuiable methods. Millionaire, in or\nder to add to their wealth, are willing to\ntxiison the food supply and it took the\nstrong band of the govern oient to effect\neven a partial reform. Theie I no use\nof appealing to any motive except mat\nof self Interest, therefore we tell the\nMo uor dealer that it will pay them to\nget together and conduct their business\nso that it will da as little narm n pos\nsible.

NOW SS 1\nhave my doubts as to your sincerity iu\nthis respect, I wish to take exceptions\nto a statement made by you in the same\nissue, which follows:\n"The statement that the assessor\'s\nexpenses should come out of his salary\nis not apt to be indorsed by intelligent\ntaxpayers and reflects no credit on\nr.ilnn,bi.i Conntv\'s representative. Its\ninjustice is so manifest that no argu\nment is necessary."\nI presume that you imply, of course,\nto all exoenses of the assessor\'s office\nnot including books, stationery and\nstamps.\nSow I claim to" be a taxpayer of or\ndinary intelligence and I have a right to\nthat claim ai I have lived in the Neha\nlem Valley for 20 years and have made\na success at my occupation.\nNow. I. for one. positively object to\nSec. 4 of the assessor\'s liw for Columbia\nCjunty.\nFirst. Eecause it is directly in con\nflict with our constitutional rights, which\nprovide for "equal rights to all and spe\ncial privileges to none."\nSecond. Because it makes the salary\nof the assessor, as described in Section\n1 and 2 of said law, excessive.\nIn conjunction with Section 3 it en\ndows him with power to hire all the\nwork of his office dooe by deputies\nwhile he mav live at leisure and it fur\nther compels the county court to pay\nout the people\'s money for work for\nwhich the salary of 2,000 is amply suf\nficient. Why? Beciuse we are living\nunder a competitive system and there\nare plenty of good men who will do the\nwork of either the assessor or sheriff for\nthe alary prescribed in Section 1 and 2.\nAs in the case of Mr. A. S. Harrison\nwhen nominated by the Republicans and\nwas honorable enough to denounce the\nfaulty construction of Section 4 and the\nwav It was unsciupulouslv lobbied\nthrough a thoughtless legislature. And\nthen be was stabbed in the back by a\npolitical combination that exists in the\nneighborhood of our county seat.\nDon\'t thtnk for a minute, Mr. Editor,\nthat no argument is necessary, for there\nis a strong sentiment throughout Co\nlumbia County against this sort of pro\ncedure and it is my impression that the\npeople aa a whole are becoming very\ntired of being hood in Wed by the very\nmen that we have placed the most con\ndencein.\nYou say "there bas been nocomplaint\nthat the assessor bas been guilty of\ngrafting." Now I do not claim that any\ncounty officer is grafting, only indirectly\nthrough an unscrupulous law. which\nam sure, if left to the people, would be\ncast out.\nExcnse nie, but tell me why the sime\nlegislature did not enact a similar law\npertaining to the county clerk s office\nAs any well informed person knows.that\noffice has three times the work of any\nother oflbe in the county and reeeives\nthe least pay. Alluding to section 4 as\nbeing excessive and unjut, I wish to il\nlustrate the work of the assessor\'s office\nby myown rccupation.\nBeing a farmer I aim to run my tirin\non a practical basis. My wife, two chil\ndren and myself work hard the year\naround in all kinds of weather, pay our\nown expense and consider we do well if\nwe make five hundred dollars. And, by\nthe wav, we consider that we have just\nas blue blood in our veins as any county\nofficial and are willing to give them all\na good salary, suliicient for an up-to\ndate maintenance with no side grafts in\ncluded, and I certainly believe (here are\nplenty of good men in the county that\nwill acre it the office of assessor for the\nregular salary as prescribed by law in\nSec. 1 and 2. and w ill voluntarily place\nupon the rolls all property prescribed\nby law without the persistent action of\nthe grand jury. You may consider this\na complaint in as far as it goes, let it hit\nwho it will let them defend themselves,\n1 wish to call your atteniion to the fact\nthat we are not living in Russia, and we\ndo not propose the Grand Duke shall\nhave their way about everything.\nAnd you, my dear editor, may live to\nsee the dny when "Old Ireland will have\nher liberty."\nAnd the interest that is being ex\npress by our present Representative\niu the repeal of tin\'s unjust measure cer\ntainly adds much credit to him s a true\nrepresentative of the people.\nNow all I will ask of you ia to give me\nroom in the columns of your paper and\nI will endeavor to demonstrate to whom\nit may concern that there it alwavt two\nsides to a que tron.\nSubmitting till for publication I am\nYervftapeclfully\n\'e. E. MCKER80N.\nUt\nTo Mr. Nickerson and all others con\ncerned : Your first paragraph conveys\nan insult which ordinarily should de\nprive vou of any right to apace In thi\npaper. Nevertheless 1 propose to an\nswer you and try to convince you that\nyou are wrong-. The editor personally\ncares nothing whatever for Mr. Nioker\noii opinion. It would be easy to get a\nlist of a hundred of the heaviest laxyay-\ners in thi county who do not believe a\ntingle county Ulcer receives a cent\nmore salary than he U Justly entitled to,\nbut such a list would have no eAect on\nMr. Nickerson or bis Ilk, for the Bible\nsays, "The tool is wise in ins own con\nceit." As to the third section ol the law the\neditor ol ti e Mist said it was faulty and\nshould be amended, therefore the dis\ncussion is as to the font 111 section only.\nwhich provide that all casta? ex\npect s of the assessor and his deputy\nshall be paid by the county.\nThe statemeut made by Mr. Nicker\nson in the second count of hi letter that\nthe assessor receives $2000 i untrue\nThe salary is f 1200 and the offioe deputy\nreceives M00 per annum. Thi Is not\nchange by Mr. Convert\' bill.\nThe county court, under the present\nlaw, Is required to pay only the neces\nsary expenses. If iu its Judgment the\nassessor\'s expense account or any item\nof it Is excessive it can refuse payment\nand the assessor would have to relin\nquish his claim or bring su t in the clr\ncuit court. Mr. Conyers\' bill will not\nalter this nor save the county one cent,\nIt will not, in other words, accomplish\nthe injustice it attempts,\nExcuse me, Mr. Nickerson, but as you\nwish to know why the Legislature did\nnot post a law providing for payment of\nthe c!erk\' expenses, will yon please ex\nplain why Representative Cooyers did\nnot introduce a bill repealing the much\nstronger provision for the payment of\nexpeiiMS of the sheriff\' office, whose\nsalary is J-00 per annum higher than\nthat of the assessor. It your blue blood\nwill permit it, stand np on your hind\nlegs and tell the ignorant editor how\nyou explain this except upon the theory\nof spitework or favoritism Rend that\nsection of tbe sheriff\'s law and then ex\nplain. Your statement Hut the county\nclerk\'s office receives less pav than any\nother ottice in the county is certainly\nnews to the clerk, and illuitMte the\ncareless manner in which you handle\nstatistics. The clerk\' salary is $1400\nper annum and he has oae office deputy\nand additional help wiien he considers it\nnecessary for the proper discharge ot his\nduties. We hope yuo have no blue\nblood in your veins for blue blood i\ndiseased blood and you really don\'t need\nit. Still, we will take word that yonr\nblood is as blue as indigo and as impure\nas your thoughts are uncharitable.\nNow, aa to the clerk\'s office: There is\nno dispute as to the ability and efficiency\nof tbe present clerk. But, if yon will\nremember, the county court refused at\none lime to give Mr. Harris ths he\'p he\nthought ueces:try to prepare the tax\nroil \'I In ltw nude no specific provi\nsion for such expense, so Mr. Harris\ncomp\'ied with ths law, and, after due\nwarning to the county court that the\nroll would null ready for the sheriff\nnnle s help was granted, did his regu\nlar stunt of eight hours er day and let\nthe court do the worrying. Kttilt:the\ncourt Mil rendered to the clerk, but the\nunnecessary delay caused by its clili\nnacy cost Columbia County several hun\ndred dollars. I suppose yoa remember\nthat Mr. Harris was re-elected by a very\nlarge nuij jrity last Jui.e, which may\nfairly be taken as an indorsement by the\npeople of his official coarse.\nAs to Mr. lljrrism being beaten ty\nthe St. Helen ring, the .Mi it submits a\nfew figures for your careful considera\ntion, if yon ever do any considering: Tbe\nvote iu June gave Clark a plurality of\n108 over Harrison, while the Republican\ncandidate forCongrett bad a plurality of\nabout 800, therefore Mr. Harriion ran\n900 behind the straight Republican vote\nthroughout the county. The fact is, and\nMr. IlarrifOii admit it, he wat beaten\nbecause the voters of the county believed\nhim to be the candidate of the timber\nSpeculators. Clatskanie precinct, wliich\nwhich gsve him a inalorily at the pri\nmary gave a majority of thirty for Clark\nat the gener.il electior.
