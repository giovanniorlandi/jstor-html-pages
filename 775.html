HALL\nPublic Asked to Insist That\nFederal Funds be Not With\ndrawn from Road Building\nDanger That Program of Im\nprovement Cannot Continue\nUnless Pressure Is Brought\nIdaho\'s policy of road improvement,\nwhich means many miles of permanent\nstandard highway in Idaho county,\nthrough cooperation of the federal gov\nernment, is likely to be held up, be\ncause of retrenchment by congress in\nthe matter of appropriations. This\nis the word sent out by the depart\nment of public works at Boise, of\nwhich William J. Hall is commission\ner.\nCOMMUNICATION FROM HALL\n"This department is in receipt of\nadvices from Washington," says a\ncommunication from Mr. Hall, "to the\neffect that the slogan of all party\nloaders in both house and senate is\n\'economy and retrenchment,\' and that\nit will require concentrated effort\non the part of those interested in the\ncontinuance and extension of road\nwork to obtain favorable action. Un\ndoubtedly a sincere effort to inaugu\nrate a policy of economy and retrench*\nment will meet with hearty and wide\nspread approval, but most persons will\nagree that there is plenty of room for\nthe exercise of such policy without\ncutting off appropriations which are\nvital to the highway improvement of\nevery state in the Union.\n"If additional federal aid appropri\nations are not made at this time, it\nwill mean that many comprehensive\nconstruction programs must be\nabandoned, and that the people who\nhave voted for bond issues with the\nexpectations of receiving cooperative\nfederal funds will become discouraged,\nand that the cooperative spirit\nand enthusiasm for road con\nstruction which has grown up in\nthe past few years will die of\ninanition.\n"The principle of federal aid -in\nhighway construction hag been demon\nstrated to be sound, and that it is\npopular and I in« had/ \'-jhei effect of\nencouraging road building, is evidenc\ned by the fact that for each dollar of\nfederal funds made available for co\noperative work, it is estimated that\nmore than six dollars state, county,\nand highway district funds have been\nraised for the same purpose.\nROAD WORK MAY FALL\n"If federal aid is not continued\nthere is grave danger that the road\nprograms now formulated will receive\na setback from which it will require\nyears to recover. Nearly every com\nmunity in Idaho has such a program\nand lias provide,] funds to apply on its\nconstruction, in whole or in part, dur\'\ning the next three or four years. It\nfollows, therefore, that every commu\nnity in Idaho is interested in the con\ntinuance and extension of federal aid.\n"In order to demonstrate that the\nsentiment of the people of the coun\ntry is overwhelmingly in favor of\nprompt and liberal action, it is re\nquested that every board of county\ncommissioners, every board of high\nway district commissioners, every\ncity council, every chamber of com\'\nmerce, or commercial club, in fact\nevery public or semi-public body, pass\nresolutions asking congress for feder\nal aid appropriations; and that cop\nies of such resolutions be forwarded\nimmediately to Burton L. French, Ad\ndison T. Smith, W. E. Borah, and .T.\nF. Nugent, and to the clerks of house\nof representatives and U. S. senate.\nLetters from private citizens would\nalso be of value."\nWOULD MAKE AMERICAN\nCITIZENS OF INDIANS\nFull American citizenship would he\nconferred upon all Indians born with\nin the United States, under a bill paa\nsod recently by the ^latSonal house\nWashington.\nof representatives\nTlie bill also provides for final dispo\nsition of tribal property among such\nIndians as \'are adjudged competent to\nadminister thoir own affairs.

S. senate by Sen\nator Phelan, of California of a bill de\nsigned to prevent ownership of land\nby Japanese, who are native-born of\nthe United States, and therefore pre\nsumed to be American citizens, and\nentitled to the full lights of citizen\nship.\nOwnership of real estate is denied\nto Japanese and Chinese not born\nwithin the United States, and states\nof the west, into which has come a\ngroat influx of oriental population, es\npecially from Japan, within the last\nfew years, have been obliged to .seek\nadditional protection from the en\ncroachment of the wiley yellow men\nupon Americans and their virtual eli\nmination of Americans from many\nlines of business on the Pacific coast,\nnotably the hotel and restaurant busi\nnesses, truck gardening :in<l seul\' ice*\nas porters and household servants.\nNow, the two latter classifications\nhave not so much worked to the det\nriment of the white man ns have the\nformer. In many districts of Califor\nnia. especially near the larger cities,\nthere reside entire colonies of Japan\nese, engaged iif market gardening. By\ntheir thrift, energy, perseverance and\nfrugality, they are aide to more in\ntensively cultivate tho land than is\nthe white man, to garner more from\ntho soil, so to speak, and to sell the\nproducts to tlie consumer for a low\ner price. Still, ownership of real es\ntate was denied to the Japanese im\nmigrants and their progress on the west\ncoast of America was proportionately\nretarded, until the "picture bride"\nmethod of defeating the purpose of\nexisting laws preventing Japanese\nfrom acquiring title to real estate\ncame, into vouge, with the approval of\nthe Imperial Japanese government.\nBy the picture bride scheme, pic\ntures of Japanese women in Japan\nwere sent by mail to Japanese men\nresiding in the United States. The\nJapanese who had emigrated to the\nUnited States selected from among\nthe pictures his future wife, an agency\nin Japan was notified, a proxy mar\nriage between the two was celebrated,\nand at the same time recognized by\ntho Japanese government. The Jap\nanese woman in Japan, then, was the\nwife of the Japanese man in America\nand under American immigration laws\nwas permitted to join her husband in\nAmerica.\nThe purpose of tho "picture bride\'\'\nscheme was sinister, for it was merely\na plot to defeat America \'s immigration\nrestrictions, and\nfurther Japan\nese interests on the west coast in fact,\nto permit Japanese t 0 become owners\nof real estate.\nb\nOnce the picture bride arrived and\njoined her husband in California, Ore\ngon or Washington, Japanese inter\nests in America were strengthened,\nfor rapidly there came upon the scone\nJapanese children, born on American\nsoil, and therefore presumably Enti\ntled to all the rights and privileges\nof an American citizen, including own.\nership of land. Large tracts of land\nwere purchased by the elder Japanese,\nin the names of these babes, yet in\ntheir cradles, and Japanese business\nwent forward unhampered.\nRecently, however, on protests from\ntlie United States, the Japanese gov\nernment has promised to halt the\n"picture bride" practice, and no more\nwill Nipponese "picture brides" be\npermitted to leave for the United\nStates.\nBut the Japanese cheek on "picture\nbrides" has not "aimed residents of\nthe const, nor placated them in their\ndetermination to retain American soil\nfor Americans, as is evidenced by Sen\nator Phelan \'s bill, which would deny\ncitizenship to all persons born of par\nents ineligible to become American\ncitizens. If such measure is enacted\nby tho congress of the United States,\nand is held constitutional, American\ncitizenship would bd forever (denied\nto orientals, and thus their material\nprogress on the east coast of the Pa\ncific would be greatly retarded.\nBut, does not the American consti\ntution, in its fourteenth amendment,\ndefine American citizenship when it\n\'All persons born or\nni 1\nii at\nsays :\nized in the United States and subject\nto the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens\nof the United States and of the state\nwherein they reside\nYet, sustaining by the courts of\n"grandfather clauses" in southern\nstates, designed to prevent negroes\nfrom voting,, may furnish precedent\nfor a measure such as Senator Phelan\nhas introduced, to abridge the rights\nof Japanese born in America.\nTAXES A CAMPAIGN ISSUE ?\nPrevailing high taxes in Idah 0 give\npromise of becoming an issue in the\nnext state campaign. Already inter\nesting discussions, iu an effort to place\nresponsibility for the high state levy,\nare heard, both from Democratic and\nRepublican mouthpieces in the south,\nand ere long, it is promised, a battle\nroyal will ensue and one or the other\nof the combatants will die, at least\nfor two years, so far as management\nof tho state\'s business is concerned.\nTaxes levied by the state for the\nlast year were abnormally high, com\npared with former levies, but support\ners of the administration argue that\ntaxes in Idaho at the present time, are\nnot nearly so high, as in adjoining\nstates, and that great public improve\nments are being made.\nIt is further argued that Governor\nAlexander, under whose administration\ntaxes were nominal, permitted many\ndeficiencies to exist, which have been\nmet by recent levies. Further allega\ntions are made that Governor Alex\nander, in the name of economy, per\nmitted state institutions to deterior\nate, and tliat extraordinary expendi\ntures were necessary to restore these\ninstitutions to their former state of ef\nficiency.\nHowever, in view of th e "taxless"\nplatform on which fhe present gover\nnor staged one of his campaigns sev\neral years ago, a conglomeration of\nexcuses for present-day high taxes ap\npears ludicrous.\nFOR SALE—White enameled crib\nand one mattress suitable for child up\nto 2 years.
