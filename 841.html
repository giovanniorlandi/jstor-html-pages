Jr. to Devote His Time to\nSupervising Immense Charity.\nYoung Mr. Rockefeller\'s Place on Di\nrectorate of Standard Oil Company\nWill Not Be Filled as the Board\nVoted at the Last Meeting ta Reduce\nthe Number of Directors From Fif\nteen to Fourteen.\nIt was learned in New York last\nweek that, the directorate of the\nStandard Oil company had been re\nduced on Jan. 11 from fifteen to four\nteen members and that the name ol\nJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr., had been\nomitted from the lint of directors foi\nthe curreut year. Mr. Rockefeller\'s\nretirement from the board, together\nwith the statement made at the offices\nof the Standard Oil, lends to the nat\nural conclusion that the younger\nRockefeller will devote his time to\nthe supervision of the immense char\nitable project embodied in the Rocke\nfeller foundation, a bill for the incor\nporation of which was Introduced in\ncongress Wednesday.\nFurthermore John D. Rockefeller,\nJr., bas resigned from many other\nbonrds of late and his resignation\nfrom the board cf managers of the\nDelaware, Lackawanna and Western\nand the American Unseed company of\nwhich he Is a director Is expected to\ntake place In the near future. It was\nsaid at the Standard Oil offices that\nyoung Mr. Rockefeller had not been\nas active In the management of the\ncompany ns his position as director\nmight seem to Indicate.\nThe new Rockefeller foundation is\nat present but vaguely outlined. In\nSenator Galllngor\'s bill there Is a par\nagraph stating the objects of the un\ndertaking: "To promote well being\nand to advance the civilization of the\npeoples of the United States and its\nterritories and possessions, and of\nforeign lands, In the acquisition and\ndissemination of knowledge, In the\nprevention and relief of suffering, and\nIn the promotion of any and all of the\nelements of human progress." Th\'ia\nreads the prospectus of an orgar.lzp\nHon which, according to a statem?r\nmade by Frederick T. Gates, Is some\nthing new.\n"Kvery other charitable Institution\nhas been organized," said ie, "for\nsome specific object. The new scheme\ndiffers from them all in that It is lim\nited In Its activities to no particular\nrace, religion, time, place or method.\nIt will be a reserve fund In time of\ncalamity and it can be used for any\nemergencies that may arise."\nStarr J. Murphy said that it would\nbe Impossible to discuss the actual\nworking out of this Inclusive project\nuntil congress had taken action, nor\ncould he say what would become of\nthe bulk of Mr. Rockefeller\'s fortune.\nThe general education board which\nmay In time be superseded by the\nfoundation received $.13,000,000 from\nMr. Rockefeller. He himself has said\nthat his fortune cannot exceed $300,\n000,000. HARAHAN TO RETIRE\nAs President of the Illinois Central;\nUnderwood Possible Successor.\nJames T. Harahan will retire from\npresidency of the Illinois Central road\nto become chairman of directors,\na position that Is to be created for\nhim. The change In the active man\nagement of the road Is scheduled to\ntake place at a meeting of the direc\ntors In New York on Wednesday of\nthis week.\nMr. Harahan\'s retirement is due to\nhis desire to he relieved of the bur\nden of active management and to re\nmain with the property which he has\naided In building up, but to remain In\na capacity where the strain on his\nhealth Is not so severe.\nIt is understood that a successor to\nMr. Harahan has been decided upon\nprovided the man the directors hope\nto secure will accept the position. F.\nD. I\'nderwood, president of the Erie,\nIs said to be one of the men In view,\nand Howard Elliott, president of the\nNorthern Pacific, the other.\nTHOMAS COLLIER PLATT DEAD\nBrlght\'s Disease Direct Cause of For\nmer Senator\'s Death.\nFormer United Stales Senator\nThomas Collier Piatt, Republican lead\ner of the state of New York for a score\nof years and intensely Interested In\nthe Republican party from Its organ\nization In 185(, died unexpectedly on\nSunday afternoon, In his apartments\nt 133 West Uth street. He would\nhave been 77 years old if he had lived\nuntil next July 13. The direct cause\nof Mr. Piatt\'s death was acute Brlght\'s\ndisease.\nThe end was stai tllngly sudden. An\nhour before the senator died his two\neons. Frank and Edward, with their\nfamilies, and his widowed son Harry,\nwith the la tier\'s daughter, Charlotte,\nand lion Sherman, had left the house,\nafter their usual Sunday visit. Mr.\nPiatt said at that time that he felt\nvery well and thought he would read\nthe Sunday papers.\nShould Favor Timbered Land.\nThe state foresters\' conference at\nHarrlsburg, Pa., was addressed by\nDr. J. T. Rothrock, president of the\nEtate forestry commission, and John\nFulton, state engineer, of Johnstown.\nJohn E. McNeill said other stales do\nnot tax growing crops and that the\nsame principle might be applied to\ngrowing timber. Tho point was also\nmade that such a policy would result\nin reforestation.\n40,000 MEN QUIT WORK\nOut of Sympathy With Striking Phil\nadelphia Car Men.\nThe unions in uympathy with the\ncar men In Philadelphia struck on\nSaturday morning. Simultaneously\nIt became known that every Na\ntional Guard regiment in tho state ol\nPennsylvania has received orders to\nbe ready to entrtaln for Philadelphia\nat an hour\'s notice. General Clay,\nhefd of the police force, denies it. II\nhai pens, however, to be true.\nAt least 40,000 men of a hundred\ndifferent trades did not show up for\nwork that morning. The labor leaders\nere shouting \'exultantly that 100,000\nmen have lined up with the striking\nmotormeu and conductors. The po\nlice canvassers make the figure less\nthan 21,000. An impartial estimate Is\n40,000, a little more or a little less.\nThe outlook Is ominous, even to the\nmost cheerful observers. So much\nbitterness has develoed In the past\nfew days that the people of Philadel\nphia are preparing for any kind of\ntrouble. An hour\'s walk in sections\nof the city, such as Kensington, where\nthe feeling against the P. R. T. Is\nmost Intense, is sufficient for anyone\nto understand what is smouldering.\nKensington, where two-thirds of the\nunion men live, will be the seat of\ntrouble. The streets are crowded\nwith strikers and their hangers on.\nThey spend part of their time In the\ncorner Baloons, the other part in\nstanding cn the street coiners and\ncursing the non-union car crews. The\npolice are preparing for a riot at the\nvery outset.\nThe labor bosses spread the prom\nise late at night that no union man\nwould throw a brick or participate In\nany resistance to the police or the\nmilitary. The promise was accepted\nfor Just what It is worth. With 40,000\nmen idle and sore because they were\ndrawn Into a general strike, no one\nsupposes that the leaders can keep\nthe peace. If any one had confidence\nIn the police force, the prospect would\nnot be so unpleasant. But nobody has,\n111 even the commanders. Rioters\nhave taken the policemen of the city\nby the scruff of the neck and wiped\nup the back streets with them.\nCARNEGIE; FOUND $3,000,000\n.Devoted $250,000 of It to a Fund For\nPittsburg Teachers.\nProfessor John Brashear, who rep\nresents Audrew Carnegie In many\nthings, has rented a suite of offices\nin Pittsburg from which he and\nothers will handle the business of\nCarnegie relative to the distribution\nof proceeds from an endowment fund\nrecently created by Mr.. Carnegie for\nthe public school teachers of Pitts\nburg. This fund will produce $12,000\nannually In Interest over the running\nexpenses of the office and Mr. Bras\nhear has sent out calls to teachers for\nsuggestions as to how this money can\nbe best Bpent in the Interest of pub\nlic teachers of Pittsburg.\nThis brings out also the story that\nMr. Carnegie belore he decided to\ngive $250,000 as a fund for helping\nalong school teachers of Pittsburg\nfound to his surprise one morning\nthat he had $3,000,000 that ho had not\nthought he possessed. This worried\nthe former steel king greatly and he\nsent for some of his Pittsburg ad\nvisers.\' It was finally decided that he should\ngive a quarter million to a fund for\npublic school teachers of Pittsburg\nand also nine other cities whose\nnames will be announced later. Mr.\nCarnegie, however, Insists on hU\nname not appearing In connection\nwith the donations.\nASK FOR MEDIATION\nLeaders of Insurrection Realize Their\nCause Is Hopeless.\nThe leaders of the revolution in\nNicaragua have appealed to the Unit\ned States for mediation of the pres\nent difficulty In order to bring about\npeace.\nA dispatch was received at the\nstate department from Thomas P.\nMotTatt, American consul at Blue\nfields, where the headquarters of the\nrevolutionary government are located,\nsaying that the leaders of the insur\nrection realized that their cause was\nhopeless and they wished the United\nStates to mediate. The state depart\nment has the request under advise\nment. SODS AND SHAMROCKS\nLarge Quantities Shipped From South\nampton For Irish Fellowship\nClub of Chicago.\nThe American liner St. Ixwls, bound\nfrom Southampton for New York,\nwhich sailed from Queenstown on\nMarch 4, carried a quantity of Irish\nsods and hundreds of packets of sham\nrocks for the Irish Fellowship club of\nChicago. It Is before this club that\nPresident Tatt is to speak on S!\nPatrick\'s day and Ihe suds are for a\nsquat e on which he Is to t-tuncl so that\nhe may speak from liish soil when he\ndelivers his address on the feast\nday of Irel\'ind\'s patron saint.\nRecount Elects Municipal Reformer.\nLondon, March S. A recount of the\nballots cast on Saturday in the Fim\nbury divi-slon for a member of the\nLondon county council gives the Mu\nnicipal Reform candidate a majority\nof one. This makes the Municipal\nReform party\'s majority In the new\ncouncil two so far as elected members\nare concerned, but seven by Including\nthose aldermen who retain seats In\ntho present, council.\nBOYCOTT BY\nUNIONS\nOrdered Not to PatronizeStores\nThat Supply Company or Men.\nSomething Seems to Have Induced\nStrikers and Their Sympathizers\nto Refrain From Violence Learned\non Authority That Another Out\nbreak of Rioting Will Mean the Ex\necution of Warrants Against the\nCommittee of Ten of the Central\n\' Labor Union.\nPhiladelphia, March 8. The labor\nunions have played their left bower\na boycott. Orders have been sent\nto every labor union man In Philadel\nphia not to patronize stores that sell\nsupplies to the Philadelphia Rapid\nTransit company or Its employes.\nThey estimate that they can deprive\nthe merchants of this city of $1,000,000\nworth of business a day and that they\ncan force the business Interests of the\ncity to take their side In the fight If\ntho pressure is maintained long\nenough and severely enough.\nSaloon keepers are complaining\nthat their bars are banned because\nthey have sold beer to the loyal em\np\'.oyes of the Rapid Transit company.\nStorekeepers In Kensington, German-\ntown, Frnnkfori and other centers of\ntho strike have been hurt sariJto,\nSomething seems to have jJmed the\nstrikers. Although the mfhufactur-\nIng districts were crowded with Idle\nmen who stood on the street corners\nand Jeered the Rapid Transit opera\ntlves and the policemen, the fellows\ndid not lay a hand to a brick or dare\nto shove a blnecoat.\nUnloubtedly the firm attitude of\nMayor Reyburn and his director of\npublle safety had a great deal to do\nwith restraining the men on strike\nand their sympathizers. After the de\ncision of the mayor and his advisers\nto arrest the labor union leaders who\nare responsible for the present con\ndition of affairs became known, the\nleaders hurriedly sent word to their\nlieutenants actively In command of\nthe strikers to keep their men peace\nful nnd discourage anything like riot\ning. It was learned on authority that\nanother outbreak of rioting will mean\nthe- execution of warrants against the\ncommittee of tm of the Central Labor\nunion and other leaders who are dl\nrecting the big stnke. Both the may\nor and Henry Clay, the director of\npubl\'c safety, believe that the strike\nwill fizzle out.\nThe city officials and the merchants\nagree that a sympathetic strike need\nalarm nobody so long as rioting Is\nkept down.\nThe National Guard Is In readiness\nfor strike duty here. The regiments\nare under orders to start at an hour\'s\nnotice.\nPLAN A STATEWIDE STRIKE\nMovement to Have All Union Men In\nPennsylvania Quit Work.\nPittsburg, March 8.-Within the next\n48 hours, If Pittsburg labor leaders\ncan effect It, all union workmen In\nthe state of Pennsylvania will be or\ndered to stop work In sympathy with\nthe striking street car men of Phil\nadelphia. President Kelly of Ihe Iron\nCity Central Trades council set the\nmovement on foot and he Is backed\nby Business Agent J. J. Thorpe of di\nvision 85, Amalgamated Association of\nStreet and Electric Railway employes\nof America In chaige of the Pittsburg\ndistrict. Kelly made the following\nanouncement:\n"The annual convention of the\nPennsylvania State Federation of\nLabor opens in New Castle tomorrow\nmorning and some action will be tak\nen regarding the Philadelphia strike.\nI feel sure that if a vote was taken\nfor the general strike throughout the\nstate there would not be a dissenting\nvoe. I have personally visited Phil\nadelphia and assured the strikers that\nwe are with them and that I favor\naction."\nCONSTITUTION WANTED\nPrince Promised to Appoint a Commis\nsion to Consider the Question.\nTails, March 8. A dispatch from\nMonaco lo the Matin says the people\nof that little principality have de\nmanded a con ititution. Some 700\nmade a demonstration Sunday. Dele\ngates appointed by tho demonstrators\ninterviewed the Prince of Monaco,\nwho promised to uppoint a commis\nsion to consider the question.

Ellis, the\nformer assistant to the attorney gen\neral and now chairman of the Ohio\nRepublican executive committee, were\nguests of the president at luncheon\nyesterday. The president\'s lunchen\nInvitation to Mr. Ellis was Intended\nas his answer to the report that he\ntad repudiated Mr. Ellis. The reports\nfrew out of the letter written by the\npresident to Mr. Davis In which he\ndisclaimed any responsibility for the\nselection of Mr. Ellis as head of the\nexecutive committee.\nWhen Mr. Ellis got back to Wash\nington from Ohio on Saturday the\npresident decided that he ought to do\nsomething for him just to show that\nthere was no thought of repudiation"\nIn his letter. It was made known that\nboth the president and Mr. Ellis were\nsurprised at the construction placed\non the Davis letter. The president,\nIt was said further, had written sev\neral confidential letters to friends In\nOhio after Mr. Ellis was named as\nchairman, explaining that he was not\nsent to Ohio as the personal repre\nsentative of the president, at all and\nthet he had no authority for the ad\nministration to clioose candidates or\nput a White House tinge on political\nevents In Ohio.\nRESULTS OF FLOOD\nState of New York Will Be Called On\nto Pay Heavy Damages.\nUtica, N.

The\nrise of the mercury and the heavy rains\nof Sunday released the ice in the creek.\nThis was so unmistakable omen of coin\ning disaster. Late id ibe evening of tbe\nSabbath the waters began to rise and\nwatchers were stationed on the bridge\nthat spans the creek to keep tbe people in\ntouch with tbe situation. Monday morn\ning found the creek lull to tbe top of iis\nbanks. All day the waters remained in\nthis threatening attitude. Tuesday there\nwas no precept i ble change. Early Tues\nday morning large Rorge. located Just\nabove town, broke and in twenty min\nutes tbe main street was barricaded lib\nice from tbe botel to the Wheeler tract on\nthe north.

A\nrecount of heads showed that no lives\nwere lost. Tbe loss to property was less\nthan expected. Mrs. Andrews is the\nhesvlest loser.

Tbe town is\nto be cougratulaled upon this latest ad\ndition to its already commendable list of\npublic buildings. It is probably no ex\naggeration, and only stating a conceded\nfact, to say tbat in ber church edifices\nTionesta is now probably more favored\nthan any otber town of the same size in\ntbe state, three modern church edifices\nhaving been finished in tbe town within\na vear.\nTbe work of razing the old edifice upon\nthe siteof which tbe new one is built,\nwas begun on September 8th of last year,\nana tms ween win witness tbe coin pie-\nlion of the new one. The style of the\nstructure is modern Gothic, witb Dinner\nous projections and a tower so blending in\nits design as to produce the most pleasing\nellect. The material is pressed red brick\nwitn light gray stone trimmings over toe\narches, doorways and windows. Tbe\nbuilding faces upon Elm street fifty feet\naud runs back from that street one hun\ndred feot. The main entrance is at tbe\nsoutheastern corner and leads into a ves\ntibule twelve feet square, wbicb is laid in\ngreen and white tile. Leading from this\nvestibule are two entrances into the audi\ntorium, one of wbicb opens to the right\nana tne other directly in trout. Toe bu\nditorium is thirty by forty-two feet in\nsize, with a seating capacity of about 200,\nIt is seated with finely polished oak seats,\ncircular in arrangement, aud elevated\nfrom tbe rear, facing the pulpit and choir\nloft looking north. The view from tbe\nseats is easy aud tbe acoustic properties\nof the room are perfect. Tbe walls are\ncircular in shape, surmounted by a hand\nsome dome in three parts aud art glass\nlights. The pulpit and floors are in high\nly polished oak. In general, tbe furnish\nings and arrangements of tbe room leaye\nnothing to be desired by tbe most crili-\nical. Everything is strictly modern in\ndesign aud conception, and harmonious\nin tone and effect.\nTbe main Sabbath School room, 30x50\nfeet in size, is located immediately west\nof tbe auditorium. This room has two\nopenings from tbe auditorium and an\noutside entrance through a vestibule on\nthe south side of tbe building. One of\nthe openings from the auditorium is\ntwelve feet in size, permitting tbe use ol\nthe room to increase tbe sealing capacity\ntor aervlces In the main auditorium\nThis opening Is closed by a very ingeol\nously arranged decorated curtain, so con\'\nstructed as to be lilted without noise or\nconfusion. Twelve separate class rooms\nopen from this main Sabbath school\nroom, six of which are located on tbe first\nfloor, and six upon tbe second floor. But\ntwo of these class rooms are entirely sep\narated from tbe main room, that for the\nBible class and one for tbe infant class,\nAr. easy stairway leads from tbe side ves\ntibule to the class rooms on the second\ntloor. Tbe main room for the school, as\nwell as tbe clans rooms, are grained In\nQuartered iiolden oak.\nThe pastor\'s study and reception room\nis conveniently located to the roar of the\ncboir loft. I Ins room will be appropri\nately furnished and Is, as it should be.\none of the most comfortable in the entire\nbuilding. Above the main vestibule, in\ntbe tower, a small room bas been nicely\nnnished, the entrance to wblon is by stair\nway from the vestibule.\nNo part of tbe entire structure has been\nmore carefully or Judiciously planned\nthan tbe basement, and this shows very\ncommendable zeal and Intelligence upon\nthe part of the church authorities. In the\nbasement are locatod a large general re\nception room, a kitchen, tbe beating com\npartments, and separate lavatories and\ntoilet rooms for ladies and gentlemen.\nThe kitchen is furnished with a gas\nrange, shelving and oabinets, and all ueo\nessary apparatus for cooking and serving\nat church suppers. The general room is\nfurnished with every facility for the re\nception of friends and tbe service of such\nsuppers, there being several large port\nable tables. H e boating compartment\nis provided with an automatic steam\nheater. In short there seems to be noth\ning left In this important department lo\nbe desired. Tbe basement is 80x50 feet\nin size snd Is finished iu natural Georgia\npine and bas a cement tloor.\nMessis.

Kohl, of Oil City, and the\nprevailing color is old ivory, blending\ninto darker shades, terminating in an\necru base with a grape vine frieze of em\nhlematic Biblical significance. The ceil\ning and side walls are embellished witb a\ndelicate tinted border, harmonizing with\na color scheme of the most resttul and\npleasing ellect.\nThe work of painting and graining the\ninterior wood work and the finishing of\nthe hardwood floors in both the auditor\nium and Sunday school rooms was done\nby our townsman, G.

I\'nor to this an\nleading up to it was a Sabbath school, or\ngaolzed about 1848, by Mr, Hamilton\nStow, who was its superintendent, witb\nmiss Anna May, afterwards Mrs. Job\nLamb, and Miss Eva Scott, who after\nward married Win. Hulings, as teachers\nThis was a uuion school aud remained bo\nlor msny years after the organization of\ntbe cburcb. In laii, ibe congregation\nhaving grown in numbers, and support\'\nIng a pastor for part time, organized\nschool of its own, thus making it denom\ninational. Divine services being con\nducted at stated intervals by the Revs\nBabcock and Hampson.of Titusville, an\nDr. Craighead, of Meadville, tbe congre\ngallon began to look about idem tor\npermanent place to worship and accord\nly set about tbe erection ot a suitable\nbuilding. A lot was purchased by Mrs,\nMargaret May, wife of Rev. Hezekiab\nMay, and by her donated to the trustees\nof tbe Presbyterian church for cburcb\npurposes, A subscription paper which\nwas cirulated contained the names cf\ntbirly-tbree persons whose aggregate sub\nscripttoiis amounted to $1,1!00. Tbe\nwork ol erecting tne building was begun\nTbe "bill of expense shows ibiu the com\npleted building cost SI, 0i7.U0.

U, 1853, an\nremained the original part of the church\nunli\' September of last year, when it was\ntorn down to make room tor l lis new\ncburch as it stands today, well nigh com\npleted and ready for dedication. On Dec,\n10, 1853, tho organization was perfected\nRev. Hampson moderated the meetine\nand Win. Bailey acted as secretary. After\ndeciding the cburcb should belong to tbe\n"new scbooi," me following persons were\nreceived iulo membership i Hamilton\nStow, James Hilands, Herman Blum,\nBen amln May, m. McKIuley, Seldon\nT.

Mr. Stow aud Mr. Hilands were\nchoseu elders. The first communion ser-\nu ice was held Jan. 5, 1854, conducted by\nDr. Cralgbeau. During tne next eight\neen months tbe church was supplied by\nKevs. rsorrege ami union, in rioveiuber.\n1S55. Kev. u. w. Hammer was eugaged\nas regular pastor and served the church\nfur about two and one-naif years, giving\ntwo-thirds of bis time to the Tionesta\nchurch and the remainder to Pleasant-\nvllle. His pastorate was blessed of God.\nand a goodly number were received into\ntbe church on profession of luith. The\npastorate of Rev. Hammer closed March,\n1858, and was fallowed by a period of\nthree years during which time no records\nol tbe cburcu are avanaoie. in ism, nay.\nR. C. Allison became pastor and re\nmatned two years, after which, with the\nexception of Hie services of Rev. Andrew\nVirtue, giving out oue-tniru oi nis time,\nfrom 1801) to 1H71, the church was supplied\nonly irregularly by the Presbytery until\nJanuary, 1875. In 1875, Kev. Wm. Kill\nott was called to the pastorate for one-half\ntime. Owing to tne ravages ot tbe Civil\nwar and by many removals the cburch\nsuffered very materially, but with the\ncoming of Rev. Elliott the prospects be\ngan to brighten. \'1 here being no ruling\nelders at ihis time Mr. H. If. Stevenson,\nof Oil City, was invited to assist tbe pastor\nin tbe reception oi new members, aud on\nJan. 0. 1875. twelve mombers were re\nceived into ihe church, some of whom re\nmain until this time. In April Mr. G. G.\nButterfield was elected elder and per\nformed faithfully his duties until re\nmoved by death in 1890. Tbo pastorate\nor Mr. Kiiioti terminated in law. Kev.\nJames liickling then supplied the church\nfor a period, but was finally called to be\nIts pastor Aug. 22, 1881, and proved to be\nworker mat noeueiu not to be\nashamed," for uuder his pastorate the\nwork ot the church was wonderfully\nblessed.

The Pennsylvania Railroad provides this for the public.\nFor many months big all steel coaches, built like Dreadnaughts,\nhave been operated on all through trains. Their easy-riding quali\nties and steadiness of motion have been widely praised. The a 1\nsteel dining cars too bave distinct advantages over tbe wooden\nones. They are stronger and steadier, and tbe act of eating is\nmade more enjoyable by tbe smoother movement.\nThere are also some steel Pullman Cars Combined Parlor\nSmokers and Baggage in the service now. Travelers like them.\nThey have plenty of elbow room and they glide over tbe rails. Tbe\nSleeping Cars are coming. Some four hundred parlor and sleep\niog cars will be in use by Summer.\nThese steel coaches and cars are the strongest vehicles ever\nbuilt for passenger transportation. They are fire proof, break\nproof, and bend proof. Tbey represent tbe climax of safety aud the\nperfection of comfort in railroad travel.\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad has always been the leader in all\nmanner of improved equipment as well a9 in all methods of making\ntheir patrons more comfortable. This is why it is known and hon\nored as tbe Standard Railroad of America.\n\' TTTTTTTTTTTT VTTTTTTTTTTTTT\nSee Washington\nSPRINC VACATION EXCURSION\nPennsylvania Railroad\nFriday, March 25, 1910\n$11.00\nFrom Tionesta i\nStop over at Baltimore ami\nPliilmlelpliiii\nallowed on return trip if ticket is\ndeposited with Htatiou Ticket\nA Kent, affording opportunity ot\nViNitinx ATLANTIC CITY.\nTickets will be g od going on\nregular trains on date named and\nto return within eleven days, in\ncluding date of excursion.\nEASTER SUNDAY AT THE NATION\'S CAPITAL\nSimilar Excursion April 8\nFull Information regarding leaving time of trains may be obtained of\nTicket Agents.\nJ.R.WOOD GEO.
