RESIDENCE 1301 i\nn ? :\n%\nSTIRRING ADDRESS OF ROOSEVELT [\nTD RUSSIAN WAII COMMISSION;\nNEW YORK, July 7?Win the war,\ntreat every incitement to civil war as\ntreason of humanity; and bend your\nevery energy to the overthrow of the\nGerman armies, was the advice ol\nTheodore Roosevelt, give to Ambassa\nuor Boris A. Bakmsliefe and the other\nmembers of the Russian war commis\nsion in an address which he delivereu\nIn Carnegie hall last night on the oc\ncasion of New York City\'s oillcial we}\ncome to the commission. The meet\ning was held under the auspices of the\nAmerican Friends of New Russia, act\ning in conjunction with the mayor\'s\ncommittee of welcome, Mr. Roosevelt\nsaid:\n"I am sure that I express the feel\nings of my fellow countrymen when\nI say that it is a matter of heart felt\nrejocinlg among all the people of the\nUnited States to greet and to welcome\nthis deputation from the new Russia,\nthe great Russian democracy. As a\nnation we have for many years felt a\npeculiar sympathy with and admira\ntion for the mighty Slav people of\nthe forest and the steppe for the young\ngiant among nations which as yet has\nhalf developed its tremendous\nstrength.\nin me past aruent sympatny wttn\nand- hope for the Russian people In\nAmerica has had to struggle with a\nallocked disbelief in autocracy and\nwith the whole policy of reaction and\nobscurant ism.\n"We held as our ideal the hope that\nultimately the mighty Russian empire\nmight stand as lie re we at last try\nto stand, so that Jew and Catholic and\nProtestant might feel their conscience\nas free as the conscience of the ortho\ndox and a self governing Finland or\nthe Caucasus or Armenia enjoy within\nthe empire the liberty that New York\nand Texas enjoy within this union.\n"Therefore ,we hail you. men and\nwomen of the new Russia, with heart\nfelt rejoicing. Now at last we can\nwish all success to Russia without any\nmisgiving or mental reservations. Now\nwe feel that the mighty Slav republic\nlias biased the trail of freedom and J\nlias won in legitimate fashion the L\nright to stand in the forefront of the I"\nonward movement of mknkind. Now |\nwe have the right to expect that you D\nwill grant the men of other races and jji\nother creeds the rights to government ft\nintellectual and religious liberty which U\nyou so justly demand for yourselves. D\n"In congratulating you and earnest- |\nly wishing you Godspeed on the patl>;y\nof nationul greatness, I do not under- H\nestimate the grave dangers that rise\nbefore and beside you.\n"No liberty can be permanently se\ncure unless it rests on a foundation\nof order. No people can permanently\nescape control from without unless\nthey practice control from within, and j\ncivil strife within a nation invites and i\nultimately ensures aggression from\'\nsome other nation. Self-control is the |\nsurest safeguard against alien control\nIt is because we Americans so deeply\ndesire the permanent triumph of demo\ncracy in Russia that with all our\nhearts we hope for moderation in the\nuse of your victory.\n"All of us who love Russia are\nthankful beyond measure for the re-j"\nfusal of the Russian people to avenge\npast wrongs by the commission of\npresent wrongs; we honor them for\nthe steadfast turning away from that\ncourse of action which would stain the\nhands of liberty with blood. We most\nearnestly hope that what Russia has\nby during and courage achieved she\nwill now preserve by cool-headed wis- |.\nJ\ni\ndom, by moderation and by practical\nrecognition o fthe fact that liberty\nwithout order may prove an great a l\ncurse as order without liberty. And.\noh, niv frienda! Strive to aecure\nliberty in the world at large and there\nfore, treat na traitors to Russia and\nto mankind all men who do not insist\nupon your exerting every particle of\nyour great strength to secure complete\nvictory over Germany and her allies j\nand tools; and such victory can be\ncomplete only when German militar-1\nism is utterly shattered.\n"So much for the Itusaiana. Now ?\nfor ourselves. There ia absolutely no\nuse in our expressing sympathy for ;\nRussia unless we turn it into deeds.\nThis war is not going to be won by\nrhetoric; and speeches at public meet\nings are actually michievous unless\nthey bear fruit in action. The Russian\npublic will have the right to regard us;\na nation of shame unless we at once ,\nput forth all our strength to aid them. ;\n"The first and greatest need is to\nput the largest possible army of flglit- |\ning men and to keep that army con- I\nstantly growing in size and efficiency\nuntil Germany Is overthrown. This la ?\n>t the flrat importance, and unless we "\ndo this nothing else counts. Every [\nman who can render service in the ?\nlighting line should strive to get there. I\n"In addition, let every man and wo- J\nman who cannot go to the front do I\nnil that is po^-ible in other ways. Aid I\nthe Red Cross in it? work for all; und ^\ngive your special support to organiza- i\ntlona like the American ambulance in ^\nRussia; for the need of Russia in this ^\nmat\' r is more bitter than the need i\nr?f any other of the great powers. J\n"M:. Ambassador and your envoys J\nfrom Russia, men and women of the *\nnew Russia, we fervently hope for .\nevery success for your mighty and *\nwonderful nation. The thing of first .\nimportance is to win the war. Settle \\\nthe large lines of service and govern- \'\nmental policy, provisionally, at once, <\nhut leave all that can be left until |\nafter the war; treat every Incitement ?\nto civil war as treason to humanity;\nand bi nd your every energy at the mo\nment to the overthrow of the German\narmies."\nYes, We Do\nfob Work\nYou will find our\nprices satisfactory\nAlways at Your\nService for\nPrinting Needs!\nJ N\nI Is ther* something you\nI need In the follow\nI Ing Us it\nBirth Annnnncaraaata\nI WtddlnJ Slallonarp\nI Eavtlopt Incloauraa\nI Sal* Bllla\n?
