VOL. 31. NO. 1\nBrazilian Advice\nBy Prof. Isaac S. Moore,\n?2(i Ru a dos Capi\'aes.\nBahia, Brazil.\nBabia, Brazil. Dec. 30th., 1911.\n.^lartiusburg, W. Va , l\'ioneer Pie^s.\nMartinsburg, W. Va . U S. A.\nDear Editor:?I hope that. you and all\nhave bad a Merry Christmas. and 1\nwish you a bappy New War. Although\nI do not feel myself worthy to oomph\nmaerit you, >et rr-av I say that the deci\neion and exactness with which you Ufa It\nt with ihe Ulrich-Washington case. cet\ntainly attracts nay biphest edmtration,\nat lc.a6t from an individual standpoint\nJt proves that there are men, even in\nthe Negro lac? and in the great United\nStates of North America, who will not\nmince at the truth when it is clear to\nthem, and upon such a knowledge rt sts\nthe inspiration of the following peneia\n?Jtions, and long may such men live in all\ngen^i ations and races, an well as places.\n\' If any race needs or ever did nted tlna\nkind of tiue manliness. it i? the Ntpio\n, jace. For sadly is the Negro race the\nfoot bad of all races, so much so that\n?when ever a weakling can baiely\nsqueeze by. he does not hesitate in\nabandoning his identity with the Nt gio.\nami eetablicl )? wh h some other race\nThen to show ihat he has no sym\npathy with said race he mvatiably be\n\' comea more ty /ano*cai than any other\nrace or people to which he makes him- j\nraetf the ally, Thi6 ib lh? preutest curse"\nof the Negro race The greatest num\nber of the so-culled leaders only lead\nthem to the rnaikct that will give them\nthe most for the entire flock, and as\nthere are so many othirs on\'y coveting\ntheir chance to no the pame some day\nthat they -re afraid to spPhk lest, they\nmay spoil their own opportunity. Down\ngoes the poor race another notch, to dep\n? xedation. Do > ou notice this in the men\n?whom we would be glad to sdmire oth\nerwise? I will say mos*. conspicuously\nvin the two persona of Frederick Doug\n?laea and Hooker T. Washington, not.\nspeaking about VVlu. Hannibal Thomu* |\nof Everet Mass. It is only because\nihey ?o*r no rebuttfci*? frr>m tke op;*-" ^d\nrace, but I say thai Ne^ro<. s want t??\nlearn to su*p such fellows in the face,\nand pive a warning to all others. The\ntrouble is that Negroea are trying to\nbide from their very Helves to such a\ndegree ihat although seventy-five per\ncent of the worid h population are Ne\ngroes, it is only the uneducated and\nthose direct or itidijr-ctiy connected\n?with modern slavery who will allow\ntberoseivee to be called Negroes not\n-withstanding some of them could al\nmosi spit ink if they could liquify their\ncolor. Yet if cne should h^fpen t?j\ncsll bim aNepro, he jh highly indignant i\nand wiil demand immediate apology\n"You do nor need n o to remind *ou\nbow l?r. Washington refers to his IS e\ngrobood. He, like F ederick houtrla^s.\nopenly dedicate* h-s iutelligei ce to lus\nwhite blood, which is au insult not or ly\nto the mother and her race which bore\nhim. but to the God cf creation as\n\'though be con Id not instill intelligence\ninto a bl> ok m*n. This has gone to\n.\'Such an ex\'ent that men and women\ndare to upbraid Gf d their cieator for\ngiving them a bleok skin I ask you\nwhere is there a greater sinV Now 1\nam sure that you have seen ponie of\nthope remarks wh ch Mr. Mitchell has\nbed the giodnese to publish in his aide\nand worthy paper. The Richmond Piao\n? et If I desired to know what you\nthought of it, I would be worthy to be\ncallcd a man pleawer. While 1 do not\ngive a rap for the pleasure of men in\nthat pirticulsr, it is the riphts of men\nfor wh.ch I was working and for which\nI live. et 1 will give you some of my\nreasons for speaking against the much\nagitated question of a leader f r the\nrace I judge that vou are a man\nwho has paHsed those childish thoughts\n- of the masses and that sound truth will\nDot make an inharmonious jar upon\nyour nervea.\nThe truth ie, that there is not one man\nin bII Ametica who ie capable of lead \'\ning the N<-pro rsce successfully. I am J\nBpeabir.K from an educationol point of\nview, and I def* you even to ttutbfully\n.gainsay me. Here in my foundation\n\' for such bold aeerrtions. The educated\nNegro in or out of the United 8i??tes\n.knows too little about ibe actual condi\ntio dh of the race to assume <o dictate its\nnetds. He only knows what he has\n?seen and beaTd of certain districts.I\n\'This which he has h?ard, is tn moat\n- cases f/om white men who know evrn\nkea ubout the truest conditions of the\n? race. Again, it is not knowledge cf the\nrace alone which would quality one,\nbut an equal knowledge of other races,\nplaces, businesses and socinl conditions\nof each comparatively. There are not\nbooks written that give the definite con\nditions of the Nt\'gro race to (lay. There\nJittle or no correspondence carried\non internalioLolly by the Negroes. The\neducated Negro >s r?ot ?n extensive\ntraveler, and when he travels he is s ? ;\nhigh that he never really learns or?v\nthing about the conditions of his race ?\nwhere he travel*. It i<* all told to him !\nby others, and bis money is really so j\n?mall. and his time eo short that how\never interested he is. he cannot linger j\nm one place. Piease tell me where is i\nth<> man who has even tried to acquaint j\nbin.self with the true conditions of the\nNegro race to any great extent but the\non" who whs in the service of white !\nmen and really out of swn|athy with j\nb;a uubj-ctV Without this knowledge\nno one can say just what i* goi>d and\nwhat is ba?i for the Negro t; and\nI dare say that I>r. Wat-hint ton\'s know\nledge is about as omp\'o an any other\ncoloied man\'s knowledge in America.\nDoubtless you couH probably teach him\nmuch about th-ngs which come daiiy\nunder >our observation. The trouble\nis that he has no time to consult with\nyou or any other poor man, yet he must\ndic\'ate your rights as a citizen. E\\tn\nif be really knew something which\nJ would save you from much embarrasa\n; moot he does not dare to t*ll > ou for\n; fenr that be will loose some personal\nI favo:S willi some of bis white fiiend^.\n1 In his owr? admission about Rooeevelt\nand the colored sold ie? s, \\ ou see be bad\nbeen the main instrument in disarming\nyou ki the polls and now bis friend\n1 and ally wan to take tbe civil aims away\nand nothing could he do. and lens did\nb^ care. then. Iju- he will learn to care\n[ if he lives much longer.\nIf isalmns\' usele-sto say anything\nabout the much honor* d Prof. Dnlbua,\nafter the leuer which lie published l;c-t\nyear, but I suppose too,that be has bad\nreasons to i ell.-ot more upon I lie impor\ntance of such utterances, and so a ?s\non down tin- line There are too many\nmem a< d ignorant dtcia\'ois in the col\noie-t race, and not enough real men\nwho will fe^k to know how ?o b;rld it\nnp. If you applaud onrr a<- a public\nbanquet In* is out ? he r ex.\' day aw a dic\ntator, and what does he know fot God\'s\ns.tke? \'J his does i.ot end the trouble;\nhe also Hvks to make money at the\nexpense of his admirers, yet he has\nreally done nothing. This is a thing to\nbe duploied You evidently want to\nknow then what remedy wonld I give\ntor fcll t h s? Well- 1 rwjmtfd f-ay, there\nis no\'bine so good as regular confer\neuces jo Vj\'nur i?wf*?t,4*a!e districts whei e\nall of the people can be heard. After\nward hold quarterly sessions wheie\nonly your best material wiil b^ dele\ngale* and then annual meetings wher?\nthe ie?l b are* s? nr to represent you. J\nY?u mall no mi-\'a!-e in choosing them j\nbecause \'hey woik themselves up from i\nihe very lowest depreen, and by all j\nuiiiti.B let the* press be theie always to j\ntell the public ifaiiy funny tracks ar^ J\no\'wyeo. In this wav you iedly mal e i\n>our own representatives and give them I\nconfidence and sftength by practice and\nassociation with their own. Aiain,\nyou should begin at once to fstablisb\nnafoi al and international news corie?\npoiidence bureau for the education of\nNegroes to their advantage in every\npast ot the woild. By ibis means you\nwould know \\vhar yon are really wi.it h\nat honie Vou see today U at Negroes\nar?- not. consider! d when any gnat or\nreai business is d >ne in the financial,\npolitica\' or commercial world. And\nwin? You can answer that question\nprobably tetter than I >egio?*s are\nconsidered much as chattels even now,\nmid if there are not nomo immediate\ns ep> taken he will (ind that he is out\nof?h? qu?stion altogether. Now the\nfirst and most importy-t thing that the\nforemost, men oujtht to do, is to stop\naskmg pittacce^s from other races to\nbuild np |Ji" Negro race In vulgar\nlanguage, quit pass ng ttie hat" to the\nwhite man. Tlrs makes a coward of\nany race, or person. You must really\nlook to build the race up to a self sup\nporting i a*is. and when you men can\ntruly ui deist and that you are not to\nhave more than the race can give, you\nwill levin to think of augmenting the\ncapacity of the race to give more. That\nme ns to seek v ays and means for the\nrace to have more to g:ye It can only\nget, an appreciable amount of that\nwhich is by entenng the fie\'d of crn\nmerce. It is after all, the commercial\nmen who are the real kings of the\nworld, and until tlie Negro can make\nbis name read up n these pages he is a\nback t*umber Now there is another\nthought which I wish to bring to your j\nmind, and that is, how you should j\nmake high ranking rnditaiy officers j\namong the American Negroes, which j\nwill add no little importance to the\nrace in America. Since Annapolis and\nWesf Point have refused you, you\nf-hould Fetid your children at once to j\nthe military schools of other countries,\nand when Amenct finds that, you are ;\ndoif g this, you\'ll find even the- doors of\nher academies opening to you I ?ell\nyou that you m ?y say all you will, but\ncowaidice never won a battle. A brave\nheart also ptoduces mucn. and the\nowner works in many wa^s. I am *\nflim believer in s.ra>egy, but not in\ncunning; in science, but not in scandal.\n1 don\'t bt-lieve in yielding in a good\ncause.

The crcat value of barnyard manure\nVs a farm resource is only realized by\nthe farmi\'r:; who are getting the larg\nest production of farm < rops from\ntheir soil, i am glad to say thai there\nAire on!}\' a very f*;w farmers of the\npresent, day who begrudgo tin* time\nAnd 1110;\'m y required to remove it from\naround the barn. I have known farm\ners who considered the accumulation\n?of manure in and around the barn as\nan unavoidable nuisance in handling\nllvo stock and removed it only for the\nreason that it must be gotten out of\n<the way, and so hauled it to the near\nest field, dumping it into a few piles.\n"When the time came to plow the field\nthey then found it necessary to scat\nter the manure in ord\'-r to plow the\nground. Manure after standing in\n?mall piles out in a field will have had\nmost of the soluble plant food leeched\nout on a very small area of ground\n"while the remainder that is scattered\n"will consist only of the coarser mate\nrial, with very little soluble plant food\n1n if.\nT lie re are several conditions that\nmight. b<i mentioned as affecting the\nvalue of farm manure, sue i as the\nmethod of handling and preserving ma\nnure, the kind and amount of bedding\nused, the kind of animals and their\nage, and the kind of food furnished the\nanimal.\nStable manure is better than barn\nyard manure because it contains all\nthe solid and liquid portions. All\nmanure should he kept under a shed\nor other suitable cover to protect it\nfrom the rain and the sun, and sufli\n-jrient bedding should be used to ah\nsorb :t 11 tlie liquid portion. Tho liquid\npart of tho manure contains a great\ndeal of the nitrogen. which, if not ab\nsorbed, is lost; so that when this por\ntion is ;i 11 c> ??. < <! tvj go to waste, the\nvalue of the manure ia greatly dimin\nished. The manure of young animals\nis not as rich as that, from mature an\nimals. Manure from sheep and poul\ntry is richer th in the manure from\nhorses, cows and swine. Animals fed\nhighly nitrogenous feeds, such as cot\nton seed meal and linseed meal, pro\nduce a more valuable manure than an\nimals fed coarser feeds.\n]f manure is not well taken ca.ro of,\na larg" portion of the most valuable\nplant food is lost, and this may be pre\nvent! (1 to a large extent by adding acid\nphosphate t-o it, using about f?U pounds\nto a ton of manure or applying one\npound every morning in the stall, after\nwhich tho stall is well bedded.\nWht-n the value of a ton of manure\nis determined, we find in it about 10\npounds of nitrogen, F> pounds of phos\nphoric acid and 10 pounds of potash,\nbeing worth $2.i!f> a ton, considering\nth\'.* nitrogen worth 1", cents per\npound and the phosphoric acid and\npotash each five cents per pound. Ex\nperiments show ihat the average value\nof increase of crop produced by one\nton of fresh manure is from $-.75 to\n$3.50. Therefore, if a farmer will take\nthe time of multiplying the number of\ntons of fresh manure that is made on\nhis farm every year by $.1 he will un\nj derstand the value of manure as a\ni farm resource. I. S. COOJ\', JR.,\nCollege of Agriculture, West Vir\n! giiila University.\nTHE Y. M. C. A. OF WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY.\nThe accompanying picturc is a flash\nlight, taken of one of (lie regular week\nly ?nen\'s meetings of the University\nY. M. C. A. President Hodges was the\nspeaker at tins meeting. The meet\nings are held \';ii every Friday evening,\nand the speakers arc prominr at men,\nof the university or elsewhere. A\n:large crowd attends these religious\nmeetings of the mid-week, at which\nsubjects of vital interest, to earnest\ncollege men are informally discussed.\nThe association has shown evidence\nthis year of being very much alive.\nNot only has it held, or ient its aid to\nseveral social events in the school\n?during the year, and organized a fast\nbasket ball team. In more serious\nmatters as well, it has shown iise\'.f\nr nidy to lend a helping hand. Many\n{.oople who are interested in the uni\nversity do net know that the Marilla\nruni.jy-sc.hcol ir- organized under the\nsupervision of he Young Men\'s Chris\ntian Association, or that it is respon\nslble also for fnrni liing two speakers\nevery second week for an evening\nmeeting In that place on Sunday cv. ?\nning. Members of the association have\nalso conducted meetings at the Moncn\n.gallan county home, where religious\nexercises have been held for the first\ntime in several years.\nGospel teams composed of associa\ntion members are planning several\n?trips to small outlying towns, access!\ni bio from Morgantown. The meetings\n\' aro generally hold on three successive\nflays, Friday, Saturday and Sunday,\nI a\'id iho teams aro eo nposed of two or\nthroe speakers and a singer. Only one\nj such series has boon so far hold since\nChristinas, hut. others aro being plan\nned. That held was at Stewartstown,\nand was very successful.\nAnother branch of the Association\'s\nactivities which will readily commend\nitself to every patriotic American is\nthe work which they have started\namong the foreigners of Morgantown\'s\nmanufacturing suburb of Sabraton.\nJ They aro teaching the immigrants of\ntho shops and factories to speak and\nwrite correctly the. tongue of their\nadopted country. The Roberts system\nof instruction is used. The work has\nonly !r toly been organized, but is pro\ngressing nicely, and is one which will\nhe < f obvious benefit not only to Mor\ngantown, bat to the country iu gen\nj eral.\nj The V. M. C. A. is not an organiza\ntion which spends its time chiefly in\nblowing its own hern, and it is respon\nj siblc for many goee things for which\nthe* general pubiic, with casual obser\nvation, does not give it credit. But\nthose who are familiar with its work\nknow that it is a real force in the uni\n. vers\' y, and that all its varied activi\nties aro directed toward a common\npurpose of helping the student body\nand the world.\nHEAD THE I\'l JNhER Pi\'.KSf?, $1.00 A.
