OF TROUBLE\nNew Delhi, India — Prime Min\nister Malan’s Nationalist regiment\nin the union of South Africa was\nblamed here Sunday for the\nbloody racial wardare between\nZulu and Indian citizens of the\nunion. The rioting broke out in\nI Durban, South Africa Thursday\ni after what appeared to be a\nminor incident.\nA government official described\nthe riots as the “inevitable re\nsult of racial hatred created by\nthe present South African govern\nment.” Many people believe that\nthe Dutch-Boer regime in South\nAfrica inspired, and encouraged\nthe rioting between the two\ngroups, who long have been at\nodds with each other. The idea)\nbehild the agiation is that the\nDutch would benefit if the In\ndians — who are outsmarting\nthe Dutch in trade and are grow\ning wealthy — were deported.\nThe uprising broke out when\nnatives claimed an Indian had\nassaulted a young native boy. Im\nmediately, a series of disorganiz\ned attacks on the Indians broken\nout. By Sunday, the warfare had\nspread to as far as Johannes\nburg, largest city in South Africa,\n310 miles northwest of Durban.\nFirst count of bodies by Dunbar\npolice listed 85 dead and 870 In\ndians and Sulus injured.\nSignificaltly enough none of\nthe 120,000 white population had\nbeen molested in the five days of\nfighting. However, it was report\ned that 25,000 Durban Indians\nhad fled their homes.\nLast September a similar de\nmonstration broke in Capetown\nwhen 3,000 natives demonstrated\nagainst the segregation of whites |\nand non whites on suburban rail\nway lines. There is segregation 1\non trains throughout the union, j\nand natives are denied the right 1\nto vote in parliamentary elections. 1\nIndians have about the same I\nstanding as natives.\nProud Warriors\nThe Zulus, in Durban and Nat\nal province, are remnants of a,\nproud warrior people who a few\ngenerations back humbled Brit\nish arms in a series of defeat.\nThey do not like Indians and-j\nthe antipathy is mutual. The feel- j\ning is fortered by the example of 1\nwhite people who fear an en\ncroachment of “cookies” and seek\nnot only their complete segrega\ntion but their repatriation to\nIndian.\nThe policy of the Nationalist\ngovernment is complete segrega\ntion of all natives nad elimina\ntion of any representation for\nAfricans and Indians in the legis\nlatures. The government has been\nseeking to repatriate the 285,500\nIndianians back to India, but has\nnot been able to figure out a way1\nto do it.\nLast year, Prime Minister Ja\nwahariah Nehru of India put the j\ncase of the Indian minority in\nSouth Africa before the UN. The\nUN exolved a plan for a joint\nconference with the two nations i\nto settle difference but South Af- j\nrica rejected the plan last Aug\nust.\nThe white population of South\nAfrica totals 2,400,000, comparied j\nwith 8,000,000 natives.

Farish St\nJackson, Mississippi', "Discrimination In\nWashington, D. C.\nBy REV. WILLIAM C. KEENAN\n— A blistering report on segregation\nin Washington, D. C. has been re\nleased bv the National Committee\non Segregation in the Nation’s Cap\nitol whose members'P\\ includes such,\nprominent names as /Mr. James B.\nCarey, Judge Meier Steinbrick. Mr.\nWalter P. Reuther, and Mr. Walter\nWhite. Chairman is Dr. George N.\nShuster, President of Hunter Col\nlege.\nThe Committee reports that Neg\nroes in Washington, D. C. are crowd\ned into the city’s slums. They com\npose 70 pe7 cent of Washington’s\nslum residents although they num\nber but 30 per cent of its popula\ntion.\nAs you might expect, bad living\nconditions breed bad health con\nditions. 9 per cent of the deaths\nfrom tuberculosis in the Capitol are\namong Negroes.\nJob discrimination keeps Washing\nton’s Negro population poor, it hav\ning been established by the Com\nmittee that, apart from menial work,\njob opportunities are for the most\npart closed to them.\nThe Federal Government itself\nbears some of the responsibility for\nthis deplorable state of affairs. For,\nin spite of presidential executive\norders against job discrimination,\nthe Committee cites the State and\nJustice Departments, the Federal\nReserve Board, the Federal Trade\nCommission, and the Bureau of the\nBudget as agencies which exculde\nNegroes from all jobs except those\nwhich white people refuse to take.\nThis is a glaring and shocking\npractice. It disregards American\nprinciples. It is unjust. It doesn’t,\nbelong in this country. It is con\ntrary to the law of God.\nMonsignor Raymond J. Campion\nof St. Peter Claver Church, Brook\nlyn, New York, once stated the case\nthis way:\n“According to the natural moral\nlaw every human person precisely\nbecause he is a human person, en\njoys the right, regardless of race\nor color, to a recognition of his\nequal dignity as a human person\nwrith all other men . . .\n“To deny to any group its es\nsential rights as human beings is\nto break the natural lawr. Break\ning the natural lawr is a crime. It\nis a serious sin against God and\nnature. It calls for condign punish\nment. No amount of sophistic ra\ntionalization can avoid or conceal\nthis fact.’’\nWe agree with that. Discrimina\ntion against anyone is a flagrant vio\nlation of the law of God regarding\nthe dignity of every man’s human\nnature. By every standard of Ameri\ncanism, it is unpatriotic and it it\nmust be stopped.\nBut, while we are justly critical\nof discriminatory practices in Wash\nington, each of us may wrell make it\nhis personal business to look into\nhis own community’s back yard and\nsee what goes on there — with a\nview, of course, to taking whatever\naction is necessary to insure and\nprotect the personal rights of ffee\nAmericans. I\ni\nWISE SAYINGS\nWhere love is, God is also.\nThe essence of human tragedy is\nin lonliness, not in conflict.\nBear it if you can — and if you\ncan you must shoulder the sky my\nlad and drink your ale.\nMary Strong Talks\nBROTHERHOOD\nToday is a new day — the high- i\nway to tomorrow. Yesterday, ever\ndreamed of the big, widening hori\nzon that is now before us — yester\nday, we were behind the sun rise\nThere are widen hearted old who\nnever believed they could approach)\nwithout cholor so near to men dif\nfering race, color, religion, etc-, but\nso it is — the dawm breaking —\nthe new days comes — and —\n“Yesterday’s paradox is tomorrow’s\ntruth.” i\nBeauty Itints\nBy Nine Temple\nYOUR EXPRESSION\nIf you want to look your best,\nachieve social distinction, and, win\nfriendship and love, remember this:\nThere is something more import\nant than your apparel, something\nbeyond the splendor of dress; some\nthing that goes out beyond your\nphysical coverings; it is your ex\npression. So, be wrise, and never for\nget to wear your most pleasing face\nwhen you go to conquest. The ex\npression goes further than the eye,\nit penetrates to the heart of the\nobserver.

H. Humphrey dropped\nchargess against Roderick Clifton, an\nauto salesman, whose trial on the\nsame charge was supposed to fol\nlow Howell’s.\nWidow Collapses\nThe seven-hour trial was high,\nlighted by the collapse of Malard's\nwidow and the calling of two jurors\n‘o the stand in behalf of the defense.\nAfter Howell was freed, Judge\nmotion on behalf of Clifton. The mo\ntion, in effect, drops further action\nagainst the second defendant whose\ntrial was sscheduled to follow How\nell’s.\nDefense attorneys for Clifton ob\njected to the motion to drop action\nbrought bty Solictor General W.

JThey asked that Clifton\nbe summarily declared not guilty.\n‘Was Home In Bed’\nHowell, who was dramatically\nidentified Tuesday morning bv the\nvictim’s wddow as a member of the\nhooded murder gang, said in an un\nsworn statement that he was inno\ncent of the crime, that he “wras\nborne in bed at the time of the\ncrime,” and that he did not own a\ntun.

McDuffie, one of the\nGeorgia l|ureau of Investigation,\ntestified that Mallard’s widow was\nquestioned several hours before she\nmentioned Howell’s presence in the\nrobed mob.\nThe opening session wTas marked\nby the collaps of the slain man’s\nwidow, after she dramatically point\ned out Howell as a member of the\nhooded and robed gang.\nWhen she returned to the crowded\nToombs county superior courtroom,\nthe defense attempted to break down\nher story that 20 men were in the\ngang. They recalled her statements\nduring the investiation that the gang\nconsisted of “eight to 10 men*’.\nA Cleveland manufacturer, Joseph\nM. Goldwasser, who entered the case\nfor what he called “humantarian”\nreasons, was kept out of the court\nroom throughout the morning. The\ndefense subpeonaed him as a witness\nMrs. Mallard’s four year old child,\njust before the trial opened.\nTwo teen-aged cousins of the wi\ndow supported her testimony, say\ning that 20 men were in the crowd\nthat surrounded the Mallard car on\nNov. 20. William Carter, 19, and\nAugeline Carter, 13, said they huddl\ned in the back seat and were unable\ncrowd.\nThe trial was interrupted earlier\nwhen the widow collasped and be\ngan screaming hysterically after\ndescribing the mudrr scene,\nThe court was recessed while\nrelatives removed the woman from\nthe court room.\n% Positively Identified\nJust a few minutes before, she\npointed out Howell and said she\n“positively identified’’ him as being\na member of the murder gang.\nIt was when she was describing\nthe scene just after the slaying,\nthat she collasped. She told of going\naround the car to the side where\nher husband had fallen out. She\nsaid: “Blood was gushing out of\nhis mouth and nose.”\nThe widow was the first witness\nafter a jury had been picked in 20\nminutes in the widely publicized\ncase.\nShe told how she and her husband,\na casket salesman, and two teen\naged cousins ha dattended a party\nNew York City — It was with\nregret that we watched Lena Horne\nat Radio City Music Hall in her\nlatest film “Words and Music” in\ntechnicolor. The girl has every\nthing. Charm, glamour — such na\ntural good looks. And even a voice.\nBut Lena can’t dance. That two\nstep she attempted when singing.\n“The Lady Is A Tramp” proved it.\nThe song was great. The words\nand music both fitted Lena like a\nglove. And her gown, white inlaid\nwith fuschia ruffles, simple but\nunique, adorned Lena like the fresh\nblossoms of spring. We couldn’t help\nbut feel proud when the audience\naround us, mostly businessmen from\nthe Rockefeller section, gasped with\ndelight when the name of “Miss Le\nna Horne was grandly announced.\nNow, if Lena could only dance —\nshe’d be a well rounded musical\nstar. For every top biller in “Word:\nand Music” could kick up her\nheels prettily. Namely, June Ally\nson, Ann Southern, Cyd Charisse\nand Judy Garland. In fact, Lena\nwas the only one in skirts who\ndidn’t show above the ankles, be\nsides the girl who played the se\ndate Mrs. Dick Rodgers, wife of\nthe famous composer.\nIt’s a known fact that Lena has\ntaken dancing lessons from many\nprominent teachers both in Holly\nwood and in New' York. She was\nalso a former chorus girl, getting\nher start at the Cotton Club here.\nBut MGM has never allowed her\nskirts to go up or to have her\nlegs photographed. For the fact re\nmains, Lena not only hasn’t the tal\nent for dancing, she hasn’t the gift\nof gorgeous gams. But she can still\nstop a show by just sitting on the\nsofa and looking pretty. She doesn’t\neven have to walk — and certainly\nnot dance! Who looks at leg, any\nway with a face like hers? ? ?\nHoward University Students Receive Philip Morris Prizes\nX ^ ~ ~ ' 1\n--— ..\nAT the recent Fellowship Dance, Howard University students receive the radios and television sets awarded\ntheir fraternities and sororities by Philip Morris ft Co. for winning the Campus' scorecasting contests\n™ost accurate group score predictions during the football season.

No co-operation was re\nceived and many of the patrons are\nnow sending their children to Fargo,\nPine Bluff and Stuttgart for hibh\n'school at an unnecessary expense.\nIncluded among the signers of the\npetition filed with the school board\nwas the former chairman, S.

He said\nphases of this observance pro\nmote better diets, better homes,\nscreening of windows and doors,\nconstruction of sanitary toilets,\nand destruction of the breeding\nplaces of rate, flies and mosqui\ntoes.\nOur extension agents encour\nage 4-H club boys and girls to\ntake part in those and other\nhealth improvement activities,”\nDr. Shinn continued. “One of H’s\nin 4-H stands for Health.
