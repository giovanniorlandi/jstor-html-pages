The service is only tri\nweekly and run on such an irregular\nschedule that the merchants hardly\nknow exactly when they may ex\npect to receive or to deliver ship\nments. Complaints of the service\nhave grown so general that the rail\nroad and transportation committee\nof the Business Men\'s Club has\nthus early undertaken to see if the\nrailroad cannot be induced to give\nour merchants and the other com\nmunities on the main line between\nhere and Harlingen a square deal.\nThe matter has been explained to\nGeneral Manager Rodgers of the\nrailroad company by the committee\nin the following letter, which was\nsent today:\nC. B. Rodgers,\nVice Pres. & Gen. Manager, St. L.,\nB. & M., Ry.,\nKingsville, Texas.\nDear Sir: There has been almost\nuniversal complaint by the mercn\nants .oi Brownsvi as to ...e ir\nregularity of freight service out\nfrom Brownsville and their conse\nquent inability to ente rinto con\ntract with customers alorg the main\nand branch line of the St. L., B. & M.\nRy., for the delivery of freight at\nany given time. By this we mean\nat any time within reason, that is,\nconsidering the distance. We under\nstand that transportation companies\nreceive goods subject to delay, but\nwhat we are striving for is to have\nsome definite arrangement made so\nthat we can tell customers either on\nthe branch line or on the main line\nbetween Harlingen and Brownsville\nwhen they may expect to receive\ngoods under favorable conditions.\nWe understand this matter has\nbeen called to your attention, but\nfor fear that it has not and with a\nsincere desire to work harmoniously\nwith you, rather than to resort to the\ncommission we now ask for some\nassurance of what we might expect\nin the future.\nWe ask that a daily freight be run\nfrom Brownsville to Sam Fordyce or\nout of Brownsville daily to connect\nwith the Harlingen and Sam For\ndyce freight, which we understand\nis run daily between these two\npoints. However, if this should be\nimpractical and not remunerative,\nthat some provision should be made\nfor our freight to Olmito, San Be\nnito, Harlingen and branch line sta\ntions to be moved by the passenger\ntrain.\nFeeling sure that you will take\ninto consideration the vital import\nance of this question to the Browns,\nville interests, and also the fact that\nBrownsville contributes more rev\nenue in freight receipts to vhe St.\nL., B. & M. Ry than any station on\nthe line, we teel sure that you will\nact favorably in the matter.\n(Signed)\nW H.

R. Allen, a resident of\nthe literary center of the Middle\nWest who arrived last night. "When\n1 stepped aboard the train," he con\ntinued, "Indianapolis was up against\na raging blizzard with the mercury\ndown near the zero mark. It feels\nsomewhat more comfortable down\nhere."\nMr. Allen is a recent investor in\nRio Grande Valley land. About two\nmoniiis ago, with two associates, Wm.\nShoemaker, of Indianapolis, and F.\nE. Matthews, of Bloomington, 111.,\nhe bought 550 acres just east of the\nChicago Gardens on the Indiana Co\noperative Canal. The entire tract\nwill be planted in Sugar cane, about\n180 acres this season and the re\nmainder next season. A contract for\nclearing the land was let soon after\nit was bought and SO acres are ready\nfor the plow now.\nMr. Allen, who is a manufactu\nrer of bicycles and steam appliances,\nexpects to remain in Brownsville un\ntil the planting is well under way,\nand hopes to spend a good part of\nhis time here in the future.\nAnother tract on the Indiana Ca\nnal now being cleared up for plant\ning in sugar-cane is that recently\nbought by W. N. Pickers and associ\nates, also of Indianapolis. This ad\njoins the Brulay plantation and con\ntains 426 acres. One hundred acres\nhave been cleared and are being\nWashington, Dec. 10. A 5500,\n000,000 bond issue, or an annual\nCongressional appropriation of 550,\n000,000 for the improvement of the\nwaterways of the country, is the de\nmand of the Sixtli National Rivers\n. and Harbors Congress which has\nbeen in session here the past two\ndays.\nThis session of the congress has\nemphasized the demand of almost\nthe entire country for the develop\nment of the waterways for naviga\ntion purposes.\nThe National Rivers and Harbors\nCongress stands for the general ap\npropriation of fifty millions a year\nfor the internal development of the\nrivers, harbors and canals of the\nUnited States, to be distributed on\nthe various projects which have the\napproval of the engineer corps of\nthe army. Should current revenues\nbe insufficient to make such an ap\npropriation possible then the Con.\ngress urges the authorization of five\nhundred millions of waterway bonds\nat a low rate of interest, with the\nsame conditions surrounding these\nbonds as surround the Panama ca\nnal bonds, said bonds, however, are\nnot to be issued unless current reven\nues prove inadequate to carry out\nsuch a policy. It is not contemplat\ned that these bonds shall be issued\nat any time but only as the needs\nof waterway improvements make\ntheir issuance impertive.\nThe National Rivers and Harbors\nCongress was founded in Baltimore\nin October, 1901, at which some six\nhundred delegates were present. At\nthe last convention held in the city\nof Washington last December nearly\nthirty-five hundred delegates were\npresent.\nCommercial Travelers Speak.\nRepresenting the United Commer\ncial Travelers of America, W. A.\nJohnson spoke today, expressing\nhearty support of the movement for\nwaterways development. Mr. John\nson said in part:\n"We believe that these natural\narteries of commerce, our great riv\ners, should be made and kept nav.\nigable for large vessels by the gov\nernment, and that this work should\nbe done upon a bond issue large en\nough to insure its thoroughness. We\nbelieve that no other expenditure\nof the people\'s money would be so\nuniversally popular and satisfac\ntory because none other could be\nso universally beneficent.\n"There are a half million or more\ncommercial travelers in this country.\nThey constitute the greatest civiliz\ning agency of this or any other age.\nThese men believe that nature\'s\nhighways of commerce the rivers\nand lakes of the land if utilized as\nthey should be, and. would open up\nnew and greater fields of enterprise\nfor our rapidly growing population.\n"It has been said that the pro\ngress of nations can be measured by\nthe extent and perfection of their\nmeans of transportation. By this\nstandard, how do we measure up?\nSurely in this gVeat land of our, so\nrich in every element of material\nwealth, with unbounded possibilities\nof commercial! progress, we should\nattain and retain commercial supre\nmacy of all thq nations of the earth."\nHERALD WANT ADS\nFor Sale.\nFOR SALE First class team Mis\nsouri mules, wagon and harness, for\n5450.
