Man\npossesses today as never before the technical knowledge\nnecessary for the development of a life of supreme rich\nness, beauty, and happiness; yet, never has the world\nfaced a future holding greater possibilities of disaster\nthan it does today. We have fought two major wars and\nare at present involved in a minor one to end war; and,\nin spite of such, the threat of global war—more terrible,\nmore devastating and inhuman than anything we have\nyet experienced—shrouds our world. The present charac\nter of international relations and warfare give us cause\nto be concerned tor the very survival of civilization. Our\nworld is shattered, uneasy and troubled.\nWe are living in a society in which distrust of oth\ners, be they single individuals or groups, principalities\nor nations, is the criteria by which we regulate all of our\nsocial actions.\nSecondly, we are living in a world of pessimism and\noptimism side by side; the pessimism resides, or is as\nsociated with the achievements of the elders of our day;\nwhereas, the optimism is associated with the hope we\nhave in the youth of this age. They are the ones of to\nday who possess the potentialities of leadership we need\nto rescure us from this universal social delima.\nH. G. Wells said some years ago that this age was\ncharacterized by being a race between education and\ncatastrophe. Figures show to date that the world has\nalready shed more blood in the past one-half century\nthan in all previous history. Such is the age in which\nwe now live, the likeness of which has never been equal\ned.\nThis is an epoch of atomic fission, bio-bacteriological\nresearch of phenomenal import, chemical synthesis and\na multiplicity of other technological advances as in the\nrealm of speed; no part of the earth today is more than\ntwelve hours distance in travel. Rockets and radar\nguided missies are now sent around the world in two\nhours.\nThe destruction caused by the first atom bomb\nseveral years ago brought to all of humanity an amaze\nment of deep concern, yet within less than a ten year\nperiod we have developed a hydrogen-helium bomb which\ndwarfs the possible destructive potentialities of the first\natom bomb. We are told now, that if three of these mas\nter bombs were dropped at stragetic places in the Uni\nted States all of our industrial power would be destroyed\nand the loss of human life would be appauling.\nThe new biological warfare is as devastating or\neven more so than the atom or hydrogen-helium bombs.\nThe possibility of destroying* cities over night by drop\nping a vial of germs makes one wonder just what and\nhow should man redirect his destiny.\nThe writer of this article sees possibility of bright\nfuture for man through education of youth to the true\nnature of our age. It should be pointed out to them the\nnew role the home, the school, community and nations\nshould perform in carrying out their duties. They should\nbe made aware that these institutions will need to set\nup a revised code of social ethics based On human rela\ntionships that has due regard for human personality.\nYouth will have to develop such personalities as will re\ngard every individual as being •sacred and of individual\nworth to himself and others alike. We as teachers, will\nhave to give youth direction into experiences, direct\nand indirect, which will cultivate the basic character\ntraits pertinant to the formation of the good society\nwherein hunger, deprivation and destress will be banish\ned from the earth.\nYouth should be encouraged more than ever before\nto strive diligently to gain the necessary experiences in\nthe natural sciences and arts so as to acquire proficiency\nin their specific vocations to better their livelihood.\nSeneca, a philosopher once said:\n“Our forefathers have accomplished much;\nThey have finished nothing.”\nAnd for a clarification of Seneca’s statement: Life’s\nepic is always a serial story, continued in the next chap\nter. It is the Divine privilege of the youth of this gen\neration to write the next one. We hope it will be better.\nBy—James W.

Communism of\nfers nothing to Negroes and the\nUnited States offers everything.”\nThe plight of Miss Horne, and\n1 other Negroes, especially artists,\nj is a tragic one. During the thir\nties, when the country was trying\nto dig itself out of the depression,\nthe Communists were working |\nboth sides of the fence. They\nproved themselves smart operators.\nNot only did the Communistsj\nopen the way for Negro artists j\nto get employment, but they pro\nvided other means for giving them j\nrecognition—a thing everybody;\ndesires. In those days, it was\nsmart to be “liberal” or “progress\nive,” and many individuals with\nno more interest in Communism,\nas such, than a rabbit, inadvert\ni ently found tfiemselves in the fold.\n| Some of them knew what they\n| were doing, but they felt they\n| needed the contacts to advance\n; their own ends. This applied also\n| to politics.\nCommenting further, Miss Horne\ni said, “The main thing for Negroes\nto do is fight actively against\nthe Commies, not passively. That’s\nwhat I intend to do, from now\non.”\nIt appears, now, that the wheel\nhas made a complete turn. It is\nno longer either popular or safe,\nnor is it profitable to be identi\nfied with the Communists or their\nfronts. Those who were so in\nvolved are running out—and fast.\nLOU SWARZ\nJOTTINGS\nNew York, City (GLOBAL)—\nThis week friends are deeply\nthinking over the passing of one\nof the BERRY Brothers who had\ndanced his way to fame along with\nhis brother—It was a shock to all,\nsince the young dancer was enjoy\ning health the evening before.\nNCNW in the limelight again\nwith the Founder, Dr. Mary Mc\nLeod Bethune having received a\nCitation from the Griffith Music\nFoundation in Newark, New Jer\nsey the latter part of the month’s\nfirst week . . .

If we don’t help\nNehur’s government to meet the\ngreat problem of a better standard\nof living in his country, they well\ndecide we don’t care about the\npeople of Asia and will be easy\nprey to Communist propaganda.”\n“India,” warned Dr. Johnson, “is\nthe one major portion ol the earth\nwhich has not taken sides in any\nfinal way; if it should go Com\nmunist, more than half of the world\nwould be aligned with a way of\nlife in most ways contrary to our\nown.”\n“The notion that India is in\nfundamental sense the enemy of\nthe United States is the most pre\nposterous conception that could\npossibly enter our minds.”\nNo people anywhere, he con\ntinued, are better prepared to be\nfriendly to the U. S. by their his\ntory, their institutions and their\nleadership. The Indian constitution\nhe pointed out, is in many respects\nmodeled after the Amc ican one.\nTo keep from alienating India,\nhe declared, the U. S. must re\nspect its necessarily neutral posi\ntion in the military and political\nsense - its extreme vulnerability to\nRussian attack, its inability to raise\na modern army because of national\npoverty, and its long-time friend\nship for the Chinese people, which\nit cannot afford to discard be\ncause of a change in government.\n-o\nNegro Teachers...\n(Continued from Page One)\nciation of Teachers in Public\nSchools, but which last year chang\ned its name to the Mississippi\nTeachers Association, has through\nthe years concerned itself with\nproblems such as length of school\nterms, poor facilities, transporta\ntion of children, curricula, and other\nmatters that are the proper con\ncern of the parents and citizens,\nwhile giving little are no attention\nto such matter directly bearing on\nthe welfare of the teachers, such\nas salaries, tenure, and retirement.\nJudging from these spokesmen,\na number of whom exert a wide\ninfluence in the state the next\nmeeting of the association may see\na determined effort to change the\npolicy of the organizalion from\none which has been more or less\ninterested in the students to one\nwhose primary concern is for the\nteachers themselves.\nThe survey also revealed, that\ndespite the preceeding decision in\nthe Atlanta case, the decision in\nthe Bates case has, for the mom\nent at least, left the Negro teach\ners of Mississippi almost complete\nly baffled, and it was plainly evi\ndent that future action on their\npart must wait on a greater unity\nof thought and purpose than was\nfound to exist among them as a\nresult of the decision in the Bates\ncase. *\nWoolridge as she travels on For\neign soil.\nWASHINGTON, D.

I couldn’t help thinking\nas I finally found me a spot in\none of the Ole Avenue’s favorite\nSatdee Night places, that Aint\nHaggar’s Chilluris here in the\nCapital City of the Ole Magnolia\nmust done had their reputation\nspread abroad bout their needs\nfor healing of the body, soul, and\nmind, or else somebody done\nspread the word that the pickin’s\nam mighty good for him who can\nplay on the ’maginations, fears,\nignorance, and superstitions of the\nmembers o-the-tribe from behind\nthe GOOD BOOK. What ’mazed\n; me was the story that a Brother\ntold me and my pal, Burge Brooks,\nthat the Brother had done greased\na goiter that a woman had had\nlor 30 years and it has left oif\nher neck lack the dew leaves off\nthe grass when the sun rises hot\nin the early morning. . . What that\nstory done to me was (I don’t\nknow what it did to Burge Brooks)\nwas to call up in my mind what\nI’d already learned a long time\nago' from some of them hep Farish\nStreeters about what they call a\n“MIT MAN,” which is something\nor somebody I done tried to tell\nyou-alls about here before. Now,\nagain, a “MIT MAN” is a minor\nform of CONFIDENCE MAN,\nwho acts lack he gotta whole lotta\nreligion but ain’t got a thing but\na scheme to get money out of the\npockets of fools and suckers. Here\nlately, I’ve been told a lotta them\n“MIT MAN’S” done gone to play\ning the game from behind the\nGOOD BOOK, seeing that that\nkeeps the police away for the\nlongest time. Now for me, I don’t\nmind my preacher praying for\nme, along with the praying I can\ndo for my own self but when I git\nsick don’t tell me nothing about\nno “MIT MAN,” even if he is\nplaying behind the “Good Book,”\ncause I ain’t crazy and I ain’t\nno fool.\n_\nSOMETHING THAT MADE\nME LAFF: Two Chics standing\non the corner of Farish and Ham\nilton as Brother James Oliver, the\nbig-time Leonard clothing man, J\ndrove by in a brand new red Pack\nard.

KENI)RIY\nMONTE IRVIN RECORDS\nIN MONTGOMERY\nMontgomery, Ala.—Monte Irvin\nmay haVe not set any records in\nthe late World Senes, but he is\nbelieved to have made a record\nhere that will post-date that 30\nyear-old “home” steal, record\nbreaker, in the first game of the\nseries. The Giant’s picture yas\ncarried in column two on the edi\ntorial page of The Montgomery\nAdvertiser—the morning daily of\nthis the former capital of the\nConfederacy.\nTo carry anyone’s picture in\nthe editorial columns of any paper\nis, indeed, unusual. Such would\nseem to be completely out of tune\nwith the American style of jour\nnalism. I had never seen it hap\npen before—not even to Roosevelt,\nChurchill nor Truman. Though\nit may have happened to Hitler\nin Germany, but that was Ger\nmany, and Hitler’s Germany at\nthat.\nNow I am writing about the\nUSA, a daily newspaper in the\ncapital city of Alabama, and a\ntan baseball player whose like\nness has appeared in the editorial\ncolumns of that paper. It is not\nuncommon at all to see the pic\ntures of featured columnists on\nthe editorial pages. But in the\neditorial columns—no! That’s hal- ;\nlowed space, reserved for the edi\ntor.\nMonte’s honor, a great one, too,\ncame to my attention here while\nmeeting with some of Montgom\nery’s leading citizens in the beau\ntiful lobby of this city’s new\nHotel Ben Moore (it’s for Ne\ngroes). Far be it from this writ\ner to discuss the ages of even\nmen—but some of my visiting\ncrew had been around Montgom\nery almost since Jeff Davis said,\n“I do.”\nOne of my guests remarked that\nsuch had not happened in his\ntwenty-five years in Montgomery\n—not to anvone, much less a Ne\ngro. He was promptly challenged,\nthe challenger had domiciled here j\nfor thii ty maybe forty years.\nThis was something new in his\nmemory. Maybe it’s a new edi\ntorial technique of Editor Grover\nC. Hall, Jr. *\nProbably Mr. Hall could see no\nreason why a 123-year-old news-'\npaper could not change its style.\nPublishers being agreeable, I am\ninclined to go with Mr. Hall. But\nwhy did this Montgomery editor\nselect Monte Irvin as his first\npictorial—and the issue October\n1.0 for the introduction of this\nrevolutionary editorial practice?\nThis is it. Monte is an Alabama\nboy, and so is Willie Mays. The\npeople of this state, all of the\nNegroes and most all of the\nwhites, are proud boasters of\ntheir contributions to the Majors.\nThe Montgomery Advertiser, .this\ncorner has to assume, had its\npride in Irvin plus that courage\nto do the real unusual.\nThe picture was accompanied by\none of the finest editorial tributes I\nthat I have ever read. Called,\n“Hail Columbia and Haleburg”\n(the Giant star was born some\nwhere between these two south\neastern Alabama communities),\nthe rendition terms Irvin “an au\nthentically great baseball player,”\nwho has thrilled millions of TV\nlookers and baseball goers.\nReferring to the Aabaman’s\nsalary, the Advertiser placed it\ncurrently at $15,000 “and next\nyear he will possibly get a con\ntract for $25,000. This is,” notes\nthe paper, “more than he would\nhave made had he remained in\nthe increasingly well-known Hale\nburg vicinity.” Here our Mont\ngomery editor is talking Ameii\ncan.\nHe forgets race and admits that\nno baseball player could earn $15,\n000 annually at the national sport,\nin Columbia or Haleburg. ’Tis\na long pitch from what might de\ncry the presence of Negroes in\nthe Big Game, taking no mention\nto the fact that in certain circles\nsuch money would be considered\ntoo much folding moss for a Ne\ngro.\nEditor Hall takes a fast swing\nat the Democrats while reporting\nIrvin’s intention to enter politics j\n—“Whether he runs as a Demo- ■\nm at or a Republican, our inquiry ,\ndid not establish. However, since i\nhis specialty in stealing bases, it!\nis reasonable conjecture that he\nis a Democrat.” Again our edi-!\ntor displayed Americanism—a fun\npoke at an American.\nI saw a wild ball headed my\nway pitched by the same editor,\nwhen he spoke of “the colored’\nman’s physical endowment” being \\\n“characteristically great” and led;\nme almost to conclude that he\n(the editor) would question “how\ngood” the Negro is “in competi\nWEEKLY\nPOEM\nREV.

Clarence\nWinters, 33rd degree, Grand Sec\nretary. They have brought forth\nan organization dedicated to help\ning falling humanity. Not only\nhas the Grand Lodge helped the\nwidows and children in their time\nof need, but is helping morally,\nintellectually, and the spiritual\nimprovement of the individuals\nand society.\nOutstanding features of the\nmeeting will be the annual reports\nof the Grand Secretary of all col\nlections and disbursements an|i\nthe annual report of the Grand\nTreasurer, 111.

An\nother example, our donation to\ndeceased brothers’ beneficiaries\nwas twenty-five dollars, today, it’s\nnever under two hundred dollars\nfrom the Grand Lodge. Today,\nwe can boast of Subordinate\nLodges in nearly every nook and\ncorner of the State.\nNearly all Subordinate Lodges\nare making extra donations to\ntheir deceased’s beneficiaries. Some\nin the amount of one hundred dol\nlars. Some of the Subordinate\nLodges pay other expense on the\nfuneral and a donation to their\nsick. These lodges also have bank\naccounts which the Grand Lodge\nhas nothing to do with. No wait\ning, no installment payments; do\nnations made in due notice of\ndeath.\nThe M. W. King Hiram Grand\nLodge has thousands of dollars in\nthe bank in Government bonds,\nsavings account and checking ac\ncount. All indebtedness paid.

We do not\npolice the State to put anyone in\nthe right one, as we believe all\nshould join the organization that\nmeans the most to them and their\nfamilies.
