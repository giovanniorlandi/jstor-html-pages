It provides:\n1. That all capital shipbuilding pro\ngrams, either actual or projected,\nshould be abandoned.\n2. That further reduction should be\nmade through the scrapping of certair\naf the older ships.\n3. That In general regard should b*\nheld to the existing naval strength o!\nthe powers concerned.\n4. That the capital ship tonnage\nshould be used as the measurement of\nitrength for navies and*a proportion\nate allowance of auxiliary combatant\n•:raft prescribed.\nHughes surprised the Conference by\npresenting & concrete proposition for\narms limitation #hen he accepted Ri\nchairmanship. He emphasized tha;\nthere is need to take Immediate ac\nlion on arms limitation.\n“It wotfTd also seem to be a vital\npart oi?** plan for the limitation ot\nnaval armament that there should br\na naval holiday,” Hughes said. "It is\nproposed that for a period of not less\nthan 10 years there should be nr\nfurther construction of capital ships.\n\'1 am happy to say that I am at lib\nerty to go beyond these general propc\nsitlons, and on behalf of the Amerlcai\ndelegation, acting under the instruo\ntions of the President to submit to yo>\na concrete proposition for an agree\nment for the limitation of naval arm a\nment.\n“It should be added that this pro\nposal immediately concerns the British\nEmpire, Japan and the United States\nIn view of the extraordinary condition;\ndue to the World War affecting tb<\nexisting gtrength of the navies o\nFrance and Italy, it ia not thought t<\nbe necessary to discuss at this stage ot\nthe proceedings the tonnage allowance\nof these nations. But the tfnited Btateh\nproposes that this matter be reserved\nfor the consideration of the Confer\nence.\n“In making the present proposal the\nUnited States is most solicitous t<\ndeal with the question upon an entire\nly reasonable and practical basis, tc\nthe end that the Just interests of al’\nshall be adequately guarded, and thaf\nnational security and defense shall be\nmaintained.”\nGives Plan in Detail.\nHughes outlined then how the Amer\nlean delegation believes the naval\nArmament of the world should be\nmade, giving in detail Just what this\nGovernment believes each nation\nshould agree to.\nThe principal features of the pro\nposed agreement, in the words ot\nHughes, are as follows:\nCAPITAL SHIPS\nThe United States is now complet\ning its program of 1916, calling for 10\nnew battleships and six battle shlpf\nand six battle cruisers. One battle\nship has been completed. The others\nare in various stages of construction,\nin some cases from 60 to more than\n80 per cent, of the construction has\nbeen done. On these 15 capital shipr\nnow being built more than |330,000,00t\nhas been spent. Still the United States\nIs willing, in the interest of an im\nmediate limitation of naval armament\nto scrap all these ships.\nThe United States proposes, if this\nplan is accepted—\n(l) To scrap all capital ships now\nunder construction. This includes six\nbattle cruisers and seven battleships\non the ways, and in course of building.\nThe total number of new capital\nships thus to be scrapped is 15. The\ntotal tonnage of the new capital ships\nIf completed would be 618,000 tons.\n? sQfap/all of the oitier bat\ntleships up Co, but not including, the\nDelaware and North Dakota. The\nnumber of these old battleships to be\nscrapped is 15. - Their total tonnage\nis 227,740 tons.\nThus the number of capital ships to\nbe scrapped by the United States, if\nthis plan Is accepted, is 30, with an\naggregate tonnage (including that of\nships in construction if completed) of\n845.740 tons.\nGREAT BRITAIN AND JAPAN\nThe plan contemplates that Great\nBritain and Japan shall Ufke action\nwhich is fairly commensurate with\nthis action on the part of the tfnited\nStates.\nIt is proposed that Great Britain—\n1. Shall stop further construction\nof the four new hoods\' the hew capital\nships not laid down hut upon which\nTONG FUEDIBTS CONVICTED.\nFive Chines* Found Guilty Of First-\nDegree Murder.\nMarysville, Cal.

In addition, scrap her pre\ndreadnaughts, second-line battleship*\nand first-line battleships up to but uot\nIncluding the King George V class.\nThese, with certain pre-dreadnaughts\nwhich already have been scrapped,\nw\'outd amount to 18 capital ships and\na tonnage reduction of 411,375 tons.\nThe total tonnage of ships thus to be\nscrapped by Great Britain (including\nthe tonnage of tbe four hoods, if com\npleted), would be 583.375 tons.\nJAPAN\nIt Is proposed that Japan—\n1. Shall abandon her program of\n\'hips not yet laid down, vis., the Klf,\nQwarL No. 7 and No. 8 battleships and\nNos. 5,6, 7 and 8 battle cruisers.\nit should bs observed this does not\ninvolve the stopping of construction,\nls the construction of none of these\n*hlps has been begun.\n2. Shall scrap three capital ships\n(the Mutsu, launched: the Tosa and\niCago, in course of building), and four\n>attle cruisers (the Amagl and Akagi.\nin the course of building, and the\nTtoga and Takao, not yet laid down\nbut for which certain material has\n>eeu assembled).\nThe total number of new capital\nships to be scrapped under this para\n;raph Is seven. The total tonnage oi\nthese new capital ships when com\npleted would be 289.100 tons.\n3. Shall scrap all predreadnaughts\nnd battleships of the second line\nThis woult include the scrapping of\nill ships up to but not including the\n3ettsu—that is, the scrapping of Id\nuaer ships, with a total tonnage of\n159,828 tons.\nJohn W.

NOVEMBER 18. 1921.\nTHE RED CROSS ROLL CALL.\nThe annual “roll call” of the\nAmerican lied Cross which open\ned on Armistice day and sched\nuled to continue until Thanks\ngiving, is well timed. The minds\nand the hearts of America are\nfilled with memories of the war.\nEvents, crowding fast, one after\nthe otheiyliave given.-the lie to\nthe assertion that we have been\nswift to forget the tragic lesson\nof yesterday. And it is natural\nthat as America thinks of those\nterrific days and their effect up\non the future, our thoughts\nshould include thj American\nRed Cross.\nThe history of the war service\nof those who, under an insigna\nwhich has become the world\nwide symbol for succor rendered\nin pity and understanding and\nfriendship, demands no re\nhearsal. The memory thereof is\nstill fresh. The truths which to\nday demand the attention of the\nnation are other than those\nwhich concern the Red Cross\nand the war. They deal with\nthe achievements of the orgam\nzation since the return of the\nAmerican armies from overseas.\nFor it is upon this basis, rather\nthan uj.on the capitalization of\nwar rec.ord. that the support, of\nthe public for the future must be\nsought. And with its record for\nthe past year in its hands the\nRed Cross justly sounds its roll\ncall for the year which is ahead\nwith pride and confidence.\nThat record establishes the\nfact that during each month of\nthe year in question the lied\nCross has been in touch with an\naverage of 129,215 ex-service\nmen and their iamilies. It shows\nthat today the organization is\nproviding service costing $lO,-\n000,000 a year to veterans of the\nwar; that 1,163 nurses have\nbeen furnished the public health\nservice; that 500,445 children\nhave been inspected for physical\ndefects and means of their cor\nrection recommended; that $5,-\n000,000 has been contributed to\nthe starving children of Europe\nand 3,000,000 garments made for\ndistribution among them; that\n$500,000 in relief has been sent\nto famine-stricken China, assist\nance rendered in seventy disas\nters in the United States and 260\nhealth centers established\nthroughout the country.\nThat record is the recommen\ndation of the American Red\nCross for the continued support\nsupport of the nation. Dedica\nted to "the service of those who\nsuffer,” the organization is no\nless splendidly equipped for the\nneeds of today and tomorrow\nthan it was for those of the yes\nterdays in which its workers\nwon the heart!elt gratitude of\nof America for war services\nfaithfully and heroically per\nformed.\nCharles countians cannot and\nshould not make but hearty re\nsponse as the roll is called.\nArmistice Day in Washington.\nTho Rotogravue Section of The\nWashington aim - , Sunday, November\nlit), will contain photographs of events\nin Washington on Armistice Day—the\nburial of the unknown soldier at Ar\nlington national cemetery and the\nopening of the conference ou limitation\noi armament—two special features of\nthe news of the day.

To do this, it must have a competent, trained\nforce of employees and pay them a living wage; it must\nuse the best materials and equipment and pay for them\nat the market price.\nV.\nThe other obligation is to expand its system to be in\na position to give service to all new patrons. This re\nquires new capital. To command this new capital at all\ntimes, the investor—the person who hat money to lend\n—must receive a fair return for its use.\nThe telephone system offers a striking example of\nthese two obligations. Each new subscriber to the sys\ntem involves not only a direct increase in the expense of\ngiving service, but an outlay of new capital.\n■\nTherefore, a telephone system that does not earn\nan adequate revenue fails in its obligations to its patron*.\nj \' av v\nThe Chesapeake & Potomac\nTelephone lS) Company\nR.

Was the\nwhole load affected? What was the\nttetua) condition on arrival? Was the\nloss due to bad handling and packing\nor to delay or neglect by the trans\nportation company or by the receiver?\nWas the cause a disease which may\ndevelop also in the rest of the crop?\nSome of these questions interest the\nreceiver and the railways, as well as\nthe shipper or producer. No one cares\nto assume blame and incur loss for\nwhat happened to the produce while\nit was in the hands of others. How\ncan all these questions be settled with\nout undue expense or delay?\nSince the peniiiinhmfnt of the fed\neral inspection service three years ago\nby the bureau of markets and crop\nestimates of the United States Depart\nment of Agriculture, the answer is\ncomparatively simple. “Telegraph to\nthe federal Inspector In the nearest\nlarge city, asking him to report on the\nshipment.” He is a trained man, with\nconsiderable experience In handling\nproduce, a competent and certified\nJudge of grades and condition.\nThe inspector’s verdict is commonly\naccepted by dealers and shippers and\nby courts, railways and express com\npanies. With the shipment officially\nInspected, all parties concerned have\nlearned all that It Is practicable to\nknow about its exact condition and\nInspector Determining the Condition\nof a Shipment of Potatoes.\ngrade, and many causes of trouble\nsome disputes, costly lawsuits and last\ning dissatisfaction are removed. The\nInspector’s certificate removes fully\nhalf of the sources of worry und un\ncertainty and narrows the market\nquestion down chiefly to a matter of\nsalesmanship.\nAnyone financially concerned in the\nshipment may ask for Inspection. If\nthere is trouble over the produce, or\nIf there is merely the wish to avoid\npossible difficulty later on, the appli\ncant writes or telegraphs to the United\nStates food products Inspection serv\nice, bureau of markets and crop esti\nmates, iu the city where the car is to\nle received.\nCertificate as Evidence.\nThe idea of official Inspection Is to\nprovide a reliable, disinterested report\nas a basis for settling disputes regard\ning quantity, quality, grade or condi\ntion. No matter who asks for it or\nwho pays the bill, whether producer,\ndealer or railway, the other party may\nhave a copy of the report. If the\nshipper and dealer can not agree, or\nif there is a damage claim against a\ntransportation company which results\nIn a suit, the certificate is prima facie\nevidence In the federal courts on the\npoints which it covers.\nThe request for inspection should\ntell where the car may be found and\nthe number, and should give also the\nmain facts about the contents, calling\nittentlon to any special point%s to\ngrade, quality or condition.\nGravel Floor*.\nDon’t worry because you don’t have\nu cement floor in your poultry house.\nGravel or a good grade of dry earth\nmakes a perfectly satisfactory floor,\nproviding it Is filled in to be a foot or\nmore higher than the surrounding sur\nface and dry at all times of year.\nFowls Will Eat Silage.\nMost fowls will also eat me ensilage\ncut for cattle, although It is usually\ncut too coarse for them, os they pre\nfer their food very fine.\nUnprofitable Cow.\nIt doesn’t take a son of a prophet\nto tel! that there’s no profit In a cow\nthat costs more to keep than her\nmilk sells for.\nClean Water Preferred.\nPigs prefer clean drinking water.\nSlats on the trough will keep the\nporkers from wallowing.\nHogging Down Corn..\nHogging down some of the corn is\n\\a ecoueit| ! ce* way of harvesting It.\nINOCULATE ALFALFA\nAND KINDRED CROPS\nDepartment of Agriculture Out\nlines Three Methods.\nWhen Broadcasting Avoid Undue E*\nposure to Sun\'s Rays and Imme\ndiately Harrow Field—Liquid\nPure Cultures Are Used.\n(Prepared by the United States Department\not Agriculture.>\nFarmers sowing alfalfa in ground\nwhere alfalfa or related crops, such\nas bur clover or sweet clover, have\nnot been grown before, will find It\nadvisable to inoculate the soil with the\nproper kind of nitrogen-fixing bac\nteria. The same is true of clover\npeas or any other legume. The\nUnited States Department of Agricul\nture says there are three principal\nmethods of* inoculating soil—by direct\napplication of soli from a field known\nto have suitable bacteria, by pure cul\n- nirc Inoculation, and by the glue\nmethod.\nFor the first, It Is well to apply at\nleast 200 pounds of finely sifted in\noculated soil per acre. This can be\ndone with the fertilizer attachment of\nthe drill, or broadcasting by hand.\nBroadcasting will require a larger\nquantity and should be done In the\nearly morning, late evening or on a\nMaking Examination of Alfalfa for\nNodules.\ncloudy day to avoid undue exposure\nto the sun’s rays. The field should be\nimmediately harrowed after broad\ncasting. Transferring soil from any\nconsiderable distance is expensive end\nsubject to the danger of Introducing\ntroublesome weeds, insects and plant\ndiseases.\nAn easier method of field soil in\noculation which has met with success\nwhere only a small amount of inocu\nlated soil Is available is to coat the\nseed with Inoculated soil by means of\nordinary furniture glue.\nDissolve two handfuls of glue for\nevery gallon of boiling water and al\nlow the solution to cool. Put the seed\nin a washtub and then sprinkle enough\nof the solution on It to moisten, but\nnot to wet it (oue quart per bushel\nis sufficient), and stir the mixture\nthoroughly until all the seed is mois\ntened.\nObtain inoculated soil from fi place\nwhere the same kind of plants as the\nseed are growing, making sure that\nthe roots have a vigorous development\nof nodules. Dry the soil in the shade\nand pulverize It. Scatter this dust\nover the moistened seed, using from\ntwo to four quarts of dirt for each\nbushel of seed, mixing thoroughly un\ntil the seeds no longer stick together.\nLiquid pure cultures are prepared\nby the Department of Agriculture and\nare mailed in limited quantities on ap\nplication, not more than enough for\none bushel of one kind of seed to any\nperson. They are also sold by private\nconcerns. Complete directions are\nmailed with each bottle.\nFEEDING TESTS WITH FOWLS\nMixture of Bran, Middlings, Meat\nScrap and Com Meal Is Ideal\nfor Producing Eggs.\nAs a result of eight years’ feeding\ntests at the United States Department\nof Agriculture poultry yards at Belts\nvllle, Md., a mash feed has been com\npounded which gives uniform high\negg production. This mash, which has\nbeen tested for three years, is made\nof 4 per cent bran, 4 per cent mid\ndlings, 26 per cent meat scrap, and\n66 per cent cornmeal. In the experi\nments the liens were allowed to select\ntheir own mash ingredients. This is\nthe proportion of those different feeds\nwhich they ate during the year.\nSeveral pens of 30 hens each, both of\nLeghorns and of Rhode Island Reds,\nhave averaged from 140 to 155 eggs\napiece while this mash was fed. While\nthe mash seems to be especially adapt\ned for Leghorns, it has given very\ngood results with Reds. Wynndottes\nand Plymouth Rocks were found to\nget too fat on the ration and a mash\nsomewhat lower in meat scrap has\ngiven better results with these breeds.\nBoth the Wyandottes and Plymouth\nLocks at Beltsville are large standard\nsized fowls. The tendency to become\noverfat on this mash probably would\nnot be found in a smaller type of\nPlymouth Rocks, such as is often\nfound on commercial poultry farms.\nCo-operation Is Needed.\ni Just as soon as growers reach the\npoint where they are willing to co\ni operate with their neighbors, instead\nof competing with them, Just so soon\nwill the marketing problem be on the\nroad to solution.\nFeeding Horses Alfalfa.\nHorses, of course, should not be fed\nall the alfalfa hay they will eat, be\ncause they like it so well that they\nwould secure too much protein and\nalso too much bulk.\nAlfalfa Increases Egg Yield.\nFarmers must not think that alfalfa\nIs grown for cows only, it is a splen\ndid feed for all kinds of farm animals.\nNo stock kept on the farm will make\nbetter use of alfalfa than the growing\nchicks and laying hens.\nClean Wallows for Swine.\nFilthy hog wallows may beep your\nhogs cool during hot weather, * but\nclean wallows are just as effective\nin that respect, and not dangerous to\nI Lite health of the animals.\nSure Relief\nFOR INDIGESTION\nfyigiP\n6^tu-*ws\n25<t and 75* Packages.
