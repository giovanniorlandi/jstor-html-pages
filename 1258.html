        <pre>['I s\nI rntv(.MSity of Utah. H\nI Goodwins Weeklj\nVol. 25 . SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, DECEMBER 4, 1915 No 25\nv\nAn Independent Paper Published Under\n:: the Management of J. T. Goodwin ::\nEDITORIALS BY JUDGE C. C. QObDWIN\nSome Work Ahead\nTHE majority in congress will not meet in the\nsame mood next week that they were in\nwhen they convened two years ago. Then the\nthought was: "At last we will show \'em." Now\nthe thought will be, "What kind of a showing can\nwe make to save our faces, and at the same time\nhave a little something to our credit for next sum\nmer\'s campaign?"\n"When they attained to power, they proceeded,\nagainst every protest, to smash the protective\ntariff which had a little fenced the American\nfield against the starving stock of the outside\nworld. And when they had completed that work\nthey held a praise service of thanksgiving, the\npraise being mostly praise of themselves. In this\nPresident Wilson was the chief tenor and Mr.\nUnderwood, the deep-chested contralto.\nThey praised, too, a far-reaching income tax\nlaw.\nNow the results show that despite the great\nincrease of revenue from the income tax there is\na mighty deficit and it is plain that except for\nvastly increased business due to the war, busi\nness generally would be so dead today that their\nparty would be in a state of hopeless coma.\nThe operation of the present tariff smashing\nlaw, was suspended, on some articles, at the time\n, of the passage, for twenty months. The tariff on\nsugar was one that was suspended.\nr\n\' Now we hear that the tariff on sugar is to be\ncontinued, "for revenue only," as though any\n\' tariff was ever levied for any other purpose.\nThere will be a tremendous effort, evidently,\nto set the shipyards ringing on new ships, the\nnecessity being laid to the war abroad, as though\nthat necessity had not been just as apparent every\nhour for a quarter of a century past, as it is to\nday. And how to run that new fleet by making\nup its deficit out of the treasury instead of imitat-\nft ing the great marine nations, will require some\n, more very adroit reasoning.\nWhen the program shall be completed, we\nshall all be able to see how much more effective\nis the prospect of a political campaign in the\nimmediate future to restore our merchant marine,\n, than the example of the great ocean-carrying na-\nr- tions through the past thirty years has been.\n-U\nWe are all waiting to see whether any change\nwill be recommended of that policy which Mr.\nPinchot inaugurated a dozen years ago which,\njK briefly stated, was, "Our most benevolent gov-\n" ornment wants the eager \'pioneer to go on the\n) ffi waste places of the west and occupy and subdue\n\' , them, but we caution those pioneers that if they\n5f" find anything out of which they may nurse a hope\n-,. of making a living, we shall be constrained to\nW\'i . spread reservation over it in the interest of all\nthe people of the country and some others who\nmay come to us from beyond the sea."\nThere are many other subjects which should\nworry the majority a little; such as our place as\nneutrals, the Mexican program that has been\npursued, the possibility of having to issue bonds\nto keep the gold reserve solid, etc. It is not go\ning to be altogether a holiday for the majority\nin congress this winter.\nMcAdoo\'s Plan\nBECAUSE of his official and personal relations\nto the president, we suspect Secretary Mc\nAdoo outlines the policy which the president will\nurge in his message next week for the restoration\nof the United States merchant marine through\nthe building by the government of some lines of\nsteamships.\nThat will be better than nothing at all, but it\nis not the best way. The proposition will be put\nout as a necessity because of the vastly increased\nexports of the country due to the war and the\nneed of the ships as auxiliary ships for the navy.\nOf course all this is but beating the devil around\nthe stump, because every steamship built in the\nUnited States has been an auxiliary of the navy\nwhen required, and the increased exports are due\nsolely to the war and of necessity must be limited\nto the war\'s duration. The effort is to find ex\ncuses for building ships and for charging the\nnecessary deficits, which their running will incur\ndirectly to the government. Before Mr. Wilson\'s\nelection he had a plan to fill the seas with profit\nable merchant ships that were to run without\nsubsidies or bounties.\nWhat would have happened to him had he ex\nplained that their losses were to be made up by\ngoing down into the treasury and taking out the\npeople\'s money to meet the deficits. Was he\nafraid that some one would ask him what differ\nent in tho result that would be from paying di\nrect bounties or subsidies? And when Mr. Secre\ntary McAdoo ascribes the necessity for this to\nthe war, and to the immense sums now being\npaid foreign ship owners, that is to laugh, for\nthere has not been a country editor who under\nstood the question, who has not been pointing out\nthose tremendous sums paid to foreign ship own\ners, at least once a week for the past twenty\nyears, and how American trade was handicapped\nby such a policy.\nNow Mr. Secretary points it out as a great\nnew discovery that has dawned upon him.\nBut his present attitude shows that even a\nhardened Bourbon can sometimes grasp a new\nidea, which is a hopeful sign.\nBut while it is better than nothing for tho gov\nernment to build and sail the ships, it is not the\nright way, for these reasons: First, it is another\ncentralization of power in federal hands which is\nnot at all desirable; second, government officials\ndo not understand the class of ships to build, as\nship owners and masters know; third, govern\nment officers do not know what the trade re\nquires, and, bo long as their salaries are paid\nthem, they will not much care.\nFinally, it Is all wrong in principle, it is a dl-\nrect interference on the part of the government\nwith the private business of the people, for which j\nthere Is no possible justification. "H\nIt is the business of the government to remove\nall possible obstacles from tho paths of citizens M\nand taxpayers, not to put obstacles in their way. M\nMr. Perkins Again Active H\nA NOTHER national election is drawing near; \'M\nMr. George W. Perkins is again writing es- M\nsays. We have one before us in which tho gentle- M\nman says to prove that "we are as unprepared for M\npeace as we are for war." M\nHe does not tell us anything new but ho writes M\ninterestingly. Ho tells us that "every man from M\nMaine to California who is in any way engaged in M\nbanking or industrial pursuits know that when M\nthis war broke out, the business of this country H\nwas rapidly shutting down. Factories were clos- M\ning or going on short time. Thousands of men H\nwere being thrown out of work and an Industrial H\ndepression was upon us." M\nThe first thing to attract attention in the M\nabove is the distinction that Mr. Perkins makes \'\nbetween "banking and industrial pursuits." Wo M\nhad thought that banking was an industrial pur- H\nsuit, for tho bankers have certainly run this coun- H\ntry\'s business since 1893. But no matter. Two H\nyears before tho war came, some of us predicted lM\nwhat would happen should there come a Demo- \'H\ncratic tariff-smashing revision of the then exist- H\ning tariff, but that did not prevent Mr. Perkins H\nfrom putting up the money to place Col. Roose- H\nvelt in a position to elect a Democratic president. H\nNow he favors a non-partisan tariff commis- H\nsion. A tariff commission has been advocated by H\nthoughtful men for years, but how is it to bo H\nmade, non-partisan? H\nNo other question has been discussed so mucn H\nas the tariff question. Every argument for and H\nagainst it was exhausted half a century ago and H\nevery man is for or against it. The acts of the H\npresent administration have established that the H\nBourbons now in the saddle are incapable of H\nchanging their minds on that question, but that H\nwith every new generation they come like the\nseventeen year locusts, to eat up every green\nthing. Mr. Perkins thinks that the need of pro\ntection is so great against what will come to us\nwhen the great foreign war closes, that a great\npetition will move congress this winter to provide\nfor a tariff commission. Maybe, but It will not\nbe for the reasons given by Mr. Perkins; it will\nbe from fear of what will happen the party next\nsummer unless something is done.\nMr. Perkins wants a great merchant marine\nand mournfully deplores the fact that tho Pacific\nMail Steamship company has been obliged to sell\nits 224,000 tons of steamships on the Pacific and\nascribes this necessity to the La Follette shipping\nlaw.\nMr. Perkins is a banker and cannot see the\nreal cause. The Pacific Mail company had not\npaid a dividend in fifteen years before its sale.\nPossibly Mr. Perkins cannot comprehend that\nby inverse action the law that demonetized sll-\nr', '- - - i,. ... .!,,. ,- .-- -- - -- . ..- --- \' \'" WMBWJ Win iiiiiii ""\' iw "\'"\' \'\' " "-"-\' fl\nH 2 GOODWIN\'S WEEKLY. \'I\nH vcr killed our exports to the Orient and at the\nH same time offered in effect a premium of GO per\nH cent upon all that the Orient could send us.

Roosevelt to get ready to re-elect the\nH Democratic administration.\nBy Contrast With Utah\nWHEN certain students of the editorial corps\nof the Utah university murmured because\nM the faculty of the school put a ban upon running\nH tobacco advertisements in their student\'s maga-\nH zine, the Deseret News, editorially, in sorrow and\nH wrath, read those vagabond students a brief lee\nH From it the New York Times copies the fol-\nH lowing:\nH The same argument which would lead to the\nH rejection of the one class of announcements would\nH also lead to the rejection of the other. People of\nH sense and discrimination will be amazed that any\nH such question could have arisen, especially here\nH in Utah.\nH Upon that the Times in its own ponderous\nM way exhausts half a column of mingled humor\nH and satire. In passing we may mention that about\nH the most serious feature of tlie Times is one of\nH its humorous flights and when at the same time\nH it tries to make its jokes caustic, then to the or-\nM dinary reader a blue print . is needed to make\nB clear just what it really means. But it is clear\nM that the local pride of The Times is wounded by\nH the "especially here in Utah" of the News. Great\nB as The Times is and wise beyond belief as it is,\nH it evidently cannot comprehend that we in Utah\nH "are a peculiar people." Not only sinless in our-\nH selvesbut avoiding the very appearance of sin; a\nH people wlio regulate our morals by statute and\nM the grace of God, and neither admit nor permit\nH any lapses from sanctity.\nH The Times refers to the fact that the men in\nM the navy when out on the lonely sea, and the sol-\nH diers in the bloody trenches in the pauses of trio\nfl battle storm, crave the soothing that the pipe\nI ESTATES\nH The cost of our services as Admin-\nH istrator or Executor of Estates is usually\nH but one-third, and never exceeds one-\nH half that allowed by Law to the inex-\nH perienced Administrator, and yet because\nH of our knowledge and experience, we\nH can in every case, save the Estate many\nH times the cost of our services.\nH The President or Trust Officer of\nH this Company will be pleased to confer\nH with you upon this subject.\nTracy Loan &\nTrust Company\nbrings them, but what has that to do with a now\nand then depraved Utah student, who fain would\npurloin and burn a poison-laden stogy or cigarette?\nThe Times knows that not half the vote of Tam\nmany Hall could be brought out without tobacco,\nbut what has that to do with a state where all\nthe ladies vote and where no gentleman would\npuff tobacco smoke in a lady\'s face when she\nessayed to vote.\nThe use of tobacco may be justified in New\nYork because a tobacco breath is not so offensive\nas the natural breath of many people there, but\nthat has no application in Utah where there is\nno more taint in the bodies of the people than\nthere is in the perfume of the roses in the gardens\nof Cashmere. There is no music where there are\nno ears to hear. How could a deaf man describe\na grand opera? How can an utterly wordly news\npaper, like The Times, give any idea of the moral\nstatus of Utah or the customs that govern hero?\nOn celery day next Monday a bunch of Utah\ncelery should be sent to The Times editor and\nwith it a note that Utah celery is typical of Utah\nmorals and by tasting the celery the editor may\nknow how impotant are all his attempts to form\nan estimate of Utah morals.\nThe disposition of the few indents in our\nuniversity to use and advertl. ceo can only\nbo accounted for through that . which nature\nsometimes indulges in, as when tho colt of a black\nhorse and black dam appears in the mouse color\nwhich its immemorial ancestors adopted, so that\nthe wild (beasts could not distinguish them from\nthe dried grass in which they pastured. It is a\nbreeding back, and so Ave are sorry to have to\nconfess that now and then a child is bora in Utah\nwith all the depraved instincts of a New York\nchild, but who shall say that it is the rule?\nThe Order Of Man Needed\nTVERY American should, in a quiet way, be a\nJ-J politician, and every American should be daily\ncalling over the names of the men who have been\nnamed as possible candidates for the presidency\nnext summer and measuring in thought their ca\npabilities for the high place.\nIf a man who could not speak a word, say of\nFrench, were to apply for the position of French\nprofessor in one of our great universities, no mat\nter what his accomplishments in other lines\nmight be, he would be derided. If a man wanted\nto be superintendent of a great railway system\nand urged his fitness for the place because he\nonce ran a blind mule on a mining whim, his\nservices would probably be rejected. Because a\nman is a first-class blacksmith that\' fact would H\nhardly secure him a place as first-class watch-\nmaker. j!\ni\nWhen General Santa Anna arrived on the field\nof Buena Vista, he sent to General Taylor a note\nreminding "Old Zack" that he was surrounded by\nan army of more than twenty-two thousand men,\nmore than four to one, and demanding his surren\nder. Major Bliss wrote back and in most polite jlf\nphrases informed the Mexican general that Gen-\noral Taylor had received his demand, but most re-\nspectively declined to accede to it. I\nWhat Taylor really instructed Bliss to write I\nwas: "Tell the d d greaser to go to hell."\nA little crude from a literary and polite stand- I\npoint, but all the same the army felt safer under\nGeneral Taylor than it would have felt under\nMajor Bliss, for the business on hand at the mo\nment was decidedly strenuous and it was neces\nsary for the man in command to know how to\nmount and ride a storm of that kind.\nA steamship company would hardly trust the ,\ncommand of a great ship to a man who had\nnever been to sea and our great ship of state re\nquires a pilot that has had some practical knowl\nedge of the machinery within it and of the storms\nand currents of the great deep beyond the harbor\nbar; of how mutinous crews are managed, and\nhow to evade a breaker-beaten coast.\nAnd with the needed knowledge there should\nbo a steady judgment to govern when the skies\nare dark, when the mariner cannot take the sun at\nmidday and all the stars are blotted out at night.\nHe who rules above is best comprehended\nthrough His omnipotent work. He not only\nframed the laws that govern the universe, but I\nwith His hands He fashioned the worlds and set\ntheir solemn courses in space. A most wise and\nexperienced and steady-trained man is needed for\npresident of the United States.\n"The Pilgrim Train"\nIT is good to read that Gilbert A.

Scott\nFOR forty years he was active in the business\ncircles of this city. He was past forty whon he\ncame here; he had passed through all the exper\niences of the Argonauts there were not many\nmore excitements for him. He came here ripe in\njudgment, devoted in principle, a staunch and\nsturdy American; fixed in belief that no other\nland compared with his; jealous of its honor and\nits claims upon all citizens and zealous in its sup\nport. He engaged in business and carried it on\nfaithfully until time readied over\'liis shoulder\nand took the pen from his hand and touching his\nbrain gave him notice that his work was finished.\nSince then he has been waiting in life\'s twi\nlight for the night that has now come. That twi\nlight began filled with old remembrances, like de\nlicious dreams, the quiet of a most sorrowful un- i\nnatural childhood, the excitements that filled his\nlife as the Golden State was rounded into form, v$ \'\nthe obstacles met and surmounted until the calm I\nfinally came until "the windows began to be I\ndarkened and the clouds returned after the rain." j\nNow the wornout tabernacle has fallen from\naround his soul, the merciful earth has opened Its\narms to receive him and shade his eyes from the\nlight.

But\nsubsequent events have proven that this doctor\nIs nothing but a sensational advertiser, his speech \'\ni at the recent performance of "The Unborn" in\nNew York, which had as Its theme the proJem.\nsfef defective infants, proving the contention that\ni he was not actuated by a desire to start a prop\nj aganda to benefit humanity but one in which the\nbenefits would accrue to Dr. Halselden was true.\nThe technical report of the malformation, of the\nbody as disclosed by the records of the coroner\'s\noffice may not be published here; suffice to say\nthat it would have been utterly impossible to\nsave the life of the defective and the doctor knew\n1 It when he broke Into print.\n\' In reference to the nauseating publicity caused\nby the affair, the Journal of the American Medical\n: association says: "Sensational medical articles in\nnewspapers have become a common every-day oc-\ni currence. Pathology is now a breakfast table\ntopic and the science of eugenics agitates the\nI fluttering breasts of stately matrons and young\n! debutantes at afternoon teas. The most recent\nI sensation concerns the action of a Chicago phys-\ni ician regarding an infant marred by various an-\n1 omalies of development. The newspapers featured\ni the case; they elaborated it with gossip and dis\ncussion; with opinions from physicians; with the\nstatements of social workers and psychologists;\nwith letters of mothers and even of crippled and\nimbecile children. And the end is not yet. One\nnewspaper publishes an autobiography of the\nphysician, who promises to write, in. serial form,\nthe story of the case. The whole incident is\nnauseating. Infants with similar anomalies are\nborn almost dally; no two cases aro exactly\nalike; each is a problem unto itself. In this in\nstance, apparently, the rights of the individual\nhave been flippantly considered and the sacred\nness of the home has been ruthlessly bandied m\npublic. Nothing has been nor can anything ever\nbe gained by such disgusting discussion as has\naccompanied this particular incident. One per\nson has been basking in the limelight of publicity,\nbut in this instance it is not the brightness of the\nspotlight but a yellow sickly flame."\nIt would seem to us that the only real argu\nments against physicians attempting to save the\nlife of defectives may be found in the possibility\nof making a mistake or in those cases where\na practitioner of criminal bent could take ad\nvantage of the opportunities he would have if the\npractice were made general.\nThe Rev. Will R. Betts broke out in a new\nplace on Sunday with a tirade on dancing. It\nseems that anyone who dances endangers his or\nher best interests both moral and spiritual and\nthat as far into antiquity as history goes, the\ndance, either in savage or civilized nations, has\nalways been regarded with suspicion.\nBilly rather likes the Greek dancing though,\nbecause he says that it is worthy of note that\namong the Greeks, the hands and arms were used\nmore than the legs. He hesitated some time on\nthe waltz in reviewing the history of the terpsl\nchorean art and added that\' at first it was too\n"rank" to be tolerated In society, but later got by,\nand finally overcame the last obstacle. Among\nother things he asked, "What right has custom to\nbreak into the sanctity of the home and do in\npublic what if discovered in private would ruin\ncharacter." He says\' he was speaking of course\nof the opposite sexes dancing together. Ana\namong other Remarks, he Is quoted as having said,\n"I have no objection to men waltzing with a man,\nbut for some reason they will not do it that way."\nOh, William, naughty, naughty!

The exper\nience of the past sixteen months has established\nthat the foremost nations do not regard their most\nsacred covenants when they are seeking added\nlands and power.\nIt has made clear, too, the truth of the words\nof Alexander Hamilton, which were to the effect\nthat a neutral nation has no standing unless pre\npared to enforce its neutrality.\nBoth Great Britain and Germany have done\nthings in the present war which neither would\nhave thought of doing had the United States pos\nsessed the means to enforce its neutrality.\n"We have not only our own country to look out\nfor, but we are under solemn obligations to main\ntain the Monroe doctrine in its entirety.\nWhatever the cost may be, it should be remem\nbered that it is but insurance money and how\never great the sum, it can be as nothing com\npared with what a six months\' war would be.\nOf course, there should be a defined plan broad\nenough to cover all the forms and methods of war\ncoast defenses, ships, inland depots, factories\nfor making war material, submarines, air ships,\nproper armament for every branch of service and\nbehind all the fitting of men for the duties they\nwould be called upon to fill in the event of a real\nwar.\nIndeed, it should go beyond all that. Chemis\ntry, mechanics, invention and experiments with ex\nplosives and the searching for the yet unknown\npowers of electricity, should all be included In\nthe search for more destructive agents which are,\neventually, to make war impossible through their\n- very destructiveness.\nThe present war has taught that only force is\nrespected when all the fierce passions of men and\nnations are aroused.\nIt was said in ancient days that "The tap of\nCaesar\'s finger would awe a senate."\nThat was simply because those senators knew\nthat old Julius could fight and was able to put up\na first-class fight when he essayed to.\nAnd that knowledge has been a controlling one\nthrough all the ages. Men and nations respect\nother men and nations according to their ability\nto defend themselves against enemies.\n. When tho present war ceases, those engaged\nin it now will be in savage humor and they will\nj all look upon a rich but undefended nation with\ncovetous eyes.\nHe was an able-bodied Englishman, out of work,\nand made a genial request for a little assistance.\nIt was perhaps natural for the donor of two-pence\nto inquire whether the recipient had contemplat\ned enlisting in the army. "I\'d go like a shot, sir,"\ncame the answer, "but I\'ve such a \'ot temper, and\nwhen I read what them Germans \'ave done I can\'t\n\'Id myself in.

Koyser which took place in San Francisco on\nM Wednesday was the happy culmination of a\nfl pretty romance that progressed through the sum-\nB mer months while their innumerable friends look-\ned on approvingly. It has been known for soma\nB time that they were engaged and just before Miss\nB Dunn left with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. F.\nB Dunn, for San Francisco, and Mr. Keyser followed\nB a week later, they confided to a few intimates\nB that the wedding would occur the first week in\nB December. It was a quiet affair solemnized at\nB the apartments of Mr. and Mrs. Dunn in Stanford\nB court and Mr. and Mrs. Keyser left shortly after-\nB ward for New York where they will spend, the\nB holidays, returning here in January to occupy\nB the Keyser home on East First South street.\nB The bride is a fascinating little beauty of the\nB younger set who has always enjoyed unusual\nB popularity and Mr. Keyser whose friends are\nM legion in business, club and society circles, is a.\nB young man of sterling worth and ability. He Is\nB the third son of the late Aaron Keyser whose dl-\nB versified interests are being capably managed by\nfl his boys.\n1 The wedding is an ideal sort of an affair and\nH tho welcome that Mr. and Mrs. Keyser will re-\nHj ceive upon their return, will be demonstrative or\nH the favor they are held in by their friends.\nH\nB The wedding of Miss Hazel Edgerton Oswald,\nB daughter of Mrs. Frederick L.

However, that is in\ndicative of real players in stock and anywhere\nelse for that matter, for often those who feel the\ndeepest and whose emotional powers are the\ngreatest, have a highly developed sense of humor,\nand such a play as "Baby Mine" is a diversion\nafter the exactions of sob stuff.\nThe second act in particular is a Joy at the\nhands of the Wilkes people, and sharing the hon\nors with the leads are Clifford Thompson and\nClair Sinclair, while the other members of the\ncompany are excellent in minor parts. ,\na.\nU FRIEND LOEB TAKES PEN IN HAND\nI The following communication from Sam Loeb\nrecently added a little sunshine to a gray Decem\nber day, and as usual with such communications,\nthe main point of his argument Is based on who\n\' has the most money.\nWhat is it Nellie V.

He became\ninspired with the moral mission and the power of\nH the story and determined to put it on the stage.\nH It was a long, heart-breaking fight that fol-\nlowed. He met obstacles at every step, but pa\nH tlence and hard work triumphed and at last he\nH secured a house.\n1 The world knows what happened then. The\n1 country was swept with the dramatic sensation.\nH The evil of secrecy about a great scourge was\nH torn away and the truth was told openly, frankly\nH and publicly for the first time.\n1\nHl THE ELKS\' MINSTRELS\nHi\nH On account of the great amount of good the\nH Elks do in their various charities which are not\nB confined to the mention made of them whenever\nH they gave a public entertainment for some worthy\ncause, many of the members often going down in\nH their own pockets to make up for charity func3\nH when such funds are a little short, it is scarcely\nH the province of anyone to be too critical regard-\nh ing the Elks\' Minstrels. In other words one is\nH expected to lie gracefully because of the worthy\nH cause and for the further reason that all con-\nH nected with the show have worked so hard and\nH faithfully to make it the success it was, and flnan-\ncially, it was a success. Artistically it was not,\nH though there were half a dozen bright spots in\nH the production that made up for much of the\n1 remainder.\nH "While there were some specialties and musical\nnumbers that pleased all but the hypercritical,\ncertain parts of the performance should have been\neliminated, particularly the vulgarisms that were\nallowed, and it would have vastly added to the\npleasure of the entertainment if the director had\nconfined ljis efforts to directing and had refrained\nfrom an attempt to be the principal comedian be\nsides roaring like the Bull of Bashan upon all\noccasions.\nThere is no one who is not in sympathy with\nthe Elks in their splendid charity work, but after\nanother year rolls around and they are ready to\ngive another minstrel show, in making their prep\narations they should remember that their audi\nences are also entitled to some charity.\n"KICK IN"\nNo other play thus far produced by the Ernest\nWilkes Stock company will afford Miss Bryant\nand Mr. Hackett the opportunity to display their\ntalent as will the Willard Mack play "Kick In,"\nwhich opens Sunday night.

Her role requires a wonderful\n; transformation from the neglected wife to a gay\nsociety butterfly and Miss Dean enacts it with\nthorough artistry.\nMiss Dean is said to have the most winning\npersonality of any woman who has deserted the\nspeaking stage for the screen. At the studios she\nf always finds a ready audience of girls to listen\nto her recital of the secrets of stagecraft and\nshe seems to be happiest when helping someone\nelse on the road to success.\nIn "Matrimony" she finds an excellent vehicle\nfor her versatility.\nMable Nowman appears with Raymond Hitch\ncock in the comedy, "Stolen Magic," on the same\nbill with "Matrimony."\nIn "The Broken Law," the Rex feature which\nis scheduled for presentation at the Rex theatre\nfor the first three days of this week, beginning\nwith the Sunday matinee, William Farnum as\ncast as Daniel Esmond, an English literateur, who\nloving the freedom of the open way, joins a gypsy\ntribe and because of personal worth is chosen na\ntheir chief. Esmond has received a strange re\nquest from his dying father who years before had\nbetrayed a young gypsy maid and then cruelly\ndeserted her and her baby girl. This wronged\nwoman and child the father commanded Daniel\nto find.\nThe only clue to their identity is a ring with\nthe Esmond signet, given to the woman by her\nlover. Strangely enough this woman is a mem\nber of the same tribe that is joined by Esmond.\nHer mother, dying has told the girl her story and\nthe film play deals with the startling incidents\nthat follow.\n"THE BATTLE CRY OF PEACE"\nA great lesson was shown in the above named\npicture, an adaptation by President J.

The keynote of the picture is\npeace with preparedness and power behind that\npeace, and shows how inadequate are our defenses\nand what could be done by an enemy\'s fleet in\nNew York harbor.
