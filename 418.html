        <pre>['Einstein Theory Modified by Recent\nExperiments\nBy WATSON DAVIS\nManaging Editor, Science Service, Washington, D. C.\nHOW this universe of ours it put to\xad\ngether is always an interesting and \nimportant problem, whether it be \nconsidered by the astronomers who deal \nwith stars and planets or by physicists who \nstudy atomic nuclei and electrons, which, \nexcept in size, are nearly analogous to \nplanetary systems. The cosmos and man, \nthese two subjects always intrigue man, \nand it is therefore fitting that at the many- \nscientific meetings during New Year’s \nweek there should have been interesting \nand noteworthy contributions relating to \nman and the universe in which he lives.\nThe scientific paper that among the \nthousands delivered at the meeting of the \nAmerican Association for the Advance\xad\nment of Science at Kansas City was ad\xad\njudged the most notable contribution to \nscience dealt with a problem that is funda\xad\nmental to the Einstein theory. The annual \n$1,000 prize was awarded to Dr. Clayton \nC. Miller of Case School o f Applied \nScience, Cleveland, for his reports and ex\xad\nperiments on the ether drift. The Einstein \ntheory of relativity may be modified, but \nis not necessarily overthrown, by the re\xad\nsults of his painstaking and difficult ex\xad\nperiments to determine whether or not the \nether, pervading all space and matter, is \ncarried along with the earth. Dr. Miller \nfound that the ether does drift slightly \nwith the earth, much as a person’s hand \ndragged through water carries some of the \nwater along with it.\nWhether or not this luminiferous ether, \nthe stuff through which light moves, trav\xad\nels with the earth or other material ob\xad\njects in the universe may seem to be of \nlittle consequence to the ordinary person, \nbut in reality it is a very important ques\xad\ntion to those scientists who have been prob\xad\ning into the depths of matter and the uni\xad\nverse during the last few decades. The \nether drift experiment of Michelson and\nMorley, as it is known, which when per\xad\nformed in 1887 seemed to show that the \nearth does not carry along the ether to any \ndegree, was used as one of the foundations \nof the now famous “ special”  relativity \ntheory developed by Einstein. For over \nthirty years Dr. Miller, at first in collabora\xad\ntion with Professor Morley and later alone, \nhas been repeating this crucial experiment, \nconstantly refining it and eliminating in\xad\nstrumental errors. He has now announced \nthat as a result of over 100,000 separate \nreadings performed under the most trying \ncircumstances in 1925, it has been deter\xad\nmined that in effect the earth does drag the \nether less on top of high places than near \nsea level.\nThis result necessitates the introduction \ninto the equations of the Einstein theory \nthe idea and factor that light does not, as \nthe Einstein theory basically maintains, \ntravel with the same velocity, no matter \nwhat medium it is passing through. If the \nEinstein theory survives the grafting of this \ncorrection upon it, if after its equations \nhave been modified they still account for \nthe shift o f spectral lines, the displacement \nof light as it passes the sun, and the dis\xad\ncordance of motion of the perihelion of \nMercury, all tests that have won the Ein\xad\nstein theory the support of the scentific \nworld, then it will survive. If not, it must \nperish as many good theories have in the \npast; provided, of course, that future ex\xad\nperiments similar to Dr. Miller’s bear his \nout.\nDr. Miller’s researches are an outstand\xad\ning example of the persistence, patience \nand labor that scientists must often per\xad\nform in their search for the truth. His \nfirst experiments were made in 1895, when \nhe first reperformed the Michelson-Morley \nexperiment of 1887. Ever since then he \nhas been at work on this problem, report\xad\ning little but working much. Several types\n710\n', "EINSTEIN THEORY MODIFIED BY RECENT EXPERIMENTS 711\nWide World l'liotos\nDr. R. A. Millikan o f the California Institute of Technology, w ho \nhas recently m ade im portant discoveries in radiation, photo\xad\ngraphed while engaged in laboratory work\nof interferometers —  in\xad\nstruments to measure \nwhether light will travel \nfaster in one direction \nthan in another— were \nbuilt and tried. Dr. Mil\xad\nler explains that the ob\xad\nservations must be made \nin the dark and at out- \nof-doors temperature, \nand that the observer \nhas to walk around a \ncircle about twenty feet \nin diameter, keeping his \neye at the moving eye\xad\npiece o f the telescope at\xad\ntached to the interferom\xad\neter, which he must be \ncareful not to touch.\nMeasurements must be \nmade under such trying \nconditions for twenty to \nthirty minutes at a \nstretch. The ether drift \ndiscovered by Dr. Miller \nis slightly less near sea \nlevel than it is at Mount \nW i l s o n  Observatory, \nwhere most of the experi\xad\nments were performed.\nBut this minute difference fits into astro\xad\nnomical observations, since slightly differ\xad\nent star locations have been observed at ob\xad\nservatories of different altitudes, and these \ncan be explained by the slight difference in \ndrift noted.\nIf Dr. Miller’s experiments seem to \nshake the foundations of the relativity \ntheory, Dr. Charles E. St. John of Mount \nWilson Observatory presented reassuring \nevidence when he told how the sun sends \npro-Einstein news to earth. Light sent out \nfrom the celestial inferno has a slightly \ndifferent wave-length from that produced \non earth. One of the reasons for this is \nthat there appears to be a slowing up of \nthe atomic clock in the sun in an amount \npredicted by the theory of generalized \nrelativity.\nAs a by-product of his experiments on \nether shift, Dr. Miller announced that the \nearth and the whole solar system is rushing \nheadlong into the Dragon of the sky, the \nconstellation Draco, at the immense speed \no f at least 125 miles a second, perhaps\nmore. His estimate of the speed of the \nsolar system through space is ten times \ngreater than that hitherto considered pos\xad\nsible and it means that the earth is moving \nthrough the universe some seven times \nfaster than it moves in its annual orbital \njourney around the sun. This immense \nspeed of the solar system through space \nmay be in part the motion of our entire \ngalaxy through the ether, Prof. F. R. Moul\xad\nton of Chicago pointed out in his address \nbefore the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science. The great uni\xad\nverse of stars in which our sun is an \naverage star and our earth but a pebble \nof sand is actually traveling through space, \nand at long, long, long intervals, as meas\xad\nured by man, it approaches closer to an\xad\nother universe with awesome consequences.\n“ If a galaxy were left alone,”  Professor \nMoulton said, “ it would undergo a long \ndynamical evolution and would tend to\xad\nward a state in which the stars would be \nsymmetrically arranged in concentric lay\xad\ners. Our galaxy has not arrived at that\ni\n", '712 CURRENT HISTORY, FEBRUARY, 1926\nstate, for it now consists of great streams \nand clouds of stars, somewhat irregularly \ndistributed. This does not mean that it \nwas created recently, in the astronomical \nsense of the term, but that it has encoun\xad\ntered in recent astronomical time another \ngalaxy which has spun it out into a vast \ndisc-like mass, which yet contains numer\xad\nous irregularities.”\nA  V a s t  Ga l a x y\nThe largest organism, whose evolution* \nhas ever been considered, our galaxy, was \nalso described by Professor Moulton. “ Our \ngalaxy consists o f at least a thousand mil\xad\nlion suns,”  he said, “ each one like our \nown, averaging a million times the volume \nof the earth. These suns occupy a disc-like \nor watch-shaped region in space, whose \nthickness is the distance light travels in \nabout 30,000 years, and light travels 186,- \n000 miles per second. The longer diameter \nof the galaxy is about 200,000 light years. \nThe stars of this galaxy move around \namong one another something like bees in \na swarm.* This does not mean that they \ndart quickly from one side to the other, for \nalthough our sun is moving at the rate of\n400,000,000 miles per year, the distances \nbetween the stars are so vast that its rela\xad\ntions to other suns have not changed appre\xad\nciably in historical times. When one sun \npasses near another sun, any planets that \nthey may have had are destroyed, and new \nones begin to be developed from their dis\xad\nintegrated remains and materials which \nmay be ejected from the suns themselves. \nOur earth and the seven other planets of \nthe solar system had their birth when our \nsun last passed near another star, which \nwe know from the distribution of radioac\xad\ntive materials in our rocks, was at least \ntwo thousand million years ago. Our pres\xad\nent planets will be destroyed in some re\xad\nmote future when our sun again passes near \nanother star. This catastrophe will prob\xad\nably not happen for hundreds or perhaps \nthousands o f millions of years to come. \nWe only know that on the average our sun, \nor any other star, will pass near another \nmember of the galaxy once in about 1,000,- \n000,000,000,000 (one quadrillion) years.. \nThis is in round numbers the average life- * \ntime of a family of planets,”\n“ Science has not only created our civili\xad\nzation,”  Dr. J. McKeen Cattell, one of \nAmerica’s leading psychologists, said in \nhis address as retiring President of the \nAmerican Association, “ it has given to it \nthe finest art and the truest faith. The \nadvancement of science should be the chief \nconcern of a nation that would conserve \nand increase the welfare o f its people.”  \nLooking upon civilization as a psycholo\xad\ngist, Dr, Cattell sees that the productivity \nof the nation could be more than doubled, \nand the happiness,, o f individuals could be \ncorrespondingly increased i f  each person, \nfrom the President down to the lowliest \nmoron, were selected by psychological \nmethods for the work he can do best. “ If \nthe best children were born, and only \nthey,”  he added, “ the welfare of the world \nwould he advanced beyond the reach of \npractical imagination.”  The practical ap\xad\nplication of psychology to make the world \na better place to live in does not lie alto\xad\ngether in the future, for Dr. Cattell told \nhow psychological tests are being used to \nselect taxicab drivers and how Secretary \nof Commerce Hoover’ s highway safety con\xad\nference is planning to use laboratory tests \nin formulating a nation-wide system for \nregulation of automobile traffic and \nlicenses. He continued: “ In every Held of \nactivity, from tbe use of pick and shovel, \nof typewriter and ledger, through the fac\xad\ntory and office to the organization of the \nwork of the Executive or the Congress of \nthe nation, investigations might he made \nwhich, if put into effect, would add 10 to : \n100 per cent, to effective productivity and \nlessen to an equal extent effort and fa\xad\ntigue.”\nDr. Cattell revealed that psychologist’s \nhave discovered at what age various things \ncan he best learned or done. He said: **A \nchild can learn to pronounce his own or a \nforeign language best at the age of about \nthree years, after about twelve years he \ncannot learn correct enunciation. Perhaps \na hoy can learn to ride a bicycle best as \nthe average age of ten, to drive a motor \ncar at the age of sixteen. Our ibost orig\xad\ninal ideas come in the early twenties. Some \nof us hope that ability to form correct \njudgments improves until at least the age \nof sixty-five. Three general classifica\xad\ntions of people have been made by Dr. Cat\xad\ntell and, though they often blend one into.\n', 'EINSTEIN THEORY MODIFIED BY RECENT EXPERIMENTS 713\nthe other, every one can fit himself or be \nclassified with, profit to his material suc\xad\ncess and happiness into one or another of \nthese types: Those most satisfied and com\xad\npetent when dealing with personal and \nemotional relations, whether the poet or \nthe salesman; those best fitted to deal with \nmaterial objectives and definite situations, \nwhether the military leader or the me\xad\nchanic; those happiest and most efficient \nwhen dealing with abstractions, whether \nwith the Deity or the atom or simply with \nwords and figures.\nT e st s  f o r  M u s ic a l  A b il it y\nThe Schumann-Heinks and Kreislers of \nthe future will be discovered in the labora\xad\ntory of the experimental psychologist. Ro\xad\nmantic tales of the past, wherein a princely \npatron by chance hears a ragged child sing\xad\ning and adopts her to make her fortune and \nfame, will have to be supplemented by \nothers, wherein a professor finds great \nmusical talents latent in some mute in\xad\nglorious young Caruso who does not even \nsuspect that he can sing at all. This is be\xad\ncause psychologists have been devising \nmethods for the detection of musical ca\xad\npacity, for keeping track of progress in tin \nlearning of music, for the sparing of later \nheartaches to young people without talent \nwho might otherwise waste time and money \non lessons, and for the improvement of the \nuse of the sense of hearing in other things \nbesides music.\nProfessor Carl E. Seashore of the State \nUniversity of Iowa at the American Asso\xad\nciation, demonstrated by means of ap\xad\nparatus, motion pictures and phonograph \nrecords, the methods now in use for the \nmeasurement in prospective students of \ntheir sensitiveness to changes in pitch, in \nrhythm, in harmony, and in all the other \nfundamental elements out of which music \nis built. He showed how some students \nhave ears sensitive to changes of a hun\xad\ndredth of a tone or less, while other unfor\xad\ntunates can not distinguish differences as \ngreat as quarter tones. It is not intended \nto make the whole selection and training of \nstudents a mechanical matter. “We have \nnot sought a closed system for examination \nof musical talent,” Professor Seashore said. \n“We rather advocate that the examiner\nshould take the same attitude the physician \ndoes, that is, first make certain fundamen\xad\ntal tests to see if there is anything wrong \nand then follow up clues for intensive ex\xad\namination of any factor that may be indi\xad\ncated.\nThe teachers at one school of music are \nnow making use of psychological methods \nwith great success; and they find that there \nis close agreement between the results of \nthe old method of rating by experts after a \nconsiderable time of observation and the \nnew method of taking fundamental tests in \na few hours.\nOne of the laboratory instruments is \nknown as the tonoscope. Those who sing \nin front of it see instantly the pitch of the \nsound with an accuracy of a fiftieth of a \ntone. Some enterprising person can well \nbuild up a great and profitable practice \nand the gratitude of the public by taking \nsingers who flat and continue to flat, stand \nthem up before the tonoscope and train \ntheir ear with the eye. They see the error \nthat they make and are forced every \nmoment to correct and thereby gain a new \norientation of the ear.\nN ew  P r e s id e n t  o f  A s s o c ia t io n\nProfessor Liberty Hyde Bailey, the vet\xad\neran apostle of the country life movement \nin America, will serve as President of the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement \nof Science this year. For more than forty \nyears Professor Bailey has devoted his \nenergies to the promotion of agricultural \nresearch and the popularization of its re\xad\nsults. Being gifted with literary and ar\xad\ntistic talents, he was able to present scien\xad\ntific knowledge in a way to attract and in\xad\nterest the general reader. During the \ntwenty-five years that he had charge of \nthe Department of Horticulture and the \nCollege of Agriculture of Cornell Univer\xad\nsity he developed new and more practical \nmethods of training students and reaching \nthe public through press and platform. He \nhas written more than thirty volumes, be\xad\nsides innumerable bulletins and magazine \narticles. His encyclopedias of horticulture \nand agriculture are the standard works in \nthese fields. In addition, Professor Bailey \nhas also been elected President of the In\xad\nternational Botanical Congress, which will \nmeet at Ithaca next Summer.\n', 'Armies and Navies of the World\nT h e  U n it e d  S t a t e s\nT\nHE recommendation by a Congres\xad\nsional committee that extensive im\xad\nprovements be made to Pearl Har\xad\nbor, Hawaii, was the outstanding develop\xad\nment o f the month in the field of national \ndefense. The suggestions were made to the \nHouse Committee on Naval Affairs by \nRepresentative Stephens, as senior member \nof the special Congressional committee \nwhich visited the Hawaiian Islands during \nthe Summer of 1925. He stated that the \ncommittee had conducted a thorough in\xad\nspection o f the Hawaiian defenses and that \nthe proposals were based upon the facts \nlearned by the committee during the in\xad\nquiry. The recommendations were pre\xad\nsented in the form of a report which was \napproved by the whole Naval Committee \non Dec. 21. Among other improvements, \nthe committee urged that Pearl Harbor be \nextended to provide berthing space for six\xad\nteen battleships, that the harbor be straight\xad\nened, that additional piers, sea walls and \ndry docks be erected, and that other im\xad\nprovements be made at an estimated cost \no f 82,218,000.\nThe House Committee on Naval Affairs \nalso recommended that $1,000,000 be spent \non developing the naval base in the Canal \nZone and that a naval pier be constructed \nat San Diego, Cal.\nSecretary of War Davis announced on \nJan. 5 that, to conform with the budget \nlimitations for the year 1927, the War De\xad\npartment would effect a reduction of 4,347 \nin the number of non-commissioned offi\xad\ncers in the army. This reduction will be \nbrought about, not by demotion, but \nthrough the discontinuance of original ap\xad\npointments and promotions, thus leaving \nthe army at its present strength, which is \n118,750.\nG r e a t  B r it a in\nTM PORTANT reductions in the pay of \nofficers commissioned in the regular \narmy were announced by the British War \nOffice. The former normal daily rates of \nfull pay, as laid down in the pay war\xad\nrant o f 1922, and the new normal rates\nof full pay for commissioned officers are \nas follows:\nPresent New\nRates. Rates.\n£ s. d. £ s. d.\nCaptain ..............................  1 3 6 1 1 0\nLieutenant .........................  0 16 0 0 13 0\nLieutenant (after 7 years’\ncommissioned service).. 0 19 0 0 16 0\nSecond Lieutenant.............  0 13 0 0 11 0\nSecond Lieutenant ( present\nrate after 2 years’\nc o m  missioned service;\nnew rate after 3 years). 0 16 0 0 13 0\nThe War Office also announced reduclions\nin the rales of pay for enlisted men. \nThe new normal rale for a private on \nenlistment is two shillings (about 49 cents) \na day, as against two shillings and nine- \npence (about 67 cents) formerly.\nThe new British battleship Rodney was \nlaunched at Birkenhead on Dec. 17. It \nwas announced that the Rodney, which is \nto be commissioned in 1927, is the largest \nbattleship in the world. The estimated cost \nof the vessel is $33,950,000. Under the \nWashington Treaty, the Rodney’s displace\xad\nment is limited to 35,000 tons. It was \nstated that the vessel would probably \nmount nine 16-inch guns in three triple \nturrets, instead of only two turrets as for\xad\nmerly in similar battleships.\nGermany\nTNTERESTING revelations as to the \ncost of the present German pension \nsystem were contained in the budget esti\xad\nmates for 1926, which were made public in \nBerlin on Dec. 22. The estimates for pen\xad\nsions totaled 8440.000,000 for the Reich, \nexclusive of pensions paid by States and \ncommunities. Among the pensioners are \n42,000 ex-army officers, o f whom 1,400 \nbear the title of Marshal or General and \ndraw pensions as high as 86,000 annually. \nThe high cost of the pension system pro\xad\nvoked caustic criticism in the Republican \npress. It was pointed out that the pay\xad\nments were made irrespective of the re\xad\ncipient’s state of health or financial condi\xad\ntion, and that many o f the pensioned\n714\n', 'ARMIES AND NAVIES OF THE WORLD 715\nofficers were men of independent means. \nThe fact that ten years of service, counting \nwartime as double, entitles a German to a \npension, also was emphasized by the \ncritics, who remarked that this provision \nmade it possible for many men, still com\xad\nparatively young, to draw substantial an\xad\nnuities.\nF ran c e\nrT\'HE military needs of France were con- \n"*■ sidered at a conference held in Paris \non Dec. 8 and attended by Prime Minister \nBriand, M. Painleve, Minister of War; \nMarshals Foch and Petain, General De- \nbeney, Chief of the General Staff, and \nGeneral Guillaumat, general officer com\xad\nmanding the French Rhine Army. The \nprinciple subject under discussion was the \nreduction of the effectives of the Army of \nOccupation in the Rhineland. The military \nrepresentatives made a recommendation, \nfixing a minimum below which the effec\xad\ntives should not be reduced. These figures \nwere accepted by M. Briand. Another fea\xad\nture of the conference was the explanation \nby M. Painleve of his plan for the creation \no f a new expeditionary force. This force, \nwhich would be stationed in France, would \nbe kept in readiness for such emergencies \nas arose in Syria and Morocco during 1925. \nThe conference decided to withhold action \non this question until M. Jouvenel, the new \nHigh Commissioner in Syria, had reported \non his recent survey of problems and re\xad\nsources in that State.\nThe Chamber of Deputies on Dec. 23 \napproved the appropriation of 357.000.000 \nfrancs ($14,280,000) for the maintenance\nand development of the Army Aviation \nService during 1926. The proposal, which \nwas also pending in the Senate, had been \nstrenuously opposed by the Socialist Dep\xad\nuties.\nB elg iu m\nrNTEREST in national defense centred \nduring the month upon the recommen\xad\ndation of General Kestens, Minister of Na\xad\ntional Defense, that the army be reduced \nby 5,300 men. General Kestens presented \nhis suggestions to the Chamber of Deputies \nin the form of a bill which set the army \nstrength at 77,000 for 1926. This total, it \nwas explained, would include the troops \nmaintained in the Fourth Occupation Zone \nof the Rhineland. The army, as reorgan\xad\nized and reduced by General Kestens, \nwould be composed as follows: Volunteers \nand re-enlisted men, 18,000; militia, \n54,315; various details, 4,685.\nT u r k e y\nT^URTHER steps were taken by the Turk- \n■* ish Government toward the expansion \nand development of the Air Force. It was \nannounced at Copenhagen on Dec. 7 that \nTurkish representatives had placed an or\xad\nder with the Danish airplane firm of \nMessrs. Rohrbach for fifty duralumin \nsingle-seater fighting airplanes. The ma\xad\nchines, which are to have a wing span of \nabout 36 feet, will be fitted with one 400- \nhorsepower engine each. The engines have \nbeen ordered from the Bayerische Motor \nWerke and will cost about 60.000 marks \ngold (approximately $14,000). It was \nstipulated that the machines be delivered \nwithin twelve months.\n']</pre>
