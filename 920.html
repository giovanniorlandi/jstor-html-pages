We can not and will not re\nturn to that. Is it possible that\nCount Von Hertling does not see\nthat, does not grasp it, is in fact\nliving in his thought in a world\ndead and gone?"\nCount Von Hertling in his ad\ndress to the Reichstag on Febru\nary 26 retorts as follows:\n"President Wilson, who re\nproaches the German chancellor\nwith a certain amount of back\nwardness, seems to me\nview of ideas to have hurried far\nin advance of existing realities."\nThese two quotations illustrate\nfhe difference between the Amer\nican and the German standpoint.\nAmerica does demand some\nin his\nfiling beyond fhe existing nulli\nfies that Germany has created—\ndemands a better day. the observ\nance of the rules of civilization,\nhonorable\nrule of national\nan\nconduct, freedom and justice to\nsmall nations,\nall peoples,\nwhich do not exist today because\nof German kultur.\nt\nGermany insists upon a return\nto and perpetuation of fraud and\ntyranny and ruthlessness, a dis\nregard of justice to small nations,\nindeed to all nations and peoples,\na eonscienceless rule of interna\ntional conduct. These things may\nnot yet be "dead and gone" hut\nthey will he "dead and gone"\nwhen this war is ended.\nThe difference between the two\npositions is the difference be\ntween a future safe and free and\njust, and a, past cruel, unjust,\ntreacherous and tyrannous, the\ndifference between American\nideals and practice and German\nkultur a/nd atrocities.\nTHE THIRD LIBERTY LOAN\nThe campaign for the Third\nLiberty Loan will he opened on\nthe 6th of April, the anniversary\nof the declaration of a state of\nwar between the\nand Germany.\nJr,\nupon further legislation and will\nbe announced\ngress has granted the necessary\npowers.\nSecretary McAdoo\n6th of April as the day to\nthe campaign as the must lilting\ndate to call for a patriotic re\nsponse to the summons to duty\nto every American, to ask from\nthe people at home the same fer\nvent patriotism that actuates\ngallant sons on the battlefields\nof France and on the waters of\nthe Atlantic.\nUnited Stages\nits soon as Con\nchose the\nopen\nour\nHOLD YOUR LIBERTY BONDS\nOne who subscribes for a Lib\nerty Bond and gets credit\npatriot for doing so is not acting\npatriotically if he immediately\nsells that bond, that is, unless he\nimperatively needs the\nsays Secretary McAdoo. It is not\nthe mere subscription that helps\nthe Government, it is the actual\nloan; shifting the bond to\none else docs not help.\nThe same objection lies to ex\nchanging Liberty Loan Bonds in\ntrade. Merchants offering to take\nLiberty Loan Bonds in exchange\nfor merchandise are doubtless\nactuated by patriotic motives,\nbut such transactions tend to de\nfeat a primary object of the bond\nsale, the encouraging of thrift\nand the discouraging of expendi\ntures. Bonds so exchanged\nin most cases immediately sold\non the open market which tend\nto depress the market price and\naffects adversely the sales of\nfuture issues.\nSecretary McAdoo expressly\nslates that there is no desire on\nthe part of the Government to\nprevent or interfere with legiti\nmate trading, in good faith, in\nLiberty Bonds.\nIt is one of the great objects\nof the Treasury Department to\nhave these bonds held aa a per\nmanent investment by the people\nas a\nmoney,\nsome\nare\nand paid for out of savings, thus\nat once providing funds for the\nGovernment and conserving la-,S.\nbor and materia^.\nrhere are the soundest reasons\nfor holding Liberty Bonds. Their\nquotations under par on the stuck\nexchange means a loss only to\nthose who sell. The financial\nhistory of the United States\nshows that in times of peace all\nof ils bonds have gone above par,\nsome as high as 139. The tre\nmendous growth of our resources\nand of our trade, our domestic\ntrade alone having increased\nfrom 930,000,000,000 to $64,\n0 00,000,000 in the last four\nyears, warrants the belief that\nour Government bonds are the\nsoundest investment in the world\nand with the restoration of peace\nconditions will command a hand\nsome premium in the market.\nWHAT TO USE TO\nPREVENT APPENDICITIS\nSt. Maries people should know\nsimple buckthorn bark, glycerine,\netc., as mixed in Adler-i-ka,\nflushes the ENTIRE bowel tract\nso completely that appendicitis is\nprevented.
