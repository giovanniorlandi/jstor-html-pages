Three freanoe and a\npu>w team are cutting out the humps\naud filling in the low places and\nare rapidly leveling the road. As\nsoon as the grading is finished\nwork will be commenced getting a\nlayer of gravel on the road, which\nwill make It passable for heavy\nloads and autos at all seasons of\nthe year. A crew from the state\nhighway engineer\'s office is setting\ngrades and getting of the portion of\nthe state highway that runs through\nthis district and the state highway\nbuaid will soon advertise for bids\ntor the construction work and grad\ning of this stretch. It is estimated\nthat the Job will cost ♦96,006, of\nwhich the district will be liable for\n|60,(M>0 and tbe State ♦20,000. The\ncommissioners have not yet decided\nthat they will put that amount of\nmoney Into one road but tbe matter\nis being investigated\nThe commissioners will also aban\ndon part ol the Grand View road\nand build a new road for some dis\ntance, culling out maintenance of\nse v eral miles by consolidating the\nroads that lead to Bruneau and Grand\nEXPLOSIVES BARRED\nFROM CELEBRATION\nJULY FOURTH IN IDAHO.\nWhereas, It appears especially fit\nting that upon this year of all yeans\nwhen this nation has been forced to\ntake up arms and to do battle to\nsave democracy from destruction, at\ntention should be given to observ\nance of the Fourth ot July, and that\npatriotic meetings aud demonstra\ntions should he held upon that day.\n» and.\nW hereas, The use of firearms and\nother explosive matunals commonly\nused In Fourth of July celebrations\nmight be made the excuse or pre\ntext. of unfriendly persons to have\ndangerous matter iu their possession\nand Mloid an opportunity for Its use,\nin case opportunity for such use\nshould be sought for the destruction\nof life and property in this state.\nNow, Therefore, I, M. Aiexxandcr,\nGovernor of the State of Idaho, do\ncall upon ail citizens everywhere with\nin the Stale to gather together In\npatriotic assemblage upon the Fourth\nday of July to give expression to\nloyalty to the Nation and their de\nvoion to the principles of sell gov\nernment, and 1 do call upon all\nmerchant# and dealer# in explosives,\nfirearms, fireworks and other matter\ncontaining explosive material usually\nused in the celebration of the Fourth\nof July, to refrain from ordering, pur\nchasing of offering for sale any auch\narticles because of tbe danger ac\ncompanying their use, and 1 do call\nupon all Mayors of Cities and Chair\nman of Boards of Trustees of towns\nor villages, all Sheriffs and other\npolice officers within this State to ex\nercise their full power to prevent the\nsale aud use of such articles and\nweapons during the year 1917.\nDone at Boise, the Capitol of the\nState this 5th day of May in the year\nof Our Lord One Thousand\nHundred Seventeen and of the In\ndependence of the United States of\nAmerica the One Hundred and Forty\nPint.\nNine\nM.

This Is a revival of a bit\n,\ncheckered and stormy record of good\nold Mounta n Home in those brave ol4\ndajs when the Kuhns were unrivaled,\nlords in the iirlgatlon realm of Idaho ;\n—and other western states. And this\nof ancient history written into the\ndoes not mean that the scheme is\nwithout merit; on the contrary, com\npetent profiaatonal opinion long"\nsince endorsed it approvingly, the\nonly obstacle bring Its rather magni\nficent prodigality of dollars. None\ntheless officers of the reclamation!\nservice, now In Idaho, are in for a\nca\'l from the league\'s representa\ntives, who*e everlasting and deathless,\noptimlsm will assault with dauntless\ncourage that conservatism which doth\nhedge about the r. s By golly J who\ncan fall of admiration for the dogged\n(not to m ntion the doggone and dad\ngummed) and determined pertinacity\nof those fellows!

The\nre-elected superintendent la not what\none would call the alpha and omega\nof pulchritude—much because of his\nface; still, so\nlady students aiv credited with a tri\numphant issue to a campaign whose\nobject is attained in Spark\'s re-em\nployment In the face of a powtful mi\nnority opposition. And the fact that\nSparks knew nothing of the work Ini\nwe learn, the young\nhis interest until retreat was cut off\nadded zest and humor to the situa\ntion, coo.
