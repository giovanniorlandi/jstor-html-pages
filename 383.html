Not ono person In tbo\ngreat- audlcnco at tho Carneglo hall\nmeeting was in doubt for ono moment\nas to Just what ho meant by every\nthing ho said.\nHis address was comprehensive, logi\ncal, clear and nil sufficient for tbo oc\ncasion. There can bo no dispute as to\nthis. Plainly Mr. Hughes Is a man\nwho "knows what ho wants when he\nwants It," and it is tho opinion of po\nlitical authorities who beard him and\nwho have slnco read bis remarks that\nbo knows also how to get It\nIt was Incumbent upon tho Itepubll\ncan candldato to con0.no tho scopo of\nbis remarks to tho limitations of the\noccasion, but his crushing analysis of\ntho shortcomings of tho present ad\nministration of tho government is\nmerely an earnest of what the tone\nand tho contents of his speeches will\n,bo when bo gets on tho stump.\n.At Carneglo hall Mr. Hughes ad\'\nverted to every general question that\nIs apt to he a serious Issue In tho cam\npaign and In language that will he\nabsolutely clear to every man or wo\nman ablo to read bo stated his opin\nions, his convictions and his purposes.\nOn tbo stump ho will nrguo those\npoints in detail. As an orator he is\neloquent, his personality attractive,\nand his marshaling of facts so co\nhesive that be holds his audience to\ntho end. nc makes It cosy for them\nto follow him, and his points are not\nlost\nThere "was nothing equivocal, noth\ning apologetic In the Republican can\ndidate\'s speech of acceptance. He\ncalled a \'spado a spade, and tho unani\nmous opinion of thoso who heard him\nwas that he shot to the center and\nrang tho bell. Tho Itepubllcan cam\npaign is now open, and thoso who will\nspeak and writo and work for tho suc\ncess of the Itepubllcan ticket can wish\nfor no more adequate campaign docu\nment, no moro satisfactory statement\nof issues than aro found in tho candi\ndate salutatory.\nDUTY OF THE ADMINISTRA\nTION TO STOP PLOTS AND .\nCONSPIRACIES.\nWo denounco all plots\' and\nconspiracies in tho Interest of\nany foreign nation.. Utterly in\ntolerable Is the uso of our soil\nfor alien intrigues. Every Amer\nican must unreservedly con\ndemn them and support every\neffort for their suppression. But\nhero also prompt, vigorous and\nadequate measures on tho part\nof tho administration were need\ned. There should have been no\nhesitation, no notion that it was\nwlso and politic to delay. Such\nnn abuse of our territory de\nmanded immediate and thor\noughgoing action. As soon as\nthe administration had notlco of\nplots and conspiracies it was Its\nduty to stop them. It was not\nlacking in resources. Its re\nsponsibility for their continu\nance cannot ho escaped by tbo\ncondemnation of others. From\nMr. Hughes\' Speech of Accept\nance. PROMISE TO REDUCE THE\nCOST OF LIVING\nNOT KEPT.\nOur opponents promised to re\nduco tho cost \'of living. This\nthey have fatlod to do. But thoy\ndid rcdueo tho opportunities of\nmaking a living.

We know\nthat the recurrence of war Is not to be\nprsvented by pious wishes..\nWa denounce all plots and conspira\ncies in the interest of any foreign na\ntion. Adequate preparedness la not mili\ntarism. ,\nDuring this critical period the only\ndanger of war has lain in the weak\ncourse of the administration.\nThe nation has no policy of aggres\nsion toward Mexico.

Thoso\nwho demanded mora adequate\nforces were first described as\n"nervous and excited." Only\nabout a year and a half ago we\nwere told that the question of\npreparedness was not a pressing\none; that tho country had been\nmisinformed. Later, under tho\npressure of other leadership, this\nattltudo was changed. Tho ad\nministration, It was said, had\n"learned something," and itmado\na belated demand for an In\ncreased army. Even then tho\ndemand was not prosecuted con\nsistently and tho pressure ex\nerted on congress with respect\nto other administrative measured\nwas notably absent\nWo aro told that the defects re\nvealed by tho present mobiliza\ntion aro duo to tho "system." But\nIt was precisely such plain de\nfects that under tho constant\nwarnings of recent years, with\ntbo whole world intent on mili\ntary concerns, should havo been\nstudied and rectified. Tho ad-\nV ministration has failed to dis\ncharge its responsibilities. Ap\nparently It Is now seeking to\nmeet political exigencies by its\nnaval program. But It has im\nposed upon the country an In\ncpmpetent naval administration.\nFrom Mr. Hughes\' Speech of\nAcceptance.\nEVER FORGET ANYTHINGf\nMAINTENANCE OF\nAMERICAN RIGHT8.\nHad this government by tha\nuse of both Informal and formal\ndiplomatlo opportunities left no\ndoubt that when we said "strict\naccountability" we meant pro\n- cisely what we said and that wa\nshould unhesitatingly vindicate\nthat position I am confident\nthat there would havo been no\ndestruction of American lives by\nthe sinking of the Lualtania.j\nThere wo had ample notice in\nfact, published notice. Further\nmore, we knew the situation, and\nwa did not require specifio no\ntice. Instead of whittling away\nour formal atatements by equiv\nocal conversations, wa needed\nthe straight, direct and decisive\nrepresentations which every dip\nlomat and foreign office would\nunderstand. I believe that in\nthis way we should havo been\nspared the repeated assaults on\nAmerican lives. Moreover, a firm\nAmerican policy would have been\n\'strongly supported by our people\nand tho opportunities for the de\nvelopment of bitter feeling would\nhave been vastly reduced.

Hughes\nwould prove to be a cold propoaltion and therefore easy to beat are In for\na shock that will make them think they have been hit by an uninsulated\ntrolley wire. There le nothing cold about Mr. Hughes, Detroit hae learn\ned. He is about as intensely human a piece of humanity ae ever captured\nthe hearta of a crowd, and the more people In the United States he meets\nbetween now and November the more votes will be cast for him. As a\ncampaigner he ie a revelation. He likee hie fellow beinge, and they Ilka\nhim because tHey eee he likee them.\nAnd what his personality begine hie remarkable powera of Intellect\nand utterance finish. He drives his points home with tremendous force.\nWhat he says sticks. There are thousands of Americans today who can\nretell every etep In the arguments he made eight years ago on the Bryan\ntrust policy, yet in 1903 Mr. Hughes was not especially a promlnsnt figure\nand therj was no particular reason why his address more than others\nshould have remained clearly in the memory except the gift of the man to\neend hie own thoughte eo deep Into the brains of others. They are clear\nin his own mind first, undoubtedly. He knows precisely what he wante to\nsay because he has reasoned it out before he speake It out. Probably that\nhas something to do with the ease with which he conveye hie meaning.\nBut it le a very rare quality he possesses in his ability to master subjects\nso thoroughly as to make the most abstruse simple to himself and hie\nhearers. It Is a quality eminently desirable in a political candidate. It le\nInfinitely more to be desired in the president of a great country like the\nUnited States.\nDetroit\'s impression of Charles E. Hughes is ail favorable. The thou\nsands of people who have studied him at close range are convinced that\nIf he Is elected presldont next November he will be a great president, one\nof the greatest this nation has known, worthy to stand In history with\nGeorge Washington and Abraham Lincoln, a custodian of the republic\'e\nfate to whom that fate may confidently be Intrusted. If that conviction\nhi ehared by the people of other states whom he is still to meet the out\ncome of his swing around the great American circle cannot fail to be pro\npitious for him. Detroit Froo Press.\nBLOODY PROSPERITY.\nNo one disputes a temporary prosperity in our land today. But It Is\neectlonal In its factory aspect, abnormal In Its fovered rush, fictitious In\nIts essentials and perverting In its tendency. Worse; it is the gold\neluiced from tho river of blood, poured out by tho horrifying sacrifice of\nmillions of our fellow men.
