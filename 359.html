The;\nRobinson child was placed in the]\nrear seat of the machine when!\nthe automobile started.\nThe machine gained momen-!\nturn as it traveled. It struck a\ntelephone pole shortly after it]\nhad started, swerved and struck |\na house, swerved again and ran I\ninto the river. It turned over in\nthe water taking the child under!\nwith it David Flynn, a by-1\nstander dived for the child twice\nfinally rescuing it uninjured, ex\ncept from a bruise on the chin. \'\nParkersburger Killed in Auto\nAccident\nParkersburg, July 15.—Cecil\nFitzhugh, 29, general bookkeep\ner of the First National Bank of\nthis city, was instantly killed and\nMisses Kathyrn and Viola Elliott,\ndaughters of Adjutant-General\nElliott of Charleston, Miss Janie\nJackson of this city, Davidson\nHall of Clarksburg and Harley\nMcVey of this city were serious\nly though not fatally injured\ninjured when a six passenger\nautomobile drived by McVey\nwent over an embarkment and\nturned turtle about a mile east\nof this city last night.\nThe overturned automobile\nalignted on the tracks of the\nBaltimore & Ohio railroad and\nthe injured members of the par\nty were thrown in the middle of\nthe track, thereby escaping be\ning fatally crushed.\nFitzhugh, who was killed, was\na lieutenant of the state national\nguard. Miss Jackson, Davidson\nHall and Harley McVey are\nprominently connected. It is not\nbelieved any of the injured will\ndie.\nine macnine was running\nslowly around a sharp curve in a\npaved road. The wheels run\nover the pavement into soft clay\nand the machine skidded, turn\ning over an embarkment and\nlighting square’y on the railroad\ntrack.\nMiss Kathryn Elliott and Mr.\nHall, of Clarksburg, were\nthrown from the machine, but\nthe other four members of the\nparty were caught beneath it.\nMiss Kathryn Elliott had a badly\nbruised leg. Mr. Hall was not\nhurt.\nMembers of the picnic party\nwho were in another automobile\nwitnessed the accident. They\nhastened to render assist\nance. The young ladies went to\na nearby house and summoned\nmedical assistance and the young\nmen placed lights on the rail\nroad track to flag any approach\ning trains. Some time elapsed\nbefore those pinned under the\nautomobile were released. It\nwas necessary to secure a jack\nbefore the big car could be rais\ned. Lieut Fitzhugh was dead\nwhen the car was upturned. He\nwas caught between the front\nseat of the machine and a rail\nroad rail and his breast was\ncrushed. None of the other\nmembers of the party were bad\nly hurt it developed when a\ncomplete examination had been\nmade by physicians.\nWilson Wins Victory\nWashington, D. C., July 15.\nRepresentative of the forty five\neastern railroads on which con\nductors and trainmen voted to\nstrike for higher wages, and\nmanagers of the railroads,\nagreed at the White House today\nto submit their differences to ar\nbitration under the provision of\nthe Newland-Clayton act which\nPresident Wilson and congres\nsional leaders promised to make\na law by tomorrow night.\nMeanwhile no strike will be de\nclared. The officials of the em\nployees of the brotherhood of\nconductors and railway train\nmen having agreed on armistic\nuntil Wednesday night.\nThis victory for arbitration\nover strike was the result of a\ntwo hours\' conference at the\nWhite House between Presieent\nWilson and congressional lead\ners, bofh Republican and Demo\ncrats, the president and manag\ners of the railroad and represen\ntatives of the men.\nThe agreement not only avert\ned a railroad strike generally in\nthe east but smoothed out differ\nences that had arisen in both\nhouses as to the composition of\nthe board of mediation and pro\nvided a permanent commission\nto deal with railroad disputes.\nThe pathway was cleared for\nprompt action in both houses.\nSenator Kern telephoned to the\nWhite House he would have the\nsenators act tomorrow instead of\nThursday as contemplated. Rep\nresentative Clayton announcing\nhe would move to take from the\nspeaker’s table his bill to which\namendments in conformity with\nthe Newlands bill in the senate\nwould be attached.\nThe president later announced\nthat he would sign the measure\nas agreed upon and described the\nconference as simple and satis\nfactory. ” Seth Low, president\nof the National Civic Federation\nwhich has been instrumental in\nbringing the railroad heads and\nlabor leaders together, acted as\nspokesman for both sides, rela\nting to the president the details\nof the legislation that had arisen\nin an attempt to provide a sub\nstitute for the Erdman act.\nThe perfected bill will create\nthe United States board of medi\nation and conciliation to be com\nposed of a commissioner of medi\nation and a commissioner ap\npointed by the i esident with the\nconsent of the senate with a sal\nary of $7,500 and a tenure of\nseven years and not more than\ntwo other officials of the govern\nment appointed by the president\nwith the consent of the senate\nwho shall be designated by him\nas two other members of the\nboard. There will also be an as\nsistant commissioner with a sal\nary of $5,000 authorized to act in\na commissioners absence.\nFor the settlement of contro\nversies which might arise the\nmeasure would provide for a\nboard of arbitration of six, three\nmembers to be selected with the\nboard of mediation and concilia\ntion whenever necessary. Later\nthe board would pass upon any\ndisagreement among the arbi\nters. Awards made by the board\nwould be executed by the feder\nal court from which appeals\ncould be made.\nPresident Wilson expressed\nhimself pleased that an agree\nment had been reached. He de\nclares the Erdman act originally\ncontemplated a controversy be\ntween single railroads. He re\nferred to the suggestion made as\njust and reasonable.”\nThe president said he would\nname the members of the new\ncommission as quick as possible.\n“We have until Wednesday\nnight in which to effect an ami\ncable settlement,” said Mr. Gar\nrettson. “We are willing to\navail ourselves of every means\nfor a reasonable settlement.\nShould Congress fail to act then\nthe entire subject will be referr\ned to the committee of one\nthousand for action.”\nThought Strychnine was Candy\nFairmont, July 15.—Little Dor\nis Kathleen Stretchberry, aged\nfour, is dead, as the result of\neating strychnine tablets, which\nshe secured t rom the kitchen\ncabinet when in quest of sugar.\nThe child, who was the daughter\nof Harland Stretchberry, of Nor\nwood, a few miles from the city,\nasked her mother for sugar.\nThe mother told her to climb\non a chair and get it from the\ncabinet. The child instead of se\ncuring sugar, found a box con\ntaining strychnine tablets and\nate ten or twelve from the box.\nThe mother seeing the empty\nbox on the floor, inquired con\ncerning it, and when told by the\nchild she had eaten the contents,\nat once gave her an emetic and\nsummoned a physician. When\nthe physician arrived the child\nwas past help and died early this\nmorning. She was an only child.\nThe mother was a daughter of\nWilliam Bunner, of this county,\na prominent citizen.\nCard of Thanks\nA card of thanks to the many\nfriends of R«>ad Run and sur\nrounding community for their\nkind courtesy, and earnest care\nand help during the sickness\ndeath and burial of our dear\nmother, Mrs. Vashtie Roberts.\nThe Children.\nWill Change Road For Orma\nBridge\nKnowing that many of our\nreaders are interested in the\nbuilding of the new bridge across\nthe West Fork at Orma, we are\nprinting in full the report of the\nviewers appointed by the county\ncourt to mark out the road to the\nbridge, The court will receive\nbids on erection of the bridge at\na future term of court, and bids\nfor both concrete and steel con\nstruction will be asked for. The\nreport of the viewers is as fol\nlows:\nWe. G. Johnson, G. L. Lynch\nand Edwin Starcher, viewers\nheretofore appointed by the\nCounty court of Calhoun county,\nW. Va., having been appointed\nas such to view and locate a pub\nlic bridge and road to and from\nsame, across the West Fork, at\nOrma, below the forks of said\ncreek in said county, did on the\n27th day of June, 1913, go upon\nthe proposed site for said im\nprovements and view and survey\nsame. We recommend that the\nproposed road leading to said\nbridge bop-in at the public road\nleading down the West Fork be\nlow the forks and on the right\nbank S. 221-2 W. 20 feet to\nfirst pier for bridge, thence S.\n22 1-2 W. 80 feet crossing said\ncreek to opposite pier on proper\nty line between L.

Stalnakers store build\ning, said proposed road and\nbridge would pass over and upon\nlands of L. J. Groves schoolhouse\nlot and W. A.

Johnson.\nG. L. Lynch.\nEdwin Starcher.\nUpon the consideration of this\nreport it was ordered that the\nsaid road as located by the view\ners, be established as a public\nroad.\nThe location of the road on the\nnorth side of the West Fork has\nnot been completed yet, but it is\nthe intention to change the road\nso that the fords at S.

Va., July 15\nJames Herrills is in jail here\ncharged with being the instiga\ntor of the cowardly attack on\npretty Miss Leda Prince during\nwhich her face was cut to rib\nbons by an unknown assailant\nwith a razor. While she is in a\nserious condition it is said, how\never, that she will recover.\nMiss Prince is the daughter of\nMrs. Marshall Clay by a former\nmrrriage.\nHerriH\'s motive, it is charged,\nwas revenge because Miss Prince\nrefused to accept him as a suitor.\nThe police charge the girl’s as\nsailant was a hired assassin in\nthe pay of Herrill. There is no\nclue to the girl\'s assailant as\nHerrill denies any connection\nwith the case.\nMiss Prince was attacked\nwhile walking along the road be\ntween Harper and Eccle3. She\nfought her assailant with the fe\nrocity of a tigress and in the\nstruggle finally succeeded in tak\ning the razor from the man.\nShe tried in turn to wield the\nrazor on him but he escaped.\nDr. J. A. Campbell placed 53\nstitches in the girl\'s face, which\nwill be horribly disfigured. Her\nhands were also badly cut as a\nresult of her efforts to disarm\nher assailant.\n..Oeo OQO—« «■« » « » »■ ———«■« « « »—».»♦ >q\nMAKING THE LITTLE\nFARM PAY\n_ , By C C.

The College now proposes\nto demonstrate to the farmer,\nright on his own farm that alf\nalfa will grow if given the prop\ner treatment.\nTo the first one hundred farm\ners making proper application, a\npackage will be sent which con\ntains alfalfa seed, inoculated soil\nand the necessary fertilizing\nmaterials. When this mixture is\nproperly spread out over one\nsquare rod of well selected and\nwell prepared soil to which ha?\nbeen applied twenty-five pound?\nof lime, every factor for the suc\ncessful growing of alfalfa is\npresent and if the season be at\nall favorable a stand of alfalfa\nshould readily be secured.\nOnly those who are prepared\nto comply with the following\nconditions should make applica\ntion.\nJ. The applicant must own\nand operate the farm on which\nthe alfalfa is to be established.\n2. A plot of ground 1 rod long\nand 1 rod wide or 2 rods long and\none half rod wide must be set\naside in a well drained field or\ngarden where the ground is fair\nly rich.\nThe plot must be situate where\nchickens and stock will not in\njure it.\n4.

I3i:rns Detective Agency\n(Oopyrlttlit by Uio Intortnuloruil l*i.*a Curoau,\nA TRAIL OF INK\nHow a Clever Bank “Kiter” Was Run\nDown on a Slender Clue\nThe National Hunkers’ Protective\nassociation Is un organisation formed\nby the bankers of this country to pro\ntect themselves and the money In\ntheir care Trom the onslaughts of that\nconsiderable class of sharp-witted and\nreckless men who live by “working\nbanks.”\nThis class is divided Into two minor\nclasses—the "rough workers" and the\n"klters.” The former phrase Is used\nin detective parlance to designate the\ngentlemen who travel around the\ncountry and blow bank safes. The\n"klters” are the persons who obtain\nmoney by forgery, raised checks, al\ntered drafts, false Identifications, and\nother misrepresentations. Although\nthe safe-blowers get more space In the\npapers, because of the spectaculur\ncharacter of their achievements, they\nare the least troublesome of these\ntwo types of criminals. A couple of\nyeggmen will blow a safe in a coun\ntry bank in Painted Post, Nob , shoot\nthe town mnrshal in the leg. and get\naway with $5,000, and the press or\nthe country will ring with the news.\nHut all the time there is going on the\nshrewd, silent work or the “kiter,”\nwhich seldom gets Into the papers,\nbut which continually is costing bank\ners and depositors thousands of dol\nlars.\nTo catch a "yeggman”—a safe-blow.\nor—is nothing more or less than\nstraight police work. To catch a\n"kiter” is n problem of intricate do\ntoctlve work, for the "kiter" Is a man\nof brains, where tile "yegg" Is merely\none of force, and the former knows\nbetter than anyone In the world how\nto cover his tracks to escape detec\ntion. There is living in California at\nthe present time an old gentleman\nwho retired on a pension granted him\nseveral years ago bj a combination of\nbankers who calculated that it would\nbe better to pay him to remain honest\nthan to risk losses from his sktllul\nmethods of forgery.\nIt Is hardly likely that banking his\ntory of this country will see such an\nother incident. The National Bank\ners’ Protective Agency employs the\nBurns Detective Agency to do all its\nwork now, and no matter how shrewd\na forger may be, how seientittc his\nmethods, the Burns system, backed by\nthe Bankers’ association, is sure to\nget him in the long run. At the same\ntime there are hundreds of men—\nmostly young fellows in desperate\nllnanclal straits—who tempt fate by\npassing bad bank paper. Such orluv\nInals are soon run to earth, it Is the\nold bclontltlc fox, the man who has\nmade “kiting” a profession, whv\nmakes trouble; and the first one of\nthese gentlemen that I ran down while\nworking as a Burns detective was the\nbest of the lot.\nIn Medillion, N. V., there are throe\nbanks, the Old National, the First Na\ntional and the Farmers’ and Mer\nchants’. One Monday morning tne of\nlice manager of our agency came down\nto the oltico to find on tils desk a tel\negram from each of these hanks re\nquesting that a man be sent up at\nonce.\n“A Job for you, Cornell," said the\nmanager, handing me the messages.\n“Beat it up there ns soon as you can.”\nI caught n Lackawanna train at\n10:30, and at seven In the evening I\nwas registering In the best hotel In\nMedillion, a town of 7,500 people.\nAfter three dajs’ work I had unrav\neled the following tale of what had\nhappened to th\\> banks of Medillion:\nA month before a man named Claw\nson, who conducted the most pros\nperous coal yard of the town, had de\ncided to sell out and retire from busi\nness. He had advertised the sale in a\nretail coal trade publication that cir\nculated among coal dealers through\nout the country. In a few days, or to\nlie precise, Just three weeks before I\narrived in town, a prosperous, ener\ngetic looking man had appeared in an\nswer to the advertisement. He Intro\ni iuced himself as Milton K. Jenkins,\n| said he had been In the coal business\nyears before, In Chicago, had quit It\nand gone to New York, where he had\nbeen working as a coal salesman for\nthe last five years The death of an\nj uncle, said he, recently had placed\nhim In possession of a little money.\nHe wanted to get Into business for\nhimself Ho wanted to got out of the\ngrind and worry of the city. He\nwanted to be his own boss, lie bnd\nbeen In Medllllon once before and\nliked the town. As soon as he had\nseen Clawson\'s advertisement he had\nsaid to his wife, ‘\'There’M the place for\nub, Jennie, If the business is any\ngood,” and had hied himself straight\naway to tbn town.\n“Now,” said he energetically, "show\nme what you\'ve got to sell."\nThe man’s knowledge of the coni\nbusiness was so complete as to na\nture Clawson at once that he was\ntalking to an old and shrewd hand In\nthat line, ills bearing and address\nbad all the earmarks of success and\nforcefulness. He knew how much\ncoal cost at the mines down In i’eiue\nsylvanls, how much freight rates\nwere, and what coal ought to sell for\nIn Medllllon He smiled appreciative\nly when Clawson showed hlrn his\nhooks and demonstrated that the peo\nple ot Medllllon ware willing to pay\neven a little more than what coal\nought to sell for In that town.\n”1 see you know the game, too,” ho\nsaid; and Clawson naturally was a\nlittle flattered.\nClawson named a price of $6,600 on\nhis plant as It lay then, In the eariy\nsummer with little stock in it. This\nwas an unreasonable price, and Jen\nkins said so at once.\n\'Tlve thousand Is the top notch\nprice I ran see myself paying for It,”\nsaid he, and probably $4,600 will be\nwhat it looks Jike when I\'ve looked It\nover carefully.\nClawson grumbled that $5,600 was\nhis only price, but Inwardly he was\npleased. He had set $1,000 as what\nhe expected to realize from his sale\nJenkins began to go Into the de\ntails of the business with him as no\none but a man skilled In that line\ncould do. He covered the field with\nhis investigations and questions in a\nway that aroused Clawson’s admira\ntion.\nj "Mr. Jenkins,” he said, "you can do\ntwice as much business here as I did.\nYou can teach them all something\nabout the coal business.”\n"I know something about it.” ad\nmitted Jenkins. “You haven’t hustled\nquite enough. Don’t you know that\nyou ought to get a couple or tactorles\ninto tills town? I do. I got oui in\nview now that I could bring here pos\nsibly. Hut you\'ll never got $5,5UU out\nof me for your business.”\nFinally ho wrote a check for $_o(j\non the Twenty-fifth Street Hank or\nNew York city lor a live days’ option\nat $.‘>.000.\nAt the same time that ho was dick\nering lor the business Jenkins began\nto make inquiries about a home. Here\nagain his evident character as an ex\nperienced and forceful business ni»>*\nasserted itself.\nClawson, quite convinced that no\n. would make ills file at a price satis\nfactory to himself, eagerly carried\nJenkins over to a real estate man\nnamed Cross and introduced him as a\n| new and valuable addition to the pop\nulation ol Medilllon.\nCross, likewise, was deeply im\npressed by Jenkins. He had no doubt\nof his ability to pay Tor the host\nhouse for sale in town, and Jenkins\nwas at once taken out and shown a\ndesirable property. It was an old\n| homestead with large grounds and In\nK.od repair, and the price was $5,000.\nIt was a fair price. Jenkins agreed\nat once to this, lie went through the\nhouse carefully.\n‘Just about the kind of a place Jen\nnie—my wire—would like,” he said.\n“I’ll get her up to take a look nt it.”\nCress had promptly begun the real\nestate man’s old song: "Well. Mr. Jen\nj 1:1ns, there are two or three other par\ni ties interested in this property, and 1\n| expect an offer for it almost any mo\ni ment. If you want—”\n"Anybody got an option on it?”\nusked Jenkins.\n“No.”\n"Give rao a three day option on it\nfor $200,” said Jenkins. "I\'d closo\nwith you now, but my wife always\nwants a finger in the home pie." He\nwrote a check for |200 on the Twenty\nfifth Street Hank of New York city.\nThe third man in the net wns Flink.\nthe big furniture man of the town.\nHo came In tin* third day, when Mrs.\nJenkins, a prepossessing, well dressed\nwoman, came to town. Hy this time\nthe news had been printed in the\ntown\'s little dally paper that Mr. Jen\nkins of New York was buying out\nClawson\'s coal yard and purchasing\nthe old homestead from Cross for a\nhome. Also, It was rumored, Mr. Jen\nkins was connected with several man\nufacturing enterprises which were\nconsidering Mediliion as a possible lo\ncation\nMrs. Jenkins came into Fllnk\'s Fur\nniture Emporium, and with the good\nnatured assistance of Jenkins began\nto pick out furniture for their new\nhome. She had taste and an appar\nently generous pocketbook. Flink\nrubbed his hands as i)<‘ Raw her pick\nnothing but the most expensive stuff\nin his store. He extended himself to\nplease Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. The bill\nfor the articles that Mrs. Jenkins hud\nBet aside ran up to $1,200.\n"It will he some days before wo\nwant them sent up,” said she. "Hut\nwhen wo do want them it will bo in a\nhurry.”\nA deposit of one hundred dollars\nwas made, and the pair departed. The\ndeposit was In the form of a check on\nthe Twenty-fifth Street Hunk of New\nYork.\nI /il_____• .... . . ...\n\' vi woo miii r mm mil I lull\n(\'lice to their hanks with tHeir checks.\nClawson banked at the Old National,\nCross at the First National, and Fllnk\nat the Fanners\' and Merchants\'. Tho\nchocks were taken for collection—and\nj proved good.\nJenkins made such an impression\nthat the Chamber of Commerce in\nvited him as an honored guest to Its\nweekly meeting. Ho was looked upon\ni a citizen to he welcomed with open\narms. Said the president of tne\n( hamper of Commerce In Introducing\nhim: ’Mr. Jenkins Is what wo need\nand want: a thorough-going hustler."\nHe was. At Iho end of a week’s\n| dickering with Clawson, he agrnrd to\nbuy tho coal yard at $4,760, $2,600 to\nbe paid ut once, and the remainder on\n| six months’ time. He wrote a check\nas before for the $2,600.\n"And by the way, Clawson," he Raid.\n"Wish you’d take me down and In\ntroduce me to your banker. Ill have\nto transfer my account hero In a few\nlays."\nClawson accordingly Introduced\nJenkins to the Old National bank in\na cordial manner. As soon as he had\nbeen pinperly Identified Jenkins pre\nronfed a draft Issued by tho Twenty\nFifth Street bank for $1,626, The\nea-filer paid It without a murmur of\nsuspicion.\nFrom Clawson, Jenkins went to\nCross, and within half an hour he had\nrepeated his operation at tho First\nNational, there cashing a draft for $1,\n610. From Cross he went to Kllnk,\nand Fllnk accommodatingly identified\nhim at the Farmers’ and Merchants’,\nWhere he secured $1,800 on a similar\ndraft.\nThat night Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins left\nMedllllon. Next day the hanks discov\nered that the drafts were all forgeries.\nThe forms on which they wore Issued\nwere mere cheap imitations of the\nTwenty-fifth Street Bank’s paper. Hur\nried telegrams went to the New York\n1\nbank:\n“How much Is Jenkins* balance?"\nThe answer cauie: “Eighteen dol\nlars ami eleven cents.”\nThe Medlllion banks had been clev\nerly stung\nThis was the story that 1 gathered\nthread by thread when I Investigated\nthe trouble In Medlllion.\nTo trace Jenkins I had specimens of\nbis handwriting, excellent descrip\ntions or him. and the knowledge thut\nb* was an expert In the coal bu ineta.\nI Beyond that—nothing. Ho had come\nto Medlllion. stayed a lltth . and nt\nj tod awa> f|,om $*1,136 or the bankers\'\nI money. Ho had left no trull to fol\n, low. lib was a thoroughgoing “klter."\nBack in New York I found (hat Jen\nkins had been u dt posltor ot theTwen\ni t:-fifth Street Bank ror only a short\ni time. Nothing was known of him\nthere. He had left no trace. So far\ni rs anv tr-dl we* concerne«l the exist\nence of Jenkins began with libs ap\npearance at this bank and ended with\nhis disappearance from Medlllion.\nNone of the clumsy little tracks lelt\nby the crude criminal were to l.»\nfound In this case. He had Just come,\nhad got the money, and had gone, lie\nwas an artist.\n“Well,” said Chief Burns, “It looks\nns if a new ‘klter’ had begun work\namong the banks in dead earnest. But\nI’ve seen t:ork that resembles this be\nfore.”\nWe hunted through our records,\naud sure enough, the same methods\n; that had worked in Medlllion had\nbeen used In Michigan about a year\nbefore. A coal man had advertised\nhis business for sale, a prospective\npurchaser had appeared, had estab\nlished his credit, had cashed dralt9\nthrough introductions to the local\nbanks, and had flitted, no ono know\nwhere. And no one had discovered.\nGoing back still further wo found\nthat about a year before another case\nof tho same sort had been reported\nfrom Iowa. This was before the Burns\nagency began to handle the Bankers’\nProtective association\'s business, v, f)\nhunted through all til0 records w«\ncould find, ami as near as we could\nJudge, about once every twelve months\nn man appeared in vr>mr» small town\nplane or Rociety\nTho only physical ; ; oof that I l ari\nof tho existence ot Jctikii.i wan h\nvariously disguised hand-w • iM;T.\nwas tho only trace tl if ho hail left or i\nMs presence.

I bey wore wee’ of searching\nund researching without finding any\nthing. Nothing interesting happened\ni’t that time. But in tho end, alter\nthe weariest suit or ill . 1: :, l unnlly\nunearthed the salient tact that all of\nthe coal men who Imd b> \'ii tho mean j\nor attracting the fatal Jenkins to their\ntowns had advertised tin it* b.i inoss\nf\' : ; tie lu the same coul trade pub\nli atlon.\nThis publlcaflon was a small week\nly Issued at Philadelphia.

Reasoning the\n( th*ng out It seemed Possible to sup\npose that Jenkins for years hud been\na constant reader of t is puper.\nThe case for this lieory summed\nup thus:\nSix certain men bp»i published in.\nthis paper nds offering for > ale a c. .!\n; business, which Jenkins had anweri.!.\n} These particular ads had appoarid\nIn a space covering six years.\nIn three cases at least he hud as\nsorted that he had seen (he advertise\nment in this publication.\nHe was so familiar with u.i the u]>\nto-dato news of tho trade that ho ould\n.hardly have obtained It any other way\nthan rct.i’ing closely trio gossip of a\ntrade paper.\nAgainst thb- uf course was tlie pos\nsibility (hat Jenkins had merely hit\nupon these particular coal yards by\nI accident. At all events, this was tho\n| only clue that 1 had to work on.\nIn Philadelphia I found the publish*\n| er of the coal paper to bo a crabbed\n\' old fellow who would have nothing to\nj do with mo at iirst. I look\' d arourd\nend found that ho was head ovor-hecls\nwnd Funk together. i wired mo\ncashiers of bunks in other towns who\nbud been fleeced by Jenkins. I went\nto Noria, Ohio, n tiny town of 1,6WU\npeople, and got a spot on Cummings.\nHe was n coni merchant—but 1 found\nthat he was frequently absent from\nNertn for weeks at a time. And no\nbody knew where he went on these\noccasions.\nI wired my hankers and the trio in\nMedllllon:\n“Como on to Ncria and look him\nover.”\nThey came as last as trains could\ncarry them. 1 pointed Jenkins out to\nthem as he walked down the street.\nThey recognized him, every man Jack\nof them, as “Jenkins.”\nClawson went up and held out his\nhand.\n“Hello, Jenkins," lie said.\n“You ; ri> ml taken,” was the an*\nwar. “Cummings is my name.”\n‘ If : la ivy,” said Cross, stepping up,\n“but in Aicdilllon it was Jenkins, all\nright."\n»• s." » .Id Flink. “Why didn’t you\ncon.e back for your furniture?”\n• ciuxulhgs—Jenkins—looked around\n" ildly.

The man never had been ap\nprehended or even located, i\'pon In\nvestigating those old cases we found\nthat tho "kitor” always used a dif\nferent name, that lie was sometimes\nshaved, sometimes bearded, some\ntimes splurglly dressed, and soino\ntltnes quietly-- but always ho was a\ncoal man of forceful character and\napparent success, it was obvious that\nho and our "Mr, Jenkins\'* were one\nand the same man.\nA hurried Hitting around the coon\ntry placed In my possession the vari\nous specimens of handwriting that\nhad been left by tho "klter." At hr. t\nI was amazed and disappointed to dis\ncover that they were all apparently\nthe work of different men; but a few\ndays\' work on the part of our li nrl\nwrlflng expert demonstrated that oi «\nman had written them all, but that ho\nhad so skilfully disguise’! his hand on\neach occasion as to make each sped\nmen entirely different In appearance\nfrom the others. My re-pert for my\nquarry grew Immensely at this re vein,\ntion. Tho man was absolutely tho\ncleverest forger I ever had heard of.\nNow I knew that the Jenkins who\nhad fooled the banks In Medlllion was\nan old and expert hand at crime, that\n«e had worked at It Tor at least six\nyears, ami that he seemed to do only\none Job a year. And still I was as far\nAway from any apparent clew as when\nI started on the ease. Somewhere\nIn America this forceful, ciover fel\nlow was living on the proceeds ot bn\ncrime lint what a task to look for\nhim* For this Jenkins was not of\nthe criminal type. He would not he\nfound by hunting among crooks, tie\nmight be anywhere ado in almost any\nin debt, and that Ida bank held two\nnotes against him which tlipy wore\nthreatening to call In, which action\nwould have put the old fellow out of\nbusiness. The president of the bank,\non rny request, wrote a little note, and\nupon Its presentation the publisher\nwas glad to turn over for iny Inspec\ntion all his records. Together with\nthe hand writing expert I set to work\non all the letters that the old man had\nIn the office.\nFortunately the old fellow was of a j\nauspicious habit of mind. Whenever\nanyone sent In nn order for a sub- I\ni scrlptlon he not only placed I he order !\non his books, but tie lllcd away Un\noriginal letter, to produce If the mil*\nsrrfber denied payment. He had over\n2*600 of these letters, and our task\n! van to look at each fine and compare\nthe signatures with the varlofis dis\nguised hand writing;; of Jenkins.
