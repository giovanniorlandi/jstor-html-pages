Holmes Jury Fails to Agree\nand Mistrial is Entered. Peace in\nPanama.\nWashington.■»—The filing of com\nplaints by lumbermen against the\nrailroads of the southeastern territo\nry for the\'recovery of advance charges\npaid subsequent to court decisions de\nclaring the increased rate illegal, has\nbrought into prominence the question\nas to when the Railroad Rate Law ac\ntually took effect.\nAlthough Congress intended that\nthe Rate Law should not become ef\nfective for sixty days after its pas\nsage, that intention was not expressed\nlegislatively until after the Rate Law\nhad been passed and signed by the\nPresident. Some good lawyers declare\nthat the Rate Law was actually in\neffect several hours before the sixty\nday postponement resolution became\nlaw. They claim there was a lapse of\nseveral hours from the time the Pres\nident signed the Rate Bill until the\nresolution was passed and signed.\nFor almost a year it has apparent\nly made little difference whether the\nlaw went into effect on June 29 or\nOn Aug. 28. For practical purposes\nit mad<? little difference so far as the\nCommission was concerned. But now\nit may be brought up officially and\nformally for determination in the\nnear future as to just when the law\ndid go into effect. Even the minutes\nand second figuring in the hour when\nthe President’s signature was at\n: taehed and the exact minute when\nthe resolution postponing the effec\ntiveness of the law for sixty days\nwas signed may become matters of\nk moment.\nThis has been brought jibout toy\nxj. the-fact .that the law\' provides among\nother things, that claims for money\ndamage things, that claims for money\nfiled within one year after the new\nlaw becomes effective. It so hap\npened that within a year after the\nlaw wTas signed the Supreme Court of\nthe United States handed down its\ndecision affirming tlje order of the\nCommission in the YellowT Pine As\nsociation cases. That decision was\n• rendered on Slay 27th, 1907. Under\n\' it the railroads have taken off the\n2 .cent advance in rates. They did\n, thif.on June 20. Immediately after\nward the lumber mill men of the\nSouth and the lumber shippers of that\npart of the country who had all beeri\nwaiting for the Supreme Court de\ncision began to tile claims before the\nCkjiimission for money damages in\naccordance with the ruling of the\nSupreme Court. -.These claims arose\nunder the old law and must be filed\n. within.. a year after the Rate Law\nbefciunaf.effeetive in order to be val\nid1\'i ; -\nIn connection with the filing of\ntMse\'claims ,4 he question has aris\nen las to whether the new Rate Law\nwent into effefit June 29 or on Aug.\n• 28 jd>f ■ last year.\nIfit went into effort on Aug. 28,\nthen \'the lumber mill repara\ntion .claims that are now being filed\nwith five Commission against the rail\nroads are all valid and will be valid\nup to* August 28 of the present year.\nBut if, on the other hand, the rate\nlaw went into effect on June 29, the\nday,that it was signed, then it is a\nmatter for judicial determination as\nto whether the claims filed after June\n29 are valid. Realizing that the ques\ntion would probably be raised the\nInterstate Commerce Commission on\nlast Saturday placed the exact time,\nto the very minute, upon every com\nplaint and petition filed. On that day\nand the preceding one more than 190\nSouthern lumber companies filed\nclaims for reparation aggregating\nover $1,000,000.\n\'h*1", . » —i\n* >" Vacation of Naval Officers.\n\'Admiral Devley is making arrange\nment\'s iotesive Washington for Rich\neW Springs, N.

As the .young men are\nof high caste they could not be sub\njected to such treatment, and the\noutlook seemed desperate until Sec\nretary Wilson proposed that the\nHindus lay aside their American\nclothes and wear the turbans and\nrobes. So attired they are promised\nthe best railroad and hotel accore\nmodations.\nCollection of Turkish Stamps.\nChekib Bey, the Turkish Ministei\nannounced that his government has a\ncollection of 17,000,000 postage\nstamps, which will be sold at auction\nin August, and the proceeds donated\nto the Higaz Railway, which is being\nconstructed from Damascus to Beirut.\nWhen completed the road will he\noperated by a commissioner named\nby the government.\nThe collection stamps consists of\nmore Ilian one hundred denomina\ntions, which have been issued by the\nTurkish government during the last\nforty three years.

Holmes.\nJr., of the Department of Agricul\nture, on the charge of conspiring to\ndefraud the goverent’s by giving out\nth& department’s crop information,\nwas discharged from further consid\neration of the case. Earlier in the day\nthe Jury had made a visit to the\ncourt room in quest. o.f further in\nstructions on the subject of conspir\nacy. Mrs. Holmes was present with\nher husband when the result of tne\njury’s deliberations was reached,\nand shed tears over his failure to so\ncure acqujttal.\nSays Final Adieu.\n"I have been through a great\nmany trying experiences in my life,\nbut the saddest of all, I think is\nleaving ^he United States and the\nmany true friends I have made here.’\nThese were the words of Sir Che\ntung Liang Bheng, the Chinese min\nister, as he sat in the library of the\nlegation chatting with a representa\ntive of the Associated Press, just\nprior to his departure for the rail\nroad station, from which he left for\nthe city of San Francisco, at which\nplace he will sail on the battleship\nKorea, July 9 for home.\nHonduras is NNeutral.\nHonduras is to remain neutral o\'i\nany entanglement in Central Ameri\ncan affairs, according to information\nreceived by Senor Ltgarte, who was\nsent to Washington by Provisional\nPresient Davilla to make an effort\nto secure recognition from the United\nStates government.\n*‘Ti Vine hppn eharced.” said Mr.\nUgarte, “that Davilla is to be but\n*an instrument in the hands of Presi\ndent Zelaya, but this is not correct\nPresident Davilla will act indepen\ndently, and Honduras will remain\nentirely neutral in dealing with Cen\ntral American affairs.\nPeace Reigns in Panama.\nWhat would appear to be a conclu\nsive contradiction of the reports re\ncently published in this country tc\nthe effect jthat the Army officers en\ngaged in the work of constructing\nthe Panama Canal are endeavoring\nto be relieved of their task is con\ntained in the following cablegram, re\nceived at the War Department from\nPanama: -\n“Everything going well and har\nmoniously.

Several days were spent in mak\ning an investigation of the advant\nages to be derived from such an enter\npi-ise and perfecting plans that will\ninterest the people of the United\nStates as well as the world. Every\ndelegate was accorded a full and free\nhearing and the concensus of opin\nion was, that this was the world a\ncomprehensive exhibit of its incom\nparable resources, and that the exposi\ntion should be held. It is generally\nconceded that the completion of this\ngreat canal project will revolutionize\nthe railroad map of the United States,\ndiverting the terminals of great com\nmerce carrying lines from the Atlan\ntic ports to the Gulf ports, and de\nveloping this section at even a great\ner rate than has been experienced in\nthe East. Then it would seem that\nthe Gulf States are soon to see the\ndawn of an industrial and commer\ncial activity and development that\nwill attract to them the eyes of the\nwhole world. The proposition is, to\nhold in New Orleans a gigantic ex\nposition that will show forcibly to\nthe millions of visitors something of\nthe wonderful resources of the Mis\nsissippi Valley and the South. Next\nto Louisiana, and almost if not quite\nthereto, in the way of benefits to be\nderived from this undertaking, is the\nsplendid commonwealth of Mississip\npi. There is considerably more terri\ntory in Mississippi adjacent to New\nOrleans than in Louisiana. The\nSouthern portion of our state is fast\nbeing denuded of its wfealtii of pine\nlumber and the demand is for good\nwhite people who will buy the cleared\nlands, make it produce of the world’s\nneeds as it will do witbv intelligent\ncultivation, and a source of revenue\nto the state before the corroding\nrains make of it a mass of gullies.\nThis is the opportunity for Mississip\npi to forcibly bring to the attention\nof desirable people the fact that Mis\nsissippi offers more to the man with\nbrains and energy than any state in\nthe Union. Then too, the beautiful\ncoast counties of our state have pre\nsented to them an opportunity that\ncomes only occasionally, of attracting\nthereto, multiplied thousands of vis\nitors during the ten months of the\nexposition for a few days or a few\nweeks. A trip to the exposition would\nbe incomplete with a side-trip to\nthe exquisitely beautiful and pleas\nant coast towns of Mississippi. No\nsection of the universe offers more en\nchanting scenes, better bathing, fish\ning or other advantages that go to\nmake a visit pleasant. With a sys\ntematic and aggressive campaign of\nadvertising the coast towns have pre\nsented an opportunity to induce count\nless visitors during the exposition.\nA well-arranged building devoted to\nthat purpose, showing large photo\ngraphs of the beautiful beach, shell\nroads, bathing piers, yachting, fish\ning, hotels, ehatauquas \'and other at\ntractions with energetic men in charge\nwould certainly prove of inestima\nble benefit in the way of inducing\nthose who attend the exposition to\nmake a trip to the Mississippi coast.\nThe writer is in hearty sympathy with\nthis movement alunched by the busi\nness men of New Orleans and sees in\nit benefits almost equal for. Missis\nsippi as for Louisiana. It is impossi\nble at this time to fully recount even\na small part of these, but the time\nis ample and more will be said of the\nenterprise in the future.\n.__ J\nThe trucking season in the vicinity\nof Centerville has proven highly sat\nisfactory and the farmers are en\ncouraged to keep the industry up in\nthe future. Holly Haynes from one\nand one-third of an acre of pine land\nsold $180 worth of peas, cabbage and\nbunch beans. \'One acre of the land\nproduced cabbage earlier in the sea\nson that brought more than $100 net.\nHenry Terrell, a negro, has made an\naverage of $2 per day for every day\nof the year up to the present time.\nWhile only about 50 acres was plant\ned to truck, the income has been some?\nthing mope than. $16,000. ✓ .\nThe prairie alfalfa farms are sell\ning their crops at from $17.50 to $10\nper ton f. o. b. cars. This is a\nsplendid price and shows something\nof the value of alfalfa and the man\nner in which it is appreciated by those\nwho are compelled to purchase feed\nstuffs. _ ,\nSecretary Taft for a month’s va\ncation to be spent at Murray Bay,\nCanada. - - “ —;\nOld methods are being replaoed\nin Mississippi with new and„ every\nimprovement in cultivation and hand\nling more strongly convinces one that\nno state offers as much to a man for\nhis time and energy as ours. This\nstory may be getting a little old to\nsome who do not see it just as does\nthe writer, but there is always to him\nsomething good in the retelling. On\nly a few days since there appeared\nin the Laurel Ledger a story of what\nis being done in Jonea county, which\nis herewith reproduced as an example\nof what one man is actually doing:\n“In January J. M. Lindsey sold *a\ncrop of turnips off a plat of land at\nan average of about $100 per acre.\nThis was followed with lettuce which\nbrought an average yield of $150 per\nacre. When the lettuce was off Mr.\nLindsey had beans to follow. From\nthese he got about the same aver\nage as from the lettuce, say $150 to\nthe acre. He had corn in the mid\ndles which is now waist high. This\nwill be sold for roasting ears and\nfollowed by peas sown broadcast for\nhay. Turnips will follow which he\nthinks can be sold off by January.\nThis will make a new record for\nSouth Mississippi and as the fourth\ncrop is maturing it is perfectly rea\nsonable that this can be done. The\nthree crops sold have brought an ag\ngregate of about $450 to the acre and\nshould he get a like average from the\nother three crops it would mean more\nthan $800 tothe acre. Mr. Lind\nsey has about three acres in this plat\nthat promises to bring him more than\n$Z,dUU inis year. lutKse wuu aie i*uiu\npoor might profit by such experi\nence.” Experience similar to that\nof this Jones county gentleman can\nbe encountered every year in Mis\nsissippi. It is a great old state and\nthe future promises even greater\nthings still.\nThe writer is in receipt of an inter\nesting letter from Mr. J. D. Ashcraft,\nSr., of Amory, outlining some of the\ngood things in store\'for his section\nof Monroe county that is appreciated\nhighly. Among other things it is re\ncounted that the Illinois Central will\nlikely build a railroad through that\nsection, running from Aberdeen to a\npoint on the line from Corinth \\o\nJasper, Ala. Several thousand acres\nof timber land has recently been pur\nchased by interested parties and the\nprospect for the road is good. The\nfarmers of that section are of a high\nclass, energetic and work along right\nlines. Of course they are prosper\nous and happy. It is their purpose\nto put up nothing but the very best\nquality of canned goods and hope to\nestablish a trade that desires a first\nclass article and is willing to pay a\nfair price for it. A new school build\ning that will cost when completed\n$16,000 is in course of construction?\nPotatoes and other vegetables are be\ning extensively raised and many oth\ner good things are recounted. Mr.\nAshcraft writes a good letter and his\nexample is worthy of emulation by\nall who are interested in Mississippi\nand its future welfare.\nThe Gloster Chatauqua will be held\nat Sam Jones Camp Ground this\nmonth from July 21st to 29th, inclu\nsive. A high class program has been\nJ iVin V»oc>t ivlofifilpilt.\n--l\nto be had in the country and a pleas\nant and profitable outing is prom\nised those who attend. Hotels on the\ngrounds will take care of visitors and\nevery arrangement made looking to\ntheir comfort. The chatauqua spirit\nis growing in Mississippi, and deserv\nedly so. This class of institutions not\nonly afford a pleasant outing for our\npeople, but give valuable instruction\nas wTell. It is to be hoped that Glos\nter, Lake, Hattiesburg, Gulfport and\nother places with like entertainment\nwill experience a patronage this year\nthat will warrant the managers in\nmaking them larger and better next\nyear. The people demand something\nof the kind and the men behind these\nmovements are deserving of consider\nation and esteem at the hands of all.\nReports from over the state go to\nshow that farming conditions have\nimproved considerably since the last\nreport. Cotton has done well but is\ngenerally reported to be thirty days\nlate. Corn is not in so good condi\ntion, the old corn being very poor in\ndeed. The general impression is, that\nunder no conditions can the crop o/\nthis year equal that of last.\nAre you speaking well of your\nneighbors and the community iu\nwhich you live ¥ If not, you are not a\n“desirable citizen” in the language\nof President Roosevelt.

R. Runyan, the de\nfaulting teller of the Windsor Trust\nCompany, was arrested in New York\nand $94,410 of the money stolen from\nthe bank was recovered.\nRunyan was found in the apartment\nof Mrs. Lauro McCarter in West\n134th street, where he had been since\nlast Saturday.\nMrs. McCarter reported to the po\nlice that Runyan was in her flat. Sev\neral detectives at once surrounded\nthe house. As the detectives enter\ned Runyan was standing before a\nchiffoniere. He turned on the offi\ncers with a revolver in his hand, but\nwhen the officers rushed at him,\ndropped the weapon and surrendered\nto them saying:\n“The jig is up.”\nThe money was found in a suit\ncase, Mrs. McCarter said that she had\nno idea that Runyan was a default\ner when he came to her apartment\nlast Saturday; that he said that ke^\nwas ill, and requested permission to\nremain where he could obtain atten\ntion. She is his cousin.\nThe sum lost by the bank is said\nto Pe more man ?*oo,uuu. mwi uao u*-.\ncome of the balance lias not yet been\ndiscovered. Mrs. McCarter denies that\nshe had any of the money, and says\nshe did not betray him to the police\nbecause he did not divide with her,\nbut that she had just read the morn\ning papers and discovered that he\nwas a defaulter and that she felt\nthat she should not harbor a fugi\ntive from justice, and therefore noti\nfied the police.\nIt appears that Runyan gave Mrs.\nMcCarter a heavy gold bracelet a\nweek or two ago.\nMrs. McCarter was questioned as to\nher acquaintance with the prisoner.\nShe said that although his\'cousin, she\nfirst met him a year ago. The flat\nwas rented about that time, and Run\nyan paid for it, although he did not\nlive there.\nHe insists that he turned all the\nmoney he had left over to the author\nities and that there was not a dollar\nleft to him.\n“Oh,I’ve been speculating, you\nknow\'. All the wmrld knows that,”\nhe laughed.\nHe admitted that he bad contem\nplated suicide.\nAt the police station he accussed\nMrs. McCarter of having betrayed\nhim, and spoke very bitterly of her.\nWhen Runyan said he had given\nher $15,000 the woman declared the\nassertion false. Then, turning to the\ninspectors she said:\n“I’ll tell why I gave him up. I\nwas married, yet I went into the\nstreet and bought a paper and there\nI saw his picture. I took the picture\nback home and asked him if the pic\nture wras of him and he said it was.\n"Then he turned on like a tiger\nand said: “There’s money, but if\neither you or that damned nigger\n_ * .1 i * tin i.:n\nMary, squeai me ^\nyou. ’ ’\nAsked about the motive for the\nrobbery, Runyan said:\n111 needed the money. It was there\nand I took it. Some of it I lost in\nWall street and some of it I gave >o\nthis woman.”\nARKANSAS TOWN BURNED.\n• - •\n/\nBusiness Portion of Lake Village\nWiped Out.\nNatchez, Miss.—Information reach\ned this city to the effect that a dis\nastrous fire had swept the business\ndistrict of Lake Village, Ark.

Jus. Tv.\nVarda than failing to cotne up to\nexpectations of many of his sup\nporters.\nAs a sample of the impression\ncreated upon outsiders by the\nspeeches, the following expres\nsions ot Frederick Palmer, the\nwar correspondent, who was sent\nto Meridian by Collier\'s Weekly\nexpressly tor the purpose of sit\ning up the political situation in\nMississippi, will prove interest\nbig\nYou could uot bring together\na more thoroughly American au\ndience anywhere. A New York\ner was impressed with the fact\nthat everyone preseut was a born\nand not a naturalized citizen; all.\ncame from the old pioneer stock.\nThe good order, considering bow\nhigh tile feeding on both sides\nruns, was remarkable. I saw no\none drunk except a tew men with\nVardanian badges, who probably\nhad taken a few drinks too many\nthinking their lung power might\ngive out.\nI was disappointed in the Gov\nernor. The five hours’ speaking\nwas scarcely a debate. Ali the\ndebating was done by Mr. Wil\nliams. The Governor is a won-,\ndtrful actor, and a study in ges\nticulatory emotion; but he seems\nwnoijy uname 10 rant mom luauj\na miuute on any one line ot\nthought. Against such a ruas-,\nter of parliamentary logic as Mr.\nWilliams he did not make a good\nenough showing to give the de\nbate what you call the sporting\nquality. It was all over in the\nfirst round.\nAnyone who proposes to edu\ncate the $Tonth to the repeal of\nthe 15th amendment and starts\nout by comparing the President\nor tfie United States to a skunk,\nand says he is an unieeonstrueted\nConfederate who wishes bp was.,\nliving under the stars and bars,.!\ncan scarcely get a sympathetic,]\naudience. If anything would]\nprejudice a Northerner against]\nthe repeal of the 15th amend ]\nmeet it would be such wild and\nunnecessary appeal to passion\nand crudity ot manner as the\nGovernor exhibits. Mr. Wil\nliams’ rejoinder was one of finest\nexamples of parliamentary logic\nI have ever heard. It is he with\nhis breadth ot nmid and logic who\nmakes the North see the Situa\ntion as the South does and helps\ntowards the solution of the prob\nlem.\nOn flip opposite page of this\npaper will be found a iist ot ap\npointments to speak by the sev\neral candidates for State Senator\nand Representative, and by refer\ning to same you will observe that\nthe last place mentioned on the\nlist is /}ion. Whether the com\npiler ot thig list intended this as\nsarcasm or not, we know not;\nbut we are of the opinion that\nquite a Jarge percentage ot the\ncandidates will be apt to be think\ntng of a different place lrom Zion\na tew days after that speaking.\nThe strictures ot Governor\nVardanian upon the members of\nthe Meridian Board of Trade are,\nwe believe, utterly uncalled for;\nand we further believe the .very\nhonorable gentleman has been\nguilty of a “bull\'’ in saying any\'\n[thing at all. It frequently hap\nnens that the least said is the\neasiest mended, aud in this in\ni 6t.atauc(2 we believe it would have\nbeen good polities for the Gov\nernor not to have “shot off his\nmpgth” so loudly.\nThe Annual Fair of the Ncsho\'\nha County Stack aud Agricultur\nal Fair Association wall be held\nthis year at Fhiladelphia, July\nggiia to stitti inclusive. ju is in\ntended to make this the most at\ntractive of any in the Fair Asso\nciation’s history. Any informa\nt.ion desired can be secured from\nJ. LI. Huston, Secretary, Phila\ndelphia, Miss,\nAud npw the Hon. Earl Brew\ner comes forward with the charge\nthat the newspapers of the State\nhave been subsidised against\nhim by the railroads. The \'Hon\norable gentleman must have “hit\nthe , pipoV heavily when lie\ndreamed this dream.\n-:--- -\nA traveling man informed 11s\nyesterday that the talk “on the\nruarl” now was, that John Sharp\nWilliams would carry the state\nby 40*000 at least, and that\nCha.s ^coCtifvvas sure to befelect-,\ned ky yt -ie^st 30,QQO .majority.\nMr. Joni1‘\'„ Sharp "Williams is,\ngiving, his people some useful in-\'\nstrnetions in polities/ says the\nBaltimore (Mil.) Sun. In his\nspeeches be is telling them that,\nthe sopth has less that} one-thin/\not the members ot congress. To\nrepeal the Fifteenth Amendment\nwould require the vote of two\nthirds ot the members of each\nhouse, and then it would have to:\nbe ratified by three-fourths of the\nstates. As Mr. Williams justly\nsays, no one but a map with hjel\nhead in the clouds or in a dark\ncloset has the slightest notion !\nthjftt & resolution amending the\nConstitution by striking out this\narticle could receive the neoe3su-‘\nry vote in congress or ratification\nby three-fourths of the states.\nIt may pome dO or dO years lrom\':\nnow, but the present discussion\nof it is a waste ot time. It Mr.\nVardanian should go into the\nsenate, b.e .might .celebrate bis en\ntrance by introducing a joint\nresolution, in proper form, lor\nthe repeal ot the Fifteenth\nAmendment. It would be re\nferred to a committee, and that\ncommittee would throw it eon\nfemptuousjy in the wastebasket.\nAnd so the state ot Mississippi\nwould be represented in the sen\nate tor sia years by a man sentj\nuiera on an issue which wouiu\nbe disposed ot in less than six\nminutes. Th.e south should be\nrepresented in the senate by\nstatesmen grid not dy agitators\nand fadists.\nWe understand tpat Governor\nVardanian will speak iu this\ncounty on the 33 rd in&t. i\'iaee\nwill be named later.\nA short session ot Chancery\nCourt will be hell in DeKalb\nnext week—commencing Monr\nday.\nWhy Should John Sharp Williams\nbe Elected as U. S, Senator?\nBecause he is one of the na\ntion’s great men, and will one\nday rank with the great senators\not America. Governor Varda\nrnan has said so over his own\nsignature.\nThe question is being frequent\n!y asked now why the people\nshould elect John Sharp Wil\nliams as United States Senator.\nWe wish to introduce as a wit-1\nness to his superior qualifications\ntor the position the written testi\nmony ot Governor James Id\nVardaman, given at a time when\nthe cup ot his ambition had been;\nlilied to overflowing hy his elec\ntion as governor ot Mississippi,\nand before his judgement became\nclouded by the desire for his o\\vn\nelection.\n*-i i x * •\nVTl W l\nSept. 15th, 1903.\n■Mr. C. C. Elliott.\nMy Dear Sir: Your generous\nfavor ot the 9tb iust., received.\nI thank you tor the congratula\ntions and assure you that your\ngood wishes are most gratefully\nreceived.\nYour reference to John Sharp\'\nWilliams is deserved by him.\nlie is one ot the nation’s great\nmen and will one day rank with\nthe great senators of America.\nThanking you again tor your\nkind wishes, 1 am\nCordially and sincerely,\nJas K. Yard am an.\n—Jackson Hews.\n—— --♦ -- ■ —~\nStale Immigration,\nEither some of the candidates\nfor governor are very stupid or\nthey take the people of the state\nto be so, from the way7 in which\nthey persist in stating, in the\nface of the facts, that Mr. Scott,\nadvocates flooding the statu with\ndagpes. t\nSome , years ago Mr. Scott\nwrote an article for the Manufac\nturers’- Kecord of Bgltirn re, im\nwhich he advocated white immi\ngration to Mississippi, either\nsmall farmers, tenants or labor\ners. In this connection he wrote\nthat after spending soma months\nin Europe investigating farm la\nbor there, he was of the opinion\nthat thedUiiiian peasants of north\nern Italy were the be3t material\nfor our purposes. They were\naccustomed to a climate -some\nwhat like ours, were industrious\nand orderly and would make\ngood hands and good tenants.\nThis is the basjis of the “Dago\nBcare” that Truly, Bisson and\nBrewer try to use to stampede\nthe voters away tram Mr. Scott.\nIn his platform, Mr. Scott has\nnothing to say on this question,\nnot because die does not believe\nin,it as an industrial1 proposition,\nbut because be knows it is not a\npolitical question, and least of\nall a political issue, lie wants,\naqd we all want, to see q Jargon\nproportion ^k,v.\'hUu)ln.*ou income\nstate, ■ pap vjdb\'-l..they are of lithe)\n.proper a0rf.T4^yc.ty-:i?^gqap, \\\n\' i\nEnoqdgJe Events.\nThe farmers are having fine\nweather ndw and work is pro\ngressing rapidly.\n.$.

Piedmont-Bedford Concentrated\nI Iron k Alum Water • . I\nI Is\' Nature’s Remedy for Nature’s Ills. Yes, when you consider that disease comes\nfrom impoverished or run down conditions of the system, this Natural Mineral Water\nfurnishes the system what it needs.\nThe analysis of this Water, shown on the bottle, tells you what Nature minlTs\nyou should fake when sick, and the doctor who reads it-will agree.\nDo you think the grouping together in this Water of 17 different minerals, which\nare recognized by medical writers ns most powerful blood tossics, could have lv;en m\naccidental ? Reason answers, NO 1\nAn 18-oz bottle of Piedmont-Kedford Concentrated Iron and Alum water contains\nal! the minerals of 25 gallons of the average natural water—Then why buy a barrel ||\nof water when you can get a bottle of minerals at the trivial cost of\none dallar. The dose is a teaspoonful in a glass of your own spring water.\nHow this Water acts upon the system is not clearly known. It is judged mainly\nby its works.

Ruck,\'\nI of hits own will, iir consequence of\nhis advanced age, thus rendering\nhim unable from feebleness to per\nform the pastoral duties, as messen\nger of Christ to this flock of believ\ners, J rusting that a more active shep\nherd would better advance God’s di\nvine work in.this vineyard.\nWiirrkas: God in His wonderful\nworks created all tilings—man in\nHis own image, breathing into him\nan immortal soul, and by reason of\nstrength, lie may live to he three\nscore years and ten, even four Score\nor more. With many, life has been\nshortened, filled with sorrows and\ntribulations; with others prolonged,\nfull of usefulness for the Master and\nexemplary work for the good and\nbenefit of mankind. Today our\nhearts are made to feel regretfully\nserious; by the tendering of the re\nsignation of our faithfully beloyed\npastor Rev. .). H. Buck, who has so\nzealously, so earnestly, so dutifully\nand so acceptably served us, the\nScooba Baptist congregation, in sor\nrow and sunshine, in weakness and\nstrength, in adversity and prosperi\nty, in fear and love, always with a\nmessage from Him who gave His\nlife that we might be redeemed and\nsaved. For these many years he\nhas been our watchful shepherd,\never ready to lead us in green pas\ntures, beside the still waters, to an\nimmortal home, where our souls\nwill be beautified and blessed\nthroughout eternal ages. While loth\nto accept, duty prompts us to Afield\nto the request, as ii"t with him lias\nalmost ripened into the harvest, and\nfeebleness dethroned strength. Our\nlove and esteem for him will grow\nnone the less\' out- pravers stronger\nand more fervent for continued life\nand a safely guarded passage, when\nthe numbered days are no more, to\nthe shores of swept deliverance,\nwhere the Divine Master will crown\nh i m i n starry robes of immortal\nglory and welcome his soul in heav\nen’s home—“Well done, thou good\nand faithful servant; enter thou into\nthe joys of thv Lord.”\nBe it therefore Kesolved, by Scoo\nba Baptist Church : That we deeply\nregret, from our long association as\npastor and congregation, to accept\nthe resignation of our beloved and\nalways faithful pastor, Key. J. II.\nBuck, who has served us for tiie\npast--— years without price, as\nChrist served the people when on\nearth. His time and means have\nbeen given to aid in our weakness,\nnumerically and financially. Thro’\nhis efforts and prayers, the house in\nwhich the congregation worship was\nerected and will ever be held in\ngrateful remembrance of his faith\nful and generous labors. May Cod\ndirect tjus^cougregation in selecting\nhis successor, and may they hold\nhis hands up as their shepherd and\npray that he may be as faithful and\nlead them as long as his predecessoi\nwol! rlmui\nBe it further Resolved: That a\ncopy of this preamble and resolu\ntion.. be entered upon tiie minutes\nof the church, and a copy he fur\nnished to Bro.

He certainly was\nsplendidly constructed; about six feet\ntall, very fair-complexioned, and with\nal as handsome as a picture, with an\neasy boyish move*hnd a merry twinkle\nin his eye which it was hard for\nJohnny to hide even when he tried\nto look severe, for he was military,\nwas Johnny. All West Pointers are,\nwhen they first join their regiment,\nLieut. Biddle (our Johnny) being no\nexception to the rule, and when he\njoined our troop K, Seventh United\nStates cavalry, at Fort Lincoln, D. T.,\nin September, 1876, the above sobri\nquet was handed out to him and it\nstuck. He would do the funniest\nthings, so we thought, but it was all\nstrictly military; he didn’t seem to\nrealize at first that he had struck a\nregiment of real troopers and that we\nwere there to protect the frontier, not\nlook pretty. These nice little military\npoints when Lieut. Biddle was on duty\nwent against the grain, but he was a\nman, every inch of his six feet, and\nsquare; no favorites, only just a lit\ntle too military at first. But that wore\noff in time.\nAfter a hard campaign the follow\ning summer of ’77 the seventh, about\nthe first of September, struck the\nTongue river cantonment on the Yel\nlowstone,. and had only one little\nbrush with the Indians, about 000\nsoldiers to 84 Indians. They tried to\nescape, but we captured them all ex\ncept four and they went to the happy\nhunting grounds. Now Johnny was\nall fire, didn’t say much, but wanted\nto fight. After we corralled the Chey\nennes we turned them over to Gen.\nMiles at Cedar Creek on the Yellow\nstone. This was in June, and John\nny certainly looked disappointed when\nhe didn’t even get a go at the In\ndians. Our troop that day was rear\nguard. A few days later we struck\na herd of buffalo, probably 3000, scat\ntered over about ten miles or more of\nterritory. Two men were detailed out\nof each of five companies to make a\nkilling. All the officers knew Lient.\nBiddle’s desire for adventure and he\nwas put in charge of the ten men. He\nrode a crackerjack of a horse; his\neyes shone like diamonds, and before\nwe struck the first few old bulls he\ncalled me to him and said, “Stine,\nyou’ve been raised in this country,\nhaven’t you?”\n“Yes, sir, I said.”\n“Know all about killing buffaloes?”\n“Some little,” I replied.\n“Now, I don’t want to go wrong\non this hunt,” said the lieutenant,\n“tnd I don’t want any mishap, nor do\nI want the command to have the laugh\non me. Now, I’m ordered not to kill\nover 25, but there you see they are\nstampeding already.”\n“Just what you want,” I said. “Hold\nyour bridle with the left hand and\ncarbine in the right; dash into the\nherd and keep going with ’em; don’t\nstop; pay no attention to your right\nhand side, they will keep away from\nyou. Now pick the cow—always pick\na young cow, they can run faster and\nit takes a good horse to outrun them.\nRide up on the right hand side, lean\nover a little toward the buffalo, throw\nyour carbine in the hollow of your\nleft arm and blaze away. But, Lieu\ntenant, don’t shoot too quick; wait un\ntil your saddle is just opposite the\nbrute’s hump, for the minute you hit\none li it uuu t gu si «,«! i*\nquicker’n greased lightning and catch\nyour horse in the flank as he goes by.\nNow don’t stop, whatever you do; just\nkeep going with the herd and when\nyou think you have killed enough,\npull out to one side, if you \'get an\nopening, understand—”\n“Yes, I guess so,” said Biddle. “Now\nlet’s at them.”\nWell, the Lieutenant watched me\nshoot my first cow buffalo and, sure\nenough, she didn’t go down. As I said,\nshe turned the second she was hit, but\nmy horse had passed her and on we\nwent. Biddle was riding on my right\nabout ten yards away, and looking at\nme, smiled and nodded, then dashed\nahead on his own account. His horse\ncertainly was a hummer. Besides be\ning scared he could go some, and in\na few minutes he was somewhere in\nthe herd, I suppore; away ahead of me.\nthe herd, I suppose; away behind of m\nridden about four miles with them, my\nhorse being almost out.\nSo I thought I’d try to catch a young\nbuffalo just ahead of me, and if I got\nhim I’d quit. It had been a hard run\nand the buffalo, as well as my horse,\nwas preety well blown, but I was\ngaining on him very fast lie was only\nten yards ahead and I was ready to\ndrop him. I didn’t have time to look\nabout me, but. “bang” went a six\nshooter just ahead \'of me.\n1 k\nAt the same moment I saw; a none\ndrop just as dead as a mackerel. Hl8\nrider hadn’t had time to dismount. I\npulled up and, would you believe It,\nthere was Lieut. Biddle trying to get\nhis leg from under his dead horse. The\nunfortunate chump had shot at my\nbuffalo as It passed, but Instead of hav\ning his horse face the way the buffalo\nwas going Biddle used his six-shooter\nand shot directly over his horse’s head.\nHis horse must have thrown up his\nhead, for he had actually shot the poll\nof his horse’s head off. Dead? .Well\nthat horse was sure a dead one.\nThe lieutenant looked at me with a\nsort of a silly, sickly smile, and said:\n“Well, I’m blamed—”\n“How’d you do it?” I asked.\n“Didn’t you see?” That was all he\nsaid, but he stood looking sadly at his\nread horse, occasionally looking back\ntowards the trail over which we had\ncome. He then said: “Stine, how far\nis it back to the command?”\n“Oh, not far,” I replied, "not over\nfive miles.”\nThen he looked at his horse again.\nOne could see he was ashamed. I\nwanted to laugh; but on second\nthought I thought discretion was bet\nter, as he was “military.”\' Finally be\ntween us we managed to get the saddle\nand carbine off his dead horse. I offer\ned him the use of my horse, but he\nwouldn’t have it that way. So, put\nting his accoutrements on my saddle,\nwe started back afoot, I leading my\nhorse.\nWe hadn’t gone fifty yards when\npoor Johnny turned white as a sheet\nand collapsed; but he wasn’t altogether\nout. I grabbed my canteen and handed\nit to him. After taking a few swallows\nof water his color came back; he sat\nthere a few minutes and said: “Sprain\ned ankle: mill mv boot off!”\nSure enough his ankle had swollen\nso that I couldn’t-pull his boot off, so\nhad to cut it off.\n“Take my horse, lieutenant, and\nleave the saddle here. I’ll come back\nafter it, for I can\'t carry it.”\n“I guess I’ll have to,” said Johnny.\nSo we started back to the command.\nPoor Johnny! His sprained ankle\ncost him dear; for a very short while\nafter the buffalo hunt we met the\ngreat Nez Perces Indian Chief Joseph\nin battle at the Bear Paw Mountains,\nMontana. Lieut. Biddle was so lame\nthat he could not take proper care of\nhimself. He was shot all to pieces, as\nwas his captain, Owen Hale, and\ntwenty-four men out of a total of thir\nty-eight composing Troop K, Seventh\nCavalry—Sing Sing Star of Hope. %\nLAND OF BLOODSHED.\nFearful Annual Record of Murders\nand Woundings in Italy.\nThe latest criminal statistics of\nItaly reveal the fact that during the\nyear 1903, 310G persons were mur\ndered and 93.7G8 wounded. The fig\nures show a decrease from the preced\ning year in the number of killed,\nwhich is attributed to the progress of\nsurgery, but there is an increase in\nthe number of wounded.\nIt is calculated that in a period of\ntwenty-seven years 97,000 (persons\nmet violent deaths and 2,000,000 have\nbeen wounded. The statistics relate\nexclusively to crimes referred to the\ncourts, and do not include wounds\nwhich healed within ten days or cas\nes which were hidden from the po\nlice.\nCrimes cf blood show a decreasing\ntendency as compared with the in\ncrease in population. The record for\ncriminality is held by Sicily, where\nflip nrmmrtinn nf mnrrliprs reaches 42\nto every 100,000 inhabitants in the\nprovince of Girgenti. The proportion\ndecreases in other provinces and falls\nto 25 for every 100,000 in Naples. It\nstill further decreases considerably in\nnorthern Italy, where, at Bergamo,\nthere is only one murder for every\n100,000 persons.\nPulse Tells Age and Sex.\nHow old are you? Ask your pulse.\nThe human pulse has a wide range,\neven in perfectly healthy persons.\nThe female pulse always beats faster\nthan the male, and from birth to death\nthe pulse beats steadily decrease. It\nhas been said by great authorities that\nthe age and sex of a person could be\nascertained by the rate of the pulse\nalone. Babies at birth have a pulse\nbeat of 160 times a minute in case of\na girl and 150 in the case of boys. At\nthe age of four or five the pulse beats\nwill have fallen respectively to 110\nand 100. Maidens’ and youths\' pulses\naverage 95 and 90. Mature men and\nwomen have an average of 60 and 50.\nAn old woman’s pulse rarely, if ever,\nsinks below 50, but among old men a\npulse beat below 50 is quite common.\nThere are, however, great variations\nconsistent with health.

And It\nmight truthfully be called the most\npopular, for such it seems to be in\nmany senses. Certainly it is the\nform of art most now talked about,\nand If the results achieved to date\nhave not been in direct proportion\nto the discussion it has caused, that\nhas been more due to the brief period\nunder which it has been discussed\nand the many practical difficulties\nthat attend realization than for any\nother reasons.\nThe agencies which are now In\nterested in civic betterment are very\nnumerous. Many of them have no\nart interest whatever, but are con\ncerned with practical matters of\nhealth and sanitation which are ob\nviously of greater Importance than\nany questions of beauty or pure em\nbellishment. Transportation inter\nests are also vitally interested in\ncivic betterment, interested not only\nfor the improvement of existing facil\nities, but Interested also in the future\ngrowth of the localities^ they are\nserving, whose own future will de\npend so largely upon them.\nThe artistic aspect of civic better\nment is, as a matter of course, its\nleast important side, the side least\nneeded, which ministers least to the\ncitizens’ necessities, and which, never\nhaving been very prominent in con\ntemporary life, seems the one aspect\nthat can be most easily spared. Yet\nthis is the aspect that has been most\nprominently brought forward and has\nbeen most insisted upon. On the\nwhole this has been a very fortunate\ntj. ; _ a 1 ♦ Vi\ndieuJLuav,cmv>c. x«. --»\nvisible aspect of civic betterment that\nhas won its greater number of sup\nporters. People who could not see\nthe value of a certain kind of sewage\ndisposal—which they would never\nsee—could immediately recognize the\nmerits of a public work of art—\nwhich they could see—stood up for\nthe edification of all beholders.\nThere has been no loss in the insist\nence of the art point of view in the\nbetterment campaigns. It has added\na host of interested supporters to the\nmovement, and given it a distinction\nit might otherwise never have had.\nHistorically the artistic elements\nstand easily first, for the whole agi\ntation began in urging the claims of\na better outward appearance and in\nsetting forth the merits of certain\nworks of art which were desired for\ncertain localities. It was very early\nseen that the setting up of a single\nmonument, the purchase of a paint\ning, the plea for more beautiful\nflower gardens, and other like sug\ngestions were not sufficient. Public\nbetterment, if was found, must be\ngeneral betterment. Those interest\ned in public health urged the greater\nimportance of their own specialty\nwhich they justly thought should be\ndeveloped before any funds, public\nor private, were expended on orna\nmental and artistic matters.\nThe movement for civic betterment\nhas, therefore, taken on a very much\nbroader view than at first seemed\npossible. It is now concerned, prac\ntically, with every public aspect of\ncivic life. And what is very much\nmore valuable, most of the vital\nforces which are related to this work\nare now more or less closely joined\nin it. The beginnings of a great\nwork have been well started in an\neffective way. v/T"\nv .\ny Why the Show Failed.\nDo you know why that show at the\njpera house did not have any crowd\nt<5 speak of?
