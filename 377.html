        <pre>['THE EUREKA SENTINEL\nESTABLISHED 1870 EUREKA, NEVADA. FEBRUARY 14,1920 PUBLISHED SATURDAYS\n* * f - -- ~ . . • v\' • ’\nMMOESUS NEWS\nHe* Machinery Arrives and Is Be\n■gg Installed—Mine Develop\nments Continue to Dis\nclose New Ore Bodies\nTwo new compressors arrived In\nEureka this week for the company,\nand have been hauled to the mine,\nwhere the foundations are ready to\nre(CiTe them. Within ten days air\nconnections will be made, and a large\nnumber of drills will be added to\nthose now In use for the constantly\nexpanding operation* underground,\npermitting an early exploration of\nmany valuable discoveries In ore de\nposits. This much desired work has\nbeen retarded by the more necessary\ncouple*100 of the main development\nplans and connections with old open\nings in the mine*.\nA late model double drum hoist Is\nnow on its way to Eureka, and when\nthis arrives it will be erected where\nthe large gasoline hoist has been ac\ncomplishing good work, and the lat\nter removed to a new location, where\nit is needed for the more rapid ac\ncomplishment of certain plans in the\ngeneral course of development.\nThe removal of old fills in the\nMope and drifts of the Dundprberg\nworkings has exposed another level\nfall of waste, that Is being excavated\nto determine its importance and exact\nlocation.\nRegarding the reported strike on\nthe 400-foot level, Julius lluebner,\nthe Superintendent, said to-day:\n"Work on this level is continually\nenlarging an already extensive area\nof ore bearing limestone that cannot\nfail to please every one connected\nwith the company, but also those who\nhave Interest* la other portions of the\ndistrict. Ift the past week we have\nfound two ftew masses of the same\nquality of high grade ore that we\nhave recently been shipping—the\nkind that runs into hundreds of dol\nlars per toft- The numerous places\nwhere this rich material Is found, the\nlarge size of the ore bodies, and its\npersistency in both lateral and verti\ncal development* of the property Is\nconvincing evidence that the returns\nfrom high grade material alone are\ngoing to be an extremely Important\nlactor In the profits of the company.\nWe expected In the beginning, and\nfound when our workings were far\nenough completed to reach the depth\noriginally contemplated, great quan\ntities of medium grade ore, but the\namount of ore encountered contain\ning sensational values, has exceeded\nall of our expectations at this stageof\nprogress."\n(DORK BARRED\nFROM INCOME WES\nRevenue Collector Warns Citizens\nAgainst Hit-or-Miss Tactics\nSan FrancUco. Feb. 9.—A word\nof warning to Income taxpayers is\ncontained in a statement given out to\nil)\' l>y internal Revenue Collector\n■Justice S. Wardell, who points out\n•bat returns must show all Items of\ntaxable income for 1919.\nGuesswork estimates, and other\nhit-or-miss tactics are barred when\na person lg making out his income tax\nreturn. Accuracy and completeness\nmust be Insisted upon. And remem\nber, the return is a sworn statement;\nas such, it must be thorough und ac\ncurate.\nSalaried persons and wage-earners\nmust not confine their return to\nfigures showing a year\'s pay at so\nmuch a day or so much a week. The\nactual amount drawn should beascer\ntatned and reported. Overtime,\nbonuses, shares in the profits of a\nbusiness, value of quarters and board\nfurnished by the employer, and a\nnumber of other items of similar na\nture which are compensations for\nservices, are taxable as a part of the\nyear\'s earnings, and must he includ\ned. March 15 Is the time limit for\nfiling returns.\nThere are no privileged characters,\n00 distinctions, in the personal in\ncome tax. Everybody living in the\nUnited States, whether citizens or\nslien is subject to this law. In order\n10 be practical—to keep the wheels\nfrom becoming clogged with useless\nrecords—the law does not require\n*hnual returns of the very small in\ncomes. The beginning is at $1000\ntor an unmarried person and $2000\ntor a married couple.\nREBUILDING OF RUBY HILL\nRAILWAY SPUR BEGAN FRIDAY\n!\'• T. Herr timer, Huperlntendent of\nthe Development Company, Ar\nrived in Kureka Monday\nL. T. Herchmer, the newly appoint\ned superintendent of the Ruby Hill\n| Development Company, arrived In Eu\nreka on Monday\'s train from the\nEast. Mr. Herchmer was accompan\nied by his wife, and they are occupy\ning the superintendent\'s residence on\nRuby Hill. H. P. Henderson of New\nYork, consulting engineer of the com\npany, was also In the party.\nMr. Herchmer stated that work\n; will proceed at once to prepare the\ni surface plant and mine workings for\nj steady operation and development. A\nI number of men are now employed at\nthe mine and more will be added as\nfast as they can be accommodated.\nTho rails and ties will be delivered\nin Eureka this week, and as there is\nonly 8000 feet of track to be replaced\nbetween the mines and Eureka, this\nimportant part of the rehabilitation\nplans will soon beaccomplished. With\nthe spur to the mines completed, coal\nand other supplies can be quickly de\nlivered to the mine yards, and It will\nthen be but a few days until work is\nresumed in Its old time manner.\nIt was a great source of satisfac\ntion to the citizens of Eureka to see\nyesterday the commencement of work\non the lluby Hill spur. A crew of\nmen on a string of flat cars began the\nre-ballasting of the grade from the\ndepot to the mines, and in a few days\nthe roadbed will be ready for traffic\nto the present end of the spur.\nGEORGE LAIRD MARRIED\n\\\\>(l<le<l to Mis* Myrtle Phillips of\nIsm Angeles at Sacramento, Cal.\nWord has been received in Eureka\nthis week of the marriage of George\nW.

The young\ncouple will make their home in Sac\nramento, where the groom Is em\nployed by a Sacramento express com\npany.\nThe groom, the eldest son of Mr.\nand Mrs. R. A. Laird and a native\nBon of Eureka, has a host of friends\nhere who will extend their congratu\nlations and best wishes to him and\nhis bride for a prosperous and happy\nmarried life. He is said to have\nclaimed the hand of an estimable\nyoung lady of refinement and edu\ncation who has been making Los An\ngeles her home, where she has been\nemployed as a stenographer.\nRECENT SECRET CANYON\nSTRIKE SHOWS IMPROVEMENT\nDan G. Kelly, who made the re\ncent strike in the Secret Canyon sec\ntion of the Eureka district, was in\ntown yesterday and reports a fine\nshowing of mineral.\nKelly says he is now down about 7\nfeet on the ore body, which occurs\nnear a shale and limestone contact,\nwith some porphyry associated with\nthe material in the fissure, and that\nthe average values in five assays this\nweek were 3 2 ounces of silver, 6 per\ncent lead, and $2 gold. He is work\ning about 1500 feet south of the old\nMonroe mine, a well known producer\nof early days, and the Indications are\nthat the same zone of fracturing ex\ntends into the Kelly claims.\nHIGH SCHOOL NOTES\nThursday, Lincoln’s birthday, was\ncelebrated by the following program\nas a fitting memorial to this great\nAmerican:\nSong — “America”.School\nPoem—“Captain, My Captain”.\n.Dorothy Goss\nLincoln\'s Gettysburg Address.\n.Pauline HJul\nLincoln\'s Letter of Condolence to\nMrs. Bigsby.Grace Cazier\nSong—"Star Spangled Banner"\n.

Lfncoln\'s birth\nday falling on the 12th, Valentine’s\nDay on the 14th, and Washington’s\nbirthday on the 22nd, gives the short\nest month an unusual amount of hol\nidays, or days to be observed.\nAs time passes it is becoming more\nand more a custom of our people to\npay tributes of respect on the anni\nversary of the birthdays of Washing\nton, the founder of our country, and\nto our martyred President. Lincoln, j\nThe young America of to-day is being\ninstilled with the principles of these\ngreat men whose history and wonder- ]\nful achievements in making this a\nfree and independent Nation is known\nto all.\nValentine’s Day is sacred to the\nmemory of St. Valentine and of very\nancient origin. The custom of ex\npressions of sentiment and adoration\non valentines dates back to remote\nperiods. A worn valentine yellow\nwith time often brings to the memory\nof the recipient in old age the epi\nsodes and dreams, as it were of\ntheir youth. Old traditions say that\nthis is mating time, and like the\nseason of Spring, when hearts turn\nlightly to thoughts of love, St. Valen\ntine\'s Day Is looked upon as the day\nfor Cupid to pierce with his arrow\nthe heart of the one adored.\nVALENTINE VERSES\nBY MARY HUMPHREY\nTO A GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND\nDear Girl of My Dreams, I am com\ning.\nBack from war I am coming to\nyou;\nAnd 1 wonder what fate will be wait\ning for me,\nAnd will you be glad I came\nthrough?\nIt’s so strange. They have called me\na brave man.\nAnd they gave me a medal or two;\nIn the fight I feared nothing—and\nyet I\'m afraid\nOf a small brown-eyed person like\nyou!\nDo you know that I love you? I won\nder.\nOh. what ages and ages it seems\nSince I left you! Perhaps it\'s absurd,\nbut I hope\nThat I\'ve been the Man of Your\nDreams.\nTO HIS FAIRY\nIf I Just dared to say it.\nYou sure can bet I would\nRight up and tell you what I feel—\nGee, but I wish 1 could!\nOh. kiddo, you\'re so classy,\nWith those big eyes of blue.\nYou\'ve got the others beat a mile—\nThere sure ain’t none like you.\nNo chance for me—I know it.\nI’m such a roughneck guy—\nBut if I thought you\'d look at me.\nOh, Boy! I’d make the try.\nBelieve me, you’re some fairy,\nYou\'re"better’n I deserve;\nI’d send a Valentine—but gee,\nI just ain’t got the nerve!\nA SUBSTITUTE\nA Valentine I\'ve tried to find\nThat’s nice enough for you;\nBut there is none-so here’s my heart;\nI hope that it will do.\nTO HIS MOTHER\nToday an old sweetheart of mine\nIs my most precious Valentine;\nMy best and oldest sweetheart you\nAre, mother dear. So loyal, true\nAnd tender always. And your love\nI cherish over and above\nEarth’s fairest gifts. You’ve made of\nme\nAll that I am and hope to be.\nMother mine,\nMy Valentine.\nWashington\'s Birthday Dance\nThe next social event announced\nto take place in Eureka is the Rebek\nah dance celebrating Washington’s\nbirthday, to be held in their hall on\nFriday evening, February 20. Good\nmusic will be provided, and every\nbody is invited to attend and have a\ngood time.\nIf you follow the beaten path you’ll\navoid brambles, but you won’t gather\nany roses.\nNobody actually wishes to know the\ntruth about himself.\nOnce there was a beautiful girl who\ndidn\'t know It. She was insane.\nNEW GOLD STRIKE\nMADE IN THE CEDARS\nRich Float Found on Roth Bides of\nKureka Canyon Starts Xew Min\nin* Excitement\nBriefly speaking, what is called the\nC«wlars is a wide fan-shaped anticline\nemanating from the north end of\nProspect Mountain and radiating\nfrom the famous\ngradually wldenir\nto the northwest ning a\nlabyrinth of smi nd ra\nvines, cedar grovi glades,\nall looking alike to tn. .erage per\nson. Old residents of Eureka recall\nthe fact that many prospectors in the\nyarly days brought in rich specimens |\nSore of a different character than\nat produced by the mines of Ruby\nand Adams Hill. After imbibing a\nlittle and celebrating as the average\nprospector did in those days, they\nwould try to return to the spot, but\ncould not find the place. This led to\nthe conclusion that th$y were work\ning the bartender for the drinks and\nit became a Joke-small wonder. They\ncould not return to the present pros\npect as the country looked the Same\nand was coveted with a wash of ce\nmented limestopeand\'qu\'aTtzit\'e bould\ners.\nIn an interview with Clarence\nJohnson he modestly stated “the boys\n,\'ound it some time ago, meaning my\nsons O. C. and Ted Johnson, brought\nin some of the rich float, and on mak\nng an assay began a systematic search\nwith the result that five cross frac\ntures were located, all highly miner\nalized and producing a different char\nacter of ore; mostly a hard carbon\nate with chloride of silver and a\nhigher value in gold than is usually\nfound in this camp. Samples assay\nfrom 70 to 100 ounces silver, $40 to\n$80 in gold, and 5 to 30 per cent\nlead. The same character of ora was\ndiscovered by Charles Minoletti and\nothers on the east side of the railway.\nImmediately a rush was on and the\ncountry is now located for miles.”\nMr. Johnson further states that he\nis negotiating for a drill and system\natic prospecting will begin at once,\nand he lookB for mines to be opened\nup that will eclipse anything ever\nfound in the Eureka district, and\nventures to say, in the State of Ne\nvada.\nDEATH HOVERING NEAR\nAccording to the Carson Appeal,\nno hope is held out by physicians for\nthe recovery of Miss Emma Vander\nleith. mention of whose serious ill\nness at San Francisco was made in a\nrecent issue of the “Sentinel.” Miss\nVanderleith and her family were\nformer residents of Eureka, and old\nfriends here will be sorry to learn\nthat her days are numbered.\nThe Appeal states that Miss Van\nderleith has not been well since an\nattack of the flu last Winter, and\nthis condition was aggravated by a\nsevere cold she caught while at the\nCoast this Summer. Like many oth\ners she overtaxed her strength with\nwar work and was not in a physical\ncondition to throw off the effects of\nthe flu and throat trouble.\nIn December she had a nervous\nbreakdown which affected her heart\nand her Keno physician advised a\nchange of climate and lower altitude\nfor a while. Taking Miss Ella Rookh\nwith her she went to San Francisco\nand at first gained in health. She\nwas about to return home a month\nago when she had a bad turn and the\ndoctors advised her going to a hos\npital. She did so and was again Im\nproving and had made plans to re\nturn to her home in Reno sometime\nlast week, when a change for the\nworse again occurred and her broth\ner was summoned to her bedside. He\nwill remain with her to the end.\nTHE MOVING PICTURES\nAt the Eureka Theatre Sunday\nevening, February 15, “Mrs. Leffing\nwell\'s Boots”—Constance Talmadge\nis the star in this side-splitting com\nedy with every day situations.

We merely present\nthe facts as stated by Dr. Krebs, with\nthe idea of giving the matter public\nity and encouraging others to give it\na trial.\nDuring the Fall of 1918 when the\ninfluenza epidemic visited this section\nof Nevada, the Washoe Indian used a\nroot In the treatment of their sick\nwhich was gathered along the foot\nhills of this slope of the Sierra. The\nplant proved to be a rare species of\nthe parsley family (Leptotemla dis\nsects), according to a report from the\nUniversity of California.\nThe Indians gather this root in the\nlate Fall, November being considered\nthe proper month for gathering. The\nroot is used In the fresh or dry state.\nIt is cut up and a decoction is made\nby boiling the root in water, skim\nming off the top and giving large\ndoses of the broth. A pound of root\nis considered about the proper dose\nto treat a case of fever for three days,\nwhich is the longest time needed to\nbreak up a fever due to influenza or\na pulmonary disease, although the\nWashoes use it as a panacea. Wheth\ner a coincidence or not, there was not\na single death in the Washoe tribe\nfrom influenza or its complications,\nalthough Indians living in other\nparts of the State where the root did\nnot grow died in numbers. \' It was\nsuch a remarkable coincidence that\nthe root was investigated by a prac\nticing physician who saw apparently\nhopeless cases recover without any\nmedication or care of any kind. A\npreparation was prepared and em\nployed in a great many cases among\nthe whites, from the mildest to the\nmost virulent types of influenza, and\nit proved among other things, that it\nis the nearest approach we have to\nday to a specific in epidemic Influenza\nand the accompanying pneumonia.\nWhere used early it proved itself to\nbe a reliable agent in preventing pul\nmonary complications. Other physi\ncians were induced to give it a trial,\nwith the same results. It is beyond\nthe experimental stage, as its thea\npeutic action in this direction is es\ntablished and beyond doubt. The\ncases in which it has been used run\ninto the hundreds. There is probably\nno therapeutic agent so valuable in\nthe treatment of influenza pneumo\nnia, and as far as being tried, in or\ndinary lobar pneumonia if started\nearly. It action on coughs is more\ncertain than the opiate expectorants\nand its benefit is lasting. It acts as\na powerful tonic to the respiratory\nmucous membranes. It is a bron\nchial, Intestinal and urinary anti\nseptic and is excreted by these organs\nIt seems to stimulate thepneogastrics\nand causes a slow pulse with increased\nvolume and reduced tension. It is a\npronounced diaphoretic and some\nwhat diuretic, and it is a stimulating\nand sedative expectorant. In large\ndoses it is a laxative, and in extreme\ndoses emetic.\nTo make a therapeutically active\npreparation, the proper variety of the\nroot must be selected in the late Fall\nand properly cured out of the sun. Its\nactive principals must be extracted\nwith as little as possible of the ob\njectionable constituents. The active\nprincipals of the root are decidedly\ncomplex.

His appointment\n„ chief of the general staff of the\nfrench army took effect January 28.\nSeveral times in his book General\nBuat pays high tribute to the fighting\nqualities and marvelous efficiency of\nthe Amerlcen army, eapeclally during\nprt of the campaign of 1918.\nThe most striking part of the vol\nume. however, la where this French\nmajor general with supreme author\nity attached to hia name and func\nUon.demonstratea that if the armis\ntice bad not been concluded on No\nvember 11. 1918, four daya later the\nGerman army would have gone down\nto the greatest military defeat In the\nsssafs of the world.\nGeneral Buat writes:\n"We must destroy the legend of a\nmilitary unvanquished Germany and\nvemust loudly proclaim that It la not\nto a revolution that we owe our vic\ntory. When the armistice was signed\nUe German army was not the for\nmidable one of July 15, 1918. Then\nIt numbered eighty divisions, which\nkad been diminished under the Allies\'\nBows to such an extent that It was\npctlcally reduced to about fifteen\nmerve divisions, only two of which\ncould have been thrown immediately\nixto battle. At the same hour, the\nAllies bad more than 100 divlaions.\n"The Franco-American attack with\nthirty divisions which could have been\nfollowed up by one of equal strength,\nvus to be ready November 14th to\nMart from east of Meti and march to\nthe Sarre and the Rhine. Nothing\ncould have stopped it. The German\nstaff knew this so well that it had or\ndered the evacuation of Metz and\nThionville.\n"More than 160 German divlaions,\nscattered and exhausted, would have\nhid to retreat between Dutch Lim\nburg and the Mosselle river, pursued\nby the Americans and French. The\nFranco-American forces would have\ncounted their trophies by hundreds\nof thousands of men and by thous\nands of guns. History has never wit\nnessed such a catastrophe as was\nplanned."\nThat is the truth and it is well the\ntruth should be known. If the war\nbad lasted only three weeks more the\nGerman army would have undergone\na defeat without precedent and the\nAmerican army would have won an\nunprecedented victory. It means that\nIf any people have a right to cry over\nthe armistice it is the Allies and not\nthe Germans.\nNevada State News\nThe County Commissioners of Wa\nihoe County voted to refuse to pay\nhe State license fees on trucks and\nnotor cars owned by the county.

Nixon\nof Nevada, will fight the marriage\nof his mother to Harold Adrian,\nmovie organist and self-styled Span\nish count, says the Examiner.\nBelieving his mother is the victim\nof undue influence on the part of\nAdrian and some of those most close\nly connected with him, Nixon was\nplanning Wednesday to take steps to\nprotect his parent against what he\ndeems a sinister conspiracy to gain\npossession of the large fortune which\nthe Senator left her.\nMrs. Nixon is the victim of a\nstrange hypnotic spell, in the opin\nion of her son, who spoke strongly in\nrepudiation of the claim to nobility\nof his new stepfather. Nixon is a\ndozen years the senior of his mother\'s\nhusband.\nProving his mother legally in\ncompetent and obtaining an annul\nment of her marriage in San Diego\nlast Tuesday to Adrian, were legal\nsteps which Nixon said he is consid\nering. He was in long distance telo\nphone communication with his attor\nney, William F. Humphrey, in New\nYork, and the latter left immediate\nly for the West.\nFrom Monrovia came confirma\ntion last night that Adrian had pur\nchased the Rivers ranch there for\n170,000. The confirmation was fur\nnished by members of the Rivers fam\nily, prominent in southern California\nsociety.\nAdrian and his bride have been\nliving at the Altadena Country Club,\nnear Pasadena, since their return\nfrom San Diego, but they were not at\nhome last night.\nWhen Adrian went to Reno from\nSan Francisco in 1918 to play the\norgan in the new Majestic theatre,\nwhich Mrs. Nixon had built, he posed\nbefore the millionairess as a poor\nyouth unable to pursue his musical\nstudies because of lack of funds. Mrs.\nNixon became interested and furn\nished the money for him to carry on\nhis education.\nLater Adrian began to show large\nsums of money and distribute it lav\nishly in the form oi tips nud in liv\ning a life of luxury. He had auto\nmobiles, jewelry and clothes repre\nsenting thousands of dollars.\nNow Adrian claims he has fallen\nheir to an estate in Spain and that his\nmarriage to Mrs. Nixon, who is 32\nyears his senior, was an affair of the\nheart and not of the purse.\nWith the statement Bert Nixon ut\nterly disagrees. He describes Adrian\nas an impecunious fortune-hunter of\na sordid type and asserts that he has\nan abundance of evidence to prove\nhis statements.\nFINANCIAL CHAOS\nEurope is in a deplorable financial\ncondition and unless some effective\nplan (or the stabilization of exchange\nis effected a reaction In the United\nStates is inevitable, says the Salt\nLake Tribune. As the world’s bank\ner, Uncle Sam is expected to extend\ncredit, but there must be adequate\nsecurity and his own industrial inter\nests must be amply protected. There\nis much uncertainty as to the best\nmethod to be employed and it is\ndoubtful if any decision is reached\nuntil the fate of the peace treaty and\nleague of nations covenant is decided\nby the Senate. According to the lat\nost Paris news, France will attempt\nto float a very large loan in this coun\ntry in terms of dollars rather than\nfrancs. In some quarters it is said\nthe amount and terms of the loan will\nbe two billion dollars for sixty years\nat five per cent with a fifty per cent\nbonus at maturity. The French will\nalso try the London money market\nwith a loan proposition, using the\npound sterling as the unit. The\nBritish banks, however, are not in a\nposition to float any large foreign\nloans. As a matter of fact, they will\nbe doing very well if they succeed in\nfinancing their home industries\nsuch an extent that they may bo a j\nto import the necessary raw ma\nterials.\nThanks to the strength and stability\nof our own financial condition, due\nin great measure to the federal re\nserve bank system, a monetary pan\nic is highly Improbable. But it will\nbe a comparatively easy matter for\nus to lose a large portion of our ex\nport trade, which would inevitably\nresult in a general slowing up of busi\nness and the throwing out of employ\nment of a very large number of work\nmen. As an offset to the diminu\ntion of our foreign trade the sugges\ntion has beeu made that we cease to\nimport luxuries. The advice should\nbe followed until the world settles\ndown to work and the European\ncountries are able to see their way\nclear to pay for our products.\nSome of the speculators In food\nstuffs are losing money as ths result\nof the breakdown in foreign ex\nchange. For instance, egga purchased\nat fifty cents per dosen and placed in\ncold storage in New York are now be\ning thrown upon the market at prices\nranging from forty-fire down to eler\nen cents. Flour has dropped fifty\ncents per barrel in the last day or\ntwo. If there Is to be a general\ndrop in food prices the public will be\nbenefited to some extent, but not\nenough to offset our losses in trade\nand wages. The situation Is abnor\nmal and no man knows exactly what\nis going to happen. The thing to do\nis to sail close to shore until the pres\nent tangle is straightened out.\nThe gamblers of Elko have refused\nto be bound by the recent order of\nthe board of supervisors taxing each\ngame played in the town the sum of\n$100 per month, and are going to\ntake the matter before the people on\na referendum vote. They do not ob\nject to the f 100 tax, but object to the\nmidnight closing hour.\nThere\'s one comfort in the an\nnouncement that the price of tomb\nstones has increased.

FEBRUARY 14. 1920\nFREE SILVER\nSenator Thomas of Colorado Is urg\ning the reestablishment of the old\nratio between gold and silver and the\ncreation of International blmetalism.\nIt Is the belief of Senator Thomas\nthat commercial chaos will soon over\nwhelm International trade unless the\nforeign exchange situation is adjust\ned. Silver has steadily risen in val\nue until gold is now the cheaper met\nal and silver dollars can no longer be\ncoined in this country except at a\nloss. So there is much reason for\nthe assertion of Senator Thomas that\nthe silver coins will go to the metal\npot as fast as they are made and that\nthere will be a fractional currency\nfamine throughout the world unless\nthe ratio be adjusted by internation\nal agreement.\n‘‘The volume of paper money in the\nworld,” says the senator, "is out of\nall proportion to the value of specie,\nand in this condition lies the seat of\nthe international exchange crisis. At\nthe beginning of the world war the\ntotal paper money of the thirty prin\ncipal nations of the world amounted\nto about seven billion dollars, and in\nDecember, 1919, it had increased to\nmore than forty billion dollars, while\nthe gold reserves of the same coun\ntries had remalnead practically sta\ntionary at around seven billion dol\nlars.” It is evident that the old ar\nguments against "the free and un\nlimited coinage of silver at the ratio\nof sixteen to one” have lost some of\ntheir force, now that the white met\nal has been exalted. Yet is is by no\nmeans certain that blmetalism can be\nbrought about. It is certain, how\never, that the subject will be dis\ncussed all over the world and it may\nbe taken up by the league of nations\nif the United States ratifies the Ver\nsailles pact and takes an active part\nIn shaping the future destinies of the\nearth. In any event, there U much\nroom for thought in the suggestion\nof Senator Thomas.—Salt Lake Tri\nbune.\nLLOYD GEORGE TELLS TRUTH\nInflation and Not Profiteering la the\nCause of High Prices\nIn his speech at the opening of the\nnew session of Parliament Premier\nLloyd George said some things which\nare true and of which the world\nshoivld take note. One was that it\nIs not profiteering by a small number\nof individuals which is the cause of\nhlgk prices, but the depreciation of\nthe currency in which the prices are\npaid. Of course, there are profiteers,\nIn the most objectionable sense of\nthat word, but all they can do can\nhave no effect on the price level.\nAnother truth was that Bolshevism\nin Russia cannot be suppressed by\noutside force, even if any country\ncould be found to put up the money,\nwhich is impossible. The applica\ntion of outside force would merely\nsolidify the Russian people and give\nBolshevism a lease of life otherwise\nunattainable. What will kill Bolshe\nvism’ in any country is the general\nprosperity of the people, which can\ncome only from production and trade.\nThe end of Bolshevism will come in\nRussia whenever Lenine and Trotzky\nattempt to apply their theories to a\nprosperous people, and especially to\na prosperous rural peasantry, who\nhave got the land which they were\nafter, intend to keep it, and, more\nover. to do what they please with both\nthe land and its products.\nThere can be no trade without pro\nduction, which must come first, and\nwhat Lloyd George asks is full pro\nduction of food and raw materials in\nRussia ami full production of manu\nfactured goods in England to trade\nfor them. And, if all that can be\nbrought about, there need be no fur\nther worry about Bolshevism in eith\ner country.\nWhat the world needs nowadays\nIs some wizard who can supply $300,\n000,000 a year In silver to India and\nChina and other silver nations; at\nleast 200,000,000 ounces of silver a\nyear to the mints of the world for\ncoinage; about $12,000,000 a year\nsilver backing for at least ten years\nto validate part of the huge Issues of\npaper currency put out during the\nwar; give <0,000,000 ounces to the\nproduction estimated at less than\n2<0,000,000. Ownership of a sllver\nproduclng mine Is a guarantee of\nprosperity for the next few years,\nsays an exchange.\n••fluiHnitl**- |T i— r*‘- *" advance.\nIk\nTHE UJBT NEWS\nThe "Sentinel" to-day re\nceived the following news over\nthe telephone from Palisade,\ntaken from the headings in Fri\nday evening’s papers:\nPresident Wilson and Robert\nIsinsing, Secretary of State, have\ndisagreed, and the latter\'s resig\nnation from the cabinet has been\naccepted.\nThe administration officials\nhave refused to grant any In\ncrease to railroad employees, and\nthe strike railed to go Into effect\nTuesday, February 17, now ap\npears to be certain.\nThe Western Pacific Company\nhas refused to permit the South\nern Pacific further use of Its\ntracks, and the latter company\nIs now preparing to move all\ntrains between Wlnnemucca and\nWells over Its own railway tracks\nbetween those points.\nThe differences between the\nminers and Mine Operators As\nsociation at Tonopah over the\nwuge question was settled satis\nfactorily Friday and it was ar\nranged to resume work In the\nmines to-day (Saturday) There\nwas no strike, but several hun\ndred miners quit work Individu\nally the first of the week and left\nTonopah for other camps.\nAll Eureka stocks on the San\nFrancisco Exchange moved up\nwards to-day.\nROAD OVER SUMMIT\nSTILL IMPASSABLE\nPersistent rumors that the road\nover the Summit ol the Sierras can\nnow be traversed by automobiles,\ncaused Miss Carmen Jewett, secre\ntary of the Nevada Highway Associ\nation, to issue a special bulletin at\nReno Wednesday, stating that the\nroad in its present condition Is abso\nlutely impassable and unsafe for\ntourists.\n“The snow on the summit," Miss\nJewett said, "is from two to three\nfeet deep, and It Is Impossible for an\nautomobile to get through. How\never reports received from Truckee\nindicate that the snow is melting rap\nidly and the road may be open for\ntraffic in a week, providing the pres\nent warm weather continues.”\nBUTTE MINES DON\'T\nNEED MEN, REPORT\nMany miners who are now leaving\nTonopah for Butte, Mont., where a\nhigh scale o( wages is in effect, will\nprobably be disappointed upon their\narrival. The Times was shown a\nletter from the great copper camp\nstating that there are hundreds of\nmen out of work and walking the\nstreets, positions not being available\nfor the inrush of people who have\nbeen flocking there during the past\nfew weeks. While it is true a high\nwage scale is being paid, it is never\ntheless a fact that there are nearly\ntwo men on the ground for every\njob.—Tonopah Times.\nGEORGE GRAHAM RICE\nSENTENCED TO SING SING\nJacob Simon Herzlg, known to the\npolice and the financial world as\nGeorge Graham Rice, has been sen\ntenced by Judge James P. Malane to\nserve three years in Sing Sing, says\nthe New York Evening Sun of Janu\nary 29. He was found guilty of\nstealing $700 in cash and $100 in\nLiberty bonds from Rudolph W.\nHartman, a lawyer of Mansfield, Ohio,\nwhich was forwarded through the\nAmerican Car and Foundry Company.\nHartman never received the money\nor the stock.\nPERT PARAGRAPHS\nIf the parachute does not work you\nwill come down anyhow.\nYou may have observed that a good\ndeal of the inside information finally\ngets outside.\nNo man can understand woman\nwell enough to tell why she wants to\nclean house so often.\nDon’t think that every sad-eyed\nwoman has loved and lost. Perhaps\nshe loved and got him.\nSpeaking of one person trying to\noutstrip the other, there is, for in\nstance, the evening dress.\nEvery girl knows how married\nwomen weep at weddings and yet girls\ngo right on being married.\nA mother is apt to think her own\nboy would be perfect if it were not\nfor the bad boys he has to associate\nwith.\nA good many talk about the psy\nchological moment who don’t know\npsychology from a suspension bridge.\nA fool sometimes gives a fairly\ncorrect imitation of a wise man, but\nhe can\'t make the performance con\ntinuous.\nNo man likes to think that his life\ninsurance is going to be invested in\nanother man, although such things\nhave happened.\nLOCAL BREVITIES\nW.

I was impressed with the slip\nshod manner in which cattlemen, and\nall men for that matter, managed\ntheir business, and after thinking\nabout It for a long time I thought\nthere was no reason why I should not\nget in the game myself. I wanted to\ndo something. I took the matter up\nwith my husband and he was abso\nlutely opposed to my starting in the\nsheep business. \'Why, none of these\ncatttlemen around here will speak to\nus,’ he said. But I did not bother\nabout that. I knew that they would\nbe glad to speak to me if 1 had the\ndollars, which, after all, do a lot of\ntalking.\nBanker Dubious\n“Jly banker was dubious about my\nsuccess, but they finally bought me a\nband of sheep at $2.75 apiece. They\nwere a sick looking bunch, too. but I\ndid not know any better then. I\nnursed those sheep and managed\nevery detail of their management my\nself. When I told my banker that\nmy lambs would weigh over seventy\npounds he thought I was insane. He\nwas willing to bet me a new hat that\nIambs that heavy could not be raised\nin Lemhi County.

This is a\nhard season with the sheep raisers.\nMy husband laughed at me when he\nwent to California and said that his\ncattle would probably have to pay\nthe costs of running my sheep this\nWinter. I will be mighty lucky, as\nevery other sheep raiser will agree, if\nI break even this Winter, for many,\nmany sheepmen are going to go to\nthe wall before Spring.\nVision Counts\n“I started in with one band of\nsheep and I had such a job managing\nthem that I thought I never could\nrun five bands, but as I was able to\nbuy more sheep I was better able to\nmanage them, and last Winter I ran\nsix bands. I am running now about\n7000 sheep. I cleaned out a lot be\nfore the Winter feeding started be\ncause I did not like the prospect of\nhaving men in the hay business get\nting wealthy on my money, for they\nare getting rich at the expense of the\nsheepmen this year.\n“Any woman can do big things if\nshe has a big vision. I saw the ro\nmance in raising sheep. When I\nsend a long train of sheep to the mar\nket I have a thrill of pride which can\nnot be equaled by an artist who has\njust painted a wonderful picture. I\nhave been able to give my daughters\nmany of the things for which I longed\nwhen I was a girl. I wanted to be a\nsuccessful writer and the realization\nof my literary dreams has only been\nrealized in writing items about sheep\nraising in the live stock journals.”\nA»k» Congress To l*ut\nMen On Nevada Land\nCarson City, Nevada, February 11.\n—A resolution urging immediate ap\npropriations for settlements of ex\nservice men on Nevada lands was\ndrafted at the conference held here\nby representatives of the American\nLegion and prominent landowners of\nNevada.
