South Carolina, did, not\nattend the bnaquet given In honor of\nPrince Henry at the White Hoase to\nnight. President Roosevelt had Invited\nthe senator to attend, as he U the\nranking minority member of the naval\naffairs committee. After the sensation\nal scene of Saturday, when Tillman\nand hi colleague, McLaurln, came, to\nblow, the president felt that Tillman\nshould not be a guest at the dinner,\nand that hla presence would not only\nbe an affront to the senate, but a dis\ncourtesy to Prince Henry as well. He\ncalled 8enator Cockrell, of Missouri, to\nthe White House, and asked blm to\nsuggest to Tillman that he decline the\ninvitation. Senator Cockrell, a warn\npersonal friend of Tillman, did as the\npresident requested, but Tillman re\nfused to decline the Invitation. When\nSenator Cockrell told the president of\nthe South Carotlnan\'s action, the in\nvitation ws cancelled by direction of\nRoosevelt.

IDENTIFYING CRIMINALS.\ni ; - \' ";\nMajor fiytvester, chief ot poUc ot\nWashington City, has promoted a na\ntional movement for the Identification\not criminals. It ia proposed that there\nshall be co-operation between the po\nlice and detective organisations of\nth rauntrv bv which the criminal\nnoouiitlon shall fee known, marked\naad located. . A there are many crim\ninal occupations, the people who tot\nlow each will be listed therein, their\npersonality will be noteo and their In\ndividual Idiosyncrasies recorded as\nshown in their methods ot operating.\nThis wiH result In mafcins known to\ntne officers of each city all the crim\ninal therein and the lines on which\nthey operate. It criminal be com\nmitted all known criminals who pur\nsue that line wiU be put under espion\nage, and the probability ot the deed\nhaving been committed by an outside\ner wi cause inquiry elsewhere to see\nif e criminal In that line has migrated\nto new field. .\nWith such a system in owrallor if\na criminal like the murder of Mias\nFuller be committed the police will\nknow all the people In the city whose\npast conduct has exposed them to sus\npicion ot such a deed and they will\nbe rounded up as suspects, no mat\nter what may be their standing, says\nthe Ban Francisco Call. -\nThe detective force of a large city\nhas extraordinary . opportunities for\nknow lag the Jekyll .and Hyde sides\nof life. It has the means ot noting\nthe habits of men who may practice\nthat sinister form of crime. It may\nMentify every psychopath and abnor\nmal and degenerate creature in the\n. city, and. as such crimes\' are trace\nable always to that class, every mem\nber of it may be compelled to account\nfor his whereabouts at the time of the\noffense and to furnish means by which\nhe may be exculpated or convicted.\n. It Is one of the unfortunat features\nin the psychology of civilisation that\ndegeneracy appears in that awful\nform. It prevailed In all the high civ\nilisations of the ancient world, except\npossibly among the Greeks. All of the\nrefinements of modern civilization\nhave not prevented its appearance.\nIt to of such a nature as to require\nan enlargement of Jet -i.nl \'e training.\nEvery detective force may well have\na medical division, it which men are\nU. lined as medical detectives and the\nregular profession, by giving the of\nficer the benefit of Snowledge that\nmay be acquired -aly by the practi\ntioner, may give needei and powerful\nawistance In the fixing of such crimes\nupon their perpetrators.\nThe density of our population is in\ncreasing and the percentage of people\nwho live in cities is sa ving rapidly\nupon the rural population It Is where\nhumanity Is herded together that\ncrime flourishes and degeneracy is\nfound displaying its most revolting\nfeatures.. Fo these reasons erl me must\nbe sought, exposed and punished In\nthe cities. The majority of burglaries,\nhighway robberies, homicides, bank\nrobberies, offenses " against , women,\npocket picking, snea thieving and eth\ner offenses ooeuf hi icKleai - \' \'\nIt is Interesting ,to note that cases\nof judicial and executive leniency have\noften\' a tendency \' (to promote .some\nforms of crime. It has been noted\nthat bank robberies have greatly mul\ntiplied since the parole of the Younger\nbrothers in Mlinesota.\' They were pro\nfessional bank, robbers, in robbing a\nMinnesota bank, many years, ago. they\nmurdered the cashier who bad bravely\ndefended his trust.. Instead of being\nhanged a sentimental Jury gave them\nlife imprisonment, and after tlie lapse\nof years the legislature was induced\nto paas a special act to permit tbelr\nexit from the penitentiary. Of course\nno one suspected that they had any\ndesire\' to return to bank-robbing.\nThey are reported to have made prop\ner use of their liberty. But the fact\nof their enlargement has neen taken\nby their Imitators as an official ex\npression that modifies the turpitude\nof bank-robbing, and since It occurred\nthere has been a regular epidemic of\nbank-robbing. In which many Uvea\nhave been lost and but few arrests\nhave been made.\nThe protection of. society requires\nthat detective machinery be reinforc\ned by every possible means for identi\nfying every member ot the criminal\npopulation, and that the tuntshment\nof criminals be not interfered with\nby the Intrusion of maudlin sentiment.\nTHREE COMING STATES.\nIt is considered probable that before\nthe next presidential election takes\nplace the number of states will be In\ncreased to forty-eight This wouiu\nadd certainly four, and possibly five,\nvotes to the electoral college. . Okla\nhoma, the youngest and most popu\nlous of ths territories, has people suffi\ncient In number to entitle it to two\nrepresentatives In the lower house of\ncongress. Th census ot 1900 gave her\na population of S9S.00O, and the pres\nent estimate is iSO.OO New Mexico\nhad 14,000 people in ISO, and at pres\nent the population does not vary much\nfrom that figure. Arlsona lacks sev\neral thousand people of the unit of\nrepresentation In the states m the\nhouse, but there are precedents foe\nthe admission ot states with fewer\npeople than are required In the old\nstates to constitue a congressional dis\ntrict New Mexico has been cenled\nadmission for the reason that its pop\nulation, (hough of native Urth, had\nnot acquired the American language.\nThat territory was acquired by the\ntreaty that gave us several other Am\nerican states, but the Mexican popu\nlation was so large that Americans\nhave been slow in establishing their\nlanguage and customs. In recent years\ngood progress has been made in that\ndirection, and the people of both na\ntionalities are anxious to be admitted\ninto the union.\nThe populous old states do not ob\nject to the small addition the admis\nsion of these three territories would\nmake to the number of members of\nthe house, but they do object to the\nsix senators\' who, collectively, would\nrepresent less than 900,000 people. New\nYork with a population of 7,000,100 has\nbut two senators, while the three ter\nritories mentioned. If admitted as\nstates, would I entitled to six sena\ntors. But these populous old states\nmake op in influence what they lack\nin votes in the senate.\nY Tho\nnappy\nHOittQm\nNOMINATING A SENATOR.\nSays the Pendleton East Oregonlan:\nAn esteemed Eastern Oregon Demo\ncrat, William Smith, state senator\nfrom Baker county, has said to the\nDaily Democrat of Baker ?ity:\n"I al?o found that a number of peo\nple object to the nomination of any\nindividual for the United States ena\ntorship on grounds that it gives an\nopportunity to the big corporations to\nt determine whether or not they could\nuse him and if not they could com\nbine to defeat him.-\'\nCertainly, Senator Smith cannot\nsupport this declaration to its logical\nconclusion. If the people should con\nceal their candidates for the United\nStates senate from the corporations\nbetween the time when the nominat\ning conventions are held and the time\nwhen the elections occur, then why\nshould not the candidates for \'.he oth\ner offices also be kept in the back\nground, dark horses, as it were, for\nfear the corporations will ascertain\ntheir views, and, if hostile, defeat\nthem? Are we so securely within the\ngrasp of the corporations that we\nmust as a sovereign people conceal our\nIntentions from them? The Inference\non the part of Senator Smith Is not\nworthy, that open, frank, outspoken,\nfearless man. And it is not in ac\ncordance with the views of the people\nof the country, who want that much\nof a step towards the election of Unit\ned States senators by direct vote of\nthe people.\n.- The. people should not have to go\nabout their election because in mor\ntal fear of corporations. It Is really\nan attitude ot cowardice, and Is not\nconsistent with the grandeur of our\nelectorate. When our citizenship\ncomes to a point when they must con\nceal their desires from the corpora\ntions and slink along with "cards up\ntheir sleeves," then may the republic\nbe dissolved and our boasted liber\nties no more be heralded to the\nworld.\nLouisville Courier-Journal: General\nPearson should be wary how he car\nries the Boer war Into the New Or\nleans camps.
