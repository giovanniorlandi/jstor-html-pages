        <pre>['The Tragedy of American Aid\nTheragedyofAmericanid\nSaturday, 13 March 1948, Weekly News Commentary on Current International\nIssues, 9.15pm 2BL\nUS Congressmen got into their stride recently in delaying tactics on the Marshall\nPlan, tactics ranging from confusing the issues with those of aid to Greece, Turkey\nand China, to proposals to leave it all to private enterprise, to crude filibusters.\nAs the conviction grew that the bill would not pass by its due date of 1 April,\nthe communist members of the Czech government and parliament took power by\na swift coup. In Italy the general election campaign gave signs of an impending\nconstitutional victory of the Italian communists at the polls.\nSo, on Tuesday last, US Secretary of State Marshall called personally on the\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives to urge expedition. And yesterday the\nPresident himself, urged haste, in a special message, asking for further interim aid\nto tide over the further delay. Talk of imminent war with the Soviet Union, and a\nquickening tempo followed. The Senate is holding a special Saturday session at this\nvery hour.\nThere symbolically, is the tragedy of American aid to Europe and indeed, of\nAmerican foreign policy—my subject for tonight.\nThis however, must be said at the outset. Never before has one people extended\nto the rest of the world economic aid on the scale extended by the American people\nsince 1942.\nLeave aside the tens of billions of Lend-Lease aid if you will. Say, as Roosevelt\nnobly said, that America was there only contributing to the common struggle according\nto her abilities, as other nations did. Even then, Americans have spent,\nsince Victory in Europe Day, more than 11 billion dollars to aid European recovery,\nand lent Europe another eight billion dollars. That, mind you, is without Marshall\naid, whether interim or final.\nThat is no mean or sordid contribution; it is a noble one. Nor was its primary\ninspiration other than noble and far seeing. Yet, after this 20 billion and more was\ngone, Europe’s salvation was as distant as ever.\n210\n', 'When I spoke on the Marshall Plan nine months ago, I had to qualify my warm\npraise of it by the foreboding that it had come too late for Europe. Today, nine\nmonths later, Congress is still debating the plan.\nWhy is it that past and future American aid, so bold in scale and inspiration,\ndoes not come in time, and does not fulfil its purposes? There, perhaps, without\nexaggeration, is the most important question of the mid-century.\nIn sketching an answer for you, I want you to remember my opening words,\nand to remember too, that having lived in America for six years, I have a great affection\nfor its people, and a great admiration for the generosity and vision that is\nto be found among them.\nBut American folk, and American politics, like those of all other nations, are\nnot all simple, or uniform or according to the best sample. The failures of past aid\nare largely due to the frustrating pressures by men and groups who do not come\nup to sample. Let me enumerate some of the causes.\nFirst, America, due to pressure for a return to normalcy and economy, ended\nthe war with no comprehensive plan to restore Europe’s economy. Indeed, she precipitately\ncut off Lend-Lease from countries like Britain. This was like sending an\nincipient pneumonia patient out to work for a week in the rain, before beginning\ntreatment. When the treatment began in the form of the great loan to Britain, pressure\ngroups again got to work for the lifting of wartime controls, especially price\ncontrols. The result was that the loan to Britain, fixed at four billion dollars on a\ncareful calculation of Britain’s needs of dollar goods, was worth little over two billion\nwithin a year of it being granted. The pressure groups, which led Congress to\nlift controls, did not intend to sabotage American aid—but that was the effect.\nNot only in this respect either. For the determination of American business\nto make the best of the boom in both home and export markets meant that, even\nwhen they had dollars, the distressed countries could not compete with American\nproducers in buying American machinery. Machines promised for 1948 could\nnot help European recovery in 1946. America criticised Britain for not spending\nmore of the loan on machinery. The fact is, as Mr Herbert S Morrison told the\nCommons, the machinery was simply not available for European countries, even\nthough its production in America was at the highest level ever.\nAll this we must note, is without regard to more sinister interpretations. Mr\nMarshall’s indignation yesterday against the impugning of basic American motives\nin justified. It is American opposition to this plan, rather than support of it, which\nis sinister. But in neither case are the sinister factors decisive.\nThe question is why in pursuance of this American foreign policy, as vital to\nAmerica as to Europe, many Americans constantly fail (thus far at least) to overcome\nsuch sinister factors till too late.\nThe answer lies in the structure of US government. One of America’s great Secretaries\nof State once wrote: ‘The Secretary of State exists only to recognise the\nexistence of a world which Congress would rather ignore.’ That made difficulties\neven in Henry Adams’ time; but today, when America faces unprecedented world\nresponsibilities, its implications are terrifying.\nThe Tragedy of American Aid\n211\n', 'Neither the Secretary of State nor the President automatically command a\nworking majority in Congress, as a British government must in Parliament. They\nare not responsible to Congress in that sense, and conversely they cannot crack the\nwhip and push a foreign policy through.\nAnd when that foreign policy requires financial action, it becomes at every\nstage subject to the pressures, sectional interests, prejudices and straight ignorance,\nwhich weigh upon Congressmen. And even only a minority of Congressmen, supported\nby only a few pressure groups, can wreck the noblest plan.\nPast experiences shows that if Marshall aid, when approved, is to be effective,\nimportant controls over the American economy will be required—the power to\ncontrol exports and some imports, the power to control production for domestic\nmarkets, and control of rail and sea transportation. Above all, controls must ensure\nthat more machinery, and fewer consumer goods are made available for Europe,\nthus changing radically the character of the American export drive over the last\ntwo years.\nCongress has been induced to restore some of these powers to the President.\nThat is an important step even though the President has undertaken to use them\nsparingly and drop them as soon as possible. But the question remains whether\nthey will be adequate and whether congressional and popular education can be\nbrought to and kept at a point in which it will tolerate such exercise. Four years,\nwith intervening presidential and congressional elections, is a long time for pressure\ngroups to tolerate controls, which they caused to be dismantled at the war’s\nend.\nHenry Adams, then, gave us the key to the tragedy of American aid. There always\nwill be large elements in Congress who prefer, in his words, to ignore the\nworld. Only a Pearl Harbor could bring Congress to decision, even under Roosevelt’s\ninspired leadership. And only cries like the threat of communism, or events\nlike those in Czechoslovakia, can be counted on to ensure congressional action today.\nYet such cries tend to defeat the basic inspiration behind American aid, and\nsuch events are only too often a sign that the aid comes too late.\nA wise long-term plan to help European peoples over difficulties, which\nthreaten disaster, thus becomes converted by the American political structure into\nan emergency plan to salvage the wreck. What Europe needs is aid timed to save\ndemocracy, rather than salvage it from the wreckage.\nLetters to Australia: Volume 2\n212\n']</pre>
