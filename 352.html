        <pre>['Published April, 1946\nOPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF \nAGRONOMISTS: DOMESTIC ASPECTS 1 \nRICHARD BRADFIELD2 \nTHE object of the American Society of Agronomy, as expressed in its Constitution, is to increase and disseminate the knowledge of \nsoils and field crops. A glance at our program this year will indicate \nhow diverse these problems have become. We have within our membership\npractically all of the leading soil scientists of America-men \nskilled in all phases of this complex science, which is basic to all \nagriculture. \nThe responsibilities of the soil scientist and his importance in our \nnational life is obvious to all who take time to stop and to think. \nThese responsibilities are especially great because this group, probably\nto a greater extent than any other, must supply the technical \nguidance regarding the utilization of our soil resources which will \nresult in the most economic production of the crops required now and \nat the same time maintain their productivity so that the future of our \nchildren is secure. The goal of this group is w~ll stated in the title of \nthe book which has exerted so much influence on the thinking of a \ngeneration of agriculturists, Cyril ]. Hopkins\' "Soil Fertility and \nPermanent Agriculture." A short sojourn into areas of badly depleted \nsoils either at home or abroad will awaken in the mind of anv observant,\nthinking man the weight of the responsibility and the opportuni-\nty for service which lies ahead of the soil scientist in the United States. \nSome of you may regard this an understatement, but certainly \nmost of you will agree that the responsibilities and opportunities, \npresent and future, of the crop scientists are almost as great. In this \ngroup are to be found the men who have the technical skills necessary \nfor the development of improved strains of many of our most important\ncrops-corn, cotton, wheat, oats, barley, hay, pasture, etc.-and \nthe men skilled in the other techniques necessary for their efficient \nproduction. It would, perhaps, be simpler to approach the subject of \nthe scope of our responsibilities from the other direction and ask, "If \nyou take all the agronomy, all the soils, and all the farm crops out of \nagriculture, what do you have left?" I think I have said enough to at \nleast convince us of our importance and of the broad scope of our \nresponsibilities in both the present and the future of our country. \nI would like to have you consider next the vertical scope of our \nresponsibilities. To date we have been concerned primarily with research,\nresident teaching at the college level, and extension. We have \nbeen accused of being primarily a rather academic organization. The \ntime has come for us to ask ourselves whether we want to remain \nsuch or whether we can serve society better by extending our activities\ninto areas which up until now we have not seriously cultivated. \n1Presented at the annual meeting of the Society in Columbus, Ohio, February \n28, 1946. \n\'Professor of Soil Technolog-y and Head, Department of Ag-ronomy, Cornell \nUniversity, Ithaca, N.Y. \n299 \n', 'JOO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOClETY OF AGRONOMY \nI am convinced that the future will be characterized by increasing \nspecialization in all phases ofour agricultural education program. The \nperiod in which the county agent or the vocational agriculture teacher \ncan cover the entire field of agriculture is already drawing to a close. \nSixty years ago we had Professors of Agriculture in many of our \nuniversities! In many of our wealthier agricultural counties we already\nhave county agents who specialize in a relatively narrow field \nof subject matter. Certain of these men devote a high proportion of \ntheir time to p1;oblems arising in connection with the production of a \nsingle crop. At the present time few of the men engaged as either \ncounty agents or teachers ofvocational agriculture have any training \nbeyond that required for a B. S. degree in Agriculture. Farmers are \nbetter trained than they used to be. The men they hire, directly or \nindirectly to give them professional help in the future, must be better \ntrained than they have been in the past. One of the fields in which \nmany of these men must be given more specialized training is agronomy.\nIf this group must obtain specialized training, they must be \nurged· and required to keep informed regarding new developments in \ntheir special field. How can this be done more effectively than by \nhaving these men as members of our organization, taking an active \npart it) our regional, state and occasionally even national conferences, \nreading regularly and· contributing occasionally to our professional \npublications? If the objective of our Society is to increase and spread \nthe knowledge of soils and .crops, have we fulfilled our obligation to \nsociety until the knowledge we have won by costly and painstaking \nresearch is applied on the farms of the country? \nLet us consider for a while some of the trends, many of them accelerated\nby the war, which will have an effect upon the work of agrono-\nmists. \n1st. Farm labor will probably continue scarce and relatively high \npriced, especially in the more heavily industrialized sections of the \ncountry. The proportion of our total population needed on farms will \ncontinue to decrease tors%, perhaps even to ro%, of our total population.\nThis trend will intensify the demand for agronomic practices \nwhich will save labor. \n2nd. There will be an increase in the amount of power available on \nfarms. In many sections of the country electricity will be almost universally\navailable for heat, light, and power at rates of I to 2 cents \nper kilowatt hour or even less. \nI have stood on the banks of the mighty St. Lawrence, outlet to our \nchain of Great Lakes, and watched her turbulent flow to the sea, \nwasting day and night, year in and year out, the strength of 2,5oo,ooo \nhorses, the mechanical equivalent of over 25,ooo,ooo men. On \nthousands of nearby farms men are still doing many back-breaking, \ntime-consuming jobs in the ways of their fathers. Within a relatively \nshort time this immense source of power will be harnessed and at the \nfinger tips of these farmers. In the Valley of the Tennessee, the \nColumbia, the Missouri, the Colorado, the Sacramento, and numerous\nother rivers, the situation is similar. Where "white coal" is lacking, \nblack coal can take its place. The more I think of the farm labor \nproblem of the future, the more I am convinced that the farm hands \nthat have been responsible for so many production miracles on \n', 'BRADFIELD: DOMESTIC ASPECTS OF AGRONOMY 30I \nAmerican farms during the war will play an even greater role in the \nfuture. I refer to H.(orse) P.(ower) Hour and his brother K.(ilo) \nW.(att) Hour. The reasons are obvious when one contrasts present \nand probable future trends in use of these two elements in agricultural\nproduction: \nLabor is: Power is: \nI. Demanding higher wages I. Offering cheaper rates \n2. Demanding shorter hours 2. Offering 24-hour service \n3. Becoming more narrowly 3. Becoming more diversified in \nspecialized usage \n4· Demanding better housing 4· Content with low standards \n5· Eating whether working or idles. Eating only when working \n6. Demanding social security for 6. Content to be junked when \nold age worn out \nIs it not obvious then that our thinking, our research, our operations\nmust be projected to farms which will have all the power they \ncan use at rates of a cent or two per kilowatt hour? Think of what that \nmeans, those of you who can recall long days of hard back-breaking \nwork on the farm! Think of it again in terms of present prices of farm \nlabor-the mechanical equivalent of eight to ten men, ready to work \nday and night for a cent an hour! It will call for much team work \nwith our colleagues in agricultural engineering-team work which we \n• have already found profitable in other fields. \n3rd. Our chemical industry, greatly expanded during the war, will \nplace on the market hundreds ofnew products and many old products \nat new low prices, ni.any of which may be capable of modifying present \nprocedures of soil and crop management. I shall cite only a few examples.\nWe are now making 25,ooo,ooo pounds of D.D.T. a year. Before \nthe war we made none. Entomologists report tests made this year in \nwhich potato yields have been increased by over 1oo bushels per acre, \nan increase about equal to the average potato yield of the United \nStates, by two to three relatively inexpensive sprays with this marvelous\nnew chemical. Increases of 300 to 4oo% in the yield of seed of \ncertain forage legumes have recently been reported. Advances of this \ntype have come after only two years of experimentation and with only \nlimited amounts of D.D.T. available! If we are to capitalize fully \nupon the improvements in insect and disease control made by our \ncolleagues in entomology, plant pathology, and plant breeding, our \nsoils must be maintained at a higher level of fertility. A soil capable \nof meeting the full demands of a flea bitten, disease ridden crop of \npotatoes of 100 bushels per acre may soon be the factor limiting the \nproduction of an improved strain of potatoes in which both disease \nand insect injury are prevented. If we can produce the amounts of \nthese various crops needed on a much smaller acreage, shifts in our \ncropping systems and our entire pattern of land use may be involved. \nThe development of selective herbicides like 2, 4-D also opens up a \nnew field with great possibilities. New methods of weed control will \ncall for changes in tillage practices. Chemicals capable of destroying \nexisting sods may enable us to introduce improved strains of grasses \nand legumes into our immense.acreage of nonplowable pasture. \n', '302 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOClETY OF AGRONOMY \nThe nitrogen fixation capacity of the world, .particularly that of the \nUnited States, has changed markedly during the war. The great \nchange in the world nitrogen situation recalls the oft quoted presidential\naddress made by Sir William Crookes before the British Associa-\ntion for the Advancement of Science in 1898.3 In the course of this \naddress he stated, "I have passed in review all the wheat-growing \ncountries of the world, with the exception of those whose united supplies\nare so small as to make little appreciable difference to the argu-\nment. The situation may be summed up briefly thus: The world\'s \ndemand for wheat-the leading bread-stuff-increases in a crescendo \nratio year by year. Gradually all the wheat-bearing land on the globe \nis appropriated to wheat-growing, until we are within measurable \ndistance of using the last available acre. We must then rely on nitrogenous\nmanures to increase the fertility of the land under wheat, so \n·as to raise the yield from the world\'s low average- I 2. 7 bushels per \nacre-to a higher average. To do this efficiently and feed the breadeater\nfor a few years will exhaust all the available store of nitrate of \nsoda. For years past we have been spending fixed nitrogen at a culpably\nextravagant rate, heedless of the fact that it is fixed with ex-\ntreme slowness and difficulty, while its liberation in the free state \ntakes place always with rapidity and sometimes with explosive violence.\n"Some years ago Mr. Stanley Jevons uttered a note of warning \nas to the near exhaustion of our British coalfields. But the exhaustion \nof the world\'s stock of fixed nitrogen is a matter of far greater importance.\nIt means not only a catastrophe little J>hort of starvation for \nthe wheat-eaters, but indirectly, scarcity for those who exist on inferior\ngrains, together with a lower standard of living for meat-eaters, \nscarcity of mutton and beef, and even the extinction of gunpowder! \n"There is a gleam of light amid this darkness of despondency. In its \nfree state nitrogen is one of the most abundant and pervading bodies \non the face of the earth. Every square yard of the earth\'s surface has \nnitrogen gas pressing down on it to the extent of about seven tonsbut\nthis is in the \'free\' state, and wheat demands it \'fixed\' .......... . \n"The fixation of atmospheric nitrogen therefore is one of the great \ndiscoveries awaiting the ingenuity ofchemists. It is certainly deeply \nimportant in its practical bearings on the future welfare and happiness \nof the civilized races of mankind. This unfulfilled problem, which so \nfar has eluded the strenuous attempts of those who have tried to wrest \nthe secret from nature, differs materially from other chemical discoveries\nwhich are in the air, so as to speak, but are not yet matured. The \nfixation of nitrogen is vital to the progress of civilized humanity. \nOther discoveries minister to our increased intellectual comfort, \nluxury, or convenience; they serve to make life easier, to hasten \nthe acquisition of wealth, or to save time, health, or worry. The \nfixation of nitrogen is a question of the not far distant future. Unless \nwe can class it among certainties to come the great Caucasian race will \ncease to b~ foremost in the world, and will be squeezed out of existence\nby races to whom wheaten bread is not the staff of life." \nIn the less than so years since these words were uttered, we have \n•Presidential Address by Sir William Crookes at the meeting of the British \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science in 1898. (Page 17.) \n', 'BRADFIELD: DOMESTIC ASPECTS OF AGRONOMY 303 \nengaged in two world wars. Before the first was started Germany had \na plant using the Haber process in operation and was thus rendered \nindependent of the Chilean nitrate deposits for explosives. The rest of \nthe world followed quickly. Our total domestic capacity for turning out \nnitrogen compounds suitable for use as fertilizers is now between 2 and \n3 times our maximum pre-war consumption. \nWhen I was just starting on my first job in the field of agronomy,. \njust after the close of the first world war, I remember hearing a former\nPresident of this Society, Professor M. F. Miller, make the state-\nment that, "Nitrogen might soon be available at ro cents a pound and \nthat at that price we could probably afford to use it in many places \nwhere its use had been prohibitive because of cost." Since that time, \nnitrogen has been available in wholesale lots at about half of that \nprice and we are again raising the same question which Professor Miller\nraised 2 5 years ago! \nThe war has given increased impetus to another trend which was \nslowly developing before the war. In the years ahead, this trend will \nbecome a necessity in many fields of agronomy. I refer to the necessity\nfor teamwork in the solution of our increasingly complex prob-\nlems. I do not mean that the "lone genius" will disappear. I hope not! \nBut I feel we cannot rely solely on him to pull us through. \nThis growing trend has been discussed by Jewett and King4 of the \nBell Telephone Research Laboratories as follows: \'\'The basic fact is \nthat more and more, due to his inherent limitations, the lone worker is \nbeing replaced by a carefully chosen corps whose various talents dovetail\ntogether and whose collective knowledge and collective analytical \npowers greatly exceed those of any single member of the group. When \nworking as a unit, the capabilities of such a group, measured by \nresults, are likely to exceed by a considerable margin the sum of any \nindividual achievements possible to its members. In essence of course \nit is simply the division of labor applied in the intellectual field. \n"To make this fact a little more evident it might be mentioned that \nthe laboratory with which the authors are associated comprises about \n4,5oo employees, one half of whom are skilled scientists and technicians,\nwhile the remainder include very essential laboratory assistants \nand service groups. Experience speaks so strongly that today no verbal\nargument is needed to justify the existence of such a centralized \nresearch and development organization. No single individual, nor indeed\na widely scattered but equal nuinber of individuals, could hope \nto match the analytical and creative powers which such a laboratory, \nlong accustomed to mutual effort, can focus upon its chosen field. \n"There are other reasons, however, and equally cogent one~, for \nbelieving that the time has come when a nation must institute a mass \nintellectual attack upon its social and political problems. \n"As is universally recognized, the basis of the experimental method \nin science is deliberate control of the factors and parameters which \nenter any problem. This is quite possible when dealing with the inanimate,\nbut by and large there will be scant opportunity for the em-\nployment of such arbitrariness when studying the questions involving \nanimate creations. This limitation assuredly makes the approach \n•Science, 92:368. 1940. \n', '304 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nmore difficult but does not rule out the attractiveness of the mass attack;\nif anything, it makes it more imperative. \n"In conclusion, it seems likely that we are well launched upon an \nera during which all the existing advisory aids to the government, as \nwell as others still to be created, will have to function with increasing \nvigor. Such an arrangement need not savor of bureaucracy. The \nsovereign people will still remain sovereign. But belated and constructive\nrecognition will have been given to the fact, now abundant-\nly clear, that the day is gone, and probably forever, when a successful \nstate can base its policies upon clamor of pressure groups or upon the \nuniformed beliefs of the majority, even though measured numerically \nby tens of millions.\'\' \nThis is neither the time nor place to point out in detail specific \nproblems awaiting the attention of agronomists. I shall for that reason \nmention only a few which seem to me to be of broad general interest. \nWork with hybrid corn has indicatetl how plastic plant protoplasm · \nis in the hands of our plant breeders. It has also shown that many valuable\nhybrids grow best in only a rather restricted environment. We \nhave a wide range of soil and climatic conditions in the United States. \nFor best results in the future we shall need to do a better job of fitting \nour more sensitive, highly productive strains of crops to soil and \nmicroclimate. \nAll phases of grassland agriculture will be markedly improved in \nthe next decade. Less progress has been made in this field than in most \ntypes of farming. Much basic research is under way. More attention \nis being given to breeding improved strains of forage grasses and \nlegumes than ever before. We are learning more about managing \ngrasslands. The losses in nutritional value in curing and storing hay \nand silage for winter feeding are still inexcusably large. The labor involved\nin getting hay and silage from field to manger is still too high. \nThere is a great opportunity here for substituting cheap power for \nexpensive labor. Active research along these lines is in progress at \nseveral institutions. \nMuch remains to be done to clarify conflicting evidence on the \neffect of various environmental factors on the nutritional quality of \nmany crops. We cannot yet predict with sufficient accuracy the quality\nof crops we can produce under various circumstances. We frequent-\nly fail to get differences where we expected them and occasionally get \nthem where they were unexpected. \nThe problems of the teacher of agronomy will be bigger and more \ndiversified in the future. Time will permit the discussion of only one \nphase of this problem, that of the supply of men trained to the Ph.D. \nlevel in agriculture. The following remarks are based on a study of the \nsituation in the field of agriculture and forestry as a whole. The conclusions\napply to agronomy with full force. 5 \nThere was a shortage of well-trained men in the agricultural \nsciences before the war. Throughout the last decade before the war, \nthe demand for men trained to the Ph.D. level in the various fields of \nagriculture expanded more rapidly than the supply. The passage of \n•These remarks are based upon a study made by the Committee on Training \nResearch Workers in Agriculture of the National Research Council in 1945· \n', "BRADFlELD: DOMESTIC ASPECTS OF AGRONOMY 305 \n· the Bankhead-Janes Law made available to both the U.S. Dept. of \nAgriculture and the states, funds for expanding work already under \nway and in addition led to the establishment of many new and very \nlarge research laboratories for studying problems of regional interest, \nespecially problems connected with the industrial utilization of surplus \nagricultural products. During this period the Soil Conservation Service\nand several other federal agricultural agencies were established \nand rapidly expanded. There was also a great increase in the demand \nfor industrial products made from the raw materials of farm and \nforest or designed for service in these fields. All these developments \nled to an increased demand for men with technical training in agriculture.\n·On the outbreak of war many of the members of the staffs of these \ninstitutions and organizations were called from their regular jobs to \nperform services of more urgent importance in connection with the \nwar effort. The training of men in the agricultural sciences at all levels, \nfrom the freshman to the Ph.D., was greatly curtailed and in sor:ne institutions\ncompletely stopped. Institutions operated with skeletal \nstaffs. Many have passively assumed that with the end of the war at \nleast normal pre-war conditions would be restored. It is now obvious \nthat even this mild optimism is not justified. Vacancies in one institution\nare being filled largely by creating vacancies in another. Industry \nis getting many of its more able men in this field by outbidding the \ncolleges and the Federal Government for their services. In many institutions\nbadly needed research, for which ample funds have already \nbeen provided, is at a standstill because men with the necessary \ntraining are not available. While all concerned with this problem are \nconvinced that it is very serious and that something should be done \nto increase the supply of men technically trained in agriculture, information\non the probable magnitude of the postwar demands and of \nthe probable deficit in the supply of such men is lacking. A committee \nof the National Research Council has attempted to bring together \nsuch information and estimates as could be readily assembled. \nThe National Roster lists 6,903 men with the doctor's degree in \nthe biological and agricultural sciences. The specialized fields listed \nunder this heading are in part clearly in agriculture, in part clearly in \nsome fields other than agriculture, and in part split between agriculture\nand some other field, particularly medicine. From a study of this \ntabulation the committee estimated that approximately half of the \ntotal number, or about 3,5oo men, with a doctor of philosophy degree \nare now engaged in various phases of work in agriculture and forestry. \nThe replies to a questionnaire sent to the deans of the colleges of \nagriculture and schools of forestry indicate that these institutions will \nneed about 1,350 men with doctor's degrees within the next five years \nand an additional I,Izo men within the second five-year period, making\na total of z ,4 70 men for the next decade. An analysis of the material \nsupplied from the Department of Agriculture indicates that their \nneeds will amount to about 1,3 70 men. The estimate submitted by the \nTechnical Collaboration Branch of the Office of Foreign Agricultural \nRelations indicates that they have on hand at the present time a \ndemand for 240 men for the next two years. These three items total \n4,o8o men. \n", "306 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nAs indicated above, the committee was not able to obtain any accurate\nestimate of the probable demand for men with advanced \ntraining in agriculture and forestry in all the many fields outside those \nlisted above. We are certain, however, that this is a very important \nfield. Many of the deans reported that they were feeling the competition\nof industry for men on their staffs. Practically all the industrial \nmen contacted indicated that they were planning to increase the number\nof technically trained men on their staffs as soon as they could be \nobtained. When one considers the advances that have been made in \nindustrial utilization of-agricultural and forest products or in the development\nof new products for which there is an agricultural outlet, \nfor example new developments in fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, \nherbicides, feeds, farm machinery, new developments in food processing,\nfarmers' cooperatives, canners, manufacturing of dairy products, \nnew products and techniques in wood utilization, it is clear that these \noutlets will in the future constitute a substantial part of the entire demand.\nIn this summary (Table r) this demand has been estimated to \nbe 25% of the total demand from the three sources cited above. \nTABLE 1 .-Summary of estimated demand for men trained in agriculture \nand forestry to Ph.D. level, 1946-1955. \nSource of demand Number required \nColleges of agriculture and forestry, including state experiment\nstations and state extension services: \n194&--so.........................................

While there are admittedly \nmany uncertain factors which may affect these estimates, it is believed\nthat as a whole they are conservative. \nA total of approximately 2,025 doctor of philosophy degrees were \nconferred for work done in the colleges of agriculture and schools of \nforestry of the United States in the decade from 1936 to 1945. There \nwas a great slump in our training of men for service in agriculture at \nall levels during the war. In most institutions, we shall not have a \n.class of normal pre-war size before the fall of 1946. This means that \nwe shall not have a normal crop of men with a B.S. degree in Agriculture\nbefore the spring of 1950. From three to five additional years \nwill be required for these men to complete their doctorates. Of course, \nmany men returning from the armed forces will resume their training \nbut even so the accumulated deficit is estimated to be about r,4oo \nmen. This deficit is approximately 7o% of the total number of de-\n", 'BRADFIELD: DOMESTIC ASPECTS OF AGRONOMY 307 \ngrees actually granted during the decade r936-45· The total demand \nfor men with Ph.D. training was estimated above at a little over s,ooo \nfor the next ten years. To meet this goal soo men would have to complete\ntheir doctorates each year for the next ten years. This is about \nso% more than we would normally have expected to train. While this \ngoal is probably impossible, it is essential that every effort be made to \ngo as far as practicable toward it. \nThere has been a substantial increase in the public funds available \nfor research in agriculture in the last decade. But for the millions made \navailable for research, tens of millions has been appropriated for so \ncalled "action" programs and hundreds of millions for farm subsidies. \nNo one will question that these new programs have made a useful contribution\nto agriculture. There is a question it seems to me as to \nwhether the present distribution of the funds being spent by the federal\ngovernment to aid agriculture is the distribution that will give \nthe tax payer the greatest returns for his investment. It seems to me \nalso that as agronomists we have a responsibility to the public we \nserve to see to it that any public funds made available for work in the \nagronomic field are directed to the uses that will best serve the longtime\npublic interest. \nCONCLUSIONS \nThere is little evidence to indicate that the century-old trend toward\nincreased industrialization in this country has run its full \ncourse. As the ratio of farm to urban population becomes wider, the \nresponsibilities of the agronomist to our country as a whole become \ngreater. There is less interest in subsistence farming. More efficient \nproduction will be called for. The less efficient producers will have to \nincrease their efficiency or be gradually eliminated. In such a struggle \nthe demand for the services of agronomists of all types will be greatly \nincreased. This increasing demand comes on top of a very great deficit \nin the number of men trained in agriculture as a result of the war. \nSoils must be made more productive and kept so indefinitely. New \ncrops must be developed and old ones improved. Crops must be produced\nmore economically and wastes in their utilization eliminated. \nThe solution of many of these problems cannot be obtained in many \ncases by the isolated, highly specialized research worker. Teamwork \nbetween specialists is called for. This will in tum require shifts in \nmuch of our thinking and changes in our educational programs. \nThere will inevitably be a slow but constant rise in the professional \ntraining of all those concerned with agronomy. Our farmers will be \nmore highly trained. This will call for better training and more specialization\nin our county agents and teachers of vocational agricul-\nture. Available evidence indicates that farmers and the public generally\nare increasingly aware of the necessity for this change. Although \nthe funds made available from public and private sources for agronomic\nresearch, education, and other specialized services have in-\ncreased.greatly in the last decade the demand for expansion continues. \nThe American Society of Agronomy has a great opportunity and a \nnational responsibility to study the needs of the country in its broad \nfreld of interests, to take full advantage of the awakened public interest\nin soil conservation and related fields. Where there is no vision \neven scientific societies perish! \n']</pre>
