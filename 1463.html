The conditions of the roads of\nthe county aro such as to render trav\nel almost impoHsiblo and the commit\ntee In charge felt that It would be\nunwise to hold the exorcises at that\ntime.\nThe dedication of the school was\noriginally set for Washington\'s birth\nday but the carpenters and painters\nwere not ready to turn over the build\ning at that time, It was then decided\nto have the dedication on the date\nnamed and several of the speakers\nhad been secured for the day. It was\nthought at the beginning of the week\nthat the dedication would have to be\ncalled off but It was not announced\nuntil yesterday.\nGovernor A. 0. Stanley of the State\nof Kentucky had been invited to be\npresent nt the dedication exercises\nand although he had not accepted the\ninvitation it was thought h would be\n\' present. Several noted educators In\nthe state were to be present and to de\nliver addresses.\nThe Dandy Dixie Minstrels of this\ncity were to have given their show in\n, the assembly room of the High School\non Saturday night following the dedi\ncation exercises of the day but this\nhas also been called oft and postponed\nto an Indefinite date.\nThe exercises will moBt probably be\nhold together with the commencement\nprogram on May 18. This is tne pian\nat present and certainly there will be\nnothing to hold the exercises back at\nthat time.\nThe pupils of that district will oc\ncupy the building on next Monday\nmorning.\nTEACHERS\' PRAYER MEETING\nThe meeting In the Christian Church\nwill Interest all the members of the\nHible School as well as the teachers\nand officers of that school. The pro\ngram to be followed will begin with a\nperiod of devotion at 7 p. m.

This is an im\nproved road for ten miles of its length,\nbeing of first class water bound maca\ndam, fourteen feet wide sandstone,\nunderlying six Inches of limestone, as\nwearing surface; it Is thoroughly\ndrained with thirteen concrete struc\ntures and pipe culverts. Ten miles of\nthe route is unimproved road, which,\nhowever, has been maintained by the\nuse of sandstone and gravel and is in\nfairly good condition.\nEastern section, extends from\nVanceburg to the Greenup county line\nlength twenty miles. This is im\nproved road for about eleven miles,\ngrading completed. \'Nine miles of\nearth road the remainder of this route,\nis under contract for grading and\ndrainage. The surfacing contract has\nnot been awarded.\n"Tho other routes considered nnd\nunder further consideration, turn off\nat this point on the Kinney pike, up\nIndian creek to Morehead, then to Mt.\nSterling, Winchester and Lexingtoa.\nIf this route is not preferred, begin\nning at the same point, then to Petcrs\nvllle, Foxport, Mt Carmel and Flom\ningsburg, a distance of about twenty-\nfive, miles, and Cowan Station by way\nof Pleasant Valley, Parks Ferry, then\nto Carlisle, Millersburg, Paris and\nLexington."\nThe proposed route is about seven\nteen miles longer, but is said to have\nnumerous scenic advantages along the\nriver not possessed by the other route.\nFer\n11\nGood Housekeeping\ntea lotto\nttladng Kates,\nThe but made\nblades of high\ngrade Heel.\nPiles 35c\neta letter\nHeat\nThcite chopper\nchop without\ncrushing.

Office Public Ledger Building.\nEntered at the Maysvllle, Kentucky, Pustofflce as 8econd-claBg Mall Matter.\nNO DICTATORSHIP DESIRED\nIn his demand for unlimited power iu dealing with foreign af\nfairs,\' President Wilson furnished the strongest argument in favor\nof an extraordinary session of Congress. In his opening sentenee he\ndeclared, that \'we are moving through critical times during which it\nseems to me to be my duty to keep in close touch with the houses of\nCongress, so that neither counsel nor action shall run at cross purposes\nbetween us.\' Later in his address, as an excuse for asking plenary\npower, he said that "it would take an unusual time to assemble and\norganize the Congress which is to succeed\'\' the present.\nSince the constitution vests in Congress alone the power to de\nclare war, and since it is also true that we are passing through criti\ncal times during which it is the President\'s duty to keep in clost\ntouch with Congress, there is every reason why the new Congress\nshould be immediately convened.\nThe demand for plenary power is in direct conflict with the plain\nintent of the constitution, which expressly provides that when ex\ntraordinary occasions arise, the President may convene either or both\nhouses of Congress. Instead of pursuing the policy indicated by the\nconstitution which he is sworn to uphold, President Wilson takes a\nco\'urse whieh the constitution was designed to prevent seeks to sup\nplant Representative government by establishing what would be to\nall intents and purposes a dictatorship.\nUndoubtedly the President seeks this with the highest motives\nUndoubtedly he thinks he could run this government better if there\nwere no legislative or judicial departments but all power were his\nown. As to the sincerity of his demands there can be no question,\nbut the wisdom of his course will be questioned by all those person\nwho still believe in the superiority of the Republican form of flov-\nernment and who have not lost confidence in the men they have\nchosen to represent them in the Senate and House of Representa\ntives.\nEurope is today embroiled iu a war brought on as a result of\ncentralization of power. May America escape that peril !\nTHE REASON\nSome of the cuckoo supporters of the administration arc trying\nto find out what is the matter with the American people that they do\nnot rusli forward to the assistance of the President. They point\nout that Lloyd George always secures the cooperation of Englishmen\nin whatever he undertakes to do, whereas Wilson is always confront\ned with opposition.\nThe answer is simple. Lloyd George knows what he wants to\naccomplish, knows substantially how he will try to accomplish it, and\nhe tells the House of Commons in plain and virgorous language what\nhis purposes are. Mr. Wilson, on the other hand, has never known\nwhat he intends to do in any exact sense, he has had but vague no\ntions of the methods of doing whatever he has meditated, and he\nhas never taken Congress into his confidence in any manner so thai\nthe legislators could frame and act upon a definite measure of sup\nport for him.\nCompare Llyod George\'s latest speech in Parliament with Mr.\nWilson\'s speech to Congress, for instance. Lloyd George told the\nCommons exactly what the British Empire was up against, he point\ned out the remedy, he gave chapter and verse for what he had to say,\nhe summoned British support to the government in trumpet tones.\nMr. Wilson blew both hot. and cold in his speech. He advocated\npacifism, he hinted at war. He told of our duty and qualified it\nwith contingent phrases. He asked for both general and specific\ngrants of power. He left his hearers and the country in doubt re\ngarding what had happened and regarding what he thought might\nhappen.\nWhen Mr. Wilson emulates Lloyd George\'s methods, he will\nsecure a Lloyd George response.\nAnswered\nHypop Expert is Eagerly Sought\nat Leading Drugstore By\nSufferers Seeking\nRelief\nScores of sufferers from Insomnia,\nloss of appetite, chronic weakness,\ntired feeling, restlessness, nervous de\nbility and kindred ailments are hast\nening to avail themselves of the oppor\ntunity to ask health Questions of\nChester Spearing, Hypop Health Ex\npert, who Is making his headquarters\nin Mnysville fur one week at the drug\nstore of J.

PICKETT\nVALIANT CONFEDERATE SOL\n1)1 Fit lli:S AFTEK TWO\nWEEKS\' ILLNESS\nENGLAND AFTER THE WAR\n"Before the war." said Mr. Lloyd George the other day, \'"we\nhad a good many shortcomings in our business, our commerce, oui\nindustry. The war is setting them all right in the most marvel-uis\nway.

Meriwether Smith, Democrat,\nIn the House today when Smith was\nspeaking on his resolution condemn\ning the action of twelve United Stales\nSenators In blocking the passage of\nPresldont Wilson\'s armed neutrality\nbill.\nThe occasion for the demonstration\narose when both Representatives\nHobbs, of Lexington, and Smith, of\nHarrodsburg, presented resolutions\nscoring the Senators for deserting\nPresident Wilson In the hour of the\ncountry\'s need.\nThe first of these resolutions was\nIntroduced by Representative Hobbs\nand Representative Smith then ocred\nhis resolution as a substitute. The\nsubstitute was adopted, Representa\ntive Hobbs thinking It was being offer\ned as an amendment. When he real\nized that the Smith resolution captur\ned all the honors he objected and Rep\nresentative Hutchcraft moved for a\nreconsideration of the voto adopting\nthe substitute which was passed. The\ntwo resolutions were referred to a\ncommittee comprising Representatives\nSmith, Hobbs and Mazyck OTlrion to\ndraft a resolution that would em\nbody the principles set forth in the\ntwo resolutions.\nThe resolution of Representative\nHobbs follows:\n"Whereas, the Kentucky House of\nRepresentatives has heard with\nchargin and deep humiliation of the\nconduct of twelve of the Senators\nof the United States preventing the\nbill authorizing the President of the\nUnited States to defend tho lives and\nproperty of American citizens against\nthe aggression or ruthless destruction\nof any foreign nation, by using the\narmed force of American or other In\nstrumentalities for said purpose, by\nfailing to give consent for said bill to\nbe voted upon and whereas, said con\nduct of said Senators was made pos\nsible by an age-old precedent of the\nUnited States Senate.\n"We, therefore deplore the fart that\nany precedent or rule of the Senate\nshould be held more Bacred than the\nhonor of the American people or the\ndignity of the nation, and feel that the\ntime has come for the abrogation of\nsaid precedent, and the adoption of\nrules consistent with modern ideas\nand with the view of preserving the\nhonor of the people and the dignity of\nthe nation rather than that of the\nUnited States Senate.\n"We condemn in unmeasurable\nterms the action of the eleven Sena\ntors who held their nation up as a\nthing of contempt to the foreign pow\ners of the world and feel that tho pub\nliclie sentiment of this great united\ncountry should drive these disloyal\nand unworthy officers from the high\npositions which they now occupy.\n"We point with eternal and un\nspeakable Indignation to the conduct\nof Senator Stone, of Missouri, and feel\nthat the good people of his State as\nwell as tho people of the entire na\ntion should demand his Immediate\nresignation or removal from the Sen\nate of the United States. We view\nhis conduct as Inexcusable and un\npardonable. "The conduct of Senator La Fol-\nlette, of Wisconsin, is second only to\nthat of Stone and merits the eternal\ncondemnation of every loyal American\ncitizen.\n"We commend the courage and un\nfaltering loyality of Kentucky\'s Sena\ntors in their firm stand behind the\nPresident of the United States to\nmaintain Its honor and uphold its In\ntegrity.\n"This commendation, we give to\nevery loyal Democrat of tho House\nand of the Senate, who courageously\nstood by the President and his coun\ntry in the hour of its peril and more\nespecially do we wish to commend the\naction of those loyal patriotic Repub\nlican Senators like Lodge and Dran\ndegce, who faithfully stood by their\ncountry and showed by their action\nthat they were patriots and states\nmen, ready to yield partisan feeling\nand all other Issues In defense of their\ncountry and those charged with the\nmaintenance of Its honor and Integ\nrity. "Therefore, Be It resolved by the\nHouse of Representatives of the State\nof Kentucky, that a copy of this pre\namble and resolution be sent by the\nclerk of this House to the President\nof the United Stntcs and a copy each\nto Senators James and Beckham for\npresentation to the United States Sen\nute." ,\nWith less than half of her available\nfarming land ultillted, the United\nStates produces one-sixth of the\nworld\'s wheat, tour-ninths of Its eorn,\none-fourth of Its oats, one-eight of Us\neitlle, one-third of It bogs and one\ntwelfth of Hi sheep.\nn\nFAMILY AVOIDS\nSERIOUS SICKNESS\nijr Being Conrlantly Supplied With\nTfcedfonT Cack-DiugnL\nMcUufl, Va.
