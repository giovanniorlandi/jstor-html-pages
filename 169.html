TACT\'S INJUSTICE\nTO HIMSELF\nOn the 22nd of September, 1908,\nMr. Taft, then a candidate, said at\nChicago:\n"The revision of the tariff which\nrepublicans desire is a revision\nwhich shall reduce excessive rates\nand at the same time preserve the\nindustries of the country. I wish\nthere to be no doubt in respect to\nthe revision of the tariff."\nOn the 16th of December, 1908,\nMr. Taft, then president-elect, said\nin New York City:\n"Unless we act in accordance\nwith our promises we shall be made\naccountable to the American people\nand suffer such consequences as\nfailure to keep faith has always\nbeen visited with. It would be\nbetter to have no revision at all un\nless we are going honestly and fair\nly to revise the tariff on the basis\npromised by our party."\nOn the 30th of June, Mr. Taft,\nthen president of the United States,\nsaid in New Haven:\n"Now I venture to say that if\nthe republican party does not live\nup to its promises and what the\npeople expect of it, it will he rele\ngated to ajposition like that of his\nmajesty\'s opposition."\nOn the 5th of August, 1909, when\npreseident Taft signed the Payne\n.Mdrioh bill he said:\n"This law is rot a perfect tariff\nlaw or a complete compliance with\nthe promises made in the republican\nplatform, strictly interpreted."\nOn the 12th of February, 1910,\nxneaking ajrnin m New York, Presi\n\'Ipnt Taft said:\n"Nothing was expressly said in\nthe platform that this revision was\nto be a downward revision. I\ntherefore venture to repeat the re\nmark that I have had occasion to\nmake before, that the present\ncustom law is the best that has ever\nbeen passed."\nThe president is doing his best for\nMessrs.

A Sentinel representative\nlater asked Mr. Van Fleet regarding the matter, and he replied:\n"The reason no mention of the Eureka Live Stock Company is made in\nthe list of assets is that the indebtedness of the Eureka Live Stock Com\npany is included under the head of good notes and overdrafts in setting\nforth the assets of the bank. That be considers the indebtedness of the\nEureka Live Stock Company to the bank good for the reason that the\nbank has attached all the property belonging to the Eureka Live Stock\nCompany, and that if nothing unforeseen comes up the property of the\nEureka Live Stock Company will fully pay the indebtedness of the Eure\nka Live Stock Company to the bank."\nbusiness through and with the Hen\nderson Hanking Company have\nreason to congratulate themselves\nthat they have such a conservative\nhanking institution in their midst,\nin which to entrust their funds.\nIn conversation with John Hen\nderson, president of the Henderson\nBanking Company, this morning,\nwe were informed that it is the\ncustom of the institution to make no\nloans to any of its stockholders,\ndirectors ofc officers and that none\nof the* Above mentioned is indebted\nto the* bank to the value of anything.\nOn the contrary, that they are all\nat the present time depositors.\nThe Henderson Ranking Company\nhas and is making a reputation as\none of the most solid and best man\naged financial institutions on the\ncoast, and we feel justly proud of\nits career.\nThe Victim of Fate.\n,^0Hamn ?

At\nthe session of the court held Satur\nday Bank Examiner Van Fleet stated\nthat he would be prepared at this\ntime to present a statement to the\ncourt showing the true financial\ncondition of the closed bank."\nWith the greater part of the mon\ney Qf this entire community deposit\ned in the suspended bank, the hear\ning of the promised statement was\nawaited with tense feeling and\noverwhelming anxiety. All kinds\nof rumors had been in circulation\nRegarding the actual condition of\nW^Fairs this statement would bring\nforth, and since last Saturday it had\nbeen generally believed that for the\ndepositors, at least, there would be\nlittle loss.\nBut when Bank Examiner Van\nFleet commenced reading a list of\nthe assets he had relegated to the\nscrap pile ? notes and overdrafts of\nthe Smith Brothers\' Investment\nCompany, amounting to $36,438.32;\nnotes and overdrafts of the Smith\nBullfrog Investment Company, a\nmounting to $32,48G.85; notes and\noverdrafts of Minnie D. Smith,\namounting to- $70,124.18; joint\nnotes of O. J., B. L Smith and W.\nE. Griffin, overdrafts of O. J. Smith,\namounting to $80,583.07 ; shares and\ndeposits in the Smith banks at Rhy\nolite and Manhattan ( also recently\n(Hosed), amounting to $20,628.81 ;\nbesides other notes, overdrafts and\ndepreciated securities that brought\nup the total amount of what the\nBank Examiner classes as worthless\npaper to a total loss and shrinkage\nof $282,759.42 ? there was a sup\npressed murmur throughout the\ncourt room, for all realized that\nthese worthless securities meant to\nthem that their good money and\nsavings had been taken from the\nbank and in their place had been\nleft a lot of wildcat mining stock\nand other worthless collateral\n,The complete showing that was\nbrought out by Judge Brcen before\nthe court adjourned has since caused\nthe people of this community to be\ngenerally depressed, as the "rainy\nWlay" money that is now generally\n?ieeded in the camp is tied up and\nnot available for present urgent uses\nand demands. With our mines\nclosed down and our railway out of\ncommission, Eureka seenas to be\nthrice smitten.\nThe tumultuous applause that\ngreeted Judge Breen in his closing\nremarks showed that the sentiment\nof the people was expressed by him,\nand the straightforward manner in\nwhich he brought out facts, figures,\nand present condition of the Eureka\nCounty Bank, and the negligence of\nduty on the part of the officials of\nthe State Banking Board in permit\nting an insolvent bank to continue\nin business for nearly a year after\nits Examiner had reported it insol\nvent, was generally approved by the\nmany depositors of the Eureka\nCounty Bank who were present.\nDISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS\nMonday\'s session of the; District\nCourt will be a memorable one in\nEureka, the profound interest\nthroughout, the number of dramatic\nsituations, and the final sensational\nclosing, marked a most unusual\nj scene in the District Court.\nThe proceedings of this session of\nj the District Court as taken down by\nj R.

Now Mr. Van Fleet I will\nask you to enlighten this Court as\nfar as it is in your power as to the\naffairs and conditions of the Eureka\nCounty Bank, a banking corpora\ntion.\nMr. Van Fleet then read his\nsworn statement of the assets and\nliabilities, as set forth in another\ncolumn.\nBy the Court ?\nI see Mr. Examiner that you refer\nseveral times in your report to the\nSmith Bros. Investment Company\nand to large sums of money having\nbeen loaned to the Smith Bros In\nvestment Company, by the Eureka\nCounty Bank Can you give us\nsome information as to what consti\ntutes the Smith Bros. Investment\nCompany?\n| A I have had an occasion to\nI look up the Smith Brothers Invest\nj ment Company and I learn that it is\ni a corporation formed for the pur\npose of a holding company, to ope\nrate for the Smith interests, that is\nto say, that instead of operating as\nindividuals they formed this corpo\nration so that in the event of the\ndeath of any of the incorporators\nthat it wouldn\'t interfere or retard\nthe handling of the business.\nSo that the Smith Bros. Invest\nment Company owned and con\ntrolled many of the interests held\nby the Smiths.\nQ. Can you state whether or\nnot the Smith Bros.

Investment\nCompany delivered to the Eureka\nCounty Bank numerous and sundry\nmining stock which at the time of\nthe execution of the paper may have\nbeen of value, but at the present\ntime have no market value and are\nconsidered worth less\nQ. You mean to say, Mr. Ex\naminer,. I suppose, that so far a?\nyour knowledge at present goes you\nare not in a position to state whe\nther or not the stock you refer to as\ngiven as security by the Smith Bros.\nInvestment Company for the $31,\n000 was of value at the time it was\ngiven.\nA. I have no knowledge of that\nfor the reason that this all occurred\n0\nprior to my coming into office\nQ. By Mr. Mitchcll:\nAre the Smiths mentioned in the\nInvestment Company spoken of by\nyou the same Smiths who are offi\ncers of the Eureka County Bank, or\nstockholders therein?\nA. I am given so to understand.\nQ. Do you know whether W. E.\nGriffin was a member of the Invest\nment Company spoken of, or a stock\nholder therein?\nA. I do not.\nBy the Court ?\nFor the purpose of enlightening\nthe Court on the qnestion of the ap\npointment of a receiver I would ask\nyou a few questions, Mr Examiner.\nQ. The information you have\ngiven came to you while examining\nthe affairs of the Eureka County\nBank in your official capacity?\nA. Yes, sir\nQ. You were appointed in April\nof 1909 as Bank Examiner of the\nState of Nevada?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. How long to your knowledge\nhas the Eureka County Bank been\ninsolvent and unable to pay its lia\nbilities by its assets?\nA. Since the date of my first ex\namination after my appointment.\nQ. When was that examination\nmade?\nA. During the Summer of 1909.\nQ. Did you, upon making your\nfirst examination and ascertaining\nthe condition of the bank, make to\nthe State Banking Board of the\nState of Nevada your report as pro\nvided by law?\nA. I did.\nQ. You examined the condition\nof the affairs of the Eureka County\nBank, I believe, about the 20th of\nthis last February?\nA. I examined it on the 19th of\nFebruary..\nQ. Was the bank at that time,\nat the time of your last examination\ninsolvent and unable to pay its lia\nbilities by its assets?\nA. I considered it so..\nQ. Did you convey to the State\nBanking Board of Nevada the result\nof your investigations on February\n19 or 20 of this year?\nA. Yes, sir\nQ. By District Attorney Hen\nderson. Do you remember of meet\ning me here at the time of your\nlast examination?\nA. I don\'t remember.\nQ. Do you remember of meet\ning any one .late at night in front\nof the bank, during your last ex\namination?\nA. I do not rememrber of meet\ning any one.\nQ Do you remember of telling\nme at that time, or at any time,\nthat the bank was in good condi\nti on?\nA. 1 do not.\nI By the Court.\nOf course, since the bank closed I\nhave heard things said of its condi\ntion semi-officially hut not under\noath, and now we have the sworn\nstatement of the Bank Kxaminer of\nthe most astounding character.\nIt would seem that the Eureka\nCounty Hank has been practically\ninsolvent, nay, actually insolvent,\nsince some time last Summer and\nthat, no word or hint of its insolv\nency was given by those whose duty\nthe law makes it to do so. Deposi\ntors ? men, women and even child\nren have been induced, I would say\nalmost inveigled into placing their\nmoney and other personal property\nin the keeping of the defunbt bank\nand at the mercy of men who upon\nthe sworn testimony before us would\nseem to be arrant bank looters.\nEvery officer of this corporation\nfrom Oscar J. Smith down to its\ncashiers must have known of the\nbank\'s deplorable financial straits,\nyet not one of them came forward\nto stop the continuance of a public\ncalamity, and that, too, in the face\nof the following provisions of an act\nof the Legislature of this State ap\nproved March 13, 1909.\nHere the Court read the follow\ning provisions of the statutes:\nSection 1. Every officer, direc\ntor, cashier, managing member,\nclerk, person, party or agent of any\nI bank, banking corporation, associa\ntion or firm, bankiny house, bank\ning exchange, brokerage deposit com\n! pany, private bank, and every per\n| son company or corporation,\nj engaged in whole or in part in\n; banking, brokage, exchange or de\n| posit business, in any way, who shall\nj accept or receive on deposit in such\nj bank or banking institution, as afor\nsaid, with or without interest, from\nany person, any money, bank bills\nor notes, checks, bills, bonds, stocks,\ndrafts, or paper circulating as mon\ney, when he knows, or has good rea\nson to know, that such person bank,\nbanking corporation, association or\nfirm, banking house, banking ex\nchange, brokerage deposit company,\nor private bank as aforesaid, is in\nsolvent, and every person knowing\nof such insolvency who shall be\naccessory to, permit, or connive at,\nor assent to, the accepting or re\nceiving on deposit therein or there\nby any such deposit as aforesaid,\nahall be guilty of a felony and pun\nished by imprisonment in the state\nprison for not less than one, nor\nmore than 10 years.\nSection 2, If any officer, direc\ntor, cashier or manager of incorpo\nrated bank, having authority to\nclose any banking institution or to\nprevent the reception of deposits\ntherein, shall not exercise such au\nthority and prevent the deposits\ntherein when he knows such bank is\ninsolvent or in failing circum\nstances, he shall be deemed to have\nassented to the reception of any de\nposits received therein, and the fail\nure, suspension or involuntary li\nquidation of any such bank or\nbanking corporation within 30 days\nfrom and after the time of receiv\ning any deposit therein shall be\nprima facie evidence of knowledge\non the part of such officer, director,\ncashier or manager that such bank\nwas insolvent or in failing circum\nstances at the time such deposit was\nreceived therein; provide, d that if\nany director at any meeting of the\ndirectors of any such corporation\nheld during the ??>0 days next pre\nceding the failure, suspension or in\nvoluntary liquidation, of any such\nbank or banking corporation, shall\nrecord his vote to receive no more\ndeposits therein or to* close such\nbank, he shall not be kerned to\nhave assented to the reception of\nany deposit in such bank, within the\nmeaning of this section.\nThus it would seem that not only\nthe Board of Directors but every\nofficial connected with the bank un\nder the section of the statutes just\nread are amenable to the criminal\nlaws of this State for failing to give\nthe necessary information to the\npublic of the insolvency of the insti\ntution in question, and it would\nseem from the sworn testimnoy giv\nen here today that not only have the\nEureka County Bank\' officials been\nremiss in the performance of their\nduty but that the State Banking\nBoard of Nevada seems to be far\nfrom blameless.\nHere the Court read seotion 44 of\nthe General Banking Act.\nSection 44. Wheneyer it shall\nappear to the State Banking Board,', 'from any examination or report pro\nvided for by this Act, that the capi\ntal of any corporation transacting a\nbanking business under this Act is ?\nimpaired, or that such corporation i\nis conducting its business in an un-j\nsafe or unauthorized manner, or is\nendangering the interests of its de\npositors, or upon the failure of\nsuch corporation to make any of\nthe reports or statements re\nquired by the provisions of this\n-Act or to comply with . the\nprovisions of this Act in all re\nspects, the State Banking Board\nshall communicate the facts to the\nAttorney General, who shall there\nupon cause an application to be\nmade to the District Court of the\ncounty where such corporaiton\nmaintains its bank and is conduct\ning its business, or to any Judge of j\nsaid Court, for the appointment of a j\nsuitable person as a receiver to,\ntake charge of the business, assets\nand property of every kind of said\ncorporation and to wind up its af\nfairs; provided, however, that if\nthe Judge or Judges of the District\nCourt of the county where such ap\nplication should be made be absent\ntherefrom at the time such applica\ntion is to be made, any Judge of\nthe Supreme Court may appoint\nsuch receiver, but all proceedings\nin relation to such receivership\nthereafter shall be had before the\nDistrict Court, or a Judge therof, j\nwhich might have appointed such j\nreceiver in the first instance, and i\nthe petition and the order appoint- ;\nng such receiver shall be forthwith j\ntransmitted to the Clerk of such j\nDistrit Court. It shall be sufficient ]\nto authorize the appointment of a!\nreceiver if any of the facts herein j\nenumerated as a ground for the ap- j\nplication for a receiver be made to ]\nappear. Nothing in this Act shall\naffect any proceeding now pending\nin settling up the \'affairs of any\nbank now in custody of the present\nBank Commissioners or the Bank\nExaminer, or any receivership now\npending, hut all such settlements\nand proceedings shall be continued\nand completed in accordance with\nthe present law, and all rights that\nmay have accrued under and by vir-j\ntue of any law now existing are\n\'hereby preserved.\nNow, then, how is it that with\nthe report of the bank examiner be\nfore them the members of the State\nBoard failed for so long a time in\ntheir duty and thus facilitated the\nplundeing of the public by this so\ncalled bank. The penal provisions\nof the law I have just read were\nevidently intended by the Legislat\nure to protect the public, depositors\nand business men, not from the bank\nmanagement of. honorable men, but\nfrom the rapacity of men who have\nthree of the qualifications for sue- i\ncessful road agents, to one for con-,\nservative banking.\nI consider the appointment of a\nreceiver under these circumstances\na matter of vihtal importance to\nthe people of this community, and\nwhilst I believe that the utmost\nspeed consistent with safety should j\nbe exercised by the Court in the ap\npointment of a Receiver, I deem it\nmy duty under the sworn testimony\npresented to me today to take a\nfew days at least to think over and\ndetermine who in my mind would\nbe the proper person to take charge\nof\' the assets of this bank in the in\nterest of the depositors and all con\ncerned. When I am ready to ap\npoint a receiver I shall give notice\nof it, so that all who are interested\nmay be present in Court, if they de\nsire to be present.\nAs the county is deeply interested\nI should like very much to have at\nleast a majority of the County Com\nmissioners in this town before I de\ntermine who shall be receiver.\nI understand that Commissioner\nFraser will be here in a few days,\nand upon his arrival I shall certain\nly suggest the appointment of addi\ntional counsel to assist the District\nAttorney in an examination into the\nsituation that now confronts us, and\nI say again that it will only be a\nfew days before I appoint a receiver.\nHere the Deputy Attorney Gene\nral arose and addressed the Court\nin regard to the State Board and\nothers for not closing the doors of\nthe bank, or otherwise notifying the\npublic of its insolvency, and spoke\nsubstantially as follows:\nDEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S STATE\nMENT\n"It may be meet for me to make\na statement at this time. I do not\nwish to condone or mitigate any\nwrong. One thing is certain, and\nthat is that at every turn of the\nroadway Mr. Van Fleet has per\nformed his duty, but it may appear\nthat the State Banking Board de\nlayed too long before taking action,\nbut in waiting and negotiating it\nexpected to accomplish benefits to\nthe depositors. If the members of\nthis Board worshipped the goddess\nof Hope, it was in the firm belief\nthat something valuable would be\nobtained that would prevent sorrow\nand ruin to the people of Eureka\nand financial distress to the people\nof Nevada,\n"Mr. Gorman at all times was\nwilling to co-operate with the State\nBanking Board in its efforts to pre\nvent loss to the depositors, and\nduring the month of negotiating\nit was the hope that the bank would\nbe placed on a sound financial basis\nand the depositors saved from any\nloss."\nMr. Fowler in an interview given\nto a representative of this paper\nsaid:\n"The all important thing at the\npresent time is the protection of the\ninterests of the depositors. It is\neasy to look back and see what\nmight have been done, but it is al\nways difficult for finite minds to\npenetrate the future. The neces\nsary action at this time is to con\nserve the assets of this bank, and to\ndo this conservative handling of the\nsituation is required. The ap\npointment of a receiver rests en\ntirely with the court and it is a\nsacred and serious responsibility. I\nhope that the best man possible will\nbe selected, but as to whom should\nbe appointed I have no suggestions\nto make. No matter what person j\nmay be chosen he will need the\nfriendsihp of Mr. Gorman and Mr. i\nClarke, or otherwise the assets will\ndwindle from lack of knowledge of\nthem. Without the assistance of\nthese men thousands of dollars will\nbe lost to the depositors.\n"One thing is certain, and that is\nthat in winding up the affairs of the\nbank, if the depositors are to re\nceive proper protection, conser\nvatism and not radicalism is re\nquired."\nJUDGE BREEN TO ATTORNEY GENERAL\nUpon the Deputy Attorney General\nhaving gotten well into the course\npursued by the officers, or some of\nthem, of the bank, as well as the\ncourse and action of the State Bank\ning Board, Judge Breen interrupted\nhim and said substantially:\n"Mr. Attorney General, you are\ntestifying to facts which have noth\ning to do with this hearing and,\nworse still, you are testifying with\nout being under oath. The state\nexaminer has testified here that the\ninsolvency of the Eureka County\nBank was known to him since last\nsummer, and that he reported its\ninsolvency to the State Board ; that,\nagain, upon his examination into the\ncondition of the bank on the 19th or\n20th of last month, and finding it\nstill insolvent, he again reported the\nresult of his investigation to the\nState Board. Yet, during all of\nthis time, no action was taken by\nthe board any more than by the\nbank or its officers, from preseident\nto cashier, to notify depositors and\nothers doing business with this de\nfunct institution, to warn them of\nits deplorable financial condition\nand save the people from depositing\ntheir money where it was sure to be\nlost ? to save them from being\nfurther plundered ? if the testimony\ngiven here today by the Bank Ex\naminer be true, and I believe it is.\nThat the law has been violated\nduring all that time, since last Sum\nmer, there can be no question if the\nBank\' Examiner has stated the truth,\nand it ill becomes you, as Assist\nant Attorney General of Nevada, to\nstand up here as an apologist for its\nviolation ? you whose duty it is to\nuphold the law, and whose duty it\nmay yet become to take action in a\ndifferent direction.\nIf the statements of the Bank\nExaminer be untrue, those who now\nstand accused by such sworn state\nments of neglect of duty were\nguilty of no such neglect, ample\nopportunity will be given by this\nCourt for their exculpation.\nIt is but poor consoltion to those\nwho have lost their money ? yes, in\nsome instances, money deposited\nbut two days before the bank\nclosed, to say to those whose duty\nit was to give them warning had\nfailed to do so ? but with the best\nintentions.\nHere Court adjourned until Tues\nday at 10 a. m.\nTHE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER\nOn Tuesday, March 29, Judge Breen called a meeting of depositors to\nassist by suggestion in the matter of the appointment of a suitable per\nson for Receiver of the Eureka County Bank. Some $60,000 or $80,000\nof deposits were represented at the meeting. Judge Breen. explained\nthe difficulties before him in consequence of our limited population and\nthe few who could be found locally who are familiar with banking.\nJudge Breen also set forth that under the sworn statement of the Bank\nExaminer, the few who were available might be ineligible because of\ntheir neglect to make known the insolvency of the bank, though having\nfull knowledge of such insolvency for months and months; that to ap\npoint a man who had such knowledge, and neglected what would seem to\nbe his duty, for so long a time, and thus lead to loss by depositors, big\nand little, of large sums of money, would be by him and his Court an en\ndorsement of illegal methods, an edorsement of a violation of the law,\nand. that he would resign his office before such a charge could be laid at\nthe door of his Court\nJudge Breen\'s position was unanimously approved, and it was agreed\nthat he should wire the Scheeline Banking and Trust Company, of Reno,\nNevada, as to whether it would accept the appointment or not.\nDON\'T WANT RECEIVERSHIP\nThe Receivership was offered to\nMr. Scheeline and he started for\nEureka to look over the situation.\nHe came to Elko last Thursday and\nbeing unable to reach Eureka from\nhere, he wired Judge Breen that he\ncould not accept the appointment\nand returned to Reno.\nUpon ascertaining that the Schee\nline Banking and Trust Company\ndeclined the appointment, another\nmeeting of depositors was at once\ncalled in chambers on Friday, April\n1. The large room was crowded,\nand in the of neighborhood $100,000\nwas represented.\nThe situation having been ex\nplained to the depositors, a motion\nwas unanimously adopted that\nJudge Breen communicate with\nHenderson Banking Company of\nElko on the all important subject.\nThe question came up as to\nwhether the Court could legally\nappoint an official of the insolvent\ncorporation as receiver, The Judge\nsaid it was very doubtful, and quot\ned authorities, which held that a\nperson interested in the trust, or\none who had been engaged in tran\nsactions either unlawful or in breach\nof trust ,was disqualified to hold a\nReceivership, and said:\n"That if the Bank Pixaminer\'s\nsworn statement be true, which of\nthe officers of the Eureka County\nBank is it who has not been en\ngaged in unlawful transactions ?\nsay, in receiving the money of de\npositors for months, when it was\nknown the bank was insolvent and\ncould not reimburse depositors?\nAnd which of the officers is it that\ndoes come within the aforegoing\ninhibitions?\nOur statutes provide that the\nCourt shall appoint a suitable per\nson receiver, and the sound discre\ntion of the Court should be called\ninto play in determining who is a\nsuitable person".\nJudge Breen wired the offer of\nthe Receivership to the Henderson\nBanking Company last Friday and,\nafter considering the matter thor\noughly, John Henderson, president\nof the hank, declined the appoint\nment and wired Judge Breen^Sun\nday afternoon to that effect.\nADDITIONAL STATEMENT OF\nDEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL\nIn an interview with a represent- 1\nativo of this paper on Thursday,\nDeputy Attorney General Fowler j\nsaid: I\n"Time will vindicate the position\nof the State Banking Board, and\nthis will be when the depositors be\ncome enlightened of the fact that |\nthe bank is in much betterjeondi- j\ntion today than it was when its em\nbarrasment first became known.\n"The depositors will receive a ;\nlarger percentage on the dollarjthan !\nthey would have received had the!\nbank been closed a few months ago. i\n"The Banking Board has consid\nered first the interest of the deposi\ntors, and it has not permitted tech\nnicalities to work to thejnjury of\nthose persons who are the most con- (\ncerned. In this attitude of protec\ntion to depositors the members of\nthe Banking Board shouldjreceive\nthe thanks and gratitude of the\npeople.\n,JThe laws of this State must be\nupheld, and the Grand Jury which i\nhas .been called willjdoubtless\'make ;\na searching J investigation, J, fand |in\nthis the Attorney General\'s office\nwill render assistance in the hope\nthat justice will triumph."\nATTACHMENT LEVIED\nSuit was commenced in the Dis\ntrict Court in Eureka on MarcK^\nat the instance of the State Banking\nBoard by the Eureka County Bank\nagainst the Eureka Live Stock Com\npany of South Dakota to recover\nthe sum of $28,733.33. The nature\nof plaintiff\'s claim is as follows:\nUpon three promissory notes ex\necuted and delivered by defendant\nto one Minnie D.

SMITH INTERVIEWED\nSaturday\'s Reno Gazette con\ntains the following interview with\nOscar J. Smith, regarding the\nfailure of the Eureka County Bank.\nThe Gazettesays that Mr. Smith has\naged perceptibly since the crash\ncame and has assumed a more\nserious aspect than his wont, but is\nphilosophic through it all:\n"My brother, my wife and I were\nin apparently prosperous circum\nstances before the crash came, but\nwe played out our hands to the last\ncard, or, as a billiard de votee would\nsay, to the end of the string.\nWe did not really know that the\ncrash would come until the night\nbefore the suspension . of the\nRhyolite institution. It would have\nbeen better for our depositors and\nfor ourselves if we had wound up\nour banking business months ago,\nbut we had investments that were\nliable to prove of great value at any\nmoment.\nThat, is all there is to the story\nand we have nil three placed what\nfortune we posses hack of the insti\ntutions. Mrs. Smith will powes\nabsolutely nothing more than the\nequity in her house and I will have\nmy law library, the tool of my\ntrade; Bert will emerge equally\nstripped of his possesions.\nI am confident that the Rhyolite\nbank will pay every cent of its in\ndebtedness and am assured that the\nEureka institution will do equallv\nas well. My brother and I will I\nonly surrender all our present as\nsets, but we will labor for the bal\nance of our days to the end that no\nman can say we ever took advantage\n(Continued on page 5.) ? ^', 'Jl SALMAGUNDI |\nj=j#y?rintendent Anderson and Mr.\n[Bon Ham left for Lamoille this morn\ning.\nThe Elko Drug Company has the\nsweetest candies in the market.

Mr. Henderson\ncomplied with the request hthI Mr.\nBoyce left for Eureka in the after\nnoon with his automobile. No\nparticulars were given in the dis\npatch and all sorts of conjectures\nwere floating around. In order to\nget the correct particulars, we\nwired the Sentinel this morning and\nreceived the following reply:\nHank Examiner Van Fleet was\ntaken ill suddenly Saturday night,\nwhile in his rooms at the hotel\nZadow, with severe pains across the\nchest, accompanied by retching,\nvomiting and dizziness. Dr. Bur\nnett attended him with treatment\nwhich gave relief, and in about an\nhour he was able to talk with the\ndoctor regarding his condition. He\nsaid then that he felt much better\nbut asked the doctor to remaln\'with\nhim. Mr. Van Fleet told the doctor\nthat he had had two similar attacks\nbut neither of them as severe as\nthis last one. Dr. Burnett and\nfriends then stepped out into the\nhall to allow the patient to rest.\nAt a disturbance in Mr. Van Fleet\'s\nroom they returned to him to find\nhim passing from another spasm\nsucceeding which Mr. Van Fleet\ndied immediately, at about 11.45\no\'clock, p. m. Doctor Burnett\nstated that death was due to an at\ntack of neuralgia of the heart. On\nSunday a coroner\'s jury pronounced\nthe death tohave been due to natural\ncauses. The remains left for Elko\nat nine o\'clock this morning in an\nautomobile, accompanied by Deputy\nAttorney General Fowler.\nGovernor Dickerson wired in\nstructions to Eureka placing cashier\nGorman in custody of the Eureka\nCounty Bank, saying that he would\nbe in Eureka or wire further di\nrections today. The commissioners\nhad the sheriff take possession of\nthe bank on Sunday and he remains\nstill in charge. No receiver has\nbeen appointed.\nJUST A PLAIN STATEMENT OF FACTS\nUnder the heading of "Who\'s Ox\nis Gored," the Free Press of Satur\nday undertakes to justify Recorder\nGreathouse\'s appointment of L. S.\nEiler as deputy recorder. In doing\nso, it insinuates that the writer of\nthis article was appointed deputy\nassessor by Mr. Hesson immediately\nupon his arrival in this county.\nHow base and cowardly the insin\nuation is will be seen from the fol\nlowing statement:\nOn St. Valentine\'s Day, 1875, we\narrived in Virginia City, Nevada,\nand made it our home until the lat\nter part of August or the first of\nSeptember, 188(>, when we arrived\nin Elko to takirTharge of the public\nschool as principal. At the close of\nthat school year we were unanim\nously re-elected as principal. In\nJune or July of" 1887, Mr. Hesson\nappointed us his office deputy.\nFrom this it will be seen that we\nhad been a citizen of Nevada for\nover twelve years and a citizen of\nElko county nearly a year before\nbeing appointed a deputy assessor.\nQuite a difference between the facts\nand the false and cowardly insin\nuation of the Free Press.\nSo. far as Aubrey Henderson\'s\nresidence in the county, before his\nappointment as deputy recorder, is\nconcerned, he informs us that he\ncame to Nevada five years ago and\nto this county in February, 1909,\nand for a time held a position in the\nHenderson Hank; and at the time of\nhis appointment, in August or Sep\ntember of last year, was working\nfor the Western Pacific Railroad\nCompany. Quite a difference be\ntween five years in Nevada and the\nfew days Mr. Eiler has been here.\nThe editor of this paper has never\nattempted to influence or dictate to\nRecorder Greathouse in any way and\nany insinuaton or statement to the\ncontrary by Mr. Greathouse or any\none else is only the imagination of\na diseased brain or the baseless\nstatement of a cowardly liar.\n?\nMarches and Marches.\nA school teacher In a Jersey town\nsaw somo of George fillet\'s works dis\nplayed In the window of the "gen\neral store" and went In to Inquire If\nthey hnd "Middlemarch."\n"No, we haven\'t that," said the red\ncheeked girl who served as clerk, "but\nwo have some of the new ones.

We worked in the face of\ninnumerable obstacles, the first\nbeing the San Francisco fire, which\ncaused a shrinkage in our securities\namounting to a half million dollars, 1\nThe fall in the price of ourGoldfield\nholdings, due to the labor troubles\nthere, caught us for a couple of\nhundred thousand dollars more and\nthe great pani c completed the dis\naster. Since that we have struggled\nto get our heads above water and I\nthink we should have succeeded in\ntime. But the crash has come now\nand all we will do the rest of our\ndays, if it requires our remaining\nyears, will be to make everybody\nsquare, and this will, we hope,\nrequire only & few months. Then,\nand only then, we ,\\v i 1 1 endeavor to\nrepair our individual fortunes.\nI want to say this, that I am in\nclose touch with the banking insti\ntutions throughout the state and all\nof them are in most prosperous con\ndition, especially those of Reno,\nwhich are as strong as the rock of\nGibraltar. The First National Bank\nof Klko, with which my brother and\nmyself were once prominently con\nnected, is as solvent as any other\nbanking institution in Nevada. The j\nBank of Manhattan, which we con\ntrolled has been liquidated without\na loss to a singln individual. Near\nly all accounts have been paid and\nthere is more than enough gold coin\nin the vaults to pay everything that\nremains and then some."\nCARD OF THANKS\nWe hereby extend our sincere\nthanks to all who so kindly assisted\nus on the sad occasion of the death\nand burial of our mother.\nFrank Blundell\nGeorge E.
