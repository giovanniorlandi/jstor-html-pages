In\nasmuch as Col. C. C. Slaughter, ol\nDallas, and who Is now in Roswell,\nhad certain claims against this road,\nthe purchaser gave Col. Slaughter a\nguarantee bond that he will commence\nconstruction within sixty days.\nThis road was projected about twen\nty years ago and about 87 miles of\ngrading was done, -beginning at a\npoint six miles from Dallas and run\nning nortwest to Jacksboro, in Jack\ncounty. This grade is in fine shape\nat the present time and is covered with\nbermuda grass. Of course in some\nfew places where streams cross it it\nhas been cut out by the water, but\notherwise is as good, if not better\nthan the days in which it was done.\nThe road was originally planned to\ncross\' the Pecos river at a point about\nhalf way between Roswell and Ft.\nSumner. It is extremely probable,\nhowever, that owing to the construc\ntion of the Belen cut-off line, the new\nowners of the road will desire to run\nthe line further south and there is\nwhere Roswell comes In.\nSuch a line, running as it would in\na straight line from Roswell directly\nto Dallas, a distance of about 420\nmiles, would be of the utmost import\nance to Roswell and would propably\n\'be better situated to open up mark\nets for the farmers of the Pecos Val\nley than any other line that could be\nconstructed.\nThe Record believes it would be\nwell for the people of Roswell to get\nInto correspondence with Air. MoGar\ngle and see what steps will -be neces\nsary to have this line strike through\nRoswell.\nARMY MANEUVERS AT\nFORT RILEY, KANSAS.\n. Fort .Riley, Kan., Sept. 2.

This rate applies\nto points in Chaves and Eddy coun\nties and is good on the 5th and 6th.\nEXTENSIVE PREPARATIONS\nFOR LABOR DAY.\nThe Labor Day celebration Monday\npromises to be one of the best ever\nheld in Roswell. The committee hav\ning the work in charge today receiv\ned notice that a railroad rate of one\nand a third fare for the round trip\nwould be granted to Roswell from all\ntowns between Carlsbad and Clovis,\nincluding both of these towns.. Three\nbands of music will be on hand for\nthe parade. A big barbecue will form\na part of the celebration, and every\nbody is invited. There will be some\nspeeches and lots of music and good\ncheer. The full progTam will be out\ntomorrow.\nCome to the weighing social at the\nM. E. Church, South, Thursday even\ning at 8 o\'clock.\nVisitors were greatly\ninterested in railroad.\nThe smoker at the Roswell Commer\ncial Club last night was not largely\nattended, although there was a fair\nrepresentation of business men. The\nbad weather and brevity of the notice\ncut down the attendance.\nThe smoke was held in honor of\nCol. C. C. Slaughter, of Dallas, S. S.\nLees, of Newark, N. J., and W. A. Cul\nlum, of Hereford, Tex., who are the\nleading spirits in the building of a\nroad from the Rock Island railroad\nin the Panhandle, through Hereford\nand south to Fort Worth. They are\nall deeply interested in Roswell\'s\nnew prospective road, and at last\nnight\'s smoker each spoke on the\nsubject. They promised to build a\nroad into Roswell if the present plan\nshould for any reason fail. President\nRobt. Kellahin, W. A. Johnson and\nGeorge M. Slaughter were the local\nspeakers.\nThe most important event of the\nmeeting was the completion of ar\nrangements with Col. Slaughter for a\nright-of-way through his land for the\nAltus, Roswell & El Paso railroad.\no\nCome to the weighing social at the\nM. E.

JCvery man on the county ticket Is\ncertain to be elected by large majori\nties, hut nevertheless it is just as\nwell to get busy and roll up a good\nvote Just to show the republicans that\nwe hare them.\nThe majority that Mr. Larrazolo is\ncertain to receive this fall in the eas\ntern half of New Mexico will make\nthe- old-time gangsters set up and ad\nmit that in the future the eastern sec\ntion of the Territory will have some\nthlnr to sar about affairs in New\nMexico in the future.\nThe republicans have had opportun\nitv again and again for . year after\nyear to give New Mexico statehood,\nbat just as regularly they have voted\nit down. Now they\' have the nerve\nto ask the people of New Mexico to\ngive them -another chance, and then\nthe next time they would come along\nwith - the- same old plea.\nOf coune we must acknowledge\nthat Delegate Andrews has some In\nftuence at Washington. He succeeded\nia preventing a report on the Larra-\nKew Mexico, is to wait until after the\nsolo contest until after the term\nf. office In controversy should expire\nevad. another election take place. But\nit is men of such influence as this\nthat, have- deprived New Mexico of\nstatehood for - years. If Andrews bad\naoaeetly believed himself elected he\n\' wouldr-fcave insisted on a prompt and\nfull bearing of the contest.\nKIFLWG\'S CANDIES\nARB\nftro,7I::!:sc:r.3 and Good\n: J5pm ting new\naehday\n! :;; , OUR !\nD crp a o::rnri:Jcs\nIN POLITICS.\n-Business Manager\nEditor\nThe only way to get home rule In\nelections this fall, and with Mr. Bry\nan at Washington, Larrazolo there as\ndelegate, New Mexico will be given\nthe right to elect its own officers and\ntake care of Its own internal affairs\nThere is no other way. All this talk\nin republican papers of Andrews se\ncuring statehood is all nonsense and\nthe people of New Mexico know it\n5Tr. Andrews has had two terms, and\nthe republicans could have given us\nstatehood at any time, had they hon\nestly desired to do so, but they did\nnot, fearing the territory would send\nDemocrats to represent it in the na\ntional legislative halls. The only hope\nof statehood for New Mexico is in a\nDemocratic victory this fall.\nRepublican newspapers are busily\ncirculating the glad tidings in New\nMexico that we are about to receive\n$25,464.12 for the benefit of the\nschool and roads in the Territory\nfrom the United States. This informa\ntlon is printed in the form of a let\nter to Delegate W. H. Andrews, the\nman who "does things," and is circu\nlated to show how active the dele\ngate has been in looking after the\ninterests of the Territory. This\n$25,464.14 is twenty-five per cent of\nthe $101,856.49 collected from the peo\npie of New Mexico for the privilege\nof grazing stock on the forest re\nserves and for wood and timber so\nthat it will be seen that the govern\nment collects $101,856.49 and returns\n$25,464.12 or a return of $1 for $4\nAnybody would be willing to do such\na business as that. It must be remem\nbered that under a Democratic admin\nistration, there was no charge for\ngrazing on the public lands. The dif\nference to the stockmen of New Mex\nico between a Democratic and a Re\npublican administration is $101,556.49\nin a year, $8,488.04 in a month, or\nnearly $300 a day. This is a consid\nerable item . to be going out of the\nTerritory, and the Republican party\nIs responsible for it. Santa Fe\nEagle.\nPROMISES.\nPromises are easy. Sometimes per\nformances do not correspond with\npromises which have been made, and\nsometimes the actions of the party\nor person making a promise are not\nquite in line with the promise.\nRepublicans have been promising\nstatehood for New Mexico for many\nyears. The Republicans have had it\nin their power to give New Mexico\nstatehood and they have not done so.\nIs there any more reason to expect\nstatehood at the hands of the Repub\nlican party this year than there was\nlast year? Of course there is not. No\nsane person will believe the promise\nof the Republican party, contained\nIn its platform which was adopted\nin Chicago last June.\nHad the Republicans in congress\nhad an honest desire to pass a state\nhood bill for New -Mexico, they would\nhave passed it at the long session of\ncongress, when they had plenty of\ntime, and would have provided for\nthe admission of the territory at\nsome date after the third of Novem\nber if, as was stated, they desired to\nkeep New Mexico out until after the\npresidential campaign, instead of\nwaiting for the short session of con\ngress when little legislation beyond\ntne necessary appropriation bills Is\nusually undertaken. The excuse is\nentirely too gauzy to deceive.\nThe action of our delegate to con\ngress does not appear to show that\nhe has much confidence in the pass\nage of a statehood bill at the coming\nsession of congress, although he\ntalks differently. In his three-minute\nspeech after his re-nomination here\nlast week he said:\nI am convinced that I will not be\ncalled upon, even though elected in\nNovember, to take any seat in con\ngress In December, 1909, for by that\ntime the Republican party will have\nredeemed its pledge for the immed\niate admission of -New Mexico to\nstatehood."\nIf Mr. Andrews Is so certain that\nthe hill for the admission of New\nMexico will be passed before Decem\nber, 1909, we . wonder why he is so\nanxious to be elected? - We wonder\nwhy he spent so much time and mon\ney to secure the nomination for an\noffice - which he does not expect to\nfill? Did you ever see a man breaking\nhis neck to catch a street car when\nthere was no street car to be caught T\nif Mr. Andrews really believed that\nthere would be a statehood bill pass-\'\ned at the short session of congress\nit is highly improbable that he would\nspend forty thousand dollars in a des\nperate attempt to he elected to a po\nsition which would not exist. The\nman making a wild rush for an im\naginary street car would be sensible\nIn comparison with the man who\nwould make a brass band and special\ntrain \'campaign to be elected to an\nimaginary office. We do not believe\nthat Mr. Andrews is as big a fool as\nhis friends are trying to make him\nout to he. It looks to us as though\nTar. Andrew is firmly convinced that\nthere will be no statehood hill passed\nat the coming session of congress\nand that, if elected, he will draw his\npay as delegate to congress from New\nMexico. The actions of Mr. Andrews\nare not in line with his words. The\ntruth of the matter is that the Repub\nlicans have placed themselves in a\nridiculous position in the statehood\nmatter, and now they are squirming\nlike eels in an ash barrel. \'Santa Fe\nEagle.\nEDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN\nROOSEVELT COUNTY.\nSpecial Correspondence.\nPortales, N.

This institute is be\nyond question the largest ever held\nin New Mexico, the total enrollment\na\nUllery Furniture Co.\nUndertakers\nAmbulance Service.\nbeing one hundred and forty nine,\nagainst seventy-seven of last year,\nWhile our teaching force has greatly\nincreased, superior to any other year\nsince the organization of the county,\nand the coining school year will be one\nof the most beneficial to the pupils\nof our county of any section of the\nSouthwest.\nRoosevelt county\'s educational\nwork is no longer the crude experi\nment of pioneer days, but the strong.\nvigorous and intelligent work of ex\nperienced teachers acquainted with\nthe conditions and capable of creat\ning and maintaining an educational\nstandard equal to that of any in what\never state you wish to choose as a\nstandard. Mr. Brasher, the conductor,\nhas organized the institute along prac\ntical lines, and the consensus of opin\nion among the teachers is that the\nwork accomplished and the benefits\nderived from the work excels that of\nany other institute they have ever\nattended, while the method pursued\nIn the mainenance of discipline is\nreasonable, fair and applied impar\ntially, and all feel that the institute\nis being conducted with the one Idea\nof making it of the most benefit to\neach and all, in preparing for exam\nination and in better fitting them for\ntheir work during the coming year.\nNone of the teachers will write for\na third grade; all will write for a\nfirst or second grade certificate, and\nfully one-third will write for a first\ngrade. A number of our teachers hold\nlife and Normal certificates from oth\ner states and are entitled under the\nlaws of New Mexico to a five year\ncertificate. The number of five year\ncertificates held in Roosevelt county\nexceeds that of any other county in\nthe Territory, and we firmly believe\nthat our county will increase Its lead\nwith each passing year. This county\nis forging to the front and its lead\nin educational matters is but a fair\nindex of what is being done along\nother lines.\nMr. J. A. Fairley,. county superin\ntendent of schools, has conscientious\nly worked for the betterment of the\nschool conditions in the county, and\nhas succeeded in placing our schools\nneaTeT to what all who are interested\nIn school work are striving for, a\nschool system that will accomplish\nthe best results under conditions as\nthey are now and will exist. The suc\ncess of our Institute is an evidence\nof Mr. Fairlys interest in the work\nand of his efforts to place his comity\nin the forefront educationally. Mrs.\nS. P. Culberson, our next county sup\nerintendent, has been In attendance\nduring most of the time. Mrs. Culber\nson has - always taken great Interest\nin educational matters and the teadh-\nera are to he congratulated on having\nfor their next county superintendent\none as experienced in school work.\nProf. M. Z, Spahr will be superin\ntendent of schools at Portales, and\nProf. W. G. Russell principal; Prof.\nJ. F. Taylor, superintendent at Clovis;\nProf. A. W. Glasgow, principal at Eli\nda; Prof. W. R. Morgan, principal at\nTexico; Prof. A. L. Lacy, principal at\nMelrose, and A- E. Cross, principal\nat Taiban.\n\'The old school building In Portales\nwas sold for $500, and work will be\npushed on the new High School build\ning, and it is expected ;- that it will\nbe completed in time to begin school\nby the first Monday in October.\nThe teachers have organized a\nChild Study Club for the purpose of\nstudying child nature and improve\nment In method of instruction.\nThere is considerable sentiment\namong the teachers In favor of hold\ning the Institute at Clovis next year,\nbelieving that a change will be of\nbenefit to them in extending their ac\nquaintance, and in giving them a. bet\nter knowledge of the county and edu\ncational conditions.\nThere has not been to exceed ten\ncases of tardiness during the first\nweek of the Institute. Considering the\nnumber in attendance, we invite com\nparison with all . Institutes of New\nMexico and Texas, and ..others if they\ncan show a better record. We believe\nthat, Roosevelt teachers have set the\npace. Mr. John .. F. Taylor of Clovis\nwas elected President of the Roose\nvelt County Teachers\' Association for\n1908-9. Mr. Taylor is an up-to-date ed\nucator of pleasing personality and\npractical In his views and methods\nand In electing him, the teachers have\ntaken a long . step towards insuring\nand Embalmers\nTelephone No. 75\nthe success of our Association meet\nings during the coming year. The\nteachers met Monday, August 24th,\nat the M. E. Church to organize a\nTeachers\' Anti- Saloon League. The\nmeeting was opened -by Mrs. S. L.\nCulberson by a short prayer, after\nwhich Prof. E. L- Brewer, of Texico,\nW. R. Morgan, of Texico, J. F. Tay\nlor, of Clovis, Cha\'s. Scott and Judge\nLindsey gave short addresses.\nThe officers of the Teachers\' Asso\nciation for the coming year are J. F.\nTaylor, President; A. W. Glasgow,\nVice-President; Miss Edith Sanders,\nSecretary and Treasurer.\nJ. E. Clark, Territorial Superinten\ndent, spent Wednesday visiting the\nInstitute. He was agreeably surpris\ned at the high professional standard\nof the Roosevelt county teachers. He\nwas surprised with the enthusiasm\nthe hard work-, the harmonious and\ngood fellowship feeling prevailing\namong this large and intelligent body\nof teachers.\nMany of the Roosevelt county\nteachers will attend the Pecos Valley\nTeachers Association to be held at\nRoswell Friday and Saturday follow\ning Thanksgiving. They will unite\ntheir efforts with that of the teachers\nof Chaves and Eddy counties in se\ncuring the next Territorial Teachers\'\nAssociation for Roswell a year from\nthe coming December.\nConductor Brasher and his Instruct\nors appreciate very much the compli\nment paid them by the teachers of\nRoosevelt by their unanimous action\nin asking them to conduct the insti\ntute again next year. It is not often\nthat a compliment of this kind is paid\nto an Institute : conductor and his\ncorps of instructors. J. F.
