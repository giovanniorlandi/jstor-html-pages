Governor Ferguson in\nhis appeal declared the situation was\nperilous and grave and was doubtful\nof the ability of the State forces and\nlocal officers to longer control the sit\nnation.\nCitizens of Itrownsvillc and other\nborder cities did not agree that the\ntroubles were due to political feuds in\nthis section. Considerable evidence\nseemed to be brought forward that the\nraiders were organized into several\nbands working under the plan of San\nDiego, a movement started a year ago\nat San Diego, Texas, where resolu\nlions were passed declaring for wrest\ning front the United States a strip of\nterritory along the border to be added\nto Mexico.\nWhile the situation was expected to\nbe part\'y relieved with the arrival in\nthis section of the third battalion,\nN:nth infantry, sent from Laredo yes\nterday, expressions of officials gen\nerally were that it would require more\nsoldiers to suppress the movement.\nThe zone of tiie operation-, of the\nraiders was widened to a large extent\nin the last 24 ! ours, although a few\nadditional reports of the depredations\nreached here. The late t meeting of\nthe raiders with troops was reported\nftom Katherine, 80 miles north of\nBrownsville, where a ban dof 30 or\nmore Mexicans attempeted a daring\nraid on the one store of the town.\nThey were frustrated in the attempt\nby a dozen United States soldiers sta\ntioned in the store, who fired on the\nbandits, injuring two, it was believed.\nN\'o reports came of further killing\nsince those of Monday, when 10 per\nsons were shot and killed.\nConfirmation is lacking of reports\nI Recess August 10, 9 a. in.\nWill McDonugh, Mayor, A. S.\nPhipps, and E. H. Whitacre, City\nCouncil, appeared before the Board in\nj regard to the resolution filed by said\nCouncil on March 29, 1915, in regard\nto apportioning certain funds to city.\nSaid Council agreeing to waive any\ni sums before the filing of said resolu\ntion, if apportioned their proportion of\nsecond half of 191 taxes.\nRufus R. Smith, of Oakland, Cal.,\nappeared before the Board in regard\nto the Marchand Calculating Machine.\nA petition containing twenty-five\nnames of taxpayers and residents of\nWabuska, .Nevada, asking the Board\nto revoke the saloon license of Sam\n| Butulia of said place was received.\nSam Butulia and J. A. Guttery ap\npeared before the Board in regard to\nthe same. Ordered that matter be laid\nover until next meeting, so the Board\n, could investigate the same.\nResolution received from Trustees\nof Mason School District .Vo. 18 ask\ning Board to make a 25-cent special\ntax for school purposes. So ordered.\nOrdered that $1,00 be transferred\nfrom the General Road Fund to each\nDistrict Road Fund.\nCommunication received from Cora\nFay I\'errin in regard to county book\n| lets.\n, Complaint having been made to the\n| Board that parties were obstructing\nI the concrete bridge across the Mickey\nditch on the county road opposite the\nj I riedhoff ranch, it was ordered that\nthe matter be referred to the District\nVttorney and Commissioner Barlow.\nBoard adjourned until September 7.\n1915, 9 a. m.\nEMPIRE-NEVADA LEASES\nJoe Fabre lias secured and is work\nmg a lease a sliorl distance northwest\ni from the Dan Pennington lease on\ni the Empire Nevada estate. This prop\nerty i\' beig proved by the leasers to\nwhom all credit is due for their en\nj ergy and courage.\n\' that soldiers in considerable numbers\nwere crossing the border from Mexico\nj to join the alleged revolutionary\n! movement.\nGovernor Ferugson in his appeal to\nthe President, declared that any un\nit ual occurrence now would cause a\n| disastrous invasion of Texas from\nMexico. That a \'reign of terror” ex\nisted on the border, was the declara\ntion of tite Governor.\nThree more Mexican outlaws have\nbeen added to tile list of killed in bat\ntie near Mercedes, Hidalgo county.\nIt was not reported whether soldiers,\n■ county officers or rangers were in the\ntight. Officers have adopted a policy\n1 of refusing to give details of lights in\nwhich they were concerned. This is\nsaid to account for the lack of con\nfirmation of a report that eight other\nMexican bandits were killed in Hidal\ngo county since Friday.\nThe American trooper killed near\nMercedes, Texas, last Tuesday night\nina battle with raiders was Leo C\nVVindhnus, Troop C, 12th cavalry, ac\ncording to a report from General Fun\nston. \\\\ indhaiis\' home is given as 2d\nFast Orange street, Evansville, Ind\nIt was in the Mercedes skirmish a\nHag was captured bearing the words 1\n"Army of Liberty of Mexico and Tex\nas.” A handbill also was found read\ning:\n"Mexicans: Today we will accorn\nplish a sacred debt. The revolution\nhas acquired in a few days gigantic\nproportions. We unite as brothers to\nexpedite these fortunes of ours. In\nthe solemn moment we will vindicate\nout right- and ujetsievdia cmfwyppp\nour rights and justice for all time.\nMay the light shine upon us in all our\nundertakings and may it crown our\nforces in all manners. Contemplate\nthis movement initiated in Texas,\nwhich is of such consequence as to\nbring about the peace and justice we\nlong for.”\nTHE YERINGTON DAIRY\nTHE PITTSBUR6-D0L0RES\nj , .\nA number of miners are being added\nto the crew already employed by this\ncompany whose recent shipment of\nbullion was mentioned last week. Ad\nditional men will be employed for the\npurpose of further developing the un\nderground workings. It is the inten\ntion of the company to block out a\nyear’s supply of .ore for the mill and I\no keep ahead of the capacity of the .\nmill. The recovery of values from ores j\nGOOD CITIZENS\nHon. Barney H. Reymers and Mrs.\nReymers returned Wednesday from\nSan Francisco, where they have been\nfor the past two months. They vis\nited all points of interest on the coast\nand spent much time at the exposi\ntions, and Barney was one of the 35,\n000 German citizens in the big parade\nin San Francisco last week. He is\ngreatly improved in health, though\nduring the earlier part of his visit he\nsuffered considerably from the chill\nrains that prevailed on the coast. In\nspeaking of the parade, though it was\nan occasion in honor of the German I\nAmericans, the Senator said: “You\nshould have heard the crowds cheer\nthe Irish in the parade.” The remark\nbut indicates the spirit that prevails\namong good American citizens regard\nless of the nationality from which 1\nthey spring. Mr. Reymers was not\nborn in this country, but he has raised\na family of good native-born Ameri\ncans. The good citizen, by adoption,\nis the one who loves and is loyal to\nthe traditions of his fatherland, re\ngardless of the land of his\nbirth. Serious problems present them\nselves to this country to be solved,\nbut not for the first time. It has not\nbeen those who administer the affairs\ntreated is very successful and reaches\nfrom 90 per cent to 95 per cent of the\nmetals contained. The recovery of\ngold is nearly complete the losses\nbeing almost wholly silver. Tests of\nthe tailings are frequently being made\n: and show values that escape treatment\n! to be about 40 cents a ton. One test\nrecently made of the tailings run in\n| one shift disclosed but 28 cents per\nI ton. the principal value being silver,\n| with a trace only of gold.\n! QUARTERLY CONFERENCE\nDr. E. A. Palmer, Superintendent of\nMissions of the Methodist Church.\n; will be in Ycringlon Saturday and\nj Sunday, August 1-15, and will occupy\nI the pulpit both morning and evening\nSunday at the Methodist Church\nCmmunion service after the morning\nsermon, to which all Christian people\nare invited. The last Quarterly Con\nference for this conference year will\nbe held Saturday afternoon at 3:30\no’clock at the church. It is very nec\nessary that all the official members\nbe present at this meeting.\nFRANK SUMMERS, Pastor.\n; of government who have solved them,\nthough those in office have been lead\ners of the people, but it has been, in\nthe past as in the future, it will be the\n! intelligent people of the country who\nare entitled to credit for the solution.\nThis article is comment not discus\n! sion: it was suggested by the remarks\nmarie by the Senator at greeting the\nwriter on his return. Both he and\nhis wife are glad to "come home,” and\ntheir many friends are glad to greet\nthem and rejoice at his improvement\nin health. This little article is but a\nslight tribute, no more to him than to\n! all good citizens.\nMINING IN THE HILLS\nVISITORS\nE. J. Schrader, Superintendent of\nthe Pittsburg-Dolores, was in town\nyesterday on his way to Reno to meet j\nhis sister, who is on her way to the |\nexposition. It is the first time Mr.\nSchrader and his sister have met since\nthe latter\'s return from Europe, where\nshe was presented to the German Em\nI peror. Miss Schrader will return with\nj her brother and visit a short time in\nYerington and at the mine before pro\nceeding on her journey. Her home\nis St. Paul, Minnesota. We are fur\nther informed that Miss Schrader is a\ngraduate of the University of Minne\nsota, which was among the lirst of the\nState Universities to admit women.\nThis item was intended only as a\npersonal, hut as our linotype is “eat\ning copy,” and our operator is yelling\nfor more, we will add that the Minne\nsota University is one of the famous\ninstitutions of the country and is par\ntieularly notable for its School of\nMines, and the Agricultural College\nwhich has done efficient work in im\nproving and propogating higher\ngrades of wheat, for which Minnesota,\nthe Red River Valley, the Dakotas and\nPortage Plain are so well known.\n$47,000 DOWN ON RACES\nAt the Reno races on Saturday, Ne\nvada Derby day, a tritle more titan\n$47,(XX) was registered on the ppari\nimituel machines, which is a record\nbreaking mark for the meeting to date\nAbout $11,(KX) was invested on the\nDerby race alone.\n$100,000 MINE SALE\nThe Delaware mine in the Seven\nI Troughs district has been sold t Huttc\nI parties, headed by John McGinnis.\nThe same interests have taken a bond\nand lease on the Darby mill at Seven\nTroughs. This is a tube mill with a\ndaily capacity of 50 tons and cost\nmore than $100,000.\nTHE UNIVERSITY\nOne-fifth of the students in the Uni\nversity of Nevada last year were from\nCalifornia.\nOut of 469 students enrolled in all\nthe departments, colleges, short\ncourses and summer schools, 117 were\nfrom States other than Nevada and of\nthese 89 were from California. More\nover 66 of these students were taking\nthe regular four-year college courses\nin arts and sciences, engineering and\nagriculture.\nThe significance of this outside en\nrollment, and more particularly from\nfrom California, is that the University\n| of Nevada is becoming a recognized\nfactor in Western educational circles. \'\nAnd why should it not be? It is\njust about the right size for the best\ninstruction any student can get; name\nly, close contact with his or her in - ;\nstructors. More«ver, the equipment\nfor imparting knowledge is modern in\nevery sense, and the University fac\nulty is recognized everywhere as an\nexceptionally strong one.\nIt is the place for Nevada young\nmen and women tr> get their college\ntraining. That fact is emphasized in\nthe story of the success of the U. of N\nAlumni. The University opens August\n10, and this year’s attendance is ex\npected to surpass all past records.\nFOLLOW SUIT!\nA series of misunderstandings and\nfritter disputes between the two larg\nest cities of a State, located within .17\nmiles of each other, can do neither\ncity any good but cm do the State\nconsiderable harm. As a satisfactory\nsettlement is now in sight it is just as\nwell not to go into the history of this\nlong drawn out fight, but rather let as\nhope that the setlement will be final\nand that Ogden and Salt Lake will\npull together for Utah instead of pull\ning apart just for the fun they get out\nI of pulling.—Ogden Examiner.\nBOARD EQUALIZATION PROCEEDINGS\nThe assessment of J. R. Conser was\nreduced $70.\nJay Clemens, representing the An\ntelope Valley Land & Cattle Com\npany, appeared before the Board in\nregard to reclassifying pasture land,\n1,445 acres in all.\nOn motion above land v/as reduced\n$2.50 per acre.

Webster reduced on barber\nWELL-KNOWN ELECTRICAL I\nMAN VISITS THE CAMP\nMr. N. K. Cooper, of San Francisco, I\nrepresentative of the Westinghouse\nElectric and Manufacturing Company, :\naccompanied by Mr. T. R. Landsbor\nugh, electrical engineer of the Tono\npah Extension, were in the city on\nMonday. They were traveling by auto\nto Tonopah, and while here Mr. Coop\ner, who is acquainted with the district,\nwas busy looking after the interests\nof his company, which undoubtedly,\nin the near future, will install a num\nber of electrical appliances in differ\nent plants in contemplation on the\nvarious properties being worked. The\nWestinghouse people supplied much of\nthe machinery to the Ludwig leaching\nplant described in our last issue. Mr.\nCooper said that there was every in\ndication of a healthy revival of interest\nin the development of the copper mines\nin the Yerington district. Mr. Cooper |\nwill soon again visit Yerington. The j\ninterest shown by large institutions\nlike this is the strongest indication j\nthat it is time to prepare and be ready\nto take advantage of the opportunities\nknocking at the door.\nSTAG PARTY AT MASON\nAn informal stag party was given\nby Attorney Milo Lang and Vernon\nPetersen at their apartments over the\nMason Valley Drug Store to a num\nher of Yerington people last Tuesday\nevening. Among the guests were Su\nperintendent Cook of the Copper Belt.\nChris Petersen, the electriccian for the\ntownsite people, the Leichtenstein\nBrothers, J. 1. Wilson and others. The\nentertainment consited of a discussion\nof the conditions, progress and wel\nfare of the county, a piano recital,\nsongs, stories, refresments and the\ngeneral good fellowship of a congenial\ncrowd prevailed. Mr. Cook\'s songs,\nstories and reminiscences were especi\nally entertaining and the party dis\npersed at a seasonable hour, we pre\n: sume because the married men hail to\n\' go home and the unmarried and those\nwhose wives are at the exposition did\nnot wish to wear out the cordial wel\ncome of their hosts. Cook left first.\nKidder was late to dinner and his de\nj tention from the party was regretted\nby all.\nNOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS\'\nMEETING\nThee will be a meeting of the stock\nholders of the Fox Ditch Company on\nTuesday, the 24th day of August, 1915,\nat the office of the company, in Yer\nington, Nevada, at 1 p. m.\nBy order of the President,\nAd vt\nfixtures $50.\nE.

Mayne reduced on Masonic\nand Workmen’s Hall $00.\nAdded to Amity Lodge No. 4, .F.\nand A. M„ Silver City, $400.\nFred Brauus, representing the S. P.\nCo., appeared before the Board in re\ngard to the assessment of lands of\nsaid company, and asked for a change\nin classification as follows:\nFrom 15,000 acres sage, first, at\n$5; 69,519 acres sage, second, at $2.50;\n.32JR58 ffiffrli sage, mountain, $1.25, to\n15,702 acres sage, 101,666 acres moun\ntain.

Wilson reduced $625 on past\nure land.\nWILL BRING BELGIAN\nCOLONISTS TO NEVADA\nAs the result of the visit to San\nFrancisco of YV. W. Griffin, who has\n: returned after an absence of ten days\npapers will be tiled in a* few days in\ni corporating a big development and\ncolonization company whose purpose\nis to deal extensively in agricultural\nmatters in the western part of this\nState. Mr. Griffin says the company\nwill be made up of men, principally\nCalifornians, who are amply able\nfinancially to carry through any ven\nture they undertake and realizing the\nopportunities that Nevada presents\nthey have selected this State as a field\nof operation. If their plans carry, and\nj of this there is no doubt, a large Bel\ngian colony ill be located here.—Car\nson Appeal.\n“LIQUOR CENSOR”\nLIMITS ALLOWANCE\nR. D. Mason, "liquor censor” by vir\ntue of his appointment by the\nCity Council, has reported that on his\nfirst day of work he had sent back\nto breweries thirty barrels of beer out\nof sixty received in Mason City, Iowa.\n! He is compiling a list of the thirsty\n! population of the city and expects to\nj see that they do not overdo their\ni liquor orders. "One barrel or three\n[ eases of beer and one gallon of whisky\n! is as much as any one man should\nhave in one month without a phy\nsician’s prescription,” said Mr. Mason.\n—Exchange.\nThe above would indicate that the\naverage thirst in Iowa greatly exceeds\nthat which prevails in Nevada.\nAPPOINTED BY GOVERNOR\nGovernor Boyle has appointed S.\nM. Wolf, Metropolis; G. M Bowers,\nLamoille; Charles B. Knight, Univer\nsity of Nevada, Reno, and Prof. S. B.\ni Doteti, Director of the Agricultural\n| Experiment Station at Reno, as dele\ngates to represent Nevada at the In\nternational Dry-Farming Congress\nand Soil-Products Exposition to be\nheld at Denver, September 27 to Oc\ntober 9, 1915.\nC. F. Burt, cyanide man at the Pitts\nburgh-Dolores, who has been in the\nMason Hospital for treatment for ton\nsilitis, passed through town yesterday\non his way to the exposition for a va\ncation. H. J. Wasson, general utility\nengineer for the same company, who\nhas been similarly and at the same\ntime entertained at the Mason Hos\npital by Dr. Edwards, was a visitor\nyesterday. Mr. Wasson returned to\nthe mine todav.\nHAY-MAKING SCENE', 'The Yerington Times\nPublished Weekly by Warren Hauser and Stanley L.

It certainly seems that a more enlightened and humane\nmanner of treating crime and criminals than present and past meth\nods should be reached in this age when education is the rule aim\nilliteracy the exception. The European war, however, shows that\neducation and religion has wholly failed to eliminate the lust for\nconquest at any cost of human life. Many philosophers have com\npared the warrior with the murderer and it certainly seems that\nwar is hut wholesale murder.\nFew criminals would offend against the law were it not for the\nindividual desire of conquest, the determination to get something\ndesired or to attain some end or object.\nThe discussion as to the propriety of abolishing capital punish\nment in Nevada has occurred from time to time almost since the ad\nmission of the State and it seems that more determined effort was\nmade at the last session of the Legislature than at any previous\ntime. Whether the present law passed by the Legislature is the re\nsult of a joker injected into the act by some person determined to\nobtain his object, that of abolishing capital punishment, or whether\nit is the result of a mistake on the part of the author of the bill,\nor of the Committee, or of the engrossing clerk, capital punishment\nwas not abolished.\nWe now, in fact, have a nondescript law. Extremely\nrarely is murder “perpetrated by means of poison, or lying in wait,\nor torture, or committed in the perpetration, or attempt to perpe\ntrate, any arson, rape, robbery or burglary, or committed by a con\nvict in the State prison serving a sentence of life imprisonment,,\nwhich are the only homicides under the present law constituting\nmurder in the first degree.\nAttention is called to the condition of the present law by Judge\nTaber, at Elko, in sentencing the brutal assassin, Salgado, who\nwas convicted some time previously for the murder of a woman and\nsentenced to death. At the time of his conviction and sentence the\nold law was in effect. Owing to error in one of the instructions to\nthe jury the Supreme Court ordered a new trial, at which Salgado\nwas again convicted, but because of the omission of a few words\nthe degree of crime of which he could be convicted was murder in\nthe second degree.\nThe crime for which he was convicted was as clearly proven -\nand was as brutal, malicious, wicked and vicious as any of the acts i\nwhich now constitute murder in the first degree and yet the extreme\npenalty which can be imposed on this wretch is imprisonment in\nthe penitentiary for not less than ten years and which may be ex\ntended to life.\nThe illustrations given by Judge Taber are trite and appropri\nate, among them is one that will appeal to most people and it is this:\n“If my wife had a life insurance of $10,000 and I wou\'d like, in a\ncouple of years, to marry a younger girl of great beauty or fascina\ntion, the next time my wife was taking a bath I could catch her and\nhold her head under the water and murder her, that would be mur\nder in the second degree.”\nMany remember the murder of Catherine Ging, committed in\nMinneapolis by Harry Hayward for a $20,000 life insurance carried\nfor his benefit by his victim, to whom he was engaged to marry.\nAbout the same time the famous Holmes murders occurred. This\nmurderer put to death a number of persons at Philadelphia and Chi\ncago to get the small amount of insurance fraudulently secured by\nhim on the lives of the persons he killed—ten or twelve in number.\nHayward was hanged in Minneapolis, and Holmes in Philadelphia.\nNumerous other cases have occurred in this country where small\namounts of insurance were the motives which induced the murders.\nAll these crimes can now be committed in Nevada with absolute\ncertainty that the perpetrator can avoid the death penalty if detected\nand convicted.\nIt is a matter of but very slight concern to the lawyer, but is\nof most vital importance to the citizens of the State, il the people\nof the State of Nevada feel that capital punishment is wrong tin*\nlaw should be changed. If they are in favor of capita! punishment\nthe law should not be framed so that the possible might occur at\nany time where a half-witted convict might be executed for killing\na brutal guard under circumstances that, if the slayer were not a\nconvict, would be justifiable or excusable, while brutes like Salgado\nescape hanging.\n- ■■■ -O\nOPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITY TEAMWORK\nIn another column we publish an account, written for the San\nFrancisco Chronicle, of a new road over the Sierras. The rebuild\ning of the old Tioga trail and making it accessible to automobile\ntravel will divert many tourists using this mode of travel through\nthe rich valleys in Lyon county. A little team work with our neigh\nbor, Churchill county, the improvement of the roads in Lyon\ncounty from Fernley and Lahontan will open a route from Mono\nLake through either Mason or Smith Valley past the old Auckland\nRanch, now generally known as the Towle Ranch to Lahontan or/\nFernley and past Fallon.\nWhile the auto travel from the east to the Exposition is not what\nwas hoped it would be, yet its effect will be more noticible in the\nyears to follow. Churchill and Lyon counties comprise the Eighth\nJudicial District and have many interests in common. The two\ncounties have the same class of enterprising citizens. Everything\nthat benefits one helps the other, and what is to the advantage of\nboth adds to the material welfare of the whole State. No commun\nity should seek advantage over its neighbor. W e can not draw\nfrom each other. Nevada will draw from the overcrowded parts of\nthe East, from the young of the old settled parts of the country\nwhere young men and young women seek fields of effort restricted\nin their home communities. The States west of the Rockies afford\nroom for such, and they will come in greater numbers after the\ngreat Pacific Expositions hqve accomplished their educational work.\nAlready the movement has begun to organize colonization com\npanies by men of affairs and with means to accomplish their pur\npose, to bring people to the western part of the State where thous\nands of acres of rich land lie waiting for reclamation.\n-«—o-■\nCapital punishment deters murder. It is a well-known fact that\nmen convicted of this crime prefer life imprisonment to hanging.\nCharles Becker, recently executed, furnished additional proof by\ntrying to get his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, yet the\npapers detailed the courage which he walked to his doom.\nPYORRHEA ALVEOLARIS\nIt is scarcely necessary to call the\nattention of the general public to the\nprevalence of Pyorrhea Alveolaris\n(Rigg\'s Disease) and to its detri\nmental effect on the health of the in\ndividual. No other common disease is\nso frequently allowed to go untreat\ned. It is not only the cause of foul\nbreath, ulcerated and receding gums\nand loss of teeth, but also is a prime\nfactor in inviting arthritis, neuritis,\nintestinal toxermias and hemic ane\nmias.\nEndameba Buccalis\nPronzek described the endameba\nbuccalis in 1904; but this protozan or\nganism was not credited with patho\ngenicity until 1914, when Drs. Barrett\nand Smith, of Philadelphia, observed I\nits presence in forty-six cases of py- j\norrhea.\nEmetine Locally\nKnowing that emetine, one of the\nalkaloids of ipecac, possessed specific\nendamebicidal action, Barrett and\nSmith treated thirteen cases of py\norrhea by injecting daily, for five or\nsix days, a one-half per cent solution\nof emetine directly into the pyorrheal\npockets. The rapidity with which the\npus disappeared and the lesions healed\nwas remarkable. This method has\nsinee proven successful in the hands\nof many dentitsts.\nDental Treatment Necessary\nAleresta ipecac is a specific for the\ntreatment of pyorrhea, hut it must not\nbe expected that large, chronic pus\npockets will heal in a few days under\nits influence. Aleresta ipecac will re\nmove the cause of the disease, but it\nremains for nature, aided by proper\ndental treatment to effectually close\nup the abscess pockets, which may re\nquire from a few weeks to several\nmonths, depending upon the nature\nand extent of the lesions. No case !\nof pyorrhea should be treated without \'\nreceiving at the same time proper in\nstrumentation. Thorough, but care\nful cleaning of the teeth, scaling and (\n1 -\nessary, removing necrosed tissue is\nabsolutely essential to success.\nRelapse or Reinfection\nIt should not be expected that one\ntreatment in the dental chair or one\ncourse of alcresta ipecac will cure any\nbut the mildre forms of the disease.\nHowever, it is safe to say that after\na course of alcresta ipecac not a single\nmotile endemeba will be found in any\nof the pyorrheal lesions. No strong\nproof of the specific ambecidal ac\ntion could be desired.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion it may be said that\nthere is now placed within reach of\nevery dentist a convenient and prac\ntical means of treating a widely prva\nlent and very refractory disease.\nFor consultation or treatment call i\non your home dentist.\nDR.

Some\nmisunderstanding has arisen from the\nfact that thev arious State laws do\nnot always conform to the Federal\nregulations. This is regarded as un\nfortunate, but in such cases the Deprt\nment must insist upon the observance\nof thi Federal regulations.\nThe Department will consider any\nrecommendations submitted in good\nfaith for amendment of the regula\ntions, but will hold no public hearings\nthereon, nor will it amend the regula\ntions prior to October IS, 1915. It is\nthe purpose of the Department to con\nform the regulations to the wishes of\nthe majority of sportsmen so far as it\ncan be done and at the same time give\nwild fowl the necessary protection.\nFederal regulations divide the Uni\nted States into two zones. Zone No. 1\n1, the breeding zone, includes the\nStates of Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, I\nNebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, j\nOhio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey,\nand all States north of them.

The road\ncrew, which has been divided into\nthree camps, has done some good\nwork in removing boulders and fallen\ntrees and widening the path in several\nplaces. But, like all new roads, there\nare many soft spots, and a driver must\nuse extreme care in the way he nego\ntiates these places, for in many in\nstances they are deep holes and fills\nover crevices worked in the pathway\nby melting snow.\nDescribing the trip a “Chalmers" en\nthusiast says: “Starting from San\nFrancisco, after crossing the bay, the\nparty drove out of Oakland to Mo\nA Good Household Salve\nOrdinary ailments and injuries are\nnot of theniosleves serious, but infec\ntion or low vitality may make them\ndangerous.

From\nModesto tlie road to Coulteville was\ntaken, and upon arriving at this quaint\nold mining camp we put up for the\nnight. Next morning the road was\ntaken again and Crockers was made in\ntime for luncheon. Starting from\nCrockers the party soon came to the\njunction of the old Tioga road and\nBig Oak Hat road, where the former\nroad was taken, and the drive into the\ncountry unknown to motorists began.\n. Enchanting Views Obtained\n“Winding through primeval groves\nof trees, this road presents to the\nlover of nature endless vistas of for\nest and mountain scenes, and as >t\ndips down to cross the south fork of\nthe Tuolumne river, provides some of\nthe most enchanting views ohtainabli\nanywhere.\n"Front the south fork of the Tuol\numne (where one of the United States\nGovernment construction camps is lo\ncated), the road swings slightly mirth,\nuntil Harden Lake trail is passed;\nthence south with many pleasing me\nanderings, until the Tuolumne-Mari\nposa county line is reached. From\nhere the road runs on till it crosses\nthe Yosemite Creek and on past the\nYosemite Falls trail to Snow Creek.\n“From Snow Creek on to the sum\nmit of the range just before Lake Ten\naya is reached some hard climbing\nwas encountered, after negotiating\nwhich the party drove into camp at\nLake Tenaya for the night.\n“Owing to a severe storm and\ncloudburst in the higher mountains\nthe day before, the roads had been\nwashed out above in many places and\nwe were forced to wait at Lake Ten\naya camp for several days until they\ncould be put into shape again. While\nthere we were the guests of F-lbert E.\nNewell and Mrs. Newell, who did ev\nerything to make the enforced stay\nagreeable.\nPimples, Skin Blemishes, Eczema\nCured\nNo odds how serious, how long\nstanding your case, there\'s help for\nyou in every particle of Dr. Hobson’s\nEczema Ointment, it wipes all trace\nEczema Ointment.

The next day the road\nfor the summit and Mono Lake was\nagain taken and after an interesting\nand wonderfully beautiful drive we\nreached the former spt.\n"The summit of the Tioga Pass road\nis the highest of any of the Trans\nserra roads and crosses the moun\ntains at an altitude of 9,941 feet.\n“From here the road rapidly de\nscends oil the eastern slopes of the\nmountains, running through gorges,\nbetween cliffs of granite and thread\ning its way along the edges ofawe\ninspiring precipices which shoot up\nfrom deep canyons below.\n"Reaching the head of Lee Vining\nc myon, the State road, built by for\nmer State Engineer Ellery, which\nleads to Mono Lake, was taken by the\nmotorists, and a magnificent scenic\ndrive down its nine miles to Mono\nLake completed the trip.\n“After a day spent at Mono Lake,\nthe party returned back over the same\nroute except that a detour was made\nin the Yosemite Valley.\n“The following distances were re\ncorded by the auto’s speedomter:\nSan Francisco to Modesto, 86 miles;\nModesto to Coulterville, 58 miles;\nCoulterville to Crockers, 28 miles;\nCrockers to Lake Tenaya, 37 miles;\nLake Tenaya to Tuolumne Meadows,\n(Sierra Club,) miles; Tuolumne\nMeadows to Summit, 9 miles; Summit\nto Mono Lake, 19 miles.\nDesponedency Due to Indigestion\n"About three months ago when I\nwas suffering from indigestion which\ncaused headache and dizzy spells and\nmade me feel tired and despondent,\n1 began taking Chamberlain’s Tab\nlets,” writes Mrs. Geo.

The markets\nin San Francisco and Oakland have\nbeen quite steady recently as there has\nbeen a little improvement in the de\nmand for hay used for local purposes,\nand, therefore, a little bit stronger sit\nuation has been thereby developed.\nConsumers are now coming into the\nmarket and inquiring for their hay\nfor winter purposes and a better feel\ning generalyy is shown.\nFancy offerings are readily placed\nand No. 1 consignments have also\nmoved off satisfactorily. Low type\nhay has been difficult to place as con\nsumers show decided preference for\ngood hay at fair prices and are not\ni attracted to the poorest types even at\nthe low prices prevailing.\nMuch hay is still being absorbe by\nthe export trade and our general mar\nI kets have been strengthened all along\nthe line by the large amounts that\nhave been shipped out of the State for\nthis purpose.\nThe old hay has been pactically\ncleaned up. A large proportion of j\nthe hay crop of good grade has al i\nready been sold by the farmers. In i\nthose sections where there was still ^\n^ some unsold, steadv buying has been |\ngoing on during the week and lots\nI that now remain in the farmers’ hands j\nj tire generally being held at higher val I\nnation. Some round lots of poor hay!\nhave been reported sold this week.\nMuch of it was arrange 1 to be placed\nfo rinterior uses and will not come\nto San Francisco or burden this\n| market.\ni Alfalfa arrivals have been moderate\nand these have consisted mainly of\ni hay coming in from the Sacmmento|\nGARANZA SHOWS HIS TEETH\nGeneral Caranza, through his\nagency in Washington, lias authorized\nthe publication of a scathing arraign\nment of the Pan-American confer\nence, the White House, and financial\nintersts on both sides of the border.\nIt was written by General Heriberto\nJara, constitutionalist, who says in\npart: “If the Washington govern\nment considers that the highway rob\nbery bandits of Wall street are worth\nier of protection and esteem than the\nautonomy of Mexico, 1 energetically\nprotest an outrage of such a character.\nIt cannot be justified in the name of\ncivilization or the principles of hu\nmanity.” The article pledges the sol\ndiers’ support to Carranza and compli\ncates the Mexican situation and con\nstitutes a practical defiance of Ameri\nca. It is known the administration\nintends to answer it. The Carranza\nista agency has also published tele\ngram from eleven generals, including\nObregon, Gonzales and Trevino, \'\npledging loyalty to Genarl Carranza.\nJara’s message is regarded as insult\ning and many think it is designed to\ncompel hostile American action as a\nmeans of consolidating Mexican fac\ntions. The Latin Americans refuse to\nendorse intervention, and if America\nintervenes it will be opposed. The\nborder situation is temporarily more\nalarming than at Mexico City and\nVera Cruz. Mexicans are organizing\na revolt against American power along\nthe border. The gunboat Sacramento\nhas left Vera Cruz with the Brazilian\nand Guatemalan ministers and their\nfamilies.\nTHREE CARS OF\nANTIMONY BRING\n$5,000 RETURNS\nIn the past sixty days three carloads\nof antimony have been shipped out of\nHumboldt county to New York and\nLos Angeles, bringing returns of $5,\n500. In another two months this sum\nwill be duplicated if not doubled. All\n! of this antimony has come from within\na radius of thirty miles of Lovelock. 1\ni the largest deposits being within 14\nmiles, says the Review Miner.\nOf the old properties that have been\nbrought to life by higher prices are\n! the old Sutherland or Black Knob\nmine about 5 miles from the Nevada\nj Packard, now being operated by E.\n| C. Miller of the Magnolia Metal Com\npany, New York and San Francisco;\nand the Bloody Canyon property, 14\nmiles from Mill City, owned by the\nFirst National Bank of Winnemucca. j\nNO APOLOGY\n“Our artist” disappointed us this\nweek in not getting the ilustrations we 1\nintended to use to show the farming\ndevelopments we desired to "feature"\non the front page.
