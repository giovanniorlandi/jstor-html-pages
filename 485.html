        <pre>['Reviews 155 \ngiven ß1, ß2 a considerably extended version of which has been published in Biometrika \n(1960) 50, 459. The statistical problem involved is the calculation of the percentage \npoints of the total claim distribution, given the distribution of claim frequencies and the \nconditional distribution of the amounts of a claim. The classical approach is to treat the \nproblem as a compound Poisson distribution and to use the Esscher approximation \nor one or other of the methods developed more recently, including Monte Carlo tech- \nniques. However, provided the moments of the two basic distributions are known, the \nmoments of the required distribution are easily calculated and the tables can be used \neither to find the standardized deviation for a given percentage point or they can be \nused inversely to find the percentage for a given deviation. The main limitation is that \nthe region of interest is at the ·l% level which falls outside the range currently tabulated \nand an extension would avoid some dubious extrapolations. \nIt is hardly possible to comment in any detail on the wide range of the tables. The \nintroduction, which gives an adequate description of the various tables and of the pur- \nposes they serve, has been extended to include the additional tables. The printing and \nlayout is of the usual high standard for long associated with Biometrika and the Cam- \nbridge University Press and the price is still very low. Many of the tables have a long \nhistory behind them and can be used with confidence as having been freed from errors; a \nsearch through Biometrika and Mathematics of Computation failed to produce any re- \nported corrections to the newer material. In places the printing as compared with the \nfirst edition is slightly less crisp and there is a certain unevenness, but these are minor \nblemishes in this ‘must’ for the practising statistician. \nR. E. BEARD \nSymmetric Function and Allied Tables. BY F. N. DAVID, M. G. KENDALL and D. E. \nBARTON. \n[pp. x+278, Cambridge: Published for the Biometrika Trustees at the University Press, \n1966.70s.] \nALL actuaries will have met combinatorial algebra in their studies for the mathematics \nand probability sections of the examinations. More-recently qualified members of the \nprofession will be aware that the calculation of moments of statistical criteria involve \nthe use of combinatorial methods but probably only those specializing in the subject of \nstatistics will have the occasion to be aware of the tedious algebra that can be avoided \nby the use of the results of researches in the last thirty years. \nThis handsome volume of tables is a compilation of tables which have been developed \nprimarily by the authors over recent years to reduce statistical moment problems to a \nstraightforward procedure. Many of the tables have appeared in Biometrika and are \nthus well known to statisticians but, by their collection into one volume, with certain \nadditions, the authors have provided a very valuable and convenient source for those \nwhose work and interest lies in this field. \nThe book is divided into two main sections; Parts I-IX which consists of definitions, \nformulae and applications of the various tables; and the tables themselves, numbered to \ncorrespond to the descriptive material. Sources and prior tables are quoted, together \nwith two bibliographies but no index, although the four contents pages are fairly well \ndetailed. \nThere are 49 tables and it is hardly possible to describe the scope without repeating \nthe detailed description but the following brief classification of the contents will show \nthe wealth of material which has been collected together. \n', '156 \nPurr I (7 tables). Symmetric functions. The first 5 of these are the basic tables for the \nremainder of the book. They were originally compiled by David and Kendall from \n1949 to 1955 and are concerned, for example, with the relations between power sums \nand augmented unitary symmetric functions \nPart II (6 tables). Moments, Cumulants and k-functions. The first two tables give the rela- \ntions between moments and cumulants for univariate and bivariate cases up to and \nincluding weight 8. The remaining tables are concerned with Fisher’s k-statistics and \npoly-kay functions. \nPart III (3 tables). Sampling of k-statistics and moments of moments. The first table \nrelates to single k-statistics and the second to bivariate statistics and an infinite popula- \ntion. The third deals with k-statistics and a finite population. \nPart IV. Partitions. Two tables giving the number of partitions of an integer n ; n = l(1)35 \nand the number of bipartitions into r biparts of the number mn; n = 1(1)16, n m, \nm + n 16, v = 1(1)m. The use for these tables arises in applications of combinatory \ntheory. \nPart V. Quantities based on the first n natural numbers (12 tables). Some of the tables in \nthis part are well known such as values of the combinatorial coefficient nCr, Bernoulli \npolynomials and numbers, Stirling’s numbers of the first and second kind (differences of \nzero). Others such as the differences of reciprocals of unity, poly-kays of the first N \nnatural numbers, asymmetric sums of the products of natural numbers, the distribution \nof rank sums (Wilcoxon’s statistic) and the distribution of Cns for Kendall’s and \nMann’s Tare of more recent interest. \nPart VI. ‘Runs’ distributions (6 tables). Various topics are covered such as the distribution \nof multiple runs, ring runs and the longest run of two colours. \nPart VII. Randomization distributions (10 tables). These are the distributions of various \nstatistics used as test criteria for randomness of order in time and are based on the pattern \nof the signs of successive rank differences. \nPart VIII. Tables for the solutions of the exponential equations. \nexp (–a) + ka = 1 and exp b – b / (1– p) = 1. \nTable 8.1 gives the values of a from the first equation to 7 dec. places for k = \n·05(·001)1·000. \nTable 8.2 gives the values of b to 7 dec. places for p = ·000(·001)1·000. These tables \nhave a number of uses, one of the examples shown being the estimation by maximum \nlikelihood of the parameter of a Poisson distribution of which the zero group is missing. \nPart IX. Partition coefficients for the inversion of functions. The tables of Part I can be \nused for expanding the function of a function but Table IX has been prepared for direct \napplication in this type of problem, which also includes the inversion of functions. \nThe user of these tables will be concerned regarding their accuracy. Most of them are \nnot susceptible to checks of the difference type and a glance will show the difficulties \ninvolved in ensuring accuracy. The basic tables in Part I are identical in fount and format \nwith their originals in Biometrika and can be used with the same confidence. Others \nhave been reset and the possibility of error cannot be overlooked, although past ex- \nperience with Biometrika tables and the Cambridge University Press is so good that the \nrisk of error is slight. One unfortunate error is in Table 5.3.1, Stirling’s Numbers of the \nsecond kind. These have clearly been taken from the table of an early edition of Fisher \nReview \n', 'Reviews 157 \nand Yates which had a number of errors, corrected in the 4th edition. (See J.I.A. 76, \n152-63, where an extension of the tables is also given.) \nNo other errors in the tabular material were detected, and the nature of the tables \nwould make them extremely difficult to find, but it was noted that the last term of the \nrecurrence formula at the top of p. 44 had a wrong suffix (Cn - 1 s - 1 should be Cn - 1 s-n \nand the last entry for the coefficient of m2 in Table 5.2.2. should read 3327584 instead of \n332758 as printed. However, these are unfortunate minor blemishes in the material \nsupplementary to the main tables. \nThe Biometrika Trustees have again earned the gratitude of statisticians by providing \nthis compendium at a price which is very reasonable by any standards and few can afford \nto be without it. \nR. E. BEARD \nResearch Papers in Statistics; Festschrift for J. Neyman. Edited by F. N. DAVID. \n[Pp. viii + 467. London: John Wiley and Sons, 1966. 105s.] \nEVERY profession has its colourful characters, who erupt on the scene from time to \ntime and whose writings and actions become a byword. Anyone asked to name the \ncolourful characters in statistics during the first half of the twentieth century would \nassuredly include Jerzy Neyman. The reviewer entered the statistical scene only after the \nSecond World War, but student memories linger of surreptitious reading of the written \nbattles in the pre-war journals between Neyman and R. A. Fisher, surreptitious because \nthe subject-matter was far removed from one’s task of the moment. At a later stage the \nfirst meeting with Neyman, this time in Berkeley in 1954, was an unforgettable experi- \nence, the conversation rapidly becoming a monologue on how to test for outliers dis- \nguised behind a question as to what research was going on in University College. \nThe present volume was designed to mark the occasion, in 1964, of Neyman’s 70th \nbirthday and consists of 26 papers contributed by authors from many lands and covering \nmany different topics. Contributors include M. S. Bartlett, J. Berkson, D. R. Cox, H. \nCramer, U. Grenander, P. Levy, P. A. P. Moran, E. S. Pearson, G. Polya, C. R. Rao, \nH. Solomon, P. V. Sukhatme and H. Wold. Since the papers vary enormously in subject- \nmatter, it would be impossible to provide a comprehensive review, and four of them will \nbe selected, some because of their relationship to Neyman’s own work, and others \nbecause of the interest they hold for future research work. \nThe first paper of the volume is an historical account, by E. S. Pearson, of the Pearson- \nNeyman research collaboration over the period 1926-34 when Neyman was in Warsaw \nand Pearson in London. This collaboration led, of course, to the so-called Neyman- \nPearson theory of the testing of hypotheses and the developments leading to the central \nPhilosophical Transactions paper of 1933. It is a human story, told with a delightful \ntouch of modesty and full of revealing sidelights, from the meeting between the tongue- \ntied research student and junior lecturer in Karl Pearson’s department to the same Ney- \nman returning to E. S. Pearson’s department on the staff in 1934. When names in science \nare ineradicably linked they are usually those of geographically close colleagues, and \nseldom those separated by a continent as well as by language. Would that it could \nhappen as readily today! \nBerkson’s paper is on tests of randomness with particular reference to a large set of \ndata relating to the emission of α -particles. He shows the advantages and disadvantages \nof the standard x2 test for this purpose, discussing the optimum choice of class interval \nfor the length of time between emissions. Next he discusses the distribution of n, the \nnumber of emissions in a fixed time interval T, and considers the effect of using different \n']</pre>
