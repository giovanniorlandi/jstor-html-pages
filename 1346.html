ROGERS\nThe man looked at his companion\nwonderingly. “So,” he said at last,\nalmost to himself, “it’s only a Joke to\nto you!”\nFor answer she smiled at him a lit\ntle uncertainly, but still sheltered with\na touch of the triumphant assurance\nwhich had first attracted him.\nHigh up on the slope of the foot\nhills they sat under the shade of some\nscrub cedars.\nBelow them, over a descending vis\nta of 30 miles of palo greens and lav\nenders and blues of the land under\nthe California sun, the ocean shim\nmered in the distance. It was very\nstill about them, for the bordered\npath behind led to a fountain in ruins\nand beyond that a deserted mansion\nfaded under the sunlight, desolate.\nThey had climbed there because he\nbad wanted to show her the view, one\nof the finest in that part of the state.\nShe had come with her mother among\nthe swarms of winter visitors flock\ning to the southern coast, and when\nhe had first seen her Dr. Duval had\nstepped Inside a magic circle from\nwhich there was no escape.\nHe was used to the winter visitors,\nInured to the sparkling, pretty girls\nfrom the east, always healthily, un\nemotionally amused by their girlish\nflirtations, their guileless smiles at\nhim, one of the few bachelors at the\nhotel.\nHe could not explain why, when he\nhad met Gertrude Whitcomb that first\nnight he had been so immediately en\nthralled. Bhe had regarded him disin\nterestedly, rather coldly, until he had\nexerted himself to bring forth a\nsmile of Interest—and when Dr. Duval\nchose to talk one listened. He had\nwatched the faint blush rise to the\npale oval of her face and seen her\ngreat eyes darken and he had\nbrought a ripple of laughter to her\nlips—and her laugh wai music.\nFrom that evening be waa much in\nher company, and she permitted it, ln-\nThs Girl’s Face Grew Berious.\ndolently, gracious and amused. So\nthey had drifted through the weeks\nand the winter was nearing Its close.\nShe regarded him a little specula\ntively, as though surprised at the feel\ning in his voice. “I had no Idea,"\nshe said, slowly, "that you really\nCared. I thought It was Just —”\n"You did not think at all!" Dr. Du\nval Interrupted her brusquely. "It\nnever entered your head to wonder\nwhether I were falling In love with\nyou—whether it meant anything seri\nous to me. You are so used to admi\nration that one man more or less\nmeans little to you and, besides, you\ndid not care for me. If you had —\ntell me, Gertrude, haven\'t you ever\nmet any one you cared about?"\nThe girl’s face grew serious and she\nlooked out over the valley. "No," she\nsaid carelessly. Tm afraid not. I\ndon’t want to—life Is too full of Inter\nesting things!" She turned and\nlaughed at him again, and he noticed\nfor the first time that her smile was\nunfeeling. Then she sprang to her\nfeet lightly. “Come, let’s walk on,”\nshe ordered. "And we won\'t talk of\nthis again.”\n"No," said Dr. Duval bitterly, “never\nagain!”\nAll the way down the winding trail\nGertrude was a-sparkle with laughter <\nand fun, but the man did not hear\nher. At one turn he had a glimpse,\nfar In the distance below, of a ram- \'\nbling structure burled In vines and\nflowers and again bis conscience re- i\nproached him. The rambling cottage\nhad seen little of him this winter, and 1\nAUNT HANNAH HAD TO RIDE\n1\nMrs. Sangster’s Amusing Story of Her\nColored Cook in Old Vir\nginia Days.\nWhen Mrs. Margaret E. Sangster\nlived In Norfolk, Va., In the early 60s\nshe made her first acquaintance with\na brick oven. In her book she tells an\namusing story of the presiding genius\nof her kitchen, Aunt Hannah, black as\nebony and straight as a post.\nAunt Hannah’s magnificent carriage\nof head and shoulders was the result\nof “toting” burdens on her head in\nchildhood and girlhood. Her boast\nwas that in her teens she could dance\nwith a pail of water on her head with\nout spilling a drop.\nHer corn bread, her white loaves,\nher roast and broiled meat could not\nbe surpassed. She would bake her\nbreakfast breads in a spider set on\nthe coals and nothing that I have\neaten sluoo baa had their dellcioua\nflavor.\nI Dr. Duval was not a man to desert old\n. friends for new.\n> Ever since he was a boy the Morgan\nplace had been a second home to him\n- and Mrs. Morgan and Carlotta his\nchums, advisers and confidents. He\n* could see Carlotta s rapt I\'ttlo face,\npalo. yet glowing like a white flower\n- under her tawny hair, and her odd\ni brown eyes with the light In them\nlike sunlight through water as she sat\n- listening to his tale of a baseball\n- game, on his entry into the medical\np college, of his first real case, of most\n. things which had ever happened to\nj him.\n1 And now In the turmoil or this trag\n, edy which he felt bad come to him be\ni had a sudden desire for the long, cool\nliving room down there with Mrs.\nj Morgan placidly sewing by the open\n, window and Carlotta leaning forward\nIn the old mahogany divan listening\nlntently to whatever he had to say,\n1 her face reflecting her interest.\n, For a grown man. Dr. Duval was\nI very boyishly homesick and heart\ni slclc. Gertrude Whitcomb parted from\nhim at the hotel with some Irritation.\nThe trip home had been dull. She had\n| exerted herself for a man so ad\nstracted that he had scarcely answer\n. ed. Still, she comforted herself. It\n[ because of his disappointment.\n, s^e really did not Imagine he had\nbeen so desperately devoted to her!\n, Dr- Duval at the same time was on\na car speeding out toward the rain\nbling cottage. It was almost like old\ntimes to be so welcomed and fussed\never and graciously forgiven for his\n’ winter’s desertion.\n"You are so busy with your work,\nwe understand,” Mrs. Morgan had said\n( as she got out his favorite preserves.\nAnd Carlotta, the wistfulness of\nwhose face waa hidden from him by\nits Joy in h*a presence, was like some\ngraceful white wraith in .he shadows\nof the big room.\n“I had forgotten,” he told her with\nthe privilege of life-long acquaintance,\n"how wonderfully pretty you were,\nCarlotta! What have you been doing\nwith yourself? You seem to shine.”\n“Don’t talk about me,” begged the girl,\nnervously. A great fear was hers lest,\nthis stupid, blundering man should\ndiscover it was her happiness Id see\ning him again that had transformed\nher. "Tell me of yourself, of what\nhas happened to yon this winter!”\nHe had come to tell them—selfishly\nto demand comfort for his wounds —\nyet he held his tongue.\nHe stayed late at the Morgans, and\nwhen he left he felt oddly contented\nand at peace for a man whose heart\nhad only that afternoon been broken.\nHe was surprised when next he saw\nMiss Whitcomb that he felt none of\nthe bitter resentment which had at\nfirst been his at her refusal. In some\nstrange way that fever had burned\nItself out as though a cool hand had\nbanished It utterly. He simply did\nnot care. She was Just as beautiful\nand fascinating as ever, but his ro\nmance had crashed that afternoon In\nthe foothills and he had no desire to\npick up the broken pieces. She was\ntoo glittering for comfort, and she had\nhurt his pride by her carelessness.\nNothing cures a man\'s devotion as\ndoes a stab at his pride. Besides,\nCarlotta\'s smile stayed in his memory.\nIt was not, as he argued to himself\nsome weeks later In a sort of horrified\ndismay, that he was fickle and a man\nof unstable affections—lt was simply\nthat he had been under a spell, luckily\nnow broken, and had gone back to\nwhere he belonged.\nHaving once found his welcome in\nthe rambling cottage, he found him\nself drawn there Irresistibly oftener\nthan In the years before. It was ab\nsence, he told himself, that had\nawakened him and shown him Car\nlotta’s real loveliness, her sweetness\nand womanly sympathy. And when,\nhalf tearfully, before the summer was\nover and when Gertrude Whitcomb\nwas only a vague memory, Dr. Duval\ntold Carlotta Morgan he loved her, he\nrealized he had always loved her and\nalways should.\n"I don\'t deserve anything so won\nderful,” he told her, "as that you\nshould care about me, Carlotta! I’ve\nbeen stupid in many ways—but I\'m in\nmy right mind now!"\n"I’ve always cared.” she told him\nsimply. For a moment she hesitated.\nThe previous winter, when he had\ndeserted the cottage, often troubled\nher. But with all her sweetness Car\nlotta Morgan had clever instincts.\nThat winter was past and he was\nhers now for always, and she was the\nrare woman who knows when not to\nquestion.\nThe night fragrance of roses floated\nin through the open, window as they\ntalked of the future In serene happi\nness. In the man\'s heart was a thank\nful and wondering content that things\nwere as they were, and in Carlotta’s\nnothing except that she loved him.\nShe had a meek little husband,\nwho fetched and carried for her as if\nhe had been a boy. although he was\nsome years her senior.\nWhen we moved from one house to\nanother, the distance not being very\ngreat, the family walked, and great\nwas my astonishment to behold Aunt\nHannah and I\'ncle Ed arriving in\nstate. In a carriage drawn by two\nhorses driven by a hackman of Im\npressive dignity.\nFeeling slightly disposed to resent\nthis display on her part, I inquired\nwhy she had chosen to drive when her\nmistress walked.\n"law, honey,” she said laughing\nuntil her whole frame shook, Tsq got\nde dinner to cook. I done thought all\nabout it, and I ’rived at de conclusion\ndat Ed and I better come dis away.\nYou can sit and fold yo\' hands.\n"Den, too," she went on, “I want\ndat cook next door to see me fust\ntime steppin\' out of a carriage.”—\nYouth\'s Companion.\n3---* 1 VvftWß n NESB.IT\n\\ Th#* pity in of brick and atone\nWith walls that touch the sky,\nHut there a man Is quite alone\nThough thousands pass him by;\nt Th. y breathe the breath of mill and mart\nWhere never dreaming Is;\n, He In their lives may have no part\n‘ And they have none In hla\ni It hammers him, the city’s day,\n° r binds him round with tape,\nUntil In Its relentless way\nl It molds him to a shape—\nI A shape that also shapes his soul\nI.lka those of all the rest,\nUnless he will not pay this toll\nAnd fares upon a quest\nI The country Is of grass and trees\nAnd cloud nnd sun and rain.\nOf singing birds and humming bees\nAnd winding road and lane.\nAnd grass that whispers all day long,\n, And orchards deep with shade—\nAh. there are story, laugh and song,\n1 Forever to be made.\nAnd he who passes is your friend\nThough ne’er again you meet:\nThe people do not blur and blend\nAs In a city street\n- Into a host of rushing forms\n\\ That either come or go.\nAnd If your soul has calms or storms\nThey neither care nor know.\nA garden first was given man\nIlm with his knowing frown\nHe sacrificed the primal plan\nAwl built himself a town.\nAnd ever through the city ways\nThere comes the luring dream\nOf starry mights and drowsing day*\nO\' meadowland and stream.\nChoosing a Watermelon.\nThe flavor of a watermelon depends\nlargely upon how you choose it.\nIf you select It over the telephone\nthrough the mediumship of a grocery\nclerk whose clairvoyance Is Imper\nfectly developed you will obtain a\nmelon which Is beautiful to gaze up\non externally but whose interior deco\nrations are unfinished.\nThere Is nothing so dispiriting in\nlife as to bisect a largo, emerald wa\ntermelon with a blonde area on Its\nsouthern exposure, and find the inside\nof It a discouraged pink streaked with\nwhite. Such a color scheme is fine\nfor a mother-of-pearl knife handle, but\nineffective for nutritive purposes.\nAnother unhappifying feature of a\nwatermelon Is to be compelled to eat\nit with a fork and not drop any of\nthe Juice on your napkin. Water\nmelons were never Intended by na\nture to be sliced geometrically and\neaten by means of a fork. They are\nnot in the pie class. For that matter,\nmany good authorities contend that\nthe use of a fork damages tho flavor\nof pie.\nPie and watermelon each should be\neaten by the same method. A con\nvenient wedge should be seized In\nthe hand, the back should be turned\nif necessary to avoid shocking on\nlookers, and then the delicacy should\nbo bitten off ad lib. The cbin may\nbe wiped dry with the handkerchief\nlater.\nTo choose a watermelon, go to a\nsmall town and wait on the main\nstreet until a freckled boy drives in\non a wagon load of the dainties.\nThump the largest one, and if it re\nspends with a solidly hollow plunk,\npay the boy his quarter, seek a se\ncluded Bpot, break the melon on a\nfence post and let nature take Its\ncourse.\nChanged Her Mind.\n"Do you wish to break our engage\nment?” he asked, bitterly.\n"I do; I feel that you do not ap\npreciate me as you should," she re- ,\nsponded.\n"Then I shall sue you for breach of\npromise, for a hundred thousand dol\nlars’ damages!”\nWith a cry of delight the fair 1\nyoung thing threw herself into his \'\narms. *\n"Forgive me, George,” she mur- ‘\nmured. “I was mistaken. If you\nthink my affection is worth that much\nto you, I am yours."\nWhat He Was.\n"Once I knew a man," said the In\nteresting conversationalist, “who was\njborn in mid ocean. His father was *\nan Englishman and his mother was \'\n•of French-Gorinan parentage, but was \'\na native of Greece. So what do you ‘\n\'suppose that man is?”\nS The listener thought steadily for ‘\n(some moments, but at last announced 1\nithat he could not guess.\n"He Is a dry goods merchant,” ex- \'\nplained the interesting conversation- 4\nalist.\n— . i\nNot Themselves. r\n, "Sir," said the angry customer to i\n\'the furniture mover, “those men you\njsent with the van to take my goods\nto my new home were drunk.”\n“Drunk?" asked the other. "Why,\n; I am surprised to hear such an ac- a\ncusation as that. What makes you, II\nj think they were?” b\n"They acted oddly.

Paper napkins will be\nfound to answer every purpose ahd\nare a great saving when laundry\nwork bust, be considered. As these\noutings are for special rest and\nhealth, care should be taken to pro\nvide only easily digested foods, es\npecially where there are children\nOlder people may indulge in fancy\ndishes and highly seasoned salads,\nhut the children should be spared. A\ncheap chafing dish Is a convenience\nIn which one may prepare a chipped\nbeef, creamed; creamed eggs or\nrarebit. These, with bread and but\ntor sandwiches, a simple salad and\ncoffee, make a pleasant first course.\nFruit alone may follow as dessert.\nSandwiches are In endless variety\nthese days. Chopped meat or fish\nrubbed to a paste with cream, butter\nor mayonnaise dressing and spread\non thin slices of either brown or\nwhite bread, make a nourishing,\nwholesome sandwich.\nSandfiches should be wrapped In\nwaxed paper. Salad sandwiches are\nnice only when fresh, as standing\nonly an hour will spoil their crisp\nness and make them unpalatable.\nFruits are always acceptable both as\nfood and drink. They quench the\nthirst and satisfy the hunger without\nadding burden to the body. The salts\nand acids they contain cool and thin\nthe blood.\nTomatoes are easily carried and\nserved on lettuce make a pleasant\naddition to a uieat sandwich.\nWater is the best, most wholesome\nand cheapest drink. Lemonade is a\ngreat favorite, but should be used\nsparingly If serving other fruit in\nquantity. The lemon Juice may be\nextracted and carried In a bottle.\nGnrden and porch parties differ\nfrom picnics In both arrangements\nand serving. The kitchen being with\nIn easy reach, dainty entrees, salads\nand Icea are possible to serve. One\nlarge table may bo arranged on the\nporch or under the trees or small\ntables may be scattered about.\nIf hot dishes are to be served the\npreparations may bo made early in\nthe day. Croquettes and cutlets may\nbe fried, placed £a a paper in the\noven and reheated In a few minutes\nin a hot oven.\nCold dishes like pressed chicken,\ndeviled tongue, or salads are to be\nchosen by those who wish to enter\ntain on small means and with Hm\nited help. Where wise forethought\nand planning are done forty persons\nmay be nicely served by a single\nmaid.\nSwedish Soup.\nTake equal quantities of prunes and\nraisins and cook very slowly in plenty\nof water until tender. Strain and\nsweeten and bind with a little cooked\nsago. Chill before serving.\nFrozen Pudding.\nScald one cup of milk, add one and\nc-ne half cupfuls of sugar, stir until\ndissolved. Mix a tablespoonful of\ncornstarch with a little cold milk,\nrook all together ten minutes, add a\nbeaten yolk of an egg, stir until well\ncooked, then add a pinch of salt, a 1\ntcaspoonful of vanilla, a cupful of\nsteamer raisins and a half cupful ol\nchopped nuts. When cold add a pint\nof cream and freeze. i\nBeach parties and basket picnics\nwill be the chief attraction for the\nnext two months.

Pipes have\nbeen discovered imbedded in the mor\ntar of churches built before Europe’#\nfirst acquaintance with tobacco, and It\nseems only reasonable to suppose that\nthe people of that day smoked herba of\nsome sort either medicinally or for\npleasure. Coltsfoot was Inhaled for\nasthma, though whether a pipe was\nused In the process remains a matter\nfor conjecture.\nMatches Not By-Products.\nIt is not to be assumed that, by rea- 1\nsou yf the smallness of matches, the\nmakers thereof over utilize scraps or\nbltß of wood left over. The contrary\nis the case. Matches are not by\nproducts. Any wood rejected by tho\nmatch machine goes to the by-product\nestablishment, and of these by\nproducts of the match business may\nbe mentioned some, such as doors and\nsashes, that In some instances form\nan Industry as important as the match\nindustry itself.\nAll She Wanted.\nSix-year-old Anna was going to have\na birthday party to which Wilbur, her\nlittle playmate, was Invited.

Thomas Parran, though he\nbad no opposition in the primaries\nhas not been idle and allow the grass\nto grow under his feet\nPresident Taft’s letter to Lloyd\nGrisrom n Monday contains solid\nfacts and meets the issues of the\ncoming Campaign square in the face.\nMr Taft is a quiet conservatire\nPresident who does things.\nThe coming convention of the\nNational Rivers and Harbors Con\ngress which will be held in\nthe city of Washington the week of\nDecember sth., promises to be the\nlargest gathering of waterway en\nthusissts ever held in this or any\nother country. With President Taft\nsounding the keynote for # compre\nhensive policy on the part of the\nFederal Government towards the\nrivers, harbors and canals of the\nNation, an earnest of what the Con\nvention will reflect in the way of\npublic sentiment on this great ques\ntion is disclosed. There will be\nnotable men and Capt. J. F. Ellison\nof Cincinnati, Secretary of the Con\ngress is already enthusiastic over the\nprospects. With the Federal Con\ngress in session ard the National\nRivers and Harbors Congress meet\ning simultaneously, the National\nCapital will be crowded with\nnotables, men and women who are\nmaking the improvement of the\nwaterways as mnph of a study as\nthe tariff, and the conservation of\nonr natural resources.\nDr. Crichton, the owner and driver\nof. the machine which closed the\ndeath of Mr. Alexander Howie, ap\npeared on Monday and gave bond\nfor his appearance at the November\nterm of Court.\nThe facts of this deplorable affair\nwere told in our last issue. The fact\nthat Dr. Crichton came down volun\ntary and gave bond does not in ihe\nleast lesson ;he terrible outrage that\nbe has committed against the people\nof Charles County. As told before\nthe most unhuman act of Dr Crich-■\nton and the others with him in re\nfusing to give any aid to the injured\nman until forced to do so cannot\nand will not- soon be forgotten by\nthe people ot this County.\nT.’-ir actions during the afternoon\nprevious to the killing of Mr. Howie,\nplainly demonstrated that these peo\nple thought they could run people in\nditches and fences as they pleased.\nAnd again, their final dash back\nhome when they disregarded human\nj -y calls for rightful indignation.\nThe people of Charles County do\nnot propose to put up with these\nreckless antomobilists running around\ndisregarding their rights.\nWe think and believe they will be\nrigorously prosecuted and a lesson\ntaught that will be heeded in the\nfuture. V\nThe rights of the people upon the\npublic highway must he respected,\nand our County, authorities should\nsee to it that these rights are not\njeopardize! by anyone regardless of\nthe consequence to the parties con\ncerned. The penitentiary is not one\nwhit too good for such transgressors\non the rights of our people, who\nseem to place such little value on\nhuman life.\nThey should be made too know\nand fully understand, that the killing\nof a human being in Charles County\nis something more than a passing\nincident of life.\nis taken by people in tropi\ncal countries all the year\nround. It stops wasting and\nkeeps up the strength and\nvitality in summer as well\nas winter.\nALL DRUGGISTS\nVv ANTED TO BlIV! ;\nSix well broken mares between t\' e\nages of four and seven.\nROBERT CRAIN,\nCooksey, P. o.\nFIRST DIRECT PRIMARIES.\n- The fiirst primary election held\n* where the voters cast their rotes\ndireetly for the man they desired as\nther party nominee in the fall took\nplace on Tuesday.\nThat this system oDvoting is more\npleasing and satisfactory to the voters\nthan the e!<i system of electing dele\ngates to a convention that named\nthe nominee goes without saying be\n* cause it eliminates the bosses and\nleaves the balance of power in hands\nof the people.\nIn this District there was only a\ncontest for the Democratic nomina\ntion for Congress.\nThe vote while not large shows |\nthat more interest was manifested\nthan is usually the case by the poople.\n= In this County a very small vote was\n\' cast but at the same time we believe\nalmost twice as many as would have \'\nbeen cast in t ie primaries under the\nConvention system. The only ohjec- j\ntion to the direct system of votii g\nin the primary is that it is rather\nexpensive, but we believe that by\ncareful prunning the law can be\namended and the system made ex\ncedingly satisfactory.\nThe people are in the saddle row (\n* and it is to them that the aspirants for\nN political business must submit his\nclaims. Of course the new primary\nj election system does not mean that\nj there will be no longer any party\norganizations. There will be politi\ncal party organizations rs long as\nthere are parties.\nThe result on Tuesday outside of\nthe question of politics was most\npleasing to the people who for the\nfirst time in years were able to name\nthe nominees for Congres* without\nthe crack of the “Bosses” whip.\nThe people can always ho trusted\nand any man who desires to be a\ncandidate need never be afraid to\ncome out before them and fnake his\nfight to secure the coveted honor.\nOne thing we might add and that\n\' is that the primary election on Tues-\nday in this county can be commend\ned because there were no trick bai-\nlots.\ne Sheriff’s Sale.\nBy a virtue of a writ of Fieri Facias ■\nissued out of the Circuit Court for;\n9 Charles County at the suit of Southern ;\n.

My\nbody and face were covered with\nsores. One day it would seem to be\nbetter, and then break out again with\nthe most terrible pain and Itching. I\nhave been sick several times, but\nnever in my life did I experience such\nawful suffering a9 with this eczema. I\nhad made up my mind that death was\nnear at hand, and I longed for that\ntime when I would be at rest I had\ntried many different doctors and medi\ncines without success, and my mother\nbrought me the Cuticura Remedies, in\nsisting that I try them. I began to\nfeel better after the first bath with\nCuticura Soap, and one application of\nCuticura Ointment.\n“I continued with the Cuticura Soap\nand Cuticura Ointment, and have\ntaken four bottles of Cuticura Resolv\nent, and consider myself well. This\nwas nine years ago and I have had\nno return of the trouble since. Any\nperson having any doubt about this\nwonderful cure by the Cuticura Reme\ndies can write to my address.
