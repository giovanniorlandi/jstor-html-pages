A movement has been\nstarted with a view to watching\nthe Educational Interests during\nthe period that the New State is\nforming. Statistics are being col\nlected with the aim of showing the\nactual conditions and needs of the\nsehools now organized. No state\nhas ever been formed under so\nmany educational disadvantages as\nnow sunoun.1 the Indian Territory.\nStatehood will not renove all of\nthese unfortunate conditions.\nThe power of taxation has been\nimpossible to obtain the necessary\nfunds to run schools. Take for\nexample the city of Chickasha with\nits two thoussnd school children.\nIn the brief space of five years this\ncity has passed from a mere village\nto a metropolis of fifteen thousand\ninhabitants. Prior to the present\nyears not cent of tax could be col3\nlected from the real estate with.n\nthe corporate limits. Railroads\nhave managed to avoid all taxes.\nMen worth thousands of dollars\nhave resided within the city while\ntheir personal property, the only\nsource ot revenue, has been locded\nbeyond the reach of the tax c ji\nlecter. Others move their famill.es\nfrom their farms or ranches each\nfall iu order to place their children\nin school. Thus the number o:\npupils to be cared for, fcas been\nincreased while the reveauces hsve\nremained the same. t are as a\nmatter of corse glad that children\ncome.\n(Continued on pare 3)\nT5W fv 4 tf -\nLittle Giant School shoes, solid\nI wear, fine workmanship.

NOVEMBER 9. 95\nSIDEWALKS ANOTHER \'PLAN\nThe improvement district method of building\nsidewalks is meeting with opposition among some\n" who are really anxious to see sidewalks built. Men\nlike A. S. Giikey and E.B. Biidges, who are among\nour progressive citizens and are strongly in favor of\nstreet improvements, have serious objections to the\nimprovement district plan,\nThe F.xpress believes this plan is a feasible and\nequitable one, even though it may involve some\nisolated cases of inequality in the burdens imposed\non the tax payer. Nevertheless, the idea., of the\ngentlemen w ho think otherwise are worth considering.\nWe don t refer now to the "antis" who oppose any\nkind of improvement and are for delay, but to those\nwho are really eager for progress in this direction,\nMY. Bridges believes that the desired improv\nmen\'.s cn be made byjvoluntary eSort. By personal\nsolicitation, he thinks voluntary agreement to put\ndow n walks can besecured among the property owners\nin each block. When a man is certain that his\nneighbor is going to build a walk, and his neighbor\'s\nneighbor etc, he will be willing to build his own\nwalk and the fellow who holds back will be forced by\npublic sentiment to do his duty.\nd by the commercial club!\' A j T K7T J 4\nplish the result.

No doubt it could be carried out if\n.sufiiicieut interest on the subject could be aroused\namong the people. The phn requires a considerable\nnumber of energetic public spirited workers, wi:o\nwill give their time to working up the agreements\namong the property owners. Who are the worke.s\nwho w ill do this? There should be plenty of volun\nteers to sacrifice their time for such a cause, but will\nthey do it? The civic improvement associations that I\nhave been recommended by the commercial clu\nmight effictively accompli\ncerted movement among\nble to have walks all ov\nhave an nd to the matter. Who are the apostles of\ncivic decency and progress who will lead in thecrusadt?\nIt is true that the street crossing difficulty bobs\nup here. Who will build the crossings? The city is\npoor and cau\'t afford it. A monstrous obstacle in\ndeed, but not insuperable the city can help some\nand the property owners in each block can :\'chip in"\na mite each and the crossings will be built. A sub\nstantial crosiing can be built for $12. and the best\nwill cost about $20.\nNow if you want sidewalks and don\'t want im\nprovement districts, it is up to you to get busy among\nyour neighbors, build your own walk and see that\nothers do the 3; rre. Lets quit magnifying the\ndifficulties and begin to study the methods by which\nwalks CANbe built.\n0-0-0\nLes than 20,000 voters out of 150,000 in Indian\nTerritory voted on the Sequoyah constitution.

YOURS TRULY,\nI\n4-\nIn all other territories openedjto\nsettlement Congress bs some pro\nvisious for t!e training of the fnture\ncitizenship. Without buildings,\nfupplies furniture, in fact without\nany thing and with out no means\nto raise money with which to buy,\nit is indeed wonderful how much\nhas beeii done. The terms of\nschool have form necessity been\nshort. In many instances children\nhave been entirely with otft school\nprivileges. Teachers have been\nunder paid which always results in\nmore or \'ess inefficency. The\nUnited Siaies furnishes noexamp.e\nof such a great ceed of good schools\nCongress has recognized this con\nditions and has granted aid that\nhas been applied to the building\nup of rural school. f\nWhy to rural school? It would\nseem that a child in the city is as\nmnch to his goverment as a child\nin the country.\nThe great, natural resources of\nthe Indian Territory will bring to\nthe uew state an unparalleled rush\nof settlers. School directors who\nhave figured on a certain cost for\na school years will find that the\nincrease in school children will al\nmost double their estimate. Every\ngateway to the new state of Okla\nhoma should be open wide. Let\nall desiroble citizens come. The\nduty to prepare lies heavily on the\npresent citizenship of the Indian\ni Territory.\nThe new state must organize\nschools. The children are entitled\nto the best, system. With peopie\nfrom all of the old states to aid in\nthis matter we can easily incorpor\nate into the school the results of\nyears of experienc. Activity is\nneeded. The transition period is\nof vast importance. Every thing\n! shauld be so carefully planned that\nmistakes will be impossible. Such\nis the task that the Iudian Territory\nEducational Association has taken\nupon itself. The Association needs\nthe best intellect of the Territory.\nIts membership is largely teachers\nbut no one is excluded. All who\ni feel iuterest in this matter are in\nvited to lend their aid.\nThe first step in the work is the\ncollection of statisticts. Blanks\nhave been sent to each school in\nthe Territory. These blanks were\nprepared with a view of showing\nthe\'actual conditions and needs of\nthe schools. If from any cause a\nsingle school has been overlooked\nthe teacher should at once make\napplication to the writer for blanks\nAll of theee blanks should be filled\nout and sent to the secretary of the\nassociation, Supt. J. G. Master,\nWilburton, I. T. before the meet\nng of the 1 8th. The time is short\nYet the work can be properly done\nA little time, a few postage stamps\nlittle railroad fair should not be\npermitted to interfere with this\ncritical period. The last meeting\nof the Association was all that\nany one could expect. A repre\nsentative from each school in the\nIndian Territory should be at\nSouth McLaster on the i8th.\nWynne S.
