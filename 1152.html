The negro became infuri\nated, and, drawing a revolver, fired at\nhis annoyers. He then made a hasty\nflight.\nTO WAGE WAR ON SALOONS.\nMovement Started in Atlanta for a\nGeorgia Prohibition Campaign,\nThe first step toward a prohibition\ncampaign in Georgia was taken by\nthe Atlanta Anti-Saloon League by\nthe adoption Tuesday niGht of resolu\ntions expressive of euoh a purposa.\ncopies of which are to be sent to\nevery church In the city of Atlanta\nwith the request that the congreg*\nUons either adopt or reject them.\nHUGHES DECLINES HONOR\nThinks Acceptance of New York May\noralty Nomination Would "Queer"\nInsurance Investigation.\nCharles Hughes, counsel for the In\nsurance investigating committee, has\ndeclined the republican nomination\nfor mayor of New York city.\nIn slating his grounds fo,r refusing\nthe nomination, Mr. Hughes said:\n"In this dilemma 1 have simply to\ndo my duty as I see It. In my judg\nment I have no right to accept the\nnomination. A paramount public duty\nforbids it.\n-ft is not necessary to enlarge\nupon the importance of the insurance\ninvestigation. This is undisputed. It\nis dealing with questions vital to the\ninterests of millions of our fellow cit\nizens throughout the land. It presents\nan opportunity for public service sec\nond to none and involves a co-rela\ntive responsibility. This work com\nmands all my energies. It is imper-,\native that I continue it.\n"The non-political character of the\ninvestigation and its freedom from\nbias either of fear or favor, not only\nmust exist, they must be recognized.\n“Were I, with the best of inten\ntions, to accept, the nomination, it is\nmy conviction that the work of the\ninvestigation would he largely dis\ncredited by the public at large; its mo\ntives would be ifnpugnert and its in\ntegrity assailed. To many it would\nappear that its course would be\nshaped and its lines of inquiry would\nbe chosen, developed or abandoned as\nlunhitinn misrht. nromnt or\npolitical exigency demand.\n“Such a situation would be intoler\nable. There is but one course open.\nThe legislative inquiry must proceed\nwith convincing disinterestedness. Its\ngreat opportunities must not be imj\nperilled by alienating the support to\nwhich it Is entitled, or by giving the\nslightest occasion for questioning the\nsincerity and single-mindedness with\nwhich it is conducted.\n“For your expression of confidence\nI thank you. The honor you would\nconfer upon me I most heartily es\n:eem. Yo.ir most generous approval\nand the unanimity and enthusiasm\nwith which the nomination was made,\nI warmly appreciate. But I have as\nsumed obligations of the first import\nante, which make it impossible for\nme to meet your wishes. I must,\ntherefore, respectfully decline the\nnomination.”\nFUGITIVES BEHIND BARS,\nGreene and Gaynor Ensconced in Sa.\nvannah Jail—Wives Greeted Them\non Arrival In the City.\nThe welcome of their wives await\ned Benjamin D. Greene and John F.\nGaynor when in the custody of a\nquartet of officers, they arrived in Sa\nvannah at 6 o\'clock Monday morning\nat the union station after their long\njourney from Montreal.\nAn affectionate greeting was ex\nchanged between the alleged conspir\nators and their wives. After a brief\ninterchange the prisoners and Mar\nshals White and Boyle left in one\ncarriage for the Chatham county jail,\nwhile the ladies took another for the\n* BeSoto hotel, where they are stopping!\nThe prisoners were not handcuffed.\nArriving at the jail, the party had\nsome trouble “breaking in.” Greene\nand Gaynor commented upon this ap\nparent difficulty. Finally the marshals\nwere able to make the custodians\nwithin hear and the gates were open\npri tn plnsp lnfpr fn onnfinp fJrppnp\nand Gaynor.\nThe prisoners were installed In a\nspecial room on the top floor. They\nwill furnish it comfortably, and every\nmorning a negro barber is to appear\nto shave them. Atrangements have\nbeen made for them to receive their\nmeals from the DeSoto. Many callers\nappeared at the jail. Among them\nwas P. W. Meldrim of Garrard & Mel\ndrim, attorneys, who have been en\ngaged by the prisoners. Colonel Mel\ndrim gave them instructions not to\ntalk, and efforts to secure interviews\nwere bootless. It is said that an at\ntempt to obtain their liberty on bail\nwill be made.\nFEVER FIGHT ABOUT OVER.\nWarfare on Mosquitoes at New Or.\nleans is Brought to an End.\nThe announcements by the marine\nhospital service that the work of fight\ning mosquitoes in New Orleans in\nwhich the forces of the government\nhave been engaged since August 8,\nas well as the fumigation of squares\nin which a case of fever appears, will\nbe discontinued, is accepted as a dec\nlaration by the federal forces that the\nfight against the fever is about over,\nand that there will be a steady de\ncline of it until it finally disappears\nwith frost, if indeed it is not wiped\nout somewhat earlier.\nNOVEMBER COTTON REPORT.\nSecretary Wilson Announces Decided\nDeparture from Custom.\nSecretary Wilson announces that a\nNovember cotton report will be issued\nby the department of agriculture,\nprobably early in the month, but the\nexact date has not been decided.\nThis is a departure from the cus\ntom of the department, no reports\nhaving been issued in the month of\nNovember heretofore. ^\nADIEU TO CANADA\nGreene and Gaynor Bid Fare\nwell to Dominion Friends,\nJOURNEY TO THE SOUTH\nLong and Bitter Legal Fight Against\nExtradition Ended in Victory for\nGovernment _ Gaynor Ex\npresses Pleasure on Return.\n— - "7\nThe last chapter as far as Canada\nis concerned in the celebrated Gaynor\nand Green case, was closed Saturday\nwhen the two men left the Bonaven\nture station of the Grand Trunk rail\nway at Montreal on a Delaware and\nHtudson train at 8:40 a. m.\nA large crowd of people was pres\nent to see them off, but the most nota\nble thing about the departure was the\nlarge number of secret service men\nwho were around.

The prisoners went into the\nsmoking comparment with Chief Car\npenter, Chief Flynn and Messrs. Boyd\nand White.\nWhen asked if they had anything to\nsay before leaving Colonel Gaynor re\nplied that they were glad to go back\nat last and that they would have\nnothing but the kindest remembrances\nof their treatment in Canada. Colonel\nGaynor’s daughter-in-law was on board\nthe train when the j^isoners arrived,\nand his son arrived at the station\njust before the train left.\nLeft New York at Midnight.\nThe prisoners arrived in New York\nfrom Montreal at 8 o’clock Saturday\nnight. They were taken at once to the\nPennsylvania depot. The party left\nfor Savannah at midnight.\nGaynor was permitted by his\nguards to shake hands with L». Kaf\nlin Kellogg, who defended the prison\ners before Commissioner Shields and\nrepresented Captain Carter at the\ncourtmartial which resulted in the lat\nter’s conviction. Gaynor was over\nheard to say\'that he wished they had\nfollowed Kellogg’s advice. Mr. Kel\nlogg afterwards explained that he had\nadvised his clients to stand their\nground and warned them that flight\nmight be taken as an admission ol\nguilt.\nThe party passed through Wash\nington Sunday.

The\nend came peacefully, and his spirit\nwinged away like a gentle zephyr to\nrealms beyond shining planets, to\nhis eternal home in his Father’s\nmansion, where He had prepared a\nplace for his coming.\nIn his last days and hours, when\nthe separation of soul and body and\nthe beautiful transformation was\nAnally consummated, his devoted\nwife, dutiful daughters, affectionate\ngrandchildren, tenderly loved sister,\nrelatives and friends were gathered\naround his dying couch to witness\nthe dispensations and teachings of a\ngreat, true and just God.\nThe deceased was born in the State\nof North Carolina oil December the\n18th, in the year 1818, and. would\nhave reached his 87th year in De\ncember—a full, ripe age of four-score\nand seven. His father moved to\nMississippi when the deceased was\nin his boyhood, and settled at Wa\nhnlak as one of the pioneers of this\ncountry, and lived to see "Wahalak\nbuild up to be One of the most flour\nishing towns in East Mississippi—\nwith schools, churches, commerce,\nbanks, filled with the best of citi\nzens, and a fine surrounding coun\ntry. Here bis father died iir his\nyoung manhood days.\nAfter the Mobile & Ohio Railroad\nwas built, the town of Wahalak was\nabsorbed by Seooba, Macon, and j\nGainesville, Ala, He then moved\nto Seooba, one of its first settlers,\nand engaged in the, mercantile busi\nness, in which pursuit lie continued\nuiiiii iii.s u^aui.\nIn 18t!0 he was married to Mrs. Is\nabelle Annie Stewart (nee Adams).\nIn this union were given two chil\ndren—Mrs. (Rev.)

J. \\V. Moseley, of\nOka Iona, his former pastor, in the\nPresbyterian Church; his remains\nwere interred in Scooba cemetery,\nattended by a large concourse of\nweeping relatives and sympathizing\nfriends, to rest until the awakening\nreveille shall be sounded in the\ngreat morn of the resurrection, when\nthe grave shall give up its dead, the\nweary will be at rest, and the just\nbe made perfect.

When discovered, the fire had\ngained such headway and was burn\ning so fiercely, that the most import\nant thing apparent to the guests of\nthe hotel was the salvation of them\nselves and their valuables.\nProbably the majority of the pop\nulation of the town gathered in the\nvicinity of the fire, prepared to pre\nvent the spread ot the names to\nother buildings. Fortunately, the\nstructure was comparatively isola\nted, it was a calm, still night, and\nthere was no occasion for exertion\nin this particular.\nMrs. F. L.

This phenom\nenal prosperity abounds in store,work\nshbp, mine, factory and in the con\nstruction and improvement of rail\nways. Not one discordant note is heard\non prosperity\'s lute in the land of\ncotton and magnolia blossoms. Farm\ners are blessed with bountiful crops,\nfor which they are receiving magnifi\ncent prices. The cotton manufacturer\n’finds himself put to a strong test to\nfill the orders for goods he has from\nboth foreign and domestic buyers, and\nrailways are busy constructing new\nlines to new industrial centers spring\ning into being day by day.\nBut the greatest evidence of pros\nperity at the south is to be found\nin cotton milling and the manufacture\nof furniture. In the past fifteen years\ncotton mills and furniture factories\nhave sprung into being a!l over the\nsouth, especially in the states of Ala\nbama, Georgia, North Carolina. South\nCarolina and Virginia, and this good\nyear ISO-5 finds them working over\ntime to meet the demands for their\nproducts. These cotton mills and fur\nniture factories draw on the fields and\nforests of all the states of the south\nfor their raw material. The railroads\nare assisting them very materially in\ntheir strides toward making the south\na manufacturing empire by a most lib\neral policy in the matter of freight\nrates, both on raw materials and man\nufactured produe\'s.\nThe cotton mills of New England\nhave hitherto had a monopoly of cot\nton manufactures in this country. The\nadvantages enjoyed by that section in\nwater transporta\'ion. which guaran\nteed to eastern spinners very cheap\nfreight, has in the past enabled van\nkeedotn to maintain a complete mo\nnopoly in cotton milling. It is differ\nent, far different, today, however. The\ngreat, railway systems penetrating the\nsouth, the heme of raw cotton and\nviig\'n forests concluded to aid strug\ngling manufacturers in the south and\nbuild up cotton milling and other man\nufacturing in that section. They re\nduced the freight on raw materials to\nthe mills and factories, and on the\nmanufactured products from the mills\nnrd factories to the markets of the\ncast and wes‘, which reduction plac\ned the southern mill men and manu\nfacturers on an equal footing with the\nrotten mills of New Ehgland and the\nfurniture manufacturers of the west,\nso today the southern mill men and\nmanufacturers are enabled to market\ntheir products at tfle very doors of\nthe eastern an | western manufactur\ners in competition with them.\nAs before stated, this liberal policy\nin the matter of freight rates on the\npart cf the railways leading to the\nsouth has been the chief means of\nbuilding up her manufacturing indus\ntries. the real cause of her present un\nbounded prosperity ar.d the southern\ni conic owe a debt of gratitude to these\nland transportation companies they\nwill never he able to repay in full.\nWashing Sent From India.\nM.

The answer\nWOW to (his question is a logi\ncal 011c. The policy of the Government\nshould ho to so use the funds placed\nat Its disposal by the people for na\ntional purposes and to so shape its fis\ncal and other legislation as to promote\nthe best interests of the people. It is\nhardly susceptible of controversy that\nthe tiling which will do most to pro\nmote the further prosperity and de\nvelopment of tiic country is a system\nof improved highways reaching out\ninto tire farming districts. As 1ms\nbeen wisely said, city development\nwill take care of itself. Indeed, it lias\ngone on in the past at the expense of\nrural development principally because\nthe groat burden upon agricultural\ncommunities of wretched public roads\nhas kept back agricultural develop\nment. The Government lias recog\nnized its obligation to aid in further\ning means of transportation by the\niieip it has extended to railway nml\nwater facilities. The improvement of\nl our highways will nteau the rounding\nI out of transput ration facilities in the\ncountry, the giving to remote districts\nadequate means of reaching markets\nand distributing centres, and perform\nthe Anal work in national progress\nand prosperity. These are some of\nthe reasons why the Federal Govern\nment should and is improving the\nhighways. The Brownlcfw-Latimer\nbilis, in House and Senate, point the\nway to most happy national results,\nj Senator Latimer epitomizes some rea\nsons why tlie Government should rec\nognize its obligation in the matter\nwhich we think well worth reproduc\ntion. They are:\nFirst. Because the history of road\nbuilding demonstrates that a complete\nsystem of public roads has never been\nconstructed in any country except by\nthe aid of the General Government of\nthat country, and during the 100\nX- _ . 1 Hi- It. ~ TT« t 4- .-wl\ny tills Ul UUl UCIUUUUI 11U,\nStates lias not proven an exception to\nthis rule.\nSecond. Because the revenues of\nthe Government are raised, largely\nupon articles consumed by all the\npeople, thereby distributing taxation\nequally, and as nil the people should\n: contribute to the construction and im\nprovement of the roads, it Is only by\nFederal aid that this can be accom\n.plished.\nThird. Because it is the duty of the\nFederal Government to bear its just\nproportion of the expense for the con\nstruction and -improvement of the\nroads which it uses for the delivery of\nthe mails and for military purposes in\ntime of war, and which are the arter\nies of interstate commerce.\nFourth. Because better roads are a\nnational necessity; they closely con\ncern the general welfare of the nation,\nand are therefore a proper object of\nnational aid.\nFifth. Because the money in the\nnational treasury belongs to the peo\nple and should be expended for their\nbenefit in a manner which will accom\nplish the greatest good to the largest\nnumber, and because the power to\nborrow money at low rates of interest,\nif it be found necessary to supply the\nmoney iu this way, enables the Gen\neral Government to undertake this im\nprovement with greater advantage\nthan the States or the people.\nIn .the foregoing statement we have\nthe proposition for national aid boiled\ndown to the practical point of clear\nunderstanding.\nLegs Expensive Eo»(lg.\nThe town boards of Oneida County,\n.V. Y., made the following suggestion:\n‘■\\Ye would not recommend that every\ntown in this county have built within\nits borders a road costing on the aver\nage $7000 a mile, as we believe each\ntown should govern itself according to\nits own local conditions, but we have\nprovided figures to show that no mat\nter whether a town lias a high or a low\noccoc.ua,1 valuation it could under the\n$50,000,000 bond issue, if its own board\nso desired, have, without excessive\ntaxation, just as wide and just as ex\npensive roads as any other town in any\nother part of the State. If the county\nand town can devise methods by which\nthe roads to be built should have an\naverage cost of $4000 a mile instead of\n$8000 a mile, the charge to the town\nunder the bond issue for each mile of\nhighway built would be $30 for each\nmile the first year; and to the county,\nthe increase in tax the first year for\neach mile of highway would be $70,\nand to tbe State it would be $100. In\nother words, under me $50,000,00(1\nbond issue the State, county and town\ncould obtain a road costing $4000 a\nmile at an increase in their annual tax\nlevy of $200, which under the present\nsystem of payment would call for the\nexpenditure of $4000 in cash, or undci\nthe bond issue they could obtain a road\ncosting $8000 a mile for an increase in\ntheir tax levies of $400 in place of rais\ning $8000 in cash, as provided by the\npresent method.\n“Under the bond issue each town and\ncounty is free to select as expensive a\nroad or as cheap a road as the local\nconditions require.”—Tribune Farmer.\nA Cure For Anything.\nDr. William Osier, in one of his Ban\ntimore lectures, recited a quaint old\ncure for the gout—a cure, from a sev\nenteenth century medical work, tha\'\nwas designed to show gout’s hopeless\nness.\n“First pick,” said this odd cure, “t\nhandkerchief from the pocket of £\nspinster of thirty-five who nevei\nwished to wed; second, wash the hand\nkerchief in an honest miller’s pond\nthird, dry it on the hedge of a parsor\nwho never was covetous; fourth, send\nit to the shop of a physician who nevei\nkilled a patient; fifth, mark it with f\nlawyer’s ink who never cheated f\nclient, and, sixth, apply It hot to tin\ngfWt-tomeuted part.

It made them grow\ntwice os fast as similar plants that had only the Sun\nlight of day-lime, viz., half the time.\nThat was proven by Cornell University 111 a three\nmonths’ experiment made this very year.\n* * *\nNow, I’ve saved up for the last a point more im\nportant to you than all the others about Acetylene\nIt consumes only one-fourtli as much of the vital\nOxygen from the Air of Living rooms or bed-rooms,\nas either Kerosene or City Gas-Light consumes.\nThat’s a tremendous difference in a lifetime, mark\nyou—three-fourths of a difference.\nBecause,—Oxygen is Life.\nAnd every bit of Oxygen stolen from the lungs ot\nWomen, Children and Men, through Lighting, is a\nloss that can never be made good again.\nA 24 Candle-Power Acetylene Light costs you only\ntwo-fifths of a cent per hour. . •\nThat’s about $585 per year, if burned every night\nin the vear for four steady hours.\nA Kerosene Lamp, of equal capacity would cost you\na third more, viz.: three-fifths of a cent per hour for\nKerosene alone, or $8.75 per year.\nThat’s exclusive of broken lamp chimneys, new\nwick\'s, and the everlasting drudgery and danger of\ncleaning, filling and trimming daily.\nI want to prove these figures to you, Reader, it you\nare a house-owner or storekeeper.\nTell me how many rooms you ve got and 111 tell you\nwhat it will cost to light them with brilliant, beautiful,\nSanitary, eye-saving Acetylene.\nWrite me today for my Free Book about Sunlight\non Tap.”\nJust address me here as—\n“Acetylene Jones,\n* 9 Adams St.,\n4 Chicago, Ills.\niHv date ’em i„\nWhen you buy a pair of\niTMV CLOVER 1\nAouslmifs f mn A MF|\nJ§ “GROWING 1/ DSUXPIU\nAlf FASTEST OTY/\\f^C\nM WITHOUT / Qff f|F %\nmm A.
