These eggs hatch in from\no 12 days after being deposited and\nhe poison should be on the foliage\ni/nd fruit at the time the worms\nlatch. Tlie date of applying the third\n>pray In the higher altitudes should\n>e delayed a few days longer, owing\no the fact that the eggs are de\nposited a little later.\n"The above dates have been set\nfrom the results of work with field\njages planted in different orchards\nmd Into which the cocooned larvae\nif the codling moth were placed as\nsoon as they had left the apple and\npun their webs, or cocoons, under\nthe rough bark of the tree trunk\nand under bands placed on the trunks\njf the trees to trap the worms.\nMoths have been issuing for several\nlays in these screen cages, which\niav« been kept under observation of\nthe department of horticultural in\nipeeUon; and these moth will soon\nie depositing eggs for another gener\nation. This la the only accurate\nmethod by which the time for ap\nplying the third spray con he guag\ned, and is one which iti would pay\nevery fruitgrower to put Into prac\ntice.\n"Every grower can put on the first\nspray at the right time, which ie just\nafter the petals fall. Likewise the\nsecond spray, usually made three\nweeks later, is applied at the right\ntime, although many fruitgrowers in\nthe Boise valley applied this spray\ntoo late this year. The third spray\ns often applied too soon or too lute\nlie cause of no accurate guide, and is\nsometimes delayed on account of a\nrush of other work on the farm.\nThis is the spray that has so often\nbeen applied at the wrong time and\nwhich means much to the grower, as\nit prevents Injury to the apples In\nAugust and September, thereby pre\nventing a serious loss to a fruit crop\nJust wheu the orclmrd\'st thinks\ntils apples are coming through in first\ni.iass condition.\n"In many sections last year large\nnumbers of appleB were thrown out\nat packing time because of the pres\nence of \'side worms\' or bhuvsnes\nWhich showed up late In tho season.\nThe question of how to overcome\nthis loss was one frequently brougnl\nup In the farmers\' movable schools\nand institutes held last winter by the\nagricultural extension department cf\nthe University of Idaho.
