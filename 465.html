This aspectual, “additative” anthropology constitutes the common \nbackground for the distinctive emphasis on certain aspects of the human condition that one \nfinds in various OT documents, e.g., the P and “non-P” materials in Genesis 1–11. It also \nserves as a potential antidote to the anthropological reductionism/one-sidedness of many \nmodern and contemporary systems of anthropology.—C.T.B.\n1106. James w. watts, “From the Ark of the Covenant to Torah Scroll: Ritualizing \n Israel’s Iconic Texts,” Ritual Innovation, 21-34 [see #1185].\nW.’s article addresses the disappearance of the ark of the covenant, and notes the emergence\nof metaphorical and spiritual replacements for this. In contrast to R. Achenbach (see \n#1091), however, W. insists that there was also a physical replacement for the ark: the Torah \nscrolls. It is for this reason that the postexilic Priestly source can speak of the making of the \nark even though there was no ark in the Second Temple. The Pentateuch’s ark contained \ntexts, the stone tablets, but these are frequently conflated with Torah scrolls, such that readers \nare apt to equate them, or at least think of them in similar ways. Nevertheless, as W. seeks \nto demonstrate, the two categories of texts functioned quite differently. Both kinds of texts \nwere venerated as holy objects. But while the stone tablets were concealed in the ark, which \nfunctioned like a reliquary, the Torah scrolls were read publicly before the people. Thus, \nalongside the processes of spiritualization and abstraction Achenbach identifies, we may also \ndiscern a shift from the esoteric to the exoteric.

Brooke, “The Place of Wisdom in the Formation of the Movement\nbehind the Dead Sea Scrolls,” Goochem in Mokum, 20-33 [see #1175].\nThe sectarian literature of the Dead Sea Scrolls shows conceptual connections and \nindebtedness to the pre-sectarian wisdom writings. Three wisdom motifs that are picked up \nand developed in the more sectarian understanding are the rz nhyh phrase, the “poor,” and \nthe Maskil. In particular the author of the Hodayot understands himself to be the Maskil \nwho embodies the “mystery” and is the paradigmatic “poor one.” If this poet is to be \nidentified with the Teacher of Righteousness, this would further suggest that the sectarian\nmovement may have drawn a significant portion of its members from scribal wisdom \nschools.—B.C.G.\n1108. [DSS] Bronson Brown-Devost, “Scripta Qumranica Electronica (2016–2021),” \nHeBAI 5 (2016) 307-15.\nIn this contribution, the author describes an ambitious new undertaking in the digital \nhumanities called the Scripta Qumranica Electronica (SQE). As a model of cooperation \namong German and Israelite scholars and institutions, as well as among Qumran scholars \nand computer scientists, the project will not only generate digital editions of significant \nQumran texts, but will also produce new tools and techniques that will make new kinds of \nanalysis and comparison of texts possible, thereby enabling forms of scholarly inquiry that \n', '346 OLD TESTAMENT ABSTRACTS Vol. 40, 2017\nwould be difficult or impossible without these resources. Although the project is limited to \nQumran texts, this type of web-based digital resource is a model for what might be fruitfully\ndeveloped for apocalyptic literature more generally, especially for the study of the \ncomplex manuscript traditions of many of the texts in question. Against this background, it \nseems likely that both technical innovations and new ways of thinking about the contexts \nof apocalyptic literature will continue to transform our understanding of apocalyptic for the \nforeseeable future.

CD 6:21 and CD 14:3-6 treat the gēr \nas an insider and a worthy participant in the session of “the Many” (so CD 14:3-6)—albeit \nas a member at the lower end of the communal hierarchy. A. argues that CD’s patent openness\ntoward the gēr is derived from the work’s scriptural interpretation, which integrates \ntwo Levitical love commands (Lev 19:18, 34) and Deut. 24:14 into a single unit. While Lev \n19:34 commands love for the gēr, calling for his fair and amicable treatment, he is still set \napart from the “true” insiders, namely the Israelites. CD, however, radically narrows the distance\nbetween the gēr and the (Israelite) neighbor by recasting the gēr as a genuine insider \nwho is to be loved and cared for as a brother.

Collins, “Introduction: What Have We Learned from the Dead Sea \nScrolls?” Scriptures & Sectarianism, 1-16 [see #1287].\nThe extraordinary historical importance of the Scrolls lies in the fact that they provide\na previously unknown corpus of literature in Hebrew or Aramaic from Judea in the \nperiod between the Maccabees and the Mishnah. They fill out our knowledge of Judaism \nin this period in countless ways. Despite the sectarian ideology of much of the corpus, it \nalso includes much material that is reflective of common Judaism of the time. Much of the \ndebate about the Essene hypothesis has been fueled by conflicting desires to see the Scrolls \nas marginal or negligible, on the one hand, or as representative of mainline Judaism on the \nother. Neither of these categorizations can be sustained in isolation. The sectarian movement\nreflected in the Scrolls was marginal, insofar as it was a movement that died out and \nhad no discernible influence on later Jewish tradition. But it was not completely isolated, \nand the writings found in the caves are illuminating in many ways for the Judaism of the \ntime. As scholars have increasingly recognized in the last quarter century, the Scrolls are \ndocuments of ancient Judaism. Despite sensationalist claims, they are not Christian, and \ndo not witness directly to Jesus of Nazareth and his followers. Nonetheless, they illuminate \nthe context in which Jesus lived, and in which earliest Christianity took shape. While the \nScrolls sometimes provide parallels to particular ideas in the NT, more often they provide \na foil. The ways of the Teacher of Righteousness and of Jesus were alternative paths in the \ncontext of ancient Judaism, different ways in which the Jewish tradition might be appropriated\nand different interpretations of its scriptures.

Collins, “Covenant and Dualism in the Dead Sea \nScrolls,” Scriptures & Sectarianism, 179-94 [see #1287].\nIn much of ancient Judaism, as exemplified by Deuteronomy and the Damascus \nDocument, the core notion of God’s covenant with Israel presupposes the freedom of those \n', ' ARTICLES/Intertestamental, Apocrypha, NT Use: Qumran 347\nwho belong to that covenant to abide or not abide by its terms with the respective consequences\nof reward or punishment for their doing so. In some manuscripts of the Qum-\nranic Community Rule, however, one finds juxtaposed a ritual for entry into the covenant \nwith the so-called Instruction on the Two Spirits, which represents humans’ actions as \ndetermined by either a good or evil spirit, this ultimately negating the freedom of those \nwho enter the community’s covenant to choose for or against the covenant’s requirements. \nNonetheless, the document, under the ongoing influence of Israel’s wider covenantal tradition,\ncontinues to maintain that the (pre-determined) actions of those who either adhere \nor do not adhere to the covenant’s stipulations make them, respectively, liable to divine \nreward or punishment.—C.T.B.\n1112.

The History\nof Scholarship on Qumran Manuscript 4Q158,” Formation of the Pentateuch, \n483-89 [see #1181].\nThe purpose of this brief article is to present an overview of scholarship on the \nQumran manuscript 4Q158 as an illustration of how radically the understanding of what \nconstitutes a scriptural text has changed since 4Q158 was first published in 1968. At the \nend of the article I will offer a suggestion concerning the purpose of 4Q158 and how it \nexemplifies the use of Scripture by learned scribes in the Second Temple period.

[Qumran] Gunnel ekroth, “A View from the Greek Side: Interpretations of Animal\nBones as Evidence for Sacrifice and Ritual Consumption,” JAJ 7 (2016) 35-50.\nE.’s paper addresses the animal bone material from ancient Qumran from the comparative\nperspective of zooarchaeological evidence recovered in ancient Greek cultic \ncontexts. Specifically, the article first offers an overview of the paramount importance of \nanimal bones for the understanding of ancient Greek religion and sacrificial practices in \nparticular, and then continues with a review of the Qumran material, taking as a starting \npoint the zooarchaeological evidence and the archaeological find contexts. The methodological\ncomplications involved in letting the written sources guide the interpretation of \nthe archaeological material are highlighted, and E. suggests that the Qumran bones are to \nbe interpreted as remains of ritual meals following animal sacrifices, as proposed by Jodi \nMagness. The presence of calcined bones additionally supports the proposal that there was \nan altar in area L130, with E. arguing that the absence of preserved altar installations in \nmany ancient sanctuaries cannot be used as an argument against their ever having been \npresent. Finally, the similarities between Israel and Greek sacrificial practices are touched \nupon by E., who underscores the advantages of a continued and integrated study of these \ntwo sacrificial systems based on zooarchaeological evidence. See ##1122, 1123, 1124, \n1126, 1127, 1131. [Adapted from published abstract—C.T.B.]\n1114. [DSS] yoram erDer, “Understanding the Qumran Sect in View of Early Karaite \nHalakhah from the Geonic Period,” RevQ 26 (2014) 403-23.\nAfter reviewing scholarly assumptions about Karaite familiarity with Qumranic literature,\nE. enquires about the extent to which evaluations of Qumranic influence on the \nKaraites can work backward to enlarge knowledge of the Qumran scrolls that they encountered.\nE.’s study focuses on two fringe figures, Benjamin al-Nahāwandī and Mīshawyhi \nal-\u200a>\u200aHkbarī, of the Karaite Avelei Zion (“Mourners of Zion”), whom the mainstream Karaite \nmovement rejected, apparently owing to their excessive loyalty to the ancient halakha that \n', '348 OLD TESTAMENT ABSTRACTS Vol. 40, 2017\nthey had come to possess. E. focuses on three specific areas where the pair’s halakhic \nrulings show affinity with Qumran: (1) the Passovers of the desert (Numbers 9) and of \nHezekiah (1 Chronicles 29–30); (2) the half-shekel tax (Exod 30:11-16); and (3) the consumption\nof “desired meat” (Deut 12:20-21). These affinities demonstrate the importance \nand meaning which the Qumran sect would have given to living in the desert.—G.Y.G.\n1115. [DSS] ravit FerBer-rotBerG and eyal reGev, “Names and Self-Designations in \nQumran: The Theology of Self-Identity,” Beit Mikra 61 (2016) 99-125 (Hebrew).\nThe authors focus on the names and designations for the Qumran sectarians used in \nthe sectarian scrolls. Many of the self-designations—“holy ones,” “men of truth,” “people \nof righteousness,” “sons of light”—represent positive attributions which are also applied \nto God. By means of these self-designations, the community stakes its claim to be the \ncommunity that is closest to God, and a channel for conveying God’s divine inspiration \non earth. There is a close correspondence between these positive attributes and the content \nof the Instruction of the Two Spirits (1QS 3:13–4:26). Being of God, in the name of God, \nand committed to God are the common element in all the names and self-designations in \nquestion, this implying a dualistic approach to the confrontation with evil.

[11QMelch] miChael Flowers, “The Two Messiahs and Melchizedek in \n11QMelchi zedek,” JAJ 7 (2016) 194-227.\n11QMelch identifies several eschatological figures in the text of Isa 52:7: prophets, \na first and second herald, the community, and (probably) Melchizedek. The heralds are differentiated\nfrom one another—a point that has been largely overlooked in discussions of \n11QMelch. They are also differentiated from the “mountains/prophets” of the source text, \nanother significant point that has been rarely emphasized. That the first herald is a Davidic \nMessiah is suggested by the author’s quotation of the “70 weeks” prophecy of Dan 9:2427,\na passage that was often used to calculate the advent of the Davidic Messiah. If then the \nlacuna in line 18 contained a clause from Dan 9:25, this would provide further support for \nidentification of the first herald with the Davidic Messiah, since the Danielic verse refers to \n“the prince Messiah.” Moreover, in the history of interpretation, Isa 52:7 was understood, \nat least by some Christians and Jews, as referring to the Davidic Messiah. Hence, there \nare grounds for seeing the first herald not as an angel or Prophet-Messiah but as a royal \nMessiah. Melchizedek—who goes by the alias of “prince of light” and “Michael” in other \nworks—is distinguished from the two heralds in 11QMelch’s interpretation of Isa 52:7. He \nis not a Messiah figure, but rather the chief patron angel who fights on behalf of the sons \nof light against Belial in the great eschatological war. The second herald is described in \n11QMelch as a teacher and may therefore be the “Messiah of Aaron”/“Interpreter of the \nLaw” referred to in other sectarian works. The interpretation proposed by F. here allows \nparallels to be drawn between 11QMelch and other sectarian works. Contrary to what is \ncommonly supposed, 11QMelch does not seem to reflect a form of messianism that is \nnotably distinctive, but rather one that conforms to the diarchic messianism found in other \nsectarian works.

[DSS] Florentino GarCía martínez, “La ‘alianza nueva’ en los textos de Qumran,”\nSalm 63 (2016) 23-43.\nG.’s article surveys the use of the “covenant” (bryt) concept in the DSS and calls \nattention to the evolution regarding the concept one finds in this material, the Damascus \n', ' ARTICLES/Intertestamental, Apocrypha, NT Use: Qumran 349\nDocument and the Rule of the Community in particular vis-à-vis the OT itself. This evolution\nbecomes concrete in the Damascus Document’s use of the expression “new cov-\nenant” to refer not only to the “renewal” of the Mosaic covenant announced by Jeremiah as \napplied to the group or groups behind the Damascus Document but also to a real “novelty,” \ninvolving a “reduction” of the meaning of the concept and the reapplication of the biblical \ncovenant between God and all Israel to one that is restricted to those who freely decide \nto join the group and enter the “new covenant” in order to faithfully observe the “hidden \nthings” of the Law of Moses which had been revealed to the group but which were not \nbeing observed by the rest of “Israel.” [Adapted from published abstract—C.T.B.]\n1118. [Community Rule] maxine l. Grossman, “Community Rule or Community Rules: \nExamining a Supplementary Approach in Light of the Sectarian Dead Sea Scrolls,” \nEmpirical Models, 303-30 [see #1187].\nG.’s essay focuses on three distinct types of textual variation in eleven Qumran \ncopies of the Serek Hayaḥad (1QS, 4Q255–264), and ponders the significance of the differences\namong the manuscripts for our understanding of original texts and textual formation \nin an ancient Jewish setting. In her view, the textual profiles of the surviving copies of the \nCommunity Rule problematize any simplistic notion of linear evolutionary development \nfrom earlier texts to later ones, since the supplementation that is encountered is one of \naddition (or expansion) but also of subtraction (or contraction). More generally, the manuscripts\nof the Community Rule are evidence for a situation of simultaneous textual diver-\nsity in which it is possible that each distinct edition of the rule was understood as saying \n“the same thing.” [Adapted from published abstract—C.T.B.]\n1119. [DSS] hinDy haJman and eiBert tiGChelaar, “A Preparatory Study of Nomenclature\nand Text Designation in the Dead Sea Scrolls,” RevQ 26 (2014) 305-25.\nThe authors review the history of nomenclature for the Dead Sea Scrolls in the DJD \nSeries and more recent projects. Sometimes the names are derived from the opening words of \ncompositions (e.g., 1QM, 1QS), or terms frequently used in them (e.g., Bera khot, Hodayot), \nbut often assume either canonical divisions (e.g., “Apocryphon of,” “Prayer of,” “PseudoX”),\nor genre differentiation between sectarian and nonsectarian texts (e.g., “Pesher,” “Rule”), \nor are rooted in generic terms borrowed from other corpora (e.g., Hala kha, Midrash). Scroll \nscholars (e.g., J. Strugnel, E. Tov, J. H. Charlesworth, E. Qimron) have highlighted many of \nthe implicit presuppositions behind the nomenclature and emphasized the need for a reconsideration\nof the way in which the scrolls are named, classified, and conceived. H. and T.’s \narticle proposes preliminary directions for meeting this challenge.—G.Y.G.\n1120. [1QS, etc.] DaviD hamidović, “Living Serakhim: Process of Authority of the Community\nRule,” Process of Authority, 61-90 [see #1180].\nH.’s study focuses on what he calls the “cluster” constituted by the Community Rule \n(1QS) and a series of other manuscripts more or less closely related to this. In seeking to \naccount for the differences among the cluster’s component manuscripts, H. highlights the \nimpact on them of the various “editorial projects”—messianic, calendrical, priestly—of \nthe scribes responsible for them. At the same time, he also emphasizes that the variations \nobservable among the manuscripts (e.g., regarding communal rules) reflect authoritative \ndecisions taken by the community as a whole (the “Many” cited in 1QS).—C.T.B.\n', '350 OLD TESTAMENT ABSTRACTS Vol. 40, 2017\n1121. [4Q158] reinharD G. kratz, “Reworked Pentateuch and Pentateuchal Theory,” \nFormation of the Pentateuch, 501-24 [see #1181].\nOur subject in this paper was the possible implications of the 4QReworked Pentateuch\nmanuscripts for the pentateuchal question. Looking in both directions, to 4Q158 \nas well as to the MT, I have to say that I cannot see any difference in their compositional \nstrategies; on the contrary, I see a great deal of similarity in terms of their respective \ncompositional techniques and content as well. As far as the Reworked Pentateuch manuscripts\nare concerned, we are dealing with “biblical” manuscripts, and so these texts are \nin every respect comparable to what we have in the MT or the SP. Even if we were to \nclassify the Reworked Pentateuch manuscripts and the SP as a kind of Rewritten Bible or \nRewritten Scripture (the same sort of literature as, e.g., Chronicles, Jubilees, the Temple \nScroll, etc.), the comparability is a given, not least since the Pentateuch itself seems to \nbe a product of a permanent rewriting of older traditions. This result has, of course, enormous\nimplications for the pentateuchal question and the different hypotheses that are \nadvanced to answer it. I see two primary implications. First, on the methodological level, \nthe Reworked Pentateuch text is an example of various compositional techniques and \nmodels for how a text (or at least a narrative text, but I think also texts of other genres), \nhas grown within the biblical tradition. Second, on the historical level, the Reworked \nPentateuch manuscripts, like all other versions (MT, SP, LXX, Rewritten Bible), are witnesses\nto the same text and part of the same literary and textual history. They progress \nfurther along the path, which begins with the literary and redactional history of a biblical \ntext and which indicates the direction in which we must proceed in order to trace the history\nof extension, supplementation, and revision—in short Fortschreibung—and exege-\nsis of the Pentateuch. Here, as well as there, the Supplementary or Revisional Hypothesis \n(Fortschreibungshypothese) has proven itself an appropriate model that is superior in its \nexplanatory power to the Source or Documentary Hypothesis.

The Animal Bone \nDeposits Reconsidered,” JAJ 7 (2016) 5-34.\nAmong the most puzzling features found at the Qumran site are deposits of animal \nbones belonging to sheep, goats, and cattle, mixed with ash, which were placed on the \nground between large potsherds or inside jars and covered with little or no earth. The \ndeposits are concentrated in open air spaces, mainly on the northwest and southwest sides \nof the site. Following Roland de Vaux, most scholars have interpreted these deposits as the \nremains of ritual, but not non-sacrificial, meals eaten by the Qumran sectarians. However, \ncomparison with remains from ancient sanctuaries from around the Mediterranean world \nand the Near East leave little doubt that these deposits represent sacrificial refuse and consumption\ndebris. Furthermore, records from de Vaux’s excavations suggest that in the 1st \ncent. B.C.e., an altar was located in an open air space on the northwest side of the site. The \npossibility that animal sacrifices may have been offered at Qumran is further supported by \nlegislation present in sectarian works and in non-sectarian documents that were considered \nauthoritative by the sect. This evidence suggests that the Qumran sectarians observed the \nlaws of the desert camp with the tabernacle in its midst, including offering animal sacrifices\nas mandated by biblical law.

[Qumran] susan marks, “Reconsidering Reclining at Qumran,” JAJ 7 (2016) \n86-101.\nM..’s article reexamines the default assumption that the diners at Qumran did not \nrecline. The article not only highlights the sparseness of evidence for meals eaten while \nsitting at the site, but also considers what has been overlooked on the part of those who \ndiscount the possibility of more elaborate celebratory dining by the Qumran sectarians. \nBuilding on scholarship that has noted parallels between Qumran and Hellenistic voluntary\nassociations, as well as a reconsideration of the Community Rule and archaeological \nevidence from the site, M. investigates new ways of looking at the Qumran evidence. That \nevidence challenges assumptions of homogenous eating practices, allowing for other possibilities,\nsuch as that the community only “dined” on Shabbat, or once a month, in smaller \ndining spaces, while the site’s largest dining space may have been used differently, by \neveryone, when they ate but did not dine.

[Qumran] Dennis mizzi, “The Animal Bone Deposits at Qumran: An Unsolvable \nRiddle?” JAJ 7 (2016) 51-70.\nDespite numerous attempts at elucidating the significance of the animal bone deposits\nfound at Qumran, the phenomenon remains one of the most elusive aspects of Qumran \narchaeology. Among the many proposed hypotheses, there are those who see the deposits \nas the remains of sacrifices carried out at Qumran, a line of interpretation that has been \npicked up afresh by Jodi Magness. In his paper, M. argues that while Magness makes a \ncompelling case for seeing the bone deposits as the remains of sacrifices, the totality of the \nevidence does not seem to support her contention that sacrifices were offered at Qumran \nitself. Nevertheless, Magness’s hypothesis provides an important basis for further explorations\nof the significance of the deposits. In this connection, M. suggests two alternative \nexplanations of the phenomenon, i.e., the animal bones could represent sacrificial remains \nof animals offered in the Jerusalem Temple but consumed at Qumran, or, they might be \nseen as evidence for the ritualization of ordinary meals involving the consumption of meat \nat the site. In the end, it must be acknowledged that the phenomenon may very much pose \nan insolvable riddle—the bone deposits may be identified as the remains of ritual activity, \nthe meaning of which, however, may well be irrecoverable.

The Literary Evidence,” JAJ 7 \n(2016) 71-85.\nStudy of the textual evidence preserved in the DSS makes it exceedingly unlikely \nthat the sectarians would have conducted sacrificial worship at their desert retreat. They \n', '352 OLD TESTAMENT ABSTRACTS Vol. 40, 2017\ndisagreed vehemently with the Jerusalem establishment and refused to worship at the Temple\nbecause the sacrificial ritual there did not accord with their halakhic ideals. However, \nthey still maintained that the Temple was the only proper place to worship; it just had to be \nrenewed under their aegis at the End of the Days, when they would control all its functions. \nIn the meantime, the sectarians viewed their community as a substitute Temple: they conducted\nprayers at the times when the Temple sacrifices took place; their communal meals \nbecame ritualized as a replacement for the Temple offerings; they studied the laws of sacrifices.\nPriests and Levites were given roles of preeminence, the communal meals and study \nsessions substituted for Temple rituals, and the ritual purity that the sect maintained assured \nthem that they would be ready for the soon-to-dawn eschaton that would restore the glory \nof the Temple to them. Thus, the literary evidence points to a longing for the Temple on \nthe part of the Qumranites, but also to a resignation that, until the End of the Days arrived, \nvarious alternative modes of worship would have to substitute for its sacrifices.

The overlaps indicate that 4Q370 and Mas 1m were copies of the same work and were \nnot limited to a narrative of the flood and an admonition, as assumed by C. Newsom and \nE. Tov, but included as well a section on the patriarchs, a state of affairs suggesting that the \nMasada fragments be called “MasAdmonFlood (olim MasapocrGen).”—G.Y.G.\n1129.

[4Q185; 4Q525] elisa uusimäki, “‘Happy Is the Person to Whom She Has Been \nGiven’: The Continuum of Wisdom and Torah in 4QSapiential Admonitions B \n(4Q185) and 4QBeatitudes (4Q525),” RevQ 26 (2014) 345-59.\n4QSapiential Admonitions B (4Q185) and 4QBeatitudes (4Q525) are two early, possibly\n2nd cent. B.C.e., wisdom texts, containing nothing that is specifically sectarian. Both \nreflect the association and identification, well established in Second Temple Judaism (Sir \n15:1; 19:20; 24:23; Bar 3:9–4:4; and cf. Deut 4:5-6; Ezra 7:14, 25; Jer 8:8; Psalms 1; 19; \n119), of wisdom and Torah. However, the actual Hebrew term, twrh surprisingly occurs \nonly once in 4Q525 (2 ii 4) and not at all in 4Q185. Instead, both texts make references to \nTorah and/or Wisdom by employing the third person feminine singular suffix h in a way \nthat can refer to both, since both terms are grammatically feminine. This may be seen in \nsuch macarisms as “Happy is the person to whom she is given (ntnh)” (4Q185 1-2 ii 8-10) \nor “happy are those who hold fast to her statutes” (4Q525 2 ii 1). U. argues that the technique\nis pedagogical, serving to pun on and highlight the essential identity of wisdom and \ntorah.—G.Y.G.\n1131. [Qumran] CeCilia wassén, “The (Im)purity Levels of Communal Meals within the \nQumran Movement,” JAJ 7 (2016) 102-22.\nScholars usually take for granted that the sectarian members of the Qumran movement\nate their communal meals in a full state of purity at a level that is often compared \nto that of the priests serving in the Temple. This assumption rests on the interpretation of \nthe term hatôhôrâ, “the purity,” as pertaining to the Qumranites’ communal meals. But a \ncareful study of a range of texts, including the important document Torhorot A, leads to \na more nuanced picture, in light of which it is crucial to distinguish between the movement’s\ncommon, everyday meals and its special meals. Whereas a mild level of impurity on \nthe part of the participants was accepted at the ordinary type of communal meals, special \nmeals required a greater degree of purity. Even at these pure meals, however, there were \nvariations concerning the required level of purity, depending on the nature of the occasion \nbeing observed.

[Qumran/DSS] ian werrett, “Walking over the Dead, Burial Practices and the \nPossibility of Ritual Innovation at Qumran,” Ritual Innovation, 151-65 [see \n#1185].\nThe archaeological evidence from Khirbet Qazone and Jerusalem, not to mention \nthat from ‘En el-Ghuwelt, Haim el-Seha, and a half dozen other sites, argues against the \nnotion that the Qumran Community reinterpreted a popular burial style so as to mitigate the \ncontaminating effect of graves. Similarly the extant evidence from the scrolls and Khirbet \nQumran fails to prove that the inhabitants of Qumran were critical of other Jews who participated\nin secondary reburials by engaging in primary burials in shaft graves. Not only \ndo the limited number of excavated graves at Qumran and elsewhere in the region prevent \nus from saying anything certain about the Qumran cemetery, there is absolutely no proof \nthat the shaft-style burial architecture with side niches was used for a different purpose \n', '354 OLD TESTAMENT ABSTRACTS Vol. 40, 2017\nat Qumran than it was at other sites. . . . As opposed to being unusual or unique, it turns \nout that burials at Qumran are not terribly dissimilar from those of other cemeteries in the \nregion. And while we may yet discover evidence that the shaft-style burials at Qumran are \nemblematic of some form of ritual innovation, the archaeological data currently available \nappear to point in a different direction. This is not to say, however, that we should refrain \nfrom proffering theories to account for the evidence at our disposal. Rather, as we continue \nto refine our hypotheses about the DSS and Khirbet Qumran, we must be honest about the \nlimitation of our knowledge and careful to differentiate between the archaeological record, \nthe textual evidence, and the scholarly imagination.

[4QInstruction, etc.] BenJamin wolD, “Jesus among Wisdom’s Representatives: \n4QInstruction,” Enoch and the Synoptic Gospels, 317-35 [see #1294].\nW.’s essay seeks to bring the Jesus and Enoch traditions into conversation with the \npresentation of the anonymous maškil in 4QInstruction and the Self-Glorification Hymn. \nHis comparison of these corpora highlights the degree to which exclusivist associations \nwith wisdom by exalted figures are intertwined with claims to authority and legitimacy in \nthe material in question.

[4Q158] molly m. zahn, “Scribal Revision and the Composition of the Pentateuch:\nMethodological Issues,” Formation of the Pentateuch, 491-500 [see #1181].\nThis essay originated in a session of the 2014 Jerusalem conference that used one \nof the 4QReworked Pentateuch manuscripts, 4Q158, as a lens for exploring the possible \nrelevance of these and related Second Temple texts for the question of the composition of \nthe Pentateuch. I was asked to reflect on these issues in light of one particular fragment of \n4Q158 that is particularly rich in thought-provoking features. In what follows, I will use \nthese features to address two main questions. First, if a text like 4Q158 is deemed relevant \nto pentateuchal theory, what might this relevance look like? How would it change the ways \nwe approach the traditional pentateuchal text? Second, what methodological challenges \ndoes this sample fragment raise for pentateuchal theory in general and in particular for the \nuse of Second Temple texts as part of this endeavor? I do not want to dwell too much on \nthe question of whether 4Q158 and similar texts should be deemed relevant to the understanding\nof earlier, non-documented stages in the composition of the Pentateuch. Broadly \nspeaking, the textual remains discovered at Qumran constitute the corpus most historically \nand culturally proximate to the context or contexts in which the traditional text of the Pentateuch\nlikely took shape. We should therefore expect there to be certain continuities in the \nways that scribes approached their exemplars. Initial explorations support this: the work of \nMichael Fishbane, David Carr, Reinhard Kratz, and others has highlighted similarities of \nscribal approach and exegetical technique between Second Temple materials and the text as \nit has come down to us in the MT. Thus I begin from the partially evidence-based assumption\nthat the tools scribes used to reshape existing texts and compose new ones would have \nbeen substantially the same in the Second Temple period as they were in earlier times. If \nthis is our starting point, 4Q158 can become a resource for illustrating the kind of things \nscribes might do with an earlier text. Insofar as we believe that pentateuchal texts draw on \nearlier materials, we might expect them to rewrite and reconfigure their sources in ways \ncomparable to those attested in 4Q158 and other Second Temple materials. Thus, a survey \nof a few of the notable cases of rewriting attested in 4Q158 1-2 is one way of considering \n', ' ARTICLES/Intertestamental, Apocrypha, NT Use: Other Writings/Traditions 355\nits relevance to pentateuchal materials. Of course, the single fragment does not represent \nthe full diversity of ways texts were rewritten in Second Temple contexts: this survey is \nmeant only to be suggestive.

[1 Enoch; Synoptic Gospels] JosePh t. anGel, “Enoch, Jesus, and Priestly Tradition,”\nEnoch and the Synoptic Gospels, 285-316 [see #1294].\nIt is testimony both to the central significance and the fluidity of priestly tradition \nin Second Temple Judaism that the non-Levites Enoch and Jesus attract priestly roles and \nidentity in the literature of the period. The priestly portrayals of the primeval patriarch \nEnoch in sacerdotal terms in the early Enochic corpus most likely did not directly influence\nthe image of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels. Rather, texts that scholars have shown \nto appropriate various motifs and attributes associated with Enoch in the literary constructions\nof separate ideal priestly figures have greater relevance for illuminating the priestly \nbackground of certain portrayals of Jesus in the Synoptics. In particular, the image of the \natoning servant-priest of 4Q541 provides significant background for the depiction of Jesus’ \nuniversal atoning function. Moreover the protagonist of 4Q541, as well as the speaker \nof the Teacher Hymns and those of SGH, provide important background for the portrait \nof Jesus as eschatological teacher/revealer of divine wisdom featured in Matt 11:25-30. \nWhile it is tempting to posit that the Synoptic authors were aware of or perhaps even drew \non some of these traditions in their construction of the figure of Jesus, in no case does the \nevidence permit one to conclude to a direct literary dependence. The significance of these \ntexts for comprehending the Synoptic portrayal of Jesus lies rather in their illumination of a \nspecific trajectory of thought about priests and priesthood in which the gospels also apparently\nparticipate. As we might expect, however, given the gospels’ concern to spotlight \nother aspects of Jesus’ identity, the priestly element associated with Jesus remains beneath \nthe surface in this material.

Basing himself on the views of various NT interpreters and taking the influence\nof 1 Enoch on the Matthean text as his point of departure, A.’s comparison not only \nunderscores the materials’ common features and settings but also puts into sharp relief the \nelement of surprise in Matthew’s scene, which functions to exhort readers to vigilance by \nwarning them about the unexpected.
