It is in view\not these facts that many of the import\nant railroads have determined to re\ndouble their efforts to secure in this j\ncountry that ri^icl enforcement of the]\nlaw against trespassing, which, in\nEngland, has reduced the practice ? and\naccidents to trespassers ? to a minimum.\nThe number of people killed while\ntrespassing on railroads has been ineeas- 1\nin# every year. In lHO\'.f, 400:1 trespass\ners lost their lives on American rail\nroads; five years later the number was\n5000, and in 11107, the nnml>er killed\nwas .1(112? more than 15 a day. These\nfigures are taken from the annual re\nports of the interstate commerce com\nmission. Figures compiled hv one\nrailroad alone show that 4115 trespassers\nlost their lives on that system\'s lines in\n18011; 781 were killed ill 1004: while in\n1007 the number reached 9iS? an\naverage of almost three for every busi\nness day in the year. In the 10 years\nprior to January 1. 1000. exactly 7240\npeople, who were on the road\'s right of\nway in wilful violation of the law, anil\nin spite of thius.iuds of warning signs\nalong t lid railroad, were killed. In\naddition, during the first six mouths of\nthis year, 275 trespassers were killed. ?\nExchange.\nS >me Good Advice\nA Young Thing had a head that\nached, her honey boy having taken his\naffections elsewhere, and her father\nrecently shut himself up with her to\nreason with her, says an Iowa pajier.\n"That honey !>oy averaged spending 50\ncents a week <>n you," lie said.

This shortage was in\ncurred principally during the first three\nmonths of the year IU0N and the\nbandsmen whom the stato is trying to\nhold good for the amount contemplate\ntaking legal stops to place the res|ionsi\nbility for his shortage u|K>n State\nController Eggors, who was delinquent\nin not checking up the shortage\nwithin a reasonable time. The\nbondsmen call attention to the fact\nthat had Eggors properly jierformod his\nduties as the auditing ofllcial,\nthey would have had an opportuuty\nto have had protected themselves and\nthe business logic of their argument\nis at once apparent.\nThe discrepancies in his accounts\nwith the state, together with other\nshortages uncovered subsequent to the\nsuicide of the ex-sheriff, makes his\nknown shortage nearly $5,000, which\nwill, in case the contentions of the\nbondsmen are rejected, muke necessary\nthe payment by them of this sum.\nFallon Standard.\nCold Weather Advice\ntn nil Is to hewn re of coughs mid\nJ colds on t In- chest ; ns neglected t hey\nreadily lend to iMieiitnoiiin, consuuip\nHonor other pulmonary troubles\nI Just iih soon nn th > cough nppciire\nf ti\'ii t It with Mallard\'s llorchotiml\nSyrup, the standard cure of Ainerl\nen.

There is now small excuse for\nfailure.\nWhat makes a inineY The mining en\ngineer, who has practical experience and\nscientific insight into all phases of the\nmineral industry, will answer by saying\nthat it is a land property from the\nImiwcIs of which valuable minerals may\nlie extracted profitably and in com\nmercial quantities. So, also, contrary\nto popular opinion, an ore is a mineral\ndeposit which, on a merchantable scale,\ninny be worked with profit. Such is\nthe definition which the legitimate\nbusiness of mining today recognizes the\nworld over. A mining proposition\npasses through a number of distinct\nstages, or transformations, before such\nposition is attained. Until it does reach\nthis position its stocks are not the\npropor fieldjn which the general public,\nor persons unacquainted wiih the tnin\ning industry, should Iks invited or ad\nvised to invest .\nWith this definition the picturesque\nprospector of days now gone by does\nnot inakoof his lonely claim a mini\' by\nsimply calling it such. The mountaineer,\nwith his pick and shovel, has only hope\nstrong in his breast. The sturdy little\nband that is doing development work\nis yet u long, long way off from a mine.\nIt is by unhatched propositions of this\nkind that the wily promoter endeavors\nto entrap the credulous. Not one in ti\nthousand of these schemes develop:\nint? u real mine. A dividend-produc\ning miner is made of sterner and bettei\ntested stuff. ? Review of Reviews.\nTAFT ON SHIP SUBSIDY\nPresident Tuft waited until ho got ti\ntlio Piicific coast before nnlimbering hi\nspeech ? favoring a ship subsidy stea\nfrom the public. Not a word about i\nin Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska\nColorado or Montana. These state\nwould have, to contribute, and woul\nreceivo no passible return for their cor\ntribntions. In these he patted th\nfarmers on the back and talked of th\nconservation of national resource\nwhich, under republican administri\ntions, have been depleted and destroye\nfjr personal profit and without tli\nslightest regard for the country\'\nfuture.\nOn the eastern and western coast\nthere are to tie found combinations t\ncapital that would lie directly henefitc\nin a financial way by a ship suhsidt\nThe president\'s remarks on the snbjet\naro reserved for these.\nWhat does the president propose t\ntake from the pockets of the jtooplo an\ngive to the builders and owners of ship*\nHero is the list of items: Kuough t\ncover the greater expense of luboi\nenough to cover the greater expense i\nmaterial; enough to cover the g route\ncost of equipping, manning and mail\ntiiining ships; and lastly, an ainotui\nequal to the subsidies given to thei\nown ships by foreign nations.

The democrats\nin congress will opjxise it to a man,\nand there will lie enough "progressives."\nelected as republicans but trying to rep\nresent the Interests of their consfifu\nmils, to furnish the number of votes req\nulsite to defeat the gigantic steal.\nKansas City I\'osf.\nPASSING OF TBE\nSILVER DOLLAR\nThe silver dollar gradually is going\nout of circulation. Today there are\nabout 71,(K>0.000 of them in circulation,\nwhich is the smallest muutier in recent\nyears. Thro? years ago there were\nabmt 82; 000. 000 passing through the\nvarious channels of trade. The reason\nfor the unpopularity of the silver dollar,\nit is saiil at the Treasury Department,\nwas that the liovernment for the last\ntwo years has d ecu tied to pav the ex\npress charges 011 shipments of tlietn to\nthe treasury for exchange for notes of\nsimilar value. There were more than\n$80,000,000 in circulation when Congress\nrefused to appropriate money for pay\ning express charges. Immediately the\nmovement of silver dollars decreased 75\nper cent. Because of their size and\nweight, they already have Ihmii discard\ned in the mercantile centers of the\nNorth and East, hut they still retian\nfavor in the West and the Southwest in\nall parts of the South.\nPAYING REPUBLICAN TARIFF\nTAX ON CLOTHING\nOne of the matters which the people\nhad in their minds when they asked\nthe government to arrange the tariff\nlaw so that it would bear a little less\noppressively ujiou them was clothing.\nClothing costs far more in the United\nStates than it does in any other part\nof the world, although this country\nproduces most of the world\'s cotton\nand a great part of\' the world\'s wool.\nIn spite of the fact that this nation\nsells abroad vast quantities of h it li of\nthese principal materials f ?r clothes\nmaking, and that with its improved\nmachinery and intelligent labor it ought\nto beat the world, the price of clothes\nis higher here than it is anywhere else\nin the world: and the reason is th it the\ntariff schedules are s ? high as t > tax all\nthe p.\'ople through every article >f cloth\ning they buy. almost entirely f.?r the\nbenefit of a few mill owners who have\ndone nothing to earn this special priv\nilege.\nCongress did not low *r the wool\nschedules. It is asserted, in its de\nfense, that it did not raise them, either,\nthough until the full extent of the\nsleigh-of-haiul work accomplished by.\nAldrich is laid bare, nolxtdy can bo\nsure of that. Congress (lid not lower\nthe -jot ton schedules, hut it did raise\nthem, und it raised most heavily those\ncovering articles which most jx-ople\nbuy because most (teople can afford\nnothing better. These things were\ndone bv the tariff law which President\nTaft praises, and for voting against\nwhich lie has chastised the insurgents\nof the west.\nThese abstract facts are made morn\ninteresting by a few figures. Cloth\ning lias already increased in price ami\nstill further increases are promised\nfor next spring- The suit of clothes\nthat- you used to liny for fid is now\n$20, and the additional ?1 represent*\nyour tribute to the wool trust and the\nmill owners, though there was a large\ntribute in the old price of $10.

St Joseph Observer\nREQUIRING DIRECTORS\nTO DIRECT\nThe wreck or robin tv of banks per\nmitted by t i j ni\'lij ? i : t directors in\nnot exercising the vigilant supervision\nthat their position demanded has hap\npened often enough to make the ed\nitorial writers strongly endorse the de\ncision of the New York Supreme Court\nby which thirteen former directors of\nthe Trust Company of the Republic are\nheld financially responsible for the\nlosse,s suffered by the company through\nloans made ti|xni securities of the United\nStates Ship-Building C mip.iny. The\nfacts of the case are thus reviewed bv\nthe Philadelphia R;e ?rd.\n"In l\'JO\'J. when the rage of proinot\ning industrial trusts with Hoods of\nwatered stock was at its height, a\ncoterie of clever o|ierutors created the\nUnited States Ship-Building Company,\nknown as the Ship Trust. On the\nwatered stock the Trust Company of the\nRepublic advanced large sums of utonev,\nami after raking an enormous profit the\npromoters withdrew from the concern.\nThe Ship Trust was soon wrecked on\nthe shores of Wall street anil the Trust\nCompany of the Republic along with it.\nOf the ruin very little was left for the\ndepositors of the financial trust, while\nthe stock holders lost ail. One of the\nstockholders then brought suit against\nthe directors of the TruM Company of\nthe Republic, who had neglected to\ndirect, to make them responsible for the\nli>ss. As the result of the suit the court\nhas decided that the directors, with the\nexception of one who was absent at the\ncritical period of the financial trans\nactions tn-t ween the financial trust and\nthe promoters of tin? Ship trust must\nmake good the loss to the last dollar."\nIn delivering the opinion of the court,\n?Judge C. C. Van Kirk said in part :\n"Where the duty of knowing exists,\nignorance due to ucgligcnce of duty\ncreates the s.vtn ; liability its actual\nknowledge and failure to act thereon.\nWhere trusted officers cause loss, the\ndirectors who trusted them, and there\nfore neglected to exercise the care n\nreasonably prudent man would exercise\nin bis own affairs cannot esra|H> liability\nif such care would have avoided oi\nlessened the loss. It is not a full per\nformance of duty to employ competent\noflicers who are lielioved to lie reliable\nThe directors have other and additiona\nduties."\n"Directors who do not direct shouli\nheed the warning," says the Cleveland\nPlain Dealer, adding that the dccisioi\nhas framed in a judicial decree " i\nthought that has lieun in every think\ning man\'s mind." Further, the Plaii\nDealer says:\n"This should prove the death knell o|\nthe man who assumes to direct theaf\nfairs of an institution, who stands In;\nfore his community in the character ol\na trustee, but who, through negligent*!\nor incapacity, refuses to |ierform tin\nduties of a trustee of the director win\ndoes not direct.

That Alabama\nwas the state numb ring the thirty first,\ndoes not apjiear to have dawned on\nanyone until recently.\nAn interesting <| lestion now is:\nWhat will the congress do about this\nmost imperative mandate possible under\nthe existing system of government Y\nTalk is already afoot to the effect\nthat the leaders in congress, more\nespecially Senators Aldricli and Hale,\nin the senate, an. 5 Speaker Cannon, in\nthe house, will seek to ignore the\nmovements for a constitutional conven\ntion. Everything indicates that at\nleast for the present, the expresssion of\nthe will of two-thirds of the states will\nnot reach further than the pigeonhole\nof the desk of some committee chair\nman.\nIf such a fate is meted out to a\ndemand of the state legislatures which\nfavor the election of United States\nsenators by direct vote, what assurance\nis there that a demand of two-thirds of\nthe state for a convention to legalize an\nincome tax will receive any lietter treat\nment Y This is a pertinent question\nraised by some of the friends of an in\ncome tax who have contended from the\noutset that the submit ting of tne in\ncome tax question to th-? state legis\nlatures was merely a s,-h ?ine to prevent\nthe people from securing income tax\nlegislation.\nAs if to paw the war for the block\ni \'\ningotacoustitution.il convention, the\nstandpatters |>oiiit t> ine tact that\nwhile congress is commanded to take\naction in accordance with the demand\nof two-thirds of the states, there is\nabsolutely no method provided by\nwhich congress can l>e compelled to\noliey the constitution. A technical\nobjection is als i expected on the ground\nthat the resolutions passed by the state\nI legislatures are not uniform. There\n! pr ?mises to l>e elalxtrato explaining\nthat the action of some of th.< legisla\ntures did not constitute an "applica\n| tioii,*\' but amounted only t?> a ??state\nment," or a "declaration."\nIt is now ht\'ing recalled that Sena\ntor Owen of Oklahoma brought to the\nattention of senators during the last\nsession the fact that before the next\nmeeting the requisite nuinh -r of stat< s\nwould have acted uptii the question of\nelecting senators by a direct vote to\nput the matter squarely up to congress,\nlie is authority for the st it ?metit that\nboth Senators Aldricli and tl.de relink\ned him for his activity and told him it\nw.is\'n question the majority would ileal\nwith in its own time anil in its own\nI way. - Exchange\nI OH!
