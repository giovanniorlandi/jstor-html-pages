The governor’s conclusions, are given in the report of the com, missioners of prisons., The governor does not accept the, theory that the spirit of lawlessness, acquired bv men while serving with, the military forces is to blame for, tills outbreak of dishonesty., "The fact that women equally with, men are the offenders discounts the, value of Ibis explanation." he says., "I think the explanation is rather to, be found in the fact that high wages,, once easily earned more easily spent, are now not obtainable., USED TO "BIG MONEY", "Men and women, boys and Kiris, have all become used to big money\', out of all proportion to the slight, effort necessary to obtain it., "The slow hut sure economic re, adjustment of the past year has cre, ated a number of discontented reck, less people, who do not realize that, they have been living In an artificial, wage market and unconsciously re, sent the changed conditions of supply, and demand, work and pay., "They must have money to pro, vide the luxuries and amusements to, which they have grown accustomed, so they steal, pilfer and loaf ", \\ large Increase In garage-break, ing and motor-thieving is reported by, the Governor of Wadsworth jail,, whose view is that "the experience, and knowledge of motor mechanics, gained In the army" are largely re, sponsible for this., ELEMENT OF SPORT, " \\ sort of esprit lie corps seems, to have sprung up among these men.", adds the governor "It is a form of, thieving Hint has an element of sport, and pleasure, with good returns when, successful, and it seems to have, attracted many who would not other, wise have taken lo crime as a pro., fession ", “The rommitals to prison for non, payment of income lax show a, marked increase." slates the Govern, or of Rirmingham prison. "This in, crease would seem to call for some, alternative method of eolleetion. such, as deduction from wages when paid, Tim men earning high wages are not, taxed until some months afterward,, bv which time, as at present, work, is slack, and they have not the, money to pay ", Let I,on Smith do your kodak work., Northern Drug Store.

It is not a league or association of, nations. It does not entangle the l nited, States in issues or conditions not fundamental, ]\\ American. It decreases rather than in, creases the menace of war involving the, United States. In all this the treaty differs, fundamentally with the covenant of the League, of Nations., This compact does not ditler in character, from treaties this nation has hitherto executed., It represents no departure from American tra, ditions. While the benefits to the arrangement, mav in some quarters be over-estimated, there, are no perils lurking in the treat\' justifying, the opposition of those who refused to approve, the League of Nations, because it involved, American enta\'nglement in “the collusions and, illusions of European politics.”, In his speech presenting the proposed treat\', at the Washington conference. Senator Lodge,, •who led the tight on the un-Americanized, covenant of the League of Nations, said:, “There is no provision for the use, of force to cany out any of the terms, of the agreement, and no military or, naval sanction lurks anywhere in\' the, background or under cover of these, plain and direct clauses.”, If there were any reason for doubts on this, point, the declaration of Senator Lodge, in tin*, presence of those who formulated this treaty,, would remove it. Such a declaration, made, a part of the records of the proceedings of, the conference, is as much a binding interpre, tation of tins compact, as President Wilson’s, pledge to the Rumanian premier that the, Vnited States was bound to send troops to, Kurope in case of another Kuropenn war. was, of Article X of the League of Nations., There could be no serious objection to\' a, Senate reservation providing that the Inited, States government shall not be permitted or, required to use military or naval force in the, execution of the terms of the treaty, except, niton the affirmative action of the Congress, of the Inited States. Such a reservation, would not change the situation, so far as this, country is concerned, because Senator Lodge, has already made that definite delcaration a, part of the official record, but it would destroy, whatever plausibility may attach to the state, ment of some foes of the treaty that it binds, this natron to the decision of other powers as, to when we shall go to war., This treaty can he intelligently interpreted, only in connection with the Anglo Japanese, treaty, which it supersedes, and the agree, ments which have been reached at the Wash, ington conference providing for the preserva, tion of the sovereignty and territorial integ, rity of China., By the termination of tin* Anglo Japanese, treaty Japan is deprived of the prospect of, strong European support in case of a conflict, with the United States. The British govern, ment was anxious to he rid of the obligations, of this treaty because of its intense unpopu, larity in Australia and Canada, the only two, important British possessions in which there, lias been recently no serious unrest. There, was nothing altruistic in the desire of Eng, land to terminate the obligations of this com, pact, which could neither bo renounced nor, continued without great embarrassment. On, the other hand the United States could regard, that treaty as a possible menace only to this, nation, and therefore it was well worth while, to eliminate it., \' The settlement of the status of China, with, an assurance of the preservation of the sov, ereignty and territorial integrity of that vast, republic, is of prime importance to America., The people of this country believe that the, only serious danger of war involving the, United States arises from the imperialistic, ambitions of Japan, a swiftly growing mili, taristic and navalistic. nation, with strong de, signs on territorial expansion, as evidenced, by the developments of recent years on the, Asiatic mainland. The determination of the, United States to prevent unlimited Asiatic, immigration, the resentment of that policy by, Japan, the growth of Japanese |x>pulution in, Hawaii, in Mexico, Central America and South, America, all combined to create a situation, under which war1 bet ween .Japan and the Unit, <d States lias been a subject of general thought, find discussion. { Thoughtful Americans be, lieved that if Japan were given opportunity, to dominate and exploit China, with all her, rich resources artel huge population, we would, within a few ye airs confront a real menace on, the Pacific, One from which we could not j, pseape by retreat., At the conclusions of the Washington con, Xerence there will have been an agreement of, the powers, including Japan, upon the future, of China, confirming necessarily some wrongs, of the past, but correcting those done during\\, ;tnd since the war, and establishing beyond!, challenge the independence of\'China. Addi-;, tional vitality will hi* given these agreements, by tin* program of future conferences of the, powers with periodical settlements in detail, of questions that mpy arise involving interpn*, tations of the general policy agreed Upon., The l nited States lias a relationship t>*, and concern in Pacific problems dill\' rim, greatly from our relationship to and eoncern, in Kuropeni) problems. If the I nited Stati, possessed a peninsula and stretch of island\', reaching across tin North Atlantic to within, a few score miles of tin* Kuropean mainland,, and if we owned .1,100 islands just olT the, •oiitineiit ol Kuropc, occupying tin* same iela, live position as the British Isles, v <• could not, escape from implication in Kiiropeaii affairs., That is nur position in tin* Pacific. Uur slioc*, line on tin* North Pacific is far greater than, that of any other power, bordering it from, San Piegn to within sight of Siberia, and, again throughout the great length of. the, Philippine arehi)ndago. There are those who, believe that the great future of American, cross ocean commerce is in tin* Pacific basin,, no small part of it in (lliina, wln*re tin* I nitcd, States, because of tin* record it lias made in, international affairs, is the one nation trusted, by n people of tremendous possibilities., Taken in connection with tin* reduction of, annament program and the agreements rein, tivo to China, tin* four power treaty, in its, ornetienl effect greatly lessens it\' it docs not, •utirely eliminate the danger of war involving, the I nited States. Within the ten wars, neriod of the treaty, it is inenneeivalile that, tronhle will arise in the Pacific basin not pre, cipitated by one of the four powers which, ire parties to it; flic invoking of Article* 11., with its pledge of an attempt to reach an, igreeinent as to joint or separate action,, seems a most remote possibility. Should it, he invoked, however, we are hound only to, ■ommnnicate with the other powers fully and, frankly as to the most efficient measures to, he taken,\' jointly and separately, to meet the, exigencies of the particular situation. There, is not the slightest suggestion of compulsion, (in the Fnited States to; accept a majority, decision on this point, and no super govern, ment, alliance or association is created with, any power to act except through the voiun, tary co-operation of every signatory nation., By this treat\' we agree to keep our hands, off the property of other nations in the Pacific, involving America, Great Britain, France or, lapn*. and in ease of attack against any of, these powers we agree to confer as to tin*, best means of settling the trouble. That is all, \'hen* is to this compact., The National Republican would not hesitate, o denounce any compact involving the danger, »1‘ American involvement in any international, .itnation in which we are not, by reason of, •nr situation, necessarily concerned. This, •aper is against alliances, leagues and asso, •intions in which the right of this nation to, adependently decide upon its duties and re, ponsibilities is in the least impaired. The, National Republican is against international, sm, it is opposed to what may be called Euro, leanism as distinguished from Americanism., This paper can see in the approval of the four, •ower agreement no deviation from this posi, tion., On the other hand it does set; in this agree*, Santa Claus is, out of a job, at the other, stores but will, work one day, more at, 1, Clayson’s, The House of Quality, Mink, Marten, Beaver, Red, White and Cross Fox Skins., incut, ami in tlic whole work of the Washing, ton conference, tin* longest step yet taken in, all the histoiv of mankind, toward the pos, sihilitiy of future peaceful settlement of inter, national disputs. After the object lesson o|, the last war no one possessing the instincts, of humanity can fail to rejoice when the dan, ger of avoidable war is lessened., America, through the Washington confer, dice, is lending the way to world peace. There, is to In* no sacrifice, now or in the future, of, American rights, interests or ideals. Nothing, is more essential to the peace of the world,, to the welfare of the world, than that this, nation shall retain its full freedom.
