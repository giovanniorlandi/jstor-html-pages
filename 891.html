He died on November 27 at the age of\n79. Chal Johnson will long be remembered not just as one of\nthe world’s leading authorities on Japanese politics, but also\nas a giant among critical thinkers on U.S. policy in Asia. His\ngroundbreaking study of Japanese state capitalism—MITI\nand the Japanese Miracle (published in 1982)—challenged\nneoliberal political economy and set the stage for many\nsubsequent writings on state-guided economic development\nstrategies elsewhere in East Asia. Later in life, Chal\nproduced a masterful series of books on U.S. policy in which\nhe underscored the dangers of “blowback” (the title of the\nfirst in the series, published in 2000) not just for U.S. interests\nabroad, but also for democracy at home. The creation of\na permanent war economy, and its implications for democratic\nvalues, was a particular concern of his. Later books\nexpanded on these themes: The Sorrows of Empire (2004),\nNemesis (2006), and Dismantling the Empire (2010).\nAs a professor at the University of California, Berkeley,\nfor many years, Chalmers Johnson mentored numerous\nyoung scholars who have gone on to distinguished careers\nin the profession. Fittingly, one of them, Professor Peter Van\nNess, will assume Chal’s place on our advisory board.\nWe send our heartfelt condolences to Chalmers Johnson’s\nwife, Sheila, his family, and his many friends and\nadmirers.\nMel Gurtov\nEditor-in-Chief\n']</pre>
