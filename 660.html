Mrs. Mulcahey dressed her son, Put, cIuvcd years old, la his best suit, and put a bit of green ribbon 13 tbo, buttonhole of bis Jacket After mass, tbe O\'ltourke children came over to, the Mulcaheys to play with little Tut., There were Touiiuy O\'ltourke, seven, years old, aud Nora, who was nine., They, too, had greeu rlbboas oa their, breusts, and Mrs. Mulcahey, setting, tliein all down lu a row, told tbeui sto, ries of the patron sulut of Ireland? bow, he did away with the slavery of the, lower peoplo and how be rescued the, country from u false religion and es, tablished the true church. Sho also, told them of the wonderful miracles, done by St Patrick and the many peo, ple he saved from some impending, danger., Everybody knows that St Patrick\'s, day falls on the 17th of March und that, the l"tb of March Is near the begin, nlng of spring In tho southern states, sometimes It Is pretty warm at that, time, and the snow, melting farther, north, swells tho creeks, and the creeks, swell the rivers, aud occasionally they, have what Is called an Inundation., It happened that on this St Patrick\'s, day where these children lived they, had an tnundutlon. The O\'ltourke chil, dren wout home from tho Mulcaheys, about 3 o\'clock lu the afternoon and, found the water, which had not been, wlthlu half a rnllo of them in tbe morn, ing, was uow a foot deep all nround, tbe house. They thought it lots of fun to, bold up their clothes and walk lu the, water to their front door. Their mother, being out at work. Tommy made a raft, of some old boards he found Uoatlog in, tbo cellar, and then they had a tine, time pushing themselves around with, n clot lies polo., Hut tlio water kept getting deeper, and deeper, so that before durk the, lower floor of the house was covered, with water., The flood began to look serious to the, children, and they wished their mother, would come borne. But she had been, at work during the day at n bouse, built on lower ground tban her bome., nnd when the waters came up she was, obliged to stay nnd help the persons, living there to movo out their effects., So when night cniuc on sho bad not, come home, and by this tlino a bridge, over which sho must pass bad been, washed away, nnd she was prevented, from going farther., So Nora lighted a- lamp, imd sbe nnd, Tommy climbed the stairs to the see, oud story to get nwny from tbe water., Tommy began to be frightened, but, Nora told blm that there was no rea, son to bo scared. At any rate, If tbe.v, were In danger tho good saint tbat, Mrs. Mulcabcy bad been telling them, About In tho morning would take care, of them. But tbo water kept coming, higher and higher, nnd after awhile, they heard something crack below, and, tbe houge began to rock. Being of, wood. It had been lifted off Its founda, tion and was afloat, "Mother," said little I\'nt Mulcahey, that night, "we\'re lucky to be on thLs, high ground.", "Yes. we aro. It\'s dreadful to think, of people In the valley.", "1 wonder how It Is at the O\'liourkes.", "I don\'t know.", "I\'m going out to bavo a look.", "Don\'t you go far," said the mother, anxiously., I\'nt weut down toward the O\'Rourkcs., but when still some distance from there, he wus stopped by the flood. In the, direction of their houso he saw a light, slightly rocking, as though it wcro In n, boat All sorts of articles? boards, fur, nlturo nnd other things tbat would, float-swero slowly drifting about. Pat, was worried about bis two Ilttlo friends, and wished for a boat lu which to go, nnd sco bow they were getting on., But there was no boat at baud., Presently tho light lie had seen ap, peared to be drawing nearer. Put, watched It as It enrne on. and after, awhilo he could look Into n window., Some person or persons were Inside,, but the boy could not distinguish who, they were. Tbe bouse drifted to with, in u hundred feet of hltn, when It evl, ucnuy grounded. lor it uiun t come nuj, nearer. Then Pnt heard n child crying., A large board had floated near Tat., and lie resolved to go out to ttio bouse., So ho got some small pieces of wood, for paddles and pulled out. Coming to, a second story window, ho put In bis, bend., "Tommy," cried a girl\'s voice, "wo\'ro, saved. Here\'s St. Patrick corao to, take us to land", "I\'m Pat." said the little rescuer,, "but I\'m not the saint", "Oh, Pat. Is It you," cried Nora, re, lieved, "and have you come In a boat?", "No, I\'vo come on a board.", "My gracious goodness! We can\'t, go away on a board.", "It\'s a big one. Come. Tom. Pll tnke, you flrst: then I\'ll come back for Nora.", i Tommy looked out of the ,_wlndow, und, seeing the flood, drew back, but bis, sister urged him, and, getting on to, the plank, Pat pulled him to dry land, Then he returned for Nora and did tbt, same for bur., Scarcely had they left tbo bouse, : -.vhen it floated on., "If you\'ro not St Patrick," said Nora, jfter reaching terra flrma, "but only, Pat Mulcahey, 1 believe tbo saint sent, The children stayed that night at Mrs., Mulcabey\'s, and when their moth?r, I round them ; he.ro she was delighted., HIDDEN DANGERS., Nature <?ive?
