        <pre>['CHAPTER VIII \nIs Teaching Really by the Book? \nSUSAN S. STODOLSKY \nThere is a widely held belief that classroom instruction in \nelementary school is dominated by textbooks. Indeed, there is little \ndoubt that textbooks are present in most classrooms most of the time. ~ \nBut the assumption that textbooks drive instruction because they are \nubiquitous may not be tenable. Exactly what the presence of \ntextbooks signals about their use has not been adequately studied or \nanalyzed. In this essay I shall review the limited research literature on \nthis topic, raise some questions that need answers, and present some \npreliminary findings about textbook use in actual classrooms. \nWhat Does It Mean to Teach by the Textbook? \nAt first glance, this question seems to have an obvious answer. As \nFreeman suggests, "a prevailing image is of a teacher who begins \ninstruction on the first page of the book on day one and proceeds page \nby page through the entire text over the course of the academic, year. \'\'2 \nThe phrase "teaching by the book" conjures an image of close (if not \nslavish) adherence to textbook content, order, and suggested \nactivities, and implies that the textbook is the central, if not the only, \nmaterial used during instruction. \nTeaching by the book might be exemplified by a reading group \nworking through a basal reader lesson by lesson) Another example is \na social studies class following a common routine in which students \ntake turns reading orally from the textbook and then answer the \nbook\'s questions. 4 Math students who are regularly assigned problem \nsets from their textbook might also be seen as taught by the book. \nA definition of textbook-driven instruction derived from these \npresumably straightforward examples is more ambiguous than might \nThe support of the Benton Center for Curriculum and Instruction at the University \nof Chicago for the research reported in this chapter is gratefully acknowledged. Yu \nAmin Cheng provided valuable research assistance. \n159 \n', '160 ~ s  T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  B Y  T H E  B O O K ?  \nbe expected. To what extent and in what ways ought one adhere to \ntextbook content and suggestions in order to be teaching by the book? \nIf a teacher selects content from a given lesson, phrases her own \nquestions to the class, conducts a lesson suggested for small groups with \nthe whole class, or uses a worksheet prepared by another publisher, is \nshe teaching by the book? If the order of lessons is changed or certain \nsections of text are deleted, is instruction still textbook-driven? Does \nteaching by the book mean exclusive use of the book? \nTeaching by the book has often been taken as synonymous with \nteacher-centered lessons. There has been a facile and unwarranted \nequating of teacher-directed instructional techniques with textbook- \ndriven instruction. Particularly in subiects other than the basics, a \nvariety of instructional arrangements are called for in various \ncurricular programs. An image of teacher-led lessons, frequent \nrecitations, and seatwork is invoked to describe the textbook-driven \nclassroom. But all books do not call for these arrangements. The \nexistence of a teacher-centered program does not necessarily mean that \nthe textbook is being followed. Conversely, the creation of a student- \ncentered environment does not necessarily signal departure from a \ntextbook program. Some books and curricula require establishment of \npeer work groups, games, laboratory exercises, or computer-aided \ninstruction. To study teachers\' use of textbooks one should not \nmerely examine teachers\' classroom practices. Rather, comparisons \nmust be made of their practices with the requirements, recommenda- \ntions, and content of their textbooks. The particular nature of a \ntextbook or curriculum package must be considered more systemati- \ncally in determining its impact on instructional processes. \nThere are a number of components or aspects of textbook use to \ndistinguish in order to consider fully the ways in which we can say \ntextbooks dominate or influence classroom instruction. While \nsuperficially a simple idea, "teaching by the book" is actually open to \nmany interpretations. In fact, different grounds are adopted by \nindividuals when they assert that teaching is textbook driven. The \nvarious meanings attached to the idea of teaching by the book will be \nclarified in this chapter. \nFor analytic purposes, it is essential to separate various aspects of \ntextbook use, although it sometimes may be difficult to separate them \nin actual classroom practice. Such conceptual clarification is needed \nbecause clear distinctions have not been consistently present in the \nliterature on the role of textbooks in instruction. Researchers who \nhave studied the use and influence of textbooks on teacher planning \n', "S T O D O L S K Y  161 \nand instruction have approached the issue with different criteria in \nmind. \nThere are at least three major areas in which textbook use and \ninfluence should be defined and analyzed: topics, actual material \ncontained on the pages in the books, and activities suggested in the \nteacher's editions that accompany student texts. These three \ncomponents of textbooks constitute potential sources of influence on \nteaching and teacher planning, although these sources of influence are \nnot fully interdependent or mutually exclusive. Thus, a teacher can \nplan instruction around topics in the textbook but depart from the \nactual book materials. Similarly, suggested activities in teacher's \neditions can be used in conjunction with text materials or \nindependently. On the other hand, if the materials on the pages of the \nbook are actually used it follows that book topics are being covered. \nIn considering textbook use the particular characteristics of a book \nmust be determined. Too little attention has been given to the nature \nof books in relation to their use. Textbooks and teacher's editions are \nstructured differently according to the subject matter and grade level \nthey serveS--a fact ignored in most discussions of text use. It is likely \nthat aspects of textbook use vary in different subject areas and for \npupils of different ages. \nWhen texts are written, different principles of instructional design \nare frequently followed. Books also adhere to different philosophical \nand pedagogical positions. Among other characteristics, textbooks \nvary in their degree of specificity and prescriptiveness. Different series \nseek different educational goals. To determine accurately if a teacher \nis following a book, the composition of the book, its instructional \nrecommendations, and its topical content need to be considered \nsystematically in conjunction with classroom procedures. \nNoting the idiosyncratic nature of textbooks and curriculum \nmaterials places the study of textbook use squarely in the arena of \ncurriculum and program implementation. To assess the fidelity of an \ninstructional program, first the defining characteristics of the program \nmust be specified. The same principle must be followed in studying \nthe relation between teachers' classroom practices and textbooks or \ncurricular materials. \nResearch in Textbook Use \nTOPICS \nThe major influence textbooks are presumed to have on \n", '162 IS T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  BY T H E  B O O K ?  \ninstruction is in specifying topics and content to be covered. Content \ndetermination is a central educational decision with profound \nconsequences for student learning. Some studies of textbook use have \ninvestigated the match between textbook topics and instructional \ntopics. These studies essentially ask, Is the topical coverage in the \ntextbook isomorphic with topics actually taught by teachers in whose \nclasses the books are found? \nGrave concern about the role of textbooks in determining content \nstems from criticism of their actual content, as well as the way in \nwhich the books are structured. A frequent complaint is of superficial \ncoverage in which topics receive a "mention," particularly in social \nstudies and history books. 6 In other fields, such as mathematics, critics \ndecry a lack of richness in content and a slow pace that puts American \nstudents behind their Asian and European counterparts. DeSiiva \nreports that inaccuracies and errors are present in many books used in \nthe social sciences and sciences. 7 Sex, race, and class biases have also \nbeen documented. 8 \nThe quality of writing and text organization has often been found \nwanting, particularly as publishers have attempted to conform to \nreadability formulas? Chall showed that the reading material in \nliterature, reading, and history textbooks generally became simpler in \nterms of language structure, readability, and challenge over two \ndecades, coincident with declines in average student performance on \nthe SATA Â° Using schema theory, Armbruster and Anderson \ndescribed text in elementary social studies and science books as \n"inconsiderate" because it is structured with insufficient coherence \nand information) 1 The nature of the questions asked in reading series \nand textbooks in other school subjects has also been analyzed and \ncriticized by Armbruster and Ostertag and by Nicely, among \nothers.~2 \nStudies in the field of reading provide the most convincing \nevidence for a strong influence of textbooks on topical content. A \nnumber of investigators have confirmed that the content of basal \nreading series is used rather consistently, particularly in the primary \ngrades. 13 A teacher\'s pace in introducing new vocabulary, for \nexample, can be determined by examining the basal textbook in \nconjunction with time allocation to its pagesA 4 These studies leave \nopen the question of whether teachers follow suggestions for specific \ninstructional practices in the teacher\'s guides--a point to which I \nreturn later. \n', 'STODOLSKY 163 \nResearchers at the Institute for Research on Teaching at Michigan \nState University delineated a number of decisions teachers make about \ntheir instruction. The decisions are: "(1) how much time to allocate to \na subject, (2) what topics to cover, (3) with which students, (4) when \nand in what order, and (5) to what standards of achievement. \'\'Is They \nhave used a variety of methods in their research program on \nmathematics instruction in upper-elementary and junior high school. \nFreeman et al. defined a three-dimensional taxonomy of topics \nfound in math textbooks and standardized tests at the fourth-grade \nlevel: "The three dimensions of the taxonomy describe the general \nintent of the item (e.g., conceptual understanding or application), the \nnature of material presented to students (e.g., measurement or \ndecimals), and the operation the student must perform (e.g., estimate \nor multiply). \'\'16 They also determined the extent to which a given \ntopic was emphasized in a textbook by counting the number of \nstudent exercises devoted to it. Using the topics derived from the \nintersection of the l:axonomy dimensions, the researchers assessed the \nmatch between texts, instruction, and tests in a series of studies. \nFreeman and Porter investigated the influence of a variety of \nfactors, including textbooks and teacher\'s manuals, on teachers\' plans \nand instructional actions. 17 In the case of math teaching, they found \nthat textbooks had the most influence in the realm of topics and \nsequence and made little contribution to decisions about time \nallocation, defining standards, and determining which students should \nreceive particular types of instruction. \nNevertheless, in detailed case studies of math instruction in classes \nof seven elementary teachers in three school districts, Freeman and \nPorter gathered information that challenges the notion that most \nteachers teach by the book. 18 In the study, teachers kept logs of their \ninstructional practices and were interviewed periodically. In the \ninterviews, the investigators suggested three styles of textbook use \nand found teachers who fit into each of them. One style included strict \nadherence to both content and order of the book ("start with the first \nlesson of the book at the. beginning of the year and work straight \nthrough the book lesson by lesson"). In the second style the order of \ntopics in the text was preserved, but the teacher skipped certain \nportions. The third style was characterized by changing the order in \nwhich chapters or topics were presented--this type of teacher was \nseen as skipping around in the book. \nMore specifically, Freeman found that the teachers used an average \nof 35.2 percent of the lessons in their math textbooks) 9 When they \n', '164 i s  T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  BY T H E  B O O K ?  \nexamined the extent of coverage of specific topics in the texts, as \ndefined with their taxonomy, individual variation was also found. \nConsidering only topics that were emphasized in the textbooks (i.e., \nat least twenty student exercises dealt with the topic), teachers ranged \nfrom 64 percent to 90 percent coverage of those topics in their classes. \nOn the other hand, between 20 percent and 77 percent of the topics \nthat received little emphasis in the texts (i.e., less than five student \nexercises on the topic) were presented. \nThe case studies did show that textbooks have an influence on \ninstructional topics in elementary math classes. Over 80 percent of \ninstructional time in the observed classes was devoted to topics that \nwere covered in teachers\' primary textbooks. However, teachers were \nselective in their topical coverage and also supplemented instruction \nwith other materials. The overlap in topics among math textbooks at \nthis grade level is such that a certain similarity in topics occurs \nregardless of the book used. \nThese researchers believe the extent of teachers\' adherence to \ntextbook topics is a function of the degree to which teachers see the \ntextbook "as a legitimate content authority" and of their own \nconvictions about the content they think their students should master. \nWhile teachers vary in the way in which they use textbooks, they also \nvary in their beliefs3 Â° \nAn issue in the study of topics is how broadly or narrowly they \nare to be defined. The breadth or specificity of topic definition can \ninfluence the likelihood of finding a close correspondence between \ninstructional topics and those in text or curricular materials. If topics \nare defined very generally and broadly (e.g., operations with \nfractions, the Revolutionary War), it is more likely that a match can be \nfound between text topics and those that occur as a focus of \ninstruction. On the other hand, defining topics very narrowly is more \nlikely to result in some discrepancy between classroom practice and \ntext-prescribed topics. \nA similar but more limited effort to analyze textbook and test \ncontent was conducted by Armbruster et al. at the Center for the \nStudy of Reading at the University of Illinois in connection with three \nthird-grade reading curricula and two standardized reading tests. 21 \nSixteen reading comprehension skills, such as following directions, \nidentifying the main idea, and recalling details, were identified in the \ncurricular materials and tests. Individual reading curricula had \ndistinctive skill emphases and the tests did not tap many of the skills \naddressed in the textbooks. When topical analyses are done in some \n', 'S T O D O L S K Y  1 6 5  \ndetail in both math and reading, variation is found from textbook to \ntextbook, suggesting that the selection of a particular book could \nindeed be consequential in terms of the resulting content of an \ninstructional program. Unfortunately, Armbruster and her colleagues \ndid not directly address the actual classroom use of the reading \ntextbooks they coded for comprehension skills. \nThe studies at the Center for the Study of Reading and the \nInstitute for Research on Teaching stand as exceptions with regard to \nthe systematic classification of instructional topics in textbooks. \nPublishers specify scope and sequence in most textbooks--certainly in \nreading and mathematics--and Flanders has made use of that \ninformation to determine how much new content is introduced in \nmath texts from first grade through algebra. 22 Nevertheless, \nsystematic analyses of content coverage in a broad range of subjects \nand texts are not readily available. Closer to our central concern, in \nonly a few instances has the match between textbook topics and \nclassroom instruction been studied through direct observation, the use \nof teacher logs, or other reliable means. \nThere are other reports in which investigators have concluded that \ninstruction is dominated by textbooks. Some of the work used \nquestionnaire responses of teachers, while other investigators directly \nobserved or interviewed teachers. In their case studies of science and \nmathematics teaching, Stake and Easley concluded that "the source of \nknowledge authority was not so much the teacher--it was the \ntextbook. \'\'23 However,  their reports do not contain sufficient \ninformation to sharpen our understanding of the match between \ntextbook topics and instructional topics in other than a very global \nway. Several studies offer various kinds of evidence suggesting that \ntextbooks play an important role in teacher planning and actual \nclassroom instruction. 24 However, these studies do not explicitly \ndescribe the specific impact textbooks have on the topical content of \ninstruction. \nC O N T E N T S  O F  SECTIONS AND PAGES IN T E X T B O O K S  \nAnother way to consider textbook use is to determine the sections \nor formats contained in them and then examine teachers\' use of the \nvarious parts. Books differ in this aspect of textbook content as in \nothers depending on the subject matter treated and the intended grade \nlevel of the pupils. For instance, basal readers consist primarily of \nreading passages which extend over a number of pages by the middle \ngrades, comprehension questions to be answered after reading, and \n', '166 1S T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  BY T H E  B O O K .  ) \norienting questions at or near the beginning of the reading material. \nSome series also contain skill development exercises such as work on \nphonics or development of vocabulary, but others reserve such \nactivities for workbooks that accompany the basal reader or suggest in \nthe teacher\'s editions that teachers assign such activities. \nThe typical layout of a math book includes some pages of \ndevelopmental material followed by problem sets or exercises. \nChallenge problems or brain teasers are also built into certain math \ntextbooks, as are chapter reviews and "stay-up-to-date" sections \nwhich contain problems requiring the use of skills and concepts \ncovered earlier in the book. End of chapter tests are also included in \nsome series, and extra problem sets for students requiring additional \npractice are featured in some texts. \nThe most typical social studies textbooks consist of generously \nillustrated narrative text and sets of questions. In some books, \nquestions are interspersed throughout the narrative material; there are \nalso question sets at the end of each section and chapter. Some books \ncontain certain skill development exercises, such as map and chart \nreading and vocabulary lists, and some contain a variety of suggested \nactivities for students to pursue on the section topic. Chapter tests are \nalso included in some social studies books. \nData that directly bear on the use of different portions of textbooks \nare scanty. The two subjects in which some empirical data speak to \nthis issue are reading and math. In reading, the data suggest a rather \nclose adherence to the book material in that the basal reading passages \nappear to be used in sequence and generally without omissions. The \nclearest evidence on this point is provided by Barr and Dreeben at the \nfirst-grade level. 2s Durkin\'s studies of first-, third-, and fifth-grade \nteachers also suggest that basal reading passages are used rather \nconsistently, although she did not follow teachers over long \ninstructional sequences3 6 Through her observations of individual \nlessons, Durkin provided evidence that the end-of-section comprehen- \nsion questions and skill exercises are used regularly. Orienting \nquestions and development of vocabulary, however, seem neglected in \nthe classes she studied. \nIn math, it is commonly asserted that textbook sections (e.g., \nintroduction, practice exercises, enrichment, review) are used \ndifferently. Data from two large national studies characterize math \ntextbooks in use primarily as exercise books. 27 On questionnaires, \nstudents reported use of the problem sets in the books, but typically \nread only two out of every five pages in the textbooks. Students \n', "STODOLSKY 167 \nresponding to national surveys claimed the developmental and \nintroductory sections of math books were frequently skipped over \nduring instruction. \nIn case studies of math teachers, Freeman and Porter gathered data \nregarding coverage of chapters, lessons, and parts of lessons. 28 On \naverage, the four case study teachers used 58 percent of the chapters in \ntheir texts, with use defined as at least 25 percent of the lessons \ncovered. On average, the teachers simply did not reach 29 percent of \nthe chapters at the end of their texts. They skipped the remaining \nchapters deliberately. 29 It is not easy to compare the math and reading \ninstructional data, but it seems that reading teachers cover chapters or \npages of the basal readers in sequence. From Barr and Dreeben's work \nwe can conclude that teachers do not consistently finish the text with \nevery instructional group in reading. 3Â° In fact, one of the major \ncorrelates of ability grouping in reading is differential content \ncoverage. Not enough data are available, however, to estimate the \nmodal behavior of reading instructors with respect to chapters covered \nin basal readers. \nIn the Freeman and Porter study, the teachers' use of lessons and \nlesson sections was also investigated. 3~ Consistent with the findings at \nthe chapter level, the researchers found wide variation in lesson \ncoverage across the four teachers. On average, about one-third of the \nlessons were used, at least in part, by the teachers. The range covered \nwas 13.2 percent to 60.5 percent. \nFreeman and Porter considered within-lesson use by examining \nfive sections of the textbooks: student exercises, teacher-directed \nsections (e.g., introductory or developmental sections), enrichment, \nreview, and additional practice. They found that when lessons were \nused the teachers utilized sections of the textbooks as follows: student \nexercises in 92.2 percent of those lessons; review sections in 86.3 \npercent; teacher-directed portions in 73.5 percent; enrichment in _56.4 \npercent; and additional practice in 23.6 percent. The researchers noted \nthat the teachers displayed similar patterns in their use of student \nexercises, review activities, and practice problems at the end of the \nbook, while they differed in their tendency to use enrichment and \ndevelopmental (teacher-directed) sections. 32 \nExcept for our own case studies to be presented shortly, we are \nunaware of any systematic data on textbook use in social studies or \nscience. Morrissett reviewed studies that show that textbooks are used \nduring the majority of instructional class time and homework time by \nelementary school social studies pupils. 33 While systematic attention \n", '168 ~S T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  BY T H E  B O O K ?  \nhas been given to the content and composition of social studies \ntextbooks, research targeted at documenting the specific ways they are \nused in classrooms is lacking. \nSUGGESTIONS IN TEACHERTS EDITIONS \nSome researchers have been interested in whether teachers follow \nsuggestions in teacher\'s guides, not just if they use student textbook \ncontent. In reading instruction, the question is not whether basal \ncontent is read but whether the suggested instructional approach is \nfollowed. For example, Durkin investigated the use of basal reading \nseries in first, third, and fifth grades. 34 She found that teachers did use \nthe reading selections in the basals, but did not consistently follow the \ninstructional practices suggested in the manuals. In particular, the \nteachers she studied did not use suggested prereading activities such as \ndevelopment of new vocabulary in context and guiding questions \nprior to student reading of basal selections. However, teachers did use \ncomprehension assessment questions following reading and were \nrather consistent in their use of written exercises such as those dealing \nwith phonics. \nWe have analyzed instructional suggestions in the teacher\'s guides \nof the most widely used math and social studies textbooks for fifth \ngrade. 35 Most guides contain suggestions for activities that are \nconsidered essential (we termed these "core activities") and others that \nfall into an "optional" category. For example, the five most popular \nmath series all expected student practice exercises to be a cornerstone \nof the instructional program. The use of calculators, manipulatives, \ncontests and games generally was optional. In social studies, reading \nthe text and answering questions were deemed core activities while \ngroup projects and field trips typically were optional. This general \ndistinction may partially explain choices teachers make about which \nactivities to include in their instructional program and which to \neliminate, particularly when the teacher\'s own priorities are consonant \nwith those of the text authors. \nThe influence of subject matter is apparent in reviewing the role \nand use of textbooks in classrooms. In the area of reading, the \ntextbook selections are rather consistently used, although as Durkin \ndemonstrated the readings are not always used in the ways suggested \nby teacher\'s manuals. Other investigators of reading instruction have \nalso found that basal content per se is adhered to rather closely. 36 \nWhile it seems true that basal reading series are used in a regular and \n', 'STODOLSKY 169 \nrather comprehensive way, reading may stand as the exception rather \nthan the rule in the realm of textbook use. Variation in textbook use \nby subject matter deserves much more scrutiny than has heretofore \nbeen given to it. \nVery little research has examined textbook use in other subject \nareas, although a study on writing instruction in elementary school by \nBridge and Hiebert widens the scope of existing research. 37 The \npresence of textbooks in classrooms has been documented across most \nfields of study, even though the details of their use have not been \nadequately charted? s Since texts in different fields have distinctive \nfeatures, research on their use needs to be tailored to the specific field \nof interest. Specific features also have to be considered in connection \nwith individual curricula in a given school subject. \nA Study of Textbook Use in Fifth-Grade \nMath and Social Studies Classes \nTo explore further some of these issues and increase our empirical \nbase, we examined textbook use in fifth-grade math and social studies \nclasses through a reanalysis of observational materials collected for \nanother purpose. 39 In all we looked at four math curricula and four \nsocial studies curricula in use by six math and six social studies \nteachers. 4Â° Teachers were in schools that served lower-class, working- \nclass, middle-class, and upper-middle class pupils. The observed \nteachers were experienced; they had taught from six to thirty-six \nyears. In two instances, we observed two teachers in the same school \nusing the same curriculum (teachers A1 and A2 and BI and B2 in \nmath and teachers BI and B2 and C1 and C2 in social studies), while \nthe remaining curricula were each used by only one teacher in our \nsample. In three instances we analyzed both math and social studies \ninstruction provided by the same teacher (BI, B2, and C1). In \naddition we analyzed the instruction of three other teachers in math \n(A1, A2, and D 1) and social studies (C2, El,  F 1). Thus, observations \nof nine teachers were analyzed for current purposes. \nWritten observations of the teachers were made during two \nconsecutive weeks of instruction in midyear. The observation period \nwas not selected on the basis of the content covered, nor was the \noriginal focus of the study textbook use. However, narrative records \nof the classroom activity structure were made during the observation \nperiod and can be used to add to our knowledge about how teachers \nuse textbooks and curriculum packages. 41 However, due to the \n', "170 i s  T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  BY T H E  B O O K ?  \nduration of the observations and some lack of relevant detail in the \nrecords, certain limitations must be acknowledged. \nIn examining instruction in the math and social studies classes we \nconsidered the ways in which the observed teachers used curricular \nmaterials from a number of points of view. Following our earlier \nanalysis, we asked to what extent topics taught were from the book, \nwhat sections of the book or other materials were used, and if the \nsuggestions in teacher's editions were followed. We also considered \nthe specific nature of the materials available to the teacher in assessing \nthe match between instruction and curricula. \nSIX FIFTH-GRADE MATH CLASSES \nOur six teachers exhibited a wide range of postures with respect to \ntextbook use. We saw close adherence to the textbook, extreme \nautonomy from the adopted math textbook, and practices that fell \nbetween. For instance, both teachers (A1 and A2) who used the Scott, \nForesman Mathematics text stayed close to the textbook topics, but one \nskipped over pages on problem solving with fractions and map \nreading. Neither of the two teachers (B1 and B2) who used Exploring \nElementary Mathematics preserved the text topic sequence. Teacher B 1 \ncombined similar content from a number of chapters and skipped \nwhole sections of chapters. Teacher B2 skipped a chapter on geometry \nthat fell between two chapters on operations with fractions and \ncombined material from the two fraction chapters. Teacher CI who \nused Discovery in Mathematics focused most of her instruction on \nmultiplication of fractional numbers and covered the topic in textbook \norder. In addition, she assigned students worksheets which contained \nbasic computational operations such as three-column addition, \npresumably to maintain skills. Last, we observed teacher D1 whose \nclassroom text was Investigating School Mathematics. We never saw him \nuse the textbook during our two weeks of observation, although his \ninstruction dealt with operations with fractions--topics covered in \nchapters 1 1 and 14 of the text. \nAt the very general level of topic, our math teachers behaved much \nas those studied by Freeman and by Freeman and Porter. 42 What was \ntaught was almost always in their books, but most of them skipped \ntopics and chapters and did not necessarily preserve text sequence. Of  \nmore interest is the extent to which the actual contents of the book \nwere in evidence during instruction. \nTo  examine this issue we looked at the various sections found in \nthe student textbook lessons and determined how they were used by \n", 'STODOLSKY 171 \nthe teachers. Each of the four books contained introductory or \ndevelopmental sections and exercise sections. Three of the books \ncontained maintenance, review, and test sections, and two books had \nenrichment material. Table 1 displays each teacher\'s use of each \nsection. \nThe pairs of teachers using the same books (the teachers across the \nhall) provide particularly interesting information. Teachers A1 and \nA2 both made use of the introductory sections in Scott,Foresman \nMathematics. Teacher A 1 did so explicitly with students actively using \nthe text while teacher A2 used the same or similar material but did not \nregularly direct students\' attention to the text section. Both teachers \nskipped word problems that were contained in the introductions and \nhad students deal only with a numerical problem equivalent. For \ninstance, teacher A2 omitted a story in the student text about children \nwho lived different distances from school, a story intended to teach \npupils how to compare the magnitudes of fractions. Instead, she went \ndirectly to the adjacent page on which such problems were presented \nin numerical form and solved them orally with the pupils. Teacher A2 \nalso tended to ignore graphic and figural materials in the developmen- \ntal portion, while teacher A 1 used them occasionally. \nBoth these teachers regularly assigned student exercises from the \ntext as homework or seatwork, but each also made up problems for \nstudents. Neither teacher used the enrichment sections of the textbook \nsuch as "side trips," laboratory exercises, calculator problems, and \ncareers. One made use of a test and the other made use of a main- \ntenance section. Both teachers stayed quite close to the text, particular- \nly teacher A1 who tended to have pupils turn to every text page in \norder. \nTeachers B1 and B2 used Exploring Elementary Mathematics in \ntheir classrooms. These teachers exhibited very different teaching \nstyles and textbook use. Teacher B1, who was teaching equivalent \nfractions, used an actual textbook page on two days of observations. \nOn those days she used a review section for a seatwork assignment \nand one introductory section of the text. She never used student \nexercises, maintenance, or test sections. Instead, she made extensive \nuse of transparencies she prepared to introduce material, and \nworksheets of exercises and problems she created for student practice \nand recitations.

The students in her class spent over half their time in \nteacher-directed lessons. \nTeacher B2 was also teaching operations with fractions. His use of \nthe textbook, however, was very different from his in-school \ncolleague. The only portion of the book used by teacher B2 was the \nstudent exercises which he assigned for both seatwork and homework \nand checked during classtime. He never directed students to any other \nportion of the book; students spent most of their time doing problem \nsets as seatwork. When seatwork exercises were not from the text, \nthey were mostly commercially prepared worksheets that accompa- \nnied the textbook series. It is unclear if teacher B2 ever spent time on \ndevelopmental activities during his classes; he did not do so in the two \nweeks we observed him. \nTeacher C 1 who used Discovery in Mathematics, rather consistently \ndirected her students to the student textbook pages in their order of \noccurrence. With questions directed to the class she used a step-by- \nstep approach in which she included some of the examples provided in \nthe introductory and "oral" section of her textbook. However, she \nalso ignored materials in those sections, particularly questions or \ndiagrams, and primarily rehearsed necessary operations and rules with \nthe class as emphasized in the book. Her seatwork and homework \nassignments were drawn from a variety of sources including exercises \nin the text, exercises in a workbook that accompanies the textbook \nseries, another workbook she used regularly, and commercial dittoes \nthat were frequently in game form from many other publishers. Her \ntext did not contain many diagrams, pictures, and illustrations. It also \nlacked enrichment sections. Teacher Cl \'s  use of other commercial \nsources for student problems may have resulted in part from a need to \nsupplement the book in these areas. \nInvestigating School Mathematics was the official text for teacher D 1 \'s \nclass. However, during our observations he never used the textbook, \nalthough he briefly used an accompanying workbook page once for \neight minutes during a lesson. Teacher D1 structured almost all his \nmath periods as teacher-directed lessons during which he checked \nstudent homework, conducted recitations, and held many contests with \nstudents at the blackboard. When he used worksheets they were \nsometimes commercially prepared, but most of the time he selected \nproblems from a wide variety of resource books or created his own. \nTeacher D 1 expressed a strong conviction that students needed practice \n', '174 IS T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  BY T H E  B O O K .  ) \nand mastery of basic arithmetic operations. Beyond the fact that he did \nnot actually use the textbook adopted by his school, he also departed \nfrom its emphasis on discovery learning. His style and independent \napproach defined him as a teacher following his own beliefs about \nmath teaching. \nWe have already seen that the teachers varied considerably in their \nuse of the textbooks. We must also consider their use of the materials \nin the teacher\'s editions. Teacher A 1, who adhered closely to student \ntext material, incorporated a number of instructional suggestions in \nthe teacher\'s edition--particularly explanations of concepts and skills \nand book terminology. Teacher A2, who was less consistent in her \nuse of the student text than teacher A1, also modified and changed the \npurposes of introductory sections, was more selective in their use, and \ncreated her own explanations of material. Teacher A2 emphasized \ndiagnosis and remediation and therefore spent considerable class time \nassisting individual pupils. The teacher\'s guide contained many \nenrichment and motivational techniques including using manipula- \ntives, and recreational activities such as projects, experiments, games, \ncontests, and the use of the calculator. Teachers A1 and A2 both \nignored the enrichment and motivational material and suggestions. \nTeachers BI and B2 provided contrast in their use of the teacher\'s \nguide to Exploring Elementary Mathematics as they did in student \ntextbook use. The teacher\'s guide itself describes the objectives of the \ntext portion and offers procedures for explanation. Sometimes the \nguide also contains background explanations for the teacher. It does \nnot contain suggestions for enrichment or additional activities for \npupils. Teacher B1 basically handled the materials in her own way. \nShe invented her own methods of explaining procedures and concepts, \nand used instructional strategies she thought effective such as having \n, pupils take notes, recite definitions, and do mental arithmetic. These \napproaches were not suggested in the teacher\'s edition. She also \ndefined terms in her own way. For instance, the teacher\'s edition \nstates: "Reducing to simplest fractional numerals is having only 1 as a \ncommon factor of the numerator and denominator" (p. 225). Teacher \nB1 told her pupils, "Reducing to simplest fractional numerals is to find \nthe largest number you can divide both numerator and denominator." \nAs far as we could tell, teacher B2 completely ignored the suggestions \nin the teacher\'s guide. Since his textbook use was limited to student \nexercises with no use of introductory sections, we infer he was not \ninfluenced by the teacher\'s edition. \nThe teacher\'s guide provided with teacher C l\'s text contains very \n', "STODOLSKY 175 \ndetailed suggestions on using textbook examples and explaining \nconcepts, along with suggested classroom activities. Teacher C1 did \nnot follow the suggestions in the teacher's guide; rather, she \nmaintained her own recitation and seatwork style and produced her \nown explanations and rules for the operations under study. She \nemphasized student repetition of definitions and procedures--a \npractice consistent with the textbook orientation. However, this \npractice may have arisen from her own convictions rather than from \nadoption of the material and suggestions in the guide. \nSince teacher D1 was completely independent of the textbook he \ndid not use its accompanying teacher's edition. \nSummary. The six teachers we observed varied considerably in \ntheir use of student and teacher's editions of their math textbooks. \nOverall, we observed the most agreement between textbook topics \nand instructional topics, although it did not usually extend to \npreserving topical sequence. The least agreement was in the use of the \nsuggested activities in the teacher's editions and actual classroom \npractices. Most of the teachers departed significantly from the \nsuggestions or did not even seem to have considered them in planning \ntheir instruction. \nCertain parts of the textbooks and suggestions seemed dispensable \nto all of our teachers. In particular, manipulative activities and \nsuggestions for enrichment did not find their way into practice during \nour period of observation. This result is consistent with prior \nresearch. 43 On the other hand, four of the six teachers did use student \nexercises for seatwork and homework assignments, although they \nwere supplemented with problems and activities from other sources. \nThe developmental or introductory sections were also used by four \nteachers; in one case, however, the use was very selective and the \ncontent was often modified. Interestingly, the most conformity and \nthe more exclusive use of text content were exhibited by the pair of \nteachers in School A--an upper-middle class suburb with a strong \nmath program directed by a math specialist. The adopted text was \nmore varied in its content and instructional suggestions than some of \nthe others we saw in use, although as we noted the teachers often \nomitted those distinctive activities. While school policy granted \nconsiderable autonomy to teachers in general, there was a \ncommitment to keep to the same schedule of topics in all math classes. \nConsequently, teachers may have felt more constrained to stay with \nprescribed topics and materials than in other school settings. \n", "176 IS T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  BY T H E  B O O K ?  \nTeacher D1 taught in a working-class suburban school, but \nexhibited complete autonomy from the prescribed text. His program \nwas obviously acceptable in the school in which tight central control \nwas present regarding grading, discipline, and educational objectives. \nIn contrast, teachers BI and B2 in another working-class school \ndiffered in teaching styles and textbook use. Teacher BI created \nalmost all her own materials and examples during instruction and \nspent considerable class time actively instructing her pupils. Teacher \nB2 used only student exercises and generally failed to sustain a \ndevelopmentally oriented instructional program. \nIn sum, our cases suggest that teachers are very autonomous in \ntheir textbook use and that it is likely that only a minority of teachers \nreally follow the text in the page-by-page manner suggested in the \nliterature. Use is much more varied than usually suggested, \nparticularly when one considers more than just the topics contained in \nthe books. Even with regard to topics, we found, as Freeman and \nPorter did, that what teachers teach is in the books, but they do not \nteach everything that is in the books. Thus, math textbook content \ntends to place something like a cap on content coverage in classrooms, \nalthough putting something in a book does not guarantee instruction \nwill be devoted to it. \nDevelopers of teacher's editions might be sobered by our findings \nwhich suggest a weak link between their suggestions and actual \nclassroom practices. However, it should be noted that we studied \nhighly experienced teachers. It is perhaps true that written teacher's \neditions are not very effective influences on instructional practices, \nand this may be more true in certain areas of the curriculum. There is \na rather convincing history of a disjunction between math educators' \nvisions of math instruction and what classroom teachers do that \nsuggests math is a domain in which the discrepancy may be \nparticularly large. The omission of the more activity-based aspects of \nthe curriculum by all our teachers is one symptom of this often noted \ndisjunction. \nMost of our students used more than just problem sets in their \nfifth-grade math books. At least occasionally some of our pupils were \ndirected to the developmental portions of the book. In general, \nhowever, their experiences were restricted to written and oral \nactivities that emphasized algorithmic mastery, 44 and did not involve \nmaterials other than paper, pencils, worksheets, textbooks, and the \nblackboard. When this routine was broken, it was to make room for a \nteam contest or game focused on computation. \n", 'S T O D O L S K Y  1 7 7  \nSIX F I F T H - G R A D E  SOCIAL STUDIES CLASSES \nUsing cases from the same database as the math classes, we \nexamined teaching in six social studies classes in a similar manner. \nTeachers B1 and B2 were using Inquiring about American History (the \nHolt data bank system). Teachers C1 and C2 used the text Man and \nSociety. Teacher E1 was using Man: A Course of Study (MACOS) and \nTeacher F1 had adopted a simulation curriculum, Sailing to the New \nWorld. \nOur first analysis focused on the topics taught in the social studies \nclasses and their match with the adopted text or curriculum package. \nIn contrast to math texts, social studies texts do not seem to define the \nmaximum range of topics covered during instruction. While text \ntopics are taught, social studies teachers often conduct additional \nactivities related and unrelated to the textbook or curriculum content. \nIn the case of teachers BI and B2, we saw contrasting styles of \ncurriculum use as we did in their math teaching. Teacher BI made full \nuse of the data bank system having students use the text and data \nsources in their study of the colonies and immigration. She also made \na number of her own worksheets on aspects of government which \nwere topically related to the study unit. Generally speaking, teacher \nB1 stayed close to the topics in the textbook and focused on the \nhistory of the colonial period. \nTeacher B2 only used the textbook portion of the data bank \nsystem. On some observation days, the class was studying the \nRevolutionary period. Teacher B2 used topics in the student text but \ndid not preserve the text sequence. On other days pupils were \noccupied with a map skills book from which they were to learn \nterminology such as "longitude" and "latitude," and how to copy \nmaps. The work on maps did not seem connected to the history \nstudied on adjacent days. \nTeachers C1 and C2 both displayed topical coverage that \nextended beyond and could not be viewed as integrated with text \ntopics. In fact, both teachers had a number of curricular streams going \nsimultaneously. Thus, in a two-week period, teacher Cl \'s  students \nread about ancient and modern cities in their textbook, but also did a \nproblem-solving exercise on immigration using another source, \nlearned the abbreviations for the states, worked on graphing and table \nskills, worked on career project reports and posters, and reported on \ncurrent events. Teacher C2\'s pupils engaged in almost as diverse a set \nof topics which included studying industrialism from the textbook, \nlearning the names of the states, studying fine arts through worksheets \n', '178 I s  T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  B Y  T H E  B O O K .  ) \non composers and dramatists, developing career project reports and \nposters, reading a news weekly about China and Taiwan (current \nevents), and a "goods and services" problem-solving exercise. Both \nthese teachers were equipped with a variety of resources for their \nsocial studies classes. As far as we could tell, topical integration of \nactivities was not regularly sought and coverage went well beyond the \nprimary adopted text. \nOur other two teachers were using innovative curricula, both of \nwhich were structured for small work groups of students engaged in \ncollaborative problem solving. Interestingly, it was teacher El, using \nMACOS, and teacher FI, using Sailing to the New World, who were \nclosest in topical coverage to their adopted curricula. In fact, although \nteacher El did not do all suggested activities in the MACOS unit on \nEskimos, she did not devote any instruction to non-MACOS topics. \nTeacher F I consistently and exclusively followed the simulation \nprogram dealing with preparation for colonization of the new world. \nIn the presence of these curricular programs, the teachers did not \ndevote instruction to other topics. \nTo summarize, three of the teachers (B1, El, and FI)  closely \nadhered to topics in their curriculum packages and materials, but \nsometimes teachers B1 and El were selective as both skipped some \nmaterial. Both also occasionally created their own activities for \nstudents that were consistent with but not contained in their \nprograms. The other three teachers, particularly C I and C2, used \ntheir texts as only one component of their social studies instruction, \nand included various other unrelated topics on the days we observed. \nIn the remaining case (teacher B2) two topical streams--Revolution- \nary history and map skills--were taught, each derived from a separate \nbook. \nWe have already suggested that the teachers used the curricular \nmaterials in a variety of ways. In the Holt data bank system, a student \ntextbook and data masters and data cards, which contain historical and \ntabular information, are provided. The data materials are meant to \nfoster inquiry, concept attainment, and research skills. Teacher B I \ntold us that she liked the variety of materials and the concept approach \nand made full use of the system, assigning students data for individual \nand group .research projects as well as using the text in connection \nwith recitation and discussion. She also used some of the discussion \ntopics suggested in the teacher\'s guide. However, she did not \nincorporate suggested enrichment activities and chose among the data \nmaterials provided. While staying within the spirit of the program, \n', "STODOLSKY 179 \nteacher B1 made some of her Own worksheets and assignments and \nadapted the program to her own style and students. \nTeacher B2 totally dropped the data materials and only used the \ntextbook. In an interview, he stated the curriculum was too broad for \nhis students and that they did not have the background for it. Most of \nhis classes were devoted to lectures, recitations, or seatwork. He \nskipped around in the textbook and his lectures lacked close \nconnection to the text topic. On one occasion he showed a film which \nwas related to the study unit. His recitations tended to emphasize \nstudents' ability to define terms. For a number of days students \nworked individually on map skills from a workbook and were drilled \norally on terminology. They also traced maps from the workbook. \nTeacher B2 did not use the suggestions in the teacher's guide that \naccompanied the data bank system. His instructional approach did not \nseem much affected by the particular materials adopted in his school. \nTeachers CI and C2 both used a wide variety of resources during \ninstruction. Their text, Man and Society, was rather traditional in format \nwith narrative material and some student questions and exercises. Both \nteachers used the textbook and its exercises for a portion of their \ninstructional time, but it was one of a number of materials used in \ninstruction. When in use, the textbook sequence was followed closely, \nalthough both teachers used a recitation format in which students took \nturns reading and then answered questions the teacher posed. Teacher \nC1 tended to ask more complex questions, while teacher C2 usually \nasked factual ones. This classroom procedure did not conform to the \nsuggested activity in the teacher's guide and enrichment and extension \nactivities were ignored. In both classes in school C the striking feature \nof social studies instruction was the diversity of sources used and topics \ncovered. The text did not even appear to be an instructional anchor; it \nwas simply one component of the social studies program. \nWe have already indicated that teachers E1 and F l - - the  users of \nnonconventional curricula--were more faithful to their adopted \nprograms. Teacher El sometimes adapted activities in MACOS, but \ngenerally followed the suggested instructional procedures. We thus \nsaw her pupils in small groups, watching films, putting on a play \nabout Eskimo life, and generally engaged in the program as envisioned \nby its developers. Teacher FI,  who was using Sailing to the New \nWorld, was unveering in her adherence to the suggested procedures for \nthe program. Her students worked in small groups with the sheets and \nother materials supplied in an orderly simulation of preparing to \ncolonize the new world. \n", "180  IS T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  BY T H E  B O O K ?  \nSummary. The topics in social studies books, particularly \ntraditional books meant to be the centerpiece of instruction, do not \nestablish the set of topics to which social studies instruction is directed. \nIn math, one can assume that almost everything taught is in the text \nalthough everything in the text is not taught. In social studies, the \ntopics contained in the book are taught and usually taught in sequence; \nhowever,  distinct and unrelated topical streams are covered \nsimultaneously during instruction. Generally, more than topics in the \ntextbook are the object of instruction in social studies. \nFrom our limited number of cases, we suggest that more \ninnovative curriculum packages may produce stricter adherence to \ncontent and procedure than standard textbooks in social studies. \nInnovative curricula also appear to provide a single and more \nexclusive focus for instruction and are not used in conjunction with \nother topics or content areas. \nThe use of multiple sources during instruction--including \nworkbooks, other texts, newspapers, and films--is more common in \nsocial studies than in math. In the case of standard texts, other \nmaterials usually come from other publishers. Curriculum packages \nsuch as the Holt data bank system or MACOS provide a variety of \ntypes of materials for student use. Nevertheless, when textbooks are in \nuse their narrative contents are used in order and completely. With one \nexception, our teachers did not skip around in the text or eliminate \nsections as we saw them do in math. \nTeachers used more leeway in their teaching techniques and \nstrategies when a standard textbook was adopted than when faced \nwith an innovative program. As was true in math, enrichment \nsuggestions in teacher's guides were ignored rather consistently as \nwere most instructional suggestions. Our teachers used texts in the \nstyles they felt most appropriate for themselves and their students, \nconsistent with general school policies. \nConclusions \nWe have found little evidence in the literature or our case studies to \nsupport the idea that teachers teach strictly by the book. Instead, we \nhave seen variation in practice that seems to result from teachers' own \nconvictions and preferences, the nature of the materials they use, the \nschool context in which they teach, the particular students in their \nclass, and the subject matter and grade level they are teaching. Ball and \n", "SXODO~.SKV 181 \nFeiman-Nemser have shown that student teachers receive conflicting \nadvice about the use of textbooks. 4s \nOur analysis of math and social studies teaching suggests that \nsubject matter is a central determinant of the role of textbooks in \ninstruction, along with the nature of the curriculum materials \nthemselves. Our math teachers behaved very similarly to those studied \nby Porter and Freeman. But our social studies teachers behaved \ndifferently. From the literature we also infer that reading instructors \nmake more comprehensive and ordered use of materials than we saw \nin either math or social studies. \nWith the innovative curricula in social studies as the only \nexception, we found a rather consistent disregard for many of the \nsuggestions in teacher's guides--particularly those dealing with \nenrichment or motivational activities and specific questions and \ndiscussion topics. Teachers frequently made instruction more \ntraditional (teacher-centered) by eliminating suggestions for group \nprojects, for the use of manipulatives and exploratory activities, and \nfor activities focused on higher mental processes. Our experienced \nteachers used their own styles of teaching and did not rely very much \non the guides. As suggested by Graybeal, they tended to use core \nrather than optional suggestions from the teacher's guides. 46 Yet our \nstrict adherents to the innovative curricula in social studies ran \nstudent-centered classrooms as dictated by their programs, reminding \nus that the nature of the program must be considered to judge fidelity. \nA major difference between math and social studies is the extent to \nwhich the textbook content represents the maximal content coverage. \nIn math this seems to be true; in social studies it is usually not true. \nTextbook content is supplemented and complemented routinely in \nsocial studies classes. Supplementation almost never occurs in math \nclasses and probably not in reading classes either. On the other hand, \nwhen the text is in use, topical sequence is usually preserved in social \nstudies. More skipping and departure from text sequence is found in \nmath. \nOur review and analysis suggests a real need for more study of \ntextbook use, particularly in subjects other than the basic areas of \nreading and math. It also suggests that the common wisdom about \ntextbooks pervading instructional decisions and actions must be \ntempered with more deliberate analysis of the specific ways in which \nsuch an assertion is valid and the conditions under which it is true. \nThe popular vision of slavish adherence to texts does not seem \nsupportable and may have arisen in part from overgeneralization of \n", '182 IS T E A C H I N G  REALLY BY THE BOOK. ) \nk n o w l e d g e  abou t  p r i m a r y  read ing  ins t ruct ion.

It is widely believed that math teachers do not reach a noticeable portion of \nchapters near the end of their books. Flanders analyzed new and old content in several \n', '184 i s  T E A C H I N G  R E A L L Y  BY T H E  B OOK.  ) \npublishers\' math series from grade one through algebra. He showed the first chapters in \nthe series were consistently old material (that is, topics covered in the previous year or \nyears) and, according to the authors, was there for review purposes. Flanders found that \n"on average the first half of a grade 1-8 book has 35 percent new conent, whereas the \nsecond half has 60 percent new content" (p. 22). Newer material was frequently not \npresented until the second third of the text and a number of new topics were never \nreached by teachers because they occurred in the end of the book as well.
