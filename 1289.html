The article argues that the demographic \nupheaval caused by World War I, the provisions of the Public Libraries Act \nof 1919, the library-building activity of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, \nand the library employment advocacy of the Central Bureau for the Employment\nof Women completed the feminization of English public librarianship \nduring the first third of the twentieth century. \nkeywords Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, Central Bureau for the Employment \nof Women, county libraries, Fingerpost, Public Libraries Act of 1919, World War I\nIntroduction\nThe occupation tables of the 1921 census of Great Britain show the number of male \nlibrary workers standing at 1310, with the number of female librarians at 832. In just \nten years, not only had the number of people employed in libraries increased dramatically,\nbut so too had the relative number of women. The number of male library \nworkers had reach 2750 by the time of the 1931 census, but the number of women \nworking in libraries had reached 3439.1 This article investigates why the gendered \ndynamics of library work changed so dramatically in the first three decades of the \ntwentieth century, exploring the social, political, and economic catalysts that contributed\nto the numerical feminization of English public librarianship between the \noutbreak of World War I and the census of 1931.\nIn an earlier article, I explored the entry of women into the library workplace in \nthe long nineteenth century, investigating the range of factors which led women to \naccept librarianship as a respectable profession with strong domestic overtones.2 \nThese factors included the provisions of the Public Libraries Acts of 1850 and 1855, \n', '196 STERLING JOSEPH COLEMAN, JR\nwhich limited town councils in terms of what they could offer in the way of salaries \nto library workers. Male library workers were able to find higher rates of remuneration\nin other occupations and slowly but surely created a manpower crisis within \nthe profession. To fill these vacancies, women were increasingly recruited first to \nbecome library apprentices, then library assistants and later librarians, at a time when \novercrowding of traditional female professions narrowed their opportunities for \nrespectable work elsewhere. Crucially, the Langham Place circle and the Society for \nPromoting the Employment of Women (SPEW) fought a far-reaching, multi-faceted \npublic campaign to demonstrate the respectability of library work, drawing on conventional\nclass-based notions of respectability itself, and on the perception of librar-\nies as clean, safe, and domestic environments for women to work in. At the same \ntime, advocates of female librarianship in the public sphere were able to shift the \ndebate from suitability to equality, from physical and mental fitness to work to equal \nrights in the workplace, from the question of being able to perform library work to \nthe issue of being fairly remunerated for performing such work. \nNevertheless, the numbers of women employed in library work remained relativel y \nlow in the nineteenth century, with only very few women able to reach high positions \nin public libraries before the outbreak of World War I. This article therefore takes \nthe story into the twentieth century, arguing that the provisions of the Public Librarie s \nAct of 1919, the library-building activity of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, and \nthe rise of the Central Bureau for the Employment of Women (CBEW) completed \nthe feminization of English public librarianship during the first thirty years of the \ntwentieth century. It does so by analysing British occupation statistics, newspaper \naccounts, Parliamentary debates, CUKT annual reports, feminists’ narratives, legislation,\nand a wide variety of secondary sources, while drawing attention to the profes-\nsional obstacles that English middle- and working-class women confronted as public \nlibrary workers in an increasingly professionalized environment. However, an analysis\nof the feminization of English public librarianship during the twentieth century \nmust begin with the advent of World War I and the social dislocation caused by the \nwartime employment crisis.\nWorld War I\nThe impact of World War I on female employment is well known, and requires only \nbrief summary here. The outbreak of war did not in itself serve as an immediate \ncatalyst for greater female employment opportunities; from 1914 to 1916, Britain \nrelied largely on volunteer manpower to wage war against the Central Powers, allowing\nlife in the workplace at home to remain largely — though clearly not wholly — \nunaffected. The crucial moment for public librarians as for all other occupations \nwas the passage of the Military Service Acts of 1916, which broadened compulsory \nmilitary service to include all able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and \nforty-one. The social impact of this legislation was demographically and occupationally\ndramatic. As men were called upon to serve their country in greater numbers, it \nbecame vitally important for women to assume the work abandoned by men in \nan effort to maintain the nation’s industrial, commercial, and service sectors, and \nthey did so in unprecedented numbers. The Board of Trade reported in July 1914 an \n', '197‘EMINENTLY SUITED TO GIRLS AND WOMEN’\nestimated number of 2,178,100 females employed in industry and in municipal and \ngovernment establishments. By January 1916, the number of females employed in \nthese industries and establishments increased to 2,420,100. By January 1917 that \nnumber rose to 2,724,100, and by the final year of the war that number climaxed at \n2,923,100. By January 1918, then, an estimated 704,000 females had directly replaced \nmales in employment across industrial and municipal sectors.3 At the same time, \nBoard of Trade records suggest that the number of women employed in professional \noccupations rose from an estimated 50,000 in July 1914 to an estimated 100,500 in \nJanuary 1918. The direct replacement of males by females within the aggregate of \nprofessions stood at 22,000, comprising 43 per cent of those employed in July 1914.4 \nKrista Cowman and Louise Jackson have thus observed that the experience of war \nbrought English women opportunities for different and better-paying jobs, rather \nthan the opportunity to participate in paid work for the first time.5 From working \nin munitions factories and mines to serving as operators in tramways and civil \nservants in government offices, English women successfully executed their duties and \nperformed work that had previously been reserved for men. \nIn the field of public librarianship, a shared opinion developed between English \nfemale and male library workers alike that the war had presented a golden opportunity\nfor women to obtain positions within the field and to hold those positions after \nthe war ended. William Charles Berwick Sayers, Chief Librarian of Croydon Public \nLibraries, confessed, \nGirls might be appointed on the understanding that they leave at the end of the war, but \nI think it will be found much more difficult to get rid of them at the end of the war than \nis commonly supposed. The result, may, therefore, be a large influx of women workers \ninto the profession.6 \nA female librarian known only as M. F. wrote:\nOne result of the present disastrous war is the fact that certain doors in various profession \nand trades are being opened to women — doors which would otherwise have long \nremained closed to our sex [. . .] There is unlimited scope to-day for the capable woman \nwith originality, grit and initiative, for already one sees advertisements for women workers\nin all branches of work to fill the places of the men who have gone [. . .] As yet, \nin England, the services of women have not to any great extent been called for, but we \ncannot say what may happen in the near future if some form of compulsory military \ntraining calls out still more of our men [. . .] vacancies in Public Libraries, the staffs of \nwhich have previously been composed entirely of men.7 \nAnother pseudonymous female librarian, ‘A Woman Librarian’, concurred to a \nlimited degree with M. F.’s assessment, but warned that \nwhatever happens, we must not lose sight of the services rendered by the men at the front \n[. . .] When they return to fill the places kept open for them [. . .] we want them to feel \nthat women are better able to work side by side with them each doing whatever is best \nsuited to his or her respective qualifications.8 \nNot everyone agreed with M. F.’s assessment and opportunism, though; Olive E. \nClarke, Librarian of Islington Public Library, admitted it was inevitable that more \n', '198 STERLING JOSEPH COLEMAN, JR\nprofessional opportunities would be available for both men and women on the home \nfront than there had been prior to the war. However, any attempt to replace coldly, \ndeliberately, and permanently those who were mustered into service would break \nevery rule of common decency and fair play.9 M. F. retorted, \nMy point is that in most libraries the men have seen to it that the women have not had \nan opportunity of sharing their ability, and I may add in some cases the women have not \ngrasped the opportunity. The opportunity has now arisen, and I was urging women to be \nsufficiently manlike in their methods to take it.10 \nAs the controversy gathered pace, an anonymous editorial in The Library World \npleaded for calm and reason:\nWe appeal to these ladies to keep hereafter to their own excellent rule. They know and \nrealize that this is not the time to exploit libraries in the interests of women. The circumstances\nof to-day are quite unusual. Large numbers of girls are being employed by librar-\nies as a provisional measure, and amongst these are a few who will undoubtedly become \npermanent library assistants. The majority, however, have neither desire nor aptitude for \nthe office of librarian.11\nThe ‘excellent rule’ referred to here was a tacit yet unwritten gentlemen’s agreement\nbetween male and female library workers during World War I. Women replac-\ning men in public libraries would do so on a temporary basis. Once the men returned \nfrom the war, these temporary library workers would be released and the veterans \nwould regain their former positions. It was a pact that was openly acknowledged \nby both male and female librarians alike. Ernest A. Savage, then Librarian of the \nCoventry Public Library, declared, \nSince the outbreak of war assistants have been appointed on condition that they leave \nwhen the soldiers come back. They can pass into the permanent staff only in place of men \nwho are killed or are disabled or who do not return to indoor occupations.12 \nLikewise, in 1918, Ethel Gerard, Sub-Librarian of the Worthing Public Library, \nacknowledged in her presidential address as the first female president of the Library \nAssistants’ Association that the majority of the workers in public libraries were \nimperfectly trained women and girls, and that their roles as library assistants were \ntemporary at best. However, there were a few of them who would be able to keep \nthose positions and, if given the proper training, could become valued and influential \nworkers.13 \nIt is well known that this gentlemen’s agreement existed not only in the profession \nof public librarianship but also among all the other professions and trades in England. \nIn Women and Work, Gerry Holloway points out that, ‘despite the differing needs \nand desires of women workers, the notion of the male breadwinner with a dependent \nfamily still held hegemonic sway and had been present in the thinking behind all the \nlegislation that had been passed during the war’.14 Nevertheless, there is compelling \nevidence that the gentlemen’s agreement was broken routinely in the realm of public \nlibrarianship. These violations were committed neither by the male nor female library \nworkers implicated on the ground, but by chief librarians and town councils \nwho chose economy over patriotism in their employment and retention practices \n', '199‘EMINENTLY SUITED TO GIRLS AND WOMEN’\nduring and after the war. Writing in the midst of war in 1916, the novelist Beatrice \nHeron-Maxwell observed, \nIn 1915 there were about 3,500 library assistants in Great Britain and Ireland, and of these \n1,500 were women. Since then, to replace the hundreds of men who have voluntarily and \ninvoluntarily deserted these literary post of theirs, more women are needed than can as \nyet be found, though in many libraries, and particularly those of which women are the \nlibrarians, a feminine staff is being sedulously trained by their chiefs.15 \nTwo years later, Harry G. Sureties, Librarian of Shepherd’s Hill Library, acknowledged\nthat the issue of temporary women workers was not unique to librarianship \nbut permeated every business and industry throughout the country. But the conversion\nof temporary workers into permanent ones was largely governed by pure chance, \nand confirming these appointments on the grounds that workers had an elementary \nunderstanding of their duties created dangers against which the profession had to \nbe guarded.16 \nIn 1919 Margaret Reed, an editorialist for Librarian and Book World, indicated \nthat \nQuite a lot of librarians and assistants have found work they liked better, or work that \npaid them more and have left library work — perhaps the war woke them up. But quite \na lot more have refused to come back to their work. The bigger physical life of the army \nhas unsettled them. And in many of these cases women or girls have continued their \nlibrary work or are taking to it.17 \nAlso in 1919, the Council of the Library Assistants’ Association instructed its Honorary\nSecretary, Arthur Webb, Librarian Assistant of Brighton (East Sussex) Library, to \nwrite a letter of protest to the National Association of Local Government Officers to \naddress the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham’s decision to replace its male library \nstaff with a female library staff as a cost-saving measure. The Council argued that if \nequal work was to be required of the female staff then equal compensation should \nhave been provided as well.18 In a retrospective examination of the impact of World \nWar I upon the numerical growth of women within English public librarianship, Miss \nW. M. Thorne, daughter of William Benson Thorne, Librarian at St Bride Foundation \nInstitute, asserted in 1925 that \nIt was the Great War that gave women their opportunity, and I think no one, however \nunwilling he has to admit the capabilities of women, would say that they did not play \ntheir part and prove their worth. It opened up new spheres of employment.19 \nThese statements point to the fact that female temporary library workers were \nwidely being trained and retained by chief librarians to replace the departed male \nlibrary workers on a permanent basis. \nThese indications that the gentlemen’s agreement was very frequently broken are \nconfirmed in the secondary literature on this topic. Alec Ellis asserts:\nAs was stated earlier, in 1914 approximately 30% of the staff of public libraries were \nwomen, the majority being employed as junior and senior assistants, and as branch librarians\n[. . .] The trend to employ women on an accelerated scale did not take place, as has \noften been popularly supposed, after the outbreak of War, but before the War began; \n', '200 STERLING JOSEPH COLEMAN, JR\nand during the following years the movement continued rather than originated, as men \nenlisted in the armed forces and the problem of staffing became acute. Many women \nalready held appointments on the permanent staff of libraries, and were temporarily promoted\nto replace male colleagues; whilst in a large number of instances they were employed \nfor the first time [. . .] In public libraries numerous temporary assistants were transferred \nto the permanent staff after the War had ended, and by 1924 the sexes were evenly \nbalanced, although in individual institutions the position varied considerably.20\nMore recently, Julia Taylor McCain observes that World War I both expanded the \navailable opportunities and exposed their limitations for women. Opportunities were \navailable because there was a shortage of librarians, and many professional male \nlibrarians were drafted into the service of government departments. The limitations \naccompanying these opportunities were exposed when male librarians returned from \nactive duty and were automatically given seniority over better-qualified and more \nexperienced female librarians.21 \nThough seniority was given to veterans over female librarians with library certificates,\nthere is no clear indication that female library workers — even those hired on \na temporary basis — were released from their positions at the rate of their counterparts\nin other traditionally male occupations at that time. The post-war exodus of \nwomen workers from the munitions factories and mines was not duplicated in public \nlibraries. Elizabeth Roberts observes that once the war ended neither the government \nnor the unions, nor the employers, were willing or able to protect women’s jobs — let \nalone increase their employment opportunities.22 Peter Clarke agrees, insisting that \n‘much wartime employment was a transient phenomenon, especially in fields where \nthe intrusion of women had been most shocking and had attracted most publicity’.23 \nIn a field such as librarianship, where the intrusion of women had been neither shocking\nnor attracted much publicity by the time World War I began, the opposite was \ntrue.\nWomen started entering public librarianship with the success of the ‘Manchester \nExperiment’ of 1871, when the Manchester Free Libraries Committee targeted young \nwomen to fill library assistant vacancies through a successful advertising campaign in \nthe local press.24 By 1914, women workers in public libraries were a common sight, \nand because of the nature of library work it was deemed to be a respectable profession\nin which middle- and working-class women could engage. The marriage bar, \nsocial conventions, and legislation such as the Factory Acts of the 1840s and 1850s \nrestricted the presence and work of women in the public sphere for most of the \nnineteenth century. During World War I, women working in factories, mines, and \nnon-conventional places of employment were seen as necessary social evils that were \nno longer necessary or desirable when the war ended. \nIn public libraries, the war did produce a shortage of male librarians. And while \nmen retained many of the senior positions in public libraries during and after the war, \nrank-and-file librarian and library assistant positions were increasingly being assumed \nand retained by women. These sustained gains made by women library workers \nduring World War I built on the pre-war momentum of the numerical feminization \nof English public librarianship. However, in post-war England, it was the passage of \nthe Public Libraries Act of 1919 that consolidated these gains and allowed women to \ntake on positions of increasing seniority within the profession.\n', '201‘EMINENTLY SUITED TO GIRLS AND WOMEN’\nThe Public Libraries Act of 1919\nPaul Sturges asserts that the Public Libraries Act of 1919 was the strongest piece of \npublic library legislation that Britain had ever seen. It came at the end of a seventyyear-old\nstruggle for national public library development and was itself a product of \nthat struggle.25 During the bill’s second reading John Herbert Lewis, the Parliamentary\nSecretary to the Board of Education, offered his rationale for seeking Royal \nAssent for the Public Libraries Bill of 1919: \nThe Board of Education have been receiving most urgent representations, by deputation \nand otherwise, from all parts of the country, from Library authorities, who complain that, \nowing to the limitation of the 1d. rate [Penny Rate], they are wholly unable to pay any \nwar bonuses to their staff. There are many of them who are actually unable to buy any \nnew books. There are some who do not know how to meet the expenses of the current \nyear, and I know of cases in which branch libraries have had to be closed. We ask for a \nSecond Reading of this Bill in order to remove the existing limitation of rate.26 \nThe main opposition to the Public Libraries Bill emerged from three MPs, who \nobjected to its passage for different reasons. Sir John D. Rees, MP for Nottingham, \nEast, opposed the bill on the grounds that it would serve as an additional expense \nupon the ratepayers of England. \nMy right hon. friend on the Front Bench says that the libraries find it difficult to carry \non. The ratepayers find it difficult to carry on too! The ratepayer had two pockets; out \nof one he pays rates, out of the other taxes. Between the two operations his pockets are \nvery nearly empty.27 \nSir John George Butcher, MP for York, opposed passage because he believed that a \nrate limitation should be imposed upon the bill to prevent a council from overburdening\nratepayers with high rates.28 The Right Honourable Sir Frederick G. Banbury, MP \nfor the City of London, objected to the bill’s passage because he believed it was a \ndrain on the public finances:\nMy experience is that public libraries are places where, if the weather is cold, people go \nin and sit down and get warm, while other people go in to read novels. I do not believe, \nspeaking generally, that public libraries have done any good. On the contrary, they have \ndone a great deal of harm, because the books read, as far as my information goes, are \nchiefly sensational novels, which do no good to anybody. Except for spending public \nmoney, I do not see any object in this Bill.29 \nContrary to these objections, the Public Libraries Bill of 1919 achieved Royal Assent \non 23 December 1919 and authorized the council of any county in England or Wales \nto adopt the Public Libraries Acts for the whole or any part of its county.30 More \ncritical to the feminization of English public librarianship, the Public Libraries Act of \n1919 also repealed the Penny Rate, which from 1855 to 1919 served as the sole source \nof government funding for English public library development. \nThe Public Libraries Act of 1855 had allowed municipalities to finance public \nlibraries based upon a rate drawn from a penny on every pound in revenues. Under \nthe Penny Rate, public libraries throughout the cities and large towns of England \nwere able to flourish with a modicum of success. The wealthier and larger a municipality\nwas, the more ratepayers it contained who would pay the Penny Rate and the \n', '202 STERLING JOSEPH COLEMAN, JR\nmore funding a public library received. However, for those towns and counties in \nEngland that were devoid of large populations, the establishment and maintenance of \npublic libraries was a luxury they could ill afford. The Public Libraries Act of 1919 \npermitted the English rural counties to establish local rates and build public libraries \nwhere none had previously existed. From 1850 to 1919, only thirteen rural counties \noperated public libraries, and they did so only through charitable donations from \nphilanthropists such as the Scottish steel magnate Andrew Carnegie and the English \npublisher John Passmore Edwards. From 1919 to 1931, forty-four English rural \ncounties adopted the Public Libraries Act of 1919 and constructed public libraries in \ntheir communities.31\nNow it is true that, during this era, female library workers continued to face discrimination\nin the hiring, retention, and remuneration practices of town and county \ncouncils. For example, in a letter to the editor of The Library Assistant an anonymous \nfemale librarian wrote: \nIt is evident that the ancient city of Winchester does not attach very much importance to \nits public library or to the holder of the office of librarian, or it would not presume to \nadvertise for one who is expected to be ‘experienced’ at the paltry salary of £250 per \nannum. As if this in itself were not bad enough, the advertisement declares that if the \nperson appointed be a woman, it will be £200 only. If the Winchester City Council \nreally cannot — or will not — pay its librarian more than £250, we hope that it will at \nleast have the self-respect to withdraw the objectionable clause with regard to women, \nand, if one should be appointed, pay her the extra £50.32\nAnother female library worker, H. A. Tillie, Librarian of Chiswick Public Library, \nreported that four out of every five advertisements for library assistants boldly stated \nthat only applications from men would be considered. In the competition between \nmen and women for junior posts, men were preferred in nearly every case, though \ntheir educational qualifications may have been lacking.33 \nNevertheless, public library expansion into the counties demonstrably expanded \nopportunities for women to enter gainful employment. Marjorie Peacock, Librarian \nof Wallasey Public Libraries, enthused: \nThe passing of the recent Library Act brings with it the possibility of much development \nin Library work [. . .] certain clauses will result in the establishment of new library areas. \nIt is reasonable to expect, therefore, that there will be a consequent new demand for \nlibrarians [. . .] But, apropos, what are the prospects of women workers?34 \nThorne declared:\nThe number of County Library schemes too, is rapidly increasing, and women are as \nsuitable for the post of County Librarian as men. These schemes, once begun, will never \nend, but will most assuredly extend in all directions so that Assistant County Librarians \nwill be needed. It is up to us to take hold of every slight opportunity that presents itself, \nnot only to improve our own positions, but those of our successors.35 \nOne of the most telling indicators that English women not only were aware of the \nexpansion of public libraries into rural areas but also took advantage of that expansion\nwas noted by the British library historian Thomas Kelly, who observed that the \nlargest growth in the employment of women in public librarianship came between \n', '203‘EMINENTLY SUITED TO GIRLS AND WOMEN’\n1911 and 1931. By 1931, 58.3 per cent of the 3606 staff known to be working in \nmunicipal libraries were female. While the figures for county libraries are not known, \nthe proportion of women in those areas was certainly higher, and by 1935 no fewer \nthan thirty-two public libraries in Britain had female chief librarians.36 Although \nshe acknowledges the inherent difficulties in estimating employment patterns in \npublic libraries at this time, Evelyn Kerslake points to anecdotal evidence for the \nproliferation of female library workers:\nOnce again, no extensive or longitudinal statistical reports exist from which to verify \nactual numbers of women employees, however, reports from the Library Association’s \ncounty library section provide statistical data which occasionally focused on staffing. \nThis is, however, of limited value as, for example, the 1930–31 report shows 190 staff \nemployed in English county library headquarters, but gives no figures for workers in \nbranch libraries [. . .] However, oral history interviews suggest that in the 1940s workers \nin the county library system were predominantly women.37 \nThe Public Libraries Act of 1919 not only expanded the number of public libraries \nthroughout the rural communities of England but also presented an opportunity for \nfemale library workers to fill these emerging positions in large numbers. As a result, \nthe Act directly contributed to the numerical feminization of English public librarianship.\nAt a time when relatively few new municipal libraries were opening, because \nCarnegie shifted his funding to rural public library development, these new library \nsystems were perceived by female library workers as new frontiers for professional \ngrowth, expansion and advancement.38 As K. A. Stockham notes, \nFor the whole of the period between the two world wars, librarians working for county \nauthorities used a different kind of language from their municipal colleagues, for this \nwas an age of adventure and the most commonly used words were pioneer, exploration, \nmissionary.39\n Such rhetoric not only defined the work of county library workers but could also \nhelp enhance the allure of county libraries to women interested in library work. \nCounty library workers were pioneering and missionary in the sense that they were \nbringing library services to rural areas previously devoid of such services. They were \nexploratory in the sense that they were compelled to develop new techniques and \nnew methods of information provision to surmount the environmental and logistical \nchallenges they confronted. This kind of work may have offered female library \nworkers some measure of creativity, freedom, and professional empowerment, which \nwas apparently more likely to be curtailed under a municipal library system.\nHowever, as these new libraries came into existence, a further intervention was \nneeded to buttress the rates imposed by the county council. These rates sometimes \nproved inadequate or insufficient to build a public library, provide competitive \nsalaries to library workers, maintain the services of the public library or develop the \npublic library’s collections. The CUKT intervened to meet this need and by doing so \ncontributed to the numerical feminization of English public librarianship.\nThe Carnegie United Kingdom Trust\nPrior to the creation of the CUKT in 1913, Carnegie donated £1,770,000 to build \npublic libraries supported by councils which adopted the Public Library Acts. Once \n', '204 STERLING JOSEPH COLEMAN, JR\nthe CUKT was established, the organization promised additional grants in the amount \nof £174,970 for the construction of new library buildings, and by 1915 it reached an \noverall expenditure total of nearly £2,000,000 for the erection of public libraries \nthroughout the United Kingdom.40 Because the sheer scope of its task was such \na daunting one, the CUKT formalized the distribution of donations to handle the \nincreasing number of requests from English municipalities. It also increased financial \noutlays to satisfy this rising demand and funded library-related and non-libraryrelated\nbuilding projects on a needs-only basis. In a report that the CUKT commis-\nsioned in 1915 from W. G. S. Adams, the Gladstone Professor of Political Theory and \nInstitutions at Oxford University, it was revealed that: \nRemarkable as has thus been the advance in the population which shares in free public \nlibrary facilities, the fact remains that, the total population of the United Kingdom in 1911 \nbeing returned at 45,370,530, not more than 57 per cent, reside within library areas [. . .] \nThese figures would in themselves suggest what is an outstanding feature of the present \nsituation, the fact that libraries are chiefly in the larger town areas, while the smaller \ntowns and country districts remain to a great extent unprovided for.41 \nFrom 1913 to 1919 the CUKT sought to correct this discrepancy but was able to \nprovide grants for the construction of library buildings in only thirteen English rural \ncounties. With the passage of the Public Libraries Act of 1919, the CUKT accelerated \nits benefactions and spurred public library growth throughout the English rural counties.\nFrom 1920 to 1925, the CUKT set aside £192,000 to be granted to counties \nadopting the Act and launching rural library schemes. Supplementary grants for \nbook purchases amounted to £90,000 and were distributed between 1926 and 1930 to \ncounties which were developing along approved lines.42 \nDuring the 1920s, the CUKT and the British government shared the burden of \npublic library development in the rural counties. In those rural areas where the CUKT \nestablished public libraries prior to the passage of the Public Libraries Act of 1919, \ncounty councils supplemented CUKT benefactions with rates of their choosing, which \nallowed them to preserve and maintain a variety of public library services, expand \ncollection development, hire new library workers, and offer competitive salaries. \nWhile the danger of dependency upon the CUKT did exist, rural county councils \nfound the lure of funding from both the British government and the CUKT too tempting\nto resist. Herbert Lewis, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, \nrealized the precariousness of the rural county councils’ dependency upon CUKT \ngrants when he declared upon the floor of the House of Commons: \nThe reason why these powers [provisions of the Public Libraries Act of 1919] have been \ngiven to county authorities is partly because the Carnegie trustees, who have in their \nhands a very large sum of money, for the purpose of establishing rural libraries, \ncommenced their work in certain counties by establishing libraries at their own expense, \nand undertaking to maintain them for a period of I think, three or five years, as the case \nmay be. It is doubtful whether at the present time the county authority has the power to \ngive an undertaking to carry on these libraries.43 \nEven in those rural areas where county councils established libraries under the \nPublic Libraries Act of 1919 prior to securing grants from the CUKT, rural county \ncouncils still raised rates for acquiring reading materials, meeting staffing needs, and \n', '205‘EMINENTLY SUITED TO GIRLS AND WOMEN’\nmaintaining library facilities until 1925. After funding for new rural public library \nconstruction ended in 1925, the CUKT continued during the next five years to spend \nlarge sums of money on expanding the collections of these libraries.44 The end result \nof this cooperation between the English public and private sector in rural library \nbuilding was twofold: the solidification of a nationwide public library system throughout\nboth the urban and rural areas of England and the numerical feminization of \nEnglish public librarianship. \nWith regard to the former, it must be noted that, between 1915 and 1925, the \nCUKT donated £250,000 to eighty-nine English, Welsh, and Scottish rural counties \nwho had remained without access to a public library service at the outbreak of war \nin 1914.45 With regard to the latter, the new public libraries within these eighty-nine \ncounties created new employment opportunities for women. An anonymous female \nlibrarian observed that county libraries created opportunities for librarians to provide \nrural communities with access to books. In this area women were already playing a \nvery important and significant part by helping to transform the life of the countryside \nthrough literacy.46 However, the increase in the number of female library workers \nin the county public libraries did not go unchallenged. In a letter to the editor of \nThe Library World, the pseudonymous ‘One Who Does Not Aspire To Become A \nCounty Official’ complained:\nIs it really accidental that recent appointments to the office of ‘County’ librarian have \nbeen such as to make one wonder whether the finding of a job for a deserving person \nwho has influence rather than the good of the county ratepayers has not been the chief \nmotive? I do not dare to ask this of the recent appointment of a lady without library \nexperience to take charge of the rural library affairs of one of the Home Counties; but \nI do know that some of the best qualified of our younger librarians, having excellent \npersonality, and one of them at least distinguished military service, were passed over in \nfavour of the amateur.47 \nWith the construction of new libraries which led to new opportunities for female \nlibrary workers and CUKT benefactions which led to well-stocked public libraries, \nthe salaries for female library workers in the counties became comparable to what \nwas being offered in the cities. Kerslake highlights the 1931–32 county library report \nproduced by CUKT, which noted that most English county librarians (thirty-two out \nof forty-four) were paid between £300 and £450 per year. However, five received \nbetween £450 and £500 and another five between £500 and £600. The report also \nnoted that deputy librarians were paid not more than £300, senior assistants not more \nthan £250, and junior assistants a maximum of £150.48 In a separate enquiry, the \nAssociation of Assistant Librarians (AAL) reported in 1931 that for overall municipal \npopulation groups between 50,000 and 75,000 — what one may find comparable for \nan average English county at that time — the chief assistant’s average salary for \na woman was £171, the senior assistant’s average salary for a woman was £128, \nand the junior assistant’s average salary for a woman was £94.49 Yet Kerslake is also \ncareful to point out that, while salaries for female librarians had improved between \nthe AAL’s 1911 report and 1931 report, these salaries remained lamentably low.50\nWhile no exact figures exist for the number of female librarians who served in the \npublic libraries of the English rural counties, it can be inferred from contemporary \nreports and commentary that the CUKT and the Public Libraries Act of 1919 \n', '206 STERLING JOSEPH COLEMAN, JR\ncombined to create both an environment and a perception that public librarianship \nwas expanding the employment opportunities of English women. Another factor \nwhich contributed to this perception was the rise of the CBEW as a worthy successor \nto the SPEW.\nThe Central Bureau for the Employment of Women\nFounded on 10 December 1897 by Louise Hume Creighton, an author of British history\nand the wife of the Bishop of London, Mandell Creighton, the CBEW nation-\nally collected and centralized information on the employment of educated women, \ndistributing this information to as many women as possible.51 From 1897 until 1914, \nthe CBEW helped over 3000 women to find employment in the new and emerging \nprofessions in return for a modest annual fee. With the advent of World War I and \nthe social pressure that conflict placed upon women to replace men in occupations \nand professions on the home front, the demand upon the CBEW’s services expanded \nto the point that it compelled the organization’s leaders to seek financial outlays from \nthe CUKT to meet that demand. For the duration of the war, the CUKT donated \n£5000 annually to the CBEW.52 Viscountess Bryce, a patron of the CBEW, recounted \nthe impact of this funding upon the organization’s services: \nThe gift of the Trustees came exactly at the right moment, for no one could have foreseen \nthe unique demands which the exigency of War was to make upon the Bureau. We were \nthus enabled to extend and strengthen our work at the very moment when pressure was \ngreatest, and when both work and strain on our staff were becoming dangerous. We \nincreased the staff, and took two larger rooms as additional premises. Thus we were able \nto meet with less difficulty the tremendous demands which flowed in from all sides and \nthousands of carefully selected workers were supplied to every sort of Government Office \nand War Society.53 \nBy the end of World War I, the CBEW was annually counselling over 14,000 women \ninto the new professions created by the war and the emerging professions which had \nexisted prior to the conflict.\nAs a contemporary of SPEW, the CBEW had a contentious relationship with its \npredecessor. As Anne Bridger and Ellen Jordan note, even during its early years the \nSPEW resisted being co-opted into the CBEW. The SPEW refused to allow its loan \nfund to be amalgamated with that of the CBEW and rejected a request to become \ninvolved in the CBEW’s plan for incorporation. Nevertheless, the two organizations \nexchanged information on available employment, and the SPEW was prepared to \nconsider candidates proposed by the CBEW for its educational loans.54 \nWhen the feminist periodical The Englishwoman’s Review ceased publication in \n1910, the SPEW’S advocacy of public librarianship was largely silenced. As Bridger \nand Jordan note, the SPEW itself began to move in a new direction four years later:\nDuring 1914 the Committee considered the future direction which the Society would take. \nThey considered that the Employment Register and office bureau were beginning to outlive\ntheir usefulness [. . .] The Society was always careful to maintain its original intention \nto provide financial assistance to its grantees on an interest-free basis; but by the 1920s \nthe focus was changing from facilitating technical training to the provision of loans for \nprofessional qualifications.55 \n', '207‘EMINENTLY SUITED TO GIRLS AND WOMEN’\nThe SPEW’s change in direction created a void in public librarianship advocacy which \nthe CBEW filled when it launched the Fingerpost Career Series in 1898 and Women’s \nEmployment in 1901. These publications successfully continued the work of The \nEnglishwoman’s Review with regard to selling public librarianship as a viable and \nrespectable profession for English women to enter.\nThey also raised the level of female awareness of professional opportunities in \nEnglish public librarianship and provided a realistic assessment of the professional \nrequirements necessary to becoming a successful librarian. For example, in the \nfourth volume of the Fingerpost Career Series, an English librarian, E. Gertrude May, \nadmitted about her profession: \nNow there is no doubt that it is work for which women are in some respects especially \nfitted. Their conscientiousness, reliability and attention to detail are valuable qualities \nin a librarian [. . .] It is work, too, which in itself has a strong attraction for women. \nNevertheless women librarians must still regard themselves in this field as pioneers, willing\nto advance gradually and to contend with many obstacles. They must be prepared \nin the face of difficulties to make themselves thoroughly efficient, to gain the highest \nqualifications, and to co-operate loyally with men in their work. They must be ready to \ndevote themselves whole-heartedly and enthusiastically to the great task that lies before \nthe keepers of the Public Libraries of Great Britain — the task of making the Libraries \nthe powerful educative force that they should be in the community.56 \nMarion Frost, the Librarian and Curator of the Public Library and Museum in \nWorthing, intoned in the fifth volume of the Fingerpost series, \nLibrarianship is eminently suited to girls and women of good education and a literary \ninclination. More recruits to the profession were needed in the near future, due to the \nextension of library work in connection with schools while other educational departments \nwould call more especially for library workers of that nature.57\nIn the very next volume, the CBEW insisted that librarianship was suitable for \nwomen, but even with the proper training competition for vacant positions was stiff. \nIt also counselled that the librarian had to know her reader as well as her books, \nbecause her advice could shape the course of reading for many different people.58 \nDifferent female contributors from different public libraries across England were \nsolicited by the CBEW for these articles. Their observations not only provided periodic\nsnapshots of female employment prospects in English public librarianship, \nbut also provided honest assessments of the professional qualifications that English \nwomen needed to secure before they could become librarians. \nConclusion\nAs in the case of the SPEW, it is not known how many female patrons of the CBEW \nentered public librarianship as a direct result of the organization’s advocacy. What \nis known is that through its advocacy, the Central Bureau directly contributed to \nthe numerical feminization of English public librarianship, intervening at a crucial \nmoment when increasing numbers of women were entering the profession — and \ncontinuing the advocacy work vacated by the Langham Place circle and the SPEW. \nCompulsory conscription introduced as part of the war effort in 1916 had mandated \n', '208 STERLING JOSEPH COLEMAN, JR\nan increase in the number of English women serving as public library workers in \norder to keep the nation’s public libraries open. The Public Libraries Act of 1919 and \nthe CUKT then expanded the reach of public librarianship into the rural counties of \nEngland, thus increasing the number of opportunities for women to become library \nworkers. These factors, coupled with the will and abilities of female library workers \nthemselves, not only allowed them to gain a stable foothold within the profession but \nalso aided increasing numbers of them in reaching the pinnacle of the profession \nas chief librarians. However, these factors also encouraged female library workers \nto agitate for equitable compensation, improvements in working conditions, fairer \nhiring practices, and greater access to professional advancement in rural and urban \nEnglish public libraries.\nNotes\n1 Great Britain Census Office, Census of England & \nWales 1931: Occupation Tables (London: His Majesty’s\nStationery Office, 1934), Table G: ‘Occupa-\ntion of Males and Females at the Censuses of 1921 \nand 1931’, p. 679.
