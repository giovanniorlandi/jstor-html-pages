No. 122., THOUSANDS HOMELESS, """ ], Blocks of Houses Blown up in Attempts, to Check Disastrous Fire, in Atlanta Yesterday Afternoon., Atlanta, Ga., May 22.?Fire that, stalled late yesterday afternoon In an, obscure negro section swept a broad, path through the residental sectiwn, of Atlanta, devastating scores of, blocks and destroying many of the, city\'s finest homes and hundreds of, _ negro houses., Although the flames were not entirely, under control las? night they, had been checked half way through, the exclusive Ponce de Leon avenue, oj-isiT-ir-wt n n/l A ritTinlole t, X^oivictjiv.^; actiiuii aiiu llAfr, believed there was little danger of a, further spread., First estTmates of t*ne damage, placed it at between $2**000,U00 and, $3,000,000. So far as couid be learned,, the only life lost was that of a woman,, who died from shock., .. The fire was confined to the northeastern, part of the city and the only, business houses burned were several, warehouses near Decatur and, Fort Streets- the poirtf. of origin,, i A high wind carried the flames, P northeastward with a speed wlikh, soon outran the efforts of the fire, \' department. Within an hour after the, first alarm the blaze began to assume, the proportions of a conflagra, \\ tion and fire officials called in several, hundred men from the Fort Mc|, Pherson Officers\' Training Camp to, ! aid in the fight. Appeals for help also, brought fire equipment from half a, ( dozen neighboring cities., The dramatic struggle with the, 1 flames reached a climax at nightfall,, when the fire fighters made a stand at, Boulevard place and began dynamit,, ing a wide area to protect the Ponce, I de Leon section. The effort was onTy, partially successful, and an hour later, . the dynamiters had to begin their, [ work over again two blocks beyond, the avenue. A lull in the wind favored, their work and last night they were ^, about holding their own, though {, many still feared that be.\'ore morn?, x v _ n u^, ing me names again wuuiu gum ucuuway, and burn their way through to, the edge of the city., The thousands of homeless were being, cared for last night by a citizen\'s, committee and by the Atlanta Red, Cross Chapter. Most of them were, quartered in public buildings. Many, minor injuries were reported, but officials, said there had been few persons, badly hurt., The fire started in a storage house, on Decatur street, just east of Fort, street, burned , several blocks of, small houses clean, jumped\' over five ,, low brick buildings and a row of ,, small shacks, and then swept on unobstructed, into the better residence ., sections. A large part of the devastation,, however, was in neighborhoods, composed largely of homes ranging, in value from $2,500 to $6,000., Some of the most serious losses, were in the section where dynamite, was used, scores of pretty homes in, \' a comparatively new district of the, city being blown up. The dynamiting, began at Boulevard Place at about 4, o\'clock, but the fighters soon were, driven back., Aided by wide Ponce de Leon avenue, and the slowly dying wind, soli, diers, firemen and private citizens, \' blew up whole blocks of houses., 1, \' vtjdv r?ivc rr.p;, r.LL 1 i ;\\1U *, Lieutenant Governor Hands Primary, Contribution to Auditor Moore., Lieutenant Governor J.

Motley, of Potomac, Alexandria, county, lies in the hospital, in this city, awaiting the result of a j, gash cut in his throat by his own i, hand in an attempt to commit suicide!, on Sunday last., The act was committed while Mr., Motley was sitting on the porch at, his home in Potomac, just before, noon on Sunday. While he has lost, a considerable amount of blood it is, now thought that he will recover unlove, criivinfti imr linfnrf?5<\\"n OCCUrs., The porch where he was sitting was, covered with blood when he was discovered., He is a farmer by occupation, and, about sixty years old and married., He gave as his reason for making, the attempt to end his life that he, was "tired of living.", There will probably be a commission, appointed to determine as to ,, his sanity if he recovers. He is, being treated at the hospital by Dr., M. D.

Ten thousand of these go out, every week. Then too the stamp is, nlaced upon all of the printed matter i, .hat is sent out., Co-operating with this commission, are two million members of the, Christian Endeavor society of the c, United States and two million mem- c, bers of the General Federation of c, Women\'s Clubs of the country to i, say nothing of thousands of banks c, that are giving the food garden pri- I, ner out to patrons. The Rotary i, Clubs of the country, several rail- s, roads, the Women\'s Suffrage League t, of ;? dozen states and the garden \', Club of America are among other t, organizations co.operating with the *, commission with which this paper is *, working. Thus it will be seen that, the. Liberty Bond will get a wonder- *, ful amount of publicity it would c, not otherwise have.

Martin of, conspiracy to tie up American mu__, nitions plants by fomenting strikes, and promoting German propaganda, in the United States adds another, chapter to< our preliminary war, history. Germany\'s U-\'ooats in the, ocean were not the only submcrsibles, she employed. While she was, sending out her undersea pirates to, torpedo the Lusitania anci rtmciuai., vessels she was commissioning secret, agents to attack us on land and, on our own soil. We have laid our, hands on a number of these spies, and conspirators from time to time,, Captain von Rintclen being one of, the most notable., . The evidence in his case, though, very illuminating and conclusive,, was not needed Ao prove the systematic, and wholesale character of, the German\' system of secret warfare, upon us for the last two years., As the Baltimore Sun says, there, never was a more deliberate, audacious, and impudent violation of neu4?>1, jiml territory than was, li ai v, carried on in this country by Ger., man agents for month after month,, with the German and Austrian Embassies, as the centre and inspiration, of the whole business. This conspiracy, was conducted on such a, gigantic scale and its activities were, directed to so many points and assumed, so many phases that it was, almost an incitement to revolution, or insurrection. This attempt by a, foreign government to run this, country in its own interest was responsible, for the unrest, excitement, and antagonism on the part of a, large numbej* of our German population., Our patience misled them as, to our firmness and resolution; they, thought they could torpedo us in, the United States with as much impunity, as they were doing on the, sea., Some of them are still under the, impression, doubtless, that they can, accomplish fsometjung in this country, by plots and conspiracies. But, those who are playing this sort of, game at present will be running a, greater risk than Captain Rintelen, did. We are at war now, and those, who take these chances henceforth, may be "monkeying" with the electric, chair., FLEEING TO CANADA., As was the case during the war, between the states- numbers of men,, eligible for military service are leaving, the United States and taking up, their temporary abode in Canada., During our civil conflict nothing couM, be done by this government after, the refugees reached their objective,, but as England and the United States, arc at present allies, conditions are, different. Canada will, therefore, act, with the United States in regard to, persons who are now fleeing their, country., Hundreds; of young men subject to, draft are attempting to escape by, fleeing the country, the War Department, has discovered., A number of cases in which Americans, of military age attempted to, cross the border into Canada have already, come to the attention of the, War Department. As a result, it is, understood that representations will, bo made to the Dominion authorities, to bar from their territory, all Americans, unable to prove tljeir intention, of returning to this country prior to, the dates for beginning registration, or the. actual drafting -of men. The, same request probably will be made, of Mexico, although that country, as, a neutral, probably will have to refuse., The State Department a?so is considering, the advisability of refusing, passports to those of military age., peeking to Je^ye. the .-.country. It was, m inted out yesterday that the State\', Department is in no vay compelled, to issue passports to all applicant\'s, j, * I, enforcing the vagrant act J, Since preparations for war have j, been in progress in this country the j, authorities of most states have de- ,, termined to make it warm for vag-..\', rants. An art\'cle on this page yes- j, terday told of the "action taken by i, the Legislature of West Virginia in j, order to weed out this class of unde- j, sirables, and similar movements will j, doubtless be inaugurated in the j, mother state. The Gazette also pub- j, lished the vagrant laws of the city i, of Alexandria, and this morning I, | three persons?two males and one, I female?were facing the bar of the, Police Court to answer the charge of, vagrancy., I, The first individual arraigned was, r an old offender. It was stated by, the officer who made the arrest that, the defendant had been drunk on the, streets three times in two weeks,, and that he had a decided aversion, to work. He was sent to jail for, three months, subject to conscription, | for work on the public roads., [ The second delinquent wa sa young, ! man who was charged with vag, j rancy. It being the first time lie, I had faced the court to answer such, a charge, he was given one hour in, which to obtain employment. Should, he fail to do so, he will be rearrested, and summarily dealt with., The third person against whom, such a charge was urged is a woman., It was alleged that she had been, conducting a disorderly house on, west Duke street, and that it is a, resort for certain young men. It was, also stated that visitors to the house, come from Washington in automo., . biles. The woman was given twentyfour, hours in which to shake the, dust of the city., WILL REWRITE THE BIBLE., I, I The arroirance of some Germans, produces smiles among people of, other nations. The Teutons having for, | many years been taught that the Germanic, race is a superior product of, the handiwork of the Creator, like, our misguided mother Eve, they, would be as the gods,, i According to the newspaper Kreuzzeitung,, of Berlin, the Germans are, going to rewrite the Bible. The, ; article says:, "If any further proof were needed, of the immeasurable superiority of, the Germans, intellectually and morally,, over the rest of mankind, it is, to be found in the mental attitude of, our people toward the Bible as compared, with that of. other nations., "The English regard that book as, their most valuable commercial asset,, and use it mainly as a form of, v.ovfoT- M-JtVi csivncrp trihps for their, ! good will, the\'r assistance, and the, I, I supply of their natural products, and, ! in England itself it is exploited solej, ly in the propagation of that spirit, of hypocrisy which has stood the, | British in such good stead for ages, i to hoodwink and despoil other races., | <;It must be one of our first tasks, ! on the conclusion of this war, when, ; Germany shall ar\'se out of it reI, newed in power and vitality like an., other phoenix to set a hoard of qual!, ified experts to work to oroduce, not, ! only for our own benefit, but also, | for the moral uplifting of mankind, a, new. a more glorious, a purer Bible,, instinct with the German spirit of, Kulter and morality ., FEARFUL CON FLAG It ATION., Seventy-five blocks of buildings, were destroyed by fire in Atlanta,, Ga.. yesterday before the flames had, been placed under control. Ten, thousand persons are now homeless,, many having lost all their possessions., It was necessary to resort to, dynamite in order to check the conj, flgration, and blocks of fine rcsidoni, ces were destroyed by the explosive., In many cases it was impossible to, save anv of the contents of homes., It is said that the flames spread, j from block to block about as fast as, a man walks, a high w?nd baffling, | the efforts of the firemen, to subdue, j them The property loss is estimated, j at between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000., !
