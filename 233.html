Actual co\n\' operation among all the existing fed\neral. state, county, and municipal\nagencies, together with sympathetic\nassistance from all private corpora\ntions and individuals, will alone pre\ni vent serious losses to stock and bu\n; man deaths. Already in two years\nI over thirty people in California have\nsuffered the terrible death from this\ndisease. Steps have been taken by\nthe states of California, Oregon, Ne\nvada, Idaho and Utah, to obtain as\nsistance from the several federal ser\nI vicc-3 especially interested. If these\n[ efforts to obtain federal Help are to be\nj successful it will be necessary to show\nthat the various slate governments\nand the citizens of these stales are\n! doing their part in helping to eradi\nI cate this disease.\nYou are a stockman, and your in\ni terests are affected in several wayB?\nj your stock, the employees that look\nafter your stock, your family and your\ni Belt. All of these are in danger of bn\n[ coming infected if efforts at the sup\n| presslon ol the disease are not imme\n\' diately undertaken. If stock are in\nk fected they will Burely die. if people\n[ are infected some will surely die, jjp\n[ the treatment is not always success\nI ful in preventing the disease. Some\nof yours may be among the unsucceb-j\nk ful ones. Will you do your share in\ni protecting your own?\n* In this disease the greatest danger\n\' to stock is from the coyote. The\ni greatest to the people iu from the\nI dog. The denser the population and\nI the" greater the number of dogs or\ncoyotes in any community the greater\ni is the danger if the disease once ap\nI pears in that community.

C., March 1.?\nRepregpD\' Stone of Illinois,\nKerns of Colorado, Flood of Virginia,\nSpeaker Clara ana ivitcnin of North\nCarolina, held a long conference with\nPresident Wilson this morning dis\ncussing the submarine warfare case.\nThe president is extremely anxious to\nsecure the backing of congress and is\nconvinced that the result will be dis\nastrous if this support is not secured.\nThe president told his conferees that\nthe government\'s policy was menaced\nby the belief circulated abroad that\nthe country was not behind the ad\nministration.\nHe intimated that Ambassador Von\nBernBtorff, influenced by the recent\nagitation in congress, had convinced\nthe German government that she\ncould safely decline to meet the views\nof the administration.\nRepresentative Henry D. Flood, fol\nlowing the conference, declared that\n"Congress will support the president.\n"The House committee on foreign\naffairs will prepare a resolution today\nendorsing the president. It will be re\nported under the special rule permitt\ning immediate discussion.\n"1 am certain that the resolution\nwill pass the house."\nWASHINGTON, March 1. 4 p. m.rr\nIt is probable that congress will not\nact on the resolution today, as this is\ncalender Wednesday.\nOpinion in the house is so divided\non the international situation that a\nseries of conferences are certain be\nfore any definate plan can be decided\nupon.\nMany members are demanding a\n! blanket endorsement of the president\'s\n; policies, while others are Insisting that\n| the resolution shall be limited to an\n| endorsement of the administration\'s\n| policy in regard to the submarine war\nfare situation.\nThe leaders in both houses appear\nto welcome any parliamentary ob\n| stacles that will delay immediate ac\nj lion.\nWASHINGTON. March 1.?It is un\nderstood that Germany\'s latest assur\n] ances in regard to her submarine\npolicy is not so broad as the United\nStates desires, but no further steps\nwill be taken until the administration\nis assured it will not be embarassed\nby any contrary action of congress.\nThe house committee on foreign af\nj fuirs went into session at 3 o\'clock\nthis afternoon. This situation, where\nthe president asks a vote of confi\ndence from the house, is unparalled in\nthe history of the United States. It\nis unlikely that any decision will be\nreached today.\nCALIFORNIA S\nGETTING HEAVY RAINS\nBy Pac. and Int\'l News Service,\nSAN FRANCISCO, Murch 1.?Th<\nweather forecast this morning wai\n"unsettled; showers tonight ant\nThursday; strong southweBt wind."\nThere is a heavy storm centei\nover the Oregon coast.

She will be featured in "Fan\nchon the Cricket," at the Bradley\nOpera House tonight:\nAll doubt concerning me future af\nfiliations of Mary PtcKtord was per\nmanently dispelled recently by the an\nnouncement that sue has decided to\nremain with the Famous Players Film\ncompany, the first feature organiza\ntion with which she was Identified.\nThe new agreement Into which Miss\nPlckford has entered with Adolph Zu\nkor, president of the Famous Players\ncompany, includes the formation of\nthe Famous Plapers-Mary Plckford\ncompany for the making of feature\nproductions in which Miss Plckford is\nto be etaired, and in which the star\nretains a half interest..\nThe story of Mary Plckford has no\nparallel in the history of the theatre\nor of the screen. A young girl in her\nearly twenties, she has amassed a\nfortune, and is today the highest paid\nwoman in the picture world. Large as\nthe salaries which are paid successful\nactors and actresses are known to be,\nthere has never been a player whose\ncompensation approached that of this\nlittle golden-haired star.\nMr. Zukor, In discussing the new ar\nrangement with Miss Plckford, de\nclared that the formation of the new\ncompany enabled him to carry out sev\neral big projects which he contemplat\ned for the coming year.\n"Miss Plckford Is unquestionably\nthe most popular screen artiBte today,\nbut I do not by any means believe that\nshe has reached the pinnacle of her\nfame. Her wonderful work in such\nwidely different films as "Tees."\n"Madame Butterfly," "The Foundling,"\nand some of her other recent produc\ntions, proves conclusively that Miss\nPlckford, superb as she has been, is\nsteadily improving her artistry."\no .\nEXPLOSION ON BOARD\nBATTLESHIP NEVADA\nBy Pac. and Int\'A News Service.\nBOSTON, March 1.?An explosion\nof a compressed air Lank on board\nthe battleship Nevada, An the Fore\nRiver yardB today injured three men,\none seriously.\nThe Nevada is a sister ship of the\nOklahoma and is next to the Pennsyl\nvania, the greatest drCadnaught\nafloat.\na\nTHINK GERMAN8\nOREAD U.

So desperate a\nmove by the Kiel Fleet would be con\ncelvable in either of two events; a\nfresh bid by the German armieB foi\nthe Channel ports, or a declaration ol\nl war by the United States.\n| German naval critics bave noted\nwith a good deal of anxiety. President\nWilson\'s recent declaration that the\nAmerican battle fleet was nevei\nBtronger nor better organized thai\n5 now and they evidently fear that if ?\ni junction were affected between the\n1 British and American fleets this com\nblned force could dominate not onlj\nr the North Sea, but the Baltic as well\nj and link up a few months hence witl\n. the Russian battle fleet.\n> For Germany therefore to anticlpat<\nBuch a junction by an offensive strok*\n5 would be Imperative. It would be i\nt case of now or never.\nI The vlow that with the assistant\nof France\'s dreadnought stjuadroni\nwhich do not appear to be needed li\nthe Mediterranean, England shouh\nlong ago have entered the Baltic nn<\nII forced the German fleet to come ou\nf by shelling the moro exposed of Get\n>? many\'s coast towns is widely hel<\ni- amongst British naval men.

Russell\nEditor* and Proprietor*\nEvery Afternoon Except Sunday\nSubecrlption Price One Year By Mall SS.00\nEntered at the Elko poatofflce for transmission through the malls as second\nclass matter\nSome people are of such email intel\nlectual calibre that they can never\nlearn that it Is impossible to exalt\nthemselves by trying to defame and\nmalign others. Such are to be pitied,\nrather than censured, for they reap\nthe crops they sow. This is evidenced !\nin an unhappy, envious individual who |\ndivides hi3 time in throwing mud at:\nthe Independent, and calamity howling j\nat a time when the country is enjoying\nthe most prosperous era in its history, j\nPerhaps there is personal reason for j\nthe wail of distress, but the fact that\nnone of the mud hit the intended mark\nis evidenced in the fact that the In-1\ndependent has continued to grow aud\nprosper until its sworn circulation is\nfour time* as large as it was a year\nago, and it is twice as large as any\nother daily paper in Eastern Nevada.\nIn the Reno Journal of this morning\nis a long article relative to Senator\nPittman\'s bill granting 7,000,000 acres\nof land to Nevada for school purposes\nand the reply of the Senator to a\nvicious newspaper attack on the bill.\nAfter assuming that Senator Pittman\'s\nreply was leveled at the Journal, much\nexplanation is offered to show that\nthat paper is in favor of the passage j\nof the measure. This gives rise to a\nvery amusing situation which has\nlocal interest. Another paper has as\nsumed that the Senator\'s reply was\nleveled at it! Ye Gods, what next?\nIt looks like a case of two very guilty\nconsciences.\nNo real newspaper attempts to color\nits news items to harmonize with its\neditorial policy. For instance, our\nsympathies are with Servia, and we\nwould favor the policy of restoring\nthat country to peace with all her for\nmer possessions, still if in our daily\ntelegraph it were announced that\nServia had surrendered and laid down\nher arms, we would publish the fact\nas a matter of news to which the pub\nlic would be entitled. While our sym\npathies and policy would in no wise\nbe affected, some designing nincom\npoop would probably try to make it\nappear to the contrary. Such tactics\nhowever, never mislead the public.\nMODE8TY\nAND LAW.\nCapt. W. M. Meyers of the Virginia\nlegislature introduced an amendment\nto a bill on public morals, reading as\nfollows:\n"That no female shall appear in\npublic within this Commonwealth with\na skirt which does not reach within\nfour incheB of the ground, with a wa\'.st\nor bodice which exposes more thun\nthree inches of the chest or back and\nthat no transparent skirt shall be\nworn."\n"Mr. Speaker," said Capt. Meyers, in\ndefense of his amendment, "complete\nnudity is more decent than the sil\nhouettes one sees in the summer time\nwhen the women walk up and down\nthe streets of this city. Nudity would\ndisgust, while the silhouettes corrupt\nand destroy public morals."\nThe amendment was voted down.\nSumptuary legislation of any sort is\nusually a Joke and never successful.\n* AIbo, any new style is likely to cause\nattention to the human form, malo or\nfemale, for a brief space until the eye\ngrows used to it. Long skirts are just\nr.o "Immodest" after a period of short\nones as low necks after a collar period.\nGranted that the silhouette skirts\nwere worn only by very silly women,\nand that the men of Virginia need pro\ntection from such silliness, there is\nlikely to be more help from the Feder\nation of Women\'s Clubs which is soon\nto start out a vigorous campaign for\nclothing which Is "artistic instead of\nspectacular" than in any prohibitive\nlegislation. Instead of banding any\nparticular style, the women\'s clubs\nwill promulgate principles of beautiful\nand sensible clothing. This is con\nstructive and comeB from the right\nquarter.\nTHE GREAT\nCI VILIZER.\nWhat Europe needs is baseball.\nThis conviction In driven home by\nProfessor Taft\'s speech delivered on\nthe fortieth anniversary of the Na\ntional League of Professional Uaseball\nClubs.\nWhen the ex-president was govor\nnorgenoral of tho Philippines, he ex\nplains, he recognized the need of some\ncivilizing and unifying influence\namong the natives. They were an un\nregenerate lot, with their tribal feuds,\ntheir piracy and border raids and their\nincessant rebellion againnt the govern\ning power. The Igorrotes were the\nworst of all, because of their penchant\nfor head-hunting.\nSo Governor-General Taft, after mn\nture reflection, introduced the Amarl\ncan game of baseball. It was an utter\nnovelty in the Philippines, as it is yet\nIn most parts of the world. And the\nnatives took to it with amazing fw\nclllty. The wild mountain tribes de\nveloped such Interest in tho sport thai\ntheir marauding expeditions ceased\nThe Igorrotes, In their zeal for batting\nand chasing the sphere, lost their taste\nfor cutting off the heads of people\nthey disliked. Soon the islands were\nfull of "fans," and in some cases old\nracial and tribal feuds were fought\nout in baseball tournaments. Where\never the great American sport came\nin, the blood-lust went out.\nThis seems to account, in part at\nleast, for our own\' love of peace. We\nwork off our belligerency at baseball\ngames. When our team winB, we fell\nthat we have won our "place in the\n?un." Whe nit loses, we yell "kill the\numpire!" and thus satisfy our mur\nderous propensities.\nIt\'s plain enough that Professor\nTaft ought to be Bent to introduce the\nnational game in Europe, particularly\nin Germany, Austria and the Balkans.\nMORE REA30NS\nFOR MORE 8HIP8.\nGermany\'s threat to treat all armed\nmerchantmen as warships, and attack\nthem without warning, adds new zest\nto the movement for adequate mer\nchant marine. It is evident that, if\nGreat Britain and her allies refuse to\ntake the guns off their commercial\nvessels, and Germany carries out her\npurpose, there will be no safety at sea\nfor American property or life except\non neutral ships. And as everybody\nI knows, the supply of such craft is far\nI too small to take care of our big\nforeign commerce.\nOur own merchant fleet Is growing\nsteadily, but not rapidly enough.\nAmerican capitalists still hesitate to\nInveBt money in ocean shipping. And\nyet, as William D. Macy of the New\nYork and Cuba Mail Steamship Com\npany points out, conditions are now\ntremendously in favor of Americans\ngoing into the shipping business.\n"The war has brought the price of\nlabor in Europe up to the American\nstandard," he says, "and we can there\nfore build ships at approximately the\nsame cost as the Europeans can." As\na matter of fact, all our shipyards are\nnow busy with building orders; but\nwe ought to have more shipyards?\nand then more orders.\nEDISON\nON ALCOHOL.\nThomas A. Edison, who besides be\ning our greatest inventor is probably\nAmerica\'s leading -sage, took occasion\non his sixty-ninth birthday to solve the\nliquor problem.\nHe is against alcohol on principle,\nbecause as a scientist Interested lu ef\nficiency he has become convinced\nfrom careful observation that it keeps\nmen from doing their best work. Dut\nhe isn\'t fanatical about it. He recog\nnizes the weaknesses and limitations\nof the human animal. And so, while\nhe believeB in prohibition as the ulti\nmate goal, and believes that the whole\nworld is swinging toward it, he would\nnot try- to force matters by harsh\nmeasures. He would taper off grad\nually.\n"You can\'t take alcohol away from\nman all at once," he says. "If you do,\nhe\'ll resent it. Deer has about 4 per\ncent of alcohol. Cut down the per\ncentage to 2 or 1% percent. Let men\ndrink that for twenty years, and then\ncut it down to 1 per cenL Cut out all\nwhisky and strong alcoholic drinks nl\nonce."\nHis plan Is based on the theory thai\nevery man\'s stomach is about the\nsame Bize, and that beer with 2 per\ncent alcohol won\'t make a man drunk\nbecause he can\'t get enough of It intc\nhis stomach at once. "A man gelt\nmerry on a little alcohol, but more\nmakes him ugly. Cut down the al\ncohol, and he will not get ugly." Ant\nwhen he has become reconciled to<the\nmilder beverage, and lost his craving\n1 twould be an easy and natural transl\nHon to teetotallsm.\n"STUDY TRU8T"\nAT ANNAPOLIS.\nThe reason for the recent failure ol\none-fourth of the midshipmen at An\nnapollB to pass their mid-year exami\nnations has been explained. And it\'i\na ueer explanation. The middies, 1\nappears, had organized a "stud]\ntrust," an Institution which, thougl\nnot In contravention of the Shermai\nlaw, was a plain Infringement of pa\ntriotlc obligation.\nIt appears that the demand for i\n? larger navy which arose last year con\nvlnced the middies that they wouli\nall be needed as officers, that Un?li\n8am simply couldn\'t do without then\nand would have to give them commit\nstone no matter how their recordi\nstood. An old and discredited Instl\ntutlon, the "study trust," reappeared\nand proceeded to discourage all hari\nstudy. If a midshipman labored cor\nBcientlously, the idlers found means t<\nmake life no disagreeable for him tha\n\' he usually foil Into line. Thus tin\nscholarship of the academy was sadl;\n> lowered.\nBut the boys reckoned without thol\n- host. Capt. Eberle had taken chargt\n1 as superintendent, and he proceeds\n. to run the academy "Just as he ha<\n? . . . . , .. .\ncommanded bottle#hJpa." Even while\nthe middles were relaxing their ef\nfort*. be wu ordering Instructors to\ntighten their requirements. Hence\nthe slaughter In the January examina\ntions, and the expulsion or 82 men\nfrom the.academy.\nIt was aaalutary leseoh.

It is\nimpossible that he should ever find\nhimself in water beyond hie depth.\nTime and money spent In learning the\nart of swimming are therefore sheer\nwaste?just as much so as If spent in\nmilitary training. Obviously there is\nno more chance of a man\'s being\ndrowned than there is of having to\nfight for his country\'-"\nIt sounds ridiculous enough?as the\nSun meant that it should. Out there\nare people who talk just as ridiculous\nly about military preparedness.\nIf there is any class of Americans\nmore absurd than the jingoes who\nclamor for the biggest army and navy\nin the world, It\'s the pacifists who are\nso perfectly sure that there will never\nagain be any need of fighting for our\ncountry.\nWHY BE A PRE8IDENT?\nI Mike Gibbons has earned $100,000\nin three years in the ring. He got\nabout $170 a second for his less-than\na minute knockout over Young Ahearn.\nTod Sloan earned nearly $1,000,000\nin one year as a jockey.\nChristy Mathewson has amassed a\nfortune of $300,000 through his con\nnection with baeeball.\nJess Willard hasn\'t been champion\na year, yet he has earned about $250,\n000, working on an average of two\nhours per day.\nWhile, on the other mitt, we find\nWoodrow Wilson laboring eight, ten,\ntwelve, and sometimes 14 hours a day\nfor a paltry $75,000!\no\nNOTICE FOR PUBLICATION?\nISLOLATED TRACT\nPublic Land Sale.

The officer ap\n\' peared to believe me, and told a Mag-;\nyar soldier to take me to the. staff of\nthe regiment for examination.\n? "When the guard and I reached the |\nI depths of the enemy\'s positions he\nasked me for a match, which I readily\n1 gave him as I had a box in my pocket. ;\n| He ordered me to stop, and I obeyed.\n| He then leant his rifle against a tree\n! and taking a pipe and tobacco out of\nj his pocket, struck a light. It was still\n! quite dark and taking my chance, with\n; my left hand 1 grasped the rifle, while\n. with my right I made a gesture as if I\nj intended to blow my nose. With a\nviolent swing I struck the man on the\nhead with the butt-end of the rifle and\n? he fell down without even uttering a\ncry.\nj "Having satisfied myself that the\nMagyar was dead, I took off his dis\ns tingutehed conduct medal and search\n! ed his pockets, where I found a book,\nfrom which It appeared that he had\nbeen a teacher in a Lemberg school.\nDragging the body to the nearest ditch\n????\n1 laid it down beside the rifle, and\n: continued my course towards the\n; bridges which I was to blow up.\n"I wandered about for the rest of\nj the night, and when it became too\n! lighl to go on I lay down in some\n? vegetable beds behind the ruins of a\nj peasant\'s hut. From here I was able\nt to observe the country, and to find j\n;-out from the way which I carried the\nplaces where the bridges would most\nprobably be. Having spent the day in\nthis position, i renewed my wander\nings at the fall of darkness. I reached\nthe first bridge, and saw the sentry\nj with his rifle. On seeing me the sen\ntry called out, \'Wey Komrat?\'\n"Instead of giving him an answer I\n( ran up to the bridge and threw four\nhands grenades one after the other.\nThey were well aimed and the bridge\nwith the sentry was blown into the\nair. The body fell into the river and!\nj the bridge began to burn.\n"Not losing a moment, I ran on to\nthe next bridge, which lay half n mile\n| distant. The sentry was standing and\nstaring at the burning bridge, without\npaying any attention to nte. As 1 ap\nproached I flung a grenade at a dis\ntance of fifteen paces. It struck the\n! man\'s feet and both his legs were torn\n? off by the explosion. Then I quickly\ndrew the remaining four grenades and\nI the bridge collapsed and began burn\n! ing.\n"My task was accomplished and I\nran away* as fast as I could and\nj reached the destroyed hut where I had\n[spent the previous day. Soon I heard\nI an alarm, which had been raised to\n: catch me. Men or horseback fired and\ngalloped In search of me, but luckily\nthey just missed me, and presently\nthey disappeared In the distance. An\nhour after this uproar I crept out of\nmy hiding-place and eventually reach\ncd the spot where I was first stopped.\nThis time, however, I managed to slip\npast unnoticed, and continuing on all\nfours I soon got within our lines again.\nI was taken to the staff, my exploit,\nwas verified, and I received the St. i\nGeorge\'s Cross of the third degree." 1\nHOW THE TWO MEN COMPARE.\nHere are the comparative measure\nments of Jess Willard and Frank\nMoran, billed to fight 10 rounds In\nNew York on March 25th.\nWillard: Age 29, height 6 ft. 7 in.,\nweight 247, reach 83% in., chest, nor\nmal 40 in., chest, expanded 44% in.,\nwaist 37 in., biceps, normal 14 in., bi\nceps, riexed 15% in., neck 17% in.,\nwrist 8% in., calf 17%in? ankle 9%\nin.\nMoran: Age 28, height 6 ft. 1 in.,\nweight 203. reach 78% in., chest, nor\nmal 42 in., chest, expanded 46 in.,\nwaist 35 in., biceps, normal 15 in., bi\ni cepts, flexed 16% in., neck 19 in., |\n! wrist 9 in., calf 15% in., ankle 10% in.\nWillard\'s weight and measurements\nj are of the day he fought Jack John\nson.

Fut very brief\ny, this is the why and wherefore of\nhe advance in gasoline prices. It is\n:he working of the inevitable law of\nsupply and demand. In California oil\nfields last year, there was an actual\nfalling off in crude oil production of\nover 14,000.000 barrels. The United\nStates Geological Survey shows that\nthe total 1915 production of crude oil\nIncreased only .6 of 1 per cent over\nthat of the previous year. And yet\n500,000 automobiles were put into use\nin the -United States in 1915 and in\ncreased the gasoline consumption, for\nautomobile alone, fully 27 percent over\nthe consumption in 1914. Meanwhile\nthousands of gasoline engines and\ntractors are being put into service on\nour farms and ranches and depleting\nthe available gasoline supply.\nThe January issue of the National\nPetroleum News?the organ of the In\ndependent Producers?estimates that\nat least a half million new automo\nbiles and trucks will be sold this sea\nson so that in a few months not less\nthan three million cars will be con\nsuming gasoline. That will require a\n30 percent increase in gasoline pro\nduction in order to maintain even the\npresent balance between supply and\ndemand.\nThus far tills year production has\nrun considerably less than nonnal.\nJust as was the case last year the\nUnited States government suits t\nagainst operators on unpatented lands t\nis greatly limiting production and the \'j\nsevere January storms which wrecked i 1\nhundreds of rigs In the California *\nfields has further retarded produc- <\ntlon. \' The California State ^diueralog- <\n1st estimated a daily average 1oj? in <\nproduction of 40,000 barrels as a re- "\nsuit of this storm damage. *\nimproved carburetors and Improved 1\nmethods of refining petroleum will un- \'\ndoubtedly relieve the gasoline situa- (\ntlon fro mtime to time, but in the 1\nfinal analysis the price of gasoline i\nwill be determined by the way the\ncountry\'s crude oil supply keeps up\nwith the ever-growing demand for\ngasoline. Just at present nature and\nthe government are combining to\nlimit the supply. Time amy change\nall this and in the meantime we of the\nPacific Coast can congratulate our\nselvy that we live handy to the Cali\nfornia fields where oil is still flowing\nfast and where we get prices that are\nstill several cents a gallon below ^he\nEastern average.\n?\nNOTICE.\nIn the District Court of the fourth\nJudicial District of the State of\nNevada, In and for the ounty of\nElko.\nNotice is hereby given that the com\nIn the matter of J.
