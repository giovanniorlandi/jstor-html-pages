        <pre>['1992 NOBEL PRIZE FOR PHYSICS\nWire Chambers for Exploring the \nElementary Constituents of Matter\nW. Bartl and M. Regler of the Institute of High Energy Physics, Vienna, Austria, discuss \nthe 1992 Nobel Prize in Physics that was awarded to Georges Charpak for his invention \nand development of particle detectors, in particular the multiwire proportional chamber.\nFig. 1 — Multiwire propor\xad\ntional chamber: a, upper left) \nThe basic structure showing \nthe plane array of parallel \nanode wires placed between \ntwo planar cathodes separated \nby a gas-filled volume ; b, \nupper right) Equipotential and \nfield lines; c, lower) After a \ncharged particle has trans- \nversed showing the initial ion\xad\nization and the subsequent \ndrop-like avalanche that devel\xad\nops around an anode wire.\nGeorges Charpak’s principle invention is \nthe wire chamber, a detector consisting of \nan unconventional juxtaposition of a number \nof proportional counters, with the walls bet\xad\nween the wires eliminated to give parallel \nwires arranged in a plane located between \ntwo cathode planes (Fig. 1a). He realised \nthat for operation in an appropriate gas mix\xad\nture, each wire would behave as a propor\xad\ntional counter when the wire diameter was \nof the order of 1% of the wire spacing. This \nbehavior can be understood in terms of the \nalmost concentric field lines around the \nanode wires (Fig. 1b). A charged particle \npassing through the gas-filled chamber \nionizes the gas and, in the electric field, the \nelectrons move towards one of the anode \nwires (Fig. 1c). Charge multiplication occurs \nin the region around the wire where the field \nstrength increases as 1/r, r being the dis\xad\ntance to the wire axis. Most of the electron- \nion pairs are created in the vicinity of the \nwire so the time behaviour of the signal is \nprimarily determined by the motion of the \nions, which are travelling reasonably rapidly \nin the electric field. The energy resolution of \nthe detector is comparable to that of a con\xad\nventional cylindrical proportional chamber.\nCharpak worked with anode wire spac- \nings down to 1 mm (the spacing determines\nthe intrinsic space resolution if the drift time \nis not measured). However, he at an early \nstage reported experimental evidence show\xad\ning that the time delay of the pulse (drift time \nof electrons migrating towards the wires) \ncan be used to measure particle tracks \nmore accurately than the limitation imposed \nby the wire spacing.\nPioneering Work\nSpark chambers had been used for some \ntime to determine the trajectories of particles \nin the selective search for elementary par\xad\nticles in dedicated electronic detectors \n("counter physics” in contrast to “bubble \nchamber physics"). But they had consider\xad\nable drawbacks such as poor multi-hit effi\xad\nciency, large dead time, and the production \nof a huge amount of electromagnetic noise \nwhich disturbed nearby electronics. It was \nalso impossible to include information about \nthe trajectories in the detector’s high-speed \ntrigger circuit. The spark chamber technique \nhad reached its limits and this partly deter\xad\nmined progress in particle physics.\nCharpak published his pioneering work on \nmultiwire proportional chambers [1] at this \ncrucial juncture. It was some 40 years after \nthe famous work by the Austrian physicists \nG. Ortner and G. Stetter on the develop\xad\nment of Geiger-Müller and proportional \ntubes and their application for physical mea\xad\nsurements [2]. Charpak\'s first report indi\xad\ncates very clearly a new direction and all the \nmain advantages for particle detectors. It is \namazing to find here remarks concerning \npossibilities, sometimes realised many years \nlater, that led to various new types of detec\xad\ntors, notably:\n- different forms of drift chambers;\n- time-projection chambers (the "heart" of \nmodern storage-ring detectors);\nGeorges Charpak has been a Professor \nwith the Ecole supérieure de physique et chi\xad\nmie inustrielle de la Ville de Paris since 1948. \nBorn in 1924 in Poland, he emigrated in 1931 \nto France and studied in Paris, Montpellier \nand Lyon. After war service, he resumed his \nstudies at the Ecole des Mines, Paris, receiv\xad\ning his diploma in 1948. His doctorate in \nexperimental nuclear physics was awarded \nby the Collège de France in 1954 while work\xad\ning for the French CNRS. He joined the team \nmaking the first precision measurement of \nthe muon’s magnetic moment soon after \nmoving to CERN, Geneva, in 1959. Profes\xad\nsor Charpak retired from CERN in 1991 but \nremains active in the company Biospace that \nhe created in order to comercialise his detec\xad\ntors in biological fields. He is a member of the \nFrench Academy of Sciences and won the \nFrench Physical Society’s 1980 Prix Ricard \nas well as several other French and interna\xad\ntional awards.\n- detectors for particle identification (deposit \nof the energy £ with distance x, transition ra\xad\ndiation and Cherenkov detectors, and calori\xad\nmeters of various types);\n- X-ray detectors for biology, medicine and \nastrophysics.\nOwing largely to Charpak\'s work, particle \nphysicists have been able to focus their \ninterest on new physics: on the production \nand interaction of very rare particles which \noften reveal the secrets of the innermost \nconstituents of matter; on measuring diffe\xad\nrential cross-sections over many orders of \nmagnitude, with both low background and \nhigh precision; and on understanding the \ncorrections needed to take measurement \nerrors into account. Further advantages of \nmultiwire proportional chambers are:\n- event rates of 106 Hz and more can be \nhandled;\n- DC-powered: can be used in a trigger re\xad\nquiring processing times below 100 ns;\n- the degree of ionization produced locally \nby the particles does not affect the overall \nefficiency (even the multi-hit efficiency can \nexceed 99%);\n- a local dead time of short duration;\n- relatively unaffected by strong magnetic \nfields;\n- good signal-to-background ratio.\nCharpak has been at the forefront of the \ndevelopment of multiwire proportional cham\xad\nbers for more than two decades, and va\xad\nrious versions of his detectors were decisive \nfor many discoveries in particle physics. \nNobel Prizes have been awarded for some \nof these, notably for the discoveries of the\n184 Europhys.

Van der Meer).\nIt is pleasing that with G. Charpak a \ndetector expert has received the Nobel \nPrize, for people developing and working \nwith experimental techniques are often \nsomewhat shadowed by those who search \nfor (and find) new particles.\nEarly History\nIn order to understand the authors' enthu\xad\nsiasm one must go back to the late-1960's. \nThe construction at CERN of the Intersect\xad\ning Storage Rings (ISR) was well underway, \nand the highest collision energies in the \nworld were expected (63 GeV center-of- \nmass energy). However, nobody was able \nto deal with event rates of the order of seve\xad\nral tens of kHz, to design selective triggers \nwith sufficiently low accidental rates, and to \nmeasure particle tracks with the necessary \nprecision. All hopes were directed at Char- \npak’s invention, who was (together with A. \nMinten) responsible for the basic instrumen\xad\ntation of the largest spectrometer magnet \ncalled SFM, the Split Field Magnet (Fig. 2). \nAs our collaboration (CERN-Hamburg-Orsay- \nVienna) was supposed to perform the first \nlarge-scale experiment (Intersect 4-01) at \nthis facility, scientists had been assigned to \nCharpak's group [3]. One of us (W.B.) was \nresponsible for designing the special detec\xad\ntors specific for our experiment (Fig. 3) while \nanother (M.R.) was responsible for Monte \nCarlo simulations to study the optimal detec\xad\ntor layout, and for developing high-speed \nalgorithms able to handle the impressively \nlarge flow of information that was expected.\nIt should also not be forgotten that Char\xad\npak's invention was immediately taken up \nby the group of J. Steinberger, the Nobel \nlaureate, for a fixed-target, high-precision \nCP-violation experiment. This was in colla\xad\nboration with the University of Heidelberg, \nGermany [4], which also gave an essential \nimpetus to the initial development of drift \nchambers.\nMany problems had to be studied in depth \nduring this exciting period, including spu\xad\nrious currents, breakdowns, electrostatic in\xad\nstabilities, and the optimum gas mixture. \nSome of these studies were soon to be \nassisted by scientists from the USA and the \nformer USSR (who organized the first inter\xad\nnational wire chamber conference). Many \nyears later, Charpak’s opening talk at the \nVienna Wire Chamber Conference began \nwith the phrase “Les funérailles des cham\xad\nbres à fils (the burial of wire chambers)”. But \nwire chambers are still very much alive. This \nyear’s conference in Vienna demonstrated \nthat considerable progress in fundamental \nunderstanding is still being made (time de\xad\nvelopment of chamber pulses, precise cal\xad\nculation of the Townsend coefficient, ageing \nstudies, gas microstrip detectors, etc.).\nOther Developments\nNuclear and particle physics\nThe discovery of the wire chamber ope\xad\nned up an avalanche of new developments, \nboth at CERN and elsewhere. Drift cham\xad\nbers came into being by simply using a lar\xad\nger anode wire distance (a few centimetres) \ntogether with a potential wire to generate a \ndrift field in between the wires. In an impro\xad\nved version, field shaping wires replaced the \ncathode foil, thus creating a fairly homoge\xad\nneous drift field in the direction towards the \ncathode wire (Fig. 4). This technique im\xad\nproves the spatial resolution to about 100 \nµm but with the drawback of a reduced trig\xad\nger rate capability as one anode wire sam\xad\nples a large area.\nUsing new construction methods, the \noriginal idea of circular cathodes was taken \nup again to develop the straw tube comprising\npipes of thin, metallised plastic foils \nof a few millimetres in diameter for applica\xad\ntions in high-intensity environments near the \nintersection areas of high-energy particle \ncolliders. Tubes of different sizes are pre\xad\nferred, with extended gas amplification on \nthe anode wire (i.e., in a streamer mode). At \nleast ten times more charge compared to \nthe proportional mode is created in this \nmode since streamers develop from a thic\xad\nker anode wire (about 100 µm diameter) in \nthe strong electric field penetrating into the \ngas volume. The time development of the \ncollected charge is dominated by a more \nrapid motion of the electrons so the gain and \npower dissipation (and cost) of subsequent \namplifiers can be reduced.\nAn important field, namely high-energy \nparticle identification (energies up to several \n100 GeV/c) became feasible. Relativistic ef\xad\nfects introduced by charged particles having \ndifferent Lorentz factors are used to distin\xad\nguish between different particles. Two \napproaches are well-established:\n1) dE/dx method, where the number of elec- \ntron/ion pairs produced by a highly energetic \nparticle traversing a medium increases with \nincreasing energy (relativistic rise). If the \nvolume of gas transversed is large enough, \na sufficient number of ion pairs are pro\xad\nduced for distinguishing, in spite of statisti\xad\ncal fluctuations, between particles of the \nsame momenta, but different masses. Par\xad\nticle type and direction are simultaneously \nregistered by a large number of sampling \nwires. In practice, electrons drift several \nmetres towards a wire chamber where the\nFig. 4 — Schematic illustration \nof a drift chamber. The dis\xad\ntance between anode wires is \nfairly large (a few cms) and \nfield shaping wires replace the \ncathode foil to create a fairly \nhomogeneous drift field to\xad\nwards the cathode wire.\nEurophys. News 23 (1992) 185\n", "projection of the track is detected. Enor\xad\nmous gas volumes (up to 40 m3) are used to \ndeposit the ionization of the particle. A com\xad\nmon type of detector is the Time Projection \nChamber where the drift distance is com\xad\nputed from the drift time to determine the \ntrack position in space.\n2) Photon method, which uses the transition \nradiation of radiators interleaved between \nmultiwire proportional chambers sensitive to \nphotons of about 10 eV to provide powerful \nπ/e discrimination for particles with extreme\xad\nly high γ-factors.\nFinally, one should not forget the Ring \nImaging Čherenkov detector (RICH) for \nπ/K/p separation, where Čherenkov photons \nionize the gas of a drift chamber containing \na small quantity of a special gas (TMAE); \nand calorimetry, which has become a \npowerful tool for energy measurements in \nparticle physics using arrangements of \nmaterial for shower production alternating \nwith wire chambers.\nOther fields\nCharpak's work and influence did not stop \nwith the successful exploitation of wire \nchambers in nuclear and particle physics for \nhe also developed applications in biology,\nmedicine, synchrotron radiation, and astro\xad\nphysics. For X-ray measurements in nuclear \nmedicine, he worked on a high-pressure, \nxenon filled, gas scintillation counters and \ncontinued with photoionization proportional \nscintillation detectors, where the energy res\xad\nolution went down to less than 10% FWHM \nat 5.9 KeV. Indeed, the required radiation \ndose to a patient is reduced by an order of \nmagnitude using a wire-chamber imaging \ncamera. The multistep avalanche chamber \nhas been used for radiochromatography \n(tritium loaded) and, in conjunction with opti\xad\ncal CCD readout, renal ducts of about 50 \npm are visible with 100 times less exposure \ntime as compared to photographic methods. \nAnother device is the spherical drift cham\xad\nber for X-ray imaging applications: the drift \nspace is spherical and the electric drift field \nis radial, giving an ideal detector for a point\xad\nlike source. It is employed successfully for \nprotein diffraction pattern measurements.\nVarious systems for medical imaging are \nused in hospitals. One Is a positron emis\xad\nsion tomography camera for routine tomo\xad\ngraphic imaging consisting of two or more \nwire chambers (Rutherford-Appleton Labo\xad\nratory, UK; Cantonal Hospital, Geneva.) An\xad\nother is a computer-assisted digital X-ray\ndiagnostic camera which has improved re\xad\nsolution and requires only one-tenth of the \ndose compared with conventional methods \n(in clinical use in Moscow and Novosibirsk).\nIn addition to scientific accomplishments, \nGeorge Charpak is distinguished by his \nhumanitarianism. Aside from his involve\xad\nment in medical applications of wire cham\xad\nbers, he has been a strong defender of \nhuman rights, the most spectacular action \nbeing in defense of Yuri Orlov, an interna\xad\ntionally renowned Russian accelerator phy\xad\nsicist who founded the Moscow-Helsinki \nWatch Group in 1976. Orlov was set free \nin 1986 following international pressure. \nCharpak was also a beloved teacher, and \nmany of his former disciples were glad to \nbecome his friends, including the authors.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Charpak G., et al., Nuclear Inst. & Me\xad\nthods 62 (1968) 262.\n[2] Ortner G. and Stetter G., Mitteilungen des \nInstituts für Radiumforschung, No. 228 \n(1928).\n[3] Charpak G., et al., Nuclear Inst. & Me\xad\nthods 97 (1971) 377.\n[4] Schilly P., et al., ibid. 91 (1971) 221.\nEurophysics\nNotes\n•  Donated Proceedings to be Available\nThe International Centre for Theoretical \nPhysics in Trieste distributed during the last \n12 months some 37 000 donated volumes of \njournals, books and proceedings to over \n1500 institutes in developing countries via its \nDonation Programme. However, owing to the \nexplosion in scientific publishing and to an \nincreased interest in the programme, dona\xad\ntions in the last four years have run at rough\xad\nly twice the average distribution rate of \n40 000 - 50 000 volumes p.a. Some 170 000 \nvolumes are now in commercial storage, \nmostly unpacked.

Some 1100 kECU comprised a \ngrant to the European Science Foundation \nfor European Research Conferences (phys\xad\nics ERC’s are organized by the ESF based \non proposals from EPS Divisions that are \ncoordinated by the EPS Working Group on \nERC’s). The grant has been assigned chron\xad\nologically which means that the four physics \nseries of two meetings slated for late-1992 \nand early-1993 have 205 kECU available. \nThe roughly 20-25 kECU per meeting would \nseem to be the level of EC support one can \nexpect for ERC’s.\nAlthough the CODEST physics panel \napproved on a case-by-case basis the full \nprogramme of 1993 ERC’s in physics pro\xad\nposed to it by the ESF, the panel also appro\xad\nved other events. The final result was to re\xad\ncommend 25.5% of the 1020 kECU for ESF \nevents. Chemistry, on the other hand, recom\xad\nmended 58% of its total, and both life scien\xad\nces and earth sciences 74%. The ESF is \nconcerned that the low percentage for phys\xad\nics appears to reflect poor support for its \nERC’s. Indeed, “renormalising” by multiplying \nthe allocations for the various disciplines by \nthe percentages recommended by the corre\xad\nsponding CODEST panels for ESF events \ngives a total of 1243 kECU of which only 697 \nx 0.255 = 178 kECU is for physics. The argu\xad\nment is that ERC’s could perhaps be expec\xad\nted to be assigned the normalised amounts \nfrom the ESF grant, whereupon chemistry \nwould receive 122%, life sciences 110% and \nphysics 68 % of the amounts recommended \nby their panels for ESF events. This as\xad\nsumes, however, that the HCM programme’s \nmanagement committee assigns equal \nweights for ESF and non-ESF events in mak\xad\ning its final allocation: a priori, this is not ne\xad\ncessarily the case.\nKlaus Bethge who chairs the EPS Working \nGroup on ERC’s stresses that EPS, and by\nimplication the physics community, is fully \nbehind the ERC’s. He sees no reason for \nthinking that the ERC programme is jeopar\xad\ndised if a CODEST panel recommends a rel\xad\natively large number of non-ESF events. The \nEC has provided valuable support to the \nERC’s since the start and is clearly continu\xad\ning to do so.\nIt is estimated that a further 307 kECU will \nbe needed in order to cover the rest of the \nplanned programme of nine two-meeting \nseries of physics ERC’s for 1993. There will \nbe two HCM selection rounds in 1993 involv\xad\ning 7 MECU in total (roughly the same \namount per round as for the 1992 round) so it \nis perhaps reasonable to assume that the \nadditional sum will be found. But it is essen\xad\ntial that this is so as the ESF is announcing \nERC’s in physics in this Meetings Issue \nwhich are not yet covered by EC funds.\nAnother concern involves the interpretation \nof HCM rules regarding what can be paid for. \nThe Commission of the EC now accepts that \nthe ESF’s EC grant can in principle cover \nsizable participation fees for young scientists, \nand not just their travel and accommodation. \nAlthough this interpretation will have to be \ntested as accounts are returned to the CEC \nby the ESF, it will essentially allow expenses \nfor invited speakers to be met by the EC \ngrant — a vital feature for organizers plan\xad\nning meaningful events which attract young \nscientists.\n•  Journals to the FSU\nK.K. Phua, Chairman of World Scientific \nPublishing, writes to say that the WSP is cur\xad\nrently sending complimentary copies of Int. J. \nof Modem Phys. A and Modern Phys. Lett. A \nto 27 institutes in the former Soviet Union. \nTwelve Institutes also receive Int. J. of Mo\xad\ndern Phys. B and Modern Phys. Lett. B. He \nstress the importance of providing current \nissues since it is esential to help transfer the \nlatest information.\n186 Europhys. News 23 (1992)\n"]</pre>
