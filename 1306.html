President Johnson and, General Grant were in the review, ing stand as the veterans swung, proudly past to the exulting music, of tueir bands, while the battle, fla^s that had flown on a hundred, bloody fields, waved over the tri, umphant host., T.iis thrilling pageant, of na, tional interest, will be reproduced, as far as possible during the forty, ninth annual encampment of the |, Graud Army of the Republic, which, will be held in Washington, Sep, tember 27 to October 3, next, ae, coidiag to the auuouncement made, he:e today., It will be the fiftieth anniversary, o;\' tlie Grand Review. Thousands of, the same veterans who inarched in, that review a half century ago nni- 1, formed in the Union blue, will, again keep step to martial music, down Pennsylvania avenue, aud, pass in \\iarade before President Wil, son and members of his cabinet. It, will be the last time the veterans, will march in Washington, and the, last time that hundreds of them, w\'U evL-r again atteud an encamp, rc. ;nl, as the aged men are fast, passing away., 7 ho Grand Army, which survived, Jn>n yonrs of campaigns and never, surrendered, will soon have to, towei its standards, defeated by, Time, the only enemy able to, vanoMish the veterans. Because of, the increasing death rate and the, feebleness of the survivors of the, grrt>t war, it is probable that the, Gran,! Army will never again hold, a great encampment after the Wash, ton event. As this gathering is the, last i.i which many of them will par, tiiiuate, and as the anniversary of, the Grind Review is of such his, toric significance to them and the, -.ou.itry, they will make great ef, forts to be iu Washinton in, September.

Ben bought, it and conceived the Idea of making a, park of it. lie secured options on all, the bordering property, then gave his, original purchase to the town on con, dition they would make a park of. It, "Sam Rogers when about twenty-flve, years old left the town, regretted by, every impecunious person in it The, more successful citizens said, "A good, riddance." At the end of a dozeu, years Sam came back and surprised, every one by bringing a fortune with, him. When asked how he got it he, said it was by pure luck. This was, all they could get out of him, but I, learned the truth long after his death,, lie had loaned a man a hundred dol, lars to save a piece of property he, owned, the property afterward be, came very valuable, and when the, owner died, having no one else to, leave It to, he left It to Sam Rogers., "Sam on his return resumed his giv, ing to needy persons, only he now gave, ?10 where formerly he had given 10, cents. Ills brother, Ben, had been sav, ing his money and had got enough to, gether to begin to think about making, an investment on a larger scale. It was, soon after Sam\'s return that the orig, inal owner of this property died. Ben, not having enough money to carry out, his enterprise called on his brother, to go In with him. Sam said that he, didn\'t want to make any more money, than he had already, but ho would, loan Ben all he wanted., "I was then studying law with Ben, Rogers\' attorney and know whereof, I\'m going to tell you.

A number of persons, whom he had befriended bought a lot, In the cemetery and buried him there., "Ben Rogers became the most influ, ential man in the town, and when any, important town matter was to be de, cided he was called upon for his opin, ion. lie built a church on a worthless, tract of laud lie owned and sold off the, rest of the tract for another fortune,, lie established other institutions, con, triving to make money out of all of, them., "When he died he left money for a, suitable monument, desiring that he, should be burled in the park that boro, his name and which it had given him, so much pleasure to have provided for, the enjoyment of the people of his na, tive town. Ills executors had been In, structed by him before his death to, provide that statue, for -which and Its, pedestal $50,000 had been provided In, the will.", When the narrator had finished his, story I expressed a desire to visit the, grave of Samuel Rogers. He told mo, that the cemetery was not half a mile, away, and I determined to take a, stroll In that direction. He also told, me where to find the grave in among, the less desirable lots. I thanked him, for his story and passed on., When I reached the cemetery I ask, ed a well to do looking person I Baw, there if ho could direct me to the, grave of Samuel Rogers.

It was, however,, in a considered Judgment in the court, of exchequer that Baron Bramwell, made his famous contribution to tho, discussion., "A man\'s rights," said the baron,, "are to be determined by the court, not, by his advocate or counsel. It is for, want of remembering this that foolish, [ people object to lawyers that they will, advocate a case against their own, [ opinions. A client is entitled to say to, his counsel: \'I want your advocacy, not, your Judgment I prefer that of the, Court\'" Mr. Justlco Darling, in tho, Jargon of ttw courts, concurs., Laymen have usually been readier, than lawyers to discuss the ethics of, advocacy. "What do you think of sup, porting a cause you know to be bad?", Everybody knows Dr. Johnson\'s reply, when Boswell asked him this question., "Sir, you do not know it to be good or, bad till the Judge determines it", Less generally known 13 Sydney, | Bmlth\'s contribution to the discussion., "Justice is found experimentally to be, most effectually promoted by the oppo, site efforts of practiced and ingenious, men presenting to the selection of an, impartial Judge the best arguments, for the establishment or explanation, of truth. It becomes, then, under such, an arrangement the decided duty of, an advocate to use all the arguments, in his power to defend the cause he, has adopted and to leave tho effects of, those arguments to the Judgment of, others."

A. MITCHEL, [This story Is more than a story. It, Is n historical account of a duel that, occurred 400 years ago and a fine Il, lustration of the difference between, tho method of settling affairs of hon, or among men In tho olden time and, tho beginning of the nineteenth cen, tury, when mortal combat to settle dif, ficulties between Individuals may be, said to havo received Its quietus in the, new world in the death of Alexander, Hamilton at the hands of Aaron Burr.], "How comes It, Guteliot, that you, are able to mako so brave a show with, the revenues which you have, for I, know that they are not excessive?", Tho question -was asked of Guy Cha, bot Sleur do Jarnac by tho dauphin,, who aftorward became Henry II., king, of France., Jarnac, embarrassed at such a ques, tion, was unfortunate in the choice of, words used in his reply. He said that, his stepmother kept him, giving hlin, everything he required. Henry delib, erately misconstrued the statement, and reporti\'<l to members of the court, that Jarnac had boasted of a love af, fair with his stepmother., Horrified, Indignant at such an ac, cusation. the young man publicly de, clared that whoever had made the as, sertion was "a malicious villain and, bad wickedly lied." Then, hastening, to his father\'s chateau, he threw him, self at Ills feet and protested that he, was Innocent of tho charge. Having, convinced his father, he returned to, court intent upon avenging the injury, done him., The dauphlu found himself in a very, unpleasant position. When princes err, there must be a scapegoat. Francis, Vlvowne, Sleur de Chatagnerie, a cour, tier in favor both with King Francis, and the dauphin, n young warrior of, great prowess, though a friend of Jar, nac, seeing that ho would confer a, great favor on tho future king by do, ing so, took up the quarrel in his be, half, doclaring that It was to him and, him alone that Jarnac had made his, boast., Duels at this time were a part of the, feudal tradition and law of France,, requiring tho consent of the king., Francis referred the matter to the, privy council, which after a long debato, recommended that permission to light, be refused. Rut no sooner had the, king died and the dauphin ascended, the throne than Chatagnerie addressed, a letter to the new king, repeating his, accusation, whereupon Jarnac made, a request that the duel be permitted to, take place. Tho king consented, and, arrangements for the contest were, forthwith made., Chatagnerio was twenty-six years, old. while lils adversary was thirty-six., Tlio former was also of great strength, and very ready with his sword. IIo, was continually boasting of his feats, of arms and ever ready to pick a quar, rel. In short, he was just the man to, vindicate his royal master in his con, temptible charge., At that time the same rule of the, code, that the challenged party should, have the choice of arms, existed as it, has since. Jarnac had accused his ad, versary of a lie and had been challeng, ed: therefore ho was permitted to Bght, in any way he pleased. Upon the ad, vice of his fencing master he demand, ed the heavy armor and long double, edged swords in vogue a century be, fore. The reason for this was that his, opponent had been wounded in battlo, in the right arm and had never re, gained perfect use of it, and the, heavy iron gauntlet and sword would, naturally hamper tho movements of, this arm. Chatagnerie\'s great strength, gave him an advantage in closing with, his enemy, downing him and stabbing, him while prostrate. The armor in this, case would be to his disadvantage., Jarnac also stipulated for heavy, shields, which would be an advantage, to the weaker party, who would nat, j urally be on the defensive., Chatagnerie seemed to have no fear, | whatever of making an easy conquest, \' of his adversary. As ho was aceus, j tomed to boast of the deeds he had, I performed, he now boasted of the deed, j he was about to perform. He ordered, j a banquet to be served in his tent on, 1 the field, to which ho invited the court, to celebrate his victory., Naturally the affair was the sensa, tion of the day. The courtiers were, largely on the side of the king\'s scape, goat, and Henry did not deny that his, own sympathies were with Chata, gnerie. The provincial nobility, of, whom the Jarnac family were mem, bers, regarded Jarnac as the defender, of their honor and looked upon him as, their champion. One of the powerful, Guise family was to act as second for, the royal scapegoat, and the Duke de, Vendome of a rival family to the, Guises asked the king\'s permission to, act for Jarnac. He was refused and, dis, gusted at the king\'s favoritism, with, drew, followed by the other princes, of the blood. The constable of France, then filled the position., The king having announced his In, tention to preside at the encounter, the, constable made arrangements in ac, cordance with the dignity of the occa, sion. The field having been selected, a, space for tho combat was marked on*, and suitable accommodations provided, for the king, court and nobility, the, king and his tribune in the center, the, tribune being tho constable and mar, ! shnls of France, who were the judges., The day of the duel was a beautiful, morning in midsummer. Crowds from, Paris began early to pour forth to, ward the battlegrouud. The nrchers, of the guard took the place of mod, ern policemen in keeping the crowd, from breaking through the barrier and, Invading the field of battle. The king, arrived, attended by his sister, princes, of tho blood and many nobles. A sin, gular feature was an executioner and, his assistants, who were Intended to, j take charge of the corpse of the van, quished, in case he was killed, for, hanging on a gibbet, As soon as the king was seated the, herald advanced and proclaimed the, combat, asserting that no one should, interfere with either of the combat, ants on peril of his life. Chatagnerle, left his tent, accompanied by some 500, of his friends. Jarnac next appeared,, escorted by the grand equerry and 120, gentlemen wearing his colors. The, shields of tlio combatants were hung, on either side of the king. Then came, the ceremony of the presentation of, tho arms, which was principally a test, ing of tho weapons. This having been, accomplished, there was another long, proclamation from the herald, and the, combatants having paraded around the, field, preceded by their arras, after a, religious ceremony in which each af, firmed his cause to be a just one, they, were conducted to their stations, and, tho herald, advancing, shouted, "Lais, sez aller les bons combatants," which, means In plain American, "Let \'em, go!", Such la a condensation of the prelim, inaries to a duel In high life during the, middle of the sixteenth century. The, fight was by no means commensurate, with the preparation, for It was de, cided quickly. The duelists advanced,, Jarnac slowly, protecting himself with, his shield; Chatagnerle rapidly and, full of confidence. As soon as they, met the latter sprang upon his oppo, nent, aiming a crushing blow at his, head. Jarnac, Instead of warding off, the blow with his sword, as was to be, expected, received it on his shield and,, ducking, made a thrust for his oppo, nent\'s legs. lie struck Chatagnerle in, the hollow of the knee. Before the lat, ter could recover himself Jarnac re, peated the thrust at the same point, and cut the tendons, giving a new, phrase to dueling—tho coup de Jarnac,, which in those days was not a foul,, but perfectly legitimate. Chatagnerle, staggered, dropped his sword and fell,, the blood flowing from his wound., A cry of nmazement greeted this con, quest of the champion swordsman of, France within a few seconds by one, who had no espccial reputation as a, man at arms., jsy me coon or rone uu.v >nn*« touues, were open to the victor—lie might kill, lils opponent ami hand his body over, to the executioner to be hunged; he, might spare bis life after exacting a, restoration of bis honor by the van, quished confessing hlmsolf to be in er, ror, or he might surrender him to the, king. Jnrnac called upon his enemy to, restore him his honor. Chatagnerle\'s, reply was an attempt to rise, but it, failed. Jarnac, then advancing to the, king, said:, "Sire, I entreat you to esteem mc a, man of honor. I give you Chata, gnerie\'s life. It is our youth alone, which is the cause of this trouble. Let, no Imputation rest either on his family, or upon him on account of his offense,, for I surrender him to you.", Put the king, not realizing that bis, scapegoat was unable to continue the, fight, made no answer. Jarnac raised, his eyes to heaven. "Lord, I am not, worthy, for It Is not to myself, but to, thee, that I owe the victory." Then,, returning to Chatagnerie, he bogged, him to surrender. But the scapegoat,, raising himself on one knee and re, gaining his lost sword, endeavored to, strike. Jarnac stepped back, saying,, "Po not move or I will kill you.", "Kill me," replied (be vanquished man, and fell back exhausted- from loss of, blood., Again Jarnac went to the king and, Implored him to give him the victory,, a victory which condemned the king, himself, but Henry refused. Jarnac,, expecting that his former friend would, bleed to death, cried: "Sire, be Is dy, ing. For the love of heaven, accept his, life at my hands!" Henry, refusing to, pronounce his own condemnation, still, refused till the constable joined his en, treaties to those of Jarnac. Then, Henry, seeing that the sympathies of, the assembly were against him, said, to Jarnac, "You have done your duty,, and your honor should be restored to, you." And he ordered that Chatn, gnerle be removed. Jarnac had the, right to be escorted from the field by, his followers to the sound of martial, music, but he declined the honor., When he refused the king, having had, time to curb his disappointment, call, ed him to the tribune and, as the vic, tor was about to kneel to him, em, braced him, saying that he had fought, like Caesar and spoken like Aristotle., Never was there such multiplicity of, preparation for so brief a contest, nev, er a more flagrant case of a man guilty, of a contemptible act accepting the de, fense of another and being judge of, the issue, withholding the verdict un, til forced by opinion to pronounce it, At the conclusion of the tournament, the brilliant assembly broke up, and,, tho king leading the way, all returned, to Paris., Jarnac\'s victory fell no less heavily, on the king than on his defender., Chutagnerie felt his fall so keenly that, he refused to live after It The sur, geons bound his knee with bandages,, but he tore them off. Again they put, them on, and again the miserable man, tore them off, repeating the act till at, loot m~j« *—»«, RECOVERED, Los Angeles, July 7—A \' party, of wreckers has been working, \'juiitly ia Alaska waters to recover, t)\'e sold on the steamer Islander,, which went down in 1002 with a, heavy loss of life. The spot at, which the boat went down has been, a matter of guess work and all ef, forts to locate the wreck to recover, the gold failed until the boat was, discovered last year by a fisherman, and he interested the local divers, who finally sent a small ship north, and worked the past year to re, cover the gold dust in the safe of, the shi£>., The Islander struck a largo ice, burg o£f Taku glacier some distanco, south ■\' Juneau.
