L Quicksall. state\nagnt for Central and West Texas of\nthe demonstration farm work of tbe\nBureau\' of plant industry of the fed\neral government.\nOf tbls speech. Prof. II. L. Mc-\nKnlgbt,- altant professor of agri\nculture of the A. and M. College of\nTexaa, who was present, says: "In a\nlecture to tbe Brazos county farmers\nAugust 13 Mr. Quicksall referred to a\ncertain demonstration farm In Burles\non county where the land bad been\nbroken ten Inches deep, and as a re\nsult of this breaking that land Is tbls\nesson making thirty-five bushels of\ncorn per acre, whllo tbe same quality\nof land broken at an ordinary depth\nwaa making only ten bushel per acre.\nI have aked Mr. Quicksall to tell me\nthe location of the farm, and he de\nclines any further Information. The\nreader I left to draw his own couclu\nslont. I always thought that a dem\nonstration farm waa conducted for;\nahow purposes that Is these farms \'\nare planned and operated purely as \'\nobject lessons, and 1 cannot under\nstand why he will refuse to locate the\nfarm when asked to do ao purely In\'\nthe Interest of better agricultural\nteaching."\nTne following is air. aicitnignt let\nter to Mr. QulcksalL\nProf. J. L, Quicksall. Waco, Texas.\nDear Sir: I recall that In your addres\nto the Brazos cranty farmers you\nmentioned an instance where remark\nable results have been obtained this\nseason by ten Inch breaking. If I\nremember correctly yon located this\nfarm in Burleson county. Just across\ntho line from tbls county. I write to\nask If you can give me the exact lo\ncation of this farm and the name of\nthe proprietor. I am willing to go\nsome little distance to see such a\nresult as you describe. You under\natand of course that there Is much de\nbate among agricultural writers and\nteachers relative to the value of ex\ntra deep breaking and you probably\nknow also, that I once advised this\ndeep plowinc I am free to say to\nyou now that I am getting mighty\nweak lu the faith. I advised this\nmethod on the strength of what other\npeople claimed for it. and not from\nmy own personal experiences. Vy\nbtiblness here Is to teach correct prin\nciples of agriculture and I am going\nto know the whole truth about this\nmooted question If it can be known.\nTo this end I would be glad to visit\ntbe farm referred to by you, that I\nmay see for myself the\' conditions un\nder which these reaiorkable results\nwere secured. You understand Mr.\nQuicksall. that In asking for the loca\ntion of tht particular farm 1 am not\nquestioning anybody\'s statement\nYour co-laborer,\nII. L. McKXIGHT.\nAslstant professor of Agriculture A.\nand M. College of Texas.\nThe following Is Mr. Qulcksall\'s re\nply: Waco. Texas, August 17. 1909.

U\nto you. In regard to our general tench\nIngs as to a thorough and deep prep\naration of the seed bed, there con be\nno question as to the correctness of\ntbe contention. It Is not only support\ned by the best authorities from a larg\nmajority of tbe exprlment station,\nbut la aim supported by the practleo\nof the best farmers In Texas, and the\nmore I see of this work, the more con\nfirmed In the faith. I am glad to\nnote that you are seeking to know the\nwhole truth of this matter and I ball\no glad to give yon a complete detailed\nstatement of several of our demon\nstrators later In the fall. We too\nwant to bo very .careful aa to our\nrecconietidatlona. along these lines,\nbecause a you know aomo people are\nalways ready to criticize any agrl-\nWe offer to cur cu. c\nadvantage concictcnt vl:!i c\nmethods and tho meet ccu;Luj\nmerit is extended to thc:2 vI;d c\nBanking facilities.\nYour Account is\nBasis of Absolute\nSquare Deal.\nTb City Nafcid\nt. $, r:rj. rm::::t\na. a c":r\nI Landrcdih\nOil s.\nPHONE 142\nfroooooooooooooooooooccccc : :\ncultural Improvement or development\nno matter bow rneritorloua It may be\nVery truly your.\nJ. L. QICKSALL.\nBute Agent for Central and West\nTexas, United States Department of\nArrlcnlture, Bureau of Plant Indus\ntry. W. C. Wellborn says: "The Texas\nExperiment Station has not been able\nto secure any such remarkable re\nI suit from deep plowing. Indeed tbls\nstation has not been able to secure\nresults that will even begin to Justify\nthe extra expense Involved in ten inch\nbreaking, and we specifically deny\nthat other, experiment station have\ngotten suck results ai Mr. Quicksall\nclaims they have. It seems that Mr.\nQuicksall cannot do less than name\nand locate tbls particular farm if\n( there la such a farm that farmera\nand others may have an opportunity\nto see for themselves."\nI HEAD ALMOST CUT OFF.\nIn a negro fight at Royder\'s store\nIn tbe Brazos bottom Saturday night\nStokes Harly waa dangerously rut\nby Charley Ophelia.

I thought of it\nyesterday when I met In the bath\nhouse a prominent physician of my\nacquaintance. I had disrobed In a\ndressing room and. arrayed in a white\nsheet like a ghost, was on the way to\ntbe hot water tub, when 1 heard my\nname called. Tbe doctor waa stretch\ned full length on a marble slab under\ngoing the salt massage. He la over\nsix feet In stature and weighs rather\nmore than two hundred pounds. After\ngrasping hla hand ! paused for a\nmoment to admire bis powerful, his\nsy metrical physique, every line of\nwhich Indicated health and strength,\nlie, was about the last man I should\nhave supposed to be In need of rem\nedial treatment for any of the Ills\nthat flesh la heir to, and my Impres\nsion at the time was that he waa tak\ning a bath to gratify a whim or to\nadd this experience to his stock of\npractical knowledge. But later In the\ncooling room, while we were resting\non contiguous wicker cota, bo told me\nthat he is a victim of rheumatism\nand has come to take "the full course."\nThe doctor\'s case Is one of many\nIllustrations of the truth that appear\nancess are deceitful.
