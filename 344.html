        <pre>['JOllrnal of Adolescence 1978, I, 297-307\nAdolescent depression: an Illness or\ndevelopmental task?*\nRONALD DAKERt\nIn this paper, I have discussed depression in adolescence from its occurrence\nas a manifestation of health, in relation to developmental tasks,\nand from the standpoint of it being indicative of illness and pathology.\nI have taken the capacity to experiencethe loss of the object with the\npresence of appropriate levels of .depressive affect as being commensurate\nwith mental health and the achievement of adequate mastery of\nthe developmental tasks, and have used the notion of mourning to\nillustrate my theoretical view. As an example of the pathological m anifestation\nof depression I have taken the suicidal adolescent and examined\nhis symptoms and behaviour in the context of his incapacity to negotiate\nthe developmental r tasks and the factors which militate against the\nmourning process. I have not included clinical examples, but the main\nthrust of my statement is a direct reflection of the clinical position to\nwhich I subscribe. In particular, I have emphasised the importance of\nthe-inner world of the adolescent and the importance to the professional\nworker ofunderstanding the destructive nature of the counter-transference,\nas evoked by these depressed adolescents.\nIn this presentation, I propose to look at depression as it appears during the\ncourse of adolescent development. I shall consider it variously from the points\nof view of cause, effect, health and illness, but always in the context of the\nstriking features characteristic of adolescence, namely, the maturing of the\ngenitals and the enormous increase in the intensity of the sexual and aggressive\nimpulses, fuelled by the revival of infantile urges and fantasies.\nDespite the ongoing debate as to what constitutes normality and pathology\nin relation to certain emotions, it is apparent that there is still a demand for\nclarification of such concepts as "normal sadness" on the one hand and\ndepression equated with breakdown or mental illness on the other. It seems\nto me to be important that the professional worker engaged in the assessment\n• Presented at a day of talks and discussions on "A Psychoanalytical View of Depression\nin Adolescence" at the British Psychoanalytical Society, 10 June 1978.\nt Consultant Psychoanalyst, London Clinic of Psychoanalysis, Brent Consultation Centre\nand Centre for Research into Adolescent Breakdown; 33 Priory Gardens, Highgate , London\nN6sQU.\n© 1978 The Association (or the Psychiatric Study o( Adolescents\n297\n', '298 R. DAKER\nand treatment of the upset adolescent has access to a model which will help\nhim to discern the difference between illness and developmental task. The\noffshoot of this means curtailment of the widely fashionable opinion that\ndepression in adolescence is a "passing phase", a view which has fostered\ncomplacency at all levels, and which to my mind has contributed to the\npaucity of services available to the adolescent at risk.\nLet me first examine depression as a so-called "normal" responsedepression\nwhich is a reaction to frustration, disappointment or loss. This is a\nubiquitous experience and is seen, for instance, in relation to examination\nfailure, loss of a boy or girl friend, feelings of rejection by the peer group and\nin response to the whole range of temporary situations where adolescents feel\nunloved or devalued, be it by friends, parents or conscience.\nSuch manifestations are, paradoxically, relatively more acceptable to some\nworkers than the more severe forms of depression. They can be readily seen as\nhaving an adaptive function in relation to a changed situation. Yet, not\ninfrequently an adolescent is told by his G.P., or social worker to "cheer up"\nor "snap out of it". No sophisticated worker would deny the importance of the\nmourning process, and yet, there seems to be an expectation or demand to\nemerge from it, relatively unscathed. But is this necessarily valid for the\nadolescent? This is a question I shall return to presently. At this juncture, I\nshould like to stress, that by implication, there are certain situations, indeed\nstresses, where it would reasonably be expected that depression would be an\nappropriate and healthy response, within certain limits of time and depth.\nExcessive reactions, however, do invoke defensive maladaptations and pathological\noutcomes. Similarly, the absence of depression, where it might be\nconsidered appropriate, should be seen as a danger sign and indicative of\nunderlying pathology. Unfortunately, it is frequently disregarded clinically\nor even explained away as a mature response. Where there is no depression in\nresponse to relinquishment or loss during adolescence the implication is that\nprimitive defences such as denial or splitting are operative, mechanisms which\nshould concern the clinician. In fact, if we view depression as existing on a\ncontinuum, in adolescence the norm would be the presence of depression\nrather than its absence.\nI now turn to degrees of depression that we would all agree, go beyond\nwhat could be considered appropriate, depressive states which are characterized\nby their persistence, and the failure of the adolescent to come through it.\nThese are highlighted by a deep sense of guilt, feelings of emptiness, worthlessness\nand self-hatred. Other symptoms, such as loneliness, lack of con-\nfidence, poor self-esteem and morbid preoccupations with death and dying\nmay complete the picture. The interviewer will be struck particularly by the\nadolescent\'s sense of incompetence, badness and acceptance of a denigrated\nself-image. Frequently there is a preoccupation that he or she is abnormal.\n', 'ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION: ILLNESS OR DEVELOPMENTAL TASK? 299\nSuch extreme manifestations remind one of the picture of depressive illness as\nit appears in a psychiatric text book rather than depression or sadness as an\nemotion. But whereas in adult cases, the roots of the depressive illness may\noften be obscure or hidden beyond reach, in the adolescent the roots and causes\nof depression are amenable to understanding and within the reach of the\nempathic professional, provided he is not infected by the pessimism of the\nadolescent, and thus driven to offering treatments such as anti-depressants or\nE.C.T. These, in my view, inevitably have the effect of increasing the adolescent\'s\nsense of hopelessness in the wake of his feeling that he is not under-\nstood .\nThe notions that adolescents either do not want to be understood or that\nthe cure for adolescence will be found in the passage of time and in the\nmaturational process are positions which are only tenable to those workers\nwho relegate or reject the central significance of the inner fantasy world of the\nadolescent. My own clinical experience leads me to believe that the adolescent\nlongs for understanding. This applies especially to the upset and depressed\nadolescent who despairs of those who engender hopelessness in him through\nbehaving as though time would solve his problems, or through the prescription\nof anti-depressants or tranquillisers. It has also been said that adolescents\ncharacteristically refuse false solutions. Again, nothing could be further from\nthe truth i indeed quite the contrary, the adolescent\'s vulnerability lies in his\nvery tendency, not only to accept false solutions or maladaptations, but to seek\nthem out un consciously.\nThe point which I am now putting forward is this: Emergence from adolescence\nmore or less emotionally intact is dependent at one level on his or her\ncapacity to be able to experience significant degrees of depression, these being\nof such intensity that the adolescent may be driven ultimately to reject a\nmaladaptation. If the adolescent seeks help the wish to be understood is\ncrucial. There is no more certain ",:ayto lose an adolescent patient than through\nnot understanding him, and this means understanding manifest as well as\ndefended against and distorted expressions of depression. But understanding\nis not all that is necessary; many skills merge in the therapist who succeeds in\nhelping the adolescent through psychotherapy, being able to understand the\nnature of the unconscious as well as the competence and capacity to understand\nthe pressure of his pain, hopelessness and pessimism, being the central\ndemands which confront the therapist.\nThe-foregoing comments beg the question, why should it be that even the\nhealthy adolescent is vulnerable to psychic pain, severe enought to be termed\nclinical depression? Furthermore, how can we substantiate the statement that\nthe absence of depression, of itself, indicates that something may beamiss?\nI shall endeavour to clarify the matter by reference to the tasks of adolescence,\nsuccessful negotiation of which are of paramount importance if the course\n', '30 0 R. BAKER\nfrom puberty to young adulthood is to be traversed without serious arrest in\ndevelopment, frank pathology or breakdown. The tasks involve change in:\n(I) the relationship with parents-moving from the position of dependency\nto becoming ·emotionally more independent. Ownership of\nthoughts and feelings should become independent of the parent\'s\ndemands and under normal circumstances the adolescent should be\nable to risk parental disapproval without necessarilysubmitting to them.\n(2) the relationship with contemporaries-to moving into friendships and\nrelationships with peer groups whose demands and expectations\ntranscend those of childhood and enhance the drive towards adulthood,\nand\n(3) attitude to the body-namely, seeing himself as masculine or herself\nas feminine, moving towards ownership of the body and taking\nresponsibility for its sexual demands and needs.\nThus, there would appear to be every reason, given the nature of these\ntasks, why even the most robustly healthy adolescent would encounter doubts,\nfeel unhappy, sense impending failure from time to time and wonder about the\nintactness of his future. This is the time when the drama of love relationships\nand friendships have their maximum impact, when the parents\' ideals and\nstandards arc most critically questioned, and when sexual development,\nwhich is being rapidly promoted at all levels, is making severe demands on the\nconscience, with conflicts over masturbation and guilt over unwelcome fantasies.\nSwings of mood and unpredictable behavior arc common. Most adoles-\ncents deal satisfactorily with the internal pressures of this period and achieve a\npositive outcome. There are however, many others who experience this time\nof their lives as a confirmation that there is something wrong with them. If\nthey give in to this feeling, the generation of self-hatred will be increased.\nAlternatively, they may deny the feeling of being stuck and fight it, possibly\nthreatening or battling with authority, or using a variety of equally ineffective\nefforts to cover the core of depression which oppresses them .\nTake the adolescent who sees himself as having moved away from the\nparents, even temporarily. He will experience this as a loss and in response is\nlikely to feel depression. This state is somewhat similar to mourning. Then\nthere is the adolescent who differs with and fights his parents. Such a battle\nis a perfectly normal part of adolescence until finally it may reach the point\nwhere the youngster feels that he is on "equal terms" with his parents, a\nrelatively good outcome. But if the adolescent felt unable to fight or differ with\nhis parents for fear of destroying them , the situation would be one where the\npotential to negotiate that task would be seriously undermined. The presence\nof this kind of fear in adolescents may show itself in depression-since such\nadolescents experience their differences with their parents as attacks on them.\nThese adolescents who cannot show a normal degree of anger are certainly at\n', 'ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION: ILLNESS OR DEVELOPMENTAL TASK? 301\nrisk and the \'stalemate\' that exists within them, when combined with feelings\nof hopelessness and worthlessness may pave the way for the turning inwards\nof these feelings, resulting in a suicide attempt or other self-damaging\nbehavior.\nHowever I would like to move away from these general points and try to\nget to grips with the notion that when there exists an "incapacity to bear\ndepression", we have reason to suspect a level of pathology having worrying\nimplications. In her distinguished paper on this topic Zetzel (1965) stressed\nthe adaptive value of certain manifestations of psychic distress when experienced\nand mastered in an appropriate developmental context. For instance,\ncertain partial solutions which were adequate for the latency child, were undermined\nby the onset of puberty, with resulting problems. And yet the very\npresence of these conflicts provided the individual with new opportunities for\nemotional growth. I am returning therefore to the question posed earliernamely,\nunder what conditions do we have valid theoretical or clinical\ngrounds to expect that the adolescent, in the process of adapting to the\n"losses" inevitable during this time of life, has access to sufficiently healthy\npsychological equipment to ensure adequate mastery over the inevitable\ndepression related to these adaptations?\nThe ability to form, and also, when necessary, to dissolve relationships is\nessential to human development. In his classic paper, "Mourning and Melancholia"\n(1917), Freud described the phenomenon of mourning as it occurs in\nadults in reaction to the death of a loved one. The pain of mourning was seen\nas having an invaluable adaptive function, since in the gradual process, major\nparts of the libido which were attached to the lost person, became free for use\nin other relationships in the world of the living. Bowlby (1961) posed the\nquestion as to stage of development and by means of what processes does the\nindividual arrive at a point in development which enables him to respond in a\nfavourable way to loss. He suggested that an early dating of this state was to be\ndoubted. In fact, the literature is replete with references to adult patients\nwho have lost parents in childhood or adolescence, who have just not expressed\ngrief, not accepted the reality of the loss and freeing of the libido has not\noccurred, i.e, childhood mourning had not occurred. On the other hand, some\nauthors advance the view that mourning is possible in childhood, Furman\n(1965) for instance, specifying pre-conditions such as the acquisition of a\nconcept of death and attainment of the stage of object constancy. Conclusive\nevidence however, would appear to be lacking but, we can ignore neither the\nextensive literature which reports on depression in adults who have suffered\nlosses \' in childhood, nor the various notable contributions by Robertson\n(1958), Bowlby (1961, 1963) and Freud, A. and Burlingham (1943) about the\neffects on children of briefseparations. It is interesting that some of the studies\nwhich confirmed most strongly the psychoanalytic view of the effect of loss or\n', "30Z R. DAKER\nseparation on children were those of Felix Brown(1961, and particularly 1966)\nand Dennehy (1966), whose extensive researches would appear to have put the\nrelationship between childhood bereavement and later depression beyond\ndoubt. Again, a study by Wolfenstein (1966), undertaken by psychoanalysts\nworking in a child guidance centre, reported that their adolescent or child\npatients did not mourn, curtailed feelings of sadness and showed little or no\nweeping responses. Significantly, there was apparently no withdrawal into\npreoccupations about the lost parent. Gradually, it emerged that these\nchildren were overtly or covertly denying the finality of the loss. This\nobservation suggests a developmental unreadiness to mourn; with the implica.\ntion that there may be some limitations in adolescents in their capacity to\nhandle the depression which is inevitable in response to losses incurred during\nthis period.\nNow to the question as to what developmental preconditions make mourning\npossible? Many writers have likened adolescence to mourning, for it is\nthen that normally a protracted and painful decathexis takes place, of those\nwho have been major love objects, i.e, the parents. It seems likely therefore\nthat adolescent separation is itself the precondition for the later capacity to\nmourn and serves as an initiation into how to mourn, how to give up a love\nobject, how to face depression. For instance, at all the earlier developmental\nstages, the parents are not given up as the major love objects, it is mainly the\nquality of the love that changes . In adolescence sexual maturation impels the\nadolescent to seek a sexual object. Normally, the incest barrier stands in the\nway of this being found in the parents, so that a new dilemma is experienced.\nDoes he withdraw his libido from the parents or renounce sexual fulfilment?\nEventually he decides in favour of ongoing life and the renunciation of the\npast. The detachment from the parents is a long and difficult struggle, the\nnew relationships often providing frustrations and disappointments, resulting\nin depressions which may push him back to the old objects. Abraham (19Il,\n1924) pointed out that depression is experienced not only in response to loss\nbut when there is an inability to love a person who was previously loved. This\nstate is present in the adolescent when his love for his parents declines. The\ngrief of th is stage has a quality which was not present earlier. But there are\ndifferences between the adolescent and the mourner, perhaps the most\nimportant being that the adolescent's renunciation is enforced due to internal\nconflict rather than an external event. Also, the adolescent usually is unaware\nthat the depression or sadness may be due to the loss of capacity to love the\nparents. While the mourner thinks of the lost object in an idealising way, the\nadolescent is in the process of devaluing the previously idealised parent. Thus\nthere are similarities and differences between adolescence and mourning. I\nwould submit however, that, where the work of adolescence remains incomplete,\nthe adult will remain unable to accomplish the work of mourning in\n", "ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION: ILLNESS OR DEVELOPMENTAL TASK? 303\nresponse to loss, and the capacity to handle or tolerate depression will be\nseriously undermined.\nIt is important, therefore, for the professional worker to keep in mind the\ndistinction between depressive-responses which are essentially reflections of\nmental health, and those which may foster development in the direction of\npathology. It is crucial that he is able to discern whether an adolescent can\nexperience optimal levels of depression, acknowledge feelings of depression in\nhimself, work them over in his mind (and I hasten to add, not necessarily\nshow them openly)-or whether he or she will resort to efforts which more or\nless deny, refute or block the conscious awareness of such feelings. With\nregard to the latter, I propose to briefly consider the question of self-damaging\nbehavior and suicide.\nIt is well known that adolescents in whom depression plays a central role,\nmanifestly or covertly, often display self-damaging behavior which may be\nseen as a direct expression of their feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and\ndespair. The most obvious manifestations of this are the frankly suicidal\nimpulses, such as wrist cutting, self-mutilation and so on. Actual suicide is at\nthe extreme end of a continuum covering a wide range of activities including,\nfor instance, sexual promiscuity (as a means of denying and running away\nfrom depressive feelings) or accident prone-ness (where there may be no\nevidence of manifest depression) or delinquent activities. nut to return to those\nadolescents whose self-damaging behavior directly expresses a response to\nlowered self-esteem and self-hatred, we must look into their inner world to\nlocate the roots of their mental pain. Such suffering may be caused by one of\ntwo basic internal situations, both of which results in lowered self-esteem:\n(I) the presence of a discrepancy between an adolescent's ideals, values and\nstandards and his actual manner of behaving or\n(2) the loss of somebody or something that was necessary for the maintenance\nof self-esteem-a loss for which the adolescent blames himself.\n\\Ve must not forget that there may be other factors which may predispose\nthe adolescent to depressive reactions which result in self-damaging behavior,\nmost notable of these being severe deprivations in early childhood, e.g, the\nloss of a parent or being the sole survivor of a family of concentration camp\nvictims. Psychoanalytic research has shown that for such adolescents, selfdamaging\nbehavior can be in the service of the need for self-punishment, for\nvery often they feel to blame for the losses and have to salve their guilt.\nfeelings by self-punishment or death. Indeed, in a research project undertaken\nat the Centre for Research into Adolescent Breakdown, London, one of the\nconclusive findings in the psychoanalytic treatment of a group of adolescents\nwho had made serious suicidal attempts was that such adolescents invite\nsituations to arise in their external lives which make them feel justified in\nwanting to die.\n", '30+ R. BAKER\nThere is no doubt that in dealing with deeply depressed adolescents, the\ninterviewer or psychotherapist is vulnerable to certain responses which\nmilitate against his ability to help the patient. I have already referred to the\n"cheer up" type of response, which even in the mildly depressed adolescent is\nfar from constructive, but in the very ill can be catastrophic. These adolescents\nare often so deeply depressed that they make us feel their despair to the\npoint that we feel hopeless about them. Such inner reactions may lead to\ndesperate measures, aimed at rescuing the adolescent, e.g. intense affectionate\nidentification with him. However, by far the most common intervention is to\nattack the depression, a response, which is only a variation on the "cheer up"\napproach. The truth, of course, is, that depression in others is not an easy\naffect to tolerate for long periods of time-it gets at other people, so to speak,\nand is therefore often felt as hostility. Thus, however well-meaning we may\nbe, there is a distinct tendency in all of us, because of the way we react against\nunpleasurable feelings in ourselves, to try to eliminate an adolescent\'s depression\nas quickly as possible. However, the adolescent may for various reasons\nresist interventions aimed at reducing his suffering-anger at and hatred of\nhimself being the most malignant and dangerous. But these feelings of hate\nand hostility are not only directed towards himself, but frequently also\ntowards those who love him or who may have loved him in the past, suicide\nbeing the clear expression of such an attack. Thus, we should be aware that\nthese very depressed adolescents will evoke in those who try to help them,\ncertain feelings which paradoxically go against such help being given. For\nexample, feelings of dislike, condemnation, criticism and, ultimately,\ncovert or even open rejection.\nThe research carried out at the Centre for Research into Adolescent\nBreakdown enabled a group of workers to compare their week to week psychoanalytic\nwork with severely depressed adolescents in the framework of a\nsupport network. Negative feelings were shared and this experience allowed\neach worker to put aside the negatives from the therapy itself, and prevent\nthem from contaminating the positive work. In this way negative feelings and\ntransferences could be turned to advantage and to the service of the adolescent,\nrather than interfering with potential therapy. I believe that such support\ngroups are of crucial importance for workers, however experienced, if they are\nto succeed in both helping adolescents and surviving the rigours of their\ntreatment, in particular the potentially destructive counter-transferences\nwhich are inevitably fostered. I consider that these counter-transference\nfeelings provide clinical pointers that should direct our attention to the\ndeeply serious nature of an adolescent\'s depression and would submit that,\nother things being equal, the presence of such powerful reactions in a professional\nworker, might suggest that we are seeing illness rather than develop-\nmental task.\n', 'ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION: ILLNESS OR DEVELOPMENTAL TASK? 305\nLooking at normality and pathology from a comparative viewpoint, it is\napparent that there will inevitably be areas of confusion and overlap. The fact\nthat psychoanalysts have tended to approach normality from the study of\npathology would appear to be especially valid in relation to depression in\nadolescence. In our contemporary society we have seen major changes in what\nis acceptable as normality, in the past 10 years. In a recent conference on\nAdolescent Sexuality (Baker, 19i8; Laufer, 1978; Wilson, 1978), the speakers\nwere severely criticised when they suggested that homosexuality and promiscuity\nwere manifestations of pathology or abnormal development. If this\ntrend were to develop to a point where an adolescent who wished to die and\nmade successful or unsuccessful attempts to end his life, were to be deemed\n"normal" we would indeed have reached a grotesque state of sickness in our\nsociety. Unfortunately such views do exist and depression which is grossly\npathological is explained in terms of its justifiable response to the oppression\nof society, external circumstances, political ideas, and so on. In my view, it is\nimportant that these views are vigilantly opposed and the roots of depression\nplaced squarely in the inner world of the adolescent and its antecedants. Only\nthen will we feel that we can offer the adolescent help which he will not see as\neither self-destruction or destruction of society.\nI will conclude with some of the findings of the above mentioned study of\nseven adolescents who attempted suicide at least once and who, at the time of\nthe attempt, hoped to die. All had been preoccupied with morbid thoughts\nabout death for a considerable time prior to the suicide attempt. Their\nrelationships with their mothers were characterised by dependence and hostility,\nwith considerable inability to function without her. The push towards\nindependence thus created massive conflict which was reinforced by leaving\nschool, having to go to University, etc. The pressure to make a decision,\nbecome independent and separate from parents reached intolerable levels.\nThese adolescents invariably carried with them feelings of inadequacy and\nfailure from their childhoods, again related to the nature of the oppressive\nrelationship with the mother. The pressure to make sexual relationships was\ntoo great, or the relationships became a replica of the earlier dependent one\nwith the mother, which again evoked feelings of failure in the adolescent. The\nnext phase was the adolescent\'s searchfor somebody to blame, an attempt to\nlocate the cause of his or her failure in the outside world. The mother was\nfrequently the focus of their hositility, but in the boy, his hatred of the mother\nremained unconscious and he displaced his anger into the external world\nwhere he created a situation of being rejected by a friend, girl-friend, school,\nwork, etc. The girl, on the other hand did experience a break-through \' of\nhatred towards the mother, and if she experienced confirmation of the\npotency of her hostile feelings through illness, or hospitalisation of the mother\nshe was driven into a panic. Then suicide is the next step-the only way out of\n', "306 R. BAKER\nthe conflict. A suicide plan carries with it certain characteristics, in particular\nfantasies that the subject will force his object to love him, to be sympathetic,\nto show guilt, to feel sorry. He intends to die but somewhere he denies his\ndeath. Further, there is little or no conscious thought of the effect of his death\non his parents-he doesn't consider the pain that his death will cause them.\nImmediately following the suicidal act, he will feel calm, relieved and released\nfrom tensions.\nThe pattern described is pathology and illness; completion of the developmental\ntask has been impossible; the adolescent has been overwhelmed. One\nof the most important features is that the adolescent may court a rejection in\nthe'outside world, which will justify his already conceived unconscious plan.\nThe therapist must guard against his counter-transferences making him the\nrejector, i.e, the object onto whom the hostility to the mother is displaced.\nREFERENCES\nAbraham, K.
