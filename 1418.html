        <pre>['Cultural threads in three primary schools\nIntroducing a critical cosmopolitan frame\nPatricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\nCanterbury Christ Church University\nThis paper explores headteachers’ and teachers’ perceptions of foreign languages(FL)\nand cultural learning in three primary schools in areas of dis-\nadvantage in England. Drawing upon a new theoretical frame for primary\nlanguages, Critical Cosmopolitanism (Delanty, 2006; Beck and Sznaider,\n2006) and The Grammar of Culture (Holliday, 2018), we argue that the\ngrand narrative of a target language inhabited by a target culture is outdated\nand approaches to cultural learning in primary schools could lead\nthe way. There is substantial evidence that most learners find language\nlessons fun, particularly activities such as songs, stories and intercultural\nevents (Driscoll et al., 2004, 2014; Cable et al. 2010). The discourse on conditions\nfor inclusive practice is less commonplace and little is known about\nFL learning in areas of high deprivation (Nikolov & Mihaljević\nDjigunović, 2011). Teachers and headteachers in this study were committed\nto cultural learning and staff adopted creative approaches to teaching. The\nfindings, however, also indicate that traditional notions of a mono or\nhomogenised national culture with associated stereotypes linger in teachers’\nframing of FL. There exists a need for a more personalised approach to\ncultural learning drawing upon children’s own cultural experiences. Data\nwas analysed thematically following strict ethical guidelines and all names\nwere anonymised to ensure confidentiality.\nKeywords: primary languages, foreign languages, critical cosmopolitanism,\ncultural learning, disadvantaged coastal regions\nIntroduction\nThe discussion of primary school language education connects with a wider issue\nof the relationship between language and culture. In the opening sections we\ntherefore present these issues within the particularly poignant critical cosmopolitan\nframe which questions everything we have commonly thought about language\nhttps://doi.org/10.1075/aila.00021.dri\nAILA Review Volume 32 (2019), pp. 64–90. issn 1461-0213 | e‑issn 1570-5595\nThis work is licensed under a license.\n', 'education. This study considers the cultural offer provided by three schools to\nyoung children, primarily in relation to foreign languages but also across the curriculum\nas a whole. This study has been undertaken within the context of ‘Brexit’\nand the divide across the UK, created by the referendum of 2016, where UK citizens\nvoted whether to stay or leave the European Union. Who is part of the\n‘homeland’ and British, and who is not became part of the political campaign with\nissues about language, heritage and culture highlighted with divisive intent.\nLanguages was made statutory from the age of seven in English primary\nschools in September 2013. In secondary schools it is a statutory subject from the\nage of 11 to 14. A clear intention for cultural and intercultural experiences is woven\nthroughout the purpose of study for foreign languages in the National Curriculum:\n‘Learning a foreign language is a liberation from insularity and provides an\nopening to other cultures. A high-quality languages education should foster pupils’\ncuriosity and deepen their understanding of the world.’ (Department for Education,\n2013). The implication is that studying a foreign language is a deeply transformative\nexperience, which, as long as it is not associated with a narrow view of culture,\nwill help liberate learners from a blinkered ‘world view’ of their own culture, or\nfrom being locked into an essentialist view of the world.\nA growing body of literature exists about teaching foreign languages, however,\nin the UK, there is still limited work in schools in disadvantaged areas. This study\nby contrast offers some insight into the language and cultural offer of schools in\n‘disadvantaged’ coastal areas. One primary school is situated in a rural workingclass\narea on a peninsula, surrounded on all three sides by water. The other two\nschools are situated on large urban estates in coastal towns. Most pupils are of\nWhite British heritage. Two of the schools have an above average or well-above\naverage proportion of disadvantaged pupils (supported by the pupil premium\nwhich provides additional government funding for free school meals). Ethical\nconsiderations were followed.\nContext of the study\nAccording to recent evidence from the Sutton Trust, White Working Class are the\nworst performing ethnic group in UK (Kirby & Cullinane, 2016). This research\nhighlights the exam results at the age of 16 and argues that only 28% of students\non free school meals (FSM) achieve five good GCSEs and that white birth pupils\nare the least likely of all pupils to attend university. The principal finding of the\nlatest Language Trends survey (Tinsley and Dolezal, 2018), highlights the inequity\nof language learning at school. Secondary schools in disadvantaged areas tend to\ndedicate a shorter amount of curriculum time to languages and fewer students\nCultural threads in three primary schools 65\n', 'opt to take foreign languages at the national GCSE examination at the age of 16.\nThe report indicates that over one third of state schools report that whole groups\nof students are not taught languages in Year 9. Evidence about foreign languages\nis bleak, particularly in disadvantaged areas, where student attainment overall in\nnational examinations, at the age of 16 and 18 is a serious cause for concern. In\nrelation to primary schools, the survey shows that languages remain a marginalised\nsubject due to other competing demands of the curriculum.\nWhere attainment is below the national average, pressure can build in schools\nto focus more heavily on a diet of English, Literacy and Mathematics. A greater\nproportion of curriculum time is allocated to these core subjects leaving all other\nsubjects competing for time and emphasis. Despite prioritising the core subjects\nin primary and secondary school, recent research by the Children’s Commissioner\nfor England reports that nearly 100,000 young people leave education at\nthe age of 18 without substantive qualifications (Longfield, 2019). The number\nof children receiving free school meals without appropriate qualifications for\nemployment or further study when they leave school, increased from 28% to 37%\nover the last few years. These statistics represent nearly 100,000 individuals and\nnumbers are rapidly rising. The corresponding attainment gap between those that\nhave and those that do not, is rising.\nSchools reducing languages are more likely to have a higher proportion of students\noffered free school meals (Tinsley & Dolezal, 2018). A number of coastal\nareas across the UK are sites of major disadvantage, particularly those that are\nnot connected, through effective infrastructure, to vibrant economically successful\ntowns. There is, however, a paucity of research about young people in coastal\nareas, rather research about disadvantage primarily focuses on inner cities (Reid\n& Westergaard, 2017). Reid and Westergaard’s research indicates that growing up\nin a coastal town has a significant impact on participants’ lives in relation to the\ndecisions they make, their perceptions of the barriers they face, the challenges\nand the factors that influence the choices they make. Inner-city areas, they argue,\nhave a 360-degree outlook, whereas coastal towns are restricted to a 180-degree\nperspective with the sea on one side of the landmass. The study focused on\ncareer opportunities and how they are limited but the question arises about the\nyoung in primary school and how they perceive their culture and opportunities.\nIf indeed foreign languages as a curriculum subject, is a ‘liberation from insularity’\n(Department for Education, 2014) and cultivates such cultural advantages, why is\nit so marginalised for children who arguably would benefit the most.\nAn important study recently published by the British Academy presents a systematic\nreview of international evidence (Woll & Wei, 2019). The review follows\nthe adopted Cochrane-approach to reviewing literature, which, answers specific\nresearch questions by identifying, evaluating and synthesising all the empirical\n66 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'evidence against eligibility criteria. In other words, evidence is ‘weighed’ for quality\nrather than a narrative review which, can be more selective in what is included\nand excluded from an academic paper. A range of key stakeholders or users were\ninterviewed about their perceptions of language learning. The report questioned\nthe relationship between language learning, learners’ academic achievements and\nthe cognitive benefits of learning a foreign language as well as how schools use\nlanguages as part of an overall suite of experiences to encourage, enliven and\nenrich children’s lives. Their evidence suggests that benefits of studying a new\nlanguage improves attention and mental alertness after only one week of study.\nThey selected two major themes for the meta-analysis: the relationship of language\nlearning and academic achievement across the curriculum and the influ-\nence on creativity. They found that 90% of studies report a positive impact on\nlearning across English language, literacy, maths and science, while the remaining\n10% show no impact; these studies include learners from a variety of countries,\ndifferent language combinations, and varied socio-economic backgrounds.\nWhy then are languages marginalised in schools in many areas of disadvantage?\nIt is not within the remit of this paper to interrogate the blatant and hor-\nrible inequality of the English education system, rather, this paper pivots around\ntwo competing narratives regarding how schools manage the cultural and intercultural\ndevelopment within an educational setting, and the role of foreign lan-\nguages in a school’s cultural offer now that the subject is a legal requirement for\nall children from the age of 7.\nEssentialist language and culture narrative\nThe first, more established narrative, which we consider to be problematic, relates\nto a grand narrative of language and culture, in which the target language is considered\nto inhabit or be inhabited by a target culture which is as alien to the\nchild as the language itself. An immediate implication is that children are led to\na polarised, ‘us’ and ‘them’ belief that they are learning ‘another culture’ with a\ncontent of values and behaviours that is as essentially different to their own as the\nvocabulary and grammar of the target language. This narrative is critiqued in a\nnumber of ways from the perspective of what has been termed by some a critical\ncosmopolitan narrative of culture.\nCultural threads in three primary schools 67\n', 'Critical cosmopolitan narrative\nThe critical cosmopolitan narrative recognises complexity and fluidity in social\nprocesses and the multiple ways through which the social world is constructed in\ndifferent contexts with different types of modernity (Delanty, 2006) and acknowledges\nthat cultural realities are built at an individual level around individual’s\npersonal circumstances that dissolve structural and spatial boundaries (Beck &\nSznaider, 2006; Holliday, 2011). This paper intends to relate this understanding of\ncomplex and fluid social processes to the nature of the intercultural experience for\nlanguage learners who attend primary schools. Gerd Baumann’s (1996) ethnography\nof the London Borough of Southall, is interesting here, his references to cul-\nture are multiple and creative, dependent on who is speaking to whom and about\nwhat. Individuals who live within a community have very different identities – the\npopulation is diverse, even though they may be categorised within the notion of\nWhite British.\nIdeological construction\nOne of the tenets of critical cosmopolitanism is the postmodern understanding\nthat grand narratives of nation and history are ideological (Lyotard, 1979,p. xxiv).\nIt tells us that the concept of nation state is not defined by culture and language,\nbut by a political construct that employs exaggerated constructs of culture and\nlanguage to provide it with validity. The positivist, modernist view of culture as a\nhomogeneous whole is therefore replaced with the view that it is hybrid, shifting,\nimagined and ideologically constructed. There are two important things to note\nhere. First, this critical cosmopolitan understanding represents a scientific revolution\nfrom which we cannot return rather than an alternative understanding that\nwe might choose (Kuhn, 1970). Second, thinking of cultures as essentially different\nhomogenous blocks is an ideological position that distorts how things really\nare. While not all ideology might be ‘ideas serving as weapons for social interests’\n(Berger & Luckmann,1979, p. 18), in the case of language and culture the grand\nnarratives of nation have had a particularly negative impact because they have\nencouraged divisive views about people and speakerhood (Kumaravadivelu, 2012)\nas we explain in the next section.\n68 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'Cultural prejudice\nThis negative impact of ideologies of nation in language education concerns\ncultural prejudice that moves towards neo-racism. It is driven by an obsession\nwith national or civilisational cultures which has led to a false belief that they are\nthe prime defining factor in linguistic and cultural difference. The reason for this\ncomes from a combination of forces: a ‘methodological nationalism’ – i.e. always\nbeginning comparative social research with national categories – resulting from\nthe upsurge of nationalism in Europe in the 19th century (e.g. Beck & Sznaider,\n2006, p. 3); the influence of behaviourism that implies that learning language\nmeans learning culture (Holliday, 2005,p. 55); and a deep-seated Orientalism and\nhistorical colonialism where the West has defined the non-West as culturally\ndeficient (e.g. Hall, 1991; Said, 1978), which has morphed into an apparently ‘wellwishing’\nbut still deeply patronising West as steward discourse of improving the\nworld through cultural education (Holliday, 2011, 2016a). An outcome of these\nforces is that ’culture’ is never a neutral term; and attempting to define any\ngroup of people by means of cultural stereotypes is neo-racist, with ‘culture’ as a\neuphemism for race (e.g. Hervik, 2013; Spears, 1999).\nThe monolingual, monocultural fallacy\nA further problematic aspect of the obsession with essentially separate and\nhomogenous national or civilisational cultures has been the way in which they\nhave been further simplified and exaggerated as a commercial brand in the international\nlanguage textbook industry (Gray, 2010). This commodification of cul-\nture has encouraged an essentialist multiculturalism in which people are reduced\nto images of costumes, food, festivals, fairs, folklore and statistical facts (Kramsch,\n1993; Cantle, 2012; Delanty, Wodak, & Jones, 2008; Dervin, Hahl, Härkönen, &\nLayne, 2015; Kubota, 2004; Kumaravadivelu, 2007, pp. 104–106). In the case of language\neducation, this list of images, idiomatic expressions, descriptions of cultural\nevents and situations and very particular cultural values, lead teachers and students\nto believe that they define the language that they are learning (Kullman,\n2013; Risager, 2018).\nTeachers and students, to counter this idea, only need to think about the\nsociolinguistics of their own societies to know that idiomatic expression is a particularly\nvariable aspect of language as it moves and changes within small cul-\nture scenarios and that there is a huge diversity of cultural events and situations.\nLooking to one’s own experience in this way rather than being taken in by the\nCultural threads in three primary schools 69\n', 'recipes provided by grand narratives will be a recurring theme throughout the\nrest of this paper.\nThis simplistic matching of nation, language and culture can also encourage\nlanguage teachers to frame their academic identity around very narrow interpretations\nof ‘culture’. Language teachers in primary schools bring significant exper-\ntise – both specialist and generalist, albeit in different ways, however, without any\nparticular background in sociology, history or cultural studies, their expertise can\nbe quite narrow; with the result that children are given tiny slices of social life\nselected by writers and publishers of resources and a narrow impression of the\nrelationship between language and culture. Cultural references within resources\nand teaching materials are reduced to products, fixed forever and isolated rather\nthan in flux and mutually dependent. Misconceptions can arise (Driscoll et al,\n2013), which are further exacerbated when these false images of language and culture\nare squeezed into the limited repertoire of classrooms Driscoll, 2014; Driscoll\net al., 2014.\nMoving from blocks to thread\nWhat has so far been described are the blocks to the teaching and learning of language\nthat arise from false notions of language and culture. In contrast, we rec-\nommend a more inclusive pedagogy that employs language learning to seek out\nintercultural threads that bring us together. This implies a more realistic and open\nimage of language and culture, with deeper, more worthwhile outcomes that avoid\ncultural prejudice. Threads are the counter to grand narratives when they connect\nus back to the personal experience of language and culture that we all bring with\nus but which we might not easily recall.\nHelpful here is Holliday’s grammar of culture (2018) which shows how blocks\nand threads compete within the complex nature of the intercultural and in the\neveryday process of small culture formation on the go (Amadasi & Holliday, 2017;\nHolliday, 2016b; Holliday & Amadasi, 2020). It is important to note that the use of\n‘grammar’ here is not in the linguistic sense, but rather from C Wright Mills’ Sociological\nimagination (1970,p. 235). He claims it as the basic method for detailed\nsense-making of the structures of society. It is the sociological rather than linguistic\nanalysis running through this paper that is able to bring out the cultural poli-\ntics of language education. The grammar depicts three broad domains, each with\nnegative and positive forces. The positive are threads that we can choose to use to\nbring us together. The negative are the blocks that keep us apart and build cultural\nprejudice.\n70 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'The first domain, national and other structures, is most often associated with\nnation or other things that structure our lives such as education, the media, political\nsystems, economies, institutions and perhaps religion. Within this domain,\nthere are certainly elements that can provide us with huge resources when engaging\nwith new languages or cultural environments. It is these resources that would\nenable language teachers and learners to bring a background and understanding\nof how language works in society to the learning of language. However, there are\nalso blocking grand narratives that come to us through our media and politics\nthat can demonise the Other – propaganda about other nations, and especially,\nthese days, about migrants and minorities, or about people we are at war with, are\nobvious examples. In this sense, no talk of culture can ever be neutral because we\nare all brought up, consciously or unconsciously, to position ourselves as either\nsuperior or inferior to others. It is in this domain that we can be fed false notions\nthat ‘our’ large culture and language is essentially culturally separate and different\nto ‘theirs’ – a notion that will by its nature carry an implication of inferiority or\nsuperiority and of how we need to be behaviouristically trained in the other culture\nin order to enter it.\nThe second domain, cultural products, mostly has positive, threading impact\nin that there are cultural flows that are carried across structural borders – art, literature,\nmusic, architecture, cuisine, fashion and so on. There is however a neg-\native, blocking force in this domain in the form of discourses of culture which\nmake essentialist statements and claim ‘us / them’ boundaries – ‘in my culture we\nalways … and never …’. These, and the ‘us / them’ grand narratives on the right of\nthe grammar are the basis of the essentialist and neo-racist imaginations of language\nand culture described above.\nThe third domain, underlying universal cultural processes, is potentially the\nmajor source of threads in that they are what we all share in the way that we\nengage with and construct culture, wherever we are, from a very early age. It is\nthese processes that are shared across languages. It is here that language learners\ncan broaden their horizons by identifying with how other languages also make\nmeaning, and therefore understand better how they themselves make meaning.\nThis sharing of experience and complexity is the basis for the suggestions for\nthreads in the rest of the paper. However, without careful teacher guidance this\ncontinuous process of small culture formation on the go in the experience of\nanother language can revert to the reinforcing of the blocks of distrust, suspicion\nand cultural prejudice as described above.\nCultural threads in three primary schools 71\n', 'A richer picture\nWhat therefore is the relationship between language and culture that we can\nwork with to create threads that bring us together in a more open teaching and\nlearning experience? Answering the question is helped by a now developing consensus\nwithin critical applied linguistics and critical sociology that the relation-\nship between language and culture is complex and far from one where nations,\ntheir cultures and their languages map neatly into each other (Saraceni, 2015).\nBoth language and culture are entities that can travel creatively and independently\nof each other. Neither can be pinned down as tradition has imagined that\nthey can. The common notion that teaching a ‘target language’ matches precisely\nonto teaching a ‘target culture’ is therefore fallacious. The use of the term ‘target’\nis itself problematic where it suggests a definable place to go to, learn and master.\nA language does not speak one particular culture rather it embraces a diverse\nrange of cultural realities.\nAll languages are constantly changing to take in the diverse cultural flows –\nthe carrying of cultural influences from one place to another. The notion of linguacultural\nis useful to explain the relationship between language and cultural\nflows. The term comes from Risager, who states that it is a cultural ‘language\nresource’ which can be carried from its language of origin to other languages. For\nexample, ‘people carry their Danish language resources with them into new cultural\ncontexts and perhaps put them to use in new ways under new circumstances’\n(2011, p. 107). She continues: ‘when I as a Dane move around the world, I tend to\nbuild on my Danish linguacultural, when I speak English, French or German. I\ntherefore contribute to the flow of Danish linguacultural across languages’ (p. 110).\nChildren, of course, rarely travel without adults to support and protect them.\nTheir encounters, should they travel, are therefore more mediated through the\nlocal or home language. At home however, young pupils travel between the home\nculture, school culture and other places outside of the home both with different\ndomestic cultures and organisational cultures, in the world outside. As such, they\ntoo, carry their language resource as they move around their world.\nSearching for threads\nThinking about cultural flows and how language can express a range of cultural\nexperiences and references, one of the important thread benefits of FL is carrying\nexperience from one language to another – even at the early stages of language\nlearning (Driscoll et al., 2014). A new language will undoubtably connect with cultural\nexperiences that one’s own language does not, but it will be an experience\n72 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'that one can nevertheless bring into one’s own cultural domain. Cultural threads\ncan also be carried from the home culture to the school culture and back again.\nThus, children’s cultural understanding is an ongoing, complex and dynamic\nprocess.\nAnother set of threads are the specialist discourses. These are the ways of talking\nabout things that are specific to particular activities such as football, cricket or\ndance or within the medical profession and most importantly for young people,\nwith specialist curriculum discourses. These discourses are connected with small\ncultures and will be similar in different cultural settings. For example, Mathematics\nmay be taught in different ways across the world but the specialist curriculum\ndiscourse is similar.\nThroughout the learning process, children could be encouraged to pull\nthreads from their personal cultural trajectories to make sense, adapt and innovate.\nThey could be encouraged to externalise and transfer their existing knowl-\nedge of language, the curriculum and their understanding of the political and\nsocial world in other words the grand and personal narratives that surround\nthem. Recent demonstrations about climate change and an end to the age of fossil\nfuel, led by school children and joined by millions of students and workers worldwide,\nis a case in point. Children and young people are connected globally and\nthey are interested in subjects and topics that make meaning and make sense\nin terms of their lives, as they are living it and their life in the future as they\nsee it. Gong & Holliday (2013), in their work with secondary students in China,\nfound that students asked for less superficial ‘culture specific’ content in language\nlessons, but instead to have ‘something meaningful for their lives, includ-\ning stories which may give them guidance for their futures’ (pp. 48–9). Baraldi\n& Lervese’s (2017) study of ‘the interactional production of narratives of children’s\nmemories during a series of workshops in Italian “multicultural” class-\nrooms’ in ‘one primary school and two secondary schools in an Italian town’\n(p. 398) showed ‘the children’s epistemic authority in producing their own narratives\nand telling their personal experiences and views’ (p. 414).\nFor children living in one area and going to school within the neighbourhood,\nthe flow of ‘linguaculture’, from their home culture to their school culture\nand across the various online devices that connect them to the wider world,\nif nurtured within a pedagogic frame, could be of immense value to children’s\ncultural development. Rather than emphasizing separate languages and cultures\nand language learning as a separated activity, teachers have the potential to\nforge strong cultural threads through the curriculum. Conteh, (2012,p. 114), in\nan ethnographic study of bilingual children’s concept of funds of knowledge,\nexplored children’s learning experiences at home, in the community and at\nschool. She argues that schools and classrooms should be places where ‘threads,\nCultural threads in three primary schools 73\n', 'strands and fibres of global, national and local discourses are dialectically mediated\nand dialogically played out in the interactions between teachers and learn-\ners.’ We suggest that schools have the potential to provide learning spaces where\nchildren develop a fluid and flexible cultural literacy to understand themselves,\nothers and the world. Rather than linguaculture being solely a useful concept\nfor different people carrying language into new cultural contexts, it could be the\nimpetus for children moving between cultures within their own world.\nSome meta-analysis or critical reflection of the curriculum content included\nwithin the foreign language, particularly that which represents blocking grand\nnarratives and discourses of culture, can help children question these narratives\nand discourses in resources and teaching materials. Arguably, in primary schools,\nwhere one class teacher teaches most or all subjects, this critique of blocking\nnarratives could take place across the curriculum. The ability of children to critique\ncultural texts and find their own critical meaning through their practice\nof agency is illustrated by Canagarajah’s (1999, pp.88–90) iconic example of Sri\nLankan secondary school children scribbling their own stories about South-Asian\nfilm heroes and heroines into the margins of their American English language\ntextbook, out of sight of the teacher. Canagarajah later notes that these hidden\nexpressions of creativity were often written in English that was better than the\nEnglish language that the students presented to their teachers for assessment.\nThese scribbled stories are essentially cosmopolitan in the way that they relate to\nthe wider world. They are the things that are ‘relatively free from surveillance’ and\ncan also include such things as ‘asides between students, passing of notes, small\ngroup interactions, peer activities, marginalia in textbooks and notebooks, transition\nfrom one teacher to another, before classes begin, after classes are officially\nover’. Canagarajah notes that ‘students can make almost any site in the educational\nenvironment free from surveillance by colluding in constructing a culture\nof underlife behaviour’ (2004, p.221).\nInterculturality\nA further area where threads can be found is within the concept of interculturality.\nThis term has been used in recent years to depict the quality that enables positive\nand creative intercultural engagement. An established definition is ‘a dynamic\nprocess by which people draw on and use the resources and processes of cultures\nwith which they are familiar but also those they may not typically be associated\nwith in their interactions with others’ (Young & Sercombe, 2010,p. 181). Dervin\n(2016, pp. 103–106) says that it is a highly creative quality that requires the reflexive\nand uncertain work of digging beneath the surface of discourses and politics. The\n74 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'reflexive and creative nature of interculturality is at the core of the underlying\nuniversal cultural processes domain of the grammar, however, as with the other\naspects of this domain, it needs to be drawn away from the essentialist idea that\ninvolves looking from one bounded national culture (e.g. English) to another (e.g.\nFrench, German or Spanish), and being satisfied with tolerance or understanding\nof an essentially foreign Other still within a divisive ‘us / them’ frame.\nLearning another language provides important opportunities for a creative\nand searching interculturality analysis inherent in seeking to find ourselves within\nthe cultural lives of others. This is by no means straight forward but through\nteaching reflectively and reflexively teachers can support this process pedagogically.\nIn the specific case of language, it is through heightening understanding and\nawareness of how language works. It is an entry point into a specific language and\na particular society, at the same time understanding that this is not all that either\nthe society or the language can be. In this sense, language is part of the architecture\nof social life that can be expressed in other ways. The language and the soci-\nety are each far bigger than the other.\nThere have been similar discussions about third spaces and hybridity with\nregard to language learning. The old, essentialist idea is to do with intermediate\nspaces or impure or fractured identities that are there because of problematic,\noften cultural boundaries between one language and another (Fairclough, 2006;\nHolliday, 2018; Kumaravadivelu, 2007). Rather, if we think instead of more open\nand creative interpretations (Bhabha, 1994; Guilherme, 2002; Hall, 1996; Holliday,\n2018a) – that all of us, everywhere, are multiple in our cultural histories and\nidentity, then the learning and teaching of language becomes a massive opportunity\nfor dissolving borders and exploring even further who we all are – another\nway of finding ourselves in others. The following extract from a primary school\ntextbook for English in Iran, reflects this perspective:\nTurtles are patient and curious, they take their time in water and land, they never\nworry about where to stay or where to rest because they walk with their homes\non their backs! I feel our memories are like their homes on their backs – the\nmemories we carry to wherever we go. The Turtle in our stories travels to different\nplaces, she talks to different people, she tells us about other people’s stories,\n(Ghahremani-Ghajar, 2009,p. 1)that are usually my/our stories too!\nThis is not to argue for a global monoculture rather, a recognition that we ae all\nsimilar, each in our own way before we are foreign, strange or different. The point\nis that when we experience new or strange cultures, we should look for and as\nteachers highlight the familiar. Turtles are referenced because we would always\nthink of them being turtles first, before we consider their differences.\nCultural threads in three primary schools 75\n', 'Methodology\nA strong implication of the critical cosmopolitan approach is that the data itself\ncan be interpreted in different ways. By simply applying the ethnographic discipline\nof ‘making the familiar strange’, empowered by the critical cosmopolitan\nperspective, we offer perhaps unexpected interpretations that are necessarily\nhighly critical of all our professional practice. We identify fully with the hardworking\nteachers in this study and appreciate how hard it is to break away from\nthe structures with which we all have to work. We nevertheless feel that we can all\nbenefit from another way of looking.\nThe study is an interpretive study in three primary schools in coastal areas.\nOne primary school situated on a peninsula, with a strong local identity, another\non a large estate, well-known locally, regionally and nationally as an area of high\ndeprivation with limited mobility of families and the third – a large primary academy\nschool on the coast with limited opportunities for employment. Most pupils\nare of White British heritage. All the schools have an above average or well-above\naverage proportion of disadvantaged pupils, supported by the pupil premium\n(additional government funding for FSM) and / or a high proportion of children\nwith special educational needs.\nInterviews with the three Headteachers provided evidence about their priorities\nand the place of foreign languages within the school since statutory status, the\nschool’s offer in terms of cultural development, and how foreign languages weaves\nthrough the school’s cultural and international portfolio. Interviews were audio\nrecorded and all names of people, places and schools anonymised. Ethical considerations\nwere applied to all parts of the study. Interviews with three teachers\ngave a sense of how teachers incorporate cultural experiences and cultural learning\nwithin the curriculum on a daily or weekly basis. The data was scrutinised\nthrough a thematic analysis.\nFindings\nA recurring theme though headteacher and teacher interviews was a deep commitment\nfor children’s cultural development and the importance of developing\ntolerance and empathy. Staff across all three schools shared their desire to give\nchildren cultural experiences, not only in FLs but across the whole curriculum\nthat the children might otherwise ‘miss’:\n…. There is a general desire amongst the staff to want to give the children more\ncultural experience… It’s more of a driving force than the national curriculum. We\n76 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'want them to be rounded people. Some parents are against foreign cultures, you\nhear some children talk about foreigners so you want them to be more informed.\nA large section of the children here, have very limited cultural experiences in terms\nof the places they might go to, the people they might meet, the things they might see\nand so, as a staff we are aware of that, and we want to give them experiences of\ndifferent art, different cultures, different music, we want to take them to the theatre.\nStaff in school B\nFL was perceived as part of the cultural activities that schools offered to enrich\nchildren’s lives. One teacher explained, for example, that foreign languages dovetails\ninto the school’s vision and ethos about cultural education and teaching\nabout diversity.\nI think us raising the profile of foreign languages in school … that’s been part of …\nthings that we’ve done around improving the cultural education … part of the package,\nto improve their cultural understanding and their cultural awareness.\nTeacher School C\nOne unifying factor in all three schools was the limited experience that most children\nhave outside of the area and how rarely (if at all) some children go to the\nlocal town or even to the water’s edge. One teacher (School B) explained that there\nare few influences from ‘outside’, that some children rarely move off the estate\nuntil the school trip to the local castle or cathedral in Year 5 or 6. Some of the\nchildren have not visited the seaside despite the short distance of the coastline\nfrom their homes. The importance of a culturally rich curriculum shone through\nin many conversations with teachers and headteachers. In each school, teachers\nreported that in recent years fewer children go on holiday. Teachers and headteachers\nspoke about extending children’s tolerance in all manner of experiences,\nas one headteacher recalled:\nI sit down and have lunch with the children whenever I can and I was with the Y4\nchildren and I said ‘what would happen if a new friend in your class arrived and\nthey were a Muslim, how would you react?’ And they sort of looked at me bewildered.\n‘We would treat them like friends and treat them like everyone else. Why\nwould that be different?’ I thought great, just testing it out. It means we’re getting\nHeadteacherthis right if the children aren’t bemused by that….\nThe headteacher from School B spoke about cultural threads and how the concept\nof tolerance weaves through the whole school:\nIt’s complex it’s not taught as a distinct thread…because it threads through everything.\nWe look at partnerships locally, …comes through the incidental work…We\ndon’t want to be in a place where we all agree with one another, that’s not healthy.\nIt grows into that concept of tolerance and understanding and respect for another\nCultural threads in three primary schools 77\n', 'person’s point of view, that might be different and you don’t have to agree but to\naccept them is important.\nTwo of the headteachers highlighted the importance of balancing a sense of locale\npride and developing children’s understanding of possibilities away from home.\nAs on Head said:\n…We are …in a rural location…isolated. …there are some children here that\nhaven’t been off the peninsula, apart from when we’ve taken them off…. (FL) gives\nthem that sense of there’s more to life than my little community…a better sense of\nself. …they feel very proud …We’ve also done a lot of work about the different herHeadteacher\nAitages in the school…\nDovetailing a vision of broadening children’s perceptions and curiosity about the\nworld with travel, exchanges and international experiences and helping to enrich\nchildren’s sense of identity and belonging to their local cultures could create tensions\nand challenges. One headteacher explained he had wanted to create as many\nlinks, exchanges and visits as possible to help develop children’s cultural experiences:\nI’m passionate about travelling – and I want them to develop a passion too.\nHe explained the importance of balance between the two seemingly contradictory\nviewpoints. While discussing this issue, he shared an anecdote from a staff meeting,\nwhere he had been talking about visits and exchanges:\n…But a turning point was at one staff meeting some of the TAs said: “What’s the\nmatter with the estate, this is cultural, we have lived here all our lives, what are you\nsaying about our culture and the culture of the children. My parents and grandparHeadteacher\nBents have all lived their lives on the estate”.\nOne of the teachers spoke about this incident and reported that staff need to take\ngreat care when speaking about broadening children’s horizons, so as not to give\noffence, or imply that living on the estate is undesirable. She explained that the\nstaff do not want to ‘devalue’ children and that there is a need\n… to strike a balance between celebrating … children’s own culture and also widening\nout (children’s mindsets) to what it is to be British. …. we have our annual cul-\ntural celebration day, one class do England… Scotland, Wales, Ireland. As well as\nthe other countries … we had 14 other countries celebrated…. Reception class made\nLondon buses out of junk models, they made tea, and …some trifle. …\nTeacher in school B\nInterestingly, it is unlikely that children in Reception class in this school, who\nare aged 4 and 5, would have been to London to see a bus or would drink tea.\nNotions of national culture inherent within the curriculum arose in conversations\nwith headteachers and teachers irrespective of the nation under discussion.\n78 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'That said, when celebrating the children’s own local heritage in their neighbourhoods,\nteachers took care to consult with children, parents and grandparents. A\ncase in point, was in School ‘A’ on the peninsula. The headteacher and staff across\nthe school developed a small research project for children to find out from their\nparents, grandparents and great grandparents when their family had arrived on\nthe peninsula and to gather stories about their activities and work. As children\ndelved into the biographies of their own families over three or four generations,\nit became apparent that what appeared to be homogeneity on the surface, in relation\nto White British, in fact, veiled a multitude of difference. Staff gathered flags\ndepicting each child’s heritage from the counties and countries of their family.\nAll flags were hung in the hall to celebrate difference, individual cultures and to\nshow how people had settled on the peninsula from different places over generations.\nAny new children to the school were either connected to an existing flag\nor another flag was sourced to represent their heritage. The headteacher (School\nA) explained that the school uses the resources that they have and with few influences\nfrom ‘outside’, they focus on differences at home to help children reflect\nupon their own cultural identity. Children also researched the history of the\npeninsula and collectively designed a poster of art and industry of the local community\nincluding fruit picking and barges. They documented what their grand-\nparents did in the areas and in the school.\nProfile of foreign languages\nIn two of the schools, teachers and headteachers spoke earnestly and with deep\ncommitment about the importance of maintaining quality FL provision and\nreported that they welcomed statutory status as there is ‘now no choice’. All\nschools, however, reported that children were no longer excluded from FL and all\nteachers and headteachers spoke with resentment about the pressure to offer children\na pared down curriculum in order to focus on pupils’ attainment in Literacy\nand Numeracy in comparison with other schools.\nThey spoke about the challenges in terms of curriculum time, finding appropriately\ntrained staff – either specialist or generalist, and the dearth of professional\ndevelopment available. Supported by and driven by the leadership in the school,\nhowever, they found ways to maintain a focus on language, culture and diversity.\nThe headteacher in School A who had been a FL teacher prior to taking on a headship\nrole, argued that policy recognition in the national curriculum had given the\nsubject some sustainability and enabled staff to include it despite the challenges\nfacing their schools.:\nCultural threads in three primary schools 79\n', '…not particularly high profile in the school… this school’s under immense pressure\nfor results because whilst progress is great here attainment’s very low. … We’ve had\nthe regional school commissioner come to visit us because of low attainment. So\nreally it would be very easy to say we’re having a bread and water diet- Maths and\nEnglish morning to evening and that’s the way we’re going to raise standards in\nschool but the protection afforded by the statutory status I really do value that ….\nHeadteacher A\nShe continued that with 17 classes and only two staff who felt confident to teach\nSpanish, she had employed a specialist teacher. Provision had changed, she\nexplained, as the specialist was on maternity leave and the class teacher model of\nstaffing brought limitations but also benefits in terms of coherence to children’s\noverall learning and a sense of connection of FL and associated cultural learning\nto other curriculum subjects taught by the class teacher.\nI think the teachers found that more challenging this year because of the level of\npreparation that it involved. They’ve gone down the ‘keep it going, keep it fun’\napproach rather than the writing as much, so I’ve noticed less writing this year.\nThere’s also a Spanish club that runs at lunchtimes and they do performancesthings\nlike Little Red Riding Hood, quite simple little things and that’s where we are\nwith languages.\nShe went on to say that she had noticed benefits from the class teachers teaching\nSpanish:\nI would say the difference …is that they possibly see it …more like their other\nsubjects …Whereas previously when the specialist used to arrive in the classroom.\nAlthough the teacher was still there it was like a special event …it has normalised\nit for the children. …the teachers have been able to follow up with bits more, bits\nand pieces throughout the week. So, I’m still in two minds about having a specialist\ncome in to do it.\nCurriculum time limitations was discussed across all schools. A teacher in School\nB explained:\nThe curriculum is so intensely crowded. The morning is dedicated to Maths and\nEnglish. … other subjects take place …in the afternoon…, which also include\nassembly….\nThe headteacher in School C, was more reluctant to give curriculum time and\nprecious school resources to subjects other than Literacy and Numeracy. Despite\nthis however, FL was offered in all classes throughout the school and progress was\ntracked. Statutory status, therefore may have had some influence. He said:\n80 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'the main challenge ‘has got to be high stake testing. …if something’s tested the value\nincreases. …over the last 2 years the expectations for standards in grammar, punctuation,\nspelling and maths and writing has gone through the roof… So one of\nthe limiting factors …is the necessity to ensure the children achieve well in terms\nof the statutory tests …if you take a subject that’s quite often on the periphery,\nlike Primary Languages they’re the ones that probably get more lip service …as\nopposed to planned strategically …we track ..milestones every 2 years…we can see\nthat progress…in particular the residential trip where the children are really using\nand exploring those skills and qualities that we’re learning about. …Our key priorities\nthis year have been about getting the children, the disadvantaged children up\nto that level of oracy of literacy and it’s been a challenge. So there’s still that tug.\nShifts in government policy over the last decade had not helped develop the\npotential of primary languages as reported in government reports and other\nresearch studies. The headteacher in School C argued that:\nthere’s been a huge amount of flux, … huge confusion of expectations with languages.\nWe started with …Utilising online resources … by the county… allowing the\nresources to talk for those teachers who are a little anxious themselves about that\ndelivery. …. we (then) went through a little nonsense …where there was this great\ndrive for written language …\n(Now, in Year 1) we’ll do a little counting in French, when we’re doing the register,\nwe’ll answer the register in French responses so the children have that awareness\nof these words in ..normal conversation… ‘Levez vous and asseyez-vous’ instead\nof ‘stand up’ and ‘sit’ … KS2 we’re looking at a more structured approach to delivery.\nWe’ve kind of gently lost our way with Primary languages and (now) it’s\ncoming back.\nA prevailing sense of national culture\nA number of teachers spoke about the ‘poverty of experience and opportunities’\nof children on the estates and the importance for the school to provide a rich\ncultural offer. Within the language lessons themselves, teachers and headteachers\nspoke about how the foreign language ‘culture’ was shared, mainly through factual\ninformation, about food, landmarks, customs and behaviours, similar to evidence\nabout primary languages practice reported in other studies (Cable et al., 2014;\nDriscoll et al, 2014). These typical tourist examples of foreign cultures were\nenriched through intense weeks for cultural education, cross curricular cultural\nexperiences, where children were ‘immersed’ in the culture of one country and\nvisits and exchanges. All three schools explained that they try to profit from and\nCultural threads in three primary schools 81\n', 'use all the resources at their disposal to enrich the curriculum with examples of\ndiversity.\nThey are English, predominantly white, Anglo Saxon, working class, so actually\neverybody around them is nearly all the same … so when we do have some cultural\nTeacher School Bdiversity it’s interesting and fascinating…\nIn another school, the headteacher explained that recently a few families from\nother countries had moved into the area and teachers had invited them to read\nto children with storybooks in other languages and share food and customs with\nchildren. The headteacher explained that the school:\n‘do diversity days… where parents of children from Poland, Lithuania, Romania\ncome into the school’. … (Supported by the class teachers, the parents) ‘teach some\nof their words …. (and) Songs, …giving them the food, teaching them the games…\nHeadteacher Aand children are very open to this’.\nIn School ‘B’, children spend time researching political, social, geographical and\nhistorical facts and stories from the internet and school library about a country to\npresent to children in other classes. A teacher explained:\n… (children) go round the class and visit a country and learn some words.’\nConnecting cultural threads across the curriculum\nIn two schools, staff organised the curriculum in subject groups where cultural\nlearning was highlighted. One school taught humanity subjects together. The\nheadteacher explained:\nwe look at the links … quite often one puts humanities together. We look at the core\nqualities within those subjects … history uses reasoning skills, that probably matches\nthe reasoning skills that one would look at in science. So we’ve got an enquiry hub.\nOur cultural hub … we look at … …geographical understanding and other cultures,\n…and we felt that matched very well and with Primary languages because that has\nsuch a drive in terms of the cultural understanding. So, we group leaders…. review\nsubjects with those core principles in mind, to support one another, to assess one\nanother, to look at how we can develop the progression throughout the school. So it\ngives the subject leader some support in working with others in bouncing ideas off\nHeadteacher School Cother staff.\nIn another school, cultural development is monitored by the cultural team who\nare responsible for cultural learning in Art, Music, French, Design and Technology,\nReligious Education, History and Geography. The teams meet twice a term to\n82 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'plan. How teachers conceptualize ‘culture’ is critical and dependent on their own\nexperience and expertise. For example, one teacher explained, when connecting\nhistory and languages:\n(We did) World War One and the trenches and …some culture around France and\nBelgium.\nArguably, topics other than world wars are conducive to cultivating intercultural\nunderstanding. One teacher explained that when speaking about the French, a\nchild in her class said ‘they were with us in the war’. She went on to say:\nyou have to define culture for children’… ‘they all draw the same …castle, or\nLondon bus … they don’t all go further than the edge of the estate as some don’t\nhave access to cars.\nOne of the schools reported that they explore emotional as well as cultural issues\nthrough language learning. Recently, a teacher explained they have used a book\ncalled ‘The Colour Monster’ written by Anna Llenas in Spanish. There are different\ntypes of emotions represented. For the emotion of ‘anger’, the teacher read the\nbook in Spanish:\n… we talked about what would it would feel like if you were in another country and\nyou did not know the language. What could you use to work it out, would you use\nthe pictures/words you would recognise because they are similar to English? Then\nwe read the English version. But actually they could pretty much translate it from\nthe pictures….\nAt the time of the interview the school used three languages to speak about ‘anger’\nin different classes: French in Years 1 and 2; Italian for Years 3 and 4; and Spanish\nin Years 5 and 6.\nGlobal issues\nSchools combined intercultural and cultural awareness with raising awareness\nabout global issues. Hunt’s work (2012) about global learning in schools indicate\nthat global learning helped children to be more aware both socially and culturally\nand as such, broadened learners’ horizons. One headteacher explained how technology\nhelps to meet the aims of cultural and global learning.\nWe’ve joined up with a global learning partnership, one of the British Council outreach\nones… online resources but just generally the access on the internet now\nmeans if you want to know ‘what birthday celebrations in Guatemala are like’\nCultural threads in three primary schools 83\n', 'you can find something now that transports the children there and they’re able to\ndo that.\nTeachers spoke highly of all manner of technological devices to enhance cultural\nlearning, not only with specific commercial resources for teaching languages but\nalso from children’s own experiences. One headteacher explained that children\nare encouraged to make webcams of their travels, when visiting relatives or going\non holiday, thereby increasing children’s agency and enhancing the link between\nchildren’s experiences away from school and within school. Another headteacher\nspoke about the use of online resources and films and videos to bring alive cultural\ndiversity such as Christmas or Easter celebrations. One school had invested\nin Google Expeditions with virtual reality headsets. They explained:\nSo you could walk into a Chinese classroom, a rain forest …phenomenal! …We can’t\ntake the children there, we can be … immersive …using technology…\nGlobal citizenship and cultural or intercultural awareness is also evident in the\ninspection framework for schools. Ofsted, evaluate the quality and overall effectiveness\nof cultural development in schools, particularly those schools that are\nnot performing at the expected level in comparison with national average attainment\nscores.\nThe headteachers all agreed that opportunities for international, regional and\neven local visits had diminished because of limited funding and increased prices\nfor travel and accommodation thereby reducing children’s opportunities to experience\ndifference and widen their perspectives. The importance of technology was\ntherefore increasing. One teacher also thought that a sense of stranger-fear had\nincreased, causing more parents to be reluctant about their children travelling\nabroad or away from home without them. One school managed to maintain a\nFrench residential trip, despite these challenges. The headteacher explained:\nThe 3-day residential to France they experience a whole host of French culture and\na little bit of language too. But the language isn’t the focus. When they’re away we\nmake sure there’s a culturally rich activity week for the children who go and those\nthat don’t go on that trip.\nOne teacher explained that international work particularly with the Erasmus project\nhas had a major influence in the school. She said:\nthis Erasmus project … is about changing the whole school’s way of dealing with\nwhat could be a problem and twisting it on its head and turning it into an advantage\nso that we are now proud of having these children in our school and their\nfamilies and we see them as a resource to develop our whole school cultural awareness\nrather than “Oh dear, we have a Polish child who cannot speak English”, now\n84 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'we think differently “Oh good, we can learn some of the child’s home language”,\nwe can have displays and the teachers can have a cultural celebration … a real\nmind-set change.\nBritish values\nThe legal requirement that Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural (SMSC) development\nshould be subjected to official inspection and be part of the School Inspec-\ntion remit (Ofsted) has augmented the interest, status and importance of personal\ndevelopment and values and school’s effectiveness in delivering a quality education.\nIn relation to cultural development, pupils need to be able to demonstrate\nthat they: understand and appreciate cultural influences that have shaped their\nown heritage and those of others, show respect for, accept and understand diversity\nas shown by their tolerance and attitudes, and they are willing to participate in\nactivities as well as knowledge of the British parliamentary system (Ofsted, 2017).\nIn conversation with headteachers and teachers, ‘Britishness’ and British Values\nwere mentioned when speaking about cultural development. Education and\nthe curriculum have always been a cradle for notions of national identity but until\nnow, it has not been externally assessed against a four-point scale criteria of: ‘outstanding,\ngood, requires improvement or inadequate’. SMSC have also become\npart of teacher professionalism as they are included in the national Teachers Standards\n(DfE, 2012). Promoting British values, therefore, as determined by the gov-\nernment, influences how teachers frame culture and give boundaries to what is\nBritish and what is not – what is culturally acceptable and what is strange or foreign.\nOne teacher directed the conversation to display boards and posters around\nthe school to help children to identify the acceptable tenets of British values:\nWe have the new British values, we have the display boards around …If you ask\nsome children what British values are, they may not be able to reel them off per se\n… but the focus is on British as opposed to be European or just a citizen of\nTeacher School Bthe world…\nHeadteacher of School A explained:\nWe just gave over the week to looking at British Values as obviously it’s something\nthat came into the curriculum and we felt we had to get a handle on it quickly.\nSo we linked them to our school values and each class worked on the different values\nand created some sort of artistic or theatrical outcome …it wasn’t about writ-\ning …it was about their emotional engagement and how they felt they could show\nthat. So we had people doing hand prints for community, a quilt that you’ll see in\nCultural threads in three primary schools 85\n', 'the entrance that our older children made looking at all the different values. I did a\nseries of assemblies leading up to that with a different value in each assembly.\nHeadteacher in School C said:\n…you see so many schools that profess to do British values and when you look at\nwhat’s going on underneath the surface … (they) say we’ve got our values on display…\nAnd with regards to the role that primary languages can play in that it’s that\ncultural acceptance that we are part of a global community and that we can learn a\nlanguage and that it’s important that we can learn a language to demonstrate that\nwe’re not waiting for others to speak English that we’re trying to meet other cultures\npart way. I think culturally that’s very important that – in particular, which isn’t a\nvery diverse community, we have to work harder at that, because maybe some of\nthe children are of families that have a very insular view of diversity… It’s not that\nposter on the wall.\nConclusion\nThis paper explores foreign languages (FL) and associated intercultural development\nin diverse primary school settings in England. In all three schools, cultural\nlearning was holistic, cross curricular and embedded both through the values of\nthe school and through a more hard-line assessment regime for external stakeholders.\nTolerance and empathy threaded through much of the interviews with\nteachers and headteachers. The paper, however, argues that contradictions exist\nin the cultural offer provided: on the one hand teachers spoke of their deep commitment\nto broadening children’s horizons and developing threads through the\ncurriculum about the world and global issues to ensure that children look beyond\nthe local, regional and national. And on the other hand, some discussions reveal\nthat the essentialist national frame for foreign languages that reaffirms differences\nand the us-and-them narrative prevails. Teachers and headteachers are sensitive\nto local culture and work with children and their families to develop cultural\nlinks and threads between home and school thereby developing small cultures\non-the-go but ‘traditional’ grand narratives about teaching about food, folklore\nand festivals appear normal and unchallenged. Teachers, of course, do not work\nwithin a vacuum. Technology is helping to bring ‘real’ cultural experiences into\nthe classroom and teachers are keen to use new resources but funding and time\nare extremely limited. Teachers learn new strategies and approaches through initial\nand continuous development, but opportunities for development are also lim-\nited. Primary languages have the potential to lead the way and challenge the false\nessentialist assumptions that learners need or want of a country. Young learners’\nconstruction of culture is formed and influenced by their experiences at home,\n86 Patricia Driscoll & Adrian Holliday\n', 'at school – through the curriculum, and in the world outside. Their schools are\nproviding more topics that have meaning to their lives and their developing cultural\nidentity and it is time that foreign languages contributed more fully to the\ndiscourse.\nReferences\nAmadasi, S., & Holliday, A.
