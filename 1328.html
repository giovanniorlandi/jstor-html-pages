        <pre>['u\nVOLUME 5.\nROSWELL, NEW MEXICO, WEDNESDAY EVENING, JANUARY 29, 1908\nNUMBER 282\nat 4\nV\n-5\nC0RTELY0U\nEXPLAINS IT\nENDEAVORS TO DEFEND HIS\nCOURSE WITH BOND ISSUES\nAND BANK DEPOSITS.\nTHE BANKS ARE EAVORED\nNational Banks, the Secretary Says,\nWere Given Preference Over Other\nBidders for the Bonds. Used as a\nBasis for Additional \' Bank Note\nCirculation.\nWashington, Jan. 29. In response\nto the resolution agreed to by the sen\nate on Dec. 12, 1907, the Secretary of\nthe Treasury today transmitted to\nthat body detailed statements con\ncerning the" award of Panama bonds\nand three per cent certificates, to\ngether with recent financial transac\ntions of the government, and also em\nbodying information as to the general\nstate of the nation finances during\nthe closing months of 1907, the period\nover which the recent financial panic\nextended. The report, which is accom\npanied by a long letter from Secre\ntary Cortelyou, embraces a list of de\npositories and the amounts of money\nplaced on deposit on various dates; a\nlist of other banks with amount of\nbank note circulation and the securi\nty held therefor; statements showing\nthe condition of the banks August\n22 and December 31; the amount of\nbank notes outstanding at various\nperiod; list of banks and Individuals\nwho received Panama Canal bonds\nand lists of those -who hid for bonds\nwithout receiving allotments, and sub\nscriptions for three per cent certifi\ncates of indebtedness; data concern\ning clearing house certificates and\nother financial transactions which\ntook place during the period mention\ned in the senate resolution.\nThe Secretary defends the issue of\nPanama bonds and treasury certifi\ncates by saying it was advisable to\n.take some strong and resolute step\nwhich would convince the public,\nboth at home and abroad, that the\ngovernment was thoroughly alive to\nthe situation and determined to give\naid in every possible legal and proper\nform.\nConcerning the allotment of the\nnew Issue of securities, he said, their\ncharacter was such that it -was antic\nipated that most of the subscriptions\nwould come from national banks. At\ntwo per cent the bonds afforded such\nprivileges to national \'banks as a ba\nsis of note circulation that outside\ninvestors would find in the bonds\nnothing more than the best form of\nsecurities paying only two per cent.\nIt was expected, and this expectation\nwas fulfilled, that the bonds would\nbe Issued chiefly as a \'basis for adji\ntional bank note circulation. This, the\nSecretary thought, justified the res\ntriction exercised in the awards. For\nthe same reason he confined the is\nsue of three per .cent certificates as\nmuch as possible to national banks.\nSee J. L.

A clear and sun\nny day favored the royal procession\nto Westminster today where King Ed\nward opened parliament with the\nsame ceremonies observed for centu\nries. King Edward and Queen Alex\nandra rode from Buckingham palace\nto the houses of parliament in a gild\ned coach of state drawn by eight\nwhite horses. The soldiers who guard\ned the way had their hands full in\nkeeping the people back. The King\nread the speech from the throne\nwhile the Queen sat on the chair o\nstate at his right. The menace of an\noutbreak on the part of the woman\nsuffragists gave unusual interest to\nthe proceedings, and greater precau\ntions could not have been taken if\nan anarchist uprising had been fear\ned. Only the wives and relatives of\nmembers of parliament were admit\nted to the galleries.\nTake Notice.\nOur driver on the North Hill route,\nMr. Hill, had to leave unexpectedly\non account of death in his family.\nPlease \'phone us if we miss you and\nwe will get things straightened, out\nin a day or two.

At the\nsame time, it is, as you appreciate,\nabsolutely impossible not to have the\nreclamation work take a prominent\npart. If we did any less we would\nincur criticism for \'being lukewarm\nand unappreciative" of the subject.\nIn the same way, for the sixteenth\nirrigation congress, I trust that it\nwill he possible for us to help you\nin many details. In so doing, howev\ner, we do not wish the reclamation\nservice to be unduly prominent, or\nour men to be at all conspicuous. In\nother words, we desire to help you\nmake this not only a thoroughly en\njoyable but a beneficial meeting of\npractical men from all parts of the\ncountry.\nYou can command us within our\nability to second your efforts along\nthis line.

The principal\nspeaker before the committee was\nformer Governor Prince. He sketched\nthe efforts of New Mexico throughout\nthe last half century to gain state\nhood, and claimed that the territory\nhas at present a population of four\nhundred thousand, based on the last\nschool census.
