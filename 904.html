The\nnet result is an average profit to us of \' ■\nless than 1 ? a pound.\ni The choice cuts are higner because\nof a demand for them.\nAnother thing: Only 35 pounds of the !\nentire hog—or about 1/6 th—is usually\nmarketed at once. The rest must be ;\npickled, cured, or smoked. This takes\nmonths, and adds to the costs which\nmust be met.\nL Swift & Company, U.S. A.\nthis showvSs.\nNX AT WHAT BECOMES OE^v\n//Cp X/A\\ the AVERAGE DOLLAR Xy\n//<—T V*)\\\\ / RECEIVED BY \\\n/swift & _\nI I W 1 ■ /f FROM THE SALE Of MEAT 1\nj- j ANO BY PRODUCTS\n\\\\rt,yO* y /)C 4 IS I tl CENTS IS PAID FOR THC\nV\\ £,y nig \\\\ UVE ANIMAL H\nT B \\\\ 11,86 CENTS TOR LABOR ]\n\\\\ ** " IOJWCKMaiJer/B \\\\ expenses and phei6ht m\n\\\\Ojßr \\ 2,04 CENTS REMAINS Jf\n\\yC/j . o/y \\ with /\n\'VCO o o X SWIFT & COMPANY jf\nmoriT\nworks equipment and apparatus -\nWhereas, The City of Mineral Point,\nWisconsin, is a city of the 4th class,\norganized under the General Charter\nLaws of Wisconsin ; and\nWhereas, The total assessed valua\ntion of said city, at the time of the last\nassessment for state and county taxes,\nwas the sum of $3,538,245 00 ; and\nWhereas, The total indebtedness of\nthe city of Mineral Point at the present\ntime is less than $40,000.00, including\nall bonded indebtedness ; and\nWhereas, The city is without stand\nby pumping service, in event of power\nfailue by the public utility that is fur\nnishing the city with power for pump\ning city water at the present time ; and\nWhereas, It is necessary to issue\nbonds to cover the cost of the purchase\nof such additional pumping equipment,\nNow, Therefore, the Common Council\nof the City of Mineral Point do ordain\nas follows ;\nSection One.

Then the latter darted u"uy.\npursued by a little girl who, her apron\nfull of flowers, pelted her out of view\n\'villi the fragrant flowers.\nSomehow the mind of llruno wus set\nlit a turmoil. Had the lady in the\nfloral battle alined at her child op\nponent. or at himselfV At all events,\nthe episode set his mind In a whirl.\nHe had reached thirty the same Im\npressible Idealist that he had been at\ntwenty. He treasured Hie rose and\ndreamed dreams. He passed the same\nplace Slowly the next day. Half ob\nscured by some lilacs was a feminine\nform. Bruno slightly raised his hat.\nI\'muistakahly In response there was\nthe flutter of a handkerchief. He was\nnoticed. It must he the lad.\' of the\nrose battle! A vast ferment of senti\nment and romanticism took place In\nhis soul. The next morning it was\nraining, but from an upper window In\nthe house, a white hand moved as if in\nnotice or greeting.\nPassing down the street the next\nday with his close friend. Dale Arm\nstrong, Bruno clutched his arm fever\nishly and indicating u lady crossing\nfrom (he house now his center of at\ntraction to an automobile, and whose\nface was that of the lady of the\nroses, he uttered tumultuously:\n“Armstrong, you know everybody in\ntown. Who is that girl?”\n"Girl?" repeated Dale. She is a\nmarried woman Mrs. Walter Martin.\nHusband and child. What’s your in\nterest?"\n“Nothing,” he faltered In a sort of a\ncollapsing groan. "Love blasted! my\nideal vanished ! Only a flirt!" he told\nhimself in a suppressed undertone. It\nwas (lie rude blighting of a possible\nromance In Its budding that so crushed\nBruno. He hud woven a fairy fabric\nof ideality and it was humiliating, de\npressing, disappointing to have it thus\nsent asunder. Armstrong, coming in\nto his office the next day, found him\nseated, morose anfl hollow eyed at the\nwindow, staring out blankly at nothing\nness.\n“What’s the trouble, Bruno?” he hail\ned In his cheery oIT-liund way.\n“Oh, tired of life and its false prom\nises,” returned the other dismally. I\ndon’t siian to reuch any goal in my\nexperiences. Tell you, I’m almost sui\ncidal In my present mood."\n"That so?" rallied Armstrong bland\nly. “Well, over In my office I’ve got\na real glittering stiletto, a true and\nhonest, deadly revolver and a bottle\nof ‘sure thing’ cyanide. Want to make\na choice?”\n"Thank you. no," answered Bruno\nsourly, nettled at the badinage, good\nnatured as It was. “if I ever step off\nabruptly the water route Is the surest\nand cheapest."\nThere seemed (o be a satisfaction In\nnursing his dark ideas. Bruno did not\ncheat himself by trying to believe.that\nhe had bean Incurably captivated by\nthe Indy of the ro.-cs The verge of\nromance land had attracted him, but\nhe had only glimpsed Its coniines when\nfate had abruptly transformed It Into\na dreary desert.\n“Oh, for one true sympathetic soul!”\nhe pondered as dejectedly he made his\nway homeward.\nIt was warm and he took off his coat.\nHe was restless and Irritated and\nbegun pacing up and down. He got\ndl .ctly up to the edge of the em\nbankment overlooking the stream.\n“Ah, placid waters, not so cruel as\na harsh, disappointing world," he ut\ntered melodramatically.\n"No —no —surely x<>>i are not think\ning of —of —"\nBruno started. A slender, winsome\nwoman had seized his arm. He did\nnot know that It was she who had\nthrown the Bine spray In hlr path and\nhad followed him. She was fair of\nface and graceful of form, although\nas fur up In the twenties ns himself,\nhnt there was a gentle sympathy In\nher eyes that somehow won "ft him.\n"If you mean I was go ■ •> Jump\nin." he said, “no; I’d ought to\nthough,”\n"Think of your friends!”\n"I have none.
