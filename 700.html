Neither any other\nelements of totalitarianism could be found.\n\x01 2014 The Regents of the University of California. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights\nreserved.1. Introduction\nThe state of Yugoslavia was first established as a result of events at the end of WorldWar I, only to be dismembered during\nWorld War II; reestablished by Tito’s Communist Partisan movement during the same war and then to remain a communist/\nsocialist state until 1990/91, when it was finally dissolved (Dedijer et al., 1972; Ramet, 2006).\nThe integration, functioning and dissolution of Yugoslavia are issues producing very different scholarly assessment. For\nexample, whereas Wachtel and Bennett (2009, 13) pay great respect to the personality of Tito, attributing the survival of the\nstate “largely to [his] adeptness”, Meier (1999, 2) considers his style as something demonstrating “his experience working in\nthe Comintern”, which was, of course, known for blind organizational subjugation and ruthlessness. Such ambiguity is to be\nexpected, since the internal disputes about Yugoslavia, as well as the enduring disagreements about its demise, are many. At\nthis point we shall limit ourselves to the opinion expressed by Jovi\x03c (2009), who considers “the Serbian question” to be the\ndominant one during this state, in contrast to the first Yugoslavia, when it was “the Croatian question”. These questions reflect\nsome of the basic tensions, disturbances and imbalances, which are beyond the scope of the current paper.1\nThe main aim of the current study is limited to the assessment of Yugoslavia’s political regime. Specifically, the current\nstudy taps into the issue of whether “second,” that is, post-World War II Yugoslavia was a totalitarian state. Namely, in the\nlands of the former Yugoslavia the use of the term “totalitarian” is frequent in public speech, but interestingly, only in two\ncases has official denotation been made by competent authorities in identifying the nature of government in the period\n1945e1990. The first can be traced to 2006, when the Croatian Parliament adopted a declaration on “the condemnation of\ncrimes committed during the totalitarian communist system in Croatia, 1945e1990” (Narodne Novine, 2006).2 The secondr example, Klanj\x02sek and Flere (2011).\nd by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe of 1996 on the same issue, where totaliism”,\na quality which certainly does not pertain to Yugoslavia (Parliamentary Assembly: Resolution,\nf California. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n', 'S. Flere, R. Klanj\x02sek / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 47 (2014) 237e245238occurs in the 2011 ruling of the Constitutional Court of Slovenia. It annulled a decision by the Ljubljana Municipality, which\nwanted to name a road under construction after the Josip Broz Tito. In the judgment, the Court mentioned “Tito’s symbolic\nmeaning” associated with “the post-war totalitarian communist regime”, and affirmed that “Tito symbolizes the totalitarian\nregime” (Ustavno Sodi\x02s\x02ce RS: UeI-109/10, 2011). In addition, the Slovenian Court also designated the entire period “totalitarian”,\nwith no substantive or temporal reservations.\nIn sum, the intention of the current paper is not to assess the political order of Yugoslavia in the period 1945e1990 in\nentirety, even less to justify it. The sole aim is to provide insight into whether the designation “totalitarian” is appropriate for\nYugoslavia as ruled by Tito and the order set up under him in this period. To do this, the concept of totalitarianism should first\nbe clearly explained.\n2. Totalitarianism\nIn political science the notion of totalitarianism is said to have been introduced by Friedrich and Brzezinski (1956) in\ntheir famous book Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy. The authors point out the following elements characteristic of\ntotalitarian regime: an official ideology considered “chiliastic”; a hierarchically organized mass party led by a dictator; a\nterrorist police force; a monopoly on armed combat forces; a monopoly on mass media; and central control of the\neconomy by state planning (1956, 9e10). Many authors find this definition to be the most authoritative (Heywood, 2007,\n73e74; Apter, 1996; Holmes, 2001), although there are other definitions that were constructed with a particular view to\nthe long existence of Soviet-type Communism, with the goal of accounting for the changes and variations that existed in\nvarious non-democratic systems across the globe. An important one was built by Kassof (1964), who, when speaking\nabout totalitarianism, writes of an “administered society”, “characterized by a growing size and importance of an elite\nparty and state bureaucracy” (1964, 599) that “operates by and large without resorting to those elements of gross irrationality\n(in particular the large scale and often self-defeating use of psychological terror and physical coercion)” (Kassof,\n1964, 559).\nAlthough the former is in line with Friderich and Brzezinski’s definition (the idea of a single state and apparatus vs. the\nmass), the latter introduces an important element which bifurcates the concept of totalitarianism. In essence, Kassof\n(1964, 561) introduces a distinction between “irrational” and “rational” totalitarianism. This can also be discerned\nwhen he notes that, although the pressure may have diminished as “substantial liberalization has taken place” (under\nKrushchev), this is seen only as “a tactical regrouping on the march from a relatively primitive to a far more advanced\nvariety of twentieth-century totalitarianism” (Kassof, 1964, 575). In other words, in his effort to account for a change in\nthe system, Kassof introduces the distinction between “primitive” and “advanced” totalitarianism, where the difference\nshould be understood in the context of the functionalization and streamlining of totalitarianism, where counterproductive\nelements are eliminated only to make the machine more operational and efficient, in comparison to the immediate postrevolution\n“irrationalities”.\nThis argument is interesting in relation to a point made by Friedrich and Brzezinski (1956) and others (Kirkpatrick,\n1979), who consider communist systems as phenomena impervious to reform. Specifically, they argue that totalitarian\nsystems cannot be transformed into more rationalized ones, even less into democratic or liberal ones; they can only\nbecome increasingly “total” (Friedrich and Brzezinski, 1956, 293e303). However, Kassof’s writing does imply that this\nchange is possible, but that this process of “substantial liberalization” should be understood only in the context of making\nthe system more totalitarian.\nWe would argue that such conceptualization produces numerous difficulties, the main one being the de-solidification\nof the concept of totalitarianism, which renders the term difficult to use. Although such endeavors are common in the\nsocial sciences, they often instigate discussion that adds little value to the explanation of particular social phenomena\n(since they revolve around the issue of “who meant what”). In addition, if we take, for example, Kassof’s rationale and\napply it to the concept of democracy, we might end by arguing that the potential change that limits the civic liberties\nshould be understood as something that strengthens democratic rule (since liberalization would need to be understood e\nidiosyncratically - as something that strengthens totalitarianism). Bearing this in mind, the current study will try to avoid\nsuch issues by focusing on a more straightforward definition of totalitarianism: the one introduced by Friedrich and\nBrzezinski (1956).\n3. Yugoslavia e a totalitarian state?\nThere can be no doubt that the triumphant Yugoslav communists in 1945 had effectively begun to introduce in Yugoslavia\na system with key totalitarian features. Such an intent pursues from the following: (1) doing away with the multi-party\nsystem and particularly with political opposition (Ko\x02stunica and \x02Cavo\x02ski, 1983), and the establishment of the rule of a\nvanguard party; (2) mass extra-judicial executions immediately after the war (although this was not unique to Yugoslavia but\nsignificantly surpassed the incidence in France, for example (Judt, 2007), becoming even a kind of mass intimidation), as the\nfirst step in the introduction of a potent political police; (3) organizing the economy by doing away with private ownership in\nagriculture with catastrophic consequences (Borak, 2002); (4) control of mass media (Ko\x02stunica and \x02Cavo\x02ski, 1983); (5) the\nestablishment of armed forces subordinate to the Party; and (6) an official communist ideology seen as redemptive or\n“chiliastic”, which had a monopoly position in public life (Jan\x02car, 1998; Cvetkovi\x03c, 2011; Rodi\x03c, 1995).\n', 'S. Flere, R. Klanj\x02sek / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 47 (2014) 237e245 239Nevertheless, the crucial question is whether the political order in Yugoslavia was totalitarian in its entirety and\nthroughout its existence (1945e1990)?\n3.1. Political order and political police\nDefining the nature of a political order is always a tricky issue, since one cannot judge only by external factors, that is, by\nformal definitions of institutions. Thus, institutions may conceal the true power relations and political instruments. In\npolitical science, institutions are often the point of departure for analysis. This is clearly indicated in International Encyclopedia,\nwhere the following is stated: “Without institutions there could be no organized politics. In the absence of in-\nstitutions there would be no organization at all . [it would be] a Hobbesian hell” (Steinmo, 2001, in Smelser and Baltes,\n2005, 7554e7555). Thus, institutions, in the elementary sense, with rules of established organizations, are a prerequisite for\nall politics.\n3.1.1. Political order\nThe institutional representation of nationalities and republics in the federal government can basically be observed for the\nentire extent of Yugoslavia’s existence after World War II. Even AVNOJ3 in 1943 declared that Yugoslavia would be a federal\nstate. The six republics were enumerated in its declaration at that session in the Bosnian woods, in the midst of warfare (two\nautonomous units were added in 1946, partly supplementing the picture). Furthermore, this representation of nationalities\nand republics would later become an official principle (Constitution of SFRY, 1963).\nThis multi-national reality, with differently perceived economic interests, soon produced conflicts that lasted until the\ndissolution. As early as 1962, at a session of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia Executive, Tito commented on the discourse\n(promoting the interests of individual republics) at sessions of the federal government, where economic measures were\nadopted and the boycott of a federal parliamentary session was staged by representatives of one republic (Slovenia). On this\noccasion, Tito said: “What kind of discussions are these! One can ask whether this state is able to survive, without dissolving”\n(Ze\x02cevi\x03c, 1998: 32).\nThis sheds some light upon both the integration of Yugoslavia at the time and the relations within the ruling elite, where\nevidently “each pulled in favor of his own republic”, although not before the public. To put it differently, Tito’s words cannot\nbe considered those of a totalitarian dictator, inspired by an ideologically “chiliastic” mission, but the words of a concerned\npolitical leader. Consequently, such relations within the political elite are not the relations depicted by Friedrich and\nBrzezinski (1956, 19e20), who wrote of passive, “henchman” like, implementers of the dictator’s orders. Moreover, we\nare speaking of 1962, a full decade before the definitive institutional arrangement of Tito’s Yugoslavia and the 1974\nConstitution, with which the country would await the founder’s death. Thus, even in 1962, a crisis of “total control” is\ndiscernible, one that will not go away until the dissolution, even though the citizens might not have been aware of it.\nNext, although the 1963 Constitution did not strengthen the republics (this was done later),4 some sort of strengthening\ndid come about during attempts at economic reform in the 60s, where the republics became autonomous subjects, and\nacquired a deeper sense of their interests and of pursuing them, still within a redistributive economy. Officially, the nature of\nthe federation was changed by Constitutional amendments of 1971, where the federation was styled more as a voluntary\nassociation, a union of states, reaching decisions on all issues by way of “agreement” (although this was not majoritarian\ndecision-making). The federal head of state became a collective one, whereas Tito’s position and competences remained\nintact, and the cult of his personality was inflated. This pleased the “oldman”, masking the true nature of affairs and preparing\nfor his natural demise (Simi\x03c, 2006; Matunovi\x03c, 1997).\nInside the League of Communists, as well as within state bodies, there was a complex composition, with features of\npolyarchy5 in the sense of legitimate defense of one’s interests, making this the substance of the political process (Bertsch,\n1977; Burg, 1984). This complexity of decision-making can be demonstrated by the mode of composing political bodies at\nthe federal level. The “totalitarian dictator” did not appoint themembers of federal and republics bodies; instead, it was a long\nprocess of achieving “agreement”, harmonization, and manipulation. In his candid testimony, at the beginning of the 70s, S.\nDoronjski speaks of months-long “consultations” to appoint federal functionaries from Vojvodina, where members of the\nprovince, republic and federal elite took part, as well as Tito (Kon\x02car and Boarov, 2011).6\nWe stop short of advancing the idea that it was a full-fledged polyarchy; however, a situation of complex decision-making\nwith a multiplicity of actors could definitely be observed. In other words, there was no blind, unconditional and unquestioning\nfollowing of the leader by the basic actors (republics and provinces). Strong defense of particularistic interests took\nplace in a masked, Aesopian manner. True, there was no political opposition in the classic sense (Ionescu and Madariaga,\n1968), but the republics often opposed each other and “coalesced”, all this masked by an ideological unity newspeak.3 AVNOJ (Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia) was a Communist-sponsored and staged ’parliament’ of Yugoslavia, which held its\nsecond session in 1943 in Jajce, Bosnia.\n4 The most notable change came in the 1974 Constitution, where republics were defined as “states” and equipped with individual ministries for foreign\nand defense affairs.\n5 “Every member of the organization performs the acts we assume to constitute an expression of preference among the scheduled alternatives” (Dahl,\n1972, 84).\n6 However, Doronjski does not mention that the entire elite was awaiting the leader’s death (Kon\x02car and Boarov, 2011).\n', 'S. Flere, R. Klanj\x02sek / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 47 (2014) 237e245240Furthermore, Jovi\x03c (2009, 207) writes that the “principle of consent”7, in official use as of 1971, meant that a minority of\nrepublics and provinces could veto any decision.8\nIn sum, these arrangements do not fall neatly within the concept of Friedrich and Brzezinski (1956, 48), who assert that in\ntotalitarian systems constitutions have primarily “propaganda value”. In order to avert open conflict between republics (and\nprovinces), a peculiar type of decentralization came about, optimistically seen by its framers as cooperative federalism.\nHowever, this federalist decision making was dependent on the consent of each republic and province, making the process of\nagreement achievement ever more difficult and distant in a situation where the economy was not producing any surpluses\nandwhere the leading republics and provinces were aware of the distribution process. The distributive nature of the economy\nhad conflict built in - particularly in the case of foreign assistance, the value of currency, credit and fiscal policy. This was a\npluralistic manner of decisionmaking, with entities bitterly fighting for their perceived interests and shares in the distributive\neconomy. The decision-making was to be harmonized by the single Party, but it did not operate as such. This was unity in\nappearance only, as each republican-province leadership was guided only to enhance its particular interests. This was\ninstitutionally completed by all of the republics having their own national banks, ministries of foreign affairs and Territorial\nArmy units under republican command (to be harmonized at the federal level).\n3.1.2. Political police\nFor the operation of a totalitarian system, having a political police force is of crucial importance. As Friedrich and Brzezinski\n(1956, 115) write, the activity and purges within the secret police could only reinforce and reassert the central power.\nAt the end of World War II, People’s Defense Corps of Yugoslavia (Korpus narodne obrambe Jugoslavije or KNOJ) and The\nDepartment of National Security (Odjeljenje za za\x02stitu naroda or OZNA) were established in Yugoslavia, soon to be replaced by\nState Security Service or UDBA. They carried out tasks typical of political police in a totalitarian system (Jan\x02car, 1998;\nCvetkovi\x03c, 2011). As indicated by Ramet (2006), this was especially true for the “first phase” (1945e1953), when oppositionists\nwere locked up or even eliminated when a severe suppression of the independent press occurred, and when harsh\nmeasures were put in place to force through a program of agricultural collectivization. Nevertheless, a clear turnabout came\nlater. In 1966, with the fall of A. Rankovi\x03c, the undisputed head of the Yugoslavian political police, owing to alleged abuses, the\nreorganization was not limited to technical features. Specifically, the reorganization made it impossible for a political police\nforce to operate by mechanisms typical of totalitarian systems.\nThe substance of the changes from 1966 onward was to establish six separate republic secret police forces, supplemented\nby a 7th, the federal one, which was to organize cooperation.9 For the first time, these issues were then legally, statutorily\ngoverned at the republican level. For example, in Slovenia, in 1967, the Act on Internal Affairs was adopted, without invoking\nany previous republican or federal regulations. It also governed state security, including the implementation of federal statutes\nby the republican police. According to this law, the organization of internal affairs began and ended at the republican level,\nwith nomention of cooperationwith other republics, or with federal authorities. It shifted responsibility toward the republics’\nassemblies. This does not mean that parliamentary control was efficacious, but it does indicate that the organizational\nframework lay at the republican level. This arrangement went for the other republics as well and for the provinces after 1971.\nIt may also bementioned that in 1966e1967, the network of spyingwas radically diminished, as well as the number of files\nmaintained on individuals. In Slovenia, the volume of files decreased, for example, from 270,000e1000 m in length and\nallegedly retained only those files indicating “enemy activity” (Cvetkovi\x03c, 2011, 115). Criminal procedure came within the\nbounds of due process, although further limitation on police powers was wished by Fisk (1971, 291, 297).\nThis does not mean that there were no further offences against international human rights standards; nevertheless, it was\na newand different situation, since the political policewas restrained, if in no other way, by fragmentation10, and therewas no\nleader of the secret policewho could become as unquestioned and notorious as Rankovi\x03c. Furthermore, the conditions did not\nexist for the seven services to cooperate by harmonization.117 Jovi\x03c (2009, 104), describing the situation in the 70s, writes: “Serbian leaders were surprisingly negative toward Tito’s pragmatic politics, adhering to\nprinciples as they understood them . they were not soft negotiators” . they had been very firm in not accepting Kosovo as the seventh republic”.\n8 The mode of opposition and coalescing became evident to the public only after a new balance was attained in the federal presidency, when Milo\x02sovi\x03c,\nby amending the Serbian constitution, appointed members of the federal presidency representing the 2 provinces by the Serbian parliament (instead of by\nthe provincial parliaments). This amounted to a constitutional coup d’état. The transcripts of the sessions of the presidency from the first quarter of 1991\nmake the opposition and coalescing clear and manifest (Nikoli\x03c and Petrovi\x03c, 2011), whereas previous ones were not made open, although they certainly\ndid exist regarding day to day economic decision making.\n9 To further maintain his access to security information, Tito resorted to the military and its intelligence service (KOS), which seems to have strengthened\n(Matunovi\x03c, 1997).\n10 This fragmentation could be observed in the context of UDBA killings of Croatian nationalists abroad. These were carried out by the Croatian republic\nUDBA (instance Ðurekovi\x03c, where Perkovi\x03c is prosecuted at the beginning of 2014), indicating independence of republic UDBAs, bringing about their infighting\nand interference in other entities, something not typical of totalitarianism. Possibly, all this is more typical of decay of the system than of its\noperational functionality. Thus, we were not dealing with a single secret police structure, typical of totalitarianism, but with a plurality, amongst which\ncompetition and in-fighting were common.\n11 The lack of cooperation and coordination may be discerned in the last bold “active measure” by UDBA, a bombing in Austria (1982) that was carried out\nby the Slovenian UDBA and no federal instructions or control were mentioned (Kav\x02ci\x02c, 1988, 476e477), even though Austrian authorities supposed to the\ncontrary (Mekina, 2011). Ivan Cvitkovi\x03c, former secretary of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina remembers the Bosnian leadership in the\n80s to have officially protested against the Serbian secret service (UDBA) carrying out and circulating an “analysis” on interethnic relations in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, that is, operating outside its area of jurisdiction (personal communication).\n', 'S. Flere, R. Klanj\x02sek / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 47 (2014) 237e245 241All this is in complete contradiction of Friedrich and Brzezinski’s description of the political police and its varieties within\ntotalitarianism.12\n3.2. The economy\nAs the nature of the economywas also not the same for the entire period 1945e1990 (Horvat, 1976), the comprehension of\nthe essence of the economy in Tito’s Yugoslavia is again quite complex, especially with respect to who managed economic\nentities, who was their formal leader and who the substantive master. One cannot believe the official doctrine on workers’\nself-management,13 although it did contain more than a grain of truth regarding the substance of management (\x02Zupanov,\n1977). As indicated by Vetta (2009), the whole system, although “it did not derive from a grassroots initiative but was\nmore a revolution from above” (80), could be seen as a step toward participatory democracy, as “it was the means to shift the\nlocus of bargaining over wages and jobs to the level of the firm or lower” (Woodward, 1995, 329).\nNot surprisingly, efforts to implement the idea that came close to “market socialism” (Klanj\x02sek, 2013) spawned great\ninterest among various scholars. The large number of Western economists studying the Yugoslav economy was impressive,\nas well as the number of their publications, even as early as the 60s (Chowdhury et al., 1990; Dirlam and Plummer, 1972;\nEstrin et al., 1988; Gregory and Stuart, 1985; Marschak, 1968; Milenkovitch, 1971; Tyson, 1977; Ward, 1968; Wechtel,\n1972.). Although none was able to discern a clear model and none affirmed the economy to be effective, the autonomy\nof the economic entities was indicated by Rusinow (1967, 21) who wrote that, regarding the economy, the Yugoslav state\n“could not reasonably be called a totalitarian one”. In addition, such exposure, that is, to be studied by independent foreign\ninvestigators, is in itself contrary to the nature of the totalitarian economy. As noted by Friedrich and Brzezinski (1956,\n198), in a totalitarian state, economic statistical data are always incomparable, doctored, and available only to the top\nofficials.\nIn Yugoslavia, economic entities (enterprises) were structured, had autonomous competences and even in the 60s did not\noperate in the manner typical of totalitarian economies (on the basis of orders from a central bureaucratic instruction as to\nproduction and exchange, without influence from themoney economy). There were no “quotas” imposed upon enterprises in\norder to exchange them for other commodities by way of planned economic transactions (Friedrich and Brzezinski, 1956,\n203). Truly, as of the 1960s, there were no attempts to impose a planned economy. True state economic control was also\nlacking, bringing about an unexpected recession in 1961e1962, despite the “directives” of the 1961e1965 “plan” and of the\ncurrent economic policy (Borak, 2002, 59). This plan was abandoned, and all further ones were “indicative” in nature (Borak,\n2002, 49). They also happened to be “’late” in adoption (Borak, 2002, 53), and even “based on social compacts” inter-republic/\nprovince agreements (Borak, 2002, 58). In the absence of state control, othermechanisms operated in governing the economy,\nincluding market, and welfare (\x02Zupanov, 1977).\nIn the Yugoslav economy, both federal and republican authorities had competences, particularly over investments.\nHowever, the General Investment Fund, a non-market institution of distribution, was abolished in 1963, and financing of\nunderdeveloped areas remained under federal competence. With reference to a late moment in the history of Yugoslavia, the\nBritish economist Flakierski (1989) even opined that, at the beginning of the 1980s, the economic functions of the federation\nwere too minor for a sound economy.14 In other words, although the economic system lacked efficacy (Borak, 2002), its\ncomplexity and differentiationwere features alien to totalitarianism to a large extent, since totalitarian power is by definition\nconcentrated in one location, at the central level.\n3.3. Culture and religion\nThe concept of a totalitarian state as indicated by Friedrich and Brzezinski (1956) presupposes that the entirety of cultural\nlife, education and particularly the media are subjugated to an official “chiliastic” ideal of a future society that would also\nallow for all political and repressive instruments to be applied.\nIn Yugoslavia, there certainly was such an idea. On the one hand, there was the idea of communism that was\nincreasingly supplemented by “socialist self-management”, and on the other, there was an idea of “non-alignment”.15\nHowever, at issue is whether these ideas were as monolithic and strong as to permeate all of the education and culture\nthroughout the period.\nFriedrich and Brzezinski (1956, 77) assert that in the Soviet Union the proletariat replaced the position held by the nation\nin democratic societies. Although Tito never ceased to speak of “brotherhood and unity” among nationalities, one can discern12 On the state of cooperation and harmony among republics, it is indicative that their elites’ favorite topics of discourse were as follows: computing the\nrepresentation of their own cadres in the federal vs. other units and studying the economy from the point of view of ’exploitation’ of their own republics\n(Zukin, 1987).\n13 Self-management, envisioned by Milovan Djilas, Edvard Kardelj and Boris Kidri\x02c, could be seen as a system that tried to be something in between\ncentralized socialist planning and the market economy. It rested on the enterprise as its fundamental unit in which workers, had (at least formally) the right\nto deliberate and vote on basically all important issues, including business plans, wages, and others (Horvat, 1976; Kardelj, 1980).\n14 Intentionally, we do not invoke authors publishing in the former Yugoslavia.\n15 The “Non-Aligned Movement” was founded in Belgrade in 1961 and included a group of states that considered themselves not aligned formally with or\nagainst any major power bloc.\n', 'S. Flere, R. Klanj\x02sek / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 47 (2014) 237e245242in the official ideological texts that proletariat had not replaced nationality. Reading official ideological texts, one can find that\n“alleged internationalism” is in fact a “counterfeit vanguardism” (Resolution of the Eighth Congress of the LCY), or that inside\nYugoslavia “respect for nationalities sovereignty and parity” is “a fundamental condition” . “for cooperation among republics”16\n(Ninth Congress of the LCY), which we can also read as recognition of the lack of such cooperation. Here, it should\nbe stressed that the point of departure was the absence of Yugoslav essentialism, and of originality in the federal state, which\nwould necessarily be present in a totalitarian version of ideology (Jovi\x03c, 2009).\nTruly, it cannot be denied that an ideological monopoly existed and that differences and deviating opinions were often\nexpressed in an Aesopian way, without express renunciation of the “Marxist truth”. However, cultural life in the country,\nespecially after the 60s, exhibited great variety and pluralism. In Slovenian theatres, vanguard Western dramatists, such as\nIonesco, Miller, Camus, Osborne and Albee, were staged on a regular basis (Poni\x02z, 2007), while in Belgrade a theatre (Atelje\n212) operated that was devoted to vanguard trends. Books containing concepts alien to Communism were published,\nincluding those by Camus, Sartre, Schumpeter and even Marcuse (1968), who denied the role alleged by the working class,\naccording to communist dogma.\nIn the case of the press, content analysis would reveal whether a media monopoly existed, but such an analysis would\nbe very demanding, particularly considering the Aesopian manner of expressing republic-province distinctions in manifesting\nidentity, interest and animosity, all of which pretended to be in line with Marxist doctrine phraseology. Thus, we\nwill deal with the matter from a somewhat more indicative point of view - from the perspective of religious communities/\nfreedom. Namely, for the determination of totalitarianism, the attitude toward religious communities is of utmost relevance,\nsince totalitarian ideology excludes all other views containing absolute values as well as the organizations which\npursue from such views. Although Yugoslavia was not a model of respecting human rights, the question is whether it was\ntotalitarian.\nVarious sources (Roter, 1976; Alexander, 2008) indicate that although the repression was truly acute until the 1950s,\nduring which major groups lost most of their properties, a vigorous range of religious activities still took place. True, the\nregime suppressed all activities outside the spiritual, particularly any church/religious group intervention with public,\nlet alone political nature, causing dissatisfaction among the main religious group clergy. Interestingly, Alexander (2008), one\nof the most knowledgeable students of the issue, does not critique this position and behavior by the regime, since “religion\nand nationalism were profoundly identified. each of these concepts had been affected and in their most extreme forms\ndistorted by the other.” “the communists were determined to change this by enforcing a fundamental separation of church\nand state” (1979/2008, 121). She uses no harsh words for the regime, although she does note that the activities of religious\ngroups were limited.\nThe Yugoslav federal, republic and provincial legislation from the 70s allowed registration of religious communities\nwithout substantive limitations. The number of religious communities grew, which is something that is contrary to totalitarianism.\nWith respect to the religious press, which was the medium of greatest relevance at the time, it is possible to\ndocument 65 newspapers with a total of 3,591,000 copies being printed in 1966 (Statisti\x02cki bilten, 1967), while in 1987\n“religious societies, churches and associations” issued a total of 99 newspapers, with a circulation of over 3,700,000 copies\n(Statisti\x02cki bilten,1988). This does not necessarilymean that all religious press could be found at state retail press vendors, but\npostal circulation was not known to have been disrupted.\nThis indicates that not only could a variety of religious press be found (as would be expected in a multi-confessional\ncountry), but that even the citizenry had considerable choice in the middle of the communist period, well before the signs\nof the breakdown became visible. The activity of religious entities in themedia arena is thus quite at odds with what Friedrich\nand Brzezinski (1956, 107) write on the issue, since Yugoslavian proponents of the most communism-incompatible worldview\nhad significant opportunities for media activity, and made abundant use of them. Of course, it is again important to note\nthat this was not the case for the entire period of Tito’s rule.17\nIn sum, it seems inapt to speak of an ideologically monolithic media and cultural block, as would be typical of totalitarianism.\nThe content of the press may have been limited on politically sensitive issues, but choice was available to the\nreadership with variety, in full contrast to the Soviet Union, where, for example, until 1990 only the Journal of the Moscow\nOrthodox Patriarchate was available.\n3.4. Armed forces\nDuring World War II, the Communist partisans founded the Yugoslav People’s Army (Dedijer et al., 1972) as part of the\nCommunist anti-fascist armed effort and in the presence of a civil war and a commitment to assume power. At the end, it\ndeveloped into a totalitarian model. However, in 1968, and even earlier, republican armed forces began to be established\nin the form of “territorial defense” (Bubanj, 1972). Thus, the republics were not without their own institutionalized\narmed forces. This is again an indication of a model that contradicts what is advanced by Friedrich and Brzezinski (1956,\n9e10).16 Calling upon cooperation between republics indicates a permanent crisis in their relations.\n17 Nevertheless, one should not think Tito’s regime allowed this out of pure favoring of worldview pluralism. On the one hand, the major religious groups\naccessed media outlets only with great effort (mainly before 1960); on the other hand, Protestant groups, in particular, availed themselves of the use of the\npress. The communist regime hoped that pluralism would weaken the major traditional religious groups (Rodi\x03c, 1995).\n', 'S. Flere, R. Klanj\x02sek / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 47 (2014) 237e245 2433.5. Other features\nOther features mentioned in scholarship regarding totalitarianism may be relevant in assessing the nature of the state.\nSuch is the issue of “purges”. Allegedly, it would have sufficed for the dictator to give the nod for the leaders in question to find\nthemselves dismissed (Friedrich and Brzezinski, 1956, 155). Today, we know that the Yugoslav system did not operate in this\nway, that many dismissals and depositions of leaders after the 60s were not a product of Tito’s caprice. For example, the\nSlovenian political leadership successfully defended Edvard Kardelj, who remained his “closest associate”’ and the “architect\nof constitutionality”. In 1962, Tito intended, in the midst of economic crisis, to dismiss Kardelj, but was unsuccessful\n(Matunovi\x03c, 1997, 272; Pirjevec, 2011, 460).\nNext, Tito’s removal of the Croatian leadership in 1971 followed unrest among Croatian youth, when the leadership lost\ncontrol over events, and not because the leadership unleashed heated discussions on inter-republic and interethnic issues18\n(Tripalo, 1990, 121e79).\nThe Serbian leadershipwas removed in 1972 but only after long disputes between the leadership and Tito, lasting for years.\nThe Serbian leadership was not prepared to remove eight teachers from Belgrade University and opposed Tito on numerous\nissues, particularly on the issue of the former being too “soft on democracy” (Simi\x03c, 2006, 297e337; Nikezi\x03c, 2003).\nAssociated with the examples above is the assertion by Arendt (1961) that totalitarianism serves to fragment and atomize\nsociety, creating and maintaining a depersonalized mass but not creating “structures”. Arato (2002, 486) expresses the same\nthought in stating that totalitarian systems destroy institutions, while authoritarian ones rely on them. Arendt (1961, 305e\n479) contrasts Lenin, who worked to establish nationalities, and Stalin, who “atomized”.\nIn sum, Tito’s rule, although not an example of civil society development, did stimulate the development of republics\nand provinces, institutions and quasi-institutions, the abundance of which eventually assumed a somewhat grotesque\nappearance e degrees of organizations of “associated labor”, “self-management communities of interest” with their assemblies\nand chambers.4. Conclusion\nThe current paper has tried to address the issue of whether Yugoslavia was a totalitarian state. Since it is often a matter of\ndispute what the terms “totalitarianism” or “totalitarian regime” mean and represent, the concept used in the study was the\none advanced in the classical study by Friedrich and Brzezinski (1956) as it seemed most operationalizable, that is, it most\nclearly expressed the dimensionality and character of said regime. Given a concept such as “a measure of totalitarianism”, the\nexamples and findings offered in the study indicated that qualifications expressed by the Slovenian Constitutional Court and\nthe Croatian Parliament cannot be corroborated for the entire period of the existence of Tito’s Yugoslavia: namely, the regime’s\nbeing totalitarian without qualification, in substance and time.\nThe current paper indicates that as of the middle of the 60s, the republics were largely autonomous players and catered for\ntheir own interests, economic enterprises did not operatewithin a state command economy andmillions of copies of religious\nnewspapers were published. What is more, although Tito’s cult was promoted, his power was limited by the federal nature of\nthe state. Of course, this does not mean that repressionwas nonexistent, that there were no elements of a totalitarian regime.\nThis was especially true for the 1945-53 period. Repression was directed toward religious institutions, the immanent opponents\nof communism, toward political dissidents and toward a general control of the intelligentsia. Nevertheless, some of\nthis should be seen in light of the fact that religious entities, for example, were themselves acting to split up Yugoslavia (the\nCatholic and the Orthodox Church were in a state of open excommunicatory conflict until the Second Vatican Council) and\nthat some of this repression could be nominated totalitarian mainly by exterior manifestations.19\nNow, if Yugoslavia wasn’t totalitarian for more than half the period in question, what type of political systemwas it? Since\nit did not claim to be continuing some revered tradition in invoking legitimacy, it is difficult to argue that the system was\nauthoritarian. The complex nature of Yugoslavia is indicated by Linz and Stepan (1996: 366), who said, “. theorists put\nYugoslavia in a different category from all other Communist systems, because they believed that worker self-management\nwas a form of democracy .”. Interestingly, Linz and Stepan (1966) also omitted to consider Yugoslavia, that is, the postYugoslav\nstates, in a special chapter describing democratic transition, as they did for many other transition cases. We\nwould argue that this was certainly not because the topic lacked interest, but because it was a complicated and muddled\nmatter. Even Friedrich and Brzezinski (1956, 48) were silent on Yugoslavia, mentioning it only once marginally, relative to\nrelations with Bulgaria in the immediate post-World War II period.\nNumerous other political scientists were also aware of the peculiarity of Yugoslavia. Besides those already mentioned,\nIonescu andMadariaga (1968) considered that Yugoslavia could not be classified into either of the prevalent systems in Europe\nat the time but formed a special class, together with Franco’s Spain. The American political scientist Fisk (1971, 292), after an\nextended stay in Yugoslavia, considered that it was “becoming a Rechtsstaat”. Even one of the most important figures in the\nfield, Sabrina Ramet (2006) has not employed the term “totalitarian” in describing any part of the socialist era in Yugoslavia.18 It is true any reconsideration of interethnic relations would have produced such an uncontrolled situation if not channeled - as the future would prove.\n19 Although these instances were rare, the case of Vojislav \x02Se\x02selj should be mentioned. He was sentenced in Bosnia for what he wrote, and much was\ninvested in his release on the part of the civil society in formation. But \x02Se\x02selj proved not to be democratic in stature but a pernicious ethno-nationalist.\n', 'S. Flere, R. Klanj\x02sek / Communist and Post-Communist Studies 47 (2014) 237e245244We would thus argue that the Yugoslavia of Tito is almost impossible to slot into a classification of political systems. In\nregard to the issue of totalitarianism, it seems that Yugoslavia only came close to being a totalitarian regime in its first phase,\nthat is, in the period from 1945 to 1953. As early as the mid-60s, however, the elements of polyarchy were present in the\nlegitimate defense by participants of the interests of their historical regions as they comprehended them.\nThis said we would like to emphasize that this does not mean that Yugolsavia was democratic in any sense. In addition,\nwhat has been argued here should be understood in the context of the concept used. It maywell be that, were a different, that\nis, toned-down, more muddled, concept to be used, the interpretation of what Yugoslavia would have been different.\nNevertheless, would using a different conceptualization of totalitarianism help to explain Tito’s state? Would it be possible\nthat such a mould would better fit Yugoslavia under Tito? We do not think so. For example, even given the elements suggested\nby Kassof (1964), the issues regarding the classification of Yugoslavia would still remain. Specifically, although Tito’s\nstate did progressively exert less pressure upon its citizens (with political coercion incompatiblewith democratic standards of\nhuman rights occurring occasionally only), by its own measures of rationality, or by general measures of instrumental rationality,\nthe state did not become more functional, did not come closer to being able to operate economically and politically\nin a viable manner, as would stem from Kassof’s (1964) writing. In both ways the institutional policies were utopian and out of\ncontact with reality, ever more so as time passed. In addition, the system of social stratification, although social disparities\nwere always a policy issue, they turned out to bemainly a product of spontaneous forces, with education turning out to be the\nmain variable producing distinction (Flere, 1994, 120; Popovi\x03c et al., 1977; Hafner Fink, 1988), of educational policy (which\nalways remained under the jurisdiction of republics and provinces), of controls on industry and agriculture, of youth organizations\n(for which it can be said at least what was said for the LCY, besides some extra-systemic initiatives springing from\nthem, like the 1970 requests that higher education students be awarded salaries), of literature and art, would continue to defy\neasy classification of Yugoslavia. This is also true when thinking of sociology, which in the then state was typical of a plurality\nof positions, and often regarded by the regime with suspicion as an anti-systemic force (Flere, 1994, 116e124) and not vice\nversa, as Kassof (1964) found in Russia.\nNext, it should also be mentioned that our analysis was not an elaboration of the political structure of Tito’s Yugoslavia; it\nwas limited only to analyzing whether it could be considered totalitarian in the strict sense. We also did not enter into the\nparticularities of political life in the various republics and provinces, although thesewere certainly relevant and substantial20.\nDespite these limitations, our findings point toward the fact that Yugoslavia cannot easily be compartmentalized. They\nalso generate questions about the assertion of communist totalitarianism being non-reformable (Kirkpatrick, 1979; Friedrich\nand Brzezinski, 1956). True, the Yugoslav case cannot be generalized, because it was not only a complex multi-ethnic system,\nbut also a system in gradual dissolution. It is also true that Yugoslav communists “took their words seriously” regarding the\nvoluntary and essentially contractual nature of Yugoslavia (Jovi\x03c, 2009), thus also contributing to the processes of dissolution,\nfinally and to “an interlinked failure” of many organs (Wachtel and Bennett, 2009, 13).References\nAlexander, S., 1979/2008.

Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA.20 At least one interesting attempt to analyze this issue was the study of political culture in some of the republics by Bertsch and Zaninovich (1974). In a\nstudy where data were collected in 1967e1968, the authors found that in Macedonia a traditionalist political culture prevailed, in contrast to Slovenia,\nwhere a “decentralist-competitive” one did. They also consistently found League of Communists members to be less parochial minded as to political culture\n(1971), in comparison to the rest of the populace studied. Differences in outlook among republics were “diluted” by “League of Communists membership”\n(1974, 242; Zaninovich, 1971). Thus, on the one hand, strong differences were found; on the other, Communist members appear as counter-authoritarian.\nFinally, as early as the 60s, Yugoslav authorities allowed such an investigation to be carried out, on a sensitive issue involving into inter-republic differences\nin culture and politics.\n', 'S.
