The federal government has\naided no in the construction and mainte\nnance ot our levees, and the system which\nhas been combatted so strenuously ns a\nheresy in theory and an impossibility in\nfact, has been demonrtrated to be a\nsu ;ce*3\nWhen we began under the present or\nganizations twenty years ago, to make\nour fight against thefloods of the Father\nof Waters, we realized that it was a\nfight for life. The most fertile land* in\nall the world, timbered with forests of\ninestimable value, were to be reclaimed\nif we could win the fight, or remain the\nhabitat of the wild beast* if we lost. Jt\nwas a tremendous undertaking, and thr\nprospect of success was remote; but the\npossibilities which that success promised\ninspired us to proportion our efforts to\nthe magnitude of the task before us, and\nthe results have surpassed even our\nbrightest hopes. Such indeed has been\nthe success of the levee system since the\ngreat flood of 1890, which inundated nil\nthe territory of the lower district and a\nconsiderable portion of tile upper dis\ntrict, that in 1903, with a higher stage\nat Cairo and a bigger flood to contend\nagainst, 85 per cent of the lower district\nnnd all of tlie tipper district escaped\nore flow.\nWith such a record behind us, we cnn\nhope with much confidence for ultimate\nsuccess. Let us uot, however, lay the\nflattering unction to our soul that the\nfight is over. The price of our success\nmust be eternal vigilance.\nWe have demonstrated that the levee\nsystem is a success, nnd with the data\ngathered during the past twenty years\nthe engineers cnn now estimate with\nreasonable certuinty the dimensions and\ncost of the ultimate grade.\nThe question of natioual aid in this\nmatter of levee building is to Its the\nquestion of paramount importance, and\nit is the sense of this meeting that our\nrepresentative in congress can best serve\nthe interest of his constituents by devot\ning his time and talents to that subject.\nWe are fully aware of the fact that what\never can be accomplished by kim in con\ngress will depend upon his assignment to\nthe proper committee, and it is therefore\nthe most earnest prayer ol this body\nthat the speaker of the fifty-eighth con\ngress assign him to the committee on\nrivers and harbors.\nWe are most heartily in favor of\nnational aid for the levees ol Arkansas\nand Louisiana, and we know that our\nrepresentative in congress will unite\nwith the representatives of these sister\nstates in common fight for the levee\nsystem from Cairo to the Gulf.\nIn view, however, of the fact that both\nsides of the Mississippi river are equally\nvitally interested iu the improvement of\nthe river and the building and mainte\nnance oflevees, and of the further fact\nthat the west bank is now so ably rep\nresented on the committee on rivers and\nharbors by Hon. J. E. Ransdell.of Louis\nf flia an no 1 avflnt\njustice can best be done by giving the\neast bank of the river like representation\nand therefore we earnestly recommend\nthe appointment of our present repre\nsentative, Hon. B. G. Humphreys.\nOrdered this 8th day of Sept., 1903.\nJ. G. COLLIER, President.\n- —————\nVardaman\'s Inauguration.\nThere has been much speculation since\ntht lust primary, which lesultcd In the\nnomination for governor of Hon. Jas. K.\nVardaman, as to when he would lie\ninaugurated and assume the duties of\nhis office. First of all he has to be duly\nelected at the general election to be held\non Tuesday after the hi st Monday in\nNovember, 1903. This will be the third\nduy of the month, the first Monday be\ning the second. After this election the\nreturns are sent to the secretary of state\nwho files them in his office until the leg\nlature meets, which will be on Tuesday\nafter the first Monday in January, being\nthe 5th day of the month. One week\nafter the legislature has been in session\nthe secretary of state gives to the speaker\nof the house the returns of the election.\nThev are opened by tjie speaker in the\npresence of the house and canvassed,and\nthe result declined one week after, when\nthe newly elected governor takes the\noath of office, and enters upon the dis\ncharge of his duties as governor. This\nwill make Gov. Vardaman\'s inaugura\ntion tuke place on Tuesday, January 19,\n1904-. Gov. Lnngiuo was inaugurated\non the 16tli of January, 1900, t wo weeks\nafter the legislature had been i.i session.\nNo special preparations for the occasion\nore yet being discussed by the friends of\nthe goviinor-to-be, though it is not un\nlikely that it vviJI be u memorable event\niu the ln»yF\\t>f the stale.—Yazoo City\nHerald\nSquibs from the State Press.\nIt is said whnt is worrying t’ne delta\nplanters most just now is, liow they nre\ngoing to get laborers this fall to pick\nthe big crop Hint the cotton fields now\npromise.—Hattiesburg Progress.\nThe only way by which tile people of j\nMississippi will ever get good roads will,\nhe by building them. It is well enough\nto talk about them, but talk is cheap,\nwhile action counts.—Natchez Bulletin.\nProm tlie returnsof the county pension\nrolls it appears that the number of pel •\nsioners in the state is going to he mate\nrially increased, which will proportion\nately decrease the amount received hr\neach.—Raymond Gazette.\nSegregation is not the remedy for the\nrace question. The negro is herewith\nus, and there is little doubt that he will\nhere remain. Repeal the fourteenth and\nfifteenth amendments to tlie federal con\nstitution and there will be no more race\nissue forever.—Yazoo Sentinel.\nThe real cause of Major Vardamcr.’s\nmagnificent victory is the fact that lie\nmade an honest and clean campaign on\na platform of his own making, and his\ncompetency for the place being apparent,\nlie was nominated in spite of the abuse\nand slander continually hurled at him.—\nClarksdale Challenge.\nAll this "hot air” about the negroes\nleaving the state on account of Varda\nnian’s election is to absurd for a sensible\nman to notice. The average negro don’t\ncare a d—n whether we have a governor\nor not—give him a peck of meal and a\ngaod rabbit dog and he is the happiest\nman on earth and Wouldn\'t swap places\nwith Mr. Vardaman.—Canton Times.\nMajor Vardanian had no mercenary\nsupport among tlie press of the state,\nhut the papers which were for him labor\ned earnestly, fearlessly and diligently\nthat he might be successful. While they\nadmired him, they had the Interests of\ntlie whole state more at heart, and be\nlieved it wnnld fare better with him in\nthe executive chair.—Newton Record.\nThe administration of Governor Var\ndamnn will be one of progress, conserva\natism nod wisdom. Honest in every\nfibre of his nature, lie will study the in\nterests of the whole people and give\nthem a clean, business administration,\nfree from jobs and partisan politics. No\ncharges of corruption will ever lie made\nagainst his administration and the\npeople who will be closest to him will be\ndrawn from the ranks of the purest and\nwisest men of thestate.—Tupelo Journal.\nNo Promises Made.\nGreenwood, Miss., Sept. 7.—(Special\nto Commercial-Appeal)—Major Jas. K.\nVardanian left on the afternoon train\nto-day for Gulfport, where he goes to\nattend a banquet to be given in bis\nhonor at the Great Southern Hotel to\nmorrow. When seen by your corres\npondent just before leaving he said :\n“I have no news to give out. I shall\nspend a few days on the coast and after\nthat I shall return home to go to work\nin earnest. You may say, however, to\niny friends to whom I am indebted for\ntelegrams, letters of congratulations and\nother letters of inquiry regarding the\nadministration of the functions of the\noffice of governor, that I shall answer\nthem later. It may not be out of place\nfor me to repeat here for the benefit of\nthose interested, that I have not made a\npromise, direct or implied, to appoint\nany one to office, and shall not until I\nenter upon the discharge of the duties of\nthe office of governor. In these matters\nI shall proceed with the utmost delibera\ntion, looking only to the promotion of\nthe public interest.

The mammoth trees, with\ntheir drooping moss, hanging low to\nthe water\'s edge, Intermingled with\nshiny palms and luxuriant ferns,\nstamp the scene as tropical.
