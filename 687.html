The decrease in basic \nresources like water, has already been identified as a driver of violent conflicts, which have \ngiven way to the strengthening of terrorist organizations that used the environment as a \ntool of coercion. The damage caused to the earth’s ecosystem has additionally raised a \nwave of defensive activism that was initially considered as eco-terrorism. While the original \neco-movements had not induced fatalities, recent extremist organizations are showing a \nmore violent anti-progress and pro-environment agenda. Added to these, the response of \nthe states against environmental activism initiatives, has spiked some concerns over the \nrepression of civil liberties, which may have the potential to fuel the angering of extreme \nindividuals, who can be prompted to take radicalized action. Using open source data, this \narticle shows that environmental terrorism represents an increasing security threat, which \nin the future, might be worsened by the individual radicalization of marginalized \nenvironmental extremists. \nAcknowledgements \nI wish to thank Ms Gabriela L.

The unsustainable exploitation of natural resources and \nmodern humans’ creation of scarcity have unleashed unprecedented \nclimate variability and ecosystems collapse.1 As humans compete for \nincreasingly limited recourses, there is now a broader consensus that \nthe effects of climate change will contribute with an increase in internal \nconflicts.2 This could resonate with the Malthusian discourse, which \nstates that the weight of population will be greater than the power of \nthe environment to produce sustainable resources.3 In such scenario, \nthe shortages of water, food, or land could fuel internal fights and \npolitical violence.4 The effects of climate change are effectively driving \nmass migration of climate refugees, which together with the escalation \nof internal conflicts are largely favoring terrorism activities.5 This \nappears to be setting seeding grounds for terrorists’ development, \nnurturing a feedback loop of increased environmental insecurity \nfollowed by an intensification in the security threat of these actors.6 \n \nIn response to States’ climate inaction and animal rights, a movement \nof civil activism has arose in recent years, which engaged in radical \npractices that have been termed as eco-terrorism.7 These \nenvironmental extremists have been associated with organizations as \nthe Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and the Animal Liberation Front \n(ALF), whose actions da Silva and Liddick linked to an eco-terrorism \nwave.8 As these groups do not generally seek harming human life, but \nonly property, which they consider as ecologically destructive, their \nactions align more with those of ecotage that is violence against \ninanimate objects and not directly with terrorism.9 Many have argued \ntherefore, that while the activities of these groups matched illegal \nbehaviors as sabotage, arson or trespassing, their intentions \nsignificantly differed with those of terrorism.10 Yet, they have been \nconsidered terrorists due to the uncritical acceptance of the term ecoterrorism,\nand its application to these kinds of illegal activities.11   \n \nOn the other hand, the rise of organizations with more radical agendas, \nsuch as the Individualities Towards the Savagery (ITS), which \ndisregards human life and holds violent ideologies against progress and \ntechnologies, may challenge that proposition.12 As more developed \ndemocracies are moving towards considering environmentalists as a \nsecurity threat, there are concerns about an increased state led \noppression of civil liberties against climate change activists.13 These \nSpadaro: Climate Change and Environmental Terrorism\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2020\n', ' 59 \npolicies can prompt further popular discontent and push the most \nextreme activists towards radicalized movements such as the ITS.  \n \nMost international organizations, as the United Nations, the European \nCommunity, and the G7, have come now to recognize the effects of \nclimate change as a security threat.14 The United States National \nSecurity Strategy report of 2014, had already acknowledged that \nclimate change was going to be a catalyst for political violence and a \ngeneral security threat multiplier.15 In line with those concerns, groups \nsuch as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) for example, have \nalready shown their capacity to leverage the environment, by targeting \nwater resources as tools to manipulate the population.16 Therefore, the \ntactics used by ISIS in Syria and Iraq, where they target the \nenvironment to induce fear for political goals, represents another \nexample of environmental terrorism.  \n \nIt follows, that climate change has been linked to two different forms of \nterrorism. First, eco-terrorism, where individuals used violence against \nproperties and civil rights in defense of the environment or to direct \nchanges in environmental policy. Second, environmental terrorism, \nwhere the destruction of the environment, either through war or acts of \nterror, was used to exert fear in the population to achieve \norganizational aims.  \n \nUsing publicly available data, this article examined the basic evidence \nfor links between climate stress and terrorism. The existence of an ecoterrorism\nmovement and the strategic use of environmental resources \nby already stablished terrorist organizations were explored. This article \nconcludes that there is not enough evidence to claim the existence of a \ncurrent threat of eco-terrorism; however, extreme groups such as the \nITS may be of concern. There is instead a more consistent body of \nliterature exposing that stressed resources, and increased conflicts due \nto climate change, provide terrorists with the opportunity to develop \nnew strategies and to extend grounds for recruitment. This would be in \nline with the current development of environment terrorism. \nAdditionally, the states’ increasing repression on environmental \nactivism may have the potential to trigger these actors into a \nradicalized stage that could eventually develop in a violent antiprogress\nextremism. \n \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 13, No. 4\nhttps://digitalcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol13/iss4/5\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.13.4.1863\n', ' 60 \nThe Links between Climate Change and Terrorism \nClimate Change and its Environmental Effects  \n \nIn about 200 years, the human population grew from just over 1 billion \nto nearly 8 billion (Figure 1-A), and most of this growth was placed in \nurban areas (Figure 1-B).17 While the yearly population change slowed \ndown from the late 80s onward (Figure 1-A), people density per square \nkilometer has continued to climb during the same period (Figure 1-B).18 \nThe footprint of these trends followed by a considerable increase in the \naverage carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, particularly \nfrom the 1960s onward (Figure 1-C).19 Similarly, a marked temperature \nrise, for both, land and oceans, were noted since 1980 (Figure 1-D).20  \n \nFigure 1.

Over the last \ncentury, the sheer volume of human water usage, has contributed with \nan exacerbated trend of fresh water consumption (Figure 2-A).25 \nRenewable internal flow, including river water flows and groundwater \nfrom rainfall represents a good indicator of water security and scarcity \nin relation to population measures.26 Recent reports show that the per \ncapita availability of renewable freshwater resources has fallen sharply \nsince the 1960s (Figure 2-A), sending regions such as North Africa, \nMiddle East and South Asia into extremely high levels of water stress.27 \nData collected by the Pacific Institute Project on the world’s water \nresources conflicts, further exposes a sharp increase in the number of \nconflicts in recent years, which doubled in the last decade compared to \nthe previous one (Figure 2-B).28 The vast majority of the conflicts that \ntook place from 2010 to 2019 were located in Western Asia, SubSaharan\nAfrica, and Southern Asia (totalizing over 70 percent of all \nconflicts).29  \n \nFigure 2.

Left uncontrolled, this could set the \ngrounds for the development of climate change linked-terrorism. \nEnvironmental-Linked Terrorism  \n \nSpadaro: Climate Change and Environmental Terrorism\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2020\n', ' 63 \nDuring the Gulf War in 1991, the Iraqi forces led to large oil spills in the \nPersian Gulf and the torching and sabotaging of multiple oil wells that \nprompted significant smoke and oily clouds that obscured the area for \ndays.39 Then president George Bush soon classified these acts as \nenvironmental terrorism.40 More generally, they denoted a methodical \nmilitary strategy in disrupting the environment to use it as tool of war, \nwhich was more akin to an environmental warfare.41 The events \nnonetheless, sparked a debate within the already contested \nconceptualization of terrorism, as to define which actions could be \nconsidered in the realm of environmental terrorism.42  \n \nWhile there are still many arguments around defining terrorism, a \ngeneral view is that terrorism requires a “deliberate use or threat to use \nviolence against civilians in order to attain political, ideological, or \nreligious aims.”43 In line with this take, it was outlined that the \nobjectives of terrorism are directed to coerce a political course of \naction, whereas its means always include “the use or threat of use of \nviolence… that is directed at a symbolic target.”44 What differentiate \nterrorism from other forms of violence, is the fear of that symbolic \nviolence against the larger population.45 Thereafter, environmental \nterrorism takes place when the symbolic violence disrupts the \nenvironment.46  \n \nIn consequence, environmental terrorism requires an intentional act, \nor threat, of violence directly against the environment, through either \nwar or terror. Such violence creates indiscriminate fear, due to the \npernicious consequences of the destruction of the environment, which \nwill eventually cause direct harm to the population. Lastly, the overall \nobjective of the attacks is to force political decisions.  \n \nThe Threat of Eco-Terrorism  \n \nThe debate over the classification of environmental terrorism soon \nturned into the construction of an eco-terrorism threat. The Animal \nand Earth Liberation Movement (AELM), which included several \nenvironmentalists and animal’s rights groups, came to be considered \npart of a so-called eco-terrorism surge.47 The Animal Liberation Front \n(ALF) and the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) appeared to be the most \ndistinctive organizations in this movement. \n \nThe ELF may represent a blend of anarchists and apocalyptic \nextremists whose philosophies are rooted in Marxism, socialism, \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 13, No. 4\nhttps://digitalcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol13/iss4/5\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.13.4.1863\n', ' 64 \nfeminism, postmodernism and Eastern religions, and who strived for \nthe end of modern civilization.48 The organization’s views were further \nlinked to the likes of Theodore Kaczynski, and it was signaled as a \nthreat to nuclear facilities.49 The ALF instead, drifted from groups such \nas Greenpeace and was more concerned with animal rights issues, but \nwas considered to act in solidarity with the ELF.50 Both groups were \nfurther argued as the main drivers of an overlooked wave of EcoTerrorism\nthreat, which extended from 1980 to 2012.51 It was also \nsuggested, that organizations such as the ELF and the ALF could be \nequated to Al-Qaeda and ISIS ideological war, which were matched by \na cult of nature and antagonizing stand against western democracies \nbased on a “bi-centric vision with equally violent means.”52 The Global \nTerrorism Database (GTD) produced by the National Consortium for \nthe Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), \nUniversity of Maryland, contains records of worldwide terrorist events \nsince 1970.53 From that dataset, it becomes apparent that the \ncomparison might not be as linear, considering that both, Al-Qaeda, \nand its affiliates and ISIS, lunched a total 8,445 attacks causing at least \n54,164 deaths from 1992 to 2018.54 Yet, such narratives propelled a \nstrong official countering intelligence response in the United States, \nwhich eventually suffocated these movements.55 \n \nFor others, these groups were considered part of a movement of \nmovement that pursued the defense of the environment and animal \nrights by committing crimes of economic sabotage, but who rejected \nviolence against individuals and did not intend to provoke a sense of \nfear.56 In this view, the modus operandi and history of behavior of the \nELF for example, was wrongly interpreted as eco-terrorism, as it only \namounted to an unlawful form of political militancy.57 It was further \nstated that the coining of the term ecoterrorism itself, was unjustly \nbuilt in the United States through by private corporative lobbies, mass \nmedia bias, and global warming deniers, which overall staged a \nvilification of radical environmentalists and permeated the government \nresponse.58 From all of the ALF and ELF incidents noted from 1979 to \n2010, none resulted in physical injuries or fatalities, and yet they were \nmet with a strong intelligence joint task force and a counter-terrorism \nstrategy that was largely led by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Intelligence \n(FBI).59 \n \nThe GTD data verifies the activity of the organizations involved in the \neco-terrorism movement (Figure 3).60 The ALF has allegedly claimed a \nrecent number of vandalism acts in the United States.61 \nSpadaro: Climate Change and Environmental Terrorism\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2020\n', ' 65 \nNotwithstanding those claims, the latest attacks recorded by the GTD, \nwere in 2016, and 2015 for the ELF (Figure 3).62 The two groups \ncombined launched 189 attacks from 1984 to 2016, but those attacks \ndid not provoke any fatalities.63 This justifies the debate that the acts \nperformed by these kinds of groups relate to illegal activities against \nproperty such as vandalism, sabotage, or trespassing, which may not \ndirectly equate to acts of terrorism.64 However, the broadening of the \nconcept of domestic terrorism by the FBI in 2002, which included \nattacks on property, and the uncritical acceptance of the term ecoterrorism\ninstead of ecotage, led to the treatment of these \nenvironmental activists as terrorists.65 \n \nOther organizations related to the ALEM movement, however, have \nshown to adopt creeds that are violent. The Justice Department (JD), a \ngroup that resonated in 1999 with 14 attacks (Figure 3), was effectively \na splinter from the ALF, but different from the central group, it aspired \nto utilize violence against people.66 Whereas the JD went virtually \nextinct in 2010, the Animals Right Extremists (ARE), a similarly violent \norganization resurged in 2017 (Figure 3).67  \n \nA reviving trend for the ARE and the ITS was also recorded in recent \nyears (Figure 3). The ITS has already caused 37 deaths since 2011, and \ntogether with the ARE, they remain the only extreme \nenvironmentalism organizations to have ever caused casualties.68  This \nalready suggests that these actors may pose a different threat as that of \nthe original ALEM movement.  \n \nOriginated in Mexico in 2011, the ITS was part of an international ecoanarchist\nmovement, which had a violent profile and an inclination to \nuse low reach bombs against pro-nuclear lobbies and scientists.69 \nInspired by winds of eco-fascism and the Ted Kaczynski’s manifests, \nthe ITS openly declared its decision to take violent action against \npeople that were advancing technology and destroying the wilderness.70 \nThe group continues to pledge for indiscriminate violence against \nprogress, and while is now active in Chile and Mexico, it has recently \nclaimed responsibility for attacks in Greece.71  \n \nThe Deep Green Resistance (DGR) is another young organization \nholding radical anti-civilization - anti-progress agendas that is also \nrapidly expanding.72 Its methodical strategic plan, and its tendency \ntowards violence, have catapulted this green-anarchist group, together \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 13, No. 4\nhttps://digitalcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol13/iss4/5\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.13.4.1863\n', ' 66 \nwith the ITS, as a worrying bioterrorism threat.73 However, this \norganization does not register attacks on the GTD. \n \nFigure 3. Terrorist Attacks Linked to the Eco-Terrorism Movement. \n \nSource: Data from Global Terrorism Database, (GTD, 2019), START, University of \nMaryland. https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/.74 Note: The groups included within the \nEco-Terrorism movement showed a heightened activity during the years 1998 to \n2005, but showed a significantly lower number of attacks for the last five years. (The \ndata used for the groups considered, included the words: Environment, Eco, Wild, \nEarth, Animal and Justice Department, with at least 3 attacks from 1970 to 2018, or \nat least 1 attack since 2014).  \n \nThere is also a current increase in extreme right violence, coupled with \nthe rise of groups based on eco-fascists, or anarcho-primitivism \nviews.75 In attention to this, the coming of an ecologically justified neofascism\ntrend, identified as the Avocado Politics, may become a climate \nchange related threat.76 Under this view, the green rhetoric of climate \nchange and the environmental emergency, may justify an agenda that \nincludes white restricted opportunities, the need for preservation of a \nperceived superior race, hoarding of the powerful and a justification for \nexclusion.77  Considering that the ITS shares some of those views, the \nmomentum could re-ignite a transnational radical movement with the \npotential to grow into the once trumpeted eco-terrorism threat.  \n \nOverall, the movement linked with eco-terrorism has traditionally \nengaged in illegal acts of ecotage to pursue environmental policy \nSpadaro: Climate Change and Environmental Terrorism\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2020\n', ' 67 \nchanges. The movement has caused damage to civil rights and \nproperties they considered ecologically destructive, but has not been \ncharacterized by targeting the environment, nor any human lives. \nWhile the classification of its participants as terrorists might be \ncontested, the development of groups such as the ITS warrants its \nmonitoring.  \n \nLooming Threats \n \nThe lack of consistency in defining eco-terrorism or environmental \nterrorism has given oxygen to ill constructed policies and State \nresponses. Other academics seemingly challenged  the initial \necoterrorism perceptions nurtured within the United States, and \nconsidered ecoterrorism to represent a minority of the actions exerted \nby radical environmentalists that were not central to the movement’s \nobjectives.78 The Institute for Economic & Peace (IEP), which yearly \nreviews the Global Terrorism Index based on the GTD records, \nrecognizes only three broad categories of terrorism, namely: Political, \nnationalist or separatist and religious.79 The IEP further notes that \nenvironmental terrorists are more likely to be affiliated to a specific \nterrorist group, their activity overlaps with the main types of terrorism, \nand that they are unlikely to target the loss of life as a main goal.80  \n \nYet, the hardening of the state’s policies against environmental activists \nhas been re-ignited across the globe, and the increasing influence of \ninternational corporations into state powers has further encouraged \naggressive expansionist politics at a potential cost for civil rights.81 This \nis leaving a diminished capacity for a system of control to private \nambitions, which may only encourage radical forms of reactive \nactivism.82 States are now resonating the term eco-terrorism to avert \npotential dangerous environmental activism, targeting protestors as \nterrorists with extreme outcomes for the protection of civil liberties.83 \n \nFor example, at least a dozen of environmental activists were deported \nback, or denied entry to Poland, in occasion of the 2018 United Nations \nClimate conference in Katowice, because they were considered a threat \nto the national security.84 During 2019, forty-six environmental \nactivists were killed in the Philippines, because these people were \ncategorized as terrorists in light of the anti-terrorism bill passed by the \ngovernment of Duterte in 2019.85 This followed the decision of \npresident Duterte in 2018 to place 600 indigenous and environmental \nright advocates, which included a United Nations special \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 13, No. 4\nhttps://digitalcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol13/iss4/5\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.13.4.1863\n', ' 68 \nrepresentative, into a terrorist list.86 In the United States, corporative \nlobbies influencing congress members seem to be claiming that \nenvironmental militants and indigenous protestors should be treated as \nterrorists.87 These lobbies further pushed for the passing of a bill that \nwould curtail these dangerous actions and stop terrorism.88  \n \nIn line with these views, the United Kingdom has recently included \nGreenpeace and Extinction Rebellion, alongside various extremist right \nwing groups, in the police counter-terrorism guide used in an antiradicalization\ncampaigns across the country.89 While this was seen by \nsome as a sign of a worsened persecution of environmental activists, \nAustralia has engaged in a similar trend including in its 2015 counterterrorism\nbooklet, examples of environmental activism as a road to \nradicalization.90 The UK police have further used reproachable tactics \nof infiltration and incapacitating protest policing strategies against \nenvironmental activists, exposing the inadequacy and exaggerated \nmoniker of domestic extremism opposed to these groups.91 This is an \nominously development which might see the reactions of climate \nchange activists being met with an asymmetrical state response and the \nrepression of civil liberties, all in the name of counter terrorism.  \n \nIEP experts have declared that government’s inaction and lack of trust \nin democratic process may see those behind a climate change \nmovement to reach a tipping point and retort to violence.92 The recent \ncomeback from the ITS, which also visits the lines of the likes of the \nFreedom Club organization, inspired in Ted Kaczynski legacy, could \nturn into a beacon for eco-fascist groups.93 While eco-movements were \ntraditionally linked to the left, in times of an increased threat from \nright wing activism, these actors can notice the rhetoric of antiimmigration\nand militarization of resources in response to the climate \ncrisis, and potentially engage in environmental linked-extremism.94  \n \nAccordingly, this tipping point, could be reached from the left and right \nextreme of the ideological spectrum. The problem of climate change is \ntherefore a common ground for potentially radicalized individuals from \nboth extremes, who have negative views against progress, technologies, \nincreased population trends, and immigration movements. For some, \nthis tendency may also represent a future risk for the rise of a \ndangerous ideology identified as bioconservatism.95  \n \nIn times of generalized popular upset, the role of negative climate \npolicies can be of concern. As reviewed by others, dominant groups \nSpadaro: Climate Change and Environmental Terrorism\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2020\n', ' 69 \nwithin a society may have privileged access to resources, a situation \nthat some states may protect by marginalizing minorities.96 These \nostracized members may then engage in violence to restore the \ndiscriminative grievance, overall exposing the importance of equality \nbefore the law and the protection of civil rights to avoid setting the \ngrounds for domestic terrorism in modern states.97  \n \nConsequently, increasing state repression and loss of civil rights \ncoupled with the decline in essential resources availability can \npotentially exacerbate popular turmoil as a last resort against \ngovernments’ climate inactions. These conflicts can potentially set the \ngrounds for radical individuals to tip the point and trigger a form of \nideological terrorism based on an environmental creed. As these \nindividuals target the preservation of the environment, this threat may \ntake a new form of eco-terrorism, where not only property, but also \nlives could be at risk.  \n \nConflicts and Environmental Terrorism  \n \nClimate change and the stress it places in environmental resources, has \nbeen linked to conflicts of various nature. For some, this relationship \nhas smaller effects within country-armed conflicts, as compared to \nother drivers of conflicts.98 Others have shown that climate stressors \nare linked to increased opportunity for violence and conflicts in areas of \nlow living standards and poor governance.99  \n \nHowever, climate change has now been recognized to fuel greater \npolitical instability and conflicts due to resources competition and \nincreasing global insecurity that places the most affected areas at the \nmercy of insurgencies, organized crime, and terrorism recruitment.100 \nIn support of that concept, extreme temperature deviations in the SubSaharan\nregion have been linked to an increased risk of political \nviolence in the form of protesting and rioting.101 Similarly, broad \ntemperature increase patters were further correlated to an increased \nrisk of conflicts, and a potential worsening of climate change \nadaptability.102  \n \nThe resources affected by climate change are multiples, yet the struggle \nfor water, is at the forefront of this race. The lack of water, particularly \nin already highly stressed areas as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, is giving \nterrorists tactical advantages who, by cutting its supply or \ncontaminating its sources, are employing a form of environmental.103 \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 13, No. 4\nhttps://digitalcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol13/iss4/5\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.13.4.1863\n', ' 70 \nThese strategic advantages have been exploded by different terrorist \norganizations. Al-Shabaab, for example, has moved from a weakened \nposition due to government retaliation, to exert control over water \nsupply chains to the cities, reinstating by these means a demonstration \nof authority without even holding those cities.104 The group has learnt \nthat losing its strategic power over water supply points may mean their \ndemise, and therefore it maintains effective control over the rivers \nsurrounding cities and routes of access to fresh water.105  \n \nThe Sahel region of Africa is a hotspot for climate change-linked \ninstability, and it is anticipated to give local terrorist organizations \nfurther opportunities for development. Groups such as Boko Haram, \nAl-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the Movement for Oneness \nand Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA, also known by its French \nacronyms, MUJAO) may have an increased prospect to radicalize the \npopulation against the states further.106 This is a prime region for water \nrelated conflicts, where for the struggles surrounding the Lake Chad \nBasin for example, have set climate change consequences as a conflict \nrisk multiplier.107 Resources insecurity has pushed the northeast region \nof Nigeria to fall under an extreme risk of famine, and placed 7 million \npeople at emergency levels of food insecurity, rising political grievance, \nand conflicts over water and land.108 In such scenarios, Boko Haram \nhas not missed the opportunity to explode the inhabitants around the \nmain river basins and added focal risk factors for the regional \nhydropower resources.109 \n \nTemperature changes alone can be a concerning risk for the \ndevelopment of terrorism in some countries within the Sahel. It has \nbeen shown that an increase in mean temperatures, particularly in \nNigeria, has an incremental effect on the probability of terror events, \nwhere by every 1 centigrade increase the likelihood of Islamism \nterrorism surges by 4 to 6 percent.110 These authors argued that \nescalating ethnic/religious heterogeneity is a factor in the surge of \nviolence and conflicts, which in the case of Nigeria; it also increases the \nState’s odds for the occurrence of terror events.111 These are not issues \nonly linked to Africa. The dawn of the Arab Spring in Syria, has exposed \nthe menace of environmental and provided evidence for the possible \nsecurity consequences of climate change.  \n \nWater scarcity and extended droughts have been cited amongst major \nfactor in driving the political instability that resulted in the Syrian civil \nwar.112 For years, Syrians were ravaged by droughts and water shortage \nSpadaro: Climate Change and Environmental Terrorism\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2020\n', ' 71 \nthat significantly hurt crops yields and destroyed the livelihood of \nhundreds of thousands of farmers, affecting 1.3million Syrians and \nleaving other 2 to 3 million living in extreme poverty.113 The Assad \nregime did not support the affected areas, mismanaged the water, and \ncut subsidies to farmers, which led to the internal displacement of rural \ninhabitants towards the cities, where they were only met with rising \nunemployment and government neglect.114 Most of these so-called \nclimate refugees were relegated to the outskirts of cities such as Aleppo \nand Damascus, or were stablished in Dara, where the pro-democratic \nmovement of the Arab Spring and the uprising against the government \nstarted.115 The civil unrest was followed by a power vacuum that gave \nroom to rise of ISIS, which soon after learnt to use the environment on \nits favor.116 During the conflict, ISIS targeted water installations and \ndeviated water flows to exert control over the provision of services, \nwhich became a tool of political dominance and a psychological \nterrorism strategy.117 In 2014, ISIS extended these strategies to Iraq \nwhere the group closed local dams, effectively leaving large areas under \ndraught stress, and threatened the Shiite community with cutting water \nsupply to their regions.118 \n \nWater stress has not been the only resource to be weaponized by ISIS. \nThe group has also noted the spread of wild fires in already stressed \nenvironments as a climate change led strategy.119 In Syria and Iraq, \nISIS has taken advantage of the dry, hot, and windy climate to use \nextended arson wildfires, driving the destruction of crops and \nagricultural resources of local farmers.120 During 2019, ISIS prompted \nthe use of fire in Syria and Iraq to punish the alleged lack of tax \npayments by regional farmers, and recently, the group used this \nmenace as a propaganda for terror, encouraging its followers to note \nbefore them the “millions of acres… to burn.”121 The use of common \narson warfare technic at the hands of terrorists, in these increasingly \nstressed environments, may only turn already extended catastrophic \nfire seasons in a completely new menace of its own.  \n \nThe states fragility and natural resources vulnerability, have not \nescaped the attention of other terrorist groups outside Syria, showing \nthat these may not be isolated events, but an escalating trend in the use \nof the environment for terrorism.122 The roadmap to the Yemeni civil \nwar involves a similarly complex web of actors and the setting of proxy \nwars.123 In such scenario, for example, increased water scarcity \nprovided tactic advantages to both, the states and non-state operators. \nSubmerged in a conflict since 2015, Yemen has been identified as one \nJournal of Strategic Security, Vol. 13, No. 4\nhttps://digitalcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol13/iss4/5\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5038/1944-0472.13.4.1863\n', ' 72 \nof the most water-stressed countries worldwide, situation that has been \naggravated due to failed government policies, increasing climate \nchange pressure and operating actors blocking either its delivery or its \naccess.124 In fragrant violation of the international laws of war, by 2018, \nthe coalition forces led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \nattacked the Yemeni civil water and electrical infrastructures more than \n100 times. 125 This contributed with a persistent outbreak of cholera, \nthe displacement of 1.3 million people and a health care system \ncollapse.126 In this ravaged scenario, the Houthi rebels have blockaded \nthe cities under their control, allegedly confiscating water at \ncheckpoints or withholding its access to enemies.127 Conversely, AlQaeda\nin the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) implemented a servicing \nstrategy of providing security by refurbishing water wells and mains.128 \nDisplaced Yemeni individuals further reported that water and energy \nscarcity started after the conflict began. 129 Water supply then fell under \nlocal governments or formalized groups, providing an example of how \nclimate change can relate to conflict-induced resources scarcity, where \nwater can be used as a weapon or a tool of control.130 \n \nConflicts and people’s marginalization from peace and resources have \nfurther become the marks for a spiraling road to terrorism recruitment. \nThe lack of trust in the government to solve the hydrological crisis in \nNigeria for instance, has sent people to a journey of frustration and \nhelplessness, which has taken many in the search of alternative \nlivelihoods to join Boko Haram.131 The negative effects that lowered \nliving conditions due to intensifying droughts can inflict at a personal \nlevel have also been shown to influence individual motivations and \nbolster the likelihood of a personal decision to join political violence.132 \nState failure to provide for human security, including basic civil rights \nand god governance, has equally been linked to the ability of terrorist \ngroups, as Boko Haram, to polarize individuals towards joining their \norganizations.133 The areas most affected by extreme weather events \nand increased scarcity of resources therefore, become vulnerable spots \nfor recruitment, where terrorist groups can offer means of life, \neconomic viability and grievance appeasement.134 \n \nThese precedents demonstrate an increased targeting of the \nenvironment to induce fear in the population as to achieve political \ngoals. In such context, attacks to an already challenged environment, \ncharacterizes environmental terrorism. The future shaping of this \nthreat may take unpredictable forms as climate change consequences \ncontinue to unfold.  \nSpadaro: Climate Change and Environmental Terrorism\nProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2020\n', ' 73 \nConclusion \nClimate change is an associated factor to the increase of violent \nconflicts and regional destabilization, which may only worsen as \ntemperature continue to rise. The escalating scarcity of basic resources \nsuch as water, the increased desertification of agricultural regions, and \nthe overall rise in temperatures have all shown to bolster political \ninstability and state fragility. The link between climate change and \nterrorism is, now, one defined by the evolution of strategies and the \nopportunity for recruitment using the environment stress as a form of \ncontrol. This is a strategy likely to be applied by state and non-state \nactors alike, and includes the damage of the environment by acts of war \nor terror, which leads to Environmental terrorism. Eco-terrorism, \nwhich traditionally included acts of ecotage in defense of the \nenvironment, and the promotion of related environmental policy \nchanges, does not appear to be a current threat. However, \nenvironmental activists are being increasingly categorized and targeted \nas terrorists by well stablished democracies. The exacerbated role of \nthese states may fuel a sense of injustice and desperateness capable of \ncompelling radical individuals to join the likes of the ITS, or to drive \nthemselves a new terrorism threat. This could trigger a security risk \neffect at the heart of advanced regions, where not yet the scarcity of \nwater, but the loss of civil rights would potentiate the rise of a new form \nof eco-terrorism. Thereafter, the conditions linked to climate change \nhave provided both, opportunity for environmental terrorism \ndevelopments in areas of resources scarcity, and a potential platform \nfor new form of terrorism born from extreme anti-progress ideologies. \nEndnotes \n \n1  Courtney Work, “Climate Change and Conflict: Global Insecurity and the Road Less \nTraveled,” Geoforum 102, (June 2019): 222-225, \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.11.004. \n2  Charlotte Collins, Climate Change and Global Security: Planning for Potential \nConflict (Washington DC: Climate Institute, 2019), http://climate.org/wpcontent/uploads/2019/09/Climate-Change-and-Global-Security-Planning-for-\nPotential-Conflict.pdf. \n3  Thomas Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population (London: Cambridge \nUniversity Press.
