He was living in\nHelena under the assumed name of\nGeorge W. Miller. He took his arrest\ncooly, saying that he expected it, and\nthat he was able to prove that he was\ninanoent, He said that he had left\nColumbus the morning of February 7,\nantld accounted for his movements since\nthent. If his story is true-and if true\nit can be proven-he can establish a\npositive alibi, The Helena Indepeud.\neut speaks of Book\'s arrest as follows:\nSheriff Davidson learned tiet Miller\nwas employed at the Northern Pacific\niee house in the Sixth ward, and ac.\noempanied by Deputy Sheriff COnskelly,\nwent there yesterday. The only man\narcund the place in any degree answer\ning the description of Beck, said that\nhis name was MoBurus. When the\nsheriff intimated that he might want to\nask himnt a few questions and told him\nwho he was, MoBurns grew pale and\nconfessed that his true name was Harp.\ner. Harper soon convinced the sheriff\nthat although he lived under an as\nsumed name, he was not the man he\nwas looikug for. About 6 o\'olock last\nevening, Sheriff Davidson and Deputy\nSheriff Cuskelly located Beck in a cab.\nin at 418 Clore strbet, where he and a\nman named Tom Wheeler were liviug\ntogether,. The sheriff asked for Miller\nand Beck, who was on the bed, replied\nthat that was his name.\n"Your name ought to be Beck,\nthough, oughtn\'t it?" inquired the\nsheriff,\n"\'\'Yes," replied Beck, hesitatingly.\nBeck knew what he was arrested for,\nWhen Sheriff Uuskelly began to search\nhim he said that he had expected to be\narrested. He said that he regretted his\narrest particularly on account of his\nbrother, A. A. Beck of Billings, well\nknown in that city. He said that he\narrived in Helena the morning of Feb.\n10, and that he had first heard uf the\nmurder of Bogner When he read, of it in\nthe Independent. Since then he had\nexpected that he might be arrested.\nHe said he had made no attempt to\nconceal himself, He had been work.\ning for the Northern Pacific company\nas a laborer two days, quitting work\nyesterday morning, and had worked at\nodd jobs about the city since his arriv\nal, He was locked up last evening\nand Sheriff George W. Hubbard of Bill\nings notified of his arrest.\nBlck lived with Bogner, who former\nly resided in Helena, in a cabin at the\nquarry of the Montana Sandstone com\npanty near Columbus, The mnorniung of\nFeb. 10, the body of Bogner was found\noutside of the cabin with a pick driven\nthrough the skull, He had been tmur.\ndared for money, there being evidences\nthat the body and the eubln lhad been\nsearched by the murderer. Suspicion\nat once attached to Beck, who had\nlived withl Boguner, aud who had quit\nwork a few days betore the murder,\nSearch was instituted for him, but no\ntraea of him was found until Sheriff\nDavldson located him yesterday., The\ncounty commlssloners of Yellowstone\ncounty offered $500 reward for the ar\nrest and conviction of the murderer,\nwhile the aoting goverqor offered $880\nreward, the town of Columbus 9800\nand the sheriff $0 reward. Ciroular\nwith the desorlption of Beck and au\nuuouniug the rewards were pent to every\nsheotiff and eity marshal in the state.\nBeck did not helsitate to tell his story\nlast eveaaning at the county jall,\n"Why did you chanle your nain@\nwhen you left Columbus?" he was\nasIad.\n"I\'ll siel you all abou ItI," he i e\nplied, \'\nBook wsn reminded that he wai\noharged wilh a serous ouime, but he\nsaid that be wanted so sell bi story.\n\'I hare nothibl to may but the truth,\nand that won\'t hkrt me." he said, "I\nwain to begll at the beglnning aid I\'ll\nolam to. tell Iyo presently wbhy\nchanged my iame. I w emplod byl\nthe Uloulteal Sadatoe company bps,\nI or 4, olard was pretty blhb Io i\npal up a :cabln ad for a ime there wm\na Swede adl notheIl man wilth me.\nThe Swede left, and then Bogner came\nto my place and I sold him a half in\nterest in the cabin. I worked until\nFeb. 6, the last pay day, and we all\ngot our checks and went to town, ex\ncept Bogner and one other man who\nworked that day. All that afternoon I\nplayed cards - played until ] or 2\no\'clock in the morning and then went\nhome with Al Newberg. That was the\nmorning of Feb. 7. I went to his house\nand staid there until a quarter of 4\no\'clock and then went to the depot.\nThe train was late that morning. I\nbought a ticket for Big Timber, and\nwhen the passenger came in at 4:20,\nI climbed aboard. Instead of getting\noff at Big Timber I paid my fare to Liv.\ningston, getting a rebate of 25 cents.\nI staid at Livingston Feb. 7, 8 and 9.\nI stopped at two hotels across from the\ndepot, and my name--the name I as\nnlored of Miller.-will be found on the\nregisters of those hotels. On the third\nevening--the evening of the ninth, I\nato supper at the Livingston hotel-I\nthink it was--and overheard a man\nsay that he was going to fire the pas\nsenger out west next morning. After\nsuppr I asked the manu if I couldn\'t\nride on the engine nod crack coal for\nhim and earn my passage to Helena,\nand he said he didn\'t know. If the\ncoal was rough, he said, he would try\nto get mn the job. I got up before\nthe passenger cane in the morning of\nFeb. 10 and went to the engine. The\nfireman said he couldn\'t take me. I\nwent and bought a ticket and then\nwent across the street and got a bottle\nof whisky. Then I returned to the\ndepot, climbed aboard and rode to Hel\nena. Walking up the street here, I\nmet a little man I used to work with,\nTom Wheeler, and we hunted up a cab\nin and went to bachin\'. He didn\'t\nhave any money, but I had a little.\n"And now Ill tell you why I\nchanged my name," continued Beck.\n" You know I had been playing cards at\nColumbus the day we were paid off.\nWell, it was poker and when I got\nthrough I found that I didn\'t have\nenough left to pay my debts. I owed\nthe storekeeper and owed some to two\nsaloons and didn\'t have enough to set\ntle. I concluded to throw up my job,\nas the -superintendent hadn\'t treated\nme just right anyway. He had low\nored my wages with the others and\nwhen he restored them again he didn\'t\ninclude me. All the rest of the boys\nsaid they were getting 25 cents, but I\nwas getting 22\' cents. I thought I\nwould go away, earn the money some\nwhere else and send it to them.\n"The first I heard of Bogner\'s mur\nder was when I read an article in the\nIndependent of Feb, 22, stating that\nrewards had been offered for the mur\nderer. The paper was dated Feb. 22,\nbut I read it Feb. 88. It was a great\nshock to me. I have lived four or five\nyears in Yellowstone county and have\nfriends there, and I won\'t have any\ntrouble in proving that I didn\'t have\nanything to do with Bogner\'s death."\nWhen Beck quit work, Bogner paid\nhim $85 for his share of provisions and\nother supplies still remaining in the\ncabin. Sheriff Davidson found no\nmoney on him yesterday, Beck is\nabout id years old.\nNOME WEAK POIN.S.\nWhy Didn\'t Reck Make His Whereabouts\nKnown?\nBeck\'s story, in the main, seems\nplausible, but it contaius some weak\npoints. For instance, when ho read\' of\nthe murder in the Independent and ex.\npected to be arrested, as he says, why\ndidn\'t he make his whereabouts known\nto the officers? He had roomed with\nBogner for several months, was the last\nnman seen with him before the murder\nand, under such oircuistauces, an in.\nnoceut man would naturally clear\nhimself of suspicion. And it also looks\nsuspicious that Beck changed his name.\nThe reason he gives-the fear that he\nwould be arrested for not paying his\ndebts-is hardly satisfactory. Beck is\na man who has knocked around the\ncountry a great deal and very likely\nknows that he committed no criminal\naot in failing to satisfy his creditors.\nBut, if he can prove his presence in\nLivingstou from the morning of the 7th\nuntil the evenung of the 9th-at saub\nan hour that he would not have had\ntime to go to Columbus and get back\non the passenger in the early morning\n-his alibi would be complete. And,\nif his story is true, he should easily be\nable to account for himself during this\ntime. The ftat should not be over.\nlooked, however, that Beok had time\nto leave Livingaton on the 9th, get to\nColumbus in time to commit the mrut\nder in the early evening (about the\nhour that Bogner was supposed to have\nbeen killed and return \'to Livingston\nto time to catch the Helena passenger.\nThis theory, of course, is exploded it\nBeook slept the early part of that night\noin a botel at Lvingston, as he says he\ndid, but if this is true, he can easily\nprove it. Hie movements after he left\nColumbus, hqwever, should be carefully\ntraced up, but Conaty Attorney Johna\nston will no doubt see to it that Beok\nis not acquitted at his preliminary ex\namination unless a clear alibi is estab.\nlisbed, At least, Beok should have\nsome idea as to who did kill Bogner,\nIt was evidently someone who knew\nwhere be carretd his money, whihb\nwas ooncealed iL the ltoliu of his\nonovan-IcCormick Co.\nSuccessore to DONOVAN & 8PEAn and PAUL MoCoRnMIC Co.,\nDEALERS IN\nGROCERIES,\nIHARDWARE, FARM IMPLEMENTS,\nHARNESS, CROCKERY,\n*O CLOTHING, BOOTS AND SHOES\nWe would respectfully ask a share of your business. *\n* Thanking you for past favors, we are;\nYours Truly,\n* Donovan-McCormick Co.\npantaloons, and was probably a mait\nwho had been in the habit of visiting\nthe cabin. Beck was thoroughly fa\nmiliar with Bogner\'s habits and should\nbe able to Inform the officers whether\nanyone else possessed the same knowl\nedge.\nNO TICKET WAS SOLD.\nOne Part of Heck\'s Story, At Least, is\nNot True.\nSpecial Correspondence to The Gazette.\nColumbus, March 5.-Charles Beck,\naccused of the murder of Joseph Bog\nner, was arraiged before Justice S~imp\nson this morning and his preliminary\nexamination set for next Friday morn\ning at 9 o\'clock. Beck is very cool and\nis very confident that he can establish\nan alibi. Be has had subpoenaed the\nnight clerk of the Mitchell house at\nLivingston, where he claims he slept\nduring the early part of the night of\nthe murder, and also the cashier of the\nMerchant\'s National bank, where he\nsays he deposited $40. Beck has writ.\nten his brother at Billings to secure an\nattorney to defend him. The accused\nclaims in his statement in the Helena\nindependent that on the night of the\n7th he bought a ticket from Columbus\nto Big Timber and went through to\nLivingston on the passenger train, but\nthe records of the railroad office here\nshow that no ticket was sold to Big\nTimber on that day. So this part of\nBeck\'s story, at least, is not true.\nSMALL BOUNTY CLAIMS.\nTotal Amount Filed During the Past\nMonth Only $1,936.\nThe smallest amount of bounty claims\nfiled with the clerk of the state board\nof examiners in many months were\nfiled last month, the total amount from\nthe different counties being but $1,986,\naccording to the usual monthly table\nCLOSING OUT SALE\n*\nHaving decided to retire from the Mercantile\nBusiness, in which we have been actively en\ngaged for the past eighteen years in the City\nSof Billings, we offer our immense stock of\nClothing and Gentlemen\'s Furnishings,\nflats and Gaps,\nhadies\', Misses\' and Childrenns Fine Footwear,\nMen\'s Boots and Shoes\nREGARDLESS OF QOST\nThis is no advertisemeat, Out a Cloelpg Out Male,\nas our outside busineu require our undivided\nattention, and we, are oolelled to give it our\nentire time, Your res eo lly,\nJOS.

The\nlargest claim for the mouth came from\nCuster county, $802 for 98 coyotes, 20\nwolves and 8 pups. The conuty of\nYellofstone came second with $258 for\n106 coyotes and 9 wolves. Ohotean\ncounty, which generally files the largest\namount, filed no claims at all. Granite\ndid not file any either. The working\nof the new uounty law is proving ,very\nsatisfactory to the number of animals\nkilled and in the lessened cost to the\nstate.\nTHOUGHT TO BE INSANE.\nA Sheepherder from Yellowstone County\nPicked Up In Butte.\nC. R. Nelson, a sheep herder, who\narrived in the city a few days ago from\nYellowstone county, was taken to the\ncity jail yesterday in a deplorable con\ndition mentally. Nelson has been\ndrinking heavily since he came to Butte\nand it is possible this is the cause of\nhis difficulty, but for the time being at\nleast his mirnd is badly deranged.\nWben taken to jail he imagined him\nself in the presence of President Mc\nKinley and Mark Hanna and conversed\nvolubly with them on the tariff on wool\nand other topics, addressing them in\nthe most familiar terms and telling\nthem what he expected of them with\nregard to a great many public ques\ntions. The officers are of the opinion\nthat drink is the chief cause of Nelson\'s\ncondition and that be will be all right\nwhen he gets sober. He will accord\ningly be held at the city jail till, he\nhas had time to recover from the effects\nof his dissipation, and should he then\ncontinue to show signs of insanity he\nwill be sent to the county jail for an\nexamination.', 'The Billings Gazette.\nSSBRI-IE\'BBKLY.\n12.

The object of the meeting is\nto fix the time and place for holding\nthe two state conventions-the one to\nelect delegates to the national conven.\ntion, and the one to nominate a state\nticket.\nBillings ought to have one of these\nconveUtionis, nun r1e Utazerre aeuire\nto call the attention of the committe\nto the fact that this city is ready nut\nanxious to entertain the delegates\nBillings is well equipped with hate\nfacilities, has a thel opera house for\nconvention hall, this city is probably\nmore talked about than any other towi\nin the state on account of its ramp\ngrowth and general prosperity, and thi\ndeleagtes, we believe, would prefer ti\nhave the regular state convention\nwhich will prbably convene in Augus\nor September, held in this city.\nBesides, eastern Montana, which it\nnaturally a republican stronghold, it\nentitled to the honor of entertaining r\nrepublican state convention, and wt\nassure the committee. if the claims of\nBillings are favorably considered, thai\nthe delegates will not regret their visil\nto this beautiful little city, nor will\nthe republican party suffer in conne.\nquence.\nIs I\'HACTIVALLY DEAD).\nA Washington dispatch published in\n,another column conveys the intelligence\nthat the Foster land leasing bill is\npractically dead, its author decldriung\nthat he will not push the measure if\nit meets with the opposition of the\npeople. It certainly does meet with\nthe opposition of the people of the en\ntire west, and remonstratlces by the\n:yarc, are said to be arriving in Wash.\nington by every mail, so it can be taken\nfor granted that the Foster bill is dis\nposed of.\nThe proposition to lease the public\nlands of the west, however, may come\nup in congress in another form, and it\nis well for the people to fill up the re.\nmonstraunces now being \'circulated and\nforward them to thitir representatives\nat Washington. There is to be a meet\ning of western governors at Salt Lake\nCity on the 18th of April, the object of\nwhich is to ask congress to transfer all\nunoccupied public land to the states in\nwhich it is located. At first glance,\nthis looks as if it would be a good\nthing for the west, but it has been in.\ntimated that the legislatures would\nlease the lands, if the various str.tes of\nthe west should acquire them, although\nif such a move were made it could be\ndealt with much more effectively than\na national movement, or a law enacted\nby congress in that direction,\nAt any rate, the people will be ulad\nto learn that the Foster bill is out of\nthe way and they will see to it that\nany kindred proporition meets with the\nsame fate if their protests will avail.\nTHAT IJVEx5TI(ATION.\nThe Clark senatorial inuvstigation is\nover, so far as the taking of testimony\nis concerned, anl tile state of Montanall\nis to be congratulated that the deimo.\norate, for the time being at least, are\nthrough washing their dirty linen arnd\nthrowing mud at each other down lit\nWashington. Through i doinocratic\ncorruption and this Clark-Daly feud,\nthe attention of the tntire United States\nhas been directed to Montana fur tile\npast forty days and the state halls uf.\nfered incalculable daunage in conse\nquence. From ocean to ocevlan and\nfrom the gulf to the lakes it is adver\ntised as the most rotten borough In the\nUnion.

MANTLE\'N INTERVIEW,\nIn ancther column of this issue wi\nrepublish a Washington special to the\nButte Inter Mountain, ex-Senator Let\nMantle\'s uewspaper, giving that usen\ntleman\'s views on the political stitn\ntion in this state, That he has eor,\nreetly sized it up there can be no doubt\n-couditions have changed since twc\nund four years ago, silver does not pos.\ntess the absorblup interest that it did\nin \'0(, the silver republicans and popu.\nlists will not fuse with the democrats\nbhis year, who will be driven from\npower in Montana, That is the sub.\nitance of Mr. Mantle\'s interview, ex.\niept that he also says that silver will\n,coupy a secondary place in the demo.\niratic national platform, and that free\noiounge, if separated from other vital\niuestious, would carry in this state.\nThe Anaconda Standard takes Mr.\nMantle\'s interview ams a text for a lead\nu. editorial, charging that he has de\nerted silver and that lie will this year\nat with the republicans, As to the\nIrat charge, it is well known that Mr,\ndantle left the republican party four\n\'ears ago solely on account of silver,\nut, now that the democrats are deter\nnined to relegate that issue to the rear,\nud will fight the coming campaign on\nplatform opposed to the interests ofat\nhe great west especially, and the\nwhole country in general, Mr. Mantle\n,nd all other honest silver republicans\nnust necessarily return to the republli\nan party. There is no other political\nefuge for them ; they were always re"\nublioans, except that they were for inu.\nependent free coinage at the ratio of\n6 to 1, but they have now learned that\nhe democrats were not sincere in their\ndvocaney of that issue.\nThe only wonder is that Mr. Mantle\nas been so long deceived by the dmoe.\nrats. Like most of the other silver re.\nublicans in Montana, he should have\naturned to his party in \'08, but in his\nuse it is better late than never, and\nthe republicanl of thin ntate will be\nglad to learn that he has at last re"\nturned to his first love.\nTHE HURNT OAME.\nC.

Land\nand Improvement Co.\nW. M. Johnston, acting ofity clerk,\nreceived a telegram last night from At.\ntorney M. B. Gunn of Helena, stating\nthat the city of Billings had won in the\ncase of the Minnesota & Montana Land\n& Improvement company against the\ncity of Billings and Yelldwstone county\nand W. B. George, county treasurer,\nbefore Judge Knowles. The case is a\ncelebrated one and was an nation\nbrought by the land company to prevent\nthe city from giving tax deeds to cer.\ntuin property belonging to the conl\nplaniant that had been sold for taxes.\nThe complainant owns about 2,000 lots\non the outskirts of Billings. In 1898\nthe city council passed an ordinance\ncreating special improvement district\nNo. 1, by which it was proposed to\nbuild two large drainage ditches. A\ntax of nearly $8 was imposed on the\nlots of the complainants. The com\nplainaut refused to pay the taxes, alleg\ning the action of the city was illegal.\nThe property was sold for taxes. Taxes\nand penalties amounted to about $8,"\n887.0(0. A decree was asked declaring\nthe tax invalid and for an injunction\nrestraining the issuance of deeds. The\nclaim was made that the city had not\nreciprocated; that properties adjoining\nbelonging to the railroad had not been\ntaxed.\nThe court decides that the cialty was\nlegally Incorporated, as it had been\nacting as a corporation, that the points\nraised by complainant were not well\ntaken. It was a complete victory for\nthe city. In concluding his opinion,\nthe court said:\n"After a full consideration of the\ncase it appears to me that the ditches\nor drains constructed by the defendant\ncity were public improvements and a\nbeneficial one to all the lot owners in\nthe said city; that there was no dis\norimination against the complainant in\nthe special tax assessed; that the tax\nupon its property was the same as that\nupon all of the lot owners within the\ncorporate limits of the said city in no.\ncordauce with the rules of law above\nexpressed. I think the prayer of com.\n,plainuant\'s bill should be denied and\nthat defendants should have judgment;\nthat complainant\'s bill be dismissed\nand for their costs in this case."\nTHE GRIEA\'IT\' "1FII)O1 A."\nTile MeDowell-Walsh Combllnltioll Will\nIP\',ellnt It Marchl J1.\nMemories of F~anny Davenport, who\ngave the American stage the plays of\nSardon, will be recalled on Wednesday\nMarch 21, inu the appearance of Mr. Mel.\nbourne Muocowell, who was her lead\ning man and husband, and iaN such was\nclosely identified with her best artistic\ntriumphs.

Tets.\nSpeooal work in the study of indi\nvidual children under the general title\nof "Child Study" has shown teachers\nand school patrons the great need of\nattention to the child\'s physical wel\nfare. Good health is of greater value\nthan schooling. All good teachers now\nrecognise this fact, and it has become\nan essential part of their work to pro.\nvide suitable hygienic conditions for\nthe children under their care.\nAmong other disabilities that the\nmodern teacher attempts to correct or\nprevent are those very subtle defects\npertaining to the eye and the ear.\nEvery teacher doing her full duty will\ngive each pupil the simple tests for\nsight or hearing, and if defects or weak\nnesses appear she will so arrange his\nplace in the school room that these\ndifaiulties may be overcome or alleviat\ned.\nThis matter of the child\'s physical\nwelfare has gone further than the mere\nprovince of the teacher. It has entered\nseriously into school architecture, and\nno modern school building is put up to\nday that does not provide abundance\nof light, coming from the right direc\ntion, avoiding crosslights, front lights\nor shadows. Even the proper tint of\nwindow shade is considered. Ventila\ntion must be sufficient and effective.\nDesks are provided according to the\nsize of the pupil and very many other\nitems are considered, about which the\naverage patron seldom thinks. School\nboards, too, give more attention to the\nphysical condition of the children of\nour schools than ever before. In some\nof the eastern cities of the United\nStates, and in many of the German and\nAustrian cities, expert physicians are\nengaged by school officers to make reg\nular examinations of the children\'s\nteeth, ears and eyes. The records of\nsuch examinations assist the teachers\nin properly placing defective children\nso as to give them the greatest possible\nassistance in the preparation of their\ndaily tasks.\nThe schools of our own city have\nbeen fortunate in receiving the gratui\ntous services of an expert occulist,\nrecently, by whom nearly four hundred\npupils were examined, and from whom\neach teacher has received a chart of her\npupil\'s eyes. These charts remain on\nfile and any parents who desire the\nrecord of their children\'s sight may\nhave the same for the asking. A sunm\nmary of these examinations shows some\ninteresting facts. Among 400 pupils of\nall ages the following numbers hold\nthe right eye differing from the left:\nIn astigmatism, sixty-six; in aching,\ntwo; in seeing at twenty feet distance,\nsixty-two; (refraction), 105., In the\nhigh school thirty-six students were ex\namined, mostly 15, 16 and 17 years of\nage. Of these twelve showed astigma\ntism in both eyes, In single eyes there\nwere nineteen cases of astigmatism.\nAstigmatism is easily understood by\nlooking at the face of a large clock.\nIf IX-III are blackest there is hor\nsontal astigmatism. If XII is blackest\nthere is vertical astigmatism. Twelve\nof these students complained of aobhing\neyes; fourteen had acute visions in\nboth eyes, nine in the right eye and\nten in the left; ten had good vision in\nboth eyes; seven, right; ten, left;\nvision not quite good-both, five; right,\nten; left, nine; sight poor-both, two;\nright, three; left, one;sight very poor\nboth, two; right, four; left, three.\nThe ophthalmoscope showed: Right\neye-normal, twenty-four; tendancy\ntowards farsightedness, five; towards\nnearsightedness, four. Left eye-nor\nraal, twenty-three; farsighted tendency.\neight; nearsighted tendency, two.\nIn grades three to eight, 250 pupils,\nages 9 to 15 years, were examined. Of\nthese thirty.three had horizontal astig\nmatism in both eyes; forty-seven had\nvertical in both. The right eye showed\nthirty-four horizontal, fifty-four verti\ncal. Left eye, thirty-four horizontal,\nforty-two vertical.\nBoth eyes and each eye separately\nshowed thirty-seven cases of slanting\nastigmatism. Fifty-nine grade pupils\ncomplained of aching eyes. The chart\ntest of vision at twenty feet showed\nAcaote, both, forty: right, twenty\nthree; left, twenty-two. Good, both,\n1l8; right, 116; left, 116.

The\neasons for this are that great difficulty\ncould be encountered in securing an\nntelligent and unprejudiced jury in\nhis county. The case has been so\nenerally a subject of conversation for\nighteen months past and the progress\nf the first trial was so closely followed\n,y all people that there are few intelli_\nent people but have formed an opinion,.\nJuder these circumstances it is gen.\nrally regarded as due both the prisoner\nud the state that the second trial be\neard in another county and though the\nxpenses of witnesses might be great, It\nrould entail no more expense upon\nrergus county than the summoning of\ngreat number of trial jurors. To\nbhat county the case will be assigned,\nhould the change of venue be granted,\ns a matter of speculation, though it Is\numored that Judge Leslie, of Great\ncalls, has expressed his willingness to\nconduct the trial.\nA FATHER IN JAIL.\nTerrible (Charge Made Against a Carbon\nCounty Raneher.\nIf the wife and daughter of Charles\nA.
