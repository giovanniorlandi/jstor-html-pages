""\nThe Eight-Hour Principle\nThe railroad employees were bent\nupon the extension of the eight-hour\nprinciple to their employment, not by\narbitrarily limiting the day\'s labor to\neight hours, which, owing to the nature\nof the employment might be often im\npracticable, but by granting the same\npay for eight hours as had been paid\nfor ten hours, or a hundred-mile run,\nand exacting a penalty of fifty per cent\nadditional for overtime. This demand\nwn in accord with the universal cus\ntom that where an industry was\nadapted to the eight-hour principle, it\nwas without diminution of the days\nwage, the argirrfl\'eut being that in\ncreased cllieieney would make up the\ndifference.

During\nthe three fiscal years ended June 30, 1916, gold imports were 733 millions\nof dollars, exports 348 millions, showing a net gain of 385 millions. This\nis more than 10 times the net gain in gold imports during the preceed\ning three years. No such increase in the stock of gold was ever re\ncorded before.. Still more significant is it that this net gain all came\nduring the last fiscal year, and still continues.\nYet more astounding is it that our merchandise exports for the past\nthree years exceeded imports by the stupendous total of 3,700 millions\nof dollars. This is nearly two and a half times as much as during trie\nearlier three-year iperiod. How have these excessive exports been paid\nfor? \'The gold imports have paid for scarcely one-eighth of this in\ncrease, leaving a balance in favor of this country of 2,700 millions of\ndollars. Part of this lias been paid by the return to this \'country of\nAmerican securities, but millions of it must still be owed by individuals,\ncorporations and governments abroad to Americans here.\nNo wonder that many economists look for a continued period of\nindustrial activity, redundant money at lower rates, with commodity\nprices and wages to correspond, for some years to come. But tlie ques\ntion is, how can our farmers and manufacturers meet the competition in\nthe world\'s markets of the now warring nations when, again they arc\nat peace, and bending all their efforts to undersell us, so as to earn some\ntiling to make up their losses and pay their debts? Xo mind can fathom\nthe probable future, because of these and many other conditions, which\nare utterly without precedent. Orange Judd Farmer, Springfield, Mass\n00\nSAM PLATT\nSam Tlatt is the main owner of the Reno Evening Gazette. Here\nis what was said in that paper concerning the Pittman Land bill and\nits benefit to the public schools and university on Tuesday, March 28,\n1916, as taken from an editorial in that issue:\n"As long as the attacks on the president of the state university\nwere confined to two papers and the animus of both was well known\nto be nothing more than personal dislike, the Gazette thought it unnec\nessary to discuss the subject. - "\n"The president of the university is m Washington, D. C, because\na matter of greatest importance to the university called him there. The\nuniversity is a government-aided institution, the United \'States has an\ninterest in it; it is broader than Nevada and the ipeople of this state\nought to know those facts. Without discussing procedure prescribed\nin the land bill now before congress, which was introduced by the\njunior senator at the request of the state legislature, the fact remains\nthat this state has never received from the United States the area of\npublic land to which Nevada is entitled. Washington. Oregon, Califor\nnia, Montana, Colorado have all received land grants, making the small\ngrant to Nevada look insignificant, indeed. The school system of Ne\nvada, the University of Nevada, as the head of that school system, every\neducational institution of the state, ought to be receiving income from\nthe sale of lands that properly belong to the state.\n"If Editor Buck will investigate as the Gazette has investigated we\nfeel that he, too, will lose patience over the petty, narrow-minded nag\nging at the university and its president, in which some of the state pa\npers a very few, indeed are indulging."\nHere we have Mr. Piatt\'s endorsement of the purpose of the Pitt\nman bill in March. Today he is beating the beautiful atmosphere of\nNevada with uplifted hands and declaring the government alone should\nhandle the state of Nevada. The Gazette editorial proves one thing,\nhowever, that the ever-blooming and evergreen candidate has lucid\nintervals.\nThe Pittman bill, as its merits become known to the people, will\nreceive hearty support. The people are believers in the best schools\nand also believers in the idea that Nevada, as well as other states, sTiould\nhave its schools supported-by the sale of land grantedl to the state \'by\nthe government. The bill has been maligned, lied about, misinterpreted\nand misquoted so often that when the real truth becomes known it will\nbe regarded as one of the most beneficial bills ever introduced in behalf\nof the state of Nevada.\noo\nMR. WILSON A STEADY FIGHTER\nMr.- Wilson\'s experience in having arrayed against him the more\narrogant influences of the country is not a new one for presidents who\nare worth while.\n"Life" quotes Miss Tarbell as saying:\n"Jefferson fought the Federalists, including most of the . rich and\nrespectable people in the country; Jackson fought the United States\nhank; Lincoln fought the slave-holding aristocracy and all its allies;\nRoosevelt fought here and there the trusts, the railroads, the bankers\noff and on, but Roosevelt is an aristocrat and has compassionate bow\nels for his own kind.\n"But Mr. Wilson 13 not an aristocrat He has fought, according to\nhis lights, against the exploitation of the bodies and energies of the\ncommon people to defend the interests and investments of the pros\nperous. At the start he would not fight in Mexico to defend American,\n-investors; he would not take sides with Rockefeller in the Colorado\n3trike; he helped reduce the tariff; he alleviated the domination of the\nmoney trust; he would not get us into the war, even after the Lusitama,\nthough lit did risk doing so, and though all \'society\' wanted to get m;\nand he would not side with the railroads against the brotherhoods.\n"This man is for the mass of the people. He really is a great\ndemocrat. He is a good hand to nip the tariff cobra, the banking adder,\nthe railroad boa constrictor when that is necessary. It is his nature to.\nfight these creatures. ..It "was not Roosevelt\'s nature to fight them. He\ncould slash around among theni on occasion, but he enjoyed their\nsociety. His notion of - government was always government by aris\ntocracy." s\nHAD NEVER READ BILL\nBefore speaking for or against a measure wouldn\'t it be a good Idea\nto at ieast read it? Miss Caroline Lowe is speaking throughout the state\nagainst Senator Pittman and his land grant bill,, but admitted at Millers\nlast week that she had never read it.\n-00-\nA SENSIBLE WOMAN\'S VIEWS\nMrs. E. K. Foster, president of the Friday Morning club, Loj\nAngeles, has the following to say . regarding President Wilson and the\nHughes "Special": "Because of the international difficulties which have\nbeen presented to our president, he is deserving of the greatest apprec\niation and loyal support. The child labor bill alone should prompt every"\nwoman to .support him. The tragic picture of prominent social workers\ntraversing the country in a Hughes special under the guise of working\nfor suffrage merits only the opposition of every loyal suffragist."\n00\n"ONCEOVERS"\nWhen you hear a man comiplaining of favoritism shown the one\nhigher up and commenting on what he terms the man\'s ability to hold\nthe job which "he had gotten on a pull," you will find by observation\nthat the complaining one does not have his mind on his own work and\nis a "clock watcher," a poor investment for any employer.\nFew men in the commercial world hold positions on "pull."\nThe race in .the business world is too strenuous to permit any em\nployer to Qarry "deadwood." He is after "live wires."\nIf you are the under man, look for the reason.\nIf you are honest in your search you will find the why of it.\nYou may be superior to that other man;, except in one particular,\nand that particular thing may be more important to your employer than\nanything else you have to offset :t.\nFind out where that man excels you, and then perfect yourself so\nthat neither he nor anyone else can have anything on you. The man\nwho can compete in every particular wins out every time.\nBe an all-round star in jour work, and thenyu will be a favorite,\nand descive it, too.\n00\nWEST IS REAL LAND OF OPPORTUNITY\nThe death of Henry Miller once more calls to attention the match\nless advantages and opportunities of California and the Pacific West.\nHere was a man, who as a lad, came to this country a stranger with\na stranger tongue. He had been reared as a butcher\'s apprentice, with\nthe limited education of such a trade, and he came to California with\nnothing but his brains and his hands to give him a start.\nHe began here as a butcher boy, and he died the possessor of lands\nthat in acreage are said to twice exceed the entire area of Belgium. Tie\nwas industrious, sober, and far-seeing. But with all these, had it not\nbeen for the splendid opportunities of the land he chose for his home\nhe never could have achieved and such distinction or accumulated any\nsuch fortune.\nAnd simjlar opportunities for success and achievement lie close\nabout us in California at this day. There is many a poor lad here now,\nwhen he comes to lay aside his life fifty years from today, will have\nmade a name and a fortune greater than Henry Miller. The fields and\nhills of opportunity have hardly been scratched in Imperial California\nand her sister states of the great Pacific Coast. S. F. Examiner.\n00\nVOTE OF COMPLETE CONFIDENCE\nThe result of the deliberations of the respective legislatures of St.\nThomas and St. Croix on the question of Denmark\'s sale of the Islands\nto the United States would in itself be credit enough to the charac\nter of this Nation, but the manner in which this result has been mani\nfested thus far is to be taken as indicating the complete confidence of the\nDanish West Indian islanders that the change of possession and alle\ngiance will redound to their good.\nBoth representative bodies, it appears, have designated delegates to\npresent personally to the Parliament in Copenhagen their instructions of\nrecommendation of transfer; but, which is more, St. Croix\'c have been\n"told to recommend reforms" to the home -government in connection\nwith the terms of the transfer. In other ways, more or less formal, the\ninsular governments have acquainted Copenhagen with their approval\nof the American purchase proposal, and it is not doubted that an immi\nnent popular assembly in St. Thomas will bear out the decision of its\nlegislature.-\nIf the Danish power is not sure of itself in the matter, the islanders\narc setting an example of assurance on the part of those most concerned:\na situation that will make its impression in both countries that are\nparties principal to the proposed deal, and one that should certainly\nsimplify the United States plans for assimilating the people of these valu\nable possession into its .political aiid social scheme.\n00\nEdwin E. Caine and J. G. Sanders have made a compete canvass of\nClark and Lincoln counties speaking in all the large towns and at Good\nsprings. Searchlight and Elderado Canyon. They found no sentiment\nwhatever favorable to Mr. Hughes and very little for any but the can\ndidates on the Democratic ticket. Those best posted claim that both\ncounties will increase their democratic majorities very materially this\nyear.\n00\nEvidence is accumulating that the cattlemen of the state, are furnish\ning funds to defeat the Pittman "Land Grant bill. The bill would take\nfrom them millions of acres of range that they now have the free use of.\nThey have furnished, it is said, nearly all the funds to back the Platt-Miller-Kilborri\nattacks on the land bill. They care not who is elected\nif they can kill the land grant and keep the free range.\n00 r\nThe Republican state platform endorsed the land grant for school\npurposes; Congressman Roberts endorsed the Pittman Land Grant Bill\nbefore the committee at Washington; the Reno Gazette editorially en\ndorsed the land grant as proposed by the Pittman bill. We would sug\ngest that Mr. Tlatt get in line with his political partner, his own paiper,\nand the platform of his party. \' "\n00\nIf there is one enterprise on earth that a "quitter" should leave\nseverely alone it is advertising.

With a view to pre\nventing the strike he proposed legisla\ntion giving the men their contention\nwithout the overtime penalty during a\nperiod of government investigation,\nlasting between six and nine mouths,\nin which all the questions relating to\nwages and time were to be considered.\nWith reference to the adjustment of\nthe additional cost of operation as\nbetween the railway stockholders and\nthe shippers, he proposed an investiga\ntion and decision by the Interstate\nCommerce Commission". With reference\nto guarding against future emergencies\nof a similar nature the President pro\nposed v legislation preventing, in such\ncases, either strikes or lockouts pend\ning a government investigation by a\ntribunal organized for the purpose of\nascertainment and publication of the\nfacts, and also legislation giving the\nPresident the power in case of military\nnecessity to take possession of and\noperate the trains.\nProposal Fair to All Parties\nIn this way the President sought to\nbe fair to all parties, the railway em\nployeet, the railway operators and\ninvestors, and the shippers and general\npublic. \'The President\'s proposal was a\nconnected scheme of legislation which\nought to have been adopted as an\nentirety. As such I supported it\nearnestly, said Mr. Newlands, but 1\nwas unable to persuade either the Sen\nate Committee on Interstate Commerce,\nof which I was chairman, or the Sen\nate to consider any of the President\'s\nproposals except, the one favorable to\nthe brotherhoods as to ten hours\' pay\nfor eight hours\' work and the investi\ngation of its effects. All other legisla\ntion was postponed to the future.\nThe President Brave Congress\nCowardly\nIn all this contention, continued Mr.\nXewlamfe, the President was brave and\nCongress cowardly. The President\nsought to cover immediately every\nphase of the question by adequate legis\nlation. Congress postponed the con\nsideration of the most of his recom\nmendations to a time which may never\ncome, if apathy again controls. But\nwe may be assured that the President\nwill push all his recommendations at\nthe next session. The fault of failure\nof legislation as to these important mat\nters rests with Congress, not the Presi\ndent, and in the Congress the Republi\ncans were equally at fault with the\nDemocrats. As an instance of this the\nSpeaker said that when he introduced,\nin June last, long before the strike was\nordered, a resolution in the Senate for\nthe investigation by the Interstate\nCommerce Commission of all the con\nditions relating to the hours and wages\nof all railway\' employees, including\nthose outside of the railway brother\nhoods, the resolution was laid on the\ntable on the motion of a prominent\nRepublican Senator.\nReason, Not Force\nIn all matters, therefore, said Mr.\nNewlands, relating to war, whether the\nwar in Europe, the civil war in Mexico\nor the threatened industrial war in\nthe United States, the President had\nstood by the civilized policy of substi\ntuting reason for force, and under most\ntrying and contradictory circumstan\nces, amidst public clamor and criticism,\nhad pursued as consistent a course as\nwas possible under constantly chang\ning conditions.\nPROFESSIONAL\nDR.

EDISON.\nbelieve there was ever a president\nwho had as many big questions to\ndecide. They have come in bunches.\nHe hasn\'t always pleased me, just as\nI suppose he hasn\'t always pleased\nother people. I"if when yon look the\n, record over, it\'s so good that criticism\n! comes close to being nothing more\nthan cheap fault finding.\n"A fool or a coward would have had\nthe United States in all sorts of\ntrouble. As it is, we are at peace, the\ncountry was never more prosperous,\nand we have the strength that comes\nwith honor and integrity of purpose.\n"Had we recognized Huerta, it\nwould have served notice upon the\nworld that the United States, while\nbelieving In democracy for home use,\nwas willing to stand for despotism\nwhere other peoples were concerned.\nPresident Wilson\'s Mexican policy has\nbeen wise and just and courageous.\n"Belgium? Hindsight! In the light\nof two years, it\'s easy to say what\nshould have been done. But at the\ntime, not a single paper or a public\nman even thought of anything but\nkeeping the United States out of the\nEuropean horror.\n"As I said at the start, it has just\nbeen one big thing after another with\nWilson. I never have known so many\ndangerous questions brought up for de- !\ncision to any one President. I\n"Look at the threatened general rail-\nroad strike. If carried through, such j\na strike would have thrown the whole I\ncountry into confusion.\n"In my opinion, Mr. Hughes, if\nPresident, would have found it difficult\nto decide on the best course for the\nGovernment to take in such matters. !\nHis capacity for hindsight, as we learn\nfrom his speeches, is highly developed,\nbut as to his foresight, we are not\nequally well informed.\n"They say Wilson has blundered.\nPerhaps he has. But I notice that he\nusually blunders forward.\n"Mr. Wilson now has had about four\nyears of experience, and I think that\nhe has earned faith and trust. I do\nnot think it a sensible thing to change\nto an inexperienced and untried man\nTherefore, I en for Woodrow\nWilson."\nCarson Valley Bank\nCarson City\nNevada\ni\'\n!\nCapital, hilly paid .\nOFFICERS\nGe .
