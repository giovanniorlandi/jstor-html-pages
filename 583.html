Ingaining\nadmission into the Southern As\nsociation the College far exceeded\nthe minimum standards set by the\nbody.\nI\nThis accomplishment is recog\nnized as a significant step toward\nthe ultimate goad.\nIn connection with *}ie inspec\ntion of the institution, special ac-j\ncomplements of the College were\nnoted. There exists a most modern\nphysical plant, which is valued at\nmore than $3,000,000 with ade-,\nquately equipped laboratories. The\nAdministrative organization is of\na university type and curricular\nofferings have been geatly ex\npanded and enriched.

W.j\nHill, veteran among Mississippi\nDentists in a holiday statement\nhere last week praised the era\nof dnterracial goodwill Existing\nin Clarksdale and Coahoma Coun\nty during the year of 1946.\nThe statement of Dr. Hill was\nwidely published in the leading\ndailies of the Mississippi Delta.\nThe statement made by Dr. Hill\nis as follows: “Within the next\nfew days will the last chapter in |\nthe year of nineteen hundred and j\nforty six be closed. To thos who;\nJ will be interested to reflect for a |\n1 moment, I am sure that we cannot j\nbut decide within our minds, that j\nwe havt many thingsn for which J\nto be thankful. Doubtless manyj\nof us made some resolutions at j\nthe beginning of this year that j\nwe hoped to accomplish during j\nthe year. If you have succeeded in ;\nrealizing the desires of your won\nhearts certainly 1 reoice with you, j\nbut if you have failed it might be i\nwise to check up and take stock\nof your activities and try to find j\ntne cause, ana enaeavor to ao\nbetter next time. lie nol discour\naged but rather be thankful for\nthat which you have^ realizing\nthe fact: ‘‘The Darkest is Just\nBefore Dawn.” In so far as I have\nbeen able to learn the city of\nClarksdale and Coahoma County\nhave enjoyed immensely an Era\nof Good Feeling all during the\nyear of Nineteen Hundred and\nForty Six. As proof of this evye\nrcitizen of this community both\nwhite and colered seem to have\nbeen contented to remain at his\nor her post of duty ever mindful\nof our thoughts and actions which\nhave been the means of keeping\nour tongues from guild and our\nhearts in a receptive mood. Not\nwithstanding the great changes\nthat the world is undergoing and\nthe South in particular, it seems\nthat the good neighbor policy is\nforever uppermost in the minds of\nthe majority of citizens in this\nsection of the State. Of the many\nflurries of recent violence that\nhave taken place in the various\nsections of our state as an after\nmath of sundry causes, we as\ngood citizens of this section of\nMisissippi, rejoice to know that\nan Era of Good Feeling still lin\ngers amongus. I am almost sure\nthat it is because of the great\nChristian respect and kind con\nsideration that the majority of\nour citizens hav<? for the rights\nof minority groups. None of us\nare at this time enveloped in in\nvestigations of any nature present\nnor urior to this, but instead we\nare all at home with our loved\nones and friends, making ready\nfor the Yuletide celebration of\nNineteen Hundred and Forty Six.\nFor the most part our understand\nings have been mutual, and if\nthere are any exceptions, they\nwere soon ironed out to the entire\nsatisfaction of all concerned. Less\nwe forget, I hope that we wont '\nbecome too contented with our!\npresent status of affairs yet, for\nthere is much progress to be\nmade, if we would dlesire to main\ntain an Era of Good Feeling a\nmong all our citizens of Clarks\ndale and Coahoma County. Now\nI am almost sure that I voice the\nsentiments o fthe majority of col\nored citizens of Coahoma County\nwhen I say that we believe that\nwe are living in a County un ex\ncelled by any in the State of Miss\nissippi, and for all of which; do\nwe feel very grateful indeed. May\nI wish for you one and all a ve(*y\nMerry Christmas and a Happy\nNew Year,”\nA CHRISTMAS PROCLAMATION\nit At the Christmas season, when many hearts thrill once more over the revelation of God's\nlove for all men and his desire that they shall live together in peace, the undersigned White\nresidents of Jackson would like to convey to the Colored population of Jackson our sincere ex\npression and assurance of good will and interest.\nit We deplore the activities of persons and organizations which, in unkind word or unfair\ndeed or unchristian attitude, cause ill will, suspicion, fear, or distrust between the two races.\nit We believe that the Negro should receive honest and fair treatment, with special refer\nence to education, government, housing and labor.

Al\nready he has grossed nearly $7,\n000, according to a report received\nby the U. S. Department of Ag\nriculture from the Arkansas State\nExtension Service.\nThe Ex-GI started out during\nthe fall of 1945 with 200 chackens\nand 50 rabbits, says H. C. Ray,\nNegro district Extension Agent, j\nHe housed them in improvised\nshelters and raised them in time'\nfor the Christmas market. They j\nbrought a fair margin of profit.!\nThis encouraged him to increase j\nhis flock and add more rabbits, j\nWith the aid of his county agent, j\nthe veteran planned and built a\nlarge poulry house, a brooder\nhouse, and a score of rabbit pens.\nThis fall, by the time he had\nbeen home a year, he had sold\nover 4,000 chickens and nearly\n1,000 rabbits. His fryers brought\nhim about a dollar each and his j\nrabbits $1.50 plus $1-75 for the\nhides when he cured them prop\nerly. He raises 1,000 chickens\nand 250 rabbits at a time.\nDistrict Agent Ray says that\nalthough Mr and Mrs. Wilson’s\nfarm contains only 10 acres, they\nare making it yield a good living.\nThey have a comfortable home\nwith electricity and running wa\nter. Next year they plan to in\ncrease their income by growing1\nmore of the feed for rabbits and\nchickens.\nSupreme Court\nDeclines Review of\nPoll-Tax Law\nWashington, D. C.

Hicks\nNNPA Staff Writer\nWashington, D. C., Dec. NNPA\n—The Veterans Administration is\nsuppressing the report on an in\nvestigation into charges of irregu\nlarities at its veterans’ hospital\nat Tuskegee, Alabama, it was\nlearned here last Monday..\nSuppression of thc^ report\nthreatened to involve the agenccy\nin a lawsuit when Leon A. Ran\nsom, attorney for Harold A. Gad\nsen, former utility trainee officer\nat Tuskegee, who informally has\nbrought the charges against the\nhospital said if the VA continued\nto refuse to make the report pub\nlic he would be forced to “take\nsuch legal steps as are necessary\nto ascertain what the investiga\ntion shows.”\n|\nIt was learned that early in\nJanuary, Mr. Godson, who was!\nemployed by the VA in Washing\nton, was sent to the Tuskegee\nhospital as a trainee for the job\nof utility officer there.\nIn April, it was learned, Mr.\nGadsen left Tuskegee and made\na trip to VA headquarters here\nwhere he informed top VA offic\nials that all was not well at Tus\nkegee. Mr. Gadsen, it was learned,\nwas careful not to make specifio\ncharges against any official at the\nhospital but urged an investigation\nby top VA officials.\nUpon his return to Tuskegee,\nMr. Gadsen was permitted to re\nsume his duties for a short time\nand then was fired. The reasons\ngiven for dismisal were that he\nwas incompetent and inefficient.\nHe then returned to Washing\nton and indicated to VO officials\nhere that his dismissal was a re\nsult of information-he had given\nthe agency on his previous trip\nto Washington.\nOn August 14, Mr. Gadsen was\ngiven a hearing at VA headquar\nters where he aired all his com\nplaints against the hospital. The\nhoard which conducted the hear\nings recommended that his dis\nmissal at Tuskegee he sustained,\nbut that he be offered another\njob with the VA in Washington.\nAt Tuskegee, Mr. Gadsen was\nclassed at a P-9, a job paying ap\nproximately 84,000 a year, which\ncorresponds with a CAF 7 posi\ntion in the non-professional\ngrades. He was offered a CAF-4\n(clerical) job in 'the VA head\nquarters here. He refused the offer\nand retained Mr. Ransom as his\nattorney.\nThe report of the investigation\nis now on the desk of R. G- Beers,\npersonnel! *relartions director at\nthe AV’s headquarters. The agen\ncy said last Monday it would not\nrepone the case of Mr. Gadsen\nuntil formal charges against the\nVA or someone in the agency\nwere brought by Mr. Gadsen\nthrough his attorney.\nby both mnjer political parties,1\nand do so i nthe spirit in which\nthey} have been understood by I\nmembers of minority groups, by\norganized labor., by the church\ngroups and by the public gener\nally.

You wall find it to be\na joy and blessing to you, not only\nas you study it by yourself, but also\nin the fellowship of those in the Sun\nday school and church.\nOur lessons for the next three\nmonths are of unusual interest, for\nthey take up the Gospel of John\nwhich wras “written, that ye might\nbelieve that Jesus is the Christ, the\nSon of God; and that believing ye\nmight have life through his name”\n(John 20:31).\nJesus Christ is here presented as\nthe Word (Logos), and he is indeed\nthe living Word come to reveal\nGod to us.\nI. The Living Word Is the Light\nof Men (vv. 1-5).\nMen ask questions about Christ.\nThey want to know whether he is\nto be regarded as a good man and\na great leader, or must we recog\nnize him as being God?\nThe answer is here. He was\nin the beginning (Gen. 1:1), which\nmeans that he pre-existed from all\neternity, and he “was God" even\nas he was “with God.” This eter\nnal, living, divine Word was the “ex\npress image” of God (Heb. 1:3), and\nso perfectly revealed the Father (v.\n18).\nHe is the Creator (v. 3) and giver\nof life both natural and spiritual.\nThis eternal Word became (as he\nWas) the light of men. He came to\nshine into the darkness of a sinful\nworld with the only light of redemp\ntion. We say again, “This is the \\\nLord!”\nII. The Living Word Is a Divider\nof Men (vv. 6-13).\nThe darkness of sin was so deep,\nand still is so deep that the glorious ;\nlight of God is not received with\ngladness, nor accepted at all. We\nsee that in the close of verse 5.\nNow the question comes. Does it\nmake any difference how a man\nregards Jesus Christ?\nThe answer is clear. You must\ndecide what you will do with him.\nYou cannot avoid that decision or\nevade that light which shines. You\nmust either accept or reject, and a\nfailure to accept is a rejection.\nGod has witnesses to the Light.\nJohn was such a witness and he,\nlike all true witnesses for Christ,\ndirected attention to him. John’s\ngreat testimony was just a lesser\nlight to point men to the true Light.\nThat true Light is shed abroad fer\nall men (v. 9).\nAs they face Christ, men divide\ninto two groups. His own people,\nand his own creation rejected him\nwhen he came (v. 11). How utterly\ntragic! And yet the same thing\ngoes on today. Men hear the gos\npel, are made acquainted with\nChrist and his claims, yet fail to\naccgpt his proffered salvation, and\nare eternally lost (John 3:19; Eph.\n2:1).\nBut, thank God, there are those\nwho receive him (v. 12), and to\nthem he gives the power, the right\nor authority, to be the sons of God.\nThis change is expressly declared\nto be (1) not by reason of family\nor heredity—“not of blood”; (2) not\nby natural instinct or development\n—not “of the will of the flesh”; and\n(3) not by human volition or by\nman’s will power—not “of the will\nof man.”\nIII. The Living Word Is a Re\nvealer of God (vv. 14-18).\nThe eternal Word, the Lord Jesus\nChrist, laid aside his place of honor\nin heaven, came to earth and took\nupon himself our flesh that he might\nredeem us from sin. What infinite\ncondescension, what unfathomable\nlove!\nHe dwelt among men and showed\nforth the grace and truth of God,\nfor he was full of these heavenly\nattributes. But it was in his giving\nof himself as Redeemer and Sa\nviour of mankind that he fully re\nvealed God in all his gracious love\nfor us.\nNotice the antithesis here. “Law”\nis set over against “grace”; “giv\nen” stands in contrast with “came,”\nand “Moses” with “Jesus Christ”\nThe law was a schoolmaster tc\nbring us to Christ (Gal. 3:24), but\nit could not save anyone; but grace\n—oh, it is by grace that we are\nsaved (Eph. 2:8).\n1 Moses was God’s honored servant,\nbut Jesus was the Son in the house\nhold (Heb. 3:5, 6). It was this Son\nof God who came to reveal the Fa\nther and to declare his grace in sal\nvation.\nThe law was sent through a mes\nsenger, but no messenger, no mat\nter how great or worthy, would do\nto bring the gospel of the grace of\nGod. That message of “grace and\ntruth came by Jesus Christ” (v. 17)\nEDITORIAL .. Public Opinion\nOne of the most important\n\'sources from which to judge the\ntrends and tides of public opinion\nis the letters to the editor, a de\npartment which has been develop\ned and which has become of vast\nimportance to the leading news\npapers and magazines throughout\nthe country. Letters to the edi\ntor are often the fore-runners of\nwhat eventually becomes the pre\nvailing public opinion.\nOne of the most significant let\ntres to the editor which we have\nobserved of late, was published\nrecently in the Clarion Ledger\nunder the caption, “Voice of The\nPeople”. The letter signed by\nRobert L. McClendon of Vossburg,\nMississippi, is as follows: Edi\ntor. The Jackson Clarion Ledger:\nWill you please publish this let\nter?\nLaw enforcement has failed\ndown here. We have plenty of\nlaws and plenty of public officers\nand plenty of witnesses to crime\nand open debuchery but little or\nno law enforcement. It would be\nfar better for the courts to close\nthan to advertise its donothing be\nfore the people. It has dwindled\ndown to divisions, or to two\nforces, and that is, the force of\ncrime carried on without restraint\nand the force of right doing car\nried on by the few and far scat\ntered citizens.\nInstead of things getting bet\nter they are weekly and monthly\ngrowing worse. As it exists to\nday the force for crime is grow\ning wrose. As it exists today the\nforce for crime is growing strong\ner by leaps and bounds. The few\nrighteous living people are too\nfew and too far apart to ever\nchange up this part of Mississippi\nlor a better social existence.\nI beg to offer, and join in the\nmove to appeal to the conscience\nof the crime breeders and crime\npertetrators to change up their\nwicked, inifluituous and destruc\ntive way and to this end I ask\nthat ten of the Christen men of\nwealth who live in Jackson, Mis\nsissippi, and in Meridian, Missis\nsippi and Laurel join me in an j\nleeven man move off to load up\na truck with us and with some j\nfood ready prepared to eat while !\nwe are out in the interrior appeal\ning to the multitude to change\ntheir course and doing and help\nthe law abiding people of this\nState to redeem itself from its\nswiftly distructive course.

The letter signed by\nRobert L. McClendon of Vossburg,\nMississippi, is as follows: Editor;\nThe Jacksan Clarion Ledger: Will\n(you please publish this letter?\nLaw enforcement has failed\ndown here. We have plenty of\nlaws and plenty of public officers\nand plenty of witnesses to crime\nand open debauchery but little or\nno law enforcement.

It has dwin\ndled dowm to divisions, or to two\nforces, and that is, the force of\ncrime carried on without restraint\nand the force of right doing car\nried on by the few and far scat\ntered citizens.\nInstead of things getting better\nthey are weekly and monthly\ngrowing worse. As it exists today\nthe force for crime is growing\nstronger and stronger by leaps\nand bounds.

Since\nfinances are low it would be a\ngood thing to give a major as\nsignment in academic teaching\nand a minor coaching job to some\nof these splendid track or field\nstars the bigger colleges turn out\neach year. Also our high school\nand college coaches could profit by\ntaking major courses in track and\nfield athletics in the many good\nsummer schools.\nOf course, this weakness in col\nlege sports is but a reflection of\nweakness in some of the other\ndepartments of colored college\neducation. But let us pick up in\nsome of the other experience\nfields hf college life while we are\nextending our curricula offerings\nin the other fields.\nas you can for as little as you can,\ninstead of human beings who can\nbe rooted, guided and given a pay\ning stake in an enterprising free\nenterprise. The latter will give\nbig business and industry a soul,\nand with such it will be able to\n! compete, on the basis of perform\nance, with communism, because it\ncan thusly lead the way in pro\nviding men and women of industry\nand character opportunity to build\nfor themselves a freer, richer, and\nfuller life.\nIt may be well that big busi\nnesses think in terms of making\nit possible for employees to share\nin profits and losses by making\nit possible for them to invest in\nthe concerns in which they are\nemployed. Employees should be\ngiven some of the responsibility\nof their employing concerns suc\ncesses. If free enterprise is to\nbe saved, it must absorb employ\nees and John Q. Public so as to\n1 make them a part of the warp\nI and loof of its fabric in order\nthat these two forces will fight\nfor its survival as a saint fights\nfor his faith.\nLabor will in 1947 do well to\nrecognize that its greatest dan\n1 ger lies in the possibility of its\nfailure to recognize and assume\nsocial responsibilities in a far\ngreater degree than industry as a\nwhole has ever dreamed of assum\ning. Labor must not aid, abet and\n[ allow itself to be absorbed into\nmovements designed to make pos\nsible race or religious discrimina\ntion or segregation of workers.\nLiving and working for the great\nest good for the greatest number\nof people is a law neither labor\nor capital can violate without at\nthe same time blacking out enter\nprising free enterprise and there\nby providing fertile soil in which\nthe seeds of fascism and commun\nism or some other half-breed doc\ntrines or clash-producing ideol\nogy may be sown.\nIndustry ought to be given the\nopportunity to provide the jobs\nneeded by every able bodied man\nand woman in these United States\nBlue Moon Inn\n★\nCOLD DRINKS - BEER\nSANDWICHES\n★\n181 Bell St.\nNancy Watson, Prop.\nH.

He em\nphasized that while the League\nof Nations had no policing force,\nthe UN in its first year has al\nready made provisions for an in\nternational army.\nMr. Tesemma was reluctant to\ncomment on the trusteeship of\nEritrea proposed by the Council j\nof Foreign Ministers, nor would\nhe state whether he considered\nthe $35,000,000 reparations which\nItaly must pay his country suf\nficient for the ravages done to\nEthopia by the Italians.\nMr. Tesemma said his country\nwas in the unique position or\nhaving an abundance of gold but\nvery little money. He explained\nthat what Ethopia needs is not\ngold but dollar purchasing power\nin the United States. He said that\nEthopia could not profit by sell-1\ning her gold to the United States,\ndue to the low cost of gold here,;\nbut that she could sell it ao a\nprofit to other countries.\nSales to other countries, how\never, still leeave Ethopia without\ndollars to buy needed American\ngoods, he emphasized.\nMr. Tesemma said Ethopia has\nno fear of exploitation by the\nAmerican interests which have re\ncently been granted concessions\nYellow Jackets !\nEnd Successful\nSeason\nThe Corinth Colored High\nSchool Yellowjackets ended one of\ntheir fost successful seasons when\nthey defeated the strong Tupelo\nBlue Devils 13-0.

C. — A large\nnumber of bills designed chiefly\nto protect the rights of minority\ngroups is expected to jam the\nlegislative hopper when the Eight\nieth Congress convenes January 3\nAs a condition precedent to en\nactment of any such measures,\namendmen of the Senate cloture\nrule to prevent unlimited debate\nappears necessary in the light of\nthe filibusters which blocked pas\nsage of fair employment practice\nand anti-poll tav legislation in the\nlast Congress.\nThe need for a change in the\npresent Senate cloture rule is em\nphasized by the fact that Republi\ncan Senators fear a Southern\nDemocratic filibuster which would\nblock organization of the Senate\nfor weeks if an effort is made to\nkeep Senator Theodore G- Bilbo\nfrom taking his seat on January\n3 on the ground that his intimida\ntion of colored voters rendered his\nelection void.\nUnder the present rule, cloture\ncan be invoked only after a mo\ntion, signed by sixteen Senators,\nis adopted by a two-thirds vote\non any calendar day following its\npresentation.\nThe futility of this rlue was\namply demonstrated during the\nlast session when Southern Demo\ncratic Senators wrould not even\npermit the presentation of a mo\ntion to limit debate until there\nwas a behind-closed-doors parley\nbetween their representative, Sen\nator Richard B. Russell, of Geor\ngia, and Senator Alben W. Bark\nley, of Kentucky, the Democratic j\nLeader, and Senator Robert A. i\nTaft, of Ohio, chairman of the\nRepubliacn Steering Committee.\nSouthern Democrats blocked all\nconsideration of the bill for twen\nty-three days and tied the Sen\nate into a parliamentary snarl af\nter Senator Kenneth McKellar,\nDemocrat, of Tennessee, the Sen\nate’s presiding officer, had ruled\nthat a petition to limit debate\ncould not be presented so long as\nthe Senate technically was in the\nprocess of correcting its minutes\nof January 17.\nThe record on cloture shows\nthat in only four of twenty-four\ninstances has the rule to limit\ndebate been invoked since it was\nadopted in 1917.\n•\nIf the cloture rule is changed to\nmake possible the limiting of de\nbate whenever a majority of the\nSenate desires to bring any pend\ning measure to a vote, minority\ngroups may then look forward\nto legislation dealing with the\nprotection of civil rights, anti\nlynching, fair employment prac\ntice and anti-poll tax.\nFor sometime Attorney General\nTom C. Clark has been waging\na campaign to arouse public sen\ntiment in favor of an effective\ncivil rights law. The original civil\nrights law, enacted in the Recon\nstruction Era, was emasculated by\nthe United States Supreme Court\nin the Slaughterhouse and Civil\nRights cases and finally by out\nright repeal by Congress of large\nportions of this legislation.\nAs a result, the two sections\nwhich are still in force have prov\ned inadequate in the protection of\ncivil rights, and with depriving\npersons of civil rights under color\nof law.\nThe other section deals with de\npriving citizens of civil rights\nunder color of state laws.\nRecently, President Truman\ncreated by executive order the\nPresident’s Committee on Civil\nRights to recommend legislation\nor other means to protect civil\nrights.\nWhile the Department of Jus\ntice has gathered a mass of in\nformation concerning violation of\ncivil rights in this country and\nfrom the experience of its law\nyers in prosecuting cases involv\ning such violations knows the\nweaknesses of the present stat\nutes, the recommendations of the\nPresident’s Committee will be\nmost likely the basis of any legis\nlative action that nt&y be taken.\nThe other section, deals with de\npriving citizens of civil rights\nunder color of state laws.\nRecently, President Truman\ncreated by executive order the\nPresident’s Committee on Civil\nRights to recommend legislation\nor other means to protect civil\nrights.\nWhile the Department of Jus\ntice has gathered a mass of in\nformation concerning violation of\ncivil rights in this country and\nfrom the experience of its lawyers\nin prosecuting cases involving\nsuch violations knows the weak\nnesses of the present statutes, the\n.‘recommendations of the Presi\ndent’s Committee will be most\nlikely the basis of any legislative\naction that may be taken.\nThe method of having the com\nmittee submit recommendations to\nthe President and Mr. Truman,\nin turn, send their recommenda\ntions to Congress will have the\neffect of avoiding any charge of\nexecutive dictation.\nNOTICE\nPAY YOUR\nPOLL TAX\non or before\nFEBRUARY 1st, 1947\n/\nREGISTER\nQUALIFY TO VOTE\nThis is a public Contribution of the\nJACKSON CHAPTER NO.
