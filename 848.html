ABRAHAMS, LICENSED AGENT AT SKAGWAY, REBUKED THE DEAH, The Theological Student Got Hie Re, venge In a Few Words., Thirty years ago Alexander Schmidt, was dean of th® university at Dorpat,, In the Russian province of Livonia., "The Bloodsmlth," as the students, called him because of his researches, concerning the circulation of the blood,, was noted for the severity of his dis, cipline. An amusing incident is told, of him by an army chaplain in the, Zeltung der 10. Armee:, A certain theological student once, wanted to get leave from the universi, ty to attend his sister\'s wedding. The, dean refused the necessary permission, on the ground that the reason was too, trivial. The student was greatly of, fended both because he wanted to go, to the wedding and because he sus, pected that Dr. Schmidt had not be, lieved that his excuse was a true one., Accordingly he was determined to get, some kind of revenge., It chanced that on the day after the, affair he was reading St Paul\'s second, letter to Timothy when he suddenly, saw a very clever way to get satisfac, tion. Laying down the Bible, he wrote, to the Dorpat newspaper and ordered, an advertisement Inserted in large, type that said simply. "II Tim. lv,, 14-15a.", Every reader of the paper, surprised, by that line, reached for his Bible and, looked up the verses. Imagine the, amusement of the university students, when they found that the passage was,, "Alexander, the coppersmith, did me, much evil; the Lord reward him ac, cording to his works; of whom be thou, ware also.", BURNING THE LEAVES., A Foolish Waste of What Might Be a, Valuable Fertilizer., Many tons of valuable fertilizer are, wasted every year through our practice, of raking the fallen leaves from lawns, anil parks into the street and burning, them. We destroy one of the best of, nature\'s fertilizers, that on which she, relies for the renewal of the vegetable, humus in the soil., All nature\'s protection Is removed in, the interest of tidiness. Then we won, der why lawns must be so frequently, resodded and why grass seed "won\'t, catch." The fallen leaves protect the, roots of grass and shrubs from the, freezing and thawing of winter and,, deposited In a corner of the back yard, with a little earth thrown over them to, prevent their blowing away, In a year, or two are converted into what the, forester calls "duff," an organic ma, terial which makes the loam that, grows the farmer\'s best crops., It is an excellent top dressing for the, lawn and enrichment for flowers and, shrubs and, mixed with a littlo ordinary, earth, a most desirable soil for filling, the window boxes and repotting plants,, something hard to get In town. It is, invaluable to the amateur gardener, who utilizes his back yard, and yet It is, almost invariably wasted. We pay, thousands of dollars every year for, phosphates and nitrates and overlook, this valuable product of nature\'s labor, atory.—Detroit Free Press., Nature\'s Monument to Washington., Among the many monuments to, Washington is the one which every, visitor to the Cape Verde islands will, remember as one of the most colossal, and marvelous freaks of natural sculp, ture In existence. Along the farther, side of the harbor of San Vicente, the, principal town, rises a bold ridge of, dark gray volcanic rocks, the crest of, which forms an exact likeness of our, immortal George, seemingly lying face, upward, as If in a peaceful sleep. The, hero\'s large, boJd features, the back, ward wave of the hair, his massive, shoulders and even the frill of the shirt, front are all reproduced on a gigantic, scale with wonderful exactness. The, strange monument, sharply outlined, against the deep blue of the tropical, sky, is one of the first objects that, meet one\'s eye in approaching the, island., Venui and Jupiter., The "earth\'s twin sister," Venus, Is, 67,000,000 miles from the sun._ It re, ceives more heat than we do. \\ery lit, tle Is known of Venus, and so few, markings are seen that it is not known, whether Venus rotates on its axis once, in twenty-four hours or once in 225, days., Jupiter, the plant of the sun\'s fam, ily, is covered with a shell of clouds, which change so rapidly that condi, tions there can be Interpreted only in, one way—that Jupiter is so large and, it has cooled so slowly that it Is still, far too hot to support life., Value of Knowledge., Knowledge Is like the coin of ex, change. A man is justified, to a de, gree, In taking pride in its possession, if he himself worked over the gold of, it and tried to coin it or, at least, if, he came by it honestly, already tested, out But when he did not do anything, of the kind, but just got it from some, passerby who threw it into his face,, then what ground has he to boast of, it?—John Ruskin., Abnormal Situation., "It is a wonder the majority of, stenographers in business offices are, feminine.", "Why is it?", "Because that is the only position, left in which a woman will let herself, be dictated to."—Baltimore American., Clasaified., Heiress—I want every one to know, that our engagement is broken., "All right I\'ll have it put in the, papers under the heading \'Business, Troubles.\' "—Life., VALUE OF SKIMMILK., Much Cheaper and More Nourishing, Than Round Steak., Skimmilk Is a very economical food, which should be more largely used. It, Is the same as whole milk except that, the butter fat has been taken from It, In sklmmllk there remains all the sug, ar, about four and one-half parts In, every one hundred, all of the mineral, salts, all of the protein. The protein, la the most valuable constituent of, milk. It not only serves as fuel for, the body as does the fat and sugars,, but supplies nitrogenous tissue build, ing material., Skimmilk should be classed, as whole, milk is, with eggs, meat, flsh, poultry, and cheese. The government\'s food, experts praise skimmilk and give us, these interesting figures to show its, value:, Two and a half quarts of skimmilk, contain almost as much protein and, yield about the same amount of en, ergy as a pound of round of beef., When skimmilk sells for 4 cents a, quart, or about 2 cents a pound, and, round of beef for 20 cents a pound, a, dime spent for skimmilk will provide, nearly twice as much nourishment as, it will if spent for round steak., When milk sours normally it still re, mains good food. It is not suitable for, the baby, but it will make good smear, case, or cottage cheese, one of the best, of foods.—New York Hail., THAT UPPER BERTH., Getting Into It Sometimes la a Good, Acrobatic Stunt., The ascent to an upper berth Is an, art in itself, and, as one would expect, of an art, it is long. I do not mean, the ascent by stepladder. There are, those who climb mountains by rail, road, who let minions put on their bait,, who require caddies to tee their golf, balls, who hunt with beaters to drive, the game toward them. There are also, those who reach their uppers on car, peted steps., l\'et the heroic breed Is not extinct, Luxury has not yet completely sapped, our national virility. Some of us are, made of sterner stuff. We climb un, assisted and alone., We are off. Quickly we assume po, sition A, with both hands grasping the, horizontal bar and with our right foot, firmly planted on the chest of the old, gentleman in the lower. We push off, vigorously. If the old gentleman\'s, chest be of a proper firmness and resil, iency this push brings us to position, B. with the left knee in the sharp knee, hold on the edge of the upper berth, and the right leg at large. The right, leg Is then brought convulsively up, ward and forward and laid carefully, In the upper berth, and the left leg If, at liberty to follow it From this point, on all Is plain squirming.—Frederick L., Allen In Century., Tennyson\'s Vanity., The Intricacies of a great man\'s char, acter are often simplicities to his wife., Once, when the late Alfred Austin, had paid a visit to Tennyson, hla Im, mediate predecessor, Tennyson walked, with him as far as the gate which led, to the highway. There, says Alfred, Austin in his autobiography, while the, elder poet stood leaning on the gate,, a party of wide eyed sightseers ap, peared., "What a vulgar people the English, are!" Tennyson exclaimed. "They come, here to watch for me. and when they, see me they say quite loudly, \'There\'s, Tennyson!\'", Mr. Austin afterward repeated this to, Lady Tennyson, who smiled tenderly,, but archly., "My husband would be much more, annoyed if the people didn\'t come,", she said., Invented the Check System., John Palmer, who died some years, ago in rather straitened circumstances, in a little town In Michigan, was the, Inventor of the check system. Palmer, was a fiddler and assumed responsibil, ity for the hats, coats and wraps of, those who came to his dancing parties., In keeping things straight he gave, numbered checks for the articles com, mitted to his care. Some railroad men, who attended one of the dances noticed, how perfectly the idea worked, appro, priated it and in a short time it was, adopted all over the country. As is, often the case, the inventor got noth, ing out of it—Philadelphia Press., New England\'s Name., The pilgrims had nothing to do with, the naming of New England. That, name was coined by Captain John, Smith of Pocahontas fame and one of, the founders of the Virginia colony., In 1G14 he explored and mapped the, northern coast then called North Vir, ginia, and renamed it New England., The Mayflower pilgrims did not arrive, until 1620, and the charter granted the, new colony adopted the name used in, Smith\'s map several years before., Cheerful Surroundings., Uncle Josh — Here\'s a letter from, Nephew Harry, that\'s gone to Africa,, and says that within twenty rods o\', his house there\'s a family o\' laughing, hyenas.
