Tho Democratic tnriff bill\nplaced hides and com on tho free list\nand almost immediately importations of\ncom and hides from Argentinn, where\nthis discaso is a common scourge,bi\ngnu.

In its issuo of last Thursday the\nWorld give utter.nnco to another sig\nnificant warning which ought to make\ncertain apostles of tho "now freedom"\'\nsit up and tnko notice. It says:\n"Now that foot ami mouth disease is\nplaying havoc with tho livo stock in\ndustry of tho United States\' it may bo\nwoll to tnko cognizance of another dis\nease menace;\n\'Corn is threatened.
