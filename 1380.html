Broyles has several\ntons of alfalfa stored, was discovered\nto be on fire and in less than twenty\nminutes it was in ashes. The Harvey\nhouse next to the passenger depot was\nthreatened by the flames, but the her\noic efforts of the fire department and\nstation employes saved it and the only\ndamage to the building was by water.\nThe railroad telegraph wires excepting\none, are all down. The dispatcher\'s of\nfice lias been removed into one of the\ncompany houses for the present. The\nfire was probably caused by a spark\nfrom an engine.

It Is\nhardly probable that such a move has\nthe approval of President Uoose.velt,\nwho has already gone on record as\ndisapproving the placing of tho control\nof tho reserves In the western country\nin the hands of eastern theorists.\nSo many problems, of rango conditions\nof lumbering, of Irrigation, of game\npreservation ana forest nres, are in\nvolved in the management, of the re\nserves that it Is absolutely necessary\nhat a western man, familiar with all\nthe conditions, bo in charge of there-\nserves.

Less\nthan a year ago, a pale faced New York\nyouth, Isidor Sllberman, arrived in Gol\nden, southern Santa Fe county, to visit\nTils uncle, L. D. Sugar, manager of the\nHazleton group of mining claims.\nChiefly for health reasons, he was giv\nen a pick and shovel and was set to do\ning assessment work. Starting in on\nan abandoned short tunnel on one of\nthe company\'s claims known as the Las\nVegas, he worked vigorously for sever\nal months when one day about six\nmonths ago, a single stroke of his pick\nrevealed a fourteen inch streak of de\ncomposed quartz bespangled with gold.\nThe young"New Yorker did not have to\nbe told that it was the real stuff. He\nlet fall his pick, snatched up a chunk\nof the gleaming quartz and hatless and\ncoatless ran for a mile and a half\nacross arroyos and sandy wastes to\nGolden where he laid his treasure be\nfore Mrs. Sugar, Mr. Sugar being away\nfrom home. Four days thereafter the\nmine was secretly worked and the find\nproved to be a pocket soon worked out\nbut yielding $2,000 in almost pure, na\ntive gold. To discover the main vein\nwas then the task of young Sllberman.\nHe prospected the surface for three\nmonths and finally determined to start\nanother tunnel higher up in the moun\ntain, in which he worked until last\nMonday when at ten feet below the\nsurface he spied a piece of wire gold as\nlarge as a knitting needle protruding\nfrom the quartz wall In front of him.\nIt was short and exciting work to get\nin on this quartz vein and with every\nstroke of the pick new and rare riches\nwere exposed. In the upper left hand\ncorner of the tunnel, four by six feet,\nthe vein is 18 inches wide where first\nstruck and 30 Inches wide In the lower\nright hand corner, A few feet farther\nin the whole face of the tunnel came\nthe same rich quartz, glittering with\nwire and nugget gold, some of the lat\nter being rare specimens of crystallized\ngold hitherto found only in several In\nstances in the southern Santa Fe min\ning districts. Mr. Sllberman exhibited\nat the Claire hotel yesterday several\nspecimens which were very beautiful.\nOne was a nugget as large as a cherry\nstone; another about the size and shape\nof a large pecan appeared to be one\nfourth pure gold. He Bays that when\nworking the mine the wire gold would\ncatch in his shoes and he had to be\ncareful lest people would see them\nwhen he came out of the tunnel and\ndiscover his secret. Crude tests indicate\nthat this quartz will return $75,000 to\nthe ton and upward as the discoverer\nphrased it. He said he knew nothing\nabout practical mining, but he crum\npled up a quantity of ore in his hand,\nit is very soft, and from the gold thus\nobtained he thinks It will yield at least\nan ounce to the pound, $40,000 to the\nton. Upon examining the strike, Man\nager Sugar sent Mr. Sllberman post\nhaste to Milwaukee, where the Hazle\nton Company stockholders reside, to\ntell them in his own rather boyish way\nthe story of the discovery, He left\nfor Milwaukee last night. In the mean\ntime, Mr. Sugar is endeavoring to as.\ncertain the full extent of the vein and\nto place the mine in readiness for in\nspection by a committee of stockhold\ners who will accompany young Sllber\nman on his early return from the east.\nThe mine is on the north slope of the\nSan Pedro\' mountains near the well\nknown Old Timer mine and adjoins a\nproperty owned by Hon. F. A. Man-\nzanares,- W. C. Gortner and others of\nLas Vegas, In which, In sinking a well\nfor the Monte CHsto Placer Company\na few years ago the drill of the Harold\nWell Boring Company penetrated 50\nfeet of gold bearing quartz at a depth\nof 600 feet, and particles of gold as\nlarge as grains of wheat were brought\nup from the depths of the drilling bit\nThis find will do much to attract new\nattention to the golden riches of south\nern Santa Fe county.\nDon\'t spoil your disposition with a\nbad dinner.

Albuquerque Clti\nzen.\nThe stand of the Albuquerque Citizen\nis well taken. It is a disgrace to the\ncity administration in particular and to\nthe citizens of Santa Fe in general that\nbetter sidewalks along the principal\nthoroughfares are not provided. Street\ncrossings in several places are also ab\nsolutely necessary. The city adminis\ntration should get a move on.\nThe Republicans of Minnesota, in\nconvention assembled at St. Paul, have\nfollowed the lead of all the other states\nwhich thus far have had state conven\ntions and endorsed unequivocally the\nadministration of President Roosevelt\nand declared that it is therefore the\nsense of this convention that President\nRoosevelt succeed himself as president\nof the United States." That is the way\nto talk. Such declarations leave no\ndoubt in the minds of the whole people\nas to where the Republican party will\nstand in the national convention nf\n1904.\nThe county commissioners sitting as\na board of equalization should do as\neven-handed justice as possible In mat\nters of raises of assessments. Wherein\nsuch appear to be justified they should\nbe sustained. In a few cases and Where\nthe appeals of the tax-payers against\nthe raise of assessments are supported\nby good and proper testimony the in\ncrease of assessments should be taken\noff. Let the county commissioners do\ntheir full duty in this matter. Only this\nand nothing more. If they do that\nproperty owners and tax-payers and\nhonest citizens of the county will in\ndorse their course.\nBut a few days to the July meeting\nof the county commissioners and it is\ntherefore not amiss to call attention to\nthe fact that the tax payers and prop\nerty owners of this county desire a set\ntlement and compromise of this coun\nty\'s great debt and that the county\ncommissioners are expected to bring\nsuch about at their July meeting. If a\ncompromise at 50 per cent of the bonds\ndelinquent coupons and judgments will\nnot be acquiesced In by the bondhold\ners, then a higher figure must be\nagreed upon and if 60 per cent lp 3 per\ncent bonds will bring about such a\ncompromise, such will have to be ac\ncepted. Tidings that are gruesome to tea\ndrinkers come from China. The Chi\nnese in order to honor their dead, cover\nthe corpse with tea leaves. But the\nChinese are also thrifty and after the\ncorpse has lain in the leaves for sever\nal days, the leaves are removed and\nsent to the United States with other tea\nimportations. As there are 10,000,000\ndeaths in China every year, and it\ntakes a good many pounds to cover a\ncorpse, it can readily be seen how great\na portion of Ithe imported Chinese tea\nmay have served as covering for a Chi\nnese corpse. The spreading of this fact\nmay drive many a tea drinker to\ndrinking whisky.\nA BIG COUNTRY.\nAt this session of congress which\njust adjourned over $800,000,000 were ap\npropriated. A few years ago when con\ngress appropriated $500,000,000 the cry of\nbillion dollar congress and extrava\ngance went up. But the country has\nbeen growing since then and the in\ncome is keeping good pace with the ex\npenditures so that the treasury has a\ngreater surplus than ever before. The\nclassification of the appropriations is\nsignificant.

M July 1, 1902,\nThe pust w eek lias been one of severe\ndrought in all seolloiiH of the territory.\nwith high, hot winds, most unusual at\nthis season of the year. In the extreme\nnortheast the temperatures of the 23d,\n24th and 26th were almost unpreceden\nted; at Albert, southern Union county.\nreaching 106, 108 and 105, respectively,\non these dates. Excepting in the lo\nentitles of permanent water supply, as\nthe dams of the lower Pecos and the\nupper waters of the mountain streams,\nirrigation water is becoming very\nscarce, and in many localities there is\nnone. The Rio Grande Is practically\ndry from Albuquerque south, and in\nwestern and southwestern sections\nsprings and wells are falling. Gardens,\nwhich are given the first preference for\nwhat water there Is to spare, are in\nvery good condition generally, but\nmany of the fields under ditch ara suf\'\nfering for water, and crops on temporal\nlands are drying up. On outside rang\nes the grass is getting very short and\nwater-holes are drying up. Cattle de\npending on general ranges are In very\npoor condition, and on many protected\nranges there is much suffering. Better\nconditions obtain over northeastern\ncounties, and in Lincoln, Chaves and\nEddy counties, but in central sections,\nand on the Socorro county ranges\nstockmen view the conditions with the\ngreatest anxiety. In some instances\nHANDY.\n"My mother suffered a long time from\ndistressing pains and general ill health\ndue primarily to indigestion," says L,\nW. Spalding, Verona,, Mo. "Two years\nago I got her to try Kodol. She grew\nonce and now, at the ago of 76\n..thing she wants, remarking\nihe fears no bad effects as she has\nbottle of Kodol handy."

Reports\nof the yield and quality of the clip\nvary considerably, but are generally\nfair. In many sections the ripening\nfrufb will be small unless early rains\ncome. Grasshoppers are reported as\ndoing considerable damage in some lo\ncalities, especially in the upper Rio\nGrande valley and the valleys contig\nuous, but even In these localities the\ndamage is not general.\nThe following remarks are extracted\nfrom the reports of correspondents:\nAlbert: H. M. Hanson: Remarkably\ncool on the 21st, immediately followed\nby an almost phenomenal spell of hot\nweather, accompanied by hot, dry\nwinds which gave the country a bleach\ned and dusty aspect In less than two\ndays. As crops generally were planted\nlate there is no immediate danger, but\nrain Is badly needed. Second crop of\nalfalfa is being cut and Is considerably\nbetter than the first. Shearing is in\nprogress. The heavy storm of last\nweek (16th) to the north of this sta\ntion, accompanied by hail, killed a\nnumber of sheep in Its path, as many\nas a hundred in one small bunch.

Van Doren: The con\ntinuous hot, dry winds are having a\nserious effect on all pastures, and out\nside ranges are suffering. All Irriga\nted crops, however, are looking well,\ncorn in particular. First cutting of al\nfalfa is finished, with a good yield. Rain\nbadly needed. Highest temperature,\n103; lowest, 51; no rain.\nEast Las Vegas: John Thornhlll: Hot\nweather continues, with dry, hot winds\nall week. No water to be had for irri\ngation; the river and ditches are dried\nup. Crops suffering greatly, and un- I\nless rain comes soon all crops will be a\ntotal failure. First alfalfa secured. On\nthe range water-lioles and grass are\nfast drying up.\nEastview: John W. Corbett: Vegeta\ntlon needing rain. Crops growfhg slow\nly, and stock water getting scarce ow\ning to the lack of snow last winter,\nGrazing is still fairly good. Highest\ntemperature, 96; lowest, 43; no rain.\nEspanola; P. H. Leese: Very dry and\nwater very scarce. Unless we get rain\nwithin the next ten days stock and\ncrops will suffer. In some localities the\ngrasshoppers are doing considerable\ndamage.\nFolsom: Jackson Tabor: Hot and\ndry; the 24th being the hottest day\nsince June 18, .1899. Grass is drying up\nfast on the range but thus far stock I\ndoing well. The second growth of al\nfalfa is starting nicely and with rain\nwill be a large crop. Grasshoppers are\ntroubling some fields but are not gen\neral. Highest temperature, 94; lowest,\n45; rain, 0.10.\nFrisco: Clement Hlghtower: Unus\nually hot and dry, and conditions de\ncidedly adverse to crops. No water In\nstreams for irrigation.

Stock can\nhold out for 30 days longer, but will be\nin very poor condition. Feed getting\nscarce. Fruit ripening but very small\non account of the drought.\nLa Luz (Otero Co.): Ernest Swift:\nHot, dry weather with high winds, but\ncrops not materially damaged so far.\nLos Alamos: Wm.

They wait for it to pass\noff, giving no thought to the cause.\nRemember these important facts, take\na mental note of them for future use,\nand when the time comes use them.\nThe kidneys are the sewers of the sys\ntem; they carry off the impure matter,\nbut sewers sometimes become clogged\nup. So do the kidneys. The kidneys\nare located near the small of the back,\nhence any stoppage affects the back.\nThis means backache, lame back, weak\nback and many other distressing symp\ntoms. There Is lots more to tell on this\nsubject, but we won\'t do it here, for we\nwant to show you how to keep the kid\nneys so the back will have no cause to\nache.\nA. S. Sampson, of 1729 Forest Avenue,\nKansas City, carpenter and painter by\ntrade, says "It la seven or eight years\nsince I first felt the effects of kidney\ntrouble and during all that time I\nhave had some very severe attacks, of\nten being laid up for weeks at a time\nnot able to work at all. I not only had\npains in my back, but my head ached so\nthat I thought at times that it would\nsplit. I doctored a great deal and used\nevery kind of medicine I knew about\nbut without relief. I finally tried\nDoan\'s Kidney Pills and I think I owe\nmy life to their use. I continued the\ntreatment until I had taken three boxes\nwhen the pains in my back were re- j\nlieved, my appetite returned and my\nwhole system was regulated."
