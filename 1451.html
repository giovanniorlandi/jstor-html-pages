I, SAMOA IN THE NEWS AGAIN, Ignored for .the most part by the ma, jority of Americans, our distant is, land\' possessions now and then remind, us of their existence by getting into, the new of the day. Not long .since j, the picturesque tale of .the capture of, Guam was recalled by the edict of the, American Governor against whistling., Ruled by a benevolent despot, the lit, tle island is fortunate in these days, in having no history. From Tutiril\'a, and Manua, the\' two Samoan Islands, administered, like Guam, by the Navy, Department, now comes a report, breaking a long silence. The benevo, lent despot has become unpopular, anil, the natives have been stoning his, house. So a court of inquiry under, Admiral Hughes/ will presently be, convened there., ! Yet Samoa was in every mouth just, over twenty years ago. Three Pow, ers, the United* States. Great- Britain, and Germany, had interests in the is, lands. The Germans, after their eusto, mary fashion, began to make trouble., There was civil war among the island, ers. in which we were nearly involved., The settlement of 1889 had guarar.-1, tred the independence and neutrality i, of Samoa, and a court to protect fore, igners, presided over by an American, was instituted. None the less there, was another war ten years later,, fomented by the Germans, between, rival kings. Germany backed one.1, Great Britain and the United States, the other; the villages around Apia,, held by the German favorite with, German help, were bombarded by, American and British ships. Only the, terrible typhoon which destroyed the, fleets averted what might have been, an outbreak of war among the Powers, themselves., It was at this time that the real dis, 11 position of Germany toward the, United States was revealed. People, forget easily; and when the Kaiser, was cultivating American friendship, and sending his brother over to seal, the bond, the antagonism aroused, net, only by German action at Samoa, but, also by German intrigue during the, Spanish\'War, was largely allayed., The Sarnonan Islands were divided, I between Germany and United States, in 1899, giving each country an im, portant foothold in the Pacific, which, Germany has since lost. It has been, supposed th.at the American govern, ed Samoans were contented with their, lot. But some one "seems to have fail, i, ed in tact in dealing with them. Thus, Samoa comes in\'to the news again. -, FOND HEARTS AND THE CELLAR, \' An equal division., of household, wines and liquors is "one of the pro, visions sought in a decree of divorce, A goodly store o? these at existing, prices would naturally be an import, ant part of the domestic assets., May there not be, by the same, token, reconciliations brought about, by alcoholic pressure? Emotional ap, peals "for the sake of the child" are, familiar in drama and presumably in, life. A well-filled cellar also might, have its share in reuniting divided, hearts., Nowadays the fellow who yearns, for a kick as yearned the Western, miner who drank nitroglycerin and, jumped off a roof, drink what the, bellboy "guarantees.", After looking over the new ones an, actor here and there decides that a, used play by William Shakespeare, has greater mileage in it if operated, by an expert., A feminist says women are the, more industrious because men never, try to earn a living washing clothes., The answer used to be that women, never sit up all night trying to win, a few dollars at draw poker, but that, answer is out of date., SPECIAL, Country butter, 60c pound; fresh, country eggs, 70 dozen; chickens. 50c, pound; 100 lb. bag sugar $16.40.
