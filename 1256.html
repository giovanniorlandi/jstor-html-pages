The Arabian / Persian Gulf (APG) is a shallow \nmarginal sea with a very wide range of temperature (10–48 °C) and salinity (42–65‰) \nand also highly impacted by anthropogenic activities (Sheppard et al. 2010). Kuwait \nlies in the northwestern APG, receiving freshwater input from Shatt-Al-Arab in Iraq, \nand has diverse habitats such as mud flats, sandy beaches, rocky shores, salt marshes, \nseagrass meadows, and coral reefs (Al-Yamani et al. 2004). The marine biodiversity of \nthese productive habitats is unique and adapted to live in these extreme environmental \nconditions (salinity > 41 ppt and sea water temperature, 14 to > 30 °C) which falls \nbeyond the physiological threshold for many organisms found elsewhere (Edmonds \net al. 2021). Anthropogenic activities such as coastal development, pollution, etc. has \nimmense impact on the fauna and flora in this marginal environment (Sheppard et al. \n2010; Burt 2014).\nThe heterobranch fauna of APG are rather poorly documented with sporadic reports\nfrom Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Iran (Glayzer et \nal. 1984; Jones 1986; Gosliner and Behrens 2004; Al-Yamani et al. 2012; Nithyanandan\n2012; Yonow 2012; Gosliner et al. 2015; Rezai et al. 2016; Al-Kandari et al. 2020; \nAmini-Yekta and Dekker 2021). In Kuwaiti waters to date, 35 species of heterobranchs \nwere recorded belonging to eighteen families and two orders (Al-Yamani et al. 2012; \nNithyanandan 2012). In the present study new records of heterobranchs are documented\nfrom an offshore island and artificial marine habitats in Kuwaiti waters during \nthe years 2012–2014.\nMaterials and methods\nThe Sabah Al-Ahmad Sea City (SAASC) is the largest coastal township development\nin Kuwait (Jones and Nithyanandan 2012a) covering an area up to 70 km2, \nwith a network of artificial lagoons and habitats ranging from intertidal to subtidal \nzone (ca. 10 m depth). Heterobranchs were recorded from various artificial marine\nhabitats (rock culverts, bridge piers, etc.) of SAASC (Fig. 1) by SCUBA div-\ning while conducting routine underwater surveys for benthic monitoring during \nthe years 2012–2014. Heterobranchs were photographed at 3–5 m depth using a \ndigital camera (Panasonic LUMIX DMC-TZ7) with a waterproof casing. Due to \nthe low density of animals observed, no attempts were made to collect reference \nspecimens. No live measurements of the individuals were carried out. One individual\nwas photographed from the rocky intertidal habitats of Failaka island dur-\ning an extensive intertidal benthic survey in the winter of 2014. All morphological \nfeatures described in this study are based on detailed examination of numerous \nphotographs using Adobe Photoshop CS6. The classification adopted in this study \nis based on Bouchet et al. (2017) and, for nomenclature, the World Registry of \nMarine Species (WoRMS 2021) was followed. Identification of recorded individuals\nwere based on Yonow (2008), Gosliner et al. (2015), and recent literature listed \nin WoRMS (2021).\n', 'New records of nudibranchs from Kuwait 93\nTaxonomic account\nClade TECTIPLEURA Schrödl, Jörger, Klussmann-Kolb & Wilson, 2011\nSuper Order EUOPISTHOBRANCHIA Jörger, Stöger, Kano, Fukuda, Knebelsberger\n& Schrödl, 2010\nOrder CEPHALASPIDEA P.

SAASC Al-Khiran, 13 June 2012, one individual photographed \nat 3 m depth in sandy substrate, R. Dinesh Kumar.\nDescription. The individual has a black body colour, prominent electric blue spots \nscattered over the dorsum, head, and parapodia (Fig. 2). White flecks interspersed with \nelectric blue spots are found on the head and along the edges of the parapodia. The caudal\nflaps are unequal with the left longer than the right, and with an electric blue spot \nat the base of the left caudal flap (see Fig. 2). The blue spots on the anterior portion of \nthe propodium form a coalescent line which is partly visible in this individual (Fig. 2).\nDistribution.

Yonow (1994a) described Ch. livida from Eilat, Israel, in the north-eastern\nRed Sea. In Ch. livida, both sides of the mouth bear whitish or yellowish sensory \nbristles which is visible in the frontal view or if viewed from above (Yonow 1994a); \nhowever, it is not clearly visible in the photograph of the individual presented in this \nstudy due to the angle at which it was photographed (Fig. 2). The head shield has two \nshort processes on its lateral side, which is bit longer in the left compared to the right \nside and tubular when the animal is in relaxed state (Yonow 1994a). This was clearly \nobserved in the individual recorded in this study (Fig. 2). The individual recorded from \nMozambique (Tibiriçá and Malaquias 2017: fig. 2f ) has prominent electric blue rings \nthat are scattered over the dorsum and parapodial margin. The caudal flaps are rather \nthin, the right one short and the left one elongated with a prominent electric blue spot. \nHowever, the individual observed in this study has short and thick caudal flap with a \nthin, pointed tip and a blue spot at its base (Fig. 2). The species possesses a highly reduced\ninternal shell. This is a new record to both Kuwait and the APG, this record de-\nnoting a range extension into the northern APG from its type locality in the Red Sea.\nFigure 2. Chelidonura livida Yonow, 1994.

Johnson and Gosliner (2012), in considering the monophyletic nature \nof the genus Chromodoris, suggested a revision in the classification by moving some \nIndo-Pacific chromodorids to the genus Goniobranchus. According to WoRMS (2021) \nGoniobranchus naiki Valdez, Mollo & Ortea, 1999 from Mandapam, southern India \nis a junior synonym of G. bombayanus (Winckworth, 1946). In G. naiki, Valdés et al. \n(1999) and Gosliner et al. (2015) indicated the occurrence of translucent white spots on \nthe dorsum; in the individual recorded during this study only faint opaque spots were \nobserved (Fig. 3). In G. bombayanus the posterior portion of the foot extends beyond \nthe mantle as a white tail with no dark spots (Winckworth 1946), which is also visible \nin the photographed individual (Fig. 3, arrowed).

This species exhibits a high degree of variability in colour pattern and \nthe bright yellow spots observed in the individual during the present study was similar\nto a specimen recorded from Eilat, northern Red Sea (Ben Tov 2003). A second \ncolour morph (Fig. 6B) was also recorded with triangular blue grey patches on the \neither side of the dorsum as illustrated in Yonow (2008). Hypselodoris infucata can \nbe easily confused with H. kanga Rudman, 1977 due to morphological similarities \n(Rudman 2007; Mehrotra et al. 2021). In H. infucata the gills are rather simple with \na bright red line on the outer and inner edges, whereas in H. kanga, they are triangular \nwith three lines and, distinctively, with white or yellow spots in-between (Rudman \n2007). Bluish purple lines usually occur in the dorsum of H. kanga (Mehrotra et \nal. 2021); however, individuals observed in this study only have dark blue or black \nspots. Hypselodoris infucata differs externally from another congener, H. roo Gosliner \n& Johnson in Epstein et al. 2018, in not having a white spot at the base of the rhinophores\non the posterior side and a broad posterior portion of the notum (Epstein et \nal. 2018).

A new record to Kuwait and the APG.\nDiscussion\nKuwait’s rich and unique marine biodiversity is poorly documented and more coordinated\nbiodiversity assessments for sustainable management are essential (e.g., \nEdmonds et al. 2021). The offshore and inshore coral reef habitats are important for \nseveral invertebrate and vertebrate species (Papathanasopoulou and Zogaris 2015). \nPost-gulf war economic development of Kuwait has led to innovative coastal development\nprojects (e.g., Sabah Al Ahmad Sea City) which has increased the extent of both \nthe shoreline and coastal habitats, enhancing marine biodiversity and fisheries (Jones \nand Nithyanandan 2012b; Nithyanandan 2012; Myers and Nithyanandan 2016; \nNithyanandan et al. 2016).\nIn this study five new records of heterobranch sea slugs to Kuwait and the APG \nand two potentially new species are reported. Furthermore, this study increases the \ntotal number of heterobranch fauna of Kuwait to 40 species, which is 28% of the \nnumber reported from both the APG and Gulf of Oman (Amini-Yekta and Dekker\n2021).\nFigure 8. Caloria indica (Bergh, 1896). Photograph Don Christopher Pereira.\n', 'Manickam Nithyanandan et al.  /  ZooKeys 1048: 91–107 (2021)102\nThe occurrence of diverse habitats such as sand, mud flats, rocks, coral reefs, seagrass\nbeds, etc. provides many more opportunities to examine and expand knowledge \nof the heterobranch diversity in Kuwaiti waters. Harsh environmental conditions in \nthe APG waters of Kuwait potentially governs the impoverished biodiversity of marine \nbiota. Extensive coastal development in the Arabian Peninsula with wide range of artificial\nmarine substrates such as breakwaters, jetties etc. serves as viable benthic habitats \nattracting colonisation of marine biota (Burt and Bartholomew 2019). In Kuwait, \navailability of a wide range of benthic substrates both in natural habitats (Al-Kandari et \nal. 2020) and massive coastal development such as SAASC (Jones and Nithyanandan \n2012a) serve as important areas for nudibranch diversity. The colonisation of benthic\ninvertebrates such as sponges, hydroids, etc. in SAASC (Jones and Nithyanandan \n2012a; Nithyanandan 2012), which are key prey items for sea slugs (McDonald and \nNybakken 1997), could potentially attract them to these artificial habitats. A recent \nintensive study on sea slug diversity from Thailand indicates the importance of understanding\nhabitat diversity (both natural and artificial) and ecology which drives the \nfunctional diversity (Mehrotra et al. 2021).\nHistorically in Kuwaiti waters efforts were only laid to understand the diversity of \nheterobranchs (Glayzer et al. 1984; Jones 1986; Al-Yamani et al. 2012; Nithyanandan\n2012). Thus, a huge knowledge gap exists in understanding habitat diversity, \nfood preferences, predator-prey interactions, and animal associations in heterobranchs \nfrom this marginal environment, which are key factors in driving its diversity and \necology. In the near future, intensive surveys and collecting efforts should incorporate \nthese objectives which could not only help in documenting the diversity of heterobranchs\nin Kuwait and in the rest of the Arabian / Persian Gulf but also their valuable \necological functions.\nAcknowledgements\nMN is thankful to La Ala Al Kuwait Real Estate Co.
