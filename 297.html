Sold by\nIT CLItS V«\nDurable Roads Built of It at\nSmall Cost.\nPREPARATION OF ROADBED.\nCareful Grading and Firing Necessary.\nHighways That Are Constructed of\n"Gumbo" Clay Should Be Relied Un\ntil Smooth and Hard.\nIn large areas in the south sedimen\ntary clays are found very generally.\nIn these areas the clays are of a par\nticularly plastic and sticky variety\nknown as "gumbo" and "buckshot." In\nsuch localities traffic is absolutely im\npossible during the wet season, as the\nwheels uf heavy vehicles will sink to\nthe hub.\nGumbo clay is black, owing to the\nhigh percentage of organic or vegeta\nble matter it contains. It is particu\nlarly sticky in its nature, and is al\nmost wholly free from sand and grit.\nFrom Good Koads Magazine, New York.\nWELL BUILT BURNT CLAY HIGHWAY.\nAfter it has been burned, however, the\nplasticity is entirely destroyed, and a\nlight clinker is formed which, though\nI not particularly hard, when pulverized\nforms a smooth surface and seems to\nwear well. It should be understood\nthat not all of the clay out of which\nthe road is to be constructed Is to be\ncliu^ered, but only a sufficient amouut\nshould be rendered nonplastic to neu\ntralize the too sticky character of the\nnative clay.\nGood sound wood, as dry and well\nseasoned as it is possible to procure,\nshould be provided before beginning\nthe work and stacked at convenient\nintervals along the side of the road.\nAbout one cord of wood has been found\nnecessary for eight linear feet of road\nbed twelve feet wide.\nAfter grading the road to au even\nwidth between ditches it is plowed up\nas deeply as practicable. It will be\nfound necessary to use horses or\nmules, as the extremely heavy nature\nof the clay makes the work of deep\nplowing difficult. After the plowing\nhas been completed furrows are dug\nacross the road from ditch to ditch,\nextending through and beyond the\nwidth to be burned. If it is intended\nto burn twelve feet of roadway the\ntransverse furrows should he sixteen\nfeet long, so as to extend two feet on\neach side beyond the width of the final\nroadway. Across the ridges formed\nbetween these furrows, which should\nbe about four feet apart, the first\ncourse of cord wood is laid longitudi\nnally so as to form a series of flues in\nwhich the firing is started.\nThe best and soundest cord wood is\nselected for this course and should l>e\nlaid so that the pieces will touch, thus\nforming a floor. Another layer of\nwood is thrown irregularly across this\nfleor, in crib formation, with spaces\nleft between in which the lumps of\nclay are piled.\nAfter the lumps of clay have been\nheaped upon this floor a third course\nof wood is laid parallel to the first.\nThis third course is laid in exactly the\nsame manner as the first, and each\nopening aud crack should be filled\nwith brush, chips, bark, small sticks\nor any other combustible material.\nThe top layer of clay is placed overall,\nand the finer portions of the material\nare heaped over the whole structure.\nThe deep covering of clay which is\nthrown over all should be taken from\nthe side ditches and may be in lumps\nof all sizes, including the very finest\nmaterial. Tt is spread as evenly as pos\nsible over the top in a layer of not\nless than six to twelve inches. Finally\nthe whole is tamped and rounded off\nso that the heat will be held within\nthe flues as long as possible.\nWhen the roadbed has been care\nfully prepared according to the fore\ngoing directions the firing should be\ngin. If, however, a large force of\nlaborers are available for the work a\ngreater number of flues can be fired\nat one time.\nWhen the material is suffi Gently\ncooled the roadbed should be brought\nto a high crown before rolling, to\nallow for the compacting of the ma\nterial. This can be best done with a\nplow or a grader. After this the roll\ning should be begun and continued\nuntil tire roadbed is smooth and hard\nThe finished crowu should have a slope\nof at least one-half inch to the foot.\nAlthough it cannot be denied that\nthe gumbo and buckshot clays of the\nsouth are particularly adapted for\nbunting on account of the high per\ncentage of organic matter which they\ncontain, it Is none the less probable\nthat many of the surface clays and\nsoils of tlie states farther north \' • "\nbe treated in the same way. and. it\nfact, any soil or clay which bricks f t\nclinkers at a comparatively low tern\nperature should be suitable for the\nwork,\nThey Are Becoming Important Owing\nto Increase of Automobile Traffic.\nUntii recently the location of high\nways has been governed more b;\ngrade, thau by alignment. For obvious\nreasons horse drawn vehicles demand\ned easy grades, but were little affected\nby sharp curves* Consequently roads\nwere so laid out as to meet this re\nquirement, being made to wind around\nhills aud follow tortuous water\ncourses with little attempt to provide\nurves of long radii. The result is a\nhighway system which, except in level\ncountry, is composed of crooked roads,\nwell adapted to the needs of wagon\ntraffic, picturesque aud pleasing, but\nunsuited to the requirements of a\ntraffic composed of heavy motor driveu\nvehicles traveling at high speed.\nSafety is a factor that hitherto has\nentered into the work of road build\n<o only a very limited extent, but\nwhich is constantly assuming more im\nportance. The rapidly increasing use\nof motor vehicles places this new re\nsponsibility on the roadmaker, and\nthe building of new roads with longer\ncurves aud the realignment of old\nroads will do much toward reducing\nthe dangers attendant upon the new\nmodes of transportation.\nThe existence of a curve generally,\nthough uot necessarily, presupposes\nthe presence on the inner side of some\nobstruction shutting off the view of\nthe roadway ahead from a vehicle\ntraveling around it. Curves having\nradii of 1,000 feet or less are of com\nmon occurrence in such places, aud a\nwidth of thirty feet iu the clear is as\ngreat as that found on many country\nroads. On such a curve the driver\nof au automobile running in the mid\ndle of the road can see au approach\ning car, also in the middle of the\nroad, only about 350 feet ahead At\nthirty miles an hour a little less than\nnine seconds are required to traverse\nthis distance, and if each car were\nrunning at that speed only a little over\nfour seconds would elapse betweeu\nthe instant wheu they came in sight\nof each other and their meeting. Many\nconsiderations prohibit the establish\nment of an arbitrary minimum radius\nfor highway curves, but a careful\nstudy of prevailing conditions sltows\nclearly that more attention will have\nto be paid to this phase of road build\n; in the future than has been ac\ncorded to it in the past. Roads must\nbe economical, they must be durable,\naud they must satisfy the conditions\nthat experience has imposed upon\nthem, but they must he safe.\nCURVES AND GRADES.\nA\nOIL VALUABLE TO ROADS.\nMakeB Them Waterproof In Winter\nand Dustprocf in the Summer.\nSome interesting data concerning the\nvalue of oil in the making of good\nroads appeared in a Kansas experi\nment station bulletin. An evenly\ngraded stretch of sandy loam road a\nquarter of a mile long and thirty feet\nwide was sprayed with an oil residue\nor residuum. A dust mulch about four\ninches deep had formed on this road\nand had caused almost a cessation of\ntraffic. The road was first plowed to a\ndepth of four and one-half inches and\nthen thoroughly pulverized with a liar\nrow. Oil to the extent of one gallon\nper square yard was then sprinkled\nand harrowed in, after which the road\nwas floated. The road was closed to\ntraffic for a week after this .treatment.\nThe effect of freezing weather on the\nroadbed was the object first studied.\nThe results proved that the oil made a\nFrom Good Roads Magazine, New York.\nONE METHOD OF OILING KOAD.\nwaterproof shed aud kept the under\nlying soil sufficiently dry to prevent\nserious Injury by frosts. The question\nof the durability of a road seems also\nsettled when roads are treated with\noil, as this road successfully withstood\nall kinds of heavy traffic. In the hot\ntest season it was deemed necessary\nto spray again with oil, about half a\ngallon to the square yard, to keep\ndown a slight layer of dust. The esti\nmated cost of oiling this road is $525\nper mile, although some of it varied\nand the extreme cost went as high as\na rate of $1,300 per mile.\nimportance of Good Roads.\nIt is hard to figure out who is hit\nthe hardest when a rural route is dis\ncontinued on account of the iiupassa\nbility of the roads. It is a harm work\ner to the farmer ou the route that\nmeasures greater than the harm to\nany one who is a beneficiary of the\nservice, but the merchant is also a\ngreat loser, and it stands him well in\nhand to keep advised of the road con\nditions in his locality and to talk, act\nand work for good roads all the time.\nis\nis\nStation Agents to Boost Good Roads.\nThe officials of the Pennsylvania\nrailroad have started a movement to\nhave station agents along its lines be\ncome good roads advocates in an ef\nfort to have the roads near the sta\ntions improved.

Who has not\nwaited for the someone, for the sometime,\nthat might be for years and might be for\never?\nOn the stage of waiting there have been\nbroken hearts, thwarted ambitions, ruined\nhopes and the helpless overthrow of\nstrentii and purpose. But, on the other\nhand, the impenetrable curtain of the fu\nture has rolled up before waiting eyes and\nanxious hearts, bringing gladness and joy\nand fulfillment of hope deferred in cher\nished plans, the sight and return of loved\nones, the reality of dreams, the perfecting\nof purpose, the smooting, polishing of\nrough stones over which they have long\nstumbled, and the revealing of other kindly\nacts of encouragement to numerous ones\nwhose feet were almost gone into despair.\nThe young wait for more of life; the old\nfor less of death. The anticipations of the\nyoung are highly colored, magnified pic\ntures of the impossible. They expect more\nthan ever comes. Life to them is a fairy\nbook, which they believe in until Aladdin\'s\nlamp and the roc\'s eggs are discovered to\nbe myths. The illusion has been sweet to\nthem, but the inevitable awakening comes\nat last.\nThe old have looked into the future as\nfar as human eye can see, and it is then\nthat youth repeats itself in the fullness of\nexpectation. The feeble old heart acquires\nnew courage; the tottering old feet once\nmore stand on tiptoe; the weakened old\neyes (they think) shine with clearer vision,\nand in the garden of their dreams there\nare no longer desolate and waste places,\nbut sweet fields, green pastures and still\nwaters. They wait again for the glory and\nmanifestation and beauty of a world that\nnever yet was on this earth.\nWhat will their awakening be, and of\nwhat sort? _\nA\nPERVERTING HISTORY.\nIn another column on this page will be\nfound the announcement of Judge A. J.\nMurff of Shreveport, as a candidate for\nCongress from this district. Judge Murff\nis well and favorably known in this parish,\nwhere he made his home for many years.\nHe was principal of Bellevue Academy, at\nthat time one of the best schools in the\nparish, three years; was Parish Superin\ntendent of the public schools of Bossier\nfour years, and District Attorney of this\nJudi ial District eight years, filling these\npositions with credit to himself and to the\nsatisfaction of the people he served.\nJudge Murff is an able lawyer and a\ngentleman of high character and unim\npeachable integrity. He seeks a position\nhe is eminently capable of filling and comes\nbefore the people with a good record.\nWe heartily congratulate the Mansfield\nEnterprise on the attainment of its fourth\nbirthday, which occurred last Saturday.\nMay brother Hewitt enjoy many years of\nprosperity is all the harm we wish him.\nThe best way to get rid of meddlesome\nlobbyistsis to elect lobby-proof legislators.\nNorthern historians seek to misrepresent\nthe South in every conceivable way—dis\nparage its people and institutions and dis\ncredit the valor of its soldiers in the Con\nfederate War. Sensational and untruthful\n. Northern writers have flooded the country\nwith so-called histories that represent their\nsoldiers as always driving back and in\ngloriously defeating their enemies, while\nthe valor of the Confederate soldiers is\ndiscredited in every possible manner. Be\ncause 2,800,000 Federal soldiers, after four\nyears hard fighting, defeated 600,000 Con\nfederate soldiers after their country had\nbeen overrun, devasted and pillaged, many\nNorthern historians have drawn theconelu\nsion that the Yankees were better fighters\nthan the Confederates; but this point of\nview is best illustrated by an anecdote.\n" Dey say," remarked a German, "dat\nde Irish vas great fighters; but dey aind\'t\nno fighters at all yet. Vy, me und my\nbruder, uhd two udder vellows, ve licked\nhell oudt of an Irishman last veek."\nFrom a similar point of view, according\nto Northern writers, the Confederates were\nno fighters._\nJUDGE A. J. MURFF.\nBILL\nSILLY\nA member of the lower house of the i\nGeneral Assembly has given notice that j\nhe will file a bill requiring that "all mem\nbers of School Boards be subject to the\nsame examination as Pari m Superintend\nents." The bill will hardly become a law,\nbecause it is not practical, especially in the ;\ncountry districts. School Boards are sup\nposed to be composed of men who possess\'\nmore practical than theoretical knowledge, j\nA man may be a safe executive and ex\nperienced in business affairs, yet to a large\ndegree ignorant of the "sciences\'^ as\ntaught nowin our public schools. On the\nother hand, one may be versed in the re\nquirements that a superintendent must\npossess, yet a failure in executive ability\nand common sense. Our public school j\nsystem is already hedged in with useless |\nand unreasonable rules and regulations,\ntherefore, it is hoped it will not be enoum- j\nbered further by such idiotic legislation as.\nthe passage of the bill referred to. And, j\nbesides, it is too often the case in elections j\nthat the masses do not stop to consider the\nfitness of a candidate for office, but rather\nthe fitness of the salary to the man.— :\nM ansfiel d Journal. j\nThis proposed "idiotic legislation" is no |\ndoubt the cunning work of ex-Supermtend\nent As well, who has made a political ma- 1\nchine of the school system of this State in ■\nthe interest of his political aspirations. At:\nthe least, this idiotic measure is in keeping\nwith Aswell\'s baneful influence and med\ndlesome teaching during the past six years.\nTruly, "Our public school system is al\nready hedged in with useless and unrea\nsonable rules and regulations," and our\nlegislators should turn a deaf ear to, this\npersistent lobbyist, who has done more to\ndeprive the white people of this State of\ntheir rights than any other official since\nthe dark days of Radical Reconstruction.\nGentlemen of the Assembly, show all\nsuch interlopers the door!\nDEATH OF SENATOR S. D. MeENERY.\nSamuel Douglas McEnery, Louisiana\'s\nsenior United States Senator, died in New\nOrleans Tuesday morning. He left Wash\nington after the adjournment of Congress\nSaturday afternoon apparently in good\nhealth, butafter reaching Lynchburg, Va.,\nhe suffered a violent attack of indigestion,\nbut was somewhat relieved on his arrival\nin New Orleans Monday. Tuesday morn\ning, however, he began io sink steadily\nnntil his death at 9 o\'clock.\nSenator McEnery was born at Monroe,\nOuachita Parish, May 28,1837, He served\nin the Confederate Army, as a lieutenant,\nin Virginia and in the Trans-Mississippi\nDepartment. He was a lawyer by profes\nsion.\nAt the State Democratic Convention held\nin Baton Rouge, October 7, 1879, Senator\nin Baton Rouge, October 7, 1879, Senator\nMcEnery was nominated on the second\nballot, over Lewis Texada of Rapides, for\nLieutenant-Governor with Louis A. Wiitz\nas Governor. On the death of Wiitz, Oc\ntober 16, 1881, McEnery succeeded him in\nthe Executive Office. McEnery was nom\ninated and elected Governor in 1884. In\n1888 he was a candidate for re-nomination\nand was defeated by General Francis T.\nNicholls, who appointed McEnery to be\nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court for\nthe term of twelve years. In 1892 McEnery\nwas again a candidate for Governor and\nwas defeated by Murphy J. Foster\nIn 1896 McEnery was elected\nStates Senator from this State; re-elected\nin 1902 and again re-elected in 1908, and\nhis term would have expired in 1915.\nTwo "First" Bales of Texas Cotton.\nUnited*\nThe two "first" bales of Texas cotton\nfor the year were received at Houston at\n7:26 o\'clock last Thursday morning on the\nsame train from Mercedes and Brownsville.\nA special automobile was in waiting for the\nMercedes bale which was thus enabled to 1\nreach the Houston Exchange four minutes :\nahead of the Brownsville bale. The Mer\ncedes bale, weighing 416 pounds, was sold t\nat auction, gaining the prize, at 8375. The I\nBrownsville bale was sold for 850—fourj\nminutes time making a difference of 8325!\nin the value between the two bales, and\npractically proving, in this instance, at !\nleast, the truth of the adage that "time is j\nmoney." _______ j\n^ . , r • i , , !\nOur extravagant Legislature has over- 1\nalure has over\nlooked an excuse to create another sinecure\nfor the benefit of political grafters. The\nfrog industry offers a refuge fora few more\npolitical barnacles. By all means let us\nhave a law enacted creating a Bullfrog\nConservation Commission, with the regu\nlation salary of 85,000 per annum for the\ncomraissioner, 83,600 for an attorney, a\nnumber of high-salaried subordinates and\nseveral thousand dollars for "office ex\npenses." While not busy drawing their\nsalaries and repairing political fences, the\nmembers of the board can devote apart\nof their time, as a healthy diversion, i n\npracticing the absorbing game of leap-frog,\nthereby also "conserving" that long neg\nlected pastime, handing it down to future\ngenerations in all of its gradeur and use\nfulness. -\nJohnson: Integrity without knowledge\nis weak and useless, and knowledge with\nout integrity is dangerous and dreadful.\nJUDGE MURFF\'S ADDRESS\nFourth\nthe\nVoters\ni To the Democratic\nj\n; his party pledges\nplatform by voting\nCongressional District.\n_/y Dear Sirs: Some months since T\nissued a letter, which was published in the\npapers, in which 1^ charged our present\ncongressman, Mr. Watkins, with violating\nand the Democratic\nwith the Republicans\nand for Republican measures (hat were in\nj direct conflict with party instructions.\nBelieving that no good Democrat could\nendorse his actions, I intimated that I would j\nmake the race against him, provided the\nDemocrats did not think there was a more\navailable candidate for the place. Having\nwaited for some time and no other man\nhaving been suggested and having re\nj C eived. hearty endorsement from many of\n| t be leading citizens throughout trie district,\nj have decided to make the race,\nj j shall not boast 0 f my virtues, but leave\nyou judge me from my record, for it is\nj we ( j Q an( j not w h a t we say that\nj rata6>ilvg t be man.\nj represented the parishes of Bossier, ;\nWebster and Bienville for eight years as j\n: District Attorney, and the Parish of Caddo j\nj for three years as District Judge. I\n| I shall not call upon outsiders to vouch j\nfor my Democracy, but lay my record at j\n1 your feet, as my only witness, and let you j\n■ be my judges.\nMy platform, if elected, wjll be that of\nm y party and my people, and if the time\never comes when I can not carry out the\nto\nmandate of the Democratic party, I shall\nreturn it with my commission, unsullied, to\nthe people who gave it. I shall not be\ndraggle it in the dust and mire of Repub\nlicanism, nor sacrifice its principles upon\nthe altar of "special interests." I shall\nnot tear from it one single plank, or write\nin it one single policy antagonistic to\nDemocracy, nor shall I put up my own\nopinion against the combined wisdom of the\nparty. If it be silent upon any principle of\ngovernmental policy I shall be guided by\nthe leading tener.t of Democracy, " equal\nrights to ail and special privileges to none."\nI have no fight to make against any man\nor class of men, so long as they recognize\nthe rights of the people, but will oppose with\nall my energy any measure that seeks to\nmake the masses of the people pay an un\nfair tribute to the "special interest" class\nno matter under what pretext it is sought\nto be done.\nIt has been said that a poor man can not\nbe elected to Congress unless the "special\ninterest" class are back of him. If this\nbe true, it is so because the people allow\nthe "special interest" class to control and\ndominate our politics. I believe the time\nhas come when the people must make a\nstrong fight for Democracy, which stands\nfor a government for and by the people.\nWhile I am a poor man, and shall doubt\nless be opposed at every step by the\n"special interest" class, I have still an\nabiding faith in Democracy and the people,\nand with their help can win.\nI have no private secretary, paid by the\ngovernment, to keep the mails flooded with\nliterature in my behalf, nor can I send you\nthat literature without postage, but shall\nhave to bear all this expense myself.\nTherefore, 1 take this method of asking\neach and every Democrat for his vote and\nsupport.\nBeing nine parishes in the district, I\nshall not be able to see in person each\nvoter » but shall make public speeches in\neach parish before the campaign closes,\nwhere I hope all will come to hear me dis\ncuss with my opponent the issues of the\ncampaign.\nSoliciting the vote and influence of each\nand every Democrat, I am, with respect,\nA.

Green of Auburn,\nInd., at Corinth, Miss., May 30, 1862.\nThou to the mercy seat our souls doth gather,\nTo do our duty unto thee, Our Father,\nTo whom all praise, all honor, should be given:\nFor thou art the great God who art in heaven:\nThou by thy wisdom rui\'st the world\'s whole frame;\nForever, therefore, hallowed be thy name;\nLet nevermore delay divide us from\nThy glorious grace, but let Ihy kingdom come;\nLet thy commands opposed be by none ;\nBut thy good pleasure and. thy will be done,\nAnd let our promptness to obey pc even\nThe very same on earth ns \'tie in heaven:\nThen for our souls, O Lord, we also pray,\nThou wouldst be pleased to give us this day\nThe food of life, wherewith our sou\'s are fed,\nSufficient raiment and our daily bread;\nWith every needful thing do thou relieve us,\nAnd of thy mercy, pity : and forgive us\nAll our misdeeds for Him whom thou didst please\nTo make an offering for our trespasses,\nAnd forasmuch, O Lord, as we believe\nThat thou wilt pardon us as we forgive\nLet that love teach, wherewith thou dost acquaint us, to\nPardon all those who trespass against us; _\nAnd thou sometimes thou find\'st we have îorgot\nThis love for thee, yet help ami lead us not\nThrough soul or body\'s want to desperation;\nXor let the earth\'s gain drive us into temptation:\nLet not the soul of any true believer ■\nFail in the time of trial, but deliver\nYea, save them from the malice of the devil\nAnd both in life and death, keep us from evil:\nThus pray we, Lord, for that of thee, from whom\nThis may be had, for ihine is the kingdom;\nThis world is of thy work; its wondrous story\nTo thee belongs: the pa ver; tine, the glory\nAnd all thy wondrous works h ve ended never,\nBut will remain forever and forever.\nThus we poor creatures would confess again,\nAnd thus would sav eternally, Anten.\nAround the Court House.\nDistrict Court convened here Monday\nmorning, Judge R.

D. M Stearns.\nHaving considered two of these sev\nen parables, we are asked in this les\nson to take up the remaining five. We\nconclude from verse 53 that all the\nseven formed one discourse, spoken at\none time, four publicly and three, with\nthe explanation of the second, more\nprivately to the disciples only (verse\n3Ut. We must remember that He is\nin the whole discourse describing dif\n1 feront phases of this present age from\nIlis rejection until His coming again,\nthe mysteries of the kingdom. What\never symbol or figure He explains\nstands good for the whole discourse—\nj as, for example, "the held is the\nworld," the birds represent the wicked\nJ one, the enemy is the devil, the bar\n[ vest is tlie end of the age. In the first\n; parable only perhaps a fourth- part of\n! the seed bears fruit, at least only a\nI part without saying how much. In\n[ the second the children of God and\n! of the wicked one continue side by\nj side throughout the whole age. In the\nthird there is the unnatural growth\nfrom the least of till seeds, not only of\nan herb, but of a tree, in the branches\nof which the birds of the air lodge.\nIn the fourth, the parable of the\nleaven, a woman is seen leavening, or\ncorrupting, her food, for from Ex. xii,\nwhere the houses laid to be searched\nand all leaven put away, all through\nthe Bible leaven is without exception\na symbol of evil. Our I«ord taught to\nbeware of the leaven of the Pharisees\nand of the Sadducees (xvi, 0), and Paul\ntaught to put away the leaven of\nmalice and wickedness and use the\nunleavened bread of sincerity and\ntruth (I Cor. v, 8). Tile rule in all the\nsacrifices was \'\'burn no leaven nor\nany honey" (I.ev. ii. ID, but there was\none exception made in reference to a\nthanksgiving offering, and leaven was\ncommanded to represent the evil that\nwas in their thanksgiving (Lev. vii,\n12, 13, and Amos iv, 5). This woman\nevidently represents the professing\nchurch thoroughly corrupting her\nteaching, and it Is even now, as was\nforetold in II Tim. iff, 5; iv, 3, a form\nof godliness denying the power and a\nrefusal to endure sound doctrine. Uni\ntarianism and Infidelity are hi many a\npulpit where only the pure gospel\nought to be preached. Sarah did bet\nter when she took throe measures of\nmeal and baked unleavened cakes for\nher visitors (Gen.- xviii, «). With the\ndevil catching away the seed or hin\ndering ti»e fruit, sowing tares, enter\ning the church, causing false doctrine\nto be taught, it does not look encour\naging, but we are glad that He is not\ndiscouraged and that He has told us\nwhat lo expect (Isa. xlii, 4).\nLet us hear tlie other parables spo\nken in the house to the disciples.\nFirst there is a field with treasure\nhidden in it which a man buys, hav\ning sold ail that he had in order to\nbuy it (verse 44». This cannot repre\nsent the sinner obtaining salvation,\nfor salvation cannot be bought. It is\nwholly and only of free grace. Neither\nmoney nor good works can obtain it.\nAnd where is there even a hint that\nsalvation is to be hidden? is it not\nrather to be proclaimed to all people?\nLet us hold fast the teaching of the\nprevious parables and ail will be clear\nand easy. The field is the world, and\n.there is only one who can buy it, and\nit is written of Him that, though He\nwas rich, for our sakes He became\npoor. Why should ne need to buy it\nor redeem it? Because, although he\ncreated it. He gave it to Adam, and\nAdam mortgaged it to the devil, who\nwas bold enough to say to our Lord\nthat he owned it (Matt, iv, 8, 9). Itom.\nviii, 21; llev. xxii, 3, and other texts\nteach that it shall yet he fully deliv\nered. Ex. xix. 5, and references teach\nus that the treasure is Israel, through\nwhom He will yet bless all nations.\nT\'p to the present, through all this age,\nshe - is a hidden treasure, and few\npreachers make any reference to her\nor look for any future for her, but\nsuch should give heed to .1er. xxxiii,\n21 20; ill, 17; Isa. lxi.\nIn the parable of the pearl It must\nbe the same man who gave up all that\nlie had in order to obtain It. As pearls\nconte from the sea. this pearl must\nrepresent the church gathered from\nthe sea of nations and in due time to\nbe a glorious church, not having spot\nor wrinkle or any such thing, holy and\nwithout blemish (Epb. v. 27)—a per\nfect pearl, but perfect only because\nU!! _ itecl to Dim who purchased her. He\nsa ^ Israel, "Thy beauty was per\ni feet through my comeliness which I\nj had put upon thee" (Ezek. xvi, 14).\nWhen the time of the mvstèrv has\nsr t\nmamtest 5 one " 1l1 nim \' aml ,sr;,el\nshall be manifestly His treasure in the\ne - V03 of a!! nations. While the parable\nof the not may have some reference\nto the gathering at the end of the age,\nwe must remember that He said to\nsome of Ilis first followers, "Follow\nme, and I will make you fishers, of\nmen" (Matt. iv. 19). Through all the\nage the not has been gathering good\nand bad, not taking alf the fish in the\nsea and not gathering only the good\nones, but gathering of every kind, a\n|\nj\nI\ni\nI\n^\nj en d of the age. Some consider verses\n| yj and 52 au additional parable.\n!\nBoomerang Kinks.\nThere are a good many "kinks" to be\nlearned to throw the boomerang skill\nfully. One is always to throw against\nthe wind if you want it to come back\nto you. It is a miniature aeroplane,\nfor it literally sails against the wind\nand is borne upward and onward by\nthe breeze. If the player wants t<>\nmake a long distance straightaway\nrecord he can throw with the wind,\nbut he must take care to select a\nboomerang which is heavy—so heavy\nthat it will not be too much affected\nby the air currents. By pointing the\nboomerang at a certain angle lie can\nmake it soar aloft in circles like a\nhawk fintil it may lie as high as I \'\nfeet above the earth. As in golf play\ning. it is not so much mere streng\nthat- makes a long thrower, but t\'i\nskill in aiming, the direction and in\nboomerang throwing the way in whi It\nadvantage may be taken of the air\ncurrents.—St. Nicholas.\nThe Value of His Time\nYoung physicians in the smaller\ntowns have an ittoa that appearing\nvery busy, will be > them greatly in\nstarting a practice.

When we\nlook up at the stars they appear to be\nvery still and peaceful, but astrono\nmers know that such is not the ctv-\'e.\nbut that each one is moving, some\nwith incredible speed, invisible to the\nunaided eye, yet visible to the instru\nments at their disposal. Our sun, for\niustance, which is nothing more or\nless than one of the "stars" supposed\nto be "fixed." is moving along, with\nthe entire solar system, toward a point\nin the constellation Hercules. In na\nture, from the most insignificant gerc.\nto the largest world, everything is in\nperpetual motion.\nThe Maid\'s Chance.\n"Do you ever lose that umbrella of\nyours?" asked the maiden.\n"No; I don\'t," replied the man stern\nly.
