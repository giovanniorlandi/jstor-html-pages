One reason for the variation can \nbe traced to the level of economic development for a particular economy in a particular time \nperiod. For example, developed economies rely more on high value-added industrial and services \nsectors to generate employment and income, whereas developing economies rely more on \nagriculture and natural resource extraction to generate employment and income. Residents in \ndeveloped economies generally enjoy a higher standard of living than residents in developing \neconomies. And because there is a lot of catching up to do (e.g., many “need” gaps in developing \neconomies that require closing—infrastructure, critical services, and availability of consumer \ndurables), developing economies, when they get their acts together, tend to experience faster \neconomic growth than developed economies. As an economy matures and its residents reach a \nhigh standard of living, its growth rate tends to fall to the level experienced in other developed \neconomies.  \n \nAnother reason for some of the variations in economic performance between countries \nand over time is the result of economic policy. Some countries, as a matter of policy, are more \nopen to international trade and international investment, whereas others put up more barriers to \nlimit international trade (e.g., import duties) and international investment (e.g., limits on foreign \ninvestments). For countries that are more open, the growth in international trade and foreign \ninvestments can contribute significantly to economic growth.  \n \nA third reason for some of the variation in economic performance between countries and \nover time is the intensity of investment. Some economies, often rapidly growing developing \neconomies, devote a large proportion of their GDP to investment—to build plants, purchase \nequipment, and construct bridges and highways—to increase the stock of capital available for the \nproduction of goods and services.  \n \nOf course, there are many other reasons for observed variations in reported economic \nperformance. Political stability is important for economic development. Investors would not \nwant to undertake long-term projects in an economy if they expected a civil war to break out in \nthe near future. The efficiency of economic institutions is also important. Developed economies \n', 'UVA-BP-0510 \n \n-2- \nin general have better and more stable economic institutions that protect private property rights \nand enhance (through appropriate regulations) the functioning of markets. Developed economies \ntherefore are more stable. Thanks to sound central banking and fiscal discipline, developed \neconomies generally have stable prices or low inflation rates, and their growth rates fluctuate \nfrom one year to the next in narrower bands. Developing economies that improve their economic \ninstitutions often experience faster growth as investors, entrepreneurs, and local talents become \nmore confident about making long-term bets.  \n \nThose differences in economic performance and their underlying reasons are often \nreflected in published economic statistics and can be highlighted through the use of rates and \nratios.  \n \nExhibit 1 presents indicators of economic performance in percentage form computed \nfrom U.S. economic data for selected years. The data file, UVA-BP-0510X, which accompanies \nthis case, gives economic performance indicators between 1990 and 2008 for six other \neconomies around the world—two developed economies (Germany and Japan) and four \ndeveloping economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China, or BRICs as it is now called). But in the \ndata file, the names of six economies are disguised: Data for the six economies are labeled \nEconomy 1 to 6. Exhibit 2 lists the formulas used to compute the rates and the ratios listed in \nExhibit 1 and in the data file.  \n \nStudy the data provided in the spreadsheet. Your assignment is to match the data for each \neconomy with one of six economies: Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, or Russia. A \ncollection of brief overviews of the six economies and of the U.S. economy is provided below. \nBe prepared to give the reasons for your pairings, citing the statistics that seem to be consistent \nwith the characteristics of the economy you selected. Ours is not a perfect world, however, and \nfor our discussion, it would be helpful if you would also identify those pieces of data that seem \nto contradict the pairings you have made. \n \n \nOverviews of Seven Economies \n \nThe overviews were compiled based on information accessed online in August 2006 and \nOctober 2009 from the CIA World Factbook.1 Analysts at the CIA wrote brief overviews of \nevery economy using a variety of economic statistics, not all of which are included in the data \nfile. But the key economic indicators in the data file are the basic facts that the analysts used to \nform their opinions.  \n \nBrazil  \n \nCharacterized by large and well-developed agricultural, mining, manufacturing, \nand service sectors, Brazil’s economy outweighs that of all other South American \ncountries and Brazil is expanding its presence in world markets. From 2003 to \n                                                 \n1 https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html (accessed November 3, 2009). \n', 'UVA-BP-0510 \n \n-3- \n2007, Brazil ran record trade surpluses…Productivity gains coupled with high \ncommodity prices contributed to the surge in exports. Brazil improved its debt \nprofile in 2006 by shifting its debt burden toward real [Brazilian currency] \ndenominated and domestically held instruments. Lula da Silva restated his \ncommitment to fiscal responsibility by maintaining the country’s primary surplus \nduring the 2006 election…Brazil’s debt achieved investment grade status early in \n2008, but the government’s attempt to achieve strong growth while reducing the \ndebt burden created inflationary pressures. For most of 2008, the Central Bank \nembarked on a restrictive monetary policy to stem these pressures. Since the onset \nof the global financial crisis in September, Brazil’s currency and its stock \nmarket—Bovespa—have significantly lost value, –41% for Bovespa for the year \nending 30 December 2008... \n \nChina \n \nChina’s economy during the past 30 years has changed from a centrally planned \nsystem that was largely closed to international trade to a more market-oriented \neconomy that has a rapidly growing private sector and is a major player in the \nglobal economy…In recent years, China has re-invigorated its support for leading \nstate-owned enterprises in sectors it considers important to “economic security,” \nexplicitly looking to foster globally competitive national champions. After \nkeeping its currency tightly linked to the U.S. dollar for years, China in July 2005 \nrevalued its currency by 2.1% against the U.S. dollar and moved to an exchange \nrate system that references a basket of currencies. Cumulative appreciation of the \nrenminbi against the U.S. dollar since the end of the dollar peg was more than    \n20% by late 2008, but the exchange rate has changed little since the onset of the \nglobal financial crisis. The restructuring of the economy and resulting efficiency \ngains have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in GDP since 1978... The \nrapid growth was fueled in part by massive investments. On average, China has \ninvested 35% of GDP. Household consumption has accounted for less than 45% \nof GDP…In late 2008, as China commemorated the 30th anniversary of its \nhistoric economic reforms, the global economic downturn began to slow foreign \ndemand for Chinese exports for the first time in many years. The government \nvowed to continue reforming the economy and emphasized the need to increase \ndomestic consumption in order to make China less dependent on foreign exports \nfor GDP growth in the future. \n \nGermany \n \nThe German economy—Europe’s largest—began to contract in the second quarter \nof 2008 as the strong euro, high oil prices, tighter credit markets, and slowing \ngrowth abroad took their toll on Germany’s export-dependent economy. At just   \n1% in 2008, GDP growth is expected to be negative in 2009. Recent stimulus and \nlender relief efforts will make demands on Germany’s federal budget and \n', 'UVA-BP-0510 \n \n-4- \nundercut plans to balance its budget by 2011. Structural rigidities in the labor \nmarket—including strict regulations on laying off workers and the setting of \nwages on a national basis—have made unemployment a chronic problem. The \nreforms launched by the former government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, \ndeemed necessary due to chronically high unemployment and low average growth, \nled to strong growth in 2007, while unemployment in 2008 fell below 8%, a new \npost-reunification low. Germany’s aging population, combined with high chronic \nunemployment, has pushed social security outlays to a level exceeding \ncontributions, but higher government revenues from the cyclical upturn in 200607\nand a 3% rise in the value-added tax cut Germany’s budget deficit to within \nthe EU’s 3% debt limit in 2007... The modernization and integration of the eastern \nGerman economy—where unemployment still exceeds 30% in some \nmunicipalities—continues to be a costly long-term process, with annual transfers \nfrom west to east amounting to roughly $80 billion. While corporate restructuring \nand growing capital markets have set strong foundations to help Germany meet \nthe longer-term challenges of European economic integration and globalization, \nGermany’s export-oriented economy has proved a disadvantage in the context of \nweak global demand. \n \nIndia \n \nIndia’s diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern \nagriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude of \nservices. Services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for more \nthan half of India’s output with less than one third of its labor force. Slightly more \nthan half of the work force is in agriculture, leading the United Progressive \nAlliance (UPA) government to articulate a rural economic development program \nthat includes creating basic infrastructure to improve the lives of the rural poor \nand boost economic performance. The government has reduced controls on \nforeign trade and investment. Higher limits on foreign direct investment were \npermitted in a few key sectors, such as telecommunications. However, tariff \nspikes in sensitive categories, including agriculture, and incremental progress on \neconomic reforms still hinder foreign access to India’s vast and growing market. \nPrivatization of government-owned industries remains stalled and continues to \ngenerate political debate; populist pressure from within the UPA government had \nrestrained needed initiatives. The economy has posted an average growth rate of \nmore than 7% in the decade since 1997, reducing poverty by about 10 percentage \npoints. India achieved 9.6% GDP growth in 2006, 9.0% in 2007, and 6.6% in \n2008, significantly expanding manufactures through late 2008. India also is \ncapitalizing on its large numbers of well-educated people skilled in the English \nlanguage to become a major exporter of software services and software workers. \nStrong growth combined with easy consumer credit, a real estate boom, and fastrising\ncommodity prices fueled inflation concerns from mid-2006 to August 2008. \nRising tax revenues from better tax administration and economic expansion \n', 'UVA-BP-0510 \n \n-5- \nhelped New Delhi make progress in reducing its fiscal deficit for three straight \nyears before skyrocketing global commodity prices more than doubled the cost of \ngovernment energy and fertilizer subsidies. The ballooning subsidies, amidst \nslowing growth, brought the return of a large fiscal deficit in 2008. In the long run, \nthe huge and growing population is the fundamental social, economic, and \nenvironmental problem. \n \nJapan \n \nIn the years following World War II, government-industry cooperation, a strong \nwork ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense \nallocation (1% of GDP) helped Japan advance with extraordinary speed to the \nrank of second most technologically powerful economy in the world after the U.S.. \nToday, measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, Japan is the thirdlargest\neconomy in the world after the U.S. and China. Two notable characteristic \nof the post-war economy were the close interlocking structures of manufacturers, \nsuppliers, and distributors, known as keiretsu, and the guarantee of lifetime \nemployment for a substantial portion of the urban labor force. Both features are \nnow eroding under the dual pressures of global competition and domestic \ndemographic change. Japan’s industrial sector is heavily dependent on imported \nraw materials and fuels. A tiny agricultural sector is highly subsidized and \nprotected, with crop yields among the highest in the world. Usually self-sufficient \nin rice, Japan imports about 60% of its food on a caloric basis. Japan maintains \none of the world’s largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global \ncatch. For three decades, overall real economic growth had been spectacular—a \n10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the \n1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s, averaging just 1.7%, largely \nbecause of the after effects of inefficient investment and an asset price bubble in \nthe late 1980s that required a protracted period of time for firms to reduce excess \ndebt, capital, and labor. In October 2007 Japan’s longest post-war period of \neconomic expansion ended after 69 months and Japan entered into recession in \n2008, with 2009 marking a return to near 0% interest rates…[A] sharp downturn \nin business investment and global demand for Japan’s exports in late 2008 pushed \nJapan further into a recession. Japan’s huge government debt, which totals 170% \nof GDP, and the aging of the population are two major long-run problems… \n \nRussia \n \nRussia ended 2008 with GDP growth of 5.6%, following 10 straight years of \ngrowth averaging 7% annually since the financial crisis of 1998. Over the last six \nyears, fixed capital investment growth and personal income growth have averaged \nabove 10%, but both grew at slower rates in 2008. Growth in 2008 was driven \nlargely by non-tradable services and domestic manufacturing, rather than exports. \nDuring the past decade, poverty and unemployment declined steadily and the \n', 'UVA-BP-0510 \n \n-6- \nmiddle class continued to expand. Russia also improved its international financial \nposition…since 2000. Foreign exchange reserves grew from $12 billion in 1999 \nto almost $600 billion by end July 2008…Total foreign debt is almost one-third of \nGDP…The global crisis also affected Russia’s banking system, which faced \nliquidity problems. Moscow responded quickly in early October 2008, initiating a \nrescue plan of over $200 billion that was designed to increase liquidity in the \nfinancial sector, to help firms refinance foreign debt, and to support the stock \nmarket. The government also unveiled a $20 billion tax cut plan and other safety \nnets for society and industry. Meanwhile, a 70% drop in the price of oil since \nmid-July further exacerbated imbalances in external accounts and the federal \nbudget. In mid-November, mini-devaluations of the currency by the Central Bank \ncaused increased capital flight and froze domestic credit markets, resulting in \ngrowing unemployment, wage arrears, and a severe drop in production. Foreign \nexchange reserves dropped to around $435 billion by end 2008, as the Central \nBank defended an overvalued ruble…Corruption, lack of trust in institutions, and \nmore recently, exchange rate uncertainty and the global economic crisis continue \nto dampen domestic and foreign investor sentiment. Russia has made some \nprogress in building the rule of law, the bedrock of a modern market economy, \nbut much work remains on judicial reform... \n \nUnited States  \n \nThe U.S. has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in the world, \nwith a per capita GDP of $46,900. In this market-oriented economy, private \nindividuals and business firms make most of the decisions, and the federal and \nstate governments buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private \nmarketplace. U.S. business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts \nin Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off \nsurplus workers, and to develop new products. At the same time, they face higher \nbarriers to enter their rivals’ home markets than foreign firms face entering U.S. \nmarkets. U.S. firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances, \nespecially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military equipment; their \nadvantage has narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology \nlargely explains the gradual development of a “two-tier labor market” in which \nthose at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of \nthose at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay raises, health \ninsurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all the gains in \nhousehold income have gone to the top 20% of households. The war in MarchApril\n2003 between a U.S.-led coalition and Iraq, and the subsequent occupation \nof Iraq, required major shifts in national resources to the military…Soaring oil \nprices between 2005 and the first half of 2008 threatened inflation and \nunemployment, as higher gasoline prices ate into consumers’ budgets. Imported \noil accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. consumption. Long-term problems \ninclude inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical \n', 'UVA-BP-0510 \n \n-7- \nand pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and \nstagnation of family income in the lower economic groups. The merchandise trade \ndeficit reached a record $819 billion in 2007 and $821 billion in 2008. The global \neconomic downturn, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, investment bank failures, \nfalling home prices, and tight credit pushed the United States into a recession by \nmid-2008. To help stabilize financial markets, the U.S. Congress established a \n$700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October 2008. The \ngovernment used some of these funds to purchase equity in U.S. banks and other \nindustrial corporations. In January 2009 the U.S. Congress passed and President \nBarack Obama signed a bill providing an additional $787 billion fiscal stimulus—\ntwo-thirds on additional spending and one-third on tax cuts—to create jobs and to \nhelp the economy recover. \n', 'UVA-BP-0510 \n \n-8- \nExhibit 1 \nRATES AND RATIOS TELL A STORY \nU.S. Economic Performance Indicators (LCU = Local Currency Unit or U.S. Dollars) \n \n1991 2003\nGross Domestic Product\nNominal GDP growth rate (%) 3.30 4.95\nReal GDP growth rate (%) -0.19 3.06\nGDP Components\nHousehold final consumption expenditure (constant LCU)\nGrowth rate (%) 0.17 3.26\nPercent of GDP (%) 67.86 71.21\nGross capital formation (constant LCU)\nGrowth rate (%) -6.39 3.69\nPercent of GDP (%) 14.38 18.63\nChanges in inventories (constant LCU)\nPercent of GDP (%) -0.01 0.00\nGross fixed capital formation (constant LCU)\nGrowth rate (%) -5.05 4.42\nPercent of GDP (%) 14.39 18.62\nGeneral government final consumption expenditure (constant LCU)\nGrowth rate (%) 0.67 3.20\nPercent of GDP (%) 18.50 15.11\nExports of goods and services (constant LCU)\nGrowth rate (%) 6.62 1.93\nPercent of GDP (%) 8.37 9.99\nImports of goods and services (constant LCU)\nGrowth rate (%) -0.56 4.44\nPercent of GDP (%) 8.57 15.01\nStatistical discrepancies \nPercent of GDP (%) -0.53 0.08\nContributions by Sectors \nAgriculture, value added (constant LCU)\nGrowth rate (%) 1.68 8.46\nPercent of GDP (%) 1.03 1.07\nIndustry, value added (constant LCU)\nGrowth rate (%) -4.02 3.29\nPercent of GDP (%) 22.05 21.22\nManufacturing, value added (constant LCU)  \nGrowth rate (%)  4.65\nPercent of GDP (%) 15.11\nServices, etc., value added (constant LCU)\nGrowth rate (%) 0.63 2.94\nPercent of GDP (%) 71 71\nPrice Indices\nConsumer price index (2000 = 100) 79.09 106.83\nInflation rate (% increase in CPI) 4.23 2.27\nGDP deflator 0.84 1.06\nInflation rate (% increase in GDP deflator) 3.50 1.84\nUnemployment, total (% of total labor force) 6.80 6.00  \n \nData source: World Development Indicators, 2006. \n', 'UVA-BP-0510 \n \n-9- \nExhibit 2 \nRATES AND RATIOS TELL A STORY \nCommon Rates and Ratios \n \n \nA.
