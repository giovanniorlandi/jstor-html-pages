Business\nis to be revived and labor is to be\nrewarded.\nAlready the tlrst number of the\nprogram of a new administration\nis announced—"restore the Pay\nne-Aldrich tariff." They pro\npose to "rescue our perishing in\ndustries." They are already\ncounting on "a large increase in\nduties all along the line." Of\ncourse it will raise prices and in\ncrease the cost of living. The\nconsumer will have to pay the\npiper. But what of that? We\nmust have "prosperity" at any\nprice.\nIt is the religion of the story\nthat he who "disturbs business"\ncommits the unpardonable sin.\nIf it will but furnish employment\nto labor at a scant living wage,\novergrown business, swaggering,\nand brutal, shall have license to\ndestroy competition, establish\nrnonoply, violate the law, intimi\ndate justice, corrupt government,\ndestrop democracy, and set up in\nits place industrial and commer\ncial despostism.\nAnd the Wilson administration\nhas been "disturbing business."\nIts principal offense is that it has\nreduced the tariff.\nThat there should be some bus\niness disturbance following a re\nduction of the high tariff duties\nwas inevitable. That much of\nthe depression was artificial can\nnot be disputed. Does any ra\ntional human being doubt that the\ntariff interests would light to the\nlast ditch to maintain their un\nlawful profits? They had many\ntimes warned the public that it\nwould be unsafe to interfere with\nthem. It was an open boast of\nslandpat statesmen at the begin\nning of the tariff session under\nthe present administration that\n"the protected interests would\nmake the American people pay\ndearly for their folly in the elec\ntion of 1912; that when a few\nmillion laborers had bteen laid\noff, and the balance had suffered\na cut in their wages; that when\nthe banks reduced the credit line\nand people were made to feel the\npinch, they would be eager to\nbring Aldrich and Gannon back\nand beg them to make the wheels\ngo round,"\nThe interests could afford to\ntake a small present loss on a\nmanufactured depression to re\nstore their privileges on rnonoply\nand huge profits for another long\nhigh-tariff period.\nAnd so we have had our sea\nson of "business depression"—\na small measure of it the logical\nresult of tariff changes necessary\nduring the period of readjust\nment from the false, artificial, in\nflated bases to a sound, honest,\nstaple basis of actual values.\nThere was no reason for a busi\nness depression or a radical or\ngeneral character.\nDemocratic tariff duties on the\nschedule of manufactures, with\nthe exception of some of the more\nhighly finished products, accord\ned to those industries a fair\nmeasure of protection against\nforeign competition. On wool\nand sugar and most of the pro\nducts of agriculture, the cut was\nunwarranted. For the most part\nit is true that the farmer cannot\nbe materially benefited by tariff\nduties upon his products; but up\non many things grown upon the\nfarm, he has foreign competi\ntion maintained under conditions\nwhich entitle him to the same\nnruasure of protection accorded\nto the American manufacturer.\nThis he did not receive in the\ndemocratic tariff bill. But on\nthe whol the bill s a PROTECT\nIVE TARIFF MEASURE!, and in\nfinitely better and fairer to the\nAmerican people than the Payne\nAldrich law.\nThe investigations of Taft\'s\nCARLTON\'S\ngtart the new year right by trading with us We have\nthe goods you need and our treatment is right, and our\ndeliveries are prompt.\nWe bid for your business solely on the merit of our goods\nand treatment to you.\nCARLTON\'S\nThe store that sa^es\nyou money. Phone 116\ntariff board proved beyond dis\npute that many favored indus\ntries we\'re entrenched behind the\ntariff duties of the Payne-Aldrich\nlaw, ranging from\nand 300 per cent more than "the\ndifference between the cost of\nproduction at home and abroad."\nNo such tariff monstrosity can\nover be maintained,\ncontribute to the political suc\ncess of a few senators and mem\nbers of congress from pro-tariff\nstales to contend, for such legis\nlation. But it is supreme folly\nfor great industries to hope to\nestablish business, stability and\nreal prosperity on a basis of in\njustice and wrong.\nRemember 1908, 1910 and 1912\nLike conditions produce like re\nsults, Let that not be forgotten.\nROBERT M. LA FOLLETTE\n100 to 200\nIt may\n1\nTHE AMERICAN WAR HYSTERIA\nAdmiral Fletcher told the con\ngressional committee that the.\nUnited Stales navy is more of\nllciont than any other navy in the\nworld except that of England and\nthat even in the case of England\neur navy would be able to hold its\nown in its own waters, but prob\nably not in English waters or\nabroad. He further declared that\nthe navy was at the lime he was\ntestifying ready tor sea within a\nweek, but that some of it, in case\nwar should be declared, could pul\nout upon the very day of such\ndeclaration of war, some of the\nvessels the next day, and others\nthe third, while the whole of it\nIcould be busy within a week.\nThe truth of the matter seems\nto be that there is a good deal of\nhysteria being shown relative to\nthe European war. Either that,\nor there is a whole lot of cheap\npolitical buncombe being indulg\ned in.\nWhy this sudden alarm lest\nI he American army and the Am\nerican navy should be unprepared\nfor war? As has been shown,\nnot once but several times of late\nour nation has expended more\nmoney than any other nation ex\ncept England, buv not excepting\nGermany, in building up a navy\nand this expenditure has been ex\npended over a long »cries of\nyears ; why this sudden great anx\niety at this particular lime when\nwe, of all peoples upon the earth,\nshould thrust thoughts of war\nfarlherest from us?\nWe have read much that has\nbeen said upon this subject, yet\nwe have not seen the slightest\nreason given which causes us to\nbelieve that this nation should\nexpend one cent more this year\nfor army and navy purposes than\nwo have been spending year after\nyear. Let there be appropria\ntions made for the usual number\nof war ships, torpedo boats, sub\nmarines and other instruments\nof water warfare and let there be\nthe usual appropriation made for\nthe land forces. tfeyond that it\nseems to us not the slightest rea\nson exists for agitation or dis\nturbance of the public mind.\nMoreover, what nation may\nknow when Its navy is prepared\nfor wart\nA nation may be prepared one\nyear, or one mimne, and be en\ntirely unprepared the next year,\nor the next minute. New in\nventions of destruction are being\nmade nearly every day which ren\nder the millions spent the day be\nfore practically valueless. We\nall know that even in the past\nthe very best vessels built be\ncome antiquated and valueless\nwithin live to ten years. The\nbattleship Idaho gives the people\nof this stale an example of this.\nAlmost before the slate had paid\nthe bill for the silver service pro\nvided for the vessel, announce\nment was made that it had be\ncome so antiquated and useless\nfor the American navy that it had\nbeen sold to Greece, and now a\nnew Idaho is being built, greater\nand more modern than any other\nbattleship now afloat. But how\nlong will this new American\ndreadnaught fill the requirements\nof the future? No one can tell.\nThe $16,000,000 that this new\nwar machine will cost may even\nbefore It is launched be made\nworthless by a new engine of de\nstruction just invented by Max\nii)i which can be pul afloat at less\nthan one-twenty-fourth the cost\nof the new Idaho.\nThis new\nMaxim gun will discharge a suf\nficient quantity of gun cotton that\nif the charge shall fall within 50\nfeet of its mark, it would sink any\nbattleship ever built, so it is now\nclaimed.\nAnd not only that, but\nthe new engine can shoot at such\na distauce that it can select its\nown vantage ground and do its\nwork in entire safety—out of\nsight and even out of hearing of\nits target.\nLet\'s keep cool heads and\nsteady nerves and not be plunged\ninto useless expenditures, or per\nhaps, worse, an unnecessary\nbloody conflict.\nNOTICE FOR PUBLICATION.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE IN\nTERIOR, UNITED STATES LAND\nOFFICE, Coeur d\'Alene, Idaho,\nDec. 3, 1914.\nNotice is hereby given that the\nSanta Fe Pacific Railroad Com\npany by F.

Time after time he\nworked Gunderson into danger\nous positions but had not the\nstrength to pin his shoulders to\nthe mat. Barber worked on the\noffensive most of the lime in the;\nfirst period of the bout, Gunder\nson taking his time and working\ncarefully for the first 25 minutes.\nGunderson\'s showing and re-,\nturn to form is remarkable con-,\nsidering that he lias been out of\nthe game for nearly a year and\nthere is no doubt but what lit\' is\nmuch better now than when he\nretired almost a year ago. 11 e is\nfaster than he over was before\nand is much stronger and the\ngeneral opinion is that he is now\nmore than a match for any of the\nwrestlers in this section. An\nattempt will be made to match\nhim with Doctor Roller, the\nSeattle heavyweight who is tour\ning the country meeting all com\ners, in the near future.
