Gaynor died\non the steamer Baltic in midocean\nat 1 o\'clock Wednesday afternoon,\naccording to a cablegram received\nin New York.\nAews ot his ucalu came in a\nmessage sent hy wireless and ca\nblc to Robert Adamson, his secre\ntary, by Rufus W. Gaynor, his\nson, who sailed with him. The\nmessage read as follows:\n"Father died Wednesday at 1\no\'clock, due to heart failure. No\ntify mother."\nMayor Gaynor sailed away from\nNew York, a fast failing man, on\nthe morning of September 4. An\nhour before he sailed. \' but one\nman, his secretary, knew of his\nplans outside of members of his\nimmediate family. The Mayor\'s\nannounced purpose was a brief va\ncation on the ocean. He felt that\nthe tonic effect of the \' salt air\nwould restore him in some meas\nure to health.\nThe Baltic arrived at Queens\ntown Friday. The Mayor died ns\nshe was nearing the other side.\nThe news of his death was sent by\nwireless to Cuxhaven by Rufus W.\nGaynor, and relayed from Cuxha\nven to New York by cable.\nLacking details of the manner\nof the Mayor\'s death, his friends\nbelieved that the heart attack spo\nken of in Rufus Gaynor\'s cable\ngram, was brought on by a return\nof the coughing fits that had re\ncurred at intervals since he was\nshot.\nAlthough the Mayor had no\nprestiment that his trip would end\nfatally, he had ut different times\nwithin the last year or two told\nhis secretary that the violence of\nthese attacks were a great strain\non his heart, and he feared at\nsome time or other one might re\nsult seriously.\nII.

A large number of\nginseng "(arms" were started. A\nfew of them survive, but most of\nthem have gone the way of all\nthe earth. Only twenty-five farms\nreported ginseng when the Federal\ncensus was taken in l\'JIO and the\nvalue of their entire orodutt was\nless than $4,000.\nIt is evident from the census\'\nfigures that Kentucky farmers are\nnot getting rich very rapidly on\nginseng and that very few of\nthem, in fact, are cultivating it.\nThe ginseng idea, however, is\nbtill rampant in some other sec\ntions of the country, and the Uni\nted States Department of Agri\nculture recently issued u bulletin\non the subject which gives some\nvaluable advice.\nPlunging in ginseng, the bullo\ntin says, is as likely to prove dis\nastrous as in other forms of enter\nprise. The suggestion is offered\nthat culture of any special crop, is\nbest begun in an inexpensive and\nexperimental manner, "enlarging\ntho equipment only as reasonable\nsuccess seems assured." As u\ncommercial product the Agricult\nural Department regards ginseng\nas particularly liable to overpro\nduction. The belief also is ex\npressed that it holds out "little\n\'inducement for inexperienced\ngrowers looking for quick profits\nfrom a small investment."\nThis is not very encouraging to\npersons who uro disposed to, look\nupon ginseng growing as u get-rich-quick\ngame. As a matter of\nfact ginseng is a slow grower and\nits cultivation involves a largo\namount of labor and patience.\n.\nHuman character is like fruits\nand vegetables in that tho soonest\nripe is generally soonest rotten\nand those that are slowest in at\ntaining perfection are longest in\neeping it.\nA NOVEL WTMMKrTlifi\nDr. Ncwarl Ctwtaiy Mikes a\nSpecial Price.\nThe Dr. Howard Company, has\nentered into an arrangement with\nW. S. Lloyd, druggist, by which a\nspecial introductory offer will be\nmade of 25 cents on the 50 cent\nsize of their celebrated specific for\ntne cure of constipation and dys\npepsia. Headaches, coated tongue, diz\nziness, gas on the stomach, specks\nbefore the eyes, constipation and\nal forms of malaria and liver\ntrouble are soon cured by this\nscientific medicine.\nMr. Lloyd has been able to se\ncure only a limited supply, so ev\neryone who wishes to be cured of\ndyspepsia or constipation should\ncall upon him \'at once or send him\n25 cents by mail, and get 60 doses\nof the best medicine ever made,\non this special half price introduc\ntory offer, with his personal guar\nantee to refund the money if the\nspecific does not cure.\nGet our prices on fruit jars nnd\ncans. Vanarsdell & (Jo.\nImpeachment of Sulzer Regular.\nJustice Hashbrouck, of the State\nSupreme Court, has decided that\nGov. Sulzer was regularly im\npeached and while awaiting im\npeachment trial was divested of the\nright to exercisehis executive func\ntions, including the power to par\ndon.\nThe question of the legality of\nSulzer\'s impeachment came before\nJustice Hashbrouck in connection\nwith habeas corpus proceedings\nbrought to compel the New York\nCity authorities to honor liov.\nSulzer\'s pardon of Joseph G. Rob\nin, the banker convict. He decided\nthat Robin\'s pardon was invalid,\nquashed the writ and sent Robin\nback to prison at Blackwell\'s Is\nland. ECZEMA THAT SPREADS.\nHow a Pouchkeepsle, N.

Dr. Chester of Nashville, who\nwhife evangelizing in Arkansas in\nhis younger dnys, had become fnmil\niar with the easy amble of the long\neared American species, was induced\nto make trial of \'the Chinese typo\nduring a visit to China a few yenrs\nngo. His experience was disappoint\ning. The gait was a rough, insuffer\nable jog, and the characteristic bray\nwas a painful phenomenon in the\nrealm of sound. Dr. Chester reports\nhis impressions as follows :\n"The power of heredity, working\nthrough millenniums of isolation,\nwith no modification from foreign\nadmixture, has developed in the brny\nof the Chinese donkey a quality of\nits own. There are no words in Eng\nlish to describe the heart-rending pa\nthos of it. It was as if an appeal\nto heaven ngainst the cruelty and op\npression of ages were nt Inst finding\nutterance in one long, loud, undulat\ning wail.

McKEE\nONE OF THE DUTIES OF CITIZENSHIP.\nTuesday, October, 7th, is Registration Day and every voter of\nthe city, who is here between the hours of C a. ra., and 9 p. m., unless\nprevented by sickness, must register, in order to be allowed to vote\nduring the ensuing year.\nEvery year a nurabe\'r or citizens lose their right to vote by going\nto the Lexington Trots that morning and not registering before leav\ning the city. No Democrat should let anything, except sickness or\nabsence from home during the hours named, prevent him from regis\ntering and our Democratic neighbors should be reminded of this re\nquirement. The right to vote is a sacred duty and failure to exercise that\nprivilege is conclusive evidence of one\'s lack of appreciation of the\nobligations of citizenship.\'\nOUR FIRST MODEL HIGHWAY.\nMontgomery county is not likely to have its first model highway\nearlier than next year, as little-highway construction work can be done\nin the winter, other than the securing of quarry rights, the making of\nmaps, plans and such other detail work of a preparatory character.\nCongressman W. J. Fields did all he could to assist us in securing\ngovernment aid and our citizens are duly appreciative of his efficient\nefforts. It remained, however, for our friend Senator Ollie M. James\nto make the movement a certainty by putting his big shoulder to the\nwheel and while this road has been known- as the Maysville pike\n"since the memory of man runneth not to the contrary," since it is\nthe first highway in Kentucky to receive government aid, when com\npleted, we move that its name be changed to the "Ollie James High\nway."\nTHE HAZELRIGG BIBLE CLASS.\nThe Hazelrigg Bible Class is an organization truly worth while.\nIt is not made up of the long-faced sort, but of manly men, who with\nout professing perfection, want to do something of real benefit, not\nonly for the individual members, but for the community at large.\nThis spirit actuated the arrangement for the coming to our city of the\nRev. Earle Wilfrey, of Washington, D. C. His recent lectures were\nsplendid and every one who heard him is now better by having\' done\nso.\nThis class is pursuing the right course and we expect to see it\nquickly become a potent power for good in our midst; in- fact, wo\nbelieve wo are in keeping with absolute accuracy when wo say it is\nalready such.\nThe work on Maysville street is progressing at the pace set by tho\nproverbial snail.\nBOTH PROPOSITIONS SHOULD CARRY. \' \'\nIf the constitution k amended so as to permit convicts to he work\ned on the public highways of tho State, the taxpayers would receive\nthe benefit of their services and the men would, at the same time, bo\ngiven a more teal thy occupation, while if they continue to be employ;\ncd as now, the contractors and a few grafters reap a harvest from\ntheir labors, while the StHtc supports them. The. people wilj have an\nopportunity to vote on this question this fall and this proposition is\nsecond only ic importance to that calling for the commission plan of\ngovernmcnt.in the county, which directly and vitally affects us locally.\nWe are heartly in favor of both propositions and sincerely hope they\nwill carry by overwhelming majorities.\nJUDGE A.

All such ma\nterial should be scattered on the\nland and now is tho timo to do it.\nTho winter feeding season will\nsoon be here and this means the\naccumulation of a largo amount of\nmanure, which if correctly saved\nand npplicd is exceedingly valua\nble. Every hundred pounds of\nstable manure is worth 10 to 15\ncents, overy ton from $2.00 to\n$3.00. The liquid is more valuable\nthan the solid and should therefore\nbo saved by the use of amplo bedd\ning material.\nImproper handling of manure\nresults in great loss. Careful tests\nhave shown that it loses half its\nvalue in six months if exposed to\ntho weather in tho ordinary ma\nnure pile. Care must be taken to\nprevent heating, leaching and\nwaste of the urine. Most of this\nloss is prevented when stock, such\nas cattle and mules, are fed in\nsheds, the manure being tightly\ncompacted by the tramping of the\nstock, which excludes the air and\nprevents heating, tho urine being\nsaved by abundant bedding, and\ntho sheltered situation preventing\nIt aching by rains.\nOn account of sanitary consider\nations manure can not bo allowed\nthus to accumulate in the dairy\nbarn, in which case it should be\nremoved to a shed or covered pit\nto prevent loss. It pays to pro\nvide such protection for the cow\nmanure, but if the dairyman does\nnot have n shed or pit the manure\nshould not be allowed to accumu\nlate, but should bo regularly haul\ned away and scattered.\nOne advantage of live stock\nfarming is that it furnishes a sup\nply of manure. The stock -farmer\nkeeps most of his farm in grass,\nhay and forage crops, and this\nmeans that the plant food is kept\nin the soil nnd tho land is prevent\ned from washing. Ho carefully\nsaves and applies the manure\nand his land grows more pro\nductive each year. Good crops\ncan not be grown without manur\ning the land in some way either\nby commercial fertilizers, green\nmanure crops, or stable manure,\nand for Kentucky farms stable\nmanure is by far the most profit\nable means of fertilizing.\nThe writer in his own farm\npractice has hauled and scattered\nmany hundreds of loads of stable\nmanure. Aluch or tins was placed\non washed, thin, and gullied lnnd,\nand on this land to-day are grow\ning rank sods of grass.\nKentucky farmers have in the\npast failed sadly in making the\nmost of their stable manure. On\nthousands of farms there are fields\nthat have been cropped for gener\nations without tho application of n\nsingle forkful of manure. With\nproper attention given to fertili\nzation, with stable litter supple\nmented by the rational use o f\nground limestone and ground phos\nphate rock, nnd with good rotation\nsystems the crop yield of the\nstate could be doubled in tho next\ngeneration.\nUndoubtedly our farmers will\nlind this work highly profitable.\nIn a recent uddrcss in Kentucky,\nDr. C. G. Hopkins, of Illinois,\nsaid "There is no investment which\nan honest man can make which\nwill pay so high returns as time\nand money spent judiciously in\nland improvement," and it might\nbe added that is no method of soil\nimprovement available to Ken\ntucky furmors so suro as the haul\ning nnd scattering of stnblo ma\nnure, and now is tho time to do it.-\nW.

On\nAugust 1st an cstinmto was made\nby tho various crop reporters in\nthe State with the hope that rain\nwould fall. Scattered rain did fall\nduring the latter part of August,\nbut thoy wore either not sufficient\nor not soon enough to make the\nfirst of September cstimato of the\ncrops even as h\'gh as the estimate\nof August 1st.\nCorn has dropped to a condition\nof 58.4 per cent, which means but\nlittle more than a half crop. Bur\nley tobacco still remains at 65 per\ncent, but dark tobacco has dropped\nto a condition of 54 per cent. Al\nfalfa is 70 per cent, cow peas 84\nper cent and soy beans 72 per cent\nof tin average crop. The spring\nsown clover shows an average con\ndition of G3 per cent. Tho legu\nminous crops have held their own\nbetter than any other crop during\nthis drouth. Blucgrass is given at\nGO per dent, orchard grass at 62\nper cent and pastures as a whole\nare very inferior.\nLive stock has suffered very ma\nterially on account of short past\nures and scarcity of water. The\ncondition of horses is given at 90\nper cent, cattle 83 per cent, hogs\n85 per cent\' and sheep 92 per cent.\nThe condition of poultry has like\nwise declined. Chickens are given\nas 92 per cent, turkeys 80 per cent\nand ducks 85 percent.\nAll kinds of fruits have deterio\nrated. Apples are small, many\ndropping from tho trqes, and their\ncondition is shown as 67 per cent,\npeaches 74 per cent, plums 58 per\ncent and pears 58 per cent. Gar\nden conditions are deplorable, drop\nping to 44 per cent.\nAbundant rain falls would not\nhelp anything as far as this year\'s\ncrop is concerned. The corn crop\nwould grow worse instead of better\nshould abundant rains fall now;\nthe same is true of tobacco. The\ndanger in the curing period for\ncorn and for tobacco is in huving\nan excessive amount or moisture.\nKninb now would only have u ten\ndency to spoil what is left of these\ntwo crops. Moisture is needed\nvery badly for fall seeding, and\nwould benelit next year\'s crop in\nthis respect. Good rains would\nimprove fall pastures. Water for\nstock is a serious problem in many\nlocalities and many lires are re\nported as a result of the dry\nweather. A match dropped in\npastures in tho condition in which\nthey are at present is almost like\ndropping\' a spark in u powder\nmaguzine. The water supply in\nmany towns in the State has given\nout, and tire losses as a result of\nthe drouth are bound to be great.\nOne hundred and fifteen esti\nmates of tho cost of growing an\nacre of corn show an average csti\nmato of $13.95. Last month\'s es\ntimate of the cost of growing an\nacreof wheat was S10.16. It is\ninteresting to note that the general\nopipion is that it costs $3.79 mote\nto grow an acre of corn tlu\'n an\nacre of wheat. Last year\'s corn\nproduction in Kentucky was 30.4\nluishels per acre. Tho present re\nport would indicate n yield of about\n18 bushels per acre for this year.\nCorn would have to bring about 77\nipnts per bushol on the average,\nbased on this estimate of 513.95,\nto pay the actual cost of production.\nJ.

HOT SHOT FOR OPPOSITION\nMnytvlll Banker Throws Hat Into the\nRing, But Has String Tied to It\nHis Charges Against Management\n\'Answered, and His Record a Friend\nof Groww-s\' Cause Assailed.\nLexington, Ky. In a special dispatch\nfrom Willlamitown, a at aft correspon\ndent of the Lexington Herald says:\n"Ex-Congressman J. N. Kohoo, now a\nllsysvllle banker, whom \'Iloorganlza-\ntlonlsts\' rsoontly besought to bocome\ntheir candidate for the Presidency of\nthe BurUy Tobaoco Company, throw\nhis hat Into the ring hare today. Al\nthough a string was tied to It, the\nfresh-cast tile immediately was sub\njected to a round of kicks calculated\nto batter even a crown. The seat of\nGrant County had been selected by\nbookers as fledgling ground upon\nwhich the prospective candidate could\ntry his wings, their further oourse to\nbe determined by the reception which\nhis platform might recolvo. Judged\nby the onthuslasm of the steering\ncommittee, ho acquitted himself to\ntholr satisfaction.\n"An applause squad of cloven men,\nthe captain of which belabored a ta\nble top with a walking cane, supplied\nnoisy support for Mr. Kehoo\'s periods,\nbut tho moro serious audlenco gave\ngenerous applause to Air. uiarenco\nLeBus and Mr. Fred Stuoy.\nLikes Fit of Candidacy.\n"Bofore he had closed, Mr. Kehoo\nvirtually had declared his candidacy,\nprovided conditions,\nwnlcn included\nnn AfndAmAiit n a in onlnfv WAro fill.\n14 ji..m., ..u u......,,, .. .,..., t..1 ml Ci\nfilled, and he assured his hearers that\na \'nrlflht Leaf ticket for directors\na \'Urignt uoav nonet lor directors\nsoon would bo nnnounced.\n"Mr. Kohoo declared that tho deci\nsion of tho Court of Appeals In the\nStanslfer crso embodied his platform,\nand that \'usurpation of power\' would\nbe the Issue upon which tho contest\nwould be pitched."\nMr. Kehoo\'s criticism of the man\nagement of the Burley Tobaoco Coir\npany was in chief the charge that the\nprovision in the charter for the elec\ntion of officers by individual grower?\nremaining byal to the organization,\nInstead of by tho holders of stock, war\nput thore with the purpose of usurp\nlug rights and of perpetuating men in\noffice.\nAnswered By Mr. Stucy.\nChallenging Mr. Kehoo\'s charges,\nMr. Stucy said In part:\n"Wo sought the beBt legal talent\nthat wo could get. What they advised\nwe followed to the letter. We thought\nthat we had devised the most demo\nrratlc method of government, and that\nIt was legal. We were afraid that in\nthe course it time the American To\nbacco Company might buy up enough\nstock to control tho organization and\nput It out of business, as it had done\nits rivals. That 1b why we Inserted\nIn the charter the provision that al.\nmembers of tho society remaining in\nthe organisation, and not outsider\nwho might buy stock, should control\nits affairs.\n"The management of tho Burley To\nbacco Company has had but ono mo\ntive, and thRt has been to serve the\nbeet Interests of all growers. If what\nhe cites in the decision of the Couri\not Appeals was an error, It was tu\nbest expedient that we could devise\nand was endorsed ly the best legal\ntalent procurable."\nHot Shot From Mr. LeBus,\nThe Impromptu speech of the Prest\ndent of the Burley Tobacco Company\nwab pronounced a masterly effort. He\nsaid in part:\n"I am tired of history. I want to\nlook forward. Your business should go\nforward, and never backward. I wan;\nto deal only with facts. If you have\nquestions to BBk, I will answer all I\ncan now, and stay all night to ant,tf\nmoro rather than go away leaving any\ndoubts In your mind as to the fail tie. r\nwith which your business has I ecu\nmanaged.\n"I see several bankers here. I want\nto read an extract from a letter I havr\nJust recolved. It Is from the I\'resi\ndent of one of the largest banks ol\nLouisville;\n" \'Some of the mombers of the\nboard have noticed, naturally with\nsome concorn, the newspaper re\nports prints, under big headlines,\nand feel that if continued, the in\nternal dlsoord cropping out Is\nbound, In a greater or less degree,\nto hamper tho progress of the\ncompany, and greatly lessen its\nchaxioes of success.\'\nShoulders $73,000 Individually,\n"Now, every man acquainted with\ntbe unwarranted and outrageous at\ntacks made upon this company In the\ncourts well knows to what this bauker\nrefers. Those suits In which the re\nceiver was sought on grounds that\nwere proved to be without foundatiou\nparticularly are to blaruo for this in\njury to tho credit of your business,\n"We owe that bank $80,000, which\nwas used in pushing the brand of to\nbacco which today gives such great\npromise. A note for 130,000 ot this\neuro oamo due a few days ago, and\nthere was hesitation about lta renewal\nI had assured tbe bank that It would\nbe paid by September 1. I believed\nthat It would be paid then, not antici\npating tbe miserable obstacles that\nhave been thrown in our way by ene\nmies. To satisfy tbe back of my en\ntire faith In the stability of this busi\nness and tho oertalnty of Its future, I\nmyself havo signed the\n000.\nnote for 130,-\n"In three banks in Lexington and\none In Cynthiana I am on the com\nrnny\'s paper for 65,000 more. I hav\ntanked your business as an individual\nUoauce I kr.o.\' that It li tound Lo\nWW\nAfed that you are going to win la spite\nI U all difficulties.\nChallenge to Kehoe.\n"Now let\'s forget this hullabaloo\nstirred up by a few complalners and\nget down to brass tacks. Is thore any\nman In this houso who wants to take\nover this liability I have assumed, and\nwith It tho burden In toll and harrasa\nxnont which I havo had to bear? I\nnever sought tho office of Presldont of\nthis concern and I never will. When\nI was persuaded to tako It I made the\nstipulation that I should not receive\na cont except on the condition that\ntho business should succeod. That\nwas my platform. Will Mr. Kohoe\nagreo to work for the company on tho\nsamo conditions? Furthermore, will\nhe agree to work for a salary to be\nfixed by the board, as I did?\n"I wasn\'t hunting a Job. I wasn\'t\nhunting a salary. The first require\nment I would suggest for any man\nproposed for tho head of this busi\nness would be that ho have an inter\nest In It greater than any salary. The\nincreased price on tho 500 acres of\ntobacco I havo grown has far out\nweighed any salary consideration, and\nalso has mado my Interost idontical\nwith those of ovory other grower.\n"Tho flrot troublo this company\novor had camo from Mason County.\nTho county Is not to be blamed for It.\nMr. Kohoe, moro than any man allvo,\nwas responsible. Ho organized a ware\nhouse company. Ho secured the Presi\ndency and had his salary fixed at ?2,\n400 a year.\nExtortion Is Alleged.\n"Then he secured a contract with\nthe county organization by which the\ngrowers had to pay his warehouse\n$1.25 for handling, whether In winter\nor summer order. Tho average cost\nof prizing was 65 oonts. Wo protest\ned against this excesslvo charge, but\nMr. Kehoo stood firm. Records show\nthat his warehouse company received\n?17,000 above the sum paid for hand\nling in Harrison County. This extor\ntion was one of the prime causes of\nthe formation of the Burley Tobacco\nCompany.\n"And about this salary howl. In\n190G Mr. Kehoe rocelved $2,400 for\n3,764 hogsheads handled by his com\npany, and in 1907 ho received the\nsamo sum for 5,026 hogsheads handled\nf\'0\'" ."ul \', v\nMr handled 60,000 and 65,000 hogs\nheads, respectively. According to his\nscale, a salary of $35,000 would have\nbeen paid to tho President of tho Bur\nley Tobacco Sqclety. So much for\nhigh salaries.\nRecord In Service.\n"United we stand and divided we\nfall. Grand motto. If tho majority\nwant Mr. Kehoe, I am always for ma\njority rule. He speaks of what has\nbeen done as \'what we have done.\nWhat has ho been doing since 1908?\nWhat consideration may bo claimed\nby any growor who has hidden In the\nbushes while loyal workers have been\nwhipping tho trust?\n"He did organize a warehouse com\npany, which was sold out to the Louis\nvllle Warehouse Company. I never\nheard of his trying to organize a Bur\nley growers\' warehouse or of his giv\ning any aid or sympathy to thosp\nwarehouses established by the organi\nzation elsewhere. But he did organize\na second warehouse company in Mays\nvllle after the first one had been sold\nout and tried to sell the stock In Bur\ney territory. Also, he\'s a banker, but\nnever have I heard of his growing to\nbacco.\nOfficers Should Know Business.\n"What I want to emphasize is that\ngrowers should select men to conduct\ntheir business who are qualified with\ni nowledge of that business. When 1\na.u sick I want a doctor, and not a\nlawyer or a politician. Mr. Kehoe titu\nspoken of his efforts during the early\nyears ot tnis movement. WSero was\nhe In 1909 aTid 1910 and 1911 and 1912 V\no he has said, I would judge men foi\ntho future by their conduct In the past.\n"I ohallenge any man to show tha\nany memt r of tho board has not\nworked conscientiously and honestly\nand faithfully for the Interests of the\nwhole Industry. If you allow thlt\nbusiness to fall, It can not be restored\nIn a hundred years. Do I want sevej\nor fifteen cents for the tobacco I grow\nDo you want seven or fifteen cents\nfor your tobacco?\nGrowers Not Dissatisfied.\n"As I have paid, I am not a candl\ndate tor any oftice, but when a succes\nhor to ran is caohen 1 want hhn to bo I\nman who know a tiie tobacco buslnes.\nuiid In whose hands my Interests ant.\nthe interests of every grower wll\nbo bate, and. us far as 1 am concerned\nlie can take over all the honors aiiu\ntalary and all the troubles and ilnun\nclal obligations 1 carry.\n"We have goi the best and greates\nindependent factory in the world. N\nbusiness ever started off as smoothlj\nand with greater promise. Are the\ngrowers dissatisfied with It? Blee\nyou, only those who havo been de\ncelved by men who havo resorted tc\nmisrepresentation. The 10 per cent re\nserve Mr, Kehoo now attaoks enabled\nthe company to found this factory and\nbring competition to its own breaks. It\nenablod tho company to protect the\ngrower against excessive handling\ncharges, such is were charged at Mays\nvllle. Wo have established loose leal\nhouses and warehouses all over the dls\ntrlot, to that the farmer could have a\nmarket at home. The proceeds he me:\nIn his own community, patronizing\nhome Institutions. He Is conducting hit\nown business und enjoying the profits.\nArgument Premature.\n"Tho burdon of Mr. Kohoe\'s talk It\ntbe decision of tha Court of Appeals In\nthose Stanslfer Bults. Inasmuch as wc\nare oatltlod to a rehearing, use of till;\nas his chief argument would seem pre\nmature. The manner of voting has con\ntlnued from tbe beginning. Why basn\'\nhe challenged It sooner? He Is verj\nsure it was wrong, ho cays, but ho 1:\nlate Indeed In making it an lssuo.\n"He docries tho public statement\nmado by tho company. Does the Mays\nvlllo Warehouse Company publish n\nof Its affairs to the world? Does th\nbank ot whloh Mr. Kehoo is Presldem\nobserve any limit as to what it elmi;\nglvo out? For all of the shortcoming?\nwhich Mr. Kehoe sees be recommend\nas a remedy that the crowd whom h\npproeenU shall bo put h rcntrol. The\nlait analysis must be that the groweis\'\norganization has only one enemy."\nNOTI\'Cft.\nTO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND\nHOLDERS OF WAREHOUSE RE\nCEIPTS OF THE BURLEY TOBAC\nCO COMPANY OF LEXINGTON,\nKENTUCKY.\nTho stockholders and holdors of\nwarehouso recolpts of tho Burley To\nbacco Company, of Loxlngton, Ken\ntucky, are heroby notified that by or\nder of tho Kenton Circuit Court, Judgo\nF.
