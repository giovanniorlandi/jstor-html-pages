Rheumatism, headaches, liver\ntrouble, nervousness, constipation, dizz\niness, sleeplessness, bladder disorders\noften come from sluggish kidneys.\nThe moment you feel a dull ache in\nthe kidneys or "your back hurts, or if\nthe urine is cloudy, offensive, full of\nsediment, irregular of passage or at\ntended by a sensation of scalding, get\nabout four ounces of Jad Salts from\nany reliable pharmacy and take a table\nspoonful in a glass of water before break\nfast for a few days and your kidneys\nmay then act fine.

The only motive\npower is in its sails, six in all, so\narranged that one man can manipulate\nthem all.

Behind them is a bit of\nmoney and a scrap of paper with some\nscribbling on it, all very significant: 10\nthe Chinese seaman. Without eyes\nhow could the ship r?e in the. dark,\nthe Chinaman reasons.\nThe tale of t! trip is. a stirring one.\nScarcely had Shanghai been left be\nhind when typhoons, seemingly in\nwaiting, swept down upon it. The\n1,200 miles to Hokouate, jn the north\nof Japan, was one continual struggle.\nSix days later, with the weather more\nmoderate, Hakodate was left behind.\nBut the lull proved very ee-nnornrv.\nThe storm king rushed nit from Ilie\neast and south, driving the junk ever\nnorth, until, passing among- the Aleu\ntian islands, it burst into ihe Bohrinp\nsea. Repeatedly the rudder was car\nried away, repaired and swept away\nagain. Half the distance wa,s covered\nwith, jury rudders dragging the vessel\nback! \'Gales and gales succeeded each\nther annoying calms with great\nbreaking swells that tore and smashed\nthe craft about while headway was\nimpossible and gafes that made the\nfrail ship lahor in alarming fashion.\nClosest Shave Near End.\nUnalaska, in the Aleutians, was\nsought for refuge on August 28 and\nleft again on September 1. On this\nlast leg of the voyage they had better\nluck. A fair breeze sent the shin\ndown the coast to Victoria. Only n-t""\nfew hours away from the port, how\never, the huge hulk of a Japanese\nsteamer suddenly \' loomed in the fog\nthreatening. .disaster. -\n"It was the closest shave I\'ve had,"\nsaid Captain Waard.\n. "I could have put my hand on her.\nBut this old junk can spin about like\na tub in her own length and that was\nwhat she did, when the Japanese was\nthree feet away coming closer every\nsecond."\nNow that he is safely on the Pacific\ncoast, Waard Intends to exhibit . his\nstrange ship in every, port on the con\ntinent; from Victoria to Panama, New\nYork to Boston, the St. Lawrence and\nthe Great Lakes.
