Hays,\nin a recent order, calls the attention of\nnewspapers to what is and^what is not\nadvertising in publications entered as\nsecond-class matter whose advertising\nportion is subject to zone rates. Under\nthe law of Oct. 3, 1917, publica\ntions are required to pay a higher rate\nof postage on the portion devoted to\nAdvertisements than on the portion\ndevoted to matter other than adver\ntisements. This is not a new law, but\nthe postinaster genral makes known\nhis purpose to enforce it. The order\nfollows:\nTEXT OF HAYS\' ORDER\n"Hereafter, with respect to publica\ntions entered as second-class matter,\nthe queston as to whether, under the\nlaw of Oct. 3, 1917, requiring a\nhigher rate of postage on the portion\ndevoted to advertisements than on the\nportion devoted to matter other than\nadvertisements, editorial and other\nreading matter if advetising will be\ndecided by whether or not the publish\ner has been, or is to be, directly or in\ndirectly compensated, eiter by inoncy\nor other valuable consideration, for its\ninsertion. In all cases where the pub\nlisher has not been, and is not to be,\ncompensated such matter will take the\nrate of postage for other than adver\ntising. In all cases where the pub\nlisher has been or is to be compensat\ned in any form whatever, the advertis\ning rate of postage will be charged.\nArticles, items and notices in the form\nof reading matter inserted in accord\nance with a custom or understanding,\nexplicit or tacit, that a \'reader\' is to\nbe given tho advertiser or his products\nin the publication in which the display,\nadvortisemnt appears, a rP advertis\ning within the meaning of the law.\n"Display advertising is obvious in\nits character and must pay the adver\ntising mailing rate.\n"DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY\'\'\n"Attention is specifically called to\nthe law of 1912, which requires that\neditorial or other reading matter for\nwhich the publisher is compensated,\ndirectly or indirectly, must be plainly\nmarked with tho word \'Advertise\nment,\' ,,\n"The postmaster general desires it\nto be thoroughly understood by all\npublishers that thin law of 1912 is\nmost vigorously enforced by his de\npartment.\n"This ruling puts it up squarely to\noaeb publisher to label all matter,\nother than display advertisements, for\nthe publication of which money or\nother valuable consideration is paid,\naccepted or promised, with the word\n\' Advertisment\' printed in fall.\n"Finally, in this connection atten\ntion is railed to the fact that when a\nnewspaper or periodical advertises its\nown services or issues, on any other\nhuinoss of the publisher, in the form\nof either display advertisements, or\neditorial or reading matter, this is ad\nvertising within the meaning of the\nlaw, and the publisher must expect to\npay the adverfsing mailing rate there\nfor.\nWILL H.

Somehow the\nprinter happens to forget his quota\ntion marks, and the credit of origi\nnality goes to the writer none the less.\nThe plea is that quoting often Im\nplies sterility and bad taste.
