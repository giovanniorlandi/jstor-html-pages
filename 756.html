It disfigures the\nhorse and is as absurd as the fashion of Berne\nsavage races te put rings in the nose, slit the\nupper lip or tattoo or otherwise disfigure the\nhuman countenance. It is cruel and ought te\nbat placed under the ban of the law somewhat\nas mayhem or human mutilation net endangering\nlife.\nPresident Itoesevolt has rendered a geed ser\nvice in taking a pronounced stand against dock deck\ning horses. In Washington the custom is tabooed\nand there the horse is quite exempt from such\nbarbarity. It is a cockney idea copied from the\naristocratic snobs of England. It net only de\nprives the horse of much of its natural grace,\nbut of his weapon of defense against the flies\nand ether insects which are l5ft free te torture\nhim.

COLLINS\nA Werd Fer the Republican Candi-\ndate Fer County Judge\nJames Marshall Cellins, Republican nomineo\nfor County Judge, was born at Millcreek in this\ncounty 38 years age en a tract of the old Jehn\nMarshall farm, which his father, Jehn Cellins,\nhad then recently bought of Jamea Marshall,\nnew of Washington, for whom our subject was\nnamed. His parents immigrated here from the\nold country in the early half of the lest century,\nwhile two-thirds of Masen county was still\nvirgin forest and before nine-tenths of our\npresent population as yet born. Jim received\nhis early mental training at the parental fire\nside and the old Helena Scheel, for which he\nfrequently express a fondness. Later he at\ntended College at EardHewn and St. Mary\'s,\nnear Lebanon, from which latter institution he\nreceived the Degree of B. S. and A. B. He\nmade his legal course at Georgetown University,\nWashington, D. C, where he was granted tha\nDegree of L. L. M. Having acquired a thorough\nclassical training, he is a man of convictions\nand liberal but vigorous and progressive ideas.\nHe is a lawyer of ability and business tact,\nbeing a geed advocate and safe adviser. He is\nindustrious, of unquestioned integrity, and\ngenial, but firm and camlid, in fact, tee much\nse some have thought, te enter politics, but it\nis well te let the voters determine this, as the\npeople seme times like as their servant a man\nthat they can "put their finger en" as the say\ning Is. If elected te the office te which he\naspires we de net hesitate te say that his con-1\nduct of the office will be clean, fair, safe and\nprogressive.\nMF?1 WH0 - 4 TO DRESS\nIIIJUIV THE FE T WELL\nTarry net by the wayside.
