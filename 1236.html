        <pre>['WENATCHEE DAILY WORLD\nVOL. O. NO. 217.\nRECLAMATION\nIN OKANOGAN\nWorking on Government Project\nThat Will Reclaim Many Acres\nof Fruit Land.\nWork on the government irrigation\nproject in Okanogan which will re\nclaim some 8,000 or 10,000 acres of\nsemi-arid land along the Okanogan\nriver, has been carried on in a small\nway throughout the winter, and now\nthat spring has opened up will be\nprosecuted in earnest. The comple\ntion of this project is looked forward\nto here with keen interest, for it\nmeans the development of a territory\nthat is tributary to Wenatchee and in\nthe prosperity which this place is\nsure to share. The work inaugurated\nby the government last year will be\ncarried on on a larger scale this sea\nson and pushed to as early a comple\ntion a spossible. These government\ntion as possible. These government\nwith a view to permanancy as well\nas early utility. In fact the engineers\nprefer to sacrifice time to gain as\nsurance of durability and an idea of\nthe character of the work is given\nthe following discription of the di\nmensions of the dam taken from the\nRecord printed at Conconully.\n"L. Bergsvik, supervising engineer\nfor the construction of the dam for\nthe government irrigation project at\nPogue flat, arrived in Conconully\nSunday, prepared to begin work. He\nwas accompanied by A. Forsyth, for\nman, and N. Olsen, blacksmith, all of\nwhom expect to remain until the dam\nis completed.\n"We expected to at once begin the\nwork of putting in a concrete gate at\nthe outlet of the lake to replace the\nwooden one now in use," said Mr.\nBergsvik, "but we find there is yet a\nfoot of frost in the ground, and we\ncan not accomplish much until it Is\ngone. We expected to find the sea\nson further advanced than it is. The\ngate will be three feet wide and ten\nfeet high.\n"There will not be much in the way\nof construction on the dam except\npreliminary work until after the\nflood season is past, probably in June.\nAfter that date about fifty teams and\nforty laborers other than teamsters\nwill be employed.\n"The dam, while it presents no dif\nficult engineering problems, will be\nquite large, and an expensive one\nconsidering the acreage to be water\ned. The dam will be 84 feet high,\nwith a slope of three to one toward\nthe resorvoir and two to one from it.\nThe length on top will be 500 feet.\nAt its base the dam will be 420 feet\nwide, and 20 feet wide at the top.\nThe foundation will be solid concrete\nanchored to bed rock. Through th*>\nconcrete foundation a conduit tour\nand a half feet in deameter will be\nbuilt through which the water will\n$3,500\nLot 100x270 feet with bearing 1\norchard and modern dwelling,\nfive blocks from postoffice.\nTerms\n$6,530\nLot 100x270 feet with modern\ndwelling and bearing orchard.\nCost of house $4000. Terms.\nL. V. Wettm\nWENATCHEE, WASHINGTON\nfind its way into the canal. The con\nduit will be constructed so that the\nflow of water can be regulated or en\ntirely shut off at will. A Dove tne\nconcrete work the dam will be dirt\nand rock filling.\n"It is the intention to complete the\ndam this year, Mr. Bergsvik said,\nbut he put on a faraway and dreamy\nlook when asked if he really expected\nto do so."\nColumbia Valley News.\nMottler Bros, are moving their\nferry at Columbia siding to a point\n100 feet down stream. This change\nwas made necessary because of an\neddy that formed at the old landing\non the north side of the river.\nG. B. Clark, who spent the winter\nworking at Cashmere, returned to\nhis ranch at Columbia siding Satur\nday.\nJ. B. Trexler, who is employed by\nthe Wenatchee Fruit Land company\nat Moses Coulee, went to Wenatchee\nSaturday to meet C. F. Klagg and\nson, who with their families, arrived\nfrom Illinois Saturday morning. Mr.\nKlagg and son are to work for the\nWenatchee Fruit Land company, and\nwill be located at Moses Coulee.\nE. A. Wyman and P. L. Gilbert are\nbuilding a two-story house on their\nbig fruit ranch at Moses Coulee\nThey own a section of land about 5\nmiles from Columbia siding, 80 acres\nof which is good fruit land.\nSEATTLE MEN\nINVEST HERE\nBusiness Men of Sound Cities Buy\nFruit Tracts in Wenatchee\nHeights.\nL. V. Wells is over from Seattle\nwith a number of Seattle and Tacoma\nbusiness men, whom he has interest\ned in this valley. The gentlemen are\nD. T. Lloyd, F. L. Devitt, J. F. Beede\nand Louis A. Rexford of Seattle and\nR. Newell of Tacoma.\nMr. Wells recently platted 500\nacres of land on Wenatchee Heights,\nthree and one half miles south of\nthis city. He owns an 800-acre tract\nthere to which he added 320 acres\npurchased from Clarence Wheeler.\nThe proposition which he presents\nfor the consideration of investors and\nhomemakers is very alluring. The\nland is to be sold in five and ten\nacre tracts at $500 an acre on long\ntime and easy payments. A contract\nis made with the purchaser whereby\nhe need not move onto or look after\nthe land for five years. The com\npany agrees to plant the trees and\ncare for the orchard until the five\nyears are ended. Which means that\nthe purchaser pays a reasonable price\nfor the land and on easy install\nments and it is turned over to him at\nthe end of the contract time with a\nbearing and income producing or\nchard. This is a proposition that\nappeals very strongly to anyone who\nis interested in fruit lands.\nThe gentlemen who accompanied\nMr. Wells are substantial busines*\nmen of Seattle and Tacoma and they\ncame over for the purpose of looking\nover Wenatchee Heights and were\nso taken with the proposition that\nthey each purchased a 10-acre tract\nand promised to interest a number of\ntheir friends.\nThe lans is under the Spring Hill\nIrrigation company\'s ditch and is on\na par with the balance of the rich\nfruit land of this valley. The pay\nments on a five-acre tract are ar\nranged to cover 80 months at $25 per\nmonth.\nOtis Kincaid and Miss Duffy drove\ndown from Waterville Saturday to\nmeet Miss Grace Walter at the train.\nMiss Walter, who has a position in\nthe Waterville Savings Bank, is Just\nreturning from a month\'s visit with\nher parents at Cheney. They return\ned to Waterville yesterday.\nMONDAY, MARCH 18, 1907.\nMEETING OF\nFRUIT GROWERS\nReport of Business for Last Season\nHeard and Plans for This Year\nStarted\nA called meeting of the Fruit\nGrowers\' association was held in the\nWenatchee theater Saturday after\nnoon, President A. J. Linville presid\ning. The meeting was called to\nhear the report of the past season\'s\nbusiness. The report showed that\nwhile there had been a few direct\nlosses on certain shipments of over\nripe fruit and a few cases of careless\ngrading, on the whole the association\nhad proved a big success. The as\nsociation shipped in the neighborhood\nof 200,000 crates of fruit during the\npast year and in comparison to the\nquantity of products handled the few\nsmall losses were insignificant and\nwithout consequence.\nThe members all expressed them\nselves as satisfied with the showing\nmade and are extremely enthusiastic\nover the prospects for the coming\nseason. They one and all predict a\ngreat future for the association,\ngrowers of this valley.\nPlans over the operations for the\npresent year were considered, and a\ncommittee of 2G appointed to decide\nupon and arrange a system of opera\ntions.

The\ncoming of Miss McDermott is said to\nbe the initiatory step toward the in\ntroduction of domesic science Into\nthe schools of the cify.\nTo every one who eats food, this\nmove must appeal as a most sensible\none. Too long have many of the\nschools fed us on the dry shucks of\nLatin and Greek while the question\nof how to make a living has been left\nin the background.\nToo often the college graduate\ncomes out of the halls of learning\nwith his diploma and his Latin and\nhis Greek but does not know how to\nmake a decent living. The question\nof home life and the question of\nbread and butter to the ninety nine\nout of a hundred, is the quention for\nus for the greater portion of our\nlives. "Bum biscuits or in other\nwords, poor cooking is said to be one\nof the most frequent causes for un\nhappiness in the married state.\nMiss McDermott should receive a\nhearty welcome by the ladies o* this\ncity.\nThe "hayseed" and "Rube" stories\nof the yellow press, put forth to\nshow what suckers farmers are, find\ncontradiction in the following amus\ning incident, which shows that at\nleast one tiller of the soil was fully\nequal to the occasion: An old Penn\nsylvania farmer, while on a visit to\nPhiladelphia, was taken with a vio\nlent toothache, and, calling on a den\ntist, was informed that the tooth\nmust be extracted, and that he had\nbetter take gas for the operation.\nThe patient agreed to his and then\nParted to count his money. The dci\ntist remarked, "Oh, you need not pay\nme until I have finished." "I reckon\n:jot," replied the farmer, "but if you\nare going to make me unconscious\n1 thought I\'d jest like to see how !\nstand."\nTne farm still overshadows tho\nmill, the factory and the workshop\nin providing exports. For the fiscil\nyear ended June 30, 1906, the sur\n,ilt.s exported amounted in value to\n$1)76,000,000, the largest ever reach\ned by agricultural exports for this or\nany other country, and exceeding the\nexport value of 1901, previously the\nrecord year. During the last seven\nteen years the exports of farmers\nhave exceeded the agricultural im\nports by $6,000,000,000, while all\nother producers find themselves at\nthe end of the same period with a\ntotal on the debtor side of $459,000,\n--000. Thus, it will be seen that the\nfarmer saves the "balance of trade"\nfor this country and is the prime fac\ntor of all the prosperity.\nGold Mining in Siberia.\nA curious and characteristic fea\nture of mining in the Orsk gold fields,\nSiberia, is the way the ground is\nprospected and opened up by the\npeasant "tributors."\nPermission is readily granted to\nsink shafts wherever they like, sub\nject to the conditions that they can\ngo down oe!v as \'ar as water level—\nusually about 60 feet—and that all\nthe Quarts ore extracted must be\ntreated at the mill on the ground of\nthe landlord and all gold extracted\nsold to him at a rate praviously de\ncided upon, leaving a fair profit for\nthe peasant and an extra good one\nfor the landlord.\nThere is no philanthropy about the j\ntransaction and the peasant is in no\nway bound to accept the terms. No\ncharge whatever is made for the use\n.of the mill. The fields is thus prac\ntically developedfor nothing—rich j\nreefs which would .probably remain\nundiscovered are opened up by the j\n"tributors," who frequently make\nfortunes out of rich strikes. The\nmine owner is thus continually in\ntouch with all that is going on and\nduly records the results of the opera-:\nI tions for his own benefit.\nSterilize All Criminals and Imbeciles\nAmong the many radical measures\nthat have been introduced in the\nvarious state legislatures this year,\nnone would be more far-reaching in\nthe direction of eliminating the crim\ninal element of our country, if car\nried into effect, than the proposition\nto sterilize every person convicted of\na statutory offense, of criminal de\ngenerates and the incurable insane.\nThe subject has long engaged the\ncareful attention of our leading\ncriminologists, and the proposition is\nregarded by them as being perfectly\nsound. They realize that the only\nsuccessful way to deal with the\nproblem of crime and other forms of\nimbecility is to make it physically\nimpossible for a person of that kind\nto perpetuate his strain.\nAgainst the two objections of "sen\ntiment" and "Personal Rights,"\nthere are urged many potent reasons\nfor the passage of a law of this kind.\nProbably the most Important is the\nrestraining effect such a law would\nhave upon those strongly inclined to\ncriminal trespass. If it were known\nthat conviction meant sterilization\nthere are comparatively few of the\narmy of those who are daily commit\nting crimes against nature, wh«\nwould care to take the chances of\nescape from the penalty. Among the\nother reasons urged is the one that\nthe operation removes the vicious in\nstinct and thereby changes the crim\ninal into a useful person. The move\nment is rapidly gaining supporters\nand it is probable that another two\nyears may find the sterilization pen\nalty upon the statute books of sever\nal states.—The Orator-Outburst.\nHome Mixture for Rheumatism.\nCut this out and put in some safe\nplace, for it is valuable and worth\nmore than anything else in the world\nif you should have an attack of rheu\nmatism or bladder trouble or any de\nrangement of the kidneys whatever.\nThe prescription is simple and can\nbe made up by anyone at home. The\ningredients can be had at every good\nprescription pharmacy and all that is\nnecessary is to shake them well in a\nbottle.\nHere it is: Fluid extract dandelion\none-half ounce; compound Kargon,\none ounce, compound syrup of sarsa\nparilla three ounces.\nTake a teasponfull after each meal\nand at bedtime. A few doses is said\nto relieve almost any case of bladder\ntrouble, frequent urination, pain and\nscalding, weakness and backache,\nMake Two Dollar? Grow Where One Grew Before\nThere is a saying which says\n"He who makes two blades of grow where only one grew be\nfore is a benefactor of mankind."\nSo it is equally true that "he who can make two dollars grow\nwhere one crew before 4s a benefaeae of himself\nHow will yen He it?\nUse your opera enemeata. Make money In the daytime and\nstudy at night.\nGo to the Might School of the\nThe Wenatchee Business College\npain above the kidneys, etc. It is now\nclaimed to be the method of curing\nchronic rheumatism, because of its.\ndirect and positive action upon the\nelimiuative tissues of the kidneys. It\ncleanses these sponge-like organs\nand gives tiiem life and power to\nsift and strain the posionous waste\naiaiter and uric acid from the blood,\nrelieving the worst forms of rheuma\ntism and kidney and bladder trouble.\nThe extract dandelion acts upon the\nstomach and liver and is used also\nextensively for relieving constipation\nand indigestion. Compound sarsap\narilla cleans and enriches the blood\nAs you or any one of your family\nespecially the old folks, may be at\ntacked at any time it would be wise\nto cut this out and save it.\nThe first fireproof American mail\ncar, practically all steel is at the na\ntional capital. It is 70 feet long, or\n10 feet longer than the maximum\nlength the government recognizes in\npaying for mail transportation. Only\n370 pounds of fireproofed wood are\nused in its construction. The letter\nand paper cases and boxes are of\nmetal. The life of the postal clerk\naboard the new car will be as safe as\nof a traveler aboard a Pullman car.\nCharacteristic Soaars.\n"It may or may not be the case that\na race\'s temperament can bo Judged\nfrom its folk songs," said a traveler on\na transatlantic liner the other day,\n"but it is Interesting to note tbe dif\nference of subject matter in the songs\nof various peoples.\n"Tbe Irishman, for instance, seems\nto sing for the most part about his\nladylove. Hardly any of his songs are\nnot addressed to his \'Somebody Ma-\nTourneen.\'\n"The Scot on tbe other hand, sings\nabout his country and its history, as a\nrule. \'Scots Wha Hae,\' \'Ye Banks and\nBraes o\' Bonnie Doon,\' \'Loch Lomond,\'\nand so on, might he taken as examples.\n"The Englishman, It is Interesting to\nnote, sings about himself all the time.\nHis songs are about his own glory, his\nships, his men, his power. He refers\noccasionally to old England, but only\nas a place he made famous by his own\nprowess. Unlike the Irish and the\nScotch, he sings little of his women\nand his country\'s beauties."—New York\nTimes.\nProof Positive.\nIt was a little male sparrow that\nhopped into the nest at about 4 a. m,\nHis wife was awake, awaiting him.\nThe little sparrow began his expla\nnation. He had been detained at the\noffice until late and was so tired be\nslept downtown. But he had got up\nearly and hurried home.\nThe lady sparrow looked him in the\neye.\n"You were up all last night with\nwicked companions," she cried, "and\nhave just got home. You haven\'t been\nto bed at all. You are a bad, late bird\nand not an early bird. Oh, why did I\ncv"—\nBut her mate Interrupted her with\nan imperious gesture. "Behold the\nproof!" he exclaimed, exhibiting a\nworm.\nAs it is an ascertained fact that late\nbirds never get worms, she was fain\nto accept the proof.—New Orleans\nTimes-Democrat.\nVWtherlr Discipline.\nShe came Into his study gently. "I\nnate to disturb you, dear." He looked\nup. "It is after 11, and Dick has\nnot come home yet—and—it is the sec\nond time this week he has stayed out.\nI did not wish to speak to you—but—a\nboy of seventeen"—\nShe faltered. He was looking at hei\nwith a strange, fixed expression. "1\nunderstand. Leave him to me. I shaii\nwait up until he comes in."\n"Don\'t be harsh with him," she said\npleadingly. "Oh, I am so sorry I told\nyou! Remember, he has always been\nsuch a good boy"—\n"My dear, you have nothing further\nto do with this. I must deal with my\nson iv my own way. I request you\nnot to interfere. You had better go\nquietly to your room. I ask you to do\nso. I want him to find me here when\nhe sees fit to return to his home."\nShe retired, with her mother heart\nanxiously beating, and waited until the\nclick of a latchkey sounded in th<?\nstreet door. She listened, trembling,\nready to rush out, a penitent peace\nmaker. She heard:\n"Dick, is that you?"\n"Yes, sir."\n"Is tbe dog in the hall?"\n"Yes, sir."\n"Well, turn out the gas. Good night!"\n—Madeline Bridges in Woman\'s Home\nCompanion.\n"This watch," said the apprentice,\n"runs too fast. I\'ll regulate nY\n"Do nothing of the kind," sadd tbe\njeweler.\n"Why not V the apprentice asked in\nsurprise,\n"Because," the other explained, "the\nowner teaches music."\n"Bnt hanged if I see"— began tbe\npuzzled apprentice.\n"Listen," the Jeweler mterrnpted.\n"When watches are left here, never\nregulate them unless there is a special\norder to do so. Some people—music\nteachers, for instance — want their\nwatches to run a little fast. So do\ncabbies. So do fencing masters. Other\npeople want their watches to run slow.\nBuilders like slow running watches,\nand so do ministers, and so do men\nwho play billiards by the hour."—Ex\nchange.\nThe Forehead.\nA receding brow, like a receding\nchin, shows a lack of will power and\nof a firm and quick intelligence. The\nforehead that has projecting "bumps"\nover the eyes Indicates observation. A\nhigh, prominent, bulging brow does\nnot contribute to the beauty of the\nface, hut it shows both the absent\nmindedness and the keen intellect of\nthe scholar. It is the forehead that\nlooks straight, but which in reality\nslopes back a very little, with the eye\nbrows projecting and firmly marked,\nthat Is one of the most desirable. Its\npossessor will be tolerant, but firm,\nsteady, intelligent and decisive.\nA Static Episode.\nWhen Mrs. Bellamy was acting Ali\ncia in "Jane Shore" the king was pres\nent among the audience. Apparently\nthe play was not so potent as the wine\nhis majesty had taken at dinner, for\nhe fell asleep, greatly to Mrs. Bel\nlamy\'s annoyance, for she drew near\nto his box and with a most violent ex\nertion of voice which tbe part admit\nted of cried out "Oh, thou false lord!"\nand woke tbe king, and thus, like Mac\nbeth, she murdered sleep and revenged\nherself on his majesty.—From "An\nnals of Covent Garden Theater."\nHorses\nFOR SALE\nAll* Weights \'\nEAGLE LIVERY &\nTRANSFER CO.\nCLASSIFIED ADVERTISEMENTS\nClassified ads Scents a line sen in\nsertion, minimum charge lO cents.\nGeneral lilacksmithing.\nRoss Bros.

The\nrailway commission made publlic for\nthe first time the fact that they had\nprepared new rules governing the\nsale of passenger tickets in this state;\nand these rules were read to the rep\nresentatives of the roads. The rail\nroads assented to that portion pro\nviding for the issuance of mileage\nbooks interchangeable on any road,\nbut asked for further time to consid\ner other rules presented by the com\nmission.\nThe adoption of universal mileage\nhas been demanded by the commer\ncial travelers for years. Under the\npresent system it is necessary for\nthem to purchase mileage on all\ntranscontinental roads or else the\nregular 3 cents a mile. The conces\nsion on the part of the railroads will\nbe considered an important one.\nAt the meeting yesterday all of\nthe members of the commission were\npresent, including Jesse Jones, the\nnew member. The railroads were\nrepresented by B. S. Grosscup, gener\nal counsel, and Vice-President Levy\nof the Northern Pacific; L. C. Gilman\ncouncel for the Great Northern; J.\nD. Farell, and General Passengsr\nAgent Adams of the O. R. & N.\nThe railway commission yesterday\nannounced the appointment of A. W.\nPerley of Colfax to be superintendent\nof tracks, a position created by the\nlast legislature. Mr. Perley is a lo\ncomotive engineer and is the oldest\nengineer in point of service in the\nstate, having been employd on the O.\nR. & N. for years. He is chairman of\nthe republican central committee of\nWhitman county.\nTieton Project Delayed.\nA dsipatch from North Yakima\nstates that from present indications\nthe Tieton canal project, which is to\nreclaim 25,000 acres of land in Yaki\nma valley, will be delayed one year\non account of the scarcity of labor\nand inadequate service of the rail\nroad in carrying supplies. The\nditch was supposed to have been com\npleted by 1908, but it is hardly pos\nsible now to finish it until late in the\nsummer of next year, which will\ncause the loss of next year\'s crop.\nWork on opening the portals of\nthe three long tunnels has progressed\nas far as possible until more machin\nery arrives and the power house is\ncompleted. Joseph Jacobs, the engi\nneer in charge, finds it impossible to\nsecure sufficient laborers, although\nthey are receiving $2.25 for a day of\neight hours. About 60 men are now\nat work on the portal of the long\ntunnel, about 10 miles from Naches\nCity, and he wishes to increase this\nnumber to 90 at once and has sent\nto Seattle for 30 men.\nIt is the intention to place 700 men\nat work as soon as drilling machin\nery arrives. The government is do\ning the work Itself as the bids for\nconstruction were rejected because\nthey were excessive. Mr. Jacobs as\nserts that he will probably ask a\nnumber of small contractors to take\ncontracts for small portions of the\nwork and handle a few stations. He\nbelieves the contractors with small\ncapital will be anxious to do the\nwork, and thus relieve the govern\nment of considerable worry. Com\nmodious bunkhouses and dining\nrooms have been built and the work\nmen have more comforts than usual\nin camp life. Preparations will soon\nbe completed for opening the tunnel\nand as soon as the machinery arrives\ndirt will fly and the real work will be\nbegun.\nTo Oar Friends—The Public.\n!
