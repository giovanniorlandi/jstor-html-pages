It describes the burnout and secondary traumatic stress literature which provides the evidence supporting their\nwork. Implications for practicing basic training in response to trauma and ongoing education are a key area for responding to\nfamily violence and preventing professional stress. A professional culture that supports and values caring well for those who have\nexperienced family violence as well as “caring for the carer” is needed. Working in teams and having more support systems in\nplace are likely to protect PCPs from secondary traumatic stress and burnout. Undergraduate and postgraduate training of PCPs to\ndevelop trauma knowledge and the skills to ask about and respond to family violence safely are essential. In addition, the healthcare\nsystem, workplace, and the individual practitioner support structures need to be in place to enable PCPs to provide safe and effective\nlong-term care and access to other appropriate services for those who have experienced family violence.\n1. Introduction\nBeing a primary care professional (PCP) means being at the\nforefront of managing chronic, complex, and difficult areas\nof health. Working with patients who have cancer, those who\nare dying and those who experience or have experienced\nfamily and/or sexual violence can be difficult and emotionally\nconfronting. In a day’s work, PCPs see many complicated and\ncomplex patients, but those who experience family violence\ncan be particularly demanding and challenging because of\nchronic health issues, psychological distress, relationship and\nauthority issues, and coping strategies such as denial or\nsomatization [1]. If we then add to the potential emotional\nimpact of survivor stories on PCPs, themental and emotional\nwork of caring for these patients, the patient-professional\ninteraction and boundary issues, and the long-term nature\nof the care required [1], we will have the perfect recipe for\nincreased PCP stress.\nWork-related stress is already experienced by family physicians\nand nurses, with burnout being the most investigated\narea [4–7]. Prevalence rates of burnout for medical residents\n(including family medicine residents) have been reported\nbetween 18 and 82% [7] and between 10 and 55% for family\nphysicians [4, 6, 7]. A number of factors have been identified\nas important contributors to burnout; these include the work\nenvironment, changing policy, changes in the practice of\nfamily medicine, workload, loss of autonomy, and feeling a\nlack of personal accomplishment [4, 7]. Personal characteristics\nof the PCPs themselves, such as being high achievers\nand perfectionists, the relationship between work and selfesteem,\ngender, age, and family and support networks, may\nalso contribute to their susceptibility to stress [4, 7, 8].\nPCP’s recognition and support of patients who have experienced\nviolence may improve themental and physical health\nthrough early intervention and better service access [9–12].\n', '2 International Journal of Family Medicine\nWorking with family violence can, in itself, be difficult\nand confronting for PCPs because of the patient’s experience\nwithin their family. PCPs may also be both victims and\nperpetrators of family violence and this can influence their\nability to work effectively with patients. A Canadian study of\nPCPs found that nearly 50% had experienced family violence\nthemselves [13]. An earlier study by Sugg and Inui reported\nthat 15% of male doctors and 31% of female doctors had a\npersonal history of child abuse or intimate partner violence\n[14]. PCPs may be concerned that family violence is a private\n“no-go” area that cannot be discussed without offending the\npatient. They describe feeling overwhelmed and concerned\nabout broaching the topic with patients, that they lack the\ntime and the confidence to deal with the problem, that they\nmight make the situation worse, and that they “cannot fix\nit” anyway [13, 15–17]. PCPs can find dealing with both the\nvictim and the perpetrator difficult [15].\nPersonal safety issues often confront those who work\nwith victimized children and adults. The traumatic nature of\nchild abuse and adult violence with its negative effects on the\nemotional, mental, and physical health of victim/survivors is\nwell documented. Less discussed is the impact of working in\nthis area on the well-being of the medical professionals and\ntheir staff [18].\nThis paper outlines a theoretical framework for understanding\nthe possible reactions of PCPs who work in this\narea.We then discuss the emotional and physical safety issues\nwhile being at work and the social, emotional, and physical\nimpacts of child abuse and violence at work. It concludes\nwith a discussion of strategies to reduce andmanage potential\ntrauma.\n2. Understanding the Potential for Trauma\nResearching and working with victims of family violence can\nbe emotionally challenging [19–23]. Working with children\ncan make it even more so because of bearing witness to the\nchild’s abuse experiences, conflicts with parents and carers,\nthe inability to form an effective therapeutic relationship with\nthe child or their family, a hostile working environment, lack\nof or failure of services to assist the child and the family, direct\nthreats and concerns about personal safety, and the possibility\nof litigation [22, 24–26]. In addition, working with victimised\nchildren and adults can evoke strong emotional reactions\n[22, 26].The general practitioners (GPs) below describe their\nencounters:\nA mother was breastfeeding when her son’s smile\ntriggered her memories of incest. She told me the\nstory of her pain caused long ago by the CSA\nperpetrated by her father. Her childhood abuse\nwas replayed across a generation. Her story was\npowerful, making me pay attention to her story\namongst so many illness stories. As I reflect on\nthat consultation now, I think it was the intensity\nof her fear and distress which alerted me to the\nimportance of her experiences. She put her baby\non one side of the consulting room, as far away as\npossible, and just cried. I did not know how to help\nher. (Female GP, urban) [27].\nThere were two boys and a little girl . . . and\nthey all lived in the same street. I went and saw\nthe parents of the two disabled boys [who were\nabusing the little girl] and they weren’t prepared\nto do anything, they did not want to know about\nit, did not feel like supervising, perhaps they did\nnot believe the story. I reported the case to child\nprotection and the families all said “We have to\nmove out of town if you cannot do anything and\nwe do not want to leave. The kids do not want\nto leave the school and why should we have to go\naway to keep our children safe.” [. . .] That process\nwas extremely painful, you need to go through\nwith the families, families of the abused and the\nfamily of the abuser and see it brought out in\nthe open, to the police and then watch them go\nthrough the pain, through the system. (Female GP\nsmall rural town) [28].\nBefore I started doing work [with men who perpetrate\nviolence], I can remember saying how lucky\nI was that I worked in an area where there was no\nabuse . . . what a clever decision I’d made, to pick\nsuch a good postcode, but obviously I just did not\nsee it [. . .] I think it’s more that you are aware that\nit [abuse] goes on and I’m looking out for it more.\nIn the past, if someone would say something, start\nhinting it, you’d run a million miles, you’d change\nthe topic, you’d start talking about something else\nand it’s easy to do that [. . .](Male GP, urban) [28].\nThere is an increasing literature on the emotional work\nof “caring”[29] and the toll this work takes on those who\nundertake it [18, 24, 30–32]. The effects of being a direct\nor indirect witness to child abuse and adult violence can\nresult in compassion fatigue, burnout, vicarious trauma\nand secondary traumatic stress. These terms are often used\ninterchangeably but are, in fact, conceptually different.\nCompassion fatigue is a general term applied to anyone\nwho suffers as a result of acting in a helping capacity, a natural\noutcome of helping and knowing about trauma [33, page 92]\nand [34, page 9].\nBurnout occurs when a person’s health or outlook on life\nis negatively affected because of the impact of their work.\nFigley [34] described burnout as physical, emotional, and\nmental exhaustion caused by long-term involvement in emotionally\ndemanding situations, as a gradual wearing down\nover time. Workers with burnout report low job satisfaction,\nfeelings of powerlessness, and being overwhelmed at work\n[34].\nVicarious trauma is defined as “the transformation of the\ntherapist’s or helper’s inner experience as a result of empathetic\nengagement with survivor clients and their trauma\nmaterial” [30, page 31] and results in a profound shift in\nthe worldview of the worker. The result of vicarious trauma\ncan potentially include the disruption of the worker’s view\nof themselves, “the self-changing nature of care giving” [31,\npage xxxviii], others and the world in general [35]. Child protection\nworkers, physicians, nurses, therapists, social workers\n', 'International Journal of Family Medicine 3\nand child abuse researchers report such experiences. The\ntraumatic experience can extend beyond those who work\ndirectly with the victim/survivor. Traumatization has been\nreported in those who have indirect contact: in receptionists,\nsupervisors, and managers, in those processing accounts or\nrecords, in family members of the treating professionals, and\nin those working with patient histories or reports.\nVicarious trauma influences different people in different\nways.The impact is related to the trauma they are exposed to,\ntheir own characteristics and history, the research methods\nthey use, their support systems, and context in which they\ndo their research [36]. It is described as a pervasive feature\nof working with the traumatised and a cumulative response\nto traumatic material. It can be triggered by either a one-off\nexposure to a significant issue or repeated exposure to a range\nof issues and incidents. It can have a profound impact on\nindividuals and be as debilitating as the primary trauma [30].\nOther contributing factors originally proposed by Pearlman\nand Saakvitne that apply to primary care across a range of\nsettings internationally include the chronicity of the trauma\nwork, combining service provision and research (particularly\nin resource poor nations), increased violence to women and\nchildren in war and conflict areas, the individual professional’s\ncapacity for empathy, and the individual’s personal\nhistory of trauma [30]. The vicarious trauma has been criticised\nbecause it fails to explain why similar experiences cause\nvicarious trauma in some while others do not experience\nvicarious trauma.\nSecondary traumatic stress is a similar concept to vicarious\ntrauma, but there are differences as it is based on a\nset of clinical symptoms. Secondary traumatic stress closely\nparallels posttraumatic stress disorder in its symptomatology\n[37] and is a normal response to exposure to trauma through\nworking with survivors of traumatic events [33]. Symptoms\nof secondary traumatic stress impact on psychological functioning,\nresult from cognitive shifts and disturbances in rela-\ntionships [2]. They include intrusive symptoms such as PCPs\nre-experiencing the survivors’ trauma through thoughts,\nfeelings, and images; avoidance and numbing symptoms such\nas avoiding working in areas that recall the trauma or forgetting\nparts of an interview; and symptoms of hyperarousal\nsuch as palpitations and sweating and nightmares and sleep\ndisturbances [38, 39].\nVicarious trauma and secondary stress have provided\nthe conceptual framework for much of the literature that\nunderpins the current understanding of the impact on those\nwho work with survivors of trauma. More recent work has\nhighlighted methodological issues and the need to measure\nall of these areas [39] to test their independence.\nIn medicine and nursing, the trauma literature is based\non burnout as a response to caring. Burnout is defined as\nfeelings of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a\nperceived lack of personal accomplishment because of a longterm\nengagement with emotionally demanding situations\n[2, 4]. Burnout as a model has the advantage of combining\nthe personal impacts and the impact on work, but the\ninterrelationships between the three factors are unclear [2].\nPreventing, understanding, and recognising vicarious\ntrauma, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout in their\nwork with family violence will assist PCPs to respond more\neffectively to it and to reduce its potential to adversely affect\nthe way in which they work and their view of the world in\ngeneral. For those already working in the area, it will assist\nthem to better understand their experience and for those in\nmanagement positions, to put in place strategies to prevent\nthe possibility of secondary traumatization for themselves\nand their staff.\n3. How Can PCPs Prepare to\nWork with Patients Who Have\nExperienced Family Violence?\nPCPs must be trained to do this work at undergraduate and\npostgraduate levels and as part of their ongoing professional\ndevelopment because PCPs still report being inadequately\ntrained to do so. Both training and professional experience\nhave been associated with increased feelings of confidence\nin dealing with violence as well as increased comfort in\ndiscussions with patients making PCPs feel more in control\nand reducing PCP stress [5, 13, 40].\nThe institutions and professional organisations responsible\nfor the education PCPs must ensure that students and\nprofessionals are trained well and develop the necessary\nknowledge skills and attitudes as well as the facilitating\nsupport for those working with family violence. Organisations\nwhich were expected to champion the health needs of\nwomen and children but failed to do so, by marginalising\nthe need to respond to violence, blaming the victim, not\naddressing the training needs of PCPs, and discrediting the\nwork of those responding to and supporting women were\nidentified as particularly difficult for workers and researchers\n[41]. Hierarchical organisations have been identified as a\nmore important predictor of trauma than the individual\ncharacteristics of the workers [42].\nThe education of PCPs should address the needs of\npatients first and foremost, but the PCPs sense of vulnerability,\nfear, and inadequacy also need to be addressed for them\nto work effectively in this area. Like other social problems\nand health risk behaviours, there is no easy “cure” to family\nviolence and PCPs need to reframe what they consider as a\n“successful” consultation [43] rather than being frustrated by\na lack of change [17]. PCPs report of positive changes after\nfamily violence is disclosed, including patient engagement\nwith counselling and legal services [16].\nI asked a 40 year old new patient about child\nabuse which I was certain she had experienced.\nShe denied ever experiencing abuse. I was left\nwondering what I could have done better. Twelve\nmonths later she came in and said “You know\nthat question you asked me twelve months ago, I\ncouldn’t talk then but I can today.” In retrospectmy\nfirst consultation was very successful, I just did not\nknow it. (Female GP, urban).\nTraumatic reactions are related to the duration of exposure\nto traumaticmaterial and the type of trauma experienced\n[5]. While PCPs cannot control the content on acute consultations,\nthey canmanage and structure their work in terms of\n', '4 International Journal of Family Medicine\n(1) Cognitive: mental activities that influence our perceptions, for example, self-talk/attitudes\n(2) Physical: physical and sensory activities, for example, music, exercise, driving, and going on vacation\n(3) Spiritually/philosophical: faith or value systems that provide an outlook on life or guidance/rules for living life\n(4) Social/recreational: all forms of creative expression or recreational diversion for example, spending time with friends,\nvolunteer work, and shopping\n(5) Verbal: using language to identify and express feelings/or stress, for example, talking, writing, and naming the problem or\nfeeling [3]\nBox 1: Five common self-care strategies identified in the literature.\nreview appointments and should consider structuring their\nwork so that they have regular breaks and opportunities to\nmanage less demanding problems. Support and supervision\nfrom more experienced or staff trained in responding to\ntrauma may help in the management of distressing cases.\nPCPs need to reflect on their ability to provide care for\nthose who have experienced family violence.While all should\nhave a basic competency in recognising and responding to\nviolence in positive and helpful ways, not all may be willing\nor able to deliver care. In such cases, knowledge of appropriate\nproviders of ongoing care and support services is essential.\nSupport systems and networks for PCPs need to be\nconsidered because these are often not routinely available\nto PCPs. Setting up a recognised “family violence team”\nat work for all who work with family violence is useful,\nproviding peer-peer support and the ability to discuss difficult\nor distressing cases [1]. Psychiatric and counselling services\nhave a much more developed culture of providing support\nand supervision for those working with mental illness and\ntraumatized clients. PCPs may need to consider engaging\nwith services outside of work for support and supervision\nif they are going to regularly work with family violence.\nNetworks can include coworkers within primary care and\nmay extend to other agencies working with those who\nexperience violence; working as part of a “team” is often a\nmuch more positive experience than working alone. Support\nsystems that extend beyond the clinic should not be forgotten,\nwith friends and family being reported as an important\nsupport [5, 41].\n4. Preventing Burnout and Vicarious Trauma\namong PCPs\n“A key factor in the ability to care for others is the\nability to care for oneself ” page 106 [44].\nWorking with family and sexual violence can be difficult.\nAlthough not all of us working with trauma will experience\nsecondary trauma, we are all at risk [45]. Acknowledging how\nemotionally difficult working in this field can be, recognising\nthat it will affect and may distress you, learning how to\nrecognise symptoms of secondary trauma early and the\nimportance of self-care are essential elements in managing\nand preventing secondary trauma.\nThe literature highlights a number of responses that can\nbe used at educational, organizational, and personal levels\nto prevent and respond to secondary trauma, and in turn,\nimprove the quality of care provided by PCPs to people\nexperiencing family and sexual violence.\nAt an educational level\n(i) An understanding of burnout, secondary, or vicarious\ntrauma and their implications should be integrated\ninto training curricula of all helping professionals\nworking with family and sexual violence [44, 46–48].\nAt an organisational level\n(i) Develop aworkplace policy that recognises secondary\ntrauma as a potential workplace health risk; addresses\nrelated stigma; normalises work place stress; and outlines\nappropriate responses, including professional\ndevelopment; workload and case management; peer\nsupport and ongoing routine management meetings\nin which secondary trauma is discussed [48–50].\n(ii) Develop a culture of learning, sharing and support\nwithin the workplace [44, 48].\n(iii) Provide adequate support and supervision which\nincludes discussion of secondary trauma and its\nimplications [46].\n(iv) Provide workplace development programmes that\ninclude secondary trauma and how to identify early\nwarning signs between oneself and others [46, 49].\n(v) Ensure managers who are appropriately trained to\nrecognise and respond to secondary trauma in a\nsupportive, nonpunitive manner [49].\n(vi) Review workplace policies regularly.\nAt an individual level\n(i) Develop an awareness of your own personal risk of\nburnout and secondary trauma and accept reactions\nas a normal response to specialised work [44, 51].\n(ii) Promote personal well-being by being physically\nactive, engaging socially, and volunteering in your\ncommunity and adopt appropriate self-care strategies\n[3, 48] (Box 1).\n(iii) Skill up in the field of trauma and family violence [47,\n52].\n(iv) Take responsibility for your own mental health and\nwell-being [49].\n', 'International Journal of Family Medicine 5\nTable 1: Indicators of secondary stress [2].\nPsychological Cognitive shifts/altered world view Relationship changes\nContinuing distressing emotions, for example, sadness,\nanger, fear, and shame Loss of trust and sense of safety Overidentification with patients\nIntrusive images of the patient’s experience, for\nexample, nightmares, or flashbacks Heightened sense of vulnerability Detachment from patients, particularly\nthose with traumatic experiences\nNumbing or avoidance, for example, Being unable to\nask about or work with family violence Helplessness Isolation from colleagues and peers\nSomatic disorders, for example, headaches and\nabdominal pain Loss of personal control Overprotection of or detachment from\nfamily and friends\nAddictive behaviours, for example, overworking,\nsubstance abuse, and compulsive eating.

Recognising Stress and Responding to It\nRecognising that we are under stress can be difficult, particularly\nwhen professional cultures discourage it. Many PCPs\nhave trained in systems that encourage them to be “in\ncontrol,” rational rather than emotional and to cover feelings\nof helplessness and powerlessness [1].This can be problematic\nwhen PCPs are stressed and hide it from their peers and\ncolleagues and, conversely, can be an area that colleagues fail\nto see occurring. It has been suggested that partners, families,\nand friends are better at recognising when we are stressed\nthan we are or our work colleagues are [1]. Table 1 the outlines\ncommon indicators of secondary stress.\n5.1. Management of PCP Stress. While prevention is the best\nmanagement, even with the best preparation some PCPs who\nwork with family violence will become stressed.Management\nstrategies can be drawn from both the trauma therapist and\nmedical burnout literature.\nLee et al. related stress to the healthcare system, the\noccupational system, and the personal system [40]. The\nauthors’ previousworkwith researchers and staffwhoworked\nwith sexual violence identified work-related management\nstrategies and personal strategies as their main support\nframework [41].\nIn terms of the health care system, policies and procedures\nthat recognise the time and expertise required for\nPCPs to support and provide long-term care for survivors are\nnecessary. Ensuring that adequate counselling and effective\ntherapy services are available to adults and children within\nthe community is essential to support the work of the\nPCPs. In addition, ongoing PCP education must develop and\nreinforce basic knowledge skills and attitudes to ensure that\nthey have the appropriate skills to recognise and support\nthose who experience family violence and to enable these\npatients to access the appropriate trauma services [4].\nWork-related management strategies in managing traumaticmaterial\ninclude ongoing development of skills because\nstudies suggest that becoming experienced and an expert\nreduced trauma [5]. Spreading the workload where possible\nis reported as helping [41].\nThose with better relationships with their coworkers and\nhigher numbers of support systems were less likely to develop\nsecondary traumatic stress [5].\nSelf-care strategies assisted PCPs; these included physical\nfitness, psychological strategies, spirituality/advocacy and\nstaying connected. Various forms of physical activity and\neating well have been described as well as using humour\nand laughter, avoiding retraumatizing material like films and\nnewspapers, being pleasedwith small changes, being creative,\ntravelling and exploring new places, gardening, talking with\npartners and family, eating and spending time with family\nand friends, going to church, praying, making a difference,\nand writing books, papers, and pamphlets to help [4, 52, 53].\nElwood and colleagues while recognising the importance\nof responding to workplace health risks and secondary\ntrauma suggest that we should proceed with some caution\n[54]. The development and implementation of workplace\npolicies on secondary and vicarious traumamust be informed\nby evidence andwith cognisance of available resources.Much\nof the research done to date is limited to high-income settings\n', '6 International Journal of Family Medicine\nand based on unclear definitions and weak methodologies.\nElwood et al. recommend more methodologically sound;\nanalytical research on secondary trauma, its symptoms, and\nresponses to ensure that we do not waste limited resources\non implementing ineffective interventions that are based on\na poorly defined construct. Interventions must be culturally\nappropriate and implementable in resource-constrained\nenvironments.\n6. Conclusion\nAddressing the educational needs of PCPs responding to\ntrauma is paramount. These need to be addressed at the\nundergraduate, prevocational, and practitioner levels on an\nongoing basis to develop a skilled and competent workforce\nwhere the potential for stress is minimised.\nAs PCPs engage more with recognising and responding\nto family violence, it will be necessary to put in place the\nappropriate education and healthcare system, workplace, and\npersonal support to enable the PCPs to continue to work\nwith patients who have experienced family violence and their\nongoing chronic health needs. PCPs need to be aware of\ntheir own support needs and the strategies they can put in\nplace to engage well with those who have experienced family\nviolence, providing safe long-term chronic care and access to\nthe required services.\nReferences\n[1] C.
