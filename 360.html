Judge Goodwin has always\nbeen a patriotic Nevadan, no matter where he might be living. Tie has\nabsorbed the soul of the sagebrush and one can never think of Nevada s\nhistory without thinking of him and his great-hearted comrades. In\nthose early times on Mount Davidson when men lived in Virginia City\nwho afterwards led in the creation of that great empire of civilization,\nthe Pacific coast of today, Judge Goodwin was a foremost figure. There\nwere giants in those days and he was one of them.\nIn California, he heard the golden-voiced Raker deliver the eulogy\nover the remains of David Bnxlerick. He knew Stephen J. Field anl\nDavid S. Terry and was at the birth of the feud between them which\nled over that long trail of blood and death. Tn Nevada, he was here\nwhen the commonwealth was admitted to the sisterhood of states and\nhe was one of those who, when the news of the Union victory at Gettys\nburg came across the continent, saw the stars and stripes on Mount\nDavidson\'s top illuminated by the setting sun as a message of hope for\nthe Union. Through all those stirring times he was a leader in that\nbrill\'mnt community a community of men such as never before had\nbeen gathered together on the face of the earth.\nlie has written inspiringly of those days and it is hoped that he\nwill speak of them at Carson City on the Fourth, telling us of those great\nhappenings of which he is among the few remaining men who can say:\n"All of which I saw and part of whic I was."\n, . CO\nNEWLANDS ON BRYAN\nwith the civilized powers by signing a treaty that assures peace in the\nfar east.

Boston Transcript.\nIn view of the Austrians\' assertions, made when they lostPrzemysl,\nthat the city was of little importance, anyway, the Tuetons seem to\nhave gone to undue trouble to get it back again. Philadelphia North\nAmerican. 1\nAmong the captains of the United States navy on the active list\njust published are: Augustus Fechteler, John Hoogewerff, Gustav Kaem\nmerling, Emil Theiss, George Kline, Joseph Strauss, E. W. Eberle, loyal\nAmericans, all Syracuse Post-btandard.\nIn an interesting interview in the Reno Gazette of Thursday, Sen\nator Newlands goes into more or less detail in discussing the present\nsituation with Germany and the European war in general. He also\noffers some valuable suggestions as to the means that may lead to Me\ntermination of the struggle. He endorses enthusiastically the stand\nPresident Wilson has taken and of William Jennings Bryan he has tnc\nfollowing to say:\n"Bryan is one of the most remarkable men in history. Tie stands\nwith Jefferson, Lincoln, Bright and Gladstone as the exponent of moral\nity in politics, of democracy in government, of the application of the\nprinciples of Christianity and the Golden Rule to international con\ntentions, and of altruism in human affairs. No man in public life in\nany age has impressed the public opinion of his generation more highly.\nHe must hold his standard high, but his place is conspicuously that of\nthe propagandist and not of the practical administrator. He would have\nlost much had he yielded to the expediency of the hour, and the world\nwould have lost more. We will hear great things from Mr. Bryan yet."\noo\nWHY NOT OUR SENIOR SENATOR?\nAs the time has arrived when suggestions are in order for naming\na successor to William Jennings Bryan in the department of state what\nis wrong with asking that Nevada\'s senior senator be added to the\npresident\'s cabinet? The Appeal\'s choice for the position would be\nFranklin K. Lane, under ordinary circumstances, but the fact that he\nwas Canadian born tells against him and he would not be acceptable\nfor that reason to millions of American people. Robert Lansing is out\nof the question because he is and has always been a member of the Re\npublican party, but in Mr. Newlands all these objections are nil. His\npartisanship, his patriotism cannot be questioned, and above all he\npossesses every requirement that makes for the successful holding of\nthe position.\noo\nCARRANZA\'S FOLLY\nCarranza is mainly responsible for the failure of the Mexican people\nto gather the fruits of a successful revolution to establish free govern\nment in that unhappy country, so it is to be expected that he will be\nthe chief obstacle in the way of President Wilson\'s demand for an end\nof anarchy. . .\nCarranza had the opportunity to be a Mexican Washington. In\nstead he has proved himself a stupid and obstinate old rhetorician who\nhas rnade Mexico\'s task the more difficult. The principles of Madero,\nwhich were the inspiration of the revolution, have been forgotten in trie\nanarchistic scramble for power, and for that Carranza is more to \'blame\nthan anybody else.\nIt is unfortunate that one who might have done so much tor his\ncountry has proved to be only a broken reed, but broken reeds cannot\nlong stop the march of events New York World.\noo\nTOPICS IN BRIEF\nIf the Vatican wishes to maintain its neutrality, it should reinstate\nthe Swiss Guards.
