The\ntnnk was 20 feet deep, and two work\nmen entered through the manhole\nfirst without taking precaution of hnv\ning ropes tied nbeut them.

They were net badly\nmangled, but net a bone in their\nframes was left unbroken, says the\ncounty physician, this fact being due\nte their being blown man\' feet into\nthe nir and the force with which they\nstruck the ground.

Hut\nthe excursion fleet returned disap\npointed. The great single stickers\nwent out Thursday morning fresh for\nthe battle, but the sen refused them\na field of conflict. The wind, never\nmere than nine nnd sometimes an\nlow os three knots, was tee light and\nshifty te carry the contestants ever\nthe 30-mile course in the time al\nlotted by the rules. At the end of\nfive nnd n half hours, the prescribed\ntime, the race was eillcinlly declared\noff, nnd the yachts were towed back\nte their berths inside Sandy Heek.\nWhen the gun en beard the commit\ntee beat was tired, te call attention\nte the signal declaring the race off.\nthe American yacht was still seven\nmiles from the finish line.

The yacht which\ncarried J. P.

While the test\nwas unsatisfactory, the yachting\nsharps, who have been skeptical up\nte this time as te the ability of the\nColumbia te successfully defend the\ncup, are mere confident that it will\nremain en this side of the Atlantic\nyet awhile longer.

In the mouth,\nfeed is masticated and mixed with saliva containing a digestant\ncalled ptyalln. In the stomach, it Is acted upon by gastric juice\ncontaining pepsin, which digests albumineus feeds. In the\nintestines, pancrcatin is added te digest fats and starches.\nIndigestion always Indicates an insufficient amount of oneor\nall of these dlgestan ts. At first thought it seems proper te abstain\nfrom feeds net easily digested; but rcilectien shows us that,\nwhlle this affords relief by giving the weakened organs less te\nde, it only makes them weaker by giving them less nourishment.\nIf you suffer from indigestion, the only right thing te de is te\ncat a generous variety of feed and digest it by using such a\npreparation as Kedel DtsrisrsiA Cube, which contains all the\nknewn.dlgestants, and completely digests what you cat.\nIt can\'t help but de you geed\nPrepared by E. 0.
