The merger, they, declared, will result in a closer cor, relation or supply and demand, bring, ing about better distributon and fet, ter ajustment of producton and mar, keting conditions., “The consolidation is a recogni, tion that readjustments in farm or, ganization and consumption bear a, vital relation to marketing prob, lems,” the department said today., “World.wide surveys and studies of, all the economic factors influencing, prices and movements of products, from producer to consumer will be, made. By handling tnese economic, questions in one bureau a composite, picture of the entire farm business, in its national and international as, pects is had. The consolidation also, affects certain economics in organiza, tion within the department.”, The three phases of the farmer\'s, economic problems—crop estimates,, farm management and marketing—, have been approached from the, standpoint of practical results which, would be immediately useful to far, mers and others, it was stated., “The present organization of the, bureau of agricultural economics,, which combines these three phases,, is seen as a logical and necessary, step as a government activity in, marketing system conforming to, present-day economics conditions,”, the department asserted., DEPEND UPON WOMAN, TO FIND THE WAY OUT, CRESTLINE, Ohio, July 14—When, Squire Frew Newman left on a trip, to Germany recently his daughter,, Mrs. Emma Newman Snyder, was, sworn in, and bonded, as his constable, in order to transact the business of, the squire’s office during his absence., A few days later Mrs. Snyder, the, only •woman constable in Crawford, County, was called upon to serve pa, pers on a local male resident., Going to his residence she found, he was absent. Pushing the papers, under the door, she was about to, leave when she remembered the pa, pers were not signed. She tried to, fish them back with her hatpin, but,, while the pin reached the papers, it, would not catch hold. She could not, draw them back out., She had an idea. Going to a near, by store Mrs. Snyder bought a pack, age of chewing gum. Returning to, the man’s house she chewed a bit of, gum, fastened it to the end of her, hatpin, thrust it under the door and, quickly drew out the papers, Signing them, she pushed the pa, pers back under the door., -- .. ♦---—, PITCHER’S SPEED CAUSES, BONES IN ARM TO SNAP, URBANA, O., July 14.—While throw, ing the last ball of a game between, two schools, in which he pitched no, liit ball, Fred Cressman put s" much, energy into the throw that his arm, snapped., Doctors discovered a week aft in, ward that a small bone in his right, forearm had broken.

At, torney General Daugherty, in the face, of a contrary ruling by his own de, partment, remains silent. Leaders of, the administration simply are watch, ing the situation, afraid to hazard a, guess how\' the muddle will work out., Ship subsidy legislation has been, thrown into a tangle because of the, ship edict., What is most feared now is that, zealous prohibitionists may go so far, in their race to put through additional, airtight liquor restrictions that the, rights of foreign governments will be, trampled upon and real danger invited, from that source., DRYS OPPOSE BOOZE SHIPS., Drys liaye long contended that even, foreign ships have no right to bring, liquors into American ports. Govern, ment foreign policy, however, has, steered the country clear thus far of, disputes on this score, and up to this, time foreign vessels, liquors have been, allowed to enter ports, but with their, liquid stocks sealed, after passing the, three-mile limit., The shipping board decision has led, to a tangle more grave than any pre, sented since the dry era began. The, hoard insists American ships owned, by the government will continue to, carry and sell whisky and other, liquors to passengers. This in spite of, the department of justice opinion hold, ing an opposite view., Attorney General Daugherty, un, able to reconcile the differences thus, engendered, refuses to predict the end, of the trouble, unless congress by, specific edict bars liquor from all, American ships or the supreme court, decides that it is unlawful for Amer, ican ships of any kind to make liquor, sales., A decision by the supreme court is, not possible for six months or more., It probably will be longer before the, highest court passes upon the ques, tion, even if agreement is reached to, expedite a test case when it is brought., The court never hurries in its decis, ions. None can speculate on how, long it will require to deliberate and, when its decisions may be expected., GOV. CAMERON MORRISON, Gov.

Those who at, tempt to palliate or explain the inhuman crime, are lacking in moral sense. The men slaught, ered were engaged in an employment that, was lawful, however unpopular in the immedi, ate localiy. There was even a question as to, whether , they were violating the laws of the, miners’ organization. At any rate most of the, working men tied together and shot or beaten, to death after capture were ignorant of any, intended offense., The anti-lynching law pending in Congress,, opposed by mob sympathizers and constitu, tional hair splitters, might, if in force, have, made the authorities of the county in which, these bestial crimes were committed, soiAewhat, more interested in the performance of the, duties they were sworn and paid to discharge., A heavy and richly justified monetary penalty, would have been imposed upon the locality, in which the law has been suspended by a, perverted public sentiment under which mur, der is no crime. The claim is often made that, attacks upon lynching are aimed at the South., Jn all the history of Southern lynehings, partly, to be explained by deep rooted racial preju, dice, there is no chapter of outlawry so black, as that which has just stained the reputation, of Illinois and of America as a land of law,, order, humanity and justice., We think sometimes that in this country we, are far removed from the possibility of such, organized brutality as that which reigns in, Russia. Incidents like that at Herrin, Ilk,, have a tendency to awaken us to the possibili, ties of a certain kind of education and agita, tion working upon the minds of ignorant and, brutal men. There are organizations and, politicians engaged from Washington and else, where in sowing the seeds of class hatred,, envy and lust for domination which, if they, come to their full fruition, will drench the soil, of this country with blood, and the Herrin, spectacle will become typical of conditions, throughout this country. This may seem an, alarmist statement, but anyone who will take, the trouble to look over the inflammatorv, literature being sent out by the train load, from Washington and other propaganda cen, ters will he convinced that it is not a far, fetched prediction., Lawlessness m a republic like ours, where, laws are lire handiwork of the people acting, through their duly chosen representatives, is, 1 reason; treason not only to statutory and con, stitutional law, hut to all that America stands, for. Those who engage in mob demonstra, tions, as Abraham Lincoln said, trample upon, institutions which are the hope of humanity, for liberty and progress. The man who apol, ogizes for or condones such lawlessness is, lacking in loyalty to the fundamental princi, ples of Americanism., As for public officials who have taken up, on themselves the solemn and sacred obliga, tion to protect life and property and liberty, under the law, hut who abdicate that function, in fear of the lawless or in order to court their, favor,-—what words are strong enough to char, acterize their weakness and shame? A cour, ageous law enforcement official true to the, oath of office he has taken, would bo willing, to die, and a cowardly one would resign, rath, er than betray his trust. If all those upon, whom the people of this country rely for the, maintenance of order and the enforcement of, law, were to abandon their obligations as com, \\, pletely as did those who abdicated their, offices in the Illinois locality which has just, been given world-wide odium, this republic, would be plunged into the black chaos of, wholesale murder and rapine. #, It is high time that there should he an, awakened sense of duty and responsibility, among citizens and officials throughout this, country. Lawlessness great and small is in, creasing. We cannot go much further along, the road of disregard of law and contempt of, courts arfd the preaching of class hatred and, envy by open or secret enemies of American, institutions, without paying\'a fearful price, for our disregard of things fundamental in, this republic. The Herrin massacre is an, alarm bell ringing in the night. Well it will, be if it should arouse the sleeping loyalty of, Americans to their priceless heritage of or, dered liberty., " NEW ASSAULT ON LIZZY’S FATHER, The assault by five members of the House, Military Affairs Committee on Henry Ford’s, proposal to buy from the government the great, Muscle Shoals plant serves a purpose only in, that it opens a new angle to the handling of, tin\'s gigantic government enterprise that will, arrest attention. The protestants charge that, the Ford plan is part of “the most insidious, propaganda that the nation has witnessed for, many a day.” They contend the plant has, cost the government $85,487,900, and that it is, proposed to sell it to Ford for less than $5,000,, 000. They contend the contract does not en, force the manufacture of fertilizer by Ford,, and that this fertilizer propaganda has been, spread to gain the backing of the farmer., Further, they sneer at the plea to labor in, stories of the possible employment for a mil, lion men. The chief cause of objection is,, however, that Mr. Ford “does not agree to, make fertilizers at all unless he can make, them at a protit to Inmselt.” inis is a ter, rible arraignment. By what rule of thumb do, these very patriotic congressmen condemn the, moral standard of a man because lie wants to, make a profit out of a business enterprise. Tf, avc had in the national congress a few men of, sufficient business acumen to think of profit, for the public, a\\to Avould not he worrying to, day about the disposition of the Muscle Shoals, plant. It would he operated by the govern, ment, supplying to the farmers fertilizer at, cost or near cost; it might even he turning, out standardized farming machinery and put, ting an end to the exploitation of the farmer, at the hands of the machinery trust. Farmers, mean food, and food means life. If the op, position can bring this about, then by all, means scrap the Ford plan, hut if it cannot,, if the country must await the sIoav disintegra, tion of the plan, if it must stand idle until it, rots and falls to pieces like so many of our, Avartime ships, if it must folloAV in the Avake, of the thousands of wartime automobiles, left, for months in the open, to he made junk by, the A\\reather, Avhile our patriots quibble like, the three little Tailors of Tooley Street, then, the sooner A\\re get some action and some \'sal, vage from the incompetency of our reclama, tion authorities the better., The shocked congressmen say Ford it not, an Alladin plus the lamp. True, but he is a, pretty sound business man, and his past per, formance for labor bespeaks Avell for the work, man in the future if he he permitted to turn, government floundering into private energy., | i, VOTE SWAPPING BECOMES A SCANDAL, The accepted practice of swapping votes in, state legislatures has reached a pass where it, is akin to national scandal. The public inter, est is sacrificed on the ealtar of county cupidi, ty, though .as a fact the home folks in the, long run pay dearly for their supposed fa\\ 01 -, ed legislation. “You vote for my bill and I’ll, vote for yours,” is the battle cry. “The pro, visions of -my bill will not affect youi tei i i, tory, and nobody cares anyhow.” The custom,, of course, is the outgrowth of the Washington, pork barrel scramble where favored noses are, so brazenly thrust into the national mono), trough. There it is bad enough, but when the, practice is brought more nearly home the ef, fect is demoralizing. Unprincipled legislators, are enabled to entrench themselves in office, so firmly that it soon becomes next to im, possible to uproot them. They always “make, good” for the home folks, and that is as fax, as the vision goes. The rest, to quote the, melancholy Dane, is silence. The practice, lowers the moral fibre of the people and legis, latures become simply distributing centres of, graft and special favors, state budgets are, swollen beyond all necessity, genuine expendi, tures do not count, nothing counts, indeed,, but moves that will keep the tawdry politician, in his legislative job., OFFICE CAT I, TRADE MARK, BY JUNIUS, COPYRIGHT 1921, BY COGAB ALLAN MOSS., Mathilde, Mathilde, your lover so old,, Is after a slice of John D.’s gold., Why not pick a Yank?

Figures, for Skagway and Haines and Sitka, are not available. One hundred and, thirty-three of the cars owned are, pleasure cars, 52 being trucks owned, by business houses and industries., Ketchikan has 41 pleasure cars and, 47 trucks; Seward 23 pleasure cars, and six trucks; Cordova four pleasure, cars and 12 trucks; the division not, being given in tfie other towns cov, ered by the list compiled., The towns from which the statistics, were gathered lie within the national, forest district and use the roads con, structed by the forest service. At, least a portion of the value of these, roads to the several communities, said, Mr. Flory, is represented in the large, increase of motor vehicles owned in, them during the last three years, or, since the forest service’s road con, struction program was launched., Three years ago, before the start ofj, the program these towns contained a, total of 51 pleasure cars, as follows:, Juneau 38, Ketchikan 9, Seward 5,, Cordova 1. In the intervening period, up to the time the figures were ob, tained, there had been added to those, numbers, Juneau 95, Ketchikan 32,, Seward 20, and Cordova 3, making the, total number of pleasure cars now, operated 201 in the four towns named, and a number of others in Hyder,, Petersburg and Wrangell, where no, segregation was made of passenger, machines and those used for other, purposes., It is estimated by automobile sales, agencies in the towns covered that by, the time the present road program of, the forest service is completed, within, two or three years, 227 additional cars, will be sold in them. These estimates, are based on the rate of sales made in, the past three years and do not take, into consideration the largely in, creased mileage of automobile roads, which will be accessible for motorists, at the time., The total value of the pleasure cars, now operated in the district mentioned, based on an estimated valuation of, $700 for each car, is $153,000. Local, automobile men regard this as very, conservative as a material proportion, of the machines represent a larger, investment than the average allowed., The per capita average of machines, compare well with figures for the Uni, tel States proper. Their population ac, cording to the 1820 census, was 9,050., Thus the 340 machines listed repre, sent a car for every 27 persons. In, Juneauy the percentage is much high, er, there being one car for every 17, residents., While no definite figures are avail, able as to the number of machines, privately owned in the territory, it is, believed that it is somewhere between, 750 and 1,000., Bright lights, snappy music and, springy floor; you’ll enjoy dancing in, h^gle Hall on Saturday night., HAYS MAY PROBE MOVIE TRIANGLE, Here is the first picture of Ro, dolph Valentino and his wife Na, tacha Rombova, in private life,, Winifred Hudnut, daughter of the, perfume manufacturer, while at his, right-may be seen Jean Acker, from, whom it is said the movie actor is, not divorced. j, SOVIET RUSSIA, THROUGH WITH, CONFERENCE, THE HAGUE, July 14.—At mid, night, the entire Russian delegation, to the adjourned economic conference, which reconvened here a month ago, issued a statement, that the meeting, was definitely ended as far as the So, viet government was concerned.

The delegates of, the other European countries have so, far refrained from making a public, statement over the failure of the con, ference. The utmost pessimism \'pre, vails among the economic experts, here over the future rehabilitation of, the industrial life of this continent., BELGIUM TOWN HAS, FAIR FOR FIANCEES, BRUSSELS, July 14—Escaussines,, Belgian village famous for its pretty, girls, is the only town in the world, that has an annual “fiancee fair.”, The “fair,” a literal “marriage mar, ket,” was hel dthis year for the first, time since the war. In spite of the, dearth of men, still a marked result, of long casualty lists, hardly an elig, ible fiancee in Bcaussines now re, mains unengaged., The village is decorated for the fair, —just as it would be for a lace fair,, or a catlte fair, or any kind of a ker, messe. The girls themselves put on, their best dresses and wash most, cleanly—but undue rouging is prohib, ited., Dancing is the order of the day and, the stealing of kisses does not con, stitute a misdemeanor. A speech, en, couraging marriage and decrying, celibacy, is made by the mistress of, the fair. Provision is made for, “courting" by the preparation of, nooks and arbors near the fair, grounds, where couples may stroll not, too publicly., Signs about the fair grounds sug, gest to the youth of Ecaussines:, “Love, then marry.” “Search, and you, will find.” “Let us marry.”, Pinchots are Pals in Their Victory, t As soon as thue. returns proved that Gifford Pinchot had smashed, fc.p\'°i1|!<131 machine of Pennsylvania, the most conservative strong, ReP“bJicafl party, the smile of victory illuminated the faces, of the victor and his wife.

Covering a territory, larger than the United States in area,, this group is distributed among twen, ty-four districts, each district, except, ing four railroad centers, being in, charge of a supervisor, who is respon, sible to the chief of the Russian unit,, at Moscow., The headquarters at Moscow is ro, ganized much the same as the general, headquarters of an army, there being, ten divisions, including executive, ad, ministrative, supply, traffic, liaison^, communications, medical, finance,, motor transport and special investiga, tion. Only forty-seven Americans are, employed in these departments, which, direct the entire operation cf relief., SHIP FOOD TO VOLGA., The main effort is directed toward, point in the Volga valley and dis, tricts adjacent to it. From Kazan,, the seat of government of the Tar, tar republic, south of Astrakhan, at, the mouth of the river on the Cas, pian Sea, every railhead on the Volga, is manned by an American unit, sixty, men being required for the task of, feeding more than 5,000,000 people., Beyond the Volga are the two Asiatic, border districts of Orenburg and Ufa,, a thousand miles removed from the, base at Moscow., In the Ukraine and the Crimea, refugees feeding, child feeding and, food remittance deliveries are carried, on by twenty-seven Americans operat, ing from the five strategic points of, Kiev, Kharkov, capital of the Ukraine;, Ddessa, Ekaterinoslav and Theodosia., West of Moscow to the Polish bor, der refugee kitchens and food remit, tance bases have been established at, Vitebsk, Minsk and Gomel.

Corn, is shipped directly through these, points for transshipment, to famine, centers. From the two Upper Volga, points of Ribinsk and Nizni-Novgcrod, it is placed on barges and river steam, ers for shipment to districts farther, south., COVER LARGE AREA., Thus every thickly populated cen, ter of Russia is covered. The cities, of Moscow and Petrograd have in, dependent district supervisors who, direct child-feeding and food remit, tance operations, the child-feeding, alone amounting to about 35,000 in, each city. Petrograd is now opened, to navigation, and an American has, been placed in charge of port opera, tions there., It is not difficult to believe that, the feeding of so many people over, an area of nearly 4,000,000 square, miles is a task fraught with com, plexities. Telegrams take from two, to three days in transmission, some, times much longer. Frequently they, never reach their destinations. Due, to the difference in alphabetical char, acters between Russian and English, telegraphic communication between, Moscow and the districts has to un, dergo the laborious process of trans, lation, transmission and translation, back into English again., TRAVEL IS SLOW., Preparing for an inspection trip, down through the Ukraine is like, preparing for an expedition into, Northern Canada. Although a round, trip from Moscow to Kiev, Odessa,, Theodosia and returnl is only a mat, ter of 2,000 miles the trip takes from, three to four weeks., Despite rail and telegraphic handi, caps! however, the supply division, of the American relief administration, has moved nearly 200,000 tons of corn, from seaport to districts while putting, into district warehouses a three, months’ protection ration of child, feeding supplies for the Volga. Dur, ing the last week these supplies have, been moving out of the Moscow! ware, houses at the rate of 3,000 tons daily., The food remittance division is filling, orders for adult food packages as fast, as they come in from London and New, York. Two hundred thousand food, packages have been distributed in, Russia to date, and 2,500 a d^y are, being shipped to the districts.

In the downtown district, new buildings are springing up on, every corner with amazing rapidity., Pittsburgh, already a city of sky, scrapers, by Chrstmas time will have, several more tall buildings. Scores, of business structures are going up., Great apartment buildings are either, under way or about to start., ,v Thoughout Greater Pittsburgh there, are a vast number of private resi, dences being built. The total ex, penditures for buildings—business, and residential—probably will reach, $25,000,000 by the end of the year., Millions more are being spent in and, about Pittsburgh by the city and Al, legheny county for street, boulevard, and road improvements., For a year or more Pittsburgh was, .tied up by the building trades. They, fixed the scale and said they would, not cut prices. Building contractors, and home builders said they would, not pay pre-war wages, and as a, result there was very little building., Atop cf all this, prices for materials, were maintained at war-time levels., But this spring one of the unions, decided it could materially reduce, its scale in crder to get its men, back to work. A month rolled by, and another union reduced its scale,, One by one the other unions lowered, their scales., MATERIAL PRICES LOWER., Material dealers were piled high, with costly stocks and not turning a, wheel. Interest, overhead and tax, charges were eating them alive. So, they, too, decided to reform. With, one slash they trimmed their quota, tions about 25 per cent., Then things began to start in the, building line with a big rush. Thou, sands of men who had been idle for, months went back to work, greatly, relieving the burden of charitable, organizations., The contractors now are skirmish, ing around to get men. Everybody, in the building trade crafts seems to, be working steadily., The Mellon National Bank is erect, ing a monster new banking building, >, —the sure, economical way, If your power need*, do not include trac, tive work, you can, obtain the “Cater, pillar” Motor in 30,, 45,55 or 75 horse, power for a station, ary or portable unit., If you have a’problem of moving equipment or trans, porting freight, supplies or ore, the Caterpillar, Tractor can serve you, as it has served and is serving, thousands of others—including many Alaskan users., The work of the “Caterpillar” Tractors on the, Seward-Fairbanks Railway and on other tractive, work of all kinds in every part of the world has, proved their ability to work successfully under seem, ingly impossible conditions.
