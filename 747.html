In turn the\nrailroad whicch was recently levied\nupon by Sheriff Thomas of Marion\ncounty, under a court order would be\npermitted to operate without restric\ntion.

They,\nthemselves, had planned an offensive\nthat fffternoon. So the Turks found\ntheir adversaries more than prepar\ned. Long lines of Kemansi iroupa\ncould be seen crawling down from\nthe" summits of the mountains in ser\nnpntinp fashion. The Greeks hurri\ned to their positions and awaited the\norder to fire.

Russell, of\nCrescent City was the honor guest at\nyesterday\'s luncheon of the Kiwanis\nclub when about thirty-five members\nwere present. Senator .Russell had\nbeen asked to make a few remarks\nand chose for his subject the Palatka\nCrescent City road, appealing to\nthe Kiwanians to lend their aid in\nputting this road in passable shape.\nMr. Russell spoke in his usually\nhappy vein. After his preliminary\nremarks he said:\n"As you all know, my home town\nis Crescent City, and if you will par\ndon me, I want to tell you some\nthings about that "home town,"\nwhere\n\'\'I live in a house by the side of the\nroad,\nWhere the sons of men go by;\nTh meen who are good, the men who\nare bad,\nAs good and as bad as I."\nCrescent City constitutes the most\npopulous election precinct in Putnam\ncounty, and it covers less territory\nthan any precinct in the county out\nside of Palatka. It has a summer\npopulation, according to the census\nof 1920, of 1,366. Its winter popu\nlation is easily double that number.\nThe Crescent City section is at pre\nsent the second largest citrus fruit\nproducing section in all Florida. No\nother station, save Arcadia alone,\nships as many boxes of fruit as Cres\ncent City. Its crop for the present\nyear will exceed 350,000 boxes. There\nare six large packing plants at Cres\ncent City. From November to May\ntheir weekly pay roll is enormous.\nMuch of this money would find a nat\nural outflow Palatkaward, were it\nnot for the handicap of a miserable\nroad.\n"It is of this road I desire to speak\n.and for which I desire to invoke your\n;aid. When the two short links of\nToad in southern Putnam and northern\nVolusia are completed, there will be\n\'a hard-surfaced highway from Jack\nsonville to. Tampa, through Palatka,\nCrescent City, Seville, DeLand, San\nford, Orlando, Kissimmee, Lakeland,\nPlant City. Two links doesn\'t mean\nimuch in sausage, but they are im\nportant when it comes to a through\nhighway. The Putnam county link\nwas organized on the "special tax\ndistrict" plan, and bonds in amount\njof $160,000 were voted. The money\nifrom sale of these bonds has been\n)ying in bank now for over two\n5-ears, drawing interest at the rate\npf 6 per cent per annum. We want\nihis money to go to work like a re\nspectable entity, and not loaf its life\naivay in idle, bank-made luxury at\nthe expense of the tax payer.\n"Over the major part of this pro\nposed road we once had a very fair\nSand-clay highway; today that sand\nclay highway is heaped high with a\n.sand-graded road bed 50 feet wide\nand three feet deep, through which\nmeanders a snak-like track that ir,\ndry weather practically shuts Cres\ncent City out from the world. We\ncan neither get in nor out. This,\ngentlmen of Kiwanis, is an outrage\non an unoffending people. We want\nto reach Palatka for important mar\nketing, but we cannot. We are in the\ngrip of the State Road Department\nand the Federal Aid Commission,\nwho seem to have gone to sleep on\ntheir jobs.\n"The State Road Department has\nprosniised that just as soon as the\nFederal Department approves the i\nmaterial, the State will hard surface i\nBut when will that be?

I am\nsure that every citizen of Palat\nka feels that they are living in\nthe best town in Florida, and we\nare. But did it ever occur to you\nthat you can help make. our city\na better and cleaner city. We\nare all part and parcel of the\ncity we love, and it is our prem\nises that show to the stranger\nwithin our gates the kind of city\nwe have and the people that\nlive in it. If weeds are growing\nabove the fence in the side yard\nor if your parkway is not well\nkept it casts a reflection not on\nly on you but on the town you\ndoing things; acknowledge us as a\nlittle brother.\n"Crescent City is some \'punk,\' At\nleast its people have that feeling.\nAnd it won\'t hurt Palatka to en\ncourage it. On the other hand it\nwill work to Palatka\'s advantage.\n"Let me tell you, that within the\npast month people in Crescent City\nhave subscribed to 25,000 in the\nstock of a new bank. They have\nalso subscribed $25,000 in the stock\nof a new hotel company. Now my\nfriends, be with us; give us your\nmoral support; let me go home and\ntell the people of Crescent City\nHow the powerful Kiwanis,\nRubbed his loving nose against us,\nLike a bull pup in the darkness;\nTold us how he would protect us;\n\'Gainst designs of men of harm us\nSaid true city Might was gen\'rous;\nThat, in fact, it set the paces,\nFor the struggling, lesser places,\nThat contribute to the making\nOf a prosperous State or Nation.\nlive in; There is dity ordi\nnance relative to the cutting of\nweeds but your Chief of Police\ndoes not feel that he should have\nto remind you every time your\nplace needs cleaning up. Way\ndown deep we all have civic\npride but we too often neglect\nthe things that should be done.\nNumbers of complaints have\ncome in within the last - two\nweeks about weeds on various\nlots and parkways, and were\n.these all referred to the Chief of\nPolice it would require about\nhalf of his time innotifying\nproperty owners\' that their weeds\nneede cutting.\nSo these matters I am sure\nwill adjust themselves once we\nall get to thinking how much\nbetter it would look if our town\nwere free of mosquito breeding\nweed patches and our lawns and\nparkways kept mown, therefore\nI am making this appeal to every\ncitizen of our city to cut your\nweeds( clean up your premises,\ntake your garbage can off the\nparkways after the- trash man\npasses.\nYour civic clubs are doing\nwonderful work in bringing\nabout a cleaner city and they\nneed your help the city needs\nyour help. It is only a short\ntime before the winter visitors\nwill be coming to Florida and we\nwant our city to look the best of\nall the others. But lets not wait\nfor the visitors to come. Lets\nclean up now and enjoy it our\nselves. Ask the chairman of your ward\ncivic committee to call a meeting\nof your ward right away and\nstart the movement.
