JK Jo\nV\nTALK WASA MASTERPIECE\nDistingimhrd Divine IbhU CUc\nAttention of Atidircicc for\nMore Than Hour.\nThe comnx tier merit Krtnii\ndelivered by Bishop Theodore D.\nBr&tton before the graduation\nclass of the Industrial Institute\nand College Sunday morning was\na master-piece, convincing ana\npowerful and went home to\neveryone in the large audience.\nThe graduating class of\ngirls marched in to lha strains of\nmusic, played hy Miss Louise\nAntley.\n\' Rev. VV. S. Slack, pastor of St.\nPaul\'s Episcopal church, former\nly opened the exercises hy scrip\nture reading and prayer. Rev.\nW. L. Duren. of the First M. E\nchurch, invoked God\'s Messing.\nMiss Mattie Lou Brown sang a\nsolo in excellent voice and was\naccompanied on the piano hy\nMiss Evelyn Windham.\nPresident Henry L. Whitfield,\nin complimentary words, intro\nduced the distinguished divine,\nwho held the rapt attention of\nhis audience for more than an\nhour. He took for his text the\nfirst verse of St. Paul\'s epistle to\nthe Corinthians; "Now concern\ning spiritual gifts, My brethern,\nI would not have you ignorant."\nHe interpretated these epistles as\n, wonderful documents in the form\nof personal letters which deal\n"vvitlf the relation of "heart and\nmind. All gifts having their or\nigin in the Supreme being.and he\npurged this class to render true\n\' service to the giver of all gifts.\n. Bishop Bratton said that in\ntellectual attainment did not\nmean spiritual gifts. "Mind is\nnot synonymous with spirit.\nWho ever confounds the two\nmakes a fatal error. There is no\nsubject of greater importance\nthan that concerning spiritual\ngifts. All gifts come from a\ncommon origin. There are diver\nsities of ability. Gifts differ in\nimportance, \'striking gifts like\nspeaking with tongues.\' No gifts,\nhowever groat, should be the\nobject of envy." He admonished\nthem to use tluur gifts for God\'s\nglory. Devote their talents t -the\nuse of edifying. "There is\na-out to be danger of deny Wie\nthe very presence of God\'s holy\nppirit. Our fceneration has ex\nplored the material world as has\nnever been before. We talk\nhourly from one side of the\nworld to another. This world has\nmade wonderful speed. Our cit\nies are displaying a luxury Rome\nnever dreamed of in its day. Tre\nmendous advancement has been\nmade in trade. We have accus\ntomed ourselves to the thought\nthat this world is our abiding\nplace. All these things have not\nchanged the fundamental princi\nples of life. We are just pre\ncisely where and precisely what\nour fjre-parents were in the gar\nden of Eden. All formality and\nphysical gratification has a just\nclaim, but man is not affected by\nhis robe or his money. Man must\nrealize himself to be a spirit made\nfor God."\nAnti-Frat Act Upheld.\nWashington. June 1 The\nconstilutiona ity of the Mis-\nt-issippi anti-fraternity law\nwas upheld by the supreme\ncourt today in a unanimous\ndecision.

It does not promote that\n"clear and full understanding"\nas to a grave situation which\nPresident Wilson in his note de\nclared to be desirable. The man\nnt r in which Berlin receives our\nrepresentations in regard to the\n.\'inking of the Lusitanla cannot\nfail to create a most disagreeable\nImpression in this country, which\nthe note\'s outward form of\ncourtesy will not remove.\nWashington Post- Geimar.\'s\nfailure to measure the depth of\nAmerican feeling over the Lusi\ntania case will cause profound\ndisappointment and uneasiness\nin the United States. The Amer\nican people shrink with horror\nfrom the thought of going to\nwar with Germany, but it need\nnot be denied that the failure of\nGermany\'s military government\nto guarantee the safety of Amer\nican lives at sea arouses keen ap\nprehension of future happenincs.\nThis is a time for moderate\nspeech and careful action.\nPittsburg Di; patch The points\nraised may te..n trifling com\npared to the nnin issue set forth\nin the president\'a note, but can\nwe as consistent advocates of the\narbitration of international ques\ntions deny the further considera\ntion which Germany ask??\nBaltimore Sun Germany\'s n\nply, so far as the main issues are\nconcerned, is no answer at all.\nIndianapolis Star Level-headed\nAmericans will await the\nprogress of events with calmness.\nIf Germany has any facts or in\nformation to justify its assumpt\nion that the Lusitania was armed\nor carried explosives it should be\npermitted to offer them.\nSt Louis Repuhlic This docu\nment\'s chief significance is not\nin the things put in, but in the\nthings leff out. The German\nnote ignores the whole iabric of\ninternational law and the rights\nof Americans on the high sea.\nThe people of the United States\nstand behind the president.\nTransfer Name of College.\nWest Point, Miss., May 29.\nj Southern Cnrisiian College has\nbeen transferred from a stock\ncompany made up of the Brother\nhood of Mississippi t j the Broth\nerhood of Alabama, Louisiana\nand Mississippi.

Those seeking admission\nare required to sign the following pledge:\n"I believe that nothing i3 right. I believe that\neverything is wrong. I believe that I alone have\nthe right idea. The town is wrong, the editor is\nwrong, the teachers are wrong, the people are\nwrong, the things they are doing are wrong and\nthey are doing them in the wrong way anyhow. I\nbelieve 1 could fix things if they would let me. If\nthey don\'t I will get a lot of fellows like myself and\nwe will have a law passed to make others do things\nthe way we want them done. I do not believe that\nthe towu ought to grow. It is too big now. I be.\nlieve in lighting every public improvement and in\nspoiling every body\'s pleasure.

This may be due to the lack of inf rma ion\nin refer nee to the relative feeding va\'uc of the sev\neral h-iys. Johnson grass bermuda and Icsped z.i\nhays hav never been included in the grad. s e -tablished\nby the National Hay Association, and y t.\nthe principal Iny markets of the South liny and sell\nhay under the rules of this association. This is un\nfair and should be corrected. Johnson grass, her\nmuda and lespedeza hays should be included in the\ngrades established by the National Hay Association.\nIt has, apparently, been arcepted as a fact, with\nout question or invest igaiion, by a large per cent of\nthe people of the country that timothy is tiie best of\nthe grass hays. Chemical analysis is not always a\nsafe guidj in the purchase of feeds. The analysis\nshow only the nmount of nutrients presi nt but fails\nto show the digestibility or palatabilitv, two very im\nportant factors in economic feeding. For the pur\npose of obtaining definite data as to the relative\nfeeding value of several common hays, the experi\nment station during the past winter conducted a\nfeeding expeiiment with mules, using Johnson grass,\ntimothy, bermuda, lospedtza and alfalfa hays.\nThe experiment began February 10th and con\ntinued for 8!) days. For this experiment two and i\nyear old mules were used. The different lots wen;\nfed under shelter and allowed the freedom of a lo\nin which there was fresh water at all times. The\nhays used were all home grown except the timothy\nThe timothy hay was choice and free from other\ngrasses. The Johnson grass was choice and free\nfrom other grasses. The bermuda was bright am\nwell cured but contained about 10 per cent of foreitrn\ngrasses. The lespedeza was well cured and blind\nbut contained from 10 to 15 per cent of foreign\ngrasses. The alfalfa was choice and free from for\neign matter.\nI i be tax collector ha not pre\nviMsly had any experience with\nm .eh office, it will be necessary\nt him to learn the duties of the\nl!i . after taking charge of it,\np i-ibly at the expense of the\ntaxpayer?. ou have had the\nexperience, and are therefore\nwell qualified.
