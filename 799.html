The President himself prob\nably will take personal charge of the\nadministration\'s national defense I\nplans in Congress.\nAssistant Secretary Breckeuridgo\nalso resigned as a mark of loyalty to\nhis chief whose views he shared. The\nPresident accepted his resignation.\nBoth take effect immediately. Major\nGeneral Hugh L.

Although Mr. Garrison first sug\ngested that he leave the Cabinet last ,\nmonth, Mr. Wilson did not formally\naccept his resignation until late I\nThursday afternoon, when informer!\nthat Mr. Garrison had left for New |\nYork and that a rumor of his resigna\ntion were current. The President then\ndictated the letter of acceptance and\ndispatched it immediately.\nIt was not until 8 o’clock Thursdaj\nnight that formal announcement of tin\nGarrison and Breckenridge reslgna\ntions was at the White House.\n• It is known that one of Secretarj\nGarrison’s principal reasons for hit\nconviction that oniy a federal contl\nnental army, ( nstead of & reorganized\nnational guard, could be the main mil\nltary dependence of the nation, wai\nhis belief that some day the United\nStates may be called upon iO defend |\nthe Monroe doctrine, and in thai\nevent he foresaw the national guard\nmight not be available for use outside\nof the United States before a declara\ntlon of war.\nUpon the contention on the one\nhand that the continental army or ulti\nmately universal service was the na\ntion\'s only reliance, the position, or\nthe other, that no one plan could b«\nenforced upon Congress, Preslden\nWilson and his secretary of war part\ned official company.\nMr. Garrison\'s resignation was *\ncomplete surprise to official Washing\nton generally. He made no pcsona\nexplanation.\nSeveral hours before the official an I\nnouncement ho had boarded a trail\nwith his wife for New York, and word\nhad been passed at the departmeni\nthat he had gone for an indeflniti\nstay.\nThe acute differences of opiniot\nwhich led to the break began early it\nthe year when opposition to the con |\ntinental army plan began developinj\nin Congress.\nThe circumstances which led up tc\nthe resignation are detailed in the sec\nretary’s correspondence with the Pres\nident, which was made public tonight\nby the White House.\nTEUTONS TO SINK ARMED SHIPS\nNotice Given That Merchantmen Car\nrying Guns Will Be Treated as\nWarships.\nGermany and Austria-Hungary hav«\nnotified the United States and othei\nneutral nations that beginning Marct\n1 they will regard all merchant vos\nsets carrying guns iu tne same ciass\nas warships and that they will be at\ntacked in the same way, without anj\nobligation to give warning to crew oi\npassengers. The United States, on\nthe strength of this statement coon\nwill issue a warning to American citi\nzens that they will not be protected\nby their government if they take pas\nsage on such armed vessels, which, in\nthe eyes of the United States govern\nment, would be equivalent to taking\npasse.ge on an armed cruiser of one ol\nthe belligerents.\nThe action of the Teutonic powers\nis believed to have grown out oi the\nrecent general note by Secretary ol\nState Lansing to all the belligerents, |\nproposing a new set of rules to govern\nwarfare on tho sea.\nDefense Measures to Be Passed.\n( Washington.
