Now he\nis striving to battle down what the\nages past have deemed an impene\ntrable barrier between the fair maid\nof the east and the noble young hero\nof the west.\nI see him, with glowing counten\nance, as he struggles to the summit,\ntips his hat to the back of his head,\nshades his eyes with his large brawny\nhand and for the first time looks\ndown upon the western sloop of the\ngreat Rocky mountains. His keen\neye penetrates far to the north, far to\nthe south and still on to the west,\nover one grand panorama, bathed in\nthe golden glow of a western sunset\nthat seems so fittingly to represent\nthe golden treasures and hopes wrapt\nwithin its bounds for those hearts\nbrave enough to penetrate its hidden\nfastnesses.\nHere and there, like stately sentin\nels, stand in radiant purity, vast snow\ncapped peaks, fit guardians of the\nhidden store house about them, their\nsides, below the snow line, one\nmagnificent green of the pine, fir,\nhemlock, spruce and cedar. Here\nand there great deep mountain\ngorges, through which plunge in un\nceasing roar the mighty floods in\ntheir onward rush to the great\nPacific.\nFarthur down, the mountain sides\nspread into great undulating prairies,\nthrough which the roaring torrents of\nthe mountains, glide in silence, paint\ning a beautiful silvery thread as they\ngo. The scene thrills his very soul,\ncompletely captivating him. His\nhand uncovers his head, his knees\nbend in reverence, and here in the\nsunset glow he bows in holy awe, as\nif face to face with the creator of all\nthis magnificence. Softly and silently\nthe picture fades as the sun sinks be\nneath the western horizon. Again 1\nsee him seated in the silent gloom of\nhis evening camp fire, that throws\nits brightening rays upon the sur\nrounding folliage, like the lingering\nlight that has so brilliantly gilded the\nwestern sky. His brain still reels in\nglowing intoxication of that scene,\nand other visions of hope and prom\nise come before him.\na\na\nSweet sleep, that gentle nurse of\nweary heart and limb, aided by the\nmurmur of the trickling stream, the\ngentle sighing of the wind throughout\nthe trees, and the soft flicker of the\ndying embers, wooes him into deep\nand peaceful slumber. Then, that\nskillful artist of the soul, steals into\nhis heart and paints another picture.\nAgain he sees that dear old eastern\nhome, his own little room in the loft\nDright with the loving touch of a\nmothers\'s care, that so fittingly takes\nthe place of luxury. He sits again\nat that long table, where love savors\nevery morsel of food. He wanders\nabout the barnyard and through the\nfields and orchards, he sees the dis\ntant wood, where he has gone so\noften, swimming, fishing, flowering\nand nutting, and where in childish\nfancy he has hunted wild beasts and\nwild men; fought deadly combat and\nexplored dense unknown region bur\nied in its thickets. Oh! the sacred\nThe Leader, Grangeville^ Low Price and Quality Store\nness of that acre of timber, that fQ\nseemed like the "barken wilderness ^\nto him then. He sees a little school\nhouse upon a neighboring hilltop,\nthat mountain of his childhood. He\nfeels the evening sunset glow, and\nhears the flocks and herds as\ncome within the fold. He sits about\nthe fireside cracking nuts and listen\ning to the tales of adventure, when\nAtlantic states poured their bravest\nsons over the Alleghanies a golden\nof\nstream to flood the vallies beyond\nHow these tales fired his imagina\ntion then, made him long for the time\nwhen he, too, might go out to con\nquer other lands.\nThe evening wears on, the aged\nsire takes the sacred book upon his\nlap, reads from its well worn pages\nand expounds its truth. Kneeling .\naround that quaint old room, where\nall is silent save the ticking of the\nclock and the crackling of the fire,\na fervent prayer ascends to heaven,\na flood of thanksgiving to him who\nhas so tenderly guided and protected\nthem through the rough voyage of\nlife, and an earnest petition seeking\nthe divine grace to rest upon those\nwho are to resume life\'s journey\nwhere he lays it down.\nWhat a sacredness to him has this\nthe\ning\ner\nhis\nto\nS\nhis\nî\nmost holy hour. No doubt knelt\nat that altar, no hypocisy there, no\nenveyings, no hatred, no malice, no\nfraud. Truly "this is a kingdom\nwhere love is the king."\nNo wonder such an oft repeated\nscene shou\'d be burned deeply within ;\nthe heart and soul of one so often\nprivileged to enjoy its blessed presence\nand become an ever vivid picture, an\neverlasting stimulus to a life of purity\nand honesty, mid the varied struggles\nof life. As it flits before his mem\nory, sleep sweetens and deepens, |\nand his face, cooled by the refreshing\nmountain breeze, glows in childish\ninnocence and purity.\nAgain he sees that dear old mother\nand feels her loving kiss and fond em\nbrace as he bids her good bye, turns\nhis back upon all that has been near a nd\ndear to him and faces the unknown\nwest. Again he feels the inspiring clasp\nof the father\'s hand and hears his sterl\ning farewell advice; he sees the little\nbrothers and sisters, bowed with\ngrief, as the hot streams trickling\ndown their faces tell of the sorrow\nburning at their hearts.\nStanding beside them with ashen\ncheek and tear dimmed eye, is the i\nsweet campanion of all these scenes,\nwhose heart throbs in unison with\nhis own, but whose mouth, though\nsilent, speaks louder than words.\nWhat a battle ground is this.\nWhat strength of heart, what stead\nfastness of purpose, what faith in the\neternal are arrayed like great Roman\nPhalanx. What clarion voice wafts\nfrom western shores, that cheers and\nstrengthens his heart to place his\nback upon such an inviting scene as\nthis and leads him on, on, on, ever\non, till it rests wearily here upon the\ncrest of the Rocky mountains.\nHere for the last time, for many\nyears at least, he looks back upon\nthe land so sacred to his memory.\nHere for the first time, he has looked\nupon the land of the hope of years.\nThe vision moves on, and he sees a\nnew home, sweet emblem of the old,\ngracing the sunny slopes of this\nborn land.\nnew\nHe sees himself sitting\nbeside the evening fireside, with the\ncompanion of his youth beside him;\nhe feels the loving little arms about\nhis neck and hears the sweet childish\n"tell me a story papa, tell\nHis heart throbs with\nfound joy and he strains his\ncatch the story so eagerly\nsought, but the voice hushes and the\nSlowly it seems to drift\nvoice say,\nme a story\'\'.\na new\near to\nvision dims,\nfarther and farther away, a mist seems\nNo there it\nfQ jt from vjcw\n^ can>t yQU see ; t?\naway> ye{ there js\nIt seems so far,\nBut something\nbetween it.

Again he\nmarshals his conquering forces,\nagain he turns his back upon all\nthat is near and dear to him, and\nfaces the west, surveying its bound\nless sweep of magnificence, sets his\nteeth, tightly clenches his fists, his\nmuscles rigid, he marches on, a\nmighty hero, a mighty victor, a\nmighty man.

Kieux, a well accredited writer\nthe Scientific American, however,\nfcsserts that the erosion of outcropping\nI auriferous veins of quartz does not\nI account for all deposits of metallic\nin\ngold.\nHe finds that some gold-hearing\nstrata shows no trace of quartz, but\nconsist wholly of clay with fragments\nof diorite or diabase and moreover so\nsituated as to preclude the existence\nof quartz veins.\nHe ha$ seen beds of streams be\ncome richer in gold after every rain,\nthough they show no trace of quartz\nFinally, in certain auriferous strata\nwhich contain much quartz, not a\nparticle of gold is found in the quartz,\nthough sejme gold occurs in the diabase\nwhich accompanies it.\nThis leads him to the logical con\nW\nCrosby\'s\nA Special just in\nfrom New York\n1200 yards of nice Zephyr\nGingham we are sell\ning at the yard\n5c\n10 yards to each customer\n100 p^iir Youths\' Calf Shoes\nsizes 8 to 12, Miller\'s\n$1.50 grade\nsale at\non\n$1.00\nThese offerings\nare Extra Special\nand you must call\npersonally to ob\ntain them.\nn\nQ\nelusion that the erosion of\nQuart/,\nenct, in these strata, of heavy basic\nrmks, containing diorite, amphibolic\nschist, and diabase,indicates that na\nnew theory,\nveins cannot be the sole source of\nauriferous alluvial strata and, further\nmore, that the almost\nconstant pres\ntive gold is one of the subsidiary i\ngredients of those rocks.\nAccording to this\ntherefore, certain of the heavy\ntive rocks have carried with them i\nm\nerup\nin\nl ^ e \' r eruption some of the gold exist\n\' n ^ m l ^ e mt \'tallic state in the central\nnucleus of the earth.\nAfter reaching the surface these\nroc ^ s were oxidized by contact with\na \' r anc ^ eroded by water, which\nwashed away the lighter materials and\nf ^ e heavier, including the gold.\nThis M. bieux regards as the true\ntheory of the formation of gold-bear\n\' n ~ a ^ u \' \' a l strata in general, the ero\nsion of quartz veins being only an\noccasional cause of the enrichment of\nthose strata.\nTHE AMERICAN GAME.\nThe snow still covers the daisies,\nthe "hoss fly" is absent from his\naccustomed haunts, and the single\nswallow still lingers in the equatorial\nzone, instead of trying to bull the sum\nmer market, yet the base ball microbe\nis getting in his deadly work and the\nfever is now ranging dangerously near\nthe one hundred mark in the veins of\nthe youthful camas eaters\nis now grooming her banana peelers\nand will soon be swaggering around\nwith a chip on one shoulder and a\ndefiant cast in her off eye, and it is\nunderstood that this tropical city has\nfell designs upon the championship\nlaurels which have heretofore adorned\nthe noble brows of the spheric artists\nof the Prairie country Such being\nthe condition of things in the inside\nand outside world, it is now becomes\nthe patriotic duty of the "rooters" to\nat once get an agitating move on\nthemselves, that they may not be\ncaught napping when the enemy\nmoves on their works.\n„ewiston\nPrincess Flour is made from high\nclass Turkey Red wheat.\n12\nCost of Our State Institutions.\nState Auditor Taylor recently filed\nwith the ways and means committee\nof the house of representatives a state\nment of the appropriations for and\nthe cost of maintenance of the var\nious public institutions of the state.\nFor the years 1907 and 1908 the ex\nincluding\nimprovements,\npense,\namounted to more than J81,000,000,\napportioned as follows:\nUniversity .\nLewiston Normal.\nAcademy of Idaho.\nAlbion Normal.\n§290,461.86\n..110,304.71\n...75,812.88\n...69,995.18\n100,543.15\nIndustrial Trainiug\nDeaf, Dumb, and Blind.. .34,641.70\n..56,244.33\n100,000.00\nSoldiers, Home.\nPenitentiary.\nIbaho Insane Asylum\n102,956.54\nNorthern Idaho Asylum. . 95,000.00\nSI, 033,960.35\n\'Total\nPrincess Flour contains all the good\npart of the wheat and none of the\nother part. 12\nArbor Day for Idaho.\nGov.
