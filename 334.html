After this inspection, com\nbined with my experieneo and observation ii thdi\nheart of the \'black belt" of tho south, covering\na period of nineteen years, I HAVE NO HESI\nTATION IN ASSERTING THAT THERE IS CONSTANT\nPROGRESS PROGRESS THAT IS TANGIBLE, VISIBLE.\nAny one who has had daily opportunity of studying my race at\nfirst hand cannot fail to gain the impression that there aro indis\nputable evidences that the race is settling down to a hard, earnest,\ncommon sense view of life; thut it Lt fust learning that a race, like\nan individual, must pay for everything that it gets, the price o\nbeginning ut the bottom of the social Meja and working up grad\nually, naturally, to the highest civilization. The exaggerated im\npressions that the first years of freedom naturally brought are giving\nway to an earnest, practical view of life and ita responsibilities.\nI want to try to teach the negro youth to take u high and impreg\nnable position.

LET US TEACH HIM THAT LOVE IS\nBETTER THAN HATRED, THAT MERCY IS BETTER\nTHAN CRUELTY, that it is more courageous to receive an insult\nand er.unre wrong than to give an insult and inflict a wrong; that\nif any one would help push him down he can help push him up. Let\nns teach the negro youth that any individual or race that cherishes\nrace hatred and practices cruelty is crushing aud narrowing the high\nest aspirations of the human soul.\nSOME MAY CALL THta COWARDICE.
