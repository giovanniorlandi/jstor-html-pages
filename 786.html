Mr. Wilson\'s speech should, be reach closely and studied by every, lover of liberty., All the papers which comment upon, the address have done well, as Alexander, the Great told che gymsophists., The writers seem to have been at, their best., The Baltimore American, among, other things, says:, The President rips aside the cloak, of duplicity, he enters into the infernal, star chamber of the spoilers, of the age and he brings forth and, holds exposed to the view of the, w\'\' acre and for the records of history, the most malevolent and infernally, conceived and prosecuted plot againjt, human freedom that the world has, ever known. Never in councils outside, of Hades and surpassing the, worst evidence of diabolica\'ism that, has been revealed in human affairs,, this peace plot, this high treason, against the race, stands out 7n the, burning sentences of Mir.

Were the, German plans to have been consummated, the world would have awakened, to the horrors now exposed by, Mr. Wilson. Brought to light- the, plot will shrivel and die as the saproots, of poison ivy are killed by the, ? direct rays of the sun. The world will, feel a profound debt of gratitude to, Mr. Wilson for crystallizing and giving, concrete expression to the alms, of Germany that many have apprehended, but could not nearly so well, express., The Washington Post contains a, sninted article which shnwsi the dec;, pel-ate straits of Germany after nearly, three year\'s war. It says:, President Wilson\'s address or yesterday, clearly exposes the reasons, why Germany is t;ow intriguing for, peace. Having executed part of the, plan for the conquest and consolidation, of a central European empire, extending from the North Sea to, Asia Minor, and having possession, of valuable trading material in, France, Belgium and Polam?, Ger-1, many finds its dream of world domination, shattered, new enomres rising,, domestic discontent and its re-!, sources diminishing. The German war], lords know better than any one else!, that their fortunes are on the ebb. |, They would make peace while there\', is something remaining to their ad- J, vantage. The world has passed the!, point where it was compelled to givej, ground to German militarism. The |, gains made by Germany are pr.wnly, attributable to the fact that the_, world was taken unawares bv the\', combined strength and barbarity of, Germany. Humanity was not awave, that a murderer nation was PTof.tlng, fv.iu!isi us ine. .uon lonniy supposed, that civilization had advanced beyond, the npro of the deliberate assassination, of nations. William 71, posed as a patron of the arts, boasted, of progress in peace, and concealed, his a! nature so craftilv that the, world did not suspect that tie was a, throwback to the nco of barbarism,, ifo nnd Ms associated assassTns were, nNio to build up a murder maf.Tno of, colossal proportions. and within a, month after the completion of the, Kiel oapni the macTnne was set ir>, motion. Franz .Tosef was the tool, ? throvioh wlvh the trap was snrun?., pnd ?ovbio was to be thp first victim., Tf the croat powers Tim* not, taken alarm William IT would have, dominated the world. ., "BI.UE BOOKS OF BUMS.", TVio stnfo council of rloforno ie ro., fciv:r)rr many list? of idler? hot ween, eighteen and fifty year? of aire from, the mayors of cities of Virginia, in, response to the request of Richard, Evelyn Tlyrd, vice chairman of the, council. While the number of resnonsfs, received constitute only a few, oi The number\' to. be\' ultimately - re., cvved. they\' indicate- that the people, of the state have been .aroused to the, and it. is beinr: taken scri- \', - --on sly. v In tirmierous. instances it has, boen noticed that men who have j, never done work of any amount be- j, fore, have suddenly taken op some!, duty on fanns, in factories or offi-1, ces. i, So determined is Mr. Byrd that J, there will be no idlers in Virginia,\',, as soon as he has the data before j, | him, request will be made of the va- J, j r\'ious town and county officials to use j, 1 the law in forcing these parasites to J, work. It is believed that in tne ma-1, jority of instances, where the local!, laws will not apply, that the state, vagrancy law can be used effectively,, and all persons reported will be prose.\', cuted accordingly j, It is estimated that there . are, several hundred well-dressed and able. |, bodied men in Virginia who make it !, their business to freqiient comer |, stores or other gathering places, who, engage in no work for the economic, welfare of the state. On the contrary, they play the role of consumers, rather than producers They drain J, the food supply instead of doing any. j, ! thing to build it up. Such a life is i, entirely at variance with the patriotic J, duty of every citizen at this time, j, Mr Byrd says, and if it continues j, there are ample laws on the statute j, books to correct it |, So cogent was the proposal of Mr. j, Byrd that the vagrancy laws of the, j State and the town ordinances against!, idling without visible means of support, be invoked fo\' round up loafers,, it is reported in Richmond the Mayor!, * * 1 3 1, j of a certain Virginia town searcrieu, the record of his life, decided to turn !, |, over a new leaf, took up his hoe and, went to work, This story, with every earmark of!, j authenticity, has just been received, { with great glee by the council, which,, through Mr. Byrd, requested all, I Mayors in the State to furnish it, j with a list of their street.corner, ! loafers who arc unable to show that, they have a way of earnin.tr an honest, 1 living. This particular Mayor started, at once to set his house in order., I j, I PRIZE FIGHT OF LONG AGO. \', i Fifty years ago yesterday a brutal, pi*i?.e fight tool; place at Aquia Creek,, j The "mill" was between Barney, i Aaron, who was John C. Ileenan\'s, ! trainer before he fought Tom Say res, j in England in 18G0, and a pugilist, ! named Collyer ., \' After the fight the steamboat carj, rying the principals, their friends, ; and spectators stopped at Alexan., dria. Some who read this may re1, i, j member seeing the pugilists with, \' their closed eyes and bloated faces, , seated upon the upper decks., Shortly after the close of the civil, i war, and while much of the dross of, humanity which had floated down, here during the four years\' conflict, j was still in evidence, a number of, , prize fights took place near Alexan1, dria. The pugilists and their many, j friends generally chartered the old, j steamer Manhattan, which was on., j crated upon the ferry between this, ; crty and Washington. The steamer, , left Washington on such occasions, ! after having- made the last trip on, . the ferry route, and the fight would, come off early the next morning at, J some isolated place on the Virginia, i side of the river. The steamer made, a stop at Alexandria, where such as, ; desired to witness the brutal diversion, went aboard., | Prize fights eventually became so, | cbjectional to Virginians, many of, i whom had but a short time before, I ceased lighting and were then en!, gaged in peaceful pursuits, that the, authorities put a stop to such pro., codurcs. Sheriffs on several occasions, appeared on the scene and arrested, principals and spectators., The Richmond Times-Dispatch in, its clippings of hall" a century ago, prints the following in regard to the, Aaron-Collyer fight:, "The piizc fight at Anuia Creek, yesterday was a brutal affair. The, crowd of 3,000 toughs was at times, boisterous and badly behaved Sixtyseven, rounds were fought, the mill, lasting one hour and forty-five minutes., Collycr fought desperately, while Aaron stood on the defensive,, playing the drop game. When the, sixty-eight round as called Coljyer\'s, strength failed him. and he threw, u.p the sponge. After the sponge, went up. Aaron fainted and was laid, side by side with Collycr. Aaron had, three ribs broken.", THE MODERN HEROD., Since Herod, so-called the Great, there has never been until now, among cilized men a human spirit, which waged war against the innocents., which treated with deliberate, contempt their sacred right to tender, consideration and immunity from, wrong.

It is for us to call this offender, of little ones to account. And, it will be poetic justice if we can, bring the perpetrator to the world\'s, judgment seat by a mighty fleet of, aeroplanes that will carry justice to, him from the skies. His ruthless, air attacks upon, women and children, will not be imitated, but we shall, use his own method in a larger and, I more legitimate way for his undoing., I And when International Justice takes, I her seat on the bench the dead chil!, dren of the Lusitania and the little, ones of the English streets and, school houses will form a multitude, | of unanswerable witnesses ., !

Even for years before 188",, the statistics, as complied by the commissioners, of the revenue and for, warded to the auditor, are by 110, me.-r.s complete.
