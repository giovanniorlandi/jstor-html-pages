        <pre>['Government Policy Options: Implications \nfor Weed Management \nJohn E. Ikerd \nResearch Question \nLiterature Summary \nStudy Description \nResults \nWhat impact do government policies have on weed management alternatives? \nHow might future changes in government policies affect farmers’ weed man- \nagement strategies? Government programs provide economic incentives for \nfarmers to plant or not plant specific crops and to use or not use specific farm- \ning methods. Policy impacts on farming methods may be a reflection of a pre- \nvailing political philosophy rather than of any single policy or manageable set \nof policies that might be modeled and simulated. The purpose of this paper is to \nexamine the impacts of past changes in agricultural policies on farming meth- \nods in general, and on weed management strategies in particular, and to draw \nsome conclusions regarding potential changes in both policies and weed man- \nagement strategies in the future. \nThe mechanization of U.S. agriculture following World War I1 was accompa- \nnied by development and widespread use of herbicides. Herbicide costs per \nacre of harvested cropland increased from less than $0.30/acre in 1950 to more \nthan $2.50/acre in 1985. Total pesticide use, in terms of total pounds of active \ningredients, nearly tripled between 1964 and 1980 alone. Much of the increased \nreliance on herbicides to control weeds can be attributed to falling costs of her- \nbicides relative to other means of weed control. Pesticide costs were only about \none-third as high, relative to machinery, labor, or fuel costs in 1980 as in 1965. \nHerbicide costs rose from less than one-third to more than two-thirds of total \nexpenditures on pesticide between 1960 and 1985. Commercial herbicides have \nbecome the American farmer’s major defense against losses of crops to weeds. \nMajor developments and trends in U.S. agricultural policy are correlated with \nconcurrent changes in predominant methods for managing weeds on U.S. farms. \nSimultaneous changes in other factors, including availability, costs, and effec- \ntiveness of commercial herbicides, are taken into consideration. The trend \ntoward industrialization in the general economy was matched with the trend \ntoward larger, more specialized farming operations, and with increased reliance \non commercial herbicides as the predominant means of managing weeds. The \nconcept of sustainable agriculture is defined and its potential impacts on future \nagricultural policy and consequent potential impacts on farmers’ weed manage- \nment strategies are explored. \nThe rapid rise in pesticide use can be as easily attributed to changing economic \nincentives and emerging new chemical technologies as to changes in agricultur- \nal policies. However, farm policies may have added significantly to farmers’ \neconomic incentives by providing the economic security farmers needed to \nabandon diversified crop and livestock operations in favor of large-scale, spe- \ncialized, mechanized system of farming. It cannot be determined with certainty \nwhether agrichemical technologies were developed in response to policy incen- \ntives for specialization, or whether specialization was an economic response to \nthe emerging agrichemical technologies. The most logical conclusion would \nseem to be that industrialization of the U.S. economy, new agrichemical tech- \nnologies, and government farm policies have been mutually supportive in \nchanging the fundamental nature of U.S. farms and the methods used by U.S. \nfarmers to manage weeds. \nFull scientific article from which this summary was written begins on page 491 of this issue. \nJ.

Sustainable agriculture has emerged as a major \npublic issue during a period when the U.S. economy in general has been shift- \ning from reliance on manufacturing to reliance on service and information \nbased enterprises. Similar changes may be forthcoming in agriculture. \nDiversification, integration, and individualization may be key weed manage- \nment concepts during the emerging post-industrial era. \n438 J.

Ikerd* \nGovernment farm programs directly and indirectly affect \nthe economic viability of alternative systems of farming, and \nthus affect farmers’ choices among alternative weed manage- \nment strategies. The primary objective of farm policy since the \n1930s has been to increase agricultural productivity, both for \nthe short run benefit of farmers and the long run benefit of \nfood and fiber consumers. Past policies have supported and \nsubsidized highly specialized systems of farming that are \ninherently dependent on commercial chemicals for weed con- \ntrol. A shift in public priorities toward agricultural sustain- \nability, which balances the goals of productivity with resource \nconservation and environmental protection, is changing gov- \nernment farm programs. Future farm policies are likely to sup- \nport more diverse systems of farming and more integrated sys- \ntems of weed management. \nOVERNMENT POLICIES and programs have important G impacts on the comparative economics of alternative \nsystems of farming. American agriculture today is, in no \nsmall part, a reflection of government policies and programs \nof the past. Changing human values and expanding technol- \nogy have dictated the fundamental nature of methodological \nchanges in agriculture, as in other segments of the economy. \nAs the USA has evolved from an agrarian to an industrial \nsociety, the fhdamental paradigm for U.S. agriculture has \nevolved from pastoral to industrial as well. However, the \nenvironmental, economic, and social consequences of \nchanges in farming methods also reflect the nature of spe- \ncific public policies chosen to support the industrialization \nprocess. \nThe purpose of this paper is to examine the impacts of \nagricultural policies on farming methods in general and on \nweed management strategies in particular. Policy impacts on \nfarming methods are more a reflection of a dominant politi- \ncal philosophy than of any single policy or set of policies \nthat might be modeled and simulated. For this reason, the \nconclusions reached in this paper are based on deductive \nreasoning rather than model-based simulations of alternative \nfarming systems under alternative policy scenarios. \nPOLICIES AFFECTING FARMING SYSTEMS \nGovernment programs designed to stabilize commodity \nprices have been the most costly, and perhaps the most \nimportant, U.S. agricultural policies of the past. Farmers’ \nprices for program commodities such as corn (Zea mays L.), \nwheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum \nL.), and peanuts (Arachis hypogea L.) have been supported \nby various means to ensure that prices will not persist below \nlevels predetermined by agricultural policy.

Agric. 9:491-495 (1996). \ners have been required to comply with various supply con- \ntrol programs to reduce surpluses periodically resulting \nfrom prices set above market clearing levels. Various food \ndistribution programs, including the school lunch and food \nstamp programs, were justified, at least in part, as a means \nof using surplus farm commodities. The current export \nenhancement program is the most recent effort to remove \nsurplus agricultural production from U.S. markets. \nVarious land retirement programs, such as the current \nAcreage Reduction Program and Conservation Reserve \nProgram (CRP), were designed to control production and \nreduce government costs of supporting prices for farm com- \nmodities. The CRP reflects a compromise between political \nforces supporting price stabilization and those supporting \nsoil conservation. Land removed from production by the \nCRP had to be classified as highly erodible. \nSome soil and water conservation programs are essen- \ntially separate from commodity programs. The primary \nemphasis of policies carried out by the Natural Resource \nConservation Service of USDA has been to conserve soil \nand water resources and to protect water quality. These pro- \ngrams, however, have been implemented by means that con- \nsistently put a high priority on maintaining or increasing \nagricultural production levels. Other types of government \nprograms -such as farmer cooperatives, farm credit, feder- \nal crop insurance, and farm tax policies-also have signifi- \ncant impacts on the agricultural economy in general and on \nfarmers’ choices among alternative farming methods. \nFinally, publicly funded research and education also have \nhelped to shape the fundamental nature of today’s agricul- \ntural economy. The primary focus of publicly funded \nresearch and education has been on improving production \nefficiency. Advances in research based technology has pro- \nvided short run profit opportunities for innovative farmers, \nbut the primary long run benefits have accrued to consumers \nin terms of lower prices for food and fiber. This emphasis on \ntechnological innovation as a means of increasing produc- \ntivity has had important implications for alternative methods \nof farming, including weed management alternatives. \nTHE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE \nOF AGRICULTURAL POLICY \nThe fundamental purpose of public policy is to resolve \ninherent conflicts between the short run interests of individ- \nuals, and the long run interests of society. In many cases, \nprofit incentives derived from free market prices provide \nadequate motivation for individuals to act in ways that are \nalso in the best interest of society. In other cases, free mar- \nket incentives encourage, or even force, individuals to act in \nways that are in conflict with the long run interest of the \nlarger society. Thus, society, through the public policy \nprocess, must provide incentives, in the form of subsidies, \nAbbreviations: CRP, Conservation Reserve Program; EF. ., Environmental \nProtection Agency; IPM, integrated crop management. \nJ. Prod. Agric., Vol. 9, no. 4, 1996 491 \n', 'penalties, or regulations, for individuals to make ,decisions \nthat are consistent with the welfare of society. \nHistorically, agricultural policies have provided incen- \ntives for individual farmers to support the industrialization \nof the U.S. economy, regardless of stated or intended objec- \ntives. At the turn of the century, a large proportion of the U.S \nwork force was engaged in farming, and a large proportion \nof consumer income was spent for food and fiber. Success \nof the industrialization process was dependent upon the \navailability of people to work in the factories, and on dis- \ncretionary income that consumers could use to buy the \nthings the factories would produce. Agriculture had to be \nmade more productive and efficient to reduce its claim on \nconsumers’ income, and to free farmers and their families to \nwork in the factories and offices of an industrial economy. \nGovernment programs for agriculture were designed to \nincrease agricultural productivity by substituting mecha- \nnization for farm labor and industrial technology for man- \nagement intensive farming methods. Commodity price sta- \nbilization programs reduced the risks inherent in agricultur- \nal markets and allowed farmers to make long term invest- \nments in specialized farm equipment, production facilities, \nand technical know how. Without price support programs, \nfarmers would have been forced to maintain diversified \nfarming systems as they would have been unable to absorb \nthe financial risks of large commodity-specific capital \ninvestments. \nFarm credit programs subsidized capital investment in \nagriculture and reduced the need for farm labor and individ- \nualized farm management. In general, those who borrowed \nand invested most, benefited most, leaving those who \ninvested less aggressively at a competitive disadvantage. \nSubsidized credit made capital investment in agriculture \npossible even during long periods of chronically depressed \nfarm incomes. The Farmers Home Administration, the \nlender of last resort, historically has played a more impor- \ntant role in moving farmers out of agriculture than in keep- \ning them in agriculture. \nPreferential taxes further added to farmers’ incentives to \ninvest in new machinery and equipment. Tax laws also \nencouraged large farmers and outside investors in higher tax \nbrackets to buy farmland as a hedge against inflation. Land \nspeculation supported farm land prices and encouraged con- \nsolidation. Farmers specialized and mechanized in order to \nachieve the economic efficiencies from large scale agricul- \ntural production. \nSoil and water conservation programs have also encour- \naged the trend toward large scale specialized production. \nGovernment cost sharing on terraces and various other soil \nand water conservation structures were of the greatest bene- \nfit to those who were willing and able to match government \nfunds with money of their own. Far less emphasis was \nplaced on using crop rotations, strip cropping, cover crops, \nor simply leaving highly erodible lands under permanent \ngroundcover. In fact, many soil conservation programs \nencouraged farmers to abandon such cultural practices and \nmove toward more intensive, more specialized systems of \nmonocropping. \nPublicly funded research and education developed new \ntechnologies that substitute mechanization for farm labor \nand commercial inputs for individualized management. \n’ \nResearch and educational institutions have contended that \ntheir search for new technologies has been scale-neutral. \nHowever, few would deny that the primary focus of agricul- \ntural research has been on developing technologies to \nincrease agricultural productivity. Productivity has been \nmeasured in terms of yields per acre of land, output per \nfarmer, and overall economic costs of production. This \nfocus on productivity and associated measures of success \nundeniably have affected the research and education agenda \nand, thus, have affected the economic viability of alternative \nfarming methods. \nThe ultimate objective of publicly funded programs in \nagricultural research and education, resource conservation, \nfarm credit, marketing, and price stabilization has been to \nreduce consumer costs of food and fiber, and to support eco- \nnomic progress of the nation. The most efficient means of \nachieving those objectives has been through implementing \nindustrial strategies such as specialization, mechanization, \nroutinization, and mass production of agricultural com- \nmodities. The objective was not necessarily to industrialize \nagriculture, but rather to make agriculture more efficient. \nOpportunities to reduce the physical toil of farming and to \nrealize short run profits provided farmers with the motiva- \ntion to adopt cost-reducing, production-expanding produc- \ntion technologies. However, farm policies of the past have \nconsistently supported industrialization as a means to the \nend of a more productive agriculture that would allow fewer \nfarmers to produce more food and fiber at a lower cost to \nconsumers. \nIMPACTS OF WEED MANAGEMENT \nSTRATEGIES \nWeed management strategies have played a key role. in \nthe industrialization of U.S. agriculture. Thus, changes in \nfarmers’ weed management strategies can be logically \nlinked to changes in agricultural policies and changing tech- \nnology. It is impossible to statistically distinguish cause \nfrom effect among the complex relationships that have \ntransformed the pastoral agriculture of the early 1900s into \nthe industrial agriculture of today. But, the correlations \namong changes are quite clear. \nIn the early years of the century, clean tillage and crop \nrotations were a popular means of managing weed competi- \ntion. The moldboard plow, even when horse-drawn, allowed \nfarmers to bury residue and weed seeds produced from the \nprevious year. Crops were rotated in specific sequences to \ndiscourage overabundant reproduction of certain weed \nspecies that might have thrived had any single crop been \nproduced year after year on the same field. Crop rotation \nallowed times of tillage, cultivation, and harvest to be \naltered from year to year in ways that prevented the exces- \nsive build-up and dominance of particular weed species. \nHand weeding or hoeing were important means of coping \nwith weeds that could not be controlled through other cul- \ntural practices. \nBy mid-century, agricultural mechanization had made \ncultural weed management practices much more efficient. \nTractors enabled the farmer to clean till and cultivate much \nfaster. Mechanized weed control also was far less toilsome, \n492 J. Prod. Agric., Vol. 9, no. 4, 1996 \n', 'and in many cases more effective, than weeding by hand, \nhoe, or horse. \nThe mechanization of U.S. agriculture following World \nWar I1 was accompanied by the development and wide- \nspread use of synthetic chemical herbicides. Herbicide costs \nper acre of harvested cropland (including cropland on which \nno herbicides were applied) increased from less than \n$0.30/acre in 1950 to more than $2.50/acre in 1985 \n(Miranowski and Carlson, 1993). Total pesticide use, in \nterms of total pound of active ingredients, nearly tripled \nbetween 1964 and 1980 alone (Miranowski and Carlson, \n1993). Much of the increased reliance on herbicides to con- \ntrol weeds can be attributed to falling costs of herbicides rel- \native to other means of weed control. Pesticide costs were \nonly about one-third as high, relative to machinery, labor, or \nfuel costs in 1980 as in 1965 (Miranowski and Carlson, \n1993). Herbicide costs rose from less than one-third to more \nthan two-thirds of total expenditures on pesticide between \n1960 and 1985 (Miranowski and Carlson, 1993). \nThe rapid rise in pesticide use might be attributed to \nchanging economic incentives and emerging chemical tech- \nnology as well as to agricultural policies. Farm policies, \nhowever, added significantly to farmers’ economic incen- \ntives by providing the economic security they needed to \nabandon diversified crop and livestock operations in favor \nof large-scale, specialized, mechanized systems of farming. \nIt is impossible to determine whether agrichemical tech- \nnologies were developed in response of policy-driven incen- \ntives for specialization, or whether specialization was an \neconomic response to emerging agrichemical technologies. \nIt is clear that chemical technologies and public policies \nworked hand-in-hand to encourage agricultural specializa- \ntion. \nRegardless of the direction of cause and effect between \npolicy and technology, the availability of low-cost, effective \ncommercial herbicides, and agricultural policies that sup- \nported large-scale, specialized farming were both important \nfactors in the evolution of U.S. agriculture from the 1950s \nthrough the mid 1980s. The industrialization of U.S. agri- \nculture would have been difficult, if not impossible, without \nsupportive agricultural policies and low-cost, effective com- \nmercial herbicides. \nFORCES FOR CHANGE IN AGRICULTURAL \nPOLICIES \nAgriculture has fulfilled its public mandate for the twen- \ntieth century. Less than two percent of the U.S. population is \nclassified as farmers. The percentage of consumer income \nclaimed by food and fiber has dropped dramatically, with \nless than 12% of average consumer income spent for food \ntoday (USDA, 1994). Lower income consumers spend a \nhigher percentage of their incomes for food. There is a \ngrowing realization, however, that problems of poverty can- \nnot be solved with cheap food. \nToday, farmers receive only about $0.20 of each dollar \nspent for food. The remaining $0.80 goes to marketing \nfirms. In addition, farmers keep only about $0.10 of each \ndollar (Dunham, 1994). The other $0.10 pays for inputs \nincluding rent, hired labor, and interest on borrowed money. \nMargins between input costs and commodity prices have \nbeen squeezed to the point that there is very little left. \nThe agricultural policy mandate of the past has been ful- \nfilled. Rising ecological risks and social costs of M e r  \nagricultural industrialization must now be weighed against \nrapidly disappearing economic and social benefits of poli- \ncies that continue to support industrial methods of farming. \nSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE: \nTHE NEW PUBLIC MANDATE \nThe changes in farming methods that account for most of \nthe past increases in agricultural productivity have now \nbecome the primary source of environmental and social con- \ncerns regarding long run agricultural sustainability. \nThe Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of \n1990 defines sustainable agriculture as “an integrated sys- \ntem of plant and animal production practices having a site- \nspecific application that will, over the long-term: (i) satisfy \nhuman food and fiber needs; (ii) enhance environmental \nquality and the natural resource base upon which the agri- \nculture economy depends; (iii) make the most efficient use \nof nonrenewable resources and on-farm resources and inte- \ngrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles and con- \ntrols; (iv) sustain the economic viability of farm operations; \nand (v) enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as \na whole (U.S. Congress, 1990).” \nThe concept of sustainability represents a new public \npolicy mandate for agriculture. Agricultural policies of the \npast have been focused on satisfying human food and fiber \nneeds, which is only one of the multiple objectives of agri- \ncultural sustainability. Society has little more to gain from \nfurther increases in farm level productivity. An additional \n50% increase in farm level efficiency would reduce con- \nsumer food costs by less than 5%, even if the total cost sav- \nings were passed on to consumers in the form of lower food \nprices. Cutting the farmer’s dime of the food dollar in half \ncould only save the consumer a nickel. Consumers don’t \nwant their food costs to climb back to percentage levels of a \nfew decades ago, but there is little prospect for fkther price \ndeclines, at least not as a result of increasing agricultural \nproductivity. Long run sustainability of food production has \nreplaced cheap food as a primary public concern. \nThe natural resource and environmental concerns reflect- \ned in the sustainable agriculture issue are associated primar- \nily with industrial methods of agricultural production. \nPesticides and fertilizers, which are absolute necessities for \nlarge-scale, specialized agricultural production, are primary \ntargets for those concerned with the negative environmental \nimpacts of agriculture. Commercial agricultural chemicals \nare routinely detected in groundwater, lakes, and streams \nthrough periodic monitoring. Scientists disagree on the \nextent and magnitude of water quality risks associated with \nindustrial farming practices. There is no way scientists can \nprove or disprove the nature of such risks to the satisfaction \nof the general public, at least not in the foreseeable future. \nFor example, after decades of scientific inquiry, the health \nimplications of a single substance, nicotine, remains the \nsubject of scientific debate as people continue to smoke. It \nwill take decades, if not centuries, to accurately assess the \nenvironmental risks associated with hundreds of agricultur- \nJ. Prod. Agric., Vol. 9, no. 4, 1996 493 \n', 'al compounds in their thousands of possible combinations \nand derivatives. In the interim, most would agree that water \nquality is an issue that must be addressed by U.S. farmers if \nthey are to maintain the confidence and support of U.S. con- \nsumers and taxpayers. \nA sustainable agriculture must be sustained by economi- \ncally viable farming operations. By this measure, agricultur- \nal programs of the past have been a failure. The 1890 U.S. \nCensus indicated that more than 22 million people, 40% of \nthe population, lived on farms. A hundred years later, only \n4.6 million people, less than 2% of total U.S. population, \nlive on farms (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1989). \nAgriculture was not economically viable for the 15 million \npeople who had to find something else to do for a living. In \naddition, those living on farms today earn more than half of \ntheir income from nonfarm sources. Claims that those farm- \ning today will benefit from still further reductions in costs of \nfarm-based production are no longer credible. As the aver- \nage size of U.S. farms continues to rise, there will be fewer \nand fewer economically viable farming operations, by defi- \nnition. The battle to survive by reducing production costs \nthrough increasing the scale of farming operations is a bat- \ntle that fewer and fewer farmers can possibly win. \nFarm policy rhetoric of the past often has supported \npreservation of family farms and restoration of farm prof- \nitability. Every f m  bill passed by the U.S. Congress since \nthe 1930s has included specific language indicating a com- \nmitment of the U.S. government to the survival of family \nfarms. However, the consequences of farm policies have \nbeen the exact opposite for most farm families. \nObviously, the industrialization of agriculture has not \nenhanced the quality of life for those who were forced out of \nagriculture and failed to find equally desirable occupations \nelsewhere. Nor has it helped the many others who choose to \nlive and work in rural, agricultural communities. Arguments \ncan be made as to whether off-farm opportunities “pulled” \nfarmers off farms and out of rural areas or whether they \nwere “pushed” by the lack of opportunities on farms and in \nrural communities. There can, however, be no argument \nconcerning the necessity of a persistent gap between quality \nof life-physical, social, and economic-in farming and \nrural life compared with industrial work and urban life. If \nopportunities on farms had kept pace with off-farm oppor- \ntunities, people would have had no incentive to leave farms \nand rural communities to go to work in the factories and \noffices in urban centers. \nThe viability of a rural community is more a reflection of \nthe personal success of its people than of the level of output \nof its farms or local businesses. As farm families have aban- \ndoned their farms, rural communities in agricultural areas \nhave decayed economically and socially, and many have \nwithered and died. \nTHE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA \nFOR THE 1995 FARM BILL \nSoil conservation has dominated the environmental poli- \ncy agenda for U.S. agriculture since conservation compli- \nance and the conservation reserve programs were written \ninto the Food Security Act of 1985. Conservation compli- \nance has resulted in dramatic changes in tillage systems, and \n494 J. Prod. Agric., Vol. 9, no. 4, 1996 \nconsequently, in methods of weed control. For example \nbetween 1988 and 1992, the percentage of corn acres tilled \nby moldboard plow, leaving an estimated 2% residue cover, \ndropped from 20% to 12%. The percentage of mulch-till, \nridge-till, and no-till combined, leaving 38 to 65% residue, \nincreased from 21% to 39% of total corn acres (Bull, 1994). \nFarmers who reduce tillage to conserve soil obviously \nmust change their methods of weed control. Less reliance on \ntillage would seem to imply greater reliance on herbicides. \nHowever, herbicide use, in terms of pounds of active ingre- \ndients, has declined since the mid 1980s. Some of the \ndecline is due to cropland idled by government programs. In \naddition, many of the newer materials are applied at rates \nmeasured in ounces or grams per acre rather than the pounds \nper acre use rates common for many of the older com- \npounds. \nHerbicides were applied on 97% of corn acreage sur- \nveyed in 1992 (Delvo, 1994). However, a 1992 survey of \nfarmers in the corn belt indicated farmers using conserva- \ntion tillage used no more pesticides than did farmers using \nconventional tillage (Bull et.al., 1993). Pure no-till farming \nrequires increased herbicide use to control weeds in many \ncrops, but uses different compounds that may be safer than \nthose used in conventional tillage systems of the past. In \nfact, many of the newer compounds used in all types of \nweed management systems today were developed specifi- \ncally to reduce environmental risks. \nSoil conservation issues will continue to be important in \nthe 1995 farm bill debate. Conservation debates will center \non whether the conservation compliance program has effec- \ntively reduced soil loss, and whether farmers will have suf- \nficient positive program incentives to offset their costs of \ncompliance in the years ahead. Budget or government cost \nconstraints will dominate debate surrounding continuation \nof the conservation reserve program. \nThe concept of agricultural sustainability will surface in \na variety of proposals, not necessarily bearing the sustain- \nability label, during the policy debates leading up to a new \nfarm bill in 1995. In general, the sustainable agriculture pol- \nicy agenda will require that current commodity-based pro- \ngrams be decoupled from their current objective of price sta- \nbilization and supply management, and recoupled to the \nmultiple objectives of agricultural sustainability. \nDecoupling could be accomplished by several means \nincluding continued reductions in effective target and loan \nprices through increases in unpaid or flexible base acres. \nSuch actions would cause more farmers to drop out of gov- \nernment programs, choosing to rely instead on market \nincentives to guide their production decisions. However, \nfarmers who drop out of commodity programs will no \nlonger be subject to conservation compliance provisions or \nother requirements designed to protect the environment. \nAlternative means will need to be devised to recouple \ngovernment programs to objectives of the emerging envi- \nronmental policy agenda. Some of the options being dis- \ncussed include universal environmental compliance, green \npayments, and environmental easements (Tweeten and \nCramer, 1994). Environmental compliance would be similar \nto conservation compliance in that each farm identified as \nan environmental hazard would be required to develop and \nimplement an environmental compliance plan. Such plans \n', "would be expected to protect water quality and air quality as\nwell as conserve soil and water. A variety of incentives and\npenalties would have to be devised to induce farmer participation\nin such a program.\nEach farm's environmental compliance plan would be\nindividualistic and site specific. These plans would need to\nprovide an estimate of impacts on farm profits, as well as\nimpacts on the environment, for a specific farmer and farm.\nThe new mandate could dictate that a portion of publicly\nfunded research and education programs be diverted from\ntechnology development and transferred to support integrated\nsystems approaches to managing diversified, site-specif-\nic farming operations. Farmers and policymakers alike must\ncontinue to search for economically viable and environmentally\nsound systems of farming.\nGreen payments could be used to replace declining commodity\nprogram payments as a carrot to entice farmers to\nparticipate in a new environmental compliance program.\nInitially, eligibility for green payments, at least in some\ncases, might be linked to a farmer's current government program\neligibility in order to ease the transition. Green pay-\nments, however, unlike commodity program payments, ultimately\nwould focus solely on reducing environmental risks.\nIt may not be possible to keep some land in production\nwithout incurring unacceptable environmental or economic\nrisks. Public law requires that farmers be compensated for\nany economic losses associated with public restrictions on\ntheir use of private lands. Thus, permanent environmental\neasements may eventually replace the current CRP as a\nmeans of permanently removing land from uses that would\nput the environment, including soil, water, or air, at risk.\nFUTURE IMPACTS ON WEED MANAGEMENT\nThe concepts of environmental compliance would seem\nto support a diverse set of weed management practices for\nthe future. Weed management strategies would have to be\ntailored to each farm and farmer. The environmental and\neconomic risks associated with herbicide use are not a function\nof characteristics of the herbicide alone. Risks can be\naffected by method, timing, and level of herbicide application,\nand by the soil type or specific site where it is applied.\nThus, strategies for managing a specific weed in a specific\ncrop may differ from farm to farm, and from farmer to\nfarmer, even for similar soils and sites.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may play a\neven greater role in farmers' weed management strategies of\nthe future. The EPA has set a goal of having integrated pest\nmanagement (IPM) in practice on 75% of all crop acres by\nthe end of the decade. This goal would seem to fit well with\nan environmental compliance approach. Farms with an\nacceptable environmental compliance plan would presumably\nbe required to have an acceptable IPM plan. The con-\ncept of IPM encompasses a wide diversity of chemical,\nmechanical, and cultural methods of weed control, tailored\nto fit a specific production situation. A significant portion of\nthe funds for green payments, and publicly funded research\nneeded to implement and maintain environmental compliance,\ncould come through the EPA rather than the USDA.\nPreoccupation of the U.S. Congress with efforts to balance\nthe federal budget and decentralize government pro-\ngrams diverted attention from the environmental agenda\nduring the 1995 farm bill debate. However, the continued\ndismantling of commodity-based programs, in response\nbudget pressures, helps set the stage for a new farm policy\nagenda. Recoupling agricultural policy with environmental\nobjectives remains on the public policy agenda for agriculture\nin the future.\nIn summary, the key concepts for farmers' weed management\nstrategies of the future would seem to be diversity,\nintegration, and individuality. A diverse set of alternative\nweed control practices will have to be considered, and integrated\nto fit the individual needs of specific farms and farm-\ners. Some fanners will rely on government agencies to provide\ninformation and assistance needed to develop an\nacceptable weed management strategy for their farms.\nOthers will rely on private consultants to develop plans that\nfulfill requirements of environmental compliance. Others\nwill prefer to devise their own weed management strategies\nand develop their own environmental plans.\nIn the future, publicly funded weed management research\nand education programs will have to shift from technology\ndevelopment and transfer to support of integrated systems of\nweed management that are site-specific and individualistic.\nScientists in the Land Grant university systems will have\nopportunities to support other government agencies, private\nconsultants, and individual farmers as they attempt to fulfill\nthe public mandate for an agriculture that is economically\nviable, environmentally sound, socially acceptable, and thus\nsustainable over time.\n"]</pre>
