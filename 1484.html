It\nis dry up here, usually dry on the\nrange. That does not matter to the\nfarmers along the Tellowstone, a\nmagnificent river, a beaartifjil river,\nsweeping a refreshing mass of cool,\nclear w^ter toward Its ally the Mis\xad\nsouri, ^rhlcb it joinp in Dakota.\nDitches come out of the Yellowstone,\nditches never to be dried. All about\nBillings the alfalfa fields come, with\ntheir coolneBs, their refreshing green\xad\nness, their delicate perfumes. Already\nmen are cutting their third crops,\nsom^of them, so that they may get\nfour crops this year,, .That ,is all.w$\ncan do In OhioO* ^?V,\nThere is a great new cantfl being\ntaken out that will cover an Immense\nbody of iand on the north side of the\nriver huge steam dredge is tak\xad\ning out the earth and floating in the\nchannel it excavates, keeps its breast\npushed always against the uncut earth.\nThis canal will make many homes\nwhere now not much but little short\ndesert grasses grow. I drove-out to\nsee this new canal. Men are toiling\nin the depths of the mountain, tunnel\xad\ning from each side in firm faith that\ntheir holes will come togetber and the\nwat6r flow through in a few more\nweeks. Beyond the tunnel there a\nlong and* high trestle, then a rock put\nof-a half mile, then the dry bench is\nreached. It is a vast level piain, per\xad\nhaps a hundred feet above the river\nflats a barren, dusty plain, shimmer\xad\ning with heatv There is not a tree nor\na shrub on it, but already there are\ndotted a few tiny new houses some\nsettlers have come tjiey are getting\nready for the water. Next year this\nbarren plain will be green with waving\ngrain, and in two years alfalfa stacks\nwill dot it all over, and in four the\nhomes will be hidden by trees. Such\nis the magic of water this land.\nMontana is dry. It has never been\nso dry and hot before, so they tell us.\nThe water holes are dried up and\nranchers are putting in wells in some\nplaces. This has not hurt the irrigat\xad\ned crops, that is the best thing about\nan irrigated land. And this heat is\ngood. A land\'s production is meas\xad\nured by the sum of its water and the\nsum of its beat. Soil counts, but\nwater and heat are the main things.\nThere is a man here at Billings\nnamed I. D." O\'Donnell. He came here\nfrom Michigan a good many years ago.\nMr" O\'Donnell began farming up the\nriver on a bench abovei Billings. He\nplanted alfalfa. He watched alfalfa\ngrow,: studied alfalfa, lay awake nights\nthinking about alfalfa, worked day\xad\ntimes sowing more alfalfa and makibg\nalfalfa hay. Then he took up the mat\xad\nter of using alfalfa. He built a great\nfeeding plant, a warm shed, an im\xad\nmense yard surrounded by a high\nfencei for :wind breaK He used this\nfor a time, then outgrew it and moved\ndown into t$e brush and trees and\nbuilt\' larger Seeding yards-" without\nsheds. Sheds were not so necessary\nhere where it never rains in winter\nand snow® lita^ bnt shelter from\nwind was jgood.^ Mr. O\'Donnell learn**\nIfanQ^n nuUoaa an a^proprktion of\n|M,000 an^i it vnm tbalt of\nl^feirty different Itetpit numerated the\ncot»c» bf tbft dty VtJt »1,50) mt\nipld« fpr poMoe, 18,WO for tot«r«\niTOO Uor «Ankteg fund, $l 200 for oil that it shoald ooiBt four tteee as much son tor a year, btott tbe Bguree shot^\n~|P» to#,^QO.fof «tT6«tmi 4%» city Mandtom it doeftitint nm.

They are\nbreeding mpre and more of their own\ncattle here.\' This is safer than it once\nwas for there is so much.alfalfa In\ntt}e country now. Paul McCormick, a\nveteran cattleman, has a fine alfalfa\nranch here where he cuts thousands of\ntons of alfalfa. He has a barn, too,\nthat is a model for any land, and there\nhe is prepared to feed 2,000 calves or\nwhatever be finds needs attention.\nThe soil clay loam, sometimes\n.sandy".,/ There is some alkali in spots\nbut tho ltarmerg are learning how to\nsubdue this and make alfalfa grow on\nit. The great abundance of water\nmakes men\' careless in Its qae and\n\'some fields suffer from too copious\nirrigation. Near Billings area lot of.\nsmall ftutms, flrom 1 to 50\nhave neat homes- and trees are begin\xad\nning to grow. "That farm is own\nby an Iowa man, He has been bei\ntwo yeafg he wanted to sell last fall\nbut now you could not buy him cut,"\n-1\nThe place bad a pretty new cottage^*\nand good\' little barn.

Alfalfa harvest is therefore les^\nexciting than with us there is no\nwatching clouds no fear of rain. "We\nget three or four euttings," said Mr,-\'\nO\'DonnelL "The first one should\n-come off about June 15th, the next in\nexactly 30 days, the third in about 45\ndayfs. I have been in the habit of\nrushing my. first wop off, putting in\neight mowers and cutting down about\n400 acres in four days, then getting it\nin bunches and stack at once. This\nprompt cutting of tbe first crop is es^\n^ential to a heavy second crop early\nenough to allow the third fo come on\nwell."\nI do not believe I ever saw so much\nalfalfa in any other valley in tbe\nworld. Most other places impress\nyou as getting ready to grow alfalfa,\nthese people, grow it. Hesper Farm,\nMr. O\'Connell\'s place, had about a\nhundred big staclsfs on it yesterday\nand more to follow. This is the first\nland I have ever seen where alfalfa\nwould literally take the country.\nTimothy grows well here, making\nthree tons to the acre sometimes. At\nHesper Farm Mr. O\'Donnell showed\nine a great timothy meadow where on\nthe upper side alfalfa bad started to\ngrow. There were bunches of it here\nand there scattered all over the field.\nA little farther on he showed me a\nlovely, alfalfa field. \'\'This field began\nas that one bas begun—first a little\nsprinkling of alfalfa near the ditch,\nthen steadily it spread all over the\nfield until at last I dteked it one\nspring and that covered the self-sown\nseed and the result is as you see a\nspl&nldid field of though there\nis yet a good deal of timothy in the\nfiifst cutting."\nAlfalfa up here makes yields as\nhigh as eight tons per acre. Perhaps\nfive tons is the average. Mr. O\'Don\xad\nnell pointed out to me one quarter\nsection that had produced more than\n1,200 tons of alfalfa in a isingle year.\nHow-does that strike you," man of old\nclay ridges away back east, man who\non your 160 manage to comb off a\nscant 50 tons of bay a year! besides\nyour little corn crops? How would\nyou like to buck up against a quarter\n^section with alfalfa, waving above the\nfenced, redolent of bloom and bees, to\nhear the mowers rattle and see tbe\nbuck rakes gathering up half-ton gobs\nof it and the horse lifting it aloft to\nto stack top? But it takes muscle,\nlots of it, and it its an all-year-round\njob to own on& of these alfalfa ranches,\nfor all summer you are haying and all\nwinter you are feeding the h$y to\nstock-\n5\ned that on alfalftt akme older aheep ^wlnter killlag, nor anything el«e that\nseamed to thrive better than lambs, so can upnxft\'U save a smaltaUed stump\nh^ began to feel them, thougb nqi jpull^t..\nins\nMM*.\nnot Buppd®^ to run tbe *y tqvenunent in Dickin- I proBriation te $19\nAlfalftt h^fe %a%t6. ri\'efther inocttfc\ntlon nor nursing.

T. Evening\nPost.)—The possibility of a new irri\xad\ngation policy looms before the country\nin a recently issued government re\xad\nport. That is,. Irrigation for the humid.\nparts of the east. Why, not? Irriga\xad\ntion is not only a necessity in the arid\nregions, but a decided aid to agricul\xad\nture everywhere, And why should\nUncle Sam draw the line at absolute\nnecessities? George H. Maxwell, the\nhead of an irrigation propaganda here,\non taking up residence in the suburbs\nof Bostog a few years ago, announced\nthat he wanted to equip a country\nplace with irrigation to show how\nmuch more could be done with all the\nwater a. field wants, and just when it\nneeds it, than by a mere haphazzard\ndependence upon nature*^ gifts. Per\xad\nhaps the time will come when in a\nwell-brdered farming community the\nrains-and the snows will be turned to\nthe uses of man, by reservoirs and\ntile drainage, just as fully as the cat\xad\ntle on tJbie MMdea have been bred ever\nfrom their natural state to a condition\nwhere they may better serve nqpn\'s\neconomic needs..\nAt all events, the itsliiief of \'tlie\ncultural department\'s bureau of irri\xad\ngation investigations has been study\xad\ning this subject ifi the valley of tue\nPo, which is not an arid region. The\nannual rainfall at Milan, the chief city\nof Lombardy, is more than 40 inches,\ngreater than that of Cincinnati or\nOmaha, The climate of Lombardy is\nnot different from that of the Missis\xad\nsippi valley, and the crops raised, with\nfew exceptions, ai9 the same. With\xad\nout Irrigation, the plain-- of Lombardy\nworuldi be fruitful but for their devel\xad\nopment a network of canals and drains\nhas been built. To secure thQgp-on\nstruiction of one of these canals, Milan\ngave a\nbonuiB\n»m-Q\nrepoMieanismini el\nof $400,000. This canal\ncost 16,000,000, or $37.50 for each acre\nof land that can be served by It. It\nsupplies water to 8,000 farmers,, who\npay firom one to two dollars per acre a\nyear. Some of this land .supports as\nmany as 800 people to the square mile,\nand has increased in value since the\nbuilding of the canal from 60 to 100\nper cent.\nUnder the Vettabbia Canal, which\nuses the sewage from ^lllan, meadows\nyield an annual crop worth $300 per\nacre. Some of the fields have been\nused as lfieadows, continuously\' for\n700 years. This great rise in land\nvalues and increase in productivity of\nlands, due to irrigation, In a region\nwith a rainfall equal to that of the\nsouthern half of the Mississippi valley\nand a climate no more favorable ^o\ncrop .production, leads to the conclu\xad\nsion, so the department expert say&,\nthat In irrigation this section has a\nmeans of at least doubling the present\nyield from its lands.\nIn Piedmont, which has an annual\nrainfall of more than 3 inches, or about\nthe same as eastern Nebraska and\nKansas, the Italian government has\nbuilt nearly a thousand miles of canals\nand\' expended about $20,000,000 for\nirrigation works. The annual Income\nfrom the government canals in this\nprovince is nearly $600,000. Pump\xad\ning plants- have been established to*\nraise thie water to lands above the\ncanals. One of these was put In at an\nexpense oi $47 per acre for the lands\nIrrigated, in addition to which the\nfanners are required to pay the annual\nmaintenance expense and $82 a year\nfor a cubic foot of water per second.\nIrrigated land supplied by this pump\xad\ning plant is worth three times as mpch\nas uniirigated land adjoining it\nThe Italian government disposes of\nwater directly to farmers at retail in\nsome sections, and In others sells it to\ncooperative associations. OneTot these\nhas 14,000 members, operates 9,600\nniiles of ditches, has 266 miles of tele\xad\nphone and telegraph lines,, supplies\nwater to 141,000 acres, aad does an\nannual business of $600,000. Eighty\nwater masters ^re employed by the\nassociation to distribute the water to\nits members. The farmers in this as\xad\nsociation pay from $1.60 to $9 per acre\nper year for water, according to the\ndistances of\'their land from the main\ncanal and the crops that they raise.\nThe Irrigation CongreM.\'\n.Wandan Pioneer: Tuesday\nnight a meeting of citizens was held\nat thie Inter Ocean to constder waye\nand! means to enteortteuin the irrigation\ncongress and the viWitors to the con\xad\ngress, who will be here next week.\nAfter considerable discussion, the fol\xad\nlowing gentlemen.were appointed a\ncommittee to arrange the affair, and\nto appoint such other committees a*\nthey may deem desirable Messrs.\n1®om, W.

Mr. Lewis entitles \'his paper\n"The Story of the Pires&ency." It i8\na remarkable review of American his\xad\ntory as reflected by the\nsuccessive\noc\xad\ncupants of the White House. Careful\nperspective and & freedom from politi\xad\ncal bias characterize the article, as do\nalso the author\'s "well-known virile\nstyle anid candor of staterabAit. Mr.\nLewis\'s ability to see clearly the true\nmeandng of things i« rivalled only by\nhis krnaick of starting, so "that every one\ncan understand him, the things that\nhe sees and the conclusion® he draws.\nA weaMhi of practical •Wisdom for\nthe intelligent American \'housewife is\ncontained\' in tihie October number of\nThe Housekeeper.

Hamilton writes -on The Last\nWork in tfoo Piower Garden, in pre\nparation for the. next season\'s flower\xad\ning. A large number of useful re\xad\ncipes for invalids are given by Mary\nB. James. Helps for Home" Dree®\nmakers contains, as usual, many valu\xad\nable suggestions. The annual baby\nparade at Asbury Parle, N. J., is por\xad\ntrayed in a double page of unique\nphotographs.\nThe picturesque "personality of\nThomas W. Lawson is well to the fore\nin the October Issue of" Eveiybody\'s\nMagazine. Not satisfied with the al\xad\nlowance of space given to his "Frenzi\xad\ned Finance" in thd body of the maga\xad\nzine, he has burst the bonds of editori\xad\nal convention and appropriated several\npages ill the advertising section, part\nof which he uses to reply to the scores\nof letters .and inquiries which his re\xad\nmarkable articles have brought hijp.\nThe October Installment of "Frenzied\nFinance" is devoted to John Edward\nO\'Sulliyan Addicks, through whom Mr.\nLawson first encountered Standard\nOil and H. H. Rogers. There is noth\xad\ning mild or conventional about his\ndescription of the Delaware statesman,\n[t is a \'femftfic audi ruthless indactarient of\nthe man and his methods, supported\nby specific details and incidents, and\nset forth with\' the same vivid art\nwhich characterized the study of\nH. Rogers in an earlier number. The\ndescription of Add^ck\'ff capture of\nBoston and its gas companies is one of\nthe most grimly humorous and enter\xad\ntaining pictures Mr. Lawson has yet\ngiven.\nl"\nMcClure\'a for October is timely in\nthe best, senae. It reads vigorously\nand intelligfktily sokneof the important\nlessons of the hour. In its serious\narticles McClure\'s does not deal with\nthe cursory and the superficial, but\nwith the vital, fundamental thing, and\ninterprets its real meaning and appli\xad\ncation. It is impressing itself tre\xad\nmendously, on the life and thought of\nthe day by its weighty and authorita\xad\ntive way of fdoTng things. In the\ndramatic story of Governor LaFollette\nand t3ie fierce political war which Is\nrending the State of Wisconsin, Lin\xad\ncoln Steffens has found material, not\nonly for a stirring story, bnt for the\npresentation of facts and principles of\nthe gravest significance to the re\xad\npublic. The fight here, as elsewhere,\nhe finds, is fbr self-government, repre\xad\nsentative of all people. He keenly\nanalyzes the opposing forces and de\xad\nfines the issues. In sharp contrast\nto this sordid history of "Enemies of\nthe Republic/\' and the distorting\nstories of civic and commercial dis\xad\ngrace wttb| McCJjure\'s has published\nrecently/ appears an inspiring sketdi\nof George William Cartifr-r\'Triend of\nthe Rwublic" the editor well styles\nhim—by Carl Schurz. Here is a most\nattractive picture of the finest type of\nthe American gentleman, the ideal citi\nzen, written by one who knew and\nappreciated his great worth. It af\xad\nfords a welcome glimpse of the other\nside of the shield. The climax of Ida\nif. Tarbell\'s monumental "History of\nthe Standard OH Compahy*^ is reached\ninn chapter of "Conclusions."
