Through\nthe Rich Coal Fields Will Be Com\npleted By September 30 191 1\nOne of the most important moves\nlo o9king towards the realization ofa\n< Greater Winchester that has bee U\nmade in years was that made lat\nr week in Louisville when contracts\nJ 4were let foe an SOmile extension\ny of the Lexington and Erstern Rail\nj oad from Jackson into the heart of\ni the rich coal and timber fields of\nEastern Kentucky\nV The completion of this extension\nbringing tJJ1 thitherto undeveloped\nsection of the State into direct com\nmunication with Winchester means\ninuch commercially and industrially\nw to this city and will undoubtedly add\nmaterially to its growth development\nfond prosperity\nInstead of W J Oliver of Knox\nyule Terin securing the entire con 1\ntract as reported in the early dis\npatches it was divided among five I\ncompeting firms each being given a\nsection of sixteen miles to complete\nThe contractors are Lane Brothers\nan Ohio firm which was awarded the\nfist sixteen miles above Jackson I\nMason Hanger Co Richmond Ky\nJones Brothers Richmond Va W J\nOliver Knoxville Tcnn and Lux\nConstruction Company Springfield I\nOhioActual\nActual work will begin on the ex\ntension Avibhin the next ten days or\ntwo weeks and the contract calls for\nits completcion not later than Sep\ntember 30 1911 So it will be seen\nthat within the next year trains will\nbe running over the extension and\nbringing into Winchester passenger\nand produce from this extensive and\nrich undeveloped territory\ni The extension which will follow\nthe North Fork of the Kentucky Riv\ner will extend through Brealhitt\ncross Perry end penetrate far into\nLctchcr passing beyond Whitesburg\nalmost to the foot of the Cumberland\nt Mountains The estimated cost of\nthe new line according to Civil ofI\ngincer William A Newman of Lex\niiigton who has been assisting the\nengineering corps at cork immediate\nly above Jackson is approximately I\n35000 per mile or about 3000\n000 for the entire eighty mile exten\nsion The proposed route crosse\nthe North Fork of the Kentucky 12\ntimes necessitating the construction\nof tht many bridges There will\nalso be six tunnels on the lines but\nr none of them of unusual length so\nMr Newman says\nDuring the last six months the L\nf E has built three miles of now\nroad above Jackson which will bo\ncompleted within the next month The\nproposed extension will start at the\nend of the three miles of new roaclj\nwhich is not included in the 80mik\ncontract just let and each contract\ning firm will push with vigor his sec\ntion thus hastening the completion\nof the entire extension\nMr Newman says the new exten\nsion will penetrate the richest coal\nfield in Kentucky and one of the rich\nest in the United States
