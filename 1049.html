Emma and James had long been, sweethearts. They knew their own, minds and diden\'t sec any sense in, postponing the inevitable, but., somehow or other. Emma\'s father, diden\'t take the same view of the, case, and stienuously objected to, the marriage, principally because, \' "he thuoght the lovers too young., Determined to outwitt he pater,, young Mr. Boyer came to Prescott,, secured a marriage licens. and re, . turning to Humboldt, \'engaged the\', services of Justice Francis. To, igether they journeyed to Cherry, Greek, arriving under cover of, darkness and repairing to the Boyer, home. At the nearby schoolhouse, tadancf was in prorgess, at which, lovers of the "light fantastic", Nvere present from all over that, part of the country, among them, Mr. Powell and his daughter., When all was in readiness for the, wedding a mutual friend of the, lovers entered the dance hall and, notified Miss Powel, who responded, to the summons of her future lord, bandmaster by slipping -away from, the dance to the side of her now, happy husband, leaving her father,, in complete ignorance of what was, transpiring "under hhis very noso,", to contine threading the mazes of, the dreamyw "dtz., The marriage ceremony quickly, follwoed. and later Justice Francis, viistedt he scene of tin dance,, wheie he met the still unsuspecting, father of the newly-made bride., "Glad to meet you." said Mr., Powell, when introduced to the, justice., "De-lighted," responded the, ju(1kc. adding. "I believe I officiat, ed at the marriage of your (laugh, ter a few moments ago.", "What the ," well, history, doesn\'t state cwtly what Mr Po, well did say, but that he was dumb, founded at the announcement goes, without saying. He quickly rccov, ered, however, and later extended, the desired parental blessing to the, happy pair, who were the recipients, of the hearty congratulations of all, present., The bride is the charming daugh, ter of Mr. and Mrs. W. D. Powell,, respected residents of Cherry Cieek,, and is n native daughter of Arizona., The jrrooin is the son of Mr. and, Mrs. J. II. Boyer, pioneer rs!donts, of Cherry Creek.

Her many, friends wish her a prosperous and, happy life., The Eagles have purchased the, ground south of the Odd Fellows\', cemetery which they will use for a, cemetery. They .are fencing the, ground and platting it ofl" this, week., Desert Life, Almost all life on the desert goes, armed. In the vegetable world of, th desert the cactus comes first, with its numberless species. They, are all armed with long, or short,, tough spines that can penetrate the, thickest boot. The solitary and, often grotesque "Joshua" or yucca,, the mesquit, the eatclaw and num, berless shrubs whose names have not, been written, all are armed in one, way or another. Some exade, poisonous sap, others nauseating, odors. The sagebrush is about the, only one that does not seem to have, any protection., In the animal kingdom most are, either armed with sharp teeth,, spines, odors or poisons to serve to, keep their enemies at a distance,, while the others depend upon their, fleetness or artful skulking and, hiding., The spined and repulsive Gila, monster, the horned toad, the side, winder with the two horns and, deadly fangs and its cousin, the, desert rattlesnake the tarantula,, scorpion \'and desert bee each of, whose sting is exceedingly painful, and sometimes fatal are among the, deserts denizens. Then there are, many vnrieties of lizards, large, and small and of many colors, who, protect themselves by their speed., The prowling coyote, bobcat,, mountain lion, jackrabbit, cotton, tail and an occasional deer ate, there., A hydrophobia skunk will be apt, to call and lunch from any bacon, finds that may be lying about not, disdaining a nip at Mr Ptospect, or\'s nose if the opportunity olFers., It is said and firmly believed by the, sons of the desert that the bite of, this little skunk pioduccs hydro, phobia. The Gila monster is sel, dom seen, and thj writer after hav, ing spent nearly a year on the, holders of Death Valley, has yet, to see one of them at large., Rattlesnakes ar also scarce, ex, cept in some favorable locality., The mountain sheep and the ibex, are gradually becoming tame, and, last summer they came to springs, where miners were camped as reg, ularly as domestic stock and with, little more timiditj. The mountain, quail follows the miner nntl his, burro. In the Avawatz mountains, they were unknown until this year,, but they are abundant there now., it is an unwritten law among the, miners on the dsert that no game, animals or birds shall be killed or, in any way disturbed unless one is, in actual want, and he must make, proof convincing of that fact if he, kills a quail or sheep., All life on the desert lives by its, power to resist thirst. All desert, plants are so constructed that they, aie able to conserve and store up, moisture against the time of, drouth. This necessity has wrought, peculiar forms of both animals and, plnnts. and in time it also leaves, its indelible mark upon men who, dwell amid its wastes., The leaves of all desert tiees aie, small and thick, so that thev ex, pose as little surface as possible for, evaporation in the dry air. The, great and ever present evidence of, the struggle for water is noticeable, everywhere men come together on, the desert. In , this struggle all, who come to the desert must en, gage instantly. Every wagon must, have its water barrels, every burro, his water bags, each man his can, teen.

But if their cravings aie, supplied, they scatter peacefully, over the pasture grounds and feed, at their leisure., Salt is o necessary to the easy, and profitable handling of sheep on, the range, that no flodunaster, would think\' of getting along, without it. If sheep do not receive, their usual supply it is only with, great difficulty that the can he held, in bonds or kept in camp at night., So far as sheep are concerned, no, regulation by law is really neces, sary, because the owners, for their, own convenience, will salt their, flocks. But cattle are not herded,, and the owners might neglect to, salt them, if the regulations weie, not strictly enforced., Stock on different ranges require, varying quantities of salt. Sheep, need less on dry range than on, green. An average quantity for, 1,000 head of sheep would be from, 1,000 to 1,500 pounds each year., For a like number of cattle,, from 5.000 to 10.000 pounds a year, is required. Horses need less than, cattle., Old hunters, in the days of the, pioneers, knew that deer and buffa, lo traveled long distances to lick, salt in saline springs. The Blue, Licks on Licking River, in Ken, tucky, and a similar mineral spr, ing on Elk River, in Wat Virginia, were famous for the hids of deer,, buffalo and elk which fiequented, them The adjacent ground was so, deeply tramped that the marks, weie to be seen many years after\', the places ceased to be visited by, the.se animals., Spend Large Sum, "A careful, conservative estimate, of the amount of money left in, Phoenix each yetar by the sheepmen, of the territory would place the, sum between $125,000 and $175,, 000," said Isaac Hat Lh. a prominent, Apache county sheepman, who has, some 15,000 head of sheep at the, new Quc\'ir\'s Creek camp, to a Gaz, ette reporter today., The sum of money mentioned by, Mr. Barth is a big one, but it is, rue beyond a doubt that the sheep, men of the territory who congre, gate in this city annually spend, conridcrably over $100,000. Part, of this money is spent for the shear, ing of their sheep, all of which, comes into this city, while the, balance of it is spent by the sheep, men themselves, most by of whom, keep their families here during, shearing season. A good majority, of the sheepmen are woatlhy and, all of them aie spenders of the, (irstwatcr. The minute they arrive, in town there is something doing,, and it keeps up until they leave for, their homes in diltcrent parts of, the territory., The Queen Creek camp, whteh is, located twenty miles east of Mesa,, is a new one. the owner of the, shearing plant being J. S. Bowen,, well known in this city. Mr. Barth, stated this morning that Mr., Bowen had informed him that he, would shear about 210,000 sheep, at the new camp this year., It was about twelve years ago, that the sheepmen of Arizona be, gan gathering their animals heie, inthe winter for shearing. At first, there were\'only a few hundred,, but year after year the number in, creased, until now it is estimated, tfiat there aie between 500,000 and, 700,000 sheep gathered each year in, this vall". This nrings in a, wonderful amount of money for the, Phoenix people and met chants, who, apparently have not awakened to, the full leali\'.ation of what the, gathering of sheepmen in Phoenix, each year means to the city and, county., Local people in speaking of the, advantages of this city are prone, to dwelt upon the amount, of money, brought here each year by tourists, but you very seldom hear of a, sheepman bieng mentioned, yet it, is safe to say tint the sheepmen, who come here each winter, a mere, handful in all, spend half again as, much money while here as all the, tourists put together.

This petition,, which is from the children of the, schools of Eureka, Humboldt county, California, is unlike any other, which has ever b;en sent to a gov, ernment department to ask for the, preservation of foiests. In the, petition the children say:, "We, the children of Eiueka, \' Schools, have been studying about, our redwood forests, and along, with the rest if the peopl i of our, country we feel that representative, groves of these trees should be pre, served for ourselves and coming, generations of children: and we, respectfully petition the United, btates Government to take borne, action toward establishing a Nat, ional Forest of redwoods.", " \' Government foresters who are ac, quainted with this section of Cal, ifornia say that the children give, good reasons for the establishment, of the National Park. It hns only, been a few years since the redwood, trees stood thick on the land around, the larger towns of Hubmoldt coutt, ty, but now all the readily access, ible timber has been removed, and, the people see tho timo when the, redwood groves will have disap, peared. There is little, if any, redwood, letf suitable for\' a National Park, that, has not fallen into private, hands. The acquisition of any su ch, areas therefore would have to be, brought about through purchase or, through private donation. If it is, found necee3sary to purchase the, land for the park Congressional, action will be required., It is not often that private do, nations of valuable timberlands are, made, but a notable example of, such generosity and public spirit, was recently shown by William, iKent, of Chicago, Ilinois. and, fKentfield. California, w ho present, ed a tract of 295 acres of magnifi, cent sequoias in Redwood Canyon, jnear San Francisco, to tho govern, ment. In Monterey and Trinity, (National Forests at Caliofrnia,, Ithero are a few small tracts of red, wood. The children do not specify any, (particular grove of trees which, ithey would like created a National, Park. It will therefore be neces, sary for the people of Humboldt, county to locate a suitable grove of, redwood to be made a National, \'Park, make arrangements fpr the, purchase of the tract and then re, quest Congress to take up the mat, ter. The Forest Service will be, able to do nothing more than to, supply all possible information, and assistance. The Chief Inspect, or at San Francisco v ill be request, ed to look into the matter and assist, those interested in the movement, in every way., Do Not Crowd the Season-, The first warm days of spring, bring with them a desire to get out, and enjoy the cxhilirating air and, sunshine. Children tiat have been, housed up all winter are brought, out and you wonder where they all, came from. The heavy winter, clothing is thrown aside and many, shed their flannels. Then a cold, wae comes and people say that grip, is epidemic. Colds at this season, are even more dangerous than in, mid-winter, as there is much more, danger of pneumonia. Take Cham, berlain\'s Cough Remedy, however,, and you will have nothing to fear., It always crues, and we have, never known a cold to result in, pneumonia when it wa3 ,used. It, is pleasant and safe to take. Child, ren like it.
