PRICE TEN CENTS, BALKANS WILL FIGHT UNTIL TIRED, Witnesses Tell How, MacDonald Shot Jones, Keist was examined rigidly as to, the epithet which he said MacDonald, used. After many questions relating, to it, Mr. Hellenthal asked:, "Now, Mr. Keist, are you real sure, that Mr. MacDonald said that?", "Yes. Mr. Hellenthal," answered, Mr. Keist, "and he\'ll tell you the same, thing if you ask him.", Following the adjournment of the, grand jury at Skagway, where Burns,, the cigar maker, had been active in, the investigations relating to the al, leged crime. Burns was accused by, two Slavonians of having threatened, to take MacDonald\'s life. Keist furn, ished the bond on which Burns was, released. The bond was produced in, court this morning to show that Keist, had a bad feeling towards MacDon, ald., Thompson was followed on the, stand by Gus Roene, the Douglas isl, and capitalist, whose German dialect, kept the audience amused for a half, hour. He said that he was standing in, the door of the machine shop when, he heard the shots fired, and going, over that way he met Mrs. Marks, 1, who told him that Mr. MacDonald, had shot "the marshal." On his way, he passed Mr. Kinzie, who was the, assistant superintendent, walking up, and down in front of his house, act, ing excitedly, and he thought that, Mrs. Marks had made a mistake, and, that it was not MacDonald but Kinzie, who had done the shooting. Mac, Donald. he said, was looking very cool, and undisturbed., Eye Witnesses Testify., Mrs. Anna Olson and Mrs. Hilda, Marks, who claimed to have seen all, or a part of the tragedy, were witness, es last night., Mrs. Olson testified that she stood, at a window in Assistant Superintend, ent R. A. Kinzie\'s house while Mr. Kin, zie and Mr. MacDonald were talking, at the gate. Mrs. Kinzie sent her up, stairs for her sewing, after which she, hurried back to her position at the, window. She testified that she got, back before the shots were fired and, that Jones was unarmed except for a, stick. He waved the sick during the, shooting, and that MacDonald and, Jones were not grappling., After the shooting, she said Mac, Donald walked toward the store. Some, body at the butcher shop, she said,, asked him if he had been shooting, dogs, and MacDonald laughed., Mrs. Marks testified that she had, just come from the store and was in, sight of MacDonald and Jones when, the first shot was fired. She stood, still. They were close enough to touch, each other but they did not touch. She, said that Jones held his hands up, wav, ing the stick. After the shooting, she, said. MacDonald looked up at her then, down at his revolver, and put the gun, in his pocket. Jones staggered back, to the hydrant and sat down slowly,, and then laid down. The crowd came, to see what the trouble was about and, Mrs. Marks says she ran home., Up to noon today, five witnesses, who were within a short distance of, the scene at the time of the homicide,, have given material testimony as to, | the killing of Jones. All of them were, subject to the most rigid cross exam, ination, hnt none of them were con, fused. and none of them deviated ma, terially from the story told in direct, examination., L. F. Heist was put on the stand at, the opening of court this morning. Ac, j cording to the testimony of Mr. Heist,, I he was probably the first person at, Treadwell to whom Jones spoke on, the morning of the tragedy, prior to, ; the killing. Keist found Jones on the, steps behind the butcher shop about, nine o\'clock that morning, and Jones, asked him if MacDonald was up., Keist replied that he did not know., An hour later, immediately before, the shooting, Keist was at the front, door of the butcher shop, and saw, Jones and MacDonald talking. Jones, was gesticulating with a little stick, which he had been whittling while he, waited for MacDonald. The two men, | were some little distance apart. Keist. :, in cross examination, was asked why, ! that stick had made so much impres, ; sion on him that he had remembered, kit all these year, and Keist answered j, that he thought Jones was "pretty j, sassy" to be talking to MacDonald and |, shaking a stick at the same time., Just before the shooting, his attention I, had been attracted by something in i, the shop, so that he was not looking!, when the shots were fired. Looking, again, after the firing of the shots, he |, saw Jones waiving his hai.ds in the, air. Except for the stick, which he, still held, his hands were empty., | Jones then staggeder away toward, the hydrant, where he first sat, and, then lay down., As MacDonlad walked by, Keist, says he accosted him with:, "What the hell\'s going on?", In reply, Keist testified that Mac, Donald murmured : "The s ? of, and passed on., Mr. Keist was followed on the, stand by C. P. Thompson, who was al, so employed in the butcher shop at, that time. He also testified to the re, mark which Mr. Keist said that Mr., MacDonald had made about Jones af, ter the killing. Mr. Thompson also, testified that Keist had brought the, stick Jones had had into the butcher, shop, where it was kept until it was, ! sent for. Thompson was asked If he, knew who had sent for it, but the, defense objected, and he was not al, lowed to answer., A slight discrepancy occurred be, tween the testimony of Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Keist as to what Keist was, doing at the time the first shot was, fired. Thompson said his impression, was that Keist was cutting meat at, the block a few feet away, but he was, not sure., The prosecution introduced the, story of the killing of N. C. Jones by, Joseph MacDonald yesterday after, noon and today in the United States, district court where Judge F. M. Brown, and twelve jurors are trying Mac, Donald for his life. The story as, told by the government witnesses is, that outlined by District Attorney, John Rustgard in his opening* state, ment to the jury., IMPORTANT PARTY, ON THE MARIPOSA, R. W. Baxter, vice-president and, gtneral manager of the Alaska Steam, ship Company; W. R. Rust, president, of the Tacoma smelter company;, Lewis A. Liversaler, mining engin, eer; Hugh C. Wallace, a capitalist of, Tacoma and Washington, D. C., and, George Duncan, private secretary to, Mr. Rust, form a very interesting par, ty that came North on the Mariposa, i, Last evening the entire party called, on Gov. J. F. A. Strong at the Gov, ernor\'s House., Mr. Baxter said that his journey at, this time had no special significance., He was making one of his periodical, voyages to the Northern wonderland., Mr. Baxter expressed himself as be, ing highly pleased over the outlook for, Alaska, and the activity around Ju, neau especially. Mr. Br.xter and Mr., Liversaler continued on to the West, ward., Mr. Rust and his secretary and Mr., Wallace debarked at Juneau and took, the Georgia last night for Chichagoff, for the purpose of looking over the, mines and property in which they are, interested. Later on they will con, tinue to the Westward looking the, country over., Mr. Liversaler is in the employ of, the smelting company with headquar, ters at Tacoma. It is expected that, he will spend several months in the, Copper river section and in the Prince, William Sound country looking over, copper properties in the interests of, his people., o ? o ? o, SUCCESSFUL BIG GAME, HUNTERS RETURN, James Morris and Mrs. Morris re, turned with the cruising launch San, ta Rita, which they have had under, charter during the several weeks hunt, ing and fishing on Admiralty island, and down about Snettisham. They, had splendid success and a jolly good, time while out. The trophies taken, include five big bear and six mountain, goat. All of which are in prime con, dition. Many more could have been, taken, but they had all they cared, for. Trolling for king salmon furnish, ed pleasurable sport during a part of, their stay while out., Mrs. Morris killed half of the ani, mals taken and amazed the guides by, shooting an eagle at 300 yards while, in a moving launch. She also sur, prised them by picking a goat at 500, yards while standing on a narrow, ledge and in a perilous position. Both, shots were remarkable exhibitions of, 1 cleverness with the rifle., O ? 0 ? o, SPECIAL SALE, ONE-THIRD OFF on all Hart, SchafTner & Marx clothing.

Father E. H. Brown performed, the rites of the Church. The funeral, was attended by many of his fellow, workers and others., James Harrington was a native of, Ireland between 25 and 30 years of, age and came to America about nine, years ago. He came North and had, been working at the Sheep creek tun, nel about one month. Con Sullivan,, one of his fellow workers, was well, acquainted with him, and speaks of, him in the highest terms. He was a, good miner and a good man. Deceased, was single and has a mother and fath, er living in Ireland., A battle is being waged to save, the sight of Stanley Vuryer, one of, the victims of the accident. The left, eye is lost, but there is a chance to, save the right one., Victor Vanstrom, with two broken, legs, and James Miclen, with a brok, en arm, will have slow recoveries,, but they are getting along all right., All of the others are making excel, lent progress toward recovery. One of, them left the hospital last night and, returned to Sheep creek. Another was, well enough to walk down to the post, office this morning. Another, who, could not hear a sound when brought, to the hospital yesterday, has had his, hearing restored to its normal state, today. It will be only a matter of a, few days until the remaining seven, w ill all be out of the hospital., o ? o ? o, ALASKA TIMBER, POR PAPER PULP, The United States Forest Service ;, has issued the following bulletin:, WASHINGTON, July 3? Bids have, just been received by the Forest Ser, vice for 300 million feet of timber, which has been advertised for sale on, the Tongass National Forest in Alas, ka, and an additionaj 300 million feet, from the same forest has been applied, for. A large part of this timber is Sit- j, ka spruce, which will be made into, paper pulp not only for the Pacific, Coast and the Orient, but for the gen- ;, eral pulp market., The latest estimates of the Forest, Service available show that there is a, stand of approximately 70 billion feet, on the Tongass national forest and ap, proximately 28 billion feet on the Chu- !, gach national forest in Alaska. Re- !, cent investigations have shown this, amount to be very much larger than, was supposed. The Alaskan forests. {, according to bureau experts, contain ;, approximately one-sixth of the total ;, stand of timber on the national for, ests. The annual cut on the Tongass, forest has increased gradually from 1, zero at its creation in 1902 until it, amounted to approximately 43 million, feet in the year 1912. This entire j, amount has been cut for local uses, j, largely for boxes to contain canned, salmon. The latest large sale is re, markable in that it indicates a begin, ning of the utilization of Alaska tim- j, ber in the general markets., On the area on the Stikine river,, for which bids have been received, the, species to be cut include Sitka spruce,, hemlock, red cedar, cottonwood, and, yellow cedar, and the minimum Btump, age rates range from $2.50 to $1.00 a, thousand feet, according to species,, the yellow cedar bringing the highest, price. Another pulp company has, made application for the other area,, at the head of Thorn Arm, which con, tains the same species to be sold at, similar prices. This company has had, men examining timberlands in Alaska, during a long period and over large, areas, and has come to the conclusion, that the Tongass timber offers the, best opportunity it has seen., The three great advantages which, the paper manufacturers say they are, finding in Alaska are abundant sup, plies of timber, cheap hydro-electric, power, and tide-water transportation ?, all of these in one and the same lo, cality. Both areas adjoin deep water,, and it is probable that the plants will, be so located that ocean freighters can, be loaded right at the mills., A cutting period of twenty years, will be allowed, with two years addi, tional for construction work. The, prices may be adjusted at five-year, intervals to take care of possible ad, vances in lumber values., o ? o ? o, WHEN YOU want to eat well, go, to the Commercial Cafe Dining Room,, Lunch Counter, Private Boxes.

Stevenson, Dies at Tacoma, TACOMA, July 15. ? George H. Stev, enson, for many years one of the, leading politicians of the State of, Washington, was found dead in this, city yesterday under circumstances, that would indicate that he had com, mitted suicide., For a quarter of a century George, Stevenson had charge of the railroad, lobby at Olympia. He was elected to, i:he legislature, when a young man,, from Skamania County, the smallest, in the State, as a Democrat. His ac, curate judgment, tact in getting along, with men, ability to remember faces, and names, conservative tendencies,, industry, knowledge of when to talk, and to whom, and, according to his, i standards, honesty put him to the fore, front in the legislature, and early in, his legislative career he became the, house manager for the railroads and, ! allied interests. Later, he quit the, i legislature, and took personal charge, of the legislative end of the Northern, i Pacific\'s work, receiving a handsome, ; salary and dispensing their political, money. He was present at all political, j conventions. Republican and Demo, I cratic, although he now afiliated with, i the Republicans, and, when the legis, lature convened, opened headquarters, at Olympia where he made "Temple, Flats" ? the name of the apartment, house wherg he usually had his head, quartes ? famous in the Northwest., His identification with the railroads, in their fights against legislation de, manded by the farmers of Eastern, Washington and other shippers final, ly caused him to become so unpopu, lar that the Northern Pacific dls, i pensed with his services ten years ago,, and for a time he was given a place, with the Oregon Railway & Navigation, Company. For the last time he com, manded the railroad fight at the leg, islative session of 1903, when the com, | bination defeated the Tolman railroad j, commission bill and elected Levi Ank- 1, eny Senator. During that session his \', headquarters were at the Oarleton ho- :, tel, and he never left them during the ;, whole winter except on the night of ,, Ankeny\'s election., Lived in North., In 1897 and the years following, dur, ing the free-silver ascendency in, Washington State, Stevenson was in, business in Dawson, yet he never, mVjsed a Washington legislative ses, sion on that account., The winter of 1903 marked the end, of the old order of things at Olympia., The railroads gave up the fight. At, the next session the railroad commis- 1, sion was created, and the railroads, conceded the right of the State !, to regulate all public service corpor, ations. George Stevenson became pro, prietor of the Diller hotel at Seattle,, and for several years his place was, the rendezvous of the old politicians, of the State when they came to Seat, tle. A few years ago he sold the hotel,, and entered business in Tacoma. He, had, probably, as many personal, friends as any man that was ever ac, tive in Washington politics., T. J. McCAUL BUYS, THE LYONS BUILDING j, T. J. McCaul has bought the Post, office building from Judge Thomas R., Lyons which added to the ground oc, cupied by the McCaul building makes, a business location 50 xl20 feet, front, ing fifty feet on Front street and ex- ,, tending 120 feet toward the water, front. It js Mr. McCaul\'s intention to \', remodel both the Lyons and McCaul |, buildings., The McCaul building will have a, second story added to it and be con, nected with the remodeled Lyons:, building making the upper floor suit, able for lodgings or offices., o ? o ? o, JOHN SETER WAS, JUNEAU PIONEER, John Seter, the pioneer gardener, of Juneau who died Monday and was !, buried yesterday, was one of the real, old time prospectors of the country., He came to America from England, and followed prospecting since 1876., Deceased was 68 years of age at the, ! time of his death. Eighteen years ago, he settled on the land which has been, his home ever since. It lies near the, city cemetery and was held under lode, and placer locations. Some of the, land has been the cause of litigation, with the City of Juneau. For many, ! years he cultivated a part of the land, as a vegetable garden., The funeral was held from the par, lors of the C. W. Young company un- 1, der the direction of F. G. Wettrick, and Lloyd C. Hill, who had been his, close friends for years. The Rev., George E. Renison made the funeral, address., Lloyd C. Hill was associated with I, deceased as partner in the mineral !, locations and will make application, to be appointed administerator of the, ! estate., u ? u ? u, M ISSI ON A I R I ES GOING, TO POINT BARROW, Deaconess B.

They will leave the ship at Skagway,, and go down the Yukon river, taking, passage from Nome for their destina, tion at Alaska\'s farthest North., o ? o ? o, CABLE SITUATION, IS NOT CHANGED, There has been no change in the ca, ble situation. At the Juneau office, I every thing is set, and men are watch, ing the tape constantly to catch the, I first vibration that will notify them of, the presence of the Rapid Transit and, I the" cable crew that is on her at the, other end of the wire, but It comes, j not., Sergeant Floyd knows nothing of, 1 what is causing the delay in the re, pair work, and only conjecture is left, as a basis upon which to make cacu, | lations., RAILROAD TRAINMEN, OFFICER IS DEAD |, CEDAR RAPIDS, la., July 15?

McGlllicuddy, th?*, present Democratic Representative, from his old Second Congressional, district., Mulhall says that the manufacturers, had spent great forMhiee to keep In, diana out of the hands of the Demo, crats.

It is probable, the experts ad, mit, that next January, if not sooner,, several torpedo boats will be sent, through by the United States govern, ment. Indeed it is said that the cut, ting is deep enough now to allow, small vessel to go through, but there, apparently is no assurance of perma, nency., o ? o ? o, FARM MORTGAGES MAY, BE BASIS OF CURRENCY, WASHINGTON, July 15.?

F. A. STRONG, JOHN W. TROY, Editor., Telephone No. 3-7-4, Entered as second-class matter November 7, 1912 at the postoftice at Ju, ueau, Alaska, uuder the Act of March 3, 1S79., SUBSCRIPTION RATES:, $10.00, 6.00, 1.00, LOOKING FOR MINES, THE different mining sections of the Territory are full of min, ing men, it is said, who are looking for investments in gold, and copper mines. It is a hopeful sign and is indicative, of the revival of interest on a broad scale. Alaska has been, under a cloud for some time, due in part to crass governmental, policies, and the bottling up of the country in the cause of so, called conservation. Some sections of the Territory are going, through the process of evolution; placer mining is being replaced, by quartz mining and necessarily the development is somewhat, slow. But for all that substantial progress is being made and, there is a spirit of hopefulness abroad in the land., But while this is undoubtedly true it does not lessen the, fact that railroad transportation is a prime necessity to the de, velopment, growth and permanent prosperity of Alaska. The, opening of the interior regions by railroads would bring certain, prosperity to a rich and fertile portion o? Alaska and would in, cidentally benefit the entire Territory. And railroads will be, constructed. The development of Alaska may be delayed for, a brief season but it cannot be stayed indefinitely., Secretary of State Bryan is perfecting peace plans, accord, ing to the press dispatches. He should try them on Mexico and, see if they will "take." Then the Balkan States offer an excel, lent field should Mexico be impossible for the peace serum to get, in its work*, year, by mail . ., Six months, by mail ., Per month, delivered, TROUBLED AND TROUBLESOME MEXICO, MEXICO will fool around and abuse American citizens resi, dent in that country until she arouses the ire of this coun, try and the subsequent proceedings will be mightily inter, esting for Mexico. Mexico needs what she has not at >her com, mand ? a stable government. Nor does it seem possible, if we, are to judge by recent history, that she is capable of maintain, ing anything but a semblance of sane government. Porfirio Diaz, ruled the Mexicans with a rod of iron for thirty years. His rule, was a record of bloody deeds, but his government was called, "stable." The country made substantial progress, although Diaz, was responsible for the death of 30,000 of his fellow countrymen, ? insurrectos at reguar or irregular periods, as the fancy struck, them or opportunity afforded. But foreigners ? the Gringoes ?, were protected and Mexico took rank among cilivized nations., The rule of Diaz, however, became intolerable and revolu, tionists under Francisco Madero compelled him to flee the coun, try of which he had been the overlord for so many years. The, fate of Madero was tragic. A victim of his enemies he fell by, the hands of assassins, and the present alleged government under, General Huerta has been trying to bring order out of the chaos, of recent years. But revolution is still rife and Mexico\'s govern, ment today is as unstable as water. Another turn in the revolu, tionary wheel may be expected with more murder to \'accentuate, the country\'s deplorable condition. But why should the United, States intervene? We have no business in Mexico. Let that, unhappy country and its more than mercurial people work out, their own destiny even if it entails annihilation. The country, is all right, but the race of people that inhabit it could be easily, improved., An actor recently married his 13th wife, and she thinks it, was an unlucky marriage. He probably went through the 13th, wedding ceremony because he could not go further along the, matrimonial road without passing that milestone, and is now, trying to get past it at the earliest possible date that he may jour, ney along his way in peace and happiness ? at least until he gets, up against 23., THE TARIFF LAW IN THE SENATE, THE tariff fight is on in the Senate, and the Republican assault, has been begun. The high-protected interests have rallied, their forces and they will put up a strong fight, for they, have been so long and so firmly intrenched that they will seize, every vantage point in order to secure concessibns., The tariff bill will be passed substantially as it was intro, duced in the Senate. The people_of the country demand a down, ward revision of the tariff, and they are going to get it. The, day of altitudinous protection in America has passed. The era, of special privilege is doomed and a broader policy is about to, take its place. And the nation will be the gainer. The mourn, ful cries of those who have been specialy favored through the, operation of unjust and unequal tariff laws will not avail them, at this time, and even while they protest they are getting ready, to meet the changed conditions which tariff revision downward, will inevitably bring. Our manufacturers have a tremendously, large home market to supply, and under the new tariff they will, continue to control it to a large extent, but the excessive profits, of the past will be denied them. The people, howev?l\' will be, the gainers., Besides the lowering of the tariff, schedules will open up new, markets for our manufactured products, and the volume of bus, iness, now gratifyingly large, will be substantially increased., There lives or sleeps some place a village Mark Twain that is, being deprived of the fame that is his just desert.

The, tight money market, the pending tar, iff revision and the prospects of a cur, rency revision which is looked upon, with considerable doubt by many fi, nanciers collectively, have not served, to interrupt the general currents of, trade to anything like the extent an, ticipated as certain to follow the strug, gle in Congress over the tariff., According to the commercial re, ports, the hot weather in the East J, and the approach of the midsummer, holidays stimulated largely the retail, trade in seasonable goods, although it, made for quiet in wholesale and indus, trial lines. The extreme heat made, the three-day suspension of operations, of industrial plants a welcome release I, to those employed therein., Bank clearings for the whole country j, show better than for June of last year, i, while the commercial agencies report, fewer failures during the month than, for any other month for a period of, two years back. The new features of, the week were distinctly favorable. ?, Seattle Post-Intelligencer., lTR(wES AlITO ROAD, SKAGWAY TO DAWSON, Canada will have the longest and, lonliest motor road in the world ac- j, cording to the recent dicesion of the j, government to build a motor road in, to Dawson City. Fifty thousand dol, lars has been voted for the puposes of, this road, and a couple of other such, votes will be necessary to finish it., At the present time Dawson is only, reached by stage in winter, when there j, is a deep coating of snow on the, ground. It is the intention of the gov, ernment to build a road for motors, 100 miles in length, from Whitehorse. :, at the head of the Yukon\'s two thous- ,, and miles of navigation, right into, Dawson City. Dr. Alfred Thompson,, M.P. for Yukon, who obtained this, grant, will take surveyors with him, into the territory to start the work on, his return to his constituency., At the present time the motor has, I penetrated into the center of Africa,, { and almost everywhere else. Tourists, go thousands of miles in order to trav, el over some road, hitherto unknown, to the power car. And thus, when the, motor road is finished into Dawson, it, will not only open that Canadian city, to the tourist traffic of the world, but, attract tourists from many lands. ?, Ottawa Free press., The foregoing from the Ottawa pa, per only serves to emphasize the ar, gument advanced by this paper last, week in favor of an automobile road,, not only from Whitehorse to Dawson,, but from Skagway to Dawson via, Whitehorse. In the event of the con, struction of the latter, ten machines, will tour Yukon to every one that will, be seen here if they are required to be, shipped from the coast to this place., A road suitable for autos from White, horse to Dawson will be a good thing, \' but one from Skagway to Dawson, | would be ten times better. ?

In, the Senate a careful poll has shown, 5S Senators favorable to the passage, of the Jones-Chamberlain bill for the, issuance of $40,000,000 bonds for the, construction of railroads of such mile, age, over such routes and from such, port as the President shall designate., In the House the sentiment for the 1, legislation is no less favorable, there, being a probability of a unanimous, report from the House committee on, territories on a similar bill introduced, by Delegate James Wickersham oi i, Alaska., "At a meeting of this committee 1, there were 10 members present and j, every one expressed his approval of h, government railroads in Alaska. S ec- j, retary Lanes\' recent attitude toward ?, the bill is pleasing to the friends of !, Alaska. When the subject was first, brought to his attention I^ane was, busy reorganizing his department and ^, some of the advocates of this legisla- t, tion thought they saw some lukewarm, ness on his part., Credit Due Heifner., "Now that he has things running, smoothly in the interior department,, the secretary never loses an opportu, nity to let members of Congress know, that he favors government roads in, Alaska and that he believes the action, should come at this session.
