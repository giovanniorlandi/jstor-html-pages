Stock, naturally,\nwas very scarce, but a few droves\nchanged hands Saturday on the roads\nleading to Stanford, several local\nfeeders going out after herds that\nthey got word of coming to town for\nquick sale, without going to the\nstockyards.\nMule owners brought in a large\nnumber of the hybrids and several\nbuyers were here looking for them,\nbut very, very few sales were made.\nFrank Tolliver, of Lebanon,-Tenn.,\nsaid that the prices asked were alto\ngether too high for him, and others\nreported the same thing. Horses\nwere also very slow in moving. Lusk\nand Strader, of Hustonville, took\ndown a nice young stallion at $97.50\nand I. C. Brown\'s big black Perche\nron did not sell.\nAlthough the day was fair, a cold\nwind kept the crowd on the sunny\nside of Main street, and the candi\ndates had a field day. Politics has\nbegun to warm up in the local dis\ntrict races. Both Judge Charles A.\nHardin, of Mercer, and Hon. C. C.\nFox, of Danville, candidates for the\ndemocratic nomination for circuit\njudge, were on hand, and put in a\nmighty busy day, as did the three\ncandidates for Commonwealth\'s At\ntorney, Judge J. S. Owsley, of Stan\nford, E. V. Puryear, of Danville, and\nR. W. Keenon, of Harrodsburg. The\ncircuit clerk\'s race between J. D.\n"VVearen and M. C. Newland began to\nwarm up. The former announced\nlast week and the latter was telling\nhis friends that he would announce\ntoday.\nConsiderable interest and specula\ntion has been aroused in the Circuit\nJudge\'s race, over the matter of the\nappointment of Master Commis\nsioners by the two candidates, in the\nfield. So .far as known Mr. Fox has\nnot yet made public the name of the\ndemocrat whom he will appoint Mas\nter Commissioner in Lincoln in the\nevent he is nominated and elected.\nNor has Judge Hardin, it is under\nstood. Friends of present Commis\nsioner E. D. Pennington are "pulling"\nhard to have Judge Hardin retain\nhim in the place, but it is said that\nseveral other prominent democratic\nworkers would like to have the place,\nand that they or their friends have\nso informed Judge Hardin. An in\nteresting scramble for this nice lit\ntle plum promises to develop, as the\njudge\'s race waxes warm.\n-.J.udge Hardin\'s Master Commis\nsioner in "Boyle county, popular John\nB. Stout, was over with him Monday,\nand it is understood, Is an applicant\nfor reappointment if his chief wins.\nIt is reported that Mr. Fox will ap\npoint Ad T. Lanier as his Commis\nsioner in Boyle, if he wins. In Mer\ncer, Judge Hardin\'s Commissioner is\nhis brother, E. M. Hardin, who was\nhere with the Judge Monday doing\nsome effective work for his brother.\nIt is reported that Fox\'s Commis\nsioner in Mercer will be Squire Black,\na very influential democrat of Judge\nHardin\'s home county. Just what\nthe situation is in Garrard, is hard\nto ascertain. It is reported that a\nclose friend of James I. Hamilton,\nis to be named Commissioner by Mi.\nFox in the event he wins, and friends\nof popular "Boge" Brown, who is\nJudge Hardin\'s present Commission\ner, expect that he will be reappoin\nted in the event of Judge Hardin\'s\nsuccess.\nInterest in the state races was\nmanifested on the streets here Mon\nday though nothing like as keen as\nin the district races. The entrance\ninto the governor\'s race of Harry V.\nMcChesney on a state-wide prohibi\ntion platform seemed to be hailed\nwith delight by trie enthusiastic\ntemperance people of the county.\nMany shrewd political observers ex\npressed the opinion that the govern\nor\'s race will narrow down between\nMcChesney, Stanley and Bosworth.\nWesley Embry was over from Frank\nfort putting up pictures of Barksdale\nHamlett, present Superintendent of\nPublic Instruction, in whose office\nybung Embry has a position. As\nthis is the old home county of Col.\nW. P. Walton, few believe that it will\ngo against him in this, the only\nthing he has ever asnecr of the dem\nocratic party after a lifetime of ser\nvice. Little Done In County Court.\nYesterday was a quiet one in the\ncounty court. A few orders of mi\nnor importance y-\'erts made, some set\ntlements attended to and one will\nprobated. The latter was that oftJ.\nL. Jones, who made his wife, Mrs.\nSusan Jones, his executrix, and left\nhis property, including a small farm\non Logan\'s creek, tofher during her\nnatural life. At hersfleath the prop\nerty is to be sold anf the money di\nvided among his children, of which\nthere are several. -sThe court named\nJ. C. and W. H. Eepples and W. P.\nLogan as the appraisers of the es\ntate. W. R. McGarley qualified as\nguardian of his -year-old daughter,\nv Fannie McCarley.\nBradfordsville House Burns\nThe residence of Mrs. Matilda\nThornton at!Sradfordsville was des\ntroyed by fire, which is thought to\nhave originated from a defective flue.\n"The greater part of the household ef\nfects were removed. The loss is esti\nmated at $2,000 and is partly covered\nby insurance.\nTo The Houavnrife\nMadam, if your husband is like\nmost men he expects you to look af;v\nter the health of yourself and chil\ndren.

D. EARLY.\nWar Causes Hemp to Jump\nOn account of the war in theEu\nropean countries hemp went at $9 per\nhundred pounds this season, and but\n87,000 were raised and sold in Clark\ncounty, says a dispatch from Win\nchester. This amount but a few years\nago represented the crop of one far\nmer. On account of the difficulty se\nfcuring competent hands to break it,\nfarmers iave ceased to worry over\nthis crop as it takes the full year to\npreparelt for the market from the\ntime the seed is sown. This year buy\ners have offered 8 for the 1915\ncrop, and as a result there will be\nseveral hundred more acres grown\nthe present year. With good seson\ngrowers claim that ir ?5 can be secur\ned the crop can be grown profitably\nand many of them will give up tobac\nco and plant more hemp. Hemp is\nsold all over the world. A hemp\nbreaking machine is the only piece of\nfarm machinery that has never been\nperfected by the inventor, and this is\none of the chief reasons for the dis\ncontinuance of the crop in the Blue\nGrass. Hemp aids the soil while to\nbacco sets it back two years.

McChesney, of Frankfort,\nhas announced that he would be a\ncandidate for the Democratic nomina\ntion for Governor. No other entries\nare expected and the race probably\nwill be run by no mre than are now\nannounced: Lieutenant Governor E.\nJ. McDermott, of Louisville; State\nAuditor H. M. Bosworth, of Lexing\nton, former Congressman A. O. Stan\nley, of Henderson, J. W. Newman, the\npresent Commissioner of Agriculture,\nand H. H. Cherry, of Bowlong Gre\'en.\nMr. McChesney\'s declaration leaves\nno room for conjecture as to where he\nstands upon the State-wide proposi\ntion and says he will, if elected, rec\nommend to the General Assembly\nsubmission to a vote of the people an\namendment to the constitution pro-\n,.,..- u ! i rv,.,,,,,.,, nf\ntions.\nMr. McChesney submits his per\nsonal candidacy, aside from the cause\nhe espouses, on his record as State\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction\nand as Secreary of State, and prom\nises abridgement of public expendi\ntures where it can be economically\ndone, and the further advancement\nof the present progress in educational\nand agricultural development within\nthe Commonwealth.\nForty-six year ola, virile, enthusi\nastic and of a ready wit, Mr. Mc\nChesney has made himself one of\nthe best known Democrats in Ken\ntucky, through his activity in the in\nterests of the party in every cam\npaign since boyhood. He entered pub\nlic life at the age of 25, when he was\nelected County Superintendent of\nLivingston. He was re-elected to that\noffice. Previous to that he had taught\nin Caldwell, his native county; Crit\ntenden, where he was reared; Web\nster and Livingston.\nFrom County Superintendent of\nLivingston he was promoted to the\noffice of State Superintendent in\n1899, running on the Goebel ticket.\nFour- years later he was elected \'Sec\nretary of State on the ticket with J.\nC. W, Beckham.\nTheir friendship has been continu\nous and close since that time. Mr.\nMcChesney was chairman of the\nspeakers\' bureau of State headquar\nters in 1911 and, excepting Governor\nMcCreary himself, made more\nspeeches in fhe campaign than any\nother Democrat. He stumped the\nState with Mr. Beckham when the\nlatter was elected United States Sen\nator. Probably no public man in the\nState is in more demand as a\nspeaker on all sorts of occasions than\nMr. McChesney, and his interests in\naffairs touching community life, as\nwell as the welfare of the State, are\nwell known in Frankfort, where he\nhas resided and has been practicing\nlaw since leaving State office.

She immmediately\ngave bail and was released. The only\neyewitness to the killing was their\nson and his evidence before the Coro\nner\'s jury was the basis of the verdict\nof murder. The son testified that a\nquarrel between his mother and fa\nther resulted in her slapping his face\nand that each made for a loaded shot\ngun.

Marshal Winfrey, had their\nhearing before U. S. Commissioner\nW. S. Lawwill at Danville late last\nweek and early this week. All of them\nso far heard have been held over to\nawait the action of the Federal\ngrand jury at Covington, where they\nwill be tried. The examination of\nbut one prisoner is held each day so\nthat the cases are being dragged out\nto an unusual length.\nOf the prisoners so far examined\nArthur Smith, was held in the high\nest bond, his bail being fixed by the\nCommissioner at $1,500. It is un\nderstood that the Commissioner\nfixed his bond at such a figure be\ncause of the threats which Smith is\nalleged to have mace -.o kill the man\nwho "turned him up." Tom Helm\nwas held under $1,000 bond and\nHardin Hill under $750. Jeff Bryant\nand Will Lee who were arrested some\ntime before on the same charge, con\nfessed guilty and were fined $100\neach and given a jail sentence.\nLincoln Jury to Try Pulaski Case.\nIn obedience to an order of the\nPulaski county circuit court, Sheriff\nJones of that county, came to Stan\nford late Monday to summon a spe\ncial venire of 60 jurymen to try a\nmurder case at Somerset this week.\nThe visiting officer was rendered ev\nery assistance by Sheriff J.

There was\n"tall hustling for cover" in town\nwhen the mission of the two officers\nwas learned, and several well known\ncitizens who happened to be in town\nlast night, spent several hours hiding\nin cellars and other places of con\ncealment to escape the eyes of the\nofficers. Nothing is known here of\nthe character of the case to be tried,\nexcept that it is styled the Common\nwealth against Sullivan.

A Visitor.\nGarnett and Tom Smith "Mentioned"\nThe political column of the Cincin\nnati Enquirer Sunday had the follow\ning of interest in the eighth district:\nAttorney-General James Garnett\nthis week said he is considering a pro\nposal to engage in the practice of law\nat a point other than his home town,\nColumbia, at the expiration of his\nterm next December. If he accepts\nit he will quit politics entirely, but if\nhe returns to Columbia, he may make\nup his mind to harken to the call of\nhis friends and announce for the\nDemocratic nomination for Congress\nin the Eighth District in opposition to\nRepresentative Harvey Helm, said to\nbe the best hand-shaker who ever\ncame down any pike in the Eighth.\nThe fellows who are boosting Garnett\nhowever, say that Helm never had a\nman just like the Attorney-General\nto try conclusions with him and that\nhe would find Garnett a mighty ad\nversary. State Bank Commissioner\nTom Smith, of Richmond, may enter\nthe race for Congress, but it would\nnot appear to be good politics for him\nto enter for the Democratic nomina\ntion if Garnett decides to make the\nrace.\nPrize Herd Destroyed.\nA herd of prize cattle, valued at\n$40,000, which had been found to be\nhopelessly infected with the foot and\nmouth disease, was shot on the farm\nof Ephriam T.
