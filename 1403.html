Oct. 20. is\nrated by many experts as the best in\nthe country, despite the fact that it\nwas beaten out in the National\nleague race by the Chicago Cubs.\nThe claim of superiority is based up\non some solid facts as the records\nprove that for three and a half\nmonths Pittsburg Has won a larger\npercentage of games than any other\nteam. National league enthusiasts\nbelieve that in a season\'s race it\nwould run away from the best in the\nAmerican league. The Pirates fin\nished well, ahead of the Philadelphia\nNationals, who, in turn, simply out\nclassed the Philadelphia Americans\nat the beginning of the season.\nThe payroll oft the Pittsburg team\nis the highest in the country .and has\nbeen so for several years and as a\nresult of the generous treatment\nthey have received from President\nBarney Dreyfuss, nipst ot the Vet\nerans of the team are well46-3d.\nOf the players who owe th?if start\nentirely to baseball Fred Clarke and\nHans Wagner are the best fixed in\nthe country. Both listened to the\nadvice given them by the \' Pittsburg\nmagnate and when their baseball\ndays are over they will have exten-1\nsive personal interests to keep them\nbusy. Clarke has a ? big* r&rar ire\nKansas.where he vent last week.\nWagner has invested his mdnfcjP in\nreal estate at his home town\',\' Car\nnegfe^Pa.

Knex.\nInefficiency of Labor.\nThe Iron Age bewails the decline\nin the efficiency of labor, which it\nsays Is the gravest evil from which\nthis country is now suffering, graver\nby far than the exaggerated dangers\nfrom monopolies or from freight re\nbates. This evil finds expression,\nsays that publication, in slouchy\nwork on the part of those who know\nhow to do better,, and poor work on\nthe part of those who have never\nbeen taught or ar? incapable ot\nlearning. To the more serious de\nfect of lower quality is added the\ntroublesome feature of lessened\nquanity. It is a curious fact that\nthe one question above till which is\nuppermost in the minds of manu\nfacturers and other employers of la\nbor, and wh^ch is privately discuss\ned by them with helpless iteration.\nIs no rarely touched upon In public\nUtterances. The hope of developing\nsomo remedy is the only consolation\nto employers when they face the\njiroapect of Recline in the volume\n<5f business.\nThere has been extraordinary de\nmand for labor of all kinds. So far as\nthat has raised wages and direitl>"\nincreased the cost of production\nemployers have had no grievance,\nalthough it is a troublesome and\ndifficult matter to carry them back\nto the normal level. Manufacturers\nknow that prices for their products\nusually decllno more rapidly than\nthe labor cost, and must be willing\nto face fliat BOntiBBeticy, fhe laws\nof supply and demand newer oper\nate so promptly In the one case as\nthey do in the other.\nAs for the quantity af output if\nlabor, that, too, responds fairly well\nwhen the demand for labor declines.\nThe process.of weeding out the lazy\nand the inefficient begins promptly,\nand It may be accepted as a general\nfact that few managers have not\n^ thoroughly examined their rolls with\na view toward making their selec\ntions, The percentage usually wll!\nVie shiali. but th6 moral effect Is\nquite out of proportion to the num\nbers. During the past two years the\nknowledge that a job was waiting\nfor any man who was willing to take\nit has had-a demoralizing effect up\non all labor throughout the country.\nThe fact will be firmly^ realized soon (\nthat steadiness, reasonable industry 1\n\' and acquiescence in necessnry tneas- ,\nures of discipline are primary con\n-dltions for employment, and, that\nsimple application for work, is not\nthe only qualification.\nWhat the Iron Age says of the dire\neffects of inefficient labor ta true and\nif it is becoming so grave as to men\nace the general, Industrial situation\nof the country, then it Is well for\nthe laboring man to pause and re\nflect upon his own efficiency. If he\nis doing slouchy work when he\nknows that he can do better or if\nhe realizes that ..he lacks the requi\nsite education and training to en\nable him to bring his work up to a\nj good standard, then he should reflect\ni seriously upon the necessity of im\n. proving himself .and his work. .\n1 Employers, too, Bhould not be in\ndifferent to these things and ^hey\nshould take what measures they can\nto put a stop to inefficient workman\nship. Wherever they find a work\nman in their employ who lacks those\nnecessary things he ought to possess,\nthey should for the \'Sake of mutual\nadvantage and profit do what they\ncan to help their employes.\nThis question of inefficient labor\nis one that concerns others who are\ndoing work besides the artisan.\nEvery Workman should ask himself\n"What kind of work am T doing?"\nand govern himself accordingly. And\nhis employer should see that the in\nterrogation goes home.\nBoth Clarksburg and the State\nBoard of Trtide have cause for con\ngratulation that -this city has been\nselected as the place for the next an\nnual meeting of that important body.\nThe board couldn\'t select a better\nj place for its meeting and Clarksburg\ncouldn\'t have any.better convention\nto entertain as its meeting here will\nresult In much good for the develop\nment of the city., as well as this sec\ntion of the State which holds an im\nportant place in the general com-,\nmercial and .Industrial advancement\nof the State. When the State Board\nof Trade comes next year it will not\nonly find a hustling, growing city\nbut hustlers in it who will be willing\nand glad to help along the objects\nof the organization.\nTestimony has been brought out\nbefore the Public Service Commis\nsion of New York City that some of\nthe big guns of the Metropolitan\nSecurities Company had a man to\nbuy up a street railway franchise\nfor a quarter of a million, got the\n.Metropolitan to buy it in for nearly\na million, and thei> divided up the\ndifference. Not a rail was laid nor\nany rolling stock purchased with the\nrailroad franchise, and the road was\nlisted with the assets of the Metro\npolitan at nearly a million dollars.\nWhich shows that the big traction\nmerger in the leading city was not\nonly soaked but pretty well drained\nalso. No wonder John D. Rocke\nfeller is wearing a green vest.\nGreat shades of Anhauser bush!\nThe statement is sent out in press\ndispatches from Washington that\nthe price of beer all over the United\nStates will be raised soon on account\nof the heavy Increase in the cost to\nthe brewers. This startling news\nshould not be received with undue\nalarm by consumers as it may after\nall lie only a clever advertising dodge\non the part, of the brewers to Induce\nil thirsty populace to take advant\nage of the P?tgeiJt. bargain rate of a\nDickie a glass. \' ,\nThe King of England has offered\na new fangled patent sound trutiS"\nmitter from an American manufac\nturer to aid his hearing.

When questioned regard\ning the report that *he Western Elec\ntric Company, the concern that\nmanufactures the apparatus used by\nthe Bell companies, would hereafter\n?ihones and supplies to all\nbuyers, President Theodore N. Vail,\nof the American Telephone & Tele\ngraph Company, confirmed this re\nport. He ?Jtpjalned that the idea\nhad been under consideration for a\nlong time, but that heretofore one\ndifficulty had been that the Western\nElectric Company needed more\nplant, its full energies being requir\ned to supply the demand of the Bell\ncompanies alone.\nThis obstacle to doing a general\nbusiness has been overcome by the\nrecent completion of very large ad\nditions to the Chicago factory of the\nWestern Electric Company and\nhence it is now In a position to take\ncare of outside orders. In \'reply to\na question as to the probable effect\nof this action on the revenues of the\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph\nCompany, Mr. Vail said ^hat no con\nsiderable direct increase was antici\npated. but that a great indirect ad\nvantage was looked for from im\nproved relation between the jjublic\nand all of the associated Bell com\npanies because there has been an\nentirely erroneous idea more or less\nprevalent that the charges of these\ncompanies for their services were\nbased on a monopoly of telephone\ninstruments while the fact is. that,\nthe instrument is but a small part\nof the plant required in giving tele\nphone servic*. vanrra\nIt is felt that this action may\ncause It to be more clearly under\nstood by the public that the Bell\ncompanies\'s only claim for patron\nage is based on their ability to fur\nnish the best service at reasonable\nprices and not on- any Instrument\nmonopoly. Mr. Vail explained that,\nat the present time, many Inefficient\ntelephone instruments are in use on\nlocal and party lines and that th-?\nBell companies desire to see these re-\'\nplaced by standard instruments, In\norder that it may make traffic con\nnections with the greatest possible\nnumber of properly equipped lines,\nassuring proper service and trans\nmission.\nFor example, there/are thousands\nso-called farmers\' lines, which will\nturnfsh valuable feeders for tho loll\nlines of the larger system, when\nproperly equipped and maintained.\nThis situation can now be provided\nfor through the sale outright (ft Bell\ninstruments and apparatus.\nIn answer to the question as to\nwhether It was intended that the\nWestern Electric Company should\nbecome an- aggressive competitor of\nthe Independent manufacturers, who,\nup to this time, have had a monopoly\nof the selling trade, the only reply\n>\nwas that the Bel! Interests were fu\'\nly prepared either from the manu\nfacturing or operating slda of the\nbusiness to meet all the needs of th?\npublic and that they wish to demon\nstrate that they claimed or asked no\nadvantages other than their ability\nto meet, those needs under square\ncompetitive conditions of quality and\nprice. There could be no trade" wj.r,\nbut any manufacturers who have\nbeen getting high prices f#r inferior\ngoods under that rild monopoly cf\nthe selling trade would naturally\nssiffer a loss of business.\nSWEET MELODY FLOUR\nj THOSE DELICIOUS LKMOX PIES\nThe kind that "made your mouth\nI water" are easilv* made with tlo fus\nsing and at the least possible ex\npense if you use "OUSt-PIE" Prep\naration.
