Then came the new idea, Just car- (\nried to success, which ma<le men,\ndoubt If were arty limits to the\nheight of the skyscraper.

He was\nso phased with the Yarmouth bloat\nera that were served piping hot,\nthat one of jthe feminine guests went\nto the market the next day to -order\nsome for him, to be sent to Sussex\nplace, where he wos staying.\n"I don\'t send so far," said the fish\nmonger. ?

Youth\'s Companion.\n1ARLV RISING fS CONOEMNEI.\n\\ Habit Which May Severely Tax the\nVital Powers.\nThere is no adequate support for\ntne impression that the early morning\nhours are in any way more wholesome\nor healthy than later periods of the\nday. Except In summer time they\nare apt to he rlamn, foggy, chilly and\namong the least desirable hours of\n4?8rtt?ht. It 1b quite true that during\nChe summer there is a< sense of exhil\naration -abmit being abroad in these\nearly morning hours, but this evapo\nrates with the. dew and is apt to be\nbucceeded by a corresponding depres\nsion and loss of ? working po*er later\nIn the day. I have been vGtJBerving my\nfriends and paMents for the p:-.st 20\nyears in this respect, and am inclined\nto the opinion that not a little of the\niepression and nervejhsness which\ncommonly develop in not weather is\ndue to excessive exposure to light,\nfrom habits of early rising, inherited\nfrom agricultural ancestors, not coun\nteracted by three to four hours\' rest\nin darkened rooms In the middle of\nthe day.\nSecondly, that the exhilaration ex\nperienced during . the early morning\nhours is an , expensive luxury which\nhas to be paid for later in the day.\nIn fact, I have found that as a general\nrule, to put it very roughly, the busi\nness or professional tnan who rises\nan hour before 7:30 or 8, goes to\nbed, or loses his working power\nan hour and a <? half earlier in the\nevening. ftach individual has in\nthe beginning of his day about so\nmuch working power stored up <n his\nbrain and muscle cells. If he usen\nthis up with great rapidity in the\nearly morning hours he naturally ex\nhausts his stock the sooner in th*>\nafternoon.\nIt is largely a matter of when a\ntnan wjshes to be at his best. If his\noccupation is of sucn a character that\nhe can clear off the brunt of his\nwork in the eai\'Iy morning hoilrs, then\nlet him rise early.. :lt on- the oticv\nband he requires full vigor And readi\nness of mind and body in the latter\npart of the day, or at night, then\nhe must rise l?ter to get it. Even\nin pure muscle work it is false econ\nomy to work too long hours ?

"If that Is all/\' said Petefr,\n\'we will aooh cure It; take me to her\nit once." When they arrived, the Wom\nan declared that she was not suffering\nat all; there was nothing .the. matter\nwith her. "That is the way she talks,\nyour majesty,\'- said the valet; "?he is\nsuffering tortures." "Hold her head\nand hands," said the czar; "I will\nhave it out in a moment." And he in\nstantly pulled out the indicated tooth\nwith great dexterity, amid profuse\nthanks from the husband.

His majesty was visiting a\nschool in a small country district. A\nlocal official, anxious to impress the\nsovereign with the i rogressive ideas\nprevailing in the community, called\nhja attention to the fact that the\ngchoolhouse was provided with bathu\nfor the pupils.\nThe emperor showed the liveliest In\nterest, and immediately asked to see\nthe bathroom, whereupon the director\nof the school looked extremely un\ncomfortable. The key could not be\nfound for some time, and his majesty\nbegan to get impatient. Finally it was\nproduced, and the eager official opened\nthe door.\nThe emperor stepped into a verit\nable lumberrootn, filled with a choice\ncollection of broken desks and chairs\nand waste paper that completely hid\nthe bath equipment.\nThe emperor stepped quickly out\nagain, and as he did so was heard to\nmurmur: "Serves me right.

Detroit Free Pre?a.\nHi\nlapMlait t* luehsrs\n*\nThe problem of properly and equita\nbly distributig irrigating waters in case\nof shortage has worried the ranchers\nand others of Nevada for some years,\nbnt the question is now shaping for an\naccurate and speedy solution, says the\nCarson News. In several places in the\nState the ranchers are willing and anx\nious to take the proper and necessary\nsteps voluntarily at the present time\naiid without the assistance of tha State,\nbut in other places they desire to\nhave a statute passed by the coming\nsession of the Legislature which will j\ncover the problem and solution. The\nquestion is a vital one, especially to\nthose having rights on the lower part\nof a stream.\nUnder the present\' State law when\nthere is a water shortage water com\nmissioners are appointed whose duties\nconsist.of making the proper distribu\ntion according to the rights and prior\nities of the ranchers along the course\nof the stream or who receive their\nsupply from such stream. These com\nmissioners estimate the water flowing\nand then estimate the distribution;\nthere is no certainty to their work and\nthey have no manner of knowing how\nnear the actual flow they figure on.\nOften their work is very good, for in\nstance State Engineer Nicholas discov\nered several days ago that water com\nmissioners in Carson valley had est:- j\nmated the actual flow within 900 in\nches. The men made the estimate\nwithout instruments or any method of\narriving at their decision otherwise\nthan experience. Though their esti\nmate was remarkably close, yet this\n900 inches as under-estimated would\nirrigate 900 acres of land, as it requires\nabout an inch to the acre.\nRanchers and water owners along the\nstreams affected, and warmly approved\nby the State Engineer\'s office, are to\ninstall a system of weirs along the\nstream and also at the head gates of\neach ditch. Under this plan a weir\nwould he placed, for instance, on Car\nSDn river alx>ve the place where the\nirrigation begins, then a weir would l>e\nplaced at the headgate on each ditch\nleading from the stream. Weirs are so\nconstructed that the exact amount of\nwater passing through can be measured\nand by such a system, the priorities and\nrights being established, each rancher\nwill receive exactly the water to which\nhe is entitled. The necessary weirs\nare of easy and cheap construction,\nbeing no more than a sort of sluice-way\nmade of concrete and wood and cost\ning at an ordinary headgate al>out $10\nto $15 each. They will be made in\nwidths of 3, 6, 9 and 12 feet.\nIt is proposed to have the State erect\nthese on the river or main streams\nsuch as the Muddy, Humboldt, Truckee\nand Carson rivers; those at the head\ngates to be erected by the owner of\nsuch ditches. There will be no cost of\nmaintenance and once the system is\nestablished, the j)roblem of water dis\ntribution will l>e settled where the\nrights are determined.\nStewart-Mayer Race Was Declared Oil\nAs predicted in Monday\'s "Star," the\nfootrace at Elko between Jiminy Stew\nart and "Babe" Mayer had to Ik; de\nclared off owing to there being no pos\nsibility of running it under the rules\nwhich had been agreed upon. After\nthe fiasco of Sunday afternoon, when\nfifty-eight attempts to secure a start\nwere made without success, John Sa\nval, Stewart\'s backer, endeavored to\nI have the other side agree to rules un\nder which the race could bo pulled off,\nbut Mayer and his backers turned\ndown every proposition made. One of\n; the propositions made by Saval was\n, to run the race in Salt Lake City un\n| der rules which would assure a fair\n1 start, he offering to pay all the trav\n? eling expenses of Mayer and his back\n1 ers, but they refused to run the race\nj under any other conditions except\ni those under which Mayer, by continual\ni breaking, made a fiasco out of the\nI whole business hist Sunday.\nAs the situation stands, it looks very\nmuch like a backdown by Mayer and\nhis backers and the race has l>een de\nclared off indefinitely. It is expected\nthat all the l>ets, amounting to over\n$.5,000, will be taken down, as there\nseems to be no possibility of pulling\noff the racc.?

The most re-!\nmarkable thing In connection with the;\nbellbird is its powerful voice; it ut\nters a clear, metallic note which can,\nbe heard at a distance Of three miles.\nIts noise is like that produced by a\nblacksmith striking his anvil. Some-j\ntimes it repeats ftp notes in quick I\nsuccession, sometljja.w at fairly long,\nIntervali.
