XLII., NO. 29\nGERMANS STILL\nFALLING BACK\n70,00(1 PRISONERS IN A MONTH\nAllies Have Taken Many Miles of\nTerritory Since the Aborted .Ger\nman Drive of July 15.\nGerman arms have suffered the\nmost serious disaster since the first\ntattle of the Marne, in September,\n1914. In many respects this disaster\nit even more serious than the one of\nfour years ago, because at that time\nthe successful French and British\ntroops were too raw and untrained to\nfollow up the advantage gained, while\nnow they are prepared to take the of\nfensive.\nThe losses by the Germans, in pris\noners alone since their big \\ drive—\nwhich completely reversed itself—be\ngun on July 16, just ope month ago\ntoday, have been near 70,000. The\nnumoer of their killed and wounded\nmust have been terrible.\nThe recent British and French of\nfensive, with Montdidier as its center,\nbeginning a week ago, has slowed\ndown, but the enemy is being slowly\npushed back. The territory recap\ntured from the enemy is nearly 50\nmiles in length and has a maximum\ndepth of a little more than 12 miles.\nAs in the case of the Marne defeat,\nthe Germans not only lost heavily in\nmen but an unusually large number\nof heavy guns and ammunition, be\nsides a great amount of war material,\nfell into the hands of the allies.\nTwo German commanders have been\nrelieved of their commands as a result\nof this retreat. One general and his\nstaff were captured.\nTrank H. Simonds, one of the best\ninformed war writers, states that\nijow, fof the fipst time since the Rus\npjn [weakdnwp, the alhes are about\nftp! |h fighting strength to the Ger\nman» pn the western front. Accord\ning ta his estimates, prior to the ar\nrival of American troops, the British\ntod oijly shout 1,000,000 available\nfighting men in the trenches, and the\nFrench about 1,226,000. As against\nthis combined fighting strength of\n2.226.000, the Germans had about\n2300 . 000 , a little more than a half\nmillion more than the allies. Of\ncourse there were reserves, but these\nnumbers were actually engaged.\nAmerica now has 1,500,000 in France,\nbut not more than million will ever\ngo into battle, the others being need\ned for other purposes incident to the\nwar. Possibly not more than a quar\nter, of a million are now thoroughly\nfisined for service, but in a \'few weeks\n>t post a| least enough will be trained\nto offset Germany\'s prepondrance of\naen.\nAs Germany and Austria have about\nexhausted their available source of\n•apply of men, it can readily be seen\nÜt with\na constantly increasing\nffRWtoffB pf fpfish fighters, next\nmf should si-i; Hi: end of the war, un\n[pss something unforseen occurs.\nAt present a heretofore unlooked\nm Mp for the Allies seems to be\ngjNogmg in Russia. The Bolshi\nyjk government Is crumbling, and then\nIf Russia never gets back in the fight\nmg, it will be a constant menace to\ntile central powers, and a large num\nber of troops will be required to pre\nvent trouble.\nThe only fear that now confronts\nthe allies is the fact that Germany\nMems to be forcing Russians into the\n•rmy. In this case they may be put\nJmong German soldiers and forced\nfight the allies.\n?\n1 11\nDEFENSE LEAGUE\nORGANIZED MONDAY\nPresident Wilson Patriotically Sup\nported And Senator Vardaman De\nsereedly Denounced.\nSummoned by previous call, there\nw&s a great meeting of our town and\ntounty voters in thecourthouse last\nMonday night to form a local defense\nin support of the President\'s\nlt$olicy and take steps to properly\n|J«y attempted state antagonism\nÜPe same.\n% eight o\'clock the courthouse\ntel with our patriotic citizens to\na pumber of 260, while a compara\nit«.- our leading citizenesses\nSyjne early future graced the great\nwas\nf\nThe meeting was called to order by\nA - Smith, who had been un\n«œcmily chosen as temporary chair\n\'Official nominations being in\niSj Y® Smith was unanimously\nri,» 1 ™ as P e rmanent president and\ngSBcery clerk, Colonel B.

L. Rush,\nPeyton, Miss,\nDear Sir; I beg to acknowledge\nreceipt of your letter, which is in the\nfollowifig words and figures to-wit:\n"It is being rumored through this\nsection that Mr. Garrison didn\'t\namount to much and had lost out in\nhis District. I understand that you\nare one of the gentlemen that he de\nlea ted for Congress, and that you are\nnow supporting him, being a former\nVardaman supporter. If this is true,\nlit seems to me you could say some\ntiling good for Mr. Harrison, you be\nmg very favorably known in this sec\ntion. 1 would appreciate it very much\nif you would write me how you feel\nin the matter, and assure you that I\n.ould use your letter only as you di\nrect."\nby\nof\nni\nthe\nthe\nlet\nsea\nin\nReplying to your letter, will say\nthat it is true that Mr. Harrisofi de\nfeated me in this District for Con\ngress in the year 1910 and I have\nnever made the race against him since\nthat time for the reason that he al\nways made us a good Congressman,\nin fact an excellent Congressman.\nOne gentleman in this District saw\nfit to run against him in 1914, and as\nI remember was defeated by Mr. Har\nrison about 11 to 1. My judgment is\nthat Mr. Harrison will carry this Dis\ntrict overwhelmingly for the Senate\nin the coming Primary.\nMr. Harrison is an excellent man\nand in as much as he has stood with\nthe Democratic party in its various\nmeasures J feel that he will absolute\nly stand with the Democratic party\nuntil the war is over and especially\nin making the terms of peace, as the\nUnited States Senate will have\nratify the treaty the President makes.\nI know he will stand by the Presi\ndent and for his past efficiency and\nfuture hope, I am doing everything\nthat is fair and honest to aid him in\nhis election. It is true that I have\nformerly been a supporter of Senator\nVardaman; stumped the State for him\nin 1911 and I am his personal friend\ntoday, but I cannot approve of the\nstand he has taken with reference to\nour President and the Democratic par\nty since he has been in the United\nStates Senate; and since he still says,\nthat if it were to do over he would do\nagain, I therefore fear that he will\ncontinue to fight the President and\nthe Democratic party if he is re-elect\ned. This is Ehe wpy 1 fee! about it.\nI have tried to study the matter fair\nly and my conscience will not permit\nme to take any other course than the\none I am now taking.\nin\nto\nt"\n19\nour\nare\nis\nit\nthe\non\nIn\nYours very truly,\nJOHN R.

At night I would get\nup six or eight times and I lost weight\nbecause I couldn\'t get my right\nsleep. 1 felt tired and languid all\nday and the secretions were highly\ncolored and unnatural. About three\nyears ago 1 decided to give Doan\'s\nKidney Pills a trial. I didn\'t have\nmuch faith in this medicine at first\nand didn\'t get any relief from the\nfirst few doses, but I made up my\nmind I would finish the box and at\nthe end of a week, I noticed improve\nment. I bought another box and they\nentirely cured me." (Statement giv\nen May 8, 1914).\nOn February 20, 1918, Mr. Arnette\nsaid: "I have used Doan\'s Kidne\nPills on one or two occasions since\nmade my last statement and 1 always\nreceive the same, good results.

In the industrial Unrest that\nfollowed, accompanied by many F\nstrikes and the growing evil of non\nemployment, the tramp nuisance rose\nto enormous proportions and proved\na great burden, expense and even j\ndanger to the country,\'\nThe dignified letter of President D.\n,\nWilson on the """tonal contest came\nas a shock to Mr. Vardanian and his\n«üpporters who have been claiming\nthat the Junior Senator is supporting\nthe administration. Mr Wilson did\nnot thrust himself into Mississippi\npolitics—simply answered the alto- E.\ngether pertinent question asked him,\nand no fair-minded Mississippian. *\nwhether a Vanlaman supporter or not,\ncan criticise the president\'s letter.\nMr. Wilson has enlightened those who\n~\neide between Wilson and Vardaman.\nVardamnn\'s whole ,\nvardaman whole attitude ha. been\npro-German, Mr. Wilson is a true\nAmerican.

Irwin ia\nreminiscent to his friends in a well\nspent career. His modesty shun pub\nlicity, yet he was a leader in our po\nlitical and professionad affairs. In re\nconstruction times, the south had no\nstauncher defender. The assassina\ntion of his friends John Briscoe and\nCaptain CharleB Buck tested his cour\nage to restore order in our tumultous\ncounty. He succeeded to the unex\npired term of John Briscoe as circuit\nclerk. A all round office man he served\nas deputy sheriff, deputy clerk\nand deputy assessor. Like Washing\nton he was a conscientious surveyor\nand skilled draughtman. The record\ned surveys in the chancery clerk\'s office\nof Irwin\'s are models that equal the\nstandard of the generation of J. O.\nStagg, Thomas H. Jones and Eratus\nShields. He retired from politics in\n1907 after his defeat for circuit clerk\nby the efficient S. H. Bagnell. His\nlast work the county map for the\nBoard of Supervisors is a masterpiece\nof cartography, showing the high in\ntellect that was spurred by acute suff\nering.
