MIGHELS Lessek\nTHURSDAY APHIL 18\nLOOT IN THE PHILIPPINES.\nIt is what, in the vernacular of the\nstreet earner, is usually termrd \'an\nopen secret" tint theie Ins been a\ngreat deal of quiet pilfering in con\nnection with the furnishing of the\narmy in the Philippines with subsist\nence. TUi-j surreptitious looting co.n\nmenceJ here, in Sn Francisco, before\nthe first army was moved at all Con\ntracts for supplies were entered into\nupoi terms which, no business nin\nwould think of entertaining is a com\nme-rcial proposition, and charter par\nties were m de with steamship own\ners th it \'vce, to put it mildly, ver\nioequiiible. A fairl review of the\nwhoie situation discloses \'.he fact tha;\na great deal of unearned profit was\nmade by somebody under conditions\nthat raise a presumption of \'addition,\ndivisiqn and. silence." A"d this pre\nsumption was strengthened and re\nen force 1 by subsequent develop ments\nThe volunteers who went to the Phil\nIppiues in th Srst expedition all, or\nnearly all, complainedof.the fact that,\nwhile they were poorly provided for\nGovernment stores.andfeven the Red\nCr03S Society\'s supplies, were fteely\nsold to those who had the money a no\'\nthe inclination to buy. Still later\nthere came from Manila fitful and in\ntermittent rumors of queer doings in !\nthe commissary department of the\nAmerican army. The returning sol\ndiers, too, told strange tales in regard\nto thesa matters; but then plain sol\ndier do notjhave large- opportunities\nfor observing things, and are apt to\nmake np for their deficiency in know\nledge by mixing a little fiction with\ntheir ficts. Still, where there was so\nmuch smoke there must, thoughtful\nobservers realized, be some 6re. Now\nthe cat is entirely out of the bag, and\nsome of the rascals are nnder arrest\nThe Government stores at Manil\nhave been (systematically robbed by\nthose having charge of them. Commissary-General\nWeston, in his com\nfortable office chair in Washington,\nsays that he doj3 not believe th U\nthere have been extensive frauds He\nis reported as expressing himself in\nthis way in ?n interview:\n"Not a whip.r of anything of the\nkind has reached me. I received souh\nthree days ago a dispatch irom Col\nonel Woodruff", chief commissary of\nthe Philippines, reporting the amount\nof stores on hand, and tod rv similar\nmessages ieicr.ed me. Neither con\ntains any reference to the alleged\nfrauds."\nIf not even "a whisper of anything\nof the kind" has reached the General\nne snoni l consult an aunst.

The whbperings of the\nreturned soldieis were so loud tint no\none co\'ild h ive any doubt but that\nsomething was wrong at Manila.\nExactly what, no outsider could te\'d\nBut Commissary-General Weston is\nnot an outsider. He has the records\nof his department at hand, and they\nshould show the amount of supplies\nthat are being consumed by the army\nin the Philippines.

Steam power is at\nthe present time going out of use from\nthe fact that woed and coal are too\nhigh to allow profit from its ute. Of\nlate years gasoline eniues""bave been\nintroduced and at the present time\nttiey are in the lead of steam from the\nfact that they generate as much power\nwith less expense.\nThe Uuion Gas Engine Company\nof San Francisco, after nearly twenty\nyears of manufacturing, have placed\non the market thousands of engines\nthat are doing actual work. They are\nbuilt for all kinds and conditions of\nwork. Ir. the State of California\nthousands of fie-res of land are irrigated\nwil l) tliee eiiutue. In this State the\nsame s-ysicne siieuld he adopted. In\nnea ny every locality water can be ob\ntained within twentv feet and by con\nnecting one of the-e engines more\nwater cau he secured than by any\ni.itilicial means.
