Etheringtun\nC ÏIREE flights of stairs, steep\nand uneven, led up to Stephen\nChurchill\'s studio. They pre\nsented serious difficulties, espe\ncially on n hot afternoon, to so plump\na man as John Gregory, art editor of\nthe Traveler, and he paused at the\nhead of the second flight aud vainly\ntried to fan himself with a soft alpine\nbat.\nHe was somewhat sensitive in regard\nto bis weight, aud so he made a thin\nexcuse for this bait, pretendiug that he\nhad something to say to his companion,\na brown eyed girl in a white dress.\n"Remember," said he as Impressively\nas he wag able with tbe breath that\nwas in him, "remember that I am not\nresponsible for Steve Churchill. He is\na good artist and a bad man—a dan\ngerous man."\n"We have flirtatious meu at home,"\nsaid she, "In that respect Mr. Churchill\nwill not be a novelty. But we have no\nmen there who could have painted \'The\nCliff\'s Edge.\' Tt is Mr. Churchill, the\nartist, whom your little country cousin\nwants to meet. Lead on, Jack, when\nyou get your breath."\n"I despise these fellows who pursue\nevery pretty face," he began.\n"Perhaps he won\'t think I\'iu pretty,"\nsaid she demurely. "Besides, I\'ll tell\nhim right away that I\'m engaged."\n• "Well, that may do some good," mut\ntered Gregory, \'\'as the sailor said when\nhe dropped an anchor with no cable\nfastened to It."\nThere were other visitors in Church\nill\'s studio when Gregory and his cous\nin entered, and In the midst of them\nstood the artist at his easel, hard at\nwork. He was a man of unimpressive\nappearance except for his air of ear\nnestness. He had blue eyes and light\nbrown hair, a clear skin and a fairly\ngood flgnre— altogether a commonplace\nyoung man whose looks did not give\nthe smallest suggestion of bis ability\nunless one happened to remember that\n"genius Is the capacity for taking Infi\nnite pains." Churchill certainly had the\nfacial expression which would fit that\ndefinition.\nHe did not lay down his palette when\nGregory introduced him to "tho coun\ntry cousin," and he seemed to take no\nespecial interest in her except at the\nmention of the fact that she was an\nartist. Then he looked at her sympa\nthetically, as If Gregory had said that\nabe suffered from some chronic and\npainful ailment. Immediately he re\nturned to bis work without offering an\napology, but for several minutes lie\ncontinued to converse with Gregory\nand Miss Talbot, wandering ever far\nther away from them until his voice\nseemed tq become inaudible ip the far\nbackground of the landscape on the\neasel,\nHelen Talbot laughed softly all the\nway down the three flights of stairs.\nM\nv,\n&\nBE LOOKED AT HEB SYMPATHETICALLY.\nand her enjoyment was the greater be\ncause of Gregory\'s extraordinary mut\ntering aud head shaking.\n"I\'ll tell you what\'s a fact, Helen,"\nhe said as they came out upon the side\nwalk, "something bas struck Steve\nChurchill. I never saw him act like\nthat before."\n"Dangerous, dangerous man!" laugh\ned the girl. "Where on earth did you\nget that Idea of him ?"\n"The thing that makes me afraid for\nyou, Helen,\'\' said he, "whether it\'s a\nquestion of trolley cars, express wag\nons or unprincipled men, 1 b that you\ntreat peril by the faith cure and deny\nits existence."\n"And yon imagine Its existence," she\nçptorted. "But, seriously. Jack," she\ngdded, "I am tremendously obliged to\nyou for taking me to see Mr. Churchill.\nI have paid $100 for a course of lessons\nand have learned less from It than I\nlearned from the pictures !n that stu\ndio and from the man himself at\nwork."\n\'\'Churchill not only has individual\nmethod," sai l Gregory, "bn. he has all\nkinds of » You can\'t help pick\ning up sou.--\'!.lug that will help you.\nHowever, I\'m interested In the man\njust now, not In tbe artist What tbe\ndickens has come over him?"\nHelen offered no solution of tbe prob\nlem, and presently they parted. A few\ndays later the girl appeared In the art\ndepartment of tbe Traveler, and every\nartist looked over tbe tojf of hla draw\ning board while she was passing\nthrough the room. Indeed they never\nfniled to do so. It would have been\npossible for Helen to deny them this\npleasure by taking a somewhat longer\nroute to her cousin\'s room—perhaps a\ndozen yards longer, Involving the loss\nof several seconds—but she always\nconvinced herself that she was In a\nhurry. Admiration Is of course pleas\nant to a pretty girl, and there Is no\nreason why she should go out of her\nway to avoid tt,\n"I\'ve learned that Mr. Churchill has\na class of art," said she. "Why didn\'t\nyou tell me?"\n"It slipped my mind," answered\nGregory, frowning at a drawing.\n"WelL" said Helen, "I\'ve Joined It"\nGregory settled down a little farther\ninto his chair.\n"Mr. Churchill is a great natural\nteacher,\'\' the girl continued, "but be\ndiscourages |ne."\n"Why?" inquired Gregory.\n"Because he evidently does not think\nI have any ability," sbo replied.. "He\ngives me all the attention { could ask,\nbut it Is perfectly obvious that he does\nso because his conscience compels\nhim."\n"Churchill\'s conscience!" mattered\nGregory,\n"By the way," satd Helen, "I asked\nsome of the other pupils whether they\nhad noticed any change In him, and\nthey hadn\'t. But none of them knew\nhim very well."\n"No," said Gregory, guess they\ndidn\'t."\n•\'It certainly seems to me," persisted\nHelen, "that Mr. Churchill has some\nthing on bis mind. He talks to me as If\nhe didn\'t see me at ftfi, I should think\nhe was looking at somebody standing\nbehind me. Do you suppose be can\nhave met with any mlsfortnne?"\n"None that he doesn\'t deserve,"\ngrowled Gregory,\nHelen rose from her chair with tbe\nair of one who has reached, tbe limit of\npatience.\n"Well, It\'s not very flattering.\'\' said\nshe, "and I\'d like to know what ft\nmenus. However," she added after a\nmomentary pause, "I\'m bound to say\nthat so far as I can see he treats all the\nother girls Just the same way,"\n\'\'Churchill always had an Indifferent\nmanner," responded Gregory. "It\'s not\nthat that makes me think him changed.\nThere seems to be a new purpose In the\nfellow, an energy and an ambition that\nI never saw before. Upon my word, 1\ncould almost believe that he has been\ncaught at his own game and that some\ngirl has made a dent In his vulcanized\nrubber heart."\n"The same notion occurred to me,"\nsaid Helen. And presently she went\naway without having given any satis\nfactory reason wtiy she had called.\nIt may have been about two weeks\nlater tbat Helen happened to be In the\nvicinity of Churchill\'s studio about an\nhour before the time for the assembling\nof the cIrss. R seemed better to wait\nin the studio than anywhere else tbat\nshe could think of at tbe moment.\nDoubtless some of the other pupils\nwould arrive early and keep her com\npany. Churchill himself would be no\ncompany at all, as she hod already\nlearned. Ho would attend strictly to\nbis work and forget her existence.\nUpon this occasion, however, the art\nist was not at work, or, to be more ex\nact, he was not at his usual task, lie\nsat by a desk upon which were many\nletters which he had written. Wien\nHelen entered he looked at her for\nsome seconds Intently, as If trying to\nbriug his mind to her from some re\nmote region.\n"How do you do?" snkl he In n far\naway voice. And then when she was\nseated he resumed his place at the\ndesk and slowly tore all tbe letters Into\nvery small pieces. Afterward he put\nsomething which looked like a locket or,\nvery small metal picture frame into a\ndrawer of the desk and turned tbe key\nupon It\n"Mr. Churchill," said she, "I have\nbeen talking with my cousin about\nyou."\n"Yes?" he responded, with only ths\nfaintest show of Interest.\n"He finds you greatly changed," said\nthe girl.\nimmediately a very obvions and sur\nprising change revealed Itself in the\nman. He rose with energy, and his\neyes grew bright.\n"I have good reason," he said.\nShe smiled and pointed to the drawer\nin the desk.\nChurchill hesitated and then slowly\nturned. He opened the drawer and\ntook from it something which the girl\ncould not see until he held it toward\nher. It wus, as she had guessed, ft\nsmall round frame of plain gold con\ntaining a face cut from a photograph,\nthe face of a very pretty girl, yet not\nsuch a girl as might be expected to ac\ncomplish a great and beneficial change\nin a man like Churchill.\nTo be honest about It, site looked vain\nand silly. As a mat for a genius she\nmight fulfill the doleful traditions Ig\nregard to this subject, but youth al\nways fights against tradition- Certain\nly Helen rebelled at Ibe thought that\nsuch a doll should sway the destinies\nof a man whose most eotnmonptaee\nIdea and lowliest aspiration she must\nalways be totally nnahle to sppreetate.\n"Isn\'t she lovely?" she exclaimed.\n"Bine eyes, of course, like yours. How\nodd!"\n"It\'s odd that any girl should care a\n! penny for me," responded Churchill, re\n| lapsing into his former manner. "I\'m\nj not worth It."\nI He began to pace restlessly up nnd\nj down the studio, in which exercise he\nwas interrupted by the entrance of\nj some members of his class,\ni It may have been a month after this\nthat Helen came early to the studio\nagain, but this is not to say that she\nhad never done so in the meantime. A\npeculiar fascination had brought her\nthere more thon once. Why she came\nshe snrely did not kuow. Churchill\nnever seemed particularly glad to see\nber, nnd their conversation was often\ndepressing, though Helen always strove\nto lift It to the highest level of aspira\ntion and artistic enthusiasm.\nIf she had any comprehensible pur\npose it was to put the man at his best.\nReally she was fighting against the\ndoll\'s face in the gold frame, protest\n«\nSHE WAS STAKING AT A PHOTOGRAPH,\nlng against the ascendency of tbe\nworse side of Churchill\'s nature, for,\ngftPP all, when a man leaves running\nafter pretty faces and begins to run\nafter one pretty face ho is not much\nthe better for the change. A man\'s\nhigher nature should impel him to seek\n• suitable mate, a woman who can help\nhim and In some measure comprehend\nhim. It seemed to Helen almost a duty\n;\nj\n!\n!\nto show Churchill that not all pretty !\nwomen were dolls; that one of them j\nmight possibly be a companion aud\neven an equal In her own way.\nUpon the day tbat has been mention\ned Churchill was not looking his best.\nHe was somewhat pale; he seemed to\nhave grown older, and all the lines in\nhis face were intensified. He greeted\nher with his customary indifference,\nand then it all suddenly fell away from\nhim.\n"Helen," said he—for she had per\nmitted him that liberty with her name\n—"I am going to say goodby to you\nnow before any one else comes, though\nI may see you again even after today."\n"Goodby!" she echoed, amazed.\n"I\'m going away," he said hurriedly.\n"I\'m going abroad—or somewhere. I\'m\n•11 out of sorts—broken down. I can\'t\nwork. I need a change."\n"Why, what In the world is tho mat\nter?" she demanded.\nHe hesitated and then almost sprang\nto his desk. In another Instant he had\nshown her the gold frame, empty.\n"It\'s all over," said he. "Better for\nher—much better for her. Ami for me,\nperhaps—I don\'t know—there\'s been\nanother Influence—I\'m not the same\nman."\n"What Influence"— she began.\nHe looked into her eyes. She started\nback.\n\'\'No, no!" she cried. "I did not mean\nto do this."\nHe smiled sadly and extended his\nhand.\n"Goodby," said ho.\nlu the moment that followed they\nboth beard steps upon tho stairs.\n"In a few days you\'ll have forgotten\nall about It," sutd he. "I shall be\ngone\'\'—\nXoi" she cried. "I don\'t want you\nto go."\nIlls hand closed tighter upon hers,\nand then some one knocked at the door.\nAt the close of the session of the class\nHelen went to the Traveler office. She\nwanted to see Gregory, whom she rec\nognized ns her liest available mentor,\nand yet she had by no means decided\nto tell him what had happened. In\nfact, she did not know what really had\noccurred except that she had broken\nChurchill\'s engagement. Her own senti\nments were In wild confusion. She\nseemed to be two different girls, one of\nwhom still remained bound in honor\nand affection to the man who hold her\npromise, while the other was whirling\naway into another part of the universe.\nGregory was not in his office, and no\none seemed to know what had become\nof him. While waiting Helen could not\nbe idle. She seized upon the portfolios\nof the department and ran through\nendless stores of portraits and scenes,\nas if in frantic search for something.\nWhen Gregory entered she was rigid\nas stone, staring at a photograph which\nshe held in her hand.\n"Jack," said she, "who is this?"\nHe glanced over her shoulder.\n"English beauty," he replied. "Used\nto be on tho stage. Dead, poor girl."\n"Dead ?" V\n"Yes, three or four years ago. I\n!\nI\n;\nthought I\'d thrown the picture away." j\n"Jaek," said she, "Mr. Churchill had\nthis girl b picture in «1 frame. ns he ;\nSTtr engaged to her?"\n"To her! Why, he never saw her. \'\nShe never In this country nor he j\nabroad. He made a portrait of her\nj\ni\ni\nonce long ago for the Traveler."\n"Why, he told me"—\n"Yes," said Gregory, sitting down\nheavily. "He told you that you had\nInterrupted a romance. Old game.\nWish you\'d informed nue sooner. But\nyon didn\'t think I knew enough to\nmake It worth while."\n"JftCK," said she, "I\'m going home,—\nno, m go somewhere else for a week\nor two, and then I\'ll go home and stay."\n"That\'s my good little cousin," said\nha heartily. "I\'m glad to hear it."\nHow a Club Went Out of Existence.\nSome years ago about a dozen men\nat Oxford formed A sort of "marriage\nclub." It was agreed that when any\nmember was about to be married a\ndinner should be held which all within\nreach should attend—the bachelors to\npay. Marriage seemed far away then,\naud the bachelors thought tbe divided\nexpenses would be Inconsiderable.\nYears passed nnd now And again the\nannouncement of another marriage\nwas sent around. They met, comiug\nfrom various walks of life—soldier,\nbarrister, solicitor, journalist, school\nmaster, mau about town aud the rest\n—sang the old songs, dug up tho old\nJokes, until one year It happened that\nthe final bachelor found himself sole\nhost. A year later the difficulty arose,\naud the final bachelor was given his\ndinner by the eleven married men.\nAnd now the friends meet on the an\nniversaries of their wedding days and\npay each his own score. There Is per\nhaps the ideal club.—London Chronicle.\nA Delicate Art.\nTo trnusfer nn old oil painting to a\nnew canvas is a branch of art tbat\ncalls for a unison of mechanical skill\nand talent. There are not many men\nin the business. It is an entirely dis\ntinct work from renovating a cracked\nor mutilated painting. Transferring a\npainting from an old canvas to a new\none requires years of experience to ac\ncompllsh the simplest part of It. After\nthe picture has been removed from its\nframe several layers of fine tissue pa\nper are pasted firmly across the sur\nface. When the paper is dry the back\nOf the eanvas Is made thoroughly wet.\nThread by thread It Is picked away\nuntil nothing remains but tbe paint,\nwhich Is fast to the tissue paper. A\nnew canvas is then mounted and glued\nto the back of the picture. When the\nglue Is dry tbe tissue paper is mois\ntened nnd gently removed from the\nsurface. A little cleaning and retouch\ning by a skilled hand make the work\ncomplete.\nNo Brfborr.\nAn amusing episode in politics Is\nvouched for by a minister of religion\nas buvlng occurred near Gillingham,\nEngland. A lady canvasser for one of\nthe local candidates called at a house,\nfound that the voter was out and in\nquired of the wife, "You think he will\ntote for my candidate, do you not?"\n"Indeed he won\'t," replied the wo\nman. "He has been promised a new\npair of trousers If he votes for the\nother man."\nThe lady canvasser scented a peti\ntion for bribery, produced a sovereign\nand said, "I will give you this if you\nwill tell me who made your husband\nthat promise."\n"Certainly I will," said tho voter\'s\nwife as she pocketed the money. "I\npromised him them myself."\nMan and Hla Necktie.\n"Men\'s taste In neckties," says a\nNew York haberdasher, "Is the most\nfickle thing imaginable. You con nev\ner bo sure of It. it often happens that\na scarf pattern which has a tremendous\nrun for a year or two Is reproduced\nafter a few seasons, and no one wants\nto buy it. On the other hand, a de\nsign you could hardly give away this\nyear may become the craze next year.\nWhy, no one has ever been able to dis\ncover. One year men will revel in\nred scarfs nnd the next will have noth\ning but greens or blues or purples.\nTnlk about women\'s taste In dress be\ning uncertain—man\'s is more so.

Matthew in\nMlemae for the Indians of Nova Scotia\nthe translator found when he came to\nrevise it that In chapter xxlv, 7, In\nstead of "nation shall rise against na\ntion" ho had written \'\'a pair of snow\nshoes shall rise up ngaiust u pair of\nsnowshoes." But there was only one\nletter misprinted, naooktukumlksljlk\n(n nation) having been displaced by\nnaooktakundksljlk (a snowshoe).—St.\nJames\' Gazette.\nThe Cause of Earthquakes.\nWhen there Is an earthquake the\nTibetans know Just how it happened.\nThere are evil spirits.

Naturally they\nsuffer from hunger, and in their agon\nizetl writhings they are the immediate\ncause of earthquakes."\nWell Fumfuated.\nSome years ago Mark Twain\'s homo\nIn Hartford was Invaded with scarlet\nfever.

SCANLAND, Editor and Proprietor.\nBENTON, LOUISIANA, THURSDAY, JULY 6, 1906.\nThe advance in the cotton market Monday was\nnot without significance. September advanced 90\npoints net within a few\' hours and the result was\nfelt all over the country. It is very clear that a\nand\nreduced acreage and short crops otherwise are\nhaving an effect in the great cotton centers. With\nadvances of this character, this early in the season,\nwe may rest assured that cotton will bring even a\nbetter price than has been mentioned.\nThe farmers of our own State have been greatly\nhampered by the excessive rains. In many locali\nties the cotton has had so litttle attention that the\nyield will fall off at least 40 per cent. It is a grave\nquestion with many farmers whether they will be\nable to save their crops from the grass, and thou\nsands of acres will no doubt be abandoned. We\nshould say, however, that those who have their\ncrops in anything like fair condition should feel\ngreatly encouraged at the outlook.\nThe Shreveport Journal issued a Souvenir Edition\nin addition to the regular edition of that paper ;\nWednesday of last week, which gave an exhaustive j\nand excellent exhibit of all the great interests of ;\nthat growing and prosperous city. The apprécia- ;\ntion of the enterprise by the business men of,\nShreveport is well marked. Business men know I\nthat such a publication gives tbeir city a name ;\nabroad and increases their commercial standing,\nand are not backward in furnishing material for the\nvaluable work. The phblication of the Souvenir\nEdition cost a large amount of time and money as\nit covered sixty-six pages and contained 190 col\numns.

May the Banner "\nand its staunch bearer live on, prospering more and 1\n:\nJohn Q. Royce, State Bank Commissioner for\nKansas, is authority for the statement that many of\nthe banks in Kansas are owned by the farmers of\nthe wheat belt. He declares that in many counties\nall of the bank stock and the best offices of the\nbanks are in possession of the farmers. Some of\nthe bankers have lelt their farms and moved to the\nvillages because of these investments, but many of\nthem still live on the farms and attend meetings of\nthe directores when notified over their rural tele\nphones by the cashiers.\nThe same thing ought to be true of the cotton\nplanters of the South. It is true in some instances,\nand but for the undervalues which they receive\nfor their product it would be true in many instances.\nThe conditions are changing, however, iç, the South.\nThe farmers have more money to-day than in\nformer years, and their condition is encouraging.—\nArkanm* Democrat.\nColumbia State : Daughters of Confederate Gen\nerals who never had daughters are being constantly\nfeatured in northern papers. The wife of an humble,\nand doubtless respectable engineer, died recently in\nNew York and it was published that she was the\ndaughter of Gen. Braxton Bragg, that she was born\n"on the magnificent Bragg plantation in Newbern,\nN. C." Gen. Bragg had no daughter. He was a\nnative of North Carolina but his plantation, to\nwhich he retired from the United States army in\n1856, was located near Thibodaux, La., and after\nthe War Between the Sections he lived in Alabama,\nbeing chief engineer of that State. His brother,\nThomas, remained in North Carolina and was Gov\nernor of that State from 1854 to 1858; was United\nStates Senator when North Carolina seceded and\nfor two years was Attorney General of the Confed\neracy. He died in Raleigh in 1871; Gen. Bragg\ndied in Galveston, Texas, in 1876.\nA Good Life. —In the effort to appreciate various\nforms of greatness, let us not underestimate the\nvalue of a simply good life. Just to be good; to\nkeep life pure from degrading elements, to make it\nconstantly helpful in little ways to those who are\ntouched by it, to keep one\'s spirit always sweet,\nand avoid all manner of petty anger and irritability\n—that is an ideal as noble as it is difficult.—Edward\nHoward Griggs.\nColumbia State: Eighteen months ago many\nbelieved that when the czar loosed the Cos\nsacks and pointed out the Japs it would be a case\nof "eat \'em up Tige." The State dissented from\nthat opinion and has been vindicated, but when it\ncomes to charge a Socialist mob, with plenty of\nwomen and children mixed in with the men, the\nbearded fellows are invincible.\n" Southern industry can take care of itself," says\nthe Atlanta Constitution. "We see Postmaster\nGeneral Cortelyou has awarded a contract of\n$100,000 to the Dalton Furniture Company, of High\nPoint, N.

Admitted dishonesty in office is appar\nently no heinous offence in Wisconsin. .\nWHEN LABOR IMPROVES.\nProm the St. Louis Republic.]\nThe State of Louisiana covers 26,000,000 acres,\nand of this area about 19,000,000 acres are virtually\nvacant. Yet the portion of the Commonwealth\nwhich is in cultivation holds the record in the United\nStates for abundancy of production per acre. The\nState\'s population is at the low figure of thirty\ninhabitants to the square mile. This simple state\nment, without embellishment, would sufficice to\nT . . , . , ,, ,\nLouisianas prospects under the present\nimpetus of foreign and American immigration\nLouisiana has a railroad in nearly every parish,\nand transportation by water in every parish except\nfour. The Mississippi River forms the\'eastern State\nboundary as far south as Angola, and thence it\ncourses through the State to the extreme southern\nlimits at the Gulf of Mexico. Besides affording all\nthe facilities of water traffic, the river furnishes\nconveniences for irrigation in growing, rice. The\nsouthern partof the State faces the Gulf. Louisiana\nhas 1,250 miles of coast line.\nSatisfactory labor is hard to obtain, and negro\nlabor creates innumerable embarrassments, but the\nannual production of cotton exceeds 800,000 bales,\nand there are some ten cotton mills and some fifty\nfive cottonseed oil mills. Were labor conditions\nfavorable it is estimated that the cotton trade would\nbe at least twice as great. Cotton is grown exten\nsively in practically all sections, except the south\nern.\nSugar cane is raised in the central-southern and\nsoutheastern parts of the State. The sugar houses,\nabout 450, consume about 2,000 tons of cane daily.\nMore than fifty mills use the whole rice yield. Rice\nproduction could be doubled with little effort. The\ncapacity in this direction exceeds 1,500,000.\nThe lumber business of Louisiana has but just\nbegun to develop. The forest area comprises about\n17,000,000 acres. Pines predominate, but there are\noaks, hickories, ash, beech, magnolia, poplar,\n\' \' \' \' ® ,\ncypress, willow, gums and other woods. The op\nportunities for utilizing the forest resources are\nsuch as to admit of the establishment of various\nwoodworking industries in the tree regions.\nLouisiana oranges, strawberries, figs, plums,\npears and fruits of all kinds are celebrated. The\ngrowing of oranges and strawberries is steadily\nincreasing the revenues of the State. Tobacco is\ngrown in the northwestern section "\n. , , . , ,\nis augmenting marvelously in the central-eastern\n" nd central-western sections and cattle raising\nkee P s proportionate pace with agricultural interest\nand effort.\nThe largest sulphur mine and the largest salt\ndeposits in the United States are in Louisiana. Oil\nwells exist in the extreme southwestern corner, near\nthe Texas boundary. Marble beds, lignitic coal\nveins and iron ore constitute other special resources.\nThe chances for oyster growing are illustrated by\nthe fact that there are above 7,000 square miles of\noyster grounds capable of service.\nThe prosperity, development and prospects of\nLouisiana are well conveyed by the importance of\nits metropolis, New Orleans. Additional stempship\nlines to European ports, especially in the Southern\ncountries, tend to show that New Orleans has an\nexceptionally bright future. New Orleans already\nat\nin\nin\nTruck gardening\n!\nranks next to New York as an export city. With\nthe new steamship lines, and with the opening of\nthe Panama Canal, it is sure to become aggressive\nfor the first honor. New Orleans is now the largest\ngrain, the largest cotton, the largest sugar, the\nlargest rice and the largest lumber port of the U nited\nStates, as well as the largest foreign fruit market.\nBearing in mind that Louisiana is only about one\nthird developed, and that even against oppressive\nrestraints its prosperity is remarkable, there is a\nbasis for estimating, although incompletely, the\nopportunities which are offering and will be offered\nthrough long-desired facilities. The State\'s com\nmercial prospects are illimitable. Louisiana is one\nof the Southern States whose advancement to a\nhigh position among the world\'s trade centers is\ninevitable. It has the resources and the brains,\nand it requires only more and better labor.\nFROM OVER THE STATE.\nMrs. Nellie Powell suicided with laudnum at Mon\nroe last Thursday.\nEight clerks have been added to the postoffice\nforce in New Orleans.\nThere were no deaths at the Soldiers\' Home in\nNew Orleans during June.\nThe Civil Service Commission will hold examina\ntions at New Orleans August 1.\nAn unidentified white man was run over and\nkilled by a train at Monroe last Friday.\nThere are 1,500 teachers in attendance at the\neleven summer normals in session in Louisiana.\nLouisiana had $1,497,410.85 in the State Treasury\nat the beginning of the new fiscal year on July 1.\nAn orange grove of 11,000 bearing trees at Fort\nJackson was sold to Hon.

Since\nthe Earl of Balllncorne Is dead, child\nless, you are the rightful heir to that\nearldom. No, don\'t smile Incredulous\nthinking your old grandmother to\nwandering or In her second child\nhood, but listen to what I am about to\ntell you.\nI wish I could make you understand\nthe difference In this early part of the\nnineteenth century, when Mr. Stephen\nBon has succeeded in drawing coaches\nsteam, and the middle of the eight\neenth, when coaching was in its primo\nand we who rode had the excitement\nan occasional robbery. The high\nwayman was not the brute who now\nmurders first and robs afterward, but\nwas often chivalrous, especially to wo\nmen. When I was a girl of twenty I\ntraveled from London to York with my\nfather, and on the road we met one of\nthose gentlemen. We were passing a\nlonely part of the road In the dusk of\nthe evening when we heard an order\nthe coachman to stop. A masked\nman rode up to the coach window,\nholding a pistol in our faces and de\nmanding our valuables. His voice was\nsoft and musical, his hand was white\nand shapely, and I noticed the lace that\nfell over It was of the finest texture.\nMy father had but little money with\nhim, but did have a valuable snuffbox\nthat had been presented him by tbs\nking himself. He told the highway\nman that if he would send It to our\nhouse In York his messenger should re\nceive five times Its value and no.ques\ntions asked. The robber scarcely seem\ned to hear him, so intent was he upon\nme, not the wrinkled old woman of to\nday, but with as fair a skin, as blue\nan eye, as golden a head of hair as\nany girl in England.\n"Good sir," said the robber, "I would\nnot take your snuffbox but for the\nopportunity It gives me to take It to\nyour house myself, and if I decline the\nprice you put upon it please set the\nfact down to the influence of the young\nlady beside you, whose beauty and in\nnocence prevent my retaining any ar\nticle of yours. I have the honor, sir, to\nbid you a very good evening."\nRaising his hat with all the grace of\na courtier he turned away, directing\nthe coachman to drive on.\nThat winter was a gay one In our set\nIn town, and after attending numerous\nentertainments at the homes of our\nfriends we concluded to return the\ncivilities by giving a masked ball. Our\nhouse was lighted with a thousand\ncandles, and the costumes of the guests\nwere of the richest and wildest variety.\nOne of the gentlemen personated a\nhighwayman, wearing a brace of pis\ntols In his belt, with an ugly looking\nknife to match. He came np to me\nand asked me to dance. The moment\nhe spoke I recognized the man who had\nrobbed us on the road from London.\nI permitted him to lead me In the\nminuet He danced so gracefully, his\nfigure was so symmetrical, he was so\ncourtly In his manner that every one\nnoticed him. When the dance was\nfinished he led me away to a window\nwhere we stood partly screened behind\nthe curtains. Then he handed me my\nfather\'s snuffbox.\n"How did you dare come here? 1\nasked.\n"I would have dared anything to ses\nyou again," he replied.\n"Go at once," I said. "You will bs\ncaught. Every one has \'noticed you."\n"I would willingly bang for the pleas\nure I have gained in one dance with\nyou."\nDespite the danger he ran we talked\ntogether so contlnnously that we be\ngan to excite attention. A strange hap\npiness thrilled me. This fascinating\nhighwayman had caught tke fancy of a\nyoung girl naturally full of romance,\nand to know that he was risking his\nlife to be with me was supremely de\nlightful. I feared for him, but could\nnot bear to let him go. Finally I saw\nmy father coming toward us with flash\ning eyes. 1 knew by the way he look\ned at my companion that he had got\nsome clew to his identity. We vanish\ned In the crowd, slipped through a\ndoor Into the garden, and my highway\nman passed off the place In safety.\nLater, when my father found me, I\ngave him the snuffbox. He sent out\nto notify the police that the highway\nman was in town, but he was never\ncaught.\nOne spring morning I was sitting In\nthe garden In the rear of the house\nwhen above the wall I saw the bead\nof a man. I was about to scream when\nhe spoke. I recognized the voice of\nmy highwayman lover. He persuaded\nme to make au appointment with him\nin a wood near the city, and there we\nmet on several occasions. Hs confess\ned that he was the second son of a no\nMonurn who had taken to the roed\nfrom a keen love of adventure. He\nfinally persuaded me at one of our\nmeetings to go with him to a magis\ntrate and be married. I never returned\nto my home, but sailed to France with\nyour grandfather.\nDon\'t start, don\'t bend your head for\nshame, at learning that you have de\nscended from—I will not say a high\nwayman—a nobleman whose love for\nadventure blighted his life and made\nhim nn exile. My husband was belov\ned by all who knew him and worshiped\nby his wlfo and children. Even in\nthose youthful escapades he never ben\nefited by a shilling dishonestly, and\nmany a person whom he stopped on\nthe highway and found in need be\nhelped.\nThe Earl of Balllncorne, his brother,\ndying, the title and estates descended\nto his only son, who died childless\nyesterday. His death leaves you the\nnext in line.
