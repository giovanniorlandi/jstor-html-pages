BASKERVILL\nThe Times-News Bureau\nSir Walter Hotel\nRALEIGH, Jan. 5.—Within the\nnext few days, certainly within a\nweek. President Roosevelt is ex\npected to appoint some North\nCarolinian as director of recovery\nin North Carolina, at a salary of\nfrom $5,000 to $6,000 a year, it\nwas learned from official sources\nhere today. Members of the State\nlecovery board have already re\nceived a letter from the President\nthat this board would be abolished\nand that in its place a director cf\nrecovery would be appointed and\nan adbisory board, the members\nof this board to be selected large\nly from the personnel of the State\nand District recovery boards which\nit will supercede.\nIt will be the duty of this direc\ntor of recovery to enforce the va\nrious NRA codes in the state, see\nthat they are being observed, hear\ncomplaints and if necessary,\n"crack down" on the violators. In\nother words, the State director of\nrecovery will be a "little General\nJohnson" with powers in the state\nsimilar to the powers exercised\nover the nation as a whole by\nNRA Administrator Johnson. This\ndirector will hold almost dictato\nrial powers within the state as far\nas the enforcement of the NRA\ncodes are concerned. It is believed\nthat in many ways he will become\nthe most powerful federal appoin\ntee in the state. It is also agreed\nthat the job will be a very diffi\ncult and unpopular one and not\nlikely to better the political am\nbitions of whoever holds it.\nThis fact is naturally raising\nthe question of who will be ap\npointed to it—a politician or some\none who has not been active m\npolitics but who is recognized as\nhaving unusual executive ability,\nfirmness, fairness and the grit\nand capacity to hew to the line,\nregardless of political considera\ntions or of whose toes he may\ntread on in enforcing the NRA\ncodes. It is believed here that\nPresident Roosevelt will seek this\nlatter type.\nIt is currently reported here\nthat this post lias already been\ntentatively offered to C.

But the recov\nery is not expected to be enough\nto permit government income and\nexpenditures to balance each ntht-r\n\'in the fiscal year of 1934-85. In\n19.35-36 the President expects a\n| real balanced budget and after\nthat he believes it will he possible\nto begin paying off. out of cur\nrent receipts, a debt which by\nthen will stand at mountainous\nproportions.\nThe figures in the budget mes\nsage are startling.

The\npercentage of white home owners in the\nState i* 49.6 and the percentage of negro\nhome- owners is 2S.1 and the total pereeni\nage of home owners of both races in the\nState is 44.5. Henderson county is above\nthe State average in the three tables, as\nthe tntaf percentage of home owners in this\ncounty is 58.5.\nDr. S. H. Hobbs, Jr., gives this summary\nof conditions in the State with reference to\nhome ownership in the News Letter re\nferred to:\nThere are approximately six hundred and forty\nfour thousand families in North Carolina, town\nand country, white and negro, or .so in 1930. Less\nthan half of all families in the state lives in homes\nof their own, 44.5 pei cent to be exact. The re\nmaining 55.5 per cent are tenants. The homes in\nwhich they live are owned by someone else. I*i\nfact, many homes occupied by people classed as\nowners are not owned outright, but are encumbercd\nwith debt. Probably half of all homes occupied by\nowners are mortgaged or otherwise cncumber^-i\nwith deul. The exact ratio is not known. Hut it is\nprobable .that not more than one-fourth of all fam\nilies in North Carolina live in homes which they\nown outright.\nThere are nearly three hundred thousand rural\nfarm families in the state. By this is meant fami\nlies who live on farms outside of towns. Slightly\nless than half of these live in homes which they\nown. The exact ratio is 18.3 per cent. The widest\ndifference in home ownership by races is found in\nthis division of our population. For the rural farm\nfamilies 57.3 per cent of whites own their homes\nwhile for negroes the ratio is only 23.8 per cent.\nIt is in this group that the white home ownership\nratio is the highest and negro home ownership\nratio is the lowest.\nThere are approximately one hundred and eighty\nthousand urban families in the state. By urban 5o\nmeant places above twenty-five hundred inhabi\ntants. Of all families classed as urban. 37.4 per\ncent live in homes which they own. For the whiter\nthe ratio is 41.6 per cent, while for negroes the\nratio is 28.2 per cent. The white home ownership\nratio is lowest in the urban population, while the\nnegro home ownership ratio is somewhat hightr\nin the larger towns than on the farm.\nThere are neariy one nunureu anu\nthousand families in the state who live in towns\nbelow twenty-five hundred inhabitants, and outside\nthe corporate limits of towns and cities but who do\nnot live on farms. These are called the rural nor\nfarm population. Of all such families 41.3 per cent\nlive in homes which they own.\nNow here is an outstanding fact: the ratio of\nrural non-farm whites who own their homes is\n42.1 per cent, while the ratio for the negroes is\n38.8 per cent, or only slightly below the white\nratio. It appears that negroes have a better chant ?\nto rise into home ownership in the small towns and\nin the suburbs of towns and cities than either on\nfarms or in cities.\nFor the white population the highest ratio of\nhome ownership is on the farm. The ratios of hot<*c\nownership for urban whites and rural non-far.:i\nwhites are approximately the same. Possibly tiu\nmain reason why the white home ownership rati-"\nin our small towns and suburbs is not higher\nthat a large part of our textile industry is locator\nin small towns and textile mill villages. Not manj\ntextile mill families own their homes.\nn8r.e ctfbnty leads the state in per cent of a!\nfnnfetiM. wf o live in homes which they own. In th<\ncase the ratios for whites and negroes ar;\nalmost"-" e*Actfy the same.\nThe low^t ratio of home ownership in the stat<\ni? in Qi*l^}fL.50unty where only 22.1 per cent o\nall families, town and country, white and negro\nown theii*4t-">mes. Farm tenancy is the explanatioi\nfor Greene county as it is for many counties tha\nrank low in home ownership.\nOf the twenty-five counties that rnnk highest v.\nhoni«M>wnership ratios, all but one ars either in tli\nI mountain area or along: the coast.\nAll of the counties that rank low in home-own\nership ratios are either counties that have high\nratios of farm tenancy or counties with large ur\nban populations, or both. The low ratios in tho\nmain are found in the cash crop or farm tenant j\nbelt of the state. The city counties are well down\nthe list, but not at the bottom.\nThe low rank of Gaston is due to her textile\ndevelopment where few workers own their homes.\nIn fact Gaston county ranks last in per cent of\nwhite families who live in homes which they own,\nfollowed closely by Scotland and Greene, with\ntheir high farm tenant ratea.\nMitchell county, where there are very few ne\ngroes, leads in negro home ownership with eighty\nnine per cent of her negro families living in homes\nwhich they own. It appears that negroes find it\nvery difficult to rise into hocne ownership in Greene\ncounty where only 8.5 per cent of all negro fam\nilies live in homes of their own. Ratios are also\nvery low in Scotland, Edgecombe, Hoke, Wilson,\nPittfi Nash, Lenoir, Cleveland, and other cotton\nand tobacco counties. As a general rule the ratio\nof negro home ownership is inversely in propor\ni tion to the density of the negro population. Ir\nthose counties that have large negro ratios, rela\ntively few negroes rise into home ownership, either\non the farm or in town. The chances are better in\nthe city than on the farm, and muhc better in small\ntowns and suburbs than in any other environment;.\n(i - ■ »\nNEWSPAPERS\' OPINIONS\nBAR THE BAR!\n"\\*o matter what \'laws\' may be made to cripple\nthe beverage industries of our present times, they\ncannot, and will not, be observed by those manag\ning those industries, and the people, as a whole, I\nwill not interfere."\nThis interesting contribution to the literature of\nlaw and order was once made by the Brewers\'\nJournal. It Warned among its \'official appoint men\'s\'\nthe United States Brewers Association. To illumine\nits view of business it also said:\n"The producer and distributor, fn order to main\ntain the status of his respective industry, simply\ncould not observe the laws which would cripp! ?\nhim."\nSuch an indifference to law voiced in behalf of\nthe liquor traffic is one of those things hard to\nbelieve until\'one actually sees it. The quotations\nmay be found in the files of the Brewers\' Journal,\nMay 1, 1010. The date is old, the sentiment per\nsists.\nLiquor in fact seeks always to make its own\nlaw. Liquor bootlegged its way through the pro\nhibition era, tossed prohibition out of the window,\nand now is breaking over the feebler attempts to\nbind it again.\nChicago, for instance, lets the old barroom come\nback, but piously asks that the view of its interior\nbe kept unobstructed. Even that is too much for\nsaloon keepers, who soon start to screen and shut\nter the drinking as of old. Chicago also, with mo k «\nrigor, forbids liquor to be sold or given away from\n1 a. m. to 7 p. m. Whereupon at 4 a. m. a Chicago\nalderman, who is also a saloon keeper, shoots a\npoliceman who wants to join the party at his place.\nSome restraints of merit are being designed heie {\nand there for the business of liquor. The Chicago I\nshooting immediately led the Illinois senate to vote j\nthat mayors and aldermen should have no financial |\ninterest in its retail pale. One of the best checks !\nis the divorcing of the brewers from ownership or\ncontrol of saloon;:. The brewery saloon used to\nbe one of the worst. Its object was to push the\nsale of its master\'s beer; how. it has been often\ncharged. made no difference. As a curb on the\npolitical influence of liquor, campaign contributions\nby brewers, distillers and saloon keepers are for\nbidden in legislation introduced in some states.\nAll such are minor benefits. In systems of liquor\ncontrol, nothing short of barring the barroom is\ngoing to get down toward the roots of danger. The\nsaloon is a law to itself. The Brewers\' Journal let\nthe public in on the facts when it said the liquor\ntraffic would not observe the law. Of liquor\'s va\nrious offenders against the law, the saloon is the\nmost flagrant. When repeal was being urged, it\nwas promised that the saloon would not come bad*.\nAlso it was argued that respect for law would im\nprove. If America»really values respect for law, it\nshould see to it that the saloon doesn\'t come back.\n—The Christian Science Monitor.\nJAIL DRUNKEN DRIVERS\nThe swiftest means to cheek the appalling num\nbers of automobile accidents in North Carolina i.;\nto require every driver to submit to a rigid test of\nhis ability and his eyesight. Incontrovertable sta\ntistics show that accidents have waned in state*\nwhich require drivers licenses.\nRut in the meantime, while we are trying to .\nachieve this end, the problem of drunken drivers\nconfronts us with sickening force. Week-end acci\ndents, many of them serious, crowd the front\npages of our Monday papers, and on the police\nblotters, if you care to look, are scores of names\nbeside which is written "driving while drunk."\nCleveland\'s judge of the recorder\'s court has\nbeen giving $I>0 tines to drunken driveYs, and wo\nare happy to report that the fine is so heavy that\nmany of them, failing to pay it, have been jailed.\nWe strongly advocate jail sentences for all\ndrunken drivers.

All new construction\nwork is being carried out under\nthe public works program.\nGen. Brown\'s report for work\naccomplished covered the period\nfrom June 30. 1032 to June .">0.\n1933.

It\nwas a season, it held a mood.Avhich\nbelonged to Fifth Avenue, with its\nwell-dressed women, its alluring\ndisplays behind plate glass win\ndows.\nTheir little apartment, it Is true,\nwas a good long trek from the i\nAvenue—five long blocks, in fact,,\nbut Gypsy and Tom admired it,\nnone the less and felt smart and\nurlrn because they now belonged \'\nIn *\'ilie upper East Side" class. It\nwas the first home (Jypsy had ever\nknown, other than the shabby ,\nmansarded house In nine Hills.\nAnd it was so different In all re\nspects. so compact and shining and\nmodern.\nThey had decidcd against living\nIn a made-over "walk-up," as those\napartments w h i c h have been\nwrested from the interior of state\nly old brown-stone fronts are\ncalled in Manhattan. Both Gypsy \'\nand Tom were tired of old houses,\nor. thought they were, anyhow. The\nbig. square, cream-colored block of\napartments which they chose,\'\nwith its tiled lobby and self-steer\ning elevator, seemed the last word\nin comfort and convenience to\nfhem. That Is, it did until they\nfirst caught a glimpse of Lila\'s\npl*ce. I\'.ut I am getting ahead of\nmy story.\nTheir own particular cubbyhole\nconsisted of two rooms, a living\nroom and bedroom, and a kitchen\nand bath. Tho kitchen, in that\nquaint fashion known peculiarly to\nthe New York apartment dweller,\nopened directly on the entrance\nhall, and the upper half of the door\nwhich closed it off was made of\nfrosted glass. . This distressed\nGypsy mildly, but she numbered a\nhandsome Japanese screen, all coil\ning dragons and flying birds,\namong her wedding presents, and\nthis effectively hid the view from\nguests.\nTho whole placc was finished\npleasantly if uninspircdly In a\ncream-colored plaster, marked off\nby imitation paneling. Gypsy, used\nto the faded papers and liver col\nored paint of the house in nine\nHills, thought it very modish and\nrestful. She and Tom moved in on\nOctober first. tho last day of their\nvacation, and hung pictures,\npushed furniture about, and estab\nlished in their spick and span\nkitchen the treasures in tinware\nand glass which they triumphantly\nbrought homo from the ten-cent\nstore.\n"Isn\'t it perfect?" Gypsy, her\nhrown curls pushed back, a smudge\non her charming nose, her frock\n:ompletely hidden by a coverall of\nblue linen, demanded approval of\nher labors. The little room shone\nwith cleanliness and fresh paint\nand good will. The day-bed, up\nbolstered In green mohair, occupied\n:he longest wall space. There were\niwo Windsor chairs and a drop leaf\n:ab!e. There was an unpainted\nbookshelf. There were one or two\nnice black and white prints.

He couldn\'t\nbelieve in his luck, quite yet.\nThey picnicked in the kitchen\nthat evening, enjoying a scrambled\nmeal of canned beans and crisp\nbacon and salad. It was fun—it i\nwas all fun—from setting the table 1\nwith a checked cloth to washing {\nthe blue and white dishes.\n"You\'ll have to get some sort of j\npart-time maid," Tom told her.\nfirmly. "You can\'t work all day i\nwith those kids and come home to \'\nbeds and dishes."\n"We\'ll see about that," Gypsy\nsaid. But privately she was sure\nshe was equal to anything.
