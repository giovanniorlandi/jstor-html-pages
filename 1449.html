The components of Wharton‚Äôs jelly are similar to those of articular\ncartilage and it also contains some chondrogenic growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor I and transforming growth\nfactor-ùõΩ. We fabricated a tissue-engineered cartilage scaffold derived from Wharton‚Äôs jelly extracellular matrix (WJECM) and\ncompared it with a scaffold derived from articular cartilage ECM (ACECM) using freeze-drying.The results demonstrated that both\nWJECM and ACECM scaffolds possessed favorable pore sizes and porosities; moreover, they showed good water uptake ratios and\ncompressive moduli. Histological staining confirmed that the WJECM and ACECM scaffolds contained similar ECM. Moreover,\nboth scaffolds showed good cellular adherence, bioactivity, and biocompatibility. MTT and DNA content assessments confirmed\nthat the ACECM scaffold tended to be more beneficial for improving cell proliferation than the WJECM scaffold. However, RTqPCR\nresults demonstrated that the WJECM scaffold was more favorable to enhance cellular chondrogenesis than the ACECM\nscaffold, showing more collagen II and aggrecan mRNA expression.These results were confirmed indirectly by glycosaminoglycan\nand collagen content assessments and partially confirmed by histology and immunofluorescent staining. In conclusion, these results\nsuggest that a WJECM scaffold may be favorable for future cartilage tissue engineering.\n1. Introduction\nArticular cartilage, especially knee and hip hyaline cartilage,\nplays an important role in bearing stress and lubricating the\njoint [1]. It is easily damaged by trauma or overuse; moreover,\nself-healing is difficult after any injury because of its avascular\ncharacteristics [2‚Äì4]. Damaged cartilage can lead to joint\npain, swelling, and dysfunction, eventually causing degenerative\narthritis with no effective therapeutic strategy available\n[5]. Although some approaches for ameliorating cartilage\ninjuries have been attempted, these attempts often resulted\nin suboptimal outcomes. Three surgical techniques are currently\nused for repairing articular cartilage: microfracture\n(MF) repair, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI),\nand osteochondral autograft transfer (mosaicplasty) [6‚Äì8].\nHowever, while the newly formed tissue is fibrocartilaginous\nin terms of MF and ACI, it lacks the native cartilage collagen\nnetwork and is thus susceptible to failure [9‚Äì12].Mosaicplasty\nis usually appropriate for cases with damage involving the\nsubchondral bone. Unfortunately, there are limitations in\nHindawi\nBioMed Research International\nVolume 2017, Article ID 5839071, 12 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2017/5839071\n', '2 BioMed Research International\nobtaining sufficient autologous graft tissue to repair largearea\ncartilage injuries [13, 14].\nOver the past two decades, there has been increasing\ninterest in constructing a functional tissue-engineered cartilage\nas an alternative for cartilage regeneration [15, 16]. In\nparticular, the use of scaffolds derived from decellularized\ncartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) to construct tissueengineered\ncartilage has received a lot of attention [17‚Äì21].\nBecause decellularized cartilage ECM can preserve native\nbioactive proteins well, it provides a biomimetic microenvironment\nfor cell attachment, proliferation, and redifferen-\ntiation [21]. Hyaline cartilage is composed primarily of the\nproteoglycan aggrecan and collagen type II [22].\nThe umbilical cord includes one vein, two arteries, and\nthe surrounding myxomatous substance, which is referred\nto as Wharton‚Äôs jelly; it contains substantial amounts of\ncollagen, hyaluronic acid, and sulfated proteoglycans within\nits ECM components [23]. Wharton‚Äôs jelly ECM is similar\nto cartilage ECM; however, it is also rich in peptide growth\nfactors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), plateletderived\ngrowth factor (PDGF), a fibroblast growth factor\n(FGF), bFGF, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and transforming\ngrowth factor-ùõΩ (TGF-ùõΩ) [24, 25]. These peptide\ngrowth factors are conducive to the cellular biosynthesis of\ncollagen and glycosaminoglycans (sGAG), especially IGF-I\nand TGF-ùõΩ in chondrogenesis. Thus, Wharton‚Äôs jelly ECM\ncould be a good alternative biomaterial for tissue-engineered\ncartilage.\nGiven this background, we sought to compare the construction\nof tissue-engineered cartilage scaffolds usingWhar-\nton‚Äôs jelly ECM (WJECM) with that using articular cartilage\nECM (ACECM). We used a waterproof pulverization and\ndifferential centrifugation approach to obtain two different\ndecellularized ECMs and prepared 3D scaffolds by a freezedrying\nmethod. First, we compared the physicochemical\nproperties between the two scaffolds. Then, we constructed\ntissue-engineered cartilages by seeding rabbit chondrocytes\nand compared bioactivity and biocompatibility between\nthe scaffolds. Finally, we used biochemical and histological\napproaches to assess the tissue-engineered cartilages from\nqualitative and quantitative perspectives.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Preparation of ACECM and WJECM Scaffolds\n2.1.1. Pulverization and Decellularization of Human Umbilical\nCord. With approval by the Ethics Committee of the\nChinese PLA General Hospital and informed consent by the\npregnant women, fresh umbilical cord tissues (from fullterm\npregnancy healthy mothers aged 20‚Äì30 years) were\nobtained from the obstetrics department. Then they were\nimmersed in the electrolyzed oxidizing water (EOW), pH\n2.5, for initial sterilization for 10min, which was repeated\nthree times. Umbilical cord tissues were cut open from the\nmiddle under sterile conditions and then peeled off the outer\ntissue and vascular tissue. The remaining adhesive tissues\n(Wharton‚Äôs jelly) were rinsed with sterile distilled water for\n5min, and these procedures were repeated three times. They\nwere subsequently placed in 3%H2O2 for sterilization 30min\nand rinsed with sterile distilled water 30min, which was\nrepeated three times. The jelly was placed in a grinder,\nadding three volumes of sterile distilled water, and repeatedly\ncrushed them into a homogenate at ‚àí5‚àòC.Then, five volumes\nof sterile distilled water were added. The homogenate was\nfrozen at ‚àí20‚àòC and then thawed at room temperature. This\nfreeze-thaw cycle was repeated four or five times. Using\ndifferential centrifugation approach, the homogenate was\ncentrifuged in a centrifuge (Beckman Allegra X-22R, USA,\nF0850 rotor) for 30min at 3,000 rpm. Then the supernatant\nfluid was taken from the homogenate. Then supernatant\nfluid centrifuged for 30min at 5,000 rpm and separated again\nby gradient centrifugation for 30min at 7,000 rpm. Then it\nwas separated again by gradient centrifugation for 30min\nat 10,000 rpm. The final supernatant was discarded and the\nprecipitate was used as umbilical cord Wharton‚Äôs jelly ECM\n(WJECM).\n2.1.2. Pulverization and Decellularization of Cartilage. Cartilage\ntissues were cut from the fresh porcine knee joints,\nwhich were purchased from local market and then rinsed in\nsterile distilled water and washed three times. The cartilage\nwas immersed in the EOW (PH 2.5) for 10min, and this was\nrepeated three times. Under sterile conditions, the cartilage\nwas cut into slices, 1mm3 in size, and washed three times\nin sterile distilled water. They were immersed in 3% H2O2\nfor 40min disinfection and rinsed with sterile distilled\nwater four times. The cartilage particles were put into a\nhomogenizer; sterile distilled water was added at 4‚àòC; and\nit ground them repeatedly. The distilled water was mixed\nwith the sterile homogenate. The homogenate was frozen at\n‚àí20‚àòC and thawed at room temperature three times. Then,\nthe homogenate was subjected to gradient centrifugation at\n3,000 rpm for 30min (Beckman Allegra X-22R, USA, F0850\nrotor). The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again\nat 5,000 rpm for 30min. Then the supernatant was again\ncentrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 30min. Finally the homogenate\nwas centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30min. The supernatant\nwas removed and collected the deposits as articular cartilage\nECM (ACECM).\n2.2. Fabrication of ACECM and WJECM Scaffolds. The\nsuspensions of ACECM or WJECM were poured into the\ncylindrical molds, and the scaffolds were prepared by freezedrying\nmethod [26]. Briefly, the suspensions were first frozen\nat ‚àí20‚àòC for 2 h and then frozen to ‚àí80‚àòC for 1 h with\na constant cooling rate of 1‚àòC/min, lastly lyophilized for\n48 h in a freeze-dryer (Boyikang, Beijing, China). Then\nscaffolds were treated with carbodiimide solution (14mM\n1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride\n[EDAC] and 5.5mM N-hydroxysuccinimide [NHS];\nSigma) for 2 h at 4‚àòC for cross-linking [4, 27]. PBS solution\nwas used repeatedly to rinse out excess EDAC from the scaffolds.\nACECM- andWJECM-derived scaffoldswere prepared\napproximately 8mm in diameter and 2mm in thickness (Figure\n1). All the scaffolds were sterilized by 60Co ùõæ irradiation\n(5mrad).\n', 'BioMed Research International 3\nWJECMACECM\nFigure 1: Macroscopic view presenting the surface appearance of WJECM and ACECM scaffolds.\n2.3. The Comparison of Physicochemical Properties\nbetween the Two Scaffolds\n2.3.1. Microstructure. Scaffolds were cut into specimens of\n1mm thick cylinders to observe the general morphology\nand the interior microstructures by a sharp blade. After\nusing gold/palladium to coat the samples, scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) was used\nto examine the samples at 1 kV.\n2.3.2. Porosity. The ethanol intrusion methods were performed\nto measure the porosity. Firstly, add the anhydrous\nethanol in a graduated tube, and record the ethanol volume\nas ùëâ1. Then the scaffold was placed in for 5min,\nusing negative-pressure degassing to exhaust gases from\nethanol in the test tube until there was no air bladder\noverflow; we recorded the volume as ùëâ2. After taking out\nthe scaffold, we then read the remaining volume as ùëâ3.\nFor each scaffold group, three samples of the same size\nwere measured separately. The porosities of the scaffolds\nwere determined using the following formula: ùê∏ = (ùëâ3 ‚àí\nùëâ2)/(ùëâ3 ‚àí ùëâ1). Each type of scaffold was tested three times;\nthe average value was recorded as the final result for each\nscaffold.\n2.3.3. Scaffold Swelling Properties. Using the samples‚Äô wet\nweight (ùëöwet) followed by porogen leaching in triple-distilled\nwater and drying the scaffolds in vacuo to obtain the dry\nweight (ùëödry), we calculated the water absorption capacity\n(%). We used the following equation to calculate the swelling\nratio:\nSwelling ratio =\nùëöwet ‚àí ùëödry\nùëödry\n√ó 100. (1)\n2.3.4. Compressive Properties. A miniature material tester\nmodel (minimat 2000; Rheometric Scientific, Inc., Piscataway,\nNJ, USA) equipped with a 20N load cell was used to\nperform unconfined compression testing. Firstly, 1mm/min\ncross-head speed was used until a force reaching 20N. The\nelastic compressive modulus was calculated by the gradient\nof the first zone of linearity in the stress strain curve and\nthe compressive strength was measured at 30‚Äì50% strain in\nthe beginning of the plateau region. The initial compression\nthickness of the scaffolds (dry state) used in the above\nexperiments was all in 2mm.\n2.3.5. Comparison of Histological Characterization. The scaffolds\nwere cut by cryosection in 8 ùúám thickness, then fixed\nin acetone for 30min at room temperature (RT), and washed\nwith PBS. All specimens were stained with 0.1% toluidine\nblue, 1% safranin O, and type I and II collagen immunofluorescence\nstaining.\n2.4. The Construction of the Tissue-Engineered Cartilage\n2.4.1. Isolation and Expansion of Primary Rabbit Chondrocytes.\nWith approval by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese\nPLA General Hospital, articular cartilages were harvested\naseptically from the joint surfaces (shoulder joint and knee\njoint) of 2-month-old New Zealand White rabbits in PLA\nGeneral Hospital Medical Laboratory Animal Center. Using\na sterile technique, as described previously [11, 12], rabbits\nchondrocytes (RACs) were isolated and cultured. The cartilage\nwas diced into fragments< 1mm3.Theminced cartilages\nwere digested in regular culture medium containing 0.2%\ncollagenase type II (Sigma, USA) and transferred to an orbital\nshaker overnight at 37‚àòC. Then 0.75 √ó 106 cells were placed\nin tissue culture T-75 cm2 flasks (Corning, USA) at ‚àº25%\nconfluence in culture solution (DMEM containing glucose\nand glutamine, 15% FBS, 120U/ml penicillin, 120 kg/ml\nstreptomycin, 14mM HEPES, 0.2mM nonessential amino\nacids, 0.5mM proline, and 60mg/L ascorbic acid) (Sigma,\nUSA). After 1-2 weeks, cells in the T-75 flask approached\n100% confluence (P0) and were trypsinized using 0.25%\ntrypsin/EDTA (Gibco, USA) and then subcultured in T-75\nflasks at a density of 1 √ó 104 cells per cm2.The first subcultures\nwere labeled as passage 1 (P1) cells, and so forth. Mediumwas\nreplaced twice per week.\n2.4.2. Constructing of the Chondrocytes/Scaffolds Composites.\nAfter trypsin/EDTA treatment, RACs (P2) were collected in\na centrifuge tube and washed three times with Hank‚Äôs salt\nsolution. Then RACs were seeded into the sterile ACECM\nand WJECM scaffolds (8mm diameter, 2mm thickness).\nThe number of seeded cells was 1.0 √ó 106 for each ACECM\nor WJECM scaffold disk. The chondrocytes/scaffolds composites\nwere then placed in the 6-well culture plates and\n', '4 BioMed Research International\nincubated in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37‚àòC for\n30min to allow cell adherence.Then 3ml culture media were\nadded to each well and cultured for 7 and 14 days, changing\nthe culture solution every 3 days.\n2.5. Cellular Proliferation Assay. Cell proliferation in the\nACECM and WJECM scaffolds was assessed using the 3-[4,\n5-dimethyl(thiazol-2yl)-3,5-diphenyl]tetrazolium bromide\n(MTT) (Sigma) testing. Briefly, RACs (1 √ó 103 in a 300 ùúáL\nsuspension) were seeded in 96-well plates. After incubation\nwith control medium and pure concentrations of extracts for\n0‚Äì6 days, 20ùúáL of MTT solution was added to each well\nin new culture medium. After 6 h of further incubation at\n37‚àòC, the reaction liquid was removed from each well, and\n150 ùúáL of DMSOwas added to dissolve the formazan crystals.\nA microplate reader (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) was used at\n570 nm to measure the optical density. Three replicates were\nmade per sample.Themethod of preparing extracts from the\nscaffolds was described previously [28].\n2.6. Scanning Electron Microscopy Observation of Chondrocyte\nMorphology. SEM was used to observe the scaffolds‚Äô\nadhesion. At day 3, chondrocytes/scaffolds composites were\nremoved from the culturemedium, washed twice in PBS, and\nfixed for 24 h at 4‚àòC in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma, USA). A\nrange of 25, 50, 75, and 95% alcohol was used to dehydrate\nthe scaffolds and after it was treated with 100% alcohol for\n10min two times. Then the scaffolds were dried at RT. After\ngold palladium coating, the sections were observed by SEM\n(S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).\n2.7. Cell ViabilityAssessment. Cell viabilitywas assessed using\ncell live/dead assay kit (Sigma, USA) after 7 and 14 days (ùëõ =\n3 for each treatment) culture. The chondrocytes/scaffolds\ncomposites were washed twice in PBS and incubated in 5\n√ó 10‚àí3mg/ml fluorescein diacetate (FDA) 5min at RT in\nthe dark. Then, the FDA was aspirated and again washed\ntwice in PBS. The construct was incubated in another 5 √ó\n10‚àí3mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 5min at RT in the\ndark. PI was removed, and the construct was washed twice in\nPBS and examined by confocal microscopy (Olympus IX 81,\nJapan).\n2.8. Biochemical Analyses\n2.8.1. The DNA Quantification. The DNA content in each\nchondrocytes/scaffolds composites was measured by QuantiT\x02\nPicoGreen\x03 dsDNA assay (Invitrogen, USA) after 7 and\n14 days culture, according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.\nDNA concentrations per scaffold were calculated according\nto the DNA standard curve used the spectrofluorometer\n(BioTek, Winooski, USA). Three replicates were made per\nsample.\n2.8.2. The sGAG Quantification. The sGAG content each\nchondrocytes/scaffolds composites was measured by Tissue\nGAG Total Content DMMB Colorimetry Kit (Gen-\nMed Scientifics Inc., USA) after 7 and 14 days culture,\naccording to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. The total\nsGAG concentrations per scaffold were calculated according\nto the sGAG standard curve. Similarly, the sGAG content\nin various scaffolds without seeded chondrocytes was\nalso detected. And the pure sGAG concentrations secreted\nby the pure chondrocytes/scaffolds composites were calculated\nby total sGAG concentrations of pure chondro-\ncytes/scaffolds composites take out the sGAG content in\npure scaffold, respectively. Three replicates were made per\nsample.\n2.8.3. The Hydroxyproline Quantification. The collagen content\neach chondrocytes/scaffolds composites was measured\nby Hydroxyproline Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering\nInstitute, China) after 7 and 14 days of culture, according\nto the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. The total hydroxyproline\nconcentrations per scaffold were calculated according\nto the standard curve. Similarly, the hydroxyproline content\nin various scaffolds without seeded chondrocytes was\nalso detected. And the pure hydroxyproline concentrations\nsecreted by the pure chondrocytes/scaffolds composites were\ncalculated by total hydroxyproline concentrations of pure\nchondrocytes/scaffolds composites take out the hydroxyproline\ncontent in pure scaffold, respectively. Three replicates\nwere made per sample.\n2.9. RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR. RNA was extracted\nfrom chondrocytes/scaffolds composites by adding\nTRIzol (Life Technologies, USA). The cDNA was reversetranscribed\nusing ReverTra Ace\x03 qPCR RTMaster Mix (Toy-\nobo, Japan). 1 ùúál cDNAwere amplified in a 20ùúál PCRmixture\nincluding Platinum SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master MixPlus\n(Toyobo, Japan) and gene-specific primers (Parkson\nBeijing) (Table 1) in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs\ninstructions. The reaction comprised an initial denaturation\nfor 95‚àòC for 2min, 40 cycles with denaturing at 95‚àòC for 15 s,\nand annealing and extension at 55‚àòC for 15 s in each cycle,\nperformed using a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied\nBiosystems, USA).\nPrimer sequences were designed based on the published\ngene sequences (NCBI and PubMed). GAPDH was chosen\nas an endogenous control for the study. The relative gene\nexpression profiles of various samples were normalized to\nthe corresponding GAPDH and analyzed using the 2‚àíŒîŒîCT\napproach. Three replicates were made per sample.\n2.10. Histological and Immunofluorescence Analyses. The\nchondrocytes/scaffolds composites after 7 and 14 days in\nculture were cut by cryosection in 8 ùúám thickness, then\nfixed in acetone for 30min at room temperature (RT),\nand washed with PBS solution. On the one hand, some\nspecimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E),\n0.1% toluidine blue, and 1% safranin O; on the other hand,\nthe other samples were assessed by type I collagen (Abgent,\nUSA), type II collagen (Abgent, USA), and aggrecan (Novus,\nUSA) immunofluorescence staining. Secondary antibodies\n(Jackson, USA) and an Immunofluorescence Staining Kit\n(Vector Laboratories, UK) were used in accordance with the\nmanufacturer‚Äôs protocols.

Physicochemical Properties of ACECM and WJECM Scaffolds.\nThe scaffolds showed uniformly interconnected pore\nstructures, as observed by SEM (Figure 2). It could be seen\nthat there are nanofibrous ACECM and WJECM in the both\nvarious scaffolds. The ACECM scaffold had a mean pore size\nof 193.6¬± 62.1 ùúámandmean porosity of 75.7¬± 10.5% (Table 2).\nFor theWJECM scaffold, the mean pore diameter was 127.4 ¬±\n42.2 ùúám and the average porosity was 84.6 ¬± 3.2% (Table 2).\nThe mean pore size and porosity did not differ significantly\nbetween the scaffolds. However, the water uptake ratio of the\nACECM scaffold (31.1 ¬± 5.5) was much higher than that of\nthe WJECM scaffold (16.7 ¬± 2.3).

Discussion\nResearchers are currently focusing on cartilage tissue engineering\nbecause of the increasing incidence of articular\ncartilage injuries [29]. Some progress has been made in\nterms of cartilage regeneration [30‚Äì32]. The scaffold plays an\nimportant role in providing a suitable growth environment\nfor seeding cells and directing new tissue regeneration [33,\n34]. Decellularized articular cartilage ECM (ACECM) was\nthought to be the ideal biomaterial for tissue-engineered\ncartilage due to its biomimetic ECM composition and proteins\n[21]. Decellularized Wharton‚Äôs jelly ECM (WJECM)\nis not only similar to ACECM but also possesses some\nchondrogenic growth factors [22‚Äì24]. Our hypothesis was\nthat WJECM would be a good tissue-engineered cartilage\nbiomaterial, in comparison with ACECM.\nWe used a waterproof pulverization and differential\ncentrifugation approach to obtain twodifferent decellularized\nECMs and prepared two scaffolds with the constant cooling\nfreeze-drying method. On the one hand, the pulverization\nand centrifugation approach was beneficial to separate and\nobtain the ECM suspensions from the Wharton‚Äôs jelly or\ncartilage; on the other hand, the constant cooling technique\ncan be in favor of fabricating a uniform pore structure\nby forming uniform temperature distribution during the\nfreezing process as O‚ÄôBrien and colleagues have confirmed\n[26]. SEM images showed that both ACECM and WJECM\nscaffolds displayed a uniform porous sponge structure, which\nmay be beneficial for nutrient transportation and metabolic\nwaste exclusion. The mean pore sizes and porosities of the\ntwo scaffolds were comparable and showed no statistically\nsignificant difference. Both ACECM and WJECM scaffolds\nwere hydrophilic; however, the swelling ratio of ACECM\nwas larger than that of WJECM. We speculate that different\nECMcomponentmay lead to various swelling ratio; therefore\nACECM scaffold may have more absorbent materials than\nthat of the WJECM scaffold. The good hydrophilicity may\nenhance the biocompatibility of both scaffolds.\nIt is especially important for scaffolds with good biomechanical\nproperties to withstand normal human compres-\nsion forces when performing cartilage repair surgery. Thus,\nit is important to prepare cartilage scaffolds with favorable\nmechanical strength. The compressive modulus of the\nWJECM scaffold was higher than that of the ACECM\nscaffold. We concluded that the WJECM scaffold could resist\nmore powerful compressive stimulation than the ACECM\nscaffold. Histological staining further confirmed that the\nWJECM and ACECM scaffolds contained similar components\nof sGAG, collagen I, and collagen II, mimicking\n', '10 BioMed Research International\nWJECMACECM WJECMACECM\nHE\nAGG\nT B COL I\nS O\nCOL II\n7 days\n14 days\n7 days\n14 days\n7 days\n14 days\nFigure 9: Histological and immunofluorescent staining of chondrocytes cultured on WJECM and ACECM scaffolds 7 and 14 days after\nseeding (scale bar = 200 ùúám). H&E staining showed that the cells were distributed evenly and secreted ECM in both of the scaffolds. Safranin\nO and toluidine blue staining showed that chondrocytes in the WJECM scaffold showed more intense staining than those in the ACECM\nscaffold at 7 or 14 days. At 7 and 14 days, both scaffolds were positive for collagen I, collagen II, and aggrecan.\nnative cartilage ECM. The WJECM scaffold may provide\na biomimetic environment for seed cell proliferation and\nredifferentiation.\nThe biocompatibility of the scaffold plays a key role\nin tissue regeneration and functional reconstruction. The\nresults of the SEM assessment showed that both ACECM and\nWJECM scaffolds had good cell adherence at 3 days after\nseeding. We suggest that the favorable attachment may be\nassociated with the collagen components in both scaffolds\nbecause collagen enhances cellular adhesion. TheMTT assay\nand cell viability test demonstrated that the cells adhered\non both scaffolds and proliferated rapidly with time. The\nincreased chondrocyte number and viability on both scaffolds\nsuggested that both scaffolds had good cell affinity and could\nmimic the native cartilage ECM microenvironment for cell\nadhesion and proliferation.\n', 'BioMed Research International 11\nBoth ACECM and WJECM scaffolds were rich in sGAG\nand collagens;moreover, theWJECMcontainedmore growth\nfactors than the ACECM, such as IGF-I and TGF-ùõΩ, which\nwould be highly conducive to seed cell chondrogenesis [24].\nThis is an important point because favorable scaffolds can\nimprove the formation of tissue-engineered cartilage. RTqPCR\nconfirmed that the WJECM groups showed more\ncollagen II and aggrecanmRNAexpression.Theupregulation\nof collagen II may be related to the higher Sox-9 mRNA\nexpression in the WJECM group because Sox-9 can upregulate\ncollagen II expression by specifically combining with\nan enhancer element [35, 36]. Moreover, collagen and sGAG\nquantitative tests further confirmed the RT-qPCR results,\ndemonstrating more collagen and sGAG production in the\nWJECM group. Safranin O and toluidine blue staining was\nmore intense in the WJECM group than in the ACECM\ngroup. However, the immunofluorescent staining showed no\nsignificant difference, although this may have been due to\ninsufficient culture time.\nThe DNA contents in the groups reflect cell numbers in\nthe scaffolds; the resultswere consistentwith theMTT results,\nshowing more cell proliferation in the ACECM group than\nin the WJECM group. We suggest that the growth factors in\nthe WJECM scaffold may enhance cellular chondrogenesis\nmore than proliferation. Collagen I gene expression was\ninitially upregulated and then decreased in both groups,\nwhile expression in the WJECM group was ultimately lower\nthan in the ACECM group. This was consistent with the\ncellular chondrogenesis results. Collagen X gene expression\nis associated with osteogenic differentiation [37, 38]. Gene\nexpression of collagen X was upregulated in both groups;\nit was ultimately higher in the WJECM group than in the\nACECM group.\nThis investigation has some limitations. First, it may be\nnecessary to extend the culture times to induce chondrocyte\nchondrogenesis because we did not obtain lacuna structures\nin the cells. Second, we may need to examine different\ncomponents specifically between WJECM and ACECM,\nespecially in terms of growth factors, to explain further\nthe chondrogenesis mechanism in the two ECMs. Finally,\nalthough WJECM can upregulate the expression of some\nchondrogenic markers, to avoid osteogenic differentiation,\nwe may attempt to set up chondrogenic culture conditions\nthat decrease collagen X expression.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we prepared WJECM scaffolds using a waterproof\npulverization and differential centrifugation approach\nwith the freeze-drying method. The WJECM scaffolds\nshowed favorable bioactivity and biocompatibility characteristics.\nIn conclusion, WJECM scaffolds may be valuable for\napplications in cartilage tissue engineering.\nEthical Approval\nThis study was approved by our institutional review board.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nAuthors‚Äô Contributions\nTongguang Xiao andWeimin Guo contributed equally to this\nwork.
