The medium-high mountain ranges of Western Europe are undergoing rapid socio-environmental\nchanges. The aim of this study is to show that their landscape can be strongly shaped by the\nactions of avalanche activity, humans and climate. The study area is the Rothenbachkopf-Rainkopf\ncomplex, a site representative of avalanche-prone areas of the Vosges Mountains (France). A geo-historical\napproach documents regular avalanche activity over more than 200 years on 13 paths. A diachronic\nanalysis of historical maps and photographs demonstrates substantial afforestation (from 60 to 80% of\nthe total surface since 1832). LIDAR data and field surveys highlight the existence of a longitudinal\nand transversal structure of trees. Hence, the avalanche, human and climate activity footprints are\nretained by the landscape, which rapidly adapts to these changing drivers. Specifically, the pattern of\ntree species and heights results from a near equilibrium with regular avalanche activity sometimes disturbed\nby major avalanches that induce quasi-cyclic changes in the landscape mosaic. The afforestation\ntrend is attributable to profound changes in silvo-pastoral practices, supplemented by the impact of\nclimate change. The wider relevance of the results in relation to the local context is discussed, as well\nas outlooks that can refine our understanding of this complex system.\nKEYWORDS: avalanches, climate change, geomorphology\nINTRODUCTION\nIn mountain areas, forests are structured by multiple factors.\nCertain of these are internal such as soil type, slope, etc.,\nwhereas others exert external pressures: prevailing climatic\nconditions, forest logging, etc. The patterns of individual\ntrees, forest species and forest stands contribute to the landscape\nmosaic on the slopes, which is not stationary over\ntime: frequent changes occur in response to changes in\nhuman activities and/or climate. Under favourable conditions,\nsnow avalanches or other natural hazards (Benda\nand others, 1998; Schumacher and Bugmann, 2006;\nGarcía-Aguirre and others, 2012) generate disturbances\nwhich are visible from the level of individual trees to the\nscale of entire forest stands (Walsh and others, 2004;\nSimonson and others, 2008; Teich and others, 2012; Feistl\nand others, 2014). As a consequence, avalanche activity\nand its variation over time may also contribute to landscape\ngenesis (Malanson and Butler, 1986; Walsh and others,\n1994). Hence, the landscape dynamics of a forest slope subjected\nto avalanches result from the integration over time of\nthe multiple human, climatic and avalanche activity drivers\nthat affected the forest stands during their history. These\ndynamics are particularly complex, and the visual aspect of\nthe slopes is highly variable over time.\nIn the literature, the concept of medium-high mountains\nrefers to either an altitudinal stage of high mountain environments\nor a full topographic entity of modest elevation\n(Rieutort, 1997). This paper refers to the second meaning of\nthe term. Medium-high mountain ranges are often contrasted\nto high-altitude mountain ranges in terms of altitude, topography\n(old versus young mountains, rounded tops versus\nrugged peaks, etc.), natural processes (seasonal snow cover\nonly versus glaciers) or practices (everyday living space\nversus marked seasonal rhythm associated with tourism).\nTheir highest elevations are covered by mountainous to subalpine\nvegetation. They remain preserved wilderness areas\nbut have also been everyday living spaces for centuries,\nand therefore, possess a rich cultural heritage (Sgard,\n2007). In France, this corresponds to the Jura, the Massif\nCentral and the Vosges Mountains whose elevation ranges\nAnnals of Glaciology 59(77) 2018 doi: 10.1017/aog.2018.26 111\n© The Author(s) 2018.

(Rieutort, 1997). In Europe,\nidentification of such massifs may be more complex. It is\nclear, for example, for the Swiss Jura or for Sudetenland\n(Czech Republic), but such identification is sometimes not\neasy, for example, for the Carpathians. These are the\neastern termination of the alpine arc, but their topography\nand vegetation cover are close to those of medium-high\nmountains, as we have defined them. Also, a large proportion\nof the Scandinavian and Russian mountains (Norwegian\nfjords, Kola Peninsula, etc.) and the Scottish Highlands are\nvery similar to our topographical criteria but are characterised\nby alpine vegetation because of a harsher climate\nand they are not densely populated. Yet, all in all, mediumhigh\nmountain ranges as we understand them, exist in\nmany parts of the world: the northeastern USA, Quebec, northern\nJapan, etc., but it may be fair to say that, apart from\nexceptions (e.g. Hétu and others, 2015), they have been\noverlooked in the scientific literature compared with high\nmountain ranges (Andes Cordillera, Rocky Mountains,\nEuropean Alps, etc.), especially in terms of studies concerning\nsnow and avalanches.\nHowever, in medium-high mountain ranges affected by a\ntemperate climate, relations and interactions between\nhuman societies, climate and avalanches are particularly\nstrong. Indeed, medium-high mountain ranges are by definition\nat rather low altitudes (<2000 m a.s.l.). Their avalanche\npaths are, therefore, often forested up to the release areas,\nand visible marks of avalanche flows (scars, stem morphology,\nthe structure of the stands, specific diversity, etc.)\ncan be found over a wide range of elevations with regard\nto the elevation of the summits. This situation is less frequent\nin alpine environments where large proportions of avalanche\npaths are normally located above the treeline. Moreover, in\nmedium-high mountain ranges, especially in those located\nin Western and Central Europe, human societies have been\npresent for millennia. Hence, forest ecosystems have long\nbeen under pressure by agro-silvo-pastoral, proto-industrial\nand/or industrial activities. The magnitude of this pressure\nwas variable, depending on the demographic, socio-economic\nand political contexts, but remained strong overall.\nThe landscape, and especially the presence of forest cover\nand the characteristics of the stands (species, size of trees,\nforest density, etc.), has therefore undergone profound and\nrapid fluctuations during the past centuries. These land\ncover changes may have had consequences on avalanche\nactivity, but devoted studies remain rare to date and often\ninconclusive due to a lack of reliable long-range avalanche\ndata. As a counter-example, García-Hernández and others\n(2017) showed how reforestation since the late 19th\ncentury has drastically reduced avalanche damage in the\nAsturian massif (Spain). Finally, because of their reduced altitudinal\nrange that coincides with the fluctuation zone of the\nzero-degree isotherm during the winter season, temperate\nmedium-high mountain ranges are particularly sensitive to\nglobal warming, with its joint effects on winter snowfall, avalanche\nfrequency/intensity, as well as on forest ecosystems\n(Beniston and others, 2018).\nIn the literature, landscape organisation by avalanche\nactivity has been most studied in North America (Patten\nand Knight, 1986, 1994; McClung, 2003) and/or in typical\nhigh-altitude mountain ranges (Viglietti and others, 2010;\nAnderson and McClung, 2012) where avalanche–forest\ninteractions often remain limited to relatively reduced parts\nof the whole flow paths and where human influence on the\nenvironment has remained limited so far. Also, much of\nthis work was done decades ago (Heath, 1960; Schaerer\nand others, 1973; Burrows and Burrows, 1976; Luckman,\n1977; Butler, 1979; Butler and Malanson, 1985; Johnson,\n1987; Butler and Walsh, 1990; Walsh and others, 1990,\n1994). Remote sensing and signal processing tools that can\naccurately evaluate area-wide statistics to sum up landscape\npatterns were absent at this time. In more recent studies, the\nfocus was often on forest stand adaption to avalanches\n(Kulakowski and others, 2006, 2011; Voiculescu and\nArdelean, 2012), which involved refined analysis of ecological\nprocesses at play, but was not conducted at the\nscale of a whole forest slope due to the amount of refined\nfieldwork required (e.g. Schönenberger and others, 2005).\nAlternatively, in different studies, forest landscape patterns\nand their changes at specific dates were obtained as a byproduct\nof tree-ring reconstructions of past avalanche activity\n(e.g., Decaulne and others, 2014; Šilhán and Tichavský,\n2017; Favillier and others, 2018; Krause and K\x01rížek, 2018).\nBy contrast, studies specifically addressing the secular evolution\nof forest landscapes affected by avalanche activity\nremain rare (Baker, 1992), and those considering avalanches,\nhuman pressure and climate together as potential drivers\nnearly absent (Kulakowski and others, 2016).\nOn this basis, the objective of this paper is to highlight,\nusing a combination of state-of-the-art tools and methods\nthat the forest landscape of temperate medium-high\nmountain ranges of Western Europe can be strongly shaped\nby the action of climate, human activity and avalanche\nactivity. Hence, the main target of the paper is not\navalanches and the forest’s response to climate and\nanthropogenic pressure changes. Instead, we aim at characterising\nand explaining the current state and the evolution\nover the last two and a half centuries of a complex forest\nlandscape at the scale of a mountain slope as it can be visually\ngrasped in the field. The study is conducted in the Vosges\nMountains where secular human–nature relations have\nexisted, as in many medium-high mountain ranges of\nWestern Europe (Boyé, 1903; Dion, 1985). Specifically, the\ncase study is the Rothenbachkopf-Rainkopf complex, a site\nrepresentative of avalanche-prone areas in the Vosges\nMountains.\nIn accordance with the scope of this study, we concentrate\non data and forest metrics directly visible on ground photos,\naerial photographs and/or maps, that can be evaluated\nthroughout the study area from the data at hand. These\nmetrics are forest extent, forest canopy height and tree\nspecies composition. For the current landscape, they are\nevaluated from field observations (a large sample of trees),\nairborne laser data and related processing techniques. The\nlong-range evolution focuses on changes in the forest\nextent as a function of time inferred from a large set of\nmaps and aerial photographs. Aerial photographs have an\noptimal resolution, but have been available over the last\nfew decades only, whereas historical maps have a coarser\nresolution but are available for the entire study period.\nFinally, constructed on the Giacona and others (2017a, b)\ninventory, refined geo-historical analyses are used to map avalanche\nactivity in the Rothenbachkopf-Rainkopf complex and\nits interaction over time with human activities and forests.\nThese include exploitation of various sources of historical\narchives, topographic surveys and field identification of\nvisible marks of avalanche activity in tree stands. This extensive\ncombination of data and methods has proved useful to\n112 Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'understand that snow avalanches, climate and human influence\nall play a role in the landscape genesis. Hence, in\nwhat follows we show (i) that the current landscape retains\nthe footprint of the actions of these three factors and (ii) that\ntheir evolution has been integrated into the rapid and significant\nchanges in the forest mosaic over the past two centuries.\nVOSGES MOUNTAINS AND STUDY AREA\nPhysical context of the Vosges Mountains\nThe Vosges Mountains are located in the north-east of\nFrance; they are ∼150 km long and vary in width from 20\nto 60 km (Fig. 1a). The main ridge, oriented north-northeast/south-south-west\nis composed of a chain of convex\npeaks culminating at 1300–1400 m a.s.l. It is the first orographic\nbarrier encountered by atmospheric flows coming\nfrom the Atlantic, and it stands perpendicular to the direction\nof prevailing winds. These winds sweep and blow the snow\nfrom the flat and forest-free summits to form cornices (up to\nseveral meters) and wind slabs at the top of the eastern\nslopes, which are marked by a sudden slope rupture (Wahl\nand others, 2007). The southern part of the Vosges\nMountains still has visible marks of the quaternary ice age\nincluding glacial valleys, glacial cirques, moraine deposits\nand slopes >30° (Flageollet, 2003).\nBecause of their latitude and altitude, the climate of the\nVosges Mountains is cold and wet, with precipitation\nthroughout the year (climate Cfb according to the KöppenGeiger\nclassification). Average annual rainfall varies\nbetween 900 and over 2000 mm (Drogue and others,\n2006). The coefficient of nivosity is 20, 30 and 60%, at\n700, 1000 and 1350 m a.s.l., respectively, and the average\nannual temperature drops from 9 to 4°C between 350 and\n1400 m a.s.l. (Wahl and others, 2009). More than 150 frost\ndays are recorded on the summits and snow cover may\npersist, in the form of firn, until early summer in the glacial\ncirques on the eastern slopes. Due to these climatic conditions,\nnumerous avalanches are recorded every year in the\nVosges Mountains (Giacona and others, 2017a). They\noccur mainly on the steeper eastern slopes and are often\nreleased by the breakage of cornices.\nThese climatic characteristics combined with topography\ninduce a theoretical organisation of vegetation in three\nstages. The Collinean vegetation zone exists up to 400–\n600 m a.s.l. and is mainly dominated by beech and oak.\nThe mountainous zone is characterised by mixed stands of\nbeech and fir, often accompanied by spruce. Above 1000–\n1100 m a.s.l., the subalpine belt is characterised by lowproductivity\nopen forest stands dominated by beeches with\ntwisted and gnarled trunks, as well as summit meadows,\nthe Hautes Chaumes. From paleo-environmental investigations\n(pedoanthracology), Goepp (2007) has postulated that\nthe Hautes Chaumes were deforested by anthropogenic\nactions (fires) already during protohistory and that the\nhighest peak of the Vosges Massif (1424 m a.s.l.) is now\nbelow the theoretical tree line. However, since the natural\ntree line is far from being stationary depending on climate\nand because of the very long and complex history of\nhuman activities in the Vosges Mountains (see the section\n‘Societal context and landscape evolution in the Vosges\nMountains’), this is difficult to establish with certainty.\nThe climate context of the study period expands from the\nlast few decades of the Little Ice Age (LIA, Grove, 1988) at the\nbeginning of the 19th century to the current rapid warming of\nanthropic origin clearly perceptible since ∼1985. Multiproxy\nregion-wide (Pfister, 1992; Glaser and Riemann, 2009) or\ngridded reconstructions (Casty and others, 2007) exist,\nwhich can be supplemented by a few instrumental series of\nmeteorological observations (Miná\x01rová, 2013). This makes\nit possible to quantify the regional trends having prevailed\nin annual temperature and precipitation. Sources mostly\nagree that warming over the study period has been irregular,\nbut very significant over the study period. The study area has\nalso evolved towards a slightly wetter climate (Appendix A).\nHow these major trends in temperature and precipitation\nhave affected snow amounts in the inner Vosges Mountains\nremains difficult to evaluate precisely due to a lack of continuous\nrecords throughout the study period. However, the\nfew observations and statistical results existing highlight\nthat the characteristics of the snowpack were clearly strongly\nimpacted. Observations made on the Hautes Chaumes at the\nheart of the coldest decades of the 19th century (Collomb,\n1848; Grad, 1871) document the persistence of snow\npatches throughout the year at that time, which has no\nlonger occurred over the recent decades (Wahl and others,\n2009). More systematically, Flageolet (2005) compiled and\nprocessed available snow records, highlighting marked\ndrops in the number of snow days, cumulated snowfall and\nsnow-cover duration. He evaluated the decrease at 40–\n60% over the 1970–2000 period at the lowest measurement\nstations in the Vosges Mountains (>600 m a.s.l.), whereas,\nfor the highest stations, the decrease over the same period\nwas less (e.g. −16% snow days and cumulated snowfall for\nthe Champ du Feu station, ∼1100 m a.s.l.).\nSocietal context and landscape evolution in the Vosges\nMountains\nHarsh conditions, especially during the LIA, did not preclude\nfrom the establishment of human activities, at least seasonal,\nwhich has left strong footprints since the Middle Ages (Léser,\n1995; Kammerer, 2003; Garnier, 2004). The Vosges\nMountains contain resources that have already been developed\nby proto-industrial activities such as sawmills, glass-\nworks, mines, forges and the metallurgical industry (Jéhin,\n1993; Garnier, 1998, 2004). Concomitantly, local mountain\nsocieties were known for their agro-pastoralism, in which\nlivestock held a prominent place as the main source of\nwealth. Mountain farming has two periods: summering in\nmountain farms, between the end of May and the end of\nSeptember, and wintering in the valley during the rest of\nthe year. All these activities strongly shaped the Vosges\nMountains landscape over the centuries, particularly\nthrough the pressure exerted on the wood resource and\nbecause of grazing needs. Hence, at the scale of the entire\nVosges Mountains, demography, prosperity and forest stand\nchanges are strongly related. Significant clearings occurred\nduring the demographic expansion in the 16th century. In\ncontrast, because of a population decrease linked to war episodes,\nreforestation occurred in the 17th century.\nDemographic growth in the 18th century and the renewed\ndevelopment of the Vosges Mountains led to a peak in deforestation\nat the end of the 18th century. The clearing was\nrelated to the needs of mountain dwellers for arable land,\npastures, handicrafts, timber and firewood (Dion, 1985;\nGarnier, 2004). Also, at least until the 19th century, protoindustrial\nsettlements were large wood consumers (Jéhin,\n113Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', '1993, 2010; Garnier, 2004). Finally, as a construction material\nand fuel, the forests contributed to the war effort until the\nend of the 18th century (Garnier, 2004). All in all, it is important\nto note that, since the beginning of its exploitation, the\nforest of the VosgesMountains has gone through different successive\nphases of deforestation and reforestation in relation to\nhighly varying human pressure, which makes the retrieval of\nits hypothetical ‘initial natural state’ almost impossible.\nHowever, over the last two centuries, the situation has\nbeen somewhat simpler. At the scale of the entire Vosges\nMountains, forest cover spread both in valley bottoms and\nmountains (altitude meadows and glacial cirques).\nAlthough this afforestation has accelerated since the 1950s,\nthe process started to become effective at the end of the\n19th century, due to the extinction of proto-industrial activities,\nagriculture abandonment, the rural exodus and a suc-\ncession of reforestation policies. The latter started in 1801,\nthen continued throughout the 19th century and was still\neffective in the middle of the 20th century (Departmental\nArchives of the Haut Rhin department, 7P 48; Brun, 1978;\nKoerner, 2000; Blanc, 2003). Specifically, agricultural abandonment,\nrural exodus and the development of the textile\nindustry (Garnier, 1998) caused a marked decline of the pastoral\npressure from the second half of the 19th century and\neven more during the 20th century. Some mountain farms\ndid merge, others (and with them the meadows) simply\nFig. 1.

At least one\nevent could be retrieved in historical sources for each of the ten certain paths. For the three probable paths, only visible marks of\navalanche activity were identified in the field, but no mention of past events was found in historical sources. Intensity levels allow rating\nindividual avalanche events on the scale provided by Giacona and others (2017a, b) introduced in the text.\n114 Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'disappeared, which left many ruins after both world wars.\nSummer cattle were estimated at 4000 cows in the Hautes\nChaumes in 1917. It had decreased to 1600 in 1931\n(Marthelot, 1952). After WWII, this trend continued, with\nthe number of farms dropping by 40% between 1955 and\n1970, whereas the agricultural population was halved,\ncausing gradual afforestation of abandoned plots.\nAvalanche–forest interactions in the Vosges\nMountains and the study area\nThe biophysical and social characteristics of the Vosges\nMountains result in significant avalanche activity (Giacona\nand others, 2017a, b), which interacts with the forest cover\nas well as the climatic and social context in a strong but\ncomplex manner. For instance, afforestation, warming and\nthe subsequent reduction of snow amounts mentioned\nabove led to the disappearance of avalanches in some\nlowland areas (<600 m. a.s.l.). Indeed, the historical\nenquiry of Giacona and others (2017b) was not able to identify\nsources relating recent avalanches in certain low-altitude\nlocations of the Vosges Mountains where avalanches were,\nby contrast, documented during the coldest decades of the\n19th century. Field visits confirmed the absence of any\nvisible marks of avalanche activity on these sites (only\nmature forest stands without any visible perturbations were\nobserved). On the other hand, maintenance of pastoral activity\non the summit meadows limits the forest colonisation of\nareas, which should be, according to Goepp (2007), under\nthe theoretical treeline. This allows the snow to be blown\nby wind up to cornices, which would favour the persistence\nof a sustained avalanche activity on the eastern slopes\n(Giacona and others, 2017b).\nThe Rothenbachkopf-Rainkopf glacial cirque (1316 m a.s.l.\nat the Rothenbachkopf summit, 1.7 km2, Fig. 1c) is an ideal\ncase study to analyse these complex processes and to highlight\ntheir impacts on landscape dynamics. It has indeed sustained\navalanche activity mainly due to the formation of cornices\nsouth of the Rainkopf, and east from the ridge linking the\nRainkopf and Rothenbachkopf summits (Table 1). It must be\nstressed at this stage that at the scale of the entire Vosges\nmountain range, phases of deforestation and afforestation\nare relatively well known (Garnier, 2004). However, at a\nmuch more local scale such as in our study area, this regional\ntrend may not necessarily apply. Local logging pressure may\nindeed have been at some time very different from what\nprevailed at the regional scale at the same time.\nReconstruction of the forest cover evolution in the study\narea over the study period from historical maps and photographs\nwas chosen as a means to overcome this difficulty as\nmuch as possible.\nDATA AND METHODS\nGeo-historical analyses\nIn France, systematic surveys of avalanches in medium-high\nmountain ranges do not exist. Giacona and others (2017b)\nobtained a geo-chronology of avalanches for the Vosges\nMountains by combining archives, oral memory, media articles,\nvarious memorial markers and photographs and histor-\nical postcards (Fig. 2). This information made it possible to\nidentify 730 avalanches between 1783 and 2014. In\nGiacona and others (2017b), when possible, avalanches\nwere classified according to their intensity (from 1, very\nlow, to 5, exceptional intensity). A specific intensity scale\nwas used, primarily related to the runout distance. It is\nadapted to the physical characteristics of the Vosges\nMountains so as to reflect the variability of avalanche activity\nin the study area. Specifically, an avalanche starting from the\nmain ridge and flowing down to the valley bottom is, in the\nVosges Mountains, a remarkable avalanche likely to have\nsignificant consequences, which warrants a level 5 notation.\nSecond, in Giacona and others (2017b) avalanches causing\ndamage were highlighted. Events recorded up to the mid20th\ncentury were almost exclusively damaging avalanches\nwhich caused deaths, damaged or destroyed buildings and/\nor destroyed large portions of the forest stands.\nThe specific study reported herein is based on the 60 avalanches\nthat occurred in the study area and are part of this\nrecord (see the section ‘Avalanche activity and related\ndamage’). For this study, within the study area, numerous\nspecific field visits were conducted to locate the corresponding\navalanche paths as precisely as possible. This was done\nusing an in-depth investigation of historical sources referring\nto observed events coupled with expert analysis of the topography\n(notably, identification of potential release areas on the\nbasis of standard topographical thresholds, Maggioni and\nGruber, 2003), and identification of visible disturbances\ncaused by interactions between avalanche activity and\ntrees. More specifically, the presence/absence of forests,\nthe spatial distribution of species, tree heights and stem\nTable 1.

Topographical characteristics of the study area have been computed from the 1 m resolution\nLIDAR-based DEM.\n115Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'morphologies (multiple leaders, decapitation, scars, etc.)\nwere used as indicators to map avalanche-prone areas\n(Stoffel and Bollschweiler, 2008; Stoffel and Corona, 2014).\nThis all made it possible to determine potential release\nareas and the main flow paths throughout the study area,\nand to precisely position intensity thresholds (i.e. the position\nwithin the path whose exceedance included the avalanche in\na given intensity class). Note that other natural disturbances\nare truly extremely limited in the study zone. A limited rockfall\nactivity exists on the northern slopes, but its role in\nshaping the landscape can be considered as rather negligible.\nAs a consequence, even if a few scars or specific\nstems that were met on the field were potentially attributable\nto rockfall events instead of avalanche events, this did not\npreclude identifying avalanche-prone areas.\nTo further assess the species composition of the forest\nstructure, 1833 trees were pseudo-randomly chosen, identified\nand positioned with metric precision using a Trimble\nGeoExplorer GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)\nreceiver. This very large field sample covers the whole\nstudy zone and all the variability of ages, stands and\nspecies that can be encountered when walking across the\nstudy area. Although it is nonsystematic, this sampling is considered\nto represent the specific diversity likely to be encoun-\ntered, as well as the relative proportions of the different\nspecies and their spatial variations within the study area.\nFinally, footprints of past human presence were mapped,\nsuch as footpaths, walls and enclosures or ruins of mountain\nfarms. These markers were supplemented by various additional\nhistorical documents, notably the Napoleonic cadas-\ntre (first local edition: 1813), topographic maps and aerial\nphotographs. Combining these with sources related to past\navalanche events enabled us to put past avalanche activity\nwithin its context (an open or a closed landscape, intensity\nof the pressure on the wood resource, etc.), to even better\ngrasp the characteristics of specific avalanches (their extension\nvia the location of a destroyed building, for example)\nand, more generally, to understand the evolution of the\nstudy area over the past two centuries.\nAirborne laser scanning\nThe topography of the study area and the current state of\nforested slopes were characterised by Airborne Laser\nScanning (LIDAR). LIDAR data were acquired by the\nInstitute of Geographical and Forest Information (IGN) in\nMarch and April 2011. The vegetation was mainly in leafoff\ncondition, and snow remained on the ground in some\nhigh areas. The scanner was an Optech ALTM3100\nmounted on a fixed-wing aircraft flying at 290 km × h−1\n1500 m above the ground. The pulse frequency was 71\nkHz with a scan angle of ±16°. The mean point density\nobtained on the study area was 4.5 m−2. The TerraScan software\nwas used for echo classification in both the ground and\nnonground categories.\nFrom the classified point cloud, two DEM were computed\nat 0.5 m resolution by bilinear interpolation of points classified\nas the ground at locations of pixel centres. The digital\nsurface model (DSM) was computed by retaining the\nhighest altitude of points in each pixel. The canopy height\nmodel (CHM), representing vegetation height, was obtained\nby subtracting the DEM from the DSM. A smoothed 1 m\nresolution DEM was used to extract the topographic characteristics\nof the avalanche paths identified during the geo-\nhistorical inquiry (mean altitude of the release area, vertical\ndrop, etc.; Table 2). Longitudinal and transversal canopy\ntransects were extracted from the CHM to better quantify\nthe variability of the forest stand height as a function of the\nlocation within the study area. Specifically, two transects following\nthe contours at 1000 and 1100 m a.s.l. were con-\nsidered. Three longitudinal transects were also drawn: two\nfollow avalanche path profiles and one corresponds to an\ninterfluve zone between two avalanche paths where trees\ndid not show any visual marks of avalanche activity. These\ntransects were chosen to sample the variability of elevation\nranges and forest cover heights over the study area (Fig. 3).\nTo characterise forest cover further in terms of species\ncomposition, the classification approach of Eysn and others\n(2015) was used. A first discrimination was made between\nconifers and broadleaved trees. In the second step, a distinction\nwas made between pioneer and nonpioneer broad-\nleaved trees. These two distinctions (in two or three classes)\nare useful to understand forest landscape shaping by avalanche\nactivity. Indeed, after a catastrophic avalanche, in\nthe case of mixed forest stands, reforestation generally\ninvolves first pioneer broadleaved trees, then nonpioneer\nbroadleaved trees and eventually conifers. The classification\napproach proposed by Eysn and others (2015) uses basically\nthe CHM and a field sample of trees belonging to the target\nclasses. Hence, our field sample was classified in two or\nFig. 2.

Pioneer and nonpioneer broadleaved trees\nwere distinguished on the basis of the Landolt light index\nvalue, an ecological indicator that assigns an integer\nbetween 1 and 5 to a given species, describing its potential\nto deal with light conditions. Here, a threshold of 2 for the\nLandolt light index was used. In addition to the CHM and\nthe field sample, classification efficiency was improved\nwith optical infrared colour (IRC) ortho-rectified aerial\nimages acquired in 2010 by IGN.

Other maps\ncorrespond to key dates in terms of rural exodus and wars.\nConstitution of the topographic map corpus has been difficult\nbecause of the complex binational history of the study\narea. IGN provided the 1832 Etat-Major map and the most\ncurrent reference map (2007). Other maps were obtained\nfrom the Strasbourg University library, from the Club\nVosgien (a local hiking association which produced its own\nmaps during a significant part of the 20th century) and from\nprivate collections. Depending on the period, the maps\nwere published by IGN, the Karl Flemming Mapping\nInstitute in Berlin and/or the Club Vosgien (Appendix C).\nNote that, for four out of six maps, the exact date of the topographic\nsurvey could not be retrieved. The map is then con-\nsidered via its publication date. In this case, we cannot\nexclude a discrepancy with the actual state of the forest\nareas at the time of the survey, but it is expected to be low\n(i.e. the Club Vosgien map published in 1968 corresponds\nto a survey conducted in 1964).\nMaps and photographs were geo-referenced (in Lambert93\ncoordinates). Aerial photographs were previously orthorectified\nto apply corrections for optical distortions from the\nsensor system and apparent changes in the position of\nground objects caused by the perspective of the sensor view\nangle and ground terrain. On each document, the forest\nareas were carefully manually digitised. Comparing these\nmaps with the LIDAR-based DEM then made it possible to\nderive summary statistics (for each date: forest cover extension,\nmean altitude, maximum altitude, etc.), which allowed\nquantifying the forest cover evolution in the study area over\nnearly two centuries.\nRESULTS\nAvalanche activity and related damage\nThe study area is affected by significant avalanche activity\ngiven that a total of 60 avalanches were identified between\nwinters 1826–27 and 2013–14 by the Giacona and others\n(2017b) enquiry. A fairly regular occurrence of high-intensity\navalanches over nearly two centuries is documented, but\noverall the frequency of avalanches that were retrieved has\nincreased since the 2000s (Fig. 3).\nIn greater detail, our combination of refined field, historical\nand topographical investigations allowed documenting\nthe spatio-temporal characteristics of several of these avalanches\nmore precisely, notably those that caused significant\ndamage. Three avalanches caused casualties in 1850/51\n(two persons killed), 1999/2000 (one death) and 2010/11\n(one person injured; Table 3). Similarly, avalanches in\nwinters 1826/27 and March 1853 (Fig. 4) impacted the\nLeibelthal mountain farm that was exploited in the study\narea at that time (Fig. 5). Historical sources report that the\nfarmer asked for permission to rebuild his farm, which consisted\nof a cottage and a barn. Specifically, in 1853, he\ndeclared that it was ‘in the place most exposed to avalanches\nthat have crushed and overflown it five times in forty years’\n(we could not find any mention of three of these five destructions)\nand therefore asked for permission to rebuild the farm\nat another location where it would be ‘sheltered from periodic\navalanches’ (Departmental Archives of the Haut-Rhin\ndepartment, 7P638: Letter from Mr. Mathias Guthleben,\ndated 24 May 1853, addressed to the prefect of Haut-Rhin).\nRuins of the old and the new Leibelthal farms are still\nvisible today (Fig. 5).\nThe existence of strong interactions between avalanche\nactivity and forests in the study area is reflected in the historical\nsources by the report of 14 avalanches that caused\ndamage to forest stands. For seven of these, that all occurred\nafter the winter 2003/04, the documented damage was slight.\nThe other seven destroyed (very) large forest stands in winters\n1846/47, 1907/08, 1951/52, and 2009/10. At the beginning\nof February 1952, at least three avalanches destroyed ∼20 ha\nof forest, leaving more than 3000m3 of wood deposits (Fig. 2,\nAppendix D). Sources do not mention whether the avalanches\nof winter 1826/27 and March 1853 caused signifi-\ncant forest damage. It is possible that the forest beyond the\npastures was reached by the flow, but the information was\nnot recorded in the sources consulted.\nAmong the 60 avalanches identified, 50 could be located\nprecisely at the paths scale. A total of 13 avalanche paths\nwere mapped in the study area, ten of which are known\nwith certainty since one to ten avalanches are documented\nin each of them by the sources. The three others are considered\nas probable paths since only visible marks of avalanche\nactivity could be spotted in the field, but no specific mention\nof past events was found in historical sources (Fig. 1c). Some\nof the 13 paths already had local toponyms. The others were\nnamed for the purposes of this study (Table 2). Nine of the 13\npaths converge at ∼850 m a.s.l. Only paths 1, 3, 17 and 19\ndo not converge with the main system. However, any of\nthe 13 paths is likely to be active independently of the others.\nRelease areas are oriented mainly north-east to south, and\navalanches are likely triggered by the rupture of a cornice\n(Fig. 1c). Average slope angles of the 13 paths vary between\n25° and 37°. Ten paths have a total length longer than 1 km\nand are likely to produce high-intensity avalanches (up to 5)\nthat reach altitudes <750 m a.s.l. (Table 2). Three paths are\nmuch shorter, ∼300 m long. The maximum possible intensity\nin these latter paths is estimated at 3 (Table 1), corresponding\nto avalanches that do not flow below 1000 m a.s.l.\nCurrent landscape\nThe study area is currently largely forested, with the treeline\nlocated close to the ridges at 1200 m a.s.l. According to our\nTable 3.

For each event, intensity classes refer to the exceedance of the intensity\nlevels positioned in Figure 1.\n118 Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'field survey, tree stands are dominated by Fagus sylvatica and\nAbies alba, which together account for more than 80% of the\ntrees, almost equally distributed between the two species.\nApproximately 10% of the trees are Acer pseudoplatanus.\nTen other species of trees and shrubs were identified and\nwere more scarce, each accounting for <2% of the total.\nAccording to the Landolt classification, six broadleaved\nspecies of the field sample were classified as pioneer,\nwhereas only three skiophilous species (Fagus sylvatica,\nAbies alba and Picea abies) were mapped (Table 4).\nIn the forest landscape, avalanche paths are visible through\nquasi-rectilinear forest openings that are easily identifiable in\nlarge-scale ground photographs of the area (Fig. 6), in aerial\nphotographs (Fig. 1b, Appendix B) and on the CHM (Fig. 3).\nThe CHMhas sufficient spatial resolution to allow visual identification\nof individual trees, which can reach impressive\nheights of up to 50 m. Also, the spatial variability of tree\nheights retrieved from the CHM is very strong, because\nclose-to-zero values are visible along with very high values.\nThis indicates small gaps between large individual trees, demonstrating\nthe high spatial accuracy of the CHM.\nSmoothing the CHM with a moving average filter removes\nthis small-scale spatial variability. This provides a better\nunderstanding of the spatial structuring of tree heights,\nnamely the zones of the study area where trees are, on\naverage, more or less tall. Along altitudinal transects\n(Fig. 7), average canopy height increases with altitude from\n<15 m at 1100 m a.s.l. (Fig. 3, transect 2) to more than 20\nm at 1000 m a.s.l. (Fig. 3, transect 1). The presence of\nnarrow avalanche paths results in a sudden drop in canopy\nheight. At 1100 m a.s.l., paths 4–10 induce a reduction in\ncanopy height over ∼500 m. Height reduction is much\nmore localised in the case of the extremely narrow Couloir\ndu Torrent. The Couloir en S is slightly wider and completely\ndeforested in its central part (Fig. 7).\nAlong longitudinal transect 5 (located on an interfluve\nbetween two avalanche paths), the canopy height increases\nrapidly with greater distance from the release area. It\nreaches 25 m at 500 m and more than 30 m at 900 m from\nthe western edge of the study area. Beyond, the height of\nthe canopy drops, reflecting a much younger tree population.\nCanopy height is quite different along avalanche paths. In the\nFig. 4. Chronology of avalanches identified in the study area by the historical investigation. Along the x-axis, winter 1800 corresponds, for\nexample, to the period from autumn 1800 to spring 1801. Environmental damage refers to avalanches that disrupted forest stands. Among\nthese, after Giacona and others (2017b) we distinguished as severe environmental damage avalanche events that destroyed large forested\nareas.\n119Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'Couloir du Chapeau (transect 4), for example, it reaches 10\nand 15 m at 500 and 900 m, respectively, from the western\nmargins of the study area. Canopy height shows a fairly\nsimilar trend in the Couloir de la Lisière/du Torrent, with,\nfor altitudes between 1250 and 900 m, an increase in tree\nheights well below that observed in zones not impacted by\navalanche activity (transect 5). However, the canopy profile\nis even more disturbed for the Couloir en S (transect 6), with\nalmost no live trees at altitudes above 1000 m a.s.l., which corresponds\nto the deforested zone clearly visible in Figure 3.\nFinally, at the bottom of slopes, (<900 m a.s.l), canopy\nheight becomes similar for all transects, which reflects\nmuch younger stands whose height is controlled by logging\nrather than by avalanche activity.\nThe characteristic organisation of tree species as a function\nof elevation in the Vosges Mountains is a gradual transi-\ntion of altitude beech forests near the summits to mixed\nbeech-fir forest at the slope bottom. It still exists in the part\nof the slopes that are not affected by avalanche activity or\nlogging (Fig. 1c). In avalanche paths, the species pattern is\nmore complex. The beech-fir forest is replaced by pioneer\nspecies in active paths (Fig. 8a) or herbaceous species in\ndeforested areas (Figs 9c and d). Mapping the species\nclasses allows an assessment of the species organisation\nthroughout the study area. Success rates in cross-validation\nof 79% (two classes) and 68% (three classes) were obtained.\nThese rather high values indicate that the mapped classes\n(Figs 8b and c) broadly reflect the empirical distribution of\nspecies classes within the field sample (Fig. 8a).\nIn the immediate vicinity of avalanche release zones,\npioneer broadleaved trees predominate. These are accompanied\nby beech trees of increasing size as one moves down-\nslope. Intermediate altitudes correspond to avalanche paths\nand runout zones of low-intensity avalanches (up to 3 on\nour 5-level scale), where beech–fir mixed forests are found.\nCanopy height and the proportion of conifers rapidly\nincrease as altitude decreases. Altitudes under 1000 m a.s.l.\nare reached by high-intensity avalanches only (more than 3\non our 5-level scale). Conifers become dominant and in\nthis area reach their greatest heights. At the lowest altitudes\nFig. 5. Material stakes at risk in and around the Rothenbachkopf-Rainkopf avalanche complex: (a) farm buildings mentioned on the Etat Major\nmap (survey in 1832), (b) extract of the cadastral atlas of Metzeral township corresponding to the study area (drawn in 1813, reworked after\n1889), (d) 2011 photograph of the ruins of the Leibelthal farm building that was destroyed by avalanches during the first half of the 19th\ncentury, (c) 2011 photograph of the ruins of the farm building that replaced it during the second half of the 19th century.\n120 Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', '(below 900 m a.s.l.), conifers are even more dominant, but\ntheir heights remain more limited due to periodic logging.\nThe species classification also shows comparable gradients\nfrom the centre to the margins of avalanche paths, namely\nfrom deforested areas occupied by herbaceous vegetation\nat the centre of the paths to an undisturbed mature forest at\nthe far margins (Fig. 3). Hence, at the species level, avalanche\npaths are corridors for broadleaved tree species and\neven herbaceous species to penetrate at lower altitudes\n(Fig. 8c). This deeply shapes the visual aspect of the forest\nslopes and its high variability across seasons (Fig. 6).\nLandscape evolution over two centuries\nThe diachronic analysis of historical maps and aerial photographs\nallows quantification of the forest evolution in the\narea since 1832 (Figs 10 and 11). According to topographic\nmaps (Figs 12a and b), the forest area, <1 km2 (∼60% of the\nsurface of the study area) in 1832, increased to 1.35 km2\n(∼80%) in 2007, passing through a minimum in 1932\n(53%). At the same time, a regular and strong increase of\naverage and maximum forest cover altitudes, on the order of\n80 m, is documented between 1832 and 1964 (Fig. 12e).\nAerial photographs show an increase of ∼35 m in the\nmaximum altitudes between 1976 and 2010, reflecting\nrecent colonisation of steep slopes in the immediate vicinity\nof avalanche release areas (Fig. 12f). Both sources agree\nthat, since the mid-20th century, forest cover at intermediate\naltitudes of the study area has become much denser (i.e.\nareas without forests have become forested; Fig. 12). All in\nall, the forest has undergone substantial yet irregular expansion\nover the last two centuries. Afforestation took place\nthroughout the whole period covered, but predominantly\nover the second half of the 20th century, resulting in a treeline\nnow just below the ridges, and in a generally closed landscape\n(Fig. 1b, Appendix B caption D).\nIn greater detail, changes resulting from avalanche activity\ncan be detected. For example, according to aerial\nphotographs, the forest surface rate of 68% in 1951\ndropped as a result of avalanches in winter 1951/52 (direct\ndestruction, Appendix D, and then post-event silvicultural\nmaintenance) and increased rapidly again after 1976\n(Fig. 11b–d). Just before avalanche occurrences, all paths\nwere afforested. In 1968 (first aerial photograph available\nafter 1952, Appendix B, caption C), the large paths of the\narea were reopened. In 1976, the forest area was minimal,\nand the delineation of forest areas was very simple, probably\ndue to the exploitation of the slope to clean residual forest\nbreakdowns. Afterwards, afforestation was very rapid, due\nto the combined effect of natural recolonisation and, probably,\nplantation of trees intended to erase the stigmas of ava-\nlanche damage at certain distant locations of runout zones\n(Fig. 12). It is noteworthy that avalanches in winter 2009/\n10 (intensity 3–4) only slightly affected forest cover (−1%\nbetween 2001 and 2010; Fig. 12) despite the significant\ndamage observed (reopening of paths 1–2 over fairly large\nareas; Fig. 10). This highlights in contrast that the effects of\nthe 1951/52 avalanches (intensity 5) were extreme at the\nscale of the study area.\nChanges in forest areas related to avalanche activity are\nless clear on topographic maps with lower resolution. For\nexample, the impacts of the 1951/52 avalanches are only\nvisible on the 1964 map at the bottom of paths 4–10, and\nto a lesser extent at the top of paths 8–10. From this\nexample, we can reasonably hypothesise that the opening\nof paths 4–10, upstream and downstream between 1832\nand 1900, and then upstream between 1900 and 1921, at\nleast partially results from the major avalanches recorded in\nthe archives during winters 1846/47 and 1907/08 (Fig. 11,\nAppendix D).\nDISCUSSION\nLandscape organisation in the study area\nQuasi-equilibrium between forest stands and regular\navalanche activity\nThe avalanche frequency documented by the historical\ninvestigation of the study area has been greater since the\n2000s. Nevertheless, as in the entire Vosges Mountain\nrange, this certainly reflects a pronounced bias related to\nsources much more than a natural evolution of the phenomenon\n(Giacona and others, 2017b). Indeed, during recent\nwinters, the few medium–high-intensity avalanches that\nwere recorded were accompanied by a large number of\nsmall avalanches that did not cause significant damage.\nTable 4.

It\nis, therefore, very likely that low-intensity avalanches also\nfrequently occurred in the area throughout the entire study\nperiod but were not retrieved in the sources.\nFrom a spatial point of view, the historical enquiry identified\npast events on all except three paths of the study area. In\naddition, on all 13 paths of the study area, clear visible marks\nof (rather) recent avalanche activity were identified by field\nvisits. As a consequence, all the study area’s paths may still\nbe active, even if it cannot be excluded on the basis of the\ndata analysed here that, at least for a few paths, avalanche\nactivity is now less strenuous than it was earlier (see the\nsection ‘Landscape evolution linked to changing human\npressure and climate’). This situation differs from the lowest\nelevation sites of the Vosges Mountains where Giacona\nand others (2017b) found no proof, either in historical\nsources or in the field, of recent avalanche activity.\nAt the same time, the current forest landscape was\ndescribed through the forest canopy height and the species\ncomposition (our two- or three-species classes). These two\nmetrics were evaluated in the entire study area by combining\nfield visits and LIDAR data. They truly characterise the largescale\nvisual aspect of the slopes which we aimed to describe\nand understand. It appeared that the natural altitudinal zonation\nof the tree stands (heights and species composition)\nremains visible only in the areas that are not (or very rarely)\naffected by avalanche activity. Elsewhere on the slopes, the\nforest structure is considerably different, which leads to the\nconclusion that avalanche activity is indeed a significant\ndriver of the aspect of the forest landscape in the study\narea. Specifically, forest stands present patterns that are longitudinally\nand transversely structured by the position of ava-\nlanche paths. The visual aspect of these patterns varies across\nseasons as a function of the species composition. Hence,\nexcept in the Hautes Chaumes and in the lowest altitudes\nof the study area where avalanche activity is almost absent\nand where the landscape reflects above all pastoral and\nforest exploitation, avalanche activity plays a major role in\nthe landscape genesis. We, therefore, postulate that the\nlandscape organisation of the area results primarily from a\nquasi-equilibrium between forest stands and avalanche\nactivity (frequency of impacts, flow velocity pressure and\nmaximum height). In other words, the greater the avalanche\nactivity, the more one finds individuals, stands and species\nthat are able to cope with the impacts (resilience to impacts\nvia flexion, wound healing, adoption of specific morphologies,\netc.).\nField observations in favour of the existence of such equilibrium\nhave already been documented by several previous\nstudies (e.g. Malanson and Butler, 1984; Veblen and others,\n1994; Rixen and others, 2007). We arguably contribute\nnew evidence of this in the context of a mountain range\nwhere interactions between avalanche activity and forest\nstands are exacerbated since the treeline is close to or even\nabove the release areas. In addition, our results were obtained\nusing a combination of methods, including LIDAR data processing,\nwhich has been, to our knowledge, rarely used for\nthis purpose to date. This allowed computing detailed forest\nmetrics over the whole zone, which supplemented more traditional\nfield surveys and allowed an area-wide investigation of\nthe forest landscape. Hence, our approach appears to be a\nuseful complement to most of the recent studies that privilege\nsmall-scale investigations of avalanche–forest interactions\nand their ecological consequences on forest stands (e.g.,\nSchönenberger and others, 2005; Bebi and others, 2009).\nLandscape opening – closure cycles due to major\navalanches\nGeo-historical and diachronic analyses show that the equilibrium\nbetween forest stands and avalanche activity is, in\nthe study area, fairly regularly disrupted by exceptional avalanches.\nThese high-magnitude events destroy stands often\nreached by less severe avalanches and which are, therefore,\naccording to Feistl and others (2015), more or less resilient to\nimpacts. They also reach mature stands located outside usual\navalanche-prone areas. As documented – for example,\nTakeuchi and others (2011) for a case study in Japan – the\nresult is an opening of the landscape over large and wide\nFig. 6. Visual aspect of the study area over the seasons: (a) in winter\n2010, (b) in late summer 2015, (c) in winter 2009, and (d) in late\nspring 2016. Path numbers and names are provided in Table 2,\nand localised in Figure 1.\n122 Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'areas (Fig. 2), at the end of which a large volume of wood is\ndeposited (Fig. 9). At this abrupt opening of the landscape\nfollows a re-closing of the landscape spanning a few\ndecades.\nOver the entire study period, this type of cycle seems to\nhave occurred four times, following the major avalanches\ndocumented during the winters 1846/47, 1907/08, 1950/51\nand 2009/10. The last cycle is in progress, with the re-colonisation\nof the post-event landscape already started (Fig. 9e).\nThe previous cycle, following the even greater number of\navalanches of winter 1950/51, was well documented with\naerial photographs. In <50 years, the devastated paths\nhave been totally re-closed (Fig. 6). The data available\nregarding the two previous cycles is more tenuous.\nNevertheless, sources clearly describe the magnitude of avalanche\ndamage in winters 1846/47 and 1907/08 (Appendix\nD), and historical maps suggest that local openings in some\npaths occurred (Fig. 10) at a time when the overall dynamics\nof landscape closure was already in place. Of course, we\nknow that a large fraction of the avalanches that actually\noccurred long ago is missing in the chronology illustrated\nin Figure 3. On the other hand, we are rather confident that\nmost, if not all, major events that occurred over the study\nperiod were retrieved. Hence, we postulate that winters generating\navalanches of sufficient magnitude to heavily damage\nforests seem to have occurred fairly regularly in the zone over\nthe study period, every 50 years or so (that avalanches that\ncaused severe environmental damage in Fig. 3).\nAll in all, avalanche activity structures the forest landscape\nof the zone not only through equilibrium in which the location\nof the different stands does not change over time. In add-\nition, the slopes evolve in a quasi-cyclical manner, where the\nobservable landscape depends on the time of the openingclosing\ncycle. In particular, the characteristics of stands\n(size of the individuals, species) visible at a given location\nevolve over time according to the growth rates of tree individuals\nand the ability of species to recolonise cleared spaces.\nAs a consequence, the landscape of the study area has a high\nspatial but also temporal variability, with the recolonisation\nareas characterised by an ever-changing gradient of\nspecies, morphologies and colours. For instance, in devastated\nareas, the few remaining highly damaged stems are\nquickly accompanied by colourful herbaceous plants.\nThese are then replaced by pioneer trees followed by nonpioneer\ntrees of increasing size as the closure phase of the cycle\ncontinues (Fig. 9). Such cyclic effects with a succession of\nphases of brutal landscape opening by avalanches and progressive\nclosure by forest recolonisation were previously\nhighlighted in different locations (Foster and others, 1998;\nKajimoto and others, 2004;Garavaglia and Pelfini, 2011).\nFig. 7.

Path numbers correspond to Figure 1 and path names to Table 2.\n123Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'Landscape evolution linked to changing human pressure\nand climate\nIn the long history of resource exploitation of the Vosges\nMountains, the beginning of the study period corresponds\nto a phase of landscape opening stemming from the combination\nof pressures exerted on the forests by agro-pastoral\npractices and proto-industrial activities consuming wood\n(Garnier, 2004). At the much more local scale, it is clear\nthat the Rothenbachkopf-Rainkopf avalanche complex was\nparticularly marked by agro-pastoralism. According to the\ncadastre and the État-Major map, many mountain farms\nwere active in the immediate vicinity of the study area\nduring the 19th century (Matter, 2010) including the\nLeibelthal area, which was destroyed several times by avalanches\nduring the 19th century. This farm already existed\nat the beginning of the study period since it is known that\nthere were 11 cows there in 1796 (Matter, 2010).\nIt was estimated that, in the Munster Valley where our\nstudy area is located, during the 1970s 4800 ha of the surface\nthat were no longer grazed were evolving to more or less\nshrubby moors (Établissement National d’Enseignement\nSupérieur Agronomique, 1995; Simon, 2002). This context of\nland abandonment and afforestation that prevailed during the\nstudy period over the Vosges Mountains is quite obvious as\nwell for the study area. Although the cessation of pastoral activity\nin Leibelthal could not be precisely dated, it is certain that\nthe ‘new’ farm remained in a state of ruin after the Second\nWorld War (Matter, 2010). At the same time, an impact in\nthe study area of the reforestation policies conducted at the\nscale of the massif is likely, as suggested by the regular stands\nof young conifers we identified at elevations below 800 m a.\ns.l. Hence, changing anthropogenic pressures over the study\nperiod was clearly responsible for a dramatic forest cover evolution\nin the study area. We were able to document the signifi-\ncant elevation of the tree line since 1832 from historical maps\nand photographs, and the current presence of pioneer broadleaved\ntrees was mapped in the immediate vicinity of the\nridges, tangible proofs of this major landscape closure dynamics.\nThis landscape closure resulting from agriculture abandon-\nment and reforestation is not surprising because it has been\ndocumented in many mountain ranges in developed countries\nover the last two centuries. Its dynamics were of variable temporality\nand intensity depending on the social contexts but the\nphenomenon has often accelerated since the end of the Second\nWorld War (e.g. Moriniaux, 1999; Deuffic, 2005; Labrue,\n2009; Spielmann and others, 2013).\nThese changing anthropogenic constraints on the environment\nmay have combined with the climatic context of the\nlate LIA. Indeed, at the beginning of the study period,\nregular exploitation of the area was concomitant with a\ncolder and, to a lesser extent, less humid climate\n(Appendix A), which limited the extent of the forest, particularly\nin the upper slopes of the study area. Then gradual\nwarming associated with a slightly wetter climate occurred\nat the same time as pastoral pressure decreased, which\nresulted in rapid afforestation. We do not exclude that the\nclimate warming context was not necessary for the landscape\nclosure to occur, but it seems reasonable to postulate that it\nhas accelerated the afforestation process by creating conditions\nmore favourable to tree colonisation and growth.\nFurthermore, by decreasing snow amounts and hence the\npropagation of avalanche events downslope, climate\nwarming may also have indirectly sped up the reforestation\nprocess. We cannot provide any quantitative assessment\nover the entire study period of natural avalanche activity\nresponse to climate change in the study area on the basis\nof the data available. This is because of the strong impact\nof historical sources on the homogeneity of avalanche\nrecords (Giacona and others, 2017b) that precludes from\neasily inferring avalanche–climate linkages over the long\nrange, in the Vosges Mountains like elsewhere (e.g. Eckert\nand others, 2013; Ballesteros-Cánovas and others, 2018).\nHowever, our historical enquiry truly documents, despite\nthe overall recent increase on the record, more extreme\nand/or highly destructive avalanches in the distant past,\nwith no more intensity five avalanches since winter 1950/\n51, and several intensity five avalanches that caused building\ndestructions, major forest damage and killed people during\nthe 19th century. This is consistent with the existence of\nextinct avalanche sites at lower elevations in the Vosges\nMountains. Such qualitative hints suggest that avalanche\nactivity has truly decreased in the study area as the climate\nwas warming, at least in terms of the magnitude of the\nevents. By releasing a disturbance agent that previously\nlimited forest colonisation of the upper slopes, this may\nhave contributed to landscape closure in the area.\nFig. 8. Spatial distribution of tree species in the study area: (a) Trees\nidentified by direct field investigations conducted between 2014\nand 2017 (Table 4), (b) results of the 2-class classification of tree\nspecies, (c) results of the 3-class classification of tree species.\n124 Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'Wider relevance of the results obtained\nEven if we have never attempted to extrapolate our data\noutside the study area, we are convinced that similar\nresults could have been obtained for the majority of the\nother nearby circuses. The Rothenbachkopf-Rainkopf\ncomplex has indeed been chosen as representative of the\nglacial circus constituting the eastern edge of the Vosges\nMountains in terms of biophysical parameters (tree stands,\ngeomorphology, prevailing climatic conditions, Flageollet,\n2003; Goepp, 2007; Wahl and others, 2009). However, as\nstated above, although the social context remains broadly\ncomparable at the scale of the entire Vosges Mountains\n(agro-pastoral abandonment and reforestation), local disparities\n(continuation, development or cessation of pastoralism\nand/or logging, etc.) may have caused differentiated landscape\ntrajectories over the long term in a few specific loca-\ntions. Testing these hypotheses will require reproducing the\nanalysis with a similar methodology on other nearby areas.\nSimilarly, it is likely that the results obtained in terms of the\nlandscape impact of avalanche–forest interactions remain\nrelevant over an even wider area in temperate mountain\nranges, especially medium-high ranges. For this, it is a priori\nonly required that the slopes and the snow cover are sufficient\nto allow a regular avalanche activity and that the climate is\nmild enough to allow the development of a forest cover over\na significant part of the paths, as suggested by the good agreement\nbetween our results and the already existing literature\nregarding forest stand organisation and avalanche activity\nand the opening effect of major avalanches.\nIn terms of long-term evolution, the climatic context of\naccelerated global warming over the last few decades is a\nworldwide reality (IPCC, 2013), but the evolution of the pressures\nexerted on the territory is extremely variable from one\nmassif to another. Therefore, landscape dynamics during\nthe last few centuries in response to avalanche activity,\nclimate and human pressure may have been much different\nfrom one mountain range to another. Due to the current\nlack of quantitative studies addressing the area-wide landscape\ndynamics response to these three drivers combined\ntogether, comparison with other results is difficult. It can be\nreasonably estimated that, in many mountain ranges affected\nby avalanche activity, the influence of humans was less\ndurable and less intense than in the Vosges Mountains, especially\noutside Europe. In such cases, the avalanche–forest\ninteraction and climatic patterns may well be the main\nfactors at play. However, results similar to ours could\nFig. 9. Landscape footprints of the 2009/10 major avalanches in the study area: (a, b) devastated post-avalanche landscapes in spring 2010\n(Couloir du Torrent – number 2); bloomingDigitalis pupurea in summer 2014 in opened areas of (c) Couloir en S – number 1 and (d) Couloir du\nTorrent; (e) opened area and beginning of forest recolonisation in summer 2010 (Couloir du Torrent seen from the ridge).\n125Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'probably be obtained in many medium-high mountain\nranges of developed countries that have been submitted to\nthe same socio-environmental changes over the last few\ncenturies.\nThe profound footprints of human activity in the landscape\nof the Vosges Mountains are related to their long history, and\nhence to their rich cultural heritage. This substantially\nincreases the complexity of landscape genesis (for instance,\nthe ‘initial state’ for now appears out of reach) with regard\nto massifs where human influence is much less perceptible.\nAs a corollary to such difficulties, rich information can be\ncollected in various archives over long periods, which is\nimpossible in barely and/or recently populated areas. The\nlong-lasting human occupation and relatively modest size\nof massifs like the Vosges Mountains, therefore, make them\nvaluable living laboratories for the study of the trajectories\nof socio-environmental systems over recent centuries.\nPro and cons of the chosen approach and outlooks\nFor the mapping of forest areas, manual digitalisation was\npreferred over automatic processing for both historical\nmaps and aerial photographs. This approach was possible\nbecause of the (relatively) small size of the study area. The\ntime necessary was, therefore, reasonable while it allowed\nprecision that could not have been reached with an automatic\nprocedure, in particular for the oldest topographic\nmaps. Working both on maps and photographs to establish\nthe diachronic evolution of the forest cover combined the\nstrengths of the two types of sources. Estimates provided by\naerial photographs are more variable from one date to\nanother, which is related to their higher resolution. This\nallowed capturing detailed changes in forests, difficult to\ngrasp from the sole analysis of topographic maps. The potential\nof the latter for precisely measuring the impact of ava-\nlanche activity on forest stands appeared to be more\nlimited. However, the area-wide summary statistics (surfaces,\naltitudes, etc.) provided by maps and photographs over the\nrecent period have proved to be comparable (Fig. 11). This\nsatisfactory agreement, particularly in view of the probable\nlow accuracy of the forest surfaces derived from the topographic\nmaps, suggests that the latter are indeed sufficient\nto roughly quantify the forest evolution over the study area\nfor the entire post-1832 period.\nAlso, one may express doubts regarding our tree species\nclassification approach. In the literature (Eysn and others,\nFig. 10. Forest cover in the study area for 6 years (in black in the top-right corner) based on ortho-rectified aerial photographs.\n126 Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', '2015), this approach is known to perform well for dominant\nand co-dominant trees, whose crowns are visible in the\nCHM. Yet, field trees were sampled whatever their dominance\nstatus in the canopy, which may have lowered the clas-\nsification accuracy. However, the two/three class species\npatterns that were obtained proved to be easy to interpret\nand coherent with field observations (satisfactory cross-validation\nscores with a large sample of tree species sampled\nthroughout the study area, and similar spatial patterns in\nthe field sample and classification results). We, therefore,\nbelieve that, even if locally all trees are not perfectly classified,\nthis approach is sufficient to capture the main pattern\nof species distribution over the study area.\nIt seems possible in the near future to considerably refine\nthe mapping of the frequency and extent of past avalanches\nin the study area. This improvement could be achieved using\ntree-ring techniques (e.g., Dubé and others, 2004; Corona\nand others, 2012; Schläppy and others, 2013), or, more\nsimply, via an analysis of the spatial distribution of visible\nscars and stem morphologies. This was not undertaken in\nthis study, where we limited the quantification of avalanche\nactivity to empirical frequencies from archives at the path\nscale. This choice was made because the goal of this work\nwas not refined inference of avalanche–forest interactions\nin the study area. Instead, the avalanche occurrence data\nwere used to show: (i) that the zone remains currently very\nactive and (ii) that major events in the past destroyed large\nforest stands, which could be linked to the forest cover evolution\ninferred from maps and photographs. Similarly, ava-\nlanche data helped localise avalanche paths along with\nfield visits and topographic surveys with sufficient accuracy\nto understand the current patterns of tree heights and\nspecies inferred from the LIDAR survey. This is even truer\ngiven that other natural disturbances are extremely limited\nin the study area. All in all, characterisation of avalanche\nactivity in the area proved sufficient to show that it is one\nof the drivers, among others, of the large-scale visual\naspect of the complex forest landscape, both in its current\nstate and in terms of how it has evolved over the last two\nand a half centuries.\nIn terms of the forest landscape, we concentrated on a few\nvariables that could be evaluated throughout the study area\nfrom the data available: tree heights and species classes as\na function of space for the current landscape, and the\nFig. 11. Forest cover in the study area for 6 years (in black in the top-right corner) based on topographic maps. See Appendix C for details\nabout the map editions used.\n127Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'extent of the forest cover as a function of time. Here again,\nwe know we could have done more in terms of the smallscale\nstudy of forest stands, including a detailed analysis of\nthe species’ preferential stands, tree diameters, the percentage\nof living/dead individuals, the number and magnitude\nof visible avalanche marks as a function of, for example,\nthe distance to avalanche paths or anthropogenic pressure,\netc. However, the analysis of such metrics is beyond the\nscope of this paper and more difficult to conduct over the\nentire study area. As a consequence, the small-scale\nrefined characterisation of the forest landscape will be part\nof further work in combination with additional information\nfrom tree rings regarding avalanche frequency and magnitude\nas a function of space.\nSimilarly, to quantify the respective impact of humans,\navalanches and climate in the shaping the area’s landscape,\nand how the weights of these drivers may have possibly\nchanged over time, a complete evaluation of anthropogenic\npressure (grazing pressure, forest logging), avalanche activity\nand climate relative to time would be required. This appears\nto be a challenging but appealing outlook for future study. As\ncollateral benefits, it may provide additional useful outputs\nsuch as a more quantitative assessment of climate change\nimpacts on snow cover and avalanches in the area. In this\nstudy, our goal was more modest: showing (i) that over the\nstudy period, humans, avalanches and climate all played a\nrole, directly or at least indirectly, in the genesis of the\nforest landscape and (ii) that at a given time, the history of\nthese drivers has been integrated by the forest landscape in\nits visual aspect. The length of the landscape memory is\nnot entirely quantified, except that the time-lag of forest\nopening–closure cycles due to major avalanches is evaluated\nat ∼50 years.\nFinally, in this study, the relations between the components\nof the complex forest system under study have been\napprehended only in one direction. Yet, feedback and indirect\neffects are actually more likely to be combined (e.g.,\nTeich and others, 2014; Zurbriggen and others, 2014). For\ninstance, if the avalanche activity structures forest stands,\nin return, these affect avalanche activity: the gradual afforestation\nof avalanche release zones that we have demonstrated\ncould further reduce avalanche activity, as demonstrated by\nGarcía-Hernández and others (2017) for the Asturian massif.\nThis could, in turn, facilitate tree colonisation up to the main\nridges. Hence, determining the cause and consequence is\nnot necessarily easy. In addition to the different outlooks\nalready listed, further progress in understanding this complexity\nmay require simulation-based approaches of the\nforest ecosystem, making it possible, for example, to test different\nassumptions regarding its functioning and, in fine,\ncombined with detailed modelling of the future local snow\nand weather drivers, provide robust predictions for the\nfuture evolution of the study area under ongoing global\nchange.\nCONCLUSION\nThe aim of this work was to demonstrate on a case study representative\nof avalanche-prone areas of the VosgesMountains\n(France) that the footprints of avalanche activity, humans and\nclimate can be retained by the landscape, and that the evolution\nof these drivers has been integrated into its rapid changes\nover more than two centuries. Clear links were established\nbetween the characteristics of the forest stands and the position\nof avalanche paths. Specifically, the height of individual\ntrees and the species composition appeared to be organised\nFig. 12. Quantitative evolution of the forest stands in the study area: (a, b) forested area; (c, d) fraction of total area; (e, f) forested altitude range.\nSummary statistics based on topographic maps (left) and ortho-rectified aerial photographs (right).\n128 Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'both longitudinally and transversely to avalanche paths, in\nnear-equilibrium with regular avalanche activity. Also, the\nexistence of quasi-cyclic opening–closure cycles of an ∼50year\nperiodicity was demonstrated. Induced by major ava-\nlanches, these cycles result in continuous changes in the\nlandscape mosaic. However, the major pattern identified\nover the study period was a substantial afforestation of the\nslopes resulting in a now almost complete landscape\nclosure. This is primarily attributable to profound changes in\nsilvo-pastoral practices over the study period but was presumably\naccelerated by the impact of climate change, at least\nindirectly (reduction of disturbances to forest stands due to\navalanche activity).\nAll in all, with regard to previous work conducted on snow\navalanches in the Vosges Mountains (Giacona and others,\n2017a, b), this study has supplemented the constitution of\nan avalanche chronology from historical sources with an\nin-depth study of the landscape genesis in a specific area.\nThe results demonstrated the role played by different\ndrivers, among which avalanches, which, in turn, involved\ndocumenting with higher accuracy avalanche interactions\nwith forests and human activities in the zone. With regard\nto the wider existing literature, this study may have\nrenewed the rather old topic of snow avalanches as a landscape\ngenesis factor by choosing an area-wide approach\ninstead of a more local analysis of interactions between avalanche\nactivity and forest stands. Also, by focusing on a\nmedium-high mountain range in Western Europe, additional\neffects due to man and climate could be considered within\nthe same analysis. This was permitted by a combination of\nsources that are diverse, some of which had rarely been\nused for this purpose (LIDAR, etc.). Their complementarity\nin documenting current and past landscapes with high accuracy\nat the scale of the entire study area should be a guarantee\nof the robustness of the conclusions reached. However, this\nwork should be reproduced in other contexts and pursued\nin various ways to improve our understanding of a very\ncomplex mechanics.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by Université Grenoble Alpes\n(RARETES grant – avalanche risk as the revealer of longrange\ninteractions between environment and society,\nAGIR-PEPS 2016 program) and by IDEX Grenoble (CrossDisciplinary\nProgram Trajectories).

The annual average\ntemperature signal (Fig. 13a) clearly shows, beyond its interannual\nvariability, the sharpness of the PAG signal before\n1900 (the 15-year moving average is almost constantly\nbelow 9°C, with decades particularly cold ∼1810 and\n1850) as well as the intense warming that followed (∼+1°C\nover the 1900–1950 period). Other available point station\ndata from the surrounding area (not shown) and Pfister’s\nregional indexes (Fig. 13b) confirm this signal (R= 0.94\nbetween annual values of Pfister’s temperature index and\ntemperatures in Basel, R= 0.97 between moving averages\nover 15 years, both values significant at the 0.05% level on\nthe basis of a Student test). Pfister’s precipitation index\n(Fig. 13c) suggests that, at the regional level, the concomitant\nFig. 13. Mean annual temperature and precipitation: (a) temperature\nin Basel, Switzerland; Pfister’s temperature (b) and precipitation (c)\nindexes. Annual values were computed from the available monthly\ndata covering October to September periods. For example, the\n1900 value corresponds to the mean of October 1900 to September\n1901 monthly values. Pfister’s indexes are monthly values between\n−3 and 3 evaluated from various historical sources and are valid\nfor Central Europe. 0 represents an average behaviour, −3 an\nextremely cold/dry value compared with the average, and +3 an\nextremely hot/humid value compared with the average.\n131Giacona and others: Avalanche activity and socio-environmental changes leave strong footprints in forested landscapes\n', 'evolution towards a wetter climate generally attributed to the\nPAG termination (Grove, 1988) existed, but that it has been\nvery slight (R= 0.25 between 15-year moving averages of\nPfister’s temperature and precipitation indexes, significant\nat the 0.05% level on the basis of a Student test).\nAPPENDIX B\nEXAMPLE OF HISTORICAL MAPS AND AERIAL\nPHOTOGRAPHS SUPPORTING THE DIACHRONIC\nANALYSIS\nSee Fig. 14.\nFig. 14.
