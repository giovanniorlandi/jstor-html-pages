Phone tL, School Notes, The Qualities in Teachers, That School Boards Pay For, - «-1, The uality in the teacher that is, most reflected in the pay-check is, the ability and willingness to serve, the public in the way the public, wants to be served. This is just, as true in teaching as in any other, business in which the compensation, depends upon the good will of the, public. This does not mean that the, teacher must submerge her own per, sonality and become a time-serving, hypocrite with an eye fixed on the, possible financial returns that might, accrue as a result of keeping the, good will, at whatever cost, of Mr., So-and-So., But the teacher is employed on the, assumption that he or she possesses, certain characteristics and qualifi, cations that especially fit him or, her to become the public servant of, a community. And in becoming such, a servant of the public one must, realize that the public is a cosmo, politan- body, possessing as many, turns and traits of character as, there are individuals composing the, social fabric, and that for each of, these different individuals there will, probably be a different method of, attack. The one thing most neces, sary to be borne clearly in mind is, that each one of these persons into, whose life the teacher enters must, somehow be pleased; must become, the friend and advocate of the teach, er, or the work with the child is, either largely wasted or neutralized, by the hostile attitude of the par, ent., Among the assets of the teacher, may be named: Scholarship, cheer, fulness, self-control, generalship, all, round efficiency, and a desire to, serve., Mary Roberts Rhinehart thinks, that the school may well use the, film for the daily teachi.vg of both, geography and history. She says:, “As long as ten years ago, while, in Vienna, 1 saw geography being, taught in this way to public school, pupils. The interest of the children, was held far better than by the, other method. They were concentrat, ing on their subject and enjoying, the study. When I studied history,, had 1 been shown a picture of the, cotton gin, for instance, arid how ii, operates, I might have taken a real, interest in the date of ils inven, tion. The picture would have im, pressed my mind so that by asso, ciation of ideas the date would have, remained with me.”, Last month our school broke all, records by having a total of one, hundred-one visitors. Miss Spence’s, room had the largest number, thirty, five, while Miss Eastman had just, one less to the credit of her room,, this giving the picture to Miss, Spence’s room by a very close mar, gin., Miss Haggland’s room retains the, picture given for the best average, in attendance and punctuality. The, school has improved wonderfully in, the matter of punctuality for which, the contest for possession of the pic, ture is largely responsible, as all, are anxious to help gain it for their, own room., On the day before the Thanks, giving vacation a very interesting, program consisting of recitations,, songs and a pageant, was given by, the pupils of the first five grades in, Miss Spence’s room.

She appealed to the man, principal who replied. "Next time, you have the class, let me know,, and I\'ll come in and take charge of, it, I think I can settle Johnnie.”, He was duly called in. and all went, well at. first. AViith confidence the, principal said at the conclusion of, the lesson, “Now you may ask me, one question.” Johnnie had been, silent up to this time.

The candidate\'s brow, wrinkled. “Which?” he inquired., “What do you understand the word, \'jeopardized\' to mean?”, For just one short minute he, hesitated.

During the week Women\'s Clubs,, Chambers of Commerce, Parent, Teacher Associations, etc., should, devote one meeting to a discussion, of the educational needs of their, community and of the territory., 3. The moving picture show may, be utilized as a means of present, ing facts and figures. Slides should, be prepared setting forth statistics, as to; (a) enrollment; (b) costs;, (c) scope of work; (d) necessity for, regularity of attendance; (e) the, cost to the city and territory of, failures who must remain in school, even a year longer than necessary;, (f) the need of the school, etc., Many other things will suggest, themselves. Do you know that there, ere people in your community who, will be surprised to learn that the, high school offers Spanish or that, shorthand and tyewriting are, taught?, 4. Teachers in both elementary, and high schools should devote a fevr*, hours during the week to the subject, of schools, telling the pupils about, education in the community and na, tion, how the schools are support- ■*, ed and how much money is spent, for them, their economic, social and, civic value and other facts of in, terest., 5. English classes may well hold, debates, taking for their subject, some topic relating to education in, the local community, territory 01, nation., If each school adopts all or even a, part of the above suggestions, there, is no doubt but that much good wiii, accrue to the cause of education in, the territory from the observance of, School Week., (Continued on Page Three), Complete Line Nippon China, HAS JUST BEEN RECEIVED, Dinner Sets, in White and Gold Hand, Painted., Also Carry Fancy Decorated Tea Sets and, Odd Pieces., PAUL BLOEDHORN, WATCHMAKER, CORDOVA FISH & COLD STORAGE CO., Swift’s No. 1, Steer Beef, ALL KINDS OF MEATS AND POULTRY, FISH, CRABS AND CLAM8, Order by Phone 141—3 Rings Or our driver will call on you, GENERAL MACHINE WORK OIL WELL DRILLING MACHINERY SUPPLIES, HARMON MACHINERY COMPANY, INC., MAIN STEAMER DOCK EST. 1914 CORDOVA, ALASKA]', '[Alaska, Steamship Company, Regular Sailings Between Seattle,, Ketchikan, Juneau, Cordova, Valdez,, El\'amar, Liscuni, Latouche, Seward., FROM SEATTLE— 8AILS SOUTM, Dec. 5 .

The, administration has boasted that no, one has been indicted or prosecuted, for any of the hundreds of crimes, indicated by the disclosures con, cerning public waste, and worse,, which have been made public. With, such a defense of this saturnalia of, extravagance and corruption the, people are not satisfied. Nor are, they satisfied to let the matter drop, now., Now is the time to settle, once, for all, the fact that it is not safe, for any man or set of men, to loot, the public treasury at a time when, the millions who bear the burdens, of war, pay the bills and give the, lives and make the sacrifices, are, contributing so much that their na, tion may be defended. Now is the, time to destroy the idea, once for, all, that in the midst of such a, crisis cunning and unprincipled men, and groups of men may successfully, conspire to waste the substance of, the government to their own profit,, and then get away with it, without, an effort, being made to ferret out, and punish the offenders., It is impossible to be lieve that, all that has happened in Washing, ton and everywhere throughout the, country in connnection with war, waste, could have happened without, the collusion of “higher ups.” Every, sacrifice of public to private in, terest in connection with the pur, chase, use and sale of war materials;, every misuse of war power for per, sonal or party purpose, should lie, investigated and exposed; and in, every case where there are not laws, that can be invoked for adequate, punishment, the responsible agents, of the government ought to be pub, licly condemned. \'Wherever possible, recoveries should be made of sums, PRid by federal agants in excess of, value received by the government., To this end there should be con, stituted a single joint committee of, congress, charged with the duty not, merely of bringing facts to light,, but of fastening responsibility for, both the blundering and the grafting, in governmental operations during, the past three or four years, and, providing the basis for punishing, the offenders. This committee should, procure the services of skilled at, torneys gifted in the art of investi, gators who know how to get at hid, den facts. It has taken a legisla, tive investigating committee in New, Tork assisted by such talent, only, two or three weeks to bring to, light, from a field far less fruitful,, facts which have staggered the peo, ple and have paved the way to a, cleaning up of a disgraceful and dan, gerous situation. It. would be a, crime to permit, the conditions which, are easily ascertainable at Washing, ton to have their echo only in cam, paign thunder., All this is written in no spirit of, partisan zeal. The Republican party, has been swept into power on the, crest of such a tiflay wave that fur, ther seeking for party advantage, would be a useless occupation. Here, is a simple question of patriotism, and of the public interest. The party, in power is responsible for certain, conditions which the people have in, a general way sensed and upon, which they have put the seal of their, condemnation. The party success, ful on November 2 has been com, missioned by the people, not merely, to assume national authority, but to, bring to book those who are respons, ible for the revolting orgy of waste, and downright theft which every citi, zen who has read the record knows, has been going on., We owe this much to the men who, gave their lives for the flag on the, battlefields of Europe. We owe it, to the mothers and fathers of these, boys. We owe to the millions who, saved and sacrificed during the war;, who bought war bonds without limit, and are now paying taxes without, limit to provide the money which in, many instances was spent with a, total disregard of the interests of, those from whom it has been taken., It is impossible to be complacent, in the face of the facts already, known relative to war waste, and, worse. Any man who can look the, facts in the face and not be stirred, by anger in behalf of the people, thus betrayed and imposed upon, or, who can fail to resolve that he will, do all within his power to prevent, the possibility of such a thing hap, pening again, is lacking in some of, the elements of true American loy, alty., Wie repeat: All of the hundreds, of scandals in connection with war, waste did not just happen. Some, thing more than mere incompetency, and stupidity, was involved. It is, the duty of the leadership entrusted, with power as the result of the elec, tion of November 2, to go to the, bottom in this matter, to lift sus, picion from every innocent individ, ual, and to fasten responsibility upon, every man who, when the house was, on fire, sought to loot, rather than, to save it., GOVERNMENT? CONCENTRATING, FOR ALASKAN DEVELOPMENT, The action of the war department, in appointing Col. Sherrill of the, United States army to represent that, department on the proposed interde, partmental Alaska commission, and, in recommending that other depart, ments of the executive branch of, the government do likewise, and in, suggesting that the various executive, departments have two sections of, the proposed interdepartmental com, mission, one section to be resident in, Alaska and one in Washington,, marks another very important step, toward the consummation of a plan, for co-operation and harmonization, on the part of those having charge, of federal governmental functioning, in Alaska., The war department plan would, contemplate the residence in Alaska, of officers of high rank represent, ing the various cabinet departments, which have federal functions to per, form in this territory, and to have, them function as a commission, co, operating all the time in the de, velopment of the territory. It is, evidently the purpose that these rep, resentatives of the various executive, departments of the government, should have the rank, or, at least,, the authority of assistant cabinet, members. Cabinet departments that, would be represented in such a com, mission would probably be the in, terior, the war, the commerce, the, postoffice, the agriculture, the jus, tice and the commerce, and possibly, the treasury, navy and . labor. All, these have important functions of, government to perform in Alaska in, connection with the federal re, sources and federal activities of, various sorts., Some such plan as this was sug, gested several years ago, and was, considered, at least, by then Secre, tary of the Interior Franklin K., Lane. Secretary Lane, howlever,, preferred the separate development, board plan. He thought the connec, tion between government in Alaska, and government authority at Wash, ington should be weakened rather, than strengthened; that the gov, ernment in Alaska should he separ, ated more from Washington and be, made more independent of Washing, ton in its operations., The first step toward the creation, of an interdepartmental commission, was taken by Secretary of the In, terior John Barton Payne last spring,, and it grew out of the agitation, regarding transportation problems in, Alaska. He asked for and secured, the co-operation of the departments, of commerce and postoffice, and the, commission headed by Dr. Alfred H., Brooks of the interior department,, with Assistant Postmastei\'-General, CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING, FOR RENT—THREE ROOM FURN, ished house.

After leaving Cordova, Mr., Young went over th trail to Fair, banks and then to Dawson and fin, ally up the MacMillan river. The, letter in part reads:, “On Aug. 10. I bid my folks, goodbye at Selkeit, they remaining, on the boat and I stopping off, among a few people and many In, dian dogs. My guide and Joe Brow, dee, my hunting companion, were, there to meet me and we were soon, loaded in a gas boat and on our way, to (he great game fields of the, MacMillan. Tt took six days to get, un the shallow stream, much of the, time poling our boat. On our first, day in campe we saw five sheep,, one moose and seventy-two caribou, so you see we were not going to, starve with all that game around., “The next day I went out to look, over the range and going out I, counted 102 caribou and 51 sheep but, did not see any large bulls or rams, that I wanted. The next day we, went over to the main sheep range, and saw many sheep. Located a, band of 12 rams not far from camp, but left them alone as it was late, in the evening when we found them., The third day we each got two nice, rams, our limit of sheep. The meat, was the finest in the land. We had, to wait several days for the moose, end caribou to begin rubbing the, velvet off their horns before we, could go hunting them.

The spread was i, not as wide as I wanted but the, head was so pretty that I decided to, take it. I saw plenty of moose and, killed one more bull. I killed five, caribou bulls and could have killed, many more. That is the easiest, country to hunt in that I have ever, seen, all kinds of moose and cari, bou and a fair supply of sheep., But not as many sheep as in the, White River countrq., There is no bear in that section, to speak of though we killed two, on the river from the boat as we, were going up.
