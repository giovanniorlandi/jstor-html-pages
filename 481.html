The experts of\ndomestic products of\nthe United States in the\nmonth of October, 1903\naveraged mere than\n$5,000,000 for every day in the month, and\nfor every business day in the month averaged\npractically $6,000,000 a day. The total ex ex\neorts of the months, as shown by the figures\nof the Department of Commerce and Laber\nthrough its Bureau of Statistics, amounted te\n$160,370,051), which "would average mere than\n$5,000,000 for every day in the month, and\npractically $6,000,000 for each business day in\nthe month. Frem the pert of New Yerk alone\nthe experts of the month were 851, SOT, 942, or\nnearly $2,000,000 for each business day of the\nmonth.\nThis exportation in October, amounting te\n$160,000,000, exceeds that of any preceding\nmonth in the history of our commerce, with the\nsingle exception of October, 1900, when the\ntotal was $163,3S9,6S0. Fer the ten months\nending with October the total experts were\n$1,149,694,933, and for the twelve months end\ning with October the total was $1,422,SS7,954.\nThese totals for ten and twelve months, re\nspectively, are larger than in any preceding\nyear, except 1901 and 1900, in which the ten\nand twelve months\' totals slightly exceeded\nthese of the present year.\nImports in October also exceeded these of\nany preceding October, with the single excep\ntion of October, 1902. They amounted te\n$81,931,005, or a little ever $2,500,000 per\n"day. The experts were, as already shown, ever\n$5,000,000 per day, thus leaving the average\ntotal excess of experts ever imports $2,500,000\nper day. The total excess of experts ever im\nports for the month of October was $78,439,\n054, or $2,530,292 for each day in the month,\nor $2,905,150 for each business day in the\nmonth.\nThe report further says\nOf this enormous total el $160,000,000 of experts, or\n$6,000,000 a day for each business day, the largest single\nitem was cotton, amounting te $00,000,000, while the re\nmaining $100,000,000 was divided among ether farm\nproducts, manufactures, the products of the mines, forests\nand fisheries. The high prices of cotton during the past\nfew months resulted in a reduction of purchases abroad\nin the earlier months of the year, and thus a shortage of\nstocks, and as a consequence the first month of the cotton\nyear, October, showed a very large exportation of cotton\nand at unusually high prices, the average price per\npound for cotton exported being 10.1 cents, against an\n\' average of 8.4 cents in October, 1902; 8.1 cents in October,\n1901; 9.9 cents in October, 1900, and 7 cents in October,\n1899.\n\' A comparison of October with the experts with these of\nOctober of earlier years illustrates the remarkable growth\nof our expert trade. In 1870 the October experts were\n$29,000,000; in 1880, $85,000,000; in 1890, $98,000,000,\nand in 900, $163,000,000, the largest experts for any sin\ngle month in the history of our commerce, and in 1903,\n$160,000,000, or mere than inany preceding month ex\ncept that of October, 1900.\nthe Veterans of the Civil War. President Roosevelt\'s Mes\nsage. That would sound better if Mr. Roeskvkli\npractised what he se glibly preaches. His\ninterest in the Veterans seems te be only "vote\ndeep."\nKentuckians generally will be apt te be\nlieve statements made by Commander Lucien\nYeung of the United States Navy, for the one\ngeed reason that Commander Yeung is a Ken\ntuckian whose record has shed luster en the\nNavy and en his state. Commander Yeung\nwas called a day or se since te tell the Senate\nConnnittee en Military Affairs what he knew\nof General Leenaud Weed\'s administration of\naffairs in Cuba. Mr. Yeung testified that his\nposition in Havana was of a double nature as\nCaptain of the Pert of Havana and Commander\nof the Naval Station at Havana. In the first\nposition he was under General Weed, but in\nthe latter was in no way subservient te the\nGeneral. He said he found himself being\nshadowed by detectives and, investigating, dis\ncovered they were working for General Weed.\nOther officers were subjected te like surveillance.\nUpen his recall General Weed expressed te\nhim surprise and regret. When he reached\nWashington he discovered that the recall had\nbeen upon representation and at the suggestion\nof General Weed himself. This comes dread\nfully near saying that the President\'s pet Gen\neral is a liar; and it\'s a leadpipe cinch that Com\nmander Yeung is prepared te back up his\nstatement.\nThe farther the\ninto the Cuban record\nSenate investigation gees\nof Governer General\nLeenard Weed, the deeper the President\'s pet\ngets into the mire.\nOne of the new witnesses before the Commit\ntee en Military Affairs was M . C. Fesnks, Inspec\ntor of Pests in Cuba, who said he had received\na letter from Judge Oktkz, President of the\nAudencia, which tried the postal cases, asking\nfor a translation of the Bristow report, for use\nin the prosecution.
