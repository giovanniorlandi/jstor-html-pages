        <pre>[' The Geographies of Protest \nand Public Space in Mid- \nNineteenth- Century London\nTh e Hyde Park Railings Aff air\nHannah Awcock, University of Hull\nabstract: On 23 July 1866 a protest took place in Hyde Park, London, which provides\na lens through which to analyze historical struggles over access to, and control \nof, public space. What began as a protest in favor of manhood suff rage became a \nconfl ict over the character and purpose of the park. It sparked public debates about \nwhich groups of people could access Hyde Park, and what activities were acceptable \nwithin it. Th ese debates raise questions about who was entitled to make such decisions\nand the impact of these decisions on London’s radical culture. Th is article uses \nnewspaper articles and parliamentary debates to explore the dispute that unfolded\nboth before and aft er the Hyde Park Railings Aff air. In doing so, it furthers our \nunderstanding of the geographies of protest and the ongoing negotiation of public \nspace.\nkeywords: protest, resistance, public space, urban, London, nineteenth century, parks\nIntroduction\nTh e availability of freely accessible public space in which to hold protests, \nmeetings, and rallies is an important resource for social movements and \nactivists. In recent years the increasing privatization and regulation of \npublic spaces has raised concerns over the character and health of public \nspace in cities.1 However, debates about access to, and control of, public \nspace are nothing new. Drawing on literature about public space and \nthe historical geographies of protest, this article looks at such confl icts \nthrough the lens of the Hyde Park Railings Aff air, a protest organized \nby the Reform League— a group established in 1865 to campaign for all- \nmale suff rage— that took place in Hyde Park in London on 23 July 1866.\nHyde Park is made up of 350 acres of land in Westminster in central\nLondon. It is one of London’s Royal Parks, owned by the Crown but \n', 'Awcock: Th e Hyde Park Railings Aff air 195\nplaced “in the care of the nation” by the monarch and managed by the \ngovernment.2 Th is situation has caused confusion in the past about who \nhad the right to control and police the park.3 Hyde Park was fi rst opened \nto the public by Charles I in 1637, and it has since become known as the \n“People’s Park.”4 As the nineteenth century progressed, rapid industrialization\nand urbanization led to increasing panic among the upper classes \nabout the physical and social condition of the working- class urban population.\nPublic parks were one of the most popular solutions, and by the \nend of the century most large urban areas had at least one.5 “Rational” \nrecreation, as well as the opportunity to mix with other classes, was seen \nas a method of social and moral improvement.6 Hyde Park predated this \nphenomenon, but it would still have been understood in these terms \nduring the nineteenth century.\nTh e awareness of the social, moral, and physical importance of accessible\nopen spaces contributed to confl ict over access to parks, commons, \nand other open spaces around Britain. Groups such as the Commons \nPreservation Society and Commons Protection League were founded to \nfi ght against enclosures and protect public access to open land.7 Examples\nthat have been subjected to historical analysis include Mousehold \nHeath on the outskirts of Norwich (1857– 84), Berkhamsted Common \nin Hertfordshire (1866– 70), Plumsted in Kent (1876), and Knole Park \nin Sevenoaks, Kent (1883– 85).8 Most relevant to this article is Anthony \nTaylor’s analysis of radicals’ struggles to access space for meeting and \norganizing in London between 1848 and 1880.9 Th is article builds on this \nwork by conducting an explicitly geographical analysis of the Hyde Park \nRailings Aff air, exploring the contested understandings of both public \nspace in London and Hyde Park as a place.\nOver the centuries Hyde Park has developed a symbolic association \nwith free speech and dissent. Until 1783 public executions in London \ntook place at Tyburn, at the corner of Hyde Park where Marble Arch now \nstands.10 Th e condemned were entitled to make a speech to the crowd \nbefore their execution; some of them used the opportunity to express a \npolitical opinion. Intended as a somber warning and deterrent against \nfuture crimes, the hangings were instead carnivalesque, a spectacle that \nentertained and fascinated the watching crowds. John Michael Roberts \nargues that “scaff old culture” left  its mark on Hyde Park, creating a \nlasting association between the park and moral, emotional, and public \nspeech; the “traces of the ‘last dying speeches’ had inscribed a form of \n', '196 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 47 · 2019\nplatform politics in the urban fabric of Hyde Park.”11 Roberts argues that \npolitical groups that used Hyde Park during the nineteenth century, \nincluding the Reform League, implicitly built on these “traces.” Th e \nfi rst large- scale demonstrations in the park took place in 1855, against \nthe unpopular Sunday Trading Laws. As such, the Reform League were \nboth drawing from and contributing to a developing radical tradition in \nthe park.\nIn critically analyzing the historical geographies of the Hyde \nPark Railings Aff air, this article utilizes two main sources. Th e fi rst is \nHansard, a largely verbatim report of the debates in both houses of the \nBritish Parliament, going back to the late eighteenth century. It allows us \nto analyze the opinions, arguments, and rhetoric of Britain’s politicians. \nTh e second source is newspapers. Th ese printed a variety of types of \ntext, including parliamentary debates, newspaper editorials, reports \nand “eyewitness accounts” of the demonstration itself, reports of other \nmeetings where the demonstration was discussed, open letters, and \nletters to the editor. Although the Hyde Park Railings Aff air took place \nin London, provincial newspapers followed events in the capital, and \nboth electoral reform and access to public space were national issues, so \nthe riots were discussed in many British newspapers. Like all historical \nsources, however, newspapers cannot be taken at face value: they are \n“gatekeepers and fi lterers of ideas.”12 Editors and journalists make \ndecisions about which stories are covered, and they shape how those \nstories are interpreted and received.13 In this way newspapers contribute \nto the (re)production of dominant political discourses. In relation \nto protest this oft en entails “delegitimization and marginalization of \nprotest groups that challenge established orders.”14 As such, newspapers \nneed to be used carefully and critically by researchers, particularly \nin the context of protests. In this case, the political leanings of all the \nnewspapers analyzed were considered in order to understand how they \nmight infl uence the coverage of the demonstration.\nTh e sources contain a wide range of arguments about holding demonstrations\nin Hyde Park, from a variety of actors, including the govern-\nment, the Metropolitan Police, opposition politicians, the demonstration’s\norganizers, political reformers, newspaper editors and journalists, \npolitical commentators, and members of the public. Admittedly, those \nwhose views are considered here were not representative of society as a \nwhole; they were the predominantly male elites who had enough social \n', 'Awcock: Th e Hyde Park Railings Aff air 197\nand political capital to publicize their opinions. It is widely acknowledged\nthat the voices and perspectives of those who participated in his-\ntorical protests and riots are largely absent from the archives, and the \nHyde Park Railings Aff air is no exception.15 In response to this issue, \nCarl Griffi  n advocates concentrating on how actions are perceived rather \nthan how they were intended.16 We cannot know why participants in the \nHyde Park Railings Aff air took part, and although the Reform League’s \npublic reasons for organizing the demonstration have been preserved, \nwe do not know if they were also the reasons that the committee gave in \nprivate. What we do have access to is how certain people responded to \nthe events of the Hyde Park Railings Aff air. As such, those responses are \nwhat are analyzed in this article.\nTh e rest of this article is made up of fi ve substantive sections. In the \nnext section I contextualize this research by considering the literature \non public space and the historical geographies of protest. Th e second \nsection describes what took place both before and during the Hyde Park \nRailings Aff air. Th e third section outlines the wide- ranging arguments \nmade about the suitability and acceptability of holding a demonstration \nin Hyde Park. Th e fourth section explores the role of social norms in \nthese debates, considering how normative defi nitions of acceptable behavior\nin the park were both utilized and negotiated by supporters and \nopponents of the Hyde Park Railings Aff air. Th e fi ft h section examines \nthe intersections of class, power, and geography in the aff air, by analyzing\narguments about who had the power to infl uence Hyde Park as a \nspace and which groups had a right to access it. Th e fi nal section off ers \nsome concluding comments.\nThe Historical Geography of Public Space and Protest\nFor many scholars, public space is an essential component of a functioning\ndemocracy.17 What public space actually is, however, is harder to pin \ndown. Public space can be defi ned as “space to which all citizens have a \nright of access.”18 Th is defi nition excludes noncitizens, however, such as \nvisitors and nonnaturalized migrants, and does not acknowledge that \nthis right is rarely absolute; it is oft en contingent on factors such as behavior\nand appearance. Th e right to access public space is not protected \nin law, and there is little legal diff erence between land that is publicly \nand privately owned. Th ere is a discursive diff erence, however; publicly \n', '198 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 47 · 2019\nowned space is understood to be distinctive.19 Setha M. Low has argued \nthat public space is socially constructed, produced through a combination\nof everyday use by diff erent groups and debates, both cooperative \nand competitive, about what the space represents.20 Don Mitchell has \nalso written extensively on the construction and contestation of public \nspace.21 He argues that public space is produced through the struggle \nbetween two confl icting understandings of its primary purpose: protest\nand debate, and relaxation and leisure.22 Mitchell’s work focuses on \nAmerica in the twentieth century, but as this article will demonstrate, \nconfl ict between these two contradictory understandings of public \nspace was also present in mid- nineteenth- century London.\nAnother aspect of Mitchell’s work that connects to the Hyde Parks \nRailings Aff air is his discussion of the control of space as a proxy for \nregulating free speech and dissent. Mitchell uses US Supreme Court \nrulings to argue that over the course of the twentieth century, protests \nwere increasingly controlled and limited through the regulation of \nspace. Rather than limit dissent itself, authorities placed increasingly \nstrict controls on where protest was tolerated, eff ectively limiting dissent \nwhile still being able to claim it was supported.23 Similar spatialized \ntactics of control were present in nineteenth- century Britain. Katrina \nNavickas explores the struggles of working- class radical movements in \nthe north of England to claim space in which to meet.24 Th e authorities \nrecognized that such movements would suff er if they could not access \nspace in which to meet and organize, so they employed numerous \ntactics to restrict working- class access to space. Like the US Supreme \nCourt, British authorities tried to control dissident voices by ensuring \nthey did not have access to spaces in which they could be heard.\nAnthony Taylor has argued that this confl ict was particularly tense \nin London for several reasons. One is that the expanding size of the \ncity made open land on the outskirts of London increasingly diffi  cult \nto access. Another factor was the presence of central government in \nWhitehall; the Metropolitan Police answered directly to the Home \nOffi  ce, and any challenge to authority in London was perceived as \na challenge to the government.25 Historian Lisa Keller’s work on the \nbalance between order and free speech in London and New York in the \nnineteenth century explores how this confl ict between the authorities \nand dissenting groups played out in the city’s public spaces.26 Th e \nsignifi cance of access to space for campaign groups helps explain why \n', 'Awcock: Th e Hyde Park Railings Aff air 199\ngroups such as the Reform League, whose primary concern was electoral \nreform, would divert their eff orts in order to campaign for the right to \nhold mass meetings in Hyde Park.\nIt is also important to recognize that Mitchell’s, Navickas’s, and \nTaylor’s work, as well as the historical geographies of protest more \ngenerally, engages with a broader argument made by Doreen Massey.27 \nMassey contends that space is inherently political, and that space is \npoliticized by its potential for change. For Massey, space is “always under \nconstruction,” produced by juxtapositions, connections, interactions, \nand relations. 28 It is worth emphasizing that this process is not always \namicable; space is oft en produced through antagonism, confl ict, and \nstruggle.29 Th e literature discussed here provide examples of space’s \ncontested potential, with confl icting interests vying for control over \nwhat space will become. As I shall illustrate, Hyde Park’s potential to be \nchanged, both physically and in terms of the rules and social norms that \ngoverned it, fueled the debate about the Hyde Park Railings Aff air.\nTh is paper will also build on Christina Parolin’s exploration of radical\ncultures in London between 1790 and c. 1845. Parolin argues that \nthe sites in which such radical politics occurred shaped the politics that \noccurred within them.30 Th is paper will extend this argument, drawing \non scholarship about contemporary protest to argue that radical politics \nalso shaped, and continues to shape, the spaces in which they occur.31 \nTh e argument that space, place, and protest are mutually constitutive is \nwidely accepted by geographers.32 For example, Sam Halvorsen’s work \non the 2011 Occupy movement in London explores how the protesters \nconstructed space but were also constrained by the spatial characteristics\nof the sites of their occupations.33 Mattias Wahlström argues that \nspace is constructed through confl ict between protesters and protest policing,\nhighlighting the importance of analyzing the perspectives of au-\nthorities and elites as well as protesters.34 Th is article explores how the \nmutual constitution of space through protest connects to debate around \nthe maintenance and contestation of public space.\nThe Hyde Park Railings Affair: \nA Struggle for Public Space\nParliamentary reform in Britain had been an important political issue \nsince the late eighteenth century. Th e 1832 Reform Act had reduced the \n', '200 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 47 · 2019\nnumber of rotten boroughs and enfranchised around 8 percent of the \nmale population, but for many this was not enough.35 Th e Chartists had \nsuff ered a fatal loss of momentum in 1848, but there were a number of \nother, more moderate groups that grew up in their place.36 In 1865 the \nReform League was established to campaign for universal male suff rage; \nthe barrister Edmond Beales was elected president.37 In 1866 the recently \nelected Liberal government proposed a bill that would reduce the property\nqualifi cation for voters from £10 to £7. Although falling far short of \nthe Reform League’s hopes, they gave it their support.38 Nevertheless, \nthe bill failed in early 1866, bringing the government down with it. In response,\nthe Reform League organized a demonstration in London, con-\nsisting of a march through the city before a rally in Hyde Park. Arranged \nfor 23 July, it would become known as the Hyde Park Railings Aff air.\nOn 17 July Richard Mayne, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police,\npublished a proclamation banning the Reform League’s rally. He ar-\ngued that the meeting was “inconsistent with the purposes for which the \npark is thrown open to and used by the public” and that “such an assemblage\nthere of large numbers of persons is calculated to lead to riotous \nand disorderly conduct, and to endanger the public peace.”39 Th e Reform\nLeague immediately questioned the legality of this ban. Edmond \nBeales wrote an open letter in reply, arguing that Mayne had no right \nto ban the demonstration.40 Th e executive committee of the League decided\nto challenge the ban by attempting to continue with the demon-\nstration as planned: marching to Hyde Park, demanding entry, and leaving\npeacefully if they were denied.41 Ironically, the ban only increased \nthe numbers and the determination of the marchers, heightening tensions\nand increasing the chance of violence.42\nOn the day of the demonstration the gates of Hyde Park were closed \nat 5 o’clock in the evening.43 On arriving at Marble Arch, Edmond Beales \nand other leading members of the Reform League advanced toward \nthe lines of police guarding the gates, requesting that they be allowed \ninto the park. When this request was refused, they retreated.44 Th e \nexecutive committee and some of the marchers continued to Trafalgar \nSquare where they held a peaceful rally.45 Despite the Reform League \ndistributing leafl ets urging protesters to proceed to Trafalgar Square if \nthey were denied entry and not to break into the park, a large number of \npeople remained behind and discovered that with relatively little eff ort \nthe cast- iron railings surrounding the park could be pulled down.46 In \n', 'Awcock: Th e Hyde Park Railings Aff air 201\nthis way protesters broke through the boundaries of the park at several \ndiff erent locations, including Marble Arch, Knightsbridge, Park Lane, \nand Bayswater Road.47 Th e police were unable to prevent protesters \nfrom entering the park from multiple directions. In the resulting clashes, \nprotesters used stones, fence posts, and other materials found within the \npark as weapons against the police. Th ere were injuries on both sides but \nno fatalities, and between forty and seventy protesters were arrested.48 It \nwas several days before the disturbances in the park subsided.\nAs Richard Mayne and Edmond Beale’s initial exchange demonstrates,\nthe debate about the ban and its validity was, from the very be-\nginning, based on confl icting understandings of what kinds of behavior \nwere appropriate in Hyde Park and who had the right to make such decisions.\nIt is to this theme that I shall now turn.\nThe Debate: Contested Understandings of Hyde Park\nTh e government and the Metropolitan Police clearly stated their argument\nagainst the Reform League holding a demonstration in Hyde Park. \nIt had two elements to it. Th e fi rst was that “such assemblages of men \nmeeting in Hyde Park might lead, and probably would lead, to riotous \nor disorderly conduct.” Th e second was that the demonstration “certainly\nwould interfere with the recreation of quiet and orderly people, \nfor whom the parks, the property of the Crown, are open, and not for \nthe purposes of such meetings.” Th is statement was made by the home \nsecretary, Spencer Walpole, in the House of Commons on 19 July. To \nWalpole the demonstration and the risk of violence that accompanied \nit was not in keeping with Hyde Park’s purpose, which was “the recreation\nof quiet and orderly people.” Walpole later stated that he hoped \nthe ban would “not be interpreted as being intended in the least degree \nto prevent the holding of ordinary public meetings for political discussion,\nbut simply for the preservation of the public peace.”49 Walpole was \nforeshadowing the arguments that the US Supreme Court would make \na century later by arguing that it was not the demonstration itself he opposed\nbut its location. Liberal authorities can use spatially selective re-\nstrictions to “silence dissident speech in the name of its promotion and \nregulation.”50 In this way they are able to simultaneously maintain order, \nsilence dissent, and retain their liberal credentials.\nTh ere were many who agreed with the home secretary and the gov-\n', '202 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 47 · 2019\nernment that the demonstration did not fi t with what they perceived \nas the purpose of the park: recreation. For example, an editorial in the \nLiverpool Mercury on 26 July stated, “A right to hold public meetings in \nthe parks for one purpose would imply a right to hold public meetings \nfor all purposes; and to admit such a right would be to spoil the parks \nas places of quiet recreation for quiet people.”51 Statements such as this \nhighlight Mitchell’s argument about the confl icting purposes of public \nspace: protest and peaceful recreation.52 To many social and political \nelites at the time, the two purposes were mutually exclusive. Th e Morning\nPost, a daily London newspaper whose coverage of the Hyde Park \nRailings Aff air was critical of the Reform League and their supporters, \nagreed that the demonstration was likely to cause violence: “Both in regards\nto its members and the characters of the individuals composing it, \nthe Reform meeting of Monday next would be much more likely to lead \nto disorder and a breach of the peace than to promote the objects with \nwhich that assemblage is to be convened.”53\nTh ose who supported the Reform League in holding the demonstration\nin Hyde Park objected to these arguments on several fronts. \nOne defense was that the disturbance of other park users caused by the \ndemonstration would be minimal. An editorial in the Daily News, for \nexample, argued that the park is big enough to accommodate multiple \nuses: “Twenty political meetings might be held all at once with all the \npomp and circumstance of banners and processions, and not one of her \nMAJESTY’s peaceful subjects be the wiser or the worse for it.”54 Th is \ncommentator was suggesting that Hyde Park could accommodate both \nof the confl icting purposes of public space, which implies that, for some \nat least, protest and recreation were not mutually exclusive activities.\nA more fundamental argument for the Reform League holding their \ndemonstration in the park was that not only was Hyde Park a suitable \nlocation for political demonstrations; it was actually much more suitable\nthan other locations. Holding a meeting in Hyde Park would cause \nmuch less disruption than in a busy street or square, for example. As the \nLeeds Mercury argued, “Hyde Park is a large open space.\xa0 .\xa0 .\xa0 . A public \nmeeting in this out- door open space would injure nobody, obstruct no \ntraffi  c, damage no property, do no harm in any way.”55 To defenders of \nthe right to protest in Hyde Park, these characteristics made it an ideal \nlocation for mass political meetings. Scholars of contemporary geogra-\n', 'Awcock: Th e Hyde Park Railings Aff air 203\nphies of protest argue that the physical landscape is an important factor\nin shaping how protest unfolds.56 In the case of Occupy London, the \nmain camp’s position next to a busy thoroughfare allowed activists to \nhave productive encounters with passers- by, giving them the opportunity\nto raise awareness of the issues they were protesting.57 Th e Reform \nLeague and other nineteenth- century radicals were similarly keen to exploit\nthe advantages off ered by the physical environment of Hyde Park.\nOpponents of the Reform League’s plan to hold a demonstration in \nHyde Park argued that there were plenty of other locations where such \na meeting could be held. For example, in an editorial published in the \nCaledonian Mercury (Edinburgh), the author argued that the right to \nprotest was not under threat:\nReform meetings have been held without hindrance on Primrose \nHill. Th e police would not dream of interfering with an open- air \nmeeting on Wormwood Scrubs, Hampstead Heath, or Clapham \nCommon, where there is ample space for as many thousands are \nas likely to assemble in support of Reform. Again, there are scores \nof halls in London in which public meetings might be held without\nthe smallest fear of hindrance from the police.58\nTh is was not how radicals and reformers saw the situation, however. \nIn an open letter to the Reform League, well- known radical John Bright \nencouraged Londoners to assert their right to meet in public, which was \nbeing limited from all sides: “To meet in the streets is inconvenient, and \nto meet in the parks is unlawful— this is the theory of the metropolis!”59 \nMason Jones, chairman of the Reform League, elaborated on this lack \nof opportunity for mass meetings in an open letter to Spencer Walpole:\nYou say you would not interfere with the meeting if it was held \nelsewhere; but I ask where are the masses of your unenfranchised \ncountrymen to meet? Nearly all the open spaces in the metropolis \nhave been enclosed.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. What is the use of admitting a right in the \nabstract, if you practically prevent the application of that right?\nIn the fi rst half of the nineteenth century, the government and social\nelites tried to suppress movements for reform and workers’ rights. \nAs previously discussed in relation to Katrina Navickas’s and Anthony \nTaylor’s work, one of the methods used to achieve this was limiting the \n', '204 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 47 · 2019\nopportunities for radicals and reformers to meet and speak in public.60 \nCampaign groups such as the Reform League struggled to fi nd spaces in \nwhich they could meet, an essential element in the reproduction of such \nmovements as it enabled groups to reach consensus, plan, boost morale, \nand recruit.61 For radicals such as John Bright and Mason Jones, the debate\nover the Reform League’s right to hold meetings in Hyde Park was \npart of a much wider struggle for popular movements to claim space.\nTh e issue of ownership was also contentious. Antonia Layard argues \nthat we should work within the discourses and structures of property to \nconstruct public spaces.62 Multiple groups used a language of ownership \nand legality in order to establish and justify their right to control Hyde \nPark as a public space. Th e government argued that Hyde Park belonged \nto the Crown, and as a result, the people had no inherent right to use it. \nIn a speech in the House of Commons on 24 July 1866, Spencer Walpole \nreferred to a legal report that the government had commissioned in the \nwake of the 1855 Sunday Trading Riots. Walpole quoted extensively from \nthe report, including the following: “Th e authority to close and exclude \nthe public from the Parks is that which every landowner has to prevent \nthe public from trespassing on his lands.”63 Th e Reform League’s supporters\nargued that the public did have an inherent right to access and \nuse the park.64 Some argued that the park did in fact belong to “the people”\nrather than the Crown.65 Th is argument was based on the fact that \nit was taxes, paid by the people, which funded the park’s upkeep. For \nexample, an editorial in Reynold’s Newspaper, a radical- leaning weekly \nnewspaper published in London, declared that Sir Richard Mayne was \nattempting to “prevent the people of London from assembling, for a \nlawful purpose, in one of their own places of public resort— in a place \nbelonging to the public, and paid for out of the public’s money.”66\nTh e debate over whether the Reform League had the right to hold a \nmass meeting in Hyde Park, and whether the government had a right \nto prevent such a meeting, was a complex one, with interwoven strands \nassociated with rights, legality, and ownership. Th e debate operated on \nseveral scales. Locally, it was a confl ict over how best to manage and \nuse an area of open space in the West End of London. On a larger scale, \nit was part of an ongoing struggle between the authorities, local elites, \nreformers, radicals, and popular movements over control of space, and \ntherefore the possibility of dissent, on a national level.\n', 'Awcock: Th e Hyde Park Railings Aff air 205\nThe Spatialized Negotiation of Social Norms\nTim Cresswell argues that places are used to enforce regimes of normative\nbehavior; people and activities are judged as “in place” or “out of \nplace” according to social norms. Diff erent places develop sets of unspoken\nrules that reinforce and complement offi  cial regulations about \nwhich behaviors and activities are acceptable.67 In the mid- nineteenth \ncentury these regimes were enforced within urban parks in a variety of \nways. Fences and gates were used to control access, and park keepers \npatrolled and cooperated with local police.68 Th e material fabric of parks \nwas also used to encourage normative behavior. For example, Avenham \nPark in Preston, Lancashire, was designed so visitors would always be \nvisible to other park users, encouraging good behavior through peer \npressure.69 Th ese processes were operating in Hyde Park in the mid- \nnineteenth century, as they do to this day. An editorial from the Morning\nPost on 26 July 1866 is an excellent example of these social norms in \naction:\nTh e Government\xa0 .\xa0 .\xa0 . conceive that they have the right of preventing\nmeetings for political purposes in the royal parks, just as \nthey have the right of prohibiting preaching, or cricket- playing, \nor many other things which they conceive to be out of place in \nthe grounds intended for the amusement and recreation of the \ncommunity.70\nTh is quotation is a clear illustration of how some activities were tolerated\nin Hyde Park, while others were considered inappropriate or “out \nof place.” Th e discourse of social norms was an important element in \nthe contestation of Hyde Park. Supporters of Mayne’s ban pointed out \nthat lots of activities were not tolerated in Hyde Park, and that political \ndemonstrations were banned in public parks across the country.71 Supporters\nof the Reform League called attention to other large, albeit less \npolitical, events that were held in Hyde Park on a regular basis. Th inking\nabout this mobilization of past behavior and regulations allows us \nto consider the role that social norms played in the ways in which Hyde \nPark was understood as a public space. Undoubtedly powerful regulators\nof behavior, social norms are open to interpretation and negotiation \nbecause they can be defi ed. Acting “out of place” suggests new interpretations\nof place, which can become established and create new social \n', '206 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 47 · 2019\nnorms.72 As such, they can be employed both by those trying to regulate \npublic space and those attempting to make new claims on it.\nIn the House of Lords on 24 July, the Liberal MP Earl Granville typifi\ned the practice of highlighting other banned activities. He argued that \nthere must be a legal justifi cation for banning the meetings, or the other \nrules in Hyde Park would also have no legal basis.73 Granville used all \nthe other activities that were restricted or not permitted to argue that \nthere must also be grounds for forbidding political demonstrations. Th e \nstatus quo was justifi ed because it was the status quo.\nAn extension of this reliance on rules and regulations was a fear that \nshould this one political demonstration be allowed, it would change \nthe way people used the park permanently. For example, in the House \nof Commons on 24 July, William Cowper- Temple, Liberal MP for \nHertford, said the following:\nSuch meetings had for some years been forbidden, because, if they \nwere once permitted, the Park would become the ordinary area \nfor the holding of such meetings, and the discussion of various \nsubjects.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. Th ere was not a temperance society that would not be \nwanting to expound its principles in Hyde Park, and the managers\nof school feasts would fi x upon the Parks as appropriate spots \nfor eating buns and drinking ginger- beer. Now this would materially\ninterfere with the ordinary enjoyment and recreation of the \npublic.74\nCowper- Temple was concerned that allowing political demonstrations\nin London’s parks would fundamentally alter their character for \nthe worse. A change in the literal rules that governed Hyde Park would \nresult in a shift  in the unspoken rules, or the social norms, that regulated\nbehavior in the park. In most spaces, protests and demonstrations \nare transgressive acts, because they defy the social and behavioral norms \nthat typically hold sway over a space. As such, they create the possibility \nfor change because they reveal those norms to be mutable; they are not \nfundamental laws that cannot be altered. Following Massey, I argue that \nthis mutability made Hyde Park a political space. For Cowper- Temple \nand other members of the political elite, this mutability was something \nto fear.\nOpponents of the ban were not necessarily trying to redefi ne the \nsocial norms that governed the park, however. Some argued that the \n', 'Awcock: Th e Hyde Park Railings Aff air 207\ndemonstration was consistent with the park’s unspoken rules. Th ey \nprovided examples of when Hyde Park had been used for other events \ninvolving large numbers of people, including reviews of volunteer soldiers,\nparades by foot guards, and even the Great Exhibition in 1850.75 \nYet none of these examples were overtly political events, which was what \nset them apart from the Reform League’s demonstration in the eyes of \nthe government and the Metropolitan Police. Rather than presenting \nthe demonstration as an attempt to change the rules and social norms \nthat governed Hyde Park, those who opposed Mayne’s ban tried to show \nthat the demonstration was in keeping with the status quo.\nTh is use of precedents and social norms to support confl icting viewpoints\ndemonstrates how subjective understandings of public space can \nbe. While social and behavioral norms can be powerful controls over \nwhat kinds of behavior are performed in diff erent spaces, they are mutable\nand open to constant (re)negotiation and alteration. Th eir unspo-\nken nature contributes to their mutability, and their lack of fi xed defi nition\nleaves them open to interpretation. As such, they can be utilized \ndiff erently by diff erent people and for diff erent purposes, as in the case \nof the Hyde Park Railings Aff air.\n“Invaded by a Miscellaneous Assortment of \nRadicals from Holborn and Clerkenwell”: \nThe Intersections of Class, Power, and Geography\nLondon’s geography is shot through with relations of power, class, and \ninequality,76 and has been since long before 1866.77 Londoners of different\nsocioeconomic groups had separate locales for work, accommo-\ndation, and recreation. As today, there were signifi cant cultural, social, \nand economic gaps between the city’s rich and poor.78 London’s parks, \nportrayed by social and political elites as spaces where diff erent social \nclasses could mingle and interact, reproduced those divisions.79 Th ese \npartitions, and their geographical manifestations, are clearly visible \nwithin the debate surrounding the Hyde Park Railings Aff air.\nFor many of those who supported the Reform League’s right to meet \nin Hyde Park, the issue was not just about having a location in which to \nmeet but also being able to meet in a place that would render them visible\nto those in power. Few working- class men, and no women, were able \nto vote in the 1860s, so attending a public meeting was one of the limited \n', '208 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 47 · 2019\noptions available for making one’s voice heard. Radical groups believed \nthat the closer this meeting was to the government’s seat of power in \nWestminster, and the wealthy people who lived in the West End around \nHyde Park, the harder it would be for elites to ignore their concerns. \nTh e Birmingham Daily Post published an account of a meeting of the \nBirmingham Working Men that took place two days aft er the protest on \n25 July, where they discussed the events in Hyde Park.80 In the months \nbefore the Hyde Park Railings Aff air, the political elite had asserted that \nthe working class did not want the vote, challenging groups such as the \nReform League to prove otherwise. Th is was part of the rationale behind\nthe planned demonstration, as Arthur O’Neill, who chaired the \nBirmingham Working Men meeting, asserted:\nHyde Park was surrounded by those classes that had been insulting\nthe people for the last several months; and therefore, it was \nnecessary that they should take their views and themselves, quietly \nand calmly, to look the gentry in the face— [cheers]— and show \nthem that the multitude of the working classes were for reform.81\nTh e Caledonian Mercury recognized that “Hyde Park, with its surrounding\ncity of palaces, appeals from its very position to class feel-\ning.”82 For reformers such as O’Neill, Hyde Park’s location close to the \nphysical and metaphorical seat of power in Britain, not just London, \nwas a factor in what made the park such a desirable location for political \ndemonstrations.\nTh is symbolic nature of Hyde Park’s location likely also contributed \nto the government’s decision to ban the demonstration. In the House \nof Commons on 24 July Henry Jervis, a Conservative MP, argued that \nthe purpose of holding a public meeting in Hyde Park was to intimidate \nMPs and therefore unfairly infl uence Parliament:\nTh e working men\xa0.\xa0 .\xa0 . wished to assemble in Hyde Park in order \nto let the people of the West End of the town know what they \nthought on the subject of Reform. Why, what was the meaning \nof this? Simply to endeavour to intimidate the Members of this \nHouse, most of whom lived at the West End. But hon. Members \nwere sent to the House of Commons to act on behalf of the people \nof England as a whole, and therefore he must protest against meetings\nbeing held for the purpose of intimidating country Members, \nand forcing them to act against their better judgement.83\n', 'Awcock: Th e Hyde Park Railings Aff air 209\nJervis’s concerns were an acknowledgment that Hyde Park’s symbolic \nsignifi cance depended on its proximity to both London’s wealthiest residents\nand Britain’s political center in Westminster.\nTh e geographical distributions of power and inequality in London \nalso played out through arguments about which groups of people were \ntolerated in Hyde Park and who had infl uence over how the park was \nmanaged. In the House of Commons on 24 July, Acton Smee Ayrton, \nLiberal MP for Tower Hamlets and staunch reformer, made a speech \nin favor of the people’s right to hold demonstrations in Hyde Park.84 \nAyrton argued that wealthy elites had appropriated certain sections of \nthe royal parks for their own convenience and recreation, including \nactivities that were not accessible to the majority of Londoners, such as \nriding in a carriage.85\nAyrton was not the only one that thought that the upper classes had \nmore power over how Hyde Park was managed and used than everyone \nelse. Th e Freeman’s Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser, published \nin Dublin, describes a satirical poster that appeared on London’s streets \naft er the Hyde Park Railings Aff air:\nWith the catching headline “Wanted!” [it] was a call for “10,000 \ncostermongers, mounted on their donkeys, to parade Rotten- row,” \nfor the purpose of testing “the question whether this portion of \nHyde Park belongs to a class or to the entire people.”86\nRotten Row was originally built to connect Saint James’s Palace and \nKensington Palace for the royal family, and it was a popular place for \nLondon’s rich and famous to ride by the mid- eighteenth century.87 As \nsuch, it was probably one of the areas of the park most strongly associated\nwith the upper classes in 1866 and would have been an appro-\npriate place to challenge perceived class- based exclusionary practices in \nthe park. Examples such as these demonstrate that the ability to access \nand infl uence Hyde Park as a public space was perceived as being differentiated\nby class. A wide range of socioeconomic factors, including \ngender, ethnicity, age, and income, can aff ect whether an individual feels \ncomfortable entering a particular public space, or indeed whether they \nare welcomed by other users of that space.88 As Anthony Taylor argues, \nparks “reinforced existing social divisions in London. Th e landscape \nof the parks was a controlled environment of winding paths and close- \ncropped fl ower borders that fulfi lled bourgeois fantasies of a tamed natural\nlandscape”; they did not cater to the recreational tastes of the work-\n', '210 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 47 · 2019\ning classes.89 London’s working classes may well have felt excluded from \nHyde Park because it was not designed for them. Th e debate surrounding\nthe Hyde Park Railings Aff air was an opportunity for these griev-\nances to be aired.\nTh is class- based exclusion also had a geographical dimension. \nWhether one had the right to access Hyde Park was not simply based on \nsocioeconomic status but also on which part of London one came from, \nas refl ected in this editorial in the right- wing Times on 24 July:\nParliament has endowed London with a number of these pleasure- \ngrounds; there is Hyde- park for the West- end, St. James’s Park for \nWestminster, Victoria and Greenwich Parks from the east and \nsouth- east of the metropolis, Regent’s Park for the north, and \nBattersea for the south. If political agitators really did wish to harangue\nin Parks, one would think they might be content to use \nthose which are nearest to them. But here we have the extremest \nregions of London placarded with invitations to the lowest class \nof their inhabitants to occupy a Park which is the ordinary place \nof recreation for the people living in the west of London. It is \nagainst all reason and justice that motley crowds from all parts of \nthe metropolis should take possession of Hyde Park, and interfere \nwith the enjoyment of those to whom the park more particularly \nbelongs.90\nTh e author stated in no uncertain terms that the “lowest class” of \nLondoners from other parts of the city were not welcome in a park that \n“particularly belongs” to the people who live in West London. As has already\nbeen noted, the areas surrounding Hyde Park were home to some \nof the city’s wealthiest and most powerful residents. London’s class divisions\nwere manifest in the city’s geography, and this in turn infl uenced \nunderstandings of who was welcome in Hyde Park and to whom it “belonged.”\nTh is illustrates how access to public space can be diff erentiated \ngeographically; where a person comes from can aff ect their right to enter\na particular public space.\nConclusions\nCreating a space that is truly public is not just about the ability to access \nsaid space but also about being able to infl uence which practices and be-\n', 'Awcock: Th e Hyde Park Railings Aff air 211\nhaviors are considered acceptable within it. As the example of the Hyde \nPark Railings Aff air demonstrates, obtaining the right to access and \ncontrol public space is a complicated process infl uenced by multiple factors\nincluding power, class, geography, and social norms. Public spaces \nand the social norms that dictate how they are used are malleable, open \nto interpretation, negotiation, and contestation. Th is means that public \nspace is not only a location for protest and acts of dissent; it can also be \nthe motivation for resistance. Protest is shaped by public space because \nof the rules and conditions that govern it; the Hyde Park Railings Aff air \nescalated into a riot because the government declared that mass meetings\nin the park were against the rules and tried to enforce that ruling. \nHowever, public space is in turn shaped by protest; debates around the \nHyde Park Railings Aff air were part of a longer conversation that eventually\nled to the foundation of Speaker’s Corner, a designated area for \nfree and political speeches that was created by the 1872 Parks Regulation \nAct.\nTh e debate about the Hyde Park Railings Aff air also illustrates how \npeople justify their claims over public space. A wide range of arguments\nwere utilized, including Hyde Park’s suitability as a location for \nmass meetings, ownership of the park, fi nancial contributions to the upkeep\nof the park through taxes, adherence to the preexisting rules, so-\ncial norms governing the park, and even proximity of one’s home to the \npark. Th is is signifi cant because it contributes to our understandings of \nwhy people feel they have a right to access and infl uence public space, \nand it can provide insight into contemporary confl icts over increasingly \nprivatized and regulated public spaces. Th e debates that played out in \nParliament and the British media in 1866 also highlight how confl icting\nunderstandings of the purpose of public space can fuel debate; ques-\ntions about whether public space is for protest and debate or leisure and \nrecreation resonate to this day. In this way, this article furthers our understanding\nof the geographies of public space and protest, both past \nand present.\nTh e Hyde Park Railings Aff air took place at a time when radical \nmovements had to fi ght the authorities for spaces in which to meet, \ndiscuss, and organize. With the increasing restrictions on public space \nand the rise of right- wing authoritarian governments around the world, \nmodern activists are facing a similar struggle. Th e right to access and infl\nuence public space is an important one, and it is by no means guaran-\n', '212 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 47 · 2019\nteed. By understanding how this right was both defended and contested \nin the past, we can contribute to the defense of that right in the present.\nAcknowledgments\nTh e research for this article was undertaken during my PhD at Royal \nHolloway, University of London, which was funded by the ESRC.
