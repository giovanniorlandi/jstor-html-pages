Dudley, former mayor of Liber\nal, old time railroad promoter,\nranchman, a philosopher and one of\nthe people who helped in a material\nway to make Liberal the capital city\nof the southwest, arrived from\nShreveport, Louisiana, last Saturday\nevening. -He traversed the entire dis\ntance, 915 miles, in his Maxwell and\ndid it in six days.\nThe trip is a record in that he is\n82 years of age and was his own\ndriver and mechanician and was\nalone. Says he encountered much\nmuddy roads, but in spite of that he\nmade an average of about 153 miles\nper day. He is enjoying health. He\nwent there a few months ago with\nthe idea of bettering his health and\nbe appears to have secured that\nwhich he sought. "Think I feel as,\ngood as any fellow my age ought to\nfeel," asserts Mr. Dudley, but he ad\nmits that he does not expect to live\nPANAMAS\n$6 and $6.50\nyou from 50c . to $1.00 on\nstyles, and remember you\nanother 82 years, notwithstanding\nhis present healthy condition.\nThe roads in Louisiana are fine,\nand as a general thing the people\nthere take pride in keeping the roads\nIn good shape. There are some good\nroads in Texas, but as he neared Ok\nlahoma and finally reached KanBas\nthe travel was not so smooth. Mr.\nDudley says that the trip was not at\ntended with any accident, not even\na tire was punctured.\nBANQUET FOR SUSS BEECUER\nThe local Endeavor Association\ngave a reception and banquet Tues\nday evening at the Christian church\nin honor of Miss Mary Beecher.

The talks were\nalong the line of what can be accom\nplished tor Liberal throughout the\nChamber of Commerce and were\nprofitable and inspiring as well as en\ntertaining. Mr. Bert Hobble spoke shortly on\n"How a Chamber of Commerce Could\nHave Benefited Liberal In the Past."\nHis principal Idea was that If we had\nhad a Chamber of Commerce In the\npast the men of the town would hare\nbeen educated to work together for\nthe good of Liberal and we would be\nin better position to get big things\nfor the town now. The speaker of\nfered many valuable suggestions\nalong the lines of what we need sow.\nAmong other things was the beauti\nfying of the streets and buildings,\nbetter schools, and a good auditori\num for the town meetings.\nMr. O. D. Nlchol spoke on "What\nbenefit I expect to derive from my\nmembership In the Chamber of Com\nmerce." He invited the business\nmen of the town and those Interest\ned in the Farmers\' Institute to attend\nthe next meeting of that organisa\ntion. He spoke of how much good\nroads were needed and the benefit\nthe people of the town and farmers\nalike would derive from them. He\nrecommended the Chamber of Com\nmerce as the place for the farmers\nand town people to get together and\nwork out the problems which mean\nso much to both.\nMr. Scheark made an interesting\ntalk telling of the construction and\nmaintenance of the new sewerage\nsystem now being installed. After\nhis talk several questions were asked\nand a general discussion was held\nwhich proved very beneficial to the\nentire meeting.\nMr. W. H. Graves gave a very in\nteresting and entertaining talk on\n"Why a man should Join the Cham\nber of Commerce." His talk fol\nlowed the lines that It you do not\nwant your business to amount to any\nthing you do not boost it and the\nsame thing applies to your town. His\nidea was It you want your business\nto grow and develop you advertise It\nand push It and that is what Is neces\nsary to do with your town.\nMr. H. A. Gasklll talked on "What\'\nthe Chamber of Commerce can do for\nLiberal In the future." His talk was\nmade up of suggestions of the things\nwhich can be accomplished for the\ntown. He gave the Idea that we have\na good town and a good place to live\nand now what we want Is a better\ntown and a better place to live.\nThere are many things which we can\ndo to held our town and now Is the\ntime to start to do them.\nThe big thing which the meeting\naccomplished was to get before the\nmembers the number of things that\ncan be accomplished by the members\nworking together for the good of Lib\neral. These things were Hated and it\nis the purpose of the organization to\ntake each one up at the proper time\nand work for everything that is for\nthe good of the town and surround\ning country.', 'THB DEMOCRAT, JUBEKAU KANSAS\nF\n"HaiTimes,,\nTane: ( Msi Corn Were in the Crib.)\nYou sweat and labor in the field\nTo make your land a crop to yield-\nYou work with great endurance,\nBut all your chance for profit fails\nIf on your growing crop it hails\nAnd you\'re without Insurance.\nDon\'t wait until the Hail stones fall\nBefore you heed the agent\'s call\nAvoid procrastination.\nWhen once the storm begins to blow\nYour harvest from the crops you sow\nIs grief and desolation.\nWhy risk losing the fruits of your toil when you can\ninsure your growing crops against loss and damage from\nHail in the "Columbia Fire Underwriters" Liberal con\ntract Lowest rates for sound indemnity.

FARMING AS A BUSINESS\nThe principles which underlie-\nprontaDie iarming are not nniiK\nthose which underlie the profitable.\nconduct of any other business. The--one\nfundamental principle underly--lng\nall successful business undertak\nings is that the cost must be less.\n,U.H n 1 1 1 n. nl T tit n\nmail lua bchiub yiito. iu kuo viola\ntion of this principle agriculture is\nno exception. Farming, however, is.\nsuch a complex business, and the dif\nferent enterprises making up th\nfarm unit are so Intricately related,\nthat it is often, well-nigh impossible -to\ndetermine the true cost or the-,\ntrue selling price of a farm product.\nHowever, the relation of any factor\nin farming to the profits ot the farm,\nas a whole, by the study of a larg\ngroup ot farms, can be fairly accur\nately determined.

Barnes, live stock specialist of the\nUniversity of Arizona agricultural ex\ntension service, says:\n"If you have studied hog conditions\nIn the United States you will find that\nabout four pigs per litter Is the aver\nage; and I can point to you men In\nArizona who are actually raising for\nmarket two and three pigs to the lit-\nWell-Developed Sow With Profitable\nLitter.\nter, yet the cost of maintenance of\nthe brood sow is practically the same\nwhether she brings two pigs or ten\npigs per litter, which means that the\nfarmers are losing a large percentage\nof profit by keeping such brood sows\nIn their heroo.\n"There are several reasons why\nbrood sows bring small litters, and I\nfirmly believe that the one which con\ntributes to the trouble more than any\nother is the practice ot breeding sows\ntoo young. It is no uncommon filing\nto find sows weighing less than one\nhundred pounds with pigs. Usually\nyou find them with only two pigs. The\nyoung sows which you intend to keep\nfor brood sows should never be bred\nunder nine months of age, and it Is\nmuch better to wait until they are\ntwelve or fourteen months old. Then\nif they are not\' full developed, wait a\nfew months longer. Your brood sow\nis good for six or eight years, and, if\nby waiting a few months in the be\nginning before starting her on her life\nwork, you can Increase the size ot her\nlitters, you have certainly made good\nwages for those months. Another\nthing which contributes to no slight\nextent to cause small litters Is the\nlack of exercise.\nWEANLING PIGS GROW FAST\nGreatest Gains for Feed Consumed\nAre Made In Early Life Lard\nHogs Becoming Unpopular.\nThe prevalent opinion seems to be\nthat swine were designed to eat up\nthe corn crop and grow Into 300\npound porkers. Under certain cir\ncumstances there Is a better profit In\nselling weanlings than In feeding\nthem up to the usual market weights.\nExact trials at many experiment\nstations show that the greatest gains\nfor feed consumed are made in earlv\nlife and that as the animals grow old\ner it takes more feed to produce a\npound of pork.\nThe suckine Die stows verv fat\nand converts nearly all of its rations\ninto meat. If the sow is fed liberally\nshe. too. will make some tains while\nsupporting her brood. The weanling\nweighing 25 to 40 pounds Is almost\nclear gain and will often bring ten\ncents a pound at this age.\nOn the same principle the 150-pound\npig will make more profitable re\nturns on feed consumed than If left\nuntil it weighs 250 pounds. There is\nan Increasing number of farmers who\nprefer to sell light "bacon hogs" and\nfewer who continue to feed "lard\nhogs" up to the extra fat classes that\nwere popular a score of years ago.\nGOOD VENTILATION FOR HOGS\nFrequently When Shed Is Closed Ani\nmals Become Heated and Must\nInhale Impure Air.\nOf little less Importance than the\nventilation of this year\'s crop of corn\nis that of securing proper ventilation\nfor the animals that eat it, according\nto the Nebraska College of Agricul\nture. This Is particularly true ot\nhogs.\nFrequently when the shed Is closed\ntightly the hogs will become heat\ned, as well as be obliged to Inhale\nImpure air. Such hogs, on being ex\nposed to cold air, are likely to be\ncome susceptible to disease, espe\ncially pneumonia and so-called hog\nrheumatism.\nNoose vs. Halter.\nA rope with a noose In It Is some\nwhat cheaper to tie an animal with\nthau a good halter, but if the noose\nhappens to slip, or the animal gets\nInto some unusual position which\ndraws the rope tight enough to choke\nthe animal to death, the halter proves\nSee MATK1N BROS.\nFOR INSURANCE OF ALL KINDS\nREPRESENTING THE\nAmerican Insurance Co.\nOF NEWARK, NEW JERSEY\nAssets, $10,248,041,49 Wheat insurance a specialty.

They were not \' agitators.\nTheir "voices were not heard in the\nmarket places, sounding the call of\nbattle. They symbolized the nation\'\nlove of peace; yet when circum\nstances forced the issue, they did not\nshirk responsibility.\nPresident Wilson, too, is a man of\npeace. "Valor," said the President,\nin his speech to the Gridiron Club, in\nFebruary, 1916, "la self-respecting.\nValor is circumspect. Valor strikes\nonly when it is right to strike.

Those behind you,\nnot being on business, are probably\nIn no hurry.\nHaving taken your seat, It Is not a\nbad idea to move from side to side\nas much as possible. After working\nall day you need a little exercise, and\nthose behind you will certainly not\ntake any the less interest in the pic\ntures. The atmosphere of a crowded plc\nturedrome is frequently rather close.\nThe air may be" kept in motion In\nyour vicinity If you sit as high in\nyour seat as possible and move your\nbody from side to side. This will\ncause the people In the rows behind\nto lean in the opposite direction, thus\ncausing farther motion of the air.\nIt you are a "perfect lady," keep\nyour bat on until you are comfort\nably seated, especially if you are\nwearing a very handsome one. This\nkindly consideration will keep you\npoor sisters behind In a pleasurable\nfever of anticipation until lights go\nup again. Then let them have a good\nInspection of your millinery, which\nyou can do by not commencing to re\nmove your hatpins until the next\npicture Starts.\nWomen should wear their own\nhair (or. other people\'s) as high as\npossible, and It should also project\non either side. There Is nothing\nthat sets off a shapely head so well\nas luxurious hair. The people in the\nrear seats will admire the effect im\nmensely. Women should always bring their\nbabies with them. If you do not\npossess one borrow one or two from\na neighbor; Any picturedrome man\nager will tell you that "child inter\nest" adds enormously to the success\nof most pictures.\nAlways drop chocolate creams on\nthe floor. Of course, they will be\nsquashed under someone\'s clumsy\nfoot, but this waste is more than\n-counterbalanced by the extra work\nIt provides for the cleaners, who\nmight be discharged If there was not\nmuch fcr them to do.\nAs the prominent players appear\non the screen do not fail to announce\nwhat Other important films you have\nseen them In, and give any details\nyou may have learned of their priv\nate lives. There may be people sit\nting near you not quite so well in\nformed as you are.\nAnd finally, always leave In the\nmiddle of a reel. People in general\nare wonderfully" good-natured, and\nIt is extremely unlike that any of\nthose in the same row who have to\nstand to let you pass will swear at\nyou, while those in the rear seats,\nwhose view you have obstructed, will\ngladly wait till the picture comes\nround again in order to see it all.\nFrom Answers, London.\nTHE RIGHT WAY TO READ WAR\n.\'NEWS\nHere are a tew suggestions which\nmay help you to read with better un\nderstanding the fearful and wonder\nful war news sent across the water to\nus dally. .\nWhen you see a dispatch begin\nning, "a returned neutral, whose\nname cannot be mentioned," and\ndated somewhere In Switzerland, you\ncan safely set It down for the inven\ntion of a needy penny-a-llner who\nwants the price ot a meal. -\nWhen you see a dispatch that pur\nports to give the conversations and\nplans agreed upon at a meeting of\neither the. French, German, British\nor Italian army staffs, you can set it\ndown as a pure fake. The crowned\nheads and militray chiefs of Europe\nare not In the habit of confidentially\nrelating their1 secret conversations\nand military plans to newspaper cor\nrespondents located in Holland, Den\nmark or Switzerland, Italy or any\nohter neutral or hostile country.\nWhen you see a dispatch asserting\nthat "we inflicted enormous loss up\non our enemies with no losses to our\nselves," you can safely disbelieve it.\nWhen two armies fight under modern\nconditions both get hurt.\nWhen you see a dispatch saying\nI that "during the night, after success\nfully repulsing the enemy, we with\ndrew to a better position, previously\nprepared," you\' can make up your\nmind that somebody has had a lick\ning and is putting as good a face as\npossible on the defeat.\nWhen you read that "our gallant\narmy Is only waiting the proper sig\nnal to begin the long-heralded offen\nsive which will finally smash the\nfoe," you can make up your mind\nthat a gallant correspondent Is writ\ning against time and space.\n-When you see a dispatch dated\nBerlin via London, or Athens via\nRome, or Copenhagen via Geneva,\nrecollect that you are reading stuff\nwhich has no definite origin and is\nworth no more and no less than a\ndispatch from Pekin, China, via\nPodunk, Indiana. .\nIf you want to know how the war\nis really going pay attention to the\nlocalities mentioned In the official\ndispatches, and by aid of your maps\nyou can .easily decide which forces\nare advancing and which are being\npushed back. And when all is said\nand done, it is always the more pow\nerful and victorious armies which\nadvance and the weaker and defeated\narmies which fall back.\nThat is the acid test of warfare\nand its results.

The\nDepartment of Commerce has Just\nIssued a statement that the export\not munitions in 19 months was\n$340,000,000. The total exports of\nthe country are more than 10 times\nthat in 12 months.

It Is es\ntimated that about 2,609 different chik\ndren visited and made use of the play\ngrounds during this period.\nThat ought to give the people of the\ncommunity a clearer Idea than they\nhave heretofore possessed of the Im\nmense value of the playground sys\ntem and of the effectiveness of the\nsystem as it Is being applied In\nCharleston. Probably a majority of\nthe Charleston readers of this news-\'\npaper have not been aware all this-\ntime of the Importance which the few\nplaygrounds now available have as\nsumed as a factor In the life of the\nchildren of Charleston.
