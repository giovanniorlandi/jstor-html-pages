        <pre>["lit-re’s a suggestive fact, worth thinking over: Every one of The Booster’s steady advertisers is making money and is a successful business man. Isn t\njt peculiar, to say the least, that the business men you hear “hollering” about hard times and poor trade are only those who do not advertise? Isn’t it?\nThe Marble Booster\nBY FRANK P. FROST\nGlenwood Physician Shoots\nHimself and Two Daughters\n[special to the booster]\nGlenwood Springs, July 22. —The worst\ntragedy in the history of Glenwood took\nplace here Tuesday night when Dr. T.\nL. Hutchison, the well known eye\nspecialist, shot and killed his two\ndaughters— Lois, aged 12, and Fay,\na r cd 9 and then killed himself. The\ns! looting took place about 8:30 o'clock\nin the offices of Dr. Hutchison in the\nCitizens National bank building.\nDr. Hutchison had been estranged\nfrom his wife, the mother of the two\nlittle girls, for about three weeks. A\nshort while after Strawberry Day they\nparted and Mrs. Hutchison went to the\nHotel Glenwood to stay, where she has\nbeen ever since, most of the time un\nder the care of a physician. The Doc\ntor had made several attempts to be\nreconciled with his wife and once she\npromised to go back to him but she\ndidn’t do it. Tuesday he was in Rifle\non a business trip and when he return\ned to Glenwood he went to the hotel to\nmake another effort to get Mrs. Hutch\nison to return home with him. When\nshe refused to go he made a threat that\nhe was going to do something dreadful.\nIt is now thought, in the light of what\nafterward happened, that he intended\nto shoot his wife, but the presence of\nothers in the room kept him from his\npurpose.\nThe Doctor went across to his offices\nwhere his two little girls were waiting\nfor him. To the oldest, Lois, he gave\nfour nickels, presumably to pay her\nand her sister’s way to the picture\nshow, while he, himself, had promised\nto attend a lecture at the Methodist\nchurch. After giving Lois the money\nhe evidently made up his mind to kill\nboth of the girls and himself, for when\nthe body of Lois was found she was\nsitting straight up in the chair, with\nthe money clasped tightly in her hand.\nDeath had resulted instantly from a\nshot through the heart.\nThe other little girl, Fay, started to\nrun when her father shot Lois, but she\nhad not time to reach the door of the\noffices before the revolver spoke again\nand a shot pierced her heart. With a\nscream, “O, papa, please don’t kill\nme,” she fell headlong down the stair\nway and into the arms of C. C. Canna\ndy, who happened to be passing along\nthe street. She was immediately plac\ned in a passing motor car and hurried\nto the hospital but died on the way.\nWhen the door of the Doctor’s offices\nwas broken open he was found lying on\nthe floor, stone dead, with a bullet in\nhis brain, while blood was smeared over\nthe radiator in the room, and the body\nof his oldest daughter wa$ stark and\nrigid in a chair where she had instant\nly died.\nThe coroner decided no inquest was\nnecessary. The condition of Mrs.\nHutchison is very serious.\nMany Marble people who knew both\nDr. Hutchison and his bright children\njoin with The Booster in expressions of\nthe keenest regret over this terrible\ntragedy.\nSHORT NEWS NOTES OF\nTHE BIG C. Y. M. PLANT\nAn order was received this week\nfrom Batterson & Eisle, the largest in\nterior marble firm in Greater New\nYork, for the interior of the Widener\nMemorial at Cambridge, Mass., which\nwill be a very beautiful piece of work\nwhen completed.\nTwo cars of slabs are being shipped\neach week to the Musto Sons-Keenan\ncompany at Los Angeles for use in the\nnew Citizens National bank building\nthere.\nThe new steam yard crane which ar\nrived last week was put in service the\nmiddle of this week and is now busy\neach day moving marble blocks to\nplaces outside the range of the electric\ncranes. This steam crane, which runs\non its own motive power, will allow the\nstorage marble blocks at points\nwhere they will not incommode the\npresent yard capacity.\nThe slide wall grows each day. Snow\nslides are never going to threaten the\nmill again. The wall that is being built\nwould hold the entire mountain if it\nslid down on the mill.\nMARBLE, GUNNISON COUNTY, COLORADO, SATURDAY, JULY 25, 1914\nA Winter Scene in Marble, Colorado\nShowing Some of the Cottages Occupied By Workmen of the Colorado-Yule Marble Company\nGETTING INTO BIG WORK\nOF LINCOLN MEMORIAL\nThe C. Y. M. company is now get\nting into the big work of the Lincoln\nMemorial and the blocks that are re\nquired are monsters. A visit to the mill\nthe first of this week revealed in Shops\n3 and 4 something like a hundred pieces\nbeing finished, not one of which would\nweigh less than eighteen tons when\nready for the boxing. These are some\nsizable pieces of marble, believe The\nBooster.\nThirty-eight pieces weighing a trifle\nmore than eighteen tons each were be\ning made for the column bases. There\nare to be more than 600 blocks in the\ncomplete job that will weigh from\neighteen to twenty-two tons each.\nWhere is there another marble quarry,\ndo you think, that can furnish white\nmarble in such sizes?\nLincoln Memorial shipments are now\naveraging a car a day from Shop 3 and\ntwo and a half cars a week from Shop\n4. The fluting machines and upright\nlathes in Shop 4 are being fitted for\nservice this week with new parts got\nten from the Fred R. Patch company,\nthe,new drum saw is about ready for\nwork, and by the time the next Boost\ner is out the chances are that Shop 4\nwill be working on the column drums of\nthe Memorial. Blocks for this part of\nthe work are now accumulating near\nthe drum saw, ready for use when de\nsired, and the 4-strand wire saw adjoin\ning Shop 4 on the east is turning out\nthese blocks with great speed.\nG. B. TAYLOR GOES FOR\nHEARING WITH ASSESSOR\nGeorge B. Taylor, assistant general\nmanager of the Colorado-Yule compa\nny, went over to Gunnison the first of\nthis week where he spent a couple of\ndays presenting facts to the county as\nsessor in support of the company’s con\ntention that its assessments are incon\nsistent and exhorbitant when compared\nwith others. Later on the same points\nprobably will be argued before the\ncounty board of equalization. The com\npany believes the time has come to stop\npaying taxes that are in many instances\nfive and ten times as much as others\npay for property exactly similar in\ncharacter. Mr. Taylor has spent con\nsiderable time obtaining and correla\nting data to prove his assertions and he\nappeared before the assessor armed\nwith absolute proof of the facts.\nMr. and Mrs. “Billy” Higgins wel\ncomed a 9-pound baby boy at their home\nWednesday night. Dr. Stephenson was\nin attendance and mother and son are\nboth doing well.\nDenver Bank to be Built of\nOur Colorado- Yule Marble\nW. B. Berger, cashier of the Colora\ndo National bank of Denver, accompa\nnied by Mrs. Berger, visited Marble\nthis week with reference to the new\nj building the bank is to put up at Sev\nenteenth and .Champa streets in Den\nver and which will be constructed en\ntirely of Colorado-Yule marble. A block\nof frame buildings now on the site are\nbeing razed this week and foundations\nstarted for the big marble building.\nThe Colorado National batik building\nwill be one of the most beautiful struc\ntures of its kind in the West. Construc\ntion of the building has been started at\nthis time because of the great improve\nment in general business conditions\nwhich is taking place through the West,\nand according to Harold Kountze, pres\nident of the bank, the work will have\nto be rushed in order that the improved\nbanking facilities can be taken advan\ntage of before the bank has complete\n| ly outgrown its present quarters at\nSeventeenth and Larimer streets.\nFor the present the building will be\nbut four stories high, but in preparing\nthe plans W. A. and A. E. Fisher, the\narchitects, provided for a fourteen-story\nbuilding.\nThe entire structure will be of Colo\nrado-Yule marble, which is known to\nbe the best in the country, steel and\nconcrete. There will not be a single ar\nticle that can burn, put into the build\ning. The building will occupy the four\nlots on the west corner of the street in\ntersection which for many years have\nbeen occupied by one-story stores. The\nwork of tearing down the stores was\nstarted two days ago and within a few\ndays they will have been leveled to the\nground and the excavations started.\nThe new building will have two base\nments, the lower one of which will be\nused for general purposes. The upper\nbasement will contain the vaults of the\nbank which will be the most modern in\nthe West. The vaults will sit on con\ncrete pedestals and be surrounded by\npassage ways which will leave any part\nof them accessible to the watchmen.\nAn arrangement of mirrors and electric\nlights will be placed underneath the\nvaults so that watchmen can see under\nthem at any time.\nThe main entrance to the bank will\nbe in Seventeenth street through large\nbronze doors. The officers’ private of\nfices will be on both sides of the lobby\nin the front of the building while the\nteller’s cages will be on the sides and\nto the rear. The floors will be of tile.\nCity scales are being installed this\nweek on Main street, adjacent to the\nFaussone theater. Mrs. Joe Hall will\nbe named as weighmaster, The Boost\ner understands.\nBALKS AT ALTAR AND IS\nLEFT WITHOUT FUNDS\nThe following dispatch appeared in\nthe Denver Post of July 17 and con\ncerns a Marble girl and her matrimo\nnial adventures:\nBoulder Colo., July 17:—Bad luck at\ntended the matrimonial ventures of\nChrist Ruffner of Longmont, who ad\nvertised last month in a Denver paper\nfor a wife. The advertisement was an\nswered by Edna Lytle of Marble, in\nGunnison county, and an appointment\nwas made for a meeting in Denver.\nWhen the girl saw Ruffner, June 24,\nshe ch&nged her mind and returned to\nher home in Marble.\nNothing daunted, Ruffner again laid\nseige to her heart and persuaded her\nto come to Boulder to wed him. They\nmet in Longmont yesterday afternoon,\ncame to Boulder, procured a marriage\nlicense last night and, at the last mo\nment, when they were standing before\na justice of the peace, Miss Lytle again\nchanged her mind and refused to go on\nwith the ceremony. She collapsed and\nbegan to weep hysterically. Ruffner\nwas obliged to return to Longmont with\nout his bride. She is now at a rooming\nhouse in this city, without money to re\nturn to Marble. Ruffner, who paid her\nfare from Marble to Denver and re\nturn the first time and to Boulder yes\nterday, says he has no funds left and\nhas abandoned the girl to her own re\nsources.\nMANAGER FAUSSONE GIVES\nPATRONS A FEATURE FILM\nManager Faussone of the local pic\nture theater has concluded to put into\neffect a plan whereby once a month or\nmore often his patrons may enjoy a\nfeature film—something unusually good\nin five or six reels—and the first of\nthese features was shown Wednesday\nnight to a large crowd. The title of\nthe picture was “Victory,” and it de\npicts the U. S. navy and U. S. mar\nines in a thrilling story with battles on\nland and sea and in the air. The pic\ntures were good and the patrons of the\ntheater will await the next of the ser\nies with great interest.\nWEALTHY CARBONDALE\nWOMAN DROPS DEAD\nInformation reached here Wednesday\nof the sudden death at Carbondale of\nMrs. M. J. Francis, one of the most\nprominent land owners of that vicinity.\nMrs. Francis dropped dead at the din\nner table in her home. She was wealthy.\nTom Cooper hooked a trout at the\nsmelter bridge Wednesday that he\ncouldn’t land and for more than an\nhour he held the fish while about half\nthe town gathered to offer advice. Af\nter the long fight the trout finally got\naway. There are several persons, in\ncluding Cooper, who swear the fish was\nabout three feet long.\nVOLUME 4; NUMBER 20\nSystem Makes Efficiency in\nColorado- Yule Management\n[The following excellent article is by\nP. W. Lincoln, superintendent of the\nC. Y. M. in Shops 1 and 2.]\nThe several individual steps in the\nbusiness of marble fabrication have\nbeen so ably discussed in previous is\nsues of The Booster, it might be of in\nterest to your readers to learn some\nthing of the great importance of the\nperfect unity which must exist between\nthese several departments in order to\nsecure the best results.\nEspecially is this true in a coporation\nthe size of the Colorado-Yule Marble\ncompany and one so peculiarly situated,\nfor, with its system of sales offices,\ncovering, as they do, all sections of the\nUnited States, great care must be ob\nserved to prevent overselling and thus\ncongesting the manufacturing end of\nthe business, causing failure to live up\nto the terms of delivery, dissatisfac\ntion upon the part of the architect and\nowner, and increased cost of production\nto the company. At the other extreme\nequal care must be taken to see that\nthere is business enough booked ahead\nto keep the mills running on a steady\n1 schedule and so obviate lost time on\nthe part of the employees, who, living\nas they do in a town where practically\nthe only employment open to them is in\nthe mills or quarries of the company,\nare entirely dependent upon it for their\nlivelihood, which, failing them, will\ncause removals to other localities offer\ning steady employment. This, in turn,\ncauses a scarcity of labor and pecuniary\nloss to the company through idle ma\nchinery and increased overhead expense\nin proportion to gross production.\nThe conditions are overcome by a\nruling that all contracts be taken sub\nject to approval by the president of the\ncompany, who is at all times in touch\nwith conditions in both the selling and\nthe producing ends of the business and\ncan therefore pass intelligently on the\nacceptance or rejection of a contract\nwhen it is offered.\nSimilarly, the different branches of\nthe fabricating end of the business\nmust be in complete harmony with one\nanother, for let one department lag in\nits output for only one day, through\nbreakdown of machinery, lack of labor\nor any cause, and the resulting confu\nsion in that branch is smoothed only\nafter several days time, while the de\npartments depending upon the output\ni of this unit are running behind their\nnormal output and at an increased cost.\nPerhaps no one thing is productive of\nmore good or help in straightening out\nthese tangles than are the monthly con\nferences of the operating committee of\nthe company, when the previous month’s\nbusiness is reviewed in detail, errors of\nomission and commission pointed out,\nand plans discussed to guard against\nthe recurrence in ensuing months. Sug\ngestions are offered by any member for\nimprovements that may be made in his\ndepartment or that of another, and a\nmethod of procedure outlined for con\nducting the business of the current\nmonth whereby the greatest amount of\nwork may be turned out at a cost as\nlow as is consistent with good work\nmanship.\nIt is notably true in this business\n| that “the chain is as strong as its\ni weakest link,” and let there be but\none weak link in the organization of\nthe producing departments and disor\n‘ ganization will soon follow in the\n; stronger links, and so from the quarry\n| ing through the sawing, coping, rub\n1 bing, polishing, cutting, boxing and\nshipping departments eternal vigilance\n1 is the price of success. Machinery\nmust be carefully watched for evidences\nj of weakness and repair parts made or\nbought before actual breakdowns oc\ni cur; supplies for the different depart\nments ordered far enough ahead to\n; prevent shortage of any article, and\nthe health and welfare of the employ\nees looked after to prevent epidemics\nand the resultant shortage of labor.\nThe Colorado-Yule Marble company\nis fortunate in having these details un\nder the eyes of experienced and pains\ntaking executors, so that the possibili\nties of a serious setback are reduced to\na minimum and the outlook for a long\nperiod of prosperity is the brightest in\nthe history of the company.", "THE MARBLE BOOSTER\nBY FRANK P.

A trifling affair\nto throw up a job over.\nIf the above article is meant to cast\na slur on the Italians, and it is to be\npresumed that it is from its reading,\nthen The Booster is ready to protest\nagainst it. Just because the man who\nkilled himself was an Italian is no rea\nson why he couldn’t have been as good\na citizen as any of us. As a matter of\nfact this particular Italian was not a\ngood citizen, but that is no reason why\nthe entire race of Italians should be\nheld up to ridicule any more than the\nentire American race should be ridi\nculed because one member of it turns\nout wrong. For the benefit of the\nCarbondale Item it may be stated that\nin Marble we have many Italians who\nare mighty good citizens —as good citi\nzens as any Americans.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT.\nReaders of The Booster will remem\nber that on one or two occasions we\ncommented rather sarcastically upon\nthe habit of the Rocky Mountain News\nof stealing articles bodily from The\nBooster without credit. An acknow\nledgment comes this week from George\nJ. Bancroft, who has been conducting\na department of the News, which reads:\nThe Booster, Marble, Colo.\nGentlemen: I beg to thank you\nmost heartily for sending me your pa\nper. I have found it full of interest\ning local news and I have borrowed\nfrom it frequently for my Industrial\nPage in the Rocky Mountain News,\nwhich I have been preparing in my of\nfice. I have enjoyed your paper and\nagain I thank you for your courtesy in\nmailing me a separate copy.\nThis clears up the mystery. It was\nMr. Bancroft who “borrowed frequent\nly” from The Booster and gave no\ncredit.\nTHE NEWS-CHAMPION at Gunni\nson is again under the management of\nHenry F. Lake, jr., who will bear the\ntitle of editor and manager of the pub\nlishing company which has taken over\nthe plant. Mr. Lake is no stranger to\nGunnison county newspaper readers,\nhaving conducted the News-Champion\nfor ten years prior to four years ago.\nJudge Clifford Stone, who has made the\npaper such a successduring the eighteen\nmonths he has been at the helm, will\ncontinue to hold stock in the concern\nand will devote attention to editorial\nand news work. With these two old\nmasters at the helm of the N.-C., it\nstands to reason that our county seat\npaper ought to be a “dinger.” Wel\ncome back to the fold, Brother Lake,\nand success to you.\nFOR SOME TIME we have been in\ntending to comment upon a little maga\nzine which comes regularly to this office\nand which is published by the Harrison\nSupply company, whose advertisement\nis printed in another part of this paper.\nThis magazine is a house organ, of\ncourse, but it is considerably different\nfrom the usual run of such organs by\nreason of its bright, breezy character.\nThere may be found in it each month\nmany articles of interest.\nDRIVING EVERY department of\nthe mill and quarries of the Colorado-\nYule Marble company with all the\npower it will stand, Mr. J. F. Manning,\npresident and general manager, is cer\ntainly doing everything possible to\nbring the company to a dividend-paying\nbasis, and he should have the encour\nagement of every person who holds any\ninterest in the company. And Mr.\nManning is neither asking nor receiv\ning any financial aid in running the\ncompany, either, for he is actually\nearning the money out of the plant to\nnot only pay the workmen and pay the\nimprovements, but he has paid off\nabout $80,000 worth of old debts out of\nthe earnings. Give Mr. Manning the\ntime and there isn’t a question but what\nhe will pay every cent the company\nowes and bring it to a point where the\nstockholders will begin to receive divi\ndends.\nEDITOR CHARLES LECKENBY of\nthe Steamboat Pilot is out with an an\nnouncement of his candidacy for state\nauditor. As a rule The Booster pays no\nslightest bit of attention to political an\nnouncements, but in this case, that cf a\nbrother editor, we take pleasure in\nmaking the announcement and we hope\nBrother Leckenby will get the plum. If\nhis ability to publish one of the best\nnewspapers in the state may be taken\nas a criterion of his ability in other\nlines, then he would fill the office of\nstate auditor with dignity and credit to\nhimself and the state.\nWE HAVE HAD nothing but agita\ntion and hysteria in Colorado for so\nmany years that it would be well worth\nwhile to try the experiment of all\nstanding together in an effort to ac\ncomplish something for peace, quiet and\nprosperity, and instead of attempting\nto regulate everybody and everybody’s\nbusiness why not devote our energies\nto developing and expanding our own\nbusiness.

A complete line of samples to\nshow you.—Kobey’s\nIn a recent issue of The Booster was\nprinted a brief communication from\nDr. F. B. Davison of Factoryville, Pa.,\nin which reference was made to the\nfact that Factoryville is also the home\nof Christy Mathewson (“Big Six”), the\nfamous New York ball pitcher. Dr.\nDavison writes The Booster again: “My\nDear Mr. Frost: —It was good in you to j\nrefer to me as living at the birthplace i\nof ‘Big Six’. I am sending you a\nsketch of my uneven life which will\nnot interest you but you may please\nhand it to Dr. Stephenson who may\nhave time to read it in the hot weather.\nI wish I were acquainted with you both\nbut I am too old, perhaps, to ever see\nColorado again. ” Dr. Davison, or, to\ngive him his title won in battle, Maior\nlavison, is mistaken in one thing. The\nbooklet sketching his life did interest\nus very much and we read every line of\nit. His has certainly been a very busy\nand eventful life and when his work is\nat last ended it will be with the full\nconsciousness of a life well spent. Af\nter finishing the reading of the biogra\nphy we have handed it to Dr. Stephen\nson as requested.\nDr. H. G. Haxby’s chest measure\nment is considerably above normal this\nweek owing to a trip he made in his\nmotor car from Carbondale to Marble\nlast Saturday over roads from Redstone\nhere that were worse than awful. With\nthe editor of The Booster as a passen\nger, the Doctor left Carbondale at 11\no’clock in the morning and made the\ntrip to Redstone over good roads in\nless than an hour, but just after leav\ning the latter place the car ran into\nroads that had been deluged with rain\nall the day before and it was still rain\ning. The little Metz car, however,\nproved a good “mudder” and it took\nthe steep hills like a duck takes to a\npond. On McClure hill, just this side\nof the Flats, the Metz passed a stalled\nPierce Arrow car of 40-horse power,\nowned by Mr. Berger of Denver, which\nhad been abandoned because the car\ncould not pull the hill there. Road\nworkmen had been repairing the road\nat that point and the fresh earth they\nhad piled in made the road a quagmire\nafter the hard rain. The Metz climbed\nthe hill all right and arrived in Marble\nat 2:30 o’clock, none the worse for the\ntrip except a liberal coating of mud.\nSt Paul’s Church.\nSeventh Sunday after Trinity.\nSunday school at 9:30 a. m.\nMorning prayer and sermon at 10:45.\nEvening prayer and sermon at 7:45.\nAll welcome.\nRev.
