BYAN.PK bop\n84H$\nABOUT AH DREW J0HH80H.\nRecolleotions by his .Secretary, Maj.\nTraomon, in the Century M agaaine\nAndrew Johnson was one of the\nneateHt men in hfe dress and per\nson I have ever known. During\nhie three years in Nashville, in\nparticular, be dressed in black\nbroadcloth, frock coat and waint\ncoat and black doeskin trousers,\nand wore a silk hat. This had\nbeen his attire lor 80 years, and\nfor mr st ol that time, whethei as\nGovernor ol Tennessee, memlier\nof Congress or\' United. States\nSenator, he had made all his own\nclothes. He was so xcrupulouaa\nbout his linen that he invariably\nchanged all of it daily, and some\ntimes oftener.\nHe was matchlessly perfect in\nfigure, about 5 feet 10, had band\nsome, broad ahouldera. fine fore\nhead, superb face, dark bushy\nhair, and small hands and feet.\nThe most marked feature about\nhim was his eyes, which were small\nand. although such eyes are not\nusually attractive, his were black\nspirkling and absolutely beau\ntiful He was not a gamester at any\nthing, and could play only in\ndifferently at checkers. In 1862\nhe explained to me that he had\nnever visited a theater because\nin his youth he larked the oppor\ntunity, and afterward would\nrather stud? and work or go to\nbed than. spend his time at a play\nhouse. He looked on nil kinds of\ngambling as wrong, never knew\none card or one domino from a\nnot her, and was never at ahorse\nrace. He bad been to a few cir\ncuseH and minstrel shows, and\nliked them.\nAndrew Johnson bad been call\ned h drunkard as well as a trait\nor; but the \' whirligig of time"\nhas set him right. on . the latter,\nand today there is no man of the\ncivil war whoisjrecievingsomuch\nhonest attention at the hands\nof historians. But that Andrew\nJohnson was a drunkard is more\ndifficult to disprove. Thisispart\nly because the only. time that he\nwas ever under the influence of\nliquor in his hfe the whole nation\nsaw him, either with their eyes\nor read of it, and upon an occa\nsion when he should bave been\nabsolutely solier I mean when\nhe wan inaugurated as Vice Pres\nident on the 4th ol March, 1865\n"But had not Johnson beeu a\ndrinking man through life?" 1\nhave often been . asked Not to\nthe extent the one incident im\nplied, indeed, Johnson had al\nways been considered a temper\nate man in all things. 1 sat with\nhim at the same table in Nash\nville at least once a day for 18\nmonths, and never bb wjiiiu take\nwine or liquor with any meal, He\nuewr drank a cocktail in his life\nnever was in a bar-room and did\nnot care for cbampane. He did\ntake two or three or four glass\nes of Robertson cpunty .whiskey\nsome days; some days less, and\nsome days and weeks no liquor\nat all. So, as drinking went in\nTennessee, Johnson would have\nbeen termed a strictly temperate\nman.\nThere is more catarrh in this sec\ntion of the country than ail other dis\nsases put together, and until the last\nfew years was supposed to be incura\nble. Fora (peat many years doctors\npronouoed it a local disease and pre\nscribed local remedies, and by eon\nstantly failing to core w\'th local treat\nment, pronounced it incurable. Sci\nence has provsn catarrh to be a con\nstitutional disease, anfl therefore re-\n1 ires eonstitntfonal treatment.\nHalls catarrh cure, manufactured by\nJ. P. Cheney & Co. Toledo, O.. is the\nonly constitutional cure on the mar\nket, It it taken internally in doses\nfrom ten dropt to a tablespoonful. It\nacts directly on the blood and mucus\nsurface of the system. They offer one\nhundred dollar for any case it fails\nto cure. Sen A for circulars and testi\nmonials, Address J P.

While nothing\nof a tangible nature has ret been\nbeard in connection with the Au\nstralian ballot bill, the situation\nis not discouraging, for some of\nthe most enlightened minds in\nNorth Carolina are bending their\nenergies in that direction, if late\nadyi-es from Raleigh are to be\nrelied upon.\nThe majority of the state pa\npers have frequently declared\nthemselves m favor of a modern\nand intelligent system ot voting\nand among these may be men\ntioned The Raleigh News and Ob\nserver, a paper which always been\nfound on the side of progress aud\nreform. The News and Observer\nin its Sunday isi-ue said:\n"Every state in the republic\nhas adopted the\', Australian bal\nlot except a few Southern states,\nand in the South the following\nstates have adopted this wise\nmeasure: Texas, Louisiana, Flor\nida, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Ken\ntucky, West Virginia and, Mary\nland. Why should North Caroli\nna be behind?"\nWhy, indeed, should North\nCarolina be behind? The press of\nthe state, the pulpits, the edu\ncational bodies and many of the\ncivic organizations have gone on\nrecord for the Australian ballot\nbecause it is the only method of\nvoting in which the true senti\nment of the electorate may be de\ntermined. The question has gone\nbje y o n d political lines; i t\nhas become the universal demand\nof a people sick and-tired of bri\nbery and corruption at the poles.\nVery few states, and these are in\nthe South, retain the antiquat\ned\' system of balloting which only\nthe professional politician favors\nbecause he has ends of his own to\nserve. No slate 1 hat ever adopt\ned Australian ballot has gone\nback to the old form which ever\ndefeats the popular will, and some\nof the Enropean countries have\nnsfd it for over half a century.\nThere is every reason why North\nCarolina should adopt the Aus\ntralian ballot, and no good rea\nson why it should not. Our sena\ntors and representatives .it Ral\neigh can add much to their laurels\nbv heeding the voi?e of the people\nwhteh is loud and clear in its op\nposition to the present order of\nthings at the poles.\nCalifornia Woman Seriously AI-\narmed.\n\'A short time ago I contracted a\nsevere cold which settled on my\nlungs and caused me a great deal of\nannoyance. 1 would have bad cough\ning spells and mv lungs were so\nsore and inflamed 1 began to be seri\noasly alarmed.

Zion\nBaptist church, of which he lived\na true christian until death. He\njoined the Masonic Fraternity at\nLiberty Lodge, Wilkesb iro, N.\n0 , about the year 1856 He lov\ned the Order and obeyed its\nsublime teachings, was ever rea\ndy to contribute to the relief of\nthe worth;, distressed brother\nMaster Masons, their widows a nd\norphans.\nHe enlisted in the Confederate\narmy in ihe spring of 1861, and\nserved as Lieut , Co.

Weconnot en\ntntirely agree with the Mont\ngomerian. That the new system\nhas not prove I so good as it\nmight is no reason lor going\nback to worse.
