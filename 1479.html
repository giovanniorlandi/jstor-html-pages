This was not the first time that convicts resisted confinement\nat New York’s first state prison. During its first six years of operation, \nprisoners frequently rebelled, set fires, and tried to escape.1 Although the \nhistorical record for this incident is fragmented—newspaper articles and \na report to the New York State Legislature—it provides an opportunity to \nanalyze prisoners’ responses to incarceration. Some inmates, such as Daniel \nMcDonald, a convicted horse thief sentenced to seven years of hard labor, \nthe alleged “ringleader” of the uprising, persistently resisted incarceration.2 \nOn the other hand, Isaac Lytle and other inmates refused to join the uprising.\nLytle may have hoped that his good behavior would lead to an early \nrelease. Other prisoners, such as Comfort Carpenter, who was convicted of \nforgery and sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor, perhaps aligned \nwith keepers (guards) during the rebellion in hope of receiving a pardon \nthat might reunite them with family and friends.3\nMcDonald and his cohorts may have spent days, weeks, or even months \nplanning their escape. Between five and six in the evening, McDonald and \na handful of prisoners set fire to one of the apartments—a room that confined\nat least eight prisoners. When keepers arrived to extinguish the fire, \nthe men escaped from the apartment and rushed into the prison’s interior \nThe author thanks Thomas D.

A keeper reported that McDonald claimed that he was “unjustly \nimprisoned” and therefore “he would escape over the Walls of the prison.”4\nIn the prison’s courtyard, McDonald and his followers encountered \nanother group of prisoners working as blacksmiths and nailers. These men \n“refused to join” the uprising. Some inmates went further; they pledged \nto protect keepers “at the risque [sic] of their own lives.” Rebelling prisoners\nclimbed a scaffold in hope of scaling one of the prison’s exterior walls \nto regain their liberty. A keeper rang the prison’s bell to alert keepers and \nresidents of the surrounding neighborhood that an uprising was unfolding. \nKeepers ordered prisoners “to desist.” Rebelling prisoners pelted keepers\nwith “very abusive language” and “brick bats and hammers.” Keepers \nresponded by peppering prisoners with bullets, and in time, regained control\nof the prison.5\nNot all prisoners participated in the rebellion. Isaac Lytle attempted to \navoid the melee. Lytle stayed inside his apartment and watched the unrest \nfrom a window. According to keeper John Bailey, Lytle “was uniformly \na well behaved man, and did not discover the least disposition to join the \nriot, or to have any kind of concern with the rioters.” Lytle’s attempt to \nsecure his safety by staying inside his apartment failed.  When keepers shot \nat the escaping prisoners, a stray bullet penetrated his skull. Later that evening\nLytle died.6\nOther prisoners, such as Comfort Carpenter, refused to assist the rebelling\nconvicts. Carpenter was a forty-seven-year-old white-male farmer \nfrom Rutland, Massachusetts. When two prisoners invited Carpenter to \njoin the uprising, he declined. The two prisoners “seized” him. Carpenter \nescaped their hold. He “declared that he would die rather than be concerned\nin such an attempt to break the prison.” Undeterred, uprising pris-\noners “armed with knives and hammers, threatened vengeance to all who \nwould not join them.” Carpenter and the convicts who refused to participate\nalso armed themselves with knives and other tools from the prison’s \nworkshops. According to keeper Bailey, prisoners Daniel Callahan, George \nThompson, and James Dongherry pledged to protect him during the upris4.\nCommercial Advertiser, April 6, 1803.\n5.

After keepers and a militia company opened fire on prisoners, keeper \nThomas Hartley declared:\nLet me entreat you to desist from further violence; consider the danger\nyou are in; you are sporting away your lives as of no value; see \nthat poor unhappy being, who is now apparently breathing his last, \nand who was with you a few minutes ago; put a stop to your hazardous\nattempt now, and it may be a means of alleviating your future \npunishment.7\nHartley’s words as well as the actions of Carpenter, Lytle, Callahan, \nThompson, and Dongherry, suggest the powerful prospect the alleviation \nof punishment had on some prisoners’ actions. Prisoners had good reason \nto hope that accommodating actions would lead to a pardon. Between 1797 \nand 1803, 137 prisoners, approximately twenty prisoners per year, received \npardons.8 During the early years of the prison, when it was not crowded, \nkeepers and inspectors used pardons to reward good behavior, not to make \nroom for new prisoners. Surviving records suggest that none of the prisoners\nwho aligned with keepers earned a pardon.\nWhen keepers regained control of the prison, Lytle was dead and \nfour or five mortally wounded prisoners died during the next few days, \nMcDonald and his followers failed to escape, and prisoners who behaved \nas Carpenter, did not earn pardons. Keepers confined McDonald and his \nassociates inside the prison’s solitary cells on a sparse allowance of bread \nand water—their only disciplinary recourse until an April 1819 act that \nauthorized whipping. In their 1803 annual report to the legislature, inspectors\nof the prison, who served as its governing board, began a brief para-\ngraph about the uprising: “With much regret. . . .” Despite the carnage and \nchallenge to their authority, inspectors publicly downplayed the uprising’s \nsignificance by writing, “It is with much satisfaction . . . that although \nvery great pains were taken to induce the remainder of the convicts to join \nthose who thus endeavored to escape, they refused to be concerned in the \nenterprise.”9 \n7.

The actions of prisoners, such as the men involved in the 1803 \nuprising, in addition to a transatlantic culture of prison reform, spurred \nNew York reformers and politicians to design not only new institutions, \nbut also new disciplinary regimes at New York’s famous antebellum penitentiaries—Auburn\n(1818) and Sing Sing (1826). An analysis of the actions \nof New York’s first prisoners contributes to the interpretations of the existing\nhistoriography of imprisonment in early national and antebellum New \nYork State that focuses primarily on the thoughts and actions of prison \nreformers, policy debates, and a transatlantic culture of reform, by demonstrating\nthat prisoners too influenced the incarceration regimes of state \nprisons. \nRelying primarily on sources generated by promoters of incarceration, \nhistorians of early U.S. prisons often neglect to analyze sufficiently the \nactions of prisoners.10 As historian Leslie Patrick argues, “Throughout \nthe literature, prisoners remain either abstractions or absent—they have \nbecome imagined subjects confined by silence, yet victims first of circumstance\nand finally of history.”11 Until recently, many historians have rep-\nlicated reformers’ abstract portrayals of prisoners, not as individuals, but \nas static, lifeless statistics in countless tables and graphs. For the most part, \nhistorians are only beginning to examine the individual lives and actions of \nthe men, women, and children whom initial prisons confined, attempted to \ndiscipline, and purportedly aimed to reform.12 Prisoners’ varied responses \n10.

The \nideas of British prison reformer John Howard, Italian legal theorist Cesare \nBeccaria, and Pennsylvanian reformers Caleb Lownes and Benjamin Rush, \neach of whom were members of a transatlantic “culture of sensibility,” \ninfluenced the design and disciplinary regime of the prison.13 Impressed \nby what they observed, Eddy and Schuyler drafted an act for the construction\nof New York’s first state prison. They introduced the act to the State \nLegislature at a fortuitous moment. Earlier in the year, during his annual \naddress to the State Senate, Governor John Jay invited his fellow politicians \nto ponder, “how far the severe penalties prescribed by our laws in particular\ncases admit of mitigation; and whether certain establishments for con-\nof Imprisonment: Protest, Politics, and the Making of the American Penal State, 1776–1941 (New York: \nCambridge University Press, 2008); Caleb Smith, The Prison and the American Imagination (New Haven: \nYale University Press, 2009); Jennifer Graber, The Furnace of Affliction: Prisons & Religion in Antebellum \nAmerica (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2011); Graber, “Engaging the Trope of \nRedemptive Suffering: Inmate Voices in the Antebellum Prison Debates,” Pennsylvania History 79 (2012): \n209–223; Michele Lise Tarter and Richard Bell, ed., Buried Lives: Incarcerated in Early America (Athens: \nUniversity of Georgia Press, 2012); Erica Hayden, “‘She keeps the place in Continual Excitement’: \nFemale Inmates’ Reactions to Incarceration in Antebellum Pennsylvania’s Prisons,” Pennsylvania History \n80 (2013): 51–84; Jodi Schorb, Reading Prisoners: Literature, Literacy, and the Transformation of American \nPunishment, 1700–1845 (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2014); Jonathan Nash, “‘This Scourge \nOf Confinement’: James Morton’s Experiences of Incarceration in the Antebellum United States,” The \nPennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 139 (2015): 109–134; and Jen Manion, Liberty’s Prisoners: \nCarceral Culture in Early America (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015).\n13.

In his 1764 On Crimes \nand Punishments, Beccaria argued that punishment should be proportional to the crime. John Howard’s \n1777 The State of the Prisons influenced the architectural designs and reformatory regimes inside the \ninitial Pennsylvania and New York state prisons. G.J. Barker-Benfield’s The Culture of Sensibility: Sex \nand Society in Eighteenth-Century Britain (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992) refers to the development\nof British sensibility and its connection with prison reform. Barker-Benfield argues that prison \nreformers such as Howard drew “upon the culture of sensibility” to reach multiple audiences (225). In \nthe context of the United States’ commercial economy during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth \ncenturies, Barker-Benfield claims, “the culture of sensibility was translated into philanthropy.” BarkerBenfield,\n“The Origins of Anglo-American Sensibility,” in Charity, Philanthropy, and Civility in American \nHistory, ed.

Both the \nState Senate and Assembly passed the act.15\nAfter the act’s passage, New Yorkers could read congratulatory pamphlets,\nreports, and newspaper articles about the state’s newest “benevolent” \nand “humane” institution, the New York State Prison, in the City of New \nYork. The America Minerva, a New York City newspaper, welcomed the \nact’s passage: “We announce with great pleasure, that the judiciary bill has \npassed both houses of the legislatures of this State. Capital punishment is \nabolished, except in the case of murder & treason.”16 The act stipulated \nthat only individuals convicted of murder and treason “shall suffer death” \nand outlawed public punishments such as whipping. The act mandated \nthat individuals convicted of felonies, besides murder and treason, shall be \nsentenced to “hard labour” in a state prison. Lastly, the act appointed John \nWatts, Matthew Clarkson, Isaac Stoughtenburgh, Thomas Eddy, and John \nMurray, Jr., all influential men, to “a board of commissioners for erecting \nand building ‘a State prison in the city of New York.’”17\nThe architectural design and disciplinary regime of the first New \nYork State Prison closely mirrored Philadelphia’s Walnut Street Prison. \nThe regulations of each prison banned liquor and outlawed communication\nbetween prisoners and the outside world. Just as at the Walnut Street \nPrison, prisoners confined inside the New York State Prison were to be \n“cloathed in habits of coarse materials, uniform in colour and make, and \nbe sustained upon inferior food at the discretion of the said inspectors, and \n14.

Prisoners labored together during the day, \nand at night, at least eight prisoners, often more after the prison became \nincreasingly crowded during the 1810s and 1820s, slept in an “apartment.” \nRinging bells, just as at Northern factories and Southern slave labor camps, \ndivided each day into temporal segments. A bell rang at sunrise to awaken \ninmates. Prisoners then washed their faces and hands before eating breakfast.\nAfter breakfast, another bell rang to summon prisoners to labor inside \nthe workshops. At mid-afternoon, a bell rang again to call prisoners to the \nmess hall for supper. After supper, prisoners returned to work. Then, in \nthe evening, another bell rang to signal that it was time to eat dinner. After \ndinner, keepers marched prisoners back to their apartments for the night. \nThe next day, and the next, and the next, all followed the same routine of \naural and temporal discipline.19\nAlthough legislators frequently changed the inspectors who served \non the prison’s governing board, and keepers and contractors came and \nwent, much remained constant inside the prison during its thirty-one years \nof operation.20 Despite the increasing numbers of imprisoned men and \nwomen, officials expected prisoners to labor for the benefit of the institution.\nIn addition, prisoners resisted confinement in subtle and not so subtle \nways. In an effort to discourage inmate resistance, legislators passed an \nact on April 2, 1819 that authorized keepers to whip prisoners who disregarded\nthe institution’s regulations, refused to work, resisted officials’ com-\nmands, or destroyed raw materials or finished goods. The act also encour18.\n“An Act making alterations in the criminal law of this State and for erecting State prisons,” 298.\n19.

Coffey entered after being convicted of forgery and \nsentenced to seven years hard labor in 1819.\nCompared with other prisoners, Coffey was well-employed and welleducated.\nHe worked as a lawyer and may have earned a university \ndegree.22 Coffey’s 1823 Inside Out; or, an Interior View of the New-York State \nPrison, one of less than a handful of texts published by former Newgate \nconvicts, provided a firsthand account of his confinement. Unlike prison \nofficials, Coffey found nothing about the prison to praise. He wrote to \ndemonstrate eight points: “the prison has failed to promote the object of its \ninstitution”; its officers were “immoral”; prisoners “corrupted each other”; \nthe prison failed to prevent crime; congregate convict labor was “generative \nof depravity”; convicts were “treated with the utmost inhumanity”; keepers \nabused their pardoning power; and the prison’s finances suffered from a \n“want of integrity.”23 Coffey’s book was discussed in the State Legislature \nand apparently read by some convicts, such as John Maroney.24 It also \nalarmed inspectors who wrote in their 1824 report that it was “written with \na revengeful and malignant spirit, and for the avowed purpose of bringing \nthe prison into disrepute and to excite mutiny within its walls.”25\nBefore his imprisonment, Coffey thought he knew the world hidden \nbehind the prison’s “dreary” gate and walls. As an attorney, he may have \nlearned about the prison by reading pamphlets and reports written by \nprison officials. He imagined the world inside the prison as “a horrid place, \nand I naturally expected to find every visage sad, every eye sunk, every \ncheek pale, and every heart among the convicts, uncommonly depressed.” \nWhen he entered the prison, however, he learned that his imagination \n21.

Depraved in the most shocking\ndegree, they evinced everything unmanly, obscene and disgusting. . . . \nImprisonment was divested altogether of its terrors.”26\nKeepers whom reformers portrayed as upstanding citizens who provided\nprisoners with virtuous examples to emulate, were not, according \nto Coffey, much better than the prisoners they supervised. Coffey blamed \nkeepers for prisoners’ “unmanly, obscene and disgusting” behavior. Instead \nof being virtuous men, Coffey claimed that keepers drank, swore, gambled, \nand played pranks on prisoners. They “indulge[d] themselves in the most \nobscene and wicked conversations, with vulgar, profligate and abandoned \nconvicts, to the manifest corruption of many within their hearing.” Coffey \n“not unfrequently” observed keepers “staggering, from intoxication, about \ntheir shops, abusing every convict whom they casually met, and venting \ntheir vulgarity without blushing or reserve.” According to Coffey, keepers, \njust as much as prisoners, required reform.27\nAs Coffey’s observations suggest, it was difficult for convicts to avoid \nthe internal politics of the prison because by the late 1810s the prison was \ncrowded. The prison contained fifty-four twelve-by-eighteen foot apartments,\ndesigned to confine eight prisoners each. The prison, therefore, was \nto confine 432 prisoners at its maximum occupancy. In January 1805, less \nthan ten years after it opened, the prison confined 428 prisoners.28 Four \nyears later, in December 1809, the prison housed 478 prisoners.29 By the \nend of 1812, 486 prisoners were confined inside the prison. In 1816, with \nthe nation in an economic depression following the War of 1812 (18121815),\nthe prison confined 659 prisoners, most of whom committed prop-\nerty crimes, which meant that approximately twelve prisoners slept in each \napartment.30 After this highpoint, legislators authorized the construction of \n26.

They told stories, boasted of previous exploits, and \nformed relationships. They also sang, gambled, swore, argued about politics\nand other subjects, traded tobacco, and wrestled. Coffey slept in a room \nwith eleven other prisoners. By the light of a “dull lamp,” he observed \nsome convicts engaged in “close conversation” while sitting around a \n“greasy table.” Others sat scattered throughout the room on benches, straw \nbeds, and the floor.31 “Confined together, and having continual opportunities,\nof unrestricted conversation,” Coffey wrote, “it is natural that the \nconvicts should consummate friendships with, and imbibe the principles of \neach other.”32 One of Coffey’s apartment-mates, a man convicted of highway\nrobbery, boasted that he had committed “the most manly crime in the \nprison.” A jury convicted Coffey’s “bed fellow” of perjury. Together, they \nslept upon a bed of “filthy straw, worn nearly as fine as bran, lying in one \ncorner of the room.”33\nOther sources corroborate Coffey’s claims about inmates’ activities in \nthe apartments. John Maroney, who was sentenced to the prison in 1821, \nwrote that the apartments confined “as many as fourteen men.” Inside \nthe apartments, prisoners’ nighttime “conversations not unfrequently \nturned on their former projects of villiany [sic]—of their hair-breadth \nescapes—and their future intentions.”34 Likewise, in their annual reports \nto the legislature, inspectors lamented the ruinous effects of congregate \nnighttime confinement. In 1814 they observed, “while eleven or twelve \nprisoners are compelled to sleep together in each room, reformation, the \nobject of punishment is not so likely to be obtained as in a greater degree of \nseparation.”35 According to inspectors, nighttime congregate confinement \nspread vice, disease, and vicious habits.

Male prisoners \nproduced goods for private contractors inside the prison’s workshops. At \nthe end of 1802, the prison incarcerated 372 male prisoners. Of these, 179 \nworked in the shoemaking workshop as shoemakers, binders, cutters, and \nclosers. Another nineteen prisoners worked in the prison’s nail workshop. \nWhile the remaining 159 men, minus three prisoners in solitary confinement,\ntwenty-two in the infirmary, and four “invalids unfit for labor,” \nworked as blacksmiths, carpenters, coopers, tailors, weavers, oakum pickers,\nfurriers, gardeners, barbers, clerks, engravers, and assistants to the \nprison physician.37 The labor tasks expected of male prisoners remained \nconsistent while the prison remained in operation. \nIn the workshops, male convicts often outnumbered keepers by fifty \nor sixty to one. Inmates often avoided work when keepers were not looking.\n“Whilst the keepers were out,” Maroney observed, “dice, cards, and \nchequers were introduced; wrestling, dancing, singing, and fighting, were \npractised.”38 Imprisoned men even stole raw materials and finished products\nthat they traded to civilian contractors and workshop foremen in \nexchange for “tobacco, snuff, cheese, butter, pickles, onions, and not unfrequently,\nardent spirits.”39 As Maroney’s observations suggest, inmates culti-\nvated and maintained cultures of opposition inside the prison’s workshops. \nMale prisoners frequently disrupted the prison’s coerced-labor regime. \nJust as servants and enslaved laborers, prisoners resisted coerced labor by \nworking slowly, sloppily, and destroying material. Coffey claimed that \nweavers burned and destroyed cloth with “unnecessarily powerful acids.”40 \nIn his 1812 report, Head Keeper Nicholas Roome reported that he confined \nthe following prisoners inside solitary cells: John Grant “for setting fire to \n36. “Annual Report of the Inspectors of the State Prison, in the City of New York,” in Journal of the \nAssembly of the State of New York, Forty-Fourth Session (Albany: J.

On June 13, 1799, fifty to sixty shoemakers “seized the keeper” \nand “furnished themselves with hammers and axes, from the carpenter’s \nshop and the nailery, and proceeded to force the outer gates.” Large piles \nof firewood blocked the gates and prevented their escape. Approximately \n300 soldiers, including artillery, arrived at the prison to suppress the insurrection.42\nIn addition to attempting escapes, prisoners set fires that dam-\naged the prison’s industries. Five years after an 1804 fire, Prison Agent P.H. \nWendover wrote that it “was productive of much injury to the business \nof the prison, both by the loss of labor, and damage to a large amount sustained\nto the stock on hand.”43 \nThe specter of arson haunted the prison. In 1812, prisoners “deliberately \nand willfully set on fire” one of the prison’s “principal workshops.” The \nfire destroyed the workshop, “consum[ed] a considerable amount of materials\nand valuable tools,” and compelled Prison Agent William Torrey to \nrequest an additional $15,000 in appropriations from the Legislature.44 In \n1815, inspectors began to advocate for “more rigorous discipline” to punish\ninmates who committed arson. They also proposed replacing a wooden \nbuilding used to store raw materials and the goods inmates produced in the \nprison’s north yard with a stone one because of their “constant apprehension”\nof arson.45\n41. “Annual Report of the Inspectors of the State Prison, in the City of New York,” in Journal of the \nAssembly of the State of New York, Thirty-Sixth Session (Albany: Solomon Southwick, 1813), 239.\n42.

Women attended \nthe sick, washed and sewed inmates’ uniforms, cooked, cleaned, and spun \nwool. Despite the centrality of women’s labor to the operation of the prison, \nwhite, male, middle-class officials frequently denigrated female inmates.46 \nIn his 1812 report, Torrey described female convicts as “the very refuse of \nsociety: They are ever complaining; very refractory; and, of course, very \nmuch under prison punishment; their work never has, and perhaps never \nwill, be made productive.”47 In 1815, prison agent Alexander Coffin, Jr., \nclaimed that imprisoned women were “a great expense and no profit.”48 \nContrary to officials’ claims, women’s work of cleaning was important \nbecause inspectors argued that reformation could only occur in a context \nof cleanliness, and cleanliness was one of the primary goals of women’s \nlabor.49 Women cleaned the workshops, yards, chapel, dining area, and \nhalls of the prison. They moved freely from the women’s and men’s sections\nof the prison. Cleaning provided women with opportunities to form \nrelationships with male prisoners. If they desired, women could leverage \nthese relationships to their advantage while imprisoned and after their \nrelease.\nSylvia Van Rantz, a twenty-six-year old enslaved black woman, whom \na New York County jury convicted of grand larceny, used the mobility that \naccompanied cleaning to her advantage. While cleaning the prison, she \nmaintained a relationship with John Robertson, a twenty-six-year old free \nblack man whom a New York County jury also convicted of grand larceny. \nVan Rantz and Robertson were convicted and sentenced on the same day \nand spent two years incarcerated inside the prison.50 Upon their release, \nthey apparently left together.

Bulluegh thanked Stanford \nfor encouraging him “to open” his mind and heart. Bulluegh admitted that \nalthough he had “sinned greatly,” while incarcerated he had “bent the knee \nto my Creator and besought his forgiveness for my manifold transgressions.”\nDespite the “bitter grief & jest” of his fellow prisoners, Bulluegh \ndecided to dedicate his life to God. He closed his letter with a request: “I \nwould beg of you to visit, to comfort, and assist me, to lend me the aid of \nyour wisdom and experience to bear my lot without murmuring or repining\nuntill [sic] it shall please God in his mercy to loosen the chains of bond-\nage, and permit me to worship his name, in the midst of my unfortunate, \nand disconsolate family.”53\nAlthough prison officials and some inmates respected Stanford, many \ninmates refused to listen to him.54 For instance, on December 9, 1818, \nStanford recorded in his diary, “Preached twice in State Prison, with very \nlittle satisfaction.”55 Stanford also noted that when he visited the prison \n51.

Still, the Lord helped me to preach his holy & blessed word \nin the Chapel, morning and afternoon.”56 In his diary, Stanford also mentioned\nvisiting a woman confined in the prison’s solitary cells because it was \n“unsafe to admit her with other females.” Unlike other prisoners whom \nStanford wrote about, this “miserable prisoner” refused to speak with him. \nHe claimed that “she appeared to have very little feeling, although she had \nbeen confined alone 10 months.”57 \nThe unnamed imprisoned woman was not the only prisoner to reject \nStanford’s message. Maroney recalled that Stanford’s words made “no \nimpression on my hard and flinty heart.”58 In his 1824 report to the Board \nof Inspectors, Stanford claimed, “During the time of worship the unfortunate\nprisoners have paid that attention, and conducted with that propriety \nwhich could reasonably be expected.” Stanford also observed, however, \nthat prisoners “more inured to vicious habits, and hardened in iniquity, \ncare for none of those things [religious instruction], and therefore set with \ncool indifference.”59 Similarly, Coffin argued that despite Stanford’s “exertions\nto cure [prisoners’] moral diseases . . . the hearts of a majority of them \nappear to be steeled and impenetrable to the sublime precepts of the gospel\nof Christ, and even to the common moral duties, which as men, they \nowe to society.”60 By refusing to listen to Stanford’s sermons and spiritual \nadvice, prisoners subtly resisted the institution’s disciplinary regime.\nAs noted earlier, prisoners often resisted incarceration in more tangible \nways. Prisoners set fires frequently in hope of escaping or disrupting the \nprison’s operations. For instance, Edmund Barnes, Joseph Ambler, James \nStanford, William Wicker, William Griswold, John Rosenkrantz, and an \nunnamed prisoner shared an apartment with one another. Around 10:00 \nPM, on Monday, May 7, 1804, they attempted to escape. When a keeper \nreturned Barnes, Ambler, Stanford, Wicker, Griswold, Rosenkrantz, and \n56.

One of the men, armed with a knife, stood guard over \nthe keeper. The other men “tore down a chimney used for insertion of a \nstove pipe, and crept through the aperture to the garret where they set fire \nto the building.” Barnes, Wicker, Ambler, and Griswold escaped. Keepers \nlater located Rosencrantz, Stanford, and the unnamed prisoner hiding in \nanother part of the prison. Apparently, after keepers located Rosencrantz \nand Stanford, the men confessed that they hoped to escape after keepers \nhad extinguished the fire.61 \nThe testimony of the unnamed prisoner helped keepers piece together \nthe event. The unnamed prisoner claimed that he, Barnes, Ambler, Wicker, \nGriswold, Rosencrantz, and Stanford had spent the past week planning \ntheir escape. The convict claimed that they set fire to the prison to create a \ndiversion that would allow them to escape undetected. The prisoner who \ntestified got cold feet. While in the garret, he told Barnes “he had done \nwrong.” Barnes responded by declaring that “he would perish in the flames \nor get his liberty.” Authorities, though, quickly recaptured him, Ambler, \nand Wicker. Only Griswold regained his liberty.62\nAs early as 1801, only four years after the prison opened and following \ntwo recent inmate insurrections, Eddy criticized the prison’s congregate \ncells—a common lament of all future prison officials. “Had the rooms for \nthe prisoners been so constructed as that each should lodge but one person,”\nhe argued, “the chance of their corrupting each other would have \nbeen diminished, and escapes would have been more difficult.”63 Likewise, \nin an 1818 letter to British reformer William Roscoe, Eddy observed, \n“unfortunately the rooms, in all our prisons are calculated for eight to \nfourteen prisoners, so that when they are lodged together at night, they \nhave full opportunity to corrupt each other, and most frequently come out \nof the prison more hardened and depraved than when they entered it.”64 \nThe actions of prisoners encouraged Eddy and other officials to rethink \nthe design of the prison.

During the uprising, “a number of convicts . . . attempted \nto escape.” Following the initial uprising, convicts “refused to do any kind \nof work.”66 The striking prisoners “manifested a refractory disposition, \nrefusing to comply with the rules and regulations of the prison, singing \nbawdy songs, blackguarding the people as they passed by, and even offering\nviolence to their keepers.”67 An artillery regiment arrived to help keep-\ners regain control of the prison. After artillery fired at the inmates, they \nended their strike, and keepers confined between thirty-seven and sixty of \nthe “ringleaders” in iron chains.68\nAccording to inspectors, the uprising “literally threatened [the prison] \nwith total distruction [sic].” Inspectors argued “that a more energetic discipline\nin the government of the state prison has become indispensably neces-\nsary.” Inspectors encouraged legislators to pass new laws that would “make \nthe state prison a terror to evil doers.”69 In April 1819, legislators responded\nto inspectors’ pleas by passing an act that encouraged the classification \nof inmates and authorized the whipping of disobedient convicts, “not to \nexceed thirty-nine lashes at any one time.”70 The uprising of 1818 and the \n65.

Despite the new act, prisoners continued\nto resist confinement, attempted to escape, and staged uprisings.71  \nThroughout Newgate’s thirty-one years of existence, inmates frequently \ntook control of the congregate apartments, workshops, and common spaces \nto form communities and cultures of opposition. According to reformers,\nprisoners’ culture seduced “criminal youth.” “Vicious as may be their \npreconceived principles and habits,” Stanford wrote, “it cannot otherwise \nbe expected but that both will be highly cultivated by their associating \nwith men more expert and rooted in crime than themselves.” In hope of \npreventing young criminals from listening to seasoned criminals, Stanford \nclaimed to have taken “every favourable occasion to give them my best \nadvice.” The culture prisoners created made him “deeply lament that the \ninternal construction of the prison is such, as illy to admit of classification; \nand without this, little reformation of any kind, can be expected, while \nthe labour of the keepers is ten fold the more heavy upon their heads.”72 \nPrisoners used the architectural design of the first New York state prison \nto maintain their own distinct cultures and communities. Prisoners resisted \nincarceration to maintain their individual identities and to form collective \nidentities that challenged officials’ goals.\nLegislators authorized the construction of Auburn and Sing Sing state \nprisons partly in response to the actions of prisoners confined at Newgate. \nPrisoners pushed reformers, legislators, and members of the public to view \nthe prison not as a place of potential reformation, but as a place where old \noffenders schooled the young in the criminal arts, and where men formed \ngangs that would later commit crimes. Auburn and Sing Sing were built \npartly as a response to the actions of the state’s first inmates, where reformers\nand politicians implemented an incarceration regime based upon \nsolitary confinement at night, and silent congregate labor during the day. \nKeepers at Auburn and Sing Sing employed brutal corporal punishment \nto enforce discipline and maintain order. Austin Reed recalled his multiple \nincarcerations at Auburn during the 1840s, “Them was the days when the \nprisoners’ backs was cut and lacerated with the cats [cat o’ nine tails] till \n71.

The famous New York prisons of the antebellum era were \nconceived, planned, and built in response to the actions of the state’s first \nprisoners. The men and women imprisoned at Newgate were critical, yet \nunderappreciated and often overlooked, influences on the construction, \nregulations, and operation of New York’s antebellum state prisons that \ncontinue to confine convicts today.\n73.
