A committee met the\nexcursion half way and escorted the\npencil pushers to the far-famed\nprecincts of Brownsville, where the\ntrain was met with carriages, and\nthe visitors distributed to the va\nrious hotels and private residences\nwhere accommodations had been\nassigned in advance. After remov\ning the dust of travel, the editors\nwith their wives, daughters, sisters\nand sweethearts met at the Miller\nand took carriages for a drive over\nthe city. There were men and wo\nmen who had grown gray in the\nservice of public opinion molding,\nyoung men and women with the\nspirit of ambition lighting the eye,\nall bent on extracting from their\nvisit to the most southern city of\nour great state, all the pleasure that ,\nwas there portion- The far famed\nRio Grande, with its turbid flow\nand the ferry which was later to\ntransfer them to our city republic,\ncame in for a large share of inter\nest. The custom prevailing in the\nlower Rio Grande section were, Bragg." Capt. Kelly told of the ad\nnever ceasing matters of interest 1 vancement that had come to this\nto the disciples of the faber, paste -\npot and shears. They came, saw\nand were delighted. Uncle Sam\'s\ndomain at Fort Brown .was duly\ninspected and revealed the fact that\nthe fires of patriotism burned\nbrightly, and as Col. F\'. B. Baillic,\nof Cleburne remarked: "All things\nthat go up must come down, ac\ncording to the immutable laws of\ngravitation, but the stars and\nstripes had gone up never to come\ndown."\nAfter the crowd returned from\nthe drive, the cravings of the in\nner man were satisfied, a short re\nspite was taken to prepare the vis\nitors for whatever pleasure was in\nstore later, the injunction being for\nall to meet at Riverside pavilion at\n8:30, where a reception, luncheon\nand a general mingling and -acquaintance\nmaking would be held.\nAt the appointed hour, true to\nthe instinct that prompts all news\npaper people to punctuality, the\ncountry\'s disseminators of wisdom\nand education congregated and\nwere heartily welcomed by a com\nmittee of our citizens, who assured\nthe visitors of the pleasure and\nhonor their coming had conferred.\nCol. Lott, who is known m every\ncity and hamlet of Texas, was mas\nter of ceremonies, and in a neat\nspeech assured the visitors of our\npleasure at their presence. After\nenumerating some of the adyan\ntages and possibilities of the sec\ntion, he closed by saying that when\nan acre of our territory was sold,\nthe purchaser also bought a large\nchunk of the finest climate in the\nworld.\nHe was followed by Mayor Fred\nJ. Combe, upon whom had fallen\nthe pleasant task of welcoming to\nour city the Texas Press associa-\ntion. This he did in a most happv\nvein, making the city\'s guest feel\nthat they were indeed welcome.\nHe assured them that the city was\nunlocked, the keys misplaced and\nthere need be no hesitancy or re\nstraint felt; the police had been\ngiven special instructions, and\nthere was nothing they should fear\nduring their stay here.\nPresident Tom Perkins, of Mc\nKinney, who is also mayor of his\nhome town, showing that he dwells\nin the land of appreciative people,\nresponded to the address of wel\ncome, told how glad the associa\ntion was to be our guests, and said\namong other things that while the\nvisitors had come prepared to re\nturn Sunday morning, he felt very\nmuch like his wife did when he\nasked her to share his joys and sor\nrows. She said "yes," but also\nsaid she might change her mind.\nPresident Perkins said he did not\nknow whether he would return\nSunday or not; he might his mind."\nHis remarks were highly appreciat\ned and seemed to voice the univer\nsal sentiment.\nCapt. Wm. Kelly was introduced\nand addressed the audience, his re\nmarks bein,g fitted with interesting\nfacts concerning the history of\nBrownsville and immediate section,\ncalling attention to the fact that\nvery near here were fought the\nbattles of Resaca de la Palma and\nPalo Alto, quoting the familiar\nphrase, "a little more grape, Capt.\n, section, the building of the Gulf,\nj Coaft Line railroad, giving to Col.\nI the credit for its connecting us with\ni the outside world. He told of the\nmaterial prosperity which was com\ning to our people, the result of\nshipping facilities, and cited spe\ncific instances of what had been ac\ncomplished in the way of agricul\nture. The address of Capt. Kelly\nwere listened to with marked inter\nest, showing that he had touched a\nresponsive chord in the hearts of his\nhearers. What he said was very in\nstructive and calculated to give a\ntrue insight into the vast possibili\nties of the Brownsville country,\nand his address received hearty ap\nplause. Lee J. Rountree, of the George\ntown commercial, J.S. Henderson,\nof the Corpus Crony, and F. B.\nBaillio, of Cleburne, an old stager of\n\'\nthe newspaper fraternity, who sees\neverything and forgets nothing,\nalso made appropriate addresses,\nall expressing their delight at\nvisiting Brownsville and apprecia\ntion of the true southern hospital\nity which had been accorded the\nmembers of the Texas Press \'as\nsociation. Perhaps one of the most truly\nappreciated features of the even\ning was ajJialect recitation by Miss\nMary Lehmann, daughter of C. F.\nLehmann, proprietor of the Hal-\nlletsyille Herald. Miss Lehmann\nis a gifted elocutionist, and delight\ned her audience.\nAfter the reception and luncheon\nand mutual acquaintances being\nmade, dancing was indulged\nin for a short time, after which\nthe\ncrowd dispersed to meet at\n. t to rns in reraru to ascertaining tne\n9:o0 Sunday -morning, to takeopp(JrtunUies of development of\na trip to Matamoros and see the , the great southwest of Texas.\nj many\nplaces of interest in our\nsister city.\nThe visitors began their crossing\n. . f . .\nto Mexico before the appointed\ntime, and shortly all were in. the\nland ot our netgnDors. Many in\nteresting places -were -visited, the\ncathedral, curio -establishments,\nbull ring and cemetery being among\nthe number. A call at the Ameri\ncan consulate was made, and Con\nsul P. Merrill Griffith welcomed his\nguests with a true spirit of hospi\ntality, and while not a citizen of\nTexas he is an ardent admirer of the\nLone Star state, and bade the news\npaper people welcome to Matamoros\nand his official residence. His re\nmarks were well received, and\nevinced his profound regard for the\nnewspaper fraternity and the pleas\nure he felt in having them pay him.\na visit. Delicious punch was serv\ned at the consulate by Consul\nGriffith, he being assisted by a com\nmittee pf Brownsville ladies con\nsisting of Mrs. Lott, Miss Lott and\nMrs. J. O. Wheeler. The table\nwas beautifully decorated with\ndrawnwork covers, cut glass and\nsilver, while beautiful cut flowers,\ncast their fragance over all. The\neffect all round was delightful and\nelicited much pleased comment\nfrom the visitors. The time drawing\nnear for the departure of the train\nadieux weresaci, amid expressions\nof mutual pleasure and the quili\npushers took the back track for\nBrownsville.\nThe visitors have gone. The\nimpress of their visit will be flt\nfor all time to come. When they\nreach home the holiday spirit with\nwhich they have been fillec for the\npast week will be laid aside, and\nthe stern duties of newspaper life\nwill be taken up with relieves?.\nstrength. They will write of tSeir\ntrip, give expression to the im\npressions that were made along\ntheir journey. Brownsville was\nthe terminal point, a point where\nthe next step landed them, on\nforeign soil. Did we treat them\nwell. They said we did, and gave\nunstinted praise for their rccep\ntion and entertainment while\nsojourning within our gates. The\nnext issue of their respective papers\nwill be a reflex of how they feel\nregarding the section visited. May\nwe hope that when they come to\nwrite of Brownsville and her peo\nple, the inspiration will come ta\ntell what they saw, heard and felt,\nextolling our virtues and allowing\nthe broad mantle of charity to hide\nour shortcomings. They say they\nwere delighted; we believe they\nwere. They say they arc coming,\nto see us again; we believe that,\ntoo. No visitor comes to the queen\ncity\' of the Rio Grande, partakes\nof the true hospitality of our peo\nple, and feels the inspiration which\nthis section alone can give, but\nleaves with the avowed determina\ntion to return again some day. and\nstay longer.\nGentlemen and fadies .of the\nTexas Press association, we are\nglad you came; you have done us\ngood, and if perchance we have\ndone ought to, for a moment,\nmake you forget your troubles, in\nconducting your great family\njournals in the.vanous fields where\nyou are your community\'s most\neloquent and faithful mouth piece,\nwe are well pleased.

It is r\'ured that the\ncompany refund $200 for a large\ntrunk, $100 for a small trunk, $25\nor a hand grip and S5 for a hat\nbox that in being sent to its des\ntination is lost. These figures\nmust be plainly printed upon the\nback of the check.\n"The excess baggage coupons\nmust also have the charges display\ned plainly on the back. The gen\neral rate for excess baggage in the\nRepublic is 12c per kilometep for\n1,000 kilss. The check will be\nmade of cardboard and the baggage\nagent will fill in the destination of\nthe passenger\'s baggage.\n"The new ruling does not apply\nto goods or baggage destroyed in\ntransmission, but only to that\nwhich is lost."\nA kilometer is five eighths of\na mile.\nGUAYALE CRAZY.\nDevelopment of Mexico\'s Rubber Industry\nHas Caused Land Values to Jumb\nSkyhigh.\nLaredo, Tex., June 7.
