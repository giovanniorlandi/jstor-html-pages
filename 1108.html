C.\nCAN\'T BE TOO CAREFUL.\nWhy will people persist in disre\ngarding the advice of physicians and\nthe dictates of common sense and\ncommon courtesy? For the past sev\neral months health officers through\nthe newspapers and in every other\npossible way have been warning peo\nple that influenza is disseminated by\nspit-swapping. That is a very inele\ngant way of putting it, but that is\nwhat the doctors say: they put it just\nthat way. When one coughs or\nsneezes without putting a handker\nchief over one\'s mouth, fine particles\nof spit are scattered through the air\nand remain suspended in the air for\nsome minutes, and any person who\nbreaths in that air so charged with\nfine spit-spray runs a great risk of\ncontracting influenza. You may be\nabsolutely certain that you have not\ngot the "flu" and that you could not\ngive it to another person, but the\ndoctors say that people who do not\nsuspect that they have the disease\ngive it to others by careless coughing\nand spitting. Even if there were no\ndanger to others in coughing and\nsneezing without covering up one\'s\nmouth and nose, it is highly improp\ner and impolite; and the danger makes\nit criminal.\nSome people and they are aston\nishingly numerous for this enlighten\ned age scoff at what the physicians\nsay and in defiance of all advice\nand common politeness perpetrate\nopen-faced coughs and sneezes where\never they please. They put their own\njudgment up against the judgment\nof the medicine man, but if by the\nsame careless coughing and sneezing\nsome one else gives them a case of\n"flu", they holler mighty quick for\nthe doctor to do his duty.\nA striking illustration of what it\nmeans to cough and sneeze openly is\ngiven in a report to the State Board\nof Health from a North Carolina coun\nty, as told in a Raleigh dispatch:\n"Themoving picture house of a\nsmall-TOwn in that county resumed its\nexhibit on the nierht of Fridav. No\nvember 29. Thev had a full house\nand several people noticed a man (a\nstranger) in the audience who cough\ned and sneezed openly several times\n(investigation later revealed the fact\nthat he had considerable tempera\nture). The community had entirely\nescaped the previous epidemic. To\nmake a long story short, by Monday\nnight, December 2, within 72 hours,\nevery family represented at the show\nhad from two to seven members in\nbed with a severe attack of influ\nenza, the manager himself even not\nescaping."\nFor the sake of others, don\'t cough\nor sneeze openly until you get out\nin an old field ten miles from an-\nBtate of Ohio, City of Toledo,\nLucas County, S3.\niFI5J?k J- e71e\' makes oath that he\nis senior partner of the firm of F J\nv-neney & Co., doing business in the\n28 Jlevdo; Co\'V and State afore\nsaid, and that raid firm will pay tho\neachLnN HUNTRED DOLLARS tor\neacn and every case of Catarrh that\ncannot be cured by the use of HAT T k\nCATARRH CURE.

E. McK. Goodwin\'s excellent!\nmanagement: The lowest bid on a\nhandsome infirmary which is ap-1\nproaching completion was $24,000,\nwhich looked cheap enough. "The\naverage superintendent in charge of\na public institution would have turn\ned the job over to the lowest respon\nsible bidder, and he would not be\nblameable for so doing. But Mr. Good\nwin, who is a master builder as well\nas a very exceptional school man,\nsaw where the State could save mon\ney, and in addition to his ordinary\nburdens, which are heavy and exact\nfog, undertook the construction of\ntht building under his personal su\npervision. The result is that he will\ncomplete it for a little less than $17,\n000, saving the State more than $7,000,\nand charging not a cent extra for\nthis great service." That is indeed\na record worthy of note. Charity\nand Children thinks that Mr. Goodwin\nis a better buyer than the commission\nestablished by the Legislature to do\nthe buying for a half a dozen or more\nof the larger State institutions and\nstates that for this reason a resolution\nwas passed at a recent meeting of\nthe board of directors asking the Leg\nislature to exempt this school from\nthe rules of the commission and al\nlow the superintendent to buy his sup\nplies where, how and when he pleases.\nWhich would seem to be a pretty safe\nthing to do with Supt. Goodwin.\no\n"THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT."\nThe trail of the German serpent is\na long and sinuous and slimy one. It\nis over all the earth. Such a mar\nvelous system of spying and propa\nganda work has never been known\nbefore. Information gathered during\nthe years since the war began by the\ninvestigation bureau of the Depart\nment of Justice and revealed in part\nrecently by A. Bruce Bielaski, chief\nof the bureau, makes a story that for\ndownright cussedness and despicable\nness is unparelleled. They tried to\nbuy newspapers; they corrupted every\nman they could, they did everything\nthey could by every foul means to in\nfluence sentiment in this country fa\nvorable to Germany before the United\nbtates entered the war and to make\ntraitors after that. Senator Overman\nis conducting the Senate inquiry into\nGerman propaganda methods. He\nsays: "The Senate intends to com\nplete this record for history. We\nwant the historian of this war to\nknow how Germany perfected its es\npionage and propaganda system under\nthe very nose of the American peo\nple." A Washington dispatch to the\nGreensboro News says:\n"The report of the Overman com\nmittee will be one of the most illum\ninating and far-reaching documents\never turned out by either branch of\nCongress. It will contain material\nfor the scenario writer, the nlav.\n, wright, the author of detective\nI and, above all else, it will embody\nimngs wmcn tne average American\nI eiti ZPff SlVmnlH Irnrvur oKnnf Via vwa4-Ii\nods of the world\'s master spies and\npropagandists. If the senate commit\ntee lives up to Senator Overman\'s\npromise that it \'will write a record for\nhistory,\' the inquiry will be vastly\nmore important than any congression\nal inquiry which has been given front\npage space within generations."\no\nThe contention of Senator Simmons\nand other Southern Senators that ni\ntrate of soda held by the War De\npartment at Wilmington and other\nSouthern ports should be distributed\nto farmers at the price that would ob\ntain in a free market, regardless of\nwhat the soda cost the government,\nseems only just and fair. The nitrate\nof soda was bought by the government\nfor war purposes at war-time prices,\nand if it is sold to farmers .at what\nit cost the government they will have\nto pay $15 or $20 a ton more than\nit could be bought for in a free mar\nket today, it is said. The govern\nment expects to take a loss on other\nsupplies bought as war supplies and\nit would not be fair to the farmers\nto make them protect the government\nagainst loss in purchasing this com\nmodity which they must have at any\nprice.\n0\ng\nn\ngj\nIS\na\nThe War is Closed\nThe boys are coming home.

December crop\nestimates of the Department of Agri\nculture showed that this year\'s total\nexceeds that of the former record year\n1917 by $614,380,000. There also was\na marked increase in acreage, the 355,\n895,722 total exceeding that of last\nyear by 10,700,000 acres.\nThese crop figures were looked upon\nwith satisfaction by officials as show\ning that the nation will be in even a\nbetter position to fulfill its pledge of\n20 million tons of foodstuffs to Eu\nrope next year than had been expect\ned.\nMost of the crops are larger than\nthe five-year average and some of\nthem established records, particularly\nspring wheat, barley, rye and tobac\nco. Corn, however, fell below the five-\nyear average. Today s estimates plac\ned the crop at 166,384,000 bushels less\nthan forecast in November, with total\nof 2,582,000 bushels. That is almost\nhalf a billion bushels less than last\nyear\'s record crop.\nThe wheat crop is larger than the\nfive-year average and almost 300,000,-\n000 bushels larger than last year\'s\ncrop, but it is more than 100,000,000\nbushels smaller than the record crop\nof 1915.\nAlmost all of the crops were \'vorth\nmore this year than in any previous\nyeui because of the high prices paid\nto producers. Corn\'s value was more\nthan three and one-half billion dol\nlars, wheat almost two billions, hay\nand cotton more than a billion and one\nhalf, and oats more than a billion.\nr.... . . u - i . ., , ,\n;wi u-asn nip ionowiiiK uescriDeu lands lying\nand being situate in Britt\'s township, Robe\nson county, North Carolina, described as fol\nlows ,to-wit :\ni FIRST TRACT: On the North side of Ten\ndruggist Sells for a few Cents a larg Mlle swamp ; beginning at a stake by a pine,\nbottle of Dodson\'s Liver Tone, whiel tt STVVa. tZj, ZtTr\nis entirely vegetable and pleasant U gj- Jj : fwAe ? s&e"\ntake and IS a perfect Substitute 101 thence 32 1-2 W. chains and 50 links to a\n. . - . . ... t Kw -1 J I Kl\'- :B o . . .1 : 1 .\nline ; thence alonx his line to the beginning.\ncontaining 40 1-2 acres ; excepting, however,\n20 1-10 acres on the southwest side of the divi\nsion which has heretofore been conveyed and\nwnicn is not intended to be conveyed in this\nconveyance.\nSECOND TRACT: Beginning at a stake in\nthe line of lot No. 3, on the west side of\nCypress Branch and runs that line 462 yards,\nN. 32 1-2 E. to a corner; thence N. 82 1-2,.

Food is the fuel that\nkeeps the human furnace burning.\n.Stop eating and the fires of life will\nsoon die out. Is it any wonder then\nthat when the system is not being\nproperly fed a person becomes thin,\niale, listless, run down and the day\'s\nwork becomes a drudgery. It is worse\nthan useless to try to tempt the appe\ntite with delicacies, if the stomach is\nunable to digest the food it receives.\nMost bodily ills can be traced to\njust this source. The stomach is out\nof order and the other organs, tissues\nand muscles are not receiving the\nnecessary food to build up the ravages\nof the day. The result is these or\ngans, tissues, and muscles become\nweak, opening the door to kidney\ntrouble, constipation, rheumatism and\na host of distressing complaints. These\ndisorders can be helped only by treat\ning the cause, the stomach.\n"I have suffered 20 years with pains\nin the limbs, and rheumatism," says\nMrs. Frances Cox who is perhaps one\nof the most generally known and best\nloved ladies of Greensboro\'s Salvation\nArmy, in a signed statement just\nmade for publication.\n"I couldn\'t even drink cold water,"\nshe continues, "as it would sour and\ncome back up hot as fire. All my\ntroubles are Very much benefitted\nnow because I have taken that won\nderful new herb medicine called Dre\nco.\n"Dreco surely has done me lots of\ngood and I want three more bottles."\nDreco, the midicine mentioned by\nMrs. Cox, is a compound of the juices,\nextracted from roots, herbs and ber\nries, nature\'s own remedy for nature\'s\nills. Hundreds of testimonials like\nthe above are coming in all stating\nthat Dreco seemed to go direct to the\nseat of the trouble and to wipe out\naches and pains.\nIf you are suffering why not go\nor send at once for a bottle of this\nwonderful medicine? Surely it is\nworth a trial.\nDreco is sold by almost any well\nstocked drusrsrist and mav be secured\nJ in Lumberton at all good druggists.\nHome Demonstration Club Organ\nized at St Pauls.\nSt. Pauls Messenger.\nAt the meeting called for Wednes\nday afternoon, to hear a tolk on mat\nters pertaining to the home, by Miss\nFlax Andrews, our county home dem\nonstrator, 24 ladies and three children\nwere present. Miss Andrews very in\nterestingly outlined the plan of a\nhome demonstration club, its bene\nfits and advantages to the community\nand following a short discussion of\nthe work, by some ladies present, a\nclub was organized with 19 charter\nmembers, and officers as follows were\nelected: Mrs. L. L. McGoogan, pres\nident; Mrs. S. p. Thompson, vice\npresident; Mrs. D. A. McQueen, sec\nretary. The club will hold regular meetings\non the2nd Thursday in each month,\nand it is hoped that a still larger\nnumber of our women will become in\nterested, and meet with us at our\nnext meeting. An exchange of ideas\nin regard to things pertaining to the\nhome and family, with demonstrations\nand explanations of the best ways of\ndoing things are bound to prove a\ngreat help and lasting benefit to any\nhouse keeper or those interested in\nthe welfare of community life.\nira n\na\no\nm\nINSURE TO DAY\nYOUR LIFE, HEALTH, AND PROPERTY.\nSouthern Life & Trust Co., Old Colony Insurance Co.\nGreensboro, N.
