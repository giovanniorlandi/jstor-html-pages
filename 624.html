Wore a book needed, Tuomaa\ncould locato It upon the Instant. It a\nbottle went into hiding, Thomas lm\nmediately placed his neatly-manicured\nforefinger upon It.\nBut evon caro may be ovordono,\nOno bright morning an Individual\nrushed precipitately Into tho doctor\'s\nplaco of business and announced that\nhe must see that person Immediately\nIn Dr. Duncan\'s private office, the\noowcomer gasped broathlessly, dropped\nInto a chair and tossed upon tho desk a\nheavy cloth bag.\n"There!" ho exclaimed. "That that\nEureka mlno business."\n"Well?"\n"That\'s some of tho ore," panted tho\nvisitor, mopping tho perspiration from\nhis forehead. "You\'ll have to assay\nthat stuff, and get at tho quantity of\nsilver It contains.\n"Why? What for?" demanded Dun\nsan, his eyes opening and losing some\n3f their wonted preoccupation.\n"Look here, Duncan. You went\nthrough an analysis of that ore two\nnonths ago, didn\'t you?"\n"Of course."\n"And It was all O. K.?"\n"It waa mighty flno silver ore," re\noiled the chemist, emphatically. "Ono\n3f tho finest samples I\'vo over seen.\'\n"And then you nnd I and Burnham\nwent ahead to buy the mine between\nas," pursued the visitor, "I put In $20,\n900, you put In $25,000 and Burnham\nmade up tho balance of tho $100,000\nwhich thoy asked for the property."\n"But, my dear Bliss, why are you go\nIng all over It again?"\n"Wait. Everythlngf waEtviloelyr! and\nrou anu i pain our money \'.o uurn\nham, to closo the deal "\n"And tho Eureka peoplo were goln\nto meet at his office and transfer th\nproperty to us at four o\'clock this aft\nernoon, If I remember correctly."\n"Well, I didn\'t speak of It to you or\nto Burnham, but I wroto to a chap out\nthero In Colorado an englnoer who\nwas In college with me and asked him\nto look up tho mine, as well as ho\ncould. McNabb that\'s the engineer-\nays that thero may very likely\nbo\npaying ore there, but the Indications\naro few and far between, and that it\nthese Eureka folks havo given us sam\npies of splendid oro from the mine.\nthey must have dug for It and filled u\nthe holo again!"\n"Good Ixird!" cried tho chemist.\n"Hero\'H some oro that was In sight\nwhich McNabb sent mo. Can you\nmanage to nssay It beforo four o\'clock\nthis afternoon?"\n"I may, possibly, with an almighty\ndeal of hustling,\'\' conceded the chemist,\n"What then?"\n"Just this. If it\'s all right why. let\nIt go at that. Burnham can seo th\ndeal through at four. If not, com\naround and confront these Eureka peo\npie!"\n"That will bo highly dramatic, I must\nsay," said Duncan.\n"It\'ll be a good sight better \'than be\ning stuck with a $100,000 sllvor mine,\nsaid Bliss. "Get to work. Duncan, for\nHeaven\'s sake! If this oro really Is\npoor stuff, bo thero ub much Ixifore four\no\'clock ns you con. If you don\'t turn\nup, we\'ll know It\'s all right. Good-by.\nI\'m off to see Burnham, Remember\nIf we do not hear from you by four, wo\nmiy tho Eureka."\nThomas entered with a broom to\nremovo any possible trace of mud\nfrom the sanctum floor.\nHis appearanco aroused Duncan to\nthe need of Immediate action.\n"Thomas," ho said, with an admoni\ntory flnger-Hhako, "I can\'t see anyone\nfor the rest of tho day. "Not a soul.\nDon\'t bother me with anything short\nof a tolegram."\nTho laboratory door closed with a\nbang, and Thomas was froo to delve\ntn elementary chemistry.\nNoontlmo arrived, aim Thoinna, lock\ning the door carefully, wont to his mid\nday meal and returned tv find things\nunchanged.\nThomas resumed hla olomontary\nchemistry, and tho hours Illttert by.\n"Thomas! What tlmo is It?" called\nDuncan\'s voice.\n"Seventeen minutes after three, sir,"\nresponded Thomas, glancing at tho\nclock and noting the time carefully.\n"Tell mo when It la a quarter to\nfour,"\n"Very well, sir."\nThomas had returned to page 27, and\n(vns learning about nltroron, and how\nIt you hitched an H to one side of It\nand threo Oa to tho other you had\nnitric acid, whon the door oponod nnd\na boy walked In with a packngo.\nThomas received it, signed tho book\nin his careful round baud, and ,con\nsldered. Plainly ho could uot enter tu labor\natory nnd deliver the little paroal Into\nlUu doctor\'s hand.\nBut ah I Tho doctor wished to bo\ncalled at 3:45! The very placet And\nwhat a slmplo solution! Thomaa placed\ntho heavy packago where thero would-\nbo uo possibility ot forgetting h\nwhere, In fact, tho doctor would re\nceive It at Just tho proper time\nAnd prcsontly: \'\n"Thomaa!

"I\'m glad It\'s no later.\nwas so extremely buay that I icarcu\nmight havo gone over my time, and\nint you\'d forgotten to call me."\n"Oh, no, sir," said Thomas, mliaiy.\nThe Garvin building, whero the\nafore-mentloned Burnham haa offices,\nla Just around tho corner and ono blocW\ndown from Dr. Duncan\'s establishment.\nBurnhatn\'a office reoked with cigar\n(.moke.

Burnham exclaimed.\n\'Have you been asleep?"\n"What?"\n"Why, thcy\'vo been hero and gono\nagain."\n\'Tho tho Eureka silver mine fel\nlows?"\n"Certainly," said Bliss, sharply.\n"But tho deal Isn\'t closed?" gasped\nthe doctor.\nOf course It\'s closed. Wo\'vo bought\nthe mine and paid for It."\nWoll. why on earth didn\'t you wait\nuntil four o\'clock?" Duncan demanded.\nThat waa the tlmo they wero to\ncome!"\nThat\'s the time they did come."\nBut confound It! when I left my\nplnce not flvo minutes ago it was 20\nmlnutea to four!"\n"You\'vo been In a trance, Duncan,\'\nBurnham observed, drawing out his\nwatch. "Look at that. It lacka Just\nthreo mlnutea to five o\'clock!"\n"Good heavens!" ejaculated tho\nchemist.\nSay!" cried Bllas. "That that\nore "\n"Yes! yes!" Duncan jerked out "It\'s\nabsolutely worthless. It\'s the worst\napology for silver ore I over saw!\n"And do you mean to say that we vo\nbought this Infernal Eureka mine and\npaid out $100,000 for it and it\'s no\ngood?"\n"It\'s not worth flvo!"\nBurnham nnd Bliss glared at each\notTier. Then together thoy glared-, at\ntho doctor.\nThero was more to their conversa\ntion, but It ia better omitted. Most of\nit wns emotional in tho extreme, nnd\nhad no particular point besides recrim\nination.\nLater, he plodded back to the labora-\ntory and climbed the stairs with a\nheavy tread. Tho loss would not ruin\nany of the trio; but when you havo\nslaved for several years to save $25,000\nand then have to watch It evauescenco\nwell, it\'s rough.\nDr. Duncan may well bo pardoned for\nkicking open the door and scowling\nfearfully ns ho passed through.\nBut If tho doctor scowled, Thomaa\nBotsford did not. He arose with a po\nlite Inclination of the head.\n"There waa a small packago deliv\nered for you, sir, while you wero busy\nthis afternoon."\n"What was it?" snapped Huncan.\n"I do not know, sir," replied Thomas,\nIn his carefully modulated English.\n"You left so hurriedly that I was un\nable to glvo it you."\n"Well, lot me have it."\n"You see, sir," pursued the paragon,\n"I feared that I might forget it, so I\nput It in the case ot the clock"\nDuncan glanced at tho timeploco and\nstarted.\n"Hello! Tho confounded thing\nstopped at 21 mlnutea to four!" he\ncried, violently. "That that was tho\nreason you didn\'t call mo!"\n"Yes, sir," acquiesced Thomas, with\nan apologetic smile. "I regrot It ex\nceedingly. You see, air, I alwnys wind\ntho clock at a quarter to four, so I put\nthe package In the lower part of tho\ncase, whero I should bo certain to find\nIt and glvo It to you at the proper\ntime."

"You you blasted little Idiot!" he\ncried at last. "Don\'t you know what\'s\nIn this parcel?"\n"Why no, sir!" Thomaa faltered,\naghast.\n"Well, It contains tho six horseshoe\nmagnets I ordered yesterday!
