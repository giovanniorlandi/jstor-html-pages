A. Ryan, who is connected with, the office of Secretary of the Interior, Dane, is on an official visit to Alaska,, analyzing conditions along the route, of the government railway and is look, ing into the resources and possibili, ties of the country. Mr. Ryan spent, several days in Cordova, while en, route to Fairbanks and Nenana, and is, now in Anchorage. In a recent issue, of the Alaska Railroad Record he, speaks optimistically of this territory, as follows:, "Alaska can pay the Nation’s War, Debt!”, There is a fine flavor of magnifi, cence in this slogan originatel by the, Alaska Citizen, of Fairbanks., In seven words Mr. J. H. Caskey,, the editor of the Citizen, has summed, up the limitless resources and ambi, tions of Alaska. The phrase conveys, to the war-ridden world the hope, nay,, the promise that Alaska can and will, create sufficient wealth during the, next two or three generations to mini, mize, if not to neutralize, the burden, of debt placed upon the people of the, United States through the great war., To anyone at all conversant with, the potential wealth of Alaska the, claim will not seem at all extravagant., The Nenana News and the Anchor, age Times have declared their con, fident belief in the possibility that the, potential wealth of this great terri, tory is sufficient to accomplish this, result. There will be those, of, course, who will challenge the possi, bility, but they will be men of small, vision., Twenty years ago the world looked, upon the old Indian Nation as a cattle, range of little value for agriculture, and of none for mineral production., Yet Oklahoma’s coal lands, oil lands, and zinc mines have added untold, wealth to the nation. The western, half of the United States was regard, ed as a desert by the majority of the, people of the United States. The, school books in my school days re, ferred to the “Great American Des, ert,” just as Alaska is now referred, to as a land of ice and snow. The, Llano Estacado was never dreamed of, as a region of boundless riches, yet, that Great American Desert is dotted, with cities and towns and the oil pro, duction of the staked plains is enorm, ous. Besides those regions once so, inhospitable, so bleak and barren,, Alaska is a fruitful field. It was to, the wise and provident policies of the, national government, which through, its liberal laws, made the develop, ment of the latent wealth of the great, west possible that the burdens laid, upon the people by the Civil War, were made easy to bear and easy to, pay. The west paid that debt many, times over., Alaska’s Great Area., In area Alaska equals that part of, the United States west of the Missis, sippi. It has as many square miles, as twenty-eight of the forty-eight, states of the Union. It has as great, a variety of resources as the northern, tier of states possesses. At Fairbanks, recently a banquet was given by the, Agricultural Society at which every, article of food, Including the sugar,, was of local production. Cattle and, horses, wintered in the open in some, of the interior valleys, come out in the, spring butter-fat and as sleek as if, cared for in box stalls. The enormous, herds of mountain sheep and caribou, are demonstrations of the value of, the ranges for meat production. The, grain production of the Fairbanks and, Rampart farmers prove that cereal, crops are not confined to the valleys, of the coastal Blope., But the basic industry, of course,, is and must be mineral production., There are literally millions of acres, of alluvial gold, silver, tin and copper, deposits that would be held of bo, nanza richness in California that are, now unproductive because of the ex, cessive costs of recovery. With the, completion of the government railroad, and connecting wagon roads to points, of production, with adequate water, lines on interior rivers and sufficient, coastwise shipping facilities, the de, velopment of Alaska’s mineral re, sources must be rapid and remuner, ative. Central power plants eligibly, located for the distribution of electric, power to the various mining camps, would revolutionize mining methods, and production costs. Electric cur, rent may be transmitted to distant, and Inaccessible regions where the, cost of fuel transportation would be, prohibitive. Mills for the reduction, and concentration of ores operated, electrically will in turn reduce the, cost of transportation to the railroad., It is even possible that systems of, trolley lines for the operation of elec, trically-driven trucks over mountain, roads may be found practical and eco, nomical. Looking twenty years ahead, none of these foreshadowed possibili, ties will seem stranger or more won, derful than the developments of the, twenty years just passed., Wonders of Recent Years., w no ispeaamg twenty years ago as, I am today of the next twenty years), had predicted that in metallurgy a, method of floating the mineral con, tent of ores on soap bubbles would, increase production and reduce costs, would have been regarded otherwise, than as a dreamer? Who, then pre, dicting the aeroplane as the winning, factor in a world war, the submarine, as an instrument that would nearly, annihilate trans-oceanic commerce, or, would have foretold the completion of, the Panama Canal by the United, Stats, or would have pictured our gov, ernment as owner and operator of, great systems of hydro-electric gener, ation and distribution, as reclaiming, vast areas of arid lands by irrigation, —who, I say, predicting these things, twenty years ago, would have been, classed other than as a visionary?, Perhaps the United States govern^, ment may never construct a system, of wagon roads in Alaska; it may, never erect immense electric power, plants adjacent to its coal fields and\', distribute the power throughout the, mining districts; it may never elec, trify the Alaskan railroad; it may, never encourage and stimulate the, search for gold and other mineral\', riches of Alaska by directly aiding, prospectors, as Canada does; it may, never appropriate money to assist in, the development of Alaskan re, sources; it may never establish a sys, tem of farm loans and\' state aid for, agriculture, but if it does not it will, be because Alaskans fail to impress, upon the nation the importance and, profitableness of such\' policies. River, and harbor improvements, railroad, land grants, liberal land laws, liberal, forestry laws, generous mineral and, homestead rights, prodigal expen, ditures for public works fostered, en, couraged and made possible for a, single generation of Americans to ac, complish more in the development, of natural resources in the western, states than was ever accomplished, before in the history of mankind in, twenty generations. With the ex, ample of the prodigious increase of, national wealth due to these policies, so that the United States is the rich, est of all nations, how can any one be, lieve that Alaska will be left, like, Topsy, to “just grow”?, Those who know anything at all, about Alaska know that her coal, her, oil, her precious and semi-precious, mineral deposits are greater than, those of any other known like area, on this continent. Five well-defined, coal seams on Lignite Creek in the, Nenana field have a total thickness, of over 300 feet. One field in the Chu, litna district is reputed to have one, bed 200 feet thick. As these deposits, exceed the largest elsewhere known, so do most of Alaska’s mineral de, posits exceed those elsewhere known., Alaska could readily support a pop, ulation of from twenty to thirty to the, square mile, or over 11,000,000. She, has less than 30,000. Sweden has a, population of thirty-one to the square, mile and Norway eighteen to the, square mile. Russia has ten prov, inces lying farther north than Anch, orage, and these ten provinces have a, population of over 5,000,000. The basic, industries of these far northern coun, tries, like that of Alaska, is mineral, production, but agriculture is by no, means neglected. The farms of these, countries, having about the same cli, matic conditions as Alaska, produce a, larger average per acre of grain crops, than southern European countries., SCENES OF CONFUSION, IN PARIS STATIONS, PARIS, Jan. 14 (Correspondence of, the Associated Press).—The railway, stations of Paris are piled high with, American baggage these days. Moun, tains of bedding, rolls, locker trunks, and the customary belonging# of the, officer, block every spare space, for, these men are in exodus home They, represent very largely the officer, personnel not now attached to units,, traveling separately and trying to, reach ports of embarkation. Because, of this they have to use the* regular, trains and other Of travel, and transfer across the city., Porters are few in Paris railway, stations. Those that exist are old, men or wounded men, so it is: not un, usual to see a colonel or two wrest, ling with his own: baggage side by, side with a whole* squad\' of soldiers.., Then comes the hunt for a taxicab,, which is even more rare than the, porter and, usually, lacking- any, French, these Americans have-no easy, time getting out of one station to an, other., But they manage it after a fashion, with the help of the American mili, tary police; whose red\' hats-, and1 bras, sards are numerous in all the depots;., -+_, The Daily Times Job plant is, well equipped for all classe of comi, mercial printing;, -*, Advertise in H»e Daily Times>, Mr. Business, Man, *, By the recent addition of many new, type faces and other equipment we have, made of our JOB DEPARTMENT one, of the finest in Alaska.

At this, time of all others should America, sing, when she has just emerged vic, torious from the bloody field of battle., The Cordova public school should, join in the observance of this national, song festival during the coming week, by giving extra time and attention to, the singing of patriotic and folk songs, of our land., * * *, Dr. T.

J. White, has been receiving a great many in, quiries, particularly from the east, as, the result of a letter he recently wrote, to the Christian Science Monitor of, Boston. The letter is entitled “Oppor, tunities in Alaska,” and the responses, to it indicate that there is a great deal, of interest in this territory through, out the country., As a result of the letter Mr. White, has been requested to write an article, j for a New York magazine, setting, forth more in detail the opportunities, for young men in Alaska. This he, will do at once., Mr. White’s letter which appeared, in the Christian Science Monitor is, as follows:, To the Editor of the Christian Science, Monitor:, Now that the war is over, and hun, dreds of thousands of young men are, being dismissed from military serv, ice, young men who, being imbued, with the spirit of adventure, will not, be content to return to their former, prosaic lives, a few words of what, Alaska has to offer them are not out, of place at this time., Alaska is America’s last frontier,, and the department with which the, writer is connected le already receiv, ing many letters from soldiers and, sailors about to be discharged from, the service, and who are anxious to, acquire information about this coun, try, with the view of coming here to, make their future homes., While Alaska has hundreds of mil, lions of acres available to settlers, the, proposition looking to “community, settlements,” which is now being, worked out by the Reclamation Serv, ive of the Department of the Interior, of the United States, is not feasible to, mia uuuuuy, uic Manic as it win utj, in many of the states in which are, vast areas of swamp land which it is ., proposed to reclaim for agricultural, purposes and for homes for returned, soldiers. The reason this system will, not succeed in Alaska is that, to make, a success of agriculture there must be, markets for the products, and the, population of Alaska is as yet too, small to constitute such market, and, the distance to cities along the Pacific, coast is so great that Alaska products, could not be shipped with success or, in competition with what those states, produce within their own confines., Farming, therefore, in Alaska is not, an inducement to be held out to our, returned soldiers and sailors., However, several thousand young, men can be provided for here by our, principal Industries, which are com, mercial, mining, fishing and lumber, ing, of which all but that of fishing, are steady, twelve months in the year,, and year in and year out. All of these, industries ate and have been operat, ing on short labor ever since the, United States entered the war. Also, all of these industries are now await, ing the return of those who left, as, well as the arrival of new men, in or, der that normal conditions may be re, sumed and the volume of business In, creased at the earliest possible date., It Is conservative to state that 6000, young men can be furnished with re, munerative employment in Alaska, during the first four months of the, new year, but it Is not desired that, they- all come at once, or even In, bunches of several hundred. But by a, few arriving with every steamer from, the south, they can be absorbed and, provided for by the country without, any congestion. Also, and as soon as, normal prices obtain, a number of, low-grade mining propositions which, cannot be operated on account of the, high cost, both of material and labor,, will again become active, and at least, another 6000 men will be required., Again, the opportunities In Alaska, for young men to get Into business for, for themselves are many and varied,, and the result is that the business in, dustries of the territory are con, stantly increasing and the scope for, the employment of labor steadily, broadening., Alaska will welcome returned war, heroes with open arms, and will put, them in line to do something for, themselves, but they must not come, here with the idea that gold nuggets, can be clucked from trees. Robert, W. Service had the right line on Al, aska when he wrote:, “There are hardshops which nobody, reckons;, There are valleys unpeopled and still;, There is a land—oh, it beckons and, beckons,, And I want to go there^-and I will.\'\', (Signed) B.

The soldier on leave car, not reach London in a few hours al, an expenditure of little or nothing, Japan is thirty hours away, and the, fare to Yokohama is some $30, and, even then the respite-seeker Is in a, strange land. For his amusement the, officer or private in Siberia is thrown, much upon his own resources and, must “live off the country.”, The English-speaking families of, Vladivostok have been extremely kind, to the troops, throwing their homes, open frequently to both officers and, other ranks, and each week there is, at least one concert arranged at the, barracks of the various units of the, Y. M. C. A. or other agency. One, British unit has a concert party that, would scarcely be beaten on the regu, lar vaudeville circuits, while the Czech, force possesses an orchestra of some, fifty pieces made up of talented mu, sicians and always ready to oblige., The city itself holds attractions that, serve to pass the time away, at least, so long as they retain the virtue of, novelty., Vladivostok was a gay town in im, perial days, just as any garrison town, is gay. Even yet, despite the slings, and arrows of outrageous fortune,, there is a circus, for instance, all the, time, to the delight of the Russian, youth. There are movies, too, al, though these are not as numerous as, in a Canadian city of the size, and a, theater,-the Golden Horn, which pre, sents pictures in the afternoon and, drama in the evening. Dances and, concerts are of frequent occurrence,, and allied soldiers are always wel, comed—if they have the price of ad, mission., The hand of the Anglo-Saxon is seen, in the renaming of the Vladivostok, restaurants, which are here, as in all, Russian cities, important and well, patronized institutions. Kokken’s, one, of the leading cafes on the main street,, Svetlaaskaya, has thus become the, Olympus. Other popular resorts are, the Aquarium, the Golden Anchor and, the Solitary Dog., The Solitary Dog, from the point, of view of etymology, deserves special, mention. Golden Horn is the strip, of water front that provides Vladivo, stok with a harbor, and the Russian, name for Golden Horn is Solitoi Rog., In the Russian characters the “R” is, like the Roman “P,” so it was emi, nently natural that the Golden Horn, cafe—the Solitoi Rog—should become, Anglicized as the Solitary Dog. It is, a popular resort for officers for after, noon tea, for here everybody culti, vates a taste for the Russian “chei,”, served in a glass with lemon and, sugar., me nussian Knows now to eat, ana, the cafes are full at any hour of the, day or night. All the hundred and, one types of officers and civilians may, be studied at leisure from a restaurant, table, for one is never in a hurry, here. A “quick lunch” house would, be a dismal failure in Siberia. One, may rub shoulders with Russian gen, erals bedecked with medals, with, Czech, French and Italian officers,, and there is always sure to ’,e a sprin, kling of Canadians and Americans., Some of the restaurants have taken, to printing their\' menus in Russian, and English, but English study has, not yet advanced very far, and some, times it is less difficult to understand, the Russian version. Language dif, ficulties mar enjoyment somewhat, al, though there is sure to be somebody, in each place who understands French,, if not English, and the sign language, will go far., Making change is always a toil, gome affair, and for the recipient of, the change, decidedly risky. Give a, waiter a 40-ruble note to pay for a, meal and you receive in change a, mass of paper that is well worth look, ing into. Interest coupons torn from, various domestic loan bond issues are, circulated as currency. They are good, if they have reached the date of ma, turity, but if they are to mature next, year or the year after they are worth, less as currency. Many Canadians, have now in their possession bunches, of coupons maturing in 1919, 1920 and, 1921. Even the bonds themselves are, handed about as money. In fact, ev- ., erything but real money may be ob, tained. When the cashier at a cafe, is unable to make the proper change, he gives you a chit for the balance. », This chit Is accepted in payment for, a meal next time you go to the place., Kokken’s is famous for this method,, and there is a great deal of “Kokken, money" floating about among the, troops., At thp present writing It is almost, as difficult to secure liquor in Vladi, vostok as it is in Toronto, Winnipeg, or Vancouver. The only brand gen, erally sold in cafes is a light beer—, “water beer”—about as potent as the, famous “two per cent” of the Cana, dian “dry" belt. At one or two places, French cognac may be obtained at, fabulous prices. Vladivostok is to, all intents and purposes “dry,” al, i though there are, of course, bootleg, gers who vend a fiendish substance, which they describe erroneously as, 1 vodka. The real vodka, with the im, perial seal, is found in some private, cellars, and is more or less like Cana, dian white wheat whisky. The boot, leggers’ brand is methylated spirits, and water, and kills every week a few, of the brave souls who are willing to, tackle it., The* Aquarium is a typically Rus, sian institution, a combination of the, ater and restaurant, where the show, begins at 11 o’clock at night and ends, at 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning. The, Russian is a notorious night hawk., The program is like that of the ordi, nary variety show—dancing, singing,, and the like—while the audience sit, about at little tables and eat and, drink. Eating and drinking always, are in order. When off duty the ac, tresses circulate among the tables and, fraternize with the spectators., The Russian dances attract large, numbers of Canadian and American, officers, although dancing after the, Russian style is a science that must, be acquired slowly and prayerfully., The waltz is very fast, and there is, no reverse. The ball begins with a, concert, usually excellent, which lasts, until midnight, with one or two inter, missions during which the guests go, out to the refreshment rooms and eat., Then the dancing follows, lasting un, til 4 or 5 in the morning. The one, step is being acquired since the ad, vent of the allies from America, and 1, the repertoire Spanish dances, a spe- 1, cies of two-step, and many ^ curious ^, and pretty Russian figures. Every (, Russian is a born dancer, and the or- ,, dinary concert program includes one i, or more accomplished danseuses. i, | Legal Advertising | 1, NOTICE OF SETTLEMENT OF, ACCOUNT, In the United States Commissioner’s, Court, Cordova Precinct, Territory, of Alaska (In Probate)., In the Matter of the Estate of Gun, nard Johnson, Deceased., Notice is hereby given that V.- G., Vance, administrator of the estate of, Gunnard Johnson, deceased, has ren, dered and presented for settlement to,, and filed in the probate court of said, Cordova precinct, his final account as, such administrator, and that Tuesday,, the 15th day of April, 1919, at 10, o\'clock a. m., at the court room of our, said probate court at Cordova, Alaska,, has been duly appointed by the pro, bate court for the settlement of the, final account, at which time and place, any person interested in said estate, may appear and file his exceptions in, writing to the said final account and, contest the same., Witness the Hon., (Seal) A.

It was in 1527 that the Span, ish captain-geperal, Fernando Cortez,, sent one of Balboa’s veterans, Alvera, de Saavedra, from Tehuantepec, on, the west coast of Mexico, with in, structions to try to find a strait sup, posed at that time to form a link in, a route from Mexico, or New Spain,, as it was then known, to the newly, discovered Spice islands, known to, later generations as the Philippines., From Cortez’ time down to the pres, ent there have passed in review, through the pages of Lower Califor, nia’s history Spanish conquerors, Jes, uits, Dominicans and Franciscans, and, plunderers from many lands; United, States troops during the war with, Mexico; filibusters intent on setting, up an independent government, and, lastly, the contending factions for su, premacy in Mexico’s national admin, istration since the overthrow of Por, nrio uiaz as president., It was Diaz who bestowed on Lower, California the title of “pobre Baja, , California,” descriptive of her con, dition in recent years, and which,, translated, means "poor Lower Cali, fornia.”, Diaz’ description fits the country, just as well as to its topographical, aspects, and in some other respects,, for it is a jagged peninsula, 760 miles, long, carying in width from 30 to 150, miles, and traversed throughout its, length by an irregular ranage of bar, ren mountains of volcanic origin,, breaking off abruptly on the Onlf side, and rambling off in a series of low, hills to the Pacific coast. It has been, described by its most recent explorer, as "a land great in its past and lean, in its present; a land where the rat, tlesnake and the sidewinder, the tar, antula and the scorpion multiply, and, where sickness is unknown and five, score years is no uncommon span of, life—a land of strange contradictions.”, While a territorial state of Mexico,, it nowhere touches other Mexican soil,, being separated from the mainland, by the waters of the Colorado river, and the Gulf of California. In 1910, the population of the entire peninsula, was given at 52,244. There is but, one railroad in the country, aside from, "wheezy” mine tramways, and that, one from Mexicali to Yuma, hut sixty, three miles in length. The "camlnos,”, or roads, of the mission days have, fallen into wretched state, and in, many places have been practically, obliterated., The peninsula Is rich in mineral, wealth, at least one of its silver mines, in the southern district having been, operated since 1748. Gold, silver, cop, per, iron, coal, lead, gypsum and salt, are found, and valuable marble for, building is everywhere abundant. Min, ing experts agree that the mineral re, sources have hardly been scratched., Cactus and mesquite have given, place in valleys where irrigation has, been possible to the cultivation of, deciduous fruits, figs, dates, cereals, and vegetables. Rainfall is scanty, and insufficient to support vegetation., Tobacco, cotton, grapes, sugar cane, and native melons are grown. Horses, and cattle, as well as sheep in lim, ited numbers, are found in the most, fertile valleys., The pearl fisheries of La Paz, on, the Gulf side, have been worked since, the first Spanish landed, and have, netted fortunes to those who have, succeeded to the franchises covering, the fisheries. Whale fishing has been, carried on successfully for more than, a hundred years off Magdalena bay,, on the Pacific side, which has fur, nished also a ground for target prac, tice for the warships of the United, States., The Californias, Baja and Alta Cali, fornia, the latter the state north of, the Mexican boundary, were chris, tened from a Spanish romance popu, lar in the time of Cortez, entitled, “Sergas de Esplanadian,” in which the, island of California was mentioned as, situated “on the right hand of the, Indies, very near terrestial Paradise.”, The first parment settlement on the, peninsula was founded at Loretto in, 1697 by Jesuits, who afterwards estab, lished a settlement at La Paz. After, the expulsion of the Jesuits the Fran, ciscans were allowed to carry on their, missionary work, and later the Do, minican monks were granted similar, privileges., ruuuwiug cue aiuuug tii« muic un, portant events of historical interest, from the landing of the Spaniards, down to the overthrow of President, Porfirio Diaz, in 1911:, 1579—Coast visited by Sir Francis, Drake., 1633-83—Five unsuccessful attempts, made to establish settlements., 1697—Jesuits found Lorett mission., Pious fund, for the maintenance of, missions, founded., 1751—First wine grapes planted by, Jesuits., 1767— Jesuits expelled after having, founded twenty-five missions, fourteen, of them successful., 1768— Franciscans permitted to en, gage in missionary work on penin, sula., 1772—Dominican monks given same, rights as Franciscans., 1802—Monthly mail route estab, lished over El Camlno Real., 1822—Admiral Lord Cochrane plun, dered San Jose del Dabo, Loretto and, Todos gantos., 1847— United States declared war, against Mexico. Troops occupy Todos, Santos, La Paz and other points., 1848— War ended with treaty, of, Guadalupe Hidalgo., 1853—William Walker of San Fran, cisco led filibustering expedition into, peninsula and captured La Paz. Un, dertook to set up independent state,, including Sonora and Lower Califor, nia. Walker tried in San Francisco, and acquitted after failure of expedi, tion., 1855—Santo Domingo mission last, one given up by Franciscans after, secularization act. Penal colonies, established at La Paz and on Carman, island., 1859—President Buchanan sent en, voy to President Juarez of Mexico to, negotiate purchase of Lower Califor, nia. Juarez refused to sanction sale., 1879—Marquis de Leon organized, revolution, which died within a year., 1879—Lower California divided Into, two districts, with La Paz as the cap, ital of the South and Ensenada as, capital of the North., Successive revolutions which have, held Mexico in the throes since Por, firio Diaz resigned, in May, 1911, have, not greatly disturbed Lower Califor, nia, except for the effect brought about, by changing administrations. Aside, from filibustering raids charged to, Americans, occurring at Tia Juana, and Mexicali, in 1911, whatever, trouble has occurred has been of In, significant proportions. Selso Vega, was Jefe politico of the northern dis, trict under Diaz. Francisco Madero,, when he assumed the reins of Mexi, can government, appointed General, Vasquez in Mega\'s place., General Esteban Cantu, now mili, tary governor of the northern district,, assumed charge of affairs after ar, riving at Mexicali, in 1911, and with, his consent Villa appointed General, Avllez in 1915 as jefe politico of the, district. general Aviles and Cantu, split over Aviles’ efforts to popularize, Villa\'s paper money, and Cantu as, sumed control of both affairs of state, and military matters of the district., The southern district is under the ad, ministration of General Angulo, an ar, dent Carransa adherent., --• ■ ■, ALASKA STEAMSHIP CO., Regular Sailings eBtween Seattle,, Ketchikan, Juneau, Cordova, Valdez,, Ellamar, Liecum, Latouche and, 8eward, Prom Seattle Due Cordova, 15 ALAMEDA 20, 25 ALASKA March 2, Note.—Steamer Alaska does not go west of Cordova,, frequent sailings of freighters carrying explosives, This schedule subject to change without notice., F.

The, fur forms the collar\' and cuffs, and, when used on the skirt or tunic Is, generally put on in patches., Take, for instance, a smart street, frock of beaver color duvetyn with, its patches of beaver, trimming the, panels that hang from the wnistline, at the back and front. The cuffs and, high collar are also of the beaver., The lower part of the bodice is inset, with a square of embroidery in brown, and dull gold thread. Directly at the, front and back underneath the two, fur-trimmed panels Is a larger panel, of the material, decorated at the hem, with cord tucking., Another extremely smart frock is, of brown velveteen, trimmed with nu, tria. The model is made with a long, tunic, which is slit at the sides and, trimmed at the edges with nutria. The, tunic is set on to a loose-fitting back,, which is drawn in slightly at the waist, line with a sash, which encircles the, waist, crossing at the front and loosely, at the back, the ends being finished, with tassels. The large collar, cuffs, and the draped toque are of nutria., Velvets are being used more and, more for Indoor gowns, as well as for, the street frock. Many beautiful din, ner gowns are ^^^^medfrom velvet, Fur Cuffs and Collar., In the softest and most supple of, weaves. These lovely velvets drape,, but do not crush, 9. rare attribute In, any fabric of this nature., Often georgette crepe or chiffon Is, used In combination with the velvet, The crepe or chiffon, for Instance, may, form the sleeves and part of the bodice, while the velvet Is used as a part of, the bodice and skirt. Or the crepe, may form an overtunlc, as In the case, of one lovely model, and the underskirt, of velvet., USE OF FUR FOR TRIMMING, Stylish Decoration Figures Conspicu, ously on Majority of Winter, 8ulta and Wraps., Almost every suit or wrap this win, ter* has Its bit of fur trimming. In, some instances the fur trimming forms, almost half the garment. A lovely, wrap recently seen was of henna red, velours with an enormous beaver col, lar which when opened formed a cape, effect. A deep band of the beaver, trimmed the coat at the lower part,, extending up one-third of the coat, length., The accompanying hat was of, beaver decorated with a feather orna, ment of henna red., Jaunty little Eton coats of fur often, complete a costume of cloth. An ex, ample is a costume of soft, warm wool, velours, which has almost the warmth, of a wrap which may be made com, fortable enough for even average win, ter weather by the addition of a smart, little coat of fur. Narrow bands of, the fur could be used to trim the frock., Different Aprons. ., Inhere is infinite variety of aprons;, they are either of chiffon embroidered ,, like the front of the corsage, Which, continues in two points around the, wslkt, or else they are made with a, fichu to match, so as to connect with, the waist, Y \\, 4, MAKE A BEGINNING, After you have made a start you will not find It very difficult, to add a little to your savings each month.
