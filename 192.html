L, Smith this morning to ask that theft, names be taken from the petition., No reason for their action was given, to the court. The hearing on the, original petition was reset for April, 23., W. B. Owen, chairman of the state, highway department, attended the, meeting this morning, held in the of-\', fice of County Clerk John Reeves, and, made a short address, urging those, who asked that their names be strick, en from the original petition to re, consider their actions. Mr. Owen has, just returned from a business visit to, Washington, D. C., where he went to, secure information in regard to the, federal aid for state roads. He said, that he could insure the people that, the government would allow $10,000, toward building the Conway-Saltillo, road, leaving only $31,970 for the tax, payers to expend. This amount, would reduce the tax on each acre, about two cents, or from nine to, seven cents, it is said., Although the opponents of the or, ganization stated no reasons for be, ing against the proposition at today’s, meeting, one large landowner in the, proposed district told a reporter that, they are afraid of unequal assess, ments. Also it is said some object, on the ground that property farther, from Conway will be assessed less, than that near here, which they be, lieve is unjust., However, should the names of the, 31 who object to the improvement be, stricken from the petition, it is said, there still will remain a sufficient, number of signers to insure the or, ganization., The commissioners for the improve, ment district, Wm. J. Grummer, E. F., Park and J. L. Phillips, have agreed, to serve without remuneration., CHILDREN\'S HOME, REPRESENTATIVE HERE, Rev. O. P. Christian, State Super, intendent Arkansas Children’s Home, Society is in the city in the interest, of the society. Rev. D. J.

WILSON’S ESTIMATE, Conway Engineer Submits Fgures on, Average Cost Per Year of, Conway-Vilonia Road., •it —, That the Conway-Vilonia highway, may be constructed at an average, cost of nine cents per acre per year, to the farm lands within the district, in the statement of B. G. Wilson, a, Conway engineer, in an estimate, given at the request of O. C. Simpson, of Vilonia. The total cost, including, interest, will not exceed an average, of $1.80 per acre, Mr. Wilson states,, and if this is divided into 20\'arvnual, payments the average per year will, be nine cents an acre. He gives this, as the maximum, and says the cost, may not exceed eight cents per acre., As he has had numerous other in, quiries regarding the proposed road,, Mr. Wilson kindly furnished the Log, Cabin Democrat with a copy of his, letter to Mr. Simpson, in order that, others interested might have the, benefit of his estimate. His letter, follows:, Conway, Ark., March 21, 1917., Mr. O. C. Simpson, Vilonia, Ark., Dear Oscar—Replying to your in, quiry as to the distribution of ex, pense in the construction of the pro, posed Conway-Vilonia-White county, road, beg to advise that I do not own, property in the district, therefore, would not try to influence you either, for or against the formation of the, district, though for your information, will say:, The district could only spend on, this work the amount of the estimate, as returned by the highway engi, neers, plus 6 per cent annual interest, on the bonds, which are shown by the, figures below:, Highway estimate _.r_$110,371.57, 0 per cent interest for, the average time_ 66,222.94, Total_ $176,594.51, This you will note is the annual, payment plan of paying the interest, and reducing the principal each yar, Now calculated on a percentage, basis the valuations as shown in the, town of Vilonia and that portion of, Donway included in the district would, be __ __$ 36,482.51, which leaves, to be taxed, against farm lands_140,112,00, as afore _1._$176,594.51, We now divide this amount by the, number of acres in the district, that, is, 140,112.00 by 77.840 equals $1.80,, which divided by 20 payments shows, total net cost per acre of 9 cents., Under the laws the district cannot, spend more than shown above (and, in my opinion your road can be built, for less) then as the assessment must, take into consideration the value of, improvements and the tax levied ac, cording to the benefits received the, cost may be reduced, possibly as low, as 8 cents per acre averages., The laws also require construction, bonds of the contractors of double the, contract price, so you see if the work, is once begun it will have to be com, pleted., Hoping this clearly conveys to you, the cost of the proposed improve, ment, 1 am, yours truly,, B.

Hospital., Special to the Log Cabin Democrat., Shreveport, La., March 22.—Lee, Blount, the Faulkner coiEnty, Ark.,, bandit, murderer and bank robber,, died at 7:45 o’clock last night at the, Shreveport Charity hospital, from, wounds he sustained at the hands of, a posse following the robbery of the, bank of Collinston February 23., The body has been turned over to, a local undertaker to be embalmed, and sent to his home at Mayflower,, Ark., at the request of his wife., Blount suffered a smothering spell, early yesterday morning. He appar, ently realized that death was cer, tain. He sank into a stupor later in, the day and remained in that condi, tion until he died., Blount’s criminal career was be, gun about eight years ago, when he, was sentenced to a term in the pen, itentiary for robbery in White coun, ty. He served a part of his sentence,, and was pardoned by Governor Jeff, Davis., After leaving the penitentiary he, came to Mayflower, where he has re, sided since, making his living by, farming and trapping. He was a, law abiding citizen until about three, years ago, when he appeared upon, the street at Mayflower with a re, volver, forcing a negro to dance., While the negro was dancing, Blount, fired his pistol several times, one, of the bullets taking effect in the, black’s foot. A few days later he, shot another negro in tly; mouth., A warrant for his arrest was issued, by Justice George M. Easterwood of, Conway. John Cox, local barber, and deputy constable, was designated, to hrrest him., Cox went to his home, about a mile, west of Mayflower. When he at, tempted to take him into custody,, Blount drew a gun on the officer, dis, armed him and told him to “beat it.”, Cox returned to Conway and reported, the incident. Several officers, in, cluding Deputy Sheriff Oscar L., Honea, then went to Blount’s home, and placed him under arrest. Before, his arrest, Blount offered resistance, and Honea shot at him, but missed, his mark., On October 28, 1914, while in the, county jail here awaiting trial,, Blount and two other county prison, ers, Frank Honeycutt, white, and, Tom Traylor, negro, dug a hole in the, wall of the building and escaped., Hearing that he was at his home,, a posse was organized and pursued, him. Deputy Honea was a member, of the party. Blount took refuge in, a sage thicket As the officer ap, proached him, shortly after noon on, October 22, Blount fired pointblank,, killing Honea instantly. Seventeen, buckshots entered Honea’s breast,, five penetrating the heart. Sheriff, J. S. Johnson and Wash Clibourn,, who went with Honea to capture the, escaped prisoner, heard the report of, Blount’s gun. Hearing no response, when they called to him, they feared, the worst, finding his body about one, hour later. Blount made his escape., 1 reward oi ?owu was ottered tor, Blount’s arrest. Five weeks after, the killing, he returned to Mayflow, er, going to the home of his father, in-law, L. M. Meeks. The following, day Walter Meeks, a brother-in-law,, came to Conway and informed Cli, bourn that Blount would surrender, if protection from mob violence were, guaranteed. Clibourne accompanied, Meeks to Mayflower, and met Blount, in the woods near his home, talking, with him about an hour. It was so, arranged that Clibourne, Sherifl, Johnson and Deputy C. O. Payne, would go to Little Rock on the morn, ing accommodation train, stopping, the train at the lower end of the, passing track at Mayflower, and, Blount would surrender. True to, his promise, when the train stopped, Blount came out of the woods and, was placed under arrest. He was, taken to the state penitentiary at, Little Rock for safe keeping., Walter Meeks and John Boyles,, relatives of Blount, were arrested on, charges of assisting Blount to escape,, but later were relased., Blount was indicted by the Faulk, ner county grand jury for murder, in the first degree on January 14., Unable to employ counsel, the court, appointed Attorneys J. C. Clark and, A. L. Barber of the local bar. The, case was set for trial at a special, term of court, which convened on, March 10, 1915. Blount entered a, plea of not guilty at the January, term of court. The defendant plead, OFFERING, Dr. McMahan Clifton Street dwelling. Beauti, ful home.

The slayer, was given 18 years in the peniten, tiary. Six ballots were taken before, a verdict was reached. J. B. Read,, prosecuting attorney, was assisted, by Col. G. W. Bruce., Blount was among the prisoners, who escaped from the state farm at, Tucker January 20, 1916. He was, captured and returned to the farm, January 25. He again escaped June, 12 and on June 14 was captured and, returned a second time to the state, farm. January 31 Blount and, “Shorty” Defts fled from the farm at, Tucker., Blount had been made a trusty, guard and was in charge of a gang, of a dozen men clearing ground., He carried a shotgun, which he lev, eled at Jack Van Diver, riding, guard, in charge of Blount\'s and, other gangs, commanding him to, throw up his hands. Van Diver, failed to obey at once and Blount, fired at close range, a portion of, Van Diver’s clothing being torn, away. Defts then took Van Diver\'s, automatic revolver, and together, he and Blount fled to the timber near, t>y, as other riding guards came to, j Van Diver’s assistance.

The warrant was, for $300, and was to apply “on error, on five cars of brick.” The brick was, used in the construction of school, buildings some time ago., Auditor Oliver took the ground, that there was no specific appropria, tion under which he could legally is, sue the warrant. He consulted At, torney General Arbuckle and was, there informed that not only could, this voucher not be paid, but that all, warrants issued on the fund in the, past two years were illegal., The assembly of 1915 required all, the agricultural schools to pay into, the treasury the receipts from the, products of the farms. This was to, go into a separate fund for the bene, fit of the schools. The legislature, then attempted to re-appropriate the, money so that it could again be, drawn, the object being merely to, keep a check on the schools, but in, this it failed. The appropriation, ac, cording to Attorney General Ar, buckle, must be specific in dollars and, cents.

Robins, Editor., By Carrier-60 Cents Per Month, By Mail.$3.60 Per Year, •J* •?«, 4* THE NATIONAL GUARD *, •i* IN CONWAY. .J., 4* 4*, The Log Cabin Democrat is in, hearty sympathy with the movement, headed by Dr. J. Z. Bailey and others, of this city to organize a local com, pany of the national guard. Events, of the past two and a half years have, proved beyond a doubt that a nation, to command the respect of the rest, of the world must be ready if neces, sary to maintain its rights with the, sword. Disarmament may—and it is, devoutedly to be hoped that it will, come at the end of the present world, wide struggle, but until it does come, it is foolhardy for the United States, to remain unprepared. The Puritan, fathers did not cease to carry their -, guns with them to church until there, was no longer danger from maraud, ing Indians. Neither can our nation, afford to lay down its arms and ex, pose its helplessness while two-thirds, of the world is war-mad., It is an evidence of fine patriotism, when a young man volunteers to, serve his country by bearing arms for, it. We no longer deride the members, of the guard as “tin soldiers,” but,, except in time of war, we do not ac, cord them the respect they are due., In the older states to be chosen a, mmber of many of the companies of, the national guard is a distinguished, honor. Some of them are able to, trace a contiuous organization from, the days of the American revolution, and membership in such a company, is a coveted distinction. While there, would be no touch of aristocracy in, a Conway company, the very fact that, it would be essentially democratic, would only add to the honor which it, would give to its men., We hope that Dr. Bailey’s efforts, will meet with success and that every, man who is eligible and qualified for, service, and who is not withheld by, the support of dependent families,, will enlist in the Conway company of, national guard. Those who are not, so fitted for enlistment can aid by, lending their support and encourage, ment, by according the company the, respect and admiration which will be, due it and by assisting in making the, surroundings of the company as, pleasant, attractive and uplifting as, it is possible to do., JNO.
