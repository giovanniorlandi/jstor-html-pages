Today, the rate and volume of human use of natural resources \nare increasing at a very high speed. Pumping out huge amounts of oil and \ngas from the Earth\'s interior, which cannot quickly recover, no one \ncalculated how this, for example, would affect all the parameters of the \nmovement of our planet and, accordingly, the change in the living \nconditions of people. Cutting down forests and building dams on rivers, no \none calculated how this would affect climate change on the Earth in the \nfuture, etc. At the same time, the economic activity of organizations under \ncompetition in various fields of activity, including interstate, aimed at \nactivating people\'s consumer behavior, increasingly aggravates the already \ndifficult environmental situation, and the mainland of the Earth, the world \nocean, and the near space began to turn into a "garbage dump" from the \nresults of human activities and production waste. And as a result, humanity \nfaces the issue of its survival on the Earth, associated with the need for \nrational use of natural resources and their timely reproduction as a key \nfactor in its economic development. Today it is necessary to develop and \nimplement the concept of responsible consumption in people\'s economic \nactivities, which enables to take care of the world\'s natural resources and to \nexclude the possibility of an environmental catastrophe associated with the \n"littering" of their habitat. \n1 Introduction \nAt present, the development of both the national and the world economy requires the \nincreasing use of natural resources. At the same time, in the middle of the twentieth \ncentury, the need to use natural resources in the interests of economic development "relied" \non the thesis of I.V. Michurin that "we cannot wait for the mercies of nature. It is our task \nto take them" [1]. Unfortunately, this has been taken literally. But, as noted by A. \nSokhansky, "after getting acquainted with the life and legacy of the scientist, these words \ndo not seem to be the consumer slogan at all. The catch phrase of I.V. Michurin does not \ncall for taking an axe and cutting down trees in the garden to make it easier to collect fruit \nfrom them, or using a chainsaw to cut down cedars in the taiga to quickly fill bags with \n© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

A person can and should use natural resources to solve their problems since the \ndevelopment of modern society as a consumer society requires the use and transformation \nof the necessary natural resources in the interests of meeting the needs of people. However, \nthe present increase in the rate and volume of human consumption of resources can be \ncompared to their destruction. Even 50 years ago, it was not clear why people had to buy \ndrinking water, when there were rivers and lakes with fresh water around. Today, people \nare already afraid to drink water, as the water in the rivers becomes undrinkable due to the \nfault of people. The relevance of the topic under consideration is determined by the fact that \ntoday the search for new sources of natural resources, their conservation, and multiplication \nis becoming the main condition for the survival of people on the Earth.  \nThe article identifies the current problems associated with the implementation of the \nscientific concept of responsible consumption, which allows optimal use of the world\'s \nnatural resources in the interests of the development of both the world economy and \nnational economies while maintaining the ecological balance in nature.  \n2 Materials and Methods \nTo study the problems of conservation and rational use of natural resources in the interests \nof the development of the world and national economies, a review of scientific publications \non the topic under consideration was conducted, analytical and statistical information on the \nresults of organizations\' activities in modern conditions was studied, and interviews were \nconducted with specialists at various levels of management of industrial organizations of \nthe real sector of the economy and environmental organizations of the Yaroslavl region as \none of the developed industrial regions of Russia. Research materials on this topic have \nbeen repeatedly submitted for discussion at various scientific and practical conferences and \n"round tables" held jointly by researchers and practitioners from organizations. \n3 Results and Discussion \nCurrently, there is a "war" between different countries for gaining access to cheap natural \nresources to achieve a competitive advantage in the development of national economies. \nAnd the United States is the most active in this "war". A striking example of this is the \nactions of the United States aimed at disrupting the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas \npipeline, organizing the "removal" of Rosatom from the contract in the Czech Republic for \nthe construction of a nuclear power plant in favor of American companies, and much more, \nunfounded claims for the right to use the Northern Sea Route in their interests, etc. [2]. At \nthe same time, the United States considers Russia as the main political and military \nopponent since it has large reserves of various resources and is a major supplier of them. \nHowever, today we are sure that Russia cannot use its natural resources without \nscientifically based provisions. For example, the Minister of Natural Resources and \nEcology A. Kozlov noted that, "At the current production levels, Russia will have oil \nreserves for 59 years, and natural gas – for 103 years. And the Head of the Federal Agency \nfor Subsoil Use (Rosnedr) E. Kiselyov told Rossiyskaya Gazeta in April 2020 that Russia \nhad oil reserves for 58 years (with only 19 profitable years) and gas reserves for more than \n60 years [3].  \nThis also applies to forest resources. For example, deforestation is caused by the \ntransformation of woodlands into land for farming, construction of roads to remote places \nand various pipelines, construction of housing, factories, growing demand for forest \nproducts, and providing consumers with wood and paper, etc. It is a well-known fact that \nforests cover 31% of the territory of our planet.

For example, deforestation is caused by the \ntransformation of woodlands into land for farming, construction of roads to remote places \nand various pipelines, construction of housing, factories, growing demand for forest \nproducts, and providing consumers with wood and paper, etc. It is a well-known fact that \nforests cover 31% of the territory of our planet. In the Russian Federation (RF), the forest \narea is 814,931 thousand hectares (20% of the world\'s forest heritage), which is 50% of the \nterritory of Russia. Experts estimate that the world is currently losing more than 9 million \nhectares of forest a year. And this is the size of Portugal in terms of area. Deforestation not \nonly affects the climate, increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but also \nhas a huge impact on the environment, preventing water recycling, provoking severe \nflooding, depletion of aquifers, soil degradation, and disappearance of plant and animal \nspecies [4].  \nAnd fires in Russia, the United States, Spain, and Australia in the last few years alone \nhave destroyed millions of hectares of the forest while killing millions of different animals \nand birds living in these forests. For example, ecologists at the University of Sydney \nestimated that about half a billion birds, mammals, and reptiles died in wildfires in \nAustralia at the end of 2019. At the same time, according to ecologists, whole species of \nbirds and animals were destroyed together with the forests [5]. And fires destroy more and \nmore areas of the forest every year. According to the Audit Chamber of the Russian \nFederation, "about 300 thousand hectares of forest disappear in Russia every year. In 70% \nof cases, this is due to forest fires, the intensity of which has increased by 30-50% over the \npast 30 years, experts say" [14]. \n And today, they are already officially beginning to talk about the shortage of building \nmaterials from the forest in both Russian and foreign markets. At the same time, the \nMinistry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation is concerned about the current \nsituation and is working on the issue of including lumber in the list of goods that are \nessential for the domestic market, for which temporary restrictions or export bans may be \nestablished in exceptional cases [6]. And according to the latest report from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, lumber is currently the country\'s most obvious scarce commodity. \nIn a press release, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce states that "in the third quarter of 2020, \nmore than half of contractors reported a shortage of certain goods, while 11% of American \ncompanies reported a shortage of wood and lumber" [7]. \nUntil recently, people could not even imagine that they would need to buy drinking \nwater when there are rivers and lakes with fresh water. Nevertheless, the purchase of \ndrinking water is becoming commonplace in today\'s Russia. 50 years ago, Russians did not \neven think about buying drinking water in stores when there were rivers and lakes with \ndrinking water all around.  \nFor example, the Yaroslavl Center for Hydrometeorology and Environmental \nMonitoring published data from studies of the state and pollution of the environment for \n2019. The figures show that there is practically no clean water left in regional reservoirs \nused by most of the inhabitants. Experts conducted monitoring at two reservoirs, two lakes, \nand ten rivers of the Yaroslavl region. 85% of reservoirs have, according to the study, "very \npolluted" water: the Rybinsk and Gorky reservoirs (measurements were carried out on the \nVolga River in Rybinsk, Tutaev, and Yaroslavl) in the region, the Korozhechna, Yukhot, \nCheremukha, Kostroma, It, Kotorosl, Sot, Ukhra Rivers, and Lake Nero. Things are even \nworse in 7% of water bodies: water in the Rybinsk reservoir in the Breitov district and the \nSit River received the "dirty" category. If these results are compared with the results of the \nsame study of the Center for Hydrometeorology in 2018, it becomes clear that the state of \nreservoirs has deteriorated: back then only 57% of the water bodies of the region had "very \npolluted" water [8]. Today even bathing in many reservoirs is prohibited due to water \npollution and the likelihood of getting infectious diseases. And the deepest Lake Baikal \ntoday is on the verge of an ecological disaster, etc. In general, as noted in the report of the \nAudit Chamber of the RF, "almost all the rivers of the country are polluted with \nwastewater, while 88% of the water to be treated is discharged into the rivers in an \nimproper state" [14]. Therefore, today it is necessary to approach the use of fresh water \nsuitable for drinking from a scientific standpoint and very carefully, to take into account the \n3\nE3S Web of Conferences 291, 02015 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202129102015\nSDGG 2021\n', 'multiple risks and problems for each individual, national economies and even the whole of \nhumanity, so as not to turn the strategy of the development of society and the economy into \na strategy of accelerating its destruction. \nAt the same time, the world ocean today is becoming an environmentally dangerous \narea for human life. For example, Japan is currently planning to drain more than one \nmillion tons of radioactive water from the Fukushima-1 nuclear power plant, which was \ndestroyed in a nuclear accident in 2011 [9]. One can imagine the environmental \nconsequences of such activities and their negative impact on people and wildlife, when 1,15 \nmillion tons of polluted water, the storage of which is associated with huge costs and the \ncomplexity of the disposal process, will fall into the world ocean. Fish will swim in this \nwater, which can become infected with diseases and in the future, becoming dangerous for \npeople, can get into their food anywhere in the world. As the head of the public \norganization "Ecological Watch of Sakhalin" D. Lisitsyn told RIA Novosti, "the water drain \nfrom the Fukushima-1 emergency nuclear power plant in Japan will lead to the possible \nradioactive contamination in the center of the northern part of the Pacific Ocean, where \nPacific salmon are gaining weight" [10]. The ocean is often used by humans as the most \nconvenient place to get rid of various garbage and industrial waste. Everything from space \nstations that have served their time to household garbage is being drowned in the ocean. So, \nfor example, the Pacific Ocean has a giant island of garbage, which is already called "Great \nPacific Garbage Patch", "Pacific Trash Vortex", "Pacific Garbage Island", etc. It is growing \nat a gigantic pace, as every day about 2.5 million pieces of plastic and other garbage are \ndumped into the ocean from all continents. Such a "garbage island" causes irreparable \ndamage to the environment since birds, fish, and other ocean inhabitants take this plastic for \nfood. As a result, syringes, lighters, and toothbrushes are found in the stomachs of fallen \nseabirds, which the birds and fish swallow, mistaking them for food. This causes the death \nof more than 100 thousand marine mammals and the annual death of more than a million \nseabirds. And, unfortunately, there is a high probability that soon nothing can be fixed. \n[11]. \nThere is a "littering" of the Earth, near space, and the World Ocean with production \nwaste and improper disposal of used products. For example, according to the European \nSpace Agency (ESA), there are about 29 thousand fragments and debris up to 10 cm in size, \nabout 670 thousand fragments less than 10 cm in size, and more than 170 million fragments \nranging in size from 10 cm to 1 m with a total mass of up to 630 thousand tons [12]. \nBut problems with the disposal of garbage are already visible even on land. For \nexample, in the materials of the Audit Chamber of the Russian Federation on the results of \nmonitoring the national project "Ecology", it is said that "the volume of garbage in Russia \nis growing at such a pace that in 6 years the country will run out of landfills for the disposal \nof household waste". The report notes that "the volume of municipal waste is increasing at \nsuch a rate that in 6 years there will be no landfills for their disposal, and this will happen \nmuch earlier in some regions" [13]. The auditors of the Audit Chamber note, "the main \nproblem for the environment in Russia is not this garbage but the waste that is formed \nduring the extraction of minerals. The Audit Chamber refers to the data of the national \nstrategy for environmental safety, according to which, approximately 4 billion tons of \nproduction and consumption waste are generated in Russia annually, of which 55-60 \nmillion tons are solid municipal waste" [13]. In Russia, "the amount of waste that is not \ninvolved in secondary economic turnover is increasing but is placed in landfills and dumps, \nwhich leads to the withdrawal of productive agricultural land from circulation. About 15 \nthousand authorized waste disposal facilities occupy territories with a total area of about 4 \nmillion hectares, which increase annually by 300-400 thousand hectares", the document \nsays [13]. Back in the middle of the last century, the problem of depletion of the world\'s \nnatural resources and waste disposal was not as acute as it is today. "In a relatively short \n4\nE3S Web of Conferences 291, 02015 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202129102015\nSDGG 2021\n', 'multiple risks and problems for each individual, national economies and even the whole of \nhumanity, so as not to turn the strategy of the development of society and the economy into \na strategy of accelerating its destruction. \nAt the same time, the world ocean today is becoming an environmentally dangerous \narea for human life.

"In a relatively short \ntime, nature has shown that everything is cyclical in it. In the Middle Ages, people just \nthrew garbage out of the window and got the plague as a result. Europeans and Americans \ngot garbage islands in their territories and many other problems from the garbage that \narrived from Africa, which they also sent there", etc. [14]. And Russia also faces problems \nwith waste disposal. For example, in the materials of the Audit Chamber of the Russian \nFederation on the results of monitoring the national project "Ecology", it is said that "the \nvolume of garbage in Russia is growing at such a pace that in 6 years the country will run \nout of landfills for the disposal of household waste". The report notes that "the volume of \nmunicipal waste is increasing at such a rate that in 6 years there will be no landfills for their \ndisposal, and this will happen much earlier in some regions" [15]. The auditors of the Audit \nChamber note, "the main problem for the environment in Russia is not this garbage but the \nwaste that is formed during the extraction of minerals. The Audit Chamber refers to the \ndata of the national strategy for environmental safety, according to which, approximately 4 \nbillion tons of production and consumption waste are generated in Russia annually, of \nwhich 55-60 million tons are solid municipal waste". In Russia, "the amount of waste that is \nnot involved in secondary economic turnover is increasing but is placed in landfills and \ndumps, which leads to the withdrawal of productive agricultural land from circulation. \nAbout 15 thousand authorized waste disposal facilities occupy territories with a total area of \nabout 4 million hectares, which increase annually by 300-400 thousand hectares", the \ndocument says [15]. All this leads to "overspending" of natural resources. These problems \nare well-known in different countries that understand they need to be solved. And they even \nseem to be trying to do something in this direction. The rapid aggravation of problems of \nthe use of natural resources forces us to look for new approaches to overcome them.  \nThe analysis of the current situation with competition in the world market shows that \n"in modern conditions, characterized by the strengthening of the struggle of world \neconomies to seize positions in the most promising areas of scientific and technological \nprogress, the achievement of competitive advantages requires special, fundamentally and \nqualitatively different approaches than those set out in classical science", including the use \nof natural resources [16]. So, for example, as President of the United States, D. Trump \nsigned an executive order on the right of the United States to use the resources of the Moon \n[17]. As a result, the Russian scientist A.I. Subetto argues that today "we are talking about \nthe noospheric paradigm of technologism and industrialism, which would ensure the \nnoospheric harmony of the human economy on the Earth with the biogeocenoses, would \nensure the conservation, first of all, of such life-supporting ecosystems as soil, forest, \nfreshwater reservoirs (for example, Lake Baikal, Lake Ladoga, and Lake Onega in Russia), \nswamps, the World Ocean, especially the continental zones of the World Ocean, where \nplankton is reproduced – the most important producer of oxygen along with boreal forests" \n[18]. This actualizes the problems of rational use of natural resources for the development \nof both the world economy and national economies.  \nThese problems are quite complex and require a scientific and objective approach from \nthe standpoint of the interests and survival of all mankind. And a single country, no matter \nhow much it tries to work effectively to solve the problems outlined in the article, cannot \nsolve them alone. \nFirstly, the use of natural resources in the interests of economic development is often \npoliticized. As a result, there is a political struggle with the use of both military and \npolitical and economic methods on the part of the United States for access to natural \nresources. The United States is especially "hardworking" in this direction. For example, the \nUnited States is trying to extract and then sell shale gas instead of Russia in Europe, in \nevery possible way preventing the construction of the Nord Stream-2 pipeline. However, \nthe environmental damage from the extraction of such gas causes huge damage to nature. \nThus, experts and environmentalists claim that "drilling sites after the completion of work \n5\nE3S Web of Conferences 291, 02015 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202129102015\nSDGG 2021\n', 'resemble the sites of a nuclear disaster, turning into an environmental disaster zone". If the \nproblem of allocating areas for production and the associated environmental risks still do \nnot look so obvious for the United States with its vast and sparsely populated territories, \nthen the situation is quite different in Europe. The EU quickly realized the potential risks of \nshale gas production, which allowed critics of the "shale revolution" to say that the use of \nAmerican technologies is equivalent to exporting an environmental disaster to Europe and \nwill turn Europe into a "global burial ground" [19]. The mass media in the United States \nand a number of Western countries "promote" ideas of fair access to the world\'s natural \nresources. And, as they write, "what kind of world justice can we talk about when such a \nterritory as Siberia belongs to Russia alone?", "few people live in Siberia, and Lake Baikal \nis 30% of the world\'s fresh water reserves. So it\'s not fair that Baikal belongs to Russia. It \nshould be in the public domain! It would be right and democratic!" [20]. And today, the \nUnited States is trying to "take away" the Northern Sea Route from Russia. "The United \nStates has its eyes on the Russian Arctic and is actively pushing the idea that the Arctic \nspaces allegedly belong not to a country that goes to the Arctic seas with its shores and has \nthe largest Arctic coast but to a certain "world community". However, according to experts, \n"referring to the provisions on freedom of navigation of the UN Convention on the Law of \nthe Sea, the Americans forget that the United States itself has not signed this document" \n[21]. For example, former US President D. Trump signed an executive order canceling \ninitiatives to fulfill U.S. commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But, as A. \nNakhutin, Deputy Director of the Institute of Global Climate and Ecology of the \nRosgidromet of the RAS said, "the United States is such a major player in the climate game \n(and they account for 14.4% of global emissions) that any domestic decisions affect the \ninternational situation" in the field of environmental safety [22]. Thus, practice shows that \noften political issues and economic problems prevail over common sense, and many \ncountries and organizations try to solve these issues at no extra cost, caring not about the \nnecessary reproduction of natural resources to prevent irreversible processes in nature but \nhow to get access to natural resources in the interests of developing their national economy, \neven to the detriment of the interests of their partners. Today, this problem needs to be \nsolved radically, creating, perhaps, a structure similar to the UN, but in the field of \nenvironmental security in the world and the rational use of the world\'s natural resources. \nThe decisions of this organization should be binding on all countries without exception. \nToday there are structures of conservationists in many countries. \nSecondly, today all countries, in the interests of developing their national economies, \nare striving to increase consumer demand for their products. For this purpose, for example, \nconsumers have already formed a demand for disposable products. And modern people \ntoday are already actively using disposable dishes, disposable plastic bags in stores and for \ngarbage, shaving machines, disposable pens, and much more. There is a lot of information \non the Internet about the sale of such products. But, as practice shows, it is such disposable \nproducts that significantly increase the amount of garbage. For example, "the service life of \na package from 5 to 20 minutes is the time it takes us to bring this package home and throw \nit away. And it will decompose in nature for 200-500 years" [23]. Today, even long-term \ndemand goods, such as televisions and washing machines, are made "disposable" by \nmanufacturers, that is, such products are deliberately limited by manufacturers in terms of \noperation due to the introduction of technical innovations, and make their "planned by \nmanufacturer" repair expensive, etc. All this forces consumers to buy new products more \noften. Old products that could have increased serviced life are thrown into the trash. The \nactivist of "Eco-friendly. Kazan" and "No More Garbage" (Barnaul) E. Tertishnikova notes \nthat various sources name the figures of garbage that a person creates – from 400 to 1000 \nkg per person per year. Therefore, a person can send up to 10 tons of garbage to a landfill \nover 20 years of life [23]. However, it should be borne in mind that today the rejection of \n6\nE3S Web of Conferences 291, 02015 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202129102015\nSDGG 2021\n', 'resemble the sites of a nuclear disaster, turning into an environmental disaster zone". If the \nproblem of allocating areas for production and the associated environmental risks still do \nnot look so obvious for the United States with its vast and sparsely populated territories, \nthen the situation is quite different in Europe. The EU quickly realized the potential risks of \nshale gas production, which allowed critics of the "shale revolution" to say that the use of \nAmerican technologies is equivalent to exporting an environmental disaster to Europe and \nwill turn Europe into a "global burial ground" [19]. The mass media in the United States \nand a number of Western countries "promote" ideas of fair access to the world\'s natural \nresources. And, as they write, "what kind of world justice can we talk about when such a \nterritory as Siberia belongs to Russia alone?", "few people live in Siberia, and Lake Baikal \nis 30% of the world\'s fresh water reserves. So it\'s not fair that Baikal belongs to Russia. It \nshould be in the public domain! It would be right and democratic!" [20]. And today, the \nUnited States is trying to "take away" the Northern Sea Route from Russia. "The United \nStates has its eyes on the Russian Arctic and is actively pushing the idea that the Arctic \nspaces allegedly belong not to a country that goes to the Arctic seas with its shores and has \nthe largest Arctic coast but to a certain "world community". However, according to experts, \n"referring to the provisions on freedom of navigation of the UN Convention on the Law of \nthe Sea, the Americans forget that the United States itself has not signed this document" \n[21]. For example, former US President D. Trump signed an executive order canceling \ninitiatives to fulfill U.S. commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But, as A. \nNakhutin, Deputy Director of the Institute of Global Climate and Ecology of the \nRosgidromet of the RAS said, "the United States is such a major player in the climate game \n(and they account for 14.4% of global emissions) that any domestic decisions affect the \ninternational situation" in the field of environmental safety [22]. Thus, practice shows that \noften political issues and economic problems prevail over common sense, and many \ncountries and organizations try to solve these issues at no extra cost, caring not about the \nnecessary reproduction of natural resources to prevent irreversible processes in nature but \nhow to get access to natural resources in the interests of developing their national economy, \neven to the detriment of the interests of their partners. Today, this problem needs to be \nsolved radically, creating, perhaps, a structure similar to the UN, but in the field of \nenvironmental security in the world and the rational use of the world\'s natural resources. \nThe decisions of this organization should be binding on all countries without exception. \nToday there are structures of conservationists in many countries. \nSecondly, today all countries, in the interests of developing their national economies, \nare striving to increase consumer demand for their products. For this purpose, for example, \nconsumers have already formed a demand for disposable products. And modern people \ntoday are already actively using disposable dishes, disposable plastic bags in stores and for \ngarbage, shaving machines, disposable pens, and much more. There is a lot of information \non the Internet about the sale of such products. But, as practice shows, it is such disposable \nproducts that significantly increase the amount of garbage. For example, "the service life of \na package from 5 to 20 minutes is the time it takes us to bring this package home and throw \nit away. And it will decompose in nature for 200-500 years" [23]. Today, even long-term \ndemand goods, such as televisions and washing machines, are made "disposable" by \nmanufacturers, that is, such products are deliberately limited by manufacturers in terms of \noperation due to the introduction of technical innovations, and make their "planned by \nmanufacturer" repair expensive, etc. All this forces consumers to buy new products more \noften. Old products that could have increased serviced life are thrown into the trash. The \nactivist of "Eco-friendly. Kazan" and "No More Garbage" (Barnaul) E. Tertishnikova notes \nthat various sources name the figures of garbage that a person creates – from 400 to 1000 \nkg per person per year. Therefore, a person can send up to 10 tons of garbage to a landfill \nover 20 years of life [23]. However, it should be borne in mind that today the rejection of \nall disposable items is becoming a serious problem for many countries and organizations. \nThe report of the Audit Chamber of the Russian Federation "clarifies that the fight against \nthe problem of recycling the solid municipal waste in Russia can be ineffective without \npopularizing the use of reusable goods and containers" [14]. Very few resources used in the \nproduction of products are recycled, which increases the volume of both new volumes of \nnatural resources received by organizations and the amount of unreclaimed garbage. To \navoid the situation of creating more and more garbage dumps, product manufacturers shall \nbe responsible for the disposal of their products, creating a developed network of reception \npoints for products that have become unnecessary to consumers for their recycling for \nsecondary use. But it should be borne in mind that many countries and organizations \nactively sell their products to other countries. Accordingly, such a system of reception \npoints shall be accessible to all consumers around the world. But there are problems, firstly, \nof interstate regulation of such work, and secondly, of the struggle to get a profitable \nbusiness in the processing of natural resources for secondary use. Therefore, when solving \nthis problem, it is necessary to be guided not by corporate interests but the understanding \nthat the Earth is our common home and care for it should be shared. \nThirdly, today we need calculated and scientifically based standards for the use of world \nresources and fair quotas for states to extract and use them, taking into account the interests \nof not producers who are most concerned with profit but the needs to replenish the used \nnatural resources. As a result, world science is faced with the task of forming a concept of \nresponsible consumption aimed at ensuring that states do not seek to "snatch" natural \nresources in any way in the interests of the development of the national economy on the \nprinciple: "As if there were no tomorrow", but strive to pass on to future generations an \nenvironmentally friendly planet. An important task in the implementation of the concept of \nresponsible consumption will be the search for the application of the further use of the \nproducts of organizations that have a small life cycle, and the formation of people\'s beliefs \nin the expediency of their involvement in this activity.  \nFourthly, it shall be mentioned that the implementation of the ways we have shown to \nsolve the problems outlined in the article is often an expensive process, and as a result, is \nnot perceived by organizations since this reduces their profits. Nevertheless, an \norganization created on the basis of the UN principle to control the use of various natural \nresources could continuously monitor the consumption of natural resources on the Earth, \nmonitor the risks arising from this, and control the restoration of resources in the interests \nof human life, regulating legislation in this area of various countries and coordinating their \nwork. States and people should be presented with a scientifically based concept of \nresponsible consumption with its own scientific apparatus, that is, the concept of a \nreasonable attitude to natural resources. Unfortunately, the current situation of political \nconfrontation, primarily between the United States and its partners concerning Russia and \nChina, makes it difficult for states to cooperate in implementing the areas of work we have \noutlined in the use of natural resources, as well as in the import substitution of scarce \nminerals and strategic mineral raw materials. For example, the Audit Chamber of the \nRussian Federation reported a decrease in the reproduction of scarce and strategic resources \nfrom 2018 to 2020 by almost two times – from 63% to 32%. According to the \nrepresentatives of the Audit Chamber of the Russian Federation, the management of the \nstate subsoil fund "is not carried out effectively enough", and "the absence of a set of \nmeasures for import substitution of scarce types of minerals and strategic mineral raw \nmaterials creates risks for the national security of the country". As a result, it is proposed to \n"improve the legislation on rational subsoil use" [24]. At the same time, it is necessary to \navoid speculations by some states on the issue of gaining the advantage of some more \ndeveloped countries over other countries or solving their economic development problems \nby using the natural resources of other countries, as the United States would like to do \n7\nE3S Web of Conferences 291, 02015 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202129102015\nSDGG 2021\n', "today. And here we need to find common interstate approaches to solving the problems of \nusing natural resources and restoring them in the interests of the development of both the \nworld and national economies. It is important to find the necessary balanced solutions for \nthe rational use of natural resources and their effective restoration and to accept them for \nunconditional implementation. It is difficult, but we need to do this now so as not to be late. \n4 Conclusions \nToday, the world has clearly identified the problems of conservation and rational use of \nnatural resources, which need to be solved not by individual countries alone but jointly in \nthe interests of the life of future generations and the prevention of a global environmental \ncatastrophe. The main mechanism for solving the problems outlined in the article can be a \nscientifically calculated and justified concept of responsible consumption, which would \nreceive legislative recognition and support in all countries and would ensure planned and \ncoordinated interstate cooperation in this field. And this requires a constructive inter-state \ndialogue, rather than increasing political and economic confrontation in solving the \nproblems of conservation and rational use of natural resources as a modern factor in the \ndevelopment of both global and regional economies. Thus, it should be noted that the issues \nof rational use of natural resources and their reproduction is a complex and difficult \nproblem. Today they are solved in different countries and in different ways. Not all \ncountries, especially industrially developed ones, are ready and willing to limit themselves \nin the use of natural resources in the interests of the development of the national economy, \nas this will objectively be associated with a decrease in profits from the production and sale \nof products and additional costs for measures to reproduce natural resources. We have no \nright to be late and make the process of depletion of natural resources irreversible, calling \ninto question the survival of not only individual countries but also of all mankind. And now \nthe time has come when it is necessary to update not only the conversations on this topic at \nvarious forums and congresses but also to move on to the implementation of specific \nmeasures in the practical plane of solving the problems identified in the article. \nReferences \n1.
