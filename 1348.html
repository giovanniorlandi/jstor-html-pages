        <pre>["merica International \nby Arbitration\nBy Joseph  Conrad F eh r\nAssociate Counsel for the United Stages before the Mixed Claims Cominis- \nsion, now in session at Washington\nTHE United States is now taking \nsteps to bring about the settle\xad\nment of countless international \nclaims and differences through the in\xad\nstitution o f the most momentous arbi\xad\ntration proceedings ever entered into \nbetween nations; these negotiations, the \nsignificance of which has not yet been \nfully appreciated, constitute the substi\xad\ntution o f litigation for force; working, \nthrough judiciary tribunals, toward the \nsettlement of differences that have hith\xad\nerto given cause for war, they offer a \nconcrete basis for the ultimate establish\xad\nment of universal peace.\nThe American program provides for \nthe immediate organization of two \nclaims commissions between the United \nStates and Mexico, pursuant to the Gen\xad\neral Claims Convention and the Special \nClaims Convention which the two coun\xad\ntries agreed upon last Fall and ratified \nearly this year.\nRecognition of Mexico was delayed \nfor many years because both the Wilson \nand Harding Administrations under\xad\nstood the importance of the step from \nthe standpoint of international law. \nRecognition o f the present regime in \nMexico was extended only after the \nObregon Government had expressed its \nwillingness to assume responsibility for \nthe losses and damages inflicted upon \nAmerican citizens by the respective de \nfacto and de j'ure Governments pre\xad\nviously in power. Negotiations leading \nto the signing o f the two conventions \nwere conducted on behalf of the United \nSlates under the direction of Secretary \nHughes, by Charles Beecher Warren, \nformer Ambassador of the United \nStates to Japan, and John Barton Payne, \nformer Secretary of the Interior, the \nAmerican representatives on the American-Mexican\nCommission which met in \nMexico City on May 14, 1923, and com\xad\npleted its work on Aug. 15, 1923.\nThe terms of the conventions creating \nthe two claims commissions, empowered \nthem to determine judicially the obliga\xad\ntions of each nation toward the other \nand its respective nationals, for acts re\xad\nsulting in loss, or damage to person or \nproperty. When Messrs. Warren and \nPayne opened negotiations in Mexico \nCity in the Summer of 1923, they made \nit clear that recognition of the Obregon \nGovernment by the United States was \nconditional upon a manifestation of \ngood faith by Mexico in making a sat\xad\nisfactory adjustment of all American \nclaims. Repudiation o f the confisca\xad\ntory application o f certain provisions of \nthe Mexican Constitution of 1917 was \ninsisted upon as a preliminary to the \nproceedings.\nSecretary Hughes in a communication \nto the Senate on Jan. 14, 1924, declared \nthe main questions relative to American \nclaims against Mexico to be: (1) The\nrestoration or proper reparation for the \ntaking of lands owned by American \ncitizens prior to May 1, 1917; (2) The \nobtaining of satisfactory assurances \nagainst confiscation of the subsoil inter\xad\nests in lands owned by American citi\xad\nzens prior to May 1, 1917; (3) the \nmaking of appropriate claims con\xad\nventions.\nComplying with the demands of the \npeople, the Government of Mexico, in \n1917, readjusted large land holdings \nand organized them into towns or vil\xad\nlages, called “ ejidos,”  without in any \nway indemnifying or compensating the \nprivate owners. This amazing action, \ninvalidating titles to property rights \nwhich had been legally acquired by\n430\n", 'June, 1924 AMERICA VITALIZING INTERNATIONAL LAW 431\nAmerican citizens, caused much hard\xad\nship and injury to American property \nowners in Mexico and elicited a protest \nfrom the United Stales Government, \nwhich insisted that Mexico make just \ncompensation to the owners in accord\xad\nance with the accepted practice of en\xad\nlightened Governments in expropriation \nproceedings. Mexico offered to make \nsatisfactory amends, and on the strength \nof her assurances the present program \nof judicial arbitration was drafted.\nSecretary Hughes thus defines the \ndifferent functions and purposes of the \ntwo commissions:\nThe General Claims Commission has \njurisdiction over all claims of the citi\xad\nzens of either country axu.in.sl the other \nfor losses or damages suffered by persons \nor by their properties, whether such citi\xad\nzens are corporations, companies, associa\xad\ntions, partnerships or individuals, as well \nas over claims by citizens of either coun\xad\ntry growing out of losses or damages suf\xad\nfered by any corporation, company, as\xad\nsociation or partnership in which such \ncitizens have or have had an interest, pro\xad\nvided an allotment to the claimant of his \nproportion of the loss or damage is pre\xad\nsented to the commission, and all claims \nfor losses or damages originating from \nacts of officials or others acting for either \nGovernment and resulting in injus\xadtice. * * *\nThe Special Claims Commission created \nby this convention is charged with ex\xad\namining and deciding all claims which re\xad\nsulted from any act by the following Mex\xad\nican forces:\n1. By forces of a Government de jure or \nde facto :\n2. By revolutionary forces as a result of \nthe triumph of whose cause Governments \ndo facto and de jure have been estab\xad\nlished, or by revolutionary forces opposed \nto them:\n3. By forces arising from the disjunc\xad\ntion of the forces mentioned in Clause 2 \nup to the time when the Government de \njure established itself as a result of a \nparticular revolution ;\n4. By Federal forces that were dis\xad\nbanded :\n5. By mutinies, or mobs, or insurrection\xad\nary forces other than those r< ferred to \nunder Clauses 2, 3, and 1 above, or by \nbandits, provided in any case it be \nestablished that the appropriate author\xad\nities omitted to take reasonable meas\xad\nures to suppress insurrectionists, mobs, or \nbandits, or treated them with lenity or \nwere in fault in other particulars.\nIn accordance with the plan for \njudicial arbitration, Mexico has ordered \nthe return to American owners of all \nproperty and rights, confiscated or \nwrongfully obtained during the revolu\xad\ntion, and has further promised that, if it \nis established that any property or \nrights o f a citizen of the United States \nhave not been restored, the Government \nwill issue the necessary orders wherever \npossible.\nAmong the thousands of claims re\xad\nsulting from the revolutionary activities \nin Mexico are those of numerous Mor\xad\nmon settlers in the State of Chihauhua. \nThe lands and worldly possessions of \nthis sect were confiscated during the \nvarious uprisings of the past thirteen \nyears, the loss compelling many of the \nvictims to leave the country. The De\xad\npartment of State is now studying these, \nwith other claims against Mexico, as a \npreliminary to negotiations.\nThe United States, in countenancing \nthe establishment of these new judicial \nagencies for internationally sanctioned \narbitral action, is gradually committing \nthe world to the doctrine that all dif\xad\nferences between nations can he settled \namicably and honorably by the sound, \nimpartial judgment of able and learned \njurists qualified to apply established \nprinciples of law and customs to such \nquestions. International law must rest \nupon a scientific structure and must, \nfurther, be imbued with color and com\xad\nplexion, if it is to wield the influence \nwhich for so many centuries has been \nexercised by the common law of Eng\xad\nland. This new prestige and authority \nwhich international law is now demon\xad\nstrating are traceable largely to the ar- \nbitrartient by the United States of claims \nand other disputes between nations. So \ngreat has been the growth of this field \nof law in recent years that it bids fair \nto measure up to all the hopes and ex\xad\npectations of Grotius, Puffendorf, Vattel \nand other publicists, to whom much of \nits early development was due.\nTt can no longer he argued that the \nso-called law of nations is ineffective \nand negligible because nations failed to \nendow it with rules governing interna\xad\ntional conduct. This criticism, lam\xad\nentably enough, has not been wholly \nwithout foundation; international tri\xad\nbunals, sitting in judgment upon con\xad\ntroversies between nations as lately as \nforty years ago, completely failed to \nrecognize their opportunities to build \nup the law of nations and codify its \nfundamental principles and doctrines. \nMost of the early international courts \nand commissions, indeed, left this inter\xad\nesting field much as they found it— a \nmere tradition.\n', '432 THE CURRENT HISTORY MAGAZINE June, 1924\nJurists and publicists who first con\xad\nsidered international affairs from a \njuridical standpoint found the statute \non this subject to he little more than a \nlegal corpse. Unlike Coke, Mansfield \nand Blackstone, who breathed into the \nlifeless marble of the common law the \nvitality o f life and "the air of science,” \nthey left it, with few exceptions, the \ncold statue it had always been. Recog\xad\nnizing this unfortunate failure of na\xad\ntions in the past to accept the responsi\xad\nbility of clothing international law with \nvitality and power so that finally it \nmight outgrow its own impotency, the \nUnited States is determined to enlist the \ncooperation o f other nations in build\xad\ning for the future an organized system \nof international jurisprudence. It is \nacknowledged, further, that this result \ncan be accomplished only through in\xad\nternational courts which will base their \ndecisions and opinions on sound rules \nand principles, thereby creating a body \nof international law possessed of char\xad\nacter and binding strength.\nThis purpose, so vital to the solution \nthat the United States and other nations \nare striving for, dominated the pro\xad\nceedings o f the so-called Alabama arbi\xad\ntration, the American-Venezuelan arbi\xad\ntration and the recent sessions of the \nBritish-Ameriean Claims Commission \nwhich stand forth as the foremost arbi\xad\ntral bodies in the history of the wmrld. \nThey undoubtedly contributed most of \nthe fundamental precedents underlying \nthe few\' valuable decisions and settled \nrules by which international tribunals \narc willing to be governed today.\nElihu Root, while Secretary of State, \nwas largely instrumental in the organ-; \nization o f the Permanent Court of Arbi\xad\ntration at The Hague. This assembly \nw\'as authorized by the convention creat\xad\ning it to pass upon all international dif\xad\nferences and misunderstandings prop\xad\nerly coming within its jurisdiction. No \nadjudication was to be announced un\xad\nless accompanied by a written opinion \ndefining dearly the reasons upon which \neach decision was based. This consti\xad\ntuted one o f the first steps in the de\xad\nvelopment of an active law of nations \nendowed with the pow\'er of authority \nand supremacy over individual nations. |\nMr. Root and Secretary Hughes have \noften pointed out that, when nations \nagree to refer a dispute or group of \nclaims to a designated or appointed \ntribunal for settlement, the decisions of \nthat court quite properly receive the \nsolemn sanction of the nations con\xad\ncerned, inasmuch as their observance is, \nas Mr. Hughes has remarked, "a point \nof international honor of the highest \nsort.”\n1 2 , 0 0 0  C l a i m s  A g a i n s t  G e r m a n y\nThe United States and Germany, in \nrecognition of this code of integrity, are \nnow engaged upon the amicable settle\xad\nment of the greatest international lawr- \nsuit ever proposed for arbitration. Pres\xad\nident Coolidgc in his message to Con\xad\ngress emphasized the fact that this pro\xad\nceeding involves the disposition of more \nthan 12,000 claims arising out of the \nwar with Germany. These claims, now- \nbeing presented before the Mixed \nClaims Commission, comprising repre\xad\nsentatives of the United States and Ger\xad\nmany, are in nowise arbitrarily settled; \nthe process of adjudication calls for \nwritten decisions upon countless ques\xad\ntions, many of these being without legal \nprecedent, and necessitating the formu\xad\nlation by the commission of definite \nrules and doctrines which are rapidly \nbecoming an essential part of interna\xad\ntional jurisprudence.\nGermany’s obligation to pay for all \nlosses sustained by American nationals \nin the sinking of the steamship Lusitania \non May 7, 1915, was one of the ques\xad\ntions decided by\' the commission; more \nthan 3,000 claims, totaling $360,000,- \n(iOO, for reimbursement of excess war \nrisk insurance premiums paid on Amer\xad\nican shipping during the war, were sum\xad\nmarily dismissed by the commission, \nwhich found these were not “ susceptible \nof being measured with a reasonable ex\xad\nactness by pecuniary standards”  nor at\xad\ntributable "to Germany’s act as the \nproximate cause” , as defined by the \nTreaty of Berlin.\nJudge Edwin B. Parker of Texas and \nNew York, who was Chairman of the \nUnited States Liquidation Commission \nin Paris after the war. presides over the \ncommission, which is now\' sitting at\n', "June, 1924 AMERICA VITALIZING INTERNATIONAL LAW 433\nWashington. The American Commis\xad\nsioner is Chandler P. Anderson, who \nhas frequently participated in in\xad\nternational arbitral proceedings to \nwhich the United States has been a \nparty. Dr. Wilhelm Kiesselbach of \nHamburg, a renowned specialist in in\xad\nternational law, is the German Com\xad\nmissioner. The United States is repre\xad\nsented before the commission by Robert \nW. Bonynge of New York, former Con\xad\ngressman from Colorado and previously \na member of the United States Monetary \nCommission, who, as agent and chief \ncounsel, is assisted by a staff of asso\xad\nciate counsel. Karl von Lewinski, one \nof Germany’s experts on the Treaty of \nVersailles, is the German agent and , \nchief counsel. These distinguished \njurists and lawyers are charged with the \nresponsibility of deciding the merits of \nthe numerous classes of claims bearing \nupon the Treaty of Berlin o f Aug. 25,\n1921. which incorporates, by reference, \nthe main provisions of the Treaty of \nVersailles.\nDespite the fact that the United States \ndid not elect to become a party to the \nVersailles Treaty and to present its \nclaims before the reparations body, the \nMixed Claims Commission has been \ngranted authority to perform, so far as \nthe United States is concerned, the \nduties and functions of the Reparation \nCommission. The commission’s deter\xad\nmination o f the claims by means of \ndefinitive decisions and opinions inter\xad\npreting the very clauses and sections of \nthe Treaty of Versailles which constitute \nan issue between Germany and tbe for\xad\nmer allied Governments, has been \nwatched with close attention by repara\xad\ntions experts in Europe, with the result \nthat the proceedings before the Mixed \nClaims Commission are proving pro\xad\nfoundly influential in helping Europe \nsolve her post-war problems by similar \nmethods.\nAlthough the United Slates and other \nnations sympathetic to the arbitration \nmethod are thus earnestly seeking to \nestablish a definite plan of cooperation \nintended to build up a body of public' \nlaw having supreme authority over all | \ninternationally justiciable matters, there : \nare still some nations which contend\nthat Governments yield certain qualities \nof sovereignty or national independence \nin subscribing to such a program- \nSoviet Russia, at present the chief expo\xad\nnent of this view, maintains a policy of \nutter isolation and apparent contempt \nfor the rest of the world. This attitude \npresents a problem of far-reaching ef\xad\nfect upon the painstaking efforts now \nbeing put forth to vitalize international \npublic law. For that reason the United \nStates has not seriously considered Rus\xad\nsia’s proposals for the reopening of \ntrade relations, which would lead to the \nrecognition of the Soviet Government \nand place Russia again in the family of \nnations. Secretary Hughes, in compli- \nance with a resolution adopted in the \nSenate, has furnished the Senate Com\xad\nmittee on Foreign Relations with all tbe \ninformation and data acquired by the \nDepartment of State explaining this \nGovernment's attitude toward Russia; \nthe resolution ordered a subcommittee, \nheaded by Senator William E. Borah, to \nmake an investigation o f the situation. \nThe inquiry disclosed the astounding \n. fact that the United States and her na\xad\ntionals have claims against Russia \namounting to nearly $800,000,000. \nAmerican claims relating to property \nconfiscated by the Soviet Government \nare estimated at about $400,000,000, \nand there are additional items of 8241,- \n903,072. representing the debt con- \n1 traded by the Kerensky regime with the \nUnited States Government, and the 875.- \n000,000 bond issue which was floated in \nAmerica by the Kerensky Government \njust before its fall. These debts, aggre\xad\ngating $316,903,072, have been spe\xad\ncifically repudiated by the Soviet au\xad\nthorities in an official decree denying \nliability for any foreign loans con\xad\ntracted either by the Czarist or Kerensky \nGovernments.\nPresident Coolidge, in his message to \nCongress, pointed out that Russia has \nindicated no ‘ 'disposition to compensate \nour citizens who are despoiled” ; and. \nunless the successors to Lenin show \ntheir good faith by making adequate \ncompensation and restitution on all \n| sound claims held by the United States \n| and her nationals, this Government will \nj insist, and properly, that recognition of \nRussia is beyond discussion at this lime.\n"]</pre>
