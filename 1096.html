Her advice to the girl, of today is “uphold the best stand, ards of 1921 young womanhood if, you would be popular.” While she, docs not give her unqualified ap, proval to the “flapper,” this eminent, woman author includes this much, abused young girl in her general, designation of the modern girl., “The girl of today deserves the, center of the stage from the stand, point of both progress and human, interest.” said Miss Crothers. “She, is so honest, so sensible, so sane,, and she understands what you are, talking about. Bite has valuable, opinions of her own on important, subjects. If she does not understand, you can explain, and she will grasp, your meaning with certainty and, spend., ‘‘There were so many things the, old-fashioned girl did not dare fath, om. Nicety forbade her being hn, man. She missed that beautiful free, dom of living and of expression—the, characteristc charm of the girl of, today. There is nothing quite as, magnetic as naturalness in a girl., “Nine times out of ten the natural, young girl is abundantly popular. The, tenth time happens to be a misfit,, in which the unhappy possessor of, a splendd courage of self-expression, is handicapped by wrong instinct., Propensity for doing and saying the, ■wrong thing in an obvious way is, an inheritance with some of us., “There are happier birthrights,, however. For example, that strange, intangible, yet very real something, which \'we call personal magnetism is, positively innate. We either have it, or we do not. It can never be ac, quired in the seed, though possession, of the seed of it admits of propaga, tion. We can become more magnetic, by exercising and developing our, gift., “The od-fashioned girl had this, birthright of magnetism. There was, the most popular girl in the crowd, in hoop skirt days as there is in, i short-skirt days. There was always, the toast of the town—the belle of, the hall., "The difference is old-fashioned, girls were compelled, by constricting, bonds of convention, to suppress, their effervescence, to subdue their, originality and personality. They, were popular as playmates, as sweet, hearts, as wives., TODAY’S GIRL DIFFERENT, “The miss of today Is all of these, and more—she is a companion. She, may not show’ all the conventional, deference once the prerogative of, age, but she give Immeasurably, more—camaraderie, the contagion of, youth. Instead of shutting her elders, out from the magic circle of her, rainbow world she accepts them as, a part of It. Her mother is her big, sister. Her father Is her escort,, sharing her fun and frolic.”, The lady who came into the, spotlight of public favor via Bloom, lngton. 111., chatted a moment of the, Big Sticks—advantages of the small, town as a background to breadth ol, understanding and analysis. Then,, quite suddenly, she returned to her, girl subject., "Just think,” she enthused, "of the, material with which the modern miss, can work. She may have all the, sweetness of her old-fashioned sister,, but with the addition of the freedom, of thinking, acting and being herself., She begins where the other stood, half way along life’s journey., "To those addicted to pasts Miss, Modern Maid may appear a bit crass, at times.

We need girls of sta, bility, and it is my experience that, girls who are style extremists do not, possess that quality. Girls with, bobbed hair are usually told it would, I look\' better under a net and not to, present the appearance of a Fiji, Islander.”, Miss Sarah M.

Va.. and Arcadia, school, tile two great airship schools, of the army air service, a number of, cities are planning to use aerial pho, tographic maps in connection with, city planning, traffic control, street, widening and fire protection work,, according to army officers., Other uses to which photographic, maps are being put are preliminary, Investigations of watersheds, hydro, electric developments- highway, rail, road and canal location, forest sur, veys and various engineering works., Army air officers have perfected, automatic timing of exposures to, .cover the proper ground area and at, the same time secure the neces, sary overlap for the accurate fitting, . together of individual negatives., ,Th1s permits taking of pictures from, i »he moving airship or airplane,, j Lppses have beep discovered espe, cially adapted for this type of work,, j nod the officers have developed the, 1 technioue covering such details as, i the best height from which to take, I pictures for snecific purposes, speed, j of airplane and maintenance of level, I flight to insure verticality of view., , The mays now produced by air ser, I vtce photographers, according to of, ficers. attain a high degree of ac, j curacy and wealth of valuable detail,, j Aerial photography is among the, snhiects taught at the Ross Field, school. Air service officers point, out, that among points of particular, value to engineering to be found in, serial photography are the speed, with which such maps may be pro, duced, ability to oover territory in, accessible on foot, comparatively low, - cost and impossibility of omitting, auv feature of the area photographed., The mosaic niap, army officers, say. does hot mean transit, stadia, ni\\d plane-table are in the discard,, but that engineering surveys made, solely by these time-tried instru, ments Will be Out-of-date., . — • ■■_, WEALTHY SPANIARDS, DONATE AEROPLANE, MANILA, Jan. 5.—Spaniards resid, ing in the Philippines have cabled En, rique Zobel of Manila, who is in Mad, rid, Spain, authorizing him to pur, chase an airplane to deliver it to, the Spanish army operating in Africa., The airplane is to be named “Manila.”, Wealthy Spaniards here have launch, ed a campaign to r=i. e the sum neces, sary to cover the, cost of the fighting, machine.

They are contering their efforts upon, pleas for delay in such an enactment, and in, opposition lo the American valuation system,, which in the present state of foreign exchange, is absolutely essential to any tariff law intend, ed to protect the American producer rather, than to profit the importer., The alien and. domestic, interests which are, fattening at the expense of American produc, tion, are carrying on a well organized and, financed propaganda directed against early, action on the tariff, and against effective, action when it is taken. They are calling at, tention to the fact that as trade conditions are, changing so rapidly, no tariff law enacted now, could be permanent. That is like arguing that, because the water in a stream that is threaten, ing to flood the countryside is fluctuating in its, level, there is no use trying to throw up a dam, of anv height to save houses and lands from, inundation. The fact that it may be necessary, to later revise the schedules of a tariff bill en, acted to meet present conditions, is no good, reason whv needed protective tariff legisla, tion should not be enacted at once., There is involved in this matter not only, the prosperity of the producers of this country, as against the prosperity of a few importers, and financiers, but the matter of keeping faith, with the people who believes.that there already, has been too much delay in tariff legislation., Congress has been in session nine months, and, it will take the most expeditious attention to, bring about the passage of a tariff law before, the present Congress has rolled hound., Hundreds of thousands of wage earners are, idle in this country today because of the im, portation of articles of foreign production, manufactured under labor costs that would, be unthinkable\' in the United States. Failure, to pass a protective tariff law has had far, more to do with the creation and continuance, of the existing industrial depression than most, men imagine, and unless such legislation is, had before many more months have passed,, not only may we not expect improvement, but, la dark deepening of the existing “hard, times.”, No one expects that Congress is going to, pass a perfect tariff law. The perfect tariff, law is like the perfect tax law, it is the one, every man can frame in his own mind with, out having to consult the interests of anyone, but himself. But it is easily possible to en, act a measure based upon the protective prin, ciple, and later correct such defects as ex, perience may develop., The theory that the deliberations of a tariff, commission may be expected to solve the tariff, problem is one that doctrinaires have been air, ing for forty years without any more tangible, result than that which follows the effort of a, pup to catch up with his own tail. Nor are the, people ready to turn the job of regulating tar, iff schedules over to such a commission. The, people are rather weary of the system of put, ting business constantly at the mercy of soiop, bureaucratic board with only a theoretical, knowledge of business, and with no deter, mined policy of tariff making., What the American people voted for, what, they want, what they demand, is a protective, tariff that will restore and preserve prosperity, as we have always enjoyed under a protective, tariff, in the United States. It is argued that, our first duty, in the matter of a tariff, is to, humanity in general rather than to ourselves,, but what shall it profit the world if we go, broke trying to save it? The scriptures say, that he who does not look after his own house, hold is worse than an infidel, and a nation, which will not protect its own people cannot, reasonably expect to look to them for support, and protection., To levy heavy taxes upon American indus, tiy, and then to expose it to destructive alien, competition armed with the deadly weapon of, a cheapness attained through the sacrifice of, human values, is a good plan for wrecking, American industry., Failure to enact with all promptness pos, sible a genuine protective tariff law,—a pro, tective law that will actually protect,—will be, for the party responsible for that failure to, invite defeat at the hands of the people whose, mandate has thus been disregarded., “WHAT IS MAN THAT THOU ART MIND-j, FUL OF HIM” !, I, —, The city man, when he gets up in the morn-1, ing, turns on the gas, picks the paper off the!, front porch, takes a cold shoNver, eats a cold, storage egg, and a slice of baker’s bread toast,, and marvels anew on the mightiness of man., The city man, at night, leaves the heaped, tombs where men bury their souls in business,, and in his smooth riding machine whirls home,, with arc lights for Ins moon, and the smoke, of a thousand chimneys for his heaven., Man’s works are all about him and he be, comes highly important in his own estimation., Religions and philosophies are not born in, cities; they die there., * •, The fanner stumbles from his bed m the, dark, he splits his wood from the tough side, of a knot, lie draws his water from the depths, of a dug well, and, looking off to the east,, he sees the day mysteriously being born again;, lie- pauses a moment and hears the eternal, hymn tlie birds sing each morning to the new, sun; he watches the flood of life-giving light, slowly wash over the rounded hills, and gild, the mirror surface of the pasture stream., At night, after a day in the field, in the, woods, in the hills, somewhere close to the, beginning and root of things, tin4 countryman, comes home through the dusk, and the moon, in its first quarter swings a silver crescent, over his left shoulder; the afterglow of the de, parted sun touches the tips of the tall trees, away off to the west; the birds are snuggling, to their night’s rest with contented twitter, and chirp; the night hawk whirls his great, circles between the circling bats, and the wliis-j, per of little winds in the forest tell of many, mysteries., After supper the stars come out, blazing, eternal stars, vivid red Mars, the constella, tions gem the purple vastness above, and the, cooling earth invites to rest., And the farmer understands how the an, cienl felt Avhen he exclaimed: “What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?”, ---f, THINGS WEfTHINK, THINGS OTHERS THINK AND WHAT WE THINK, OF THE THINGS OTHERS THINK, _I, A baby and an automobile are both expensive but, they are equally unavoidable if the family insists, upon them., • • •, Just living doesn’t mean much. A dead whale is, more valuable than a life goldfish., • * •, Nearly anybody forgets a favor but hardly anybody, forgets a wrong., • * *, The truth is, flappers, that many a man not yet, too far gone in years to be worthy of your attentions if, he would receive them, is glad that he married the girl, of his day rather than one of the present—but he is too, polite to admit it., • • •, If you must have spies in your business, you’d better, get out of business., • • •, Many a man who fumes and swears if he has to wait, five minutes for his wife to get ready for\' the theater,, will coax and pet his balky automobile for an hour when, it refuses to start, without getting out of patience., • • •, , The girl who refuses to go to the dance because she, | has "nothing to wear,” is foolish.

Jan. 5.—For every, active, high-strung young American,, running his affairs at top speed of, efficiency, there is the danger of let, ting drugs offer a “rest,” the tempta, tion to try a little “suspended anima, tion” rather than a normal vacation,, ; or to substitute false stimulus for, real vigor., And then there are the wretched, addicts steeped in the hopes and de, spairs and deceiving vapors that, j curl up from the poppies of the, East., For here In our United States is re, produced that which was the China of, fifteen years ago., Here in our midst is the China, that was the world\'s greatest opium, consumer.

Statistics show, that would mean fifty grains for, every man, woman and child in the, country., “As regards opium using, we are, using the same amount China did, fifteen years ago when she was the, chief opium consumer of the world., The United States now has that, doubtful distinction., “We got very much excited over, the whiskey habit. We have amend, ed the Constitution as a measure, against it. But without entering into, any discussion of prohibition, I want, to say that, in my mind, the opium, evil is infinitely more harmful than, the whiskey habit ever was., "When a drinker is deprived of his, whiskey he becomes a limp dish, rag. He suffers as an individual., “Whiskey being a stimulant, this, reaction comes when the storm sub, sides., “But when the opium user comes, out from the influence of this drug,, which is a sedative and holds the, nervous system and the organs of, the body in check, he is excited and, greatly stimulated.,, “Now, while any normal man may, want to kill his mother-in-law—, yes, I’ve got one and she doesn’t, mind these remarks of mine—the, opium user without his fumes will, kill any one. Society at large will, suffer from him., “If the United States and Canada, would join in identical procedure in, regulating the opium traffic we, would have no further worry than to, watch the smuggling in from for, eign parts, and you can he sure that, Dr. Carleton Simon will attend to, that very thoroughly., “The problem must be dealt with, nationally and in conjunction w\'ith, Canada—unless we do that we might, as well throw up our hands and, quit., “The way to cure the habit is to, have no drugs available. Tf there, is no opium there can be no habit., Until then we cannot wipe out the, habit.”, CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING, FOR RENT—APARTMENTS IN THE, Burkhart Flats.

A, specialist here said flying is hardly, safe enough at this time to make, it suitable as a cure for patients, for patients whose particular dis, ability is due to nervous disorder,, however., "1 frequently prescribe motoring, for nerve patients.” said the doctor,, “but generally short runs of forty, to fifty miles. I do not think peo, ple suffering from ‘nerves’ would, wish to fly at the present time.”, “FLYING HOSPITALS”, The doctor pointed out, however,, that to prescribe flyng for tuber, cular patients and others suffering, from diseases accompanied by mal, nutrition was altogether a different,, matter., He was of the opinion that air, ship hospitals were a practicable, possibility of the near future., Patients would probably be taken, up to a height not exceeding 5 000, \'o 10 00(1 feet at first, and in the j, first case (J^ir a few hours only, a;, period which might, gradually he ex, tended to twenty-four hours., "We have not yet. however," said, the doctor, “very much information, as to what the effect, of resting for a, considerable time at a very high, altitude may be on the human or, ganism., SUNBATHS, “It seems certain, however, that!, sojourn in the germ-free air will, I, hy increasing oxybenation. Improve, and purify the blood, and the mod, ern school of medicine is tending, more and more to recognize a given, disease as a local effect of unsatis, factory blood., "Wonderful things have been done, by a famous Swiss doctor with what, is known as helio-therapy—cure by, sunlight.

A sudden and, violent wind storm, which sprang, «np early in the morning, tore off 50, feet of the iron roof of the federal, courthouse building, whirled it over, the\'telegraph wires and deposited it, ilMb jtwisted mass on Second avenue,, at the rear of tlie Model cafe, more, than half a block from the point of, starting. The wind howled and made, things lively for about an hour. Be, sides the damage done to the roof, of the courthouse, the gale tore off, the anchoring wires of the new tele, phone lines at the corner of Fourth, avenue, and was responsible for sev, eral minor accidents and damage, around town., Tinner Wilbur is busy making tem, porary repairs to the courthouse roof., He is filling the gap with roofing, paper as a temporary measure, as a, snowstorm threatens. The torn off, portion of the roof has been pre, sented to Roy Shafer on condition, that he remove it forthwith, thereby, restoring traffic on Second avenue,, and he is now busy taking the iron, -apart and carting it away. Pinkis is, helping him move the stuff., The funeral of hte late W. W., Pendergraft was held on Sunday, afternoon from Eagle hall. The serv, ices were under the auspices of the, Pioneers of Alaska., Linemen of the T. &. T. depart, ment of the N. C.

On picking up, the object he discovered that was a, 50-cent bingle. Further investigation, brought to light other bingles and, when he had concluded his search,, he had $1.75 worth of these ad, juncts of trade. Thompson advances, the theory that the bingles were, blown from some one’s pocket by the, wind., Erin Van Curler, who is engaged, in mining in the Big Chena dountry,, was a recent visitor in town on his, annual pilgrimage for the purpose, of replenishing his stock of supplies., He was not accompanied by Mrs., Van Curler, as customary in former, years, as she was unable to leave, at the time. She will make a trip, to town later on., Mrs. Bob Morris was an outgoing, passenger on the last Chatanika train,, en route to her home at Bridge 5,, after a brief visit in the city., The pupil sof the Fairbanks school, have begun “silent reading” to par, tially replace the “oral reading", which has been emphasized to this, time. Experimental results in the, last few years have brought about a, radical shift in emphasis upon the, aim to be accomplished in reading., Oral reading aims especially at cor, rect pronunciation of words. Silent, reading aims primarily at thought, getting or understanding what is, material read silently is better un, derstood than material read orally., coblenTtaking, ON AMERICAN, ASPECT, COBLENZ, Jan. S.—Little by little,, Coblenz has been taking on an, American aspect, with a will an 1 a, smile in some respects, but reluc, tantly and with a frown so far as, most of the German population is, concerned. The recent formalities of, peace apparently did not make a, particle of difference either way., Some of tlie bitterness the Germans, showed when the American army, marched into Coblenze December 8,, nearly three years ago. has subsided., Coblenz now is one of tlie liveliest, little cities of central, western Eu, rope. Not for the Americans alone,, nor the English, French and Bel, gians but for the Germans, too, and, the blinds in the German homes,, which were drawn in resentment at, the coming of the Americans, have, all been raised, regardless of wheth, er the occupants like or disapprove, of the occupation forces, and busi, ness has thrived to such an extent, that many a Coblenz merchant has, put aside a snug little fortune, as, fortunes go in Germany., American civilians have been pour, ing into the occupied area for the, past two years and a half, thousands, for sightseeing purposes and others, pn business missions which have, kept them here. Then various of, ficers and enlisted men have left, the army from time to time to enter, business of some kind, and gradual, ly the American colony on the Rhine, has grown until today it is estimated, there are something like 2,000 civ, ilians from the United States scat, tered about the Coblenze area., There are “American stores” all, about town but all of them are not, owned by Americans. American-made, goods are on sale at half the down, town shops, and “English spoken, here” greets shoppers in all the prin, cipal streets. At the news stands, about town the Amaroc News, which, is the daily newspaper of the Ameri, can Forces in Germany, Is on sale, as well as daily newspapers from, New York and Chicago., In the streets, during the shopping, hours, nearly as much English as, German is heard. An American feels, quite at home in Coblenz half an, hour after he arrives. j, More Money For, Mexican Schools, MEXICO CITY. Jan.. 5.—Less will, be spent by the Mexican government, in 1922 for the army and more for, schools than ever before. The army, budget for 1922 calls for $124,383,8 ">9,, or more than $30,000,000 less than the, 1921 budget. The estimate is based, on a standing army of 50,000 men, to, which strength the various units are, now being rapidly reduced., The 1922 budget includes an appro, priation of $1,090,000 for the develop, ment of aviation „, The appropriation for schools is, $50,000,000. ’, JVJOVIFS, A treat is in store tonight for the, patrons of the Empress theater. An, nette Kellerman, the most noted wo, man swimmer of the day, also said, to possess the most beautiful figure, on earth, is featured in her famous, comedy-drama, “What Women Love.”, The star is at her best in this pro, duction and gives a number of, underwater exhibitions that are noth, ing short of marvelous., The picture is a rare combination, of breath-catching drama and de, lightful humor, being especially suit, able to Miss Kellerman, inasmuch as, it provides a wonderful latitude for, the dispay of her physical prowess.), Also the two-reel Educational com, edy "Mr. Fatima.’ You will sure en-j, joy this big special “double header”, comedy program., CARTOONIST TO, BE HONORED BY, OREGON NS, SALEM, Ore., Jan. 5.—Oregon resi, dents are raising funds for the erec, tion of a monument over the grave of, Homer Davenport, noted cartoonist,, who was buried at his\'* birthplace,, Silverton, Ore., near here, nine years, ago at the age of forty-three years., Davenport was raised at Silverton,, knew everyone for miles around and, went from that little town to San, Francisco where his work first, gained fame., Old timers of Silverton still talk, of Homer Davenport as a boy. He, had ear marks of genius from the, start, they say., Most of the hoy\'s time in school, was spent in drawing pictures of the, teacher. \'No matter how valuable a, hook was, Davenport usually found, ample room on the fly leaf for a, picture. These hooks are cherished, belongings today., No one had taken Davenport’s, drawings seriously until a cousin of, his cable from Chicago and while, lie sat visiting, the boy drew his pic, ture. Tlie cousin was delighted and, prevailed upon the elder Davenport,, who had always expressed more faith, in Home than anyone else, to send, his son to an art school in San, Francisco. Soon young. Homer was, on the staff of a San Francisco, daily and it was hut another step, to New York., Davenport never forgot Oregon or, Silverton. One time, it is said, he, was sent to interview Gladstone,, England\'s great statesman. After, getting by a cordon of guards, Dav, enport found Gladstone in his gar, dens. The statesman asked Daven, port his name and where he was, from., “Silverton, Oregon,” was the reply., Gladstone got a map, looked up, Silverton and them made his visitor, welcome, later inviting him to call, again., California Citrus, Crop Is Large One, LOS ANGELES, Jan. ii.—The Amer, ican public consumed 22,000,000 boxes, of California oranges and 4,718,800, boxes of California lemons during the, last twelve months, according to the, annual report of G. Harold Powell,, general manager of the California, Fruit Growers\' Exchange., California’s citrus crop, thei report, said, was the largest in history. Co, operative marketing was given credit, by Powell as being responsible for, moving the crop “in the face of con, ditions that proved disastrous to the, sale of practically all staple agricul, tural crops.”, Farm Land Found, To Contain Gold, GRASS VALLEY, Calif., Jan. 5.—, Gold bearing ore is being shipped, from a field near here which has been, under cultivation for about 60 years., The ore is said to run several hun, dred dollars to the ton., Recently a wandering prospector, discovered a ledge a short distance, below the surface of the field and, explorations disclosed the ore.

As long as steam, con escape there is not any danger, of an explosion but if the steam is, confined and cannot escape, • the, pressure gradually increases until, finally the boiler blows up, just as, the top of the mountain blows off if, gas and steam inside is confined., There is a great deal of steam and, gas coming from the crack in the, mountain. Dittmar reported. Before, the big eruption of 1915 there was, very little steam emitted., Several geysers have made their, appearance since the eruption in, what is known as the Devil’s Kitchen,, one of the noted spots in the, park. In the Devils Kitchen there, are between 700 and 800 active, hot, springs, boiling mud craters and, geysers within an area of twenty, five acres.
