The Alexandria police, arrested the parties and they, were tried in \'.he Corporation Court, of this city., A white man was arrested in this, \' \', city recently on a felony charge, al ged, to have been-- committed a short, distance from this city.

When the fain- A, ilv lived in Accomae county, V\'u, the :hl, . .Ut, father, while in his barn, droppe tr, dead. 0, Several years later a brother, Tho- | ^, mas Satehell, died sudr\'enly while | ridoing, some work about the house. On, , ila, the following day, while the body of .u, Thomas was stil! lying in the little ^, parlor, John Satehell, another brother, ^, died suddenly while doing some work, about the barn. 18, The mother and daughter, lets alone *u, in the world, sold out their small, farm and came to Baltimore to live. tsl, For the past six or seven weeks Mrs. /, Satehell had on numerous occasion:- ir., in her dreams saw her daughter Mil- :, lie, garbed in white robes. Ofl\'imcs j ii?, large blood stains appeared on the j />i, robes. I ?, Many times during the- ni-ht th . n;, I mother horrified, would rise up in bed j 1, to see that nothing- had happened tO H, her daughter. Then she would dro:? fi, off to sleep again, trying to forget the, dreams, but in vain. Each lime they ^, reappeared, and the same white clad, figure of her daughter made its ap" <, pearance to her. She also had promo- ^, nitions during the day. ^, Another strange feature of tiiC, death yesterday is that six vcars ago i T,, , - i, Mrs. Satchell had decided to marry ;., q, a John Willis, of Accomac county, ,f, Va., a childhood friend. Willis, it, it said, came from his home in Virginia, to this city and began making ~, all the plar.s for the wedding.
