N.\nSee, the well known Mefilodist min\nister, is now selling stock in the In\nvention which he patented a short\ntime ago and which railroad men\nsay, will revolutionize things in rail\nroad circles.\nRev. Mr. See\'s invention consists\nof a tender for a railroad engine so\ndevised that when going at a great\nrate of speed it will take on coal and\nwater. No stops are necessary, and\nthie Is the saving of time which rail\nroads have long sought after.\nBy an ingenious arrangement as\nthe train pulls near to the place\nwhere a car of water and a car of\ncoal are standing on trestles beside\nthe railroad the car nf water and\ncoal, both cars much smaller than\nthe tender itself, which are already\nin the tender, are shoved outwards\nand they meet squarely on the rails\non the trestle. Th«y elide »long it\nand stop and the^tender M it goes\nalong picks up the other two cars\nwhich have been filled and goes on\nwith them. Thus It has a full supply\nof water and coal and no stops. By\nthe same arrangement a device to\ntake on passengers can be had.\nAnother patent is a sliding floor\nwhich is worked by the fireman and\ndoes away with shoveling. When\ncoal is needed, open goes the furnace\ndoor, the coal on the slide floor is\nshot into the furnace, just as much\nas is needed, and the door Is closed\nagain.\nDirectors and Officers Elected.\nAt the annual meeting of the\nstockholders of the Mexicana Gold\nMining company, held In Waxahach\nie on December 1st, the following di\nrectors were elected for the ensuing\nyear: D.

West, junior member\nof the law firm of West, Chapanurs^\nWest, and a prominent member of\nthe Texas National Guard, died at 3\no\'clock yesterday afternoon from in\njuries due to a fall of fifty feet down\nthe elevator shaft in the Wheat\nbuilding at 10 o\'clock that morning.\nThe accident occurred without\nwarning and there were no eye-wit\nnesses. The law office of the firm is\non the third floor of the building\nand the elevator had just passed up\nward and was at the seventh floor.\nIt is supposed that the door at the\nthird floor landing had been left\nopen and Major West walked into\nthe orifice expecting to step on the\nfloor of the elevator. He stepped\ninto space and fell to the basement,\nthree floors below, his body making\nseveral revolutions before it reach\ned the bottom. Numbers of persons\nwho were waiting for the elevator\non the ground floor or street en\ntrance saw the body of Major West\npass on its way downward.\nTom C. Beulow, who conducts the\ncigar stand at the entrance of the\nbuilding, was also a witness just be\nfore the fall terminated. As he fell\nMajor West uttered loud cries tor\nassistance. These were heard by\nmany occupants of the building, who\nrimhert like the coti-UoK. The Injur\ned man\'s brothers, Capt. Tom West\nand Dr. W. B. West, who were in\nhis office, also hurried to the spot.\nMajor West in falling struck his\nshoulders and head on the concrete\nflooring at the bottom of the eleva\ntor shaft. The formation at the bot\ntom prevented him from falling full\nforce upon his head, and his shoul\nders sustained the greatest shock of\nthe fall. This probably prevented In\nstant death. He was bleeding and un\nconscious when picked up. but JULved\nAve hours. Several physicians In the\nbuilding and dozens of citizene vol\nunteered assistance. The body was\nI removed and placed on the floor of\n[the basement, where first surgical at\ntention was administered.

Yoakum is free Ιο ad\nmit that mistakes have been made\nby the railroads, and that some of\nthe troubles of today are the out\ncome of pitch mistakes, according\nto Harper\'s Weekly, lie also believes\nthat the solution of the railway\nproblem is to be found not in the\nantagonism of the people toward the\nroads, but in the co-operation of the\npeople and the railways through the\nfederal government. The time has\ngone by when a railroad could go\nahead and perfect its plans and car\nry them out without consulting the\npeople through whose territory it\nran, he adds, and the business of en\nlightening railway managers and of\nenlightened legislators is to correct\npast mistakes, to make a repetition\nimpossible, and to arrive at a work- |\ning basis where the road and the !\ncommunity can best serve each oth\ner with justice to both. In an address\nbefore the St I-ouis Traffic club, Mr.\nYoakum remarked that never in the\nhistory of our country lias there\nbeen a time when the masses of the\npeople so well understand the rela\ntion of the railroads to the public as\nat present, or so well realized the\ndifficulties and hardships to which\nι ne roans arc sunjecieu.\n"All of the states and territories\nof tlie union, barring the New Eng\nlanil states," tie adde.i, "need more\nrailroads. The si ate of Missouri re-(\nquires more railroads to hasten its:\nadvancement The new state of Ok- J\nlahoma lias only one-half its terrlto\nr> supplie! The state of Arkansas\nhas been slow in the construction of\nrailroads, and therefore backward in\nthe development of its rich, undevel- j\noped iv> jurées, w hile Texas needs,\nnul iic t ! s In 11 y 1(1,000 miles of new\nroad to encourage its proper expan\nsion Take as a dividing line the Mis\nsissippi river, with its splendid\niouimi r 11 clii. s, extending from\nSt. 1\'aul to Now Orleans; the vast\nterritory lyin.- west of the river\ncompri. » ιϋ\' per < eut of the area of\nthe I\'niti I States not including\nAlaska, while of our 2,\'ÎO.OOO miles\nof railroad about 120,000 miles are\nlotau 1 to the east of the river and\n105,000 mill s to the west In other\nwords. ΙΓ> il» r cent of the total mil\neage of the country is serving 6»\nper cent of the total area."\nIn other words, Mr. Yoakum fav\nors national regulation, but is oppos\ned to state regulation. In tin· Virgin\nia case, decided yesterday, the su\nρ re me court of the i\'nlted States\ngave the railroads a slight jolt. The\nVirginia legislature enacted a two\ncent passenger rate and the railroad\ncommission of that state made an\norder putting in force the new rate.\nThe United States circuit court of\nappeal» held that the law was un\nconstitutional and an appeal waa\n(aken to \'he luireme court of the\nUnited Sta\'ei. That tribunal revera\ned the finding of the lower court.\nPerhaps Mr. \\rtkr.m is right. Per\nhaps It wotil \' be advisable for rail\nroad managers, law makers and the\nj people to get together.\nAS THK SOUTH SKKS IT.\nI The decision of the supreme court\nsettles for all times the question of\nthe legislature\'s authority to prohi\nbit the education of the white and\nnegro races at the same institution.\nThe Kentucky legislature, aiming\nthe law at Berea college, has already\n; foi bidden their joint education, and\nnow that the highest court has up\nheld its right so to do only the re\npeal of the prohibitory law by the\nsame branch of the government\nwhich enacted it can make lawful\nthe college\'s original practice.\nThe question handled by the su\nprem court was. of course, solely\none of law. It was not within the\nprovince of the tribunal to consider\nthe wisdom or the ethics of the pro\nhibitive legislation. The constitution\nal point of authority was all that It\nhad to weigh. The other considera\ntions were for the legislature which\nenacted the law or for the citizens\nback of the legislature. The legis\nlature was guided evidently by what\nit believed to be wisdom. The two\nviewpoints were as far apart as the\npoles.\nThp fnnnripra nf Rereal oollearft\'\nheld that any line of demarcation\nbetween the whites and blacks, so\ncially or otherwise, was wicked;\nthat the recognition of equality was\nnot only sound, but praiseworthy,\nami that a good way to elevate the\nnegro and to bring to pass the level\ning of the two races was by means\nof coeducation. The legislature, on\nthe other hard, took the view that j\nthe intermingling of the two races\nat one college was good for neither;\nthat nature had itself drawn a color\nline which should be respected; that\nracial sentiment in the case of both\nraces was a force which law-making\nbodies should properly take cogniz\nance of; that socially and economi\ncally co-education was bad and that\nparticularly in the south, where the\nnegro was so numerous, it held pos\nsibilities of real evil. Having this\nview, there remained the question\nHum answered by the supreme court:\nι Would a law based on that view be\nj valid?\nThe enactment of the legislature\nI was- supported by a strong local sen\nI timent. It was resisted stoutly by the\nj friends of the idea of co-education\njot the races. The outcome of the liti\njgatlon will be hailed or deplored ac\ncording to the theories of the indiv\nidual on the race question. Undoubt\nedly in the south where the negro\nhas always found his best friends,\nwhere he is best understood and j\nwhere he lives more happily than,\nanywhere else-—the legal victory of j\nthe legislature will be popular. j\nSoutherners, after many years of j\npractical experience, thought and ob- ;\nservation—after many years of co- .\noperation with the negro—have \'\nfound that the separation of the ra- !\nces works the better results in the j\nlong run. The leaders of thought in ]\nthe negro race have reached the j\nsame conclusion. These latter will j\nprobably be found praising the out- \'\ncome of the litigation over Uerea j\ncollege especially since it means, \'\nif the announced plans of the Berea !\ncollege trustees meet with success, \'\nthe early establishment of a college 1\nfor the exclusive use of the mem\nbers of the negro race. -Louisville!\nCourier-Journal\n«JKNKHYL sni:mi».\\\\.\nIt was l\'hll Sheridan who said that\nif he owned Texas and hades, he\nwould rent out the former and go\nlive in the latter Possibly there was j\nprovocation for the remark, for Phil\nwas on the frontier when everything\nsave the climate was uninviting, and\n•-specially so for a federal officer\nwith a bit of test I η ess in his make\nup.

And so they were not in\ndifferent to the unveiling of the\nSheridan monument in Washington\nι he other day: they freely concede\nthat Sheridan did faithful service\n\':>r the union cause and consequent\nly do not begrudge the money spent\nfor a monument to commemorate his ;\ndeeds, lie was tin· Stonewall Jack\nson of the northern army, his blown\nwere fast and furious and effective.!\nWe are told by a biographer that it\nwas Sheridan w ho drove Louis Na-!\npoleou out of Mexico. Sheridan was i\nin command in Texas. The troops of j\nJuarez were without clothing or am- j\nmunition. Sheridan had a large quan- j\ntit y left over from the war, and he\nsent word to Juarez that on a certain\nday, 30,000 uniforms with other\nsupplies would be on a point of the\nRio Urande river In charge of a ser\ngeant and two men. Juarez under\nstood the hint. On the dajr In ques\ntion, he crossed the river, took pos\nsession of the stores and appropriat\ned them. Bazaine was in command\nof the French troops. When he saw\nthe federal uniforms filing on the\nhills, he at once jumped to the con\nclusion that the United etates had\ntaken the part of Juarez, and re\ntreated into Mexico. Louis Napoleon\nwithdrew the French forces and left\nMaximlllian to his fate. By a singu\nlar coincidence, Sheridan was with\nthe German army during the Franco\nFruseian war, and when the Prus\nsians were closing In on Sedan, Sher\nidan was the first one to convey to\nVon Moltke and Bismarck the Intel\nligence that the emperor of the\nFrench was in chief command. Nei\nther of the two great men could be\nlieve It, but on Sheridan\'s insisting\nthat this was the fact, they delayed\ntheir movements and presently a\nbarouche came out of the French\nlines bring Louis Napoleon to the\nconference. Sheridan In his life has\ndescribed with matchless force his\nfeelings as he saw the fallen emper\nor seated upon a bench awaiting the\ndecision of Bismarck and Von\nMoltke and Emperor William. He\nsays In his book: "I thought, \'Aha,\nmy fine fellow, 1 drove you out of\nMexico, and now I am to see the\nlast act in your career.\' "—Waco\nTimes-Herald.\nI\'ECCLIAR COVRT OATHS.\nForm Differs, but the Substance Is\nthe Same.\nIn a certain court the other day\nthere was a most Oriental setting\nto the case on trial. Slant-eyed men,\nwith the ques wound around In a\nthick mat at the back of their heads,\nand in loose, quilted coats and baggy\ntrousers, filled many of the seats re\nserved for spectators, as well as\nthose occupied by plaintiff and de\nfendant. A Chinaman in. European\ndress stood near ίο act as interpret\ner, and a witness was called to the\nbox.\n"Swear the witness in," said the\ncourt clerk, and at a word from the\ninterpreter the Chinaman sank upon\nliis knees and was handed a saucer.\n"You shall tell the truth, the\nwhole truth." droned the interpreter\nin his own language.\nThe witness struck the saucer up\non the brass rail before him and\nthe ehina wr.s cracked into a half\ndozen pieces.\n"If you do not tell the truth your\noui shall be cracked like the saucer,\n(ontinud the official administering\nthe oath, and the ceremony was over.\nAn oath has nothing whatsoever\nto do wiih Christianity, and adher\nents to every sort of religion the\nworld over have their separate ways\nof affirming, or swearing, to the\ntruth. An oat.li is a solemn attes\ntation made under an immediate\n>-ense of responsibility to the Deity\nwhom the one taking the oath be\n\'ieves in. and also the invocation of\ndivine vengeance upon the witness\'\nhead should he speak falsely. Oaths\nhave been used since the earliest\nages, and have always been consider\ned as supplying the strongest hold\non the conscience of man as a pledge\nof future conduct -a guarantee of\nveracity.\nAlthough the forms of oaths dif\nfer. the substance is the same,\nwhich is that tlie Deity is called up\non to witness the truth of what Is\nsaid. A Jew is sworn on the Penta\nteuch, or Old Testament, with his\nhat on, closing with "So help me,\n.Jehovah." The Mohammedan is\nsworn on his sacred book, the Koran;\nthe Gentoo (Hindoo) by touching\nwith his hand the foot of a Brahmin,\nor priest, of his religion, and the\nBrahmin himself is sworn by touch\nIng the hand of another such priest.\nAs shown above, Chinese are some\ntimes sworn η y ιηο ιιγ™κιπκ ui «\nsaucer, but also by what is known as\nJoss-stick burning. This is a cere\nmony r>f burning one of the sticks\nused by their priests in the ceremon\nies before their Joss, or god. This j\nsignifies that their god is called up\non to witness the veracity of wh.^f\nthey say.\nThe Quaker will not take an oath,\nand there are others, because of re- !\nligious scruples, or because of hold- j\ning to no religion Rt all, who re\nfuse to swear to the truth. They at- I\nfirm. Affirmations consist of the rais- \'■\ning of the right hand above the head I\nand. Instead of swearing to the, truth j\nthe witness affirms.\nThe very devout Hebrew, In af- t\nfirming, raises the right band and\nextends the thumb, index and second\nfingers, forming the letter Scheen,\nIndicating the first letter of the word\nSchadle, or God. The devout t\'hrist\nlan of certain sects raises his hand\nin affirmation in the same manner,\nwith the same fingers and thumb\nMended, considering that the gest\nure represents the Holy Trinity.\nThe law recognizes no difference\nbetween the oath and the affirma\ntion in that false testimony given\nunder either condition la counted\nperjurj.
