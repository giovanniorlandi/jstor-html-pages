Last bulletin gave fore\ncasts of disturbance to cross continent 29 to April a, warm wave\n2S to April 1, cool wave 31 to April 4. Next disturbance will\nreach Pacific coast about Aprila, cross west of Rockies country by\nclose of 3, great central valleys 4 to 6, eastern states 7. Warm\nwave will cross west of Rockies about April a, great central val\nleys 4, eastern states 6. Cool wave will cross west of Rockies\nabout 5, great central valleys 7, eastern states 9.\nApril is tiu\'lv a quiet weather month, but it will bring\nfrequent and radical weather changes this year averaging very\ncold east of the Rockies and warmer than usual on the Pacific\nslope.\nSecoud disturbance of April will reach Pacific coast about 6,\ncross west of Rockies country by close of 7, great central valleys\n8 to 10, eastern states it. Warm will cross west of Rockies\ncountry about 6, great central valleys 8, eastern states 9. . Cool\nwave will cross west of Rockies about 9, great central valleys\nit, eastern states 13.\nWhile temperatures will frequently move up and down they\nwill average unusually cool from about r to S with high temper\nature waves not far from March 31 and April 9. From near 10\nto near 1 7 another long, low temperature period will occur.\nNear 22 and 23 a severe northern cold wave may be expected to\ncarry frosts farther south than usual with very cool all over the\neast of Rockies country. These dates are for meridian 90 and\nyou must count a day or two earlier for west of that line and a\nday or two later for east of it. The average temperatures will\nlie high on Pacific slope while they are low east of Rockies and\nthe month will average much colder east than west of the Rocky\nridge.\nKvery storm wave of April will develop unusually great\nintensities in all its weather features. Rainfall will be deficient\nbetween meridian 00 and the Rockies and east of the Allcgha\nnies. Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and about the upr lakes rain,\nfall will I from about to alxve normal. Altogether April will\nbe a cold, backward month cast of the Rockies and bad for all\nkinds of crops, while neatly the reverse will be true for Pacific\nslope.\nmi\nEm\njnj\nTho Family Gofoty Oil\nCie CDeca n HairSCii\ns\nFor Sale by the Following :\nReliable Dealers -\n\'.

D. Hunter, who is in\ncharge of the boll weevil investi\ngation for the department of agri\nculture, predicts that the weevils\nwill be numerous and destructive\nthis year.\nThe estimated population of\nTexas, according to a bulletin is\nsued by the Census Bureau is\n3,536,613. The population in 1890\nwas 3,048,710. The gain for the\nperiod was 406,590, nearly half a\nmillion, or 13.3. per cent. The\nnumber of persons per square mile\nin Texas in 1900 was 12. and now\nit is 13. .The area is square miles,\naccording to the latest calculations,\nis 262,39s of land and 3,499 of\nwater.

Huntsvile Post-Item.\nTHINK THEV WILL OET IT.\nBryan wants a cotton mill-\nBryan asked for information from\nthe same firm that made Caldwell\na proposition, and Bryan has been\ninformed that they have plenty of\ncotton mills to let, and that Bryan\ncan get one at the same price it is\noffered here. That sounds good,\nand the fact that this proposition\nis being made to a number ( of\ntowns, and that several deals have\nalready len closed, shows that\nthe cotton mills are coming to\nTexas on a large scale, and that\nthere is big mill interests behind\nthe firm establishing these mills.\nA dozen mills working together\nand under one management will\nmean that each mill can be made a\nsuccess.\' and many of the expenses\nand troubles of small independent\nmills can be avoided. Cotton mills\nare still being offered pretty freely\nto any town that shows that it\nwants one. and Caldwell havintr\nshown her willingness to do her\npart has good reason to count on\nthe mill now as a certainty. It\ntakes a little time to close up such\nmatters, but this can be closed in a\nshort time, and when the first dirt\nis turned for the new plant there\nwill be an increase in the value of\nevery piece of real estate in the\ntown and county. It just means\nthe beginning of a city, and means\nthat having secured a big cotton\nmill, we will have the nerve to go\nafter some more manufacturing en\nterprises and get tbem and build a\ntown here that will be worth\nwhile, and that will not be solely\ndependent upon the annual rain,\nfall and the production of cotton\nand corn.

To most people the\nquestion seems a foolish one, yet\nthis is a material age when the\nholier, higher sentiments of the\nmind are too often "m edernized\'\nby cold, speculative criticism.\nSentiment is beautiful and some\ntimes we allow its romance and\nbeauty to cultivate ami soften the\nroughened edges of our lives; why\nthen, should we not celebrate the\noccasion of the greatest event in\nthe history of Christian thought,\nand, in fact, the greatest in the\nhistory of the world the resurrec\ntiou of our Lordi Savior? Is\nthere any logical reason why we\nshould not? Surely Christian\nthought cannot affotd to be nar\nrow-minded and prejudiced. We\ncelebrate the occasion, not the day.\nWe celebrate occasions in our\nnational life, why not the greatest\noccasion of onr religion ? The\nsentiment, or whatever you will,\nof Easter has been cherished as the\nmost joyous season of the whole\ncycle of the Church\'s Year for\ncenturies aud yearly refreshes the\nmind and soul with the sweet\nthoughts of the resurrection angel.\n"Christ our Passover is sacrificed\nfor us; therefore let us keep the\nfeast."
