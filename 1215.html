        <pre>['jOj LAST EDITION O\nMAYOR WANTS LID-LIFTERS PENNED\nLITTLER BATTERS MARKHAM I. C. PLAN\nTHE DAY BOOK\nAn Adless Newspaper, Daily Except Sunday\nVOL. 6, NO. 68 Chicago, Saturday, December 16, 1916\n398\nPREACHER AND RICH\nMAN ACCUSED OF\nROBBING DEAD\nm, Rev. Edwin L. Harvey Indicted\' and Banker Farson\n- Named in Strange Case Accusers Pick\' Holes in\nProfessional "Uplift"\nProfessional philanthropy and up\nlift .was hit- another jolt yesterday.\nThis time they were found mixed in\na sordid game. The grand jury yes\nterday indicted a preacher, on the\ncharge of stealing a dead\' man\'s prop\nerty. And the grand jury also named\na millionaire philanthropist, banker\nand broker as being implicated in the\ngame.\nThe banker-philanthropist is Duke\nM. Farson, prominent in society and\non La Salle street and the much-ad-vertiaed.\npresident , of -the Wetropoli-', 'tan church. The minister Is the\nRev. Edward L. Harvey, pastor of the\nMetropolitan church of Waukesha,\nwhich is part of Farson\'s church syn\ndicate.\nThe charge has to do- with the\n- grabbing. of nearly $4,000 of the es\ntate of a wanderer who entered into\na little mission conducted on Van\nBuren street by Rev. Harvey and\nbacked by Duke Farson.\nThe wanderer was sick in soul and\nI body. He got into the little mission\nI because he wanted to find God. And\n! the linen-frocked Harvey repeated to\n11 him the words of Nazarene. So the\n\' wanderer died in the firm belief that\nHarvey was in touch with God and\ni had guided his footsteps to the Gol-\n: den Ladder.\nIt is perhops well the wanderer died\nwithout finding out too much of the\ni little mission and the sanctity of\nHarvey and the philanthropy of\nBanker Farson.\nFor the charges before the grand\n, jury carry the accusation that when\n1 the wanderer, who was known in his\n, lifetime as Andrew Zuromski, died he\nleft an estate of $6,181 in cash on\ndeposit in the First Trust & Savings.\n! After Public Administrator Devine\ngot through the legal end of dispos\ning of it, there remained $5,264. Of\nthis Zuromski\'s widow received only\n$1,000. Nearly $4,000 went to Har\nvey andFarson, say their accusers;\n$500 went to an agent in the deal\nFrank Messenger and Edward De\nRight, who were formerly connected\nwith the mission, told the story to\nthe grand jury. They are now in the\npublishing business. They said Zu\nromski\'s widow resides in Jersey\nCity.\nAs the alleged robbery of the dead\noccurred in 1909, the statute of lim\nitations has expired in Farson\'s case.\nBecause he has resided continually\nin this city he was not indicted. The\nlaw got its chance with Harvey. He\nmoved to Waukesha a few years ago.\nFarson is a member- of the Farson\nf . illy so prominently identified with ,\nChicago and Lake Forest, society. He\nis head of Duke M. Farson & Co.,\nbond dealers 53 W. Jackson blvd.\nNewspapers have carried columns\nabout his -Metropolitan church and\nhis general "philanthropic and up\nlift" work.\nHarvey is also well known to news\npaper readers. He was of a type that\nfinds it easy to get millionaire sup\nporters for "rescue work in the,\nslums."\nIMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT OF\nIRISH QUESTION PROBABLE\nLondon, Dec. 16. The long-delayed\nsettlement of the Irish question\nis now visible. An amicable union\nof the Uulsterites \'\'and -Southern-Irishmen\nwas nearer today than it\never has been since the futile pas\nsage of the home rule bill in 1914.\nLloyd-George\'s negotiations fol\nlowing the Dublin revolt, which out\nwardly were a failure, nevertheless\nnave been steadily and quietly pro\ngressing. They have now reached a\nstage where a definite favorable an\nnouncement may be expected at any\ntime.\nGERMANY READY TO GIVE FULL\'\nSTATEMENT ON PEACE\nWashineton. Dec. 16. Germany\nstands ready to give the allies a full\nstatement of terms in a peace conference.\nThis statement, was mnrlA nffininllir\nby Count Von Bernstorff, following a\nconference with Sec\'y Lansing today.\nAt the same time Germany is also\nready to discuss disarmament, ere-\'\nation of a league to guarantee per\nmanent peace and kindred subiecta\n4hat would arise from any peace ne\ngotiations.\nPROF. MUNSTERBERG DEAD\nCambridge. Mass.. Dec. 16. Pmf\nHugo Munsterberg of Harvard, noted\nGerman psychologist, dropped dead\ntoday while lecturinerto a class nr.\nstudents-at Radcliffe college.', 'HO, HUM, WE\'LL SEE ABOUT THIS ILL. CENTRAL\nSMOKELESS TOWN WITH LOTS OF MOKE\nAid. Harry Littler, chairman of the\ncity council harbors committee, to\nday gave The Day Book two vital\nreasons why he is against the Illinois\nCentral electrification ordinance of\nfered this week in a grand and gen\nerous manner by Pres. Charlie Mark\nham and the I. C. directors. Aid. Lit\ntler says he believes, the reasons\nwhich influence him are also effec\ntive with the other members of the\nharbors committee. His prediction\nis that -unless the I. C. offers to give\nthe city a whole lot different terms,\nthe ordinance so grandly offered this\nweek, with ,so much grand newspa\nper space, will be kicked from the\ncity hall to the gutters.\n"First of all, I understand the ordi\nnance to mean that with the city\'s\npermission the I. C. will start build\ning a terminal downtown," said Lit\ntler. "It is to have five years in which\nto build. Then its promise is that\nfive years after the terminal is fin\nished it must have completed its elec\ntrification scheme.\n"This means the I. C. wants ten\nyears\' time to work out electrifica\ntion. I believe the harbors commit\ntee is unanimously against a ten\nyear period. The least that could be\nexpected is five years. With any en\ngineering skill at all, we oueht to eet\nelectrification in less than five years.\n"Second, I would ask why the i. u.\nsays nothing in its ordinance about\nelectrifying freight and passenger\ntraffic Nothing but suburban traf\nfic is to beelectrified, according to\nthe proposed ordinance.\n"Freight engines would still be\nfree to smoke as they pleased and to\nscatter smudge and cinders over\nGrant park. Through passenger\ntrains would still be frefe to run into\nthe 12th street station, scattering\nblack dust all along the south lake\nfront. Trees, plants and flowers for\ngardens in Grand park would still be\nchoked. The. unsjghtly.freight yards\nextending from Randolph street,\nrunning under the art institute,\nthrough to the lt2h street station,\nwould not be corrected. In effect the\nlake front Would be just about as\nugly as it is today.\n"We are asked by the I. C. to ap\nprove this ordinance which sanctions\nthe I. C. contract with the South\nPar kboard conveying to the I. C.\nover $20,000,000 worth og lake shore\nland. Before we give any such sanc\ntion we shall demand more than a\nten-year electrification scheme in\nclusive only of suburban traffic. I\nhave talked with harbor committee\nmembers and I am sure they will\nwithhold this permit now as they\nhave in the past"\no o\nMAYOR WOULD SEND SUNDAY\nLID BREAKER TO THE PEN\nMayor Bill Thompson wants viola\ntors of the Sunday closing ordinance\nsent to the pen. He said so today\nwhen he explained that he was going\nto ask Assistant Corporation Coun\nsel and State Rep. Gotthardt Dahl\nberg to introduce a resolution at the\nnext session of the legislature to\namend the closing law so that offend\ners would be liable to a term of from\none to five years.\no o\nTO ARREST AMERICANS FOR\nBREACH OF NEUTRALITY .\nEl Paso, Tex., Dec: 16.

The people in the industry are\nthe worst paid of any of the big cit\nies\' workers. Sol Friedman, general\norganizer of the International Ladies\'\n\' Garment Workers\' union, who is\nr handling the campaign, has sent out\n.the following appeal:\n"A special organizer was sent to\nstart a campaign in these industries\nhere in Chicago. Now, we come to\n. you, men and women, especially\nWomen employed in these industries.\n. Don\'t you think that the women of\nChicago are entitled to the same con\nditions as the women working in the\neastern cities, such as New York,\nPhiladelphia, Boston and Bridgeport.\nIn the eastern cities the women in\nthese industries are working 49\n" hours per week. Here in Chicago\ntheyjare working 52 to 55 hours.\nMinimum scales were established in,\nthese cities where the trades are or\nganized for piece workers and week\n"workers, whereby the workers have\nmade a good living. Here in Chica\ngo the workera can hardly make a\nj living and are working 52 and \'55\nhours per week, because they are not\norganized.\n"In a union shop in height of the\nseason, when the workers are.\nobliged to work overtime, they re\nceive double pay, while here they are\n! not gettingtit. In a union shop they\n\' have a price committee and a shop\nchairman who settles the prices, and\nif the price committee cannot agree\nwith the firm a representative of the\nunion comes up to adjust the matter\nsatisfactorily to the workers. Here\nthe boss is the chairman, the fore\nman the price committee, and you\nmust accept the prices that are of\nfered you by the firm or the foreman.\n"In a union shop a worker cannot\nbe discharged without sufficient\ncause. If a worker is discharged he\nfiles a Complaint with the union. The\ncomplaint is investigated and if the\nrepreesntative of the union finds out\nthat he or she was unjustly dis\ncharged, the worker is reinstated\nwith back pay. Here, you can be dis\ncharged, at any time without any\ncause at all, and as an individual you\nhaven\'t anybody to take your part.\n;"We believe that manufacturers\nwill come to you now, while the\nmovement is being made and prom\nise ybu many things, and even in\nsome cases the workers will be\nraised. This will be only for a short\ntime," and then they will establish\nthe same or still worse conditions\'\nthan before."

He is 37\nnow. We know all the men\'s ages\nin Singapore. But they don\'t know\nDurs," she added, smiling.\nDoris learned more about John\nCarner during the ensuing days. He\nwas the administrator the most\nfeared by the natives. On him de\nvolved the responsibility of the af\nfairs of a province a little larger than\nNew Jersey, and, ten times as pop\nulous.

And Doris was only mildly\nexcited when, ten minutes later, with\nthe yells of the mob ringing in her\nears more loudly, she stepped into\nthe rickshaw with her father.\nAll their native servants had de\nserted them except the faithful rick\nshaw boy. They set off through\nthe empty streets toward the resi\ndency. They were the last of the\nwhite inhabitants to have been\naroused, for their vlla was a consid\nerable distance from the city limits.\nAll went well until they were ac\ntually in sight of the residency, al\nthough the cries were now becoming\nalarming and whole blocks of build\nings were "blazing "furiously. Then,\nas they neared their destination, with\nsavage cries, a party of mutineers\nburst around the block. They car\nried swords and torches and seemed\nbent on massacreing everything in\ntheir path.\nThey spied the rickshaw and\nrushed forward, screiaming. Doris\nhad a cpnfused memory afterward of\nseeing their rickshaw boy fall,\nstabbed through the throat She\nlooked up in horror into the black\nfaces with the wickedly gleaming\neyes.

He placed\nDoris beneath it, swinging her in his\narms as lightly as if she was a feath\ner. Then, sword in hand, he took his\npost before her, while her father,\nseizing a sword from a fallen muti\nneer, stood at his side.\nThe natives had exhausted their\nammunition .in the first outbreak.\nBut they came forward with a rush,\na black, streaming body, shrieking\nmaledictions. And Carner and Hen\nry Banks played their parts nobly.\nIn this imminent danger Doris felt\nherself grow suddenly calm, as if she\nwere a mere spectator at a play. She\nsaw one of the men fall, pierced by\nher father\'s sword, though Henry\nBanks had never handled a sword in\nhis life before. Then he was down\nand Carner was bestride his body,\nfighting like a man possessed. The\nnatives drew off and looked at him in\nawe.

P., do not agree with\nMarkham\'s statement that they are\n"the scum of humanity," neither do\nI agree with J. P. when he calls the\nhobo an animal. The hobo is a hu\nman being, not an animal. Evident\nly J. P. is judging the hobo by him\nself. In the first place, what is a hobo?\nA hobo is an itinerant worker, a man\nwho travels from place to place and\nworks. Some are skilled artesans,\nothers are unskilled and come under\nthe heading of unskilled labor.\n, As to the cause of hoboes, I would\nnot say society caused the hobo.\nThere are many answers to "why is\na. hobo?" Some are hoboes because\nof a desire to travel or wanderlust.\nOthers are hoboes because economic\nconditions cause them to seek else\nwhere for a livelihood. Some are\nmen who have made mistakes and\nhave to keep moving for their health.\n- I am sure the\' hobo- exists on a\nhigher plane than the bum who stays', 'in qp Place, never works and Uvts\non his nerve, or the tramp who roams\nfrom place to place and, like the bum,\nnever works- .\nI have hoboed for .a year, not be\ncause I had to, but because I wanted\nto see some qf the glorious country\nI am living in, and i\' would advise J.\np, to do the eame and possibly be\nwould not ca.u the men he mingled\nwith animals U J, T.\nSWEETUND-REPUES TO "CITI\nZEN." "Citizen" writing in The,\nPay BoqH says: \'"One supreme law\nrules the universe, jiq undue Infer\nence there, that is why it moves so\nelegant, quiet and precise,".\nSince when did "Citizen" or any\nbody ele evtr observe the universe\nas a whole moving in apy fashion\nwhatsoever? Internal movements\nin one\'s body isn\'t a movement of\nthe person, internal movements of\nthe. various parts of the universe is\nwhat "Qitigen" doubtless refers to,\nbut didn\'t mention. .But the different\nparts of the universe, don\'t always\nmove with "elegance, quiet and pre\ncision," They sometimes act just the\nopposite, There is roughness, noise\nand other bad qualities, "\n- positive and negative qualities,\nfood-and bad3ar and peace, life and\neatb are everywhere observable. J\nwill presume that "Citizen," jike the\nPsalmist, has observed the starry\nheaven of a clear night and declared\nit all perfect.

If a boy wants to meet a girl\nand be in her company he will have\nto go to a cabaret or a show to find\nher. And if he goes to her house to\ncall on her the first thing she will do\nis order a bottle of wine. If she does\nas bad as he does, and is partly to\nblame for his actions, then why con\ndemn the boy? I have been in near\nly every city of any importance in\nthe world and find there are very few\ngirls who will\' help a boy to reform.\nThe Day Book is a paper unex\ncelled in other cities. F. D. B.\nHELL HOLES. "Segregation"\nmeans that thousands of our women\nare to be herded in districts where all\nvarieties of tyranny, crime and bru\ntality may scarcely be checked. Land\nmonopoly reduces wages to less than\nsubsistence, and we proceed to col\nlect the victims in places worse than\npenitentiaries. Idle land the cause of\nidle men and women. We can at\nleast allow the victims freedom to\nget the best conditions they can. But ,\nshall house owners harbor such peo\nple? Let them also be free to re\nfuse. There are all degrees of "fallen"\nwomen; few can point them out; and\nwhy do we not object to the men\nwho support them; and how deter\nmine the, degree of degradation that\nrequires segregation? Single tax will\nbring opportunity and wages for\nthese citizens; until we get it, let us\nshow some mercy to the victims of\nlegal monopoly. C. F. Hunt.\nINVITATION TO LONSTON. If\nA. E.

My, what an un\ntruth, when right before our very\neyes is being revealed the very thing\nthe writer says is not so.

C. L. HIT\nBY GILSON GARDNER\nWashington, Dec. 16. One result\nof the1 widely-prevailing labor trou\nbles will be better houses aiid. lower\nrents for workmen. This is to come\nnot as charity, but from the neces\nsity which moves the employer to\nkeep his men and women workers\ncontentedly at his business.\nJL Such was the opinion of Dr. John\nm Nolan of Cambridge, Mass., voiced in\nan address before the American Civic\nass\'n at their convention here in\nWashington.\n"Employers," said Dr. Nolan, "are\nhaving much difficulty in getting and\nholding laborers, and they are al\nready so impressed with the fact that\nthey face new conditions conditions\nwhich entail great inconvenience and\nenormous cost that they are ready\nto consider any practical proposal\nwhich will lessen their troubles."\nOne practical proposal, he pointed\nout, is to reduce the workman\'s rent.\nThe employer has had to face the\nproposition that his employe pays out\ntoo large a proportion of his wages\nfor rent. The ordinary capitalist does\nnot allow over 10 per cent for rent\n10 per cent of either capital or in\ncome. The laboring man pays 25\nor 30 per cent a quarter or even a\nthird of his total earnings for this\none item of rent.\n"Why not get the rent down to a\n10 per cent basis for thd workman?"\nthe employer is beginning to ask.\n"Housing" says Dr. Nolan, "is a\nbig business and should be handled\nas such. More than $2,000,000,000 is\nspent for dwellings in the United\nStates each year; and a large per\ncentage of these" dwellings are poorly\nconceived and wretchedly construct\ned for their purposes.\n"The minimum desirable house of\nfour to five rooms cannot be provided\nin the United States for less than\nabout $1,800 to $2,000, with improve\nments. A house- costing that sum\ncannot be offered on the basis of an\neconomic rent of, say, 5 per cent or 6\nper cent net for less than $15 a\nmonth. Unless a wage earner, with\na normal family of a wife anrthree\ndependent children, has an income\nof $15 a week, or $800 a year, he can\nnot pay $15 a month rent. More than\nhalf of all workingmen receive less\nthan $15 a week.\n"Either the cost of the house and\nlot must be substantially reduced or\nthe standard of healthful living must\nbe lowered or the wages of the poor\nest paid workmen must be raised."\nHow the business of housing can\nbe put on a basis of reasonable re\nturns instead of being the, subject of\nexpensive speculation and exploita\ntion was shown by a practical de\nmonstration carried out in the town\nof Kenosha, Wis., by the leading\nmanufacturer or that town. This\nstory was told in a paper by Alfred\nD. Muller. The paper was read for,\nhim, the author having been killed in\nan automobile accident just as he\nwas about to start for Washington.\nKenosha, it \'seems, was confronted\nwith a housing problem of tremen\ndous difficulties, through a phenom\nenal growth in industrial population,\nchiefly due to the wave of war pros\nperity. Realizing that some remedy\nmust be found, the Manufacturers\nass\'n of that city retained a famouB\nlandscape architect to make a hous\ning survey of the city and to report\na plan. Next they formed a stock\ncompany to build homes for Keno\nsha\'s laborers.\n"Negotiations were opened, says\nthe Muller paper, "with a big western\ncontracting firm and a company\nbuilding ready-cut houses. It was the\nplan of these companies to run a spur\ntrack right onto the land to be built\nupon. Large saw and planing mills\nwere to be set up on the ground and\nthe whole enterprise was planned as\none big operation,', '"At the last moment, however, lo\ncal enterprise came into the field and\nsubmitted plans and cost estimates\nthat seemed more favorable than\n- those of the outside companies,\nwhich were accordingly rejected. \'\n"The agreement between the stock\ncompany of manufacturers and the\nlocal building company called for the\nerection of 400 houses to cost be-"\ntween $1,500 and $2,500. The houses,\nwhen- finished, cost from $1,700 to\n$1,900.\nThe houses were built for cost, plus\n10 per, cent, the local banks agreed\nto finance the proposition upto 65\np\'er cent of the total value and to\ntake. a mortgage for seven years,-the\nKenosha manufacturers taking care\nof the rest.\no o\nA HUMAN TRIANGLE PROBLEM\nREADERS CAN SOLVE IT\nThe readers of The Day Book can\nplay a big part in solving this strange\ntangle of human lives.
