Hon W.\n0. Mays, chairman of the \'Madison\nCounty Republican Committee, will\nsoon issue a call for the county mass\nconvention at Lexington will formu\nconvention at . Lexingtno. will formu\nlate a platform upon which that\' par\nty will go before the voters in the\nstate races in November. . There wlil\nbe practically no contests for nomina\ntoins by the republicans. \'Hon. Ed\nwin Morrow, of Somerset, is al\nready assured of his party\'s nomina\ntion Lfor governor and the candidates\nfor the other places on the ticket are\nbeing "hand-picked" by the leaders, it\nis claimed, in order to select a ticket\nthat may have a chance of winning.\nThe Pantograph said the other day\nthat friends are urging Hon. JG. B.\nMoores to make the race this year\n.for the republican nomination for rep\nresentative in the legislature from\nMadison county, and it. is expected\nhe will yield to the solicitation of his\nfriends and shortly announce"Nhis can\ndidacy. Mr. Moores represented this\ncounty for one term but was defeated\nfor re-election by Judge Rice, who is\nalso expected to be a candidate for re\nnomination and re-election on the\ndemocratic ticket. .\nIn discussing the matter a few days\nago, the political correspondent of\nthe Cincinnati Enquirer mentioned\nLieut. William Wallace, son of Hon.\nC. C Wallace, prominent local repub\nlican leader and attorney, as a pros\npective candidate for the republican\nnomination this year. As Lieut. Wal\nlace is still in Europe. with the Amer\nican forces, his friends seem inclined\nto think that he will not get into pol\nitics this year, anyway. He is now at\ntending the University of Lyons, In\nFrance, a number of . young Ameri\ncans having been given opportunity\nby the government to take some of\nthe higher work in several of France\'s\nworld-renowned . educational institu\ntions, while the army is still kept on\nthe other side. - What the Enquirer\nsaid of Lieut. -Wauacewill be read\nwith interest by his friends, however:\nIt reads as follows: -\n\' A boom hai been- started by Re\npublicans for LieuU-William L. Wal\nlace, who is in France, Jfor the \'repub\nlican nomination for Representative.\nYoung Wallace is a son of. Attorney\nC. XX Wallace1 and , very popular. It\nis expected that he will return to his\nhome in time for his name to gelTon\nthe. August primary ballot: -;.\nThe Lexington Herald had the fol\nlowing about Madison\'s popular Rep\nresentative in the, last houses which\nwill also be read, with interest by his\n" many friends. It said: \' j-\nT Judge Henry Clay Rice, of Madison\n\'.county, will probably make \' the race\nfor renomination , and- re-election as\nrepresentative in the general assembly\nfrom that county.,\';-Judge Rice was\none of the democratic leaders at the\n1918 session and made quite a repu\ntatino as a speaker for measures in\n"which, he was interested as welT as\n"a presiding officer, as he sometimes\n" wielded the gavel when Speaker Rob\nert T. Crowe was not present or when\n: that gentleman vacated the chair tem\npo: arily.: If Judge Rice decides to ask\n- for renomination, it is not likely\' that\nhe will have any opposition.\nCONCERT PROGRAM\nThe program for the next number\n. of the Methodist Lecture Course, to\n,be given by the Home Concert Com\npany, has been announced as follows:\nCommunity Singing.

It is by\nsuch struggles and through such ex\nperiences manhood is measured.\nIn the crucible of -, pain character\nin not only refined but revealed. We\nhonor the men who bravely wear the\n"red badge of courage" on the field\nof battle. Shall we honor less the\nmen who in civil life, with no ap\nplause but the approval of conscience,\nwin their fight in life\'s battle and are\n"faithful unto death?"\n- Of the deeper intimacies of his\nheart his affectionate home life, his\nloyalty and attachment to his friends,\nI sahll not speak.
