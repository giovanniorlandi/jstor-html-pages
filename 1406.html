She was a\nwhite Leghorn; twenty Mars ,ö!d;\nhas raised in her past life 475 little\nchicks and layed in the neighborhood\nof 500 eggs. She came to her death\nfrom a stroke of paralysis." But\nhere is the sad part of the story; "She\nwas sitting on 13 egga under a small\nflower, and by the flower being small\nthe sun was hot, hitting her fair at\nnoon, causing a stroke of paralysis\nof the brain on June 27th, it being\nvery hot day." The old lady was\nfaithful to the laBt, and many a read\ner will drop a tear as they read the\nstory.\nRACIAL POPULATION OF\ntions\n•f\nland\nthat\nthey\nfrom\nsign\neral\nWashington, June 23.—The racial\ncomposiUon of the popu\'ntion of the\nUnited States in 1920, as announced\ntonight by the census bureau shows\nthe country to contain 94,822,431\nwhite persons, 10,463,013 negores,\n242,959 Indtans,^^^pHÎlHH|\n61,086 Chineuse and 9,485 others.\nThe Japanese race exceeded by far\nthe rate of growth in the last ten\nyears of all other classes.\nUnofficial estimates of the increase\nin the number of Japanese in the\nUnited States, particularly on the Pa\ncific coast were borne out in the of\nficial tabulation which revealed a\nrate of expansion of 53.9 per cent,\nduring the decade of 1910-1920, Cal\nifornia absorbed 30,596 of the total\ngrowth of 38,868 Japanese in this\nperiod. On January Î, 1920, there\n■ ere 71,952 Japanese in California.\nThe remainder of the increase was\ndistributed largely in the state of\nWashington where 17,388 now make\ntheir homes; Oregon 4,151, and Utah,\nColorado and New York, with be\ntween two and three thousand each.\nThe white population showed only\na 16 per cent expansion for the do\nade and the negro 6.5 per cent Both\nthe Indian and Chinese groups dwin\ndled 8.6 per cent and 13.8 per cent\nrespectively. The growth in the white\npopulation was considerably less than\nthe rate for the previous decade\nwhich was 22.3 per cent. This decline,\nthe statement said, \\va« due princi\npally to the marked rediU yiop in im\nmigration during the world war.\nAn estimate based on the excess of\nbirths over deaths and on the excess\nof immigration over emigration show\ned a difference by only a small frac\ntion of one per cent, from the total\nwhites enumerated.\nThe greatest numerical increase in\nthe white population was shown in\nthe east north central division, em\nbracing the states of Ohio, Indiana,\nIllinois, Michigan and Wisconsin,\nwhere the increase was 3,011,363.\nThe middle Atlantic states division\nhad a growth for the decade of 2,\n761,505. In the South Atlantic and\ncast and west sfiuth ventral portions\nthe whites showed a combined in\ncrease of 3,580,107.\nThe rate of increase in the negro\npopulation, which was not percepti\nbly affected by immigration or emi\ngration, was the lowest on record, ac\ncording to the statement.\nEvidence of the migration of the\nnegro to the north and west was\nfound m the figures showing nearly\nthree-fourths of the increase in the\nnegro population, or 472,418 of the\n635,250 gain in these sections.\nA growth of only 162,832 or about\none-fuorth was reported for the\nsouth, despite the fact that 85 per\ncent of the total negro race is\nstill belpw the Mason-Dixon line. The\npercentage increase of negroes in the\nwest was 56.1; in the north 43.3 per\ncent and in the southl.9 per cent.\nMichigan, with 60.082 negrpes led\nall states in percentage uf Increase\nwith 261 per cant, Illinois and Ohio\nwith increases of 07.1 per cent, show\ned further evidence of the north\nmovement of negroes.\nPennsylvania negro population\ngrowth for the period was 46.7 per\ncent, its black race now exceeding in\nnumber those of Maryland and Ken\neucky.\nDecrease in the Indian race in the\nten years period was probably due\nin part, it was said to the enumera\ntion, as Indians in\' 1910 and as whites\nin 1920 of persons having only slight\ntraces of Indian blood.\nthe totgl decrease in the Indian\nrace, 22,724—by far the greater part\n18,876 was in Oklahoma alone. The\nonly pronounced increase was repo\ned from Nort Carolina, from 7,851\n11,824. Other states where increases\noccurred were Louisiana, Texas,\nMontana, Arizona and California.

Now and,\nthen there are signs of prosperity; oc\ncasionally the work of a good farmer\ncan be seen, but the soil as a whole\nhas been allowed to deteriorate from\ncontinual taking away of the fertili\nty without any return by the crop\nper, and the old-time indications of\nplenty are gone.

It was truly a "wild-cat" af\nfair, for it was located in one of the\nmost inaccessible places in the county,\nabout four miles south of Port Gibson,\nit was on the Killian place and was\noperated oy Walter Killian, a negro\nwho had heretofore borne a very good\nreputation, and Killian was caught\nin the act of brewing his make.\nThe Sheriff had discovered the place\nseveral nights before, after climbing\nfences and crawling through dense\nunderbrush, but he was caring but\nlittle for the still unless he could bag\nthe "cat" at the same time; and his\npatience was awarded about noon Fri\nday when he found Killian with twe\nbarrels of mash, just ripe, in the act\nof producing a fine lot of"white lightn\nin" for the Saturday trade. He had\nalready completed three quarts.\n■„as arrested and released on a\nof $250 to appear before Justice C.\nB. Tillman.\nThe still is a copper outfit of the\nmost approved type, an dindicated\nthat it had been in constant use fully\ntwo or three weeks. An old discarded\ntin still mutely told that its owner\nhad grown sufficiently prosperous to\nv. arrant a better outfit in order to\nmake a better grade which weuld\nbring a better price and a better class\nof customers.\nKillian had a good line of custo\nmers, for the evidences have been\nstrong for some time that some fel\nlow\'s business was picking up.\nThe minimum sentence for such an\noffense is one year in the penitentiary\nup\nHe\nI ••■ii.!\nHAVE YOU BEEN IN THE FOREST\nAT TWILIGHT?\nHave you been in the forest at twi\nlight,\nWhen the fading light of day\nBy the dusky shadows of evening\nWas silently chased away?\nHave you seen the moon come peeping\nFrom over the distant hill ?\'\nHave you heard the ceaseless croaking\nOf the frogs in the rippling rill?\nHave you watched on the carpet of\ngrass\nThe shadows creep and crawl\nLika the writings of phantom and\nghost\nIn weird fantastic scrawl?\nHave you heard the night owl calling\nTo his mate in the hollow oak\nOr the evening song of thé whippoor-.\nwill\nWho from his day-time nap has\nawoke?\nHave you seen the stately trees\nWith silent majestic mien\nTheir tall heads reverently bow\nTo the forest God unseen ?\nHave you heard their gentle murmurs\nLike sighs of sweet content\nThat they by their gracious Maker\nWere each for a purpose lent?\nHave you been in the forest at twi\nlight\nAt the close of the dying day\nAnd lifted your soul to heaven\nThat sorrow might pass away?\nAnd peace on the wings of the evening\nBe borne to your weary heart\nThat you in the drama called \' Life"\nMight better play your part?\nEDNA L.

The speech for\nwhich Admiral Sims was recalled\nfrom England was, in substance,\nfollows:\n"I do not want to touch on the Irish\nquestion, for I know nothing about it,\nand have not run across anybody in\nEngland who does. But there are some\npeople in our country who technically\nare Americans, some of them are nat\nuralized and some native born, but\nsome of them are not really Ameri\ncans at all. Some of these people\nnow trying to destroy the good rela\ntions between our two countries. They\na»e Americans when they want money\nbut Sinn Fein when on the platform.\nThey are enemies of yours and ours.\nThey are like the zebra—either white\nhorses with black stripes or black\nhorses with white stripes. We know\nthat they are not horses. And some\npeople think they are asses; but each\none of these asses had a vote and it\nis one of the inconveniences of a re\npublican form of government, that\nAmerican born citizens thought it nec\nessary to cater to these votes. This\nnecessarily created a wrong impres\nsion on thU side as to the sentiments\nof the great body of Americans, but\nthe people of Great Britain know how\nmuch confidence to place in the reso\nlutions which are forced by these\njack ass votes.\n"Eleven years ago I made a proph\nesy which came true. I will venture\nanother now. I believe I shall live to\nsee the day when the English-speak\ning people of the world will come to\ngether in bonds of eomradship; and if\nthey do, they will be able to run this\nround globe. Personally, I believe I\nshall live to see an inter-English speak\ning policy, and When we have that we\nshall have all that is needed to secure\npeace and prosperity in the world."\nas\nan\nBEGINNING TO USE THE\nMISSISSIPPI RIVER ROUTE\nThe Houston, Texas, Chronicle has\nthe following to say regarding the\ntrip, largely over the Mississippi Riv\ner Highway of a member of its staff:\nTraveling in a new Ford touring\ncar, Mr. and Mrs. R. A. Sell and\ndaughter, Ruth, of Houston Heights,\nleft Wednesday on an all-summer\n8000-mile motor tour. Mr. Sell a\ncontributing member of The Chroni\ncle staff, will have sketches from time\nto time in the automotive section un\nder the title "Roving Impressions."\nThe tour is being partly made un\nder auspices of the Mississippi River\nScenic Highway, which the Sells will\ntraverse on the Southern and North\nern ends. The route from Houston\nis Eastward to New Orleans, via\nBeaumont and Orange; thence on the\nOld Spanish Trail to Mobile; thence\nnorth along the Atlantic seaboard\nto Philadelphia; thence to New\nYork City. From the national metro\npolis the Sells will go Westward on\nthe Lincoln Highway to Chicago, there\npicking up the Mississippi River Sce\nnie Highway and following it to its\nssä&ss sä\nen Southward to Minneapolis, where\nthe Yellowstone Trails will be picked\nup. The itinerary then lies through\nPelowstone Park and home via the\nColorado route through the Texas\nPanhandle.
