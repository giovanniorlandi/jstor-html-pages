per\nmitted to treat in your columns\nand after the notices and queries\nwhich I have received there are\npoints on which I should like if\nyou will allow me to set myself\nmyselfdght\nand have spoken throughout as\nan inquirer not as a teacher\n1st I heartily accept evolu\ntion and abandon the traditions\nwhich it has displaced I would\nonly be on my guard against being\nJ\ning carried away as by great dis\ncoveries we are in danger of be\nt ing Evolution as so far revealed\nis physical It has not yet under\ntaken to account for the higher\nman his gifts his ideas his aspi\nrations I do not suppose that\nJ there is any miraculous change if\nthat development is not continu\nous Yet there may be an essen\ntial change as there is from the\ngerm to the living man There is\nI believe as yet no attempt to ac\ncount for the potentiality of the\ngerm which in its way is perhaps\nas great a miracle as the poten\ntiality intellectual moral and\nspiritual of the physical man\nAlan aloneof all races is progress\nive This in itself is a distinc\nf tion absolute and essential be\n4him and the brutes\n42nd I have not broached any\nextra doctrine of the freedom\nf + tr itx > iaQU shse\nits spring III Â° motive motive m\ncharacter and the complex in\nfluences which form it I only\nventure to demur to the necessar\nian theory as opposed to our con\nsciousness while by excluding\nfreedom it excludes anything that\ncan be truly called morality or\nmoral judgment of action It as\nsumes that the motive is the sole\nfactory To me it appears that\nthere are twothe motive and the\nvolition In actions which are\nmatter of course we are not con\nscious of the duality In doubt\nful actions where there is a con\nflict of motives we are Upon\nwhat other theory can moral re\nsponsibility or consciousness ex\nist\nist3rd\n3rd The leaning to orthodoxy\nwith which I am gently reproach\ned does not go beyond a convict\nion drawn from the study not of\ntheology but of history that of\nall the types of character hitherto\nproduced the Christian type\nfounded on a belief in the father\nhood of God and the brotherhood\nof man appears to be the happi\nest and the best At its birth it\nencountered alien and hostile in\nfluences Alexandrine theosophy\nOriental asceticism Byzantine\nimperialism Later it encounter\ned the worst influences of all\nthat of theocracy engendered by\nthe ambition of the monk Hilde\nbrand Theocracy not Catholi\ncism or anything spiritual has\nbeen the source of the crimes of\nthe Papacy of the Norman raids\nupon England and Ireland the\ncivil wars kindled by papal in\ntrigue in Germany the extermi\nnation of the Albigenses the In\nquisition Alvtis tribunal of\nblood in the Netherlands the\nmassacre of St Bartholomew the\npersecution of the Hugenots Jes\nuitism and the unspeakable evils\nreligious moral and political\nwhich Jesuitism has wrought\nThrough all this and in spite of\nit all Christian character has pre\nserved itself and it is still the\nbasis of the worlds best civili\nzation Much that is far outside\nthe Christian creed is still Christ\nian in character and traceable to\na Christian source\n4th I fully admit that society\ncan be regulated by a law framed\nfor mutual protection and general\nwellbeing without the religious\ni conscience or other support than\nR general interest But if individ\nual interests or passion can break\nthis law with impunity as often\n1 jthis\n<\nr\nthey can what is there to with\nhold them from doing it7 What\nis the value of a clean breast 7\n5th The fatherhood of God\nseems to be implied in the Christ\nian belief in the brotherhood of\nman By using the phrase I\nmeant to designate Christianity\nnot to open the question of The\nism which in itself I have not\nattempted to deal It does not\nseem possible that we should ever\nhave direct proof through human\nobservation and reasoning of the\nexistence of Deity or of the di\nvine aim and will To some pow\ner and apparently to some moral\npower we must owe our being\nWo can hardly believe that cre\nation planned itself or that the\ngerm endowed itself with life and\nprovision for development But\nwhat can have been the aim of\ncreation 7 What can have led to\nthe production of humanity with\nall the evil and suffering which\nOmniscience must have foreseen 7\nWhat was there which without\nsuch a process mere flat so far\nas we can see could not produce\nThe only thing that presents it\nself is character which apparent\nly must be selfformed and de\nveloped by resistance to evil We\nhave had plenty of evidences\nin the manner of Paley of the\nBridgewater Treatises met by\nskeptical argument on the other\nside but has inquiry yet tried to\nfathom the mystery of human ex\nistence r\nistence6th\n6th One thing for which I\nhave earnestly pleaded is the\nabolition nf clenal tea tsIqu e\nare lUlaetJ renunCIatIons of ab\nsolute loyalty to truth Would\nthis involve the dissolution of\nthe churches 7 Nothing surely\nan put an end to the need of\nI spiritual association or to the use\nfulness of the pastorate so long\nas we believe in spiritual life I\nthink I have seen the most gifted\nminds such as might have done us\nthe highest service in the quest of\ntruth condemned to silence by\nthe tests\ntestsBIBLE\nBIBLE REVISION\nBy Josephine K Henry\nThe Pope has ordered a new re\nvision of the Vulgate or Latin\nversion of the Bible\nI\nThe Pope has placed the work\nin the hands of Abbot Gaspuet\nthe head of the Order of Bene\ndictines the Abbot to select his\nlearned associates to revise and\ncorrect Gods word which has\nbeen proclaimed the inerrant and\ninfallible word of God since the\nlast doctoring it had at the hands\nof the clergy\nI do not know whether the laity\nwill be punished for believing and\nliving up to the mistakes in the\nversion now to be revised It\nreally seems it would not be just\nto punish them but the ways of\nprovidence are past finding out\nBible revision has been going on\nfor ages and Doctors of Divinity\nhave had a trust on the business\nIt always seemed to me sacrileg\nious to be a Doctor of God Surely\nthe Almighty the AllWise All\nPowerful and Perfect God do S\nnot need the doctoring of puny\nmen and it seems to me a peril\nous presumption to be a D D a\nDoctor of God Every prayer\noffered is an attempt to revise\nand direct Gods methods of deal\ning with his creatures and such\ndictation exaggerates the ego of\nthe dictator and revisor until it\nseems to annul the will and word\nof the Father Son and Holy\nGhost Why should Gods word\never have been revised 7 Surely\nGod knew what he wanted to\nsay to the human race and how\nto say it\nWhen an ordinary mortal\nwrites a book it is against the law\nfor others to quote without cred\nit correct revise eliminate and\nadd to the contents if they do\nthey are held accountable by the\nauthor and the world condemns\nthem as literary purloiners and\nmeddlers But when God wrote\nr\na book the whole Christian world\nproceeded to tear the Divine lit I\nerary production into shreds\nthrowing out whole books revis\ning and interpolating chapters\nand sentences declaring that God\nwrote this but he did not write\nthat The inspired word they\nkeep in Gods book and the unin\nspired word they throw out and\nall this time while such liberties\nwith the Bible are being taken\nthe Divine Author enters not a\nword of protest against the pre\nsumption of worms in the dust\nfor tampering with the divine lit\nerary production Surely thus is\nan evidence that God is long suf\nfering under great provocation\nIt is written Man is made in\nthe image of God some men do\nnot reflect great credit on their\nmaker and cannot certainly be\nan improved edition of their hea\nvenly Father But certain it is\nwhether men resemble their heav\nenly parent or not they must\nwrite perplexingly like God for\nthe religious world has never\nbeen able to agree as to how much\nof the Holy Scriptures were writ\nten by God and how much by his\ncreatures mere men\nThe Bible says if you sin\nagainst the Holy Ghost you can\nnot be forgiven in this world or\nthe world to come Surely the\nBible revisionists put themselves\nin jeopardy since God writes so\nalarmingly like man the world\nhas never decided which was\nwhich and now the Pope Gods\nrepresentative on earth finds it\nnecessary to make another trial\nto find out what God did or did\nnot write\nDoes it not seem strange that\nGod should afflict his representa\ntive on earth with the gout 7 Sure\nly he cannot represent divinity as\nably or effectually with the gout\nas without it but we are taught\nthatGod\nGod moves in a mysterious way\nHis wonders to perform\nIt is claimed that Jehovah the\nGod of the Jews wrote the Old\nment This before tIle\ntJLtSJOHjiliTji1 1 lhTh was U A V v v\nSon aml the Holy Ghost became\nparts of the Godheadthe Trin\nity three Gods in one yet only\none God If Jehovah was the ex\nclusive author of the Old Testa\nment he certainly proves himself\nnot only a writer of the ages be\nfore whom all the warriors of the\nages appear like tin soldiers\nFrom the murder of Abel with\nwhich God begins his book to the\nmurmurings of Malachi where\nThus saith the Lord yet I loved\nJacob and I hated Esau and laid\nhis mountains and his heritage\nwaste for the dragons of the wil\nderness where as Edom saith\nWe are impoverished but he will\nreturn and build the desolate\nplaces Thus saith the Lord of\nhosts They shall build and I will\nthrow down the oeople against\nwhom the Lord hath indignation\nforever One has but to read Jehovahs\nbook to find out that the sacred\nauthor was in a towering rage\nfrom Genesis to Malachi whose\nlast words are Lest I come and\nsmite the earth with a curse\nnearly every page of the Old Tes\ntament is drenched in blood and\nif all the murders recorded there\nin were counted in comparison\nthe warfare of nations would ap\npear insignificant It is to be\nhoped that the Popes Bible revis\nionists will give careful statistics\nregarding murder theft de\nbauchery female conunodity ly\ning deceit hypocrisy and cow\nardice all of which are taught in\none single chapter Genesis 34\nand treated of in realistic style\nthroughout the entire book A\nBible student will observe that\nthe divine author considered his\nfinest chapter for he gives it\ntwice over word for word These\nidentical chapters are 19th chap\nter of 11 Kings and 37th chapter\nof Isaiah God must have con\nsidered this the most important\npart of His book to have repeated\nit twice over It is up to the re\nvisionists to interpret this re\npeated chapter for it was high\ntime it was explained so that the\nworld may know what bearing it\nhas on the salvation of the hum\nan race We are told to search\nthe scriptures to find eternal\nlife All who desire eternal\nlife would do so if they could\nonly find out what the Scriptures\nare and what they mean\nCertainly the only twice re\npeated chapter in the Holy Book\nmust be genuine A volume could\nc\nbe written on this one chapter\nand the Popes revisionists should\nconcentrate their learning on it\nFor the life of me I cannot see\nwhat bearing it has on eternal\nlife How Hezekiah Eliakim\nShebna Babshaken Yirakah Go\nzan Haran Rezeph Hamath\nSennacherib Andrammellach and\nSharzer from the cities of Sepha\nraim Hena and Ivah lead to\neternal life cannot be found\nout by careful reading Who these\ncelebrities were or where these\ncities were the Lord in heaven\nonly knows or ever will know\nunless the Popes revisionists dig\nup this knowledge\nTwo verses of the chapter need\nspecial attention The 28th verse\nI says Because thy rage against\nme and thy tumult is come up\nI into mine ears therefore I will\nI put lay hook in thy nose and my\nbridle in thy lips and I will turn\nI thee back by the way thou com\nI estl Now this hook in the nose\nI business would scare the ordina\nI ry mortal away from the search\nI for eternal life and if one is to\nI be turned back with a hook in\nthe nose and a bridle in the lips\nit would save the pain and humil\niation to let the revisionists find\nthe path But the most startling\nthing in literature is the 35th\nverso of this wonderful chapter\nIt says And it came to pass that\nnight the angel of the Lord went\nout and smote in the camp of the\nAssyrians an hundred four score\nand five thousand j and when they\narose early in the morning be\nhold they were all dead corpses\nNow what do you think of that\nOne angel slew 185000 Assyr\nians in one night This exceeds\nany warlike demonstration from\nthe time of the war in heaven\nwhen Satan was thrown over the\nbattlements to the battle of Muk\nden One angel like that would\nhave been invaluable in our Civil\nWar or to Russia in its late un\npleasantness with Japan But\nthink of 185000 soldiers being\nslain in one night and waking up\nearly in the morning to find them\nselves dead corpses Of course\nif tidy had found themselves liv\ning corpses the fate and fame of\nthat angel would have been dif\nferent If military execution in\nsures a clear title to angelhood\nthis angel could certainly Read\nhis title clear to mansions in the\nskies\nThe 24th verse of this chapter\nwhich also needs the attention of\nthe revisionists says I have\ndigged and drunk strange waters\nand with the sole of my feet have\nI dried up all the rivers of besieg\ned places It does not say who\nthese feet belonged to but who\never possessed them certainly de\nserved their name recorded in\nHoly Writ\nPaul says a pertinent thing in\n2 Thessalonians 211 which may\nhave some bearing on this won\nderful chapter God shall send\nthem strong delusion and they\nshall believe a lie\nThe responsibility of Bible re\nvisionists is fearful for the Bible\nsays they shall incur the penalty\nof having their names taken out\nof the Lambs Book of Life if\nthey add one jot or tittle to the\nHoly Book So many well mean\ning searchers of the Scriptures\nhave their passports to heaven by\nadding to and taking away from\nthe Word of the Law until but\nlittle is left but jots and tittles\nBut two members of this Trin\nity were authors God the Fath\ner it is claimed wrote the Old\nTestament and the Holy Ghost\nwrote the New Testament God\nthe Son wrote no books He left\nnot a line or a word of his com\nposition ft is recorded by the\nHoly Ghost that on one occasion\nGod the Son wrote on the\nsand St Jerome and St Chrys\nostom who are accepted as au\nthority by the Pope both say God\nthe Son could not write or read\neither When God wrote the Bible he\ngave it in keeping to the Jews\nThey were not to read it he com\nmanded them to Take the Book\nof Law and put it into the side\nof the Ark of the Covenant of the\nLord your God that it may be\nthere for a witness against thee\nDent 3126 The ark was to\nbe kept in the holiest recess of\ntho temple and the high priest\nwas ordered in Leviticus 102\nNot to come at all times into\nthe holy places within the veil be\nfore the mercyseat which is upon\nthe ark that he die not\nIn 1 Samuel 1819 it is

In America had\nbeen crowned with success he had\nearned the full reward of a quiet life\nBut such was not to be Edmund\nBurkes Reflection of the Revolution\nIn Franco demanded a reply and\nThe Rights of Man was printed\nThe work was so popular that It had\nan Immense sale and revealed so truly\nthe condition of the country and its\nrulers that it brought down the censure\nof the government\nThe Rights of Man was almost as\npopular in England as his Common\nSense had been in America In Febru\nary 1792 the second part was printed\nIn May the King Issued a proclamation\nsuppressing all seditious and libellous\nworks That same day the Attorney\nGeneral commenced a suit against\nPaine The trial was appointed for\nthe following December In September\nbefore the trial he was elected to the\nNational Convention of France and\nwas not In England at the time of the\ntrial He was found guilty\nPaine says Every ago and genera\ntion must be free to act for itself In\nall cases as the ages and generations\nwhich preceeded it The vanity the\npresumption of governing beyond the\ngrave is the most ridiculous and inso\nlent of all tyrannies Man has no\nproperty In man neither has any gen\neration a property in the generations\nwhich are to follow\nI am contending for the right of the\nliving and against their being killed\naway and controlled and contracted\nfor by the manuscript authority of the\ndeadHereditary\nHereditary succession is a burlesque\nupon monarchy It puts It in the most\nridiculous light by presenting it as an\noffice which any child or idiot may fill\nIt requires some talent to be a common\nmechanic but to be a king requires\nonly the animal figure of man a sort of\nbreathing automaton This sort of\nsuperstition may last a few years now\nbut it cannot long resist the awakened\nreason and interest of man\nHe desired to make a Republic of\nFrance as he had of America When\nhe had so far succeeded that Louis XVI\nwas dethroned and the Revolutionary\nwork done in one direction he was hu\nmane enough to vote against the Kings\ndeath and not only that but to speak\nagainst capital punishment in general\nThe Republicans of France had no such\nconception of liberty as had Thomas\nPaine and his desire to preserve the\nlife of the man after the dethroning\nof the King brought him trouble\nbrought his almost to the guillotine\nHe was imprisoned as a foreigner by\nthose he had tried to teach the mean\nIng of liberty No wonder he exclaim\ned Ah France Thou hast ruined the\ncharacter of a revolution virtuously be\ngun and destroyed those who procured\nIt\nIt seems strange that with all his\nsuffering for the help be gave to hu\nnianltl he still persisted in his work\nfor freedom He best explains It In\nthese words\nWhat I write Is pure nature and\nmy pen and my soul have ever gone\ntogetherWhat\nWhat was lacking was the men to\nappreciate his work The freedomlov\ning men to understand and help him\nPaine was called a foreigner and sent\nto prison No charge was made against\nhim He remained there nearly ten\nmonths because no American of author\nity claimed him Most of his friends In\nFrance were guillotined and he would\nhave been but for the care or careless\nness we do not know which of the man\nwho marked the doors of condemned\nprisoners Paine was ill and his door\nbeing open when marked made the\nmark come on the Inside when the door\nwas closed and so was not visible\nwhen the headsman went his rounds\nWe have seen the warrlod side of\nPaine but he had another side or\nmany sides He was an inventor of\ngreat ability Among other things he\ninvented a smokeless candle The\nflame going out at one end of the can\ndle the smoke at the other He also\ninvented a planing machine and crane\nbut the best of all was the iron bridge\nHe not only Invented the bridge but\nwas capable of making his own models\nLiberty was his Ideal and slavery\nof body or mind found In him a deadly\nenemy t\nHis faculties were even being exer\ncised for the good of his fellow cre\natures The immense range of his\npower seems marvelous and his in\nsight most keen and wonderful Any\nthing of Interest to man was of Interest\nto him and any place in need of a\nworker was a legitimate field for his\nlabor Paines boyhood was passed in\nthe sombre drab colored existence ot\na Quaker home His seriousness of\nlife and grave promise of practical re\nsults in the thinking world when he\nshould reach maturity\nIn speaking of an existence in his\nboyhood he says I well remember\nwhen about seven or eight years of age\nhearing a sermon read upon the sub\nject of what is called Redemption by\nthe death of the Son of God After the\nsermon was ended I went into the\ngarden and as I was going down the\ngarden steps for I perfectly remember\nthe spot I revolted at the recollection\nof what I had heard and thought to\nmyself that it was making God Al\nmighty act like a passionate man and\nkilled his son when he could not re\nvenge himself in any other way and as\nI was sure a man would be hanged that\ndid such a thing I could not see for\nwhat purpose they preached sermons\nThis was not one of that kind of\nthoughts that had anything in it of\nchildish levity it was to me a serious\nrecollection arising from the idea I lad\nthat God was too good to do such an\nauction and also too almighty to be\nunder any necessity of doing it I be\nlieve in the same manner at this mo\nment and I moreover believe that any\nsystem of religion that has anything In\nit which shocks the mlttd of the child\ncannot be a true system\nSo we see that the idea that Christ\nwas not crucified because that was too\nwicked for God to do was believed by\nhim when only eight years old and\nfifty years afterward he adds any\nsystem of religion that has anything\nIn It that shccks the mind of a child\ncannot be a true system\nWe are little able in the present\nday to appreciate the reverence with\nwhich Paine was regarded by those\nwho saw in him the greatest apostle\nof liberty In the world Elihu Palmer\nspoke a very general belief when he\ndeclared Paine probably the most use\nful man that ever existed upon the\nface of the earth\nFinally he came home to America\nHo always bad many friends but\nmany deserted him as his Age of\nReason became known to them He\nwas neglected by those who would be\nexpected to stand by him\nProbably the worst blow he ever\nreceived was to have the right to\nvote refused him in New York on the\nground that he was not a citizen of\nthe United Slates Not a citizen of\nNew York when the home in which\nhe lived had been presented to him\nby the State of New York for his serv\nices In making it a state and he had\nlived on money presented to him by\nPennsylvania for his services there\nNot a citizen I Can Christianity with\nIts pretence of charity and brotherly\nlove go to such an ertent as that In\nprejudiceYet\nYet Incredible as It appears such\nIs the case and George Washington\nwrote that the one who refused\nPaines vote did rightly and Paine\ndied before the courts of New York\nrecognized him as a citizen after that\ngratuitous iusult\nThese patriots had worked with\nhim as far as their limited sight\ncould determine was right but when\nhe could see a horizon beyond them\nthey refused to go and put all possi\nble obstacles in his way They for\ngot he had been their nurse and guide\nIn Republican childhood forgot they\nwere given a measure of freedom\nthrough his efforts forgot gratitude\nto an old friend forgot honor forgot\nthey were human beings and so de\nserted this grand warrior who loved\ni peace so much that he would fight for\nnothing else\nr', 'BLUE GRASS BLADE\nFOUNDED 1S84\nDy\nCHARLES CHILTON

criticism of my article in which\nI stated that an allegorical con\nstruction of the Bible would de\nstroy the literal sense in toto He\ncommences by saying Well\nthe literal meaning is of no val\nue I did not say tho literal\nmeaning was of any value Mr\nWeaver says that He is simply\nquarreling with himself in that\ncase I said that an allegorical\nconstruction would destroy the\nliteral meaning in toto and say\nso yet He then says Berry\ntakes the Bible as it reads So do\nother orthodox people That\nwould imply tttat lair Weaver\ndoes not taKe it as n reads We\nwonder WhO employed rr Wea\nver to write up allegorical moles I\nbur the people and put allegorical\nconstruction on those already\nwritten Mr weaver then classes me as\nan orthodox V cry compliment\nary mr Weaver indeed 1 re\nnounced orthodoxy over lilty\nyears and embraced Freethougut\nuut Here is what Of beats the bugS\nAir Weaver says that the word\nallegory means Uodtalk And\nHe cites Paul as his authority\nWhere no gets such a meaning of\nthe word allegory as that Uod\nonly knows 1 That must be one\nof his own getup W e never saw\nsuch a rendering as that in any\ndictionary And as for Paul he\nsays that he told a lie that the\ngrace of Uod might the more\nabound Perhaps he lies a little\nwhen he tells Mr AV eaver to read\nthe Bible as an allegory\nHe also says that Mind is call\ned Adam We are now four\nscore years of age but outside of\nMr Weaver we have never seen or\nheard of such a rendering of the\nlerm Mind as that before Tha\nis Mr Weavers own allegorical\ndefinition of the word Mind we\nsuppose In that case we wonder\nwhat his definition of the word\nAdam would be\nIn our article we asked What\nbecame of the female or woman\ncreated on the sixth day He\nsays Maybe Berry can tell us\nwhat her name is and if he does\nthen we will tell him all about\nherI Now we contend that\nsounds a little allegorical for if\nhe is able to tell us all about her\nhe ought to be able to tell us her\nname himself Now we are ready\nto wager one years subscription\nto the Blue Grass Blade that Mr\nWeaver cant tell us a particle\nmore about that woman than we\nourself know He can give his\nopinion but opinions are not\nproofs We think he is patterning a\nwee bit after Paul in this case\nAgain he says Berry claims\nthat no Savior is mentioned in\nthe Old Testament Wo said that\nthe word Jesus was not mention\ned consequently no crucified\nSavior spoken of in the Old Tes\ntament Berry does not claim\nit as ho says I The Book itself\nsays 1 0\nWeaver says that Jehovah and\nJesus are the same person Now\nwhoever heard of such a far\nfetched conclusion as that No\nme outside of Mr Weaver\nAgain he says Bro Berry\nought to remember that the the\nancients had no good language I\nWe dont know just how good a\nlanguage they had but one thing\nwe do know and that is we dont\nhear of them calling the mind\nAdam nor Jehovah Jesus Neith\nI er do we find reason personified as\nJehovah or Jesus for we dont\nfind anything very reasonable\nabout either one of them\nAnd finally he says If Bro\nBerry and other socalled Free\nthinkers would try to learn some\nthing and stop copying from the\nancients they could uproot or\nthodoxy in a year Now we\nwould spend\nsay if Bro Weaver\nhis time in trying to teach the\npeople how to live good honest\nmoral lives instead of calling\nthem ugly names as he has done\nme he will no doubt have as many\nfriends He says that most Liberals de\nlight to abuse those who differ inI\nopinion with them which state\ntent we denounce as untruthful\nIt is only from such men as Mr\nWeaver we hear such talk as that\nAnd in closing we wish to say\nthat we can respect Mr Weaver\nas a man but not as a gentleman\nuntil he rescinds the uncalled for\nabusive epithets applied to me as\nwell as to all Liberals in general\nNatl Military Home\nRAVPJRR V INTOFRSOLI\nBy Joel M Berry\nIt is stated in the Bible that the\nDevils believe It would seem\nfrom this that belief is not such\na meritorious thing after all Is\nit possible that God will hate his\nenemies when he tells us we must\nlove ours lie says he takes ven\ngeance on his adversaries The en\nemies of God cannot injure him\nours can How could you injure\na conditionless being Is it nec\nessary to believe in the existence\nof an infinite intelligence before\nyou can know right and wrong\nBanish me from the Garden of\nEden as quick as you please but\nfirst give me a bountiful feast\nfrom the tree of knowledge I\nwant no part in hell where the\nsaved drown with merry shouts\nthe cries and sobs of hell Against\nthis heartless doctrine every hon\nest soul should enter his solemn\nprotestBy\nBy putting intention back of\nwhat man called good God was\nproduced Then by putting in\ntention back of what man called\nbad the devil was created Leave\nthe intention out and gods and\ndevils fade away\nawayWhy God of infinite\nwisdom wish to experiment with\nman Y The very thought of such\na thing is a slander upon his dig\nnity If God knew that his book\nwould be understood differently\nby each one then my understand\ning of the Bible is the real revel\nation to me If this is so I have\nno right to take tho understand\ning of another It will not do to\nsay that the universe was created 4\nand then say that such creation\nwns miraculous Who knows that\nthe universe was created Wo\nmust not jump at conclusions If\nit was not created and has existed\nfrom all eternity then the mirac\nulous is impossible No miracle\ncan be established by human tes\ntimony i but throw away the mir\nacles of the New Testament and\nall tho other teachings of Christ\ndont amount to a grain of sand\nIt is impossible to establish anyI\ncreed or system of faith and be a\nlief by a miracle Like all other\nreligions Christianity is a mix\nture of good and evil The church\nhas made more orphans than it\nhas fed It has never built asy\nlums enough to hold the insane of\nits own making It has shed\nmore blood than light\nIn speaking of the imaginary\nheaven and hell Ingersoll says\nThey the church put a master\ntyrant in the sky and warm their\nhands at the imaginary fires of\nHell Then says It is re\nlated of Horace Greeley that one\ncold day he went into a country\nstore i sat down by the fire threw\nout his hands in the act of warm\ning when the store boy camo

great stone\nof Abel whereon they set down\nthe ark of the Lord which stone\nremaiueth unto this day in the\nfield of Joshua the Bethshemite\nInstead of placing his book in the\nark one would suppose if God\nreally wanted to guide his child\nvon to eternal life he would\nhave seen to it that it had a wide\ncirculation but he did not und\ninstead because some of the men\nof Bethsheuiesh peeped into

three score and ten men\ni\nand the account seems to indicate\nthat the people of Kirjathjeari\nwere scared nearly to death und\nno wonder when 50070 men were\nkilled because two of their neigh\nbors had looked into the box that\nheld Gods Book No one knew\na word that was in the book but\nin Exodus 2522 we are told God\nsaid to Moses There I will\nmeet thee and I will common\nwith thee from above the mercy I\nseat from between the two the\nubims which are upon the Ark of\nthe testimony of all things which\nI will give teehethezddddw fw\nI will give thee in commandment\nunto the children of Israel\nMoses is considered a model of\nmeekness but he should also have\nbeen famous for his bravery to\nmeet God at the mercyseat in the\nArk after the divine author had\nkilled 50070 men for merely look\ning into the box that held the\nbookWhat\nWhat the people were doing for\nspiritual guidance all this time\nI do not know but it is up to the\nis recorded that the Ark contain\ning the Book of the Law was not\nopened until in the reign of Sol\nomon And when the Ark was\nopenedthink of the terror of\nthe discovery Gods Book was\nnot there\nThe Ark is never heard of\nagain except in intimation that\nJeremiah hid it in a cave on Alt\nPisgah Jeremiah was lucky to\nhave escaped with his life but\nhe seems to have spent the rem\npant of his days writing the La\nmentations of Jeremiah

evolved the\nfire the scaffold the dungeon the\nrack All the ink that has beer\nshed in producing its millions of\ncopies is a mere drop in the buck\net to the merciless deluge of\nblood with which it has dreachec\nthe fireblackened plains and\nruined cities of the world And\nthe fetters of iron which it has\nriveted upon the limbs of the\nmost valiant of our race are oj\nnothing to the shackles of

Rome must be\nin the throes of evolution for the\nPope to order a revision of the\nBible for Rome has always op\nposed its translation out of the\noriginal tongues If the re\nvisionists are seized

Catholics should never\nneglect going to confession for\nthey have grievous sins to be for\ngiven God does not seem to want\nhis children to understand his\nbook perhaps for the reason the\nless they

wading\nthrough cruelty brutality ob\nscenity and conglomerate non\nsense to find eternal life\nThink of a human being count\ning the letters in the Bible and\nfinding 2567180 hunting for the\nmiddle chapter and finding it to\nbe Job 29th and that the word\nJehovah occurs 6885 times\nThink of wasting time and vital\nity with such things on the idea\nthat it was serving God and se\ncuring eternal life\nDid you ever try to find any\nthing in the Bible Y It is much\neasier to find the Lost Tribes of\nIsrael Melchisadek the Lost\nChord or the man that struck\nBilly Patterson The preachers\nand the Pope himself cant dc\nit without a concordance and\naside from a few threadbare texts\nnot one person in a million can\nquote six verses correctly and\ntell where they can be found You\ncan tell the most devout Bible\nstudents of a hundred unprinta I\nble things in the Bible and they\nivill vow they are not there and\nI when you show them they de\nvoutly say We are not allowed\nto understand such mysteries it\ndocs not mean what it says\nBible quoters generally make a\nmuddle of it An old man I knew\nwho carries a Bible in his pocket\nrecently said to me that this win i\nter had been hard on him He I\nsaid I am out of work my cow\ndied and now my folks are down\nwith the pneumonia but I always\ntrust in the Lord The Bible\nsays Whom the Lord loveth he\nchasteth and it looks like the\nLord has been chasing me up hill\nand down dale for the past sixty\nyears\nyearsThe\nThe Popes Bible revisionists\nshould make it plain why for the\nsouls salvation it is necessary\nto know that Shorn begat Arp\ntaxed Eber begat Peleg and Ha\nran begat Lot and to keep up\nwith the progeny of a few thou\nsand more Bible gentlemen It\nseems to me such Bible students\nare entitled to a longer eternal\nlife than usual It ought to be ex\nplained how the 28th and 29th\nverses of the sixth chapter of\nKings can promote good morals\nft says And the King said un\nto her what aileth thee Y And she\nanswered This woman said unto\nme Give thy son that we may\neat him today and we will eat\nthy son tomorrow So we boiled\nmy son and did eat him and I\nsaid unto her on the next day\nGive thy son that we may eat him\nand she hid her son How in\ntlie name of common sense can\nthat help people to get to heaven\nThose women should not only\nhave their names taken from the\nchurch books but from the\nLambs Book of Life also I\ndope for the sake of good morals\nthat the Popes revisionists will\nfind out that God did not write\nthe Songs of Solomon and the\nBook of Ruth They seem en\ntirely unworthy of a divine au\nthor The revisionists should\nsettle once for all whether the\nHebrew chronology or that of the\nSeptuagint is correct The He\nbrew account says Abraham was\nborn 2083 years after God created\nthe world and the Septuagint\njays it was 3549 years after God\ncreated the heavens and the\nearth A little difference of\nL466 years is a slight discrepancy\nbut the world should know the\ncorrect date of the birth of Abra\nham for all thesaints expect to\nrest in his bosom The Bible re\nvisionists have a fearful respon\nibility as millions have placed\nheir destiny in Bible truth\nThere are a few thousand other\ndiscrepancies mysteries and con\nradictions in the Holy Book that\nshould be submitted to the revisionists\nisionists but the Blade readers\ncannot hear them all

that it gives a plausibl\nexcuse to every criminal that ever\ndisgraced humanity According I\nto the doctrine of fatalism ther\nis no responsibility attached to\nthe criminal for any crime he may\ncommit hence there can be no\njustice in punishment\nWhat kind of government tould\nwe have if every judge jurymai\nand lawmaker were fatalists\nWould we have any government\nHow could a judge justly impose\na punishment on a criminal when\nhe could not help committing\ncrime Y\ncrimeI\nI object to some of his ground\nwork of facts because they\nare mere assumptions and con\ntrary to the facts He sees Goth\ning in Nature but matter und\nforce working under blind immu\ntable laws without PLAN or\nPURPOSE for nature has never\ndone anything but build up und\ntear down If he can see no pur\npose in Nature it is because he is\nmentally blind Let me illustrate\nA poet was journeying througl\nsome beautiful hill country His\nsoul was filled with delight at\nthe gorgeous colorings of early\nSpring Being thirsty he stopped\nat a farm house on a hillside Ai\nhe drank the welcome draught\nhe remarked to the master of the\nhouse about the beautiful coun\ntry round about What was his\ndismay when the countryman\nspoke with disgust Cant set\nnothing beautiful about this\nnever could raise any corn or\nthese hills The countryman\nwas blind to the beauties of Na\nture and could see nothing but\ncorn and hogs\nIs there no plan or purpose in\nNature Let us see Why dc\nyou love honor or respect youi\nmother Was it not because you\nowe to her your birth training\nand culture that has madde you i\nwhat you are Y What is it thai\ncauses the mother to work plar\nand provide for her offspring\nIs it not her nature that causes\nher to so doY\nThe forces of Nature pump\nmans breath and blood independ\nent of his will digest his food\netc Can we see no purpose\nwhy Nature should cause the\nblood to circulate the food to di\nvest etc Y\nWill power is nothing but the\nrtrength of desires he says I\nleny that assertion I know thai\nI can will and do directly contra\nry to all my desires and even my\nbest judgment if I choose Every\nredeemed sinner or reformed\ndrunkard has willed and acted\ndirectly in opposition to all his\nsinful desires or corrupt appetite\nHe says Nature has never\nlone anything but build up and\near down He has evidently\nlever studied evolution or the\nurvival of the fittest to any\npurpose or we would not say\nthat Is not every death tear\ning down succeeded by a life\nrebuild somewhat better than\nthe former life Y Does not the\ntudy of evolution go to prove\nhat man in his present highly\ndeveloped state owes all that he\nx to countless millions of living\nicings before him\nI freely admit that we are the\ncreatures of circumstances or\nenvironment more or less but\nthese circumstances or environ\nments have ever been such in the\nmain as to gradually advance\nman from the lowest order of life\nup to the high position he now\nholds in the order of creation\nNor does Nature stop here we\nare ever advancing to still more\nperfect beings and who can tell\nwhat the end will beY\nbeA\nA E

Elizabeths court not only\nin letters but in doctrine a Pa\nganism of the North always ser\nious generally sombre but which\nwas based like that of the SouthI\non natural forces\nIn some men all Christianity\nhad passed away j many proceed\ned to Atheism through excess of\nrebellion and debauchery like\nMarlowe and Greene With oUt\ners like Shakespeare the idea of\nGod scarcely makes its appear\nance they see in our poor human\nlife only a dream and beyond it\nthe long sad sleep\nFor them death is the goal of\nlife at most a dark gulf into\nwhich man plunges uncertain of\nthe issue If they carry their\ngaze beyond they perceive not\nthe spiritual soul welcomed into\na purer world but the corpse\nabandoned to the dadmp earth\nor the ghost hovering about the\nchurchyardThey like skeptics or\nsupersttious men never as true\nbelievers Their heroes have hu\nmannot religious virtues against\ncrime they rely on honor and the\nlove of the beautiful not on piety\nand the fear of God\nAbout thirty years ago I was\nconversing with Gen D W Wild\ner the wellknown western author\nand journalist a brother of Alex\nander Wilder on Shakespeares\nbelief I referred to this passage\nin Taine General Wilder was\nthen editor of the St Joseph Her\nald and soon after published an\narticle on Shakespeares belief\nquoting Taines testimony Re\nferring to our conversation and\nTaines testimony he said\nThe passage is a remarkable\none we had overlooked it in our\nreading of Taine This\nreminds us that some years ago\nwe asked Colonel Ingersoll if he\nwas an infidel not supposing he\nwas and knowing how often men\nwho do not agree with us are so\ncalled But he instantly replied\nI am and so was Shakespeare\nand he went to citing death\nscenes and other passages from\nthe great dramas An no doubt\nhe remembered this passage from\nTaine Shakespeare and Ingersoll two\nof the worlds immortals two of\nthe greatest masters of tho En\nglish tongueEnglands and\nAmericas greatest poets were\nboth InfidelsAgnostics\nToday I opened my Shake\nspeare In it for nearly a score\nof years has reposed a sheet of\npaper bearing in Col Ingersolls\nown handwriting the following\nwellknown tribute to Avons\nbardShakespeare was an intellect\nual ocean toward which all rivers\nran and from which now the isles\nand continents of thought receive\ntheir dew and rain\nThe history of this relic is as\nfollows On Sunday March 1\n1891 Colonel Ingersoll delivered\nfor the first time at Albany N\nY his now famous lecture on\nShakespeare The same day I\nspoke at Glens Falls Monday\nmorning I took a train for New\nYork and was joined at Albany\nby Colonel Ingersoll I had pro\ncured the Albany papers at Sara\ntoga These contained reports of\nhis lecture The peroration had\nevidently been butchered by the\nreporters and I called Col Inger\nsolls attention to it on tile way\ndown Ho took a sheet of paper\nwrote the passage as he had de\nlivered it and handed it to me\nThis was probably the first and\nis probably the only autograph\ncopy of these immortal words for\nthey were originally dictated to\nhis stenographer\nstenographerTHFiUNFORTUNATE\nTHE UNFORTUNATE\nGod gave her a lapfu
