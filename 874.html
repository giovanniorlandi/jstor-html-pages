His son was tho apple of hl3 eye.\nand now he was seeing him form em\nj bryonio afllllatlons with tho people of\nhis enemy.\nYoung Milt had visited Dawn; he\nhad watched with Anso Havey. The\nfather had always taken a natural\n\' pride in the honesty that gleamed\n\' from his son\'s alert eyes, and tho one\nI pereon from whom ho had concealed\nhis own ways of guilo and deceit most\n! studiously was the lad who would\ni somo day be lender In his stead. There\n\' were few things that this old Intriguer\n1 feared, but one there was, and now It\n, was tracing lines of care and anxiety\nin tho visage that had always been so\nmasklike and imperturbable. If his\nson bhould ever look past his outward\nself and catch a gltmpso of the inner\nman, the father knew that he would\nnot be able to sustain the scorn of\nthose younger eyes. So. whllo the\nlad, who had gono back to college In\nLexington, conned his books, his fath\ner sat before the blaze of his hearth,\nhis pipe tight clamped between his\nteeth, his heart festering In his breast,\naud his mind dangerously active.\nThe beginnings of all the things\nwhich he deplored, and meant to pun\nish, went back to the establishment of\na school with a "fotchedon" teacher.\nHad Dawn McNash not come there,\nhis boy\'s feet would not havo gone\nwondering westward over tho rldgo,\nstraying out of partlzun paths, Thu\nsllmness of her body, tho lure of her i\nviolet eyes, and tho dusky meshes of .\nher dark hair had led his own son to\nguard tho roof that sheltered her i\nagainst tho band of arson tho father\nhad hired.

Frank Hawn.\nStartling Announcement.\nOne afternoon, jii3t as a Provi\ndence clergyman was about to\nenter the pulpit to conduct the\nservice, a couple from a near-by\ntown presented themselves,\nmaking known their anxiety to\nbe married as quickly as possible.\nThe clergyman, whom the Bos\nton Globe calls an extremely\nmethodical man, replied that he\ncoald not oblige at that moment,\ni but that immediately upon the\nconclusion of the service he\nwould take pleasure in making\nthem man and wife.\nSo aftr srme e\'emurring, the\ncouple seated themselves in the\nrear of the church. When the\nminister had finished his remarks\nhe cleared his throat and made\nthe following announcement:\nThe parties who are to be\nJoined in matrimony will present\nthemselves at the chancel immed\niately after the singing of hymn\n423, \'Mistaken Souls That Dream\nof Heaven." Exchange.\nA Staggering Manifesto.\nIt must be staggering to even\nthe staid people of Great Britain.\nIt comes in the shape of a man-i\nifesto issued by the bankers of .\nGreat Britain.\nDuring the current year the\nBritish government has spent\n30,300,000,000. The statement\nis made that the government\nnext year mu&t spend $9,000,000,\n000. Advice follows, given in\nlanguage peremptory. The Brit\nish people must cut off the man\nufacture and use of nonessentials,\nnothing that costs must be ex\npected that the people cam poss\nibly get along without. The-\ni nvmvisn nf nmnnmv mnor\nof oconomv must bei\nuniversal and get right down to,\nhard pan.\nThe Britis\'i people arc told\nthat the task cf raising this en\normous amount of money, the.\ngreater part of it, must devolve\nupon them. These are some of\nthings told the British people in\na very cold-blooded sort of man\nner by the bankers.\nIt shows determination. It\nshows that the British authorities\nlook upon the situation as desper-\nate. aud that victory must be had\nprepared to make his roar heard\nall along the battle lines. Money,\nmunitions and men are essential,\nnothing that can be done will be\nleft undone to make tho British\nhand felt by the foe,\nISIfefMM J.
