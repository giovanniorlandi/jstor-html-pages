VOL. 34 NO. 1.\nTH[y SEE THE WORLD\nTHROUGH BABY\'S EYES\nOnly Member of Family Who Can\nTell of This World\'s\nBeauties.\nCOLORADO SPRING\'S,\nIn a little home at Lake George, 25\nmiles from here, there is a baby boy,\n?who, when he grows up, will be able\nto tell his father, his mother and a\nbrother and sister, of the beauties\nof the mountain region in which they\nlive, but. which have been shut out\nto them throughout their lives.\nThis baby, the pride and wonder\nof the entire district possesses the\nblessing of sight, denied all other\nmembers of the family. The baby\'s\nfather is Benjamin Richards. He is\nblind. The little mother now the\nhappiest woman in all Colorado, was\nMiss Myrtle Higbv. She was born\nblind. She was\' a student in the\nState School for the Blind and while\nthere met Richards. His sight had\nbeen destroyed in an accident.\nDrawn together by their afflction\nwhich sent them through the world\nin darkness. Richard and the little\nblind girl were married. Five years\nago a baby girl was born. Anxiously,\nthey waited for the word that would\ntell them whether the innocent little\nnewcomer had also entered the world\nin darkness. Their hearts were torn\nwhen they were told the baby girl\nwould never see. Three years later\na babv boy arrived and he, too had\nbeen denied the gift of sight.\nTwo years passed, a littla gin,\nnow five years old, played in a world\nof darkness about her mother who\nhad also never seen the light of day.\nA little boy groped about the floor,\nhis sightless eyes turning toward the\nmother when he knew only by the\nsound of her voice, or the touch of\nlove from her hand. It was a home\nof darkness; father and mother un\nable to iook upon their children and\nthe little ones growing and blossom\ning despite the blight cast upon them\nat birth. But neighbors told mother\nRichard that her little ones were\npretty children and she smiled and\ncoddled the little hands and faces\nshe could not see.\nTime went on. As mother Richards\nheard the voices of her two little\nones as they played in the darkness\nof their baby lives, she knew that\nthe great, good bird, the stork, woulu\nsoon hover over her home again. She\nknew that he was about to bring\nanother baby soul into the world,\nand mother Richards prayed that this\ninnocent might be spared the blight\nof eternal darkness. Mother Rich\nards was cheerful and hopeful, but\nwhen the time came for father Rich\nards to summon the village doctor,\nhis heart fairly stood still.\nSome friends accompanied the\nman of medicine to the Richards\nhome. They knew of the prayer of\nthe mother and father and of their\nhope. The doctor could only tell\nthem that he hoped, but there was\npre-natal influence to be overcome.\nBefore him was a sightless mother,\nwaiting with the mountain friends\nwas the sightless father and the chil\ndren of night. The doctor came from\nthe room. His face was wreathed\nin smiles. He grasped father Rich\nards by the hand.\n"A boy; seven and one-half pounds\n?and perfect eyes. He sees," the\nbig man told the father even as he\nhimself was almost overcome with\nemotion.\nThere were tears of joy in the Rich\nards home that day. Though they\ndid not know just why, thee hildish\nlaughs of the little ones of darkness\ncarried a new note of cheer and hop**.\nCANADIANS ADVERTISE\nEXCURSION TO GERMANY\nREGINA, Sask., March 2.?Posters\nannouncing the assembling of the\nthird Canadian expeditionary force to\nbe sent to the war, on exhibition hero\ntoday, show the lightheadedness of\nthe Canadians. The wording is:\nTO BERLIN\nThe country is arranging a trip to\nGermany, in the spring for a few\nSPORTSMEN.\nAll hotel expenses and railway fares\npaid.\nGood shooting and hunting.\nAges?18 to 38.\nRifles and ammunition supplied\nfree.\nCheap trips to the "Rhine.\nApply at once, as there will he\nonly a limited nuimber (one million)\nadmitted.\nTRADE INDUSTRY\nIncreased Imports of Raw Materials\nand Rapid Growth in Domestic\nManufacture.\nThe silk manufacturers of the Utoited\nStates in the 35 years since 1880 have\nincreased the value of their output\nfrom $41,000,000 to upwards of $200,\n000,000, have consumed in that time\nabout 45 (million pounds of raw mater\nial, and have increased their propor\ntion of the domestic consumption of\nsilk goods from a little over one-half\nthe total in 1880 to more than four\nfifths in 1910, the latest year covered\nby the reports of the government.\nThe fiscal year 1914 surpassed all\nprevious years in the quantity of raw\nsilk imported into this country, the\ntotal for that year, according to the\nfigures of the bureau of foreign and\ndomestic commerce, department of\ncommerce, being 34 1-2 million pounds,\nagainst 32 million in 1913, 13 (million\nin 1900, 2 1-2 million in 1880 and a\nhalf million in 1870,\nThis rapid growth in imports of\nraw silk is reflected in the rapid ex\npansion in the product of domestic\nsilk manufacturing establishments,\nthe value thereof rising steadily from\n12 million dollars in 1870 to 41 mil\nlion in 1880, 87 million in 1890, 107\nmillion in 1900, and 197 million in\n1910. The-importation of silk (manu\nfactures has been conversely affect\ned and the value of silk goods im\nported last year, $35,455,000, is less\nthan the total recorded 30 years ago,\nand substantially the same as that o:\n60 years ago.\nJapan supplies a large and increa*\ning proportion of the raw silk cor\nsumed in American factories. Te?\nyears ago she furnished more thai\nhalf of the total, while last year lie*\nshare was nearly three-fourths. Oi\nthe 12,631,000 pounds of raw silk im\nported in 1904, 6,691,000 pounds were\nfrom Japan, 3,385,000 from China, and\n2,095,000 from Italy. In 1914 there\nwere imported 28 1-2 million pounds\nof raw silk in skeins reeled from the\ncocoon or rereeled, exclusive of\nwaste, and of this amount Japan\'s\nshare was 20,196,000 pounds, against\n5,927,000 from China, and 1,997,000\nfrom Italy. It is interesting to note\nthat a considerable part of this in\ncreased Importation of raw sflk from\nJapan is paid for by American cotton.\nIn 1904 we exported to Japan 23 mil\nlion pounds of raw cotton and in\n1914 nearly 177 million pounds.\nOf the 35 1-2 million dollars\' worth\nof silk manufactures imported in the\nlast fiscal year $12,232,000 worth, or\nimore than one-third, consisted of fab\nrics woven in the piece; $5,752,000\nspun silk or schapp eyarn; $4,246,\n000 wearing apparel; $4,351,000 laces\nend about $3,000,000 each consisted\nof ribbons, and of plushes, velvets,\nand other pile fabrics. In addition\nover $4,000,000 worth of artificial alike,\nmostly yarns and threads, for use in\ndomestic factories, were imported.\nFrance supplied over one-half, Ja\npan one-fourth, and Switzerland one\neighth of the silk fabrics Imported.\nOf the silk laces and embroideries\nimported France furnished over three\nfourth?. Of the plushes and velvets\nimported we bought $1,712,000 from\nFrance and $1,056,000 from Germany\nout of a total of $3,205,000 last year.\nSwitzerland ranks next to France in\nthe supply of ribbons, their respec\ntive shares being $1,136,000 and $1,\n830,000 out of a total of $3,112,000.\nThe silk clothing imported into the\nUnited States is largely from France,\nimports therefrom totaling $2,848,000,\nas compared with less than a half\nmillion dollars\' worth from England or\nJapan, a quarter million from Ger\nmany, and about $109,000 from Swit\nzerland.\nThe customs revenues on imported\nsilk manufactures in the fiscal year\n1914 aggregated $16,704,000, equiva\nlent to 48 per cent ad ralorem,\nagainst $13,988,000, or 52 per cent ad\nvalorem in 1913. Under the present\ntariff law the rich man\'s silks cost\nhijm more and the poor man\'s silks\ncost him less than formerly. The\nlaw changed the rate of duty from $3\nper pound and upward on silk goods\nto 45 per cent ad valorem. Thus a\n32-ounce bolt of silk containing, say\n20 yards, and worth $2 at the foreign\nport of shipment, which formerly\npaid $6 duty, now pays only 90 cents.\nThe perversity of human nature is\nfound in the fact that a chronic\ndyspeptic, placed in the war zone,\nwould work up a pork and beans ap\npetite in f*\'o wiinutes.?Washington\nPost.\nNEARLY A BILLION\nIN PHONE HI\nFigures for 1912 Give $991,000,000 In\nvested in Main Concerns Bur\nleson Would Take Over.\nPostmaster General Burleson\'s pro\nposal that the government take over\nthe ownership of telegraph and tele\nphone companies and operate them\nmake especially interesting statistics\nof them, soon to be published by Di\nrector William J. Harris, of the b.i\nreau of tli i censjs, department tf\ncommerce.\nThe figures relato to 1912 and, for\ntelephone concerns, are for compan\nies having yearly Incomes of $5,000\nor more.\nAccording to the report, the capi\ntalization of such telephone com\npanies increased from $758,000,000 in\n1907 to $991,000,000 in 1912, or by\nj more than 110 per cent. During the\nsame time the capitalization of tele\ngraph companies decreased from\n$263,000,000 to $232,000,000 or ap\nproximately 8 per .cent. Tthtfs de\ncrease, however, was due entirely to\na reduction of $23,?00,0000 iu the cap\nitalization of wireless telegraph com\npanies. Outside of these, an increase\nin (capitalization of $2,200,000, or\nabout 1 per cent, is shown.\nThe net income of the telephone\n000 in 1907 to $51,300,000 in 1912,\nwhile the net income of the tele\ngraph companies decrease from $9,\n650,000 to $6,400,000.\nThe \'number of employes reported\nby the telephone companies increas\ned from approximately 131,000 in 1907\nto 183,000 in 1912, While the number\nof telegraph employes rose from\n28,000 to 38,000.\nThese telephone companies, oper\nating 84 per cent of the instruments,\nreported 13,375,000,000 calls in 1912,\nagainst 10,400,000,000 In 1907. Tele\ngraph messages increased from 103,\n949,000 in 1907 to 109,663,000 in 1912.\nIn 1912 there were 20,000,000 miles of\ntelephlne wires in use.\nc. The Bell telephone system in 1912\ncontrolled nearly 75 per cent of the\ntotal wire mileage and over 58 per\nc<?nt of the total number of tele\nphones. It also controlled nearly 51\nper cent of the public exchanges and\nhandled 66 1-2 per cent of the calls.\nThe wire mileage of the Bell system\nincreased from 8,947,000 in 1907 to\n15,133,000 in 1912, or by more than 69\nper cent. During the same time the\nwire mileage of all other systems\ncombined increased from 4,052,000 to\n5,115,000, or by a little over 26 per\ncent.\nThe total number of telephones in\nuse (exclusive of railway, govern\nmental or private telephones not con\nnected with public exchanges) in\ncreased from 6,118,000 in 1907 to\n8,730,000 in 1912.\nThe development of independent\nrural telephone systems is indicated\nby the faut that the total number of\nsystems or lines increased from 22,\n971 in 1907 to 32,223 in 1912.\nSURPRISE TESTS\nMany Enginemen are Identifying\nThemselves With Movement\nAgainst Them\nMany enginemen running on rail- j\nroads operating In this district are\nidentifying themselves with the move\nment having for its object the elimina\ntion of the so-called "surprise" tests\nto which imany claim they are sub\njected, and which they say instead of\nmaking them efficient in safety, has\nthe opposite effect. The surprise tests\nconsists of making a sudden and un\nexpected display of danger signals by\nrepresentatives of the operating de\npartment in order to determine wheth\ner enginemen are on the alert ail the\ntime. The engineers and firemen as\nsert that the nervous shocks exper\nienced by them when so surprised is\ndetrimental to their health, declaring\nthat the tests are not needed for the\nsafety of their own Jives prompts\nthen to be constantly on the lookout\nfor any danger which may suddenly\nar.d unexpectedly appear.\nC)rt engineer on a local road tans\neited < ne case whicn was brought out\nin the controversy in the western\nTHEIR OWN HOMES\nAnd In Some Instance# They Own\nAutomobiles?Many Thrifty\nMen.\nIn these days when the high ccst\nof living makes the average trades\nman or laborer huntie for a living for\nhimself and family, and real luxuries\nare not considered, it is interesting\nto note that in a mining town in the\nNew River field of West Virginia,\nthere are several coal miners who\nown automobiles, and good ones, too,\nand get as much pleasure out of\nthem as the capitalist in bitf six\ncylinder. The fact that they have\nbeen able to buy them la uot surpris\ning, for when conditions are normal\nthey can make more money digging\ncoal than many college graduates\nearn in their offices, and who could\nnot dream of the luxury of an au\ntomobile.\nAnd in this same town Are a num\nber of coal miners who own their\nown homes?men who have worked\nfor good wages where livLng is\nnot excessively high, and are the\nproud possessors of comfortable\nhomes or tl;?ir families.\nAnd a visit to the bank in this\nsame town, where all the residents\nmake their living directly or indi\nrectly from the mines, disclosed tho\nindustrial depositors In the Savings\nDepartment, one Italian miner head\ning the list with $3,000 to his credit,\nand many others with accounts run\nning into four figures. A number\nof th<\\se men could buy automobiles\nif they wanted them. On the street\na husky colored miner* was asked\nto tell the most he had ever made\nin one month in the mines, and his\nreply was, $327.82, out ot which he\npaid his helper at the rate of $2.GO\na day. The truth of this statement\nwas vouched for by the mine man\nager.\nThese facts give weight. to the\nclaim that of all classes of workmen\nthe West VirginlaC coal miner lias\nthe best opportunity to earn good\nwages, and save if he wants to.\nThe Czar must wonder where all\nthose Russian come from that the\nGermans capture.?New York World.\nrate case in whicli an engineer and\nfireman were suddenly confronted by\ndanger signals while running at high\nspeed. The engineer threw on the re-;\nverse brakes and he with the fireman\njumped, and as a result sustained a\nfractured collar bone and other seri\nous injuries. He said that there are\nmany engineers who would do the\nsame thing if the signals were flashed\non them under the same conditions\nand th0 shock which they receive is\neven worse than bodily injuries, as it\nis sometimes weeks and months be\nfore they get over the effects and in\na few cases it has been known to\nruin good engineers forever.\nThe railroads on their part claim\nthat the surprise tests are productive\nof much good, but the local engineer\nclaims that they have failed so far to\nshow in figures during the controver\nsy where it. has at any time been of\nbenefit, while the engineers have prov\nen that, not one wreck in a given\nnumber was caused by the disregard\nof signals.\nQueen Wilhelrnina has been asked\ntoy the International Peace Commit\ntee of Amsterdam, through a much\nsigned petition. to offer mediation to\nthe belligerent nations.

We have millions of dol\nlars invested where the owners of the\njitney buses have but thousands. We\nwant the jitney bus operator to come\nunder the regulations of the state\nrailroad commission. The street rail\nway companies have opened up scores\nof suburbs by extending their lines !\nand wo think we should be afforded\nsom0 protection." i\nMore than 1,000 jitneys are operat\ning in Los Angeles. Everywhere the\natreet car companies are laying off\nfound, too. In San Francisco, Port\nland, Seattle and Los Angeles, the\nstreet car companies ar laying off\nemployes and these men are buying\nautounobiles on the installment plan\nand operating them as jitney buses.\nJn discussing the jitney bus situa\ntion in Seattle recently, Miayor Hiram\nGill said: "It will1 surprise me great\nly if another foot of street car track\nis ever laid in Seattle. In my opinion\nniotor-.propelled vehicles are as logi\ncally the successor to the electric car\nas the electric car was the logical suc\ncessor of horse-drawn vehicles."\nAutobus owners and drivers in Smi\nFrancisco have organized the Jitney\nBus Association, have engaged a legal\nstaff, and are prepared to fight auy\nattempt to legislate them out of bus\niness.\nIn Pueblo.\nUUEBLiO, Colo., ?Jitney\nbuses are now operating full blast in\nPueblo. They are in open competi\ntion with the street cars and doing a\nbig business. In fact so serious have\nthe jitneys become, from the stand\npoint of street car men, that a dele\ngation of employes of the Tramway\nCompany appealed to the city com\nmissioners to put the jitneys out of\nbusiness. Tho commissioners have\nlooked the ground over, however, and\nare of the opinion that it can\'t be\ndone.\nThe concern of motormen and con\nductors employed by the street car\ncompany is due to the fact that they\ndeclare the company officials have re\nduced tho number of cars being run on\nmany lines and their chances of hav\ning steady employment are ruined.\nThe reduction \'in the car service has\nresulted in many tmen being thrown\nout of work.\nKansas City.\nKANSAS CITY, Mto., -Its a\nlong face the taxi cab chauffeur here\nwears these days. Fares are few and\nlong between and it\'s all the fault of\nthe jitney buses which go most any\nwhere in Kansas City now within a\ntwo miles radius for a nickel fare.\nThe taxis have been hit the ardest\nat their stand at the union station.\nThe "nickel chasers" get most of the\nbusiness, makin ga loop from the sta\ntion to all the hotels and charging\nonly a five cent fare. One traveling\nman was arrested recently because\nihe refused to pay a taxi charge of\n$1.10 from on? of the hotels to the de\npot on the ground that it was exhorb\nltant. The company said that $1.10\nwas the regular rate, and he was Ha\nfed.\nHe made the next trip in an auto\nfor a nickel and declared he would\npreach "jitney buses" clear across the\ncountry.\nJitneys gr?w in Kansas City despite\nthe most adverse weather conditions\nand the hills.\nSo far no regulations have been ai>\npiied to the Jitueys other than the\ntraffic rules\n119,000 HEAD OF\nSB DESTROYED\nFoot-and-Mou+h Disease Caused a\nHeavy Loss Throughout the\nCountry\nTo date the foot and mouth dis- !\nease among cattle has claimed 111),\n000 victims in iiie United States.\nThis number includes those which i\nhave died with lue disease and those 1\nwhich have been slaughtered by gov\nernment inspectors. Of the individual\nstates Illinois suffered the worst, los\ning ov*r 50.U00 head with 30 affect\ned herds yet to be slaughtered.\nAccording to Dr. C. L. Hall, of\nUnited States bureau of animal in\ndustry, wtio furnished these ligures,\nconditions are now slightly better\nthan they were a week ago. The\nlOast St. Louis, Cincinnati and in- j\ndianapolis stock yards have just been !\nreopened. These yards were closed\ntogether with all other yards of im\nportance in the country when the\nrecent new outbreaw starteled the\ncountry.\nThe tremendous slaughter of cat\ntle to prevent the spread of the dis\nease is expected by Dr. Hall to ser\niously curtail the meat supply in the\nUnited States for the next two years,\neven if the disease is cleaned up\nshortly. Many of the animals killed i\nwere calves and breeding stock which i\nwill leave a great shortage next year.\nThen, too, farmers will probably be\nafraid to restock at once on account\nof the disease.\nHEAVIER TRAVEL\nOF IMMIGRANTS\nAfter a lull in immigrant travel\nthrough the local terminal of more\nthan four months, it was announced\nthis morning that all the through\ntrains arriving in this city from the\neast and north are carrying many im\nmigrants to settle in this state and in\nother states further west.\nHundreds of Germans as well as\nAustrians that have been residing in\nCanada are coming into this country\nevery day and settling here as fast\nas they can dispose of their farm? and\nother possessions in the Doiminion.\nWhile the Germans have been treated\nwell in the Dominion, they are leaving\nto settle here, many being booked for\nthis state through agents that are get>\nting them to take up land in Wont\nVirginia..\nJ.

Francis, of Missouri, once said the fol\nlowing1 of newspapers: "Each year the locai paper gives from\n$500 to $1,000 in free lines to the community in which it is lo\ncated. No other agency can or will do this. The editor, in pro\nportion to his means, does more for his town than any ten men\nand in fairness he ought to be supported not because you like\nhim or admire his writings but because the local paper is the\nbest investment a community can make. It may not be brilliant\nly edited or crowded with thought, but finally it is of more benefit\nthe community than the preacher or teacher.
