        <pre>['Current History\nDECEMBER, 1971 VOL. 61, NO. 364\nIn  this issue, seven articles consider the nations of Southeast Asia and \nthe impact of United States policies there. Evaluating the effects of the \nN ixon Doctrine on insular Southeast Asia and on mainland Southeast Asia, \nour introductory author concludes that “The Nixon Doctrine—in its ap\xad\nplication to other parts of Asia and the world as well as to Southeast Asia— \nmay turn out to be one of the most valuable shifts in United States foreign \npolicy in several decades."\nThe Nixon Doctrine in Southeast Asia\nB y  R ic h a r d  B u t w e l l\nProfessor of Political Science, State University of New York College at Brockport\nT\nh e  A merican  ro le  in Southeast Asia \nhas not changed dramatically as a \nresult of the Nixon Doctrine. The \npreliminary outline of the new policy was re\xad\nvealed on Guam in July, 1969,1 when Pres\xad\nident Richard M. Nixon was en route to \nmeetings with leaders of the Philippines, \nThailand and Indonesia. The number of \nAmerican fighting men in Vietnam has de\xad\ncreased by nearly two-thirds in the two years \nsince the President signaled a reduced mili\xad\ntary role for the United States in the area. \nBut the United States still plays a key role in \nsupport of the anti-Communist South Viet\xad\nnamese regime; it has become a major prop \nof the Cambodian government of Lon Nol; \nand it has enlarged its participation in the \nwar in Laos since 1969,\n1 “Excerpts from Unofficial Account of Presi\xad\ndent Nixon’s Meeting with Reporters,” The New \nYork Times, July 26, 1969. The President’s first \naddress on the subject—over radio and television \n—was made on November 3, 1969. See Depart\xad\nment of State Bulletin, November 24, 1969, for the \ntext of this talk.\nThe American commitment to Thailand, \nembodied in the 1954 Manila Treaty and in \na 1962 United States-Thai bilateralization of \nth ir SEATO defense relationship, has not \nb en altered. United States forces, mainly \nairmen engaged in the air war over Vietnam \nand Laos, have been reduced nearly 40 per \ncent, and United States aid to the Thai has \ndropped since President Nixon’s Guam press \nconference. But the United States is still \nThailand’s number one ally, her chief source \nof foreign assistance and, possibly more than \never before, the Bangkok government’s main \nhope that the Communist wars afflicting \nneighboring Laos and Cambodia will not spill \nover into Thailand.\nThe United States has agreed to give up \na lesser naval facility in the Philippines, but \nFilipino military dependence on the United \nStates and the United States defense com\xad\nmitment to the Philippines have not lessened. \nAs for those other Southeast Asian countries \nwith whom United States military ties were \nwholly or practically nonexistent during most\n', '322 •  CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1971\nof the 1960’s, there has been no change either \n—except for United States military assistance \nto Indonesia (inaugurated since the replace\xad\nment of the United States-baiting President \nSukarno by soldier-politician President \nSuharto).\nThe limited change in the United States \nrole in Southeast Asia is surprising in light of \nthe interpretation initially placed by the re\xad\ngion’s leaders on President Nixon’s proclaimed \nintention to redirect the emphasis of United \nStates relations with friendly Asian lands. \nThe belief was widespread in the area that \nthe United States had had its fill of war in \nVietnam and that, disillusioned with the \ncost and limited success of that effort, the \nUnited States was leaving Asia altogether.2\nThe Nixon Doctrine itself was not un\xad\npalatable to key Southeast Asian leaders. \nIndonesia has long been an advocate of a \nlessened foreign role in the area and greeted \nthe new Nixon approach as a vindication of \nher own position. Other Southeast Asian \ngovernments, however, feared that the United \nStates would go beyond the sketchy formula \nfor a changed relationship initially outlined \nby President Nixon. The new American re\xad\nlationship with Southeast Asia, it was widely \nbelieved, would be shaped on the campuses\n2 A most illuminating and thorough study of \nthe different kinds of costs of the Vietnam war is \nto be found in Impact of the Vietnam War, pre\xad\npared for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nby the Congressional Research Service of the Li\xad\nbrary of Congress (Washington, D.C.: Government \nPrinting Office, 1971).\n3 For a clear statement of Southeast Asian fears, \nsee the article by former Assistant Secretary of \nState for East Asian and Western Pacific Affairs \nWilliam P. Bundy, “New Tides in Southeast Asia,” \nForeign Affairs, January, 1971, p. 305.\n4 With regard to the domestic roots of the Nixon \npolicies, see Stephen S. Rosenfeld, “The Nixon \nDoctrine—A Domestic Success,” in the Washing\xad\nton Post, December 4, 1970.\n8 The reader may wish to compare the Nixon \nDoctrine as it is evolving with the earlier views \nof the President in Richard M. Nixon, “Asia After \nVietnam,” Foreign Affairs, October, 1967.\n6 For an interesting review of these agreements \nin light of Nixon’s 1969-1971 East Asia policies, \nsee Earl C. Ravenal, “The Nixon Doctrine and \nOur Asian Commitments,” Foreign Affairs, Jan\xad\nuary, 1971, pp. 255-271.\n7 Both messages were titled United States Foreign \nPolicy for the 1970’s. They were delivered to the \nCongress on February 18, 1970, and February 25, \n1971, respectively, and are available from the \nGovernment Printing Office, Washington, D.C.\nand streets of the United States—not in a \nrational response to the problems of the \nSoutheast Asian nations and the threat to \ntheir continued independence.3\nA  LESSENED MILITARY ROLE\nThe domestic impact on the administra\xad\ntion’s foreign policies cannot be ignored, par\xad\nticularly in light of the forced resignation \nfrom political leadership of President Lyndon \nJohnson in 1968. But the roots of the Nixon \nDoctrine are deeper than a response to the \nrealities of public opinion at home.4 In No\xad\nvember, 1967, when President Johnson and \nhis policies still seemed unassailable, the \nnot-yet-President Nixon wrote in Foreign \nAffairs that the countries of Asia must bear \ngreater responsibility for their defense.5 6\nThe Nixon point of view, as it turned out, \nrepresented also a growing trend within the \nforeign affairs bureaucracy and, when Nixon \nbecame President, he found perhaps unex\xad\npected agreement with his line of thought \namong the professionals who carry the burden \nof the nation’s foreign policy. He found an\xad\nother point of view, too, probably not an\xad\nticipated : the belief, not especially widespread \nbut strongly held by key figures in the bureau\xad\ncracy, that the United States was unduly en\xad\ncumbered by the assortment of multilateral \nand bilateral security pacts brought into being \nwhen John Foster Dulles was Secretary of \nState. These agreements, designed to tie \ndown various other states as allies, were in\xad\ncreasingly viewed as tying down the United \nStates and limiting the flexibility of its foreign \npolicy.® The objective behind the Nixon \nDoctrine was disengagement—but disengage\xad\nment from a particular role in Asia, not dis\xad\nengagement from Asia altogether.\nThe Nixon Doctrine has taken on the \ncharacter of a major set of foreign policy \nguidelines since its initial exposition in 1969. \nIn two foreign policy messages to the Con\xad\ngress,7 the President emphasized the impor\xad\ntance of increased self-reliance on the part \nof Asian nations. He also stated repeatedly \nthat the United States would not again be\xad\ncome engaged in a Vietnam-type war. The \nUnited States, according to the President, will\n', 'The Nixon Doctrine • 323\nhonor existing treaty commitments, but it \nwill not enter into any new such relation\xad\nships.8 9 President Nixon has also said that \nthe United States will continue to provide a \n“shield” against nuclear attack, presumably \nfrom China, but his efforts to come to an \nunderstanding with Peking suggest that he \ndoes not visualize the necessity of honoring \nthis pledge.\nPresident Nixon initially stated his govern\xad\nment’s willingness to provide increased aid to \nfriendly Asian countries to help them to de\xad\nvelop greater capability to stand on their own \nfeet. Congressional willingness to fund such \naid was open to question even at the time \nof the President’s July, 1969, remarks on \nGuam, however, and it has become even more \nproblematical subsequently—not least of all \nas a result of the United States’ mounting \ninternational economic difficulties.\nTHE MILITARY PULLBACK\nThe number of United States servicemen \nin Vietnam peaked at 543,400 in April, 1969, \nthree months before the unveiling of the \nNixon Doctrine. The disengagement of \nAmerican fighting men from Vietnam began \nin May of that year and declined to 184,000 \nby December, 1971. The cost of fighting the \nwar in Vietnam also fell from $28.8 billion \nannually in fiscal year 1969 to an estimated \n$15.3 billion in fiscal year 1971.®\nIt could be argued that the United States \nwas also disengaging from Vietnam in another \nway. In the 1967 presidential elections in \nSouth Vietnam, the Johnson administration \nhad defended the voting as democratic. \nThere were American critics of the 1967 bal\xad\nloting, but there was no evidence of the kind \nof official displeasure that developed in 1971 \nwhen President Nguyen Van Thieu ran a \none-man race. Thieu is still South Vietnam’s\n8 “While pledging to honor all existing com\xad\nmitments,” Ravenal has written, “the President has \nplaced them all in considerable doubt.” See his \narticle, “The Nixon Doctrine and Our Asian Com\xad\nmitments,” p. 271.\n9 These figures are “budgeted war costs” as used \nin Impact of the Vietnam War (Washington, D.C.: \nGovernment Printing Office, 1971), p. 2. These \narc by no means all the costs involved in fighting \nthe war, however.\nleader in 1971 and the Nixon administration \nmust deal with him—but he is no longer the \nfavored leader that he was four years earlier.\nThe American disengagement from Viet\xad\nnam was accompanied by a reduction in \nUnited States military personnel in two near\xad\nby countries that played back-stopping roles \nin the war—Thailand and the Philippines. \nA United States-Thai agreement to reduce \nthe number of American forces in Thailand \nfollowed on the heels of President Nixon’s \n1969 visit to the country (and the displeasure \nthe Thai initially felt at what seemed to be a \nunilateral American pullout from the area). \nBy mid-1971, approximately 16,000 United \nStates servicemen (mostly airmen) had been \nwithdrawn from Thailand, leaving about \n30,000 American military personnel still in \nthe country.\nMost United States service personnel in \nthe Philippines have been located at the huge \nClark Air Force Base and the Subic Bay naval \nfacility. Philippine President Ferdinand \nMarcos had earlier asked for the return of a \nthird base, the Sangley Point naval air sta\xad\ntion, but President Johnson refused his re\xad\nquest—claiming that the facility was essential \nto the conduct of the war in Vietnam. In \n1971, however, with United States participa\xad\ntion in the war declining, President Nixon re\xad\nsponded affirmatively to renewed overtures \nfor Sangley’s return. The total of American \nservicemen in the Philippines also declined \nunder the Nixon administration, dropping by \nabout 6,500 men through mid-1971 to \napproximately 18,500.\nThese pullbacks did not take place in a \nvacuum. During the same period, the United \nStates reduced the number of its servicemen \nin Japan (by approximately 12,000 men or \nabout one-third of the total when Richard \nNixon became President) and in Korea \n(down 20,000 by mid-1971 from 60,000 or so \ntroops in 1969). The United States also re\xad\nlinquished responsibility for patrolling any \nportion of the 151-mile-long northern border \nof South Korea and closed down several \nmilitary facilities in Japan—more quickly and \nwillingly than the Japanese expected. And \nthe Nixon administration gave in to Japan’s\n', '324 •  CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1971\ndemands for Okinawa’s return by 1972— \nagain with less resistance than anticipated.\nGROWING INVOLVEMENT\nThe surprising thing is not that the Nixon \nadministration made these moves but that the \nUnited States role as of late 1971 changed \nso little as a result. If the United States were \nin the process of reducing both its military \nand political support of South Vietnam, it \nwas at the same time more deeply involved in \nshoring up the regimes of neighboring Laos \nand Cambodia than it had been when Pres\xad\nident Nixon assumed office. I t might even be \nargued that the United States was more in\xad\nvolved in support of a particular faction in \nLaos in 1971—despite the Nixon Doctrine— \nthan it had been at the beginning of the \n1960’s, when it had endeavored to ensure \nthe continuation in power of General Phoumi \nNosavan.\nThe growing United States involvement in \nLaos resembled the incremental involvement \nof the Kennedy administration in Vietnam in \nthe early 1960’s and that of President John\xad\nson in the same country up to the great escala\xad\ntion of 1965 and the years immediately fol\xad\nlowing. Part of the strategy in Laos was to \nchoke the flow of men and supplies from \nNorth Vietnam through Laos to South Viet\xad\nnam. But the United States was also con\xad\ncerned with the struggle for power within \nLaos itself—not least of all as a function of \nits partnership with Thailand, which could be \nseriously threatened by the fall of adjacent\n10 According to presidential communications ad\xad\nviser Herbert Klein, in early 1971 there were “500 \nor 600 persons, both military or civilian, in Laos \n. . . attached to the royal government.” See the \nWashington Post, February 14, 1971. President \nNixon said in March, 1970, that there were 320 \nAmericans in Laos in “a military advisory or mil\xad\nitary training capacity.” For a good review of the \nNixon strategy in Laos, see Murrey Marder, “Low \nProfile Helped Nixon in Laos Test,” in the Wash\xad\nington Post, February 12, 1971.\n11 Secretary of State William P. Rogers admitted \nthis figure at a mid-1971 press conference ( Wash\xad\nington Star, June 15, 1971).\n12 A brief but good statement of the Nixon ad\xad\nministration’s justification of the Cambodian inter\xad\nvention can be found in the introductory remarks \nof Secretary of State William Rogers in United \nStates Foreign Policy 1969-1970, Department of \nState publication 8575 (March, 1971), p. 12.\nLaos to anti-Thai, pro-Communist Vietnam\xad\nese forces.\nBy 1971, there were several hundred United \nStates military personnel in Laos10—some of \nthem functioning in virtually combat roles \n(such as assisting Meo tribal elements against \nthe rebel Pathet Lao and their North Viet\xad\nnamese allies) —in addition to American units \nin neighboring Thailand which were flying \nair missions against Communist targets in \nLaos. The United States also was largely \nfinancing the operations of more than 5,000 \nThai military personnel operating within \nLaos. And United States economic assistance \nto the Laotian government totalled $350 mil\xad\nlion annually by 1971.11 The cost of United \nStates air operations in the Laotian war were \nestimated to approximate $1.4 billion.\nCAMPAIGN IN CAMBODIA\nThe United States did not even enjoy dip\xad\nlomatic relations with Cambodia when Pres\xad\nident Nixon took office. In June, 1969, agree\xad\nment was reached to restore diplomatic ties, \nbroken at Prince Norodom Sihanouk’s initia\xad\ntive in 1965. In March, 1970, Sihanouk was \noverthrown by domestic opponents and, with\xad\nin six weeks of this change of governments, \nUnited States and South Vietnamese forces \ncrossed over into Cambodia ostensibly to fa\xad\ncilitate the departure of United States military \npersonnel from Vietnam by reducing the \nthreat of attack against them from sanctuary \nareas in Cambodia.12\nAbout 32,000 United States troops par\xad\nticipated in the two-month-long Cambodian \ncampaign, which ended (whatever President \nNixon’s original intention) by the end of \nJune in response to the outcry against the \nmove in the United States. United States \nsupport of the new Cambodian regime did \nnot end with the departure of United States \nground forces, however. The United States \ncontinued to provide air support for both \nCambodian and South Vietnamese military \noperations in the country, and by 1971 the \nUnited States military aid program in Cam\xad\nbodia totalled $220 million annually (up from \n$185 million in 1970)—to which should be \nadded $110 million in economic assistance\n', 'The Nixon Doctrine • 325\n(an increase of more than 50 per cent over \nthe previous year).13 There had been no \nUnited States aid program of any kind in \nCambodia when Richard Nixon became \nPresident, but it was predicted that assistance \nto that country would top $1 billion by the \nend of 1972.14\nTWO SOUTHEAST ASIAS\nThe increasing United States involvement \nin Laos and Cambodia has taken place in \nspite of the Nixon Doctrine. Does this mean \nthat the Nixon Doctrine is not practical—at \nleast in the short run? Do United States \nactivities in Laos and Cambodia offset the \naccomplishments of partial military disen\xad\ngagement from Vietnam, Thailand and the \nPhilippines? Is the United States succeeding \nin transforming its role in Southeast Asia, or \nhas it merely shifted the battlefields?\nFor too many years—for too many Ameri\xad\ncans—Vietnam was synonymous with South\xad\neast Asia. It would be no less a mistake to \njudge the impact of the Nixon Doctrine pri\xad\nmarily in terms of Laos and Cambodia, for \nthey are no more synonymous with Southeast \nAsia today than was Vietnam in 1966.\nThe fact is that there may not be a single \nregion which should be regarded as South\xad\neast Asia. The countries of insular Southeast \nAsia differ sufficiently from those of the main\xad\nland to raise serious doubts about the utility \nof thinking in terms of one Southeast Asia. \nIt may be more realistic to talk of two South\xad\neast Asias—the insular and the mainland \ncountries, respectively.\nThe Nixon Doctrine has seemed almost \nideally conceived to Indonesia’s leadership. \nIts emphasis on a reduced role for a major \nforeign power coincides with Indonesian lead\xad\ners’ hopes for the area. Indonesia has long \nemphasized national self-reliance and is today \none of the most genuinely interested of the \nSoutheast Asian countries in collective self\xad\n13 Cambodia, like Vietnam and Laos, was not \naffected by President Nixon’s August, 1971, 10 per \ncent foreign aid cut (resulting from the United \nStates’ external economic difficulties).\n14 This was the estimate of television commenta\xad\ntor Eric Severeid on the CBS evening news report, \nSeptember 30, 1971.\nreliance through one or another form of \nmultinational cooperation. Some leaders in \nthe other insular lands—the Philippines, Ma\xad\nlaysia and Singapore—were disappointed at \nthe United States expressed intention to play \na reduced peace-keeping role, but others \n(representing the majority point of view at \nleast in Malaysia and Singapore) welcomed \nthe development as a long-term goal.\nIn the case of all four of these countries, \nthere are circumstances which seem to make \nthe Nixon Doctrine appropriate. To begin \nwith, they are farther from China (or from \nNorth Vietnam) than their mainland neigh\xad\nbors to the immediate north. The danger of \nexternally directed subversion is not immedi\xad\nately pressing. Their geographical make-up \nas island nations, moreover, means that most \nof their frontiers are sea frontiers. Given the \nlimited capabilities to violate these frontiers \nby their most likely adversaries, the insular \nnations are relatively free from the kind of \nfears that Thailand has of a North Vietnam\xad\nese-controlled Laos, for example, or that \nBurma has of China.\nThis is not to say that Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, Malaysia and Singapore do not \nhave problems. But the Philippines’ prob\xad\nlems, for example, are largely domestic: mal- \ndistributed wealth, self-serving political \nleadership, alienated youth and imperfect na\xad\ntional integration. The chief challenge to the \nSuharto government in Indonesia is the de\xad\nvelopment and distribution of that country’s \nconsiderable resources to the relative satis\xad\nfaction of the many groups that comprise that \ncomplex land. And Malaysia’s greatest con\xad\ncern is the delicate relationship among its \ntwo chief ethnic groups, the Malays and the \nChinese.\nThe position of the Nixon Doctrine is that \nthese are the important questions and that, \nwhile outside assistance may be helpful, out\xad\nsiders cannot solve such problems. No less \nimportant, there has never been any sugges\xad\ntion that Indonesia, Malaysia or Singapore \nwould ever welcome the kind of help the \nUnited States has given South Vietnam, Laos \nor Cambodia.\nThe Philippines may be different, however.\n', "326 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1971\nThe author arrived in Manila in the wake of \nthe 1969 Nixon visit and was repeatedly asked \nby Filipinos—political personalities, students \nand others—if it were true that the President \nhad disavowed any intention to intervene \nmilitarily on behalf of an embattled Filipino \nregime that might be about to fall as a result \nof domestic Communist pressure or assault.15 \nThe first Marcos administration was not so \nbeseiged, and the question seemed theoretical. \nIt is open to question, of course, how really \nembattled a subsequently reelected President \nFerdinand Marcos is today, but he is weaker \n—and extremist elements are stronger—than \nthey were in 1969. A Marcos request for \nUnited States military help against interna', \nfoes in the future cannot be discounted.\nBut the fact is that the Nixon Doctrine can \nwork in insular Southeast Asia—if the United \nStates and the countries of the area can live \nwith consequences such as an extremist left- \nwing Filipino regime. No insular Southeast \nAsian country is today confronted with the \nimminent possibility that its best efforts to \nsolve its internal problems could be quickly \noverturned by a war largely directed from \noutside its territory.\nTHE TESTING GROUND\nIt is in mainland Southeast Asia that the \nNixon Doctrine has received its severest test \nto date, and where it will probably continue \nto be tested in the years ahead. This is the \npart of Southeast Asia where United States \npolicies have actually changed least of all \nsince 1969. It is one thing for a President to \nsignal that policies will be changed; it is an\xad\nother for his government to respond to prob\xad\nlems of the area in a truly different manner.\nThe lands of mainland Southeast Asia differ \nfrom the insular countries to their south in \nseveral ways, and it is because of these dif\xad\nferences that United States policies towards \nthe two Southeast Asias may have to become\n15 The occasion of the visit was a month-long \nlecture tour during which he met with students on \nmore than three dozen campuses on all the majer \nPhilippine islands.

First \nof all, Burma, Laos and North Vietnam share \ncommon frontiers with China, and some Thai \nleaders feel that they might as well share a \nfrontier in view of the road the Chinese are \nillegally building across northern Laos towards \ntheir border. North Vietnam, of course, is \nSouth Vietnam’s neighbor to the immediate \nnorth; Thailand and Burma also border \ntroubled Laos (as do Cambodia and South \nVietnam); and the Thai have a common \nfrontier with Cambodia. In short, there is \nlittle or no distance between the mailand \ncountries, on the one hand, and China and \nher neighbor and ally, North Vietnam, on \nthe other.* \nWith the exception of Burma, whose cir\xad\ncumstances could change dramatically over\xad\nnight, the main problems facing the non- \nCommunist mainland Southeast Asian lands \nare overwhelmingly external. The chief im\xad\nmediate concern of both Laos and Cambodia \nis the fact that unwanted Communist Viet\xad\nnamese are illegally on their national soil. \nThailand is more threatened today by a possi\xad\nble adverse turn of events in either Laos or \nCambodia than by any present or likely in\xad\nternal difficulty (and the Bangkok govern\xad\nment also quietly supports ex-Burmese Pre\xad\nmier U Nu’s attempt to topple neighboring \nstrongman General Ne Win as a kind of in\xad\nsurance policy against a future disintegration \nof the Burmese state encouraged by China). \nBurma’s several internal insurgencies notwith\xad\nstanding, Ne Win’s own main fear also seems \nto be of enlarged Chinese support of one or \nanother group of rebels.\nThere is a third major difference between \n(Continued on page 366)\nRichard Butwell, chairman of the depart\xad\nment of political science at the State Univer\xad\nsity of New York College at Brockport, was \nformerly on the faculty of American Univer\xad\nsity and the National War College.

This is what may best be termed \ntheir capabilities as independent nation-states. \nThailand excepted, the mainland Southeast \nAsian countries that lie to the east of Vietnam \nare among the weakest and most vulnerable \nin Asia.\nA major assumption underlying the Nixon \nDoctrine’s emphasis on self-reliance is a capa\xad\nbility for such self-reliance on the part of \nthe states of Southeast Asia. The government \nof Laos at no time in the 1960’s possessed \nsuch a capability, however, and does not have \nit today.16 Little has been done to date, \nmoreover, that makes it likely that Laos will \nbe able to hold her own against the invading \nCommunist Vietnamese (or even against the \nhome-grown Pathet Lao Communist rebels) \nin the next half decade.17\n16 Laos has probably never been the scene of the \n“secret war” that critics of the Johnson and Nixon \nadministration have charged, because press and \nscholarly writing on Laos through the years has \nbeen fairly good. One of the best recent treat\xad\nments of the U.S. role in the country is Roland \nA. Paul’s “Laos: Anatomy of an American Involve\xad\nment,” Foreign Affairs, April, 1971.\n17 “The amount of American money used in \nLaos staggers the imagination,” D. E. Ronk has \nwritten. “Laos, variously reported, ranks either \nfirst or second in per capita input in the world, \nthough totals are still being researched by the \nUnited States Congress. This, again, demands \nterms comparable to amounts, even though Laos \nremains one of the poorest, least modernized states \nin the world.” Dispatch News Service Interna\xad\ntional, August 2, 1971, p. 3.\n18 For a contrary assessment, see “Forever \nKhmer,” in the Far Eastern Economic Review, \nSeptember 4, 1971 (pp. 22-23).\n19 United States responsibility for bombing activ\xad\nity in the delta region of South Vietnam was trans\xad\nferred to the Saigon government on October 2, \n1971, for example.\n20 There is less than complete agreement within \nthe Thai ruling group, however, regarding the wis\xad\ndom of reliance upon the U.S.S.R. Deputy Pre\xad\nmier Prapass Charusathiara, for example, is espe\xad\ncially concerned with the dangers the Soviets al\xad\nlegedly pose for Thailand. See his attack on Soviet \n“subversion” of Thai students in the Bangkok Post, \nJuly 27, 1971.\nCambodia is probably in better condition \nin this respect than Laos. For one thing, \nCambodia has not suffered the destruction \nand demoralization that Laos has endured \nfor more than a decade. Difficult though her \ncircumstances may be at the present time, \nshe seems to be responding to the efforts of \nher leadership and of the Americans to in\xad\ncrease her capability for dealing with the \nproblem of unwanted Communist Vietnamese \non her soil and with the problem of the in\xad\ndigenous Communist apparatus and war- \nmachine that Hanoi has sought to encour\xad\nage.18 But Cambodia is still a long way from \nbeing able to stand on her own feet against \nthe Communist Vietnamese challenge.\nAs for South Vietnam, the government \nappears to have significantly increased its \ncapabilities for coping with the Communist \nchallenge in the years since 1965,19 but \nwhether it has improved them enough re\xad\nmains to be seen.\nA VARIED IMPACT\nThe impact of the Nixon Doctrine on the \nmainland Southeast Asian non-Communist \ncountries could not have been more varied. \nIt is difficult to discern any impact in the \ncase of Burma, the land least affected by any \naspect of United States policy, including the \nescalation of the war in Vietnam in the \n1960’s. On the other hand, the impact has \nthus far been the greatest in Vietnam, where \nthe United States military presence has been \nreduced by nearly 360,000 since April, 1969.\nThailand’s response to the Nixon Doctrine \nhas yet to be clarified. The Thai are clearly \nuncomfortable with the proclaimed change in \nthe United States role in the area, but they \nare fighting, with the Americans, on behalf of \na government in Laos that they want to sur\xad\nvive. At the same time, the Bangkok govern\xad\nment has explored opportunities for reduced \ntension with China (which aids anti-govern\xad\nment rebels on its soil) and has probed Soviet \ninterest in helping it to maintain its freedom \nfrom Chinese domination.20\nAs for Laos and Cambodia, the Nixon \nDoctrine seems to have had no impact on \nthem at all. United States policies towards\n', 'Articles Concluded 367\nLaos are just about what they were when \nPresident Nixon took office. In Cambodia, \nthe United States has become more involved \nthan ever since the enunciation of the Nixon \nDoctrine.\nIS THE NIXON DOCTRINE ENOUGH?\nThe Nixon Doctrine—in its application to \nother parts of Asia and the world as well as \nto Southeast Asia—may turn out to be one \nof the most valuable shifts in United States \nforeign policy in several decades. Presidents \nDwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and \nLyndon B. Johnson were probably too much \ninfluenced by the various policies so appro\xad\npriately pioneered by President Harry S Tru\xad\nman in the first years after World War II. \nPresident Nixon has faced realities on the \nAsian scene in particular (including the need \nto narrow differences with the Chinese) that \nhis predecessors would—or could—not face.\nOn the other hand, it is much easier to pro\xad\nclaim policy changes than to carry them out. \nWith regard to Laos and Cambodia, President \nNixon has had to face problems similar to \nthose that confronted his predecessors in Viet\xad\nnam and Laos, problems which none of them \nwere able to master.\nIt may well be that the Nixon Doctrine is \nappropriate for its time in insular Southeast \nAsia, possibly for Thailand (mainland South\xad\neast Asia’s strongest non-Communist state), \nand even for Burma (clearly its most genu\xad\ninely independent country). It may even be \nthe best of all possible United States policies \n—at long last—for Vietnam. But it is hard \nto see that the Nixon Doctrine is at all appro\xad\npriate for Laos and Cambodia, if it is a \nUnited States objective to prevent Com\xad\nmunist Vietnamese absorption of these two \nlands, and if it is possible to prevent such an \neventuality.\nPOSSIBILITIES FOR VIOLENCE \nIN MALAYSIA \n(Continued from page 344)\nization” process. Recent policies to restruc\xad\nture the educational system do not seem to \nhave emerged out of long-range planning\nefforts but rather to be expedient adaptations \nto political crises. The various ethnic groups, \nfurthermore, indicate attitudes of suspicion \nif not of outright hostility toward increased \ncontact with one another.\nThe present system seems to lack the credi\xad\nbility necessary for affective loyalties and the \neconomic capacity to deliver instrumental \nopportunities. The emerging 6!ite are ex\xad\npected to accept a passive role.
