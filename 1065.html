Jan. 8. The treaty\npowers have undertaken the protec\ntion of the railroad between Pek\ning and the, sen. Interruption of\ntraffic along this line, which has\nprevented the passage of the malls\nfor several days, has resulted in\nthis derision. Detachments of\nIiritish, German, Japanese and\nFrench troops have been stationed\nat intervals between Peking and\nChin Wang Tao, according to the\nplan devised two months ago. A\nJapanese general is in command,\nas he is the ranking officer.\nThe respective nations assume\ncharge ol different sections of the\nroad, Great llrltaln taking care of\nthe section between Peking and\nYang Tsun; France between Yang\nTsun and Tank Ku; Germany, Tang\nKu to Tnagshan; the jolted States,\nTank Shan to Lanchow, and Japan,\nLnchow to Chin Wng Tao.\nThe United Sttes. however, has\nthe section allotted to it, but Iirit\nish troops are protecting that dis\ntrict until Americans arrive.\nJust when additional American\ntroops will reach China is not yet\nknown, although Minister Calhoun\ncabled several days ago to the\nstate department at Washington ad\nvising the dispatch of a regiment\non a peace footing. So far be has\nreceived no reply.\nIt is announced that the tracks\nhave ben repaired and mails are\ncoming through, but a similar state\nment has been made by the Chi\nnese foreign, board several times\nbefore without basis of fact.\nYuan Shi Kal is pleased at the\naction of tho power, because II\nrelieves the imperial administration\nof responsibility and insures the\nmaintenance of communicailoi;\nwhich the imperial troops might bj\nunable to do.

This\nbid was thrown out and the con\ntract given to a drug house at 35\ncents for all prescriptions filled for\ncounty Institutions. The health of\nficer\'s plum . at $100 per month\nwas handed to Dr. ichards. There\nwas a note attached to his bid\nwhat he wouldn\'t charge for, but\n1Ib note or proviso, was all O. K.\nwith the commissioners. If it did\nwork defeat to tho other bidders.\nTa-re was only one bidder on fuel\nto be furnished the county build\nings for the year 1912. Coal deal\ners say "nothing doing" when it\ncomes to putting in bids, for last\nyear the contrast waa awarded to\ntho highest bidder.\nNow comes the funny story of\nall yearly contracts awarded. The\nstreet-cleaning contract of the town\nof Tonopah waa sought for by three\nreliable persons, as follows: John\nClendenning, $275; Frank Myer,\n$258, and Ed Powers $180 per\nmonth. The commissioners refused\nto accept Powers\' bid, claiming he\nwas not a reliable person (but he\nIs reliable nevertheless), and then\nawarded the contract to Frank\nMyer at $258 per month. This little\nJuggling will cost the town of\nTonopah $936 additional for the\nyear 1912. The county print Ins\nwas awarded to the Post at Man\n. hattan for $600 a year. The Ronnn\nza, next lowest bid, was for $1033.\na difference of $438, but the com\nmissioners evidently did not want\nto gjve publicity to their trans\nactions so selected the Manhattan\npaper, but in the face of this they\nrequire the taxpayers of Tonopnh\nto plngle up $936 gift ti\nsomebody.\nThe taxpayers will have to stand\nlhe doings until the first Monday\ntn January, 1)13. Say nothing,\nhut saw wood in the meantime.\nl,ant Saturday Carl Gonlin, the\nmanage rof the Round Mountain\nTungsten Mining & Milling com\npany, was tn Tonopah to receive a\nfew small missing parts of machin\nery to complete the new tungsten\nmill recently constructed at Round\nMountain. The new plant, which\nof the roller process, has a ca\npacity of 50 tons daily and the com\ning spring the plant will be in\ncreased to a 600-ton daily output.\nThe mill Is situated about two and\na half miles east of Hound Moun\ntain, near the tungsten mine of\nthe company. At the present time\nthere is in sight and ready to be\ntaken out 1,000,000 tons of tung\nsten ore that wil average $22 a\nton. The concentrates of this ore\nwill net the company from $500\nto $700 per ton. The tungsten In\nthe Round Mountain ore is the\nhighest per cent produced In Amer\nlea, thus proving that Nye county\nis becoming a leader of all metals\nmined. Atkins, Kroll Sc. Co., metal\nlurgists of Saa Francisco, have just\nclosed a deal whereby the entire\nproduct of the mill is sold to them.\nThe first shipment of concentrates\nill be made about the 20th Inst.\nSAN 1)1 EGO, Cftl., Jan. 8. With\nhis sea bride of not more than\ntwo weeks crying by his side,\nI humus Smith, twenty years old,\nmember of one of the oldest fami\nlies -the IJeales of Phlladeip .\nand one of four- heirs to one of the\nbiggest estates of that city, was de\nclared a dependent person before\nJudge Guy In the juvenile court\nhere Saturday afternoon and order\ned committed to a sanitarium tor\ntrial. Mrs. Smith is twenty-six\nyears old and a daughter of a\nwell-known KI Cajon family. The\nwife may not be allowed to accom\npany her husband.\nIt is thought the fight for the\nyouth\'s liberty will be carried to a\nhigher court The complaint was\nsworn to by Dr. .1. C. Hearne, rep\nresenting 1-eonaid T. lieale of Phil\nadelphia, uncle and guardian of\nSmith.\nSmith, who will not reach his\nmajority until next fall, several\nmonths ago came to San Diego to\nlive. He is a nephew of Mr. and\nMrs. Charles K. Kelly of Mission\nHills. After spending some time\nIn San Diego the youth decided to\ntry ranching. Accordingly he went\nto KI , Cajon, where he met Emma\nCross, daughter of J. II. Cross,\na prominent rancher. The couple\nfell In love, and, finding no other\nway by which they could bo mar\nried, they chose going to sea.\nrn days ago they were married\naboard Captain Walter A. Cobb\'s\nboat, the Dolphin, outside the three-\nmile Unlit. The Rev. Stephen ).\nEmerson of San Diego performed\nthe ceremony.\nREDDING, Cal., Jan. 8. The\nbandit who captured the mail car\non train No. 16 Saturday morning\nIs believed to be In hiding in this\ncity. It is themght improbable tuit\nhe could have made his escape on\nthe train or any of the wagon\nroads leading from this cty without\nbeing seen. Theory is all the ofil-\ncers have to work upon, and the\ntheories are quietly exploded.\nThe only developments are the\narrival of Postal Inspector Gray\nand the offers of rewards of $1000\neach by the United States govern\nment and the Southern Pacific. Rail\nroad company. Sheriff Montgomery\nof . this county It co-operating with\nthe postal authorities in the effort\nto run down the robber.\nHave Good 1t-criplloii.\nThe only clue to the bandit is. a\ngood description given by the mall\nclerks whom he bound and gagged\nwhile the train was running between\nRod Dluff and Cottonwood. The\nrobber Is 5 feet 8 inches in height\nand weighs about 160 pound, Is\nabout 35 years old. lie wore a\nblue serge suit and a brown slouch\nkat, which he kept pulled down\nover his eyes. In speech he was\npolite to the clerks In bis power\nand had a soft voice. t\nThe facts that he left absolutely\nno clues except his description aud\nthat he made his escape so readily,\nleads some to believe that he had\nconfederates in his carefully planned\nand successful robbery.\nt-fitJ Bl-linnu I - Vi i 1 A nn (ha nmll\ni P ll 11 rflvuMlnna Vi n n n ,\nthrow out the mall sacks at Cot\ntonwood and Anderson give reason\nfor the theory that ho was a former\nmall clerk. The strongest fact In\nsupport of this theory Is that he\nknew that Chief Clerk Rhein car\nried the key to the registered mall.\nHis actions on the car were cool\nana determined, and never once\ndid he drop the revolver that he\nheld in his hand. He held the\npistol even while ho rifled the mall\nThe rapidity with which he carried\nout his plans shows that everything\nwas planned with care. He made\nthe mall clerks put their feet In\nempty mail sacks, which he tied\ntightly, and all three men were\nbound and gaged in the same man\nner. Tho cleverness of his escape\nequals the success of his plan to\ncapture and rob the mail car on\na train of several cars passing\nthrough two towns. The time of\nthe train In making the run from\nRed Dluff to Redding was an hour\nand twenty minutes.\nr-M-M-M-M,ll - - - - "WVW-M-M-M-M-M-W-W-WW-U-U-UU-\nMUX, TOO, S.WS JORDAN, WHO\nI\'OIXTS OCT ll.M-Xi.UJTY OK\nXKW REGISTRATIONS.\nSACRAMENTO, Jan. 8. There\nseems to be no doubt now that\nall men and women in the state\nwho have registered to vote, since\nJanuary 1 without giving their ages\nto the registering officer will have\nto register again before they will\nbe legally entitled to vote. This\nquestion was brought to the atten\ntion of Secretary of State Frank\nJordan by county clerks who want\ned to know whether they should\nmake this year\'s registrations un\nder the old form of affidavit, w\nrequires voters to give their ages,\nor the new form approved by the\nspecial session of the legislature,\nwhich eliminates the age provision.\nMany county clerks, and this Is\nparticularly true in Sacramento\ncounty, have been using the new\nform.\nSecretary Jordan has ruled, and\nit is said that he is backed up in\nthis by Attorney-General Webb, that\nthe new form cannot be used un\ntil March 24, or ninety days later\nthan the adjournment of the legis\nlature, granted that the governor\nshould sign the bill.\nLAW AND MOTION\nCALENDAR TODAY\nToday the .following calendar was\ncalled in Judge AveriU\'s court and\nAfter the marriage the father of \'the following cases set for trial:\nANDY" SMITH\nMAY LOSE JOB\nwork hrsiKxin.\nTh work on tho UU drilling\nrlC at th Iltatkwrlt ranch h.t\nbwn KUiHnil-d.

A most Inter\nesting bit of gossip Is current In\nhigh official circles which, If true,\nmay have a most important bearing\non the development of the world\nhistory in the near future.\nIt Is no less than that the kaiser\nhas set his mind on bringing about\na new triple alliance which will In\nclude Germany, England and the\n1\'nlted States. Whether there Is\nanything more than gossip In the\nreport is, of course, Impossible to\nsay, but It Is being discussed in\nall seriousness.\nIt a pointed out that such a\ncombination would be absolutely to\ndominate the world. In naval\nstrength It would be irresistible.\nWhile there Is no conceivable com\nbination of powers which could hope\nto successfully cope with it on\nland, more than this. It would\nhave almost a monopoly in finances.\nWith these three great powers\nworking together war would be\npractically impossible, and they\ncould if they would. Impose on the\nworld a policy of disarmament and\nof international arbitration. By\nJust what means the kaiser hopes\nto bring about such an alliance.\nIf he does, is not known, but It Is\nbelieved in Germany if he really\nsets his mind to do it he will.\nV-l.d4if th !.!.

The story read like\nTennyson\'s poem, "The Princess," o:ily the Eves\nof this Adainless Kdon in the Pacific ocean were\nnot man-eaters. All of them were reported as\nbeing exceedingly anxious to obtain husbands,\nwith whom they might divide their shares in the\noeoanut grows and the pearl oyster beds.\nThe tabs was so attractive and so convincing\nthat an expedition was made up in all seriousness\nin San Francisco to go to the niauless isle. Quite\na number of apparently sensible men in all walks\nof life contributed toward the purchase of a ves\nsel and complete equipments for housekeeping in\nthe South Seas. Even the latitude and longtitudc\nof the Adainless Eden were given, so it seemed\nIhat there could be no mistake about it. Taking\nplenty ol blank- marriage licenses along, the ex\npedition started, but it never located the manless\nisle. This place proved to be only the -diva-of\nan over-imaginative skipper.\nei. . , . , .\ni ins is no insinuauon against, tne suipper v\nlocated Ihe Arctic tropics. There is no reason\nto doubt his word. P.ut should any adventurous\nspirits be considering the advisability of starti\norange groves in this new territory, it is sii;;.\nthat they consider the fale of the expedition thai\nslat-ted in quest of the manless isle. It savors of\nthe project of locating the Phantom Ship with a\nview to salving the treasure that Captain Vander\ndecken is supposed to have had in his chests.\nhas heeii p\nlast seven\nxporls to\nif 10.000.1 N 10\n111 thes,\ncut off her\nprovocat inn\nunlikely.\ncade our\nm , under\nl.ltllll\ntlVlllc,\nqually\nthe\nstollt Ii\nAn eligible vniui.\nleap year, wants a\nr too thin. g. u,(\nM l U li h some Hie, 1 1\n\'lie io think of it.\nwaited for the b\nit\nm r. it ai\npeels.

As\nregard rifles, Mr. Svenson has la\nvented two kinds of appliances, one\nof which can be used as an or\ndinary rifle and another as a ma\nchine gun. Mr. Svenson claims\nthat his weapon can and will be\nmade to perform both functions\nwithout its weight In any way be\ning Increased. It can be loaded\neither at the breach or under\nneath by inserting the cartridge\nmagazine.\nA company of infantry equipped\nwith the new rifle and forming a\nfront of 15 paces, can fire, it is\nsaid, 70 shots per second, or if\nbattery of machine guns, consisting\nof four pieces, served by 16 men,\nwith their officers, would occupy a\nfront of 15 paces and fire under the\nsame conditions only 32 to 95 shots,\nrespectively, In the same space of\ntime.\nIn addition to this, machine guns\nare difficult to transport, or to\nplace In position, or to hide from\nthe enemy, which is not the case\nwith the rlflo of the Svenson type.\nThe new weapon, Is about the\nsame weight as the Mauser rifle,\nand has the same kind of barrel,\nbut its entire length is five centi\nmeters shorter. Another advantage\nis its simplicity of construction,\np ssetsiug, as it does, only 17 mov\nable parts, including the spiral\nsprings.\nOTHER SIDE\nOF SHOOT-UP\nThe Elko Independent gives a dif\nferent version of the shooting affair\nat Red House, where a man named\nHess was accused of all kinds of\nshooting stunts. The paper says:\n"Sheriff Harris returned laBt eve\nning from his trip to the Red\nHouse after Fred Hess, who is\ncharged with shooting up that place\nlast week. He and Constable Kep\npier arrived at the Red House on\nWednesday night and found Hess,\nwho came out of the house and\ngreeted the officers as If he was\nnot charged with attempting to kill\nthree or four people.\n"Hess had no frozen toes or\nhands, and had suffered no discom\nfort from the Intense cold. Neither\nhad he frequented Indian camps\nmore than usual nor hid out nights\nin the sagebrush dodging officers.\n"From what Sheriff Harris learn\ned ut the Red House, the sensa\ntional story told by the parties wh\ncaused the arrest of Hess, should\nbe taken with many grains of salt\nIt uppears from the story told\nSheriff Harris by Hess and McCon\nnell that the affair was nothing\nmore or less than a drunken brawl,\nIn which all the parties involved\nwere pretty well filled with the bug\nJuice."\n812\nMAIN STREET\nPRETTY WOMAN\nHAS CHARMS\nFOR THE KING\nBANGKOK, Jan. 8. An Incident\nthe recent coronation of the new\nn of Siam, which bag Just come\nthe knowledge of Europeans,\nows how western notions do not\nways fit in with eastern custom.\nThe king has a strong predilec\ntion for amateur theatricals, and\nbad arranged a gala in connection\nltn tiie coronation. Rahsanart, a\nmember of his suite, has a very\npretty wife, and he objected to her\ntaking part In the performance,\neven going to the length of send\ning her homo from the theater dur\nIn\ng a rehearsal.\nThis action so Incensed the king\nthat he deprived the uufortunate\nman of his title, sentenced him to\none year\'s imprisonment and or\nered him to receive thirty hlows\nrith a rattan. After this had been\ncarried into effect the wife was\ncompelled to go on attending the\nrehearsals.\nThe affair caused a very un\npleasant impression, hot only among\nthe Europeans in Slam, but also\namong the better class of Siamese\nIt Is stated that the king of Siam\nproposes to favor the courts of Eu\nrope with a visit next autumn, and\nthat he will grace England with\nhis presence for some months.\nSECOND VICTIM OF TAYLOR\'S\nItlLLET IS DEAD\nNews has been received hre of\nthe death of Robert Scttlemyre, who\nwas shot by J. M. Tayor at the\nCarlson ranch, near Andrews, Ore.,\non December 21. Settlemyre died\nsix days after he was shot. His\ndeath made a double tragedy of the\nshooting affray, Taylor having killed\nboth Albert H. I\'erry and Settle\nmyre with the same\' bullet, the lat\nter being an innocent victim.\nTaylor, who was arrested at\nDenlo and held for several days\nwas taken front there to Rums,\ntne county seat of Harvey county\nby the sheriff, but It is not known\nwhether or not his preliminary ex\namination has been held or not.\nCALIFORNIA\'S KEL WORM STINK\nAlthough California succeeded In\nkicking up quite a stink in refer\nence to the eel worm In the Ne\nvada spud (which pest she origin\nally snipped into us by the seed\npotato route), she has only helped\nadvertise the superiority of the Ne\nvada spud product over that grown\non California\'s soil. She could not\nkick up stench enough to blind\npeople to the fact that every short\nwhile California is earthquake rid\nden from Frisco to Fresno on the\nsouth and Eureka on the north.\nResides, she has other undesirable\nthings, which, to paraphrase, read:\nCalifornia advertises "Climate the\nBest "\nHut she\'s the home of the flea\nAnd the Heathen Chinee\nAnd the "Native Son" of the Gold\nen.

He penned\nhis communication thus:\n"Dear Sir: My razor-back stroll\ned down your track a week ago\ntoday. Your twenty-nine came\ndown the line and snufTed his life\naway. You can\'t blame me, the\nbog, you see, slipped through a\ncattle gate; so kindly pen a check\nfor ten, the debt to liquidate.."\nHe received the "following reply:\n"Old twenty-nine came down the\nline and killed your ho,?, we know,\nbut razor-backs on railroad tracks\nquite often meet with woe. There\nfore, my friend, we cannot send\nthe check for which you pine.
