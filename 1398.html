This only goes to show what an admirable advan\ntage the State Banks of Kansas offer depositors. In the\ncase of the Pennsylvania bank the statement showed re\nmarkable strength, but no one except those on the inside\nwere able to tell in what form of paper, or security, this\ngreat surplus was invested, hence could not tell the rotten\ncondition of that bank. In Kansas the State Banking Law\nhas provided an absolute protection to the depositor, so\nthat he does not have to worry about what the statement\nsays, for he knows that his funds cannot be lost through\nthe mismanagement of a lot of fellows, who, instead of\nrunning a bank, ought to be off-bearing in a brick yard.\nOURS IS THE ONLY BANK IN BAXTER\nSPRINGS IN WHICH DEPOSITS ARE\nGUARANTEED.\nThe Baxter State Bank.\nHome Grown Seed Corn.

It is demadded of\nhim by the public by the peopl\nwho pay for the paper, by those\newtnn m v wnw r np iiai i-r . 1 v iiiiuri\nwho constitute the citizenship of\nthe community, and if he fails\nin this duty the burden of cen\nsure falls upon bis snouiaers\nalone. The public accepts no\nexcuse.\nEditors are only human and\nare not gifted with second sight.\nThey cannot tell what is hap\npening beyond their range of\nhearing or vision, although they\nare popularly supposed to know\neverything and a little besides.\nThey must depend upon their\neyes and ears for every item of\nnews that appears in the paptr,\nand in this they should have the\nloyal cooperation of every resi\ndent.\nCourtesy extended to the edi\ntor of the local paper is as bread\ncast upon the waters. It bears\nfruit in many fold.\nChurches, societies, clubs, or\nganizations of every nature ex\npect the editor to push their\ncauses along, to-give them ad\nvance publicity, and after the\nevents to place them in proper\nlight before the public at large.\nHe is expected to boost every\nthing and everybody in the com\nmunity, to advertise the. town\nand its advantages, and to guard\nits welfare in all ways.\nHe of course is willing enough,\nbut it costs him time and money\nto do it, and in return be is en-\ntitled to every reasonable cour-\ntesy thai can be extended to him.\nIt is the universal law of cour-\ntesy to the press."\nThe Court of Last Resort.\nAround the stove of the cross\nroads grocery is the real court of\nast resort, for it finally over\nrules all others. Chamberlain\'s\nCough Remedy has been brought\nbefore this court in almost every\ncross roads grocery in this coun\ntry, and has always received a\nfavorable verdict.
