This process includes accumulation of collagen\n(i.e., fibrosis) and dysregulation of active matrix metalloproteinases\n(MMPs). Exercise training (ET) improves\ncardiac function, but the pathways of protection remain\npoorly understood. Young (3 mo) and old (31 mo)\nFBNF1 rats were assigned into sedentary and exercise\ngroups, with ET group rats training on a treadmill 45\nmin/d, 5 d/wk for 12 wk. Nonlinear optical microscopy\n(NLOM), histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and\nWestern blot analyses were performed on the left\nventricle and septum. NLOM, IHC, and histological\nimaging revealed that ET reduced age-associated elevation\nof collagen type I fibers. Active MMP-1, active\nMMP-2, and MMP-14 in the ECM fraction of the left\nventricle were reduced by aging, an effect abrogated by\nET. Tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP-1) was elevated\nwith age but protected by ET. Transforming growth\nfactor-\x01 (TGF-\x01), upstream regulator of TIMP-1, increased\nwith age but was attenuated by ET. Therefore,\nexercise training could protect the aging heart against\ndysregulation of MMPs and fibrosis by suppressing\nelevation of TIMP-1 and TGF-\x01.—Kwak, H.-B., Kim,\nJ.-H., Joshi, K., Yeh, A., Martinez, D. A., Lawler, J. M.\nExercise training reduces fibrosis and matrix metalloproteinase\ndysregulation in the aging rat heart. FASEB J.\n25, 1106–1117 (2011). www.fasebj.org\nKey Words: TIMP-1 \x01 collagen \x01 remodeling\nAging is characterized by progressive impairment of\nheart function, associated with significant mechanical\nremodeling that includes “fibrosis”, or accumulation of\ncollagen (i.e., fibrosis) and other extracellular matrix\n(ECM) proteins (1). The mechanical consequences of\nage-induced fibrosis and ventricular remodeling include\nincreased wall stress, decreased elasticity, im-\npaired early diastolic filling, and reduced rate of ventricular\nshortening (2–5). Aging results in a hypertrophied,\nyet weaker, heart, with greater internal work to overcome,\nthus reducing ejection fraction and increasing susceptibility\nfor arrhythmias (3, 6). Structural remodeling of the\naging heart indeed resembles that observed with heart\nfailure, and might in part be in response to increased\noverload (7–9).\nThe ECM in the heart is composed of connective\ntissue proteins including collagens, glycoproteins (e.g.,\nfibronectins, laminins, etc.), and proteoglycans (10).\nThe most abundant ECM fibrillar proteins in the heart\nare collagens, particularly the collagen type I and\ncollagen type III phenotypes (11). Connective tissue\nbinds to the cytoskeleton by transmembrane molecules,\nserving as a physical connection (10). Cardiac ECM\nserves 4 functions: providing a scaffold and support for\nmyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells; transmitting\nmechanical stress in and out of myocardial cells;\nensuring elasticity and compliance during the cardiac\ncycle; and mediating signaling for growth, survival, and\nremodeling (12). However, excessive myocardial fibrosis\noccurs in senescent hearts and impairs function\n(13). Indeed, type I collagen may accumulate 2- to\n3-fold with aging (9, 14). Age-associated fibrosis and\narchitectural remodeling in the heart are primarily a\nfunction of decreased collagen degradation and, to a\nlesser extent, increased collagen synthesis and proliferation\nof fibroblasts (9, 15). Aging also alters the geom-\netry of connective tissue by increasing the diameter of\ncollagen fibrils, decreasing linearity of myocyte sheaths,\nand increasing disorder (9, 16, 17).\nDegradation of fibrillar collagen and other ECM\nproteins is catalyzed by a family of zinc-dependent\nenzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),\nwith \x0120 members, including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3,\nMMP-9, and MMP-14 (12, 18). Activation of MMPs is\naccomplished by cleavage of their full-length proteins\n1 Correspondence: 276B Read Bldg., Redox Biology and\nCell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Health and Kinesiology,\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, Texas A&M\nUniversity, College Station, TX 77843-4243, USA.

MMPs and collagen turnover are suppressed by\ntissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which\ninhibit MMPs by binding to their active sites (18, 19). It\nis now recognized that dysregulation of MMPs and\nTIMPs is an important contributor to cardiac remodeling\ncharacteristic of both aging and heart failure (9,\n20). Indeed, large increases in TIMPs are linked with\nheart failure (21, 22). Upstream regulatory signaling\nfor TIMPs and fibrosis may include transforming\ngrowth factor-beta (TGF-\x02) and oxidative stress (13,\n23–25).\nInactivity or sedentary lifestyle decreases cardiac output\nand stroke volume, and exacerbates heart disease\nrisk (26). It is widely accepted that inactivity appears to\naccelerate cardiac aging (27). Regular exercise, particular\nendurance exercise, effectively improves heart\nfunction in both young and older populations (26–28).\nExercise training improves maximal cardiovascular\nwork capacity by increasing stroke volume and cardiac\noutput (26). It is possible that exercise training in aging\npopulations may reduce accumulation of connective\ntissue. Limited data indicate that exercise training\nmight attenuate collagen content in the aging heart\n(29). Collagen cross-linking [hydroxylysyl pyridinoline\n(HP)] of left ventricle (LV) free wall was significantly\nlower in old trained rats, compared with their sedentary\ncounterparts (6, 29). The ability of exercise training to\nattenuate diastolic dysfunction and collagen cross-linking\nwas recently cited (30). However, potential path-\nways by which exercise training ameliorates fibrosis in\nthe aging heart are not understood.\nTherefore, our purpose was 2-fold: to identify potential\nprotection by exercise training against geometric\nchanges in collagen fibers in LV using imaging techniques,\nincluding nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM);\nand to determine whether amelioration of age-associated\ndysregulation of MMPs is a prospective and novel mechanism\nof exercise protection. We hypothesize that 12 wk\nof exercise training will attenuate or prevent reduction in\nactive MMPs, linked with reduction in upstream regulators\nTIMPs and TGF-\x02 in the rat heart.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAnimals\nThe Fischer 344 \x03 Brown Norway F1 (FBNF1) hybrid rat\nstrain is a preferred U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)\naging model. Pathogen-free FBNF1 rats were purchased from\nthe National Institute on Aging colony (National Institute on\nAging, Bethesda, MD, USA). The FBNF1 rat was chosen\nbecause it is free of cardiovascular disease, allowing better\nassessment of true aging effects. Young (3 mo) and old (31\nmo) FBNF1 rats were used as our aging and exercise model.\nTreadmill training began at 31 mo of age, close to the mean\nlife span of the strain (31), for old rats and at 3 mo for young\nadults. Rats were thus 6 and 34 mo of age at the conclusion of\nthe study. Animals were housed on a 12-h light-dark diurnal\ncycle, and cared for in accordance with NIH and American\nPhysiological Association guidelines. All protocols had been\napproved by the University Laboratory Animal Compliance\nCommittee at Texas A&M University prior to commencement\nof the study.\nExercise training protocol and study design\nTo test exercise regulation of fibrosis and remodeling in the\naging heart, FBNF1 rats were trained on a treadmill at an\nintensity designed to \x0475% of maximal aerobic capacity,\nbased on our previous experience (32). Young (3 mo) and\nold (31 mo) rats were divided into the following groups:\nyoung sedentary (YS; n\x0510), young with exercise training\n(YE; n\x0510), old sedentary (OS; n\x0510), and old with exercise\ntraining (OE; n\x0510). Rats in the exercise training groups\nwere acclimated during the first 7 d by walking on the\nmotor-driven treadmill without incline at 10 m/min for 10\nmin. Rats were gradually conditioned to perform exercise on\na 12° incline up to 45 min over the first 3-wk training\nprogram. The exercise group then ambulated on the treadmill\nfor 45 min/d at a 12° incline, 5 d/wk for the remainder\n(9 wk) of the 12-wk protocol. Walking/running speeds were\n10.5 m/min (old) and 22 m/min (young) to reach a similar\nrelative intensity for each age group. This exercise regimen\nhad been shown previously to elevate citrate synthase activity\nas a marker of oxidative mitochondrial capacity in skeletal\nmuscle (33).\nRats in both the sedentary and exercise groups were now 6\nand 34 mo of age and were sacrificed at 48 h after the last\nexercise bout with 120 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. Hearts\nwere extracted, weighed, and dissected into the LV, septum,\nand right ventricle (RV). Heart samples were snap-frozen in\nisopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen for histochemical analysis\nand in liquid nitrogen for protein analysis. Samples\nremained at \x0680°C until analysis. Septa used in NLOM\nexperiments were fixed in 10% formalin.\nHomogenization and nuclear and connective tissue\nfractionization\nLV and septa samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (pH\nadjusted to 7.5) containing the following components: 20 mM\nHEPES, 350 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Igepal-CA630, 1 mM\nMgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM DTT, and\nprotease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at\n4°C. Tissues were minced and homogenized (20:1 w/v) in\nlysis buffer, using a ground glass on ground glass homogenizer\n(Bellco Biotechnology, Vineland, NJ, USA) and then\ncentrifuged twice at 10,000 g at 4°C. Soluble, nuclear, and\nECM muscle fractions were isolated for analysis as adapted\nfrom Zheng et al. (34). Briefly, heart samples were homogenized\n(7:1 w/v) in buffer A, containing 20 mM HEPES free\nacid, 10 mM HEPES Na salt, 350 mM mannitol, 10% glycerol,\n25 mM KCL, and 0.5 mM EDTA. Homogenates were centrifuged\n10 min at 3000 g at 4°C, and the supernatant was\nremoved. The pellet was resuspended (9:1 v/v) in buffer B,\ncontaining 20 mM HEPES free acid, 20 mM HEPES Na salt,\n350 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM\nEDTA, and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4°C.\nThe supernatant nuclear fraction was then removed as the\nnuclear fraction. The “insoluble” or ECM (connective tissue)\ntissue pellet was boiled, and then resuspended in 50 mM Tris\nbuffer with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1 mM dithiothreitol\n(DTT), and 0.6 mM EDTA. Poly(ADP-ribose)poly-\nmerase (PARP) in the first supernatant (cytosolic fraction) vs.\nthe nucleosome fraction and collagen type-I in the resuspended\nsecond pellet were used as markers to ensure the\nefficacy of the procedure in separating the nuclear fraction\nfrom soluble.\n1107EXERCISE, FIBROSIS AND MMP REGULATION IN THE AGING HEART\n', 'Histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nFor histology and IHC assays, LV cross sections were cut at a\ntemperature of \x0620°C and dried for 30 min. Hematoxylin\nwas used as a general stain for cardiomyocytes, nuclei, extracellular\narea, and geometry. Sections for IHCs were fixed in\nacetone (\x0620°C) for 60 min. We blocked LV with 10% serum\nof the secondary antibody host (e.g., goat) and 0.05%\nTween20, in PBS (15 ml) for 30 min. The desired primary\nantibody (collagen type-I: 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\nSanta Cruz, CA, USA) was then applied in blocking buffer\nand placed on the section for 1 h. After washing, biotinylated\nsecondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit) was applied to the\nsections (1:200 dilution in PBS buffer) and incubated for 30\nmin. Cross sections were then incubated at room temperature\nfor 30 min with Vectastain elite ABC reagent and incubated in\nperoxidase substrate solution (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA)\nfor 10 min until a red positive stain appeared (BioQuant\nsystem; BioQuant, San Diego, CA, USA). Hematoxylin was\nused as a counterstain for visualization.\nMasson’s trichrome stain for collagen and myocytes\nColorimetric staining method for collagen used included an\nadaptation of the Masson’s trichrome technique (35). In this\ntechnique, cardiomyocytes stain a bright red, collagen fibers\nblue, and nuclei black. Briefly, 10-\x07m frozen LV cross sections\nwere cut at \x0615°C and placed on a slide. After a 20-min\ndrying period, samples were fixed overnight at room temperature\nin Bouin’s solution. Slides were rinsed in distilled water\nfor 3 min, then running tap water for 5 min. Cross sections\nwere stained in Weigert’s hematoxylin for 15 min, washed in\ndistilled water, then washed in running tap water for 5 min.\nHeart samples were then stained with 1% Biebrich scarletacid\nfuschin for 15 min, then washed in distilled water for 5\nmin. After differentiation in 2.5% phosphomolybdic-phosphotungstic\nacid solution for 15 min, sections were trans-\nferred directly into 2.5% aniline blue solution for 12 min.\nHeart samples were then differentiated in 1% acetic acid\nsolution for 3 min, dehydrated in 95 and 100% ethanol, then\ncleared in xylene. Images were captured on a Zeiss Axioplot\nVision-series microscope and software (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,\nGermany), and quantified using the NIH ImageJ analysis program\n(NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Serial sections in 6 rats/group\nwere analyzed for percentage connective tissue area.\nCustom, state-of-the-art NLOM system\nTraditional 2-D histochemical imaging of collagen requires\nremoval of tissue samples, embedding, fixation, and sectioning.\nA novel imaging technology, NLOM, was used that relies\non nonlinear light matter interactions: 2-photon excited\nfluorescence (TPEF) and second-order harmonic generation\n(SHG). NLOM is designed to characterize intact cardiac\nmicrostructure, and is particular sensitive in the detection of\ninsoluble proteins including fibrillar collagen with autofluorescent\nproperties, via merging of TPEF and SHG signals. In\nour custom NLOM, we coupled sub-10-fs laser pulses (75MHz\nrepetition rate) into the epigalvanometer-driven motors\nmounted on an elevated breadboard (36). LV and septa\nsamples were positioned in the sample chamber for series of\n20-\x07m-thick wafer images.\nA 1:5:1 beam expanding telescope consisted of two near-IR\nachromatic lenses housed within the epifluorescence port\nappropriately imaged a spot from between the galvanometer\nmirrors to the back focal aperture of the microscope objective\nby a short-pass diachronic mirror. The focusing objective\ncollected nonlinear optical signals and directed them to a 2or\n16-channel multispectral detector unit mounted on acces-\nsory ports of the binocular head (nondescanned detection).\nThe 2-channel detector unit housed diachronic mirrors,\nbandpass filters, focusing lenses, and a pair of photoncounting\nphotomultiplier tubes (PMTs). For the multispec-\ntral detector, a multimode optical fiber delivered nonlinear\noptical signals to a line-ruled grating-based spectrometer and\n16-channel PMT array. Each PMT (channel) was connected\nto a preamplifier/discriminator, which fed a counter card\nmanaged by maximum image acquisition rate of 1 Hz. The\namount of dispersion introduced by the NLOM optical system\nchanged with each microscope objective. We had characterized\nand minimized dispersion in our NLOM optical system\nfor each of our microscope objectives (\x0320/0.75 NA, \x0320/\n0.5 NA, \x0340/0.8 NA, \x0363/0.95 NA, \x0363/1.2 NA, \x03100/1.0\nNA). We arranged dispersion compensating mirrors (DCMs)\nin a double-pass configuration, allowing a total of 32 bounces.\nThis geometry gave simple dispersion tuning up to \x066400 fs2\nand \x063800 fs3 in increments of \x06400 fs2 and \x06240 fs3,\nrespectively. We used combinations of antireflection-coated\nBK7 windows at 2, 3, or 4 mm thickness and fused silica wedge\npairs, each mounted on a linear translation stage providing\nan additional 400 \x07m to 3 mm of glass, for fine dispersion\ncompensation adjustments. This corresponded to precise\ncontrol of up to 518.2 fs2 and 62.5 fs3.\nWestern immunoblot\nProtein expression was determined by Western immunoblot\nanalysis similar to that outlined by Kwak et al. (37). LV\nhomogenate (20 \x07g) was loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels\nand electrophoresed using a Bio-Rad Protein III gel-box onto\na nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\nBriefly, separating gel (375 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8; 0.4% SDS;\nand 10% acrylamide) and stacking gel (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH\n6.8; 0.4% SDS; and 10% acrylamide monomer) solutions were\nmade, and polymerization was then initiated by tetramethylethylenediamine\n(TEMED) and ammonium persulfate. Sep-\narating and stacking gels were quickly poured into a Bio-Rad\nProtein III gel-box (Bio-Rad). LV samples in sample buffer\n(Tris, pH 6.8, with 2% SDS, 30 mM DTT, and 25% glycerol)\nwere electrophoresed at 150 V. The gels were then transferred\nat 30 V overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane\n(Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in\nPBS with 0.1% Tween-20 for 6 h. After blocking, membranes\nwere incubated at room temperature in blocking buffer for 12 h\nwith the appropriate primary antibodies: MMP-1 (1:1000; Calbiochem,\nSan Diego, CA, USA), MMP-2 (1:2000, Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology), MMP-3 (1:5000; Chemicon, Billerica, MA,\nUSA), MMP-9 (1:8000; Chemicon), MMP-14 (1:5000; Chemicon),\nTIMP-1 (1:1000; Chemicon), TIMP-2 (1:2000; Calbio-\nchem), TIMP-3 (1:2000; Cedarlane, Burlington, ON, Canada),\nTIMP-4 (1:1000; Chemicon), TGF-\x021 (1:250; R&D Systems,\nMinneapolis, MN, USA), and \x08-SMA (1:1000; Sigma, St. Louis,\nMO, USA). Following 3 washings with PBS with 0.1% Tween-20,\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies\nand an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system\n(Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used for visualization.\nDensitometry and quantification were performed using NIH\nImageJ. To ensure equal loading of protein, Ponceau-S staining\nwas performed for each membrane as an internal control, which\nconfirmed similar protein loading for each lane. In addition, the\nlane background reading was subtracted from each protein blot\ndensity reading. Further, additional samples from YS control rats\nserved as an internal comparison. Membranes were stripped and\nreprobed for GAPDH or \x02-actin as “housekeeping” proteins and\nused as another layer of loading controls.\n1108 Vol. 25 March 2011 KWAK ET AL.The FASEB Journal \x01 www.fasebj.org\n', 'Real-time qRT-PCR analysis\nTotal RNA was isolated from the heart tissues using an RNeasy\nMini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) with the addition\nof a proteinase K step based on our previously published\nmethodology for fibrous connective tissues (38). Total RNA\nquantity (A260 nm), purity (A260 nm/A280 nm, A260 nm/A230 nm)\nand integrity (RNA FA gels) were determined using a NanoDrop\nUV/Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUSA). Triplicate cDNA synthesis reactions were performed\nusing 200 ng of Total RNA in 30-\x07l RT reactions using SuperScript\nII RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Corp., Carls-\nbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturers protocol with\nsome slight modifications (38). For the specific gene of interest\n(e.g., collagen type I), a 5\t-TaqMan hydrolysis Q-PCR assay was\nperformed using an MX-3005P real time Q-PCR machine (Stratagene\nInc., La Jolla, CA, USA) as previously published (38). The\nrat Col 1a2 sequence (accession no. AF121217), forward (GTGCAGTCGGTGCTCCAG)\nand reverse (TTCTCCTTTGCCTC-\nCAGGTATG) primers, and a TaqMan probe (CTCTGCTGGTGCCTCTGGTCCTGGT)\ncontaining a 5\t-FAM fluorescent\nreporter and a 3\t-BHQ-1 quencher (BioSearch Technologies,\nNovato, CA, USA) were generated using Beacon Designer 2\nTaqMan multiplexing software, version 7.0 (Premier Biosoft,\nPalo Alto, CA, USA). Q-PCR standards were generated using\nsynthetic-DNA (sDNA) amplicon oligonucleotides (Biosynthesis\nInc., Lewisville, TX, USA) spanning the entire Q-PCR amplification\nregion (95 nt). A standard curve methodology was\nperformed to quantitate the specific gene targets of interest.\nSpecific standard aliquots (108 to 101 copies of cDNA) were used\nto generate a linear curve (\x01R2\x050.995) with a Q-PCR efficiency\n(slope) of \x063.3 to determine the cDNA copy number of\ntriplicate replicates. Each Q-PCR reaction employed a 3-min\ninitial 95°C activation step of the Quantifast-Probe Taq polymerase\n(Qiagen) followed by 40 cycles of 2-step thermocycling (3 s\nat 95°C and 30 s at 60°C). The cDNA copy number of the\ncollagen type I gene was normalized to the constitutively expressed\nrat cyclophilin A (accession no. M19533) gene (38). The\ncDNA copy number was derived for each sample based on\ntriplicate measurements and a group mean for each treatment\nused in the statistical analyses.\nStatistics\nTwo-way ANOVAs for repeated measures with Fisher’s LSD\npost hoc test where appropriate were used to assess mean\ndifferences between the test groups for aging and exercise.\nSignificance level was set at 0.05.\nRESULTS\nYoung (3 mo) and old (31 mo) FBNF1 rats were\ndivided into sedentary and exercise groups prior to the\n12-wk exercise protocol. At 48 h following the training\nperiod, hearts in all groups were extracted; dissected\ninto LV, RV, and septum; and snap frozen. Rats thus\nwere 6 and 34 m, respectively, for the young and old\nage groups at the completion of the study. The first set\nof experiments was designed to test the hypothesis that\nexercise training reduced fibrosis in the aging heart\nand mitigated alterations in geometry that might increase\ninternal work, impede diastolic filling, and im-\npair contractility. To do this, we visualized the ECM,\ncollagen, and collagen type-I accumulation.\nEffect of exercise training on connective tissue and\ncollagen in the aging heart\nHematoxylin staining revealed significant remodeling\nin the LVs from old rats. Extracellular space was greater\nin LVs from OS than the YS or exercise groups (Fig. 1A).\nThe geometry of the LV in the OS group assumed a more\nweblike appearance in contrast with the more linear\npattern of myocyte and extramyocyte space exhibited in\nyoung rats. In addition, the size of many of the cardiomyocytes\nwas larger in the OE and OS groups compared to\nthe YS and YE groups. However, substantially less remodeling\nwas exhibited in LV samples from the OS and OE\ngroups (Fig. 1A). A less alinear pattern with decreased\nextramyocyte space was seen. These observations with\nhematoxylin staining were similar to previous data quantified\nin a training study from our laboratory using the\nFischer-344 strain of rat (37). Exercise had no discernable\neffect of remodeling in the young age group.\nTo determine whether age- and exercise-related differences\nin extramyocyte space were related indeed to\nchanges in the ECM structural proteins such as collagen,\nwe used initially Masson’s trichrome staining to\nvisualize fibrillar collagen that might be located in the\nextramyocyte space. We found greater positive staining\nfor total collagen (blue) in LV samples from the OS rats\ncompared with LV s from young rats (Fig. 1B). Similar\nto the hematoxylin stains, a web-like geometric pattern\nwas also evident in the LVs from OS rats for collagen.\nCollagen-positive staining in the OS group was in stark\ncontrast with the clear linear or sheath-like patterns for\nmyocyte “pods” observed in the YS and YE groups.\nRemarkably, exercise training substantially reduced or\nmitigated age-related elevation in collagen-positive\nstaining (Fig. 1B). Clear protection against age-related\nalterations in collagen fiber network ultrastructure was\nobserved.\nWe also quantified collagen area in the LV by analyzing\nMasson’s trichrome staining using NIH ImageJ.\nOS rats displayed \x015-fold higher collagen-positive\nstaining in the LV compared with YS counterparts\n(Figs. 1B and 2A), or \x0125% of the LV. Exercise training\ndid indeed significantly reduce the amount or prevent\nthe accumulation of connective tissue in LVs from the\nOE group. Indeed, the amount of collagen-positive\nstaining in OE samples was quantified as less than half\nthat observed in the OS group, or 11% of the total area\npositive for collagen.\nTo test the hypothesis that exercise training reduces\naccumulation of connective tissue and collagen by\nreducing fibrous collagen type I, we used IHC with an\nantibody specific for collagen type I. Very little collagen\ntype I-positive staining was observed in LV samples for\nboth the YS and YE groups (Fig. 2A). In contrast,\nsignificant collagen type I-positive staining was visualized\nin the LV samples from OS rats. However, 12 wk of\nexercise training resulted in limited collagen type\nI-positive staining (Fig. 2A), consistent with the notion\nthat exercise protection against fibrosis and\n1109EXERCISE, FIBROSIS AND MMP REGULATION IN THE AGING HEART\n', 'accumulation of collagen was related to a reduction\nin collagen type 1.\nTraditional histochemical imaging of connective tissue\nand collagen requires removal of tissue samples,\nslicing, embedding and sectioning. A novel imaging\ntechnology, NLOM, is designed to characterize intact\ncardiac microstructure and is particularly sensitive to\ninsoluble proteins such as fibrillar collagen, via merging\nof TPEF and SHG signals. We used merged TPEF\nand SHG signaling to image and characterize collagenous,\nfibrous material in the septum of the heart, which\nalso undergoes significant remodeling with aging (39).\nConsistent with collagen and ECM staining described\nabove, an increased accumulation of fibrotic tissue was\nexpressed in hearts from OS rats. Substantial alinearity\nof collagen fibers was also observed in OS hearts (Fig.\n2B). In contrast, the OE rats exhibited more linear\ngeometry of fibrous tissue and reduced abundance of\ncollagen fibers (Fig. 2B). These data are consistent with\nthe hypothesis that exercise training blunts or reverses\nremodeling, collagen accumulation, and fibrosis in the\naging heart.\nTo determine whether lower levels of collagen and\nfibrous tissue in the aging heart were related to a\nreduced signal for synthesis, we tested the hypothesis\nthat exercise training would reduce collagen type I\nmRNA. If habitual exercise reverses age-related increases\nin collagen production, then it would be ex-\npected to reduce gene expression of collagen type I in\nold rats. However, we found that collagen gene expression\nwas in fact lower in hearts of old rats overall\ncompared with young rats (Fig. 2C). In addition, both\nexercise groups expressed less collagen mRNA than the\nYS group (Fig. 2C) suggesting reduced signal for collagen\nsynthesis in response to exercise.\nExercise training effects on MMP dysregulation in the\naging heart\nIf exercise exhibits its protective effects in the hearts of\nold rats by modulating collagen degradation rather\nthan synthesis, then an effect on MMP activation is\nexpected. Therefore, we sought to determine whether\nthe protective effect of exercise training against agerelated\ncollagen accumulation and fibrosis could be\nrelated to changes and regulation MMPs. Protein expression\nfor MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and\nMMP-14 was assessed in LV samples. Pro-, cleaved (i.e.,\nactive) MMP forms were measured, in the soluble and\nECM fractions.

Exercise\ntraining resulted in an increase in pro-MMP-2 (\x0b20%)\nin the old age group, while MMP-2 levels were 11%\nlower in YE compared with YS rats.

Soluble MMP-14 protein expression was significantly\nlower (\x0625%) in LVs from OS rats compared\nwith YS counterparts (Fig. 4C). Exercise training significantly\nameliorated age-associated diminishment of\nMMP-14. Indeed, soluble MMP-14 was 23% greater in\nOE compared with OS hearts (Fig. 4C). MMP-14 in the\nconnective tissue fraction was also 40% lower in LV\nsamples from OS rats. However, exercise training resulted\nin a 43% elevation of MMP-14 protein expres-\nsion in the ECM fraction in the OE group (Fig. 4D). In\ncontrast, exercise training had no effect on ECM\nMMP-14 in the YE group.\nTo determine whether exercise training might modulate\nan up-regulation of MMPs in LVs from OE rats, we\ntested the hypothesis that exercise training would\ndown-regulate TIMPs. Specifically we measured potential\nchanges in TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4 as\na function of age and exercise training in LV.

No significant effect of exercise was observed in\nthe YE group. While a trend was observed toward a\nreduction (\x0626%) in TIMP-2 protein expression (Fig.\n5B) in response to exercise training in LV samples from\nold FBNF1 rats, neither age nor exercise effects\nreached statistic significance. No significant differences\nin TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 protein expression were noted\nas a result of age and exercise training (data not\nshown).\nGiven that the TIMP-1 appears to be a target of aging\nand might confer beneficial effects of exercise training\nvia regulation of MMPs, we sought to test upstream\nmodulation of TIMP-1. Transforming growth factorbeta\n(TGF-\x021) is an upstream regulator of TIMP-1 and\nfibrosis (40). Therefore, we hypothesized that exercise\ntraining would ameliorate age-related up-regulation of\nTGF-\x021 protein levels in the rat LV. TGF-\x021 levels in\nthe LV were indeed 95% higher in OS rats compared\nwith the YS group (Fig. 5C). However, LV TGF-\x021 levels\nwere 28% lower in OE rats that had undergone 12 wk of\nexercise training compared with the OS group. In\ncontrast, no significant exercise effect for TGF-\x021 was\nobserved in the YE group. A model of a prospective\nsignaling pathway whereby exercise training protects\nagainst age-induced fibrosis is presented in Fig. 6.\nMyofibroblasts are a differentiated cell type of fibroblast\nproduced from progenitor cells in the heart of\ncirculation in response to cytokines, TGF-\x021, and inflammatory\nmediators (41, 42). Myofibroblasts are prev-\nalent with increased ECM remodeling and protein\nsynthesis, often related to wound healing, scar tissue\nformation, and growth (42). We, therefore, used\n\x08-smooth muscle actin (\x08-SMC) as a marker of myofibroblast\nexpression (43) in the aging heart to determine\nwhether exercise training reduces myofibroblast proliferation.\nHowever, we found that no significant exercise or\nage effects for \x08-SMC protein expression in the FBNF1\nheart, suggesting that suppression of myofibroblast proliferation\nis not a mechanism of exercise protection.\nDISCUSSION\nOur results demonstrate that 12 wk of exercise training\nin FBNF1 rats significantly ameliorates aging-associated\nincreases in extramyocyte space and collagen-positive\nstaining.

These\nresults are consistent with the hypothesis that habitual\nexercise training attenuates age-associated collagen\ntype-I accumulation and fibrosis through a signaling\npathway that reduces MMP dysregulation through\nTIMP-1 and TGF-\x021. Indeed, this is the first report to\nidentify potential amelioration of fibrosis in the aged\nheart by alleviating dysregulation of MMP signaling. A\ndiscussion of the primary findings follows.\nCollagen accumulation, advanced glycation end product\n(AGE)-related cross-linking, and fibrosis with aging\nare progressive and associated with reduced cardiac contractility\nand risk of heart failure (30). Elevation in fibrotic\nconnective tissue might lead to decreased cardiac compliance\nand impaired diastolic function, therefore increas-\ning the risk of heart failure cited with aging (30, 44).\nPreviously, we demonstrated that exercise training reduces\nextramyocyte space in the aging Fischer-344 rat\nstrain (37). Here, we observed substantial increases in\ntotal collagen staining, collagen type I-positive staining,\nfibrosis, and decreased linearity of the collagen network\nwith aging in the heart in FBNF1 rats. Together, these\nfindings are consistent with increases in cardiac collagen\ntype I abundance as an integral part of ECM remodeling\nin response to the aging process (6, 9, 14).\nExercise training protection against fibrosis and\naltered cardiac function with aging\nConsistent with our hypothesis, we found direct evidence\nthat exercise training attenuates or reverses\ncollagen accumulation, using 3 imaging techniques:\nMasson’s trichrome, collagen type I-specific IHC, and\nNLOM. In addition, attenuation of ECM space and\nfibrosis by exercise training was directly related to a\nreduction in collagen, and specifically collagen type I.\nReduction in alinearity and amelioration by exercise\ntraining of the weblike geometry characteristic of aging\nwas consistent across imaging approaches and dramatic.\nThis is the first study to visualize the protective\neffects of chronic exercise on geometric remodeling of\ncollagen that occurs in the aging heart. Our invasive,\nvisual evidence of amelioration of collagen and ECM\nremodeling by exercise training in the aging heart\nusing NLOM, Masson’s trichrome, and collagen type I\nstaining is novel and relevant to potential improvement\nof cardiac function.\nAging alters the geometry of connective tissue, decreasing\nlinearity of collagenous myocyte sheaths and\nconnective tissue in the heart (9, 16, 17).

We previously\nfound that much of the remodeling of the aging\nheart occurs toward the endocardial surface (37), important\nbecause greater sliding of myocyte sheaths\nmagnifies mechanical stress when impeded (16, 45).\nSubstantial reductions of fibrosis, collagen type I accumulation,\nand alinearity by exercise training were con-\nsistent across imaging techniques. Increased linearity of\nthe collagen network by exercise training may reduce\ninternal work of the aging heart, thus lessening metabolic\nand blood flow requirements, reducing fibrosis,\nalleviating arrhythmias, suppressing excess apoptosis, as\nwell as improving function (14, 19, 37).\nPrevious studies have used biochemical methods to\nexplore the efficacy of exercise training to reduce\ncollagen abundance, HP cross-linking, and alterations\nin collagen gene expression. Woodiwiss et al. (46)\nfound that 16 wk of habitual voluntary wheel running\nreduced cardiac stiffness in young rats, without a significant\nchange in collagen or collagen cross-linking.\nConsistently, we also found no significant changes in\ncollagen-positive imaging with exercise training in\nyoung rats. Thomas et al. (6, 29) reported that 10 wk of\nexercise training reduced collagen cross-linking in the\nhearts of old Fischer-344 rats, but not in young rats. In\na follow-up study, the abundance of collagen per unit\ndry weight was significantly reduced in the hearts of old\nFischer-344 rats (29). Recently, Choi et al. (30) found\nthat exercise training protected against a decline in\nsystolic function, related to an attenuation of decreased\nsolubility of collagen. A mechanism related to lower\nAGEs was proposed. Long-term exercise training in the\naging heart may mimic the cardioprotective effects\nobserved with preconditioning and caloric restriction\n(47), potentially linked to up-regulation of mitochondrial\nstress proteins (e.g., MnSOD) and reduced oxida-\ntive stress (48).\nStudies in human patients suggest a protective role of\nexercise training on cardiac function, compliance, and,\nin some cases, diastolic filling. Improvement in diastolic\nfunction with exercise training in human studies has\nbeen recorded (49, 50). Arbab-Zadeh et al. (44) reported\nthat subjects participating in habitual exercise,\nwith an average age of 70, have significantly less diastolic\ndysfunction and reduced stiffness during diastole.\nPrasad et al. (51) found partial protection against\nage-related abnormalities in filling and relaxation with\nlifelong exercise. In contrast, Nottin et al.

Recent findings reviewed by\nTanaka and Seals (50) demonstrate that master athletes\nmaintain high cardiovascular function, including compliance\nand stroke volume, at exceptionally high levels\nuntil their 70s. Thus, it is believed that habitual exercise\nmay protect heart function by slowing some of ageinduced\nmechanical remodeling (27, 53).\nExercise alleviation of age-related dysfunction of\nMMPs\nMMPs catalyze degradation of ECM proteins. However,\ndysregulation of MMPs is now believed to contribute to\nfibrosis, aging, and heart failure (21, 22, 54). Fedak et\nal. (21) reported that human heart failure is associated\nwith a large up-regulation of TIMP-1. However, ischemia\nreperfusion acutely activates MMPs (55). This\napparent discrepancy can be explained by differential\nregulation between aging and hypertension, where\nMMP activity decreases with aging and increases with\nhypertension (56). Thus hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion,\nand heart failure might exhibit acute up-regu-\nlation of MMPs, potentially related to scar tissue formation\n(56). Here, we noted that while the proforms of\nMMPs either increased (MMP-3) or decreased (MMP14)\nwith advancing age, the active and ECM forms were\nconsistently reduced by aging (Figs. 3 and 4). These\ndata are consistent with the hypothesis that impaired\nturnover of ECM proteins might be an important\ncontributory mechanism of accumulation of fibrotic\ntissue in the heart due to aging.\nIn our study, exercise training consistently up-regulated\nactive and ECM fraction MMPs, including MMP-1,\nMMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-14, mitigating age-related\nreduction in MMP expression (Figs. 3 and 4). These are\nhighly novel findings that are consistent with a signaling\npathway involving MMP regulation eliciting the\nprotective effects of ET against remodeling, collagen\naccumulation, and fibrosis. MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3,\nand MMP-14 can serve as collagenases and degrade a\nhost of ECM proteins, including aggrecan (MMP-1,\nMMP-2, and MMP-3), fibronectin (MMP-2, MMP-3, and\nMMP-14), laminin (MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-14), and\ngelatin (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-14) (10, 18,\n57). Elevation of TIMP-1 we observed with aging (Fig.\n5A) was indeed consistent with upstream suppression of\nactive and ECM fraction forms of MMP-1, MMP-2,\nMMP-3, and MMP-14. Furthermore, exercise training\nsubstantially reduced TIMP-1 in concert with up-regulation\nof MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-14. Indeed,\nThomas et al. (22) reported a significant up-regulation\nin TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 as a result of heart failure in rats.\nFedak et al. (21) postulated that elevation of TIMP-1\nand reduction in TIMP-3 contributed to human heart\nfailure. Further, Bonnema et al. (13) found that aging\nincreased TIMP-1, TIMP-4, and MMP-2 profiles, while\nMMP-9 was lower in the old human heart. Given that\nTIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4 were not responsive to\nexercise training, these data imply that a TIMP-1/MMP\npathway is a viable candidate pathway of exercise protection\nagainst age-related fibrosis. In addition, TIMP-1\nis revealed as a target candidate for therapeutic development.\nExercise training also mitigated age-associated up-\nregulation of TGF-\x021 in the LV (Fig. 5C). TGF-\x021 is a\npotent stimulator of TIMP-1 and a potential contributor\nto fibrosis in the aging heart (13, 25, 40). Our data\ntherefore indicate that alleviation of a signaling cascade\ninvolving TGF-\x021, TIMP-1, and MMPs might be an\nimportant mediator of exercise protection against fibrosis\nas a result of aging. Given increased agreement\nof the role of TGF-\x021 in fibrosis with aging and in the\netiology of heart failure (40), the potency of exercise\ntraining in attenuating TGF-\x021 protein expression has\nimportant clinical relevance.\nWe found that exercise training reduced collagen\ntype I mRNA in the LVs from young rats, but not old\n(Fig. 2C). This finding was directly related to a downward\naging effect in collagen type I gene expression.\nIndeed, no significant differences were found in Col I\nmRNA among YE, OS, and OE groups. This is consistent\nwith the notion that aging suppresses collagen I\nproduction in the heart, rather than elevating synthesis.\nIn addition, exercise training was not effective at altering\ncollagen I gene expression in the hearts of old rats\n(Fig. 2C). Previously, Thomas et al. (6) reported that\nexercise training reduced the decline in LV mRNAs for\ncollagen type I and collagen type III in middle-aged\nrats. However, they found that exercise was less effective\nin alleviating reduction of collagen mRNAs in senescent\nrats. Together, these data are inconsistent with the\nnotion that exercise confers protection against fibrosis\nand collagen accumulation in the aging heart via a\nreduction in protein synthesis for type I collagen.\nFigure 6. Integrative signaling model based on our results,\nindicating prospective targets for exercise training in modulating\nMMPs and fibrosis.\n1115EXERCISE, FIBROSIS AND MMP REGULATION IN THE AGING HEART\n', 'The lack of response of a myofibroblast marker\n(\x08-SMC) to exercise and age also indicates that reduction\nin scar tissue formation was not a likely mechanism\nof exercise protection in the aged heart. Therefore, it is\nincreasingly likely that exercise protection observed in\nthe current study was related to alterations in pathway\nsignaling (e.g., MMPs–TIMP-1–TGF-\x021) that elevate\ncollagen and ECM protein degradation.\nClinical relevance\nThe clinical importance of habitual exercise in the\nprotection of cardiac function and health is profound.\nPhysical inactivity, similar to aging, results in diminished\ncardiac function and exacerbates the risk of heart\ndisease (58). Indeed, inactivity appears to accelerate\ncardiac aging, and is a major determinant in the\nreduction in cardiac function in older adults (26, 27,\n59). Exercise training has been shown to improve\nmaximal aerobic capacity and heart function in older\npopulations, related to improvement in mechanical\nproperties (50). Exercise training also protects against\nfuture damage, up-regulation of type I collagen, apoptosis,\nand impaired mechanical function related to myocar-\ndial infarction (60). Notably, exercise training appears to\nretain its ability to reduce muscle damage, apoptosis,\nimpaired contractile function, and altered mechanical\nproperties as a result of ischemia/reperfusion injury (26,\n61, 62). Lack of an intermediate age group is a study\nlimitation that would establish age-related changes as true\naging effects, and would identify a potential threshold for\nfibrosis. Continued investigation into the mechanisms of\nexercise protection is vital, and will identify therapeutic\ntargets to mitigate fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, and\nheart failure prevalent with advancing age.\nFunding for this study was provided by support from the\nAmerican Heart Association (0555064Y, 0855158F), the U.S.\nNational Institutes of Health (AR054084), and the Sydney\nand J.
