        <pre>['THE EUREKA SENTINEL\nESTABLISHED 1870. EUREKA, NEVADA, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 28. 1908. PUBLISHED SATURDAYS.\nThe Independent Vote\nAmong the gratifying features of the election is the increased\ntendency shown everywhere townrds independent voting. The\n"vote ’er straight” idea is losing its strength, and at every election\nwhere bad measures or bad conditions are a factor the scratched\nballot vote increases. Conversely, also, good men and measures\nare scratched by the bad element in the same way, but as the good\nelement largely exceeds the bad everywhere, the balance is on the\nright side of the ledger. The difference between the vote for\nPresident and Governor in Indiana, Ohio, New York, Minnesota,\nMissouri, North Dakota, Oregon and other States shows how strong\na hold independence of party in voting has secured. Even in the\nSouth, where the ever present necessity for maintaining white\nsupremacy acts as a barrier to independent voting, the tendency to\nbreak away from party control is manifesting itself.\nPerhaps, in the interest of decency and as a gratifying evidence\nof an improved moral tone, the election of Judge Dunne in San\nFrancisco is the most important of the minor manifestations of this\ntendency, says the 8t. Louis Star. Judge Dunne is the jurist who\ntook such a firm stand in his court in the matter of the prosecution\nof Abe lluef, Mayor Eugene Schmitz aud the other grafters of San\nFrancisco. Neither threats nor bribes could move him, while other\njudges were as spineless as jelly fish. Judge Dunne was re-elected,\nthe only successful man on the Democratic ticket. Though strongly\nopposed by the lawless element of his own party, enough of the\nbetter element of the other party scratched their tickets and voted\nfor him to elect him, thus disproving the assertions often made by\nthe graft politicians of both sides that the people of San Francisco\nwere not in sympathy with the efforts of Heney and Spreckles to\nprosecute the grafters. In New York the gambling and sporting\nektuent, very large in so great a State and city, opposed Mr.\nHughes, aided by the graft forces in the Republican machine, whom\nHughes had put out of business, but enough of the good men of the\nDemocratic party scratched their ballots in his favor to prevent the\nscratching of the gamblers and grafters from defeating him. It is\nneedless to particularize further. The day of the independent\nvoter has come, and political parties, or party managers must reckon\nwith him.\nWhile our whole political and election system is founded upon\nparty organizations, and while such organizations are necessary and\nloyalty to them desirable, the blind worship of party and the\nthoughtless, careless or reckless voting of party tickets is the basis\nof nearly all the political corruption from which the country suffers.\nUnder such conditions a minority of active manipulators always\ncontrols the party. Had candidates, bad measures, bad everything,\nare the result We have seen its workings in St Louis under both\nDemocratic and Republican administrations. The ability of corrupt\nparty bosses to nominate their equally corrupt tools for office has\nbeen largely curtailed by the primary system of nominations, and\ntheir election of them has been rendered far more difficult than\nformerly by the Australian ballot system, registration of voters and\nthe growing habit of independent voting, the latter being the most\nimportant and efficacious of all.\nWhen the party brand shall no longer serve to elect bad men\nor carry bad measures, when bad laws must run the gauntlet of the\nReferendum, political bosses will be shorn of much of their power\nfor harm, parties will have to be careful whom they select for\ncandidates and what measures their representatives support in\nCongress, State Legislatures and City Councils, and officials will\nhave to recognize their duty to the public as superior to their\nallegiance to a boss. The day of the party name as a fetich is\npassing.\nTke Promise of Postal Savings Banks\nThe Literary Digest: Postmaster-General Meyer’s confident\nprediction that “March 4 will see postal savings banks a reality” in\nthe United States has attracted less editorial notice than might\nhave been expected. As Mr. Meyer says, not only has the project\nbeen indorsed by the Republican platform, but a day has already\nbeen set by the Senate for the consideration of a bill dealing with\nthis subject which was prepared by the Senate Committee last year.\nThe New York World points out, moreover, that Mr. Taft, by state\nments made since his election, is “emphatically committed” to the\nestablishment of these institutions for safeguarding the small\nsavings of the people.\nIt is estimated that postal savings banks would put into circula\ntion many hundreds of millions of dollars that are now hoarded in\nsmall sums. Such additional circulation, it is urged, would be an\nenormous factor in recalling prosperity to the country. The postal\nsavings bank plan provides that any person more than ten years old\nmay have a deposit of any sum between $1 and $500, which shall\ndraw two per cent interest The postmasters shall deposit these\nsavings in the United States bauks in their communities, which\nBhall allow to the Government 2.5 per cent By this method the\nmoney will go into circulation in the communities where it is saved,\nand its safety will be guaranteed by the Government Of the need\nof postal savings banks the World\'s Work says :\n“In the Pacific States the average distance that men have to go\nto reach any bank is 55 miles; in the Southern States, 33 miles; in\nthe Middle States, 25 miles. This is, of course, a prohibitive dis\ntance. In the New England States, where savings banks are ac\ncessible to most of the population, they have deposits of more than\na billion and a quarter dollars—more than in all the rest of the\nUnion except New York. There is no doubt that accessible and\nsafe depositories for savings in every part of the country—and only\npostal savings banks, of couise, can be made so accessible—would\nput many hundreds of millions of dollars into circulation that is\nnow hoarded in small Bums, and this is enough money to make an\nenormous difference to the prosperity of the country.\n“During the last fiscal year more than seventy-to millions were\nsent abroad by postal money orders only; and it is known that much\nof this was sent for deposit in foreign postal savings banks."\nEvery English family has at least one weak-minded member,\naccording to a London medical magazine.\nThe Government of Bombay is urging the natives to plant tapioca\nin place of rice to prevent the famines due to drouth, as it is not so\ndependent upon moisture for its growth as is the grain.\nNevada Democracy May Win Favor\nGoldfield Chronicle : The Democracy of the State has resolvet’\nto maintain its organization pending another campaign, in order tc\nlie lietter able to meet the enemy when next election day comes. It\nis an excellent idea, but the Chronicle has a better one—give the\npeople good government, wise legislation and justice for the next\ntwo years and there will be no difficulty in maintaining a hold upon\nNevada.\nGive the people beneficial laws, safeguarding them against\ntheft by men in high places.\nGive the school children free text books in our public schools,!\nthereby aiding in educating our future citizens.\nGive the legitimate prospector and mine operator protection\nfrom the wiid-cat schemer.\nGive the people the initiative and Referendum, bringing closer\nto the masses the powers of government.\nGive the people the direct primary, and thus put out of\nbusiness the corrupt political boss.\nThe Democratic party in Nevada will be held responsible for\nall errors at the forthcoming session of the Legislature. The party\nis in absolute control. It has the power to act, and if it so ad\nministers the laws as to do justice to all men the party will be\nmaintained. But if it becomes lax or overbearing in its strength\nthe people will so record their verdict at the next election that\norganization will not profit any party.\nLet every citizen see that the people rule!\nNewest Notes of Science\nThere are 13 recognized quali-l\nties of meerschaum.\nSouthern California yields 2000\ntons of salt each year.\nA Dutch syndicate with $2,412,\n000 capital has been formed to\ncontrol the quinine industry of\nJava.\nMexico’s coal fields cover about\n300,000 acres, and produce an\naverage of 3000 tons per acre each\nyear.\nNine-tenths of the world’s\nannual production of 2,000,000\ntons of sugar comes from the\nsugar cane.\nAlthough coal has been found\nin nearly every one of the\nPhilippine islands, but 4,545 tons\nwere mined last year.\nAt an altitude of 8500 feet 25\nper cent of the power of a gasoline\nmotor is lost, owing to the de\ncreased atmospheric pressure.\nRecent examinations of concrete\nsubject to the action of locomotive\ngases for 13 years showed that it\nhad not been affected by them.\nA score of years ago Germans\nintroduced the shell button in\ndustry into Japan. Now Japan\nis exporting buttons to Germany.\nThe Chinese have a method of\ndepriving castor oil of its medic\ncinal properties so that it may bo\nused for ordinary culinary pur\nposes.\nAbout 2500 acres of abandoned\nfarms in New England have been\nplanted in trees this year as a\npart of a general reforestation\nscheme.\nA Massachusetts man has been\ngiven a patent on a spring clip\nwith which new seats may be\nattached to chairs with a minimum\nof labor.\nThe largest coral reef in the\nworld is the Great Barrier, off\nthe northern coast of Australia.\nIt is 1000 miles loDg and, in\nplaces, 30 miles wide.\nThe Italian Government has\nordered 300,000 reinforced con\ncrete railroad ties, made by a\nrecently patented formula, for\nexperimental purposes.\nA big baking firm in Cape\nColony has imported an American\nplant, with up-to-date machinery,\nto use imported flour, in oppo\nsition to bakers controlled by the\nmillers of that country.\nAustralian dairy interests will\nsave about 1200,000 a year here\nafter by the adoption of a new\nform of strawboard box instead\nof wooden ones in which to ship\nproducts to England\nNine-tenths of the steel ties\nlaid by the Mexican railway in\n1884 are still in good condition,\nas a recent examination showed.\nThey were laid in gravel, coarse\nsand, or fine stone.\nThe world’s most powerful\ndredge, recently completed in\nBelgium from an American’s de\nsigns, for the Russian Govern\nment, can remove 7000 cubic\nyards of earth from a river bottom\nin an hour.\nA prospector for gold in Alaska\nfound a hot spring but 125 miles\nsouth of the Arctic circle, and\nhas made a fortune by raising\nfresh vegetables on probably the\nmost northerly truck farm in the\nworld.\nBASEBALL STORM BREWING.\nWashington and Chicago American\nPlayers May Be “Outlawed."\nThere la liable to l>e plenty stirring\nin baseball before the big teams line\nup for one another\'s gore next spring.\nIt has been an unusually peaceful sum\nmer, hut the calm always precedes the\nstorm. Already one sees fomenting In\nthe pot little bits of trouble that are\nliable to precipitate a storm before the\nend of the year. The situation which\nconfronts the Washington American\nteam may force the Issue.\nWashington is In serious difficulty.\nThis Is shown by the stand of the nn\ntloual commission in temporarily black\nlisting those Senators who played with\nout permission against Jimmy Calla\nhan\'s I.ogan Squares of Chicago. Mem\nl>ers of the Chicago Americans are in\npractically the same boat, as some of\nFielder Jones’ athletes also tried con\nclusions with the outlaws. The com\nmission has not yet dealt with the Sox.\nhut their case will in all probability\ncome up at the next meeting of the\nboard.\nOf course the offense of Chicago is\nnot as grave as that of the Senators,\nas fewer Sox players took part In the\ngames, and they did not leave their\nown territory nor play In opposition to\nthe world\'s series. Should the commis\nsion wish to make an example of\nWashington, however. It will mean a\nbig shakeup In the American league.\nWith all the Senators who took part\nblacklisted, the promising looking ag\ngregation with which Cantlllon made\nsuch a strong finish last fall would be\nshattered. Cantlllon Is pretty strong\nwith the Washington fans, and they\nare liable to stick behind the manager.\nAt any rate, this town has stood\nenough In the line of tail enders. It\nwould not want to be In any way\ncheated out of n chance for Improve\nment.\nBan Johnson win got joe < nnuiiou s\nscalp If there Is any possibility. Now\ncomes the breath of scandal that stout\nJoe accuses bis players of "laying\ndown” to Detroit In the concluding se\nries with Cleveland, but Johnson is re\nported to have said that he would make\nCautllloo substantiate the charges or\ngot out of the league. Ban Is Just now\non a shooting trip In Wisconsin with\nCharlie Comiskcy and other magnates,\nand tlie matter is not likely to he aired\nuntil the annual league meeting in De\ncember.\nGood Year For Pacer*.\nThis Is an unusual year for sensa\ntional pacers. In fact, while there are\nsome remarkable trotters out. It might\nlie called a pacing year, as there has\nseldom If ever been a season where\nthere were so many high class pacers\non the big circuits as now. At Detroit\nDan Patch made his first start of the\nseason In an attempt to beat hts mark;\nbut, while he failed to do so, he paced\na mile In 1:58%, which was certainly\nfast enough to keep him from catching\ncold while en route. Then Minor Heir\npaced a mile In 1:50% at the Milwau\nkee track, which is surely a great per\nformance for a five-year-old stallion\nthe first year out.\nOn the grand circuit nre a few pacers\nthat hare been keeping the followers\nof the caravan constantly on the anx\nious seat this year by their speed. The\nEel (2:02%) bus the fastest mark, but\nhad not Dan McEwen staked his gray\npacer right through the grand circuit\nIt la safe to say that he would have a\nfaster mark than that right now. The\nEel has had easy sailing in the stakes,\nbut were he to bump up against the\nfree-for-allers, which Include Hedge\nwood Bay (2:03%), Baron Grattan\n(203%), Gallagher (203%). John A.\n(2:03%* and some others, the pace\nwould have been so hot that some new\nrecords would have been hung out.\nA MOTHER NOW.\nCountess Szechenyi, Who Has Pre\nsented Count With a Daughter.\nThe Countess Szechenyi, who has\npresented her bnsband. Count Laszlo\nSzechenyi, with a daughter, was mnr\nrted to hlin last January at the Van\nderbilt mansion In New York, and the\nwedding was the great event of the\nsocial season. As Miss (Gladys Van\nderbilt the countess was quite pop\nular with the members of the smart\nset. nnd It Is reported that she has\nendeared herself much to the people\nupon the big estate of her husband In\nHungary, to many of whom an Amer\nican woman Is something of a cu\nriosity. The mother of the countess Is\nwith her.

But a Legislature may provide\ndifferently. In 1876 the Colorado Legislature chose the State\nelectors. Mr. Thomas Watson said the other day that under the\nlaws of Georgia if no ticket receives a majority in Georgia the choice\nof electors is thrown into the Legislature. In 1892 Michigan voted\non its electors by congressional districts.\nHow do States sometimes split their electoral votes?\nOccasionally a popular elector will receive enough com\nplimentary votes to elect him even if his fellows on the ticket are\ndefeated. Sometimes mistakes in marking ballots will result in a\ndivided electoral vote in a close State.\nWhat determines the date of the National election ?\nIn 1845 Congress prescribed that it be held on the Tuesday\nafter the first Monday in November. Before that time some of the\nStates held elections on different days.\nDoes a plurality in the electoral colleges elect ?\nNo. The constitution provides that if no candidate shall\nreceive a majority of the electoral votes the election shall be thrown\ninto the House, the three highest candidates only being voted on.\nHow does the House vote ?\nIt votes by States, a majority of the members from each State\ncasting its vote.\nHas au election ever been thrown into the House ?\nYes, twice. In 1800 when Jefferson was elected, and in 1824,\nwhen John Quincy Adams became President.\nCan a man be elected President by a minority of the popular\nvotes?\nY\'es. In 1824 Andrew Jackson had a plurality of 50,000 over\nJ. Q. Adams, and in 1888 Grover Cleveland had a plurality of nearly\n100,000 over Benjamin Harrison.\nIs there any justification for election by States rather than by\ndirect popular vote ?\nYes. Election by States is probably fairer to the country as a\nwhole. Otherwise some limited section of the country would\nacquire undue influence. Thus the manufacturing State of Penn\nsylvania may give as huge a Republican vote as it pleases, but it\ncan deliver only 34 electoral votes. Under the present system, no\nPresident can be chosen who has not supporters in about half the\nStates of the Union.\nIDOL OF JAPANESE.\nHaro of Sea of Japan, the Modeat Ad\nmiral Count Togo.\nAdmiral Count Togo, who has been |\nJapan\'s Idol ever since his victory over\nthe fleet of Rojestvensky In the sea of\nJapan, gave a reception on his flag\nship, the Mlkasa, to the officers of\nthe American fleet on the arrlvul In\nJapanese waters.

Our lads swept the boards in\nthe Olympic games In the stadium at\nShepherd\'s Bnsb. Jnst outside of Lon\ndon. and now comes the Information\nthat an American built and designed\nmotor boat has defeated the much\npraised English craft of this class in\nthe races for the International cham\npionship.\nThe races took place off Huntington\n1 bay, I.ong Island, and, although five\nI mats started, from the very out\nset it was seen that the result of the\naquatic combat would be determined\nby the Dixie II.. representing the\nI\'nlted States, and the Wolseley Sid\ndeiey, owned by the Duke of W est\nniinster, who ts one of the most enthu\nsiastic motor boat racers In all Britain. ,\nThe Dixie II. won for the stars and\nstripes by no less than forty-nine sec\nonds, a crushing defeat when It is con\nsidered how far n racing motor boat\ncan travel In this time. She traveled\nthrough the water at the rate of over\ntwenty-eight knots an hour, or, accord\ning to the landsman\'s way of reckon\ning. she went over thirty-two statute\nmiles an hour. In the words of the\nhorsemen, “that\'s going some, and a\nlittle bit more.”\nMuch of the credit for the sensa\ntional performance of the Dixie II.\ngoes to Captain S. Barclay t’earce.\nCAPTAIN 8.

He fell senseless alongside of\nthe swiftly pounding machinery, and\nCaptain l’earee was forced to run the\nengines as well as to govern the\ncourse of the craft until the engineer\nregained his senses. The fact that\nthe Dixie II. won the race in spite of\nthis accident and handicap goes to ac\ncentuate the high quality of Yankee\npiuc-k, perseverance and ingenuity.\nEngland had another competitor In\nside the Dixie II.
