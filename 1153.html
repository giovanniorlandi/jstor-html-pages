        <pre>['Experimentalism and American Education \nJOHN L. CHILDS \nPROFESSOR OF EDUCATION, TEACHERS COLLEGE \n \nIN his recent book, Education Between Two \nWorlds, Alexander Meiklejohn states that \nJohn Dewey and his pragmatic colleagues \nhave "dominated, during the last fifty years, \nthe theory and practice of American \neducation." Although this tribute from a critic \nexaggerates the influence of this philosophy \non actual school practice, no candid \nobserver can deny that, since the turn of the \ncentury, pragmatism, or experimentalism, \nhas played an important part in the \ndevelopment of American thought and \neducation. Seldom in the whole course of \nWestern history has a new philosophical \norientation exerted such an immediate and \npervasive influence in the intellectual, \npolitical, and educational affairs of its \nsociety. \n \nExperimentalism has evoked this broad, \npopular response, not because it is a \n"popular" philosophy in the sense that its \ninsights are superficial. On the contrary, its \nleading ideas are now almost universally \nregarded by scholars as having important \nand lasting worth. No account of the \nintellectual developments of the modern \nperiod can ignore the contributions of the \nfounders of experimentalism—Peirce, \nJames, Mead, and Dewey. The late \nSupreme Justice Holmes, a lifelong student \nof the history of philosophy, once declared: \n"I have profound respect for Professor \nDewey. ... It seems to me that his insight \ninto the movement of the universe as it \nshows itself to men goes to as high a point \nas has ever been reached by articulate \nspeech." Dewey has frequently affirmed that \nhis own work was made possible because of \nthe foundations provided by the \ncontributions of his colleagues—Peirce, \nJames, and Mead. The brilliant analyses \nthese four leaders have made of many \nclassical problems have long been a source \nof aesthetic enjoyment for the technical \nspecialists in philosophy and have given \nthem new intellectual perspectives of the \nutmost importance. \n \nAnd yet to a remarkable degree, \nexperimentalism is the philosophy of the \ncommon man. Santayana "was correct \nwhen he observed that it might even be \ncharacterized as a layman\'s religion. \nExperimentalism has succeeded in thus \nserving the interests of the common man as \nwell as those of the technical philosopher \nbecause of its deep respect for the affairs \nand procedures of ordinary human \nexperience. For the experimentalist a child is \nas evidential of the nature of nature as an \nelectron; the activities of a schoolroom are \nas valid subject matter for philosophy as the \nmovements of the heavenly bodies. The \nexperimentalist also believes that philosophy \nwill enjoy vitality only so long as it \nremembers "that all intellectual terms are \nthe products of discrimination and \nclassification, and that we must, as \nphilosophers, go back to the primitive \nsituations of life that antecede and generate \nthese reflective interpretations." \n \nMore fundamentally, experimentalism has \nevoked a wholehearted response from the \nAmerican people, because it has dealt with \ndeep-moving tendencies in the life of the \nnew world. Its formulations have also \ncommanded attention because-they have \nbeen concerned with problems that are \ncentral in the ongoing life and thought of the \nmodern man. For example: \n \nExperimentalism has accepted, without \ndiscount, the evolutionary account of man\'s \ngenesis. It has sought to define the \nimplications of this bio-social view of human \ndevelopment for traditional beliefs about the \nnature and conduct of man. It has pioneered \nin the construction of a theory which has \nsought to eliminate the traditional dualisms \nof man and nature, of mind and body, of \nsubject and object, of act and material, of \npurpose and mechanism, and of ends and \nmeans. This humanistic reconstruction has \ngiven the common man greater respect for \nhis own experience, and greater confidence \nin his own powers. \n \n', 'Experimentalism has also discerned that all \nclaims to knowledge of the true, the good, \nand the beautiful which are not sourced in, \nand tested by, the subject matters and \nprocedures of ordinary human experience \nare mere pretenses. It believes that the race \nhas reached a stage where it should no \nlonger seek refuge in pretense, and hence \nhas boldly declared that the final issue of \nphilosophy "is whether the guide and \nstandard of beliefs and conduct lie within or \nwithout the shareable situations of life." \n \nExperimentalism recognizes that any \nempirical account of existence must accept \nchange as real. It does not hesitate to draw \nthe revolutionary implication of this \nperception. It contends that it is not tradition \nand precedent, but the movement of \nexperience responding to changing \nconditions and expanding bodies of \nknowledge which should contribute the \nultimate criteria of both truth and value. \n \nExperimentalism accepts the fact that \nmeans of knowledge and of control are \nsupreme human interests. It also holds that \nout of age-long trials and failures, man has \nfinally achieved in experimental method a \nreliable means of making discoveries, of \ntesting beliefs, and of gaining control. It has \ntherefore subjected these experimental \nprocedures by which man most surely gets \nknowledge to searching analysis in order to \nlearn from them about the nature, the \nconditions, the pattern, and the controls of \nthinking. It has concluded from this firsthand \nstudy of the actual pattern of thought that \nthinking and activity are organically related, \nand that whenever thinking is more than idle \ndaydreaming, it is engaged in the work of \nconstructing possible lines of action. It holds \nthat an idea is precisely a plan of action. It \nwas Peirce who first grasped this central \nprinciple of experimental activity and \ngeneralized it in the proposition that no \ndistinction of meaning, no matter how subtle, \ncan ever be other than a possible distinction \nof practice. By thus showing the vital \ncontinuity between the world of meaning and \nthe world of practice, or action, \nexperimentalism has done much both to \ndiscipline and to liberate the intellectual life \nof man. This discovery of the "operational" \nnature of ideas, conceptions, and theories \nhas contributed a logical tool which both the \ncommon man and the research specialist \ncan and do employ to great advantage. \n \nFinally, the experimentalist was one of the \nfirst to grasp the intimate connection \nbetween democracy and intellectual \nfreedom. Special privilege in whatever \nform—ecclesiastical, military, governmental, \neconomic, or social—is the force which fears \nfreedom of inquiry and seeks to use \nauthority to curb the intellectual activities of \nman. Hence it is only in a society which \nconsciously aims at the good of all, and in \nwhich all share in making the common \npatterns of life, that intelligence can be really \nliberated. This is equivalent to saying that a \ndemocratic society is an essential condition \nfor the richest cultivation of the life of \nreason. Recognizing the importance of this \nprinciple, the experimentalist has made \ndemocracy an organic part of his \nphilosophical orientation. \n \nIt is not surprising that these leading ideas of \nthe experimentalist should have laid hold of \nthe imagination of many American- teachers \nwho were seeking to introduce the young to \na society designed to realize the principles \nof democracy, science, and a functional, as \nopposed to a leisured-class, culture. It is \nalso natural that the more adventuresome of \nthese educators should have interested \nthemselves in a movement to create a \nschool program in which these newer \nperspectives and emphases would be \norganically contained. During the past \ndecade this educational movement has \nbeen gaining in strength in all parts of the \nUnited States. \n \nSince this experimentalist outlook marks a \nsharp departure from that of the classical \nphilosophical tradition, its introduction \ninevitably arouses a certain amount of \nphilosophical opposition and criticism. \nSimilarly, since the experimentalist \neducational theories and practices conflict \nwith educational interests and routines to \nwhich teachers have long been habituated, it \nis also natural, now that these ideas are \nbeing more widely adopted, that they should \nencounter opposition from within the \neducational ranks. It is also to be expected \nthat this reactionary movement on both the \nphilosophical and educational fronts should \ngain in strength during this period of \n', 'profound social unsettlement and global \nwar. Experience shows that in a situation of \nsocial strain and uncertainty there is a \ntendency for many to seek security by \nretreat to the inherited folkways of their \ngroup. \n \nUndoubtedly, we are in the midst of such a \nwave of reaction at the present time. On the \nphilosophical front this movement back to \nthe "eternal verities" has been characterized \nby some as "a retreat from reason," or a \n"second failure of nerve." It is an effort to \nrehabilitate points of view and methods \nwhich many had supposed we had left \nbehind. \n \nOn the educational front this attack on the \nexperimentalist outlook has won the support \nof a number of eminent school and college \nleaders. Some of these educators are \nheading a movement which, when stripped \nto its essentials, asks us to supplant the \nauthority of experience with the authority of \nsupernaturalism; the processes of critical \nintelligence with the processes of feeling, \nintuition, and obedience; the method of \nverification by experiment with the method of \nverification by tradition and precedent; and \nthe process of education and growth through \npurposeful activity in life situations with \neducational processes of drill, memory, and \nclassroom recitations. \n \nHow long this reaction will continue, how \nserious its consequences will become \ncannot now be stated. Of one thing we may \nbe sure, however, this "wave of reaction" will \nnot constitute the final "wave of the future" \nunless we abandon the values of the \ndemocratic, scientific, liberal mode of life. \nExperimentalism signifies nothing more, and \nnothing less, than the effort to define and to \nformulate the presuppositions of these \nmodern movements into a thoroughgoing \nconsistent outlook on life. Hence its future is \nbound up with the fate of these movements. \nAs a philosophy and a theory and practice of \neducation it will not survive, if the effort to \norganize a civilization on the basis of a \ndemocratic, scientific, and liberal pattern \ncannot succeed; conversely, it will not die, if \nsuch a democratic, experimental, nonauthoritarian\nworld can be organized. This is \nnot to say that the present formulations of \nexperimentalism in philosophy and in \neducation signify that finality has been \nreached. Nothing could be farther from the \ntruth, or more in conflict with the spirit and \nmethod of experimentalism. One thing, \nhowever, needs to be plainly said: The task \nof creating a philosophy and an educational \nconception and practice in harmony with the \npatterns of science and democracy is the \ntask which experimentalism has \nundertaken—that task cannot be achieved \nby those who retreat from democracy and \nscience, or by those who shrink from the \ndeeper implications of these modern \nmovements. \n \nIt is in this connection that the following \nthree articles should be read. These articles \nwere written by graduate students in the \nDepartment of Social and Philosophical \nFoundations of Teachers College. These \nyounger men have been pursuing their \nstudies in philosophy and education in the \nmidst of the present philosophical and \neducational controversy. As their very able \nanalyses show, they are thoroughly at home \nwith the arguments and views of those who \nlead the attack on the experimentalist \nposition. They have studied both the \nphilosophical formulations and the \ncorrelated educational proposals of these \ncritics. They have learned from them, \nparticularly about those educational \npractices of experimentalism which have not \nas yet given due weight to certain positive \neducational values. Each concludes, \nhowever, that the larger promise lies with \nthe experimentalist, not with his critics. \nPossibly their judgment will be also the \nultimate judgment of their generation. \n']</pre>
