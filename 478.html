        <pre>["PROFESSOR FAY’S BOOK ON THE ORIGINS OF THE WAR 443\nlimited evidence he has studied and set \nforth, Professor Fay’s study of the origins \nof the World War is a work o f sterling \nworth, which gives an amazing mass of \ndetail in regard to matters people ought \nto know about. But we think that Professor \nFay has not given enough consideration to \nthe more remote causes of the war. We feel \nthat even in the period that he subjects \nto searching scrutiny he has not given a \nproper place to mass psychology. Above \nall, we are of the opinion that he has not \ntaken into account sufficiently the charac\xad\nter of the men of whom he writes and of \nthe atmosphere in which they were making \ntheir momentous decisions. Concerning \nthose who are dead and gone and whom we \nknow only from the written record of a \npast generation the historian and the\nbiographer give us the most accurate pic\xad\nture that is possible for us to have. Con\xad\ncerning those that lived in our own times \nand whom we know, we prefer to trust our \nown intuition.\nProfit and pleasure in Professor Fay’s \ngreat achievement, therefore, are mingled \nwith a certain amount of amazement that \nwe find ourselves unable to accept without \nreservation the results of his profound \nscholarship. Is it because Professor Fay \nhas not remembered that sometimes the \nletter killeth and the spirit maketh alive? \nWe do not know. We may be obtuse, but \nwe have not had removed from our mind \nthe conviction that, as far as immediate \nevents were concerned, Germany must con\xad\ntinue to bear the lion’s share of the guilt of \nprecipitating a World War in lb 14.\nII—The Revisionists Vindicated\nBy H A R R Y  E L M E R  BARNES\nP rofessor of H istorical Sociology, Sm ith  C ollege; \nA uthor of T he G enesis o f  th e W orld  W a r\nTHE final appearance o f Professor \nFay’s long-promised and eagerly \nawaited book on the responsibility \nfor the World War will doubtless constitute \nthe historical event of the year. Ever since \nthe appearance of his epoch-making articles \nin the American Historical Review in 1920, \nranking him decisively among the revision\xad\nists, it has been rumored that he was pre\xad\nparing a magisterial treatise on the causes\nof the war. Announced as in prospect from \ntime to time by other writers on the sub\xad\nject, the anticipation of this work has led \nto the development of a veritable Fay leg\xad\nend of international scope. Had Professor \nFay not from time to time contributed \nlearned and telling' articles and reviews, at\xad\ntesting to his corporeal existence, he would \nhave become literally a mythical figure—a \nsort of historiographical Bavharossa soma \ntime to appear and scatter the epic mon\xad\ngers and patriotic liars whose declaration \nof faith was embodied in Article 231 of the \nTreaty of Versailles.\nProfessor Fay has disappointed many \nand exasperated others by his deliberation \nand delay in preparing his book, but it\nwould seem that his product vindicates his \njudgment and procedure, though it might \nperhaps have been a good thing if he had \nr printed his original articles of 1920 in \nbook form as a preliminary harbinger of \nthe complete work to come later on. The \nnew documentary evidence which has ap\xad\npeared in the last four years, notably the \ndefinitive information about the Russian \nmobilization, the exposure of Serbia, the full \naccount of German policy in the Grouse \nPolitik, and the British documents bearing \non the c r is is  of 1914, has so revolutionized \nour knowledge of war responsibility that \nany book, however excellent, compiled at \nany earlier period would today be archaic. \nIt is to be doubted if Professor Fay could \nhave produced a decisively better book in \n1924 than Dr. Ewart’s Roots and Causes of \nthe Wars, 1914-1918, but Ewart’s book is \nnow almost obsolete on the crisis of 1914. \nToday only the Fi-ench, Italian and Serbian \ndocuments remain to be published, and they \ncannot materially alter the essential out\xad\nlines of the picture of war responsibility as \nconstructed by Professor Fay. The book, \nthen, possesses a finality which it could\n", '444 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1928\nnever have attained at an eai’lier date. Not \nonly is the book decisively better than it \ncould have been it executed some years \nback, but its publication is more fortunate \nand timely today than it could have been at \nany previous period. The rapidly mounting \nflood of serious and important literature on \nwar guilt has both aroused an intei’est in \nthe subject of war responsibility and also \ndeveloped some degree of tolerance for fact \nin this field of scholarship. If the book had \nbeen published in 1922 it would either have \nfallen flat or would have been fiercely at\xad\ntacked as the product of a liberal subven\xad\ntion from Haus Doom.\nWhile the real merits of the book can be \nfully appreciated only by the patient and \ninformed reader, we may state as a cate\xad\ngorical initial estimate that the book is vir\xad\ntually an amazing product, even to the one \nwho has expected more from it than any \nother writer on this subject. The reviewer \nis familial- with the literature of diplomatic \nhistory to a degree far in excess of the av\xad\nerage American historian, and he has ex\xad\namined every important book which has ap\xad\npeared in English, French, German or Ital\xad\nian on the subject of war responsibility. \nIt is his reasoned judgment that Professor \nFay’s Origins of the World War is, for a \ncombination of significance of subject-mat\xad\nter, exhaustive scholarship, objectivity of \ntone, and fearlessness of narration the most \nimpressive book which has thus far been \npublished in this realm of historiography. \nThe author is especially to be congratulated, \nfor few books have been written under con\xad\nditions more likely to impair their quality. \nThe great majority of Professor Fay’s \nclosest friends and associates in the histor\xad\nical profession desired, above all else in the \nworld, to have Professor Fay utilize his \nposition and his enterprise to discomfort \nthe revisionists and to vindicate the timid, \nthe evasive, the slothful and the somnolent. \nGreat pressure was put upon him indirectly \nto allow himself to be swayed by considera\xad\ntions other than those of historical sin\xad\ncerity and a regard for the facts, but he \nresolutely ignored such influences. He has \nproduced a work which is absolutely above \nreproach and radiates sincerity and convic\xad\ntion from cover to cover. The personal \nequation is not absent from the work, but \nno one can impeach the author’s probity or\nobjectivity. Further, it may be accurately \ndeclared to be the most powerful stroke for \nrevisionism which has thus far been deliv\xad\nered by any author. This it is, in spite of \nthe moderation in tone and the well-nigh \ncomplete absence of any controversial ten- \ndenz, for the good and sufficient reason \nthat the facts of war responsibility are al\xad\nmost exclusively revisionist facts, and Pro\xad\nfessor Fay has brought together by all odds \nthe most complete and effective array of \nfacts on the subject which has been assem\xad\nbled. The guilt clause of the Treaty of \nVersailles is now pulverized beyond the ca\xad\npacity of even a Renouvin or a Schmitt to \nrehabilitate it.\nNot less a surprise and delight than the \nhigh quality of the work is its scope and \ngeneral conception. Many had feared that \nthe book would inevitably be a disappoint\xad\nment, if, for no other reason, by the very \nfact of the late date of its appearance. \nWhen Professor Fay first published his ar\xad\nticles in 1920 few other scholars had at\xad\ntacked the problem of war guilt in an atti\xad\ntude of honesty and candor. In the last \nnine years the situation has been revolu\xad\ntionized, and now there are reputable writ\xad\ners on the question to be numbered by the \nscore. Further, there is little which a can\xad\ndid and objective student of the subject can \nsay about the crisis of 1914 which has not \nbeen said by Montgelas, Lutz, Stieve, Bran\xad\ndenburg, Fabre-Luce, Demartial, Dickinson, \nGooch, Rarbagallo, Lumbroso, Langer, \nBausman, Ewart and a host of others. To \nbe sure, there was a chance for the latest \nbook to bring things thoroughly up to date, \nbut this would constitute no epoch-making- \ncontribution in itself. If the work were to \nbe limited to the crisis of June 28-Aug. 5, \n1914, it was felt by many that the book \ncould at best say with a greater wealth of \ndetail what has been said over many times \nin the last four years.\n800 Pages on Pre-War History\nProfessor Fay has, however, sprung a \ndistinct surprise in the scope of his work. \nOut of about 1,100 pages some 800 are de\xad\nvoted to the diplomatic history of Europe \nprior to the tension, negotiations, mobiliza\xad\ntions and ultimatums which followed the \nAustrian rejection of the Serbian reply to \nthe Austrian ultimatum. The whole of the\n', "PROFESSOR FAY’S BOOK OK THE ORIGIKS OF THE WAR 445\nfirst volume is devoted to the period before \n1914, and about half of the second to the \nsetting of the Austro-Serbian impasse. As \nthere is no adequate account of the dip\xad\nlomatic history of Europe from 1870 to \n1914, with the exception of the rather spe\xad\ncialized and limited manual by Erich Bran\xad\ndenburg (Gooch’s volume being out of date \nand Langer’s as yet unpublished), it is a \nveritable godsend to have such an exhaus\xad\ntive and dependable account of the pre-war \ndiplomacy as is to be found in Professor \nFay's first volume. While few who desire \nto learn the truth will be dissatisfied in any \nserious way with Professor Fay’s second \nvolume on the 1914 crisis, it is the opinion \nof the reviewer that distinctly more enthusi\xad\nasm will be revealed over his first volume. \nIt is a more needed tome, and it is distinct\xad\nly more original and outspoken than the sec\xad\nond volume. It is decidedly less marred by \nProfessor Fay’s disinclination to be classed \nwith the advanced revisionist scholars, \nwhich constitutes the leitmotif of the second \nvolume. In short, Professor Fay- has not \nonly done what was expected of him, name\xad\nly, given us a competent account of the \nimmediate causes of the World War, but \nhe has presented us, as clear gain, with a \ngratifying surprise in the form of the best \naccount in existence of the diplomatic an\xad\ntecedents of the Sarajevo plot and the clash \nof the Great Alliances,\nHow best to devote the available space \nto an analysis and appraisal of Professor \nFay's book presents'both an enticing and a \nbaffling problem to the reviewer. The in\xad\ngenious and informed reviewer could think \nof at least a half dozen possible reviews of\n10,000 words each, which would in no sense \nduplicate one another. The present review\xad\ner believes, however, that for the readers of \nCurrent History the most useful thing will \nbe to indicate the place of the work among \nthe various contending groups or schools of \nwriters on the subject of war responsibility. \nIt would be fruitless to attempt to sum\xad\nmarize the contents of the volumes, and all \nthose worthy to know its material will want \nto examine it personally.\nEvery school of writers on war guilt will \ntry to claim the book for their position \nthrough selecting certain passages, divorced \nfrom the context and the general tenor of \nthe work. It will scarcely be necessary to\ndemonstrate that Professor Fay cannot be \nclaimed by the bitter-enders like Charles \nDowner Hazen, William Stearns Davis, Ed\xad\nward Raymond Turner, J. W. Headlam- \nMoriey, R. W. Seton-Watson, Bourgeois, \nPages and Debidour, who accept in greater \nor less part the whole complex of war-time \nfictions designed to prove the sole guilt of \nGermany. Before Professor Fay’s facts \nand exposition, such notions as the Pact of \nKonopischt, where the Kaiser and Franz \nFerdinand are supposed to have plotted the \ndivision of Europe, the Potsdam Confer\xad\nence, where the Kaiser revealed his plan to \nbathe Europe in gore, the contention that \nGermany dictated the Austrian program \nagainst Serbia and ruthlessly and arrogant\xad\nly brushed aside all diplomatic proposals, \nand the thesis that Austria weakened dur\xad\ning the last hours of the crisis and was re\xad\nluctantly forced into the war by the precipi\xad\ntate and unjustified German declaration of \nwar on Russia, possess the scientific status \nof chiropractic or the statistics employed in \npolitical campaigns. Equally unnecessary \nis it to prove that Professor Fay does not \nstand with those absurd revisionists who \ncontend that the Central Powers were inno\xad\ncent lambs, feloniously surprised by the en\xad\ncircling Powers, who were egged on by the \navarice and jealousy of Britain. The group \nwhose claims are likely to be most dan\xad\ngerous and misleading are those who may \nbe designated as the “ salvagers,” namely, \nthose who are given over to the endeavor \nto save as much of the Entente epic of \n1914-18 as can be rescued by every sort of \ndevice short of the acceptance of hopelessly \ndiscredited views and demonstrably forged \nand distorted documents. Of this group the \nmost distinguished leaders are Pierre Re- \nncuvin and Bemadottr. Schmitt, followed \neagerly by other writers like Preston Slos- \nson and M. T. Florinsky. That the asso\xad\nciation of Professor Fay with this group \nmight have some element of reason in it \nwould appear from the identification of Re- \nnouvin and Fay by Professor G. J. H. Hayes \nin the Saturday Review of Literature for \nJune 16, 1928, and from the fact that, in \nthe American Historical Review for July, \n1928, Professor Fay himself stated that he \nregarded Renouvin’s book as the best he had \nread on the subject of war guilt.\nIt is obvious that the only scientific man\xad\n", '446 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1928\nner of ascertaining Professor Fay’s posi\xad\ntion in regard to the controversy over war \nguilt is to examine his treatment of the sub\xad\nject. He regards as most important in \nbringing on the war such basic causes of \nwars as secret diplomacy, systems of alli\xad\nances, nationalism, militarism and imperial\xad\nism. Of these he holds the great contend\xad\ning systems of alliances to have been more \ninfluential than any other underlying cause \nof the outbreak of the World War. Yet \nProfessor Fay does not believe that the war \nwas inevitable, and he very specifically in\xad\njects Professor Schmitt’s fatalistic inter\xad\npretation in terms of the unavoidable clash \nof the opposing alliances. He states the \nwhole setting of the war guilt problem in \nthe following admirable fashion:\nThe writer of these lines does not believe \nthat the World War was "inevitable.”  * * * \nAfter all, the "system” of alliances was \nworked by individuals; their personal acts \nbuilt it up and caused it to explode in 1914. \nIn the discussion of the future, it will be the \nwork of the historian to explain the political, \neconomic and psychological motives which \ncaused these individuals to act as they did. \n* * * He will continue to discuss the “ re\xad\nsponsibility”  which each statesman must \nbear for acts which ultimately contributed \nto the catastrophe. (Vol. I, pp. 2-3, 546.)\nIn regard to the underlying causes of the \nWorld War, Professor Fay wisely agrees \nthat there was divided responsibility. He \ncompletely demolishes the frequent assertion \nof salvagers and timid revisionists to the \neffect that Germany was primarily respon\xad\nsible for the system of alliances or for mili\xad\ntarism in contemporary Europe. As far as \nthe period immediately preceding the war \nis concerned, Professor Fay does not hesi\xad\ntate to declare his belief that the Triple \nEntente was a greater menace to European \npeace than the Triple Alliance. The Triple \nAlliance was gradually disintegrating, while \nGermany was acting to restrain the Aus\xad\ntrian efforts to curb the Serbian menace. \nThe Triple Entente was becoming stronger \nand more closely knit, and France, while \ndesiring to keep fully informed concerning \nRussian policy, was encouraging rather than \nrestraining Slavic ambitions. His general \nconclusions on the period from 1909 to 1914 \nare candid and decisive:\nWhile Germany was thus working, on the \nwhole, to restrain Austria and lessen the \ntension in the Balkans, Russia was actively \npreparing for the “ inevitable” conflict be\xad\ntween Slavdom and Germandom, which\nwould bring about the final realization of \nRussia’s historic mission in regard to Con\xad\nstantinople and the Straits, and incidentally \nthe realization of Serbia’s ambition for a \n“ Greater Serbia”  at Austria’s expense. (Vol.\nI, p. 406.)\nIncidentally, Professor Fay disposes of \nthe contention of Dr. Heinrich Kanner and \nProfessor Schmitt that the “ key” to the war \nguilt problem is to be found in the sinister \nand secret military convention, alleged to \nhave been arranged between Moltke and \nConrad in 1908-9. He shows that such a \nconvention, virtually superseding the diplo\xad\nmatic relations existing between the civil \nGovernments of the two countries, existed \nonly in the imagination of Kanner and \nSchmitt. (Vol. I, pp. 343-4.)\nWe have not the space here to summar\xad\nize Professor Fay’s triumphal sweep down \nthe avenue of myths, laying low, one after \nanother, the most respected and treasured \ncontentions of the traditional and official \nschool. This is a task which we must re\xad\nserve for exuberant exposition in another \nplace. Suffice it to say that, as in his \njudgment of the period before the war, so \nin regard to 1914, Professor Fay holds the \nEntente the more responsible for failure \nto avert war in the July crisis:\nBy July 28 Germany had abandoned her \nhitherto uncompromising attitude, as we \nshall see later, and really began to attempt \nto exercise an increasingly strong moderat\xad\ning influence at Vienna; but France and \nEngland continued to refrain from restrain\xad\ning Russia, and Russia proceeded to the \ngeneral mobilization, which she had been \nwarned would make a European war in\xad\nevitable. (Vol. II, p. 392.)\nIn other words, in the present book Profes\xad\nsor Fay in no way retreats from his deci\xad\nsively revisionist declaration, wherewith he \nconcluded his review of the Grosse Politik \nin Die Kriegssehuldfrage for December, \n1926:\nWhile it is true that Germany, no less than \nall the ether Great Powers, did some things \nwhich contributed to produce a situation \nwhich ultimately resulted in the World War, \nit is altogether false to say that she de\xad\nliberately plotted to bring it about or was \nsolely responsible for it. On the contrary, \nshe worked more effectively than any other \nGreat Power, except England, to avert it, \nnot only in the last days of July, 1914. but \nalso in the years immediately preceding.\nT h e  D i v i s i o n  o p  R e s p o n s i b i l i t y\nIn a striking and effective chapter (Vol.\nII, Chap. VIII) Professor Fay takes up the\n', 'PROFESSOR FAY’S BOOK ON THE ORIGINS OF THE WAR 447\npivotal Entente thesis that Germany persis\xad\ntently blocked all promising efforts to pro\xad\nmote a diplomatic settlement of the crisis, \nwhile the Entente warmly supported every \nsuch attempt. Professor Fay shows conclu\xad\nsively that Germany refused only one plan, \nGrey’s proposal of a conference at which \nAustria would be outvoted. France and \nRussia likewise frowned on this scheme, \nwhich had the approval of Italy alone. Ger\xad\nmany, however, substituted for the confer\xad\nence expedient direct conversations between \nVienna and St. Petersburg, which was \nGrey’s original plan and the one he regard\xad\ned as the best of all those put forward in \n1914. Professor Fay makes it absolutely \nclear that Germany not only put more re\xad\nstraint on Austria than France and Eng\xad\nland did on Russia, but that her reaction to \ndiplomatic proposals in 1914 was more fa\xad\nvorable than that of any major State save \nEngland and Italy. When the test came in \n1914, Germany was the only State willing \nto place in jeopardy the system of alliances \nin order to preserve peace. This, it would \nseem to the reviewer, should entitle Ger\xad\nmany to stand next to Italy in oi’der of \ninnocence in 1914, England having decided \nfrom the beginning of the crisis not to take \nany step which would threaten the integrity \nof the Triple Entente, even though by sueb \na stand she would render war inevitable.\nProfessor Fay reveals at length the amaz\xad\ning rapidity of Russian military prepara\xad\ntions after July 23, the extent of Russian \nmilitary decisions before July 28, the bogus \ngesture of partial mobilization, the inde\xad\nfensible prematurity of the general mobili\xad\nzation, and the inevitability of a European \nwar once the general mobilization was or\xad\ndered. He makes it clear that Poincare en\xad\ncouraged the Russian militarists when at St. \nPetersburg in July, 1914, that he believed \nwar to be inevitable by the time that he \nreturned to France, that he worked chiefly \nto speed up the military preparations in \nFrance and Russia and to devise diplomatic \nruses and gestures, notably the ten-kilo\xad\nmeter withdrawal order, to win the support \nof the British. Professor Fay rejects con\xad\nclusively the thesis of Poincare (in Au Ser\xad\nvice de la France, Vol. IV) and Renouvin \nthat France attempted to dissuade Russia \nfrom moving ahead with the plans for gen\xad\neral mobilization, which she revealed to\nFrance on July 29. As to England, Profes\xad\nsor Fay shows that the English authorities \ndecided to take no chances on alienating \ntheir partners in the Triple Entente, and \nthat Grey had decided to enter the war on \nthe side of France and Russia before he had \nlearned of the German attitude toward Bel\xad\ngian neutrality.\nAustria’s Responsibility\nWhile it is impossible to escape the con\xad\nviction that Professor Fay places the re\xad\nsponsibility of the Entente ahead of that of \nGermany in regard to the precipitation of \nthe war, he regards Austria as having the \ngreatest immediate responsibility among all \nthe Powers. His stand in this regard is en\xad\ntirely inexplicable to the reviewer. One \ncould understand it in a Seton-Watson or \na Wickham Steed, but Professor Fay fully \naccepts the most thorough-going conception \nof Serbian complicity in the assassination \nand is scrupulously fair in his statement of \nthe facts regarding Austria. His exposition. \nof the Austro-Serbian impasse is the best in \nthe whole war guilt literature and funda\xad\nmentally far more damaging to Serbia than \nthe caustic strictures of Edith Durham. His \nsevere judgment of Austria is, in any event, \nnot purchased at the price of leniency in \nhis verdict relative to Serbia. In spite of \nthis comprehensive treatment of Serbian \nguilt, Professor Fay arrives at practically \nthe same judgment of Austria as that which \nhe set forth in 1920, when he constructed \nhis treatment under the aegis of Roderich \nGooss. Though Professor Fay now ridicules \nGoose’s view that “ the unsuspecting Em\xad\nperor William was the sacrificial lamb of\xad\nfered up on the altar of Berchtold’s reck\xad\nless perfidy and obstinacy,” the implica\xad\ntions of his own treatment are not far re\xad\nmoved from Gooss’s estimate. And though \nProfessor Fay criticizes certain writers for \nthe “ personal devil” interpretation of 1914, \nhis own interpretation of Berchtold certain\xad\nly falls within this category. In regard to \nBerchtold he is even willing to accept the \nestimate of Heinrich Kanner, whose reli\xad\nability he sagaciously disputes in other re\xad\nspects. While he excuses Poincare because \nthe latter regarded war as inevitable in \n1914, Professor Fay condemns Berchtold \nchiefly because he entertained the same con\xad\nviction. Yet Berchtold was only convinced\n', "448 CURRENT HISTORY, DECEMBER, 1928\nof the necessity of a local punitive war and \nabhorred the European war which Poincare \ncalmly envisaged. The moderate and mild- \nmannered Lowes Dickinson frankly concedes \nthe justice of the Austrian case: “ I do not \nbelieve there was a State in existence that \nwould not, under similar circumstances, \nhave determined, as Austria did, to finish \nthe menace, once for all, by war.”  Espe\xad\ncially cogent here also is Professor Langer’s \nsage observation: “Just because Berchtold \nand his associates hopelessly bungled their \ncase is no reason for blinking the fact that \ntheir case was good.”  We shall not hazard \nany explanation of Professor Fay’s harsh \njudgment of Austria, but it certainly does \nnot accord with the facts which he presents \nnor the tone of the remainder of the hook.\nFay’s Position Among the Revisionists\nMany will be inclined to hold that Profes\xad\nsor Fay’s concluding chapter is too brief \nand inadequate and that he has been over\xad\ncautious in his generalizations. Certainly \nhis estimate here of Germany’s relation to \nthe British diplomatic proposals does not \naccord with his detailed treatment of the \nsubject in the eighth chapter of the second \nvolume. Yet he does not fail to pass a de\xad\ncisive judgment on the' guilt clause of the \nTreaty of Versailles which is as effective as \nany blast delivered by the most buoyant \nand advanced revisionist who has ever as\xad\nsaulted that now venerable falsehood:\nOne must abandon the dictum of the Ver\xad\nsailles Treaty that Germany and her allies \nwere solely responsible. It was a dictum \nexacted by victors from vanquished, under \nthe influence of the blindness, ignorance, \nhatred and the propagandist misconceptions \nto which war had given rise. It was based \nupon evidence which was incomplete and \nnot always sound. It is generally recognized by the best historical scholars in all coun\xad\ntries to be no longer tenable or defensible.\nTherefore, as to whether Professor Fay \nbelongs among the bitter-enders, the sal\xad\nvagers or the revisionists, there can no long\xad\ner be the slightest particle of doubt. The \nonly question is as to just where he stands \namong the revisionists. In the fii-st place, \nit must be pointed out that he stands at \nthe head of all the revisionists, who have \nthus far put their material in print, from \nthe standpoint of scholarly competence as \na diplomatic historian and from the stand\xad\npoint of his mastery and marshalling of the\nevidence. While Professor Beazley or Pro\xad\nfessor Langer may possibly later displace \nhim, as yet Professor Fay is the supreme \nconventional scholar in the revisionist camp. \nMore difficult would it appear to some to \nplace him precisely among the revisionists \nas to the degree of revision of the Entente \nEpic which he would sanction. In tone and \nin his final conclusions he would have to \nbe classed as a moderate, whereas his facts \nwould place him as a thorough-going-, if not \nextreme, member of the revisionist group. \nAs compared with Victor Margueritte, for \nexample, while the essence of moderation in \nregard to the tone of his writings, Profes\xad\nsor Fay takes a much more advanced stand \nwith respect to the relative innocence of \nGermany and the Kaiser than does Mar\xad\ngueritte. It would seem that, all things con\xad\nsidered, Professor Fay would need to be \nplaced with the decisive but benign and \namiable revisionists, best exemplified by \nGooch, Dickinson, Barbagallo, Ewart, Lutz \nand Lingelbach, though his work is a more \nsmashing- blow for revisionism because of \nits greater recency and completeness. No \nimpartial reader can, however, doubt that \nFay stands much closer to the uncomp rising \nrevisionists like Beazley, Demartial, Mont- \ngelas, Langer, Schevill, Fabre-Luce, Ja- \npikse, Aall, Stieve and Lumbroso than he \ndoes to Schmitt, Renouvin, Slosson and \nothers of the salvaging camp. Indeed, he \nis closer to Bausman than to Renouvin. Of \nall other writers on the subject Fay most \nresembles in method, erudition, objectivity \nand interpretation the German scholar, Her\xad\nmann Lutz.\nWe may conclude with an expression \nof the hope that Professor Fay will \nsoon recover  fro m  any feeling- o f  timid\xad\nity which may depress him, and from \nany regret that he was unable to please \nthose of his profession who are more \ninterested in preserving their prejudices and \namour-propre than they are in arriving at \naccurate historical conceptions. He must \nrecognize that, in the long run, he will be \npermanently esteemed only by those who \nshare the conviction, which must cer-tainly \nhave guided him during his long and ar\xad\nduous labors on the book, namely, that noth\xad\ning should be as precious to the historian \nas truth, cleai-ly conceived and fearlessly \nexpressed.\n"]</pre>
