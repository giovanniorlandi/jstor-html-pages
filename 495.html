XI, UJWF Campaign, Maintains Heavy, Lead Over 1957, The United Jewish Welfare Fund drive has launched, its third phase, with four new divisions swinging into action, and returns from early efforts maintaining a pace 30 per, cent ahead of the record 1957 year., Going into action on Feb. 20 were the Special Gifts, Division, chairmanned by Sam Fineberg; the Farband-, Poale Zion Division under co-direction of Nathan Bordo, and Isaac Brooks; Advance Gifts, under Nat Silverman, and Harry Levine, and Metro Gifts, chairmanned by, Joseph Burdman., CONTRIBUTIONS have soared\', to near the SIOO,OOO mark despite, a division of effort necessitated bv, the opening of the new Kivel Nurs, ing Home., Donations totaled $94,194, com, pared with $72,951 from the same, givers a year ago. Phial results, are expected to surpass 1957’s total, by far because at least 1,000 more, pledges are expected this year in, addition to the improved level of, contributions by former givers., The present campaign is more, thoroughly organized than in the, past, with 15 divisions in operation., The campaign cabinet had only 11, operating divisions in 1957., A BREAKDOWN of contributions, as of Peb. 13, when only $80,244,, had been obtained for UJWP show- |, ed the greatest contributions from, the Benefactors, Patrons, and, Sponsors group—up from $42,752 to, $58,561.

Four years ago he, received an honorary doctorate of, literature from Arizona State Col, lege at Tempe., ISRAEL NEWSLETTER, Arab Union Poses Peril, By ELIAHU SALPETER, (Copyright. 1958, JTA. Inc.), JERUSALEM The union of, Egypt and Syria is of consider, able importance and concern not, only to Israel and the other Arab, States of the Middle East, but also, to all West European nations and, the Soviet Union. In a wider sense,, it is of concern to the United, States, too. The union, if only, officially declared and not actual, ly implemented in practice, is lia, ble to create further factors of, unrest and instability in the Mid, dle East., THE MILITARY dictatorships of, Egypt and Syria are very similar,, both in nature and purpose. Both, espouse “positive neutralism” of, the Moscow brand. Both received, considerable economic aid and, large quantities of arms from the, Soviet Union. Both are “have, nots” among the Arab states, as, opposed to pro-Western Iraq and, Saudi Arabia which are “haves.”, thanks to their rich oil resources., Egypt and Syria have to sur, mount considerable political and, economic problems before their, union can become a reality. But, the very efforts to overcome these, difficulties spell trouble for Israel,, the other Arab states and the West., IT IS VERY likely that the em, battled Arab rulers will again turn, to the usual weapon of inter-Arab, rivalry: they will again try to, prove that they are “more Arab”, than Egypt and Syria by being, even more violently anti-lbrael., This may well lead not only to, further virulent anti-Israel declar, ations but also to renewed incidents, along the Israel border., The union of Egypt and Syria, represents a considerable recovery, on the part of Nasser from his, inglorious defeat at the hands of, Party Is Scheduled, By Bikur Cholim, Ladies Bikur Cholim will hold, a supper and card and bingo par, ty from 5 to 8 p. m. March 9 at, Beth El Auditorium and has set its, annual election meeting for March, 18., The supper will be served by, Arizona State at Tempe sororitv, girls. Tickets, at $1.25 each, may, be obtained at the door. Friends, and members are invited., The organization’s board of di, rectors honored Mrs. A. Sechter,, nomination committee chairman,, with a surprise birthday visit at, he r home at 1514 E. 10th St. A, gift was donated to the Kivel Nurs.

(879., Israel in Sinai in November. 1956., It also marks his renewed effort, to create an “Arab Empire” from, the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian, Gulf., Dictators have an uncanny sin, cerity in declaring their aims in, their books. Democracies, as shown, in the case of Hitler’s “Mein, Kampf,” have an equally uncanny, blindness in refusing to read such, books. Again, it is clearly written, in Nasser’s slim, semi-literate book, outlining the aims of the Egyptian, revolution:, FIRST TO RULE the Arab coun, tries, then to dominate all Moslem, nations of the Middle East, and, ultimately to become the center, of the newly-liberated nations of, North and Central Africa and South, Asia., Naturally, the first step is to, get hold of the rich oil revenues of, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Therefore,, Nasser will do everything to under, mine the governments of these, countries., But simultaneously Nasser is, preparing the ground for the next, stage. His powerful radio trans, mitters spew out violent anti-Wes, tern propaganda in scores of na, tive languages among the colonial, peoples of Africa. Hundreds of his, agents are busy in newly-independ, ent or to-be-independent countries, sowing the seeds of subversion., The West is doing practically no, thing to counter these activities., READERS NOTICE, Everyone in the Phoenix Jewish Community will, receive this and the next issue of the Phoe, nix Jewish News.

Here, we are introduced to the Amster, dam family., Each member of that familv, fights an unheroic, almost fore, doomed battle against what one, calls the one constant of Western, Civilization: We could live, but, they simply won’t let us., The novel brings forth a very, Interesting array of characters, typical of those who live in Bos, ton suburban areas.

Therefore, this, super patriot, when it comes to, his own Jewishness, is lost be, cause he is hopelessly confused., HE IS NOSTALGICALLY Ortho, dox, but for family prestige he, feels he must be a member of a, Reform temple. Though he tries, very hard to make himself ac, cepted as a distinguished judge,, he nevertheless is a butcher in the, manner and form of his behavier, to his family and of his religius, convictions., All year round he does not ob, serve the Sabbath, he does not, fulfill any of the traditions, yet, he refuses to sit with his own, family.

Richard is left, like Marjorie Morningstar, alone, and bereft and no answer is given, as to their future., If these novels show to the Am, erican public how empty and hol, low is the life of a youne Jew, and Jewess today, then we must, say what a sad commentary it is, on the Jewry and Judaism we are, creating in America.

Feb. 4, The “United Arab Republic” proclaimed in Cairo, over the week-end must still prove its viability, but, there is one aspect of it which must be faced at once., The projected merger of Egypt and Syria marks one, more step in President Nasser's drive toward a pan-, Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic to the Per, sian Gulf and controlling Western Europe's lifeblood, and life lines—namely, oil and the arteries through, which it flows., The “grand design” of such an empire is laid down, in President Nasser's book, “Egypt's Liberation: The, Philosophy of the Revolution.” It is the Egyptian dicta, tor’s “Mein Kampf,” and there is more than coincid, ence in the parallelism between Hitler’s and Nasser’s, methods. Like Hitler, Nasser first carried out a more, or less legal “revolution” which ousted the existing, regime and created a totalitarian, one-party state., Then, in imitation of Hitler’s march into the Rhine, land, he seized the Suez Canal. Now, in imitation of, Hitler’s annexation of Austria, he is annexing and call, ing on all other Arab states to join the new union., Thus the construction of the first of three concent, ric circles of his influence—the Arab circle—is under, way. As Cairo emphasized, 90 per cent of all Middle, Eastern oil passes through the projected union by pipe, lines and the Suez Canal, which gives Nasser added, leverage to bring oil-producing states into line. He, follows Hitler even in making Israel the first target, of his drive, and this is true of his cooperation with, Soviet Russia to construct the wider second and Jhird, circles of his influence —Africa and Islam—on which, a start is being made by the “Little Cominform” in, Cairo., Hebrew Skit For Zionists, The Phoenix Brandeis Zionist Dis, trict wiU present a simulated com, mittee meeting in Hebrew at a, March 19 meeting at Beth EH Aud, itorium., The skit was written by Matthew, J.

The Phoenix, Jewish News correctly recognizes, the foolishness and impropemess of, the Federal approach to the pro, blems of education: and I ask un, animous consent that an editorial, entitled, “The Pot of Gold,” ap, pearing in the issue of Jan. 31. be, printed in the Appendix of the Rec, ord.”), Editor:, We were delighted to read in the, Phoenix Jewish News about the, general excellence award which, you have just won.

Unlike, Colonel Nasser’s United Arab Re, public, the Arab Federation plans, to give equal representation to, the two member countries even, though Iraq Is by far the stronger, and wealthier and has three times, the population of Jordan., THE FACT that the two coun, tries have a common frontier, seems to make their union a prac, tical and workable one. As the, New York Times’ Sam Pope Brew, er has pointed out, even their, flags are almost identical. The, new flag will simply have three, stars, instead of two in Iraq and, one in Jordan., The world is still wondering, what Saudi Arabia will do., At this writing, she retains com, plete independence.
