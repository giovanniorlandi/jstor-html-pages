The shaking, how\never was no less severe than in the one a\nyear ago by which the general public was\nso badly shaken.\nNothing serious has occurred in the war\nbetween Nicarauga and Honduras as yet,\nunless that mule has kicked the wind out\nof both armies and broken away and gone\nback to Mizouri where the braying ass is\nheard in the distant hills.\nThe spring poet has not yet put in his\nnor her appearance in this part of the mor\nal vinyard, the ice, probably, having not\nsufficiently thawed out to permit them to\nescape and that doubtless accounts for the\nscarcity of obituary notices.\nIf the senate investigation committee\nshould go south to hear the Brownsville\nfolks\' side of the raid story what more\ncould they learn even from them than\nSEATTLLE, WASHINGTON MARCH 29. 1907*\nwhat those selfsame citizens told President\nRoosevelt\'s emisaries about it?\nRyan\'s Legislative Manual is a thing of\nbeauty and Editor J. H. Ryan of the Taco\nma Forum is to be congratulated on the\ngeneral neatness of the publication. It is\nby far the most complete and valuable\nmanual ever turned out in the interest of a\nWashington state legislature.\nWe fear old age and actual death will\novertake some of those would be Seattle\nrealty investors, who are waiting for real\nestate in the city to go down from its\npresent prices in order to invest. For 15\nyears we have waited and watched for that\nday to come, but it has never come.\nSaloon keepers, who wilfully violate the\nSunday closing law, should be punished,\nbut the police should be careful not to\nwring in any spite work or any of their\npersonal feelings. The general public\nwants the law fully obeyed, but will stand\nfor no undue advantage being taken.\nState school funds were not dropped\ninto the Port Townsend water bond rat\nhole and thereby making it possible for\nsomeone to bag some $150,000 by the deal\nwhich they were not entitled to, and it is\nhinted that had much to do with the insur\nance publications going to the evening\nSwillbarrel.\nTwo retired office holders names were\nforged to a check, on which collection was\nasked by the forger, but the victim after\nlooking at the two signatures became leary\nof the genuineness of the check and had\nthe fellow arrested. Who ever heard of\nan ex-official either having any money in a\nbank or anywhere else.\nMullen and Gill may have had a \' \'fall\ning out," but unless we miss our guess\ntheir political and financial interests are\ntoo closely allied to not fall in on short no\ntice whenever it is necessary. Such fall\ning out is but another way of accomplish\ning certain ends that could not be unless a\npretense at falling out was made.\nGrafting- seems to be so common to the\nAmerican people just now that it may well\nbe pronounced a national epidemic. The\nman in authority who does not graft seems\nto be the exception and not the rule, and\nyet we are said to live in a Christian land,\nwhere the refining influences of civilization\ndoes its work so well that even lo the poor\nIndian is surrendering to it.\nAnd the secretary of state has taken\nthe insurance publications from the Post\nIntelligencerand gave them to the paper that\nmade him, Nichols, secretary of state. Sam\nwas rather slow in recognizing the good\nPRICE TEN CENTS.\nwork of the Times and likewise showing\nhis appreciation to the paper that stood by\nhim in the past two campaigns, but it is\nbetter late than never.\nRumor has it that A. L. Walters is\nabout to lose out and that John Hay will\nbe confirmed. We told you The Times was\ngoing to sink you, Mr. Walters. Now let\nothers take timely warning.\nIn showing up Harry Thaw\'s crazy\nfreaks the defendant\'s lawyers have built\nbetter than they expected, for Judge Fitz\ngerald has ordered a lunacy commission to\nexamine him, which is now trying to send\nHarry to the mad house instead of the\nelectric chair.\nA new epoch will dawn in the history\nof Seattle on April the 2d when The\nMorning Times hits the town. Twice be\nfore the editor in chief of The Times made\na similar newspaper sp c and each time\nignominiously failed, and his chances of\nsucceeding at this time seem no more\nbrilliant than on former occasions. A fool\nand his money soon part.\nA Key to Slang.\nPhilologists like to study slang. They\ncan account for many slang phrases that\nseem idiotic. Thus:\n"To give the cold shoulder."— It was\nthe custom in mediaeval France when a\nguest had outstayed his welcome, to serve\nhim a cold shoulder of mutton instead of\nthe usual hot meat. Flushing the man al\nways took this hint.\n"Deadheads."—ln Pompeii a compli\nmentary ticket to an entertainment took\nthe form of a small ivory skull.\n"He\'s a Brick."—A visitor to Sparta\nfound the capitol without walls, and asked\nthe king what he would do in case of in\nvasion in his wallless town. "Sparta has\n50,000 soldiers," the king answered, and\n\' \'each man is a brick.\'\'\n"Catching a Tartar."—During the war\nbetween Russia and Tartary a private sol\ndier shouted, "Captain, I have caught a\nTartar." "Well, bring him in," the cap\ntain rejoined. "He wont let me," the sol\ndier called despairingly, as his prisoner\ndragged him into the Tartar lines.\n"Skidoo 23."—The origin of this phrase\nis lost in the blackness of remotest antiq\nuity.\n"To eat humble pie."—ln the Middle\nAge, after a deer had been slaughtered,\nthe master of the house and his family ate\nthe choice cuts, while the feet, neck and\nhead were made into a pie. This humble\npie was served to the servants and retain\ners.—Ex.\nHigh grade commercial job printing at\nThe Republican on street.', 'it\n1\nP. J. SMITH,\nWho Does Things.\nDr. C. E. Hoye, who for two terms was\ncoroner of King county, but who for the\npast few years has been in charge of the\nhospital at the Ravensdale mines, was in\nthe city one day this week looking the pic\nture of health and incidentally sizing up\nthe political situation since the new direct\nprimary law has been passed. It is said\nthat Dr. Hoye has an eye single to the"\nnomination for sheriff of King county,\nwhich after casting over the field if possi\nble to learn the true situation he may au\nthoritatively announce. Hailing as he does\nfrom the famous south district of this\ncounty he will make a strong fight to di\nvide the votes with any one who may cross\nswords with him therein. \'\'I am not talk\ning politics just yet," said the doctor when\naccosted by the Pie-maker. "I do not\nknow whether or not I will be a candidate\nfor sheriff, but I think some other candi\ndate besides those who have been mention\ned in this connection will have to be trot\ntep! out before I would take a back seat. If\nI decide to go into the fight I propose to\nmake a scarp for it and lam not one of\nthose who makes a losing fight.\n# # *\nThe other candidates that the Pie-maker\nhas heard spoken of in connection with the\nshriveality contest are, P. J. Smith, of Is-H\naquah, who for many years was county:\ncommissioner and who dictated the nomi\nnation of his brother-in-law, A. L. Ruther\nford to succeed himself. There is hardly\nany doubt but that Mr. Smith has laid his\nplans well for the nomination and direct\nprimary or not he will be on hand when\nthe time comes round to land the job. He\nlike Dr. Hoye is strong in the south dis\ntrict and fairly strong in the north dis\ntrict. He has the county machinery be\nhind him and taking it all in all will prove\nto be rather a formidable candidate. Sher\niff Smith will help him all he can and the\ncounty commissioners will move heaven\nand earth to land him. He who thinks\nPete Smith is a \' \'dead one is so far off\nhis trolley that it will take him weeks to\nget on again.\n# # #\nFor the past two years or more A. L.\nWalters, who is now fighting Mayor Moore\nfor the street commissioner\'s job, has been\ncurrently reported as making an active\ncampaign for the nomination of sheriff,\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nDH. C. E. HOVE.\nSometimes Plays the Game of Polit^s\nwhen it is time to nominate a successor to\nSheriff Lou Smith whose successor will be\nelected next year. Had Mr. Walter been\nable to have served two years more as\nstreet commissioner he would have been a\nvery strong city candidate for he had the\nmachinery of the city behind him. As it\nis he is battling for a job with the odds for\nhis winning greatly against him. The\nDaily Times is backing him in the fight he is\nmaking against Mayor Moore, which im\npresses the average Republican that he if\na protege of The Times and that will as\ncompletely kill him as if his head was\nchopped off and thrown into the bay and\nthe body cremated. Anything The Times\nadvocates the better thinking- Republicans\noppose and fcr these reasons and these\nalone the Pic-maker is inclined to believe\nthat Walter\'s bcomlet will die a borning.\nJAMBS P. AGNEW,\nA King County Boss.\nI Ik. l jH\n*■\'•"■■■\nA. L. WALTERS,\nProtege of The Times.\nThe name of James P. Agnew, the pres\nent county auditor, has also been frequent\nly spoken of in connection with this nomi\nnation for sheriff, not only by Mr. Agnew\'s\nfriends, but by Mr. Agnew himself, if ru\nmor can be believed. In the late city\ncampaign Jim Agnew ran the convention\nnolens volens, and while he ran John Rip\nlinger out of the state, yet he ran the con\nvention just the same. In the fall cam\npaign his influence was also strongly felt.\n"He for some reason has a strong hold on\nthe party in the county and he is not slow\nin taking advantage of the grip he holds.\nThere is hardly any doubt but t..at he will\nbe a candidate for sheriff, and that he will\nalso attempt to name Dr. Breier as his suc\ncessor as county auditor. Agnew depends\nupon the influence brought to him by a\nleading railroad official and whatever prec\nedent he has attained while county auditor\nto give him the highest office in King\ncounty, and the Pie-maker is inclined to\nthink he has a very powerful leverage with\nwhich to lift the load.\n* # *\nThe nominations under the new direct\nprimary law will be made next June a year\nand of course the men who are seeking po\nlitical preferment have begun to plan for\nthe primary campaign.\n* # #\nLast week The Seattle Republican\npointed out to its readers that despite the\nfact the office of the prosecuting attorney\nwas doing* a great deal of boasting of the\nvigorous manner in which it was prosecut\ning the violators of the Sunday closing law\nin the city, yet in Georgetown, practically\na part of the city, though not in the corpo\nrate limits, the saloons are being run wide\nopen every Sunday, and the saloons being\nclosed in the city hundreds and thousands\nof drunken saloon bums flock to George\ntown where they spend a part of two nights\nand all day Sunday drinking and carousing\nand yet the prosecuting attorney\'s office is\njust as mute as a "mice" as to the wilful\nbreaking of the law out there. So bad has\nit become that Mayor Moore has held a\nconference with the officials of the Seattle\nElectric company with a view of putting\ntwo policemen on every car in order to keep\nthe drunken crowds quiet. Mr. Mackin\ntosh is serving his last term as prosecuting\nattorney and since he will hardly be able to\nland another political job, Senator Piles be\ning unable to deliver, it would seem that\nhe would do his duty and prosecute the vi-', 'olators of the law by filing an information\nagainst them. A hundred different men\nwould swear to the complaint and the pros\necutor need not stand back for someone to\ncomplain. It is his duty when he knows\nthe law is being flagrantly violated to have\nsomeone gather the evidence for him. If\nMr. Mackintosh is not going to do his duty\nhe ought to get out of office even before\nhis term expires.\n# * * .\nThere seems to be no donbt but that\nGeorgetown is nothing more nor less than\nsi beer garden for the brewery located\nthere and unless the prosecuting attorney\'s\noffice takes some steps to close the place\nup on Sundays by summer it will be such a\nhell hole that a decent man will not dare\ngo through the burg on Sunday, especially\nif he has his wife and children with him.\nThe brewery plant has been a strong polit\nical joker in the hands of Andrew Hemrich\nand he must be using it with telling effect\nin the little game with the prosecuting at\ntorney. Georgetown is rapidly becoming\nthe robbers\' roost of King county, and the\nprosecuting attorney and the sheriff are\nquite cognizant of the fact.\nAfro=Americanism.\nBooker T. Washington will speak to the\ncitizens of Indianapolis, Ind. at the Bethel\nA. M. E. church, under the auspices of the\nY. M. C. A. on April 2d-\nThe Kansas legislature has just made\nan appropriation of $55,880 to Western\nUniversity at Quindaro, Kansas, and $27,\n--000 to the Topeka Industrial Schooll.\nThe two branches of the K. P. amonr\nNegroes have decided to unite. Commit\ntees have met and agreed on a basis of\nunion, and August is the date set for the\nunion.\nDr. D. J. Saunders, president cf Biddle\nUniversity, Charlotte, N. C, died March\n14, after a brief illness. Dr. Saunders was\n60 years old; has been president of Biddle\nfor 19 years. He was a native of Chester,\nSouth Carolina.\nHon. Chas. W. Anderson, collector of\ninternal revenues for the Second district of\nNew York, has appointed Robert I. Plum\nmer as a deputy in the Tobacco division of\nhis office at a salary of $1,200 a year. Mr.\nPlummer is a member of the Republican\ncounty committee and also of the executive\ncommittee of the Colored Republican club\nof the city of New York.\nThe report of Hon. Morton Marye, au\nditor of public accounts in Virginia, for\n1906, just published, makes the following\nreport relative to the Negroes of that state.\n"The Negroes own in the state, 1,365,426\nacres of farm land valued at $5,844,953.\nThey own houses on them valued at $2,091,\n--129. They own personal property valued\nat $5,989,048. This is by no means a bad\nshowing in 40 years. ,\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nFlora Wolfe, the Afro-American who\nlived with the late Lord Delavel Beresford,\nof England, in Mexico, as his common law\nwife for 20 years, has been offered $500,\n--000, and all cattle on the ranch, valued at\n$250,000, li she withdraws her claim as\nthe dead lord\'s wife. She will not accept\nthe offer. The estate is valued at $6,000,\n--000 and she has proved her right as com\nmon law wife, under the Mexican law\nwhich the English courts will uphold.\nIn 1776, when the Colonial army under\nGeneral George Washington moved for\nward to overtake the British under General\nGates, a gun of curious make was left at\nthe camp, which happened to be on the\noutskirts of a farm owned by a colored\nman, John Lewis by name. This gun,\nwhich has been preserverved in the family\nof John Lewis as a sacred heirloom, has\nbeen kindly loaned to the Negro exhibit,\nand will be found in the Negro building at\nJamestown.\nThe Rhodes scholarship for the state of\nPennsylvania has this year been awarded\nto a colored man.

In\nthe will of the late Cecil Rhodes it is pro\nvided that eoler or religion shall make no\ndifference in the selection of the candidate,\nand Lccke wes chosen on his merits.\nThere weie five who passed the examina\ntions, which were held at Lafayette college\non January 17 and I s, and of these Locke\nwas deemed the best fitted to receive the\nini—nmiiiiiiiiiiiiiM»\'iiiiiiwi IT* I MinWiivi\'ftaimrwMCTWi\n50 Cents per Month.\nDaily and Sunday\nPost-Intelligencer\n(MORNING EDITION)\nThe Great Newspaper of th •\nPacific Northwest delivered by\ncarrier at your home in Greater\nSeattle or Important outside\ntowns for 50 cents per month....\nOnly Seven-Day As\nsocated Press News\npaper in Seattle.\nMost complete telegraph and\ncable service from all over the\nworld.

Locke will be the first Negro to\nget one of the American Rhodes scholar\nships.\nThe individual, race or nationality that\nwill Jim Crow or discriminate against their\nown race in business for the sake of curry\ning favor with some other race, and for a\nfew paltry dollars, is a moral, cringing,\nperveted coward, and is wholly devoid of\ncommon sense, self-respect and manhood,\nand as the Negro is the only race that com\nmits this contemptible, unprincipled, nefa\nrious act, it appeals to him with all the\nforce at our command, and when the other\nraces in business draw the line on the col\nored man a howl goes up, but they have an\niron-clad argument to sustain their posi\ntion, made so by the Negro business men.\nHow long will this continue?— Denver\nStatesman.\nIn mobile, according to reliable infor\ntion, out of nineteen letter carriers, eigh\nteen are colored. In Montgomery, out of\ntwenty-four, twenty-two are colored. Mr.\nC. 0. Harris has been chief mailing clerk\nin the Montgomery postoffice quite a quar\nter of a century, and no man in the build\ning is more highly respected than he. In\nMobile four-fifths of the employees in the\npostoffice are colored, and the same pro\nportion is true in the Montgomery post\noffice. Whenever and wherever there is a\ncivil service examination, the Negro is to\nbe found in large numbers, and he permits\nnothing to stand in the way of his showing\nwhat he can do in the direction of prepar\ning himself to serve the government.\nScores of examples can be produced where\nthe Negro distances all competitors and\nstands at the head of the eligible list.\nPress, People and Primary Law.\nAccording to the provisions of the new\nprimary election law, candidates for office\nat the primary election are prohibited from\npaying money or any other valuable thing\nto a newspaper for advocating their candi\ndacy. Candidates, therefore, who desire\nto use the press as an aid in bringing about\ntheir nomination must own a newspaper or\ntake a subscription from fifty to five-hun\ndred years according to subscription price,\nsize of candidate\'s purse, and salary and\nimportance of office sought. How the edi\ntors will smile as during the campaign pre\nceding the primary election they read in\ntheir subscription lists: John Smith, paid\nto Jan. 1, 2407; Peter Jones, paid to Sept.\n1, 2200, etc. —Vancouver Columbian.\nOf course if the Vancouver Columbian\nassumes that all the newspapers in the\nstate of Washington are corrupt, and that\nall candidates for office hereafter are to be\ncorrupt also, the primary election law will\nnot count for a great deal, so far as certain\nvicious practices are concerned; but doesn\'t\nthis assumption slander the press and peo\nple of this state? Any law not backed by\nhealthy moral sentiment must become a\ndead letter, and the primary election law,\nif the public, newspapers and politicians\nconspire to defeat its purposes, will prove\nno exception to the rule.\nThe case assumed by the Columbian is,', "of course, possible; but wouldn't it be sim\npler and easier, and quite as safe, just to\ngive the editor the cold cash? There is a\nlaw against murder; but men still men kill\neach other. There is a law against lar\nceny; but the thief still thrives. It is man\nifestly impossible for any body of law\nmakers, however wise and patriotic they\nmay be, to legislate goodnecs into the souls\nof men; at the same time lawmakers may\nput certain reasonable restraints upon the\nvicious impulses of human nature, and this\nis precisely what the legislature undertook\nto do when it wrote the newspaper provis\nions into the primary election law.\nDespite unfavorable criticisms these sec\ntions will go far toward eliminating the\ncorrupt newspaper as a factor in state pol\nitics. Candidates who have fat purses and\nlean morals may pad a few subscription\nlists, and otherwise consort with newspa\npers that think more of the pabulum that\njingles than they do of the public weal, but\nin the final struggle they will have the\npeople and the decent press to contend\nwith.\nNewspapers that are corrupt enough to\nsell their opinions will not be strong enough\nto boost men into the important offices of\nthis state hereafter. The people will de\ncide political contests in Washington hence\nforth.—Post Intelligencer.\nNews of the Week.\nFRIDAY.\nWm. J. Bryan denies that Mayor Tom\nL.

People remember the rise\nand fall of the bicycle craze. In\'^the\'closing\nyears of the last century people went cycle\nmad; the industry seemed to be a veritable\neldorado and there was a rush to engage in\nit. Then the craze declined and today\nthere are not one-fourth as many bicycle\nfactories as then.\nIs the automobile industry destined to.\nshare a similar fate? Generally it may be\nsaid that this is not probable, yet not im\npossible. The auto business has not yet\npassed its fad stage. No one can tell how\nsoon a change in fashion may abandon the\nauto for some other object of interest,\nmuch as it did the bicycle. Yet the chances\nare that such will not be the case. That\nthe investing world has no such collapse in\nmind as yet is evident from the census fig\nures of increase during the latter five years\nof production as shown below:\nFive Year Growth of the Automobile Industry.\nItems— 1905 1900 Inc. Pet.\nCapital $20,555,247 $5,768,857 256.3\nWages 6,178,950 1,320,658 367.9\nCost of Material ... 11,658,138 1,804,287 546.1\nValue of Product... 26,645,064 4,748,011 461.1\nThese figures on the automobile indus\ntry illustrate the extreme rapidity with\nwhich the demand for new products ex\npanded. In 1900 there were 57 establish\nments engaged in manufacturing automo\nbiles in this country, and in 1905 the num\nber had ris to 121. Investments at the\nearlier date ere $5,768,857, and at the\nlatter $20,555,247.\nThe enormous rates of increase contrast\nsharply with the rapid decrease in the once\nTHE SEATTLE REPUBLICAN\nprosperous bicycle industry, as exhibited\nin the comparison for the same years:\nFive-Year Decrease in Bicycle and Tricycle In\ndustry.\nItems— 1905 1900 Dec.

The bicyle industry\nhad to look for its demand to personal use,\nlargely for pleasure. With the disappear\nance of the machine for pleasurable purpo\nses, the industry shrank to an insignificant\npart of its earlier proportions.\nA much wider field of service apparently\nawaits the automobile for the very reason\nthat its uses are applicable to performing\nmany of the commercial operations which\nare among the most expensive features of\ndistribution. Furthermore it is based upon\nthe application of mechanical power to ve\nhicular propulsion. This fact completely\ndifferentiates it from the status of the bi\ncycle as a means of carriage. On account\nof this the future oi the automobile is not\nby any means liable to the danger of col\nlapse which befell the bicycle trade. The\nreal danger lies rather in the effort to keep\nup prices to a point which forbids the more\ngeneral use of the automobile in various\nforms of travel and traffic.\nThere is hardly a man of the middle\nclasses who does not cherish the hope of\nsomeday owning a "bubble." At the\npresent rate it will not be long until all the\nrich people are supplied with autos and the\nmanufacturers will then be obiiged to look\nelsewhere for a market. This can only be\nfound among the middle classes, and to\ncreate a demand in that direction prices\nwill have to come down. We confidently\nlook forward to the time when every far\nmer and every skilled laborer will be the\nproud owner of a serviceable auto, and\nprices will decline so as to be within the\nreach of all.\nTHE HOUSE OF\nQUALITY\nWe carry thp greatest line of Pianos\nin the world.\nVictor Talking Machine\nSHERMAN, CLAY & CO.\n1406 2nd Aye.\nThe ank for Savings.\no\nSavings Accounts Only Received.\nTRUSTEES\nR.
