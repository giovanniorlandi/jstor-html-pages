VOL 46 No. 17\nTHE CHIEF CALLS\nATTENTION TO\nPOINTS WHEN\nPHONING\nExplains Some of the Rea\nsons Fire Information.\nShoulc3e Exact.\nNECESSARY TO\nGOOD WORK\nIt Is Needed to Know Just\nWhat Equipment to\nTake Out First.\n.~otice, Residents of Covington! An\nAppeal from the Chief of the File\nDepartment:\nFor the information of those res\nidents of Covington who may not be\nfamiliar with the fact, I will begin\nby saying that when a fire report is\ntelephones are set in motion at the\nelephones are set in motion at the\nsame time, namely, the one at the\nIce House, one at the residence of\nthe Chief, and one at the engine\nhouse.\nIt is therefore imperative in order\nto facilitate matters and insure quicik\naction that two facts be reported:\n(1), the EXACT location of the fire,\nand (2) what the nature of the fire\nis, whether it is a chimney, a roof,\nor an entire house. This latter in\nformation will brng the most neces\nsary apparatus to the fire first.\nRecently a fire was reported on\n"26th Ave.", with no further diree\ntion or explanation. The entire fire\ndepartment answered the call, but\nwhen 26th Ave. was reached there\nwas neither sign of fire nor of any\none who had reported or knew of it.\ntBplng a volunteer organization\nmade up of men who have personal\nbusiness interests, the members of\nthe tire department feel that it is\nsimply fair that they be definitely\ndirected when called out gives be.it\n.results.\nI therefore ask every esident of\nCo.ington to school himself to two\n+aeits when reporting a fire: (1) Give\nthe names of at least two streets.\nFor instance, if the fire is on Jeffer\nson Avenue report that fact, ani\nin addition tell at or near what other\nSstreet it is. The fact that it is Bi:l\'.\nor Tom\'s house makes no material\ndifference, as we cannot keep track\nof where everyone lives. And (2)\nreport as accurately as \'possible the\n.gsture of the fire, whether it is the\nl.0of, the chimney or the whole\n`ease.\nAll the Fire Department wants to\nhaow is where, and exactly where\nthe fire can be located within .he\nshortest space of time, and also whit\nequipment to have on hand first. If\nyen say the fire has just started\nWe take the chemical first, but if\n`you say it has gained great hea~t\nwsa, we take both chemical al i\nlarge pump.\nJ.

Dulion was the victim of\na most brutal and cowardly assault,\nThursday. In the performance of\nhis usual \'duties as collector for the\nSt. Tammany Ice & Mfg. Co., he call\ned upon Julius Rushing to collect\nthe monthly account for service.\nBad feeling was engendered during\na discussion of the account, it is said,\nwhen rushing made some remark as\nto Mr. Dulion\'s age being his protec\ntion. Mr. Dulion told him not to\nlet that stand in the way of any In\ntentions he might have in that direc\n,tion. Finally, after further talk, Mr.\nDulion left the store. He was fol\nlowed by Rushing, who assaulted\nhim-some twenty feet from the door.\nMr. DullOn is.very deaf and prob\nably did not hear Rushing walking\nbehind him. He was struck with an\naxe handle, the blow being so violent\nMr. Dulion reached another house\nwithout assistance and a phyilcian\nwas summoned. Mhile Mr. Dulion\nwill probably recover, he was severe\nly hurt and indignation is expressed\nat the cowardly assault.\nRushing was arrested and placed\nin jail without the privilege of bond.\nMr. Dulion was formerly marshal\nof Covington. He has always been\nknown as a man of great courage\nand is esteemed as a good and peace\nable citizen.\n-0-----\nAT THE BAPTIST CHURCH.\nAt the Baptist Church, on Sunday,\nMarch 14, Sunday School at 10 a. m.\nSermon at 11 a. m., subject, "The\nPresence of God With Us."

C. Wilhite, the national sec\nretary of the Mississippi Valley High\nway Association, of Greenfield, Ill.,\nand Mr. J. Kelly Smith, an attorney\nand real estate man of Kentucky, ac.\ndressed a number of citizens of St.\nTammany and Tangipahoa parishes\non the values and benefits derived\nfrom the "Missiesippi Valley Highwav\npassing through the communities\nand towns on and along this high\nway. They visualized the endless\nand unceasing travel of cars bearing\ntourists passing back and forth the\nyear round from Ely, Minnesota, to\nNew Orleans, over what is already\nthe beat marked highway in the\nUnited States.\nThis highway is not marked, how\never, from Hattiesburg to New Or\nleans, and these gentlemen were\nprincipally interested in getting this\ndivision of the highway marked tc\nmeet the approval of the Association,\nthis marking to be done by local\nclubs, and an appeal was made to\nthe Association of Commerce of Cov\nington to take care of the marking\nthrough St. Tammany parish. Pres\nident J. H. Warner pledged the as\nsistance of the Association of Com\nmerce and promised to take care of\nthe marking through St. Tammany.\nCovington is also required to retain\na minimum membership of twenty\nmembers for five years who will con\ntribute $5.00 a year each. This\npledge was also made good by Presi\ndent Warner, and the chairman of\nthe Traffic Bureun was immediately\ninstructed to take the necessary\nsteps towards -getting prices on thl\nnecessary posts with which to mark\nthe highway through St. Tamjnany.\nAmong the visitors from Ham\nmond were Messrs. W. H. Nalty of\nthe Hammond Lumber Co.; J. M.\nFourmy, highway engineer; J. A.\nJumonville, member police jury, and\nMr. Wilson, postmaster; E. A. Hear\nring, secretary of Hammond Cham\nber of Commerce, and Mr. Waldrup,\npresident.\nThe point was brought out at th~a\nmeeting that the Mississippi Valley\nHighway stands a good chance to be\nselected and taken over by the gov\nernment for a military highway by\nthe provisions of the bill now ,peund\ning in Congress. The highway is 300\nmiles shorter than any other north\nand south national highway. This\nis a good point in our favor.

This is the slogan of\nthe Mississippi Valley Highway As\nsciat\'on, which is routed through\nCovington.\nThe service sign will be placed at\nentrances to towns, naming the\ntown and the next three towns,\nstating the distances to them. These\nwill carry also an advertisement and\nthe advertisers pay for the sign and\nthe poet that it is on. Guide signs\nwill be placed along this highway at\nevery intersection of another road\nor cross-road, sharp curves and rail\nroad crossings to guide the traveling\npublic on the "Big Highway." These\nsigns will be conspicuous, arranged\nso the automobile headlight will il\nluminate them at night. Through\nthe towns there will be a "white\nway." Electrically equipped and\nlighted sign posts bearing the high\nway emblem will .be placed at street\ncrossings. All of the above and the\ncurrent for the lighting will be paid\nfor by the National Highway Mark\ners Association. It will be neces\nsary for our town council to grant\npermit before these signs can be\nerected.\nIn addition to the above, the Higl\nway Association furnishes a metal\nplate to go on all the above sign\nposts. This plate bears the high\nway emblem "M" on white back\nground, "V" on gold background\njust below, and under this an "H"\non white ;background. The mono\ngram stands for the Mississippi Val\nley Highway, and the top white baud\nrepresents the snow-capped moun\ntains of the north, where this high\nway starts. The orange band rep\nresents the fields of golden gramn m\nIowa, Illinois and Missouri, and the\nbottom white band symbolizes the\ncotton fields of Dixie and the white\nsands of our gulf coast.\nEven in addition to this there will\nfe concrete sign posts every quar\nter mile through the 26 miles of our\n,Parish.\nThe posts will bear the emblem\non colors in point. The Association\nof Commerce chose the concrete post\nbecause they are indestructible by\nwoods fires. The local road club\nhaving not been organized at the\nmeeting here Saturday the Assoola\ntion of Commerce was called upon\nby the National Highway Associa\ntion officials to guarantee the quota\nof at least 20 in the club, and the\nerection of these 104 posts through\nour Parish. As this Is a Parish-wide\naffair, and as the Asseociation of\nCommerce has already been to some\nheavy expense in getting this road\nrouted through our Parish, the Po\nlice Jury consented, Tuesday, to ap\npropriate enough money to erect the\nposts.\nUntil the Covington-Hfammond\nconnection is opened up to travel, the\nM. V. Highway will be temporari\nly routed via Madisonvll4 and Pon\nchatoula by signs erected along the\nroute.\n---0---\nTHE DISTRICT COUURT\nJudge Carter presided and Dis\ntrict Attorney Brock prosecuted at\nthe session of the District Court this\nweek, which adjourned Thursday.\nThere was little business before the\nCourt, but the one criminal case that\nattracted some attention by reason\nof its notoriety in chicken thievery.\nFronie Williams was sentenced to 18\nmonths in the pen.

MASON .- - - - - ditor and Proprietor\nEntered at the Covington postoffice as Second-Class Matter.\nTHE COVINGTOSW FIRE DEPARTMENT.\nEvery town Should take pride n its public utilities-its water woras,\nsever system, and fire department. Until a town has instituted these\nthings and perfected them to pra:tical and efficient service, it is not\na town. It is in the village class. i f a town is too poor to have these\nthings it must bow to the inevitable and be satisfied with its humble po\nsition. But if a town is able to ha ec them; if the assessed value of .,\nproeprty, its population and other conditions show that It is as well off\nas other towns that do have them, then the community is either indif\nferent or lacking in the business capacity that makes things hum else\nwhere.\nThe recent fire, in which fo ir buildings were destroyed before the\nfire equipment could be got to wor:c has caused some criticism of the\ndepartment. Some of it is justified and some is not. For years Covina\nton was served by a volunteer fire department. The boys turned out and\nfought like tigers at every fire. They risked life and limb, crawled out\nof their beds on cold winter nights and ruined their clothing--all for\nglory and loyalty to the town. Bit as the town grew, better equipmelt\nwas needed. This called for somre way of raising money and a benev\nolent association was organized Loyalty was then considerably knoc\':el\nin the head,.for when a man begins to receive benefits or remuneration\nfor services the props drop from under the sentiment that urges volun\ntary sacrifices. It is like helping the blind for a percentage of what you\ngive. Then we drifted into a partly paid service-a nman was em\nployed to take charge of the engine and have it ready for fires and the\ntown helped out with small appropriations. There is not enough money\navailable to the department to keep up the equipment and get ,to fires\npromptly. There is but one way to have a fire department, and that is\nto pay for it. And a fire department without water works is not worth\nmuch, either. So it is up to the community to put in water works and\naq lre department--or else be satisfied to let the houses burn without\ncriticism of those who try to put out the fire with an equipment that is\neither defective or not properly handled, free of charge, and who goes\nhome like a rabbit smoked out of a hollow log, not knowing what re\nception he is going to get at the o\'ner end of it. The loudest criticism\nfrequently comes from those who stand by and see the buildings burl\nbut do no fire fighting .\nIt is undoubtedly true that as It is run or as it is possible to be run\nwithout money, the department Is but a makeshift. Results speak.\nWhile the town has frequently been saved from opread of fire, it is gen\nerally admitted that if a fire ever gets a good start in the business por\ntion of the town there will be little chance to stop it. It is up to the\npeople to decide whether such an outlook in desirable or if it would pay\nto vote a bond issue for water -works and to put something into a fire\ndepartment-not even as much as the loss from such a fire would be.\nIt\'in really worth thinking about. ~ -AL.. ;.\nNOTICE.\nNo trapping or hunting allowed on\nmy land.

Clerk of Court.\nSAVINGS\nSERMONETTE\nTHE SOURCE OF FORTUNES.\nIf most people stopped to realize\nhow money grows there would be\nmuch more saving and consequently\nmuch more prosperity in the wor;d.\nRegardless of the fact that the\nmost universal of all desires is ,per\nhaps the accumulation of money,\nthere is less system employed in con\nserving it than almost anything else.\nA very common fallacy among peo\nple who do not save is the belief\nthat to make money it is necessary\nto have a considerable sum with\nwhich to start. This is a costly\nmistake. The keynote of all sav\nings, and, incidentally, of all invest\nment was sounded by Benjamin\nFranklin when he said: "M.n.y\nmakes money and the money hat\nmoney makes, makes more money.\'\nThis maxim applies to all sums of\nmoney. When you come to trace\nsome of the great self-made fol\ntunes to their sources you will find\nthem realized at a very early age\nthat small sums were worth sav\ning.
