Vardaman:\n♦\n♦\n♦\n"Good God," said the woodcock, when the owl hit him. You seem <•\n♦ to have shown them where Johnny hid the wedge. Congratulations." ❖\n*>\n♦\n,\n<*❖❖❖•>❖•>❖❖❖❖❖❖•>❖•> ❖•> ❖ •> ❖ •> ❖ <• •> ♦> <* •> 4 •> ❖ ♦> ❖ •>\nAll true Mississippians must have swelled with pride when they read\nthat masterpiece of classical felicitation. How genuinely it comports with\nthe dignity of the offices of Governor and Senator. What a brainstorm of\neclat it will excite among nations as it goes thundering down the ages.\nWhat a charming flow of street slang it contains. What a paucity of clean\nEnglish expression it suggests. And if it be an earnest of state papers that\nare to follow, or any fair measurement of the acumen of he who for the\ncoming four years shall sit in the gubernatorial chair, then indeed may all\nMississippi exclaim with surprise and consternation, "Our God, upon what\nevil lines have we fallen!\'\'\nI\nMISSISSIPPI TOBACCO\nGarrard Harris, who edits a column on Mississippi News and Comment in\nthe Mobile Register, saya:\n"The tobacco crop of the Mississippi state penitentiary is attracting at\ntention all over the country, and representatives of the French and Italian\ngovernments have made overtures for the purchase of the entire crop. Mr.\nBrewer of Clarksdale. head of the American Tobacco Company (Mississippi)\n■aye in all his expeirence as a tobacco raiser and handler he has never seen\na crop so promising or of as fine a quai Ity. Some of the tobacco, especially\nthe dark leaf, he says will sell all the way from 12 l-2c to 15c per pound,\nand the indications are it will run 1,600 pounds per acre. It was planted\nthis year merely as an experiment; next year the culture will be undertak\nen on a larger scale. There are only about 25 acres on the Parchnian\nOakley and Rankin farms this year."\nin\n*\nThe Vardaman people are in the saddle and have a right to ride; if they\nride too recklessly, however, they will ditch themselves. If they undertake to\n"Impeach Noel," as they threaten to do, and refuse to confirm his appoint\nments for various and sundry offices, t hey will but justify and confirm the\ncharges made by their enemies that because of their extreme radicalism\nand wild intolerance they are a political danger and menace to peace and\nquiet and good government in this state. The News, which no man can\naccuse of being in the least partisan or prejudiced in the recent contest,\nhopes that much of the talk now afloat is but the wild vaporlngs of the\nradical element in the Vardaman rank, and that it does not reflect the senti\nment of the more.thoughtful and judicious ones who will control the policy of\nthe incoming administration. Political enemies of Mr. Vardaman could\nIrish him no worse luck than for his friends in the incoming legislature to\npursue the radical policy some of them are advocating. In his next race,\nwhich of course the senator-elect already has in contemplation, he will\nhave to answer for all the sins committed these next four years in Missis\nsippi, in the name of "Vardamanism." Neither as champion or foe, but as\na candid and would-be friendly critic, The News admonishes the victorious\nVardaman hosts that they ride not ruthlessly over the rights of others, but\ndeal fairly and justly and wisely with the interest of the state, lest the\nmisuse of the power which the people have given them, be the cause of\ntheir own undoing and the unhorsing of their great "White Chief."\nt\n"If Mississippi is sorry," says the Memphis Commercial Appeal, "she\nhasn\'t got any of the earmarks." Mississippi is not sorry. There is but\npolitical party in Mississippi; and that is the White Mans Party; and\nwhatever a majority of that party says. goes. Of course it is different la\nTennessee, where hoodlum whites and negroes combine against the better\nelement of society.

Rather let it bemoan the fate of poor old Tennes\nsee; debauched, polluted and disgraced by Pattersonism, for which the Com\nmercial Appeal has consistently fought with zeal and ability worthy a bet\nter cause.\n*\nBEING MASTER OF SELF\nThe following, written by Dr. C. H. Parkhurst. Is furnished by the Na\ntional News Service:\n"The most difficult kind of mastery is self-mastery.\nWe have good au\nthority for it that \'he that ruleth his own spirit is greater than he that\ntaketh a city.\'\n"A man can reduce a walled town and still be taken captive by his own\ndespotic impulses or irritable disposition. To be touchy is a sign of de\nfeat. The boy who can be rolled by his chum without getting mad about It\nand striking back is a more masterful fellow than the one who squares\naccounts by administering a thrashing.\n"Even a dog shows himself to be a mastiff by ignoring the harrying giv\nhlm by the Ignominious cur that barks at his heels,\nto be worried by the affronts pot upon one\'s dignity.\n"The best proof of dignity Is to be willing to let it take care of Itself.\nTo protect it is to confess our distrust of it.\n"To draw the sword in its defense Is to acknowledge that it is vulner\nable. People do not sit up nights watching for burglars if they are quite\nsure that there are no weak spots in their domicile through which inter\nIt is a bad give\n\\\naway\nf\nlopers can intrude.\n"It should be reckoned one of the prime qualifications for public office\nthat the candidate should be bo self-centered and so sovereign over his won\nImpulses as to secure him against ebullitions of temper and outputs of a\nrancid disposition.\n"Touchiness in a public official, especially if he have large interests\ncommitted to his care, works perversity of judgment, narrowness of policy\nAnd the more dignified the position\nand unsteadiness of administration,\nofficially occupied, the more painful and pitiful become the childish, querul\nand acrimonious acts of Its incumbent.\nto strike back and to seek inward relief by the dls\nous\n"For H\ncharge of accumulated venom Into the person of an offending party is al\ncase of a child, but in the case of a grown-up and\niary H Is as silly as It Is deplorable."\nmost excusable In tt>\nexalted public functlt\nhope that LeRoy Percy will not do the Bailey act, resign, or say\nLet us\nA« will resign,\n\\\nr\nv*\nI\nI\nj\ni\nI\nI\nj\n;\nThat those who say they cannot save\nusually draw larger incomes than\nthose who actually do save.\nIt\nIs\nA\nMisfortune nits hardest those who\nearn most and spend most but save\nnothing.\nF act\nRemember: It is the dollar you do\nNOT spend that puts you ahead.\n$\nSave something,\nto spend all of his or her income.\nNo one can afford\nAn account at our bank will h©lp you.\nWe allow 4 per cent, and your money\nis always available at the expiration\nof interest periods.\nCitizens Bank\nHattiesburg\nj\nForum of the People %\nIt is well nigh impossible for me\nsee all of you, the voters of Beat One,\nbefore the second Primary; therefore j\nI take this method of thanking you for\nAN EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE\nFROM MR.
