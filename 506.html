It is but a few\nyears since the discovery was made of\na method of imparting this delicious\nflavor to dishes without the use of\nmaple syrup. The new flavoring ex\ntract was appropriately named Ma\nple ine.\nStrange as it may seem, Vermonters\nthemselves cannot tell the difference\nbetween syrup made with Mapleine\nand that which comes from their own\nGreen Mountain state. This is due to\nthe purity of the ingredients and the\ncare used in the manufacture.\nMapleine is perfectly healthful, is\npurely vegetable and makes a syrup\nthat is equal to any and superior to\nmany brands of maple syrup that are\nplaced on the market\nFlavoring for cakes, icings, blanc\nmange, sauce, etc., that is delicious\nand has all the piquancy and delicacy\nof maple syrup can be readily made\nby the addition of a few drops of\nMapleine to a little water in which\ngranulated sugar has been dissolved.\nMapleine syrup makes such dishes as\nrice, tapioca, stale bread, etc., simply\nirresistible to children.\nMapleine Dainties is the title of\nbooklet full of wholesome receipts pub\nlished by the Crescent Manufacturing\ncompany, who make Mapleine.

It haa been\nmanv a day since a decision of the\nUnited States Supreme court haa been\nreceived with aa much interest aa was\nmanifested yesterday In\'the reversal of\nthe Circuit court\'s "commodities\nclause" decision, affecting the anthra\ncite coal carrying railroads. These\ncases had been decided by the Circuit\ncourt favorably to the railroads, in\nthat the clause of the Hepburn rate\nlaw which prohibits interstate rail\nroads from carrying commodities man\nufactured, mined or produced directly\nor indirectly by the road waa declared\nunconstitutional. The general impres\nsion had been that the decision would\nbe affirmed by the Supreme court\nWhen, therefore, there waa a reversal\ninstead of an affirmation the interest\nwas much magnified. When again it\nwas found that the reversal was based\non technical grounds, and that the\neffect was really favorable to the rail\nroad companies, sentiment took another\nturn.\nThe decision was announced by Jus\ntice White, who declined to give out\nmore than a summary, showing the net\nresult of the court a finding. Because\nof the court\'s delay in announcing its\nconclusion it was generally supposed\nthat the court would be found to be\nmuch divided. Only one dissenting\nopinion was announced Justice Har\nlan\'s statement that he did not follow\nthe conclusion on the point that the\nlaw did not prohibit the railroad own\nership of stock in commodities-produc\ning companies.\nAnalyzed, Justice White\'s decision\nis that congress did not transcend its\nconstitutional authority in enacting the\ncommodities provision, but it was held\nthat the government a construction of\nthe provision had been entirely too\ncomprehensive. As construed by the\ncourt the sole object of the clause is\nto prevent carriers being associated in\ninterest with the commodities trans\nported at the time of transportation\nSummed up, the act only compels com\npanies to disassociate themselves from\nthe products they carry and the gov\nernment contention that the law applies\nto the ownership of stock and prohibits\nthe transportation of commodities sim\nply because they have been produced\nby a railroad company is untenable.\nThe effect of the decision is favor\nable to the railroads and the govern\nment lost on practically all points ex\ncept in the sustaining of the principle\ninvolved.\nThe decision sustained the provision\nof the law exempting timber from the\noperations of the commodities clause.\nThis exemption was used as a basis of\nattack by the railroads.\nWELCHERS CANNOT DODGE.\nInsurance Companies Liable for Loss\nin San Francisco Fire.\nSan Francisco, May 4. In an opin\nion handed down by the United States\nCircuit Court of Appeals today, the\neffort of certain insurance companies\nto bring losses sustained by fires dur\ning the conflagration of 1906 under the\nearthquake clauses of the policies, be\ncause the shock broke water mains\nand thus prevented the extinguishing\nof the fires, was rejected and charac\nterized as being as trivial as it would\nhave been to seek the same action on\nappeal because the men and horses of\nthe fire department bad been injured\nby the earthquake. The companies in\nvolved were the Commercial Union\nAssurance company, the Alliance In\nsurance company and the Norwich\nUnion Fire Insurance company and\nthe Pacific Union club was the policy\nholder in each case.\nAbdul\'s Sanguinary Plot,\nConstantinople, May 4.

Lists\nof houses, with notes on the kind of\nloot to be found therein, were discov\nered.

Since the\ndeposition of Abdul Hamid there haa\nbeen an exodus daily of the women of\nthe imperial harem from the Yildiz\nKiosk. Forty-five carriages, each con\ntaining two or three women, left the\ncity yesterday and 15 more were seen\nproceeding to Stamboul today.

Grounds\nNot Work of Man.\nThe amphitheater of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific\nexposition has been ac\ncomplished partly by human efforts,\nbut for the most part the work hns\nbeen done by nature. On the high pre\ncipitous shores of Lake Washington,\nlooking across a succession of bays,\nand snow topped peaks of the Cascades\nare brought clearly into view and this\nforma the back ground of the amphi\ntheater stage. Three sides rise from\nthe floor and these have a stately up\nward slope; only in the development of\nthese natural seating placet has it\nbeen necessary for work to be ex\npended. About the tiered sides of the amphi\ntheater chain rise one above the other\nand in the vast forest theater 30,01)0\npeople can have comfortable and\nsightly positions. Surrounded at the\nback and sides to towering trees of\nDouglas fir and massive cedar, the\nplace seems to have been crented by\ngiants of old for spectacular events;\nit is so fashioned and designed that\nopen air acoustics produce results\nwhich could be generally looked for\nonly within the walls of structures\nbuilt with this property always in\nmind.\nIt was in this spot that the first\nshovel of earth waa removed in the\nbuilding of the Aliwka-Yukon-Piieific\nexposition. ithout any work of pre\nparation, 2",000 people were easily ac\ncommodated within its borders.

Amazing statistics\nwill be presented to the National Peace\nsociety, which convenes here today, by\nBenjamin F. Trueblood, secretary of\nthe American Peace society. In a re\nport compiled for distirbution among\nthe delegates It is asserted that 15,\n000,000 persons have sacrificed them\nselves in wars since the beginning vl\nauthentic history.\nThis vast number of victims, says\nMr. Trueblood, "is about equal to ail\nthe people who inhabited the globe for\nthe last 600 years, allowing\' three gen\nerations to the century and 650,000,000\nestimated population of the world at\nthe opening of the Nineteenth century\nas the average population per genera\ntion.\n\'The usual estimate of the number\nof men lost in the wars in the Nine\nteenth century, including those who\ndied of wound and diseases, places it\nat 14,000,000. Of this number the\nNapoleonic campaigns are responsible\nfor about six million.\nLosses in the American Civil war\nhave been variously estimated at from\n800,000 to 1,000,000 men.
