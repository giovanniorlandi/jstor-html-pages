Several publishers are\ncompeting for the honor of giving\nthe book to the world, knowing that\nthere is money* in it. This Musolino\nalso knows, and demands 100,000 lire,\nwith 20 per cent royalty.\nThe Italian continues .to worship\nat the shrine of Musolino. Commit\ntees of women have been formed in\nFlorence, Lucca, Aquilla, and other\ntowns for the purpose of obtaining\nsignatures for their petition to the\nqueen demanding the brigand\'s par\ndon. The police have just seized a\nmanifesto signed by a number of\nwomen, which set forth that Italy\nis tired of brawnless men and wants\nto see at the head of the government\nreal men like Musolino. The mani\nfesto concludes with these words:\n"After Garibaldi, the noblest son of\nItaly is Mnsolino."\nProf. Lombroso, the psychologist,\nwhen asked to explain this feminine\nenthusiasm for a vulgar murderer,\nsaid: "Great crimes always exer\ncise a fascination for women, espe\ncially if the crimes have an apparent\nromantic or chivalrous aspect. Three\nfourths of the women live in the\nmiddle ages, and Musolino is a figure\nof the middle ages."\nIt has transpired that during the\nI fiyst ten days of his trial Musolino\nreceived\'. 3/JÛ0 let! ers from women.!\nwoods I\'ll knock him over to-mor\nrow,\' says he,\n" \'Bully for you!* says we.\n"Next day, Tong in the forenoon,\nthe young chap went out with his\ngun. He met Simon\'s Sam a mile in,\nan\' Sam steered him to where he had\ntied the bear, a couple o\' miles fur\nther in. The young chap paid Si\nmon\'s Sam the $15, and Sam said he\nhad better wait half an hour or so,\ntill Sam could git out o\' the woods,\n\'cause somebody mowt happen to see\nhim there, an\' suspicion the deal.\n"The young chap sot down an\'\nwaited, quite a good ways from the\nbear, an\' the bear acted ugly an\'\nyanked at the rope an\' snarled at\nthe young chap, an\' the young chap\ngot nervouser an\' nervouser. By an\'\nby he couldn\'t wait no longer, an\' he\nhauled up an\' blazed away at the\nbear. He must \'a\' been tremendous\nnervous, for he missed the bear an\'\nshot the rope plumb in two.\n"The bear gave a jump, an\' away\nhe went with somethin\' like six feet\nof rope hangin\' from his neck, an\'\nwas out o\' sight in the thick laurels\nbefore the young chap could think\nto fire at him ag\'in. He follered\nalong after the bear till he see there\n%varn\'t no use, an\' then he give it np\nan\' come in.\n" There\'s a bear in them woods,\'\nsays he, an\' I got a shot at it.

You ought\nto have it to take along with you,\'\nsays he to the young chap.\n" \'Ought to have what?\' says the\nyoung chap, snappy like.\n" \'The big, fat bear I killed to\nday,\' says Rube.\n"The young chap didn\'t say any\nthing for a spoil, an\' then he says:\n" \'How much do you want for it?\'\n" \'Bears like that un is fetchin\'\n$25,\' says Rube. \'It\'s worth $30, but\nI\'ll take $25,\' says he. \'Here comes\nmy two hoys, now, sneakin\' it in on\nthe stone drag.\'\n\'An\' so they was, an\' the bear was\na nice, fat, glossy one, sure enough,\n" \'Well, says the young chap, \'I\ncome here to git a bear, an\' I s\'pose\nI\'ll have to take this one or go back\nskunked,\' says he.\n"An\' he paid Rube $25 for the bear.\n"There w r as a funny thing about\nthat bear,\' says Rube, by an\' by.\n\'It was goin\' to commit suncide.\'\n"We all snickered.\n"Then what did it have that rope\n\'round its neck for, I\'d like to\nknow?\' says Rube, grinnin\' till his\nmouth \'most tetched his ears. \'The\nbear had a long rope \'round its neck\nwhen I run ag\'in him, an\' he acted\nto me jest exac\'ly as if he was look\nin\' for a good place to string him\nself up as I socked him with both\nbar\'ls an\' gethered him in,\' says\nRube. \'He\'d heerd I was in the wood,\nI s\'pose, an\' knowed he mowt jest as\nwell make way with hissef as to\nhave me do it for him,\' says Rube,\nwith that all-pervadin\' grin splittin*\nhis face.\n"The young chap didn\'t say noth\nin\'; but if his looks had been killers\nwe\'d \'a\' all fell dead.

G. Cam\nbell Morgan on Personal Con\nsciousness of God —The\nPower of the Cross.\n"The universal sympathy of the\nworld is one of the most hopeful signs\nof the coming of the kingdom of\nHeaven on earth," declares Rev. Dr.\nJoseph K. Mason, of Chicago. "When\nthis same compassion toward the un\nfortunate is called forth, not by the\nunusual, as in this sad event, but by\n\'the poor, who are always with us,\'\nit will be a happy day for humanity.\nSuch calamities are not the evidence\nof Divine wrath, as some are saying,\nbut the token rather of an impartial\nbenevolence and wisdom. The calam\nity of the comparatively few, dread\nful as It is, is the salvation of the\nmany, for volcanoes are nature\'s\nEafety valves.\n"We shall learn some day not to defy\nthe laws of God in nature and in mor\nals. \'All things are ours\'if we are on\nGod\'s side, but if we build our cities on\nthe sides of volcanoes or our nations\non corrupt and selfish principles which\ndisregard the rights of the people, or\nour personal characters on defiance of\nconscience, which is the voice of God\nwithin the soul of man, we must ex\npect calamity and suffering."\nIn conclusion, the preacher spoko of\nthe tender sympathy all men must feel\nfor the sufferers in such a calamity\nas that of Martinique, and of the de\npressed sense of responsibility coming\nto those who dwell in lands where such\nvisitations of nature are unknown.\nMan\'s True Greatness.\n"The recent horror in Martinique,"\nears Rev. L. A. Crandall, D. D., "com\npels a pause and serious thinking\nabout man\'s boasted greatness. With\nthe coming of a new century we have\nbeen busy recounting man\'s victories\nover the forces of nature; now nature\nwipes out of existence 30,000 people in\n30 seconds of time, as if to compel\nrecognition -of her supremacy. Man\nbuilds woncterful bridges, rears mag\nnificent cities, binds steam, chains\nelectricity, but. when nature puts forth\nher useful forces the works of men\ngo down in utter ruin. Man\'s great\nness cannot safely be built upon the\nplace which he occupies in the uni\nverse. This world, which is his home,\nis but an insignificant speek : among\nthe countless worlds which hang in\nspace. Man himself is but for a little\nhour and then goes down to decay\nand dust. No wonder that the psalm\nist, looking upon the wonders of the\nstar-sown sky, cried out: "What is\nman that thou art mindful of him?\'\nMan\'s true greatness lies in the fact\nthat the Infinite is mindful of him."\n"The volcano is now a phenomena,"\naccording to Rev. Johnston Myers.\n"Earthquakes have rocked the world\nagain and again. The cyclones have\ndesolated the dwellings of men. The\nfloods have swept away cities and\ntowns. The burning sun has made a\ndesert of the gardens. The cold has\nfrozen the harvests. God has not given\nns a secure place in this world. He has\ndeclared that "we have here no con\ntinuing city." We act, however, as\nthough we were to remain where we\nnow live. This life is only the frag\nment of life. We treat it as though it\nwere all. We build and plan as the\nchildren in the sand upon the sea shore,\nonly to have the next wave destroy our\ntoys. In view of death coming to us\nsuddenly and in some unexpected way\nwe would keep in close relation to the\nChrist who conquered death."\n• * • •\nBusiness and Religion.\n"Can a business man succeed In\nbusiness if he conducts his business\non Christian principles?" asks Dr. C.\nM. Coburn, a Chicago pastor. In reply\nto his own question he declared: "He\ncan succeed in rio other way. Can\nevery business man succeed, then, in\ngetting $10,000,000 who conducts his\nbusiness on Christian principles? No,\nbut most men will get as near to it\nas if they conducted their business on\ndifferent principles. It is not abso\nlutely necessary to be honest in order\nto keep poor. The deacon who said in\nmeeting: \'Brethren, I\'ve been a tryin\'\nfor 40 years to serve the Lord and get\nrich both to onct, and I tell you, it\'s\nmighty hard sleddin\',\'would probably\nhave been on the county if he hadn\'t\ntried to serve the Lord.\n"I never knew a man to fail simply\nbecause of his honesty and integrity.\nThe Bible agrees with common experi\nence in the teaching that the chances\nof success in business are not de\ncreased, hut largely increased, if a man\ncarries his religion into his bnsiness.\nAnd his accumulations are likely to\nstay in the family longer.\n"Integrity has a commercial value,\nA man who has a reputation of being\nan honest man and a true Christian\nhas a better chance of getting on his\nfeet again when he falls down. He will\nnot commit suicide; he will say his\nprayers and with a brav# heart try it\nagain. A man in such a coadition does\nnot suffer so much from hi# liabilities\nas from his unreliabilities.\n"The man who lives according to\nBibl# rules will be temperate, frugal,\nprompt, energetic, \'diligent in busi\nness.* He will not speculate with other\npeople\'s money or use his own in gam\nbling or dissipation. He will be free\nfrom the \'moral cracks\'through which\nso many fortunes leak away. He will\nbe courteous and considerate of those\nwhom he employs and will attend to\nhis employer\'s interests as if they were\nhis own. In every time of strain he\nwill have the quietude and strength\nand hopefulness that a man always has\nwho believes his steps are \'ordered of\nthe Lord,\' and this is a great reserve\nforce to push one to success.\n"The fact is, as somebody has said,\n\'God Almighty has fixed things in this\nworld so that it pays to do right.\'\nRighteousness has the promise of the\nlife that now is as well as that which\nis to come. Men with a genius for\nbusiness can succeed financially on un\nChristian principles, but the same man\ncould probably have made as great or\ngreater success if he had been Chris\ntian in his dealings. And it must not\nbe forgotten that even financial suc\ncess cannot, be fully measured until we\ntake into account what becomes of the\nmoney and what effect it has had upon\nthe children and family of the man\ncalled successful."\n• • • •\nConaclousneai #f God.\n"With the incoming of the Christ\nlife, the fact of God is brought from the\nrealm of the speculative into that of\npersonal consciousness, "is a thought\nbrought out by Rev. G. Cambell Mor\ngan. "The one overwhelming truth is\nGod, and all other experiences are\njudged and placed by their relation\nthereto. The fact of God may not al\nways be the uppermost in the mind\nof the Christian. He will not neces\nsarily always be mentally repeating\nhis belief, nor will he be constantly re\nminding himself of that belief. These\nexercises prove weakness rather than\nstrength of conviction. There will be\na constant consciousness of God\nwhich will flash out into restrictive\nand expansive application through all\nthe various circumstances of the ever\nchanging days.\n"How wonderfully this was true in\nthe life of Jesus may be discovered by\nreading through the Gospels, especial\nly those of Matthew and John, and tab\nulating His references to His Father.\nIt will be discovered that He lived a\nlife conscious of the presence of His\nFather, submissive to the authority of\nHis Father, and confident in the wis\ndom and power of His Father. All the\ncircumstances of the days, and all the\nvalues of words and deeds, and all the\nissues of life were tested and tried in\nthat consciousness. To all those in\nwhom Christ lives there comes the\nsame consciousness, and it produces\nlike effects.\n"The life thus homed in God enters\nupon new views and new feelings. The\nfirst and basal change is intellectual.\nThe God consciousness proves much.\nRemembering that the God of whom\nthe Christian is conscious is God re\nvealed in Christ, it will at once be seen\nhow the enlightened intelligence rests\nin the fact of his perfect justice.\nMists and mysteries may still en\nshroud the appearance of the hour,\nbut the Christian knows that eternal\njustice holds unceasing vigil and\nmetes out unswerving truth. Though\nthe method may seem strange, the is\nsue is assured, \'The Judge of all the\nearth will do right.\' Yet this is not\nall. Christ has spoken to men from\n\'the bosom of the Father,\' and the\nheart of the Christian knows that\nmercy is as truly the way of God as is\njustice; knows, moreover, that in the\ngreat mystery of the cross these have\nmet, so that now justice operates in\nmercy and mercy delivers in justice.\nThis issues in the assurance that in\nspite of all the appearances of the\n\'things that are near\' God\'s victory is\nassured, and so there is ever in the\nheart of the Christian the triumph\nsong of the day that is coming, and\nthrough all the ooDflict of to-day he\nendures as \'seeing him who is invisi\nble.\' The result of this is a new moral\nconsciousness. All life being set in\nthis new relation to God, then man be\ncomes \'keen of scent\' in his fear. The\nbeauty of holiness and the deformity\nof sin are clearly seen. Righteousness\nis now seen in its larger issue in the\nvictory of God, and sin in its deeper,\ndoom as defeated by God. Then all\nconduct is measured, not by the satis\nfaction of the sensuous moment, but\nby its relation to the eternal verities.\nNow the things that appeared only\nharmless and of little account to near\nsightedness are seen to be of mighty\nmoment when seen in the perspective\nand proportion of the eternities."\n• • • •\nEternal Punishment.\nRev. W. K. Newell, of the Chicago\nMoody Bible Institute, spoke on\n"Eternal Punishment," huthis sermon\nfor the most part took a brighter\nturn. Among other things, he said:\n"The book of John was written for\nthe purpose of leading people the\nway of sqjvation.\n"Because you belong to a religious\nfamily, go to church, and give money\nto the poor, does not mean that you\nare saved. You must be born again.\n"Let me say to the unsaved that\nwhen you get in the Christian spirit,\nChrist increases and you decrease.\n"Salvation is so simple that folks\nmiss it.\n"You can\'t find fault with God for\npunishing sinners. You would find\nfault with the mayor and police of\nChicago if they did not punish the\nlawbreakers.\n"It\'s an ugly stubborness in the\nhuman heart that causes unbelief. If\nthere is an honest soul to-day that\nwants light God\'s going to give it to\nhim.\n"When I find a man who says h#\nhas never done anything wrong I\nstamp him as absolutely ignorant or\nviciously a hypocrite.\n"If you won\'t have eternal life you\nwill have the alternative—the wrath\nof God."\n• * # •\nThe Power of the Cross,\nText.—For I determined not to know any\nthing among you save Jesus Christ and Him\ncrucified.—1 Corinthians, 2:2.\n"It was a hazardous thiDg for th#\napostle to announce this to the Corin\nthians," declares Rev. S. Parkes Cad\nman, D. D., in a sermon written for\nthe New York Witness. "They were\na people who rejoiced in a va\nriety of gifts and were eager\nto express themselves in mani\nfold ways. Breadth of view and inclu\nsive sympathy seemed to be necessary\nin order to succeed among them. They\nwere prone to turn away from the\nChristian system and were especially\nsensitive to \'the offense of the Cross.\'\n"St. Paul made this bold assertion\nof the compelling theme of his minis\ntry among them, because he perfectly\nunderstood them and was determined\nto bring their acts and habits and as\npirations beneath the unifying power\nof a great principle, which was the\nmoral and spiritual dynamic of the uni\nverse, the solution of all mystery, and\nthe clarifying of all aim. People who\nturn away from systematized religion\nto-day are the intellectual children of\nthese proud Corinthians, inheriting\ntheir weakness as well as their\nstrength. Men and women are found\neverywhere who possess capacity for\nthe right and its doing, and indigna\ntion against any form of wrong. In\ntheir various walks of life they follow\nafter an ideal; they know the nobility\nof self-repression and of labor for the\nsocial estate; they are kindly, honest\nand gracious, but they tell us that the\nevangelical faith has poverty-stricken\naspects and neglects some things\nwhich are all important to them, be\ncause apart from them they could not\nlive their lives."\nDr. Cadman claims that there are\nseveral predominating features in this\nannouncement of St. Paul which will\nhelp us to understand each other bet\nter. For most of the differences which\nvex our progress are due to the dim\nness of our earthly vision, and St. Paul\nurges upon us his voluntary dedication\nof all knowledge beneath the superior\nknowledge of the power of the Cross,\nbecause\nFirst, he says, nothing is discarded\nwhich is legitimate, minor themes are\nnot lost but they are absorbed in the\nmajor one. A second point he makes\nis that "the power of the cross is the\npower of a fact." The explanation of\nthat fact we may only attempt, but\nthe fact itself shines steadily on, un»\nhindered by warring statements.\n"But, further, the power of the crose\nis happily expressed in the text, in the\ncombination of the person of Jesue\nwith the principle of sacrifice. *\nAnd lastly, the power of the cross,\nas we survey the future, is a multiply\ning power. There are two classes of\nreligious forces, those which absorb\nand those which are absorbed by them,\nand the cross is the supreme absorb\nent, whose vitality, always recurring,\ncan never be impaired. Rest assured,\nyou cannot exaggerate this statement\nand there is no need to qualify it. It\nis the legitimate generalization of\nChristian manhood, Christian thought\nand Christian effort. While dialectic#\nchange and literary fashions decay,\nthe pledge of the permanence of the\ncross is in the person who died there\non and in the need of man for the bene\nfits of that passion and death.\nLet us dismiss our fears and weep\nnot for the Cross Bearer, but for our\nselves and for our unfaithfulness and\nour lukewarmness. For did all\ntongues fail and all prophecies cease,\nthe holy hill of Golgotha would send\nout afresh new light and truth. There\n6hall we keep our tryst with men and\nwith the Father of men, and if we\nfail, God will raise up ministers and\npeoples which appear dumb as the\nstones of the streets, and they that\nare far off He will bring nigh, until\nthe work has been completed, which\nis pledged by the very manner of it«\nbeginning to completion. Then shall\nthe High Priest of our profession prof\nfer unto God the Father Himself the\nKingdom thus recreated, and having\ndelivered it up, God shall be all and in\nall."\n• * e •\nGist of Many Sermons.\nTn the divine sight unselfish exist\nence is life; selfish existence is death.\n—Rev.

JUNE 26, 1902.\nThe Republicn party\'s history\nfrom the close of the Civil War is\nan almost continuous chapter of\nscandals. At every opportunity i\nat\nit has raided the public Treasury.\nIt has made thousands of unnec\nessary offices and filled them with\nparty hacks and henchmen who\nhave done dirty work for the party.\nIt has favored all reforms and vio\nlated every law which was enacted\nto inaugurate or enforce them. It\nhas wasted the publio moneys in\nevery oonceivable manner which\ningenuity can suggest or corrup\ntion invent. During the Spanish\nWar speculation entered into al\nmost every Government contract.\nFavorites were enriched at every\ntouch of the public service. The\narmy was abused by appointing\nunworthy persons to office, which\nweakened the efficiency of the ser\nvice and imperiled the lives of the\nsoldiers who had answered the\ncall for volnnteers. Ignorance\nand inefficiency and even corrup\ntion have been overlooked or con\ndoned. The Constitution has been\nviolated, the laws disregarded,\nauthority usurped. A country\nhas been siezed on the plea that\nour Republican Administration\nbought it and holds the inhabitants\nthereof were covered in the bill\nof sale. Millions upon millions of\nmoney have been expended and\nthousands of soldiers have been\nkilled or have died in hospitals or\nin insane asylum. Thousands of\nFilipinos have been slain; their\nharvest destroyed, their homes\nturned into ashes. The national\nAdministration this day is fighting\nto make subject, not free men.—\nAnd all this is not in conformity\nwith the Constitution, the laws, the\npolicy or past history of country ;\nbut is open violation of all.\nIf the Republicans as a party\nwere really desirous of affording\nrelief to the people why does not\nthe Republican Congress pass a\nbill removing the duty from for\neign meats? This would lower\nthe price of meats to consumers\nin a single day. But the Repub\nlican Congress declines to inter\nfere with the enormous profits of\nthe meat trust and declines utterly\nto take off the tariff on foreign\nmeats. It thus protects its friend,\nthe meat trust, and in return will\nexpect the trust to raise it a big\ncampaign fund for use in the con\ngressional Districts this fall.\nThe government is trying to do\ntoo much. It has taken on func\ntions that belong exclusively to\nprivate enterprise and has made\nmany useless offices at great ex\npense. The prevailing civil ser\nvice system is one of the most\nglaring frauds that efflicted the\ncountry. If the civil service re\nformers would devote themselves\nas assiduously to weeding out the\nbarnacles and superanuates in\nthe public offices as they do to the\npromoting of a class system they\nmight be of some use to the coun\ntry.\nThe greatest evil that ever af\nflicted the United States is the\npension evil. It is a shame and a\ndisgrace that a government should\nbe imposed upon in any such way.\nIt does seem that the government\ncould protect itself against such\nfrauds. Instead of matters get\nting better they are getting worse.\nCongress should pass some strong\nlaws for the protection of the\ntreasury and quit playing the cow\nard act and pandering to the Fed\neraf so ldier. _\nIf Arizona, New Mexico and\nOklahoma were not believed to be\nsafefy Democratic the Republican\nSenate would not have postponed\nthe consideration of the bill for\ntheir admission to statehood until\nthe next session of Congress.\nThree tons of American silver\nwill be shipped to Porto Rico to\nbe used as currency.\nEvery Democratic convention\ndenounces the Dingley tariff, the\nbreeder of trusts. _\nin\ned\nto\nBoston syndicate.\nLatest News.\nFour million tons of Alabama\ncoal will be exported to Italy.\nThere was no session of the\nUnited States Senate Saturday.\nKing Albert, of Saxony, died\nat Dresden at 8:06 last Thursday.\nThe cotton mills at Bluff City,\nTenn., have been purchased by a\nJames Devoe was crushed to\ndeath in a flour mill in Harford\ncounty, Md., Saturday.\nThere was a slight frost in the\nlow places through Nodaway\ncounty, Mo., Friday night.\nMrs. Elizabeth Paul, aged 70\nyears, was so frightened by a fire\nin Cambridge, Md., that she died.\nA Sioux City, Iowa, dispatch\nsays heavy frosts were experienc\ned throughout that section Friday\nnight.\nThe Southern Cotton Buyers*\nAssociation will oppose all meas\nures permitting pooling by rail\nroads.\nIn consequence of sickness J.\nW.

It did not\nspring from any intelligent de\nmand of the people. It grew out\nof a spirit of vengence. It was ad\nvocated for the purpose of pun\nishing the people of the South and\nof perpeuating the rule of the\nRepublican party. It became a\npart of the Constitution by fraud\nand force, executed on the ground\nthat they were necessary to secure\nresults of the war. The war for\nthe Union was not fought to se\ncure negro suffrage. The history\nof the world may be searched in\nvain for a parallel to the spirit of\nsavagery which inflicted upon a\ndefeated and impoverished peo\nple the unspeakably barbarous\nrule of a servile race just liberated\nfrom bondage. Negro suffrage\nwas a crime against the white peo\nple of the South. It was a crime\nagainst the blacks of the South.\nIt was a crime against the whole\ncitizenship of the republic. Pol\nitical power never was conferred\nupon a race so poorly equiped to\nexercise it."\nLast year the cost of governing\nLondon was about $80,000,000.\nThis is several millions less than\nit costs New York to be governed\nunder a reform administration.\nArkansas is the fifth lumber\nproducing state in the Union.

Nearly\neverything was lost, including\nout houses. Thd fire originated\nfrom a defective flue.\nWe are shocked to learn of the\nhorrible fate of the little three\nyear old daughter of Mr. Jud\nCochran, of Bradley, Ark. It\nseems that the little girl, in her\nchildish play, had wandered to\nthe over-dangerous railway track.\nUnconscious of the danger of the\napproaching train, she was crush\ned to death by the iron monster.\nThe remains were gathered up\nwith loving hands and laid away\nat the family cemetery. We ex\ntend our sympathy to the grief\nstricken hearts that mourn, but\nlet not your lives be filled with\nvain regrets, but remember that\n"of suchi8 the kingdom of Heav\nen.\'\'\nQuite a number of citizens of\nwards 3 and 4 are at Benton this\nweek attending Court.\nMr. H.

Well, you know, "you can\'t\nkeep a squirrel on the ground."\nIt is so easy to see the evil of\nthe world and to raise a cry about\nit. But the world has not been\nmade by those who thought it only\nbad. It is they who saw the good\nness in it, and loved it and hoped\nfor it who have been, since Christ\'s\nday, its true regenerators. The\nsaying, * \' tell me what you think of\nother people, and I will tell you\nwhat I ought to think of you," is\nonly a way of saying that a man\'s\nview of the world is necessarily\nlimited by his own character.\nTake a man who is suspi\ncious, who always suspects others\nof meaning or doing deceitful\nthings, and you may be pretty\nsure there is a cloud upon his own\nlife. Or hear a man constantly\ncrying out against the ingratitude\nof the world, and it is more than\nlikely that he has not done much\nto be grateful for. It is not usually\nthe best people in the world who\nare loudest or cruel est in their in\ndignation against sinners; it is apt\nto be those who secretly are sin\nning themselves. Y ou remember\nDavid and Nathan. David flashed\nforth fiery words against the\nscoundrel who had taken the poor\nman\'s Iamb, little dreaming how\nclose the point of the parable was\nto himself. "And Nathan said,\n"Thou art the man." But as\'it\nis the penalty of sin to suspect sin\nin others, so it is the reward of\ngoodness to know that others, too,\nare good .—Memphis News.\nSays Thomas a Kempis : "En\ndeavor to be always patient of the\nfaults and imperfections of others ;\nfor thou hast many faults and im\nperfections of thy own, that re\nquire a reciprocation of forbear\nance. If thou art not able to make\nthyself that which thou wishest to\nbe, how canst thou expect to mold\nanother in conformity to thy will?\nBut we require perfection in the\nrest of mankind, and take no care\nto rectify the disorders of our own\nheart; we desire that the faults of\nothers be severely punished, and\nrefuse the gentlest correction of\nourselves."\nThe Vermont Republican State\nconvention at Montpelier split\nand each faction nominated tick\nets.

The\nwire is easily handled by drawing it\nover the ground with this simple de\nvice.—W.

The home should\nhav ? an abundance of apples for use\nThrough Senator Minch, our coun\ncil has succeeded in getting a law\npassed by the New Jersey legisla\nture, on forest fires. A law that we\nurge all good citizens to understand\nand sustain.\nFriends of forests in other states\nmay do well to seek similar legisla\ntion in their respective common\nwealths. Animal and plant life and\nhealth are so dependent on forest\nconditions, as influencing climate,\nthat forestry is an interstate ques\ntion. It is also such a question in\nrespect to streams for water power,\nand for navigation. For prevention\nof floods and the regulation of rain\nfall. The rainfall section of it alone\nis one of many millions a year to\nany one of the United States. If\nrain comes at the right time a farm\ner may clear say $300 a year more\nthan if not so coming. Every 10,000\nsuch farmers in that state have $3,\n000,000 annually at stake. Similar\nfigures apply to climate respecting\nsickness. A citizen of a town, as\nwell as a farmer, may lose $300 by\nsickness that would be prevented by\nwise forest regulation. Forest foli\nage is the chief protection from ma\nlarial enemies in the air; and the\ngreat dispenser of healthful oxygen.\nForests are the main and practical\nly the only regulation of rainfall.\nFire is the greatest of the many\nenemies to the forest. The person,\nor the corporation, starting such a\nfire should suffer severe penalties\nTo this end our forest council has\nsecured the passage of the law re\nferred to. VYe believe it to be one\nof the best ever enacted for this\npurpose. It will repay citizens to\nunderstand this law and sustain it.\nThe great work for good citizens,\nunder it, is to secure investigation of\nforest fires, and see that each town\nship committee selects a fire marshal\nLocal civil engineers are often the\nbest men for marshals.\nCitizens of other states not hav\ning good laws protecting from for\nest fires should demand similar ac\ntion to that of New Jersey from\ntheir respective legislatures, and then\nsustain the same. Forest fires are\nusually of far more damage than\nthey are assessed for.—George May\nPowell, President New Jersey Forest\nCouncil.\nScarcity of Hired Help.\nThe continued scarcity of hired\nhelp is not an unmixed evil. The in\nevitable result must be machinery in\ndoors and out; better business prin\nciples will be applied; greater atten\ntion given to that which is of most\nworth, useless and unprofitable work\ndispensed with. When stern neces\nsity compels one to rest from la\nbor awhile, he will find that there is\na deal of unprofitable and awkward\nwork done indoors and out, and that\nmany hours have been given to toil\nthat might better have been used in\ndevising ways to accomplish the same\nend with less work.—Farm and Fire\nside.\nuntil winter apples are ready, and\nthere is no better way of getting\ngood varieties than by grafting.\nTrees should be planted where want\ned, > and then get scions from trees\nIn the\' neighborhood if there are va\nrieties that pleasje. Then it makes\nno düfeisaçe whether ->oe has thi\nname correct or not\nHealth will come with all its blessings to those who know the way, and it is mainly a ques\ntion of right-living, with all the term implies, but the efforts which strengthen the system,\nthe games which refresh and the foods which nourish are important, each in a way, while it is\nalso advantageous to have knowledge of the best methods of promoting freedom from unsani\ntary conditions. To assist nature, when nature needs assistance, it is all important that the\nmedicinal agents used should be of the best quality and of known value, and the one remedy\nwhich acts most beneficially and pleasantly, as a laxative, is—Syrup of Figs—manufactured by\nthe California Fig Syrup Co.\nWith a proper understanding of the fact that many physical ills are of a transient char*\nacter and yield promptly to the gentle action of Syrup of Figs, gladness and comfort come to\nthe heart, and if one would remove the torpor and strain and congestion attendant upon a con\nstipated condition of the system, take Syrup of Figs and enjoy freedom from the aches and\npains, the colds and headaches and the depression due to inactivity of the bowels. In case of\nany organic trouble it is well to consult a competent physician, but when a laxative is required\nremember that the most permanently gratifying results will follow personal cooperation with\nthe beneficial effects of Syrup of Figs. It is for sale by all reliable druggists.
