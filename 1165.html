        <pre>["“The struggle fo r  South Africa looks more and more like a frontal contest between \nthe militant forces o f  resistance and revolution and the mobilized and unbending armed \nforces o f  the status quo. . . . South Africa is perilously near the slippery slope o f  foil-scale \nviolence. . . . ”\nSouth Africa: Coercion and Demands for Change\nBy K e n n e t h  W. G r u n d y\nProfessor of Political Science, Case Western Reserve University\nB\necause  of the current high levels of violence \nand coercion, security is South Africa’s \npreeminent preoccupation. The government \nis doing all it can to restabilize or reassert its control \nover the polity—short of a full-scale war on its oppo\xad\nnents, the abdication of power, or a major reform \nleading to a transition to black rule.\nPolitical divisions among whites center on how to \ndeal with the black resistance. Divisions in the black \ncommunity focus on how to conduct the struggle for \nchange. Even South Africa’s foreign policy is increas\xad\ningly an adjunct to its domestic struggle for order.1\nDespite the government’s initiatives and its use of \nforce, there is growing resistance to minority rule. By \nvirtually all measures of unrest—deaths, beatings and \nacts of intimidation, strikes, “incidents,” protest actions, \nguerrilla or “terrorist” activity, the spread of weap\xad\nons, security force deployment, detentions and arrests, \nemigration, forced removals, bannings and restriction \norders, new and more repressive laws and regula\xad\ntions—the tension mounts.2 Life has changed for the \nblack residents of townships and homelands; buffeted \nby the major contestants, who insist that they take \nsides and conform, they are left without physical pro\xad\ntection. Yet the authorities still see the situation as \nmanageable, although they have not figured out how \nto maintain control.\n'See Kenneth W. Grundy, “ Regional Coercion for \nDomestic Domination: South Africa’s Militarization at Home \nand Abroad” (Paper presented to the conference on Mili\xad\ntarization in the Third World, Queen’s University, Kings\xad\nton, Ontario, January 15-17, 1987).\n2 Weekly Mail (Johannesburg) regularly publishes an \n“Apartheid Barometer” of data on the security situation.\n3Eugene Terre’ Blanche quoted in The Star (Johannes\xad\nburg) (weekly air edition), June 2, 1986, p. 15.\n*The Star (weekly air edition), June 23, 1986, p. 15. \nEmpirical data from South Africa, especially survey data, \nmust be regarded with suspicion. They are offered here only \nfor lack of more reliable information about public opinion.\n5Mark Orkin, Disinvestment, the Struggle, and the Future: \nWhat Black South Africans Really Think (Johannesburg: Ravan \nPress, 1986), p. 50. Orkin’s study was prepared for the \nCommunity Agency for Social Inquiry with the Institute for \nBlack Research.\n6Ibid., p. 33.\nMeanwhile, virtually all segments of society have \ncome to accept the view that their lives and fortunes \nare a product of the manipulation of coercion. They \nsee their problems at base as issues of power, which \nthey narrowly define in coercive terms.\nA form of Gresham’s law of militarism applies: the \ncooperative, negotiable and compromisable are driven \nout by the violent and assertive. Moderation and tol\xad\nerance are in retreat. When people expect violence to \n“ settle” conflicts, then they prepare for violence. \nSpokespersons for virtually every political group and \nfaction have expressed themselves in bellicose terms. \nThe African National Congress (ANC) talks of “peo\xad\nple’s war.” The South African Defence Force (SADF) \nsays it has not yet begun to use its muscle. The extreme \nright wing shouts: “Touch the Boer nation and we’ll \nblast you until you are level with the ground!”3 Lead\xad\ners in neighboring states likewise prepare for the worst; \nand even those who claim to favor nonviolence are \nforced to defend themselves.\nPublic opinion polls demonstrate that people have \nadopted this frame of mind. An early 1986 survey of \nwhite opinion indicated that 71.1 percent of the whites \nthink that a Namibian-type guerrilla war will even\xad\ntually develop in South Africa.4 In a similar 1984 sur\xad\nvey, 62.8 percent shared that opinion. Nor are whites \nconvinced that the SADF can maintain its control. \nOnly 26 percent “definitely agreed” that the unrest \ncan be contained indefinitely. Some two-thirds of those \ninterviewed felt some confidence in the security forces. \nOnly 28.5 percent of the white respondents felt that \n“South Africa’s blacks have a good reason to take up \narms against the Government”; the percentages were \neven lower among National party (NP) supporters \nand those to its right.\nIn a related but not comparable 1985 survey among \nurban blacks, 80 percent of the respondents agreed \nthat “compromise is no longer possible; . . . the next \nstep must be a unitary arrangement in which all blacks \nand whites together vote for their leaders, to partici\xad\npate without regard to race or group in one central \ngovernment.”5 Because they demand what the white \ngovernment is pledged to prevent, 36 percent favored \narmed struggle against the government.6\n197\n", '198 CURRENT HISTORY, MAY, 1987\nThe government has responded to this challenge in \ntwo ways—one relatively subtle, the other crude. First, \nthe government has sought to identify and engage what \nit calls “moderate” blacks in the administrative and \nenforcement process. In the same vein, the govern\xad\nment has sought to initiate reform of the obviously \nunacceptable apartheid system. Homeland officials, \n“ elected” township councillors, the black business \ncommunity, government employees, particularly the \nsecurity and education establishments, mixed race \n(Coloured) and Indian members of Parliament, and \nsome conservative church leaders have been enlisted \nin the effort to restabilize the country. To entice them \ninto this risky association requires that the govern\xad\nment make concessions that might defuse the tension \nor win over those not committed to revolution.\nOf course, the government is under pressure from \nits own white constituents not to weaken their ulti\xad\nmate grip on the country. So the government enacts \nminimal reforms, hoping that each step toward “power \nsharing” will enable it to tamp down the resistance. \nTo date, the government has not hit upon a remotely \neffective formula. There is plenty of speculation about \nhow far the government is prepared to go to change \nthe apartheid system. This speculation itself neutral\xad\nizes some fence hangers who think that the govern\xad\nment may yet dismantle apartheid piecemeal and \npeacefully. Some of the celebrated reform measures of \nthe last few years—the tricameral (white, Coloured \nand Indian) Parliament, the introduction of various \n“elected” local governing bodies, the end to “influx \ncontrol” and the hated pass laws, the promise to end \n“forced removals,” the repeal of the prohibition on \nmixed marriages, the restoration of South African cit\xad\nizenship to some eight million blacks who were deprived \nof citizenship when “independence” was conferred on \ntheir homelands—have achieved little black support \nfor the regime. What little support the reform strategy \nonce enjoyed seems to have been dissipated in recent \nmonths.\nThe second element of the government’s policy is \nthe effort to display its resolve to reestablish order, \neven if this requires a full panoply of coercive and \nviolent measures. Simply put, the NP government \nseems determined to do what it thinks it needs to do\n7 Weekly Mail, vol. 2, no. 50 (December 19, 1986-Tanuary \n8, 1987), pp. 7-8.\n8Nicholas Haysom, Mabangalala: The Rise of Right-Wing \nVigilantes in South Africa (Johannesburg: Centre for Applied \nLegal Studies, University of the Witwatersrand, 1986); and \nJeremy Seekings, “Vigilantes and the State,” Work in Progress \n(Johannesburg), no. 40 (February, 1986), pp. 26-29.\n9See the revealing article by Jo-Ann Bekker, “An Illus\xad\ntrated Guide to Public Ignorance,” which tries to demon\xad\nstrate the effects of changing censorship regulations on the \npress from 1980 to 1987, in the Weekly Mail, vol. 3, no. 5 \n(February 6-12, 1987), pp. 14—15. See also the Weekly Mail, \nvol. 2, no. 49 (December 12-18, 1986), pp. 1 and 3.\nto retain power. Perhaps the government felt that it \nhad things well in hand in February, 1986, when it \nlifted the partial state of emergency that had been in \nforce in specified “unrest areas.” But resistance groups \nseemed to take heart. Although they had suffered under \nthe emergency and many of their leaders had been \ndetained, affiliated organizations of the United Dem\xad\nocratic Front (UDF) behaved as if they had taken the \ngovernment’s best punch and remained standing.\nA variety of organizations, especially youth groups, \nused the ending of the emergency to mobilize. They \nturned funerals into political theater, claimed the \ntownships as theirs, and openly set up people’s parks, \npeople’s courts and “liberated zones” in the town\xad\nships. In fact, the security forces were still at hand. \nThe authorities reasserted dominance on June 12 (just \n4 days before the tenth anniversary of the Soweto \nuprising). The government issued a second state of \nemergency, this time for the entire country. This \nemergency was altogether different. “We’re not kid\xad\nding,” warned the Bureau for Information. Detention \nsweeps were comprehensive and efficient. Some 20,000 \npeople were apprehended in the first four months. \nThe security force presence in the townships was \nexpanded. Any sign of resistance was squelched.\nNew press regulations were pronounced; many crit\xad\nics were silenced; and intra-black violence was pro\xad\nmoted. At first, the emergency and its rigorous \nenforcement seemed to work. The killing rate fell \nsharply, from 6.31 per day when the emergency had \nbeen lifted, to 2.27 after the full-scale emergency had \nbeen declared. In that sense the emergency “worked.”7\nEMERGENCY\nEventually, the regime’s opponents recovered. \nEmergency II did not really restore peace. It man\xad\naged to suppress some street violence temporarily. \nUncoordinated, anomic violence was replaced by the \nviolence of vigilante bands hostile to the resisters and \nsupported by the authorities.8 Emergency II has given \nthe government the upper hand, but official (and some \nunofficial) regime violence has replaced revolutionary \nviolence.\nIt is extremely difficult to find out what is happen\xad\ning. Media constraints enable the government to shield \nSouth Africans and the outside world from the reali\xad\nties. For example, in December, 1986, “official data” \nsuggested that 1,831 people had been killed in the \nunrest since September, 1984. A conservative report \nby the South African Institute of Race Relations puts \nthe figure at 2,291. Other estimates are higher. Sim\xad\nilar discrepancies apply to other quantitative data and \nto accounts of events.\nAs the law stands, the news media, including for\xad\neign correspondents, are not allowed to publish unau\xad\nthorized accounts and commentary on civil unrest and \non the protests against apartheid.9 It is a crime to\n', 'South Africa: Coercion and Demands fo r  Change 199\ncriticize the government’s handling of the political cri\xad\nsis. All reports of violence, strikes, boycotts and pro\xad\ntest meetings, except for official accounts, must be \nsubmitted to the Bureau for Information for “clear\xad\nance,” that is, prior censorship. Individuals who make \n“subversive statements,” very broadly defined even \nin private communication, are subject to prosecution.\nRemarks that “discredit or undermine compulsory \nmilitary service,” for instance, are “ subversive.” \nAdditional controls on the media make journalism a \nrisky profession. These controls are so rigid that even \nthe opposition political parties that work within the \nparliamentary system have complained that their can\xad\ndidates for the May, 1987, elections cannot discuss \nthe issues fully nor can they campaign without pos\xad\nsibly violating the law. In their eyes, they are “gagged.”\nTHE FLUIDITY OF BLACK POLITICS\nThe government clampdown has severely divided \nthe black community. This is not because many blacks \nsympathize with the government, but because they \ndisagree on how best to counter the government’s \nmoves, or because they are too frightened to carry the \nstruggle further. Certain patterns of political change \nare apparent.\nFirst is the growing legitimacy of the African National \nCongress (ANC) among the black populace and in \nthe outside world.10 ANC officers held official meet\xad\nings with top British and United States executive \nbranch personnel in 1986 and 1987, including a con\xad\ntroversial session between United States Secretary of \nState George Shultz and Oliver Tambo, the ANC \npresident. At each stage of the mounting resistance, \nthe government accuses the ANC of coordinating the \nprotests and brands the resistance as foreign con\xad\ntrolled. And by its acts, the government focuses atten\xad\ntion on the ANC. For example, the May, 1986, \ngovernment raids on ANC facilities in Botswana, \nZambia and Zimbabwe and the publicity associated \nwith these raids played into the ANC’s hands.\nTo be sure, the number of armed attacks within \nSouth Africa attributed to the ANC has risen steadily. \nYet it would be wrong to argue that the dominant \nthrust of ANC policy is the escalation of violence. The \nANC’s strategy of “people’s war” is a protracted \nstruggle embracing all forms of action. Structural order \nis a must, and political activity—including mass \nresistance and armed strikes—requires that forces and \nunderground political machinery be built up over time. \nThe ANC also seeks to build unity among all seg\xad\nments of the black community.\nAt every turn, the government accuses the ANC of\nl0See the Washington Post, December 14, 1986.\n11 Hansard Debates (House of Assembly), February 7, 1986, \ncol. 419.\nl2Weekly Mail, vol. 2, no. 48 (December 5-11, 1986), pp. \n12-13.\ndirecting a unified struggle and threatens to leave no \nstone unturned in rooting out its leaders. Frederik van \nZyl Slabbert, former leader of the progressive oppo\xad\nsition in Parliament, put it accurately: “ It is not the \nexternal ANC that is radicalizing the internal situa\xad\ntion. It is the internal situation that is radicalizing the \nANC.” 11\nDomestically, the popularity, vitality and staying \npower of the United Democratic Front are apparent. \nThe UDF is South Africa’s largest antiapartheid coa\xad\nlition, an umbrella body with around 850 affiliated \norganizations that boast 2.5 million members. Yet the \nUDF is hard hit by the tightened security. Despite its \ncommitment to nonviolence, virtually its entire top \nnational and regional leadership is in jail or in hiding. \nIn addition, the UDF has been designated an “affected \norganization,” thereby barring it from overseas fund\xad\ning and placing additional restraints on its operations. \nYet the UDF carries on, with thousands of covert yet \nnonviolent activists in the affiliates. The state insists \nthat the UDF is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, holding \nthat it is the internal agent of the banned ANC. So \nfar, the government has not been able to prove that \ncharge in an appellate court.\nAn interesting but probably stillborn experiment to \nbridge the impasse is being played out in Natal prov\xad\nince. There, after 8 weeks of hard bargaining, an \nagreement was reached by 24 of the 37 delegations to \nan Indaba, a high-level conference. Participants are \nseeking a multiracial, regional government for Natal \nand the black homeland of KwaZulu. The innovative \nset of proposals includes a bicameral legislature—a \n100-member lower chamber elected on the basis of \none person, one vote by proportional representation, \nand a 50-member upper chamber with 10 seats each \nfor black Africans, Indians, Afrikaners and English- \nspeakers and 10 seats for people who do not wish to \nbe classified racially or culturally. The proposals include \nan executive branch that includes majority and minority \nparties and a division of powers between the KwaNatal \ngovernment and Pretoria.\nExperimentation may be necessary to save South \nAfrica, but the plan was quickly rejected by the Natal \nleader of the NP. It did not, he said, provide for “effec\xad\ntive and equal powersharing.” 12 Later, at the opening \nof Parliament in 1987, the state President offered a \nmore definitive rejection of the plan.\nThe Indaba was probably doomed from the start. \nThe major forces in the struggle for South Africa, \nAfrikaner nationalism and radical black nationalism, \nwere not party to the agreement. They refused to par\xad\nticipate, although the NP opted for observer status. \nThe constellation of radical black organizations—ANC, \nUDF, the Pan-Africanist Congress and the black con\xad\nsciousness groups—rejected invitations from the out\xad\nset. They regard the Indaba as a maneuver to prolong \nwhite control by bringing in the Zulu-based Inkatha\n', '2 0 0 CURRENT HISTORY, MAY, 1987\nmovement of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Indian \n“collaborators.” The Afrikaner cultural and commer\xad\ncial organizations that participated in the Indaba either \nrefused to sign the agreement or abstained. Presum\xad\nably, they retain the long-standing Afrikaner concern \nthat English-speaking whites might enfranchise the \nblacks and then ally with them to end Afrikaner \ndomination.\nDespite the enthusiasm for the Indaba plan among \nliberal South Africans and some conservative Amer\xad\nicans, and the effort to market the plan as a “mod\xad\nerate,” “centrist” first step approach to change, the \nplan is predicated on racial identity and is not non- \nracial. Thus the black majority (except for the Zulu \nleadership) sees it as a scheme to evade majority rule \nin a unitary South Africa.\nFar more pernicious is the government’s attempt to \ndivide and play on fears within the black community \nby setting black against black. One such effort was \nthe formation beginning early in 1985 of armed police \nforces under the authority of the black township coun\xad\ncils. These forces are partisan instruments supporting \nestablished black township factions. Regarded as \n“collaborators” by regime opponents, they nonethe\xad\nless offer insecure black officials a measure of legal \nmuscle to wage war on their political enemies.\nVIGILANTE VIOLENCE\nAdditional muscle has emerged in the form of the \nincreasingly open activities of black vigilante groups.13 \nMuch of what the media call “black-on-black” con\xad\nflict is, in fact, the extra-legal violence of right-wing \nvigilantes. The ties between these groups and the \nstructures of apartheid, especially the security forces, \nare lost in the sensationalist coverage. Although there \nis some factional and tribal strife, the designation of \n“black-on-black” is by itself misleading.\nAccording to Nicholas Haysom, although vigilante \ngroups display specific local characteristics, they share \nseveral common features. First, in most cases they \nemerged late in 1985. Second, they target almost \nexclusively the opponents of apartheid and homeland \nrule. Third, they operate brazenly, with what many \n(including the vigilantes themselves) regard as police \nsupport and the blessing if not the support of the \nregime’s local black authorities.\nVigilantes are mobilized against the background of \nthe collapse of existing administrative and “elected” \nstructures in urban townships and the emergence of \npockets of resistance to homeland rule. Official secu\xad\nrity forces in many instances have proved to be coun\xad\nterproductive. Official coercion contributes to social \nsolidarity and opposition to community councils.\n13See Haysom, op. cit.\n14See Chris Vick, “The Improbable Allies and the Impas\xad\nsive Foe,” Weekly Mail, vol. 3, no. 3 (January 23-29, 1987), \np. 9.\nIn some instances, vigilantes have proved more \neffective in dealing with popular protest, and the gov\xad\nernment can claim innocence when blacks are killed. \nUnlike regime violence, which is often indiscriminate \nand random, vigilante violence is specific and focused, \ntargeting those identified with opposition groups. Vig\xad\nilantes also play on local fears and disenchantment \nwith life’s disruptions and sometimes the indiscipline \nof the township youths. Some township residents believe \nit is in their interest to support the vigilantes.\nThe much publicized “battle for Crossroads,” the \ngigantic squatter settlement outside Cape Town, is \none example. Between 60,000 and 70,000 people were \nleft homeless and their entire settlement was razed in \ntwo days of intensive fighting. Bands of armed vigi\xad\nlantes, the so-called “ witdoeke” (white scarves), \nallegedly with the aid of the police and the SADF, \nrouted the more radical and antigovernment “com\xad\nrades” from those areas of Crossroads where they held \nsway. It was “the fastest and cheapest forced removal” \never. Black fighters achieved what government bull\xad\ndozers had failed to do. People fled, and today Cross\xad\nroads is being rebuilt according to the state plans so \nlong resisted by the residents. Approximately 25,000 \n“original settlers” will be allowed to stay—the rest \nare being forced to move to Khayelitsha, a township \nsome 30 kilometers from Cape Town.\nDivisions in the black community are also exacer\xad\nbated in complex homeland political contests. In \nKwaNdebele, for instance, the bloody struggle over \n“independence” came in the form of factions within \nthe Legislative Assembly and the use of a feared vig\xad\nilante group, the Imbhokoto, associated with the \nKwaNdebele minister of home affairs.14 The political \nstruggle is complicated, involving two senior or royal \nhouses of the Ndebele, business and farming interests \n(including white farmers), non-Ndebele residents in \nKwaNdebele, plus the interests of the Pretoria gov\xad\nernment. After more than 100 deaths, including high- \nlevel assassinations, and much property destruction, \nthe Assembly voted in August to rescind a 1982 unan\xad\nimous decision to accept “independence” from South \nAfrica.\nIn sum, nearly every feature of local and regional \nblack politics is infused with confusing and diverse \ninterests. It is not always a simple black against black \ncontest. And Pretoria relishes these divisions and uses \n(Continued on page 224)\nKenneth W.

The police had been summoned to the campus \nby the vice chancellor in response to peaceful student \nprotests, and they reportedly fired indiscriminately on \nthe students. The news of the killings provoked out\xad\nrage and sympathy demonstrations on a number of \nother university campuses, leading to further confron\xad\ntation and violence and several more student casual\xad\nties. Although the government immediately appointed \na commission of inquiry, its liberal reputation was \nfurther damaged when it quashed a planned sympa\xad\nthy demonstration by the Nigerian Labour Congress \non June 4 and detained 7 of its leaders for 11 days. \nIn its July White Paper on the commission report, the \ngovernment dissolved all student unions for the \nremainder of the academic year and rejected the rec\xad\nommendation that the police not be sent to campuses \nwith lethal weapons in the future.\nIn October, the nation was further stunned by the \nassassination by parcel bomb of one of Nigeria’s most \ntalented, innovative and fearlessly independent jour\xad\nnalists, Dele Giwa, editor-in-chief of Newswatch mag\xad\nazine. The 39-year-old Giwa founded the magazine in \nJanuary, 1985, with three other leading newspaper \neditors, and it quickly became a popular sensation. \nGiwa’s biting commentaries and relentless pursuit of \nthe truth through investigative reporting had fre\xad\nquently landed him in trouble with the police and the \ngovernment.\nCircumstantial evidence, including their extraor\xad\ndinary defensiveness and intimidating warnings to the \npress, links top security officials to the assassination. \nBut whether or not elements of the state security \nestablishment were involved in Giwa’s assassination, \nit is clear that the authoritarian impulse did not die \nwith the overthrow of the Buhari-Idiagbon regime. \nNo doubt, military and security officials in key posi\xad\ntions remain apprehensive about any liberalization, \nand particularly the mobilization by trade union, stu\xad\ndent and other popular organizations that it might \nunleash. These officials would prefer to see such inter\xad\nest groups tightly controlled and licensed by the state \nthrough some kind of corporatist arrangement. They \nshare with some intellectuals and bureaucrats a deep \ndistrust and dislike for the turmoil and divisiveness \nof a multiparty system. They value order and stability \nover freedom, and probably would prefer to institu\xad\ntionalize some kind of bureaucratic-authoritarian \nregime.\nThe democratic transition to. which President \nBabangida has committed himself reflects the plur\xad\nalistic character and liberal aspirations of the country, \nand would seem for now to be difficult to reverse. But \nas with most other transitions in which the military \nleaves by its own choice and timetable, its completion\n17For some specific suggestions on constitutional change, \nsee ibid.\nis far from guaranteed and the success of any future \ndemocratic system is far from assured. The issue of \nconstitutional structure is important: the new consti\xad\ntution must put in place more effective and autono\xad\nmous structures for checking and correcting the abuse \nof power.17 But public accountability will be difficult \nto institutionalize in a new democratic regime if its \npredecessor has not begun to establish a precedent. \nThis is why the current military regime must install \nan independent apparatus that can monitor its con\xad\nduct in office. It is also why so many Nigerians believe \nit is important that Dele Giwa’s killers be found and \nconvicted. ■\nS O U T H  A F R IC A\n(Continued, from page 200)\nthem, when it can, to control the pace and direction \nof change. At base, however, the government cannot \nhold back the tide—the demands for majority rule \nand for black power.\nTHE WHITE RESPONSES\nIn turn, the strategies for dealing with black \nresistance bedevil and divide the white citizenry. The \nwhite polity is increasingly fragmented at three levels.\nFirst, at the partisan-parliamentary level, what was \nonce a relatively neat two-party system, a liberal \nopposition against a conservative government, has \nbecome complicated by the entry of two parties to the \nright of the ruling NP. Both the Conservative party \n(CP) and the Herstigte Nasionale party (HNP) have \nperformed well in by-elections and, as a result, have \nforced the NP to try to undermine their appeal. The \ngovernment’s gestures and concessions to the right \nmake serious reform nearly impossible. The right wants \nto preserve racism and apartheid. The 1987 elections \nin May should be important. The NP is assured a \nmajority in the white Parliament, but the election will \nreveal the gravity of the right-wing threat. It is pos\xad\nsible that the CP or a CP—HNP alliance (a formal \nelectoral merger was rejected in late January) may \nreplace the liberal Progressive Federal party as the \nofficial opposition.\nOutside Parliament, in the second arena of white \npolitics, the government’s challenge from the right is \nserious and sometimes violent. The Afrikaner Weer- \nstandsbeweging (AWB), a neo-Nazi movement, man\xad\naged to break up an NP meeting in Pietersburg in \nMay and, in response, President Pieter Botha addressed \nan NP rally in Potgietersrust behind razor wire and \nrows of armed police. Perhaps these events exaggerate \nright-wing support, but the NP has seen its majorities \nshrink, first in the rural Transvaal constituencies and \nlater in blue collar urban areas. The NP seems con\xad\nfused about its next step.\nFinally, there is a great deal of jockeying with regard \nto policy within the government and the NP itself and\n', 'Articles Concluded 225\nin the executive branch. The security establishment \nhas taken center stage on security matters, and \nincreasingly it has brought the government to see \nsecurity ramifications in virtually all policy areas.15 \nThe civil service cannot always be counted upon to \nimplement policy directives.\nAlso at the central government level, the State \nSecurity Council has assumed the role of an inner \ncabinet. The SSC implements policy through its Works \nCommittee and various interdepartmental commit\xad\ntees. The SADF, the Department of Defense, Military \nIntelligence, the National Intelligence Service and the \nSecurity Police exercise inordinate influence. Even at \nprovincial, regional and local levels, these groups are \npowerful. The comprehensive network of the National \nSecurity Management System permits the security \nforces to operate vigorously in policymaking and in \npolicy coordination and implementation. This “shadow \nstate structure” exists alongside the government’s \nbureaucracy. It is responsible only to superior security \nbodies in the hierarchy.16\nThus, Parliament, political parties, and the Cabi\xad\nnet are in danger of being eclipsed. The struggle for \nSouth Africa looks more and more like a frontal con\xad\ntest between the militant forces of resistance and revo\xad\nlution and the mobilized and unbending armed forces \nof the status quo. The ultimate polarization of politics \nmay be delayed, deflected or complicated by the appeals \nof those who wish to seek a less violent resolution, but \nthese groups are losing credibility and influence. Such \ngroups may be necessary later, to facilitate a solution \nafter the struggle has run its course. But for now, they \nseem powerless to prevent the violence all sides pro\xad\nfess to abhor.\nIf this analysis is correct, South Africa is perilously \nnear the slippery slope of full-scale violence, where \nadvocates of moderation and compromise themselves \nbecome the targets, regarded as traitors to their \nrespective peoples and causes, and where the man\xad\nagement of violence becomes the coin of power. ■\nl5Kenneth W.

Zimbabwe has committed approximately 9,000 \ntroops to guard the route, and Tanzania has report\xad\nedly committed at least 1,200 men in Mozambique. \nMalawi has offered sanctuary to RENAMO insur\xad\ngents, although this aid was scaled back when the\n8“A U.S. Policy Toward South Africa,” p. 15.\nfront-line states threatened retaliation. Under these \ncircumstances, the Mozambican conflict has the \npotential of escalating into a general regional conflict, \nwith possible external intervention.\nDILEMMAS OF UNITED STATES POLICY\nIt is impossible to develop an effective policy toward South \nAfrica without taking into account the broader regional \ncontext. U.S. officials must recognize that efforts to build \npositive relationships with South Africa have been sig\xad\nnificantly damaged by the failure to deliver a long-prom\xad\nised settlement in Namibia and the decision to provide \nmilitary support for Jonas Savimbi’s UNITA in Angola.8\nThat statement by the Advisory Committee’s report \non South Africa highlights the basic paradox of United \nStates policy: at the time when the United States took \na historic stand against apartheid, which should have \ndramatically enhanced its prestige and influence in \nthe region as a whole, it supported a host of conflict\xad\ning policies which, in African eyes, place United States \ninfluence in serious question.\nAt a January meeting of ministers representing the \nSouthern African Development Coordination Confer\xad\nence (SADCC)—an economic group consisting of \nAngola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, \nSwaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe—baf\xad\nflement was expressed over contradictory American \npolicies toward the Marxist governments of Angola \nand Mozambique. While the United States had com\xad\nmitted more than $5 million to help Mozambique \nrebuild its sabotaged railroad lines, it vowed to aid \nSavimbi’s rebels, who destroyed Angola’s key rail link.\nThat is not the greatest inconsistency. The United \nStates has no diplomatic relations with Marxist Angola, \nbut it provides some economic support to Marxist \nMozambique. However, aid restrictions permit assis\xad\ntance only to the private sector, in spite of Maputo’s \neconomic reforms, its bids for foreign and private \ninvestment and its pragmatic approach to South Africa.\nContradictions also underlie United States rela\xad\ntions with Zimbabwe, a country that professes Marx\xad\nism but has adopted a mixed economy and promotes \nracial reconciliation. In July, 1986, Washington ended \na $20-million aid program after a junior member of \nZimbabwe’s Cabinet criticized United States policy \nat an American Independence Day reception while \nformer United States President Jimmy Carter walked \nout in protest. Although the Zimbabwean government \nwas responsible for a rude breach of diplomatic pro\xad\ntocol, the United States overreacted. State Depart\xad\nment officials said that the refusal of Prime Minister \nRobert Mugabe to apologize led to the aid cutoff, \nwhich was announced just as Mugabe was playing \nhost to leaders of the 101-member Nonaligned Move\xad\nment in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe.\nThe United States had been Zimbabwe’s largest \naid donor, providing $350 million since independence\n']</pre>
