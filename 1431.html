The statement b not\ninfrequently heard on the streets of\nour city that "Business is poor,"\n"u - ii i\'h.iui. j-:..- i\nmui icy scarce, nuuimg uumg,\netc., when as a matter of fact we\narc surrounded by mines of undevel\noped resource to an extent which\nshould put the City and County\nhigh on the list of wealth producing\nmd wealthy communities.\nBut how shall It be accomplished?\nWhat the first move in the game by\nwhich the Greater Pascagoula shall\nbecome a reality? How shall we so\nabout it to turn our dormant wealth\ninto active and spendab\'e wealth?\nwnere the Master Mind to lead us\nout of the condition of chaotic slug\ngishness and unprofitableness into\nbetter ways and pleasanter paths?\nEveryone wants the city built up to\nthe absolute limit of its possibility\nand given a place on the map of the\nState and County of which we may\nfeel justly proud, and which will\nmake the name Pascagoula known\nthroughout the world as a great and\nindustrious metropolis. But again\nthe question How shall it be done?\nYou may not believe it, but the\nmost important move is one so very\nsimple, and easy, that any failure of\nthe City of Pascagoula to become\nthff SVnnt fi In lmnArt.n4i\'\n" Vkwilll , illlVI Ibli\non the Gulf Coast can only be at\ntributed to blindness, or ignorance,\nor laziness.\nThis master move the one which\n\'hall open the campaign auspiciously\nand insure the successful consuma\ntion of our hopes, is simply to stop\ndeclaring that it cannot be done and\ninsist that it not only can bt, but\nB be done and that I shall belp\nao it. With this positive attitude\non the part of every citizen, his next\nmove will be open his eyes to de\ntermine what part he can have in\nthe upbuilding of the community\nhat definite action toward creating\nthe Greater City is for him: and it\nshould quickly become apparent that\nto plant a few pecan trees or orange\ntrees b the next move for him, and\nnot a difficult one at that. If the\nowner of every piece of property\nwithin the limits of the Greater\nPascagoula were to plant ten trees,\nand give the necessary are to bring\nthese trees to the bearing stage\nfour years for oranges and ten years\nfor pecans when that time arrives\nPascagoula would find itself one of\nthe wealthiest communities in the\nwhole country second not even to\nPasadena, California, which is now\nconsidered the wealthiest city per\ncapita in the United States.\nOne need only inspect the nine\nacre grove of A. G. Delmas Sons,\nlocated almost in the heart of the\ncity, and learn from the owners as\nto the earning capacity of that grove\nfrom year to year, to be able to de\'\ntermine for himself how vast a vol\nume of money would within a few\nyears be in circulation or safely to\nthe credit of our industrious citizens\nwho had proven their wisdom and\nforesight by following the example\nof the Messrs Delmas.\nHow many vacant lots are worth\nless at present, so far as income is\nconcerned, but which could be given\na most substantial value if cleared of\npine shrubs and stumps and a half\ndozen grafted pecan trees planted\nand properly cared for.\nIn France, a Persian (English)\nwalnut tree, if in full bearing, has a\nrental value of $3.86, which is 7 per\ncent on 1S5 and walnuts selling at\n7 cent a pound wholesale. And\nwhen a piece of ground is rented\nfor farming purposes at a certain\nprice, the walnut trees are always\ncounted and the rental based on the\nnumber of bearing trees on the land.\nThe time will come in this locality\nwhen a pecan tree will be valued on\ndead," sj our material activity as\nsuggested above is not sufficient of\nitself; there must be a live interest\nin any and everything that may di\nrectly or indirectly have any influ\nence in bringing about the desired\ncondition the Greater City. Many\npresent tendencies on the part of\nsome of our people must be corrected.\nIt is frequently heard around the\nstreets that there b so strong a feel\ning of jealousy between the present\ncity of Pascagoula and the city of\nMos Point, that any activity or de\nvelopment which might benefit the\nTOLSTDIS\nEE1K3 FULFILLED.\nHaw The Farmer\'s Daughter May\nEarn Pin Money.\nPromised the Annajsddoo, But\nIn 1913 Instead cf 1314.\nWashington, Sept. 10.

The volatile and\nhigh-heating cannel coals have a\nlarge proportional amount of resinous\nmatter In the formation of coals of\nhigher rank a sort of distillation takes\nplace, brought about for the most\npart by movements within the rarth\'s\ncrust, such,\' for instance, as have\nformed the Appalachian mountain\nsystem. As a result of this natural\n.lutillation the aftiount of volatile\nmatter in the coal becomes less.\nThe teslns are reduced, probably\nleaving a part of their carbon within\nthe coal. In the highest erade coals\nthe resins apparently arc obliterated\nas snch.\nTo those interested in the matter,\neither scientifically or commercially,\nthe paper w ill prove of value as ex\nplaining the reason for certain quali\nties and characteristics of various\ntypes of coal. A copy of the paper\nmay be obtained free of charge by\nwriting to the Director or the United\nStates Geological Survey, Washing\nton, t). c.\nConcerning the formation and source\nof coal there have been many and\nivergent opinions. It is now gen\nerally conceded th.it coals of various\nranks, from lignite to bituminous\nnd anthracite, are derived from\npeat. The vegetation going to make\nup the peat ranges from minute\nplants floating about upon the sur\nace of a bog to large trees. These\nplants, on dying, settle to the bot\nom of the bog, where, mainly\nthrouh the the agency of bacteria,\nthey decay, The partial decay of\nthe vegetable matter anJ its consoli\nd.ition forms peat. Through still\nfurther consolidation the peat forms\nlignite, and this in turn, as the result\nof various processes, forms coals of\nhigher rank.\nMany are known to exude gums\nand resins, especially when injured\nwell-known fossil form of such\nresin is amber, in which insects are\nfrequently found embedded, having\nbeen caught and imprisoned by the\ngum while it was still soft. In the\nmore recent coals of loverrank fossil\nresin occurs in abundance, in the\nform of small lumps or flakes. In\nthe coals of higher rank resins are\nnot readily seen, and their occur\nrence in such coals has been doubted.\nIt has been supposed that these\ncoals were formed from a different\ntype of vegetation in which resin\ndid not occur. In a recent publica\ntion of the United Stales Gerjlogic.il\nSurvey, Professional Paper 83-b,\nDavid White discusses at length\nthe occurrence of resins and gums\nin coals and proves that they are\npresent nor only in the coals of the\nWestern States of both high and low\ngrade, but in the old Paleozonic coals\nof the Eastern States. Mr. White\'s\nconclusions are of partidula interest\nas showing that the high and low\nrank coals were derived from similar\ntypes of plants and differ only in the\ndegree of alteration of the vegetable\nmatter from which all coals are de\nrived.\nIn the paper the course of the resin\nat is followed from the living plant to\nIIS elimination in mc mu-iaim\ncoals. The amount of resin in peat\nand in the coal subsequently formed\nare is largely determined by the amount\nthe of decay of the vegetable matter.\nThe resin, being the most resistant\nPeace, Peace, Still There Is No\nPeace.\n"Peace, peace and there is no\npeace!"

Lately, however,\nthe leaves of this sturdy young oak\nhave begun to turn yellow andsere,\nthe branches have commenced to\ndroop and now only one of its lithe\nyoung arms remains green.
