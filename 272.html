WINFIELD JONES, WASHINGTON, March 9.—(Special, Correspondence). — Senator Boies, Penrose, of Pennsylvania, probably, the most outstanding and powerful, figure in the senate, is back on the, job. Consequently there is consider, able satisfaction in the Republican, ranks in the senate, where Penrose, iB a real leader of the majority, rank, ing with Lodge, Curtis, Smoot and, others of the big men in the upper, house., For many months, until recently,, Penrose was a very sick man. He, was confined to his Philadelphia, home with a serious -complains and, there were alarming reports from, time to time that his condition had, become dangerous. These reports, caused much anxiety among his col, leagues in the senate, the more so, after the Republican victory last No, vember, following which the Republi, can majority in the senate wanted |, Penrose on hand in the next congress, to guide the destinies of the party. I, Senator Penrose has now partially, recovered his health and is in his!, place every day at the senate. Every, body at the capitol hopes it will not, be long before the Pennsylvania, warhorse has completely recovered, his old-time vigor and is himself, again. At one time it was reported, in Washington that the only thing, that was keeping the Pennsylvania, senator alive was his tremendous, will power. At any rate he is back, in his accustomed place and there is, general rejoicing in the Republican, cohorts. Senator Penrose has so far, regained his strength that he was, able to practically dominate the, course of the emergency tariff ball in, congress. As chairman of the power, ful senate finance committee this, work naturally fell into his hands,, and in the next congress he will have, a great deal to say in preparation, and passage of the permanent tariff, bill., Senator Penrose has long been one, of the most influential men in the, senate and over since he has been, chairman of the finance committee, has been able. In many instances, to, take a more prominent part in taxa, tion and tariff matters than almost, any other senator of either party in, the senate. In the next congress he, will undoubtedly keep up his record, for good work in tariff and taxation, matters for the benefit of the country, and the people., The senate finance committee is, \' the most important and powerful, committee in the whole senate or, ganization. This is but natural as, this committee has jurisdiction of, all tariff and taxation matters. As, chairman Senator Penrose wields a, tremendouse power, not only in the, committee but in the senate., Senator \' Penrose is a native of, Philadelphia, a graduate of Harvard, of the class of 1881, practiced law, in Philadelphia for several years aud, began his political career in the, Pennsylvania house of Representa, tives in 1884, four years after he left, college. He served in the Pennsyl, vania state senate, and was presi-\', (lent protempore of that body twice.1, He has been a delegate to every j, Republican national convention for, the past twenty years and was a j, member of the Republican national, committee for eight years. He was, chairman of the Republican state, committee of Pennsylvania in 1903-04,, was elected to the senate to succeed, J- Donald Cameron in 1897 and has, since served in the senate for nearly, a quarter of a century,. In every, election for the senate, during that, time Senator Penrose has been vig, orous, even bitterly opposed by cer, tain Pennsylvania factions, including, one once headed by Gifford Pinchot,, but in every contest has emerged a, victor. There is probably no senator, iu the country who has a firmer hold, on his state and his constituents and, it is safe to say that Senator Pen, rose will serve in the senate, if he, desires, as long as he lives., In many Republican nationar ad, ministrations Senator Penrose has, been importuned to take cabinet, seats but has invariably preferred to, remain in the senate He has been, prominently mentioned for the stand, ard bearer of the Republican party, in presidential campaigns, but has, always refused to be drafted for, these exalted positions., Having been in public life so long,, from such a great state as Pennsyl, vania. and having such a vast experi, ence in congress and in the very, prominent positions he holds in the, senate Mr. Penrose, by common con, sent has come to be one of the three, or four acknowledged chiefs of that, party, and probably more than any, other man is responsible for the, presidential nominees, policies, and, government of the now dominant, party., VARIETY OF TOPICS, IN NEW ALASKA BOOK, Another Alaska author has sprung, up in the person of John U. Ander, son, of Wrangell, who is writing a, real history, a dramatic combination, of adventure, pleasure, courtship,, love, horrors and tragedy, which will, later be published and offered for re, production to the moving picture cor, porations. The title of Mr. Anderson\'s, book is, “From the Cradle to the, Grave." The work is now about com, pleted and a copyright will be ap, plied for at once. Mr. Anderson has, lived in Alaska for many years and, knows Alaska from Ketchikan to, Nome. His book will no doubt be an, interesting contribution to Alaskan, literature., Shamrock Club dance, March 17,, Eagle Hall., Professional kodak finishing. Scar, borough.

Then it ought to, expect the same sort of service from, employes that is exacted in private, business, at fiiis time when the tax, payers of the country are bending, under burdens whicli threaten to, break the back of productive enter, prise. In the establishment of work, ing conditions the government ought, • 1o be a model employer hut uot a, mere easy mark., Under the present system the hours, for employes in the Washington de, partments are seven and a half. Prom, this a half hour goes for lunch at, noon, and most of the departments, have a system of rest periods (luring, the remaining working hours, aggre, gating a half hour additional. This, reduces the work hours to six and a, half. In many offices it takes fif, teen minutes to get down to work, after the hour of assembling, and fif, teen minutes to get ready to quit and, get out of the building. Every na, tional holiday is celebrated by ces, sation of work; if the holiday comes, on Sunday, Monday is taken. The cus, torn gnew up under the last ad, ministration of dismissing the de, partments a half day in advance of, the holiday, but a protest was made, when this was underaken last Christ, % inas, and President Wilson issued in, structions forbidding this innovation., \'^\'During the three summer months, "Saturday half holidays are given,, During the past few years there have, been many special holidays., ^Thirty days leave with pay is given, each permanent employe, and thirty, days additional sick leave, with pay., Methods of administering sick leave, differ in different department, but, in some of them the system is sim, ply made the means ol\' getting an, other month’s vacation with pay., In addition to all this there are, many offices in Washington in which, many employes spend “working’, hours in reading magazines anti, newspapers, gossiping and otherwise, loafing on the job. This condition, continues, despite the protests ol, members of congress and others., If half of the employes in the, Washington- departments were dis, charged, and the other half required tc, work as hard and as long as the, average American taxpayer, the gov, ermnent’s work at the capital woulc, he better done, and. what is ever, more important, the “graft” spirii, which such methods as this inculcate, would he eliminated from many quar, t.ers where it has been running, strong., A generalization of this kind o, course should he modified by th<, statement that many governmenl, employes at Washington render con, soientious service. More than any, one else such employes are inter, ested in reform of the present sys, tem, which puts a premium on lazi, ness and inefficiency. They do no, resent atacks on abuseB they ar<, not. helping to perpetrate., > The new administration could d<, i no more wholesome or more popular, \' thing than to sweep out of the de, partments at Washington not grad, ually, but with all the promptness, possible, every loafer and slacker,, and require the employes remaining, to give value received for their aal, , aries. The search for loafers and, \' slackers should of course not be con, , fined to AVashington, but extended, to every bureau office throughout the, country where there is room for sus, picion that similar conditions prevail., It will require little less than an, earthquake to shake the barnacles, ! loose, but such a shake-up is abso, ! lately necessary. The people of this, j country have grown weary of that, j sort of officialism which expends, | its energies not in trying to render, j better service to the public, but in es, tablishing laws and practices making, it certain that the people are going, to be imposed upon by payroll para, sites who regard labor of any kind, j as a curse to he as little endured as, j possible., THE RETURN T-RACK, From many competent sources in, j widely separated sections comes the, I opinion that the United States has, j now definitely entered upon its re, | turn to normal conditions. The avef, I age business man has come to see, j that continuance of war-time pros, j parity, with its attendant circum, : stances of credit inflation, high, wages, high prices, reckless spend, ing and public and private waste, is, impossible. He has come to see, also that the black-pessimism of a, few months ago is unjustified by any j, intelligent estimate of the economic |, situation.

Hathef, he said, it was due to a failure to,, enforce such regulations., In all Alaska, it was pointed out, by the speaker, there are only about, a dozen game wardens, and it is, impossible for them to patrol such a, vast territory with any effect. Game, is being slaughtered in great num, bers and offenders have become so, confident they will go unpunished, ^hat^they practice their illegal killing, openly., Scores of additional game ward, ens will he required to hold these, lawbreakers in check, and congress, will he asked early in its session to\', fake the necessary steps in that di- <, rection.

Cecil of, Portland, who has just returned from, that country., Mr. Cecil reports that the storm of, January 29 covered an area of some, 30 miles wide by 75 miles long,, stretching from Clallam bay south, westerly to Bear, Tyee and Forks,, thence southeasterly towards the, Queets and Quinault river water, sheds. “Estimates of the damage—, and these estimates at best can be, only guesses at this time—run as, high as eight billion feet; of this!, probably 10 to 15 per cent occurred, on the Olympic national forest," re, | ports the district forester, but he em, ! phasizes that although these prelim, j inary estimates may be greatly ex, aggerated that there is no question, whatever as to the calamitous char, acter of the storm., “So far it has been impossible to, j get anything like reliable estimates, i of the damage done,” says Mr. Ce, cil. “All roads and trails are blocked, by fallen timber and it will probably, be months before the area can be, | opened even to the meager means, of travel which existed before the, storm.”, Foresters have considered the west, side of the Olympic mountains as the, safest fire belt in the northwest, but, Mr. Cecil emphasizes the fact that, within a few hours on January 29,, it has been changed into one of the, greatest possible forest fire hazard, through the impenetrable mass of, fallen timber. While most of the, timber blown down is outside of the, national forest and privately owned,, still the extent of the damage is so, huge that in Mr. Cecil’s opinion it is, going to call for absolutely united, i action on the part of every private, owner, the state of Washington, and, the United States forest service to, salvage some part of this loss and, to prevent forest fires from get, ting started., DOROTHY DALTON STAR, IN \'HIS WIFE’S FRIEND’, AT EMPRESS TONIGHT, Mystery stories in the movies have, largely been left to the badly jum, bled serial picture. But in “His, ‘Wife\'s Friend,” starring Dorothy Dal, ton, and which is showing for tonight, only at the Empress, Thomas H. Ince, has produced a highly interesting, piece of work, in which a baffling, .murder case is mingled with a double, romance that is more than ordinarily, interesting., The suspense is well sustained., The lonely castle, the solitary play, er, and the diabolically clever Orien, tal, lend a peculiar fascination to a, thoroughly dramatic and well de, veloped play. Miss Dalton has, proven her place among the front, ranks of emotional actresses of the, screen, and makes the most of the, exceptional opportunity afforded by, this production., In connection with the drama, one, of the two-reel Mack Sennett “side, splitters” will be showm. It’s called, “Gee Whiz” and it lives right up to, its calling. Rapid-fire flash and, action characterize what may be, termed a “humdinger.”, One of the always-amusing Literary, Digest reels of humorous sayings will, complete this attractive program., Tomorrow night we will see, Charles Ray in one of his best pic, tures, "The Busher.” You all re, member “The Pinch Hitter.” Well,, here’s another winner of the same, kind, with the same “Charlie” at the,, bat., The big dance every Saturday at, Eagle Hall., PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH DIREC, TORY, Sunday school at 10:45 a. m., Preaching service 12 m., Junior Christian Endeavor, 3 p. m., Evening service, 7:30 o’clock., Choir rehearsal Tuesday 8 p. m., Prayer meeting Thursday 8 p. m., J.

GAL1, ! IS OPTIMISTIC, ABOUT FUTURE, , -, y, James C. Galen, proprietor of the, Alaska Transfer Company, returned, on the Alameda from ‘an extended, trip to the slates, having spent con, siderable time in the new Montana, oil fields and visited as far east, as New York and Washington. When, seen yesterday by a Times represen, tative Mr. Galen said:, “Yes, I had a fine trip; glad I made, it, but at the same time—dike all, Alaskans—am just as glad to get, back. Seattle and the coast general, ly are very quiet but it is my opinion, that the worst is passed and that, the return to normal and better times, will be rapid. The lumbering busi, ness on the coast has already begun, to pick up again all over. In the, East I found a much beter feeling, relative to business and the future, generally—factories are gettag back, to full time everywhere, but this is, atributable to he fact that the East, was hit earlier., “As to Alaska, while I do not, look for a remarkable year, owing to, the curtailment in the fishing in, dustry, yet there will bo considerable, tourist travel, with many old-timers, returning., \'While oil exploitation will not ap, proach the peak until next year,, there will be considerable activity, seen this year, all of which should, result in a good time for Alaska gen, orally and this section in particular., 1 confidently look for Alaska to come, into her own in the very near future,, owing principally to the liberal policy, promised by the new administration, and the great activity in oil and coal, due lo the world-wide scarcity of the, first mentioned commodity., “Politics? Oh, yes, I know all, about those little things, particularly, as concerns Alaska! Seriously, 1, cannot see anything but Gearge C., Hazelet for governor. That this ap, pointrnent will be made very early 1, haven\'t the least doubt. Both sen, ators from the state of Washington., Senator Nelson from Minnesota and, others who have heretofore taken, u great interest in Alaskan affairs, generally and political appointments, in particular, are unanimous in ex, pressing themselves as well pleased, that we have finally gotten together, and elected a good representative, delegate by a handsome majority and, that we have elected a national com, mitteeman by popular vote also, thus, authoritatively designating a spokes, man for the Republican party in Ala -, ka. Under these circumstances it is, the sincere disposition of these sen, ators to interefere in Alaska patron, age no farther than to whole-hearted, ly stand by the recommendations, of our national committeeman with, reference to appointments and those, of our delegate in regard to neces, sary beneficial legislation for the, territory. This being true, l cannot, conceive how the appointment ot, Mr. Hazelet can possibly fail. After, this is brought about—-and I consider, it the paramount issue that all good, Alaskans who have the best inter, ests of the territory at heart should, be enthusiastically in accord with Mr., Hazelet as governor and as such the, personal representative of the ad, ministration in Alaska, Dan Suther, land as representative and oue who, knows the needs of each section in, the entire territory, and Jack Mc, Bride, our national committeeman, a, successful business man and old, timer, can ail get together and see, to it that we have good Alaskans, appointed to all the available posi, tions and that we get recognition, from congress in the matter of liberal, and constructive legislation which, will counteract the conservation crime, of 190S, thus giving the pioneer his, just proportion of the fruits of his, pioneering and labor and Alaska her, place in the sun.”, FISH BOAT RUNS INTO, PILING AND IS SUNK, While returning to Cordova from, a trip on the sound, Chris Xiros\' boat, rammed a submerged pile and went, to- the bottom. Xiros was about a, mile off shore when the accident, occurred. He hit the pile ond-ou and, as the speed of the boat carried him, past the pile swung outward tearing, half the bottom out of the boat., Xiros barely had time to grab a loaf, of bread and a blanket and jump, into the dingey. He had gotten about, ten feet from the boat when she went, down. •, Xiros rowed ashore and took refuge, in an abandoned fisherman’s cabin, until the next day when he signaled, a passing gas boat and was brought, [ into Cordova. The boat and contents, represented approximately $2,000., Special, Price, 75 PAIRS MEN’S, SHOES, of the best makes, such* as, Walkover, Howard & Foster, and Crosset Shoes, Your choice of these Shoes, at the Special Price of, $7.50, Finkelstein & Sapiro, INCORPORATED, Phone 21 Phone 74, I, STYLE IS BUiLT, INTO A STETSON, TO STAY, We have the new SPRING STETSON, HATS in various shapes and colors, to suit your taste.
