C. Batterman\n(a martinet and hero of a thousand\ndress parades\') he found over thirty\nprisoners carrying balls and chains\nabout half of whom were carrying\nonly chains, without balls attached.\nA chain is made of heavy iron\nlinks, about two feet long and rivu\ned to the ankles, and a ball ana\nchain adds an iron ball of about 30\npounds weight, fastened to a chain\nof about ten feet in length, which\nchain is rivited to the short chain.\nMr. Garrard also\' found "stocks"\nhanging and ready for use in the bi\ncell room. Stocks are pulleys and\nropes, such as are used in raising\nbales of hay into a barn, and were\nattached to the ceiling. At the low\ner end they had little steel wristlets,\nwhich they fastened on the wrists\nof the prisoner to be punished, anu\nraise him up until he would faint\nfrom the effects of the torture, and\nlower him to the floor and keep hm.\nthere until he recovered conscious\nness, and then raise him again, and\nthen put him in the dungeon ann\nfeed him on cornbread and water.\nA young man named Daniel Ma\nthenv, was thus fed for six months.\nMr. Garrard auso found "big shoes.\'\nA big shoe is a shoe loaded with j\nlead, weighing over 30 pounds, and\nthe suspected offender was made to\nwear the big shoe and walk up and ,\ndown the hot sandstone floor of the i\nprison yard until he fell from ex- j\nhaustion.

Then he had the big\nshoes sent to the blacksmith shop\nas junk, and more sunlight penetrat\ned. Then he investigated the cases .\nof all prisoners wearing ball and\nhad them taken off and sent to the\nblacksmith shop, and then immedia\ntely followed Christian-like looking\ncountenances in the place of murderous-looking\nfrowns, and thereaf\nter the prisoners looked solely to\nthe Hoard of Pardons for their free\ndom, and Mr. Garrard had no trou\nble with his wards, and no concen\ntrated effort to escape was ever\nmade or attempted to be made dur\ning his administration.\nTruly, as well stated by Lord\n\'Thomas Babbington Macaulay:\n"Familiarity with gastlv spectacles\ncreates hard-heartedness."\nThe reader will draw his or her\nown conclusions and moial from the\nforegoing statements of " facts, It\nfound to be true.\nLITTLE BOY\nLittle Frank Lopez, ivho has bei\nhaving more than his share of hard\nknocks for a youngster, is. suffering\nwith a broken arm.

NEVADA,\nThe Making of\nGood Americans\nAn interesting story of the mak\ning of good Americans out of illit\nerate foreigners was toM in a lec\nture at the University of California\nby C. W. nianpied, immigration\nsecretary of the San Francisco Y.\nM. C. A.\nWhile working in a factory. Blan\npied saw a foreman, angry at a for\neign worknians inability to under\nstand orders, hit the workman in the\njaw and knock him off a platform\nupon a pile of hicks, to nis grievous\ninjury. When Blanpied remon\nstrated, the foreman expressed great\nsuprise at his interest in a mere\n"wop." "If you want to help him\nout." said the foreman, "why don\'t\nyou teach him to talk English?"\nI\'.lanpied iti that instant saw a life\nwork dawn before him. He set to\nwork. Tie gathered together a\ngroup of Salvonians in a room a\nsaloon keeper put at hi disposal\n(after a church\') had refused simi\nlar accommodations\') and began to\nteach the men English. A friend,\na college student, went with him one\nnight to sec what he was doing, nnn\nwas fired with enthusiasm. Blan\npied turned over his Slavonians to\nthe student and Rot a thousand for\neigners studying English, and for\nteachers, sixty-four college students.\nThese foreigners are taught not\nonly English, but civics, hygiene,\ngood citizenship, better skill for\ntheir occupations., and fit notions as\nto how to become good Americans.\nAnd the college students were get\nting just as much good as the for\neigners, for they were learning\nabout human nature, about how to\ndeal with men, and acquiring the\nhabit of social service, the habit of\ntrying to make the world better\nthrough their own personal efTorts.\nSix weeks ago Blanpied came to\nSan Francisco to organize a similar\nwork there, in a great seaport eit\n72 per cent of whose inhabitants are\neither foreign-born or else the chil\ndren of foreign parents. Interest in\nsocial service work is taken nmo-g\nmany of the students of the Univer\nsity of California. Already a num\nber of them have joined with Blan\npied to aid in this great work of\nhelping the immigrant to become a\nvaluable member of an "American\ncommunity, a work particularly im\nportant for California now that the\nPanama canal is soon to pour floods\nof immigrants upon the Pacific\ncoast.\nNOVEMBER 25, 1912\n!
