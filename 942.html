The excitement was al- J, layed when it. was learned that the dis, ease was nothiug more than measles., Two soldiers, who were among those, en route to Fort Gibbon, were affected, by the malady., President Taft, when in Seattle, said, that he was still in favor of a govern- j, ment for Alaska by a 2ommission, par, tially appointive and the balance elec, tive. He also favored the \'easing of, i the Alaska coal lauds, claiming that, such a system would atti act cupital, and bring about the rapid develop, ment. of the Territory., The most artistic piece of native, carving ever turned out by the Eski, mos belougs to Robert R. Zehner, the, jeweler, says the Nome Nugget, it is, the well known piece of art depicting, the great Japanese motto, "Hear no, Evil, Speak no Evil, See no Evil." The, workmanship of this particular carving |, is so perfect many ate inclined to, doubt it is the work of an Eskimo., Ou tne morning of September 23rd ?, the tram car en route from Fiat. City, to lditarod City was held up by ten, masked men who ordered all on board, to hold up their -hands. The bandits, took possession of a strong box con, taining 833,000 in treasure aud ordered, the car to proceed. A hundred men, from Flat City turned out to scour the j, hills for the bandits. All the gold ex, ceptiug $182, belonging to the tram, company, was picked up near the, scene of the robbery. None of the, robbers was captured., Nome. ?

Iu the trial which follo*\\k5d,, the defense held that the place in, which the rneu were arrested is the, warm storage warehouse of Hall, and, not a gambling resort, and the jury j, apparently viewed the "matter in the, same light. All the men were found, not guilty., Bringing a tale of new islands off, the Alaskan coast, islands newly forged, in nature\'s workshop and thrust up, from the sea under the eyes of the, ship\'s compauy, Fred Schroeder, cap, tain of the schooner Elviera, steered, his vessel into Sau Francisco on Oct., 5, fresh from a sea otter huutiug cruise, in the Arctic. Schroeder said that as if, his vessel neared Bogoslav, an island, peak in Northern waters, a burst of 1, vapor rose above the island, sp. ashing i, the sky with bright colors. From the |, ascending cloud dust rained down i, upon the sea, stirring it to a toiling, mass, and as the vapor cleared, new <, laud was in sight. "Wrben it cooled i, off," said Schroeder, "there were four i, new islands. We could see tliem dis- i, tinctly,. but they quivered iu such a, strange way that -we did not attempt to i, approach them ", . 1. O\'Connor, Ulbolesale and Retail, Dealer in, i, f, wgetwiMN ?? ?, The Whitehorse Star says that fal, con Joslin is a "really live one.", Superintendent Ross Kinney, of the, Alaska road commission, who has been, engaged iu buildiug the Seward idita, rod trail, has returned to Seward,, briuging the report that the trail is all, ready for the snow ,*and that the trip, from Seward to the Iditarod may bo, made iu much better time than ever, bofoie. There are roadhour.es all the, way iu now, aud travelers will not be, obliged to camp out at any point., Nome. ? There seems to be good j, foundation in fact for the report that a j, consolidation is pending which will, affect the three principal mining con, cerns of the district ? the Wild Goose, company, the Pioneer Mining company, and the Consolidated Dredging com, pany. Otlicials of the companies re, fuse to make statements, but not any, of them deuy the rumors outright., Prior to the consolidation, the Pioneer, Mining company will distribute in the;, neighborhood of $250,000 in dividends., The greater part of die stock of this i, company is held by Alaakaus aud for, mer Alaakaus who are now in the, States., "in 1863, ni )ety per cent of the na, tive population of the West coasi of, Vancouver inland aud Southeast:, Alaska, and a? far west as Yakutat, !, were decimated by the ravages of small, pov," syys Dr. S. Hall Young, the vet, eran Alaska missionary, iu the Iditarod, Pioneer. "Whole villages were wiped, out of existence, only the decaying, totem poles aud crumbling buildings, and huts were left to tell the tale of, the awful scourge.7\' In 1878, when Dr., Young came to the Southeastern Alaska, coast, nearly all the native men were, pock-marked. The few white men., scattered along the coa^t, when the j, plague came, fled iuto the wilderness, aud sustained themselves by hunting,, in order to escape the pestilence., Uifford Pinchot, according to a, statement received iu Washington, from. his press agent, who accompanies, him, believes Secretary of the Interior ;, Fisher permitted himself to be misled ,, by Alaska Syndicate agents during his |, recent trip to the North, and because I, of Mr. Fisher\'s recent expressions, repudiating the Piuehot idea, a con, troversy more bitter eveu thau the, Kallinger-Pincbot conflict will take, place at Washington this wiuter. The, statement reads, in part, as follows: I, "It is now evident that word has been, passed along the line to all representa, tives of the Alaska Syndicate and of, the Federal administration to \'knock\', Alaska generally, to bear the value of ,, the coal, copper, timber, everything., Men who a few months ago were expia, ting eloquently on the riches and pos, sibilities of Alaska, have suddenly be, gun to discover that there is nothing of, of value here. Ordinary facts of com, monest knowledge to all Alaska are, distorted with thia purpose. The 1, nation is well understood in Alaska,, ? i, and it is so serious that it is realized, the whole Alaska controversy is about, to be precipitated in a form that may, outrival the bitterness of the 3alliu- j, Kev-Piueihot fight*", Wo have heard of the man who rob, bed his ritfht pocket with his left hand, butChifina has him beat a city block, when it comes to a 9tingy man, says, the Leader. This man is very fond of, -good whisky if someone else psys for, it, but every Chrfttmas he treats him, self to a two gallon jug of the cheap, article. Being also lonely he has ac, quired the habit of talking to him<elf.., Every Sunday morning he bakes a, batch of bread that must last him the?, rest of the week, and along about Sun, day morning the bread gets pre-ty, stale but he b \'ibes himself to eat iu, Some neighbors passiug by his cabin, recently, heard him mumbliug to him-*, self, and knowing his pec lliarities, i watched him through the open door, and vouch for the following: Sitting:, at the table with nothing but stale*, bread he drew forth the treasured j\'i?, which he bought last Christmas, and, pouring a brimming cup said to him, self: "Now old boy, if you will eat, this bread you may theu driuk this, whisky. All light partner, l\'il d ) It.**, He then set to work and filled himself, full of the dry bread; then carefully, taking the cup, smelied of the bjver-., a?e, but shaking his head addressed, the drink, saying, "you are good alt, right but cost too much money.**, Thereupon he poured the whisky bacif, into the jug, thus bribiug himseif an i, then beating himself out of the bribe^, "All aboard for the Fiat City, Special!" was the announcement mide,, at Iditarod, the last frontier camp o?, Alaska, a few days ago. It marked the*, completion of construction of the>, Farthest North railroad iu America,,, and the inauguration of passenger aui, freight service. The Flat City Special, runs from Iditarod to Flat\' creek,, distance of seven miles. Located at a, place so inaccessible that the owners, have no fear of that baue of railroad, magnates iu the United States, the in%, ferstate commerce commUaiou, a fare?, of 83 one way and $5 for a round trip, is charged. The auriferous placer, mines will be worked out aud the rail*, road abandoned, it is believed, before*, the department officials will get there^, tape unwound and make a visit to tht*, place. The railroad is not an elaborv %, ate affair, nor are the cars furnished iu, the ornate manner that distinguishes!, the railroads operating between Seattle, aud poiuts to the Eaat aud South. Iu, fact, one might say, the Northern railt, road is slightly primitive. It ia con., structed of wooden rails, laid ou ties, made of spruce logs, aud the cars arc*, opeu trucks made from the same kiu(J, of lumber with steel wheels, especially, imported from a Seattle foundry. Th$, locomotive is 17 mule power. Its in, auguration followed the driving of a, golden spike by Fred Wilson, one of, the owners, and a jovial celebration ou, the part of the spectators. Meals are, not served en route, except to tha, hardy animals which form the looorno\'., tive. The passengers content them, selves with a lunch takea iu their, pockets. The traiu makes the trip iq, less than two hours.

HOPP, editor and Proprietor., Wednesday, October 13, 1911., \'PHONE NO. J 2., Gone on Before., A few days ago the press dispatches, annouueed that Gov. Walter E. Clark,, of Alaska, bad go ue down to Portland,, Ore., to visit the institution which has, the con tr act for the care of the Alaska !, insane. Certain reports have circa, lated and, no doubt, ere this have, reached official ears, that ?ome of the, practices engaged in at this institu, tion are of the mo-t inhuman kind. ?, Calculated to plunge the poor in- f ,, mates into still deeper darkness ,, rather than to effect a healing of tbeir ,, malady. ,, The lonesome darkness of the North,,, the excitement of the stampede, the, cold, the icy trail, the privations of the, pioneer, all combine to unseat the, mind, and many each year complete a \', a life of energy by losing their hold \', upon their mental lever. A> a Dawson 1, nigger on his way South once said: \', "This heai all night climate aud home, made \'hootch\' makes \'em crazy; I feels, kinder queer sometimes myself aud, l\'s guinter git oaten hear \'for it strikes \', me.", Alaskan?- will unite in the hope that, the investigation will be most thorough,, and should it reveal a single ground, Tor the charges made, that justice will, be measured out to the guilty ones,, sure aud swift., The insane of Alaska are cared for at \', Mount Tabor, Portland, Ore., under a 1, contract made April 28. 1909, at the 1, rate of $330 per auuum per capita. In, bis annual jeport for 1910, Governor, Clark say* that, in his opiuion, this ar, raugeuicut is much more satisfactory |, than the p!a:i proposed of construct, iug au a?ylum in Alaska for the care, of insane, aud their treatment is much j, more likely to be successful in a cli ^, mate milder in wiuter than the interior ], of Alaska, and less cloudy and rainy, than the Alaska coast., The people of Alaska may perhaps ,, be called rough, tut it is very seldom, t hat they allow those who are unfortu ,, nate or afflicted to suffer for the want ,, of such help as money can give them., Every cump has its little charities of (, this kiud constantly under way. The, incorporated towns also do their part., During the pa- 1 year tht? town of Doug, las spent more thau a thousand dollars j, for the help of iudigeat persous. This ,, may not seem much to cities like, Seattle and Tacoma, but it is no small ,, part of the revenues of a. town like (, Douglas. (, Tb* oo)y case in which the Federal ;, government helps bear the burdens of, A las isa, outs id 3 of the punishment of ,, crime, is in the care of the insaue, and, we cau expect no less than that our, governor shall see that this is done, carefully and well; aud that the poor, unfortunates who are taken to Mount, Tabor shall not be mistreated., The two show compauies that went, down t he Yukon as far as Fairbanks,, are back in Southeastern Alaska on, their way to tb9 States. The May i, Roberts company is showing in .Juneau, this week, and promise to hit Douglas, about Sunday night. *fhe Sherman, Cleveland Musical Comedy Co.,. with, the dancing girls, is at Skagway this, week for three nights., Albin Baritello, Mark Smith, James, Daniels, John Richards, Dan Popovich, and Otto Wilde, who have beeu hunt, ing at Pybus bay for the past two, weeks, returned last evening. They |, encountered some rough weather that, ?aade traveling risky even in so safe aj, boat as the City of Rome. However,, they found ducks and geese plentiful,, and with now and then a bit of veui, son they lived high., Oar old townsman, Andy Johnson, |, has decided to stay with us. He has, bought back from Mr. L. S. Ferris a, half interest in the Douglas Steam, Laundry and will remain a9 manager, of the institution. The boys will make, extensive improvements to the build, ing and machinery, until the plant is 1, second to none in Alaska. Mr. E. JL.

The, next pay day will not be till November, IGtb., Assistant Superintendent Kennedy\'s, house is being raised about four feet, and several other alterations are being, made to it., Owing to so many officers of the fire, department being out of town the fire, meeting to have been held ou Wednes, day night was postponed until October, 2oth., The large bed plates for the new 700 ?, hoist have been taken np the bill into, the concrete house prepared for them, and the balance of the machinery will, soon follow and be also placed in posi, tion., 4, At a- band meeting held last week, Roy Norliu was elected vice president,, in place of W. Casey, resigned, and, John Gillam elected secretary in place, of Charles Swibart, resigned. Several, matters of importance were disposed, of. :, l, E. A.

(, Phis is the first steamer of the United, Oil company to make this port, as the, bou tract of the Tread well company ,, with the Associated Oil compauy has j, expired and a uew contract made with j, the United company. Tho boat is 395, feet long and is ten feet longer than |, the Porter. She formerly was an army J, trausport. She will arrive back in this ], port in about twelve days with auother j, cargo., The show at the Club on Saturday I, iight was largely attended desp ite the ?, Sad weather. The uiauager was disap, pointed at the last minute by the nou- j, ir rival of three people who were to ;, aelp make fun for the eveniug, and he, >vas forced to go ou hinrn-lf aud give a, monologue, which convulsed the au ,, iience with laughter. The illustrated, >ong was sung by Max Pitzmau, and, was received with much applause. The, pictures were about the best ever, shown iu the Club. Tho coucert this, week will consist of four pieces, by the band, an illustrated song aud, three reels of pictures*, i, The swimming races at the Club on, Monday uight were very good. The, first race was between Bell and Thomas, ind was veYy exciting, being won by, Bell by about six \\ inches. The second, >peed race was won by J. Gillam. The ;, egg aud spoon race by Jack Wilson (of, checker fame),, tho fancy diving by, Stephens, Lindsay and Jacobson was i, loudly applauded. The tub race was a, disappointment, as the tubs were too\', small. The affair wound up with a, polo match between teams captained, by Thomas and Wilson. Whilo neither j, team scored a goal still there were!, some very close calls on goal, and the, matoh was declared a draw. The, game will soon become very popular, uud, no doubt, the ladies will soon be, taking it up as a pastime on Friday ,, nights., There will be the usual services at, tho Congregational church next Suu- !, day.
