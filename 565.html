The map covers a district\ntwelve miles square and is one of th*\nhistorical places of interest in the State.\nIt was the scene 45 years ago of one of\nthe greatest mining excitements ever\nwitnessed in the West, which is still\nknown to this day as the White Pine\nexcitement. At the time the map was\nmade, 35,000 people were in the three\ntowns embraced on it, Hamilton, Treas\nure City and Sherman Town, and th*\nhills between were dotted with the cab\nins and tents of prospectors. There\nwere 88,000 recorded mining locations,\nand Recorder Teddy cleared $44,00C\nfrom his fees. At one time he bad seven\ndeputies, one of whom was afterward!\nJudge 8abine. There were 800 mining\nincorporations formed to work on\nTreasure Hill. Fine business block!\nwere built, banks started up and for a\nfew years the spot was the cynosure of\nthe eyes of all who were adventurous.\nThe Eberhardt mine produced over ten\nmillions of dollars within 180 feet of\nthe surface and pinched out. The or*\nwas of fabulous richness, one ton net\nting $88,000. The Aurora mine pro\nduced several millions, and there was\nconsiderable wealth taken out from\nother mines. Finally when the Eber\nhardt gave ont there was an exodus\nfrom the plaoe as rapid as its upbuild\ning- ___\nRapid Tonopah Collections.\nA few days ago a Tonopah restaur\nant keeper, who owed several bills, left\nhis plaoe of business to go down town\nto purchase some beef, and during his\nabeenoe creditors entered the establish\nment and carried away everything in\nsight, even to the stove on which part\nof the dinner was oooking.—Enterprise.\nChance for Nevada Exportations.\nThe Livestock Growers’ Association\nof Yolo Oounty, CaL, will pay $5, and\nthe Board of Supervisors of the same\ncounty an additional $5, for the scalp of\nevery ooyote killed in that oounty after\nthe 5th of October. 1903.\nRailway Qompany.\nOn and After July 1,1903,\nTRAINS\nFor Fallen?*™, Malls, Ex\npress and Freirht,\nWILL RDM DilLT EICEPT SDRDAT,\n(Pacific Standard Tima),\nAS FOLLOW* I\nLeAve Eureka at..12:40 P.

Nevada.\nSENATOR JONES IMPLICATED.\nRival Magnates Mixed Up in a Mexi\ncan Mining Fend.\nA bitter war baa been inaugurated\nbetween rival millionaires in a ten-mil\nlion Mexican mining deal. A number\nof men of National note are mixed np\nin the fend, including United States\nSenators Jones, Call and Butler and\nAdmiral Schley, says a New York press\ndispatch of October 12.\nHostilities began in Washington last\nweek, when James V. Dignowitz, the\nmining king of Arroyo fame, caused\nthe desk of Secretary Norris of the\nMexican Miuing aud Exploration Com\npany to be forced aud papers and books\nto be seized. In retaliation Engene\nDavis, a millionaire banker of Washing\nton, had Dignowitz arrested for brealT\ning and entering. He was relased on\nbail and went to New York, where he\nwas again arrested on Monday on a\ncharge of having slandered Mr. Davis\nthrough publicly charging him with\nhaving embezzled 9100,000 of the com\npany\'s funds. The complaiut was sup\nported with affidavits from Senator\nJohn P. Jones of Nevada and others.\nMr. Dignowitz says: "This whole af\nfair grows out of an attempt on the part\nof a minority in the Mexican Mining\nand Exploration Company to suppress\nthe aocounta and prevent the majority\nfrom learning the exact condition of\naffairs. It is charged that I accused\nMr. Davis to President Jones of having\nembezzled $100,000 of the funds. Of\nthat I have nothing to say at the pre\nsent time, but I will have my say in\nCourt.”\nGENERAL NEWS SUMMARY.\nThe Salt Trust, whose paper capital\nwas $13,000,000 announces its assets at\n937,000.\nThe Western Federation of Miners\nhas issued a circular requesting men\nnot to go to the Cripple Creek district.\nInvestigation into the affairs of the\nshipbuilding trusts show that the pro\nmoters acted as birds of prey and\nthrough insatiate demands caused col\nlapse.\nJacob and Herman Eppiuger and B.\nEtlinger have been expelled from memb\nership in the Merchants’ Exchange of\nSan Francisco, for reason of alleged\nfrauds recently investigated by the\nGrand Jury.\nThe clerk of the Kansas City, Kansas,\nBoard of Education admits that he re\nceived money from insurance agents\nwho insured the public schools. Teach\ners also have complained that they\nwere “held up” for various sums to re\ntain their positions, and a Grand Jury\ninvestigation is promised.\nHow to Become Independent.\nA settler who takes up laud along the\nline of the irrigation canal and has\nhorses can get employment iu excavat\ning it for himself and teams and, if\nthrifty, will have enough money when\nthe work is completed to clear his eighty\nacre* of sage brush, fence it iu part and\nseed it to grain, hay or vegetables, with\na certainty that he will always have an\nample supply of water for irrigation.—\nVirginia Report.\n.\n• ———————\nNye Sheriff’s New Bondsmen.\nTonopah Bonanza: Sheriff Cushing\nhas furnished a new bond with Milo\nT.

As Radium is a by pro\nduct of Uranium Ithere is a fortune in\nsight for the prospector lucky enough\nto secure enough for one pound of the\nformer rare metal.\nCHAINMAN FINANCIAL AFFAIRS.\nMethods Being Used in the East to\nRaise Money for Debts.\nWhite Tin* New*, October 15.\nThe following is takeu from the\nWellsville, N. Y„ Daily Importer, and\nillustrates the general feeling prevail\ning amoug the holders of Chainman\nstock in the East, a feeling which was\noriginally due to the extravagant and\nincompetent mine and business man\nagement of the company, together with\nthe exaggerated and corrupt methods\nresorted to by the promoters in finan\ncing the company, and the subsequent\nfailure of the mine and mill to pay un\nder their management, who after feath\nering their own nests, left an accumul\nation of debts for the innocent share\nholders to pay :\n■■noiders or tne mucn exploited\nChainman mining stock had the pleas\nure last evening of hearing another\nchapter in the exciting story of this\nmine from Messrs. C. S. Lattin of El\nmira, secretary of the company, and H.\n0. Mandeville an attorney of the same\ncity. The Chainman miue, which is\nlocated at Ely, Nevada, has had its ups\nand downs ; mostly downs, aud yet\nthere was enough loose mouey lying\naronnd Wellsville to absorb something\nover 150,000 worth of this stock, most\nof the investors thinking they had\nstruck a bonanza in tbeir purchase of\nsame. Chainman stock sold all the way\nfrom 50 cents to fl.50 a share. To-day\ncarloads of it can be bought for most\nany old price, if one should want to\npurchase. Notwithstanding that hun\ndreds of thousands of dollars had been\npoured into this company for the pur\npose of developing the mine, to-day\nthere is said to be 150,000 of indebted\nness hanging over the plant, and the\nofficers are visiting the various com\nmunities where suckers are most prom\ninent, to induce the stockholders to\nstand for an assessment of approximate\nly 10 per cent iu order to make good the\ndeficiency. The meeting called here\nWednesday evening was for the same\npurpose, as Wellsville was down on the\nmap as being the proud possessor of\nsome 87,000 shares of this most valuable\nstock, and the fortunate investors as\nsembled last evening to hear the glow\ning reports of this great mine and inci\ndentally be touched up for auother 10\nper cent tax.”\nIu the face of the above uufavorable\naccount of the Chainman, we venture\nthe assertion that should the officers of\nthe company succeed iu raising enough\nmoney to liquidate the present debts\naud retain a surplus of a tew thousand\nfor legitimate development work, the\nmiue will yet pull itself out of the hole,\nbut the company should be very care\nful to see that the management, of the\nproperty is placed iu the hands of good,\npractical and experienced western min\niug men; men who are familiar with the\nconditions of the mine, the characteris\ntics aud peculiarities of ores and the\nproper method of saving their values.\nOtherwise another failure will result.\nA Business Proposition.\nSpeaking of the new Irrigation Law,\nSecretary of the Interior Hitchcock\nsays: “The plau is for the Govern\nment to develop the water supply,\nwhich will be rented to landholders.\nWhen the system of watering is com\npleted, the improvements will be sold\nto the landholders according to the cost.\nThe money appropriated for the work\nwill thus be turned over and over. As\nsoon as one district is provided with ir\nrigation facilities, the money realized\nfrom the sale of water rights will be\nused in improving another district.\nHow Haworth Ruus Stage Lines.\nEly Mining Review: Superintendent\nW. S. Haworth of theJEly-Eureka stage\nline spent a few days in Ely during the\npast week making contracts for hay for\nthe animals on his route. The practice\nof putting green goggles on mail route\nhorses, which has long been iu vogue in\nWhite Pine County, is evidently not re\ngarded with favor by Mr. Haworth.\nHis horses will be "up against the real\nthing" in the hay line this Winter\nwhen they look into their mangers,\nand it is even hinted there will be an\noccasional oat in the feed-box.\nWalker River Cattle Prices.\nThe Reno Gazette of October 16 says:\nJ. L. Blackburn, the cattle man, was\nan arrival from Walker river and Mason\nValley last night. Mr. Blackburn sold\nhis cattle interests in the south during\nAugust. At that time range stock in\ngood condition brought #34 per head.\nSince that timo the price has dropped\nuntil now they are only bringing #15\nper head. The latest sale in that coun\ntry was by Rogers to Spriugmeyer for\nthe above price.\nGives Birth to Triplets.\nSaturday morning Mrs Henry Bern\ning of Gardnerville, Nevada, gave birth\nto three daughters, each of them weigh\ning seven pounds. Mrs. Beruing was\nformerly Miss Olive Biglow of Oarsoa.\nTHE ROCCO-HOMESTAKE.\nCompany Has 810,000 in Treasury\nand Much Ore in the Mines.\nSalt Lake Tribune, October 18.\nA letter from Bert L. Smith of the\nthe Rocco-Homestake Mining Company\nto a local interest presents the proposi\ntion at Eureka, Nev., in most excellent\ncondition. At this time, writes Mr.\nSmith, who is directing the manage\nment, the company has no less than\n$10,000 in its stocking, and a dividend\nof some denomination will be paid as\nsoon as the mauagemeut ascertains what\nmoneys are required for the prosecution\nof work throughout the Winter. He is\nat present forwarding high-grade lead\nore, carryiug some silver, to the smelt\ners, while the new shaft, 4w feet north\nof that long in nse, is being equipped\nwith a hoister, and will, ou its connec\ntion with ore bodies that await it below,\nbe made the main outlet. In this way\nthe cost of extraction, says Mr. Smith,\nwill be materially reduced and the\nearnings correspondingly increased next\nseason. Mr. Smith voluuteers the as\nsurance that the management is losing\nno sleep over the futnre of Rocco-Home\nstake, a large portion of whose earnings\nhave come to Zion, while the physical\ncondition of the mine was never as\ngood as it is to-day.\nNEVADA PRESS COMMENT.\nTonopah Bonanza.\nThe Superintendent of Schools of\nLauder County is advertising for a\nteacher for a small Bchool near Austin,\naud he offers for her services the muni\nficent remuneration of $40 a month. In\naddition to her ability as a\' teacher she\nmust be able to give instruction in mu\nsic. Evidently that school superintend\nent is from Kansas, where teachers re\nceive only a trifle more than their\nboard.\nKly Mining Review.\nAlf Chartz, the sage of the western\npart of this "battle-born” State, wants\nto make a political issue of "equal taxa\ntion” iu Nevada. It cau not be done,\ndear boy. It requires a positive and a\nnegative side to make an issue, and\nevery dodgasted party iu the State\nwould insist upon lining up on the same\nside of the tax question—while a cam\npaign is iu progress. After that they\nwould all be on the other side.\nConfessions of a Priest.\nRev. Jno. S. Cox, of Wake, Ark., writes,\n“For 12 years I suffered from Yellow Jaun\ndice. I consulted a number of physicians and\ntried all sorts of medicines but got no relief.\nThen I began the use of Electric Bitters and\nfeel that I am now cuied of a disease that\nhad me in its grasp for twelve years.” If you\nwant a reliable medicine for Liver and\nKidney trouble, stomach disorder or general\ndebility, get Electric Bitters.

It means that they are deprived\nof a part of entry into thg rich Klon\ndike region and other gold fields of the\nnorth, and the feeling (ft irritation in\nBritish Columbia is especially intense.\nIn Vancouver there is l^oud complaint\non the part of the merchants there who\nhave large interests in thje territory and\nwho declare that ‘hey n\\> ^placed the\nmercy of t+ United State3.

She has deeded a\n110,000 brick honse in Kansas City,\nKansas, for the purpose of founding a\nhome for drunkards’ wives, widows and\norphans, and is going on the stage for\nthe purpose of raising money to found\nothers.\nThere is an old saying that “a sucker\nis born every minute, ” and one might\nreadily believe the truth of it by a\nglance at the array of get-rich-quick\nschemes that are being floated in this\ncountry.

Rumble, President, Secretary and\nTreasurer of the Sunset Mining Com\npany, was arrested last Tuesday in Sau\nFrancisco, in thq. office of the company\nin the Chronicle building. The charge\nagainst him was that of using the Uni*\nted States mails for the purpose of prac\nticing frand.\nRumble was exposed as a fraud in\n1902, shortly after his company made\nits appearance. The attack on his\nmethods at that time pnt the postal\nauthorities on his tiail, and for three\nyears they have been seeking evidence\nagainst him. The people who were so\nfinely fleeced would not swear to a war\nrant. Finally two persons were found\nwho were willing their names should\nbe used in a complaint.\nThe circulars which Rumble sent\nabroad through the mails contained\npictures of \' prosperous mines\nnear Oroville, California, working at\nfull blast, yielding tons of sand teeming\nwith gold. He advertised that the\ncompany had 10,000,Out) shares of stock,\nhaving a par value of $1 per share. He\npromised to pay 2 per cent a mouth\nin dividends on all investments. The\nget-rich-quick San^t stock was an easy\nbait, and Ramble has swindled people\nin nearly every State.\nFor the accommodation of those who\nwere looking for a sore thing mining\nproperty, and who called upon Ramble\nin San Francisco, were shown large\nnugget *, which he Suavely told prospec\ntive customers ‘‘were dug out of onr\nmines.” And if his "bird in hand”\nwent perchance to look at the mines,\nRumble would have the sluice boxes\nsalted with gold. *\nThe postal authorities believe they\nhave a strong case against Ramble.\n_•_0_\nNO EVIDENCE OF MURDER.\nCharles Calvin Did Not Die of\nStrychnine Poisoning.\nCharles Calvin did not die of strych\nnine poisoning on the 9th of last Jnly,\nat Hobart Mills, near Carson.

Bartine of Carson\nCity, who was reoently appointed spe\ncial Tax Examiner\'by the State Board\nof Revenue, was present and addressed\nthe Commissioners in reference to the\nredaction of taxes in Eureka County\nfor the ensuing year.\nMr. Bartine, in his preamble, said he\ncame particularly to bring about a a in*\nterchange of views, and bis principal\nbusiness was to get in touch with the ,\nvarious county officials to secure the\neasy working of the new Tax Redaction\nLaw, approved in March 1903. It bad\nnot been deemed feasible to pnt the\nnew law into effect this year, as tax\nrates hod been fixed prior to the approval\nof the Tax Redaction law, though the\nState Board of Revenue was anxious to\nhave the law effective throughout the\nvarious couuties in the State in 1904,\nCon tinning, Mr. Bart.ne said, in part:\nIn the eastern portion of Nevada the\nquestion had been agitated and there\nwas a strong sentiment favoring a\ngraduated tax redaction, a salient fea\nture of the new law, which provides\nthat a uniform rate of 10c on each $100\nbe deducted each year until a total re\ndaction of $1 ou the hundred had been\nreached. Thereafter, it was outlined as\nthe general policy, to effect a further\nreduction of 5c on the $100 until 50c\nhad been leached, designated a mini\nmum tax limit, which would give am\nple time for comities to adjust them\nselves to the new law. Very few rev\nenue laws stand for 30 years without\namendment. S\' me difficulty might be\nexperienced in bringing all conuties\naround to the new rate next year, but\nno apprehension was felt in regard to\nWashoe, Humboldt, Elko aud one or\ntwo others visited. It might, however,\nbo necessary to make amendmentf to\nthe law to suit local conditions. Es\nmeralda would have no difficulty in\nreaching a satisfactory basis. If there is\nincrease in wealth of couuties, the in\ncrease in values would offset the de\ncrease in rate ; if a decrease, counties\nwould have to raise valuations. To il\nlustrate, a couuty payiug a rate of $2.50\nou $100 assessed valuation in 1903, next\nyear under the new law the rate would\nbe only $2.40. The assessors would\ntherefore have to raise valuations to se\ncure the same amount of revenue, the\nonly difference to the taxpayer being\nthat his property stood ou the roll at\n$1025 instead of $1000.\nTo Eastern capital, the present rate\nwas appalling and had the effect of\ndriving away investments, where the\ntax rate stood at three or four per cent.\nReductions would obviate this.\nSystems prevailed, causing a scramble\nof taxpayers for reductions with the re\nsult that the aggregate of assessable\nproperty in Nevada was returned at a\ntrifle over #29,000,000 where it s.iould\nbe nearly #100,000,000, and it would be\nbetter to hav£ the higher assessment,\nwhich would give every man’s property\na better status. This was the idea of\nthe Board of Revenue, aud he,was pres\nent to invite the co-operation of Eureka\nCouuty. If the raise was general, as\ndesigned, uo cause of complaint by tax\npayers existed. So much had to be\nraised, though the conditions did vary.\nIu Nye County a nebulous sitnation\nexisted, aud though criminal prosecu\ntions had iuvohred them in heavy ex\npenses, he was satisfied the law would\nbe complied with, both iu Nye aud\nLauder County, thougi their floatiug\nindebtedness, payment of which was\nprovided by law, would possibly be\ncontested in some cases. Iu Lander,\nthe consensus of opiuion was that the\nfloating indebtedness would be taken\nup by a new issue of bonds. In Eureka\nit was a simple question of lower tax\nrate and higher valuations, a view the\nspeaker was convinced that presented\nuo complexities not snrmonn table. The\nStato Assessment Law provides for fix\ning rates on certain property by the\nState Board of Assessors. Individual\nassessments under the law would bo\nleft to local officials. Railroad lauds,\ntelegraph aud telephone property valu\nations would be raised by State B ard\nof Assessors or State enactment. Rail\nroad land assessments suonld be raised,\naud rate reduced 10c, making revenue\nto the county about the same as at\npresent. Prior to creation of the State\nBoard of Assessors, assessments on rail\nroads was fixed at #11,400 per mile. Tue\nfirst year thereafter the Board raised\nthe rate to #20,000 per mile. Judge\nHawley decided the law was invalid,\nand a compromise was effected on a\nbasis of $15,000 a mile. Now, under the\namended law, it is no longer necessary\nto classify property. Last year a classi\nfication was made, but it was unneces\nsary. Classification was not a fair way\nof getting values. However, the law\nnow gives the State B ard of Assessors\ncontrol. The State Board of Revenue\nwas axions both laws should be given a\nfair trial. There was no law so difficult\nas that of securing just taxation. The\nmore property a man had, the more op\nportunities there seemed for getting\nlower rates. Personal property was\neasily concealed. There was approx\nimately $2,000,000 actual cash or $50\nper head in the State, whereas taxes\nwere paid on abont $200,000, while\ninvestments were in many instances\nalso concealed. At this point, Mr. Bar\ntine expressed himself as being here to\nobtain as well os to impart information,\nas agent of the Board of Reveuue, to\nthe end that he wonld be able to make\nan intelligent report to them.\nMr. Fraser asked abont raising assess\nments in Enreka County.\nMr. Hooper was of the opinion it\nwonld be attended with some difficulty.\nMr. Fraser suggested that assess-,\nmeats should be made at actual tax\nvalue. In Eureka, the school funds\nwould have to be curtailed or valuations\nraised.\nMr. Bartine said the railroads would\nstand the slight increase in assessments :\nif the tax was reduced.\nMr. Hooper said the railroad cot Id\ncome in and make affidavit that roads\ncould be duplicated at $16,000 per mile,\nbut Mr. Bartine was of opinion this\nportion could not be maintained in the\ncourts. The Supreme Court would take\nconsideration of the purposes of the\nnew law, were an appeal brought be\nfore them, and if valuations were raised\nby assessors and tax rates reduced, such\nincrease of assessment could not be\nlowered by appeal to the courts. The\nlaw was based on the theory that prop\nerty was undervalued, which was self\nevident.\nMr. Fraser said the railroad assess\nment in Eureka county had been in\ncreased about $40,000, while other prop\nerty assessments decreased $10,000 to\n$15,000 per year the past eight years,\nwhich amounted to abont 50 per cent of\nassessed values prior thereto. If these\nassessments could not be raised, tax re\nduction would be difficult. The annual\ncounty revenues amounted to $16,000 or\n$17 ,000, from which the county was\npaying abont 33^3 percent to indigeuts\nand 50 per cent to schools.\nMr. Bartiue replied that the law\nwould be slow in operation and a start\nwas practical. For the present all that\nwas necessary was to make a 10-cent\nret action next year.\nMr. Fraser thought it a feasible idea\nto raise valuations all over the State,\naud County Boards of Equalization\nshould have power to make a horizontal\nraise.\nMr. Bartine concurred, but consid\nered the raise should be uniform.\nMr. Fraser thought the new law\nmight be carried into effoct next year.\nThis county had been paying a high State\nrate many years, yet the State Board\nhad raised the county’s apportionment\n20 per cent.\nMr. Bartine—County Assessors should\ntake into consideration the small raise\nin valuations necessary, which he es\ntimated at 2 or 3 per cent.\nMr. Fraser figured the increase neces\nsary on a loss to the county through the\n10c reduction, on a total assessed valu\nation of #1,800,000, would mean a raise\nof 8 or 9 per Cunt on assessable property\nto reimburse the county for the entailed\nloss of #1600 or #1700 which the opera\ntion of the new law would effect.\nMr. Bartine figured the increased as\nsessment at #145,000, to produce the re\nquired revenue, which, in the case of\nthe railroad would mean a raise of #1350\nper mile, and the only thing to do was\nto make the raise effective.\nMr. Fraser said ,the County Commis\nsioners were compelled by law to make\ntheir budget this year for the ensuing\nyear, and they could incur no expense\nthe budget did not provide for.\nMr. Bartine replied that the idea was\nto make expenses come within the rev\nenue pursuaut to State law.\nMr. Fraser, replying said Eareka\nCounty had no bonded debt, or debt or\nany kind, and didn’t want any.\nMr. Hooper remarked that if the big\ncounties would come up, there would be\nno trouble with the smaller ones.\nMr. Bartine—It would be necessary\nfor taxpayers to take the situation phil\nosophically; to nnderstaud that while\nthe assessed valuation would be in\ncreased, the tax rate would be corres\npondingly decreased.\nMr. Fraser thought many counties\ncould stand the raise, while it might be\na hardship on counties like Eureka, uud\nwas of opinion the counties should be\nclassified.\nMr. Bartiue thought there was a good\ndeal of force in the suggestion, and ex\npressed himself as glad to have met the\nBoard and to reach an understanding\nof the situation in Eureka Couuty.\nMr. Fraser said the agitation had done\nconsiderable good and had raised values\n#5,000,000 or #6,000,000.\nMr Baruue did not consider the rail\nroad would object to an increased as\nsessment if other property was raised\ncorrespondingly, aud he was convinced\nEureka County would not stand out if\nthe same uniform action could be se\ncured from the other counties through\nout the State.\nAfter some further desultory discus\nsion of various topics, the Board ad\njourned.\nCATTLE LOW, HAY HIGH.\nThe Carson Appeal of October 31\nsays: The people of the United States\nin nearly every section, from the\nhead of the river to the valleys below,\nare holding on to their hay this\nFall with a vengeance. Up Carson Val\nley there is little hay to sell, as the buy\ners and stockmen have secured most of\nit for feeding this Winter. Some stoc\nhas already been driven in to take np\nthe Winter feed. Pasturage is still\ngood bat some hay is beiug fed. Along\nwith the high rate of hay the cattle\nprices are extremely low.\nLast week a band of #250 head of\nsteers were sold at the rate of #15 per\nhead and a number of calves went with\nthe bunch. Another lot sold for #18\nand they were in first class order. The\nreason of the low price of cattle is the\nshortage of bay crops in other sections.\nIn a number of places in California the\nhay crop is a failure, and in fact, in\n\'sections of Nevada, a short crop has\nbeen cut, which leaves the stock man\nwith more cattle than hay and a gen\neral unloading is taking place. Cattle\nare lower at this time than for the past\nthree years, and it is believed that the\nprices wili be down for the entire season.\nOcean Steamer Crashes on a Reef.\nThe steamer South Portland, carry\ning 16 lossengers and a crew of 34 of\nficers and seamen, struck on the Cape\nBlanco reef, on the southern coast of\nOregon, on October 19. Captain J. B.\nMcIntyre, who was in command, lost\nhiB course in a dense fog that obscured\nall the region. Twenty-ono persons are\nmissiug. The South Portlaud was ou\nher way to Sau Francisco from Portland,\nOregon. She was considered an unsea\nworthy craft by sailors, and some re\nfused to ship with her on her last voy\nage from Sau Francisco.\nRESOLUTIONS OF RESPECT.\nAdopted by Alpha Lodge No. 1, A. 0.\nU.

Nevada.', 'THE ALASKAN DECISION.\nCanadian pessimism as to the result\nof the hearing on the Alaskan boundary\nclaims was fully justified by the award\nmade. Canada’s chief purpose in rais\ning the contention which resulted in\nthe appointment of the commission\nwhich has just wm pie ted its work, was\nto obtain a port of egress on the ocean\nfrom Daw son; her claim was of Dyea,\nor Skagwny or any other place at the\nhead of an inlet or a bay, to which ac\noeaa could be had without passing\nthrough United States territory. In\nthis she has wholly failed. The com\nmission ruled out her contention that\nthe proper interpretation of a treaty\nwhich placed the boundary line at a\npoint ten marine leagues from the shore,\nfollowing the sinuosities of the coast\nmeant a straight line drawn from one\nheadland to another, or that it meant to\nmake the coast line the onter line of the\nchain of islands that lie off the main\nshore. So that nnder the decision, the\nUnited States is sustained in its inter\npretation of the treaty in its piain word\ning. Canada gets no port on the npper\ncoast, and she never had the slightest\nchanoe to get any, on a fair award.\nWhere her own people decide against\nher, her claim must be pretty rank.\nOF INTEREST TO PROMOTORS.\nJudge Cook of tlie San Francisco Su\nperior Court has recently set aside a\nverdict in the case of George M. Pinney\nagainst Homer Nilson, brought to re\ncover "reasonable compensation” for\npromoting the sale of a mine. The gist\nof the suit was that through the efforts\nof Pinney a sale of a group of mines in\nTrinity County, belonging to Wilson\nand Charles R. Bishop was effected for\n$265,000. Before the sale Wilson agreed\nto pay Pinney a "reasonable compensa\ntion” for his services in case a sale was\neffected.\nAfter the sale, Wilson claimed the\nright to determine the amount of “rea\nsonable compensation ” that should be\npaid. To this Pinney demurred on the\nground that custom had fixed that at 10\nper cent of the sale price, and that his\nservices were worth $2*!,500. As a re\nsult of the trial that followed, the jury\nawarded Pinney $7,500. From the\nverdict Pinney appealed, and, as pre\nviously siated. Judge Cook set it aside.\nThe outcome of a new trial will be\nwatched with more than usual interest,\nespecially by mining men.\nSAVED MONEY ON HIS FUNERAL.\nDetroit Tribune: Simple and inex\npensive was the funeral of the late Lord\nSalisbury, England’s late great Premier.\nSome $70 all told was the cost of the\nobsequies. This was in accordance\nwith the statesman’s wish. He was\nrich, but abhorred ostentatious and vul\ngar display in rites to the dead and the\nburden imposed on the poor in attempt\ning what is called “a respectable funer\nal.” The dead Premier’s example is\nwholesome and in keeping with his\ngreat life; but if his were to be the lim\nit in American funerals, which are\nstrictly up-to-date as a rule and some\ntimes very "nobby,” many undertakers\nwould have to be buried at public ex\npense. The man who was “just walk\ning around to save funeral expenses”\nwas unsentimental, but built a monu\nment to his own memory more endur\ning than the fame of a Congressman.\nLIKESOME NEVADA POLITICIANS\nBed Bluff News: Schmitz, the so\ncalled Labor Union candidate (or Mayor\nof San Francisco, may be green about\nsome things but he knows how to take\ncare of hiskith and kiu.
