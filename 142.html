He\nmid that the colored people of Wagoner\nstood for tKe punishment of crime and\nthat the race had nothing to do with it.\nThey believed in good morals and de\nnounced violations of law no difference\nwho the perpetrator might be or wheth\ner Jic was black or white. They did not\nuphold crime of any kind or character\ncommitted by members of t\' eir own\ntoee and it was their duty in the present\ninstance to assist in every possible way\nto aprchend the criminal and see to it\nthai ho receives swift punishment for\nh\'s crime. It was evident the audience\napproved what ho said arid volunteors\nto assist in the search were called for\nquite a number responded and left for\nthe neighborhood where tno guilty\nwretch was supposed to" be hiding.\nOur colored citizens did tno proper\nthing in thus publicly placing them\nselves on record and it will, wo believe,\nhavo a ood moral otfeot. Wagoner\nRecord.\nA NEGRO BISHOP ELECTED\nScott Wi\'ll Be\' Sent Among The\nRiicu in Africa.\n(i i\nLos Angelef, Cnl., Ma.xjiji it is un\nofficially stated today that tho ballot\ntaken by thi Methodist General Con\nference Saturday for tho missionary\nbishops, tho result of which will be an\nnounced officially Monday morning, has\nlcsulted in tho election of Dr. I. B,\nScott of Louisiana colored) as mission\nary bishop to Africa, and Dr. W. P.\nOldhnVn and Dr. K. K. Robinpon as ad\nditionl bishops in Scuthern Asia, Dr.\nS.\'ott\'s election occasioned some sur\nprise, as it was thought that Dr.Cam\ndhor of Liberia would be tho successful\ncandidate.\nNearly all the bishops filled pulpits\ncither at the morning or evening servi\nces in this city and nearby towns.\nWhile Monday, Ma 30, is the day set\nfor the final adjournment -of the confer\nence, it is believed that practically all\ntho important business will have been\ncompleted before tne end of the presont\nweek.\nTwo subj cts will doubtless cause a\nspit-hod debate during the next few days\nnamely, the amus&mnnt que t on nn1\nthe relations of capital and labor. The\nlatter was made tne subject of a special\nroport from tho jupiciary committee last\nweek, in which vigorous denunciation\nwas mado of tho "greed of corporations\nand their indifforonoo-to tho welfare of\ntheir employes."\nIt was sought to have the conference\npass the resolutions reported by the\njudiciary tcommittco as the expression of\nthe body, but strong opposition devel\noped, when it was mado the., special or\nder for Tuesday morning.

Some of these men, particu\nlarly John W. Martin, of North\nCarolina, objected to the presence\nof the Negro. Mr. Martin, see\ning that there were number of\nv .cant frames, asked that he be\ntransferred to another \'alley.\'\nAlter waiting a few days Martin\nsaw that t")e foreman, D. J. Rob\nerts of Kansas had no disposition\nto g ant his request He told the\nforeman that the situation was\ndistasteful to him by reason o\nthe presence of the Negro.

This Is especially the case with\nold orchards that are being cultivated\nfor tho first time. In tho caso of an\norchard that has been cultivated right\nalong there can bo Httlo or no harm\nIn cultivating at any tlmo of year. It\nwill then stop growing In midsummer\nand will spend tho rest of Its tlmo\nand onergy In hardening up Its wood.\nBut tho orchnrd that has not been\nmuch cultivated or even that has not\nbeen cultivated In the spring of this\ny jar will be injured by giving It extra\nattention of this kind in the late\nsummer .and fall. If, however, the\ntrees are carrying a heavy crop of\nfruit, cultivation may bo continued\nlater than if tho trees aro bare or\nhavo little fruit on them. Tho extra\namount of plant food set loose will\nthen go into tho fruit that is belne\nproduced nnd tho late development\nof buds and of wood will not occur.\nIn fact, in dry climates and dry sea\nsons the lato cultivation may prevent\nthe fruit-laden trees from becoming\nweakened from laclc of moisture. Then\nas thoro Is a great deal of loss of\nmoisture from the uncultivated ground\nnnd tho fruit on tho trees is requiring\na great deal for its development, there\nIs sometimes Injury to the tree from\nthe supply of moisture being lessensd\nor cut off.\nThomas Campbell, an Oklahoma\nCity special pollco officer, was bound\nover tho grand Jury lu tho sum of\n?r.00 for shooting a negro whom ho\nfound stealing coal. Tho shot struck\ntho negro In tho log, but was not serious.\nA meeting, looking towards the\nmerging of tho bar associations of\ntho two territories, has boon called\n.to meet at Oklahoma City Juno 4.

There woro twenty-eight appli.\ncants for tho position.\nTobacco for Wooly Aphis.\nTobacco dust can be obtained from\nthe groat tobacco manufacturing es\ntablishments for about one cent pet\npound If purchased in largo quantities.\nSomo of our best investigators of in\nsect troubles of tho orchurd say that\nthis dust is a destroyer of wooly aphis\nand enn be used to advantago around\novory fruit treo that Is or has been\naffected. Tho usual mode of appli\ncation is to dig away tho soil from\naround tho trco to a distance of two\nfoot each way and to a depth of say\nfour Inches. About five pounds of the\ntobacco dust is spread over this place\nand tho dirt put back. This is to\nprovont the dust bolng blown away\nby the winds or washed away by the\nrains. Tho rain that falls will carry\ntho nicotine from tho tobacco to all\nparts of tho roots of tho treo affected\nby tho aphis and they will bo killed.\nIt will also prevent tho coming of\nother broods of tho aphis. Tho to\nbacco Is worth for fertilizer all it\ncosts, and its Insecticldal valuo Is an\nabsoluto gain. Tho work of nppllca\ntlon may therefore bo set down as\ntho only cost of tho protection it a\nfords.\nTho Scottish Hitq Masons of South\nMcAlester havo let a contract for on-\nlargtng their tqmplo.

Tho bride\'s paronts ac\ncompanied the pair to witness tho\nmarriage. Hill, it Is said, prior to the\nwedding, deeded hlo big farm and\ngave 1,S00 to his Intended bride.\nJim Wallace has beon commlted to\nJail at Ardmore, without ball, on tho\ncharge of having killed his wife near\nWiley May llUh.\nThe New Strawberry Bed.\nTho now strawberry bed can bo so\nmanaged thnt It will require tho least\ncaro and will produce tho largest pos\nsible amount of fruit. Wo think It n\ngreat mistake to allow tho vines to\noccupy most of tho ground as they\nare allowed to do In too many gar\ndens. Wo havo seen such a bed on\ntho second season becomo a solid\nmass, with tho result that tho berries\naro small and hard to pick. The next\nyear ovory Inch of space Is covered\nwith plants aud generally no fruit to\nspeak of is secured. If the hedce-row\nsystom is followod tho results will bo\nbetter and tho bed may bo kept for\nseveral years without being renewed.\nThat method is to allow the plants to\ngrow say six inches apart and the\nrest of tho ground Is kept clcam of\nboth plants and weeds. The roots of\nthe plants havo -an abundance of feed\ning ground and gather largo quanti\nties of plant food for tho making of\nthe crop of berrleis. Tho row of straw\nberries will not then be generally\nmore than one foot across, and the\nrows should bo at least three foet\napart measuring from centor to center.\nMust Look fttr Prevention as Well as\nCure of Disease\nNot only he engineers, but also tho\ndoctors, will havo much work to do in\nconnection with tho construction of\ntho Panama canal. The health con\nditions In tho vicinity aro very bad;\nJt would be difficult to find worse.\nTho Chagres fever, which Is peculiar\nto this region being named, indeed,\nafter tho river of that name prevails\nconstantly, and Is a very serious men\nace to tho lives of men from tho\nnorth. I am confident that it can be\nstamped out, but this will bo a difficult\ntask, well worthy of tho efforts of\ntho best medical ability in this coun\ntry. Tho climate Itself is not unfavorable\nto health. Tho danger lies in the\nswamps on tho coast and In the abso\nlute lack of sanitation in the towns.\nThe swamps will havo to be drained\nand a civilized sanitary system put\nInto oporatlon. This work must be\nunder tho direction of a medical man\nof firmness, sound ideas and strong\noxecutlvo ability. Though tho man\nual labor on the canal will bo done\nby acclimated natives, a large number\nof men from the United States will\nbo employed as superintendents for\nother work requiring skill and edu\ncation. Many young American civil and me\nchanical engineers are looking to\nPanama for opportunities, and there\nwill be places for a considerable pro\nportion of thoso who want them. The\nlives of these men are too valuable to\nbe sacrificed to unhonltliful conditions\nthat can be remedied. Some of the\nfirst and most Important undertak\nings In tho canal country must be\nprosecuted by physicians.

In the building\nup of this vnst domain it has been one\nof the chief factors.\nOne hundred years ago tho popula\ntion of tho region was estimated at\n20,000. Up-to the inception of the\nUnion Pacific (In 18C0) it had in\ncreased to 3,233,529. In 1900 it num\nbered over 13,000,000 of inhabitants.\nIn this wonderful growth, with its. stu\npendous increase In all the many-sided\nphases of commercial, material and\nIntellectual prosperity, tho Union Pa\ncific as a glance at tho map will\nshow has had a conspicuous share.\nIt has opened vast regions of fertllv.\ncountry to settlers, and brought grent\nareas of an unknown and unproduc\ntive wilderness Into closo communion\nwith metropolitan centers and mar\nkets. Thriving cities, towns and ham\nlets, through Its efforts, have sprung\nup In every direction.\nIt may bo of interest to know that\ntho total number of manufacturing\nplants, and tho valuo of their outputs,\ncombined with that of the national\nproducts as repotted in the census of\n1900, give an aggregate production for\ntho Louisiana region of $3,500,000,000\nannually, or 223 times tho original pur\nchase price. Tho same census reports\n(1900) also show the total population\nto bo 13,343,255, of which 8,303.096 In\nhabitants are living in the states and\nterritories reached by the Union Pa\ncific. On the 1900 census figures, it is\nestimated that tho true wealth of the\nLouisiana purchase can bo stated at\nabout $13,051,868,359, of which $9,360,\n621,387 is represented in tho states\nreached by this great railroad."\nCould You Use Any Kind of a Sewing\nMachine at Any Price?\nIf there is any price so low, any\noffer so liberal that yon would think\nof accepting; on trial a new high-grade,\ndrop cabinet or Mprlght Minnesota,\nSinger, Wheeler & Wilson, Standard,\nWhito or New Homo Sowing Machine,\ncut out and return this notice, and\nyou will rcceivo by return mail, post\npaid, freo of cost, tho handsomest sew\ning machino catalogue over published.\nIt will name you prices on tho Minne\nsota, Singer, Wheeler & Wilson,\nWhite, Standard and New Home sew\ning machines that will surprise you;\nwo will mako you a new and attract\nive proposition, a sewing machine of\nfor that will astonish you.\nIf you can make any uso of any\nsowing mnchlno at any price, if any\nkind of an offer would interest you,\ndon\'t fail to write us at once (bo suro\nto cut out and return this special no\ntico) and get our latest book, our\nlatest offers, our now and most sur\nprising proposition.

In a\nrecent letter to Tho Peruna Mcdieino\nCo., from Washington, D. 0., says:\nil can recommend Perunm for dys\npepsia and stomach trouble.

Butler.\nTiin rmlv rntinnnl wrtv to cure dvs-\npepsia is to remove tho catarrh. Peruna\ncures catarrh. Peruna docs not produco\nartificial digestion. It cures catarrh\nand leaves tho stomach to perform diges\ntion in a natural way. This is vastly\nbutter and safer than resorting to arti\nlicial methods or narcotics.\nPcruna has cured more cases of dys\npepsia than all other remedies com\nbined, simply becauso it cures catarrh\nwherever located. If catarrh is located\nin the head, Peruna cures it. If catarrh\nhas fastened itbelf in the throat or\nltvrmoliml fnlM. Parana cures it. When\ncatarrh becomes sottled in tho stomach,\nPcruna cures it, as well in this location\nus in any other.\nPeruna is not simply a remedy for\ndyspepsia.
