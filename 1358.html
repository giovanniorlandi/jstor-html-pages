        <pre>["i $olii-iu County democrat\nEntered at the Postefflce at Itosedale,\nMiss., as second-class matter.\nSUBSCRIPTION SI.MPERYEAR.\nA- D. LINNELL. .Editor\nI6TH SECTION FUNDS.\nTreisinr SilRits Report ti Bo ird Cow\n| log Torn.\nAt Monday’s meeting of the\nboard of supervisors there was sub\nmitted for their inspection a de\ntailed statement of the various\n16th section funds of the county,\ns covering the four years that Treas\nurer Stafford has been their cus\ntodian. This report was carefully\ncomplied by Hon. W. B. Roberts,\nvice-president of the Valiev Bank\nof Rosedale, which institution has\nbeen the depository of the county’s\nfunds. Mr. Roberts is splendidly\ncapable of preparing this report,\nand it may be taken for granted\ninsofar as his knowledge of the\ncondition of these funds goes, the\n: showing made is correct. Inas\nmuch as there has existed for years\na desire on the part of the people\nof the county that a showing of\nthese funds be made, the board\ndeemed it nothing less than its\n• . I- -- It.\nUUiy tv uavv ~ —\nthe county papers.\nIt is claimed by those who are\nin a position to know something of\nthe shape in which these funds\nhave been kept for many years\nthat their present status presents\nan extremely “tangled spool,” and\none that it will be utterly imposs\nible to straighten out; that for the\nreason that care has not been ex\nercised in properly separating\nthem, and because of the fact that\nthe records are so meager as to\nwhom, when and in what amounts\nthey have been loaned; the failure\nto separate the interest as it has\nbeen loaned; the failure to separate\nthe iuterest as it has been paid in\nso that each fund might receive its\n■proper amount, has rendered the\ntask of checking them up at this\nlate day a matter of impossibility.\nAnH the one thing sought by the\nboard in the publication of the re\nport is to direct the attention of the\npeople of the county to the various\nitems covered in the hope that per\nsonal recollection may aid in cor\nrecting errors that may exist.\nThat the funds are in their pres\nent condition is to be regretted,\nbut regrets will not remedy the\nmatter. The thing is to work and\nemploy the best material for their\ncorrection. This should be one\nof the first acts of the new board,\nand we express me ucuci iua. im,\nwill do it. It is suggested by Sen\nator Moore, and we believe that\nthe suggestion is as practical as\nany that the board could adopt tc\nemploy an expert accountant and\nplace him in charge of the work ol\ngoing over all the avmiable date\nback as far as any information car\nbe gleaned. Let him correct the\ncondition of these various funds as\nfar as possible, and then let his re\nport form the basis for a new start\ning point in their accounting,\nProfit by the experience of the past\nand in the future see that the cus\ntodian of these funds renders £\ncomplete and exact report of theii\ncondition, making the same a mat\nter of public record.\nThe school fuiid of this state is\na sacred one. Upon it depends ii\na large measure the education ol\nour children. That it has beei\nprevented and grossely neglected\nin the past is unfortunately true\nThese sections in the past hav<\nbeen leased for asoug, denuded ol\ntheir wealth of timber and funds\nthat have been derived from vari\nous sources laxity guarded. If al\nof them were iu cultivation toda;\nthe county would need no othe\nmoney with which to finance it\nschools for nine months in th\nyear. Let all future boards of su\npervisors rise to the full heighth o\ntheir duty iu guarding the interest\nof our school sections. Whili\nmuch ground has been lost tha\ncanneyer be recovered, we can i\nthe future guard against any tan\ngled and unsatisfactory condition\n—Cleveland Enterprise,\nBANKS TURNED DOWN.\n• ———\nFor ways that are dark and tricks\nthat are vain, the New York banks\nare peculiar, tike thejbird of prey,\nthey are always perched on the\nhighest limb, ever on the lookout\nfor something to swoop down up\non and gobble up for their own\nbenefit, They are a could, selfish\nand grasping lot, haying no more\npatriotism than a hedgehog, and\nno more regard for the welfare of\nthe public thanj an untutored sav\nage.\nThey have done more to bring\non and perpetuate the panic than\nall other agencies combined, and\nexpect to be the beneficiaries, to\nreep large rewards when the end\ncomes, to buy up securities at the\nlowest price and advance them\nwhen well in hand, and thus make\ncolosal fortunes at the expense of\nthe poor wretches who have been\nforced to sell.\nNow comes these patriotic and\nunselfish institutions, the New\nYork banks, which have had their\nmillious tied up—other peoples’\nmillions which they had no legal\nright to hold against the wish of\ndepositors, making money scarce\nand high—ready to pounce down\nupon the $100,000,000 emergency\ncertificates, which the government\nis issuing to tide over the financial\ntroubles, and use them as “nation\nal bank reserves.” They had no\ndoubt but that the Comptroller of\nthe Currency would permit this,\nand were greatly surprised when\nthat ofliciai informed them that the\nfliroo nor nptlf PPrfimillH tint\nbe used, directly or indirectly, as\nnational bank reserves. This is\nanother official act worthy of all\ncommendation. These New Yoek\nfinanciers have been so long accus'\ntomed»to government accommoda\ntions that they are shocked when\ndenied privileges above other peo\nple.\nThe New York banks bought on\nthe panic by refusing clearance to\nthe Knlckeabroker Bank, which\nforced thai concen to suspend,\nand crash after crash to follow.\nThe bank may not have been in\nvery good 'shape but colud have\nbeen held up if its associates in\nNew York had had the foresight\nto go to its assistance, and in that\nevent the panic would have at least\nhave been postponed, if itjjliad not\nbeen prevented altogether.\nThe Secretary of the Treasury\nhas ruled that the three per cent\ncertificates can be made immedi\nately available as security for new\ncirculation, national bank notes;\nthat if registered they can be used\nbefore being eugraved, which will\ntake some little time, and that\nprinted receipts may be issued by\nthe treasurer, which can be used\ntill the receipts are ready for de\nii_ _:_t_i_\nAt VVIJ • V<*1*»1V** A<wugVI •\n■ ——\nNOTES.\nDawn of Light,\nA Mobile minister from his pul\npit criticised a woman educator be\ncause she oppsed statntory prohi\n: bition, and the latLer called upon\n■ the men to protect her.\nBuckatunia Record.\nThe rise and fall of the stock\nmarket has about as much effect\nupon the hog ind hominy the one\nhorse farmer has laid by, as the\nrise and fall of Cliickasa hay river\nhas on old Oceen.\nCrystal Springs Meteor.\nMany ladies from Mobile, includ\ning scool teacners, are beseeched\nthe Alabama legislature to vote\ndown statutory prohibition.

MISSISSIPPI\nDevoted to the Agricultural. Commercial\nend IndufttriAl Development of the Stale *\nInbornperablb Reaourcea-OC.eiel Ofgjbof\nDepartment of Agriculture and Commerce.\nBT B B. BLAKKSLEE. Jacaaos J\nThe farmers of Mississippi hold in\ntheir possession today a product that\nis worth approximately sixty mi\'lioi\ndollars in Kngiish, (ierinan or any other i\nkind of gold. Reference is. of course,\nmade to the cotton that is being held\nfor a fair price. This cotton is being\nheld for fifteen cents per pound, what it\nis actually worth, so acknowledged by\nall who are in a position to know the\nreal conditions as they exist. The two\npowerful organizations, the Fanners’\nUnion and Cotton Association, arc be\nhind the movement and success seems to\nbe theirs, although our people were not\nsufficiently supplied with warehouses\nand the necessities of life at home to\nmake the fight they went into. It ha3\nbeen a great battle, the first of its kind\nwhere the cotton planter determined to\nfix the price on his product, and has\nbeen hard fought.\nThose who had been in the habit for\nyears of saying what the planter should\nreceive for his cotton of course gave up\nthat dictation only when forced to do\nso. The big hanks in New York sent\nout letters to the smaller hanks through\nout tlie South, urging them to get the\ncotton on the market. Theodore Price\nand other cotton gamblers have tried\nevery means at their command to force\nthe holders to sell. The big wholesale\nmerchants in New York, St. Louis and\nother commercial centers have brought\nto bear ail the influence in their power\nto force the cotton on the market, hut\nin the face of ail this the loyal mem\nbers of the two organizations, as well\nas many who are not members, have\nstood as Arm as a stone wall and held\nfor the price determined upon.\nThis means a great deal to the pepole\nof Mississippi. It is an agricultural\nState and will so remain. Then if the\nplanters will get together and co-oper\nate with those from other States for a\nfair price for their product, it will\nmean millions annually to us. Our\npresent prosperity will be only the be\nginning of a period beyond the expecta\nV1UIIH Ul Ulf must U{Hnmnuc. n iiivuim\na "Greater Mississippi” in every sense of\nthe word, croakers and sore toes to the\noontrary notwithstanding.\n• * •\nThere is a farmer up in Lafayette\ncounty who is well fixed to hold his cot\nton an indefinite length of time if neces\nsary to get the price demanded. The\nLafayette County Press tells the story\nthus:\n“A few miles from Oxford lives a\nquiet, modest young man, who answers\nto the name of W. M. Rogers. Banks\nmay break, financiers may commit sui\ncide, merchants may run over their ac\ncounts with blanched faces, but Rogers\nis not concerned, save as one man sym\npathizes with another who is in dis\ntress. Listen: On less than three-fourths\nof an acre of land he raised and sold\nfor money sulad $28, turnips $10, pota\ntoes $75. Besides this, which lie did\nmostly for experiment, lie raised corn,\nmeat, oats, hay, potatoes and five bales\nof cotton on his place. On being ques\ntioned about not being able to get money\nfor his cotton he answered with a con\ntented smile that he didn\'t have to sell\nit. Next year he proposes to go into\nthe trucking business on a somewhat\nlarger scale, and is already putting out\nraspberry and strawberry plants. Yet\nsome people say that cotton is the only\nmoney crop.”\nHow is this for fortification against\nthe schemes of Theodore Price and his\ncohorts? The man who is fixed as is\nMr. Rogers can hold cotton as long as\nlie wants to and it is a pity that more\npeople are not in the same condition.\nBut we are coming to this cverv day.\nMississippi in ten more years will raise\njust as much at home as Mr. Rogers is\nraising now.\n« • •\nWell, what about that home-coming\nweek that has been proposed for next\nyear? Let’s get busy and arrange the\nplans for carrying it out- properly and\ngiving the glad hand to our one-time\nanu iiiciiub " iich i iirj uimc\nfor a visit to Mississippi. Times are so\nmuch better here now that it is possible\nthat some of them will decide to move\nback to the old home, and, of course,\nwe would be glad to have them.\n• • •\nMississippi killed approximately sev\nenty million pounds of pork last year,\nand probably considerable more this\nyear. That is the next best thing to u\nwarehouse in aiding the farmers t > hold\ntheir cotton for a fair price.\n• • •\nLet the editor of this department have\nthe result of your experiments with the\nvarious crops you have experimented\non or the success you have attained with\nlive stock or other matters of inters!\nto the farm. Give the public at large\nthe result of your work.\n• • •\nThe night rate on telephones has been\ndone away with and the rate made the\nsame as during the day, no reduction\nbeing mude in that. The furmers’ rate\noas been raised from $2 per year to\nsomething like $12 to $20, the rate at a\nlarge number of local exchanges raised\nconsiderably and the end is not yet.\nThere is nothing in which the people\nshould be more interested than tele\nphones, yet the concern that has a\nmonopoly of the business in Mississippi\nis fast putting the service out of their\nreach.\nBloomington, 111., boasts the oldest\nmusician in America, and probably in\nthe world, in the person.of Jacob Work\nheiser. He is in the J07th year of his\nage, and is still an expert violinist. One\nof his favorite solos is tile beautiful Irish\nmelodv, "The Girl I Left Behind Me.”\nFor all of his German name, it would be\nhard to deny this venerable man’s right\nto be called au American. His grand\nfather fought on the American side in\nthe Revolutionary War._\nThe familiar phrase, "the almighty\nlollar,” was coined by Washington Irv\ning In “The Creole Villuge,” which he\npublished in 1$37.\nIf there is any one thing more than\nanother that will cause the next Legis\nlature to enact stringent laws concern\ning the corporations, it is the absolute\ndisregard of the roads to treat fairly\nwith Individual shippers, or in other\nwords, the man who tnukes only a few\nshipments each year and ia not in a po\nsition to know what the rate on his\nshipments is. This has been forcibly\nbrought to the mind of the writer dur\ning the present y*ar by tbe trial\nat enforcement of the rate tin Mis\nsissippi made syrup as ordered by the\nRailroad Commission. Early in the year\na rate on this syrup was fixed at 22\ncents per hundred pounds front any one\npoint in the State to any other jioint,\nprovided that it was not necessary to go\noutside the State in reaching its des\ntination. The only exception to this\nrule was in the case where it was neces\nsarv to use two or more roads in ship\nping. Each road is entitled to a mini\nmum charge of 25 cents on any shipment\nso that if only one hundred pounds went\nover two roads the charge would be 50\ncents, nr three roads 75 cents. On the\nother hand, if the shipment was 400\npounds the rate would lte 22 eents per\nhundred, divided lietwecn two or three,\nroads, allowing each their share, which\nwould lie more than 25 cents. It has\nbeen a fearful task to get the roads to\ninstruct their agents as to this rate.\nProducers have been charged the old\nrate right along despite the attempts to\nenforce the new rate. This has been\nthe case at Centerville, McConib City,\nMagnolia, McNeil, Starkville and other\npoints too numerous to mention.\nThen what recourse is there for the\nman who has been overcharged? His\nis a small matter and he can t afford\nto employ a lawyer to collect a claim\nof a few cents or possibly a few dollars.\nThis applies to merchants and others\nalike. Some remedial legislation is\nneeded here. Our people art- deserving\nof protection. The roads have their\nregular lawyers employed by tho year\nand the individual who desires his rights\nis at a great disadvantage. This has\nbeen going along for years, then\nwould it he surprising that if, in at\ntempting to remeuy iui» me\nmight pass a law that roads would deem\nstringent and freakish? The roads ig\nnore (lie regulations of the commission\nas well as the rules of classification to\nan alarming extent with the small ship\npers, and something should be done for\ntlieir protection.\nThe commission is preparing a card\nto tack in all depots, giving the rates in\nMississippi products for the information\nof shippers, and if the roads can be\nforced to keep these notices before the\npublic the trouble will be relieved to\nsome extent. The card reads as follows:\n“The rates from this station cannot\nexceed to any station in Mississippi:\n“On native grown liny in car lots, 13\ncents per hundred pounds. Minimum\near, 20,000 pounds.\n“On native grown corn, in ear lots,\n13 cents per hundred pounds. Minimum\ncar, 24,000 pounds.\n“On native grown sweet potatoes, any\nquantity, 23 cents per hundred pounds.\n“On native grown molasses, any quan\ntity, 22 cents per hundred pounds.,\n"On native field peas, any quantity,\n18 cents per hundred pounds.\n“Minimum charge of 25 cents for each\nroad handling a shipment is allowed.\n“Bills of lading must state that pro\nducts are ‘native grown’ in order to\nsecure these rates.”\nIt, is to la* hoped that this will to a\nlarge extent relieve the trouble being\nexperienced in getting the rate on Mis\nsissippi grown products orderd by the\nRailroad Commission and accepted by\nthe roads.\n* * *\nNow that the Mississippi Legislature\nis to convene in regular session within\na few days, the question naturally arises\nas to the probable legislation by that\nbody. Will it be for the best interests\nof the State or detrimental to the best\nof our V Will if. Ilf\nthe safe and sane kind or wild and un\nstable? Will the members be prompted\nby a desire to enact just and equitable\nlaws, or by a spirit of revenge for past\ndisregard of the rights of the people?\nWill the body he recklessly extravagant\nin appropriations or penurious to a\npoint that will hinder the legitimate\ndevelopment of our resources?\nThe writer is personally acquainted\nwith n majority of the members of both\nbranches of the new lawmaking body,\nand feels safe in saying that it is well\nabove the average, composed largely\nof safe men, who will do what they\ndeem best after a careful consideration\nof the matters to come before them, xhe\nmeasure of benefit will no doubt ft.-e\nwell at their hands and those without\nmerit as they deserve. Mississippi is\nstill safe and only those with a selfish\ninterest arc uneasy about what the next\nLegislature will do.\nOnly two weeks until Christmas.

The use of whisky\nfreely and drunkenness is not the proper\nthing at all and should be discouraged\nby ail good people.\nSpeculation with other people\'s money\nis not always a safe way.

W. Fox, director of the Mississippi\nbranch agricultural experiment station\nlocated at Stoneville. The statement\nof Prof. Fox Is one of much importance,\nfor heretofore the planters of the delta\nhave regarded the fertile soil as well\nnigh inexhaustible, and year after year\nhave devoted the greater portion of\ntheir acreage to cotton. Prof. Fox\nmakes a strong plea for crop diversil\ncation in the delta.\nTraction Engines on Public Roads.\nThe board of supervisors of Coving\nton county issued an order prohibiting\nthe Blount Lumber company running\nits traction engines along the public\nhighways, the action being based on\nthe ground that the engine had broken\ndown several bridges, and that public\nroads were not intended for use by en\ngines. The matter was taken to the\nchancery court, that tribunal holding\nthat a traction engine is a vehicle, and\nhas a legal right to use public roads\nand highways, the effect of which is\nthat roads and bridges must be built\nstrong enough to carry such vehicles\nwithout breakdowns.\nDistribution of School Funds.\nThe question of amending the con\nstitution in a manner to provide a more\nequitable distribution of the common\nschool fund promises to be one of the\nmost troublesome brought before the\nannrnanhintr lptHalnfi vp uocsinn At.\nthe recent conference of county super\nintendents held in Jackson the leading\neducators of the State were unable\nfully to agree on this important matter.\nAll were of the opinion that a more\nequitable distribution is needed, but\njust how to secure it is a subject on\nwhich there is a decided variance of\nopinion.\nSeized by Creditors.\nWith assets totaling more than one\nmillion dollars and a surplus of more\nthan $300,000 liabilities, the big lumber\nmanufacturing concern of Denny & Co.\nof Moss Point, was taken possession of\nby creditors and a complete reorganiza\ntion of its finances and management\nwas effected. Five directors were\nchosen to represent London, New York,\nNew Orleans, Mobile and Moss Point\ncreditors and all the money necessary\nt*> operate the concern for the benefit of\nthe creditors was promised until every\ndollar of indebtedness shall have been\npaid.\nTo Prevent Hostile Legislation.\nThe Commercial Club of Hattiesburg\nhas taken the initiative in a movement\nto check all legislation hostile to rail\nroads and corporations by the legisla\nture, which convenes in January. It is\nproposed to bring to bear upon the\nlegislature the influence of the busi\nness interests of the entire State, and if\nnecessary representatives of these in\nterests will be sent to Jackson during\nthe session of the legislature to keep an\nsye on the bills that are offered.\nLevee Tax Exemption.\nThe announced intention of the Mis\nsissippi board of levee commissioners\nto secure a cancelation of the five-year\ntax exerap ion granted to new railroads\nbuilt in that section of the State has\naroused considerable opposition among\nprominent land-owners, who claim that\nthe repeal of such exemption would act\nas a check on the construction of new\nrailway lines, so badly needed for the\nproper development of that territory.\nJackson’s Artesian Well.\nWork on the artesian well at Jackson\nis temporarily suspended pending an\nanalysis of the water so far obtained.\nAt a depth of 1,400 feet a sand reef\nwas struck, from which there comes a\nflow of remarkably clear though very\nwarm water, which discharges at the\n— — —- V.-\'WC.w f,«uuin a JUiuuie.\nLauderdale County Fair.\nThe board of supervisors of Lauder\ndale county will ask the legislature for\nauthority to issue bonds amounting to\n>50,000, bearing 5 per cent interest, to\nmature in ten or fifteen years.

Some time later, smiled upon\nby fickle fortune, he achieved success\nand prosperity as a popular dentist,\nand soon found means to revenge his\nformer landlady\'s slight. The method\nhe adopted was simple but extremely\neffective, quite ruining the business of\nhis enemy. Directly opposite the\nboarding house he opened his new\ndental establishment, and upon the\nlargest window in bold letters ap\npeared the following notice: “Steel\npointed boarding house teeth a spe\ncialty!”\nA Sign.\n“How do you know Belinda is In\nlove?” asked father.\n“Because,” answered mother, “every\ntime the telephone rings she tnmku\nit’s for her.”—Washington Star.\nBOTH GAINED\nMan and Wife Fatten on Grape-Nuts.,\nThe notion that meat is necessary\nfor real strength and the foundation\nof solid neEh Is no longer as prevalent\nbe formerly.\nKxcessivc meat eaters are usually\nsluggish a part of the time because\nthey are not able to fully digest their\nfood, and the undigested portion is\nchanged into what is practically a\nkind of poison that acts upon the\nblood and nerves, thus getting all\nthrough the system.\n“I was a heavy meat eater,” writes\nan liis. man, “and up to two years\nago, was in very poor health. I suf\nfered with indigestion so that I only\nweighed 96 pounds.\n“Then I heard about Grape-Nuts and\ndecided to try it. My wife laughed at\nme at first but when I gained to 125\npounds and felt so fine, she thought\nshe would eat Grape-Nuts too.\n"Now she is fat and well and has\ngained 40 pounds. We never have in\ndigestion any more and seldom feel\nthe desire for meat. A neighbor of\nours, 68 years old, was troubled with\nindigestion for years; was a heavy\nmeat eater, and now since he has been\neating Grape-Nuts regularly, he says\nhe is well and never has indigestion.\nI could name a lot of persons who\nhave really been cured of indigestion\nby changing from a heavy meat diet\nto Grape-Nuts.” "There’s a Reason."\nName given by Postuni Co., Battls\nCreek.

Let us consider the\nfacts of the case. You were spending\nChristmas with your aunt, Mrs. Glen\ntorridon, in the country. One evening,\nas you were passing along a darkened\n, corridor, on the way to your room,\nyou met a certain gentleman—”\n"He wasn\'t a gentleman,” she inter\nposed quickly.\n"Oh!” I exclaimed. "I certainly\nthought that your aunt’s guests—”\n"He wasn’t a true gentleman,” she\nadded disdainfully, “or he wouldn’t\nhave acted as he did."\n"A discourteous gentleman, then—\nwho taking advantage of the darkness,\ndeliberately kissed you upon—’’\n"Don\'t be ridiculous!” she snapped.\n“I asked you to help me.”\n“I am endeavoring to do so,” said I.\n“Then do it properly!” I assumed\nan air of profound gravity. Kitty rc\nj garded me thoughtfully out of a cor\nner of her deep blue eye. “You see,”\nshe continued, “I don’t know who it\nwas—and—well, you know, it makes\nit rather awkward for me.”\n[ "Didn’t you see his face?” I asked.\n“No,” she answered. “He came up\nbehind, and—and it was all over !r>.\nta second.” She shuddered prettily. “It\nwas quite dark,” she added, “and I\never earn the gratitude of.

I wished now that\nI had waited before casting suspicions\nupon the hospitable captain and the\nInfluential Mr. Porter, both of whom\nwould doubtless cut me dead In the\nfuture. But, ala^l when a man is In\nmy condition, he— Suddenly an idea\noccurred to me.\n"Very well, my fine fellow,” i said,\nthrusting the letter into my pocket.,\n"we shall see—what we shall see. He\nwho laughs first, laughs worst. This\nwill settle your little game, at any\nrate!”\nIII.\nMiss Mainwarlng was at home. I\nmade my way up to the dainty blue\nand -white shrine in which Kitty re\nceived her most devoted worshippers.\nI found her standing by a small tea\ntable In the center of the room when\nI entered.\n"Ah,” she exclaimed, running to\nmeet me, “I am glad you have come!”\n"Not more so than I am,” I replied,\npressing her hand warmly.\n"Oh, heaps!” she said gaily. "I am\nJust dying to hear the news. Have\nyou discovered anything?”\n“I have,” said I, taking a seat by\nthe testable. "I have discovered ev\nery thing.”\nShe clapped her hands delightedly.\n“You dear old thing!” she cried. "1\nknew you would. Who was it?”\n"It was that misguided nephew of\nmine,” I announced gloomily.\nFor a moment I thought she was\ngoing to get up and dance round the\nroom. Then suddenly she became\ngrave, and the light died out of her\neyes.\n“Oh!” she remarked, “it was Jack,\nwas it?”\n“Yes," s»id I, “It was Jagk.”\nShe poured out a cup of tea and\ni\nonly saw his shirtfront. He was in\nevening dress, you know.”\n"Hut were there no distinguishing\nfeatures, such as a shirt stud, or—a\nmoustache?” I suggested.\n“Oh, yes!" she responded quickly,\n“he had a moustache: and I think he\nwas tall, because he had to bend down\nwhen —when he did it. His shirt stud\nwas a plain gold one, I believe.”\nI “Well,” said I, "how many tall men\nj were there in the party who possessed\n/ moustaches and plain gold shirt\nstuds ?"\n“Let me see," she mused; "there\nwas Capt. Jack Harland, Mr. Porter,\nand your nephew Jack.”\nI frowned severely. Jack was an\nImpertinent young rascal, whose pre\nsumptuous attentions to Kitty Main\nwaring had disgusted me on several\noccasions.\n“Jack,” I said, "is quite capable of\nbehaving in such a disgraceful man\nner.”\n“Yes,” she assented, almost cheer\nfully; “but I don\'t think it was Jack.\nAt least,” she added with a bright\nsmile, “I want you to be a dear old—\n1 mean, a good, kind-hearted person,\nand fled out for me.”\n• •Is nk_ii T /Iflurl Hairin\'\nboth to the occasion and to take my\nleave.\nII.\nIt is one thing to make a promise\nIn all the glow of a generous moment,\nand another thing to keep it in the\nI cold, practical light of after-reasoning.\nHowever, I did the best that I could.\nIn the first place I wrote to Jack, who\nwas then at Harvard, and, without di\nvulging the source of my information,\n| atated briefly what had come to my\nknowledge, and asked him If he could\nthrow any light on the matter. It was j\n^ some two or three days before I re\nceived his reply which was ch&acter\nf latically brief and ran:\n"Dearest Uncle:—I received your\nletter containing a vivid description\nf of what you term the ‘shameful out\nrage.’ Now, I don\'t mind confessing\nto you that I am the culprit, because\nyou have been young yourself (once),\nend know that the path of youth\' is\nstrews, eto. Besides, there were ex\ntenuating circumstances iu Ibis case.\nf-Jke the decent old sort you are, make\n•t right tor me with the girl, and for\npassed it to me, keeping her eyes fixed\non the tea-cosy the while.\nThen we talked about other matters\nuntil it was time for me to go.\n"Good-bye,” she said; “and thank\nyou for taking so much trouble.”\n"It was no trouble,” I assured her.\nOne must do the polite thing, you\nknow, at any cost.\n“I can only hope,” I continued, “that\nin time you will be able to forgive my\nnephew for such an act of gross im\npertinence.”\n"Ah, yes!” she answered warmly, “I\nthink—yes, I am really very glad it\nwas Jack."\n“Oh!” I ejaculated sharply.\n"Rather than one of the others,” she\nconcluded hastily.\nIV.\nI wandered disconsolately in a less\nfrequented part of the avenue trying\nto think things out. It was now close\nupon a month since my last tete-a-tete\nwith Kitty, and during that time I had\nnever once been able to catch her\n■Ion*. Indeed, on most of the occa\nsions when I called she was owi •\npiece of bad luck I had not hitherto\nbeen accustomed to; and when I did\nfind her In, she wag either surrounded\nby friends, or engaged In elaborate\nsewing operations which necessitated\nthe constant attendance of her maid.\nOnce or twice, too, I caught sight of\nMaster Jack in town, when by the\ncalendar he ought to have been purau\ning his studies; and the circumstance\ncoupled with his obvious anxiety to\navoid me, filled my mind with a vague\nforeboding.\n"What the deuce does it mean?" 1\nasked myself, as I strode along with\neyes thoughtfully bent upon the\nground, regardless alike of passers-by\nand the people who would have passed\nby had I not collided with them.\nI cannoned off an eminent dignitary\nof the church, and ran full tilt against\na smartly dressed couple who were\ndodging round the episcopal back. (1\ncould only see the billowy edging of\na dainty skirt—and what not—above a\nstill daintier ankle, and the bottoms\nof a pair of immaculately creased trou\nsers.) My murmured apology was cut\nexcessively short as I raised my hat\nand my eyes at tho same time. It was\nJack and Kitty, looking very spic and\nspan, and no little pleased with them\nselves.\n“Eh? What!” I gasped, taken some\nwhat aback.\nKitty’s smile was as the wine of\nOporto in its intoxicating sweetness.\n“Oh,” she cried, "it is Mr. Walker!"\n“It is.” said I, frowning at her levity.\nI was feeling in no particularly light\nmood myself just then.\nShe pouted and turned to her com\npanion.\n“Don’t you think, Jack,” she said,\n“you ought to tell your uncle about—\nabout it?”\n“Certa\'nly,” responded that young\nhopeful. “You will, my dear uncle, be\ndelighted to learn that I have just ob\ntained Mrs. Mainwaring’s consent to\nmy engagement with Kitty here.”\n“Hum—ah—exceedingly delighted—\npray accept my congratulations,” I\nstammered.\n"Thanks!” said Jack. “I thought\nyou would be pleased." The young\nvagabond actually winked as he said\nthis.\n“Ah, yes—of course,” said I, with\na futile attempt at dignity. "Kitty is a\ncharming—that is, you Will both be—\ner—very happy.”\n“We mean to be, he asserted stout\nly. “Don\'t we, little woman?”\n“Yes,” che whispered softly, press\ning his arm with her daintily gloved\nhand. Irony of ironies! I had bought\nthose gloves!\n“I\'ll look you up this evening at\nyour club," said Jack, making as If to\nmove on.\n“Yes—do,” said I.\nThey departed in a blustering gale\nof laughter, two young, handsome, per\nfectly mated creatures, and I—\nI jammed my hat firmly down upon\nmy head, and walked away as If the\nlove affairs of a mere boy and girl\ncould have no Interest for a confirmed\nold bachelor of something and forty.\nKitty and I are the best of friends\nstill. She is Mrs. Owen now, and doss\nnot seem at all to regret having\nthrown herself away upon a worthless\nyoung scamp like Jack.
