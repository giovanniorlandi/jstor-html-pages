The present di^^lemma of Mr. (Jumpers, for Instance,^may M cited as a suttli lent example^of this truth.\nForyears this veteran combatant^In Hi^ ranks of organized labor has^n.ntllastly set his face against polit^^ical action as a tactic of the labor^struggle I ml'r his Influence and^thut id his muny associates the watch^^word of No polltlca In the union^ be^^came almost a fundamental article of^faith In the creed of American trade\nunionism.'I'll, member who sought^to bring the claims of socialism to^the attention of his fidlovv unionists^anil urged tin m to political action in^tin- Interest of labor was universally^regarded either as a fool who could^not realize the disastrous effect of tin\nadoption of Ills Views, or It llellln rat.\n'malignantwho from wilful malicious^^ness sought knowingly to wreck the^structure of organized la Inn\nJudgingfrom his writings.

It Is,^on the contrary, a result of a long\nsirles of losing battb s in which labor^unionism, under the leadership ol^Mr. Qompi-ra, has engaged, defeats^which have forced upon him th. MM*^ful innovations of politics in the^unions. Defeat, not socialism, has^been the main n-ason for this ad^^vance\nAndvve soclallsta who have for so^manv veur* urgi-d political action up^^on tin unions, and been apparently^dfti-atfil by Mr. Compirs and his as-^MClMMj vvi- are in tl:e position of see^^ing thut the thin.- w^^ fought lor haa^come about In spite of our defeat and^when It came it turned out not to be^what we m.-ant, as Morris oImm rves In^the quotation at the head of this ar^^ticle.\nThepolitics for union mi n thla^time, says Mr. (lumpers In effect, are^democratic politics. And as a r. ply^to thla dictum, hundreds ot thousands^of workingm.-n who hubitiiully vote^the republican ticket, and other hun^^dreds of thousunds who r.s. nt any^interference with their supposed ^In^^dependence^ In mutters political, are^preparing to impress upon Mr. (Jum^^pers by still another defeat, that his^conception of politics In tin- unions^^turns out to lie not what they^m.-ant.^ It will be left mainly to^those who have followed Mr (lum^^pers' teachings in matters pertaining^to trades unionism to convince him^that the ^emancipation of labor'^through political action, lies not that^way.\nAllthis the socialist can view with^complacent satisfaction. Though he^well knows that the elements of op^^position which Mr. Conipers has^raised against himself in the ranks^of labor by his endorsement of demo^^cratic politics have little or no con^^ception of the ultimate result of frus^^trating Mr. Comp. rs efforts, he knows^both themselves and their leaders^still another step nearer the only^tenable position from which the class^struggle can be fought to a victorious^linish^the tield of socialist political^action\nTothe socialist who has not learned^path nee from a long experience c,f^lieing imp.it. int. this process may\neemsomi what irritating by Its ih -^lay- Hut none the less, It Is the^rneth...| of economic evolution.

W'e had all the circumstance*^with which you are so familiar in thla^country.\nTheLabor party drafted a bill to^n nn dr that state of affairs, and the^object of course of the bill was thla:^That a trades union and trades union^fund* should not, under any circum^^stances, be the object of a suit at law^at the instance of an employer. The.^object of the bill was to make It Im^^possible for the employer* through^the law court* to cripple or interfere^with the work of the trades union .^movement during a trade dispute.\nNowremember there wore only SI-^workingmen in the house of com^^mons out of 670. That both the lib^^eral and tory parties were against^our bill. That naturally the house^of lords was against the bill. That^practically every newspaper In Great^Britain was against the bill, and at^the back of all that we had the re^^port of a royal commission opposed^to our hill.\nAsignificant Victory.^^The liberal giwrnment brought^in a bill of its own In opposition to^ours.

Debs, presidential candidate of the^socialist party These charges were^published In the American Federa-^tionist for Sept'-mbor. No proof ac-^companii d them. None MM will l^e^pr. s. nt. d. for the charges arc abso^^lutely false. The only thing which^the\\ prow is the character of Gom-^pers.\nTwoprincipal allegations ar. made^in this attack upon Debs.\nMr.Gompt-rs says: ^He (Delta) or^^ganized th. American Railway [Talon^and became Its president in rivalry to^the organization whose official he still^was. He worked and plotted for the^destruction of the organization of^which he was a responsible official.\nThetruth Is that when E. V. Del^s^deciibd to form the A. It. I^, he went^befor- the convention of the B. of L.^F. and after explaining his plans to^them tendered his resignation as sec-^retary-treasuri r and editor of the of^^ficial organ, which positions he had^h- M for thirteen years. During this^time there had never liecn a candi^^date or a vote cast against him. The^convention unanimously refused to ac^^cept his resignation, although its^members thoroughly understood that^he was about to undertake th. ..r-..m-^ization of the A. R. I^. ^ ^n the con^^trary, they unanimously rs tlsetl 1^him Hut he felt that he should not^hold the otflce and again tendered his^resignation, insisting upon Its ac^^ceptance. When the convention saw^that he was determined to resign, it^voted unanimously to give him $2,000^with which to take a vacation. A^check for that amount was sanded to^him. but he refused to accept it and^the check remains uncashed to this^day.\nFurthermore,within the last year a^special otflcial invitation to renew his^membership has been extended by th^B. of K I*, Finally he now has in his^possession an official invitation from^the governing body of that organiza^^tion asking him to become the Official^mu st of th. B. of F. L. at Its n. xt^grand lodge meeting. The men who^have extended this invitation do not^agree with him politically, and would^not do these things did liny consider^him a traitor to their organization.\nMr.(iomp. rs says of the A. II D^strike of 1S!M: ^When a large num^^ber of men In the American Railway^I'nbm responded to Mr. Debs' call to^strike, and many became blacklisted^and victimized, he advocated and fin^^ally secured the abandonment of th^American Railway I'nlon. and thus^l. ft his no n hitch and drv without^the sIlKhtest organized protection.\nHadthis statement be. n made by^an otflcial of the Citizens' Alllanc It^might i e possible to pb-ad Ignorant^as an ^ xcuse. It is but a variation of^the fre^tnnt charge of the enemies^of organized labor that strikes nr.^called by union officials Hut Mr.^QMAIMfg cannot plead ignorant.. ||,^was In an official position during that^strike and played a part which h. w ill^not care to have recalled. Therefore^he will not dare to deny that when he^peiin. .1 that statement he knew that^Debs opposed that strike to the vi ry^last, and that It was finally ilecltl.-d^upon by a unanimous vote of the^governing body of the organization.^Far from deserting the men Debs^stayed and fought with tin m even^while a president elected by the polit^^ical party for which Mr. (Jumpers Is^now asking the support of organized^labor sent federal troops to shoot^down the strikers. Mr. dumpers was^at the head of a great labor organiza^^tion at that time. l^t him explain^what assistance he gavi In this hour^tt ib sp. rat. m i d, when Eugene V.^Debs stood flKhting for the men who^had trusted him until he was impris^^oned and his organization disrupt.,!^and destroyed. Today thousands of^those old A. It. lT. men are lighting^ami working for the success of the so^^cialist party. Their action speaks^louder than words as to whether^Debs betrayed thetn In their hour of^in . tl\nMr.(lumpers makes another chance^He says:\nWhenMr. Delis was secretary of^lie r.rotherhood of Locomotive .^^ire-^men and editor of Its official tnaga-^zlne, thut organization held one of its^conventions In Cincinnati. He had^given the order for the convention^printing to a concern which hud a^contest on with the Cincinnati Typo-^graphical union. A committee of Cin^^cinnati union printers called upon\nMr.Debs to ask him to use the In^^fluence of his position to urge the^printing company to come to an ami^^cable agreement with the union, or,^falling In that, to give the convention^printing to a union house. Did Mr.^Debs comply with that request^ Not^a bit of it. He Insulted the committee^and told tty m he wanted nothing to^do with them or their union.\nThisstatement is a plain malicious^lie. No such Incident ever took place.^No such committee ever came to Debs.^No printing was given out by him to^any non-union house. Let Mr. Qom-^piTs either produce some member of^that committee or stand convicted of\nc.vvardlv malicious lying.\nHereare some facts concerning tie^actli ns of E. V.

Most of his time\npreviouslyhad In spvnt In cattle\nandranching. Mrs. Hazlett spoke in^substance as follows:\nWeare gathered here this aft. r-^noon to pay the last sad rites to our^young friend so rudely snatched from^lit. and his fond loved ones, In his^manhood's prime He was taken In^the glow of life's glad morning, and^whil. the joy of life's achievement^was still before him It was not given^to him to know the thirst and the heat^and the toll of the midday of life.^He has gone while the bloom was on^the rose, the dew on the lily, the lark^In th sky, the song In the heart. If^th. iv could be a consolation to those^who grieve for their nearest and dear^^est It would be In the knowledge that^th^ v..ung and ardent were not to^know the blight of hopes withered,^ili i ,i\\i-il and fallen on the lonely and^ib so'atc wastes of life under the bitter^reign of injustice that man visits upon^his fellow man. It is indeed almost^a comfort to the heart to think that^those who pass out of our lives and^our love so early are not to have the^bitterness of life's disappointments,^the eflll Ity of friendships betrayed,^IMP sweet trust ond our confidence^turned traitor, hatred and greed sere^the heart because the law of gain has^killed the law of broth* rhood.\nThisyoung man laid down the bur-^Ion of life a victim to social wrongs.^He was not snatched from life through^livine will, but through the greed of^man, through the rapacity of giant^industries that prize profits more thi'n^human life. Our brother had a right^to his life; he had a right to happiness^and the world's opportunities. He^was cut out of what the world had to^give, because society permits a gov^^ernment and a social condition that^murders human beings by the thou^^sands in order that a few may lead^lives of unrestrained luxury.\nButa death like this prints its in^^effable lessons on those that are left,^and shapes the high resolve that M^give our every effort, strength and In^^fluence to en-ate a different social en^^vironment where life Is sacred and^justice protects every activity.\nBrother,rest thee. Thy work is^done. Thy journey is ended. All na^^ture rests, and In nature we rest. If^lit. is good so also is death good, as it^is a part of nature.\nTothe mother, she who has been^robbed through the blind greed of a^soulless machine, our hearts turn with^i sympathy that cannot approach that^sacr. d grief. But those of us who^have known th^- noble courage of her^natiin know how dear to her is the^truth of nature, Hbove all forms, cus^^toms and superstitions, and the hope^that glimmers across this gloom for^her is her wish and h^ r work that^th. re may be a future In this world^where all may have equal opportunity,^and where protection may be given to\n^very life.^The beautiful selection on Death\nfromWalt Whitman's Calamus^ was^then r.ad, and th. discourse closed^with th.- last stanza from Bryant's\nThanatopsls.\nTin-occasion was one not to be for^^gotten by those ass. nihb d.
