        <pre>['[THE: ALASKA DAILY EMPIRE, VOL II.. NO. 216. JUNEAU, ALASKA. TUESDAY. JULY 22, 1913. PRICE TEN CENTS, Lawyers Trying To, Establish Self-Defense, That That N. C. Jones, for shoot, ing whom Joseph MacDonald is on, trial, admitted before his death that, the shooting was his own fault, and, that he asked the Lord to care for, him, was again testified to this morn- i, ing. The witness who gave this evi, dence was R. A. Kinzie, superintend, ent of the Treadwell mines. Mr. Kin, zie was assistant superintendent when, MacDonald was superitnendent. The, testimony of Mr. Kinzie was introduced, as a part of the proof of the defense\'s, claim of self-defense. Testimony on, this branch of the case was introduced, yesterday afternoon and this morn, ing. Dr. I. H. Moore, Hospital Assist, ant John l*uddens and Undertaker A., N. Church all testified to the condi, tion of the body, and the powder burns, that indicated that the men were close, together when the shooting occurred., Moore and Luddens testified to seeing, blood on MacDonald\'s clothing, to, show that the men were in actual con, tact at the time of the struggle that, it will be attempted to prove took, place., Powder Burns Tests Made., The defense this morning introduced, testimony to show how close it would, be necessary for a gun to be to the, object in order to produce powder, burns. The testimony was in the na- 1, ture of a practical test made by B. L., Thane, H. J. Raymond, B. M. Bejir, ends and James McCloskey. They, took a side of fresh pork, covered it, with one thickness of woollen, one, of cotton and one of blue serge cloth, ing similar in thickness as that the, testimony shows that Jones wore, when he was shot, and fired into it, with a revolver at distances of two,, four, aix, eight and ten inches. It, was shown that the wounds in the pork, made at distances of two and four, inches were powder burned, that at, six inches very slightly so. and those, at eight and ten inches were not, burned at all., All the men named as having made, the test, swore as to the manner they, made it, etc. The piece of pork was in- 1, troduced in evidence as an exhibit., Kinzie Ttakes Stand., R. A. Kinzie then took the stand., He testified that he did not see the ;, shooting, but heard the shots, and was, on the ground shortly afterward. He \', saw Jones after the latter had been, taken into the store and laid on a, counter, and he says Jones was alive, and talking. The most of his talking, was in the nature of prayers to the j, Ix>rd to care for him. He said, also, j, that Jones had said that the affair, was all his own fault. He did not re, member the exact language of Jones,, but he was positive as to the purport, of what he said., Impeaches Mrs. Olson., Kinzie also testified that Mrs. Anna, Olson, who testified for the govern, ment that she had seen the shooting, and that the men were not touching, each other and that Jones had nothing, in his hands but a stick, which he was j, waiving, had hold him, Kinzie, that, she had not seen the shooting or the, men at the time of the shooting., At the taking of the noon recess, the cross examination of Kinzie was in, progress. The government was hav, ing him identify points on the map of, the grounds where the tragedy had oc, curred, and as to the occupants of the, nearby buildings., Introduce Self-Detense Testimony., J. H. Cobb was the first witness to, give evidence to sustain the conten, tion of the defense in the MacDonald, case that Jones attacked MacDonald, with a gun before the latter shot him., He said that he saw the gun that it, was alleged that Jones had at the cor, oner\'s inquest. He had previously tes, tified that he "saw blood on his (Mac, Donald\'s) sleeve and cufTs and coat, front, and a drop or two on his pants.", He also testified that at the time of, the coroner\'s inquest no one question, ed that there had been a struggle be, tween MacDonald and Jones before, the shooting. That one eye-witness to, the struggle ? Tony A. Tubbs ? testi, fied at the coroner\'s inquest., Dr. I. H. Moore testified that the, wounds on Jones were powder-burned,, that the bullets that were fired in the, body ranged upward. This testimony, was offered to show that the men were, close to gether when the shots were, fired., Dr. Moore said that he had made, two examinations. One of them was, in the hospital before the inquest and, the other in the dead house next day., At the latter time he probed the, wounds. In addition to a wound, above the hip and one in the chest,, there were wounds in both arms. He, said that the wound above the hip, ranged inward and upward, and, showed the most powder burns. He, said the wounds in the arms had not, broken any bones., Dr. Moore also testified that he saw, blood on MacDonald\'s cufTs and, sleeve., Dr. Moore also qualified at? an ex, pert, and testified a8 to the tendency, of men seized with a homicidal man, ia, where they are possessed with the j, idea that they have been called by, God to kill somebody, to carry out that, command., Admits Friendly Interest., On cross examination Dr. Moore tes- j, tilied that he had not examined the, clothing for powder burns. He said, the outer clothing had been re, moved from the body. He said that !, he had made the second examination, because the statement had been made, in his presence that MacDonald had, been shot in the back, and he desired, to see whether or not that was true., Dr. Moore admitted that he was in, terested in the outcome of the case, against MacDonald, as a friend of Mac, Donald. He said that he had received, $1,000 at Fairbanks to pay his expens, es in coming out from Ruby, and that, he had since received $750. He de, nied that he wanted the case to come, up again, or that he had ever express- 1, ed a desire to have it come up again., Dr. Moore Explains Use of Money., On redirect examination Dr, Moore said that he was a practicing, physician at Ruby, and that it cost, him $900 to get from there to Juneau,, of which $750 was paid to Jack La- 1, mont for his time and that of his dog, team to take him from Ruby to Val, dez, and that the rest of the money he !, received was to pay his living expens, es and the expenses of his trip to, Providence, Rhode Island, where he, went to see Church, the undertaker, that prepared Jones\' body for bur, ial., He also testified that he had said at, the coroner\'s inquest that the men, were very close together at the time, of the shooting because there were, powder burns on Jones\' body near the, wounds., A letter from L. R. Gillettee, assist, ant district attorneyl for the 4th divis, ion, to Moore, in which the latter was, urged to make a strong, affidavit that, would make a showing upon which, MacDonald could be extradited, was, introduced in evidence, by agreement j, of counsel., Hospital Helper Corroborates., John Luddens, of Juneau, who was, an assistant about the hospital, cor, roborated the testimony of Dr. Moore, as to the powder burns. He also said, that the wounds were inflicted from, the front rather than the rear., The cross examination of Luddens, was directed particularly to his exper, ience with gunshots, and his memory., He said that the powder burns about, the wounds on Jones extended for, probably an inch from them, and that, the burns kere mostly on the lower, side of the side and chest wounds. He, also said that the clothes were, burned., Undertaker Also Corroborates., A. N. Church, who had charge of, the undertaking department of C. W., Young Company, testified that he j, cared for the remains of N. C. Jones,, and that he took particular notice of, the wounds, and that they were all, powder-burned, the one that entered, just above the hip being worse !, than the others. He said that he had, closed the wounds with absorbant cot, ton, and stitched them. He said the, bones of the arms were not broken., The cross examination was directed, to testing the memory of the witness, and his experience as an undertaker., He admitted that he expected that his, expenses would be paid and that he, would be "made whole" on account, of leaving his business. He said that, he has received to date $250, and that, he came from Providence, Rhode Isl, and, where he has, since leaving Ju- 1, neau, been engaged in the real estate, business., Counsel Clash Over Admission of Tes, timony., District Attorney John Rustgard and, Senator S. H. Piles clashed yesterday, afternoon over the introduction of the, testimony of Tony A. Tubbs, who was, here as a witness for the government, before the grand jury and whose name, endorsed on the indictment as a gov, ernment witness. The defense proved, that he had been paid off by the gov, ernment and provided with funds to, carry him back to Chicago, where he, came from. Senator Piles then asked, that Tubbs\' testimony given at the, coroner\'s inquest be introduced in ev- 1, idence. He said that the defense had, a right to have this man\'s testimony,, as it had been proved that he was an, eye-witness to the shooting, and saw, the struggle between the men. He ac, cused the prosecution of trying to sup, press his testimony. He said that the, defense had the right to presume that, the man would be here to testify be, cause his name was endorsed on the, indictment, and that now the only way, that it could be secured was to intro, duce the testimony of the man as it, was sworn to at the coroner\'s inquest., RAY MATHEWS WAS |, DROWNED TODAY, ? o? o ?, Hay Mathews was drowned about, 2:30 o\'clock this morniug in the wa, ters of Gastineau chaneul through ac, cidentally falling from a small row., boat. At the time of the acciednt he, was returning from Douglas in com, pany with a man named Hennesy., They had neared shore and were pick, ing their way to the beach near the, home opposite the Worthen mills., While passing under the mill dock, Mathews was pushing on a pile with, his ore. The ore slipped and Hath, ews went overboard. Hennesy at, tempted to resdtle his companion and, he also went overboard. Hennesy, found his way to shore and notified, John Mathews, the brother of the, drowned man and the body was recov, ered soon after. The water was only, ten feet deep., The drowned man was but 22 years, of age and had been here only three, months, coming from their home in, San Jose and a mother is now living., His brother John Mathews with whom, he lived has been in Juneau over a, year. Both boys are working men., o ? o ? o, STILL NO QUORUM, TO DO BUSINESS, The City Council met last night pur- j, suant to the adjourned meeting of last, Friday night, but the same predica, ment confronted the body as on the, regular meeting night ? there was not, a quorum present. There has been so, much business of extreme urgency on, the par of members concerning their, own private matters that attendance, was impossible ? some of the body be, ing called out of town. Last night\'s, meeting adjourned subject to the call, of Mayor Carter, which call will un, doubtedly be issued as soon as a quor, um can be gotten together. ,, There is much business of import, ance now pending, some of it is ready, for action now and some of it will re- (, quire more time. There is a building, oardinance pending, also an ordinance, providing plumbing and sewerage, regulations. J i, There is also the matter of holding, a joint session with the school board ,, for the purpose of letting the contract ,, for the erection of the new school, building. This is one of the -things, that will receive prompt and speedy, action. | 1, There is a committee report due on, the matter of a central fire alarm sys, tem. This will also undoubtedly re, ceive prompt attention. ,, There is a committee report due on ,, the petition for a waterfront street, from the Pacific Coast dock along the, tideflats to the site of the electric light, plant just beyond Auk village. Re, cently there has been so much talk, of extending the thoroughfare along, the waterfront to Franklin street near, the City dock that some of the mem, bers of the council think the original, plan may be modified so as to pro, vide a more extended improvement., o ? o ? o, CASSA EL CARO? THE, NEW HOME OF J. B. CARO, ? o-o ?, One of the most comfortable homes, in Alaska is the new residence erect, ed on the country estate of Jules B., Caro, facing the Salmon creek govern, ment road near the Burridge home, stead.

Some of the trees have been, left standing, affording both beauty, and usefulness to the place., The house was designed and the, grounds planned by Mrs. Caro., o ? o ? o, Isa Goldstein returned on the North, western this morning from a short, visit in Seattle., District Attorney Rustgard accused ;, Senator Piles of making this speech, for the effect that it would have on, the jury, and characterized the action, as that of a shyster lawyer, and unbe- 1, coming a man that had been a United !, States Senator., Senator Piles resented the accusa, tion, and said that this was the first, time in all his experience that a Unit, ed States District attorne y had at, tempted to suppress testimony., Judge Brown called both men to or, der and made them sit down. Their, beligerence had created quite a com, motion in the court room, Late last night the court heard ar, guments upon the offer to put in the, evidence of Tubbs, and decided that it, was not permieable., New Strike Is on, Chisana River, The cablegrams received by The Em, pire late yesterday from Cordova, via, Seattle, confirming the news of a gold, strike, said in the dispatch to have i, been made on the Susitna, probabb, had refernce to the Chisana or Su- 1, shana, a tributary of the Tanana river, I, coming in from the Wrangell moun, tains at the south of the Tanana. A, strike was made there some months, ago, and there have been several par, ties to go to the new fields from Fair- 1, banks in polling boats., The Empire has had several arti, cles concerning this strike. The Chis, ana can be reached by way of Cor, dova, as its headwaters are about 75, miles from the interior terminus of, the Topper River & Northwestern rail, road., The Cordova dispatch in The Em, pire said that they were taking out I, gold at the rate of from $5 a pan i, downwards.

The, Juneau Pirates and the C. W. Young, Tigers will play a practice game on the, Juneau grounds tonight, and tomorrow, night one of the series of ten games j, with Douglas-Treadwell wf\'l be played, on the same grounds.

TROY, Editor., Telephone No. 3-7-4, Entered as second-class matter November 7, 1912 at the postoffice at Ju, neau. Alaska, under the Act of March 3, 1879., ALASKANS are a patient people. They have learned it in the, school of adversity. Experience has taught them that if, they expect nothing they will not be disappointed. But, we, are told that at times patience ceases to be a virtue, and with, this in mind we shall again revert to the break in the military, cable near Cape Fanshaw, which orcurred eighteen days ago., Several days thereafter the United States signal corps, the, branch of the United States army which directs the operation of, cables and land lines in Alaska, dispatched a slow, freight craft,, miscalled the "Rapid Transit," to make the necessary repairs, to the cable. It is stated that this antiquated vessel can make,, under favorable circumstances, of wind, tides and weather, some, three knots an hour, but we believe that the steamer is not, capable of making that rate of speed, except perhaps by a spurt., Any fair-to-middling windjammer would distance her in a calm., The old tub, too, has met with misfortune, but that was to be, expected; and someone must have jobbed the signal corps when, the Rapid Transit was chartered as a cable repair ship. If it, were not so serious a matter for so many people, who daily make, use of the cable service, it would be to laught because of the, joke that has been played on the cable officials., It has been pointed out several times that there is a cable, repair ship called the Burnside, the maintenance of which is, charged to the Alaska cable and military telegraph lines. But, this ship seems to need repairs as frequently as the cables, which, she is supposed to repair. Her case seems to be chronic. When, needed she is out of commission, hence the chartering of the an, cient Rapid Transit. In the meantime business interests of Ju, neau and this section suffer through what can be nothing else, than crass indifference or gross negligence, or both, of the Unit, ed States signal corps with headquarters in Seattle., In the meantime the people who suffer must contain their, souls with as much patience as they can command, trusting to, time and tide and the convenience of the signal corps with the, help of the Rapid Transit to repair a cable break that should have, been completed within a week after it was reported., "Patience, and shuffle the cards.", A riot aided and abetted, if not originated, by sailors of the, United States Navy and soldiers of the United States Army,, could not have been a gratifying spectacle during the visit to, Seattle of Secretary of the Navy Daniels., SUBSCRIPTION RATES:, Q?e year, by mail . ., Six months, by mail ., Per month, delivered, $10.00 I, 6.00, 1.00, AN UNPARDONABLE DELAY, TRYING A NEW PLAN, AN EMBASSY of peace to the 169 Indian tribes of the United, States is an interesting event that seems to have escaped, the publicity which it deserves. This peaceful embassy, started on June 9, last, on an itinerary covering 22,042 miles, and, is scheduled to return to Washington on Dec. 9. This "expedi, tion of citizenship" will visit eighty-nine Indian reservations and, at each will hold patriotic ceremonies. The idea is to reach, practically all the men of the tribes, arouse their patriotism and, and get them to express the same sentiments of patriotism as, those which have been heard from Indian chiefs heretofore at, various assemblages of these aboriginal peoples., In carrying into effect this idea the latest appliances of civ, ilization will be brought into use, President Wilson\'s voice being, heard through the great trumpet of the phonograph, greeting, the Indians no longer as the children of the great White Father, at Washington, but as brothers called upon to march side by side, with the palefaces to a common destiny., The Indian has too long been left to the dealings of agents, and bureaus. It is well to try to get him to take a personal in, terest in the Nation with which the fortunes of his race are in, terwoven., USELESS PROTRACTED ORATORY., THE United States Senate is in for a deluge of oratory, and, while it is being unloaded the passage of the tariff law must, wait. Presidential candidates, and near-Presidential can, didates will deliver weighty utterances for selfish purposes. The, Congressional Record will be loaded down with rhetoric and the, flowers of poesy will be culled in passing. But the talk of these, gentlemen will be useless. No new party can be built up and, no old party can be reconstructed by anything that they may, now say on schedules and percentages or on tariff commissions, and reciprocal treaties. Their speech-making will give nobody, the Presidential nomination three years hence. It will not even, prevent the ultimate passage of the pending bill, but protracted, oratory will lead to more protracted oratory from others who are, not Presidential aspirants, but whose devotion to the gluttons, who profit by tariff extortion is just as sincere as ever it was., ALASKA OWES, DEBT TO STUCK, Hardly a finer tribute could have, been paid Archdeacon Stuck and his, companions in the conquest of Mount, McKinley than the manner in which, the news of their successful ascent, was received by their fellow-towns, men yesterday. There was unanimous, rejoicing, but no trace of surprise, j, It was not that the people of Fair, banks hold lightly the dangers . and, the difficulties of the ascent of a moun, tain like McKinley. It meant that the, people of Fairbanks felt confident all, along that if it was physically possi, ble for human beings to ascend the, mountain to its summit, Archdeacon, Stuck and his associates would suc, ceed in the undertaking., To Archdeacon Stuck and his par, ty, who placed the cross upon one sum, mit of the great mountain, and to the, Taylor-Anderson party, who planted, the Stars and Stripes upon the other, summit, the people of the Tanana and, of all Alaska owe a real debt. After, all the attacks upon the summits of, McKinley by expert mountain climb, ers from the Outside, it has remained, for true Alaskans to clinch the hazard, and to win. They have shown the, world that we have here the stuff of, which Pearys, Scotts and Amundsens, are made. In the renown which the, world will accord them for their cour, age, hardihood and relf-reliance, in, the tributes to their daring nature and, their lofty spirit, we, their fellow-Alas, kans and fellow-townsmen, will be, given a share, and for this we owe, them a debt of abiding gratitude. ?, Fairbanks Times., 0?0 ? 0, Dr. Herbert Davis is making the, round trip to Seward and return on, the Northwestern., E.

L. ANDREWS NOTES, CHANGES ON MUIR, C. L. Andrews returned Saturday, from Glacier bay, where he had gone, to get photographic views and other, interesting data for publication. His, trip was very successful. He reports, some remarkable changes since his, last visit to the great \\luir glacier., Speaking of his trip Mr. Andrews, said: "The trip to Muir glacier was es, pecially interesting on account of the, changes that have been going on dur, ing the past twenty years. I visited it, in 1892 when the face of the glacier, was nearly opposite the cabin built, by Prof. H. F. Reid, of John Hopkins, University in 1891, for the purpose, studying the big ice pile and to make, a map of it. Again in 1903 I visited, the glacier and observed the change, made by the earthquake of 1899. The, rapid withdrawal of ice at this time, was considered abnormal and unusual., "To find at this time that the, changes since 1903, a period of ten, years, have been still greater, is even, more striking. Not only has the ice, face receded between eight and nine, miles in twenty years, but the sur, face has settled and melted away, over an area of more than 100 square, miles to the extent of 100 to 600 feet., The amount of ice that has disappeared, from the front of the glacier is im, mense being an area of two miles in, width by between eight and nine miles, in length and at least an average of, 600 feet in depth. This is likely over, one-half the average thickness that has, gone, for the front in 1891 was about, 200 feet above sea level. The ice ex, ended below sea level probably 400, feet. The surface rose rapidly and in, 1903 the ice was about where the 600, foot contour line of Prof. Reid was lo, cated on his map of 1891, shown in the, geological survey of that year., "This shows the whole surface has, settled over 400 feet. This would at, the evidently underestimated thick, ness of 600 feet give the enormous, amount of 310,000,000 cubic feet of, ice that has melted away within the, past 20 years which is little less, than half the whole 300 square miles, cinstituting the surface of the glacier, in 1891. The heat required to melt, this ice would in itself make an ap, preciable change in the basin of the, glacier.
