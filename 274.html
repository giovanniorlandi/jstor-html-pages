In this context, the Euro Summit did not acknowledge the\nproposal of the European Commission to transform the ESM into the European Monetary Fund (EMF),\nbut simply gave the Eurogroup a mandate to draft the relevant amendments to the ESM Treaty and submit\nthem to the European Council of June 2019. Nonetheless, the justifications for the incorporation of the\nESM into the body of the European Treaties continue to be valid and may come back into play. In this\nrespect, it is worth highlighting two flaws that have emerged in the proposed transformation of the ESM\ninto the EMF. First, the ESM Treaty does not contain any rule about extinction and transfer of functions.\nSecond, the Commission’s proposal did not clarify what status the EMF would have enjoyed in the EU legal\nframework.\nKeywords: European Stability Mechanism; European Monetary Fund; failed transformation; international organizations;\nsuccession by absoprtion\nA. Introduction\nOn December 14, 2018, the Euro Summit endorsed the Term Sheet on the European Stability\nMechanism (ESM) reform formalized by the Eurogroup on December 4, 2018.1 The Term Sheet\nis based on four key points: (1) The ESM will provide financial assistance to the Single\nResolution Fund (SRF) in the form of a revolving credit line; (2) recourse to the\nPrecautionary Conditioned Credit Lines is possible if certain quantitative criteria are met;\n(3) ESM financial assistance is to be granted only to those countries whose debt is sustainable\nand the capacity for repayment indisputable; and (4) the ESM and the European Commission\nwill cooperate within, and outside, the financial assistance programs. The Eurogroup was\nmandated to incorporate these points in amendments to the ESM Treaty to be submitted to\nthe European Council of June 2019. In June 2019, though, the Euro Summit did not approve\nthe revised draft ESM Treaty but invited the Eurogroup to continue working so as to reach an\nagreement by the European Council of December 2019.2 In December 2019 the Euro Summit\n*Mauro Megliani is a tenured assistant professor of International Law at the Catholic University of Milan, mauro.\nmegliani@unicatt.it.\n© The Author(s), 2020.

In fact, in December 2017, the European Commission\nhad presented a proposal for an EU Council Regulation for the transformation of the ESM into the\nEMF and its incorporation in the framework of the European Treaties.4 This transformation was\nmeant to complete the European Monetary Union by providing unity, efficiency, and democratic\naccountability. From a formal point of view, the Commission proposal involved the extinction of\nthe ESM as an international organization in its own right and the establishment of the EMF as a\nnew institution within the European Treaties.\nAlthough any reference to the transformation of the ESM into the EMF was dropped out, the\nreasons for the incorporation of the ESM into the body of the European Treaties continue to be\nvalid and may come back into play. Against this background, the purpose of this Article is to\nillustrate the mechanisms of financial assistance to European countries, to delineate the proposal\nof the Commission, and to highlight the transformation of the ESM into the EMF, with specific\nreference to the forms and the methods and the results of this transformation. In this context,\nparticular attention will be given to the modalities of transformation in the absence of a specific\nprovision in the ESM Treaty and to the status the EMF would have enjoyed in the EU legal system.\nIn some way, this Article is meant to be as a benchmark for when times are ripe for a resumption\nof the EMF proposal.\nB. Financial Assistance to Euro Countries: From the No Bail-Out Rule to the ESM\nFollowing the coming into force of the monetary union, the Euro countries were no longer entitled\nto receive financial assistance under the scheme of the balance of payments facility (Article 143\nTFEU).5 This lacuna derived from the deliberate choice of the drafters of the Maastricht Treaty to\nleave to the financial markets the task of imposing the fiscal discipline on borrowing states.6 In the\nlong term, the assumption on which this choice was based turned out to be wrong.\nIn May 2010, Greece was on the verge of a financial crisis because it was not able to refinance its\npublic debt by issuing new bonds on the markets. As a default on the Greek debt would have\nendangered the single currency, the Euro countries arranged a mechanism for financial assistance\nto Greece in the form of a pool of bilateral loans.7 This ad hoc facility was followed in June 2010 by\nthe establishment of a semi-permanent mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility\n(EFSF), that was constituted in the form of a corporation (société anonyme) registered in\nLuxembourg and subject to the laws of Luxembourg.8 This mechanism was aimed at preserving\nthe financial stability of the monetary union by providing temporary assistance to Euro countries\n3See generallyMauroMegliani, The European Stability Mechanism Reform and the Single-Limb Collective Action Clauses, 32\nEUR.

In a first document—the Intercreditor Agreement—the Euro countries committed themselves to providing\neighty billion Euros to Greece. In a second document—the Loan Facility Agreement—the Euro countries formalized\nthe terms of the loan with Greece, the provision of which was conditional upon the compliance of a specific memorandum of\neconomic policy.\n8The Company was agreed on by the—then—sixteen Euro countries on May 9, 2010, and incorporated under\nLuxembourgish law on June 7, 2010; the Statute is on file with the author.\nGerman Law Journal 675\n', 'experiencing financial difficulties on the basis of a memorandum of economic policy.9 The\nEFSF was not meant to be permanent: Its establishing instrument stipulated that no loan facility\nagreement would be granted after June 30, 2013 (Article 4).\nTo fill this lacuna, the European Council of March 24–25, 2011, resolved to add a new\nparagraph to Article 136 TFEU, under which the Member States whose currency was the Euro\nwere allowed to establish a stability mechanism to be activated to safeguard the financial stability\nof the Euro area as a whole.10 The stability mechanism was formalized in a treaty establishing the\nESM.11 The first version was signed in Brussels on July 11, 2011, with the second and definitive\nversion signed in Brussels on February 1, 2012.12 The purpose of the ESM is to mobilize funding\nand provide stability support, under strict policy conditionality, in favor of the ESM Members\nStates who are experiencing, or are threatened by, severe financing problems, as far as this\nintervention is indispensable for the preservation of the financial stability of the whole Euro area\nand of its Member States (Article 3).\nThe ESM is structured as follows: A Board of Governors, composed of a Governor for each\nMember State in the person of the member of the national government responsible for finance\n(Article 5(1)); a Board of Directors, composed of a person appointed by each Governor among\npersons of high competence in economic and financial matters, who are revocable at any time\n(Article 6(1)); and, finally, a Managing Director, appointed by the Board of Governors\n(Article 7(1)). The President of the Euro Group may attend the meetings of the Board of\nGovernors as an observer, together with the President of the ECB and the Commissioner for\nEconomic and Monetary Affairs (Article 5(3)). Representatives of non-Euro countries taking part\nin financial assistance operations in favor of an ESMmember may be invited to attend the relevant\nmeetings as observers; in addition, representatives of the IMF or other organizations and\ninstitutions may occasionally be invited to attend meetings as observers (Articles 5(4), 5(5)).\nFrom an institutional standpoint, the ESM amounts to a new international organization\ndesigned to operate alongside the EU. The failure to incorporate such a body within the framework\nof the European Treaties reflects the tendency by the Euro countries to Flucht in Völkerrecht\n(flight to international law) as a substitute for EU action.13 In effect, EU law does not prevent\nMember States from concluding agreements between themselves,14 even though this involves a\nform of differential integration.15 The legality of the establishment of the ESM was challenged\n9SeeMauroMegliani, Verso una Nuova Architettura Finanziaria Europea: Un Percorso Accidentato, 27 DIR.

(L 91) 1.\nThe amendment to the TFEU was made through the simplified procedure envisaged in Article 48(6) TEU, namely, without the\ncall for a convention, but with the respect of the constitutional rules of the Member States, whose unanimity is expressed\nwithin the European Council. The route taken was not to create the mechanism within the framework of the Treaties under\nArticle 352 TFEU, as according to the Lisbon Judgment (decision of the Bundesverfassungsgericht [BVerfG] [Federal\nConstitutional Court] June 30, 2009, 2 ENTSCHEIDUNGEN DES BUNDESVERFASSUNGSGERICHTS [BVERFGE] 2/08, para. 328,\nhttp://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/es20090630_2bve000208en.html) as a step like that would have required the previous\nassent of the German Parliament.\n11See Matthias Ruffert, The European Debt Crisis and European Union Law, 48 COMMON MKT.

The ECJ dismissed the argument, ruling that the provisions of the TFEU in the\ndomain of economic policy do not confer any specific power upon the EU institutions to establish\nsuch a mechanism (paragraph 64).17 Further, under Article 352 TFEU—the so-called flexibility\nclause—the EU institutions are not obliged to act, but are simply enabled to do so (paragraph.\n67).18 Thereby, Member States were entitled to conclude the ESM agreement (paragraph 68), even\nthough in doing so they were called upon to comply with EU law19 and to subject the provision of\nresources to conditionality (paragraph 69).20\nC. From the ESM to the EMF\nIn December 2017, the European Commission submitted a proposal to the EU Council to\ntransform the ESM into the EMF and to incorporate it into the EU legal framework. The\nCommission justified this step with reference to the necessity to further strengthen the ESM\ninstitutional anchoring—particularly in terms of transparency, judicial review, and the efficiency\nof the EU’s financial resources—thus offering better support to Member States. Such a step\nwould have improved cooperation with the Commission and accountability to the European\nParliament.21\nThe Commission proposal was grounded on Article 352 TFEU. Under this norm, when an EU\naction should prove necessary within the framework of the policies of the Treaties to achieve one\nof the objectives indicated in the Treaties, but the Treaties have not provided the necessary\npowers, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after obtaining\nthe consent of the European Parliament, shall adopt the appropriate measures. All these requirements\nare cumulatively satisfied in relation to the Commission’s proposal. In terms of necessary\npowers, the ECJ in the Pringle case has clearly ruled that the Treaties do not confer any specific\npower on the European Union to establish a stability mechanism of the kind of the ESM.22\nIn terms of the objectives of the Treaties, the ECJ in the Pringle case also emphasized that maintaining\nthe financial stability of the monetary union is one of the highest objectives of the EU, and\nthat, under exceptional circumstances, providing financial assistance under strict conditionality is\ninstrumental to pursuing this objective.23 In terms of necessary action, the action by the EU\nCouncil is essential to bring the management of the conditionality on which financial assistance\nis subordinated from an intergovernmental level to a proper EU domain.24 In this way, the\n16See generally ECJ, Case C-370/12, Pringle v.

INPS, ECLI:EU:C:2002:16, Judgment of 15 Jan. 2002 at para. 32.\n20The reference to conditionality contained in Article 13(3) of the ESM Treaty is a sort of consistency clause, which ensures\nthe compatability with the measures of economic coordination under the TFEU. In this respect, it is an expression of\nthe principle of loyal cooperation and the primacy of EU Law.

PAPERS 511, 531 (2018).\nGerman Law Journal 677\n', 'provision of financial assistance becomes justiciable before the ECJ and accountable to the\nEuropean Parliament and national parliaments.\nThe proposal of the Commission is not altogether surprising. The ECB, in its opinion on the\ndraft European Council decision amending Article 136 TFEU with regard to a stability mechanism\nfor countries whose currency is the Euro, had emphasized the opportunity that at an appropriate\nmoment the ESM would become an EU mechanism.25 The debate over the establishment of the\nESM was also accompanied by proposals for the creation of a proper EMF26 or a European\nMechanism for Sovereign Debt Crisis Resolution.27\nFrom a substantive point of view, the proposal of the Commission contained significant\ninnovations in comparison with the ESM Treaty. First, the EMF would contribute to safeguarding\nthe financial stability of the Euro area and the financial stability of the participating Member\nStates, whereas the present ESM Treaty speaks only of intervention indispensable to safeguard\nthe financial stability of the Euro area as a whole and of its Member States. The deletion of\nthe reference to the “whole” Euro area would allow an intervention in the absence of a systemic\ncrisis endangering the whole Euro-zone, but in the presence of a crisis affecting a specific Euro\ncountry.28 Second, the EMF would be accountable to the European Parliament and Council for the\nexecution of its tasks. In connection with this, the EMF would be required to submit to the\nCommission, the Council, and the European Parliament an annual report on its activity.\nMoreover, the European Parliament could ask questions of the EMF Managing Director who\nwould be obliged to answer orally or in writing. As a corollary to the incorporation of the\nESM in the EU legal order, the EMF acts must be consistent with the EU Treaties and the EU\nCharter of Fundamental Rights, and could be challenged before the ECJ.29 Third, the EMF would\n25See Opinion of the European Central Bank, CON/2011/24, point 8 (Mar. 17, 2011).\n26See generallyDaniel Gros & ThomasMayer,How to Deal with Sovereign Default in Europe: Create the EuropeanMonetary\nFund Now!, CEPS Policy Brief No. 202 (May 17, 2010), available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1610303 The proposal\nwas to be adopted within a framework of enhanced cooperation between the Euro-zone countries. The participating countries\nwould have provided financial contributions, based on a percentage of both excessive deficit and debt with respect to the\nMaastricht parameters, as these constitute a warning sign of imminent insolvency or a liquidity crisis. Those contributions\nwould be invested in investment-grade government debt of Euro countries. In the case of necessity, any participating country\ncould call on the funds, up to the concurrence of the amount deposited, provided that its adjustment program had received\napproval by the Eurogroup. Any further drawing of funds would be permitted solely in the presence of an adjustment program\nsupervised by the Commission and the Eurogroup.\n27See generally François Gianviti et al., A European Mechanism for Sovereign Debt Crisis Resolution: A Proposal, Bruegel\nBlueprint (Nov. 9, 2010), http://aei.pitt.edu/15123/1/101109_BP_Debt_resolution_BP_clean_01.pdf. The European\nMechanism would have been based upon two cornerstones: First, a procedure—to be administered by the EU Court of\nJustice—for negotiation between a sovereign borrower burdened with unsustainable debt and its private creditors, with the view\nto achieving an agreed solution to make debt sustainable; second, a mechanism for providing insolvent countries with financial\nassistance to be granted against an agreement between debtors and creditors capable of re-establishing the borrower’s solvency.\n28See generallyMichael Ioannidis, Towards a European Monetary Fund: Comments on the Commission’s Proposal, EU LAW\nANALYSIS (Jan. 31, 2018), http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/2018/01/towards-european-monetary-fund-comments.html\n(the focus would have shifted on the Member States).\n29See Pennesi, supra note 24, at 539–41 In this way, the divergent rulings delivered by the ECJ in Florescu, Mallis, and Ledra\nwould be reconciled. In Florescu, the ECJ ruled that the Memoranda of Understanding signed by the Commission and the\nRomanian authorities in the framework of the assistance programme under Regulation 332/2002, supra note 5, was an act\ngrounded on EU law the legality of which was challengeable before the ECJ (ECJ, Case C-258/14, Florescu et al. v. Sibiu et al.,\nECLI:EU:C:2017:448, Judgment of 13 June 2017). In Mallis, the ECJ ruled that, although the Eurogroup endorsed the conditionality\nrelated to the bail-in of the Cypriot banking system approved by the ESM Board of Governors, this endorsement\ncould not constitute basis for annulment, because the Eurogroup was an informal body and not a EU institution, and its acts\nwere not binding but merely possessed an informative nature (ECJ, Joined Cases C-105–109/15 P, Mallis et al. v. Comm’n &\nECB, ECLI:EU:C:2016:702, Judgment of 20 Sep. 2016). In Ledra, the ECJ restated that the concession of assistance to Cyprus\nby the ESM was an international act beyond the domain of EU law, but it contextually underscored that in this process the\nCommission has the task of ensuring the consistency of the ESM decision with EU law. This may imply an action for damages,\neven though the burden of proof is very high (ECJ, Joined Cases C-8–10/15, Ledra Advert. Ltd. et al. v. Comm’n & ECB, ECLI:\nEU:C:2016:701, judgment of 20 Sep. 2016).\n678 Mauro Megliani\n', 'operate in favor of the banking system in two ways: A direct recapitalization of credit institutions\nand credit lines or guarantees in favor of the Single Resolution Board (SRB).30 The assistance to\ncredit institutions would take place when an EMF Member State had been affected by severe\ndifficulties with its banking sector, which could not be cured without significantly endangering\nits fiscal sustainability, because there would be a risk of contagion from banks to states or\nalternative routes would have the effect of endangering market access.31 The assistance to the\nSRB would be provided jointly with the participating states—namely, those non-Euro countries\nthat have decided to establish a close cooperation with the ECB in the field of prudential supervision\nof financial institutions. The financial terms and conditions of this assistance would be\nincorporated in a financial assistance agreement to be concluded by the EMF and the participating\nstates with the SRB.32\nD. The Transformation of the ESM\nArticle 2 of the proposal of Council Regulation provided scant indications relating to the transformation\nof the ESM. This norm stipulated that the EMF shall succeed to and replace the ESM\nin its legal positions and assume all its rights and obligations. This process should have been\ncompleted upon the entry into force of the Regulation or the consent of the ESM. This vagueness\nwas because the ESM Treaty does not contain any rule dealing with this phenomenon. Thereby,\nthe whole process was in the hands of the ESM Member States. It was their competence, as\nHerren der Veträge (Masters of the Treaty), to extinguish the ESM and to transfer its functions\nto the EMF on the basis of the general rules governing the succession between international\norganizations.\nBroadly speaking, the phenomenon of succession between international organizations\npresents significant differences in comparison with that of state succession. This is because\nan international organization does not possess the whole rights and duties of a State, but only\nthose rights and duties related to the purposes and functions arising under the establishing treaty\nand the relevant practice.33 Because the rights and obligations of an international organization\nare connected with its functions, the succession between international organizations consists of\nthe transfer of functions from one organization to another.34 In the context of the EMF succession\nto the ESM, three profiles come into play: The forms of transformation, the methods of\ntransformation, and the results of transformation.\n30See generally Council Regulation 1024/2013 of Oct. 15, 2013, Conferring Specific Tasks on the European Central Bank\nConcerning Policies Relating to the Prudential Supervision of Credit Institutions, 2013 O.J. (L 287) 63 (EC). The SRB is an EU\nagency entrusted with the task of ensuring the effective and consistent functioning of the Single ResolutionMechanism (SRM).\nSee also Danny Busch, Governance of the Single Resolution Mechanism, in EUROPEAN BANKING UNION 281 (Danny Busch &\nGuido Ferrarini eds., 2015).\n31The credit institutions which would benefit from this recapitalization must be of systemic relevance or must pose a serious\nthreat to the financial stability of the Euro area or the requesting state. In any case, the requesting state must contribute to the\nrecapitalization. This possibility has been already envisaged in ESM Board of Governors Resolution of 8 December 2014 concerning\nthe establishment of the instrument of the direct recapitalization of institutions (DRI) and lately incorporated in the EMF\nTreaty.

MYERS, THE SUCCESSION BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 11–12 (1993).\nGerman Law Journal 679\n', 'I. The Forms of Transformation\nThe issue of the succession between international organizations became topical following\nthe Second World War when the United Nations and a number of other international organizations—such\nas the Food and Agricultural Organization, the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the World Health Organization, and the World\nMeteorological Organization—were established and operated in the same fields as pre-existing\ninternational organizations.35 From this practice it is possible to establish five forms of succession:\n(1) Replacement, when an organization is replaced by a new one with basically the same functions;\n(2) absorption, when a functionally limited organization is absorbed by a broader organization\nand becomes one of its organs; (3) merger, when two or more organization are combined to form\na new one; (4) separation, when a subsidiary organ of an existing organization is separated from its\nparent institution to form a new organization; and (5) transfer of specific functions, when some\nfunctions of an organization are transferred to another.36\nAgainst this background, the transformation of the ESM into the EMF can be subsumed\nunder the category of absorption. In effect, the ESM was to be dissolved and its functions and\nresponsibilities were to be reconstituted in the EMF, which was designed as an organ of the\nEU.37 The practice of international organizations records at least two instances of absorption.\nIn 1969, the International Bureau of Education (IBE) was absorbed into the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The IBE was established in\n1926 as a private organization and subsequently was transformed in an intergovernmental\norganization operating as an information center for matters concerned with education.\nBecause of financial difficulties, in 1969 it was dissolved and became a subsidiary organ of the\nUNESCO.38 In 1978, the International Patent Institute (IPI) was absorbed into the European\nPatent Organization (EPO). The IPI was established in 1947 as an intergovernmental organization\nwith the purpose of centralizing patent searching and archiving. In the 1973 EPO establishing\nagreement it was stipulated that assets and liabilities of the IPI were to be transferred to the\nEPO with the former becoming a branch of the latter.39\nOf the two instances mentioned above, the closest to the absorption of the ESM into the EU is\nthe absorption of the IBE into the UNESCO, as in both cases the absorbed organization has\nbecome—or was to become—a specific organ of the absorbing organization. Under the\nAgreement between the UNESCO and the IBE, the IBE transferred to the UNESCO all the\nfunctions it had performed under the 1929 Statutes,40 and it was reconstituted as an autonomous\nbody with the same name within the framework of the UNESCO.41 In this context two aspects are\nworth consideration.\nFrom an institutional point of view, the IBE governing body—the Council—is composed of\nMember States designated by the UNESCO General Conference. Moreover, the Council of the\nIBE submits a draft general program and budget to the General Conference of the UNESCO under\nwhich it defines its range of activities (Article V(a), 1968 Statutes).42 From a substantive point of\n35See Hungdah Chiu, Succession in International Organisations, 54 INT’L COMP.

See also Douglas Hodgson, International Bureau of Education MEPIL\n(2006) (under Article 3, the IBE enjoys a large and functional autonomy).\n42See 1968 Statutes, in UNESCO, Records of the General Conference Fifteenth Session: Resolutions, at 109 (Paris, 1968).\n680 Mauro Megliani\n', 'view, the IBE mandate under the 1968 Statute was enlarged in comparison with that under the\n1929 Statutes. Under the 1929 Statutes, the IBE performed two main functions: To collect\ninformation relating to public and private education, and to participatein scientific research in\nthis field by undertaking experimental and statistical research and making the results known\nto educators (Article 2, 1929 Statute).43 Under the 1968 Statute, the IBE received the tasks of:\nPreparing for—and organizing at least every two years—the sessions of the International\nConference on Public Education; undertaking educational studies particularly on comparative\neducation and publishing the results; coordinating its work with that of other institutions pursuing\nsimilar objectives; and maintaining and developing an international educational library and a\npermanent international exhibition of public education (Article II, 1968 Statutes).44\nA similar outcome can also be seen in the ESM-EMF relationship. From an institutional\npoint of view, the EMF Managing Director would no longer be appointed by the Board of\nGovernors—like in the ESM—but by the EU Council, after consultation with the European\nParliament, on the basis of a list of suitable candidates prepared by the Board of Governors\n(Article. 7, EMF Statute). Moreover, under the proposal for an EU Regulation, most of the decisions\ntaken by the Board of Governors could enter into force only following an approval by the EU\nCouncil (Article 3(1), Regulation proposal). The EMF was also requested to prepare an annual\nreport on its activities to be submitted to the European Parliament, the EU Council, and the\nCommission (Article 4, Regulation proposal), and contextually forwarded to the national parliaments\nof the EMF Member States (Article 5, Regulation proposal). From a substantive point of\nview, the most significant improvement in comparison with the ESM consists of the possibility of\nproviding financial support in the form of lines or ceilings, or both, for guarantees on the liabilities\nof the SRB (Article 22, EMF Statute).45\nII. The Methods of Transformation\nThe rules for the dissolution of an international organization are usually found in the statute\nof the organization or in a subsequent act. Generally speaking, it is quite rare for statutes of\ninternational organizations to contain the rules for their dissolution. This is because the aim\nof the founding states is not to confine the mandate of the organization to a specific time period.\nAn exception is constituted by the statutes of the international financial institutions, because in\nthis case, there are significant issues relating to the liquidation of assets and liabilities. In this\ncontext, the decision to terminate the operation is taken by a decision of the plenary organs\nin which all the Member States are represented and requires a certain voting quorum.46\nUnder the International Monetary Fund (IMF) establishing agreement, the Board of\nGovernors may liquidate the IMF by simple majority (Article XXVII(2)). Under the\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Development\nAssociation (IDA) establishing agreements, the vote of a majority of the Governors, exercising a\nmajority of the total voting power (Article VI(5)(b) IBRD, Article VII(5)(a) IDA), is required.\nUnder the statutes of the regional development banks, the Board of Governors may terminate\nthe operations of the relevant institution by a vote of two-thirds of the total number of\nGovernors, representing not less than three-fourths of the total voting power of the members\n(Article 10(2) Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) , Article 45 Asian Development\n43See Agreement, supra note 41.\n44See 1968 Statutes, supra note 42.\n45In this context, the Board of Governors should have adopted the financial terms and conditions of the EMF support. The\nManaging Director should have signed the agreement on the basis of approval by the Board of Directors and would have had\nthe authority to decide on the drawdown of the credit lines or the provision of guarantees on liabilities of the SRB. The Board\nof Directors should have adopted the detailed guidelines on the modalities for implementing EMF credit lines or guarantees to\nthe SRB (Art. 22, EMF Statute).\n46See HENRY G. SCHERMERS & NIELS M. BLOKKER, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL LAW 1049 (5th rev. ed. 2011).\nGerman Law Journal 681\n', 'Bank (ASDB), Article 41 European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The\nexception is the African Development Bank (AFDB) statute, which requires a decision by the\nBoard of Governors taken with three-fourths of the total voting power (Article 47).\nFailing specific rules on dissolution in the establishing agreement, two routes are available:\nEither amending the charter to incorporate specific rules on dissolution and transfer of functions,\nor making an international agreement providing for the dissolution and transfer of functions. In\nthe latter case, two possibilities arise. First, the Member States may stipulate an ad hoc\ninternational agreement containing rules for dissolution of the organization and transfer of functions.47\nSecond, the Member States may incorporate the norms on dissolution and liquidation in\nthe treaty establishing the new international organization that is meant to take over the functions,\nassets, and liabilities of the old one.48 This second possibility seems more suitable because the rules\non dissolution will enter into force at the same time as the establishment of the new organization.49\nPractice also records a particular instance of succession between international organizations,\nfor example, implied succession. It takes places when there are no specific measures providing for\nthe dissolution and transfer of functions, assets, and liabilities from one organization to another\norganization. The Member States simply consider that the succeeding organization has taken\nover the functions of the pre-existing organization. Technically speaking, this is a form of tacit\nabrogation of the previous treaty that generally occurs when the whole matter is governed by\nthe provisions of the new treaty.50 Such peculiar type of succession, however, may work only\nin relation to small organizations with few Member States, functions, assets, and liabilities.51\nUnlike the above mentioned international financial institutions (IMF, IBRD, IDA, IADB,\nAFDB, ASDB, EBRD), the ESM Treaty is silent about the procedures for dissolution and the possible\ntransfer of functions, assets, and liabilities. By contrast, the proposal of Council Regulation\nclearly stipulated that the EMF should have succeeded and replaced the ESM in all its legal positions,\nrights, and obligations. It further specified that this process was to be completed upon the\nentry into force of the Regulation or upon the consent of the ESM (Article 2).52 This consent,\naccording to the proposal of Council Regulation, should have been given by the ESM Board\nof Governors in its capacity of highest decision making organ composed of all the representatives\nof the ESM Member States (Whereas Number 21).53 Nevertheless, the proposal of Council\nRegulation did not consider that under the ESM Treaty, the Board of Governors is not vested\nwith the power to dissolve the organization and transfer its functions. To fill this lacuna, three\n47SeeHugo J. Hahn, Continuity in the Law of International Organizations, 11 DUKE L.

In 1975, the agreement establishing\nthe European Space Service stipulated that the conventions on the European Space Research Organization and the\nEuropean Organization for Development of Space Vehicle Launchers were terminated, and the relevant rights were taken\nover by the new organization).\n49See SCHERMERS & BLOKKER, supra note 46, at 1051.\n50See Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Belg. v. Bulg.), Preliminary Objection, 1939 P.C.I.J. Series A/B No 77,\n92 (Apr. 4) (separate opinion by Anzilotti, J.) (this principle is now acknowledged in Article 59 of the 1969 Vienna\nConvention on the Law of Treaties, under which a treaty is considered terminated if all the parties to it make a later treaty\nrelating to the same subject matter, and it appears from the later treaty—or is otherwise established—that the parties intended\nthat the matter should be governed by that treaty, or the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the\nearlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time).\n51See MYERS, supra note 34, at 42.\n52As a product of that, all states that are party to the ESM Treaty should be members of the EMF at the entry into force of\nthe Regulation (Whereas Number 22 Regulation proposal).\n53See ESM Treaty art. 5(1) (the ESM Board of Governors is composed of the ministers of finance of all the ESM Member\nStates. The prior consent of the Board of Governors reflects the fact that the ESM is an international financial institution based\non an international agreement between the Euro countries).\n682 Mauro Megliani\n', 'routes can be envisaged. First, the ESM Member States may decide to dissolve the ESM in a\nseparate treaty. In this case, the ESM Board of Governors would acknowledge and implement such\na decision in the ESM legal order. Second, the ESMMember States may amend the ESM establishing\nTreaty and empower the Board of Governors to dissolve the ESM and transfer functions and rights\nto the EMF. Third, the ESM Member States may provide their delegates in the ESM Board of\nGovernors with the specific power to dissolve the organization and transfer functions and rights\nto the EMF. In this case, the Governors would not act as members of the ESM Board, but as\nrepresentatives of Member States endowed with treaty making power—“full powers.”\nIn order to overcome all these problems, the solution could be to take the opportunity presented\nby the ESM amending process to insert into the ESM Treaty a specific norm providing\nfor dissolution and transfer of functions. Because the ESM is composed of a small number of\nMember States, and considering the exceptionality of the ESM stability support, the dissolution\nwould require the unanimity of the ESM Board of Governors. This norm might be completed by a\nprovision specifically concerning the transfer of functions to a future EMF. This may be perceived\nas a sign that the project of establishing an EMF is not completely abandoned.\nIII. The Results of Transformation\nThe outcome of this process of transformation is the extinction of the ESM as an intergovernmental\norganization in its own right and its reconstitution as a legal person of the EU. In this\ncontext, the proposal of Council Regulation clarified that the EMF would have been an EU body\nwith legal personality (Whereas Number 17). The proposed Statute further specified that the EMF\nwould have enjoyed in all the Member States the most extensive legal capacity accorded to legal\npersons under their laws. It could, in particular, acquire and dispose of movable and immovable\nproperty, and it may be a party to legal proceedings (Article 1). The conferment of the EU legal\npersonality upon the EMF, though, leaves unanswered what status it exactly would have had in the\nEU legal order.\nThe fact that Article 352 TFEU was set as the legal basis for the proposed EMF Regulation may\nsuggest that the EMF would have had a status akin to that of the European agencies.54\nNevertheless, European agencies perform informational and coordinating functions and, in some\ncases, enjoy regulatory or quasi-regulatory powers,55 like the European Banking Authority\n(EBA).56 This is an altogether different task from that of the EMF, which is mandated to mobilize\nfunding and to provide stability support in favor of the Euro countries, or their financial institutions,\nin order to preserve the financial stability of the Euro area.\nAgainst this background, a more reasonable solution might be to concoct a body akin to the\nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB). The EIB is an autonomous body within the EU legal framework\nendowed with legal personality (Article 308 TFEU).57 Its task consists of making loans and\n54See PAUL CRAIG, EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW 148–50 (2006) (in fact, nine European agencies are based upon former\nArticle 235 or Article 308, which correspond to current Article 352 TFEU). See also Sarantis-MIchail Niotis, The Birth of the\nEMF 27 (MCEL, Master Working Paper 2018/12) (the structure of the EMF would reflect the fundamental elements of an\nagency).\n55See PAUL CRAIG & GRÀINNE DE BURCA, EU LAW: TEXT, CASES AND MATERIALS 69–70 (6th ed. 2011).\n56See Regulation 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and the Council of 24 November 2010 Establishing a European\nSupervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), Amending Decision 716/2009/EC, and Repealing Commission\nDecision 2009/78/EC, 2010 O.J. (L 331) 12 (EC) (the EBA is a EU regulatory agency that was established in 2011 with\nthe mandate to conduct stress tests on European banks, increase transparency in the European financial system, and identify\nweaknesses in banks’ capital structures).\n57See ECJ, Case C-85/86, Comm’n v. EIB, ECLI:EU:C:1988:110, Judgment of 3 Mar. 1988 at para. 29 (however, its\noperational and institutional autonomy does not imply that the EIB is separated from the EU and independent from EU\nrules). This point was subsequently restated in ECJ, Case C-11/00, Comm’n v. ECB, ECLI:EU:C:2003:395, Judgment of 10\nJuly 2003 at para. 135, with specific reference to the ECB (the ECB independence “does not have the consequence of separating\nit entirely from the European Community and exempting it from every rule of Community law”).\nGerman Law Journal 683\n', 'guarantees aimed at contributing to the balanced and steady development of the internal market\nin the interests of the European Union (Article 309 TFEU).58 Membership is reserved to EU\nMember States, and voting power is correlated with quota of capital statutorily subscribed. In this\ncontext, it is worth emphasizing that the structure of the EMF closely resembles that of the EIB. In\nboth cases, there is a Board of Governors composed of Member States’ ministers (Article 7 EIB\nStatute, Article 5 EMF Statute) and a Board of Directors appointed by the Board of Governors\n(Article 9 EIB Statute, Article 6 EMF Statute).59 In the EIB, there is a Management\nCommittee (Article 11 EIB Statute), and in the EMF, there is a Managing Director (Article 7\nEMF Statute).60 Moreover, the operational task of the EMF substantively mirrors that of the\nEIB. In both cases, there is a provision of financial resources: The EIB finances its Member\nStates and their private or public undertakings, and the EMF finances Member States and their\ncredit institutions. Further, the mandate of the EMF is complementary to that of the EIB. The EIB\nundertakes the task of ensuring the harmonious development of the internal market (Article 309\nTFEU), while the EMF pursues the goal of safeguarding the financial stability of the Euro area and\nits Member States (Article 3 EMF Statute). Moreover, both the EIB and the EMF operate as a sort\nof lender of last resort: The EIB concedes financing as far as resources are not available elsewhere\non reasonable terms (Article 16, EIB Statute), while the EMF arranges financial assistance in favor\nof its Member States which are experiencing, or are threatened by, severe financing problems\n(Article 3 EMF Statute). Finally, both the EIB and the EMF are enabled to cooperate with\ninternational institutions operating in their fields of activity (Article 14 EIB Statute, Article 41\nEMF Statute).\nSuch a solution, however, would require a different legal basis: Not so much Article 352\nTFEU,61 but rather a treaty-amending procedure. Under the simplified revision machinery\nenvisaged at paragraph 6 of Article 48 TEU, the Commission is enabled to make a proposal\nof revision of part III of the TFEU relating to EU policies and actions. The European Council\nmight acknowledge this proposal and, acting unanimously, may adopt a decision amending\nthe relevant part of the TFEU that shall enter into force only following the fulfilment of\nMember States’ respective constitutional requirements.62 In this respect, it is worth considering\nthat in the Pringle case, the ECJ ruled that the provision of financial assistance by the ESM falls in\nthe purview of economic policy—namely, in the third part of the TFEU63—and does not confer\nany new competence upon the EU.64 Thereby, the procedure envisaged by Article 48(6) could be\nperfectly resorted to in this case. In this context, a new provision could be added to Article 136\nTFEU stipulating the establishment of the EMF and clarifying whether Article 136(3), which has\nallowed Euro countries to create the ESM, is superseded.\nE. Conclusion\nThe proposal for the establishment of an EMF submitted by the European Commission in\nDecember 2017 deserved a better outcome. It was driven by the sensible purpose of making\n58See generallyD.R.R. Dunnett, The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: A Legal Survey, 28 COMMONMKT.\nL. REV. 571 (1991) and Giovannagelo Marchegiani, La Banque Européenne d’investissement, in COMMENTAIRE J. MEGRET\n429–558 (2d ed. 2000).\n59In terms of Board of Directors, a significant difference between the EIB and the EMF is that in the first case, the\nCommission appoints a voting member, while in the other, the Commission appoints a non-voting member. Another difference\nis that the EIB Directors are responsible only to the EIB.\n60This quantitative difference in the composition of the managing organ is because the EIB operates on continuous basis,\nwhile the EMF operates under exceptional circumstances.\n61Cf. supra Part C.\n62Cf. Council Decision 2011/199, supra note 10.\n63See Pringle, Case C-370/12 at paras. 63, 70.\n64See id. at paras. 73, 75.\n684 Mauro Megliani\n', 'the acts of the ESM: On the one hand, accountable to the Commission, Council, and European\nParliament, and on the other hand challengeable before the ECJ. Further, the design of bringing\nthe stability mechanism under the umbrella of the European Union would have marked a change\nof pace in the intergovernmental approach that so far has characterized the management of the\nfinancial crisis of the Euro countries. All this has not occurred, and the substantive innovations\ncontained in the Commission’s proposal are to be incorporated in the ESM Treaty by virtue of an\namending process. This implies that the intergovernmental nature of the stability support is\npreserved.\nNevertheless, the idea of an EMF has not perished; it is like an underground stream and can\nsurface again. In this vein, it is necessary to highlight two flaws that have emerged in the analysis of\nthe proposed transformation of the ESM. The first flaw concerns the lack of any rule on succession\nin the ESM Treaty. This lacuna may be cured by inserting into the ESM Treaty amending process a\nspecific norm providing for the dissolution and liquidation of the ESM and, possibly, the transfer\nof functions to the EMF when it comes into being. In this way, the ESM amended Treaty may\ncontain an implied pledge to establish the EMF. The second flaw concerns the unclear status that\nthe EMF would enjoy in the EU legal framework. The choice of basing the proposal of Council\nRegulation on Article 352 TFEU could indicate that the EMF should have a status akin to that of a\nEuropean agency. Nevertheless, European agencies merely exert coordinating or regulatory\nfunctions while the EMF would provide financial assistance. A more reasonable solution would\nbe to place the EMF on the same footing as the EIB, even though this option would imply amending\nthe TFEU.\nCite this article: Megliani M (2020).
