        <pre>['Democracy Backsliding as a Danger of \nSustainable Development in the Post-Pandemic \nPeriod: Social and Legal aspects of Decision \nOleg Tkach1*, Оleh Batrymenko1, Dmytro Nelipa1, and Mykola Khylko1 \n1Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Philosophical Faculty, 01033, 60 Volodymyrska \nStreet, Kyiv, Ukraine \nAbstract. The article considers topical issues of the threat of collapse of \ndemocracy. Examples of the democracy collapse have shown the lack of \nfree and fair elections in the world, which threatens the independence of \nthe judiciary, restrictions on the right to freedom of speech, which limits \nthe ability of the political opposition to challenge the government, to \nprosecute, to offer alternatives to the regime. The collapse of democracy in \nconnection with the spread of COVID-19 is being considered, as the \ndemocratic spectrum has repeatedly resorted to excessive control, \ndiscriminatory restrictions on freedoms such as movement and assembly, \nand arbitrary or coercive coercion. Attention is drawn to the fact that the \noutbreak of coronavirus COVID-19 has led to the introduction in all \ncountries of restrictions on the rights and freedoms of the individual in \norder to prevent the spread of this infectious disease, declared a global \npandemic by the World Health Organization.  Thus, the unusual nature of \nthe COVID - 19 coronavirus pandemic poses numerous dilemmas to the \npublic, governments, parliaments, the judiciary, law enforcement and many \nother actors when it comes to the need for effective protection of health \nand, ultimately, human life, as well as adherence to and ensuring the \nfundamental democratic principles of man and society. Keywords: \ndemocracy, democratic backsliding, political regime, political crisis. \nIntroduction \nThe inconsistency of the course of postcommunist transformations with the postulates of \nthe transitological paradigm and its reflection is analyzed in the works of Valerie Bans [1], \nJuan Linz and Alfred Stepan [2]; the critique of the shortcomings of the transitological \nparadigm by Thomas Carozers was analyzed [3]. Deviations from democracy are defined in \nthe concept of "double transition" in the work of Adam Przeworski "Democracy and the \nmarket. Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America" [4], the \nconcept of "triple transition" in the work of Klaus Offe "Capitalism through a democratic \nproject? The Democratic Theory of the Triple Transition in Central and Eastern Europe \n"[5], the concept of the "Quarter Transition" in Taras Kuzio\'s "Transition in the PostCommunist\nStates: Triple or Quadruple" [6], the concept of the "fourth wave" of Michael \n \n* Corresponding author: tio19@ukr.net \n© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Data on the effects of the \npandemic on democracy were collected and systematized using the induction method. \nBased on these collected data, the results and recommendations were developed using the \ndeduction method. Thus, in particular, the systemic approach provided an opportunity to \nconsider the phenomenon of democracy as a whole and concerning the pandemic. It is due \nto a systematic approach that the relationship between the negative impact of the pandemic \non the democratic foundations of the state and society becomes logical. The institutional \napproach is used to study the structures through which the state\'s activities are aimed at \nprotecting the population from the adverse effects of the pandemic. The structuralfunctional\napproach made it possible to consider anticoronavirus policy as unquestionable \nintegrity, a system with a complex structure, each element of which has a specific purpose \nand performs specific functions aimed at combating threatening manifestations and trends. \nThe sociological approach aimed to determine the socio-political factors of the pandemic, \nthe dependence of the functioning of democracy on the impact of the pandemic, the \nconditionality of political processes, as well as the impact on democracy of other processes \ncaused by the pandemic. \nThe aim of the study is to determine the causes of the collapse of democracy in modern \nconditions, to analyze the causal links of the erosion of democracy under the influence of \nthe pandemic, as well as to find possible ways to counteract this negative phenomenon. \nDemocracy backsliding as a danger of sustainable gevelopment in the Post-Pandemic \nPeriod: social and legal aspects of decision.     \n3 Results and Discussion \nAt the same time, these scientific works mostly concern only general issues of \nprotecting the population from epidemic diseases, without considering the current legal \nregulations and the practice of preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Ukraine. And the \nproblem of destroying the foundations of democracy in terms of preventing the spread of \nCOVID-19 has not yet received adequate coverage in domestic and foreign scientific \nliterature, given the relatively recent emergence and ongoing pandemic, as well as the \nconstant review of measures against Ukraine and other countries. \nThe use by most countries of restrictions on civil rights and freedoms at the level of \nmartial law or a state of emergency has a complex dialectical nature. On the one hand, \nquarantine measures are taken for the benefit and benefit of humans - as the most effective \nmeans to reduce the occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2),\nwhich causes COVID-19 in a significant number of people. \nOn the other hand, quarantine severely restricts people\'s rights and freedoms, restricts \ntheir ability to work, earn an income and meet their basic needs. According to a group of \nAmerican and British scholars, Thieme Fetzer, Lucas Hensel, Jones Herml, and Christopher \nRoose, the measures taken "affect civil liberties, erode social capital, and cause economic \ninsecurity." \nDomestic and foreign scholars have paid attention to problematic legal issues of \nnational security in the field of health care and the protection of fundamental rights and \nfreedoms of citizens. Yes, V.M. Pashkov studied the legal characteristics and classification \nof threats in health care from the standpoint of commercial law [13]. V.V. Borsch \n3\nSHS Web of Conferences 126, 06007 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202112606007\nSDPPP-2021\n', 'considered the national health care system as a structural element of the national security of \nUkraine [14]. G.I. Rybak studied the improvement of the population\'s quality of life as a \nfactor in ensuring national security. However, Ringach drew attention to public health as a \nfactor of national security [15]. M. Feinberg, L. Niada-Avshalom and B. Toebes studied \nhuman rights in national security and public health [16]. W. Golder and G. Williams drew \nattention to human rights and national security in the fight against terrorism [17]. \n"How will the coronavirus change democracy and governance around the world?" \nUnder this name, on April 6, 2020, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace \npublished its forecast. In their study, authors Frances Z. Brown, Saskia Brechenmacher and \nThomas Carothers give a generally negative outlook for the development of democracy \naround the world. Experts note that "the pandemic arose at a time when democracy was \nalready in danger in many places, which in turn threatens to increase the backlog of \ndemocratization and authoritarian consolidation." \nAt the same time, the authors believe that in some cases, the effective response of the \nstate can strengthen confidence in the government, and the inability to hold elections can \nlead to the necessary innovations in their administration. \nSimilar to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, COVID-19\'s assessment \nof democracy\'s impact is provided by Spanish scholar Francis Amat et al. In their study, the \nresearchers describe the results of a survey conducted on March 20-28, 2020 in \nSpain. These results indicate an increase in the widespread demand of Spaniards for solid \nleadership, a willingness to renounce individual rights and freedoms and a sharp increase in \nsupport for technocratic and authoritarian rule [19, p. 24]. \nIsolation of previously unresolved issues.

Therefore, research needs \nsuch aspects as the influence of civil society on the preservation of democratic values, \ninstitutional transformation, increasing the influence of innovation forces. \nThe problem of the collapse of democracy has a special place, because there are \ntheoretical and methodological challenges: first, despite the diverse literature, there is a lack \nof theories to explain the deviation, and secondly, there are theoretical debates, for \nexample, on the causes of democratic transition, democracy consolidations that remain \nunresolved. The methodological challenge involves measuring regime change. Democratic \ndecline is accompanied by the weakening of political institutions, the process of peaceful \ntransfer of power, changes in important components of democracy, such as violations of \nrights and freedoms. \nResearcher Frances Z. Brown highlights a number of negative consequences of the \ncoronavirus pandemic for democracy, namely: Centralization of power. Illiberal leaders \nhave the opportunity to take advantage of the crisis to weaken checks and balances and \ndestroy accountability mechanisms, thereby consolidating their power. In Hungary, for \nexample, a new law allows Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to run the government \nindefinitely, without any parliamentary scrutiny. Restrictions on fundamental human rights. \nOne of the clear trends is increased control over the media under the guise of combating \n"misinformation" about the virus. The Egyptian government recently forced a reporter from \nThe Guardian to leave the country after asking about the official number of coronavirus \ncases in Egypt. Strengthened state supervision. In Israel and South Korea, governments use \nthe location of smartphones to track citizens who could potentially be carriers of the virus. \nIn Hong Kong, newcomers must wear electronic bracelets to track the whereabouts of \nindividuals. Restriction of protests. There is a risk that governments may use the current \nneed to restrict public gatherings as an excuse to combat the wave of anti-government \nprotests that have swept global politics over the past few years. For example, in Algeria, \nwhere last year\'s protests pushed the government for some political reforms, the \ngovernment banned all protests, marches and demonstrations. "Interruptions" in elections. \n4\nSHS Web of Conferences 126, 06007 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202112606007\nSDPPP-2021\n', 'considered the national health care system as a structural element of the national security of \nUkraine [14].

For example, in Algeria, \nwhere last year\'s protests pushed the government for some political reforms, the \ngovernment banned all protests, marches and demonstrations. "Interruptions" in elections. \nThe pandemic threatens to disrupt electoral processes around the world. The United States \nhas already delayed several early state-level voting, and candidates have stopped \ncampaigning. Several European countries, including Italy, northern Macedonia, Serbia, \nSpain and the United Kingdom, have postponed national or local elections. Imbalance of \ncivil-military relations. Responding to a crisis can change the balance of power between \nmilitary and civilian authorities. In many countries, from Iran and South Africa to Israel \nand Peru, the military has been called in to help counter the pandemic by stopping people \nand in other ways. Pressure on civil society. The government\'s introduction of pandemic \nemergencies is exacerbating the already significant trend of shrinking space for civil society \nin many parts of the world. Extreme restrictions on movement, information gathering and \nconfidentiality do not work in favour of civil society organizations. Resumption of the \ndiscussion "authoritarianism against democracy". The pandemic will put strong pressure \nnot only on government agencies in the most affected countries, especially health care \nsystems, but also on many other important government functions, from education and food \nsupply to law enforcement and border control. The acute public health situation, coupled \nwith insufficient government capacity, weak institutions, limited access to information and \nlow public confidence in leaders (and consequent reluctance to adhere to health directives), \nmay resume the debate on the benefits of authoritarian approaches to crisis management. \nIn contrast, a survey of Western European public opinion by French researcher Andre \nBlair points to some positive developments in citizens\' attitudes toward democratic \ninstitutions and procedures. Researchers point out that people understand the need for these \nsevere social restrictions and are willing to follow the will of the governments that have \ndecided to apply them, at least in the short term. Scholars attribute this fact to the \nprobability of citizens\' awareness of such difficult government decisions, the priority of \nwhich is the health of vulnerable people, rather than economic interests [19, p. 10-11]. \nIn general, agreeing with the researchers\' conclusions on the impact of the COVID-19 \ncoronavirus pandemic on the functioning of democratic institutions, we must note that the \npandemic is an emergency situation that requires maximum mobilization of resources of \nstates, international organizations and the public to save lives and health, which is the first \ntask of democracy. The restrictive measures taken are inherently contrary to key democratic \nideals, such as freedom, human dignity, the right to privacy, and violate the fundamental \nprinciple of the rule of law. \nIt is safe to say that the measures taken pose a potential threat to typical democratic \nprocedures, as well as to the rights and freedoms of citizens. However, whether these \nthreats will become a reality, whether they will be applied in a discriminatory manner, \nwhether the government will become more authoritarian and people less free, whether there \nwill be more censorship and less civil rights depends on many factors. We believe that the \ncritical issue to be monitored in the near future is how bans will be lifted in the quarantine \neasing process or whether government officials will try to keep them indefinitely, with the \nopportunity to use them to their advantage. \nAlong with the possible threats, we believe that the pandemic will create several \npositive opportunities for democracy, as paradoxical as it may sound. In particular, \nobjective preconditions will force the state, the expert community, and the public to \naccelerate the introduction of innovation processes in democratic procedures and \ninstitutions. \nIn our opinion, the pandemic can give impetus to a new round of development of edemocracy\ninstitutions. By analogy with business, education, finance, which is a pandemic \nimplement remote forms of work and provide remote access to customers to their services, \nthe sphere of public policy will undergo similar transformations. Accordingly, governments \nmust learn to communicate with each other and with citizens using modern information and \ncommunication technologies without losing efficiency and without increasing costs. Thus, \n5\nSHS Web of Conferences 126, 06007 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202112606007\nSDPPP-2021\n', 'the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic should provide an impetus for innovation in electoral \ntechnologies and voting processes, public access to administrative services, e-government \nand other democratic institutions.  \nYascha Mounk, an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University and a senior fellow \nat the Council on Foreign Relations, described Democracy on the Defense \nas optimistic about the spread of democracy worldwide. However, this confident optimism \nwas inappropriate. Looking back, it is clear that it was naive to expect democracy to spread \nto all parts of the world. The authoritarian turn of recent years reflects the shortcomings of \ndemocratic systems. But they omit an important part of the picture. The history of the past \ntwo decades - is not just a story of the weakness of democracy; it also determines \nauthoritarian capacity. According to official statements, the democratization of the world is \nproclaimed one of the main goals of U.S. foreign policy, but these statements are seriously \ncriticized. This direction of foreign policy is due to the popular theory of the democratic \nworld in the United States, which is mentioned in the speeches of leaders of both dominant \nparties. In the above-mentioned article Yasha Munch defined that the United States seeks to \nrestore the role of "leader of the free world." Biden and his team have announced their \nintention to convene a summit of democracies to support democracies in combating the \nthreats of autocrats, which will signal the U.S. commitment to democratic values. The \nproblem is that the two main goals of the effort (deterring the influence of powerful \nautocracies and preventing collapse in key democracies) often contradict each other [20]. \nTherefore, the American researcher J. Munch determines that in the coming decades \nthere should be a long struggle between democracy and autocracy. Since the 1990s, \nautocratic regimes have advanced in terms of economic performance and military power. \nLeaders have learned to use digital tools to subtly suppress opposition movements. They \nrepulsed democratic campaigns, significantly increased international influence, this is not \nonly a retreat from democracy, but a revival of authoritarian regimes [20]. \nThe result of this competition has not been determined. To win, the United States and \nits democratic allies need to understand the importance of these historic moments, working \ntogether to defend global democracy in creative, bold ways, unlike in the past. They will \nalso need to resolve the dilemma arising from the contradictions between the two main \ngoals: on the one hand, to stop retreats in their ranks, on the other hand, to support a united \nfront against authoritarian regimes such as those in China and Russia. Addressing this \ndilemma requires a skilful approach that preserves the possibility of cooperating with \ncountries that have questionable democratic principles of good faith while maintaining a \nclose partnership for indeed democratic allies. It will also mean abandoning the "promotion \nof democracy" in favour of "protecting democracy" for security purposes. Yasha Munch \nstressed that the step in preventing the revival of the authoritarian regime is the reform of \ntwo prominent institutions of the liberal international order: the E.U. and NATO. The \nAmericans and Europeans who created these bodies believed that their own countries \nwould never have the collapse of democracy. As a result of this approach, these \norganizations do not have easy means to suspend membership or expel a member whose \nbehaviour has changed. This is particularly problematic for the E.U., which requires its \nmembers to sacrifice a degree of sovereignty to join the bloc. It is sometimes complicated \nfor national politicians to explain this to their constituents. Most E.U. countries do not \naddress transnational issues, such as climate change or the impact on world politics. \nBecause these countries uphold democracy, the rule of law, and the renunciation of a \ndegree of independence, allowing them to promote common democratic values. However, \nthe increase in the number of authoritarian leaders in the E.U. (Hungary, etc.) undermines \nthe legitimacy of the bloc. It is crucial to resolve this contradiction, and the E.U. is facing a \nlegitimacy crisis that current institutions cannot resolve. This requires political capital, \ndiplomatic pressure, legal, organizational rethinking. \n6\nSHS Web of Conferences 126, 06007 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202112606007\nSDPPP-2021\n', 'the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic should provide an impetus for innovation in electoral \ntechnologies and voting processes, public access to administrative services, e-government \nand other democratic institutions.  \nYascha Mounk, an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University and a senior fellow \nat the Council on Foreign Relations, described Democracy on the Defense \nas optimistic about the spread of democracy worldwide.

Addressing this \ndilemma requires a skilful approach that preserves the possibility of cooperating with \ncountries that have questionable democratic principles of good faith while maintaining a \nclose partnership for indeed democratic allies. It will also mean abandoning the "promotion \nof democracy" in favour of "protecting democracy" for security purposes. Yasha Munch \nstressed that the step in preventing the revival of the authoritarian regime is the reform of \ntwo prominent institutions of the liberal international order: the E.U. and NATO. The \nAmericans and Europeans who created these bodies believed that their own countries \nwould never have the collapse of democracy. As a result of this approach, these \norganizations do not have easy means to suspend membership or expel a member whose \nbehaviour has changed. This is particularly problematic for the E.U., which requires its \nmembers to sacrifice a degree of sovereignty to join the bloc. It is sometimes complicated \nfor national politicians to explain this to their constituents. Most E.U. countries do not \naddress transnational issues, such as climate change or the impact on world politics. \nBecause these countries uphold democracy, the rule of law, and the renunciation of a \ndegree of independence, allowing them to promote common democratic values. However, \nthe increase in the number of authoritarian leaders in the E.U. (Hungary, etc.) undermines \nthe legitimacy of the bloc. It is crucial to resolve this contradiction, and the E.U. is facing a \nlegitimacy crisis that current institutions cannot resolve. This requires political capital, \ndiplomatic pressure, legal, organizational rethinking. \nIn an article on the collapse of democracy in 2018, researchers L. Janetti (Licia \nCianetti), James Dawson and Seán Hanley argued that the emergence of populist \nmovements in Central and Eastern Europe, such as "Babiš ANO" in the Czech Republic, is \n"Potentially ambiguous phenomenon, formulating real social needs in political reform, \nputting the issue of effective governance in the spotlight" [21]. \nIn a 2019 document presented by the International Association of Political \nPsychologists, Sean Rosenberg argues that right-wing populism exposes the vulnerability \nof democratic structures and that "democracy is likely to consume itself." \nResearchers are determining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collapse of \ndemocracy. Many national governments have postponed or cancelled democratic elections \nat both the national and subnational levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has \nidentified gaps in democratic practices.   \nThus, the local elections in the U.K. in 2020 were postponed for a year. At the \nbeginning of the crisis, U.N. experts recommended appropriate measures to the \ngovernment, which were "necessary and non-discriminatory" [24]. \nThe collapse of democracy through a pandemic is a unique deviation from democracy \nassociated with national crises. This happens when leaders impose authoritarian rules \nduring a state of emergency, the crisis in the country, or remain in place after the situation \nimproves. This happened in several countries during the coronavirus pandemic. \nAccording to the V-Dem Institute, only 39% of all countries did not commit minor \nviolations of democratic standards in response to Covid-19 [25]. \nEven though liberal democracy was defended and experienced an increase in the \nnumber of autocrats and authoritarian regimes in many parts of the world until the first \ndeath from the coronavirus in December 2019, the pandemic affected the collapse of \ndemocracy [26]. \nGiven that COVID-19 spread worldwide in early 2020, the global decline in freedom \nhas intensified [27].  \nThe outbreak exposed the weaknesses of all components of democracy, from elections \nand the rule of law to extremely disproportionate restrictions on freedom of assembly and \nmovement. Democracies and autocracies have had successes and failures in the fight \nagainst the virus itself, although citizens in authoritarian states have lacked the tools to \nconfront them. After all, the changes caused by the pandemic have left many societies (with \ndifferent regimes, incomes and demographics) in worse political situations, with more \npronounced racial, ethnic and gender characteristics of inequality, vulnerable to long-term \nconsequences. Transparency has been one of the most affected aspects of democratic \ngovernance. National and local officials in China have diligently blocked information about \nthe outbreak, including through mass arrests of Internet users who shared the information. \nIn December, journalist Zhang Zhan was sentenced to four years in prison for \nreporting Wuhan as the initial epicenter. The Belarusian government has been actively \ndownplaying the seriousness of the pandemic to the public, which has refused to take \naction, while the Iranian regime has concealed the real victims of the virus. Some \nrepressive governments, including Turkmenistan and Nicaragua, have ignored reality and \ndenied the presence of the pathogen in their territory. More open political systems have also \nexperienced significant problems with transparent information. \nAt the presidential, state level, U.S. officials provided fictitious data and actively \nspread misinformation about the transmission and treatment of coronavirus, leading to \nconfusion and politicization of what was to become a health issue. Similarly, Brazilian \nPresident Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly promoted untested treatments that have cast doubt \non the usefulness of masks and vaccines. \nGovernments have also deployed surveillance measures, which have often been of \ndubious value to public health and have a limited number of precautionary measures \n7\nSHS Web of Conferences 126, 06007 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202112606007\nSDPPP-2021\n', 'against abuse.

Waves of false \ninformation were generated. There was a misconception that democracy was declining \nbecause it could not solve people\'s problems and needs.  \nProspects for further research of the scientific problem: a number of problems related \nto the process of obtaining administrative services by citizens remain unresolved, which \nshould be addressed not only at the local but also at the national level. Therefore, the \nelimination of the above problems requires a comprehensive approach, namely: the \nadoption of new regulations and improve existing ones in order to simplify the procedure \nfor obtaining administrative services; creation of remote workplaces and mobile offices in \norder to ensure the availability of administrative services for the population not only in \nlarge settlements, but also throughout Ukraine. \nConclusions \nDemocracy is not just a cherished ideal but a phenomenon that is the public administration \nsystem best suited to overcome the crisis of scale and complexity of COVID-19. Only \nthrough democracy can societies strengthen the social trust that allows them to continue to \nlive in a crisis, maintain national resilience in the face of difficulties, resolve profound \ndifferences in society through full participation and dialogue, and maintain confidence that \nthe return will be shared and the rights of all citizens will be respected and guaranteed. \nThe impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on the functioning of democratic \ninstitutions shows that the pandemic is an emergency that requires maximum mobilization \nof state resources. A proper and effective anti-crisis policy of the state is essential for \novercoming or at least reducing the negative impact of the pandemic on democracy. No less \nimportant is that the Ukrainian government must also actively care about security - much \nmore than in those countries where there is no war. Especially since many citizens are \nvigilant to ensure that it does not make significant concessions to the enemy, and in a \npandemic, their vigilance has only increased. In contrast to the selfish allegations of \nauthoritarian propaganda, credible and information-based flows of strategic options, \nvoluntary self-organization of civil society, and open interaction between government and \nsociety are all vital tools in the fight against a pandemic. Only with the help of democracy \ncan an independent civil society be allowed to establish partnerships with state institutions. \nOnly through democracy can society ensure a sustainable balance between competing \nneeds and priorities - between fighting the spread of the virus and protecting people\'s civil \nand political rights in accordance with constitutional guarantees. \nThe consequences of the coronavirus pandemic\'s impact on democracy are \ncentralization of power; restriction of fundamental human rights; enhanced state \nsupervision; restriction of protests; "Interruptions" in elections; imbalance of civil-military \nrelations; pressure on civil society; resumption of the discussion "authoritarianism against \ndemocracy". The pandemic crisis has stimulated the demand for the involvement and use of \ndigital technologies in various spheres of society and the state. \nPandemic Crisis management involves assessing the appropriate duration of the \nquarantine regime, taking into account all identified risks and ensuring appropriate \nadaptation of crisis measures, in particular: creating a multilevel risk management system \nand improving strategic planning and analysis as essential elements of crisis management \nand decision-making. Rights and freedoms of citizens; providing society with the necessary \nsupport to prevent the irreversible negative consequences of a pandemic, etc. With the \nspread of COVID-19, the democratic spectrum has repeatedly resorted to excessive control, \ndiscriminatory restrictions on freedoms, such as movement and mass assembly, and \narbitrary or coercive coercion to such restrictions. \nReferences \n9\nSHS Web of Conferences 126, 06007 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202112606007\nSDPPP-2021\n', '1.
