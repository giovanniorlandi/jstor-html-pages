Garfield to her husband some years \'be\nfore \'he was made president of the United States, while\nthey wicre experiencing some of the "ups and downs"\nof life, \'carries a moral which docs not need pointing\nout:\n"I a glaid to tell you that out of all the toll and\ndisappointment of the summer just ended I have risen\nup to a victory; that silence of thought since you have\nbctjii away has won for my spirit a triumph.\n"I read something like this the other day: \'There\nis no heaJthy thought without labor, and thought makes\nthe labor happy.\' Perhaps this is why I have been able\nto climb up higher. It came to me one morning when I\nwas making bread. I said to myself, \'Here I am com\npelled by an inexorable necessity to ma.ke our bread\nthis summer. - Why not consider it a pleasant occupa\ntion, and make it so by seeing what a perfect bread I\ncan ma,ke?\' It seemed like, aim inspiration and the whole,\nof life became brighter. The very sunshine seemed to\nbe flowing through my spirit into the white loaves and\nnow I believe my table is furnished with better bread\nthan ever before; and this truth, old as creation\', seems\njust now to have become fully mine that I need not to\nbe the shirking slave of toil, -but its regal master, mak\ning whatever I do yield me its best fruits.\n"You have been king of your work so long that\nmay be you will laugh at me for \'having lived so long\nwithout my crown, but 1 am too gla.d to have found it\nat all to be entirely disconcerted even by your merri-\nv.\nment. . (\n"Now, I wonder if right he e does not He the \'terri\nble wrong,\' or a.t least some of it, of which the woman\nsuffragists complain. The wrongly educated woman\nthimks her duties a disgrace and frets under them, or\nshirks them if she can. She sees man triumphantly pur\nsuing his vocations, and thinks it is the kind of work he\ndoes which makes him grand and regnant; whereas\nit is not the kind\' of work at alV, but the way in which\nand the spirit with which: he docs it."\noo\nSTUDY THE CHILD LABOR LAW\nOne of the measures before congress which should\nengage the attention of every woman is the Child Labor\nlaw.\nDr. A. J. McKelway in a recent statement made to\nthe National Child Labor committee stated that ot the\n100,000,000 people in the United States, more than 97,\n000,000 had committed themselves to the 14-yeair age\nlimit through, their legislatures. The p-eople recognize\nthait tlie federal law will be a great aid in enforcing la,ws\n"already in existence in many of the states, while it will\nproject children now employed under lower standards\nin other states. .\nThat anyone should wish to employ children under\nfourteen years of age- in mine\'s, mills and factories seems\nimpossible, but yet such is the caste, and a hard fight is\nbeing made in congress to defeat the 14-yea,r age limit\nc\'aus\noo \'\n- WANT CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT\nThe forty Oregon delegates to the biennial session\nof \'the General \'Federation of Women\'s clubs in. New\nYork May 22d will be instructed! to vote for Mrs. Josiah\nKyans Cowles of Los Angeles for the federation presi\ndency. Other western delegates are expected to vote\nfor her, also. ,.\nMrs. Coyles, they argue, gave up her aspirations tor,\nthe presidency- two years ago that California might be\ndesignated the last mtetin-g place. There will be 30.00U\ndelegates representing 2,000,000 women at the conven\ntion \' v \'\nWILL LINE UP AS A UNIT\n"American women believe in .military preparedness\nagainst war and they will have much! to do with shap\ning the military policy of the United States\'," said Mrs.\nFrederick A. Dow, Chicago club woman, past general\npresident and1 present general secretary of the Illinois\nFederation1 of Women\'s clubs, who is expected to bring\nthe matter up a.t the General Federation, convention to\nbe held in New York City the last week in May.\n"American women do not want war but they clearly\nsee that the duty of this nation is to be prepared for\nany aggressor," Mrs. Dow said. "It took our army to\'\nlo.irg to get into action after the Co\'umbus raid. I was\ntalking to the proud mother of four sons the other day\nand she said: \'I don\'t want .my four sons to go into\nbattle, but when thdr country calls I expect them to go.\'\nOnce the danger asserts itself the women of America\nwill line up as a unit, as they have done in European\ncountries, to repel the aggressor."\noo\nCampaign Iowa for Votes for Women\nThe; final round up of the Iowa campaign for votes,\nfor women opened in Des Moines last Thursday with the\narrival of Mrs. Carrie Chapman\' Catt, international suf\nfrage leader, whot will give her time from\' now until\nthe election in June to the campaign, delivering at\nleast 100 speeches in every county in the state. Later\nin the campaign Mrs. Catt will probaibly travel in a\nspecial car attached to regular trains, e\'scorted by state\nleaders.\noo\nForty-eight babies were examined at the opening\nday of Reno\'s "Better Baby" week, six Remo physicians\nhaving the work in- charge.
