        <pre>["EASTERN EUROPE AND THE BALKANS\nThe Alleged “Arming” of The Balkan States\nBy FR E D E R IC  A . O G G\nP rofessor of P olitical Science, University of W isconsin;\nCurrent H istory A ssociate\nTHE delicacy of the Balkan situation, \nwhich was strikingly portrayed by \nformer Premier Nitti in an article in \nLa Federation BalJcanique in January, has \nreceived fresh illustration in the nervous\xad\nness aroused in recent weeks by various \ndevelopments related to the alleged arming \nof Balkan States. The finger of suspicion \nhas been pointed at two States in particular, \ni. e., Bulgaria and Hungary.\nIn the case of Bulgaria, M. Briand, act\xad\ning as President of the Council of Am\xad\nbassadors rather than as French Foreign \nMinister, judged it necessary toward the \nmiddle of January to send the Secretary \nGeneral of the League of Nations a state\xad\nment charging that Bulgaria had not lived \nup to her disarmament engagements under \nthe Neuilly treaty. The note complained \nthat there had not been adequate enforce\xad\nment of the treaty stipulations concern\xad\ning army recruiting and organization, and, \nin particular, called attention to the fact \nthat while the Sofia Government long ago \npromised that Article 71 of the national \nConstitution, which embodies the principle \nof compulsory military service—a principle \nincompatible with the requirements of the \ntreaty—would be revised at the first meet\xad\ning of the National Assembly, no such re\xad\nvision had yet taken place. The note con\xad\ncluded with the suggestion that it might \nbecome necessary to bring into operation \nArticle 104 of the treaty, which requires \nBulgaria, so long as the Neuilly treaty re\xad\nmains in force, to submit to any investi\xad\ng a t io n  which the L e a g u e  C ou n cil may con\xad\nsider necessary.\nThough no new developments have been \ndisclosed, the protest is before the League, \nand will require action. At Sofia it was \nbelieved that since the situation complained \nof had existed all along, and since no cen\xad\nsure had been officially registered until \nthen, there must be something behind the \nBriand document not revealed in the text. \nIt has been stated repeatedly, at least \nsemi-officially, that the countiy has no in\xad\ntention of rewriting its Constitution in \norder to meet the approval of the Council \nof Ambassadors or any other alien body.\nAn event that attracted more public at\xad\ntention and that has roused more appre\xad\nhension in official circles was the finding, \non New Year’s Day, of five freight cars \nloaded with machine guns, 2,000 in all, at \nthe railroad station of St. Gothard on the \nAustro-Hungarian frontier, and the subse\xad\nquent discovery that the consignment was \nfrom a factory at Verona, Italy, and that \nalthough it was ostensibly intended for Po\xad\nland, it was actually intended for Hungary. \nThe episode released many rumors that \nHungary was secretly arming herself with \nthe help of Italy, in direct contravention \nof the treaty of Trianon, and a Hungarian \npaper published in the Czechoslovak town \nof Bratislava added to the flames by print\xad\ning extended “ revelations”  by a professional \nspy, Vattay by name, to the effect that for \nthree years freight cars labeled “ agricul\xad\ntural implements” or “ vegetables” had'been \nsent into Hungary consigned to points in \nRumania or other adjoining countries, but \nhad never left the country; also that large \nstocks of ammunition were being amassed \nin caves near Balatontowa and Lipotmezoo, \nbut so well concealed that the Interallied \nMilitary Commission recently passed close \nby without noticing anything.\nThe discovery at St. Gothard naturally \nstirred repercussions at Prague, Belgrade, \nBucharest and other capitals, and it was \nshortly given out that the Cabinets of the \nLittle Entente had agreed to send a joint \nnote to the League Secretariat asking an \nofficial inquiry into the presence of arms in \nHungarian territory. Much diplomatic jock\xad\ne y in g  en su ed . I t a ly  an d  H u n g a r y  s o u g h t  to\nhush up the affair and particularly to fore\xad\nstall a League investigation. Great Britain \nand Germany were also willing to let the \nmatter drop. France, on the other hand, \ncategorically refused to pass it over. The \nmotives, especially of Germany and France, \nwere clear enough. If the League has the \npower to investigate armaments in Hun\xad\ngary it has the power to do so in Germany. \nOn the contrary, if the inquiry into Hun\xad\ngarian armaments could be blocked, Ger\xad\nmany would have hopes of being able to \nblock any inquiry into her armaments. \nFrance’s stand was, therefore, concerned \nprimarily with Germany rather than with \nHungary.\n903\n", '904 CURRENT HISTORY, MARCH, 1928\nRumania’s Foreign Minister, M. Titulcsco, \nhappened at the time to be paying an of\xad\nficial visit to Rome and for an interval this \ntied their hands. Eventually, however, she \nwas ready to cooperate, and on Feb. 1 three \nnotes—one from each of the Little Entente \nStates—found their way to Geneva. The \nthree were practically identical in substance \nand all went considerably further than of\xad\nficials of the League had hoped or expected. \nAfter relating the facts of the St. Gothard \nincident they cited the decisions of the \nLeague Council on Dec. 11, 1926, relative to \nthe exercise of the right of investigation, \nurged that in the “general interest”  full \nlight should be shed upon the affair in order \nthat “public confidence in public treaties \nwill not be shaken,”  and then proceeded to \ncall upon the Council to “ fulfill its duty” by \nintei-vening in the matter and “ taking such \nmeasures”  as come within its rights under \nthe Treaty of Trianon concerning the mili\xad\ntary control of Hungary. Instead of asking \nthe League to intercede merely by moral \nsuasion, or even moral pressure, for the pur\xad\npose of preventing any undue arming of the \nBalkan States, as was expected, the notes \ndemanded that the Council intervene and \nthat the subject be inscribed in the order of \nthe day at the next Council session.\nThe matter was therefore scheduled to \ncome before the Council of the League at its \nMarch meeting. The problem is, indeed, a \ndifficult one. A  simple majority is sufficient \nto set the machinery of inquiry in action. \nItaly, it was understood, expected to be able \nto block the investigation. On the other \nhand, the French Cabinet, although said to \nbe desirous of a better understanding with \nRome, gave every indication of unwilling\xad\nness to allow Mussolini to stifle the effort \nto lay bare the method by which five car\xad\nloads of plows shipped from Verona got \ntransformed into rapid-fire machine guns \nbefore they reached Hungary. Back of \neverything else loomed the question of what \neventually would be the effect upon Ger\xad\nmany if the Council were to decide that it \ncould not, or would not, take up the investi\xad\ngation in Hungary.\nThe visit of M. Titulesco to Rome and his \nprotracted conference with Premier Musso\xad\nlini on Jan. 25 roused interest in European \nchancelleries which centred by no means \nentirely in Rumania’s attitude on the alleged \nshipment of Italian aims to Hungary. It \nbad been generally known for a good while \nthat Mussolini was making a strong bid for \nRumanian friendship, and there was curios\xad\nity to observe what results, if  any, the con\xad\nference would have. The only statements\nITALIAN ARMS IN HUNGARY \n“The machine guns are packed in cotton, \nbut how shall we declare them.”\n“As cotton, of course.”\n—Der Goetz von Berlichingen, Vienna.\ngiven out on either side were somewhat \ncryptic, yet definite enough to indicate not \nonly that the discussions were amicable, hut \nthat an ltalo-Rumanian rapprochement was \nimpending.\nThat Mussolini should look to Rumania \nto play an important role in the develop\xad\nment of his Balkan policy is not surprising. \nThere is an important racial kinship be\xad\ntween Rumanian and Italian peoples and \nthe country’s geographical location on the \neastern flank of the Balkans, with an out\xad\nlet on the Black Sea, makes it a highly \ndesirable ally from a strategic point of \nview. Heretofore, however, Bucharest has \nInclined rather more toward France than \ntoward Italy; relations with Czechoslovakia \nand Yugoslavia in the Little Entente made \nthis inevitable. Dealings with Italy were, \nindeed, cordial during the Averescu pre\xad\nmiership and plans were laid for supple\xad\nmenting an existing- treaty of good-will \nwith a treaty of commerce. When, how\xad\never, the late Jon Bratiano resumed the \nPremiership, the negotiations were broken \no ff and foreign policy resumed its tradi\xad\ntional anti-Italian slant. Even Italy’s for\xad\nmal recognition of Rumania’s annexation \nof Bessarabia seemed to make little differ\xad\nence.\nRecently, however, a change in the Ru\xad\nmanian attitude toward Italy has been\n', "EASTERN EUROPE AND THE BALKANS 905\nstrongly in evidence. The tone of the \nRumanian press has changed completely. \nIt is recalled that when France, after suc\xad\ncessfully negotiating defensive treaties \nwith Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, sought \na similar understanding with Rumania, she \nwas obliged to accept a treaty that went no \nfurther than good-will and commerce.. As \nhas been pointed out, Rumania was the last \nof the Little Entente States to decide to \napproach the League on the matter of the \narms shipment to Hungary and her protest \nis considered to have less feeling behind \nit than the expressions of her allies. Out\xad\nwardly friendly and indeed allied, Rumania \nand Yugoslavia have perceptibly cooled in \ntheir relations with one another. Russia's \nsteady refusal to accept Bucharest’s pro\xad\nposals for a treaty of non-aggression makes \nItalian friendship look increasingly valu\xad\nable. All told, a fresh orientation of \nBucharest’s foreign policy in the direction \nof a close understanding with Rome seems \ndecidedly probable and it is certainly not \nwithout significance that, following the \nconference of Jan. 25, M. Titulesco an\xad\nnounced that the once abandoned commer\xad\ncial treaty between the two governments \nwould be completed shortly.\nThe possibilities of the international situ\xad\nation thus outlined lend special interest to \nthe efforts which the Rumanian National \nPeasants’ Party has been making to force \na national election in April. The fight of \nGovernment and Opposition has become, \nin effect, a duel between the Liberal Party, \nled by the present Premier, Vintila Bra- \ntiano, and the National Peasants’ organiza\xad\ntion, led by M. Maniu. The other pax-ties\nhave retired into the background, includ\xad\ning that of Professor Jorga, which has as \nits leader a man of broad learning and a \npolitician of wide horizon, but has too little \nhold in the country, and the party of Gen\xad\neral Averescu, which at this moment is \npassing through an internal crisis. The \nNational Peasants’ Party is the one large \ngroup hostile and dangerous to the exist\xad\ning Government, and it professes to be con\xad\nfident that if it can but compel a general \nelection to be held it will drive the Lib\xad\nerals from power. An active campaign to- \nward this end was launched on Jan. 29 with \na meeting at Jassy, attended, it is reported, \nby 8,000 enthusiastic opponents of the pi-es- \nent regime. The rumor that Premier Bra- \ntiano is, for reasons of health, not unwill\xad\ning to resign, has, howevei-, been categori\xad\ncally denied, and the firm insistence of \nthe Ministry that it is in nowise to be re- \ngarded as merely a provisional Government \n—a stop-gap—is taken to mean that there \nis no intention to permit power to slip from \nthe hands of those who have so long held it.\nAccording to an Associated Press dispatch, \ndemonstrations and lively fistic encountei-s \ntook place at Budapest University on Feb. \n13, when Christian students proclaimed a \nsti-ike as a protest against the Government’s \nintention to inci-ease the quota of Jews per\xad\nmitted to enroll in the university. The stu\xad\ndents barricaded the university doors and \nforced those seeking admission to prove \ntheir identity. All students attending lec- \ntui-es in defiance of the strike order were \nexpelled from the class rooms. The students \nat Szegedin University likewise declared a \nsti-ike.\nNATIONS OF NORTHERN EUROPF.\nNew Phases of Lithuanian-Polish Dispute\nBy M IL T O N  O F F U T T\nD epartment of H istory, Johns H opkins University;\nC u r r e n t  H istory  A sso c ia te\nOPTIMISTS who pi-ofesscd to believe \nthat the stormy and dramatic scene \nbetween Premier Augustine Walde- \nmaras and Marshal Pilsudski during the \nDecember meeting of the League of Na\xad\ntions would not only avert an imminent \nwar between Poland and Lithuania, but \nwould result in a speedy resumption of cor\xad\ndial and normal relations between the two \nStates must have been disappointed by the\ndevelopments of January. As the chance \nof war became more remote and the diplo\xad\nmats of the great Powers turned their at\xad\nt ntion to other affairs the ghost of Vilna \nremained unlaid along with the bitterness \ncreated by seven years of propaganda and \nmutual reciiminations.
