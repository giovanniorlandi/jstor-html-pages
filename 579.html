The Appeal figures that\nthe new gold has amounted to only $i 33 per capita throughout\nthe United States and considers this \'a gleeful sort of knock out\nanswer.\nEvidently the Appeal is not aware that the addition of $1 33\nper capita meant the increase per capita of nearly eight per cent.\nPossibly even the Appeal, in its sober moments, will concede\nthat adding eight per cent to the business of a nation, or to its\nmoney is no trifle. The Appeal should never indulge in the lux\nury of figures. They are useful weapons in the hands of the\nskilled, but mighty dangerous things to fool with unless you know\nwhat you are handling. They sometimes go off. New s.\nIf this eight per cent mentioned by our contemporary was\nevenly distributed, it would be worth considering. If the News\nwill think a moment it will realize that the extra $100,000,000 a\nyear that rolls into the channels of trade from the Klondike has\ngone into the pockets of the steel trust alone. There are other\ncombines nearly as rapacious, who absorb all the money resulting\nfrom new discoveries of the precious metals, as fast as it comes in\nto circulation.\nThe $100,000,000 is only a drop upon the vast sea of greed and\nspeculation. The tariff on the farmer\'s implements of industry\ntakes up that eight per cent and turns it into the coffers of the steel\ntrust.\nThe housewife who gets the eight per cent mentioned by the\nNews, turns it right over to the salt, sugar and coffee trusts.\nThn business man is in ths same fix. The artisan and laborer\nand every man who toils, turns every dollar that comes in because\nof the increased circulation, over to some tariff fostered combine,\nwhose license to rob the public is given to them signed and sealed\nby the Republican party in payment of election pledges made in\nthe last campaign.\nAt the end of the year this eight per cent that looks so rosey\nto the News has melted away like snow and been sluiced into the\nmill race of the Republican trusts. Yes indeed, figures are some\ntimes dangerous things to fool with. 1\n\'HE wife of Chester F. Wright, the San Francisco corset manu\nfacturer, has been granted a divoice from her husband be\ncause of the proof presented in court that he for seme years past\nhad been in the habit of beating her unmercifully. Now here is a\nsplendid chance for the women of San Francisco to show their dis\napproval of brutal husbands, by refusing to wear corsets made by\nWright. If the corsets fit all righ t however, it is a dead moral cer\ntainty that they will do nothing of the kind. They can condone\nwife beating, but not a man who makes a badly fitting corset.\nTotal expenditures 1001.\nNevada Eus!re\nNumber of risks written 92\nAmount of risks v-ritttii ..$207,500,00\nPremiums received $14,003.01\nLosses paid\nLosses incurred ,\nNumber of policies in forte\nDec. 31, 1901 248\nAmount of same $639,632.00\nA.

It was passed, however,\nat a very great disturbance to the Republican majority in the Sen\nate, some of the ablest members of that party voting against the\niniquitous act. It now goes to the House for approval. It is to be\nhoped in the interest of the people generally and in the interest\nof the very American merchant marine, which it is alleged to help\nthat the President will veto this iniquitous measure, should it\npass the House, where it ought to be killed.

In Rev this kind of work has re\nsulted in the discovery of valuable\nclaims, and that section is no better\nsituated than this. Along with the\nclaim development a public exhibit of\nthe ores extracted are shown. By\ndoing this valuable minerals can be\ncompared and the discoverer knows\nwhat he has found. Many ores are\nbrought into this city that no one\ntseems to be able to classify. Johnny\nPorterfield has found a ledge of min\neral that looks like native copper, but\nwhen put to the tests shows no sign\nof the red metal. What it is puzzles\neveryone that has looked at it. It\nmay be a valuable mineral but from\nlack of classification the owrer is un\nable to receive any results.\nA public exhibit of all the minerals\nthat have been determined, their as\nsay and market values, would help\neveryone that is interested in this line\nThis summer will see more prospect\ning in this section than has taken\nplace in years. A room where all the\nminerals could be exhibited would not\nonly add to the revival of mining but\nwould furnish information to those\nwho follow the business. There is a big\ncabinet of ores in the Capital build\ning, but it is useless, as the samples\nare unmarked and no one seems to\nknow their values or where they come\nIrom.\nThe parties interested in mining\ncould well afford to secure space for\na cabinet, and see that the samples\nare marked properly Many hand\nsome specimens are being found, and\nif placed on exhibitions, strangers, es\npecially mining men, would take an\ninterest in it, and it might lead to\ninvestment. This is the reason that\nReno is fitting up a public exhibition\nroom and Carson had better fellow\nsuit.\nThere has recently been presented\nto the State Library by the author Jos\neph T. Goodman of Alameda, and for-\nLmerly the editor of the Enterprise, his\n.vory. "Eioiogia of Central America."\nThe book is a large volume and pro\nfusely illustrated. It treats of the\nchronology of a race of people who\nlived in Central America so long ago\nJJiat now there is nothing but their\nruined temples and what is left of the\ninscriptions upon the altars to remind\none of their existence. About twenty\nyears ago Mr, Goodwin became inter\nested in these inscriptions a2 reach\ned he conclusion that they represent\ned numerals. With this idea he be\ngan the systematic labor of decypher\ning them.\nHe delved and plodded at this seem\ningly impossible and thankless task\nfor seven year3 before he could with\nany certainty tell the meaning of a\nsingle glyph. After he once found the\nkey he had less trouble and then what\nfor thousands of years had been a\nsealed book to the archeologists of\nboth hemisphers. v.;as, by his indefat\nagable researches, opened to the\nworld. In his work he conclusively\ndemonstrates that they kept a cal\nendar, the most perfect of any system\nof noting the flight of time ever de\nvised, which shows that they existed\nfor over 2SJ.0M0 years. He shows\nthat Adam was a mere tenderfoot up\non the earth. This work is now rec\nognised the world over as standard\nauthority upon the subject.\nThat it remained for a Nevada edi\ntor to tolve the mystery that has\nshrouded the archeology of that won\nderful country, should be a source of\ncongratulation to the sagebrush craft,\nWhile the book is not one of ab\nsorbing interest to most people, any\none who cares to investigate what the\nhuman brain is capable of doing will\nSomewhat Risky.\nThe Reno Journal advances the idea\nof having the Silver and Democratic\nConventions at Reno this fall, meet\nas one Convention.
