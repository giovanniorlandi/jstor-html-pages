I(i.\nPBSTOMTIOiSIof*\nrbRT\nff sJaJPIM I X£SrOR£P\nC.■ \' - •\nThere is probably no feature of the\ncoining observance of the tercentenary\nof the discovery of Lake Champlain\nwhich appeals more strongly to his\ntoric interest than does the restoration\nof old Fort Ticonderoga. Into the warp\nand woof of American history the\nname Ticonderoga has been indelibly\nworked through years of bitter war\nfare. and the feet that this historic old\nfortification, fast falling to decay, ia to\nbe saved to succeeding generations\nthrough the intervention of a woman,\ncoupled with the fact that the work\nof restoration has now’ progressed so\nfar that was possible to entertain on\nTuesday, July 6, the president of the\nUnited St ites in the very building in\nwhich on May 10, 1775, Ethan Allen\nmade his famous demand for the sur\nrender of the fortification, “In the\nname of the great Jehovah and the\ncontinental congress," gives to the\ncelebration a place in the hearts of\nthe people of the United States which\nmay not be disputed.\nIt is at the direction of Mrs. S. H. P.\nPell of New York that Fort Tlcon\nderoga is being restored. Mrs. Pell,\nwho is the daughter of Col. Robert\nr i . ompson of New York, is 1 1.. wife of\nStephen H. I’. Pell, a prominent Now\nYork banker. Roth her husband and\nlather are interested in seeing her\nproject landed through to a success\nful conclusion and are aiding it in\n♦■very way possible. Members of\nthe New York like Champlain tercen\ntenary commission are also deeply in\nterested in Mrs. Fell\'s plan to restore\nthe old fort, and have accorded her\nrepresentatives every possible consid\neration with regard to the arrange\nment of the celebration exercises as\nregards Ticonderoga. Alfred C. Ros\nsom of New York city, who Is the\narchitect in charge of the work for\nMrs Poll, estimates that the work of\ncompletely restoring the fort will oc\n\'l P>’ a period of fen years and the\nestimated cost has been placed at\n$500,000. After a conference with the\nmembers of the New York Lake Cham\nplain tercentenary commission it was\ndecided that it would bo best to con\ncentrate the work of restoration upon\nthat building known as the west bar\nr. \' l-. 5," and this has been done.\nTo insure absolute accuracy in the\nrestoration of the fort. Mr Rossoni\nspent a considerable period of time in\n1 ‘ isonal examination of old records\nand prints in the possession of the\nU; r.\'h and English governments, <■ rrl\nnow has representatives in those coun\ntries ran hilly going o r each minor\ndetail of construction Thus far, how\ncv r. the architect and hi< workers\nhave found the fort itself as thorough\nly a reliable guide to its n e.-.nstnir\nlion as could be wished, for when the\ndebris Is cleared away from the line\nof a wall the old-fashioned door\nbangers, lo> ks and knobs are found\nml.ere they dropped to the ground as\nthe place c; dually fell to decay. Many\nof these old article? are used as mod\nels for the construction of new and\nstrong r* pi; as a* the hands of skill* and\nartisans F-obably one of the most\ninteresting tlnds was a rail of home\nspun cloth in a fairly rood -•a*< of\nn r n f\nRn ..rtrh ?h oIP*II •at - >n v. ■ •;\nis situated on the lak* shore just\nbelow the site of the •\' n at ! w\nIs al-o being r--\' • and to P • f< • r\ngan ■ an !;• r*\nwatch -as found soon a . : the work\nwas started last November. On the\nsite of the fort enough pieces of pot\ntery have been found to make a com\nplete service, and duplicates of these\nare being made at great cost, for the\ninteresting old pattern Is very hard to\nreproduce. The most of these pieces\nwere found directly below the old\nmessroom. One pottery punch bowl\nwhich has been found in a fine state\nof preservation bears upon the hot\ntom the inscription: "Success to Gen\nAmherst," and has been identified as\na punch howl given him by friends in\nNew York before his campaign in tie\nLake Champlain country. Any quan\ncity of old-fashioned knives and forks\nhave been found, a perfect oliMash\nioned bottle and many bar-shot, can\nulster shot, mortar shells, cf.nnon\nballs and pieces of guns.\nOfficials of the war departments of\nbotli England and France, as well as\nof the Rrltish museum, have given\nmuch valuable assistance in the mat\nter of restoring the old fort on his\ntorically correct lines. The records\nshow that Fort Ticonderoga was a\n’star" fort, and the excavations now\ngoing forward bear out the records in\nthis respect.\nOn the tip of the tongue of land\nwhich Fort Ticonderoga was built to\ncommand stands all that remains of\nthe grenadier battery, as it is known\nlocally about Fort Ticonderoga, though\nthere seems to be no real reason for\nits being given this name. In 1756\nthe French began the erection of a\nfort on the present site of Fort Ticon\nderoga, which they named Fort Carillon,\na name meaning "a chime of bells"\nand referring to the music of a nearby\nwaterfall. In strength this fortress\nwas second only to Quebec, but in\n1759 the English had gained so in\nnumbers and the French had been\nweakened so by their campaign in\nCanada that the English, under ccru\nmand of Gen Amherst, were able to\ndrive them from the stronghold aid\nforce them from the Champlain vnl\nley. The year before Abercrombie,\ncommanding 15,000 troops, had made\nan assault upon the stronghold which\nwas successfully repulsed by Mont\ncalm, commanding 4,000 troops. Gen\nAmherst, following the evacuation of\nthe fort by the French, repaired and\nrebuilt it. for before leaving they had\ndestroyed as much as possible of the\nfortification. The rebuilt fort was\nchristened Ticonderoga and was held\nby the English until its capture on\nMay 10, 1775, by Ethan Allen and his\nlittle company of Green mountain\nboys.\nHistory throughout all these years\nhas credited Alien with demanding\nthe surrender of the fort "In the name\nof the Great Jehovah and the conti\nnental congress.” and lit this connec\ntion the Investigations nf Mrs Fell\'s\nrepresentative must piove a severe\nshock, for according to them Allen\ndid not use the choice language with\nwhich history has credited him. Ac\ncording to Alfred G. Ro.sorn, the\narchitect, who has personally * xarn\nined many records of the sun mb r\nand has talked with cb •ml ids of\nmen who were with Allen on th ■ night\nof that memorable May 10. the\n"Robin Hood of New England. \' os\nAllen has sometimes been styled.\n: ailed across the lake from Larrrib-■\'s\npoint in the dead of the night, land\n:r.g w ith his small con..non I of V!\nmen at Willow point, on the w< st\nshore of the \'ake about a half mile\nnorth of where the old Pell mansion\nnow stands G-ossing what is now\nit • garden of the old mansion he went\ndown a flight of stone stej? &; l along i\nan underground passage admitting to ,\na r ar • ntrame on the < a t side of ths\nf\nhis way into the fort proper In th- j\nparade ground Allen divided his smal ;\ncommand in\' > two parts, lining o.t i\nup at th* east acd the cth*r at th* (\nv., . end I!.\' (hen elite! • and th? -a n\nto t’r s* cor.d story of th*. we?: !-\nracks and walk\'d along th* h \\ a; |\n;:*f..r*- t:,if door he made Ms d-m *•\nhi \' . . .\nsri’EKlOl!, WISCONSIN.

The attorney general said\nthe rule applied to the children of till\npersons except those in the diplomatic\nservice and those who have expatriat\ned themselves. Even children of Chi\nnese parents may avail themselves of\nthis right, though under present laws\nforeign born Chinese can not become\ncitizens of the Fnilcd States The\nquestion arose in Marquette cnun\'y\nwhere a man born of forcing parents in\nthis country applied for a saloon li\ncense.

"It\nwould appear at first as if Milwaukee\nwere more advantageously located,"\nsaid Dr, It. 0 Sayle, president of the\nMilwaukee Medical society, for with\nits radiation of transportation facili\nties it would afford better service to\nthe public. I am given to understand\nthat the serum used for treatment of\nrabies now can be transported, and >f\nsuch is the cMMf the institute might\nbe established in Madison to give the\nbenefit of study, still giving Milwau\nkee and other sections of the state\nproper service."\nDr. G. A. Carhart, secretary of the\nsociety, does not consider Milwaukee\nat all in locating the institute. "In\nthe first place,” said ho, "who will\nyou get to run it? It would prove an\nexpensive establishment with its large\nstock of animals for experimental\nwork and there might not be a case\nfor treatment in three months. An in\nstitute, if established, should be eon\nducted in connection with the state\nuniversity. Trained men are required\nand those who would he identified\nwith the establishment in Madison\nwould he otherwise engag\'d. There\nare many men working in the labora\ntories who could avail themselves of\ntraining there. I believe that il would\nhe too expensive if established in\nMilwaukee, and probably would die a\nnatural death within six mouth - under\nthe burden of expense."\nSecond Regiment in Camp.\nThe encampment of the Wisconsin\nNational Guard was resumed July 10,\nwhen the Second regiment went into\ncamp- Many changes have taken\nplace In the regiment since the lad\nencampment, chief of which Is the\nretirement of Col Morgan who has\ncommanded It since its organization\nin 1 fifth He Is succeeded by Col\nOreutzmacher of Rlpon, who was pro\nmoled to commanding officer from the\nlieutenantcolonelcy.

They go down slowly, striking\ntin- ground with their tranks before\neacli step and never making a slip or\nn miss, although you feel every min\nute as If they were going to take\nheader Into the water. Then they\nwade or swim, as the cn o may he,\nand they swim beautifully, not hesitat\ning to cross half mile f deep water\nIf need bo.\n1 must say, however, that the sensa\ntion of sitting on the buck of swim\nelephant Is the reverse of pleas\nant. Vou fancy yourself on an enor\nmous barrel which may roll round at\nany moment mid take you under. Be\nsides that, elephants swim so low In\nthe water that you are sure of a wel\nting, which in India means an excel\nlent chance of fever.\nHaving crossed the stream, they\nI uni-t climb to the lop of Hie bank, and\n[this Is (lie nirst peculiar operation of\nnil. Down on their knees they go and\nwith trunk and tusks dig out a foot-\nIn- 1 f r themselves mid so step by\nstep work their way to the top, their\nposition being some I lines like that of a\nfly climbing up a wall.
