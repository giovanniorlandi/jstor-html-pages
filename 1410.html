most striking part of his sor\nmon is as follows\nThere she stood an apportion of\nbeauty too beautiful to be real He ap\nproached to touch her Eve was\nofcharmed no less than Adam On tho\npart of both It was love at first sight\nAnd when he touched her she was so\nthrilled with pure delight that she in\nvoluntarily withdrew and then she\nflew but not too fast for she longed\nto feel that touch
