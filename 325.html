The previous week ended with a severe\nrain and snow storm, and cloudy, cool weather, with an\noccasional light snow storm and light to heavy showers of\nrain followed until the latter part of the week, when the\nweather cleared off and became pleasant, with clear skies\nand much higher temperature. Killing\' frosts and freezes\noccurred in all parts of the state during the middle of the\nweek, destroying all vegetation that was not fully matured,\nexcept in some places in the western and northern parts of\nthe state where it was protected by snow.\nThrashing has been greatly retarded by the wet weather,\nand but little was done the past week, although most of\nthe machines started up the latter part, but most of the\ngrain is yet damp and the ground is so wet that it is almost\nimpossible to move a heavy load on it. From all reports\nreceived it would seem that about one-third of the grain\nhas been thrashed, but it is probable that more than two\nthirds of the wheat still remains unthrashed, as most of\nthe rye, barley and oats have been thrashed.\nFrom all sections reports of damage to grain in shock\nand stack from the wet weather continue to come in the\ncold weather has been an important factor in preventing\ngrain from sprouting, still a great deal of wheat is said to\nbe growing in the shock and stack.\nConsiderable flax was damaged by the recent freezes, as\nthere was quite an amount that was not matured corn also\nwas damaged considerably, although a large part of the\ncrop was so far advanced that it was not harmed. In the\nRed river valley, where the crop was behind, the most of\nit was cut before the freeze.\nBARNES—Minnie Lake—The weather has been bad for the last two\nweeks and thrashing has been greatly delayed it will take some yood\nweather and lots of work to get through before winter. Sanborn—\nThe weather has cleared off and thrashing has begun again, but grain\nis wet and in bad shape: one half of the thrashing is to be done yet.\nBENSON Oberon—Past week was very cold up to the 18th some\nthrashing done the last of the week and will be general this week\nwet weather has damaged crops some some tlax still standing.\nBURLEIGH—Cromwell—The weather haa been very discouraging for\nthose who want to thrash light showers and snow Hurries, with\nheavy frosts at night, have retarded all work: late flax not yet har\xad\nvested.\nCASS—Wild Rice—No thrashing done the past week on account of too\nmuch rain if weather keeps favorable,thrashing will be general this\nweek. Chaffee—Very little wheat was thrashed the past week\nground very soft yet frosts the 16th and 17th killed all vegetation\ncorn mostly cut some plowing done.\nCAVALIER—South Dresden -Uutil last Friday the weather was very\nunfavorable for drying out shocks, being cloudy, with an occasional\nsprinkle a few machines started shock thrashing Thursday if\nweather remains fair, shock thrashing will be general this week.\nOlga—There was rain and snow enough the past week to delay\nthrashing a few dajs the frost of Monday and Tuesday killed Has\nthat was not cut wheat in the shock is beginning to sprout.\nDICKEY—Fullerton—No thrashing done the past two weeks, and\nthere has only been six thrashing days so far this season about one\nfifth of the grain has been thrashed grain in shock and stack badly\ndamaged frost of the 14th ended the growing season a good deal of\ncorn is not ripe most of the tlax cut.\nEMMONS—Hampton -Two or three killing frosts during the past\nwaek caught vegetation green and growing as in June the full ex\xad\ntent of the damage done by them cannot be estimated, but will prob\xad\nably be greater on corn than anything else.\nGRAND FORKS—Cable—Weather fine latter part of week: two days\'\nthrashing in two weeks the cold snap froze everything in sight\ngrain is growing in the shock and shelling badly.\nGRIGGS—Cooperstown—No rain during the past week and thrashing\nwas resumed on the 18th, and is being rushed aa fast as possible\nfrost injured late flax and corn and also garden truck.\nLaMOURE—Edgeley—Rainy weather fore part of last week, with high\nwinds, which scattered the tops of stacks over the fields some wet\nsnow after the wind, which altogether was unfavorable for grain\ngrain sprouting thrashing delayed and hay making stopped.\nMCLEAN—Coal Harbor—Snow and rain of past week made thrashing\nunfavorable the fore part of week clearing weather latter part and\nthrashing has been resumed.\nMORTON Sims—Frost did great damage to standing tlax wet\nweather has damaged hay and grain thrashing will be finished in\ntwo weeks more if the weather remains favorable. Harmon—All\nfarming operations have been practically at a standstill for the past\nthree weeks on account of rains and snow grain in shock and some\nin stack badly damaged. Sweet Briar—Recent snow storm put farm\nwork to a standstill the latter part of the week was favorable and\nthiashing has been resumed.\nPEMBINA—Akra—The past week has been cold and damp and noth\xad\ning has been done with crops thrashers have been idle the whole\nweek damage to grain in shock, and also in stack, will be hard to\nestimate, but will be heavy.\nRANSOM—Lisbon—The past week has been marked by high winds,\nrains and hard frosts, followed by clearing weather no snow most\ncrops were out of danger before the frost came no thrashing done\nthe past week until Saturday. Plymouth—Heavy frost the past\nweek, killing corn and all garden truck thrashing is again in progress\nafter three days of soaking rain wheat is not damaged by rain to any\nextent very little of it is growing.\nRICHLAND—Barrie—High winds on the 11th damaged stacks ex\xad\ncessive rains of past week have damaged grain in both shock and\nstack thrashing is at a standstill. Great Bend—Wheat is about\none-third thrashed and in very bad condition too wet: lots of it\ngrowing. Hankinson—Grain in shock in good condition for thrash\xad\ning on the 18th damage by rain was loss than expected: killing frost\nduring the week, and corn that was about matured was hurt. Wah\npeton -Thrashing has commenced again, and was in progress two or\nthree days the past week.\nSARGENT—Harlem—The recent frost damaged late corn and flax\nthe wet weather has damaged grain in shock one or two grades: very\nlittle thrashing done.\nSTARK—Richardton—The anew and rain of the recent storms have\ncleared away and weather is now fine: corn and millet were killed by\nthe frosts snow protected grass from frost thrashing begun again\nthe last of the week.\nSTEELE Finley—Fore part of week cloudy and cool, latter part\nwarm, with high winds: thrashers have resumed work, but the grain\nis not thoroughly dry about one-fourth of the grain has been\nthrashed.\nSTUTSMAN— Eldridge- Rain and snow stopped thrashing all the past\nweek wheat has been damaged considerably thrashing about half\ndone.\nWARD Portal—The snow has gone and machines are at work again\ngrain that was anywhere ripe before the snow is not hurt wet\nweather has not started the crops growing. Donnybrook--Twelve\ninches of snow on the 12th drifts lasted all the week: heavy freeze\non the 12th and every night during the week it is estimated that\none-fourth of the flax crop is still uncut and that one half of it was\nunripe no farm work done the past week, as fields are und?r snow\nand water grain in stack and shock damaged but little gardens\nfroze up.\nBRIEF BIT8 OF NEWS.\nTen fishermen were drowned by the\ncapsizing of a boat in Killlm bay. near\nWatervllle, Ire.\nEJdward J.
