By and large, the editorial\npolicy has been one of conservatively\nrrenting on the day’s news, with emphasis\non constructive thoughts.\nNor is it contemplated that any de\nparture from that policy will govern this or\nany other article in this column. It appears\nnecessary, however, to strongly object to\neditorial comment in the morning Miami\nnewspaper yesterday, concerning the aque\nduct line.\nIf there’s any one project—and of\nj major importance to Key West, too—that\nhas been muddied up by interventionists of\n| one sort and another, it\'s our ajueduct line,\nj Citizen here have become so exasperated\nover *>e delays, entailing rumors of t is ac\ntion and that action, with liv. appreciable\nprogress lrmae the while, that the subject\nha.; become almost taboo in most circles.\n* To add to the general condition, high\nly-colored editorials, such as the one ap\npear.lg yesterday, with rank favoritism\nshown to one element of the issue, do not\nelp the cause. Misinformation, dished up\napparently, in an attempt to sway public\nopinion, served no good purpose, even as all\ni such articles contribute to muddy the\n, waters. *\n♦ Our policy on the subject of fresh\nv ’e> for Key West has been — “we want\nwater, and we don’t care who or by what\naction it is brought to the city”. We stick\nto that thought, tenaciously. Interference\nby newspapers, the editors of vhich re\ni ceive information second-hand, with wrong\ninformation, acts as a detriment on the\nreject, as all can see.\nTherefor, in the interests of obtaining\nthis much-needed service, The Citizen ob\njects to that article It’s a dangerous line\nto follow, antagonizing those who will help\nthe project along.\nBut, as we say above—we won’t rant\nand rave about it. Our readers prefer, as\nthey always have, that we remain neutral—\nin favor of all interests who show proof of\nj wanting to help Key West.\nA BISHOP’S STORY\nIllustrating how the treatment of\nstrangers in a foreign land may influence\ntheir lives, Bishop Bartlett of the Episcopal\nchurch tells of two young Chinese students\nwho came to America, and what happened\nto them.\nOne, a Chinese girl who had been con\nverted to Christianity in her native land,\ncame to the United States to continue her\nstudies. Unfortunately, she entered a\nI school in which preudice was shown be\ncause of her race.

The talk, as might be expected,\n’ was not backed up by an invasion and\nsome commentators in this country pointed\nout that if the Axis powers were planning\nan invasion they would not say so.\nNow. we have a definite Axis declara\ntion that no invasion is contemplated.\nThus, it appears, the thought is in the\nminds of the Axis powers and the aerial\nannouncement is designed to mislead the\ni opposition.\nTHE KEY WEST CITIZEN\n’ 1 ■ ■ By ME DORA FIELD -\nYESTERDAY: Although Aunt\nMaggie v:a* murdered :he night\nbefo r e, and someone has been at\nt cork on the puzzle all night. no\nbody has the leust idea icho\nkilled her. But the guests at\nSally\'s hovseparty are all rising,\nand Sally herself is starting for\nthe third floor to look among\nAunt Maggie’s papers for some\nthing that might explain it aIL\nShe privately thinks the secret\nroom supposed to be somewhere\nin the old house has tometiling\nto do with it aIL\nChapter 18\nGloomy Search\nI ADMIT that by then I was be\nginning to feel rather appre\nhensive about the law, for the\nconversation between Bob and\nKirk had given me an idea of\nwhat we were in for. It seemed\nto me that my only hope lay in\nfinding what Bob called a motive.\nOnce we had a motive, maybe, we\ncould find a clue.\nSo 1 went back to the third\nfloor again, this time to look\nthrough the papers Aunt Maggie\nhad left in the study. I felt rea\nsonably certain she had not con\nsidered the secret room of inter\nest except as a family curiosity.\nThis being the case, she probably\nwould not have hidden the clue.\nIf the directions it gave were com\nplicated, she might have had the\npaper with her when she went\ndownstairs. But if the directions\nwere easy to understand, she. had\nprobably left the clue among the\nother papers or had stuck it some\nwhere in her room.\nBut there were no papers in her\nbureau or desk drawers and noth\ning of interest in her purse. The\ncollection of papers in the study\nI was formidable. An old family\nBible, several volumes of family\nrecords, half a dozen packets of\nletters and a number of loose pa\npers and Aunt Maggie’s brief case\nwhich inclosed her usual working\nmaterials.\nI sat down in the chair she had\noccupied and got busy. A lot of\nreading of old-fashioned, spidery\nwriting was necessary, for I had\nno idea what the clue she had\nspoken of might be like.\nIt was slow work and I had\nbegun to feel pretty hopeless\n. when I heard a step outside.\n“Here I am, Bill,” I called.\nBut nobody answered and no\nbody appeared. I waited a minute,\nfor I knew that I had heard some\none, then got up and looked out in\nthe hall. But I saw no one. Ordi\nnarily if I had thought I heard a\n! footstep outside a room and\n; found myself mistaken I would\nhave dismissed the matter with\nout further thought.\nBut too much had happened\nlately for me to maintain any such\ncasual attitude now. I looked first\ni in Aunt Maggie’s room, then in\nall the other rooms on the floor.\nAs usual, I saw no one at aIL\nBut in Aunt Maggie’s room it\nseemed to me that the books and\nother things on the desk had been\nmoved about. I felt sure of it, for\nthe blotter was askew and surely\'\nI would have straightened it auto\nmatically when I looked in ear\nlier.\nI went back to the study, feel\ning a little too remote from the\nrest of the household for absolute\ncomfort, yet anxious to go on with\nmy search. I would make Bill help\n1 if he ever got through with his\nroad mending.\nI worked on and on and to my\nears, tuned now to hear the slight\nest sound, it seemed that the house\nwas very still. I knew that it was\nonly because one whole floor sepa\nrated me from everyone else; but\nI found myself listening for noises\nand, when I finally heard footsteps\nagain, I jumped from my chair\nand rushed to the door breath\nlessly.\nNew Helper\n1U IRK, looking very forthright\nand dependable, was coming\ndown the hall. “Bessie said you\nwere up here,” he explained- “I\ncame to ask if I could be of any\nassistance.”\ni “I was just going through Aunt\nMaggie’s papers to see if they\nwould throw any light on the sit\nuation.*\n“Not a bad idea,” he agreed.\n“May I help? And by the way\nSally. I’ve been thinking this over,\nand while there doesn’t seem to\nbe any rhyme or reason for it,\nthere’s got to be one somewhere.\nYou remember Aunt Maggie told\nus about finding a clue to the se\ncret room? Do you suppose there\ncould be—any connection?”\ni I felt my face flush. Here was\nKirk suggesting the very thing I\nhad been trying to keep quiet\nabout. I must confess that for a\nmoment I wondered if it were not\njust the thing the murderer him\nself might do. But, after all. may\nbe it was a more obvious conclu\nsion than I had thought\n“I had wondered about it my\nself," I admitted. "That’s why I\nam looking through these papers.*\n“Ah, I see. Well, let me help\nyou. Have you any idea what we\nshould be looking for? I mean,\ndid you gather from Aunt Maggie\nany suggestion as to what sort of\nchie she had found?"\nThere was nothing for it but\nto accept this offer, so I said. “No.\nNo idea at aIL Suppose you check\nthrough these. I may have missed\nsomething.”\nWe worked quietly for a while,\nthen Kirk asked, “You—you don’t\nsuppose there’s some crazy person\nToday’s Horoscope\nThe pursuits of today\'s native\n, will be ornamental and esthetic.\n,and will result in financial suc\n-1 cess.

Did you\never hear of a relative who was\nnot quite right?"\n“Bill asked the same question\nthis morning," I answered. “I\nnever heard anything to make me\nthink so, but it seems that any\nthing is possible."\n“I wondered about It when\nAlice claimed to have seen a\nghost," Kirk said. “Of course, we\nall thought Alice was just imagin\ning things because of over\nwrought nerves. But Bill ran into\nsomebody in the hall—”\nI looked at him guilelessly, but\nin my heart there was still a ques\ntion. Could it have been Kirk who\ncollided with Bill? After all, the\nstairs are nearest the dining-room\ndoor and Kirk had come back into\nthe library from the dining room.\nBut he met my glance squarely\nand it was I who turned away.\n“Alice couldn’t describe her\nghost,” I recalled. “She said it was\njust a shape.” I shuddered at the\nthought that perhaps Alice might\nhave been right That there was\nsome monster concealed in the\nhouse awaiting an opportunity to\npounce upon innocent victims.\nWhy had Bill used the words go\nrilla or hairy ape? Had there been\nsomething in that brief contact in\nthe hall which had caused him to\ndo so unconsciously? “It’s too aw\nful," I said to Kirk.\n“I shouldn’t have frightened you\nwith such ideas,” he said contrite\nly. “If Alice saw anything, it was\nnot a ghost, but something hu\nman. By the way.” he went on,\n“was there anyone who might\nnot want you to have this house?\nAny jealous relative who might\nhave wanted it himself or herself?\nAnyone who might possibly feel\nthat it was left to you—unfairly,\nand who would try to scare you\naway? Has anyone offered to buy\nit from you?"\n“But why? What would that\nhave to do with it?”\n“Haven’t you heard of cases\nwhere people tried to scare off the\nowners by making things dis\nagreeable for them? Maybe so\nthey could buy the property at a\nreduced price?”\n“But that’s too fantastic,” I said.\n“Judge and Mrs. Warren, who live\nat Roswell, did ask if I would be\ninterested in selling the place.\nThey seemed to approve my deci\nsion to keep it and said they had\nonly thought I might be selling it\nto—Yankees or somebody dis\nagreeable."\n“Yankees?” Kirk grinned.\n“It’s absurd, of course. But the\nWarrens are very old fashioned.\nAnd these old houses are rather\nin demand in Georgia because\nSherman left so few of them.\n“So you don’t think the judge\nis a likely candidate to be putting\non a campaign to terrorize the\npresent owners?”\n• “I certainly don’t And as to\nrelatives, the only one I can think\nof who might have envied me the\nnouse would have been Aunt Mag\ngie. and she, of course, was free\nto come and go as she liked. As\nthings have turned out I don’t\nsee how it could be Aunt Maggie."\n“Well, that’s that” said Kirk,\nand we both worked silently for\nsome time. Then Kirk picked up\nAunt Maggie’s brief case, which I\nhad already gone through, and\nstarted scanning the papers it\nheld.\nThe Map\n“TJj ELLO, what’s this?” he asked\nUT suddenly, a note cf excite\nment in his voice. “Looks like\nsome sort cf diagram.”\nAnd it was a diagram, with a\nline begining at the top left-hand\ncomer and meandering downward\ntoward the right. Here and there\nalong the line were names and at\ncertain points there were large\nblack dots.\nI could not help smiling when\nI saw it and Kirk’s eager expres\nsion. “That.” I told him. “is one\nof Aunt Maggie’s genealogical\nmaps of Georgia. That black line\nis Sherman’s march through\nGeorgia to the sea. The black dots\nindicate towns he burned, or at\nleast towns in which he burned\nthe courthouses. Aunt Maggie\nmarked them because it means\nthat all records prior to 1884 have\nbeen destroyed in those towns and\nit was therefore useless for her to\ntry to trace family trees through\ndeeds and marriage licenses and\nother papers which are usually on\nrecord.” -\nKirk regretfully replaced the\ndiagram., mnd I thought I had\nreally discovered something," he\nlamented. “By the way, Sally, all\nthis geneal&y stuff. Could we find\na clue there, do you suppose?\nAunt Maggie never kept anybody\nout of the D. A.

Umpires, scorekeeper and\ngatekeeper were appointed; first\nround schedule drawn; method of\nsettling disputes arising in the fu\nture agreed upon, and Christmas\npri2es for the fans selected.\nOnly remaning obstacle was\nfunds for the deposit of the elec\ntric meter to be installed at Bay\nview Park field. The team rep\nresentatives decided to divide the\nexpense into three equal parts.\nThe measely sum of $2 88 remain\ned in the treasury of the disband\ned Service and Civilian Leagues.\nTo this had to be added $12.12\nfor the required amount that was\nnecessary to install the meter\nearlier this year. The managers\ndug into their pockets and pro\nduced 54.05 each, their equal\nshare. At last, they believed\neverything was ready for the\nopening of the round-robin Tues\nday night. They soon learned\ntheir optimistic belief was\ngroundless.\nIn due time, application was\nmade at the electric company for\ninstallation of the meter. To their\nsurprise, the managers were in\nformed the deposit required\nwould be $25.00 instead of $15.00.\nThat was the knockout blow.\nOnly SIO.OO more, you say.\nYes. a small sum to be sure. But\ndon’t overlook the fact that the\nmanagers, and not the public,\nmust bear the burden of this and\nfuture expenses—for the public’s\nentertainment. That’s the catch.\n,\'The managers were wiling to\n“foot" the $15.00 expense but an\nincrease of SIO.OO carried them\ninto the ‘Ted”.\nImportant factor to be consid\nerel is that softball in the recent\npast has been a losing proposi\ntion. Games have been staged for\nthe public’s enjoyment but there\nhas been meager support. There\nfore. the managers were faced\nwith the problem of risking their\nmoney without any assurance of\nprofit, or. satisfactory to them,\n“breaking even".\nWhen the Service and Civilian\nLeagues were organized the lat\nter part of September, nine teams\nwere entered. Each club was re\nquired to post a $3.00 entrance\nfee that went into the general\nfunds. When the league disband\ned in November that total of\n527.00 held been paid out for ex\npenses incurred and all but $2.88\nof the $15.00 meter deposit used\nto satisfy all debt. Receipts at\nthe games never covered expens\nes for any one night.\nThat’s the situation facing these\nsoftball enthusiasts. They believ\ned. however, the tournament be\ntween the three strongest clubs\nwould have been successful.

You listen for the bay\ning of the hounds, which signi\nfies that they are on the fresh\ntrail of a venison steak and you\nstand ankle deep in muck with\ngnats exploring your eyes, ears,\ns nose and throat like they were\nspecialists. Then from afar you\nhear “yelp, yelp, yelp”, and you\nare as alert as a Minute Man at\nConcord Bridge. . Ten minutes,\ntwenty minutes you wait. Your\n. nerves tense—and nothing hap\nipens.
