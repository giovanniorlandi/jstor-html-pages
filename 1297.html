City Hospital\n;WAR TO THE GRIM END\nThe Speaker of the Japanese House of\nRepresentatives recently advised a mass\nmeeting in Tokyo that Japan must utterly\ndestroylthe United States and Britain or\nf. t#\nbe destroyed.\nThere is every prospect that the Jap\n-9m\nanese official spoke the solemn truth. The\ngrim nature of the global war, as he said,\n“will permit no half-baked distinction be\ntween victor and vanquished.”\nTfie people of the United States should\nnot overlook the fact that this country, and\nthe British, for many years exhibited tan\ngible evidences of good-will to the Japanese\npeoplerThe conflict that has resulted\nsprings; not from Anglo-American aggres\nsion bui from the brutal and treacherous at\ntack launched by Tokyo war lords.\nTEie statement of Takahido Okada,\nJapanese speaker, is interesting because he\nadmitsjhat “there is absolutely no room for.\nthe coexistence of Japan on one side and\nGreat Britain and the United States on the<\nother” because he says that these two\ncountries represent “cruelty and crafti\nness infiarnate.”\nTfie United States is accused of “at-!\ntempting to control Europe across the At-j\nlantic fcnd East Asia across the Pacific m 1\nan outspoken action of extreme imperil-1\nism.” In brief, action of “extreme imperial-\'\ninn.” Z t\nTEe people of Japan will naturally be-j\nlieve what the Speaker of the House tells’\nthem. They will undoubtedly be misled by;\nother Japanese officials and, consequently,\nwill imagine the United States an\nto destroy Japan. This\nis unfortunate because it is untrue\ncause fl. will lead the Japanese\ntheir djom.\nIfjlhey accept the utterances of the\nwar lofcds, as to the causes of the war, as\nthey probably will, the United States and\nGreat Britain have no choice but to accept\nthe challenge by proceeding to destroy Ja\npan as-utterly as the war lords planned to\ndestrojtthe United States and Great Britain.\nTBere are some fellows wearing suits\nwith v©*tical stripes who should be wearing\nsuits v£th horizontal stripes, if they got\ntheir jnst deserts.\nStwne of the boys of Key West have al\nready made the great sacrifice in the armed\nforces 5f the nation and their families,]!cnow\nwhat iC is to suffer for civilization.\nEftner Davis, him\nself injad irf a speech made ill Boston re\ncently,-when he criticized the press which\nin turn-criticized him.

K * •\nlimned on his braim\nUs dbnsideF only one of many in\nstances about Johnson’s memory that his\nbiographer, James Boswell, records. John\nson was handed a poem, written in Latin,\nof five quatrains, or 20 lines. His biograph\ner, James Boswell, had been given the poem\nby its author, who was anxious to know\nw hat the great man thought of it.\nJohnson read the poem once and pass\ned it back to Boswell. After commenting\non it, Johnson remarked, “Let me see if I\ncan recite it.” He recited it with the change\nof but a single word, and the change, Bos\nwell declared, added to the cogency of the\nline in which the word appeared.\nThe foundation of Johnson’s greatness\nwas hi3 retentive memory, with the added\nfaculties of knowing how to apply effective\nly the things his mind had retained.\nTwo years or so ago, many stories ap\npeared in newspapers about a man whc\nhad never done any creative writing in all\nhis life. He contracted a serious malady,\nwas operated on, and remained in bed for\nseveral months. While he was convalescing,\nhe wrote a drama, which turned out to be\na hit. He wrote another, and then a book,\nand both were successes. What effect did\nhis malady have on his mind?\nHistory is full of such incidents. Frank\nlin Delano Roosevelt showed little of his\nkeen mental ability of today prior to the\ntime he was stricken with infantile paraly\nsis. And his mind can tire out a dozen ordi\nnary minds. He is mentally alert, always,\nand he never forgets even minor happen\nings in the realm of politics and government.\nAnd then consider Steinmetz, the elec\ntrical wizard, the greatest in that field of\nscience the world has ever known.

Nobody ’cept me,”\nold Gibbs told Ann when she\nasked him who else knew that\nTerrence spring was a fake. “Just\nme.”\n"But . . . why did she do it\nGibbs?”\nHis gaze was steady. “I reckon\nshe done it for you, Miss Ann.\nFor you and Lydia. It were ’bout\nthe year you was a-hankenn*\nafter some big school and your\nmother wasn’t a-goin’ to let you\ngo and Miss Gussie says she’s got\nto do somethin’. So she did. She\nthought up the spring.” He nod\nded his approval.\nAnn was staggered. She had\nknown her grandmother’s for\ntunes changed with the discovery l\nof the mineral spring but not that\nthe mineral spring had been “dis\ncovered” by *he simple expedient\nof inventing it\nNow, more than ever, she must\nget Terrence House herself and\nclose it to the wealthy, idle guests\nwho paid to bathe in and drink\nfrom a spring that didn’t exist\nBut until then she’d keep the\nspring going. She wouldn’t let\nGrand Gussie down.\nShe wouldn\'t let the town down\neither. For no matter what her\ngrandmother had done she had\ndone it grandly and Ann would\npreserve the legend.\nShe handed Gibbs a $lO bill.\n“When that’s used up come back,\nGibbs. I—l think I can give you\na little more.”\nA little more, maybe. But how\nquickly the cost of minerals\nwould deplete her small savings.\nWhen Gibbs was gone she\nturned to Matilda.\n“yOU need to be cleaned up,\n* young lady,” she said to the\nbird but she was too preoccupied\nwith her own thoughts to try to\ngive the cage a thorough wash\ning. A fresh paper stuck through\nthe small door at the side was\nmore than the bird had had since\nGrand Gussie died. Ann was sure\nof that for no one would know\nto look for the hidden spring that\nlet the cage literally fall ap*art for\nKEY WEST IN\nDAYS GONE BY;\nFROM FILES OF THE CITIZEN\nof JUNE 24. 1933\nApproximately 1,700 fish, rare!\nand common, caught in local wa-i\nters under the direction of Hamil- 1\nton Knowles, were put aboard the\nMallory liner Brazos last night tor\nshipment to New York, where;\nthey will be put on exhibition in\nthe aquarium in that city.
