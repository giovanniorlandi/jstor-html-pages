NO. 21.\nTONOPAH DAILY BONANZA, TONOPAH, NEVADA, SATURDAY EVIiNINC, JIIV 9, IW\nPRICE TEN CENTS\nACCEPT\nCOMMISSIONERS OF\nMEETING\nPROPOSAL\nESMERALDA ARE LAX\nIN DUTY TO HIGHWAYS poliIFnt for ff\nThe county commissioners o Es\nmeralila county have been censured\nto great extent for their failure\nto take care of several important\nroads within their county, and their\nanswer seems to be lack of funds,\nbut The Bonanza has learned of a\nrecent case of utter disregard of\npublic welfare which would indicate\ntheir lax interest in roads that Jo\nnot lead directly into Goldlield to\nbe something other than a financial\nproblem.\nSome three months ago several\nmembers of the ISlshop chamber of\ncommerce made a trip of inspection\nover a proposed new route from the\nsouth by way of Mount Montgomery,\nBasalt and Coaldale to Tonop.ih.\nAfter giving the road the "once\nover" it was plainly visible that at\nconsiderable expense a new road\ncould be constructed between Basalt\nand Coaldale, a distance of 22\nmiles, which would connect the road\nnorth from Bishop to MIna with the\nFish Lake valley road running south\nout of Coaldale. In addition to prac\ntically eliminating all grades, this\nroute shortens the distance between\nTonopah and Bishop by about IS\'\nmiles. After the inspection trip, the\nenterprising "citizens of Bishop cir\nculated a subscription list in north\nern Inyo and southern Mono coun\nties In California and quickly se\ncured several thousand dollars to\nImprove that part of the road lying\nin Esmeralda county, Nevada. Not\na minute was lost, and within 30\ndays a large force of men with the\naid ot a huge road grader had com\npleted the necossary grading an 1\ntht? road was In fair shape for trav-\nAfter about two months of use\nwas found that about two-thirds\nthe new road Improved with\ntravel hut the other third, or about\neight miles, which passed over ma\nterial not so favorable for natural\nrods, broke down In places. This\nconditio.\' was brought to the notice\nof the Bishop chamber of commerce\nand those enterprising people quick-\nvolunteered to raise another fund\ntravel the ruts in Esmeralda ?\npart of the road. A wire was sent\nto the Nevada highway department\nasking for the use of a truck to be\nused In this work. Mr. Cotirell re\nsponded that the department did\nnot have a truck available, but it\nthe county commissioners could not\nsupply a truck, if they would re\nquest the highway department to fur\nnish one, an effort would be made\nto meet the request. hen this\ncondition was brought to the notice\nof the Esmeralda commissioners they\nrefused to assist the Bishop people\nby requesting trie use of a truck,\nwhen It would have meant the im\nprovement of a trunk line in their\ncounty without the expenditure of\none cent of Esmeralda money. Can\nbeat It? Must we be forced\npass through Uoiatieia over a\ncircuitous route, over three\nto reach a destination In\nMono counties, when the\nnorthern route Is so much shorter\nmore feasible? It Is reported\nthat on averaee of at least 12 cars\nper day \'are now using the new road\nand Information has been received\nfrom W. A. Parcher, secretary of the\nBishop chamber of commerce, that\nwould hire a truck and the\ngraveling will start at\nel\nIt\not\nljr\nto\nyou\nto\nlong,\nsummits,\nInyo or\nnortl\nand\nOF RAILWAY\nENGINEER\nl lly Aaaot\'lnted Preaa)\nEL PASO, Texas.

H\nGordon Selfridgo. the American nier\nchant in London, is one of the 19\nappointees.

The department has a mo\nnopoly In the United Kingdom ot\nthe malls, telegraph and telephone,\nthus making It the greatest business\nIn the country. Vet, on a combined\nrevenue of 70.ihiO.000 a year, it .is\nbeen run at a loss.

Strips of or\ngandy plcoted on the edges are\ngathered along the center to four\nruchlngs that edge the panels.\nOrgandy frocks have wide hems\noften cut In shallow scallops at the\ntop and headed with frills. These\nfrills, with picot edges, are used\nalone for decorating many frocks and\noften placed In festoons running in\nparallel rows on the skirt und bodice.\nWide, hemstitched tucks or narrower\nones edged with narrow lace ure per\nhaps the best liked of all decorative\nfeatures.
