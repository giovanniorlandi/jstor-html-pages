Mrs. Dorrill, stood the trip well despite her age of, 78 years., BELIEVES DAYS OF, WAR PRICES OVER, The peak of high prices for practi, cally all commodities, espec ally those, regarded as the necessities of life, has, passed and the present downward, tendency of prices will continue grad, ually until conditions aga n reach, normal, in the opinion of J. Frank, Jones, head of the Jones Milling Com, pany of this city., Very marked reductions have oc, curred recently in the products han, dled by Mr. Jones’ company. Corn,, which sold at $2.50 and upward per, bushel here, is now selling for $1.70, at retail. Corn chops have dropped, from $4.15 per 100-pound sack to, $3.25. Flour is wholesaling at 75, cents to $1 per barrel lower than 30, days ago., "You will find the same tendencies in, the prices of shoes, clothing and other, goods," Mr. Jones said. "The cost of, living is rapidly decreasing just now,, and 1 believe it will continue to fall, until more reasonable levels are reach, ed. While I do not look for any im, mediate reduction in the wages of, labor, I believe there is a very no, ticeable d sposition upon the part of, the workingman to\' steady down and, remain longer on the same job, and, to give more efficient and energetic, servic\'es for his pay, all of which will, be in effect more product on for the, same pay and equivalent to a de, crease in the cost of labor.”, With reference to the situation in, the grain markets, Mr. Jones believes, it is accurately summarized in a trade, letter he received today from a prom, inent Nebraska house, which is in, part as follows:, “Throughout tfye entire corn grow, ing territory, most seasonable weath, er conditions\' have\' prevailed. It is, too early to make an estimate on this, crop yet, but with a few weeks more, of good weather, it is reasonable to, expect a crop of upwards of three, billion bushels, ranking with the big, gest ever grown. Favorable weather, has helped oats materially and this, crop, too, promises much better than, was anticipated 60 days ago., “With such brilliant crop prospects, prevailing, there is little wonder that, prices have stead ly worked towards, lower levels this week, notwithstand, ing light receipts from the farms., There is not much chance for a heavy, run of corn during the threshing sea, son and the oat harvest which is just, ahead of us. But even so, we can see, little prospect of higher corn prices, so long as crop conditions continue un, impaired. In fact, the inevitable re, adjustment of prices is now under, way. War time prices are past. This, applies not only to corn, oats and, wheat, but also to automobiles, shoe, pegs and silk shirts., “With corn, wheat and oats work, ing down to lower levels, with beef, arftl pork already down 50 per cent, jfrom war time prices, the start will, have been made in earnest for a re, duction of living costs, and food prices, l must lead the way. Labor prices can, ] only be expected to follow this lead, Already higher efiiceney in labor is, noticeable which is a wholesome ten, dency towards the reduction of manu, facturing costs of all commodities., “The transportation situation shows, improvement and is noticeably bettei, now than for many weeks.’’, BATTERY PLANT BIGGER., Additions have been made to tht, battery service station of the Lincoln, Jones Electric Company so that 4C, storage batteries may now be charged, at the same time, and as many auto, mobiles supplied with service batteries, whle the others are being charged., The plant is five years old, and has, continously expanded to serve the, trade in this territory. Lincoln, Jones are now agents for the well, known Eveready and Vesta batteries,, both of which are popular with Faulk, ner motorists. The development of, the battery station gives the company, three big lines of business, electrical, contracting, the sale of electrical sup, plies, and the battery department., Miss Juanita White complimented, her guests, Misses Mildred Bowers of, DeWitt and Vernona and Gladys Ilal, brook of Plumerville, with an enjoy, able entertainment Saturday n ght at, her home on Conway boulevard. The, guests participated in a number of in, teresting games before refreshments, were served and the party dispersed., The Misses Halbrook returned home, this morning., To the Voters of Faulkner County., Arkansas:, On January 20 I made my announce, ment to the voters of Faulkner coun, ty, Arkansas, that I would be a can, didate for the office of County and, Probate Clerk., I wish to state further at this time, to the voters of Faulkm r county, that, I have been a citizen of this county, 29 years, and 1 have never held any, office before, and 1 wish to tell my, friends and voters that I am in this, race to a FINISH, and I will appro, bate your support on the 10th of Au, gust.
