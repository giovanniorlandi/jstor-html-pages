It is said thai\nthree RumLiii torpedo boats have\nbeen sunk by lire from the short\nbattel ies under the belief that they\nwere Japanese vessels. And in an\nother dispatch it is said that five\n"extra big" guns have been mount\ned on the forts, and that "they have\nbeen firing at ever- object suspect\ned of being a part of the enemy\'s\nfleet." It is, of course, very dan\ngerous to shoot at "suspected" ves\nsels when there is a chance that\nthose vessels may turn out to be a\npart of your own fleet! The recent\nJapanese attack on the Russian\nsquadron has apparently made the\nRussians fear that any ship appear\ning on the horizon may be some\nJapanese man-of-war. A few davs\nago the world was told that the\n. main purpose of the Japanese in\ntheir recent dash into Port Arthur\nwas to break the "nerve" of the\nRussians. The)\' appear to have\nbeen brilliantly successful in the ac\ncomplishment of that purjxise.\nPut the Russians are likely to\nhave nerve enough when it conies\nto laud righting. 1 ne Cossack is\nnot a gentleman of fine sensibility\nor of a high-strung, nervous organ\nization. \' lie seem. to have been in\naction, with results quite satisfac\ntory to himself.

All of\nthe other contents cf the barn were\na total loss.\nIt waa impossible to check the\nflames upon the barn and, when the\nfire department arrived, its energies\nwere directed upon the adjoining\nboarding house, The Chick ash a\nHouse.

Aft eminent\nauthority connected with one of\nthe embassies said today that Tott\nArthur was practically besieged\nand it was a serious question\nwhether this would not compel\neither the bombardment or the\nsurrender of the fortress, with its\nmen and material. The grounds\nfor this belief were stated to be as\nfollows:\nAdmiral Togo\'s sh;ps, on watch\nat the entrance of the port, prevent\ningress cr egress, thus establishing\na virtual blockade and cutting off\nthe chances of relief from seaward.\nThe Japanese troops near Newch\nwauj and other points 011 the Liao\nTung peninsula are able to inter\nrupt the line of communication and\nsupplies between Port Arthur and\nHarbin. The result is the jradrnd\ninvestiture of Port Arthur within\ntin Japanese naval and military\nlines. It will require a bold action\non the ptrt of the Russian forces to\nprevent the final accomplishment\nof the investiture and slow redm\ntion of Port Arthur."\niiUiUil f. - I V j. 114 \' 1 . .i\nSeveral Provisions of Ink ns i !v\nIndian Territory.\n1 ).--T:\nhe pastor, Rev.
