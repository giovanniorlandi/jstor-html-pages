A seriouB riot\nin connection witb tbe packing\nbouse strike occurred tonight in\nfront of a saloon : on Ada : street\nkept by Ignatz Hornatsky." Sever\nal men who were alleged to be non\nunion men were pureued along Ada\nstreet, and in order to escape the\nmob, which numbered- eeveral hun\ndred and were pelting them with\nstones, they ran into the saloon of\nHornatsky.: The saloonkeeper\nbarred the door the men bad en\ntered and refused to . admit tbe\ncrowd. They at once smashed all\nthe windows in the place and,\nbreaking down tbe doors, rushed in\nand demanded that tbe saloon keep\ner give up tbe nonunion men. These\nhad made their escape by the back\ndoor, and while the saloon keeper\nbarricaded himself behind the ..bar\nbis wife, Mrs. Hornatsky, . ran \' up\nstairs and returned with a shotgun\nbhe commenced to hre as soon as\nshe entered the room, and her first\nshot took effect in tbe shoulder of\nPeter Wisor," who was leading the\nmob. The crowd at once fled from\nthe place, . carrying Wisor with\nthem.\nHornatsky then barricaded the\ndoors and windows to the best of\nhis ability, and tbe mob, after re\ntreating a short distance, left two\nmen to care for Wisor and returned\nto the attack.\n- Mrs. Hornatsky, with her .shot\ngun, reloaded and took a position in\nthe doorway and stood waiting for\nthe mob, when a wagon of police\ncame around the corner in response\nto a riot call that bad been turned\nio.

Information\nwhich to a great extent confirms\nprevious reports of the conditions at\nPort Arthur was received today by\njunks which left there on August\n24 and 26. The most important\nstatement by tbe passengers on these\njunks who were interviewed by the\ncorrespondent of the . Associated\nPress confirms the reports that tbe\nRussians have been driven from tbe\nfort immediately east of the rail\nroad. This fort is named Rihlun-\nshan, and is located on tbe tail of\nthe Dragon Hills, along the sum\nmits of which the eastern defenses\nof Port Arthur are built.\nWben the Russian forces retired\nfrom Fort Itzshan they entered Fort\nNo. 15. to the north of Chao Chan\nko. During tbe Bights of August\n13 and 19, while it was raining, the\nJapanese attempted to storm Fort\nAntszshan, which is a strong posi\ntion adjoining Itzshan towards the\ncity, but they were repulsed with\nLondon, Aug. 2o.- The London\npapers this morning have - numer\nous special dispatches from the Far\n&ast, most-of them dealing with\nthe position or fort Arthur. It is\npointed out that the Japanese tac\ntics are very similar to those adopt\ned by General Oyama m 1894.\nEqual interest is displayed here\nin what Is regarded as the" precarl\nous position cf General Kuropat\nkin\'s forces. According to a dis-\npatch to the Daily Mail from Kou\npangtze, dated August 27, Russian\nstaff officers confess themselves\ncompletely in the dark, as to tbe\nmeaning of the Japanese move\nments and that consequently they\nhave no definite plan.\nTen dry 8 ago, feeling that Liao\nYang would be surrounded, Gener\nal Kuropatkin began to draw his\ntroops northward. Then on the\nJapanese retiring, he brought them\nback again, butcontinued his prep\narations for a retreat.\nThere is no doubt, says the cor\nrespondent, that the Russian army\nis now completely at the mercy of\nthe Japanese whenever they choose\nto attack. .\nThe Liao Yang correspondent of\nthe Daily Telegraph, in a dispatch\ndated .August 28, says that the Jap\nanese are pushing in against three,\nsides of the city, near which there\nis continuous, fighting. .A, great\nquantity of transportation has been\nsent north, leaving Liao Yang ready\nfor all eventualities.\nThe Japanese are reported to be\nadopting a new method of night at\ntack. They concentrate search\nlights on the point attacked thus\npreventing the gam-on from seeing\nanything. .\nThe Tientsin correspondent of\nthe Standard, discussing the dist\nance the Japanese are now from\nPort Arthur, declares that they are\nunable to approach nearer the new\ntown, towing to the fire from , the\nRussian shirs. The Japanese com\nmandei, the correspondent says,\nhas ordered that no shells be tbrown\ninto town, for "the sake of the non-combatants.\nThe attempt to attack the forts\nfrom tbe outside lines, both to the\nwestward and eastward, will ad\nvance from tbe north with a view\nof assaulting the forts from the in\nside.

Engineer Gates\nwho has built and now owns more\nwater works plants than any other\nman in the Northwest, declares\nthat the out-ide cost of a system\nwould be $50,000, and that it would\nbe a good investment. The state\nment is tot that of a boomer or a\nvisionary, but of a practical, sub\nstantial, well-in\'ormed expert in the\nwater works business. It was not\nmade in private, or to a single in\ndividual, but publicly, before the\nCorvallis common council, and the\nreputation of Mr. Gates is staked\nupon it. There is no question\nfhia nne ttoint. tOwit. that\niU L\' \' X \'\nmountain water is within reach of\nCorvallis, and would be a good in\nvestment. Any reasonable thing a commun\nity determines to hive, it can get.\nAs shown above, mountain water\nfor Corvallis is not an unreasonable\nproposition. It is a settled, fact\nthat it is not only possible, but\nthat it is practical and would be\nprofitable. The only question is,\nhow to get it.\nSeverjl ways are open. ist.\nThere is euough idle money of de\nposi ors lying in the Corvallis banks\nto build two or three such systems.\nIt is largely the money of smaller\nholders, who can not lend it, ana\ndo not use it. It is a hoard and\ndraws no interest.- If the owners\nnf it rmild be made to see that a\nmountain water system would, as\nMr. Gates declares, be a good in\nvestment, and give them a safe\nn1arv anri a reasonable, even a\nsmall return for their money, they\nwould build the system.\n2nd. There are solid, substan\ntial men in Corvallis who have\nmoney employed and unemployed.\nSome of their employed money is\nin enterprises more hazardous," re\nquiring more thought, more per\nsonal attention by lar than were it\ninvested in the proposed water\nworks. When they learn that a\ngravity water system is a favorite\ninvestment with bankers, a favor\nite investment with men who seek\nsatety and quietudi rather than\nhazird and bustle; when they are\nconvinced in short, that the pro\nposed system will earn them money\nwhile they sleep, and grow old,\nthey will supply the town with\njqountiou water.\n3rd. The present water company\nhas part of a mountain water sys\ntem already built. It has reputa\ntion, experience, and an established\nbusiness, that ought to enable it to\nenlist sufficient outside capital to\nchange the source of supply from\nthe Willamette to the mountains.\nWhen it learns that the people pro\npose to have mountain water, and\nno other, the pre ent company will\nput in the system.\n4th. If nobody elss will build\nit, the people of Corvallis cau build\nit themselves They can get su-\n- thority from the legislature to sel\nbonds, and with the proceeds of the\nsale of such bonds, build a system\nand supply their own mount-iin\nwater, a plan that many citizens\nIrmly believe would be by far the\nbest;\nthing, and an occasion \' that sug\ngested no delays. In all such cases\nit is better, as Corvallis knoves full\nwell, for an arresting officer to be\ntoo quick than too late. It is not\nthe purpose, and it ought not to be\nexpected that the officer shou\'d\nwait until he is shot, and then fire.\nA few instances of hufried action\nby officers would soon stop resist\nance to arrest and braggart talk\nabout a gun. The Newport mar\nshal may have been a trifle hasty\nin fiiinc. but since his victim will\nrecover, and since future offenders\nwill not talk about a eun when he\nundertakes an arrest, lynch talk is\nsilly. To lynch an officer, or to\ntalk seriously of it, under, such cir\ncumstances would give toughs carte\nblanche to shoot, cut and slash men\nat will and resist officers ad libitum.\nA LOCAL SCANDAL.\nConditions Disclosed That Require Cor\n. rection Two are Fugitives.\nTHEY OPEN SOON.\nTbe Corvallis Public Schools A Teach-\ner for the Eighth Grade.\nTHROUGH THE NECK.\nShooting Affair at Newport\nCity Marshal Wielded the Weapon.\nSeveral Corvallisites who went\nover on the C. & E. excursion to\nNewport Sunday were witnesses ot.\na shooting affair, in which the city\nmarshal of NewDort shot, and ser\niously wounded Al Reid, an extra\nbrakeman on the V. & tram.\nR"id is an Albnay man, and made\nthe trip with his train to- Newport\nthat morning, witn mm was a\ncompanion named William Doty.\nThe two were in the Reception\nsaloon, when two women entred.\nReid and a gambler named Lhis\nsell accompanied tbe women to a\nprivate room, the door of which\nwas subsequently locfcea Dy a Dar\ntender. After beine in the room\na few minutes, Reid . and Chissell\nbecame involved in an altercation,\nand Reid made several slashes at\nthe other man with a knife. Chis\nsell ran from th room, pursued by\nReid.\' Ashe passed in his flight\nfor the street, Chissell was knock\ned down by Reid\'s partner, Doty.\nReid began at once to kick and\nslash the prostrate Chissell, cutting\nhim severely near the wrist and\nabove the knee, and kickine him\ncpvpral tim-s ahont the head. Mar\nshal Beach then appeared on the\nt . . nll\nscene ana proposed to arrest n.eia,\nbut the latter stood him off with\nthe remark that he had\na gun and did n t propose to be\narrested. Then the marshal, who\nis a man of 6. went after his re\nvolver, while Reid and Doty start\ned for the boat landing. Across\nthe street from the landing the pair\nwere overtaken by Beach, and the\nlatter in the process ot making the\narrest fired, the ball from his 38-\ncalibre Smith & Wesson entering\nthe left side of the neck near the\njugular and lodging in the upper\nportion of the right jaw. ine\nshooting took place while nunareas\nof people were gathered in the vi\ncinitv to witness the departure of\nthe evening boat. Reid was car\nried to a hotel and bis wound,\nwhich is not considered necessarily\nfatal, was dressed. Chissell is ser\niously injured, but 13 expected to\nrecover. He is an Albany man\nwho has bsen conducting gambling\npames in tne Reception saioon aur\ning the outing season.

The case reached Dep\nuty Attorney Bryson\'s office, where\nmany witnesses were examined and\ncertain ugly facts - elicited. The\ngirl was Mary iwta iewis, woo re\ncently fled from home arrayed in\nher hmrher\'s attire. Accordine to\nher own statement, there had been\nrelations with a half a dozen young\n... . r\nscane eraces about town. x wo 01\nthe boys have fled, and others are\nin hidine. On account ot tne ex\ntreme vonth of most of those in\nvolved and for other reasons th\ncase will not at the present be tak\nen into the courts Statements\nthat certain married men are in\nvolved in the affair are apparently\nnot borne out by evidence elicited\nin the examination betore the dep\nuty district attorney.\nEnough disclosures appear from\nthe oroceedines however, to indi\ncate that among a brood of young\nsters coming on tnere are conai\ntions that call tor drastic measures,\nfirst by parents, and thereafter,- by\nthe authorities, if the first plan\nfails to effect a cure. A pest house\nto prevent a spread of the contag\nion seems to be as ; necessary as\nsimilar institution for smallpox\npatients and victims of other in\nfectious diseases.
