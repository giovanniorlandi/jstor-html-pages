AXJG3UT 6, 1907:\n8 1.00 PER YEAR\nREFUSES TO TRY\nCALEB POWERS\nSpecial Judge Robbins Springs\nSurprise at Opening of Trial\nGeorget vn, Ky. Aug". 1.\nJudge J. E. Rjbbins, in a writ\nten decision, which he read in\nopen court, vacated the bench in\nin the Caleb Powers case thi\nmorning. His decision followed\nthe filing of an affidavit by\nPowers, alleging that Judge\nRobbins was prejudiced and\ncould not give him a fair trial.\nThe conclusion cama like a\nbombshell axplosion in the camp\nof the prosecution and was a\ngreat surprise to the defense.\nJudge Robbins took up each\nallegation of Powera and denied\nspecifically that they were true,\nbut said that it was too late to\nmar his record aa judge by sit\nting in a case when he was ac\ncused of unfairness. He said that\nthe statement to the effect that\nhe had said, after the last trial,\nthat they were all guilty and\nand should be hanged, was utter\nly false. He said that his politi\ncal affiliations would not influ\nence him against the defendant,\nbut that he was a Democrat and\nhad been a Democratic office\nholder. Breathless silence was main\ntained in the crowded courtroom\nwhile the judge read his opinion\nand hia vacating the bench came\nas a complete surprise to the\nspectators.\nImmediately after ha left the\nbench people rose in their 9eats\nand began a disturbance, so that\nthey had to be subsided by the\nsheriff.\nRobbins eaid that the affidavit\nof Powers was unsupported, but\nthat he would not serve under\nthe circumstances. After leaving\nthe bench he asked the clerk to\nnotify the governor and the at\ntorneys retired in an effort to\nagree on another judge.\nThe defense submitted thirty\ntwo names of Commonwealth\'p\nAttorney Franklin from which to\nselect a special judge, but all\nwere refused. Most of the names\nsubmitted were declined. Frank\nlin refqsed to give a list himself.\nAn order of disagreement was\nentered and the governor will\nnow have to find a judge.\nThe trial will not be proceeded\nwith until Gov. Beckham ap\npoints a new judge.\nThe members of the legislature\nof 1900 have been summoned by\nthe defense to prove that the\ncaucus declaring Goebel gover\nnor was not legal. This evidenoe\nis to be introduced in support of\nthe pardon iesued to Powers by\npov. V S. Taylor during his\nshort regime. The pardon has\nheretofore been held invalid.\nPowers had the pardon in his\npossession when arrested.\nA MASQUERADER\nJob" Porte, Injured in Mine\nAccident Proves to be\nA Woman.\nWashington, Pa., Aug. 2\nMasquerading as a man and\nworking side byv side with her\nhusband in vasious Washington\ncounty coal mines, "Joe" Povle\nwas today discovereb to be Mrs.\nSusie Povle, when she was taken\nto a hospital suffering from in\njuries sustained in a mine acci\ndent ot Cecil, The woman, ac\ncording to her husband, Steve\nPovle, had been working with\nhim three years.

They\nhad taken a small keg of beer\nwith their effects, hauling them\nover an old timber tramroad.\nThe keg had been opened and\nleft half submerged in the cold\nwater with the.bunghole unstop\nped. It is presumed that some\ntime during the afternoon the\ncopperhead crawled into the keg\nand died. All but Strang drank\nthe beer in the evening, and in\nless than fifteen minutes were\nsuffering untold agony. Strang\nmade a wild night ride on the\ntramroad down the mountain to\nthe nearest village, where medi\ncal help waa secured, but by the\ntime the camp was reached\nBiggs, Topham, Turner and\nSimpson were dead from the ef\nfects of the terrible poiaon, and\nwhile Johnson and Willis were\njust alive, they are probably\ndead by this time.\nThe Rev Zed Cobb - assertion\nthat there are three heavens, in\nconnection with the statement of\na Georgia minister that there is\nno hell, only goes to show that\nPittsburg is in a class by itself,\nwhile there are other places just\nas desirable aa Boston.-\nYears\nIf CTTOIJ\nAFFRAY IN JACKSON\nGeorga R.

Jeter, it is stated,\nturned from where they had been\nstanding and walked in the di\nrection of the pool tables, when\nTalbert, as stated by bystanders,\nsiarted after him, drawing a\nweapon at the same time and\nwalking close up to Jeter fired.\nTwo shots were effective, while\ntwo, whioh were fired after Jeter 1\nfell, went wide of his body.\nWith the pistol still smoking in\nhis hand, Talbert ran out of the\nstore and started up the street,\nbut was halted by citizens, who\nhad been attracted by the shots,\nand held until the polioe came\nup. After being taken to the jail.\nTelbert would have nothing to\ntay, beyond he fact that he felt\nI justified in what he had done.\nI He is a shire saleman and is welt\n! known in thia territory, while hin\nvictim, who ha9 been here some\nfour months, is aiso well known\nand en j ys a go 3d reputation.\nGEORGIA IN LINE\nNegro Disfranchisement Bill\nPasses Senate by Almost\nUnanimous Vote\nAtlanta, Ga., Aug. 1 The sc\ncalled negro disfranchisement\nbdt waa passed by the senate to\nday by a vote of 37 to 6.\nThe bill will go to the house\nfor action Friday.

From the\' incipiency of\nthe fight its position was made\nplain. It felt that it was to the\nbest interets of Mississippi to\nthe best interest? of true Demo\ncracy that John Sharp Williama\nshould be elevated to the exalted\nposition," ranking as it does to\necoi.d to the Presidency of the\nUnited States. Tl e result speaks\nin no uncertain tone to the peo\nple of a united country that\nMia? issippians will not tolerate\nfreakiam in politics not all the\ntime, and neither wili they up\nhold a low demagogue who would\ncreate strife and dissension over\ndead issues. It waa a remark\nable campaign in some respects,\nand, considering the fact that\nGovernor Vardaman waa in\ntrenched behind a state machine\nbuilt up by himself during hi9\nfour year9 tenureship aa gover\nnor, with all the state patronage\nat his command, Mr. Williams\nmay well feel proud of hia splen\ndid victory. In speaking of the\ncontest, the Jackson News com\nments as follows :\nIn. many respects the cam\npaign haa been one of the most\nremarkable in the history of the\nstate. The followers of the gov\nernor were enthusiastic for their\nchampion and believed, in the\nface of all the indications, that\nhe would be a winner. Not only\nwas the governor backed by loyal\nfriends who stood by him; but he\nhad built up a powerful state\nmachine which waa smashed tu\nsmitheeren3 by the people. Mr.\nWilliams had no patronage, and\nno machine except that which\nwas made by loyal friends who\ncame to hia rescue all over the\nstate and worked in his behalf.\nThe picturesqueness of the gov\nernor and his apparent strength\nin \'the state convinced a great\nmany that he waa like Jeff Davis\nof Arkansas invincible. Hisfol\nlowera were not as well informed\nas the Williama men. and espe\ncially did they miss it on the\nrural route, which was more for\nWilliama than for Vardaman.\nThe Williams managers are more\nthan pleased with the result.\nThey have not missed their esti\nmates very far, and the returns\nhave shown beyond a doubt that\nthe Williams men have been well\ninformed all the way as to what\ncounties would go for Vardaman\nand what counties Williams\nwould carry.\n"The result eliminates Varda\nman from the politics of the\nstate: it decrees thic the negro\ni.i no longer an issue in Missis\nsippi poliiics. The atmosphere\nis considerably clarified and in\nthe future we will have less of\nhysteria in our politics and more\nissues in which the voters and\ntaxpayers are interested. Var\nJiman etaked his all on the elec\ntion and has lost. He reached hi\nhigh tide of political strength on\nThursday, Divested of patro\nnage, he will not be a dominan\nfactor in Mississippi politics."\nThe editor of The Commer\ncial as a candidate for Railroai\nCommissioner believes that h\nhas been badly defeated, but he\nwould rather have been so than\nto see Jas. K. Vardaman defeat\nMr. Williams. "Jimmy" and\nhis gang fought us, but we have\n"fit" them before, and the game\nis even, so lar as we are con\ncerned.\nTo our loyal friends who stood\nby us we return thanks; to those\nwho voted and worked against\nus, we nave no in xeeiing, ana\nwe win continue to give tnem a\nglad hand whenever me meet.\nTho number of immigrants\nwho landed at New Orleans for\nthe fiscal years ending June 30\nlast was 3.325, of whom sixty\nwere rejected for various disa\nbilities, none being for criminal\ncauses.

With some there is a dis\nposition to settle in the congested\nportion of New Orleans, in the\neld French quarter, but most of\nthem go to the country and make\ngood workmen on sugar and\nrice plantations. .\nThe vegetarians who are boom\ning Mr. La Fcllette because he\neat3 flaked oat9 for breakfast\nought to know that Early Bird\nCannon takes a slug of sour\nmashed corn every morning be\nfore he thinks of breakfast.\nLUIS IMS B\nThe Long Haired Statesman ? is Retired\nBrewer in the Lead With Noel\nClose Second.\nSpecial to The Commercial.\nJackson, Miss., Aug". 3, 11:30 p. m.\nGreat rejoicing here to-night over the vic\ntory of John Sharp Williams.

Aug. 2.\nThe license of the Southern\nrailway to do business in the\nstate of Alabama has been re\nvoked by action of Secretary of\nState Frank H. Julian, who has\ncaused to be entered upon the\nstub of such license in the re\ncords of his office the statement\nthat for violation of Senate Bill\nNo. 86, approved March, 1907,\nand effective July 1 just passed,\nthe Sourthern railway has been\ndeprived of its right to do busi\nness in the state,\n-s It is also a fact that the action\nof the secretary of state is not in\nopposition to restraining orders\nissued by the United States\ncourt of the Fifth circuit, as this\nlaw is not among those combat\nted by the railroads and not in\ncluded in any of the litigation\nnow pending in the court of\nJudge Thomas G. Jones, of the\nMiddle Alabama district- Hence,\nthe situation is not that of con\nflict of the state and the feder\nal tribunals. While it may come\nto this in the end, there is noth\ning of it yet\nThe case upon which the revo\ncation was made out came from\nthe circuit court of Talladega\ncounty in the bhape of a notifi\ncation from Clerk J. D McNeal\nthat a suit had been removed\nfrom the state court to the feder\nal Secretary of State Jul \'"an\nlooked carefully into the law and\nfound that there was nothing\nelse to do but mark the license\ncancelled, as the action of the\naction of the statute is automa\ntic.\nThe act provides that when\nanv forfticrn cornoration is sued\nin the state courts and removes\nsuch suit from the state to the\nfederal court, the clerk of court\nfrom which the removal was\ntaken will at once certify such\naction 1o the secretary of state\n"who shall thereupon immediate\nly cancel said license and make\nand enter upon the stub thereof\nan order in substance,"\nUnder Arrest Forty Years.\nWorcester, Mass,.

Peculiar.\nIt is not the play or the acting or the\napplause that attracts and holds the\nattention of the American who is at\ntending for the first time a Parisian\nopening. It la the audience. In the\nfirst place, the predominance of tneu\nIn the best orchestra seats "will provoke\na question which brings forth the In\nformation that in the majority of the\nbetter class theaters in Paris the first\nthree rows of the orchestra are sold\nalmost exclusively to men, and, as far\nas it is possible, the box office favors\nmen for the body of the house, princi\npally because they do not wear hat\nand do not therefore obstruct the view\nof those sitting behind. Before the\ncurtain goes up the stranger glances\nabout and is surprised to discover jew\nels and gowns decollete In the highest\nbalconies, the part of the theater\nknown in America as "peanut heav\nen." Both men and women, dressed\nas for a grand ball, are perched ,away\nup at least three flights of stairs, and\nduring entr\'actes they come down and\npromenade with the others and visit\ntheir friends, and few are the wiser\nas to the location of their seats. The\nvery fact of being present at an Im\nportant opening is enough to give a\ncertain social precedence, even though\nthey sat on the rafters or clung to the\nchandeliers. ,\nAnother feature which\' attracts the\nAmerican is that during the entr\'actes\nthe men who do not Join the prom\nenade stand up and don their hats the\nmoment the curtain is down, and they\nspend the entire twenty or twenty-five\nminutes inspecting their neighbors\nthrough opera glasses. There is much\nactivity In the balconies and In the\nboxes, caused by the social calls which\nare being exchanged. In the orchestra\nrows and family circles the men and\nthe women stand up, and opera glasses\nare used freely by both, and many lit\ntle flirtations are enjoyed between\nthose In the balconies, or loges, and\nthose on the first floor.\nIt is not considered rude to level\nglasses at any one, whether within a\nfew feet or up in the balcony, but it Is\nrather considered a compliment to the\nface or more often the shoulder that\nattracts such close Inspection. It Is\ntrue that the French are fatnod for\ntheir polished manner, but It Is equally\ntrue that In the eyes of an American\nthe roughest cowboy possesses a bet\nter appreciation of refinement than the\ndapperest member of the French no\nbility, and especially is this noticeable\nin a theater.

A. Devoe, U. S- Army, on the\nwork of the Regular Army in\nthe San Francisco Disaster.\nLieutenant Colonel, R. K. Evans,\nmentioned in the article is a\nMississippian, enjoying the dis\ntinction of being the senior in\nrank of officers now serving in\nthe Regular Army from Missis\nsippi. He has many friends and\nadmirers throughout the State\nwho are hoping for his early\npromotion to the grade of Colo\nnel and subsequent promotion to\nthe rank of General. It may be\nof interest to know that other\nMississippians, notab\'y, Captain\nG. W. Martin, ISth Infantry,\nand First Lieutenant, J. E. Ware,\n14th Infantry, rendered great\nassistance to the people and city\nof San Francisco in the recent\ndisaster;\nOn May 20, General Orders\nwere issued, defining the camps,\nthe total at that, time being\ntwenty-one, eighteen of which\nwere in San Francisco and the\nother three in outlying cities\nLieutenant-Colonel It. K. Evan.,\n5th Infantry, was placed in\ncharge of all the camps by ti e\nCommanding General, with Cap\ntain M. J. Lenihan, 25th Infan\ntry, as liia Quartermaster, and\nother officers were detailed as\nassistants. Colonel Evans was\nafterwards relieved by Major\nJoseph A. Gaston, 1st Cavalry\nThe sanitary arrangements\nvaried in regard to the different\nconditions. Eighteen c a m p s\nwere variously scattered through\nGolden Gate Park, the Presidio\nMilitary Reservation, and the\nvarious other parts of the city.\nThe system usually adopted was\nthat of the Reed trough and\nodorless excavator. A large\nnumber of the Reed troughs and\nodorless excavators had been\nshipped by express to San Fran\ncisco. There were no restric\ntions placed on the inmates of\nthese camps save those required\nby decency, order and cleanli\nness. If the occupants persist\nently refused to obey the rules\nto meet the above requirements\nthey were obliged to forego the\nbenefits of government canvas\nand relief stores.\nA Red Cross agent was sta\ntioned at each camp who attend\ned to the registration of all the\noccupants in connection with\ntheir proper supply of food,\nclothing, etc.\nThe climatic conditions in Cal\nifornia aided materially in the\nprevention of epidemics. Every\nday a strong fresh wind sets in"\nfrom the Pacific Ocean and blows\neasterly across the city and,\nwhile it is not cold enough under\nusual conditions to create a seri\nous chill, it purifies the atmos\nphere and prevents disease.\nWater was furnished in abun\ndance not only for drinking, but\nfor washing, bathing, and laun\ndry service. The potable con\ndition of the water supply of\neach camp was determined week\nly by means of cultures developed\nin the General Hospital.\nThere were some cases of ty\nphoid fever and some cases of\nsmallpox, but nothing even ap\nproaching an epidemic obtained.\nThe officers and men showed\ngreat adaptability and patience\nin the care and administration\nof these camps, and in this con\nnection, this lecture would be\nincomplete without a brief ref\nerence to the heroes of "Jones\ndump." About dark, April 21,\nI was stopped near the Presidio\nbakery by a tall, enrnest-looking\nyoung soldier of the 22d Infan\ntry, who was walking down the\nroad with two wagons. . He in\nquired where he could get some\nbread, said the bakery was. clos\ned and he must have some food\nHe then told me that he and two\nother members of his company\nhad become separated from their\ncommand and found themselves\nnear the foot of Jones street,\njust out of the burnt district in\nthe vicinity of what- is called\n" Jones dump," being a general\ndumping ground for that part of\nthe city. He said they , found\nabout 5,000 dagoes down there\nwho looked to them as wearers\nof the United States uniform to\nAR ARMY\ndo something for them. With\ntrue American spirit they accept\ned the" responsibility and took\ncharge. They levied on some\nadjoining stores and warerooms,\nmaking systematic issues. They\nsettled disputes and maintained\norder. Finally, having exhaust\ned all the resources of his imme\ndiate locality he had started out\nwith two wagons on a foraging\nexpedition, and he said "Those\npeople are hungry and I have\nsimply got to get something for\nthem." I took him to the Pre\nsidio dock and loaded up his\nwagons, and asked Colonel Febi\nger that night if he would not\nvisit the foot of Jones street the\nnext morning and see what was\ngoing on. He reported that the\nman\'s story was all true. The\nthree pirates were running 5,000\nrefugees, mostly foreign, and\ndoing it very well, and their au\nthority down there was unques\ntioned. These refugees were\ntaKen in the general organized\nplan later and the enlisted men\nreturned to their commands\nThis is only a minor incident in\na great field of work, but it shows\na trait in the American soldier,\nan ability to take the initiative\nand do his own thinking, which\nmay enter largely into the his\ntory of some great wTar in the\nfuture. The \'work of the army\nin San Francisco from lack of\ntime has only been outlined in\nthis paper. To the careful ob\nserver it taught many lessons\nand wras reassuring in its results.\nOne lesson is the necessity of\neliminating liquor in any time of\ngreat stress. During the first\ndav of the disaster, liquor could\nbe obtained from deserted\nsaloons, and on one street from\nrivers of wine running down the\ngutters from\' the burs ted vats of\nthe Caliiornia Wine Association\nMany cases of incidental trouble\noccurred. It would have been\nabsolutely impossible to have\nkept adequate order among the\ngreat mass of refugees, some of\nwhom were desperate and some\nof whom were lawless charac\nters, if they could have obtained\nliquor. Oakland did not follow\nSan Francisco\'s axample and a\nguard had to be stationed at the\nferry to keep drunken men from\nintroducing liquor from the out\nside. We are taught that in any\ntime of great emergency we\nmust rely on the initiative of the\nmen on the ground. Conditions\nwere ever changing. Plans for\none day or hour would not do for\nthe next. The mental poise of\nthe community had received a\nviolent shock and whereas the\ngreatest courage - and patience\nwas observed to generally obtain,\nthe crank was there and the man\nwho could see no suffering but\nhis own. D. Devine asked an ex\ncited individual from an outly\ning district if there had been\nmuch of an earthquake out his\nway. "Earthquake," he replied\n"Why that\'s where the earth\nquake was." Th9re was a de\ntermined effort on the part of all\nleaders to work together, to bury\nindividual preference and opin\nions, to eliminate personality\nand work for the general good.\nIn must not be taken for grant\ned that all this harmony and\nunity of action came without\neffort We have recently read of\na disaster where such harmony\ndid not prevail, and it is to the\nlasting credit of all men connect\ned with the administration that\nthey could not only wTork day\nand night and keep pace with\never shifting conditions but that\nthey could work together. Hun\ndreds of opportunities presented\nthemselves as trouble makers\nThev were all promply avoided.\nThe Federal, State and Munici\npal Governments were all inter\nested and represented. The army\nnavy, and National Guard \'were\nall actively at work. Nearly\nevery society in America had \'in\nterests at stake, yet through it\nall and from it all there was\nevolved a clean, thorough ad\nministration, absolutely free\nfrom graft or private gain, and\nin which the army played a\nleading part. 7 \'\nNo single complaint was heard\nin the many long hours of heat,\ndust and turmoil by an officer or\nman that the work was too hard\nor the difficulties too great. All\nshoulders went willingly to the\nwheel, and with these six thous\nand soldiers thrown into most\nintimate daily association with\n300,000 men, women and chil\ndren, no incident is known of\nfailure in duty or abuse of power.\n, Chancery Notice.\nThe State of Miaai89ippi,\nLowndes County.
