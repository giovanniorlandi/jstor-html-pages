Mississippi\nDear Mr. Rollins: Referring to\nyour letter of May 19th. and your tel\negram ot th lth. and my reply\nthereto, 1 bav plead guttty to tardi\nness In replying ta your letter, due\nto having Just moved Into a new\nhome. In addition to official duties.\nAs stated In my reply to your tele\ngram ot May 18th I believe th best\nInterests of higher general and tech\nnical education In Texas will result\nfrom a comutete separation ot the\nUniversity and the Agricultural and\nMechanical College, Tb State Is\nyoung, and both of these Institutions\nsr but In the real beginning of their\nusefulness. Also, the Stst Is large,\nand th educational fields to b cov\nered by these Institutions hav scar\ncely been cleared and opened for de\nvelopment. For a very short time a\ntingle Institution, combining th use\nful work ot both, might make a more\nImpressive showing, but for th ulti\nmate good of th State I do not be\nlieve It. A on ot th early bene\nficiaries ot th Stat, through th op\nportunities offered by th University\nfor a more advanced education than\nwould otherwise hav been possible,\n1 have watched the progresa of this\neffect ot th Rice Institute upon the\npatronage of th Agricultural and\nMechanical College, or other Institu\ntions In th Stat working towards\nhigher education. On th contrary, I\nseems to me thst the Rlc Institute\nshould hav a beneficial Influence\nupon all our blgher grade educational\nInstitutions. In that It It setting a\nstandard ot entrance and graduation\nrequirements towards which all who\nar Interested In thorough, efficient,\nwholesome higher education are Inter\nestedly looking forward.\nI appreciate your compliment In\nasking for my opinion regarding the\nmovement to separate the University\nand th College, and your own In\ntens Interest In the matter.\n8incererly yours,\n(Signed) J.
