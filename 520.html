Baron Wangenheim told Am, bassador Morgenthau in Constanti, nople in August, 191-1, that Germany, would be beaten if it did not win in, 30. days. .After the battle of the, Marne he did not repeat this admis, sion, but before the icnd of 1 !> 1 -J iJr, von Keuhlmann, in the first half of, this year Minister for Foreign Af, fairs, was in Constantinople trying to, get JVIr. Morgenthau to interest the, United States Government in offer, ing itself as a mediator.

The Allie, knew they would win. although it, might take a icnv time to do it.
