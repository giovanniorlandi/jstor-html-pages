A\nsecond Copernican revolution is underway that places humanity\nin its appropriate environmental nexus. The future well-being\nof humanity is inexorably linked to our understanding of the natural\nworld and to its sustainable management. This science-\nbacked concept is profound, with great implications for agriculture\nand natural resources management and their related en-\nterprises and institutions. Agriculture and managed renewable\nnatural resources account for >90% of the nation’s terrestrial\necosystems. The management and stewardship of these vast\necosystems along with the ecological goods and services derived\ntherefrom are huge and noble responsibilities. They need to be\nproclaimed more forcefully. Natural resources management and\necosystem stewardship must be ecology-based, including the\nhuman dimensions of ecosystem manipulation and natural resource\nuse. Until economic systems recognize the value of envi-\nronmental investments and marketability of ecological services,\nadoption of sustainable ecosystem management will be short-circuited\nby rational economic decision-making under current eco-\nnomic systems and personal values on the part of those responsible\nfor managing these lands. A variety of forces are driving sus-\ntainable ecosystem management, including science, environmental\nmonitoring, valuation of nature’s services, consumer de-\nmands, education, and others.\nSCHELLNHUBER (1999) reminds us that the invention of theoptical microscope in 1608 by the Dutch spectacle-maker\nZacharias Jansen allowed the human eye, for the first time, to\ntranscend its natural limits and see the wonders of the microcosmos.\nAnother kind of optical amplification led to devel-\nopment of the telescope, which brought about the great Copernican\nrevolution, allowing humans to view the heavens and\ntheir entities more clearly. Planet earth, after many errant attempts,\nwas finally put in its correct astrophysical context by\nCopernicus and company. Schellnhuber (1999) postulates\nthat a second Copernican revolution is underway, this one\ndriven by the many revelations of scientific investigations\ninto the natural world. These advances strive to understand the\nearth system as a whole and to develop concepts for global natural\nresources management and sustainable ecosystem ma-\nnipulation.\nPERSPECTIVE: ENVIRONMENTAL\nSUSTAINABILITY AND HUMAN\nWELL-BEING NEXUS\nHuman sustenance and well-being are inextricably linked\nto the natural world. Thus, the future of food production and\nhumanity’s fortunes are inescapably entangled with the future\nof the environment (Hails, 2002). If a sustainable future is to\nbe realized, humanity has no choice but to understand this inexorable\ninterconnectedness and manage the environment’s\necosystems accordingly. Such a goal transcends the scientific\nunderstanding of the geobiosphere. The sustainability of the\ngeobiosphere now is seen to be inseparably bound up with issues\nof economic development, consumerism, social equity,\nand international peace and security (Jasanoff et al., 1997;\nPrincen et al., 2002; Raskin et al., 2002; Raven, 2002; Speth,\n2002). The essence of a second Copernican revolution, therefore,\nis the recognition of and respect for the unalterable sym-\nbiotic relationship between humanity’s future well-being and\nthe integrity of those environmental processes (Table 1) that\nare requisite for sustaining that future.\nThe science community is on record, arguing convincingly,\nthat humanity cannot continue to harvest its sustenance\nunabated and extract resources indefinitely from the natural\nworld with impunity (e.g., Cohen, 1995; Daily, 1997; Gewin,\n2002; Jasanoff et al., 1997; Lubchenco, 1998; NRC, 1999;\nPrincen et al., 2002; Raskin et al., 2002; Raven, 2002; Smil,\n2002; Speth, 2002; Tilman et al., 2002). Likewise, economists\nand social scientists are coming to recognize the false accounting\nthat current economic indicators impose upon the en-\nvironment’s goods and services (Table 1) and the social forces\nthat drive unsustainable natural resource consumption and\nenvironmental degradation (e.g., Chichilnisky and Heal, 1998;\nCobb et al., 1995; Daily et al., 2000; Daily and Ellison, 2002;\nHarvey, 2001; Hawken et al., 1999; Heal, 2000; Hutton and\nGiddens, 2000; Lash, 2001; Masood and Garwin, 1998;\nNapier, 2001; NRC, 1994; Quinn and Quinn, 2000; Raskin et\nal., 2002; Repetto and Magrath, 1989; Serageldin, 2002;\nWackernagel et al., 2002; WRI, 2000).\nThe profoundness of this message is central to those institutions\nof higher education engaged in agricultural and natu-\nral resources management programs. The discipline of ecology,\nin its broadest sense (including the human dimensions),\nis at the core of this concept and provides a logical framework\nupon which the issue can be debated and addressed. So, too,\ncan ecology serve as a framework for our agricultural and natural\nresources management curricula and programs. After all,\nagriculture and renewable natural resources management take\nplace across vast areas of the terrestrial biosphere and its\ncomponent ecosystems. Therefore, those involved in the education\nand training of future ecosystem managers must im-\npart an understanding of the ecological basis of ecosystem sustainability\nand the inextricable interconnectedness of the\nhuman well-being—natural world nexus.\nTEMPERING THE TRANSFORMING\nAND TRASHING OF TERRA\nMaddox (2000) posits that humans, for the most part, have\nopted out of the tyranny of natural selection. We shelter our-\n', '44 • J. Nat. Resour. Life Sci. Educ., Vol. 32, 2003\nselves from the elements, feed ourselves by manipulating\necosystems and animal populations, and strive to deny death\nfor infants and adults. We have developed technologies and\neconomic systems that drive unprecedented consumption of\nnatural resources and changes to the environment. Raven\n(2002) argues that human society has outstripped the limits of\nglobal sustainability. The human species is now the premier\nagent of ecological disturbance on the planet (Vitousek et al.,\n1997), with agricultural and natural resource–based activities\nbeing the most extensive users of land and transformers of the\nenvironment (Ausubel, 1996). The consequences of these\nplanetary perturbations of ecological processes and transformations\nof the environment are well-known, including pollu-\ntion and ecosystem degradation on a global scale (NRC, 1999;\nPimm, 2001; Raven, 2002; UNEP, 2002; Wackernagel et al.,\n2002; Wood et al., 2000; WRI, 2000), disproportionate growth\nof human numbers compared with other species at the top of\nfood chains (Cohen, 1995; Maddox, 2000), and large segments\nof the global population left behind or disenfranchised economically\nand politically (Kondro, 2001; Lash, 2001; Morens,\n2001).\nIn the face of such seemingly intractable challenges, how\ncan global societies be galvanized around the goal of environmental\nsustainability in the interest of improving human-\nity’s well-being? There have been various, reasoned attempts\nto address this question (e.g., NRC, 1999; Raskin et al., 2002;\nRaven, 2002; Speth, 2002; Wilson, 2002). As an example, the\nGlobal Scenario Group (GSG), a diverse international body\nconvened in 1995, proposes that a dismal human future can\nbe preempted because humanity has the capacity and power\nto foresee, to choose, and to act as it begins to recognize the\nlinkage between its well-being and the environment (Raskin\net al., 2002). According to the GSG, the crucial underlying element\nfor driving a new global sustainable paradigm is edu-\ncation linked with the scientific revelations about the workings\nof our global village. Wilson (2002) believes people have\nan instinct to behave ethically. He envisions that the solution\nto global environmental degradation will begin with this\nhuman characteristic.\nAMERICA’S EXPERIENCE: ENVIRONMENTAL\nSTEWARDSHIP IN A CENTURY OF CHANGE\nIf strides toward ecosystem sustainability are to be made\nglobally, the first steps must occur nationally. Because of its\nextensiveness across America’s landscape, agriculture and\nmanaged renewable natural resources provide a window\nthrough which the nation’s changing agricultural character and\ngrowth of its environmental stewardship can be viewed.\nThe demographics and political character of America today\nare quite different than their 19th century counterparts. The\nUSA experienced convulsive changes as the industrial revolution,\ncoupled with immigration and population increases,\nshifted the nation’s demographic and political centers of gravity\nfrom their agrarian, rural roots to urban centers (Fig. 1).\nDemographic dynamics continued even to the end of the 20th\ncentury. For the first time in America’s history, the dominant\nvoting block in the 1992 presidential election shifted to suburbia.\nFurthermore, the nation today is better educated (New-\nberger and Curry, 2000) and more environmentally astute\n(Bowman, 1996) than at anytime in its history.\nThe character and structure of America’s agriculture also\nhave changed dramatically over the last 150 yr. Before World\nWar II, farms were predominantly diversified family operations\nrequiring full-time labor. These farms provided the pri-\nmary source of income for their family operators. Farm size\nwas limited by labor and horsepower. During most of the first\n40 yr of the 20th century, the nation’s farms totaled >6 million.\nAs mechanization became available, farm size began to\nincrease, exacerbated by expanding nonfarm labor demands,\nwhich pulled many farmers to industry and cities, resulting in\nland consolidation. By the end of the century, the number of\nfarms had decreased by two-thirds (Fig. 1) from its earlier\nzenith in the mid-1930s.\nCurrently, the number of U.S. farms totals approximately\n2 million (Fig. 1). But this figure betrays the true character of\nthe nation’s agriculture, which is highly stratified. More than\n75% of the nation’s farms are characterized as rural life-styles\nwhere nearly all income is generated off-farm. When income\nsources are aggregated across all 2 million of America’s farms,\nonly 11% is derived from farm earnings. However, commercial\nfarms (defined as having at least $100 000 of farm prod-\nuct sales and where most income is generated from the farm)\nmake up only 18% of the nation’s farms, but account for 57%\nof U.S. farmland and nearly 85% of the market value of products\nsold (Hoppe, 2001; Sommer et al., 1998).\nBecause of this structural stratification and commodity diversity,\nagriculture and its allied natural resource-based in-\ndustries seldom articulate their priorities or exercise their political\nwill with one voice. Livestock and dairy associations,\ncommodity groups, forestry, fisheries, wildlife, and other organizations\nusually blaze their own political trails when pos-\nsible, as do the various research and academic programs associated\nwith these respective interests. And while these\ngroups still ply their political and economic agendas, their\nTable 1.

These other stakeholders along with\nmuch of society now constitute a demographic majority of\nagriculture’s and natural resource managers’ clientele base.\nThese stakeholders expect more from natural resource–based\nindustries than just food, fiber, and single purpose ecosystem\nuses. They expect stewardship of the ecosystems under their\nmanagement (e.g., Bowman, 1996; Meyer, 1993, 1997).\nMost of America’s farmers and ranchers have a sincere environmental\nethic and try, with varying degrees of success, to\nmanage their operations in an environmentally responsible\nmanner. However, the American incentive-based volunteer\nconservation program model can serve up only so much stewardship.\nCritical to the implementation of these programs is\nthe fact that they must pass through the modifying gauntlet of\nindividual values and goals tempered by an economic system\nthat provides little economic return on environmental investments\n(Daily et al., 2000; Napier, 2001). Thus, farmers and\nranchers tend to pick and choose among conservation program\ncomponents and then implement only those that are compatible\nwith their resources and goals or required for program\ncompliance.\nThe tendency to short-cut the implementation of comprehensive\nnatural resources management plans is a rational de-\ncision under an economic system that does not value sustainable\necosystem management. Furthermore, various subsidies\nencourage increased production at the expense of ecosystem\nservices (Tilman et al., 2002). Despite such disincentives, it\nis a tribute to the stewardship of America’s farmers, ranchers,\nand other natural resource managers that they have been able\nto voluntarily implement as much conservation on the land as\nthey have. However, if a sustainable agriculture is in the nation’s\nfuture, then the incentives must be commensurate with\nthis goal. Thus, the natural resource management paradigms\nof the past will not drive the environmental stewardship demands\nof the future.\nREGAINING THE MORAL HIGH GROUND:\nPLAYING THE TRUMP CARD\nSociety’s expectations for stewardship of the nation’s natural\nresources provide an opportunity for agriculture and other\nnatural resource enterprises to regain the moral high ground.\nThis ground was lost during the early days of the environmental\nmovement when agriculture and other renewable nat-\nural resource extractive industries denied the scale and magnitude\nof their environmental impacts and fought various at-\ntempts at corrective actions. Likewise, land-grant colleges of\nagriculture were criticized by some for abetting this denial and\nfor their cozy relationship with commodity groups and agricultural\nindustries as well as their lack of attention to envi-\nronmental and natural resource issues (e.g., Brown, 1999;\nCommoner, 1971; Hightower, 1973; Meyer, 1993).\nThese times call for a change of perspective and focus. The\nsignificance of agriculture and natural resource–based industries\nto the nation’s well-being are not adequately reflected by\ndemographic or production-oriented indicators. As noted in\nFig. 2, these industries account for only a small fraction of the\nnation’s population and employment; testimony to their production\nefficiencies. And while these industries contribute\nbillions of dollars to the U.S. economy, these dollar amounts\naccount for only a small portion of the nation’s gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) (Fig. 2). Of course, including the value-\nadded totals of the processed products yields a larger figure,\nFig. 1. Trends in U.S. population, number of farms, and land in farms: 1850–2000 (sources: Hoppe, 2001; USDA, 1999, 2001; USDC 1975, 1992, 1994).\n', '46 • J. Nat. Resour. Life Sci. Educ., Vol. 32, 2003\nbut this larger figure cannot be tied easily to the natural resource\nbase from which the raw commodities were derived.\nBut a powerful case can be made for showing agriculture’s\nand natural resource–based industries’ importance to the nation\nby changing the indicators used to measure their signif-\nicance. Figure 2 conveys graphics that provide a strong argument\nfor the critically important role these renewable natural\nresource–based industries play in America’s environmental\nand economic well-being. As de facto managers and stewards\nof >90% of the nation’s 915 million ha of land, its renewable\nnatural resources, and valuable ecosystem goods and services\n(Table 1), the agricultural and natural resources management\ncommunity has a ready-made trump card that needs to be\nplayed and articulated more forcefully.\nMost land uses, including cropland, pasture–rangeland,\nforest land, wildlife refuges, and even much of the land devoted\nto urban ecosystems (Fig. 2), are managed by farm-\ners–ranchers and those trained in, employed by, and/or supported\nfrom institutions and disciplines related to agriculture\nand natural resources management. Stewardship of the natural\nresources and ecosystem goods and services (Table 1) that\nmake up this land’s character and worth is a huge and noble\nresponsibility. Therefore, it is incumbent upon our agricultural\nand natural resources management institutions that their curricula\nincorporate those tenets that provide the foundation\nfor their students to manage and sustain those ecosystems\nunder their control, jurisdiction, or influence. Many of these\ntenets arise out of the discipline of ecology as well as other\ndisciplines and forces that must drive a second Copernican\nrevolution.\nFORCES AND FACTORS AS DRIVERS OF\nA SECOND COPERNICAN REVOLUTION\nA second Copernican revolution in the form of sustainable\nplanetary management will require various sets of goals and\nactions if there is any hope of changing human behavior as it\nextracts its sustenance and well-being from the global environment\n(Raskin et al., 2002). There are a number of fronts\nfrom which this revolution can be staged, several of which are\nwell underway, both nationally and globally.\nScience. The scale of environmental transformations and\necological disturbance and their repercussions for human\nwell-being beg for science’s attention. Science is and will be\na major driver of sustainable ecosystem management as\nknowledge is gained about the functioning of ecosystems and\nhow they respond to manipulation. Compared with more mature\nscientific fields and advances, however, our understand-\ning of vital ecological processes and humankind’s relationship\nto the global environment is rudimentary (Harvey, 2001; Rojstaczer\net al., 2002). Furthermore, the science community is\nnot well-networked to deal with ecosystem complexity. Nevertheless,\nscience will yield an understanding of the earth\nsystem (Schellnhuber, 1999) that will eventually allow us to\nmodel and manage ecosystems in real time and at scales that\nwill foster the ultimate in precision farming and renewable natural\nresource management.\nThese science-driven advances cut a wide swath across\nmost science disciplines. Many, if not most, of these advances\nin knowledge about ecosystem functions and management\nhave come from outside the traditional domains of agriculture,\nFig. 2. Comparison of demographic and economic indicators for farm sector vs. U.S. totals and for managed land (ecosystems) vs. major uses of total\nland area in the contiguous 48 states, i.e., most of the nation’s land area and its biological resources, including portions of urban land, special uses,\nand miscellaneous uses, is managed and stewarded by farmers, ranchers, foresters, and others (sources: USDA, 1999, 2000; USDC, 1994, 2001, 2003).\n', 'J. Nat. Resour. Life Sci. Educ., Vol. 32, 2003 • 47\nforestry, and other natural resource fields. A view of the future\nin ecosystem management can be found in mainline sci-\nence journals (e.g., Science, Nature, BioScience, National\nAcademy of Science publications, and others) and those addressing\nenvironmental science and management. Likewise,\ncontemporary research and academic position announcements\nin agriculture and natural resources management are increasingly\ndemanding backgrounds in ecology, ecosystem model-\ning, geochemistry, hydrology, molecular biology, and other\nfields related to biology-based ecosystem management. As\nnew paper and electronic journals come online and new interdisciplinary\nsocieties and coalitions form in response to\nthese advances in ecosystem sciences, traditional societies and\ntheir journals struggle for identity, creditability, relevance,\nand market share in a future that promises to be more interdisciplinary,\necologically oriented, and collaborative with re-\nspect to the role of science in decision making.\nRole of Science in Environmental Decision-Making.\nThe complexity of ecosystem processes and their sustainable\nmanipulation triggers the traditional clarion call for sound science\nas if this mantra can guarantee sound decisions on the use\nand management of natural resources. But Kemmis (2002)\ncontends that we are using a century-old and increasingly\noutdated view of the relationship between science and natural\nresources management. The traditional process of gener-\nating sound science is fraught with pitfalls. Inevitably, this\nprocess results in an adversarial approach to decision-making.\nFor example, calls are made to delay decisions until more (or\neverything) is known about an ecosystem. Or worse, scientists\nare paraded to testify on both sides of a natural resource issue.\nThis process tends to obfuscate the issue, resulting in an\nimage of science for sale and fostering public cynicism about\nscience (Kemmis, 2002).\nAn alternative to this adversarial form of decision-making\nis proposed by Kemmis (2002), referred to as the collaborative\nmovement. Collaborators, including local knowledge-\nholders and ecosystem inhabitants, other interested parties, and\nscientists, determine what is already known and understood\nabout the ecosystem in question. The next step is to agree on\nwhat is not known, but is necessary to know to make sound\ndecisions. What is unknown about a complex ecosystem borders\non the infinite. Thus, collaborators need to focus on what\nsegments of this infinity need exploring, setting aside all else,\nnot necessarily as irrelevant but, corporately determined as not\nmeeting the immediate need-to-know standard. Having decided\nwhat the questions are, then science can proceed to ad-\ndress consensually identified knowledge voids (Kemmis,\n2002). The next generation of natural resource managers must\nmaster this decision-making protocol.\nEcosystem Assessment and Monitoring. Soil surveys, biological\nsurveys, geological surveys, and other natural re-\nsource assessments provide important information for characterizing\nand managing terrestrial ecosystems. However,\nthese products were not designed to assess ecosystem quality\nor sustainability. National-level assessments need to be redirected\nto include quantifiable measures of soil attributes (e.g.,\nsoil labile C, organic matter character and content, the nature\nand dynamics of soil microbial communities, degree of soil\ncompaction and tilth deterioration, and the amount of land affected\nby salt) related to sustainability of soil ecological\nprocesses if soil quality changes are to be monitored (H. John\nHeinz III Center, 2002; NRC, 1993; UNEP, 2002; Young,\n1991).\nAn ecosystem’s dynamic biotic character drives much of\nthe collective functions responsible for ecosystem health or\nquality. Ecosystem evaluation techniques must be devised\nthat can measure these ecosystem drivers and attributes rather\nthan describe their artifacts (e.g., soil morphology, total organic\nmatter or C, exchangeable nutrients, etc.). Progress is\nbeing made in this effort to identify and monitor ecosystem\nquality indicators through a variety of initiatives (Gewin,\n2002; Hess et al., 2000; H. John Heinz III Center, 2002;\nMcRae et al., 2000; UNFAO, 1995).\nValuing Ecosystem Services. Where do nature’s valuable\ngoods and services (Table 1) get tallied onto the tape of the\nnation’s GDP calculator? For the most part, these environmental\nassets are neither properly recognized, priced, nor\nmarketed. Thus, they are considered free goods, appearing as\neconomic gain without a trace of their existence or decline\nshowing up in national accounts (Daly, 1996; Quinn and\nQuinn, 2000; Repetto and Magrath, 1989). Only when these\necosystem services are lost do they become appreciated (Daily\nand Ellison, 2002).\nThe Keynesian notion that all economic activity results in\ngoods is a misnomer. Most economic indicators measuring this\nmarket activity cannot distinguish between desirable and undesirable\ngoods. As von Weizsacker et al. (1997) noted:\nMarkets were never meant to achieve integrity…or justice,\nsustainability or sacredness. If markets do something good\nfor whales or wilderness, for God or Gaia or grandchildren,\nthat is purely coincidental.\nThus, improvements in or deterioration of human well-being\ndo not necessarily correlate with GDP. Liquidation of natural\nresources and the resulting environmental degradation are\ntreated as income. Costs related to crime, medical treatment,\nsocial breakdown, natural disasters, terrorism, and environmental\nrepair are all added into the GDP. This summation, in-\ncongruous as it seems, occurs because the currently defined\nGDP is tallied on the country’s economic calculator that has\nno subtraction key (Cobb et al., 1995).\nUnder such false accounting, it should come as no surprise\nthat unsustainable management of biological ecosystems will\nbe inevitable (Daily, 1997). However, marrying ecology to\neconomics and social values dramatically changes the calculus\nof conservation and sustainable natural resources man-\nagement (Quinn and Quinn, 2000). Consummating this marriage\nhas the potential for many farmers, ranchers, foresters,\nand other natural resource managers to receive payback for environmental\nimprovements and to market ecological services\ngenerated by stewarding the ecosystems under their management.\nTable 2 illustrates a possible future scenario where a\nmore holistic market assigns economic value to ecological\nservices and other benefits.\nAssuming that Draconian changes in economic systems are\nnot forthcoming, Quinn and Quinn (2000) make the case that\na sustainable environment can be approached within existing\neconomic systems. Environmental improvement markets have\noperated in Europe for some time and these markets in the\nUSA are already in the neighborhood of $200 billion per\nyear. Economic assessments of ecosystem services have been\n', '48 • J. Nat. Resour. Life Sci. Educ., Vol. 32, 2003\ndone for a variety of U.S. environments (Chichilnisky and\nHeal, 1998; Daily, 1997; Heal, 2000). Efforts are also well underway\nto forge more meaningful measures of national indi-\ncators of human well-being (Cobb et al., 1999; Daily et al.,\n2000; Daily and Ellison, 2002; Daly, 1996; Hawken et al.,\n1999; Masood and Garwin, 1998; NRC, 1994). It is becoming\nclear that continued use of the GDP as an indicator of\ngrowth or public good is no longer a sufficient goal for a\ngreat nation, nor one that America and its natural resources can\ncontinue to endure (Cobb et al., 1995).\nRole of Consumers and the Private Sector. Society continues\nto rank environmental stewardship as a valued goal\n(Bowman, 1996). But much of this societal support, particularly\namong those with strongly held environmental values, has\nbecome fragmented among a variety of specific interests and\norganizations. These interests range from conservation and\nspecifically defined sustainable systems to animal rights, saving\nthe family farm, anti-industrial agriculture, and other is-\nsues. Nevertheless, society’s increasing ecological awareness\nis a strong asset that, when allied with other drivers of natural\nresources stewardship, can sustain the trek toward envi-\nronmental responsibility.\nIn strong market-oriented economies like the USA, consumers\nare exercising their market muscle, demanding prod-\nucts produced under practices and systems that are as ecologically\nbenign and socially acceptable (valued) as possible.\nThe marketplace has signaled its recognition of this demand.\nEnvironmentally friendly products include dolphin-safe tuna,\nSalmon Safe labels for Pacific NW farms with production\nplans that contribute to stream ecosystem health, Bird Friendly\ncoffee (shade grown vs. plantation produced), organic foods,\nand wood and paper products produced under certified environmental\nstandards. Manufactured goods designed for the en-\nvironment are increasingly meeting a variety of environmental\nand socially accepted standards (Hawken et al., 1999;\nHeal, 2000).\nConsumer demands for sustainably produced products and\nservices must be delivered through the harvest and management\nof ecosystems, processed through the cogs of industry\nto facilitate utility (thus adding value), and transacted into markets\nby business. Therefore, the transition to sustainability re-\nquires full cooperation between these private sector entities\nand facilitators, such as environmental scientists and others\n(Daily and Walker, 2000). This transition has already manifested\nitself through such initiatives as green and socially re-\nsponsible mutual funds, development of metrics for sustainable\nperformance, trading of ecological service credits (e.g.,\ncarbon sequestration credits), industries seeking competitive\nadvantage through superior environmental performance, commitments\nto zero waste and reductions in greenhouse gas\nemissions (e.g., DuPont, Shell, BP Amoco, Alcan), and other\napproaches by the private sector to deliver a more sustainable\nfuture (Daily and Walker, 2000; Hawken et al., 1999; Hutton\nand Giddens, 2000; Levin, 1999; Myers, 1999; Richards,\n1997; Sasserville et al. 1997; Speth, 2002; Wilson, 2002).\nRole of Government and Nongovernmental Organizations\n(NGOs). Despite consumer demands and corporate\ncompliance, industrial altruism has its limits. With increased\nglobalization and multinational corporations, the roles and capacities\nof governments to influence the management of nat-\nural resources have diminished according to Daily and Walker\n(2000). Of the 100 largest economies in the world, only half\nare nation states, the other half being corporations. Thus, the\nworld and our daily lives are no longer presided over solely\nby governments. Cultural character, social mores, value systems,\nmarket trends, and scientific endeavors are increasingly\ndetermined by corporate conductors (Hutton and Giddens,\n2000; Myers, 2000).\nWho else should have their hands on the rudders with\nthese company captains to help steer their corporate catamarans\nthrough the shoals of shallow stewardship toward the safer\nseas of sustainability? In addition to whatever regulatory constraints\ngovernments impose on these global corporate enti-\nties, the last quarter century has seen the emergence of many\nNGOs with both clout and currency in constraining and guiding\ncorporate and public actions in the environment. In 1975,\nthere were about 1400 NGOs worldwide; in 2000, there were\nwell over 30 000. Many of these NGOs have global reach, able\nto deploy much muscle in the marketplace (Myers, 2000).\nCoalitions of NGOs with industry and corporate councils are\ntrending toward cooperative engagements to achieve environmental\nstewardship (Daily and Walker, 2000).\nFor the most part, governments lack the will to act boldly\nwith respect to sustainable environmental management. There\nare no Environmental Sustainability or Endangered Ecosystem\nacts to bolster environmental visibility and engender le-\ngitimacy to addressing and funding sustainable environmental\nmanagement. Government programs are piecemeal, tar-\ngeted to specific issues, and fragmented among agencies. Because\nof this governmental malady, Wilson (2002), like the\nGSG (Raskin et al., 2002), argues that alliances of scientists,\nNGOs, the wealthy, and religious organizations will take the\nlead in global conservation and sustainable natural resources\nmanagement. The Nature Conservancy alone is raising $1\nbillion to buy land for nature reserves, having already acquired\n4.7 million ha (Wilson, 2002). Such initiatives beg the question\nof whether soil and water conservation and sustainable en-\nvironmental management could be pursued through coalitions\nwith the major buyers and processors of agricultural and\nrenewable natural resource products.\nTampering with Tradition:Conflict in the Countryside.\nAs science unleashes greater understanding about environmental\nprocesses and how to manipulate and sustain them, the\nTable 2.

Nat. Resour. Life Sci. Educ., Vol. 32, 2003 • 49\napplication of these sustainable strategies will play out in a socioeconomic\ncontext. Tensions must be expected between\nthose tied to tradition and those treading toward unfamiliar futures.\nThe central theme in the history of American agricul-\nture and natural resources management has been the interplay\nbetween agrarian traditions and the inexorable drive toward\nmodernization and industrialization (Meyer, 1993).\nLike most industries, agriculture has become more specialized,\nconsolidated, and industrialized to attain greater\nscales of economic efficiency while simultaneously providing\nproducts and production systems for a variety of niche markets\nand specific consumer demands. Among the many chal-\nlenges in promoting sustainability across the land will be the\ndevelopment of strategies and technologies that are environmentally\nsustainable, economically feasible, and socially ac-\nceptable across this spectrum of production systems. Still, the\ndrive to extract ever more production from the land is not likely\nto wane since land (along with labor) is a major capital cost\nacross most agricultural systems. Advances in plant and animal\ngenomics, technological innovations, and new uses for bi-\nological products, coupled with population pressure in the developing\nworld, will put even greater demands on our national\nand global soil and land ecosystems (Tilman et al., 2002).\nOne of the tenets of ecology, with which every farmer and\nland user is familiar, is “everything cannot be done equally\neverywhere” (Bouma, 1994). Soils and ecosystems vary in\ntheir capacities to produce crops as well as their capabilities\nto assimilate production inputs and waste loads. And ecosystems\nvary in their vulnerability to leak polluting runoff and per-\ncolates into the environment. Yet our nation’s constitutional\nprotections of individual rights in land ownership and use result\nin a dichotomy that has been a bane to conservationists\nand environmentalists. This dichotomy exists because constitutional\nprotections of property owners (e.g., to use and\nmanage their property in a variety of ways regardless of the\nland’s capacity to accommodate these uses without environmental\nimpacts) do not recognize this ecological tenet, except\nwhere experience and case law have established some limits\nto incompatible ecosystem uses (e.g., flood plains, health and\nbuilding codes). Environmental and land use legislation has\nalready become embattled in conflicts between landowners,\nenvironmentalists, and land use planners over property rights,\nindividual freedoms, and what constitutes the public good.\nBut as landscapes become more populated and intensively\nmanaged, a clash of what constitutes the public interest (e.g.,\nprotection of endangered species, unique ecosystems, and\nvistas; designating and protecting prime farmlands as undeveloped\nagricultural preserves) and individual rights is in-\nevitable. Agriculture and renewable natural resource–based industries\nare in the cross-hairs of this clash because of their ex-\ntensive and visible land requirements and increasingly intensive\nproduction systems. These extensive land use industries\nwill have to operate within increasingly fragmented landscapes\npopulated with both farm and nonfarm neighbors hav-\ning strong sets of values and traditions and limited tolerances\nfor change and modern, highly concentrated industrialized\nproduction systems. While progress is being made at the state\nand local levels to mediate these issues (e.g., American Farmland\nTrust, 1997), society has great interest (and clout) in\nhow the impacted parties will negotiate this sociopolitical\nthicket because of society’s expectation that stewardship and\nsustainable ecosystem services should be delivered as a public\ngood from these privately owned lands.\nFormalizing the Concept of Sustainability Via Education.\nDespite increased environmental consciousness among\nthe nation’s citizenry, many scientists (e.g., Daily, 1997)\nlament the lack of societal understanding about the human\nwelfare–nature nexus. Such public ignorance of this concept\nis a hindrance to the implementation of policies designed to\nsafeguard the earth’s life support systems. If a sustainable future\nis to come to fruition, then this educational challenge must\nbe addressed through the nation’s formal education system\n(Orr, 1994; Lubchenco, 1998). Ecology, being an integrative\nscience, has tremendous potential to provide a communication\nbridge between science and society (Odum, 1997) as well as\nserve as a framework for curriculum building.\nThe essence of agriculture and renewable natural resources\nmanagement is the capture of solar energy via the photosynthetic\nprocess and the manipulation of nutrient stocks, stresses,\nand ecosystems. As Vasey (1992) noted, agriculture and renewable\nnatural resources management are cultural behaviors\ninvolving the management of organisms and ecosystems subject\nto the laws of the physical and biological universe. In ma-\nnipulating ecosystems, we bend these laws toward our ends\nbut must ultimately succumb to their bounds.\nHigher education’s programs in agriculture, range science,\nforestry, and other renewable natural resources management\nare crucial to the development of curricula anchored to the conceptual\nframework of ecology, ecosystem management, and\nsustainable development. For it is these institutions that educate\nand develop the human capital which is largely respon-\nsible for managing or advising those manipulating most of the\nnation’s and planet’s ecosystems. Science has clearly articulated\nthe common conceptual theme linking human well-\nbeing to sustainable ecosystem and natural resources management.\nEcology is at the core of this connection. Yet, it has\nbeen my experience at three land-grant institutions and through\nprogram reviews of nearly a dozen others that these agricultural\nand natural resources management institutions have a\nlong way to go in adopting such a thematic core across their\ncurricula. While there are many excellent environmental science\nand education programs and environmentally oriented\ncourses, it can be argued, based on personal experience\nthrough student exit interviews, student discussions during\nprogram reviews, and curriculum development discussions\namong faculty, that most students in the traditional agriculture\nand natural resources disciplines outside these environmental\nscience programs do not have a common ecology-based\nframework upon which their majors are designed.\nIt is time to shift the basic mission of traditional agricultural\nand natural resources institutions from focusing largely\non production efficiencies to a more holistic mission of sustainable\nland–ecosystem management (Brown, 1999; Meyer,\n1998). Ironically, this admonition was made to higher education\nin the 1960s by Dr. Charles Kellogg (Kellogg and Knapp,\n1966) but went unheeded. It is not that these institutions\ndownplay, let alone abandon, the concepts and enterprises of\nproduction agriculture, timber harvest, fish harvest, and other\nrenewable natural resources extractive industries, but that\nthey broaden their mission toward sustainably stewarding the\nnation’s ecosystems under the management of their graduates\nand other stakeholders. If a national and global sustainable fu-\n', '50 • J. Nat. Resour. Life Sci. Educ., Vol. 32, 2003\nture is to occur, the most extensive manipulators of the terrestrial\nbiosphere must lead the way toward an ecology-based\nmanagement paradigm.\nEPILOGUE\nWith a world awash in problems, two profound perils stand\nout in humanity’s quest for a peaceful and sustainable future.\nBoth impact the environment. First is the danger to world\npeace. In a statement issued by more than 100 Nobel laureates\n(Kondro, 2001), these signatories state: \nThe most profound danger to world peace in the coming\nyears will stem not from the irrational acts of states or individuals\nbut from the legitimate demands of the world’s\ndispossessed… If, then, we permit the devastating power\nof modern weaponry to spread through this combustible\nhuman landscape, we invite a conflagration that can engulf\nboth rich and poor.\nGlobal social order cannot long endure six-plus billion people\nwho are partly rich and mostly poor (Serageldin, 2002).\nMost of the planet’s population lives at a level of privation the\nWestern world would not accept (Morens, 2001). The social\nand environmental repercussions of such a conflagration triggered\nby enflaming those dispossessed billions would be im-\nmense.\nThe second peril is humanity’s propensity to procreate and\npursue its well-being through tapping the planet’s environmental\ngoods and services, oblivious to the processes that un-\ndergird the renewable natural resource bounty upon which our\nsustenance and well-being depend. Humanity has no choice\nbut to recognize the inexorable linkage between sustainable\necosystem management and its future well-being and behave\naccordingly. To choose otherwise is to continue on a path of\nunprecedented natural resources consumption, environmental\ndegradation disguised by current economic indicators, and\nsocietal suffering and upheaval. These conditions will continue\nto fuel the first peril in the form of hatred toward the rich world,\nthe consequences of which have already been visited upon its\nmembers (Lash, 2001).\nA significant step can be taken toward addressing these perils\nby instituting sustainable ecosystem management across\nthose vast areas of the earth committed to agriculture, grazing,\nforestry, and the management of other renewable natural\nresources. In the USA and many other nations, institutions and\ninfrastructure already exist to pursue paradigms of sustainable\necosystem manipulations. Global peace and the sustainability\nof human well-being are not choices among options for the\nfuture. Agriculture and renewable natural resource management\ncan lead the way to a second Copernican revolution that\ncan do much to enrich the human condition and rescue many\nfrom the cusp of a future committed to poverty and misery and\ndriven to environmental abuse out of necessity. But as Diamond\n(2002) reminds us uncomfortably, providing more food\nand natural resources to undernourished, poor millions is\nlaudable only if simultaneously tied to efforts to reduce our\nnumbers and excessive, unsustainable drawdown of the\nplanet’s natural assets.\nTrying to see the future through lenses tinted by the tyranny\nof ignorance about humanity’s relationship to the natural\nworld, blurred by the hubris of our attainments, and misaligned\nby false accounting of nature’s assets, it is often dif-\nficult to discern what is vital from what is pretentiousness. But\ndiscern we must. An old saying, attributed to the Chinese, puts\nit well:\nMan—despite his artistic pretensions, his sophistication,\nand his many accomplishments—owes his existence to a\nsix-inch layer of topsoil and the fact that it rains.\nREFERENCES\nAmerican Farmland Trust. 1997.
