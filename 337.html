        <pre>["[THE DAILY SENTINEL, VOL. 7., OOM PAUL IN CAMPAIGN, Democrats Will Take Advantage, of Visit of Boer Peace Com, missioners., Chicago, May 6—A special from Wash, ington to the Times-Herald says:, Republican leaders here are scenting, trouble in the coming of the Boer peace, commission, which today sailed from, Rotterdam for New York. It is appar, ent to them that a vigorous effort is to, be made by the democrats to capitalize, the South African war in the coming, campaign., Already Mr. Bryan’s chief supporters, in the senate are preparing the ground, for this very peculiar scheme of politics., By the time the Boer envoys get here the, plans of the democrats will be ready for, further operations., Senator Tsller’s resolution introduced, Thursday, is a part of the program., That resolution, in a ciroumspect moder, ate way, declares American sympathy, with the struggling people of the South, African republics. Nothwithstanding, the fact that the senate a few days ago, voted not to take up a similar resolution, introduced by Mr. Pettigrew, it is un, derstood the Teller resolution is to be, pressed to a vote at the earliest oppor, tunity., The democratic leaders and other, Bryanites will insist upon a full discus, sion of the question, and it is hoped that, the speeches made in the debate will, serve to tire the popular heart with a re, newal of the sympathy for the Boers and, that the vote, when finally taken, will, conclusively show that the republican, party is opposed to the Burghers and a, friend to England., Tornado Season Has Opened., Kansas City, Mo., May 6. —Half a, dozen district tornadoes occurred in cen, tral Kansas this afternoon following a, day of exceedingly high temperature., Two people are known to have been kill, ed and* three injured.

Helfrich, wife and, child were badly hurt., The storm next struck a farm further, in the country and numbers were report, ed killed or injured., Omaha, May 6.—A special to the Bee, from Beaver City, Neb., gives lurther, details of the Wilsonville tornado. Many, farm houses were destroyed. Hailstones, as large as base balls were driven, through the roofs. The twister appear, ed after the bombardment and took a, northeasterly course. It was funnel, shaped and did damage over a large area., Farmers west and north of Wilsonville, are the greatest sufferers., Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, Washington, May s.—Secretary Hay, and Lord Pauncefote, the British am., bassador, today signed a treaty extend, ing for seven months from August sth, next, the period of time allowed for the, Hay-Pauncefote canal treaty. This ex, tension was arranged for in view of the, conviction that no legislation upon the, treaty can be secured during the present, session of Congress., The extension will prolong the period, allowed for the exchange of ratifications, until the expiration of President McKin, ley’s term of office., His Illness Critical., Denver, May, 6.—Former United, States Senator N. P. Hill has been very, ill at his home, Fourteenth and Welton, streets, since early last week. Wednes, day night his condition was alarming,, but Friday RDd yesterday he rested eas, ier.

Slocomb, Cash Hardware, j, DAILY SENTINEL., LEE ft BUNTING, Proprietor*., I. If. Hunting, Editor and Manager, The Standard Oil octopus has, declared its second dividend already, this year. This is occasioned by, the three cents per gallon rise on, all oil consumed by the poor of the, country., Russia regulates the price of oil, sold by the StandarJ Oil company., Autocratic Russia in this instance :, has more consideration for the wels, fare of the poor than has this, country., An admirable answer to the pie, eaters who are continually inquir, ing as to the means of William ], Jennings Bryan’s support Is given, by the great newspaper correspon, dent, Creelman. About ftß,ooo per, year is earned by Mr. Bryan as a •, lecturer, and as he has no debts to, be paid by his friends, as William, McKinley had, he readily supports ,, his family and supplies his small, wants from these earnings. I, ■■ - i, If the republican national plat, form contains nothing favorable to, bimetallism or if it should contain ., the subterluge of the ’96 platform, (, will Ed Wolcott have the supreme, assurance to assure the silver forces ., that, the hope ot silver lies alone, with the republican party? He has, played this scheme to cover his, falsity to silver, relying for a back, ing for his utterances on the old (, platform, but can he have the su- ,, perh gall to continue to pose before, Golorado people, if the national ,, declaration of his party is unfavor, able to bimetallism in any form. ;, Eminent financiers and publicists ;, charge India’s appalling famine to (, the closing of the Indian mints. It, is not lack ot food stufls, but more, money to purchase it with, which ,, has caused the famine. Silver has (, been the peoples moneyfor genera- (, tions in India, gold is the money (, of the creditor. The latter metal, has accumulated in the hands of, the wealthy and the poor starve., The decadence of the Roman em, pire was caused by the concentia, tion of wealth. It is not improb, able by any means that India could, follow Roman decadence, the fam, ine being the forerunner., All the conflicting elements, against Biyan in his last campaign, have been harmonized and are now, supporting his candidacy. There, is one notable exception his su, preme exclusiveness, Grover Cleve, land. Pingree the most powerful, personal force in Michigan politics;, Jones who hai proven himself a, leader and friend of the eommon, people; Gorman, Hill, Croker and, leaders everywhere, forming a, phalanx formidable and aggressive, which must improve Bryan's, chances greatly. Democracy will, worry little over what Cleveland, will or will not do. His influence, is circumscribed to a small contin, gent of democracy’s forces. He,, if his acts and words are to render, judgment upon his wishes much, prefers republican success with the, gold standard to a success for, democracy which carries with it, bimetallism., WILL DO JUSTICE., It is the belief of the public gen, erally that the present membership, of council, will do justice to En, gineer Crosby, however much they, may be hounded to do him injus, tice by nincompoops, political, trucklers and personal and political, enemies of the gentleman., The majority of the councilmanic, board are men of businese, whose, integrity in business life is and has, been unimpeachable. While to a, degree under obligations in a poli, tical sense to some men who have, acted in politics in their behalf,, their larger obligation is to do, right., A reliable business man has no, hesitation in rendering judgment, upon the right or wrong of a busi, ness transaction, where his own, business is concerned, even though, the judgment may be adverse to, his own profit. If his acts are thus, guided in his own behalf, it is to be, presumed beyond a question that, in rendering correct and truthful, judgment where the interests of the, city are at stake he will do likewise., If the contract is legal, it is the, best possible reason why Mr., Crosby should be treated justly., If the contract be illegal, per, sonal denunciation will avail noth- 1, ing, the law will enforce the rights, of the city., If the payment is excessive, it is 1, a matter easily proven by testi, mony, but cannot be proven sim- 1, ply by denunciation, personal and, public., City Attorney Staley is most, capable of determining the validity, of the contract between the city and :, Mr. Crosby. Mr. Staley has the, record before him. He will not say ■, Mr. Crosby’s contract is invalid or ,, illegal, if it is not, because Mr., Staley has regard for his profes- (, sional reputation, before any other j, consideration, be it personal or |, political. |, To simply force matters with Mr., Crosby is admittedly unfair. It, cannot fail to embarass the progress, of the important work now in, course of construction. As he has, begun the work, outlined the plans, 1, made the surveys, calculations,, ground plans and drawings on, work now finished, it would jeop, ardize the whole work to displace, him, without securing the grades,, drawings, etc., under which the, work has been done., It is not for Mr. Crosby’s sake, particularly that the people appeal, to council to act slowly and justly,, but for the sake of the work under, construction, for the welfare of the, city’s interests, which must be ad, mitted are unquestibnably antago, nized by harrassment at this stage, of the work., It would satisfy the people great, ly, possibly benefit the city im, measurably, if the testimony of, some engineer, other than the, knowa partisans of either side in, this matter, would state openly, whether six per cent, on contract, price is excessive considering the, magnitude of the work., To all temptations to abandon, silver Bryan has given an unalter, able refusal. Consistency is this, great commoner's most powerful, hold on the people. The republic, an press has swallowed all its pre, dictions made of him, the most, notable of which, that tha approach, ing elections would find him a, “has been,’’ being the most promi, nent and most wshed for consum, mation of their hopes. That he is, greater, stronger, more beloved, than ever startles and annoys them, and upsets the predictions of their, most sanguine and astute leaders., A Standard Oil magnate asserted, to a Danish envoy, attempting to, negotiate the sale of the Danish, West Indies, that he controlled the, votes of twenty-six U. S. senators., This story seems improbable., However, the oil magnate effectual, ly blocked the purchase of the, islands, proving his boast. If the, government is so utterly in the, control of the oil trust, it might be, better to dipose of the country, entirely., ARE AFTER THE HEALERS, Post Office Department Will Not, Allow Them to Use the, Mails., New York, May 5. —A special, to the world from Washington, says:, Divine healers have oome un, der the ban of the poetoffice de, partment and in a few days an, order will be issued debarring, them from the use of the mails., The department has been gath, ering information regarding their, methods for a month and it is, now so well conceded that their, business is illegitimate that it is, the purpose to institute a general, raid., The matter wns first brought, to the attention of the depart, ment by complaints from Nevada,, Missouri, where Weltmer, a so, called divine healer condueting, his business by mail, endeavored, to collect payment for continuing, to treat a patient after the patient, was dead. Further investigation, showed that he had attempted on, several instances, although of, course, he was not aware that the, subject of his “absent treatment”, had succumbed to disease., Prof. A. S. Weltmer is presi, dent of the American School of, Magnetic Healing which is locat, ed in Nevada, Missouri, and or, ganized under the laws of that, state. He claims to have treated, 53,000 patientß without personal, consultation and to have cured, all but twelve., The postal authorities have no, tified the officials of the Nevada, school to appear on May 12 and, submit arguments to show why a, fraud order should not be issued, against them., If you nood a good pair af spectacles, see Dr. Walpole, the eye man., Middle of the Roaders., Cincinnati, May 6.—The advance, workers ot the national convention ot the, Middle-of-the-Road populists which, meets here Wednesday afternoon arrived, today. They are all oppesed to fusion, and almost everything else that has any, connection with the other political par, ties. They all claim they represent a, large majority of the People’s party and, that the convention at Sioux Falls will, contain a minority of the delegates, as, over two-thirds of the delegates were in, structed by their states for the Cincin, nati convention which will keep in the, middle of-the-road and cannot be side, tracked in the interest of anybody or any, party., t One Hundred ], ► UP-TO-DATE «, l LIGHTNING i, HCE mm FREEZERSi, ► To be sold cheaper than our competitors «, » purchase them at.
