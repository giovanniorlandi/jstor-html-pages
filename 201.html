Integrating the potential of technologies in cultural heritage \nmanagement practices, particularly in the field of ‘heritage documentation’, presents a way to empower both experts and non-experts \nwith tools to better understand and record CH assets. It also allows to use research to advance on conservation, and to create and \nstrengthen links between communities and their heritage. To achieve these in a non-formal context, a learning process/path needs to \ngo beyond merely taking the contents out of the classroom; it requires the development of a strategy where students interact directly \nof the heritage assets, the communities and the institutions during a continuous amount of time, allowing for immersion, meaningful \nexperience, and dialogue.  \nIn 2018, under coordination of the University of Lisbon and Tampere University of Technology, took place the International \nSummer School ‘Unveiling the Hidden Hamina’, in Finland. The course was focused on integrating a non-formal academic course \non Heritage documentation with a community-centred approach to cultural heritage. Its primary goals were to develop a learning \npath merging communities and course contents, to tackle current challenges in Heritage documentation, and to solve some current \nproblems identified by local CH institutions. This paper provides a description of the course program and learning activities, the \ncommunity engagement strategies, the integrated socio-cultural agenda and the main outcomes obtained by the course. \n \n \n \n \n* Corresponding author \n1. UNVEILING THE HIDDEN HAMINA \n1.1. Introduction \nThe relevance of non-formal education in both human and \ntechnological oriented courses, has been well assessed and \ndistinguished as individual and collective competence maker \n(Fernandez and Fenandez, 2009). Its experimental use has \nturned into a recurrent practice, while being recognized as \nlifelong learning (Craciun and Bunoiu, 2019). Summer School \nCourses represent a new paradigm in non-formal education, \nbecause their capacity to promote teamwork, dynamics \ninteractions, a contextualization of the problems to be \naddressed, and its influence in further research development and \nlater-on career choices (Domingues et al., 2003 and Michaela, \net al., 2018).  \n \nPreventive preservation of Cultural Heritage (CH), unlike, \nremedial conservation and restoration, entail a lower economic \ncost and less aggressive intervention in terms of irrecoverable \ndegradation, loss-of-authenticity, and human errors. Within \nPreventive preservation, Heritage Education means to empower \nstudents with a knowledge and skill to safeguard CH assets, and \nto sensitize communities and individuals on the respect of \nheritage assets.  \n \nDocumentation of heritage assets is the first step in preserving a \nsite and its memory (Silver, 2019), accurate data representing \nthe shapes, colours, and relation of elements, are essential \ndocuments to communicate CH values, to plan and conduct \nconservation actions, and to store a fundamental piece of \nknowledge. On this line, Educating in Cultural Heritage \nDocumentations as a preventive preservation approach, requires \nthe consideration of challenges proposed by its three main \ncomponents, described below. \n \nFirst, ‘Cultural Heritage’ and its intrinsic formative value, need \nto be integrated/exploited within the educative action. The use \nof heritage solely as a case study is not enough. The multiple \ndimension of local heritage (beyond the tangible assets to be \ndocumented) are inextricably linked, and their interrelation is \nwhat confers the ‘true’/comprehensive cultural value. Our \nappointed challenge is to consider the multiple direct and \nindirect relationships among the cultural dimensions and \nintegrate them on in the study of heritage documentation. \n \nSecond, ‘(documentation) technologies’ and the specific \nknowledge associated with the appropriate use of techniques \nand equipment of survey and representation. Since technology \nis nowadays all around in our daily life, there is a powerful \ncomponent of internal motivation when conducting a \ntechnological initiative, especially within younger generations.   \nOur main challenge here is to exploit the motivational capacity \nthat technologies have, especially for out-of-school experiences, \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume IV-2/W6, 2019 \n27th CIPA International Symposium “Documenting the past for a better future”, 1–5 September 2019, Avila, Spain\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed. The double-blind peer-review was conducted on the basis of the full paper. \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-2-W6-61-2019  | © Authors 2019.

Integration of communities in \nCH initiatives reveal new forms of cultural information (McGill, \n2018). Our main challenge in this component is to introduce a \nmore complex narrative to the understanding of heritage, \nincluding the linkage between past and present concerns to local \nheritage resources.  \n \nIn 2018, University of Lisbon and Tampere University of \nTechnology, coordinated and conducted the International \nSummer School Unveiling the Hidden Hamina (first edition). \nIts main purposes were (i) to improve non-formal learning path \nby setting the dialog between communities, students, cultural \ncontext and science; and (ii) to strengthen the links between \nlocal community and its’ heritage resources. To the socio \n(educational) - human (cultural+communitarian) challenges, \nwere added the academic (technological) ones. The summer \nschools aimed to empower students with practical skills and \ncapacities to create a comprehensive documentation of CH \nassets using digital and analogic techniques. The course \nspecifically aimed to tackle the following current limitations:  \n \n• To re-define the role and contribution of freehand \nmeasuring/technical drawing in the documentation process  \n• To improve integration between laser scanning and \nphotogrammetry data in capture and processing phases  \n• To provide experiential learning on the use (analysis and \ninterpretation) of digital outputs  \n \n1.2. Seed project: HALILAMA 2017 \nIn 2016, the School of Architecture of Tampere University of \nTechnology was appointed to conduct the project Haminan \nlinnoituksen rakennusten laserkeilaus ja 3D-mallinnus \n(HALILAMA), aiming at the 3D digital documentation of the \nouter surface of 23 main buildings and courtyards in Old \nHamina city, Finland. Developed in 2017 in two stages of four \nmonths each, this project produced an accurate database of \ngeometric models (Fig. 1) and represented the initial community \nrelationship forming. It was identified a Social movement \nlooking for innovative solutions to protect and promote their \nculture, willingness to host initiatives coming from the \nacademic world.  \n \nFigure 1. Output from HALILAMA project: classified point \ncloud \n \nFigure 2. Students conducting a laser scanning training \n(academic course: Basic of Geospatial Technologies) \nThe large scope of the project together with a reduced period of \nwork with ‘optimal environmental conditions’, given the \nextended winter season in Finland, pushed us to integrate it \nwith an academic training course: Basic of Geospatial \nTechnologies (Fig. 2). The training course together with the \nstudent’s feedback created also a solid framework where to start \ndeveloping a summer school on Heritage Documentation in \nHamina.  \n \n1.3. Hamina, a unique historical location \nHamina, (Fredrikshamn in Swedish,) is a singular historical \nharbour town near the Russian border originally dedicated to \nKing Fredrik of Sweden. Hamina shares identity with its twin \ncity Vyborg, both in the Gulf of Finland (Baltic see). After large \nperiods of war and peace between Sweden and Russia, Vyborg \nended up on the Carelian isthmus under Russia governance, \nwhile Hamina on the Finnish side (Silver, 2018). Hamina city \nhas been the place of significant historical events such as the \nmeeting between King Gustaf III of Sweden and Empress \nCatherine II of Russia in 1783 (Nordenstreng, 1909); and has \nbeen involved in several military campaigns such as the Russo–\nSwedish War; the Finish War, and the Crimea War.  \n \nThe military imprint of Hamina is now visible through its \ncurrent shape, planned by Axel von Löwen and built in early \n18th century. Its ideal circular plan star-like fortress system and \nsingulars intersected encircling and center-radiating streets, \nechoes the Renaissance urban ideals, achieved only in another \nplace in Europe (Palma Nova, Italy). The city keeps alive its \nmilitary culture, specially thought the active Garrison and the \nmilitary academy for officers.  \n \n Within the Citadel, the selection of the specific spots in \nHamina answers a request from Hamina City, the Association of \nOld Houses and Courtyards of Hamina Fortress (Haminan \nlinnoituksen wanhat talot ry) and the National Board of \nAntiquities. These were to study sensitive sites with outdated \ndocumentation, and where upcoming development plans will \nrequire an accurate geometric documentation. The spot \nselection also considered specific requirements of the taught \ncontents: relevant areas from the cultural point of views, areas \nwith poor light conditions, and large and inaccessible areas \nfrom ground positions.  \n \nFirst, it was selected the Central Bastion of the historical \nfortress. The Bastion host among other events, the military \ntattoo Festival of the Finnish Defence Forces, one of the most \nnotable Military music Festival in Europe. Its outdoor Yard is \ncovered in Summertime with the biggest Canopy in Europa and \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume IV-2/W6, 2019 \n27th CIPA International Symposium “Documenting the past for a better future”, 1–5 September 2019, Avila, Spain\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed. The double-blind peer-review was conducted on the basis of the full paper. \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-2-W6-61-2019  | © Authors 2019.

The other \nstudy site were two selected cellars from Historical wooden \nHouses from the 19th century of the Czars’ period. Wooden \ntowns are fire-prone places, and Hamina has suffered recurrent \nfires, some of them devastating almost 80% of its extension. \nCellars are the remaining structure after fires, and therefore the \noldest evidence of the built housing environment.  \n \n1.4. Organization, course statistics and draft from \nacademic syllabus \nThe organization focused to integrate all relevant actors: local \ncommunities, local government, students, staff and partners in a \ntransversal programme. For providing both expert knowledge \nand technical updated equipment three Universities joined its \nefforts: University of Lisbon, Tampere University of \nTechnology, and Tampere University of Applied Sciences and \nNew University of Lisbon. \n \nProviding a bridge between local community and the course, \nwas the Association of Old Houses and Courtyards of Hamina \nFortress and City of Hamina. These together with Google \nResearch Data Centre in Hamina, were the main funders of the \nproject. To complement specific knowledges, consultancy and \ntechnical solutions, the course integrated relevant partners in the \nareas of Remote Sensing, Architecture and Cultural Heritage: \nAgisoft Photoscan, Symetri Addnode Group, Nordic Urbanism \nOy, and The International Council on Monuments and Sites \n(ICOMOS) and the Board of Antiquities, Finland. \n \nThe summer school was open to Master students, PhD students, \nand early-career PhDs. 15 participant students formed an \ninternational cohort from Portugal, Finland, Norway, Sweden, \nSlovenia, Brazil, Iran, and Pakistan. The course also hosted a \nwide range of student’s backgrounds included architects, \narchaeologist, CH managers, historians and Fine Arts. The staff \nwas composed for five professors and four invited speakers, \nshaping and experiential learning action of 56 hours combing \ntheoric-practical lectures, fieldwork and hands-on training. By \nthe completion of the course, three (3) ECTS Credits were \ngranted by Tampere University of Technology and University of \nLisbon.   \n \nThe course started with a two-days introductory session, \nconducted in Helsinki, Finland. The location specially took \nadvantage of world-wide known heritage sites related to \nmilitary heritage and Finnish culture. Moreover, its central \nlocation allowed us to bring relevant speakers to the sessions \nand minimize the transportation of incoming international \nstudents. Field trips and educative guided tours where \nintegrated with open roundtables providing a comprehensive \nvision of local culture and the understanding of students’ \nmotivation and interests. Next, five days of intensive learning \ntook place, conducting learning sessions in Hamina city, \nintegrating academic content (four main packages) with a sociocultural\nagenda, in order to implement the aimed \nmultidimensional vision. \n \n \nFigure 3. Hand-drawn illustration of Aalto Symposium, \nprovided by student Rui Carvalho \nThe seven-day course, conducted in the cities of Helsinki and \nHamina, was complemented with an optional two-day post \ncourse on the 14th International Alvar Aalto Symposium in \nJyväskylä, Finland (Fig. 3). This worldwide known triennial \nevent addressing social and technical challenge in architectural \ncontext was a unique opportunity for the students to interact \nwith professional and academic, and to expose and debate their \ngathered experiences. This 14th edition was especially relevant \nwithin the course’ context because it particularly promoted the \nintegration between construction processes and cultural \npreferences and variables.  \n \n2. ENGAGING COMMUNITY, A SINGULAR \nOPPORTUNITY \nBecause one primary role of academia is to ‘search for answers \nto our most pressing social, civic, economic, and moral \nproblems’ (Boyer, 1996), the conjunction of local stakeholders \nand academic actors become essential in our educational \napproach.  Since CH is not only the physical remaining, but a \nsource of individual and community identity (Garcia-Fernandez, \n2014), a comprehensive learning on CH requires the \ninvolvement of ‘its’ community. The study of Cultural Heritage \nis ‘a living experience’ and without a living community and \ncontext ‘it can be (and often is) killed stone dead’ (ASE, 2011). \nEngaging community in the learning process supports also our \nprinciple of experiential education, that is a hands-on, active, \nand in-context education. \n \nIn Hamina, we found a community extremely interested in \npreserving and valorising its culture, and openly willing to \nsupport research topic of local importance such as the \ndocumentation of their cultural resources. Thought the \nAssociation of Old Houses and Courtyards of Hamina Fortress, \nit was planned and executed a socio-cultural agenda in order to \nfoster student’s immersion on local culture and to provide \nsubstantial/integral experiences for both community members \nand participating students \n \n2.1. Student’s immersion through an integrated sociocultural\nagenda \nIncreasing student’s immersion on local culture was one of the \nmain goals of the international school. Looking to enhance \nstudent-community interaction, and to bring to the learning \nprocess the multidimension of the Cultural Heritage, the course \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume IV-2/W6, 2019 \n27th CIPA International Symposium “Documenting the past for a better future”, 1–5 September 2019, Avila, Spain\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed.

Beyond the necessities of cultural acceptance, \nissues such as religious and political discrepancies can arise \nspecially when students must share accommodation and space \nfor several days. During the first day, a brief student’ \npreparation was conducted, through the promotion of \ninteraction between them in a walking tour and a welcome \ndinner at the end of the day. Similar solution was conducted for \nthe student-community preparation at the first day in Hamina.  \n  \nAccommodation was included in the course. Members of the \nassociation volunteered to host students, and participants were \naccommodated in local houses, sharing the place with owners. \nPremises for dinner and lunch, or to conduct the course’s \nlectures, were also planned to bring the atmosphere of the \ncultural context to the course. For these were selected the redbrick\nbuilding of the officers’ club, designed by Carl Ludvig \nEngel (same architect of the Neo-Classical military academy in \nFinland and the Senate Square in Helsinki), and \nLinnoitusravintola Kamu! (Fortress Restaurant Kamu!) inside \nthe bastion (Fig. 4). \n \n \nFigure 4. Working lunch inside the bastion at \nLinnoitusravintola Kamu!  \nWithin the International summer school, it was also designed \nand implemented an integrated socio-cultural agenda. Each \nafternoon, at the end of the day, one cultural activity was \norganized. was specially promoted the complementation of \ncultural experience in natural heritage (Fig. 6), local traditions \n(Fig. 7), religion, food, and military-related culture.  \n \n \nFigure 5. Visit to protected natural heritage site, Eastern Gulf of \nFinland National Park \n \nFigure 6. Evening Sauna in the military recreational area of \nMäntlahti \n \n3. COURSE CONTENT \n3.1. Introduction to military construction in the context of \nFinland. \nFirst introductory part of the course looked to introduce the \ncourse goals and content and the local culture. \nThe relations between Hamina and Helsinki, specially in terms \nof military traditions and cultural resources, prompted us to start \nthis stage in the city of Helsinki.  Helsinki’s central l location \nallowed us also to bring relevant invited speakers on Finnish \nculture and CH documentation, such as Ms. Minna Silver, \npresident of ICOMOS Finland; and vernacular architecture and \nHeritage preservation such as Professors Fernando Vargas and \nCamila Mileto (University of Valencia).  \n \nIntroductory lectures were complemented with a Field trip day \nto the inhabited sea fortress island of Suomenlinna in Helsinki \n(Fig. 7). This site, inscribed on the United Nations Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World \nHeritage List, is one of the best preserved and musealized \nhistorical military premise. \n \nIt was of special interest the study-visit to the remnants of the  \n18th century fortress. Its star-like fortification structure \nfollowing the Vauban’s fortification system (Minna, 2018), has \nsimilarities in shape and period of construction to Hamina \nfortress. Educational trip included short talks of relevant scholar \nsuch as Prof. Marinos Ioannides from (Cyprus University of \nTechnology), and Prof. Gayle McKeen guiding tour on Finnish \nArchitectural Heritage in Helsinki.  \n \n \nFigure 7.

Results of \nprevious documentation tentative in the nearby city of Turku \nwere presented by archaeologist Kari Uotila which opened the \ndebate in the uses of documentation for preventive and physical \nprevention of heritage. This package ended with the physical \nvisit to the historical town and the heritage spots under study \n(city walk), conducted by members of the partner association. \nAt the end, it was accomplished a better understanding the role \nof the city in the Finnish context, and the student’s immersion \nwithin the cultural spirit of city, fundamental for conducting the \nnext hands-on trainings.   \n \n3.2. Freehand measuring drawings \nThere is open debate on the conflicts and current values of hand \ndrawing practice (Dulaney and Lyn, 2010). The affirmation of \nsimultaneous use of digital and analogic techniques is \nrepeatedly supported, however, when it comes to field and \ndocumental drawing in CH, much less attention received the \nneed for their optimal integration. \n \nOur thesis supports the need of extracting the capacities of \nvisual and physical interaction that field hand-drawing have. \nFor us, this is especially useful to optimize/increase efficiency \nin further remote sensing-based documentation, while creating a \nsingular bond between drawer and the site. Moreover, the \nprocess of thinking&drawing in-situ, specially carried on by \narchaeologists, architects, and conservationists, may have \nrepercussion on further physical preservation decisions. The \ncoordination between the physical presence in drawing and the \ntechnical background can shed significant conclusions on \nstructural assessment, materiality and other relevant issues to \nconsider in preservation processes.  \n \nThis first practical package of the course was conducted by \nProfessor Olli-Paavo Koponen. Students. Students coming from \nsocial and human areas receive their first introduction on the \nuse of basic human measures and sketching techniques. \nLooking to support and improve next phases, this package \nspecifically addressed issues on: \n• spatial analysis allowing for increasing \nexpediency/efficiency of remote-sensing survey (in terms of \naccessibility and lighting conditions) \n• physical presence/interaction, increasing the level of \nunderstanding of relevant features to be surveyed \n \n \nFigure 8. Understanding of basic human measures, provided by \nstudent Rui Carvalho \nAfter this package, students were able to create basic plans and \nsketched details with proper scale and orientation.  \n \n \nFigure 9. Representation of singular details and its basic \nmeasures, provided by student Rui Carvalho \n \n3.3. Laser Scanning and Aerial Photogrammetry \nDocumenting a place is a key starting point for the CH \npreservation. Laser Scanning and photogrammetry are two of \nthe main technologies used on current documentation strategies. \nAn increasement in accuracy and resolutions, has been recently \nbalanced with a decrement on equipment cost. The integration \nof this technologies with GPS survey, enhance data with the \ncapacities to be externally oriented. Having our models in \nglobal coordinates, allows the data independence from local \nreferences (streets, postal codes. etc.), especially temporary in \nour ever-evolving cities.  \n \nLearning packages of Laser Scanning and Aerial \nPhotogrammetry focused on empower students with expert \nknowledge for the identification of potentialities and limitations \nof each technology, and to apply them on real case scenarios.  \nThe course also addressed a main challenge, long-faced \nchallenge by both industry and academy (Hoon and Hong, \n2019), on the optimal integration of Laser Scanning and \nPhotogrammetric approaches. These two packages proceeded to \nbring the knowledge acquired in the hand-drawing field \ndocumentation, to plan and execute the field-work \ndocumentation training.  \n \nThe spots selection (Bastion and Cellars), as mentioned before, \nhelped to recognise the specific advantages and limitations of \nboth techniques. In Cellars, where the light conditions where \nextremely poor (no window and no electricity access for \nartificial illumination), Laser Scanning achieved accurate results \nwith a minimum cost on time and effort. In the bastion, where \nouter curtain wall and rampart were partially inaccessible from \nground positions, aerial photogrammetry affordably recorded \nthe targeted features, including real-colour information to the \nscene. \n \nLaser Scanning package was conducted by professors Kalle \nTammi and Ilkaa Tasanen, and included a half-day management \nsession.

Archaeology of Architecture, an applied used of remotesensing\nbased documents \nFollowing the course’s goal of exploring various documentation \napproaches and given its trans-method approach to the results, \nthe students had on their last day of course-work a module on \nbuilding archaeology. This module again integrated both the \ntheoretical presentation of contents (the context, goals, and \nmethods of the discipline) and the practical experimentation of \nthis approach to the built heritage. \n \nConducted by archaeologist and professor Leonor Medeiros \n(NOVA FCSH), the students were introduced to ideas of \narchaeology, stratigraphy, wear patterns or historical layers, \nwhich they then applied to the buildings under analysis. \nDivided into teams, the students had the opportunity to, in each \nof the selected sites, delve into and write the story of the \nbuilding through nothing more than the clues left by the \ntransformations those had suffered through time. \n \nAccording to best practice, the students used the precision \ndocuments (true-ortho images) produced in the previous days \n(Fig. 13), and contrasted each one with the evidence, taking \nconclusions about both the potential and the limitations of \nphotogrammetry and laser scanning to show the site’s history or \nto do archaeology of architecture. For example, the scale of \ndetail was discussed, as well as colour fidelity, and especially \nthe ease of measuring or making base-drawings with which to \nthen make the stratigraphic analysis on the field.  \n \n \nFigure 13.

Community feedback and result’s presentation \nSince the community was, along the course, a keystone to \npromote the full understanding of the cultural values, it was \ndesigned an evening session on social analysis and community \nengagement. The doors open event|: ‘Grab-a-free-pizza-slice \ncommunity meeting’ was conducted by Professors Panu \nLehtovuori and Dalia Milian-Bernal. It promoted an open \ndiscussion covering the topics of community agency and \nempowerment, and sustainable use of local cultural resources. It \nparticularly focused at bringing to the spot the role of \ncommunities in CH management, and the use of digital heritage \ndocument for the preventive preservation.  The session was an \nopportunity for resident to bring their thoughts on how to \npreserve and promote their heritage resources. Discussion also \ncovered cultural issues related with tourism, transportation and \nentertainment. \n \n \nFigure 14.

Presentation of results at the Hamina City Hall \n \n \n4. DISCUSSION \nTeaching technologies in the context of cultural heritage often  \nmarginalize the socio-human components. Communities are an \nirreplaceable actor when conducting heritage education action, \nand the opportunity to count on them should be exploited from \nthe very first moment of the action design.  \n \nThe International Summer School Unveiling the Hidden \nHamina, designed a non-formal learning path combining \ncommunity engagement, cultural heritage and technologies. The \ncourse empowered 15 Students with new knowledge and skills, \nwhile providing a unique experience for both community \nmembers and participating students. Through active \nengagement with the local community – as was achieved by \nworking to answer local needs or by living under the same roof \nfor several days – a closer connection between all those \ninvolved provided experiences that go beyond training in \ndocumentation, making it both a cultural and a scientific \nexchange.   \n \nThrough the summer school, relevant outputs in form of 2D \nplans and 3D models were created (Fig. 16). Local government \nand CH-related institutions in Hamina city were supplied with \nthese documents and post-course reports. Additionally, the \ncourse developed a multidisciplinary contact network within \nparticipants (students, staff and partners) and promoted the \ndevelopment of new areas of research. \n \n \nFigure 16. 3D cross-sections and 2D metric maps \n \nFeedback from course evaluations through an open-ended \nsurvey, indicates a high rating in the significance of community \nintegration within the course, and the relevance of the proposed \ncontents. It was also positively valued the field-work sessions \nand real-case analysis. The feedback also pointed out the \nintense tight schedule and how the students would have liked to \nhave a longer course, namely, to aid in better dominating what \nwas for many an entirely new content, which will require redesign\nof the course’s program for further editions.  \n \nBeyond the practical outputs and gained skills, the integration \nof local perspective (from residents) and academic and technical \nvision (from professors and students), decisively enriched the \ncollective memory of Hamina. The multiple interactions \nbetween students-community and the linkage with local \nheritage, promoted along the course, created affective bonds \n(Fig. 17) that are essential for the valorisation and protection of \nthe heritage of Hamina. \n \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume IV-2/W6, 2019 \n27th CIPA International Symposium “Documenting the past for a better future”, 1–5 September 2019, Avila, Spain\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed.
