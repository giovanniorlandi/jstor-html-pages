Klko,N(ov\nLESLIE DOUGLAS PARDONED.\nCattle Thief, Who Was a Privileged\nPrisoner, Given His Liberty.\nLeslie Douglas of Dayton, Lyon\nCounty, who was sent to State’s Prison\nfor ten years from Chnrchill County for\ncattle stealing, was pardoned by the\nState Board of Pardons at Carson last\nweek- The Carson News prints a “set\nof incidents of about three years ago’’\nwith the announcement of Douglas’ par\ndon. It was rnmored daring the last\ncampaign that au expose was to be made\nagainst the Warden aud Prison iorce\nthen in charge of the peuitentiary about\nletting a certain prisoner leave the\nprison to visit his family. Nothing\ncame of the rnmors, however, and it is\nsupposed that the followiug story from\nthe News contains the facts that were to\nhave been made public two years ago:\n“Douglas was soon made a trusty at\nthe State Prison aud part of his duties\nwere to care for the Warden’s horses.\nPresumably he was locked up every\nnight, as were other prisoners, but a\nguard chauciug to look into bis cell one\nnight was surprised to find it empty.\nHe reported the affair aud all bauds\nwere called on deck to make search of\nthe premises. The missing man could\nnot be fonnd and all sat down to wait\nuntil daylight to take the trail. Early\nin the morning, however, before day\nlight a noise was heard outside on the\nwalk and it resulted in the discovery\nthat it was Donglas on the Warden’s\nhorse. Mr. Douglas hod simply been\ndown to Dayton to visit his family and\nhad returned before daylight that his\nabsenoe might not be noted. It devel\noped that he had made several trips. He\nwrapped the horse\'s hoofs with sacks to\ndeaden the sound on the stoue flagging\naud but for un accidental investigation\nmight have gone on longer.\n“Had Donglas been so disposed be\ncertainly could have got far from the\nprison on any of the nights he took\nFrench leave aud his recapture would\nhave been uncertain.”\nSTATE NEWS.\nA rainstorm in Elko County lust week\ndid considerable damage to the hay\ncrop.\nIt is said that a good portiou of the\nhay crop in Lander Couuty will not be\nharvested on account of the scarcity of\nlabor.\nReno is about to try oil on its streets\nand a contract will be let to oil fivo\nblocks this season by way of experiment.\nIt will cost |300 a block.\nThe School Trustees of Harrima u\nhave passed an edict that no teacher\nshall be employed in the schools there\nunless they will agree to live at the new\nrailway center.\nAt a meeting of the Republican State\nCentral Committee held in Carson last\nweek it was decided that the Republi\ncan State Convention will be held in\nWiunemucca on Monday, August 8.\nSuperintendent McDouell issued or\nders to at once begin clearing away the\ndebris to make ready for the rebuilding\nof the Union Con. hoisting works that\nwere destroyed by fire at Virgiuia City\nlast week.\nJ. A. Isola of Carlin, Eiko Couuty,\nwas in Reno last week purchasing brick\naud other material for a new two-story\nhotel at Carlin. The building will con\ntain 40 rooms aud will have all modern\nimprovements.\nThp Giroux Mining Company, wlncn\nhas large holdings af Pilot Kuob in\nWhite Piue County, announces that it\nwill build a smelter at the Dewey and\nTaylor shafts and have it in operation\nbefore Winter sets in.\nThe Sacramento Bee has extended its\nCalifornia news service to include\nWestern Nevada. Possessed as it is of\na large circulation and edited iu a man\nner that canscs the people to read it,\nNevada will reap much benefit from the\nnew department of the Bee.\nAt a meeting of the Washoe County\nDemocratic Central Committee held at\nBeno last week, u resolution was passed\nrequesting (he appointment of a Demo\ncrat for Superintendent of the Hospital\nfor Meutal Diseases to suoceed Dr- Pat\nterson, resigned, and recommending\nDr. Gibson for the position.\nAfter two weeks’ steady work on the\npart of about 100 men, the fire that\nthreatened the destruction of about 40,\n000 tons of coal in the new bunkers at\nHpafkg was extinguished on July 16.\nControl of the flre was secured by cut\nting the immense pile in two and then\ntunneling through the smoldering\nmass.\nThe 10-year-old daughter of G. Ca\nvauta was burned to death in tho home\nof her parents in Pioche, Lincoln\nCounty, last week. The child was\nalone at the time, and, it is thought,\nwas playing with matches aud set the\nhouse ou fire. The building was nearly\ndestroyed when the firemen arrived. A\nsearch of the ruins disclosed the charred\nremains of the little girl. ._\nNEVADA POLITICAL TOPICS.\n’ Senator Mef Manas in tne .Journal.\nSenator Newlands returned to Reno\non Thursday of last week from St.\nLouis. In compliance with a request\nfor an interview on his experiences aud\nimpressions, Mr. Newlands dictated an\narticle for the Reno Journal of July 15,\nfrom which the following is taken:\n* * * “The Convention was at\nleast two-thirds composed of bi-metal\nlists, who were with us in ,r3 and 1900\nand who still believe in silver, but who\nfelt that the largely increased produc\ntion of gold had satisfied the money\nfamine and retired the issue for the\npresent. They were unv illiug to make\nany declaration in contradiction of their\nprinciples, but they were willing to re\nmain silent on the money question, hop\ning to unite the party on other and more\npressing issues. They felt that success\nin New York was essential, and they\nwere therefore willing to take New\nYork\'s candidate. * * *\n"Parker’s telegram to the Convention\nwas like a bombshell, aud was at first\nthought to be an attempt to dictate the\nplatform, but the Convention would\nhave adjourned sine die before it would\nhave committed itself to the gold stand\nard. It had declared itself most em\nphatically against Hill’s mild gold stand\nard plank and was in no humor to re\nverse itself. * * *\n"I am inclined to think that if Mr.\nBryan hod shared in the conlerences of\nthe Committee on Resolutions on this\ntelegram he would have come to the\nsame conclusion. (That the money plank\nwas purposely left out, aud that Parker\nwas at liberty to hold his own views re\ngarding it.) But after the committee had\ndetermined upon the reply, aud wnilst\nit was being considered in the Couven\ntion, Mr. Bryan appeared aud for the\nfirst time was drifted into the consider\nation of the matter. It was very natural\nfor him in the indignation of the mo\nment to receive the impression that it\nwas a trick, or an attempt to bulldose,\nand he used some expressions that indi\ncated that he regarded it as an attempt\nto write a gold standard plank in the\nplatform, but this impression whilst not\nunnatural, was unwarranted. We all\nknew that the platform was so trained\nas to permit both gold and silver men\nto support, or to run on, the Democratic\nticket regardless of their views on the\nmoney question, aud the Convention\nsaid this aud nothing more in reply to\nJudge Parker’s telegram.”\nA Hard Case.\nIt is au extremely difficult case which\nthe Democratic party of Nevada has\nundertaken to present to the people of\nthis State during the coming campaign.\nIt has had nothing to offer for some\nyears back, but it kept up the cry for\nsilver, and tiiis magnetic slogan was\npowerful enough to hold many waver\ning votes to the support of its shaky\nplatforms. It has asserted vehemently\nits devotion to this principle, but. alas,\nnow it is left high aud dry. The Na\ntional Convention has no use for silver,\nand the nominee for President made it\nplainly understood that he is a gold\nman and he would not accept the nomi\nnation unless his viewB on tne monetary\nquestion were shared by a majority of\nthe delegates. That those views were\nthe views of the Democratic party was\nsoon manifest. Deprived of its only\nclaim for consideration aud with the\nombarassment of former declarations\nupon its head, the Democratic party of\nNevada will sorely need the aid of di\nviue revelation in preparing its finan\ncial plauk at its coming State Conven\ntion.—Carson News.\nSilver 1‘arty Should Deuutud Same*.\nIn the press report lrom St. Louis we\nfind that when the vote was taken\nSaturday night to send the dispatch to\nParker committing the Democratic\nparty to the gold standard that the six\nvotes from Nevada divided—two beiug\nfor sending it and four against. Wonder\nwho wcs who?—Reno Gazette.\nInvitation to Voters.\nVoters are invited by the Republican\nparty to study its record; the Demo\ncrats earnestly hope that theirs may be\nforgotten.—Carson News.\n« r\'rm-fnr-au rum.\nWhen Governor Sparks wrote bis\nletter declining to ran for the office of\nSenator he wrote it in good faith. Since\nthat time there hag been a plan proposed\nby which all candidates will be placed\nupon one ticket and the man receiving\nthe highest vote of his party will be\nconsidered the choice of his party, aud\nthe Legislature will be compelled to fol\nlow the wishes of the people thus ex\npressed. The Governor has never signi\nfied his intention of running under this\nplan, but his friends insist that they\n’Will place him upon the ticket, as they\nregard him as the strongest man in his\nparty in the State to-day. Should this\ncourse be taken and he is endorsed at the\npolls, it is not likely that he can with\nstand the pressure of his party under the\ncircumstances. It was the idea of pur\nchasing a seat in the United States Sen\nate that disgusted the Governor, and he\nsaid he would have none of it.—Carson\nAppeal.\nDon\'t Grt Ejrritnl.\nIt is hardly worth while for our peo\nple to get excited over Judge Parker’s\nstatement that he regards the gold stand\nard as au established fact. Everybody\nwho has a nickel’s worth of brains in\nhis head knows that it is an established\nfact, aud must remaiu so until monetary\nconditions change. Judge Parker’s\nstatement does not vary the issues of the\ncampaign one iota. The Democratic\nplatform is silent on the money question,\nwhich leaves the issue open for future\nconsideration. The telegram to Parker\nstates, in effect, that as the question of\nthe standard is not a possible issue in\nthe cuuipaigu, it can make no difference,\nso far as his candidacy is concerned,\nwhat he thinks about it. His statement\nis simply the expression of his personal\nopinion on au abstract question, and\nbinds his party to nothing which is not\ncontained iu the platform.—R no Jour\nnal.\nMayor TurrlUin for Cony reus.\nDuring the past month several names\nhave been mentioned for the Congres\nsional nomination on the Republican\nside of the house, but so far we think\nnone of them could win. There is one\nman, however, whose name has not\nbeen mentioned who can curry the\nState against any candidate the Fus\nionists put up, and that is Mayor Tur\nrittin ot Reno. We do not know as he\nwould accept the nomination if tendered\nhim, but we do know that he is a strong\nman and would be elected. He has\nmade a splendid Mayor of the leading\ncity of Nevada, and would make a rep*\nresentative whom all could feel proud\nof. If the Republican party wants a\nwinner this year it should nominate\nMayor Turrittiu for Congressman.—\nElko Free Press.\nWould If They Could.\nThe Republicans who are laboring un\nder the delusion that the nomination of\nParker means that Roosevelt will carry\nthis State, must be men who are led\nmore by their hopes than by their politi\ncal acumen. Iti the first place they\nshould get it out of their heads that\nParker is running on a gold platform,\nand they nest should disabuse their\nminds of the idea that he ever iusisted\non a gold platform.—Carson Appeal.\nCandidates for Supreme Judge.\nThe fight for the Fusion nomination\nfor Supreme Judge at the present lies\nbetween Judge B. F. Curler of Reno,\nH. F. Bart me of Carson and the present\nincumbent, C. H. Belknap. J. D.\nTorreysoii of Carson is the only Repub\nlican that has thus far been mentioned\nfor the position.\nBimetallists Has* Been Worsted.\nThe conclusion that he (Parker)\nreached, that the country is on a gold\nbasis is true. The bimetallists have been\nworsted in their tight for free coiuage\nand enacted laws which place us on a\ngold basis.—Carson Appeal.\nLooking for Its Corner Stakes.\nThat partner of the Democracy in Ne\nvada, the Silver party, will doubtless\nnow spend a few days trying to nscer*\ntain where it is located.—Salt Lake Tri*\nbune.\n\'•\nAustin Teachers Elected.\nFrom the minutes of the meeting of\nthe Austin School Trustees published in\nthe Reveille of July 16, it is learned\nthat the following teachers have been\nselected for the coming term: Principal,\nP. C. Cullen; First Grammar Depart\nment, Miss Maggie Kearn; Second\nGrammar Department, Miss Jessie\nSchmidtleiu; Primary, Miss Mildred\nCaton. It was ordered that the follow\ning salaries be paid per mouth: Princi\npal #110, First Grammar #80, Second\nGrammar #70, Primary #60.\nLeslie Smaill last week secured the in\nterest of his partner, Bert Hansen, in the\nChurchill Standard, published at Fallon,\nChurchill County.\nASSAYING\nW.

Smith, Agent. *\nCHERRY CREEKERS AROUSED.\nInsinuate That Thomas and Arm\nstrong Were Aided to Escape.\nA number of prominent citizens of\nCherry Creek, White Pme Connty,\nhave signed "A Remonstrance," which\nwas printed in the White Pine News of\nJuly 14, which deals with the case of\nArmstrong and Thomas, who escaped\nfrom the county jail at Ely the night of\nJuly 4. After reciting the various\ncrimes which the two prisoners com\nmitted inland around Cherry Creek aud\ntheir arrest in Elko County for horse\nstealing, tho communication tells of the\ndecision of the people of Cherry Creek\nto bring the two men back to White\nPine County, involving considerable ex\npense, to try them there for the rob\nberies committed. "Now, forsooth,"\nthey say, "we learn, after all the ex\npense, labor and inconvenience, those\nsame men are turned loose on the com\nmunity, without a trial, to again com\nmit their depredations and terrorize the\npeople. We are not so far away from\nthe county seat but we can learn pretty\ncorrectly what has happened there.\nWho believes the ‘knights of the road’\ncould escape from the iron cages un\naided, or without tools secreted\nby themselves or passed to them ?\nWho that knows our Sheriff Newman\nor Tom Weldon would believe they\nlacked courage to follow the escapes ?\nThey are tried men, aud would have\nfollowed them t« the last ditch had not\nsome other influeuoe been brought to\nbear on them."\nAfter telling of the places the two es\ncapes visited after leaving the Ely jail,\nthe article 6tates, "aud furthermore,\none of the posse which was presumably\nin search of the robbers, told that they\ndid not desire to catch them."\nThe remonstrance concludes: "It is\nto be hoped Judge Browu will, at the\nnext term of Court, select a Grand Jury\nthat will fully examine into the merits\nor demerits of this pretended escape aud\nlet the disgrace rest on the right sho ai\nders. ”\nDO UP THE BABY IN A BAG.\nI Up-to-Date Babies Will Soon Be Clad\nin Infantile Djibbahs.\nThe newest method of baby dressing,\nin regard to which even the single pin\nand turning are declared nnneoessary,\nis being adopted by the Chioago en\nthusiasts on the subject of dress reform\nfor babies.\nThe new little garments—as yet made\nonly in Loudon—open down the shoul\nders and sleeves and are fastened with\nsmall, unobtrusive buttons. To drese\nthe baby the garments are arranged in\nplace, oue over the other, the front por\ntions turned down, and the baby laid\nin—or on—them. Then the front por\ntions are turned to place, and his small\nkingship quickly buttoned into fnll and\ncomplete garbing. The child is fresh,\nunwearied, an irritated by mnch hand\nling and tnrning, the little limbs are\nfree to stretch, kick, twist, torn, and\ngrow as they will.\nSome of these garments were reoently\nmade for the wardrobe of a 3-months\nold Chicago baby. The little frocks, one\nof fine wool, the other of fine moslin,\nand the flannel petticoat, belong to the\n“Alione” system devised by a knowing\nbaby lover of London, and the diminn\ntive “djibbah” was designed and exe\ncuted after a London model also. It is\nthe work of the artist designer, who is\nknown only as “Sheba,” and who was\nresponsible for the introduction of the\ndjibbah, originally an Egyptian gar\nment, to Western women. Like many\nother brilliant creations, the fall-grown\ndjibbah sprang into being as the result\nof pure accident. Traveling in Egypt,\n“Sheba” was cbarmed with the simple\nliues and folds of the dervish garment.\nReturning to England, she worked oat\na similar garment for her little daughter\n—this was the original djibbah. The\neffect was so oharming to lovers of\nariistic feminine apparel that the\nfeminine djibbah became popular with\nout delay.\nBANK OF NEVADA\nVirginia Street, Reno, JVevada.:\nTRUSTEES:—Daniel Meyer, Herbert Fleishhacker of San\nFrancisco; Moritz Scheeline, Geo.

A. 8KILLMAN.\nSATURDAY, JULY 28. 1904.\nIRRIGATION IN NEVADA.\nThe San Francisco Chronicle of July\n18 contains the following timely edi\ntorial:\nContracts which appear to provide\nfor the completion of the work on at\nleast a portion of the Truckee-Carson\nirrigation project in Nevada are now\nbeing let, and by the end of March of\nnext year it is expected that water will\nbe flowing through all the ditches in\nChurchill County. We do not under\nstand that this will complete the project\nso as to open up all the lands which will\nultimately be watered from this main\ncanal. The latter part of the present\nyear, however, will doubtless see the\nbeginning of activity in settlement.\nSome of the land under this ditch, we\nbelieve, is railroad land, which will not\nbe settled until all the Government\nland, which can be obtained for nothing\nexcept the cost of the works, is occu\npied. The railroad companies will\ndoubtless then put upon the alternate\nsections whatever price the traffic will\nbear, and permit purchasers to make\ntheir own bargains with the Govern\nment. The lands, however, cannot be\nsold in large tracts, for no one can get\nwater from a Government ditch for\nmore than 160 acres of land.\nIt is doubtful whether the lands\nunder these Government canals will\never become a “poor man’s country.”\nThe Government work is done in the\nmost substantial manner, with a view\nof reducing the cost of maintenance to\na minimum. xuis munea i/uo\noutlay large, and it must all be spread\nupon the laud. While time is given,\nwithout interest, yet the installments\nmust be paid in the end, and the cost of\npreparing the laud for the water and\nthe erection of even the simplest of\nfarm buildings will presumably exceed\nthe cost of the ditches. A person,\ntherefore, who expects to settle on these\nlands must have money enough to do\nthis preliminary work, or he will not be\nable to meet his Government payments,\nwithout which he can get no title to his\nland. Apparently, a person should be\nin possession of at least $20 for each\nacre of land whioh he expects to take\nup. This, with his own work, ought to\nplace him in a condition to support a\nfamily and meet his expenses for water.\nThe time seems now to have arrived\nwhen those who think of settling on\nthese lauds and who have the money to\nmake a start, should be visiting the dis\ntrict and deciding upon a location. If\nwater can be got for domestic nses, set\ntlers can presumably live on their laud\nuntil the water reaches them, support\ning themselves by work for the contrac\ntors. _\nNEVADA’S POLITICAL\nREGENERATION.\nWe extend to the good people of Ne\nvada, the assurances of oar most dis\ntinguished consideration, says the Utah\nState Journal. It appears that Nevada\nis proceeding to mount the shining\nheights. She is going to have a square\nSenatorial fight. Our neighbor State is\nproud of her mines and proud of her ir\nrigation movement. But she has more\noccasion to glorify herself in this reu\nnaUsa ice of political houesty then in all\nother things combined.\nWhat a splendid thing it will be for\nNevada to have elected by honesty and\nincorruptible Legislatures, men who, in\ntheir tarn, will serve honestly and in\ncorruptibly in the National halls ! Not\nthat all men elected in Nevada have\nbeen tainted, bat because some of them\nhave been, and because the Battle-Born\nState has suffered immeasurably there\nby in the judgment of mankind.\nHonesty in public life is so much bet\nter for Nevada tbe The Sack. When\nonce the old and honest way shall be re\nstored, when venality shall have been\nbanished, what a proud rank Nevada\ncan take among the States of the Union,\nAud how gloriously will her upright\ncitizenship hold itself in the eyes of the\nworld J No longer will her Legislatures\nawait the coming of the messenger from\nthe banks of San Fiaucisco, in order tc\nto find out their own opinions concern\ning public questions. No longer need\nthey feel that the profitable industry foi\nthe State is milking of the cow whose\nhind quarters are at Fourth and Town\nsend streets in San Francisco.\nThey are able to do things for them\nselves—the strong people of Nevada.\nThey are able to pass laws, good laws,\nnnpnrchased laws, for the government\nof the State; to elect Nevada citizens to\nthe House of Representatives and the\nSenate of the United States.\nAnd the State will take the glory to\nwhich it is entitled. Its soil yields\nnnder the splendid touch of industry;\nits mines are richer than ever before in\nits history; its manhood and its woman\nhood are as brave and as pore as in the\nolden time. Nevada, with corruption\ndriven out of its politics, is to really be\nwhat its founders hoped, one of the\nmost glowing stars in the eternal con\nstellation of the Union sky.\nG. A. Leavitt has been elected Princi\npal of the school at Gold Hill, Storey\nCounty, vice Prof. A. E.

He is quoted\nin a dispatch from Elkins to the Wash\nington Star as saying:\n“Judge Parker and I are in accord on\nthe gold standard issue. I was a mem\nber of the sab-committee on platform at\nthe St. Louis Convention and voted for\nthe sound-money plank which recog\nnized the gold standard as fixed.\nEDIT OAEBAWAY DAVIE.\n"The subsequent events in the full\nCommittee on Resolutions and in the\nConvention itself are matters of history.\nJudge Parker’s dispatch, which was read\nin the Convention, caused some com\nmotion at the time, but matters were\nquickly adjusted, and, I believe, adjusted\nto the satisfaction of all of the delegates.\n"On the tariff question I have always\nbeen a conservative, and that is all I\ncare to say now on the issues of the cam\npaign.

L. Fitzgerald in explanation of the\nerroneous construction that has been\nplaced upon certain statements in his\ninterview printed in the Elko paper at\nthe time the Judge announced his can\ndidacy for United States Senator from\nNevada. The Judge again explicitly\nsets forth his position on the silver\nquestion, and refers to other important\nwork that he will undertake in the\nevent of his election. He in part says:\n“That in case of my election to the\nUnited States Senate, I will devote all\nof my time to the restoration of silver,\nto the exclusion of all private business,\ninterests and concerns, but not (as has\nbeen said) to the exclusion of auy busi\nness or duty that might come to me in\nthe capacity of Senator.\n"Believing at the time of my inter*\nview with you that so many mistakes\nhave been made in the discussion of the\nmoney question, I regarded it as no\nsmall undertaking to correct them. I\nthen thought, and now think th it a suit\nshould be brought to test finally in the\nUuited States Court the question of the\ndemonetization, and also the constitu\ntionality of the ‘greenback’ mouetizi\ntion. The silver demonetization has\nnever come before the said court, and I\nhere assert that the constitutionality of\nthe ‘greenback’ monetization has never\nbeen adequately, properly or fairly pre\nsented to said court. Again, the ques\ntions should be fully and adequately\nand truly presented to the people. This\nI assert has not been done.\n“There is one thing that I especially\nwould like to take part in accomplish\ning, and that is in amendiug the Uuited\nStates Constitution so that Uuited\nStates Senators should be elected by a\ndirect vote of the people.\n“Therefore, should I be so fortunate\nas to be chosen for the office of Senator,\nI shall earnestly, faithfully aud labori\nously endeavor to discharge every duty\nappertaining thereto to the best of my\nability. No duty, great or small, will\nbe overlooked or slurred or slighted; but\neach receive the best efforts for its\nproper discharge that I can command*”\nDIAZ HAS RECREATED MEXICO.\nSacramento Bee: Porfirio Diaz has\nagain been re-elected President of\nMexico, a position he has held for these\nmany years.

Look at the matter from\nany standpoint and the conviction is\nforced upon everybody that the observ\nance of the National holiday in Carson\ns&nk into ft deplorablo rot of partisan\nship and rat holes for private graft. It\nwas recognized on all sides as a Repub.\nlican Carnival. The men who sub\nscribed the most money were kicked into\nthe background. It was in no sense a\npopular celebration in which all towns\npeople could sink their differences and\njoin hands for a good time.\n"The bills itemized in the Appeal are\nnot all as they were put in, but as cut\ndown by the Committee. Some of the\nbills as they originally stood would make\nthe bandit who kidnaped Peracadis fall\noff his horse, if he had been asked to\nendorse them. They were simply plain\nhigh-binding graft and nothing else.\nThe newspapers of the city gave the\nfree nse of their columns for fcdvertis\ning purposes. They gave alike, but\nwhen the patronage was distributed the\nNews was given over four times the\namount, received by the Appeal. How\never, as it has been stated, it was a Re\npublican Carnival and the Appeal has no\nkick coming.\n"A public Carnival should be an abso\nlutely non-partian proposition and never\nbe allowed to fall into the hands of a\nfew managers, and no one connected\nwith the management should be allowed\nto a realize a single dollar ont of their\nposition, and there shonld be no special\nprivileges to the few that are not al\nlowed to all.”\nWilliam McClure Gotwaldt on\nWednesday purchased tlie Harriman\nHerald from Major Patton, and tendered\nhis resignation as city editor of the\nReno Gazette.

Oddie Hurriedly Leaves for San\nFrancisco to Sue for Divorce.\nThe Reno correspondent to the San\nFrancisco Call sent that paper the fol\nlowing sensational story on July 19:\n“Society of Reno was startled to-day\nby a story from Tonopah to the effect\nthat Tasker L. Oddie, general manager\nof the Tonopah Mining Company and\none of the wealthiest men in the new\nmining district, had engaged attorneys\nwith a view of filing a suit for divorce\nagainst his wife, from whom he sepa\nrated several days ago.\n“According to the report here Oddie\nis in San Francisco conferring with his\nlawyers and is expected to institute pro\nceedings there or in this town in a few\ndays. The ground upon which his suit\nwill be based is said to be incompatibil\nity of temper, although gossip has it\nthat the couple have separated for more\nserious reasons.\n“The first intimation that Oddie and\nhis wife bad quarreled was received\nhere yesterday, when it became known\nthat Mr. Oddie had left Tonopah hur\nriedly for San Francisco. He had\nbarely passed through Reno on his way\nto the bay before it was learned that\nMrs. Oddie was in hot pnrsnit of her\nhusband. Unfortunately for her plans,\nhowever, the train bearing her from\nTonopah was derailed out on the desert,\nwhere she and other passengers were\ndelayed for nearly 30 hours. The wife\nfinally reached Reno, where she was\nmet by friends of her husband, who, it\nis said, persuaded her to abandon her\ntrip to San Francisco, and she reluct\nantly returned to Tonopah.”\nMrs. Oddie was formerly Miss Claire\nMcDonald of San Francisco, and she\nis about 22 years of age. She was mar\nried to Mr. Oddie in the Episcopal\nOharch at Carson City on December 2,\n1903. Mrs. Oddie has been confounded\nwith her mother, formerly Mrs. Clara\nBell McDonald of Pacific-Bank and\nSeneca-Swalm fame.\nOddie Scorns Reconciliation.\nThursday’s Call says that “Mrs.\nHelen M.

Shortly\nafter their arrival here yesterday Mrs.\nScoville and Gardner were in conference\nwith Mr. Oddie for some time.

He had $100 on\ndeposit in a bank at Steelville, Mo.,\nand Lawrenoe drew it out for him. As\nsoon as the money arrived, Garrison\npaid Lawrenoe $86 due him for servioes\nrendered in assisting him to locate a\nhomestead.

The plank\nwhich was voted down favored ‘a wise,\nconservative and business-like’ revision,\nmade \'with due regard to existing con\ndit one.’ The oommittee thought that\nthese qualifying weeds emasculated the\npi-nit and left it so weak as to give no\nhope to the tariff reformers.\n"The anti-Trust plank is a good one.\nIt demands the enforcement of the\ncriminal clause of the criminal law\n■gainst the Trusts; it demands the\nabolition of rebates and discriminations\nand it demands the withdrawal of the\ninterstate privileges from Trusts when\nonoe convicted. The plank is infinitely\nsuperior to the Republican plank, and\nwith a President who desired to destroy\nIke Trusts would be a sufficient plank;\nbut as this Trust plank also was substi\ntuted by the full oommittee there is\nreason to fear that it may not be in\nkeeping with the ideas of the candidate.\n"The labor plank is nearly all that\ncould be desired. It declares against Gov\nernment by injunction; it favors arbitra\ntion and the eight-hour day, and de\nnounces methods that have been re\nsorted to in the Colorado strike; but as\nthese planks were added in the full\noommittee some uncertainty exists as to\nthe candidate’s position.\n“The platform declares in rnvor ui\nthe redaction of the army. Upon this\nthe committee was unanimous. The\nsab-committee reported a plank in favor\nof an increase of the navy, but this was\nstricken out in the full committee.\n"The platform has a plank in favor of\nthe enlargement of the scope of the In\nterstate Commerce Commission, and in\nfavor of irrigation. The general clauses\nof the platform excite no dispute, and\ntbs appeal against the introduction of a\nraoe issue ought to have weight with\nthe sober-thinking Americans.\n"On the whole the platform is good.\nProm a Western standpoint its greatest\ndefect is that it makes no mention of\nyhy money question. An attempt was\nTnoiU to secure a plank opposing the\nmelting of the silver dollars, opposing\nthe asset currency and branch banks,\nand expressing » preference for the\nUnited States note (ordinarily known\ntm the greenback) over the bank note)\nbut, having refused to put in a gold\nplank, the committee was not willing\nto have isy phase of the money ques\ntion alluded to.\n"While the motion to reaffirm the\nFtf-*"** city platform was voted down,\n(there was a considerable vote in favor\nof its reaffirmation, and the Western\nmembers of the committee, together\nwith a few from the South, stood to\ngether and secured cooagh changes in\nthe platform to make it a presentable\ndocument and worthy of the support of\nthe party.”\nDenounces Davis, Parker and Bryan\nEugene Debs, the Socialist candidate\nfor President, said at Terre Haate, Ind.,\nlast week: "Organized labor has no\nmore uncompromising enemy than\nHenry G. Davis, Democratic nominee\nlor Vice President, who charges Union\nlabor with being a criminal conspiracy,\nand doesn’t permit his employes to be\nlong to Trades Unions. When tbe\nUnited Mine Workers were conducting\na strike in West Virginia, I went there\nat the request of and with United Mine\nWorkers officials. We were enjoined\nby United States Jndge Jackson from\neven leaving oar boarding bouses.\nHenry G. Davis was mainly instru\nmental in haying this done. He is the\nvery incarnation of the old-time slave\ndriver. As to Parker, he is merely the\npersonal candidate of John D. Rocke\nfeller. Six weeks ago William J. Bryan\nsaid that no self-respecting Democrat\ncould support Judge Parker, the tool of\nthe Trusts and of tbe money powt y.\nMr. Bryan is now supporting him, and\nin so doing is proclaiming himself a\npolitical degenerate. ”\nMill for Goldfield.\nAlex.

On account of a rate war be\ntween different Atlantic lines rates as\nlow as $10 per passenger for the Jour\nney from Europe to America have been\ngiven. Fear has been expressed in some\nquarters that the ten dollar immigrant\nwould prove a very poor sort of Amer\nican citizen, but the immigration au\nthorities at New York say that no mat\nter what the rates the laws passed to\nkeep undesirable Immigrants out are\nbeing rigidly enforced, and If the steam\nship companies bring over any such\npassengers they are forced to take\nthem back.\nJ.

P\'fou) Jap. 1 to June 12 of the\npresent year 346,323 immigrants af\nrived in this country, the great ma\njority through the port of New York.\nThe total number of Immigrants for\nthe year 1903 was 882,938, a number\nwhich established a new record, the\nfpay }882 having held the record for\nvolume of immigration up to that time.\nThis number of Immigrants would\nform a city of greater population than\nany In America except New York, Phil\nadelphia and Chicago. The gross uu\nnual revenue from this traffic to the\nvarious Atlantic steamship companies\nIs ustpnatod at about $20,000,000. Dur\ning the old days a jonrppy across the\nAtlantic as a steerage passenger in\nvolved much discomfort and positive\nhardship. There was scarcely any\nfresh air In the steerage quarters and\nvery little light found its way down\ninto this part of the ship. The steam\nship compauina Jammed as many Im\nmigrants Into their vessels as they\nwould carry and brought them over\nwith the least possible expenditure.\nThe air which the steerage pussengers\nbreathed was foul, their fare was poor\nand they slept in open bunks, dressing\nin f«|J yjpvy of one another, the condi\ntions permitting of gp privacy what\never. A veteran captain says:\n“Compare this state of affairs with\nthe provisions made for this same\nclass of travel on the new Arabic,\nwhich made her maiden voyage a few\nwfcakj pgo, and which represents about\nthe latest in statFage equipment. The\nold open bunks have disappeared en\ntirely and all the third class people\nsleep in staterooms holding only two,\nfour or six persons. These quarters are\nJust as roomy as those of the first and\nsefond cabins, though of course they\nare not aw glpely fitted up. But there\nIs plenty of space, m. jypJJ as wide\nberths, a looking glass and a broad sea$\nIn each room.\n“In the third class saloon the trav\nelers sit In swivel chairs at tables\nspread with white linen, and the food\n.’hat Is served is as substantial as that\nwhich goes to the high priced passen\ngers, although the menu Is not so\nvaried, but It Includes plenty of fresh\nmeat, vegetables and soup with ocat;\nsionnlly fruit or even ice cream foj\ndessert.
