E. MacPber\nson, Lester and Charles Crocker and\nA. L. Daniel returned Monday from\na ten-day fishing tnp to the Bung\nalow. The trip was a decided suc\ncess, judged by either the number\nand size of fish caught, or by the\ngood time enjoyed by ail.\nThe Bungalow is rapidly and just\nly becoming one of the favorite\npleasure resorts of Idaho it not of\na much larger territory. It is\nlocated on the North Fork of the\nClearwater river in the great Clear\nwater National Forest. For several\nyears it has served as a ranger sta\ntion, and is now about to become\nthe headquarters for the district in\nwhich it is located. Three years\nago this summer a great forest tire\ndestroyed the timber on either side\not the North Fork for miles around\nthe Bungalow and also destroyed the\nbuilding, a beautiful bungalow,\nfrom which the place gets its name.\nThe popularity of the Bungalow\nis easily determined by the roads,\nwhich were in fine shape and much\ntraveled. Also, we found that over\nthree hundred visitors had register\ned at The Oxford, another ranger\nstation 12 miles this side of the\nBungalow. It was observed that\nthese came from widely scattered\nplaces but principally from the\nNorthwest and Canada.\nThe country surrounding the\nBungalow is one ot the most scenic\nplaces in the Northwest, as testified\nby all who visit it. The mountains\nare for the most part great jagged\ngranite peaks, which show their\ncolors thru the breaks in the timber\nor thru the «nags and under-growth\nof the burnt-over country.\nThe country also abounds in game.\nNot only are some ot the finest hsh\nbrought out ot the Bungalow\ncountry, but also dter r eik, bear,\nand smaller game are plentiful.\nThe game will in all probability be\npreserved for many years to come\nas the early snows and late thaws\nprevent their wanton destruction by\nprofessional or would-be profession\nhunters. The roads are impassable\nfrom the early or middle of Novem\nber to the first ot June at the earli\nest. During much of this time the\nroads cannot be traveled with a car.\nThe nearness of the Bungalow, it\nis only a good half-days drive from\nKendrick, and the charater of the\ncountry destine it to become, within\nthe next few years, one of the fav\norite resorts of a large number of\npeople not only ot Kendrick and\nvicinity but of the Northwest.\nA number ot young ladies from\nKendrick and surrounding country\nreturned last week from summer\nschool at Lewiston.\nPren Moore to Give Demon\nstration Here.\nit\nof\nPrep Moore, poultry expert of the\nextension department ot the state,\nwill be at the Jcbn F. Reid farm,\n1 mile northwest of Kendrick, Mon\nday afternoon at 2 o\'clock, and will\ngive a poultry culling demonstra\ntion for the benefit ot tbe general\npublic. The work is being carried\non in connection with the Latah\nCounty Farm Bureau and . County\nAgent Fletcher will be present to\nassist in tbe demonstration.\nTo those who have never witness\ned Pren Moore in this line of work\nthere awaits a liberal education in\nthe breeding, feeding and care of\npoultry. The information which\nhe gives is along practical lines and\nis intensely interesting and highly\ninstructive. His culling demon\nstrations have created widespread\ninterest throughout the state be\ncause he proves beyond question\nof doubt that he can "deliver the\ngoods".\nA model poultry house, recom\nmended by the extension depart\nment, will be on exhibition at the\ndemonstration. Plans may be se\ncured for its construction. Don\'t\nmiss this opportumtv to hear Mr.\nMoore—it will be a wise investment\nof time.\nThere will also be a demonstra\ntion for the Juliaetta people at the\nJ. C. Hamil place, Monday morn\ning, at 9 o\'clock.\nRoad Now Open\nIt is announced that the road that\nhas been under Oonstruattlon from\nLewiston to Spalding, on the north\nside of the Clearwater, is again open\nto traffic, and that detours are no\nlonger necessary, according to the\nLewiston Tribune.\nThe road is a link in the North\nand South highway and will con\nnect with the Spalding bridge acroes\nthe Clearwater, the plans for which\nare now in Washington for approval\nby federal highway officials. It is\nthought that the plans ■will be\nturned in a few days, at which time\nbids will be advertised for.\n—Genesee News.\nWill Inspect Potatoes\nC. W. Hungerford, plant disease\nspecialist of the University of\nIdaho, will be in this section of\nLatah county, Monady, in company\nwith County Agent Fletcher to in\nspect potatoes for certification a:\nseed.

It is\nbuilt standard width, on standand\ngrade and surtaced with crushed\nrock. It is said that the labor re\nquired to build the road was donat\ned by the people of the Southwick\ncommunity and the crushed rock\nfurnished bv the countv. The gen\neral belief seems to have prevailed\nin the Potaltch that good roads cost\n, . . .\nso much that they couldn t be built\nin this neck ot the woods, but\n4be\nwork done by the Southwick people\nought to convince the most skepti-\ncal. 1 he right spirit and co-opera\ntion will turn the trick every time,\nThe Southwick people expect to\nbuild several miles more of surtac\ned highway in the near future.\n--\nWhatever else may happen now\nthat the country\'s dry; the sailor\nstill will have his port, the farmer\nhave his rye.

The nation\'s wheat crop is es\ntimated at 817,000,000 bushels as\nagainst 795,000,000 bushels harvested\nin 192 1 . Corn is estimated at 2,860,\n000,000 bushels. While this estimate\nir, less than 1920-21 crops, it is above\nthe 10 year average. It is estimated\nthat there will be 11,065,000 bales of\ncotton produced, which is 3,000,000\nbales greater than 1921 crop, but about\n1,000,000 bales less than the 10-year\naverage. The estimated potato crop\nis 428,606,000 bushels, which, if har\nvested, will be the second largest In\nthe history of the country. The pros\npects are good for a bumper crop of\nhay, the estimate being 107,000,000\ntons, which is 10 per cent greater\nthan last year and 15 per cent greater\nthan the 10-year average.

Per\nhaps the consensus of opinion Is that\nshe will not do very well, but the\nUnited States Department of Agricul\nture has some figures that show what\na few cows did that were fed on al\nfalfa hay and com silage, without\ngrain.\nA mature Holstein cow was pas\ntured on irrigated, tame grass at the\ndepartment farm at Huntley, Mont.\nDuring the winter months she received\nnothing but com silage and alfalfa\nhay. She was under test and was\nmilked three times a day. For 140.5\ndays and 98 nights she was on pas\nture. During the rest of the year she\nconsumed 9,014 pounds of alfalfa hay\nand 8,985 pounds of com silage, a\nrather large amount of bulky feed.\nWhile this ration was fed the cow\nmaintained her weight at practically\nwhat It was at the beginning of the\ntest, and produced 14,210.1 pounds of\nmilk and 470.24 pounds of butterfat.\nFor the 12 months following the\nnext freshening this same cow was\nmilked three times a day and given,\nIn addition to roughage, all the grain\nshe would eat. The surprising fact\nIs that she ate 7,056 pounds of grain\nand practically the same amount of\nroughage as before. The actual quan\ntities of roughage were 10,003 pounds\nof alfalfa hay, 8,325 pounds of silage\nand 4,230 pounds of beets. She was\non pasture 130 days and no nights.\nThe milk production for the year was\n25,499.4 pounds, and butterfat 823.11\npounds, and the gain In weight 200\npounds.\nBut notice the difference In the nu\ntrients required to produce the prod\nuct the first year and the second year,\nwhen 75 per cent more butterfat was\nproduced. The first year, over and\nabove maintenance and In addition to\npasture, the cow consumed for each\n100 pounds of butterfat 156.37 pounds\nof digestible protein and 558.69 pounds\nof total digestible nutrients, and for\neach 1,000 pounds of milk yielded she\nused 51.7 pounds of digestible protein\nand 184.8 pounds of total digestible\nnutrients.\nThe second year, when she received\nall the grain she would eat, she re\nceived above maintenance and In ad\ndition to pasture, In the production of\n100 pounds of butterfat, 218.7 pounds\noi digestible protein uml 1074.4 pounds\nSEE\nA Record-Breaking Holstein Cow.\nof total digestible nutrients; and In\nthe production of 1,000 pounds of milk\nshe used 70.43 pounds of digestible\nprotein and 345.9 pounds of total di\ngestible nutrients. ,\nFrom a nutrition Standpoint the\ncow made a more economical use of\nthe roughage ration than of the rough\nage plus heavy grain ration. No at\ntempt was made to compare the rel\native economy of the two systems of\nfeeding on a dollars-and-cents basis,\nas the relation between prices of\nroughage, grain, milk, and butterfat,\nwhich vary by localities and seasons,\nwould be a large factor In determining\nthis question.\nThere are now several cows on this\nfarm that have records made on rough\nGoat Team Dedicating the Giacier Trail\nV ".v\nThis team of billy goats hitched to a diminutive prairie schooner is traveling over the Glacier Trail from\n8t.

Another\ncow In the herd made 345 pounds of\nbutterfat In 245 days without grain,\nand still another 195 pounds In 120\ndays. It Is now planned to try some\nof them on moderate grain rations to\nmake comparisons of the amounts of\nnutrients required to make butterfat\nand milk under all conditions.\nLater and more complete figures on\nadditional cows will show the efTect\non production of three plans of nu\ntrition—no gruin ration, light grain\nration, and heavy grain ration. The\nrelative prices of milk, butterfat, and\nfeed will then determine the method\nof feeding most profitable for a given\nsection.\nrani\nusa\nSTARVE MITES IN HEN HOUSE\nIn Tests Made Parasites Were Still\nAlive After 113 Days In Aban\ndoned Building.\n(Prepared by th« United State« Department\nof Affiiculture.)\nIt takes several months to starve the\nmites In an Infested chicken house af\nter the poultry has been removed. In\ntest made by the United States\'* De\npartment of Agriculture some mites\nwere still alive after 118 days In an\nabandoned hen house. The nests In\ndicated, too, that the mites live longer\nIn damp locations than In very dry\nconditions, which accounts, In part at\nleast, for the Idea that mites are worse\nIn damp, badly ventilated houses.\nThe only way to get rid of these\npests Is to break up their hiding\nplaces. Dust baths will not control\nthem. Roosts should be taken down,\nand all unnecessary boards removed.\nIn badly infested houses the mites are\nto be found everywhere. Including the\nroof. For small coops a hand atomizer\nwill do for applying Insecticides such\nas sprays, but for larger houses a\nbucket pump, knapsack sprayer, or\nbarrel pump Is desirable. A rather\ncoarse spray should be applied from\nall angles, and driven thoroughly Into\nall the cracks. The floor also should be\ntreated, as many mites fall to the floor\nwhen roosts are being removed.\nCommercial carbollneum, which con\nsists essentially of a high-grade an\nthracene oil, has proved very effective\nagainst mites. The killing power of\nthis substance, which Is derived from\ncoal tar, lasts for several months, and\nmites which may be Inclined to come\nIn from other bnlldlngs are repelled\nfor a long time.

Both of these materials\ncan be sprayed better If reduced with\nkerosene at the rate of about 1 part\nof kerosene to 3 parts of the other\nmaterials. Both often contain foreign\nparticles which should be strained be\nfore the spraying Is begun.\nIt has been found that one spray\ning with either of these materials\noften will completely eradicate the\nmites, but ordinarily It Is advisable\nto make a second application In a\nmonth, and In some cases a third treat\nment Is needed.

Is well adapted to a variety of\nsoils and crops and Is growing rapidly\nIn public favor. As described in\nFarmers\' Bulletin 1248, "Tbe Border\nMethod of Irrigation," prepared by\nSamuel Fortier and now issued by the\nUnited States Department of Agricul\nture, the method consists essentially\nIn the division of the field to be Irri\ngated Into a series of strips, lands, or\nbeds, as they are variously termed, by\nlow, flat levees extending usually in\nthe direction of the steepest slope.\nSufficient water Is turned Into the up\nper end of each strip and allowed to\nmove down the slope In a thin sheet,\nmoistening the soil to a given depth\nas It advances toward the lower end.\nCrops Suited for Irrigation.\nIt seldom pays, It Is said, to prepare\na field for the border method for one\ncrop. The method Is well adapted to\nthe Irrigation of alfalfa, clover and\nother forage crops, as well ss all\ngrains, and the forage crops may be\nrotated with the grains without mod\nifying the method. It is also possible\nto Irrigate potatoes, sugar beets and\nother rowed and cultivated crops by\nmaking a slight change in the borders,\nso that the latitude as to rotation is\nrather wide.\nThe most favorable soil for borders\nIs a free-working loam several feet\ndeep, underlain by a more or less im\npervious subsoil. As the sheet of wa\nter flows down each strip, the pervious\ntop soli is readily moistened and the\nheavier soil beneath prevents the\nwaste of water by deep percolation.\nBorders are also very generally used\nwhere the subsoil as well as the top\nlayer of sol] is porous, not because\nM\nmi\n& -w\nm\n> ■\nurn\n> ^\nMH\ntm\ni\n\' \'A.» \'»«4 4/,/- i\nmmt\nApplying Water to Land by Method !\nThat Ceuld Be More Generally\nAdopted in Eastern Farming Sections.\nsuch formations are the most favor\nable but because no other method will\ndo as well.\nThe cost of preparing land for the\nborder method is low as compared\nwith that required for most other\nmethods if the physical conditions are\nfavorable. At the same time it Is usu\nally feasible to obtain a fair crop at\nsmall cost by the use of temporary\nborders, and after the crop is harvest\ned, the making of permanent borders\nmay be undertaken without undoing\nmuch of the previous season\'s work.\nSlopes Are Essential.\nA smooth, regular surface having a\nslope In one direction of about 2.5\nInches to the hundred feet may be re\ngarded as ideal for tbe border method\nof Irrigation. It is possible to make\nborders on slopes one Inch or less to\nthe hundred feet and on steeper slopes\nup to 2 feet and more per hundred.\nBorders have been used on slopes as |\ngreat as 7% feet to the hundred feet,\nbut extra care must then be taken to\nprevent soil and crop erosion.\nThe amount of water that can be\nturned Into the strip depends on the\nsize of each strip, its slope, and other\nconditions. In narrow, short strips\nthe head used may be reduced to half\na cubic foot a second or from 20 to\n25 miners\' Inches, and In wide, long\nstrips 10 cubic feet a second may be\nnone too large. A large volume of\nwater cannot be handled successfully\non steep slopes, but it is always pos\nsible to divide a head between two or\nmore compartments.\nFull details of the construction and\noperation of borders are contained in\nthe bulletin, copies of which may be\nhad free by writing to the United\nStates Department of Agriculture,\nWashington, D.

The number of males mqy\nhe reduced to one for every seven fe\ninales about the first of March, and\nagain changed a month\'later to one\nmale for eight to ten females.\nActive, healthy females of medium\nsize should be used for breeding ; that\nis, weighing about eight pounds when\nmature. Only mature birds should be\nused as breeders. Select ducks with\nshort necks, medium long bodies, flat\nbacks and of good depth to the keel\nbones. Watery eyes usually are a sign\nof weakness in ducks. The drake Is\ncoarser and more masculine In appear\nance than the duck, and has a distinct\ncurl In his tail feathers. Ducks should\nma\nDucks Should Be Sold After They Are\nTwo Year* Old.\nbe sold, usually, after they are two\nyears old, although the best breeders\nor layers may be kept over tbelr third\nyear, say poultry specialists in the\nUnited States Department of Agricul\nture.\nIn handling ducks, pick them up by\ntheir necks, as their legs are very eas\nily broken. Ducks lay their eggs\nearly In the morning, and should be\nconfined to the house or pen until 9:30\nor 10 o\'clock in the morning. If al\nlowed to roam early In the morning\nthey may lay in a pond or stream and\nthe eggs may be lost\nDAIRY\nPOINTS\nGIVjj- PUREBREDS MORE CARE\nDairyman Often Take& More Interest\nin High Class Stock Because\nof Possibilities.\n(Prepared by the United States Department\nof Agriculture.)\nThere Is no good reason why It\nshould cost more to care for a good\nherd of purebred dairy cows than It\ncosts to care for the same number of\ngood grades, although farmers some\ntimes believe that the purebreds are\nmore expensive to keep.

Selling direct to the\nconsumer is believed by poultry spe\ncialists of the United States Depart\nment of Agriculture to be the most\nprofitable method of disposing of high\ngrade goods, for the charges of the\nmiddlemen are eliminated. Very often\nthe producer is situated so that he can\nbuild up a retail trade among the\nfamilies of a neighboring town or city,\ndelivering his goods once or twice a\nweek, or oftener If desired. In this\nway he can obtain a substantial in\ncrease over prices paid in the open\nmarket. Especially is this true in the\ncase of strictly fresli eggs. Often it\nis possible to find customers in a town\nor city within reasonable hauling dis\ntance, taking eggs and poultry to them\nat regular intervals. Hotels, restau\nrants and clubs are good customers\nwhich can be supplied in this way by\ncontract.\nOften there are grocery and provi\nsion dealers catering to a select trade\nto whom the producer can sell régulai\nsupplies of eggs and poultry. Of\ncourse, the simplest way to sell prod\nuce Is through the commission mer\nchant. It does away with expense\n4 4\n. *\nPlucked and Ready for Consumer.\nand trouble of private trades, but the\nreturns usually are not so large, ex\ncept when dealing with certain com\nmission houses that have built up a\nfine trade along certain lines. The De\npartment of Agriculture has several\nbulletins covering the subject of mar\nketing poultry. Farmers\' Bulletin 830,\nShipping Eggs by Parcel Post, may be\nhad free upon application to the di\nvision of publications ; Farmers\' Bul\nletin 528, Hints to Poultry Raisers, 5\ncents; Department Bulletin 561, Feed\nCost of Egg Production, price 10 cents,\nmay be ordered of the superintendent\nof documents, government printing of\nfice, Washington.\nDAIRY\nFACTS\nQUALITY OF MARKET BUTTER\nDepartment of Agriculture Offer*\nCommission Man Court of\nLast Resort.\n(Prepared by the United States Department\nof Agriculture.)\nIn £he past buttermakers have often\nbeen In the dark as to the real quality\nof the butter they put upon the mar\nket, and frequently they feel that they\nhave not been fairly treated by com\nmission men and others In the mar\nkets. But the creamery man is not\nwithout friends, for the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture offers him\nStirring and Takinj Temperature of\nCream.\nan inspection service that stands al\nmost as a court of Inst resort. Any\nperson who wants this service may\nhave it by applying for It. The gov\nernment Inspectors examine butter In\ncars, in storage, or In stores, and the\ncertificates they issue stand In court,\nbut they seldom get that far, as they\nare almost universally accepted.\nAt the National Dairy show, which\nwas held In St. Paul, Minn., October 8\nto 15, butter Inspectors showed how\nthey do their work, and exhibits that\nhave been prepared by the depart\nment showed the great advantage that\ncomes from marketing butter of a higli\ngrade. On the face of It butter that\nscores 88 would not seem to be much\ninferior to that which scores 92, but it\nwas shown that the spread of price be\ntween those two grades is very large,\nfar greater than the difference In cost\nof manufacture. As Poor Richard\nmight have said : "A little better but\nter makes a much bigger bank bal\nance."\nMAKE BETTER SWISS CHEESE\nMethod Developed by Department of\nAgriculture Has Passed Into\nCommercial Stage.\nThe method of making Swiss cheese\nwith purified and controlled bacterial\ncultures, developed by the dairy di\nvision of the United States Depart\nment of Agriculture, has now passed\ndefinitely Into the commercial stage.\nThis new process wns worked out In\nthe dairy laboratories, given thorough\ntrials in the experimental cheese fac\ntory operated by the dairy division at\nGrove City. Pn.. and is now being used\nby a number of commercial factories\nin various parts of the country.\nThe results obtained by two Ohio\nfactories indicate that It will be\nworth while for those Interested In\nthe manufacture of Swiss cheese to\nadopt the method and give it a fair\ntrial. For the cheese made in June\nof tills year one of these factories\nreceived a straight price of 34 \'/»\ncents a pound ; the other factory, 30\ncents. At the same time other fac\ntories in this area received from 20\nto 22 cents.

For the July product, one of\nthe factories received 30 cents for\nfancies and No. 1 and 27 cents for No.\n2. The old-system factories received\nthe same price as for June cheese.\nThe principal reason the buyers\nwere willing to pay this margin over\nthe general run of chepse made In\nthe locality was that the percentage\nof high-grade cheese had been greatly\nIncreased.\nASCERTAIN RECORD OF BULL\nWhen Making Purchase Insist Upon\nKnowing Yearly Milk Production\nof Its Dam.\nWhen buying a bull insist upon\nknowing the yearly milk production of\nhis dam and the average per cent of\nbutterfat. A seven-day record is of\nlittle value in determining the actual\ndairy worth of a cow, for by good\nhandling it is possible to greatly In\ncrease her percentage of butterfat.\nTO AVOID POULTRY DISEASES\nHealth of Fowls Depends Almost\nEntirely Upon Clean Quarters\nand Right Feed.\nMany people who raise poultry\nspend money for remedies for ail\nments in their flock which they could\nprevent If they would realize that the\nhealth of poultry depends almost en\ntirely upon clean quarters and proper\nfeeding.\nFew poultry diseases are caused\nby anything but lnck of precaution.\nA leaky roof causes damp litter. Lack\nof litter under roosts causes a damp\nand foui house under a good roof.\nCracks In the floor or sides mean\ndrafts. Lack of clean scratch Utter\nmeans lack of exercise and reduced\nvigor.\nLack of balanced rations means a\ntendency towards digestive troubles.\nNo grit helps to keep feed from be\ning properly digested. Too tight quar\nters cause them to become damp,\nfoul-smelling and unhealthful. Lack\nof ventilation causes poultry to lose\nIn vitality. Colds are caused by dusty\nhouses and exposure to moisture and\ncold.\nH. D.

At this\ntime the demand In the city markets\nis for young birds weighing from one\nto two pounds each. At about two and\none-half months old guineas weigh\nfrom one to one and one-half pounds,\naud at this size they begin reaching\nthe markets In August.
