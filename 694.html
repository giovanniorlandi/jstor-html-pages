So if later we announce an increased\nscale of prices don\'t say de didn\'t give you a\nchanée 4\nOPPORTUNITY.\nIn the early days of the petroleum discoveries\na Pennsylvania, lured by the fortunes being made\nover-night in the county next to his, sold his farm\nand moved to what seemed to be the more favored\nregion.He taught land that never produced any\noil at all, ana was not good for anything else.\nThe purchaser of his farm took his cattle be\nhind the barn to water in a brook his predecessor\nhad partly boarded up so as to divert the flow of\nobnoxious scum that polluted the water. This\nhad caused the former owner trouble for\nle\nan\nscum\nmore than 20 years. He had not been able to get\nrid of it. He had tried hard, but failed.\nThat scum was petroleum. That stream near Tor\nTitusville has since poured hundreds of million of J\ndollars into the pockets of its owners. |\nWe may not all be able to find petroleum in our\nhog lot or cow pasture, but there is an equally\ngrçat and gratifying find in store for us if we can\nsound the depths of our own intelligence—if we\ncan, through reading and study, discover the pecu\nliar calling for which nature has skillfully adapted\neach of us.\nThat Pennsylvanian who did not know petro\nleum when for 20 years he was trying to get rid\nof it as a nuisance was not destined for success\nin petroleum producing.\nA large part of opportunity lies in preparation.\nThe mind must be fitted to meet it.\nV Few indeed are the men, Americans at least,\nwho have never felt an irresistable impulse to\nforge ahead, to become leaders in some profession.\nSuch men, if they follow that impulse along the\nroad of preparation, are pretty sure to reach their\ngoal.\nThey can attain their ambition, not merely\nchanging one place for another, but by diligent,\npersistent, determined endeavor and unremitting\nstudy of the profession of business they would\nmaster.\nNOTHING BUT PARADE SOLDIERS.\nThe war department has given out for publica-!\ntion the names of 800 milita officers whose re- 1\nsituations have been accepted since the State\ntroops wove stationed on the Mexican border. And I\nthis list, loner as it was, did not include the names !.\nof the other officers who have applied for release, 1\n• it for one reason or another have not yet been\nallowed to return to civil life.\nThis is a serio-comic affair. Think of the oc\ncasions in which these tin soldiers have paraded\nbefore the public of their native towns uniformed\nto kill but with no idea of fighting if war came.\nWe think there should be a law prohibiting those\nwho stay in the militia, whether officers, privates,\nor attendants, from resigning when trouble comes.\nif a man joins the militia and becomes an of\nfice! he should take his medicine when it becomes\nnecessary to serve his country on the border.\nOtherwise he had no business joining it at the\noutset. Having stayed in it for 3ome time the\ngovernment should not be deprived of his servi\nces when they are needed. A law to this effect\nwould be very proper in our opinion. More than\nthis, it is not fair to require privates to serve and\nto allow officers to escape service by resigning.—\nExchange.\n*\nARE YOU THE DEBTOR.\n-\nIt makes not a bit of difference who you are or °*\nwhat you are, Greenwood has done more for you P\nthan.you have done for Greenwood. You may\nbe rich, or you may be poor, or just in moderate\ncircumstances, but in either case your home town i\nhas done much for you that you have never rec\nognized or repaid.

Using\nthe losses of the Allies on the Somme and assum\ning that the ofTense loses double the loss of the\ndefenders it is estimated that Germany lost 260,\n000 men on the Somme fighting while the Allies\nj Qst t w i ce a8 man y divided between Great Britain\nand France as four to one.\nThe German losses at Verdun are fixed at 500,\n000 and the French at one-half that total. You\nsee then that while Germany has lost in those\nchief engagements 750,000 men, that the British\nhave lost 400,000 and the French 350,000. The\nwhole loss is about equal, but the Allied losses\nwere divided and the Germans have borne all those\non her side. Allowing for German losses in the\nLast where severe fighting has taken place, it\nis reasonably sure that her losses cam be figured\nat 1,000,000.\nThen you see that while Great Britain has\nlost 400,000. France a like quantity and Russia a\nlittle less, totalling about 1,200,000, the German\nlosses have been 1,000,000. This she has suffered\nalone. She has no partner to share the loss. This\n\'is the policy of attrition,\nj It will work and win if the Allies keep pound\nj ing long enough. The only question is, will they,\nThey say, yes; but, Germany, on the other hand,\nsays her resources in men are great enough to\na outlast all conceivable attacks by the Allies,\nj Whoever is right will win the war. The ques\ntion can only settle itself. To-day cannot ans\nwer, but to-morrow will decide,\nWE NEED A GOVERNMENT YARD.\nThe navy authorities seem to be having some\ntrouble in getting bidders for new scout cruisers\nand other ships authorized by the last congress.\nIt seems that the prices of labor and materials\nvary so widely from time to time that few com\nI anies will make a straight-out bid within the re\nquirements of the act. It is expected that con\ngress will be asked to increase the cost limit on\nsome of the ships in order to get them built in\nprivate yards.\nThis leads us to the proposition of a govern\nment ship-building plant. We think the navy\nought to have its own plant and that the United\nStates ought to build its own warships. These\nyards of course ought to be equipped for their\nwork and be enabled to turn out ships as fast as\nany private yard. Then whenever congress pass\ned a bill for the increase of our navy we might\nbe able to get the ships, without having to wait\non private concerns to decide whether they would\nprefer to build commercial ships for others or\nwarships for us.\na\nIf you want a Sunday dinner that would tick\nle the palate of a king just tell your wife she is\nthe most popular woman and the best cook in\ntown.

It is\nall the result of a dress suit trust and\nthe grave danger of the rental price\nof "open face" clothes going up. The\nGreater New York Full Dress Suit\nParlor Association is in process of for\nI mation. Because of the large number\nj of balls and socials which are to be\nheld on the East side during the com\ning winter the youths of that section\nwho scorn to attend an evening affair\nwithout the conventional attire are in\n1\ndignant against the advances. They\nsay that the rentals are high enough\nnow. It is reported the new trust will\ndecide on 82 as the rental of a full\ndress suit.\n\'Why not?" the dealers\nThe price of everything else\nsay.\nhas gone up and dress suits should be\nno exception.\'\nT. & P.

Three barrels of\noil will do the work of one ton of coal.\nA merchant vessel can save one a day\nby the use of oil because of the rapidi\nty with which supplies can be taken\nin.

May we depend upon you to\ntake the matter up in your community\nand interest, with you, such others as\nwill push the work, and will you, with\ntoo\nthem, see all the people in your com-1\nmunity and give them a chance to con\ntribute liberally to this car? !\nThe car plan is a great success\nwhere it is well worked. On account\nof the boll weevil and other conditions\nin certain sections of our State, the\ncontributions will necessarily be cut\noff, so we shall need to make an extra\neffort for contributions in money and\nprovisions for our orphan children.\nIn the two orphanages we hâve\nl ,j . . . ,\nthan 450 children to be fed,\nclothed and warmed. Besides what\nmoney you can give, they can use any\nthing to eat or wear, for girls or boys\n1 from 2 to 16 years old. Get your peo\npie to send molasses, corn, flour, su- 1\ngar, grits, cured meats, lard, all kinds\nof canned goods, all kinds of dishes,\nand b ° XeS ° f c,othing \' shoes \' hats \'\nhose, elastic, soap, pins, needles,\nj\nmore\nthread, buttons, pencils, tablets, quilts,\nblankets, sheets, pillowcases and\ntowels.\nThe railroads are better pleased\n4 when we fill the cars well, and so are\n°ur orphan children.
