Many a man thinks or claims that, he thinks, that France ought to supply all her fighters and ours with food., Heretofore, they say. armies lived off the country in which they fought., What may be true of the past is not true of toda.\'s war., How much food could we raise or would we raise, if a vietorjyplia, Herman army was twenty miles away, pressing hard upon us to come, here where we are today? And if the French sent an army over to help, us hold hack the enemy, how could we feed them, if we could not feed, ourselves? What use would the French army he unless they brought, their supplies with them?, Remember that the French are fighting with their hack to the ocean., Thus the supplies that they get must come from over ..., I hen there are others who will sav, if we have to feed the fighters, i in France, why not feed them on corn and tin- foods that are plentiful,, and let us at home have the (lour and the sugar., Fork is the heat giver, sugar the stimulant, and both are necessary, , to the life and health of the soldier., 0, They do more, than please the taste—, Chesterfield, CIGARETTES, of IMPORTED and DOMESTIC tobaccos-Blended, *, KENNY HOLDEN\'S, Pool and Billiard Parlors, CIGARS, SOFT DRINKS AND TOBACCO, FIRST-CLASS BARBER SHOP, IN CONNECTION, MUSIC EVERY NIGHT PHONE 15, CLASSIFIED, Advertising, WANTED—Girl for general house, work. \\pply Mrs Calvin Ha/.e|*i, WANTED—A tool dresser and cook, lor George Morris, < amp 7.

Suppose I should, run Into a German sentry beforo I, succeeded In getting one?, I decided that until I reached the, big city which the Belgian had men, tioned—and which I cannot name for, fear of Identifying some of the people, here who befriended me—I would, proceed with the utmost precaution., Since I had discarded my uniform, and had obtained civilian clothes. I, had not been quite as careful as I was, at first. While I had done my trav, eling at night. I had not gone Into, hiding so early in the morning as, before and I had sometimes started, again before It was quite dark, rely, ing upon the fuct that I would prob, ably be mistaken for a Belgian on his, way to or from work, as the case, might be. From now on. I resolved,, however, I would take no more, chances., That evening I came to a river per, haps seventy-five yards wide and I, was getting ready to swim It when I, thought I would walk a little way to, find. If possible, a better place to get, to the river from the bank. I hud not, walktsl more than a few hundred, yards when I saw a boat. It was the, first time I had seen a boat In all my, experience*., It was firmly chained, but ns the, stakes were sunk In the soft bunk It, was not much of a Job to pull them, out, I got In, drank to my heart\'s, pQpp?nt, shoved over to the other side,, Hi but. drove a stake Into tin* ground, and moored the boat. It would have, been n simple matter to have drifted, down the river, hut tin* river was not, shown on the map and I had no Idea, where it might lead me. Very reluc, tantly, therefore, I had to abandon, the boat and proceed on foot., I made several miles that night and, before daylight found a safe place in, which to hide for the day. From my, hiding place l could see through the, bushes a heavy thick wood only a, short distance away. I decided that, I would start earlier than usual, hurry, i—mm—t H, Last Photograph Taken of Lieutenant, O’Brien Before Hia Capture. With, Him la Hla Chum, Ueuttnant Raney., over to the wood and perhaps. In that, way. I cauld cover two or three miles, In the daytime and gain Just so much, time. Traveling through the wood, would be comparatively prfe. Thuro, was a railroad going rarongh ftio, wood, but I did not figure that that, would make It any the less safe., About three o’clock that afternoon,, therefore, I emerged from mg hiding, place and hurried Into tte wood., AfWT proceeding for half a mllo or, ao I carne to the railroad. I tortt a, sharp look In both directions and see, ing no signs of trains or soldiers. 1, walked boldly over tho tracks and, continued on my way., I soon came upon a clearing and, knew that someone must be living In, the vicinity. As 1 turned n group of, trees I saw a small house and In the, distance an old man working In n, garden. 1 decided to enter the houso, and ask for food, figuring the woman, would probably be old and would he, no match for me even If she proved, hostile. The old woman who came, to tlie do-\'r in response to my knock, was older than I expected. If she, wasn\'t close to a hundred, 1 miss my, guess very much., She could not speak English nnd l, could not speak Flemish, of course,, but nevertheless I made her under, stand that I wanted something to eat., She came out of the door and hol, loed for her husband In a shrill voice, that would have done credit to a girl, of eighteen. The old nmn dime hi, from the garden and between the two, of them they managed to get the Idea, that I was hungry nnd they gave me, a piece of bread—a very small piece—, which was quite u treat., The house they lived Iu consisted of, Just two rooms—the kitchen and a, bedroom. The kitchen was perhaps, fourteen feet square, eight feet of, one side being taken up by an enor, mous fireplace. What was in the bed, room I had no way of telling, as I, did not dare to be too Inquisitive., I made the old couple understand, that I would like to stay In their house, all night, but the old man shook his, head. I hade them good-by and dis, appeared into the woods, leaving them, to speculate as to the strange for, eigner they had entertained., From the great density of the popu, lation In this section through which I, was now passing I realized that I, must be in the outskirts of the big, city which the Belgian had mentioned, and where I was to procure a pass, port., Village nfter village intercepted me,, and although I tried to skirt them, wherever possible I realized that I, would never make much progress If, I continued that course. To gain a, mile I would sometimes have to make, u detour of two or three. I decided, that I would try my lu< k In going, straight through the next village I, came to., As I approached It. I passed num, bers of peasants who were ambling, along the road. I was afraid to mingle, with them because it >vas impossible, for one to talk to them and It was, dangerous to arouse suspicion even, among the Belgians. For all I knew,, one of them might be treacherous, enough to deliver me to the Germans, In return for the reward he might be, sure of receiving., About 9 o\'clock that evening I, came to a point where ahead of me on, the right was a Belgian police station, i —I knew it from Its red lights—and, on tlie other side of the street were, two German soldiers In uniform, leaning against a bicycle., Here was a problem which called, for instant decision; If I turned hack, the suspicion of the soldiers would, he Instantly aroused and If I crossed, the road so as not to pass so closely, to them they might be equally sus, picious. I decided to march bravely, by the Huns, bluff my way through, and trust to Providence. If anybody, imagines, however, that I was at nil, comfortable as I approached these, soldiers, ho must think I am a much, , braver man than 1 claim to be. My, heart heat so loud I was ufrald they, would hear It. Every step I took, brought me so much nearer to what, might prove to be the end of all my, hopes. It was a nerve-racking ordeal., I was now within a few feet of, rnem. Anotner step mm—, They didn\'t turn a hair! I passed, right by them—heard what they were, snylng. although, of course I dldD\'t, understand It, and went right on. I, can\'t say I didn\'t walk a little faster, as I left them behind, but 1 tried to, maintain an even gait so as not to, give them any Idea of the Inward ex, ultation I was experiencing. No words, can explain, however, how relieved I, really felt—to know that I had suc, cessfully passed through the first of, u series of similar tests which I real, ized were In store for me—although, I did not know then how soon I was, to bo confronted with the second., As it was, however, the Incident, gave me a world of confidence. It, demonstrated to me that there was, nothing In my appearance nt any rate, to attract the attention of the Herman, soldiers. Apparently I looked like a, Iielglun peasant, and If could only, work things so that I would never, have to answer questions and thus, give away my nationality, I figured I, would be tolerably safe., As I marched along I felt so happy, I couldn\'t help humming an air of one, of the new patriotic songs that we, used to sing at the airdrome buck In, Ypres., In this happy frame of mind I cov, ered the next three miles In about an, hour and then came to another little, village. My usual course would have, he*\'ll to go around It—through fields,, hark yards, woods or whatever else, I lay In my way—hut I had gained so, much time by going through the lust, village Instead of detouring around, It and my appearance seemed to be so, unsuspicious that I decided to try the, ! same stunt again., I stopped humming and kept very, ; much on the alert, but apart from, that, I walked boldly through the, main street without any feeling of, alarm., I had proceeded perhaps n mile, along the main street when I noticed, ahead of me three German soldiers, standing at the curb., Again my heart spurted to beat fust., I must confess, but l was not nearly, so scared as I hud been an hour or, so before., I walked ahead, determined to fol, low my previous procedure In every, particular., I had got to about fifteen feet away, from the soldiers when one of them, stepped onto the sidewalk and, shotted:, “Halt I", My heart stopped beating fast—for, a moment, I believe, It stopped beating, altogether! I can\'t attempt to de, scribe my feelings. I thought that, the Jig was up—that all I had gone, through und all I had escaped would, now avail me nothing, mingled with, the feeling of disgust with my, self because of the foolish risk I, had taken in going through the vil, lage, combined to take all the starch, out of me, and I could feel myself, wilting ns the soldier advanced to the, spot where 1 stood rooted lu my, tracks., 1 hud a bottle of water In oae pocket, and a piece of bread In tho other, and, ns the Hun ndvuuccd to search me I, held the bottle up In one band und, the piece of bread In the other ao that, he could see that was all 1 Imd., It occurred to me that he would, “frlak" me—that Is, feel me over for, arms or other weapons, then place, (ns tinder arrest and march me off to, the guardhouse. I had not the slight, est idea but that I was cnptur *1 and, there didn\'t seem to he much use in, resisting, unarmed :is I was and with, two other German soldiers within a, few feet of US., Like a flash it suddenly dawned on, me, however, that for all this soldier, could have known I was only a Bel, gian peasant and that Ills object in, searching me, which be proceeded to, do, was to ascertain whether I had, committed the common “crime” of, smuggling potatoes., The Belgians were allowed only a, certain amount of potatoes, and it is, against the laws laid down by the, Huns to deal in vegetables of any, kind except under the rigid supervi, sion of the authorities. Nevertheless,, it was one of the principal vocations, of the average poor Belgian to buy, potatoes out in the country from, peasants and then smuggle them into, the large cities and sell them clan, destinely at a high price., To stop this trathe in potatoes, the, German soldi* rs were in the habit of, subjecting the Belgians to frequent, search, and I was being held up by, this soldier for no other reason than, that be thought I might be a potato, smuggler!, He felt of my outside clothes and, pockets, and finding no potatoes, seemed to be quite satisfied. Had be, but known who I was lie could have, earned an iron cross! < >r, perhaps, in, view of tin* fact that I lutd a heavy, water bottle in my uplifted hand, it, might have turned out. to be a wooden, cross!, which, of course, I <1 Id riot understand,, and then some Belgian peasants came, along and seemed to distract his atten, tion. Perhaps tie had said : “It\'s all, right; you may go on," or he may, have been talking to the others In, Flemish, but at any rate, observing, that he was more interested In the, others than he was In me at the mo, ment, I put the bottle In my [rocket, and walked on., After I walked a few steps, I took a, furtive glume buckwurd and noticed, the soldier who had searched me re, join his comrades at the curb and then, stop another fellow who had come, along, and then I disappeared In the, darkness., I cannot say that the outcome of, this adventure left #me In the same, coutldent frame of mind that followed, the earlier one. I was sure I had, come out of It all right, but I could, not help thinking what a terribly close, shuve I hud., Suppose the soldier hud questioned, me! The ruse I had been following, in my dealings with the Belgian peas, ants—pretending I was deuf and, dumb—might possibly hnve worked, here, too, but a soldier—a German, soldier—might not so easily have been, fno!e<t It was more than an even, chance that It would have at least, nrousedhls suspicion and resulted In, furtlicfwi vest Igut Ion. A search of, iny clothing would have revealed n, dozen things which would have estab, lished my identity and all my sham, ming of deafness would have availed, me nothing., As I wandered along I knew that I, was now approaching the big city, which my Belgian friend had spoken, Searched by German Guards., of and which I would have to enter, If I was to get the passport, and I, realized now how essential It was to, huve something to enable me to get, through the frequent examinations, to which I expected to bo subjected., While I was still debating In my, mind whether It was going to be pos, sible for mo to enter the city that, night, I saw In the distance what ap, peared to be an arc light, and as 1, neared tt that was what It turned out, to be. Beneath the light I could, make out the forms of three guards,, und the thought of having to go, through the same kind of ordeal that, I had Just experienced filled me with, misgivings, Was It possible thut 1, could be fortuuute enough to get by, again?, As I slowed up a little, trying to, muke up ray mind what was beat to do,, I was overtaken by a group of Bel, gran women who were shuffling along, the road, and I decided to mingle, with them and see If I couldn\'t convey, the Impression that I was one of, their party., As we approached the arc light, the, figures of those three soldiers with, tlfelr spiked helmets banned before, like a regiment. I felt as If I were, walking right Into the jaws of death., Bather than go through what was In, store for me. 1 felt that I would In, finitely prefer to he fighting again In, the air with those four desperate, Huns who had been the cause of my, present plight — then, at least, I, would have a chance to light hack,, hut now I had to risk my life and, take what was coining to me without, a chance to strike a blow in my own, defense., I shall never forget my feelings as, we runic within the shaft of light pro, jected hv that great are light nor the, faces of those three guards as we, passed by them. I didn\'t look directly, at them, hut out of tin* corner of my, < ye I never missed a detail. I held a, handkerchief up to my face as we, passed them and endeavored to Imi, tate the slouching gait of the Belgians, as well as I could, and apparently It, worked. We walked right by thorn*, guards and they paid absolutely no, attention to us., If ever a fellow felt like going down, on his knees and praylug I did at that, moment, hut It wouldn\'t have done to, | show my elation or gratitude In that, I conspicuous way., It was then well after 11 o’clock and, | I knew it would he unsafe for me to, attempt to find a lodging place in the, city, and the only thing for me to do, was to locate the man whose name the, Belgian had given me. Ife had given, me a good description of the street, and had directed me how to get there,, and I followed his instructions closely., After walking the streets for about, half an hour, 1 came upon one of tic*, landmarks my friend had described to, me and ten minutes afterwards I was, knocking at the door of the man who, was to make it possible for me to reach, Holland—and liberty I At least, that, was what I hoped., (To he Continued), -«, Twenty-four boxes of Matanuska, strawberies wore recently sold at, Anchorage In Hi minutes they being, the first home-brown berries to up, , pear on the market.
