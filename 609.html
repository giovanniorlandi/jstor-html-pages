KERSH IN THE CITY ARRANG\nING FOR CONTEST AT THE MOBILE\nMARD1 6RAS CARNIVAL\nEvery town in Mississippi has\nfrom time to time made txnst of\nhaving the mos; beautiful girl of\nall. There has never been a\nway to settle the much mooted\nquestion until now, when the\nMobile Carnival Association\ncomes forward with a proposition\nto have a "Congress of Beauty"\nas the leading mardi gras fea\nture. The suggestion is unique\nand is already creating much in\nterest. Briefly, Mobile s plan is to\nhave each of the cities and most\nprominent towns in the states of\nMississippi and Alabama select\nthrough popular vote its most\nbeautifu1 woman as queen of her\npaiticular city at the Carnival.\nThese queens will assemble in\nMobile, and from among their\nnumber a committee will select\nthe most beautiful who will be\ncrowned as "Queen of Beauty."\nThe trip will be a free one, in\ncluding hotel bills, to the lucky\nqueens, and they are to be es\npecially feted in the way of balls,\nreceptions and floral parades\nduring the three days of mirth\nmaking.\nMr. E. E. Kersh, special\nCarnival Commissioner, was in\nColumbus Wednesday arranging\nfor the contest here, and the de\ntails will appear in The Commer\ncial at an early date.\nIt is expected that from seventy-five\nto one hundred towns\nwill enter the contest.\nSteamer New Haven.\nThe first boat of the season\nlanding in Columbus was the\nsteamer New Haven, which\nrived last Monday after a\ndays\' trip, from Mobile.\nA good cargo was brought\nar-\nten\nup\nfrom different stations down the\nTombigbee, among which were\none hundred and fifty bales of\ncotton and fifteen hundred sacks\nof cotton seed.\nThe boat left early Tuesday\nmorning on her return down the\nriver, and is scheduled to arrive\nback to this point Monday.\nIt requires a proper combination of\ncertain acids with natural juices to per\nfect a dyspepsia cure. And that is\nwhat Kodol is a perfect digester that\ndigests all the food you eat. If you\nwill take Kodol for a little while you\nwill no longer have indigestion. You\nthen couldn\'t have indigestion. How\ncould yo. have indigestion if your food\nwere to v ige&t? Kodol digests all you\neat. It is pleasant to take, acts\npromptly. Sold by L. E.

Later the policy of\nthe paper will be moie clearly defined.\nTIEW\nThe New Year is with us and upon the first pages are written\nmany new and good resolutions. Of course it is net logical to hope\nthat all resolutions are carried out, but making good resolutions\nand trying to keep them makes one stronger,\nAnother mile stone has been passeda pause in life\'s turmoil\nis well- time for thought and retrospection; time to lament fail\nures and grieve over irretrievable loss, antV worst of all, realize- the\ninevitable must be borne. The omission of duty is almost over\nwhelming, and but for the fact that time goes on with rapid pace\nand the burdens of life must be borne for others, we would despair.\nThere is an abundance of sadness in the passing of the old year,\nbut there is sunshine in the thought that the world grows brighter\nand more sympathetic with each succeeding year. The financial\nout look i ; bright. Th march of education that solves every\nproblem, as well as the quickening of conscience, will set to right\nmany wrongs, and all together the year opens with roseate hue.\nMay the year 1909 be full of light to clear away, gloom, and\nrich in blessing for all, especially the readers of this paper.\nCHRISTMAS ISN\'T DYING OUT.\n"Christmas is dying out; it has lost its distinctiveness as a\nChristian festival, soon it will be obsolet" so says one of the\nlatter-day prophets.\nDo you believe it? Is it possible that our one perfect holiday\nshall pass? We have but three anniversaries of national commem\noration. Fourth of July is a military jubilee, marred by the din of\nfire-crackers and the symbols of bloodshed. Thanksgiving is a\nastronomical festival associated with guillotined turkeys and din\nners that tax digestion.\nChristmas calls a halt to the busy cities in his rush after gain\nand turns his thoughts back to childhood and halts forgotten ties;\nso that the old parents in the country home are gladdened by a\nletter and a gift from the son who is still their "boy" to them.\nNo; Christmas is not growing obsolete. It will live and take\non fuller meaning. The spirit of Christ is now being better un\nderstood and assimilated than ever before. Chairity Js broader\nand more wisely beneficent, and the sense of human brotherhood\nis more vital and more productive of co-operation and strength.\nMaty K. Bryan, In Uncle Remus\'s The Home Magazine for\nDecember.\nParents, what is your supreme duty in life? Is it to make\nmoney? Is it merely to eat, sleep, drink, die and be forgotten?\nCo look into the beautiful faces of your own sweet little boys and\ngirls, notice the intelligence beaming from their little eyes, think\nof the vast possibilities that God has locked up in their little souls\nto which he has given you the key, realize the sublime faith that\nthese little ones have in papa and mamma, then answer the ques\ntion. Cod has given to each individual two parents and he must\nhave meant for the responsibility of training to rest alike upon\neach, but how often the duty becomes a burden when it falls upon\none and God\'s plans are disconcerted. "A house devided cannot\nstand." Let parents agree upon a course that will bring out the\nhighest and best, and by concerted action help them to build\ncharacter that will fit them for their best lines, for the State and\nfor God.\nii\nSWIM OR\n"The captain of a coasting-steamer which was wrecked near\nSydney, N.

Brother Senter re\nceived the first Grand Lodge\nrecognition in 1900 and later in\n1905 he was elected Grand\nChancellor and served during\nthat year closing a very splendid\nadministrative year when the\nGrand Lodge met in May, 1906,\nin Jackson. Brother Senter was\na member of the Order Knights\nof Pythias, the Odd Fellows and\nthe Masons, all of whom partici\npated in the last sad rites He\nleaves a widow, four girls and\ntwo sons to mourn his loss.\nIt has been said that \'the evil\nmen do lives after them, the\ngood is often interred with their\nbones." This in our day of civ\nilization and refinement; in our\nday when the better element\nprevails, in fact in this, the best\nday of the world\'s history, such\na doctrine does not prevail for\nthe reason that it should not\nprevail. Today we should say\n"the good that men do lives after\nthem let the evil be interred with\ntheir tones, " so we should say\nof Brother Senter. The writer\nwould not say that he was with\nout faults, yes, he was human\nand being human he wTas frail,\nbut the good in his character so\nover balanced that which was\nfaulty that we like to remember\nhim for his good qualities and\nforget those things that showed\nhis weakness. Loving to his\nfamily and as an evidence of his\nnobility of character he w as idol\nized by them as a friend, and his\nfriends were indeed close to him;\nintelligent as a law maker, and\nhi3 constituents never had a\nmore zealous advocate; courage\nous as a man, and no man was\never truer to his convictions,\ni ii it . i .\nand this all being undeniable\ntrue; so the life of such a man\ncannot fail to. leave its impress\nI good in the community and\nOtate in ttrViiVn\nhe lived, and\nD G!!A!!CELL\nSETTER DEAD\nwhen we today as Pythians, pay\na tribute to the memory of J hn\nr. benter we stand as nrm as\nthe defenders of the qualities of\ncourage and nobility of character\nand emulate that which is good\nand noble. The writer valued\nhim as a friend. Not long since\nit was the writer\'s pleasure to\nindite a letter of recommenda\ntion and endorsement of Brother\nSenter when he expected to\ntake a trip out West for his\nhealth and we are glad that\nwhile he was living the occasion\narose when we could express our\nopinion of him as a man, we\nwere willing for him to go to\nstrangers with this endorse\nment we gave him, and now that\nhe is dead we can but reiterate\nwhat we said of him when he\nwas in the flesh.\nThe Pythians throughout Mis\nsissippi will regret to learn of\nBrother Senter\'s death and all\njoin with me in saying that we\nhope with all our hearts that\nwhen his soul arrived at the\nPearly Gates Above that the\nPass Word he was able to give\nwas acceptable to the Supreme\nChancellor of the Universe and\nthat he dwells in happiness and\nwith the Throngs in the Mansions\nAbove.\nHILLRIE M. QUIN,\nIN MEMORIAM.\nAmid the peals of merriment\nand rippling laughter, as we\nwere about to celebrate the\nNineteen Hundred and Eighth\nanniversary of the birth of our\nSavior, we were suddenly inter\nrupted to view the opposite\nphase of this daily routine of ex\nistence. It was only Sunday, December\nthe twentieth that our well\nknown citizen Hon. John T. Sen\nter gave up his duties on earth\nand passed to the world eternal.\nMr. Senter leaves to grieve\nand lament their loss a devoted\nwife, six children and a host of\nfaithful friends and ardent ad\nmirers. To them the transactions\nof cruel fate are incomprehensi\nble, and the whys and where\nfores oi this old life are inexplici\nble, but we must accept in way\nof decree that which is done\nthrough God\'s will and ever\ntrust in his omniscient grace and\nomnipotent power to provide that\nwhich is best adapted for our\nwelfare and in harmony with\nHis preordained will.\nMr. Senter no doubt had his\ncharacteristic faults, as we our\nselves. Still when we attempt\nto sum up the defects in others,\nlet us remember what our Christ\nsaid to the multitude on the\nMount when they insisted in\nstoning to deatn tne smiui wo-\nUmen. "Let him who is without\nn\nsin cast the first stone."\nMany admit and few deny that\nMr. Senter was endowed with\nan exceptionally brilliant intel-\njjlect; so, when we justly consider\nthe numerous hardships that Ihc\nwas compelled to endure and\novercame, such as the burning\nof his ofiice building some years\nago, which was absolutely void\nof a cent\'s insurance, let us then\nhesitate and ask ourselves the\nquestion. ...\nG.

Under the\nterms of the compromise that\nwas arranged between the anti\nprohibitionists and the Anti-Saloon\nLeague, every saloon in the\nstate closed its doors the last day\nof December. Since the passage\nof the new law there have been\nno renewals of licenses.\nThe only trouble the prohibi\ntionists have is to conquer the\n"blind tiger," and this will be\nno small undertaking. The anti-saloon\nforces assert that they\nare firmly entrenched and are\nprepared to assist in the effect\nive enforcement of the law.\nMississippi for some time has\nbeen in the list of the "near\nprohibition" states through the\noperation of the local option laws\nin the counties. In practically\nthe whole state the sale of liquor\nhas been restricted. The five\ncounties in which whiskey and\nbeer have until the 1st been\nlegally selling are now "dry."\nThe following appeared in The\nMeridian Star of Deccember 29:\n"Oear Santa Claus: Please\nbring me for Xmas $250,000\nworth of paving free.

"\nMutilated Stamps Now Worthless.\nUntil quite recently a postage\nstamp that was . half with the\nletter writer was good enough to\ntake the missive on through the\nmails, but such stamps are not\ngood any more.\nUnder an order recently passed\nby the Postoffice Department a\nstamp that is mutilated in the\nslightest degree is worthless, and\nthis is a fact that should be re\nmembered by everybody.\nBy the terms of the new order,\nif a corner be torn off, no matter\nhow small, or the stamp be mu\ntilated in any way, it can not be\nused. All letters bearing such\nstamps will be held at the post\noffice two weeks for recovery,\nand at the end of that time, if\nnot claimed, will be sent to the\ndead letter office.\nAnother phase of the order is\nalso interesting. Permission is\ngiven individuals to perforate\nthe stamp they use with a rea\nsonably small instrument for\nidentification purposes, Such a\nstep is intended to prevent the\nsending of anonymous letters or\nthe theft or mutilation of pri\nvate mail of any nature.

J. McCfcf. crtwy f th InUnJ Witcrwiyi CommiMlun.\nWO hundred trillion cubic feet of water on an average fall on\nthe surface of the United Stares every year. This to the\nminds of most people i? but a lot of figures a two with a\nstring of ciphers. To be more explicit, it equals about ten\nMississippi, and that volume of water is the ENTIRE BASIS OF\nOUR PROSPERITY.\nWith the ten Mississippi falling upon the land of the United\nStates every year two Missis-sippis run off. Thus one-fifth of the water\nfall from the heavens flows into the sea. Of the eight Mississippis re\nmaining about five are absorbed, passing off into the air to be precipi\ntated again and again. A fraction, in part, paes into the earth and\nslowly reaches the oceans, while another fraction h consumed, passing\ninto chemical combinations, such as plant growth, etc.\nf\nWhat we want to do is-to MINIMIZE THE WASTE OF WA\nTER AND MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS which must accrue to\nthe citizens and eountry hy proper CONSERVATION of water\nsupply.\nIF WE SO CONTROL THE WATER THAT THE RIVERS SHALL\nFLOW IN UNIFORM STAGE WE WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF\nINLAND NAVIGATION AND MAKE THE UNITED STATES RICHER\nBY A THOUSAND PER CENT THAN IT IS TODAY.\nIn order to do this we must equalize the run of the streams at the\nheads of the rivers, and this mav be done bv dams and reservoirs and\nscientific cultivation of the soil along the courses of both streams and\nrivers. The levees of the lower Mississippi have done a magnificent\nwork, but the PREVENTION OF FLOODS is better far than all\nthe levees in the world.\nWhat we want to do u to GET BACK TO NATURE in deal\ning with water first, to prevent flood?, and, second, to compel the\nwater to run clear and pure. It is a fact that each year the rivers of\nthe mainland of the UNITED STATES POUR INTO THE SEA\nA THOUSAND MILLIONS OF TONS OF RICHEST SOIL\nMATTER in the form of suspended sediment, an impost greater than,\nall our land taxes combined and a commensurate INJURY TO COM\nMERCE in the lower rivers, which are rendered capricious and diffi\ncult of control by this unstable load.\nTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE POWER VALUE ALONE BETWEEN\nCONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLED STREAMS WOULD IN TEN\nYEARS PAY THE ENTIRE COST OF STREAM CONTROL IN THE\nUNITED STATES.

It is from holding- such sales, and\ncareful buying, that has enabled us to keep our stock fresh and clean; free from all stickers and out of date styles. Cur stock on hand at this date is perhaps\none of the cleanest stocks in Mississippi; at least that\'s what the traveling men tell us and they know. But of course it is impossible to sell out each season\nevery yard of goods and every other article in the store. It matters not how carefully the goods are bought, how low they are priced nor how large the sales\nmay be, there is bound to be some goods that did not sell. Even though there be only a little left from each season, these little piles will amount to consider\nable if allowed to accumulate from year to year. It is to prevent such accumulation in this store that I have decided to hold every few years a sale to be\nknown as a "House Cleaning Sale." At these sales I propose to so reduce the price of every article in the house that it will be known as the greatest of bar\ngain events. Our first sale of this kind ,\nOSZOOINIS POD30Af, JUMlIFS\nand will continue ton days. Every piece of merchandise in the store, with the exception of thread and a few other small notions, will be reduced from lO to\n50 per cent. That means that you can buy some goods that we sell regular at $1.00, for 50 cents some will go at 75 cents, while some dollar qualities will\nbo sold at 90 cents, so on every purchase you make at the store during the sale you will save not less than 10 per cent, and in many instances as much as 50\nper cent. Where everything in the store is reduced, as in this sale, it would be impossible to quote the reduced price on every article, but we are going to\nmention enough from each department for you to realize that this will be the greatest money-saving sale we or any other house ever inaugurated. Head\ncarefully every item mentioned below don\'t skip a line or a word.\nDress Goods at and\nIJelow Cost\nWe believe ve have the cleanest,\nfreshest stock of Dress Goods of any\nliou-e in Mississippi; with the excep\ntion of about six or eight picceH, every\npiece now on hand was bought this eea\nftou anl is in the height of style euch\nf.ihriea as broadcloth, serges, diagnols,\n1\'ananw and shadow stripe effects, all\nof which will be fashionable for spring\nwear, hi t as we stated above, every\nthing in the tdore would be reduced for\nt\'ni.j sale, so nothing will be reserved\nwe know and are positive that at the\nprices we offer these dress goods they\nare the be-,t values ever put before the\nwomen of Columbus.
