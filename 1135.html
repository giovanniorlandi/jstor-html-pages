Concerning the im\nportance of this meeting, it should not be necessary to comment.\nThe only reason why we refer to it, is to call particular attention to\nIhe fact that it is called fur 7 o\'clock.\nThe man or woman who is late in meeting an \'engagement, f.o\ncial or business, is stealing somebody else\'s time. That\'s u blunt\nway to express it but it: is the plain truth. When you faif to arrive\nfit a meeting at, the hour designated, you are taking other people\'s\n1hnr. Jt is bad manners besides being morally wrong.\nBeing on time is largely a matter of habit. There is seldom\nany-valid excuse for being late. The "Retter Cities Contest" ami\nevery other public, movement will make more progress if members\nof committees will resolve 1o meet all engagements promptly. Jt is\nthe decent and thoughtful thing to do. Jt can he done if you will\nplan it that way. For heavens\' sake, don\'t keep a lot of busy peo\nple waiting and then come in with some flinisv excuse for being\nJate.\nThe Cotton Planter\'s Way Out\nAVith the price of the staple far below the cost of production,\nthe plight of the cotton planter is nothing short, of tragical. It is a\ndesperate situation indeed, and the man who is unable to hold\nhis product for the better price which is hoped. for has no choice\nbut to take loss. The only mitigating feature of the disaster is the\nfact that it. is driving farmers into adopting measures to prevent\nthe recurrence of such a calamity in the future. From Alabama\nconies the news that farmers are organizing "Nine to One Clubs"\nii:e members of which pledge themselves to plant nine acres of land\nto food and feed crops to one of cotton.\nAccording to E. E. Miller,, editor of the Southern "Agriculturist,\nthe salvation of the cotton country depends upon diversification of\ncrops and the adoption of a system of co-nperatn e marketing. In\nthe Review of Reviews, Mr. Miller writes as follows:\nThe first thing farmers must do is to put their farming\non a sounder basis. No legislation that may be enacted,\nno organization they may be able to affect, will make them\nable to base the selling price of col ton upon the cost of\nproduction until they own the crop when it is made. A\ncol ton crop mortgaged to pay for the living of its grower\nwhile he was producing it belongs not to the grower, but, J\nto the man who supplied him. Jt, must, be sold when the j\nsupply man calls for his money. The Noiirli had made greaf\nprogress in recent years away from the all-cotton methods j\nof the old days; but cotton still takes up too large a pro- j\nportion of the cultivated land, and is still too largely.de- I\npended upon to supply a living for its producers. The j\nwork of educating not only the actual growVrs of cotton,\nbut also the large land-owners, the merchants and the\nbankers of the cotton country, to the benefits of rational\nsystem of divirsified farming must be continued. Cnlil\nthe South raises its own living, speaking at large, and\nmakes cotton really a money, or surplus, crop, it cannot\nhope to market its cotton in orderly fashion.\nEvery increase in the acreage planted to food and\nfeed crops in the cotton country, every development of a\nmore staple and profitable livestock industry, adds to\nthe cotton growers\' ability both to produce cotton at a\nreasonable cost and to finance the .crop after it is pro\nduced. , The present acreage yield of cotton is shamefully\nlow which means, of course, that the cost of .produc\ntion is much higher than it, need be. The growing of\ncotton in a regular rotation with the grains and the\nsoil-building legumes could bring the average acre produc--tion\nup to a half-bale or more in five years\' time. Many\n\'..farmers have already greatly increased Ihe productive\n; .capacity of their cotton lands by such means, and the\nfarmers who have hacked their cotton-growing by the\njudicious raising of livestock as so many Georgia, farmers\nhave done with hogs, for example, or as so many Mississ\nippi farmers are doing with cattle are the farmers who will\nsuffer least from this year\'s depression of cotton prices.\nThe best security an individual or a section can have\nagainst going "broke" on any particular crop is a diver\nsification of crops.\nOnce the farmers really own the cotton crop, coopera\ntive marketing associations, utilizing the National "Ware\nhouse Act, will be in position to let Ihe crop out as the\nmarket demands it, instead of dumping nearly all of it,\nas now, upon the market as soon us ginned. They will also\nbe in position to sell directly to the mills or to ex\nporters. The National Warehouse Act is a very simple measure,\nbut it provides the means by which the cotton-grower\ncan hold his cotton and borrow money on it instead of\nrushing it to market when the price is unduly low. Briefly\nthis act privides for the establishment, under govern\nment supervision, of warehouses of approved type. The\nmanagers id\' these warehouses must be bonded ami the\nbuildings and their contents fully protected by insurance\nIn one of them the grower mny store his cottoii. each bale\nbeing weighed ami graded as it is taken in, ami having\na transferable warehouse receipt issued against it. This re\nceipt js l.y its very nature collateral of high class, ami\nthe Federal Reserve system makes it possible for the\nbank loaning money on it to rediscount it, thus giving it\nn fixed standing in any money market. Already these\nwarehouse receipts have won general acceptance as a basis\nfor credit; but the number of bonded warehouses is yet so\nsmall that no appreciable part of the crop can be stored\nin this way.\nA sanely diversified farming system, the building of\napproved warehouses, the organization of cooperative mar\nketing associations these combine to make for the cotton\nfarmer a plain ami safe road out from his present troubles\nto financial independence and a stabilized pri"e for his great\nsale crop.\n, There is so much hud\nof us,\nAnd so much good In the worst Of us,\nThat it hardly behooves any of us\n; To talk about the rest of. us.\nAnon.\nI With the return of the winter\ni season, we ure again wondering why\ni it is that, whether we push or pull,\nthe postoffice doors always open the\ni other way.\nj\nj Of course, nobody but Uurleson is\nto blame, for it.

Thus is literary fame won by\nproxy.\nDoubtless Mr. Ford spills some of\nhis ideas into the ears of his writers\nbefore they turn out his page and\nthat\'s the worst tiling about.

GROAT\n(United Press Staff Correspondent).\nBerlin. (By Mall). "Germany must\nregulate and adjust its currency and\nfinancial situutlon " if it is to avoid\nconditions worse than Russia."\nThe statement of Hugo Stinnes,\ncoal and Iron king, is one of his ar\nguments in his fight against social\nization of the German coal mines.\nSt\'nnes takes the position that, with\nGermany\'s finances in a muddled, al\nmost bankrupt condition, socializa\ntion Is an impossibility. Ii the finan\ncial structure topples, according to\n. his theory, Germany is ruined for\never. The entente can ste.p in and\ntake what it wants. And, socializa\ntion of the mines will not alter tlin\ngeneral financial situation except\nperhaps to make it worse.\nHe contends, further, that the two\nschemes proposed total socializa\ntion or partial socialization with\nboth capital and labor represented\nwill make for higher expenses and\nlower production.\nSingling out tha coal mines for\nsocialization i.-i, according to the\nmining king, an impossible proposi\ntion. The wlulo national economy\nmust be cleaned up and imiproved,\nand this singling out -process would\nonly mean a further wrench of the\nentire structure, he contends.\n"The present national investigation\nInto the moans of socialization of the\nmines,\'; Stinnes toltf a group of in\ndustrial chieftains, "must take our\nwhole economical situation into con\nsideration. "If we are unabto to regulate our\ncurrency, wo will be unable to buy\nany hil j gr.ln.
