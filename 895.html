The\nmeeting was the\nresult of certain correspondence\nbetween the Hoard of Trade and\nthe Land Office, wherein Com\nmissioner l\'ratt agreed to meet the\nHoard of Trade upon his arrival in\nHilo. The matter was first brought\nto the attention of the Hoard cf\nTrade by a letter from one of its\nmembers, whereupon a Committee\nof Investigation was appointed,\nwhich made a thorough investiga\ntion of the matter. Tin letter of\ncomplaint follows:\nHilo, Hawaii, June Sth, 1904.\nTo the President mid Members of the\nHoard of Trade of Hilo,\nHiloHawaii.\nGknti.kmkn: Through fear, or some\nother unexplained reason, theic seems to\nbe no one who dare criticise the actions\nof certain Government officials in their\ndisposal 01 uovcrumetit lands, it is a\nwell known fact that exchanges are being\nmade whereby Honolulu gets a proposed\nproposed\nIts most\nstreet and, llilo.loses blocks ol\nvaluable property.\nThe exchange of the entire block be\ntween Hnckfehl & Cos\', store and the\nLycurgus properly, 011 Waiauiicnue\nStreet, to n -Mrs. Ward for a proposed\nstreet in Honolulu; nud the trade with\nHenry Hapai and Miss Conn for the pro\nposed" extention of Uridge Strict, is, even\nnow, know to a very few. lint 110 one,\nexcept those directly interested, knew of\nthe deals until months alter they were\nconsummated. The trade with Hapai, so\nI mil informed, was made over strenuous\nobjections from Mr. Richards, to whom\nthe proposition had been submitted.\nAnother quiet deal has come to light:\nHonolulu has one more proposed street\nand T. Clive Davies has a deed to n 40\nacre tract of laud on which issituatedthe\nWaiakea Mill, including a portion of the\nWuiakca pond mid one of tile best springs\non the Island. To dispose of a pond or\nspring is strictly forbidden in Section 176 I\nof the Civil Laws," if they nre or may be I\nof public use. And all such sales are ah- I\nsolutely null and void."\nThe lust known transaction was con\nstimulated a few weeks ago by otu local\nland agent, under instructions from the\nmain office, in which Mr. Kugcuc II. Ly\nman was granted a Right of Purchase\nLease of 97 acres of laud, almost within\nin..

Kinney\ny and has been !\napplied for by several persons who were\nwilling to pay prices ranging from $20.\nto JF50. per acre, and if sold at auction, I\nbelieve, would have brought more thnu\n$50. per acre. All applicants, except\nMr. Lyman, (or these lots weie met\nwith the remark: "You cannot get those\nlots for they have been withdrawn from\nsettlement." And, upon inquiry, I find\nthey were withdrawn and it\'isso stnled in\nthe office books.\nThis would have been an excellent\ntract to have divided into residence lots\nami would have furnished splendid\nopportunities to many families who de\nsire suburban homes. I am informed\nthat n proposition wns made for a settle\nment association but was turned down he\n.. .W, ........,...,..-... ....

It is true that Mime of Mr. Kiuuev\'s\nland is belter than the lots transferred to\nMr. Lyman but the greater part Is thc\nsame. ,\nSection 56 of the Laud Act sets forth\n"that land shall he appraised by the Sub-1\nAir,nl mill Miintlier m.rkfit, nml t,,,!!

If these\nlots had been withdrawn, was it not your\nduty to have had llieni re-nrtvertiscil and\nthus acquaint the public that they had\nagain been opened for settlement? We\ndo not,lor one moment suppose that any\nwrong was intended, but the results are\nthe ssjiie as if wrong had been intended.\nOn September 23rd, 1899, Mr. Walter\nI? Wall, surveyor in charge of the Gov\ncriimujit Survey Departiucut, wrote Hon.\nJns. A,\' King, Minister of Interior and\namong other things said, "Mr. llaldwin\nvnluesdol No. 4 nt $50.00 peracre." And\nntjthcjpme Mr. Lyman made his applica\nlion there were men in Hilo who were\nready to give $20.00 per acre for the en\ntire two lots, nml there nre several men\nwho stand ready today togive from f 35.00\nto &Jjtt per acre for one of the lots.\nNi\'w it tceilis to lis that Mr. Williams\ndid wrong in ever ngreeing to the very\nlow appraisement of 53.00 per acre, as in\nall his letters to you he seems to have\ndwelt upon the fact that these lots "Were\nonly two and one half miles froth Hilo."\nWe presume Mr. Williams desired to con\nvey to you the fact that thev would bring\nthe Government much more money if\ndivided up uuil sold for residence lots and\nwe think he should have W) advised you.\nAnd had he not finally compromised\nwith the Land Appraiser there would\nhave been no appraisement, then you\nwould hne been made acquainted with\nthe great disparity between Mr. Williams\'\nand the other appraisers value 01 the land\nami no sale would have been made.\nThis land has a frontage on the Gov\nernment Kallmann Road and is ininm\ndiately adjacent to Mr. Win.

I.y\nman claimed to have applied for\nthe lots in question seven years\nago, and requesting that a search\nbe made of the Hilo files to see if\nthere was any evidence of such an\napplication,\nthe Honolulu files !\n" " C " nW,,,Cn,to"- Mr\'\nWilliams replied that there was no\n1 r i , ,, ...\n"" mich application, although\nMr. Baldwin stated to him that it I\n"had been sent to Honolulu at the\ntime it was made. Hnhlwiii nlun\ninformed Williams that the said lots\ni,n,i been withdrawn. On March\nlgth t wrote t0 Williams telling him\n. l0 lnke ifVmnn..s n,)pncnt!ou nnew\nI for ln(. h.li(i lotS( aju, 0 March lfjh\nthe application was sent down.\nMr. Williams reported that the ap\npraisement stood nt $1 per acre and\nsuggested that it be reappraised,\nwhich I subsequently ordered him\nto do, and the appraisement wns\nsent down as $3 per acre, Mr. Wil\nliams and Mr. Supe acting as ap\npraisers. The lease was thereafter\nduly issued to Mr. Lyman. The\nmatter was carried on in the regular\norder of affairs. Mr. l\'ratt stated\nthat there was no record of the lots\nhaving been withdrawn, and that\ninasmuch ns they had already been\nadvertised there was no reason why\nthey should have been re-advertised.\nAll requirements of the\nLand Act had been complied with.\nHe also stated that there were no\nrecords of any recent applications\nfor the said lots, the objection be\ning made at the time of the applica\ntion of J. R. Wilson and Chas. Akau\nthat there was no road to the place.\nLand Agent Williams and Mr.\nA. U. Loebenstein were examined\nas to the location of the Kaumana\nroad relative to the two lots, and\nstated that the lots did not have a\nfrontage on the road. Sheriff An\ndrews was examined and stated\nthnt the road was about 200 feet off\nthe lots, but that the Govern\nment owned the strip between the\nroad and the, lots, the same having\nbeen transferred for the very pur\npose of giving the said lots a front\nage. The Committee then pre\nsented Right of Purchase Lease\nNo. 10 of transfer from W. A. Ray\nto W. Kinney, with the following\nendorsement:\n"That he will release to the Commis\nsioner of Public Lauds from Ponnhawai\nLot 3 a strip of land fronting 200 .feet\nwide 011 the new Kaumana road and ex\ntending the same width, 300 feet, back to\nL0L4; also release from Lot 6, n strip\nfronting 200 feet wide on the new Knu-\nnmuaroad nud exteuijiiig the Mine width,.\n200 fecCb.ick to Lot 5,\'\'\n(Signed) J.

The Committee also\nsubmitted a letter from Walter K.\nWall, Surveyor to Minister of In\nterior J. A. King, dated Sept. 23,\n1809, which stated that said lots\nwere worth $50 per acre.\nBefore retiring from the meeting\nMr. Pratt stated that he felt that a\ngreat injustice had been done the\npublic in the matter of the granting\nof this Lease and the low assessment\nthereof. He said that he would\nsubmit the matter to the Attorney\nGeneral and if the lease could be\nbroken, it would be done. He\nsaid in future he would direct his\nsub-agents to notify the newspapers\nof any pending applications for\nGovernment land, so that there\nmight be an opportunity for the\npublic to protest if every thing\nwasn\'t satisfactory. He said that\nevery record in the Land Office was\npublic property and he desired the\npublic to know all that was going\non.\nMr. Pratt further slated that if\nthe Hoard of Trade would recom\nmend a suitable person, who could\nget the Party endorsement, as\nappraiser for the two districts, he\nwould commission him.\nConstantinople, July 10.

Vice-Captain Arimori at once\nordered his men to repair the\nhole and try to prevent leakage.\nThis work was soon completed, and\nthe fact was quickly reported to\nCaptain Nakao and Rear-Admiral\nNashiwn. The IIntsu.se was im\nmediately taken in tow by a war\nvessel. Owing to the rough seas\nprevailing at the time, the ship was\nalmost unmanageable, ami the tow\nropes finally snapped. The captain\nand the Vice-Captain went below\nwith the object of ascertaining the\nexact nature of the damage. While\nthey were engaged in this task at\n12:30 p. 111., the battleship touched\na second mechanical mine on her\nport-side, The Vice-Captain wns\nkilled outright. The noise of the\nexplosion wns deafening in the ex\ntreme. Dense volumes of black\nsmoke rose high in the air, aud\nflames raged furiously. The scene\nthat followed was indcctibable.\nIn another minute and ten seconds\nthe big battleship went to the bot\ntom. One hour and forty minutes\nhad elapsed since she touched the\nfirst mine and the time she .sank.\nSeveral Japanese war-vessels which\nwere ii the vicinity at the time\nof the disaster quickly went to the\nassistance of t,he crew and suc\nceeded in rescuing over three hun\ndred men. Rear- Admiral Nnshiwn\nwns rescued nnd tnken 011 the war\nship Tatsuda. The Captain and\nall the members of the crew worked\nwell when the ship was going\ndown- Sub-Lieutenant Innaka\ndid -especially good service. On\nlearning the disastrous fate of the\nvessel he rushed- into the room\nwhere the photographs of their\nmajesties were kept and removed\nthem nlong with the important\ndocuments aboard, to\' safer places.\nHe was afterwards working just\nabove the powder magazine when\nthe mine which sunk the ship ex\nploded and killed him. When the\nHatsuse met with disaster, sixteen\nRussian torpedo-destroyers rushed\nout of the harbor and went towards\nthe Japanese war-vessels. Their\nobject was probably to impede the\nsalvage work and to attack . the\nJapanese war-vessels by taking\nadvantage of the opportunity. The\nTntsuta on seeing the approach of\nthe enemy\'s craft turned around\nand dashed lor them. The latter\nretreated towards the harbor mouth.\nThe Tatsuta tried to pursue\nthem at high speedut ns it wns\nfenred thnt she might be exposed\nto cross fire from the enemy\'s\nbatteries nnd nlso to the danger of\nmechanical mines, Renr-Adrairal\nNnshiwn ordered her to give up the\nattempt.

Mc-\nCormick and his wife have any\nthing but a pleasant time of it in\nthat city, hnving been completely\nostracized by Russian society.\nThe reason for this is easily under\nstood when it it remembered that\neverybody in Russia is under the\nimpression that the sympathies of\nthe United States are with Japan in\nthe present war.\nFor weeks the official residence,\nof. the Ambassador in St. Peters\nburg has been deserted by every\none but the members of the lega\ntion and an occasional messenger \'\nfrom the Czar, who does not want\nto offend the minister of a power-\nfi,1 tmtlnn lint it1lncn nfTnttc In ttl. \'\n.. .....iv..., .\'... . ..v-.tw .awa ... iw aaa\n(luce Russian niistocrnts and society\npeople to re-establish friendly terms\nwith Mr. McCormick hnve been\nwithout result.\nAmong Americans, therefore, it\nis well known that Mr. McCormick\nand his wife are heartily tired of\nthe Russian metropolis. It is even\nsaid that Mr. McCormick has ap\nplied to President Roosevelt, asking\nto be relieved from his post, ns his\nwife is suffering keenly under the\nslights of all members of Russian\nsociety, as well as by members of\nthe Legation of France.\nThe impression here is however,\nthat the Czar would like to have\nMr. McCormick remain in St.\nPetersburg rather than have a new\nman subjected to the same humilia\ntions before he had time to make\nfriends with everybody.\nPersonally the American Minister\nis quite popular, and his entertain\nments before the war were a great\nsuccess, showing that his present\nisolated position is only a result of\nRussian patriotism aud not of any\nill will toward him personally.\nWcntlirr It 11 r run.\nMr. Ashley, who recently arrived\nfrom the mainland to establish a\nlocal station of the Federal weather\nbureau has started in on the import\nant work he has before him.

It didn\'t amount\nto anything, but it mmelike n cool\ning lireee ncross tbc dead and\ndread desert of tlic programme.\nAn effort was made to net common\njustice for Hawaii. Of course it\nfailed. Tbe poor Hnwaiians came\n5,000 miles to see tbe show, and\nthe show, as such, is bunko. The\nRepublican National Committee\nhad told them they were to have\nsix delegates, and six made the\nlong journey. Then they found\nthat but five seats had been allotted\nto them. One seat had been stolen\ndeliberately because some unexpect\ned and unallotted delegates had\ncome from l\'oito Rico and the\n1\nPhilippines, and it was nccavtnry\nto make places for them.\nHut the Committee on Rules\nmet and rubbed a rebuff into the\nHawaiians. It allowed them only\ntwo otes instead of six. All other\nTerritories were given six votes.\nAlaska, not a Territory, but a Fed\neral district, had been allowed four\nvotes by the National Committee,\nbut the Committee on Rules in\ncreased the allowance to six.\nCould anything be more unjust?\nRvery child knows that Hawaii\nhas more population than Alaski.\nIt has more than the State of Neva\nda, by a long way. Rut the Com\nmittee on Kules Headed iy a queer ,\nold "party" named General Henry\nII. Bingham of Pennsylvania, cut\noff the Hawaiians and increased the\nAlaskans.\nSenatoi J. K. Foraker of Ohio\nled the fight to give the Hawaiians\ntheir plain rights. Senator Foraker\noffered the following amendment:\n"Resolved, That the report of\nthe committee on rules be amended\nso as to allow six delegates from\nHawaii with six votes in conformity\nwith her sister territories of Arizona,\nNew Mexico, Oklahoma, Indian\nTerritory and Alaska." He got a\nhearing for Governor Carter of\nHawaii, who made an impassioned\nplea for the amendment.\n"Gentlemen of the convention of\nthe Republican party," he said,\n"there seems to be an impression\non the part of some that Hawaii is\nnot a Territory. I wish to call their\nattention to the fact that Hawaii is\non the map of the United States\nand is now one of its possessions.\nGod grant the occasion may not\narise, but if war comes in the\nPacific, the Sandwich Islands will\nbe necessary to the American people\nand Hawaii will not be found want\ning." Senator Hopkins of Illinois led\nthe opposition. There wasn\'t a\nshred of reasoning why Hawaii\nshouldn\'t have the votes, but tlu\nprogrammers had some sort of idea\nthat they wanted to cut down the\nisland representation.\nThe West, with the exception of\nNevada voted with Hawaii.\nThe little Sagebrush State that,\non population hasn\'t a third of\nHawaii\'s right to six votes, cast\nher six solidly against the islands.\nThese six lost Hawaii her right\nand the Nevadans had traveled\nacross the country with the Hawaii\nans. It was what we call in the\nWest a "stinking trick" and the\nonly way I can account for it is the\nfact that Colonel H. K. Maxson an\naffable sort of windbag from Ne\nvada, was the Secretary of the\nCommittee on Rules.\nThe territories voted "No" with\nthe exception of Oklahoma, which\ncast two ayes and and Hawaii,\nwhich declined to vote at all. The\nvote resulted, 497 ayes, 490 noes.\nThe result was to allow the i.six\nHawaii delegates two votes.\nA war writer for one of the Lon\ndon papers says facetiously:\n"Your correspondent secured the\nlatest issue of the Port Arthur\nDaily Novi Krai, which bears at its\nhead the following notice: \'No\npaper is issued on days when the\nJaps open fire upon the fortress,\nfor the Chinese working our hand\npresses regularly decamp -at the\nfirst shot. There is no way of re\nstraining thc-e heathen, who even\ndisiegi\'rd the orders of the viceroy\nand commandant. \' "\nMiiriim Testlitiuii).\nNew Yoik, June 21. Kvidclirc\nof n startling nature, which doubt-\nless will have a most important\nbearing on the ultimate result of\nthe Coroner\'s inquiry into the\nGeneral Slocum disaster, was forth\ncoming at the inquest today.\nPerhaps the most unexpected in\ncident was the refusal to answer\nquestions on the part of II. LuihI\nberg, a United States steamboat in\nspector, who was supposed to have\ninspected the life preservers and the\nhull of the Slocum. His refusal\nwas based on the ground that an\nanswer might tend to incriminate\nhim and he acted on the advice of\nhis counsel.\nTh. Coroner committed Lund\nberg to the House of Detention,\nbut later accepted $500 bail for his\nappearanceat the hearing tomorrow,\nwhich was satisfactory to the\nAssistant District Attorney.\nSecond Pilot Weaver of the Slo\ncum testified that he had purchased\nthe fire hose for that boat and Gar\nvan introduced evidence to show\nthat the price paid was 40 cents a l\nfoot, less 6 per cent., or 16 cents a\nfoot net.\n"Don\'t you know that you can\'t\nbuy good fire hose for less than a\ndollar or a dollor and a half a foot?"\n"I. don\'t know anything about\nthe price of hose," responded\nWeaver.\nWeaver also declared that there\nhad been no fire drill on the Slo\ncum this year. ,\nDaniel O\'Neill, who, according\nto his sworn statement, had never\nworked on a boat until he was hired\non the Slocum a short time ago, ad\nmitted that he had jumped into a\nrowboat filled with people from the\nSlocum, capsizing it. Asked if he\nsaved any one, he .said others were\ndoing that and he was not an ex\nprt swimmer. He swam ashore\nhimself, however. O\'Neill de\nclared he never saw a fire drill on\nthe boat.\nReferring to the efforts to throw\nwater on the fire when it was first\ndiscovered, O\'Neill told of the\nbursting of the hose. He ran and\ngo the rubber washing hose, but\nthe coupling would not fit the sand\npipe. This was some of the sen\nsational testimony brought out.\nLnrlluc in South he.is.\nThe yacht Lurline is due to\narrive at Hilo about August 15,\nhaving completed her voyage in\nthe South Seas, which included\nTahiti, Samoa, Marqueses and\nGuam. The last news received\nfrom the Lurline was from Pago\nPago, Samoa. She was in port\nabout two weeks awaiting the\narrival of Captain Sinclair\'s son\nArthur, who joined his parents\nthere.\nAbout the 15th of June the Lur\nline people were to sail for Fiji\nwhere they expected to enjoy a\ntwo-week\'s stay cruising among\nthe islands of that group. From\nFiji the Lurline goes to Guam and\nthen back to Hawaii. This is\nabout a month ahead of her sche\ndule, aild it is possible she will\nvisit Kauai and Oahu before leaving\nfor San Pedro, the Lurliuc\'s home\nport.\nWhat Our Territory Cost.\nThe cost of the acquisition of\nvarious territory by the United\nStates is given in the following list:\nLouisiana, $1,000,000; Florida,,\n000,000; Texas, $1,500,000; Cal\nifornia and New Mexico $15,000,\n000; Arizona, $10,000,000; Alaska,\n$7,250,000; Philippine islands, $20,\n000,000; Panama canal, $40,000,000\nPanama canal strip, $10,000,000;\ntotal, $140,750,000. In addition\nthe United States when it annexed\nHawaii assumed a debt of $4,000,\n000,\nForeign.\nBurnos Ayres, Argentine\nHe-1\npublic, June 29,-A battle has been\niuuui in 1 upumuai. in wmi\'ii nil;\nUruguay Government forces lost\n000 killed and 800 wounded. The\nrebels are said to have lost only 100\nkilled and 000 wounded.\nGuayaquil, Kcuador, June 27.\nSerious riots have been caused by\na raising of the water rates in this\ncity, A mob of 5000 attacked the\npolice.\nI\'nrkrr lliiucli PIkIiI.\nThe chief points in dispute seem)\nto be: Colonel Samuel Parkermaiu-\ntains, that he is surviving partner\nof the partnership between himself\n\'and John P. Parker, who by his1\nwill direcled that the pattucrship\nshould be continued by his heir,\nJohn P. Parker the younger, who ,\ndied under age, but leaving n (\ndaughter who according, to the (\nsame will should take his place I\nAs such surviving partner Col\nonel Parker clnitns, that he has\nsole control of the business, and,\ntherefore, the right to remove Mr.\nA. W- Carter from I lie management\nof it.\nOn the other hand, Mr. A. W.\nCarter says, that, as the guardian\nand trustee of the heir of John P.\nParker, he has equal puthorily\nwith Colonel Samuel Parker; and\nbesides this, that Colonel Parker,\nwhen he made Mr. A. W. Catter\nmanager of the Parker Ranch,\ndivested liimsell ol all turtlicr con\ntrol of the place or business and\ngave whatever authority he had lo\nMr. A. W. Carter, without reserv\ning the right to resume or take\nnwnv from Mr. Carter the authoriij\nhe gave him.\nColonel Parker denies this claim\nof Mr. A. W. Carter, and alleges,\nthat he has not, according to law,\nthe power to depute his nuthority\nas surviving partner to Mr. A. W.\nCarter or anyone else; and that he\nnever attempted as Mr. Carter\nclnitns he did to depute his\nauthority to Mr. Carter. He then\ncharges Mr. Carter with misman\naging the business and expending\nlarge sums of money uselessly and\nextravagantly and contrary to jthe\ninterests Df both his ward and Col\nonel Parker.\nIn this way, by charge and coun\nter accusation, the quarrel develops,\nand, as the property is large and\nthe history of the affair a lengthy\none, the details are so numerous\nthat the litigation is already taking\nmost of the time of two of our courts\nand nearly a score of our leading\ncounsel.\nTobacco.\nIt has been shown in the Hama\nkua experiment that tare and skill\nwill produce good tobacco in these\nislands. It has been disputed only\nby those who raise tobacco as they\ndo forage grass and mourn to find\nit rank.\nOne of the drawbacks to small\nfarming in this country is the idea\nthat one "may tickle the soil with\na hoe and have it laugh a harvest."\nWhen the soil does not laugh then\nthe man with a hoe begins to mope\nand say things about the bad out\nlook for agriculture. The con\ndition precedent to good farming\nhere or wherever fine crops are de\nsired is some knowledge of soils\nand plenty of "care and skill."\nThe building up of the sugar in\ndustry emphasizes that. There\nwere enough of carping critics of\nsugar here in the early days. A\nfew haphazard efforts to grow cane,\nresulting in positive failures, gave\npoint to the jeer that nothing could\ngrown on the islands but what the\nnatives raised on their kuleanas,\ntaro and sweet potatoes being the\nstaples. But men who brought\nbrains and science to the task made\npossible a sugar crop worth $25,\n000,000.\nSuch men are experimenting\nwith tobacco and doing well\nThey are here to teach others how\nand where to grow the crop and il\nenterprising landholders know\nwhat is good for themselves and\nthe Territory, they will take hold\nand give tobacco a fair trial.\nThere is no visible reason why the\nweed of solace should not become\n, of as much advantage to our export\ntrade as it is, relatively speaking,\nto that of Cuba and the Philippines\n1 ii c :i J TT\nnere are luuuua aim iiavan;\ncigars tn market all over the world.\nWhy not Honolulu cigars?\nClIAMnRKI.AIN\'K CollP.
