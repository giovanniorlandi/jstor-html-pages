Weather\nspoon who has acted as one of the\nJudges for Hie past three yeara. In\nan Interview with the Argua, Mr.\nWeatberspoon saya:\n"The i \'i fair has proven to be\nthe greateat In the history of tho\ncounty as can well be testltled to by\nany and all who have been connected\nwith the work. The educational\nfeatures of a county fair must begin\nto bear \'good fruits\' aa ia evidenced\nby the classy selection of all farm\nproducts this year, as compared with\nother ears. In this respect the ex\nhibits as a whole run at least 50 per\ncent higher in class, than in former\nyeara, which goes to show that fur- I\niners and fruit growers have learned ;\nhow to select good stuff, and know\nit when they see It.\n"In eery line of agriculture, ex\ncept potatoes and corn, the exhibits\nwere far ahoc the general average\nof former years ami the fall down\nin potatoes is due to the diseased con\ndition of Hie entiru potato family In\nMalheur county, rather than to care\nlessness. The slight tall down in\nemu ia due evidently to carelessness\nin selection, rather than any other\ni.utse. since there is a larger acreage\nto -.elect from than ever before, and\n(he iiuulity Is good A little more\ncue in selection should have been\npracticed\n"From a horticultural point I do\nnot believe a better exhibit has ever\nbeen placed on exhibition at a conn\nty fair ill the state. Competition\nthat It was a hard matter to decide\nwho deserved the blue ribbon.\n"Aa a whole. If the entire building\nfull of exhibits could have been pick\ned up and let down In some of the\neastern states Just as It was here,\nMalheur county would have to Import\nmore real estate men in order to tuke\ncare of the Incoming homoseukers\nwho would follow.\n"It may be said that this county\nhas the \'nerviest\' bunch of boosters\nto be found lu Oregon. In view of\nthe fact that former years has seen\nbad weather, and luck of attendance\naccordingly, it seems that every one\nnow comes up with a smile, and this\nyear has pullod off the blggeat stunt\never.\n"The arrangement and decorations\nin the agricultural buildiugs deservo\ngreat credit, due, I think, to a keen\nforesight of Supt lUuloy and his\nassociates, who appear not to liawi\nleft a single detail undone\n"From a county fair standpoint,\nas 1 see It, and I seo ull Kasteru Ore\ngoti fairs, Malheur county pulls off\nthe best of all"\nAUCTION SALE\nAT CALDWELL\nThe first annual auction sule of\nthe "l\'ure llred Livestock llreedors\' ,\nAssociation," which was formed here\nduring the fair, will be held at (\'aid- \'\nwell, October 27 and 28, nil.\'.
