The senate\ncommittee on the Philippines resumed\nthe examination of witnesses in con\nnection with the investigation of af\nfairs in the Philippine islands.\nGrover Flint, of Cambridge, Mas.,\nwho reived as flist lieutenant in the\nThirty-first volunteer infantry, testi\nlied that early in May, 1900, he had\nbeen a witness to the water cure as\nadministered to the natives by the\nMaccabebe scouts, and that it was\ndone so as to gef information as to the\nwhereaboutB of their guns The guns\nwere delivered The following day\nsome men of bis own regiment applied\nthe cure, but their act was without the\nauthority of their commanding off!\ncers The Maccabebes at the time re\nfnrred to were not under commission\nof a commanding officer, but under a\nsergeant of the United States army.\nFlint had been, he said, a witness te\nat least twenty causes of water cure,\nlie never had seen any one die as a\nresult of the cure, but had seen a hos\npital corps man working on a native\nwho had been rendered unconscious.\nIt also had been reported to him that\none Filipino died from the effects of\nthe water cure.\nThe witness then described the\nmethod of administering the cure and\nsaid that in some cases where it was\ngiven to old men he had seen their\nteeth fall out.\nMr. Flint, in response to a question\nby Senator Dietrich, said he was pres\nent upon these occasions, "to draw the\nline on excesses." He did not recom\nmend to his major that the practice\nccaBe, nor did be give any orders to\nhie men to stop the torture.\nAnswering a question by Senator\nHarrows, the witness declared that\nthe effect of the cure was immediate,\nthe victim invariably turning in his\ngun or a bolo, and giving information\nas to the whereabouts of others. He\nsaid it was impossible to judge wheth\ner the victims were insurgent soldius\nor villagers.\nSome of them were thrown down by\nforce, others who were timid, would\nsubmit readily, while those who re\nsisted were simply held the more\ntightly. The treatment, he said, nev\ner got to the point of great brutality.\nReplying to a question by Senator\nLodge, the witness said he had been\nrefused a commission in the regular\ncanny because his colonel had report\ned him as using intoxicating liquors to\nexcess. The witness deplored the rais\ning of this question, but Senator Bev-\noridge said it had an important bear\ning on the case. Flint denied that on\nany of the occasions when he had wit\nnessed the water cure, was he under\nthe influence of liquor.\nAfter considerable question, he fin\nally admitted that he approved of the\nwater cure, and responding to a query\nby Senator Beveridge, said that it was\nnot an American invention, but was as\nold as the "Chronicles of Newgate."\nThe witness described the burning\nof small villages, the idea being, he\nnaid, to drive the people to the woods\nor to the towns and concentrate them.\n"Who did the army borrow that\nfrom?" inquired Senator Culberson.\n"I saw it in Cuba," answered the\nwitness, "under the authority of Gen-e-l\nWeyler."\nThe witness was then excused and\nthe committee went into executive\nsession.\nTo Control Coal Output.\nFairmont, W.

The resolution is as follows:\n"Whereae, the beef trust has, bv its\nunit wail manipulation, so increased the\nprice of meats that they have become a\nluxury to the workingman : therefore\nbe it\n"Resolved, That the Chicago Federa\ntion of Labor call upon the authorities\nof the nation and State to interpose the\nstrong arm of the law to protect this\ncountry from the robbery practiced upon\nit by this most greedy and ruthless trust.\'\'\nStrong speeches were made urging the\nunionists to stop the use of meat and\nresort to a vegetarian diet as a means of\ncombating the trust. These found many\nwilling listeners and did much to secure\nthe passage of the resolutions.\nNo one, whether a laboring man or\nnot, who voted for the Republican ticket\nat the last national election can con\nsistently kick against the work ot the\nmeat trust or any other trust.

March 7th.\nMy briar-root and I are in a mood to night,\nand as we sit aud muse oa the banks of a stream\nwhich rushes through the dales of memory with\nthe roar of a rain fed ford, we are minded of an\nobligation cancelled by almost every soldier\nwho has wandered from the old Commonwealth.\nKver siuce we crossed that spot where the East\ndoth meet the West, we have promised our\nselves, time after time, to liquidate, but "the\nsails have flapped idly against the mast of our\nintent," aud the present communication Is writ\nten with the time worn apology, better late than\nnever. There have been periods In my experi\nences, both by land and sea, when I was wont to\nexclaim with the cynic, -\'Life Is but a game, the\ndevil a croupier, and God knows irbo dealt \'.\nbut now that I have "danced with death" and\nbecome inoculated with the fever of change\nand chance, I feel a\'.mo-t unfit for the old order\nof things. In this benighted clime we are uu\ntrammeled by the more rigorous formalities,\naud as for the "moralities" they are nil we\'ve\nbeen "shipped somewhere East of Suez, where\nthe best is like the worst, where there areu\'t no\nTen Commandments, and a man can raise a\nthirst."\nYou have doubtless been filled to satiety with\ndescriptions of life and customs in the Philip\npiBe Islands, and through your columns many\nan embryouic statesman has settled forever\ngrave problems of governmental policy. Suffice\nit to remark, my pipe aud I have settled the\nwhole situation, but on account of our unassum\ning modesty, we are as dumb as the Sphinx.\nOur present location is most delightful. The\npueblo of Oroquleta fronts on the sea aud Is\ntlauked on the east by a mountain stream. The\nmountains are about fifteen miles from the coast\nline. A salt sea plunge at daylight, with a rinse\nIn the fresh water of the river, furnishes a\nhealthful appetizer for our frugal breakfast of\nbard-tack and bacou. The climate is all that\ncould be desired and by all odds the best in the\nArchipelago. f course we all have suffered\nfrom the usual attack of malarial fever in a\nmore or less virulent form, but so far no fatali\nties have resulted, and sluce we have become ac\nclimated I dare suy vou will search in vain for a\nhealthier, more robust set of men. But this Is\ntrue alone of the Northern coast of Mindanao,\nall other portions of the islands being germ\ninfested blots upon the face of God s green earth.\nWe have enjoyed an occasional brush with our\nfriend the enemy a sort of now you see them\nand now you don\'t affairs but as yet nothing\napproaching the magnitude of a serious engage\nment; and I\'m uot a hankerln\' after anything\nwarmer : the other fellow Is welcome to both the\nglory and the experience. The old boyhood\ngame of hide-and-go-seek" more nearly resem\nbles the campaign prosecuted in this Island than\naught else. The "Goo-goos" shoot and run and\nthe proverbial needle In the hay-stack is uot\nharder to find than it is to discover this crafty\nfoe In their mountain haunts. The dense tropi\ncal growth Indigenous to tbe mountains forms\nan ideal retreat, and the difficulties encountered\nin penetrating to the interior are almost past en\ndurance. A week In such going Is a test for the\nmost seasoned veteran. If the dastardly cow\nards would but stand and fight on chosen\nground, they could literally annihilate an entire\ncommand with little or no loss to themselves.\nMince May 2, 1901, about fiSO gee-slrfrigeut throats\nhave either been captnred by. or have surrend\nered to, the troops stationed at this post, and not\na few have been sent to that bourne from\nwhence no traveler returns. Not a bad record,\nthat.\nOn November 18, 1901, a detail of four soldiersi\nengaged in constructing a telephone line from\nthis point to an adjacent post, was attacked by\nbolo-men and but one escaped. Tbe bodies ol\ntbe other three were recovered by detachments\nfrom this command and brought here for burial.\nThe hunchback Richard\'s vision is but a pleasant\ndream compared to the memory ol our mutila\nted comrades each hewn and backed like a\n"carcass to be thrown to the hounds."\nAt tbe present writing Mars has beun ousted\nby Cupid aud tbe smoke of battle has given\nplaoe to the odor of orange blossoms. Marriages\nuuder the old regime were an expensive luxury,\ntbe cost ranging from fifty to three hundred dol\nlars. Since tbe advent of the Americans a civil\nceremony may be secured for a mere pittance.\nDischarged soldiers and husky hombres are tak"\ning advantage of the cut-rate and the prettiest\nand wealthiest of the senoritas are beli.g gob\nbled up ly the s( ore.\nTo stroll aloug the beach with a dark-eyed\nMestizo maiden, in such a night as Lorenzo\nstole to Htlmont. aud while away a passing hour\nby whi-periLii,\' -ai charine iuair.uties into her at\ntentive oar is not half bad : but & lor the closer\nrelation which touuts for better, for worse, ex\ncuse "Runyon." The natives are natural mu\nsicians, and when in the mood strum the strings\nto strains sweet and voluptuous, full of yearning\naud primitive feeling, mantling the cheek with\ncrimson and stirring the heart chords to their\ndepths. Each waltz is an unwritten poem,\nwhich stirs the unshod feet of the dusky beau\nties to graceful and rhythmic measure, and\nwhen one glides to the time of some old world,\nSpanish strain, life to lilm, as Mr. Dooley says,\n"I-wan gran\' Honolulu sun-set." In connection\nwith the dance I have it on good authority the\nfollowing conversation was overheard receutly\nbetween two belles of the town :\nCarmencita "Did I tell you, Maria mlo. about\nTeniente D \'"\nMaria "No, Carmencita mio, no got."\nCarmencita "Sabe He and I had a two-tep\ntogether and while dancing one of my slippers\ncame oil" and I ran a splinter into my toe.

Must you vamoose, Maria\' Well then,\nAdios!"\nIn outward form and ritualism tbe Filipinos\nare a devoutly religious people, constant in their\nfaith ; but if a moiety of them get to Heaven, as\nwas said of a great Cardinal, "the devil will have\nallowed himself to be robbed on the road."\nBlood-thirsty, cruel and treacherous, they can\nnot appreciate, and seldom observe, the rules and\nusages of civilized warfare. In short the average\nFilipino Is an excrescence, a fungus growth,\nand Qed knows what will be the produce if this\nalien race be grafted to the tree under whose\nshade we have so long rested In peace and con"\ntent. In Chicago it is said that every one looks\nas If they were going somewhere to do some\nthing: over here it look? as il every one were\ngolug nowhere to do nothing. Assimilation,\nwhich would uieau representation, is but a\ndream of the theorist, aud annexation without\nrepresentation is unquestionably foreign to our\nsystem of government. Without further refer\nence to tbe ultimate, who under the sun knows\nwhat is the present status of tbe Filipino\'\'\nAnother complication and a serious menace to\ntbe early settlement of the present situation. It\ntheMoro. Mohamedaos and fatalists by religion,\nthey rejoice in a soldier\'s death, believing that\nprecedence in Heaven is in accordance with tbe\nnumber of enemies slain in battle. They traffic\nin slaves and are not guiltless of bartering their\nown kith arid kin. Our government will not\nlong tolerate such practices, and the Filipino\ninsurrection, as compared to tbe struggle now\nimminent, will prove but as ancient strife with\nbattle ax and drum.\nMy convivial friends would be disappointed If\nI failed to mention the great national beverage,\n"tuba" a drink tit for tbe god. Made from\na certain bark and the sap of the cocoa, "it\nmakes a fellow feel somehow as he don\'t know\nnohow." Had the blind bard of Scio been\nfamiliar with the secret of its concoction, I am\nsatisfied he would have sung it Into immortality\ninstead of the nectar and ambrosia ot the\nOlympian deities.

The time at which he rises, his break\nfast hour, the time given to meals, are determin\ned by business obligations. He rushes through\nlunch because he "cau\'t spare the time from\nbusiness" to eat leisurely. He wont take a rest\nbecause he is needed at the store or office. He\nis in fact an absolute slave to business. The re\nsults which follow tbla slavery are to be seen on\nevery band.
