        <pre>['BOOKS IN REVIEW\nBy ROY\nTO OUTLAW WAR\nThe Great Decision. By J ames T. \nS hotwei.i.. (New York: The Mac\xad\nmillan Company. 1944. 234 pages, and \nAppendices and Index, $3.00.)\nIt is  surely not Professor Shot- \nwell’s fault if The Great Decision \nJoes not inspire the reader to \ngreater optimism about the com\xad\ning peace. In 1917-1918 Mr. Shot- \nwell was a member of the prepara\xad\ntory committee for the peace con\xad\nference, Chief of the Division of \nHistory and member of the Inter\xad\nnational Labor Legislation Com\xad\nmission at the Peace Conference \nin Paris. He has been a member of \nthe History Department of Co\xad\nlumbia University since 1900 and \nis at present Director of the Divi\xad\nsion of Economics and History of \nthe Carnegie Endowment for Inter\xad\nnational Peace. All his academic \ntraining and practical experience \nhave been brought to bear on the \nproblem of our post-war world ; yet \nall this cannot blot out of the read\xad\ner’s mind the more tedious and \npractical difficulties of the coming \npeace highlighted each day in the \ndaily papers.\n“The heart of the problem,” \nwrites Professor Shotwell, “is and \nremains: what is the effect of \nscience upon war as an instrument \nof politics—that is to say, upon \naggressive war.” He believes, as \ndo most of the rest of us, that the \nscientific total warfare of the twen\xad\ntieth century is so destructive and \nso terrible that it can no longer \nbe used as an instrument of poli\xad\ntics, because any state that uses it\n131\nHILLBROOK\nwill itself be destroyed in the en\xad\nsuing chaos. This may well be “the \nfundamental basis for the peace \nmovement.” It has also, according \nto Shotwell, made much more dif\xad\nficult the problem of liquidation, \nto which he devotes Part I of his \nbook. He discusses the problems \nof the relations of small and great \npowers, the difficulties between the \ngreat powers themselves, the \nchanges in the Russian constitu\xad\ntion, the beginnings of the United \nNations and the success of the \nMoscow Conference.\nIn Part II he takes up the “three \ngreat fields of international rela\xad\ntions: security, justice and liveli\xad\nhood.” In the field of justice he \nadvocates a strengthened World \nCourt; in the field of security, an \ninternational air force to police the \nworld; for improvement of the \nworld’s livelihood, permanent inter\xad\nnational committees for discussion \nand suggestion.\nAll of Professor Shotwell’s sug\xad\ngestions are tempered by his in\xad\ntimate knowledge of the defects in \nthe League of Nations; his own \nplan calls in actuality for a some\xad\nwhat altered League. He discusses \nthe role of the United States in \nthe new organization and unequi\xad\nvocally condemns the concept of \n“absolute, unqualified and un- \n■ checked sovereignty,” as “a con\xad\nception of anarchy.” In his own \nwords: “It is time that the politi\xad\ncians understood this fundamental \nfact and stopped talking about na\xad\ntional sovereignty as though there \nwere no limits to it.”\n', "CURRENT HISTORY, AUGUST, 1944\nThere can be no quarrel with this \nstatement; politicians would do \nwell to read this book. Nor do we \nneed to be convinced that we face a \ngreat decision as to whether we \nshall devote ourselves realistically \nto preparation for peace or to the’ \n“inescapable alternative,” prepara\xad\ntion for a third World War. Pro\xad\nfessor Shotwell offers no easy\nway out and he does not pretend \nto. Many of his suggestions are \nopen to criticism. Nevertheless his \nbook delves into the most impor\xad\ntant difficulties we face and offers \npractical suggestions for their \nsolutions. As such, it should be \nread not only by our politicians \nbut by all American voters, Demo\xad\ncrat and Republican.\nNOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS\nFROM D E S P O T I S M  T O  \nR E V O L U T I O N .  1768-1789\nB y  L e o  G e r s h o v . (New York: \nHarper & Brothers. 1944. 322 pages, \nillustrated, Bibliography and Index, \n$4.00.)\nThe latest in the Rise of Modern \nEurope Series, this book covers the \ntransition period in the years before \nthe French Revolution, when politi\xad\ncal statecraft was changing, freedom \nwas struggling for birth and the age \nof trade was dawning. Professor \nGershoy has made a fascinating \nstudy of the progress of humanity \nfrom the days of serfdom to the be\xad\nginnings of liberty in the various \nEuropean nations.\n* * +\nG E R M A N Y :  T H E  L A S T  P H A S E  \nBy Gunnar Pihl. (New York: Al\xad\nfred A. Knopf. 1944. 323 pages, \n$3.00.)\nIn a sense, this is one more war \n:orrespondent’s observations inside \njermany, but its value lies in its \nerious considerations of some of the \nnterna! problems under the Nazi \nregime. Pihl, a Swedish correspond\xad\nent, is not a prophet and makes but a \nslight attempt to forecast the future, \nalthough he appears to believe that \nwith a little encouragement Nazi ide\xad\nology can be exorcised from the Ger\xad\nman mind if the Allied Nations are \nvictorious. In his reports on what \nwent on inside Germany from late \n1941 to the middle of 1943, when lie \nwas escorted out, he has some excel \nlent comments on the results of the \nedicts and regulations passed by the \nparty, not always to the liking of the \npopulation, but always to be obeyed. \nHe watched the decline of moral val\xad\nues, the persecution of Jews, the eco\xad\nnomic struggle between classes. The \nstyle of the writing is neither racy \nnor inspired, but it is a good solid \nrecitation of facts and observations.\n*  *  *\nP R I M E R  O F  T H E  C O M IN G  \nW O R L D\nBy L eopold Schwarzciiii.ii. (New \nYork: Alfred A. Knopf. 1944. ,109 \npages, $3.00.)\nThose who are hopeful that n fair \nly sane and effective solution of the \npeace problem will be found should \nbe interested in Sehwarzehild's ex\xad\namination into the reasons for the \nfailure of the previous peace treaty, \nand his suggestions for the future. I le \nis not a novice at this; he was an \neditor and publisher in pre Hitler \nGermany. His emphasis for separa\xad\ntion of the question of a peace treaty \nand some form of international \nleague or council is apparently justi-\n", 'BOOKS IN REVIEW 133\nfied by reference to the experience \nof 1918. Some of his conclusions \nseem too drastic to be practical, even \nthough much to be desired. One of \nthese is the idea of returning Japan \nto the islands whence she started to \nexpand in the 1890s. But it is un\xad\nfair to find fault with such theories, \nbecause some solution will be found, \neven though it be a compromise. The \ngeneral excellence of the book, its \nsimple style and common sense eval\xad\nuation of men and nations, commend \nit as one of the best on the subject.\n* * *\nGALLIC CHARTER \nFoundations of Tomorrow’s France. \nBy J. C. F ernand-L aurent. (Bos\xad\nton: Little, Brown & Company.\n1944. 280 pages, $2.50.)\nThere have been several books ex\xad\ntolling or pleading the cause of \nFrance, commending de Gaulle or \ncondemning Petain. Most of them \nleave great gaps in their convincing \neffects. In fact, there has been so \nmuch confusion and cross-debate in \nthe French situation that the reader \ncan be forgiven for a cynical opinion. \nFernand-Laurent’s book, however, \nhas an opposite effect. After summar\xad\nizing briefly earlier French history, \nhe relates enough of the activities of \nrecent French leaders to excite sym\xad\npathy for the people and some under\xad\nstanding of the cross currents of the \npolitics that made first Petain and \nthen Laval. Undoubtedly there might \nbe contrary explanations, for the au\xad\nthor was active politically himself, \nbut his presentation is so clearly of\xad\nfered and so realistically stated that \nhis countrymen are indebted to him \nfor a service well rendered.\n* * *\nVIA DIPLOMATIC POUCH \nBy Douglas M iller. (New Y ork: \nDidier. 1944. 246 pages and Biblio\xad\ngraphy, $3.00.)\nIt is an amazingly lucid story that\nMiller, former American Commercial \nAttache in Berlin, has put together \nfrom his confidential reports to \nWashington, made in the ’thirties. \nSome of the information has been \npublished elsewhere, but in the pres\xad\nent form the growth of Naziism’s \ntentacles can be visualized as they \nfattened on Germany. Several ob\xad\nservations made in 1933 might have \nanswered earlier sympathizers. At \nthat time he noted that the younger \nGermans were willing to return to \na medieval status; that the popula\xad\ntion of its own choice had given the \nparty complete authority; that the \nwealthy class originally supported the \nmovement as a counter to Commu\xad\nnism, as they thought. If these were \nhindsight it would not be important; \nas a contemporary record it is most \nenlightening.\n*  *  *\nRUSSIA AND THE PEACE \nBy Bernard P ares. (New York: \nThe Macmillan Company. 1944. 236 \npages and Index, $2.50.)\nSir Bernard Pares has been a close \nstudent of Russian affairs for more \nthan 40 years, both from within and \nwithout. It is not sufficient to say he \nis sympathetic to the Stalin regime; \nhe is militantly for it and devotes \nmost of this book to recounting the \ncourse of Russia since the revolution, \nwith inferences and conclusions to \nprove that world fear of Communism \nis an unnecessary stumbling block to \nunderstanding. He covers the Balkan \nstates and their problems, and the \nquestion of Japan. So far as peace is \nconcerned, only complete faith in \nRussia will enable the Allied Nations \nto arrive at permanent solutions.\n*  *  *\nI SEE A NEW  CHINA \nBy George H ogg. Boston: Little, \nBrown & Company. 1944. 211 pages, \n$2.50.)\nAn Oxford graduate, a former\n', "134 CURRENT HISTORY, AUGUST, 1944\npress correspondent and always an \ninveterate seeking after information, \nHogg relates what he saw of the \nChinese Industrial Cooperatives in \nthe five years he has been an organ\xad\nizer and teacher in that new group. \nOccasionally you hear of them; the \nback-country factories where most \nthings are made by hand in the des\xad\nperate struggle to keep up some form \nof manufacturing of essentials for \nthe needs of China despite Japanese \nbombing and occupation. While Hogg \ntells how the Chinese are working \nout this problem, there is consider\xad\nably greater interest in reading what \nhe saw of e%'eryday life in the vil\xad\nlages, farms and mountains, all told \nin a matter of fact, entertaining fash\xad\nion.\n* * *\nT H E  F R E N C H  C O L O N I E S  \nBy J acques Stern. (New York: \nDidier. 1944. 264 pages. Statistical \nSurvey, Appendix, Bibliography and \nIndex, $3.00.)\nThe author, former French Min\xad\nister of Colonies, makes the case for \nthe necessity for the return of her \ncolonies to France after the war. In \nhis view, France profited by the mis\xad\ntakes of early administrations by giv\xad\ning her colonies practically full equal\xad\nity with the mother country, and ap\xad\nparently those colonies will be eager \nfor that restoration. Incidentally, he \ngives a wealth of information on the \ncolonies and their history. While it \nis only one side of the question, it is \nably presented.\n* * *\nT H E  M I R A C L E  O F  A M E R I C A  \nBy A ndre Maurois. (New York: \nHarper & Brothers. 1944. 400 pages, \nillustrated, Bibliography and Index, \n$3.50.)\nIn his preface, A. Maurois hopes \nthis work will be useful first, to the \nFrench reader, and then perhaps to \nthe American reader as a view of a\nforeign friend. The first objective \nmight be served, but in his zeal to \ncondense the vast picture of America \nof 160 years, his reflections frequent\xad\nly give a bizarre idea of us, with \nemphasis on the superficial rather \nthan on the main body of the popu\xad\nlation.\n*  *  *\nT H E  S I X  W E E K S ’ W A R  \nFrance, May 10-June 25, 1940. By \nT heodore Draper. (New York: \nViking Press. 1944. 322 pages, Ap\xad\npendices and Index, $3.00.)\nThe story of the military defeat \nsuffered by France in this war, the \nshort-lived campaign against Ger\xad\nmany and above all the internal dis\xad\nsensions which helped the invader, \nform the basis for this recapitulation. \nAn idea of Draper’s viewpoint may \nbe gained from one remark: “Mar\xad\nshal Retain and Pierre Laval were \nfighting for Germany in Bordeaux \nmuch more effectively than the Ger\xad\nman infantry-engineer team in the \n‘Maginot Line.’”\n*  *  *\nT H E  N A V Y ’S  W A R  \nBy F letcher P ratt. (New York: \nHarper & Brothers. 1944. 288 pages, \nillustrated, maps, charts and Index, \n$2.75.)\nSomewhat in the nature of an of\xad\nficial record, this book bears the \nblessing of Secretary Knox in the \nform of a foreword. It tells the story \nof the Navy’s part in the war, based \nupon documents and reports of the \nNavy Department as well as the au\xad\nthor’s observations.\n*  *  *\nP R O D U C T I O N .  J O B S  A N D  \nT A X E S\nBy H arold M. Groves. (New York: \nMcGraw-Hill Book Co. 1944. 112 \npages and Index, $1.25.)\nSponsored by the Committee for \nEconomic Development, this study by\n", "BOOKS IN REVIEW 135\nProfessor Groves endeavors to show \nthe relation between federal taxa\xad\ntion and the opportunities to create \npost-war employment. Among the \nsuggestions are a broader tax base \nfor income taxes, and greater con\xad\nsideration for business losses and \nhigher incomes.\n* * *\nPSYCHIATRY AND THE WAR  \nEdited by Frank J. Sladen, M.D. \nSpringfield, 111.: Charles C. Thomas. \n1944. 464 pages and Index, $5.00.) \nThis is a survey of the significance \nof psychiatry in its application to \nhuman problems during and after the \nwar. It is a record of the Conference \non Psychiatry held at Ann Arbor, \nMichigan, in October, 1942, and is \ncomposed of papers by some 40 medi\xad\ncal authorities on the subject.\nAMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL \nDEVELOPMENT\nBy Carl Brent S w isher . (Boston:\nHoughton, Mifflin Company. 1943.\n1029 pages, Bibliographical Note and\nIndex, $6.00.)\nProfessor Swisher (Johns Hopkins \nUniversity) has made a study of the \nsubject from the beginning of the \nAmerican Revolution through part \n(of necessity) of the present conflict. \nIn addition to the judiciary functions \nof the federal government, the legis\xad\nlative and executive branches are \nconsidered. Of principal general in\xad\nterest, naturally, are the chapters \ndealing with conditions during and \nsince the first World War, organiza\xad\ntion and control in wartime, the New \nDeal and the Supreme Court in tran\xad\nsition.\n“ P a t r i o t s  f i r s t ,”  is the service motto of a certain glazier in a small Dutch \ntown. It is a motto translated into action each time Allied air raids on nearby \ntargets blow out the town’s window panes.\nThe glazier then has more business than he can ordinarily handle. But \nhandle it he does in a manner most satisfactory to his conscience and most \nprovoking to the local Nazis. First on his list of homes to be repaired are \nthose of avowed anti-Nazis. Next to be serviced, complained the Nazi news\xad\npaper, Volk en Vaderland, are those of people hostile to the occupation \nauthorities, but less vociferous about it. '\nPolitical neutrals are further down on the glazier’s priority list. Last on \nhis calling card are Nazi sympathizers and party members—they see the \nglazier only if he has any repair material left, the paper bitterly commented. \n“From the sequence in which windows are repaired,” the publication con\xad\ncluded, “the community can identify with unfailing accuracy the home owner’s \npolitical complexion.”\n—Netherlands Information Bureau\nI f  America’s oil wells give out, the United States still will have an oil reserve \nof 100 billion barrels, according to some estiniates of the amount of oil shale \nin this country. Oil has been extracted experimentally from this shale at a \ncost of about $1.25 a barrel.\nLarge quantities of the oil shale are found in Colorado, Utah and Wyo\xad\nming. Two naval oil shale reserves were established in this area in 1916, and \na third has since been added.\n—National Geographic News Bulletin\n"]</pre>
