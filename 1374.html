        <pre>['Judith Gap Journal\nVOL. 6. NO. I.\nJUDITH QAP. MONTANA. FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 14, 1913.\nPRICE. FIVE CENTS\nMONTANA\'S YIELD OF\nWHEAT COMES FIRST\nIn comparison with the production\nof 22 states, Montana stands first in\noverage yield per acre on winter\nwheat, on spring fvheat, on rye and\non barley, and second on (lax, accor\nding to estimates prepared and print\ned in a recent issue of the Northwest\nFarmstead at Minneapolis.\nWhile Montana\'s total production\nfalls far short of that of some of the\nother states, the average is way above\nThis state\'s average yield of winter\nwheat is estimated at 30 bushels\' an\nacre. The estimate places the total\nacreage at 550,000 bushels and the to\ntal yield at 10,500,000 bushels. Wash\nington is given ah average yield of\nK8 bushels. Montana\'s spring wheat\nla fixed at 20 bushels, the total acre\nage at 250,000 and the total produc\ntion of 6,500,000 bushels. Oregon\'s\naverage of 23 bushels is given second\nplace.\nThis state is credited with having\n12,000 acres in rye this year averag\ning 23 bushels to the acre or 209,000\nbushels in all. Minnesota takes sec\nond place in the rye column with an\naverage of 21 bushels.\n. The total barley production of Mon\ntana this year is fixed at 1.005,000 bu\nahels, the total Acreage sowed to the\nProp at 45,000 acres and an average\nper acre of 37 bushels.\nMontana is given second place in\nthe average production per acre of\nflax. Its average yield per acre this\njear is estimated at 12 bushels. Wis\nconsin leads it by one bushel more.\nThe state is credited with having 620.\nCOO acres planted iu (lax and yielded a\ntotal of 7,440,000 bushels.\nAdditional Local\n; Contractor J. 1*. Deitrick of Moore,\nwas iu town the first of the week\n■making arrangements to raise some\n-of the buildings on lower Main street.\nWalter Hard and O. F. Deyarmon\nwill undoubtedly have their buildings\nraised a foot or more.\nMr. and Mrs. M. C. Singleton were\nin the city on Monday. They spent\na few days on the ranch west of town.\nThey make their home on the Ford\nranch adjoining Harlowton, where\nMr. Singleton attends to the interests\nof the Penwell company.\nMrs. Mary Carlyle and her daugh\nter, Mrs. Robert Rucher were in the\ncity on Monday from the Bucher\nranch north of here. Mrs. Carlyle\nlias arranged with E. E. Barrows for\nthe purchase of his residence proper\non High street.\nAttorney Robert N. Jones and\nManager Charles Reiff of the Mar\nshall store, of Harlowton, were in\nthe city on Monday. A few days\nprevious they were stalled near here\nwith an auto and were forced to leave\nit, thus necessitating a trip up here\non Monday.\nCyrus A. Grandy had a field of fif\nty acres of winter wheat which, ac\ncording to reports received at this of\nfice made an average yield of 24 bu\nshels per acre. This is a very good\nyield in view of the fact that it was a\nstrictly dry farmed crop.\nMrs. Chester Burgess and children\nleft for Whitehall, Wis., about ten\ndays ago where they will visit until\nafter the holidays. Mrs. Burgess\'\nparents reside iu that town.\n< Iu a recent issue or the Journal we\nstated that Mr. and Mrs. O. A. Wei*\nser were now located in New York\nwhere they would remain permanent\nly. In a letter of recent date Mr.\nWeiser took exception to this state\nment, saying that he and Mrs. Wei\nser would remain in that city only so\nlong as was necessary for them to se\ncure funds sullicient to stock the\nranch as they have always desired to\nhave it, and from then on they will\nmake their home here. He also\nstates that it has come to his know\nledge that iiis ranch house had been\nbroken into receutlv and valuable ar\nticles stolen. He further says a re\nward will be paid to the person fur\nnishing information which will lead\nto the conviction of any persons mo\nlesting his property.\nin\nSanford Dodge\nand his company\nof artists will be\nthe city next\nWednesday even\ning and will pre\nsent a high class\nperformance.\nCARE OF CREAM AND\nMAKING OF RUTTER\nWatchfulness Necessary to Se\ncure Best Results.\nCLEANLINESS MOST ESSENTIAL\nThe churning of butter on the farm\nis done usually in small quantities for\nhome use. It holds about the same\nposition in the domestic order of\nthings as the baking of the bread.\nEvery housekeeper has learned that\nthere are three things to be kept in\nmind in order to get good bread. First,\ntbe flour or raw material must be\nkept clean, dry and free from impuri\nties; Becond, It must be mixed with\nwater and the proper kind of yeast\nbacteria, then kept at the proper tem\nperature so that these little yeast or\nganisms may become active, grow,\nmultiply and produce gas; third, the\nbread must be baked at a certain time\nIn order to stop the action of the\nbacteria. The majority of housekeep\ners know how to keep the Hour and\nhow to mix the ingredients. But the\none thing they must learn by expe\nrience is the exact point when the\ndough is ready to bake—when the\ndough is light.\nHas it ever occurred that bread\nmaking and buttermaking are very\nBimilar? Just the same with cream\nas with flour, the first essential is a\ngood raw product. The only way to\nhave good cream is to separate it\nwith a clean separator, then put it\ninto clean utensils and cool it imme\ndiately each time after separating be\nfore adding to the churn supply. It\nis often the case on the farm where\nbut one or two cows are kept that\nfresh sweet cream is added to the\nchurn supply daily in small amounts\nwithout being properly cooled until\nenough is at hand to churn.\ne|e e|a\nCHURNING POINT—In breadmak\ning the yeast must be kept in a dry,\ncool place so the yeast germs will not\nbecome active. With cream one must\nkeep the churn supply of cream cool\ned to about 50 degrees F. until a\nfew hours before ready to churn.\nWhen it comes time to ripen the\ncream for churning do the same as\nwhen setting the bread. Stir all the.\n. cream up thoroughly and set at about\n70 degrees F., or room temperature.\nAt this temperature the lactic acid\nbacteria become very active and mul\ntiply rapidly, developing lactic acid,\nwhich sours or ripens the cream. The\nexact point of ripeness or the time\ntc churn is when the cream has a\nclean sour taste when taken into the\nmouth. Like the rising of the bread\ntbe knowledge of this point must be\nacquired by experience.\n+ + +\nOVER RIPENING.—There is a\npoint in souring of cream when the\nbacteria wiU have developed so much\nacid that, they will become Inactive.\nIn other words, the lactic acid be\ncomes so concentrated that these\nbacteria cannot change any more of\nthe sugar into acid. It is at this\npoint where the putrlfactive type of\nbacteria begin their work. These fel\nlows work upon the casein and pro\nduce gat Instead of acid. These are\nthe same kind that cause decay in all\nvegetable or animal matter, bence\nwhen they have a chance to develop\nin the creese, whether from keeping\nthe cream in too warm surroundings\nor holding it too long before churn\ning, bad flavors will develop in the\ncream which are sure to appear in\nthe butter. Don\'t ovorrlpen the cream.\nWhen the proper point Is reached\nin the rising of the bread it is put in\nto tbe ovon. The heat of the baking\nkills tbe bacteria and the bread is\nsterilized, which makes it keep for a\nlong time. In churning when the\ncream has ripened to the right point\nit Is put into the churn and agitated.\nThe churning collects the butterfat\nso it can be separated from the but\ntermilk and washed free of the sugar\nand the casein—the two constituents\nwhich feed these bacteria that pro\nduce acid in one case and bad smell\ning gases in the other.\nTHNSHIP 11*15 SURVEY D\nI\'LINGS AFTER DEC. 2\n! - l>;irtmeut of the Interior, 1 S.\nLa. d (lice, Lewistown, Montana,Oo\nloi * r. !, 1913.\n•luv i-hereby given that tic he\nrev ■ of township lln, range lSe,\nm , tins been surveyed.\n1 plat of survey of the land\' af\nfe 1 will be filed in this offle- on\ni)> - j 9J8, after which this utu • is\np d to receive appiicatin, to\net select said lauds; also pli\nca adjust existing claie, to\n81\n1.

Nichols plead guilty to\nassault in the third degree upon the\nperson of W. E. Webber on Nov. 5,\nin Justice of the PeaceReadel\'s court\non Monday evening and was fined\n$300 and t he cost of the case. A cash\npayment of $50, togettier with the\ncosts which were $29.40, was paid,\nand the balance of $250 will be due\nand payable if Mr. Nichols is still\nwithin the confines of the state on\nSaturday evening.\nThe case was called shortly after 2\np. m. with Deputy County Attorney\nHusband representing the state and\nG. S. Bills for Mb. Nichols. A large\ncrowd gathered in Kierstead\'s hall to\nhear the case. The charge was for\nassault in the second degree, but af\nter hearing all of the testimony At\ntorney Husband agreed to reduce the\ncharge if Nichols would plead guiltv.\nHe refused to do this, but upon being\nimportuned by his bondsmen and\nothers lie agreed.\nIn view of the fact that lie had al\nready sold his property and was al\nmost in readiness to leave the state\nit was decided to hurry his departure\nIn preference to binding him over to\nthe district court as appeared inevit\nable from the testimony given.\nThe two men had been friendlv for\nmonths until a few moments prior to\nthe assault. They were settling up\naccounts and met with a difference of\na few dollars which brought about\nheated words. Nichols picked up a\nsmall stone and the trouble started,\nalthounh there was a variance of tes\ntimony as to who struck first it was\ndeduced that Nichol was the aggres\nsor. According to his own testimony\nlie struck Webber over the head ten\ntimes or more, but was certain that\nthe rock was so covered by his .hand\nthat it did not iullict the wounds up\non tlie head.\nWhile passing sentence Judge\nReadel gave the prisoner a nice little\ntalk. Among other things he said,\n\'•The people of this section ingeneral\nfeel that it is about time for you to\nleave and I will give you 15 days iu\nwhich to do so and if in that time you\nhave hot left the suspended fine of\n$250 will be payable." At this point\nMr. Nicliol interposed and said that\nfive days would be sufficient time to\ngive him iu which to leave the state,\nand that he would be gone in three\ndays.\nEpiscopal Services.\nEpiscopal services at the Congrega\ntional church on Tuesday, Nov, is,\n1913, at 7:30 p. m.

The\nconsideration was $52.000.\nMr. McFarland got an excellent\npiece ot land and lie may consider\nhimself very fortunate iu getting\nsuch a large piece of land so close\nto two such live towns as Oka and\nJudith Gap.\nMr. McFarland and his sons will\nmove out here either this fall or in\nthe spring, and make one of the finest\nranches out of the recent purchase\nttiat will be found in this section of\nthe state.\nCOMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS FOR\nMIDSHIPMEN TO ANNAPOLIS ACADEMY\nSenator Walsh and Congressman\nStout each have the opportunity to\nname a midshipman to the United\nStates Naval Academy at Annapolis,\nwho will be entitled to enter at the\nbeginning of tin* next school year.\nThey have botli decided to make the\nappointments upon the result of a\ncompetitive examination. This will\nbe held at the assembly room of the\nHigh school in the city of Helena,\ncommencing on Saturday morning,\nthe 14th day ot December, 1913, at\nnine o\'clock and will he conducted\nby lion.

Good mutton should be cov\nered evenly with firm white fat. The\ncolor of the flesh varies from a very\ndark red in old, thin mutton to a\ncherry red in the best grade of fat,\nnative mutton. It should be free\nfrom disagreeable odors and the car\ncass should be dry to the touch. In\nmutton of best quality the lean meat\nshould be fine grained, smooth or\nvelvety to the touch and have an ad\nmixture of fat with the lean.\nAll classes of sheep carcasses\nshould carry an even, moderately\nthick covering of fat, to make really\nhigh class cuts. Fat meat always has\nmore flavor than thin meat. It con\ntains less water and does not shrink\nso much in cooking.\nMutton and lamb should be used\nto a greater extent by our people for\nthe following reasons: It is as cheap\nMUTTON OF QUALITY.\nas beef and the stewing cuts are\ngenerally the cheapest meats that\ncan be purchased. Cleanly dressed\nmutton and lamb Is just as palatable\nas any other class of meat and many\npeople maintain that it has a better\nflavor. Whole or half carcasses of\nmutton may be used by the family\nbefore the meat spoils. They furnish\na change from the constant use of\nbeef and pork. Sheep have very few\ncontagious diseases and fewer sheep\ncarcasses are condemned in packing\nplants than any other class of ani\nmals.\nDAIRYING ASSURES\nPROSPERITY TO ALL\nState Dairy Commissioner J. D.\nScholes lias said and done very\nmuch which has been beneficial to\nMontana\'s dairying progress. He is\nan experienced dairy man himself\nand knows from actual experience\njust what dairy stock will do for\nfarmers, their families, and also for\nthe people in general. Commenting\nupon the business, the dairy commis\nsioner some time ago said among\nother tlieings the following:\n\'\'This department was created to\nassist in every way it can the dairy\ninterests of the state. Whenever a\ncommunity is thinking of creating a\ncreamery, we will be glad to send a\nman there and lex.d every aid and to\ngive it the benefit of the experience\nthat lias been obtained elsewhere.\n"There are 48 creameries in Mon\ntana but only about 30 are in opera\ntion. The others were forced to sus\npend through unfair competition,\npoor management or other causes.\nHer Imps this department can help to\nrectify bad management, and under\nterms of the anti-discrimination laws\nnow oil the statute books unfair com\npetition is no longer a factor.\n"A creamery does more to build up\nthe average country community than\nany other one tiling. It affords the\nfarmers an opportunity of receiving\na tidy sum in cash eacli month, and\nit seems to have the effect of keeping\nthe communities money at home. In\nstead of sending away lor mail-order\ngoods, the farmer buys from bis home\nmerchant and pays cash.\n"In some communities merchants\nhave adopted a very shortsighted pol\nicy and because they could buy east\nern butter for two or three cents less\na pound than they could get it for at\nthe local creamery, they \'\' refused to\nbuy the local product. Then the\nfarmers only had cash at crop time\nand instead of buying from the home\nmerchants, orders large bills of goods\niu the east.\n"The Townsend creamery is an ex\nample of a successful plant. I hap\npen to be familiar with that. It 1ms\ndone more for Broadwater county\nthan almost any thingelse. It has\nmade the farmers realize the profits\nthat can be obtained from\napplication to business and the adop\ntion of modern business methods.\n"One farmer who sent cream to the\nTownsend plant received a monthly\ncheck of $260 for his butter fat. Re\nmember he had the skim milk to\nfatten hogs. A herd of eight or ten\ncows means a monthly check of $75\nor $ 80 .\n"It\'s the dairy cow that\'s going to\ntake the curse off couutry life.* \'', 'THE JUDITH HAP JOURNAL\nLYLE A.

The American was siitllciently\ndangerous wheu he hud only suspicion\nof the plot to dethrone the king, but\nnow that he was iu actual possession\nof the details he was a marked object\nfor death. The prince did not wel\ncome a hand to hand conflict with the\nAmerican if he could avoid it. Now the\npresence of the guard would have\nbeen doubly welcome, so he cursed\nIladulski for his tardiness in bringing\nthem.\nThe prince had come to the hasty\nconclusion that there was but one safe\nway to deal with this interfering\nAmerican, and that was to seud him\nto jail—at least until after the king had\nbeen dethroned and the prince bad\ntaken his place as ruler.\n"By the way. prince, will I have time\nfor a cigarette before the guard ar\nrives?" calmly inquired Hawthorne.\n"Curse you," fumed the prince, "if\nyon smoko tonight you\'ll smoke in\nhades!"\n"Thanks," bowed Hawthorne.
