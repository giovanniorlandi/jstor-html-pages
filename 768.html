        <pre>['Constitutional Law of June 3, 1958 115\nD e Gaulle’s Statement to the National Assembly\nOn June 1 de Gaulle appeared before the French Assembly to present his \nprogram for the restoration of order in France at home and overseas:\nThe rapidly accelerating degradation of \nthe State, the immediate danger to French \nunity, Algeria in the throes of trials and \nemotions, Corsica suffering from a feverish \ncontagion, opposing movements in Metro\xad\npolitan France hourly whipping up their \npassions, and reinforcing their action, the \narmy, long tried by sanguinary and praise\xad\nworthy tasks, but shocked by the lack of any \nreal authority, our international position \ndisparaged even within our alliances—such \nis.the situation of our country. At this very \nmoment, when so many opportunities, in \nso many directions, are offered to France, \nshe finds herself threatened by disruption \nand perhaps even civil war.\nI t is in these circumstances that I  offered \nmy services to try, once again, to lead the \ncountry, the State and the Republic to safety; \nand that, designated by the Chief of State, \nI  have been led to ask the National Assembly \nto invest me with a heavy task.\nIn order to perform this task, means are \nnecessary.\nIf you invest this Government, it will pro\xad\npose that you give it these means right away. \nI t will ask you for full powers in order to \nbe in a position to act with all the effective\xad\nness, speed and responsibility demanded by \nthe circumstances. It will ask you for these \npowers for a period of six months, hoping \nthat at the end of this time—order having \nbeen re-established in the State, hope re\xad\ngained in Algeria, unity restored in  the \nnation—it will be possible for the public \npowers to resume their normal course.\nBut what good would be a temporary \nremedy, a remedy of sorts, for a disastrous \nstate of affairs unless we decided to eradicate \nthe deep-seated cause of our troubles? This \ncause—die Assembly knows and the nation \nis convinced of it—is the confusion and, by \nthe same token, the helplessness of consti\xad\ntuted authority.\nThe Government which I shall form, pro\xad\nvided I obtain your vote of confidence, will \nsubmit to you without delay a bill reforming \nArticle 90 of the Constitution, thus enabling \nthe National Assembly to give a mandate \nto the Government to formulate and then \npropose to the country, through a referen\xad\ndum, the indispensable changes. In  the \nexplanatory statement, which will be sub\xad\nmitted to you at the same time as the text, \nthe Government will specify the three prin\xad\nciples which must be the basis of the republi\xad\ncan regime in France and to which it pledges \nthat its bill will conform: universal suffrage \nis the source of all power; the executive and \nthe legislative branches must be separate and \napart so that the Government and the Parlia\xad\nment can, each for its own part and on its \nown responsibility, assume its full powers; \nthe Government must be responsible to the \nParliament.\nThrough the same constitutional reform, \nthe country will be given a formal opportu\xad\nnity to organize the relations between the \nFrench Republic and the peoples associated \nwith it. The Government will pledge itself \nto promote this new organization in the draft \nwhich it will put to the vote of the women \nand men of France.\nHaving received this double mandate, con\xad\nferred on it by the National Assembly, the \nGovernment will be able to undertake the \nimmense task which will have thus been \ndefined. If I am to assume this double man\xad\ndate, I  shall first and foremost need your \nconfidence. Then the Parliament must with\xad\nout delay—for events do not permit of any \ndelay—enact into law the bills which be \nsubmitted to it. These laws once passed, the \nAssemblies will adjourn until the date set \nfor the opening of their next regular session. \nThus the Government of the Republic, hav\xad\ning been invested by the elected representa\xad\ntives of the nation and given, with extreme \nurgency, the means for action can then be \nresponsible for the unity, integrity and inde\xad\npendence of France.\nThe Constitutional Law of June 3, 1958\nOn June 3, the Assembly accepted de Gaulle’s constitutional reform law.\n']</pre>
