        <pre>['[JKohaw Count, VOL XXX, Injury to Mining Industry, Claim owners and mining men, throughout Tintie are greatly incensed, over the decision of the authorities at, Washington in regard to the patenting, of mining claims and declare that the, ruling is one of the most severe blows, that has been delivered against the, great mining Industry in recent years, It is quite evident that these officials, are trying to follow a literal meaning, of the mining laws with no intention, or desire to temper their rulings with, common sense For years it has been, the custom of claim owners to perform, the required amount of assessment, work each year and after the legal, amount of improvements bad been in, stalled upon the ground it was only, necessary to demonstrate to the satis, faction of the government authorities, that the claims were mineral bearing, and that the application for patent was, not contested where upon the patent, would be carried along to successful, conclusion The new ruling expressly, states that in order to secure a patent, the existence of valuable mineral de, posits must be more clearly demon, strated In other words the claim own, er must expose within the limits of his, claim a vein or lode of mineral bearing, rock possessing a present or prospect, ive value for mining, The Tintie district embraces an area, of perhaps ten square miles and now, contains in the neighborhood of 3000, patented claims but only in isolatea, spots does the mineral crop to the sur, face Perhaps less than twenty of, these claims could have been patented, under the new interpolation of the, mineral laws Tintie has produced ap, proximately 50000000 during the past, forty years and while the ground is, absolutely valueless for anything except, mining the enforcement of the new, ruling from the interior department, would make it impossible for a claim, owner to secure a government patent, The first thing that the man with cap, ital for investment in mining property, demands is a clear title and only by, government patent can he be given this, assurance In most of the mines of, this section ore of a commercial grade, was found only after the expenditure, of large sums of money and it is not, reasonable to suppose that mining com, panies are going to spend thousands oi, dollars in development work and then, after opening ore hundreds of feet be, low the surface take a chance of hav, ing expensive litigation to prove a title, to their claims The day when the, prospector searched the hills for crop, pings of pay ore is past He now lo, cates his claims whore geological condi, tions are favorable and only by patent, can he be sure that the results of his, labor can be secured to himself and as, sociates, In mining sections like the Tintie, district where the ground is of no value, for agricultural purposes where there, is no timber or water the best way, out of the difficulty would be to make, everything within a certain area sub, ject to patent, The mining men of the west will, hardly be expected to stand for such, radical legislation as that which is, now being passed out to them Report, er Eureka Utah, American Mines and Works Pay, Big Dividends, With 83 American mines and works, contributing disbursments during the, iirst quarter of 1912 according to re, ports made from the Mining and En, gineering World totaled 217O0390S, This compares with 21849031 in the, same period in 1911 with 96 mines par, ticipating Had it not been for the, falling off in disbursements made by, the Canadian and Mexican companies, the quarters declarations would have, made a record in American mine divi, dend payments, When it is taken into consideration, that these dividend payments result, from the operations of only gold silver, copper lead zinc and quicksilver, mines and do not include the millions, of dollars paid by other companies, whose products include iron coal pe, troleum cement etc and in addition, the so called rare minerals the magni, tude of the American mining industry, can be better understood, That the operation of gold silver, lead zinc and quicksilver properties, has been long profitable taken as a, whole is evidsneed by the dividend, payments of the above mentioned 83, companies which have since their in, corporation distributed among the, stockholders a total of 660063272, Were the total disbursements made by, the 300 or more companies quoted in, the dividend paying tables published, elsewhere in Mining and Engineering, World paying dividends prior to 1912, but not in 1912 added to the above it, would make a startling total well up, in the billions of dollars in fact, For the first time in many months by, reason of the improved prices for the, red metal the copper properties as, sume the lead in the dividend pay, ments the quarters disbursments show, ing that with 19 companies contribut, ingnearly one half of the quarters, total of 9798218 was paid by the pro, ducers of copper These 19 properties, have certainly had a most profitable, career for to date -holders of their, stocks have been enriched to the ex, tent of 328059541 On the combined, issued capital of these companies this, is a return equivalent to 153 per cent, of 114503880 in excess of outstanding, capital All but two of these operate, properties in the United States these, two being the Cananea Central and, Greene Consolidated of Mexico the, former paying its first dividend, amounting to 360000, Of the 83 companies paying dividends, in 1912 57 are classed as gold silver-lead-zinc, producers These distribut, ed among shareholders during the, quarter just ended 7507104 and since, incorporation 204482365 Thirty, eight of these properties are located in, the United States and they contributed, 4985622 during the past quarter and, 149287145 since incorporation twelve, are Canadian properties with 2100739, to their credit for the quarter and 30, 903400 since incorporation But six, companies participated and in a small, way owing to the revolution the dis, bursements totaling but 390743 for, the quarter, Six metallurgical companies contrib, uted 43G5068 to the quarters total, against 5279343 in the same quarter, of 1911 To date these companies have, declared dividends totalling 126581, 365, Eight security holding corporations, were able to share among owners of, their stock 3330751 as compared with, 6599159 paid by the same number, during the same period in 1911 To, date the eight companies ave paid out, a total of 135001246 Mining World, Another Strike in Magma Mine, Supt Jas Neary of the Magma com, pany was here Saturday on his way, home from Phenix Another wonder, ful strike has just been made in the, Magma mine on the 800 foot level A, crosscut has been extended through a, band of quartzite and another most re, markable pay streak encountered, The streak is four feet wide and the, ore for this entire width averaged 72, per cent copper and 50 ounces silver, per ton This ore Is next thing to bul, lion The crosscut also demonstrated, that the vein at the 800 level is fully, sixty feet wide and carries phenomenal, values in copper and silver all the way, across the sixty feet No copper mine, in the world can equal the Magma in, richness The new boilers for the, Magma are on their way from Florence, to the mine and will be set as quickly, as possible Forty thousand pressed, brick to be used in enclosing these boil, ers will arrive here this week and be, forwarded to the mine at once The, work of raising the new triple compart, ment shaft from the 800 foot level to, the surface is progressng rapidly and, the shaft will probably be completed, by the time the mammoth new hoist, arrives Supt Neary knows how to, handle his force to the best advantage, in breaking ground and timbering and, there is something doing all the time, underground at the Magma Florence, Blade Tribune, Chief Consolidated, The Chief Consolidated with its 400, acres is the largest group in area in, the Tintie district Equipment in, cludes a complete modern plant cost, ing with foundations and buildings, 76000 Development is by a 1775 foot, three compartment vertical shaft, The property was taken over three, years ago having an 800 foot shaft but, no ore, Production of ore from Feb 16 1909, to Dec 31 1911 inclusive gave net, smelter returns of 312894 secured, largely from development work In, 1911 ore production was much smaller, than had been anticipated amounting, to only 104522 net smelter returns, owing to a combination of hard luck, when the principal ore shoot faulted, both north and south practically, simultaneously but the ore has been, picked up on the north where it was, side faulted and there are strong in, dications that the shoot will be picked, up to the south shortly where faulted, downward, Production in 1911 was largely of, low grade ore but in addition to pick, ing up the old ore shoot where faulted, to the north ore bodies of hitrh value, have been opened within the past few, months and there are now five good, stopes in operation which number, should be increased materially during, the present year, The most recent development of im, portance is the opening of an entirely, new shoot of ore on the 1000 foot, level of about 10 feet wide carrying, 60 to 90 ounces silver and about 2, gold per ton from which ore is now, being stoped During the latter part, of March the mine was shipping 16, carloads of ore weekly with net re, turns averaging about 1000 per car, the Chief one of the largest producers, of the Tintie camp voth iu tonnage, and net earnings, The stopes developed are not suffi, cient to insure a permanent produe, tion of rich ore with such profits as, were made in February but in view, of the fine ore bodies the continuance, of large net earnings may be anticipat, ed, The company has and since or, ganization has had no indebtedness of, any sort except current accounts, which are paid in full each month, Net profits of the company were 13, 929 for 1911 13385 for January and, upwards of 51000 for February 1912, and March earnings should approxi, mate those of February The net, profit of 51000 in February does not, include about 5000 profit to the, Eureka City Mining company control, of which is held by Chief Consolidated, through the ownership of more than, 93 per ceut of the stock issued, Net profits for February 1912 not, including earnings of Eureka City, where at the rate of 10 per cent per, annum on a market value of 7 per, share The company ended 1912 with, a balance on hand of 22230 and, should begin April 1912 with cash, and cash assets the latter consisting, solely of ore that has passed through, the sampler of fully 100000, It is the plan of the management to, accumulate a cash surplus of 200000, to 250000 before beginning the pay, ment of dividends Boston Com, mercial, Lead and Zinc from, Eastern Nevada Mines, The Yellow Pine mill at Good, Springs in Southern Nevada is turn, ing out fifty tons of concentrates a day, according to J B Jensen a Salt Lake, Mining engineer who stopped there, on his return from Mexico That is, ten tons

twenty years activities have been, started on the four Campbell proper, ties Leasing crowds have taken hold, and as there are some of the best prop, erties in the district the output of the, camp should be materially increased, At the Hoosier a fine body of lead ore, has just been opened up It recently, shipped two cars while a third of high, grade lead is being loaded This prop, erty was at one time under lease to, Salt Lake men Herald Republican, India Hoarding Gold, Moreton Frowen M P recently, gave to the London correspondent of, the New York Times an interview on, the question of the great drain of gold, to India which is going on and which, he described as a matter of the very, first importance to America, The position is this said Frewen, The government of India in 1910 im, posed a duty of 8 cents an ounce on all, silver bullion imported into India, The importation of silver previously, for some years averaged 80000000 to, 90000000 ounces annually The result, of the high silver duty seemed to dis, courage importation and the hoarding, of silver by natives and to throw the, whole demand of India for hoarding, purposes upon the other metal fjold, The position is one of great and, growing danger The drain of gold to, India at the present time threatens the, most serious consequences in the mon, ey markets of the western world, Whereas the importation of gold into, India before the new and high silver, duties didnt exceed one year with an, other 4000000 sterling the importa, tion of gold last year into India was, over 20000000 and for the first 11, weeks of this year was at the rate of, nearly a million sovereigns a week, The government at Calcutta has, now applied to the Secretary of State, for India for permission to commence, Mdr - sTf, w, -i, iTerritof lalt LibrarjifMl, JHtnet, NO 31, the coinage in India for permission to, commence the coinage in India of 10, rupee gold pieces thus offering to na, tives through the innumerable bazaars, throughout India a means of hoarding, in the most convenient form Such, mintage would make gold for the pur, poses of hoarding accessible to 300000, 000 of people, Should the government consent to, this proposal the hemorrhage of our, gold to India would further threaten, finance It seems to me of the very, first importance on the part of the, great western financial centers should, be addressed to the government here, The present movement of gold to, India is on such a scale that when the, gold required for arts and manufac, tures has been deducted comparative, ly little of the present immense supply, of gold from the mines is left for, American or European currencies, We shall revert to conditions in the, 80s, Mr Frewen on being asked what, steps it was proposed to take in view, of the serious situation thus forshadow, ed said that probably a deputation, would wait on the Secretary of State, for India during the next few dajs, and it was hoped that Arthur Balfour, would head the deputation Denver, Mining Science, Old York Mines, Being Un watered, Thomas Williams one of the best, known of old time residents of this sec, tion was an arrival yesterday from t e, Old York mines on busness and to e, new acquaintances He says that this, property is being unwatered and bears, an excellent name in mining circles as, a producer of the future of great possi, bilities The Yarnel he states is at, tracting attention and is under devel, opment with a small force pr to a gen, eral resumption taking place whtn, that old property will unquestionable, be the source of a heavy production of, gold Immense bodies of low grade, ores are exposed and the future of that, property is awaited with much inter, est by mining men of that part of the, county Wickenburg Miner, You look

that Mrs Geo, Gillispio returned from the hospital, in Los Angeles when in should have, read Mrs P E Gillispie, Should the legislature fail to em, power the county of Mohave to issue, bonds for courthouse and road work, it will be up to the people to take ad, vantage of the present law and form, the county into road districts and issue, bonds for the building of new roads, and bridges This county is in great, need of roads and the people are anx, ious to bond themselves to get the, means to carry out the good work, A party of Los Angeles men are to, make the trip from Kingman to the, Grand Canyon at Diamond Creek to, look into that part of the canyon with, a view of maKing it one of the scenic, places along the route from the east to, the west The Diamond Creek section, of the Grand Canyon is one of the, grandly beautiful places along that, great gorge It offers greater oppor, tunity for exploration than any of the, scenic points along the rim as at this, point tlio visitor can get right to the, waters edge, Much Interest is centered in the Old, Trail which is popularly supposed to, run across the state of Arizona through, the northern tier of counties Con, gress is to be asked to appropriate, money to build a great highway along, the route and the state will be asked, to contribute largely as the head of, the highway iystem are trying to jug, gle the route to some other direction, to cover their particular section The, orignal route taken by Sitgreaves and, others in their explorations for a trans, continental route to the coast ran, through this county along the line of, the 33th parallel while the old Beale, Trail passes along the same general, route These were the routes followed, in the early days of overland travel, and these are the best routes for high, way in the state, One of the good roads bills just in, troduced in the legislature recites the, fact that the good roads fund of the, state is depleted and therefore It is, necessary that to keep the good work, running a levy of twenty five cents on, the one hundred dollars of taxable, property in the state is necessary to, provide sufficient means for the work, andas it is imperative that the fund, shall be created at once the measure is, saddled with the emergency clause, It does not appear to this legislator, that a levy cannot be made before, next August and that tax collections, will not be coming in before next, November and December wherefore, the emergency clause will avail little, It would appear that the legislature is, working that emergency clause over, time and giving the people an insight, to what this clause in the constitution, may be made to stand for, It will be remembered by many, people that the solemn promise of, every democratic legislator prior to, election ran to the effect that the first, enactment that would be sent to the, governor for his signature would be, the recall of the judiciary measure, Looking back over the forty days of, the session we have been unable to see, any sign of that measure on its way to, the gu bernatorial mansion while all, sorts of measures that should not have, had their being are having their in, ning in both houses Many of the, most important measures affecting the, welfare of the people are still sleeping, in committee and it does not appear, on the surface when they will be cal, led fourth either to pass or to get the, axe One of the representatives from, a small county reports that no, measure effecting the small counties, can get recognition as the big coun, ties have it in mind that the small, counties must be kept down at all, hazards Be that as it may the fact, remains that nothing In the way of, desirable legislation is being carried, through by the fellows in control of, legislation, Wm L Cook Prop the Bee Hive, Drug Store Neihart Mont says the, Belt Cannon running from Belt to Nei, hart is the most picturesque spot in all, Montana He writes I recommend, Foleys Honey

the drilling plant is recoived the, work of drilling the entire vein ex, posure will be commenced, Lew Stlrzel who has been over at, the Ruth mine reports that mining, throughout that section is looking up, Everybody with a prospect is hard at, work developing the property and, many of them are showing up remark, ably well, Tom Brobant and Manuel Ruiz are, making considerable progress in the, work of developing their mining prop, erties near Arastra Well in the, Chemehuevis mountains They have, a fine showing of ore that carries gold, silver and lead, The quiet title action of J J Karlin, against B F Skidmore tried before, Superior Judge Krook last week was, decided in favor of the defendant The, action was brought to quiet title to a, raining claim lying close into the Tom, Reed and which is supposed to have, value on account of its proximity to the, biggest gold producer in the state, Thomas Hogan an owner of the At, lantic and Pacific goup of mines is visit, ing in Kingman Mr Hogan and part, ners J C Potts and L Kimberley, have done a large amount of work on, the properties the past year and have, a good showing of gold ore The prop, erty is situated close to Thumb Butte, south of the Gold Dome properties now, being operated by the Frisco Mines, Power company and consists of a num, ber of claims The mines are well, situated for economic work and the, camp is one of the most ideal in that, section of the district being well sup, plied with spring water and shade, D T Bentley of the Tom Reed Jr, Mining Company passed through King, man yesterday on his way to the mines, He was accompanied by W A Davis, of the Tom Reed Gold Mines company, The company has contracted a large, amount of work on its mining proper, ties having sunk the shaft to a depth, of 160 feet and opening up a splendid, body of gold bearing ore The show, ing is said to be as good as that of the, Tom Reed at the same depth The, company is to continue operations to, still greater depth the present visit to, the mine being with a view to mapping, ut the future work Today a large, number of the directors and sharehold, ers of the company are to go out to the, mines where a meeting will be held, Oro Plata Mine, At the Oro Plata mine work is pro, gressing at every point On the 180, level south a five foot body of ore has, been entered for some distance This, ore is a high grade milling rock On, the same level north the ore body is, two feet wide and runs nearly two, ounces gold to the ton also carrying, some silver This rock will pay to, ship without milling although it would, dress up well over the tables A few, men in these levels are able to keep, the mill bins full of ore while the mill, is kept running continuously and turn, ing out an exceptionally fine product, On the adit level a small streak of ore, was followed off from the main vein, that lead to a body of ore that runs 33, per cent lead and some silver and gold, This is the first time heavy lead ore, has ever been encountered in Oro, Plata ground which leads to the im, pression that the Golconda vein has, been cut The Golconda vein runs, through the ground but so far no ore, of the character of the famous zinc, mine of that district has ever been, found This ore carries zinc some of, it running high in the metal although, the greater value is in the lead The, new find gives promise of proving of, great value the vein having opened to, three feet of solid ore, With the unwattrlng of the lower, level the mine will soon be in position, to make shipments of rich ore aside, from the concentrates the old ore shoot, being capable of producing ore that, runs from eight to twelve ounces gold, to the ton, It Looks Like A Crime to separate a, boy from a box of Bucklens Arnica, Salve His pimples boils

through, the north part of Mohave county last, week and reports great activity, throughout that section, At Beaver Dams one of the greatest, irrigation projects in the state is, ripening into reality The project em, braces the building of a dam at the, Narrows on Virgin river and the em, pounding of the waters of that stream, to a hight of 85 feet the structure, being 255 feet wide at the base and ap, proximately the same width at the top, the canyon having very little flare, The promotors of the project are I C, Torhsen and Wm M OBrien of Salt, Lake City Hugh Wilson of New, York and Harry Jacobs of Salt Lake, City as engineer in charge Torhsen, and OBrien have been working on, the project the past three years and, now claim to have it amply financed, Their option on the site expires soon, so that they have concluded to begin, active work on or before the 15th of, May The dam will be built in the, narrow part of the canyon where the, Virgin river cuts its way through, West mountain of the Virgin range, At this point the cliffs in each side of, the stream rise almost perpendicularly, several hundred feet affording an, ideal spot for a damsite The river, bottom is rocky and reachable with, small expense The dam is to raise, the water high enough to carry it into, the mesa lands along the Virgin the, canals along that stream being carried, down fifteen miles from the head, Laterals are to be carried throughout, the valley and the farmers will be as, sured of ample water right The, canal will be ten feet wide at the bot, tom and fourteen feet wide at the top, and will carry water sufficient to ir, rigate 15000 acres of land This land, along the Virgin is rich in natural, phosphates and is capable of producing, anything that any land in the world, will produce It has been used to, grow cotton on for years besides all, classes of fruits and agricultural pro, ducts By bringing in the mesa lands, the farmers will have a chance to vary, their crops and produce such a, quantity that it will be but a short, time until they will command a rail, road to take the crops to market, The project is estimated to entail an, expense of at least 300000 and the, lands under the project are to be sold, at a price of from 50 per acre up, with a perpetual water right, Another project that will bring, several thousand acres of land into the, marker is that in Canaan Valley, where Lauretzen Rost company is, taking water from the mountain to, Short Creek lake where it will be, empounded for irrigating many thou, sands of acres Already a big flow of, water is running into the lake and a, large number of men are at work rein, forcing the banks of the lake In this, valley there is an immense acreage of, land that can be brought under culti, vation the greater part of which, would be ideal for the growing of, fruits The work of plowing the lands, and preparing it for the crops is well, under way and within the next few, weeks all the seeds will have been, sown, At Wolf Hole lake twenty five, miles south of St George farmers are, taking up lands and sewing grain un, der the dry farming theory Experi, ments have shown that the lands can, be made to produce largely by this, method and with the present year it is, probable that all the lands that are, within easy market conditions will be, taken up Everywhere along that sec, tion of the county men are taking up, lands and it will be but a short time, until all the available lands of the, northern strip will be settled upon, In fact all along the border from, Kanab to Fredonia there is noticeable, activity among the farmers and all are, ready to take up lands for farming, purposes just as soon as surveys are, made and the lands are open to pre, emption and homestead, Dont Know they

machinery the, company intends to drive the adit, drifts into the mountain several hun, dred feet farther and at the same time, will open the vein below the level, The vein is said to be one of the best, so far opened up in the Mineral Park, section and to have great possibilities, of ore production The ore shipped, from the property is said to have had, a yalue of above 200 per ton in gold, and

its mining claims has, been denied by the land department of, the U S government on the grounds, that the property of the company has, not been developed to such an extent, that it is a producing and paying mine, The decision simply means that here, after no titles will pass from the gov, erniuent to the claim holder unless it, can be shown that the property in, question is on a producing and profit, making basis a condition only attain, ed after years of development and the, expenditure of a large amount of, money, This kindergarden and idiotic de, cision by the land department has, stirred mining circles from center to, circumference In our opinion it is, idiocy uncomparable and could only, emenate from government officials, whose state of mentality should be in, vestigated by a board of lunacy and, who have progressed so far in senile, decay as to make them objects of, sympathy if not of ridicule of the, country at large, The mineral bearing lands of any, country are almost universally located, in arid and inhospitable regions and, are valueless for any purpose except, for the precious and baser metals they, contain Before present day crazy, conservation ideas obtained the gov, ernment was anxious that these, mineral fields should be developed so, that the whole country might be bene, fitted by the new and lasting wealth, to be obtained from this source, Liberal laws were in force for the, acquirement of these lands and the, claimholder was encouraged to, develop his holdings in the hope that, a producing minemight be added to, the countrys list of bonanzas and, when a certain amount of work and, money has been expended in mine de, velopment and equipment the claim, owner was entitled to vested right in, his holdings after making the proper, showings This law as far as we know, has never been revoked or changed, There is no valid reason why it should, be no occasion for a deviation from, regular practice in passing upon appli, cation for U S patents and yet be, cause the present administration is, content to fill its various departments, with boobs and incompetents the min, ing men of the country are to be har, rassed and embarrassed by decisions, which will not stand the test of law if, the cases were carried to the courts, If this decision is allowed to stand it, will be a constant menace to the min, ing Industry it will discourage pros, pecting and claim location for if this, is the real attitude of the government, the prospector may hesitate to stake a, claim for fear that some wild eyed and, presumptive department official will, declare the location invalid because, the croppings do not carry 20gold, pieces already coined and the claim, owner will be loth to carry on develop, ment when the wUe ones in Washing, ton are to be the judges of what con, stitutes a promising piece of mining, ground and whether or not it is good, judgement to go further in the search, for payable ore bodies the existence, of which are indicated by the presence, of seams and stringers small surface, values and hurgry croppings, The remarkable ruling of the land, department follows and if it is logical, and sound the majority of the mining, men of the mining regions are merely, fools and lacking in the upper story, The decision according to press dis, patches is as follows, It is evident from the record be, fore the department that the deposits, alleged to have been exposed on these, claims are regarded by the applicant, as possessing practically no economic, value but that on the other hand, title to the claims is sought essential, ly on account of their possible value, for certain unexposed deposits suppos, ed to exist at considerable depth be, neath the surface and having no con, nection so far as shown with any de, posits appearing on the surface, This exposure however of sub, stantially worthless deposits on the, surface of a claim the finding of mere, surface indications of mineral within, its limits the discovery of valuable, mineral deposits outsida the claim or, reductions from established geological, facts relating to it one or all of which, matters may reasonably give rise to a, hope or belief however strong it may, be that a valuable mineral deposit, exists within the claim will neither, MOHAVE COUNTY MINER KINGMAN ARIZONA APRIL 27 1912, suffice as a discovery thereon nor be, entitled to be accepted as the equiva, lent thereof, To constitute a valid discovery up, on a claim for which patent is sought, there must be actually and physically, exposed within the limits thereo a, vein or lode of mineral bearing rock, in place possessing in and of itself a, present or prospective value for min, ing purposes and before patent can, properly be issued or entry allowed, thereon that fact must be shown in, the manner above stated, A Proclamation, By the Governor of Arizona, The Minute book of the Unions, Daily record of events discloses a situ, ation so appalling as to draw from the, President of the United States this ap, peal directed to the Governor of Ari, zona, Conditions of distress resulting, from the flood in the Lower Mississip, pi Valley have assumed such intensity, and

ing the relief camp maintaining, health and restoring the flood refugees, to their homes under conditions which, will enable them to return to normal, conditions of life rests upon the locl, authorities and the Red Cross Many, thousands of people will return to, their homes to find their houses and, furniture and farm equipment and, food supplies for themselves and their, animals almost or wholly destroyed, Questions of health which inevitably, arise from the gathering of great, numbers in camps are already be, coming acute and to these will be ad, ded others even more serious when,

1000 ft lovel in the Centennial-Em, eka mine at Tintic into the, Grand Central it makes it possible now, for a man to enter the old Mammoth, workings a quarter of a mile under, ground and picking his way in a, northerly direction through the dark, passages and along vast stopes big, enough to receive Hotel Utah pass, through Mammoth Grand Central, Centennial Eureka Bullion Beck, Eureka Hill Gemini and probably, other northern extensions of this re, markable ore channel On a straight, line it covers close to two miles but, by following the underground work, ings the distance is probably twice, that far By sauntering around to the, east from Grand Central for about 3, iOO ft the Victoria may be reached, Offshots from the main workings take, one along dark channels into Chief, Consolidated King William Eagle, Blue Bell and perhaps a dozen other, adjoining properties The connection, recently made between the Centennial-Eureka, and Grand Central was, on the latters 2000 ft level All, these groups having thus been connect, ed it is of vast importance in better, ing air conditions Besides this in, case of accident it makes it possible, for the miners to escapo out through, the workings of the neighboring, mines An approximate distance from, the Mammoth main working shaft is, 2000 ft From the Grand Central, haft northward to the Centennial-Eureka, muin shaft is near 3000 ft From, there northward to the Eureka Hill, shaft is 1500 ft and to the Gemini, probably 1000 ft These main shafts, are more than 2000 ft deep The, Grand Central is a little the deepest, having a few

but it is not near coke or, coal or fluxing material he said, But continued Mr Shellwood, there is a great market in the west, for steel and a growing market in the, central w est and the time will come, when it will be practical to ship that, western ore east or to ship from the, east the coke and coal, Several years ago Mr Shellwood, explored the Utah ores for James J, Hill the late John W Gales and the, late E H Harriman They consider, ed those ores a reserve, How long do you think the Utah, ores will be considered merely a re, serveY asked Representative Gard, ner, Probably 25 years, Mr Shellwood thought the time, would come when it would be prac, tical to build steel plates on the Pa, cific coast and told of when Gates and, others had considered erecting a steel, mill at Los Angeles With the com, pletion of the Panama canal the aval, ability of the western ore it is said, would increase, Mr Shellwood said there were de, posits of 55 per cent metalic iron ore, at Moose

ore, above referred to came from a point, only 170 feet from the main shaft of, the Monte Cristo The ore has, identically the same appearance as, ore taken from the Monte Cristo claim, and is certainly from the same vein, The Hidden Treasure is opened up, by means of a tunnel At a point 130, feet from the mouth of the tunnel a, winze 00 feet deep was sunk by parties, working the claim under lease Mr, Bennett was of opinion that in sinking, the winze the lessees had left the pay, streak behind a slip which they mis, took for the wall Following this, hunch he undertook the task of un, watering the winze which he suc, ceeded in doing a few days ago and, on Thursday he shot into a streak of, ore which is twelve inches wide and, Inch may prove to be even wider as, Mr Bennett is not sure that he has, crosscut the entire vein, While the ore carries high value in, silver the gold value is usually, twice as great as that of the silver the, two metals giving a value of from 150, to 2503 per ton while specin en ore, runs into the thousands of dollars per, ton The vein is certainly very rich, at the point just cut the ore showing, large Hakes of native silver, There is a strong probability that, the chute of ore cut in the winze will, prove to be quite a long one as ore, shows in the tunnel above for a dis, tance of 170 feet although the streak, is much narrower than in the winze, Mr Bennett hied back to camp, Thursday night anxious to return to, work to see what the next few shots, will develop Prescott Courier, J H Hayes vice president of tho, Trout Creek Mining Co of
