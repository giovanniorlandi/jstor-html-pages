This was 1\ntaken from 50 tons of ore besides j\nthe concentrates which he values\nat 8500. When asked for a state\nment concerning the property he\nsaid: "There is little to say.\nWe have milled 50 tons of ore\nfrom a Bix-foot vein without sort\ning and have taken out 81000 in\ndust besides the concentrates. We\nhave S 000 tons of the same grade\nore in sight which can be mined\nand milled for less than 82.00 a\nton. I have just ordered live\nmore stamps from \'Frisco and if\nthe strike does not interfere with\ntheir shipment will have them\ndropping within 50 days."\nMr. Brown feels justly proud of\nhis success as he has had to over\ncome many discouraging obstacles\nin getting a mill on the property\nand there jtro many who insisted\nto the Inst that the venture\nwould prove a failure.\nThe Teachers\' Institute\nThe teachers\' institute in session\nin tin* High school building is one\nof the best, and in point of mem-\'\ntiers, the largest ever held in the\ncounty.

A run\nof twenty tons of ore yielded about\n8500 in bullion, which was saved\non the plates, while the value in\nthe concentrates are about as much\nmore. This gives as the average\nof the ore runs through the mill\nabout 830 a ton, and some parts of\nthe mino will yield still better,\nThe camp has often been spoken of\nit HS a base oro \'\' Hn, lb this proves,\nas hue been the result of milling\nthe Big Buffalo ore. that the values\nwhich are fine and saved on the\nplates, are more than sufficient to\npay.

It is un\nderstood that two more stamps\nwill he ordered at once. The\nplant is operated by power from\nDeer cicek, and Mr. Brown states\nthat there is ample power to run\ntwenty stamps. A mining\' man\nwho examined the property recent- :\nly, estimated that on the basis of 1\nthe run made there is over 82,000,-i\n000 in sight now.\nI\nDistinguished Visitors.\nHon. Henry Heitfeld, U. 8 . sen\nator from Idaho, accompanied by\nGeo. H. Storer, ex-state treasurer,\nwere visiting growing Grangeville\nthis week and received cordial\ngreetings from their friends. It was\nMr. Storer\'s first visit to the Cam\nas prairie country, and although\nhe has been a resident of Lewiston\nsince his retirement from office in\nJauuaiy last, he was supriscil to\nfind such a magnificent and exten\nsive country, and swears that if he\nhad known the real truth he would\nhave located here years ago.\nIn conversation with the Free\nPress senator Heithfeld announced\nhimself as an out-and-out demo\ncrat, and stated that he had par\nticipated in the democratic caucus\nin of the senate chamber in company\nwith Fred T. Dubois, on March 4\nlast. Referring to matters peud\ning before the next congress which\nof meets in December the senator\nsaid that the grafters agmld pre\nof sent the same old ship subsidy bill\nin a new form, and that the repub\nlican majorities in both house and\nsenate were large enough to pass it\nover the protests ol the honest re\nto publicans who openly avow that\nthe bill is a cold-blooded steal. The\nof bill is in charge of Mark Hanna,\nwho with other ship owners will be\nj the greatest beueficirics of this\nof latest republican raid on tho treas\nury of the United States.\nas- The Chinese Exclusion Act will\nalso be presented for renewal, but\nMr. Heitfeld says it will never pass\n\' under the present regime. The\nthe pol ey of the republican party is to\nthrow the gates of the United\nI States wide open to Chinese and\na other foreign pauper labor at the\nbehest of the protected m4nufact-| a\nhas urers, in order to cheapen labor on\n■ the one hand, and on the other to\navoid the inconsistency of demand\n1 ing an "open door\'\' in China*\nit\na\n:\nof 1\ntabjJ^JencilSjJc\nU|e_Jto£Jd_Jerad\nI\nI\nPositively No Credit on\nSchool Supplies....\nin\nto\nhe\n4\nit\nbe\nto\nthe\na ^ " p. m. on\non\nto\nLEV^ MAGEE\nProp.

There is, appar\nently, no exception to the rule.\nThe alignment is invariably the\nsame.\nThe reason is plain. The re\npublican parly as organized and\ndirected by Mark Hanna is the\nrich man\'s party. Its control of\ngovernment is in the interest of\nthe rich man. It lias created in\nthis country a multimillionaire\ncaste of trade aristocrats whose\nfortunes- have been amassed\nthrough special privileges granted\nat the sacrifice of the people\'s\nrights.\n.As bet v. een the privileges of this\ncaste and the rights of the work\nman the republican party decides\nevery time in favor of the former.\nIt has no use for a poor man ex\ncept as the beast of burden who\nmakes money for the rich man.\nThe republican leaders know\nthat they have good cause to fear\nthe resentment of organized labor.\nThey can not point to one instance\nin which their party has stood on\nthe side of organized labor as\nagainst the exactions and oppres\nsions of the trusts. The steel\nstrike is logically injurious to the\nrepublican party. It is so because\norganized labor is fighting the\ntrusts in that conllict, and the re\npublican party is the creator and\ndefender of the trusts.\nI\nj\nI\n|\n1\nj\nThe Republican Revolt.\nThere is . more evidence of the\nwidespread revolt against, the re\npublican party due to its abject\nsubmission to the prepatory rich.\nRead this from the Portland, Or.,\nTelegram, the afternoon edition ot\nthe Oregonian: *\nIt may be said that the strike of\n1900 was ev n greater than this.\nNo; it might have been, but Han\nna and Morgan settled it.

They make\nyou pay. pay, pay, in the pretty,\nsupposedly poetical language of\none of their villainous versifiers—\npay, pay. an hundred fold;\nlike the horse-leech,\nThey must\nlast\neral\nand\nin\nO.\nout\npay,\nand then,\nthey are not satisfied,\nbo trillionaircs.\nThis struggle is apparently go\ning against the workingmen.

They don\'t have\nto "fix tilings\'\' any more.\nFt is doubtful if the republicans\ncould find a man of prominence\nwithin their party who is not sold\nand delivered to this greedy, grasp\ning, devouring octopus.\nHut, let a word of warning issue,\nand let the politicians beware The\npeople are going to turn the party\nout of power in 1904 that allows\nlabor to he thus throttled, sand\nbagged, gagged, thrust into tin\nditch and robbed. To the demo\ncratic party millions of wot king\npeople will surge, on account\nthis manifest, iniquity. Because it\nruns into and is necessarily a part\nof polities. No Hanna will stop\nthem now. McKinley is a can\ncelled postage stamp, badly dis\nfigured in the process—in tlieii\neyes. The government has—Knox;\nit had-— fîriggs! Does even Mc\nKinley. the most successful op\nportunity of history, suppose he\ncan keep such trust attorney in his\ncabinet, and at the head of his law\ndepartment, and pacify millions of\ndeceived, deluded and defrauded\nworking men for more than eight\nyears?\nThe American people ate the\nmost inventive, resourceful, self\nreliant, and yet patient people on\nearth; but the time has very near\nly arrived when the few who are\nrobbing the many by the aid of the\ngovernment must beware, and g>-t\nto cover.

We\nreprint the following extract:\n"The geology of the Dixie min\ning district is very simple; the pri\nmary granite and gneiss are the\nprevailing formations with intru\nsive igneous dykes of phonolite,\nporphyry, ryolite and diorite.\nThese dykes appear to have\nplayed a very impôt taut part in i\nthe ore depositation. The strike\nis mainly northerly aud southerly.\nThe pegmatite veins that carry the\nit gold values in most instances strike\nin an easterly and westerly course.\nAt tin* points of intersection and\nfor some distance on either side of\nthe pegmatite veins, rich ore is\nfound, thus proving that the erup\ntive dikes are the principal source\nof mineralization, aud as both these\npegmatite fillings on the east and\nwest fissure veins, and the erup\ntiv e matter in the dikes, are known\nto have come from ihe most pro\nfound depts, it is very certain that\nthe Dixie mining district will be a\nregion of deep mining.\n"In every instance in this camp\nwhere more than superficial sur\nface work has been done, values\nhave been found very uniform,\nwith an increase in depth, and\nespecially so in the proximity of\nthe phonolite dikes. Very little\nbold croppings are to be seen in\nthis district, but the veins denote\ntheir presence by float on the sur\nface, which is usually very close to\nthe apex of its parent ledge,\nveins are very much decomposed,\nfrom oxodized iron principally, and\nthe pegmatite fillings heing soft,\nthey leave a depression ipstead of\na \'cropping, consequently the\ncountry is full of blind ledges,\nthus when the Dixie mining region\nis thoroughly explored, vast bodies\n! of high grade ore will be discover\ned.
