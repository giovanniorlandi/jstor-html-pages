THC DAN JN LOWER TEN, ETC. ,\nBEAUTIFUL ELINOR KING\nSTON AND HER FRIENDS\nFACE EXPOSURE AND\nSERIOUS CONSE\nQUENCES. Synopsis For years old Hilary\nKingston lived with his daugh\nter, Elinor, In u beautiful home\non n hill In the suburban village\nof Woillngliam. Tho neighbors\nknew nothing nbout the estab\nlishment, except that the father\nwas quite wealthy, nnd the\ndaughter very good looking nnd\ngentle. In reality Kingston was\nhead of nn anarchist baud, com\nposed of Huff, Borodny, Talbot\nand Lethbrldge, that robbed the\nrich nnd gave to the poor and\noppressed. One day Old Hilary\nwns shot dead, and the course\nof llfo changed abruptly for his\ndaughter.\nCHAPTER II Continued.\n2\nThe routine never varied. Elinor\nunlocked the door to a winding stnlr\nease, which led to n basement room\nwhere the steel vnult stood In Its ce\nment walls. The five went down, re\nturning shortly with the cash-boxes.\nThe money was divided on tho library\ntable. It went by percentages. Hil\nary drew 20 that last year, each of\nthe others 10 n total of CO per cent.\nTho 40 per cent remaining wns di\nvided, or sent as n whole, according\nto the sense of the meeting. Berlin\ngot It all one year, for Instance, to\nBoroday\'s disgust. Itussla generally\nreceived n largo proportion. Tho Chi\nnese revolution ; the defense of Bcrk\nhardt, who killed Eclrcr tho pork\npacker; n shipment of guns and am\nmunition to Central America thus it\nwent.\nAlthough they preferred only money,\nnow nnd then the loot Included jewels.\nBy common consent, such gems,\nstripped of their settings, were put\nnsldo for Elinor. They meant nothing\nto her. Und anyone told her that for\nseveral years her share had been\ngreater In actual value than all the\nmoney that had fallen to her father\nshe would not have believed It. . . .\nFour days or so after tho annual\nmeeting, the rector of Saint Judo\'s was\nalways asked to dinner. And although\nthn reverend gentleman would under\nnormal circumstances have been fish\ning In Canada, ho never went until this\nfunction was over. For old Hilary, de\ntesting his creed, respected tho man.\nA certain percentage, then, of old Hil\nary\'s shnro went over tho library ta\nble, after the dinner, to the rector.\n"Use it where it will do the most\ngood," ho would say.\n"The church organ "\n"Not n cent to tho church organ.\nBuy the youngsters a playground, or\nbuild n Iylng-ln ward in tho hos\npital." Elinor\'s mother had died in ehlld-\n\' birth.\nThe last check hod been unusually\ngenerous. Tho rector, who had been\nsmoking one of old Hilary\'s choice\ncigars, put It down nnd faced his host\nresolutely. It took courage.\n".Mr. Kingston," ho said, "the church\nneeds men like you. Why bo n Chris\ntian In tho spirit nnd nvold the let\nter?" "Tut." Old Hilary rose and looked\ndown at him. "I mil llko all gamblers.\nThis annual check to your poor Is the\nsop I throw to luck. That\'s all, sir."\nAnd his tone closed the discussion.\nTho word "gambler" worried the rec\ntor. Ho thought over it on his way\ndown the hill to tho rectory. But his\npoor were very poor. Ho cashed the\ncheck the next day. . . .\nElinor was In tho library thnt sunny\nAugust day when they brought old\nHilary to her. Sho had never seen\ndeath before, except on the streets of\nMexico, nnd for a good many years he\nhad been all sho had since her last\ngoverness, In net, had been discovered\nsecreting the rosary and had been\nword-scourged from the house In tenrs.\nSho fainted, and wrinkled Henrietta\nlaid her on n couch.\nBnroday, tho Itusslan, had brought\nthe body home, nnd now he stood, look\ning down nt Elinor nnd strgklng his\nEnglish-cut benrd..\n"Ho expected It, Henrlctte," he said.\n"Ho thought It would havo como soon\ner, In tho Parker matter. I wonder "\nHe glnnced through tho open door to\nthe billiard room, where old Hilary\'s\nbody lay on tho table. Ha wns mludcd,\nwns Borodny, to wonder many things\nwhether, after nil, old Hilary\'s duunt\nless spirit had gone out llko a lump,\nor If\nThis whlto nnd carven thing In the\nnext room, with stiffening hnnds und\ntho gray derby at Its feet, surely there\nwas no mystery nbout It. This was\nnot old Hilary: that was all. But\nwhere, then, was old Hilary? Tho Bus\nrfpn. who had been raised within the\npnle end on nn ancient faith, nnd who\nhad now Inst his best friend, felt all\n\'lie bitterness of his unbelief.\nElinor stirred.\nRLNErtART\n"He will have to be bnrled," said\nHenrietta. "Tho news luiH gone\nthrough the town. Thef nils taut rector\nof the church has telephoned, und Is\non his wny here now. What nm I to\ndo?"\n"Let them bury him ns they will,"\nsnld Borodny. "What does It matter?\nho would himself have seen this humor\nof it."\nHilary Kingston had been shot dur\ning the daylight robbery of tho Agra\nrian bunk messenger. He wns shot as\nan Innocent bystander, nnd wns re\nferred to by tho press ns philanthropist\nand martyr. So much for years of cau\ntion und tho annual gift to Saint\nJude\'s.\nAs n matter of fact, the Agrorlnn nf\nfalr was calamitous In several ways. It\nbore too close a resemblnnce to n St.\nLouis innttor of several years back, In\nwhich Boroduy had come under sus\npicion. On a Tuesday morning, the cash be\ning more than the bank cared to have\nabout, two hundred nnd ten thousand\ndollars wns sent to the clearing house.\nTwo clerks from the bank uccompnnled\ntho messenger, who went by tnxlcnb.\nThere nre two direct routes to the\nclearing house: one along ono of the\ngreat avenues, the other through the\nnewspaper district. Here, at ten-thirty\nIn the morning, things nre rather quiet,\nand except for vans delivering rolls of\npaper, there Is little traffic.\nThe tnxlcab went by this latter route.\nOpposite the Itecord olllce, where the\npresses stood, silent monsters waiting\nto leap, old Hilary Kingston was\nstanding, kldgloved and wearing the\ngray derby hat ho affected. As tho\ntnxlcnb bore down towurd him he\nhulled It.\n"Toxl I" ho called.\nThe tnxlcab slowed down. Old nil\nory, seeing it occupied, waved It off\nwith his stick. But It had como to a\nfull stop. There was nn alleyway be\nside the Itecord building, nnd now three\nmen rati out from there, and thrust re\nvolvers through the open windows of\ntho cnb. After Unit it was hot work.\n"Let Them Bury Him as They Will,"\nSaid Doroday.\nXiiirshnll of the bank went back with n\nbullet through his lung. The bunk\nmessenger fired polntblnnk, and missed\nhis tnrget; but old Hllnry, gray derby\nand nil, went down where ho stood,\ntwenty feet away. The uninjured clerk\nhad nn automatic gun, and swept a\ncircle with It over the bag which lay\nnt his feet. There was no getting In\nside that ring of death. The bandits\nretreated, tiring ns they ran, nnd\nclimbed Into nn automobile up the\nstreet. When the reporters In tho Rec\nord office wakened to tho fact that\nthero was a story under their windows,\nthe street wns clear. Only old Hilary\nlay dead on tho pavement, with a bullet\nIn his head.\nTho chauffeur of tho taxicab drove\ninndly to tho hospital with Marshall,\nwho was djlng, nud then to police\nquarters, where ho gave himself up. He\nwas released, of course. Ills name wns\nWalter Huff. He was shown to bo a\nnew man, but sober and Industrious,\nono of tho best drivers In the employ\nof tho tuxlcnb company. It wns nlso\nshown that Hilary Kingston had hailed\nhint; Huff explained his stopping. Sir.\nKingston wns n regular patron; ho had\nmeant to tell htm thnt In five minutes\nho would como back and pick him up.\nHuff wns under surveillance for\nthree days. Ills conduct wns Impec\ncable. CHAPTER III.\nI"\nIt was, nf ter u\'fl, tho assistant rector\nof Saint Judo\'s who enmo up the hilt\nthat hot August day. Tho news of old\nHilary\'s death hnd como down from\n,tho ctly on un early train. Tho rector\nwas away on his deferred fishing trip,\nwhere, having exchanged his clerical\ncollar or none at all and having blls-\n\'! Hi\ntered tho end of his ecclesiastical nosa\nhe was quite happy.\nThe asslstunt, Mr. Ward, whistled an\nhe climbed the hill. As the hill was\nRtecp, this proved two things his\nyouth, nnd Ids lightness of henrt. True,\nold Hilary Kingston was dead, and vio\nlently done to death. But to Mr. Ward\ndeath was but the gateway to a larger\nlife; and only very sad In the young,\nwho have not yet lived. \'\nMr. Ward was young, a broad-shouldered\nyoung man, with clear, rather\ndeep-set eyes, and n firm mouth, Tho\npeople of Snlnt Jude\'s prophesied that\nthe world would hear of Mr. Ward.\nThere was only one bnr to his progress :\nho had too much humor. It seemed to\nthe people of .Saint Judo\'s thnt religion\nIs a serious thins, forgetting that good\ncheer Is one of tho things It must bring,\nnnd it be religion.\nllorodny met Ward In the hall. Old\nHilary was upstairs by that time, lying\nIn his great bed. All tho doors nnd\nwindows were open, and sunshine, filled\nthe rooms. Ward thought It an un\nusually sune house of mourning.\n"I\'m glad to see tho sun," ho said.\n"So many people close things up."\n"Miss Kingston wished things undis\nturbed." "I came to tell her hut I suppose)\nshe doesn\'t care to see anyone tho\nrector Is away on a holiday. I\'ll wlro\nhim, of course."\nIlorodny led the way Into the library\nwhere the rector had so recently re\nceived his check. He turned rind eyed\nWard.\n"Why bring tho rector hack?" ho\nnsked. "It Is n little late for tho\ncomforts of religion."\n"Mr. Kingston gave lavishly to tho\nchurch. "Whatever the church can\ndo "\n"I rather think," said Boroday po\nlitely, "that he gave, not to the church,\nbut to the poor."\n"\'Inasmuch ns ye give unto ono of\nthe least of these," Ward replied,\nand returned Boroday\'s gaze.\nminor had pulled herself together.\nBy tho one standard that had ruled\nher llfo she acted now her father\'s\nwishes.\nWard, brought face to face with her,\nfound her unapproachable, calm, al\nmost cold. Found her very lovely; too,\nnnd let his nrdent young eyes rest on\nher oftcnor than was wise. Her sit\nuation appealed to hm. She seemed\nto bo quite nlonc, save for tho Itusslan\nwith the benrd.\n"If I con do anything," ho snld,\n"wlro to your rclntlves anything of\nthat sort"\n"I have no relatives. My mother\ndied when 1 was born. I I have n\ncurious feeling that everything in the\nworld has stopped as though I\'d\nreached tho end of things."\nIt seemed to Mr. Word that he\nshould offer some of the comfort of his\nfaith to this shrinking, wide-eyed girl\nbefore him. But what? Rumors had\ncomo to him, of course.\n"Death Is only a tragedy when wo\nthink of It as nn end and not as u be\nginning," ho said. "It is always sad.\nI hope you understand that I know\nhow terrible nil this Is for you. But\nto have lived one\'s life, nctlvo und\nwell and useful to the end, nnd then\nto depart, in tho fullness of days, for\nnew activities somewhere else "\nElinor shivered In the warm sun\nshine. "You see," she said drearily, "I do\nnot believe those things. I should like\nto Just now." Then, almost defiantly:\n"He wns useful. Tou will never know\ntho things ho did that were helpful.\nBut perhaps we would not agree on\nthat, either."\nThe Husslan wns walking up and\ndown the hall, Impassive, watchful.\nUnder his stoical Indifference, he was\nsuffering tortures. A bullet from tho\nautomatic hud gone through his left\narm. grazing the bone. Luckily, tho\nbullet was not In the wound. Henrl\netto had bathed and cleansed It, but\nhe was In agony. Ho was sufferlns\npain, bereavement, defeat. Ills face\nexpressed only decorous nnd conven\ntional regret.\nNow and then he glnnced In nt tho\nlibrary door, but generally he watched\nthe road up the hill. As he had\nwatched the Church ascending, so now\nnt any tlmo might como Law. Ho\nwould bo prepared.\nHe had grown a heard since the St.\nLouis matter. That would help. And\nhe hud waited to return and claim old\nHilary\'s body, until the Itecord extra\nhad announced his killing. Walking\nup and down the wido hall, his keen\nmind wns going back, detail by detail,\nover the day. Talbot nnd Lethbrldge\nIn tho car had kept on.

Early plowing\nburies the hessian 11 v, consents\nmoisture and makes a good\nseedbed for wheat.\nFor best results plow or disc\nas soon as possible after har\nvest. Discing nnd then plowing\nis often advisable because disc\ning will make the plowing mucli\neasier, conserve moisture, and\nthe ground will seldom become\ntoo hard in plow, niscintr also\ndestroys tho hessian fly nnd ex\nposes tho ilaxsed stage of tho\npest to the hot sun and the nt-\ntack of insect enemies.\nThe plowed ground should be\ncultivated after rains to keen\ndown volunteer wheat and\nweeds. If tho volunteer wheat\nis destroyed tho hessian lly will\nbo starved because its main food\nplant is wheat. The cultivation\nof the plowed ground also helps\nto conserve moisture nnd umbo\na better seedbed for wheat.\nA united effort on the part of\ntho farmers to control the hes\nsian lly is very important this\nyear, according to T. J. Talbert\nof tho University of Missouri\nCollege of Agriculture. The\npest is well under cantrol now\nns a result of last year\'s fight\nagainst it, and if the farmers\ntake special pains to plow under\ninfested wheat stubble and de\nstroy all volunteer wheat the lly\nwill be unable to do any material\ndamage to next year\'s wheat\ncrop.\nWeeds and Water Enemies of Roads.\nEveryone) knows thnt wntor is de\nstructive of good roads. After rains,\ncountry roads are usually in bad con\ndition, nnd then U the time Tor the\nfarmer to "do bis bit" nnd show his\npatriotism by repairing such damage\nand preventing further loss. This\nmay he done in two ways: First, by\nopening up side ditches and connect\ning tho ruts with these ditches so that\nshowers will ho promptly carried off:\nSecond, by cutting the weeds and\nbrush between fences to let the sun\nshine dry up the pools that do not\ndrain. On clay ronds n smnll amount\nof work expended in eliminating ruts\nat the time the roail is lipi-innim- t,.\ndry up will place it in good condition.\nEvery farmer should feel a ner.-oiial\nresponsibility Tor tho stretch of road\nin fiout of his own farm, and should\nexert himself to do what ho omi tn\nI keen it i\'j nroner condition !. t.nv..l\nWeeds growing in the highway will\nscatter their seeds over his field, and\nhi- cannot avoid responsibility for this\nneglect simply because they grew nut\nhide his fence lines.
