The charge,\nwas filed after the return, Sun\n^av, Sheriff W. H. Eller,\nwho was at Wind river inves\ntigating the Idling. Prelimi\nnary hearing for McMeeken is\nset for next Tuesday before,\nProbate Judge Campbell. Mc\nMeeke is represented by Atty.\nM. R. Haltaliaugh.\nSHOT EN BACK OF HEAD\nWhite was shot three times, accord\ning to the verdict of the coroner\'s\njury, which conducted an inquest over\nthe body of White, on Thursday last.\nHe was shot once in the back of the\nbead, another time in the breast, and\nanother shot bit his right shoulder.\nFollowing is the verdict of the cor\noner\'s jury:\nWe, the coroner \'s jury, sum\nmoned by the sheriff of Idaho coun\nty, Idaho, find that Charlie White,\ndeceased, came to his death by\nthree gunshot wounds fired by Neal\nMcMeeken, one shot penetrating\ntbo breast, going straight in, one\nhitting tho point of the right\nranging downward,\none shot penetrating the back of\nthe bead, going straight through\nto the skull bone in front, lodging\ninside the skull bone over the left\neye.\nRAY PABiaOT,\nCHARLES SCOTT,\nA. C. BISHOP,\nJ. L. CHAMBERLAIN,\nBOB HILAND3,\nTHOMAS C. HAYWARD.\nThe inquest was conducted by Sheriff\nEller, who was deputized by Coroner\nMaugg to summon a jury. The coroner,\nwhile enroute with the sheriff to Wind\nriver, was summoned to Fiddle creek\nto investigate the death of Dr. W. F.\nPogue, and it was decided then that\nthe coroner would not proceed to Wind\nriver.\n/\n38 CAUSER COLT USED\nWhite was shot by a 38 caliber Colt\nspecial, double action revolver, accord\ning to Sheriff Eller, who is in possess\nion of the gun.\nThe sheriff\'s investigation revealed\nthat White had sold to MeMeekon a\nmining claim and house and contents,\nat the mouth of Wind river. The sale\ntook place a few weeks before the\nkilling. White, who had been at the\nplace, was supposed to leave on the day\nhe was shot. A quarrel between White\nand McMeeken arose over a crockery jar\nand ended in the killing of White.\nWhether McMeeken shot in self-de\nfense, as claimed, the authorities are\nunable to decide. The fact that one of\nthe bullets penetrated the back of\nWhite\'s head is declared by some to\nconstitute evidence against McMeeken.\nWhite\'s hat, through which the bullet\npassed, is held as an exhibit.\nImmediately McMeeken\nWhite, be went to the ranch of his bro\nther, Sam McMeeken, two and a half\nmiles up Wind river. There he met his\nbrother and Bob Hilands, whom be in\nformed of the shooting, and asked them\nto go to the cabin and see what condi\ntion White was in.\n\\\nAFRAID OF WHITE\nNeil McMeeken, it is said, refused to\nreturn with the men to the cabin, for\nhe is quoted as saying he did not know\nwhether White was dead, and if he\nwere not dead he felt White would\nshoot him.\nSam MeMeeken and Hilands went to\nthe cabin, where they found White\'s\ndead body.\nOwing to the hot weather in the can\nyon. the body of White soon began to\nshow signs of decomposition, and it\nwas removed to a place beneath a shade\nfree, on the bank of the river, where it\nwas covered by a tent.

They were assassinated by fan\natics, if you please, and organized vio\nlence did not enter into the killings.\nIn sliarj» contrast to the motives\nprompting the assassins of our martyr\ned presidents, are those surrounding\norganized dynamiting, which within the\nlast few- years, has become a matter of\nmore or less frequent recurrence in the\nUnited States.

W.\nBrooks, traffic superintendent for the\nWestern Union Telegraph Oo., at Dallas,\nTex., and living at 1782 Hickory\nstreet, that city.\n"When 1 began taking Tanlac,\'\'\ncontinued, " 1 was suffering from a stub\nborn case of stomach trouble, the re\nsult of an attack of acute indigestion I\nhad several years ago. I had an awful\npain across my back, and was so ner\nvous and worried about my kidneys\nthat I could hardly sleep at all. I suf\nfered from rheumatism in my legs, my\nfeet would swell and 1 was tired and\nlanguid all the time. 1 was badly run\ndown, lost weight, strength and energy\nand none of those medicines I took did\nmo a bit of good.\n"After using Tanlac for a short time\n1 began to pick up and kept improving\ntill now my rheumatism is all gone, the\npains have disappeared from my back\nand my kidneys don\'t worry nie like\nthey did. I have a fine appetite and\ncan eat anything I want without suf\nfering at all from indigestion, my sleep\nis sound and restful and I get up in\nthe morning feeling fine."\nTanlac is sold in Q-rangeville by\nGlanville Drug Co., in Cottonwood by\nTurner Drug Store, and in Warron by\nWarren Supply Co.\nin v\nho\n(Adv.)\nWHITEBIRD\n<S>\n<»\nClaude White, Lueile, Idaho.\nJohnie Johnston, of Lueile, Idaho.\nAlfred S.
