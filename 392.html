Sometimes the whole\nI bird was covered wllh gold leaf and a |\nstrip of cotton, saturated with spirit, I\nset alight In Its beak—a relic possibly, j\n■ with the English snapdragon and\nblazin\' Muddlng, of the lire worship of\nI pagan days.

Some years j\nago a Boston w< man with a touch of\nimliquarlnn spirit managed to stimu\nlate Huston to revive a pretty Yule\ntide rustoin by celebrating its coming\nI by singing carols in ibe streets and by\nilluminating the bouses through tbe\ni placing of candles In the window*.\n| Other cities emulated Boston In this\nmatter. In Carlisle. Pa., a community\nChristmas tree was lighted In Hie pub\nlic square, and Us glowing joy was\ncontimi"d all along the streets by light\ned candles placed In the windows,\nj many of which showed In the middle\n! of the rooms so lighted up, displayed\n| to the passers!),v la Hie night, private\nChristinas trees, Ihe glitter and beauty i\nof which thus were shared wllh all.\nAn objection to this attempt at glad- j\nness—at least so far as concerns the\nI Use of candles—has been Ihe risk of\nj fire, But these days of electricity op\nj even of gas seem to minimize the idea\n! of danger, and there are different do* j\nVices that may he applied to do aWny\nwith all risk In the carrying out of\nthe friendly suggestion. It Is advised\n; therefore that "Hm gladness and\nbrightness of (he home on Christmas\n■ eve be not kept behind closed blinds,”\nj and to that end It Is suggested that the\nlight from every window, whatever Its\ni nature, he permitted to shine Into tho\n| streets until midnight.

The\nTimes has been confident from the\nfirst that as he campaigned the\ndistrict and met with the people\nhis worth would be promptly and\nuniversally recognized and his\npopularity here would rapidly\nspread over the uine counties of\nthe district, and this is being con\nclusively manifested by the report\nthat are coming back to us through\nthe press.\nEvery citizen of Oktibbeha\nshould share the pride which we\nfeel over the excellent race that\nMr. Magruder is mukiug for con\ngress.\nGov.

When these great heads of scarlet\nleaves are fully grown they will re\ntcnln In this condition from ten to\n1* live weeks. The poinsettia Is very\neimlly cultivated. It grows In any\ngood sandy soil and delights In a warm\ni-imosphere.\nThe flowers w|l! be much larger and\nflier If the plant Is given a little stim\nulation In the form of liquid manura\nfor n few weeks previous to Its bloom\ning. After It has stopped flowering—\nabout the middle of February—lt should\nbe dried off and turned on Its side In\na warm place until May. The cellar Is\nsuitable If there Is n furnnee; If not,\nselect an upstairs closet. The plant\nwill become Just like a dried stick,\nlAit will be alive nevertheless. When\nfine spring weather comes put the pot\noutside snd water It well. It’s surpris\ning how quickly It will start to grow,\nbut before It has made much growth\ncut It back to the stump. Nest shake\noff about two-thirds of the old soil, re\nplacing It with fresh sol) composed of\ngood garden loam and sand. When cut\nthe number of shoots will Increase, and\neach shoot means a head of bloom.\nImmediately after the blooming sea\nson Is the proper time to propagate\npoinsettia, which anyone can cosily\ndo. After cutting the plant back to\nthe stump and allowing It to rest as\nfirst described take the canes or\nbranches which have first been remov\ned and cut them In lengths of about\nsis Inches. Be careful In making the\ncuttings to keep the tops all one way\nas they nre now only dry stems. Fill\na four or five-inch flowerpot with loose\nsand nml stick the cuttings In this (bot\ntom down) to the depth of about two\nInches. After the cuttings are In place\ntup the bottom of the pot on the table\nsharply several times to settle the\nsand. Now voter thoroughly and place\nIn a sunny window. Afterward water\nslightly, Jnst enough to keep the" sand\ndump. The cuttings will soon begin to\nshow signs of growth. When sure\nthnt they are rooted (which should take\nabout six weeks) transplant them Into\nsepnrate pots, using the soil first men\ntioned. They will grow In these pot*\nduring the following summer.
