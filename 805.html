The\nblessings of civil liberty which now\nseem on tho threshold of general rec\nognition and extensive realization\nthroughout tho world, wero first ex\nperienced in a largo and general way\nby tho people of our own country. In\nno other country, either of present or\npast times, has there been so general\nan understanding or enjoyment of the\nadvantages of free government, or\ngreater sacrines made to secure and\nmaintain them, than in our own.\nThe great events of our history, and\ntho heroic cxamplo of tho men whose\nnames are associated with the achiev\ning of our national independence, or\nwith tho preservation of our national\nintegrity, aro all brought vividly to\ntho mind upon an occasion liko the\npresent, naturally and powerfully\narousing the patriotic sentiments of\nthe citizen.\nOn this occasion commemorating an\novent so important as the. establish\nment of representative government in\nthis State the\' form of eovernment\nwhich we havo come to regard as the\nonly form worthy of free men it\nseems to mo fitting and appropriate to\ndiscuss briefly tho ideas underlying\nour representative system of govern\nment, the manner of its introduction\nin our commonwealth, some of the\nfundamental principles announced in\nout Stato Constitution, and tho gradual\nextension or evolution of our system\nof laws which has resulted from the\napplication of our constitutional prin\nciples to tho changing conditions of\nour industrial and political life.\nThe idea of eovernment which may\nbo said to be distinctively American\nis that of a political organization\nwhich is in its nature an agency of\ndelegated and limited powers suscep\ntible to adaptation by expansion or\ncurtailment within constitutional limi\ntations, where necessary, according to\nthe ebb and flow of public opinion.\nTho powers of a government liko ours\nare all derivative, and the origin or\nsource from which they are derived is\ntho will or consent of tho people; or,\nto quote our Declaration of Independ\nence, "All governments derive their\njust powers from tho eonsent of the\ngoverned."\nThe theory of the natural rights of\nman and its corollary, tho derivative\nnature of tho powers of government,\ndid not have its origin In this country.\nit had been developed through cen\nturies of Greek, Bbman arid modern\nEuropean history; but these Ideas were\nfirst combined In a fundamental in\nstrument of government In the Ameri\ncan eonstftulioas of the revolutionary\nperiod, and have- ever since been "in\ncorporated as a part of our State c6n\nstitutions.

In 1798, this terri\ntory passed to tho second stage of ter\nritorial eovernment. under whicb for\ntho first time Illinois elected represen\ntatives to the lower house of the ter\nritorial legislature, but on a restricted\nfranchise which required every voter\nto possess a freehold of fifty acres of\nland, while higher qualifications woto\nrequired for members of the legisla\nture. In 1800, Hlinois was transferred to\nthe new territory of Indiana; and for\ntho next five years this territory was\nunder "the first stage of territorial gov\nernment with no elected legislature.\nIn 1805, a territorial legislature was\nprovided for Indiana, to which Illinois\nelected members, under the same re\nstricted suffrage as before.\nIn 1809, the territory of BKnois was\nesfablishe3; and for tho first thrfe\nyears was governed without a -representative\nlegislature.

Norman B. Barr.\n"No woman "who dresses modestly\nand carries herself in a modest man\nner need fear being annoyed by \'mash\ners\' on the streets," -was the statement\nmade by the Bev. Norman B. Barr, pas-\ntor of the Olivet Memorial church,\nPenn and Tedder streets, in an ad\ndress at the -weekly meeting of the\nPresbyterian Ministers\' association in\nthe Ohio Building Monday.\n"The average \'masher\' will not ap\nproach a woman on the street unless\nhe receives some encouragement, either\nfrom her extreme manner of dressing\nor from her actions, such as loud talk\ning or laughing or tho bold manner in\nwhich she looks at persons on the\nstreets," continued the pastor. "In\nthe cases which have come under my\nobservation, such has invariably been\nthe cause of the woman being ap\nproached. "If women could bo induced to\nabandon the present-day fashions I be\nlieve the \'mashers\' would become a\nthing of the past. Twenty-five years\nage a woman being accosted on the\nstreets was an unheard of occurrence.\n"Nowadays women are becoming ac\ntive in every line of endeavor and aro\nbecoming less modest than formerly.\nNo woman who wears a dress which\nexhibits every lino of her figure can\nbe called a modest woman."\nBev. Barr has boldly stated, the ab\nsolute truth, in relation, to the bold\nness of women in all things. In our\nboyhood days, the lady in old Vir\nginia who was highly cultured in every\nrespect, and represented the highest\ntype, of Anglo-Saxon womanhood, who\nhad charge of our early training\ntaught ns, to look upon women, as puri-\n, fied . Angels, \'and that idea was so\nthoroughly instilled in our mind at an\nearly age, that it was horrifying to\nus, after coming North, to see women,\nor ladies if you please, conducting\nthemselves, in a manner entirely un\nbecoming to those who claim to be de\ncent and respectable.\nIt is needless to say, that it caused\nour eyes to open wide in wonderment\nwhen we first landed in Philadelphia,\nPa. and in other large Northern cities,\nand finally in Chicago, to see women\nboth "White and Colored, who move\nin the upper society, rushing in and\nout, of the"Tront doors of saloons and\nsome, of them standing up to the bar\ndrinking as boldly as the men, smok\ning cigars,, cigarettes, using vile or\nbad language, and staggering np and\ndown the streets, just like drunken\nmen.\nWomen who conducted themselves in\nthis manner, only a few years ago,\nwere eternally and forever disgraced.\nNow they are highly honored and con\nsidered to be real smart, if they can\ndrink 20 or 30 highballs or Manhattan\nCocktails at one sitting and otherwise\ndebauch themselves in general.\nNo? so many years ago, -the ladies\nwould retire to their bedrooms, when\nthey desired to powder their faces and\narrange or re-arrange their toilets.\nNow it is so uncommon thing or sight\nto observe them painting or powder\ning np their faces while strolling and\nflirting on the downtown streets of\nChicago.\nThe present modern woman and her\nstyle of dress is frightful to behold.\nShe wOl persist, in stuffing herself into\ndresses which are about four times too\nsmall, and if she would walk on all\nfours like our former ancestors, she\nwould resemble some of the fat or stout\ncows and other animals.\nMenwith their eyes and ears wide\nopen possessing one ounce of brains\ncannot entertain the highest respect\nfor the swaggering and staggering\nmodern woman.\nMr. and Mrs- Henry Jones, 6641\nBrans avenue; returned\' home Friday\nevening from Watseka, Illinois.; the\nformer home of Mrs. Jones.

CHARLES a DENEEN\'S\nADDRESS.\nConcluded from Page 1.\nstrange to say, has been omitted from\nthe later compilations of the Statutes\nof Illinois. Yet this Act may well be\nconsidered as the fundamental char\nter of the new government established\nin Illinois in 1812.\nBy the terms of this Act, tho right\nto vote was granted to all free white\nmales twenty-one years of age, who\nhad paid a county or territorial tax,\nno matter how small, and had resided\nin the territory one year. This Act\nalso provided that not only the mem\nbers of the Lower House but also the\nfive councilors should be directly elect\ned in five districts instead of being\nnominated by the representative body.\nThirdly, the delegate to Congress was\nto be directly elected by the people,\ninstead of by the legislature.\nOne hundred years ago last Satur\nday (September 14, 1812) Governor\nEdwards issued two proclamations pro\nviding for two of tho events wo are\nnow celebrating. Ono of them estab\nlished three new counties; Madison,\nGallatin and Johnson, which, with the\ntwo former counties of St. Clair and\nRandolph, formed tho fivo districts for\neleetine the members of the councu.\nTho other ordered an election to be\nheld October 8-10 for delegates to Con\ngress, members of the council and rep\nresentatives. At the election, Shadrach Bond was\nelected as the first delegate to Con\ngress from tho territory of Illinois and\ntook his seat December 2d. The first\ncouncil consisted of Pierre Menard of\nRandolph, president; Benjamin Talbot\nof Gallatin, William Biggs of St. Clair,\nSamuel Judy of Madison and Thomas\nFerguson of Johnson. In the House of\nRepresentatives, Randolph county was\nrepresented by George Fisher (who\nwas Speaker); Gallatin, by Alexander\nWilson and Phillip Trammel; Johnson,\nby John Grammer; St. Clair, by Joshua\nOglesby and Jacob Short; and Madison,\nby William Jones.\nThe first Legislature of Dlinois Ter\nritory met at Kaskaskia on November\n12, 1812. The session lasted ono day\nover a month, and the principal law\nenacted was one continuing in force\ntho laws previously enacted by the\nGovernor and judges, and such of the\nStatutes of Indiana Territory as were\nnot local in character or had not been\nrepealed. Some of these had been\nlaws of the Northwest Territory which\nhad been re-enacted by each successive\ngovernment.\nA second session of the first legisla\nture was held in 1813; and there were\ntwo other territorial legislatures, 1814-\n16, and 1816-1S, which- held two short\nsessions each. Then Illinois was ad\nmitted as-a State, and tho territorial\nlegislature was succeeded by the first\nGeneral Assembly of the State.\nIt may be of interest here to relate\nthe fact that in the year 1812 my\ngreat-grandfather, Risdon Moore, the\nfirst of our family to settle in Illinois,\ncame from Georgia and settled in the\nneighboring county of St. Clair, about\nfour miles east of Belleville. He was\nvery active in the political life of the\ntimes and was elected to the territorial\nlegislature for the two sessions of 1814\nand 1816 and was chosen speaker for\nthe term. Ho was also a representa\ntive from St. Clair county to the first,\nsecond and third General Assemblies\nafter the admission of Illinois to the\nUnion. In the great struggle over the\nslavery question in 1823 and 1824 he\nwas a pronounced anti-slavery advo\ncate and incurred tho enmity of the\npro-Blavery party to such a degree that\nhe was burned by them in effigy at\nTroy, this county.\nSince the- establishment of the terri\ntorial legislature of Illinois in 1812,\nthe people of Illinois have never been\nwithout representative government.\nWe are therefore celebrating today the\ncompletion of one hundred years of\ncontinuous Self-government, based on\npopular suffrage. Even the slight re\nstrictions of the Act of 1812 were re\nmoved when the first State Constitu\ntion of 1818 went into effect.\'\nThe provisions of our Constitution of\n1818 are the same, in general, as thoso\nof the other State constitutions; though\nsome of the provisions in the bills of\nrights of the other\' state constitutions\nwere omitted. For example There is\nno positive declaration in the first Illi\nnois Bill of Bights against slavery,\nsuch as is found in the Ohio constitu\ntion. There is no declaration of the\nright of the citizen to bear arms.

Not only are we in\ndebted to him for his services in this\nconnection but also for tho fact that\nthe northern boundary of our State\nwas\' fixed at its present position.\nWhile the bill for an Act. to enable\nHlinois to organize as a State was\npending before Congress, it was so\namended, upon motion of Nathaniel\nPope, as to establish the northern\nboundary of tho now State sjxty-ono\nmiles north of the boundary fixed by\ntho ordinance of 1787, which had\nplaced it at a lino parallel with tho\nsouthern extremity of Lake Michigan.\nmi.:. f..Tiion of our territory gave\nto Hlinois a port upon Lake Michigan\nand in tho course of events has given\nus at Chicago not only tho greatest\nof lako ports but tho greatest city of\nth interior and the greatest railroad\ncenter in tho world.\nThe chief object which Nathaniel\nPope had in view in securing xor\nIlli\nnois a position upon tho Great Lakes\nwas tho uniting of our political\n- :n, hna of tho eastern\nfor\nand\nthe\nlot\nthe\nthe\nnorthern states instead of with\nsouthern states, thus casting our\nin. i. nT,ti.1ftverv states and, in\nevent of civil disturbance . over\ni nnMiinn. maJtinc our omie\nas\nho foresaw, the keystone to the per\npetuity of tho Union.\nThis was one of tho most important\nInstances of the wiso adaptation of\nour laws and their territorial 3unsdic\ntion to our political conditions as fore\nseen by one of tho most far-sighted\nof our earlv statesmen. As we all\nknow now, Illinois did become, both\nin the stugglo of opinion which pre\nceded tho Civil "War and in tho Civil\nWar itself, tho keystone to the per\n.: f th Union.

Our natural resources merely\nawaited tho discoverer. Onr builded\nproperties represent time and. money\nand energy and every ono -of theso\nbuildings destroyed through tho agency\nof the red plague of fire is an irretriev\nable loss to the community at large.\nBetween 1901 and 1910 tho per\ncapita loss through firo in tho United\nStates was $2.71 as compared to the\ntotal European per capita loss during\ntho samo period of thirty-three cents\nand tho German per capita loss of\nnineteen cents. Between 1900 and\n1910 tho population of the United\nStates increased scventy-threo per\ncent while tho firo loss increased 134\nper cent. Hlinois and her citizens suf\nfered a loss of property by fire last\nyear of approximately $11,000,000.\nThis loss increased tho burden of taxa\ntion directly to the property owners\nwho insure and, indirectly to tho peo\nple at large in tho loss of taxes on\ntho property burned. It was a tre\nmendous drain upon the resources of\nour State. In contrasting tho condi\ntions in Continental Europe, with their\nlaws regulating tho construction and\nprotection of building and the general\nwork of fire prevention, with tho con\nditions in this country it appears that\nfifty per cent of tho firo waste in Hli\nnois and tho nation is preventable.\nThis Five and One-half Million Dol\nlars should bo saved to tho people of\nthis State by arousing tho public mind\ninto action in a concerted effort to\nminimize the causes of carelessness,\nignorance and arson which have\nbrought about prevailing conditions\nwithin our State.\nGreater oven than tho loss of prop\nerty is tho tremendous loss of life\nthrough tho agency of fire. More than\nfivo thousand lives were lost, accord\ning to the statistics, by fire last year\nin tho United States and Canada. Tho\ncitizenship of our State should unite\nto conservo tho property of our people\nas wo conserve the health and-lives of\nthe peoplo of this State.\nTo this end, therefore, it is most\nearnestly recommended that Wednes\nday tho\nNINTH DAY OF OCTOBER, 1912,\nwhich is the forty-first anniversary of\nthe great Chicago fire, bo set aside and\nbe known throughout tho State of Hli\nnois as\nFIRE PREVENTIONxDAY,\nthat on said day all owners of prop\nerty shall take steps to see that their\nbuildings be thoroughly inspected for\nthe purpose of discovery and removal\nof dangerous conditions therein; that\ntho civic authorities concerned in the\nprevention of fires take steps to call\nthe attention of tho peoplo of their\ncommunity to tho common fire dan\ngers and co-operato with them in every\npossible way in correcting dangerous\nconditions and that our school authori\nties, both public and private, shall on\nthe above day conduct such appro\npriate exercises as will impress upon\nthe pupils of our schools the danger\nof fire and the methods of its preven\ntion ahd, that in every, school in this\nState a fire drill shall that day be in\naugurated and that these fire drills be\nmado a permanent feature and prac\nticed at frequent intervals through the\nschool year.\nIn testimony whereof I have here\nunto subscribed my name and caused\nthe great seal of the State of Hlinois\nto be affixed at the Capitol in tho City\nof Springfield, this Thirtieth day of\nAugust, A. D. 1912. .\nCHARLES S. DENEEN,\nGovernor.\nBy the Governor:\nC. J. DOYLE, Secretary of State.\nHEALTH NOTES.\nHealth habits make healthy people.\nFresh air is iiee. Why not have it\naU the timeT \'\nThe home may be only a humble cot\ntage on a very small lot, but it can\nbe kept as dean and its surroundings\nas tidy, as the more pretentious house\nand yard costing ten times the money.\nIn other words people do not have to\nbe rich to be dean, healthy and happy.\nHere is a good way to keep sick:\nNever open the windows in Ton? sleep\ning chamber. See that\' they are eare-\nxuuy uosea at nignt and the room\nmade as dose and stuffy as possible.\nKeep out of the sunshina and be care\nful not to take lonsr \'"on- breaths.\nEat any land of food nt iledt of its\nnutritive value and be a, .regular as\nyou can as to the time of taking your\nmeals. Also eat hurriedly; no use\nwasting time over a. matter of this\nkind. Wear an overcoat one day and\ngo without it the next in winter\nEuj(\nweather and change \'from heavy to\nlight underwear any old time. Don\'t\nbathe oftener than once a month and\nnever take exercise in tho open air\nwhen you can play cards or biUiards\nin a room filled with foul air and to\nbacco smoke. By foUowing these few\nsimple directions you wiU befriend the\ndoctor and if they are rigidly followed,\nthe undertaker wiU also havo a chance\nto mako a dollar.\nCan you think of anything more ab\nsurd than this fact that not one per\nson in every hundred gets his rightful\nsupply of good, fresh airf This means\nthat most of us do not get enougn\ngood air to keep ns strong and vigor\nous and to enable us to ward off dis\nease. And most absurd of all is tho\nfact that people are themselves to\nblame for not getting at all times their\nsharo of fresh air. In most cases peo\nplo work and sleep in bad air because\nthey will not open doors and windows\nand thus help to make their indoor sur\nroundings moro liko those they would\nhavo when working or living out of\ndoors. \'\nOPEN ATR SCHOOLS SHOW BAPID\nGROWTH.\nIncrease from 1 to 200 in five years\nTuberculosis Causes Million Dollar\nEducational loss.\nWith tho opening of tho fall school\nterm, over 200 open air schools and\nfresh air classes for tuberculous, and\nanaemic children, and also for all chil\ndren in certain rooms and grades, will\nbo in operation in various parts of tho\nUnited States, according to a state\nment published to-day by Tho National\nAssociation for tho Study and Preven\ntion of Tuberculosis.\nAll of theso schools, tho association\nsays, havo been established since Janu\nary, 1907, when tho firs$ institution of\nthis character was opened in Provi\ndence, E. I. On January 1st, 1910,\nthere were only 13 open air schools\nin this country and a year later the\nnumber had increased only to 29.\nThus, the real growth in this move\nment has been with tho last two years.\nMassachusetts now leads tho states\nwith 86 fresh air schools and classes\nfor tuberculous, anaemic and other\nschool children, Boston alono having\nover eighty. New York comes next\nwith 29, and Ohio is third with 21.\nOpen air schools havo now been estab\nlished in nearly 50 cities in 19 differ\nent states.\nBased on figures of population and\nmortality furnished by the United\nStates Bureau of the Census, it is\nestimated that not less than 100,000\nchildren now in school in the United\nStates wiU die of tuberculosis before\nthey aro eighteen years of age, or that\nabout 7000 of theso children dio an\nnually from this one disease. Estimat\ning that on an average each child who\ndies fronvtubcrculosis has had six years\nof schooling, the aggrcgato loss to this\ncountry in wasted education each year\namounts to well over $1,000,000.\nThis loss and much of tho incident\nsuffering could be materially decreased\nif open air schools or classes for these\nchildren and thoso who are sickly and\nanaemic were provided. Tho National\nAssociation estimates that there should\nbo one such school for every 25,000\npopulation, especially in cities.\nCHIPS.\n.Mrs. Jennie E.
