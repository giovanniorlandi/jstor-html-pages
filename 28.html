XL HAMILTON\nFwiMf Astortlslni Manager f Wanamakar!, Philadelphia\nAlt of you women whose husbands have totd you you have been\nspending too mucn money, please stand up. Great won. tvery\nmarried woman in America is on her feet\n\' All you who are earning your own living and spending as\nmuch as you earn please stand up.\nNow we\'ve got the rest of them.\n"Well," you say, "now that you\'re got us standing here what\nare you going to do about it?"\nI\'m going to give you the first law of business :\nCut your expenses down first, and then find out how you can\ndo it afterward.\nEvery big institution carries what it calls a "butcher."\nWhen the expenses of that institution begin to cat up the\nprofits the "butcher" issues a sweeping order to cut down so many\nhundreds of dollars a day. He doesn\'t ask how it can be done.\nHe knows it has to be done if his business is going to continue,\nand he leaves it to the people under him to find out how.\nThis cutting seldom if ever ruins a business. It simply\nsharpens the wits of those who are left\nNow let\'s take your case. Instead of taking the money that\nyou think you ought to have, suppose you take the money that\nyou have actually got. In your case, being both "butcher" and\nbuyer, you naturally have to sharpen your own wits.\nTherefore the first thing you begin to do each day (just as you\nare going to do now in a minute or two) is to open this paper and\nsee what special inducement each store is offering in the things\nthat are necessary for you to buy. You look for the clothes, and\nthe shoes, the children\'s dresses and suits, the underwear, the\nhouse needs, and all of the various necessities and luxuries de\nmanded in your standard of life.\nThe next thing to do is to cut out all those snobbish, exclu\nsive, little nonadvertising concerns, who find it somehow benegjh\ntheir dignity to sell their goods at less than a profit of several\nhundred per cent\nThe third thing you do is to reckon up your savings at the\nend of a week or two.\nAnd the fourth thing you do is to stand amazed at the\namount you have saved in spite of the amount you have bought\nNow of course this is letting you in behind the scenes.\nThere isn\'t a buyer in any store who doesn\'t have to bring\nhimself up with a jerk or get brought up with a jerk every once\nin a while, and who doesn\'t also stand amazed at what he has been\nable to accomplish with a smaller amount of capital and a greater\namount of energy and a little extra thimbleful of brains.\nNow don\'t tell anybody you have been behind the scenes, but\njust dig into the advertising in this paper quietly for the next\nfew days; cut out the "dropping-in-anywhere" method of shop\nping; make a business of your household expenditures, and see\nif this little friar"! plan doesn\'t relieve your terrible money\nstrain.\n(Copyrighted.)\nYears of Hard Times\nFinally Banished\nOklahoma Farmer Feels Proud of\nSuccess He had in His Case\nWith Master Tanlac\nThe fame of Tanlac, the Mas\nter Medicine has reached out\nover a greater part of the United\nStates. Every day men and\nwomen send orders by mail or\nvisit the cities where Tanlac it\non sale to buy the much talked\nof medicine. J. H. Hatkett, a\nwell known farmer of Lamont,\nOklahoma, stopped in the Dock\nurn Drug Store at Wichita the\nother day to see the Tanlac man\nand to get a supply of Tanlac to\ntake with him to Belvidere, Kan\nsas, where he was going on a\nvisit. Mr. Haskett took advan\ntage of his visit to express his\nsppreciation for what Tanlac\nbad done for him. He said:\n"I certainly feel proud of what\nTanlac did in my case. I have\nbad a pretty hard time for the\nlast few years with kidney trou\nble and rheumatism, and at\ntimes thought I would have to\ngive up. Whenever I lifted any\nthing heavy I would have a catch\nin my back and could hardly\nstraighten up. I bad severe\nptins around my kidneys and\nhips, and when I sat down I\ncould not get up without help or\nthe use of a cane.\nI heard about Tanlac through\nreading the papers, and ordered\ntome several weeks ago. . I have\ntakes three bottle to-date and I\nthink it is the most wonderful\nmedicine I ever took. I know it\nhas taken the pains all out of\nme, and I feel a hundred per\ncent better.\nTanlac is on sale in Bax\nter Springs at the M. E. Reddy\nDrug Store for $100 a bottle\nthree for $2.75 or six bottles for\n$5.00.\nMoney and\nits Making.\nTo make money is compara\ntively easy. To save it i more\ndifficult. To make it grow is a\nproblem.\nAnd not all of us are able to\nsolve the problem.\nBut if ever there was a time\nwhen we faced the opportunities\nfor making money grow, . that\ntime is now.\nEverybody knows that the\nprosperity of the nation depends\nprimarily upon the farmer and\nbis crops. If he plants in large\nacreages, and nature is good to\nhim, his vield is bountiful and\nhe becomes the habinger of an\nera of prosperity.\nWhen the farmer is plenti\nfully supplied with funds he\nwants new machinery and more\nmachinery, and the making of\nthese gives employment to mil\nlions of people.\nThese people in turn have\nmoney to spend and the mer\nchant begins to increase the vol\nume of his business and gather\nin greater profits.\nAnd as it is with these, so it is\nall down the line and extending\ninto every industry and into\nevery home.\nfHIS PAPER REPRESENTED FOR FOREIGN\nADVERTISING BY THE\nOKNKRAL OFFICES\nNEW YORK ANO CHICAGO\nBRANCHES IN ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES\nBaxter Springs News.\nPublished Every Thursday by\nNews Publishing Cokfamy.\nCbu.

This demand will come\nfrom every section of the globe\nand the buyer pays in gold.\nFor this reason we urge upon\nevery farmer the advisability,\neven the vital importance, of\ncultivating every possible foot of\nground, even to the doubling of\nyour acreage if such a thing be\nwithin the bounds of possibility.\nThe opportunity for making\nmoney is before you the great\nest you have ever seen, possibly\ngreater than you will ever see\nagain.\nYou are our mainstay, our\nbackbone, the one man upon\nwhom we all depend, to whom\nwe all turn as the child turns to\nits mother.\nYour success will be our suc\ncess, your prosperity our pros\nperity, your advancement our\nadvancement.\nYou are the man of the hour,\ninn the opportunity in before you.\nBackache is\nDiscouraging\nNothing more discouraging\nthan a constant backache.

R.\nFormer Advtrtlslng Manager\nTMa la so true that it needs no proof to bear it out The\naverage ahoe has sixty-two different parts, any of which can be\ncheapened to make a price, and none of which can be judged\nexcept by the highest expert in shoemaking. The average suit\nof clothes has a hundred and fifty-seven parts; the average pair\nof trousers has over sixty processes. The average fabric, even\nwhen it is absolutely all wool, through and through, can be made\nin many different grades. Your all silk socks can be made out of\npure, earth-grown fiber without your knowing it; and one man\nis now trying to make them entirely out of cheap glue.\nNow, the question is, if yon are starting out to buy some\nthing today, where shall you go?\n: The answer is very simple: If you do not know the merchan\ndise, you must know the merchant The way to judge the goods is\nto judge the man. And the best way to judje the man is through\nthe advertising.\nThe T"ni who advertises is the man who signs bis name to\nwhat he claims. If he signs his name to a bogus check, he goes\ninto jail; if he signs his name to bogus advertising he goes into\nbankruptcy. Every advertiser knows this, and so be is careful of\nwhat he jays. But the men who do not advertise do not have\nanything to lose. They do not have to be so careful of what they\nsay. It is merely a matter of personal integrity with them.\nThere are many thousands of fine merchants and honest men who\ndo not advertise. That is not the point. The question is how to\nfind them and how to tell them from the rest When they adver\ntise they must be honest\' if they hope to win.\nAnd this is the value of the Advertising Pages in this paper\ntoday. These are the men who have signed their names. These\nare the men who guarantee what they selL\nIt has been nearly three-qnarters of a century ago since the\nfirst great merchant, Alexander T. Stewart, trusted his commer\ncial ship on the advertising sea. And singularly enough this\ngreat man was flying flags of distress when he advertised. He put\nout a little dodger through the streets of New York, telling the\npeople frankly that he had bought too much and would sell it\n\' cheap.

R. HAMILTON\nFarmer Advartlalng Managar of Wanamakert, Philadelphia\nIt It said when John Howard Payne wrote "Home, Sweet\nHome," he himself was a homeless wanderer in the streets. It\ntook a man who had no home to make the spirit of home immortal.\nThe reason why we of today do not appreciate a home more\nis that it is too easy to have one. The place that onr grandfathers\n" called home was little more than a shelter. They knew no com\nforts such as we have. They had few luxuries, but the thing tnat\nthey called home had been fought for, and so it was dear to them.\nToday anyone can have a home almost for the asking. He\n"can fill it withbig, comfortable furniture that will give him as\nmuch comfort as used to belong only to royalty. He can have\n\'beautif ul draperies in his windows and fine pictures on his walls.\nHe can have a piano or a taixang macame. ue m\nthat are copies of the.patterns in palaces. And he can do all this\non the post moderate, the most ordinary of salaries or wages.\n, -Day by day this paper is filled with advertising that offers\nevery facility for the furnishing of the home. Not only can the\nman .with ready cash furnish his home on a moderate basis, but\nliatt .. een the man without cash can have all tne comions ana iuu\n" r rries he desires through a .iystem of credit on home furnishings\n1 - which has now become almost national in its scope.\ntMum trtM Mv homes are springing up on every\n, j,nd and the season, when old homes are being remodeled and\n\' wt-. . . \'.Try : -JT t. rm.,n, i im , onnnn for home\nrefurnisnea ior anouier year.\nfurnishing opportunities, which\nla offering -at this time. ... .. r\nV GivA these advertisers\' a hearing.\n4 i v rT-. i \' \' j Ji -s - o v t,\n-\' time in theTiistory of the world\nis widespread amongst the people as iney are waaj.\ni I Look over.this advertising today.
