I,\nsyte tuof municipal government, and\nalo devoted a portion of his address to\na comparison of American and European\nforms of city administration, declaring\nthat the American people had much to\nlearn In thia respect,\n"The first need in an understanding\nof this subject of municipal administra\ntion," declared Admiral Chadwick, "is\na realization of the immensity of our\nbackwardness in nearly all thing w\'nich\ngo to make the well organized, weff ad\nministered town. Though we are all agreed\nthat our municipal condition are in\ngenera) bad, I do not think that it is\nat all generally understood how very\nhad they are in comparison with thoe\nof well ordered cities in other countries.\nI have lately been abroad, and tried to\nkeep mv eyes oen as to what is doing\nIn Europe, and 1 must \' that the re\nsulting feeling was one of deep mortifi\ncation when 1 called up a recollection of\nome of our own conditions.

A mayor\nwith us is the accident of a day; tbe\nssme may be said of sU the rest of our\nofficial.

A\nchsnge to a greater permanency of office\namong our technical officials particularly\nis tliu our primal need. This necessity\ni everywhere else recognized. Taking\nEnglUh procedure, we find the e.-tual\nadministration wholly In the band of\ntechnical experts, who, I would also add,\nsre called from any part of the country.\n"But it is Germany which recognized\nin the greatest degree the business as\npect of municipal administration, acd it\nis to Germany that we must go to find\nits highest and best development. The\nmayor in Germany is a msyor by profes\nsion, a highly trained and experienced\ncity administrator. He may bo called,\nif he acquires a reputation,, from city\nto city. He is in fact an employe."\nTaking for his subject "Municipal\nGovernment by Board or Commission vs.\nMayor snd City Council," former Mayor\nJ. 1L Head, of Nashville, Tenn., said\nin part:\n"We may as well enter into this dis\ncussion with the distinct understsnding\nthat there is and can be no such thing\na a perfect, form of city government,\nso long as it has to be administered by\nimperfect men.\n"No matter what the form of city\ngovernment may be, it efficiency will\nbe determined very largely by those en\ntrusted with it administration. All that\nany of us can hope to do is to approxi-\nLinaU the ideal as neat as possible with\nthe material we have to deal with.\n"The highest ideal ever yet expred\nof any form of government is that it\nshould be a \'government of the people,\nby the people and for the people.\' and as\nwe approximate tlit standard we ap\nproach nearest to our ideals of a per\nfect form of government, whether it be\nfor the citv, the state, or the nation.\n"it took four years of war to prove\nto our own satisfaction that human\nslavery wag wrong, and should be abol\nished, even at the cost of confiscating\n4.00.000.0(H worth of property, the de\nstruction in, war of twice as much more,\nami tlie sacrifice of more than a mi\'lion\nprecious lives.\n"The problems of municipal govern\nment will lie solved without any of these\nsacrifice, and only \'at the trouble and\nexpense of convicting, a few more\nSchmidts and Reufs for their- betrayal\nof the public confidence, which, when\nfollowed with the convictiou of the\nheads of the public service corporations\nwho bribed these official to betray the\ntrusts which had been committed to\ntheir keeping, will appoint the way to\nprevent p repetition of these crimes\nagainst society and city government."\nWilliam H.

Tbe bird\nwas not a targe one and entered tbe anl-,\nmal\'s stomach alive. Tbe strangest part\nof the affair is that the bird did not\ndie immediately but managed to peck\nit way through the lining of the horse\'s\nstomach and through its hide. The\nhorse died and was found a few hour\nlater by W. F. Gary, a neighbor, with\nthe dead body of the hawk half pro\ntruding from the horse\' stomach.

This year\'s event has\ntaken a decided anti-clerical turn.\nIn the Vatican circles it is felt that a\nrevival of anti-clericalism is due to the\ndirect influence. Of the French enemies\nof the Papacy, who are working espec\nially through Free Masonry and are\naiming to start an agitation similar to\nthat in France.

He is gen\nerally a student of conditions upon\nwhich the unfoldment impigns, and fa\nmiliar with the agencies that contribute\nmost to that establishment. He and his\nbusiness are closely interwoven with the\nwork of carrying out the great program,\nand if he is any good at all, he is fore\nmost among the boosters and sings no\nother song whatever. Luckily for the\neraft at Astoria there is wide and justi\nfiable range for his every faculty for\npushing. Xo place in all Oregon, at this\ntime, is so directly in line for develop\nment and expansion, as this city, and\nhe who pushes Astoria now, himself,\ngoes ahead with his momentum to reap\nhandsomely from his endeavor. There is\nso great uproar afoot, about it, but\nthere is more genuine enthusiasm around\nhere based on tangible and actual knowl\nedge of what is to come, than has been\nknown, for years.\nThe real estate man is a pretty fair\nbarometer (provided his mercurial tend\nencies are not too pronounced), and as a\nbooster, he is the cream de la cream of\nbona fide promoters that is, in Astoria,\ne\nTOTALLY IRRECONCILEABLE.\nOklahoma, as a State, has gone on\nrecord as stoutly Democratic and im\nmensely Prohibition; a condition of\naffairs wholly irreconcileable, and which\npromises all sorts of confusion and\ntrouble in the future. Just how the\nblend was worked passes all understand\ning, and addressee itself to the univer\nsal mind as the newest expression of an\nancient mystery.\nAs a new, organic body of people,\nbanded lor the development of a com\nmonwealth of their own, they may\nsmother most of the incongruities cer\ntain to arise; and placate the tumult\nuous tendencies inherent in the situation\nMiy conceding, on the sly, to the Demo\ncratic appetite, which never yet, in the\nhistory of man, has withstood denial in\nthis particular. And any attempt to\npurge the dominent political faction of\nthe State of its well-known disposition\nto the convivial bowl will result in\nmanifest disaster to the abstemious\nfaction, for a Democratic relies devout\nly upon the suasion and effect of the\n"good old stuff" to carry most of his\npolitical engagements, and this aside\nfrom the individual propensity and in\ndulgence he stands for.\nWe can see infinite perplexity, if not\ncalamity, ahead of the fine new State\nand wish we could offer tome effective\nadvice in advance; but the real truth\nof the matter is, we of Oregon have a\nmix-up of our own altogether too simi\nlar to that of Oklahoma; and not vntil\nwe get rid of our own Democratic in\ncumbrances, can we venture to adminis\nter our sister. Once .we have \'done this,\nhowever, we will be glad to send her\nword as to how we did it.\nONE THOUSAND PER CENT.\nThe pressure of the law honestly and\nvigorously applied to Standard Oil af\nfairs at the New York investigation,\n\'developes the startling fact that that\nhuge concern enjoye a profit of 1000 per\ncent per annum on its investment and\nbusiness. By degrees the deep secrets\nof this accursed monopoly, long and\njealously hidden from the outside world,\nare being dragged into the open, and\npeople are beginning to learn the true\ninwardness of the term, and processes\nof, modern industrial "combinations." It\nis fast making socialists of people who\nnever knew, nor cared to know, the first\nprinciples of. that cult and if the\nAmerican temper is not altogether mis\nunderstood, there is going to be very\nbitter reckoning for the "full dress\'\' par\nasites and thieve who have thus wan\ntonly and shamelessly exploited the\nwhole nation aUliese years. And the\nhand and doctrine of resentment will not\nstop t the groat types of the evil, but\nin mirsuimt the destruction of the prin\nciple and practice, the reprisals will fall\nthick and fast in the rruaning 01 me\nlittle simulator, the petty local robber,\nas well as his atvh-type. The govern\nment of the United States was never\nengaged in a work of finer character\nthan it now pursuing in me uu\nmasking of this tremendous scheme of\nrobbery, and the hope of the nation is\nthat its course may bo such, that when\nit is through, there will be never -gain,\nthe faintest shadow of a show for the\nresumption of the blasting methods.\nMonopoly is on trial before the world\ntoday, and tomorrow we hope to chron\nicle the death of all its infinitely baa\nqualities, the worst of which have been\nexemplified by the infamous Standard\nOil Company, whose relentless and re\nmorselea code hid, wrought its own\nundoing.\nDRAWS HALF A MILLION A EAR.\nThough personally one of the quiett\nof men, John Hayes Hammond occupies\na position asa mining engineer second\nto no other man in the worm it ne n\nto be judged by his responsibilities and\nthe\' salary he draws. So begins an inter\nesting article on Mr. Hammond and his\ncareer in the Technical World magazine\nfor October. As consulting engineer of\nthe vast interests of the Guggenheim\nExploration Company, Mr. Hammond\nis said to receive foOO.OOO a year. At\nany rate he has attained wealth by\nhis profession and lives in a princely\nstyle at Laewood, X. J. Mr. Hammond\nis a native of California, and was at\none time consulting engineer of the\nCentral Pacific and Southern Pacific\nrailways. He is a graduate of tins\nSheffield Scientific School at Yale Uni\nversity and of the Royal Sehoo. of\nMiues in Saxony. He was sent by the\ngeological survey to examine the . gold\nfields of California and his interest be\ncame so intense that he made a study\nof mines and mining properties his life\nwork. The tremendously rich Bamato\nbrothers of London sent Mr. Hammond\nto report on their mines in South Africa.\nIt was while there that he became asso\nciated with Dr. Jameson and mixed up\nIn the movement that led to the Jame\nson Raid.

The cover of the washstanl has\nbeen on there for two long, hard, busy\ndirty years, and the bed looks like a\nswayback horse with a thin blanket\nover it. If I were to try to sleep on\nthat bed I would arise in the morning\nlooking like a waffle. The wall paper\nis off in large patches-yin fact, it is off\nin a bunch. The ceiling is cracked, and\na yard or so of plastering is liable to\nfall and smother me in the landslide\nat any moment. That table is really\nonly a one night stand, and you couldn\'t\nwrite on it if you had two men stand\ning and holding it.\nBy this time the porter was very\ntired and angry, so he cried out in his\nvexation:\n"That\'s right-kick kkkl But I\'ll\nbet a dollar you\'re not used to any\nbetter than this at home.\n\'Young man," said the stranger in\nPunktown, "your bet is begging for\ntakers.

I\nhoped that X would find something com\nfortable and clean, and perhaps even\nelegant at a hotel."\nMoved to tears of compassion by rea\nson of the man\'s honesty, the porter\nsurreptitiously escorted him to Parlor\nA. where things were much better, be\ncause the wash pitcher had a shallow\ncrack in it, and there was one up\nholstered chair.

Some con\neern is expressed by United States mili\ntary authorities at the large number of\nJapanese immigrants coming to this\ncountry with close association witb the\nRu.sso-Japancse war. It is no exagger\nation to say that fully 50 per cent of\nthe Japanese who have been deported\nwithin the last three months are known\nto liave seen service with the Japanese\ntroops.\nOf course this may be only a singular\ncoincidence. Some of the more appre\nhensive officials at Washington, however,\nprefer to take the view that there may\nbe something sinister in the efforts of\nthe Japanese military men to gain en\ntrance into this country. In some cases\nno attempt U made to conceal the fact\nthat the new arrivals are veterans of\nthe Ruso-Japanese war. They wear rag\nged regimentals and two other relics of\nhard campaigns of two years ago. Oth\ners, however, have nothing about their\nappearance to indicate that they are\narmy men. They wear the usual plain\ncivilian garb of the impoverished Japan\nese, and it is only by chance that the\nimmigration officials discover their for\nmer occupation.\nCommissioner-General of Immigration\nFrank P. Sargent said today that in\nevery batch of Japanese deported bv the\nUnited States it is easy to find mn\nwho have served in the Japanese army.\nHe added that the Japanese were not\nsent back because ,thcy were military\nmen, but for the fact that they were\nin the United States without having\ncomplied with the new immigration law.\nThis requires that every Japanese not\na member ,of the exempted class shall\nhave a certificate from the Japanese\ngovernment.\nSargent said that many of these men\nstill wear the costume of the en\'isted\nmen. It is reported that recently out\nof seventy-one Japanese deported, Sfty\none were ex-privates and twelve ex\nofficers. In view of the wcll-authentieated\nstories of Japanese naval officers serv\ning as cabin boys in the American ravy,\nUnited States military authorities feel\nthat there is reason for apprehension in\nthe fact that so many former soldiers\nof Japan are applying for admission here.\nIt U known that the Japanese govern\nment is industriously engaged In seek\ning military information, not only in the\nUnited States, but very generally over\nthe globe. A report of our1 govcrainent\nrecently filed in Washington, says that\na couple of Japanese attaches at Boston\nwere busily engaged in plotting the har\nbor. They made no effort to concenl\ntheir purpose and one of them farnkty\nadmitted that brother officers were doing\nthe same work in other part of the\nworld.\nAGAIN RUNS AWAY,\nOUR MOTTO\n" Perfection in Workmanship\nPromptness in Execution\nSatisfaction In Prices.

Gondon,\nof Chicago.\n"The advance of municipal ownership\nand operation of public utilities in the\nInlted Suites and Canada has been due\nin a great measure to emotional preju\ndice, and error in estimating financial\nresult,\nThe ownership and operation of util\nities are matters of pure economics.\nThey are most emphatically not moral\nquestions despite the efforts to make it\nappear o. Wpw owns and operates\npublic utilities ia trivial compared to\nhow they are operated.\nIn finding that "The success of muni\ncipal operation of public utilities de\npends upon the existence in the city of\na high capacity for municipal govern\nment, the investigating committee of\nthe National Civic Federation in its\nnearly unanimous report, stated a great\ntruth. This "high capacity" or muni\ncipal government has yet to be estab\nlished in America. The fault is not in\ning the stockholders of service corpo\nrations rich. It is a matter of common\nknowledge that these profits are being\nand have been reduced to slender mar\ngins, and with many companies, iped\nout altogether.\nThe inability of municipal plants to\nbuy supplies, materials, brains or labor\nss cheaply as private industries more\nthan overcomes this margin,\nPRISON TERM FOR ART THIEF,\n11 trntrntm\nEdward Morris, Who Engineered London\nRobbery, Gets Seven Years.\nLONDON, Sfpt. 19.

It is only recently that we have dis\ncovered some of the latent power of\nour forms of popular government. Ten\nyears ago laws like the public utilities\nacts of New York and Wisconsin \'would\nhave been regarded impossible.\nTrue, count lots efforts have been made\nbefore to regulate corporations of differ\nent inds. Failure to get good results\ncaused these attempts to become objects\nof derision. Under these condition) the\ntheory of municipal ownership waxed\nfat and hearty.\nThat municipal ownership has\ndone good as a punishment and a warn\ning is not to be denied. Perhaps the\ngrwucst evils remaining lie in taiei\nwidespread and assiduouslv matured irn-\nprcusion that the scheme is meritorious\nund susceptible t\'o universal application.\nI lucre may! be places very few\nwhere it is a good thing to hold in re-\nferv over corporations holding long time\nfranchises or "perpetual" rights, or\nwhere the admission of other corpora.\ntions of the same kind is not feasible.\nBut the American public should be res\ncued from the idea that municipal own\nership is an automatic remedy for var\nious municipal ills (as the Civic Fcder-\nturn\'s committee inaits it is not), and\ntaught the timth. The truth is nothing\nmore or less than that successful muni\ncipal ownership under a form of popular\ngovernment is extremely hard to attain,\nIt must be the product of conditions\nnot found in the average American\ncity aud rightly classed as abnormal.\nWe are entering an era, I believe,\nwhen the former derision of our gov\nernmental efforts to regulate corpora\ntions will be forgotten by the successful\nregulation of these corporations by\nproperly, constituted authorities. Back\ned by well-defined and earnest sentiment\nthere is no ground to fear that any law\nor set of laws will not be rigidly en\nforced. In the pest the method towards regu\nlation have been crude and ineffective\nbecause both people and officials recog\nnized the crudeness. New methods, are\nbeinj perfected and the support of the\nbody politic assures thoruogh execution.\nA publio service corporation under\nstatutes such as exist in New York and\nWisconsin is absolutely at the mercy\nof agents of the law, equipped with\nadequate devices to secure obedience.\nThe capital invested in these corpora\ntions does not wish to be devoured in\nwhole br in part. The only other alter\nnative lies iu treating the publio fairly\nin the matter of prices end service and\nliving up to the law. This plan certainly\nis sounder and more apt to produce the\nresults expected that the adoption of\nmunicipal ownership can hope to save a\nconfusion of direction, susceptibility to\n"practical politics", usual financial lasses\nand not unusual inefficiency.
