Recent\nhunting parties report deer exceed\ningly scarce, so much so that some\nhave Teturned without a deer and\nothers have considered themselves\nlucky to get as much as one.

From an\neconomic standpoint, however, the\ndisappearance of all game will be\nno loss, for it will not only save\ncattlemen many a trespass upon\ntheir property, but will perhaps\ndivert the leisure of those wh\'bhave\n-contracted the hunting habit into\n-more profitable channels.

Mail and passengers\nwere brought over in hacks. Not\na wheel has turned out of this city\ntodav over either the National or\nTexas-Mexican. A bunch of strikers\nwere brought before the district\njudge this afternoon on the charge\nof violating tWi injunction issued\nTuesday.\nOne of the lof ders was fined $100\nand given thrju deys in jail. The\nbalance ere discharged. The\nrailwav officials have wired the\nGovernor for a company of rangers\nand nave also complained to the\nFederal authorities that strikers\nwere interfering with the mails. In\nconsequence of these representations\nUnited States Marshal Hanson is\nen route here tonight from Galves\nton. If any reply has been received\nfrom the Governor it has not been\nmade public. Sheriff Ortiz in an\ninterview this evening strongly re\nsents the appeal to the Governor,\nsaying he is fully able to handle\nthe situation.

Subjected to this test, he\nfailed so totally and ignominiously\nthat the unanimous protest of an\nindignant people forced him to re\nsign and commit the management\nof our army to competent hands.\nAll the scandals of the army in the\nSpanish war embalmed beef, faul\nty transportation, fever camps, com\nmissions bestowed by a rule of\npolitical and social favoritism.\nShafter, and all the other multitud\ninous and odorous national repro\naches of that war are piled up\nagainst the record of Russell A.\nAlger as secretary of war.
