        <pre>['Part one of a two-part study \nof the Congress of Vienna\nAppeasement at Vienna\nBy M. K. DZIEWANOWSKI\nAuthor and Journalist\nPUSHING FORWARD on the heels of the \ndisorderly retreat of the remnants of \nthe Grande Armee, Russian troops occupied \nthe Duchy of Warsaw in the winter of \n1812-13.\nRussia’s authority rose immeasurably. \nOnce more Peter the Great’s plan to unite \nall Polish lands under Russian rule came \nwithin reach of Russian policy, and Czar \nAlexander decided to put this plan through \nhimself. “ Only the possession of all Poland” \n—said the Czar in a conversation with his \nprincipal assistant, Nesselrode— “ will set up \nconditions for the realization of our eastern \nplans, and permit us to sing a Te Deum in \nSanta Sofia in Constantinople.”\nAlthough, formally speaking, the Russian \narmies were only occupying the Duchy, \nCzar Alexander was nevertheless able to \nbehave from the outset as if he were the \nlegal ruler, thanks to the position held by \nRussia among the Allies. His aim was to win \nthe sympathy of the Poles, by promising to \nunite all Polish territories under his rule \nand to be crowned King of Poland. He also \nextended these promises to the Grand Duchy \nof Lithuania, incorporated in Russia, and \nto the areas under Prussian and Austrian \nrule.\nDuring his stay in Paris, in April and \nMay, 1814, he attempted to win over Napo\xad\nleon’s Polish soldiers and the Polish colony \nby unfolding before them the vision of a \nrestored republic under his scepter. On \nApril 24, 1814, after reviewing the Polish \ntroops stationed near Paris, and addressing \nassembled units, the Czar ceremoniously \npromised to assure “ the welfare of the Polish \nnation.” Early in May, he despatched to \nGeneral Kosciuszko, leader of the first Polish \nRising of 1794 against Russia, a cordial\nletter assuring the Pole of his best inten\xad\ntions and asking for his support.\nToward the end of May, Alexander re\xad\nceived an invitation to visit London. He ar\xad\nrived in the British capital on July 7, ac\xad\ncompanied by his friend Czartoryski, the \nleader of the pro-Russian party in Poland. \nThe London Press referred to the Czar as \nthe restitutor orbis, and he was particularly \npopular among extreme republican groups. \nIn the poorer districts and suburbs, where \nthe Regent could not even make an appear\xad\nance, Alexander was greeted with enthu\xad\nsiasm. The University of Oxford conferred \non him a doctorate honoris causa as “ the \ndefender of Europe’s rights.” During his stay \nin London, the Czar attempted to win over \nthe Whig leaders, tricking them by promises \nof liberal reforms in his own country. As \nto the territories which Russia had received \nin reward for the part she had played in \nthe war, Alexander promised to give them \n“ a statute in accordance with the traditions \nand feelings of the local population.”\nAustrian diplomacy, aware of Alexander’s \nPolish plans and trading on the Regent’s \npersonal dislike of the Czar, was meanwhile \nworking to effect a closer rapprochement \nbetween Austria and Britain before the \nforthcoming Congress. The Austrian Am\xad\nbassador in London, Count Merveldt, did his \nbest to make the British Cabinet see the \ndanger to both Britain and Europe of incor\xad\nporating the Grand Duchy of Warsaw into a \nRussia already enlarged by Finland and \nMoldavia. These efforts appear to have met \nwith some success. “England will sacrifice \nanything,”  Merveldt wrote in a report to \nMettemich in July, 1814, “ rather than see \nEurope’s freedom endangered. For other\xad\nwise, Europe which fought France to be free\n16\n', 'Appeasement at Vienna 17\nof the latter’s despotism, would become an \ninstrument of Russian despotism.”\nThe crudity with which Alexander, to\xad\nward the end of his stay in England, began \nto justify the necessity for incorporating \nPolish territories, offended the majority of \nthose partisans whom he had succeeded in \nwinning over in the first days of his visit to \nBritain. With increasing frequency, the pub\xad\nlic received warnings both in the press and \nin Parliament against placing too much \nconfidence in Moscow.\nThe Czar left London in an irritated mood, \ndetermined to break down the hostile front \nwhich Mettemich had begun to build up \nagainst Russia in the Allied camp. On his \nreturn journey, as he was passing through \nWarsaw, he set up a committee to reorgan\xad\nize the administration and legislature. While \nreceiving a Polish delegation, he said:\n“ If I am not able to do so otherwise, I will \nremove with the sword any obstacles pre\xad\nventing me from reconstructing Poland.”\nIn September, on his way to the Congress \nof Vienna, he said at Pulawy:\n“ Now Poland is going to be my chief con\xad\ncern. I am going to work for her when I join \nthe Congress. Am I not her only friend?” \nSome days earlier, in Kamienny Ostrow, \nAlexander had held a long conversation \nwith Nesselrode, who was leaving earlier \nfor Vienna. He charged the latter to spare \nno efforts to prepare the ground for his own \narrival, and did not fail to emphasize the im\xad\nportance which Russia attached to a settle\xad\nment of the Polish question according to her \nown interests.\n‘The Duchy of Warsaw is my conquest \nover Napoleon,’ he said to Nesselrode. \n‘When I was beating his treacherous attack, \nI had almost all Europe in coalition against \nme. Today, when the successes of our arms \nmake it possible for the main states of \nEurope to be reconstituted within the pre\xad\nwar boundaries, and even, in some cases, to \nbe enlarged, it is only fair that my people \nshould receive a reward for their part in \nthe struggle. It is also fair that Russia should \nacquire frontiers that could guarantee her\nagainst future invasion......... Should you be\nasked questions regarding the system of \ngovernment I propose to establish in the ter\xad\nritories to be annexed, avoid answering such \nquestions.’\nFamiliar with Prussian appetites, and \nrealizing the weak position of the King of \nSaxony— a former ally of Napoleon—Alex\xad\nander resolved to gain Prussia’s support for \nhis incorporation of the Duchy of Warsaw \nby promising that Prussia should be com\xad\npensated with all Saxony. Prussia favored \nthis plan, on the condition that Poznan and \nTorun were thrown in.\nIn July, 1814, the Danish Ambassador to \nVienna wrote to his Foreign Secretary: \n“ There is no secrecy about that; Prussia is \nagreeable to let Poland pass to Russia at \nthe price of acquiring Saxony.” The consent \nof Prussia, however, could not be sufficient \nby itself. Both Austria and France were \ncategorically opposed to Prussian aims, \nwhile Britain’s attitude was also unfavor\xad\nable, despite the marked dislike which Lord \nCastlereagh had for the Saxon King. On the \nquestion of Poland, Austria, France, and \nGreat Britain were all very definitely op\xad\nposed to Alexander’s plans, regarding them \nas a menace to the European balance of \npower.\nRecognizing how strongly Metternich \nfeared Russian expansion toward central \nEurope, Hardenberg, Prussian Secretary for \nForeign Affairs, decided to play a double \ngame: to get what could be had of Saxon \nterritory by blackmailing Austria with the \nRussian bogey, or to obtain a substantial \npart or all of Saxony in return for collabo\xad\nrating with Russia.\nRUSSIAN DIPLOMACY\nAlexander arrived in Vienna on Septem\xad\nber 25, determined to impose his will on \nthe Congress, by force, if necessary. Russia, \nin his view, needed to annex the Duchy of \nWarsaw in order to round off the conquests \nof the last 20 years, Finland and Moldavia. \nThe autocrat who had demanded immense \nsacrifices from his country felt that he must \nreturn from the Congress with the only re\xad\ncompense which would be fully appreciated \nby his people: territorial conquests.\nThe Czar knew that he would have two \nmain opponents; he decided to draw at least \none over to his side. He thought that the \nrepresentative of defeated France should \nfeel less certain than the other powers at\n', '18 Current History, January, 1949\nVienna; he determined to win Talleyrand \nby threats or persuasion. Talleyrand avoided \na face-to-face encounter with the Czar, \nfearing an unavoidable quarrel. A  dramatic \nmeeting, however, finally took place on Octo\xad\nber 2, on the eve of the official opening of \ndiscussions. When Talleyrand decidedly re\xad\nfused to support the Russian plans, the Czar \nlost control and declared, stressing every \nword:\nAlexander: “ I shall hold what is in my \npossession.”\nTalleyrand: “ Your Imperial Majesty will \nreceive only what rightfully belongs to \nyou.”\nAlexander: “There can be no talk of right \nfor those who betrayed Europe and joined \nwith Napoleon, like the King of Saxony.”\n“ The betrayal of Europe is only a ques\xad\ntion of dates. Other states too were in alli\xad\nance with Napoleon,”  replied Talleyrand, in \nobvious allusion to Russia’s former collabo\xad\nration with Napoleon.\nThe Congress was finally opened on \nOctober 3, after several postponements. The \ndiplomatic conversations on the two main \nquestions before the Congress, Poland and \nSaxony, were carried on between the four \npowers, Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Rus\xad\nsia. France was admitted only on January \n9, when both questions had really been de\xad\ncided.\nJust before the Congress formally began, \nthe four powers issued a declaration in which \nthe principle was enunciated that “ the \ndisposal of territories conquered from the \nenemy falls to the power by whose en\xad\ndeavors these territories have been liber\xad\nated.”  This declaration was forced through \nby Russia and Prussia, against the weak \nopposition of Austria and Great Britain, \nwhose representatives did not wish to come \nto blows, at the very beginning of the dis\xad\ncussions, over a question which in their \nopinion had no major practical significance.\n“ One cannot make excessive difficulties \nfrom the very beginning,” was Castlereagh’s \nopinion. Talleyrand, however, held quite the \nopposite view. He thought that the Congress, \nwhich had been called to put into practice \nthe principles which were to govern the \npolitical life of Europe from then on, should\nshow more respect for these principles. His \nadvice met with no response.\nOn October 8, at a session of the Central \nCommittee composed of eight states, two \ntrends stood out very clearly. Talleyrand, \nMetternich, and Castlereagh supported the \nview that the discussions aimed at carrying \nout the principles of legitimism and the \nEuropean balance of power. Russia and \nPrussia, however, aimed only at securing \nprofit and a share of the loot for themselves.\nWhen Talleyrand proposed, at the begin\xad\nning of the session, that the initial declara\xad\ntion should state that “ the deliberations of \nthe Congress would take place in accordance \nwith the principles of the law of nations,”  \nboth Prussian delegates, Hardenberg and \nHumboldt, made an energetic protest.\n“ Why this addition,” cried Hardenberg, \n“ it is self-understood. . . .”\n“ It will be still better understood,” re\xad\nplied Talleyrand, “ if it is definitely stated.” \nOn October 12, Castlereagh decided to \nplace before the Czar a comprehensive \nmemorandum on the Polish question. He re\xad\nminded Alexander of the Treaty of Kalisz \nbetween Prussia and Russia of February \n28, 1813, concluded “ to free Europe from the \ntyranny of Napoleon,” and providing for a \npartition of the Duchy of Warsaw between \nthe two powers.\n“ Contrary to this Treaty,” ran the memo\xad\nrandum,\nRussia has put forward claims to the whole \nof Polish territory, basing this on the fact \nthat her armies were the first to occupy \nthese areas. The annexation, carried out by \nforce, gives Russia, already strengthened by \nthe conquest of Finland and Moldavia, al\xad\nmost the whole of Poland. . . . This move \ndesigned to rally Poles around the Russian \nstandard cannot fail to cause apprehension \nto the whole of Europe, so desirous of peace \nand respite.\nWhile acknowledging the services of the \nRussian nation and its great ruler to the war \neffort of the Allies, Europe sees no justifica\xad\ntion for his plans, which must necessarily \nlead to the undermining of the European \nbalance of power.\nIt is difficult to imagine that the incor\xad\nporation in Russia of all Polish territories \ncould be recognized as a dictate of morality, \nas Russian diplomacy proclaims. If the Czar \ndesires to amend the lot of the Poles he can \ndo so first and foremost with regard to those\n', 'Appeasement at Vienna 19\ncitizens of Polish nationality who are al\xad\nready within the boundaries of the Russian \nempire, or by really restoring an indepen\xad\ndent Polish kingdom within its frontiers of \nthe 1791 Constitution.\nUntil Russia abides by her original proj\xad\nects, any kind of restoration of the balance \nof Europe is impossible.\nThe Russian delegates were very much \nfrightened by the role which Talleyrand \nwas playing at the Congress and, therefore, \ntried to isolate France and to exclude her \nrepresentative at the deliberations of the \nself-constituted committee of four which de\xad\ncided all more important questions in a \nconfidential manner, only informing the \nminor states of its decisions post factum. La \nvoix confidentialle was the discovery of \nMetternich, who won the fervent support of \nthe Russian and Prussian delegations. While \nother lesser matters were settled by the \nCentral Committee, the Polish and Saxon \nquestions were decided by the big four. \nTalleyrand was kept informed on most \npoints by Metternich, who, although he \nfeared the influence of the powerful per\xad\nsonality of his old enemy, realized that \nFrance could not be kept out of the Concert \nof Europe.\nTHE BIG FOUR\nThe powers which had been in accord in \nthe spring of 1814 as to the military opera- \ncions designed to defeat Napoleon as quickly \nas possible, now split up into two opposing \ncamps when it came to the settlement of \nfundamental political problems. Russia \nwished to swallow the whole Duchy of War\xad\nsaw in return for handing Saxony over to \nPrussia. Prussia agreed to this principle, but \nat the same time wanted a part of the Duchy of \nWarsaw, and in particular, Poznan and Torun. \nShe was not, however, sure whether these \ncities would be more easily obtained with \nRussian or Austrian assistance. Neither \nAustria nor France was anxious to see the \nPrussians in Dresden or the Russians in \nWarsaw, although Austria was the more \ndirectly interested in both cases. French \ndiplomacy, on the other hand, while opposed \nto changes which might weight the Euro\xad\npean balance against her, also treated the \nPolish and Saxon questions as a tactical\nspring-board, which would make it possible \nto show the absurdity of leaving France out\xad\nside the Concert.\nCastlereagh, who was well aware of the \nFrench tactics, took the initiative in settling \nthe Polish problem within the big four. He \nset for himself the task of forcing a decision \nby mobilizing Austria and Prussia who, with \nBritish support, had chances of compelling \nRussia to accept a settlement which would \nnot harm the European balance of power. \nCastlereagh knew of Metternich’s views \nand of Prussia’s hesitations. He sent a \nmemorandum to these two powers, suggest\xad\ning that proposals be laid before Alexander \nwhich, if rejected by him, would make it \nevident beyond all doubt who was to blame.\nThe memorandum proposed: (1) The re\xad\nconstruction of Poland within the frontiers \nthat she had prior to the first partition; (2) \nThe restoration of the Kingdom of Poland \nof 1791; (3) In the event that neither of \nthese were accepted by Alexander, a return \nto the sad alternative of partitions.\nAccording to C. K. Webster, the main bi\xad\nographer of Castlereagh, the British states\xad\nman was under the impression that\nby himself directing the negotiations he \ncould . . . .  force Russia to give way before \nthe united opposition of her three Allies. \n. . . .  His main object, as he told his Cabinet \nin November, was the establishment of a \n“just equilibrium” meant as strengthening \nthe center of Europe against the East and \nWest. For this purpose he wished, not only \nfor a strong Prussia, but also for an alliance \nbetween Prussia and Austria. The extension \nof Russian domination over the whole of \nPoland he regarded as a real menace to the \nsecurity of Central Europe. He would \nnaturally have been glad to obtain an in\xad\ndependent Poland. But, though he constantly \nrendered lip service to this idea, it was never \ncontemplated as a possible solution either \nby him or by any other statesman at the \nCongress.\nOn October 30, Alexander sent a reply to \nCastlereagh’s memorandum. To his letter \nwas attached a detailed supplement, in \nwhich he attempted to present Russia as a \nthreatened state which needed a Polish \nbuffer-state to secure its western posses\xad\nsions. At the same time, informed by his \nfriends and counsellors of Talleyrand’s sug\xad\ngestions, and the part they had played in\n', '20 Current History, January, 1949\nstiffening the. British and Austrian attitude, \nhe decided to have it out with Talleyrand, \nwhom he considered an opponent even more \ndangerous than Metternich. Eventually a \nstormy conversation took place between \nthem.\nAlexander: “ In Paris you used to favor \nthe restoration of the Kingdom of Poland.”\nTalleyrand: “ So I did, but then there was \nno question of the integrity of Polish in\xad\ndependence.”\nAlexander: “ I have 200,000 men in the \nfield there. Let anyone try to throw me out.\nI agreed to Saxony being handed over to \nPrussia, and Great Britain gave her consent \nto it.”\nTalleyrand: “ How could Great Britain \nhave surrendered what belonged to the King \nof Saxony?”\nAlexander (losing control): “ If the King \nof Saxony does not abdicate, I will have \nhim deported to Russia, and let him perish \nthere. King Stanislaw Poniatowski died in \nexile in Russia. . . .”\nTalleyrand: “ I did not think that the Con\xad\ngress had met in order to sanction attempts \non the lives of legitimate monarchs.”\nThe Tsar then rushed furiously from the \nroom without taking leave of his opponent.\nMETTERNICH\nAn open conflict was in the air. On No\xad\nvember 2, Metternich sent a long note to \nCastlereagh and Hardenberg concerning \njoint action by Austria, Great Britain, and \nPrussia in the Polish question. In it, he \nstressed that Austria had always been op\xad\nposed in principle to the partitions of the \nPolish Republic, and had participated in \nthem only to safeguard her own interests; \nhe demanded a complete restoration of \nPolish independence within the frontiers \nprior to the first Partition. The whole note \nwas based on suggestions put forward by \nGreat Britain, with one change. This was the \nprovision that in the event of its proving \nimpossible by peaceable means to force on \nRussia even the Poland of 1791, the Vistula \nshould be acknowledged as the frontier be\xad\ntween Prussia and Russia, with Warsaw \ngoing to the latter. Torun would, on the \nother hand, go to Prussia. Simultaneously\nMetternich asked Hardenberg and Hum\xad\nboldt to examine the possibilities of putting \nthrough the first two proposals, and in the \nevent of a threat of armed conflict, at least \nthe third.\nA few days later, Hardenberg handed to \nCastlereagh a secret memorandum describ\xad\ning the failure of his conversation with \nAlexander, and advising acceptance of the \nRussian propositions.\n“This solution,”  declared Hardenberg, \n“ is beneficial to the whole of Europe, since \nit permanently weakens the Russian Empire, \nsowing the seed of discord between a con\xad\nstitutionally governed Poland and a Russia \ncondemned to absolutism.”\nTalleyrand, aware that the Congress had \nreached a critical point, determined to use \nall his influence to cement the forces joined \nin defense of Poland and Saxony. “The \nAllies,” said he, addressing Metternich and \nLord Castlereagh, “ fought to be rid of Napo\xad\nleon. They need not have done so if their \nintention was to let such things be done as \nthe annexation of two States so essential to \nthe equilibrium of Europe, against the \nprinciples of legitimacy and the principles \nof the law of nations.”\nTalleyrand noted the vague attitude of \nGreat Britain, and resolved to try yet \nanother course. This led through the bed\xad\nchamber. The Czar’s mistress, Princess Bag- \nration, promised to do all in her power to \ndeter the Czar from carrying out his plans. \nOn the night of October 30, Alexander \nvisited the Princess between the hours of \n10 p.m . and 2 a .m . So, as the police agent’s \nreport says: “ there was time for political \ndiscussion too.”\nThe Princess did not, however, succeed \nin convincing the Czar, who did not even \nwant to listen to her arguments. “ He con\xad\nsidered that his honor and prestige were here \nengaged, since he had given his word to the \nPolish patriots and must keep it.” He is re\xad\nported to have said to the Princess that “ if \nsomebody wished to oppose his plans by \nforce, he would march at the head of his \narmies as far as Berlin and Munich.”\nWe are, however, not quite sure whether \nshe tried very hard to fulfill the promise she \nhad given to Talleyrand. In her Memoirs,\n', 'Appeasement at Vienna 21\nunder the date of October 30, one finds only \none remark: Pendant les moments les plus \ndecisifs avec mon amant, je priais a Dieu: \nMon Dieu, je demande pardon de I’exces de \nmon bonheur. . . !\nAt the beginning of November, Alexander \nofficially rejected the Austrian and British \nproposals, and the situation became very \ntense. Prussia inclined more and more to \nthe Russian side, being mainly concerned \nwith swallowing up Saxony and not wishing \nto offend Russia too much. The temporary \nfriendship between Austria and Prussia, \nborn out of the exigencies of the fighting \nagainst Napoleon in 1815, gave way to \nmutual distrust, since Metternich considered \nthe presence of Prussian forces in Dresden \nas a menace to the possessions of the Crown \nof St. Wenceslas. On their side, the Prussians \nconsidered annexation as their main war \naim.\nThe overcharged atmosphere is described \nin a report sent by the Chief of the Secret \nPolice, Hager, to the Emperor Francis.\nPublic opinion is contemplating, not \nwithout reason, the possibility of the Con\xad\ngress being broken up in consequence of a \nnew war between Austria and Prussia over \nthe question of Poland and Saxony. It is \ncommon talk that the Czar is a wolf in \nsheep’s clothing, and people are beginning \nto say with increasing frequency that the \nonly politician who is thinking of the fate of \nthe whole of Europe is Talleyrand. The \nGospel does not cease to be the Gospel, even \nif preached by the Devil.\nThe smaller German states, alarmed by\nthe fate which appeared to await Saxony at \nthe hands of the big four, were getting more \nand more disturbed. A new war seemed to \nbe imminent.\nThe Congress was in a blind alley: its \nchairman, Metternich, arranged a confer\xad\nence with Talleyrand, where, after reveal\xad\ning the existing difficulties, he asked in the \nnames of Castlereagh and Nesselrode for \nassistance in finding a way out. Talleyrand \ncounselled an unyielding attitude; he thought \nthat both Russia and Prussia would at all \ncosts avoid war.\nMeanwhile, Alexander, who was con\xad\nvinced that if he could win over Prussia \nonce and for all it would weight the scales \nin his favor, decided on a bold stroke. He \ninvited the King of Prussia to dinner on \nDecember 6; during the meal the Czar suc\xad\nceeded in convincing his guests that the \nRussian solution of the problem of the \nDuchy of Warsaw, in return for support of \nPrussian claims on Saxony, would best ac\xad\ncord with the aims and interests of both \nstates. At the end of the dinner, Hardenberg \nwas summoned. To him the Czar announced, \nin his own name and that of his bewildered \nand somewhat befuddled guest, that a \ntreaty, final and immovable, had been con\xad\ncluded between the two powers. The stunned \nHardenberg objected strenuously. Alexander \ncalled him to order, reminding him of the \nduty of obedience he owed to his monarch. \n[Mr. Dziewanowski concludes his study oj \nthe Congress of Vienna in the February \nissue.]\nJohn Holland, an Englishman, founded the Bank of Scotland one year after Wil\xad\nliam Patterson, a Scotsman, founded the Bank of England.\nThe total number of vetoes exercised in the Security Council is 30. Of this total, \nRussia is responsible for 28 vetoes while France is responsible for two: a veto on a \nprocedural point in connection with the Spanish case in 1946, and a veto on the In\xad\ndonesian question of 1947.\nAn ancient Athenian candidate for public office delivered a lengthy address in \nwhich he promised many reforms and benefits to his fellow citizens. In response to \nthis oratory, his opponent arose and made his speech in eight words:\n“All that he has said I will do.”\n']</pre>
