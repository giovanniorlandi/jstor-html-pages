Edison re\nplying to questions from fellow\nmembers of the national board of\ndefense, is reported to have\nmade this statement:\n"To my mind there is no\nreason why an under-sea boat\nshould not be equipped with a\nfishgill-like apparatus, so that it\ncan draw its supply of air direct\nly from the water. Thus the lives\nof the crew will not be dependent\nupon the compressed air supply\nor on the ability of the boat to\nreach the surface.

It is so hard on the soul life.\nThe critic never enjoys life. If you\nexpect to really grow into big life, have\nmental hospitality. Critics are always\n.dull people. They never have new\nthoughts. Only minds that are like\ngreat daily newspapers having many\nreporters from ail the world, become\ncosmopolitan. Critical minds are al\nways provincial. They never have the\ntang and odor of the fresh and grow\ning. As long as a man has his mind on the j\nfuture, he will be young. He has. the ;\nadvantages of a growing hope. He i\nwho always dreams and thinks of the !\npast, sees the world as though a hot j\nwind was always blowing over it. Al- i\nway3 Drown ana never at its Dest.\nHonesty of purpose is the first qual\nity of an efficient mind. The break\ndowns of most plans take place because\nof an evil mind. Mental shipwrecks\ntake place because of mental badness.\nIf you propose .to succeed, you will find\nyou must have a full mind to draw up\non. It must be stored with facts past\nthat you may be able to bring some\nthing to each new endeavor.\nYour mind never does its best on the\nfirst voyage. You must train it. Your\nmind must be sharpened. Real mental\nefficiency consists in being able to look\nclosely, widely, fairly and highly. You\nmust not only - be able to see largely\nbut without blurs. You have no dcubt\nlearned that the fine work of the world\nhas been done by looking closely.\n. Sometime your prejudices crystalize\ninto powerful motives and they guide\nyour life. Now the father of Elizabeth\nBarrett Browning is an illuminating il\nlustration of this type. You remember\nhe never forgave her for marrying\nRobert Browning. He was the victim\nof hi3 will. He would not read the let\nters his daughter sent him. He was a\nman with a will that had gone to seed.\nAre you able to find such a type in\nHays? -\nThe man of wills and not of will is\nvery amusing, but because he is trying\nto play so many parts he becomes\nreally tragic.\nIf you are not a man of will, and\nknow what you want in life after you\nhave reached fifty, and will take time\nto make a survey of self, you will find\nyou are nothing but a collection of old\nmasks. If you are not a master of\nyour will and a director of your desires,\nyou are nothing but a victim of the\nstrong willed that you meet along the\nway.\nTo some people life seems to be just\none stupid thing after another. Such\npeople give nothing, ask nothing, and\ntake nothing of life. Their eyes never\nsee anything. They may have a place\nin life\'s background, but- they never\nget to the front. It might be easy to\npersonally mention a number of names\nin Hays but I will not. You locate\nthem. .\nIf you ever read "Sentimental Tom\nmy" you will remember Tommy was a\nvictim of his moods and his environ\nment. Tommy never grew up. He\nnever became a person. He was a sort\nof a human chameleon. He always re\nflected his surroundings. You have\nmet such people. They always reflect\nthe last person they talked with. If\nyou will think about it, you will meet\nsuch folks in Hays. Do a little class\nifying and see how many you will find.\nNow the trouble with such people is\nthey have too many wills.\nYou may enjoy patriotic heart thrills,\nbut never, coin your enthusiasm into\nreal national feeling, thus making an\nefficient American. You may read Van\nDyke\'s poem, "America for Me," have\nreal joy thrills, throw up your dusty\nhat, shout and sing "My Country \'Tis\nof Thee," and then make as big a fool\nof self as Robert Casement. Some\npeople can die for their country so much\neasier than they can live for it. I am\nsure living for one\'s country just the\nslow process of living, coining the days\ninto character is a harder and better\nt lsk than under a flood of enthusiasm,\nmarching to roar of gun, and one day\ndie for the flag. It is so much harder\nyou know, to honestly live for our coun\ntry than to emotionally die for it.\nSmoky Hill Items.\n\' The farmers of Smoky Hill are still\nwaiting for a rain.\nThe Good Hope Music Club met at\nHiggins\' Tuesday \'afternoon.

The use of sugar, of\ncourse, is desirable in the canning of\nall kinds of fruits and makes a better\nand ready sweetened product.
