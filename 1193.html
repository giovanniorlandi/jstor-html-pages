The honor \nof doing this goes to \nE dmund Ruffin, whos~ \nfather having died in \nr8ro, was in r813, at \nthe age of 19, left in \ncharge of a large plantation\nat Coggin's Point, \nlocated in the tide \nwater area of Virginia. \nNot only because Edmund\nRuffin was the \nfirst man in America to \nput soil science to work, \nbut also because of the \npeculiar circumstances \nunder which this was \ndone, the speaker deems \nit appropriate to devote \na large portion of this \naddress to Ruffin 's \nwork. \nEdmund Ruffin, born \nin 1794, was in youth \nfrail of health and restless\nof spirit. He read \nmuch of whatever came \nto hand and grew up in \nalmost complete ignorance\nof the practical \nEDMUND RUFFIN (1794-1865) \nA successful farmer, father of soil chemistry\nin America, first to contend that up-\nland mineral soils in the humid region \nare often acid, foremost authority of his \ntime on the liming of land, brilliant writer, \npublic benefactor, and a great patriot. \n'Presidential address delivered before the thirty-first annual meeting of the \nSociety held in Washington, D. C ., November 17, 1938. \n'Professor of Soils, College of Agricul ture, University of Wisconsin, Madison, \nWis. \n973 \n", '974 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nagricultural tasks which now faced him. After some elementary \nschooling, probably by his parents or private tutors, he left home for \nthe first time at the age of 16 for Williamsburg to enter William and \nMary College. His career there was short, having met Susan Travis, \nhe soon returned home to take her in marriage, and then to enlist as \na private in the War of 1812. After six months of military routine, he \nwas mustered out, after which he immediately assumed control and \ndirection of the Coggin\'s Point farm. \nIn attempting to give you a picture of the state of agriculture in \nVirginia at the time Ruffin started farming, and of the problems that \nRuffin faced, I can do no better than to quote at length from Avery \nCraven\'s charming book entitled, Edmund Ruffin, Southernefl \n(pages 49 to 54). The quotation follows: \n"\'Of grain and pulse they provide commonly no more than they reckon that \ntheir families will require, for there are no towns as markets where they can sell \nthem .... The one thing of which they make as much as they can is tobacco, \nthere being always a vent for that at one time or another of the year.\' \n"Thus wrote an Old World observer of Virginia agricultural practices at the \nend of the seventeenth century. Unwittingly he had placed his finger on the central \nfact in the colonial history of the Old Dominion. Beginning in a wilderness, the \nearly settlers had faced the possibility of a rapid degeneration to a grinding \nsimplicity wherein every man and every group fashioned, from the materials the \nimmediate environment afforded, the sum total of their consumption. Only the \nfortunate development of a profitable surplus of tobacco prevented a rapid lowering\nof standards and enabled them to procure, by exchange with the Old World, \nthe comforts and luxuries of a mature and complex life and to reproduce in the \nforest a bit of \'merry England\' itself, \'transported across the Atlantic ... more \nmerry, light and joyous than England had ever thought of being.\' \n"But it led, also, to the elevation of the first of those despotic Southern kings \nwho brought so much of misery to their subjects. To base upon one staple alone, \nthe whole of a standard of living centuries too old for its environment meant the \nestablishment of a single-crop type of agriculture in which the sole object was \nimmediate great yields regardless of future consequences. Such a system, under \nfrontier scarcity of capital and labor, threw the burdens of abnormal production \nsquarely upon the land, in a region where sod formation was poor, rainfall heavy \nand concentrated, and the harmful microorganisms unusually active. There could \nbe but one result. Tobacco-growing meant soil exploitation, unit expansion, and \nultimate abandonment of once fertile fields. \n"Just what was implied is revealed in the comment of a second observer, \nthree-quarters of a century later. \'The Virginians of the lower country are very \neasy and negligent husbandmen,\' he wrote. \'New land is taken up, the best to be \nhad, tobacco is grown on it for three or four years and then Indian corn as long as \nany will come. And in the end, if the soil is thoroughly impoverished, they .begin \nagain with a new piece and go through the rotation.\' He pictured a world of widening\nfields and retreating forests; white servants, come to toil, giving way to negro \nslaves under pressure for economy; acres growing weary, falling from cultivation, \nand returning again to forest; in time, planters frayed a bit at the cuffs, out at the \nelbows, down at the heels, bitter and complaining, as farmers are wont to be, of \nreturns that did not pay the cost of production. And then, while some held on, \n3New York: D. Appleton and Company. 1932. \n', 'TRUOG: PUTTING SOIL SCIENCE TO WORK 975 \nshifting crops and yielding standards, others, more easily discouraged or more \nquick to accept the inevitable, according to the point of view, turned west, leaving \nthe bones of their ancestors to keep watch in old familiar neighborhoods while \nthey began over again where lands were fresh and cheap and debts were no disgrace.\n"Such a system, of necessity, ran its course in the older regions well before the \nAmerican Revolution. Many planters turned farmer, dividing their lands and \nlabor forces into smaller units, shifting production to wheat and corn, and seeking \nmarkets that lay outside the grip of the British merchant and his much despised \nScotch agents. But the Revolution interrupted adjustments, adding its ruin to an \nalready bad situation, which did not greatly improve for the masses until the \nFrench Revolution and its spread gave to the American farmers the profitable \ntask of furnishing food to those whose efforts were absorbed by war. A few great \nplanters, such as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, led the way to changes for \nthe better conservation of the soil, while such specialists as John Binns and John \nTaylor of Caroline preached a new gospel of fertilizers and crop rotation which \nwould have altered fundamentally the whole agricultural procedure. But uncertain\nprofits checked wide change, and the Peace of Ghent threw the whole old \ntobacco world back in ruins, sighing \'for another Napoleon to restore to us by his \nwars the feeding of Europe.\' \n"Thus, when Edmund Ruffin, just turned nineteen, took over the responsibilities\nof a planter on weary lands, the situation represented the accumulations of \ntwo centuries of bad methods. Plows and plowing were poor. Iron moldboards \nwere just coming into use, but the great majority, suspicious of anything new, \npreferred to go on with their old implements, cutting shallow furrows up and down \nthe hillsides to become veritable watercourses of destruction in time of rains. \nFurthermore, the rotation of crops, though followed by a few, met serious difficulties\nin the failure of clover or other legumes to grow on poor lands, which cut \nthe supply of livestock and manure and precluded the profits that would have \nmade possible the purchase of artificial fertilizers. Slaves multiplied out of proportion\nto agricultural needs, becoming a burden on masters and fields until the \nstrong paternal sense which characterized the institution in this region weakened \nto permit the sale of the human surplus into the spreading cotton fields of the \n\'Lower South.\' Tattered and briary, the lands lapsed back to become the haunts \nof deer and wild turkey, while stolid men and patient women plodded on with a \npersistence too mechanical to have been born of courage. Agriculture was steadily \nyielding ground in both a real and a figurative sense. \n"Travelers and natives alike in this period (1815-1830) agree on the impression \nthat an \'angel of desolation had cursed the land,\' many tracts presenting scenes of \nruin \'that baffle description-farm after farm ... worn out, washed and gullied, \nso that scarcely an acre could be found in a place fit for cultivation;\' \'dreary and \nuncultivated wastes, a barren and exhausted soil, half clothed negroes, lean and \nhungry stock, a puny race of horses, a scarcity of provender, houses falling to \ndecay, and fences wind shaken and dilapidated.\' \n"Meanwhile \'an emigrating contagion resembling an epidemic disease\' had \nseized the people. \'Thousands ... in the hopelessness of bettering their condition \nin their native land\' abandoned \'the beloved homes of their nativity.\' The rate of \npopulation growth in Virginia fell from thirty~seven and a half per cent in 1820 to \nthirteen and a half per cent in 1830 and then to only a trifle over two per cent in \nthe next decade. Many counties lost population, and there were over 388,ooo \nVirginians in other states in 1850. Ruffin himself later declared: \'There was scarcely \n', '976 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \na proprietor in my neighborhood ... who did not desire to sell his land, and who \nwas prevented only by the impossibility of finding a purchaser, unless at half of \nthe then very low estimated value. All wished to sell, none to buy.\' And what was \ntrue of lower Virginia applied with equal force to the older portions of Maryland \nand the Carolinas. The prospects for a young planter were, indeed, gloomy. \n"With an enthusiasm born of youth and theories developed from childhood \nreading, Ruffin assumed his task. His lands at Coggin\'s Point were extremely \npoor, \'the larger part not averaging more than ten bushels of corn per acre, no \nmore than six bushels of wheat, on the better half.\' From experiment to experiment\nhe moved, failure clogging his steps. He drained his better swamp lands only \nto find their yields, after three years of good crops, so reduced as to necessitate \nabandonment. He turned to John Taylor\'s much discussed system of \'enclosing,\' \nreceiving \'as sound and true every opinion and precept,\' but ended in \'utter disappointment.\'\nThe manure he applied \'produced little of the expected effect on \nthe first course of crops and was scarcely to be perceived on the second.\' Clover \nwould not grow for him, and \'the plowing on hilly land ... into ridges, caused \nthe most destructive washing away of soil by heavy rains.\' After four or five years \nof trial Taylor\'s methods \'proved either profitless, entirely useless or absolutely \nand in some cases greatly injurious.\' He was forced to admit that no part of his \n\'poor land was more productive than when ... (his) labors commenced and that \non much of it, a tenfold increase had been made of the previously large space of \ngalled and gullied hillsides and slopes.\' \n"Old residents, grown weary in the struggle, had long since concluded that lands \nin this part of the state could not hold manure or be enriched. They smiled in \ntolerance as the young theorist continued to reject this \'monstrous agricultural \nheresy\' but did not withhold the \'I told you so\' when at last he too \'was compelled, \nmost reluctantly, to concur in this opinion.\' He had failed. He would seek \'the \nrich western wilderness\' where his \'whole income and more\' would not be required \nfor the most economical support of his \'small but fast growing family.\' Not the \nlure of verdant fields in Kentucky or Alabama stirred him, but benumbing pressure\nweighing heavily on one who thought of the future in terms of children and \neven slaves who must have the things that a gentleman gives to his dependents.\'\' \nIn such a frame of mind Ruffin had the good fortune of having a \ncopy of Davy\'s Agricul ural Chen ist1 y, first published in r8r3, fall \ninto his hands. It was probably more thai! mere chance that this \nhappened, for Ruffin, in his intense zeal to find some solution to the \nbaffling problems of soil management that faced him, was apparently \ncombing all available sources of information. Although Ruffin states \nthat his limited knowledge of chemistry was obtained without aid or \ninstruction, his keen, analytical mind apparently made it possible \nfor him to master the contents of Davy\'s book in short order. His \nattention was particularly attracted to a statement to the effect that \na sterile soil containing "the salt of iron, or any acid matter. ... \nmay be ameliorated by the application of quicklime." \nIn Davy\'s book he found directions for testing soils for soluble iron, \ncalcium, and calcareous earth and also testing limestone and marl for \ntheir carbonate content. Ruffin immediately assembled the necessary \nequipment and chemicals for making these tests. Although he was not \nable to reveal the presence of free acids in his soil, he did show that \ncarbonates were absent, and having observed that sorrel and pine \n', 'TRUOG: PUTTING SOIL SCIENCE TO WORK 977 \nabounded on poor soil, he was led to the independent conclusion \nthat "vegetable acids" were the cause of sterility in his soils. Ruffin \nwas thus probably the first man in the whole world to conclude that \nupland mineral soils are often acid due to the presence of free acids, \nmade possible by the absence of calcareous earths. In defense of this \nconclusion, he presented arguments which were in advance of some \npresented by trained chemists nearly a century later. He observed for \nexample, that drainage waters from non-calcareous soils are often \ndarker in color than those from calcareous soils, due, he contended, \nto the solubility of the free organic acids and insolubility of the lime \nsalts of these acids. He also held that all fertile soils are either calcareous\nor hold lime in combination with acids in such form that it is \neasily extracted with hydrochloric acid. The thoroughness of Ruffin\'s \nconsideration of the subject is evidenced by his detailed reference to \nthe work on humic acids which Berzelius was doing at about that \ntime. He also refers to the work of Sprengel and others. \nAlthough litmus paper was used by the chemist as early as I8o7 to \ndetect acidity and alkalinity in the laboratory4 , yet Davy makes no \nmention of its use in testing soils. The earliest references to the use of \nlitmus paper for testing the reaction of soils that the writer has traced \nare one by Thaer5 in I 8 56 and one by V oelcker6 in I 86 5. One can well \nimagine the thrill Ruffin would have experienced had the litmus paper \ntest been available to him so that he might have given positive demonstration\nof the general prevalence of acidity in upland mineral soils \nof the humid region. At any rate, his conclusion that upland mineral \nsoils are often quite sterile due to an acid condition was essentially \ntrue. With the aid of the test for carbonates, Ruffin located deposits \nof marl on his farm and at other places in the neighborhood. He now \ndecided to make an actual test of his theory. Quoting again from \nAvery, page 55: \n"On a February morning in 18I8 his carts began to haul the marl that puzzled \nnegro hands dug from pits hastily opened on his lower lands. They spread some \ntwo hundred bushels over a few acres of newly-cleared, but poor, ridge land, and \nin the spring he planted the entire field to corn as a testing crop. Eagerly he waited. \nAs the season advanced, he found reason for joy. From the very start the plants \non marled ground showed marked superiority, and at harvest time they yielded \nan advantage of fully forty per cent. The carts went back to the pits. Fields took \non fresh life. A new era in the agricultural history of the region had dawned. \n"With all the ardor of a discoverer Ruffin immediately set about to widen his \nknowledge by extended experiments and to spread the information which offered \nso much to his fellow planters and to his section. In October of that year he presented\nto the agricultural society of his own county the first of what was to be a \nlong list of valuable papers offered to the cause of agriculture. Stating his theories \nas \'to the nature of soils and the action of calcareous manures\' on them, he adduced\nthe slender sum of his experience to support what was, in fact, a revolu-\ntionary approach to the whole problem that vexed the farmers of the New World. \nWhile the great rural hosts, facing westward, moved steadily forward to the ex4Die\nApotheker-Kunst, von Trommsdorff. 1807. \n5Principles of Agriculture, page 184, New York. 1856. \n6]our.

He would save the Old \nSouth. He would commit that greatest of all agricultural crimes-he would rely \non theory and books!" \nIn the language of my address tonight, he would put soil science to \nwork. Quoting further from Avery, page 56: \n"Three years later this paper, revised and enlarged, was published in the \nAmerican Farmer, the new agricultural journal that John Skinner had started \nin Baltimore. The editor hailed it as \'the first systematic attempt ... wherein a \nplain, practical, unpretending farmer has undertaken to examine into the real \ncomposition of the soils which he possesses and has to cultivate. So fundamental \ndid he consider the contribution that an extra edition of this issue was printed to \nbe distributed gratuitously to the farmers of the country. Eleven years later, \ngrown into a volume of 242 pages, it appeared again under the title, AN ESSAY ON \nCALCAREous MANURES, to run through five editions and to be called at the end of \nthe nineteenth century by a government expert, writing in the YEAR BOOK OF \nTHE UNITED STATES LEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, the most thorough piece of \nwork on a special agricultural subject ever published in the English language. \nContemporary writers, who have been lifting their jeremiads amid the agricultural\nruins and \'the draining off of our most independent citizens to the West,\' \nhailed him as a deliverer, taking rank at once with the great John Taylor of Caroline\nwhose ARATOR had been the first cry in the wilderness. Even the doors of \npolitics swung open to him, and in time a president of the United States would \ndeclare that his ESSAY \'in its valuable consequences\' would \'be worth more to the \ncountry than all the state papers that have been the most celebrated in our time.\' \nOver John Tyler\'s mantel Edmund Ruffin\'s portrait would hang as a companion \npiece to that of Daniel Webster-the greatest American agriculturist and the \ngreatest American statesman!" \nIn the light of this rather extended review of Edmund Ruffin\'s \nwork relative to scientific and practical soil management, I think you \nwill all agree that Edmund Ruffin, as Craven says, "has good claim \nto be called the father of soil chemistry in America". Some of you \nhave read George Washington\'s difficulties in the culture of alfalfa \nand, even, clover. Washington was thoroughly familiar with the \nagricultural writings of the foremost authorities in England of his \ntime. He was, in fact, in regular communication with no lesser \nauthority than ArthurYoung. It was impossible, however, for Washington\nto obtain much aid, even from the foremost authorities, be-\ncause soil chemistry was just being born at the time of his death in \n1799. Davy\'s writings on agricultural chemistry had, as yet, not \nappeared. \nWashington practiced erosion control to some extent, took special \npains to conserve animal manure, went to great labor in fertilizing \nwith mud obtained from creeks and marshes, and spent much money \nin the purchase of special seeds, nevertheless, he was unable to materially\nincrease production or even maintain the level of soil fertility. \nHad he known that his soil was acid and needed lime (the U.S. Soil \nSurvey map shows that the crop lands of Washington\'s Mount Vernon \n', 'TRUOG: PUTTING SOIL SCIENCE TO WORK 979 \nFarms consist largely of Keyport silt loam which lacks lime even \nunder virgin conditions), he undoubtedly would have applied the lime, \nand then clover and even alfalfa would have grown so that the nitrogen\nand organic matter supply of his land might have been main-\ntaine.d or increased. The use of lime would probably have deferred \nthe advent of failing crops by 2S to so years, that is, until phosphorus \nand potassium became limiting elements. The agricultural situation \nin r834, 3S years after Washington\'s death is expressed by Craven \n(page 63) as follows: \n"By 1834 a visitor to \'Mount Vernon,\' where the great Washington had struggled\nfor better methods, declared that \'a more wide-spread and perfect agricul-\ntural ruin could not be imagined.\' Jefferson at \'Monticello\' was closing his days in \npoverty as his fields and markets failed him; everywhere the agricultural societies \ndwindled for lack of support as farmers lost heart; and even John Binns and his \ngypsum yielded ground." \nIn order that he might give his discoveries relative to the use of \nlime greater publicity, and that better methods in agriculture might \nbe promoted, Ruffin in r833 launched his agricultural periodical \ncalled the Far ers\' R·gi t?r. This publication was called by John \nSkinner, a prominent editor, to be the "best publication on agriculture\nwhich this country or Europe has ever produced." \nRuffin also purchased another estate of nearly rooo acres of choice \nland in Hanover County, Virginia, which he appropriately called \n"Marlbourne". He had no sooner moved to this new estate in 1843, \nwhen he set to marling Soo acres or more in preparation for clover. \nHe installed a system of drainage, gave most careful attention to the \npreservation and use of barnyard manure, and persisted with his \ntrials until clover grew too rank for his machines to cut. The results \nof scientific farming were soon manifest, for in the period r84s to \nr848, his yields per acre of wheat increased from rs to 20 bushels, and \ncorn from 14 to 29 bushels. His profits on wheat alone for one year \nwere nearly $6,ooo. \nI would not have you believe that Ruffin was the first man in \nAmerica to use lime for we have definite reference that liming of land \nwas practiced to some extent in Colonial days, particularly in Pennsylvania\nand New Jersey. As is well known, history records definitely \nthat liming of land was practiced long before the Christian Era. Undoubtedly\nhere and there long before the dawn of history, man scat-\ntered ashes from his fire or marl from the pit, over land which he later \nplanted to crops and noted marked improvement in his harvest \ntherefrom. At another time and place he repeated the practice but \nthe results were not favorable. He knew not why for his results were \nempirical and there was no soil science which might be put to work. \nThus he dropped the practice as did others that followed him. By the \ntime of the Romans, however, there had accumulated a sufficient \nbody of favorable results from the liming of land that their writers \non agriculture were disposed to give the matter considerable prominence.\nIn Britain, the liming of land may have antidated the invasion \nby the Romans, since lime in the form of chalk and marl is there so \nplentiful. Hall states "The regular use of some form of lime or chalk \n', '980 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \nwas part of the accepted routine of farming as early as we possess any \nrecords of British agriculture, and among the manures it figures in all \nbooks of the 16th and 17th centuries." \nWhile the practice of liming land probably antidates all records of \nthe practice, nevertheless the idea that an acid condition of th.e soil \nis the principle factor involved in the liming of land is of rather recent \norigin. The early English writers, including Davy, ascribed the main \nbenefits of liming land to its influence on the physical condition of the \nsoil, while Leibig attributed the benefits more to the liberation of \nalkalies and silica from silicates. In 1849 a most excellent treatise by \nJohnston on liming of soils made its appearance in Britain. As far as \nthe writer has been able to determine, this is the first time that some \nother writer than Ruffin has given considerable prominence to the \naction of lime in neutralizing soil acids. \nDuring the last I 5 to 20 years of his life, Edmund Ruffin spent \nmuch of his time in the discussion of political and economic problems. \nHe was a strong advocate of slavery and fired the first gun at Fort \nSumter which precipitated the Civil War. He took an active part in \nseveral battles of the Civil vVar, and shortly after Lee\'s surrender, \nat the age of 71, feeling that he was now a man without a country, \nand too old and weary to be other than a burden to his children, he \nwith stern logic, caused a shot to ring out in order that he might join \nhis comrades who died in battle for a lost cause. \nUnfortunately, due to the confusion and disorganization wrought \nby the Civil War, Ruffin\'s writings relative to the use of calcareous \nmanures were largely forgotten and lost. The practice of liming, as \nfar as the South is concerned, seems to have largely ended for the \ntime being with the passing of Ruffin. It remained for H. ]. Wheeler \nin the closing years of the 19th century to revive the idea of the \ngeneral prevalence of acidity in upland mineral soils. By this time, \nthe use of litmus paper for the testing of soils had come into use, and \nWheeler, by means of this test, was able to demonstrate positively \nthat many upland mineral soils are distinctly acid and need lime. This \nwas the beginning of a sustained appreciation in this country of the \nneed and value of lime in agriculture. \nOver roo years have passed since Edmund Ruffin through painstaking\nwork and brilliant scientific achievement concluded that up-\nland mineral soils in the humid region often need lime because they \nare acid, and nearly so years have passed since H. ]. Wheeler gave \npositive demonstration to the general prevalence of soil acidity in upland\nmineral soils of the humid region, and still today, we are apply-\ning only a small fraction of the lime to soils that we should. Moreover,\ntoday we have tests of considerable refinement for determining \nthe lime needs of soils; lime or marl has been located in nearly every \nsection of the country where liming is needed; highly efficient machinery\nhas been devised for grinding limestone and digging marl; \npower for operating this machinery is abundant, facilities for transporting\nthe lime to the farm where needed have been developed be-\nyond the fondest hopes of 25 years ago; and finally we have data \nalmost without end showing that the use of lime is fundamental in the \nhumid region to the growth of legumes to nitrogen fixation, to a \n', 'TRUOG: PUTTING SOIL SCIENCE TO WORK \nfavorable availability of soil phosphates, and finally to soil conservation\nitself. We ride about the country and pass through sections \nwhere the eye meets out-crops of limestone in every direction, but \nalas, due principally to an acid condition of the soil, there are "no \nfields of alfalfa, sweet clover, or other high grade legumes which are \nso necessary for the creation of a land of "milk and honey". \nWhat is the answer to our dilemma? In a recent article the speaker \nwrote as follows :7 \nWhy did Kentucky, in 1936, use the equivalent of 124 pounds of lime oxide per \nacre of crop land and Tennessee only 8~ pounds, and similarly, in the same year, \nWisconsin 64 pounds and Michigan only 14 pounds? The climate, need of lime, \nand natural supplies of lime in the pairs of States compared are quite similar. All \nof these States have extension services which for a long time have been offering \ninformation on the subject through demonstrations, publications, and lectures. \nEvidently that method alone will not do the job. Until the extension services are \nable to form some connection with a large-scale organization, either private or \ngovernmental, that can be depended upon to furnish the farmer this basic and \nfundamental soil-building material-lime-at a reasonably low price, or some \nother equally effective method is found and adopted, permanent soil improvement\nand soil conservation will remain, to a large degree,· "a pot of gold at the end \nof the rainbow". \nCheap lime for short periods made possible by emergency measures \nwill alone, however, not bring about permanently the kind of a liming \nprogram that is needed. The agronomists must do their part. The \nagronomists must take a positive stand. The agronomists must put \nsoil science to work. They must speak in terms of the general rule \nrather than in terms of the exception. Too often in the past when the \nfarmer has asked-point blank-"will it pay me to use lime?", the \nagronomist has retreated to his first-line trenches consisting of a \ncamouflage of garbled scientific or other high-sounding "triplethreat"\nwords, something like this-"W ell, you know the soil is a \ncomplicated physico-chemico-biologico system made up of mineral \nand organic material some of which is in colloidal condition, and all \nof which is infested or populated with myriads of both beneficial and \ndetrimental organisms too small to see. Just what lime will do to these \ncolloids and organisms, I am not quite sure. It might cause what the \nsoil biologist now calls \'a sit down strike\' on the part of the organisms,\nor what the soil chemist calls \'a slow-up strike\' on the part of \nthe soil colloids. I tell you what you do. Get a few bushels of lime and \nspread it on a few square rods of your field, and then if th~ crop increase\nis sufficient to pay for the lime and leave a profit, then it will \npay you to use lime." \nAfter the agronomist has effected this retreat, what does the farmer \ndo? He also retreats and does exactly what you would do under similar\ncircumstances, namely, he does as in the past, he does not use lime. \nHow should the agronomist meet a situation fraught with a few \nspecial or exceptional cases? Here is Ruffin\'s answer: 8 \n7U. S. Yearbook of Agriculture, page 564. 1938. \n8Calcareous Manures, ed. 2, page 53. 1832. \n', '982 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \n"There are many practices universally admitted to be beneficial-yet there are \nnone, which are not found sometimes, useless or hurtful, on account of some other \nattendant circumstance, which was not expected, and perhaps not discovered. \nEvery application of calcareous manures to soil, is a chemical operation on a great \nscale: decompositions and new combinations are produced, and in a manner \ngenerally conforming to the operators expectations. But other and unknown \nagents may sometimes have a share in the process, and thus cause unlooked for \nresults. Such differences between practice and theory have sometimes occurred in \nmy use of calcareous manures (as may be observed in some of the reported experiments)\nbut they have neither been frequent, uniform, nor important." \nAnd again quoting from Avery, page 63, here is a sample of what \nRuffin accomplished 100 years ago, without any expense to the taxpayer,\nby preaching the philosophy of the rule rather than the philoso-\nphy of the exception . \n. . "From 1838 to 1850 the land values of tidewater Virginia increased by over \nseventeen millions of dollars, and one estimate placed the total increase from the \napplication of marl, after 1820, at over thirty millions. One writer, evidently carried\naway by his own eloquence, declared that \'Mother earth has changed her face, \nand ... her constitution under the healing influence of this salutary medicament, \nand now presents an appearance as different from her former self, as the healthy \nand robust man from the lingering and hectic victim of consumption.\' \'Verdant \nfields,\' \'luxuriant clover,\' and \'abundant harvests\' had taken the place of \'broomstraw\nand poverty grass,\' while a poor, thin, and stunted vegetation had \'dis-\nappeared.\'" \nFarmers and even agronomists often say that liming of land is too \nexpensive. Well, how expensive is it? Since a ton of ground limestone, \ncosting in some North Central States approximately $2 will balance \nthis loss for a period of 5 to 10 years, the annual cost per acre becomes \n20 to 40 cents. Data from experiments and demonstrations are at \nhand, almost without end, showing that this cost is insignificant \ncompared to the increased production and the soil improvement that \nresult. \nAnd here again is what Ruffin says relative to the cost of liming \nland: 9 \n"We never calculate the cost of any old practice. We are content to clear woodland\nthat afterwards will not pay for the expense of tillage .. , But let any new \npractice be proposed, and then every one begins to count its cost-and on such \nerroneous premises, that if applied to every kind of farm labor, the estimate \nwould prove that the most fertile land known, could scarcely defray the expenses \nof its cultivation.\'\' \nIn developing the subject of my talk this evening, I have spoken \nlargely of matters pertaining to liming of land. This method of approach\nwas adopted because that phase of the subject has the richest \nhistorical background. What has just been said relative to the agronomists\nduty in promoting the use of lime applies also to the use of \nfertilizers, to the furthering of soil conservation, a~d the adoption of \n• Ibid, page 61. \n', 'TRUOG: PUTTING SOIL SCIENCE TO WORK \nproper land use programs. We agronomists must all adopt a more. \nincisive and positive attitude in promoting sound and. practical \nprograms of soil management. \nBefore closing, I wish to speak of one more phase of the subject, \nnamely, that having to do with soil testing and the use of fertilizers. \nI believe it is safe to say that soil and lime testing, crude as it was, is \nwhat made possible Ruffin\'s monumental work in the field of soil \nacidity, liming, and soil management. During the early years of the \n19th century, soil testing was well on its way to becoming a powerful \ntool in diagnosing the needs of sick soils, as is evidenced by the following\nquotations: \nIn 1813, Sir Humphry Davy wrote in his "Elements of Agricultural \nChemistry\'\', as follows: \n"If land be unproductive, and a system of ameliorating it is to be attempted, \nthe sure method of obtaining the object is by determining the cause of its sterility, \nwhich must necessarily depend upon some defect in the constitution of the soil, \nwhich may be easily discovered by chemical analysis." \nFifty-two years later, Dr. August Voelcker10 wrote as follows: \n"There was a time when I thought, with many other young chemists, that soilanalyses\nwould do everything for the farmer, three or four years of further experi-\nence and hard study rather inclined me to side with those men who consider that \nthey are of no practical utility whatever; and now, after eighteen years of continued\noccupation with chemico-agricultural pursuits and, I trust, with more \nmatured judgment, I have come to the conclusion that there is hardly any subject \nso full of practical interest to the farmer as that of the chemistry of soils,-the \nlonger and more minutely soil-investigations are carried on by competent men, \nthe greater, I am convinced, will be their practical utility." \nFollowing these early successful attempts at soil testing, there \ndeveloped during the latter years of the 19th century, a school of \nthought which held that practically no information of value relative \nto the lime and fertilizer needs of a soil can be obtained by means of \nsoils tests. This thought arose largely, I believe, because too much \nwas expected at once of a tool in its early years of development, \nwhen too little was known of the forms in which plant nutrients exist \nin soils, of how the readily available constituents may be extracted \nand determined easily, and finally of the influence of secondary \nfactors such as the minor plant nutrients. Unfortunately this thought \nstill persists in the minds of many agronomists. If soil testing was \npracticable in Davy\'s, Ruffin\'s, and Voelcker\'s time, it should be \neven more practicable today when so much more is known relative \nto the many factors involved. \nFollowing the abandonment of soil testing, for the most part, there \ndeveloped a mania during the first quarter of the 2oth century for \nthe establishment of long-time field experiments. The speaker would \nnot have you think that he does not believe in field experiments \nand field demonstrations. These field experiments are useful and \nnecessary in establishing sound general principles of soil management.\nThat is, principles, which can only be established by noting the \n10See footnote 6, page 129. \n', '984 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRONOMY \n.influence of specific treatments over a long period of years. They \nare not adapted, however, for determining the lime and fertilizer \nneeds of a specific soil because these needs vary from field to field on \nthe same farm and even in different parts of the same field. Many field \ndemonstrations are of course needed to help convince farmers of the \nvalue of certain practices. \nI do not wish to leave the impression that I believe chemical soil \ntests are infallible. They are, of course, not. However, after 25 years \nof continuous experience with soil tests, I am convinced that with \nfurther study and improvement they will in time be generally used by \nall agronomists in diagnosing the lime and fertilizer needs of soils \ndevoted to practical agriculture. I envisage a time in the near future \nwhen conditions and the supply of plant nutrients in soils devoted to \nintensive culture will be controlled by means of tests, much like similar\nmatters are controlled in a chemical factory. Then, and only then, \ncan we say that we are putting chemical soil science fully to work in a \npractical way. In the case of long-time field experiments, soil tests \nshould be applied, from time to time, to determine the influence of \nany specific treatment on the level of fertility. The results of these \nsoil tests may in certain cases suggest a change in the rate of lime or \nfertilizer application so as to keep the experiment on a practical basis. \nSimilarly, in practical farming, soil tests serve as an indispensable \nguide in telling whether or not the returns to a soil are meeting the \nremoval under a specific system of fertilization and cropping. \nSome agronomists become greatly disturbed when fertilizer applied\non the basis of soil tests does not give sufficient crop increase \nthe first year to pay for the fertilizer. They seem to forget the allimportant\nlong time benefit, namely, that of maintenance of soil \nfertility which is the backbone of soil conservation, for, fertile soils \nsoon produce a protective cover of vegetation, which, for the most \npart, is the best preventive of soil erosion. \nIt is the duty of all agronomists to preach the doctrine that the \nmajor plant nutrient elements removed from the soil by crops must \nbe returned, pound for pound, in the form of crop residues, animal \nmanure, or commercial fertilizers, if soil fertility is to be maintained. \nAny other policy has in the past led to and will in the future lead to, \nfirst, soil depletion, then, soil destruction by erosion, and finally, \neconomic ruin. To take more out of a soil than is returned, is as certain\nto deplete a soil in time as the removal of money from a checking \naccount at a greater rate than its return is of putting the checking \naccount "in the red". \nCan farmers be sold on the philosophy of returning as much to the \nsoil as is removed? This philosophy is so simple and so sound that \nfarmers can be induced to accept it more easily than some of the \nmake-shift or stop-gap philosophies. During the early years of the \npresent century, Dr. C. G. Hopkins of Illinois preached this philosophy\nin a positive manner, and, in a short time, sold it so thoroughly \nthat today, 20 years after his passing, many farmers because of his \npersonal influence are still following it. \nIn general, what policy do many agronomists follow relative to \nthis matter? I size it up about as follows: As long as crop yields are \n', 'TRUOG: PUTTING SOIL SCIENCE TO WORK 985 \nfairly good and lime and fertilizer do not produce striking results, \nthe farmer is told that the addition of lime and fertilizer is not urgent \nor needed. Thereupon the farmer spends his spare cash for farm machinery,\nautomobiles, and even speculative securities. Time moves \non, and crop yields decline, as they must, and reach a lower than cost \nof production level, even before the arrival of the impending economic \ndepression. Then the depression breaks with all of its fury, and the \nfarmer aged and weary retires and bequeaths to his son the farm, but, \nwithout the soil, without any capital, and without a legacy of information\nand training relative to maintenance of soil fertility and soil \nconservation. Under these circumstances, only an Edmund Ruffin \nsucceeds. Unfortunately, Edmund Ruffins are not born everyday, \nand thus, in many cases it becomes necessary for the government to \nrehabilitate both the farm and the farmer. \nWill this cycle of soil depletion and agricultural desolation be \nrepeated, over and over, indefinitely? If the answer is to be no, then \nit will be necessary for the agronomist not only to take soil science \nfrom the sequestered cloister of the laboratory and hitch it to the \nplow, but also to go forth preaching a positive and realistic program \nof soil management and conservation as Edmund Ruffin did over roo \nyears ago. \n(N.B.
