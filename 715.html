She did so because in that text all the German\npassages were printed in the Gothic alphabet, and\nshe wanted us all to learn to read it easily. While\nI don\'t recall the book containing anything politically\nobjectionable, it was distinctly differ-\nent from the more "modern" foreign language textbooks\nthen coming into favor. Instead of following\nsome young American around on his clean-cut, faintly\nromantic adventures (and I say "his" in the specific,\nnot the generic sense, because the central character\nwas invariably male), we read animal fables\nand snippets of 19th century poetry. We learned a\nconsiderable vocabulary for birds and beasts, woods\nand meadows, weather and the animal cares of the\nbarnyard. I remember experiencing a distinct shock\none day when my teacher brought in a German women\'s\nmagazine, a rather elegant, glossy affair with exquisite-looking\nmodels. I was shocked to realize,\nfirst that living people used this language at all;\nand second, that the people who used it certainly\ndid not look like the trolls, woodcutters and peasants\nI had grown accustomed to. Now obviously, as\na reasonably intelligent fifteen-year-old I knew,\nrationally at least, that Germany was a modern industrial\nnation and so on. But the shock I exper-\nienced was real nevertheless, and the memory of\nit is vivid in me still, because the subliminal\nmessage of six months\' study with that text had been\nso powerful.\nThus when feminists in the early 70s began to\nlook at textbooks with a newly raised consciousness\nand to object to the unwelcome lessons such textbooks\ntaught, their arguments made eminently good\nsense to me. However, in the foreign languages as\nin other disciplines, the feminist critique of traditional\nmethods and materials has changed and evolved\nover the last decade, becoming increasingly more\nsophisticated and sensitive to more subtle problems\nof imbalance, more inclusive of feminist\nideals. The evolution of a feminist perspective in\n85\n', "foreign language teaching has not occured in isolation\nbut rather has developed in partnership with\nwomen's studies scholarship across the liberal arts,\nand it is this evolution of feminist thinking about\nforeign language instruction that I would like to\ntrace in this paper. Three phases can be distinguished\nin this development:  at first, a primary fo-\ncus on images of women and girls in textbooks ; then a\nbroadening of concern to include women's place in\nthe target culture; and finally, a critical look\nat the very language itself that we are teaching and\nat the value judgments which inform our decisions\nto include or exclude certain semantic and syntactic\npossibilities. Or we can describe this development\nanother way. That is, the attention of feminists has\nshifted from issues of sexism and bias (or negative\ntreatment of women) to equity (or a more positive\nrevaluation of women's roles, particularly in culture)\nto a profound rethinking of what we teach and\nhow. In any case, since our problems with textbooks\neven at the simplest level are far from solved, each\nof these successive phases has not supplanted but\nrather supplemented earlier concerns.\nThe first phase of feminist concern with teaching\nmaterials began around 1970 and peaked in 1977\nor '78. During this period numerous books and articles\nappeared, in everything from the popular\npresses to highly specialized professional journals,\ndetailing the discriminatory treatment of girls and\nwomen in standard teaching materials and arguing\nthat this bias worked to the disadvantage of male as\nwell as female students. Education, after all, was\nsupposed to expand the individual's options for personal\ndevelopment, not constrict them; rigid stereo-\ntyping, however, limited everyone's choices. Feminists\nwithin professional societies began to form\ncaucuses, and at regional and national conferences\nthey organized sessions devoted to the problem of\nsexist bias in their teaching materials. These\nsessions drew heavy attendance and sometimes even\nreceived press coverage. Checklists were developed\nto help everyone from the individual instructor to\nan entire school district in the assessment of bias.\nThe checklists produced data that could be used in\na number of ways.Â· the data helped schools and departments\nto decide for or against purchase of cer-\ntain texts; it indicated clearly to teachers where\nthey must compensate when faced with an objection-\n86\n", "able text; and it could be used by parents and teachers\nwhen they wrote letters of protest to publishing\nhouses. Publishers, in response to pressure both within\ntheir organizations and in the marketplace, issued\nguidelines designed to help authors and editors avoid\noffensive treatment not only of women and girls, but\nalso of minorities and disadvantaged groups such as\nthe elderly or handicapped.\nDuring this period, work in foreign language\ncircles paralleled the work done across the entire\nspectrum of American education, from kindergarten\nthrough post-secondary schooling and in many different\ndisciplines.  It was significant and valuable\nwork because it helped to translate the issue of\nbias into the specific idiom of the foreign language\nclassroom. Feminist efforts affected the high\nschool, but they tended to concentrate on the college\nlevel and to have a special urgency there: because\nso much foreign language instruction in this country\ntakes place at colleges and universities; because\nforeign language curricula tend to be more heavily\nenrolled by women than men; and because foreign language\ncompetency is traditionally an essential compon-\nent of a liberal arts education. For language instructors,\nfeminism in the academy meant not theory or\nresearch but rather practical actions that would enable\nthem to better serve both their students and the\neducational ideals of their institutions. The talks\nthat were delivered on sexism and bias, the articles\nthat were published and the checklists that were developed\n-- all reflect a basic concern with practical\napplication.\nBefore we can review foreign language teachers'\ncritiques of existing materials and their  recommendations,\nhowever, we need to clarify what it is that\nforeign language textbooks are supposed to accomplish.\nEven this attempt at clarification, however,\ndemonstrates how closely interwoven, indeed almost\ninextricable, necessary and gratuitous lessons may\nbe. A foreign language textbook -- at least the sort\nin common use in this country -- has two basic\nfunctions to fulfill: first, it must teach the target\nlanguage itself; and second, it must teach something\nof the culture or cultures in which that language\nis used.\nTeaching the target language means teaching\n8 7\n", 'grammar, vocabulary and usage. Grammatical phenomena\nare not really open to much discussion, although of\ncourse definitions of what is grammatically acceptable\ncan and do change over time when a need arises.\nMany grammatical phenomena involve either natural or\ngrammatical gender. One obvious example is gendermarking,\nwhich is far more pervasive in the commonly\ntaught foreign languages than it is in English. The\nfact that gender-marking occurs in a language does\nnot in itself constitute sexist bias; it is simply a\ngrammatical necessity. However, foreign language\ntextbooks have tended to introduce masculine forms\nfirst, to present feminine forms as deviations or\nderivatives of the masculine form, and to use masculine\nforms far more frequently in examples or drills.\nThese and similar practices do represent bias.\nWhen students learn vocabularly, they inevitably\nlearn feminine and masculine pronouns, nouns and\nadjectives to describe female and male persons, appropriate\ntitles and the names of various occupations.\nSometimes the presence or absence of a word in the\ntarget language\'s lexical system reflects longstanding\nassumptions about women and men, just as in\nEnglish we have "career woman" but no "career man"\n(except in the specialized context of the armed\nforces) and "family man" but no "family woman." Other\nwords, for example those describing physical\'appearance\nor personality, may be neutral in themselves\nbut become problematic because of the context in\nwhich they are repeatedly used. Occupations may be\ntaught in the masculine or feminine form according\nto stereotypical notions of appropriate male and\nfemale employment -- either on the whim of the author\nor because the non-traditional form simply does not\nexist.\nAnd third, students are supposed to learn\nusage -- what is idiomatic and"sounds good" in the\ntarget language. In this instance we are dealing with\na question of linguistic habit, of preference, rather\nthan with the basic grammatical structure of the\nlanguage itself. For example, a language may prefer\none past tense over another in normal conversation.\nSimilarly, there is a tendency in the commonly\ntaught European languages to use masculine forms\nnot only specifically but generically, to stand for\nall human beings, female and male alike. Because\ngender-marking is more pervasive in these languages\n', 'than it is in English, the cumulative effect of this\ngeneric masculine is even more devastating than it\nis in English. Yet usage, like vocabulary and even more\nthan grammar, is also susceptible to change when the\nneed arises.\nThe second basic function of a foreign language\ntextbook is to teach culture. The book may teach\nelite culture: the "great" individuals and "high\npoints" of the nation\'s historical or artistic tradition.\nOr the book may teach everyday culture: the\ncustoms, assumptions, values and amusements of\neveryday life. Most foreign language textbooks today\nteach a combination of the two. Textbooks teach culture\nin two ways: explicitly, in reading passages,\ndialogues, and other texts that convey information\nwhile illustrating specific linguistic phenomena; and\nimplicitly or subliminally. These implicit or subliminal\nmessages can be sent in a variety of ways. For\nexample, the very mix of materials that are included\nor excluded will shape students\' impressions of\nwhat is important or inconsequential in the target\nculture. Attitudes or information may be conveyed\nin sections of the textbook that ostensibly serve\nother purposes, such as grammar exercises or games\nand activities. And personality traits, value judgments\nor the behavior of characters in the text, if\nleft unremarked, may well be interpreted by the\nstudent as typical or at least acceptable.\nThus, when a couple of authors sit down to write\na textbook, they face myriad decisions which are at\nonce both practical and ideological. Beginning in\nthe early 1960s, with the popularization of an\naudio-lingual approach to language teaching, authors\nand publishers devoted a good deal of thought to\nmethod; the philosophical implications of these textbooks\nwent largely unchallenged, however, until 1974.\nIn that year, at the annual meeting of the American\nAssociation of Teachers of German held in the Federal\nRepublic, Anneliese Sartori-Stein delivered a talk\nentitled "Kultureller Chauvinismus im GrammatikDrill."!\nIn it, she identified a number of "chauvin-\nisms" and prejudicial attitudes that she had observed\nin German textbooks published in the US. The\nbooks tended to focus on West Germany to the exclusion\nof other German speaking countries, particularly\nthe German Democratic Republic. They assumed conflict\nbetween students and instructors and por-\n89\n', 'trayed students as lazy, instructors as boring\ndisciplinarians. They perpetuated a variety of\nnational clichÃ©s, and they reinforced the notion that\nGerman was a particularly difficult language. In\ntheir pages most social classes were ignored, except\nfor an educated upper-middle class of surgeons, professors\nand businessmen.\nLast but certainly not least, Sartori-Stein\ncriticized the treatment of women in the seventeen\ntextbooks she examined. She found an obsession with\nwomen\'s physical appearance, whereas men tended to be\ndescribed in terms of their profession or their intelligence.\nWomen were repeatedly stereotyped as\ngossipy busybodies, over-anxious mothers or fanatical\nhousekeepers. Unmarried women were portrayed as above\nall interested in finding a husband. Even if a woman\nworked outside the home, that work took second place\nto her marital status and domestic responsibilities.\nHowever, Sartori-Stein argued that German men in\nthese texts also suffered from sex stereotyping. They\nwere pressed into the role of stern, authoritarian\npater familias, reckless driver or helpless child in\nneed of mothering. In closing, Sartori-Stein called\nupon teachers to be sensitive to such bias, to teach\n"against" the text, and to demand that publishers\npay more attention to the content of their texts.\nOtherwise, she warned, German teachers stood to lose\nthe next generation of students, a more sophisticated\nand critical generation that would be repelled by the\nperpetuation of blatant cultural clichÃ©s and prejudices.\nAt the Central States Conference on Foreign\nLanguage Education the following year, Betty Schmitz\nlooked at "Sexism in French Language Textbooks" and\ndeveloped the four categories of bias -- exclusion,\nsubordination, distortion and degradation -- that\nhave proven so useful-in evaluations of teaching\nmaterials since then.  The category of exclusion includes\nboth invisibility and underrepresentation of\nwomen and girls. It refers to the proportion of a\nbook\'s contents devoted to females and males, and it\ncan be applied to virtually all the sections of a\nstandard textbook. In other words, in looking at\neverything from dialogues, readings, comprehension\nquestions and recombination materials to grammar\nexplanations, exercises, pattern drills and illustrations\n, we can ask whether there are as many females\nas males, whether feminine pronouns occur as often\n90\n', 'as masculine ones, and whether generic masculine repeatedly\nrenders the women in mixed groups invisible.\nLooking at the situation in 1975, Schmitz found that\nmale characters outnumbered females by a ratio of 3\nor 4 to 1; in illustrations, there were more than\ntwice as many male central figures as female central\nfigures.\nSubordination refers to the tendency, again in\nall contexts, to portray women in a position of inferiority\nor dependency vis-Ã -vis the men in the\ntextbook. When women are present, are they limited to\nsupporting roles, or do they also figure as main\ncharacters with prestigious jobs? Are women shown\noutside of the domestic setting, or do we meet them\nas the wives, mothers or romantic interests of male\ncharacters? When professions are taught, are women\nportrayed in the same wide range of jobs as men, from\nlow-paid ones to very prestigious ones? Schmitz\nasked these questions, and the answers were dismaying.\nShe concluded that the analysis of the roles of\nwomen in the textbooks greatly qualified the original\nstatistics on their presence. When women were present\nat all, they were limited to low-paid work. They\nappeared as stewardesses, nurses, secretaries, mothers,\nor nothing at all.\nBy distortion, Schmitz meant the stereotyping of\nintellectual abilities, personal characteristics,\nphysical appearance, social status, domestic roles,\nprofessional ambitions and other factors according\nto sex. Male/female stereotyping, she observed,\noften took the form of complementary behavioral opposities.\nThus men might be presented as active, in-\ndependent and strong while women appeared as passive,\ndependent and emotional. When Schmitz analysed the\nbehavior exhibited by male and female characters in\ndialogues, readings and illustrations, and noted the\ndescriptive adjectives used to refer to men and to\nwomen, she found marked sex-role stereotyping. Female\ncharacters were valued for their looks, while male\ncharacters were valued for their intelligence or\nskill. Males solved problems, gave help, travelled,\nparticipated in sports, engaged in conversations\nranging from the trivial to the serious, used initiative\nand made plans or gave suggestions. Females, by\ncomparison, solicited help rather than giving it,\nparticipated in social activities, performed routine\nand repetitive tasks such as shopping and self-care,\n91\n', 'engaged in trivial conversation, depended on others\nand expressed emotion or feeling.\nThe category of degradation, finally, referred\nto condescending statements or derogatory generalizations\nmade about women, Schmitz examined French text-\nbooks to see whether they contained examples of culturally\ncondoned antifeminist attitudes or "girl-\nwatching." She found women were not only excluded,\nreduced to subordinate roles, and portrayed in a distorted\nmanner, but also subjected to degrading state-\nments. Female characters were often perceived as unpleasant\nif they were too intelligent and an incon-\nvenience if they were stupid or flighty. In analysing\na textbook, Schmitz recommended that the reviewer be\non the alert for statements that refer to women as: a\ndanger or useless complication; bitchy, meddlesome,\nor manipulative; usually late or otherwise irresponsible;\nillogical, emotional, inept, or too intelli-\ngent for their own good; silly, stupid, childish or\n"cute"; and valued primarily for looks.\nIn closing, Schmitz was careful to explain that\nshe was not recommending textbooks be revised to present\nan artificial statistical equality; nor should\nthe cultural accuracy of male and female roles in\nvarious societies be violated. She argued,"It would\nbe ridiculous to show 50 percent women students at\nthe Ã‰cole Polytechnique. But it would not be ridiculous\n~ÎŽÃ¶~ÎŽÃ±cÎŠÎ›mÃ«~ÎŠi~rrÃ«aSÎ• Ï„lg  about the first woman ad-\nmitted to the Ecole Polytechnique, or the first woman\npilot in France." She called for textbooks that would\nreflect the variety of real life, instead of perpetuating\nstereotypes and attitudes that limited the\npersonal development of both female and male students\nTo help remedy the existing situation, she recommended\nteacher awareness training: workshops to show\nteachers how to compensate for racism and sexism in\nteaching materials; pressure on school boards to\nreview current or prospective teaching materials for\nsexist and racist bias; and writing letters to authors\nand publishers.\nAlthough it was not one of the main points in\nher talk, Betty Schmitz implied that sexism in teaching\nmaterials was undesirable because it interfered\nwith an accurate presentation of French women and\nmen\'s lives. This argument was greatly strengthened\nwith the appearance in 1977 of ThÃ©rÃ¨se Bonin and\n92\n', 'Judith Muysken\'s excellent article, "French Women inLanguage Textbooks: Facts or Fiction?"3 The first half\nof the article described the way women were typically\nportrayed in French language textbooks. In the second\nhalf of the article, this picture of French women was\nunmasked as a fiction having precious little correlation\nto the actual educational status, employment\nrates, self-image or aspirations of French women and\ngirls. Backed up by data from several surveys and\ninformation agencies, Bonin and Muyskens delivered\na devastating critique, scoring textbooks for their\ngross inaccuracy. The obvious  conclusion to be drawn\nfrom their work, not only for French but for all foreign\nlangauge teaching, was that teaching materials\nshould provide a statistically accurate picture of\nthe target culture as it really was, and not as authors\nor students might like to have it. (It is in-\nteresting to note, however, that only a few years\nlater the same argument was used by retrenching publishers\nagainst feminists demanding less stereotyped\ntreatment of women.)\nConference activity during this period continued\nto focus regularly on issues of sexism and bias. In\n1976 and \'77 the Coalition of Women in German, a feminist\ncaucus and allied organization of the AATG and\nMLA, held special sessions at the AATG national conventions.\nAt the 1977 session Ruth Sanders andAudrone\nWilleke gave a presentation, later published under\nthe title "Walter ist intelligent und Brigitte ist\nblond,"4 which accomplished for German textbooks\nwhat Betty Schmitz had accomplished for French ones.\nIn addition, however, Sanders and Willeke suggested\nspecific compensatory strategies which teachers could\nuse to counter the four categories of bias originally\ndefined by Schmitz. As a constructive approach\nto exclusion, for example, they suggested addition\nor substitution of reading materials which offered\npositive female role models or raised issues of\nspecial concern to women. To counteract subordination\nof women, they proposed class discussion and role\nreversal in dialogues. When the textbook conveyed\ndistorted images of women and men, Sanders and Willeke\nfound it useful to personalize generalizations\nand to develop students\' critical awareness with\ncarefully prepared questions; they took the same\napproach with degrading or hostile generalizations.\nIn grammar presentations, they recommended varying\nthe order in which neuter, feminine or masculine\nnoun forms were taught; and they noted lexical items\n93\n', 'that could appropriately serve as points of departure\nfor a discussion of generic masculine or non-parallel\ntreatment of women.\nAt the 1978 meeting of the Central States Conference,\nBetty Schmitz updated her analysis and\nfound a marked improvement in the portrayal of female\ncharacters, as well as inclusion of more women-\nrelated materials.-Â· At the 1979 SAMLA conference,\nFrancine Frank and Helen Frink delivered a jpint paper,\n"Sexism in Foreign Language Textbooks,"  in\nwhich they examined French, Spanish and German texts.\nAlthough they, too, saw signs of progress, they concluded\nthat full equality was still a long way off.\nIronically, attempts to correct sexism could also\ncreate new problems. For example, Frank and Frink\nnoted that many new books were beginning to include\npassages on the status of women; but in some cases the\nsubject was not taken seriously, and even in the best\nof cases treatment was little more than tokenism.1\nMoreover, as feminists were beginning to realize, isolation\nof information about women in a single passage\nor chapter contributed to the impression that women\nand women\'s issues were unrelated to the "mainstream"\nof cultural history or everyday life. Betty Schmitz,\nin fact, subsequently developed an analytical category\nfor this problem which she called "Fragmenta-tion/Isolation. "Â° Frank also noted that even without\novert sex stereotyping or degradation, many textbooks\nreflected an overwhelmingly masculine world, where\nonly the activities and concerns of men were important.\nBesides surveying sexism in foreign language\ntextbooks, Frank and Frink distributed a checklist\nthey had developed for identifying sex bias. This\nchecklist, like the "Suggested Guidelines for Detecting\nSexism in French Language Textbooks" distributed\nby Betty Schmitz at her talk in 1975, called for\nboth quantitative and qualitative analysis of textbooks.\nThe textbook reviewer was asked to count the\nnumber of male and female figures, the number of\nmasculine and feminine pronouns that occurred in all\nsections of the book, and to determine the percentage\nor ratio of men to women. Male and female characters\nwere to be analysed and tabulated according to profession,\nbehavior, setting in which they appeared\nand adjectives used to describe them. Both grammar\nsections and vocabulary were to be examined for a\npreponderance of masculine forms, for habitual pre-\n94\n', 'cedence of masculine forms, or for the relegating of\nfeminine forms to stereotypical contexts. Derogatory\nstatements about women could be recorded and numbered\nThese evaluative instruments and others like them\nwere shared via feminist networks all over the United\nStates and helped to sustain the momentum for change.\nDuring this same period, publishing houses began\nto respond to the feminist critique of their pro-\nducts.  Scott, Foresman and Company led the field,\nissuing its own in-house guidelines in 1972 and 1974.\nThey were followed in 1975 by Ginn and Company, Holt,\nRinehart and Winston, Houghton Mifflin, Macmillan,\nMcGraw-Hill and Prentice-Hall. Norton adopted the\nMcGraw-Hill guidelines. After this explosion of concern\na few more companies climbed aboard, including\nHarper and Row (1976), Holt\'s college department\n(1976), Random House (1976), Southwestern Publishing\nCo. (1976), and John Wiley and Sons (1977). Since\nthen, Richard D. Irwin has issued undated guidelines,\nand in 1981, Houghton Mifflin revised its guidelines,\nchanging the name of the document, significantly\nenough, from Avoiding Stereotypes to Eliminating\nStereotypes.\nThus it would appear that by the late \'70s the\nproblem had essentially been solved. School boards\nhad learned to count pronouns, teachers had learned\ncompensatory strategies, authors had been chastized\nand editors were busy planning non-sexist revisions.\nBut was the problem of sexism in foreign language\ntextbooks really gone? Not really; it had merely assumed\nmore subtle forms. At first glance, the new\neditions of some of the old offenders provided a\npleasant surprise. For example, cosmetic improvements\nhad been made when updating a textbook\'s illustrations.\nIn dialogues, the ratio  of female to male\ncharacters had improved, and women now played active\nas well as passive, supporting roles. The frequency\nof feminine pronouns in practice exercises had improved;\nthe "Walter ist intelligent, Brigitte ist\nblond" syndrome had abated, and other gratuitous or\nunflattering observations about women\'s habits or\nappearance had largely been purged. Many books, as\nmentioned above, had also added material on the position\nof women in the target culture.\nAt second glance, it became clear that not all\nthe news was good.10 Many improvements had been made\n95\n', 'by deleting material that was clearly offensive. However,\naddition of new material on women proved more\nproblematical. Furthermore, while some texts did add\nmaterial, others actually cut material by and about\nwomen because of rising production costs, falling demand\nand the continued feeling that while this infor-\nmation might be interesting and valuable, it remained\nnonetheless peripheral. Moreover, as Francine Frank\npointed out, the publishers\' guidelines were rather\ngeneral, suggestive rather than prescriptive, and\nnone of them applied specifically to the foreign languages.\nFrank also found enormous inconsistency in\nthe application of guidelines, from publisher to pubisher,\nfrom language to language, from author to au-\nthor within a publisher\'s line, from book to book by\nthe same author(s), and even within the same book.\nFor example, when a textbook was revised, the portions\nwhich were rewritten might avoid the use of\ngeneric masculine; portions which had not been rewritten,\nhowever, would continue to offend. Since\nFrank made her assessment in 1979, there have been\nadditional developments : computer software coming on\nthe market now is so oblivious to the problem of sexism\nthat it is as if the last decade had never hap-\npened; and society\'s conservative drift has given\nsome publishers an excuse to back off from their\nearlier commitment. In addition, we still need to\nreach foreign publishing houses, as well as the producers\nand distributors of all sorts of ancillary\nmaterials, from cultural films and slide shows\nthrough film strips, game books, posters and other\nvisuals.\nClearly, neither guidelines nor checklists have\noutlived their usefulness, and with some refinement\nthey should continue to piay an important role in\ntextbook review and revision for years to come. They\nare the basic instruments of the vigilance Yvonne\nRochette-Ozzello has called for. At the same time,\nthough, the checklist-and-guideline approach, like\nthe focus on "sexism," has also revealed certain limits\nto its usefulness. For one thing, at the class-\nroom level, checklists presuppose an imperfect text\nand place a tremendous burden of responsibility on\nthe individual instructor, who is obliged to rectify\nthe failings of a particular text with a whole series\nof thoughtful and effective strategies. For another,\nchecklists evaluate the textbook on an important\nbut ultimately superficial level : they can help us to\n96\n', 'determine ratios of feminine to masculine pronouns,\nbut can they expose historical inaccuracy, or an\noverwhelmingly masculine perspective, or elitist values?\nUnfortunately, such problems do not lend them-\nselves so neatly to this kind of analysis. Checklists\nsensitized us to the presence of stereotypes and\ncalled for their elimination; but checklists have\nfailed to confront the power of stereotypes -- the\ngrain of truth that is contained in them. Checklists\ncalled for women professionals and female characters\nwith active, assertive personalities; but checklists\ndid not show us how to look at "typical" female behavior\nand find the positive qualities in it. Check-\nlists urged us to make lists of derogatory statements\nabout women in textbooks and to demand their removal;\nbut the general bias of the checklist approach was\nthat women should become more like men.\nThus the checklist approach looked at the images\nof women in textbooks and demanded new images ; it\ndid not attempt to revalue traditional images. In the\nteaching of culture, the checklist approach noted absence\nof women and iobbied for their inclusion,  but\naccording to essentially male notions of accomplishment\nand greatness or relevance. In the teaching of\nlanguage, checklists showed that presentations of\ngrammar, vocabulary and usage also reflected discriminatory\nattitudes toward women; but the checklist ap-\nproach never called into question the kind of language\ntaught at all.  The decade of the \'70s focused\nsharply on educated professional women but paid less\nattention to other important feminist concerns : racism,\nclassism, homophobia and other forms of marginalization\nor exclusion from the dominant culture. During\nthis period, feminists in the foreign languages as\nelsewhere in the women\'s movement pushed to minimize\nreal or apparent differences between women and men\nthat worked to the disadvantage to women. This was\nimportant and necessary work; but the work of maximizing\nthe value of the traditionally feminine re-\nmained to be done.\nThe emergence of women\'s studies as an academic\nfield made it possible to take this next step. Since\nthe late \'60s, women\'s studies has demonstrated extraordinary\nproductivity and intellectual rigor in\nthe service of a perspective that is uniquely inclusive,\negalitarian and humane. The pluralism and\nsensitivity to difference characteristic of women\'s\nstudies research and teaching are entirely congenial\n97\n', 'with the goals of foreign language instruction. In\n1980, Yvonne Rochette-Ozzello was the first to make\nthis connection explicitly, when she spoke to the\nCentral States Conference on "Women\'s Studies and Foreign\nLanguage Teaching: A New Alliance. "H In her\ntalk, which was later published, Rochette-Ozzello argued\nthat when we teach a foreign language and cul-\nture, we help to reduce students\' ethnocentrism,\ntheir tendency to view American culture as the measure\nof all things. Similarly, she contended, by teach-\ning about women in the foreign language classroom, we\ncan compensate for students\' androcentrism, their\nviewing the male as the measure of all things. Her\nspecific suggestions for the classroom were excellent\nbut not particularly original. The real significance\nof the talk lay in the linking of women\'s studies to\nforeign language instruction. Of course, this connection\nhad been made years earlier for literature\nclasses taught at an advanced level; but RochetteOzzello\ninsisted that women\'s studies was relevant in\nan even more profound way right at the beginning level,\nthe level at which we reach the largest number of\nstudents, female and male alike.\nThat same year, at the annual AATG meeting in Boston,\nWomen in German sponsored a session on alternative\ninstructional materials. With slides,tapes,and recordings,\nfor example, by feminist pacifist musicians from\nWest Germany, the session became a virtual celebration\nof the innovative ways in which women could be included in\nforeign language instruction and particularly in the\nteaching of culture. The shift in emphasis from grievance\nto appreciation, from woman as victim to woman as a\ncreative and productive force, however, had even wider\nimplications than this session could suggest.12\nResearch by and about women in art, music and\nliterature, in history, economics and political science,\nin sociology,psychology,anthropology and many oth-\ner areas has provided enough theoretical approaches and\nfactual material so that we can at least begin a radical\n"re-visioning" of the languages and cultures we teach.\nIn practical terms , this means we have new ways of interpreting\nthe old problems-- exclusion, subordination,\ndistortion and degradation -- and new ways to combat\nthem. At the same time,we are now equipped to confront\nmore recently recognized problems : fragmenta-\ntion, historical inaccuracy, and unreality (the portrayal\nof complex and controversial social issues in\nan unrealistically bland and unproblematical,superficial\nway.13\n98\n', 'We can counter exclusion and underrepresentation\nwith a growing body of knowledge about women,\ntheir lives and their works. Women\'s studies research\nhas begun to tell us what women\'s existence as half\nthe human population has meant not only for the elite\nor public culture of a language group, but also for\nits private culture: the domestic, material, emotional\nor religious life of the population. For example,\nwe can make a lesson on Germany\'s abortive revolution\nof 1848 more balanced and accurate with an ac-\ncount of the German women\'s movement born that year,\nand of the close connection German women perceived\nthen between their personal hopes and the nation\'s\nhopes for unity and democracy. And we can point to\nthe dislocation and misery of the laboring classes\nin German society that subsequently created not only\nliberal and socialist political parties, but also a\nbourgeois and a socialist women\'s movement. Whenever\ncultural material is presented, either in a\ntextbook or in the classroom, it should be presented\nwith sensitivity to the implications of gender. "Women\'s\nissues" should not be isolated in special sec-\ntions of a textbook or syllabus, any more than women\ncan be separated from humanity. Specifically referring\nto women and men instead of using the generic\nmasculine -- for example, saying "Arbeiter und Arbeiterinnen"\ninstead of "der Arbeitnehmer" -- forces us\nto consider whether a generalization really is equally\nvalid for both sexes.\nSubordination, like exclusion, is a function of\nmasculine perspective. Women\'s studies, however, argues\nfor the validity of the feminine perspective:\nit makes women\'s invisible sphere visible, and it assigns\nvalue to that sphere. What does this mean in\nconcrete terms? A recent Italian textbook^ devotes\nseveral chapters to preparation and anticipation -by\nfemale relatives -- before Beppino, the American\ncousin, arrives. Are the Italian women thus "subordinated"\nto Beppino? As the textbook is set up, they\nare; yet the same incidents could be related in an\nentirely different way. As the textbook structures\nthe story, we see the visit through Beppino\'s eyes,\nbut it could also be presented from other points of\nview. Perhaps there is a great aunt who\'ll have to\ndo all the cooking for the party in his honor. Of\ncourse she\'s glad to see him, but perhaps she\'s also\nwondering how she\'ll ever fit all this prepara-\ntion into an already heavy workload. And the aunt -perhaps\nshe\'s eager to create for Beppino the pleas-\n99\n', 'ant illusion that he\'s the center of all activity,\nanxious to conceal the business worries that are consuming\nher and Beppino\'s uncle. Or the elderly deaf\ndomestic (an object of humor in the book) -- perhaps\nshe hears little but understands even less of what\nBeppino says because his sentence intonation is off\nand he never bothers to look at her when he speaks,\nOr Marcella, his Italian cousin -- perhaps she is\nannoyed to discover that Beppino has no social conscience\nand no interest in socialism. But she doesn\'t\nwant to spoil his visit, so she decides not to talk\npolitics. Beppino\'s arrival can mean many things to\nmany people; multiple perspectives can give insight\nnot only into gender differences but also into those\nrelated to age, class, politics and many other factors.\nMost American textbooks, today, however, fol-\nlow one or two main characters -- usually young (male)\nundergraduates -- through the textbook, and the books\ninevitably reflect this paucity of viewpoint.\nWhat of stereotyping and distortion? Of course,\ntextbooks should show women in non-traditional jobs,\nwithout overpopulating the text to the point of implausibility;\nand the textbooks should show non-trad-\nitional blue-collar and white-collar jobs as well as\nprestigious professional ones. Most especially, though,\nwe need to reexamine traditional images of women. The\nproblem with stereotypes is not exactly that they are\ninaccurate, but that they contain just enough truth\nto seem compelling. Yet stereotypes are distortion,\nbecause they simplify and make what is merely common\ninto an emcompassing -- and often oppressive -generalization.\nWhile I do not think textbooks should\npromulgate stereotypes, I do think textbooks should\ninclude images of traditional women, which should be\nanalysed for insights into the target culture and\nfor an appreciation of the genuine values they embody.\nTake, for example, the conscientious Hausfrau\nthat occurs in a widely used German textbook.15\nYes, Frau Braun goes to specialty shops several\ntimes a week for just the right brand or blend or\nflavor of whatever. Her behavior, however, is neither\nsilly nor quaint; she goes to these specialty\nshops for specific practical and emotional reasons.\nWhy does she insist on unground coffee or day-old\nrye bread? Why does she take her housewifely role\nso seriously? If we take Frau Braun seriously, we\ncan learn something about the German notion of "Beruf,"\nliterally of "calling," in its secular and\nmore-than-secular dimensions. Frau Braun\'s percep-\n100\n', 'tion of her role and her dedication to it are related\nto the German work ethic generally, and we understand\nall of German society, not just housewives,\nbetter when we realize that. Similarly, the concierge,\na standard character in French textbooks and a traditional\nbutt of jokes, can be treated with compassion\nand respect instead: a case history, perhaps, can\nchronicle her poverty, her pain and her triumphs of\nsurvival in a hostile world.\nDerogatory generalizations about women have\nlargely disappeared from our textbooks, but the attitudes\nthat inspire them, from sexism through outright\nmisogyny, have not disappeared from the cultures we\nteach. When our students do encounter such attitudes,\nwhether in literature, art, film or elsewhere, we\nshould sensitize our students and be prepared to discuss\nthe symbols and manifestations of misogyny in\nthe target culture.\nThe pluralistic approach of women\'s studies also\nsuggests a way to deal with problems of exclusion or\nsubordination in the teaching of grammar, vocabulary,\nand usage. Until recently, textbooks tended to be extremely\nconservative: they taught what was "right"\neven if it sounded stilted or was no longer in common\nuse. Recent emphasis on "communication" has\nchanged that somewhat, but not to the benefit of women.\nThe fact is, languages are not static; they\nchange and evolve constantly to respond to new needs,\nand particularly in the ways languages refer to women\nthere is currently a pressing need. Feminists in\nmany countries are working to develop non-discriminatory\nalternatives to such problems as generic\nmasculine or non-traditional job titles. Some of\ntheir coinage may be accepted; other recommendations\nwill not be. There is no reason,  however, why a\ntextbook cannot at least acquaint students with this\n"work in progress," instead of painting a monolithic\npicture of a language dominated by rules rather than\nby the people who use it.\nThe pluralism inherent in women\'s studies has\nalso made us realize just how narrow the sociological\nperspective of most foreign language textbooks\nis. The foreign language textbooks published in the\nUnited States today are overwhelmingly populated by\nan educated, urban upper-middle class. Healthy, attractive\nyoung professionals-to-be with politically\n101\n', 'and psychologically unproblematical characters attend\nuniversity, sit in cafes or travel around the land\nof the target culture. Children, the elderly and the\nhandicapped, the socially disadvantaged and the politically\nuncomfortable -- all are notable by their\nabsence. So are crises of any sort: these characters\nnever seem to suffer a grievous personal loss, a\nshattering failure or an economic setback. Nor, for\nthat matter, do they ever achieve moments of ecstatic\njoy, intense satisfaction, significant personal insight\nor utter hilarity. Linguistically, we find a\nbias toward a bland, educated, public, "correct"\nlanguage without trace of regionalisms, class characteristics,\ndialect or intimate usage. Students\nlearn the vocabulary for socially conservative, politically\ninnocuous behavior, never the vocabulary\nof outrage or rebellion. Sociologically, emotionally\nand linguistically, these textbooks offer a remarkably\nimpoverished slice of life. Is it pure coince-\ndence that patriarchal culture has favored the dominant\nclass over the oppressed, the rational over\nthe emotional, theory over practice and the public\nsphere over the private? But the effect of all this\non the language learning process has been to make it\nabout as inoffensive -- and boring -- as it can become\n.\nThe utter absence of any but the mildest emotions\nin the teaching of foreign language today, how-\never, brings us to another insight, perhaps the most\nfar-reaching of all, that women\'s studies has afforded\nus. Feminist consciousness taught us to look at\nthe images of women and girls in textbooks with new\neyes and to demand more varied, accurate and humane\nportrayal. Women\'s studies research helped us, particularly\nin the teaching of culture, to see and\npass on a more balanced picture, one that included\nthe presence and contributions of women as half\nthe population. Most recently, however, work by feminist\neociolinguists in discourse analysis has given\nus new insight into the differences -- real and/or\nperceived -- between women\'s and men\'s speech. In\nother words, a previously unquestioned, invisible"given" has suddenly become visible.1"\nWhat we have begun to see, when we look at foreign\nlanguage textbooks, is that they teach an over-\nwhelmingly "male" use of language. That is, we find\nheavy emphasis on transmission of information and\nproblem-solving, with notable neglect of other uses\n102\n', 'of language. In the introduction to their remarkable\nbook, Women and Language in Literature and Society,\nSally McConnell-Ginet, Ruth Borker and Nelly Furman\nwrite :\n"There are important differences among the\ndiverse uses to which language is put...\nperhaps most surprising to many is the suggestion\nthat \'communication\' in the narrow\nsense of transfer of information is probably\nnot the predominant use of language\neven outside literary contexts. We flirt,\nscold"] exhort, implore, protest -- and talk\njust to connect ourselves to others, to\nreduce our isolation." 1\'\nIn other words, they argue that we use language above\nall to relate to other people. Looked at in this way,\nthe speech act calls for a different kind of analysis,\nan analysis of such phenomena as hedges, tag\nquestions or vocalized pauses that do little to advance\nthe transfer of information or solution of\nproblems, but which do convey subtle emotional and\nrelational signals.\nIt is the "male" uses of language -- impersonal\nand objective, for information-transfer and problemsolving\n-- that we have tended to view as the stand-\nard for language per se, while "female" uses of language\n-- indirect and subjective, for expressing emo-\ntion or relating to others -- have tended to remain\ninvisible or to be regarded as less valuable uses of\nlanguage. Of course, men also use "female" language\nand women use "male" language, so describing them\nin this way is misleading. But the labelling is accurate\nin so far as "male" language is perceived as\ncharacteristic of men, is viewed as "the real thing"\nand enjoys higher status and credibility. "Female"\nlanguage, on the other hand, is perceived as characteristic\nof women and is less likely to be taken\nseriously. O\'Barr and AtkinslÂ° suggest that these\ntwo styles of speech be called not "women\'s" and\n"men\'s" language, as Robin Lakoff did, but rather\n"powerful"and "powerless". These descriptive terms,\nhowever, fail to acknowledge the positive qualities\nof the "female"style.\nIn any case, when we "re-view" foreign language\nas it is taught in current textbooks from McConnellGinet,\nBorker and Furman\'s point of view, we sud-\ndenly register the absence of countless phenomena\n103\n', 'of everyday speech: hedges, tag questions and qualifiers,\n"empty"adjectives, diminutives and super-pol-\nite forms. There are no fillers, bits, vocalized\npauses or curses; we miss exclamations, interjections\nand all kinds of spontaneous emotional outbursts. The\ncharacters in textbook dialogues talk blandly and\nstraightforwardly, proceeding from information transfer\nto some sort of resolution; in real life, how-\never, our conversations are rarely so orderly or\ngoal-directed. We make false starts, lose the thread,\nare interrupted or diverted. Our "normal" conversations\nare not linearbut meandering or circular; why\nelse would it be so difficult, in a class or a committee\nmeeting, to conduct an "orderly" discussion?\nIn fact, textbook dialogues reveal almost nothing\nof the conversational dynamics which sociolin-\nguists have studied and documented: phenomena such\nas topic initiation, interruption, or switch of topic;\nconversation as a model for competitive or col-\nlaborative activity; and the sustaining of conversation\nby means of gambits, links, mediations, lead-\ning questions and expressions of interest, encouragement,\nenthusiasm or agreement. Not surprisingly,\ngender plays a large role in conversational dynamics.\n"Female" speech styles, for example, seem to favor\ncollaboration, while "male" speech styles encourage\ncompetition for dominance.19 In single-sex conversation\ngroups, the work of sustaining conversation\nmay be shared by all; in mixed-sex groups, however,\nthis "supporting role" seems to fall overwhelmingly\nto women. While women\'s speech may be criticized for\nbeing too indirect, tentative or discursive, these\nsame qualities can be interpreted positively as tact,\na reluctance to pass judgement and sympathy. Seen\nin this light, these speech characteristics may serve\nan important function not merely in the sustaining\nof conversation but in the sustaining of human relationships\n.\nYet little attention is paid in most foreign\nlanguage instruction to the subtleties, the polite\nor deferential forms, indirectness and other qualities\nwhich characterize many women\'s speech, par-\nticularly in the expression of opinions, desires\nor commands; nor do textbooks explore the implications\nof diminutive forms or subjunctives. Finally,\nthere is a vast range of language -- the language\nfor confiding problems or unloading emotional bur-\n104\n', 'dens, the language of intimacy, of newstelling and\ngossip, of irony, storytelling and bawdy humor -that\nis barely tapped for the beginning student. As\na result, our students learn a "language" that is\nbloodless, impoverished and impersonal. If they fail\nto get excited about the experience, we should hardly\nbe surprised.\nOf course I do not wish to suggest a return to\ngender stereotypes when I argue that this "invisible"\nrealm of language and linguistic interaction be made\nvisible to our students. One of the most interesting\nfindings of recent research is that "male" speech\nand "female" speech do not in fact differ nearly as\nwidely as they are perceived to differ . Men do make\nuse of "female" speech patterns and vice versa. I\nwould suggest rather that in this area as in others,\nthe emotional/relational should be valued along with\nthe rational; and the roles and responsibilities of\nlinguistic interaction should be shared equitably\nbetween women and men, with greater awareness on\nboth sides of the dynamics and implications. If a\nforeign language textbook can accomplish that for\nits students, then\' it has taught them something\nvery powerful indeed.\nSince we have only begun to think about this\nkind of transformation of foreign language instruction,\nit is difficult to say exactly what a textbook\nof the future might look like. We can make a few\nrecommendations, though. Most obviously, vocabulary,\ndialogues and reading passages should deal not only\nwith bland, fact-oriented "public" situations; students\nshould also be exposed to the language of in-\ntimacy and emotion. Multiple perspectives should be\nused to teach about the lives and views of a variety\nof classes or ethnic minorities in the target culture,\nand at the same time to expose students to\nlinguistic variety. We could get away from linear\nconversations, which are rigidly structured and\nmake it almost impossible for students to join in\nspontaneously. Instead, we could provide circular\nconversational forms, which would provide multiple\nopenings for a wide variety of comments. For example,\na linear conversation begins with an exchange of information\nand usually ends with some sort of reso-\nlution: a decision to go somewhere or do something\nspecific. Each line of the dialogue builds on the\nline that went before and is the precondition for\n105\n', 'the line to follow; students can only use the lines\nthey have memorized in the "correct" order. Every\nlanguage teacher knows the chaos that ensues when\nstudents miss their cues in the recitation of this\nkind of dialogue. A circular conversation, on the\nother hand, begins with a-verbalized situation, forexample, "I\'ve lost it!!"21 This opens the door to\nall sorts of questions, responses and exclamations\nfrom any number of students, in almost any order.\nWe could also structure conversations around the\nnotion of dynamics rather than specific content. That\nis, we could teach students a series of phrases commonly\nused to interrupt a conversation, or to in-\ntroduce a new topic, and then assign roles: "maintainers,"\n"interruptors," and so on. The ultimate\nbenefit of all this for the students would presumably\nbe greater sensitivity to language and heightened\nawareness of dynamics, not only in the target language\nbutin the student\'s native language as well.\nThere is no need for me to repeat what has\nbeen said so well so many times before -- by Adrienne\nRich, Mary Daly and many others -- about the\npower that control of language is able to confer. It\nfollows that when we teach language, either the student\'s\nnative tongue or a new and "foreign" language,\nwe are also teaching power --or continued powerlessness.\nFor us to teach language more successful-\nly, however, several things are necessary. First,\nwe must dispell the notion, common not only among\nauthors and editors but students and teachers as\nwell, that problems of sex stereotyping and the like\nhave been solved in the newer editions of our textbooks.\nTreatment of women and minorities has changed\nbut it is still highly problematic. Second, it is\nessential for all of us working in foreign languages\nto understand that women\'s studies is relÃ¨vent not\nonly to advanced-level literature classes; women\'s\nstudies perspectives can also make a profound contribution\nat the ground level of our discipline, the\nlevel at which we encounter the majority of our\nstudents. Finally, we can reassert the centrality of\nforeign languages in the liberal arts curriculum.\nThe place of foreign languages in that curriculum\nhas become increasingly peripheral and insecure over\nthe last two decades, the current interest in "core\ncurriculum" and "central disciplines" notwithstanding.\nBy teaching a richer, more inclusive language\nand a better balanced, less politicized view of\n106\n', 'human experience, it seems to me that we can stay\nthat drift toward the periphery. We can make the\nstudy of foreign language do for the student what\nwe have always claimed it could do -- develop articulateness,\ndiscipline the mind, widen horizons and\nheighten sensitivity -- and do it better than ever.\nUniversity of Connecticut\nNotes\n1 Sartori-Stein, Anneliese, "Kultureller Chauvinismus\nim Grammatik-Drill," Die Unterrichtspraxis\n32 (1975) , pp. 10-20.\n2 Schmitz, Betty, "Sexism in French Language\nTextbooks," The Cultural Revolution in Foreign Lan guage\nTeaching,ed.
