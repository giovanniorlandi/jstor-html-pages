One instance re\ncently along the Peninsula line south of San Francisco will serve to\nillustrate how the railroad is adopting friendly tactics to keep the\ngood will of the traveling public.

Scrugham\nas State Engineer in water adjudications.\n(From the Gardnerville Record-Courier)\nCarson City, Nev., Oct 23, 1922.\nEDITOR RECbRD-COURIER:\nIn January, 1895, General Robert M.\nClarke, L. H. Taylor, civil engineer,\nand myself worked the greater part of\na week drafting a water law for Ne\nvada. It was introduced in the Legis\nlature that year and failed to pass, and\nre-introduced in 1897 and failed again,\nbut was passed in 1899. It provided\nthat "All natural water courses, and\nnatural lakes and the waters thereof\n- which are not held in private owner\nship, belong to the state, and are sub\nject to regulation and control by the\nstate. All existing rights to the use\nof water, whether acquired by appro\npriation, or otherwise, shall be respect\ned and preserved, and nothing in this\nAct shall be construed as enlarging,\nabridging or restricting such rights."\nThe farmers had opposed the former\nmeasures until they were assured that\nvested rights would not be interfered\nwith.\nIn 1903, an Act was passed providing\nfor the co-operation of the State of\nNevada with the Secretary of the In\nterior with reference to the acqu;re\nment of water rights, etc., and the of\nfice of State Engineer was created, and\nall Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent\nwith the Act were repealed.\nIn 1905 the Legislature amended the\nAct of 1903 by taking away certain\nlimitations upon the appointment of\nthe State Engineer, and also d\'rectcd\nthe Board of Irrigation to divide the\nstate into Water Districts, and added\nsix new sections to the Act.\nIn 1907 a new water law was passed,\nwhich also created the office of State\nEngineer, and all former conflicting\nActs were repealed, and in 1909 the\nLegislature passed several amendments\nto the Act.\nIn 1913 our present comprehensive\nwater law passed, very much amended\nin 1915.\nIn 1919 an Act was passed defining\nfurther the duties of the State Engi\nneer, and also repealed certain sections\nof former laws.\nIn 1921 the Legislature made several\namendments to conform to the deci\nsion of the Supreme Court in the case\nof Pitt ct al. vs. Scrugham. in which\nit declared sections 29, 30, 31, and 32\nunconstitutional, because they attempt\ned to give judicial powers to the State\nEngineer to hear and determine con\ntests involving not only relative rights,\nbut also vested rights. John M. Chartz.\nas District Attorney of Ormsby Coun\nty, in the case of Ormsby County vs.\nKearney, tried in 1914. had made the\nsame objection, claiming that the Act\nof 1913, which had the same provisions\nas the Act of 1915, violated the Con\nstitution on the ground that it vested\n, the State Engineer with judicial\npowers.\nActing under the Act of 1903, in 1905,\nA. E. \' Chandler, then State Engineer!\nmade what he called an "Abstract of\nClaims to Waters of Carson Riv?r."\nBut, In his Abstracts, HE FAILED TO\nGIVE THE LENGTH OF THE SEA\nSONS, NOR THE CUBIC FEET\nPER SECOND THAT CLAIMANTS\nWERE ENTITLED TO, NOR THE\nDUTY OF WATER PER ACRE-\nFEET. So, in no sense of the term,\ncould his work be called an adjudica\ntion. His abstracts were based solely\nupon ex parte testimony, and upon ex\namination of what records might have\nbeen found in the ofilces of the several\nCounty Recorders. There was no trial\nin any sense of the term, and the farm\ners having been assured that their\nvested rights would not be d:sturbed,\ntook precious little interest in the in\nvestigations, made by Chandler. - But\nthere were several exceedingly diligent\npersons who produced witnesses, and\nwho filed affidavits, who managed to\nshove their rights three or four years\nahead, and in this manner vested rights\nwere interfered with, to the dismay and\ngreat indignation of the great majority\nof the water users on the Carson River.\nIN 1909-1910, EMMET D. BOYLE,\nTHEN STATE ENGINEER, EM\nBODIED THE WORK OF CHAND\nLER IN HIS BIENNIAL REPORT\nTO THE LEGISLATURE, AND IN\n1911-1912, W. M. KEARNEY, THEN\nSTATE ENGINEER, DID THE\nSAME THING IN HIS REPORT.\nIN 1921, J. G. SCRUGHAM, AS\nSTATE ENGINEER, MADE AN AB\nSTRACT OF CLAIMS IN AND TO\nTHE WATERS OF THE CARSON\nRIVER AND ITS FORKS IN THE\nCOUNTIES OF ORMSBY, DOUG\nLAS AND LYON, AND SUBSE\nQUENTLY FILED HIS PRELIMI\nNARY ORDER OF DETERMINA\nTION OF THE RELATIVE RIGHTS\nTO SAID WATERS, WHICH UPON\nAPPROVAL BY THE COURTS BE\nCOMES THE LAW OF THE LAND,\nBEING COMPLETE IN EVERY\nPARTICULAR, AND IN CON\nFORMITY WITH THE DECISION\n\' OF THE SUPREME COURT.\nSerugham\'s work is based upon Coun\nty records, testimony of witnesses, and\nupon the evidence elicited In the case\nof Urion Mill & Mining Company vs.\nDangberg et al., tried in 1872, and upon\na similar case and between the same\nparties tried before Judge Hawley in\nthe Federal Court in 1S89. and upon the\ncase of Anderson et al vs. Eassman et\na!., tr\'ed in 1899 before Judge Morrow\nin the United States Circuit Court,\nNorthern District of California. I was\nthe official shorthand reporter in the\ncase tried before Judge Hawley and\nthe attorney for plaintiffs in the case\ntried before Judge Morrow. In all those\ncases the orginal locators and appro\npriated and users of the water testified,\nand they were examined and cross- .\nexamined in the presence of each other,\nand the truth was elicited, and in\nneither of those cases is there any testi\nmony that would justify granting such\nearly rights as Chandler attempted to\ngrant.\nUnder the Chandler attempted adjudi\ncaton, it was utterly impossible to de\ntermine what surplus water remained\nin the river at any time of the year, and,\ntherefore, it was impossible to enlist\nany capital to build reservoirs for stor\nage for the same reason, and the WORK\nAND ADJUDICATION MADE BY\nSCRUGHAM BECAME IMPERA\nTIVE AND AN ABSOLUTE NECES\nSITY.
