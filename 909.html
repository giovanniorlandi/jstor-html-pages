        <pre>["THE KEMPER HERALD\nVOL, XXX. _SCOOBA, MISS., THURSDAY, FEB. 9, 1905.\nDIVERSIFICATION\nOF FARM PRODUCTS\nOF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE\nTO ALL FARMERS.\nsomethingIoIell daily\nText of Resolutions Adopted at the In\nterstate Cotton Convention Held in\nNew Orleans Last Week. Plan of\nDiversification Treated Intelligently.\nThe great cotton convention which\nwas held in New Orleans last week\nhas emphasized in no unmistakable\nterms that the prosperity of the south\nis dependent upon diversification; that\nthe welfare and happiness of every\nfarmer, every merchant and every\nbanker is to have each farmer prac\ntice diversification, so that he may\ncontrol his cotton instead of being\ncontrolled by it; that he must make\nit a surplus crop and not a sole de\npendent. .\nThe south is rich in fertile lands,\nand an equitable climate to produce\nall the great food crops of the world,\nand with livestock become the most\nindependent and prosperous section.\nThere is no other section of the Union\nthat can produce as great a variety\nof crops as the south.\nThe National Cotton Association\nstands for the reduction of the cotton\nacreage and the consequent increase\nin diversification. Our plan is.to have\na community of interest between the\nfarmer, the merchant, the banker and\nthe local paper, for diversification\nalong such lines a£ will be the best in\nterest of each individual community.\nAnd in this work the National Cotton\nA Vinn + Vl r» ClinrVArf QA/I Pit.\ndorsement of the farmers, the bank\ners, merchants, newspapers, spinners\nand the legitimate'handlers of cotton.\nIt also has in this the support of every\nfriend and well-wisher of the farmer\nand those who are really working for\nthe prosperity and upbuilding of the\nsouth.\nThere should be a community of in\nterest and a close organization be\ntween the farmers, and bankers and\nthe editor of each local newspaper of\nevery school district of the south, not\nonly a sto cotton, but as to all other\nonly that can be raised with profit.\nThe National Cotton Association\nhas received reports from the school\nprecinct meetings that more than\n400,000 farmers, bankers and mer\nchants are pledged to a reduction of\nthe cotton acreage and adoption of di\nversification. This work will be kept\nup through the local committee of\neach school precinct cotton association\nuntil every farmer in the southern\nstates has been pledged to diversifi\ncation and a reduction of the cotton\nacreage.\nMore than 2,000 editors of the lo\ncal papers throughout the south have\nreplied to our personal letters and\nsaid that they will carry a department\nin each issue on “Diversification.”\nDiversification means first, that\nevery farmer should set aside a suffi\ncient amount of land to produce all\nthe food and forage he will need for\nhis own consumption.\nSecond—Then plant a little more of\n—_-«n l>n nnn Crtll frit' OOcVl\nOUVU VI l* V -- -\neach month in the year in his local\nmarket, or, together with his neigh\nbors, make up a shipment for the\nlarger market, and in this each one\nwants the advice of his local banker,\nmerchant and editor.\nThird—When those two are provid\ned for, then plant your cotton crop.\nMake cotton your surplus crop.\nWith the possible exception of Tex\nas, there is not a southern state that\nraises enough com, oats and other\ngrains to supply the home demand,\nand every year your cotton money\ngoes to swell the wealth of the wes\ntern grain farmer.\nThe following shows the production\nIn the various cotton states of com\nin 1904:\nState. Bushels.\nNorth Carolina . 40,705,478\nSouth Carolina. 22,189,837\nGeorgia . 47,334,713\nFlorida. 6,640,334\nAlabama. 41,877,165\nMississippi. 39,709,664\nLouisiana. 27,258,443\nTexas.136,702,699\nArkansas. 48,332,614\nTennessee. 80,890,025\nThere is no reason why the south\nshould import corn, but there is every\nreason why we should not only raise\nenough for our own consumption but\nmake it an article of export. Every\nsouthern state is nearer the great ex\nport markets of the world than the\ngreat Central West, which is now sup\nplying these markets.\nStart a campaign in your school\nIncinerates Himself.\nMarietta, O.—After shooting his\nwife near Wick, W. Va., Lindsay\nsay Owens committed suicide by burn\ning himself in a blazing oil well. Be\nlieving that his wife was fatally\nwounded, he went to an oil well near\nby and having set fire to the gas fumes\n^he leaped headlong into the flames. His\ny charred body was taken out later. Mrs\n•\nprecinct association for more corn.\nThere are farmers in every community\nwho always make a success in raising\ncorn; let them tell you how to do it.\nThere is more money in corn at 50\ncents a bushel than cotton at 6 cents\na pound.\nResolution by Southern Bankers.\n“Resolved, That we, the southern\nbankers, heartily endorse the object\nof said association and promise our\nhearty co-operation.\n“Second, That we believe that the\nbankers are amply able and willing\nto finance the holding of the surplus\nof the present crop, which we propose\nto do, provided the acreage of cotton\nfor 1905 is reduced not less than 25\nper cent and the fertilizers in like\nproportion.\n“Third, That we urge the necessity\nof a thorough organization and call\non the various interests of the country\nto assist in keeping this question agi\nated from now until such time as a\nperfect organization shall have been\naffected. ’ ’\nResolutions adopted at the Inter\nsate Cotton Convention, New Orleans,\nLa.:\nReducion of Acreage.\n“We ,your committee on acreage\nand fertilizers, do recommend that\nthe acreage to be planted in Cotton\nin 1905 shall be 25 per cent less than\nin 1904, and there shall be a reduc\ntion of 25 per cent in the use of the\ncommercial fertilizers in the growing\nof cotton.”\nFinancing and Holding Present Crop.\n“Your committee concludes, after\nlast night’s exhaustive session and the\nmorning’s discussion, that each state\nand local section seems amply able to\nfinance their present holdings. We\nbelieve the cotton now in the hands\nof the producer should remain at\nhome on the farm or be stored in local\nwarehouses, having same fully pro\ntected from the elements and dangers\nof fire. The banks and commission\nmen evidence their willingness and\ndesire to aid in marketing the balance\nof th ci'op, so as to hold in check\nany disposition to rush in their cotton\nunduly and break the market.\n“We feel if the convention, as a\nwhole, pledges itself and the respective\nstates these delegates represent to an\nabsolute leduction of 25 per cent in\ncoton aci-eage for the year 1905 and\n25 per cent reduction in the use of\nfertilizers, the entire problem will be\nsolved.”\nDENIAL FROM ALDERMAN.\nHe Did Not Say That Southerners\nLack Brains.\nRichmond, Va.—Dr. Edwin A. Al\nderman, president of the University\nof Vii’ginia, has issued a statement in\ncontradiction of criticisms of the\nspeech made by him in New York\nlast December before the Southern\nSociety. Senator J. W. Bailey, of\nTexas, was one of those most severe\non Dr. Alderman, saying he had at\ntempted to belittle Soutlierners. Dr.\nAlderman declares that he did not say\nSouthernei's lack bi-ains. What he\ndid mean to say was that Southerners\nlack scientific training for the thor\nough treatment of great problems.\nNoi’thern weakness, he said, was to be\nfound in materialism ,and in a view\nof Government not wholly for the pub\nlic good.\nNumbers Pasted Over.\nChicago.—Mention of a Texas leg\nislature came up in the United States\nDistrict Court here through an effort\nof counsel for John H. Dalton to\n... il. -1_ _ i-i._i- T_A\npiU V O lliUll au anvuijpu MVVW\nto defraud Dalton by means of a\nforged ‘ ‘ option ’ ’ ticket. Dalton is on\ntrial charged with promoting a lot\ntery. The so-called “option”- ticket\nwas exhibited in court to prove that\nan alleged fraudulent number had\nbeen pasted over the real number\nborne by the ticket. The alleged al\ntered ticket called for $15,000, but a\nbank through which Dalton is said\nto have carried on the financial end\nof the alleged scheme refused to honor\nthe ticket on the ground that the\nticket had been forged.\nSugar Workers Strike.\nWarsaw.—The workmen in all the\nsugar factories of Poland, which num\nber forty-two, struck Feb. 2. These\nfactories hitherto have been working\nday and night to supply the troops in\nManchuria. The employes of the iron\nworks at Sosnovice struck. Later\nreports from Lodz say the disturb\nances there ended quickly. The mili\ntary fired one volley, killing two and\nwounding two, and the rioters fled.\nThe town is completely quiet. The\nauthorities have taken extraordinary\nprecautions to maintain prder. There\nis a report from Radogossez that a\nmob there killed one officer and two\nsoldiers. A general strike com\nmenced this morning at Pabianica.\nLadrone Leader Beheaded.\nNew York.—A cable to the Sun\nfrom Manila says: A force of con\nstabulary commanded by Lieut. Moh\nler has killed five subleaders of the\nladrones in the Island of Negros and\nbeheaded Papa Ssio, their leader.\nPapa Isio was caled the scourge of the\nisland. For ten years he was en\ngaged in pillaging haciendas and kid\nnapping farmers for ransom. A re\n(MISSISSIPPI NEWS MATTERS'\nA Brief Chronicle of the Important Happenings\nV . _ _ . __. J\n$35,000 From Rockefeller.\nDr. W. T. Lowrey, president of Mis\nsissippi College at Clinton has arrived\nfrom New York, where he attended a\nmeeting of the Baptist Educational\nSociety of America. As a result of\nhis visit to New York it is more than\nlikely that Dr. Lowrey will receive\nfor Mississippi College from John D.\nRockefeller an additional endowment\nof about $35,000 for Mississippi Col\nlege. Some time ago, when President\nLowrey undertook the work of in\ncreasing the Mississippi College en\ndowment in the sum of $45,000. Mr.\nRockefeller agreed to give $15,000 to\nthe institution when the Baptists of\nMississippi succeeded in raising $45,\n000. This agreement was complied\nwith and President Lowrey is now\nengaged in an effort to raise $100,000\nfor the purpose of erecting new build\nings and securing additional equip\nment at the college. While in New\nYork he received an intimation that\nMr. Rockefeller was well pleased with\nthe prompt manner in which the pre\nvious endowment had been raised,\nand is willing to again aid the institu\ntion.\nWater Power Increasing.\nThe value of water power is increas\ning as the supply of coal and other\nfuel is diminishing. Although it seems\nthat they attract little interest there\nare a number of locations for water\nnmrpr nlnntc in ATississiuoi. TheV\nmay come into use later on, possibly\nafter they have been let go by the\npresent owners to some smooth fel\nlow who realizes what the}’ are worth.\nThere are several in the Southern por\ntion of the State and few in the North\nern. While the proximity of a large\ntown or city is necessary for the suc\ncess of an electric power plant, indi\nvidual manufacturing plants can be\ntpiilt almost anywhere. If you own a\nwater power, get what it is worth be\nfore letting it go.\nReddoch Talks.\nMartin L. Reddoch stated that he\nexpected to make his bond within the\nnext few days as he has communicated\nwith his relatives on this subject. He\nstated that when he obtained employ\nment with the government as a secret\nagent of the department of justice he\nnever informed them that the was an\nex-convict, but he said that he took\nno pains to conceal this fact. He says\nthat the first that he knew that his\nservices were wanted was when he\nreceived a telegram from Assistant At\ntorney General Robb and afterwards\nhad a communication from United\nStates District Attorney Skinner at\nRaleigh, in regard to the matter.\nRush Charter.\nA rush application was filed with the\ngovernor for a charter for the Pensa\ncola, Alabama and Western Railroad\nCompany. The projected route is\nsoutheasterly from Memphis, enter\ning Mississippi on the northern boun\ndary of De Soto county, then south\neasterly through De Soto, Tate, Lafay\nette, Marshall, Calhoun, Chickasaw,\nClay and the southeastern corner of\nLowndes into Alabama. The projec\ntors state that all financial arrange\nmerits nave oeen maae, ana wai uusy\ndesire to build a railroad and to build\nit now.\nSecures Tax Exemption.\nAt a meeting of the Board of Mayor\nand Aldermen of Natchez an ordi\nnance to encourage manufactories and\nnew industries by granting an exemp\ntion from taxation for a period of ten\nyears was adopted by a unanimous\nvote. The exemption will be granted\nto certain manufactories and new en\nterprises established before Jan. 1,\n1910. An exemption from county and\nstate taxation for five years is grant\ned under Chapter 48. Acts of 1900.\nThe city ordinance was adopted in re\nsponse to a petition by the Natchez\nPromotive League.\nRailroads Win Out in Two Suits.\nAmong twenty-five cases so far dis\nposed of at the present session of the\nCircuit Court was that of Karter vs.\nthe Gulf and Ship Island Railroad.\nThe plaintiff asked for $20,000 dam\nages. A decision was rendered in fa\nvor of the company without the case\ngoing to the jury. The case of Mary\nN. Slay vs. the Louisville and Nash\nville railroad, for $2,000 damages, re\nsulted in a verdict in favor of the\ndefendant. Tesch vs. the Pass Chris\ntian Packing Company, verdict foi\nplaintiff. W. J. Nelson vs. John Bal\nlino, verdict for plaintiff.\nMasons Swindled.\nCharles -Fisher, alias Karl Fisher\nalias Oscar Hartman, alias William T,\nHartman, has been trying to work the\nMasonic lodges of Meridian for sev\neral days. Fisher is sailing under Ma\nsonic colors, and seems to have oper\nated in various parts of the Unitec\nStates, wearing a Masonic pin anc\nI displaying bogus receipts for dues\nI which he pretends to have paid t(\nGood for Guntown.\nA most commendable piece of work\nhas been reported from Guntown\nwhere a local bank paid for 100 sub\nscriptions to the Hot Times, the home\npaper, and sent to its patrons for a\nyear. It will prove a good invest\nment for both the bank and the paper.\nA town is largely judged away from\nhome by the appearance of the lo\ncal papers, and this piece of business\ngenerosity on the part of the bank\nwill be of benefit to the paper. Then\ntoo, the prosperity and business of the\ntown is largely the work of the paper,\nif there is more business for the town\n.here will as a matterof course be more\nbusiness for the bank. So the action\nof the bank in question was a good\nbusiness move. It is feared that a\nlarge number of newspapers will want\nto move to Guntown.\nMilitia Company Suspended.\nThe following order was issued, by\nAdjutant General Fridge:\nSpecial Orders No. 7.\nOn account of inefficiency Company\nD, first infantry, stationed at West\nPoint, is hereby suspended from duty\nfor a period of forty days from date.\nAt the expiration of this term if the\ncondition of the company is not im\nproved it will be mustered out of the\nservice.\nFirst Lieut. J. C. Limberger will re\nmain in command of the company and\nwill have all government property in\npossession of officers and enlisted men\nturned in and safety stored until fur\nther orders.\nBy order of the governor.\nARTHUR FRIDGE,\nAdjutant General.\nGuage Widened.\nThe M. J. & K. C. railroad has been\nmade standard guage as far North as\nCotton Plant. The guage from New\nAlbany to Pontotoc was broadened\nsome time last year. In a short while\nthe “Doodle Bug” will be only a mem\nory in Mississippi. Hundreds who\ntraveled the road and knew its owners,\nofficers and operatois in the past will\nevince a feeling of regret that the on\nward march of progress has necessi\ntated the elimination of this little\npiece of road and pushed into the back\nground the affable and accommodating\nmen who controlled its destinies in\nthe past. Such however is the price\nwe must pay for the greater advant\nages of an advance along all lines.\nYale “Doodle Bug.”\nMore Truck Faming.\nFarmers in the Saratoga section\nare busy preparing for another crop.\nMore attention will be given to corn,\npotatoes, peas, cane and such other\nnecessary crops for home use, and less\nattention to cotton than for many\nyears. Plenty of “hog and hominy”\nand less cotton is the motto. Consid\nerable trucking will be carried on, and\nmany towns along the Gulf & Ship Is\nland Railroad will ship large quanti\nties of the various vegetable crops to\nthe northern markets this year.\nTruck Experimenting.\nAckerman will begin trucking on a\nsmall scale this season. An experienced\nman lias been employed to supervise\nthe planting and cultivating as well as\nthe garnering or me crops, oucceao\nthis year will insure a much larger\nplanting next, and with the precau\ntions taken, there seems to be no rea\nson why the experiment should not\nprove a success.\nBaby Left On Door.\nA white baby boy, about 1 month\nold and in a very weak and emaciated\ncondition, was discovered on Bishop\nC. B. Galloway’s front door step. The\nonly, clew thus far brought to light\nconcerns a woman, very poorly clad\nand carrying a child in her arms, who\nwas seen to disembark from a train\nat the Union Depot.\nDetermined to Have It.\nGreenwood still continues the ag\nitation for an electric railway and now\nbelieves that it will be in operation by\nfall. There is no accounting for what\nGreenwood will and can do when the\npeople become thoroughly aroused to\nthe necessity of the thing.\nShot Through Head.\nHenry Gottsche of Ocean Springs,\ncommitted suicide by shooting himself\nthrough the head. Despondency, ter\nminating in mental derangement, is\nthought to be the cause. Mr. Gottsche\nwas about thirty years of age, and was\na resident of Ocean Springs.\nMany Brick Factories.\nWhile a round dozen large brick\nfactories were organized and put in\noperation in the state last year, sever\nal times that number of private plants\nwere built and still there is a never\nending demand that the plants can’t\nwell supply. This is an indication that\ni more substantial buildings are being\nerected than ever before\nThe Price.\nWhat great thing e’er was won without\na fight,\nA struggle fierce and long, unequal war\nAnd those attendant shadows black a*\nnight\nThat hover ’round while hope gleam*\nfaint and far?\nWhat gave Leander for love’s transient\nbliss.\nAn hour with her who waited by th«\nshore\nTo greet him smile for smile and kiss foi\nkiss\nAnd pledge to him her love forever\nmore?\nWhat cost this him?

Items of Interest from all Quarters.\nw By H. I. BLAKESL1R, Jackson, HUt.J\nOne of the most interesting exhib\nits at the Com & Cotton Carnival was\nthat of the cassava plant, the grow\ning of which is one of the new indus\ntries along the Gulf & Ship Island\nroad between Jackson and Gulfport.\nIt is cultivated for its starchy root,\nwhich is used extensively for food and\nfor stock feed and for the manufac\nture of starch. It is a native of Bra\nzil and is classified by the department\nof agriculture as a member of the\nmilk weed but when growing might be\ntaken for a shrub variety of buckeye.\nIt grows from mtwelve to fourteen\nfeet high and branches repeatedly,\nmaking a plant of rare beauty that is\nboth ornamental and useful. Prof. S.\nM. Tracy, special agent of the United\nStates’ department of agriculture, bu\nl-eau of plant industry, who sent a\nnumber of fine specimens of cassava to\nthe Carnival, says: “During the last\ntwo years a great amount of work has\nbeen done in a study of cassava, es\npecially in attempting to find the most\nproductive varieties, and also to find\nvarieties which may extend the possi\nble limit of its cultivation to locali\nties further North. At the present, its\ncultivation is limited to Florida and\nthe immediate Gulf coast, but it is\nmore than possible that, by selecting\nseed from the earliest maturing sorts,\nand by continued cultivation in cooler\nregions, its area for profitable culti\nvation may be greatly extended. Up\nto about two years ago only two varie\nties were known in the United States,\nthough fifty or more varieties were\n_J 1A mnmnnn\nThese varieties differ greatly in the\nrelative porprotions of starch which\nthey contain, some having double the\namount found in others. Of course\nthe varieties having the greatest per\ncentage of starch in the roots is the\none which is most profitable for culti\nvation. In the work which we are do\ning we have secured a large number\nof varieties from Porto Rico, Jamai\nca, and other tropical countries, and\nI now have forty-two distinct varie\nties growing on my place at Biloxi.\nThe principal practical uses of cassa\nva in this country are for the manu\nfacture of starch, and for feeding cat\ntle and hogs. In Florida there are now\nthree large factories for manufactur\ning starch, -which is used mostly for\nsizing by the manufacturers of cot\nton goods. Excepting in the imme\ndiate region of a starch factory, the\ncrop is grown for stock feed, and for\nthat purpose is growing very popu\nlar in all the Gulf coast region. As a\nfeed it takes the place of corn, and as\nits yield is much greater, while ex\npense for cultivation is about the\nsame, it is much more profitable. This\nseason I had forty-two varieties grow\ning at Biloxi, and now have a chemist\nengaged in making analysises to de\ntermine the relative value of the dif\nferent sorts. I have already made ar\nrangements for the importation of a\nlarge number of different varieties\nfrom South America, and propose to\nfollow up the work in every possible\ndirection until we are able to demon\nstrate that the crop is one that may be\nmade profitable in certain parts of the\ncountry—or that is it worthless. We\nare making no attempt to ‘boom’ it,\nand we are endeavoring to state noth\ning but demonstrated facts, what we\nam trvinp1 to do is to learn the real\ntruth regarding its value. From what\nwe have already learned we do not\nhesitate to recommend the crop for\nnearly all of Florida, and for many\nother localities along the coast, but\nwe are not ready to say how far North\nit may be grown, or what may be the\nbest methods for its treatment. It\nis a problem upon which we are\nworking, but one which has not as\nyet been solved.”\nT. E. Waldrop, Secretary of the\nSouthern Truck Growers League is\nbusily engaged in organizing truck\ning associations throughout Southeast\nMississippi. A number have been got\nten on foot and especial interest will\nbe shown the industry during the com\ning year. Handlers will be placed at\nseveral of the important cities of the\nNorth and every precaution taken to\nget the best prices for the product.\nThis is the largest trucking organiza\ntion in the state, and the plan decided\nupon for handling the business insures\nits success. No commission men are\nconsidered at all. With its own agents\nin the market, the stuff is sold at pre\nvailing prices, cutting out middle men\nand speculation. This is the proper\nmanner in which to make truck grow\ning a success.\nMendehall in Simpson county and\nCrenshaw in Panola county have been\nraised by proclamation of the govern\nor from villages to towns. They have\n500 and 400 inhabitants respectively.\nIt is an off week when one or more vil\nlages are not raised to towns and with\nfrequency the proclamation is invoked\nto make towns. The country is being\npopulated in proportion to sustain the\ngrowing towns.\nCorinth has always had the reputa\ntion of enforcing the existing laws\nwith stringency and has come to the\nfront recently with aonther order of\nenforcement that causes some to com\nplain. Laws are made to be enforced\nand if the people do not likfe them or\nbelieve them to be unjust, they should\nbe repealed, not allowed to be broken\nwith impunity. The officers of Corinth\nare doing exactly right in stHbtly en\nThe good old county of Wilkin\nson, lying in the extreme South West\nern corner of the State, was well rep\nrepsented at the Com and Cotton Car\nnival and its progressive citizenship\nmanifested their energy and enterprise\nin a manner highly creditable. True,\nthe exhibit was not so large and com\nprehensive as some, still the quality of\nproducts shown were well up with any\nthing from any section of the State.\nCenterville was the place from which\nthe greater part of it emanated, and\nthe room set apart for its use was well\ndisplayed and made attractive in ev\nery way. The most atractive feature\nof this exhibit was the products of\nthe Red Snapper Sauce Co., which is\ndomiciled at Centreville and is a red\nhot proposition in more ways than one.\nEvery conceivable kind of relish, con\ndiment, sauce, etc., was shown in the\ngreatest profusion. -The quality of the\ngoods shown was pronounced equal to\nanything on the market and the grand\nprize was aocorded them. It was\ncreditable indeed to the live gentle\nmen who constitute the company, and\ntheir efforts will result in substantial\nbenefit to all concerned. In the large\nlist of fresh vegetables shown, the\nnew crop of Irish potatoes were the\nbest at the Carnival and the grand\nprize was awarded this exhibit also.\nThey were second crop and as smooth\nand perfect as ever seen in the south.\nSome exceptionally fine hay was in\nthis room and many were the compli\nmentary expressions heard concern\ning it. It was a revelation to many\n... . ... 111 1.1\nmai sueii a quality cuuiu ue piuuuwu\nin the state. New beets of large size\nand fine texture were also shown, prov\ning the claim that in that section it\nwas possible to have vegetables the\nwhole year round. Canned goods of\nvaried kinds were shown and were\nrichly deserving of complimentary\nmention. Wilkinson county is well\nadapted to the raising of fruits and\nvegetables, and the canning factory is\na protection against loss from any\ncause. Sugar cane of splendid pro\nportion composed part of the exhibit\nand also rice, oats and other farm\nproduce. It was a magnificent demon\nstration of what can be accomplished\nin our favored land when the effort is\nmade. Pity ’tis that some-of the teem\ning thousands of people in the crowd\ned East could not have seen this, a\ngood living and comfortable homes in\nthe South in exchange for a small\namount of labor.\nIt seems that along with the pros\nperous times which have come to our\nState, and from all indications they\nhave come to stay, there has also come\nan army of grafters, humbugs and\nconfidence men. The operations of\nthis gentry is not all confined to the\ncities and towns. Numbers of them\nare working among the farmers who\nare well fixed financially. It might be\nwell for our people to continue as\nthey have in the past, bite at nothing\nuntil its merit and good faith has been\nproven. Jones county has experienced\na loss from the work of a man who\npretended to represent one of the big\nNorthern concerns. Goods were\noffered at a ridiculously low\nprice and a portion of the\ngoods never came and the man had\ngone. Chimerical gold, silver, oil,\ntownsite and other bonds are being\noffered and there are suckers to take\nthem in and are in turn taken in. It is\nstill the best plan to buy your goods\nfrom Mississippi merchants and in\nvest yuur surplus easu 111 iviisoioaippi\ninvestments. Fight shy of the man who\noffers so much for so little money for\nninety times out of a hundred all you\nget is dearly bought experience.\nJ. W. Langley of Jackson gave an\nexemplification of intensive farming\nand the splendid results at the Carni\nval. In a very small space he exhib\nited a variety of articles from his farm\nthat m^de a most creditable showing.\nThere were new crop Irish potatoes\nthat were hard to beat on any part of\nthe ground. ’Turnips of immense size\nand uniformity of shape. Rutabeggas,\nnew crop cabbages, sweet potatoes and\nother vegetables. His com was large\nand perfectly formed. Pop com of\nseveral different varieties and sugar\ncom for table use were specialties.\nMr. Langley is a successful farmer and\nhis exhibit marked him as such.\nThe report of the Superintendent of\nSenatobia’s municipal light and wa\nter plant is very gratifying to the cit\nizens of that place.

Sim\nply because they have neglected them\nselves. Ovarian and womb troubles\nare certainly on the increase among\nthe women of this country—they oreep\nupon them unawares, but every one of\nthose patients in the hospital beds had\nplenty of warning in that bearing\ndown feeling, pain at left or right of\nthe womb, nervous exhaustion, pain in\nthe small of the back, leucorrhoea, diz\nziness, flatulency, displacements of the\nwomb or irregularities.
