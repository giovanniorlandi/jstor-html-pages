        <pre>['KENDRICK GAZETTE\nVolume 22.\nKendrick, Latah County, Idaho, January 17 , 1913 .\nNumber 2.\nODD FELLOWS AND\nREBEKAHSJNTERTAIN\nAnnual Roll Call and Ban\nquet-Excellent Pro\ngram\nSaturday evening the annual roll\ncall for the Odd Fellows lodge and\nRebekah order of this city was held.\nAbout 125 were present. The pro\ngram was well arranged, the Ken\ndrick orchestra furnished some ex\ncellent music, after which several\nnames were called and those who\nwere present responded to the call.\nMr. Compton and his sister then re\nsponded with music by the violin\nand piano, after which the roll call\ncame for the Rebekahs and the\nladies answered in turn. When in\nthe middle of this call Miss Jessie\nGrinolds sang a solo. When the\nroll call was finished another solo\nwas sang by James Millison. After\nthe program was over those present\nwere then taken to the banquet room\nwhere the ladies had spread the\ntable with all the good things to eat\nthat one could ask for. Amongst\nthe articles of food on the tables\nwas found some wild ducks which\nwere fine and it was decided that N.\nC. Thomas was a good marksman\nfor he had killed them, as it was\nsupposed, and not a shot had en\ntered the body of any of them. One\nthing that was noticeable was that\nsome of the cakes were Surely good\nas the two "Big Bills" in the crowd\ntried to see which could eat the most\nof them. After everyone had satis\nfied the longings of the inner man\nthey returned to the lodge room\nwhere the remainder of the evening\nwas spent in playing games of vari\nous kinds. It was learned the next\nmorning that some of the members\nthat had come without their wives\nforgot how late it was until the\nmorning sun was seen climbing up\nover the hill. In fact it was one of\nthe most enjoyable events of the\nseason. The Rebekahs and wives\nof Odd Fellows are to be compli\nmented upon the feast that was\nserved. The members who are al\nways in attendance at the regular\nmeetings of the order request that\nthe other members turn out more\nand make every meeting as pleasant\nas the one last Saturday evening.\nElectric Line to Asotin\nLewiston, Idaho, Jan. 14.— F. L.\nSturm, who has secured franchises\nfor the operation of an electric line\nin Lewiston and Clarkston has asked\nfor a franchise over Asotin county\nroads. The franchise was presented\nto the county commissioners of Aso\ntin county on January 6, and the\ntinal hearing set for February 11.\nThe line as indicated by the fran\nchise gives a very effective service\nfor Vineland and Clarkston Heights.\nIn presenting the matter to the com\nmissioners the statement was r ade\nby Mr. Sturms\' attorney that the\nline to Asotin would probably be\nundertaken as soon as the construc\ntion in Lewistop and Clarkston was\nbegun, and thal the main trunk line\nwas so laid out as to give the best\nservice to the district and to enable\nthe Clarkston Heights to be reached\nat a minimum expense. Both the\ncounty and town of Asotin franchises\nprovide for operation within eight\neen months, while tbe Lewiston and\nClarkston franchises provide for op\neration by Aug. 1, 1913.\nDied at Age of 81.\nDaniel Benjamin was born Oct. 9,\n1832, at Fort Wayne, Indiana, and\nwhen but a small boy he with his\nparents went to Illinois and remained\nthere until 1859, when he went to\nDunlap, Iowa, where he resided un\ntil about five years ago when he\ncame to Little Bear Ridge, where he\nwas at the time of his death, Sun\nday, Jan. 12, 1913. On May 25,\n1862, he was married to Miss Mary\nLyons, of Dunlap, Iowa, and to\nthis union three sons were bora,\nJohn, Jess and Robert. Thursday\nthe remains were taken to Iowa for\nburial, it being the old gentleman\'s\nlast request to be laid at rest beside\nhis companion who had gone before\nhim. The body was accompanied\neast by John Benjamin, with whom\nhe was living at the time of death.\nCarriers Thank Patrons\nMail carriers on the two routes\nout of this place experienced the\nhardest trips Monday of any time\nsince they have been carrying the\nmail. The boys report that the pa\ntrons on each route surely did their\npartin helping them to make the\nthrough trip. Teams with plows\nand big sleds were out making trails\nahead of them nearly all the way\naround the route. Monday evening\nthe boys both expressed themselves\nas being very thankful to the people\nfor the manner in which they were\nhelped.\n42,500 Pounds of Beans\nThis week B. F. Fleshman and\nsons delivered to the Kendrick Ware\nhouse & Milling Co., 42,500 pounds\nof No. 1 beans. The price paid\nwas $3.85 per hundred straight.\nThese men are prosperous farmers\non the Potlatch and do farming in\nthe right manner and at the right\ntime and now they are reaping the\nreward.\nRev. Hand Found Guilty\nThe Rev. Hand was found guilty\nin the county court last week of the\ncharge placed against him by Hazel\nBenedict of a statutory crime. The\ntrial lasted four days and at the end\nthe jury was out over eleven hours\nand returned with the verdict of\nguilty. The judge withheld sentence\ntill a later date.\nBrave Men\nEngineer House and Fireman\nKeiber on the helper engine have\nbeen having all the snow rides this\nweek that they want and in order to\nwarm things up a little they played\nfiremen at the city of Bovard, House\nwas plug man and Kieber held the\nnozzle »\nKicked By a Cow\nWhile John Sandburg was taking\ncare of his cows Monday morning\none of them kicked him on the leg\nbetween the knee and foot and broke\nit. John was alone at the time and\nhe crawled to the house and got to\nthe telephone and called Dr. Hoyt,\nwho went to his assistance at once.\n;\nj\nTheo. Riley and wife went to\nClarkston Wednesday to visit Mrs.\nRiley\'s sister, who is in the hospital\nat that place.\nSeveral farmers of Cedar Creek\nwere in town Wednesday and report\nthe snow as being over three feet on\nthe level.\nF RflRAH RF* I\n\' 1 n I ML I\nri rPTrn PryATDP\nLLLII I Lu uClin I Ull\nBorah Gets Every Republican\nVote—Ailshie Leads\nShort Term\nBoise, Jan. 14.—Senator W. E.\nBorah was re-elected U. S. senator\nby the Idaho legislature today. The\nvote was: Borah 75, George W.\nTannehill 5, K. I. Perky 2.\nMr. Borah received the vote of\nevery republican member present\nand no other member of the party\nwas mentioned in opposition to him.\nHe was placed in nomination by\nJohn W. Hart in the senate, and by\nCharles F. Koelsh in the house.\nThe result of the ballot was greeted\nwith general applause.\nFor the short term, to fill the va\ncancy caused by the death of Wel\ndon B. Heyburn, the initial ballot\nuncovered no surprise. Judge Ail\nshie led with 25 votes to his credit,\nwith James H. Brady close upon his\nheels with a vote of 23. The other\nvotes were scattered, with no candi\ndate looking especially danperous.\nIt would have required 42 votes\nto elect, or 17 more than were cast\nfor Judge Ailshie, the high candi\ndate. No radical change from the\ninitial vote is predicted when the\nhouses ballot in joint session tomor\nrow. Democrats developed the line\nof cleavage between the two wings\nof the party in their votes for sena\ntor. Two voted for Perky and five\nfor Tannaeill for the long term. Two\nvoted for Dubois and five for Nu\ngent for the short term. The nam\ning of Dubois in both house and\nsenate caused surprise.\nSuspect In Moscow Jail\nAt Bovill, the night before Christ.\nmas, a gang of fellows stopped the\nwind on Mr. Taylor, cashier of\nGrant & Giles mercantile house, and\nrelieved him of the cash receipts of\nthat day. The loss to Mr. Taylor\nand the gain to the foot pads was\nconsiderable. The matter caused\nconsiderable speculation and com\nment, and some legal effort is being\nmade to find the perpetrators of the\ndastardly deed. To this end there\nwas lodged in jail recently one C. V. |\nHensley, who is suspected of being\nable to tell how the thing happened\n"when his tongue is loosed."\nTogether with Louis Leguarre,\nHensley makes the sixth star board\ner in Latah county jail.\n.\nWalter McCrea and Chas.

E. Wilcox went to Lewis\nton Tuesday.\n^ ow ^ ee p wa* th® snow?\nEstimates greatly differ in regard\nto tbe de P th of recent snow fall.\nOne man will declare upon his oath\nand past record for truth and verac\nity that we had only 14 inches of\nsnow. His neighbor just across the\nroad, who is also a truthful man, a\ngood judge of poor whiskey and a\nclose observer of weather conditions\nand other things in general, includ\ning his neighbor\'s chicken house and\nwood shed, states emphatically that\nthere was at least 18 inches of snow.\nAt last, but not least, here comes\nthe old pioneer, who has lived in\nthis community \'nigh on to 30 years,\nand who in all this time never seen\nso much snow. Well, to be sure,\nhe knows how much snow there\nwas. There was exactly 21 inches,\n\'cause he measured it with a stick\n\'afore it was shoveled off the cellar\ndoor, and Mary Ann she said there\nwas about that much on top of the\nold rain barrel we used last summer.\nAnd there you are. But the man\nwho used the shovel last Sunday\ncomes pretty near knowing about\nhow deep the snow was in his im\nmediate vicinity. We believe G. P.\nBaraum or E. C. Hardison could\ngive a fair estimate.\n"Along the Kennebec"\nbUies.\nA New England play entitled\n"Along the Kennebec" will be pre\nsented at the Kendrick Opera House,\nMonday, Jan. 20. This company\ncarnes all its own scenery for the\nproduction and its stage settings are\nsaid to be extraordinarily pretty and\nwell appointed. The play itself is a\ncomedy pure and simple, with an\nabsence of cheap sensationalism,\nbut an abundance of good clean\ncomedy, something that we can\nlaugh at and not understand after\nwards what we laughed at. The\nfunny duel scene in the third act is\nsaid to be a pretty good cure for the\nCome Out Citizens\n, .\nThe Commercud Club meeting\ncalled for Tuesday evening has been\nP° st P° ned until next Tuesday even\ning \' the change being made on ac\ncou " t of .

The house was\npac ked and everyone seemed to en\njoy the performance. The manager\nof the house is to be complimented\nupon be ; n g ab j e t0 secure sucb b ; gb\nclass performances. We are assured\nof another treat next Monday night\nwhen " Along the Kennebec" will be\npresented.\nFound Dead on Trail\nNews reached Kendrick yester\nday that Weldon Compton found\nthe dead body of Chas.

The\nestate owns aside from the Lewiston\nproperty farm lands in the district\nthat the new road will serve. "Our\nestate company," said Mr. Grostein\n___\nyesterday _ - has cheerfully made\nth ; s subscr ; p tion to the road and\nhopes Mr _ j obnson will be able tQ\ncarry out bis p j ans> g ucb a road\nwiH be of wonder f u i value t0 tbe\ncountry( and every person sbou i d do\neverytb ; n g possible to assist Mr.\nJohnson. Considering the large\nsums he must expend to build the\nline contemplated and considering\nthe enhanced values that will come\nto all property through the construc\ntion of such a line, I consider the\nsubscription of $150,000 asked is\nnot at all unreasonable. If the pro\nject as contemplated is realized, we\nare not giving, we are receiving, and\nshould look upon Mr. Johnson as a\nbenefactor of the community. I am\nglad to see that Lewiston people\nhave shown a disposition to welcome\nand encourage him.\n-\nTraveling Rough Road\nThe bootleggers of Latah county\nare not numerous and what few there\nare seem to be traveling on rough\nroads. Every man ot this type\nseems to fall, sooner or later, into\nthe clutches of Sheriff Brown and\nlÿs assistants. We have all read of\nthe dove sent out of the ark by\nNoah, and the rum venders will soon\nbe like that historical bird—no dry\nplace on which to rest his feet.

The skillful\nshepherd can hide the defects of bis\nsheep so that they are not apparent to\nthe eye, and only the experienced judge\ncan discover them. Sheep cannot be\njudged without feeling of them. The\nJudge must use his hands far more\nthan his eyes. The novice Is often de\nceived by the way the sheep Is trim\nmed. Often the sheep appears to be\nfat when It is thin.\nAfter the sheep have been trimmed\nthey usually are blanketed. The\nblankets keep them clean and prevent\nthem from rubbing their wool, which\nPhotograph by Oregon Agricultural col\nlege.\nJUDGING 8HKKP AT AGRICULTUBAL OOL\nLiCOX.\nwould undo all the work of the shep\nherd.

In this section of\nIdaho the snow drops have been\ncoming down plentifully of late and\nas a reuit we are confronted with\nabout two feet of the congealed\nmoisture, much to the detriment of\nrailroad traffic and the inconven\nience of local pedestrians.\nLast Sabbath day was very pa\ntriotically observed by the male\npopulation of Kendrick.

"The ground needs lime,\'\' says\nanother. "Poor underdraluage," says\na third. But here comes H. W. Wiley\nof Washington, the fumous food ex\npert, who tells us In the Rural New\nYorker that It is due to a peculiar sort\nof louse tbat is very fond of feeding\non alfalfa. Here Is what be says:\n"A year ago last spring I sowed four\nacres of alfalfa on my farm In Lou\ndoun county. Va. Tbe plot bearing\nthe alfalfa lLs just at the foot of the\nBlue Ridge, on tbe east side, and Is a\ngood quality of soil. The plot was\ncarefully prepared by deep plowing,\nthorough stirring of tbe surface and a\nprevious treatment with two tons of\nlime per acre. The germination was\nalmost perfect and the growth phenom\nenal.\n"Suddenly, about the first week In\nJune, when the young alfalfa was two\nor three Inches high, the whole plot\nbegan to turn yellow. I thought It\nwas due to fungus and brought sam\nples to the bureau of plant Industry at\nWashington.\n"It wus examined by the specialist\non plant physiology, but no fungus\ncould be found. They did say. how\never, that Innumerable Insects were\nfound among the leaves and stems. I\ntherefore took samples to Dr. Howard,\nehtomologist of the department. He\nwas delighted In discovering a special\nalfalfa louse, of which he had often\nheard but never had seen. In his opin\nion the production of zanthophyll was\ndue to Impoverishment of the plant by\nthe extraction of the sap by these lice.\nI would suggest to farmers who notice\nthis appearance to examine their alfal\nfa for lice."\nFILLS A HENHOUSE NEED.\nHere\'s an Easily Made and Simpla\nFeeding Trough For Poultry.\nOne of tbe greatest needs Id a hen\nhouse Is a dry. clean trough for feeding\nshell, grit, bran or the dry ration.

Insert a trough\nrunning back and slanting to the out\nside clapboards. Allow tbe front edge\nof tbe trougb to come a little above\ntbe opening In the wall so tbe feed will\nnot overrun. With a coal scuttle the\ntrougb may be easily filled, and tbe\nhens cannot waste or get on top of\ntbe trougb and foul it\nI have three In my bouse for grit\nshell and bran during tbe winter.\nWhere one feeds grains and thinks It\nbest to keep a hopper before the fowls\nall tbe time this plan will be liked, as\nIt takes up no room whatever. If one\'s\nhouse Is not celled tbe boxes may be\nput on the outside of the bouse wttb\ntroughs running through. The tops of\nthe boxes should slant so the rain will\nrun off. These, of coursé, will have to\nbe filled from the outside. With this\nplant the feed drops down as fast as\nthe beus remove It from the troughs.\nGood neighbors may sometimes\nbe evolved from poor ones by\nproperly planting and caring for\na few rods of fencing.\nAround the Hennery.\nHere Is where so many people fall\ndown In the hen business. They will\nnot feed well while the hens are "dry."\nCharcoal Is not a food, though fowls\ngain In flesh and eggs during Its use.\nIt simply puts them and keeps them la\na good condition for work.\nImpure nir, as well as dampness.\nIs a danger to any flock. Separate\nthe flock In bunches of twenty-five or\nfifty and feed them separately, and\nthey will make much better gains.\nWith the possible exception of broil\ners, enpous produce the highest priced\nchicken meat on the market. They fre\nquently bring as high ns 40 cents a\npound and never less thnn 20 cents.\nDuring tbe winter months the poul\ntry houses are npt to get damp, and\nsome kind of absorbent material should\nbe used on the floors of the poultry\nhouses and under the roosts. Nothing\nexcels dry dirt for this purpose.\nRemember thnt If the hens do not\nhave n full supply of grit the food will\nnot puss through tbe gizzard as It\nshould. The gizzard and the passage\nway from the crop to the gizzard be\ncome dogged, and many n fowl die»\nsimply from wnnt of material to grind\nits food. Keep grit before the fowl»\nat ali tin**»\nWHY CHICKENS PAY. \'\nEight Arguments In Favor of Poultry\nRaising by the General Farmer.\nA well knowD Canadian professor at\nOttawa, In reply to the question, "Wby\nIs poultry valuable to the farmer?"\ngave the following reasons:\nBecause he ought by this means to\nconvert a great deal of the waste of his\nfarm Into money In tbe shape of eggs\nand chickens for market.\nBecause with Intelligent management\nhens ought to be all year revenue pro\nducers, with the exception of perhaps\ntwo months during the molting period.\nBecause poultry will yield him a\nquicker return for his capital invested\nthan any of the other departments of\nagriculture.\nBecause the manure from the poul\ntry house will make a valuable com\npost for use in either vegetable garden\nor orchard. The birds themselves, If\nallowed to run In plum or apple or\nchard, will destroy all Injurious Insect\nlife. 1\nBecause, while cereals and fruits can\nonly be successfully grown in certain\nsections, poultry can be raised for ta\nble use or layers of eggs in all parts\nof the country. - 1\nBecause poultry raising Is an em\nployment In which the farmer\'s wife\nand daughters can engage and leave\nhim free to attend to other depart\nments.\nBecause it will bring the best return\nin the shape of new laid eggs during\nthe winter season, when the farmer has\nmost time on his hands. |\nBecause to start poultry raising on\nthe farm requires little or no capital.\nUnder any circumstances, with proper\nmanagement, poultry can be made with\nlittle cost a valuable adjunct to the\nfarm.

It la easily ap\nplied, Inexpensive and very effective.\nThe treatment consists of treating\nthe seed with a solution of commer\ncial formalin In water. Commercial\nformalin, which to a 40 per cent solu\ntion of formaldehyde gas In water, may\nbe bought by the pint or in bulk at a\ncost of 00 cents to 91 per pound, and\none pound (10 ounces avoirdupois) will\ntreat twenty-live to fifty bushela of\ngrain. Tbe formalin solution should\nbe guaranteed to contain 40 per cent of\nformaldehyde gas by volume. If there\nPhotograph by United States department\nof agriculture.\nSMUT or OATS, SHOWING A SMUTTED HEAD\nAMD FOB COMPARISON A SOUND OAT HEAD.\nIs any doubt as to Its strength a half\npint sample should be sent to the state\nagricultural station for analysis.\nThis formalin Is mixed with water at\nthe rate of one pound of formalin to\nevery forty-five gallons of water. If\ntbe grain Is sown Immediately after\ntreatment considerably more than usu.\nal should be sown to the acre, as the\nwater absorbed causes the grain to\nswell.\nSprinkling is one of the most con\nvenient methods of using the formalin\ntreatment The seed is placed on a\nclean floor or canvas In a pile or layer\nseveral Inches thick. It Is then sprin\nkled with the formalin solution by\nmeans of an ordinary sprinkling can\nor spraying machine and Is shoveled\nover and over until every kernel Is\nthoroughly wet The grain is then\nplaced in a pile and covered with\nsacks, blankets or a tarpaulin for two\nhours or overnight. It Is then dried\nsufficiently to run through the drills,\nafter which It may be sown.—Bulletin\nUnited States Department of Agricul\nture.\n1 FORM AN ANTI-WEED TRUST.\no -\n2 Every farmer ought to take\n• pride In destroying weeds. Farm\n2 ers. In fact, ought to work in\n• unison toward preventing all\n• pestiferous weeds from going to\nJ seed on their lands. If they\no would only combine and form a\n• "trust" for ihls purpose, there Is\ne no legislation that would kick,\n2 and greatly would they be bene\no fited by It.\nThe Gain Colta Should Make.\nThe average farm colt should make a\ndully gain of at least two pouuds. Also\ngood colts can be raised when the\nmares are working. A colt should weigh\nat ten months one-half Its weight at\nmaturity.—Farm and Fireside.\nWith the Wax and Honey Makers.\nI Bees winter better If they have part\nhoney and part sugar to live ou during\n; cold weather.\nLook out fur the weak colonies of\nbees and give them honey from those\nI that have more than they ueed. Tliou\n: sauds of colonies starve to death every\n{ winter. If you feed the bees sirup be\n; sure It is not too thin or trouble will\nI result. Three parts water and four\n! parts sugar will be about the right tnix\n! turq.\nIt is economy to buy hives in the flat\nand put them together at leisure time,\n, rather tliau to buy them all nailed nud\nj painted, as the latter cost about one\nj third more. Even a novice can put\n! hives together without trouble, as ma\nchine made hives are so accurately cut\nthat aTl parts Bt easily and interchange\nably.—Farm Journal.\nThroughout the winter period of in\nactivity It Is best to keep tbe bees as\nquiet as possible. After providing for\ntheir comfort by properly bousing and\nsheltering them it Is best to let them\nseverely alone during frosty weather.\nIt will be Important however, to watch\nthe entrances to the hives and keep\nthem open. There Is danger of these\nopenings becoming stopped up with\ndead bees, even when only a small per\ncentage of the cluster meet their death\nIn winter.—Country Gentleman.\nWHAT\'S IN A FARM NAME?\nEvery Comfortable Homestead la\nWorth Ite Own Distinctive Title.\nEvery good man and woman has a\ncherished memory of the old home\nwhere childhood\'s days were spent, and\nIf that old home was on a farm that\nfarm should have a name that will\ndistinguish It from all other farme of\nthe county.\nNearly every other business house,\nfactory or Arm has adopted a name and\na credit la established. Every farm to\nworthy of a name, and every farmer\ncan make a reputation and establish a\ncredit for his farm and Its products\nthrough Intelligent, careful study and\nthe adoption of approved modern meth\nods of procedure.\nA well chosen name lenda dignity to\na place and la a sort of trademark\nwhich distinguishes It and Its products;\nIt characterizes Its owner as a man of\npride and stimulates all who are inters\nested in It or Its products to do and to\nbe the best\nWe believe that a well selected name\nwill furnish an Incentive for better\nfarming; that all Implements, tools, ve\nhicles, crates and products whenever\npossible should have the name of tbe\nfarm Indelibly stamped upon them; that\nIt should adorn every entrance to the\nfarm and be printed upon all stationery\nused on the farm. We believe that the\nname should relate to some distinct\nfeature of the farm, Its location, topog\nraphy or products.—Illinois Farmers\'\nInstitute.\nFeeding Value of Pumpkins.\nPumpkins are about 90 per cent wa\nter. It has been estimated that two\nand one-half tons of pumpkins equal In\nfeeding value about one ton of silage\nand that twenty pouhds of pumpkins\ncontain as much digestible protein as\na pound of corn. The principal value\nof pumpkins lies In their succulence\nand as a part of the ration are valua\nble for all kinds of live stock.—Kansas\nFarmer.\nLabor Saving Log Roller.\n• Farmers In the future will not •\n2 be so anxlons to manage large 2\n• farms, but will be more concern- •\n• ed in securing large yields per 2\n• acre. Science is teaching what •\n2 can be accomplished by the Intel- *\n• llgent use of manure and fertl- •\n• lizers so that the yield of our •\n2 farms may be increased.—Farm J\n• and Ranch. *\nOn every farm where there Is timber\nof large size there ought to be a cant\nhook, an Implement shown In the pic\nture. for the purpose of moving heavy\nlogs, says Home and Farm, from which\npicture and description are taken. It\nwill save a tremendous amount of\nheavy lifting, and one man with a cant\nhook can do as much, or even more,\nthan two without It The handle should\nbe about five feet- long and the Iron\nhook about twelve inches, or If very\nlarge logs are to lie used fifteen Inches.\nThe hook should work loosely on a bolt\nthrough the handle and the "business\nend" be slightly curved Inward and al\nways kept sharp.\nHog Cholera Prevention.\nNo specific cure has been found for\nhog cholera, but iu a few instances re\ncoveries have taken place where tbe\npreventive serum has been promptly\nused The serum, if fresh made and\nfrom a reputable, reliable manufactur\ner, Is effective in preventing tbe dis\nease. Temporary immunity Is bad by\ntbe single Injection treatment In which\nserum alone is used. Permanent im\nmunity is had by injecting serum and\na very small quantity of virulent blood\nat the same time.\nPumpkins For Dairy Cows.\nPumpkins are good feed for dairy\ncows, and there is nothing in tbe claim\nthat they will dry animals up. It can\nbe said that field pumpkins coutatn\npractically the same amount of digesti\nble nutrients as turnips.\nS\nATURDAY\nPECI AL\nA Clean-Up On\nSHAWLS\nBeginning SATURDAY we\npositively offer our entire regular\nline of Shawls at a real\n_ SALE PRICE\nWe deliver all goods from\n1 to 11 pounds within 50\nmile zone FREE\nPatronize\nyour own Mail Order House and\nplease us—we please you.\nPHONE ORDERS\nGiven Prompt and Efficient\nAttention\nTHE QUALITY STORE\nKENDRICK\nSTORE j s\n«\nCO.\nKENDRICK\nIDAHO\n$\nDon\'t Blow\nOut in the Wind\nThey are built for rugged use.\nBuilt strong and durable.\nBuilt so that they won\'t blow\nout; so that they won\'t leak and won\'t smoke.\nWhen you buy a RAYO, you buy a well-made\nlantern — the best that experts can produce.\n-jflf\nAt Dealer m Everywhere\nCONTINENTAL OIL COMPANY\nDenver, Pueblo, Albuquerque,\nCheyenne, Butte, Boiee, Sett Lake City.\nPine Creek Bench\nMrs. R.
