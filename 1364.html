THE ARDENT SUN-KISSED LAND,, 3ufc ..... ., In common with other sections of the union, yet. probably in ex, ceptional degree, Arizona has known prosperity. diifi\'ng the year .1899., Thanksgiving day was celebrated without mental reservation and the, prospect for 1900 is the brightest ever known to the Sun-Ivissed Land., This has all been despite unfavorable natural conditions, For the rain, fall during the past two years has been down to the minimum record., Farmers, lumbermen, miners and railroads alike have. been deprived,, but have kno.vn prosperity such as never before come unto them., It is believed the territory has passed its speculative - era arid that, it has entered a period wherein steady progress will be known, on a, basis of its known rich natural resources. Upon these premises appli, cation is now being made for tho right of statehood., In\'reviewing the progress of the year 1899, the inquirer is struck, with the fact that development has been generally diffused throughout, all lines, that the prosperity enjoyed has came through many Email, operations, and may not be credited to any single overshadowing cause., General conditions have favored throughout. Copper is nearly twice, the price it was eighteen rnonths ago. Range-cattle sell for 30 a head,, where $12 for the same class of steers was the price in 1898 . Sheep are, $3 a head, where they were $1.50, and wool has almost doubled in, value. The farmer and srehardist have found quick and profitable, market for all they ceuld produce. And tho merchant has prospered, with his customers. 4, The industry most active under the changed conditions ha3 been,, and is, raining. The copper production for the year will reach a total, valuation of $22,000,000, of itself two-thirds of tho territory\'s taxed val, uation on all descriptions of property. Gold production has been in the, vicinity of $8,000,000, about a million advance on the previous year., From placer claims has come about $600,000. Silver will probably be, found to run about two million ounces, mainly from the mines of Mo, have county, with some as a by-product in copper bullion. Lead, car-,, rying some-silver, is mined in southeastern Arizona, UBually (o be ship, ped as fluxing material to the El Paao smelters., Railroading in Arizona has never before been so aclivo. A new, broad-gnage line has been . built in Mohave county, to connect tha, Santa Fe Paeincwith Chloride. The expectation is that the road will, be continued on to a junction with one of the railroads in Southern, Utah. Wholly within Coconino county is a railroad now under con, struction from Williams to the Grand Canyon of Arizona. It is to be, sixty five miles long and will penetrate a rich timber and copper rain, ing district. Early in 1899 the Gila Valley, Globe & Northern Railway, a, Southern Pacific road, was completed to Globe. A narrow-guage line, is to be built at once by the Detroit Copper company from Morenci to, Duncan. The survey has been completed for a railway from Yuma to, San Jorge bay, in Mexico, on the Gulf ot California, .a distance cf 125, miles. Another Mexican line is to be built by the Scotcji copper fac, tors, Phelps, Dodge & Co., from Naco, near Bisbee, into the Cananea, mountains of Sonera. Additions have been made to the trackage of, the Prescott and .Eastern road, and . system of feeders for the line, cen, tering at Big Bug is to reach all the mining camps of the Bradshaw, mountains. A similar system with twenty-inch guage, is to center at, Globe. Along the lines of. the Santa -Fs Pacific nearly all culverts, have been replaced in masonary, and new iron bridges are being placed, at Canyon Diablo and other points. The- road beds of both the Santa, Fe and Southern Pacific trunk line3 within Arizona have been entirely, worked over during the year. Both companies have almost entirely", renewed their motive power, and both have installed heavier rails on all, grades. The Santa Fe has spent about $3,000,000 during the year in, improvement of its Arizona divisions, and the Southern Pacific is not, far behind. The latter corporation, early in the year, completed at, Yuma a. new steel bridge over the Colorado river. It. cost $500,000., Large sums have been expended by the Santa Fe Paeific in the devel, opment of water. Near Seligman and Ash Fork, at Walnut, Williams, and other points, costly dams have been built in mountain canyons to, impound the surface flows of water. ., In population, excluding Indians, the territory is rated at 100,000,, believed to be an increase ef 1200 within two years. The assessed val, uation of property is $32,509,520, an increase of $2,000,000 for the year., The. assessors\' figures count little, however. The mines alene are worth, and should be valued at $200,r0f 000. Not half the cattle and sheep, are reported, and farming land alone appears to pay up trie proper "val, uation. The Santa Fe Pacific as practically exempt from taxation, and, pays by agreement on $2500 a mile. There are also about five hundred, and twenty miles of other railroad lines wholly exempted from taxation, for a period that will expire in about ten years. The true valuation of, property within Arizona\' i\'3 nearer $303,000,000\' than it is to the pres, ent figures. ....., A feature of development that has the whole terrtory in its scope, is a long distance telephone system, on which the Sunset corap\'an)\', expending $200,000. It is to embrace every considerable town iii the., territory, with a 400-mile trunk line, by way of Tuceon, Florence, Phoenix and Preieott., Progress has been made in\' 1899 in wiping out more of the\' many, land-grant claims that once were a formidable menace, to growth and, to property titles. The United States court of private land claims has, stricken off a dozen claims during the year, arid has affirmed several, for small areas. The only grants with titles now in suspense are for, small tracts in Santa Cruz, Pima and\' Cochise cotfnties.

Shanssey was the, only candidate on the official ballot, and he received 111 votes against 20, scattering., For the council three candidates, J., H. Godfrey, Robert Tapia and H, D., Morey, were on the official ballot, C., H. Riise having announced himself, as a candidate for the office later in, the race. The balloting resulted in, the following vote : Tapia, 107 ;, Godfrey, 69; RuBe, 56; Morey, 41., Willie and Heyl are hold-overs, there, fore the new council will bo composed, of Mayor Shanssey, Councilmen Wil, lis, Heyl, Tapia and Godfrey., The offices of treasurer and assessor, went a-begging, the vole being very, much scattered. However, Althee, Modesti, the present treasurer, re, ceived the largest number of votes for, that office, and Dr. Cotter was declar, ed elected as assessor., The contest for marshal was quite, animated. Three candidates were in, the field for the office, namely, Geo., H. Miles, S. W. Bayley and A. Bien, kowski. The successful candidate, entered the contest with the same, vigor and get-up-and-getiveness that, characterizes all his movements, and, consequently he led the race by an, overwhelming majority. The vote, stood Bienkowski, 111; Miles, 28; and, Bayley, 28., PERSONNEL., The mayor, J. H. Shanssey, has, been tried and all conservative and, fair-minded citizens give him credit, for a good, sound, business adminis, tration. During his administration, Yuma has made more rapid advance, ment and the last council did more, for the city than for the past twenty, years of its existence. \'No better, choice could have been made, and it, is safe to predict -that the following, year of his incumbency will be char, acterized by honor and business in, tegrity. Councilman O. H. Willis as an old, time resident of Yuma and has held, various offices of trust in the city and, county. As a member of the council, he has alwa\'s stood for progress and, the champion of any. movement that, had for its object the advancement of, city., Councilman Ben Heyl is a roung, and energetic business man, and his, services in the last council was all, that could be desired by those citizens, who believe in the future of Yuma., During the ensuing year important, questions will arise effecting the pro, gress of the city, and Mr. Heyl will, be a valuable member of the city, government., Robert Tapia\'s popularity is attest, ed to by the large number of votes, which he received last Tuesday. He, has been a member of the council for, the past year and has always been, found on the right side of questions., The only new member of the coun, cil is J. H. Godfrey. Mr. Godfrey is, an old-time citizen and a (rusted em, ployee of the Southern Pacific com, pany. His permanent home and, business interests are in Yuma and, it is reasonable to surmise that the in, terests of the entire city will be zeal, ously guarded. Councilman Gedfrey, has the support of the business men, and citizens of Yuma., Dr. Cotter, a3 assessor, needs no in, troduction. - He has held various, positions and is at present chairman, of the board of supervisors. He had, not announced himself for the assess, orship, and the office came as a com, pliment. Althee Modesti, the present treas, urer, was re-elected as a compliment,, he also having made no announce, ment for the office. The city funds, are in safe hands., If a rustler will make a good mar, shal A. Bienkowski is the man for, the place. He has resided in Yuma, for a number of years and has always, been famous for his ability to get, there. He is a worker and will take, pride and interest in the discharge of, his official duties. Charley is popular, among all classes, and the large yote, which he polled is ample proof that, he is a favorite.

You have been eating tarn ales, and drinking stale beer in Yuma for, years; now you will move to Portland, and live on the income of your wife,, while the mule legislature is the only, thing for me."

It is the, Southwest division of the Territory, and, -one of the four original counties of the Ter, ritory. Many great reclamation projects are, however on foot, and in a few years ex, pect to see Yama County rated as the, -richest in the Territory., The first glimpse the traveler from Cali, fornia catches of Arizona is that of the, -picturesque town of Yuma, which is snugly, situated in the embrace of gentle rolling, Mill, upon whose crest and sides the, modern homos of our superior civilization, are crowding the adobe dwellings into, eternal oblivion. Yuma is the gateway o, Arizona, the new empire of the West upon, whose undeveloped riches the eyes of the, country are at present turned, and as such,, it is bound to grow and prosper with a, rapidity that at present can hardly be re, alized But coupled with her., geographi, cal position we find that she is the center, of a country whose agricultural possibili, ties are practically unlimited, being sur-, A,A fcv a soil the fertility of which, ,iw.nf the delta of the Nile, and, tinir only water to become a paradise of, w Billions of callous of that precious, .. 4- iuigf.i nt, fluid have annually gun, Yuma\'s very door, but already a reaction, fa taking place and many enterprises are, on footto supply the life-giving waters of, the yellow Colorado to the thirsty earth., HIVERS OF YUMA COUNTY,, In regard to climate, healthfulness, fer, tility and productiveness of soil, facilities, for cultivation, irrigation and. abidance of, water supply, variety of resources and, cheap transportation by rail and by water,, -o part of Arizon can surpass Yuma, county, which is destined to become one of, richest and most prosperous counties m, "k!: Wtween 32 00\' and 34" 20\' north, l.: aa 113 20\' and 114 40\' west, . . i-.nc r 4.RS 310 acres.

The, county is bounded on the north by Williams, Fork and the Santa Maria river, vhoao, waters flow into the Colorado; on the ust, u.. iVi rnnnties, of Pima, fliancopa,, UJ . !, 1,m Snnnra., Yavapai,, and on uie auuu. 3, Mexico. Its county, seat is the town oi, Yuma. , ,. ., The Colorado river drains the entire ter, ritory of Arizona, and every drop ot water, -MM, falls on its mountains and plains, .ihwuv to this mighty river. It, is, fnrmedbv the union of the Green, and, j .;.,rn fed bv the streams, which, rise in the Rocky Mountains, and.the melt, ing snows cause a greater depth of water, in this river in summer than in winter, thus, urnishins the most water at the season, henitismost required for the purposes, of irrigation and agriculture., It will be seen that for the entire distance, along its western boundary, Yuma County, .possess the great advantage of cheap, -water transoortation., TheGilariverri.es in .ne western part, Of New Mexico and is fed by numerous, streams, among the most prominent of, which are the San Pedro, Agua Fna, Has, . iayampaand Salt rivers. It flows west, through Yuma County and empties into the, Colorado at the town of Yuma., Yuma county, traversed by these great, rivers from its northern to its southern,, and from its eastern to its western bound, aries, possesses a far greater wate; supply, tfiau any other county in tht Territory,, and far more than can be found in all Cali, fornia. This water is now being diverted from its, natural channels by means of numerous, large irrigating canals, and utilized for the, purpose of reclaiming and irrigating the, immense tracts of lands which lie in this, favored country, and which are as fertile, as any in the world., The Southern Pacific Railroad crosses the, -Colorado river atfthc town of Yuma and, , runs through the county, following the, , generol course, and at an average distance, ef about four miles south, of the Gila river,, rendering all the lands susceptible of irri, nation arid cultivation, can find an easy, outlet in this way and can be transposed, tt til the markets and centers of population, , in the East or West., Another competing railroad is projected, - from-San Diego, California, to tie town, fYuma, and thence along the north side, of the Gila river. Thus Yuma County will\', rt&ve exceptional railroad advantages., THE CLIMATE OF YUMA., Tho climate of Yuma for nine1 months of, tlie year has no equal, as we believe, in the, worlds and during th remaining three, . onthVdf the year, comprising June, July,, and August\'thc heat h not oppressive, Xvea though the thermometer in mid-siim-mer, may a times rise above 100, and oc, ttsionallye en reach 110 y, owing to, the absence cf moisture in the air, it is not, oppressive. The atmosphere is pure, light, and balmy. When the mercury marks lEe, nichest extreme of heat, a person . docs not, feel that oppression or debility - which, is, ft.ja.tiieaster3States whenthe mer-J, Rivers, and Many, Offerings of, BANNER, and, cury is ranging from 80 to 90. The air is, so dry that perspiration is absorbed as soon, as it reaches the surface of the body, and, at n time in the summer does the heat, produce any discomfort., THE VILLAGE OF YUMA., Although the town of Yuma is the socond, oldest community in the Territory of Ari, zona, it is astonishing how little its re, sources are known to the world at large, and, how slightly developed is the natural-wealth, of the county. This is owing partly to, Yuma\'s reputation for unbearable heat, and, partly to the fact that, lying next to Cali, fornia, is has been assumed that the county, has been thoroughly prospected for mineral, wealth, and prospectors have, in the main,, kept the traveled highways in crossing ,its, Territory. As a matter of fact one suffers, less from the heat here than in almost all of, the settled communities of the east, owin, to the dryness of the atmosphere, and there, is no healthier climate on God\'s footstool., People labor out of door from the rising, to the setting of tho sun, and suffer no in, convenience. There, hasnevcr been known,, in this section of country, an authentic case, of sunstroke. Our climate, taken in time,, never fails to cure pulmonary complain li of, any description. Disease such as smallpcx,, cholera, etc., rarely visit us, and then only, in a very mild form, and are never fatal ex, cept through the peiversity of -patients, Contrary to the belief of the uninformed,, the dry heat of the summer months is es, pecially conducive to good health and ex-, ceptional vigor, acting naturally upon the, human system with the same effect as the, artificial result of a Turkish bath purefy, ing and renovating it. As a further matter, of fact, this county has never been even, superficially suspected, and it is onlj now, that people are beginning to search its hills, with any degree of systematic enthusiasm, for the mineral wealth hidden there. Ow, ing to the falling off in the price of silver,, deposits of gold only are being sought for;, and the present result is little short of mar, velous. In all sections of the county from, the Sonora line to Williams Fork discoveries, are daily being made, and the greater tho, development the greater the wealth dis, played. Wherever the prospector plants, his foot, ledges of gold confront him or arc, brought to light by the investigating strokes, of his pick., Portions of the country traversed for, years by commonly traveled trails are devel, oping into rich storehouses of golden wealth., New and rich placers are constantly being, discovered, and shipments of placer gold, from this point through Wells Fargo &, Co.\'s Express, arc steadily increasing in, valua. From a mining standpoint Yuma, County is rapidly leading the Territory, and, yet as far as that industry is concerned,, this\' section has received but little recog, nition. Agriculturally the country is vastly im, proving. Enterprises that have lain dor, mant the last two years, owing to the gen, eral financial depression and consequent, dearth of money for investment puroosps,, are waking up to new life and vigor. Money, is being attracted in this direction, and on, all sidu can be distinguished that indefin, able stir which is the precursor .of an indus, trial awakening. Even within these last, two jrears of financial stringency and de, pression there has been a steady if slow in, crease in agricultural development and, wealth. A greater area of old farms has, been put under cultivation, and new lands, have been inclosed and new fields started,, A large section of Blaisdell Heights has been, planted to fruit trees; field of cereals and, alfalfa have been added t the cultivated, area on the Colorado river below town; the, lands lying under the? Mohawk and Farmer\'s, canals have been made to yield heavy crops, of every variety of agricultural products, as, in other sections of the Gila valley, and the, gardens of Ynma have been added to and, beautified in fruits, flowers and shubbery to, a more than appreciable extent. Altogether, we may feel proud of our progress during, these last months of business depression and, discouragement. It speaks well for the in, dustry and pluck of our people, and the, showing made constitutes the best evidence, of the merits of our soil and climate and the, richness of our mineral resources. Nature, has done everything for our county, and all, that is needed is a touch of the wand of cap, ital to have oui hills and valleys spring into, an active life of remunerative industry that, will last and endure forever., Some three years ago, through the energy, of H. W. Blaisdell, the Yuma Water and, Light Company was incorporated, and by, means of its large pumping plant, at the, foot of M.iu street, the town is\'abundantly, supplied with water at reasonable rates, aud, there have grown into existence new and, large gardens\' and orchards;, MINES., There is no section of hc United States,, or probably of the earth, more rich in min, eral wealth than the County of Yuma. All, the country north, east and south of Yuma, lies directly within the main gold belt that, commences in Alaska and ends in Mexico, j, From the San Bernardino mountains in, California to the Sonora boundary line the, mountains and hills are exceptionally rich in, the precious metal, as though demonstrating., the theory often advanced that the richest, gpltiLmines are found; bordering the tacV.ofc, oxtlhet Oceans. The groat Colorado uescrr, was once an inland .sea, cut off centuries and, perhaps ages ago frdtn the main ocean, leav, ing its waters to evaporate in this intense, heats Throughout all fchf country border, ing, the desert, including this section, rich, mines arc being constantly discovered, and, some of recent location arc already produc, ing immense profits. In the neighborhood, of Yuma, claims exceedingly rich on the, surface are daily being located, and all signs, portend a great mining.boom for this county, which will culminate as early as the coming, fall in an inroad of much capital. Experts, are arriving every week and mines are being, bonded at more than heavy prices. It, seems wonderful to believe that all this min, eral wealth has been lying at our very doors, for so many years without a taker, but the, tendency of prospectors is to go a loi.g dis, tance off into strange lands rather than to, teek for mines .in a county as old.as Yuma, County and so accessible. The greater the, distance, the hardship, and the danger, the, greater the fascination for the prospector, Distance seems, indeed, to lend enchant, ment to the view., So it is that this county is almost a virgin, field for.thc-mine hunter, and now with the, few hundreds searching in its mountains its, mineral secrets are still in cffect.secrets, for, thousands upon thousands might be wander, ing through the rock-ribbed fastnesses of, our mountain ranges and their presence be, almost unknown, so vast is the extent of, country, Recent rich discoveries of gold deposits,, particularly in ledges, have given a great, impetus to mining throughout the county, New locations, are being constantly made,, and all show well upon the surface. The La, Fortuna mine, recently put in opeation,, has a 2)-stamp mill running night and day, and the production of gold averages $75,000, per month. This -mine is situated about 30, miles southwest of the village of Yuma., Rich gold discoveries have also been made, in Castle Dome, Harqua Hala, Centennial, Palomas, Pot Holes, and other mining dis, tricts, and, although the mining oe Icok in, the county was never better, still -jiost ot, the silver and lead mines are idle, owing, to the low value of these metals., VALLEYS OF THE COLORADO AND, - GILA., In the valleys of the Colorado and the, Gila rivers there is roem\' for thousands. It, is not too much .to say tliat nowhere within, the limits of this broad Union can be found, a more desirable region\' for the makin of a, home. No laborious clearing of the land is, repaired; it lies almost ready for the- plow., Trees and shrubbery have so rapid a growth, that within eighteen months the immig-ant, can surround his abode with attractions, which would require years to mature in less, favored climates. Fruits ripen and are, ready for market a full month before the, California products. The bright sunshine, makes life a luxury, and the pure dry atmos, phere brines health to all who inhale it. For, the establishment of colonies, such as are, made in southern California, Arizona pre, sents unrivaled opportunities. Thousands, of acres now profitless can be made produc, tive by the construction of irrigating ditches,, and there is no investment which assures, larger or more permanent returns., The statement in this-article on Yuma, county are not exaggerated; in fact they fall, short of doing justice in this wonderful bit, of country. Pineapples, dates, almonds and, walnuts will do well. Strawberries, rasp, berries, blackberries, currants, gooseberries,, and all varieties of small fruits can be suc, cessfully cultivated. Indeed, Yuma County, is not only the natural, home of the citrus, and cemitropical fruits, as almost every, fruit, nut, plant, grain, grass, or vegetable, which can be produced in either tropic of, temperate zones will thrive in the rich and, fertile soils., With the bright prospects ahead of the, town of Yuma and Yuma County there can, be no better investment for capital seeking, large and renumerative returns than is af, forded here. With a matchless climate,, where all forms of disease known to the, damp and rigorous regions of the east and, north are unknown, where the bright sun, shine kisses into bloom and fragrance every, form of vegetation, and where the clear days, and cool and balmy nights are one long-continued, poem of happiness and delight, we", can offer to capitalists an ideal field for in, vestment and to home seekers a veritable, paradise in which to settle., AR1ZOXA., Its Attractions nnd Advantages ns a, Place of Residence in Winter., Whitelaw Reid. owner and editor of the, New York Tribune, who has spent the last, two winters in Arizona for the benefit of, his health, writes entertainingly and in, structively concerning that part of the, country. Mr.. Reid Rays:, So many questions are asked about Ari, zona as a place for winter residence, and, there appears to be such a dearth of pre, cise information among many who are, vitally interested, that it seems almost a, public duty, to set down, in the simplest, form, a few facts of personal observation., WEATHER., During a five months\' residence in, Southern Arizona in winter there was but, one day when the weather made it actually, unpleasant for me . to take exercise in the, open air at some time or other during the, day. Of course there were a good many, days which a weather observer would de, scribe as "cloudy, \' und some that wore, "showery; but during these five months, (from November, 1895, to May, 1S96,), there were only four days when we did not, have brilliant sunshine at some time dur, ing the day. Even more than Egypt, any, where\' liorth of Luxor, .Arizona is the laud, of sunshine. A"s" to details:, TEMFERATCKS., Ihave seen the thermometer mark 92, degrees in the shade on my north piazza in, March: On the other hand, we had frosts, which killed young orange trees, and there, were several nightswhen thin ice formed., lhe government reports- show a mean, temperature for fourteen years at the pres, ent territorial capital of 57$ degrees in, November, 53 degreos.in December, 49 de, grees in\' January; 54 degrees in February,, 6 degrees in March aud G deg, -, Am il Tim same reports SllOW the hmllCSl, and lowest temperatures, averaged for, eight years, at the same place, as follows:, For November 78 degreesand 42 degrees,, December .73 degreesand 36 degrees,, January 65 degrees and 32 degrees, Feb, ruary 71 degrees.. and 35 de rces., March 81 degrees and 41 degreet and, April S6 degrees and 46 degrees. The, nights throughout the winter are apt to be, cool enough for open wood fires, and for, blankets. Half the time an overcoat is, not needed during the day, but it is never, prudent for a stranger to be without one, at hand, Alfc:, The atmosphere is singularly clear, tonic, and drv. I have never seen it clearer, anywhere in the world. It seems to have, about the same bracing and exhilarating, qualities as the air of the Great Sahara in, Northern Africa, or of the deserts about, Mount Sinai, in Arabia Petraea, It is, much drier than in the parts of Morocco,, Algiers or Tunis usually visited, and drier, than any part of the Valley of the Nile, north of the First Cataract. It seems to, me about the same in quality as the air on, the Nile between Assouan and Wady, Haifa, but somewhat cooler., ARIZONA., Arizona stands at the threshold of, era of wondcrfnl social an 1 industrial de, veiopment. There can\'t be a doubt about, the fact. The dawn for which she has, waited so lone is breaking at last. There, is every promise of a day of great pros, perity.aud permanent upbuilding just be, fore her. The impulse of a new and enei, gizing hope is visible everywhere among, her people, while the cumulative effect of, many things, which made but smull im, pression as they transpired singly, is now, commanding for her a full share of atten, tion and interest abroad among home-, seekers and capitalists., A lively competition has sprung up for, the possession of things which have hereto, fore gone a-begging for ownership. There, is a scramble for franchises. Nothing mors, surely indicates a great industrial awaken, ing than this. The rates of interest are, falling to moderate figures. Nothing more, surely indicates confidence and competition, among the money lend rs than this., Arizona has reached that climacticer, period which every western state has ex, perienced sometime in its history when, after long and weary struggle and doubt., with each side of the balance first up an, then down, the clouds of despondency, have suddenly rolled away, and a suntmrst, of energizing hope has thrilled the droop, ing spirits of the people to greater and, braver endeavor than before., For-the last twelve years the subsidence, of the great Tombstone boom and the com, pletion of two transcontinental lines of, railroad across her territory Arizona has, ratner dropped out of public attention,, but in that time she has been quietly ac, cumulating a fund of substantial wealth, and a force of moral character which, qualify her now to rise up and take her, destiny in her own hands., The population of Arizona is Mexican., This is a mistake of great importance from, the moral point of view. There is hut one, considerable center of Mexican population, in the territory, the city of Tucson, and, even there it is not by any means at pres, ent the predominating element. It think, it is certain that Arizona has not to-day, nearly so large a Mexican population as, Colorado and not above one-tenth a3 much, as New Mexico.-""Fitz-Mac," in Denver, News., WHY IMMIGRANTS SHOULD COME TO YUMA, COUNTY., Because the climate is perfect., Because the soil is fertile and prolific., Because land is abundant and cheap., Because a home can be made with little, labor., Because so great a variety of products, can be grown., Because the yield is large and the prices, always remunerative., Because life is a luxury in a land where, the sun shines every day ., Because tluTe arc chances for a poor man, which he can never hope to find in older, countries., Because the country is advancing and, property values are increasing., Because, unlike Southern California it, does not require a small fortune to secure a, piece of land., Because capital does not block all the av, enuos to wealth, nor crowd the poor: man, to the wall., Because Uncle Sam has yet many, farms, in Yuma .county waiting for occupants., uscause cliurcnes, schools, newspapers, and railroads are fast developing the moral, p.nd material elements of the Territory., Because good land is becoming scarce, and, if you don\'t catch on now, your last chance, will soon be gone ., Because the country is one of the few, regions of the Uuited States that yields the, products of the temperate and semi-tropic, zones., Because the worker receives a fair com, pensation for his labor, and the \'rustler\' has, a field for the display of hiB energy and en, terprise., Juecauso there are neither blizzards or, tornadoes, earthquakes nor inundations,, snow-eto:ni8 nor cyclones., Because the vast and varied resources of, the country are jret to be developed., Because the wealth of its mines, its farm, ing valleys, and grazing lands, will yet buil, up a great and prosperous county., Because a man can make a livelihood .ier,, with less labor than in any other" part of the, United States., Because there is health in every breeze,, and strength and vigor under its cloudless, skies., Because the settler need not spend a life, time in felling trees and grdbbiug eut, stumps., Because vegetation is so rapid that in two, years the home is surrounded1 by a\' growth, \'of treeB and shrubs which would require, five years to develop in a colder clime., Because fortunes here await the venture, some, and health welcomes the afflicted1. -, Because the country has a brilliant future, and you want to be in the "swim.", Because in its pure.\'dry .invigorating air,, epidemic diseases caimot live or germinate., Because its people are .\'generous, liberal,, hospitable and progiesrive,, 1\'tvUlT UULi LxlE., Fruit production throughout Arizona is a sub- \', ject o groat interest at present, and will no, doubt, be the principal industry in Yuma County., Tho remarkable results that have sDrunsr from, very superficial and imperfect culture has de, monstrated that the soil and cllmato of Yuma, County aro peculiarly adapted-for this branch of, agricultural enterprise. The development of those, resources is of the utmost importance and is at, tracting- carefnl attention. Experiments have been, made, with care, and facts in regard to the culture, of different kinds of fruits have been collected, which cannot fail to convince, even the mostskept-, ical, oftb3 ondcrful superiority of Yuma County, over Southern California in fruit growing, and, which must lead to a large and varied production,, of the most remunerative character., The Commissioner of Immigration in his report,, published in 1SS8, writes as follows of tho rich, vaUn of the. Gila, Colorado and Calt rivers., "The soil of these valleys is amoni; tho richest, on the continent. It is formed of the detritus, which the streams for ages have brought down, from their mountain homes in fheir journcr to the, sea. By constant overflows and change of channel,, the deposit of this rich vegetable matter has form, ed x soil of extreme fertility, Nearthj streams it, is a dark tlluvial mold, well adapted to small, grains and grasses. Farther back tnerc is. a rich, sandy loam, mellow and porous, and especially-, favorable for fruit culture. It has been . already, demonstrated that the productive apacity of these, valleys is not surpassed by lands of equal area in, any part of the United States. So rapid and prolific, is the growth of the fruits, cereals and vegetables, that the labor of the cultivator is reduced to the, minimum, in nearly all of them two cropt a year, can be growth, and vegetation is one month ahead, of California. The farmers plants a .cottonwood, sapling before his door, and within the year he. has, a shade tree twonty-tive feet high! Alfalfa can be, cut six times during the season, and it is an actual, fact the grape-cuttings have produced within eigh, teen months! What State or Territory can make, such a showing? The climate, it must be remem, bered, is nearly perpetual summer. Snow never, falls in these southern valleys. The farmer begins, to plant in November, and by the middle of May, harvest is ready. Roses are in bloom, fruit!, trees are blossoming, and the grain fields e a sta, of green, when the fields of the Eastern armors, are covered with snow and ice., Every variety o grains, grasses, fruits and vege, tables grown in the temperate and semi-tropic, zones can be prodnced in the valleys of Alizona., Wheat, corn barley, oats and all the small grains, give a yield-of from twenty-five to fifty bushels to, the acre. Alfalfa, clover, t\'raothy, Bermuda and, all the cultivated grasses grow luxuriantly, the, former giving from eight to tun tons to the acre, each year, Every variety of vegetable raised in, the United States can be grown in Arizona, and, nowhere are they found oetter quality., "Besides the products mentioned, these semi, tropical valleys produce cotton, sugar-cane, to, bacco, hemp and rice. With the exception of the, sugar-cane, but little attcnticu is paid to the. culti, vation of other staples; but it has been .demonstrat, ed that the soil and climate are specially adapted, to their successful growth. Cotton-growing is no, experiment in Arizona, for it is on record that, when the Europeans first penetrated this region,, they found the Pima Indians wearing fabrics, made of citton grown in the Cila valley., "But it is their adaptability for fruit culture, that assures to these valley lands a dense popula, tion and a prosperous future. Almost every var, iety known can be raised in their fruitful soils. The, apple, pear, plum, peach, apricot, quinee and nec, tarine, are of delicious flavor, and give a gen, erous yield. The grape of all varieties is a home, in these sunny vales. No place in the grape-growing, belt of the Pacific Coast can show so prolific n, yield. The quality is all that could be desired;, and the wine, although its manufacture is ret ex, perimental, is of a fine flavor, delicious bouquet,, and uns jrpaased by any native product as a table, beverage. Experiments with the raisin-grape, have shown that this climate and soil possess, every advantage for the production and curing of, this staple article-of commerce., "Besides the fruits already mentioned, the or, ange, lemon, lime, olive, fig. pomegranate, and, others of the citrus family, can be grown success, fully in the valleys of Southern Arizona. Orange, trees are now in bearing in the Salt River valley, and at Yuma; while the bananas is also being cul, tivated at the latter place, lhe Arizona orange in, quality and flavor will compare favorably with the, bcsCalifornia., "In the valleys of thcColorad?, the Salt and the, Gila rivers, there is room for thousands. It is not, teo much to say that nowhere within the limits of, this broad Union ean be found a more-desirable, region for tho making of a home. No laborious, clearing of the land is required; it lies almost, ready for the plow. Trees and shrubbery have so, rapid a growth that within elghtepn months the, immigrant can surround his abode with attractions, which would require years to maturu in. less favored, climates. Fruits ripen and are ready for market, a full month before the California product. The, bright sunshine makes life a luxury, and the pure,, dry atmosphere brings health to all who inhale it., For the establishment of colonies, such as we have, made of Southern California a arden, Arizona, presents unrivaled opportunities Thousands of, acres, now profitless, - can he made productive, by AO construction of irrigating ditches, and there, is no investment which assures larger or more, permanent returns .", . LANDS AND SOILS., The lands of Yuma County comprise tho river, bottoms and valleys and the uplands or mesas The, bottom ands are moister and slightly \'mere fertile, if, indeed, it is possible to make comparisons, where all are so wonderfully pAductive and prolific, The uplands or mesas are warmer and, perhaps,, lightly for better the cultivation of the citrus fruits, Yuma contains a variety of soil. The valley land, of the Gila and Colorado rivers have for the most, part a deep sedimentary soil of brownish, gray, sandy loam, resting, in most places, upon a gray, clay subsoil at a depth of from ten to twenty feet, below the surface, The clay subsoil forms a hard, pan which is impervious to water. These soils hare, been slowly formed by the decomposition of shales,, sandstones, marls, limestones, etc., mixed with or, ganic and vegetable matter, washed down by the, mighty rivers and have been gradually deposited, during the course of centuries. Thr fertilizing, brownish mud held in the wat not the Colorado, and Gila rivers resembles that from the Nile, and, its quantity rarics from 0.1 to 0.5 per cent.,, though the water n hen even considerably discolor, ed by mud Is good t drink, resembling in this" res, pect tho Missouri river water. A chemical analysis, of the sediments of the Colorado and of the Nile, exhibits a wonderful similarity in the constituent, parts of each. That of the Colorado exhibiting s, trifle less potassa, most phosphoric acid and car, bonade of limestomi beds through which the Colo, rado passes. In other respscts the sedim\'ont of the, Colorado is almost Identical with that ot the Nile,, It will be noticed, therefore, that when tfift water is, used for irrigation it is" superior to artesian waters, since it is constantly supplying the land with the, richest fertilizing elements. The soil of the valley, is extremely rich in dedomposed vegetable matter, and uncombmed cafon, readily absorbing the, aerial gases, such espMfally, as oxygen, which en, taring the soil, decoL.oscs the organic matters so, that they can be taken up and nourish the plants, which may De conaiuereu a leauing leatur: in it, fertility.

In its mechanical composition its, particle8 are in a state of very fine division, which, renders it more productive than coarser soils I, acquirics hBStrea\'dily! in tho daytime, and the loss, of the heat at night is very gradual, so that it re, mains always warm and is not subject to sudden, changes of heat and cold.

But there are hotels with almost a, much frontage as the Waldorf i and, like, everything else in the Territory excepting, the mountains and deseits, they are new, There are boarding houses of more kinds, than one; and brick cottages of oight or, ten rooms can occasinallv by rented. Bet, ter than any of them, for the man with, energy and the pluck to take it, is to, on the desert; and he who knows how, "camp out" with comfort through Septem, bcr in the Adirondack can camp out in, Arizona through the winter., As to food, there is plenty, and it, good if you can get it well cooked. The, alfalfa fields of the Salt River Valley are, the fattening ground for the great cattle, ranges of the Territory. From there the, markets of Los Angeles and even of Denver, are largely supplied, Good beef, mutton, and poultry aro plenty and cheap. Quail, ducks and venison from the vicinity can, also be had. Vegetables and fruits are, abundant in their season, and sometimes, the season is a long one. It is the one, country I have lived in where strawberries, ripen in the open air ten months in the, year. I have had them on my table, fresh, picked from the open garden at Christmas, ALTITUDES., It is a striking advantage offered by, Arizona that, with the same general con, ditions as to temperature and dryness of, air, the physician is able to select nearly, any altitude he may desire. Thus, asth, matic suuerers can una almost the sea, level at Ynma, or an altitude of only, thousand feet at Phoenix, or of only 2,400, at Tucson. Others, who find no objection, to greater elevations, can choose betweer, Prescott or Fort Whipple, 5,400; Flag, staff, 6,S00,; the Sulphur Spring Valley, or, Fort Grant, 4,200; Fort Huacbuca. 4,800, or Oracle, about 4,000., WHICH TOWN IS THe 3 EST?, Primarily that is a question for the phy, sician, if there is a physician in the case, if not, try them all. If a mountain region, considerable altitude and a comparatively, low temperature is desired, Prescott is in, a picturesque region, near a great mining, districts, and has the social advaxtapi of, an army post, Whipple Barracks. T \'ag-, staff is still higher, is in a region of (\' ase, pine forests, and is within p. hard r vy s, journey of one Of the wonders of the w Id, the Colorado Canyor Oracle is a p: itty, mountain nook, oowered in splendid, live oaks, like Y ,sc of California, and i, also near an ,iportant mining district, If lower altitude and a distinctly semi, tropical climate are desired, the three places, most likely to be considered are Yuma, Tucson and Phoenix. The first is near the, sea level; is the wannest and probably the, driest of the three, has the least population, and the smallest provision for visitors,, Tucson is the oldest town in tho Territory, and, after Santa Fe, perhaps the oldest; in, the Southwest. Its adobe houses give it a, Mexican look, and are thoroughly comfort, able. Its newer houses are of a handsome, building stone, found in ths vicinity. The, Territorial University is 1 ere, and it was, formerly the capital. Its elevation being, more than double that of Phoenix, it, somewhat cooler, and as there is next to no, irrigation near it, the air is a little drier,, Phoenix is the centre of the greatest\' irriga, tion in the Territory. The country for, miles around smiles with green fields, cover, ed with almost countless herds of cattle., and it is everywhere shut in by low mount, ains. It is the Territorial capital, has the, Government Indian School, the Territorial, Lunatic Asylum, and other institutions,, and is the general focus for the Territory, Like Tucson, it has its occasional wind and, sand storms perhaps not quite so often,, At either place visitors who know how to, adapt themselves to circumstances can be, entirely comfortable, and\' in each they will, find an intelligent, orderly, enterprising and, most hospitable community. They will, find a country full of mines, full of rich, agricultural lands, abounding in cattla and, horses, in vineyards and orchards and the, beginnings of very successful orange groves, .a country, in fact, as full of promise for, hardy and adventurous men now as Califor, nia was in thefifties. Above all, it has, been their lot to search for health in far, countries, they will revel in . the .luxury of, being in their own land, among their own, tcountrymen, within easy reach of their, friends by telegraph or rail\', and\' in a climate, as good of its kind as any in the world., ACTUAL HUMIDITY., This is extren ely alight, everywhere in, Arizona, as compared with any eastern, climate in the United States. The air is, driest on the high mesas, remote from, snowclad mountains or forests, and in the, desert valleys, where no considerable irri, gation has been begun., RAIN., Showers, .and indeed heavy raina ars, liablft to occur in every month of tho year, but the actual number of .rains seems to an, eastern .visitor . strangely small. -Th, average. rainfall in Southern Arizona, -as\', Hiiowii uy uiu.uruverurueus oueiy&tiona,as, but 8 inches per year., AJIIZOJTA\'S AGEICDLTDBAJt, EB(K, DUCTS., AithotigK \'thousands of .Sere? of, land are tintior cultivation in Ari-, na, the agricultural development\', the ierrltory hag only begun., nndreds of thousands 6f acres of, he most fertile soil on th nnn:, nent, in a land of perpetual sun, shine and in a climnt, . wwuu UWi 1 0, the growth of all the products of, temperate and semi-tropic tones\';, avyait only the life-giving touch of, water to convert them from desert, tracts into luxurious. gardens. .This, ear the hot sands defy the propa, gation of vegetable life; next yeif, these.same sands will feel the throb, f the irrigation vein, and where, only the desert shrubs onstgre, there will spring,np luxuriant ritie\', yards, orchards heavy with delici, ous fruits, beautiful gardens and, broad fields of grain and grassei\':, A prosperous population will find, homes in the valleys of Arizona\', rivers, attracted not only by tb.S, luxury of life in a land of eternal, sunshine, whero every breeze carries, with it a message ot health and, vigor; where the scourge? of other, localities blizzards, snow storms,, floods and cyclones are unknown,, but also by the fertile soil whose, wonderful fecundity will enabja, man to reap the fruits of his labors, within an almost incredibly short, space of time., The oil of the Aiizona valleys js, as inexhaustible as it is fertile. For, ages the streams have carried down, from the mountain districts the, detritus which forms this soil. Fre, quent inundations and shifting of, channels have caused the deposit, of the rich vegetable matters which, have made the valleys of the Terri, tory, and especially those . of th9, Salt, Gila and Colorado rivers, so, wonderfully fertile. The soil rangea, from a black, alluvial mold near, the water to a rich, -mellow, porous, loam further back from the streams., The -former is especially adapted to, to the growth of grain and grasses,, while the sandy loam fnjfills all the, conditions for successful fruit cul, ture. The growth of all products, fruits, cereals and vegetables is, rapid and prolific. Iri many in, stances two crops are" grown . in a, single year, white as many as six, crops of alfalfa have been harvested, within that peri6d., There is scarcely a Ideality oh the, gbbe that, can successfully grow.as, great a variety of. grains, grasses,, fruits end vegetables as Arizona., Wheat, oats, barley, corn and all the, smaller cereals yield enormous, crops; every variety of vegetable, known in the country is grown in, Arizona, and every variety readier, the acme of perfection. Alfalfa, clover, timothy, Ka&r corn, millst, and all the grasses have luxuriant, growth; cotton, sugar-cane, sugar, beets, hemp, rice and tobacco thrive, in the soil, while there h scarcely, a fruit under the sun apples, pears,, plums, peaches, apricots, quinces,, nectarines, dates, grapes, oranges, lemons, figs, limes olive?, pome, granates and others of the citrus\', genus, all of delicious flavor ", that cannot be raised in the rich, sandy loam. Fruits ripen a month, earlier in th:e Territ6ry than in\', California, and in consequence of, their being placed oh the early, market bring a better price than\', the fruit products" of the coast., The prolific and rapid growth.of, vegetation is a remarkable feature, ot Arizona s\'oil. A Cottonwood\', saplin g becomes a Shade tree twenty, five feet high within two years;, grape cuttings oiten produce withir, eighteen to twenty months; the, farmer plants\' ra Noveniber and by, May his crop is ready to be harvest, ed. Alfalfa yields from eight to\', ten tons\' per acre each year, and the\', cereals from twenty-five to fifty, bushels per acre., A review of the agricultural con -, ditions that prevail in Arizona, shows that the future df the Terri, tory depends not upon hdf mining, industries alone, nor on fcr timber, nor her herds and flocks of stock:, but in later years it will be found\', that the era of social arid intellec, tual development-which she is even, now entering upon has Seen found, ed mainly 6n her great agricultural1, resources., Both ericrev and cam\'tal will ha, required tobrins aDoutthiadfilon., mentr but thg former is ar charac, teristic of Arizona\'s nonulation., while the latter is dailr seeking, investment within our " limits.-, Ar\'zona Graphic]']</pre>
