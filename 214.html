C., as especially stifling to, Alaska? Bureaucracy has been the, curse of Alaska, and the Department, of the Interior has been one of the, chief factors in this curse. Mr. Lane, has known for years that bureaucracy, was damming to Alaska, yet it re, mained for him to show up this gov, ernmental fallacy at the last minute, ©f the eleventh hour. It can only be, hoped that Mr. Lane’s parting shot, will have some good effect.—Seward, Gateway., Charles Cameron, proprietor of, Cameron’s cafe, in Seward, is carrying, an advertisement in the Anchorage, papers in an endeavor to secure a, share of the trade from that city. The, plan is not new Outside, but is a nov, elty in Alaska, where to be a resident, ©f one town is to incur the enmity of, the citizens of neighboring towns. It, has often been a matter of curiosity, with the Miner as to why business, hostelries to the westward did not go, after the traveleers from the time they, struck Cordova or Valdez. Many firms, send cards over by friends and dis, tribute them to passengers on the, boats, but this means of advertising, is not nearly so effective as news, paper advertising.

HARWOOD, Prop., —— I, Concrete Hut in Place of Igloo Will, Hasten Extinction of Eskimos., By VILHJALMUR STEFANSSON, Arctic Explorer., The movement to modernize the Eskimo bv providing him with con, crete huts in place of his picturesque snow “igloos,” as suggested by an, official of the United States bureau of fisheries, would be the death of the, • denizen of the icy north. Not only is the Eskimo devoted to bis age-long, habitation as the South Sea islanders are to their traditional garb of flower, garlands and fresh smiles, but he is far healthier, warmer and more com, fortable in his domed mansion of snow than he could be in any modern, house of concrete., Their igloo serves as a home for two or three weeks. Then they build, a new one. Because it is new it is clean and sanitary. Tt is as warm and, comfortable as your library, The concrete hut, like the wooden hut, must be uncomfortable and, unsanitary. Whenever the natives have changed from the snow to the, wooden home there has followed pneumonia and typhoid and a tremendous, increase in the death rate., The Eskimos are a migratory race. Contact with civilization has af, fected them and they are dying off. They must soon be extinct, and the, concrete hut hastens that extinction., £ $•, CORDOVA JAZZ ORCHESTRA I, £ £, ! ■ DANCE I, $: $:, •X, .V, SATURDAY NIGHT, ♦ • ••, |v .y, 8 *;, *x, V. — .*.•, .... ■--- “ X, x:, £ £, • • *%•, y., :-j: The Cordova Jazz Orchestra will give away to its lady pa- •:*:, :j:j trons durin gthe months of January, February and March $50 in $:, ;X, ;X gold in three prizes to the ladies guessing the amount of beans, .v y., X; in a glass jar.

The question at issue, is not whether prohibition is or is, not desirable. That was a question, on which men might honestly differ, before prohibition became a law of, the land and part of the federal con, stitution.

To that, question there can be but one answer., Whether a man believes in prohibition, not he must comply with the law, *id aid in its enforcement or be a, lawless citizen. As the Anti-Saloon, Laague sees it, two important things, are involved in the coming nomina, tions and elections: firstly, that the, chief executive of this nation, who is, the chief law enforcement official,, must be a man wholly committed to, the enforcement policy; and. second,, that a Congress must be elected that, will take no backward step in prohi, bition legislation.’’, TOURIST HOTEL BURNS, AT VIRGINIA RESORT, OLD POINT COMFORT.

And, if that is the case, the service very, likely will not be resumed unless, more satisfactory arrangements can, be made for handling the business, between Fairbanks and Chitina or, until the business can be routed by, way of the Broad Pass route., The company might have been in, duced to divert its business to the, Broad Pass trail this winter but for, the fact that there was no certainty, that the Government railhoad between, reward and Anchorage could be kept, open. With this uncertainty now re, moved and the assurance that the, ends of steel will be brought much, closer together before the end of, another working season, there is, reason to believe that satisfactory, arrangements can be made for car, rying express across Broad Pass, during the coining winter and there, after until such time as the business, can be taken care of altogether by, the Government railroad. It has been, demonstrated that much more satis, factory results might have been ob, tained this winter by the company, had the Nenana-Broad Pass route, been used instead of the much longer, Richardson trail, with its unreliabie, mail service., There is a movement already on, foot in Nenana to take the matter, up with the company with a view to, the establishment of an express, route via Broad Pass during the, coming winter, and the matter doubt, less will receive the attention of the, Commercial club at an early date., Those who have interested them, selves in the matter argue that it is, not a case of trying to get the busi, ness away from Fairbanks, but is, merely to revive the service which, has been discontinued, prpesumably, because of the inability of the Fair, banks-Chitina contractors to make, good. As it stands now, the Interior, country has no express service of, any sort, and probably will not have, until Wells Fargo& Co. can be in, duced to use the Broad Pass tray.—, Nenana News., LUTHER C.

Barrett, President of the Mc, Carthy Commercial Club, who is a, Cordova visitor. “This aid could be, extended to prospectors as a credit;, the Government to have a lien or, some chance for an action against, every prospector to whom this credit, was extended to, for all time to come,, until such bills should have been, paid. Said bonafide prospector, should be allowed more credit should, he fail to discover anything the first, year, and as long as he is trying to, make good, the longer he stays out, prospecting, the more ambitious he, becomes and his knowledge in, creases., a Donus snouia De anowea accora, ing to the extent or size of the camp, developed, as the result of the dis, covery made by any one of the pros, pectors said bonus could be paid by, a tax of a small amount levied, against the output of every operatoi, in said camp, allowing a certain ex, emption. Thus making the richei, claims which could stand it pay saic;, bonus., This would be an inducement, to the prospector who might be the, lucky one to discover a great camp, by making the discovery on whal, turned out to be a low grade claim, as did Pedro when he discovered, Fairbanks. Pedro made the discovery, in a low grade section of this great, camp., “On many creeks in Alaska ,and, the Klondike, the discovery claims, were not the best, but to those pros, pectors belong the credit for the dis, covery of the great camps of the, oast. The opportunities are just as, good today as they ever were for new, discoveries of great camps. Alaska, is hardly scratched yet. Capital has, always followed the prospector. Wit!, plenty of prospectors in the hills ol, Alaska and some Government aid, towards trails and wragon roads w\'e, will find the needed capital knock, ing at our door.”, Congoleum Rugs, suitable for every, room in your house, can be found at, the Northwestern Hardware Co., Scarborough Pictures that please at|, prices that are right Over Cordova, drug store.
