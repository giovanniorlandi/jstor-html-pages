SI.OO., \'su/VERTdiTrn LEAdTSTST, EDITORIAL COMMENT., I’ t much interest is expressed, ill Washington in the revival of, Germany’s implied threat to open, a general tariff war against this, country, for the very Bimple reason, war is a two-sided game and that, the United States would have a, decided advantage in such a war., Although Germany purchases, quite largely from this country, it, needs our patronage much more, than we need hers., The success of the Fusion ticket, in Colorado is not going to work, very much good for the state. The, entire commonwealth will he called, Upon to play a part in Denver’s, corrupt politics and there will be, no responsibility for the evils that, may be committed, the legislature, will be as extravagant and incom, petent as before and without any, more responsibility. Its time will, be occupied in the selection of a, United States senator and secur, ing all the boodle possible and, very little attention will be paid, the welfare of the state at large., The census reports just made, public show 1 a gratifying increase, cities of the stute. There, cPv now twenty-seven cities and, t >wns in Colorado with a popula, tion of more thnn 2,000, ranging, from Denver with 133,859 to Rocky, Ford with 2,018. Five of those on, the list were not in existence ten, years ago: Cripple Creek, \\ ietor,, Florence, Globeviile and Goldfield,, and no comparison can bo made, with the former census. Of the, others show an actual decrease:, Trinidad, 3.2 per cenl., Aspen,, 54.9 per cent., Ouray, 12.3 per, cent, and Golden £,9.8 per cent., According to the census of this, year, Crested Butte has a popula, tion of 988., Persons who imagine that the, history of Wall Street is solely, chronicled in the financial columns, of the daily press make a very ser, ious mistake. Regarded as an in, stitution, Wall Street creates and, executes schemes of gigantic pro, portions, which, in their ultimate, development, hardly hear a single, ’ tag of the money market. • Wall, Street, too, has opinions on all, national and international ques, tions, opinions that are neither po -, fiscal, diplomatic, sociological, not, economic, but which combine, all four elements in an ideal pro, portion. Thus it is that no one, who desires to have a broad and, thoroughly comprehensive idea of, the great questions of recent days, can afford to ignore tho opinion of, Wall Street., The Taylor Park Mining com, pany, in this county, built a ditch, lfi miles long, and to protect its, rights to the ground, located a, placer claim sixteen miles long and, fifty-two feet wide, containing, nearly 102 acres. A part of this, placer crossed surveyed legal sub, divisions, and in defiance of the, statute that placers must conform, to legal subdivisions, the small, strip above mentioned was only, taken. The Secretary of the In, terior, in approving the land office, decision,, says: “It is clear that, congress never contemplated the, location and patenting of any such, placer claim ns the one involved iu, this case. A placer claim 16 miles, long and about 51 feet wide is be, yond all bounds of reason, and the, \'entry, therefore, cannot be 6us, rflincd -—Marble Times,, CRESTED BUTTE, GUNNISON COUNTY, COLORADO, NOVEMBER 13, i960., FIRST FRUITS OF REPUBLICAN, SUCCESS., The following morning after the, election the stock exchanges in, this country and in Europe showed, unusual animation and a substan, tial appreciation in securities due, to Republican success in the na- j, tional campaign. Not alone his j, own people, but those of other na- j, tions accepted the re-election of, William McKinley as n guarantee, of peace abroad and confidence at!, home., The outside world have come to \', recognize that the McKinley ad, ministration stands for conserva, tism and rare judicial acumen. Its, able conduct of the Spanish war j, and later its eminent ability in j, dealing with complex Chinese af- j, fair have forced the civilized world j, to admit the strength of this re, public and its efficacy in diplomacy., In the Chinese matter unwilling, tribute was exacted from the, enemy in the position taken by, this country, a position that fore, stalled much bloodshed., In domestic affairs President, McKinley has the entire confidence j, of the people. Even his political, enemies rely implicitly upon his, judgment in whatever he under, takes, knowing that plain, shrewd, American sense, and not a desire, for pyrotechnicnl displays, is his, guide. Therefore it is not at all, surprising that securities of all, kinds took an upward trend os, soon as his re-election was as-,, sured., In less than four years in which, this country has been guided l)3’, McKinley, the nation has taken, wonderful leaps in trade affaire., It is today tho greatest power in, world economics; it has increased, its own trade at home to the exclu, sion of importers, and has become, the greatest factor in the markets, of the world. Within the last few, years the manufacturers of this, country have taken possession of, important enterprises every, where and New York has super, seded London as the financial, center of the world., The policy to be pursued by the, President during the next four, years will be such ns to secure the, approval of the majority. As Mr., McKinley does not believe himself, to be infallible, there may be, some concessions. There is work, to be done at home and abroad and, victory will not interfere with the, habit Mr. McKinley has practiced, of feeling the pulse of public sen, timent., Many theories aro advanced by, both sides as to the cause of the, Republican triumph. One very, plausible one was offered by a, business man with large interests, who takes no part whatever in, politics. He said: “I have at, several times in my life had man, agers whose methods I did not like,, in some instances, but who pro, duced such good results that I, raised their salaries instead of get, ting rid of them. Tho President, is the manager of- that big busi, ness known ns the United States, government, of which the people, are proprietors. Many of his, methods have been displeasing to, a great many people, but the re, sults he has produced- the gene, ral and unprecedented prosperity, of the country—caused a majority, of the owners of the business he, manages to vote to let well enough, alone and continue him as man, ager for another term of four, years.”, In 1890 McKinley received only, 151 votes in Cxufinison county., This year he received a total of, 88(3. The change here cannot but, be gratifying to our home Repub, lic a us., Gold Hunters of the Americas., No doubt, when Columbus was, pleading at the Court of Spain for, a fleet with which to find a shorter, route to India, he little dreamed of, the great laud that awaited his, coming on tho other side of the, Atlantic. Rut af\' r he had re, turned, and it was proven that a, ship could sale for wtvks on prac, tically the same course Vrithout, tumbling into space, other marin- j, era did not hesitate to undertake, the voyage., Consequently, in the year 1512,, Ponce Do Leon set out iu search, of his fabled ‘Fountain of Youth.”, That he returned to Spain "A, sadder hut wiser man,” to die,, crowned only by his locks of sil, vered hair, are facta we glean from, history., In 1517 Cordova discovered Mex, ico, bringing home news of the, wonderful cities he had seen; of, their wealth of gold and silver,, with what information he could, obtain as to the defenseless condi, tion of the inhabitants., Adventurers, buccaneers and pi, rates were now scurrying across, the ocean, all determined on plun, dering the new forind land of its, wealth, o‘. which the returning, voyagers had given such glowing, accounts., Cortez sailed with an expedition, often vessels and six hundred men, from Spain in 1519, for the con, quest of Mexico. Two years later, witnessed the overthrow of the, Montezuma., Then followed the slaughter of, the Mexican rulers n:id thousands, of the people; the looting of the, ancient capital of the Aztecs, while, fire and vword hr.»k • down p. Better, civilization than the Spanish ever, built elsewhere than in Spain., Ten years later Fizarro, a Span, ish adventurer, with a band of, reckless cavaliers, Waged .war on, the Incas of Peru, which was at, that time a great empire. Cuzco, was the scat of government, situ, ated on the remote headwaters of!, the Amazon, 11.300 feet above seat, level. It was a grand and mag- 1, nificent city of churches, palaces, and temples. The latter included, the famous Temple of the Sun,, richly adorned with gold and sil, ver ornaments., But the free-booltTs won, the day, and thus perished, another race of people, whoso his, tory would today be worth more, than all the gold secured by the, Spaniards at their downfall. Here, it in that we get the old legend of, the golden chain, weighing thou, sands of pounds, which was thrown, into the lake when tho people, despaired of repulsing their assail, ants., De Soto in 101 l landed in Flor, ida and commenced the search for, gold iu North America. Ho trav, ersed over a greater part of the, Mississippi Valley in search of, precious niHrds, and his treatment, of the Indians, in his efforts to, compel them to tell where they, obtained the few gold orntiinents, they wore, defies description. He, discovered the Mississippi river in, 1542, and died near its mouth. At, midnight his disheartened follow, ers sunk his body in the sullen, waters of the great river., Thus ended, devoid the results,, De Soto’s expedition, whoso great, est achievement, it has been said,, “was the discovery of his burial, place.”, From De Soto’s time the har, vests of the Gold Hunters de, creased until We find that coloniza, tion for agricultural and pastoral, ! purposes, were the uppermost ideas, in tho minds of the Europeans,, in regard to the New World.

Nov. 7.—lt became evident at an early hour last evening, that the election of McKinley and Roosevelt was assured., At half past eight o’clock returns from nearly two-thirds of the elec, tion districts of Greater New York had been received, indicating that, Bryan and Stevenson could not expect more than 25,000 or 110.000 plurality, in this Democratic stronghold, and unless there was a landslide in the out, side counties beyond all reasonable expectation, the pivotal state of New, York hod declared in unmistakable terms, although by a greatly reduced, majority, for the Republican candidates., As the niglit progressed it only served to confirm this judgment. The, returns from Illinois revealed a like condition. The Republican plurality, of 1800 was greatly reduced, but it was still too large to be overcome., On the other hand, the returns from Indiana, Michigan, the two Da, kotas. Utah and Wyoming as well as Nebraska seemed to indicate strong, Republican gains over 1806. Delaware. Maryland and West Virginln had, given decided Republican pluralities. The count in several of the Western, states was naturally so delayed ns to give little Indication of the opinion, there, but they bad censed to have a determining effect, and before 10, o\'clock the Democratic lenders had given up the contest, and it was an, nounced that Mr. Bryan had gone to bed and was sound asleep., The whole story was easily and brietly told. The Republican ticket, would have a larger electoral vote than four years ago, but In the larger, states of the East and middle West the pluralities of ’9O had been greatly, reduced., Massachusetts had fallen from 174,000 to 80,000; New York from 208,-, 000 to 135,000. and Illinois from 142,000 to 00,000 or less., The roll of states is apparently as follows;, FOR MCKINLEY., California 0 North Dakota 3, Connecticut 6 Oregon 4, Delaware 3 Ohio 23, Illinois 24 Pennsylvania 32, Indiana 15 Rhode Island 4, lowa 13 South Dakota 4, Kansas lO Utah 3, Maine (I Vermont 4, Maryland S Washington 4, Massachusetts 15 West Virginia 0, Michigan 14 Wisconsin 12, Minnesota 9 Wyoming 3, New Hampshire 4, New Jersey 10 Total 284, New York 30, FOR BRYAN., Alabama ll Nevada 3, Arkansas 8 North Carolina 11, Colorado 4 South Carolina 9, Florida 4 Tennessee 12, Georgia 13 Texas 15, Louisiana 8 Virginia 12, Mississippi 9, Missouri 17 Total 139, Montana 3, DOUBTFUL., Idaho 3 Nebraska 8, Kentucky 13, Total 24, If all tho unreported states should turn out ns Democratic, a highly, improbable contingency, it would not change the result.

The Republican says:, The majority for William Jennings, Bryan in this state will reach .*IO,OOO, in all probability. The majority for, James B.

There would, in such an event Ik* two Teller!tin and, two Populists., As to the Legislature the Republicans, will not give out any figures. The Dem, ocratic state committee and the chair, man of the Tellurite party claim that, the Republicans will have less than a, dozen members of the Legislature, not, «*ouuting the one hold-over. Senator, Meyer. Conservative estimates allow, the Republicans just a dozen of the leg, islators elected last Tuesday, although, more are claimed by them. One ltopu, iican senator, M. /. Farwell, is said to, have won in the Twenty-third district,, which is com|M)sed of Otero.

Martin and, Harry Hunt. but. although they lost, the senator iu this county, the Repub, licans do not consider these claims se, riously., It seems very likely now that in the, Thirteenth General Assembly there, will be just thirteen administration Re, publicans. This combination of thir, teen may be considered an omen or, not.

Indeed, in spite of Cap, tain Smith’s protests, boat loads of, rand, containing shining particles, |of mica, which was mistaken for, gold, was sent to England. His-, I tory fails to tell us what became of, | those worthless cargoes., The growth and development of, the country from 1607 to 18*18,, when gold was discovered in Cali, fornia. is history with which every, schoolboy is familiar. The latter, discovery verified the opinion of, the buccaneer, Sir Francis Drake,, who on his return (1578) from the, Pacific coast, reported that he was, convinced that there was “no part, :of the country wherein then*, I not some special likelihood of, | gold.” Immediately, upon the ’, | news reaching the Atlantic States,, n mighty immigration commenced,!, | not only from the United States,, but all the free outlaws, highway, men ami gamblers from the whole, world, tlocked to the new Eldo, rado. Then followed the commis, sion of terrible crimes, while gam, bling and wild speculation was, the order of the day. The histor, ical Vigilance committee was then, formed, which soon rid the coun, try of, dr silenced, the lawless cle, ment. The fabulous wealth ac, quired in a short time, by the more, fortunate, was an incentive that, produced hundreds of Gold Hunt, ers, or Prospectors, ns they have, been termed ever since. As the, excitement gradually subsided, at, tention was turned to the Rocky, Mountain region; and from that, time the Prospector has been the, factor of the development of a, great country., What a contrast there is be, tween the armor clad Gold Hunter, of the fifteenth century, and the, quiet practical Prospector of today., The former seeking only gold that, could be acquired by force of arms;, and with an army of daring follow, ers, flourish of trumpets and clash, of steel, he stalked through tho, forests, a terror, alike to the na, tives, and settlers from other coun, tries than his own. The latter,, with his pack animals, armed only, with pick nnd shovel—a peaceful, conquest against the forces of na, ture— plods his weary way across, the treeless pram, and over the, snow-capped mountains, in search, of the yellow metal, the possession, of which has been the ambition of, men in all ages and climes. It is, to tho Prospector that we owe the, discovery of great veins of mineral, which has brought many millions, of dollars into circulation, during, the last decades of the closing cen, tury; while around him clusters, song and story of the wild and ro, mantic life he leads. We know of, no fascination to be compared with, that of prospecting, unless it be, that of gnmbling. Lured on by a, never-dying hope that he may, some day “strike it rich,” he, spends years of his life amid wild, and rugged scenes,only to spend the, fortune acquired in further search, for another, and, as is frequently, the case, to die a poor man., E.

Mr. \\\\\\ 13., Long, of this city,, called my attention \' f* \' 1, to Acker\'s English ll fL-’<, Remedy for Throat l’h, and Lung Trou, bles. I thought lit- fejaN-Sy J /, tie of it hut bought ffiKraw\'-\'vO, a bottle in the hopes, that it might help, me a lit tle. It gave W fl\\ \\, me wonderful re- y I \\ I v,, lief, and the second / I \\ I, bottle cured me V I jl |, completely. My re- i. ■ *, covery is permanent, too, for ever since I, have not had the slightest return of my old, enemy. I consider Acker’s English Remedy, by Ion" odds the best medicine in tho world, for hacking coughs, asthma and bronchitis., It completely masters those stubborn dis, eases that many people wrongly suppose to, he incurable. If sufferers will just try a sin, gle bottle, it will prove every word I have, said, and more too.” (Signed.), John D.
