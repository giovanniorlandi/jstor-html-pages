Porter, of Winona, Miss.,\nto The Southern Ruralist will be Inter\nesting to truck gardeners.\n\'\'I have an acre in garden on a\nsouthern slope to south of house and\nwell drained. The soil has yellow clay\nsubsoil and was considered about worn\nout four years ago. Last year we sold\n$400 worth of vegetables from it, my\nhusband going twice a week four\nmiles to market with them and other\nfarm products.\n"We had abundance of fresh vege\ntables for our family of seven the\nwhole year; I canned four hundred\ncans of tomatoes, beans, and okra. We\nspent $27 for fertilizer, plants, seed\nand a little labor. In addition we used\ntwenty loads of manure from our cow\nbarn, all the hardwood ashes we made\nand manure from weekly cleanings of\npoultry houses, and all other refuse\nfrom about the yard. I am keeping an\naccount of every hour either of us\nspend working garden this year.\n"The pleasure of watching the little\nplants grow, and seeing the red ground\ngetting blacker together with the\nhealthful exercise, cannot he esti\nmated in dollars and cents.\n"It is hard to say when the garden\ning season begins in this section, as\nwe are continually planting and sell\ning. We raise truck for the home\nmarket only.\n"As soon as the ground is dry\nenough, after frost kills the fail beans\nand tomatoes, the ground is plowed\nopen, barnyard manure applied in fur\nrows, a long shovel run as deep as\npossible in center of furrow and on\neach side, thoroughly mixing manure\nwith soil; the ground is then bedded\non this.\n"The first favorable weather in Jan\nuary I knocked off top of rows, run a\nfurrow with hand plow and set cab\nbage plants in this open furrow, which\nprotects alike from cold and the heat\nof sun. Last spring a large percent\nage of my cabbage was headed hard\nby April 21. T also plant and set beets\nin open furrow in January, and treat\nvery much as cabbage.\n"I have a corner in the garden made\nin a well drained bed containing about\ni\nthree hundred and fifty square fe*t! ,\nthat I plant In onions as early in the |\nfall as can get rain, tho falls here\nusually being hot and dry. I cultivate\nthese entirely with wheel hoes and\ncultivators, t plant the small quan\ntity of lettuce needed In a bed tn\nprotected sections along fence, setting\nsome between early cabbage for head\ning.\n"I plant garden peas from January\nuntil March,\nbeans, both dwarf and pole, as soon\nas ground is warm enough for seeds\nto germinate; also okra, cucumbers,\nsquash and other vegetables.\n"As soon as the ground Is cleared\nof early cabbage It is prepared for\nfall beans without other fertilizing.\nThe onion bed being planted some\nwhat earlier gives midsummer beans.\n"The early bean and pea rows are\nprepared for winter cabbage. I begin\nplanting these early in .Ttily and on\ntinue until middle of August. Beets\nplanted in August or September are\nfairly successful; tomatoes may be\nplanted as late as June 15."\nPlant beans, butter\nNEW COMMANDER FOR\nTHE FRENCH ARMY.\nPARIS, August 5—General Charles\nLouis Tremean. has been appointed\ncommander-in-chief of the French\narmy In succession to General De Lo\nCroix.\n.*ve;"\n4.\nCAN\'T RELEASE\nFATHERHOLTGRAVE\nDistrict Attorney Says Priest Will\nHave to Remain in Jail Till Sent for\nby Iberville Authorities.\nNEW ORLEANS, August 5.—In re\nsponse to a request made on District\nAttorney Adams that he ameliorate the\nconfinement of Father Holtgreve at\nthe First Precinct Station, the dis\ntrict attorney announced that he\ndistrict attorney had no authority in\nthe premises and was not concerned.\nThe arrest, the district attorney an\nnounced, is one involving a fugitive\nwho is held by the police of the par\nish on instructions by wire from the\nsheriff of another parish.\nMr. Adams made this announcement\nin response to a call from an attorney\nof this city who appeared as a rrrend\nof Holtgreve.\nThe same position was taken by\nInspector of Police O\'Connor when\nthat official was approached by\nfriends of the fugitive priest today.\nThe inspector informed the callers\nthat he had no authority or no right\nto ameliorate or show any liberties not\nallowed other fugitives under the cir\ncumstances. The arrest, he said, was\nmade on an order by telegraph from\nSheriff Brown, just the same as Sher\niff Brown would he compelled by his\noath of office to apprehend and hold\nin confinement a fugitive for the po\nlice or grand jury of Orleans par\nish.\nas\nimprisonment\nwill at best not be of long duration,\nas officers are expected from Plaque- |\nmine on the evening train.

A Spanish commissary con\nvoy was attacked and driven back by j\nthe Moors. Reinforcements soon came j\nup, however, and the fight was renew-,\ned, this time with the Spaniards vie\nThe general uprisings and\nheavy enlistments on the part of the\nMoors was regarded as surprising un\ntil it was learned that the riffs are\ntorious.\npreaching a holy war against Spain.\ni They are reviving the old legend ac\nof\nof\ncording to which the Riff Arabs who\n, ire dire ct descendants of the..vf\n|\noors\ndriven out of Spain by Isabella Had\nFerdinand are destined to clear the\nSpaniard out of Africa, cross over to\nSpain and reconquer the country over\nwhich Boabail, the last king of Gre\nnada ruled.

A few of the\nsmaller roads were raised from the\nthird to the second class, increasing\ntheir privileges from $10 to $116.87%\nper mile.\nThe privilege taxes of railroads is\nfixed by the legislature, and Is not\nsubject to change by the commission.\nThe latter body, however, has tho\npower of fixing the classification, and\nthe effect Is the sa :io in the end, ex\ncept that there is no medium ground\nand they must be raised all the way\nor none.\nFirst class railroads already pay\nfrom $300 to $400 per mile in ad val\nlorem taxes, and while the addition of\na few dollars per mile will not look\nbig in the figures of any one county,\nthe increased revenue in the state will\nbe considerable, the ad valorem as\nsessment having been increased at\nthe last meeting of the commission\nabout $2,500,000, which will yield an\nadditional state tax of $150,000, with\nabout an equal amount for the vari\nout counties and proportionate amount\nfor each municipality through which\nthe railroads run.\nSTRIKKE ASSUMES\n.ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS\n^STOCKHOLM, Sw on, August 5.—\nConfTitions havt ■ imed a grave\ncrisis throughout Sweden.

Wilson, one of the signers\nof the Declaration of Independence,\nwhich has been searched for by the\nUnited States government without re\nward, has just been found by his two\ngrandsons, P. R.

Ala "\nSome time ag0 the government ap\npropnated a sum of money for the\npurpose of erecting a handsome mon\nument over the grave of Colonel Wil\nson, but the monument up to this time\nhas never been erected from the fact\nthat all trace of the grave had been\nlost and no one was able to find it. A\nfew days ago the two Hutson brothers\nwent to Kentucky to visit the old home\n| and the scenes of their childhood\ndays. On the banks of the Ohio river\nin Livingston county, Kentucky, bo\nneath the shadows of a mighty pop\n| lar tree, they found a grave which\n| they found a grave which they are\n(confident is that of their grandfather,\ni Colonel James C.

A. Knapp, i\n-literal agent in charge of ail field\nwork in the south, the Mississippi 1 !\ni.ts of the l nited States depart\nincut of agriculture, bureau of plant\nare earnestly advising the\nfarmers of the state to harrow their j\nA I\nindustry,\ncotton bclore crops are laid by.\n• ircular letter is being sent out. to all\n.a.liters who adopted the cultural\nin tliod of cotton growing and it is us\nfollows:\n"On account of the extremely heavy\nrains and the lateness of the cotton\ncrop it is very important that the\ncultivation and harowing of cotton\nextend through the month of August,\nfor by this method you will be able to\nhasten the growing and maturing of\nthe crop.\n"While it is neither advisable or\nnecessary to plow the land, it Is nc\nessary that you cultivate and harrow\nshallow at least every ten days\nthrough August to prevent the ground\nfrom getting hard or cracking open in\nevent of dry wether, and if wet, to\nprevent a crust from forming.\n"The heavy rains have made the\nground hard and cloddy, and tied the\nthe plant food that is necessary for\nthe cotton plant.\n"When the cotton gets too large for\nthe cultivator then harrow the middle\nof the row so as to retain sufficient\nmoisture, thereby having a better\nshow for a crop. The price of your cot\nton crop promises to be 12 cents per\npound or better this fall.

E. Graham,\none of the most progressive and sub\nstantial farmers in this section, who\nresides at Eatonville, called at the\nNews offive and exhibited a dozen or\nmore specimens of small bugs which\nhe confidently believed to be Mex\nican boll weevils, and stated that his\nfather, who had just returned from\nTexas and had examined the insects\nthere, was of the same opinion. Tho\nbugs were exhibited generally about\nthe city and much uneasiness was felt\nas a result.\nWhen Mr. Graham called at the\nNews office, he was advised to send\nsome of the insects to the Agricul\ntural College at Starkville for exam\nination. and acting upon this sugges\ntion the First-National Bank of Com\nmerce, through Mr. Foote, immediate\nly dispatched a specimen to Mr. R.\nW. Harned, the entomologist there,\nwith the request to wire his opinion\nas soon as the examination had been\nmade. The answer was received to\nday and conveyed the information\nthat the bugs were just the ordinary\ncommon cow pea pod weevil.\nSo manj- false and misleading re\nports of the appearance of the boil\nweevil in various sections of the state\nhave been sent out recently that the\nfarmers have nearly all become\ninterested in the matter that every\nbug which is found on the cotton plant\nis mistaken for the boll weevil, and\nfor this reason the News preferred to\nkeep quiet about Mr. Graham\'s dis\ncovery until it was in position to make\na reliable statement on the subject.\nThe boll weevil does not bore the\nso\n| boll after it has matured, as Is com\nI nonly supposed by those not familiar\ni wi,h the insect - it merely deposits Us\neggs in the square and saps its vi- .\ntality nefore the boll is matured, caus\n1 !\ning i; to drop off. the insects hatching\naft\' r the square has fallen.\nNews does not think there is any\nnecessity for alarm in this county, for\nj if the boll weevil should appear\nI H\nT\nnow,\nill he too late in the season for\nit to accomplish much harm, as the\nboll is already formed and it is only\nthe square which the insect attacks.\nODD FELLOWS INSTALL CANTON.\nMississippi Canton No. 1, Patri\narchs Militant, the highest degree of\nOdd Fellowship, has been duly in\nstalled in Hattiesburg and its organ\nization completed last night, with the\nfollowing officers:\nL. M. Williams, captain commander;\nW. J. Force, lieutenant; I. W. Sexton,\nensign; H. KaKtz, clerk, and Otis\nSmith, accountant.\nThe new branch of the order h 3 P\nabout twenty-five members, and the\nmen in their new\nuniforms with\nswords and gauntlets attracted a great\ndeal of attention on the streets last\nnight.\nHattiesburg now has the only lodge\nof this degree in the state, and has\nalso the largest lodge of Odd Fellows,\nand possibly the largest encampment.\nIt is understood that the Jackson\ncamp has for some time been figur\ning on installing a Canton there, but\nthe untiring energy of the Hatieaburg\nlodge was rewarded by the securing .I\nthe title of "Mississippi No. 1," a dis\ntinction well worthy to be proud of.\n\'\n• •', '.

Commission t j\nScott angrily asked if Hattiesburg hud j\nnot recently been before the Interstate !\nCommerce Commission, asking for j\nlower freight rates and wanted to\nknow why they were up there on this\noccasion. The answer was simple i. id\nlogical. It proved that Hattiesburg\nbusiness men could recognize the dif\n-ference between the injustice done to\nHattiesburg atid the injustice that tne\nCommission might do by a revolution\nary change In rates. It also exempli\nfied the fact that the injustice on the\npart of the railways in discriminat\nive against Hattiesburg, did not en\ngender a mean spirit on the part of\nHattiesburg business men. and they\nwere willing to protest against what\nIt.\nhe\nF.\nthe\nthe\ni\nI\n/if\nof\nally,\nand\nthey believed te be wrong.\nCommissioner Scott was told that It Send\n-was a pleasure to answer that ques\ntion in the presence of so many rail\nway men, who were representatives of\nlines which were depriving Hatties\nburg of the rights, to which she was\nentitled because of her commercial\nimportance aud geographical location\nand that Hattiesburg knew to her sor\nrow that the very men she was asking\njustice for. had not rendered justice\nto Hattiesburg, but that did not deter\nthe gentlemen who were there from\nHattiesburg from asking the Commis\nsion to carefully consider this revi\nsion of rates which it proposed, lest\nit deprive those cities of rights to\nwhich they were recognized as beuig\nentitled to because of their location.\nHattiesburg know-s that it is being\nunjustly discriminated against by the\nvery railways the Commercial Club\nhad asked justice for and was asking\nit again, Hattiesburg also knows that\nthe justice of her cause was such that\nthis discrimination must be wiped out,\nOur business men have built a city\nhere in spite of that discrimination\nand they are not going to cease in\ntheir efforts to secure the same rates\nthat are given to other cities in the\nstate of like importance. The fact\nthat the Interstate Commerce Commis\nsion did not see fit to compel the\nroads to grant to us thrt which they\nhave given to others, does not mean\nthat we*may not find and use other\nmeans to compel justice but it would\nbe much easier if the railways were\nto recognize the spirit in which Hat\ntiesburg deals with them when they\nask for help, and in return give us\nthe rates which, though it might de\nprive them of a little revenue, would\nbe more than made up by the develop\nment of the territory surrounding this\ncity. They should also remember that\nif Hattiesburg has had any influence\nin bringing the commission to a reali\nzation that the two cent rate would\nhave deprived the railways of thou\nsands of dollars in needed revenue,\nthen in the very nature of things t-ey\ncan afford to make some concessions\nto Hattiesburg.\nTo both the Railway Commission\nand the railways we can say that we\nhave not\nrights. We are going to keep up the\nfight until we win.\nturned down one day but we will go\nback the next. That is the spirit that\nhas made Hattiesburg one of the most\nprogressive cities in the state. It is\nthat spirit that has built a city where\nthe wise ones said nobody could pros\nper.
