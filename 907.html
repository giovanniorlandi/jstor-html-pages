Clinton Summers, of\nthe Anderson legislative delegation:\nGentlemen:\nI see in the press of February 3 a\nletter from you to Senator John L.\nlcLaurin, withdrawing your endorse\nment of him as a candidate for gov\nernor, you alleging as your reason\nthat he has deserted the principles of\nthe Reform party of this state. This\nletter of yours is evidently intended\nas a reply to his open letter of some\n. ;s before.\nYru accuse him of being a traitor\nto the principles of the Reform party\nof this state, yet in his letter he de\nclares he is anxious to perfect the\nwarehouse system, whereby the mid\ndie man would be eliminated and the\nCotton producer and the cotton con\nsumer would deal directly with each\nother, at a minimum of cost. Do you\nnot believe that this system would an\nnually saev to the cotton planters\nmillions of dollars ? If you (1o not be\nlieve this, why have you advocated\nit? McLaurin evidently is sincere in\nhis advocacy. Were you simply play\ning politics and hoping by advocating\nthe warehouse system, to tie to your\nchariot wheel one of the profoundest\nthinkers and most eloquent debaters\nnot only of this state, but of the na\ntion?\nDo you think our insurance laws\nare perfect? Do you not realize that\nthe insurance rates in this statte are\nexcessive? And if you have the wel\nfar of the people at heart, why do\nyou repudiate a man who has evolved\na plan whereby our people would be\nsaved enormous sums for fire protec\ntion ? This money leaves our state,\nnever to return, but goes to enrich\nother sections. Why not keep it at\nhome ? It can be done with McLaurin\nas governor, yet you say he deserted\nthe Reform party.\nDo you not wish a reform \'of our\nprimary election system, so that every\nman can vote according to his honest\nconvictions, without fear of intimida\ntion ? Then do you not wvant these\nballots honestly counteu ? I am un*\ndecr the impression that this is one of\nthe tenets of the Reform party, as\nwell as of all other honest men in\nthe state. If you favor them, wvhy\n(d0 you now repudiate MlcLaurin ? For\nso does he.\nD~o you not very frequently, in the\nhouse .of representatives, raise your\nvoice in protest against extravagant\napplropriations and high taxes? This\ncan bec largely remedied by a budge;\nsystem. Mc Laurin stands for this, as\ndloes the Reform party. D~o you not\nwvant a just system of taxation,\nwhereby each citizen will bear his pro\nrata share of the buraen of govern\nment ? All honest citizens do, wvhether\nreformiers or not, McLaurin among the\nncumber-. Only tax dodgers and their\ndIupes olppose a just and eqluitable re\nform of our tax system. I might cite\nyou numerous other matte*rs ini which\nhe standls for the best interests of our\nstate and for which -all patriotic Re\nformers stand. Yet you repudiate him;\nyou brand him as a traitor to the\nRef ormn parity of South Carvol in, and\nfor what? Blecause, not wishing to oh-.\ntam support under false prletense, he\nboldliy declares his position ini regaird\nto Governor Blease\'s candidacy for the\nUnited States senate.\nBefor-e our country was at war~\nevery one had the right to their per\ns~onal choice among the warring na\ntion:, and to make converts to their\nviews, when they could. But when\nthe toesin of war was sounded, when\nour country had taken sides, when our\nyoung men were being rapidly called\nto the colors and trained for war, so\nthat upon the bloody field of battle\nthey might uphloldl the honor and go\nry and honor of our country, it was\nthe (duty of every citizen to support\nthe government by both word and\n(eed. McLaurin (lid, and thousands\nandl thousands of patriotic reformers\nin this state did lhkewise, andl in (10\ning so (lid nothing but their duty.\nHadl Governor Blease laid asidie his\npersonal hostility for President Wil\nson and at Pomaria, Filbert and\nChapin declaredl we were fighting a\nrighteous war; we were fighting to\nsafeguard the lives of our men, wom\nen andl children from ruthless, brutal\nmurder; we were fighting that civil\nization and Christianity might not\nperish from the earth, he would have\nbeen elected to the senate by a ma\njority so great, that the most un\nDrives Out M lariam, Builds Up Systern\nThe Old stanr general trahintonic\ntend tru, e ton For . lie -\nERX\nLnd efficient Bt\nonce a month\n.e benefit of Bi\nBy keeping y(\nI deal of troubl\nES CO\ngr. P. L. WE\nPros\nscrupulous election thief would not\nhave dared to question his triumph.\nI and thousands of others hoped that\nhe would so declare himself; had he\ndone so, our state would have been\nswept with a wave of patriotic en\nthusiasm and Blease would have tow\nered head and shoulders above any\nman in the state. His patriotism\nwould have been unassailable and fac\ntionalism would have been buried be\nyond hope of resurrection.\nHe did not so speak, but he allowed\nhis personal venom to override his\njudgment; his course was dictated by\nhatred of individuals and not by love\nof country. His speeches, I have no\ndoubt, were reported in Germany, his\npower here was greatly overrated\nthere, and the German nation was ani\nmated to greater resistance because\nthey thought one of our great leaders\nwas their firm friend and supporter.\nIf Governor Blease should be elected\nto the senate, it would inspire the sol\ndiers and people of Germany to great\ner effort; for they would naturally be\nlieve that America was about to drop\nout of the war. Thousands of Amer\nican soldiers, many of them Carolin\nians, would (lie upon the battle field\non account of this delusion. I honest\nly believe that his election would so\nstrengthen the morale of the German\npeople and army that it would be\nequivalent to a reinforcement of a\nquarter of a million soldiers.\nGentlemen, the poet well says:\n"There is a tide in the affairs of men,\nwhich taken at the flood, leads on to\nfortune," Blease did not take it, and\napparently, you are following in his\nwake. Unless you change your course,\nwe may safely predict that the re\nmaining voyages of your lives will be\n"bound in shallows and in miseries."\nIn the past you have admitted Mc\nLaurin\'s ability and patriotism, now\nyou repudiate him because he stands\nfor pure and lofty American patriot\nism; because he upholds the purity of\nwomanhood and the liberty of the hu\nman race. Let me beg of you before\nit is too late to stop, look and listen!\nYours truly,\nLowndcs Browning.\n0\nInstructor Burned to Death\nLake Charles, La., Feb. 10.-Trhom\nas .E.

Donelly, inventor of the\nnon-sinkable construction of the Lu\ncia, a marine engineer of Newv York,\nwill have complete charge of the load\ning of the vessel.\nAlthough the Lucia is fitted with\n12,000 of the water and airtight cells,\npermanently attached to the frames\nand (leek beams and other available\nspaces of the vessel, about 15 to 20\nper~ cent of the cargo space must be\npacked with additional numbers of\n\'Grippe ?\nIPPE\n3ULES\n:. a Dozen.\nor money.\nsirer ?\nMAN NIN6.

Mr. Donnelly\npersonally will supervise this final\nphase of the safety equipment.\nThe first reports of the non-sink\nable ship, announced by William L.,\nSaunders, vice chairman of the naval\nconsulting board ,at a diinLr Satur\nday night to University of l\'ennsyl\nvania alumni, gave all credit for de\nvelopment of Mr. Donnelly\'s contriv\nance to the naval consulting board.\nCommissioner Donald tonight, how\never, said the ship hnd been equipped\nwith the cells under the direction of\nthe shipping board.\nThe board\'s division of shi pprotec\ntion, he said, had recommended to the\nboard ,a:. July the tes; of Mr. Don\nnelly\'s invention, offered to the beard\nat that time.\nThe Lucia, a 9,00-ton vessel, for\nmerly belonged to Austria, was requi\nsitioned for the purpose, and experi\nments wre bgun. Only reently, after\nabout four months of tests and new\ndesigning. the equipment was corn\npleted.\nAlthough no actual test of the\nLucia\'s safety from torpedoes has\nbeen made, the mathemacical calcula\ntions fron small scale experiments,\nsays Mr. Donald, are considered suf\nficient proof that even wi. i a nole\nfeity feet Icng blown in her side, she\nwould remain safely afloat, supported\nby the honeycomb of cells.\nEach cell is a unit, independent of\nany other for its supporting quality\nand the great number of them, in ad\ndition to the ordinary safety device of\nwatertight doors and other watrtight\ncompartments on every seagoing ves\nsel, gives so great a degree of buoyan\ncy that two or three tol-pedoes would\nnot be likely to work havoc enough to\nsink such a ship.\nA vessel so mashed and torn by tor\ntrpedoes, with gaping holes below the\nwaterline, could remain on the surface\nindefinitely, simply water-logged with\nno danger to her crew. Unless unus\nually rent open, she could proceed to\na port, however slowly. In-any event,\nneither lives or cargo would be likely\nto be lost, for succoring vessels either\ncould tow her to port or salvage at\nthe spot the undamaged part of the\ncargo.\nThe final proof of the Lucia\'s float..\ning ability in distress was to have\nbeen made by attempting to sink her\nby flooding her in drydock. This,\nhowever, was deemed, in the face of\nthe expert opinion on the effectiveness\nof th equipment, a waste of time.\nIn the judgment of her inventor andt\nthe shipping board\'s experts the prin\nciple is so certain that no further de\nlay is to be allowed in rushing the\nLucia, unprotected by any warships,\ninto the most infested submarine\nwaters.\n-0\nGREEN\'S AUGUST FLOWER\nhas been used for all ailments that\nare caused by a disordered stomach\nand inactive liver, such as sick head\nache, constipation, sour stomach,\nnervous indigestion, fermentation of\nfood, palpitation of the heart caused\nby gases in the stomach.

Much\ndissatisfaction has been caused among\nfar-mers, who felt that it was unreas\nonable to ask them to buy Northern\nand Western meal wvhen they had\ntheir own home ground meal which\nthey could use. There was no pro\ntest concerning redluction of the con\nsump~tion of flour, but sim ply that.\nthe farmer did not wvish to buy meal\nfrom his store when he had better\nmeail or grits at home.\nU~ndler the new rule the farmer can\nhave his corn ground by a ille1r, who\nwill give him a certificate. This cer\'\ntificate must be filed with the gr\'oceri\nby the -farmer, whe\'reupon hie canf hiuy\nan eqiual amount of flour, nt ini ex\ncess of half a barrel.\nTPhis plan11 was recommned by\npraictically th!e unman imouis ovte of the\nc\'ounty food adlministrators at their\nmeeting in Columbia on the 4th in\nstant, and has been advocated by a\nlarge number of prom inenit people\nhaving kmiowledlge of conditions in\nSouth Carolina.\nT lhe national administ ration wasi by\nwir m Lmeditely consulted aibout it,\nWood\'s Seeds\n---For 1918\nThe patrIotIc duty of farmers and\nIgardenerseverywhereis tices\ncrop and food production, Inten\nsivo farming and gardening, and\nthe liberaluso of fertilizers, together\nwIth proper rotation of crops, so\nas to increase and Improve the fer\ntIlIty and productiveness of the\nland, are all vital and necessary\nconsidcrations at the present tIme.\nWood\'s Descriptive Catalog\nFor 1918 gIves the fullest and most\nup-to-date InformatIon In regard\nto all\nFarm and Garden Seeds\nAnd tells about the best crops to\ngrow, both for profit and home use,\nWrite for Catalog and prices of\nGrass and Clover Seeds, Seed\nPotatoes, Seed Oats, or any\nFarm Seeds Required.\nCatalog Maled \'ree On Reguest.\nT.

For the information of\ncounty food administrators and food\nrepresentatives over this State,millers\nand farmers, he following is a de\nscription of the procedure necessary\nfor farmers to obtain flour upon a\nmiller\'s certificate:\nThe farmer takes his corn to the\nmill and has it ground. He signs a\ncertificate which the millers will have,\nstating number in his family or ten\nants for which he buys, the amount\nof flour he has o.1 hand; anu a;reeirg\nto use in his household equal weights\nof flour and substitutes. Thereupon\nthe miller signs a certificate as to the\nnumber of pounds of meal ground.\nThis certificate is then filed with the\ngrocer, and thereupon the farmer can\nbuy an equal weigit of flour, but in\nno case in excess of one-half barrel.\nThis relieves the only difficulty that\nhas been encountered in South Caro\nThere has been no objection what\nsoever to the reduction in consump\ntion of flour, and the farmer has been\npatriotically ready to reduce his con..\nsumption of flour, but he very nat\nurally did not desire to buy more of\nwhat he already had an abundance in\nhis home.\nBlanks are being mailed to the\ncounty food administrators for dis\ntribution to millers. They were mailed\nyesterday afternoon. Millers should\napply to the county food administra\ntor of his county for the blanks.\niE) CROSS AIDS OFFICERS\nWill Purchase Uniforms to Replace\nLosses on Tuscania\nNew York, Feb. 19.--The A merican\nofficers who were rescued when the\nTuscania was sunk and who lost their\npersonal equipment and clothing wil!\nreceive aid from the A merican Red\nCross.
