        <pre>["Journal of Glaciology, Vol. 31, No. 109, 1985 \nTILL FABRIC AND DEFORMATIONAL STRUCTURES IN DRUMLINS \nNEAR WAUKESHA, WISCONSIN, U.S.A. \nBy SCOTT D . STANFORD* and D AV lD M . MICKELSON \n(Department of Geology and Geophysics, Weeks Hall, University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, U.S.A.) \nABSTRACT. Deep gravel-pit exposures reveal the \ndistribution and structure of till and underlying sand and \ngravel in drumlins near Waukesha, Wisconsin. The subglacial \nsediment is interpreted to have moved laterally into the \ndrumlin sites because the till thickens from the margin to \nthe core of the drumlins, the stone orientation in the till is \nperpendicular and oblique to ice flow on the drumlin \nmargins, and recumbent isoclinal folds occur in sand on the \ndrumlin margins with axes parallel to the drumlin axes. The \nresulting accumulations of sediment presented obstacles to \nice flow and were streamlined into the minimum-drag \ndrumlin shape by erosion on the margins and by remolding \nof material in the core of the drumlins. These drumlin \nnuclei may have formed at spots where there was low \neffective stress on the bed. The subglacial sediment became \nmobile as a result of high pore pressure that may have \ndeveloped as ground water and subglacial melt water were \ntrapped behind a frozen bed at the ice margin. Under \ncertain conditions, however, lateral sediment flow might also \nhave occurred when the sediment was frozen. \nREsUMi.

Geschiebegefilge und Verformungsstrukturen\nin Drumlins bei Waukesha. Wisconsin . U.S .A . \nAufschlUsse in tiefen Kiesgruben lassen die Verteilung und \nStruktur von Schutt sowie von darunterliegendem Sand und \nKies in Drumlins bei Waukesha, Wisconsin, erkennen. Es \nwird angenommen, dass das subglaziale Sediment sich seitlich \nin die Drumlinlagen geschoben hat, da der Schutt vom \nRande zum Kern der Drumlins an Dicke zunimmt, da die \nOrientierung der Steine im Schutt senkrecht und schrllg zum \nEisfluss an den Drumlinrandern verlauft und da liegende, \nisoklinale Falten im Sand an den Drumlinrllndern mit \nAchsen parallel zu den Drumlinachsen auftreten. Die sich \nhieraus ergebenden Anhllufungen von Sediment setzten dem \nEisfluss Hindernisse entgegen und erhielten durch Erosion \nan den RlIndern und durch Nachschub von Material zum \nKern der Drumlins die stromlinienfOrmige Drumlinform \ngeringsten Widerstandes. Diese Drumlinkerne dUrften sich an \nStellen gebildet haben, wo niedrige Normalspannungen am \nBett herrschten. Das subglaziale Sediment wurde infolge \nhohen Porendruckes beweglich, der sich entwickeite, als \nGrundwasser und subglaziales Schmelzwasser hinter einem \ngefrorenen Bett am Eisrand eingeschlossen war. Doch mag \nunter gewissen Bedingungen auch seitIicher Sedimentfluss \naufgetreten sein, wenn das Sediment gefroren war. \nsubglacial material during drumlin formation are then drawn \nfrom these observations. This study is an expansion and \ncontinuation of the work of Whittecar (unpublished) and \nWhittecar and Mickelson (1977, 1979), who first described \nand interpreted the till stratigraphy and deformational \nstructures in these drumlins. Previous workers in this area \ninclude Alden (1905, 1918), who first described the \nmorphology and regional distribution of the drumlins, and \nEvenson (1971), who measured fabric in several drumlins as \npart of a general study on the origin of till fabric. \nDrumlins in south-eastern Wisconsin occur in two \nfields: a small field near Waukesha formed by ice of the \nLake Michigan lobe, and a large, 80 km wide arcuate belt \nof drumlins behind the southern terminus of the Green Bay \nlobe (Fig. I). In this study, nine drumlins in the Waukesha \nfield and two in the Green Bay field were examined (Fig. \nI). Based on the correlation of the drumlin-forming New \nBerlin till (Mickelson and others, 1984) with the Haeger till \nin Illinois, and with till of the Johnstown and Darien \nmoraines in Wisconsin, both the Waukesha and Green Bay \ndrumlins are thought to have formed during advance of ice \nto the Darien and Johnstown moraines ' approximately 14 500 \nB.P. (Whittecar and Mickelson, 1979). The Waukesha \ndrumlins are clustered on uplands (Whittecar, unpublished) \n", ', .... \'"\\ \n./ \\ \n- " .... \\ " ....... ------"\\. \nmOXimU\';~.ltent of ?

The \nclusters are probably on interfluves between stream valleys \ncut through a pre-existing outwash plain. Unlike small \ngravel-cored drumlins described by Kriiger and Thomsen \n(1984), much of the drumlin form here is eroded into this \npre-existing outwash by ice. The Green Bay lobe drumlins \nare generally longer and narrower than the Waukesha \ndrumlins (Mills , 1980, unpublished), and are discrete hills \nwith a less marked tendency to cluster on uplands. \nDISPOSITION OF TILL IN THE DRUMLINS \nBoth the Green Bay and the Waukesha drumlins are at \nleast partially cored and carpeted with a very pale brown \n(IOYR 7/4) sandy loam or loam till. Grain-size analyses on \nmore than 60 samples of the till yielded an average of 64% \nsand (2.0-0.0625 mm), 27% silt (0.0625-{).002 mm), and 9% \nclay « 0.002 mm) in the < 2 mm fraction . In places, till \nnear the surface of the drumlin is enriched in sand and \ncontains stratified sandy and pebbly lenses that we interpret \nas patches of supraglacial debris let down atop the drumlins \nduring final melting (Johnson and others, 1982), but the \nbulk of the till in the drumlins has a uniform, \nwell-compacted matrix and was probably deposited \nsubglacially. In all but one of the drumlins, where the base \nof the till is exposed, the till is thickest in the center of \nthe drumlin. The lower contact of the till dips downward \nas the drumlin surface rises, proceeding from the margin to \nthe core of the drumlin, defining a pod-shaped body of till \nthat is thickest beneath the drumlin crest. Figure 2 \nStanford and Mickelson: Fabric and structures in drumlins \nsummarizes thickness measurements in five drumlins and \ndemonstrates thickening of the till toward the center of the \ndrumlins. This pattern indicates that preferential \naccumulation of till occurred at the drumlin sites. In a few \nplaces, the till can be separated into a lower deformed unit \nof basal till and an upper, undeformed basal till unit that \nconforms to the drumlin shape, suggesting that there were \ntwo episodes of subglacial deposition during the \ndrumlin-forming glaciation possibly one during ice \nadvance and the other during retreat of the ice - separated \nby a period of erosion, deformation, and drumlin formation \n(Whittecar and Mickelson, 1977). \nTILL FABRIC \nIn order to investigate the structure of the \ndrumlin-forming till, fabric was measured at 84 sites in ten \ndrumlins. For each fabric measurement, azimuth and plunge \nof 25, 30, or 50 pebbles were determined using a Brunton \ncompass. Only pebbles with long axis to intermediate axis \nratios of 3 : 2 or greater were measured. The vast majority \nof pebbles measured were dolomite, usually prolate \nellipsoids. \nFifty pebbles are commonly accepted as the minimum \nnumber for a reliable fabric, although 25 pebbles may \naccurately depict the orientation maxima (Young, 1969; \nGrieco, unpublished). In the course of measuring fabric for \nthis study, comparison of the orientations obtained from the \nfirst 25 pebbles of a 50 pebble sample with the 50 pebble \norientation showed that, for fabrics with clearly defined \nmaxima, plots of the first 25 pebbles faithfully replicated \nthe 50 pebble plots to within 10°. Based on this \nobservation, 25 (or 30) pebble measurements were judged to \nbe adequate if they showed a clear maximum; if no clear \nmaximum appeared, 50 pebbles were measured. Using this \ntechnique, 25 pebbles were measured at 36 sites, 30 pebbles \nwere measured at four sites, and 50 pebbles were measured \nat 44 sites. The fabric data were then plotted by computer \non equal-area projections of lower hemispheres using the \n100 \nVI \nVI ., \nc: \n.>< \n0 . ~ \nQ \n- 50 - VI ., .>< \n~ .~ \n.~ .c:: -0 \nt \n0 \nc: \n0 \n0 \no Woukesho \n6 Porkwoy \n- SUSSex \n+ New Berlin \n, Holes \n/1-6_6 " \\ \n0 \n\\ \n\\ \n• \n6 \n+ \n\\ \n6 \'\\ \n• , , \n6 \n+ ,\'\\\n+ \n\\ \n\'\\ 6 0 \n• \n\\ \n\'\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n• \\ \n\\ \n\'\\ 6 \\ -\'\\ 0 \\ 6 \\ ,\\0 + \n\'\\ 6 • \n, \n-\'\\ \n\'\\ ++ -\'\\ \n\'\\ t.\' \n\'\\ + , , \'\\+ , \'\\ , 0 , \n\'\\ 6 \n50 \nnormalized distance from center of \n(center=O. margin = 100) \n, \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \nA ,\\ 6 \\ \n_ \\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n100 \ndrumlin \nFig. 2.

Corbato, \nOhio State University). \nThe origin of till fabric has been the subject of a \nnumber of papers. In theory, elongated particles immersed \nin a flowing medium (whether it be water, ice, or viscous \nsediment) will orient to attain a position of minimum \ntorque. Rusnak (1957) presented the following equation for \nthe torque (T) on a particle in terms of the fluid density \n(p), fluid velocity (11), length of the long (a) and \nintermediate (b) axes of the particle, and the angle (p) \nbetween the a-axis of the particle and the mean velocity \nvector \nT z -np(tr - b2) 112 sin p cos p. \nThe torque goes to zero, indicating a stable position, when \np equals lI/2 (that is, when the long axis is transverse to \nflow) and when p equals • (that is, when the long axis is \nparallel to flow [longitudinal orientation)). \nFor a lone particle lying parallel to flow, slight \nvelocity fluctuations in the fluid will tend to rotate the \nparticle into a transverse alignment; thus, the transverse \nposition is more stable. But, if a number of particles \nimpinge on each other in the fluid, the transverse \norientation gives rise to frequent collisions, and the \nlongitudinal orientation is more stable. A longitudinal \norientation would also be expected in extending flow, where \nfluid in front of the particle is moving faster than fluid \nbehind the particle, thus tending to rotate the front of the \nparticle parallel to the flow direction. Therefore, in a \npebble-rich material such as till or debris-laden ice, a \nlongitudinal orientation would be expected to be the stable \ncondition and fabric maxima should indicate the direction \nof movement of the ice or of viscous till. \nHowever, transverse orientations in debris-rich material \nhave been described in areas of compressive flow, where \nfluid above and behind the particle is moving faster than \nfluid below and in front. For example, transverse fabric is \nobserved on the margins of debris flows and in sheared-up \ndebris bands in ice (Boulton, [c 1971)). Possibly, this \ntransverse fabric is produced by the velocity gradient set up \nacross the up-flow and down-flow ends of a particle in \nlongitudinal orientation when it enters a compressive-flow \nregime. Fluid moving against the up-flow end of the \nparticle will have a slightly higher velocity than fluid \nmoving at the down-flow end. Any slight fluctuation in the \nflow direction will thus set up a torque tending to rotate \nthe up-flow end until a transverse orientation is attained, \nand there is no appreciable velocity gradient across the \nparticle. In general, then, a longitudinal fabric forms in \nextending flow and in debris-rich flow, and a transverse \nfabric forms in compressive flow and in debris-poor flow. \nTill fabric has commonly been interpreted as being \nproduced englacially and preserved upon melting out or \nmass lodgement (Glen and others, 1957· Harrison 1957· c " , \nBoulton, [1971)), or produced during particle-by-particle \nlodgement at the sole (Holmes, 1941). MacClintock and \nDreimanis (1964) demonstrated re-orientation of fabric in \nwet till during a later advance and established that \npost-depositional flow of till can create a fabric. Based, in \npart, on their work, Evenson (1971) interpreted fabric in \nthe Green Bay lobe drumlin field as the product of \npost-depositional movement of viscous till. Englacial and \nlodgement-till fabric, then, reflect local ice-flow direction, \nwhereas post-depositional fabrics (produced either in \nsupraglacial or subglacial environments) record the flow \ndirection of viscous till, which may not coincide with ice \nflow. \nThe till fabric of drumlins and flutes has been studied \nin a number of areas. Donner and West (1955), Wright \n(1957), Evenson (1971), and Walker (1973) all reported \nfabric that is generally parallel to the drumlin axis. Young \n(1969) and Hill (1971) found that drumlin fabric has steeper \nplunges and tends to be weaker than fabric in till plains. \nHill (1971) and Kriiger and Thomsen (1984) also noted that \nsome fabric deviates considerably (more than 30°) from the \ndrumlin axis; this deviation is attributed to deflection of ice \naround the flanks of the drumlins. Gravenor and Meneley \n(1958), based on microfabric measured in flutes and \ndrumlins in Alberta, also reported deviation of fabric \n222 \nmaxima away from the drumlin or flute axis, especially at \ndepths greater than 3 m [10 ft) below the surface. They \ninterpreted these deviations as remnant orientations produced \nby former ice flow before superimposition of the flutes . \nShaw and Freschauf (1973) measured both micro- and \nmacro fabric in large flutes (up to 20 m high) and found \nthat they converged towards the flute axis and plunged \nup-glacier. This fabric was interpreted as the record of \nhelicoidal flow in the ice, with till accumulated in flutes at \nthe convergence of upward-rotating parts of adjacent flow \ncells. Boulton (1976) found that fabric in small-scale flutes \nin Svalbard points into the flute and plunges steeply \nbeneath the flute crest, indicating squeeze-up of till into \nsubglacial cavities formed in the lee of obstacles. Savage \n(unpublished) and Grieco (unpublished) measured fabric on \nthe margins and ends of drumlins in New York and \nobserved accordance of fabric maxima with expected flow \nlines of ice moving plastically around the drumlin. This \nfabric pattern was cited as evidence for drumlin accretion \nby plastering-on of layers of till. \nFor the most part, these investigations have been \nrestricted to near-surface fabric because of shallow \nexposures. Little information is available on fabric in the \ncores of drumlins. The deep exposures available in the \nWaukesha area afforded an opportunity to obtain such \nfabric information. Fabric was measured at depths ranging \nfrom 2 to 39 m below the surface. At II sites, where \ngullies were eroded into the pit walls, fabric was measured \nat several depths to determine vertical as well as lateral \nvariability within the drumlin. Figures 3, 4, and 5 are maps \nof three pits showing the location of structural data and \nlower-hemisphere projections of fabric measurements. \nAs can be seen on the maps, most of the fabric is \nparallel to the drumlin axes but fabric that is perpendicular \nand oblique to ice flow is not uncommon (Figs 4 and 5). \nThe perpendicular fabric tends to occur between the. margin \nand core of the drumlins at depths greater than 6 m and, \nwhere overlying fabric can be measured (e.g. Fig. 5), it is \nparallel to ice flow. Three of the perpendicular fabric \nmeasurements are close to the surface and may be in \nslumped material (or in supraglacial till), but the other 14 \nMAP LEGEND \n. ..... ... . \nCONTOUR LINE (CONTOUR \nINTERVAL IS 10 FEET) \nCONTOUR BEFORE EXCAVATION \nPIT WALL (AS Of AUGUST, 1981) \nCLASTIC DIKE \nUPRIGHT ANTICLINE \nUPRIGHT S,(NClINE \nRECUMBENT FOLD \nLOWER -HEMISPHERE.

Note perpendicular fabric (WK66, \nWK71 , WK68 , WK74). \nperpendicular measurements are in uniform basal till that is \nclearly traceable to, and is not visibly or analytically \ndifferent from, till having the parallel fabric . \nGiven its position in the drumlins, it is unlikely that \nthe perpendicular fabric is a transverse fabric produced by \ncompressive flow in the ice itself or by compressive \nconditions transmitted from the ice into the underlying till \nduring drumlin formation. In accordance with Bernoulli's \ntheorem, fluids will have greater pressure and slower \nvelocity (a compressive regime) on the up-flow end of an \nobstacle, but on the sides and down- flow end of the \nobstacle the pressure is less and velocity is greater, thereby \ndefining an extending flow regime (see also Savage, \nunpublished) . Ice depositing or molding till into a drumlin \nthen would not be under compressive flow at the marginal \nposition in which the perpendicular fabric is commonly \nfound. \nOne interpretation of fabric perpendicular to ice flow \nis that the perpendicular fabric is actually a longitudinal \nfabric formed by lateral flow of remobilized till toward the \ndrumlin site rather than fabric created by shear or \ndeposition from flowing ice. This remobilization fabric is \nsimilar in origin to the fabric in flutes described by \nBoulton (1976). The fabric pattern described by Shaw and \nStall/ord and Mickelson : Fabric and structures in drumlills \nFreschauf (1973) and the anomalous fabric orientations \nperpendicular and oblique to drumlin axes observed by \nother authors (see above) may have a similar origin. Such \nfabric, as the product of flow within previously deposited \ntill, may be wholly independent of the ice-flow direction. \nFabric parallel to ice flow is more common and is \nfound in the cores and on the margins near the surface of \nthe drumlins. Parallelism with ice flow suggests that such \nfabric is primarily a longitudinal fabric produced during \noriginal deposition rather than a remobilization fabric. This \ndeposition, however, was probably not synchronous with \ndrumlin formation, because, if large-scale deposition of till \noccurs primarily in a zone near the margin, as suggested by \nmany authors (for example, Sugden and John, 1976; West, \n1977; Whittecar and Mickelson, 1979), and if drumlins are \nformed up-ice from this zone of deposition (Whittecar and \nMickelson, 1979), it is unlikely that primary deposition from \nice at the time of drumlin formation is the agent \nresponsible for the bulk of the till in the drumlin or for \nthe fabric of that till . Instead, the parallel fabric found in \nmost of the till in the drumlin may have been produced \neither during pre-drumlin subglacial deposition or it may be \npost-depositional fabric imprinted during shearing of till by \nice moving over and around the drumlin. This latter \npossibility is particularly applicable to fabric parallel to ice \nflow that is found just above till with a perpendicular \nfabric. \nSTRUCTURE OF THE SAND AND GRAVEL \nThick sand and gravel occurs beneath the till in the \ndrumlins. It is predominantly either horizontally bedded or \ntilted and truncated by the till . However, intense \ndeformation is not unusual, especially in sand. This \ndeformation is of three types: (I) recumbent isoclinal folds, \n(2) upright isoclinal to open folds, and (3) clastic dikes. \nFaults, although described by Whittecar (unpublished), were \nnot observed in exposures between 1981 and 1983. \nThe recumbent isoclinal folds occur between the edge \nand core of the drumlins, usually under relatively thin till \n(1.5--6 m thick). Orientation of the axes of these folds is \nconsistent at a given location and axes tend to be either \nnearly perpendicular to the drumlin axis or nearly parallel \nto the axis (Fig. 3). Where the folds occur in sand (Fig. 6), \namplitudes are on the order of 0.3-1 m; wavelengths are \nusually less than 0.6 m. In gravel, amplitudes are more than \n3 m and wavelengths are approximately 1.5-3 m. This \ndifference in size is due both to the thicker bedding in the \ngravel and to the greater angle of internal friction of the \ngravel (both in the dry and frozen state). The greater angle \nof internal friction of the gravel imparts a greater shear \nstrength than that of sand and hinders internal deformation, \nthereby preventing small-amplitude folds. \nThe recumbent folds with axes perpendicular to ice \nflow are probably drag folds produced by shear from \nover-riding ice. Recumbent folds with axes parallel to the \ndrumlin axis are probably not the result of drag from \nFig. 6. Photograph of a recumbent isoclillal fold in sand. \nThe fold axis is parallel to the drumlin axis. \n223 \n", 'Journal of Glaciology \nover-riding ice. Instead, these folds may be similar to \nrecumbent folds that have been observed and experimentally \nproduced in liquefied sand. \nWilliams (I 960) observed that loosely packed fine sand \nand silt will collapse if sheared. If such sediment is \nsaturated, confined, and then sheared, it will liquefy; that \nis, its shear strength will drop as the loose packing \ndisintegrates and the pore fluid assumes the load . \nLiquefaction, in turn, may allow flow if an external force \nis applied (as, for example, by unequal vertical loading). \nFlow will be laminar and recumbent folds will develop as \nmanifestations of flowing bands moving at different \nvelocities. Fold axes will be perpendicular to the flow \ndirection. Similar behavior has been described by McKee \nand others (I962) for a sand layer confined by silt strata. \nThey found that high pore pressure in the sand led to \nrecumbent folds where a horizontal pore-pressure gradient \noccurred across the sand layer. \nApplying these observations to the recumbent folds \nwith axes parallel to the drumlin axes suggests that they \nformed by flow of liquefied sediment toward the drumlin \nsite, either in response to a greater weight of ice in the \ninter-drumlin areas or to flow of water through the \nsediment toward the drumlin site. The parallelism of the \nfold axes with ice flow rules out drag from over-riding \nice, and the regularity of the folds and lack of thinning \nor thickening of the beds argues against a down-slope slump \norigin. Sites where fold axes adopt oblique or ambiguous \norientations with respect to the drumlin axis may have \nundergone two folding episodes: an original set produced by \nflow toward the drumlin and a later set produced by ice \ndrag, resulting in a deformational pattern similar to that \ndescribed by Boulton (I976) in modern flutes. \nUpright folds are less common, though more \nspectacular, than the recumbent folds. They occur singly and \nare of much larger amplitude (as much as 12 m) than the \nrecumbent folds, suggesting the presence of a larger-scale \nstress field. These folds are composed of sand, gravel, and \ntill layers (Fig. 7), and are found both on the margin and \nin the core of the drumlins. Axes of these folds are both \nparallel and perpendicular to ice flow. \nThe origin of these upright folds is more problematic \nthan that of the recumbent folds because no clear analog \nexists in non-glacial sediment. Those folds having axes \nperpendicular to ice flow may be ice-push folds that did \nnot become overturned and were later truncated by erosion. \nThe marginal folds with axes parallel to ice flow are \nprobably not related to the ice flow, and the presence of \nsilt, gravel, and thin till layers, as well as their upright, \nlarge-amplitude geometry and isolated occurrence, rules out \nliquefied sediment flow because horizontal flow of liquefied \nsediment would not produce upright folds involving several \nsediment layers folded concordantly. One possibility is that \nthey are compressive folds produced by the weight of \nsediment in the drumlin (and of the ice overlying the \ndrumlin) acting laterally against the drumlin margin.

Ice flow was \ndirectly into the photograph. \nthese conditions, upright marginal folds of large amplitude \nmight be formed locally if high pore pressure lowers the \nyield strength of the sediment so as to permit ductile \ndeformation. \nClastic dikes are vertical bodies of layered sand and, in \nsome cases, gravel and till, which intrude upward into and, \nat places, through the upper till (Fig. 8). They are usually \nfound in the drumlin cores and commonly trend parallel to \nthe drumlin axis, although several dikes described by \nWhittecar (unpublished) are perpendicular to the drumlin \naxis. Dike widths range from 1 m to 9 m; vertical \ndimensions are more obscure because the bottoms . of the \ndikes are rarely exposed. Minimum vertical dimensions range \nfrom 1.5 m to 6 m. At two sites where longitudinal \ndimensions could be observed, the dikes were linear and \ntabular in shape, although Whittecar (unpublished) described \nseveral dikes which were domes or doubly plunging \nantiforms. \nTill fabric was measured in and near the dikes at two \nlocations. Fabric in the intruded till adjacent to the margins \nof the dikes does not show steepened plunge but does tend \nto be re-oriented toward the dike. Fabric in till in the \ndikes or immediately next to the dikes does show steepened \nplunge. These findings suggest that the till enclosing the \nclastic dike did not deform in concert with the material in \nthe dike but rather acted as a rigid layer into and through \nwhich the underlying sediment intruded. Where dikes can \nbe seen to intrude sand and gravel, bedding next to the \ndike is deformed but the dike penetrates the bedding of the \ngravel (Fig. 8). \nA striking feature of the clastic dikes is the \npreservation of primary stratification. Stratification, defined \nby interbedded layers of varying grain-size, is always \ncontinuous, parallel to the dike walls, and only rarely \ninterrupted by isolated, small-scale intrafolial isoclinal folds \n(with axes parallel to the dike). At several sites this \nstratification is traceable laterally to horizontal strata, \nindicating that it is primary stratification and not \nf1ow- banding. \nStratification is not commonly observed in dikes in \nsedimentary rocks (Potter and Pettijohn, 1963) and, where it \nhas been described (Waterson, 1950; Peterson, 1968), it is \ninterpreted as an intrusion phenomenon rather than as \nprimary depositional layering. This absence of primary \nbedding in dikes in sedimentary rocks is perhaps the result \nof turbulent flow during injection, or of the massive or \nthickly bedded character of the source beds. Presumably, \nhowever, there is a continuum from low-viscosity, \nrapid-injection density-inversion structures such as clastic \ndikes, in which turbulent flow occurs and bedding is not \npreserved, to high-viscosity, diapiric density-inversion \nstructures such as salt domes or load structures in which \nlaminar flow occurs and bedding is preserved. The fact that \nbedding is preserved in at least some drumlin dikes, then, \nis indicative of a laminar, diapiric-type rise of low-density, \nliquefied sediment into a denser, rigid till or sand and \n', 'gravel cap. The presence of thin layers of till and gravel \n(which do not reaily undergo liquefaction) in the dikes \nperhaps indicates that either movement of the enclosing \nliquefied sand was capable of deforming the interstratified \ntill and gravel or that gravel and till strata were penetrated \nand upwarped, and included by the upwelling sand \n(Whittecar, unpublished). \nMECHANICAL BEHA VIOR OF SUBGLACIAL MATERIAL \nThe till fabric , folds, and clastic dikes described above \nare indicative of ductile deformation of the till, sand, and \ngravel, but they provide no direct indication of whether the \nsediment was wet or frozen, or of the magnitude of the \nnormal and effective stresses at the base of the ice. The \nfollowing discussion is an attempt to address these issues. \nThe ability of sediment to deform is dependent on the \ngrain-size and the water (or ice) content of the sediment; \nthe direction, magnitude, and distribution of the subglacial \nstresses; the strain-rate; and the duration of stress \napplication. In general, fine grain-size, abundant water, \nlarge confining stresses, slow strain-rates, and long durations \nof stress application encourage ductile behavior (deformation \nby plastico-viscous yield); coarse, dry materials subjected to \nquick loading behave elastically (deformation by brittle \nfracture) (Scott, 1979; Kaplar, 1971). Any postulated value \nfor these quantities in the subglacial environment well \nbehind the margin where drumlins form is of necessity \nspeculative. However, some plausible statements can be \nproferred based upon assumed basal conditions and ice \nthickness. \nWet conditions would be expected at the base of a \ntemperate glacier or at the base of a sufficiently thick polar \nglacier owing to geothermal melting of ice at the \npressure-melting point. If the subglacial water is slowly \ndrained or not drained, sediment will be saturated and the \npore pressure will increase. The effect of pore pressure on \nthe shear strength of the sediment is expressed by the \nMohr-<::oulomb equation \nS = C + (an - u) tan ell. \nAs pore pressure (u) increases, the effective stress (an - u) \ndecreases and the shear strength (S) is diminished (C is the \ncohesion and ell is the angle of internal friction). Therefore, \nin saturated conditions where high pore pressure exists, the \nshear strength of the sediment is lowered and deformation \nresults if the high pore pressure is not balanced by greater \nnormal stress. The style of deformation might be analogous \nto the behavior of debris-flow material that is texturally \nsimilar to till. As analyzed by Johnson (1970), debris flows \nbehave as a plastico-viscous substance; that is, they flow \nviscously once a yield strength is surpassed. Below this yield \nstrength, little or no permanent deformation occurs. If this \nrheologic analogy is valid, perpendicular fabric in the till \nand folding in the sand and gravel could be the \nmanifestations of viscous flow of sediment into the drumlin \nsite when it is subjected to a shear stress greater than its \nyield strength. \nRough estimates of basal normal stress and shear stress \ncan be calculated knowing the ice-surface profile and the \nunit weight of ice, but subglacial pore pressure and the \nyield strength and viscosity of wet sediment under confined \nconditions are unknown. However, the existence of \nsqueeze-up till ridges near the margins of modern glaciers \nunder thin ice (Boulton, 1976) and the prevalence of softsediment\ndeformation in fluvial and marine environments \ndemonstrate that, where pore pressure is high, yield \nstrengths are often sufficiently small to permit sediment \nflow. High pore pressure in the subglacial environment \ncould arise from blockage of ground-water discharge areas \nby ice and from trapping of basal melt water behind a \nfrozen-bed margin or in material of low hydraulic \nconductivity (Boulton, [c 1975]). \nDuctile failure can also occur under frozen conditions. \nUniaxial and triaxial compression tests and direct shear tests \nhave been performed on frozen soils by the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers (Scott, 1969; Kaplar, 1971; Sayles, 1974; \nSayles and Haines, 1974; Haynes and Karalius, 1977) and by \nRussian . engineers (Tsytovich, [c 1975]) under a variety of \nStan/ord and Mickelson: Fabric and structures in drumlins \nstrain-rates, temperatures, ice contents, and grain-sizes. In \ngeneral, it is observed that at high strain-rates brittle \ndeformation occurs; at low strain-rates ductile deformation \noccurs. Plastico-viscous yield strength (the "creep strength" \nor "ultimate strength") is an order of magnitude lower than \nbrittle strength (Scott, 1969; Sayles and Haines, 1974) and \nwas found to increase as confining pressure increased \n(Alkire and Andersland, 1973; Sayles, 1974), temperature \ndecreased, and strain-rate increased (Sayles and Haines, \n1974). Maximum compressive strength (ranging from 6300 \nkN m- 2 for coarse sand to 9100 kN m-2 for fine sand) was \nobserved for ratios of volume of ice to volume of soil \nbetween 0.2 and 0.4 for coarse sand and between 0.4 and \n0.7 for fine sand (Kaplar, 1971). At smaller and larger ice \ncontents, compressive strength dropped to less than 1400 \nkN m-2 for both fine and coarse sand. \nDuctile failure of frozen soil, then, is favored by slow \nstrain-rates, temperatures close to freezing, and ice-to-soil \nratios less than approximately 0.3 or greater than \napproximately 0.6. Most of the yield-strength values \nreported by the U .S. Corps of Engineers and by Tsytovich \n[c 1975]) are derived from uniaxial (unconfined) compressive \ntesting and so are not directly applicable to the confined \nconditions beneath the ice. Sayles (1974), however, \nconducted triaxial creep tests on frozen sand at -3.8°C \n(ice-to-soil ratio approximately 0.6) and at various \nstrain-rates. He found that the creep-strength failure \nenvelope leveled off at confining pressures greater than \n2700 kN m-2 and that lowering the strain-rate caused yield \nat lesser shear stresses. Kaplar (1971) presented data on \nuniaxial compressive strength and direct shear strength \nindicating that frozen till (grain-size and ice content not \nspecified), at temperatures close to freezing, has a similar \nshear strength but a lower compressive strength (both \ninstantaneous and creep) than frozen sand. The failure \nenvelopes of Sayles, then, may be considered as rough \napproximations to (or maximum limits for) till-failure \nenvelopes, especially for sandy till such as that at Waukesha. \nTo determine if the stress conditions under the ice at \nthe site of the Waukesha drumlins are sufficient to cause \nductile failure of frozen till and sand, the stresses on a unit \nvolume of material must be specified. Assuming a polar \nglacier, a plausible ice profile is that of Antarctic ice: h4.7(xO.5),\nwhere h is the ice thickness and x is the distance \nfrom the margin (Hollin, 1962). The Waukesha drumlins are \napproximately 50 km from the margin at the Darien \nmoraine (Fig. I); thus, h - 1051 m. (Note that the Kettle \nmoraine, although much closer to the drumlins, is an \ninterlobate moraine and so does not mark the origin of an \nuninterrupted ice profile.) The unit weight (y) of ice at \n-4°C is equal to the density of ice (999 kg m-s) multiplied \nby the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m s-2); thus, y = \n9800 N m-so The normal stress on the bed (an) is equal to \nthe unit weight of the ice multiplied by the height of the \noverlying ice column (= yh). At Waukesha, then, an = \n10 300 kN m-2. The ice surface slope (a) is obtained by \ntaking the arc tangent of the derivative of the profile \nequation \ndh \na = arc tan = arc tan \ndx [ \n4.7 ] \n2(xO.5 ) • \nAt x = 50 000 m, Cl = 0.60°. The basal shear stress (T) is \ngiven by the equation T = yh sin CL In this case, then, T \n= 109 kN m- 2• The horizontal confining pressure (ab,) on a \nunit volume of sediment can be approximated by usmg the \ncoefficient of Earth pressure (K), which is the ratio of \nhorizontal (ah) to vertical (av ) stress on material below the \nEarth\'s surface. For frozen sediment where pore pressure is \nnegligible, the normal stress is equal to the effective stress, \nand ah = Kav (Sowers, 1979). K is related to Poisson\'s ratio \n- the ratio of transverse to longitudinal strain - by the \nequation (Sowers, 1979) K - v/(I - v), where v is the \nPoisson\'s ratio for the material in question. Tsytovich \n([cI975]) reported Poisson\'s ratios of 0.41 for frozen sand at \n-<J.2°C, falling to 0.13 at -o.8°C. For a frozen silty loam \nat -<J.3°C he reported a Poisson\'s ratio of 0.35, decreasing \nrapidly to 0.18 at -<J.gOC, and levelling off at 0.13 as \ntemperatures fall below -1.5°C. The Poisson\'s ratio for the \n225 \n', 'Journal of Glaciology \nsandy loam till at Waukesha, to extrapolate from these \nvalues, would be in the range of 0. 1~.13 for temperatures \nof about -4°C, yielding a K value of approximately 0.14. \nThus, given these assumptions, and observing that beneath \nthe glacier the vertical stress (a v) is equal to the basal \nnormal stress (an)\' one finds that ah = Kan = 14(10 300) = \n1400 kN m-2• The resulting Mohr circle, both with and \nwithout basal shear stress added, is shown in Figure 9. \n6000 \n\'" E ..... \n~ 4000 \nt \nVI \nVI \n! 2000 VI \n~ \n0 \n~ \nVI \n0 \n0 \nfailure envelopes for frozen sond \nat -3.85·C (from Soyles, 1974) \nwithout basal shear \nI \n2QCX) 4000 6QCX) 8000 \nnormol stress (eT), kN/m2 \n£=0.02 i-I \n£=0.004 min-I \n, \n10QCX) 12000 \nFig. 9. Mohr circle for subglacial stress conditions at \nWaukesha during maximum extent of the ice, assuming an \nAntarctic-type ice-surface profile, a temperature of \napproximately _5°C and a Poisson\'s ratio of 0.10 for the \nfrozen subglacial sediment. \nIt is clear from the figure that the postulated stress \nconditions intersect the creep-failure envelope of frozen \nsand experiencing a strain-rate of 0.24 S- 1 (0.004 min-1). \nMoreover, the strain-rate of ice (and, by extension, a \nball-park estimate of the strain-rate of deforming subglacial \nsediment) under a shear stress of lOO kN m-2 (= I bar), \naccording to Glen\'s law, is on the order of 6 x 10-9 S- 1 \n(Paterson, 1969). Such slow strain-rates, to extrapolate from \nSayles\' findings, would further lower the yield strength and \nincrease the likelihood of viscous flow. On the other hand, \nyield strengths increase linearly as temperature decreases. \nThe exact form of the relationship depends on strain-rate \nand grain-size (Sayles and Haines, 1974; Tsytovich [cI975]; \nHaynes and Karalius, 1977); however, a drop in temperature \nfrom _loC to -15°C can nearly double the yield strength \nof frozen sand (Tsytovich, [cI975]). Thus, the likelihood of \nflow of frozen sediment decreases rapidly as temperatures \nfall. \nIn conclusion, flow will occur in either wet or frozen \ntill and sand if the yield strength of the sediment is \nexceeded. Although laboratory data on the strength of wet \nand saturated sediment are lacking, the morphologic \nevidence of squeeze-up till ridges near the margins of \npresent-day glaciers, and the common occurrence of \nsoft-sediment deformation in non-glacial environments, \nsuggests that yield strengths of wet sediment are sufficiently \nlow under certain pore pressures to readily permit flow if a \ndifferential stress is applied. The case for flow of frozen \nsediment is more complex because the yield strength \ndepends on the strain-rate, temperature, grain-size, and ice \ncontent of the till. Assuming a temperature of approximately \n-4°C and an Antarctic-type ice-surface profile, and \nassuming that the rheologic behavior of the till and sand at \nWaukesha is roughly similar to that of frozen sand with an \nice-to-soil ratio of 0.6, it appears that the yield strength \nwould be exceeded and that the till and sand would be \nable to flow from regions of high normal stress on the bed \ninto loci of low normal stress on the bed. Loci of low \nnormal stress would occur where the weight of overlying \nice is lowered, for example, beneath thinned ice or clear \nice. We suggest that these mark the position of future \ndrumlin sites. Thus, these considerations do not argue for or \nagainst the suggestions of Baranowski (1979) that drumlins \nrepresent frozen parts of the glacier bed. \n226 \nGENESIS OF THE DRUMLINS \nDrumlins are streamlined subglacial landforms that \npresent minimum drag to ice flow around an obstacle \n(Chorley, 1959). As such, two questions seem pertinent to \nthe origin of drumlins: (I) how was the obstacle produced, \nand (2) how was streamlining achieved? As emphasized by \nBoulton (1976), drumlins are morphologically defined \nlandforms and, since a number of processes may produce \nsimilar or identical morphologies, there need not be a single \norigin for all drumlins. Thus, there are no doubt several \ncorrect answers to the above questions and any postulated \norigin for drumlins applies, of necessity, to a specific set of \ndrumlins. \nWith this limitation in mind, we suggest the following \nsequence of events in the formation of the drumlins in \nsouth-eastern Wisconsin (modified from Whittecar and \nMickelson (1979»: \n(1) Basal till is deposited in a marginal zone as the ice \nadvances, resulting in a sheet of till blanketing the \npre-advance drift topography. \n(2) Till and underlying sand and gravel, if mobile, \nflow laterally into sites on the bed where the effective \nstress is low. Perhaps this is beneath the thinnest ice (for \nexample, perhaps below an intensely crevassed area or an \n"erosional mark" as proposed by Shaw (1983), or cleanest \nice). At these sites, the normal stress on the bed is lower \nthan on surrounding parts of the bed and lateral flow of \nsediment continues until the weight distribution above an \narbitrary horizon is equalized, that is, when the "thinned" \nice column is compensated by a thickened sediment column \n(Fig. 10, panels I to 3). The observed thickening of the till \nfrom the margin to the core of the drumlins indicates \naccumulation of sediment at the drumlin site, and the \nobserved presence of till fabric that is perpendicular to ice \nflow, and of recumbent folds in sand with axes parallel to \nice flow in the margins of the drumlin, is evidence for \nlateral sediment flow towards the drumlin site. The sediment \naccumulations that result from this flow are drumlin nuclei; \nthey are obstacles to ice flow, and consist of sediment that \nCD MOBILE \nSEDIMENT \n........... _-_ .... --h~\'\n~ f--\'--_.c\':- T -:\'0>----1 \n® CD \n------ .... ----I.\nPRIOR TO LATERAL FLOW OF SEDIMENT. \nCTI = Y ICE hi \nCT2 = YICE h2 \nhi < h2 \n:.

Change in \nice thickness could be due to crevassing. Similar results \ncould be produced by differences in density of the \noverlying column but with equal ice thickness . \n', 'can be shaped by erosion and remolding into a streamlined \nform. \nIf the sediment is completely frozen, flow will occur \nonly under special combinations of ice thickness, \ntemperature, strain-rate, and ice content. However, if the \nsediment is unfrozen or partially frozen, increases in pore \npressure that are not matched by equivalent increases in \nnormal stress will reduce the effective stress, lower the \nshear strength, and readily enhance sediment mobility. Such \nincreases in pore pressure could be produced by rapid \nloading and compaction of slowly drained or undrained \nsediment due to ice advance (Vaiden and others, 1982) and \nby blockage of pre-glacial ground-water discharge areas by \nice. Drainage of the subglacial water, in turn, would be \nimpaired or halted by aquitards (Clayton and Moran, 1974) \nand by freezing of the glacier on to a permafrost bed at \nthe margin (Mickelson and Clayton, 1981). Thus, advance of \nice over water-bearing sediment induces abnormally elevated \n(excess) pore pressure in the sediment and thereby creates \nconditions favorable for drumlin nucleation. \nAtop subglacial uplands the ice is thinner, and the \nnormal stress less, than over subglacial lowlands. If the pore \npressure is approximately constant throughout the subglacial \nsediment, tlle thinner ice on the uplands results in lower \neffective stress and more mobile sediment than in lowlands. \nThe magnitude of this reduction, assuming a pre-glacial \nrelief of approximately 100 m and an ice thickness of \napproximately 1000 m (see above), is on the order of 10% \n- a fraction that could be significant if the sediment is \nnearly mobile. Sediment flow and drumlin nucleation \ntherefore occurs preferentially on upland areas beneath the \nice, accounting for the observed clustering of drumlins on \nuplands. \nThus, we feel that much sediment movement takes \nplace because of local differences in effective stress rather \nthan shear stress due to ice flow as proposed by many (e.g. \nBoulton, 1982). This mechanism could be used in \nconjunction with the proposal by Shaw (1983) that drumlins \nform in erosional marks at the base of the ice, although the \nmechanism for producing the erosion marks is \nundocumented. Our observations of the character of the \nsand and gravel, in places the flat upper surface of the \ngravel, the accordant levels of the gravel in drumlins, and \nradiocarbon-dated wood from the gravel, indicate that the \ngravel pre-existed the drumlin formation. The gravel is not \na cavity filling deposited beneath the ice. \n(3) The accumulation of material in these proto-drumlin \nsites presents an obstruction to ice flow and flow lines are \ndiverted around the obstacle. Strengthening of the \nobstruction may occur by dissipation of pore water through \nunderlying sand and gravel, as suggested by Menzies \n(1 979[a]). Streamlining of the obstruction into the \nminimum-drag drumlin shape is achieved by remolding and \nerosion (Fig. 10, panel 4). Till in the center of the drumlin \nflows into a streamlined shape in response to shear \ntransmitted from over-riding ice seeking a flow pattern of \nminimum drag. Higher ice-flow velocities (and possibly \nfreezing-on conditions) on the drumlin flanks and \ninter-drumlin areas promote extensive erosion of the till and \nunderlying outwash from these areas, also emphasizing the \nstreamlined form. In the field, truncation of the till and \nbedded sand and gravel at the drumlin flanks attests to the \nextensive erosion of inter-drumlin areas, and the prevalence \nof till fabric parallel to ice flow, especially close to the \ndrumlin surface above perpendicular fabric, may reflect \nlocal remolding from over-riding ice. \n(4) Next, another basal till is deposited as a carpet \nover the drumlinized topography, either during retreat of \nthe ice or under thick ice shortly after formation of the \ndrumlins. \n(5) Lastly, a discontinuous drape of supraglacial till is \ndeposited on the landscape during final melting of the ice. \nOn a regional scale, the occurrence of drumlins in a \nbelt behind the ice margin may mark the location of a zone \nof ice that is partially frozen to the bed. This zone, in \nturn, marks the transition from a frozen bed at the margin \nStanford and Mickelson: Fabric and structures in drumlins \nto an unfrozen bed farther up-glacier. On the basis of \ngeomorphologic evidence, Mickelson and Clayton (1981) \nargued that a frozen bed was present at the margin of the \nGreen Bay lobe and the northern Lake Michigan lobe \nduring late Wisconsin time. As mentioned above, this might \nallow high pore pressure to develop in unfrozen-bed areas \nbehind the margin. Erosion would occur in areas where ice \nunder compressive flow was freezing on to the bed and \nthereby lifting material off the bed. These observations \nsuggest that the drumlins may have formed in the \nunfrozen-bed parts of the partially frozen zone where \nmobile sediment was present and that inter-drumlin areas, \nwhere extensive erosion has occurred, may represent \nfrozen-bed parts or zones of freezing-on. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to thank Drs P.
