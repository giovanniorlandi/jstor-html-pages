ROBERT M SWEITZER.\nThe affable and efficient clerk of the County Court of Cook County, who may he\ninduced by his army of warm friends to enter the race for Mayor of Chi\ncago in 1915.\nThe five White commissioners and the\nthree Afro-American commissioners se\nlected by Governor Edward P. Dunne,\nto assist to celebrate the 50 years of\nfreedom among the Colored people\nresiding in this state in 1915, have al\nready started in to fight like cats and\ndogs over money matters, the White\ncommissioners look upon or regard the\nColored commissioners as mere figure\nheads or real weaklings and at the\nmeeting held by the commission in this\ncity last Thursday, the White commis\nsioners closed their eyes real tight and\nwhile several of the Colored commis\nsioners were doing a little praying, the\nWhite commissioners proceeded to select\nan auditing committee consisting of\nthree of their number, freezing out the\nColored commissioners and the White\nauditing committee will have charge\nof all the money collected in, count\nit and place it in a bank at Springfield\nand from time to time inform Major\nFord the Colored commissioner and the\nso-called Treasurer of the commission\njust how much money they have on\nhand but he will not be allowed to\ncount or handle it\nIt is evident that the White commis\nsioners have no confidence in the Col\nored commissioners when it comes right\ndown to mixing their fingers m the\nmoney and the Colored commissioners\nfeel that as long as the affair was\ngotten up for -the Colored people that\nthey are entitled to share some of the\nhigher honors in assisting to conduct\nthe celebration, hence the figbting and\nscrapping amongtbemselves.\nAt the last meeting of the commis\nsion in this city and come to think of\nit iha pommission meets somewhere\nonce each week to look over copies of\nthe few letters that are being sent out\nby the two or three secretaries who\nwanted to grab off three or four thou\nsand dollars each year for the next\ntwo years for doing nothing, it decided\nto send out Colored solicitors to beg\nmoney, so that the commissioners can\nwine and dine IhemBelves\'and live on\nthe best in the land all the time and to\nassist one or two little Colored men\nto give pink teas, elaborate banquets\nand receptions at the expense of all\nthe tax (payers of Illinois.\nIt was far from the minds f "the\nmembers of the Legislature when they\nin good faith voted to appropriate\n$25,000, to assist the Colored peoplo in\nthis state to. celebrate their freedom in\n1915, that they and their friends wrere\nindirectly aiding several dishonest\ntricksters to work up a huge scheme\nto rob and plunder the hard working\npeople out of their money.\nThere is no reason on earth why the\ncommissioners should at this time be\nattempting to collect money in from\nTom, Dick and Harry unless they want\nto spend it for high living for they are\nnot doing a thing and there is nothing\nfor them to do except to sit around\nand look wise and draw their per\ndiem everytime they travel a few miles\non the railroads and if we are not mis\ntaken some of them ride on free\npasses.\nThe Bev. Honorable Archibald Jack\nson Carey, should make an honest ef\nfort to enter the names of all the mem\nbers of his highly accomplished family\non the payroll of the commission\nand help more quickly to eat up the\n$25,000 appropriated for the celebra\ntion for if he could do so it would\nbe very pleasing indeed to his metho\ndist God.\nSome of the commissioners are heart\nily in favor of holding the celebration\nat Springfield, HI. This should not be,\nfor many of its best and-leading White\ncitizens, in 1908, joined in helping, to\nmob and lynch innocent and law abid\ning Colored men, women and children\nand shot them down in cold blood, de\nstroyed their property and drove some\nof the oldest and most highly respected\nColored men and women from its bord\ners, like wild beasts or dangerous criminals.\nBROTHER\nAN-\nJULIUS TAYLOR\nGRY.\nGovernor Edward P. Dunne and the\nappointees on tho board of commis\nsioners for the Fiftieth Anniversary\ncelebration of tho freedom of the Ne\ngro, has given Brother Julius xayior,\n.fr nf The Broad Ax, some concern,\nand Brother Taylor has not been slow\nin letting it be known, xno eui\ncomes out with some very plain talk,\na part of which there appears some\njustification. He asks, "Why is it\nihera is not a Negro woman on that\nboard! In this Mr. Taylor is not so\nfar off. It is a timely question, my\n.. . 7T . -.r -p t. Tfct vis. Mrs. Fan-\nis it tna .. -. -;-\' T -p w\naie Barrier Williams, Mrs. L B.

Why is there not\none on the board f But as to the lo-\nlitical phase Editor Taylor complains\nof, it is not supposed to be a political\naffair. The members appointed, we\nbelieve, were selected because of their\nfitness and no Negro Democrat ap\npointed because there was no Negro\nDemocrat\'s name presented. While we\ndo know there are excellent men in\nthe Democratic party and just as capa\nble of attending to the affairs of the\nexposition as any one on the commis\nsion, but as we stated, it is not and\nshould not be a question of party, but\nit is essentially racial and there should\nbe a Negro woman on thnt board of\ncommissioners, because of it being a\nrace celebration. There ought not\nbe any reason for complaint against\nthose already chosen, because they are\namong that class that are used to do\ning things in the most progressive\nway, but there is something wrong in\nnot having a representative Negro\nwoman on that commission. The Illi\nnois Idea, July 19, 1913;\nAccording to our way of thinking\nthere is only one Afro-American who\nis connected with the commission that\namounts to anything in the business\nworld, and that is Major Robert B.\nJackson. As for Major ord, ne nas\nno record in this state aside from be\ning in charge of the national dead or\nburying grounds, near Springfield, and\nwe have been informed that he pays\nno taxes in this state; that he is sim\nply a servant of the federal govern\nment and he is a dead one and has no\nmoral right to pose as a representa\ntive of the Afro-Americans residing in\nthis commonwealth.\nAs for Bev. Honorable Archibald\nJackson Carey, the Colored people\nhave elevated him much higher than\nhe has elevated himself, for they make\nit possible for him and his family to\nlive on the fat of tne iana every u\nand Sunday, too, while many of those\nsame Colored people deny themselves\nmany of the. comforts of life in order\nto do so, and if the aev. ionorauc\nArchibald Jackson Carey was driven\nout of the pulpit for preaching poli\ntics, with all of his so-called ability\nhe could not turn his hand to anything\nand honorably earn one hundred per\nmonth. Editor.\nA NEGRO EXPOSITION.\nThe business and professional Negro\nmen of Chicago arc considering the ad\nvisability of organizing a national\nNegro exposition and semi-centennial\nto be held in this city in 1915. The\npurpose of the exposition is to exploit\nthe skill of the Negro craftsman and,\npresumably, to show how greatly the\nNegro has progressed in civilization\nsince his emancipation in America.\nIt is an excellent idea and it is to be\nhoped that it will be carried out. The\nyear 1915 will mark a half century\nsince the American Negro has been\nfree. In that time he has accomplished\na great deal, but the full story of his\naccomplishment is not as well known\noutside of his own race as it should be.\nAn exposition such as the one proposed\nwill tell thnt story more fully and\nvividly than in any other way, and it\nis a story not only worth the telling\nbut highly necessary to be told.\nAt Buch an exposition the country\nwill be enabled to see with its own\neyes what the Negro has done and\nwhat he is capable of doing. The re\nsult of this should be that much of the\nsenseless prejudice existing concerning\nhim will receive a most effective blow.\nThe Inter Ocean, Chicago, July 22,\n1913.\nTHEY ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH SECTION 1454 OF THE CITY ORDI\nNANCE OF CHICAGO PERTAIOTNG TO IMPROPER NOISE AND WITH\nTHE STATUTES OF ILLINOIS ELABORATDTG ON THE SAME SUBJECT.\nMANY COLORED BOYS H)LE THEIR TTMTi AWAY IN ROAMING THE\nSTREETS AND MAKING LIFE MISERABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE\nFORCED TO LIVE NEAR UNTO THKM.\nSOME OF THIS CLASS OF BOYS CARRY FIRE ARMS AND OTHER\nDEADLY WEAPONS AND THE POLICE SHOULD GET AFTER THEM\nWITH A SHARP STICK.\nAND SEE TO IT THAT THE PARENTS, RELATIVES OR GUARDIANS OF\nSUCH BOYS K\'THUtt KEEP THEM AT HOME OUT OP MISCHIEF OR\nCOMPEL THEM TO GO TO WORK AT SOMETHING TO ENABLE THEM\nTO EARN AN HONEST LIVING.\nSO THAT THEY MAY GROW UP AND BECOME USEFUL AND RESPECTED\nYOUNG MEN IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY RESnE AND\nNOT CANDIDATES FOR THE PENAL INSTITUTIONS OF COOK\n- COUNTY AND ILLINOIS.\nTHE ANTI-NOD3E COMMITTEE OP THE CITY COUNCIL CONTINUES TO\nDO SPLENDID WORK TN THAT DIRECTION.\nCAPTAIN P.

There have been nine other\nchildren, all living and well, and the\nproud parents are comparatively\nyoung.\nMr. and Mrs. Winner are seenuagjjr\ndoing their "part to assist to increase\nthe population of this grand old world.\nEditor.\nIt is strange indeed that so many\npeople who claim to be highly edu\ncated, both White and Colored citizens\nalike, are at the same time absolutely\nignorant of the laws in relation to\ntheir so-called right to make all the\nunnecessary noise they please as long\nas they pay rent for the premises they\noccupy or own.\nThe preachers and the Sunday-school\nteachers and it would bo time well\nspent if the school teachers would also\njoin in and help to educate and in\nstruct the people and the school chil\ndren to cultivate the habit of not\nmaking so much unnecessary noise.\nThe state and the city laws in this re\nspect should be read to them by the\npreachers from their pulpits at least\nonce a month, and the same thing\nshould be done in the Sunday-schools\nand in the public schools.\nAs stated before, they are unfa\nmiliar with section 1454 of the city or\ndinance of Chicago pertaining to im\nproper or unnecessary noise and with\nthe statutes of Illinois touching upon\nthe same subject.\nThe city ordinance on this point\nreads as follows:\n"City Ordinance, Sec. 1454. All per\nsons who shall make, aid, countenance\nor assist in making any improper\nnoise, riot, disturbance, breach of the\npeace or diversion tending to a breach\nof the peace within the limits of the\ncity; all persons who shall collect in\nbodies or crowds for unlawful pur\nposes, or for any purpose, to the an\nnoyance or disturbance of other per\nsons shall be deemed guilty of\ndisorderly conduct and upon convic\ntion thereof shall be severally subject\nto a fine of not less than one dollar\nnor more than two hundred dollars for\neach offense."\nThe stautes of Illinois very plainly\nspeaks ont along the same lines in this\nrespect; it is as follows:\n"Criminal Code, Chap. 38, Sec 140.\nWhoever disturbs the peace and quiet\nof any neighborhood or family, by\nloud or unusual noises, or by tumul\ntuous or -offensive carriage, threaten\ning, traducing, quarreling, challenging\nto fight or fighting shall be fined\nnot exceeding $100."\nThe city ordinance and the statutes\nof Illinois also provide heavy fines\nand imprisonment for those who per\nsist in. carrying revolvers and other\ndancerous weapons of every descrip\ntion, for it is unlawful for them to\ndo so nnless they are omcers oi w\nlaw or have a speeial permit to do so,\nand many times they are fined two\nhundred dollars and sent to the bride\nwell for six months to one year for\ntoting around concealed weapons in\ntheir hip pockets.\nIt is not very pleasant to make this\nstatement, nevertheless it is true, just\nthe same namely, that there are many\nColored boys residing in all parts of\nChicago who idle their time away in\nroaming the streets and making life\nmiserable for people who are forced to\nlive near unto them; they are taught\nby their parents not to have the slight\nest consideration for the rights of other\npeople, nor to respect those who are\nolder than themselves and the result\nis that they endeavor to make them\nselves just as offensive as they can be\nat all times and they really feel that\nalthough their parents are compelled\nto work hard in order to provide them\nwith something to eat, clothing for\ntheir backs and with a place to sleep,\nstill they regard their parents as igno\nrant back numbers and they sass or\nbluff them out on the slightest occa\nsion and they, the boys entertain the\nidea that they are far above the law.\nSome of this class of Colored boys\nload themselves down with fire arms\nand with other deadly weapons and\nthe poliee should get after them with\na sharp stick and see to it that the\nparents, relatives or guardians of such ,\nboys either keep them at home out of\nmischief or compel them to go to work\nat something to enable them to earn\nan honest living.\nSo that in time they may grow up\nto honorable manhood and become use\nful and highly respected young men\nin the communities in which they re\nside and not candidates for the penal\ninstitutions of Cook County and BJi- t\nnois.\nThe anti-noise committee of the city\ncouncil continues to do splendid work\nin that direction, the following 57 . \'\nnoises have been placed under the po\nlice ban by the five aldermen com\nposing the anti-noise committee of that\nbody, and the work of the committee\nhas been divided off into five separater \'\ndivisions with the following aldermen\nserving as chairmen:\nAid.

Nance, chairman\nof the health committee of the city\ncouncil and head of the anti-noise com\nmittee states, that in certain parts of\nthe city the police, are not hurting\nthemselves in the way of attempting\nto suppress so much unnecessary noise.\nBut we are firmly of the opinion,\nthat, Captain P. J. Lavin of the Hyde\nPark district and his able assistant\nlieutenant John L. Hogan in charge\nof the 50th Street station and the other\npolice officials in the Hyde Park dis\ntrict, are doing their part to abolish\nor suppress so much unnecessary noise.\nHEALTH NOTES.\nA noted medical authority has said\nthat only one man in a million dies\na natural death. We should live un\ntil one hundred and forty .years of age.\nA man who dies at seventy or eighty\nyears is the victim of an accident and\nhe is deprived of the forty or fifty\nyears that Nature still owes him.\nIn 1837 Sidney Smith wrote: "I\nam convinced that digestion is the\ngreat secret of life; and that charac\nter, talents and virtues are powerfully\naffected by beef, mutton, pie crusts\nand rich soups." In 18S4, Dr. Andrew\nBlyth said: "When by successive re\nsearches the science of diet has be\ncome better understood, without doubt\na school of physicians will arise, dis\ncarding all drugs and treating all mal\nadies by cutting off certain foods and\nby surfeiting with others." " There\nare diets," 6ays the same authority,\n"for every age, for every climate, for\nevery species of work, physical or men\ntal; there are diets by which diseases\nmay be prevented or eured; there are\ndiets fitted for some constitutions, in\njurious to others; diets which make\nthe skin glossy, the frame rigorous\nand the spirit joyous; others which\nmar the face with wrinkles, speckle\nthe body with eruptions and make the\nform lean, hollow and prematurely\nold."\nIn an article on digestive disor\nders, Dr. D. H. Kress, editor of life\nsnd Health, says: \' "Very few per\nsons reach adult life without the con\nsciousness of possessing a, stomach."\n"Americans," he says, "possess the\nreputation of being a race of dyspep\ntics. It is safe to say that not less\nthan seventy-five per cent, of them, are\nafflicted with some form of digestive\ndisorders. Back, of nearly every form\nof these ailments Is the. food, and back\nof these is the cook. What the in\nmates, of -the. home are physically and\nmorally may usually be determined by\nwhat, tie cooVi; \'Give s thoroughly\n-trained, and. intelligent cooks and the\n- cure of -nine-tenths of aH.-the dyspep\ntics .may be assured, without-medicinal\nL--lL . .. \' \' \'\ntreatment."\nAre you still fighting the fiyt Do\nyou permit these nasty, dangerous\npests to invade your -borne f Remem\nber the war is on for all the summer\nand autumn months; also do not for\nget that files carry the germs of dis\nease as a dog does fleas. The only\nsafe thing for you to do is to exclude\nthem from your home. And as there\nare few communities in Chicago so\nclean that flies can find no breeding\nplaces in them, so there are flies\neverywhere.\nFlies carry typhoid, dysentary, tu\nberculosis, diphtheria, epidemic sore\neyes, cholera, etc. They are dangerous\nfor the reason that it is known they\nspread disease. The most effective\nway to fight flies is to remove their\nbreeding places. Flies breed in filth.\nBemove the filth and the flics will\nsoon disappear.\nWhen the weather is hot, don\'t wor\nry. Keep your temper; it will help\nyou to keep cool. Use plenty of water\nboth inside and out. Don\'t eat too\nmuch. Keep regular hours. Stay ont\nof doors as much as possible. Don\'t\nlook at a thermometer. Take the\nshady side of the street and don\'t\nhurry.\nWOMEN HAVE UNDRESS ORGY.\nLondon Times\' Criticism Causes Storm\nof Comment.\nAlmost Nothing Now Worn.\nDifficult for Writer to Predict to What\nEnd Fashions Will Go.\nLondon, July 21. A storm of com\nment has been aroused by an article\ndisplayed prominently in the Times\nunder tho caption "Dress or Un\ndress." The writer declares:\n"We are at the height of a revolu\ntion in feminine clothes which has not\nbeen seen since the French reolution\ngave sanction to the excesses of wom\nen in the directoire and empire gowns.\n"Five years ago women still woro\nskirts and bodices which eovered them,\nstockings thick enough not to show\nthe color of their skin, and sufficient\nstays and petticoats to conceal the de\ntails of their persons. The wasp\nwaists and humps on the skirt or\nshoulders disappeared.\nWear Almost Nothing.\n"It was the return of nature to true\nart, but to-day it is patent, at least\nto the observant person, that women\nwear almost nothing under their\ngowns oven in the daytime. Petticoats\nhave been replaced by tights lor\nhave they been replaced! and the\nstockings are of such diaphanous silk\nas to embarrass the beholder.\n"So much for tho foundation. Over\nthis is a film sheath of half transpar\nent material cut almost as low for day\nwear as for evening, with such slash\nings that the lifting of the skirt will\nfully display the leg half way to the\nknee, showing every movement ot tue\nlimb and almost of the muscles.\n"Certainly there is an orgy of un\ndressing going on and it shows no\nsigns of abating. What will be the\nend! It is difficult to see."\nComes at Time of Crisis.\nThe writer concludes with this high\nly conservative note:\n"It is curious to note that this Bac\nchanalian rage has fallen on women at\na time when there is much in the melt\ning pot, at a time of world restless\nness, of war abroad and a constitu\ntional crisis at home and social misery\neverywhere.\n"It is difficult to see the connection\nof fashion with such things or to say\nwhich is the cause and what the ef\nfect or to determine how much the\nwoman\'s almost bare feet and quite\nbare arms and neck are due to Premier\nAsquith\'s indifference to stable gov\nernment, or to anarchy in the political\nand artistic world.\n"But it says a great deal for the\nlength of the road which we have trav\neled that the old fashioned people have\nnot lifted up their voices in rebuke to\na generation which would have made\ntheir fathers gasp and stare ana re\nsort to prayer to avert a thunderbolt."\nFOREST NOTES.\nA shingle mill in Maine nses 2,000\ncords of paper birch each year in the\nmanufacture of toothpicks.\nTho new Chineso Republic has es\ntablished a department of agriculture\nand forestry.

The Influence for good which\nthis cx-HsitIon will have upon the peo\nple of New York canuot fail to be of\nfarrenchlng consequences.\nTo any one who has observed closely\nthe salient features of the race prob\nlem it must have become apparent;\nthat the paramount need of all con\ncerned is to have a better, fuller\nknowledge of the past of the Negro\nrace and. possessing this, to accord it\nIts due privileges and opportunities for\nthe presi\'iit ami thus to render possible\nits attainment of a future still more\nworthy of recognition and considera\ntion than anything It has yet achieved.\nThe tentative program of the com\nmission covers an exhibit in thirteen\ndivisions, comprising (1) Africa, show\ning a historical map of the continent,\nwith particular reference to the parts\noccupied by Negroes and the arts and\ncrafts of the race at home; (2) charts\nand diagrams Indicating distribution\nof Negro blood throughout the world\nand the growth of the race in America.\n(3) health and physique.

BARNETT DODSON.\nNew York. Having received letters\nfrom a number of publishers in refer\nence to the responsibility of the\nHaynes Advertising agency In this\ncity, I considered it my duty to make\na personal investigation In order to\nfurnish the members of the National\nNegro Press association with Impartial\nand accurate Information. To my\nmind an advertising agency Is subject\nonly to the control of the periodicals\nwhich it represents.\nI had the pleasure of calling upon\nthe Haynes Advertising agency a few\ndays ago and was most cordially re\nceived by Mr. Haynes. who Is the\nproprietor of the business. After a\nfew brief preliminary remarks I stated\nmy mission, and without the least hesi\ntation Mr. Haynes in the most Intelli\ngent way outlined bis method of op\neration. Mr. Haynes says: "This agency is\nthe outcome of nearly two years strug\ngle against many obstacles. One is\nthat of general racial prejudice, which\nIs a universal" handicap. Another most\nvital feature Is that In a number of\ncases we have not been able to get\naccurate and efficient service from\nmany of the colored publishers. The\nmethods of general advertising have\nbeen greatly changed in recent years.\nThe most important additional feature\nIs the \'key system." which has been\nadopted by nil of the big advertisers.\nBy this method each medium carrying\nan advertisement Is recorded by the\nadvertiser and is known by different\nnumbers. For instance, one publication\nIs known by department C, another Is\nknown by department 24. and so on.\n"This system enables the advertiser\nto systematically check up replies\nfrom each medium carrying his adver\ntisement, thus showing the actual re\nsults of each Individual periodical in\nwhich his advertisement appears. This\none feature alone has created extra ex\npense in stamps, stationery and time,\ncorresponding with publishers, In\nstructing them to insert \'key num\nbers\' correctly. We have written as\nmany as six letters to some of these\npublishers on this one point before\nwe could make them understand it\n"Advertisers will not pay for any\nnewspaper advertisements until suf\nficient proof of Insertions Is estab\nlished. This Important feature has\nbeen entirely ignored by many.\n"A great many who have been car\nrying advertisements from this office\nhave failed to send in voucher copies\nbearing the advertisement This also\nhas greatly disturbed our routine."\nI was then shown sufficient proof\nthat legal action had been started\nagainst an advertiser In order to make\ncollection for publications that had\ncomplied with Instructions by Insert\ning their proper key numbers and\nsending in voucher copies of their\npublications. In this particular case\nMr. Haynes claimed that he had noti\nfied the publishers to whom he was\nIndebted that he would be personally\nresponsible for all bills If collections\nwere not made within a limited time\nMr. Haynes further said: "The su\npremacy of this agency has been made\npossible by my most comprehensive\ncombination rate plan, and careful\nstudy and experiment have proved that\nmy system is the most effective and\nproductive service to offer the big ad-\'\nvertisera. There is no Individual -Negro\npublication having enough cir\nculation to interest the big advertiser":\nconsequently the combination of from\nten to a hundred publications offer\ning a combined circulation of many\nthousands Is absolutely the only propo\nsition that will attract the attention of\nthe big advertiser to this class of pub\nlication. "From an ethical standpoint it is\nnot- improper, unsafe or unwise in\ngrouping together any number of pub\nlications In order to accomplish a thin?\nthat could not be done otherwise. -I\nmight add that through my most favor\nable connections with the United Pub\nlishers\' association and many of the\nlarge white advertising agencies of- "\nthe country I am quite confident that\nwithin a short time this establishment\nwin be a creditable asset to the colored ,\npublishers of this country. My advice\nto the colored publishers throughout\nthe country Is to give more attention .\nto circulation. That is the essential\nchord on which the big advertisers\nPlay."\nMr. Haynes Is a member of the Na\ntional Negro Press, association, and his\nlong practical experience in business\nshould give him first hand knowledge\nas to business principles, and I believe\nthat bis agency Is absolutely reliable\nand offers the most tangible and prac-\ntieal proposition eiexJbefore brought\nto tho attention of the Dig advertisers. .\nAt present about \'one-third of the-.,\ncolored periodicals of America are\nrepresented by, membership In the Na\ntional Negro Press association. ,\n-3\n1\n);\ntAae-ij\n-nlSi.UiiSA.-\nirt, - -\n.-..\n3 . ;,\n, - .', '\'\'VJMjpUff-MyiJM\'JPJ\'-, " \'T1\n.\nIC\nfr\nw,\nBfe,\nIf\nrSSX 1XOAD AX OAK 33 FOUND\nOH BALK AS TEE POELOWXHO\nWBWS STANDS:\nTroa on snd after tMi dxte The\nBroad Ar, cxn tw fonnd on sal at the\nfollowing neirs stands:\nA.
