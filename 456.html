VERY LITTLE\nQUESTIONED.\nThere have been booms in almost\nevery civilized country and they were\nlooked upon as such, and in the course\nof time the bubble was pricked and\nthey burst. But in no country has the\ndevelopment been as great nor as\nrapid, whether in city or in country,\nas in Western Canada. There may\nsometimes be found one who will say\n"Can It last?" Winnipeg, today, stands\nwhere Chicago stands as far as be\ning the base of the great commercial\nand agricultural country lying a\nthousand miles back of it. It has an\nadvantage that Chicago did not have,\nfor no country in the world\'s history\nhas attracted to its borders a larger\nnumber of settlers in so short a time,\nor has attracted so much wealth in a\nperiod of equal length, as have the\nCanadian prairies. Never before has\npioneering been accomplished under\nconditions so favorable as those that\nexist In Western Canada today.\nThe provinces of Manitoba, Sas\nkatchewan, and Alberta have the\nlargest area of desirable lands on the\nNorth American Continent, and their\ncultivation has just begun.\nEven with a two hundred million\nbushel wheat crop less than eight per\ncent, of the land is under the plough,\nfour per cent, being in wheat. Less\nthan five years ago the wheat crop\nwas only seventy-one million bushels.\nIt is a simple calculation to estimate\nthat if four per cent, of the available\ncultivable area produces something\nover two hundred million bushels,\nwhat will forty-four per cent, produce?\nAnd then look at the immigration that\nis coming into the country. In 1901\nit was 49,149; 17,000 being from the\nUnited States. In 1906 it was 189,064,\nof which 57,000 were Americans, and\nin 1912 it was about 400,000, of which\nabout 200,000 are Americans. In the\nthree years prior to 1912, there were\n358,859 persons who declared them\nselves for Canada, who brought into\nCanada in cash, bank drafts, stock,\nimplements and effects over $350,000,\n000. Why have they gone to Canada?\nThe American farmer is a man of\nshrewd business instincts, and when\nhe finds that he can sell his own farm\nat from $100 to $200 per acre and move\ninto Canada and homestead 160 acres\nfor himself, and similarly for all hi3\nsons who are adult and of age, upon\nlands as rich and fertile as those he ;\nhad left, and producing, indeed, sev- i\neral bushels to the acre in excess of j\nanything he has ever known, it will\ntake more than an ordinary effort to ;\nprevent him from making the change, j\nHe can also purchase good lands at j\nfrom $12 to $25 per acre. i\nAnd, then, too, there Is the Ameri- I\ncan capital following the capital of j\nbrawn, muscle and sinew, following it j\nso as to keep in touch with the Indus- j\ntrious farmer with which he has had\ndealings for years back. This capital\nand the capital of farming experience\nIs no small matter in the building up\nof a country.\nWill Western Canada\'s development\ncontinue? Why not? The total area\nof land reported as available for cul\ntivation is estimated as 218,000,000\nacres; only fifteen per cent, of this is\nunder cultivation. Nothing Is said of\nthe great mineral and forest wealth,\nof which but little . has yet been\ntouched.

It began In my hair\nfirst with red blotches, then scaly,\nspreading to my face. The blotches\nwere red on my face, dry and scaly.\nnot large; on my scalp they were\nlarger, some scabby.

Jardine, Acting Director of the Station, Tells What Has Been\nDone and What He and His Men Hope to Do in the Future\nThe State is Receiving Benefits of Experiments\nThat Cost the People But Little.\nWHEN a county gives the land\nand its encouragement to in\nduce scientific fanning on a\nlarge scale by the state it is fairly cer\ntain that it will not lose money. Fin\nney county, in the western part of\nKansas, wouldn\'t give up its experi\nment station now although there once\nwere farmers out there who scoffed\nat the idea. Finney county leased a\nhalf-section of land to the state agri-\n.\'.-\'-WJ\n1\nFirst Experiment Station at Garden\nCity.\ncultural college in 1006 for one dollar\na year provided the state would main\ntain and operate an experiment sta\ntion thereon.\nThe state entered into a tentative\nagreement with the United States De\npartment of Agriculture to do co\noperative work in dry land agriculture\ninvestigations. The legislature of 1907\ndid not appropriate money for the\nstate\'s part of the work, but realizing\nthe importance of the work at this\npoint, the government stationed a man\nthere and the agricultural college, out\nof its general funds, bought a team\nof horses, a wagon, buggy, plow, lister,\ndisc, and a one-horse cultivator. A\nshack was constructed from ah old\ncattle shed and in this the man in\ncharge of the station batched for four\nyears, keeping the horses in a rear\nroom in bad weather. During these\nfour years the United States Depart\nment of Agriculture paid the salary of\nthe man while the college paid part\nof the few expenses for maintenance.\nIn the spring of 1911 the. state legis\nlature approprited $7,500 for equip\nment and maintenance for the two\nsucceeding years of 1911-\'12 and\n1912-\'13. This money was expended\non machinery, horses, the erection of\n\'buildings, and in preparing more land\nfor experimental purposes. While "this\namount is just about one-half what is\ngenerally recognized as the amount\nneeded to put a station of this char\nacter on its feet for the first two jears\nit was a start.\nAs soon as the state had given the\nstation money to work with, the of-\nPresent Experiment Station at Garden\nCity.\nfice of irrigation investigations of the\nUnited States Department of Agri\nculture, recognizing the importance of\ninvestigating deep-well irrigation at a\npoint where so many characters are\ntypical of a vast area of the south\nwest plains country, signified a desire\nto enter into co-operative work- with\nthe state on the experiment station.\nA well was put down and a model\npumping plant constructed costing,\nthe well included, $6,200. Of this the\nirigation investigation office of \' the\nUnited States Department of Agricul-\nBETTER SEED, BETTER YIELDS\nThe work in testing varieties and\nbreeding crops at the Kansas Kxperi\nment Station, has shown that it is\npossible to increase the average yield\nof the standard crops in this state\n25 per cent by the single factor of in\ntroducing and planting pure seed of\nwell bred and high producing va\nrieties. One of. the improved; vari\neties of winter-wheat grown on the\nIvansas Agricultural College farm,\nactually produced 12 bushels more\ngrain an acre every year, or . a net\nannual profit of nearly $7 an acre as\nan average for three years; above that\nproduced by common scrub wheat , of\ni the same type. Farmers all over the\nstate, who have planted this Improved\nwheat, have reported similar "results,\nthe increase in yield from the well\nbred wheat being often much larger\nthan the differences obtained at the\nstation. v\nTo clean the incubator scrub with\nhot water and soap.

The land was\nplotted for irrigation purposes and\nexperiments in the use of different\namounts of water for- staple crops\nstarted in 1912.\nDuring the season of 1912 the office\nof dry land agriculture, United States\ndepartment of agriculture, erected a\nsoil testing laboratory. This buil. ling\nis the only one on the place in which\nwork of a laboratory nature can be\ndone. It will be made use of for office\nand laboratory work of the station\nstaff.\nAt present the station has a valu\nable pumping plant from which ex\nperiments of interest to the whole\nsouthwest plains country can be con\nducted. It has a neat, fire-proof sciJs\nlaboratory where an expert appointed\nby the government will conduct high\nly scientific and practical work of im\nportance not only to the community,\nbut to all of -western Kansas. It has\nwork in cultivation methods which\nhas been carried cn by the govern\nment for six years and Is giving very\nvaluable insight into how to handle\nthe soils of the west one-half of the\nstate. Provided money is appropri\nated by the state to do i:s share of\nthe work, the United States depart\nment of agriculture is eager to send\nexperts out to work on -the improve\nment of crops on this station where\nSoil Testing Laboratory.\nboth \'irrigation and dry farming can\nbe practiced. No other\' station of the\nsouthwest plains country has irrigation.-\n.\nWhile the station is well equipped\nto an extent, it. is . woefully lacking\nalong other lines. This station has\nfewer facilities than any other sta\ntion on the Great Plains of the West,\nwhich is doing co-operative govern\nment and \' state work. It has only\nthree horses, inadequate machinery\nfor its varied work, only a very small\nand cramped chouse for its foreman,\nand no sleeping quarters for the men.\nThose who do the labor on the station,\nand the government experts, have\nbeen either sleeping in a tent or liv\ning in town, five miles distant. The\nstation has no seed \' house in which\nto store high-priced, improved seed\nthat it grows, and no place to store\nmachinery.\nAt present there are about one hun\ndred acres in cultivation. About one\nthird cf this is under-\' the ditch. It\nis possible, if found desirable, to\nwater practically "all .of the 320 acres\nfrom the well. More land will, be\nbroken up this winter. As soon is\npracticable, sixty to seventy-five acres\nwill be watered. This will furnish\nabundant feed for the farm stock, in\ncluding the dairy herd which it is\n.hoped will be placed here, and area\non which different forage and grain\ncrops can have their relative merits\nthoroughly listed.\nAbove the ditch about forty acres\nwill be devoted to different methods\nof cultivation, ntl about forty acres\nwill be . used in . crop improvement\nwork, such as variety testing and se\nlection, and breeding for drouth re\nsistance ancrarliness. -\nTHE SORGHUM CROP IN KANSAS\nThe sorghums are adapted to with\nstand heat and shortages" of moisture.\nThey are capable of lying -dormant\nduring long" spells and then producing\na splendid grov.th upon receiving\nrain late in the season. Sorghums\nreadily adapt themselves to the condi\ntions peculiar- to - Kansas and are\nynong the most reliable and profit\nable summer crops to grow. They ara\nquite as well adapted to almost every\npart of the state as corn, and, if\ngrown, will be ound to be very close\ncompetitors of corn even in the best\ncorn sections, while in the western\npart of-the state they produce larger\nyields than. corn. - In feeding, value,\ntheir grain, hay, and\' silage compare\nfavorably with other crops. --\nThe general, term sorghum includes\nnot only those .sweet sorts erroneously\ncalled "cane," but also the kafirs,\nmilo, broom, corn, and several others.\nThose having sweet juice are called\nsaccharine sorghums, while :those hav\nInga. juice which is comparatively\npacking in sweetness \'-\'are, called non\ngaccharise sgrghamg. ." ..\n(iraigliieii That Lame Eac\nBackache is one of Nature\'s warnings of kidney weakness.

Why,\nhe must be thirty-five."\n"And she\'s eight and twenty if she\'s\na day. They say all London was crazy\nover her last season. Such a talented\nyoung woman, and perfectly \'irre\nproachable!" You can\'t say as much\nabout all those singers. Why, the\nDuchess of Eastbourne took her un\nder her wing and introduced her ev\nerywhere. I was reading an account\nof her life; it reads like a romance.\nHer father was just an ordinary\nAmerican, and she saved up and went\nto Italy, and there she was adopted\nby a rich count, or something of the\nsort, who made her his ward and left\nher his fortune on condition that she\nwould change her name."\n"What was her name?"\n"O, Smith or Jones or Robinson\nsomething very ordinary. \' I wonder\nwhen he\'s going to propose."\nHut neither of the lovers dreamed\nthat they were the subject of univer\nsal gossip aboard. Absorbed in one\nanother, they leaned over the ship\'s\nrail and watched the long streak of\nfoam glistening in the moonlight in\nthe wake of the "Albania."\nThey had not much to say on .that\nevening, for the realization of his love\nfor the beautiful singer had come to\nthe Englishman quite suddenly, and\nwhen it was too late to withdraw. He\nfelt that he must tell her no?, be-\nWatched the Long Streak of Foam\ncause it would be easier for her and\nfor himself too; things had gone too\nfar for that merely friendly farewell\nand hand-clasp which means so much\nand hides so much more.\'\n"Alice," he began they had called\neach other by their given names al\nmost since the beginning of their ac\nquaintance, so intimately did they\nfeel the sense of spiritual union be\ntween them "Alice, I\'ve behaved like\na cur toward you."\n"Why?" she asked, looking at him\nwith a glance of infinite tenderness\nwhich he did not see; as he raised hi3\neyes she veiled hers . with her heavy\nlids. "Why?" she asked again, feignr\nIng that she did not understand.\n"Because," he answered slowly,\n"when a man tells a woman what I\nhave told you, it means something\nmore than. words. And yet well, Al\nice, dear, I couldn\'t tell you of what\nshould have kept my tongue in leash."\n"You\'d better tell me, dear," she an\nswered, slipping her arm through his.\n"Come,- let us walk slowly up and\ndown the deck, and you shall tell me\neverything and I will listen and not\nsay one word until you have ended."\n"You know I love you?" he began,\nas they walked slowly under the\nstars. "Yes, there was never any pre\ntense between us. And our love should\nnaturally end in marriage. Well I\nam already married!"\nAgain she glanced at him in that\ncompassionate way, but though he\nwaited for her to shrink back from\nhim she showed by no gesture that\nshe felt the blow; she did not even\nwithdraw her arm, but they continued\npacing the deck together. \' \'\n"Let me tell you briefly the story of\nmy life," he said. "When I was ten\nyears younger I quarreled with my fa\nther. My elder brother was alive\nthen; I had no hope or thought of suc\nceeding to the title. I was sent to\nColorado to a ranch. I was twenty\nthree, impressionable, hopeless for the\nfuture, and very lonely. Old Aaron\nHopper, the ranchman who had under\ntaken my education in return for fif\nteen hundred dollars, had a daughter,\na mere slip of a girl, good, sweet, pret\nty, and charming, but hopelessly il\nliterate. She was entirely ignorant of\ncivilized ways; ate peas with a knife,\nas she had always seen her father do,\nand sang sentimental ballads to hi3\naccompaniment on his concertina,\n"Eva had refused me for a long\ntime. In spite of her ignorance, she\nhad an unusual refinement of mind\nand soul. She knew that I could -never\nIntroduce her to my folks at home,\nIf ever I went back. It was not that I\nwould have been ashamed of her but\nit would have been Impossible for her.\n"The day before our marriage I re\nceived a letter from England. My fa\nther and brother were dead; both had\nbeen killed Instantly in a train wreck.\nI was heir to the title and the family\nestates and fortune. In my elation I\ntold Eva-\n"I shall never forget the scene that\noccurred. How she refused to marry\nme, how her. old father, discovered\nthe cause and threatened her, plead\ned with her, implored her. He was\nnot avaricious, he would never have\nleft his ranch; but he felt that his girl\nwas. good enough \'for any man. In\nthe end we overcame her opposition.\nWe were married the next morning,\nand Eva cried all through the cere\nmony. "There was to be no honeymoon. It\nwas haying time, and after the mar\nriage I went ofT to work as usual,\nleaving Eva to keep house in the little\ncottage old Aaron had built at the\nhead of the valley. That night, when\nI came home, Aaron stood at the door,\nwaving a letter, frantic with rage and\nhumiliation. Eva had run away. She\nwould never come back, she Eaid,\nwould never acknowledge the mar\nriage; I was to be free. She had timed\nher movements so as to catch the\nnight train east. It was just the fool\nish act of an ignorant girl. She may\nhave had a hundred dollars saved. I\ndon\'t know what became of her. De\ntectives failed to find her. Old Aaron\ndied cursing her and asking my for\ngiveness for having ruined my life."\n"You did not want a divorce?" asked\nthe woman softly.\n"No. How could I? I knew that\nthe brave little spirit that had given\nitself into my keeping was mine al\nways; that I was morally responsible\nfor her; if ever she appeared I should\nhave taken her home and asked no\nquestions. I kept the detectives at\nwork for years. And lately I have\nfelt that I must do something more\nearnest to find Eva. So I am going\nout to Colorado, to the old ranch, if\nit is still there, and I shall try to dis\ncover whether she has not come back.\nPerhaps I have hoped It the early\nmemories will draw her home again."\n. He ceased and the woman withdrew\nher hand and placed it -on Lord Al\nwyn\'s shoulder.\n"Stop,, dear!" she said. "Now look\nat me. I want to ask you a question.\nDo you love her as much as you love\nme?"\nLord Alwyn laughed rather bitterly.\n"I don\'t love her at all," he Eaid.\n"And how much I love you you know.\nBut, my dear, because I do not love\nher I feel my duty the more strongly.\nSo I am going to try to find her and\nso "\n"Good-bye," she whispered, and rais\ned her lips to his. For a moment they\nclung to each other with all the\nstrength and passion of two who know\nthat thence forward their lives must\nbe sundered forever. Then she, was\ngone and he was alone in the star\nlight and with his sorrow.\nLord Alwyn spent three days In\nNew York. He called on his detec\ntive agency, but they had learned\nnothing. Then he took the train for\nColorado.\nIt had changed hardly at all during\nten years, that wild, mountainous\ncountry. When he stepped out at the\ndepot he found the same little station\nand the same station master, though\nthe man did not recognize in him the\nboy whom he had speeded heartily on\nhis way home a decade previously.\nLord Alwyn hired a rig and drove the\nten miles to old Aaron\'s ranch. The\nroad was still deserted, still bordered\nby barren plains whereon no crops\ngrew. It was not until he reached\nthe ranch that he came upon signs of\ncultivation. Then his heart leaped..\nThe little house still stood in its loca\ntion, and smoke was issuing from the\nchimney.\nBut it could not be she! No doubt\nthe place was leased. That account\ned for the cultivated fields for the\ngirl would never have come back to\nmanage the farm alone. Alwyn drew\nrein at the door, hitched hi3 horse to\nthe old post, and knocked. A woman\nopened it. It was Eva, dressed as a\nrascher\'s daughter, a rake over her\nshoulder, her hands dusty with hay,\nbut Eva matured No, It was not Eva.\nIt was Alice Pasquale!\nLord Alwyn staggered.\' against the\ndoor and his hands, groping feebly,\nfound hers and held them.\n"Do you know me now, dearest?\nshe whispered. "Have you found her\nagain, this Eva, this Ignorant girl?"\n"Alice!" he said, chokingly, "it is\nyou? You are Eva?"\nShe placed her arms round his neck\nand drew his head down to her breast.\n"You couldn\'t have known, dearest,"\nshe whispered. "It was cruel of me to\ntry you so long. How could you have\nrecognized the ignorant farmer\'s girl\nin Alice Pasquale, the singer, the Ital\nian nobleman\'s adopted daughter? But\nI have waited for you so long, my\ndear!"\n(Copyright, 1913, by W. -G.

Servia. The following\nnarrative was written by a womca.\nwho was the first of her sex to vis.t\nthe Monastery of Zica, near this city.\nShe tells of her experiences in the an\ncient edifice" It follows:\nWe got away from Tschatschak at\ntwo o\'clock for the Monastery of Zica.\npronounced Schltscha, whicn stand?\nhigh amid the mountains, five kilome\nters from Kraljevo. It was built in\n1207 and is the monastery in which\nServian kings are crowned, a special\ndoor being made for each and walled\nup after the ceremony. It was here\nthat King Alexander brenowitsch.\npoor unfortunate, was crowned in\n1S92, and the present King Peter in\n1904.\nTwo hours more of climbing and we\narrived at the Cabana of Studenitza.\nbefore the monastery gates. Inside, to\nour surprise, all was clean and well\nkept the paths, the green turf, the\ntrees laden with fruit- and well eared\nfor, and the beautiful marble church\nitself with its fine doors and dome. We\nwere immediately received by the arch\nimandrite (bishop), the head of the\nmonastery, who seemed most delighted\nto see us and told me I was the first\nstranger woman he had ever received.\nWe were at once taken upstairs into\nthe guest rooms of the convent a long\ncorridor of clean boards, the only clean\nrooms I had seen Eince I left home.\nHere we took the inevitable slatko and\nvery good slivovitz and cabowitz. which,\nis a liquor made from grapes, and\nthen went into the churches the first\nand oldest, a small chapel of the tenth\ncentury, full of old frescoes, in a per\nfect state of preservation except that\nthe Turks shot out the eyes, of the\nsaints when they occupied the con\nvent. There are fourteen or fifteen \'small\nchapels one behind the cathedral\nbuilt by Stepan Urosch, grandson of\nthe holy Simeon, who founded the con\nvent in 1314. The cathedral, of white\nmarble, built in the twelfth cen\ntury, is the most beautiful monument\nof old Servia and well worth the long\njourney to see.

His son, the\nholy Sava, brought his bones from the\nmonastery of Chilender on Mount\nAthos, where he had been buried, and\nwas known by the name of Saint Sim\neon, and they now repose in a much\nlocked metal casket which the archi\nmandrite, with quite unknown amia\nbility unlocked for us. First, he laid\nupon the breast a very holy cross,\nwhich he kisses, and kissed what I sup\npose was the head, for it was covered\nwith an embroidered cloth, and we did I\nlikewise. Then we each laid a contri\nbution In the casket, which, as Stu\ndenitza is very rich, it probably did not\nneed in the least.

Another health campaign\non the Isthmus, such as Colonel Gorgas\nconducted will probably have to be\nundertaken because of the creation of\nswamps by the rising of Gatum lake\nas the work on the spillway dam pro\nceeds. Already from one large swamp\nso formed have come great swarms\nof mosquitos, which have settled over\nthe town of Gatum.\nSo thoroughly was the work of Col\nonel Gorgas one that mosquitos had\nbeen a rarity on the canal zone for six\nyears, and the workers hard come to\nbe oblivious of danger - from that\nsource. So afhen the pests suddenly\ndescended on Gatum there was amaze\nment, followed by a rehearsal of old\ntales of yellow \'fever and malarial\nscourges, which bred not a little fear\namong the workers. .\nInvestigation has shown that these\nmosquitos are not of the yellow fever\nbearing kind, but the malarial type.\nAn outbreak of malaria is feared, but\nthis can be controlled much more eas\nily than yellow fever.

The fact\nis tbat as age advances the stomach\nmuscles become weak and inactive\n-and the liver does not store up the\njuices that are necessary to prompt\ndigestion.\nSome help can be obtained by eat\ning easily digested foods and by\nplenty of exercise, but this latter is\nirksome to most elderly people. One\nthing Is certain, that a state of con\nstipation should always be avoided as\nit is dangerous to life and health. The\nbest plan is to take a mild laxative\nas often as is deemed necessary. But\nwith equal certainty it is suggested\nthat cathartics, purgatives, physics,\nsalts and pills be avoided, as they do\nbut temporary good and are so harsh\nas to be a shock to a delicate system.\nA much better plan, and one that\nthousands of elderly people are follow\ning, Is to take a gentle laxative-tonic\nlike Dr. Caldwell\'s Syrup Pepsin,\nwhich acts as nearly like nature as is\npossible. In fact, the tendency of this\nremedy is to strengthen the stomach\nand bowel muscles and so train them\nto act naturally again, when medicines\nof all kinds can usually be dispensed\nwith.
