NUMBER 43.\nBEMIDJ I BUTTE\nMAKE S GOO TES\nStandi High Among 320 Entries of\nthe Six Months Educational Con-\ntest215 Score SO.\nCREAMERY HAS SURPLUS STOCK\nChurn About 1,300 Poundi a Week\nFarmers Bringing In More Cream\nEvery Day.\nDOES YOU COW MAKE GOOD?\nProper Feeding Hat Much to Do With\nthe Ability of An Animal to\nEarn its living.\nAt a meeting of the directors of the\nBemidji Creamery association held\nin the creamery Monday afternoon\nmatters were discussed regarding the\ndisposition of the surplus butter stock.\nE. C. Stiles, butter maker will make\na trip to International Falls Wednes\nday and he is of the opinion that this\ncity will take care of all surplus\nstock. Bemidji butter tests with the\nbest butter made in this section of the\ncountry. It was entered in the six\nmonths education contest instituted\nby the state dairy and food commis\nsion and scored 90%. There were 320\nentries and 215 scored ninety, while\n105 did not reach that mark.\nThe farmers are becoming fast\nfriends of the local institution and\nare becoming aware of the advantages\nof bringing their cream to this mar\nket. The creamery churns about 1,300\npounds of butter each week, most of\nwhich is being disposed of locally.\nMr. Stiles said today:\n"Too many farmers throughout the\ncountry do not know exactly what\ntheir cows are earning them ,and the\nfaster they learn that the cow does\nor does not earn its board,.the belter.\nbenefit:\nIn an address, Professor Hugh G.\nVan Pelt, of Waterloo, Iowa, said,\n"In too many instances, the pro\nducer of milk and butter fat has\noverlooked the importance of reduc\ning his operations to a strictly busi\nness basis. This is demonstrated by\nthe fact that so often he refuses to\napply busines principle and even\nholds them up to scorn as being theo\nretical, scientific and impractical. He\nhas refused fundamentals which have\nmade millionaires and leaders of men\nin other lines of industry. The truth\nof this is evidenced by the fact that\nof the millions of cows now being\nmilked in the United States only one\nout of three on the average returns\na profit. Therefore, in dealing with\nthis subject of feeding cows for great\nand economical results, if I can make\nimpressive the fact that real success\ndepends upon reducing the feeding of\ncows to a basis governed by the in\ntelligent and thoughtful application\nof business detail, your time will not\nhave been wasted.\nAs a matter of fact, the farms of\nthe United States are her greatest fac\ntories. Every cow is kept there as a\nmachine of cerain capacity and effic\niency, for the purpose of converting\nraw materialsthe grains and\ngrasses which grow in the fields\nIntoa finished commodity of com\nmerce. The value of each machine\nshould be measured by the amount of\nfeed she can consume and convey pro\nfitally into milk and butter fat. To\ndetermine this point it is necessary\nfor the dairyman to weigh and test\nthe milk at intervals sufficiently close\nto determine the relative merits of\nindividuals from the production\nstandpoint, and determining the\namount and cost of feed she con\nsumes, he is prepared to say which\nis the profitable" cow and which is the\nloafer, provided he has given the an\nimals the opportunity for producing\ntheir maximum yeild. The fact that\ntwo-thirds of the cows being milked\nare unprofitable, does not indicate\nthat these cows are all poor individ\nuals and so poorly bred as to be un\nable to yield a profit. Proper feeding\nalone would suffice to make profitable\nat least half of the cows that are now\nshowing a loss."\nDoctors at Medical Convention.\nDr. E. A. Henderson will leave to\nnight for the cities where he will at\ntend the National Medical convention\nto be held,there. The following doc\ntors have already left. Dr. R. Gilmore,\nSunday night Drs.

"Purity Sun\nday" has been designated by the sev\nenth international Purity congress\nwhich will convene in Minneapolis\nNoveber 7 and continue through No\nvember 12.\nThe convention, which is expected\nto be the greatest gathering the\nworld has yet known in the interests\nof the suppression of white slavery\nand public vice, will be held under\nthe auspices of the World\'s Purity\nFederation. Its purpose, besides com\nbating the white slave traffic, will be\nto promote "high and single standards\nof morals for both men and women,\nthe safe and sane instruction of youth\nin sex hygiene, and in furthering\nsuch social, civic, economic and moral\nreforms as will conserve the very\nhighest in character and life." The\nslogan of the federation in its fight\nto achieve its object will be "Fullest\npublicity concerning the shame of\nthe cities." According to plans\nmapped out today by the local com\nmittee, "a spade will be called a\nspade" in all the addresses and dis\ncussions, and data and statistics re\ngarding the social evil and the white\nslave traffic in every city of size in\nthe world will be presented in fullest\ndetail.\nAnnouncement was made today\nthat President Wilson, former Pres\nident Taft, governors of a score of\nstates, mayors of two score cities and\nofficials of a hundred or more civic\nand sociological ucganizations\nr$tdy hav%7^ent ^teTBt praisinjr $fe&|EIeientlL\nwork of the Federation and intimate\nrag that they will appoint delegates\nor attend themselves.\nAmple opportunity will be given at\nmorning sessions, and following ad\ndresses ,for open discussions in which\ndelegates will be permitted to parti\ncipate.\nB.

Bids were\nopened for storm sewers which are\nto be installed in the blocks which*\nare to be paved during the next two\nweeks. Louis Eckstrum was awarded\nthe bid over Herb Doran, there being\nonly two bids presented.\nWater pipes and sewerage will also\nbe laid on Bemidji avenue before the\npaving as that block isentirely with\nout water at the present time. Al\nthough this may delay the paving for\nseveral days it will be much more\nconvenient to do the work now than\nafter the cement is laid.\nCity Engineer Swinson was also\ninstructed to furnish the council an\nestimate of the cost of grading streets\nbetween Mississippi and Irvine ave\nnues but it is-probable that this work\nwill be delayed for some time as the\nfunds for this purpose are extremely\nlow.\nTwo petitions were presented by\nresidents on Bemidji and Beltrami\navenue asking the council for sani\ntary sewerage On these avenues above\nstreet,TBOth petitionsjwere\nersnteS^s^i"bids^Vifi^be advertised\nfor to complete this Week.\nA cigarette license was. granted to\nGeorge Abrahamson, who runs a\nsmall confectionery store on Third\nstreet.

The patrolmen are covering\ntneir territory carefully during, this\nspell and I do not believe that we will\nhave any trouble from forest fires."\nSTATE SBOUUJfi IEJPR0UD\nSays Alvah Eastman in Compliment\nConcerning Bemidji*-WIlI Tell\nof Surrounding Country.\nMETROPOLIS OF TnTg SECTION\nOn the editorial page of last eve\nning\'s edition of the St/.Clpud Journ\nal-Press, appears" an editorial writ\nten by the editor, Alvah Eastman, for\nyears one of Minnesota\'s -leading\nnewspaper men, concerning the edi\ntors outing held here, \'l- -**_--\nHe refers to Bemidji "as a"city of\nwihich the entire state should feel\nproud of and will in the course of a\nfew days give a more extended notice\nof-btfr city and\nthfe.\ncountry sur\nrounding it.

Small dealers make\nup the largest pjirt of these. In al\nmost every community one or more go\non the list. Sometimes they have in\nvested their last cent -in an undertak\ning, with nothing in reserve for an\nemergency. They soon find themselves\nhopelessly involved, with debts con\nstantly creeping up around them, until\nthe pressure of creditors is so great\nthat they can no longer sustain it, and\nbankruptcy is the result.\nThe wajlbs of thoughtlessness is fail\nure. Go into business with your eyes\nfully open and know what you are\ndoing. If you have $500 to $1,000 or\nmore to Invest in a local enterprise\nkeep out at least 25 per cent as a re\nserve fund. This will help to tide you\nover any difficulties which may arise.\nWhen you start in a small way and\noverburden yourself by accepting too\ngreat a credit from some wholesaler on\nthe capital invested you at once invite\ndifficulties. Unless you have a remark\nable run of business when you first\nopen up your heavy obligation to the\nwholesaler will come due and you will\nfind yourself entangled.\nAt once you will try to borrow money\nto protect yourself, but this is hard to\nget If you are indebted to the whole\nsaler for the amount of all the goods\nin your store. -v\nOne of the chief causes of failure is\nthe lack of ideas by which to make\nyour business attractive to customers.\nAdvertising in the right way and at\nthe right time is the best means of\nstirring up trade. Several years ago a\nman who had learned the grocery\nbusiness in a large city went back to\nhis home town and started in a small\nway. He was a willing, hard worker,\nbut through lack of ingenuity and\ninitiative he had to close his place,\nlosing the money he had invested.\nTwo years ago, with a resourceful\nsilent partner, he ajj\'ain went into busi\nness in the same town. This time,\nwith the assistance of his partner, the\nbusiness was given life and made to\nlive and expnud. The partner at once\ninserted an advertisement in the local\npaper which read: "Our homemade\npies are good enough for Mayor John.\nAren\'t they good enough for you?\'\'\nThe personality entered into in this ad\nvertisement at once focused attention\nto it. The mayor was running for re\nelection at the time, and the advertise\nment helped him also.\nThis was only the starter. Others\neven more original were brought be\nfore the people through the medium of\nthe local paper and at once caught and\nheld the attention of all. Day after\nday new features were tried. Their\nmethods-teemed with life. They show\ned clear mental vision and an insight\nInto human nature. The advertise\nments offered the things that people\nneeded.\nLast year the town had a cleanup\nweek.

It\nappears on the teats or sometimes on\nthe udder, and is most commonly car\nried from one cow to "another by the\nmilker\'s hands. Infected cows should\nalways be milked last and the milk\ner\'s hands thoroughly washed with\nsoap and warm water, and then dis\ninfected.\nAfter infection there is a variable\ninterval of from tw to perhaps seven\ndays before any symptoms appear,\nthen there is heat, tenderness, with a\ntrifling disturbance of the general\nhealth and decrease in the quantity\nand quality of milk. The affected\nteats become a little swollen and ten*,\nder, particularly near the top. Small\npimples appear, varying in size up to\nthat of a garden pea. The color varies\nconsiderably with the color and con\ndition of the skinbluish white, red\ndish, or even dull cream color being\ncommon. The small swellings dip\nsomewhat in the center. They ma\nture about the tenth day. The con\ntents of the pimple or visicle gradu\nally become thicker and the little\nlump dries up into a dark crust\nwhich falls off in four or five days\nand leaves a little scar. Most cases\nof cow pox recover promptly in\nabout twenty days,\nTreatment in mild cases is usually\nunnecessary. In other cases it may\nbe advisable to apply carbolized vas\neline to the sores twice a day. Nev\ner use a milk tube if it can be avoid\ned.M. H. Reynolds, Veterinarian,\nUniversity Farm, St. Paul.\nKt-A a wa\nTake Plenty of Time to Eat.\nThere is a saying that "rapid eat\ning is slow suicide." If you have\nformed the habit of eating too rapidly\nyou are most likely suffering from in\ndigestion or constipation, which will\nresult eventually in serious illness\nunless corrected. Digestion begins in\nthe mouth. Food should be thorough\nly masticated and insalivated. Then\nwhen you have a fullness of the stom\nach or feel dull and stupid after eat\ning, take one of Chamberlain\'s Tab\nlets. Many severe cases of stomach\ntrouble and constipation have been\ncured by the use of these tablets.\nThey are easy to take and most agree\nable in effect.

Thus the Bastile became the\nterror of the people of France.\nOn this fair morning In July, 1789,\nrumors of attack by the royal troops\nhad set the people wild, and armed\nwith every sort of weapon they\nmarched upon the impregnable prison:\nThe garrison within could see them\napproach, take aim at the loopholes,\nand fire. One of the garrisonwas kill\ned but when the soldiers fired the\nmob fell like grain before the scythe.\nSome of the soldiers, sick at seeing\ntheir countrymen murdered, called\nupon the" governor to surrender. The\nlatter, realizing that his cruelty had\nmade him hated by the people, deter\nmined to die but to take the mob into\neternity with him. Seizing a torch he\nrushed into the powder magazine. He\nwas caught ni.time by the soldiers,\nand with a musket at his head ord\nered the drawbridge lowered.\nThen was let loose the hatred that\nhad been growing in the people\'s\nhearts for centuries. The garrison was\nslaughtered and the prisoners freed.\nBut nothing would do less than the\ndestruction of the place itself, and for\na whole year an army of men and wo\nmen and children toiled upon the\nshrinking walls of this symbol of de\nspotic Power. It was leveled to\nthe ground,- and now only a line of\nwhite stones in the pavement shows\nwhere it stood. This open space is\ncalled the Place de la Bastille. In its\ncenter is a fine shaft 154 feet high,\nthe "Column of July", built to com\nmemorate the heroes of the Revolu\ntion of 1830.

So far as can be learned\nthe materials from which beer was\nthen made were substantially the\nsame as today. Beer appeared in\nGreece several centuries before the\nChristian era and was probably much\nthe same in character as that brewed\nby the Egyptians the Greeks, in all\nlikelihood, acquiring a knowledge of\nits manufacture through commerce\nwith that land.

WOODS, Dean, De- .f.\ni- partment of Agriculture, Uni\nversity Farm, St. Paul. fr\nh\nThe accumulation of noxious weeds,\ndiseases, and insects on the farm is\none of the most serious sources of\nloss. This results as a rule from the\nconstant growth or too long continued\nculture of the same crop or class of\ncrops on the same land. Wilt in vari\nous crops, bacterial diseases, grain\nrusts, and weeds and insects too\nnumerous to mention all accumulate\nin the soil under the one-crop system.\nThese pests often multiply to such\nan extent that ultimately it becomes\nimpossible to secure profitable returns\nfrom land thus infested. Resistant\nvarities must then be secured or crops\ncultivated on land not subjected to\nthese pests. All these troubles can\nbe avoided and the fertility of the soil\ngreatly improved by intelligent sys\ntems of rotation. The most profitable\nsystems for any locality or type ot\nfarming, so far as they have been de\nveloped, can usually be obtained from\nthe State Experiment Station or from\nthe Department of Agriculture, "Wash\nington, D.

C. i^zjti\ntmmma\nmmmmmmmm\nWOODROW WILSON UNO THE SNORT BALLOT\nII. Bow Wilson Organized the Short Ballot Movement\nUp to 1910 Mr. Wilson\'s doctrine of simplified, re\nsponsible government had only been extensively dis\ncussed in Intellectual circles. Every serious writer on\nAmerican government sooner or later had deplored the\npractice of electing a multitude of officers. But none\nof them had suggested any constructive remedies. No\nattempt.had been made to convince the great American\npublic of their folly the people were considered hope\nlesBly wedded to the noties. that electing a multitude ol\nofficers is the very essence of democracy.\nIn July, 1909, an article by Richard S. Childs had ap\npeared in one of the weekly magazines in which the evils\nof the elective system and the obvious remedy was discussed under the title o!\n"The Short Ballot" This supplied the necessary catch-word which is always\nnecessary to make an idea "go," in the popular sense. Later on, the author,\nwith Mr. Wilson and several well known editors, called a Short Ballot Con-\nference which banqueted at the Hotel Astor in New York city on January 21,\n1910.\nAt this meeting Mr. Wilson explained that the object of the organlzatiot\nwas to gain the adherence of as ma$y men of influence as possible, of what\never party, and to interest those actually in charge of administration, so that\nthey might aid by their practical knowledge of affairs and their influence with\nthe legislating bodies. "Above all," he said, "we should seek to make the prin-\nciples we have in mind the subject of constant discussion. It is not a cam-\npaign of education we have in mind, but a campaign of information."\nOn the problem itself he said in part:"The methods by which we have\nsought to establish popular control really destroy it. We have sought to make\nevery office, great and small, elective. We have defined the duties and powers\nof each office by statute and we have nowhere united the offices thus set up in\nany coherent, interdependent system. Each officer has derived his authority\nfrom particular legislation and his office directly from the people. He has,\ntherefore, been in no legal sense subordinate to any other officer, has owed\nobedience to no one except those who elected him, has been obliged to co-\noperate with no one except those with whom the statute upon which he stood\ncommanded him to co-operate. It has been a system of executive action laid\napart in complete analysis, and each item of the analyzed structure made\nindependent of the rest If the great multitude of minor and petty\noffices were taken out of the elective list and were transformed into appointive\noffices, if the people were called upon to choose only those who ought under\nany reasonable system to be in responsible charge of the administration of\ngovernment, many interesting results would follow. In the first place, it\nwould be a most desirable and businesslike reorganization of the govern-\nment itself, because it would give it administrative cohesion and a systematic\nrelation of parts, unity and efficiency. What is much more important, it\nwould be the re-establishment of popular control, because it would make it\npossible for the people to exercise a direct and intelligent control over the\nnomination and election of the central authoritative officers."\nThe immediate outcome of this occasion was the founding of the Short\nBallot Organization, of which Mr. Wilson was elected, and remains, president.\nIt was he who drew up the vital section in its constitution and its platform.\nThe campaign for simplified government to which Mr. Wilson has lent the aid\nof his great personal prestige will be treated of in the next article.\nMANY STATES MOVE TOWARD 3HORT BALLOT.\nIn the lower house of the North Dakota Legislature, Representative Snyder\nhas introduced a measure which would apply the Short Ballot to the State\ngovernment. By the provisions of this, the Governor\'s term of office would be\nextended from two to four years, and he would have the appointment of a\nSecretary of State, Auditor, Treasurer, Superintendent of Public Instruction,\nCommissioner of Insurance, three Commissioners of Railroads, and Attorney\nPinfl-nnft ftommiaaioner o* Agriculture .tid iMhnr.\nThe Spirit of Later-Day\nAdvertising\nAs we have said before, the pur\npose of The Pioneer is first of all\nto serve its readers. To do this\nis not only the right moral atti\ntude toward our constituency but\nit is good business, speaking from\na purely business standpoint.\nAnd so it is that we point out\nfrom day to day the advertising\nfeatures of this paper and the ad\nvantages to be gained from keep\ning posted in all of the news thus\npresented.\nThe spirit of advertising is dif\nferent today from that of a few\nyears ago. The idea no longer is\nto fool and to misrepresent, but\nto conform and to invite. And it\nis the constant aim of the good\nmerchant to stick resolutely to\nfacts.\nIt is this spirit on the part of\nadvertisers that makes for confi\ndence and enables us to direct the\nattention of our readers to the\nprofitable practice of "ad" reading,\nfeeling that in so doing we rend\ner them a distinct service.\nInsects cause us an estimated loss\nof $700,000,000~a year in agricultural\nproducts now. A long study of the\nfood of birds shows that this loss\nwould be much greater were it not\nfor our feathered friends, and that\neven the hawk and owl spend most\nof their time in pursuit of insects,\nmice and other injurious animals.\nThe stomach of one bird examined\ncontained 1,900 small insects of a\nkind- very destructive to fruit trees.\nThese and hundreds of other inter\nesting facts are stated in this bul\nletin,, but the most striking feature\nis the liberal use of pictures in color\nwhich make it appeal to all children\nand bird lovers from six to sixty.\nTO CAN PIEPLANT.\nBest Method Is to Cook It In. Mod\nerately Hot Oven.\nWash and cut tender young pie\nplant into half-inch lengths. Select a\ngranite pan of the desired size, put a\nlayer of the pieplant in the bottom,\ncover with sugar, add another layer\nof pieplant, another of sugar, and con\ntinue in this manner until all is in,\nhaving sugar on top. Put in a moder\nate oven and bake until the pieplant\nis tender. Put into sterile jars and\nseal. Use pieplant and sugar in the\nproportion of one cup of sugar to one\nand one-half quarts of the pieplant.\nDo not stir the material, as stirring\nbreaks the pieces of pieplant and gives\nIt a mussy appearance.\nPieplant canned in this manner is\nmuch superior to that cooked on\ntoptrying\nof stove.Mary L.

He has been doing grand work this\nseason and ?:nises to be one of the leading twirlers of the American league.\nS5T?\nbatsman 1 ever\nhave faced during\nmore than twelve\nyears of service in\nthe National\nleague. In fact, I\nlong ago came to\nregard him as my\nbatting hoodoo be\ncause Joe always\nhas been a leading\nfactor in the de\nfeats handed me\nby the Chicago\nclub. The season\nI 4\nof 1908 was a great one for Tinker,\nboth before and after that memorable\npennant fight which went right up to\nthe last ditch. Joe and I have been\nhaving some lively brushes, with each\nto outguess the other. Prob\nably the most bitter pill ever given\nme by Tinker was administered on the\nold polo grounds, New York, one aft\nernoon late in the season of 1908.\nNew York, Chicago and Pittsburgh\nwere fighting it out in see-saw fashion\nfor the pennant, and Brown, an old\nrival, was pitching against me. The\neyes of fandom all over the country:\ncentered about the result of the race^\nwhich had narrowed down to the real\ncrisis. Neither side had pushed a run\nover the plate in seven innings, and\nnaturally the great crowd gathered\nabout-the yard was wrought up to a\nhigh Btate of nervousness. In the midst\nof one of these general brainstorms\nTinker laid hold of the ball, drilling a\nliner high and far away to left cen\nter, the ball crashing against the cor\nner of the fence. Cap in hand, the\nCub shortstop whizzed around the\npathway, digging at top, speed for a\nhomer. That run was the only one\nscored in the battle, and incidentally\nthe beating this accorded me practi\ncally blasted every prospect we had\nfor winning the National league cham\npionship. At first Tinker had a weak\nness against low curve balls cutting\nthe outside corner of the plate, but it\ndidn\'t take him long to remedy this\nfault One afternoon after he had\nr:-\nHe set about to cultivated new "style-f the college teanjA^attmg^with .an\naverage* of. :|06%f^gamef,. and he\nis second in fieWfefe.^\nWhen first\nknew Joe he wielded a long bat and\n*&*-\n*,*%&<$\nJoe Tinker.\nchoked it as he stood close-up to the\nplate. Now he swings with one of the\nShortest sticks In the big leagues. One\nof the best things Joe does against\nmy pitching Is to comb extra-base\ndrives, hence he is duly qualified to\nhold the title of "My Batting Hoodoo."\n,J J--.

Grounds.\nThe dispute between golfers and\n^baseball players as to whether a golf\nball could be driven from the home\nplate at the Polo Grounds in New\nYork over the center field bleachers\nwas decided in tjie affirmative the\nother day. Grantland Rice, golfer and\nbaseball writer, and Oswald Kirkby,\nwidely known amateur golfer, both\nsucceeded .in- making the drive. Rice\nput oyer one ball in four, and Kirkby\ntwo in four. The golfers drove against\nthe wind, but the ball carried over the\ntop of the fence,. which is about 50\nfeet high at this point, by about 15\nfeet. A brassy was .used for the\ndrives, and It Is estimated that the\ncarry "was about 200 yards. The dis\ntance from .the home plate to the\nfence is about 165 yards.
