Perhaps he, too,\nthought of the beautiful Beulah. Un\nder existing circumstances, however,\nhe realized that it would be a tedious\nroad to the winning of that coveted\nprize. He was naturally indolent, self\nsacrifice was painful to his . refined\nnature, and, to express his secret\nphrasing, he "threw up the sponge."\n"It\'s a hard outlook, I\'ll" admit,"\nspoke old Lisle, when he and David\nfound themselves alone. "That bank\nruptcy of Merritt & Co. has about\nswept our coffers clean. The worst\nof It is that it will takd us fully a\nyear to get a new standing with our\nmodern process outfit."\n"But wheiryou do, it\'s clear sail\ning, isn\'t it?" submitted David in his\ncheery, optimistic way.\n"I hope so," and Mr. Lisle went\nover to his desk. He was busy for\nsome time writing rapidly. Finally\nhe arose, proffering David a written\nsheet-\n"Sign that," he directed.\n"Why, what is this?"\n"A deed of copartnership. You\'ve\nshown yourself a true man In agree\ning to see out a forlorn situation.\nWe\'re partners from this on, .friend\nDavid," and the brawny hand of the\nold workman rested tremulously, al\nmost lovingly, on the broad shoulder\nof his loyal assistant. "To have and\nThere Was a Topple and a Crash.\nto hold, share and share alike, the\nbusiness, the equipment, and all In\nand there about."\nAgain David glanced at the portrait.\n"To have and to hold" he smiled,\nwith a quaint- conceit In mind. Ah!\nif only that interest represented the\noriginal, as well as the mere portrait\nof the girl with the wild rose face!\nMr. Lisle\'s eyes were- fixed upon an\nentirely different object. It was a\nlarge, bulging, narrow-mouthed vase.\nIt stood at the top of an old-fashioned\nfile case, where it had rested for\nthirty years.\nHis dead father, William Lisle, had\nmade it. The business of the Lisles\nfor three generations had been bees\nwax bleachers and refiners. WTien\nparaffine came in, William Lisle had\nbeen first in the field. A proud me\nmento of the same was that vase, fash\nioned by his own hand, and resting\nnow where he had placed it to show\nhow staunchly it resisted heat, cold\nand age.\nRather mournfully John Lisle\nviewed the old vase. It had not ful\nfilled its promise. Manufacturers with\nmore capital had outdistanced his\nbusiness. A year since he had at\ntempted an innovation. Everything\nlooked prosperous, but now the house\ndistributing his goods had failed.\nBeulah Lisle did not live at home.\nFor two years she had acted as gov\nerness in a wealthy family. Once a\nmonth, however, she visited her\nfather from Saturday until Monday.\nThose were blissful hours for the old\nman. She mended up his clothes, she\nset his three living rooms in order.\nAnd how they hopefully discussed the\nlittle home they would jointly occupy\nwhen "the new process" wa3 a suc\ncess !\nManfully sharing "all the heaviest\nburdens, David set at work in the new\npartnership. - WTien the Saturday\ncame when Beulah was to make her\nregular visit, he anticipated the pleas\nant Sunday when she would preside\nat table and bring new sunshine into\nthe rather dreary home.\nHe came into the little parlor back\nof the office that especial Saturday,\nto find Beulah there, but in tears, and\nher father looking the picture of de\nspair. Beulah always greeted him\nwith a bright smile, for she knew how\ngood and true he was. The smile was\nlacking now, for deep sorrow shad\nowed her fair face. Still, David fan\ncied that her hand clasp was more\nfervent than ever before, and a mute\ngrafitude in her eyes told that she ap\npreciated his sterling fidelity in sus\ntaining her father amid his business\ntroubles.\n"It never rains bujt it pours," Mr.\nLisle half groaned. "We shall see\nlittle, of Beulah for a long time to\ncome.\'. . - -\n, \'Then Miss Lisle is going L" began\nDavid,, and his . heart stood still\n"going to be married?" he almost\nblurted out.\ni "Going away to another part ; ot\nREL-, I El L I\nthe country, with the Burtons, added\nMr. Lisle.\n"It is best, dear papa," spoke Beu\nlah, soothingly.

And yet can\nimagine what strong chains it would\ntake to hold him fast. So, can you\neven imagine a lion captured with fly\npaper? . Well, not so very long ago,\nfour huge man-eating lions were ta\nken in that manner at the village of\nGwalior, in India.\nIt happened that the head man of\nthe village was able to shut the four\nlions up in a hut into which they had\nventured in search of prey. He kept\nthem thus barricaded for nearly two\nweeks, no one being willing to at\ntempt to capture them. Finally he\nthought of. a scheme that proved as\nsuccessful as it was original.\nHe had thousands of sheets of fly\npaper spread on the ground before the\nentrance to the hut. Then, suddenly,\nthe barricades were lifted and the\nfour lions came bounding out into\nthe fly paper. Of course it stuck to\ntheir paws, and, of course, when they\ntried to lick it off it became stuck fast\nto their faces and heads. The lions\npromptly forgot all about human be\nings and, in their wild endeavors to\nget rid Of the fly paper, rolled over\nand over on the ground, roaring and\nfighting for breath.\nThen the head man and his follow\ners rushed forward with long ropes,\nlassoeed the plunging lions and tied\nthem up fly paper and all!\nOnly Proper Method.\nIt was not without just cause that\nMr. Gladstone\'s name was given to\nthe handy "Gladstone -bag."

In order to ascertain the\ntruth of this matter, the agronomy\ndepartment of the Kansas State Agri\ncultural College has tested fifteen or\nmore varieties grown at Manhattan\nand at Hays, and at one or two other\nsections of the state. Two tests were\nmade of each variety: In the case of\none the blotting papers between which\nthe grain was held was disinfected\nwith formalin in order to keep the\ngrain from molding, because of the\nhigh temperature that prevailed; in\nthe other no formalin was added.\nWhere the formalin was added the\naverage percentage of germination for\nall the varieties was 97.7 per cent, and\nnone of the seeds in this test molded.\nThe germination could be considered\nalmost perfect. In the case of the test\nwithout formalin, where only water\nwas added, the germination was 74.9\nper cent, practically all the wheat\nmolded and weakened its germination.\nThe optimum temperature for the\ngermination of wheat is 75 degrees to\nSO degrees. During the past few\nweeks, the temperature has been\naround 100 degrees to 110 degrees in\ndifferent parts of the state where the\nwheat has been under test for germin\nation. Under such intense heat wheat\nvill not germinate well; it will mold\nbefore germinating. I think that\nwithout doubt those who have tested\ntheir wheat for germination have\nfound it weak or poor, might find an\nexplanation in the fact that the tem\nperature was too great at the time. of\nmaking the test, and unless they dis\ninfected the containers in which the\nvrheat was held, in order to prevent\nmold, this probably materially weak\nened the germination. I am confident\nthat good wholesome wheat, wheat\nthat will test around CO pounds, will be\nfound $rst class for planting in this\nstate if tested for germination under\nnormal conditions. We now have un\nder test for germination a large num\nber of samples which have been re\nceived from farmers in various sections\nof the state, the results of which we\nwill publish within the next few days.\nThe tests we have already made,\ntogether with what we know to be the\nfact concerning the conditions neces\nsary for germinating wheat properly,\nprompts us. to make the statement that\n- Business Men to Buy Seed.\nThrough the recommendations of\nthe farm bureau in Cowley county and\nO. P. Drake, county agent, the Com\nmercial Club3 of Winfield\'and Arkan\nsas City have appropriated $5,000 each\nwith which to buy up quantities of\nseed in that county.

Preparing for an Operation.\n"To qualify for this work a man\nshould spend not less than four y-ars\nin preparation in a standard veterin\nary school. Kansas j-oung men need\nnot go far to get this training. The\nveterinary school at the Kansas Agri\ncultural College is recognized as one\nof the strongest in the United States.\nThe broad training at this school not\nonly enables a graduate to take high\nrank professionally, but he stands\nhigher among the people of his com\nmunity." ALL RIGHT FOR SEED\nthe farmers of Kansas are justified\nin going ahead and planting well\ngraded seed of the past season\'s crop.\nThe agronomy department has on\nhand some 200 bushels of pure seed\nwheat yet for sale in case anyone\nwishes to obtain a small amount fcr\nplanting. This seed germinates al\nmost prefectly.\n" The best time to seed wheat, ac\ncording to a date of seeding test which\nthe experiment station has been con\nducting in many sections of the stalo\nduring the past five years, is between.\nSeptember 20 and October 15. In the\nnorthern and western parts or the\nstate the early seeding, that is, the\nlast two weeks of September, have giv\nen befet results, while as one goes\nsouthward later dates up to October\n15, are best. According to this infor\nmation and our general observations,\nthere is still plenty of time left in which\nto plant wheat under favorable condi\ntions. My advice regarding the plant\ning of wheat would be to wait until\nthe dates above mentioned before\nplanting, unjess rains have recently\noccurred sufficient to enable the farm\ner to put his land into good seed-bed\ncondition.\nSilos Make Feed Cheaper.\nThe silo is now as much a necessity\non every farm in the Central West as\nbarns and feed lots. Live stock must\nbe kept to maintain .soil fertility and\nfurnish a market for crops grown on\nthe farm. Silage enables the farmer\nto feed his stock 50 to 75 per cent\ncheaper than in any other way and al\nmost doubles the live stock capacity\nof the farm. The entire forage crop is\nsaved and made valuable. "Hence by\nstopping wajste of products and fur\nnishing a valuable food at the lowest\ncost, a silo will pay for itself often\ntimes in one year.\nMotor Car for Farm Bureau.

The bodice of an old satin\nfoundation can be treated to a simple\nfichu of the net with a hanging angel\nsleeve, and the skirt hung with\nstraight lengths gathered in slightly\nunder the belt, with an opening at the\nmiddle front that slants off toward the\nback.p\nAt the hem of the gown the net is\nlaid with some fulness around the\nskirt. A charming French gown in\nwhich this idea was elaborated in\nmany ways had a foundation of change\nable mauve and yellow silk, with\nmauve net as a covering, and a cluster\nof wisteria on a long train to catch\ndown some of the drapery. Yellow\nstain with a black covering and a sim\nple rhinestone trimming is also good.\nTHICK, GLOSSY HAIR\nFREE. FROM DANDRUFF\nGirls! Beautify Your Hair!

They are\nalways in fashion and they stand\ncleaning and dyeing so that the life\nof a good feather extends over several\nyears. A handsome pair of plumes is\nshown here.- They are the only trim\nming required on a shape, and it is a\nmistake to use any other with them,\nunless it is a little band and bow of\nribbon about the crown. This will\nserve to conceal the mounting of the\nfeathers.\nAs will be seen in the picture, the\nplumes are mounted at the back of the\nhat, with one falling toward the front\nand the \'other standing almost upright.\nThey are placed back to back.\nBy buying a readymade velvet\nshape the owner of a plume, or of two\nor three, may mount them herself by\ngoing about it in the right way. It is\nusual to first sew the wire stem of\neach plume to a little square or disk\nof buckram. This should be about the\nsize of a half dollar. The stems must\nbe sewed securely to the buckram\nwith a strong linen thread. When the\nneedle is thrust through the buckram\nfirst, leave several inches of the\nthread free. After many stitches are\nmade (holding the plume securely to\nthe buckram), this free end is-used to\ntie with the remainder of the thread.\nThe piece of buckram fastened In\nthis way to the stems of the plumes\nmake it possible to mount them grace\nfully. When sewing the buckram to\nthe shape an end of thread is left free\nBASKETS FOR THE\nHOME-MADE CANDIES\nEASY TO FASHION\nNOW that it has become difficult to\nbuy really good candy without pay\ning an extravagant price, those who\nknow how to make the delicious home\nmade candies can be certain of mak\ning the most palatable of gifts for\nfriends who haven\'t ti-me or ability to\nmake them. It is too early to make\nup candies for the holidays, but one\nmay prepare in advance pretty boxes\nor baskets in which to place them\nwhen they are made.\nSecure at the ten cent store or\nwherever you can find them the bright\nlittle splint baskets, such as are pic\ntured here. Cut and pull out the\nstrand of colored shavings that have\nbeen placed In them for ornament.\nRun in, instead of the 6havings a rib\nbon of the same width.

After the candy has been eat\nen the basket will remain a" pleasant\nreminder to the recipient of the do\nLor\'s delicious, Christmas . gift.\nParaffin e or tissue paper should be\nplaced In them to protect them from\nthe candy.\nThey will serve to many purposes\nlater thread . boxesr handkerchief.\nfor tying. This Is ,.necessary be\ncause plumes sway la the wind and\nwill pull stitches that are not tied,\nloose, and one is liable to lose a\nplume. Whenever a plume Is fastened\nto the hat it should be tied rather\nthan sewed, but several stitches are\nneeded as well as tie tied thread, to\nhold the plume securely.\nDo not make the mistake of drawing\nthe plume tightly against the hat. Let\nit fall naturally. Then, to keep.it in\nposition.tie the thread about the rib\nand then attach it fthe thread), to the\nhat, leaving the thread sumciently,\nlong to give the plume a little play.\nThe whole object is to fasten the\nplume in place, but in such a way as\nto make the fastening unnoticeable.\nIt is a feature of this reason\'s mil\nlinery that a pair of plumes back to\nback, or one curling within the other.\nis mounted at the same point on the\nhat.\nOne or two plumes are seen more\noften than a f.Teat number. For the\nseason demands that the lines of\nshape must be preserved, not lost, by\ntoo abundant trimming.\nWhite plumes clean and dye satis\nfactorily. In buying black plumes, a\ngood quality may be depended on for\nmany seasons\' . wear. But one must\nselect glossy and deep black ones, for\nthe color of these will not grow less\nrich with wear. Very good plumes are\nnot much affected by moisture. If\nthey become damp hold them over the\nstove or a radiator, and shake them\nuntil thoroughly dry.\ni JULIA BOTTOM LEY.\nribbons, laces, gloves all these need\nboxes.

Last summer the Dutch com\npleted the first century of their libera\ntion from the France of Napoleon\nAfter the Battle of Leipzig, in ISIS,\nin which Napoleon was defeated, the\nFrench were driven out of Holland\nand the House of Orange once more\nrecalled to power. In November of\nthat year the prince of Orange, son\nof William V., returned from England\nand was proclaimed William I. of the\nNetherlands. It Is the centenary of\nthis historic event that was commem\norated with manifestations of patriot\nism in the little country of dikes and\ndunes, says the American Review of\nReviews.\nSince the beginning of the twen\ntieth century Holland has come to be\nlooked upon by the world chiefly as\nthe home of that splendid internation\nal tribunal at The Hague\' by the\nagreement of all the civilized powerB\nof the world for the settlement of dis\nputes between nations. The first\nworld peace conference was held in\nthe Dutch capital In 1899 and. the sec\nond in 1907. When the beloved Queen\nWilhelmina, at the age of eighteen,\nascended to the throne of her fathers.\nIn 1898, the reform of Dutch franchise\nlaws had begun. Electoral reform has\nbeen one of the mooted questions in\nDutch parliamentary procedure ever\nsince. \' One of the\' most important\npieces of legislation passed by the\nstates general during recent years\nwas a law (In 1903) making railroad\nstrikes Illegal. Other questions of\ncoast defence, colonies and a new cus\ntoms tariff have engaged public at\ntention during recent years.\nOne of the most appealing and im\nportant events of Dutch history since\nGateway of Historic Harlem.\nthe beginning of the century was the\nmarriage of Wilhelmina to Prince\nHenry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In\n1909 the birth of their first child, the\nlittle Princess Juliana, was received\nwith great popular rejoicing. The\nDutch feel that there Is less to fear\nin the menace of German absorption\nalways a great bugbear to the Neth\nerlanders now that they have an heir\nto the throne. Holland is one of the\ncenters of European civilization and\nprogress, and it cannot fail to be of\ngreat interest and profit to traveling\nAmericans this year to see thi3 very\nmodern little kingdom as it really is.\nThere is probably no country of Eu\nrope in the track of the tourist about\nwhich there is so much misapprehen\nsion as Holland.\nThanks to the genial Washington\nIrving, who, In his \'Knickerbocker\nHistory of New York, was tfie creator\nof the stage Dutchman, there has been\na general impression abroad of Hol\nland as a rather" antiquated, country,\npeopled by a lot of stout folk who\nwear baggy trousers and wooden\nshoes. Many of us, however, have to\nlearn and a great many more to be\nreminded of the fact that so well has\nthe little Dutch nation managed Its\naffairs that In addition to taking care\nof its home government it holds the\nreins over a vast empire of 35,000,000\nOrientals, and at the same time keeps\nabreast of the commercial, industrial,\neducational and artistic world of civih\nization.\nWOMEN IN CLIMBING FEAT\nScale Mt.
