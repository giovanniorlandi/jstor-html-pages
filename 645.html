About eighteen months ago I had grown so much worse that\n1 could not digest a crust of corn bread and could not retain anything\non my stomach. My heart would beat so fast I could not sleep, at\ntimes I would almost draw double with pain in the pit of my stomach.\nI lost twenty-five pounds; in fact, 1 made up my mind that I could not\nlive but a short time, when a friend of mine recommended Kodol\nDyspepsia Cure. 1 consented to try it to please him and I was better in\none day. I now weigh more than I ever did in my life and am in better\nhealth than for many years. Kodol did it. I keep a bottle constantly,\nand write this hoping that humanity will be benefited."\nYours very truly.\nKodol Dyspepsia Cure is the only digestant or combination of\ndigestants that will digest all classes of food.
