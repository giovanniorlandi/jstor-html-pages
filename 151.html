that the Executive com\nposed of the great I Am and sup\nported by the minority of the Leg\nislature should have the full con\ntrol of the affairs of the Territory\nHow very differently Mr Dole\nspoke in 1887 wften he at a mass\nmeeting held in June of that year\nspoke about the rights of the peo\nple He was then a member of the\nLegislature and it is really refresh\ning to remember the following\nwords which fell from his patriotic\nlips He said\nFellow Citizens There are two\nthoughts to which I call your atten\ntion in our constitution First the\nKing conducts his government for\nthe common good The second is\nlike unto it All men are allowed\nto assemble to consult upon the\ncommon good We have a right to\nbe here and we have assembled ac\ncording tg law but we would not\nbe here today if the King had con\nducted the government for the com\nmon good He has not done so I\nam not here to talk about the minis\nters but about the King for he is\nnot conducting the government for\nthe benefit of the people I need\nnot detail the fact of bad govern\nment by the King to you it relates\nto all departments of the adminis\ntration interference with every-\nthing appertaining to government\nhas been his rule and he has sold\nhis sacred Oath of office to the high\nest bidder We remember the last\nsix years during which the rights\nof the people have been trampled\nunder foot the representative\nciple of government has been prac\ntically destroyed and public moneys\nVC\nrecklessly squandered These things\ncannot go on\nMr Cecil Brown who was at the\nmeeting was evidently not an an\nnexationist because he insisted on\nhaving his bones buried under the\nHawaiian flag which will be rather\na difficult although not an uncalled\nfor event at present He stood up\nfor the legislative rights against the\nexecutive and today he stands up\nfpr the executive rights against the\nLegislature Part of his speech de\nlivered on that memorable occasion\nreads as follows\nI am an Hawaiian and was born\nunder the flag and under it my\nbones shall be buried Has there\nbeen good government in the past\nfew years No Has the legisla\ntive right been respected No We\nwant then a new constitution Let\nus then go for a new constitution\nDole Brown Co always forget\nthat the writer of this journal has a 2d\nwonderfully good memory and is\nfcblc at all times to dig up ancient\nhistory when the assinine remarks\nof the great statesmen who now be\nlong to the has been fraternity\nwill be brought to public notice and\nthe taxpayers asked the reasons\nwhy the virtuous men speak and\nact so differently today from the\nprinciples and policy laid clown by\nthem in 1887 The chaplains of the\ntwo houses should be ordered to\nread the remarks of Dole and\nBrown quoted every morning for\nthe delectation of the Legislature\nTHE CHURCH TROUBLE\nWithout there is discipline in a\ngreat church thcchurch will cease\nto exist and it is the duty of every\nBishop or Pastor of a denomination\nto uphold the rules and regulations\nunder which he received his office\nA man who refuses to obey the or\nders of his Bishop as Mr Usborne\nhas done sets a bad example to the\npeople to whom he preaches He\nshows defiance against the authority\nof his church while he exhorts his\naudience to meekly and humbly live\naccording to the edicts of the Great\nMaster and not rebel against the\nauthority of the Lord The people\nwho attend services in St Clements\nChapel may be as good Christians\nas those who attend other churches\nbut they do not worship in the re\nligion in which they were baptised\nand they have as surely withdrawn\nfrom the Anglican Church as have\nthe Greek Catholic Church from the\nPope Mr Usborne has of course\na perfect right to establish himself\na Mohammedan or a Buddhist or\nany other old thing and he can\nbuild chapels wherever he pleases\nas long as his dupes put up the\nmoney But his congregation should\nunderstand that they are not wor\nshiping in a church which is under\nthe patronage of the Defender of\nthe Faith and that they simply say\ntheir prayers and listen to sermons\nin the same manner as many people\ndo in their own home and heart In\nan interview with the Advertiser\nthe Bishop of Honolulu is reported\nas saying\nI do not wish to say anything\nmore said Bishop Willis yesterday\nin an interview I have plainly\nstated my attitude I have nothing\nmore to say and nothing more to do\nI am secure in my position and the\nunpleasant disturbance that has\narisen can in no way affect tne or\nmy church The organization at\nwhose head Mr Usborne is has\nnaught to do with the Anglican\nChurch it was founded outside of\nthe church and under another name\nIt is not a branch of the Anglican\nChurch in any sense of the word\nand it has no recognition as such\nhere or anywhere else absolutely\nno recognition\nAs to the motives of the body\nunder the title of the Episcopal\nChurch at Large I have little to\nsay Their actions speak for them\nselves There is some personal feel\ning in the matter but perhaps more\nambition It was thought by the\nparties who organized that associa\ntion that with annexation I would\nbe displaced and my position filled\nby an American Bishop and from\nsuch appointee they hoped to gain\nfavor It seems to me that their\nmotives are very rlaiii and need no\nexplanation\nWhat will be the ultimate out\ncome Why they will simply have\nto stop lying thats all They will\nsimply have to stop lying Time\nwill surely settle this disturbance\nand when it is settled the Anglican\nChurch and its arrangements will\nbe in no manner affected That is\nall I have to say It is simply a mat\nter of time As to my general po\nsition it is fully stated in the Phila\ndelphia Church Standard of March\nmxuur ZulULdJ\nTBS HOTJ8K OF COMMONS\nThe English Parliament has fron\ntimes immemorial boeu considered\nthe foremost legislative body in tlio\nworld The individual standbi f\nove ry member of that great ww\nbly of lawmaker is and must\nabove reproach The members\nParliament receive no pay but servo\ntheir country from pur patriotism\nand the dignity of the Parliament is\nsomething awfully sacred aud ut\nterly utter dont you know\nAnd jot on March 5 1901 a few\nweeks after tbo death of the Rood\nQuoun of Grout Britain a most\nscandalous scene was enaated in\nParliament and for the first time in\ntbo annals of that ausust body\nwe borrow the term from Senator\nKftlftiiokalaui did policemen enter\nthe floor of the Houto and chucked\nout Irish mctnbsrs wbo declined\nto obey the Speaker a moit exalted\nporsouage and who figuratively\nspeaking spat on the awful diguity\nof the House Tho Irish members\ndidnt say dont touch mo tothe\nSergeant at arms as did Senator\nCecil Brown in our awfully diguifiVd\nParliament tbe other day and if\nthey did the alao\na sacred personage knew his busi\nness Tho scene can hardly be\nimagined and we givq as a ltson\nto our looal Parliament a few ex\ntracta from au Irish journal in\nwhich the soandal ia reported -\nThe Houst throughout the\nevening was discussing the educa\ntion vote of 17301000 in Commit\ntee of Supply Deputy Speaker J\nW Lowther was in the obair The\nNationalists contended that tbo\ngrants to the Catholic schools were\ninsufficient They also opposed tho\nrote on other grounds\nAbout midnight Mr Balfour the\ngovernment leader amid loud pro\ntests from tho Opposition moved\nclosure to which the liot 8 agreed\nby a vote of 220 to 107 Mr Low\nther then put tho vote the Irish\nMembers groaning and shouting\nGag Tho membera began to file\ninto the division lobbies but some\nof the Irish mostly new members\nkept thtiir seats talking loudly\namong themselves and venting their\nindignation\nThe Irish members refuted to go\nto the division lobbies and the chair\nman waited a considerable time aud\nthen requested the members to pro\nceed to the lobby Mr Flaiu\nspeaking for his comrades said\nWd feel it to be our solemn d\nto make a protest against the\nwhich all the Irish votos have L\nclosured It is a scandalous pt\nceediog\nThe chairman replied that it was\nimpossible to gn pack upon the de\ncision of the House The Hour\nhad deoidod that tb question\nshould be put and it was bis duty\nto put it Ha addel that if tbo\nIrish members refused to go into\nthe lobbisa ho mutt send for tho\nMr MoHugbsair You may\nfetch jour policemen but wa will\nnot vote\nThe Speaker was sent for and\nnamed which means ordered to\ngit twelve Irish members who\nhad declined to obey tho Ohair\nTho mombers named refused to\nleave tha Bouse and after an inter\nval tho police were summoned The\nSpeaker appealed to the named\nmumbars to leave quietly Their\ncomrades shoutod Dmt so\nSend for Lord Roberts and similar\nexpressions\nThe House messengors first at\ntempted to remove Mr Crane who\nslippod to the floor and hugged a\nbench The messengers vainly tried\nto lift him His comrados surged\naround him yelling encouragement\naud taunting the messengers when\nthe latter after a hot struggle had\nto admit themselves beaten\nThen at a signal from the ser\ngeant the door of the House was\nopened and about twenty police\nmen appeared advanced to Crane\nand surrounded him He clung to\nthe benches and after desperate\nstruggle was liftod by ten constables\nand dragged struggling from tbe\nobtmber\nThe Irish ropmburs cheered and\ncriod Siia Ouo cried You\nwill lw ean nut of South Africa\nthe rutuf vv
