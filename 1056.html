It is still intolerable\nfor the government to interfere\nwith our individual activities ex\noept when it is necessary to inter\nfere with them in order to free\nthem. But I feel confident that\nif Jefferson were liv:ng in our day\nhe would see what we see: that\nthe individual is caught in a great\noonfused nexus of all sorts of com\nplicated circumstancas, and that\nto let him alone is to leave bim\nhelpless as agaiust the obstacles\nwith whioh be has to contend;\nand that, therefoie, Jaw in onr\nday mast come to the assistance\nof the individual. It must come\nto his assistance to see that he\ngets fair play; that is all, but\nthat is muoh. Without the watch\nful interference, the resolute in\nterfsreno , of the government,\nthere can be no fair play between\nindividuals and such powerful\ninstitutions as the trusts. Free\ndom today is something more than\nbeing let alone. The programme\nof a government must in these\ndays be positive, not negative\nmerely.\nThat is the wealth of America\nand if Amerioa discourages the\nlooality, the community, the self\ncontained town, she will till the\nNation. A nation is as rich as\nher free communities; she is not\nas rioh as her capital city or her\nmetropolis. The amount of money\nin Wall street is no indication of\nthe wealth of the American people.\nThat indication can be found only\nin the fertility of the American\nmind and the productivity of\nAmerican industry everywhere\nthroughout the United States. If\nAmerioa were not rioh and fertile\nthere would be no money m Wall\nstreet, it Americana were not\nvital and able to care for them\nselves, the great money exchangee\nwould break down- The wtlfare.\nthe very existence of the Nation,\nrests at last upon the great mass\nof the people, its prosperity de\npends at last upon the spirit in\nwhich they go about their work in\ntheir several communities through\nout the broad land. Iu propor\ntion as her towns and her country\nsides are happy and hopefal will\nAmerioa realise the high ambi\ntions which have marked her in\nthe eyes of all the world. The\nwelfare, the happiness, the energy\nand the spirit of the meu and\nwomen who do the daily work in\nour mines and factories, on our\nrailroads, in our offices and ports\nof trade, on our farms and on the\nsea, is the underlying necessity of\nall prosperity, There can be\nnothing wholesc me unless their\nlife is wholesome; there can be no\ncontentment unless they are con\ntented, Their physical welfare\naffects the soundness of the whole\nNation.\nStake of Ohio, city of Toledo,\nFrank J.

WATTS IS COLLECTOR.\nThe Pig In the Pgke Seems to Have Wig\ngled Out.\nWashington, June 27—Alston D\nWatts, collector of internal reve\nnue for the western district of\nNorth Carolina, this is the new\ntitle of the popular North Caro\nlinian who represents Iredell\nCounty in the State Senate and\nwho has been acting during this\nsession of Congress as olerk of the\nSenate Finance Committee, of\nwhijh Senator Simmons is ohair\nman. He was nominated and\nconfirmed today.\nl oe nomination 01 watts was\nsent to the Senate this afternoon\nand, contrary to the usnal custom\nof the Senate, was confirmed a few\nminutes later. When the news\nwas telegraphed him at the Fi\nnance Committee room. Mr.\nWatts was incredulous, as the\nnomination had not come in with\nthe first batch of names reoeived\nthis morning from the White\nUouBe, but oame later.\nWhen asked what be had to say,\nMr. Watts replied: “I have no\nhard feelings againBt anybody and\nam very grateful to my friends.”\nSinoe the recommendation of\nWatts was made by Seator Over\nman and concurred in by Sentor\nSimmons a vigorous and relentless\neffort has been made to block his\nnomination. It was reported that\nE. J. Justice, who is considering\nentering the contest for the Uuited\nStates Senate against Senator\nOverman, led this fight. Colonel\nWatts was charged with being a\nreactionary and with having de\nfeated progressive measures in the\nState Legislature.\nAnother effort to blook him\nhinged on his having opposed\nPresident Wilson in the pre-oon\nvention campaign. The enemies\nof Mr. WattB intimated that the\nrecommendation of the two North\nCarolina Senators would be ignor*\nfd and that President Wilson\nwould consnlt with a memlerof\nhis Cabinet about the distribution\nof patronage in the State.\nFrequently iu these dispatches\nyour correspondent has cited inci\ndents which showed that President\nWilson would follow the advice of\nthe two Senators, and strongly in\ntimated that Colonel Watts would\nultimately be named. Today the\nPresident finally reached the oase\nand justified these predictions.\nMr. Watts annonnoes that he\nwill immediately resign from the\nState Legislature. In the event\nthe Legislature is called in extra\nsession, a new eleotion will have\nto be called to fill the vacancy.\nShould there be no extra session\nthis will not be necessary, as he\nhas already served through the\nregular term,\nCnions fir the Editor,\nThe editor is indebted to his\nfriend B. F. Elliott, one of Frank\nlin Township’s hard-working and\nenterprising farmers and one of\nthe best oitiz ms in the oounty,\nfor some fine onions, which he\nbrought him Saturday. They are\nof the Yellow Danvers and Red\nGlobe variety, and are big ones\nand strong ones, something to\nmake a fellow set up and take no\ntioe.

A.\nCampbell, a telegraph operator at\nthe Southern depot. Sunday night,\nfollowing Shemwell’s demand for\na ticket to Asheville on Southern\ntrain No. 35.\nThere were two warrants against\nShemweli this morning, one\ncharging him with oarrying a oon\noealed weapon and the other\ncharging him with an affray with\nCampbell. Campbell was the only\nwitness in the deadly weapon case,\nhe declaring that he saw the pistol\nwhen Shemweli oame under the\nrailing and into the inner oflSoe.\nJudge Oritoher thought that there\nwas some doubt about it and pro\nnounced Shemweli not gniltly. In\nthe affray case Shemweli was\nfound guilty and fined $15 and\ncosts, while Campbell was found\nnot guilty.\nDiogenes Finds i Woman.\nA wealthy man died in BruB\neels, leaving nearly aTl of bia\nfortune to a young woman who\nwae entirely unacquainted with\nhim.\nHe was a very eooentrio man\nand set out, like Diogenes, in\nsearch of an honest maD. His\n“tub” was an omnibus, and his\nlantern a small coin. In the om\nnibus he took his seat near the\nconductor, and always showed\nhimself very obliging, passing up\nthe money of passengers and re*\nturning the orange, but to the\nlatter he always managed to add\na frano or a half franc. Then he\nwould watoh those to whom it\noame. They would oount it oare\nfully; notioe the ex.ra ooin and\ninvariably slip it into their\npockets. No one thought of the\npoor conductor, whose meager\nsalary of three franos a day could\nill spare such a loss.\nBut at last a young woman pass\ned hers bask with:\n“Conductor, you have given me\nhalf a frano too muoh,”\n“Diogenes,” delighted, follow\ned her home, made inquiries, and\nas the answers were satisfactory\nmade his will in her favor, though\nhe never gave her warning that\nher half-frano was going to briDg\nher a million.\nDaniels on the Rod Flag.\nThe flag that symbolizes do\nfeeling of loyalty, no love of coun\ntry, no oall for peace and order,\nbat whioh is anfarled in token of\nantagonism to our guiding princi\nples, has no plaoe on our free soil,\nas Secretary Daniels ringingly de\nclares. Amerioa is still the refuge\nof the oppressed, but the grant of\nasylum does not give immunity to\nhostile demonstrations by an or\nganized conspiracy bent on over\nthrowing the government and the\nflag under whose protecting folds\nthey were privileged to foregather.\nIf we find that we have taken a\na reptile into our bosom, a sense\nof danger should prompt ue to\noast it out. — The Washington\nPost.\nThis applies equally well to Ro\nmanists and others out of harmo\nny with our institutions.\nKid Your Children of Worms\nYou can obange fretful, ill-tem\npered ohildren into healthy, hap\npy youngsters, by ridding them of\nworms.

Deal, a mail carrier,\narmed with a shotgun, stepped oat\njust as the supposed thief was\npassing. He was told to Halt\nagain but failed to do so until he\ncould dodge behind a telephone\npole. There he reached for bis\nhip pocket. About this time J. R.\nBrown, the jeweler, having heard\nMr. Deal calling, rushed on the\nscene with a large Swiss rifle. The\nnoise of the clicking of this was\ntoo much for the man and he sur\nrendered. Deputy Sheriff Kim\nball then placed him under arrest.\nOn searching him nothing was\nfound in the way of a weapon but\na razor. He was taken to Salis\nbury and jailed to await trial.\nLater Mr, Peacock found that\nsome one had entered his kitchen\nand dining room and appropriated\neverything eatable.

Every pre\ntense and 6very exouse possible\nwas taken advantage of and at\ntimes and iu numerous instances\nit looked more like the Sheriff was\naiding and abetting the tigers than\notherwise, and for this good rea\nson The Watchman did not hesi\ntate to oppose his re-election.\nWith this kind of a reoord the\ntables were turned and the tigers\nwho bad grown to believe he was\ntheir friend and proteotor flooked\nto bis side while the prohibition\nistB largely and rightly either vot\ned against him or did not vote at\nall. Daring the first four years\nhis friends, the prohibitionists,\nvoted for him and were sadly die\noouraged, now after the tigers took\nhim op and carried aloft his tat\ntered banner, they are getting it\nin the neck. Beantifnl politics.\nHowever and notwithstanding,\nlet the Sheriff proceed. He is\nnow on the right traok and if he\ncontinues to hew to the line, he\nwill not only redeem himself with\nthe better element of the county,\nbut will even earn the respect of\nthe tiger and the law-breaker of\nevery variety.\nThe Watchman has stood for\nthe principtls involved in prohi\nbition, has not allowed men or\nparties to swerve it one iota from\nits coarse. When one man ap\npeared to desert the oause, The\nWatchman sought another and\nwas glad to support any man of\nwhatever politics, provided he was\nright on this matter. It does not\ntherefore, at this time make a\nohange, but as heretofore, glad\nly bespeaks the hearty support of\nany official who does his duty, bo,\nif Sheriff McKenzie really means\nto enforce the law and ubs the\ningenuity with whioh he is abun\ndantly endowed to that end, The\nWatchman heartily oommends,\nWe are in reoeipt of a hand\nsomely printed and illustrated\nbook of Seattle, Wash , from our\nold friend native of Rowan, C.

Just then, to my mingled relief\nand annoyance, Tom appeared at the\nwindow, too, with a fiendish grin, as\nhe sized up the situation and my cos\ntume.\n“Been serenading you, has she,\nArchie?” he asked affably, while I\nboiled with helpless rage. “You mustn’t\nmind it, old man; it\'s the day we cele\nbrate, jrou know, and our patriotism\nstill runs so high that even the girls\nseek out peaceable English visitors\nand taunt them with our independence.\nQuite the usual thing.” Then, as\n“Archie” and I preserved a helpless\nsilence, Tom sobered down and Intro\nduced us in proper style, and as soon\nas I heard the name I remembered\nthat Archie Vane was Tom’s chum In\nLondon, when he was over there set\nting up some machinery. He had Just\nlanded and Tom, running across him\nin New York the night before, had In\nsisted on his coming home with him\nto spend the Fourth—all natural\nenough when Tom explained it. So\nthere I’d been bearding the British lion\nin his den with militant American\nnoises on the anniversary of a day ig\nnored by all good Englishmen; and\nhere was the British lion looking at\nme with his ingenuous blue eyes as if\nhe was trying to decide whether Td\nbite or not\nl warn you, Tom added, in no\ntactful little way, “that Peggy Is a\nrabidly patriotic person, so I wouldn’t\nadvise you to start any discussions on\ninternational Issues. This Columbia\ngetup Is quite In character, so be\nware!” Alice and the boys came out\n‘on the porch just then and wanted me\nto stay to breakfast; but of course 1\ndeclined with dignity and went home—\nvia the front gate, however. Instead of\nthe garden wall. When I turned to\nlatch it that Englishman was still look\ning at me In a dazed sort of way.\nThe plot thickens.

I’ve said heaps of\nperfectly ferocious things, and I sup\npose I meant every one of them. But\nthat was before Archie— Polly, dear,\ndo you know, he says it was all over\nw\'th him from the first moment he saw\nme—and in that circus-parade rig!\nIsn’t it absurd—and lovely?

Fickel Throw* Two\nSuccessive Shots Straight Into Target\nBridgeport, Conn., was recently the I\n^cene of a most remarkable aeroplane\nachievement. Not only Aid it thrill the I\nvast army of spectators because ci the\nreckless daring displayed by the bird\nmen, but it proved beyond all question\nthat, with the right make of rifle, a\nmarksman can shoot while flying at\nrsmendous speed, with the same ac\nracy as when on the ground.\nArmy officers have been anything but\nsatisfied with the results obtained with\nthe service rifle, and the flight was\nplanned as a test of a repeating arm of\nother than government make.\nThe flight took place at the Lake\nAerodrome before 10,000 people who\npaid admission and a far greater num\nber who occupied points of vantage\nupon neighboring hilltops, housetops\nand trees.\nWhen Beachy came upon the field, a\nviolent wind was blowing. Undeterred,\nhe mounted his seat and was soon\nsoaring high above. More than once\nit seemed to the spectators that his frail\ncraft must surely turn turtle and come\ncrashing to the earth, but every time\nthetreacherouswindthreathened, clever\nmanipulation by the aviator held the\nmachine straight and true. After having\nbeen in the air a number of minutes,\nBeachy pointed his craft in the direction\nof the grandstand, encircled it twice\nand, as gracefully as a bird alights,\nbrought it safely to the ground.\nTo every one present it seemed cer\ntain, in view of the dangerous antics of\nfiha wind, that no more flights would\nbe attempted that afternoon; but to the\namazement of all, Beachy, as soon aa\nhe landed, hailed Lieut. Fickel, who\nwas standing nearby, armed with a\nRemington-UMC rifle, and invited him\nto take a seat alongside.\nThis Lieut. Fickel did, and aviator\nand passenger were soon on their war.\nTo make the trip all the more hazard* j\nous, the machine had been shorn of all J\nextra supports invariably carried with jj\npassengers for balance. £\nTime and again the big planes could I\nbe seen to tremble as If they were about I\nto snap when contrary gusts of wind ■\ncaught them; and to those below tho\ntilting and the swaying of the mono\nplane were fore-runners of certain de\nstruction to the aviator and his pas\nsenger.\nWhen the machine reached tha\nfarther end of the field it suddenly\nturned, and came flying back at light\nning speed. At the other end of the\nfield, in full view of the spectators, a\ntarget had been rigged. When within\nfiring range, Lieut. Fickelraisedhisrifle\nand sent two shots straight to the mark.\nIt was a wonderful performance and\na fitting climax to a meet that was re\nplete with sensational features.\nIn an interview after the demonstra\ntion, Lieut. Fickel said that he found\nthe speed and accuracy of the Auto\nloader a distinct advantage over the\nservice rifles he had previously used in\nsimilar tests, and that he considered It\nthe only practical gijn for use undaa\nsuch conditions.\nSuit Against Statesville for $:5,003 Dam\nages.\nA damage suit instituted by\nNeill Alexander against the city\nof Statesville for $15,000 damages\non account of injuries to his little\nson, Master Harold Alexander,\nwho either fell or was pushed from\na culvert on Bell Street while en\nrouto:home from school, is expect\ned to come up for trial at the next\nterm of Iredell Superior Court.\nThe damages are asked on the\nground that the ohild, who was\nbadly injured, was not prop\nerly protected from the preci\npice from which he fell, there\nhaving been no railing along the\ntop of the oulvert at that time.—\nStatesville Landmark.\nThe Best Hot Weather Tonic\nGROVE’S TASTELESS chill TONIC enriches the\nblood, builds up the whole system and will won\nderfully strengthen and fortify you to withstand\nthe depressing effect of the hot summer. 50c.\nSALISBURY MARKETS.\nCorrected weekly by D.
