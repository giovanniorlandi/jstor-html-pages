On Monday night they\ntook the oath of office and after\n! organizing and appointing the sev\nieral committees adjourned until\nTuesday night. W. A. Hal) whs\nchosen as chairman of the council,\ni At the meeting Tuesday night\nthree ordinances were passed\nnaming the duties aud fixing the\nsalaries of city attorney, chief of\npolice and street commissioner.\nAn sdjonrnment eras then taken\nuntil tomorrow night when the\n! officers for those places will be\nnamed.\n1 Mayor Brown\'s message was\nI read Monday evening and was as\n! follows:\nGentlemen of the Council of\nthe City of Orangeville:\nAt this time and in accordance\nI witb the established custom, it\nliecomes my duty as Mayor of the\nj city of Orangeville to present to\nyou my views concerning the needs\nof the city, and to give such in\nformation as may lie in my power\n1 for your consideration.\nI At the threshold of <>ur existance\njas a city we may congratulate the\n! citizens upon the growth aud de\n. velopement, and improvement they\nhave F m sde M a village during the\n2\' five years it has been iu existence.\nSiWehaveseen the population more\na than doubled: the District school\n* house has given place to our fine\n5 ten room school buildinfi and\n5 graded school with its corps of ten\ne teachers from which the graduates\n5 ! may enter any of ilte colleges or\n2 ; universities of tue northwest with\n2 ! out examination.\n* I The holes in the ground used as\nJ I wells, have been replaced by a\n* \'system of Water Works supplying\nx I yure mountain spring water for\n* j domestic use, and providing water\nfor fire protection and irrigation.\nElectrict lights have taken the\nplace of kerosine oil, materially\n0 reducing the risk of fire and acci\ndents, and lighting our streets as\nwell as our homes.\nMany permanent improvements\n* have been made in our streets; a\n4 system of underground ditching\nand fluming haa made Hall Street\npassable. The filling and flutning\nof East and West Main street, are\ngood and permanent improvements.\nThe removal of the Couuty seat\n* * to Orangeville is the most recent\n* I and one of the most recent and\n( I one of the most important achinve\n(, inents, in its development\nWhile I, as a member >>f the last\nBoard of Village Trustees, was\nnot in full accord with the major\nity iu some particulars, I beleive a\ngreat deal of credit is due them\nfor their careful, painstaking efforts\nto advance the material prosperity\nof the city. With their hearty co\noperation the necessary vote in the\nCounty Seat Election was secured\nand the City Hall and Court House\n1 \' does credit to all who took part iu\n<1 its erection.\nI ) While it is well to review the\n( , past, the work of the present coun\ncil lies in the future. What can\nbe done to further advance the in\n( \' terests of the city, and the citizens\n9 who have chosen us to serve them?\nThe motto of cities as well as\nindividuals should be "Go For\nward" as rapidly as the means at\nyour command will permit. Your\nrecord should not be judged by the\namount of revenue expendee but\nthe manner of expendature, and\nthe results secured. I would rec\nomend rigid economy to the extent\nof getting the greatest possible\nbenefit to tbs city of every dollar of\npublic money expended.\nIn the change from a village to a\ncity some of the old ordinances\nill be found inapplicable to new\nconditions, and should be repealed\nand new ordinances passed.\nPOLICE.\n■\nI\nj\no\nu\nS \'\n>\nwi\nOne of the firat matters claiming\njour attention ia the Police, I will\nsuggest that before appointmente\nare made it is necessary that an\nordinance be passed fixing the\nnumber, their duties and\ncom\nthe\n" The BaJury of the city attorney\nShort. ; also be fixed before the ap\n, pointaient » made. This office iu\ndeal my j udfMnent fc * very important\n\' one, involving matters which re\non.\nattention. I will sugext that it\nemail monthly salary might be fixed\nand that in addition he be allowed\nfees in the Police Court cases, of\nnot to exceed $2.50 each, to be\ntaxed ns costs against the party\nfound guilty of violation of a city\nordinance, as has been the case\nunder the village government, and\nthat in civil cases in the District\ncourt he be paid a fee in each case\ncommeuaurnte with its importance.\nStreet Improvements.\nPerhaps the most serious and\niraportaht question confronting you\niB that of street improvements.\nI would recommend that the Street\nCommittee, with the aid of the\ncity Engineer, procure accurate\nestimates of the cost of paving or\nmacadamizing Main Street, for the\npurpose of submitting the mattet\nto the property owners along that\nstreet for their approval or other\nwise. In my judgement the city\nwill receive sufficient revenue the\npresent year available for that\npurpose to pave the Main street\nat the street crossings where there\nis no abutting property,\nside streets and crossings will de\nmand improvements, and in this\nconnection I would recommend\nthat the street commissioner be\npaid by the day for time actually\nemployed, instead of a fixed month\nly salary as heretofore. Uis duty\nwould also include the collection\nand expenditure of the Road Poll\ntax in the road district.\nI would reccomend the suit of\nW. M. Jack vs. the city be pushed\nto a hearing and decision in the\nSupreme Court as soon as possible.\nFire Department,\nUnfortunately the revenue nt\nyour disposal will not permit of a\npaid fire company, but we are\nfortunate in having among our\ncitizens a number of spirited young\nmen who have formed and main\ntained a volunteer company of\ngreat importance to the city and\nthey are worthy of the highest\nappreciation from all\nzens as well as ever\nthat lies in your power to give\nthem. We realize that this volun\nteer company may be called upon\nto save our city from destruction\nby fire at any moment. It should\nbe the duty of the Chief of Police\nto look after the fire-aparatus, and\nsee that the hose and hose carts\nare properly cared for.\nThe law requires that estimates\nof expenditures and receipts of the\ncity be made and published, and\nau appropriation ordinance passed\nwithin the first three months of the\nfiscal year. This will be one of\nthe first inatterB requiring your\nattention. It is hardly necessary\nfor me to suggest that the public\nbusiness Bhould be conducted on a\nbroad and impartial basis, giving\ndue consideration to each and every\nsection of the city, and uniting as\nfar as possible all of its people in\ntheir efforts to promote its ad\nvancement and growth.\nRespectfully submitted,\nW.

The suggestion\nin regard to paving Main street is\none which will meet with the ap\nproval of property holders along\nthat thoroughfare, and we believe\nthat the assistance of one or more\nproperty owners will be promptly\nforthcoming to aid the street com\nmitte« in their investfgatiöns Of\nthis important subject if such is\nrl n ■ : - „ ,1 ta ...m « ä a ^\ndeeired.

There is an el\nement among our growing popula\ntion which has become regular\nhabitâtes of saloons, and we believe\nthat the best interest, of the en\ntire community will be best served\nby a hard and fast ordinance\nmaking it a misdemeanor for these c\nboys to associate in tbe saloons.\nIn offering this suggestion it is not\nthe desire of the Free Press to pose f\nas a reformer but it is a well\nknown fket that there are a num\nher of boys under 20 years of age\nin this city who are frequently\nseen on the streets at night in an\nintoxicated condition and unless\nchecked in their career of dissipa\ntion are doomed to soon become\nphysicial and moral wreokB.\nIt is gratifying to note the\n_ _, _,___,\nmayors commenta on the good\nwork done bv the retiring board\n• ", J\nbecause it shows a disposition to\n... w .\nlei bygones be bygones, ana this\n.\naction will tend to allay the sec\n,\ntional and other feelings which\n. - , 7 _\nin the past, have been of no bene\n,\nfit to the municipality.
