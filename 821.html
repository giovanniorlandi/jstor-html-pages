Some cf the\neditorial comments strongly favor the proposed change, while others are\nloyal to the golden state. The Inyo Register, however, moBt clearly zoa\nup the situation. That paper says, after publishing the Bonanza\'s editorial\non the subject in full:\n. "Nevada has let this matter rest too long, In our opinion. Irrespective\nof what the inhabitants of the eastern tier of counties may think, JLos\nAngeles and Its influence would never consent to have a state line drawn\nacross the aqueduct\'s course. Forty years ago this change was talked, and\na resolution similar to the one proposed was adopted in Nevada. Whether\nor not any conference with California was held, at least the subject went\nno further. These border counties are little known and not too highly\nappreciated now; at that time they were still less considered. The chance,\nwhatever It was, was frittered away, indifferently. There are signs of the\nbeginning of trans-Sierra interest in us, and of appreciation. The link of a\nstate highway is likely to be forged. Whatever boundaries may be set,\nInyo has been brought closer to southern and western California than it\nused to be. Our trade affiliations will be there, largely. Our pleasuring\nwill turn In that direction, and to the sovereignty of the Golden State wo\nwill owe a now probable good road system that Nevada would never confer.\nIn one contingency, there might be a strong wish for allegiance with Ne\nvada; that would be the success of the movement to divide California. That\nis highly Improbable. Under present conditions, the proposal to move the\nboundary to Sierra summits Is merely wasted language."\nPERENNIAL MINING \'.\nA GOLD, silver or copper mining camp is not something ephemeral\nhere today and nil tomorrow. Bays the Denver Mining Record. If it\nis located In a well mineralized district Its term of existence may run into\nthe centuries, as Is shown, for example, by some of the copper mines of\nEurope, that have been steadily worked for hundreds of years. A number\nof mining camps in the west started to produce metal more than a quarter\nof a century ago and their output now continues undevlatingly heavy, with\nundiminished values. Indeed, in some localities the tonnage and profits\nhave shown a continuous increase. Every sign tends to strengthen the\nbelief that these camps will be in prosperous existence for many years to\ncome, as there appears no likelihood of an exhaustion of the ore supply for\nA vastly extended period. The persistence of pay ore at great depth, as\nillustrated in the mines of Cripple Creek and elsewhere, means even longer\nlife for the camps where deep mining is followed. Cripple Creek has been\nfamous for many years as a marvelous gold producer, yet it has more riches\nin sight today than It ever had before. The Comstock mineB, noted the\nworld over, also exemplify tne benefits that accrue from mining at depth.\nThey have been operating for close to half a century and at the present\ntime are the center of Intense activity, with no indications of abatement\nThey have produced many millions of dollars tb date and will yield many\nmore millions. Certain California mines are conducting exploration work\na mile beneath the surface of the earth and no doubt will sink to sli\'l\nlower levels in following the ore shoots.\nMany persons, who have accorded only casual thoughts to tbg possibili\nties of mining, seem to believe that the entire mining Industry is forever\non the brink of extinction; thut the ore lodes in most cases will become\nexhausted in short order, with consequent disaster to the cities and terri\ntories directly Interested in the success of the mines. People who form\nsuch vague and erroneous conclusions should remember that mining has\nbeen conducted from times antedating the birth of Christ, and extending\nback Into ages when barbarism held sway. Mining is here to stay. It ha\noutlasted dynasties and will be nourishing; centuries hence, playing Its\nnecessary part in financing the world and supplying the needs of humanity.\nThe prosperity and life of the mining camps are built upon one of the most\nancient and profitable Industries ever developed in the history of mankind.\nThe backers of these camps do not appear to be worrying about the future\nto any noticeable degree, but continue to plan new mining work for them\nselves and for others yet unborn.\nHe who hesitates always spel\'s\nwrong.

It may be that this organize\ntion has already taken steps in this matter, but that has not been deter\nmined.

Not only has\nthe British censorship delayed news\ndestined to Italy, the writers Bay, but\nmessages have been repressed with\nout upparent reason, such as extracts\nfrom the published correspondence\non the European crisis and, more re\ncently, the news of the torpedoing ol\nneutral . vessels by German subma\nrines. "When so much has been talked\nabout the enlightenment of neutral\ncountries, "the letter concludes, "it\nseems scarcely logical that the sim\nplest and most direct means of ac\ncomplishing this should be neglected,\neven prevented.
