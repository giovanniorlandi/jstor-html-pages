E. V. Leverett anil the coun, cil committee on light and water, plant are at work on a new schedule, of rates for electric current which, will provide for reduction of possibly, as muc has 2 Oper cent in the present, rates and will become effective im, mediately after the approval by the, council. The reduction will probably, be made contigent upon prompt pay, ment of bills at the superintendent’s, office., The matter has been under consid, eration for some time, but it was not, thought advisable to make any reduc, tion in rates until the indebtedness, incurred when the plant was remod, eled and new machinery installed,, about two years ago. The total cost, of these improvements was between, 512,000 and 515,000 and this has now, all been paid out ol the earnings of, the system, the last note having been, settled within the past week., Supt. Leverett spent Sunday and, .Monday inspecting plants and secur, ing data on rates at the municipally, owned plant at Hope and the plants, of the Arkansas Power Company at, Malvern and Arkadelphia. lie says, the electricity rates at these cities, will average about the same ac Con, way’s old rate, but the rates for wa, ter at Arkadelphia and Hope are al, most double those at Conway. Mr., Leverett says that he gained much in, formation which will be of value of, deciding upon the schedule of rates, at Conway., While the books and income of the, plant indicate that a reduction of 20, per cent may be made in the electric, ity rates without incurring a deficit, in operation, it apparently will leave, but a small margin, and there is dis, position upon the part of some of the, members not to make too radical a, change at once. It is believed that, no new machinery will be needed for, several years, as the plant is equip, ped with double units, either of which, will carry almost 100 per cent more, than the load now handled, but some, members of the council believe it, would be safer to accumulate a sur, plus to be used in case of emergen, cies and to provide for depreciation, of the plunt, rather than allow all the, profits to be paid out in the form of, reduced rates to the consumer., A reduction of 20 per cent will, mean that the average consumer in, private residences, whose bill has, been less than $5 per month, will be, given service at 12 cents instead of, 15 cents per kilowatt hour. Larger, consumers of electric lights would re, ceive service as low as about 8 cents, per kilowatt hour, and the rates to, power consumers would also be, cheaper. It is not planned to make, any reduction at present in the rates, for water, as the plant has just with, in the past year come to be self-sus, taining., TRUSTEE IS REMOVED, FROM SCHOOL BOARD, Little Rock, Jan. 18.—J. L. Con, ner of Woodruff county was yester, day removed by Gov. Hays from mem, bership on the board of trustees of, the Jonesboro agricultural school., This action was taken under the law, which authorizes the governor to re, move for cause, and because “on ac, count of health or otherwise he has, absented himself entirely from the, meetings and has been out of the, state practically all of the time since, his appointment.”, Mr. Conner was appointed April, 11, 1911, to succeed I. C. Leggett, re, signed, for a term ending March 31,, 1917. Governor Hays announced, that no appointment would be made, to fill the vacancy until after a con, ference today with the executive com, mittee today with the executive com, mittee of the State Farmers\' Union,, which is in session here., CLARK GETS POSITION., Little Rock, Jan. 18. — Another, newspaper man has listened to the, siren voice of politics and has entered, the service of the state.

Mr., Hodges has appointed Charles Clark, o fthe Arkadelphia Southern Stand, ard to the vacancy and Mr .Clark, entered upon his duties yesterday., ABUSfOf PUBLICITY, ACT ISCLNSURED, FIRM STM IS TAKEN, BY EDITORS AGAINST EFFORTS, TO BRING THE LAW INTO, DISREPUTE., Little Rock, Jan. 18.—The next two, annual meetings of the Arkansas, Press Association will be held in Tex, arkanu, according to the decision of, the executive committee of the asso, ciation, which held a meeting in Lit, tle Rock Monday afternoon after the, adjournment of the mid-winter meet, ing of the association. Texarkana, had asked for the 1916 meeting at, the Harrison convention last spring,, with the understanding that efforts, would be made to have it a joint ses, sion with the Louisiana and Texas, associations. Both the other state as, sociations had agreed on other meet, ing places a year ahead, consequently, they could not meet with the Arkan, sas association in 1916, but expressed, a desire to do so in 1917. The Ixmis, ianu association will meet in Shreve, port in 1917 and will spend one da.\\, with the Arkansas association if it, meets in Texarkana at the same time., The Texas editors agreed to meet in, Texarkana in 1917., When these facts were pilt before, the editors Monday afternoon, efforts, were made to switch the 1916 meeting, place from Texarkana, but the Tex, arkana editors were, game and insist, ed that they be permitted to enter, tain the association two years The, matter was then left to the executive, committee to decide., /\\s lexarKana nau virtually ueen i, decided upon for 1916, there were no, other invitations before the executive, committee, and they decided to ac, cept the invitation from Texarkana, for the two years., The annual excursion will be held, out from Texarkana on the Cotton, Belt, with possible side trips to Mag, nolia, El Dorado and Huttig., The publicity act was discussed at, length by the association, and specific, instances of apparent abuse by the, editors in certain counties of the, act, were reported. The association, appointed a committee to take up the, matter of these overcharges, and if, necessary to institute suit to see that, the law is not misused. The mem, bers of the association were appar, ently unanimous in their praise for ., the act, and what dissatisfaction has, been found with it was charged to, ignorance. The committee was also, instructed to issue a statement which, will set the workings of the law fair, ly before the people, the association, going on record in condemnation of, any act which might be unfair, or fa-j, vor any class of the people., The constitutional amendment, which would limit the active member- j, ship to those actively engaged in the |, newspaper business, was hardly dis-1, cussed, being referred to a committee;, to be considered with the completere, vision of the constitution. This com, mittee of which ,J. A. Livingston of, Russellville is chairman, will make a, report at the Texarkana meeting in, May, at which time the convention, will either ratify or reject their ef, forts., une or me principal ieaiuren ui (, the day’s work was the adoption of i, of a resolution for a Newspaper j, Week, at which time all newspapers, of the state will issue special editions,, setting forth the resources of Arkan, sas for distribution in other states., V. A. Beeson, Clio Harper and J. A., Livingston were appointed as this, committee., The committee to look after the ed, ucation of the public as to the valu, able features of the publicity act is, composed of Fred Heiskell, E. C., Johnston and J. L. Wadley of Tex, arkana., About 75 members of the associa, tion attended and among them were, many who have not been attending, past conventions. Ten new members, were elected., VAUGHTERADDS* 10, TO EXTRA 5 MILL TAX, R. W. Robins, secretary of the Con, way school board, has received the, following letter from Prof. J. M.

FRY DENOUNCES, ACTION OF UNION, SAYS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, HAS NO POWER TO RE, MOVE HIM., Little Rock, Jan. 18.—Charges pre, ferred last week by the Pope County, Farmers’ Union against President, Charles E. Scott of the Russellville, agricultural school, and J. H. Fry,, secretary of the Arkansas Fanners\', Union ,will be discussed today at a, meeting in Little Rock of the execu, tive committee of the association, Mr., Fry said on his arrival from Atkins, last night. Mr. Fry is not a member, of the executive committee, but ex, pects to meet with it and H. S. Mob, ley of Prairie Grove, president of the, association. Mr. Mobley is expected, early this morning., Mr. Fry vigorously denounced the, resolutions ugainst him and declared, that properly there is no Pope county, union. The executive committee has, no power to remove him, even if the, members desire it, he said. He said, they can only discuss the resolutions., ‘The opposition to me in Pope coun, ty was started from motives outside, the union,” he said. "A small party, nf members, who have caused so much, trouble in the school, undertook to, ruin me. They secured an injunction, against the operation of a gin in, which I and others were interested., All the machinery was not paid for, and the loss of the season\'s business, mused the company to go into the, hands of a receiver. My son and I, are the real losers. The men who, joined the opposition against me did, not lose more than from $5 to $25, each., "The socalled Pope County Union, is not authorized to hold a charter un, der the bylaws of the union, as it has, less than five locals. There are only, 49 members in the county union and, few of them are in good standing., I hey charge that I have no connec, tion with the union because they, claim to have expelled me Irom a local, on account of this gin affair. Under, the constitution they could not expel, a member because of a business mat, ter that had no connection with the, union. I transferred my membership, to the Atkins local, where I now live,, before they claim to have expelled, me. I have receipts that show I am, in good standing in the Atkins local.", BIGELOW SCHOOL IS, DESTROYED BY FIRE, Bigelow, Jan. 18—The Bigelow, school building was destroyed by fire, last night about <i o\'clock. It was a, large frame building and when flames, were found in the roof there was no, hope of saving it. Only the piano, was taken out. The loss is about, $14,000, with insurance of $7,000., School will be carried on in another, building pending rebuilding., I have moved my shoe repair shop, to J. A.

George Washington\'s was $9,, which included his father, too, while a mere policeman cost $17 when, those worthies and many more, in wax, were auctioned in the Eden Musee., \'HOWl, nucH, AM I Bill, FER Tfl\', oU, lien. Kobert E.

Kark is authority, for the statement that the “Horrors, of the Spanish Inquisition" once could, noi De purcnasea ior *za,uuu. let tne wnoie creepy collection, wnicn nas, thrilled more Keokuk and Kaskaskia spines than any other work of art,, went for $50., “Lot 45, General Funston entering Vera Cruz, eight flags and 6cenery,", was bid up to $40. General Funston, it may be remembered, while not as, tall as Washington, is much bigger around. Besides, he was riding a par, ticularly fine horse., Lefty Louis and Gyp the Blood, Dago FYank and Whitey Lewis, once a, fairly high-priced quartet, were bought for $40, which was enough in itself, to mark the passing of the good old days., Siberian exiles are in slack demand. Seventeen of them went for $40., Five pursuing wolves brought $2 each. Another shrewd bargainer bid in a, “Drunken Woman" for $5. He has no intention of reforming her. he said., The spirited "Attack on a Counterfeiters\' Den” is all out of date. Prob, ably $27.50 was all it was worth. But it does seem as if the "Lion Attack, ing a Moving Picture Operator" might have fetched more than $18. A pretty, penny could be turned by setting up this gruesome group in a hall and, letting theatrical managers and “legitimate" actors gloat over it at, say, $1, per gloat., Oyster Bay Has “Spook” That Shoots and Smokes, OYSTER BAY, L. I.—A woman "spook," who dresses all in black, smokes, cigars and shoots a revolver, has Oyster Bay, L. I., in the grip of a bad, scare. She appears only after nightfall and is credited with chasing children, to tneir nomes, rouowing unescorted, women and men, and disappearing,, seemingly into thin air, when pur, sued by a posse of 100 men and the, village police force, Constable John, Thompson., The woman of mystery has been, busy and women and children are, afraid to venture out of their homes., Children playing in the woods that, skirt Northwood, the country home, of Mortimer L. SchifT, were first, chased by the ’•spook.” Their stories, woic mu£ucu at. um.il lean curey or Bayus Hill, an abstemious carpenter,, ran In terror when he saw the woman, attired in deep black and with a, cigar sticking out of her mouth at a rakish angle, walking toward him., As he ran he says he heard a hoarse laugh and the sound of a revolver \', shot and a bullet whistled near his head. His sister-in-law, Mrs. Victor L., Corey, whose husband is also a carpenter, saw the woman, and she says, many others have been terrorized., A posse was formed. Armed with clubs and sticks it patrolled the roads, ir. the neighborhood of Berry hill, which is the favorite haunt of the "spook.”, Half the posse, it is said, remembered pressing engagements elsewhere, when three revolver shots resounded from the depths of the woods, each, accompanied by a hair-raising laugh., One theory is that the "spook" is an escaped male lunatic. Others be, lieve it is simply a practical Joker., ----—, Chinese Colony of Atlanta Is Sorely Puzzled, —, ATLANTA, GA.—Half a hundred members of the Atlanta Chinese colony,, having extricated themselves three years ago from a predicament, now, find themselves in a dilemma. When Dr. Sun Yat Sen took the helm as, president or the new republic he or, dered his loyal subjects on the two, continents to embrace the Christian, religion, to cease embracing their joss, god, and to cut all queues close to the, head., All these things the Atlanta Chi, nese did with an alacrity that had, not always characterized the race;, and as for the joss they had worshiped, so many years, they tore him down, and burned his body to a fine crisp., Atlanta\'s Chinatown took on an en, ouu a uuiuut-j oi i nmamen joined the churches and offered, up their supplications In the regular American way., They even quit the Chinese ceremonial at Chinese funerals It was, customary for a leader to sit on the hoarse and throw small bits of paper, into the wind. These papers had holes in them, ami the Chinese believed, that evil spirits must wriggle through each hole before they could reach the, bod>. hre the last piece had been tosst to windward the corpse was laid, safely away., In other words, these changes from ancient custom came with the re, publican form of government in China and l)r. Sun Vat Sen; and, now that, ^ nan Shi Kai has made the republic look like a last year\'s bird nest, Atlanta, Chinamen want to know if there is any obligation to return to Confucianism,, joss gods and queues., The answer must be recorded in the negative, as far as the rank and, file are concerned, for a more unpopular official than Yuan, \'tis said, never, existed. One of the worst charges Yuan faced from this side of the globe, was that he ate his chow mien out of a golden bowl, and his chop suoy, sticks were of the glittering metal. He also shut himself up in the royal, palace and refused to receive callers, which did not look to most of the, laymen Chinese like a very democratic thing to do., Horse Car Still Traverses New York’s Streets, MYORK. The obsequies of the horse car have not yet been sung in, ll this city. They are still in use on several busy thoroughfares and the, sight of them permits the stranger from Squeedunk to be annoyingly face, tut: litre mat uio cuy, relation has repeatedly informed him, that this is a progressive town Som, berly and sadly these horse cars, thread their res^ned way through, Chambers street, in the downtown, section. The car itself, with its dusty, windows, its fading colors, its obso, lete lettering, and its front platform, three or four feet lower or higher than, the rear, is certainly a novel sight., "Everybody is kicking about how, slow these old cars are,” said the, ariver as he flicked his whip upon the backs of his unfeeling steeds. “ ’Tain t, their fault. Everything\'s got the right of way over us. Gotta wait for the, trolleys; gotta hold up for the trucks; get stuck in the middle of the road,, and the whole fool city curses us. I’ve been drivin\' these cars for 30 years, an’ more, an’ seems it\'s about time to take \'em off. They don\'t appreciate, us, they don\'t. What could a trolley do on these streets? Nothin\'; abso, lutely nothin\'. These horses can pimp over a truck or climb a barricade, an’, the car, it can turn right angles. Who cares" Nobody* All we get is, jeers an\' curses. It is hard lines, when you come to think of it.", Following the Initial Vogue in Coats, Very rich-looking coats are made of, smooth-surfaced cloths, with fine, heavy broadcloth heading the list of, desirables. They are useful for wear, at almost any time, quiet and elegant, looking, and many of them finished, with velvet in the collar and cuffs., A good example of the plain cloth, coat is given in the picture shown, here. It follows the initial styles of, the present season, in a conservative, way, with its high, flaring collar, full, and slightly flaring skirt, and large, coat sleeves. The belt is placed in a, novel way, slipping under a panel at, the back of the coat and ending, like, many others, in rounded ends at each, side., Buttons in two sizes, made by cov, ering molds with the cloth, are used, for fastening the coat and to provide, for its decoration. They appear down, the front, at the ends of the belt and, on the panel at the back, in the large, size. The smaller buttons are placed, at the front of the collar and In close, set rows on the velvet inlay at the, cuffs., Coats of this kind are lined for, warmth and made in the roomy fash, ion that allows a knitted vest or, sweater to be worn under them in, the extremest weather. They are, usually double breasted and made with, straight and amplo coat sleeves that, are relieved from a too plain effect, by the management of the cuffs. These, are cut with a certain eccentricity or, trimmed noticeably so that they are, in keeping with the collar, which is, featured in accordance with the sea, son\'s demands., A model, like the one shown here,, that contrives to be conservative with, out being commonplace, and smart, without any indication of the sports, styles, deserves the attention of the, woman of quiet taste., About the Newest Party Gowns, The lightest of satin, both as to, 1 weight and color, continues to provide, the most popular of foundations for, party gowns. The airier fabrics, used over It sometimes match in color, but are more often contrasting, The foundation skirts of satin, in, the newest gowns, are often deeply, slashed, with the slashes either round, I ed or pointed at the bottom. The over, draperies are sometimes bound but, j quite as often left unfinished, and they, are uneven. Very deep points and, I apron draperies or full godet folds, solve the problem of a sufficiently ir, responsible finish at the bottom., Wide shadow laces made into short, sleeveless jackets, tabs of narrow, satin ribbon finished with small chif, fon roses, and shoulder bows of nar, row ribbon, are among the prettiest of, finishing details. Metallic gauzea and, ribbons are used instead of satin when, the metal-thread laces are used to nn, ish the bottom of the foundation skirt, or for the lace jacket., The simple gown shown in the pic, ture has a baby waist and plain skirt, of satin. A full panel of chiffon is, brought down the front of the gown, and forms a drapery over the bodice., It is outlined on the waist with opal, escent sequins, and there is a gay lit, tle bow of satin ribbon at the shoul, ders., The girdle is of crushed satin edged, with chiffon roses in very pale tints, of several colors, which take up the, coloring which gleams in the sequins., Satin slippers and silk hose to match, the frock make up all that could be, asked for in a girlish dance costume., /, CALOMEL IS MERGURY, IT SICKENS!, STOP USING SALIVATING DRUG, Don’t Lose a Day’s Work!

They are generally as, signed to the Orient, but they are, now almost universal in currency and, popularity. The backs of old English, cards were generally plain, and thus, it was that when paper was scarce or, expensive, old cards were too useful, to be destroyed. They were, on the, contrary, used for various purposes., Thus they are often found in the, bindings of old books, where they, were preserved. The old cards were, also sometimes cut up for paper dolls., They were also used as cards of in, vitation and as visiting cards. Thack, eray refers to this in "Henry, Esmond.”, The earliest examples of wood cuts, were intended for playing cards. They, antedate the famous St. Christopher, wood cut that is sometimes credited, with being the earliest., In the olden days playing cards, in, stead of knitting, were used by spec, tators in playhouses as an amusement, while waiting for the performance to, begin., Such widely differing materials as, silver, leather, paper, wood, parch, ment. cardboard, deerskin and even, buffalo hide have all been used iu, making playing cards., The Japanese Woman., The Japanese woman exists pri, marily for and in the family. We still, adhere to the old way of thinking that, her natural habitat is the home, and, that her appearance\' at the polls is, as unnatural as on the battlefield. Let, it be far from me to give an impres, sion, already too prevalent abroad and, at home, that we look upon women, only as cogs in the machinery of the, kitchen or as mere puppets and orna, ments in the parlor, writes Doctor, Nitrobe in the Japanese Nation. The, personality cf the fair sex is net as, clearly recognized among us as it, ought to be; but 1 am confident that, it will come with more general en, lightenment of public conscience. As, it is at present, the aim of female, education is to make "a good wife and, a wise mother," a stereotyped shib, boleth on the lips of all educators and, of the nation, circumscribing the end, and aim of woman\'s life. According, to this doctrine, it is not as person,, but as Rife and mother, that woman, is to bo educated., Infection Through Cigar Cutters., When it is recognized how easily, the cigar cutter may be the means of, spreading Infection, and infection of, a dangerous nature, the days of this, article of convenience will be num, bered. To illustrate: a person will, often, after he has first held his cigar, in his mouth, step to the counter and, put his cigar into the cutter. This, thoughtless yet dangerous habit is so, common that it can be witnessed time, after time at every cigar stand. Un, doubtedly it has been one of the prin, cipal means of spreading infection, among those who smoke cigars, and it, is high time that an agent so potent, for harm was abolished.—American, Medicine., Aztecs Favored Turquoise., At the time of the Spanish conquest, under Cortez, the Aztecs of old Mexi, co employed turquoise and “chalchi, hultl,” a similar stone of greenish hue,, in many of their ceremonies. These, Spaniards, entering the region now oc, cupied by New Mexico and Arizona,, found the turquoise there also held in, high regard, and recent excavations In, the ancient pueblos and cliff dwellings, of these states have revealed many, turquoise ornaments which reflect, credit upon artistic ability of those, early workers, . \' --——, FEEDING ANIMAL MAHER ECONOMICALLY, —-- - - - «■ ""»■ - -, 1 Self-Feeder for Dry Feed—Hopper for Oyster Shells—Watering Device., (By M. BOYER.), Up to about 1889, winter egg-pro, duction was not much of a feature,, great as the demand was, for the rea, son that there seemed no possible way, of getting the hens down to solid work., There was an improvement, how, ever. when better houses, better feed, ing and better care were employed;, but still the supply was meager con, sidering the output at the present day., The matter of food finally became a, serious subject, resulting in the con, clusion that more animal food must, be placed on the bill of faro., But, how\' to furnish it economically, j did not manifest itself until F. VV., ; Mann, in 1889, Invented and placed on, ! the market a crude machine, but., I nevertheless, the initiative of the, 1 present high-class green-bone cutters, | now so extensively used. This was, | the original bone cutter, and it is a, ; matter of poultry history that the term, ■ bone cutter was actually coined by, ! Mr. Mann., According to analysis by Prof. James, E. Hice the nutritive value of green, bone is 1:5.3, which is greater than, any other form of meat—meatscrap,, dried blood, dried fish or animal meal,, j Hens are worm and Insect hunters,, and where they do not havo range,, must be supplied a substitute in some, form. Particularly in the summer, the, handiest meat food is meat scrap and, meat meal, many brands of which are, i on the market., Green bone is better for fall, winter, and early spring use. It is safo to, , feed in an egg ration one-tenth to ono, | fifth by weight of meat in the total, I ration, the quantity varying with the, richness of the meat and other foods, ; used., It is best to mix the meat in the, real feed. But in the case of green, j cut bone it is more satisfactory to, feed in troughs, allowing a pound of, green bone for every 16 fowls, or, an, ounce per head., The animal foods the fowls gather, while on a free range are usually high, in percentage of nitrogenous matter,, and not a large proportion of fat., Many of the artificial foods, excepting, such as dried blood and skim milk,, contain usually, besides nitrogenous, matter, a high percentage of fat., which is not especially desired in com, pounding a ration., i*For instance, both earthworms and, grasshoppers contr.in nearly ten times, as much protein as fat, while ordinary, fresh cut bone contains about equal, parts of protein and fat., Mistakes have been made in feeding, green bone in giving too liberal a, quantity. An excess will produce, aggravated diarrhea and worms and, a too liberal supply of meat scrap is, apt to cause an overfat condition of, the fowls., It may be possible to have poultry, live without any animal matter, but, for profit and thrift it is necessary, that they receive a certain per cent of, meat in the daily bill of fare, espe, cially when they are confined to runs,, or to houses in winter., It is claimed that 100 pounds of, fresh hen manure contains about 50, pounds of water, 16 pounds of or, ganic matter and 56 pounds ash, Analysis shows that poultry manure, contains 2.43 per cent phosphoric, acid, 2.26 per cent potash, and 3 25, per cent nitrogen, as ammonia and, organic matter., The average hen outlives her use, fulness in two years and is more, ! profitable sent to market. There are, at times good hens in tho third and, even the fourth year, but the average, limit is two. Old hens are more likely, to contract diseases than the younger, ones., It is a good plan to have awnings, or hoods of cheap muslin or boards, to go over the windows of the hen, house in summer to keep out tho sun, and thus keep the house cooler. It, is not advisable, however, to have, these awnings up during the winter,, as the sunlight Is needed in the house, to purify it., When the leg is bent the bird can, not open its foot. That is why it doeB, not fall off the perch at night when, asleep. When a hen is walking it, closes its toes as it raises the foot and, opens them as the foot touches the, ground., Tho imports of the products of, poultry culture into this country from, foreign countries show that the field, is still open to a large increase of the, industry in the United States, and that, the opportunity is waiting for those, with sagacity and industry enough to, take advantage of it., Compared with well-rotted barn, yard manure, there are 48,60 pounds, A Purebred., or phosphoric acid in hen manure to, six in barnyard manure; 41 pounds, of potash to 10 in barnyard manure, and 07 pounds nitrogen to 11 in, barnyard manure. This analysis is, based on a ton each of hen and barn, yard manures., It is common to call all poultry, "chickens." but strictly speaking, a, chicken is a young fowl, generally, under six months of age, and a “fowl”, is one over that age. On the same, basis, a young male under one year, of age, or a young female of the same, age, are known as cockerel and pullet,, respectively. They become cock and, hen after that., Referring to the value of coal tar,, Hotchkiss says that if it is put in rat, holes, runs, etc., rats, mice, minks, and weasels will desert tho premises., It is equally effective for lice, by coat, ing it on the roost. For the latter it, may be thinned with gasoline, if de, sired, and applied to perch and walls, of the poultry houses with a whisk, broom once a year. The writer has, found gas tar an excellent remedy for, scaly-legged fowls., One application is generally suffi, cient to clean off the scales. Give the, legs a good coating, allowing it to, wear off. and the chances are the, scales not only drop off, but tho leg, is in finer condition than by the use, of grease., SORGHUMS GOOD FOR SILAGE, Trouble Caused by Souring May Be, Avoided If Plants Are Allowed, to Mature Sufficiently., (By JOHN M SCOTT. Vice Director of, Florida University Experiment Sta, tion.), Sorghums for silage should be cut, when the seeds are in the hard dough, stage or even when they are mature, There has been some objection to the, sorghums because they are supposed, to make sour silage It is likely that, this trouble will not be encountered, If they are allowed to mature suffl, ciently., Silage made from cowpeas and sor, ghums is exceptionally good. The pro, tein of cowpeas will counteract the, excess carbohydrates in the sorghum, and thus narrow the ration Cut the, cowpeas when the pods have formed, and before they have filled. Make the, ratio half and half or two or three of, sorghum to one of cowpeas Beggar, weed will also make an excellent mix, ture with sorghum., Japanese cane makes good silage,, but it is better when mixed with some, material to give it bulk and to coun, teract the excess of carbohydrates. !t, is usually cut some time in November., B^eak a Horse Decently., it takes from three to six months to, break a horse decently., MISTAKE TO SELL HAY CROP, Seldom That Price Received Equals, Feeding and Fertilizing Value If, Fed at Home., iRy E. L. JORDAN. Louisiana University, Experiment Station.l, It is a mistake for our farmers to, sell their hay crop unless the prices, received are such as to cover both, the feeding and fertilizing value of, the hay if fed at home., It is seldom that the price received, equals both these values, and the fer, tilizing value, at least, is lost. A well, balanced farm should carry enough, live stock to consume all the rough, age and grain the farm can produce., If more hay is produced than Is, needed at home, then only :he best, should bo sold, as tho inferior grades, will not bring enough on the market, to justify selling, but will have a bad, effect on the market., Good Dairy Combination., The dual purpose cow and the cen, tralized creamery make a good dairy, combination. The cow don\'t care how, much cream she gives and the cream, ery don’t care how often the cream is, delivered., Value of a Horse., The value of a horse depends, first,, uron his breeding, and next upon hla, first year\'s keeping., \\, BENEFIT IN DAILY TUBBING, Required for Proper Preservation of, Health and Looks—Turkish, Bath Works Wonders., It would be wrong to prescribe hot, water baths for all the world of wom, en, for there are undoubtedly condi, tions when they would be harmful, is, the assertion made by a prominent, physician. But daily tubbing in water, of some temperature or other is re, quired for looks and health, and if, the heart is in good condition, the, benefits of the hot tub are undeniable., So the long dead beauties of ancient, Greece and Home kept themselves, fair, and so the beauty of today builds, up her looks when she finds they are, beginning to wane with time or a, fevered life. Weak woman anxious, for their looks crowd tho Turkish, bath, boiling and steaming away com, plexion hurts, rejuvenating muscles,, lightening their bodies of superfluous, flesh, soothing their nerves. And If, they are used to such baths, or to, some other preferred kind, they feel, ns tit as race horses for a week after, ward., Some medical facts concerning the, usual effects of the hot or cold bath, give this illuminating information:, The hot bath facilitates and stimu, lates tho natural combustion processes, of the body; the cold bath, to produce, the same results, lavishes just four, times the same amount of energy., Tho cold bath is not 80111016011)0, cleansing for the health of the akin,, and when there is a predisposition to, skin troubles the chilly water tends, to Increase them. The process called, "hardening," which consists in sub, mitting one’s system to the shock of, cold plunges, is thought, too, the, worst thing in the world for any but, the most vigorous constitutions., SOMETHING TO BE ACQUIRED, Possession of Good Taste la Almost, Entirely a Matter of Assiduous, Cultivation., If we would possess good taste we, must take pains about It. We must, study models, we must follow exam, ples, we must compare methods, and, (above anything else) we must cru, cify the natural man. If there Is one, thing to be dreaded In these mat, ters it is what is called the unaided, intelligence of the masses. A crudely, colored oleograph of the Albert memo, rial may give pleasure to an unaided, intelligence, but is that pleasure to, be compared In depth of satisfaction, with that which is afforded when the, educated eye feasts upon the nature, interpreting canvas of a great artist?, All, I think, are agreed about the, study of the models; of the things, which are attested . . ., We may then, I think, assume that, the best way of telling a good book, i from a bad one is to make yourself, as well acquainted as you can with, some of the great literary models. Do, not be frightened at them. They af, ford the widest choice; they are all, tbr moods. There is no need tc like, them all alike.—Augustine Birrell., How Land Work Affects Climate., The character of climates is vari, ously affected by the presence or ab, I sence of trees and other vegetation., In a British association address, Sir, Charles P. Lucas noted that climates, became both hotter and colder when, the surface of tho earth has been bared, by the cutting down of trees; they be, come drier or moister with the de, j struction or planting of trees; and, j healthfulness or unhealthfulness may, | be determined by the removal or re, 1 taining of the forests. The Canadian, northwest is cited as an example., Broken cr plowed land does not re, tain snow and ice like the unbroken, prairie surface, but it is more reten, tive of moisture and the heat of the, 8U’- As a result there has been per, le agricultural improvement of, t: climate, with an extension of the, wheat belt considerably farther north, than formerly. Lord Strathcona be, lieved that the rails and telegraph, lines of the Canadian Pacific railway, brought some change even before the, | coming of the settlers, an increase in, dew and moisture having been quite, : evident near the railway., Sympathy Is Great‘Need., A blight which often falls upon the, souls of men who have studied long, and perhaps bear learned titles is the, blight of a narrow and ungenial view, of life. They end at the barred window,, and not at an open doorway. Sympa, thy puts the crown upon the head of, the educated man. He has a fellow, feeling for all men, because his wide, experience of life has enabled him, to understand them. Mingled in this, sympathetic attitude of the educated, man is humility, that grows out of, knowledge. He stands with Newton, on the shore, aware of the wide, un, attempted sea. He knows that the, corner of knowledge whore he works,, though but a corner, is yet related, to all learning and all places where, others are at work., Censoring “Romeo and Juliet”, Speaking of "Romeo and Juliet,", what would an official censor say of, it if it were put in the movies?

In telling o" her case she says:, "I had been treated by four different, physicians during 10 years of stomach, trouble.

(Special.)—“The peo, ple of tho south must quit eating their, cotton or other so-called ‘cash crop\', before it is made if ihey ever expect, to accumulate wealth and have the, comforts and luxuries of life due, them,” says H. G. Hastings, agricul, tural lire president of the Atlanta, Chamber of Commerce, and a fore, most authority on farm conditions In, the southeast., "The south must stop forever its, time-honored system of economic sui, cide,\'\' says Mr. Hastings. “Advance, steps were made last year toward a, condition of farm Independence in ttie, Cotton Belt. They were forced steps,, ii is true, but they marked an advance, just the same, and more bread and, meat, more grain, forage and other, food and feed stuffs were made in, 1915 than ever before, with the result, there are tens of thousands of farm, ers belter off than in past years,, despite short crops and business de, pression., “With higher cotton prices, it is, going to be a great temptation to, drop back into the old habit of put, ting cotton, or whatever other cash, crop one may he growing, in pawn, for bread and meat. Wo are suffer, ing today from the old system forc, ed on us by conditions following the, t ivil war, necessary then, hut unnec, essary now., "Year after year we have stayed In, tin* same old rut as a mutter of habit,, eating our crops, so to speak, before, they were made, a financially suicidal, policy for the farmer, eacli year put, ting his nose a little closer to the, credit grindstone., “If the south had not been so rich, In natural resources, this system, would have bankrupted us long ago., What’s the answer? It is home pro, duction by each farmer of every dol, lar\'s worth of food and grain supplies, needed on his farm tlint it is possi, ble to grow on his own acres.

II. Bishop, being an, itinerant Methodist preacher, lived as, Mr. Bishop termed it, "All over, northeast Missouri. \' In 1902, when, Howard was 12 years of age the fam, ily moved to Beebe, Arkansas, where, they lived for five years. Here Mr., Bishop finished the Grammar grades, and High School. Then for educa, tion facilities they moved to Conway, in 1910, where Mr. Bishop entered, • the Senior Academy Class in Hen, [drix. He graduated from Hendrix, [ College in the class of 1915 as the, Honor A. B. Graduate., In high school he developed a lik, jing for Latin, Greek and football,, l and a strong dixlike for the fairer, sex (in the latter howeser lie has “re, formed.") In his early youth "Bish,”, as he is universally known in Con, way, showed a strong tendency for, being a "butter." He is said to have, developed this tendency from play, ing with his father\'s sheep, goats and, calves in their own style. In his bril, liant career as a football player he, made constant and consistent use of, this “butting" ability., As an athlete Mr. Bishop was, among the best. II is name is always, linked with those of Holmes, Ilarton,, Charles and Staples. In football he, was a line man, one of the best, tackles that ever wore a Hendrix, uniform. 11 is playing, though never, flashy, spectacular or brilliant, was, always consistent, steady, forceful, and effective. He was never known, to take an unfair advantage of tm op, ponent on the field. As in everything, he stood squareh and unswervingly, for principle. In track he also ex, teiuHi. nr was aiwavt second in the, distance runs and hurdle races only, to “Woodrow Wilson. In what, seemed likely to he his most success, ful year in track work he fell while, running the hurdles and broke his, collar hone. Though this disabled, him somewhat, still he was able to, contribute his pari to the glory of, Hendrix at the annual Track Meet., As a college student he bears a, most enviable record. During his, first year in college he maintained a, very high average and each succeed, ing year his grade showed a higher, average, thus indicating a healthy, growth and closer devotion to his, work. In reviewing his record we, find that his course contains the, hardest, most difficult and most educa, tive subjects in the curriculum. He, never looked for nor chose the “easy, snaps" if there be those. He main, tained during his entire college course, an average grade of about 89 per, cent, which is most excellent. In, student activities Mr. Bishop always, was a leader. He was a leader be, cause he was capable of doing things, and was always interested. His ma, jor subject\'s in college were Latin and, Greek, of the latter he was assistant, instructor for two years in Hendrix., There was not a phase of college life, that he did not touch vitally., Howard Bishop was a man, reserv, ed though amiable, amicable, capable, with a deep sense of personal honor,, and a profound respect for the l ights, and feelings of others. His person, ality was commanding both of respect, and confidence which is attested by, the various positions of honor and re, sponsibility to which he was elected, by the literary societies and student, body at large. Hollowing are a few, of the most significant of these:, Assistant Business Manager of, Mirror 1918-14., Assistant Editor of Mirror 1914-15., Athletic Editor of Troubadour, 1914-15., Editor - in - Chief of Troubadour, 1913-14., Joint Open Session Debater 1914., I liter-Society Debater (June) 1915., President Hendrix Debating Coun, cil 1914-15., President of Hendrix College Men’s, Sunday School Class 1914-15., President Conwa\\ Epworth Ixaigue, 1912-13., Captain Hendrix Track Team 1914., All-Star Football player two years,, 1913 and 1911., He is of a brilliant mind, powerful, athletic body and pleasing disposi, , tion., As a Rhodes scholar we are confi, dent that the committee who chose, him shall never rue their selection., | We are also confident that he accept, ed the scholarship with a full realiza, tion of the ideals which Cecil Rhodes, had when he founded it, and that he, will use it as was intended by the, founder., 1 He experts’ to make the educational, field his life\'s work and with his, training in Economics and Sociology, in Oxford we are sure he can come, ONION SALT, A perfect seasoning for meats, eggs, etc. Contains, only pure salt and onions, concentrated, dried and, ground., Sanitary Bread, Groceries Bakery In Connection, COLE & COMPANY, The House of Quality., back to Arkansas where he has been, educated and contribute to the edu, cation and youth of this state., ()i course Hendrix feels proud and, justly so, of this her son. We con, gratulate him and wish him success, commensurate with his efforts and, desserts., —Hendrix Hulldoif., _ e*, WAY OF THE QUITTER., The world has little use for a quit, ter. The fellow who starts and backs, out because the creek is up. The fel, low that promises to saw wood for, you Wednesday, discovers about nine, o\'clock there is a screw loose in the, end of his saw, and sends you word, Saturday that he could not come. The, fellow who starts to trim the hedge,, blisters his hands and decides to let, it go until spring., The boy who goes racing through, his school books until he strikes par, ticiples and compound fractions, then, wants to quit school and get a job., The girl who starts out to be a great, musician and learns just enough to, play rag-time to beguile the fancies, of some young saphead., There is a big family of these quit, ters, but they are all a sorry lot. They, never want a job that takes time and, patience., vv uii tut; quaiim ciLiouM ui u uin, poster they would like to earn the, salary of a railroad president. Their, ideal is a job that requires only two, hours of easy labor each day with, Saturdays and holidays off., You will find them scattered all up, and down the road of human failure,, always turning back from the handle, of the plow, always complaining of, their lot and the unfairness of the, world., They are clogs in the wheels, brok, en rails on the road, time-killers; pa, tience-killers, forever wanting what, they have not deserved., ^The only people who accomplish, Uiings in this world are those who, qualify themselves in spite of bad, crops, high water and measles. Who, hang on to the work until failure, turns to victory, whose courage rises, as difficulties thicken, and whose faces, are forever toward the rising sun., It was a bad plan, that of the In, dians, flinging their boys into the riv, er where they had to swim or drown., The best thing any parent can do for, his child is to compel him to finish, what he undertakes. Keep his at, it, and no matter how much he cries, and objects, make him do the thing, he started to do. And the best thing, any boy or girl can do is to do this, very thng without being made to do, it., Success is a good deal in habit., There is not much difference between, failure and success. Simply one quits, and the other does not.—Ex., —Ileudrix Bulldog., Onildren Cry, FOR FLETCHER’S, O ASTORIA, MISS MYRTLE GREESON, Instruction in Piano, History, of Music and Harmony, Studio in Donaghey Bldg., HENRY THORN DEAD., Henry Thorn, 19 years old, son of, Mrs I.
