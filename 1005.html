But that\nwasn\'t even, mentioned in court The\nboy was on trial for stealing from\nthe store; the store wasn\'t tried for\nstealing from George -So the $8-a\nweek, wage wasn\'t eyen mentioned\n;.rfMefcgfctiiaAfefct!.fcfct-fckfcJ', 'A year and eight months ago\nGeorge went to work at Carson\'s. He\nwas a clean-cut young fellow, with a\nhigh school education. Carson\'s paid\nhim $6 a week to start -\nAfter twelve months) when George\nwas proven a good salesman who\nwas courteous, attentive and attrac\ntive, this millionaire firm raised\nGeorge\'s salary to show him they ap\npreciated his effort.\nThey gave him $8 a week.\nNow the boy needed more than\n$8 a week o live on. rHis father was\ndead and his mother living in pov\nerty In Lexington, Ky. She needed\nmoney.\nShe sent her boy, her only son, to\nChicago, because there was a better\nchance for him to make good "here.\nAnd before he was long gone she be\ngan getting small money orders from\nGeorge, so she knew he had a job\nand was making money.\nAll this time George was getting\njust $6 a week from Carsons. There\nwere no bonuses, percentages or ex\ntras. He got only $6 in his pay en\nvelope every week.\nSo George stole. He took some\nextra salesslips, gave them to Albert\nClay, a boy friend, and carried out\na few pairs of gloves now and then.\nClay took the goods to his home at\n1926 S. Trumbull av. and returned\nto the store next day. He got the\nprice of the gloves refunded.\nThe boys split the tnoney they got.\nAlbert spent his; he felt that he need\ned more than the $12 a week he got\nat Gage\'s hat works.\nBut George sent part of his to the\nmother back in Lexington. The rest\nwent toward paying for tuition in a\nnight school and for food and cloth\ning which the little wage failed to\nprovide.\nGeorge was caught, taken into\n"court and branded a thief through\nthe efforts of Carson\'s secret service\nsystem, which costs the store many\nthousands of dollars a year and\nwliich shows up employes who steal\n1 "Mae their wages are too small.\nj One of Car&on-Pirle\'s well-paid\n; Bleuths was in Judge Dolan\'s court\nthis morning to tell of George\'s\nwrong-doings. He treated the case\nkindly, showed the judge how the\nboys had committed the thefts and\nthen admitted that George was an\nunusually clean, industrious young\nfellow.\n"Carson, Pirie, Scott & Co. hates\nto see these boys go\' to jail," he ad\nmitted. "But there has to be some\nthing done. We can\'t let employes\nsteal from us. We must set an ex\nample." The Rev. Frank Beck of the Cov\nenant church of Evanston was\nstanding near by; he had heard the\nfacts. He stepped up.\n"Judge, I think there must \'be\nsomething wrong with things. This\nboy seems to be bright and indus\ntrious," he said.

STRIKE ORDER\nRECALLED NO CHANGE IN EMPLOYES\' STAND\nWashington, Aug. 30. President\nWilson today was exerting every\neffort to secure from the railroad\nbrotherhood leaders a withdrawal of\ntheir strike order, effective Sept. 4.\nBelieving that congress is certain\nto pass legislation such as the broth\nerhoods are demanding, administra\ntion officials have pointed out the\ntrainmen would have nothing to gain\nby striking and everything to lose.\n\' Thus far, however, the brother\nhoods have indicated no intention of\nrescinding their strike order.\nThe railroad strike tying up every\npiece of rolling stock in the country\nwill be in eff:ect Monday, brother\nhood men said today. The order for\nit includes every brotherhood man in\nthe United States both in passenger\nand in freight traffic.\nWhile the freight men are the only\nones making demands, the passenger\nmen are included in the strike order.\nThe unions have decided the leg\nislative program will not alter their\ndetermination to strike; prominent\nbrotherhood men reiterated today\nthat only railroad acceptance of the\n8-hour-day 10-hour-pay proposal can\nhead off the tieup.\nWashington, Aug. 30. "No power\nunder heaven short of a satisfactory\nsettlement by the railroads can pre\nvent the railroad men from striking\nLabor day," W. G. Lee, trainmen\nleader, declared after talking with\nSec\'y of Labor Wilson.\nWashington, Aug. 30. Congress\ntoday formally took up herculean\ntask of preventing worst industrial\nstruggle in history strike of 400,\n000 employes on 250,000 miles of the\ncountry\'s 225 railroads, set for Mon\nday. Despite failure of federal board of\nmediation and conciliation and of\nPres. Wilson to bring railroad heads\nand railroad brotherhood chiefs to\nagreement, and in face of Mtter op- r\nposition to some of suggestions made\nby Pres. Wilson in his address to con\ngress yesterday, there was an air of\noptimism present as senate interstate\ncommerce committee met to weave\npresident\'s suggestions into legisla\ntive form.\nSenate Democratic and Republican\nmembers are unanimous on one\npoint: The strike must be prevented.\nFor this reason it was tentative\nplan to rush through senate bill con\ntaining only those suggestions of the\npresident which will achieve this\nwithout being subject to attack and\nruinous delay through debate.\nThis effort being successful, it was\nagreed that provisions which would\nengender long debates could be tak\nen up as amendments at later date.\nInquiry among members, of con\ngress who are classed as progressive\nDemocrats or progressive Republi\ncans and who might, it was felt, be\nopposed to provisions which would\nseem to be greatly to advantage of\nrailroads, disclosed that these pro\ngressives might be expected to sup\nport those provisions which provide\nfor:\nAn eight-hour day, authorization\nof a commission to study and report\nto congress on the effects of the\neight-hour day, commission of me\ndiation, conciliation and arbitration,\nwith a clause compelling delay in\nfuture strikes until this commission\nmight investigate.\nThe progressives will be opposed\nto provisions which call for enlarge\nment of interstate commerce com\nmission and increase of freight\nrates to compensate roads for pos\nsible wage raises.\no o\nINJUNCTION AGAINST STRIKE\nOmaha, Neb., Aug. 30. District\nCourt Judge Sears this afternoon is\nsued an order restraining trainmen\nemployed on the Union Pacific rail\nroad from striking Labor dayj\n, . .... .s- .- .- Ar .ttt LfeA;l', 'FREIGHT HANDLERS\' DEMAND\nFAIR DEAL OR STRIKE\nIf the railroads of Chicago won\'t\ngive their freight handlers a square\ndeal, then they will have to endure\na general strike of the handlers.\nMore than 1,000 unidn freight han\ndlers met at Hodcarriers\' hall last\nnight and enthusiastically voted for\na general strike this afternoon un\nless the railroads meet the demands\nof the union, which is only that rep\nresentatives of the union be per\nmitted to collect union dues from the\nmen on company property at periods\nwhen, the men are not working.\nThe Monon is the only road that\nhas signed up with the union. About\n6,000 freight handlers are in the\nunion, union leaders say.\nAt an enthusiastic meeting held at\n516 S. Halsted st this morning the\nmen reiterated their intention to call\na general strike unless the railroads\ngranted their demandB, which In\nvolve neither shortening of hours nor\nan increase in wages.\nTwo hundred freight handlers of\nthe Soo line joined the strike this\nmorning and strike orders have been\nissued against the Lake Shore, St\nPaul, Rock Island, Gf\'eat Western\nand I.

Senator\nCummins today in a senate speech\ndenounced "so-called compulsory ar\nbitration" as an impossibility. There\nis no power, he said, in which federal\nor Btate governments can force men\nto\' work when they do not-want to. a.\nThis, he said, would be the case un-\nder any actual compulsory arbitra\ntion law.

John W. Eckhardt,\nwho, with Loeb, runs the board, says\nthe teachers will get no more votes\ntoday than, they got in June. But\nothers say that Dr. Peter C. Clem\nensen has been won over to the jus\ntice of the teachers\' fight and will\nvote for their reinstatement, and\nthat other trustees are in doubt. v\nWhether the teachers have gained\nany trustees to their side during the\nsummer will be shown. It is report\ned that several trustees have realized\nthat Loeb\'s anti-Catholic moves may\nbe construed as political.\nThe fight of the teachers is now\nmore intense because of the discov\nery that if they lose out their pen\nsion fund can be confiscated and that\nteachers who believed themselves\neligible for pensions will get nothing.\nEckhart, through the Chicago Tri\nbune this morning, made a desperate\neffort to deny the pension fund was\nendangered, but th& teachers have\nshown up the joker in the school\nboard law to prove their case.\nTrustee Charles Peterson an\nnounced yesterday he was going to\nvote against the Loeb rule,, He is the\nlatest convert. The teachers need\ntwo more.\n$ One of the teachers who was\naroppea oy tne enforcement or the\nLoeb rule had the following to say of\nthe pension situation:\n"If it is true, as the papers have\nstated, that the rights of the teach\ners dropped by the board of educa\ntion in June are endangered under\nthe pension law, it is time some\nthing was done. Surely the people\nof Chicago are not going to allow\nteachers whose record of efficiency\nis unquestioned to be turned adrift\nin this summary fashion. It\' is bad\nenough to take away their means of\nlivelihood, giving the mno chance to\nto the force of the blow.\n"If the rights of the teachers are\ntaken away it means that they can\nnot accept a position elsewhere\nwithout losing their pensions. These\nteachers have worked in the Chica\ngo public schools for years. They\nhave paid hundreds of dollars into\nthe pension fund, all of which will be\ntaken from them.\n"If the members of the board of\neducation were seeking to benefit\nthe schools by eliminating\' teachers\nwhose presence is a detriment, they\nwould proceed in a manner free\nfrom unsual malice. Punitive action\ntakes away all claim of good inten\ntions. Somebody is paying a per\nsonal or political grudge when so\nmuch unnecessary bitterness is put\ninto the1 act Teachers should be\ndropped from the service if their\nwork fs not good for the schools, but\nthey should not be shut away from\nthe possibility of earning a liveli\nhood elsewhere, neither should their\nright to a pension be taken away nor\ntheir payments of past years confis\ncated. \'\n"There is only one way to make\nthe matter right. If there is the\nslightest possibility that the rights\nof the teachers under the pension\nlaw is in danger, the board of edu\ncation should reinstate them at once\nand then proceed to protect the\nschools from inefficiency in some\nway which will not be open to a sus\npicion of malice and injustice. The\nschools belong to the people after all\nand the people will question the\nboard of education about this and\ncontinue questioning until all is\nmade clear."\n453,314 men and 241,924 women of\nChicago may vote at primaries,\n--,j-mt ,...- - iiitLtAlAJJ.iAiAiJA', 'yKjJLLKAKmmmmmmmmm!mmmmmmm\nr\ni,\nNEWS OF THE DAY CONCERNING CHICAGO\nCase of" Violet\' Phipps, charged\nwith contributing to delinquency of\n"Marion Phipps," 6, nonsuited.

Moreover, -the17"\nchambers-of commerce of New York,\nPhiladelphia and other big shipping\'-!\ncities are demanding that Uncle k-eep\nat the insurance .business until the 3\nwar is over, at any rate. i\nNow Uncle had demonstrated twos\nthings by this experiment that was\nforced on him, to-wit: 4\nThe enormous profits in the Insur\nance business. v I\nThe fact that these enormous \'\nnroflts can be made if income is not""\npaid out for fancy salaries to non\nworking company presidents, vice6\npresidents, directors and legal talent\nand for fancy offices and office fur-\nniture. . i\nWho pays the enormous insurance\nprofits on shipping insurance?

Indirectly but sure-1\nly, Uncle Sam returns to us his two\nmillions of insurance profits, end how\nstupid in us-not \'to ask whether a\nthing so good for us in times of forf\neign war wouldn\'t be the same good\nthing for us in all our times of doi\nmestie peace! I\nVerily, the plundered railroads, the\nreckless trusts and the, cowardly -pri-J\nvate cinches "are great instruments\nfor the spreading of propaganda "Let\nUncle Sam Do It!"\nTHEY NOW ADMIRE DEMOC-f\nPfACY.

It seems to me that the\nimportant function of our so-called\nnewspapers today is to keep the gen\neral public in the dark by not pub\nlishing the real news. They print\nplenty of bunk, phony ads and news\nwhich is of no particular importance\nto the average working man, and\ncolumns of stuff about murders, so\nciety divorce cases, sporting and\nfinancial news, but they fail to print\nreal news that is of interest to work\ning men. For instance:\nVery little labor union news is pub\nlished unless it is to discredit the\nunions. The larger part of the peo\nple of Chicago do not seem to know\nthat the mayor of Milwaukee is a\nSocialist This is probably caused by\nthe papers not publishing the returns\nof the election in Milwaukee last\nspring. Comparatively few people\nknow much about the Pittsburgh\nstrike cases, where men and women\nwere jailed on the charge of inciting\nto riot when as a matter of fact the\nstrike-breaking guards were the\nguilty ones.\nNot much has been said about the\nstrike-breaking mine guards at Rosi-\nclare, HI., who forced some of the\nelected public officials to resign and\ndrove union miners out of the coun\nty. Very little is said about the\nstrike now in progress in the iron\nmines of the U. S. Steel Co. in Min\nnesota. The prospective strike of railroad\nworkers to secure an eight-hour day\nis twisted to mean that more wages\nis the thing that they are after, and\nthe poor, busted railroads, which dnly\ncleaned up about one thousand mil\nlion dollars last year, would have to\npay about one hundred million dol\nlars more in wages and they should\ntherefore be allowed to skinus a lit\ntle more.\nOn the other hand, we have been\nhanded all kinds of bunk relating to\nthe marching of unorganized work\ners in "preparedness parades" afl\nover thfi omintrv. all of which should\nhave been rightly called the march\nof the wage slaves. J. M. reign.\nk SEEK A WIDER VISION. A\nstrike of railroad workers is threat\nened. If it should come extensively\nenough to effect all the repuDlic it\nwill be worse than a war. The cause\nof it comes from the inability of most\nof us to see both sides of a contro\nversy. Deeper than that is the lack\nof perception of all of us when it f\ncqmes to considering questions that\naffect us closely and immediately.\nThe workers know that conditions\nare hard, the hours long and the re\nturns for labor inadequate. The\nbosses who direct labor know the\nsame thing, 4but away from the la\nborers and away from the bosses\nwho are in immediate touch with\nlabor there is the element of monop\noly inherent in laws, constitutions,\ninstitutions, beliefs and customs\nthat blinds labor bosses and monop\nolists alike to the real root of the\ntrouble.\nMonopoly controls transportation.\nIt controls finances, it controls legis\nlation, it controls finally the earth\nupon which we must live.\nHigher wages that come from\ncombinations of laborers fighting\nfor less than the whole force of la\nbor in existence only has the effect\nto benefit a few and that few at the\nexpense of the mass of those who\nlabor. Shorter hours for one occu\npation that come from strikes and\nlockouts alone and do not attack the\nmonopolies that make wages low\nand hours long will only benefit a\nfew. It will only add to our difficul\nties an aristocracy of labor that will\nfight for their special privilege as\nhard as the railroad magnates do for\ntheirs.\nBut a -wider vision will come to\nlabor later. A wider vision will come\nto the big monopolists also.

I have been\na regular reader of The Day Book\nsince its birth and have often desired\nto write, but was deterred only\nthrough fear of the microscopic crit\nicism of The Forum intellectuals. I\nhave .overcome this fear enough to\nwant to reply to an article which ap\npeared in The Day fiook of the 22d,\nunder the caption "\'Our People," by\none of your mosf scholarly contrib\nutors, Mr. J. F. tfendrick, with whom\nI must take issue w,hen he elects to\nmalign the human race for a trivial\noffense, which the race had been\nguilty of perhaps since its birth; and\nI will venture the guess that, not\nwithstanding Mr. J. P.

Is he so recondite that he f\nfails to perceive that "their fouling\nof their own nests" is but an insig\nnificant incident which Idealists have\ninveighed against since the dawn of\ntime? But unfortunately the "hu\nman race" in the very nature of its\ncomposition cannot conform to any\nideal prdgram or conception. This\nidealistic, complacent indifference to\nthe necessary accumulation ofa yet 1\nlimited experience of the much-maligned\nhuman race can\' only be over\ncome by the recognition that the hu\nman race does not achieve knowledge\na priori, but must traverse the path\nof bitter and adverse experience (wit\nness the present war) in its evolution\nto a higher organization.\nAs much as the "caustic criticism"\nof the "colossal stupidity?!\' if view\ned from the perch of the "ultra-erudite"\nof the human race is neces\nsary, it is always well to keep in mind\nthe necessitarian inevitableness of\nthese opposing forces, the interaction\nof which makes for progress in the\nabsence of a workable standard based\non pure reason or intelligence.\'\nPermit one to commend The Day\nBoek as one of the best educational\nforces in Chicago.\n"A ghastly sight" is an importa\ntion from London sponsored by "Sir\nfessor" Wilkesbarre and its imputa\ntion "to me is erroneous.
