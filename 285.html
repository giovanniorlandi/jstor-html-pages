IV.\nT\nBAIL REFUSED\nTWO PROMINENT MEN OF LAUREL GO\nTO JAIL\nProceedings of the Habeas Corpus in the\nMurder Case.\nw\npeclal to the Daily Progress.\nElliitille, J.\\n. 1 .—The habeas cor\nwhen\npus case ended this morning,\ncounsel for the defense announced\nany wit\nthat it would not put on\nnesses nor present argument against,\nleaving the whole matter to the dis\ncretoin of Judge Enochs. Counsel for\nprosecution stated their willingness to\nforego argument.\n, Judge Enochs then announced that\nDr. J. J. Harper and VV.\nmick would be remanded to jail with\nout bail.\nWalter H. Harper and H. A. John\nstone were allowed bail in the anm of\n$2,000 each.\nThe uergo Albert McGee was re\nR. McCor\nleased from custody.\nUp to noon yesterday the defen\ndants and their lawyers were satisfied\nIn the afternoon, when\nof success.\nF. P. Salter was recalled, then all\nSalter testified posi\nwent to pieces,\ntively that Dr. Harper told him that\nMcCormick shot the man.\nsummed up\nThe testimony, all\nOn the 6th of December Wil\nshows:\nlip.ru L. Lawrence was shot twice in\nthe back; that he was taken to the\nEastmau-Gardiuer logging camps bot\ntling works; that when he was laid\non a cot there his right eye was all\nright; that the house was locked by\nDr. Harper about 8 o\'clock Saturday\nevening, after everyone had been or\ndered ont; that at that time he was\nSunday evening the\nalive; that on\nright eye was badly fractured, and\nthe contents and blood was oozing out;\nthat Dr. Harper, Walter Harpe r , H.\nA. Johnstone and others repeatedly\nasserted that the man had notjbeen\n»hot, but was sick, the cause of death\nbeing giveu as heart disease, then\nlung trouble, then epileptic fits.\nYesterday Justice of the Peace Hin\nton testified that he was called to in\nvestigate the case and went to the\nground where the man laid, saw the\nwonnd in hit breast where one of the\nbullets came ont; saw blood on the\nman\'s breast, his hand and on the\ngronud, but did not ask anything\nabout it. He did not tell anyone that\na man had been shot, and when he\n\'returned Sunday evening to hold the\ninquest he did not go voluntarily.\nThe case against Dr. Harj»er and\nMcCormick, is very clear. No motive\nhas been shown, but this will come\nout next week at the regular bearing.\nJndge Enochs announced this morn\ning that the special term of court\nwould begin on the 6ht instant (next\nTuesday) and he notified all witnesses\nto be present.\nnesseS, of whom 22 were on the stand\nup to last evening at 4:30 o\'clock,\nwhen the state rested.\nThe state has 47 wit\n• NO LEGISLATION\nOn Trusts at the Present Session\nof Congress.\nWashington, Jau. 1.—Of the few\nthings to be done by the closing ses\n■ion of the fifty-seventh congress most\nhave been gotten well under way dur\ning the 22 days preceding the adjourn\nment for the holidays. There will be\nno trust legislation, notwithstanding\nthe president\'s recommendation on\nthe subject in his message and despite\nthe fact that at every opportunity he\nendeavored to impress upon republican\ncongressmen who called upon him at\n£he White house that they must do\nsomething in the shape of anti-trnst\nlegislation at this congress. Up to\ntJie hour of laying aside business for\n£)ie holidays neither judiciary com\nmittee had taken any very decided\nsteps toward the making of a bill to\nregulate or suppress the * \' bad trusts\nor to preserve and loster the "good\nlittle trusts.\nThe amiable and ancient Senator\nHoar, who is a lofty epitome of light\nand sweetness in the senate judiciary\ncommittee, obtained on "Wednesday of\nthe last week the senate sat the unu\nsual privilege of being permitted to\nfile ibe title of a bill which he hopes\nto illlrodoce soon for the regulation of\nthe t^na^s or corporations engaged in\ninteffcational or interstate commerce.\nIt is laid *be object had in view by\nthe tenerable senator was to get his\nbill printed and ready for distribution\nagainst the meeting of. the senate in\nJantaary 6. Just what the bill is in\ndetail or gist DObody apjibars to know,\ntboi$h the surmise . is ventured that\nit i*meattl to chime with the key\nStruck by Attorney - General Knox.\nJ 9\nV\nI\ny.\nT\nConjecture of this kind is due to the\nfact that Senator Hoar and Mr. Knox\nhave lately had several conferences.\nIt is possible that of this beginning\nwill come soon some sort of adminis\ntration measures.\nAffairs of the senate of the capitol\nwere conducted during the scant three\nweeks-of session before Christmas\nwith the usual venerable delibera\ntion. Three notable measures were\nunder discussion—the statehood, the\nimmigration bill .and the militia bill,\nor army officiency bill. The debate\non neither of these propositions can\nbe regarded as half done. There is\nno telling what amount of diliatorv\ntricks may be evolved for practice by\nthe time the senate meets. There i6\nan impression gaining ground that\nno territorial admission bill can be\npassed except one whicli will let in\nOklahoma and exclude Arizona and\nNew Mexico. Senator Bacon of Geor\ngia is ardently interested in the pas\nsage of a bill which will make a\nstate to be named in honor of Jeffer\nson out of the territories belonging to\nthe area of the Louisiana purchase,\nand it is apparent that this idea is\nwinning favor, though whether\nenough to bring success remains to be\nseen. The immigration bill devel\noped so much divergence of view\namong senaotrs as to its details that\nit is likely to consume not a little of\nthe time that will remain for the rest\nof the session. The very interesting\nmilitia bill, admitted even by its op\nponents as a most adritly framed\nmeasure for the aggrandizement of\nthe army, has provoked serious oppo\nsition, especially among veteran\ndemocratic senators, notably Bates,\nPettus and Bacon. It is regarded by\nthem as leaving top little for the\nstates in the control of their local\nmilitary establishments.\nBesids the bills named, others will\ncome to the senate which have been\npassed by the house, among them\nbeing the Philippines currency and\ntariff bills, the eight hour bill, legis\nlation for Alaska and the appropria\ntion bills. Then, too, the senate has\nto do with such robust questions as\nthe Panama canal convention, Cuba\nreciprocity, reciprocity arrangements\nwith France, the British West Indies,\nseveral South American countries,\nand, not least indeed, the Venezuelan\nsituation. It is easy to see that in\nthe approximately fifty working days\nthe senate has before it ere the end\nof this congress it has no more time\nfor recreation.\nPROHIBITION CONVENTION\nStrong Efforts Will Be Made to\nArouse Interest.\nSpecial to the Daily Progress.\nJackson, Jan. 1.—During the pres\nent mouth a strong effort will be made\nto arouse interest in the state prohibi\ntion convention to be held in Jackson\non the 17th of February for the pur\npose of arranging the plans for the\nstatutory prohibition campaign dur\ning the summer. Thus far very little\nenthusiasm has been aroused over the\nprospect of having the temperance\ncause mixed in politics, and the state\npress is almost a unit against the\nThe prohibitionists are not\nissue.\ndiscouraged, however, and promise to\nmake a spirited fight for their cause.\nANNUAL STATEMENT\nOf the Mississippi Capitol Com\nmission.\nSpecial to the Dally Progress.\nJackson, Jau. 1.—The annual state\nment of the Mississippi capitol com\nmission shows that up to the present\ntime the sum of $734,709.39 has been\nspent for work on the new state house,\natfd the balance left from the appro\npriation by the legislature available\nfor the completion of the work is\n$539,017.42.\nAt its meeting today the commis\nsion discussed the Jrreliminary ar\nrangements for the corner stone on\nthe 3rd of June. It is proposed to\nhold a big civic and military demon\nstration on that date, and the event is\nexpected to draw the largest crowd in\nthe history of the state capital. The\nentire national guard of the state\nwill be rendezvoused in Jackson dur\niug the exercises. The stone will be\nlaid under the auspices of the Ma\nsonic faternity.\nFoils a Deadly Attack.\n" My wife was so ill that good pbysi\ncians were nnable to help her," writes\nM. M.

It\nwas taken in 11*01 and worked very\nsatisfactorily, and then again in 1902,\nand the result is briefly told in the\nfollowing dispatch from New York:\nIt will be shown by the returns of\nthe various banking and trust compa\nnies that 1902 has been as profitable\nas 1901.

H. May at the Denechaud hotel\nthis morning. "There is almost un\nunlimited supply of lumber that has\nuever been touched all the way to the\nbay across to the Canadian border.\nAs yon know a great industry at the\nnorthwest is tlie mnuuufacture of fur\nniture. The price of lumber has been\ngradually appreciating now for many\nyears and it has abont come to the\npoint where it is impossible to get\nlumber for furniture outside of the\ni-outh and the state of Washington\nand some territory around this state.\nWe are shipping lumber from Wash\nington now to onr vicinity at the\nprice of $175 per car. Most of the\nfurniture lumber we are now using\nconies from the south, starts from\nMemphis. Thus it is that the fur\nniture people are very keenly alive\nto the situation and appreciate the\nfact that they must either get the\ntariff reduced or remove their plants\nto the south.\nAs there is more lumber in Canada\nthan in the south, and if the tariff\nwas reduced, then it could, by the\nbuilding of railroads, be brought to\nMichigan and Minnesota cheaper than\nfrom the south paying the freight.\nHence the organized movement to\nwards the removal of the tariff.\n"I do not believe that the removal of\nthe tariff" would injure the lumber\nresources of the south to any great\nextent, for after the tariff had been\nabolished the railroads would still\nhave to be built.\n"There is a constant flow of emi\ngration now from the northwestern\nstates into Canada as well as towards\nthe south, Many of the people who\nhave always lived in the cold north\nwest. seem to prefer going to Canada\nto coining south. That is largely\nbecause they have never been in the\nsouth and doubtless if some enterprise\ncould be originated here which\nwould bring large numbers of land\nhunters here that they w T ould desire\nto remain here. This is an idea that\ncould possibly be turned to good in\nLouisiana.\n"I do not think there will be\nany lumber left in Minnesota after\nthe next ten years worthy of the name\nand even now it has been pretty well\ncut in the near vicinity of the rail\nroads. In Minnesota, where the most\nof the furniture factories are loacted,\nthe timber is even scarcer than in onr\nstate. We believe, however, that if\nwe could have the tariff on lumber\nabolished that wo could gradually re\nplenish our forests by giving them a\nrest until the closest timber in the\nCanadian district had been exhausted.\nAt least that is the theory and nearly\nevery citizen in the northwestern\nstates is in favor of the tariff aboli\ntion proposition.\n"Onr representatives in congress\nand our senators are all working to\nthat end and because of the benefit\nthat such an abolishment wonld be\nto the building trades of the entire\ncountry I am told by our lumber men\nthat the movement is assuming very\nlarge proportions.\n"If the tariff is not reduced then\nall the furniture in the northwest,\nwhich means nearly all that is manu\nfactured in the whole United States\nwill be materially advanced in price.\n"The south is now manufacturing\nmore furniture than the country at\nlarge is generally aware of. Many\nof the southern furniture factories are\nthose which have moved from the\nnorthwest or have been started by\nmen who have been connected with\nfactories in that section, and, un\nderstanding the situation, determined\nto come south, seeing that the advan\ntages were greater than in any portion\nof the country.\n»>\nThe Pride of Heroes.\nMany soldiers in the last war wrote\nto say that for scratches, bruises, cuts,\nworn ds, corns, sore feet and stiff joints,\n^v-cklen\'s Arnica Salve is the best iu\n\'be world.
