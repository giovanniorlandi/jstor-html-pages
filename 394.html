O , Nov. 15.—There\nit danger of a aeriooa dash between the\nfederal authorities aud the 8tate of\nNevada. Some time ago the State ap\nplied for 10,000 acres of land under the\nl\\.rej Act, to be irrigated by the Pa\nciflo Reclamation Company of Nevada,\nWiib office* in Salt Lake City. At flrst\nm ,w land was Wanted, hot the Interior\nD partment engineer* reported there\nwal water available only for 10,000\ntf.-ea. Tbe Department therefore aet\nMide that area. Nothing dannted, the\nirrigation company bought from the\nState or private owner* 15,000 acre* ad\nj„*ot. It then proceeded to advertise\n, tf.OOO acre project under the auspices\nof tbe State and Federal Governments.\nInveatigation la Mad*\nTbe matter was called to the attention\nof Assistant Attorney General Cobb aud\nSecretary of tbe Interior Fiaher. An\ninfettigatiun showed that the amount\nof water had not increased and that\nibere was not half eooagh for 25.000\nicres. Tbe Interior official* took the\nview tbst tbe poblio could not be per\nmitted to suffer from the promotion\nicheme.\nWill Withhold Patenta\nUpon the recommendation ol Mr.\nCobb, Secretary Flatter eerved notice\nupon the ootupauy and the State of Ne\nvada that if the alleged misleading ad\nvertiaetuenla were not called in, neither\nthe oompany nor the State need expect\nthat the 10,000 acre* asked for under\nthe Carey Act would be patented by the\nGovernment. Uuder thla law the pal\nrat* are not granted nntll the work of\nreclamation la finished by private\niwrtles, with the State\'s approval.

This action resulted\nfrom tlie recent report that the market\nvalue of these hoods is ooly 92.\nPostmaster Genual Hitchcock to\nnight said no depositor would endanger\nbis principal by exchanging bis postal\nsavings deposits lor postal savings bonds.\nToe postal savings Ai t anthorize* the\ntrustees to withdraw at any time 3d per\noent of postal savings funds on deposit\nfur investment in United States bonds.\nIt was this provision that enabled the\ntrustees to offer to buy the pustal savings\nbonds, which hearS\',, per cent Interest\n"The only basis for the report of an\nactual sale of postal bonds at 92," said\nMr Hitchcock, “was an offer the other\ndav by a New York broker to purchase\n92-10,000 of the bonds below par, which\nwas uot accepted by the holder."\nMr. Hitchcock pointed oat that the\nfirst is*ue of bonds, H5 per cent, was in\nthe registered form, allowing that the\npurchasers intended to retain them as\npermanent investments.\nRUEF’S GREAT OPPORTUNITY\nMach is being said about tbe repent\nance of Abe Huef, of bia contrite heart,\nhis resolve to sin no more aud logo about\ndoing good if set free from prison.\nBut has he offered to give op or ac\ntually disgorged any of the money be\ngot by extortion, bribery, corruption or\nother vicious means? asks the Sac\nramento Bee.\nHas he given auy evidence for indict\nment aud prosecution of rich bribers in\nSan Kranoisco, or revealed any of the\nmany secret things lie knows that\nwould help to purge that oity of cor\nruption, to justify the graft prosecution\naud expose such men as Bat Calhoun in\ntheir trn* light ?\nUntil Huef doea th. se things, thete\nit good reason to believe his professions\nof reform are uot made in good faith.\nCripple Creek Taps Water Flow\nTbe mam water courses lying under\nthe Cripple Greek district, which have\nb.-itied turning engineers fur years and\nmade deep mining impossible, aud\nwhich were the g< al of tbe Roosevelt\ndrainage tunnel that has been in prog\nress of boring since 190. were tapjed\nla-t week.

Bnt wbat I am interested in\nknowing is what are yon making ont of\nit. It\'s the net that is interes\'ing in\nany business proposition. If the in\ncome of a business is $30,000 a year and\nthe net profit is 10 per cent, or $3000,\nthe owner is not as well off as the man\nwho has an income of $20,000 and is\nf IO.OoO to the good at the end of the\nyear. He has hsd more than twice the\namonnt of worry, work, risk and\ntrouble aud is not so well off as the $20,\n000 man.\n"The man who fixes his gaze on a\nbig volume of holiness rather than on\nthe amonnt of net profit is on thin ice\nand liable to a plunge that will bring\nhim op with icicles on his whiskers.\nIf yon are making 10 per cent net on\nyonr bu-in- ss, just bear in mind that\nevery dollar you out off of your ex\npenses is added in its entirety to yonr\nnet profits, w hile the amonnt yoo add\nto yonr sales increases yonr profits to\nthe extent of ouly 10 per ceut of the\nwhole.\n“I came into contact with a man who\nhad an investment in his business of\n$70,000, and with his big oorps of clerks\nand heavy expense he was netting less\nthau 10 per ceut on his investment\nIn going over his books I found he had\nuo salary charged up for his own ser\nvices as manager, and so asked him\nhow much he supposed be could enru\noutside. He replied he was sure he\ncould get $60 a week, and when I de\nducted this $2600 from big profit, the\nnet profit on the $70,000 investment\nwas less than the same sum would earn\nif invested in good bonds.\n“He called in the anotioneer and\ntorned ilia\' stock into a lit\'le less thau\n$60 ,000 cash. llo rented a smaller\nstore, luvested $10,002 in the business\naud pottlie rest in safe securities, aud\nat the end of the year was betier off by\n$3000 thau he had beeu the last year\nhe conducted the big busmess. This\nwas his cash advantage—tbe advantage\nin comfort, peaoe of mind, freedom\nfrom worry and danger of a nervous\nbreakdown were worth ten times that\namonnt to him.\n“He had learned the lessons of look\ning to tbe net and ignoring the gross.\n“This applies with equal force to the\nman on a salary. It is not a questiou\nof what he is making that constitutes\nhis success—i\'.\'s a question of what he\nis saving. The amount of money be\nhas iu the savings bank or other in\nvestments at the end of the year is\nwhat he has earned. The question of\nbow lunch has come in duriug the year\nis a inatier of not tb% slightest conse\nquence. The gross earnings don’t\namount to a picayune when lined up\nalongside the net, which is what be\nhas saved,”\nStatistics gathered by an exper ac\nooantaut from the books of a promi\nnent department store show that a\nfamily which has an open account iu a\nstore will spend 17 per oeut more money\nthan it did before the account was\nopeued and it paid cash. These figures\nallow for 10per cent of the goods bought\nfor cash beiug carried home at tune of\npnrcliase as the statistics were gathered\nfrom the delivery slips.\nThis accounts for the fact that from\ntime to time financially good families\nare solicited to open accounts at the\nlarge stores. It is not generally known\nthat every family in each city is rated\nby a local commercial agency, which\nbears the same relation to the city that\nDun or Drudstreet does to the oouutry\nat large.\nIf a family leaves one eud of the city\nand moves to the opposite eud and\nleaves an unpaid grocery bill behind,\nthat family will be surprised at the dif\nficulty it will have opeuiug au acoonnt\niu the new neighborhood.\nIts repntatiou precedes it.\nIt it were more generally understood\nibut every merchant is in constant oou\nu action with one central credit bureau\ndaily asking information and giving the\nnames ol those who fail to pay him, the\npublic at large would be more careful\nin paying bills. No matter who you\nare, your credit is listed and vour rat\ning based on your past promptness or\nuegleot.\n••The clink of the ice in the pitcher as\nthe boy comes down the hall” never\nmade one-half as mocb rnusio as the\nswish of the scissors catting the first\nooopou off the first bond.\nTwo American born Chinese women\nhave registered as voters in Oakland,\nCal It i» said they are the first of their\nI race ever to register.\nSEEDLESS LEMONS GROWN\nDiscovery at San Bernardino May Mean\nRevolution in the Citrus Industry\nThe seedless lemon, which botanical\nexperts have unsuccessfully labored to\nproduce for many years, has been dis\ncovered at San Bernardino, California,\nIts discovery has greatly interested fruit\ngrowers throughout the State as a revo\nlution in the lemou industry is expected\nto result.\nThe bud wood from whioh the trees\nnow bearing the seedless lemons have\nbeen grown came from a sample pro\nvided by the Department of Agriculture\na number of years ago, having been\nlabeled “citron of commerce,”\nInstead of citroD, however, tbe trees\nare bearing seedless lemons.\nTbe original bnd came from Italy,\nbut according to officials of Ibe Depart\nment of Agriculture a search of tbe\ngroves of tbe old world failed to reveal\nany trees whioh bear seedless lemons.\nFrnit men believe the character of the\nfrnit was changed through bndding.\nTwelve trees, all of which grow lem\nons witbont a sign of a seed, form\npart of a grove owned by I. E. Bash.\nGovernment experts have pronounced\nthem the only seedless lemon trees\nknown to exist in the entire world.\nAiming at the elimination of the er\nror* that now creep into the registry\ndepartment, the Postoffice Department\nhas adopted a new 10 oeut stamp for use\non registered packages. The new stamp\nis of a light blue shade, and of abont\nthe seme size as the special delivery\nstamps used by the department\nHeretofore when a package was to be\nregistered an ordinary 10-cent stamp\nwas added to the regular postage\naud the package registered at the\nregistry window. Persous unac\nquainted with the postal regulations\nmerely attached the extra stamp to the\npackage aud dropped it into the reoeiv\ning boxes, iu this way packages in\ntended to go by registered mail were\noften overlooked and sent throngb the\nregnlar mails.\nBy the adoption of the new stamp\nthis feature can be eliminated and the\nregistry department can be conducted\nwith a higher rate of efficiency.\nB tween 30 000,000 and 40,000,000\nbushels of wheat lie buried and worth\nless under a foot of frozen snow on the\nprairies of Western Canada, according\nto the estimate of Winnipeg grain men.\nEUREKA LODCE DIRECTORY\nEareka Temple No 15, Pythian Sisters\nMeets the First and Third Mondays of each\nmonth at the K. of P.
