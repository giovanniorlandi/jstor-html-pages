Such was the statement of\nthe Goldfield jurist before the assembly while that body was sitting as\na committee of ihe whole. Somers was somewhat riled over the consid\neration of the bill that allotted Nye a portion of land, supposed to be\nwithin the confines of Eameralda. The land in question adjoins Tonopah\nto the southwest and has long been afforded police and fire protection\nfrom this city without Goldfield, or Ksmeralda county being required to\npay for the same.\nThe departure from the usual judicial demeanor, as observed in the\nremaining Nevada judges, who happen to be of the self respecting sort,\ncame as quite a surprise to those who are not acquainted with the Gold\nfield jurist. The bulldozing tactics of Somers also surprised the assembly\nand probably accounted for the easy passage of the bill after he had\nconcluded his characteristic address. This same attitude might aiso\naccount for the denouncement of Somers by William Forman. tly Tono\npah attorney, who is chairman of the assembly judiciary committee. For\nman, in language that could not be construed as being uncertain, inform\ned Somers that he t Somers I was a disgrace to the bench and should be\ndisbarred by the legal profession ftf Nevada. Forman also informed Som\ners of several other things, but as this paper passes through the I\'niied\nStates mails, the appearance in print of Forman\'s opinion of the Goldfield\njurist would prohibit the issue of reaching outside subscribers.\nFrom reports that have reached Tonopah from Carson, the attitude\nof Forman with regard to the statements of the Goldfield jurist found\nconcurrence in the minds of the majority of the members of the legis\nlature. It is assured that the sober-minded public of Tonopah resent the\ninsinuations of Somers, wherein the people of this county are character\nized as knaves and thieves, and the frank statement of the Tonopah at\ntorney with regard to the mental calibre of Somers is given double ap\nproval. Attempts have been made in past years to bulldoze the legislature\nand such actions have always resulted disastrously. It has always been\na person of the Somers type that has attempted such methods, but the\nover-pempous, overbearing, condescending attitude does not seem to ap\npeal to the law makers. As a rule the members of the legislature are\ncompetent to judge for themselves and to also do their own thinking, and\nattempts by individuals to usurp such powers is naturally resented.\nProbably the next time that Somers, or a person of his type, appears\nbefore the legislature, he, or they, will purchase a ten cent copy of a\nmanual of politeness in demeanor, and eliminate the rough stuff, such as\nis always apparent in the pose of the ignorant and arrogant. Somers has\ndisclosed his true S\'-lf in the eyes of the Nye county public, although his\ndisgraceful actions might have endeared himself to the Ksmeralda vot\ners. It is doubtful though, that such actions on the part of an occupant\nof the bench will result in approval by the fair-minded public, although\nduring a moment of excitement the over enthusiastic might appear to\nsanction such tactics, but during the period that follows, when time for\ndeliberation has been afforded, the thinking public will not hesitate to re\nverse Its opinion.\nAs Tonopah hag been classed as a community of crooks by Somers, It\nis but natural that the presence of the judge in question should not be\nrelished in this district, although common decency demands that he be\ntreated with respect should he visit our community. Tonopah is often\nvisited by lothesome characters and the people her have made the best\nof such occurrences. It is probable that the best will be made of a\nvisit by Somers, although it is assured that he will not be greeted by a\nreception committee as he passes through the city limits.\nThe actions of Assemblyman Forman in pronouncing" Somers as a\ndisgrace to the bench and a subject for disbarment are fully concurred\nin"uy the Bonanza. This paper is of the opinion that Forman did not\ntrifle with the truth lu his denunciation of Somers, and even then he con\nfined his remarks to a limited space. Had he been permitted to con\ntinue his remarks an interesting history of the past, present and future\ncould have been outlined for the district judge-lobbyist. Forman showed\nno fear in his arraignment, although he is an attorney by profession\nand occasionally might find it necessary to appear in the Goldfield\ncourt. He was fearlesB In his attitude and was fighting for a principle\nthat was right in every minor detail".\nIt is such actions as Somers that tend to belittle the bench and serve\nto remove the dignity in which a wearer of the ermine is supposed, to\nwear.

Out of 3S\nmembers there were but two who\ncame to this meeting. In view of this\nfact 1 take the liberty of sending my\nreport to you for publication, as I\ncannot help but. think there are many\nof your readers, as well as members\nof the society who will give it a re\nspectful hearing. Many of the points\nat issue are but differences of opin\nion to which we both are entitled,\nand since you gave them a hearing\nin last Saturday\'s paper, 1 thank you\nfor allowing me to be heard as Miss\nMartin\'s defender. 1\nTo the Tonopah Branch Equal Fran\nchise Society of Nevada:\nAs It is permissible for a minority\nreport to present anything that may\nthrow light upon the reason the mi\nnority voted as it did, 1 beg to pre\nsent to you the following account\nof the proceedings at Ueno, from the\ntime I arrived there until 1 left.\n1 had heard of no friction between\nMiss Martin and her followers until\nI met Mrs. Tallman in Keno. She had\nhad some conversation with Miss\nFelice Conn of Carson, who had told\nher of trouble and that a fight over\nthe presidency would follow at the\nconvention. She had arranged for\na meeting between Miss Cohn and\nmyself and herself for the following\nmorning. At that meeting Miss Colin\nmade the following representations:\n1. Miss Martin had interfered with\nMiss Cohn\'s committee work at the\ntime of the passing of the suffrage\nbill.\n2. She was overbearing to those\nwho work with her.\n3.

When the train caine\nin we left Miss Martin and rode\ndown with the Carson delegation to\nThomas where we had lunch and a\ncaucus. On the way down, Mrs.\nThomas and Mrs. Donnelley asked\nme if I would run for president. It\nwas absolutely a surprise to me and talk in the morning, and it seemed\nand I would not decide hastily. 1 j to me that she was eager to tell\nreasoned that If Miss Martin was\'of the legislative committee work\nantagonizing people as Miss Cohn and Miss Martin\'s bad tactics, ac\nsaid, I might be of service to the cording to her, before a vote should\ncause by accepting the presidency, be taken for president, as it would\nbut I made up my mind I would wait i help to hurt Miss Martin\'s chances\nuntil 1 should hear what those had I of being re-elected,\nto say who had worked closest to j During all Miss Martin\'s address\nMiss Martin.

I fold\ntier or the trouble brewing and the\ncharges made against Miss Martin.\nshe said she had worked with Miss\nMartin so much and found her so\nfair and square and reasonable that\nshe could not believe the charges\nthat she overruled her committees\nor wnrully antagonized people. At\nmy request she joined the caucus at\n1 nomas and tried to combat the any measures passed bv this legis\ncharges brought against Miss Mar- Mature which would be brought up\nMiss Cohn maintained at this cau\ncus that Miss Martin. If elected to the\npresidency, would fight for a special\nelection for the suffrage amendment,\nthat this would be suicide to the\ncause; that Miss Martin would work\nfor It whether the society voted for\nit or not; that she would not be\nguided by the will of the organiza\ntion and that she should be defeated.\nDuring this debate 1 seconded Miss\nWilson\'s claims for Misg Martin\'s\nhonesty and disclaimed my own abil\nity to take her place. At last Miss\nCohn said: "Well, if Mrs. Brown\nfeels lhat she is timid about under\ntaking this, I think we ought to go\nback lo our original candidate, Mrs.\nFreudenbiirger."\nIn my talks with Mrs. Thomas. 1\nfound that she agreed thut Miss Mar\ntin was the only logical candidate\nand would probably be re-elected.\nand that they did not have enough\nvotes alone to elect me. My infer\nence was, of course, that they antici\npated that I might draw some votes\nfrom Washoe county away from Miss\nMartin. The more I thought of this\nand talked about It, the more It be-\nI\ncame plain to me that I was to be\nused by Ihene ladles as a whip to\nrebuke Mis-s Martin, with no honest j\ndesire on their part w hatsoever to \'\nsee me in the chair If they had been!\nsincere they would have let my can\ndldacy be known and have given\nmy friends in Washoe and other\nplaces a chance to rally to me, in\nstead of proposing my name two\nhours before the convention opened,\nus a dark horse.\nI have forgotten to mention that\nMiss Cohn wrote out the names of\nher own delegates in Mrs. Tallmau\'s\nroom while we were talking, and\nwhen we discussed the validity of our\nown credentials we decided to wire\nto Tonopah for them, which we did.\nrequesting that Mrs. Zeb Kendall\nalso be seated as a delegate from\nNye. Mrs. Kendall was then on her\nway over from Carson to attend the\nconvention, and while I had no au\nthority to send for her, I did so,\nbecause Miss Martin had said she\nwould like to have her if possible\nand Mrs. Keeler had agreed to send\nher if it was allowable. Not realiz\ning that the credentials of the con\nvention were to be inquired into\nstrictly, and knowing that Miss Mar\ntin\'s idea was to bring together as\nmany interested people as possible,\nand not knowing Mrs. Kendall had\njoined the opposit ion,\' 1 included Mrs.\nKendall\'s name in the request for\ncredentials, and they came before the\nconvention opened.\nAccording to the state records we\nwere only entitled to two delegates.\nEvery other county was represented\naccording to the state records, and\nthe validity of their delegates vouch\ned for by the amount of money to\ntheir credit in the state treasury,\nexcept ours. Ormsby county paid in\n$13 that morning and thus qualified\nand seated their delegates. That\nnight they stopped payment 011 the\ncheck.\nNo word that I can remember was\nsaid about proxies by Miss Cohn 01\nany of the ladies who were at the\ncaucus. These ladies were, beside\nthe Ormsby county delegates and my\nself:\nMrs. Horsey from Lincoln county;\nMrs. Stickney from Lyon county,\nMrs. Kendall and Mrs. Tallman from\nXye county.\nDuring the next hour I took occa\nsion to get as much information\nabout Miss Martin and her policy and\nher work as 1 could from my friends\nIn Washoe, and after 1 got into the\nj convention 1 asked my friends there\n! order of business," handing me the\nconstitution. For the life of me I\ncannot see now, nor could I Bee then.\n! how those rules applied to the an-\nnual meting. They are plainly for\nthe executive committee and are\nused there every two weeks, and I\ntold Miss Cohn so, and said that I\nj had never been to an annual meeting\n)0f any thing that, did not have a\n: nrnwM.mt \' \'AiivMiA This incitloilt\nrecalled to my mind Miss Cohn\'s\n! ed to push a\nmatter until It is dis-\n\' covered to t\nred to be bad policy or impos\nsible. It was appsrent from her re\nport that a special election must be\nabandoned by the advice of such\nmen as Assemblyman Cole, Senators\nNewlands and I\'lttman. Governor Od-\ndle, etc., and that when Miss Martin\nhad rifKcnvered that fUip could not\n\' obtain a special election, she wrote to\nI Mr. Cole asking If there would be\nbefore the people at a special elec\ntlon, to which the suffrage amend\nment might be attached and also\nsubmitted. It Is this letter to Mr.\nCole upon which Miss Cohn bases\nher assertion that Miss Martin fras\nstill trying for a special election\nafter she had been advised to, give\nIt up. I believe this Is a false con\nception of the letter to Mr. Cole.\nFalling a special election. Miss Mar\ntin, as a good advocate, looked up\nthe next possible position for the\nbill which would be of course any\npossible special election. Failing this,\nthe school election or the primaries\nwould be the next position, and It Is\nupon these that she is iiuv working,\ntrying through the ndvice of Jrdge\nNorcross, Attorney General Thatcher\nand the judiciary committee of the\nassembly to decide which Is the\nbetter time.\nAt the time that I rame to the\nconvention Mrs. Horsey told m she\nhud six proxies. She received those\nby telegraph between 1 and 2 o\'clock.\nThis looked like sharp tactics to me.\ntor 1 Knew sue did not have those\nwnen I naa left her at 1 o\'clock. She\ntold me later that they had been\n\' telegraphed to Carson and were de-\nlaved In being sent to her at Keno. 1\nwondered how strong that made them,\nfor 1 did not know how many they\nhad In view of all the things that\nto allow my name to go up.\nAt the cloBe of Miss Martin\'s ad\ndress. Miss Cohn asked that the con\nvent! in stick to the order of busi\nuehs as provided by the constitution.\nMiss Martin stated that the order\nof business had been made out by\nthe executive committee and that the\nrequest was out of order. Miss Cohn\ninsisted, and at last, as you know,\nappealed from the decision of the\nchair Miss Martin refused to put It,\na grave mistake, but she maintained\nMiss Cohn out of ordor from the\nbeginning and refused to be annoyed\nby Bomeone who seemed scheming\nto make trouble. I admit Miss Mar\ntin was wrong in denying an ap\npeal, \'but she certainly was right in\nmaintaining that Miss Cohn was out\nof order.\nThe credentials committee proceed\nings are too well known to need re\npeating. The proxies were allowed\nthey could not be denied. They\nwere there In what looked good\nshape. It was up to that convention\nto decide whether they should be\nused. Nothing allowed them in the\nconstitution we had no precedent ex\ncept that of the national convention\nrulings, which prohibited them. Miss\nCohn had asked Miss Martin 10 days\nbefore in Carson if they were to be\nused, and she said it was up to the\nconvention to decide, that they were\nnot allowed by the national and that\nno effort would be made by the ex\necutive committee to get them. Miss\nCohn sent a cal lto as many counties\nas she could reach asking for them,\nknowing that no official call had been\nsent out for them. Iliave since\nfound that one of the proxies she\nhelped to get, one held by Mrs.\n.Stickney of Lyon, was secured from\nMrs. Coryell, who was not even an\nappointed delegate, and only a mem\nber of Elko county branch, which\nhad sent no representation.\nI did not want to see Miss Martin\nbeaten, for I was convinced the op\nposition to her was led by personal\nantagonism, and I did everything I\ncould to down the proxies, for I was\nafraid they would beat her, and be\ncause I was convinced in my own\nmind that they were not obtained\nfairly.\nAs to the state officers voting, I\ndon\'t know why they should have\nbeen allowed to vote, but they had\nbeen asked by the executive commit\ntee, with the desire to have as many\ninterested people present as possible.\nMiss Cohn knew they were going to\nbe there and vote, for Miss Martin\nhad told her she need not consider\nMrs. Hray of Carson as a delegate,\nfor as she was a slate officer she\nwould vole as such. Miss Cohn took\nadvantage of this information to elect\nanother delegate from .Ormsby. Does\nIt not strike you as strange If her\nmotives were good, that she did not\npoint out these defects before too\nlate, rather than take advantage of\nthem to her own good, , and then\nkick about them afterward? ,\nTo my mind, the alternates from\nWashoe county were duly elected.\nThe Washoe county branch was duly\norganized and had a perfect right to\ndecide for themselves the way their\nalternates should be elected they\nhave nothing to govern it in their\nconstitution, aud no precedent to go\nby.\nAnother point: The national con\nvention rules; one delegate for 10\npaid up members and one delegate\nfor every five or more over. This\nruling of the national convention\nwas followed by the opposition, but\nwhen a national convention ruling\nagainst proxies ruled against them,\nthey would not accept it.\nThe opposition accuses Miss Mar\ntin of railroading and stuffing that\nconvention. To my mind she abso\nlutely did not. It happened that the\nconvention followed her, which for\nher was good luck, for she had made\nno plan of action and the opposition\nhad a very definite one, and two\nclever parliamentarians to carry it\nout. To my mind the woman who\nobtained those proxies with the in\ntention of using them against Miss\nMartin, without letting those who\nsent the proxies know that they were\nto be used to down Miss Martin, is\nthe woman who stuffed the conven\ntion and tried to railroad It. If she\nhad been In good faith she would 1\nnot have been abusive on the floor,\nbut would have done all she could\nto straighten out the tangles instead\nof trying to make them bigger\nand afterward call a rump conven\ntion after having staid with the con\nvention up to the time of adjourn\nment. Two ladles from Washoe remon\nstrated with me for downing the\nproxies one apologized to me after\nward. She did not see the game they\nwere playing until I called her at\ntention to It, and she voted to down\nthem when she did see through It.\nThe other as soon as she did see\nwhat was doing, passed the word\nalong, and the convention voted to\ndown the proxies. 1 assure you\nWashoe county was unprepared for\nan opposition fight, and as for MIbs\nMartin having fixed beforehand those\n27 ladies who voted for her, it is Im\npossible and not true.\nAs to the resolutions, no vote was\nregistered by the opposition when\nthe president said: "If there Is no\nobjection, the committee will be so\nallowed," In answer to MIbs Wilson\'s\nrequest to be allowed to polish them\nip netore ttiey went to the legisla\nture. We did It In good faith and\ntogether went to Carson to deliver it,\nnopmg tnat by being there personally\nthe resolutions would be paid more\nattention to and not mumbled liiaud\nIbly by the clerk, as Is always the\ncase with unknown communications.\nYon all know the treatment It receiv\ned and why. Miss Cohn and her\nfollowers asked Mr. Horsey to have\nIt laid on the table, and as no sen\nator but Mr. Horsey knew what It\nwas, they voted It 00 the table will\ningly. Several of them told me later 1\nthey had been too hasty. Does It\nstrike you thut It was a big, broad\nspirit of loyalty to the cause which!\nmade these women take a course of 1\naction that they knew must be a re-j\nbuff to the cause and dignity of\nwoman suffrage as well as a person-1\nal rebuff to us? Why could they not \'\nhave worked with us instead of!\nagainst us? Most of you know Missj\nWilson all of you know me. Am I1\nISO unreasonable that I would have\nbeen deaf to reason? They\n, were bent upon show ing us their\npower their pow er to hurt whatever\n\' might be the result. I tell you 1\nI have no patience with those who\n; try to tear down instead of building\njup. We are all here seeking to learn\nj asking for something we believe\nI we have a right to we are all new\n!at this game, all prone to mistakes.\nWhy should we not stand together,\ncouncil and assist one another to\nfind just the right way to do a\nI thing, rather than try to checkmate\na move which was known to have\nbeen done in good faith, even though\nit waB not quite the best way to\nhave done it. If I had been sure that\nthat order was on the minutes, I\nwould have been tempted to go back\nto Carson and fight these ladies on\nthat Issue, but I was not sure and\n1 would not take a chance; when I\ndid find it on the minutes, other\nthings having come up. It was de\ncided that the matter had best drop.\nNow I admit there were many mis\ntakes In this convention made by\nMiss Martin, Miss Cohn, myself and\nthe others, and that the constitution\nis hopelessly faulty. It is not sur\nprising. No new organization could\npossibly avoid mistakes, but the call\nwas legal and the order of business\nwas legal, and no amount of unparlia\nmentary proceedings can make the\nconvention illegal. We have learned\nmuch much which will help us to\navoid similar mistakes in the future,\nand a committee was appointed by\nthis convention to redraft the con\nstitution. Now, why not stand shoul\nder to shoulder and admit our mis\ntakes by which we shall rise to a\nplace where we shall make fewer\njoin hands and study and learn and\nbe ready when next year comes, to\nput the work through in good shape.\nWe are no worse off now than we\nwere last year, and a new convention\nnow will do no good, because all the\ncounties will not respond. The coun\nties who are loyal to Miss Martin\nwill not answer the call and it will\nonly result In two organizations\nwhere there should be one. The fol\nlowing counties have passed resolu\ntions loyal to MIbs Martin: Esmeral\nda, Lincoln, Washoe, Elko, Lander,\nHumboldt, Storey. Out of 11 organi\nzed counties seven have voted to\nstay with the state society.\nAs you know, I am Miss Martin\'s\nadvocate. I did not know her when\nI went there, but I found her a culti\nvated gentlewoman, with a firm con\nviction of the right of woman to the\nvote a religion It lg to her, and she\nhas spent her time, her strength and\nher money to further the cause she\nbelieves in. She is heart and soul an\nadvocate and I assure you this sort\nof zeal can do more to further a\ncause than any number of parliamen\ntarians.
