        <pre>['Reviews 135 \nThe pamphlet is lucidly written, but the proposed ‘insurance’ scheme might \nwith advantage have been more fully explained. The statement that ‘if the \npopulation came to live on average ten years longer, this. . . would cause the \nwhole population to increase by one-tenth’ does not seem quite correct. \nC. D. R. \nPoisson’s Exponential Binomial Limit. By E. C. MOLINA. \n[Pp. 92 + iii. New York: Van Nostrand. Lithog. 1942. $2.75] \nIT is believed that theoretical developments in actuarial theory will cause the \nPoisson law, \nto be of increasing interest to those concerned with mortality, sickness and \naccident statistics. Thus Molina’s present collection of tables of the individual \nand cumulated terms of Poisson’s distribution, although designed for use in \nconnexion with quality control, may well prove useful to actuaries. \nThe standard tables of Poisson terms are Tables LI and LII of Pearson’s \nTables for Statisticians etc., Part 1; these provide six-decimal accuracy for \na = .1 (.1) 15.0 and five-decimal values for a = 1 (1) 30. Molina’s tables consist \nof seven-decimal values of the terms for a = .001 (.001) .01 (.01) .3 (.1) .4 and \nsix-decimal values for a = .5 (.1) 15.0 (1) 100. Even with a as large as 100 there \nmay be differences of a unit in the third decimal place from the corresponding \nareas of the appropriate normal curve. \nIt is well known that if individual function values are recorded on punched \ncards the standard six-counter Hollerith Rolling Total Tabulator can be plugged \nto print off the successive fifth differences at a rate of 1000 an hour. The reviewer \nused this method to check Molina’s tables of the individual terms from a = 40 \nto a = 100. In this range of values of a the fifth differences of the Poisson series \nonly amount to a few units in the sixth place of decimals, so that any error of 2 \nor more in the last place retained would have been located at once, and even \nerrors of a unit in the sixth place are very likely to have been detected. Some \n20 possible cases of last figure misstatement were tested and, with one exception, \nwere found to be the result of ‘forcing’ the last figure retained. The exception \nwas the ordinate at x = 53 with a = 62 ; the printed value is .027516, the true \nvalue to ten decimals being .0275154996. H. L.S. \nBirth, Poverty and Wealth. By RICHARD M. TITMUSS. \n[Pp. 118. Hamish Hamilton, 1943. 7s. 6d.] \nHAS infantile mortality in England and Wales improved more rapidly in the \nhigher or lower social classes Mr Titmuss considers that between 1911 and ? \n1930/32 the decline in infantile mortality has been steeper for Classes I and II\nthan for Classes III, IV and V; that the gradient of inequality has tended to \nincrease ; and that the infants of the poor are to-day dying in relatively greater \nnumbers than before the 1914 war. \nThe death rates in the following table (representing deaths under one year of \nage per 1000 legitimate live births, both sexes) are taken from the RegistiarGeneral’s\nDecennial Supplements on Occupational Mortality. Owing to differences\n', '136 Reviews \nin the classification of occupations the corresponding figures for 1911 may not \nbe strictly comparable. \nSocial class of father Death rate Death rate \nPercentage \n1921 1930/32 Decrease decrease \nAll classes (including unoccupied) 62 17 22 79 \nClass I (professional, etc.) \nClass II (intermediate between \n38 33 \n55 \nI and III) \n45 10 18 \nClass III (skilled workers) 77 58 19 25 \nClass IV (intermediate between 89 22 25 \nIII and V) \nClass V (unskilled workers) 97 77 20 21 \nIn order to obtain comparable figures for 1911 and 1930/32, Mr. Titmuss has \nselected certain clearly defined occupations within each class, and has obtained \nthe death rates shown below. \n5 13 \n67 \nSocial class of father Death rate Death rate I911 1930/32 \nClass I \nClass II \nClass III \nClass IV \nClass V \nDecrease \nPercentage \ndecrease \n55 32 23 42 \n90 47 43 48 \n110 55 55 50 \n104 58 46 44 \n160 84 76 48 \nIn both the above tables it will be seen that the fall in the death rate, given in \nthe fourth column, was least for Class I. The fall for Class V was three to four \ntimes that for Class I, and, generally speaking, the lower the class the greater \nthe fall. Looking at the proportionate falls in the last column, between 1921 \nand 1930/32 these were greater for Classes III, IV and V than for Classes I \nand II. Over the longer period from 1911 to 1930/32, no marked difference \nin the proportionate falls is apparent between the higher and lower classes; the \ngreatest proportionate fall was for Class III. \nThese results hardly confirm the author’s statements mentioned above. It \ndepends, of course, on what are meant by expressions such as ‘steeper‘, ‘gradient \nof inequality‘, and ‘relatively‘.But neither absolutely nor proportionately can \nit be said that improvement in infantile mortality was more rapid in the higher \nthan in the lower classes. In interpreting the statistics the author attaches great \nimportance to the ratios borne by the death rates for the different classes to the \ndeath rate for all classes combined; he overlooks the effect on these ratios of \nvariations in the relative numbers of children in the different classes. \nBroadly speaking it appears that over the period from 1911 to 1930/32 there \nwas a general fall in the death rates of between 42 and 50%, and it would seem \nthat there was probably greater proportionate improvement in mortality in the \nhigher classes during the first half of the period and in the lower classes during \nthe second half. It is to be hoped that the latter trend has continued and will \naccelerate until the worst has become equal to the best. Admittedly the large \ndisparities in infantile mortality rates shown in the above tables should be a \nmatter of serious concern. \nIn the course of his study the author examines the death rates for the first \nYear of life according to age at death in months, according to cause of death \n', "Reviews 137 \n(congenital or environmental), and according to district. It would be interesting \nto know whether the statistics on which the occupational death rates are based \nare in any way biased by errors in the returns; for instance, occupation of father \nrecorded at birth of child differing from that recorded at death, or child recorded \nas illegitimate at birth being recorded as legitimate at death. \nSince 1930/32 there has been further improvement in infantile mortality rates, \nthough the war caused a setback. But we have a long way to go yet before we \ncan compare favourably with the rates quoted by Mr Titmuss for certain other \ncountries, e.g. Holland with a rate of 37 per 1000 for 1936/38. C.D. R. \nThe Advanced Theory of Statistics. By M. G. KENDALL. \n[Volume I. Pp. 457 + xii. C. Griffin and Co. Ltd., 1943. 42s.] \nNUMEROUS books on the methods of statistics have been published in recent \nyears. Besides works intended for the general reader there have been more \nspecialized texts to meet the needs of biologists, agriculturalists, doctors, \nengineers, economists and actuaries, respectively. The intended readers being \nfor the most part practical men inclined to stop at the mezzanine floor of the \nmathematical skyscraper, the development of the subject has been elementary \nand, for the most part, orthodox. In fact, the authors themselves often make \nno pretence of having studied the highly advanced mathematical treatments \nwhich characterize recent advances in theory. \nKendall, however, is a polished mathematician and has set out to provide the \nfirst complete text-book on mathematical statistics. His wide acquaintance with \nEnglish and American (rather than Continental) literature is plain from the \nlists of references and valuable sets of problems at the end of each chapter. \nBut his very strength is also a source of weakness, for the historical develop- \nment of the subject as revealed by the successive volumes of Biometrika is \napt to minimize the importance of the theory of probability as an essential \nmathematical and epistemological point du départ. That Kendall has been in- \nfluenced by this historical background is evident from his relegation of Proba- \nbility to Chapter VII, and his suggestion that this chapter can be read after \nChapter I if desired is no solution, for the reasons which induced him to adopt \nhis actual chapter numbering have implicitly affected his viewpoint throughout. \nAlthough in the reviewer’s opinion this is a misjudgment of the proper \nposition of probability, Kendall has written a very fine text-book on mathe- \nmatical statistics. The present work is the first of two volumes and forms the \nbasis for the more modern developments of statistical testing, estimation, \nanalysis of variance, etc., which are promised for Volume II. There are as \nyet no norms of the relative importance of the various portions of the subject, \nso the author cannot be blamed for showing that his interest lies with particular \nchapters. Of the sixteen in this book, the last, on rank correlation, is the longest \nand most original. \nFrom the point of view of the actuary anxious to learn something of modem \nstatistics two serious drawbacks present themselves. The mathematical know- \nledge required varies considerably from chapter to chapter: few actuaries will \nbe able to manage the important Chapter IV on Characteristic Functions, the \nresults of which are so essential to the understanding of some of the later and \neasier chapters. Furthermore, there is a good deal of ‘dead wood’ in the book: \nthe reviewer wonders when 'tetrachoric r’ and ‘biserial were last used in a \nstatistical analysis, and why a student has to face a whole chapter on ‘Association \n"]</pre>
