Shaw in the Dakota Farmer:\nIt is not easy to estimate the full\nvalue of trees on the prairie; in fart\nit is scarcely possible to do so. The\nfactors that bear upon this question\nare many and in some respects they\nare interminable, for their exact\nmeasure cannot be taken. It may be\npossible to reduce to dollars and cents\nthe value of trees grown and turned\ninto lumber, or of trees grown and\nmade into fence posts, but it is not\npossible to take the exact measure of\nthe value of the shelter which they\nfurnish to the homes, or of the belie\nbt which comes from tiie protection\nwhich they give to the fruit trees and\nfruits in areas which are encircled bv\ntrees. Nor is it possible to know just\nexactly how much benefit conies from\nthe birds that they provide homes\nfor.\nThe value of trees for lumber under\npraire conditions is not well under\nstood. The plantations put out for\nthat i urpose have been few. The in\nstances in which they have been har\nvested for lumber have been fewer\nstill. Hut there are a few instances\non record in which cottonwood trees\nmade into lumber have in \'j.j to :\'»(•\nyears made so much growth that the\nlumber obtained from them was found\nto be worth more than the value of\nall Ltlie wheat or grain that could\nhave been obtained from the land,\nhad these been grown on it for suc\ncessive years during the entire period\nin which it was occupied by the trees.\nIn addition considerable wood was\nalso obtained.\nThe protection furnished the home\nhas of course an exceeding value\nthough it cannot be measured in\ndollars and cents. Comfort in life is\nworth more than money without\ncomfort. The value of comfort can\nnot easily be measured, it is so high.\nThink of the difference in comfort of\na man whose home is encircled with\ntrees through which the storm cannot\nbreak or through which the cold, cut\nting, tierce, cruel winds cannot blow .\nThink of the difference which it\nmakes to the animals that are pro\ntected from its full sweep. There is\nsomething enabling and commanding\nin the thought that man may thus\nharness the silent f< rces of nature to\neffectively curb the fury of the forces\nthat are boisterous. Life must be\nshorn of many of its charms when\nthe inmates of a home have no pro\ntection from the fury of the winter\nwinds.\nThe value of trees in protecting\nfruit is very great. In some instances\nit means the difference between suc\ncess and failure in growing fruits.\nApple trees for instance will fail to\ngrow in places unprotected where\nthey w ill grow well under protection.\nEven though the trees should grow\nand thrive and bear in places where\nthe wind is strong the fruit in such\nexposures would be whipped off the\ntrees. There are places where rasp\nberries will not prove satisfactory, as\nwhere the strong sunshine in the\nspring is not kept away from them by\nthe shade of trees. There are many\nareas where strawberries unprotected\nwill not set runners properly, because\nof the action of the winds. When\nthe protection is furnished there is of\ncourse, no trouble from this source.\nThat birds will increase as groves\nincrease is a foregone conclusion.\nThat they should increase is greatly\nj to be desired. The increase of birds\nI means a corresponding decrease of\n! insect pests. Could the increase of\nbirds be made sufficient, they could\n! take care of the insects, or at least\n! many species of tnem, that harm the\n1 farmer. These enliven the groves\n, with their song. They are the friends\nj of the farmer and lie ought to give\n. them every chance,\nj There are other benefits that come\nj from the trees. They furnish shade\nj for live stock when the groves are\nI properly planted. This in itself is a\nmight consideration when mid-sum\nmer suns wax warm. They check\nthe force of the w ind in summer and\nbecause of this they exercise a salu\ntary influence on crop production be\ncause of the extent to which they\ncheck evaporation. When one con\nsiders the many benefits that trees\nbring to him who plants them on the\nprairie it is surprising that they are\nnot planted bv every resident who\nowns a farm.\nThousands of homes are going to be\nplanted on the prairies the coming\nseason, especially will this be true oi\nj\nI\nj\nj\n!\n!\nj\nj\ni\nI\nj\nI\n.\na\nbe\noi\nj Montana. The inrush of settlers into\nI that state is going to be beyond all\nj precedent in the settling up of the\nj state. It is important, therefore, as\n! to whore the buildings shall be placed\n! on these new farms, and as to how\nj they are going to be protected,\nj With refe rence to the placing of\nthe buildings, it should be near the\ncenter of the farm. This is impor\ntant, in fact it is of great importance,\nand yet its importance is apt to be\nover-looked. In nearly all instances, I\nthe lirai thought of the settler is to j\nbuild about as near as he can build j\nbeside the public road. This may \'\nmean that the buildings w ill be placed j\nwhere it is not possible to protect\nthem, because of proximity to the\nhighway. Of course a man cannot go\nonto another man\'s property to plant\na windbreak.\nThe w isdom of planting near the !\ncent-r of the homestead or purchased :\nfarm will beat once apparent when\nit is remembered that every day that\nwork is done in the fields the journey i\nfrom the steading to the tields must j\nusually be made four times a day, in\ncluding the going and coming. If the\nsteading is at one side of the farm\nthis will mean the loss of much time\nas compared with w hat would be lost\nif the steading were placed in a cen\ntral position. Multiply this daily loss\nof time by all the working days of the\ngrowing season, and it means a very\nla rge loan. Multiply this again by\nlong years of fanning, and it becomes\na huge loss, larger than the farmer\ncan w ell afford to bear. Again I say,\nplant the steading if possible near the\ncenter of the farm.\nOf course the first year it may not\nbe possible to plant any trees with\nthe hope that they will do well, es\npecially in areas that are very dry.\nHut the ground may be prepared the\nvery lirst season. It may be broken\ni where the windbreak is to be planted.\nI It should be so broken. As much\nj labor should be put on the land as if\nI it were to be sown to wheat or other\ngrain. When thus managed the land\nis in good condition in the spring for\nthe planting of the trees. Such plant\ning should not be deferred. If the\nhomesteader is not able to plant on\nthree sides let him plant on two, and\nif he cannot plant on two let him\nplant on one. In this way protection\nwill be furnished in a very few years.\nIt may call for much attention to\nmake a success of the trees in areas\nthat are very dry, but success may be\nobtained. Of course much depends\non the variety of the trees. Willows\nand popniars are probably the most\nlikely to succeed. Hut of course they\nmust be given cultivation and of the\nmost careful kind, not only the lirst\nyear but for several years following.\nThe importance of thus securing pro\ntection early out on the open prairie\ncannot be over-estimated by the new\nsettler.\nIt is not enough to have trees. It\nis possible to have a large area of\ntrees and yet they may not furnish\nmuch protection. Almost everything\ndepends on tin* way in which they are\nplanted. Hecause of this it is pos\nsiblefor a comparatively limited area\ndevoted to trees to furnish more pro\ntection.\nIn planning for the planting of the\ntrees, the aim should be to so plant\nthat when they grow annoying w inds\nwill be kept at bay to the greatest\npossible extent. Annoying winds may\nnot mean simply cold winds, but also\nI long winds that are not cold. In a\nprairie with winds that have a wide\nsweep, it may be the part of wisdom\nto have the trees run all around the\n"leading, that is all around the set of\nbuildings and to have enough of space\nalso enclosed for the planting of fruit\ntrees to sutlice for the needs of the\nfarm. IManting thus may limit the\nview, but even so, would it not be\nbetter to have a limited view and\nprotection from winds than a wide\nview and a lack of protection?\nI\'sually the protection should run\naround at least three sides of the en\nclosure. The fourth side, that is the\nside that is left open, if it is left\nopen, wiU not always be the same,\nliiere is a difference in localities.\nMore commonly, however, the east\nexposure may be left open with less\nharm from winds than any other.\nThe other three sides should be pro\ntected, not forgetting tiie south, for\nusually the winds that blow from the\niCumniuc.l • -\'ll\nC.

Whether\nthe publication is emit rolled by south\nern railroad interests or oilier corpor\nation holding inimical to Montana,\nilocs not concern: no doubt hut that\nthe publication is doing the lies\', pos\nsible to earn its thirty pieei s, from\nwhatever source, in the knocking of\nMontana. However, tlie people of\nMontana take tiie Collier brand of\ndisapproval at its real worth, and no\none is at all worried thereby. Tin*\nfollowing pertains to the Collier\nboost :\nGreat Falls, dan. 2.\'», into\nEditor, Collier\'s,\nNew York City. N.

For the last six months\ntiie lilings at the Great Falls land\nollice have averaged close to a thous\nand a month and there are yet live\nmillion acres of land in this district\nopen to entry. There are thousands\nof acres of Carey act irrigated land:\nthousands of acres of Reclamation\nservice irrigated homesteads and\nthousands of acres in the stock\nranches about to be cut up into farms.\nThese lands are awaiting the farmer.\nTwo years ago, with one exception, I\nthere was not a grain elevator in tnis I\npart of the state: now Great Falls is I\nthe largest Hour milling center be- j\ntween Minneapolis and the coast and 1\nliiere are lour lines of grain elevators\nalong the lines of railroad radiating\nfrom thiscity. There must be"speeial\ninducements" here or l ,<\'2* men would\nnot have tiled on homesteads in this\ndistrict during the past month. The\nspring months will snow double that\nnumber.

Fuder the head of 1\n"Collier\'s Slam at Montana," the j\nCommercial West says editorially : ;\nGeorge L. Ramsey, president of the 1\nFnion Man iS: Trust Co. of Helena, :\nhas sent the following letter of pro- j\ntest to Collier\'s Weekly:\n"EditorCollier\'s Weekly : We wish 1\nto li le with you a protest against the 1\nunseemlv and course picture in your j\nissue of February r>, through tiie me- ;\nilium of which, as supplemented by :\nreading matter, you pilote a Montana\nbank president as saying:\n" \'In live years, no Montana cattle- 1\nman lias made money: tbe bank lias !\nloaned them to its sorrow,* etc.\n"This unwarranted and vicious at- 1\ntack upon a principal resource of the !\nstate itas brought to Montana and its\npeople much harm, and w e cliallange\nyou to give the name of the bank\npresident to whom you lia ve referred.\n"The writer has had business rela\ntions with Montana cattlemen during\nthe last 25 years, and the cattlemen\nwith whom we have dealt have made\nmoney and the business with us has\nbeen very satisfactory, their borrow\nings being less than usual and the\npresent amount of their indebtedness\nbeing unusually small; in fact, so lit\ntle at this time, that we look with\nmuch satisfaction upon the prosper\nous nature of the business."\nAs Collier\'s is the great champion\nof everything fearless in journalism,\nwe shall expect to see Mr. Ramsey\'s\nletter printed and the authority giv\nen for such a sweeping statement of\niinaneial loss to both ranchmen and\nbankers. Every winter there is a loss\nof stock during severe storms, but we\nhad never heard before that stock\nraising 011 Montana ranches was not\nprofitable; and surely the record of\nMontana hanks indicates good profit\non the loans made on stock. "Cattle\npaper" is considered an excellent as\nset not only in Montana but through\nout the west.\nWe have before us a statement of\nnine different companies operating\nMontana ranches, and the dividends\npaid during 1000 range from 10 to 20\nl»er cent. We have no data on the\ndividends paid by Montana banks,\nbut Mr. Ramsey admits profits for\nhis hank: and only this week we no\nticed an item of several new banks\nstarted in Montana by Minneapolis\nbankers. Montana must he all right.\nIt is up to Colliers to retract and\napologize.\nLuckily for Montana, neither Col\nlier\'s. nor any other muck rake com\nmodity, may do us harm, nor are any\nfavors asked of them.

Something was done in this\ndirection last season, but that was\nonly a preliminary skirmish to get\npeople informed as to the necessity\nof destroying tin* ever-present nest.\nThis vear tiie war is to lie waged\nmore extensively, if the plans of the\nAmerican Civic association are car\nried out. To make the reason for the\nwarfare clearer to the average mind\ntin* insect has been termed the "ty\nphoid tly," and it is proposed by the\nassociai ion to show to tin* people just\nwhat tin* fly lines and how he does it.\n, Lantern slides and moving picture\nlilais have been prepared showing him\nin action. The tly, large as a hen on\nthe screen, is shown trampling over\ndisgusting dirt and a lew moments\nlater in the dining room, lie is pic\ni tured in all stages of development\nand activity.
