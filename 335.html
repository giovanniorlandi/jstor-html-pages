T. JONES\nCand idate for Trea u rer of\nBolivar County.\nIn view of the fnct that one of my op\nponents, Hon. Fontaine Jones, of Hose\ndale. has withdrawn from the rncc for\ncounty treasurer, and owing to the fur\nther fact that ns both of us nre named\nJones, there is liability of confusion in\nthe minds of the voters ns to which is\nstill in the nice, I have deemed it\nbest to Issue this statement to the voters\nof the county in order to clear up all\nmisapprehension in the premises. There\nfore I desire to state now that I am still\nin the race and shall remain until the\nprimaries have determined who shall\nbe the nominee.\nI am, and for severnl years have been,\na citizen of Cleveland. I have been a\nresident and taxpayer of Bolivar county\nand tile deltn for the past 30 years. I\nhave never before been a candidate for\nany office, and shall not at this time\nseek the office of treasurer did I not feel\nmyself entitled to your consideration\nand fullv competent to discharge its du\nties. I am a native Mississippinn, hav\ning been born in Desoto county: have\nalways been a consistent democrat and\nhave never evaded a duty or shirked a\nresponsibility owing to my state, county\nor fellow men. Those of my family who\nwere able to bear arms went forth nt\nthe call of the Southland. Most of them\nfell on the field of battle; others return\ned home after the surrender onlv to suc\ncumb to wounds that they had received\nor to fall from the exposure and priva\ntions of the four years of conflict.\nAt an early period I was thrown up\non my own resources in the battle of\nlife and was bound out to learn a trade.\nBy industry and frugality I succeeded\nin amassing n little money, and this in\nvested in deltn lauds in this and Sun\nflower county, has been the ’source of\nmy competency. During all these years\nI have led an active life, doing whatever\nI was able to encompass a fair support\nand honest livelihood.\nI am seeking the office of treasurer\nupon the merits and not U|k>ii the de\nmerits of mv opponent. I am resort\ning to no subterfuges or misrepresenta\ntions. If I am elected I propose to give\nthe office a clean administration and the\npeople n fair deal. The present unfair\nness and injustice of the selection ot a\ndepositary for the people\'s ninnev will\nbe corrected it I am chosen treasurer ami\nevery sate hanking house in the county\nshall be given its share of the advanta\nges now and for years enjoyed by one.\nSince all these banks bear their fair\nshare of the burden of tnxatiou nnd\ntheir officers, directors and stockholders\nare citizens of the county, a sense of fair\ndess would suggest that all be treated\nalike. For the past eight years these\nfunds have been deposited in but\none bank, and in loaning them out there\nhas been practiced an unfair discrimi\nnation against other sections ot the\ncounty. It shall be my first duty, if\nelected, to arrange for a fair nnd equi\ntable distribution of the funds that\ncome into mv hnmls.\nIf chosen I shall turn over to my suc\ncessor a full, exact nnd true accounting\nof every dollnr that passes through mv\nhands, together with a detailed state\nmeat nnd showing from what source de\nrived and lor wlmt purpose expended.\nUpon this declaration of mv purposes 1\nask yeur support if you believe that I\nam right.\nVery truly yours,\nCleveland, July 1st 9. T. JONFS.\n■ - ■—9^^\nMRS. PAMELIA CABLE DEAD.\nOil Monday the spirit of this\ngentle and kind old lady passed\ninto the Great Beyond, after a short\nillness. She was the oldest white\nresident of Rosedale,being 95 years,\nof age, and by her gracious man\nner and many acts of kindness had\nerrpatlv endeared herself to the\npeople of this’city. She was the\nmother cf Mrs, A. C. Wilson and\nM. K. Wilson and W. B. Rofcberts.\nFuneral services were held at the\nMethodist church, in Camden,\nArk., Rev. Brownig, of Little\nRock, assisted by the . Methodist\nand Baptist ministers of Camden\nandr interment was made in the\nCamden cemetery.\nSCOTT AT BALDWIN.\nBaldwyn, Miss., July 12.—Hon.\nChas. Scott addressed a large and\nentusiastic audience at the opera\nhouse from 10 to 12:30 today. Mr.\nScott had the honor of having the\nlargest audience of voters OT^ny\ngubernatorial aspirant, and they\nhave all been here. He is a very\nlucid manner explained his views\nof all the issues of the campaign,\nespecially the immigration position\nwhich he explained to the satis\nfaction of all. At the close of his\nsplendid address the town and com\nmunity was aveiitable Scott hot\nbed,believing in a business ad\nministration pure and simple.\nOUR NEXT GOVERNOR.\nCharles Scott Will Lead\nby a Large Plurality\nOn August Jst.\nClins. Scott of Bolivar, saved tile Hav\nfor Mississippi at the Jamestown Expo\nsition.—Democrat-Courier.\nLet every old veteran in Lafayette\ncounty roll up liis sleeve and work lor\nCharles Scott. Wa can give him the\ncounty if we will do our duty.—Oxford\nEagle.\nEvery old vtteraniu the county should\ngo the polls on Aug. 1st and vote for\nHon. Charles Scott. He is your friend.\nPerhaps this will lie our last opportunity\nto put one of our number in the gover\nnor’s chair. Oi-d Veteran.\nScott\'s opponents now admit lie will\nbe in the second primary. To which his\nfriends assent, but add no one else will\nbe. Look to see him go in in the first\nprimary.—The Conservative.\nEvery davit looks more nnd more\nlike Scott will make the landing in the\nfirst peimary. Such couspicious ability\nand noble character is winning the day\nover nll^opposition of kinds. \'Rah for\nScott.!—The Conservative\nOf the 25 stale exchanges received\nat the News office, sixteen are for\nChas. Scott for governor, two are E. F.\nNoel, two forjudge Truly, nnd the oth\ner five non-committal. If newspapers\nreflect public sentiment and they certain\nly do, the lead of Hon. Chas. Scott is\nmost pronounced.—Ocean Springs News.\nNo wordy wind-jamming editorial is\nnecessary to strengthen Mr. Scott’s po\nsition on the important issues of the\ncampaign. He 1ms verv successfully met\nevery charge and explained fully his po\nsition to the entire satisfaction of mniiv\nwho have heretofore been counted with\nthe opposition in his speech lust night.—\nCorinth Herald.\nA presentation of lacts and figures\nconstituting the other side of the pro\nposition sometimes spoils a very plaus\nible story. The above was very ably\nand forcefully demonstrated by Hon.\nChas. Scott lust night in bis analysis ol\nthe various and sundry charges brought\nagainst hint during the campaign.—Can\nton Herald.\nHut. Chas. Scott spoke here at 10\no’clock this morning. Notwithstanding\nthe downpour of rain quite a number\nfrom the county were ltere mid it good\ncrowd assembled at tbe opera bouse to\nhear hint. Quite a itttntberof Indies were\npresent. He was introduced by Prof. J,\nC. Bell, after which lie spok.e for two\nhours concerning his enndacy. He was\ngreeted with applause frequently and\nheartily Muring his speech and gained\nmany new supporters while here. He\nspoke to Uniitown this afternoon.—The\nHome Journal\'\nSCOTT AT GUN TOWN.\nSpecial to tbe Herald.\nGuntowii. Miss., July 12.—Hon. Cltns.\nScott, caudate for governor, addressed a\nlarge and appreciative audience here this\nafternoon.\nTbe Baptist church was insufficient to\naccommodate the crowd. Many ladies\nwere in attendance and joined heartily\nill tbe frequent applause accorded the\nspea er. This is Mr. Seott\'s first visit\nto this locality. After bis speech lie was\ngreeted by many new supporters who\njoined his former fi ends here is express\ning their approval of his views. He goes\nfrom here to saltillo, where lie dslirers\nanother ad (Ires tonight.\nSTATE IMMIGRATION.\nEither some of the candidates for gov\nernor are very stupid or they take tbe\npeople of tbe state to be so, from the\nway in which they persist in stating, in\nthe face of llie facts, that Mr. Scott ad\nvocates flooding the state with dagoes.\nSome years ago Mr. Scott wrote un\narticle for the Mniudactnrers\' Record of\nBaltimore, in which he udvocathed\nwhite immigration to Mississippi, either\nsmal; fanners, tenants or laborers. In\nthis connection lie wrote that after\nspending some months in Europe in Eu\nrope investigating farm labor tbere, lie\nwas of the opiniou tlmt the Italian peas\nants of northern Italy were the best ma\nterial for our purposes. Tliey were ac\ncustomed to oi climate somewhat like\nours, were industrious and orderly and\nwould aiiiuke good tenants. This is the\nbasis of the “Dago Scare, that Truly,\nSissiou and Brewer try, to use the stam\npede the voters away Irotn Mr, Scott.\nIn his platform, Mr. Scott has noth\ning to sav on this question, not because\nhe does not believe in it as an industrial\nproposition, but because he knows it is\nnot a political question, and least of all\nu state political issue. He wants, and\nwe all want, to see a larger proportion\nof white men in onr state, provided,\nthey are of the proper sot.\nIll another place wc print an interesting\nsensible letter on ills subject from Mr.).\nC Walker, of Shaw, Miss.—Mal\'oa Bea\ncon.\nUNKIND POLITICS.\nThe five-to-one fight goes merrily\non, but Chas. Scott is so far ahead\nthat the scheme to work all kinds\nof plays against him serve to make\nhim stronger with the multitude.\nOne of the pays is to claim that he\nis for Williams or Vardanian, ac\ncording to the way the man who\nis being boned stands This is\nnothing blit a trick to beat Scott.\nRemember, theory of the five tfien\nis beat Scott! The slogan is “any*\nthing to beat Scott!”\nIf you want to vote for a man\nwho can give your State the best\nand most successful business ad\nministration—vote for Scott.—\nDemocrat and Courier.\nTHREE MUD-DAUBS VANISH.\nCharles Scott, leading candidate\nfor governor, on the immigration\nof an undesirable class of Euro\npeans into Mississippi, or any other\nclass of immigrants, has this to\nsay: “I could not if "I would, I\nwould not if I could. I am and\nalivays have been, unalterably op\nposed to on undesirable class of\nimmigrants. We should repel by\nevery means the importation of the\ncriminals, the degenerates, the\nfloatism and jestsatn of Europe.”\nThat closes up the smear of the\n“Dago” mud-ball thrown at the\npeerless Scott.\nAs to the railroads, Scott says,\n“I favor the proper regulation and\ncontrol of the railroads by national\nand state laws.” That wipes out\nthe slime of the railroad mud-ball.\nAs to the school funds of the\nstate, Scott, says: “I have a re\nre-distribution of the school’funds\nof the state and a greater propor\ntion of representation for a south\nern part than it how has. ” Thus\nvanishes the stain of the school fund\nmud-hall. Betclierlife the farmers’\ncandidate will be our next governer,\nno matter how many mud-daubs\nare thrown at him.—Summit Sen\ntinel.*\nHON. CHAS. SCOTT FOR\nGOVERNOR.\nAmong the number of excellent\ngentlemen and worthy citizens who\nare in the race for Governor there\nis certainly no one better qualified\nI for the all-important function than\nChas. Scott, of Bolivar county.\nWhile all the other candidates are\nworthy gentlemen. Mr. Scoct over\ntops his brother-aspirants for po\nlitical preferment by a full head\nand shoulders. In fact, he stands\nout premiuently, and has done so\nsince the beginning of the guber\nnatorial race, as the most thoro\nughly capable and best qualified\nman to hold this much-sought-after\nposition.\nThe most logical reason for sup\nporting Mr. Scott is because of his\nhigh character, his fearless integ\nrity, his dauntless moral stamina;\nbecause of his superiority in point\ni of intallect, intelligence and cul\nture; because of his proven busi\nness ability, the cool calmness of\nhis judgement and his unquestion\ntionable sagacity.\nHis experience and knowledge\nof men and things will undoubted\nly serve him in good stead in the\ngubernatorial chair and are certain\nly excellent recommendations. But\nhis popularity is due not so much\nto these qualities as to the true no\nbility of the character of the man.\nChas. Scott is not a mere money\ncretter not a inprr sordid material\nist; although he is a practical man\nof affairs. He lives for a higher\npurpose, with a nobler aim, and is,\nin a greater measure, endeavoring\nto live to true life. He is an un\nselfish nature, iooking forward to\nthe betterment of mankind. Hi s\nclean campaign and unquestionably\nopen and honorable methods are\nsimply above criticism.\nTnrough his high attainments,\nmagnetic personality and scholarly\nbroadness of view this man has enj\ntrenched himself in the hearts of\nthe best people throughout our\nState, aud with such support, such\nbacking, and such claimst his sup\nsupport who can dout that Chas.\nScott, of Bolivar county, |will be\nthe next Governor of the State of\nMississippi?—Sea Coast Echo.\n______\nDESPERATION.\nThe multi-tongue chase has after\nHon. Charles Scott has found an\nother yelp to add to\' its chorus,\nchanting in perfect unison its en\nmity to the leading candidate, but\nsinging, each in a different key,\nv\nwhen its individual interests is at\nstake. Harmony and fraternity in\nthe effort to defeat Mr. Scott; dis\ncord and . wrangling wh:ii it be\ncomes each man for hijnself. This\ncombination of opposing can\ndidates has discovered—or rather,\nimagines it has discovered— a new\ntune, destined to sing the requiem\nof the gentleman, who, to all un\nbiased minds, is several lengths\nahead in the race for Governor.\nReduced to a syllogism, the fa?\ntal charge is as follows: A horri\nble crime was, a few days since,\ncommitted iifLouisiana by Italians;\nbut Charles Soott favors Italian\nimmigration; therefore, he is a\ndangerous man and should be de\nfeated. This is the sum and sub\nstance of the accusation, stripped\nof its verbiage, amplification, re\npetion, fiery eloquence, denunci\nation,innuendo, and all other rhet\norical tom-foolery for which the\ncoalition has shown so marked a\npredilection.\nA little—just a little—refrence\nto facts will suffice to puncture\nand to let out the gas from this\nlatest anythiug-to-beat-Scott argu\nment. The criminals in the La\nmana case, one of the most hor\nrible in the annals of dibolical\ncrime, are every one of them, Si\ncilians, natives of Sicily, an island\nin the Meditrranean sea, belong\ning to, but apart from, Italy. The\ninhabitants of this island, who seem\nto be criminally disposed by birth\nand heredity,are known by the gen\neric name of Italians but are spec\nifically Sicilians, diametrically un\nlike true rural population of north\nern and central Italy, from which\nclass are to come the immigrants\noffered by Mr. Scott to replace the\nIndolent and vicious negro. The\nagricultural classes of northern and\ncentral Italy are known and noted\nfor tlieir industry,sobriety,honesty,\nthrift and morality, as is proven by\nthe criminal records of the Italian\ngovernment and by the testimony\nof those who have employed\' and\nhad dealings with them in Missis\nsippi and Louisana. And this is the\ntruth to which the “holy alliance"\nis more than welcome.—The Dem\nocrat Star.\nHE IS A WINNER.\nReports from various sections of\nthe state are very encouraging to\nthe friends of Hon. Chas. Scott,\nthat peerless Mississippian, who as\npires to the gubernatorial chair.\nHis high-toned and honorable me\nthod, of campaign is constantly\nwinning new friends for him, and\nhe is receiving ovations at many\nplaces. The majority of the peo\nple realize his superb qualifications\nfor the place, and will rally to his\nsupport. His high sense of honor\nhas been put to the test, and he\nhas proved his honesty in a way\nthat no other Mississippian has e\\\ner done. This is not meant to con*\nvey the idea that his opponents are\nany the less so, but they have not\nbeen put to the test that he has.\nMr. Scott is too honest to resort to\nany of the political schemes and\nunderhand methods that some of\nhis opponents have been engaging\nin against him, in order that he\nmight be governor. He thinks\nmore of his character than he does\nof any office within the gift of the\n! people, and that is the kind of man\nthat Mississippi needs for her chief\nexecutive.\nA vote for Scott means a vote for a\nman wose honesty is unquestioned\nin every way, whose undaunted\ncourage and backbone have been\nproved, whose business ability has\nb.\'eu demonstrated in many ways,\nwhose knowledge of law is indi\ncated by a large practice, whose\nevery quality is such that he would\ngrace the executive chair with dis\ntinction to the state and himself.\nThe little attacks that have been\nmade on him in regard to immi\ngration are too small and insigni\nficant to be noticed by honest peo\nple, and all know that they are\nmade simply to muddy the waters\nand fool the people. If the people\nof Mississippi elect Scott, they will\nnot make a mistake.—Newton Re\ncord.\n— ■\nALL THE WORLD\nknows Hint Ballard’s Snow Liniment\nhns no supeiior for Rheumatism, Stiff\njoints.

The dates selected are July 22d\nto 2fith, inclusive, or from Monday to\nFriday of next week. A much more\ncomprehensive program has been ar\nranged this year than ever before and\nthe list of premiums, as shown by the\ncatalogue, is several times larger than\nthat of last year. The government of\nthe fair has always been of the best,\nnothing of a rowdy or unlawful nature\nbeing allowed on or near the grounds.\nAn additional hotel has been erected\nthis summer, and it is believed that am\nple accommodations have been provided\nfor all who attend. The large attend\nance last year overran the facilities for\ncaring for it, and this action was thus\nmade necessary. There w ill be a general\ndisplay of agricultural, horticultural,\nstock, art, fancy work, domestic science\nand everything of interest to the people\nof Mississippi, the cash premiums offered\nnumbering several hundred and amount\ning to a large sum in dollars. In ad\ndition to the cash premiums there have\nbeen offered about 100 special prizes by\nthe business and professional men of\nthat section. The management confi\ndently expect double the attendance of\nlast year, which was in itself almost a\nrecord-breaker, and indications are that\nthese expectations will be fully realized.\nPresident Graham and Secretary Huston,\nas well as the entire management, are to\nbe congratulated upon the splendid man\nagement of the fair and the prospects\nfor its success. The Neshoba Fair is\none of the oldest in the State, and stands\nas an example of what can be accom\nplished if the determination to do is\nbehind the movement.\n• * *\nThe battle of the ballots rages in\nMississippi, and for the time being al\nmost all else is forgotten. I he cam\npaign being waged for places in the next\nState administration is the most aggres\nsive ever seen since the adoption of the\nprimary election law. In just two more\nweeks it will be over for a greater mini\nbcr of the places, and then after the\nthree weeks of skirmishing the people\ncan again settle dowm to business and put\ninto execution plans for bringing about a\n“Greater Mississippi.” It is necessary to\nhave these periods of discussion of State\naffairs every four years, the people profit\ning by the knowledge gained. £verv\nphase of State government is ably dis\ncussed from a thousand hill tops, and\nno man can say that he is ignorant of\nthe, methods pursued in conducting the\naffairs of State. It is a great educa\ntional campaign that if it was necessary\nto pay the speakers for the work, would\ncost multiplied thousands of dollars. And\nit all comes ah itely free, the teachers\neven paying t ir own expenses. Just\nsuch campaigns as these, with the at\ntendant publicity, insure to the sov\nereign citizens of our »State the best\ngovernment under the sun. Consider the\nmatter from this standpoint.\n* * #\nThis is the Chautauqua season in Mis\nsissippi. Several will be held during the\nnext three weeks and thousands of our\npeople will take advantage of the op\nportunity to spend a pleasant vacation\nand at the same time acquire knowledge\nof a valuable nature. The Chautauqua\nspirit is growing. It was only a year or\nso ago that Lake and Crystal Springs\nfurnished the only Chautauquas in this\nsection of the country, but nowr we have\nseveral more and the attendance in each\nrase is all that could be desired. It is\ngratifying to note these facts, that our\ngood people are liberally patroniizng\nhigh grade entertainments; that cheap\nvaudeville and abbreviated skirts do not\nappeal to them as in some sections of\nthe LTnion. In the Chautauqua we have\nthe very best platform talent, both en\ntertaining and instructive, giving some\nthing of value to all who assimilate it.\nEncourage the patronage of such whole\nsome entertainments and the events will\nmultiply in the future in a way that wdll\nbe gratifying.\n* * •\nKeep an eye out for the professional\npolitical liar at all times, and more es\npecially just on the eve of the primary;\nIt is regrettable that such vermin infest\nour State, but if they are here, arrange\nto counteract any devilment that may\nbe attempted. Under our laws all men\nare guaranteed a free ballot and a fair\ncount. Exercise the privilege of voting\nand watch out for those who might at\ntempt to influence the same by unfair\nmeans. It is a sacred privilege that\nshould be properly exercised.\n# * *\nThe Farmers’ Union continues to build\nwarehouses. The papers of the State\nbring to the front new applications for\ncharters every week. This is one of the\ngreatest movements ever started for the\nsensible handling of our great money\ncrop, cotton, and will revolutionize the\nbusiness if these establishments are\nnumerous enough to care for the surplus.\nPush the movement until every county in\nthe State will have one or more.\nNever make tears flow j God counts\nthem.—Alme. de Lambert.\nNine vhings there are of which the\nsuperior -nan should be mindful: To\nbe clear 11 vision, quick in hearing, gen\neral in expression, respectful in demean\nor, true in word, service and duty, in\nquiring in doubt, firmly self-controlled in\nanger, just and fair when the way\nof success opens out before him.\nMen speak of life as being a most\ndeep, profound and perplexing problem.\nIt is no such thing.

Life is tha workshop where,\nmen model their souls and in the even*\ning go home t« God.\nNext week, from the 23d t/> 2fith, in\nclusive, the Patron\'s Union will hold\nthe annual meeting at the grounds near\nLake. This is bj far the oldest fair\nand Chautauqua in Mississippi, and bears\nthe proud distinction of being one of\nthe most successful. It is now in its\ntwenty-fourth year, and is stronger and\nhealthier than ever before. The pro\ngram this year is especially well ar\nranged, including some of the ablest and\nmost prominent platform speakers and\nlecturers. The grounds, which have been\nowned by the association for a quarter\nof a century, have undergone a decided\nchange for the better. The track and\nspeed ring, which was temporarily pro\nvided last year, has been made good and\nwill prove as fast as any in the State.\nAthletic sports will be a prominent feat\nure this season, and healthy premiums\nare offered for oratorical contests am!\nexcellence in declamation. The manage\nment expects to see the largest attend\nance in the history of the association,\nand have every reason to believe that\nthese expectations will be realized. Pres\nident Bailey and Secretary Hamilton are\nworking energetically to insure the com\nfort and entertainment of all who at\ntend. It is a great old institution that\nfully deserves the unstinted co-operation\nand support of the people of that sec\ntion.\n• * *\nThe writer attended a meeting at\nColumbia recently called for the purpose\nof putting on foot a movement for the\norganization of a county fair and stock\nbreeders’ association A large number\nof representative cicizens from all sec\ntions of Marion county were present, and\nexpressed themselves as willing and\nanxious to join in the movement. Tem\nporary organization was effected with\nDr. Guy Hathorn as president and Mr.\nA. L. Smith as secretary. Marion is\nblessed with good land and everything\nnecessary to make it an ideal home. The\nneed there, as in all of the piney woods\ncounties, is for good white people to take\nthe cut-over lands and make them pro\nduce something of the world’s needs.\nThe object of the fair is not only to en\ncourage good peopAe to come and make\ntheir homes in Marion county, but to\nstimulate a spirit of friendly rivalry\namong those already there to try To do\nbetter in the future. It is a project\nthat is deserving of the support of all\nwho are interested in the fnure welfare\nof the county, and it is to be hoped that\nthe promoters of this enterprise will not\nallow it to die, but push it to a success\nfill termination.\n* # *\nSome months ago mention was made\nin this department of the amount of\ntruck sold from a single farm in Tip\npah county by Mr. K. B. Henderson.\nThe Ripley Sentinel of last week con\ntained another statement coming from\nanother farm that it was the intention\nof the writer to use this week, but by\nsome means the paper lias been mis\nplaced. At any rate, it was a showing\nif which any man might feel proud,\nbe he from any section of our great\nState. Tippah is one of the so-called\n‘poor hill counties,” but when it comes\nto raising stuff it sePtns to be right in\nthe lead all right. The truth is there\nare no poor counties in Mississippi, but\narc just what the people are plcasf*l to\nmake of them.\n# * #\nArrangements are being made by the\nI\'nited States Department of Aggricul\nttire to build several sections of sample\nroads in the Delta section of Mississippi.\nThis work will be done to show what\ncan he done to improve the condition of\nthe roads in that section, and is deserv\ning of the interest and co-operation of\nthe people in the district interested. Tile\nexample set is worthy of emulation. As\nhas been said dozens of times in t!(:s\ndepartment, the greatest needs of Mis\nsissippi today is better roads, and if\nI’ncle Sam is willing to give us object\nlessons in road building, we should take\nenough interest to see that the good\nseed sown are made to produce some\nthing in the way of results.\n* • «\nProfessional estimators are getting thu\npresent cotton crop down to as low as\n11,000,000 bales, if these figures are\nanything near correct the people of Mis\nsissippi should get twenty cents for ev\nery pound of cotton raised this year.

The\nMississippi department secured infor\nmation from the Boards of Supervisors\nat their regular meetings on the first\nMonday in July, and it would seem that\ntheir information, coming from five dis\ntricts in each county, should be approxi\nmately correct.\nIt is not what is outside of us that\ncolors our lives; it is what is inBide of\nns.

HOW the p«.int is, “grange” refera\nto the farmer, and it seems he had a\n“mania” (whatever that may lie) and\nthat he acted the fool about, twenty-five\nyears ago and let the politicians run his\nbusiness for him for a time. Ye*, T re\nmember something about it. You may\nnot, Mr. Editor, being, perhaps, a young\nman. (I have lived over half a century\nand was a voter over thirty years ago.)\nBut it was an actual fact. The politic\nians .actually got into the farmer\'s wa\ngon, rubbed soft sonp all over him, took\nup the lines and drove him over the\nsmoothest roads around Nashville, in\nsisted that they should take immediate\npossession of the State Capitol and all\nthe public offices (to lie filled by the\ndrivers). But while gaining speed and\nenthusiasm at every jump of the flying\nsteeds they realized the need of reinforce\nments and sped to the western division\nof the State, where more enthusiasm and\naid were secured. Then “on to East\nTennessee,” was the cry. And on they\ncame. But the speed had been so vio\nlent and the drivers (the politicians)\nso reckless that when the procession\nreached East Tennessee the steeds were\nweak and the farmer’s wagon worn and\nsqualling for “grease,” and not enongh\ncould be secured to onable it to proceed.\nThus the farmer was left. Politician\ntook to the woods. Farmer with a long\nface views the situation, and decides\nthen and there that his business is a\nbig business and that no politician is\ncapable of running it successfully and\nthat he must study and tninK lor nim\nself. And, to his credit he it said, he\nhas been doing so for several years. Ho\nnow reads a daily paper and looks after\nthe public welfare. He is represented in\nthe Legislature of the State and his voice\n\'is heard and his vote is used against im\nmorality, intemperance and oppression\nand for public schools, agricultural col\nleges, experiment stations, good roads\nand all kinds of public improvements.\nThe majority of our last Legislature was\nfrom the farming and stock lines of bus\niness. Many farmers were placed on\nimportant committees and if any act\nwas passed to the injury of the rail\nroads, we did not hear of it. Tn fact,\nCol. Robert Oates, of the L. & N., in\nhis address before the East Tennessee\nFarmers’ Convention at Knoxville, in\nMay last, complimented the Slate Leg\nislature (composed largely of farmers)\nand the farmers in general for their lib\neral attitude toward the railroads.\nAnd at the close of his address Pres\nident II. R. Clay thanked him in behalf\nof the convention for his expressed in\nterest in the farmers and assured him\nthat the farmers were not in favor of\nthe government ownership of railroads or\n“railroad ownership ot government.” M.\nV. Richards; who also made an address\nof great interest, as a representative of\nthe Southern, assured the farmers that\ntheir interests were considered mutual\nand not at all antagonistic. We will ad\nmit that the farmers were organized to\nsome extent and are looking after their\ninterests more closelw than formerly.\nYet, of the 1,000 members of the East\nTennessee Farmers’ Association, I do\nnot believe there is the least antagonism.\nWe do not, therefore, understand why\nPresident Finley should call on the “pa\ntriotic” and sound business men, such\nas bankers, merchants, manufacturers\nand promoters to organize against the\npoliticians who seem to be working the\nBO-called “grange mania.” The Tennes\nsee farmer may have, b*e» a fool once,\nbut that was long ago, and I assure you\nhe has learned much in recent years, and\nis doing much more reading and some\ndeep thinking for himself, and while he\ndoes not claim to have learned it all, he\nwill try to be fairly represented.\nII. L. REYNOLDS.\nVice President East Tennessee Farmers’\nAssociation, Dayton, Tenn.\nTo this communication President Fin\nley has written the following letter:\n“Washington, D. C., July 1, 1907. H.\nL.

I enclose\nhrrcwi‘h a ropy of my address to the\nhankers exactly as T delivered it. If you\nwill read it you will see that some one\nhas done me a grave injustice in at\ntributing to me any reference to the\n"grange mania,** or any language that\nran be distorted into a call upon any\nmen. or rlnsne* of men. to organize\nagainst the politicians who seem to I*\nworking the so-called ‘grange mania.\'\n“T shall lie glad if you will send ms\na clipping of the account, of my address\nwhlh so completely misrepresented me\nand so far misled you. Such an ac\ncount afford* a striking illustration af\nthe misrepresentation to which railways\nnnd railway manager* ha\\e been per\nsistently subjected in some quarters.\n"Not only in my address to the Ten\nnessee bankers, hut on other occasions,\nI have referred in terms of the highest\nappreciation to the work of the last Ten\nnessee Legislature, nnd the fact that a\nmajority of its members represented the\nagricultural communities of the State\nshows that T would have been most un\njust if I had criticised, in any way, the\nfarmers of Tennessee.\n"No one recognizes more clearly ths\nimportance of the agricultural interest*\nof the United States than doe* the man\nager of a railway operating in a region\nlike the South, the wealth of which is\nlargely based on farming. I know that\nthe railways of the South cannot pros\nper unless the Southern fnrmer is pros\nperous, and I l.elieve there are few farm\ners who do not realize that their pros\nperity depends in large degree upon the\nhighways over which their products must\nbe hauled to market.\n“I believe that every one doing busi\nness of any kind in the South is inter\nested in the railways of our section be\ning able to increase and improve their\nservice as rapidly as the demand for\ntransportation increases, but T do not\nbelieve that any other class is more vi\ntally interested in this than i* the farm\ner. He must rely .upon the railway to\n| carry to the consuming centers of this\nj country, or to the seaports for export,\nhis surplus products which cannot be\nconsumed in the immediate locality in\nwhich they arc poulticed. The railway\nalso makes possible the establishment, o^\nfactories and building up of tow ns and\ncities in agricultural communities. These\ntowns and cities furnish the farmer with\na nearby market for the perishable pro\nducts of his farm and enable him to di\nversify his farming to an extent that\nwould not l>e profitable if he did not\nhave the local markets to supply.\n“All my life I have numbered South\nern farmers among my friends. I know\ntheir high character and their high av\nerage intclUgcnce. T know that whan\nthey have studied the railway sitiua\n| tion from the viewpoint of abstract jus\ntice and from the viewpoint of their\nown individual interests, the railways of\nthe South will have no reason to fear\nunjust treatment at their hand*. My\nonly fear is that farmers and other\nclasses of citizens ns well may be mis\nled by false and mistaken statements as\nto the railways and their managers.\n“I have written you thus fully, in or\nder that you should have no mi-under\nstanding of my attitude a* to the prop\ner relations between the public and the\nrailways, and in order, especially. t«*\ncorrect the mistaken impression you had\nobtained as to my attitude toward the\nfarmer. I know that you will regret a*\nmuch as I do the way you have been\nmisled. Yours very truly,\n“\\V. \\V. FINTEY, President."\nEveryone tries to find happiness in\nlife. Some aim to become rich, in the\nhope of finding it, and when rich they\nlearn that they have added the misery\nof the dread of losing their fortune, and\nseldom find any contentment, much less\nhappiness. Others seek power and con\ntrol over men, only to find the respon\nsibilities are so great that they cannot\nfind ease, either for mind or body. True\nhappiness is seldom attained and only\npossessed by those who love God and his\nneighbor and obey the laws of God and\nof the State.\nThe truly good man is he who is not\nonly good in the sense of being efficiently\ngood for something, but who has God’s\nlove of others in his work.
