His reward is derision and the\nGrecian salute from the chiselers. Of\ncourse, he has the satisfaction of having\ndone his civic duty, and is held in honor\n1 ml esteem by his peers.\nWe are reminded of the election cam\npaign of last summer and fall, when we\nsee the way the Supreme Court battle is\nbeing fought.

Continuing its flight, it would\nfinally leave the sun so far behind that it\nwould appear to set in the east.\nA watch carried under either of these\nconditions might tell how long the plane\nhad been in the air, but would be of little\nuse in determining the time of day at any\ngiven point during the flight.\n1 ‘ GOT HOT” ON SLOTS\n(Tampa Tribune)\nA Miami collector, only 17, is in jail. Ho\ni-tole ox his collections to play the slot ma\nchines.\n‘‘l got hot on the slot machines, and couldn’t\nstop,” he said.\nHe lost his own money, then poured the coin\nof his employer into the .dots. Now he is a con\nfessed embezzler, en route to the penitentiary.\nWeak, you say? Of course. The “one-armed\nbandit” didn’t hold up this boy, force him to give\nit his money and his employer’s money. But the\nevil of the tlot machine is its convenience. It\nstands ihvitingly at every turn. It “lies in wait,\nwith lifted teeth,” as Joaquin Miller wrote of the\nsea Columbus crossed. It is a temptation, es\npecially to youth—and, worst of all, it is placed\nthere by the authority and with the protection of\nthe great state of Florida.\n, The case of the Miami boy should be con\nsidered by the Legislature, contemplating slot ma\nchine legislation—to keep them in or to put them\nout. Especially should the incident apply to the\npropc.uil to have the state itself operate the ma\nchines, become the robber of its citizens and visi\ntors. Would that be compensated by $10,000,000\nof revenue?\n“What would this revenue mean?” asks the\nMiami News. “The money played into slot ma\nchines would be a tax levied, not in direct propor\ntion to ability to pay, but in inverse proportion to\nability to think. This might be all right if no\nbody were affected but the individual with the\nlimited ability to think. But the tax would come\nout of his wife and children well as out of him\nself. If the time has come to educate some Flor\nida children with the money for other Florida\nchildren’s milk and shoes, then the time has come\nto keep the slot machines legal on the basis the\neasy money gentlemen suggest ”\nTHE KEY WEST CITIZEN\nYou and Your\nNation\'s Affairs\nThe Truth About Russia\nBy J.

Natu\nrally, these later works, especially\nthe former, have given great offense\nto the Soviet authorities.\nIn this connection an interesting\nstory is told by Sir Walter Citrine,\nwho was sailing to Russia in Septem\nber, 1935. He ‘ells of a copy of “Rus\nsia’s Iron Age” which an English\nlady was reading on the ship, which\nwas borrowed by some Russians and\nfell into the hands of the captain,\nwho was much displeased. He said he\nwas going to burn the book and\nwould like to burn the author as well.\nThis Sir Walter Citrine, an English\nLaborite, General Secretary of the\nTrades Union Congress, and President\nof the International Federation of\nTrade Unions, made a rather exten\nsive tour in Russia in September and\nOctober, 1935. and. although he knew\nlittle or nothing of the language and\nwas accompaniea by a guide and in\nterpreter. insisted on looking behind\nthe scenes and saw many things in\nvisible to the ordinary tourist His\ndiary has recently been published in\nLondon under the title, “I Search for\nTruth in Russia," and seems to be\none of the most reliable accounts of\nconditions in that country that has\nyet appeared, giving credit where\ncredit is due and yet fearlessly ex\nposing the seamy side of the Soviet\nUnion.
