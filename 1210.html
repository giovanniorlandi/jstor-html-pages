        <pre>['Calling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’\nThe strategic use of ritual references to the\nSpeaker of the UK House of Commons\nPeter Bull,1 Anita Fetzer2 and Dániel Z. Kádár3,4\n1 Universities of York & Salford | 2 University of Augsburg | 3 Dalian\nUniversity of Foreign Languages | 4 Research Institute for Linguistics,\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nPrime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) in the UK House of Commons is a ritual\nevent, governed by a cluster of conventions. Members of Parliament\n(MPs) must address their remarks to the Prime Minister (PM) through the\nmedium of the Speaker of the House, who is responsible for maintaining\norder during debates, and determining which MP may speak next. Due to\nthe sacred role of the Speaker and the prevalence of conventionalised conflict\navoidance between the PM and those who ask challenging questions,\nPMQs resembles archaic tribal councils, in which rights and obligations\nprevail. Yet, the importance of conventionalised indirectness and the sacred\nrole of the Speaker do not correlate with a lack of face-threats and challenges.\nPMQs represents an aggressive ritual setting in which the ritual roles\nand rules only offer a façade to package aggression, and indeed may operate\nas interactional resources whereby participants can even increase the efficiency\nof their verbal attacks. Thus, PMQs embodies a scene that ritual\nexperts define as ‘anti-structural’ in character: in this setting, the normative\nexpectation in daily life to avoid conflict is temporarily suspended, to such\nan extent that conflict has become the ritual norm and is regarded as quintessential\nto this parliamentary institution.\nKeywords: Prime Ministers Questions, the Speaker, face-threats,\nindirectness, conflict avoidance, unparliamentary language\n1. Introduction\nDespite the prevalence of ritual in so many political activities, there has been\nremarkably little research on the use of ritual language in political contexts (but\nsee Ilie 2010), even within areas such as discourse analysis (although see Gal, e.g.,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1075/prag.19020.bul | Published online: 22 November 2019\nPragmatics 30:1 (2020), pp. 64–87. issn 1018-2101 | e‑issn 2406-4238\n© John Benjamins Publishing Company\n', '1989). In the present paper, we aim to contribute to pragmatic research on interactional\nrituals through an analysis of practices and procedures in the context of\nBritish parliamentary discourse, with a particular focus on what is known in the\nBritish House of Commons as Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs).\nIn the United Kingdom, laws are passed by the House of Commons, which\nis supreme in legislative matters. The Prime Minister (PM) is answerable to the\nCommons and must maintain its support to stay in power. Every Wednesday at\nnoon while Parliament is sitting, Members of Parliament (MPs) have the opportunity\nfor at least the next half hour to pose questions to the PM on any topic\nof their choice in PMQs. From a theoretical point of view, what makes the discourse\nof PMQs relevant to pragmatics-based research on ritual is that it provides\ninsight into the operation of communal and institutionalised ritual practices. On\nthe one hand, PMQs operate within strict rights and obligations, and within an\ninstitutionalised veneer of public ‘civility’ (Smith, Phillips, and King 2010). On the\nother hand, PMQs is notorious for its adversarial language, variously described as\na form of “verbal pugilism” (Bull and Wells 2012), and even as a “bear pit” (Lees\n2015). For instance, in this paper we demonstrate that the phrase ‘Mr. Speaker’ is\noften deployed in attacks on the PM not to mitigate the face-threat but rather to\nindicate that a stronger face-threatening utterance is on the way.\nIn this introduction, we overview this dual character of PMQs, thereby to lay\ndown the foundations for a more detailed language-based investigation of the ritual–pragmatics\ninterface in PMQs. Note that we are not arguing that PMQs are\nalways hostile: as Murphy (2014) points out, politeness in a conventional sense –\nas a pragmatic tool by means of which the participants of an interaction manage\nto maintain relationships – plays an important role in many scenarios of PMQs.\nYet, due to our ritual focus, in this paper we pursue interest in the aggressive side\nof language use.\n1.1 PMQs: A ritual practice\nIn the House of Commons, the presiding officer is known as the Speaker, who\nchairs the debates, maintains order, and determines which members may speak.\nThe continuous history of the office is held to date back to 1376, to the reign of\nthe medieval English king Edward III (Roskell, Clark, and Rawcliffe 1993). At\nthat time, the Speaker was the MP chosen by the other MPs to quite literally\nspeak on their behalf, in particular, to communicate their decisions to the reigning\nmonarch. This was a dangerous business. Between 1399 and 1535 no less than\nseven Speakers had their heads chopped off. In modern times, this grisly history\nis reflected in a ritual whereby the MP newly elected to the office shows reluctance\nto accept it and is forcibly dragged to the chair by other MPs. Thus, the role of the\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 65\n', 'Speaker is not only institutionalised, but may also be seen in a Durkheimian sense\nas sacred (Durkheim 1912 [1954]) – as a semi-religious figure initiated into the role\nthrough a distinctive rite of passage (Johnson 2011), thereby endowed with particular\nrights and privileges, as well as with particular obligations. In the context\nof PMQs, the Speaker has in certain respects powers even greater than that of\nthe PM, for example, rebuking noisy MPs from either government or opposition\nbenches for excessive interruptions, barracking, and general rambunctiousness.\nImportantly, it is the Speaker who decides who gets to question the PM, and how\nlong the session lasts (recent controversies concerning Speaker Bercow indicate\nhow important is this power). While the PM has the ability to rebuke MPs who\nare being disorderly, it is only the speaker who is empowered to actually ‘do’ anything\nabout this.\nOne of the Speaker’s tasks is to preside over PMQs, the central British parliamentary\ninstitution and its highest profile parliamentary event. PMQs always\nbegin with the same tabled question to the PM, asking if s/he will list his/her official\nengagements for the day; thus, like any institutionalised ritual, PMQs are to\na certain degree ‘scripted’ or ‘demarcated’ (Staal 1979).1 The Speaker’s response\nto this question is also scripted, i.e. PMQs depart with a ritual sequential chain\n(Collins 2004). This initial ritual continues, as the called Member can then pose\na supplementary question (termed a ‘supplementary’) on almost anything that\nrelates to the PM’s general responsibilities or to some aspect of government policy.\nThe MP is limited to this one supplementary and cannot follow up the PM’s\nresponse with any further utterance (Harris 2001). However, this is permissible for\nthe Leader of the Opposition, who is allowed up to six questions. Often, only the\ninitial question regarding the PM’s engagements is tabled, although MPs can table\n‘Questions for oral answer on a future day’ which the PM would have notice of.\nBecause MPs have the advantage of putting supplementaries to the PM without\nnotice, PMQs have the important elements of unpredictability and surprise,\nand thereby, like any public ritual, also have a sense of drama (Turner 1967; 1992).\nOf course, this unpredictability only holds for the questions made by the Leader\nof the Opposition and other MPs who are supposed to oppose the PM – many\nof the PM’s own MPs provide notice (off the record) of what they are going to\nask. This dramatic character is liminal and a manifestation of what Turner (1967)\ncalls “anti-structure”, i.e. it represents a situation in which what people perceive as\n‘ordinary’ parts of social order are turned upside down. Thus, in many social situations,\nwe are expected to avoid conflict, strive for harmonious relationships with\nothers, and keep verbal conflict to the minimum possible. These social norms\n1. The second author would like to express her gratitude to Verena Weber, BA (University of\nAugsburg, Germany) for having re-edited the Hansard files.\n66 Peter Bull, Anita Fetzer and Dániel Z. Kádár\n', 'do not apply to PMQs, in which the exact opposite of these norms of social\norder is expected from the participants. Yet, whilst the social order gets jeopardised\nin PMQs, this jeopardy is intentional and normative – provided that it is\nkept within ritual boundaries – and it is exactly this paradox that makes PMQs\na prime example of liminal anti-structural ritual phenomena in modern societies\n(along with other liminal events, e.g. martial arts matches, see Kádár and\nHouse forthcoming). In the liminal setting of PMQs, the PM is not necessarily the\nmost powerful party (despite being the head of the government), in that the PM\nmay be subjected to an unpredictable series of attacks, and is expected to ‘hold\nground’, in a similar fashion to public speakers who get heckled (Kádár 2014).\nAlthough PMQs has been widely and extensively criticised (e.g., Thomas 2006;\nBlair 2010), it is arguably a remarkable institution, providing a notable degree of\npolitical accountability, whereby ordinary MPs have the opportunity to put questions\ndirectly to the head of the government.\nIn PMQs, there is an expectation that the dialogue should follow a questionresponse\npattern, just as in political interviews (Fetzer 2000). But unlike a broad-\ncast interview, questions in PMQs are posed by other politicians, not by interviewers.\nThis has important implications for the discourse which takes place. As\njournalists, political interviewers are expected to be more or less ‘impartial’, and\nthey formulate their conversational contributions accordingly, mitigating the facethreatening\npotential of their challenges with an appropriate degree of redressive\naction (Fetzer 2009). Politicians, however, are restricted in their communicative\nactions by no such constraints. In the British political arena, it is certainly not\na moral value to be ‘impartial’, but rather the other way around, it is part of the\nmoral order (Spencer-Oatey and Kádár 2016): MPs in PMQs can be as partial and\nas unashamedly partisan as they choose. Having argued thus, as Murphy (2014)\nnotes, backbench MPs still want to get work done on behalf of their constituents,\nand so this can lead to partisanship being set to one side. Yet, it is safe to argue\nthat MPs can behave in rather arbitrary ways in the PMQs, and they are protected\nby parliamentary privilege, which allows them to speak freely in the House without\nfear of legal action on grounds of slander. Thus, a second reason why PMQs\nmay be seen as ritual is because it embodies, in a sense, a distinctive moral order\n(Kádár 2017); what would normally be regarded as ‘inappropriate’ or ‘unacceptable’\nin other settings seems to be integral and self-evidently justified by the con-\nduct and procedures of PMQs.\nAt the same time, MPs cannot simply say what they like. They are expected\nto observe certain traditions and conventions regarding what is termed ‘unparliamentary\nlanguage’ (House of Commons Information Office Factsheet G7, 2004).\nSpecifically, they should not be abusive or insulting, call another member a liar,\nsuggest another MP has false motives, or misrepresent another MP. These ethical\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 67\n', 'conventions are enforced by the Speaker, who may ask a Member to withdraw an\nobjectionable utterance, and only the ritually sacred person of the Speaker can\nmake such an order. Over the years, Speakers have objected to the use of abusive\nepithets such as ‘blackguard’, ‘coward’, ‘git’, ‘guttersnipe’, ‘hooligan’, ‘rat’, ‘swine’,\n‘traitor’, and ‘stoolpigeon’ (House of Commons Information Office Factsheet G7,\n2004).\n1.2 Mediated address in PMQs\nAs argued so far, in PMQs, MPs must orient both to the expectation that the dialogue\nshould follow a question-response pattern and refrain from unacceptable\n‘unparliamentary’ language. However, within these constraints, they are still\nallowed a great deal of scope to attack and criticise their fellow MPs. In doing\nso, they may employ considerable ingenuity to remain within the conventions of\nacceptable parliamentary language. For example, the former Prime Minister Sir\nWinston Churchill once famously substituted the phrase “terminological inexactitude”\nfor the unacceptable term “lie” (House of Commons Information Office\nFactsheet G7, 2004).\nGiven that the ritual conventions of PMQs lead MPs to engage in language\nuse that might be described as ‘gamelike’ (see Turner 1967 on the close relationship\nbetween ritual and game), it also provides notorious interactional resources\nfor political point-scoring. Indeed, PMQs resemble a game because its participants\nare allowed to experiment with verbal techniques of aggression to win an\nupper hand (just as participants of group games such as British Bulldog, a football\nmatch, or a judo competition are allowed to physically do what is at their\ndisposal), but only within boundaries that ensure that no harm is caused beyond\nwhat is institutionally allowed. This resemblance to competitive sports (which are\nalways ritual by nature) was noted by the late Simon Hoggart (2011), the distinguished\npolitical columnist of The Guardian newspaper:\nPrime Minister’s Questions is increasingly like an unpleasant football match, in\nwhich the game played publicly is accompanied by all sorts of secret grudge\nmatches, settlement of scores and covert fouls committed when the players hope\nthe ref is not looking.\nPolitical point-scoring in PMQs has been analysed through qualitative analyses\nconducted by both Harris (2001) and by Bull and Wells (2012). Harris argued,\nbased on Brown and Levinson’s (1987) theory of politeness, that much PMQs discourse\nis composed of intentional and explicitly face-threatening acts (FTAs). In\nthe context of broadcast political interviews, three distinctive forms of FTA have\nbeen identified (Bull, Elliott, Palmer, and Walker 1996): threats to the party the\n68 Peter Bull, Anita Fetzer and Dániel Z. Kádár\n', 'politician represents, threats to individual face, and threats to what were termed\nsignificant others. The latter might be political allies (whose face the politician\nwould wish to uphold) or political opponents (whose face the politician might\nwish to attack). In PMQs, threats to individual face (in the form of personal\nattacks) have been shown to occur with great frequency (Waddle, Bull, and\nBöhnke 2019), based on the analysis of interactions between Leaders of Opposition\nand past five PMs (Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon\nBrown, and David Cameron). Similarly, Cameron’s successor as PM, Theresa\nMay, was shown to to make regular personal attacks on the current Leader of\nOpposition, Jeremy Corbyn (Bull and Strawson 2019).\nIllustrative techniques for performing FTAs in PMQs were identified by\nHarris (2001) – for example, asking disingenuous questions to which the questioner\nalready knows the answer. The intended perlocutionary effect of these\ndisingenuous questions was not to obtain an answer, but rather to reframe the\nquestion in another context, thereby deconstructing the opponent’s argumentation.\nA more systematic investigation of such techniques was conducted by Bull\nand Wells (2012), who identified six distinctive ways in which FTAs are performed\nin questions to the PM, and five ways in which the PM may counter FTAs in\nreplies. The term face aggravation (based on Goffman 1967) was utilised to refer\nto the aggressive use of facework, in which antagonists seek to score points at the\nother’s expense. Overall, Bull and Wells proposed that face aggravation between\nthe PM and Leader of Opposition is not just an acceptable form of parliamentary\ndiscourse, but it is both sanctioned and rewarded, a means whereby the Leader\nof Opposition may enhance their own status. They further argued that PMQs\nshould be regarded as another of the situations identified by Culpeper (1996),\nwhere impoliteness is not a marginal activity, but central to the interaction that\ntakes place. In this respect, it shows similarity with other – highly ritual – settings\nsuch as army training. Army training involves respect (towards officers) and rudeness\n(towards ‘rookies’), i.e. it provides a ritual scene in which aggression and\nrelated face aggravation is a central part of the interactional dynamics.\nThe prevalence of impoliteness and covert aggression (Archer 2008) operates\nin noteworthy contradiction to a number of ritualistic conventions governing the\ndiscourse of PMQs. In particular, MPs must address their remarks to one another\nonly indirectly through the medium of the Speaker. MPs must also refer to other\nMPs in the third person (rather than as ‘you’), and use formal and honorific titles,\nsuch as the ‘Right Honourable Gentleman’ or the ‘Foreign Secretary’. If breached,\nthese conventions are enforced by the Speaker, who may suspend an MP from\nsitting in the House. So, for example, a left wing Labour MP (Dennis Skinner)\nwas suspended from the House for a day (11 April 2016) because he persistently\nreferred to former Conservative PM David Cameron not as Prime Minister but\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 69\n', 'as “Dodgy Dave”, in relation to a controversy over Cameron’s personal tax affairs.\nThis act of suspension is referred to in parliamentary procedure as ‘naming’, once\nagain an example par excellence of the ritualistic character of PMQs. As Kádár\n(2017) argues, institutionalised ritual practices tend to trigger meta-definitions, i.e.\nin many lingua-cultures detailed regulations define how language users should\nbehave in institutional settings where rituals prevail. British parliamentary rituals\nare prime examples of this phenomenon, as illustrated above by our discussion on\nthe nature of rights and obligations at PMQs.\nIn the present paper, we define the question-response dynamic of PMQs and\nthe role of the Speaker as the simultaneous recipient/moderator of questions and\nresponses as ‘mediated address’. This term refers to the fact that, whereas in other\nsituational contexts the involvement of a mediator and the ritual interactional format\nmight suggest a high degree of formality and deference, in PMQs discourse\nthey are often combined with the strategic use of FTAs. Whereas MPs may be seen\nto observe their duty of being civilly ‘indirect’ by addressing one another through\nthe Speaker, this practice may not be indirect in terms of situated pragmatic operation.\nWhile Harris (2001) argues that these procedures serve to mitigate FTAs,\nthereby keeping the discourse within the bounds of acceptable parliamentary language,\nan alternative view is that in PMQs discourse they may actually work as\nboosters for FTAs.\nWhat makes this form of interaction so powerful is that it can cast a veil\nover brutal attacks. Thus, in the following example, David Cameron, then Leader\nof the Opposition, launched a wholesale assault on former Labour PM Gordon\nBrown (Bull and Wells 2012, 37):\nMr Speaker, for 10 years the PM plotted and schemed to have this job – and for\nwhat? No conviction, just calculation; no vision, just a vacuum. Last week he lost\nhis political authority, and this week he is losing his moral authority. How long\nare we going to have to wait before the past makes way for the future?\nIf Cameron’s comments had been addressed directly to the PM, it would make\nthis assault much more personal. Such a ‘personalised’ version of the above attack\nmight look as follows:\nFor 10 years you have plotted and schemed to have this job – and for what? No\nconviction, just calculation; no vision, just a vacuum. Last week you lost your\npolitical authority, and this week you are losing your moral authority. How long\nare we going to have to wait before the past makes way for the future?\nThis latter attack would be regarded as beyond the bounds of acceptable parliamentary\nlanguage, and certainly, Cameron would have been corrected for not\naddressing his remarks to the Speaker. Nevertheless, through the use of third70\nPeter Bull, Anita Fetzer and Dániel Z. Kádár\n', 'person language Cameron was arguably able to make a more damning indictment\nof the PM, whereby Gordon Brown is not addressed personally, but as object of\ntalk.\nSo far, we have overviewed the ritual characteristics of PMQs. We have argued\nthat, along with the sacred status of the Speaker and the dramatic/liminal and\nanti-structural nature of these clashes, the pragmatically most significant ritual\ncharacteristic of PMQs interaction is that it operates through mediated address,\ni.e., there is no way for participants to directly interact without the involvement\nof the Speaker who moderates the interaction in an ‘in-between’ role. Thus, the\nSpeaker holds ‘procedural power’ in this ritual game and is empowered to enforce\nparticipants to obey its rules.\nIn this context, the main theme of this paper is specifically on the ritualistic\nconvention whereby politicians in parliamentary debate may only refer to one\nanother in the third person through the channel of the Speaker. Notably, on some\noccasions, politicians will actually refer to the Speaker as ‘Mr Speaker’; the particular\nfocus of this paper is on what communicative functions are served by this\nexplicit reference. In the following section, we discuss the research methodology\non which our paper is based.\n2. Methodology\nPMQs provide MPs with the opportunity for backbench MPs to pose one question\nto the PM, while the Leader of the Opposition may pose up to six questions.\nThe data in this study were drawn exclusively from interactions between the following\nparty leaders:\n– The former Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labour Party (Ed\nMiliband) and the former Conservative PM (David Cameron).\n– The current Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labour Party\n(Jeremy Corbyn) and David Cameron\nThe focus on the leaders of the two main political parties can be amply justified\nin terms of the way in which their interaction has become increasingly central\nto PMQs. This has been substantively documented by Bates, Kerr, Byrne, and\nStanley (2014), who analysed the opening sessions of PMQs for five PMs (Margaret\nThatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron)\nover a 31-year period (1979–2010). For the period of their analysis, Bates et al.\nfound that the proportion of time taken up both by questions from the Leader\nof the Opposition and the PM’s responses had increased, that the Leader of\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 71\n', 'the Opposition tended to ask longer questions and more of them, and that, in\nresponding to those questions, the PM tended to produce longer responses.\nA preliminary examination of the interactions between PMs and Leaders of\nthe Opposition suggested that there are two major functions for which explicit\nreferences to the Speaker (referred to as Mr Speaker) are used in the discourse of\nPMQs:\nDiscourse organisation.\nSignalling conflictual situations (also referred to as critical incidents or critical\nsituations (e.g., Fetzer 2002, 2006, 2007).\nAs we will argue in Section 4, discourse organisation includes a set of situations in\nwhich referring to the Speaker as ‘Mr Speaker’ and the other ritual characteristics\nof PMQ sessions facilitate the efficiency of turn-taking and the organisation of the\nturn, and thereby the delivery of the politician’s contribution.\nThe function of signalling conflictual situations covers instances when the\nspeaker makes explicit tacit presuppositions in discourse (Fetzer 2002) – bringing\nthem back into the communicative exchange, making them noticeable or observable,\nand assigning them the status of a potential object of talk; thereby, the dis-\ncourse may be kept within the ritual boundaries of PMQs. The definition of a\nconflictual situation is based on the premise that the acceptance of a conversational\ncontribution entails the acceptance of the contribution as a whole, as well\nas of its presuppositions. The rejection of a contribution, by contrast, does not\nautomatically entail the rejection of its presuppositions. Should (some of ) its presuppositions\nneed to be rejected or blocked, the presuppositions need to be made\nexplicit in the first place; only then is it possible to negotiate their communicative\nstatus and reject or modify them (cf. Fetzer 1999). As a consequence of this, presuppositions\nare generally only explicated in conflictual situations. For instance,\nin a face-to-face interaction, the speaker hardly ever explicitly refers to her or his\nparticipation status as a speaker, and only explicates the communicative meaning\nof indexicals, such as ‘now’ or ‘here’, if communication problems emerge.\nAdapting Goffman’s approach of frame (Goffman 1974) to the analysis of conflictual\nsituations with frames involving “expectations of a normative kind as to\nhow deeply and fully the individual is to be carried into the activity organized by\nthe frames” (1974, 345), frame breaks occur when individuals act in dis-accordance\nwith those expectations. This concept of frame is particularly relevant in the context\nof ritual (see Kadar and House, in this issue). Frame breaks can be ignored or\nthey can be referred to in more and less explicit ways and thereby be assigned the\nstatus of an object of talk. A frame break is a necessary condition for assigning to a\nsituation the status of a conflictual situation. This has been demonstrated for references\nto the media frame in the topical-sequence section of political interviews,\n72 Peter Bull, Anita Fetzer and Dániel Z. Kádár\n', 'which are used to boost the pragmatic force of challenging the validity of genrespecific\nconstraints and requirements (Fetzer 2006); we assume that explicit ref-\nerences to the Speaker of the House of Commons have a similar function in\nparticular contextual configurations.\nMicro-presuppositions are anchored in a conversational contribution as such\nand triggered by presupposition triggers, e.g. definitive descriptions, factive verbs,\naspectual predicates, implicative predicates, or temporal clauses, while ‘macropresuppositions’\nspecify the discursive constraints and requirements of a\ncommunicative-activity-as-a-whole, such as the genre-specific turn-taking system,\nthe number of questions which the Leader of the Opposition may ask the\nPM in PMQs, or the use of unparliamentary language in PMQs. Those constraints\nand requirements can also be challenged, and their negotiation-of-validity\nprocess follows the same procedure as that of challenging micro-presuppositions.\nGenerally, explicit references to already accepted presuppositions serve as inference\ntriggers, signifying that the participants’ communicative performance has\nnot been in accordance with the discursive constraints and requirements of the\nactivity type, as we assume is the case with explicit references to the Speaker\nof the House of Commons in particular contextual configurations. While the\nexplication of micro-presuppositions initiates a negotiation-of-validity sequence\nwith respect to the participants’ rights and obligations, the explication of macropresuppositions\nhas the communicative function of a regulative device, calling for\n‘order’ and re-establishing the interactional equilibrium.\n3. Data\nOur analysis is principally based on two sets of data. The Miliband-Cameron sessions\nwere selected randomly; those between Corbyn and Cameron represented\nthe first 20 sessions following Corbyn’s appointment as LO.\n– 20 sessions featuring Ed Miliband and David Cameron (21 March 2012–10\nJuly 2013)\n– 20 sessions featuring Jeremy Corbyn and David Cameron (16 September\n2015–20 April, 2016)\nEach session features 6 question-response sequences between PM and Leader of\nthe Opposition, hence a total overall of 240 question-response sequences.\n– In addition, an illustrative example is included from an interaction between\nJeremy Corbyn and Theresa May.\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 73\n', 'The analyses were based on transcripts which are available from Hansard, the\nwritten record of parliamentary debates in the House of Commons. Hansard, it\nshould be noted, is edited, i.e., it is not a full verbatim record of parliamentary\nproceedings, nor is it intended to be – rather “substantially the verbatim report,\nwith repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes corrected,\nbut which on the other hand leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the\nspeech or illustrates the argument” (May 2004,260). Hence, in this study, transcripts\nwere also checked against delivery from video recordings of PMQs, which\nare available from https://www.parliamentlive.tv. These showed that for the most\npart references to ‘Mr Speaker’ are edited out, that is to say, they do not appear in\nthe Hansard record. It should also be noted, however, that verbatim transcripts of\nPMQs are not available on the Internet, so it is much quicker to re-edit Hansard\ninto a verbatim record, rather than make our own transcripts from scratch.2\nIn each session, instances where the politician referred to the Speaker as ‘Mr\nSpeaker’ were noted and coded according to whether they fulfilled a discourseorganising\nfunction or whether they signalled a conflictual situation.\n4. Analysis\nOverall, it was found that all explicit references to the Speaker could be coded as\neither discourse organisational or conflictual, hence the data were collapsed into\none table to allow sufficient observations for a 2 ×2 chi square. A Fisher’s Exact\ntest (one-tailed) was utilised, because the expected frequency of one of the cells\nfell below 5 (Siegel and Castellan 1988, 103–111). This analysis was not statistically\nsignificant, but given that the expected frequency in that one cell only just fell\nbelow 5 (4.9), a second analysis (Pearson’s chi square) was also calculated. This\ndid show a significant effect (p. <05), from which it was concluded that an interaction,\nwhereby explicit references to the Speaker were used more by the Leader\nof the Opposition in conflictual situations, was marginally significant.\nA number of illustrative examples are given below of how addressing the\nSpeaker can be discourse organisational, or conflictual.\n4.1 Discourse organisation\nDue to the ritual nature of PMQs, there are recurrent moments in the sessions\nwhen the Speaker is referred to as ‘Mr Speaker’. This is highly conventionalised\nand not in any sense conflictual. In the following example, the Speaker calls Jeremy\n2.

Kadar and Zhang 2019). This is\nthe case in Extract (2), in which Jeremy Corbyn first acknowledges the allocation\nof turn and thus the right to speak with the ritual expression of gratitude\ntowards the Speaker. This former acknowledgement is recurrent and ceremonial,\nso it is part of the ritual dynamics of the PMQs.

We can be\nvery proud of the numbers of people who engaged and took part in all those\n(Hansard HC Deb, 16 September 2015, col. 1037)debates.\nExplicit references to the Speaker may also serve simply to clarify as to who the\nintended addressee is. In the following example, Jeremy Corbyn pays tribute to\nthe late Gerald Kaufman, a former Labour MP whose funeral Corbyn had just\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 75\n', 'attended. He refers to a message from the Speaker which was conveyed by the\nrabbi at the ceremony.\n(3) He [i.e., Gerald Kaufman] was a champion for peace and justice in the Middle\nEast and around the world. Yesterday at his funeral, Mr Speaker, the rabbi\nwho conducted the service conveyed your message on behalf of the House to\nhis family, which was very much appreciated.\n(Hansard HC Deb, 1 March 2017, col. 277)\nIn this case, the explicit reference to Mr Speaker disambiguates the referential\ndomain of the second person pronoun of “your message”. It is notable that this\nis one of the few occasions that Hansard actually records the reference to Mr\nSpeaker (usually they are omitted), presumably to ensure that the text is intelligible\nto the reader.\nExplicit references to the Speaker of the House of Commons with a discourseorganising\nfunction have the function of accepting the macro-presuppositions of\nthe discourse of PMQs and thereby recognise the ritual character of the event.\n4.2 Conflictual situations\nHowever, as the data analysis above shows (see Table 1), explicit references to the\nSpeaker were significantly utilised in those contexts in which the Leader of the\nOpposition challenged the PM’s policies and deconstructed their argumentation.\nThe following two extracts are from PMQs (15 November 2015). Extract (4) is\nfrom the fifth question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, while Extract (5)\nis a follow-up question, realised as his sixth and final question in this particular\nquestion-and-response sequence. Unlike their discourse-organising functions,\nwhich usually occur turn-initially, if acknowledging turn allocation, or turnmedially,\nif disambiguating referential domains, the conflictual-situation sig-\nnalling function of explicit reference to the Speaker is also anchored in the turnmedial\nposition. However, it additionally requires a negatively loaded context,\nimbued by syntactic, morphological, and semantic negation, which is frequently\nintensified with adverbials or, in the context of PMQs, interruptions and other\nkinds of disruptive behaviour (printed below in italics). Frequently, the loaded\ncontext also contains quotations with a challenging force (cf. Fetzer and Bull\n2019).\nIn Extract (4), Jeremy Corbyn challenges PM David Cameron’s previous\nresponse to his request for information as not appropriate, using slightly attenuated\nsyntactic negation (“not absolutely sure”) boosted with an afterthought\n(“no doubt”). The explicit reference to the Speaker occurs in this negatively\nloaded context and indicates a transmission from the Leader of the Opposition’s\n76 Peter Bull, Anita Fetzer and Dániel Z. Kádár\n', 'comment on the inappropriateness of the PM’s answer while at the same time\nintroducing a chain of counter-arguments which deconstruct the PM’s argument\nregarding cuts to police numbers. In (5) the PM’s response is challenged, this time\nnot by the Leader of the Opposition himself, but rather indirectly through a quotation\nfrom an ordinary citizen (cf. Fetzer and Weizman 2018) directed towards\nthe PM. This conflictual situation is signalled by interruptions from other MPs,\nwhich are followed up by the Leader of the Opposition with an explicit reference\nto the Speaker and the ultimate challenge formulated as a yes/no-question (“Will\nthe Prime Minister be able to tell us” with the implication “or will he not?”). Both\nreferences to the Speaker index the macro-presuppositions of the discourse of\nPMQs, signalling that challenges with a strong pragmatic force may be forthcoming\nwhile at the same time appealing to the Speaker as a mediator that their for-\nmulation is in accordance with the constraints of the ritual exchange:\n(4) I am not absolutely sure where the money is coming from following the Prime\nMinister’s answer, but no doubt it will come. Mr Speaker, London has been\ntargeted by terrorists before, and this weekend’s events in Paris have focused\nattention not just on London but on other cities throughout the whole of\nBritain. Policing plays a vital role in community cohesion, gathering intelligence\non those who might be about to be a risk to all of us, but that is surely\nundermined if we cut the number of police officers by 5,000. Does the Prime\nMinister agree with the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir Bernard\nHogan-Howe, who said: “I genuinely worry about the safety of London if the\n(Hansard HC Deb 18 November 2015, col. 668)cuts go through on this scale”?\n(5) I have a question from a taxpayer, actually. His name is John and he says –\n[Interruption.] And he says, Mr Speaker, that at a time when we are experiencing\nthe greatest threats from terrorism ever faced, our police office numbers\nand their resources are being cut and he goes on to say that “Demands on the\npolice have been increasing steadily as budgets are slashed, increasing stress on\nofficers. Couple that with detrimental changes to their pay, terms, conditions\nand pensions, it’s no wonder that morale in the police force is so poor that 1 in\n3 are considering leaving the force.” Will the Prime Minister be able to tell us\nwhether community policing and other police budgets will be protected or not in\n(Hansard HC Deb 18 November 2015, col. 668)next week’s autumn statement?\nAccording to the official Treasury data, the Home Office’s overall budget fell from\n£12.6bn in 2011–12 to £10.9bn in 2015–16 (a real terms cut of 18 per cent). According\nto a House of Commons Library briefing, if one excludes staff on a career\nbreak or maternity/paternity leave, the true strength of the UK’s 43 police forces\nin March 2016 was just 118,779, the weakest since March 1985 (The Independent,\n5 June 2017). Given that following the general election of 2010, David Cameron\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 77\n', 'formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, both the above questions\ncan be regarded as attacks on government policy, specifically with regard to\ncuts in police budgets and in levels of staffing. In both instances, Corbyn prefaces\nthe attacks by referring explicitly to the Speaker.\nA further example can be seen in the following interchange between Jeremy\nCorbyn and Theresa May, in which he made an extensive attack on the government’s\nmismanagement of the NHS [National Health Service]. As has been the\ncase with Excerpts (4) and (5), explicit references to the Speaker are embedded in\na context imbued by syntactic negation (“cannot provide”, “not concerned”, “not\ngetting”), morphological negation (“unsafe”) and semantic negation (“so overstretched”,\n“lack of care”, “prevent”, “shortage”, “state of emergency”, “blighting”,\n“fewer”), and multiple interruptions. It is after these interruptions that the Leader\nof the Opposition refers explicitly to the Speaker, drawing his attention to this\ninappropriate form of interaction, thereby acting in discordance with the constraints\nof the interaction ritual:\n(6) Yes, let us look at the national health service and let us thank all those who\nwork so hard in our national health service, but also recognise the pressures\nthey are under. Today, a Marie Curie report finds that nurses are so overstretched\nthey cannot provide the high-quality care needed for patients at the\nvery end of their lives. The lack of care in the community prevents people from\nhaving the dignity of dying at home. There is a nursing shortage and something\nshould be done about it, such as reinstating the nurses’ bursary. Mr\nSpeaker her [i.e., Theresa May’s] government has put the NHS and social care\nin a state of emergency. Nine out of ten NHS trusts are unsafe, 18,000 patients\na week are waiting – [Interruption] Mr Speaker, I repeat the figure: 18,000\npatients a week are waiting on trolleys in hospital corridors 1.2 million often\nvery dependent – [Interruption] Mr Speaker it seems to me that some Members\nare not concerned about the fact that there are 1.2 million elderly people not\ngetting the care they need. The legacy of her government will be blighting our\nNHS for decades: fewer hospitals, fewer A&E departments, fewer nurses and\nfewer people getting the care they need. We need a government that puts the\nNHS first and will invest in our NHS.\n(Hansard HC Deb,22 February 2017, col 1016)\nCorbyn’s attack on the government record took place in the context of a report\nfrom the British Medical Association, according to which the NHS is “at ‘breaking\npoint’ with a decline in the number of hospital beds leading to delays and cancelled\noperations” (The Guardian, 20 February 2017). Notably, Corbyn’s attack\nincludes three references to Mr Speaker, and a further indication of its conflictual\nnature is reflected in interruptions from Conservative MPs.\n78 Peter Bull, Anita Fetzer and Dániel Z. Kádár\n', 'Extracts (7), (8), and (9) are from PMQs, 4 November 2015. They illustrate\nthe orchestrated interplay between the discursive functions of explicit references\nto the Speaker and their contextual embeddedness. The first explicit reference\nto the Speaker supplemented with an expression of gratitude has a discourseorganisational\nfunction, acknowledging turn allocation. This is followed up with\nan on-record challenge by the Leader of the Opposition, making explicit with a\nperformative (“I note”) embedded in a highly negative context (“not offered whatsoever”,\n“crisis”) the PM’s lack of responsiveness in his prior turn, which is acting\nin discordance with the discourse’s macro presuppositions of providing appropriate\nresponses to questions. The challenge is ratified by disruptive behaviour, com-\nmented on by the Speaker, calling for order in (8) and thereby making explicit the\ncode of conduct in the House. The Leader of the Opposition continues with his\nturn in (9), again with an explicit reference to the Speaker embedded in a highly\nloaded context imbued with syntactic negation (“will not answer the question”),\nsignifying a potential conflict, in that the PM is acting in discordance with the\nmacro-presupposition that he should provide appropriate answers to questions.\nThe reference to a negated hypothetical future action by the PM may count as the\ncommunicative action of a threat, in particular against the background that the\nLeader of the Opposition provides an answer to this hypothetical question with\na quotation from an expert source; this leads to another on-record challenge formulated\nas an either-or question:\n(7) Thank you, Mr Speaker. I note that the Prime Minister has not offered any\ncomment whatsoever about the winter crisis of last year or about what will happen\nthis year. [Interruption.]\n(8) Order. The Leader of the Opposition is entitled to ask questions without a barrage\nof noise, and the Prime Minister is entitled to answer questions without a\nbarrage of noise. That is what the public are entitled to expect.\n(9) Mr Speaker, if the Prime Minister will not answer questions that I put, then I\nquote to him the renowned King’s Fund, which has enormous expertise in NHS\nfunding and NHS administration. And I quote: “the National Health Service\ncannot continue to maintain standards of care and balance the books … a\nrapid and serious decline in patient care is inevitable unless something is\ndone.” May I ask the Prime Minister which is rising faster – NHS waiting lists\n(Hansard HC Deb,4 November 2015, col 959)or NHS deficits?\nExplicit references to the Speaker are not only produced by the Leader of the\nOpposition, but the PM also makes use of them, albeit less frequently. The following\nExcerpts ((10), (11), (12) and (13)) are from PMQs, 13 January 2016. In (11),\nThe PM is responding to a question from the Leader of the Opposition (10). In\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 79\n', 'that question, the Leader of the Opposition’s explicit reference to the Speaker is\nrealised in the initial position of his turn, which makes it a prime candidate for\na discourse-organising function. However, in this instance, the turn-allocation is\nnot supplemented with an expression of gratitude, as would have been the case if\nthe turn had been allocated by the Speaker. Furthermore, Corbyn’s explicit reference\nto the Speaker is embedded in a negative context and a quotation from an\nordinary citizen. For these reasons, it is assigned the function of signalling a conflictual\nsituation.\nThe same function is utilised by the PM in (11). Again, the explicit reference\nto the Speaker occurs in a negatively loaded context with syntactic negation (“not\ngoing to be able to deal with”, “is it not interesting”), morphological negation\n(“nothing”) a question (“isn’t it interesting, Mr Speaker”), which is repeated, and\ndialogically formulated challenges as conversational quotations along the lines of\n“I say – you say” which assign Labour the role of being “conservative” and thus\nthe party which is against changes and wants people to remain poor (“stay stuck\nin poverty”).\n(10) Mr Speaker, I notice that the Prime Minister did not give any guarantee to\nleaseholders on estates. I have a question to ask on behalf of a probably larger\ngroup on most estates. A tenant by the name of Darrell asks: “Will the Prime\nMinister guarantee that all existing tenants of the council estates earmarked for\nredevelopment will be rehoused in new council housing, in their current communities,\nwith the same tenancy conditions as they currently have?”\n(11) We are not going to be able to deal with these sink estates unless we get the\nagreement of tenants and unless we show how we are going to support homeowners\nand communities. Is it not interesting, Mr Speaker, isn’t it interesting,\nMr Speaker, to reflect on who here is the small “c” conservative who is saying to\npeople, “Stay stuck in your sink estate; have nothing better than what Labour\ngave you after the war.”? We are saying, “If you are a tenant, have the right to\nbuy; if you want to buy a home, here is help to save; if you are in a sink estate,\nwe will help you out.” That is the fact of politics today – a Conservative Government\nwho want to give people life chances, and a Labour Opposition who\n(Hansard HC Deb, 13 January, 2016, col 850)say “Stay stuck in poverty”.\nIn (13), the PM responds to the Leader of the Opposition’s fifth (penultimate)\nquestion of their question-and-response sequence (12). His explicit reference to\nthe Speaker is realised turn-medially, and as has been the case with all of the turnmedial\nreferences to the Speaker, their function is that of signalling a conflictual\nsituation. In (13), it is not a direct challenge about Labour’s policies but rather the\nclaim that Jeremy Corbyn owns a home. [Corbyn is referred to as the Right Honourable\nGentleman, in line with the House’s code of conduct]. This claim could be\n80 Peter Bull, Anita Fetzer and Dániel Z. Kádár\n', 'interpreted as a reference to the politician’s private sphere of life and thus as not in\nfull agreement with the macro presuppositions of the discourse of PMQs, thereby\nas not fully appropriate. Here, the explicit reference to the Speaker in combination\nwith the redressive action “let us put it like this” mitigates the force of claim and\nthe forthcoming challenge formatted as a question (a format which is the privilege\nof the Leader of the Opposition only) – “what is the Right Honourable Gentleman\nfrightened of ?”:\n(12) I hope that that word “hope” goes a long way, because research by Shelter has\nfound that families on the Prime Minister’s living wage will be unable to afford\nthe average starter home in 98% of local authority areas in England – only 2%\nmay benefit. Rather than building more affordable homes, is the Prime Minister\nnot simply branding more homes affordable, which is not a solution to the\nhousing crisis? Will he confirm that home ownership has actually fallen since\nhe became Prime Minister?\n(13) There is a challenge in helping people to buy their own homes. That is what\nHelp to Buy was about, which Labour opposed. That is what help to save was\nabout, which Labour opposed. Is it not interesting that the right hon. Gentleman\ndid not answer the question about the 1.3 million housing association tenants? I\nwant what is best for everyone. Let us put it like this, Mr Speaker. The right\nhon. Gentleman owns his home; I own my home. Why should we not let those\n1.3 million own their homes? Why not? What is the right hon. Gentleman\n(Hansard HC Deb, 13 January, 2016, col 851)frightened of ?\nExplicit references to the Speaker are generally edited out in the official transcript\nof parliamentary debates (Hansard), as they do not seem to contribute to the\ninformation content of the conversational contributions. This quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of explicit references to the Speaker has shown that they index\nthe macro presuppositions of the discourse of PMQs, targeting the participants\nrights and obligations as regards (1) turn allocation and turn-taking, (2)\nparticipant-exclusive rights and obligations to ask questions for the Leader of the\nOpposition and provide responses to the questions for the PM, (3) appropriateness\nof their conversational contributions as regards content and formulation,\nand (4) possible infringements on the interaction-ritual constraints. It has been\nshown that the discursive function of explicit references to the Speaker depends\non their positioning in the turn and on their local contexts. If they are positioned\ninitially and supplemented by expressions of gratitude, they fulfil a discourseorganisational\nfunction, acknowledging turn allocation. If they are realised medi-\nally and their embedding context is imbued with negativity, quotations, interruptions\nand other forms of disruption, they signal a conflictual situation.\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 81\n', '5. Discussion\nAccording to Harris (2001), ritual procedures of parliamentary discourse are\noften combined with FTAs and their communicative function of challenge. In\nthis context, she argues they serve to mitigate FTAs, thereby keeping the discourse\nwithin the bounds of acceptable parliamentary language. In the case of the\ninstances of discourse management as analysed and illustrated above, the notion\nof mitigating devices would not be relevant, because neither of these practices\nrequire any mitigation.\nNotably, however, explicit references to Mr Speaker were used significantly\nmore in the case of conflictual situations by the Leader of the Opposition than by\nthe PM. If such references are understood as a mitigating factor, then they might\nbe expected to occur more in conflictual situations, given that such situations are\nin themselves potentially face-threatening. Alternatively, such references may not\nmitigate the force of the FTA, but instead actually indicate that a stronger FTA is\nforthcoming. If the prime role of the Leader of the Opposition is to attack the government,\nit is also the case that the Leader of the Opposition has far less power\nthan the PM. Referring to Mr Speaker and thereby drawing his attention to the\nfact that their formulation of a challenge (with the content that the government\nhas failed in some way) might be seen as some kind of regulatory device – for\nexample, drawing attention to equivocation by the PM, or failing to meet the legitimate\nconcerns of the electorate, that is being accountable for their political deci-\nsions and politics to the electorate. Rather like a litigant appealing to the judge\nin a court case, the Leader of the Opposition may be seen as calling the PM to\naccount, complaining about the PM’s performance to a third party. What is more,\nthe Leader of the Opposition thereby indirectly draws the attention of other political\nstakeholders and the members of the public to the foregrounded criticisms.\nIn the Introduction, it was proposed that the question–response dynamic of\nPMQs and the role of the Speaker as the simultaneous recipient/moderator of\nquestions and responses might be conceptualised as ‘mediated address’, in particular\nagainst the background of PMQs not only being political discourse, but\nmediated political discourse produced and targeted towards the ratified media\naudience (Fetzer 2006). Furthermore, not only must the interactants communicate\nindirectly with one another through the Speaker, they must also refer to one\nanother only in the third person. This has some interesting implications. While at\none level, because the politicians do not confront one another directly this may\nreduce interpersonal conflict, at another level it may actually intensify it, because\nthe politicians are thereby freed from the necessity to use politeness strategies to\nsoften their face-threatening acts – they may use what is termed by Brown and\nLevinson (1987) as ‘bald on record’. Of course, this ‘exemption’ to use politeness\n82 Peter Bull, Anita Fetzer and Dániel Z. Kádár\n', 'strategies is not valid to all aspects of PMQs but only to cases of ritual aggression.\nFor instance, one may refer to questions relating to (inter)national tragedies\nwhere it would be unseemly for a questioner to abandon politeness strategies. Yet,\nas far as debates in PMQs are concerned, the contextual constraints and requirements\nand the conventions as regards the activity-specific use of language and\nactivity-specific address forms of the communicative activity of PMQs discourse\nallow for higher degree of directness in the linguistic realisation of these challenges.\nThis is because they do not need to consider the direct communication\npartner but rather refer to a neutralised distanced other: a ‘he’ or ‘she’, but not a\n‘you’.\n6. Conclusions\nElsewhere, the interaction between PM and the Leader of the Opposition has\nbeen likened to a form of ‘verbal pugilism’ (Bull and Wells, 2012). To pursue this\nmetaphor further, the role of the Speaker may be likened to that of a referee in\na boxing match, who is there to ensure fair play, that there are literally no ‘blows\nbelow the belt’, which in the context of PMQs might, for example, refer to instances\nof unparliamentary language, and excessive interruptions. Thereby, the obligation\non the politicians only to interact with one another indirectly through the use\nof third-person language may be seen as a mitigating device keeping the conflict\nwithin objects, but not subjects of talk, and thus within manageable limits.\nAt the same time, in talking about one another only in the third person, the\npoliticians may be freed from expectations to soften their criticisms through various\nforms of face-saving strategies. This is why PMQs represent a prime example\nof anti-structural ritual engagement, in which the order of interaction fundamentally\nchanges from what is customarily regarded as ‘ordinary’, ‘harmonious’, and\nso on and so forth. Indeed, referring explicitly to the Speaker – and the role as\na mediator and referee – may actually facilitate the formulation of almost unmitigated\nchallenges and thus attacks on a political opponent. These attacks are of\ncourse typically expected to occur, as per the ritual nature of PMQs. From this\nperspective, referring explicitly to the Speaker can be seen as a strategic feature of\noppositional politics, foregrounding criticism but still acting in accordance with\nthe contextual constraints of parliamentary language. In short, calling Mr Speaker\nMr Speaker can be seen very much as a means of conducting political opposition.\nCalling Mr Speaker ‘Mr Speaker’ 83\n', 'Funding\nThis work was supported by grant: Magyar Tudományos Akadémia (HU) (LP2017/5, awarded\nto Daniel Kadar and a grant from the German Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and\nDevelopment (GIF Grant I-153-104.3-2017) awarded to Anita Fetzer.\nReferences\nArcher, Dawn. 2008. “Verbal Aggression and Impoliteness: Related Or Synonymous?” In\nImpoliteness in Language: Studies on Its Interplay with Power in Theory and Practice, ed.\nby D.
