At this the as\nsailant fled. The matter was report\ned to the police.\nAbout an hour later, F*. L. Ja\ncobs, a farmer who lives northwest\nof Sherman, and who had his team\nin Tune\'s wagon yard on West Hous\nton street, went into the yard after\nattending one of the shows. He\nwalked over to the shed under\nwhich was his wagon, and then\nwalked down the long shed between\nsome wagons. As he reached the\nsouth end of the shed a man stepped\nout in front of him from the shad\nows,. and, throwing a pistol in his\nfare, demanded that he throw up his\nhands. He did so and was relieved of\n$6 by the robber.\nBesides the $5 in his pocket, Mr.\nJacobs had several dollars in silver\nin his pocket. When the robber ac\ncosted him he had Ills hand in his\npocket, and the hand was closed\nover the silver money.

She was rendered un\nconscious and soon died.\nBefore making the attempt at\nself-destruction Mrs. Cowper wrote\na number of letters, one to her law\nyer, another to the coroner, a third\nto an undertaker and a fourth to\nJohn Hood, a fffind. In the letters\nshe apprised these four persons of\nher intention to commit suicide.\n! At about the moment Mrs. Cow\nper pressed her finger to the trig\n\' ger of the revolver, the letter a.1\n! dressed to John Hood was being de\nlivered. Mr. Hood glanced through\nthe first few lines, grabbed his coat\nand hat and ran to the St. Regis ho\ntel. He was breathless when he told\nthe clerk of the letter he had receiv\ned .\nThe clerk secured a pass key and\nhurried lo the room of Mrs. Cowper,\naccompanied by Mr Hood and a\nmaid employed in the hotel.

Decem\nber 1. Very few people know that all\nor nearly all of the Mother (loose\nI rhymes, including the celebrated and\n! familiar legend of "The Cat and the\n\' Fiddle," were not originally written\nj to amuse the little ones and woo\nι the sand man. They were first pub\nlished as entries and lampoons on\nroyalty, nobility and foremost men\nland women of England. "High Diddle\nj Diddle, the Cat and the Fiddle" was\na thrust at the gaiety of Queen Eliza\nbeth\'s court. It was one round of\ndancing and feasting and merry\nI making, generally at the expense of\nj the courtiers, who, were satallltes of\nI the "Virgin Queen," and a number\nI of these noble gallants ruined\nι themselves In trying to please their\nι sovereign. Even in those days many\n! of the people looked askance at all\nj this needless and foolish extrava\nI gance and revel, and some looked\nupon dancing as the invention of the\ndevil—the cat being then considered\nthe especial feature of witchcraft,\nand evil, and hence as belonging to\nthe devil. "The cow jumped over the\nthe moon" was intended as a direct\nthrust at Queen Elizabeth herself\nand her vaulting ambition and van\nity. Those quaint bits of history in\nconnection with our old childhood\nrhymes are interesting reading and\nit will be a surprise to many of our\nreaders that before cartoons were\never dreamed of these rhymes filled\ntheir places. But there is no politi\ncal significance in the coming pro\nduction of "The Cat and the Fid\ndle." It is full of significance of\nother kinds: the dressing of the\nmagic and charming music. It is a\njingle of our childhood with the roy\nal and wonderful wealth of stage\none of continuous series of pleasing\nsurprises, that almost re-establishes\nour faith in the actual existence of\nfairies, gnomes.

Nov. 28.- Re\ngarded by engineers as a marvel of\nconstruction is the Spokane, Port\nland and Seattle railway, 42Γ» miles,\nι he most direct line between this\ncity and Portland, which will be\ncompleted January 1. 1909. The\nroad, built jointly by the Great Nor\nthern and Northern Pacific systems,\nis the most expensive in America,\nthe cost of much of it ranging from\nf i».00o to $.">00,000 a mile. Twen\nty-five miles of track remains to be\nlaid between Spokane and Pasco, and\nfliis work will be completed in two\n\\\\»>eks Besides this there are two\nbridges a mile pa rat near Devil\'s\nan von One is 1,100 feet in length\nund -20 feet high, while the other\nis 1,000 feet long and 160 feet\nibove the ground in the center.\nThe line will permit of longer\n! T ains being hauled over it than on\nni\\ other road in the country. The\nmost severe grade is 4-in of one per\n• nt. and between Cheney, Spokane\nrount> and Portland, the line is down\n^rade. There are no sharp curvatures\nthe greatest being three degrees,\nand. as a result, one locomotive can\npull from Spokane to Portland as\nmany cars as it can start 011 level\nground. This is expected to set new\nreeords for heavy loading\nThe road has been built without\nregard to expense, the purpose being\nto make it permanent and safe.

When\nthis tube is inflamed you have a\nrumbling sound or imperfect hear\ning, and when it is entirely closed, |\ndeafness is the result, and unless the\ninflammation can be taken out and ;\ntills tube restored to its normal con\ndition. hearing will be destroyed\nforever: nine cases out of ten are\ncaused by Catarrh, which is nothing\nbut an inflamed condition of the\nmucous surfaces.\nWe will give One Hundred Dol\nlars for any case of deafness (caused\nby catarrh) that cannot be cured by\nHall\'s Catarrh Cure.

It is caused by an in\nvisible growth of vegetable character that finds lodgment in the se\nbaceous glands of the scalp. This growth disturbs the functions of the\nsebaceous glands, causing excessive oiliness or extreme dryness of the\nliair. It also sets up an inflammatory process that extends down the\nfollicle to the papilla, where the adhesions are loosened and the hair\nslips out. The value of Newbro\'s Herpicide in such cases is quite extra\nordinary. Its intelligent use will correct every condition short of chron\nic baldness and thus permit *he hair to resume its natural luster and\nabundance.\nMISS EDNA IKVINE\nA noted Theatrical Star\nwhose photograph is here reproduced\nWRITES AS FOLLOWS: "I can most heartily endorse New\nbro\'s Herpicide.
