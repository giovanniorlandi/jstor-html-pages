The numerous studies into this topic show a tendency \ntowards studying and analysing specific cases such as organizational management2/3, \nbusiness change and development, technology4, education5, sociology, psychology, \nmedia, communication6, etc. from the perspective of the limited concept of replacing \nsomething with something else of the same type. We have not, however, come across \nany studies or articles addressing the change of the system in different countries, which \nrequires development afterwards. We do understand such diversion, but despite the \nextreme “scorched earth” challenge, we will try to make a more complex analysis of \nthis issue, putting Albania in the centre of the debate.\n1 Jacobs, J., Change vs, Development: Is there a difference?, Focus Magazine, Victoria, Canada, April 15, 2010.\n2 Fannin, K., Organizational Change and Transformation, 6 Critical Differences and Why they Matter, INTELIVATE, February 13, \n2018.\n3 Organizational Change: Development and Transformation, Gret Books Online, 2016.\n4 The Change and Development of the Qantas Airlines, Gret Books Online, 2016.\n5 Curriculum Development and Change Essay, Gret Books Online, 2016.\n6 Arnold, AK., Media Development vs. Communication for Development: Structure vs. Process, The World Bank, May 8, 2010.\n', '54     AcAdemicus - internAtionAl scientific JournAl www.AcAdemicus.edu.Al     54\nEvery country resists7 change. This is related with its past and depends on how fast its \nmentality can change. This is because mentality changes more slowly and may serve \nas a reference. The change of a system, though, is much more complex and difficult. \nAnd this is not only internally due to mentality. In the case of small countries, the \nbiggest external difficulty is related with the international partners leading change and \ndevelopment, who do not have sufficient experience with how systems change. In the \nabsence of such experience, they try to “invent” a path we can take, although this is \nsometimes not the shortest one.\nIn Albania, political change came as in every other Eastern country, without anyone \nbeing asked whether it could come. It just happened, and the country was involved \nin a swift political and economic transition with lots of courage. Albanians were \nfrustrated with the previous system and perceived the democratic system as more \nappropriate. Such a huge change required the country to develop. It was development \nwhat gave people courage to silently accept the tiring reforms ahead. Change without \ndevelopment was nothing for everyone, because everyone thought the democratic \nsystem would provide unlimited employment opportunities to all, and that poverty \nwould be alleviated to the point of being forgotten. This, however, would take several \nreforms, which would certainly cost. It was precisely the big wish for change, which \ngave people the courage to cope with every consequence of such reforms. Various \ninternational partners, however, had their own objectives regarding Albania, which \ndid not necessarily correspond with these ideas, and were not always the same for \neach partner. Under such circumstances, we think that the most comfortable position \nfor them was to support change at any cost and in no time. Albania had no clear \nidea whatsoever. That was because no one knew whether it should have been change \nwhich came first and followed by development, or both at the same time, especially \nwith the international partners being actually the ones, who would finance both minds \nand reforms to be undertaken. \nChange and development are separate concepts8 and are only confused by those who \ndeliberately want to do so.\nMethodology\nWe have analysed in details both the local and foreign literature on political and \neconomic transition in former Communist countries, as well as the evolution of the \nlegal framework in these countries. The political and electoral programs of each party \nhave also been studies, as well as their results and those of their coalitions in elections. \nThe evaluation of the concept of Development and Change in Albania is based on a \n7 Ford, Jeffrey D, Ford, Laury W., Resistance to Change a Reexamination and Extension, Research in Organizational Change and \nDevelopment, Vol 17, UK, 2009.\n8 Jacobs, J., Change vs, Development: Is there a difference? Focus Magazine, Victoria, Canada, April 15, 2010.\n', 'i. JehA, Y. ÇAbiri - western bAlkAns, AlbAniA And the diAtribe between development And chAnge     55\ncomprehensive analysis of the numerous examples shared during interviews with key \ncharacters of the Albanian transition, and the opinions expressed by many people, \nwho were willing to respond to a special online survey.\nThe survey was intended to help us understand clearly what the perception of the \npublic is when it comes to the ration between change and development, and especially \ntheir opinion about the role of international partners during transition in the context \nof that ration. The survey enabled us to identify the perception of a much larger \nnumber of people than ‘traditional’ surveys. The average number of answers to each \nquestion was more than 3800 answers; in addition to the 20 interviews with the key \nfigures of Albanian transition, there were also six focus group discussions to gather \nspecialised opinions about the actual ratio between development and change, the \nrole of the local political parties about such ratio, and the influence of the opinion of \nthe international partners on that ratio. Testing our opinions and deductions on the \nmatter was yet another goal of such discussions.\nStability or Democracy?\nThe concept of Change and Development have been first involved in the debate about \nstability and democracy. This concept was for the first time discussed by UNDP in \nTirana, in the context of the Human Development Report9, but the discussion was not \nvery direct. It was found, however, that the international partners tended to focus \nmore on stability than democracy.\nIt was, therefore quite clear that the international community was insisted more \non stability in the case of the Western Balkans countries. In the case of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, stability was guaranteed by Dayton Agreement, which was agreement \non ending the war, and not simply on establishing democracy. And war did actually \nend, but Bosnia and Herzegovina is actually the last country in the region. Now, \nfollowing unsuccessful steps for years, the country is more and more clearly realizing \nthat what it needs is a new agreement, one on a new democratic order, because \nwar is no longer an option for solution. So, stability is guaranteed, but democracy \nis not making a lot of progress, which indicates clearly the position of this country \nin the process of European Union integration. While in a more advanced position in \nthis process, Albania tempts its international partners to expect more stability for the \ncountry out of the fear of the recurrence of the evil 1997. A clear external effort for \ninstability has also contributed to this tendency towards instability. So, the stand of \nthe international partners regarding Albania is not conditioned by their fear of genetic \ninstability, but also due to influence of geopolitics. What about democracy then? It is \nalways wrongly assumed that the country stability is the priority, while democracy can \nbe built step-by-step. This stand is now further ‘refined’ and no more is longer said \n9 UNDP, The Human Development Report – Albania 2002, Tirana, 2002.\n', '56     AcAdemicus - internAtionAl scientific JournAl www.AcAdemicus.edu.Al     56\nabout the ratio between stability and democracy. It is only the ratio between change \nand development that is addressed.\nDevelopment or Change?\nAlmost all the respondents think that the political and economic transition in Albania, \nwhich started in 1991, is prolonged and only a significant number of them (about 4% \nout of 3622 answers in total) consider the transition period as normal for a country \nlike Albania. These were even fewer than those who said ‘don’t know’ (see Figure 1). \nIt remains unclear, however, for all when the political and economic transition can be \nconsidered over.\nFigure 1: Transition in Albania is considered lengthy\nIn addition to the slow reform of the mentality of the previous system and various \nsectors of economy, such prolongation seems to have been significantly influenced \nalso by the attitude of our main international partners10 to change and development in \nAlbania. Most of them have made a clear choice: Albanians must change the system, \nputting an end to Communism once for all. Development is not possible unless such \nchange occurs. This is a firm and consistent opinion, without saying or explaining, \nhowever, when change is over and development starts. \nThe World Bank itself, having first spent millions of dollars on assisting Albania with \nthe intention of first restructuring and then privatizing the state-owned enterprises, \nchanged its opinion when they realized that it would have been much easier and much \nmore efficient for the state budget to first privatise them and let their new owners \nrestructure them at their own costs. Colossal damage was already done though. There \ncould be no such firm decision, here the path of change did not seem to be known \nthat well.\n10 The main international partners for Albania have always been the United States of America and the European Union.\n', 'i. JehA, Y. ÇAbiri - western bAlkAns, AlbAniA And the diAtribe between development And chAnge     57\nNevertheless, it was strongly insisted in creating a mentality of eradicating communism. \nThe change of the political system in Albania and the establishment of democracy and \nmarket economy were ‘entrusted’ to the international partners, as larger and more \nexperienced with fighting communism and establishment of the market economy. \nSince the beginning, the motto of everyone in Albania was “Let’s make Albania like \nall Europe!” The United States of America, on the other hand, have always been a \nlighthouse to Albanians, which was also clearly expressed on the visit of Mr. Baker11 \n(James A. Baker) in Tirana in the summer of 1991, when change had already started. \nMany of the industrial works that could have survived in technological terms, were \ndestroyed and ended up increasingly worse under the motto that they were built by \nthe Communists, and had therefore to be demolished and new and better ones had \nto be built! The Metallurgic Factory in Elbasan, Textile Factory in Berat, Factory of \nInstruments in Korça, Cable Factory in Shkodra, Cooper Mine, Enrichment Factory, \nFactory of Azotic Fertilisers, etc., are some of the examples, which did have all the \ntechnical possibility to even partially survive technological competition, without \naffecting people’s employment. It was late when people realised that no one intended \nto finance such amounts of money, and that these works turned out to be irreplaceable. \nThe stand towards factories already built in the previous system, clearly expressed \nalso by many international partners, affected us all, because that wealth belonged to \nus and not only to those who lost their jobs, leaving their country and family behind. \nThe cost of such wrong mentality was unimaginable and losses unrecoverable for the \ncountry and for each one of us! Home policy was also very conservative, hindering \nconcessions and privatisations as much as possible. It would have been completely \ndifferent for these facilities and the respective communities if the decision makers \nwere open-minded to globalization and if they would have ‘given’ such facilities \nto those, who knew better than us how to use them, and who actually came here \nto ‘take’ them. We did not do that, and we destroyed them. Was it ignorance? \nNarrow-mindedness? It could be, but our research shows that there is more to it. \nNone of the international partners, who had in their hands the steering wheel of a small \ncountry like Albania, did not ‘think’ of the country’s development, while ‘batteries’ \nfocused on the fight against Communism, i.e. change, as if Communism had been for \nthe first time invented in Albania. This also explains why transition in Albania is not yet \nover (see Figure 2), where the “finger of blame” points to the national governments \n(about 45% of 3737 answers) as to the international partners as well (32%).\n11 Mr James A Baker was at the time the Secretary of Foreign Affairs in the Government of President Clinton.\n', '58     AcAdemicus - internAtionAl scientific JournAl www.AcAdemicus.edu.Al     58\nFigure 2: Transition prolonged by international partners?\nSince our international partners, (those who until yesterday were considered Albanians’ \nbiggest hope), were considered one of the main cases of our lengthy transition, we \ndecided to go deeper into our study. This is because we find it impossible to explain \nhow the international partners have not yet deemed it reasonable to draft a reform \nstrategy even after 27 years of political change. Us? Well, we would not do that on our \nown anyway. There are also often incomplete explanations made by them in assessing \nthe progress made reforms in the country, like “Albania has made one important \nmore step ahead” or “Albanians are entering a new stage”, etc. without indicating \nwhere Albania is actually headed, or how many more steps are to be taken, when this \ntransition is expected to be over, while everyone is losing their patience, thinking how \nmuch more we need to develop to be like everybody else.\nUltimately, it is clear that this prolongation is much more related with how others \nselectively choose between our Change and Development. In the meantime, most of \nthe Albanian people think that the actual ratio between Change and Development is \nin favour of change (59% of 3826 answers), with only a few of the respondents (18%) \nthinking that change and development in Albania have been balanced, while many \nmore (about 11%) consider this ratio normal (see Figure 3). This means that focussing \nso much on change and assessing only indicators of democracy has not favoured \ndevelopment at all (if not hindering it, this has at least not encouraged it).\n', 'i. JehA, Y. ÇAbiri - western bAlkAns, AlbAniA And the diAtribe between development And chAnge     59\nFig 3: Balance between change and development\nThe ignorance of the local experts and the blind trust on the international experts could \nhave been the real reasons of this mentality, for which Albanians are paying a high \nprice. However, what is more important than this analysis is the overall opinion about \nthe theoretical ratio between change and development (see Figure 4). The majority of \nthe answers (51% of the 3,126 answers in total) are in favour of a parallel progress on \nChange and Development. This means that the majority today thinks that in addition \nto fighting communism and building a democratic system, it is very important for the \ncountry to develop in parallel. Being at the same time against the scepticism of the \nsupporters of the Communist system, this would prove better, the great advantages of \nthe democratic system compared with the previous system. Why was then the actual \nratio not challenged?\nFigure 4: Theoretical ratio between change and development\n', '60     AcAdemicus - internAtionAl scientific JournAl www.AcAdemicus.edu.Al     60\nDevelopment would enable economic stability, alleviate poverty, attract foreign \ninvestments, and increase employment. There is no reason for all of this to be left for \n“later”, giving priority to change, as was actually the case.\nIt must be clear for everyone that beyond the political and media debate, the system \nin a small country like Albania would ultimately happen anyway, because Communism \nwas not a system that emerged and developed in this country only. The overwhelming \nmajority of the population did not want Communism, and tried to immediately take \nadvantage of democracy. Political parties in the country, on the other hand, keep \nsaying for their own purposes, that Communism is not yet dead in Albania. \nFigure 5: Country’s development indicators are worsened \nFigure 5 reflects the opinion about why Albanians are not satisfied with the actual \nratio between Change and Development. It can be seen that more than 65% of the \nanswers out of 3,887 answers in total think that according to international reports, \nthe indicators of the country’s development, have worsened. Actually, 69% of the \npeople think that poverty and unemployment have increased, especially in villages. \nAlso, many people think that Communism in Albania is dead (51%) and that almost no \none is nostalgic about the previous system (64%). Therefore, politicians and decision \nmakers should no longer blame the Communist system, but take all the responsibilities \nfor the consequences of everything they do or not do.\nConclusions and recommendations\nModern literature addresses slightly the concept of Change and Development at \nthe level of countries and the ratio between them. This concept is rather treated in \nspecific areas, because it is in our opinion easier to address the ratio between change \nand development in terms of specific areas than at the level of countries. In the case \nof Albania, this is about changing the system. When Communism was ousted, a new \nera started for Albanians, the era of a democratic system. Being that the building of \nthe democratic system based on the destruction of the previous one goes through \n', 'i. JehA, Y. ÇAbiri - western bAlkAns, AlbAniA And the diAtribe between development And chAnge     61\na new and not properly known by all the stakeholders, including the international \npartners, it is understandable how difficult it is to be aware of the shortcuts. This is \nso true that turning back was several times necessary due to recommended paths \nwere too long and expensive. This does not include the fact that international partners \nhave often had their own strategies for each country in the region, which did not \nnecessarily correspond with the country’s priorities. It is strongly recommended that \nthe transition of former Communist countries be further studies, especially in terms \nof the ratio between change and development.\nDebate on the ratio between Change and Development is preceded by a similar debate \non stability and democracy. International partners have often been more interested in \nthe stability of the countries of the Western Balkan than for the development of their \ndemocracy. This has led to many negative consequences for each of these countries. \nA new agreement focused on development is recommended for Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.\nIn fact, transition in the case of Albania, as in every country in the region, is \nprocrastinated. There is not yet any written criteria about the closure of political and \neconomic transition in the country. What is only known is that Albanians have a plan \nA, and the Sllavics a plan B. Yet, the accession of the countries of the region in the \nEuropean Union is facing an unmeasurable skepticism of the EU member states due to \ntheir perception of the region as not properly developed economically and politically. \nClear criteria are recommended to be written for the closure of the political and \neconomic transition, so that transition is not indefinite and any subjective assessment \nis avoided.\nA serious problem is that, the finger is pointed also (and for the first time) at the \nInternational Partners for this lack of Development. The skepticism of the EU countries \nabout EU membership of the countries in this region is in this case the skepticism of the \nguilty ones, those who did not encourage development, who did not show sufficient \ninterest in the development of the Western Balkan ghetto because of priorities related \nsimply with their mentality about change.\nNaturally, retrospective enables us to make more objective assessments of the ratio \nbetween Change and Development, but time seems to be the most irrelevant variable \nin this kind of assessment. What matters is that the majority thinks that Change \nand Development must progress in parallel. Dissatisfaction with lack of attention \nfor development, and actually neglecting it, emerges mostly from anti-Communist \nmentality, the ousting of the system, while the majority thinks that this system no \nlonger exists. Intensive efforts are recommended to be made for better indicators of \nthe economic development as the only path towards alleviating poverty and increasing \nemployment, especially in villages.\n', '62     AcAdemicus - internAtionAl scientific JournAl www.AcAdemicus.edu.Al     62\nBibliography\n1.
