We suppose that the\nmanagement deigned to notify the lo\ncal papers regarding the fair dates,\nat least. But we\'ll venture the sug\ngestion that the weekly papers of\nClark county have about twenty times\nthe circulation that any daily that\nenters its territory has..\n-ISP\nThe Clark fair management will\nfind similar conditions in the sur\nrounding counties. For every copy\nof any daily that enters the counties\nof the northeastern part of the state,\nit is our opinion that from ten to\ntwenty copies of the weekly newspa\npers may be found. 4\nBesides, when a weekly newspaper\ngoes into a home it is read column\nby column whereas only the leading\narticles in the daily are perused, and,\nas a rule, those whose headings riv\net attention.\nWe suggest that before another fail\nrolls around oui Clark friends, who\nhave the interests of the fair at\nheart and who feel that iti si worth\nwhile to let surrounding communities\nknow about the fair, pay. a litjtle at\ntention to the weekly newspapers—\nto the extent, at any rate, of letting\nthem know the dates and inviting\nthem over to see the pigs and the\npumpkins.\nHAS A HiiSH OPINION Of7\nM-\nBERLAIN\'S TABLETS.\n"I have a high, opinion of Chamber\nlain\'s Tablets for biliousness and as\na laxative," writes Mrs. C.

"I have never found\nanything «o maid and pleasant to use.\nMy brother has also used these tab\nlets with satisfactory results." 14-16\nThe person who traveled the farthest\nto attend the recent old settlers reun\nion and the celebration of the open\ning of the reservation at Summit was\nO.

If con\nditions generally in the surrounding\ncounties were as they seem to have\nbeen in Codangton county the fair\nwas not at all well advertised.

The emperor has evi\ndently changed his tune if not his\nmind since the opening of the war.\nAlready the cost of the war, to\nsay nothing of the destruction of\nproperty, approximates one hun\ndred billion dollars, the interest on\nwhich, at five per centum, aggre\ngates five billion dollars a year.\nIt is obvious that the federal\nofficials of the United States hayen\'t\ntold/ all that they know about\' the\nsituation concerning the propa\nganda in behalf of the German gov\nernment.\nWe recall the igreat outcry that\nwent up when the congressional\nappropriations passed the billion\ndollar mark. Now, however, the\nman who speaks in sums under a\nbillion is but a small potato and\nfew in a hill.\nIf price regulation operates so as\nto afford something like equal op\nportunity for all, there will be a\ngrowing demand that the govern\nment continue as a price regulator\nafter the war shall have been\nbrought to a close.\nThe remark which called forth\nthe most vociferous applause at\nthe recent Nonpartisan League\nmeeting at St. Paul, according to\nthe press reports, is the observa\ntion that there are but two classes\nof people in America: "the skinned\nand the skinners."\nThe upward tendency of the price\nof steel hag reached the climax and\nhas half a notion to run in the\nother direction. Why? Because\nthere is a suspicion that the United\nStates government will step in be\nfore January 1 next with a regula\ntion of the prices at which steel\nmay be sold.\nYes,,we rather think that if the\nprices of grain for the past ten\nyears had\' been at the high average\nwhich has characterized prices for\nthe past two months, the farmers\nwould have constituted the money\naristocracy of the realm.

No press in Watertown, nor,\nindeed, in the entire northern half of\nthe state, has capacity to print the\nentire edition in one operation hence\nit is necessary to print the paper in\nsections. Inasmuch^ as it will require\nabout sixty hours of continuous oper\nation for The Saturday News news\npaper prees-to complete the edition, it\nwill be observed that the process of\nprinting will have to begin very early\nin the week. Correspondence that\ndoes not reach the office as early as\nMoiiday or Tuesday morning may have\nto go over. Owing to the extraordin\narily large number of copies that will\nbe printed, and the number of extra\npages the edition will contain, no cor\nrespondent should be unrepresented\nin this special number. The paper\nMil go into every home in Codington\ncounty and into most of the homes\nof the surrounding counties. The\npurpose is three-fold: to advertise the\nFall Festival to be held in Watertowp\nIn4 October, to advertise the Saturday\nNews and to advertise thosa. who ad\nvertise in The Saturday News. Inci\ndentally, it may be suggested that\nthere is still aonther object, namely,\nto ^wivfertise the splendid corps of\ncorrespondents who supply the news\nof the neighboring communities in\nThe Saturday News/\' -If any other\nnewspaper in the state has a better\nand more liveiy corps of correspond\nents than has this paper we\'d like to\nj»ee, the color of its hair.
