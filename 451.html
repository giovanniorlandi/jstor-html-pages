Grossman\nHunter College Library, City University of New York, USA\n‘A Century of Progress’ international exposition was a celebration of science, \nand its role in improving daily life, staged in 1933, the low point of the Great \nDepression. The leading exhibits represented large corporations or governments,\nbut there were some library-related exhibits at the fair. This paper \nexamines the exhibits staged or planned by the American Library Association,\nthe Library of Congress, and Time, Incorporated. Unlike Time, Inc., \nthe American Library Association and the Library of Congress were both \nhampered by a lack of funds. The two library organizations also failed to \nfind a way to incorporate the theme of scientific progress in their exhibits, \nwhereas Time, Inc. succeeded in using a library as an advertisement for its \nso-called invention, the weekly news magazine.\nkeywords world’s fairs, American Library Association, Carl Milam, Rufus C. \nDawes, Time, Inc., Henry Luce\nIntroduction\n‘A Century of Progress’ international exposition was held on Chicago’s lakefront in \n1933 and 1934. It was a new kind of American world’s fair, in its appearance and in \nits underlying message. This paper will explore whether and to what extent libraries \nfound a place at the fair, by examining the participation of two especially prominent \nlibrary organizations, the American Library Association (ALA) and the Library of \nCongress. Set against these two organizations is the exhibit of a commercial publisher\nwho displayed a quasi-library of magazines, Time, Inc. The unsatisfying results \nachieved at the fair by the ALA and the Library of Congress contrast with the success \nachieved by Time, Inc., which was able to devote substantial funds to its exhibit. The \nALA and Library of Congress, on the other hand, were hampered by a severe lack of \n', '104 HAL B. GROSSMAN\nfunds. In addition, Time, Inc. showed itself better able to grasp the kind of showmanship\nthat the Fair’s organizers hoped for, resulting in an exhibit that outshone those \nof the two library organizations.1\n‘A Century of Progress’ was first conceived as a celebration of the one-hundredth \nanniversary of the founding of Chicago as a municipality in 1833. But the 1933 fair’s \norganizers soon came to believe that Chicago’s growth from ‘a small settlement of 28 \nsouls to the third largest city in the world’ was a result of the same forces, science \nand invention, that had transformed life everywhere.2 So a local celebration became \nan international one, with progress as its central theme, progress in science that had \ntransformed industry, society, and daily life. Early in the planning process, the fair’s \norganizers came to conceive of it as a new type of world’s fair. Older fairs, most \nnotably the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, featured displays of \nmany products in competition, with blue ribbons or gold medals for the best in each \ncategory. The 1893 fair also had a library of books by women and exhibits from \npublishers.3 The leaders of the effort to stage a 1933 world’s fair decided to eschew \ncompetition and aim instead for cooperative exhibits that would show the progress \nmade by each industry or area of life. They also departed from the 1893 model in two \nother crucial ways. The 1893 fair was known as the White City, for its uniformly \nwhite beaux-arts buildings. The 1933 fair would be a festival of colour, featuring \ndramatically curving and soaring art deco structures. The 1893 fair was symmetrical \nin layout and stately in appearance; the 1933 fair would be asymmetrical and swirling, \npulsating with energy. The 1933 fair would also try to educate as well as entertain. \nIts president, Rufus C. Dawes, and its general manager, Lenox R. Lohr, would \nenlist the National Research Council to provide solid scientific and social-science \ninformation on ways in which society had progressed that could be represented at \nthe fair. Showmanship and education would mix at Chicago in 1933.4 As Lenox Lohr \nput it, ‘Each separate exhibit must present some novel feature that will attract and \ninterest’.5\nThe fair had corporate pavilions, buildings erected by foreign countries and by the \nUS federal government, and thematic pavilions, most notably the Hall of Science, the \nTransportation Building, and the Hall of Social Science, which were built by the fair \norganization itself. Of these thematic buildings, fair officials considered the Hall of \nScience to be the most important. Here were exhibits on progress in mathematics, \nphysics, chemistry, medicine, and other fields. For the fair’s organizers, scientific \nprogress was something that the public needed to learn about, because it was applied \nby industry to better the daily lives of everyone, in ways not fully appreciated. The \nDepression made this message more urgent than before. At the dedication ceremony \nfor the Hall of Science the keynote speaker, Frank B. Jewett of Bell Laboratories, \nasserted that educating the public about the march of scientific progress would help \nstem political radicalism and social unrest.6 The fair’s organizers conceived of progress \nas an impersonal force producing new products, medical treatments, and modes of \ntransport and communication. Humanity’s role was to be the consumer and beneficiary\nof these advances. Older notions of progress that included social justice and \nenhanced individual freedom were downplayed in favour of a consumerist vision of \nsociety.7\nA central, and intended, effect of the fair was to place its moment of 1933 in a \nbroad context of material and social progress. Some exhibits, such as the recreation \n', '105UNDERFUNDED AND OUTSHONE\nof old Fort Dearborn, reminded visitors of the phenomenal growth of Chicago (and \nby extension the nation) since 1833. Many other exhibits held out the promise of a \nbetter life in the future. The driving force here was scientific progress, presented as a \nforce outside of, and largely immune to, the social problems of the day. It was fitting \nthat a sculpture at the entrance to the Hall of Science was called ‘Science Advancing \nMankind’ and consisted of a giant, benevolent robot leaning down in a nurturing \nposture behind a man and woman.8 Fair planners sought exhibits that would embody \n‘a philosophy of showmanship for the contributions of science and their application’.9 \nThis showmanship meant exhibiting processes whenever possible, rather than just \nthe finished products that earlier fairs had displayed. Thus, visitors to the General \nMotors pavilion saw a real Chevrolet assembly line, which produced real cars. Visitors\nto other exhibits could see bacon being sliced and packaged, movie scenes filmed, \ntelevision demonstrated, and a pageant illustrating a century of progress in transportation.\nThis paper will explore whether and how libraries were able to participate in \nthis display of scientific progress and the better future that it promised. How these \norganizations presented themselves, whether they were able to claim a place in the \nstory of progress that the fair sought to tell, which exhibits succeeded and how, tell \nus much about the state of libraries in the crisis year of 1933.\n‘A Century of Progress’ was conceived during the prosperous late 1920s, but organized\nand opened to the public during the Great Depression. The economic calamity \nthat began in 1929 was a strong headwind for the fair to overcome, and it affected \nwhat exhibits were on view in 1933. The basic outlines of the Depression in the \nUnited States are familiar: a 25 per cent unemployment rate in 1933, breadlines, an \n89 per cent decline in stock prices from the 1929 peak to the 1932 low, deflation, and \nwage cuts. But two items more vividly illustrate the hard times that faced the Fair’s \norganizers. One was Lenox Lohr’s statement that two-thirds of all construction in \nChicago in 1932 was done at the fair;10 this meant that the pace of building in the \n‘real’ city of Chicago was very slow indeed. The other was a letter written in January \n1933 by a woman in Fairhope, Alabama, to a fair official. The writer said, ‘We are \namazed at the interest shown in the Fair when people have so little money — and \nmuch trading here is done by means of BARTER as cash is scarce. Yet many people \n[plan] to visit Chicago this coming summer and take the whole family to see the Fair. \nIf times were half way normal the attendance would be very large [. . .]’.11 Hard times \ncaused many potential exhibitors to stay away, but hard times also fostered a desire \nto be reminded of how society had progressed and would progress in the future. As \none Chicagoan recalled forty years later, ‘It seemed as if one could flee the Depression \nsimply by plunking down 50 cents and walking through the gate’.12 Nor was this \nimpression a product of memory. One reporter who visited the fair at its opening in \nMay 1933 wrote that the fair was ‘Chicago’s defiant embodiment of its belief that \nmankind does go forward and that the best is yet to come’.13 Another reporter, visiting\nthe fair later in 1933 and listening to fairgoers’ conversations, detected ‘that note \nof something which was not quite anxiety, and certainly not serenity’. Fairgoers \nwanted to imbibe confidence in the country: ‘It is as though all these people had come \nto the fair to reassure themselves, to prove to their own satisfaction that America was \nsolid and that nothing had really happened to stop the wheels of progress permanently’.14\nIn the fair’s 1933 season, which ran from late May through early November, \n', '106 HAL B. GROSSMAN\nnearly 23 million people attended, spending a total of $35 million, which was successful\nenough that the fair opened for a second season in 1934, something no American \nworld’s fair had done before.15\nThe American Library Association\nOne of the guiding principles behind ‘A Century of Progress’ was to emphasize \ncooperation rather than competition among the fair’s exhibitors. Even though most \nlarge corporations that participated at the fair rejected cooperation in favour of touting\ntheir own products, some industries with small producers did cooperate, most \nnotably the dairy industry.16 The fair organizers never gave up on the idea of cooperation,\nand trade associations seemed an ideal vehicle for cooperative exhibits. Fair \nofficials had approached such groups as the American Bankers Association, groups \nof mutual and fire insurance companies, an association of progressive schools, the \nNational Retail Credit Association, and the American Federation of Labor. Another \ngroup that seemed, to fair organizers, to belong at the fair was the ALA.17 The ALA \nwas headquartered in Chicago, making arrangements easy; it represented the highly \nfragmented field of public libraries; and it could tell a story of progress achieved over \nthe prior one hundred years. The ALA, too, wanted to be at the fair, to display its \nsocial contributions at a time of pressure on library budgets. But the same dreadful \neconomy that threatened library funding also acted to reduce the ALA’s presence at \nthe fair to almost nothing.\nThe ALA had mounted an exhibit at the previous world’s fair in Chicago, the \nWorld’s Columbian Exposition of 1893. Under the leadership of Melvil Dewey, the \nALA displayed a model public library intended to teach public librarians how to \naccomplish Dewey’s goals of professionalism, efficiency, and book selection designed \nto uplift and educate the public. A separate women’s library, overseen by the Board \nof Lady Governors of the 1893 fair, took a different approach. This library, designed \nto be a beautiful and welcoming space, displayed books written by women in the \nAmericas from 1492 onwards. Although it reflected the cultural attitudes of its time, \nthe women’s library seems to have been more inclusive and also more aesthetically \npleasing than the ALA exhibit, and fairgoers of 1893 responded more favourably to \nit.18 As we will see, the ALA’s approach to exhibiting suffered from a comparable \nnarrowness in 1933, and a lack of money only compounded the problem.\nFair officials contacted the ALA about participating in the fair as early as 1928, \noffering to send a speaker to an ALA meeting in Chicago in December. If the ALA \nwas on a tight schedule at its meeting, the speaker for the fair could deliver a ‘short, \nsnappy’ talk of ten minutes in length.19 There is no evidence that this talk happened, \nbut cordial contact continued on other matters. Carl Milam, Secretary of the ALA, \ntold fair officials that ALA delegates to the next meeting of the International Library \nand Bibliographic Committee would ask that the Committee meet in Chicago in 1933, \nwhich would generate foreign interest in the fair.20 More importantly, the ALA \nExecutive Board voted on New Year’s Day 1930 to hold its 1933 annual conference \nin Chicago, in conjunction with the fair.21\nAnother way in which Carl Milam sought to make the ALA useful in planning the \nfair was his proposal to set up a special library for fair organizers. Milam’s proposal \n', '107UNDERFUNDED AND OUTSHONE\nplaced greatest stress on the special librarian who would serve the fair, noting that \n‘A good librarian is not a passive worker. He will discover material needed and get \nit; and he will find ways of disseminating useful information and of otherwise promoting\nthe interests of the organization’. The library need not be large, Milam wrote; \na good selection of reference books, relevant periodicals, and a clipping file would \ndo. ‘This is a service department’, he explained, ‘not a collection of books’.22 Milam’s \nproposal was well in tune with the lean and efficient way in which the fair was \norganized.\nThe special library was only one of four ways in which Milam hoped that the ALA \nwould participate in the fair. The second was ‘a working branch library’ to serve \nemployees at the fair. This could also be a model for visitors of ‘what branch public \nlibrary service is’. Milam’s third idea was ‘library features in their proper setting’. \nFor example, if the fair contained a model school exhibit, or a model hospital, these \nexhibits should include a model school or hospital library. Finally came the idea \nof library exhibits themselves. These would ‘illustrate how a college library serves \ncollege students and faculty; how a public library serves adult students, foreign-born \nreaders of foreign languages, children, blind readers, et cetera’.23 Fair organizers, \nespecially in the Social Science Division and the Science Division of the Department \nof Exhibits, were quite sympathetic to Milam’s way of thinking. For example, \nMilam’s ideas were well received by Howard W. Odum, chief of the fair’s Social \nScience Division and a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill;24 Odum was already the author of a booklet on sociology for the general \nreader, issued as part of the ALA’s ‘Reading with a Purpose’ series.25 These were \nshort introductions to various subjects written by specialists for the lay reader and \npublished by the ALA starting in 1925.\nIn May of 1931, Milam’s expansive plan was conveyed to the ALA membership in \na brief report in the ALA Bulletin from the chairman of the ALA committee on the \nfair. Milam’s four initiatives were included, along with an international library conference\nto be held in Chicago in 1933 and an effort by the ALA to disseminate infor-\nmation about the fair to public libraries nationwide.26 By August of 1932, however, \nthis Plan A, as it came to be called, had been reluctantly dropped in favour of a more \nmodest Plan B, also described in the ALA Bulletin.27 Plan B called for an exhibit space \nof ten by forty feet (3 by 12.2 m), in which pictures and dioramas would illustrate \nhow libraries had changed in one hundred years and how they served people today. \nThe ALA had originally hoped that the fair would give it 3000 square feet (278.7 m2) \nof space for free, but fair officials told the ALA that this was impossible. In response, \nCarl Milam devised the rather clever Plan B, an exhibit that could fit into 400 square \nfeet (37 m2), at a fee of $10 per square foot ($107 per square metre). The ALA fair \ncommittee told the Executive Board that Plan B was ‘ingenious, attractive and practical\nas well as comparatively inexpensive, and [. . .] has been very favorably received \nby the exhibit experts at the Exposition’.28 For a while, it looked as though Milam’s \nPlan B had saved the situation.\nCarl Milam’s Plan B was to fill a 40-foot (12.2 m) section of wall with twenty-five \npictures or dioramas, to be lit in sequence, so as to tell a story. The story begins with \n‘two old gentlemen in front of a bookcase with glass doors’, one of whom examines \na book while the other, holding a set of keys, waits to put it back in its place. This \n', '108 HAL B. GROSSMAN\nis the library of 1833, concerned above all with the preservation of books. The next \nscene shows today’s public library, with ‘well-filled bookcases, books in bright colors, \na woman librarian and a desk. Twelve year old boy receiving a book’. Then we \nwould see the same boy at home reading the book. Similar scenes follow, featuring a \nmechanic in overalls, a young businessman, a ‘Slavic woman in bright shawl’, a young \nmother with a small child, a ‘studious looking man receiving an armful of books’, \nseveral people in a study group or adult education class, and a ‘middle aged man of \nbusiness or professional type’. All of these types of people find the books they need \nand are seen reading them at home. These scenes are followed by four others, showing\nthe interior of a public or school library filled with children, the exterior of a busy \ncollege library, a hospital library book truck and librarian, and a bookmobile in front \nof a country school.29\nMilam felt that his Plan B made financing the exhibit less of a problem, because it \nreduced the ALA’s cost from about $20,000 to between $8000 and $10,000. He wrote \nto Odum, ‘I believe the Executive Board of the Association by hook or crook can \nmanage half of this at least’.30 Odum liked Plan B, which he called a ‘most attractive \nset-up’.31 But, over the course of 1932, the ALA found itself unable to make even the \nsmaller monetary commitment that Plan B required. The fair was accommodating, \neven offering 904 square feet (84 m2) in the Hall of Social Science for the price of 400 \n(37 m2). This extra space could be used for a working library.32 But the fair’s Social \nScience Division could not entirely forgo charging rent. Matters were better financially\nin the Hall of Science, whose organizer was able to offer the ALA free space \nfor a model science library of 1000 books, echoing Isaac Newton to the effect that \n‘We should like to demonstrate to the American public that it is really through the \nlibrary that one man stands upon the shoulders of his predecessors’.33\nWhen Milam presented Plan B to the ALA Council in April 1932, the first response \nwas not about content or format. Instead, Samuel H. Ranck said, ‘I am just a little \ncurious about where the [money] is coming from’.34 Milam had to reply that, ‘I wish \nI could answer that question, but I do not know’. Another Council member thought \nPlan B was ingenious and ought to be very effective, but feared that the fair as a \nwhole would fail to draw visitors, as Philadelphia’s world’s fair of 1926 had failed: \n‘If we are going to have another Philadelphia fiasco, only more so, in Chicago because \nof lack of interest in the country as a whole, is an exhibit going to count for much?’. \nThis member went on to say, ‘I am not trying to be facetious or gloomy, but I am \nthinking of conditions that surround the country at the present time and the general \nlack of interest in expositions as was evidenced in 1926 when we were much more \nbuoyant in spirit than we will be in 1933’.35 Two worries lay behind these remarks. \nThe first was that the economic crisis would lead people to stay at home, rather than \nspend money at the fair. The second was that, quite apart from the state of the \neconomy, the public had lost interest in world’s fairs. It was a widely held belief \nthat the age of world’s fairs had passed, as the failure of the Philadelphia SesquiCentennial\nExposition in 1926 showed; movies, radio, magazines, mail-order cata-\nlogues, and public schools made obsolete the role of fairs in displaying new products \nand ways of living.36\nBy late 1932, the idea that the public was no longer interested in world’s fairs was \nreceding, because the Chicago fair was clearly taking shape nicely and attracting \n', '109UNDERFUNDED AND OUTSHONE\ninterest, but the economy was, if anything, worse. The ALA Executive Board, meeting \non the last day of 1932, declined to authorize the expenditure of about $9000 for space \nand erection of the Plan B exhibit. The exhibits in the fair’s Hall of Science ‘seem to \nhave been able to finance themselves’, the Executive Board was told, and free space \nwas provided there, but money was tighter in the Hall of Social Science. The Executive\nBoard approved an ALA model science library for the Hall of Science, and also \nexpressed the hope that free exhibit space would yet become available in the social \nscience building for Plan B, perhaps because other exhibitors might drop out before \nthe Fair opened in five months’ time.37 In the event, the 1000-book science library was \nassembled outside of ALA auspices, although Milam lent his counsel to this venture. \nThe only representation of the ALA at the fair was the model hospital library in the \nHall of Science, which was so small that it was indexed, but not described, in the \nfair’s official guidebook.38\nThe collapse of Milam’s Plan B must have seemed especially regrettable to him, \nbecause he and the ALA as a body were well aware of the need for libraries to remind \nthe public of their social contributions during the Depression. Almost exactly one \nyear before the Executive Board rejected Plan B, the ALA Council had resolved that \npublic library trustees should do all they could to maintain library funding in the \nface of calls for cuts. Libraries, the Council said, provided ‘essential services which \npromote intelligent thinking and vocational education or re-education and which help \nto keep up the public morale’. In fact, the Depression placed new demands on library \nservices: ‘Economic insecurity breeds intellectual unrest, sending many thoughtful \nmen and women to books, while idleness and lack of funds increase the popularity \nof reading as recreation. The loss of a job makes a man think about his educational \nequipment for another job’.39 But the Depression, which placed new demands on \nlibraries, also rendered the ALA unable to find the money to tell its story at the fair \nin a meaningful way. As early as January 1931, an ALA letter went out to sustaining \nmembers entitled ‘The A.L.A. Emergency’. In the letter, members were told that, \nunless $20,000 could be raised immediately, the ALA would have to curtail such \nprogrammes as library extension, education for librarianship, and adult education.40 \nThis last was the very sort of effort that the Depression made more urgent. Milam \nfought against economic hard times as best he could, but had to admit defeat in the \nend. It may well have been bittersweet for him when, on his fiftieth birthday in 1934, \nas the fair was winding down its second year, Rufus Dawes telegrammed a birthday \nmessage to him: ‘Congratulations on crowding a Century of Progress into fifty \nyears’.41\nThe Library of Congress\nEarlier world’s fairs had benefited from government subsidy, but ‘A Century of \nProgress’ decided early on to rely solely on private funding. The fair was, however, \nconsiderably aided by the decision of the federal government to devote $1 million to \na Federal Building at the fair. The enabling legislation, enacted in February 1932, \nauthorized the federal government to contract with ‘A Century of Progress’ to erect \nits building, which the government did, at a cost of $283,000. The government \nalso decided to employ the fair’s consulting architects to design its building, so as to \npreserve the harmony of the entire Fair.42 The Federal Building became one of the \n', '110 HAL B. GROSSMAN\nmost striking at the fair, with three 150-foot (45.72 m) triangular towers, representing \neach of the three branches of the federal government. The building appeared on a \nthree-cent postage stamp issued in May 1933 (along with a one-cent stamp showing \nFort Dearborn in 1833), providing free publicity for the fair.43\nEighteen federal departments or agencies mounted exhibits in the Federal Building. \nThe largest belonged to the departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Interior and the \nNavy. The smallest and least expensive federal exhibit was that of the Library of \nCongress. While Commerce and Agriculture each got over 6000 square feet (557 m2) \nand $84,000 to spend, the Library of Congress had a mere 231 square feet (21.5 m2) \nand $600 to mount its exhibit.44 This very small budget ‘made it necessary to confine \nthe display to a pictorial representation of the several divisions and activities of the \nLibrary, accompanied by descriptive broadsides’.45 Lenox Lohr’s idea of using movement\nto engage visitors was impossible to realize on such a tiny budget. Instead, the \nLibrary’s exhibit featured a photograph of the frieze at its main building in Washington\non ‘The History of the Book’, a sample of the National Union Catalogue, and a \nsample of the card catalogue with cards representing books on Chicago and Illinois.46 \nThere was also an illustration showing how the Library of Congress related to other \nlibraries in the District of Columbia, and pictures of its planned annex, designed to \nhold 8 million volumes.\nOther initiatives of the Library were also depicted, including its programme of \ncollecting material on American history held by European libraries. The only truly \nfuturistic item in the exhibit was here, in connection with gathering material in \nEurope: ‘One roll of film in viewing camera showing the method of securing reduced \nphotographic facsimiles of documents in European archives’,47 in other words, microfilm.\nIn the 1930s, microfilm promised to transform how research libraries operated, \nopening to their users a new world of information. The Library of Congress stood at \nthe centre of this imagined future, yet microfilm appeared in its 1933 exhibit in a \nstatic fashion, almost as an afterthought. Microphotography had existed, mainly as \na curiosity, since 1859, but it was not until the New York banker George McCarthy \ninvented a rapid rotary microfilm camera for photographing cheques, in 1926, that \nthe process became something that libraries might use.48 Although microfilm as a \nlibrary tool was in its infancy in 1933, a more imaginative and better-funded exhibit \nmight have shown visitors how the process could bring rare materials to any library \nand store hitherto unimagined amounts of information in a small space.\nTime, Incorporated\nAlthough it published magazines rather than providing library service, Time, Inc. is \nrelevant to this discussion because it exhibited what can be called a quasi-library, that \nis, the world’s largest news rack, holding 1500 magazines, and a reading room. Moreover,\nTime, Inc. found a way to make this exhibit into a display that burnished its \nreputation as a publisher of news in a handy, modern, and digested form. In short, \nTime, Inc. succeeded in using its exhibit as an advertisement in a way that the ALA \nand the Library of Congress did not.\nOf the exhibitors discussed here, Time, Inc. was the only one that erected its own \nbuilding. A young Chicago architect named R. Vale Faro came up with the idea of a \nrectangular structure, decorated in an angular pattern that evoked an exotic temple. \n', '111UNDERFUNDED AND OUTSHONE\n‘On each end of the building’, Faro recalled in 1983, ‘there are two pylons with \nsignboards sticking up. One was the cover of Time and the other was the cover \nof Fortune’. When Henry Luce, president of Time, Inc., saw Faro’s design, he was \n‘fascinated’ with it. Faro remembered that ‘People walked into my building and they \ntook off their hats for some reason or other’.49 The temple effect succeeded, and the \ntwo pylons, which carried giant mock-ups of a cover of Time and Fortune magazines \nwith President Franklin Roosevelt on one and Emperor Hirohito of Japan on the \nother, imparted a feeling of currency and dynamism.\nInside the Time-Fortune Building were lounge chairs and the world’s largest \nmagazine rack, with current issues of about 1500 publications from all over the world. \nAt the back was a patio looking out over the manmade lagoon, with chairs, tables, \nand parasols. The building was meant as a place for the weary fairgoer to relax and \nrest, but it also conveyed to visitors a message that was useful to Time, Inc. From its \nfounding in 1923 through to the outbreak of World War II, Time magazine did no \noriginal reporting. Rather, its staff pored over other publications, selecting, digesting, \nrewriting, and arranging news items. What it sacrificed in immediacy, Time magazine \ngained in terseness and vividness of style. Its readers could get a sense of what had \nhappened in the world during the past week in articles written to be easy to digest, \namusing, reassuring to its readers, and sometimes condescending towards its subjects. \nIts younger sibling, Fortune, played a similar role, but with a focus on business and \nthe economy.\nSince Time sold itself as the one essential magazine to read if one wished to be \ninformed, it seems odd at first blush to have provided fairgoers with 1500 other \nmagazines to look at. A partial answer can be found in a press release that ‘A \nCentury of Progress’ issued in May 1934, just before the fair’s second season began, \nand no doubt written by Time, Inc. executives. ‘The largest magazine rack in the \nworld’, 55 feet long, stocked on either side with 1000 North American magazines and \n500 foreign ones, would allow the public to ‘read for themselves what the magazines \nof the world are saying’. A Time, Inc. executive is quoted reminding us that, ‘Until \nrecently, most of us thought and cared little about what foreign nations said of us. \nBut now, with war debts, disarmament, and other dramas of world-wide interest \nbeing enacted on all fronts, foreign news has assumed a new importance’.50 The same \ncould have been said of domestic news; the federal government, in those days of the \nNew Deal, was more active than ever before.\nThe same selling point for the Time-Fortune Building could have been made in \n1933. And one can safely assume that visitors to the pavilion would have been \nimpressed with the diversity of news sources, and perhaps a bit concerned about how \nthey could keep abreast of important developments in the world. No visitor could \nhave been expected to actually use the magazine collection systematically to inform \nhimself, and the building was open for six months only in 1933 and 1934. The implied \nand obvious answer was to read Time magazine, which claimed to stay on top of the \nworld’s press and present to its readers only the most important news of the day. \nWhether Time staffers followed all 1500 magazines on display at Chicago is unlikely, \nbut the visual implication was that they did, that nothing of import in the world \nescaped the eye of Time. This was the magazine collection as selling tool, as advertisement,\nrather than as end in itself. Even those visitors who merely looked over the \nmagazine rack, and then took a rest on the patio, surely got the message.\n', '112 HAL B. GROSSMAN\nThe Time-Fortune Building was a great success, but it almost did not get built. Fair \nofficials courted Time, Inc., both as a potential exhibitor and as a publicity outlet for \nthe fair. As early as March 1928, a fair executive sent Time’s editor a pre-written \nnews item about the fair, which the fair official willingly entrusted to ‘the process \nwhich might be called “terserizing” to which “Time” subjects all things’.51 By late \n1932, fair officials were urging Time, Inc. to commit itself to a building at the fair. \nBut Roy Larsen, Vice President of Time, Inc., was not encouraging. He saw ‘no possibility\nof our taking part in the World’s Fair in view of the fact that it would require \nan appropriation which, in our eyes at least, looks tremendous’. Only some idea that \n‘was so striking that it would be one of the hits of the show’ would change this.52 \nR. Vale Faro’s arresting design proved to be that idea. On 5 December 1932, Henry \nLuce visited the fair site. The fair’s director of exhibits noted before the visit that \n‘Mr Luce is doubtful in his own mind of the ultimate success of the Exposition, and \nespecially of the fulfillment of our estimated attendance’.53 But after meeting Rufus \nDawes, Lenox Lohr, and two architect colleagues of Faro’s, Luce was won over. He \nwrote to Dawes that he ‘was deeply impressed by the possibilities which you have \nevoked and I hope we may have a small part in their realization’.54 The modesty was \nalmost certainly false; Luce wanted and felt he now had ‘one of the hits of the \nshow’.\nTime magazine fitted nicely into the show, too, given the fair’s emphasis on science \nand modernity. A booklet that Time, Inc. issued for the fair asserted that ‘Time is \nnot a magazine but an invention’. Although the printing press had been disseminating \ninformation for centuries, ‘until 1923, no publication and, so far as we know, no man \nhad ever devoted himself to the problem of how to use the printing press to do a \nregular job of getting all the most interesting news of the world into the mind of \nan intelligent man’. Time magazine, which achieves this, ‘is a modern invention \nas surely as the incandescent light is, or the camera’.55 The invention was a great \nsuccess, with Time’s circulation rising from a 1928 total of 189,238 to 420,000 in 1933, \nincluding a recent ‘increase of 1,000 copies a week through more than 150 weeks of \nnation-wide depression’.56\nHenry Luce was by 1933 an important man in the American news media. He was \nalso someone used to getting his way, as shown by an incident shortly before the fair \nopened in 1933. Time’s Chicago representative discovered that a replica nineteenthcentury\nMississippi river steamboat called the Cotton Blossom was anchored in the \nlagoon alongside the Time-Fortune Building. This discovery led to a series of written \ncomplaints from Time, Inc. executives, including Luce, to various fair officials. The \nCotton Blossom, they said, was old-fashioned in its appearance, conflicting with the \nmodern look of the fair, and it was loud in an area meant to be quiet and restful. \n‘The fact that the “Showboat”, calliope-equipped, is moored between the Christian \nScience Reading room and the TIME-FORTUNE Building which will be devoted to \na Library is simply atrocious.’57 Henry Luce telegrammed Lenox Lohr to the same \neffect, with a copy to Lohr’s boss, Rufus Dawes.58 Luce wrote again to Lohr a week \nlater, repeating his complaints in even stronger terms, to the point where the patient \nLohr replied that, ‘while our negotiations with [the showboat’s owners] are in \nprogress, protests and accusations from others are likely to do harm instead of \ngood and may make it impossible for us to secure a satisfactory solution’.59 There the \n', '113UNDERFUNDED AND OUTSHONE\nwritten record ends, and the official 1933 fair map shows the Cotton Blossom \nelsewhere, so apparently Luce got his way in the end.\nRelations with Luce required considerable diplomacy on the part of fair officials. \nAlthough he was pleased with Time, Inc.’s participation in the fair’s 1933 season, \nand his initial reaction was to be back for 1934,60 Luce exasperated fair officials by \ndelaying a formal commitment until the end of 1933. But Time, Inc. did return for \nthe 1934 season. The Time-Fortune Building was a success at selling its magazines to \nthe public, as well as enhancing the sense among corporations that Time and its \nsister publication Fortune were effective advertising vehicles.\nConclusion\nThe two organizations that participated at the fair which were best placed to show \nthe role of the library in society, how this had changed in one hundred years, and \nhow it might evolve in the future were the ALA and the Library of Congress. As we \nhave seen, each was so hampered by lack of funds that neither was able to tell this \nstory effectively. More than this, however, the choices that each made cast doubt on \nwhether more money would have allowed them to capture the imagination of the \nfairgoer of 1933.\nCarl Milam’s Plan B is a case in point. Milam’s basic concept was a strong one \n— that the library of 1833 existed for the preservation of books, whereas the library \nof 1933 was for the dissemination of ideas. His storyboard for Plan B would have \nshown many different kinds of people receiving books at the library, which is fine as \nfar as it goes. But there are other aspects of which Milam was aware that he might \nhave usefully incorporated into Plan B. For example, he wrote in 1934 that ‘about \nfour fifths of our rural population and one third of our total population have no \nlocal public library service’.61 A dynamic map showing areas of the country served by \npublic libraries over time, and the ALA’s hopes for library coverage by, say, 1950, \nwould have been visually powerful and relevant to the fair’s theme of progress. Moreover,\nPlan B might have more explicitly tried to show the usefulness of the public \nlibrary at a time of economic depression. By 1933, the ALA and Milam personally \nwere waging a public relations battle with the desire of many property owners to see \ntheir real estate taxes reduced and public spending cut.62 The fair might have been a \nstage for the ALA to help show why public libraries were worth funding, in spite of \nthe economic downturn.\nThere was a more important element missing from Plan B, which was a look at \nhow science was transforming libraries or might do so in the future. What drew \npeople to the fair was a chance to glimpse a better life ahead, and also to forget their \nmundane cares. The National Young Men’s Christian Association, in a brochure for \nits tours to Chicago in 1933, caught the mood with its promise of ‘Fun, Adventure, \nEducation, a Look Ahead’.63 Milam’s Plan B would not have conveyed this message; \nthe Library of Congress exhibit also failed to depict an exciting future. While libraries\ncould not hope to outdo General Motors, Westinghouse Electric, or the ‘Home \nof the Future’ exhibits at the fair, they could have claimed their rightful share of \nscientific progress and the hope of a brighter tomorrow.\nThe main way in which libraries could have done this is through showing how \nscientific advances might improve library service. Ideas in this vein were available in \n', '114 HAL B. GROSSMAN\n1933. Two examples can be found in a memorandum, one of a long series, prepared \nfor the fair’s Social Science Division. The memo is on ‘Some Social Influences of \nRadio and Broadcasting’,64 but it includes two observations that could have enlivened \na library exhibit. The first is that ‘Broadcasting of book news has helped readers \nin the selection of books and has stimulated new readers. Certain Iowa libraries are \nunable to cope with the demand for new books’. The interplay between radio, libraries,\nand learning was a fruitful topic that went unexplored. This was in spite of Carl \nMilam’s interest in the subject, evidenced by his giving a talk in 1934 on ‘The Relation \nof the Library to Radio Education’.65 The second observation, in the same memorandum,\nis that ‘The method of facsimile reproduction is developing in the sending of \nphotographic likenesses, letters, signatures, and an experimental trial has been \nsuccessful in sending a whole newspaper’. The idea that books and articles could be \nsent from point to point, anywhere in the world, by facsimile or closed-circuit television\nwould have been an exciting addition to a library exhibit. All of Milam’s ficti-\ntious library users in his Plan B scenario find the books that they need; how much \nmore exciting to depict a current problem and its future solution. There might \neven have been a place for aviation in a truly imaginative library display, as a way to \ndeliver books to rural users. The library of the future might also have been shown \nas making films, recorded speech, and music available to its users. The recently \ndeveloped field of standardized testing could also have served: before 1933, C. C. \nWilliamson had predicted that future readers’ advisers would use tests of intelligence, \naptitude, and comprehension to scientifically prescribe a programme of reading to the \nuser.66 A library exhibit where visitors could take a brief test and then be given a list \nof books that ‘fitted’ their profile would have been a much talked-about curiosity. \nPunched cards and tabulating machines were another emerging technology that could \nhave impressed the visitor. In 1936, Louis Round Wilson predicted that the use \nof punched cards and tabulating machines would let libraries see a daily analysis of \ntheir users and of the materials that they consulted.67 This potential to respond to \nuser demand could have been a valuable portion of the ALA’s exhibit about public \nlibraries.\nMicrophotography was another important advance that was shown in a rather \nminimal way by the Library of Congress, and missing altogether from Milam’s \nplanned exhibit for the ALA. Microphotography held out the promise that rare \nmaterials could be made available anywhere, a novel and exciting idea. The use of \nmicrofilm in librarianship had been proposed as early as 1926.68 In 1931, Robert \nBinkley wrote about how microfilm would transform librarianship and compel separate\nlibraries to form ‘library systems’.69 As one writer has put it, ‘Microfilm became \na grande idée in the 1930s for the most dynamic librarians, archivists, and scholars’.70 \nOnly four years after the Chicago fair, an American exhibit at the 1937 Paris exposition\nallowed visitors to see pages being microfilmed and copies made, and to read \nmicrofilm on machine readers. This exhibit was a great success and won a Grand \nPrize.71 To be sure, microphotography was not yet a fully developed technology at \nthe time of the Chicago fair, but the ways in which it might transform the flow of \ninformation were apparent in 1933.\nAnother idea that either the ALA or the Library of Congress might have shown to \nvisitors at Chicago, an idea to which microfilm could act as a servant, was universal \ncataloguing and retrieval of documents. Paul Otlet in Belgium had been working \n', '115UNDERFUNDED AND OUTSHONE\ntoward this goal for forty years. At the 1900 Paris exposition, he showed a collection \nof over two million index cards arranged according to his enhancement of the Dewey \nDecimal System. The ultimate goal was to classify and be able to retrieve all of the \nworld’s knowledge. For his efforts, he and his partner were awarded a Grand Prize \nat the 1900 exposition.72 When combined with microphotography, Otlet’s project of \na universal bibliography promised a dramatic leap forward in making information \navailable to those who needed it. His vision outshone that of the Library of Congress \nat Chicago, which exhibited only a section of its own catalogue cards and a microfilm \ncamera.\nIt may be objected that these ideas were unworkable, or even of questionable \nvalue, but this is to miss the point of exhibiting at ‘A Century of Progress’. Lenox \nLohr expressed it well in 1930, when he argued that fair exhibits must combine \neducation with showmanship. As an example, Lohr used a display put on at an \nagricultural fair by the International Harvester Company, in which metal balls \ndropped onto a finely calibrated surface and bounced up and through metal rings. \nThe exhibit drew large crowds, Lohr said, and was presented as an example of the \naccuracy of which the Harvester Company was capable. This bore no relation to the \nquality of tractors that a farmer might buy, but was a successful piece of advertising \npuffery of the sort that was welcome at the fair.73\nOf the three exhibitors discussed here, Time, Inc. was the only one that understood \nthe uses of showmanship. The ‘world’s largest magazine rack’ was a piece of symbolism,\nimportant for what it said about Time Magazine, just as Harvester’s precision \nbouncing balls mattered for what they said about that company. Visitors to the \nTime-Fortune Building took in the message that Time, Inc. covered the whole world, \nand digested the contents of the 1500 mainly unfamiliar magazines on display. But \nthe ALA, through both lack of imagination and lack of funds, failed to give fair \nvisitors what they came for, which was to be taken out of their ordinary lives and \ntaught something new while being entertained. Of all the library exhibitors at \nChicago in 1933, Time, Inc. best fitted the consumerist model. Each week it printed \nand sold a product, a digest of the week’s news that could enable the reader to appear \nwell informed. Time even presented itself as an invention. Perhaps this fit with the \nfair’s consumerist stance was why the Time-Fortune pavilion succeeded, where the \nALA and the Library of Congress did not.\nNotes\n1 There were other library and book-related exhibits \nat the fair that are not discussed here, such as a \nchildren’s library and story room, a model library of \nscience, and an exhibit of the hundred best books by \nwomen.\n2 Lenox R.
