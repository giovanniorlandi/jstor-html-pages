Stephens in the race\nfor the Democratic nomination for\nthe Senate.\nWith about 86 per cent of the\nvote counted, it is believed that Var\ndanian\'s lead will go to 2,000 and\npossibly higher as the hill precincts\nwhere he is specially strong are al\nways the last to report.\nA run-off is certain between Var\ndaman and Stephens, however as Miss\nKearney with 14,000 votes, counted\nand probably more than 15,000 in\nBight, will prevent either leader from\nhaving a majority.\nWith Vardaman\'s strength show\ning in rural communities and Ste\nphens’ support in the cities, if Var\ndaman has any considerable lead in\nthe first primary, deductions could\npermissibly be made from the fact\nthat hitherto it has been the rural\nrather than the urban vote which\nhas come out strongly in the second\nprimaries in Mississippi..\nTwo sitting congressmen, the vet\neran, Thomas Upton Sisson, and Ross\nCollins, serving his first term, ap\npear defeated. Loper has an appar\nent majority over both Collins and\nMrs. Arnold, their woman opponent.\nLoper entered the race after Collins\nhad charged that Mrs. Arnold\'s hus\nband had negro blood and his can\ndidacy and nomination were a pro\ntest against the character of cam\npaign which ensued.\nJackson, Miss., Aug. 16. — Both\nthe headquarters of Former United\nStates Senator James K. Vardaman\nand Hubert Stephens, former mem\nber of Congress, who, on the face\nof incomplete unofficial returns from\nyesterday’s state-wide primary are\nrunning nip and tuck in the race for\nthe Democratic senatorial nomina\ntion, early today expressed satisfac\ntion with the trend of the returns.\n• “Our returns Indicate that Mr.\nStephens is leading and that he will\nhold his lead but we regard it as a\npossibility that a second primary may\nbe necessary to decide the issue,"\nStephens’ headquarters said shortly\nafter 1 o’clock this morning.\n"The race thus far apparently is\nclose, but with a number of isolated\nsections where Mr. Vardaman will\npoll a heavy vote yet to report, we\nregard the situation as quite favor\nable," Vardaman’s headquarters said\nat the same hour.\nMiss Belie Kearney has carried\nAdams county for U. S. Senator by a\nmajority of 75 votes over her near\nest opponent, Stephens.\nFavored by fair weather over a\ngreater part of the state, on the\nheels of one of the most intense po\nlitical campaigns in years, Mississip\npi Democrats went to the polls in\nforce to express their choice as par\nty nominee between Former Senator\nJames K. Vardaman, Hubert D. Ste\nphens, and members of Congress from\nsix districts and members of the ju\ndiciary.\nEarly reports indicated a heavy\nvote with women exercising their\nrights of franchise for ttlie first time,\nvoting in numbers.\nIn advance of the actual count es\ntimates of the total vote ranged from\n150,000 to 176,000.\nftuin’i Majority 5,362.\nCongressman Quin won majorities\nover his opponent in the following\ncounties\nAmite _ 400\nPike _______. 1,129\nWilkinson _ 300\nCopiah_ 819\nClaiborne _ 574\nJefferson_ 440\nFranklin_ 459\nAdams_1,241\nWall’s majorities over Quin:\nLincoln_197\nWalthall_ 111\nQuin’s majority over Wall for the\nentire District was 5,362.\nIn Lincoln county Vardaman re\nceived 1883 votes, Stephens 1077 and\nMiss Kearney 274.

The\namendment will in no way place a\nsingle mile of Mississippi roads un\nder Federal authority, but will sim\nply transfer the control of Beven per\ncent of the roads from the counties\nto the State Highway Commission,\nwhich is elected by the people, and\nis responsible to the people. They\nhold that the fact, that unless this\naiucuuuicuv ao yaoouu, luiooiootyyt\nwill cease to participate in Federal\naid allotments, alone is sufficient\nreason for its adoption, since this\nwould mean the loss of millions-of\ndollars to this State annually. Fully\nfifty per cent of the road work going\non in Mississippi at present, is being\ndone with the aid of Federal funds,\nbut according to Federal law, unless\nthe State is given control oyer a State\nHighway System, upon which these\nfunds may be expended, these allot\nments will cease. This clause was\nInserted by the Governmnt in the\n1921 appropriations to Insure main\ntenance of newly constructed roads,\nand avoid repetition of the tremen\ndous losses which resulted from im\nproper maintenance of roads built\nwith funds appropriated in 1916.\nAnother very convincing argument\nadvanced by the advocates of the\nproposed change, is that a connected\nState Highway System will be under\nthe control of one central authority,\nand will be managed as a system, and\nnot in small sections of a few miles\nas is done under the present consti\ntution. In this way, the most im\nportant roads will receive the atten\ntion of trained engineers who will\nhave the authority and equipment to\nwatch the roads closely, and act im\nmediately in case of need of repairs.\nThis, it is argued, will relieve the\ncounties of the burden of maintain\ning these roads, and allow them to\ndevote the county tax to roads of less\ner importance, which are at present\nneglected. •—State Highway Depart\nment.\nPLANT A FALL GAEDEN.\nA well-kept vegetable garden is a\nk/v UA VV UV V vu*^ v a. WUb VV VUV\ndener, but of pleasure to the entire\nfamily. For many vegetables which\ndeteriorate rapidly in quality after\nbeing gathered, the only practicable\nmeans of securing the best is to_grow\nthem at home. This is especially\ntrue of many of the vegetables which\nmay be planted during the period\nfrom Aug. 10 to Sept. 10.\ni A half acre garden should produce\n! as much in money value for labor,\ntime and money expended as 2 or 3\nacres in general farm crops.\nIn most sections of our state, tho\nvegetables can be grown in nearly\nevery month of the year, the garden\nis neglected: in fact, no feature of\nour farming systm is more neglected\nthan the production of vegetables for\nhome use.\nFrom Aug. 10 to Sept. 10, the ma\njority of vegetables produced in the\nspring garden, can be planted for fall\ngarden, and will reach maturity be\nfore cold weather. The following\nvegetables can be planted in South\nern Mississippi during August: cab\nI ’cage, turnips, cauliflower, Irish po\ntatoes, salsify, sugar corn, (Aug. 15)\nsnap beans, pole beans, cucumbers,\n(Aug. 15.)\nSeptember:- Spinach, onions, col\nI lards, turnips, English peas, beets,\nradish, mustard, strawberries. The\nfollowing vegetables can be planted\nin Central Mississippi during Aug\nust:- Cabbage (seed), collards, tur\nnips, beets, snap beans (Aug. 15),\npole beans (Aug. 16).\nSeptember:- Carrots, spinach, on\nions, turnips, beets, radish, mustard,\nlettuce, strawberries, celery (plants).\nThe following vegetables can be\nplanted in Northern Mississippi dur\ning August: Collards, beets.\nSeptember:- Carrots, spinach, on\nions, beets, radishes, mustard, let\ntuce, strawberries, celery (plants).\nWhen we realize that such variety\nof vegetables can be grown in our\nfall gardens, is there any logical\nreason for spending our hard earn\ned money for vegetables grown dur\ning these months in the Northern\nStates and shjpped into our Btate\nyielding an enormous profit to the\nseveral agencies which handle them.\nExamination Notioe.\nThe first fall examinations for\nteachers will be held, beginning\nThursday, August 31st.

John A. Penn Dies.\nIt is with profound regret the\nLeader notes the death of Capt. John\nA. Penn, one of the most admirable\ngentlemen and most valiant citizens\nBrookhaven has known. Mr. Penn\npossessed an indomitable spirit, an\nundying energy, a persistent opti\nmism and an abiding loyalty to hie\ndevoted family and the friends who\nhad filled his life with the joy he\nknew and cherished. His presence al\nways brought sunshine and his chiv\nalrous manner, his kindly spirit, per\nmeated always the place he occupied\namong his friends whether the time\nwas long or short, as he passed or\npaused in the long-accustomed paths.\nCapt. Penn was born at Covington,\nLa., Sept. 23, 1843, and spent much\nof his early manhood in New Orleans.\nHe was a Confederate Veteran and\nbelonged to the Seventh l.miisinna\nRegiment and was on Gen. Magee’s\nstaff of the U. C. V.’s. He was gen\nerally . present^ at the meetings of\nSylvester* Gwin\' Camp and- it was al\nways a great deprivation, when he\nwas unable to attend the Confeder\nate re-uniofls of veterans of the 60’b.\nAfter days of patient waiting, Mr.\nPenn’s bright spirit fled on Tuesday\nmorning, Aug. 15th, in the early\nhours of the day. About his bedside\nwere bis wife and children as fol\nlows:- John Penn, of Magnolia;\nBen C., of Greenville; Mrs. I. B. Sta\ncy, of Helena, Ark.; Mrs. S. M. Trip\nlett, Brooksville; Mrs. S. E. Cuney,\nBrookhaven, and several grandchild\nren.\nThe funeral services were observ\ned at the home. Rev. W. H. Lewis\nofficiating in the presence of a large\nnumber of friends and relatives who\nalso attended the casket with its\ncortal clay on its last journey to the\nSilent City of the Dead. Beautiful\nflowers covered the last resting place\nand memories of the long life spent\nin Brookhaven came and went in\nquick succession as realization came\nthat life must go on without him\nwho in his home and in his commun\nity had made large place in the\nhearts of all who knew him.\nMr. Penn was a member of the\nMethodist Church. In his last days\nhe said "I wish I had gone to church\nmore"—"I wish I had read my Bible\nmore." Hfs end was peace.\nSympathy is extended all bereaved\nin the death that has come.\nPlayground Improvement!.\nThe municipal playgrounds is\ngrateful to Mr. Wm.

A former army officer\nprobably will be placed in charge of\nthe provost guard force.\nDuring\'a recent trip to Kansas\nCity, Superintendent Molony inves\ntigated conditions prevailing in that\ncity during last year’s American Le\ngion convention. He discovered that\ncity and police officials of Kansas\nCity had no criticism to make con\ncerning the way in which the 150,\nAAA iriolHn or ov anrvion man nnnHunt.\ned themselves.\nAs proof that the men did nothing\ndistasteful, Superintendent Molony\nSyiid Kansas eity officials would wel\ncome the opportunity to have the or\nganization again choose Kansas City\nas their convention city. In fact,\nKansas City endeavored to have this\nyear’s convention held there.\nCotton Yield to be Cut.\nJackson, Miss., Aug. 13.—"Thirty\ndays ago," says Edward Ruff, dis\ntrict agent in farm demonstration\nwork for South Mississippi, "farm\ners had the most promising cotton\ncrop 1 ever saw, but since the ad\nvent of the boll weevil their hopes\nhave been dashed to pieces, and the\ndisappointment of these farmers who\nhave depended on cotton for their\nmoney crop is great. In two weeks\nthe boll weevil has appeared in un\nprecedented numbers and in the late\nfields damage has been heavy. Up\nto this time the farmers have had lit\ntle to say about truck and feed crops\nfor next year, but they are now be\nginning to make serious inquiries\nand are manifesting considerable in\nterest in cash crops.”\nIt has been shown that the best\ncash crops for South Mississippi are\nvegetables, dairying and hogs. The\ndairy farming communities are all\nprosperous, and that industry is be\ncoming more and more important ev\nery year.\nThe sweet potato crop is fine, and\nalready a number of carloads have\nbeen shipped north or into the Delta\ncountry at $1 a bushel net to the\ngrower. The sugar cane crop is al\nso great and promises large yields of\nsyrup next fall. Steps are being tak\nen to standardize as great a quantity\nof the syrup as the public demands\nand small containers will be more\ngenerally used.\nDairy Industry Backed at Gloster.\nGloster, Miss., Aug. 12. — Under\nthe auspices of the Gloster Board of\nTrade ail dairymen of this territory\nwere entertained at a luncheon here\nyesterday. O. P. McPherson, secre\ntary of the Board of Trade, who wae\nmaster of ceremonies, introduced the\nspeakers of the day, as follows: H.\nB. Gammel, Gloster; Archibald\nSmith, Natchez; B. B. Hall of the\nHall-Toler Pecan Growers, Gloster;\nF. F. Becker, of the Brookhaven\nCreamery company, and tne promo\nter of the dairy industry of this sec\ntion. Charles Dewey of Centreville,\none of the most successful dairymen\nof the state, delivered an interesting\ntalk.\nSeveral of the large plantation\nowners wish to sell oft the greatei\npart of the large tracts and convert\nit all into dairying, and all South\nwest Mississippi otters great oppor\ntunities in this connection, it was\nannounced.\nGloster has erected a creamery and\nmachinery will be installed as soon\nas ample cream production is as\nsured.\n666 quickly relieves Colds, Con\nstipation, Biliousness and Head\naches.

No past year has ever pro\nduced a season of baseball in Brook\nhaven wherein a team of more ca\npable players on the diamond or more\ngentlemanly fellows to have in our\nhomes, represented our city.\' "It’s\ndoubtful, indeed, if the future will\nmaterialise a duplicate.\nBrookhaven should be—and is —\nproud of its team and proud of its\nrecord of cleanly gained victories.\nBut prouder yet should Brookhaven\nbe of the Individual units of its\nteam; and yet still prouder -of the\ncivic spirit and social atmosphere\nthat attracted and held only those\nplayers of sufficient high character\nand breeding who could feel natural\nand at ease in environment where\nthe moral tone and social i>lane ap\npeal only to the best.\nPraising the officials of the Brook\nhaven Baseball Association is like\ntrying to paint the lily or finding a\nsuperlative ior periect.\nJ. W. McGrath, president of the\nbaseball association is a most prom\ninent figure in the business and bo\ncial circles of Mississippi and Lou\nisiana. Bear hunting with Ir\nvin Cobb and other world-wide\ncelebrities is ordinary diversion\nfor Mr. McGrath; hobnobbing\nwith world-famed Thespians at the\nexclusive Lamb\'s Club in New York\nis a common matter with him. And\nyet he is more enthused over* enter\ntaining members of Brookhaven’s\nbaseball team and looking after the\nwelfare of the players than he’d be\nin banqueting with royalty.\nSheriff R. C. Applewhite—"Uncle\nBob" to the players—is pal, parent,\nand provider to every man on the\nteam, looking after the boys oft the\ndiamond as well as on the playing\nfield.\nEd Guess has neglected his cloth\ning business in order that be might\ngive of his time and attention to the\ninterest of the baseball team.\n"Bully” Mayfield ~has deserted his\npool parlors for days at a time to\nlook after the needs of the boys on\ndistant trips.\n“Pat” Farrell has waved a care\nfree hand at his ice cream factory\nand gone gladly forth with the team\nin enemy territory on more than one\noccasion.\nT. C. Brister has burned much of\nhis own oil far beyond the midnight\nhour trying to catch up with neglect\ned personal affairs discarded in day\ntime to attend to baseball matters.\nM. R. "Si" Powers has been of\nmore help and assistance than many\nof the fans have suspected, with\nsuggestions to the other directors,\nwords of encouragement and advice\nto the players with an understanding\nand sympathy the boys have greatly\nappreciated.\nTo mention the fans, business and\nprofessional men and all others who\nhave aided in making the season such\na success would be to name every\nman, woman and child in the com\nmunity. No other city in the world\nhas ever been so ever ready and eager\nto respond to every call, from dig\nging in their pockets for the where\nwith to finance the team to chipping\nin for funds to entertain the boys,\nas Brookhaven. The city is absolute\nly in a class by itself. And. no other\ncity on God’s green globe can boast\nof such an abundance of young and\nfascinating femininity, as well as\nattractive matrons, with their loyal\nrooting and unwavering support of\nthe Brookhaven team, that has been\nshown throughout the entire season.\nAnd the team? No nicer aggre\ngation of players were ever assem\nbled on a ball field than the \'pien un\nder Manager Hamilton Fish. Take\nthem separately or collectively and\nthey will loom above the average\nbaseball player or ball team like Mr.\nShasta looms above the little hills of\nSiskyou. The season opened with\nHam Fish;* Charley Miller, F. A. Hol\nlingsworth, Stick Williams, Buck\nJones, Tony Weeks, Joe Untz, Clem\nFos, Pete Castaing, Eric Eckardt,\nTom Cupit. The same men are here\nnow, with the exeception of a few—\nand to them have been added Calvin\nBarbour, “Slim” Magers, "Smiling”\nVardanian, "Pole” Jenkins, “Flash”\nHunnicutt. A few others lingered\nfor a short while but found the go\ning too swift.\nEach day brings offers from league\nclubs for some of our Brookhaven\nplayers. These offers were, in the\nmain, ignored during the mid-season;\nbut now that our season is fast\ndrawing to a close, some of the boys\nare leaving for clubs where the sea\nson will be much longer.\nJoe Untz has departed for Nash\nville; .Tony Weeks reports today to\nChattanooga; Pete Castaing has been\nwith Jackson for some time.\nFos and Magers are going up next\nyear. A Cleveland scout has arrang\ned for these two to go with the\nCleveland Club on its spring training\ntrip next April, and has also prom\nised each a season in class "A” oi\nclass “B” company in 1923. Friendt\nof Fob and i..agers are sorry to know\nthey will not be back with us nex1\nyear, but aie glad the boys will gel\ntheir chance in the big circuits.\nThe Brookhaven team of 1922\nmade a wonderful record. To date\nthe boys have won 45 games and losl\n15, for an average of 750. In othei\nwords the Brookhaven team has wor\nthree times as many games as thej\nhave lost. They broke fifty-fifty ir\ngames with organized ball, losing twc\nto Chattanooga of the Southerr\nLeague and beating • Jackson anc\nGreenville of the Cotton States cir\ncuit.\nA MERCILESS JUDGE\nOne Who Shows No Favor.\nA merciless judge is Father\nTime. Before him the weak anc\nthe wanting go to the wall. Onlj\nthe truth can stand. For years\nthe following statement from i\nBrookhaven resident has with\nstood this sternest of all tests.\nC. E. McFarland, 533 Schwen\nAve., Brookhaven, says: “Mj\nkidneys troubled me and mj\nback was lame and sore. The\nkidney secretions were profust\nin passage. I knew the troublt\nwas caused from my kidneys anc\nas a friend advised me to trj\nDoan’s Kidney Pills I got a box\nDoan’s helped me from the starl\nso I kept on with them until ]\nwas cured.’ \' (Statement giver\nJanuary 28, 1918.)\nOn March 11, 1922, Mr. Me\nFarland added: “Since usinj\nDoan’s Kidney Pills in 1918 J\nhave had no kidney trouble be\ncause Doan’s have completed\ncured me.”\n60c, at all dealers.

Miss., Aug. 12.—\nA disastrous lire and one which for\na while threatened the entire busi\nness district of the town occurred\nhere Thursday night when three\nbuildings on Georgetown street own\ned by S. H. Aby, the venerable edi\ntbr of the Meteor, the town’s local\nnewspaper, were destroyed by Are\nand the building occupied by the\nCumberland Telephone Company was\ncompletely gutted.\nThe alarm of Are was turned in\nat 2 o’clock when Night Watchman\nBarron, making his rounds, discov\nered Are in the meat market owned\nby Wade Frasier. The Are depart\nment responded promptly but too\nlate to save the market. The Are\nate its way through the market and\ninto and through the grocery store\nof Adolphus Evans, and into the\nbuilding occupied by The Meteor and\njn to the telephone building. All\nbusiness buildings were completely\ndestroyed except the telephone build\ning and that was burned beyond hope\nof repair.\nFrasier, owning the medt maiket,\nEvans, owning the grocery store,\nJack Barlow, owning a pop stand\nand The Meteor lost everything.\nBarlow, Evans, and Frasier had no\ninsurance and The Meteor had only\n$800. The service given by the pow\ner plant was magnificent, the best\nkind of water service being given\nand that alone is what saved the en\ntire business block.\nWhen the flames reached the brick\nbuildings awned by W. B. Lockwood,\nthe big stream was a very short time\nin putting It out.\nThe files of The Meteor for forty\nyears back were destroyed. The\ntown was cut off from telephone set\nvice until late into the day Friday.\nThe loss of Mr. Aby, editor of The\nMeteor, is very heavy. The frame\nbuildings occupied prominent loca\ntions in the business district and\nthese will be replaced by modern\nbrick buildings. _\nBetter Printing at The Leader.\nMUCH BUILDING\nON THE EAST SIDE\nNew Business Places Soon—In\nvestment Shows Faith in\nBrookhaven’s Future.\nEvery visitor to Brookhaven is no\nting the extensive building going on\naround the First National Bank\nbuilding that stands on the corner\nof E.

The pur\nchasing power of the wages of the\ncoal miner in 1921 was 30 per cent\ngreater than in 1913. The purchas\ning power of the farm hand who\nworks for wages in 1921 was 4 per\ncent less than in 1913, while the\npurchasing power of the farmer him\nself was on an average from 25 to\n45 Der cent less than in 1913 ”\n“In short,” Mr. Wallace empha\nsized, “the farmerB of the country,\nnumbering almost one third of our\nentire population, having borne alto\ngether the heaviest burden of defla\ntion. They have endeavored to gain\nrelief by all lawful means. They\nhave appealed to the administration,\nto Congress and every other agency\nwhich they thought might be able\nto help them, but \'w^ile making these\nefforts to avoid heavy losses they\nhave not struck. They have not\ncreated disorders. They have kept\noh producing and in the face ot\nextraordinaryily low prices have this\nyear grown one of the largest crops\nin our history. The farmer believes\nin fairness between man and man. Ho\nbelieves in working hard and pro\nducing efficiently.\n"If other groups will do as the\'\nfarmer has done, our economic prob\nlems would soon be solved. Prices\nwould be adjusted to their normal re\nlationship. There would be work for\neverybody and at just wages.\n“If the various groups in this\ncountry are determined to prey on\none another and abandon law and or\nder for strong arm methods, the\nfarmer can take care of himself. He\ncan reduce his production to his own\nneeds. He can follow the example of\nsome others and refuse to sell what\nhe produces. But he does not be\nlieve in that sort of thing. He\nknows that such a policy would bring\nabout in this great republic exactly\nthe same sort of conditions that ex\nist in Russia.”\nCotton Worm Spreading.\nA. & M.

Harned, State\nEntomologist, best results are ob\ntained when the worms first appear\nand are still very small, as they are\nmore easily. poisoned at that stage.\nGrowers* that are poisoning the wee\nvil with calcium arsenate dust need\nhave no fear of the worms.\nWhether it will pay to poison the\nworms or not is a question which\neach grower should decide for him\nself. Where cotton is still growing\nand fruiting with plenty of blooms\nand young bolls, the poison should\nbe applied without delay. But In\nfields heavily infested with the boll\nweevil, with no bloom showing and\nmost of the young bolls punctured,\nit is very doubtful if it will pay.\nIn very rank cotton, especially where\na considerable amount of boll rot is\npresent,. stripping of the leaves by\nthe worms may stop the rotting and\npoisoning would be of no benefit.\nA shortage of calcium arsenate and\nlead arsenate, the poisons most gen\nerally used, is also causing uneasi\nness in some sections. Where these\npoisons cannot be obtained growers\nmay be able to secure Paris Green,\nLondon Purple, magnesium arsenate,\nor zinc arsenite, which may be used\ninstead. An equal weight of lime\nshould be mixed with most of\' these\nto avoid burning the plants. More\nspecific directions about using these\nmay be secured by writing the En\ntomologist, State Plant Board, A. &\nM.
