Wiley, former chief chem\nist of the Department of Agriculture.\n"Iu agriculture we are fully fifty\nyears behind Kurope. and the better\nutilization of our farm resources is one\nof the most important problems before\nthe country.\n"Old fashioned, slipshod methods of\nproducing wheat and cotton and corn\nare still in vogue in over 15 per cent\nof the country devoted to these indus\ntries.\' said Dr. Wiley, continuing his\nItnjieachment of our las farming\nmethods. "The growiug of these\ncrops until within a few years could\nuot have been ranked as agriculture,\nbut should have been described as\nhighway robbery of the soil. As a re\nsult the average production per acre of\n.hese crops has fallen to a minimum.\n"Farming, for one thing, must be\nmade more attractive. It should be\nmade more profitable. This will be\ndone as our farmers learn more thor-\nrotation r crops.\n"To this end 1 have been preaching\nfor the past thirty years the gospel of\nthe sugar leet.\n"The production of the sugar beet\nrequires the highest style of intensive\nculture that science has been able to\nDR.

The\nsoil and climatic conditions in the great\ner part of the United States are thor\noughly favorable to beet culture, and\nAmerica is the greatest sugar market\nin the world.\n"In the case of the sugar beet the\ncrops which are grown in rotation with\nit yield very much larger returns than i\nwhen the old f.-ishioued svsteuj of agri- i\nculture prevailed. The reflex ac tiou of\nthis influence becomes u benetit to\nAmerican agriculture the value of\nwhich it would be difficult to measure\nin dollars and cents.\n"Wherever the sugar beet is culti\nvated the farmers are all prosperous,\nno matter what kind of other crops\nthey raise.
