        <pre>['A.\nOL. XXXVIII MANNING, S. C., WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 9,1918\nPRESIDENT PUT\nDIRECT QUE\n\'GERM\nor ermany His Reply to Chancellor\nax Spells Unconditional\nSurrender\nb AltST WITHDRAW FROM\nALL INVADED TERRITORY\nChancellor Max Must Say Whom He\nRepresents and What He Means\nby Accepting the President\'s 14\nPrinciples-It. All Means Sur\nrender Now or Hereafter.\nIs Germany Now Ready to\nLay Down?\nHerewith is the text of the Presi\nlent\'s note of inquiry transmitted to\nGermany today through the charge de\naffairs of Switzerland:\nDepartment of State, October 8,-18,\nSir:\nI have the honor to acknowledge; on\nbehalf of the President your note of\nOctober 6, enclosing a communication\nfrom the German governnent to the\nPresident; I am instructe:l by the\nPresident to request you to make the\nfollowing communication to the Im\n,perial German Chancellor.\n"Before making reply to the request\nof the Imperial German government\nand in order that that reply shall be\nas candid and straightforward as the\nmomentous interests involved require,\nthe President of the United States\ndeems it necessary to assure himself\nof the exact meaning of the note of\nthe fmperial Chancellor. Does the Im\nperial Chancellor mean that the Im\nperial German government accepts\nthe terms laid down by the President\nin his address to the Congress of the\nUnited States on thu tghth of Janu\nary last and in subsequent addresses\nand that its object in entering into\ndiscussions would be only to agree up\non the practical details of their ap\nplication ?\n"The President feels bound to say\nwith regard to the suggestion of an\n6 armitice that he would not feel at\nliberty to propose a cessi ion of-arms\nto the governments with which the\ngovernment of the United States is\nass.)c:ated against the Central Pow\ners as long as the armies of those\npowers gre upon their Soil. The good\nfaith of any discussion would mani\nfestly depend upon the consent of the\ncentral Powers immediately to with\ndraw their forces everywhere from in.\nvaded territory.\n"The President also feels that he i<\njustified in asking whether the Imper.\nial Chancellor is speaking merely for\nthe constituted authorities of the em\npire who have so far conducted th<\nwar. le deems the answers to thest\nquestions vital from every point o\'\nvie-v\nWhat Wilson\'s Fourteen Principle\nAre--As Given\nThe following are the fourteen prin\n-iples of President Wilson to which\nChancellor Max refers:\n1. Open covenants of peace, openly\narrivedl at, after which there shal\nbe no private international unde\nstandings of any kind, but dliplo,\nmnacy shall proceed alwvays frankl3\nand in the public view.\n2. Absolute freedom of navigatier\nupon the seas, outside of territorial\nw-~atei\'s, alike in peace andl in war, ex\ncept as the seas may be closed ir\nwhole or in part by international ac\ntion for the enforcement of interna.\ntional covenants.\n3. The removal, as far as possible\nof all economic harriers and the es\ntabli5:hment of any equality of tr-ad,\nconditions among all the nations con.\nsenitiirg to the peace and associatina\nthemsrelves together for its mainten.\nance.\n-. Adequate guarantees given an(.\ntaken th\'at national armaments wvill b(\nreduced to the lowest point consisteni\nwith dlomestic safety.\n5. A free, open-minded andl abso.\nlutiely impartial adjustment (if all\ncoloniai claims, based upon a s-t rict ob\nservance of the principle that in de\ntermining all such questions (of sov\nereignty the interests of the popula\ntions concerned must have equal\nwe(ight with the equitable claims of\nthe government whose- title is to be\ndeterminedl.\nS6. The evacuation of all Russian,\nterritory andl such a settlement of all\nquestions affecting Russia as will se..\ncure the best -andl freest co-operation\nof the other nations of the wvorld in\njbtaininig for her an, unhampered and\nunembarrassed oportunity fr.h ian\nS UP THREE\nTIOWS TO THE\nAN CHANCELLOR\ndependent determination of her own\npolitical development and national\npolicy and assure her of a sincere\nwelcome into the society of free na\ntions under instikations of her own\nchoosing; and also of every kind that\nshe may need and may herself desire.\nThe ti-eatment accorded Russia by her\nsister nations in the months to come\nwill be the acid test of their good\nwill, of their comprehension of her\nnee:ds as (listijguished from their own\ninterests and of their intelligent and\nunselfish sympathy.\n7. Belgium, the whole world will\nagree, must. be evacuated and re\nstoitd, without any attempt to limit\nthe sovereignty which she enjoys in\ncommon with all other free nations.\nNo other single act will serve as this\nwill serve to restore confidence among\nthe nations in the laws which they\nhave themselves set and determined\nfor the government of their relations\nwith one another. Without this heal\ning act the whole structure and validi\nty of international law is forever im\npaired.\n8. All French territory should be\nfreed and the invaded portions re\nstored, and the wrong (lone to\nFrance by Prussia in 1871 in the\nmatter of Alsace-Lor-aine, which has\nunsettled the peace of the world for\nnearly fifty years, should be righted,\nin order that peace may be to the in\nterest of all.\n9. A readjustment of the frontiers\nof Italy should be effected along\nclearly recognizable lines of national\nity.\n10. \'\'he peoples of Austria-Hun\ngary, whose place among the nation:\nwe wish to see safeguarded and as\nsured, should be accorded the freest\nopportunity of autonomous develop\nment.\n11. Roumania, Servia. and Monte\nneg ro should be evacuated, occupied\nterrit ries restored, Serbia accorded\nfree and secure access to the sea and\nthe relations of the several Balkan\nstates to be determined by friendly\ncounsel along historically established\nlines of allegiance and nationality and\ninternational guarantees of the politi\ncal and economic independence and\nterritorial integrity of the several\nBalkan states shuld be entered into.\n12. The Turkish portions of the\npresent Ottoman empire should be as\nsured a secure sovereignty, but the\nother nationalities which are now un\nder Turkish rule should be assured an\nundoubted security of life and an ab\nsolutely unmolested opportunity of au\ntonomous development, and the Dar\ndenelles should be permanently opened\nas ajfree passage to ships and com\nmerce of al nations under internation\nal guarantees.\n13. An independent Polish state\nshould be erected, which should in\nclude the territories inhabited by in\ndisputable Polish populations, which\nshouild be assured a free andl secure\naccess to the sea, andi whose political\nand~ economic independence and terri\ntorial integrity should be guaranteed\'\nby inter-national covenant.\n14. A general association of na\ntions must be formed under specific\ncovenants for the purpose of afford\ning mutual guarantees of political in\ndlependlence and territorial integrity\nto great and small states alike.\nBERLIN EXCITED)LY\nWAITS ON WILSON\nCopenhagen, O-t. 8.--Helbiin, aec\ncordling to all (dispatches from the\nGecruman capital, is awaiting excitedlyr\nfor President Wilson\'s reply to the\npcite offt r.\nThue reichistag has been sumtmoned!\nfor- Thursday to (discuss peace pre -\nsumably because the American re.ply\nis expected to have reached Berlin by\nthat time.\nTfhe German press showvs a t-n den\ney towvard preparing ,the populace for\nthe rejection of the peace proposarl.\nCOUPI D)\'ETrAT INTED\nAT IN VIENNA\nAmsterdam, Oct. &.-RIound\'about\ndisoatches from \\\' enna hint at the\nimminence of a coup dl-etat by the op\nposition party.

During the past sea\nson the acreage was considerably in\ncreased. Many farmers have suffi\nC cient wheat for home use.\nWhen the present price of flour anti\nthe probability that it cannot be pur\nchased at any price, as the war ad\nvances, are considered, all farmers I\nshould appreciate the importance of f\nmaking preparations for producing a t\n{ sufficient amount of wheat to supply\nthe entire amount needed for home\nconsumption.\ns If you are going to sow -.vheat do\nnot sow in the spring. Ita is a waste\nof seed. The safest policy is to have i\neverything in readiness to seed im\nmediately after the first killing frost. e\nSome growers use one bushel of c\nseed per acre, others use six pecks. a\na It is believed that this latter amount s\nof the varieties recommended for the a\n.
