For the ultimate redemr .\ntion of these current expense bonds sn\nfar, no provision has been made; unle.\nsuch provision be contained iln section\n1 and 72 of chapter 58, laws of 1899, er.\ntitled: "An act to. provide for the iv\nfunding of the bonded indebtedness\ntne tei-ritoiry of New Mexico and the\nvarious counties and the municipalit,.;s\nthereof."\nSecition 12 reads as follows:\n"That at any time whan ainy out\nstanding bond or bonds, or any portion\nthereof olf this territory, may have be\ncome redeemable at the option of the\nterritory and the holder or holdia\nthereof fail, neglect or refuse to sur\nrender the same, under the pi\'ioivisi.ir.s\nof this act, then it shall be lawful for\nthe territory to issue bondls as herti\'i\nprovided, and the treasurer, with th\napproval of the governor of the terri\ntory, shall have authority to dispose of\nthe same for cash, at no lass than par,\nand out of the procad,s thereof, taki-\nup any such outstanding bonds, or any\nportilon theretof, that may bear a higher\nrate of Unltereflt than herein provided.\'\netc.\nI hardly think that it would be ad\nvisable to raise the present rate of tax\nation and make a special levy sufflcte\'it\nto pay these current expense bonds on\nmaturity.

C. de Baca has taken a stand\nagainst foot ball as being encouraged\nand offlciallly recognized by the Herri\ntorial institutions. He is taking an ut:\npopular position, but in his reason for\nhte view he is correct. Foot ball is more\nbrutal than prize fighting, and there are\nother sports and olthef games whiitah are\nmore ennobling and offer just as much\nopportunity for athletic exercise thin\ntoot ball. The old-time athletic com\npetitions, foot racing, wrestling, fenc\nlng and the modern games of base bail,\ncricket, tennis and golf are far more\nbeneficial from the point of athiletllcs, as\nwell as from the standpoint of morals\nand Imtedlectual Influence.\nThe tramp i.uestlon is becoming a so.\nrious one, van in New Mexico.

Sa,id an English maga\nzine: "To prove that this century lis un\nequaled by any olf the preceding ones,\nespecially in England, we need but re\nmark thait it boasts a Newton, Locke,\nJohnson;" a Handel, Wren, Chambers,\nPeymoldis, Henway, Howard, and many\nothers.!\'\nBut the youthful American-journals\nwere more pessimistic for the Baltimore\nGazette saiid at the beginning of ths\nnineteenth century:\n"Of allll this vast continent, which\ncomprises more than a fourth of the\nglobe, that part which we have the fe\nlicity to inhabit greatly anticipates the\nrest.

The\npay of the United States marshal is\n$5000 per annum, with office rent and\notlher perquisites; the pay of disttlilot at\ntorney Is $5000 per annum, with ofllcR\nrant and other perquisites; the pay of\nland office officials (and It is understood\nthat they are receiving the maximum)\nis $3030; tlhe postmasters in the large\ntowns find cities all receive very good\nsallarios. The pay from the United\nStates to justices of the territorial su\npreme court is $2500 per annum, with no\nperquisites for traveling or other ex\npenses. In the minds of sensible people\nthere is no question that tlhe duties of\nthe federal judges, who also perform\nthe duties of judges, of the district\ncourts, are of much more importance to\nthe welll-ibeing of the community than\nthose of any of the officiate named;\nhence, considering the insufficiency of\ntheir salaries as fixed by the Untied\nStates and the importance of the d\'i\nties which they perform, the legislative\nassembly of the territory has iseen ft\ntor a food many yeara to allow fedenil\njudges $800 per annum out of the terri\ntorial treasury. This has been done by\nRepublican and Democratic tegllsHatlve\nassemblies and to Republican and Dem\nocratic judges alike. No territorial con\nventlon for the past twenty yelara held\nby either party has disapproved this ac\ntion. The people alt large not only do\nnot disapprove it, but reallly favor It.\nThe cutting of It would be false econo\nmy, and while productive of nio harm\nlcause the judges would perform thMr\nduties ati carefully, honestly and effl-\nclenltly ais they do now, sUII Ct would\nbe unjust and productive of no good.\nThe position taken by the CltJBen In\nthis matter may please that paper,\nprobabjy it does, but the people take no\nstock In it, and do not Indorse it.\nGOVERNMENT\nINDIAN SCHOOLS,\nMiss Estelle Reed in Her Annual Re\nport; Makes Some Important\nRecommendations.\nTHE SCHOOL AT SANTA FE.\nA Decided Improvement is Noticeable in\nthe Industrial Features of the Institution-The\nChildren Well-Clothed,\nBright and Happy.\nMiss Estelle Reel, superintendent of\nth Indian schools maintained! by the\ngovernment, in her report speaks as\nfollows of the government school at\nSnnta Fe: "A decided improvement Is\nnoticeable in the industrial features of\nthis school over those of last year. The\ncarpenter shop has been enlarged, and\na large detail of boys is receiving In\nstruction in this branch of training.\nThe blacksmith shop Is doing good\nwork, as are also the shoemaking ant\ntailor shops. Practical instruction, is\nalso given by the farmer, and if a suf\nficient supply of water could be had a:\nthis smTinol. considerable work could be\ndone along agricultural lines. The\nteaching of irrigation Is very rmpo.\ntnn in this section, as in order to raise\nanything to the pueblos in the victni-y\nthe land has to be irrigated. I founu tne\np-eneral condition of the school to b;\nsatisfactory, and the children w?l\'.\nclothed, bright and happy. The number\nof day schools that are now placed in\ncharge of the superintendent Of this\nschool make it possible for the Indian\ncKnn.i sit Santa Feto receive each yeu\na large number of students who are\nadvanced beyond the primary grade.\n"Two eood day schools are located u.i\nNambe and Tesuque, which are a few\nmiles from Santa Fe.\nTn addition to giving these data, Miss\nReel discusses in an interesting wav\nthe condition, the needs, and the pros\npects of the Indian schools, treating the\nIndian question in a clear manner and\nfrom nractical ooint of view.\nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING.\nMis Reel emphasizes the overshad\nowing importance of industrial trai l\ning tar both boys and girls. "The boys\nshould be taught stockraising and\nfarming, and given a sufficient knowl\nedge of tools to enable them to mend\ntheir wagons and farm implements and\nshoe their horses, and the girls should\nbe trained in the art of practical house\nkeeping. The teaching of the household\nduties to the girls is even more impor\ntant :1ian industrial training for t\'\'e\nboys, says Miss Reel, for with the fu\nture wives and mothers will rest the\nfate of coming generations. The Indiin\nchild should be given a knowledge jf\nthe English language, but It is not wise\nto spend years over subjects for which,\n:n all probability, he will have no u.w.\nin inter life. The problem now before\nus is the selection of the beat method\nfor transforming the Indian from a\nrnnanmer Into a oroducer. He must be\nbrought to the point where he will have\nrespect for the dignity of labor ar.n\nwhere he will have the ambition to sup\nport his famlly-and not look to the gov\nermmervt for help. The moment we can\nInduce the Indian to labor voluntarily\nfor his own welfare, from that moment\nhis future will be assured. This point\nwill be reached only through patien;\napplication and faithful work along in\nduistJrial lines."\nThe superintendent strongly ihdorsts\nthe outing system as one of the most\neffective means of training the children\nin habits of civilized life. The outing\nsystem, which originated with MajO\'\nPratt, of the Carlisle school, Pemnsyl\nvania, consists in placing the IndLan\nchildren in good white homes, where\nthey will be treated as one of the fam\nily and paid a small sum for their setv\nices. Here they are constantly subj-wt\nto influences Of the most practical na\nture, and acquire habits of right living.\nThe property ownership plan has a\nprominent place In Miss Reel\' system\nof training, and the cultivation of bat\nter crops and more acres of land Is\nconstantly urged. Miss Reel also plead?\nthat a compulsory education laiw for\nthe Indian be enacted and enforced. She\nrecites the difficulty and often impossi\nbility of inducing the old Indians to at\ntend school, and says the future of\nthese children should not be Wasted by\nthe superstitious ignorance anO. preju\ndice of the parents.\nCLIMATE IS FATE.\nOne of the Most Interesting Books on New\nMexico Ever Published.\n(Roswell Register.)\nOne of the most interesting books on\nNew Mexico and dte healthfullness is\nCol.
