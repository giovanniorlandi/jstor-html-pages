JUNE 16. 1916\nNUMBER 24\nAND STOLE HORSES\nNow in Jail at Moscow Facing\nCharge\nOlaf Olson, about 25 years of age,\nwho has been employed as a farm\nlaborer on Big Bear ridge for the\npast three or four years, is in the\ncounty jail at Moscow to answer to\nthe charge of grand larceny and\narson.\nIt seems Olson took a team of\nhorses belonging to W. L. Blenden,\na farmer on Big Bear ridge, tied\nthese horses in the stable of another\nfarmer named Swensen, set fire to\nthe building and brought the Swen\nsen horses to Kendrick where they\nwere recovered when Olson was\narrested.\nThe Swensen barn was burned\nabout three o\'clock A. M. Wednes\nday June 7, and was acomplete loss.\nThe carcasses of the horses were\nalmost consumed and while Mr\nSwensen could not explain the cause\nof the fire it was not until well into\nWednesday afternoon that he dis\ncovered that the horses burned\nwere not his. This discovery was\nmade because the hoofs of the\nhorses burned carried no shoes\nwhile his horses were newly shod.\nMr. Blenden missed his horses in\nthe pasture Wednesday morning and\nwhen the report of the Swensen\nincident gained circulation, he\nvisited the Swensen ranch and\nidentified the burned horses, the\nidentification being made by the\ncondition and shape of the hoofs.\nThe hunt for the missing Swensen\nhorses was then commenced and\nthey were located in a private barn\nhere where they had been placed by\nOlson.\nWhen Olson was placed under ar\nrest, he had little to say about how\nhe came into possession of the Swen\nsen horses and declined to discuss\nthe burning of the barn or the\ndisappearance of the Blenden horses.\n"Titanic Wheat"\nThe department has recently been\nadvised by a correspondent in Cali\nfornia that a variety of wheat is\nbeing advertised under the name\n"Titanic." The assertion is made\nthat it is a new variety of wheat dis\ncovered in England four years ago\nand that a small quantity of seed\nwas brought to the United States\nby one of the survivors of the ill\nfated Titantic. The wheat is repre\nsented as having extremely high\nyielding power, the returns reach\ning as high as 7,000-fold. A photo\ngraph sent by this correspondent |\nshows a head identical in appear\nance with the widely exploited\n"Alaska" wheat. Five acres of the\nwheat are said to be growing in the\nHate of Washington, and the seed,\n\'"It is believed, will be offered at\nhigh prices after harvest. The\ndepartment has no futher or more\ndefinite information concerning this\nvariety, but farmers and dealers are\ncautioned to be on their guard con\ncerning this new exploitation.\nMiss Verline Emmett of Little\nBear ridge is visiting a few days\nthis week with her sister, Mrs.\nEdgar Long.\nMr. and Mrs. Dunkle,\nCandee and Miss Helen Helpman\nwent to Colton last Sunday to attend\nthe ball game. Burl Emmett took\nthem over in his car.\nMrs. Robert Brown and daughter\nBlanche of Big Bear ridge are spend\ning a couple days in Kendrick visit\ning with friends.\nTom McDowell gave the front of\nhis store building a new coat of\npaint.\nFrank\na\nto\n! to\nby\nbe\nto\nto\nRepublican and Democratic in\nCHARLES EVANS HUGHES\nNOMINATED by the republican\nnational convention held at Chicago,\nJune 10, as a candidate for the\npresidency of the United States.\nCharles W. Fairbanks will be his\nrunning mate.\nLATAH DELEGATES\nTD\nCommittees Met\nMoscow, Idaho, June 13.—Repub\nlican and democratic county com\nmittees of Latah county met this\nafternoon and named delegates to\nthe state platform conventions to\nbe held at Boise/ June 27. The\nmeeting of the progressive com\nmittee was adjourned to some j\nfuture date, though it was not i\na\ndetermined whether delegates would\nbe named.\nThere was little interest taken at\neither the republican or democratic ■\nmeetings. At both meetings a !\ncommittee was named to adopt re\nsolutions which are in preparation\nthis evening. The following are\ndelegates for the respective conven\ntions:\nRepublican—Burton L. French,\nMoscow; William E. Lee, Moscow;\nE. W. Porter, Juliaetta; James Gar\ndiner. Potlatch; F. A. David, Mos\ncow; Fred Nagel, Genesee; Francis\nJenkins, Moscow; James S.

W.\nSuppiger, Moscow.—Star-Mirror, j\n-\nAnother Auto Accident\nof\nProf. Joliff had an accident with\nhis car Wednesday while driving up\nthe Potlach grade out of Juliaetta.\nHe killed his engine and he and the\nother occupants of the car got out\nbut forgot to put on the brakes.\nWhile Mr. Joliff was cranking the\ncar it began to run backward and\nwent over the grade. The car was\nbadly damaged. Mr. Joliff was\n| principal of the Juliaetta school two\nyears ago and is now principal at\nOrofino.\nTom Daugherty was visiting in\nSpokane this week.\nMrs. C. G. Compton and daugh\nter, Miss Edith were visitors in\nJuliaetta Thursday.\nThe Barnum Lumber Co., is\nerecting a new shed for storing i\nlumber in the yards. j\nOOSINESS MEN\nMETLAST FRIDAY\nMatters of Interest to\'The\nCommunity Discussed\nAt a meeting of the Commercial\nClub Friday night of last week it\nwas definitely decided not to hold\na celebration here the Fourth of\nJuly. Southwick has advertised a\ncelebration to be held there on the\nFourth and Big Bear ridge is going\nto celebrate at Atwater lake so it\nwas thought best not to attempt a\ncelebration here.\nThe matter of giving a fair in\nthe fall was brought up and enthu\nsiastically received. Kendrick seems\nto be united in the idea of a fair\nand the interest already being shown\nby the business men of the town\nassures the success of the enterprise.\nGeneral sentiment seems to be to\nmake the fair this fall the biggest\nand best thing that Kendrick has\never undertaken. The idea of\ntreating everyone who comes, as a\nguest rather than a customer, will\nbe the motto of the Fair Association.\nMr. Barnum made the proposition\nto furnish lumber at a reasonable\nprice at the mill to build a fence\naround the ball ground, the lumber\nto be hauled by anyone who\nmight volunteer the work. The\nfence to be erected by the business\nmen who will also volunteer their\nservices. This would give the Fair\nAssociation an opportunity of mak\nin K much more elaborate prepara\nit was suggested and unanimously\napproved that season tickets for the\ntions than it has ever been able to\nmake before and would give a per\nmanent place to hold the fair and\nalso provide a ball ground for the\nteam next year.\nThe proposition was accepted and\na committee appointed to meet with\nthe town council to get permission\nfrom them to use the ground.\nfair be sold as that would give the\nmanagement something to start on\nand give a general idea of the\namount of support that might be\nexpected,\nMr. Atchison offered to furnish\nthe timbers necessary to be used to\nstraighten the "goose neck" in the\nroad on Powell grade, between Ken\ndrick and Juliaetta. John Woody\nsaid he would put the proposition\nup to the county commissioners and\nhe believed there was no question\nbut that they would make a liberal\ncash donation toward meeting the\nexpense of making the improvement.\nThe matter was put to a vote and\npassed and the road committee of\nthe Chamber of Commerce author\nized to go ahead with the work.\nOfficers for the ensuing year were\nelected as follows: Ralph Knepper,\npresident and H. P. Hull, secretary.\nj There being no other business the\nmeeting adjourned\nA Possible Candidate\nSome time ago the Lewiston Tri\nbune published an article suggest\ning Wickliffe R. Smith of South\nwick as a candidate for Superinten\ndent of Public Instruction on the\nRepublican ticket for Nez Perce\ncounty. The article brought fourth\nmany expressions of approval from\nresidents of the county and Mr.\nSmith has been urged to make the\nrace. He has been a resideht of the\ncounty for over sixteen years and\nhas a large acquaintance.\nMr. Smith has served two terms\nin the legislature and his long\nexperience in school work in the\ncounty together with his educational\nqualifications would make him a\nstrong candidate for the position,\nHe seems to be the most likely\nj candidate of any in the county.\n• • ■\nPRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON\nWho will lead the democratic party in the fall election. He is the\nunanimous choice of a united party and his nomination at the St. Louis\nConvention has been a fore-gone conclusion.\nLatah County Schools\nThe largest number of pupils in\nthe history of the Latah county\neighth grade schools took the exami\nnations the present year, according\nto figures compiled by Miss Bryden,\ncounty superintendent. A list of\nthe eighth grade pupils has been\nprepared by Miss Bryden.\nAccording to her figures 214 di\nplomas were issued to schools ex\nclusive of Moscow and the Ursuline\nacademy which did not take the\nstate examinations this year. Mos\ncow is a Class A independent dis\ntrict, the only one in the county.\nAccording to comparisons only 158\ndiplomas were issued in 1915 ex\nclusive of Moscow and Ursuline\nacademy.\nDue to increased interest in edu\ncation, the compulsory attendance\nlaw and better teaching due to the\nhigh standard now required of\nteachers, the records show the small\nest per cent of failures in the his\ntory of the county. The average\nage of the pupils taking the exami\nnations is lower. The minimum\nage completing the eighth grade\nthis year is 12 years, 87 taking\nexaminations giving their ages as\n16, 32 as 17 years, 8 as 18, and 1\nas 19 years. The average age is\nfrom 13 to 15.\nThe highest class average was\nmade by Potlatch and Catherine\nGleave, a member of the Potlatch\nclass, made the highest average\nattained by any pupil, 94 per cent.\nThe highest average made by a Troy\npupil was attained by Carl Halstrom\nat 92 1-3 per cent. - This pupil was\nthe winner in the county spelling\ncontest this year and will rep\nresent Latah county at the inter\nstate spelling contest in Spokane\nthis fall. Chris Carl Zoyer made\nthe highest average of the Kendrick\nclass with 92 1-9 per cent and Cecil\nA. Boliou secured the highest aver\nage in the Genesee class with 90 1-9\nper cent. The highest average\nmade by a pupil in a one-room\nrural school went to Inez Johnson\nof the Bear Creek school at 90 1-3\nper cent.\nBoy\ncold\nThe Camp Fire Girls and\nScouts had a picnic at the twu (\nspring in Brady Gulch Wednesday\n• • • • l I\nevening.

Van Cleve at Reubens, taking\ncanned meats, fruit, crackers and\ncheese.\nJune 14.—Daniel Ackley, travel\ning guard for the Idaho state peni\ntentiary, arrived in Lewiston\nWednesday to join in the search for\nthe escaped convicts from the White\nbird honor camp, Davis and Smead,\nand in company with Deputy Sher\niff Welker organized a posse here\nto seek the fugitives in Webb can\nyon.\nSheriff Paige and Sheriff Yates\nare engaged in the search in the\nvicinity of Mason butte.\n_\nKennedy, while digging a j\nwell for the Potlatch Electric Co.. :\nreceived some painful bruises. He\nJohn Kennedy Injured\nJohn\nwas in the bottom of the well, which\nwas about ten feet deep, and Frank\nMeyers was above, pulling a wheel\nbarrow full of rock and dirt out of\nthe well with a windlass. When\nthe load reached the top of the\nground a leg of the wheel barrow\nbroke spilling the rock on Mr.\nKennedy\'s head. His injuries were\nvery painful but not serions.

The Ken\ndrick business men have been prac\nticing every evening this week and\nare in fine condition to play. Many\nthanks are due "Ole" Grenolds for\nhauling the players to the ball park\nevery evening in his car.\nThe Kendrick line-up is composed\nprincipally of has-beens such as A.\nE. Wilcox, Waide, Woody, Comp\nton and others, but a great deal is\nexpected of them nevertheless.\nWilcox weighs something like three\nhundred pounds so it will be im\npossible to knock the ball through\nhim. Woody and Waide were\nbarred from practice because every\ntime they hit the ball it was lost\nin the brush across the Potlatch.\nCompton runs bases like a rabbit\nand if he gets a base on balls it is\ngood for a home run any time.\nManager Wilcox unearthed so\nmany old moth-eaten ball players\naround town when he called for\nvolunteers for the Friday game,\nthat it will be hard to simmer the\nnumber down to only nine men.\nThe fact that almost enough players\nhave journeyed to the ball ground\nevery evening to compose two\nteams, is a good indication of the\ninterest taken.\nThe proceeds of the game will be\nturned over to the Kendrick ball\nteam to help defray the expense of\nthe season. The band has cheer\nfully volunteered its services and\nwill play before and during the\ngame.\nThe line-up of the local team will\nbe sifted out of the following\nbunch:—Patton, Wilcox (manager)\nRandall, Porter, Thomas, Knepper,\nWoody, Dunkle, Flo, Waide, Wenz\nlaff, Long, C. G. Compton and many\nothers.\nNez Perce Case Decided\nBoise, Idaho, June 13.—The com\nmissioners of Nez Perce county had\nno legal right to make an appropria\ntion of $2500 to the Northwest Live\nStock association.\nThe supreme court of this state\nso holds in a per curiam decision\nhanded down today in the case of\nH. M. Fluharty versus the board of\ncounty commissioners of Nez Perce\ncounty and the Northwest Live\nStock association. That tribunal,\ntherefore, holds under the provi\nsions of section 4, article 12 of the\nstate constitution that section 3040\nof the revised codes contravenes the\nconstitutional provision, and is\ntherefore unconstitutional, null and\nvoid.\nThe decision is of unusual im\nportance in that it effects the right\nof county commissioners in the mat\ntgr of making donations to private\nfairs or associations.\nTuesday afternoon twelve of the\nQueen Esther Circle girls with their\nleader Mrs. Best went on a hike up\nBrady gulch.

They\nwill "point with pride" to the\nachievements of the party issuing\nthem and "view with alarm" the\naggressions made by the opposing\nparties. These platforms, fortun\nately, are no longer taken seriously\nby the man who thinks but are re\ngarded as nothing more than politi\ncal bunkum designed primarily as\nvote catchers. There was a time\nwhen political platforms meant\nsomething but now they are so care\nfully worded that they can readily\nbe interperted to meet the views of\nthe local constituency—in one sec\ntion of the country they mean\none thing in other sections another.\nOf late years party platforms are\ndrafted mainly for the display of\nrhetorical flourishes and to demon\nstrate in a practical way, the flexi\nbility of the English language. Of\ncourse most of our readers will not\nread them and it is just as well\nthat they do not. A party out of\npower makes the most radical\npromises and the party in power\nwill be sure to duplicate their rivals.\nWere we dependent on party\nplatforms to guide us in our voting\nwe would indeed be in a sorry\nplight. Fortunately the American\npeople have been thinking for them\nselves and are rapidly coming to the\nconclusion that the man placed in\nofficial position stands for much\nmore than pre-election declarations\nThis is just as true in national\naffairs as in matters that concern\nus right at home.\nSee to it that the platform of\nyour candidate is based on personal\nhonesty, integrity and efficiency and\nyou will have made no serious mis\ntake in casting your ballot. This is\nespecially necessary in the coming\nelections. Let us be watchful and\nBelect our candidates only after the\nmost pains taking investigation so\nthat an intelligent ballot will be\ncast. When this is done our free\ninstitutions will become as stable as\nthe hills and our beloved country\nwill occupy a safe and exalted posi\ntion among the nations of the earth.\nTHE NEWSPAPER\nBilly Sunday\'s opinions are not\nalways accepted as the last word on\na subject. By some he is severely\ncriticised and perhaps justly so.\nBut he is a man of ideas and seems\ntb îfliow just how to run a news\n. P*per, Following is what he thinks\nS# ought to be;\n\'^hataa straddler, a trimmer, a\ntwo faced individual with sails set\nC^tdft any breeT«. » temporizer\nWith dtpl$Be c y or tact *hat is noth\ning but deceit—in a mail or a news *\n;• paper. If to be independent meJ n8\nto be neutral in everything I\'ml\n«\'?*s*guinst that sheet and it\'s worth no\nmore to the community than the\nbundle of rags it came from. I\'m\nfii&ag fer the newspaper that\'s for\nhömething or other. I like to see\nit boil and sizzle from the volume\nnumber to the l&st end dash. I like\nfor a paper to present the various\nlogical view-points of disputed\nquestions but after that I want to\nsee the backbone of the boss come\nto the front with a positive opinion,\none way or the other. Even if he\nis against me I love him better than\nthe spineless, mushy, mollycoddle\nwhose views are no more positive\nthan a weathervane is steady in a\nKansas cyclone. So I like a ram\npant republican organ and a dog\nmatic democratic sheet, or a rip\nsnorting prohibition paper. Oh, I\ndespise the newspaper policy that\nfavors this and favors that. What\ndo you stand for? The rules of\nbattle are : Have a conviction. Take\na stand. Get into the game. Be\nfor something with all the pep,\nvigor, red-blooded ginger, tomatoe\nsaoue and peperino that\'s in you.\nSizzle for something from Sunday\ntill Saturday."\nTARIFF REVISION\nManufacturer\'s News professes\nto see a tremendous invasion of the\nUnited States from Germany, after\nthe war is over, of countless ship\nloads of manufactured products,\ndye stuffs and the like, and is in\nfeverish haste for everybody to\nwrite his congressman to revise the\ntariff to keep out. We don\'t know\nabout that. If the lack of German\ncompetition is going to keep on\nboosting native products skyward it\nwill not be easv to keep pace with a\ncontinual advance to do business.\nWe find newspaper, job stock, inks\nand other things climbing so high\nthat a proportionate advance in our\ncharges would have a tendency to\ncurtail business.\nIt is possible to boost prices so\nhigh that the public will take on\nonly a limited volume of such very\nhigh priced commodities. It is easy\nto yell, "put your prices up" with\nthe accent on "your." But if it\nreaches a point that the public re\nfuses to take it then your business\nstops. In such commonly consumed\narticles as meats, beef, pork, etc.,\nwe know very well that at 20 cents\nto 25 cents per pound they are much\nless in general use than when they\nsold for 10 to 12i cents per pound.\nThe same thing is true on other\nlines. When the prices are abnor\nmally high the consumption is sure\nto be considerably less. The dealer\nwhose line comes in for this ab\nnormal advance is sure to find him\nself doing less business than when\nvalues were normal, and this con\nclusion cannot be denied.\n* * *\nA good shower would be much\nappreciated at this time by the\nfarmers. Most of the beans planted\nare up but some of them that were\nplanted late on uneven ground have\nnot even sprouted on account of the\ndry weather. The grain crops\ngenerally looking good although\nmuch later than usual.\nSilage Crop\nIn all sections of the west, there\nis this year an increased interest in\nthe silo and silage crops. There\nhas been in the past few years a\nconstant, steady growth of the live\nstock and dairy industries and this\nhas resulted in a corresponding\nhigher level of prices for alfalfa\nand clover hay. The stock grower\nand dairyman has found it necessary\nto provide cheaper roughage and\nhe is, therefore, giving special\nj^^ntion to the growing of crops\nJ.\nior the silo. ,\nIn the lo^ÇV Irrigated valleys of\nIdaho, the prihëipal silage crop is\ncom. Where com can be grown\nsuccessfully, and where the climatic\nconditions are such that it will ma\nture before frost comes in the fall,\nthere is no crop that can be grown\nthat will take its plttëe. Corn,\nwhen cut into short pieces, packs\nvery closely and forms a compact\nmass which not dnly keeps with very\nlittle waste, but furnishes at any\ntime of the year, a uniform supply\nof succulence that has nearly the\nsame nutritive effect as pasturage.\nThere are many sections, however,\nwhere the seasons are somewhat\nshort for the successful growing of\ncorn for silage, and where the tonn\nage obtained per acre is too small.\nCorn should yield at least nine to\nten tons.

More important still, have you tried that service to your\nsatisfaction?\nPersonally, we think service merited on whole letter by itself:\nso we didn\'t say a word about the most important part of our business\nand that is the prescription department.\nWe carry many side lines, are compelled to, but first of all\nwe are pharmacists and have not neglected the prescription counter.\nThree very important things about prescription work are the ability\nof the compounder, the confidence of the customer in him and the\nquality of the drugs he uses.\nOur every day business principals, sound training and standing\nwith physicians \'can not but inspire your confidence. As for quality\nand dependibility in prescription supplies, it is only necessary to\nadd that we use only the products of the world\'s best laboratories.\nNo matter what your prescription calls for or how difficult it may\nbe to prepare, the medicine will be just what your doctor ordered\nnothing else.\nOur prices are not high - they are only fair - it would not be\nsafe to pay less. Won\'t you, if the occasion arises, try our pre\nscription service.\nRespectfully,\nH. Busse.\nP. S.

Wheat and vetch,\nand peas and oats have been used\nduring the past year and the Depart\nment of Dairying has carried on\nsome preliminary feeding work with\ndairy cattle. Two groups of four\ncows each were used. These were\npure bred Holsteins and Jerseys,\nthree Holsteins and one Jersey in\neach group. All were fed grain,\nhay and corn silage for forty days.\nOne group was changed to peas and\noats, the other to wheat and vetch\nand fed forty days, then corn silage\nwas substituted and continued. The\ngrain and hay feeding was kept con\nstant during the entire period, the\nchanges in ration being in silage\nfed.\nAt first the cattle did not eat the\ngrain silage with a keen relish but\nwithin a week\'s time, they wonld\nconsume from 30 to 35 pounds daily.\nClose observations were kept and\nwhile there was a slight decrease ^\nthe amount of milk at th® \'\n. —t tlrtie the\nchang- „\nrrom com silage to the grain\nsildgé was made, they recovered\nthis within a few days time.\nA detailed report of this work\nwill be made in later puplications\nas these investigations are being\nextended over the following year.\nConsiderable care should be taken\nat time of filling to see that grain\nsilage is cut fine and not shredded\nas it will not pack closely if such\nis the case. Since the hollow stems\nof these plants contain air, such\ncrops must be well compacted in the\n•silo or certain spoilage will take\nplace.\nE. V.

The office has to be con\nstantly prepared for any emergency\nso as to act quickly for the good of\nthe thousands of boys and thousands\nof scoutmasters and other men in\nterested in the Scouting program.\nThis was clearly illustrated in the\ndevelopments incident to the pas\nsage of the new Army bill. This\nbill had been before the Committee\nof the House and the senate for a\nlong time and had been debated pro\nand con and had received publicity\nthroughout the country as perhaps\nno other piece of legislation before\nthis session. It was not until the\nbill had actually passed the Senate\nand the House that the attention of\nthe National Office was invited by\nMr. H. H. Grogan of Washington,\nD. C., to the fa«t that section 125\nof the bill might .seriously affect\nthe rights of the fk>y Scouts of\nAmerica to eontin ue t0 wear their\npresent uniform,\nAt first the matter was not taken\nseriously, but after a Cepÿ of the\nbill was secured and it w&fc found\nthat the language used was capable\nof construction prohibiting the Boy\nScouts of America uniform, prompt\naction was taken.

Sitting hens\nshould be confined to slightly darkened\nnests at hatching time and not dis\nturbed unless they step on or pick their\nchickens when hatching. The eggshells\nand nny eggs which have not hatched\nshould be removed as soon as the\nhatching is over. Hens should be fed\nas soon as possible after the eggs are\nhatched, as feeding tends to keep them\nquiet; otherwise many hens will leave\nthe nest. In most cases it is best that\nthe hen remalfc on the nest and brood\nthe chicks for at least twenty-four\nhours after the hatching Is over.\nBrood Coops.\nHens will brood successfully ten to\nfifteen chicks early in the breeding\nseason and eighteen to twenty-five in\nwarm weather, depending upon the\nsize of the hen. Powder the hen with\na good insect powder before moving\nher^nd the chicks to the brood coop.\nThe hen should be dusted every two\nweeks or as often as necessary until\nthe chickens are weaned. If Uce be\ncome thick on the chickens, or if they\nare troubled with "head lice," a very\nlittle grease, such as lard or vaseline,\nmay be applied with the fingers on the\nhead, neck, under the wings and\naround the vent.\nBrood coops should be made so that\nthey can be closed at nights to keep\nout cats, rats and other animals, and\nenough ventilation should be allowed\nso that the hen and chicks will have\nplenty of fresh air. The hen should be\nconfined in the coop until the chickens\nare weaned, while the chickens are al\nlowed free range after they are a few\ndays old.\nThe brood coop should be cleaned at\nleast once a week and kept free from\nmites. If mites are found in the coop\nit should be thoroughly cleaned and\nsprayed with kerosene oil or crude\npetroleum. From one to two inches\nof sand or dry dirt or a thin layer of\nstraw or fine bay should be spread on\n» \'\n.**V ,*v.\nHens are confined to the brood\ncoops here shown. There Is a wired\ndoor back of the boarded front of\nthis coop, which can be slid for\nward. This arrangement furnlshep\nthe hens and chicks plenty of ven\ntilation and fresh air at night and\nprevents any animals from entering\nthe coop.\nthe floor of the coop. Brood coops\nshould he moved weekly to fresh\nground, preferably where there is new\ngrass.\nIncubator Chicks.\nChicks are usually left in the incu\nbator from twenty-four to thlrt.v-slx\nhours after hatching without feeding\nbefore they are removed to the brood\ner, which should have been in opera\ntion for a day or two at the proper\ntemperature for receiving the chick\nens. A beginner should try his brood\ning system carefully before he uses it.\nAfter placing the chickens In the brood\ner they can be given feed and water.\nThe capacity of brooders and hovers\nis often overestimated, and one-half to\ntwo-thirds of the number of chickens\ncommonly advised will do much better\nthan a larger number. The danger\nfrom fire, due frequently to careless\nness and lack of attention, is consider\nable in cheap brooders and hovers,\nwhile there Is some risk in the beet\ngrades, although proper care will re\nduce this to a minimum. Individual\nhovers in colony houses or several in\none large house are giving quite gen\neral satisfaction on small poultry\nfarms, while the pipe system of brood\ning is commonly used In large com\nmercial poultry plants and where ex\ntensive winter brooding Is done. Gaso\nline brooders, brooder stoves burning\nengine distillate oil, and a separate\nIndividual hover heated by a coal fins\nare coming into more general iisji,\neach with « capacity varying from 300\nto L5G0 chickens.\nTempérature of Broodere.\nThe best temperature at which to\nkeep a brooder or hover depends upon\nthe position of the thermometer, the\nstyle of the hover, the age of the chick\nens and the Weather conditions. Aim\nto keep the chickens comfortable. As\nthe operator learns by the actions of\nthe chickens the amount of beat they\nrequire, he can discard the thermome\nter if he desires. When too cold they\nwill crowd together and try to get\nnearer the heat It is impossible to\nstate for each case at what tempera\nture the brooders should be kept to\nraise , oung chickens; however, it will\nrun from 90 degrees up to 100 degrees\nin some cases, as some broods of chick\nens seem to require more heat than\nothers, an average being 93 to 95 de\ngrees for the first week or ten days,\nwhen the temperature is gradually re\nduced to 85 degrees for the following\nten days and then lowered to 70 or 75\ndegrees for as long as the chickens\nneed heat.\nFeeding young Chicks.\nYoung chickens should be fed from\nthree to five times daily, depending\nupon one\'s experience in feeding. The\nyoung chicks may be fed any time\nafter they are thirty-six to forty-eight\nhours old, whether they are with a hen\nor in a brooder. The first feed may\ncontain either hard boiled eggs, john\nnycake, stale bread, pinhead oatmeal\nor rolled oats, which feeds or combina\ntions may be used with good results.\nFeed the breadcrumbs, rolled oats or\nJohnnycake mixtures, moistened with\nwater, five times dally for the first\nweek, then gradually substitute for one\nor two feeds of the mixture finely\ncracked grains of equal parts by weight\nThe frame here Illustrated Is cov\nered with wire netting to protect\nfeed of young chicks from the older\nfowls.\nof cracked wheat, finely cracked com\nand pinhead oatmeal or hulled oats, to\nwhich about 5 per cent of cracked peas\nor broken rice and 2 per cent of char\ncoal, millet or rape seed may be added.\nAfter the chicks are ten days old a\ngood growing mash, composed of two\nparts by weight of bran, two parts mid\ndlings, one part eornmeal, one part low\ngrade wheat flour or red dog flour and\n10 per cent sifted beef scrap may be\nplaced in a hopper aud left before them\nat all times. As soon as the chickens\nwill eat the whole wheat, cracked com\nand other grains the small size chick\nfeed « an be eliminated.\nI" Imrcoal, grit, oyster shell and\nok ter should be kept before the\nchU . ..s at all times, and cracked or\nground bone may be fed where the\nchickens are kept in small bare yards,\nbut the latter feed Is not necessary for\nchickens that have a good range.\nExterminate Poultry Vermin.\nThe roosts should be well sprayed\nwith some good solution to keep out\nthe lice and mites. If you do this a\ncouple of times a week you will have\nbut-lit tic trouble with the vermin. So\nmany people complain about lice. If\nthey would go at it aud give the house\na thorough cleaning and then keep it\nclean they would have no difficulty\nabout lice.\nAlfalfa For Calves.\nLet the calves have ton to twelve\npounds of good silage and what alfalfa\nhay they care to eat. In addition, feed\nenough grain to keep them In good con\ndition, using a mixture of equal parts\nby weight ground corn or corn and cob\nmeal and wheat bran.\n++++++++++++++++++\n+ +\n+ POULTRY NOTE8, +\n+ +\n+ Green food helps to balance +\n+ the diet of chicks, and they need +\n+ an abundance and variety of +\n+ green feeding stuffs. +\n+ Boiled rice, cooked and season- +\n+ ed with a little salt, pays when *\n+ fed to the young chicks. +\n+ Chicks more frequently pant +\n+ for breath In a brooder that is +\n+ badly ventilated than in one that +\nv is overheated. *\n+ Brooders must be kept at a +\n+ comfortable temperature at all +\n+ times, because warmth Is the +\n+ baby chick\'s only chance for sur- +\n+ vivlng. +\nv After the nineteenth day It is +\n+ never advisable to let curiosity +\n+ ruin a good hatch.

Farm-manage\nment records show that farms are\noften either too small or too large for\nthe most successful farming. There\nmay be too few as well as too many\nacres. A man may not have enough\nland or be "land poor," thereby\nrendering all his acres unprofitable.\nAbout 30 years ago a Wisconsin\nfarmer with a large family was\ndeeply in debt. His farm consisted\nos 120 acres, half of which was un\nder the plow. The remainder was\nwoodland and expensive to clear.\nFor twelve years the farmer had\nnot been quite able to meet his in\nterest. To him the whole farm\nconsisted of unprofitable acres. He\nfinally decided that the farm was\ntoo small for the most efficient use\nof the labor available. Having an\nopportunity, be bought an adjoining\n80 acres of cleared land, going in\ndebt the full amount of the pur\nchase price. From that time on\nthe farm was prosperous, and in 10\nyears the entire farm was paid for\nand enough additional money saved\nto build a good house and barn.\nDuring this period there had been\nno great change in prices of farm\nproducts. The smaller farm had\nbeen unprofitable because the over\nhead expenses were too high for so\nsmall a business. In this case acres\nwere made profitable by increasing\ntheir number.\nIn the early nineties a North\nDakota farmer owned 3 quarter\nsections of land. His farm was\nquite heavily mortgaged and for a\nnumber of years he had not been\nable to pay interest in full. His\nfamily was small and for most of\nthe work he had to depend on hired\nhelp. He concluded that under the\ncircumstances he was working, or\ntrying to work, too many acres.\nFinally he sold a quarter section and\npaid his debts. Seven years later\nhe had $5,000 in the bank. In\ncreased prices of farm products\nduring this period only account in\npart for this farmer\'s increased\nprosperity. In this case all the\nacres had been unprofitable largely\nbecause there were too many of\nthem.— J. C.
