In the Deliver court\nover which lie presides, .Judge\nLindsay a few days ago, in refusing\nto sentence two youths\nconvicted of giving liquor to girls,\nraked fore and aft wealthy citizens\nfor keeping "well stocked\ncellars," while "some poor devil"\nis sentenced for drinking blind\ntiger whiskey. "Our high society\nour substantially well-to-do\npeople?are making a mockery\nof the law," said .Judge Lindsay.\n"They are the ones responsible\nfor this business and they furnish\nthe temptation to the unemployed\nand the ignorant to engage in\nit." There is soiue truth in what\n.Judge Lindsay says, but. the effori\nto excuse the man without\nwork or the "ignorant" (no one\n111 in.* country is ignorant ol tlie\nliquor laws) lor engaging in the\n11<I ior business because the example\nmay have been set by some\none of better standing in the common\nly is reasoning too far fetched\nto be indorsed generally. Lack\nof employment justifies no one\nin selling liquor. There ought to\nbe excuse for the man who finds\nit neeesary to take bread that\ndoes not belong to him to ward\noff starvation, but a different\nproposition is presented in tnc\nease of the man who breaks the\nlaw of the land for profit, as is\nalways the incentive for liquor\nselling. The injujstice of the enforcement,\nor lack of enforcement.\nof the liquor laws is found\nin this?that the well-to-do ami\ninfluential are not molested for\nhaving liquor in their possession,\nwhile the poor white man and negro\nare haled into court for the\nsame offense. This is the fault\nof the officers whose duty it is to\napprehend law violators and not\nof the law itself.\n"Never!" exclaims the Newberry\nObserver in commenting on\nl lie suggest ion that Governor I\'ox\nagain be nominated by the Democrat\nie party for the presidency.\nI\'erhaps it \\\\;ould be poor politics\nto again put up Governor Cox. I\nluit there was nothing in his campaign\nlast year for the country\nto he ashamed of. He was heateii.\njust as any other Democrat\nwould have heen beaten, hut it is\ndoubtful whether any man the\nparty might have put forward as\nits leaders would have done better.\nOne thing Governor Cox\'s\ncampaign proved was that he was\nbig enough to he president. Intellectually.\nhe outranked Harding.\nFor proof of the assertion\none needs hut to read the campaign\nspeeches of the two men.\nOne of the chief factors in the\ndefeat <d\' Governord\'ox was that\ntoo many men and newspapers\nwhich should have helped him\n"lay down on the job." Perhaps\nthey scented Republican success\nand wanted to be in position to\nsay that they did nothing against\nthe Republican nominee. j\nIn his final report to the war j\ndepartment, dated September 1, |\n1010. Gen. lVrshhnr in recounting\ntin pari taken by tlu* American \'\narmy in winning the World war\ngave the credit for breaking the\nllindenhurg line to the 30th division.\ncomposed of troops from\nthe Carolina* and Tennessee. But\nnow steps forward Weeks, secretary\nof war. to say that the 27th\ndivision (New York National\nGuard) did as much to breach the\nGerman fortifications as the boys\nfrom\' the South and that credit\nfor the achievement belongs in\ncipiul degree to both divisions. ^\nEver since these two division* returned\n-from overseas there has\nbeen put forward by New York\nnewspapers the claim that this\ngreat American victory was due\nto the work of the National\nGuardsmen from that State, and\n. _ __ _ a #4.\nu is pernaps not surprising aner\nall that Weeks, bigoted Southhating\'\nmisfit that he is, should\njoin in the effort to rob the\nSouthern soldiers of the glory\nthey earned and hand it over\nto men who did little real service.\nIt must indeed be comforting to\nthe veterans of the 30th division\nwho made so many sacrifices and\nrisked so much to serve their\ncountry to realize that the government\nnow in power at Washington\nis too partizan to treat\nthem fairly. <\nPLEASANT VALLEY NEWS.\nInteresting Items From Progressive\nCommunity.\nW.
